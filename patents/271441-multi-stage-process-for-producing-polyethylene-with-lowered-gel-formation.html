Multi-stage process for producing polyethylene with lowered gel<br>
formation<br>
The present application relates to a multi-stage process for producing<br>
polyethylene resins in a reaction sequence with at least two slurry phase<br>
reactors and a gas phase reactor arranged in series. Further, the<br>
application is related to a multi-modal polymer composition comprising a<br>
polyethylene resin comprising two low molecular weight ethylene homo-<br>
or copolymer fractions having a MFR2 of 100 to 2000 g/10 min and a high<br>
molecular weight ethylene copolymer fraction, the polyethylene resin<br>
having a MFR21 of 3 to 50 g/10 min and showing a high homogeneity<br>
measured in a white spot test.<br>
Generally, the strength properties of polyethylene compositions depend<br>
on their molecular weight. The higher the molecular weight is, the greater<br>
are elasticity, stiffness and creep properties. In certain applications like<br>
film, bottle, cable coating and pipe applications manufactured by<br>
extrusion or blow molding polyethylene compositions having a high<br>
molecular weight distribution combined with a narrow molecular weight<br>
distribution show bad flowing properties and a bad processability.<br>
Therefore, different approaches have been suggested for manufacturing<br>
polyethylene compositions with a broad molecular weight distribution.<br>
One way of broadening the molecular weight distribution is to blend high<br>
and low molecular weight polyethylene fractions. However, by mechanical<br>
mixing it is difficult to get a product with sufficient homogeneity. By<br>
applying solution mixing, expensive equipment is needed so that these<br>
methods are either uneconomical or unsatisfactory.<br>
Further, by choosing suitable polymerization catalysts the broadening of<br>
the molecular weight distribution is rather limited. Furthermore, even<br><br>
though some catalysts are capable of producing a broad molecular<br>
weight distribution, their ability to produce polyethylene resins having a<br>
good balance between mechanical properties and processability is<br>
limited because the catalysts usually cannot incorporate the<br>
comonomer(s) selectively into the polymer chains having the highest<br>
molecular weight.<br>
Two stage processes for broadening the molecular weight distribution by<br>
using different hydrogen concentrations in the different stages are known<br>
in which in the first stage a polymer fraction is polymerized in the<br>
presence of a high hydrogen concentration and in the second stage in<br>
the presence of a low hydrogen concentration or vice versa. In the former<br>
case it is necessary to remove the unreacted gases and hydrogen after<br>
the first stage. In the latter case, the conventional Ziegler-Natta catalysts<br>
tend to loose their activity during the progress of polymerization already<br>
at the first stage. The rate of polymerization, which is initially high,<br>
decreases at the second reactor because of the lowered activity of the<br>
catalyst and of the high hydrogen concentration. As a consequence, the<br>
residence time in the second reactor becomes much longer than in the<br>
first stage. As a consequence a reactor of larger size has to be used in<br>
the second stage which leads to further difficulties in the control of the<br>
whole process. Furthermore, the comonomer that was used in the first<br>
polymerization stage needs to be removed from the reaction mixture so<br>
that it is not carried over to the subsequent polymerization stages.<br>
Different polymerization methods can be used in multi-stage processes.<br>
Known multi-stage processes are for example slurry phase-slurry phase<br>
processes, gas phase-gas phase processes or slurry phase-gas phase<br>
processes. An example for slurry phase-slurry phase polymerization is<br>
described in EP 580 930 disclosing two sequential loop reactors. As<br>
examples for slurry phase-gas phase polymerization processes GB 1 532<br><br>
231, US 4 309 521, US 4 368 304 and EP 517 868 are mentioned. The<br>
latter publication relates to a process for manufacturing a multimodal<br>
polyethylene resin having a bimodal and/or broad molecular weight<br>
distribution in a loop reactor and gas phase reactor arranged in series. In<br>
the first reactor stage ethylene, catalyst, cocatalyst, inert low boiling<br>
hydrocarbon and advantageously hydrogen is fed into a loop reactor for<br>
polymerizing a first polyethylene fraction, the residence time in the<br>
reactor being at least 10 minutes, at least an essential amount of reaction<br>
medium is separated and the polymer fraction is transferred to one or<br>
more gas phase reactors where the polymerization is completed in the<br>
presence of ethylene, optionally hydrogen and/or comonomer.<br>
In EP 0 797 599 a three-stage polymerization process for producing<br>
multimodal polyethylene resins is disclosed in which bimodal<br>
polyethylene with a broad molecular weight distribution is produced in<br>
two loop reactors and a gas phase reactor connected in series. The first<br>
loop reactor refers to a pre-polymerization reactor in which a polyethylene<br>
in an amount of 1 to 20 wt% of the final polyethylene resin is produced.<br>
The multi-stage processes disclosed in EP 517 868 and EP 0 797 599<br>
produce polyethylene powders where the inhomogeneity is high for some<br>
special uses due to the residence time distribution of the catalyst<br>
particles in the loop reactors and the gas phase reactors, and this may<br>
adversely affect e.g the surface properties and other properties of the<br>
polymer composition.<br>
When compounding multimodal polyethylene compositions e.g. for<br>
producing pipes, so-called "white spots" occur in the compounded<br>
material. These white spots usually have a size of below 10 to about 50<br>
micrometer and consist of high molecular weight polymer particles that<br>
have not been adequately dispersed in the composition. Further, when<br>
compounding polymer compositions e.g. for the production of films gel<br><br>
particles with a size of about 0.01 to 1 mm often occur. These gel<br>
particles also consist of high molecular weight polymer particles not<br>
adequately dispersed and appear as disfiguring inhomogeneities in the<br>
finished film. Still further, inhomogeneities in multimodal polymer<br>
compositions may also increase roughness of the surface of articles<br>
produced thereof. As a side effect of the inherent inhomogeneity in the<br>
polyethylene powder particles operational problems in the gas phase<br>
reactor may occur, such as chunk and hot-spot formation.<br>
As a measure for the homogeneity in multimodal resins the ISO 18553<br>
test can be applied. ISO 18553 originally is a method for rating pigmented<br>
spots, i.e. serves to determine how well pigments are dispersed in a<br>
polymer. As the dispersion of the pigment is dependent on the overall<br>
homogeneity of the polymer because inhomogeneities of the polymer are<br>
not coloured by the pigment, ISO 18553 can also be used as a measure<br>
for the homogeneity of a polymer by counting the non-coloured white<br>
spots and rating them according to the ISO 18553.<br>
It is hence object of the present application to provide a polymerization<br>
process which produces polyethylene resins with improved homogeneity<br>
resulting in improved gas phase reactor operation and lowered white spot<br>
and gel formation in the final polymer materials.<br>
The present invention resides in the finding that polyethylene resins with<br>
white spot dispersion of less than 4.5 after a single compounding step<br>
can be produced by a cascaded multi-stage polymerization process in<br>
which at least two slurry phase reactors and at least one gas phase<br>
reactor are arranged in series. It has surprisingly been found that by<br>
using at least two loop reactors and at least one gas phase reactor<br>
arranged in series the homogeneity of the polymer is improved by means<br>
of improving the residence time distribution of the catalyst resulting in<br><br>
improved gas phase reactor operation conditions and in polyethylene<br>
resins with lower gel formation.<br>
The present invention therefore relates to a process for producing<br>
polyethylene compositions comprising<br>
polymerising polyethylene resins in a cascaded multi-stage reaction in<br>
which the reaction steps are performed in at least two slurry phase<br>
reactors (A) and (B) and at least one gas phase reactor (C) which are<br>
arranged in series in any order wherein<br>
in reactor (A) a low molecular weight ethylene homo- or copolymer<br>
fraction having a MFR2 of 100 to 2000 g/10 min,<br>
in reactor (B) a low molecular weight ethylene homo- or copolymer<br>
fraction having an MFR2 of 100 to 2000 g/10 min, and<br>
in reactor (C) a high molecular weight ethylene copolymer fraction are<br>
polymerised, and<br>
further comprising a compounding step after polymerisation,<br>
wherein the final polyethylene composition has a MFR21 of 3 to 50 g/10<br>
min, the melt flow rates being determined according to ISO 1133.<br>
Thus, the invention concerns a continuous process for preferably<br>
preparing multimodal ethylene copolymer compositions preferably in the<br>
presence of a suitable catalyst system in a multistage polymerisation<br>
reaction, which is comprising successive slurry phase and gas phase<br>
polymerisations followed by a compounding step. In a preferred<br>
embodiment the cascaded multistage reaction consists of two slurry<br>
phase reactors (A) and (B) and a gas phase reactor (C).<br><br>
The cascaded multistage reaction may comprise more than 2 slurry<br>
phase reactors and 1 gas phase reactors. Due to economic<br>
considerations it is preferred at the moment that the upper limit of slurry<br>
phase reactors is 10 and of gas phase reactors is 5.<br>
Usually, a polyethylene composition comprising at least two polyethylene<br>
fractions, which have been produced under different polymerisation<br>
conditions resulting in different (weight average) molecular weights for<br>
the fractions, is referred to as "multimodal". The prefix "multi" relates to<br>
the number of different polymer fractions of the composition consisting<br>
of. Thus, for example, a composition consisting of two fractions only is<br>
called "bimodal".<br>
The form of the molecular weight distribution curve, i.e. the appearance of<br>
the graph of the polymer weight fraction as function of its molecular<br>
weight, of such a multimodal polyethylene will show two or more maxima<br>
or at least be distinctly broadened in comparison with the curves for the<br>
individual fractions.<br>
Preferably, the final polyethylene compositions produced by the inventive<br>
process are multimodal polyethylene compositions, more preferably<br>
bimodal polyethylene compositions.<br>
As catalyst system any system of catalyst and optionally cocatalyst can<br>
be used suitable for polymerising polyethylene resins. Especially suitable<br>
are Ziegler-Natta and metallocene catalyst systems. In a preferred<br>
embodiment the polymerisation is carried out in the presence of a<br>
Ziegler-Natta catalyst. The catalyst system can be fed to any<br>
polymerisation stage but preferably is fed to the first polymerisation<br>
stage. Most preferably the catalyst system is only fed to the first<br>
polymerisation stage. The catalyst may be transferred into the<br>
polymerisation zone by any means known in the art. It is thus possible to<br><br>
suspend the catalyst in a diluent and maintain it as homogeneous slurry.<br>
Especially preferred is to use oil having a viscosity from 20 to 1500<br>
mPa*s as diluent, as disclosed in WO-A-2006/063771. It is also possible<br>
to mix the catalyst with a viscous mixture of grease and oil and feed the<br>
resultant paste into the polymerisation zone. Still further, it is possible to<br>
let the catalyst settle and introduce portions of thus obtained catalyst<br>
mud into the polymerisation zone in a manner as disclosed, for instance,<br>
in EP-A-428 054.<br>
The reactors in the cascaded multistage reaction can be arranged in any<br>
series whereby the third reaction step is preferably carried out in reactor<br>
(C). It is further preferred that the first reaction step is carried out in<br>
reactor (A). Further, the second reaction step is preferably carried out in<br>
reactor (B). In the most preferred embodiment a three step reaction<br>
sequence is arranged in the following series: The first reaction step is<br>
carried out in slurry phase reactor (A), the second reaction step is carried<br>
out in slurry phase reactor (B) and the third reaction step is carried out in<br>
gas phase reactor (C).<br>
In slurry phase polymerisation the polymer particles formed in the<br>
polymerisation together with the catalyst fragmented and dispersed within<br>
the particles, are suspended in fluid hydrocarbon. The slurry phase is<br>
agitated to enable the transfer of reactants from the fluid into the<br>
particles.<br>
The polymerisation in at least one of the slurry phase reactors (A) and<br>
(B), preferably in both reactors (A) and (B) usually takes place in an inert<br>
diluent, typically a hydrocarbon diluent which is selected from a group<br>
comprising C3 to C8 hydrocarbons, such as methane, ethane, propane, n-<br>
butane, isobutane, hexanes such as n-hexane, heptanes, octanes etc. or<br>
their mixtures. Preferably the diluent is a low boiling hydrocarbon having<br>
from 1 to 4 carbon atoms or a mixture of such hydrocarbons. An<br><br>
especially preferred diluent is propane, possibly containing minor<br>
amounts of methane, ethane and/or butane. The inert diluent can be the<br>
same or different in the different polymerisation steps.<br>
The ethylene content in the fluid phase of the slurry in at least one of the<br>
slurry phase reactors (A) and (B), preferably in both reactors (A) and (B)<br>
may be from 2 to 50 % by mole, preferably from 3 to 20 % by mole, and in<br>
particular from 5 to 15 % by mole. The benefit of having a high ethylene<br>
concentration is that the productivity of the catalyst is increased but the<br>
drawback is that.more ethylene then needs to be recycled than if the<br>
concentration was lower.<br>
The temperature in the slurry phase polymerisation in at least one of the<br>
slurry phase reactors (A) and (B), preferably in both reactors (A) and (B)<br>
is typically from 50 to 115 °C, preferably from 60 to 110 °C and in<br>
particular from 70 to 100 °C. The pressure is typically from 1 to 150 bar,<br>
preferably from 1 to 100 bar in at least one of the reactors (A) and (B),<br>
preferably in both reactors (A) and (B).<br>
The slurry phase polymerisation in at least one of the slurry phase<br>
reactors (A) and (B), preferably in both reactors (A) and (B) may be<br>
conducted in any known reactor used for slurry phase polymerisation.<br>
Such reactors include a continuous stirred tank reactor and a loop<br>
reactor. It is especially preferred to conduct the polymerisation in a loop<br>
reactor. In such reactors the slurry is circulated with a high velocity along<br>
a closed pipe by using a circulation pump. Loop reactors are generally<br>
known in the art and examples are given, for instance, in US-A-4,582,816,<br>
US-A-3,405, 109, US-A-3,324,093, EP-A-479 186 and US-A-5,391,654.<br>
It is sometimes advantageous to conduct the slurry phase polymerisation<br>
above the critical temperature and pressure of the fluid mixture. Such<br>
operations are described in US-A-5,391,654. In such an operation the<br><br>
temperature is typically at least 85 °C, preferably at least 90 °C.<br>
Furthermore the temperature is typically not higher than 110 °C,<br>
preferably not higher than 105 °C. The pressure under these conditions is<br>
typically at least 40 bar, preferably at least 50 bar. Furthermore, the<br>
pressure is typically not higher than 150 bar, preferably not higher than<br>
100 bar. In a preferred embodiment at least one polymerization step,<br>
preferably all polymerization steps in the slurry phase reactors (A) and<br>
(B), are carried out under supercritical conditions whereby the reaction<br>
temperature and reaction pressure are above equivalent critical points of<br>
the mixture formed by hydrocarbon medium, monomer, hydrogen and<br>
optional comonomer and the polymerization temperature is lower than the<br>
melting temperature of the polymer formed.<br>
It is preferred that the temperature and the pressure of the reaction in the<br>
slurry phase reactors (A) and (B), differ by not more than 10 %, preferably<br>
from 0 % to 9 %.<br>
The slurry may be withdrawn from at least one of the slurry phase<br>
reactors, preferably all slurry phase reactors either continuously or<br>
intermittently. A preferred way of intermittent withdrawal is the use of<br>
settling legs where the slurry is allowed to concentrate before<br>
withdrawing a batch of the concentrated slurry from the reactor. The use<br>
of settling legs is disclosed, amongst others, in US-A-3,374,211, US-A-<br>
3,242,150 and EP-A-1 310 295. Continuous withdrawal is disclosed,<br>
amongst others, in EP-A-891 990, EP-A-1 415 999, EP-A-1 591 460 and<br>
WO-A-2007/025640. The continuous withdrawal is advantageously<br>
combined with a suitable concentration method as disclosed in EP-A-1<br>
415 999 and EP-A-1 591 460.<br>
Settling legs are used to concentrate the slurry that is withdrawn from the<br>
reactor. The withdrawn stream thus contains more polymer per volume<br>
than the slurry within the reactor in average. This has the benefit that less<br><br>
liquid needs to be recycled back to the reactor and thereby the costs of<br>
the equipment are lower. In commercial scale plants the fluid which is<br>
withdrawn with the polymer evaporates in a flash tank and from there it is<br>
compressed with a compressor and recycled into the slurry phase<br>
reactor.<br>
However, the settling legs withdraw the polymer intermittently. This<br>
causes the pressure and also other variables in the reactor to fluctuate<br>
with the period of the withdrawal. Also the withdrawal capacity is limited<br>
and depends on the size and number of settling legs. To overcome these<br>
disadvantages continuous withdrawal is often preferred.<br>
The continuous withdrawal, on the other hand, has the problem that it<br>
typically withdraws the polymer in the same concentration as it is present<br>
within the reactor. To reduce the amount of hydrocarbons to be<br>
compressed the continuous outlet is advantageously combined with a<br>
suitable concentration device, such as a hydrocyclone or sieve, as<br>
disclosed in EP-A-1 415 999 and EP-A-1 591 460. The polymer-rich<br>
stream is then directed to a flash and the polymer-lean steam is returned<br>
directly into the reactor.<br>
In reactor (A) a polyethylene fraction with a MFR2 of 100 to 2000 g/10 min,<br>
preferably 200 to 1000 g/10 min, most preferably 300 to 800 g/10 min is<br>
polymerised.<br>
For adjusting the MFR2 of the polyethylene fraction polymerised in reactor<br>
(A) preferably hydrogen is introduced into the reactor. The hydrogen feed<br>
is preferably adjusted to the ethylene feed in order to fulfil a hydrogen to<br>
ethylene ratio in reactor (A) of 250 to 1000 mol/kmol, more preferably of<br>
500 to 800 mol/kmol.<br><br>
In reactor (B) a polyethylene fraction with a MFR2 of 100 to 2000 g/10 min,<br>
preferably 150 to 1000 g/10 min, most preferably 200 to 600 g/10 min is<br>
polymerised.<br>
For adjusting the MFR2 of the polyethylene fraction polymerised in reactor<br>
(B) preferably hydrogen is introduced into the reactor. The hydrogen feed<br>
is preferably adjusted to the ethylene feed in order to fulfil a hydrogen to<br>
ethylene ratio in reactor (B) of 250 to 1000 mol/kmol, more preferably of<br>
500 to 800 mol/kmol.<br>
It is preferred that the relation of the melt flow rates of the ethylene homo-<br>
or copolymer fractions produced in reactors (A) and (B) are within the<br>
following range:<br>
0.1 
More preferably the melt flow rates of the ethylene homo- or copolymer<br>
fractions produced in reactors (A) and (B) are within the following range:<br>
0.5 
The polyethylene fraction produced in reactor (A) can be an ethylene<br>
homo- or copolymer fraction. If polymerising a copolymer comonomers<br>
preferably are selected from the group comprising 1-butene, 1-hexene, 4-<br>
methyl-1-pentene, 1-octene or their mixtures. In a preferred embodiment<br>
in reactor (A) an ethylene homopolymer is polymerised so that no<br>
comonomer is fed to this reaction stage.<br>
The residence time and the polymerisation temperature in reactor (A) are<br>
adjusted as such as to polymerise an ethylene homo- or copolymer<br>
fraction typically in an amount of 10 to 30 wt%, preferably 15 to 25 wt% of<br>
the total polyethylene resin.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment the polymer fraction produced in slurry phase<br>
reactor (A) is transferred to slurry phase reactor (B).<br>
Also the polyethylene fraction produced in reactor (B) can be an ethylene<br>
homo- or copolymer fraction. If polymerising a copolymer comonomers<br>
preferably are selected from the group comprising 1-butene, 1-hexene, 4-<br>
methyl-1-pentene, 1-octene or their mixtures. The comonomer selected in<br>
the reactor stages (A) and (B) can be the same or different. In a preferred<br>
embodiment in reactor (B) an ethylene homopolymer is polymerised so<br>
that no comonomer is fed to this reaction stage.<br>
In reactor (B) the residence time and the polymerisation temperature are<br>
adjusted as such as to polymerise an ethylene homo- or copolymer<br>
fraction typically in an amount of 15 to 40 wt%, preferably 20 to 35 wt% of<br>
the total polyethylene resin.<br>
In comparison to the multistage processes disclosed in EP 517 868 and<br>
EP 0 797 599 the single slurry phase polymerization stage producing up<br>
to 50 wt% of the total polyethylene is split in at least two different slurry<br>
phase polymerisation stages in which preferably a combined amount of<br>
low molecular weight ethylene homo- or copolymer of at least 53 wt%,<br>
more preferably of at least 55 wt% but preferably not more than 70 wt%,<br>
more preferably not more than 65 wt% of the total polyethylene resin is<br>
polymerized. This split causes an improved residence time of catalyst<br>
particles in the slurry phase stages surprisingly results in an improved<br>
homogeneity of the final polyethylene product.<br>
The polymer fraction produced in the sequential slurry phase reactors<br>
preferably is transferred to the at least one gas phase reactor (C).<br>
In a fluidised bed gas phase reactor an olefin is polymerised in the<br>
presence of a polymerisation catalyst in an upwards moving gas stream.<br>
The reactor typically contains a fluidised bed comprising the growing<br><br>
polymer particles containing the active catalyst located above a<br>
fluidisation grid.<br>
The polymer bed is fluidised with the help of a fluidisation gas comprising<br>
the olefin monomer, eventually comonomer(s), eventually chain growth<br>
controllers or chain transfer agents, such as hydrogen, and eventually<br>
inert gas. The inert gas can thereby be the same or different as the inert<br>
gas used in the slurry phase reactors (A) or (B). The fluidisation gas is<br>
introduced into an inlet chamber at the bottom of the reactor. To make<br>
sure that the gas flow is uniformly distributed over the cross-sectional<br>
surface area of the inlet chamber the inlet pipe may be equipped with a<br>
flow dividing element as known in the art, e. g. US-A-4,933,149 and EP-A-<br>
684 871.<br>
From the inlet chamber the gas flow is passed upwards through the<br>
fluidisation grid into the fluidised bed. The purpose of the fluidisation grid<br>
is to divide the gas flow evenly through the cross-sectional area of the<br>
bed. Sometimes the fluidisation grid may be arranged to establish a gas<br>
stream to sweep along the reactor walls, as disclosed in WO-A-<br>
2005/087261. Other types of fluidisation grids are disclosed, amongst<br>
others, in US-A-4,578,879, EP 600 414 and EP-A-721 798. An overview is<br>
given in Geldart and Bayens: The Design of Distributors for Gas-fluidised<br>
Beds, Powder Technology, Vol. 42, 1985.<br>
The fluidisation gas passes through the fluidised bed. The superficial<br>
velocity of the fluidisation gas must be higher than the minimum<br>
fluidisation velocity of the particles contained in the fluidised bed, as<br>
otherwise no fluidisation would occur. On the other hand, the velocity of<br>
the gas should be lower than the onset velocity of pneumatic transport,<br>
as otherwise the whole bed would be entrained with the fluidisation gas.<br>
The minimum fluidisation velocity and the onset velocity of pneumatic<br>
transport can be calculated when the particle characteristics are known<br><br>
by using common engineering practice. An overview is given, amongst<br>
others, in Geldart: Gas Fluidisation Technology, J. Wiley &amp; Sons, 1996.<br>
When the fluidisation gas is contacted with the bed containing the active<br>
catalyst the reactive components of the gas, such as monomers and<br>
chain transfer agents, react in the presence of the catalyst to produce the<br>
polymer product. At the same time the gas is heated by the reaction heat.<br>
The unreacted fluidisation gas is then removed from the top of the<br>
reactor, compressed and recycled into the inlet chamber of the reactor.<br>
Prior to the entry into the reactor fresh reactants are introduced into the<br>
fluidisation gas stream to compensate for the losses caused by the<br>
reaction and product withdrawal. It is generally known to analyse the<br>
composition of the fluidisation gas and introduce the gas components to<br>
keep the composition constant. The actual composition is determined by<br>
the desired properties of the product and the catalyst used in the<br>
polymerisation.<br>
After that the gas is cooled in a heat exchanger to remove the reaction<br>
heat. The gas is cooled to a temperature which is lower than that of the<br>
bed to prevent the bed from being heated because of the reaction. It is<br>
possible to cool the gas to a temperature where a part of it condenses.<br>
When the liquid droplets enter the reaction zone they are vaporized. The<br>
vaporisation heat then contributes to the removal of the reaction heat.<br>
This kind of operation is called condensed mode and variations of it are<br>
disclosed, amongst others, in WO-A-2007/025640, US-A-4,543,399, EP-A-<br>
699 213, and WO-A-94/25495. It is also possible to add condensing<br>
agents into the recycle gas stream, as disclosed in EP-A-696 293. The<br>
condensing agents are non-polymerisable components, such as propane,<br>
n-pentane, isopentane, n-butane or isobutane, which are at least partially<br>
condensed in the cooler.<br><br>
The polymeric product may be withdrawn from the gas phase reactor<br>
either continuously or intermittently. Combinations of these methods may<br>
also be used. Continuous withdrawal is disclosed, amongst others, in<br>
WO-A-00/29452. Intermittent withdrawal is disclosed, amongst others, in<br>
US-A-4,621,952, EP-A-188 125, EP-A-250 169 and EP-A-579 426.<br>
The top part of the at least one gas phase reactor may include a so called<br>
disengagement zone. In such a zone the diameter of the reactor is<br>
increased to reduce the gas velocity and allow the particles that are<br>
carried from the bed with the fluidisation gas to settle back to the bed.<br>
The bed level may be observed by different techniques known in the art.<br>
For instance, the pressure difference between the bottom of the reactor<br>
and a specific height of the bed may be recorded over the whole length of<br>
the reactor and the bed level may be calculated based on the pressure<br>
difference values. Such a calculation yields a time-averaged level. It is<br>
also possible to use ultrasonic sensors or radioactive sensors. With these<br>
methods instantaneous levels may be obtained, which of course may then<br>
be averaged over time to obtain time-averaged bed levels.<br>
Also antistatic agent(s) may be introduced into the at least one gas phase<br>
reactor if needed. Suitable antistatic agents and methods to use them are<br>
disclosed, amongst others, in US-A-5,026,795, US-A-4,803,251, US-A-<br>
4,532,311, US-A-4,855,370 and EP-A-560 035. They are usually polar<br>
compounds and include, amongst others, water, ketones, aldehydes<br>
alcohols.<br>
The reactor may include a mechanical agitator to further facilitate mixing<br>
within the fluidised bed. An example of suitable agitator design is given in<br>
EP-A-707 513.<br>
The temperature in the gas phase polymerisation in reactor (C) typically is<br>
at least 70 °C, preferably at least 80 °C. The temperature typically is not<br><br>
more than 105 °C, preferably not more than 95 °C. The pressure is<br>
typically at least 10 bar, preferably at least 15 bar but typically not more<br>
than 30 bar, preferably not more than 25 bar.<br>
In reactor (C) the polymerisation conditions are selected as such that the<br>
final polyethylene resin preferably has a MFRS of 0.05 to 2 g/10 min, more<br>
preferably 0.1 to 1.5 g/10 min, most preferably 0.2 to 1 g/10 min.<br>
Further, final polyethylene composition has a MFR21 of 3 to 50 g/10 min,<br>
preferably 5 to 30 g/10 min, most preferably 7 to 25 g/10 min.<br>
For adjusting the melt flow rate of the polyethylene fraction polymerised<br>
in reactor (C) hydrogen may be introduced into the reactor. The hydrogen<br>
feed is preferably adjusted to the ethylene feed in order to fulfil a<br>
hydrogen to ethylene ratio in reactor (A) of 0 to 60 mol/kmol, more<br>
preferably of 10 to 40 mol/kmol.<br>
In gas phase reactor (C) an ethylene copolymer fraction is produced. The<br>
fluidisation gas stream thus comprises comonomers preferably selected<br>
from the group comprising C4 to Ce alpha-olefins, such as 1-butene, 1-<br>
hexene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, 1-octene or their mixtures. Most preferably<br>
1-hexene is used as comononer. The comonomer used in reactor (C) may<br>
be the same or different than that used in slurry phase reactors (A) and/or<br>
(B). The comonomer feed is preferably adjusted to the ethylene feed in<br>
order to fulfil a comonomer to ethylene ratio of at least 100 mol/kmol,<br>
more preferably 5 to 50 mol/kmol, most preferably 10 to 40 mol/kmol.<br>
The residence time and the polymerisation temperature in reactor (C) are<br>
adjusted as such as to polymerise an ethylene copolymer fraction<br>
typically in an amount of 30 to 75 wt%, preferably 35 to 60 wt% of the total<br>
polyethylene resin.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment the process may further comprise a pre-<br>
polymerisation step which precedes the polymerisation steps. The<br>
purpose of the pre-polymerisation is to polymerise a small amount of<br>
polymer onto the catalyst at a low temperature and/or a low monomer<br>
concentration. By pre-polymerisation it is possible to improve the<br>
performance of the catalyst in slurry and/or modify the properties of the<br>
final polymer. The pre-polymerisation step may be conducted in slurry or<br>
gas phase. Preferably the pre-polymerisation is conducted in slurry.<br>
Thus, the pre-polymerisation step may be conducted in a loop reactor.<br>
The pre-polymerisation is then preferably conducted in an inert diluent,<br>
typically a hydrocarbon diluent such as methane, ethane, propane, n-<br>
butane, isobutene, pentanes, hexanes, heptanes, octanes etc., or their<br>
mixtures. Preferably the diluent is a low boiling hydrocarbon having from<br>
1 to 4 carbon atoms or a mixture of such hydrocarbons. The most<br>
preferred diluent is propane.<br>
The temperature in the pre-polymerisation step is typically from 0 °C to 90<br>
°C, preferably from 20 °C to 70 °C and more preferably from 30 °C to 60<br>
°C.<br>
The pressure is not critical and is typically from 1 bar to 150 bar,<br>
preferably from 10 bar to 100 bar.<br>
The amount of monomer is typically such that from 0.1 grams to 1000<br>
grams of monomer per one gram solid catalyst component is polymerised<br>
in the pre-polymerisation step. As the person skilled in the art knows, the<br>
catalyst particles recovered from a continuous pre-polymerisation reactor<br>
do not all contain the same amount of pre-polymer. Instead, each particle<br>
has its own characteristic amount which depends on the residence time<br>
of that particle in the pre-polymerisation reactor. As some particles<br>
remain in the reactor for a relatively long time and some for a relatively<br><br>
short time, then also the amount of pre-polymer on different particles is<br>
different and some individual particles may contain an amount of pre-<br>
polymer which is outside the above limits. However, the average amount<br>
of pre-polymer on the catalyst typically is within the limits specified<br>
above.<br>
In addition to ethylene monomer it is possible to use one or more alpha-<br>
olefin comonomers in the pre-polymerisation step if desired. Suitable<br>
comonomers are, for example, 1-butene, 1-hexene, 4-methyl-1-pentene,<br>
1-octene and their mixtures.<br>
The molecular weight of the pre-polymer may be controlled by hydrogen<br>
as it is known in the art. Further, antistatic additives may be used to<br>
prevent the particles from adhering to each other or the walls of the<br>
reactor, as disclosed in WO-A-96/19503 and WO-A-96/32420.<br>
The catalyst components are preferably all introduced to the pre-<br>
polymerisation step. However, where the solid catalyst component and<br>
the cocatalyst can be fed separately it is possible that only a part of<br>
cocatalyst is introduced into the pre-polymerisation stage and the<br>
remaining part into the subsequent polymerisation stages. Also in such<br>
cases it is necessary to introduce as much cocatalyst into the pre-<br>
polymerisation stage as necessary to obtain a sufficient polymerisation<br>
reaction.<br>
The polyethylene resins produced according to the inventive<br>
polymerisation process show an improved homogeneity. After a single<br>
compounding step with a pigment, such as e.g. carbon black, the white<br>
spots dispersed in the final polyethylene composition preferably have a<br>
homogeneity, expressed as the white spot dispersion, of less than 4.5,<br>
more preferably 0.1 to 4.0, most preferably 0.1 to 3.5, determined<br>
according to ISO 18553.<br><br>
Another aspect of the present invention relates to a multimodal polymer<br>
composition comprising a polyethylene resin comprising<br>
(i)	a first low molecular weight ethylene homo- or copolymer fraction<br>
having a MFR2 of 100 to 2000 g/10 min,<br>
(ii) a second low molecular weight ethylene homo-or copolymer<br>
fraction having a MFR2 of 100 to 2000 g/10 min, and<br>
(iii) a high molecular weight ethylene copolymer fraction,<br>
wherein the polyethylene resin has a MFR21 of 3 to 50 g/10 min and white<br>
spots are dispersed within the final composition with a white spot<br>
dispersion of less than 4.5 after a single compounding step, the melt flow<br>
rate being determined according to ISO 1133 and the white spot test<br>
according to ISO 18553.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the multimodal polymer composition is<br>
produced by the process as described above.<br>
The multimodal polymer composition may comprise more polymer<br>
fractions than polyethylene fractions (i), (ii) and (iii). However, in a<br>
preferred embodiment the multimodal polymer composition of the<br>
invention comprises a polyethylene resin consisting of the polyethylene<br>
fractions (i), (ii) and (iii).<br>
The polyethylene fraction (i) may consist of single ethylene polymer<br>
fraction but may also comprise a mixture of different ethylene polymer<br>
fractions. This also applies for polyethylene fraction (ii) and (iii).<br>
Typically the ratio of the melt flow rates of the polyethylene fractions (i)<br>
and (ii) are within the following range:<br>
0.1 
 <br>
more preferably in the following range:<br>

Polyethylene fraction (i) is typically present in an amount of 10 to 30 wt%,<br>
preferably in an amount of 15 to 25 wt% of the total polyethylene resin.<br>

preferably a MFR2 of 200 to 1000 g/10 min, more preferably a MFR2 of 300<br>
to 800 g/10 min.<br>
The MFR2 (2.16 kg, 190°C) for polyethylene is determined according to<br>
ISO 1133. Melt flow rate and average molecular weight are inversely<br>
related to each other, i.e. a higher melt flow rate is equivalent to a lower<br>
average molecular weight and vice versa. Further, the higher the melt flow<br>
rate, the lower the viscosity of the polymeric material.<br>
It is further preferred that polyethylene fraction (i) has a weight average<br>
molecular weight Mw of 5,000 to 70,000 g/mol, more preferably 10,000 to<br>

average molecular weight Mn of 500 to 15,000 g/mol, more preferably of<br>
1,000 to 10,000 g/mol, most preferably of 1,5000 to 5,000 g/mol,<br>
determined by GPC according to ISO 16014-1, and 4.<br>
Preferably, polyethylene fraction (i) has a molecular weight distribution<br>

the MWD is determined as Mw/ Mn.<br>

embodiment polyethylene fraction (i) is an ethylene homopolymer<br>
fraction.<br>
Polyethylene fraction (ii) is typically present in an amount of 15 to 40 wt%,<br>
preferably in an amount of 20 to 35 wt% of the total polyethylene resin.<br>
Further, polyethylene fraction (ii) has a MFR2 of 100 to 2000 g/10 min,<br>
preferably a MFR2 of 150 to 1000 g/10 min, more preferably a MFR2 of 200<br>
to 600 g/10 min.<br>
It is further preferred that polyethylene fraction (ii) has a weight average<br>

50,000 g/mol, most preferably 15,000 to 35,000 g/mol, and a number<br>
average molecular weight Mn of 500 to 15,000 g/mol, more preferably of<br>
1,000 to 10,000 g/mol, most preferably of 1,5000 to 5,000 g/mol,<br>
determined by GPC according to ISO 16014-1, and -4.<br>

8.<br>

copolymer, ethylene is preferably polymerised in the presence of at least<br>
one comonomer selected from the group comprising 1-butene, 1-hexene,<br>
4-methyl-1-pentene, 1-octene or their mixtures. The at least one<br>
comonomer selected for polymerising polyethylene fractions (i) and (ii)<br>
can be the same or different. In a preferred embodiment polyethylene<br>
fraction (ii) is an ethylene homopolymer fraction.<br><br>
Polyethylene fraction (iii) is typically present in an amount of 30 to 75<br>
wt%, preferably in an amount of 35 to 60 wt% of the total polyethylene<br>
resin. In a preferred embodiment polyethylene fraction (iii) is present in<br>
an amount of 30 to 47 wt%, more preferably in an amount of 25 to 45 wt%<br>
of the total polyethylene resin.<br>
The density of polyethylene fraction (iii) preferably is 895 to 935 kg/m3,<br>
more preferably 905 to 930, determined according to ISO 1183.<br>
It is further preferred that polyethylene fraction (iii) has a weight average<br>

a number average molecular weight Mn of 10,000 to 200,000 g/mol, more<br>

Preferably, polyethylene fraction (iii) has a molecular weight distribution<br>
MWD (as Mw/ M„) of 2 to 12, more preferably 3 to 10, most preferably 4 to<br>

Polyethylene fraction (iii) refers to a copolymer, whereby ethylene is<br>
typically polymerised in the presence of at least one comonomer<br>
selected from the group comprising C4 to CB alpha-olefins, preferably<br>
selected from the group comprising 1-butene, 1-hexene, 4-methyl-1-<br>
pentene, 1-octene or their mixtures. Mostly preferred is 1-hexene.<br>
In a preferred embodiment combined polyethylene fractions (i) and (ii)<br>
are present in an amount of at least 53 wt%, more preferably in an<br>
amount of at least 55 wt% of the total polyethylene resin.<br>
The comonomer content in polyethylene fraction (iii) is preferably in the<br>
range of 0.1 to 10 wt%, more preferably 0.2 to 7.5 wt%, most preferably<br>

The polyethylene resin has a MFR21 of 3 to 50 g/10 min, preferably a<br>
MFR2, of 5 to 30 g/10 min, most preferably a MFR21 of 7 to 25 g/10 min.<br>
Further, the polyethylene resin preferably has a MFR5 of 0.05 to 2 g/10<br>
min, more preferably a MFRS of 0.1 to 1.5 g/10 min, most preferably a<br>

It is preferred that the polyethylene resin refers to a multimodal<br>
polyethylene resin, more preferably a bimodal or a trimodal polyethylene<br>
resin.<br>
The density of polyethylene resin preferably is 940 to 970 kg/m3, more<br>
preferably 945 to 960 kg/m3, determined according to ISO 1183.<br>
The polyethylene resin may be produced by any suitable process as<br>
known in the art in the presence of any suitable catalyst known in the art.<br>
However, it is preferred that the polyethylene is produced by a multi-<br>
stage process, most preferably by the cascaded multi-stage process of<br>
the present invention.<br>
The polymer composition of the present invention may further contain<br>
various additives, such as miscible thermoplastics, antioxidants, UV-<br>
stabilizers, process-stabilizers, lubricants, demolding agents, nucleating<br>
agents, acid scavengers, fillers, colouring agents and foaming agents,<br>
which can be added to the composition before, during or after the<br>
compounding in an amount of not more than 10 wt%, preferably not more<br>
than 7 wt% of the total composition.<br>
In a preferred embodiment carbon black is added to the composition in<br>
an amount of up to 4 wt%, more preferably in an amount of up to 3.5 wt%<br>
of the total composition. The carbon black can be added to the<br>
composition by any suitable means, preferably in form of a master batch<br><br>
including carbon black in an amount of more than 10 wt% of that master<br>
batch.<br>
The composition of the invention is preferably produced in a process<br>
comprising a compounding step, wherein the polyethylene resin, i.e. the<br>
blend which is typically obtained as a powder from the reactor, is<br>
extruded in an extruder and then pelletised to polymer pellets in a manner<br>
known in the art.<br>
The process of the invention comprises such a compounding step.<br>
Optionally, additives or other polymer components can be added to the<br>
composition before or during the compounding step in the amount as<br>
described above. Preferably, the composition of the invention obtained<br>
from the reactor is compounded in the extruder together with additives in<br>
a manner known in the art.<br>
The extruder may be e.g. any conventionally used extruder, preferably in<br>
a twin screw extruder. One example of suitable twin screw extruders for<br>
the present compounding step is a co-rotating twin screw extruder. Those<br>
are manufactured, amongst others, by Coperion or Japan Steel Works.<br>
Another example is a counter rotating twin screw extruder. Such extruders<br>
are manufactured, amongst others, by Kobe Steel or Japan Steel Works.<br>
The extruders typically include a melting section where the polymer is<br>
melted and a mixing section where the polymer melt is homogenised.<br>
Melting and homogenisation are achieved by introducing energy into the<br>
polymer. The more energy is introduced into the polymer the better the<br>
homogenisation effect achieved. However, too high energy incorporation<br>
causes the polymer to degrade and the mechanical properties to<br>
deteriorate. Suitable level of specific energy input (SEI) is from 150 to 350<br>
kWh/ton polymer, preferably 150 to 250 kWh/ton polymer, most<br>
preferably 170 to 200 kWh/ton polymer.<br><br>
Typical average residence time of the polymer in the extruder is from 30<br>
seconds to 10 minutes. This figure depends to some extent on the type of<br>
the extruder. However, for most extruders values from 1 minute to 5<br>
minutes result in a good combination of homogeneity and mechanical<br>
properties of the polymer composition.<br>
Suitable extrusion methods are disclosed, amongst others, in EP-A-1 600<br>
276 and WO-A-98/15591.<br>
The compounding step can be preferably effected with a feed of 5 to 100<br>
tons/h, preferably 10 to 50 tons/h.<br>
The screw speed of the extruder thereby is suitably not higher than 500<br>
rpm, preferably within the range of 200 to 500 rpm, more preferably 300<br>
to 450 rpm, most preferably 325 to 400 rpm.<br>
It is known that the temperature of the polymer melt may vary in the<br>
extruder, the highest (max) melt temperature of the composition in the<br>
extruder during the extrusion is typically more than 150 °C, preferably in<br>
the range of 220 to 350 °C, most preferably in the range of 220 to 250 °C.<br>
The benefit of the invention is that an excellent homogeneity can be<br>
obtained without extensive mixing, already by effecting once the<br>
compounding step, e.g. the preferably extrusion with production rates as<br>
defined above, and additionally, together with the high level homogeneity<br>
desirable polymer properties can be achieved/maintained.<br>
Furthermore, preferably, also the pellets obtained from that single<br>
compounding step have the above defined homogeneity levels.<br>
The determination of the homogeneity is preferably conducted from a<br>
coloured sample of these pellets by using the white spot area and/or<br>
white spot rating test method of ISO 18553 as disclosed in WO<br><br>
2006/048260. Thereby the coloured sample is obtained by effecting the<br>
above described compounding step of the polyethylene resin powder in<br>
the presence of a pigment, e.g. carbon black. If desired, other additives<br>
can also be used in said samples according to the conventional practice<br>
in the white sport determination. The polymer compositions of the<br>
invention thereby show a homogeneity, expressed as the ISO-rating of<br>
the white spots, of less than 4.5, more preferably 0.1 to 4.0, most<br>
preferably 0.1 to 3.5.<br>
Additionally the carbon black dispersion in the final composition is<br>
typically less than 1.5, more preferably in the range of 0 to 1.1, also<br>
determined according to ISO 18553.<br>
Accordingly, the polymer composition of the invention can be used in<br>
many end applications, i.a. producing articles preferably extruded articles<br>
such as pipes or films, like blown films or cast films, or moulded articles,<br>
including injection moulded articles and blow moulded articles such as<br>
bottles or barrels. The invention provides said use and the obtained<br>
articles comprising the polymer of the invention.<br>
The invention is especially useful in cases where the combined low<br>
molecular weight component (component (i) and (ii)) form a major part of<br>
the multimodal composition, for instance where the combined amount of<br>
components (i) and (ii) forms at least 53 wt%, preferably at least 55 wt%<br>
of the total polyethylene resin. The upper limit of the combined amount of<br>
the components (i) and (ii) is preferably 70 wt%, more preferably 65 wt%.<br>
The present invention thus further relates to the use of at least two slurry<br>
phase reactors for the polymerisation of a low molecular weight<br>
polyethylene fraction, which preferably forms at least 53 wt%, more<br>
preferably at least 55 wt% of the total polyethylene resin for improving the<br>
homogeneity of a multimodal polyethylene resin.<br><br>
The present invention is further characterised by means of the following<br>
examples.<br>
Examples:<br>
1. Definitions<br>
a)	Melt flow rate<br>
The melt flow rate (MFR) is determined according to ISO 1133 and is<br>
indicated in g/10 min. The MFR is an indication of the flowability, and<br>
hence the processability, of the polymer. The higher the melt flow rate,<br>
the lower the viscosity of the polymer. The MFR5 of polyethylene is<br>
measured at a temperature 190 °C and a load of 5 kg, the MFR2 of<br>
polyethylene at a temperature 190 °C and a load of 2.16 kg and the MFR21<br>
of polyethylene is measured at a temperature of 190 °C and a load of 21.6<br>
kg.<br>
b)	Density<br>
The density is measured according to ISO 1183 on compression molded<br>
specimens.<br>
c)	Measure of homogeneity<br>
The white spot area of the once compounded composition is determined<br>
following ISO 18 553 as follows:<br>
A sample of the composition (including a pigment to make the<br>
inhomogeneities visible, e.g. carbon black in an amount as listed in Table<br>
2 below) which is obtained after a single compounding step as listed in<br>
Table 1 below, is analysed by firstly obtaining 6 microtome cuts of 6<br>
different parts of the sample (thickness 
mm).<br><br>
The cuts are evaluated at a magnification of 100, and the size, i.e. the part<br>
of the surface, of the non-coloured inclusions ("white-spots",<br>
agglomerates, particles) on a total surface of each cut of 0.7 mm2 is<br>
determined. All white spots with a diameter &gt; 5 micrometer are counted.<br>
The "white spot area" is then expressed as the averaged fraction of the<br>
white spots on the total surface of the sample cut.<br>
In addition to the white spot area test, homogeneity complementary is<br>
determined to the modified ISO 18553 white spot rating test. In this test,<br>
inhomogeneities of the composition present after a single compounding<br>
step as described above, which appear as white spots, are determined<br>
and rated according to the rating scheme given in ISO 18553. The lower<br>
the composition is rated in this test the better is the homogeneity of the<br>
composition.<br>
The carbon black dispersion is also determined according to ISO 18553.<br>
