STABILIZED CALCIUM PHOSPHATE COMPLEXES<br>
The present invention relates to amorphous calcium phosphate and/or amorphous calcium fluoride phosphate stabilised by phosphopeptides. Methods of making the complexes of the invention and of treatment or prevention of dental caries, dental calculus, dental erosion/corrosion and dental hypersensitivity are provided. These have anticariogenic properties, protecting tooth structures as they remineralise (repair) early stages of dental caries, as well as other dental/medical applications (including anti-calculus, anti-erosion/corrosion and anti-dentinal hypersensitivity).<br>
Background<br>
Dental caries is initiated by the demineralisation of hard tissue of the teeth usually by organic acids produced from fermentation of dietary sugar by dental plaque odontopathogenic bacteria. Dental caries is still a major public health problem. Further, restored tooth surfaces can be susceptible to further dental caries around the margins of the restoration. Even though the prevalence of dental caries has â€¢decreased through the use of fluoride in most developed countries, the disease remains a major public health problem. Dental erosion/corrosion is the loss of tooth mineral by dietary or regurgitated acids. Dental hypersensitivity is due to exposed dentinal tubules through loss of the protective mineralized layer, cementum and dental calculus is the unwanted accretion of calcium phosphate minerals on the tooth surface. All these conditions, dental caries, dental erosion/corrosion, dental hypersensitivity and dental calculus are therefore imbalances in the level of calcium phosphates.<br>
Dental caries, dental erosion/corrosion and dental hypersensitivity can be treated with stabilized amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) or stabilized amorphous calcium fluoride phosphate (ACFP) by providing bioavailable calcium and phosphate ions to replace the lost calcium phosphate mineral. Stabilized ACP and stabilised ACFP can also bind to the surface of dental calculus and prevent or reduce further accretion. Stabilized ACP and stabilized ACFP therefore can play a major role in preventing and treating oral diseases and other medical conditions.<br>
Casein is present in milk in the form of micelles, which are believed to be roughly<br><br>
spherical particles with a radius of about 100 nm, dispersed in a continuous phase of water, salt, lactose and whey proteins (Schmidt, D.G. (1982) Dev. Dairy Chem. 1, 61-86). The casein micelles serve as a carrier of calcium phosphate providing a bioavailable source of calcium and phosphate ions for bone and teeth formation. The ability of casein micelles to maintain calcium and phosphate ions in a soluble and bioavailable state is retained by multiphosphorylated peptide fragments of the caseins known as the casein phosphopeptides (CPP). WO 98/40406 in the name of The University of Melbourne describes casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate complexes (CPP-ACP) and CPP-stabilised amorphous calcium fluoride phosphate complexes (CPP-ACFP) which have been produced at alkaline pH. Such complexes have been shown to prevent enamel demineralisation and promote remineralisatfon of enamel subsurface lesions in animal and human in situ caries models (Reynolds, 1998)<br>
The CPP which are active in forming the complexes do so whether or not they are part of a full-length casein protein. Examples of active (CPP) that can be isolated by tryptic digestion of full length casein have been specified in US Patent No. 5,015,628 and include peptides Bos asrcasein X-5P (f59-79) [1], Bos p-casein X-4P (f!-25) [2], Bos osa-casein X-4P (f46-70) [3] and Bos ctsrcasein X-4P (fl-21) [4] as follows:<br>

It has now been found that peptide-stabilized soluble, basic forms of ACP and ACFP may also be produced in a medium having a pH of less than 7.0.   Such<br><br>
complexes demonstrate a surprising level of activity to remineralise enamel subsurface lesions of teeth.<br>
It will also be understood that the term "comprises" (or its grammatical variants) as used in this specification is equivalent to the term "includes" and may be used interchangeably and should not be taken as excluding the presence of other elements or features.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
In one aspect, the present invention provides a phosphopeptide (PP) stabilized-ACP or ACFP complex, wherein the complex is formed at a pH of below 7.0. Preferably the complex is formed at a pH in the range of about 5.0 up to but below 7.0. More preferably the complex is formed at a pH range of about 5.0 to about 6.0. In a preferred embodiment, the complex is formed at a pH of about 5.5. In a preferred embodiment, the complex is suitable for dental applications. In a further preferred embodiment, the complex is suitable for application to the teeth and/or gums to promote remineralisation.<br>
By "formed at a pH of is meant that the medium in which the complex is formed has an overall pH of the defined value. The localized pH values within the medium may vary, for example in the microenvironment around the forming complex. In other words, the relevant pH value for the purposes of the present invention is the measurable pH of the medium as a whole.<br>
Preferably, the phase of the ACP is predominantly a basic phase, wherein the ACP comprises predominantly the species Ca2+, PO43" and OH". The basic phase of ACP may have the general formula [Ca3(P04)2]x[Ca2(P04)(OH)] where x Â£ 1.<br>
Preferably, the phase of the ACFP is predominantly a basic phase, wherein the ACFP comprises predominantly the species Ca2+, PO43" and F. The basic phase of ACFP may have the general formula [Ca3(P04)2]x[Ca2(P04)F]y where x Â£ 1 when y = 1 or where y Â£ 1 when x = 1<br>
It is believed that, structurally, the ACP in the PP stabilised ACP complex of the<br><br>
present invention contains a hydroxide anion in place of the fluoride anion in ACFP.<br>
"Phosphopeptide" in the context of the description of this invention means an amino acid sequence in which at least 2 amino acids are phosphoryiated. At least two of the phosphoamino acids in the sequence are preferably contiguous. Preferably the phosphopeptide includes the sequence A-B-C-D-E, where A, B, C, D and E are independently phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, phosphotyrosine, phosphohistidine, glutamic acid or aspartic acid, and at least two, preferably three, of the A, B, C, D and E are phosphoamino acids. In one embodiment, the phosphoamino acid residues are phosphoserine, for example three contiguous phosphoserine residues. In a preferred embodiment, the phosphopeptide includes three contiguous phosphoserine residues followed by two glutamic acid residues in a sequence represented as Ser{P)-Ser(P)-Ser(P)-Glu-GIu (where Ser(P) is phosphoserine and Glu is glutamic acid).<br>
In one embodiment, the PP is a casein phosphopeptide (CPP) which is intact casein or a fragment of casein. Thus, the PP can be a casein phosphoprotein or a polyphosphopeptide. The complex formed may have the formula [CPP(ACP)8]n or [(CPP)(ACFP&gt;8]n where n is equal to or greater than 1, for example 6. The complex formed may be a colloidal complex, where the core particles aggregate to form small (e.g. about 2-5 nm) and large (eg about 100 nm) colloidal particles suspended in water.<br>
The PP may be from any source; it may be present in the context of a larger polypeptide, including a full length casein polypeptide, or it may be isolated by tryptic or other enzymic digestion or by chemical hydrolysis (for example by alkali or acid) of casein or other phosphoamino acid rich proteins such as phosph'rtin, or by chemical or recombinant synthesis, provided that it comprises the sequence A-B-C-D-E, as defined above. The sequence flanking this core sequence may be any sequence. However, those flanking sequences in 0^(59-79) [1], P(l-25) [2], cts2(46-70) [3] and cts2(1-21) [4] are preferred- The flanking sequences may optionally be modified by deletion, addition or conservative substitution of one or more residues. The amino acid composition and sequence of the flanking region<br><br>
are not critical.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the PP is one or more casein phosphopeptides selected from the group consisting of Osi(59-79) [1], p(1-25) [2], as2(46-70) [3] and <xs2></xs2>
Without being bound by any theory or mode of action, it is believed that the PP binds to the ACP or ACFP cluster to produce a metastable complex which exists in solution. This binding is believed to inhibit the growth of ACP or ACFP to a size that initiates nucleation and precipitation of calcium phosphate. In this way, calcium and other ions such as fluoride ions can be localised, for instance at a surface on a tooth to prevent demineralisation and prevent formation of dental caries. It is therefore believed that this provides a mechanism for delivering amorphous calcium phosphate in a bioavailable form that is able to remineralise teeth.<br>
In a further embodiment, the invention provides a stable ACFP complex or a stable ACP complex as described above, which complex acts as a delivery vehicle that co-localises ions including, but not limited to calcium, fluoride and phosphate ions at a target site. In a preferred embodiment, the complex includes calcium phosphate in an amorphous form that produces superior anti-caries anti-erosion/corrosion, anti-calculus and antkJental hypersensitivity efficacy. The target site is preferably teeth or bone.<br>
In a further aspect the present invention provides a phosphopeptide stabilised amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) or amorphous calcium fluoride (ACFP) complex, wherein the complex is formed at a pH of 7.0 or below, and wherein the ACP or ACFP is predominantly in a basic form.<br>
For the avoidance of doubt, the phosphopeptide stabilized ACP or ACFP complexes of the present invention exclude complexes formed at a pH of above 7.0 as described in WO 98/40406.<br>
The complexes are preferably substantially free of ions other than calcium,<br><br>
phosphate, fluoride and hydroxide ions, although they do contain water molecules. The complexes are also preferably formulated with PP such that they are soluble in water. In the context of the present invention, the term "soluble" also includes the situation where the complexes may also be described as being in a colloidal dispersion.<br>
In one embodiment, the ACP complex consists essentially of PP, calcium, phosphate and hydroxide ions and water.<br>
In one embodiment, the ACFP complex consists essentially of PP, calcium, phosphate, fluoride and hydroxide ions and water.<br>
In a further aspect, the invention also provides a method of producing Â« stable complex of ACP as described above, comprising the steps of:<br>
(i)       obtaining a solution comprising at least one phosphopeptide and;<br>
(ii)      admixing solutions comprising calcium ions, phosphate ions and hydroxide ions, while maintaining the pH at about 7.0 or below.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of this aspect of the present invention, the hydroxide ions are titrated into the solution to maintain the phosphopeptide solution at an essentially constant pH. In a further preferred embodiment, the calcium and phosphate ions are titrated into the phosphopeptide solution with constant mixing and at a rate that avoids the formation of a calcium phosphate precipitate in the phosphopeptide solution.<br>
In a further aspect, the invention also provides a method of producing a stable complex of ACFP as described above, comprising the steps of:<br>
(i)      obtaining a solution comprising at least one phosphopeptide and;<br>
(ii)      admixing solutions comprising calcium ions, phosphate ions, hydroxide ions and fluoride ions, while maintaining the pH at about 7.0 or below.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment of this aspect of the present invention, the hydroxide ions are titrated into the solution to maintain the phosphopeptide solution at an essentially constant pK In a further preferred embodiment, the calcium, phosphate and fluoride ions are titrated into the phosphopeptide solution with constant mixing and at a rate that avoids the formation of a calcium phosphate precipitate in the phosphopeptide solution.<br>
The pH may be adjusted by the addition of hydrogen ions (acid) or hydroxide ions (base) as required.<br>
Any physiologically compatible or acceptable acid may be used a source of hydrogen ions that does not attack the complexes themselves. Typically, hydrochloric acid will be used. Any physiologically acceptable base, eg NaOH, may be used as a source of hydroxide ions to adjust the pH and to otherwise supply hydroxide ions as required for the formation of the complex. The exact acids and bases used are not considered critical subject to the above.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, high concentrations of calcium ions and phosphate ions (for example 3 M calcium ions and 1 M phosphate ions) are titrated into the phosphopeptide solution used in the method of producing a stable ACP complex or the method of producing a stable ACFP complex according to the present invention. Preferably, the solutions of calcium ions and phosphate ions are added very slowly in aliquots (for example around 1% volume addition per minute) with thorough mixing. In a preferred embodiment, an aliquot of the phosphate ion solution is added before an aliquot of calcium ion solution. The hydroxide ions are preferably added continually. In a preferred embodiment, the hydroxide ions are added after each calcium ion addition.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention there is provided a method of producing a phosphopeptide stabilised amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) complex comprising the steps of<br>
(i)      obtaining a solution comprising at least one phosphopeptide and;<br><br>
(ii) admixing solutions comprising calcium ions, phosphate ions and hydroxide ions while maintaining the pH at about 7.0 or below.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention there is provided a method of producing a   . phosphopeptide  stabilised   amorphous   calcium  fluoride   phosphate   (ACFP) complex comprising the steps of<br>
(i)      obtaining a solution comprising at least one phosphopeptide and;<br>
(ii) admixing solutions comprising calcium ions, phosphate ions and hydroxide ions while maintaining the pH at about 7.0 or below.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention there is provided a formulation comprising a phosphopeptide stabilized ACP or ACFP complex wherein the pH of the formulation is less than 7.0. In one embodiment, the pH of the formulation is between about pH 5.0 and up to but below pH 7.0. Preferably the pH of the formulation is between about pH 5.0 and about 6.0. In a preferred embodiment, the pH of the formulation is about 5.5.<br>
Thus, the phosphopeptide-stabilized ACP or ACFP complex may be formed at a pH of about 7.0 and below, and then placed in an environment having a different pH, preferably a pH of between 4 and 10. In one embodiment the pH is between 4.5 and 6.5, more preferably between 5 and 6, and most preferably about 5.5.<br>
The complexes of the invention are useful as calcium supplements in subjects in need of stimulation of bone growth, for example subjects undergoing fracture repair, joint replacement, bone grafts, or craniofacial surgery. These complexes are also useful as dietary supplements in subjects who for any reason, such as dietary intolerance, allergy, or religious or cultural factors, are unable or unwilling to consume dairy products in an amount sufficient to supply their dietary calcium requirements.<br>
Embodiments of the invention are described below in which the environment for the complexes may be a formulation for a particular purpose, such as exemplified below. The pH of this environment may be adjusted as set out above for optimal<br><br>
effect, regardless of the pH at which the complex was originally formed, given the stability of the complexes formed.<br>
In one embodiment, there is provided a method for remineralising teeth comprising applying to the teeth a complex as described above, desirably in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The complex may contain ACP, ACFP or both. The method is preferably applied to a subject in need of treatment.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the Invention, the stable ACFP or ACP complex is incorporated into oral compositions such as toothpaste, mouth washes or formulations for the mouth to aid in the prevention and/or treatment of dental caries or tooth decay. The ACFP or ACP complex may comprise 0.01-50% by weight of the composition, preferably 1.0-50%. For oral compositions, it is preferred that the amount of the PP-ACP and/or PP-ACFP administered is 0.01 -50% by weight, preferably 1.0% - 50% by weight of the composition. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the oral composition of the present invention contains about 2% PP-ACP, PP-ACFP or a mixture of both. The oral composition of this invention which contains the above-mentioned agents may be prepared and used in various forms applicable to the mouth such as dentifrice including toothpastes, toothpowders and liquid dentifrices, mouthwashes, troches, chewing gums, dental pastes, gingival massage creams, gargle tablets, dairy products and other foodstuffs. The oral composition according to this invention may further include additional well known ingredients depending on the type and form of a particular oral composition.<br>
In certain preferred forms of the invention the oral composition may be substantially liquid in character, such as a mouthwash or rinse. In such a preparation the vehicle is typically a water-alcohol mixture desirably including a humectant as described below. Generally, the weight ratio of water to alcohol is in the range of from about 1:1 to about 20:1. The total amount of water-alcohol mixture in this type of preparation is typically in the range of from about 70 to about 99.9% by weight of the preparation. The alcohol is typically ethanol or isopropanol. Ethanol is preferred.<br><br>
The pH of such liquid and other preparations of the invention is generally in the range of from about 5 to about 9 and typically from about 5.0 to 7.0. The pH can be controlled with acid (e.g. citric acid or benzoic acid) or base (e.g. sodium hydroxide) or buffered (as with sodium citrate; benzoate, carbonate, or bicarbonate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, sodium dihydrogen phosphate, etc).<br>
In one embodiment, the oral composition according to the present invention has a pH of about 5.5 and contains stable ACP or ACFP.<br>
In other desirable forms of this invention, the oral composition may be substantially solid or pasty in character, such as toothpowder, a dental tablet or a toothpaste (dental cream) or gel dentifrice. The vehicle of such solid or pasty oral preparations generally contains dentally acceptable polishing material. Examples of polishing materials are water-insoluble sodium metaphosphate, potassium metaphosphate, tricalcium phosphate, dihydrated calcium phosphate, anhydrous dicalcium phosphate, calcium pyrophosphate, magnesium orthophosphate, trimagnesium phosphate, calcium carbonate, hydrated alumina, calcined alumina, aluminum silicate, zirconium silicate, silica, bentonite, and mixtures thereof. Other suitable polishing material include the particulate thermosetting resins such as melamine-, phenolic, and urea-formaldehydes, and cross-linked polyepoxides and polyesters. Preferred polishing materials include crystalline silica having particle sizes of up to about 5 microns, a mean particle size of up to about 1.1 microns, and a surface area of up to about 50,000 cm2/g., silica gel or colloidal silica, and complex amorphous alkali metal aluminosilicate.<br>
When visually clear gels are employed, a polishing agent of colloidal silica, such as those sold under the trademark SYLOID as Syloid 72 and Syloid 74 or under the trademark SANTOCEL as Santocel 100, alkali metal aluminosilicate complexes are particularly useful since they have refractive indices close to the refractive indices of gelling agent-liquid (including water and/or humectant) systems commonly used in dentifrices.<br>
Many of the so-called "water insoluble" polishing materials are anionic in character and also include small amounts of soluble material. Thus, insoluble sodium<br><br>
metaphosphate may be formed in any suitable manner, for example as illustrated by Thorpe's Dictionary of Applied Chemistry, Volume 9, 4th Edition, pp. 510-511. The forms of insoluble sodium metaphosphate known as Madrell's salt and Kurrol's salt are further examples of suitable materials. These metaphosphate salts exhibit only a minute solubility in water, and therefore are commonly referred to as insoluble metaphosphates (IMP). There is present therein a minor amount of soluble phosphate material as impurities, usually a few percent such as up to 4% by weight. The amount of soluble phosphate material, which is believed to include a soluble sodium trimetaphosphate in the case of insoluble metaphosphate, may be reduced or eliminated by washing with water if desired. The insoluble alkali metal metaphosphate is typically employed in powder form of a particle size such that no more than 1 % of the material is larger than 37 microns.<br>
The polishing material is generally present in the solid or pasty compositions in weight concentrations of about 10% to about 99%. Preferably, it is present in amounts from about 10% to about 75% in toothpaste, and from about 70% to about 99% in toothpowder. In toothpastes, when the polishing material is silicious in nature, it is generally present in an amount of about 10-30% by weight. Other polishing materials are typically present in amount of about 30-75% by weight.<br>
In a toothpaste, the liquid vehicle may comprise water and humectant typically in an amount ranging from about 10% to about 80% by weight of the preparation. Glycerine, propylene glycol, sorbitol and polypropylene glycol exemplify suitable humectants/carriers. Also advantageous are liquid mixtures of water, glycerine and sorbitol. In clear gels where the refractive index is an important consideration, about 2.5 - 30% w/w of water, 0 to about 70% w/w of glycerine and about 20-80% w/w of sorbitol are preferably employed.<br>
Toothpaste, creams and gels typically contain a natural or synthetic thickener or gelling agent in proportions of about 0.1 to about 10, preferably about 0.5 to about 5% w/w. A suitable thickener is synthetic hectorite, a synthetic colloidal magnesium alkali metal silicate complex clay available for example as Laponite (e.g. CP, SP 2002, D) marketed by Laporte Industries Limited. Laponite D is, approximately by weight 58.00% Si02, 25.40% MgO, 3.05% Na20, 0.98% Li2Ot<br><br>
and some water and trace metals. Its true specific gravity is 2.53 and it has an apparent bulk density of 1.0 g/ml at 8% moisture.<br>
Other suitable thickeners include Irish moss, iota carrageenan, gum tragacanth, starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone, hydroxyethylpropylcellulose, hydroxybutyl methyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose (e.g. available as Natrosol), sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, and colloidal silica such as finely ground Syloid (e.g. 244). Solubilizing agents may also be included such as humectant polyols such propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol and hexylene glycol, cellosolves such as methyl cellosolve and ethyl cellosolve, vegetable oils and waxes containing at least about 12 carbons in a straight chain such as olive oil, castor oil and petrolatum and esters such as amyl acetate, ethyl acetate and benzyl benzoate.<br>
It will be understood that, as is conventional, the oral preparations are to be sold or otherwise distributed in suitable labelled packages. Thus, a jar of mouth rinse will have a label describing it, in substance, as a mouth rinse or mouthwash and having directions for its use; and a toothpaste, cream or gel will usually be in a collapsible tube, typically aluminium, lined lead or plastic, or other squeeze, pump or pressurized dispenser for metering out the contents, having a label describing it, in substance, as a toothpaste, gel or dental cream.<br>
Organic surface-active agents may be used in the compositions of the present invention to achieve increased prophylactic action, assist in achieving thorough and complete dispersion of the active agent throughout the oral cavity, and render the instant compositions more cosmetically acceptable. The organic surface-active material is preferably anionic, non-ionic or ampholytic in nature and preferably does not interact with the active agent It is preferred to employ as the surface-active agent a detersive material which imparts to the composition detersive and foaming properties. Suitable examples of anionic surfactants are water-soluble salts of higher fatty acid monoglyceride monosulfates, such as the sodium salt of the monosulfated monoglyceride of hydrogenated coconut oil fatty acids, higher alkyl sulfates such as sodium lauryt sulfate, alkyl aryl sulfonates such as sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate, higher alkylsulfo-acetates, higher fatty acid esters of<br><br>
1,2-dihydroxy propane sulfonate, and the substantially saturated higher aliphatic acyi amides of lower aliphatic amino carboxylic acid compounds, such as those having 12 to 16 carbons in the fatty acid, alkyl or acyl radicals, and the like. Examples of the last mentioned amides are N-lauroyl sarcosine, and the sodium, potassium, and ethanolamine salts of N-lauroyl, N-myristoyl, or N-palmitoyl sarcosine which should be substantially free from soap or similar higher fatty acid material. The use of these sarconite compounds in the oral compositions of the present invention is particularly advantageous since these materials exhibit a prolonged marked effect in the inhibition of acid formation in the oral cavity due to carbohydrates breakdown in addition to exerting some reduction in the solubility of tooth enamel in acid solutions. Examples of water-soluble non-ionic surfactants suitable for use are condensation products of ethylene oxide with various reactive hydrogen-containing compounds reactive therewith having long hydrophobic chains (e.g. aliphatic chains of about 12 to 20 carbon atoms), which condensation products fethoxamers") contain hydrophilic polyoxyethylene moieties, such as condensation products of poly (ethylene oxide) with fatty acids, fatty alcohols, fatty amides, polyhydric alcohols (e.g. sorbitan monostearate) and polypropyleneoxide (e.g. Pluronic materials).<br>

The invention will now be described with reference to the following, non-limiting examples.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Preparation of CPP-ACFP and CPP-ACP solutions<br>
Stock solutions of 3.25M CaCfe, 1.25 M Na2HP04, 1M NaOH and 1M NaF were added in approximately thirty aliquots toa10-15% w/v tryptjc digest of casein until a final concentration of approximately 78 mM Ca2+, 48 mM phosphate and 12 mM fluoride concentrations were obtained. The solutions were added slowly (that is, less than approximately 1% volume addition per minute). An aliquot of the phosphate solution was added first, followed by an aliquot of the calcium solution. The pH was maintained at 7.0, 6.5, 6.0, 5.5 and 5.0 using the NaOH with thorough mixing. The sodium hydroxide solution was added automatically by a pH stat with the addition of the hydroxide ions usually being after each addition of the calcium ions. After addition of the calcium ions, phosphate ions, hydroxide ions and fluoride ions the solution was filtered through a 0.1 micron filter to concentrate 1-2 fold. The retentate may be washed with water to remove salts and inactive (and. bitter tasting) peptides if desired. CPP-ACP solutions were prepared as above without the addition of fluoride.<br>
At the completion of each titration and filtration a sample of each retentate was taken and less than 10% collected as a filtrate using a 3000 molecular weight cutoff Centriprep 3 ultrafiltration membrane. The Centripreps containing the samples were centrifuged at 1,000 g for 15 min in a Beckman J2-21 centrifuge using a JA 10.5 rotor. The original sample before Centriprep centrifugation and a sample of the filtrate after Centriprep centrifugation were taken for analysis of calcium, phosphate and fluoride concentrations. The analysis of the original sample gave total calcium, phosphate and fluoride ion concentrations and the analysis of the filtrate gave free (unbound) calcium, phosphate and fluoride concentrations. The difference between the total and unbound concentrations Is the bound concentration of Ca, Pi and F by the CPP and that is presented in Table 1 and<br><br>
Table 2.<br>
In a first illustration of an embodiment of the invention, bound calcium, phosphate and fluoride of 2% CPP-ACFP were measured in complexes prepared at acidic pH values, as shown in Table 1.<br><br>
In a second illustration of an embodiment of the invention, bound calcium and phosphate of 2% CPP-ACP were measured in complexes prepared at acidic pH values, as shown in Table 2.<br><br>
The results of this experiment demonstrate that nanocomplexes or nanoclusters of amorphous calcium phosphate and amorphous calcium fluoride phosphate stabilised by casein phosphopeptides (CPP) are formed at acidic pH, as they are retained after the filtration step due to aggregation at high concentrations.   The<br><br>
ratios of bound calcium and phosphate and fluoride of Table 1 and 2 demonstrate that the complexes formed contain basic amorphous calcium phosphate and basic amorphous calcium fluoride phosphate (ACFP). The basic ACP phase was [Ca3(P04)2MCa2(P04)(OH)] where x = 1-2 for all pH values. The basic ACFP phase was [Ca3(P04)*Ix[Ca2(P04)F|y where x = 1 and y = 1-2 (pH 5.0) and where y = 1 and x = 1-2 (pH 5.5 - 7.0). Also, it can be seen that the amount of calcium ions and phosphate ions bound at acidic pH remains relatively high until the pH of formation drops to the region of about 5.0.<br>
It is believed, without being bound by any theory or mode of action, that the formation of the complexes can be achieved at acidic pH by the steady addition of OH anions, such as by NaOH addition, preferably with agitation, such that the OH anions with the calcium ions and phosphate (PO43*) ions form basic ACP sufficiently for it to be stabilised by the CPP, which then drives the reaction to form more ACP upon further OH addition. Moreover, in the case of ACFP, the F permits a lower pH environment for complex formation, and it can be seen from Table 1 that a greater amount of calcium is bound in ACFP complexes at a given acidic pH than ACP at the same pH.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Comparison of remineralization of enamel subsurface lesions in vitro by CPP-ACP and CPP-ACFP at acidic pH values<br>
The polished enamel surface of extracted human third molars were sawn as a slab (8x4mm2) and covered with acid resistant nail varnish to form an occlusal-half and a gingival-half mesiodistal window (1x7mm2) separated by 1mm. The protocol used for the comparison was that described in Reynolds (1997) Remineralization of enamel subsurface lesions by casein phosphopeptide-stabilized calcium phosphate solutions. J Dent Res 76:1587-1595, which is known to one skilled in the art, and the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. Subsurface enamel lesions were created on these windows using the Carbopol method of White (described Reynolds, 1997). The enamel slabs were sawn in half to 4x4mm2 blocks. The gingival-half lesion on one block and the occlusal-half lesion on the other block were sealed with varnish to create the demineralized<br><br>
controls.<br>
The enamel half-lesions were exposed to the different remineralization solutions for 10 days at 37Â°C without mixing. The remineralization solutions were 2% CPP-ACP or 2% CPP-ACFP prepared at pH 7.0,6.5,6.0, 5.5 and 5.0 and maintained in solutions having the respective pH of formation.<br>
After remineralization each pair of blocks was dehydrated in ethanol and embedded in methyl-methacrylate resin (Paladur, Kulzer, Germany). Three 200-300^m sections were cut perpendicular to the lesion surface, lapped down to 80 Â± 5\im and radiographed beside an aluminium stepwedge of 10x14j*m thick increments as described previously (Shen et a/M 2001, J. Dent Res. 80:2066-2070), the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Radiographic images of the lesions were viewed via transmitted light through a Dilux 22 microscope (Ernst Leitz Wetzlar, Germany). The images were acquired by video camera (Sony DXC 930P) and digitized (Scion imaging corporation, colour grabber 7) under the control of imaging software (Optimas 6.2). Images of the lesions, controls and the aluminium stepwedge were scanned as previously described by Shen et ai (2001). The enamel section thickness was measured and volume percentage mineral data determined using the equation of Angmar (1963) as previously described by Shen et ai (2001). The percentage remineralization (%R) was also calculated as previously described by Shen et ai (2001).<br>
The remineralization of the enamel subsurface lesions by these solutions is shown in Table 3.<br><br><br><br>
The results of Table 3 demonstrate that 2% CPP-ACP and CPP-ACFP solutions remineralise enamel subsurface lesions at substantial levels, notwithstanding the acidic pH values. Both CPP-ACP and CPP-ACFP produced optimal remineralization at pH 5.5. Even at pH 5.0 where normally enamel demineralization would otherwise occur, 2% CPP-ACP produced 18% remineralization and 2% CPP-ACFP produced 40% remineralization demonstrating the superior properties of CPP-ACFP in acidic solutions.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Comparison of enamel remineralisation in situ by CPP-ACP at pH 7.0 and 5.5<br>
This study was a double-blind and crossover design to assess the ability of a mouthrinse containing 0.5% w/v CPP-ACP prepared and maintained at pH 5.5 compared with a mouthrinse containing 0.5% w/v CPP-ACP prepared and maintained at pH 7.0 to enhance enamel remineralization in an intraoral model. Approval for the study was obtained from The University of Melbourne Human Research Ethics Committee and the Royal Dental Hospital of Melbourne Ethics in Clinical Research Committee. Four healthy adult subjects (2 males and 2 females) were recruited from the staff and postgraduate students (age 21 to 47 years) of the School of Dental Science. All subjects had at least 22 natural teeth with no current caries activity, periodontal disease or other oral pathology. None of the subjects were using antibiotics or medications, which could have affected salivary flow rate. The unstimulated salivary flow rate of each subject was in excess of 0.2 ml/min. Unstimulated salivary flow rates were measured by instructing the subjects to lean forward with their heads tilted downwards, allowing saliva to flow into a pre-weighed centrifuge tube for exactly 2 min. Stimulated salivary flow rates were measured by instructing the subjects to consume sugar-free chewing gum for exactly 2 min while allowing all saliva produced to flow into a pre-weighed centrifuge tube.<br><br>
Removable mid-palatal acrylic appliances covering the first premolars to the last tooth in the arch were fabricated for each subject as described previously (Shen et a/., 2001).<br>
Extracted human third molars were obtained from the Royal Dental Hospital of Melbourne. Any extracted soft tissues were removed and the teeth were stored in an 18% v/v formalin acetate solution. Sound, relatively planar buccal and lingual surfaces free of cracks, stains and fluorosis (as viewed under a dissecting microscope) were selected and thrice rinsed with Milli-Q water. The outer enamel surface was removed and polished wet to a mirror finish using Soflexâ„¢ (3M) discs on a slow speed contra-angle dental handpiece. Each polished surface was then sawn from the tooth as an approximately 8x4 mm slab, using a water-cooled diamond blade saw and the whole slab covered with acid-resistant nail varnish except for two (occlusal and gingival) mesiodistal windows (1x7 mm) separated from each other by 1 mm. Lesions were created in the enamel windows by mounting each slab onto the end of a 3 - 4 cm stick of yellow dental sticky wax and immersing in 40 ml of unagitated demineralization buffer, consisting of 20 g/l Carbopol 907â„¢ (carboxypolymethylene, BF Goodrich, Cleveland, OH), 500 mg/l hydroxyapatite (Bio-GelÂ® HTP, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, CL), and 0.1 mol/l lactic acid (Ajax Chemicals, Auburn, NSW) pH 4.8, for 4 days at 37Â°C. A change of solution was made after 2 days at which time the slabs were removed from the solution, rinsed thrice with Milli-Q water, blotted dry and placed into fresh demineralization buffer. The slabs were similarly rinsed and dried after four days of demineralization. This demineralization procedure produced consistent subsurface lesions of approximately 80-100 jun depths (LDd) with intact surface layers, as evaluated by microradiography of sections of the artificial lesions. After demineralization each enamel slab was sawn through the midline of each window into two 4x4 mm half-slabs and the cut surface of each half-slab covered with nail varnish. One half-slab of each pair was retained as the demineralization control and stored in a labelled 15 ml microcentrifuge tube together with a drop of Milli-Q water, thereby creating a humidified environment. The other enamel half-slab of the pair was inset into an intraoral appliance and retained using dental wax for the remineralization protocol.   Care was taken to keep the windows free of<br><br>
wax. Four enamel half-slabs were inset into each appliance, two on each side in bilateral troughs (Shen et a/., 2001).<br>
The test mouthrinses contained 0.5% w/v CPP-ACP prepared as described in Example 1 at pH 5.5 or pH 7.0. The products were provided as coded products. The code was not released until all the data had been acquired. This study utilized a double blind, cross-over design with two treatments: (i) a mouthrinse containing 0.5% (w/v) CPP-ACP at pH 7.0, and (ii) a mouthrinse containing 0.5% (w/v) CPP-ACP at pH 5.5. Subjects were randomly assigned to each of the mouthrinses.<br>
At the commencement of the study all subjects were provided with an adequate supply of a standard fluoride dentifrice which they were instructed to use for the duration of the study. Subjects were instructed to brush their teeth with a fluoride dentifrice early morning and bedtime. They were also instructed to rinse their mouths with water before insertion of the intra-oral appliance. Subjects wore removable palatal appliances with four human-enamel half-slabs inset containing subsurface demineralized lesions. Each subject was instructed to rinse with 5 ml of mouthrinse for 60 seconds as soon as the appliance was inserted into the mouth. The subjects continued to wear the appliance for another 40 minutes. This was done 4 times a day for 10 consecutive days at the following times: 10:00 am; 11:30 am; 2:00 pm and 3.30 pm. While the appliance was being worn, the subjects were instructed not to eat or drink anything. Following the 10 day testing period, there was a one-week washout period. The subjects then crossed over to the other treatments. When the appliance was removed from the mouth, it was briefly rinsed with Milli-Q water and kept in a sealed moist plastic bag and stored in at room temperature. Subjects were informed not to brush the area containing the enamel blocks. Subjects kept a diary of product use and appliance wearing times. No alterations were made to the subjects' diet or oral hygiene procedures for the duration of the study. After each treatment period the enamel half-slabs were removed, paired with their respective demineralized control enamel half-slabs, embedded, sectioned and subjected to microradiography and computer-assisted densitometric image analysis to determine the level of remineralization.<br><br>
After each treatment, the enamel half-slabs were paired with their respective control half-slabs and then dehydrated in absolute alcohol. Each pair of half-slabs was embedded, sectioned and subjected to microradiography and computer-assisted densitometric analysis as described by Shen ef a/.(2001). Radiographic images of the lesions and the neighbouring areas of sound enamel were scanned using the program's line luminance function that gives readings in gray values between 0 and 256. Each lesion was scanned six times through an area free of artefacts or cracks. Each scan comprised 200 readings taken from the tooth surface through the lesion to sound enamel. An aluminium stepwedge image on each slide was scanned and the averaged step grey value readings were plotted against aluminium thickness. The readings of the tooth section image lay within the linear portion of the stepwedge curve and linear regression was used to convert the grey value data into values of equivalent thickness of aluminium. The section thickness was measured and the vol% mineral data computed using the equation of Angmar ef a/. (1963) and the linear absorption coefficients of aluminium, organic matter plus water and apatitic mineral (131.5, 11.3 and 260.5 respectively). The image of the median strip between the two lesions was scanned six times and averaged to give a control densitometric profile of sound enamel. The lesion images (treated windows and demineralization control windows) to the gingival and occlusal side of the median strip were similarly scanned, as close as possible to the median strip but avoiding any irregularities commonly found at the lesion edges, and the % mineral profiles were computed.<br>
The vol% mineral profile of each enamel half-slabs demineralized and treated lesion was compared with the median sound enamel vol% mineral profile of the same section. The difference between the areas under the densitometric profile of the demineralized control lesion and the median sound enamel, calculated by trapezoidal integration, is represented by AZd. The difference between the areas under the densitometric profile of the treated lesion and the median sound enamel, calculated by trapezoidal integration, is represented by AZr. These parameters were then converted to % change values after treatment, as such, % mineral change (%MC) represents the % change in AZ values:<br><br><br>
Data for the three treatments was statistically tested using analysis of variance (ANOVA) for a randomized complete block design (Norusis M.1993). Homogeneity of variance was confirmed using Levene's test and normality of the data was confirmed using normal probability plots and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 11.0 software (Norusis M.1993).<br>
On obtaining the complete data set of enamel remineralization values the code was released and the decoded data was analyzed. The results in Table 4 represent the mean %MC values for the 4 subjects and the data for each subject obtained from 12 scans (6 each from the gingival and occlusal lesions) performed on each section from the four enamel half-slabs in each appliance. Use of the mouthrinse containing 0.5% (w/v) CPP-ACP at pH 5.5 produced 14.16 Â± 1.90% remineralization of the enamel subsurface lesions whereas use of the mouthrinse containing 0.5% (w/v) CPP-ACP at pH 7.0 resulted in only 10.31 Â± 2.28% enamel subsurface remineralization. This difference was statistically significant (p
