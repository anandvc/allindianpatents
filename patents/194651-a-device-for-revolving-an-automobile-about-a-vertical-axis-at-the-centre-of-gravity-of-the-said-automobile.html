				<td>The invention relates to a device for revolving an automobile about a vertical axis. This device is operable only when the vehicle is stationary.<br>
At present, all automobiles can steer left or right up to a certain angle by steering the front wheels. There are special vehicles made experimentally where all the four wheels can be steered to obtain a tighter turning circle.<br>
But upto date, no vehicle has been produced which can rotate about its axis 360° while stationary.<br>
This facility of revolving about its axis is advantageous when the road is very narrow or the vehicle is caught in a conjested traffic.<br>
Thus, the main object of the present invention is to produce a device which can be used for revolving a vehicle at any angle upto 360° while it is stationary.<br>
According to this invention,, there is provided a device for revolving an automobile around a vertical axis at the centre of gravity of the said automobile having a hydro/pneumatic compressor connected to the engine of the automobile, said compressor supplying pneumatic air to the device, the device comprising a revolving means constituting of a first base plate mounted ptvotably at bottom of the automobile through a hydraulic jack and two pairs of wheels rotatably mounted on to said base plate at 90° to each other, said jack being connected to a compressed air supply line and the revolving means such that the automobile can be rotated around a crank pin and a bearing connected to a piston and a cylinder of trie engine via a crank pin and a piston rod.<br>
2<br><br>
The nature of the invention, its objectives and further advantages residing in the same will be apparent from the ensuing description made with references to non-limiting exemplary embodiments of the invention represented in the accompanying drawings:<br>

The jack shows is of four section type and is mounted on to a base plate (11), The base plate (11) is mounted on the bottom of the automobile floor plate through a crank pin (13) and bearing (12). Two pairs of wheels (23,24) are mounted at the base plate (11) at 90° to each other. The wheels (23,24) alongwith the base plate (11) retracts and the jack (10) expands and is supported on the ground and lifts the automobile for rotation.<br>
Fig.3 shows the arrangement of power rotation of the automobile after it is lifted from the ground as described above.<br>
The system consists of a cylinder (20) and piston (19). The cylinder (20) is connected to a compressed air supply. The connecting rod (19) of the piston (19) is connected to a crank pin (16) to which is connected a connecting rod (19). At the<br><br>
^<br><br>
- 4 -<br><br>
other end of the connectinq rod (19) is a crank pin (15), and a connecting rod (14) connects to the central crank pin (13), When the piston (19) moves to and fro in the cylinder (20), the revolving base plate (11) rotates about the bearing (12). The amount of rotation of the base plate (11) with the automobile can be controlled.<br>
Fig.1 shows the power supply arrangement. The compressor (2) is connected to the engine (1 ) through chain pulley (3) arrangement. There are two reservoirs (4,5) which are provided with governor (6), pressure limiting valve (7) and safety valve (8) and a brake valve (9) supplies compressed air to hydraulic jack (10) and hydraulic revolving base plate (11).<br>
In another embodiment as shown in Fig.4 where the hydraulic jack (25) is rotatably mounted on to a base plate fixed onto the bottom of the automobile. The hydraulic jack (25) is mounted at the centre of gravity of the vehicle so that it can lift and support and at the same time rotate. The rotation of the automobile after being lifted is with a similar arrangement as in Fig.3.<br>
In a third embodiment, shows a four section jack which consists of a central close ended cylinder (27) with a tension spring (28). An air supply (31) is connected to the cylinder (27) which an air pressure expands against the tension spring alongwith the four sections of the jack.<br>
The hydraulic jack (27) is mounted on to a base plate (29). The base plate (29) is fixed to the bottom of the automobile. The bevel gear (30) is fixed on to the base plate (29) and bevel pinion (32) is engaged to the bevel gear (30) is rotatably connected to the engine (1) through the pulley system (33).<br>
