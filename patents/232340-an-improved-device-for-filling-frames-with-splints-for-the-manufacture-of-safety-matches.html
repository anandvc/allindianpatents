				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a no inproved device for filling frames with splints for the manufacture of safety matches. The present invention particularly relates to a device for organizing random mix of splints in such a manner that one frame containing holes in a matrix of 60 rows or more and 52 columns or more, can be filled up with splints at the rate of approximately 2 or more frames per minute. The device of the present invention will be particularly useful for low cost match manufacturing units.<br>
The machine will be used in the manufacture of match sticks, particularly, for fixing the splints in a frame. The splints attached to the frame are then to be dipped into a chemical bath to produce the matches.<br>
The prior art search covering literature, patents and industrial survey reveals the following technologies for manufacture of matches:<br>
1. Automatic plant/machines - Large automatic machines made in Japan, Germany and Sweden are available for a production rate of approximately 2 million splints per hour. The matches are produced automatically and continuously on such machines which normally consist of continuous roller chain, splints charging device, preheater and reheater, paraffining device, chemical dipping device and matches discharging device. The splints are fed pneumatically from a bunker, and distributed equally into a magazine box which brings the splints well arranged to the splints charging device. A predetermined quantity of splints are charged into the chain bar at each stroke. There are more than 2000 pieces of bar each containing about 800 holes thereby ensuring a production rate of approximately 2 million matches per<br>
hour. These machines are very costly and require a very large space for installation.<br>
2. Cottage Industry - Matches are also produced in cottage industry using completely manual process. The ready made splints are inserted into holes one by one manually and in this manner each frame containing 52 columns and 60 rows of holes is filled up in about 60 minutes. Subsequently, the frame is held and dipped in chemical bath manually for applying combustible composition onto the splints. It takes about 60 minutes to fill up a frame with 3120 splints.<br>
From the above noted prior art details, it is found that there is no low cost automatic machine which can fill frames with splints in the manner as described herein. The machine of the present invention is a low cost, semi automatic compact machine consisting of novel features such as oscillating table feeder, vibrating hopper and oscillating guide to remove broken splints, if any. This machine is ideally suited to small scale entrepreneurs for its low cost and simple operation.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a novel device for filling frames with splints for the manufacture of safety matches.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide suitable device/machine for a cottage or a small scale industry to achieve frame filling at much more enhanced rate, approximately 2 frames per minute or more.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a mechanized method of frame filling with a higher output rate so that manual labour is reduced, along with the associated error.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide low cost automation appropriate for a cottage/small scale industry so that production cost of safety match boxes is reduced.<br>
In the drawings accompanying this specification the invention has been described as follows:<br>

Referred to Fig. 3<br>
The splint feed box consists of an oscillating bottom (1) provided with a rocking motion within the feed box (2) manually filled with splints before starting the machine. The rocking motion is given by an eccentric mounted on a rotating shaft. The splints are guided through the grooves existing on the bottom surface and chute (2a) to the vibrating hopper (3) so that they fall into the hopper in proper orientation.<br>
Referred to Fig. 3<br>
The vibratory motion of the hopper (3) is provided by another eccentric, oscillating follower and suitable linkage mechanism. The vibratory hopper (3) is specially designed so that the splints get arranged in proper orientation and fall easily into the fixed guiding block (4) placed directly below the vibrating hopper.<br>
Referred to Fig. 3<br>
The pusher block fitted with a comb(5) is given the reciprocating motion by a slider crank mechanism (6). The comb pusher pushes the splints, during its forward motion through a fixed guiding block (4) into the frame (7) provided with holes in 60 rows and 52 columns, each row and column are separated by a fixed distance (8 mm). The splints shall be pushed into the frame such that about 3/4th of their length are protruded in front of the frame .<br>
Referred to Figs. 4a &amp; 4b<br>
Once the top most line of holes in the frame (7) are filled up, the frame carrier (8) holding the said frame is given an upward movement by a distance equal to the pitch distance between two rows of holes to position the frame (7) in correct location. This motion is repeated after each row<br>
of holes is filled up with splints until the bottom most line of holes is filled up. The machine will be automatically stopped by a limit switch (9) at this position of the frame carrier (8). This feeding motion of the frame carrier (8) is provided by rack and pinion arrangement (10). The pinion is given an intermittent rotary movement (referred to Fig.5a) by a pawl and ratchet indexing mechanism (11) being driven by an adjustable eccentric mounted on the pusher shaft.<br>
During the process of inserting the splints within the frame, some splints may be broken or there may already exist some broken pieces in the lot. An oscillating guide (12) has been provided to remove these broken pieces from the path of pusher movement so that no obstruction is caused by them in the insertion of the splints of proper size. The oscillating guide (12) gets its oscillating motion by means of a specially designed plate cam mounted on a cam shaft which is driven by timer belt and pulley from the pusher shaft.<br>
Referred to Fig. 6<br>
All the movements to different mechanisms as stated above are provided by a single gear motor (13). The output rotation of the gear box is transmitted to the main drive shaft (14) through a v-belt arrangement (15). The main drive shaft transmits motion to other shafts by timer belt pulley (16) arrangements.<br>
After completion of filling of one frame, the same shall be removed from top and a new one shall be placed at the bottommost position to start the filling operation once again.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an improved device for filling frames with splints for the manufacture of safety matches characterized by a splint feed box (2) having a vertically oscillating multi grooved bottom (1) for channelising splints(S) through a chute(2a) into a vibrating hopper(3), the said hopper being provided below it with a fixed horizontal multi-channel splint guide block(4) so as to enable a multi-fingered comb(5) to push the unidirectionally aligned splints(S) into a vertically placed intermittently movable splint holding frame(7) which is removably fixed on to a frame carrier (8), the said oscillating bottom(l), vibrating hopper(3), comb(5) and splint holding frame(7) being connected and powdered by drive shafts (14,17,18,19), a slider crank(6) being connected to the said comb(5) , a rack-pinion(10), pawl and ratchet(11) being connected to the said splint holding frame(7), the said slider crank being connected to prime mover(13) through belts &amp; pulleys(15,16).<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the oscillating bottom (1) of feed box (2) being provided with plurality of guiding grooves, front openings and chute (2a) to feed the randomly distributed splints (S) in an unidirectional orientation into the vibrating hopper (3).<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, an oscillating guide (12) being provided in front of the fixed guide (4) in order to facilitate removal of the broken splints, if any from the path of the comb pusher(5).<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the splint holding frame (7) is provided with means for activating a limit switch (9).<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the frame feeding/linear indexing movement of the frame carrier (8) being provided<br>
by a pawl and ratchet mechanism (11) and synchronized with the reciprocating motion of the pusher through an adjustable eccentric drive mounted on the same drive shaft which also provides motion to the pusher through a slider crank mechanism (6).<br>
The geared motor (13) drives the main drive shaft (14) by V-belts and pulleys (15). The main drive shaft (13) in turn drives other shafts namely pusher shaft (17), feed shaft (18) and cam shaft (19) through timer belts and pulleys (16). The pusher shaft transmits reciprocating motion to a sliding block fitted with a comb (5) type pusher by means of a standard slider crank mechanism (6). The feed shaft transmits oscillating motion to the feeding table (1) by means of an eccentric and link mechanism. The cam shaft has a plate cam mounted on it which provides oscillating movement to the guide block hinged between centres.<br>
The vibrating hopper (3), positioned just above the fixed guiding block (4) facilitates the smooth feeding of the splints from the hopper to the fixed guiding block (4). The stock of splints randomly oriented is fed onto the oscillating bottom (1) hinged within a feed box (2) provided with a chute (2a) through which the splints are discharged in proper orientation into the vibrating hopper (3). The vibratory motion is transmitted in both longitudinal and vertical directions to the hopper by means of an eccentric and suitable link mechanism. The said eccentric is mounted on a shaft placed at 90° cross angle and driven from the pusher shaft through a pair of bevel gears. The oscillating guide (12) hinged onto the frame is placed in front of the fixed guide (4). The broken splints, if any, fall to the ground during its downward movement. In the upward position, the oscillating guide (12) acts as an extension of the fixed guide (4). The portable frame (7) into which the splints arc to be partially inserted is<br>
provided with plurality of holes arranged in plurality of rows and columns to hold plurality of splints (S). The frame (7) is held in a frame carrier (8) which is given incremental movements vertically by a rack and pinion  (10) which  is rotated  intermittently by a pawl  and ratchet mechanism (11). The input motion is provided by an adjustable eccentric mounted on the pusher shaft. Thus all the motions are synchronized in a manner that the splints are inserted into each row of holes of the frame (7) during each rotation of the main drive shaft (14). When all the rows are filled up, the machine will automatically stop as the frame carrier (8) hits a limit switch (9). The filled frame (7) is removed and a new frame (7) is inserted into the frame carrier (8) which is then placed in the bottommost position. The motor is switched on again to start the next cycle.<br>
The machine of the present invention is new as there is no such machine existing which is useful for filling frames with splints in the manner as described herein. The novelty resides in the specific manner in which it is constructed to provide the desired output of frame filling, an operation essentially required prior to dipping them together in a chemical bath. The inventive steps reside in the oscillating bottom of the feed box and the oscillating guide which are the two mechanisms which facilitate unique feeding of the splints in correct orientation into the vibrating hopper and removal of broken splints, if any, from the path of the comb pusher respectively. These two mechanisms are identified as the non-obvious inventive steps in the machine of the present invention.<br>
The following example is given by way of illustration of the present invention and should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
The machine of the present invention in the form of a scaled down model was used to fill up an aluminium frame of size 300 mm x 300 mm provided with taper holes arranged 8 mm apart in 10 rows and 10 columns, with splints. The model was provided with a reciprocating pusher, vibrating hopper and a frame for carrier. The model was powered manually. The performance of the model was checked for vibratory feeding of the splints and their insertion into the frame and it was found satisfactory.<br>
The main advantages of the present invention are :<br>
1.	Mechanized  method of filling up the  frames with  splints  thus<br>
eliminating the drudgery monotony and extremely low productivity<br>
associated with the manual process.<br>
2.	Simple Operations - even an unskilled operator with little training can<br>
operate the machine.<br>
3.	The machine consists of simple mechanism making it highly reliable<br>
and easily maintainable.<br>
4.	Synchronization of movements is achieved mechanically from a<br>
single motor using simple cams, eccentrics and linkages resulting in<br>
reliability and consistency of performance.<br>
5.	The machine is of modular construction facilitating easy assembly<br>
and dismantling.<br>
6.	The machine provides low cost semi automation to achieve optimum<br>
productivity at a reasonable cost.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
