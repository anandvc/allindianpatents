				<td>2 Description<br>
The invention pertains to a cop preparing device of a bobbin winding machine according to the features of the invention.<br>
When cops have been finish-wound at a frame (ring) spinning machine, the yarn end is, as a rule, fixed upto the foot of the tube with the help of a reserve (backup) winding, before the spinning cops are doffed. At the bobbin winding machine the thread-end fixed till the foot of the tube is not reachable to the gripping tube leading towards a delivery (feeding) bobbin sided thread end of a thread connecting equipment, which collects he thread-end of a newly changed-in cop for starting of the spinning.<br>
On this ground a so-called preparing device is provided with at the bobbin winding machines, in each case. At: it the reserve (back-up) winding is released from the cop-end, as a rule, the thread end is deposited as top winding in a few windings on the top of the tube. From there it is blown off to the winding head and is sucked-in and seized by the gripping tube. The deposit of the thread end is also possible at each other defined positions of the cop, for example, in the inside of the tube or at the circumferential surface of the yarn package. A preparing device with deposit of the yarn as top winding is known from the DE 44 24 462 Al. The cop to be prepared is positioned at the suction means near a suction pipe, which shows a slit at the side turned towards the spinning cop for suction and reception of the thread-end till the deposit on the top (lace) of the tube.<br>
A shut-off device, is arranged in the suction pipe for switching on and switching off the suction air. The suction flow through the slit (slot) of the suction pipe operates (functions) from suction of the thread end till the point of time, where the thread-end is wound-on on the top (lace) of the tube.<br><br>
3<br>
A shut-off device, is attached in the suction pipe for switching on and switching off of the suction air. The suction flow through the slot of the suction pipe function from suction of the thread end till the point of time, where the thread end is wound on the top of the tube. The vacuum must be so large, that the tread and is detached from the cop and is sucked-in in the sucked-in in the suction pipe. That can, for example, be difficult for stiff flax yarns. On the other hand, in case of the sensitive yarns the yarn should not be unraveled (to separate into fibers). During winding of the top (upper) winding the thread should not held too slack (loose), so that the thread windings hold on the top (lace) of the tube.<br>
It is the task of the present invention, to improve upon the suction means at the preparing device for cops.<br>
The solution of the problem takes place with the help of the distinguishing features of the invention.<br>
The invention renders it possible, not only to engage and disengage the vacuum, but also to control in respect of its force on the basis of the feeds the respective requirements accordingly. In case of hairy, fine yarns the suction flow can be adjusted in such a manner that the vacuum is lower than in case of smooth, coarse yarns. The suction flow can, for example, be stronger in the framework of the feed through the yarn parameter during sucking-in (drawing-in) of the thread-end during the unwinding than during winding of the top winding. The thread end is deposited always, according to the invention, as top winding in such a manner, that it can be blown-off from the tube at the winding head of the bobbin winding machine under constant (remaining same) conditions and can be drawn-in through the gripping tube. Thereby the repeat tests for detachment of the top (upper) winding are extensively avoided. The deposit of the thread end at other definite positions of the copy is similarly possible, when the thread-end is employed (installed) with a matching thread tension.<br><br>
4<br>
The control of the vacuum takes place in a simple manner through an adjustable diaphragm.<br>
As actuator of the shutter, the stepping motor is advantageously suitable. Since these motors rotate in pre-settable angular pitch these can be stopped at any number of angular pitches and thereby in any desired position. Thereby it is possible to adjust each desired orifice cross-section and thereby the corresponding vacuum at the shut off device. Electro-motors with a highly reducing gear unit is suitable similarly advantageously towards actuation of the diaphragm. Through the number of the rotation of the drive shaft of the gear unit the position of the diaphragm is preset. The motors mentioned render possible an individual adjustment of the shutter in case of changing result of cops with different yarns, which is, for example, the case in case of a multi-batch seizure.<br>
The search (selection) of an actuator of the diaphragm (blend), especially of the motors, can take place through a controlling device, in which the yarn parameters related to a batch and the processing-course assigned for stacking of the thread-end are stored. In case of a change of a batch, new, with the subsequent batches synchronized data are read or called from a store (memory). An identification of the cops according to the relation ship to a yarn batch is advantageous. A reading means at the preparing device reads the identification and guides the data at the control device further, which adjusts thereupon the assigned (allocated) position of the shutter (blend) in the shut off device and thereby the optimal vacuum in each case. In the control fine the orifice positions assigned to the yarn parameters for this purpose are stored-in. The data of the opening positions can be stipulated, for example, on the basis of the experiments and experience. The identification of the cops can be read, for example, from a data carrier (storage medium), which is assigned to the cops to be processed, in<br><br>
5<br>
each case. Each other identification of the cops, for example, through mechanically or optically analysing (scannable) marking is similarly possible. Especially in case of a multi batch deposition with chaning effect of cops of various batches at the preparing equipment is automatically assigned (allocated) to each cop of its batch association with the corresponding vacuum. As actuator of the diaphragm, a motor driven can disk is also suitable. A can and its drive are simple in the construction. In case of a cam the sequence of the positions of the diaphragm lies rigidly. Through the profiling (moulding) of the cam it is possible to pre-set any effect of positions of the diaphragm (shutter). Through a varying quick drive of the cam it is possible to vary the lapse of time of the positions of the diaphragm.<br>
The cops are delivered to the preparing equipment as a rule on transport disc standing vertically. Thereby a simple handling and good accessibility of the cops is guaranteed. A preparation of the cops in a lying position is, however, conceivable, in the process of which the support (bearing) of the cops, for example, can take place at the laces (tips).<br>
The invention is explained in details with the help of the following accompanying figures:<br>
Fig. 1 a cop in the preparing device during the unwinding of the thread, Fig. 2 view of the opened housing of the shut off means at opened diaphragm, Fig. 3 at closed diaphragm, Fig. 4 at particularly closed diaphragm and<br>
Fig. 5 a view of a opened shutting off means with a cam as actuator of the diaphragm (shutter).<br>
In the Fig. 1 there stands a cop 2 at the preparing device 1, in case which the thread end 3 has already been sucked-in towards depositing as top (upper) winding on the top (tip) of the tube 4 already in the suction device 5. The cop 2 stands on a spindle 6 of a transport disc 7. The transport disc 7 lies on a conveyor belt 8 of a transporting device 9. Towards guiding of the transport disc<br><br>
6<br>
7 to the transport equipment 9 the conveyor belt 8 is surrounded (encircled) at its longitudinal side by a guiding channel 10, which helps the guiding of the transport disc 7. At the processing equipment 1 the guiding channel 10 shows orificesll and 12 lying opposite. Through these orifice 11 and 12 drive-medium for rotation of the transport disc 7 can pass through with the cop 2. At the right side there lie two driving pulleys 13 and 13' one after another seen in the view direction, from which the driving pulley 13' is covered by the driving pulley 13. From the opposite side exactly is arranged concentrically between both the driving pulleys 13 and 13', a tensions (billy) roller 14 pressed against the transport disc 7, in order to center it and to guarantee a good frictional contact with the driving pulleys 13 and 13'. The driving pulleys 13 and 13' as well as a motor 15 are arranged together on a plate 16. The pivoted (rotary supported ) driving pulleys 13 and 13' are rigidly jointed with cams 17 and 17. A belt (strap) is laid around a cam 19 of the motor 15 as well as both the cams 17 and 17' of the driving pulleys 13 and 13', so that a synchronous drive of both the driving pulleys is guaranteed. The motor 15 is jointed through a control line 20with a control switch 21, through which both the rotating direction as well as the number of the rotations, in each case, are precisely controllable. This control switch can belong to the bobbin winding machine for controlling equipment, which is assigned to the preparing equipment.<br>
The plate 15 with cop drive can, as it is not represented here in detail and described, be delivered in the arrow head direction 22 of the transport disc 7. The devices required for this purpose are known from DE 4424 462 Al. Similarly the tension roller 14 can with the help of a medium not represented and described here, which can equally be comparable with the media known from the DE 44 21 462 Al, be delivered in the arrow head direction 23. If the cop 2 has taken the position shown in the preparing device 1, the driving pulleys 13 and 13' as well as the tension roller (pressure-pulley) 14 are delivered according to the arrow head 22 rather 23 and the cop is rotated in the arrow-<br><br>
7<br>
head direction, in the unwinding direction. Simultaneously the identification mark stored in the chip 24, which gives an information on the batch and thereby on the yarn parameter, is read-out from a reading device 25 and fed through the electrical lead 26 of the control unit 21. The reading means 25 is arranged in an orifice 27 in the guide channel 10and in the machine frame 28. The suction device 5 consists of a pipe line 29 closed (sealed) at its end, which ends shortly above the transport device 9 and stretches itself upto above the tip (top) of the tube 4. It is connected with a vacuum source, not represented here. The pipe line 29 shows a slot 29' which reaches out from the end of the pipe line till above the tip of the tube 4 and lies precisely opposite to the positioned cop 2. The suction device 5 lying opposite on the other side of the transport device 9, there stands a device 30 for winding of the top winding. A centering flap 32 as well as a fender 33 are arranged in swingable manner on a holder 31. They can for example, be actuated, through pneumatic cylinder 34 and 35, which are controllable by the controlling unit 21. The fender 33 guides the thread 3 during the winding of the upper winding to the top of the tube 4, whereas the centering flap 32 centers the cop 2. In the DE 44 24 462 Al such a device 30 for winding of a top winding is represented in details and explained. In fig. 1 the situation is represented, that the end of the thread 3 has already been drawn-in in the pipe line 29. The presence of the thread 3 is registered through a sensor 36. In the present form of execution the thread 3 interrupts or weakens a light ray 38 sent by a light sender 37, which is registered by a receiver 39 and is fed through the signal line 40 to the controlling unit 21. The thread sensor 36 lies directly before the shut-off device 41. A shut off device 41 consists of a housing 42, which encircles the pipe line 29. The housing 42 contains an aperture 43, which can close the orifice 44 of the pipe line connecting to the housing 42 in the direction of the vacuum source, can close partially or open fully. Seen in the direction of the suction flow 60 before the shutter (aperture) 43 a scissor for cutting of the thread is arranged. Whereas a<br><br>
8<br>
blade of shears of the scissor 45 stands rigidly before orifice 44, the other shears blade with the aperture 43 is arranged on a common shaft 46. On the shaft toothed segment 47 is attached, in which a pinion 48 grips-in, which sits on the shaft 49 on the motor 50. This motor 50 is the actuator of the shutter 43. In the present form of execution it is a stepping motor and is controlled through the control cable trailing 51 by the controller 21 in such a manner, that aperture 43 can close (shut) the orifice 44 in each pre-set covering (overlapping). In the Figures 2 to 4 the opened housing 42 of the shut-off device 41 is represented. In the individual figures the diaphragm 43 takes different positions. In all the three figures the observer looks in the direction of the orifice 44. The motor 50 has been left out for reasons of facility of inspection. In the housing 42 the pinion 48 arranged on the motor shaft 49 is to be seen at the first, which stays in contact with the toothed segmental disk 47. This toothed segmental disk rotates the shaft 46. At the shaft 46 the diaphragm 43 is attached.<br>
This lies next to the orifice 44. The mobile sheating girder 52 of the common scissor indicated with 45 is arranged thereon.<br>
The second sheating beam 53 is fixed at the housing 42, the shaft 46 is freely moveable opposed to this sheating girder. It lies with its cutting blades outside the orifice 44.<br>
In fig. 2 the diaphragm 43 is shown in its extreme orifice position 70. Also the scissor 45 is completely opened. The toothed quadrant 47 lies closely at a stopper 58. A spring 54 arranged around the shaft 46 presses both the sheating girder 52 and 53 under tension against one another.<br>
Figure 3 shows the diaphragm 43 in its closing position 71. For closing of the orifice 44 the motor drives the pinion 48 in the arrow-head direction 55, whereby the toothed quadrant disk 47 moves itself opposite to the clock-wise direction in the arrow-head direction 56 and takes along the diaphragm 43 as well as the sheating girder 52. When the orifice 44 is completely closed through diaphragm<br><br>
9<br>
43, there lies a nose 57 of the toothed segment pulley 47 at a stopper 58 and the scissor 45 is closed.<br>
The position 71 shown in the Fig. No. 3 takes in the diaphragm 43 then, when the thread drawn-in in the pipe line 29 is cut at the length required for the top winding. When the thread is cut, the rotation of the cops in the unwinding direction is stopped. When now the thread 3 is cut, it has the length required for the winding of the upper winding. As is already known from the DE 44 24 462 Al the top winding can be enlarged by a certain thread length, when after the thread cut the diaphragm 43 is opened and the cop is rotated by a precisely defined number of the rotations in the unwinding directions. In fig. 4 the diaphragm 43 covers in its position 72 already through the half of the orifice 44. Through the change of the orifice cross-section the suction flow raises itself accordingly and thereby the vacuum lying closely at the orifice 44. This vacuum transmit itself in the pipe line 29, so that the vacuum can be raised also at the slit 30.<br>
The position 72 of the diaphragm 43 as shown in the Fig. No. 4 is selected especially then, when the thread end of the detached bottom-winding in the pipe line 29 should be drawn in. the more the orifice 44 is closed through the diaphragm 43, the larger is the suction flow lying closely and thereby the prevailing vacuum in the pipe line 29. In order not to wind the upper winding too tightly, it can be of advantage, when, for example, the position 70 of the diaphragm 43 as is shown in the Fig. No. 2 is selected. As already pointed out, it is possible in accordance with the invention, to bring through the control switch 21 the diaphragm 43 on the ground of the yarn parameter assigned to the cop as well as the present procedural steps matched in such a position, that an optimal vacuum rests against the slot 30, in each case.<br>
In fig. 5 a cam 61 is provided as actuator for the diaphragm 43. It is driven through a motor 62. The diaphragm is also here rotary supported (pivoted) on the shaft 46 and stays in the position 72 known from the Fig. 4. For the sake of<br><br>
10<br>
the facility of inspection the sheating girder are not represented. The diaphragm 43 shows an actuating cam 63, at whose end a feeler wheel (roller feeler) 64 is arranged, which rests against the outer outline (contour) 65 of the cam 61. The contour is synchronized (coordinated) to the desired sequence of the positions of the diaphragm, in each case. The cam can be exchanged with a cam with another contour, for example, in case of a change in batch. The diaphragm 43 is attached in the unactuated condition with the help of a spring 68 which is fastened on the one hand at the housing 42 and on the other hand at the diaphragm 43, is drawn in the contact position 71. Towards actuation of the diaphragm the cam 61 pivoted on the axle 66 is rotated through the motor 62 in the arrow head direction 67. there it presses the actuating cam from the indicated contact position 23 in the position 74 represented. When the diaphragm is fully opened, position 70, the actuating cam exists in the indicated position 75.<br><br>
