				<td>PROCESS FOR PRODUCING CHROMANS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for producing chromans; a process for producing intermediate products useful for the synthesis of chromans; and a novel intermediate product useful for the synthesis of chromans.<br>
The chromans produced in accordance with the present invention, including for example 2,5,7,8-tetramethyl-6-acetoxy-2-(4-nitrophenyloxy)methylchroman, are useful as intermediate products for biologically active substances such as tocopherols and pharmaceutical agents such as therapeutic agents of diabetes mellitus, or as intermediate products for polymer materials such as engineering resins, and additionally as stabilizers of organic substances such as fats and fatty oils and synthetic resins.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
As the process for producing chromans, conventionally, the following processes shown in (a) to (d) have been known, (a) Ring closing reaction of an allyl phenol<br>
Process for producing chromans, comprising ring closing of an allyl phenol obtained by reacting an allyl halide, an allyl alcohol or a diolef in with a phenol ( see "DAIYUKIKAGAKU" , Vol. 14 , pages 215-217).<br>
According to the conventional process (a), for example, a case wherein sodium phenolate is used as a phenol and l,l-dimethyl-3-halogenated-l-propene is used as an allyl halide is illustrated as follows;<br>
wherein X represents a halogen atom.<br>
(b) Reaction of o-oxybenzyl alcohol with an unsaturated<br>
compound<br>
Process for producing chromans, comprising heating and reacting together o-oxybenzyl alcohol and an unsaturated compound with no solvent at a temperture within a range of 180<br>
to 22000 (see "DAIYUKIKAGAKU", Vol.14, page 220).<br>
According to the conventional process (b) , for example, a case wherein 1-propene is used as an unsaturated compound is illustrated as follows.<br>
(c) Reaction of the oxidized product of o-[l-<br>
(alkylthio)alkyl]phenol with an unsaturated compound<br>
Process for producing chromans, comprising oxidizing o-[l-(alkylthio)alkyl]phenol with silver oxide under mild conditions, and reacting the resulting oxidized product with<br>
a vinyl ether [see Bull. Chem. Soc. Japan, Vol.63, page 1062(1990)].<br>
According to the conventional process (c), a case wherein vinyl methyl ether is used as a vinyl ether is illustrated as follows.<br>
(d) Reaction of a phenol, a formaldehyde and an unsaturated compound<br>
Process for producing chromans, comprising heating and reacting a phenol, a formaldehyde and an unsaturated compound in a solvent of a hydrocarbon or a halogenated aromatic compound<br>
at a temperature within a range of 160 to 250 Â°C (see Japanese<br>
Patent Application Laid-open 92283/1985).<br>
According to the conventional process (d), a case wherein a pyrroline based compound is used as an unsaturated compound is illustrated as follows.<br>
However, the aforementioned conventional processes (a) to (d) have the following problems, and therefore, it cannot be said that these processes are satisfactory as the process for producing chromans.<br>
According to the conventional process (a), an objective chroman sometimes cannot be produced, depending on the types of the substituents present on the allyl compound or the diolefin to react with the phenol, and the yield is generaly low. According to the conventional process (b) , it is difficult to synthesize o-oxybenzyl alcohol as the raw material in a high yield, and therefore, it is difficult to produce chromans as the objective compounds at high productivity. According to the conventional process (c), it is required to use a specific compound o- [ 1- (alkylthio)alkyl] phenol as the raw material, and so as to oxidize the phenol, it is also required to use expensive silver oxide at a vast amount of an equal molar amount or more, and therefore, the production cost of the objective chromans is escalated, disadvantageously. According to the conventional process (d), the yield of chromans is generally low of 10 to 50 %.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a process for producing chromans, by using readily available raw materials and inexpensive raw materials in a high yield in a simple and smooth manner at an industrially high productivity.<br>
And it is an object of the present invention to provide compounds to be possibly utilized for producing chromans.<br>
The present inventors have made research works to attain the above objects. The inventors have found that chromans can be produced in a simple fashion in a high yield, by using readily available a phenol compound, a formaldehyde and an unsaturated<br>
compound having a carbon-carbon double bond as raw materials and reacting them in the presence of a secondary amine and an acid, and the inventors have filed the application thereof (see USP 5,495,026).<br>
According to the process by the present inventors, the objective chromans can be generated by the following reaction formulas. In the following reaction formulas, herein, an example is illustrated wherein 4-acetoxy-2,3,5-trimethyl phenol is used as a phenol compound; 2-methyl-2-propen-l-ol is used as an unsaturated compound having a carbon-carbon double bond; and dibutylamine is used as a secondary amine; and acetic acid is used as an acid.<br>
Compared with the aforementioned conventional processes (a) to (d), the invention by the present inventors is excellent in that the objective chromans can be produced industrially in a simple manner at low cost, in a high yield, by using readily available raw materials, particularly in that the objective chromans can be produced in an extremely high yield, when using a compound having a carbon-carbon double bond and a hydroxyl group within the molecule or a compound having a carbon-carbon double bond and an electron withdrawing group such as ester group and acyl group, which is directly bonded to a carbon atom<br>
composing the carbon-carbon double bond, thereof.<br>
After further investigations, then, the present inventors have found that chromans can be produced in a high yield by reacting a phenol compound, a formaldehyde and an alcohol in the presence of a secondary amine and an acid at a specific temperature to generate an alkoxymethylphenol compound, removing the secondary amine out of the reaction system (process 1) , and then reacting the resulting alkoxymethylphenol compound with a specific compound having a carbon-carbon double bond (process 2); and that the objective chromans can be produced in a smooth manner in a high yield at such two-step process, particularly when using a compound having a carbon-carbon double bond and no hydroxyl group within the molecule or a compound having a carbon-carbon double bond and no electron withdrawing group directly bonded to a carbon atom composing the carbon-carbon double bond thereof.<br>
Furthermore, the present inventors have found that specific ones of the alkoxymethylphenol compounds obtained at the process 1 according to the process for producing chromans at the two-step reaction process are novel compounds, which can be effectively utilized as intermediate products for producing chromans and the like, and based on these findings, the present invention has been attained.<br>

With not any limitation, specific examples of the unsaturated compound (1) include aliphatic unsaturated hydrocarbons such as 1-octene, 2,6-dimethyl-1-heptene, 2,6,10,14-tetramethyl-l-pentadecene, and 2,6-dimethyl-l,5-heptadiene; unsaturated hydrocarbons with aromatic groups, such as styrene; hydrocarbons having a carbon-carbon double bond with an alkyl group and aryl group, substituted with nitro group and nitrophenyloxy group, such as 2-(4-nitrophenyloxy)methyl-1-propene.<br>
In the process 2 of the present invention, so as to give the objective chromans in a smooth manner in a high yield, the unsaturated compound (1) is used preferably within the range<br><br>
of 0.8 to 20 molar equivalents based on one molar equivalent of the alkoxymethylphenol compound, more preferably within the range of 1 to 10 molar equivalents to one molar equivalent of the alkoxymethylphenol compound.<br>

heating the resulting mixture at a temperature of 150 Â°C or more.<br>

compound, a formaldehyde and an alcohol and the process 2 of reacting the alkoxymethylphenol compound obtained at the process 1 with the unsaturated compound (1), as described above.<br>
However, the present invention is not limited to the process for producing chromans at such two-step reaction process, but chromans may satisfactorily be produced by one-step process comprising reacting an alkoxymethylphenol compound with the ortho position to the phenolic hydroxyl group being substituted with an alkoxymethyl group as a starting material with the unsaturated compound (1) at a temperature of<br>

process for producing chromans at such one-step process.<br>
The means for procuring the alkoxymethylphenol compound to be used as the starting material is not limited specifically, for example, such compound which is preliminarily prepared separately or commercially available may satisfactorily be used. Additionally, the reaction of the alkoxymethylphenol compound with the unsaturated compound (1) may satisfactorily be conducted under the same conditions as those for the process 2.<br>
