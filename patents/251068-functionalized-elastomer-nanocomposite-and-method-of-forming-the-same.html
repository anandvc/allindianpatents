This application claims the benefit of Provisional Application No. 60/394,152, filed, July 5, 2002, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety,<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to nanocomposites comprising clays and elastomers. More particularly, the present invention relates to nanocomposites suitable for air barriers that are a blend of a clay and a functionalized phenyl-containing, or styrenic-based, elastomer, wherein the funetionalization is carried out via free radical initiated reactions with unsaturated compounds.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Nanocomposites are polymer systems containing inorganic particles with at least one dimension in the nanometer range. Elastomers comprising phenyl groups including, for example, styrenic-based elastomers comprising at least one styrene or substituted styrene unit therein, are one type of elastomer that can be incorporated into a nanocomposite.  Some examples of these are disclosed in US 6,060,549, 6,103,817, 6,034,164, 5,973,053, 5,936,023, 5,883,173, 5,807,629, 5,665,183, 5,576,373, and 5,576,372. A common type of inorganic particle used in, nanocomposites are phyllosilicates, an inorganic substance from the general class of so called "nano-clays" or "clays". Ideally, intercalation should take place in the nanocomposite, wherein the polymer inserts into the space or gallery between the clay surfaces. Ultimately, it is desirable to have exfoliation, wherein the polymer is fully dispersed with the individual nanometer-size clay platelets. Due to the general enhancement in air barrier qualities of various polymer blends when clays are present, there is a desire to have a nanocomposite with low air permeability; especially a dynamically vulcanized elastomer nanocomposite such as used in the manufacture of tires.<br>
One method to improve nanocomposite performance is to use fiinctionalized polymers blended with clay. This approach has been limited to materials that are soluble in water or to materials that can be incorporated into the polymerization reaction. This approach has been used to prepare nylon nanocomposites, using foj example, oligomeric and monomeric caprolactam as the modifier. Polyolefin nanocomposites, such as polypropylene nanocomposites, have utilized maleic anhydride grafted polypropylenes to achieve some success in the formation of nanocomposites.<br>
To form articles such as air barriers, it is desirable to use elastomers such as isobutylene-based elastomers, for example, poly(isobutylene-co-p-alkylstyrene) elastomers and poly(isobutylene-co-isoprene) elastomers. While these elastomers have been fiinctionalized in order to improve compatibility or cross-linkability with other polymers, suitability of such fiinctionalized polymers for nanocomposites has not been demonstrated or disclosed. See, for example, US 6,372,855 Bl; 6,015,862; 5,849,828; 5,480,810; 5,814,707; 5,700,871; 5,498,673; 5,356,950; JP 11323023 (98 JP-130725 A); EP 0 787 157 Bl; and Liu et ai, 43 POLYMER BULLETIN 51-58 (1999). What would be desirable is to provide an improved air barrier using such nanomposites that include these styrenic-based elastomers, thus improving up0n the air barrier qualities that exist for these elastomers,<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a nanocomposite suitable for an air barrier comprising a clay, desirably a swellable clay, and an elastomer comprising C2 to C10 olefin derived units; wherein the elastomer comprises fiinctionalized monomer units pendant to the elastomer. Desirable embodiments of the elastomer include poly(isobuty]ene-co-p-alkyistyrene) elastomers and poly(isobutylene-co-isoprene)<br>
elastomers, which are functionalized by reacting free radical generating agents and unsaturated carboxylic acids, unsaturated esters, unsaturated imides, and the like, with the elastomer. The clay is exfoliated in one embodiment by the addition of exfoliating agents such as alkyl amines and silanes to the clay. The composition can include secondary rubbers such as general purpose rubbers, and curatives, fillers, and the like. The nanocomposites of the invention have improved air barrier properties such as are useful for tire innerliners and innertubes.<br>

These swellable clays generally comprise particles containing a plurality of silicate platelets having a thickness of 8-12A, and contain exchangeable cations such as Na+, Ca+25 K+ or Mg+2 present at the interlayer surfaces.<br>
The swellable clay may be exfoliated by treatment with organic molecules (swelling or exfoliating "agents" or "additives") capable of undergoing ion exchange reactions with the cations present at the interlayer surfaces of the layered silicate. Suitable exfoliating agents include cationic surfactants such as ammonium, alkylamines or alkylammonium (primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary), phosphonium or sulfonium derivatives of aliphatic, aromatic or arylaliphatic amines, phosphines and sulfides.

The exfoliating additive such as described herein is present in the composition in an amount to achieve optimal air retention as measured by the permeability testing described herein. For example, the additive may be present from 0.1 to 20 phr in one embodiment, and from 0.2 to 15 phr in another embodiment, and from 0.3 to 10 phr in yet another embodiment. The exfoliating agent, if present, may be added to the composition at any stage, for example, the addiuve may be added to the interpolymer, followed by addition of the clay, or may be added to the elastomer and clay mixture; or the additive may be first blended with the clay, followed by blending with the interpolymer in yet another embodiment.<br>
In    another    embodiment    of   the    invention,    improved    elastomer impermeability is achieved by the presence of at least one polyfunctional curative An embodiment of such polyfunctional curatives can be described by the formula Z-R7-Z', wherein R7 is one of a C1 to C15 alkyl, C2 to C15 alkenyl, and C6 to C12 cyclic aromatic moiety, substituted or unsubstituted; and Z and Z' are the same or<br>
    different and are one of a thiosulfate group, mercapto group, aldehyde group,  carboxylic acid group, peroxide group, alkenyl group, or other similar group that is capable of crosslinking, either intermolecularly or intramolecularly, one or more strands of a polymer having reactive groups such as unsaturation. So-called bis-thiosulfate compounds are an example of a desirable class of polyfunctional<br>
   compounds included in the above formula. Non-limiting examples of such polyfunctional curatives are as hexamethylene bis(sodium thiosulfate) and hexamethylene bis(cinnamaldehyde), and others are well known in the rubber<br>
compounding arts. These and other suitable agents are disclosed in, for example, the BLUE BOOK, MATERIALS, COMPOUNDING INGREDIENTS, MACHINERY AND SERVICES FOR RUBBER (Don. R. Smith, ed., Lippincort &amp; Petto Inc. 2001). The polyfunctional curative, if present, may be present in the composition from 0.1 to 8 phr in one embodiment, and from 0,2 to 5 phr in yet another embodiment.<br>
Treatment with the exfoliating agents described above results in intercalation or "exfoliation" of the layered platelets as a consequence of a reduction of the ionic forces holding the layers together and introduction of molecules between layers which serve to space the layers at distances of greater than 4A, preferably greater than 9A. This separation allows the layered silicate to more readily sorb polymerizable monomer material and polymeric material between the layers and facilitates further delamination of the layers when the intercalate is shear mixed with matrix polymer material to provide a uniform dispersion of the exfoliated layers within the polymer matrix.<br>
The amount of clay or exfoliated clay incorporated in the nanocomposites in accordance with an embodiment of the invention is sufficient to develop an improvement in the mechanical properties and barrier properties of the nanocomposite, for example, tensile strength or oxygen permeability. Amounts generally will range from 0 1 wt% to 50 wt% in one embodiment, and from 0.5 wt% to 10 wt% in another embodiment, and from 0.5 wt% to 15 wt°/o in another embodiment, and from 1 wt% to 30 wt% in yet another embodiment, and from 1 wt% to 5 wt% in yet another embodiment, based on the polymer content of the nanocomposite. Expressed in parts per hundred rubber, the clay or exfoliated clay may be present from 1 to 30 phr in one embodiment, and from 5 to 20 phr in another embodiment. In one embodiment, the exfoliated clay is an alkylamine-exfoliated clay.<br>

The halogenated butyl rubber is brominated butyl rubber, and in another embodiment is chlorinated butyl rubber. General properties and processing of halogenated butyl rubbers is described in THE VANDERBILT RUBBER HANDBOOK 105-122 (Robert F. Ohm ed., R.T. Vanderbilt Co., Inc. 1990), and in RUBBER TECHNOLOGY 311-321 (1995), Butyl rubbers, halogenated butyl rubbers, and star-branched butyl rubbers are described by Edward Kresge andH.C.

black, and combinations of any of these. In another embodiment, the filler is a blend of carbon black and silica. The preferred filler for such articles as tire treads and sidewalls is reinforcing grade carbon black present at a level of from 10 to 100 phi of the blend, more preferably from 30 to 80 phr in another embodiment, and from 50 to 80 phr in yet another embodiment. Useful grades of carbon black, as described in RUBBER TECHNOLOGY, 59-85, range from Nl 10 to N990. More desirably, embodiments of the carbon black useful in, for example, tire treads are N229, N351, N339, N220, N234 and NI10 provided in ASTM (D3037, D1510, and D3765). Embodiments of the carbon black useful in, for example, sidewalls in tires, are N330, N351, N550, N650, N660, and N762.<br>
The fillers of the present invention may be any size and typically range, for example, from about 0.0001 urn to about 100 urn.

One or more crosslinking agents are preferably used in the elastomeric compositions of the present invention, especially when silica is the primary filler, or is present in combination with another filler More preferably, the coupling agent may be a Afunctional organosilane crosslinking agent. By an "organosilane crosslinking agent" is meant any silane coupled filler and/or crosslinking activator and/or silane reinforcing agent known to those skilled in the art including, but not limited to, vinyl triethoxysilane, vinyl-tris-(beta-methoxyethoxy)silane, methacryloylpropyltrimethoxysilane, gamma-amino-propyl triethoxysilane (sold commercially as A1100 by Witco), gamma-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane (A 189 by Witco) and the like, and mixtures thereof, In one embodiment, bis-(3-triethoxysilypropy])tetrasulflde (sold commercially as "Si69") is employed.<br>
A processing aid may also be present in the composition of the invention. Processing aids include, but are not limited to, plasticizers, tackifiers, extenders,<br>

The compositions produced in accordance with the present invention typically contain other components and additives customarily used in rubber mixes, such as effective amounts of other nondiscolored and nondiscoloring processing aids, pigments, accelerators, crosslinking and curing materials, antioxidants, antiozonants. General classes of accelerators include amines, guanidines, thioureas, thiazoles, thiurams, sulfenamides, sulfenimides, thiocarbamates, xanthates, and the like. Crosslinking and curing agents include sulfur, zinc oxide, and fatty acids. Peroxide cure systems may also be used. The components, and other curatives, are typically present from 0.1 to 10 phr in the composition.<br>
Generally, polymer blends, for example, those used to produce tires, are crosslinked. It is known that the physical properties, performance characteristics, and durability of vulcanized rubber compounds are directly related to the number (crosslink density) and type of crosslinks formed during the vulcanization reaction. (See, e.g., Helt et al., The Post Vulcanization Stabilization for NR in RUBBER WORLD, 18-23 (1991). Generally, polymer blends may be crosslinked by adding curative molecules, for example sulfur, metal oxides, organometallic compounds, radical initiators, etc., followed by heating. In particular, the following metal oxides are common curatives that will function in the present invention1 ZnO, CaO, MgO, A12O3, C1O3, FeO, Fe2O3, and NiO. These metal oxides can be used alone or in conjunction with the corresponding metal fatty acid complex (e.g., zinc stearate, calcium stearate, etc.), or with the organic and fatty acids added alone, such as stearic<br>
acid, and optionally other curatives such as sulfur or a sulfur compound, an alkylperoxide compound, diamines or derivatives thereof (e.g., DIAK products sold by DuPont). (See also, Formulation Design and Curing Characteristics o/NBR Mixes for Seals, RUBBER WORLD 25-30 (1993). This method of curing elastomers may be accelerated and is often used for the vulcanization of elastomer blends.<br>
The acceleration of the cure process is accomplished in the present invention by adding to the composition an amount of an accelerant, often an organic compound The mechanism for accelerated vulcanization of natural rubber involves complex interactions between the curative, accelerator, activators and polymers. Ideally, all of the available curative is consumed in the formation of effective crosslinks which join together two polymer chains and enhance the overall strength of the polymer matrix. Numerous accelerators are known in the art and include, but are not limited to, the following: stearic acid, diphenyl guanidine (DPG), tetramethylthiuram disulfide (TMTD), 4,4'-dithiodimorpholine (DTDM), tetrabutylthiuram disulfide (TBTD), ben20thjazyl disulfide (MBTS), hexamethylene-1,6-bisthiosulfate disodium salt dihydrate (sold commercially as DURALINK™ HTS by Flexsys), 2-(morpholinothio) benzothiazole (MBS or MOR), blends of 90% MOR and 10% MBTS (MOR 90), N-tertiarybutyl-2-benzothiazole sulfenamide (TBBS), and N-oxydiethylene thiocarbamyl-N-oxydiethylene sulfonamide (OTOS), zinc 2-ethyl hexanoate (2EH), and "thioureas".<br>

The Functionalization Process<br>
The functionalized or "grafted" C2 to C7 olefin elastomers for use in the nanocomposites of the present invention are prepared by contacting an elastomer as described above, with one or more functionalizing compounds in the presence of one or more free radical initiators at grafting reaction conditions in a reaction zone. The components are "contacted" under conditions that allow the components to react, thus resulting in the elastomer being functionalized with functional groups pendant to the elastomer backbone structure. The reaction can take place in the presence of the clay in one embodiment, and in the absence of the clay in another embodiment, followed by addition of the clay to the reaction product of the functionalizing compound and the elastomer.<br>
Any part of the elastomer, any monomer unit or any moiety pendant to the elastomer may be functionalized as a result of the functionalization. In one embodiment, the styrenic or substituted styrenic derived unit of the elastomer, when present, is the functionalized monomer unit.<br>
The elastomer, a copolymer of isobutylene and an alkylstyrene in one embodiment, and a copolymer of isobutylene and isoprene in another embodiment, or other the corresponding elastomer, is contacted with the functionalizing compound in the presence of a free radical initiator which may be a chemical compound or radiation. Suitable free radical initiators include (1) thermally decomposable compounds which generate radicals such as azo compounds or organic peroxides; (2) compounds which generate free radicals by non-thermal methods such as photochemical or redox processes; (3) compounds which have inherent radical character such as molecular oxygen; or (4) electromagnetic radiation such as X-rays, electron beams, visible light, ultraviolet-light<br>
Suitable organic peroxide compounds for use as free radical initiators<br>
include hydroperoxides, dialkyl peroxides, diacy] peroxides, peroxyesters, peroxydicarbonates, peroxyketals, ketone peroxides and organosulfonyl peroxides.<br>
Preferably, the free radical initiator is an organic peroxide compound having a half-life, at the reaction temperature, of less than the reaction/residence time employed.<br>
When the free radical initiator is a compound, suitable molar ratio of free radical initiator compound to functionalizing compound may range from 0.001:2 to 1:2 in one embodiment, and from 0.1:1 io 1:1 in another embodiment.<br>
Desirably, the molar amount of functionalizing compound expressed in mmoles per gram, in the contacting zone may be 1.1 to 20 times the molar amount of these components as is desired in the final grafted copolymer. Thus, when the molar amount of functionalizing compound in the grafted copolymer is 0.05 mmoles per gram of product polymer, the amount of functionalizing compound introduced in the reaction 2one is suitably from 1 to 0.055 mmoles per gram of the elastomer plus functionalizing compound present in the reaction mixture.<br>
The grafting reaction may be conducted in the absence of a diluent or in a solution using a diluent. When a diluent is present in the reaction zone, suitable diluents include saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, and perhalogenated hydrocarbons.<br>
Preferably, the grafting reaction to produce the grafted polymer of the present invention in the melt phase is conducted in the absence of a diluent, wherein the elastomer is in the molten phase. The reaction temperature is chosen to be appropriate for the initiator used.<br>
Suitable reaction conditions include a temperature ranging from 0°C to 300°C.  The suitable reaction temperature will vary according to the free radical<br>
initiator used. When an azo compound is used as the initiator, suitable temperatures will generally range from 25°C to 150°C. When an organic peroxide is used as initiator, suitable temperatures range from 50°C to 250°C. Higher temperatures may be used for other types of free radical initiators. When the reaction is conducted in the presence of a diluent, for example, solution processes, the reaction temperature will generally be below 200°C. For melt phase processes, (i.e., bulk phase processes), the reaction temperature may range from 25°C such as in conventional electron beam irradiation equipment to 250°C such as in polymer mixing equipment. The process for producing the grafted polymers of the present invention may be conducted as a batch process or as a continuous process.<br>
The reaction is performed in a suitable reaction zone which may be a polymer mixing device such as a Banbury mixer, Brabender mixer, or a single or multiple screw extruder and the like for melt phase polymers or a glass flask, metal tank or tube when the process is conducted in the presence of a diluent.<br>
When the molten elastomer itself is the reaction medium, uniform dispersion of the grafting agent and of the initiator is preferably performed by predispersion or by the incorporation of suitable mixing elements into the reactor (e.g., incorporation of mixing screw sections in an extruder). When electromagnetic radiation is used, dispersion of the initiator and functionalizing compound will include uniform exposure of all parts of the copolymer or copolymer solution to the beam.<br>
In one embodiment, the grafting process to produce the grafted polymer of the invention is carried out in a twin screw extruder having, in sequence, screw elements, which will (i) heat the polymer by shear and compression to or close to the desired reaction temperature, (ii) mix the copolymer at or close to reaction temperature with the grafting agent, (iii) mix the copolymer containing the grafting agent with the initiator, (iv) allow appropriate residence time for the grafting reaction, (v) allow venting or washing away of unreacted grafting agent<br>
and initiator coproducts, (vj) mix with clay, with proper residence time and dispersion time, desirably mixing at a temperature less than 250°C, (vii) allow mixing of any desired stabilizers or additives and (vii) forward the reacted, vented stabilized polymer to an appropriate finishing device (e.g. drumming device, baler, pelletizer, etc). In another embodiment, steps (vi) and (vii) may merge into one step by adding clay, desirably exfoliated clay, and the desired stabilizers or additives (e.g., processing oils, fillers, curatives, accellerams, etc.) at the same time.<br>
The functionalized monomer unit (or alternately, the number of functional groups) may be present in the elastomer of the present invention in an amount ranging from 1.5 to 0.001 millimole (mmole) per gram of functionalized (or "grafted") elastomer in one embodiment, and from 1.0 to 0.002 mmole per gram in another embodiment, and from 0.8 to 0.01 mmole per gram of the grafted elastomer product in yet another embodiment. Described another way, the functionalized unit is present on the elastomer from 0,01 wt% to 15 wt% by weight of the elastomer in one embodiment, and from 0.05 wt% to 10 wt% by weight of the elastomer in another embodiment.<br>

TEST METHODS<br>
Permeability Testing. All specimens were compression molded with slow cooling to provide defect free pads. Typical thickness of a compression molded pad is about 15 mil. using an Arbor press, 2" diameter disks were then punched out from molded pads for permeability testing. These disks were conditioned in a vacuum oven at 60°C overnight prior to the measurement. The oxygen permeation measurements were done using a Mocon OX-TRAN 2/61 permeability tester at 40°C under the principle of R. A, Pasternak et. al. in 8 JOURNAL OF POLYMER SCIENCE- PART A-2 467 (1970). Disks thus prepared were mounted on a template and sealed with a vacuum grease. 10 psi nitrogen was kept on one side of the disk, whereas the other side is 10 psi oxygen. Using the oxygen sensor on the nitrogen side, increase in oxygen concentration on the nitrogen side with time could be monitored. The time required for oxygen to permeate through the disk, or for oxygen concentration on the nitrogen side to reach a constant value, is recorded and used to determine the oxygen permeability.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The present invention, while not meant to be limiting by, may be better understood by reference to the following examples and Tables.<br>
As a comparative example (comparative Example 1), the permeability of poly(isobutylene-co-jj-methylstyrene) ("XP 50") containing 11.5 wt% p-methylstyrene derived units (40.5 g) was measured. The results of oxygen permeability measurements are shown in Table 2.<br>
In Example 2, XP 50 containing 11.5 wt% p-methylstyrene (42 g) was blended with maleic anhydride (3 g), LUPEROX 11M75 (1 mL) and Cloisite 6A<br>
in a Brabender at 160°C at 60 rpm for 20 minutes while LUPEROX was added slowly over a period of 5 minutes. The permeability data is summarized for each example in Table 2.<br>
In Example 3, the following procedure was carried out: XP 50 comprising 11.5 wt% p-methylstyrene (42 g) was blended with maleic anhydride (3g) and LUPEROX 11M75 (1 mL) in a Brabender at 190°C at 60 rpm for 20 minutes. Next, Cloisite 6A (4.5 g) was added and the melt was mixed for 15 additional minutes. The permeability data is summarized in Table 2.<br>
In Example 4, the following procedure was carried out: XP 50 containing 11.5 wt% p-methylstyrene (42 g) was blended with maleic anhydride (3 g) and LUPEROX 11M75 (1 mL) in a Brabender at 160°C at 60 rpm for 20 minutes. Then Cloisite 6A (4.5 grams) was added and the melt was mixed for 15 more minutes. The permeability data is summarized for each example in Table 2.<br>
For examples 5-16, the following procedure was carried out: 45 g of XP 50,11,5 wt% p-methylstyrene, was melt blended in a Brabender for one minute at a rotor speed of 60 rpm. A mixture of peroxide (as indicated in Table 2) and maleic anhydride (in 3 mL acetone) was slowed mixed for 5 minutes at 40°C. This mixture was then added to the XP 50 in the Brabender and mixed for 5 minutes with a rotor speed of 60 rpm at 200°C. From this, 40.5 g of the XP 50 reaction product was then melt blended in a Brabender for 1 minute at a rotor speed of 60 rpm and 160°C. To this melt was added 4.5 g of Cloisite 6A. After the clay addition, the mixture was blended for 10 minutes at 60 rpm and 160°C. The results of oxygen permeability are shown in Table 2.<br>
Example 17 illustrates the sequential process i) functionalization, venting of excess functionalizing compound iii) clay addition and mixing to prepare nanocomposite. For example 17, the following procedure was carried out: Butyl rubber (45 g, XP 50, 11.5 % PMS) was melt in Brabender for one minutes with a rotor speed of 60 rpm at 180 °C. Next, a solution of maleic anhydride (1.5 grams)<br>
and LUPEROX P (1 mL) in 1.5 mL acetone was added. After 8 minutes, the temperature was increased to 210 °C with mixing for 3 minutes. Then cooling down to 160 °C, 3 grams of modified polymer was taken out. To the remaining modified butyl rubber was added Cloisite 6A (4.5 g). After the addition of clay, the mixture was mixed for 10 more minutes at 60 rpm and 160 °C. The results of oxygen permeability are shown in Table 2.<br>
Example 18 illustrates the sequential addition of functionalizing agent and peroxide. For example 18, the following procedure was carried out: Butyl rubber (45 g, XP 50, 11.5 °/o PMS) was meh blended in Brabender for one minute with a rotor speed of 60 rpm at 180°C. Then a solution of maleic anhydride (1.5 grams) and LUPEROX P (1 mL) in 3 mL acetone was added. After 8 minutes, more maleic anhydride (1,5 grams) and LUPEROX P (1 mL) in 3 mL acetone was added. After 8 minutes, the temperature was increased to 210°C and mixing continued for 3 minutes. The mixture was then cooled down to 160 °C; 3 grams of modified polymer was removed. To the remaining modified butyl rubber, Cloisite 6A (4.5 g) was slowly added. After the addition, the mixture was mixed for 10 more minutes at 60 rpm and 160 °C. The results of oxygen permeability are shown in Table 2,<br>
Example 19 illustrates the use of functionalized butyl for blend application. For example 19, the following procedure was carried out: Butyl rubber (XP50, 31.5 grams) and maleic anhydride-modified XP50 (9.0 grams, succinic anhydride weight % in final polymer = 0.9) were melt blended in a Brabender for three minutes with a rotor speed of 60 rpm at 160 °C. To this melt was added Cloisite 6A (4.5 grams). The mixture was further mixed for 10 minutes. The results of oxygen permeability are shown in Table 2.<br>
Example 20 illustrates the use of maleimide as functionalizing compound. For example 20, the following procedure was carried out: Butyl rubber (45 g, XP 50, 11.5 % PMS) was melt blended in Brabender for one minute with a rotor<br>
speed of 60 xpm. A mixture of LUPEROX 11M75 (1.86 mL) and maleimide (2.97 grams) were slowly added and mixed for 5 minutes at 40°C. The blend was mixed in for 5 minutes with a rotor speed of 60 rpm at 200°C. Modified butyl rubber (40.5 g) was melt blended in Brabender for one minute with a rotor speed of 60 rpm and 160°C. Then, Cloisite 6A (4.5 g) was slowly added, and after the addition the mixture was mixed for 10 more minutes at 60 rpm and 160°C. The results of oxygen permeability are shown in Table 2<br>
Example 21 illustrates the use of maleic acid as functionalizing compound. For example 21, the following procedure was carried out: Butyl rubber (45 g, XP 50, 11.5 % PMS) was melt in Brabender for one minutes with a rotor speed of 60 rpm. A mixture of LUPEROX 11M75 (1.86 mL) and maleic acid (3.60 grams) were slowly added and the melt was mixed for 5 minutes at 40°C. Then, the blend was mixed in for 5 minutes with a rotor speed of 60 rpm at 200°C. Modified butyl rubber (40.5 g) was melt blended in Brabender for one minute with a rotor speed of 60 rpm and 160 CC. Then, Cloisite 6A (4.5 g) was slowly added, followed by additional mixing for 10 more minutes at 60 rpm and 160°C. The results of oxygen permeability are shown in Table 2.<br>
