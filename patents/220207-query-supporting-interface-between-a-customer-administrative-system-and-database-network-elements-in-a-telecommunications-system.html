QUERY SUPPORTING INTERFACE BETWEEN A<br>
CUSTOMER ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM AND DATABASE<br>
NETWORK ELEMENTS OF A TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Technical Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to telecommunications systems and, in particular, to an enhancement of the 5 interface between a customer administrative system and database network elements of a telecommunications system to support query oriented processing in addition to transaction oriented processing.<br>
Description of Related Art<br>
10       Reference is now made to FIGURE 1 wherein there is shown a block diagram of a portion of a telecommunications<br>
network 10 implementing a prior art transaction-based<br><br>
interface (IF) 12 between a customer administrative system (CAS) 14 and a plurality of database network elements (NE) 16. The telecommunications network 10 comprises a wireless (for example, cellular) communications system, and each database network element 16 comprises a home location register (HLR) database storing permanent and temporary wireless subscriber data. The permanent data stored in the database network element 16 comprises fixed information concerning the communications service subscripted to by each subscriber. The temporary data stored in the database network element 16 comprises variable information concerning the current location of each subscriber.<br>
The customer administrative system 14 is utilized to engage in transactions relating to the administration of the permanent data stored in each database network element 16. These administration activities, in general, relate to transactions performed for the purposes of customer (i.e., subscriber) creation or definition, service activation, and the like, relating to a given customer. More particularly, the transactions relate to subscriber data administration tasks such as:<br>
- subscription initiation/removal/status,<br>
-	subscriber activation/cancellation,<br>
-	service provision/withdrawal/activation/passivation,<br>
-	C-number (transfer) definition,<br>
-	pass code changes, and<br>
-	serial number changes.<br>
The transactions may further relate to authentication administration tasks such as authentication activation/change/deactivation/status. Additionally, the transactions relate to numbering plan configuration including number range assignment, numbering plan deletion and numbering plan viewing.<br>
By "transaction-based" it is meant that the interface 12 receives orders originated at the customer administrative system 14 and directed (i.e., addressed) to a particular one of the database network elements 16, converts those commands to a proper format for communication to and/understanding by the addressed database network element, and routes to the addressed database network element. Similarly, the interface 12 receives any response to the order from the addressed database network element 16, converts the response to a proper format for communication to and/understanding by the<br>
customer administrative system 14 that originated the order, and routes to the originating customer administrative system. Thus, one order generated by the customer administrative system 14 which is sent through the interface 12 to an addressed database network element 16 produces one corresponding response. Queries comprising interrogations of one or more of the database network elements 16, however, cannot be generated by the customer administrative system 14 and pass through the transaction-based interface 12.<br>
There is a need for an improved interface between a customer administrative system and one or more database network elements that will support not only database querying, but also the communication of files containing the results of the querying operation.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An interface between a customer administrative system and one or more database network elements of a wireless communications system includes logic for supporting database querying and the communication of query results by file transfer. The logic within the interface functions<br>
responsive to a query originated by a customer administrative system to process the query and identify which one or ones of the database network elements must be addressed in order to respond to the query. The logic then generates individual query requests in proper format for each individual database network element. The formatted query requests are then routed to the proper database network elements for processing. The logic then receives results of the query processing from each of the addressed database network elements, and collects the information for file transfer back to the requesting customer administrative system.<br>

A more complete understanding of the method and apparatus of the present invention may be acquired by reference to the following Detailed Description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying Drawings wherein:<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Reference is now made to FIGURE 2 wherein there is shown a block diagram of a portion of a telecommunications network 20 implementing a present invention query-based interface (IF) 22 between a customer administrative system (CAS) 24 and a plurality of database network elements (NE) 26. Again, the telecommunications network 20 comprises a wireless (for example, cellular) communications system, and<br>
each database network element 26 comprises a home location register (HLR) database storing permanent and temporary wireless subscriber data as previously described. Thus, the database network elements 26 store permanent data comprising subscriber communications service information, and temporary data comprising the current location of each subscriber.<br>
The query-based interface 22 supports the same transaction-based processing as the prior art interface 12 illustrated in FIGURE 1 and previously described. These transactions involve customer administrative system 24 operation in administrating the permanent data stored in each database network element 22. For example, customer administration system 24 operation in administrating subscriber data (relating to subscriptions, services and the like) , authentication data and numbering plan data are supported by the transaction oriented logic 28 of the interface 22. This transaction oriented logic 28 receives orders originated at the customer administrative system 24, converts those orders into commands having a proper format for communication to and/understanding by an addressed database network element 26, and routes properly formatted<br>
commands to the addressed database network element. The transaction oriented logic 28 further receives any response to the commands from the addressed database network element 26, converts the response (if necessary) to a proper format for communication to and/understanding by the customer administrative system 24 that originated the order, and routes the properly formatted response to the originating customer administrative system.<br>
The interface 22 further supports customer administrative system 24 querying of the plurality of database network elements 26 regarding the stored permanent information. These queries involve customer administrative system 24 operation in searching the permanent data stored in each database network element 26. Customer administrative system 24 operation in searching the subscriber data stored in the plurality of database network elements 26 is supported by a query oriented logic 30 of the interface 22. This query oriented logic 30 receives search requests originated at the customer administrative system 24, determines which one or ones of the plurality of database network elements 26 need to be queried to complete the search request, converts those requests into<br>
queries having a proper format for communication to and/understanding by each individual one of the necessary database network elements, and routes properly formatted queries to the necessary database network element for handling. Following database network element 26 handling of the query, search results are returned back to the interface 22. The query oriented logic 30 then collects the data of the returned search results in a file, signals the customer administrative system 24 which originated the search request, and engages in a file transfer of the data (properly formatted) with that originating customer administrative system.<br>
Reference is now made to FIGURES 3A-3B wherein there are shown nodal operation and signal flow diagrams illustrating query-based interface 22 operation for handling customer administrative system 24 queries of database network elements 26. FIGURES 3A and 3B illustrate two search procedures implemented by the interface 22. In the first procedure, database network element 26 processing of the search request is performed pursuant to a "best effort protocol" wherein the query oriented logic 30 (FIGURE 2} tries to perform as complete a search (i.e., in<br>
as many relevant database network elements) as possible. In the second procedure, database network element 26 processing of the search request is performed pursuant to an "atomic protocol" wherein the query oriented logic 30 only performs the search if a complete search (i.e., in all relevant database network elements) is possible.<br>
Turning first to FIGURE 3A, the customer administrative system 24. sends a machine independent search request 40 to the interface 22. The query oriented logic 30 (FIGURE 2) processes the received search request in action 42 to determine which one or ones of the plurality of database network elements 26 need to be queried to complete the search request. With identification of these database network elements 26, the interface 22 attempts to make a communications connection 44 to each of the identified network elements. A connection to each identified database network element is not a requirement to continued processing and handling of a search request query. Responsive to each connection acknowledgment 46 received from an identified database network element 26, the query oriented logic 30 then translates the received search request in action 48 into a machine dependent<br>
database query 50 specifically formatted for transmission to that acknowledging database network element. Confirmation 52 of the ordering of the search to that acknowledging database network element is then sent back to the customer administrative system 24. Meanwhile, each database network element 26 that received the specially formatted database query 50 performs the requested search (action 54) .<br>
Reference is now made to FIGURE 3B. The customer administrative system 24 sends a machine independent search request 40 to the interface 22. The query oriented logic 30 (FIGURE 2) processes the received search request in action 42 to determine which one or ones of the plurality of database network elements 26 need to be queried to complete the search request. With identification of these database network elements 26, the interface 22 attempts to make a communications connection 44 to each of the identified network elements. Responsive only to a connection acknowledgment 56 received from all of the identified database network elements 26, the query oriented logic 30 then translates the received search request in action 48 into a machine dependent database query 50<br>
specifically formatted for transmission to each database network element. Confirmation 52 of the ordering of the search to all identified database network elements is then sent back to the customer administrative system 24. Meanwhile, all of the identified database network elements 26 that received the specially formatted database query 50 perform the requested search (action 54). If not all of the database network elements 26 acknowledge 56, the confirmation 52 includes an indication that the search has been aborted.<br>
The translation of action 48 performed by the query oriented logic 30 may comprise a conversion of the search request message 40 from a given format and protocol (such as a generic, abstract or machine independent language) associated with the customer administrative system 24 to a certain format and protocol associated with each individual one of the identified database network elements 26 (such as a machine dependent language). For example, the search request message 40 format and protocol may be translated to man-machine-language (MML) commands compatible with each of the database network elements 26. Alternatively, a translation of the search request message<br>
40 may be made via a machine-machine-interface (MMI) (such as standard query language - SQL) which is unique to one or more of the identified database network elements 26. Other translations and conversions may be implemented in accordance with these teachings by persons of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
Reference is now made to FIGURES 4A-4D wherein there are shown nodal operation and signal flow diagrams illustrating query-based interface 22 operation for handling file transfer of query search results. Four alternatives for file transfer are available for use and selection by the query-based interface 22 following database network element 26 delivery 60 of the search results.<br>
In FIGURE 4A, it is assumed that the customer administrative system 24 is connected to the interface 22 by means of a "telnet" service implementing a fairly general, bi-directional, eight-bit byte oriented communications facility supporting a standard method for interfacing between terminal devices and/or terminal-oriented processes. This telnet session may comprise the same session as that which was, or may have been, used to<br>
support the search request 40 and confirmation 52 transaction of FIGURES 3A-3B. The database network element 26 delivered 60 search results are collected by the query oriented logic 30 (FIGURE 2) in a file (action 62). When all the search results have been delivered and the search result file is complete, the query oriented logic 30 sends a search complete notification 64 to the originally requesting customer administrative system 24. The customer administrative system 24 then initiates a file transfer protocol (FTP) link 66, possibly using the existing telnet service, to retrieve the query oriented logic 30 collected search results. In the event the previously existing telnet session from the transaction of FIGURES 3A or 3B times out prior to the notification 64, a new telnet session (not shown, see FIGURES 4C and 4D) may be initiated to support the link 66.<br>
Reference is now made to FIGURE 4B. Here, it is again assumed that the customer administrative system 24 is connected to the interface 22 by means of a "telnet" service. The database network element 26 delivered 60 search results are collected by the query oriented logic 30 (FIGURE 2) in a file (action 62). When all the search<br>
results have been delivered and the search result file is complete, the query oriented logic 30 of the interface 22 initiates a file transfer protocol (FTP) link 66, possibly using the existing telnet service, to deliver the collected search results to the originally requesting customer administrative system 24. No independent notification of search completion is provided by the interface 22 to the customer administrative system 24. In the event the previously existing telnet session from the transaction of FIGURES 3A or 3B times out prior to the file transfer 66, a new telnet session (not'shown, see FIGURES 4C and 4D) may be initiated to support the link 66.<br>
Turning next to FIGURE 4C, the database network element 26 delivered 60 search results are collected by the query oriented logic 30 (FIGURE 2) in a file (action 62). When all the search results have been delivered and the search result file is complete, the query oriented logic 30 of the interface 22 initiates (action 68) a new telnet service session connection with the originally requesting customer administrative system 24. A file transfer protocol (FTP) link 66 is then initiated, possibly using the new telnet session, to deliver the collected search<br>
results to the originally requesting customer administrative system 24. In order to initiate 68 the new session, the query oriented logic 30 must know the address of the requesting customer administrative system 24. This addressing information may be provided by the requesting customer administrative system 24 in the search request message 40 (see, FIGURES 3A and 3B) . Independent notification 70 of search completion is thereafter provided by the interface 22 to the customer administrative system 24.<br>
Referring now to FIGURE 4D, the database network element 26 delivered 60 search results are collected by the query oriented logic 30 (FIGURE 2) in a file (action 62). When all the search results have been delivered and the search result file is complete, the query oriented logic 30 of the interface 22 initiates (action 68) a new telnet service session connection with the originally requesting customer administrative system 24. Using this new telnet service session, the query oriented logic 30 sends a search complete notification 64 to the originally requesting customer administrative system 24. As in FIGURE 4C, the addressing information provided in the search request<br>
message 40 (see, FIGURES 3A and 3B) is used to initiate the link. The notification 64 includes an indication of the size of the search result file. If the customer administrative system 24 desires the file, it then sends a file transfer approved message 72 back to the interface 22. Responsive thereto, the interface 22 delivers 74 the collected search results to the originally requesting customer administrative system 24 possibly using the new telnet session.<br>
The use of a telnet session to support the file transfers 66 and 74 of FIGURES 4A-4D is not necessarily required. The FTP protocol utilized for the file transfers 66 and 74 may be initiated between the interface 22 and customer administrative system 24 without use of an active telnet session.<br>
