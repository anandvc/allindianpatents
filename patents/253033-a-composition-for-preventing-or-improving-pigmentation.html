				<td>DESCRIPTION COMPOSITION FOR PREVENTION OR ALLEVIATION OF PIGMENTATION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a composition for preventing or improving pigmentation of the skin that can prevent or improve effectively skin pigmentation. The present invention also relates to a method for preventing or improving pigmentation of the skin.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Pigmentation of the skin, such as chloasma, freckles, and the like, is a serious aesthetic problem particularly for women. Generally, the onset of chloasma and freckles on the skin is induced by the precipitation of melanin pigment formed in the skin cells when the skin is stimulated by exposure to ultraviolet light and the like. Therefore, pigmentation of the skin, such as chloasma, freckles, and the like, has heretofore been prevented or improved by the use of an externally-applied composition comprising arbutin, kojic acid, ascorbic acid, ascorbic acid derivatives, ellagic acid, 4-n-butylresorcinol, linolic acid, tranexamic acid, chamomile extract, etc., which directly or indirectly inhibit the formation of melanin pigment (e.g., Non-patent Document 1). However, these externally-applied compositions are disadvantageous in that the effect of improving the pigmentation is slow and insufficient. Ubiquinone is known to have an antioxidant action, but the effect of preventing or improving pigmentation is inadequate and is not satisfactory.<br>
In contrast, Adenosine 5'-monophosphate (hereinafter referred to as AMP) is already known to have an action for improving the pigmentation of the skin, and can be suitably used in externally-applied compositions for improving the pigmentation of the skin.<br>
However, no case to date has been reported in which a specific melanin formation inhibitor or ubiquinone is used in combination with AMP until now, and thus the effect obtained by the combined use thereof is not known.<br>

The proportion of the ingredient (s) (B) added to the composition of the invention is not limited and can be suitably adjusted according to the form of the composition, the expected effect, and the like. As one example, the total proportion of the ingredient (s) (B) is in the range of 0.00001 to 100 parts by weight per part by weight of the<br>
total weight of ingredient(s) (A). More specifically, when the ingredient(s) (B) is arbutin, ellagic acid, 4-alkylresorcinol, linolic acid, tranexamic acid, and/or salts thereof, the total proportion of the ingredient (s) (B) is preferably 0.1 to 100 parts by weight, and more preferably 1 to 100 parts by weight, per part by weight of the total weight of ingredient(s) (A). For example, when the ingredient (s) (B) is chamomile extract, the total proportion of the ingredient(s) (B) is preferably 0.00001 to 10 parts by weight, and more preferably 0.0001 to 10 parts by weight, per part by weight of the total weight of ingredient (s) (A). As another example, when the ingredient(s) (B) is ubiquinone, the total proportion of the ingredient(s) (B) is preferably 0.001 to 100 parts by weight, and more preferably 0.01 to 100 parts by weight, per part by weight of a total weight of ingredient(s) (A). In the above-mentioned proportions of the ingredient (s) (B) , the proportion of chamomile extract is calculated in terms of solid content. With the combined use of the ingredients (A) and (B) in the above-mentioned proportions, the effects of preventing or improving skin pigmentation of both the ingredients (A) and (B) are synergistically enhanced, whereby more excellent pigmentation inhibitory effects are exhibited.<br>
The total proportion of ingredient(s) (B) is, for example, 0.0001 to 50% by weight based on the total weight of the composition for preventing or improving skin pigmentation. More specifically, when the ingredient(s) (B) is arbutin, ellagic acid, 4-alkylresorcinol, linolic acid, tranexamic acid, and/or salts thereof, the total proportion of the ingredient (s) (B) is, for example, 0.01 to 50% by weight, preferably 0.05 to 30% by weight, and more preferably 0.1 to 20% by weight. When the ingredient (s) (B) is chamomile extract, the total proportion of the ingredient (s) (B) is, for example, 0.0001 to 0.5% by weight, preferably 0.0005 to 0.3% by weight, and more preferably 0.001 to 0.2% by weight.<br>
When the ingredient (s) (B) is ubiquinone, the total proportion of the ingredient (s) (B) is, for example, 0.0001 to 50% by weight, preferably 0.001 to 30% by weight, and more preferably 0.01 to 20% by weight. In the above-mentioned proportions of the ingredient (s) (B), the proportion of chamomile extract is calculated in terms of solid content.<br>

Test Example 1:  Evaluation of the pigmentation improvement effect-1<br>
The following tests were performed using colored guinea pigs  for  evaluating  the  pigmentation  improving  effect obtained by the combined use of AMP and arbutin. Preparation of a sample and production of an animal model&gt; 1.  Preparation of a test solution<br>
Using a 20% by weight ethanol aqueous solution as a<br><br>
base material, a mixed solution	of 3% by weight AMP2Na and 3%<br>
by weight  arbutin  (|3  type)	(Formulation Example  1),  a<br>
solution  comprising a  3%  by	weight AMP2Na  (Comparative<br>
Formulation Example 1-1), and	a solution comprising 3% by<br>
weight arbutin ((3 type) (Comparative Formulation Example 1-2) were prepared.<br>
2.  Production of an animal model with skin pigmentation<br>
The hair on the back of eight colored guinea pigs was shaved, and the shaved back of each guinea pig was exposed to ultraviolet irradiation several times, thereby producing four skin pigmentation sites per animal.<br><test procedure><br>
11 days after the final ultraviolet irradiation exposure for the guinea pigs, one of each test solution was applied twice per day for 14 days. Each of the four pigmentation sites of each colored guinea pig was applied with a suitable amount of one solution, from among the three test solutions (Formulation Example 1, and Comparative Formulation Examples 1-1 and 1-2) and a 20% by weight ethanol aqueous solution (control). Fourteen days later, 5 judgment persons compared the skin brightness between each pigmentation site, to which one solution, from among the three test solutions was applied and the site to which the control was applied, according to t Scheffe's paired comparison method, and graded the comparison results in accordance with the judgment criteria shown in Table 1. Table 1<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Before the application and 14 days after the application, 5 judgment persons compared the three pigmentation sites of the guinea pigs, each of which was applied with one solution, from among the three test solutions, with the pigmentation site to which' the control was applied and graded the comparison. The total of the visual grading scores for each pigmentation site obtained from each of the five judgment persons was defined as the visual grading scores for each test solution. The average visual grading scores for each test solution was calculated from eight colored guinea pigs. The delta value (A) of visual grading score was calculated by subtracting the visual grading scores before the application of the test solution from the visual grading scores 14 days after the application.<br>
A higher calculated delta value (A) of visual grading score shows that the skin color of the pigmentation site to which the test solution was applied was lighter than that of the pigmentation site to which the base agent was applied, and a higher delta value (A) of visual grading score shows that the pigmentation improvement effect is high.<br><results and considerations><br>
The obtained results are shown in Figure 1, in which<br>
the delta values (A) of visual grading scores that were obtained by subtracting the visual grading scores before the application of the test solution from the visual grading scores 14 days after the application. The delta values (A) of visual grading scores of Comparative Formulation Examples 1-1 and 1-2 were 1.00 and 0.50, respectively, and in contrast, the delta value (A) of visual grading score of the solution of Formulation Example 1 was 5.50. The fact that the sum of the delta values (A) of visual grading scores of Comparative Formulation Examples 1-1 and 1-2 was 1.50 and the delta value (A) of visual grading score of Formulation Example 1 was 5.50 clearly showed that the pigmentation improvement effect is synergistically enhanced by the combined use of AMP2Na and arbutin in Formulation Example 1.<br>
