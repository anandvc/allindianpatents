				<td>Compositions _formed of polyolefins  precess for their preparation and use of these compositions<br>
The present invention relates to stabilized compositions formed of functionalized polyolefins and in particular stabilized .compositions formed of polyolefins functionalized by carboxyiic acic. groups, their esters their anhydrides or thair metal salts, it also relates to a process for their preparation and -;o their use .<br>
Fur.ctionalized polyolefins are widely used/ in particular as adhesive between a polyethylene (PE) layer and a layer of epoxy resin, for example for the coating of pipes. In practice, all plastics are subject to oxidation phenomena  commonly described using the terminology "ageing phenomenon". The most widely used method for slowing down these phenomena i;3 the addition cf antioxidizing or stabilizing agents.<br>
Phenolic antioxidants are used as stabilizing agants for polyethylanes. However, their combination with stabilizing agents of phosphite type is generally more effective; sea US 4,250,941. A frequently used combination is  for example, a blend of pentaerythrityl tetrakis (3, 5-di--t~butyl-4-hydroxyphenylpropionate) and of tris (2, 4-di-t:-butylphanyl) phosphite.<br>
The problem which is posad in the case of adhesives stabilized in this way, basec on polyolefins functionalized by acid or anhydride groups, for example maleic-anhydride-functionalized polyethylene  is a long-term loss In adhesion. Furthermore, these compositions are subject to a loss in thermal stability and to en increase in the viscosity in the prssnance of- moisture (less in rheological stability), this phenomenon further being accelerated by an increase in the temperature.<br>
The present invention is targeted at overcoming these disadvantages by novel compositors forned of functionalized polyolefins exhibiting better thermal<br><br>
stability and better rheological stability and giving beter long-term adhesion.<br>
One aspect of the present invention consequently relates to compositions comprising one or more olefin polymers functionalized by at least one functionalization agent chosen from carboxylic acids their asters, their anhydrides and their metal salts and one or more stabilizing agens comprising one or more sterically hindered phenol groups and at most one ester functional group.<br>
These fur.ctionalized compositions exhibit better Theological stability and give better Icng-tarm adhesion.<br>
Furthermore, these compositions are no longer subject to a loss in thermal stability nor to an increase in the viscosity in the presence of moisture.<br>
The stabilising agents comprising one or more sterically hindered phenol groups and at; most one ester functional group are chosen from stabilizing agents comprising one or more sterically hindered phenol groups which comprise an ester functional group and from stabilizing agents comprising one or more sterically hindered phenol groups which do not; comprise an eater functional group.<br>
The term "ester functional group" is understood to denote, for the purposes of the present invention/ the ester functional group derived from the carboxylic acid, functional group within the conventional meaning of organic chemistry (R-CO-O-R1)-<br>
Mention may be made, among stabilizing agents comprising one or mora sterically hindered phenol groups which comprisa an ester functional group, of, for example, staaryl β- (3,5-d.i-t-butyl-4-hydroxy~ phenyl)propionate.<br>
Mention may be made, among stabilizing agents comprising one or more sterically hindered phenol groups which do r.ot comprise an ester group, of for example, 1,1,3-tris(2-methyl-4-hydroxy-5-t-butylphe-<br><br>
2, 2 -mathylerebis (6-t-butyl-4-methylphanoi) 2, 6-bis (a-iaethylbenzyl) -4-rcethylphenol,   4, 4 '-thiobis-(6-t-butyl-n-cresol)      2,2'-methylenebis(4-methyl-6-nonylphenol),   diisobutylnonylphenol,   tris(3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxybenzyl)   isocyanurate,   1,3,5-tris-(4-t-butyl-3-hydroxy-2, 6-dimethylbenzyl) -1, 3, 5-tri-azine-2, 4, 6- (1H, 3H, 6H) -trione,   1, 3, 5-triBiethyl-2, 4, 6-tris(3,5-di-t~butyl-4-hydroxyben2yl)berzene  and their mixtures.<br>
Preferably, at least one ox the stabilizing agents dees not comprise an ©star functional group. In a particularly preferred way, at least one of the stabilizing agents is 1,3,5™trinmethyl-2,4,, 6-tris-(3, 5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxybenzyl) benzene (Irganox191 133C) . In a very particularly praferred way, tha compositions according to the invention comprise 1,3,S-trimethyl-2, 4, 6-tris (3 5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxybenayl)benzene as sole stabilizing agent.<br>
The amounts of stabilising agent aciployed in the compositions of the present invention depend on various factors, for example on the an .cunt of radical initiator used, on the application intended for the compositions and on the nature of the functionalization agent. The amount of stabilizing agsr.t is generally between 0.001 and 1% by weight.<br>

extruder equipped with a series of associated blending<br>
elements with skewed threads,<br>
b)	feeding from 0.0001 to 1% by weight of a<br>
radical initiator, optionally diluted in ons or more<br>

subsequent stage of devolarilization with not .dry air in a decompression region of the extruder/<br>
f)	optionally  diluting  with  nonfuntionalized <br>
olefin polymare,<br>
g)	discharging the final composition.<br>
A screw extruder within the meaning of the pressent invention comprises at least the following parts: a feed region, a reaction region and at its outlet, a discharge region preceded by a compression<br><br>
region, the latter forcing the molten mass tc pass through the discharge region.<br>
In practic®, all the stagas Can be carried out in a corotating or cou.rvterrotating single- or twin-screw extruder which generally comprises, in addition to the aboveraentioned. regions, optionally one or more staged feed devices for the said introduction  of the pclyolsfin or polyolerins, functiona.li;:ation agents, radical initiator and/or stabilizing acent, one or more sc:rew elements allowing the propagation of the material to be extruded, one or more heating regions aillowing the constituents to be melted and one or mora devolatilisation regions. If appropriate, the composition can also be diluted in a region allowing the introduction of ncnfunctionalized po3yolefin via an appropriate feed device. In addition, the discharge region can be followed by e. graiulation device.<br>

(Vinylidenp. flroride), polyamidco and polyeslerS .<br>
The compositions according to the invention are preferably used for compatibilizlng oleifin polymers<br>
With epoxy resins.<br>
Incompatible fillers are, for example, natural fibres, such as flax, hemp, jute and cellulose, and glass fibres  glass, silica, talc, calcium carbonate and carbon black. The metal substrates are, for example, steel or aluminium,<br>
Preferred usas of the compositions according to the invention are multilayer adhesion and the multi-layesr coating of steel pipes.<br><br>
The following examples serve to illustrate the<br>
present invention without, however, limiting the scope<br>
thereof.<br>
The meanings of the symbols employed, the units<br>
expressing the quantities mentioned and the methods for<br>
measuring thase quantities are explair.ed hereinbelow.<br>
Standard  density  (3D)  of  the  polyolefin<br>
expressed in kg/m3, measured according to ISO standard<br>
1183 (1567).<br>
The melt: flow index of the polyolefin (Ml) is determined at !SOaC under a load, of 5 kg, 8/2 mm die/<br>
according to ISO standard 1133 (1:391) .<br>
The grafted content of MA is evaluated by IR spectrosccpy. Two films are preparec. per sample and analysed directly after pressir.g and then after degassing for 1 h at 120°c undar vacuum in order to remove/ if necessary, the residual frtie anhydride. The MA level/ measured by IR, is expresses', by the ratio of the absorbance of the carbonyl (1785 en"1) to the absor-bance at 3610 eafl characteristic of PI. The acid level is expressed by the ratio of the s.bsorbance at 1715 cm"1 to thfc absorbance at 3510 cm"1. The values obtained are converted to I by waight of grafted mai.eic anhydride by ma.'cing use of a relationship based on a titrimetric calibration. The frea maleic anhydride.- s detected, by the characteristic bands at 895, 840 and/or 700 cm"1.<br>
The thermal stability is determined by measuring the induction period under oxygen at 210 °C according to ASTM standard D 3895 11992, .<br>
The peel strength was evaluated on 5 x 15 cm three-layer plates. 5 x 15 x 3 nun, metal plates are sandblasted for at most 24 h befo:re coating. An approximately 100 μm layer of epoxy primer is applied at 200°C by electrostatic powdering. The plate is placed in a mould base preheated to 230"c. A £ilm of the adhaslve composition of the examples hereinbelow with a thicknese of approximately 250 ,μm is applied and then an Eltex  GTB 201 PE plate with a thickness of<br><br>
approximately 3 mm. The peel strength i.s then measured according to DIN standard 30670 (1991).<br>
In the examples which follow  ths base resin is the Eltex A 4090 P HDPE polyethylene resin with an MI6 of 29 dg/min and, a standard density sf 952 kg/m3 The maieic anhydride (MA.) is milled. Th.a peroxide is 2, 5-dimathyl-2,5~di(t-butylperoxy)hexane (D3PE-peroxyd Chemie). After grafting, the products are driad in an oven at 8C°C under vacuum for 16 h in order to remove the free MA.<br>

A sample of Eltex* A 4090 P polyethylene func-tionalied with maleic anhydride in ths absence of any stabilizing agent which comprises 1 of grafted maleic anhydride and which exhibits a melt flow index of 6.6 dg/min before and after hydrolysis, is mixed on a Brabenders mixer an 180°C, 50 rotations per minute, for 6 ruin in the presence of 3 g/kg of the stabilizing agent 1,3,5-triwethyl-2,4,e-tris (3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxybanzyl)benzene (stabilising agent A) .<br>
Half of tha sample is hydrolysecl in the presence of steam for 7 days at 100°C and then dried under vacuum overnight at 35°C.<br>
Measurements of the melt flow index and of the tharmal stability were carried out on the samples as such or on the samples after hydrolysis . The results of these measurements ara summarized in Table I.<br>
Example 2 (comparative)<br>
The procedure is the same as in Example 1 except that the stabilizing agent employed is the stabilizing agent pentaerythrityl hetrakis(3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxyphenylpropionate) (stabilizing agent B) .<br>
The results of the measurements of melt flow index and of thermal stability are summarir.ed in Table I.<br><br>

It is apparent from the analysis of the- results that the compositions according to the invention sxhibic a constant long-term melt flow index and thermal stability.<br>
Example 3<br>
A mixture of linear high density polyethylene (HOPE) sold under the tradenaine Eltstx® A 4090 P, and of maleic anhydride in the solid state, at a content of 0.4% by weight, is fad to a Krupp Werner &amp; Pfleidarer ZSK58 corotating twin-screw extruder,<br>
The extruder is arranged so that it successively comprises the following regions:<br>
(1)	Main feed region<br>
(2)	Heating region provided with a feed orifice'.<br>
(3)	Reaction region provided with a feisd orifice<br>
(4)	Degassing region for discharging the volatile<br>
materials<br>
(5)	Compression region<br>
(6)	Discharge region.<br>
The HEPS, blended with the maleic anhydride, is fed 1:0 the ir.ain feed region under «i strsan of nitrogen. The peroxide is fad to the main hopper in the feed region at a content of 0.045% by weight in the form of a masterbatch with the HDPS. The stabilising agent 1, 3,, 5-trimethyl~2,4, 6-tris{3, S-t~butyl-4-hydroxy-phenyl)benzene (stabilizing agent A) is added in the reg;.on 3 at a content of 0.3S by weight in an<br><br>
concentrated<br>
masterbatch<br>
KDPE/stabilizing   agent 10 fold.<br>
The other operating conditions are as follows: Temperature profile: 210°C Throughput of 180 kg/h Screw spead: 300 revolutions per minute.<br>
Tha functionalized polyethylene comprises 0.53 by weight of maleic anhydride and exhibits a melt flow index MI5 of 20 dg/min and a tharmal, stability of 20 min.<br>
The peel strength was evaluated as described hareinabove on the sample as such or on the sample aged for 15 days at: 80 C in water. The results of the peal strengths, measured at 23°C and 508C, are presented in Table II herainbelow.<br>
Example 4 fcomparative)<br>
The procedure is carried out ir. the way described in Example 3, except that the stabilizing agent employed is the stabilizing " agant pentaerythrityl tetrakis (3, 5-di.-t-butyl-4-hydroxyphanylpropionate) (stabilizing agent B), all the other conditions being identical,<br>
Ths results of the peel strengths, measured at 23"C and 8Q°C, are presented in Table II hereinbelow.<br>
