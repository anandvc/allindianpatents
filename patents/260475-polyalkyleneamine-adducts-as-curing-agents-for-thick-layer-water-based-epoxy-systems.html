POLYALKYLENEAMINE ADDUCTS AS CURING AGENTS FOR THICK LAYER WATER-BASED EPOXY SYSTEMS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]   The present invention relates generally to adducted polyalkyleneamine compounds, curing agent and amine-epoxy compositions derived from such compounds, and articles produced from such compounds and/or compositions.<br>
[0002]    Epoxy resins which are cured, hardened, and/or crosslinked with amine-based curing agents are well known. These amine-epoxy materials are widely used in applications ranging from coatings, adhesives, and composites, to civil engineering applications such as formulations for concrete flooring, self-leveling flooring and grouts.<br>
[0003]    Numerous waterborne (WB) epoxy resin curing agents have been developed over the past few decades. Such cunng agents can eliminate or reduce volatile organic compounds (VOCs) due to the presence of solvent in epoxy resin and hardener formulations, and the odor and environmental and health risks associated with the presence of such solvents. Many waterborne epoxy systems are also lower in viscosity than other epoxy systems, particularly 100% solids or solvent-free systems, and thus easier to apply and have level into a smooth film or layer after application.<br>
[0004]    In certain applications, it is desirable to formulate a waterborne curing agent to relatively low solids, for example, less than 40% solids, by dilution with water.  Many aqueous curing agent compositions, unfortunately, cannot be diluted without causing<br>
phase separation of the formulation, which is evidenced by cloudiness in an otherwise clear formulation. Such phase separation is undesirable as it can lead to instability of the curing agent formulation during storage.  In some cases, this problem can be addressed by diluting with water at the job site and only shortly before mixing the curing agent with the epoxy resin for use.  In contrast to formulating a particular solids content in a controlled manufacturing environment, job-site formulating can lead to inconsistent blends and the introduction of contaminants, which can cause performance problems in the end-use application. Another method to improve the stability of the waterborne<br><br>
product is to add an acid, such as a carboxylic acid. Typically, this approach adversely affects the water and chemical resistance properties of the final cured product.<br>
[0005]    It is often difficult to clean equipment used for mixing and applying WB epoxy systems or tile grouts, and the use of surfactants and detergents or solvents must often be employed for satisfactory cleaning. Once the tile grout has been applied, it is advantageous to be able to clean these systems from the tiles with water alone or with a slightly acidic water solution.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
AMINE AND EPOXY-AMINE COMPOSITIONS<br>
[0019] The present invention discloses curing agent compositions and methods of making these curing agent compositions. A curing agent composition in accordance with the present invention can be used to cure, harden, and/or crosslink an epoxy resin. Such composition comprises the reaction product of:<br>
(A)	at least one polyalkylene polyether polyol modified polyepoxide resin, and<br>
(B)	a polyalkyleneamine composition comprising a mixture of N-3-aminopropyl ethylenediamine (N3), N,N'-bis(3-aminopropyl) ethylenediamine (N4), and N,N,N'-tris{3-aminopropyl) ethylenediamine (N5).<br>
[0020]    In another aspect, the present invention provides a curing agent composition comprising the contact product of:<br>
1)       the reaction product of:<br>
(A)	at least one polyalkylene polyether polyol modified polyepoxide resin and<br>
(B)	at least one polyalkyleneamine;<br>
(2)       at least one multifunctional amine having 2 or more active amine hydrogens, and. optionally,<br><br>
(3)        an acid, especially a carboxylic acid.<br>
[0021]    Generally, the curing agent compositions have an amine hydrogen equivalent weight (AHEW) based on 100°C solids from about 80 to about 500.  In a different aspect, the curing agent composition has an AHEW based on 100% solids from about 80 to about 300, or from about 80 to about 250. Further, the curing agent composition can have an AHEW based on 100% solids from about 80 to about 125.<br>
[0022]    The relative amounts of the reaction product of the at least one polyalkylene-amine and at least one polyalkylene polyether polyol modified polyepoxide resin versus that of the multifunctional amine can vary. This vanance depends upon, for example, the end-use application, the desired properties, and the method and conditions used the application.<br>
[0023]    Additionally, cuhng agent compositions described herein can be solventless, also referred to as solvent-free or 100% solids. Alternatively, in another aspect of the present invention, these compositions can further comprise at least one diluent, such as, for example, water or an organic solvent. Appropriate organic solvents are well known to those skilled in the art of amine curative formulation chemistry.<br>
[0024]    Aqueous or waterborne curing agent compositions are within the scope of the present invention.  A water-based curing agent composition comprises the contact product of the above described curing agent compositions and water. Such aqueous curing agent compositions would comprise 30 to 80 wt% solids, especially 50 to 70 wt%.<br>
[0025]    Curing agent compositions of the present invention can be produced with various reactant ratios of the modified polyepoxide resin to the polyalkyleneamine compound. It is within the scope of the present invention for the ratio of the number of stoichiometric epoxy groups (eq epoxy) in the polyalkylene polyether polyol modified polyepoxide resin to the number of moles of the at least one polyalkyleneamine to be in a range from about 0.2:1 to about 1.5:1. In another aspect, the ratio is about 0.25:1, about 0.3:1. about 0.4:1, about 0.5:1, about 0.6:1, about 0.7:1, about 0.8:1, about 0.9:1, about 1:1, about 1.1:1, about 1.2:1, about 1.3, about 1.4, or about 1.5:1. Yet, in another aspect, the ratio is in a range from about 0.3:1 to about 1.25:1, or from about 0.4:1 to about 1.2:1. Alternatively, the ratio of the number of stoichiometric epoxy groups in the polyalkylene polyether polyol modified polyepoxide resin to the number of moles of the polyalkyleneamine is in a range from about 0.5:1 to about 1.1:1,  In a further aspect, the ratio is in a range from about 0.7:1 to about 1.1:1, or from about 0.9:1 to about 1.1:1.<br><br>
[0026]    In accordance with the present invention, a method of making a curing agent composition is provided. This method comprises adding at least one polyalkylene polyether polyol modified polyepoxide resin and at least one polyalkyleneamine compound to the other. One component, e.g., the polyepoxide resin, is added to the other slowly, over a time period generally from about 1 to about 3 hours. The reaction temperature can be between about 50°C and about 150°C . Reaction temperature can be maintained substantially constant during the addition process.  In another aspect, the reaction temperature can be between about 70°C  and about 85°C . The reaction can cause an exotherm, raising the temperature above the set point. After the addition step is complete, the temperature can be changed. The temperature after the addition step is between about 50°C and about 150°C. Alternatively, the temperature at this stage can be between about 100°C and about 130°C . The reaction can be allowed to continue for approximately another 30 minutes to about 2 hours to provide for a substantially complete reaction.<br>
[0027]    In another aspect of the invention, before the reaction product cools, at least one multifunctional amine is added to lower the viscosity and to target a desired AHEW for the curing agent composition. Optionally, water is added to reach a desired percent solids content for such aqueous curing agent composition.<br>
[0028]    Further, it can be beneficial for the aqueous cuhng agent compositions of the present invention to form single phase systems after dilution with water. For example, the present invention provides for an aqueous composition at about 20°C , wherein the curing agent composition is diluted with water to less than 40% solids to form a single phase aqueous curing agent composition. The aqueous curing agent composition is substantially free of co-solvents. Substantially free of co-solvents means that less than 1% by weight of a solvent or diluent other than water (e.g., an acid or organic solvent) is present in the aqueous curing agent formulation. Acids can be used to protonate amine groups and thereby increase the solubility of the curing agent composition in water. Non-limiting examples include carboxylic acids such as acetic acid, lactic acid, salicylic acid, and sebacic acid, or other acids such as sulfamic acid and boric acid, or combinations thereof.  Salicylic acid is preferred.<br>
[0029]    Additionally, these single phase waterborne compositions or formulations are substantially clear to the naked eye.  In another aspect, a single phase aqueous curing agent composition can be formed under the same conditions discussed above after<br><br>
dilution with water to less than 20% solids.  In a further aspect, a single phase aqueous composition can be formed at about 20°C, and substantially free of co-solvents, after dilution with water to less than 10% solids.<br>
[0030]    Aqueous curing agent compositions described herein can maintain single phase uniformity for extended periods of time, which can be required for storage of the product and its subsequent use in its intended application. Additionally, if these compositions are substantially free of co-solvents, they can have substantially no VOC's, which can be beneficial for environmental, health and safety issues, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art.<br>
[0031]    The water-based curing agent compositions also can be further modified with monofunctional epoxides, such as, for example, phenylglycidylether, o-cresylglycidyl ether, p-tert-butylphenylglycidylether, n-butylglycidylether, and other similar glycidylethers or esters. Optionally, the curing agent compositions of the present can further comprise an acid such as, for example, carboxylic acids like acetic acid, lactic acid, salicylic acid, and sebacic acid, or other acids such as sulfamic acid and boric acid, or combinations thereof. Addition of the acid functionality can increase the solubility of the curing agent composition in water.  Further, curing agent compositions disclosed herein can be blended with other commercially available curing agents and/or accelerators.  Such commercially available curing agents include, but are not limited to, water-based curing agents, which can be employed in a blend to target specific properties, such as cure rate, drying speed, hardness development, clarity, and gloss.<br>
[0032]    The present invention, in yet another aspect, provides amine-epoxy compositions. For example, an amine-epoxy composition in accordance with the present invention comprises the reaction product of:<br>
a curing agent comprising the contact product of<br>
(1)	the reaction product of:<br>
(A)	at least one polyalkylene polyether polyol modified polyepoxide resin and<br>
(B)	at least one polyalkyleneamine;<br><br>
(2)	at least one multifunctional amine having 2 or more active amine hydrogens, and, optionally,<br>
(3)	a carboxylic acid; and<br>
an epoxy composition comprising at least one multifunctional epoxy resin.<br><br>
[0033]    As another example an amine-epoxy composition in accordance with the<br>
present invention comprises the reaction product of<br>
a curing agent comprising the contact product of (1)        the reaction product of:<br>
(A)	at least one polyalkylene polyether polyol modified polyepoxide resin, and<br>
(B)	a polyalkyleneamine composition comprising a mixture of N-3~(amino-propyl) ethylenediamine (N3), N,N'-bis(3-aminopropyl) ethylenediamine (N4), and N,N,N'-tris(3-aminopropyl) ethylenediamine (N5);<br>
and<br>
an epoxy composition comprising at least one multifunctional epoxy resin.<br>
[0034]    Further, in another aspect of the present invention, aqueous amine-epoxy compositions comprising the amine-epoxy compositions described immediately above and water are provided.<br>
[0035]    The present invention also includes articles of manufacture comprising an amine-epoxy composition as described above. Such articles can include, but are not limited to, an adhesive, a coating, a primer, a sealant, a curing compound, a construction product, a flooring composition, a self-leveling flooring composition, a grout, an anchor bolt or a composite product. Additional components or additives can be used together with the compositions of the present invention to produce the articles as are well-known to those skilled in the relevant art.<br>
[0036]    The relative amount chosen for the epoxy composition versus that of the curing agent composition, or hardener, can vary depending upon, for example, the end-use article, its desired properties, and the fabrication method and conditions used to produce the end-use article.  For instance, in coating applications using certain amine-epoxy compositions, incorporating more epoxy resin relative to the amount of the curing agent composition can result in coatings which have increased drying time, but with increased hardness and improved appearance as measured by gloss. Amine-epoxy compositions of the present invention generally have stoichiometric ratios of epoxy groups in the epoxy composition to amine hydrogens in the curing agent composition ranging from about 1.5:1 to about 0.7:1.  For example, such amine-epoxy compositions can have stoichiometric ratios of about 1.5:1, about 1.4:1, about 1.3:1, about 1.2:1, about 1.1:1,<br><br>
about 1:1, about 0.9:1, about 0.8:1, or about 0.7:1.  In another aspect, the stoichiometric ratio ranges from about 1.3:1 to about 0,7:1. In yet another aspect, the stoichiometric ratio ranges from about 1.2:1 to about 0.8:1.  In still another aspect, the stoichiometric ratio ranges from about 1.1:1 to about 0.9:1.<br>
[0037]    The term "contact product" is used herein to describe compositions wherein the components are contacted together in any order, in any manner, and for any length of time including the possibility that two or more of the components may react with each other yielding other components. For example, the components can be contacted by blending or mixing. Further, contacting of any component can occur in the presence or absence of any other component of the compositions or formulations described herein. Combining additional materials or components can be done by any method known to one of skill in the art.  Further, the term "contact product" includes mixtures, blends, solutions, dispersions, slurries, reaction products, and the like, or combinations thereof. Although "contact product" can include reaction products, it is not required for the respective components to react with one another.<br>
POLYALKYLENEAMINE<br>
[0038]    Polyalkyleneamine compounds that are useful in the present invention include, but are not limited to, polyethyleneamines, polypropyleneamines, aminopropylated ethylenediamines, aminopropylated propylenediamines, and combinations thereof. Non-limiting examples of polyethyleneamines include ethylenediamine (EDA),<br>
diethylenetnamine (DETA), triethylenetetramine (TETA), tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA), pentaethylenehexamine (PEHA), and other higher polyethyleneamines. Suitable polypropyleneamines include, but are not limited to, propylenediamine, dipropylenetriamine, tripropylenetetramine, and other higher polypropyleneamines.<br>
Aminopropylated ethylenediamines and aminopropylated propylenediamines include, but are not limited to, N-3-aminopropyl ethylenediamine (N3); N,N'-bis(3-aminopropyl) ethylenediamine (N4); N,N,N'-tns(3-aminopropyl) ethylenediamine (N5); N-S-aminopropyl-1,3-diaminopropane; N,N'-bis(3-aminopropyl)-1,3-diaminopropane; and N.N,N'-tris(3'aminopropyl)-1,3-diaminopropane. Mixtures of polyalkyleneamine compounds can be employed in the present invention.  It will be recognized by those skilled in the art that polyethyleneamines containing 4 or more nitrogens are generally available as complex mixtures, most of which contain the same number of nitrogens.<br><br>
Side products in these mixtures are often called congeners.  For example, TETA contains not only linear TETA, but also tris-aminoethylamine, N,N'-bis- aminoethyl-<br>
piperazine, and 2-aminoethylarninoethylpiperazine.<br>
[0039]    In one aspect of the present invention, the polyalkyleneamine compound is EDA, DETA, TETA, TEPA, PEHA, propylenediamine, dipropylenetriamine, tripropylenetetram'ine, N3; N4; N5; N-3-aminopropyl-1,3-diaminopropane; N,N'-bis(3-aminopropyl)-1,3-diaminopropane; N,N,N'-tris(3-aminopropyl)-1,3-diaminopropane, or any combination thereof.  In another aspect, the polyalkyleneamine compound is a mixture of N3, N4, and N5 or a mixture of N-3-aminopropyl-1,3-diaminopropane; N,N'-bis(3-am!nopropyl)-1,3-diaminopropane; N,N,N'-tris(3-aminopropyl)-1,3-diaminopropane. Mixtures suitable for use in the present invention generally comprise 1-25 parts by weight of N3, 50-94 parts N4, and 3-25 parts N5; preferably 1-10 parts by wt N3, 70-94 parts N4 and 3-15 parts N5; especially 1-5 parts by wt N3, 85-94 parts N4 and 3-8 parts N5.

For example, one mole of the alkoxylated diphenol in a solvent such as toluene, dioxane, or n dibutyl ether as a 60 to 70% solution can be used. The materials are cooled to 10°C. When that temperature is reached the catalyst, BF3 etherate or tin tetrachloride is added followed by the addition in 10 min of epichlorohydrin. A small excess of epichlorohydrin based on stoichiometry can be used (5 to 10%). After 40 to 60 min reaction, the epoxy value should be 0 or very near 0 mgKOH/g, The temperature is increased to 25°C; the first one-fourth of sodium hydroxide addition is added followed by a few grams of water. Temperature is then increased to 70°C After 10 minutes the next one-fourth sodium hydroxide is added, and this is repeated until all the sodium hydroxide (1.2 moles total) is used. The reaction is then continued for another 2 hours at 70°C whereupon water is added to dissolve the formed sodium chloride. The organic phase is separated from the water layer, which is then removed until the interlayer is reached. The remaining water and the solvent are distilled at reduced pressure and elevated temperature to afford the desired diglycidyl ether derivative of an alkoxylated diphenol diglycidyl ether derivative of an alkoxylated diphenol.<br><br>

MULTIFUNCTIONAL EPOXY RESIN<br>
[0056]    Amine-epoxy compositions of the present invention comprise the reaction product of a curing agent composition and an epoxy composition comprising at least one multifunctional epoxy resin. Multifunctional epoxy resin, as used herein, describes compounds containing 2 or more 1,2-epoxy groups per molecule. Epoxide compounds of this type are well known to those of skill in the art and are described in Y. Tanaka, "Synthesis and Characteristics of Epoxides", in C. A. May, ed., Epoxv Resins Chemistrv and Technology (Marcel Dekker, 1988), which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0057]    One class of epoxy resins suitable for use in the present invention comprises ttie glycidyl ethers of polyhydric phenols, including the glycidyl ethers of dthydric phenols, Illustrative examples include, but are not limited to, the glycidyl ethers of resorcinol, hydroquinone. bis-(4-hydroxy-3,5-difluorophenyl)-methane. 1:1-bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-ethane. 2,2-bis-(4'hydroxy'3-methylphenyl)-propane, 2,2-bis-(4-hydroxy-3,5' dichlorophenyl) propane, 2.2-bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propane (commercially known as bisphenol A), bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-methane (commercially known as bisphenol F), and the like, or any combination thereof. Additionally, advanced dihydric phenols of the following structure also are useful in the present invention:<br><br><br>
OH<br>
where m is an integer, and R is a divalent hydrocarbon radical of a dihydric phenol, such as those dihydric phenols listed above.  Materials according to this formula can be prepared by polymerizing mixtures of a dihydric phenol and epichlorohydrin, or by advancing a mixture of a diglycidyl ether of the dihydric phenol and the dihydric phenol. While in any given molecule the value of m is an integer, the materials are invariably mixtures which can be characterized by an average value of m which is not necessarily a whole number. Polymeric materials with an average value of m between 0 and about 7 can be used in one aspect of the present invention,<br>
[0058]    In another aspect, epoxy novolac resins, which are the glycidyl ethers of novolac resins, can be used as multifunctional epoxy resins in accordance with the present invention.  In yet another aspect, the at least one multifunctional epoxy resin is a diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-A (DGEBA), an advanced or higher molecular weight version of DGEBA, a diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-F, an epoxy novolac resin, or any combination thereof.

The epoxy equivalent weights (EEW) for such products ranges from about 450 to 3000 or more.  Because these products are solid at room temperature, they are often referred to as solid epoxy resins.<br>
[0059]    DGEBA or advanced DGEBA resins are often used in coating formulations due to a combination of their low cost and generally high performance properties. Commercial grades of DGEBA having an EEW ranging from about 174 to about 250, and more commonly from about 185 to about 195, are readily available. At these low molecular weights, the epoxy resins are liquids and are often referred to as liquid epoxy resins.  It is understood by those skilled in the art that most grades of liquid epoxy resin are slightly polymeric, since pure DGEBA has an EEW of 174.  Resins with EEWs between 250 and,450, also generally prepared by the advancement process, are referred to as semi-solid epoxy resins because they are a mixture of solid and liquid at room temperature.  Generally, multifunctional resins with EEWs based on solids of about<br><br>
160 to about 750 are useful in the prevent invention.  In another aspect the multifunctional epoxy resin has an EEW in a range from about 170 to about 250.<br>
[0060]    Depending upon the end-use application, it can be beneficial to reduce the viscosity of the compositions of the present invention by modifying the epoxy component, For example; the viscosity can be reduced to allow an increase in the level of pigment in a formulation or composition while still permitting easy application, or to allow the use of a higher molecular weight epoxy resin. Thus, it is within the scope of the present invention for the epoxy component, which comprises at least one multifunctional epoxy resin, to further comprise a monofunctional epoxide. Examples of monoepoxides include, but are not limited to, styrene oxide, cyclohexene oxide, ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, butylene oxide, and the glycidyl ethers of phenol, cresols, tert-butylphenol, other alkyl phenols, butanol, 2-ethylhexanol, C4 to C14 alcohols, and the like, or combinations thereof. The multifunctional epoxy resin can also be present in a solution or emulsion, with the diluent being water, an organic solvent, or a mixture thereof.<br>

EXAMPLE 9 Adduct/Multifunctional Amine/Carboxylic Acid Formulation (4) [0080]    Adduct A1 (265.7g) was charged to a 1 liter glass reactor fitted with a thermocouple, a reflux condenser, and a stirrer and heated to 80°C. Diethylenetriamine/phenylglycidyl ether adduct (DETA/PGE adduct; 80 g; 0.25 mole) was added in 5 min and stirred for 10 min until homogeneous and clear. Water (345.7 g) was added slowly in 15 minutes so as not to cool the mixture too fast and stop the product diluting in the water.  Finally, 6.9 g (2% based on solids) salicylic acid were added and stirred until all the salicylic acid was dissolved. The resulting formulation at 50.5% solids had AHEW = 199; amine value = 156.5 mgKOH/g; and viscosity @ 25'C = 1480 cp.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 10 Adduct/Multifunctional Amine/ Carboxylic Acid Formulation (5) [0081]    Adduct A2 (255.7g) was charged to a 1 liter glass reactor fitted with a thermocouple, a reflux condenser, and a stirrer and heated to 80°C.  Isophorone diamine (IPDA; 42.8 g; 0.25 mole) was added in 5 min and stirred for 10 min until homogeneous and clear. Water (298.5 g) was added slowly in 15 minutes so as not to cool the mixture too fast and stop the product diluting in the water.  Finally, 6.0 g (2% based on solids) salicylic acid were added and stirred until all the salicylic acid was dissolved. The resulting formulation at 50.5% solids had AHEW = 172; amine value = 132 mgKOH/g; and viscosity @ 25X = 2871 cp.<br>
EXAMPLE 11 Adduct/Multifunctional Amine/Carboxylic Acid Formulation (6) [0082]    Adduct A3 (337.5 g) was charged to a 1 liter glass reactor fitted with a thermocouple, a reflux condenser, and a stirrer and heated to 80°C.  Isophorone diamine (IPDA; 42.8 g; 0.25 mole) was added in 5 min and stirred for 10 min until homogeneous and clear. Water (380.3 g) was added slowly in 15 minutes so as not to cool the mixture too fast and stop the product diluting in the water. Finally, 7.6 g (2% based on solids) salicylic acid were added and stirred until all the salicylic acid was dissolved. The resulting formulation at 50.5% solids had AHEW = 219; amine value = 130 mgKOH/g; and viscosity @ 25°C = 5453 cp.<br>
EVALUATION AS TILE GROUTS [0083]    SpectraLock tile grout formulation from Laticrete International, Inc. was used<br>
as comparative example. The resin system from the SpectraLock formulation and filler commercially sold by Laticrete were used with the curing agents of the present invention.<br>
[0084]    Before application the curing agent-containing tile grout formulations were diluted to 35% solids. The tile grout formulations shown in Table 1 were applied. The amounts of cunng agent formulations, Laticrete epoxy resin (EEW = 265) and Laticrete filler are in parts by weight. The HEW for each curing agent composition is also shown.<br><br><br>
[0085]    All the curing agents formulations 1-6 gave clear solutions at RT and 50 or 35% solids. These curing agent solutions were also stable for 3 months and more.<br>
[0086]    The following tests were conducted on the tile grout formulations 1-6 with the results shown in Table 2:<br>
Shore D - Measured using a Shore D hardness instrument (ASTM D 2240). Values were collected after 6, 8, 24, 72 and 168 hours. The value noted was the average of 5 to 10 measurements.<br>
UV resistance - The yellowing index was measured at various intervals after exposure of the grout to UV in damp and dry cycles. Yellowing index (Yi) was measured after 1, 7, 24, 52, 168, 216, and 360 hours.<br>
Formulation spreadability - Ease of application with a rubber squeegee.<br>
Formulation clean-up - The excess tile grout was removed using a vinegar dilution (at 50 ml/gallon). The ease of the removal was noted. Cleaning was done 1 hour after application.<br>
[0087]    The shore D measurements show that the curing agents according to the invention improve the early hardness development of the tile grout system. The ultimate shore D after 7 days seemed to converge towards values in the range of 60 to 75. Formulation 5 which is based on TETA had a slow hardness development.<br><br>
[0088]    UV exposure showed that most of the system were marginally the same none stood out as better but also none were worst that the existing systems.<br>
[0089]   'Spreadability was the same for all the systems, it felt good and easy to do. The<br>
*<br>
penetration in the joints (3mm wide) was very good. No difference was noticed between 'the systems.<br>
■ [0090]    Clean-up was also very similar in all cases using 50 ml vinegar /gallon water showing it to be a very efficient method to remove and clean the excess grout.  Using pure water was more difficult and tended to smudge the sponge. The use of soapy water was also very useful but not as efficient as the vinegar-water.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
