t, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to their use in the treatment of<br>
neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders.<br>
It has surprisingly been found that the compounds of general formula I are good inhibitors of the glycine transporter 1 (GlyT-1), and that they have a good selectivity to glycine transporter 2 (GlyT-2) inhibitors.<br>
Schizophrenia is a progressive and devastating neurological disease characterized by episodic positive symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, thought disorders and psychosis and persistent negative symptoms such as flattened affect, impaired attention and social withdrawal, and cognitive impairments (Lewis DA and Lieberman J A, NeurQn, 2000, 28:325-33). For decades research has focused on the "dopaminergic hyperactivity" hypothesis which has led to therapeutic interventions involving blockade of the dopaminergic system (Vandenberg RJ and Aubrey KR.. Exp. Opin. Ther. Targets, 2001, 5(4): 507-518: Nakazato A and Okuyama S, et al., 2000, Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents, 10(1): 75-98). This pharmacological approach poorly address negative and cognitive symptoms which are the best predictors of functional outcome (Sharma T., Br J. Psychiatry, 1999, 174(suppl. 28): 44-51).<br>
 Glutamate neurotransmission, in particular NMDA receptor activity, plays a critical role in synaptic plasticity, learning and memory, such as the NMDA receptors appears to serve as a graded switch for gating the threshold of synaptic plasticity and memory formation (Hebb DO, 1949, The organization of behavior, Wiley, NY; Bliss TV and Collingridge GL, 1993, Nature, 361: 31-39). Transgenic mice overexpressing the NMDA NR2B subunit exhibit enhanced synaptic plasticity and superior ability in learning and memory (Tang JP et al., 1999, Nature: 401- 63-69).<br>
Thus, if a glutamate deficit is implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, enhancing glutamate transmission, in particular via NMDA receptor activation, would be predicted to produce both anti-psychotic and cognitive enhancing effects.<br>
The amino acid glycine is known to have at least two important functions in the CNS. It acts as an inhibitory amino acid, binding to strychnine sensitive glycine receptors, and it also influences excitatory activity, acting as an essential co-agonist with glutamate for N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor function. While glutamate is released in an activity-dependent manner from synaptic terminals, glycine is apparently present at a more constant level and seems to modulate/control the receptor for its response to glutamate.<br>
One of the most effective ways to control synaptic concentrations of neurotransmitter is to influence their re-uptake at the synapses. Neurotransmitter transporters by removing neurotransmitters from the extracellular space, can control their extracellular lifetime and thereby modulate the magnitude of the synaptic transmission (Gainetdinov RR et al. 2002. Trends in Pharm. ScL 23(8): 367-373).<br>
 Two distinct glycine transporter genes have been cloned (GlyT-1 and GlyT-2) from mammalian brain, which give rise to two transporters with -50 % amino acid sequence homology. GIyT-1 presents four isoforms arising from alternative splicing and alternative promoter usage (la, lb. lc and Id). Only two of these isoforms have been found in rodent brain (GlyT-1 a and GlyT-lb). GlyT-2 also presents some degree of heterogeneity. Two GlyT-2 isoforms (2a and 2b) have been identified in rodent brains. GlyT-1 is known to be located in CNS and in peripheral tissues, whereas GlyT-2 is specific to the CNS. GlyT-1 has a predominantly glial distribution and is found not only in areas corresponding to strychnine sensitive glycine receptors but also outside these areas, where it has been postulated to be involved in modulation of NMDA receptor function (Lopez-Corcuera B et aL, 2001. Mol. Mem. Biol., 18: 13-20). Thus, one strategy to enhance NMDA receptor activity is to elevate the glycine concentration in the local microenvironment of synaptic NMDA receptors by inhibition of GlyT-1 transporter (Bergereon R. Et al., 1998, Proc. Natl Acad. Set. USA, 95: 15730-15734; Chen L et aL, 2003, J. NeurophysioL, 89 (2): 691-703).<br>
Glycine transporter inhibitors are suitable for the treatment of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders.The majority of diseases states implicated are psychoses, schizophrenia (Armer RE and Miller DJ, 2001, Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents, 11 (4): 563-572), psychotic mood disorders such as severe major depressive disorder, mood disorders associated with psychotic disorders such as acute mania or depression associated with bipolar disorders and mood disorders associated with schizophrenia, (Pralong ET et al., 2002, Prog. NeurobioL, 67: 173-202), autistic disorders (Carlsson ML, 1998, J, Neural Transm. 105: 525-535), cognitive disorders such as dementias, including age related dementia and senile dementia of the Alzheimer type, memory disorders in a mammal, including a human, attention deficit disorders and pain (Armer RE and Miller DJ, 2001. Exp. Opin. Ther, Patents, 11 (4): 563-572).Objects of the present invention are the compounds of general formula I per se. the use of compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts for the manufacture of medicaments for the treatment of diseases related to activation of NMDA receptors via Glyt-1 inhibition, their manufacture, medicaments based on a compound in accordance with the invention and their production as well as the use of compounds of formula I in the control or prevention of illnesses such as psychoses, disfunction in memory and learning, schizophrenia, dementia and other diseases in which cognitive processes are impaired, such as attention deficit disorders or Alzheimer's disease.<br>

Flp~in™-CHO (Invitrogen Cat n° R758-07)cells stably transfected with mGlyTlb cDNA.<br>
Glycine uptake inhibition assay (mGlyT-lb)<br>
On day 1 mammalian cells, (Flp-in™-CHO), transfected with mGlyT-lb cDNA , were plated at the density of 40,000 cells/well in complete F-12 medium, without hygromycin in 96-well culture plates. On day 2, the medium was aspirated and the cells were washed twice with uptake buffer (UB). The cells were then incubated for 20 min at 22°C with either (i) no potential competitor, (ii) 10 mM non-radioactive glycine , (iii) a concentration of a potential inhibitor. A range of concentrations of the potential inhibitor was used to generate data for calculating the concentration of inhibitor resulting in 50 % of the effect (e.g. ICso, the concentration of the competitor inhibiting glycine uptake of 50 %), A solution was then immediately added containing [3H]-glycine 60 nM (11-16 Ci/mmol)   and 25 [iM non-radioactive glycine. The plates were incubated with gentle shaking and the reaction was stopped by aspiration of the mixture and washing (three times) with ice-cold UB. The cells were lysed with scintillation liquid, shaken 3 hours and the radioactivity in the cells was counted using a scintillation counter.<br>

The amino acid glycine is known to have at least two important functions in the CNS. It acts as an inhibitory amino acid, binding to strychnine sensitive glycine receptors, and it also influences excitatory activity, acting as an essential co-agonist with glutamate for N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor function. While glutamate is released in an activity-dependent manner from synaptic terminals, glycine is apparently present at a more constant level and seems to modulate/control the receptor for its response to glutamate.<br>
One of the most effective ways to control synaptic concentrations of neurotransmitter is to influence their re-uptake at the synapses. Neurotransmitter transporters by removing neurotransmitters from the extracellular space, can control their extracellular lifetime and thereby modulate the magnitude of the synaptic transmission (Gainetdinov RR et al. 2002. Trends in Pharm. ScL 23(8): 367-373).<br>
Two distinct glycine transporter genes have been cloned (GlyT-1 and GlyT-2) from mammalian brain, which give rise to two transporters with -50 % amino acid sequence homology. GIyT-1 presents four isoforms arising from alternative splicing and alternative promoter usage (la, lb. lc and Id). Only two of these isoforms have been found in rodent brain (GlyT-1 a and GlyT-lb). GlyT-2 also presents some degree of heterogeneity. Two GlyT-2 isoforms (2a and 2b) have been identified in rodent brains. GlyT-1 is known to be located in CNS and in peripheral tissues, whereas GlyT-2 is specific to the CNS. GlyT-1 has a predominantly glial distribution and is found not only in areas corresponding to strychnine sensitive glycine receptors but also outside these areas, where it has been postulated to be involved in modulation of NMDA receptor function (Lopez-Corcuera B et aL, 2001. Mol. Mem. Biol., 18: 13-20). Thus, one strategy to enhance NMDA receptor activity is to elevate the glycine concentration in the local microenvironment of synaptic NMDA receptors by inhibition of GlyT-1 transporter (Bergereon R. Et al., 1998, Proc. Natl Acad. Set. USA, 95: 15730-15734; Chen L et aL, 2003, J. NeurophysioL, 89 (2): 691-703).<br>

NeurobioL, 67: 173-202), autistic disorders (Carlsson ML, 1998, J, Neural Transm. 105: 525-535), cognitive disorders such as dementias, including age related dementia and senile dementia of the Alzheimer type, memory disorders in a mammal, including a human, attention deficit disorders and pain (Armer RE and Miller DJ, 2001.

The amino acid glycine is known to have at least two important functions in the CNS. It acts as an inhibitory amino acid, binding to strychnine sensitive glycine receptors, and it also influences excitatory activity, acting as an essential co-agonist with glutamate for N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor function. While glutamate is released in an activity-dependent manner from synaptic terminals, glycine is apparently present at a more constant level and seems to modulate/control the receptor for its response to glutamate.<br>
One of the most effective ways to control synaptic concentrations of neurotransmitter is to influence their re-uptake at the synapses.
