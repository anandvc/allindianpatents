				<td>PINCH BOLT - SPLIT HUB ATTACHMENT ASSEMBLY<br>
FIELD<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates to an attachment assembly for<br>
connecting a hub to a shaft and more particularly to an attachment means having<br>
a split hub which is clamped to a shaft by a pinch bolt.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may or may not constitute prior<br>
art.<br>
[0003] One of the most common engineering issues encountered in the<br>
design of mechanical devices involves the choice of the attachment means<br>
between a rotating shaft and a hub of a pulley, gear, chain sprocket or other<br>
power carrying component. While there are several common and accepted<br>
means, each have factors which, in certain circumstances, recommend that<br>
means and in other circumstances militate against it. For example, while a press<br>
fit connection is relatively simple and inexpensive, it is not easily serviceable, i.e.,<br>
the components are not easily separated. Interengaging splines, while easily<br>
serviced are not resistant to joint motion and therefore subject to wear. Tapered<br>
connections exhibit no joint motion but since they are extremely stiff, they are<br>
sensitive to load relaxation. Keyed joints, while serviceable and relatively wear<br>
resistant, complicate production assembly.<br><br>
[0004] From the foregoing, it is apparent that new and improved means<br>
for positively and removably attaching a hub of any device such as, for example,<br>
a gear or pulley to a fixed or rotating shaft are both possible and desirable.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0005] The present invention provides an assembly for attaching a hub<br>
to a shaft. The hub, which may be a portion of a gear, pulley, chain sprocket or<br>
other power carrying device, includes a collar or annular wall having two axially<br>
extending relief cuts on opposite sides of a shaft opening, which define a pair of<br>
opposed projections or clamp members. The clamp members include opposed,<br>
parallel flats on the inside of the shaft opening which engage complementarily<br>
configured flats on the shaft. A threaded fastener such as a bolt extends<br>
through smooth radial bores in one clamp member and the shaft and into a<br>
complementarily threaded bore in the other clamp member. The internal flats of<br>
the hub include opposed arcuate, axially extending reliefs. The outside surface<br>
of the hub proximate the smooth bore defines a chordal surface which the bolt<br>
engages.<br>
[0006] Thus it is an object of the present invention to provide an<br>
improved assembly for securing a hub to a rotating shaft.<br>
[0007] It is a further object of the present invention to provide a hub<br>
having internal flats and axially extending relief cuts.<br><br>
[0008] It is a still further object of the present invention to provide a hub<br>
having a smooth bore and an aligned threaded bore for receiving a threaded<br>
fastener.<br>
[0009] It is a still further object of the present invention to provide a hub<br>
having internal flats which include opposed arcuate, axially extending reliefs.<br>
[0010] Further features, advantages and areas of applicability will<br>
become apparent from the description provided herein. It should be understood<br>
that the description and specific examples are intended for purposes of<br>
illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0016] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses.<br>
[0017] With reference to Figures 1,2 and 4, an assembly for attaching<br>
or connecting a hub and a shaft is illustrated and generally designated by the<br>
reference number 10. The connecting assembly 10 positively secures or<br>
connects a shaft 12 and a hub 20. The shaft 12 may be a component of a<br>
transmission or other power carrying or controlling apparatus (not illustrated) and<br>
which thus may include, for example, a male spline set 14 and a spur gear 16 or<br>
other power carrying or transferring components.<br>
[0018] Concentrically disposed on the shaft 12 is a gear 18 including a<br>
coaxial, generally annular hub 20. The gear 18 includes gear teeth 22 disposed<br>
about its periphery. Alternatively and as illustrated in Figure 3, the hub 20 may<br>
be a portion of a pulley 24 having one or more belt grooves 26, a chain sprocket<br>
having chain engaging teeth or other power transferring feature.<br>
[0019] The annular hub 20 includes a pair of diametrically opposed<br>
slots or relief cuts 28 which terminate in respective semi-circular end regions 30,<br>
one of which is illustrated in Figure 1. The pair of opposed slots or relief cuts 28<br>
define a corresponding diametrically opposed pair of arcuate flanges, projections<br>
or clamp members: a first or upper clamp member 32A and a second or lower<br>
clamp member 32B. The first or upper arcuate clamp member 32A includes a<br>
first or upper internal flat or chordal surface 34A and the second or lower arcuate<br><br>
clamp member 32B includes a parallel, second or lower internal flat or chordal<br>
surface 34B. Where the inside of the hub 20 transitions from the flats or chordal<br>
surfaces 34A and 34B to a pilot bore, a corner relief is provided to eliminate any<br>
interference (not illustrated). Centered on the first or upper chordal surface 34A,<br>
that is, bisected by a radial line normal to the chordal surface 34A, is an axially<br>
extending first concave or arcuate relief or groove 36A. The ratio of the width of<br>
the first arcuate groove 36A to the width of the first chordal surface 34A may be<br>
adjusted over a range depending on the size of the hub 20, the material from<br>
which it is fabricated and other factors. Values in the range of 1:4 to 1:7 are<br>
viewed as reasonable although certain applications may perform best with ratios<br>
outside this range. Centered on the second or lower chordal surface 34B, that is,<br>
bisected by a radial line normal to the second chordal surface 34B, is an axially<br>
extending second concave or arcuate relief or groove 36B. The same ratio<br>
relationship described directly above with regard to the first relief or groove 36A<br>
applies to the second relief or groove 36B. The first and second reliefs or<br>
grooves 36A and 36B compensate for any crown or surface irregularities of the<br>
shaft 12 and enhance intimate contact between the clamp members 32A and<br>
32B and the shaft 12.<br>
[0020] The first or upper clamp member 32A also includes an external<br>
flat or chordal surface 38 which is parallel to the first internal flat or chordal<br>
surface 34A. Extending normal to the chordal surfaces 34A and 38 is a first<br>
smooth walled, radially oriented through bore 42. The second or lower flange or<br>
clamp assembly 32B includes a second, radially oriented through bore 44 having<br><br>
female threads 46. The first smooth walled bore 42 and the second, threaded<br>
bore 44 are coaxially aligned.<br>
[0021] As illustrated in Figures 2 and 4, the shaft 12 includes two<br>
opposed external flats or chordal surfaces 52A and 52B which are just slightly<br>
smaller than and essentially complementary to the internal flats or chordal<br>
surfaces 34A and 34B of the respective clamp members 32A and 32B such that<br>
the hub 20 may be readily and easily slid onto and off the shaft 12. The shaft 12<br>
also includes a smooth walled, through radial bore 54 which is aligned with the<br>
first and second radial bores 42 and 44 in the hub 20.<br>
[0022] A pinch bolt or threaded fastener 60 or similar component is<br>
received within the first smooth radial bore 42 and the radial bore 54 and<br>
includes male threads 62 complementary to the female threads 46 in the second<br>
radial bore 44. The threaded fastener 60 preferably includes a head 64 having a<br>
tool engageable fitting such as, for example, an Allen wrench socket 66. It<br>
should be noted that the weight of material removed from the first or upper clamp<br>
member 32A to create the external flat or chordal surface 38 is preferably equal<br>
to the weight of the head 64 of the threaded fasterner 60. Additionally, the<br>
threaded fastener 60 is sized so that when installed and tightened in the clamp<br>
members 32A and 32B, its end is essentially coincident with the adjacent<br>
external surface of the second or lower clamp member 32B. This configuration<br>
improves the dynamic balance of the shaft 12 and the hub 20.<br>
[0023] It will be appreciated that a hub and shaft connecting assembly<br>
10 according to the present invention provides a positive and secure connection<br><br>
between a hub 20 of a gear 18, a pulley 26, a sprocket or other power carrying<br>
component and a shaft 12 by virtue of the pinching or clamping engagement of<br>
the internal flats of chordal surfaces 34A and 34B of the hub 20 and the external<br>
flats or chordal surfaces 52A and 52B of the shaft 12 when the threaded fastener<br>
60 is tightened. Such positive connection significantly reduces fretting, that is,<br>
component wear caused by repeated small relative movement between mating<br>
surfaces, of the shaft 12 and the hub 20. Additionally, it will be appreciated that<br>
this positive connection may be readily and easily disassembled by loosening<br>
and removing the threaded fastener 60. Relaxation of the clamp members 32A<br>
and 32B accompanying such action facilitates ready and easy axial removal of<br>
the hub 20 and the associated gear 18 or the pulley 26 from the shaft 12. Finally,<br>
although the invention has been described as a connection between a hub 20 of<br>
a gear 18, a pulley 24 or chain sprocket and shaft 12, it should be appreciated<br>
that the connection of the present invention is equally suitable for use with many<br>
other components and machine parts in both stationary and non-stationary<br>
applications.<br>
[0024] The description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention are intended to be<br>
within the scope of the invention. Such variations are not to be regarded as a<br>
departure from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br>
