				<td>CONTROL METHOD FOR COLD<br>
FUEL CELL SYSTEM OPERATION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] The field to which the present disclosure generally relates includes<br>
fuel cells, fuel cell components, fuel cell control systems, and method of using<br>
and operating the same.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] Fuel cells have been proposed as a power source for many<br>
applications, for example, as a primary power source in vehicles and the like.<br>
To meet customer expectations in vehicle applications, the fuel cell should be<br>
capable of quick start-up. At relatively high ambient temperatures (e.g. about<br>
20 °C or above) a fuel cell stack, which may include a plurality of individual<br>
fuel cells bundled together, can be started and reach acceptable operating<br>
conditions in a reasonable amount of time. In some applications, the preferred<br>
operating temperature may be around 80 °C.<br>
[0003] At relatively low temperatures, such as subfreezing temperatures of<br>
about -25 °C, rapid startup of the fuel cell stack is more difficult because at<br>
these temperatures the rate at which the overall electrochemical reaction<br>
occurs is significantly reduced. This limits the amount of current that can be<br>
drawn from the stack and the resultant heat output by the stack. The reduced<br>
output of the fuel cell stack can degrade drive-away performance of the<br>
vehicle, as well as slow the rate at which the interior vehicle cabin can be<br>
heated, the rate at which windshield defrost mechanisms operate, and the like.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0004] One embodiment includes a method of operating a fuel cell<br>
system comprising a fuel cell and a compressor that provides air to the fuel<br>
cell. The method comprises sensing a temperature indicative of the<br>
temperature of a fuel cell, providing a restriction in an air flow path to the<br>
fuel cell when the sensed temperature is below a threshold, and increasing<br>
the speed of the compressor to provide a desired air flow to the fuel cell. In<br>
at least some implementations, increasing the speed of the compressor<br>
increases the power drawn from the fuel cell to power the compressor and<br>
helps to increase the heat of the fuel cell. The increased speed of the<br>
compressor can also result in warmer air flow from the compressor that can<br>
further increase the temperature of the system components.<br>
[0005] Another embodiment of the invention includes a fuel cell system,<br>
comprising at least one fuel cell, a compressor having an output<br>
communicated with the fuel cell to provide a forced air flow to the fuel cell,<br>
and at least one flow controller disposed between the compressor output and<br>
the fuel cell and through which the forced air from the compressor flows to the<br>
fuel cell. The flow controller may be a valve or valves that provide(s) a<br>
variable restriction of the area for air to flow through the valve(s). The system<br>
may further include an air flow sensor adapted to provide a signal indicative of<br>
the flow rate of air to the fuel cell, a temperature sensor adapted to provide a<br>
signal indicative of at least one of ambient temperature or a temperature of the<br>
fuel cell, and a control system.   The control system may be communicated<br><br>
with the air flow sensor, the temperature sensor, the compressor and the<br>
valve(s) and capable of providing a signal to the valve(s) to increase the<br>
restriction to air flow through the valve(s) when the temperature sensor<br>
provides a signal indicative of a temperature below a threshold. The control<br>
system may also provide a signal to control the compressor operation to<br>
provide a determined air flow to the fuel cell even when the valve(s) reduce(s)<br>
the area for air to flow therethrough.<br>
[0006] Other exemplary embodiments of the present invention will<br>
become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should<br>
be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while<br>
disclosing exemplary embodiments of the invention, are intended for purposes<br>
of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0007] Exemplary embodiments of the present invention will become<br>
more fully understood from the detailed description and accompanying<br>
drawings, wherein:<br>
[0008] FIG. 1 schematically depicts a control system to improve the cold<br>
start performance of a fuel cell stack; and<br>
[0009] FIG. 2 is a graph of compressor pressure ratio and air mass flow<br>
rate.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0010] Referring in more detail to the drawings, FIG.l illustrates a control<br>
system for a fuel cell power system 10 such as may be utilized in a vehicle<br>
application. The fuel cell architecture and its controls may be of any<br>
conventional or hereinafter developed form. In the embodiment shown in<br>
FIG.l, the fuel cell power system 10 includes at least one fuel cell or fuel cell<br>
cell stack 12. A compressor 14 is provided and is driven by an electric motor<br>
16. The compressor 14 provides a forced air flow to the cathode side of the<br>
fuel cell stack 12, and this forced air flow may be humidified in a humidifier<br>
32, and its pressure controlled by a pressure regulator or by feedback control<br>
of its motor using an appropriate pressure sensor 46. The forced air flow may<br>
be provided to the fuel cell stack 12 through an air cooler 18 designed to<br>
reduce the temperature of undesirably heated air so that the air flow to the fuel<br>
cell 12 is within a desired temperature range for operation of the fuel cell.<br>
One or more variable flow restrictors, such as flow control valves 20, 22, may<br>
be disposed between the compressor output and the fuel cell stack 12 to<br>
control the flow rate of the air flow to the stack 12. In one embodiment,<br>
control valve 22 is provided in a bypass line 21 around the humidifier 32.<br>
[0011] In the embodiment shown, there are two flow control valves 20, 22<br>
with one valve 22 connected in parallel to the other valve 20 and the cathode<br>
humidifier 32. Accordingly, a portion of the output air flow from the<br>
compressor 14 passes through one valve 20 and then the cathode humidifier<br>
32, while a separate portion bypasses the cathode humidifier 32 and passes<br><br>
through the second valve 22. In the embodiment shown, the divided air flows<br>
converge downstream of the cathode humidifier 32 and are delivered to the<br>
fuel cell stack in a single conduit 24, although other arrangements may be<br>
utilized.<br>
[0012] In one implementation, the control system 25 may include one or<br>
more controllers 26 operably communicated with the compressor 14, the fuel<br>
cell stack 12, the air flow control valves 20, 22 and with one or more sensors<br>
to control at least certain aspects of the fuel cell power system operation. The<br>
controller 26 may include one or more discreet control units which may be<br>
communicated together, or the controller may include a single controller that<br>
controls at least the functions described hereinafter. An exemplary sensor that<br>
may be used with the fuel cell power system 10 includes a temperature sensor<br>
28 that provides to the controller 26 a signal indicative of the temperature of<br>
the air entering fuel cell stack 12, or the temperature of the fuel cell stack 12<br>
itself or the ambient temperature, or any combination of them. Another<br>
exemplary sensor may include an air flow sensor 30 that provides a signal to<br>
the controller 26 indicative of the air flow rate delivered from the compressor<br>
14 to the fuel cell stack 12.<br>
[0013] When the fuel cell power system 10 is subjected to relatively cold<br>
ambient temperatures, the temperature of the fuel cell stack 12 can become<br>
lower than its desired operating temperatures for optimum power supply<br>
operation. When the temperature sensed by the temperature sensor 28 is<br>
below a threshold, the controller 26 partially closes at least one of the air flow<br>
valves 20, 22 to reduce the effective flow area through one or both valves. For<br><br>
example, the threshold can be any suitable value below the desired operating<br>
temperature of the fuel cell stack 12. Reducing the effective flow area of one<br>
or both valves 20, 22 tends to increase the pressure of the air flow between the<br>
compressor and valves 20, 22, and reduce the flow rate. To avoid providing<br>
air at an increased pressure and a reduced flow rate to the fuel cell stack 12,<br>
the controller 26 also provides a signal to the compressor motor 16 to increase<br>
its rotational speed. In this manner, the compressor 14 requires more energy<br>
to provide the same amount of air to the fuel cell stack 12.<br>
[0014] Because the compressor 14 draws power from the fuel cell stack<br>
12, the stack has to supply additional power to run the compressor at its<br>
increased speed and pressure ratio. Because the fuel cell stack 12 efficiency<br>
may be low during cold temperature operation, additional waste heat is<br>
generated by the stack 12 to produce the extra power for the compressor motor<br>
16. Accordingly, the waste heat generated by the stack 12 contributes to an<br>
increased rate of warming of the stack 12 and subsequent more efficient<br>
operation of the fuel cell system 10. For example, as shown in FIG. 2,<br>
significantly higher pressure ratios can be used while staying below the surge<br>
line 40. At a corrected mass flow rate of 70 g/s, the compressor 14 in one<br>
implementation might operate with about 3.5 kW of power and have an output<br>
air temperature of about 13 °C under normal operating conditions, as noted by<br>
plot point 42. The compressor may operate with about 11.63kW of power and<br>
an output air temperature of about 46 °C when the air flow is restricted and the<br>
compressor pressure ratio is increased; as shown by plot point 44.<br>
Accordingly, in one exemplary implementation, the compressor 14 requires<br><br>
over 8 kilowatts (kW) of additional power to push the same concentration of<br>
oxygen through the restricted or partially closed air flow valves 20, 22 and to<br>
the fuel cell stack 12 compared to when the air flow valves 20, 22 are in their<br>
normal position for normal operation of the fuel cell system 10. And the stack<br>
12 produces an increased amount of waste heat to produce the extra power for<br>
the compressor motor 16.<br>
[0015] As noted above, the increased compressor speed and power<br>
consumption provides a higher temperature of the air discharged from the<br>
compressor 14. This warmer air passes through the air cooler 18 and helps<br>
heat the air cooler 18 and any cooling fluid therein. The heated fluid may be<br>
circulated through the fuel cell stack 12 to heat the same. The fuel cell stack<br>
12 is further heated upon delivery of the increased temperature air flow<br>
thereto. In the example shown in FIG. 2, the system can be controlled so that<br>
over 8 kW of additional power can be required to drive the compressor motor<br>
16 to deliver the same or similar mass of air to the fuel cell stack 12 during<br>
start-up compared to the power requirement without throttling down the valves<br>
20, 22. In this example, of the 8 kW to drive the motor, about 70% of that<br>
may go into the airflow, or about 5.6 kW.<br>
[0016] The control system 25 may use a feed forward model to calculate<br>
the position of or relative restriction to air flow of the air flow valves 20, 22 to<br>
maximize the compressor pressure ratio during the cold start or cold<br>
temperature operation. In some implementations, the position of the valves<br>
20, 22 may be controlled as a function of a determined or desired pressure<br>
ratio of the compressor motor 16. A compressor pressure sensor 46 could also<br><br>
be used to provide feedback control of the position of the air flow valves based<br>
on the pressure at the outlet and/or across the compressor to determine the<br>
desired position of the valves. By maximizing or increasing the compressor<br>
pressure ratio, the amount of additional energy required to operate the<br>
compressor motor 16, and hence, the amount of additional energy required<br>
from the fuel cell stack 12, as well as a corresponding increase in the<br>
temperature of the air discharged from the compressor 14, can be controlled to<br>
facilitate warming up of the fuel cell power system 10. To maintain the air<br>
flow to the fuel cell stack 12 generally constant or within a desired range, the<br>
compressor motor 16 is preferably operated with a closed loop feedback<br>
control on the air flow sensor 30 so that the compressor speed is automatically<br>
increased to compensate for the partial closing of the air flow valves 20, 22.<br>
Because the total effective area of the two air flow valves 20, 22 determines<br>
the pressure ratio of the compressor 14, the compressor control loop can also<br>
be independent of RH controls.<br>
[0017] Accordingly, by throttling the valves 20, 22 between the<br>
compressor 14 and the fuel cell stack 12, and then increasing the output of the<br>
compressor 14 so that the fuel cell stack 12 receives a desired air flow (e.g. a<br>
flow rate controlled as a function of a determined air flow rate), additional<br>
energy can be drawn from the stack 12 to power the compressor 14 and can be<br>
delivered to the stack 12 in the form of an increased temperature air flow.<br>
This improves the cold start performance and cold temperature operation of<br>
the fuel cell system 10, and increases the rate at which the fuel cell power<br><br>
system temperature is increased to thereby reduce the time of low temperature<br>
fuel cell stack operation.<br>
[0018] The above description of embodiments of the invention is merely<br>
exemplary in nature and, thus, variations thereof are not to be regarded as a<br>
departure from the spirit and scope of the invention. By way of example<br>
without limitation, increasing the restriction to the compressor output air<br>
flow may be accomplished in ways other than partially closing one or more<br>
valves, such as by directing the air flow in full or in part through a different<br>
path when the restricted air flow is desired. Of course, still other<br>
arrangements may be utilized, as desired.<br><br>
