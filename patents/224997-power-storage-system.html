				<td>Power Storage System<br>
Technical Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a power storage system intended to store<br>
and transmit power to and from a driving system of a vehicle, to thereby act as a<br>
motor or a generator. The system comprises a power storage having a stator<br>
provided with winding and at least one rotor provided with a magnetic-flux<br>
generating device. The rotor is connected to at least one flywheel intended for<br>
storage of energy in the form of kinetic energy in at least one rotary mass. The<br>
driving system comprises an electric apparatus, the power storage being<br>
arranged to transmit power to and from said electric apparatus.<br>
Background Art<br>
Power storage systems having a flywheel that is charged by a driving<br>
object and subsequently serves as source of power for, e. g., an electric motor is<br>
used, inter alia, in driving systems such as a driveline of a vehicle. However,<br>
known systems are limited, since the energy storage capacity is limited by many<br>
factors such as the weight of the system, security requirements, the availability of<br>
suitable materials as well as the availability of suitable driving systems for the<br>
recharging of the flywheel and for the discharging of the same. In a driveline in a<br>
hybrid vehicle, an energy storage is found, which, e.g., may be a battery and/or a<br>
fuel tank, an electric drive motor and/or an internal combustion engine.<br>
To be able to make use of the energy at retardation of a vehicle, for<br>
instance an automobile or a train, a fast system that manages to transmit and<br>
store high powers is required. The stronger the retardation is, the higher power<br>
the system has to be able to handle in order to make use of the energy.<br>
A known system for storage of kinetic energy is shown in US 5 931 249.<br>
The system described according to the document comprises a flywheel, intended<br>
for accumulation and discharging of energy, respectively, which is<br>
coupled to an electric apparatus operating as motor and generator, respectively,<br>
depending on whether energy is fed to or from the flywheel. When the system is<br>
used in a vehicle, during shorter periods of time the vehicle may be driven from<br>
the flywheel. The flywheel rotates at a high speed in vacuum. Together with the<br>
system described, high currents are required, which results in high losses if high<br>
power is to be handled. Thus, the known system is not suitable for high powers.<br>
Today's batteries are limited in respect of the power that they manage to<br>
carry. This entails that the charging time for battery-powered vehicles generally<br>
amounts to several hours. A battery-powered vehicle cannot be driven more than<br>
a limited range before the vehicle has to be brought to a recharging station and<br>
there be recharged during a relatively long time before the vehicle again has a<br>
certain range, frequently in the range of 100 km.<br>
Brief Description of the Invention<br>
The invention according to the present application is intended to provide a<br>
power storage system intended for storage and discharging of energy in a driving<br>
system of a vehicle that solves the above-described problems. The system com-<br>
prises a power storage having a stator provided with two windings and a rotor<br>
provided with a magnetic-flux generating device. The first winding of the stator is<br>
intended for low voltage for the transmission of energy of low. power, while the<br>
second winding is intended for high voltage for the transmission of high power.<br>
The rotor is connected to a flywheel intended for storage of kinetic energy in at<br>
least one rotary mass. The power storage system is arranged to transmit power in<br>
both directions between the power storage and an electric apparatus comprised<br>
in the driving system. By choosing to provide the stator with a high-voltage wind-<br>
ing, very high power can be transmitted in both directions in the system. Thanks<br>
to this, the system becomes very fast and manages to handle the power that is<br>
developed during fast dynamical processes.<br>
With low voltage is meant voltage below 380 V and with high voltage is<br>
meant voltage above 380 V.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, said first winding is arranged to operate at a<br>
voltage that is in the interval of 6-50 V.<br>
In a further, preferred embodiment, said second winding is arranged to<br>
operate at a voltage that is in the interval of 1-24 kV.<br>
In a further, preferred embodiment, at least one of said windings comprises<br>
a conductor surrounded by a first semiconducting layer, said first semiconducting<br>
layer is then surrounded by a layer of fixed insulation, said first layer of fixed insulation<br>
is then surrounded by a second semiconducting layer. By means of a winding<br>
having this type of insulation system, a very high power can be transmitted.<br>
In a further, preferred embodiment, In said driving system an energy storage<br>
is comprised, which may be a battery, that is connected with the electric<br>
apparatus of the driving system. Power may be transmitted from the power storage<br>
to the energy storage and vice versa. By arranging the windings in thestator<br>
in such a way that they are controlled entirely independently of each other, at<br>
every instaht a battery in a driving system can be utilized in an optimal way<br>
regarding discharging and recharging. In a hybrid vehicle being driven in the position<br>
of battery operation thereof, i.e. when the fuel engine of the vehicle is not<br>
used, for instance during driving of a bus in an urban environment, fast processes<br>
that require high power can be regulated via the power storage/flywheel while<br>
continuous energy is fed to the driving system via the battery of the vehicle during<br>
battery operation. Thus, at fast and strong retardations energy is fed to the flywheel<br>
for accumulation and is fed out therefrom when power requirement is at<br>
hand, as, for instance, at variations of torque or demands of quick acceleration of<br>
the vehicle.<br>
Further, by the fact that both windings of the stator are intended to operate<br>
at high and low voltage, respectively, the system enables energy to be fed very<br>
fas! to and from the flywheel via the high-voltage winding, as energy to and from<br>
the battery is fed with appropriate yoJtage via the low-voltage winding of the stator.<br>
The windings operate entirely independently of each other, arid therefore the load<br>
of the battery can be adapted in a way that is favourable to the condition and<br>
service life of the battery. Then, at every instant the battery can operate in a way<br>
being appropriate to the battery, while fast and power-demanding variations of<br>
operation such as accelerations and strong retardations, are managed via the flywheel<br>
and the high-voltage winding of the stator, which enables quick transmission<br>
of energy in a very short time to and from the flywheel of the system.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the flywheel is charged with energy that has<br>
been transmitted from an external source. In a battery-powered vehicle, by utilizing<br>
a driving system having a power storage system according to the present invention,<br>
the battery of the vehicle can, on one hand, be recharged in a conventional<br>
way at a recharging station, and the flywheel can, on the other hand, be charged<br>
maximally with energy. During operation, the energy accumulated in the flywheel<br>
may then be used for the propulsion of the vehicle, thereby increasing the range of<br>
the vehicle considerable, or alternatively the energy may be used for continued<br>
recharging of the battery of the vehicle. In this way, the battery may be charged<br>
continuously during a longer period of time, while the downtime at the recharging<br>
station yet becomes considerably shorter.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, said magnetic-flux generating device in the<br>
rotor comprises permanent magnets. In another preferred embodiment, said<br>
magnetic-flux generating device in the rotor comprises a squirrel cage winding. In<br>
a further, preferred embodiment, said rotor is mounted with magnetic bearings.<br>
The rotor is, in a further, preferred embodiment, mounted with both<br>
magnetic bearings and sliding bearings.<br>
In a further, preferred embodiment, said stator is air-gap wound.<br>
In a further, preferred embodiment said power storage is gyro suspended.<br>
By choosing a gyro suspended power storage, the driving properties of the<br>
vehicle will only be affected on a small scale.<br>
In a further, preferred embodiment, said flywheel comprises at least two<br>
rotary masses that are arranged to rotate in opposite directions of rotation in<br>
relation to each other. By using counter-rotating masses, the forces that arise in<br>
the system at rotation of the same are minimised.<br>
In a further, preferred embodiment, said rotor comprises a first core, a<br>
second core as well as a third core. The first winding is arranged in the air gap<br>
between the first and the second core and the second winding is arranged in the<br>
air gap between the second and the third the core. By means of this<br>
configuration, the first and the second windings are magnetically disconnected<br>
from each other and can thereby operate entirely independently of each other.<br>
The system according to the present invention may be used together with<br>
any vehicle, for instance automobile, train, aeroplane, boat. The above-<br>
described system has high efficiency, above 90 %, and reacts very fast, in the<br>
range of a few milliseconds. The system is compact, robust and durable, which<br>
is a prerequisite for use in severe environment, which is the case in most types<br>
of vehicles. The system manages to generate and absorb high powers.<br>

Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiments<br>
Fig. 1 shows a power storage system according to the present invention. A<br>
power storage 20 having a stator 24 and a rotor 21 that is connected to a flywheel<br>
22 is - via a first converter 10, a direct current transmission 13 and a second converter<br>
11 - arranged to transmit power to and from an electric apparatus 12. The<br>
flywheel 22 comprises a rotary mass 23. When power is transmitted from the<br>
electric apparatus 12 to the power storage 20, which, for instance, is the case at<br>
retardation of an electrically driven vehicle, the apparatus 12 operates as geneerator<br>
and power is transmitted from the apparatus 12 via the converter 11, the<br>
direct current transmission 13 and the converter 10 to a winding (not shown in<br>
figure) comprised in the stator 24 and is then stored in the flywheel 22 in the form<br>
of kinetic energy in the rotary mass 23. The kinetic energy stored in the rotary<br>
mass 23 may subsequently, if required, be correspondingly transmitted to the<br>
electric apparatus. Then the electric apparatus operates as motor. This system<br>
may be used in the driveline of a vehicle, and the power storage 20 is then used<br>
both as power buffer and energy buffer. The stator comprises two windings, with<br>
the first winding being intended for low voltage for the transmission of energy of<br>
low power, while the second winding is intended for high voltage for the transmission<br>
of high power. The stator's winding in which high power is transmitted is<br>
arranged to operate at high voltage over 380 V, preferably in the interval of 1-24.<br>
kV. By said arrangement, very high power can be transmitted to and from the<br>
power storage 20. Thanks to this, the system manages to handle the high powers<br>
that arise at, for instance, strong retardations.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a system having an energy storage 14 that may be a battery,<br>
a fuel cell, or other chemically stored energy such as a fuel tank of an internal<br>
combustion engine, and a power storage 20 comprising a stator 24 and a rotor 21<br>
connected to a flywheel 22 having a rotary mass 23. The stator 24 is provided<br>
with a first and a second winding (not shown in figure). The respective windings<br>
are arranged to operate at low voltage and at high voltage, respectively. With low<br>
voltage is meant voltage lower than 380 V and with high voltage is meant voltage<br>
higher than 380 V. The rotor 21 is provided with a suitable magnetic-flux generating<br>
device such as, for instance, permanent magnets or an induction winding.<br>
The flywheel 22 is intended for accumulation and quick transmission of power to<br>
and from the driving system. Further, the power storage system comprises two<br>
converters 10 and 11 having an intermediate direct current transmission 13. One<br>
of the converters, converter 11, is arranged in connection with an electric apparatus<br>
12. As in the system shown in figure 1, the electric apparatus 12 operates<br>
either as motor or as generator depending on present mode of operation. At<br>
retardation of a vehicle provided with this system, the apparatus 12 operates as<br>
generator and the generated power is transmitted via the converter 11 and the<br>
direct current transmission 13, which can operate at high voltage as, e. g., 1.2 kV<br>
via the converter 10 to the high-voltage winding of the stator and further to the<br>
power storage 20, where the energy is stored in the form of kinetic energy in the<br>
rotary mass 23 of the flywheel. By the fact that the power is transmitted at high<br>
voltage from the high-voltage winding of the stator, high powers, such as braking<br>
power at strong retardation of a vehicle, can be made use of and stored. The<br>
power accumulated in the flywheel may subsequently be used in fast processes,<br>
such as variations of torque or quick acceleration of a vehicle, when the energy<br>
from the flywheel can be brought back very fast to the driving system via the high-<br>
voltage winding of the stator. Alternatively, in the case where the energy storage<br>
14 consists of a battery, the energy stored in the flywheel may be used to<br>
recharge the battery. Then, the energy is transmitted at low power and low voltage<br>
to the battery via the low-voltage winding of the stator.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a power storage of the type that is comprised in both of the<br>
above-described systems according to figure 1 and 2. The rotor 21 is mounted<br>
with a journal bearing 25 and a guide bearing 26, respectively. The bearings may<br>
be conventional bearings or magnetic or a combination of magnetic bearings and<br>
sliding bearings. The rotor 21 is connected to a flywheel 22 provided with a rotary<br>
mass 23. Further, the power storage comprises a stator 24 provided with a first<br>
and a second winding (not shown in figure). During operation, power is transmit-<br>
ted between the stator 24 and the rotor 21, and thereby the flywheel 22 having<br>
the rotary mass 23, via one of the windings of the stator.<br>
Fig. 4 shows an embodiment of an air-gap wound stator 24. A first winding<br>
31 is arranged between first and second cores 32, 33 arranged in the rotor. A<br>
second winding 31 is arranged between the second core 33 and a third core 34<br>
arranged in the rotor. By means of this configuration, the first winding 30 and the<br>
second winding 31 are magnetically disconnected from each other and can,<br>
thereby, be controlled entirely independently of each other. The arrows 35 show<br>
the direction of the magnetic field.<br>
The stator and rotor of the power storage may be arranged to operate with<br>
either radially or axially directed magnetic flux.<br>
The invention is not limited to the above embodiments given as examples,<br>
but may be made as modifications within the scope of the general idea according<br>
