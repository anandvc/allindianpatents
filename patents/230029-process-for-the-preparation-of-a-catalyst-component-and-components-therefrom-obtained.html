PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF A CATALYST COMPONENT AND COMPONENTS THEREFROM OBTAINED<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a catalyst component for the polymerization of olefins CH2=CHR, wherein R is hydrogen or a hydrocarbon radical having 1-12 carbon atoms, hi particular, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of catalyst components supported on Mg dichloride also comprising a Ti compound and an electron donor, and also relates to certain catalyst components therefrom obtained. These catalyst components, when converted into a catalyst, are particularly suitable for the preparation of copolymers of ethylene with a-olefins due to their capability of homogeneously distribute the a-olefins along the polymer chain and among the various polymer chains.<br>
The catalysts including titanium compounds supported on magnesium halides are well known in the art. Catalysts of this type are described for example in the U.S. patent No.4,298,718. Said catalysts comprise titanium tetrahalides supported on halides of magnesium. Although the catalysts have high activity in the polymerization of alpha olefins like propylene, they are not very stereospecific. Substantial improvements to the stereospecificity have been reached by adding certain electron-donor compounds to the solid catalyst component Modern recipes for the preparation of these catalysts include first the contact between a MgCb or its precursor, with the electron donor compound and a titanium compound (usually TiCl4), and then one or more treatments of the so obtained solid with hot liquid TiCo4. Examples of such processes are disclosed among others in EP491566. These processes yield catalyst components endowed with a generally high activity and stereospecificity in the propylene polymerization but also characterized by certain drawbacks. For example it is difficult with this kind of process to finely tune the final amount of donor because the successive treatments with the hot TiCl4 take away a substantial part of it Moreover, certain classes of electron donors cannot be used with this process simply because they are not stable under the hot treatments with TiCl4. These drawbacks are particularly relevant in connection with certain kind of polyethylene catalysts that require high amount of donors to work properly.<br>
One kind of catalyst preparation able to fix high amounts of donor on the catalyst component is that described for example in USP 4,521,573 which comprises the use of a large excess of the electron donor compound that acta as a solvent in respect of MgCl2 and the titanium compound. The catalyst component can then be separated from the solution by<br><br>
precipitation or crystallization. This process suffers from several drawbacks. First, certain donors are not usable because in view of their chemical structure they are not able to act as solvents. Second, it is not possible to prepare a catalyst component with high porosity unless a substantial amount of donor is removed from the said catalyst component or the catalyst is in its turn deposited on a porous inert support In the last case however, an additional step and further materials are required with the consequence that complexity of the process and costs are increased. As a further drawback, the polymerization activity showed by these catalysts are generally rather low.<br>
In the European patent application EP 452156 a catalyst prepared according to the procedure comprising one or more treatments with hot TiCU in excess after the donor has been added, is further treated with an additional electron donor compound in the presence of a major molar amount of AlEt3. This method however, would not be viable for substantially increasing the content of the electron donor in the catalyst component because it would subject the catalyst component itself to a contact with very high amounts of a very reactive compound (AlEt3) which would heavily alter the properties of the pre-formed catalyst component<br>
It would be therefore important to have a process suitable for the preparation of a donor containing catalyst component in which the content of donor could be easily modulated and in which the catalyst component can show additional properties or retain those derivable from their essential constituents.<br>
It is therefore an aspect of the present invention a process for preparing a catalyst component supported on MgCh, and comprising the use of a Mg compound, a Ti compound and an electron donor compound (ED) selected from alcohol, glycols, esters, ketones, amines, amides, nitriles, aflcoxysilanes and aliphatic ethers as essential compounds, said process comprising two or more steps of reaction involving the use of at least one of said essential compounds as fresh reactant alone or in a mixture in which it constitutes the main component, and being characterized by the fact that in the last of said one or more reaction steps the essential compound used as a fresh reactant is the ED compound.<br>
It also constitutes an aspect of the present invention the catalyst components obtainable from the described process.<br>
In the present invention with the term "fresh reactant" is intended an amount of an essential compound which comes into contact for the first time with the reaction mixture.<br><br>
compound. This can be selected for example among Mg compound of formula MgR'2 where the R' groups can be independently C1-C20 hydrocarbon groups optionally substituted, OR groups, OCOR groups, halogen, in which R is a C1-C20 hydrocarbon groups optionally substituted, with the obvious proviso that the R' groups are not simultaneously halogen. Also suitable as precursors are the Lewis adducts between Mg dihalides and suitable Lewis bases. A particular and preferred class being constituted by the MgX2 (RnOH)m adducts in which R" groups are C1-C20 hydrocarbon groups, preferably CI-CIO alkyl groups, X is halogen preferably chlorine and m is from 0.1 to 6, preferably from 0.5 to 3 and more preferably from 0.5 to 2. Adducts of this type can generally be obtained by mixing alcohol and magnesium chloride in the presence of an inert hydrocarbon immiscible with the adduct, operating under stirring conditions at the melting temperature of the adduct (100-130°C). Then, the emulsion is quickly quenched, thereby causing the solidification of the adduct in form of spherical particles. Representative methods for the preparation of these spherical adducts are reported for example in USP 4,469,648, USP 4,399,054, and WO98/44009. Another useable method for the spherulization is the spray cooling described for example in USP 5,100,849 and 4,829,034.<br>
Particularly interesting are the MgCb.(EtOH)m adducts in which m is from 0.15 to 1.7 obtained subjecting the adducts with a higher alcohol content to a thermal dealcoholation process carried out in nitrogen flow at temperatures comprised between 50 and 150°C until the alcohol content is reduced to the above value. A process of this type is described in EP 395083.<br>
The dealcoholation can also be carried out chemically by contacting the adduct with compounds capable to react with the alcohol groups.<br>
Generally these dealcoholated adducts are also characterized by a porosity (measured by mercury method ) due to pores with radius due to pores with radius up to 0.1µm ranging from 0.15 to 2.5 cm3/g preferably from 0.25 to 1.5 cm3/g.<br>
The MgX2 (R'!OH)m adducts are generally converted into the corresponding halides through the reaction with dealcoholating compounds. The dealcoholating agent can be any chemical agent having functionalities capable to react with the OH groups. A particular group of dealcoholating agents is that of alkyl aluminum compounds. Suitable alkyl aluminum compounds are the trialkyl aluminum compounds such as for example triethylaluminum, triisobutylaluminum, tri-n-butylaluminum, tri-n-hexylaluminum, tri-n-<br><br>
octylaluminum and tris(2,4,4-trimethyl-pentyl)aluminum. It is also possible to use mixtures of trialkylaluminum compounds with alkylaluminum halides, alkylaluminum hydrides or alkylaluminum sesquichlorides, such as AlEt2Cl and AkEbCl3.<br>
It is known that alkylaluminum compounds can have a reducing activity with respect to the Ti compounds. Accordingly, if this activity is undesired, a deactivating agent, for instance O2, can be added before carrying out the step (b) and thus avoiding the reduction of the titanium compound<br>
Another group of usable dealcoholating agent is that of halogen-containing silicon compounds. Specific examples of such silicon compounds include the silicon halides having formula SiXW4-nYn, in which X and Y represent halogen atoms, e.g., CI and Br, and n is a number varying from zero to 3. The use of SiCo2 is particularly preferred. In one of the particular embodiments of the present invention it is preferred that the dealcoholation reaction is carried out simultaneously with the step of reaction involving the use of a titanium compound. Accordingly, these adducts are reacted with the TiXn(OR1)4-1 compound (or possibly mixtures thereof) mentioned above which is preferably titanium tetrachloride. The reaction with the Ti compound can be carried out by suspending the adduct in TiCl2 (generally cold) the mixture is heated up to temperatures ranging from 80-130°C and kept at this temperature for 0,5-2 hours. The treatment with the titanium compound can be carried out one or more times. Preferably it is repeated twice. It can also be carried out in the presence of an electron donor compound as those mentioned above. At the end of the process the solid is recovered by separation of the suspension via the conventional methods (such as settling and removing of the liquid, filtration, centrifugation) and can be subject to washings with solvents. Although the washings are typically carried out with inert hydrocarbon liquids, it is also possible to use more polar solvents (having for example a higher dielectric constant) such as halogenated hydrocarbons. The so obtained solid intermediate can also undergo a post-treatment with particular compounds suitable to impart to it specific properties. As an example, it can be subject to a treatment with a reducing compound for example an Al-alkyl compound, in order to lower the oxidation state of the titanium compound contained in the solid. Another example of treatment that can be carried out on the intermediate is a pre-polymerization step. The pre-polymerization can be carried out with any of the olefins CH2==CHR, where R is H or a C1-C10 hydrocarbon group. In particular, it is especially preferred to pre-polymerize ethylene or propylene or mixtures thereof with one or more a-<br><br>
olefins, said mixtures containing up to 20% in moles of a-olefin, forming amounts of polymer from about 0.1 g up to about 1000 g per gram of solid intermediate, preferably from about 0.5 to about 500 g per gram per gram of solid intermediate. The pre-polymerization step can be carried out at temperatures from 0 to 80°C, preferably from 5 to 70°C, in the liquid or gas phase. The pre-poiymerization of the intermediate with ethylene or propylene in order to produce an amount of polymer ranging from 0.5 to 20 g per gram of intermediate is particularly preferred. The pre-polymerization is carried out with the use of a suitable coatalyst such as organoaluminum compounds that can also be used in combination with one or more external donors that are below discussed in detail. As mentioned above, the intermediate product is then brought into contact with the ED compound under conditions able to fix on the solid an effective amount of donor. Due to the high versatility of this method, the amount of donor used can widely vary. As an example, it can be used in molar ratio with respect to the Ti content in the intermediate product ranging from 0.5 to 20 and preferably from 1 to 10. Although not strictly required the contact is typically carried out in a liquid medium such as a liquid hydrocarbon. The temperature at which the contact takes place can vary depending on the nature of the reagents. Generally it is comprised in the range from -10° to 150°C and preferably from 0° to 120°C. It is plane that temperatures causing the decomposition or degradation of any specific reagents should be avoided even if they fall within the generally suitable range. Also the time of the treatment can vary in dependence of other conditions such as nature of the reagents, temperature, concentration etc. As a general indication this contact step can last from 10 minutes to 10 hours more frequently from 0.5 to 5 hours. If desired, in order to further increase the final donor content, this step can be repeated one or more times. At the end of this step the solid is recovered by separation of the suspension via the conventional methods (such as settling and removing of the liquid, filtration, centrifugation) and can be subject to washings with solvents. Although the washings are typically carried out with inert hydrocarbon liquids, it is also possible to use more polar solvents (having for example a higher dielectric constant) such as halogenated or oxygenated hydrocarbons. Also in this case the so obtained solid can undergo a post-treatment with particular compounds suitable to impart to it specific properties. As an example It can be subject to a treatment with a reducing compound for example an Al-alkyl compound, in order to lower the oxidation state of the titanium compound contained in the solid. It has been already described that various donors in a wide range of amounts in respect of<br><br>
the titanium content can be used in the process of the invention. All the catalysts obtained generally show good performances in particular in the homopolymerization of ethylene and in its copolymerization with C3-C10 alpha olefins in order to produce ethylene alpha olefin copolymers containing up to 20%mol of alpha olefin. Particularly interesting are the catalyst components comprising a Ti compound and an electron donor (ED) selected from alcohol, ketones, amines, amides, nitriles, alkoxysilanes, aliphatic ethers, and esters of aliphatic carboxylic acids supported on Mg dichloride, in which the ED/Ti molar ratio ranges from 1.5 to 3.5 and the Mg/Ti molar ratio is higher than 5.5. Preferably, the ED/Ti molar ratio preferably ranges from 2 to 3.4 and more preferably from 2.2 to 3.3. Preferably, the Mg/Ti ratio ranges from 7 to 110,more preferably from 8 to 80 and particularly from 8 to 50.<br>
Preferred donors are those mentioned above. Moreover, are also preferred the aliphatic ethers and particularly the C2-C20 aliphatic ethers. The cyclic ethers preferably having 3-5 carbon atoms such as tetrahydrofiirane (THF) or dioxane are especially preferred. Excellent results have been obtained with the use of esters like ethylacetate as ED compound. The catalysts having the sad composition which are also pre-polymerized are also preferred.<br>
The solid catalyst components according to the present invention are converted into catalysts for the polymerization of olefins by reacting them with organoaluminum compounds according to known methods.<br>
In particular, it is an object of the present invention a catalyst for the polymerization of olefins CH2=CHR, in which R is hydrogen or a hydrocarbyl radical with 1-12 carbon atoms, comprising the product of the reaction between:<br>
(a)	a solid catalyst component as described above,<br>
(b)	an alkylaluminum compound and, optionally,<br>
(c)	an external electron donor compound.<br>
The alkyl-Al compound can be preferably selected from the trialkyl aluminum compounds such as for example trimethylaluminum (TMA), triethylaluminum (TEAL) , triisobutylaluminum (TIBA), tri-n-butylaluminum, tri-n-hexylaluminum, tri-n-octylaluminum. Also alkylaluminum halides and in particular alkylaluminum chlorides such as diethylaluminum chloride (DEAC), diisobutylalumunum chloride, Al-sesquichloride and dimethylaluminum chloride (DMAC) can be used. It is also possible to use, and in certain cases preferred, mixtures of trialkylaluminum's with alkylaluminum<br><br>
halides. Among them mixtures TEAL/DEAC and TIBA/DEAC are particularly preferred. The external electron donor compound can be equal to or different from the ED used in the solid catalyst component. Preferably it is selected from the group consisting of ethers, esters, amines, ketones, nitriles, silanes and mixtures of the above, in particular it can advantageously be selected from the C2-C20 aliphatic ethers and in particulars cyclic ethers preferably having 3-5 carbon atoms cyclic ethers such as tetrahydrofurane, dioxane.<br>
hi addition, the electron donor compound can also be advantageously selected from silicon compounds of formula Ra5Rb2 Si(OR7)c, where a and b are integer from 0 to 2, c is an integer from 1 to 3 and the sum (a+b+c) is 4; R5, R6, and R7, are alkyl, cycloalkyl or aiyl radicals with 1-18 carbon atoms optionally containing heteroatoms. Particularly preferred are the silicon compounds in which a is 0, c is 3, R6 is a branched alkyl or cycloalkyl group, optionally containing heteroatoms, and R is methyl. Examples of such preferred silicon compounds are cyclohexyltrimethoxysilane, t-butyltrimethoxysilane and thexyltrimethoxysilane.<br>
The above mentioned components (a)-(c) can be fed separately into the reactor where, under the polymerization conditions can exploit their activity. It constitutes however a particular advantageous embodiment the pre-contact of the above components, optionally in the presence of small amounts of olefins, for a period of time ranging from 0.1 to 120 minutes preferably in the range from 1 to 60 minutes. The pre-contact can be carried out in a liquid diluent at a temperature ranging from 0 to 90°C preferably in the range of 20 to<br>
70°C.<br>
The so formed catalyst system can be used directly in the main polymerization process or alternatively, it can be pre-polymerized beforehand especially if a prepolymerization of the intermediate solid was not carried out. A pre-polymerization step is usually preferred when the main polymerization process is carried out in the gas phase. The prepolymerizatkm can be carried out with any of the olefins CH2=CHR, where R is H or a C1-C10 hydrocarbon group. In particular, it is especially preferred to pre-polymerize ethylene or propylene or mixtures thereof with one or more of-olefins, said mixtures containing up to 20% in moles of oolefin, forming amounts of polymer from about 0.1 g per gram of solid component up to about 1000 g per gram of solid catalyst component The pre-polymerization step can be carried out at temperatures from 0 to 80°C, preferably from 5 to 70°C, in the liquid or gas phase. The pre-polymerization step can be performed in-line as a part of a continuous<br><br>
polymerization process or separately in a batch process. The batch pre-polymerization of the catalyst of the invention with ethylene or propylene in order to produce an amount of polymer ranging from 0.5 to 20 g per gram of catalyst component is particularly preferred. The pre-polymerized catalyst component can also be subject to a further treatment with a titanium compound before being used in the main polymerization step. In this case the use of TiCU is particularly preferred. The reaction with the Ti compound can be carried out by suspending the prepolymerized catalyst component in the liquid Ti compound optionally in mixture with a liquid diluent; the mixture is heated to 60-120°C and kept at this temperature for 0.5-2 hours.<br>
Examples of gas-phase processes wherein it is possible to use the catalysts of the invention are described in WO 92/21706, USP 5,733,987 and WO 93/03078. These processes comprise a pre-contact step of the catalyst components, a pre-polymerization step and a gas phase polymerization step in one or more reactors in a series of fluidized or mechanically stirred bed. In a particular embodiment, the gas-phase process can be suitably carried out according to the following steps: (i)       contacting the catalyst components (a), (b) and optionally (c) for a period of time<br>
ranging from 0.1 to 120 minutes, at a temperature ranging from 0 to 90°C;<br>
optionally (ii)      pre-polymerizing with one or more olefins of formula CH2=CHR, where R is H or a<br>
C1-C10 hydrocarbon group, up to forming amounts of polymer from about 0.1 up to<br>
about 1000 g per gram of solid catalyst component (a); and (iii)     polymerizing in the gas-phase ethylene, or mixtures thereof with a-olefins<br>
CH2=CHR in which R is a hydrocarbon radical having 1-10 carbon atoms, in one or more fluidized or mechanically stirred bed reactors, in the presence of the product coming from (i) or (ii). As already mentioned, the catalysts of the present invention are particularly suitable for preparing linear low density polyethylenes (LLDPE, having a density lower than 0.940 g/cm3) and very-low-density and ultra-low-density polyethylenes (VIDPE and ULDPE, having a density lower than 0.920 g/cm3, to 0.880 g/cm3) consisting of copolymers of ethylene with one or more alpha-olefins having from 3 to 12 carbon atoms, having a mole content of units derived from ethylene of higher than 80%. However, they can also be used to prepare a broad range of polyolefin products including, for example, high density ethylene polymers (HDPE, having a density higher than 0.940 g/cm3), comprising ethylene<br><br>
homopolymers and copolymers of ethylene with alpha-olefins having 3-12 carbon atoms;<br>
elastomeric copolymers of ethylene and propylene and elastomeric teipolymers of ethylene<br>
and propylene with smaller proportions of a diene having a content by weight of units<br>
derived from ethylene of between about 30 and 70%; isotactic polypropylenes and<br>
crystalline copolymers of propylene and ethylene and/or other alpha-olefins having a<br>
content of units derived from propylene of higher than 85% by weight; impact resistant<br>
polymers of propylene obtained by sequential polymerization of propylene and mixtures of<br>
propylene with ethylene, containing up to 30% by weight of ethylene; copolymers of<br>
propylene and 1-butene having a number of units derived from 1-butene of between 10 and<br>
40% by weight<br>
The following examples are given in order to further describe the present invention in a<br>
non-limiting manner.<br>
CHARACTERIZATION<br>
The properties are determined according to the following methods:<br>
Melt Index: measured at 190°C according to ASTM D-1238 condition "E" (load of 2.16<br>
Kg) and "F" (load of 21.6 Kg);<br>
Fraction soluble in xylene. The solubility in xylene at 25°C was determined according to<br>
the following method: About 2.5 g of polymer and 250 ml of o-xylene were placed in a<br>
round-bottomed flask provided with cooler and a reflux condenser and kept under<br>
nitrogen. The mixture obtained was heated to 135°C and was kept under stirring for about<br>
60 minutes. The final solution was allowed to cool to 25°C under continuous stirring, and<br>
was then filtered. The filtrate was then evaporated in a nitrogen flow at 140°C to reach a<br>
constant weight. The content of said xylene-soluble fraction is expressed as a percentage<br>
of the original 2.5 grams.<br>
Comonomer content<br>
1-Butene was determined via Infrared Spectrometry.<br>
The a-olefins higher than 1-butene were determined via Infra-Red analysis.<br>
Effective density: ASTM-D 1505<br>
Thermal analysis: Calorimetric measurements were performed by using a differential<br>
scanning calorimeter DSC Perkin-Elmer. The instrument is calibrated with indium and tin<br>
standards. The weighted sample (5-10 mg), obtained from the Melt Index determination,<br>
was sealed into aluminum pans, thermostatted at 5°C for 3 minutes, heated to 200°C at<br>
20°C/min and kept at that temperature for a time long enough (5 minutes) to allow a<br><br>
complete melting of all the crystallites. Successively, after cooling at 20°C/min to -20°C,<br>
the peak temperature was assumed as crystallization temperature (Tc). After standing 5<br>
minutes at 0°C, the sample was heated to 200°C at a rate of 20°C/min. in this second<br>
heating run, the peak temperature was assumed as melting temperature (Tm) and the area as<br>
the global melting enthalpy (AH).<br>
Determination of Mg. Ti: has been carried out via inductively coupled plasma emission<br>
spectroscopy (ICP).<br>
Determination of CI: has been carried out via potentiometric titration.<br>
Determination of ED: via Gas-Chromatography analysis<br>
