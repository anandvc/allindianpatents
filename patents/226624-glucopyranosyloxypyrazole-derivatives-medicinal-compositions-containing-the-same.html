GLUCOPYRANOSYLOXYPYRAZOLE DERIVATIVES,<br>
MEDICINAL COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THE SAME<br>
AND INTERMEDIATES IN THE PRODUCTION THEREOF<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to glucopyranosyloxy-pyrazole derivatives or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, which are useful as medicaments, pharmaceutical compositions comprising the same and intermediates thereof.<br>
Background Art<br>
Diabetes is one of lifestyle-related diseases with the background of change of eating habit and lack of exercise. Hence, diet and exercise therapies are performed in patients with diabetes.  Furthermore, when its sufficient control and continuous performance are difficult, drug treatment is simultaneously performed. Now, biguanides , sulfonylureas and insulin sensitivity enhancers have been employed as antidiabetic agents.  However, biguanides and sulfonylureas show occasionally adverse effects such as lactic acidosis and hypoglysemia, respectively.  In a case of using insulin sensitivity enhancers, adverse effects such as edema occasionally are observed, and it is also concerned for advancing obesity. Therefore, in order to solve these problems , it has been desired to develop antidiabetic agents having a new mechanism.<br>
In recent years, development of new type antidiabetic agents has been progressing, which promote urinary glucose excretion and lower blood glucose level by preventing excess glucose reabsorption at the kidney (J. Clin. Invest., Vol.79, pp.1510-1515 (1987)).  In addition, it is reported that SGLT2 (NaVglucose cotransporter 2) is present in the SI segment of the kidney's proximal tubule and participates mainly in reabsorption of glucose filtrated through glomerular (J. Clin. Invest., Vol.93, pp.397-404 (1994)). Accordingly, inhibiting a human SGLT2 activity prevents reabsorption of excess glucose at the kidney, subsequently promotes excreting excess glucose though the urine, and normalizes blood glucose level. Therefore, fast development of antidiabetic agents, which have a potent inhibitory activity in human SGLT2 and have a new mechanism, has been desired. Also, since such agents promote the excretion of excess glucose though the urine and consequently the glucose accumulation in the body is decreased, they are also expected to have a preventing or alleviating effect on obesity.<br>
As compounds having pyrazole moiety, it is described that WAY-123783 increased an amount of excreted glucose in normal mice. However, its effects in human are not described at all (J. Med. Chem., Vol. 39, pp. 3920-3928 (1996)).<br>

Test Example 1<br>
Assay for inhibitory effect on human SGLT2 activity 1) Construction of the plasmid vector expressing human SGLT2 Preparation of the cDNA library for PCR amplification was performed by reverse transcription of a total RNA deprived from human kidney (Ori gene) with oligo dT as the primer, using Super Script preamplification system (Gibco-BRL: LIFE TECHNOLOGIES) . The DNA fragment coding for human SGLT2 was amplified by the PCR reaction, in which the human kidney cDNA library described above was used as the template and the following oligo nucleotides 0702F and 0712R, presented as sequence number 1 and 2 respectively, were used as the primers. The amplified DNA fragment was ligated into pCR (Invitrogen) , a vector for cloning, according to standard method of the kit. The Escherichia coli HB101 was transformed according to usual method and then selection of the transformants was performed on the LB agar medium containing 50 µg/mL of kanamycin. After plasmid DNA was extracted and purified from the one of the transformants, amplifying of the DNA fragment coding for human SGLT2 was performed by the PCR reaction, in which the following oligo nucleotides 0714F and 0715R, presented as sequence number 3 and<br>
4 respectively, were used as the primers. The amplified DNA fragment was digested with restriction enzymes, Xho I and Hind III, and then purified with Wizard purification System (Promega) .  This purified DNA fragment was inserted at into the corresponding restriction sites of pcDNA3.1 (-) Myc/His-B (Invitrogen), a vector for expressing of fusion protein. The Escherichia coli HB101 was transformed according to usual method and then selection of the transformant was performed on the LB agar medium containing 50 µg/mL of ampicillin. After plasmid DNA was extracted and purified from this transf ormant, the base sequence of the DNA fragment inserted at the multi-cloning sites of the vector pcDNAS.1 (-) Myc/His - B was analyzed. This clone had a single base substitution (ATC which codes for the isoleucine-433 was substituted by GTC) compared with the human SGLT2 reported by Wells et al (Am. J. Physiol. , Vol. 263, pp. 459-465 (1992)).  Sequentially, a clone in which valine is substituted for isoleucine-433 was obtained. This plasmid vector expressing human SGLT2 in which the peptide presented as sequence number 5 is fused to the carboxyl terminal alanine residue was designated KL29.<br>

2) Preparation of the cells expressing transiently human SGLT2 KL29 , the plasmid expressing human SGLT2 , was transf ected into COS-7 cells (RIKEN CELL BANK RCB0539) by electroporation. Electroporation was performed with GENE PULSER II (Bio-Rad Laboratories) under the condition: 0.290 kV, 975 µF, 2 x 106 cells of COS-7 cell and 20 µg of KL29 in 500 (XL of OPTI-MEM I medium (Gibco-BRL: LIFE TECHNOLOGIES) in the 0 . 4 cm type cuvette. After the gene transfer, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended with OPTI-MEM I medium (ImL/cuvette) . To each well in 96-wells plate, 125 µL of this cell suspension was added. After overnight culture at 37°C under 5 % C02, 125 µL of DMEM medium which is containing 10 % of fetal bovine serum (Sanko Jyunyaku), 100 units/mL sodium penicillin G (Gibco-BRL: LIFE TECHNOLOGIES), 100 µg/mL streptomycin sulfate (Gibco-BRL: LIFE TECHNOLOGIES) was added to each well.  These cells were cultured until the next day and then they were used for the measurement of the inhibitory activity against the uptake of methyl-α-D-glucopyranoside.<br>
3) Measurement of the inhibitory activity against the uptake<br>
of methyl-α-D-glucopyranoside<br>
After a test compounds was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and diluted with the uptake buffer (a pH 7.4 buffer containing 140 mM sodium chloride, 2 mM potassium chloride, 1 mM calcium chloride, 1 mM magnesium chloride, 5 mM methyl-a-D-glucopyranoside, 10 mM 2-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethane sulfonic acid and 5 mM tris(hydroxy-<br>
methyl) aminomethane) , each diluent was used as test sample for measurement of the inhibitory activity. After removal of the medium of the COS-7 cells expressing transiently human SGLT2, to each well 200 µL of the pretreatment buffer (a pH 7.4 buffer containing 140 mM choline chloride, 2 mM potassium chloride, 1 mM calcium chloride, 1 mM magnesium chloride, 10 mM 2-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethane sulfonic acid and 5 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane) was added, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 10 minutes. After the pretreatment buffer was removed, 200 µL of the same buffer was added again, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 10 minutes . The buffer for measurement was prepared by adding of 7 µL of methyl-a-D- (U-14C) glucopyranoside( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to 525 [J.L of the prepared test sample.  For the control, the buffer for measurement without test compound was prepared. For estimate of the basal uptake in the absence of test compound and sodium, the buffer for measurement of the basal uptake, which contains 140 mM choline chloride in place of sodium chloride, was prepared similarly. After the pretreatment buffer was removed, 75 µL of the each buffer for measurement was added to each well, the cells were incubated at 37°C for 2 hours.  After the buffer for measurement was removed, 200 µL of the washing buffer (a pH 7.4 buffer containing 140 mM choline chloride, 2 mM potassium chloride, 1 mM calcium chloride, 1 mM magnesium chloride, 10 mM methyl-α-D-glucopyranoside , 10 mM 2- [ 4- ( 2-hydroxyethyl) -1-piperazinyl]ethane sulfonic acid and 5 mM tris(hydroxy-methyl)aminomethane)was added to each well and immediately<br>
removed. After two additional washing, the cells were solubilized by addition of 75 µL of 0.2 N sodium hydroxide to each well. After the cell lysates were transferred to the PicoPlate (Packard) and 150 µL of MicroScint-40 (Packard) was added to each well, the radioactivity was measured with microplate scintillation counter TopCount (Packard).  The difference in uptake was obtained as 100 % value by subtracting the radioactivity in the basal uptake from that in control and then the concentrations at which 50 % of uptake were inhibited (IC50) were calculated from the concentration-inhibition curve by least square method. The results are shown in the following Table 1.<br>

Test Example 2<br>
Assay for the facilitatory effect on urinary glucose excretion<br>
Method A)<br>
As experimental animal, overnight fasted SD rats (SLC, male, 5 weeks of age, 120-150g) were used. Test compound (25 . 40 mg) was suspended in 762 µL of ethanol and dissolved by adding of 3.048 mL of polyethylene glycol 400 and 3.81 mL of saline and then 3.3 mg/mL solution was prepared. A part of this solution was diluted with the solvent (saline: polyethylene glycol 400: ethanol = 5: 4: 1) and then each solution at the concentration of 3.3, 1 or 0.33 (mg/mL) was prepared.  Each of these solutions was subcutaneously administrated to the rats at the dose of 3 mL/kg (10, 3 and 1 mg/kg).  For the control, just only the solvent (saline: polyethylene glycol 400: ethanol = 5: 4: 1) was subcutaneously administrated at the dose of 3 mL/kg.  Immediately after this subcutaneous administration, 200 g/L glucose solution was orally administered at the dose of 10 mL/kg (2 g/kg).  The subcutaneous administration was performed with 26G needle and 1 mL syringe.  The oral administration was performed with gastric tube for rat and 2. 5 mL syringe. The head count in one group was 3. Collection of urine was performed in metabolic cage after these administrations were finished. The sampling time for collection of urine was 4 hours after the glucose administration. After collection of urine was finished, the urine volume was recorded and the urinary glucose concentration was measured.<br>
The glucose concentration was measured with a kit for laboratory test: Glucose B-Test WAKO (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.). The amount of urinary glucose excretion in 4 hours per 1 body was calculated from urine volume and urinary glucose concentration.<br>
Method B)<br>
