				<td>Method for controlling a compressed air installation<br>
comprising several compressors, control box applied thereby<br>
and compressed air installation applying this method.<br>
The present invention concerns a method for controlling a<br>
compressed air installation comprising several compressors .<br>
Such compressed air installations comprising several<br>
compressors are already known, whereby one or two different<br>
types of compressors at the most are combined, which<br>
compressors are connected to a single compressed air<br>
network with their respective outlets and which are<br>
switched on and off in cascade, each at a different<br>
switching pressure in order to prevent that several<br>
compressors would be switched on and off simultaneously,<br>
which would result in enormous fluctuations in the<br>
compressed air network.<br>
Such a method for controlling the compressors in a<br>
compressed air installation comprising several compressors<br>
is disadvantageous in that the overall flow and the<br>
pressure in the compressed air network may nevertheless<br>
still undergo large fluctuations.<br>
A related disadvantage is that, due to the large pressure<br>
fluctuations in the compressed air network, the average<br>
pressure is relatively large in relation to the required<br>
minimum pressure, which results in a large consumption of<br>
energy and in larger leakage losses in the compressed air<br>
network.<br>
Another disadvantage of the known method is that the above-<br>
mentioned control does not take the optimal working<br>
conditions of every separate compressor into account, and<br>
that the compressors often operate outside their optimal<br>
working domain, where they consume much more energy,<br>
comparatively speaking, and wear much faster.<br>
Another disadvantage is that switching the compressors on<br>
and off each time is disadvantageous to the power<br>
consumption and to the life span of the compressors<br>
concerned.<br>
An additional disadvantage is that such a method is not<br>
suitable for combining more than two different types of<br>
compressors in a single compressed air installation.<br>
The present invention aims to provide a solution to the<br>
above-mentioned and other disadvantages by providing a<br>
method which makes it possible to control a compressed air-<br>
installation with one, two or three different types of<br>
compressors in order to obtain a pressure adjustment around<br>
an average set value and within a very narrow margin<br>
between a set minimum pressure and a set maximum pressure,<br>
such that the average pressure is situated relatively close<br>
to the minimum pressure, which is advantageous to the<br>
energy consumption and the losses of air via leaks in the<br>
compressed air installation.<br>
To this end, the invention concerns a method for adjusting<br>
a compressed air installation with several compressors,<br>
which compressed air installation mainly consists of two or<br>
more electrically driven compressors of what is called the<br>
'loaded/unloaded' compressor type and/or of the turbo<br>
compressor type and/or of the compressor type with variable<br>
rotational speed, whereby these compressors are connected<br>
to a single compressed air network with their outlets, and<br>
whereby each compressor is provided with one or several<br>
control units, whereby the method makes use of a control<br>
box onto which is connected a pressure sensor of the above-<br>
mentioned compressed air network, which control box makes<br>
it possible to adjust the pressure in the above-mentioned<br>
compressed air network around a target pressure to be set<br>
and within a pressure interval which is limited by a<br>
minimum pressure to be set and a maximum pressure to be<br>
set, whereby the above-mentioned adjustment takes place by<br>
controlling the flow of one or several of the above-<br>
mentioned compressors, in particular in order to increase<br>
the overall flow supplied by the compressors when the<br>
pressure drops too much and in order to lower the overall<br>
supplied flow when the pressure becomes too high.<br>
Preferably, an evaluation table is stored in the memory of<br>
the control box beforehand for every compressor or for<br>
every type of compressor of the compressed air<br>
installation, whereby for every working condition of the<br>
compressor concerned, the influence of an aforesaid control<br>
order is assessed, and whereby for every control order of<br>
the compressor concerned, a score is given which is<br>
positive when the influence of said order is advantageous<br>
to the output of the compressed air installation, and. which<br>
is negative when the aforesaid influence is disadvantageous<br>
and whose absolute value is all the greater as the<br>
advantageous or disadvantageous influence is bigger.<br>
In this manner, on the basis of said evaluation table, it<br>
is possible to check what control order has the highest<br>
score at any time as far as output of the compressed air<br>
installation is concerned, and it is possible to determine<br>
this best score by means of an algorithm, and to have the<br>
corresponding control order carried out by the control box.<br>
The invention also concerns a control box for adjusting a<br>
compressed air installation comprising one or several<br>
compressors according to the method of the invention, which<br>
control box is mainly provided with connections to one or<br>
several control units of the compressors and with a<br>
pressure sensor of the compressed air installation; a<br>
memory in which can be stored an evaluation table with<br>
scores to be inputted by the user; an arithmetic unit with<br>
an algorithm which makes it possible to compare the<br>
aforesaid scores and to give a control order as a function<br>
of the highest selected score.<br>
Moreover, the invention also concerns a compressed air<br>
installation applying the method according to the invention<br>
and which mainly consists of one or several compressors of<br>
what is called the 'loaded/unloaded' type; one or several<br>
compressors of the turbo compressor type; one or several<br>
compressors of the type with a variable rotational speed,<br>
whereby these compressors are each connected to a single<br>
compressed air network with their outlets, and whereby each<br>
compressor is provided with one or several control units<br>
and a pressure sensor; and finally a control box which is<br>
connected to one or several of the above-mentioned control<br>
units and to the above-mentioned pressure sensor.<br>
Such a compressed air installation with three different<br>
types of compressors offers the advantage that the pressure<br>
and the output can be adjusted very precisely.<br>
In order to better explain the characteristics of the<br>
invention, two preferred compressed air installations<br>
according to the invention are described as an example only<br>
without being limitative in any way, as well as a preferred<br>
application of the method according to the invention, with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
figure 1 schematically represents a compressed air<br>
installation comprising several compressors which<br>
makes it possible to apply the method according to the<br>
invention;<br>
figures 2 and 3 respectively represent the operational<br>
curves of the compressors which are indicated by F2<br>
and F3 respectively in figure 1;<br>
figure 4 represents the development of the pressure as<br>
a function of time;<br>
figure 5 represents a variant of figure 1.<br>
In figure 1, a compressed air installation 1 is represented<br>
by way of example comprising three different compressors,<br>
in particular a first compressor 2 of the 'loaded/unloaded'<br>
type, a second compressor 3 of the turbo type and a third<br>
compressor 4 of the type with a variable rotational speed,<br>
whereby these compressors are connected to a single<br>
compressed air network. 8 with their respective outlets 5-6-<br>
The compressor 2 of the 'loaded/unloaded' type in this case<br>
consists of a compressor element 9 which is coupled to an<br>
electric motor 10.<br>
In the inlet of the compressor element 9 is provided a<br>
controlled inlet valve 11 with an open and a closed<br>
position, whereas a controlled exhaust valve 12 is provided<br>
in the exhaust 5 with an outlet 13 which opens into the<br>
ambient air.<br>
The motor 10, the inlet valve 11 and the exhaust valve 12<br>
are connected to a control element 15 by means of electric<br>
conductors 14 which can give control orders to start the<br>
motor 10 and to stop it, and to open and close the inlet<br>
valve 11 and to put the exhaust valve 12 in a specific<br>
position in order to make the compressor work in a loaded,<br>
respectively unloaded manner.<br>
This compressor 2 has three possible operational modes,<br>
namely standstill, loaded and unloaded operation.<br>
The control element 15 receives a number of signals 16 from<br>
certain probes and meters which are not represented in the<br>
figures for clarity's sake and which measure for example<br>
the rotational speed, the electric power absorbed by the<br>
motor 10, the pressure and the temperature at the outlet 5<br>
and the like.<br>
The turbo type compressor 3 consists of a compressor-<br>
element 17 which is coupled to an electric motor 18.<br>
In the inlet of the compressor 3 is provided a controlled,<br>
inlet valve 19 having an open and a closed position,<br>
whereas an exhaust valve 20 is provided in the outlet 6<br>
having a free exit 21 in the ambient air.<br>
The compressor 3 is provided with a control element 2 2<br>
which is electrically connected to the motor 18 and to the<br>
inlet valve 19 and exhaust valve 17 by means of conductors<br>
14, whereby said control element 22 can give the necessary<br>
control orders to start and stop the motor 16, to open and<br>
close the inlet valve 19 and to put the exhaust valve 2 0 in<br>
a specific position.<br>
Figure 2 represents the operational curve of said<br>
compressor 3, which curve represents what is called the<br>
specific consumption SE, or in other words the absorbed<br>
energy per unit of supplied pneumatic power, as a function<br>
of the supplied air flow Q.<br>
The smaller the specific consumption SE, the better the<br>
output of the compressor will be.<br>
As is clear from figure 2, the compressor 3 can operate<br>
between two utmost operational points A and B, whereby to<br>
the left of this operational area A-B, the exhaust valve 2 0<br>
is open, whereas inside the operational area A-B the flow<br>
is determined by the position of the inlet valve 19.<br>
In an analogous manner as the control element 15, the<br>
control element 22 is provided with a number of measuring<br>
signals 23 related to the rotational speed, absorbed power<br>
and the like of the compressor 3.<br>
The compressor 4 of the variable speed type comprises a<br>
compressor element 24 which is coupled to an electric motor<br>
25 which is connected to a control element 26 by means of<br>
electric conductors 14, provided for example with a<br>
frequency control to be able to adjust the rotational speed<br>
of the motor 2 5 in a continuous manner and to be able to<br>
start and to stop the motor 25.<br>
Figure 3 represents the operational curve of this<br>
compressor 4 with a working domain situated between the<br>
points C and D, whereby the working points inside this<br>
domain C-D can be obtained by controlling the rotational<br>
speed of the motor 25.<br>
In practice, the aim is to have the compressor work in the<br>
central working zone E-F, where the specific consumption is<br>
the lowest and in any case much lower than in the less<br>
advantageous working zones C-E and F-D.<br>
The control element 26 receives certain measuring signals<br>
27, such as the rotational speed of the motor 25, the<br>
absorbed power and the like.<br>
The compressed air installation 1 is further provided with<br>
a control box 28 according to the invention, whereby this<br>
control box 28 is connected to the above-mentioned control<br>
elements 15, 22 and 2 by means of connections 2 8 which can<br>
be realised by means of electric conductors, by a<br>
connection in a local area network (LAN) , by a wireless<br>
connection or the like.<br>
The control box 28 has a memory 29 and an arithmetic unit<br>
3 0 and is in this case connected to a computer 31 or the<br>
like, whereby this computer 31 can be connected either<br>
directly or via a communication network, such as the<br>
internet or the like.<br>
In the compressed area network 8 is provided a pressure<br>
sensor 32 which is connected to the control box 28 via the<br>
connection 33.<br>
The method according to the invention will be explained<br>
hereafter by means of a few theoretical examples.<br>
When starting the compressed air installation 1, an<br>
evaluation table is established whereby, for all the above-<br>
mentioned control orders of the compressors 2-3-4, for all<br>
or for certain operational situations, a score is given<br>
which is a measure for the influence which said control<br>
order has on the output and thus on the energy consumption<br>
of the compressed air installation 1, whereby for example a<br>
positive score is given for a favourable influence, and a<br>
negative score is given for an unfavourable influence, and<br>
whereby the score is all the higher as the influence is<br>
larger.<br>
Examples of such scores for starting the compressors 2-3-4<br>
are as follows:<br>
score -50 for starting a compressor 2 of the<br>
'loaded/unloaded' type;<br>
score -40 for starting a turbo-type compressor 3;<br>
score -20 for starting a compressor 4 of the variable<br>
speed type.<br>
All these scores are negative, which indicates that<br>
starting a compressor always has an unfavourable influence<br>
on the output, and that starting the compressor 2 is more<br>
unfavourable than starting the compressor 3, and even more<br>
unfavourable than starting the compressor 4.<br>
An example of a positive score is a score which corresponds<br>
to a control order which moves for example the operational<br>
point of compressor 4 with a variable rotational speed from<br>
the less favourable working zone C-E in figure 3 to the<br>
more favourable working zone E-F.<br>
The above-mentioned evaluation table is either calculated<br>
on the basis of the known characteristics of the<br>
compressors 2-3-4 or it is determined in an experimental<br>
manner.<br>
This table is stored in the memory 2 7 of the control box<br>
28 .<br>
When the compressed air installation 1 is operating, as<br>
represented in figure 4, the pressure in the compressed air<br>
network 8, for example the pressure at the pressure sensor<br>
32, is set in relation to a target pressure PS situated<br>
within a pressure interval which is limited by a maximum<br>
pressure PMAX and a minimum pressure PMIN.<br>
These pressures PS, PMAX and PMIN are set in the control<br>
box 28, for example via the computer 31.<br>
The control box 2 5 provides for the adjustment of the<br>
pressure P within the above-mentioned limits by controlling<br>
the flow of one or several of the above-mentioned<br>
compressors 2-3-4, in particular in order to increase the<br>
overall flow supplied by the compressors 2-3-4 when the<br>
pressure P drops too much, and to reduce the overall<br>
supplied flow when the pressure P rises too much.<br>
Preferably, when the pressure P in the compressed air<br>
network 8 rises above the set target pressure PS, the<br>
control box 28 will give a control order to increase the<br>
flow, a certain length of time X before the set maximum<br>
pressure PMAX is reached, and when the pressure in the<br>
compressed air network 8 drops below the set target<br>
pressure PS,' the control box 2 8 will give a control order<br>
to reduce the flow, a certain length of time X before the<br>
set minimum pressure PMIN is reached.<br>
Thus, by continuously adjusting the flows of the<br>
compressors 2-3-4 is obtained a very precise adjustment of<br>
the pressure P in the compressed air network 8.<br>
In order to optimize the adjustment of the flows and the<br>
selection of the suitable compressor 2-3-4, an algorithm is<br>
provided in the control box 28, in particular in the<br>
arithmetic unit 30, which compares the scores of all the<br>
control orders of all the compressors 2-3-4, either<br>
periodically or continuously, which would result in an<br>
appropriate flow variation so as to bring the pressure P<br>
closer to the target value PS.<br>
Judging by this comparison, the algorithm decides what<br>
control order is to be actually carried out on the basis of<br>
the highest score, so that the most favourable solution is<br>
at all times selected.<br>
If, for example, a flow increase can be obtained by means<br>
of a flow adjustment, both of the compressor 3 and of the<br>
compressor 4, the compressor 3-4 having the highest score<br>
will be selected.<br>
Preferably, the algorithm, when selecting the most<br>
favourable control order, will also take into account the<br>
overall score of combined control orders of one or several<br>
compressors 2-3-4 which can direct the overall flow in the<br>
required direction, whereby this simple or combined control<br>
order is then carried out with the highest score.<br>
In this manner is for example also reckoned with a combined<br>
control order whereby the flow of a single compressor, for<br>
example a compressor 2, is increased, while the flow of<br>
another compressor, for example of compressor 3, is<br>
simultaneously reduced in order to obtain an overall effect<br>
which brings the pressure P closer to the target pressure<br>
PS.<br>
In order to select the most favourable control order, the<br>
above-mentioned scores of the control orders can be<br>
increased with a value which is equal to the difference<br>
between the supplied flow before the control order and the<br>
hypothetically supplied flow following the control order,<br>
as calculated by the algorithm, multiplied by a negative<br>
weighing factor.<br>
If the value of the above-mentioned weighing factor is for<br>
example -1, a control order which would increase the flow<br>
with 50 units will then obtain a score -50, whereas a<br>
control order which would increase the flow with 30 units<br>
will obtain a more favourable score -30, such that when<br>
selecting the appropriate control orders, also the scope of<br>
the effect of a certain control order will be taken into<br>
account.<br>
Preferably, when selecting the best control order, also<br>
what is called the flow deviation is taken into account,<br>
which is the difference between the supplied flow and the<br>
required flow after a hypothetic implementation of the<br>
control order concerned, which flow deviation can be<br>
calculated by the control box 28.<br>
It is clear that a small flow deviation is judged as being<br>
more favourable than a large flow deviation.<br>
In practice, it is found that a control order which results<br>
in a negative flow deviation is more favourable than a<br>
control order which implies a positive flow deviation.<br>
The algorithm will take these data into account by giving<br>
an additional score to the control order concerned which is<br>
equal to the flow deviation, multiplied by a negative<br>
weighing factor whose absolute value is larger in the case<br>
where the above-mentioned difference is positive than in<br>
the case where this difference is negative.<br>
According to a special characteristic of the invention, the<br>
control box 28 can be made to take into account, when<br>
selecting the control orders, that all the compressors must<br>
wear to the same extent.<br>
This is realised by adding a value to the scores of the<br>
control orders which is equal to the number of working<br>
hours of the compressor 2-3-4 concerned, multiplied by a<br>
negative weighing factor.<br>
Thus, a compressor with a large number of working hours<br>
will be penalized in relation to a compressor 2-3-4 with<br>
less working hours when selecting the algorithm.<br>
In the same manner, a certain priority can be accorded to<br>
the control box 28 for the selection of the compressors 2-<br>
3-4, whereby a higher additional priority value will be<br>
accorded to certain compressors having priority, which is<br>
all the bigger as the required priority is higher.<br>
Also a forced priority can be imposed when starting the<br>
compressors 2-3-4, by according a starting priority to<br>
every compressor which is added to the aforesaid scores of<br>
the control orders after multiplication with a negative<br>
weighing factor.<br>
Thus, a compressor with starting priority 1 having the<br>
biggest priority will score less negatively than a<br>
compressor having a smaller starting priority 3.<br>
It is clear that, in this manner, also other criteria and<br>
priorities than the ones described above can be imposed on<br>
the control box 28, and that it is also possible, for<br>
example, to build in a clock in the control box 28, such<br>
that when controlling the compressed air installation 1,<br>
also the working hours, weekends and the like are taken<br>
into account.<br>
Such criteria and priorities can also be combined by adding<br>
up the above-mentioned scores, such that the algorithm will<br>
for example reckon with the output criterion as well as the<br>
wear criterion, whereby the importance attached to one or<br>
other- criterion is determined by the weighing factor.<br>
In this manner, the use of the compressed air installation<br>
1 can be taken advantage of in a very simple and flexible<br>
manner, whereby the user can program the control box 2 8 as<br>
desired.<br>
The control box can be programmed via the computer 31 or by<br>
means of a distant computer via the internet or the like.<br>
Naturally, the control box 28 itself can also be equipped<br>
with a keyboard and a screen, such that the programming<br>
must not necessarily be done via a separate computer 31 in<br>
this case.<br>
Figure 5 represents a variant of a compressed air<br>
installation. 1 which differs in that, in this case, also<br>
the compressor 4 of the variable speed type is equipped<br>
with a controllable inlet valve 34 and a controllable<br>
exhaust valve 35 having a free exhaust 3 6 in the<br>
atmosphere, which inlet valve 34 and exhaust valve 3 5 are<br>
connected to the control element 26.<br>
Naturally, these additional control units 34-35 can be<br>
controlled by the control box 28, such that the pressure in<br>
the compressed air network 8 can be adjusted even more<br>
precisely by setting the flows of the compressors 2-3-4.<br>
Although, in the figures, the compressed air installation 1<br>
comprises three compressors 2-3-4 of different types, it is<br>
not excluded that only one or two types of compressors are<br>
applied in the compressed air installation comprising<br>
several compressors.<br>
Nor is it excluded that more than three compressors are<br>
applied in any combination whatsoever as far as used<br>
compressor types are concerned.<br>
Nor is it excluded to combine the above-mentioned<br>
compressor types with compressors of the type having a<br>
modulating inlet or outlet of the - partial-load type<br>
compressor, in any combination whatsoever.<br>
Nor must the compressors be necessarily equipped with all<br>
the above-described control units (11-12-15-19-20-22-26-34-<br>
35), and, naturally, they can also be equipped with<br>
additional control units which can be either or not<br>
operated, by the control box 28.<br>
Although the figures always represent single-stage<br>
compressors, it is also possible for multi-staqe<br>
compressors to be applied with several compressor elements<br>
connected to each other in series or in parallel.<br>
It is clear that the invention can also be applied to other<br>
compressor installations which are used to compress other<br>
gases than air.<br>
The invention is by no means limited to the above-described<br>
method, control box and compressed air installation<br>
described as an example; on the contrary, such a method,<br>
control box and compressed air installation can be made<br>
according to several variants while still remaining within<br>
the scope of the invention.<br>
We Claim;<br>
1. Method for adjusting a compressed air installation with several<br>
compressors, which compressed air installation (1) mainly consists of two<br>
or more electrically driven compressors (2-3-4) of what is called the<br>
'loaded/unloaded' compressor (2) type and/or of the turbo compressor (3)<br>
type and/or of the compressor (4) type with variable rotational speed,<br>
whereby these compressors (2-3-4) are each connected to a single<br>
compressed air network (8) with their outlets (5-6-7), and whereby each<br>
compressor (2-3-4) is provided with one or several control units (11-12-<br>
15-19-20-22-26-34-35), characterized in that the method makes use of a<br>
control box (28) onto which is connected a pressure sensor (3Z) of the<br>
above-mentioned compressed air network (8), which control box (28)<br>
makes it possible to adjust the pressure (P) in the above-mentioned<br>
compressed air network (8) around a target pressure (PS) to be set and<br>
within a pressure interval which is limited by a minimum pressure (PMIN)<br>
to be set and a maximum pressure (PMAX) to be set, whereby the above-<br>
mentioned adjustment takes place by controlling the flow (Q) of one or<br>
several of the abovementioned compressors (2-3-4), in particular in order<br>
to increase the overall flow supplied by the compressors (2-3-4) when the<br>
pressure drops too much, and in order to lower the overall supplied flow<br>
when the pressure drops too much, and in order to lower the overall<br>
supplied flow when the pressure becomes too high; in that an evaluation<br>
table is stored in the memory of the control box (28) beforehand for every<br>
compressor (2-3-4) or for every type of compressor of the compressed air<br>
installation (1), whereby for every working condition of the<br>
compressor (2-3-4) concerned, the influence of an aforesaid control order is<br>
assessed, and whereby for every control order of the compressor concerned, a<br>
score is given which is positive when the influence of said order is favourable to<br>
the output of the compressed air installation (1), and which is negative when the<br>
aforesaid influence is unfavourable and whose absolute value is all the greater as<br>
the favourable or unfavourable influence is bigger; and in that, while the<br>
compressed air installation (1) is operational, in order to select the most<br>
favourable control order of the scores, the scores of all positive control orders<br>
which can direct the overall flow in the required direction in order to bring the<br>
pressure (P) in the compressed air network (8) closer to the set target pressure<br>
(PS), can be mutually compared by an algorithm, either periodically or<br>
continuously, after which the control order concerned with the highest score can<br>
be implemented.<br>
2. Method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the control box (28) controls the overall<br>
flow of the compressed air installation (1) by giving at least one control order to<br>
the aforesaid control unit (11-12-15-19-20-22-26-34-35) of a compressor, which<br>
control orders may consist among others in starting and/or stopping one or<br>
several compressors (2-3-4); in opening or closing a controlled inlet valve (11-<br>
19) of one or several compressors; in opening or closing an exhaust valve (12-<br>
20) of one or several compressors (2-3-4) to a more or lesser degree; and in<br>
adjusting the rotational speed of one or several compressors (3-4-5).<br>
3. Method as claimed in claim 1 or 2, comprising, when the pressure (P) in the<br>
compressed air network (8) rises above the set target pressure (PS), the control<br>
box (28) will increase the overall flow, a certain length of time before the set<br>
maximum pressure (PMAX) is reached, and when the pressure (P) in the<br>
compressed air network (8) drops below the set target pressure (PS), the control<br>
box (28) will reduce the overall flow, a certain length of time before the set<br>
minimum pressure (PMIN) is reached.<br>
4. Method as claimed in any of the preceding claims, wherein an evaluation table<br>
is stored in the memory of the control box (28) beforehand for every compressor<br>
(2-3-4) or for evey type of compressor of the compressed air installation (1),<br>
whereby for every working condition of the compressor (2-3-4) concerned, the<br>
influence of an aforesaid control order is assessed, and whereby for every<br>
control order of the compressor concerned, a score is given which is positive<br>
when the influence of said order is favourable to the output of the compressed<br>
air installation (1), and which is negative when the aforesaid influence is<br>
unfavourable and whose absolute value is all the greater as the favourable or<br>
unfavourable influence is bigger.<br>
5. Method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the algorithm, when selecting the most<br>
favourable control order, will also take into account the overall score of<br>
combined control orders of one or several compressors (2-3-4) which can direct<br>
the overall flow in the required direction, whereby this control order or combined<br>
control order is subsequently carried out with the highest score.<br>
6. Method as claimed in claim 5, wherein, in order to select the most favourable<br>
control order, the above-mentioned scores of the control orders are increased<br>
with a value which is equal to the difference between the supplied flow and the<br>
required flow after a hypothetic implementation of the control order concerned,<br>
multiplied by a negative weighing factor whose absolute value is bigger in the<br>
case where the above-mentioned difference is positive than in the case where<br>
this difference is negative.<br>
