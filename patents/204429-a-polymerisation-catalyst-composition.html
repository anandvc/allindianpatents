COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
                 A POLYMERISATION CATALYST COMPOSITION<br>
BP CHEMICALS LIMITED,  a British company,  of Britannic House,   1 Finsbury Circus, London EC2M 7BA, United Kingdom,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
POLYMERISATION CATALYST<br>
The present invention relates to transition metal based polymerisation catalysts and to their use in the polymensation and copolymerisation of olefins<br>
The use of certain transition metal compounds to polymerise 1-olefins, for example, ethylene, is well established in the prior art The use of Ziegler-Natta catalysts, 5 for example, those catalysts produced by activating titanium halides with organometallic compounds such as triethylaluminium, is fundamental to many commercial processes for manufacturing polyolefins.  Over the last twenty or thirty years, advances in the technology have led to the development of Ziegler-Natta catalysts which have such high activities that olefin polymers and copolymers containing very low concentrations of<br>
10      residua] catalyst can be produced directly in commercial polymerisation processes   The quantities of residual catalyst remaining in the produced polymer are so small as to render unnecessary their separation and removal for most commercial applications. Such processes can be operated by polymerising the monomers in the gas phase, or in solution or in suspension in a liquid hydrocarbon diluent. Polymerisation of the<br>
15      monomers can be earned out in the gas phase (the "gas phase process"), for example by fluidising under polymensation conditions a bed comprising the target polyolefin powder and particles of the desired catalyst using a fluidising gas stream comprising the gaseous monomer. In the so-called "solution process" the (co)polymerisation is conducted by introducing the monomer into a solution or suspension of the catalyst in a liquid<br>
20      hydrocarbon diluent under conditions of temperature and pressure such that the produced polyolefin forms as a solution in the hydrocarbon diluent   In the "slurry process" the temperature, pressure and choice of diluent are such thai the produced polymer forms as a suspension in the liquid hydrocarbon diluent    These processes arc<br><br><br>
generally operated at relatively low pressures (for example 10-50 bar) and low temperature (for example 50 to 150°C)<br>
Commodity polyethylenes are commercially produced in a variety of different types and grades. Homopolymerisation of ethylene with transition metal based catalysts 5      leads to the production of so-called "high density" grades of polyethylene.  These<br>
polymers have relatively high stiffness and are useful for making articles where inherent rigidity is required. Copolymerisation of ethylene with higher 1-olefins (eg butene, hexene or octene) is employed commercially to provide a wide variety of copolymers differing in density and in other important physical properties. Particularly important 10      copolymers made by copolymerising ethylene with higher 1-olefins using transition metal based catalysts are the copolymers having a density in the range of 0.9] to 0.93.  These copolymers which are generally referred to in 'he an as "linear low density polyethylene" are in many respects similar to the so called "low density" polyethylene produced by the high pressure free radical catalysed polymerisation of ethylene   Such polymers and 15      copolymers are used extensively in the manufacture of flexible blown film. In recent years the use of certain mctallocene catalysts (for example biscyclopentadienylzirconiumdichloride activated with alumoxane) has provided catalysts with potentially high activity. However, metallocene catalysts of this type suffer from a number of disadvantages, for example, high sensitivity to impurities when used with 20      commercially available monomers, diluents and process gas streams, the need to use large quantities of expensive alumoxanes to achieve high activity, and difficulties in putting the catalyst on to a suitable support<br>
Patent Application W098/27124 published on 25 June, 1998 discloses that ethylene may be polymerised by contacting it with certain iron or cobalt complexes of 25      selected 2,6-pyridinecarboxaldehydebis(imines) and 2,6-diacylpyridinebis(imines). An object of the present invention is to provide a novel catalyst suitable for polymerising monomers, for example, olefins, and especially for polymerising ethylene alone or for copolymerising ethylene with higher 1 -olefins   A further object of the invention is to provide an improved process for the polymerisation of olefins, especially 30      of ethylene alone or the copolymerisation of ethylene with higher 1 -olefins to provide homopolymers and copolymers having controllable molecular weights.  For example, using the catalysts of the present invention there can be made a wide variety of<br><br><br>
polyolefins such as, for example, liquid polyolefins, oligomers, resinous or tacky polyolefins, solid polyolefins suitable for making flexible film and solid polyolefins having high stiffness.<br>
The present invention provides a polymerisation catalyst comprising 5      (1) a nitrogen-containing iron compound having the following Formula Z,<br><br>
Formula Z<br>
10      and (2) an activating quantity of an activator compound selected from organoalununium compounds and hydrocarbylboron compounds<br>
wherein X represents an atom or group covalently or ionically bonded to the Fe and b is the valency of the atom or group X, characterised in that the catalyst is supported on (3) a solid particulate support material.<br>
15	Each of the nitrogen atoms in the compound of Formula Z is coordinated to the<br>
Fe atom by a "dative" bond, ie a bond formed by donation of a lone pair of electrons from the nitrogen atom.  The remaining bonds on each nitrogen atom are covalent bonds formed by electron sharing between the nitrogen atoms and the organic ligand.<br>
The atom or group represented by X in the compound of Formula Z is preferably 20      selected from halide, sulphate, nitrate, thiolate, thiocarboxyiate, BF/, PF6\ hydride, hydrocarbyloxide, carboxylate, hydrocarbyl, substituted hydrocarbyl and<br><br>
heterohydrocarbyl. Examples of such atoms or groups are chloride, bromide, iodide, methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, octyl, decyi, phenyl, benzyl, methoxide, ethoxide, isopropoxide, tosylate, triflate, formate, acetate, phenoxide and benzoate.<br>
Examples of the preferred atom or group X in the compounds of Formula Z are 5      halide, for example,  chloride, bromide; iodide, hydride; hydrocarbyloxide, for example, methoxide, ethoxide, isopropoxide, phenoxide; carboxylate, for example, formate, acetate, benzoate; hydrocarbyl, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, octyl, decyl, phenyl, benzyl; substituted hydrocarbyl; heterohydrocarbyl; tosylate; and triflate.  Most preferably X is selected from halide, hydride and hydrocarbyl.   Chloride is particularly 10      preferred.<br>
The Formula Z compound is preferably 2,6-diacetylpyridinebis(2,4,6 trimethyl anil)FeCl2.<br>
The activator compound for the catalyst of the present invention is suitably selected from organoaluminium compounds and hvdrocarbylboron compounds   Suitable 15      organoaluminium compounds include trialkyaluminium compounds, for example, trimethylaluminium, triethylaiuminium, tributylaluminium, tri-n-octylaluminium, ethylaluminium dichJoride, diethyialuminium chloride and alumoxanes.  Alumoxanes are well known in the art as typically the oligomeric compounds which can be prepared by the controlled addition of water to an alkylaluminium compound, for example 20      trimethylaluminium.  Such compounds can be 'linear, cyclic or mixtures thereof<br>
Commercially available alumoxanes are generally believed to be mixtures of linear and cyclic compounds. The cyclic alumoxanes can be represented by the formula [R1 AJO], and the linear alumoxanes by the formula R17(R1!AlO)s wherein s is a number from about 2 to 50, and wherein R16, R17, and R1S represent hydrocarbyl groups, preferably G 25      to C6 alkyl groups, for example methyl, ethyl or butyl groups. Examples of suitable hydrocarbylboron compounds are dimethylphenylammoniumtetra(phenyl)borate, trityltetra(phenyl)borate, triphenylboron. dimethylphenylammonium tetra(pentafluorophenyl)borate, sodium tetrakis[(bis-3,5-trifluoromethyI)phenyl]borate. H(OEt2)f(bis-3,5-30      trifluoromethyI)phenyl]borate, triryltetra(pentaf)uorophenyI)borate and tris(pentafluorophenyl) boron<br>
In the preparation of the catalysts of the present invention the quantity of<br><br><br>
activating compound selected from organoaluminium compounds and hydrocarbylboron compounds to be employed is easily determined by simple testing, for example, by the preparation of small test samples which can be used to polymerise small quantities of the monomer(s) and thus to determine the activity of the produced catalyst.  It is generally found that the quantity employed is sufficient to provide 0.1 to 20,000 atoms, preferably 1 to 2000 atoms of aluminium or boron per Fe atom in the compound of Formula Z.<br>
The solid particulate support material employed in the present invention can be, for example, any organic or inorganic solid which does not deleteriousiy affect the catalyst properties. The support can be, for example, an inorganic oxide, hydroxide or salt, for example, silica, alumina, silica-alumina, zirconia, magnesia (magnesium oxjde), magnesium chloride, pumice, talc, kieselguhr, calcium carbonate, calcium sulphate, or an organic polymer or prepolymer, for example polyethylene, polystyrene, or poly(aminostyrene).  Preferred supports are silica, alumina, zirconia, talc, kieselguhr, or magnesia. Particularly preferred are, for example, silica, alumina, or zirconia, or a polymer or prepolymer, for example polyethylene or polystyrene.<br>
The support material is preferably free from absorbed water or other materials which might deleteriousiy affect the performance of the catalyst of the present invention.<br>
The particle size of the support material is suitable in the range 5 to 500 microns, preferably in the range 20 to 200 microns.<br>
If desired the catalysts can be formed in situ in the presence of the support material, or the support material can be pre-impregnated or premixed, simultaneously or sequentially, with one or more of the catalyst components. If desired, the support material itself can be a heterogeneous catalyst, for example, a Ziegler Natta catalyst supported on a magnesium halide, a Phillips type (eg chromium oxide/silica) supported catalyst or a supported metallocene catalyst. Formation of the supported catalyst can be achieved for example by treating the compound of Formula Z with alumoxane in a suitable inert diluent, for example a volatile hydrocarbon, slurrying a particulate support material with the product and evaporating the volatile diluent.   The produced supported catalyst is preferably in the form of a free-flowing powder.<br>
The quantity of support material employed in the catalyst of the present invention can vary widely, for example from 100,000 to 1 grams per gram of Fe present in the Formula Z compound<br><br><br>
The surface area of the support material (BET) employed in the present invention<br>
is preferably in the range 5 to 1000 m2 per gram, most preferably 50 to 500 m2 per gram.<br>
The catalyst can be supported on the support material in any suitable manner, for<br>
example using conventional impregnation techniques.  For example, the catalyst<br>
5      components can be dissolved or suspended in a suitable diluent or solvent and slurried<br>
with the support material.  The support material thus impregnated with catalyst can then<br>
be separated from the solvent or diluent, for example, by filtration or evaporation<br>
techniques. Alternatively the supported catalyst can be stored in the presence of liquid<br>
diluent or solvent if desired.<br>
10	When it is desired to produce the supported catalyst in the form of an essentially<br>
dry powder, the latter suitably contains not more than 30 weight %, preferably not more than 10 weight %, most preferably not more than ! weight % of liquid diluent.<br>
A further aspect of the present invention provides a polymerisation catalyst system comprising (1) a compound having the Formula Z,  (2) an activating quantity of \5      an activator compound selected from organoalummium and hydrocarbylboron<br>
compounds, wherein the catalyst is supported on (3) a solid particulate support material, and further comprising (4) a neutral Lewis base<br>
In this further aspect of the present invention the preferences in relation to the activator compound, the nature of the support material and other characteristics of the 20      catalyst of the present invention are the same as expressed above. Neutral Lewis bases are well known in the art of Ziegler-Natta catalyst polymerisation technology. Examples of classes of neutral Lewis bases suitably employed in the present invention are unsaturated hydrocarbons, for example, alkenes (other than 1-olefins) or alkynes, primary, secondary and tertiary amines, amides, phosphoramides, phosphines, 25      phosphites, ethers, thioethers, nitriles, carbonvl compounds, for example, esters, ketones, aldehydes, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, sulphoxides, sulphones and boroxines. Although 1-olefins are capable of acting as neutral Lewis bases, for the purposes of the present invention they are regarded as monomer or comonomer 1-olefins and not as neutral Lewis bases per se. However, alkenes which are interna! olefins, for example, 2-30      butene and cyclohexene are regarded as neutral Lewis bases in the present invention Preferred Lewis bases are tertiary amines and aromatic esters, for example, dimethylaniline, diethylaniline, tributylamine, ethylhenzonte and benzylbenzoate   In this<br><br><br>
particular aspect of the present invention, components (1), (2), (3) and (4) of the catalyst system can be brought together simultaneously or in any desired order.  However, if components (2) and (4) are compounds which interact together strongly, for example, form a stable compound together, it is preferred to bring together the components (1) 5      and (2) in an initial step before adding component (4);  or to bring together componenis (1) and (4) in an initial step before introducing component (2). The support material (3) can be introduced at any stage in the procedure.  The quantities of components (1), (2) and (3) employed in the preparation of this catalyst system are suitably as described above. The quantity of the neutral Lewis Base [component (4)] is preferably such as to 10      provide a ratio of component (l)component (4) in the range 100:1 to 1:1000, most preferably in the range 1:1 to 1.20   Components (1), (2), (3) and (4) of the catalyst system can brought together, for example, as the neat materials, as a suspension or solution of the materials in a suitable diluent or solvent (for example a liquid hydrocarbon), or, if at least one of the components is volatile, by utilising the vapour o; 15      that component. The components can be brought together at any desired temperature Mixing the components together at room temperature is generally satisfactory   Heating to higher temperatures e.g. up to 120°C can be carried out if desired, e.g. to achieve better mixing of the components.  It is preferred to carry out the bringing together of components (1), (2), (3) and (4) in an inert atmosphere (e.g. dry nitrogen) or in vacuo.<br>
20	When it is desired to use a neutral Lewis base in the present invention, the<br>
supporting can be carried out, for example, by preforming the catalyst system comprising components (1), (2) and (4) and impregnating the support material preferably with a solution thereof, or by introducing to the support material one or more of the components simultaneously or sequentially.  If desired the support material (3) itself can<br>
25      have the properties of a neutral Lewis base and can be employed as, or in place of, the optional component (4)   An example of a support material having neutral Lewis base properties is poly(aminostyrcne) or a copolymer of styrene and aminostyrene (ie vinylaniline).<br>
The catalyst of the present invention can comprise, in addition to the compound<br>
30      of Formula 2, one or more other catalyst-forming transition metal compounds, for example one or more compounds having the general Formula B<br><br><br><br>

The catalysts of the present invention can also be employed in admixture with<br><br>
one or more other types of transition metal compounds or catalysts, for example,<br>
transition metal compounds of the type used in conventional Ziegler-Natta catalyst<br>
systems, metallocene-based catalysts, or heat activated supported chromium oxide<br>
catalysts (eg Phillips-type catalyst).<br>
5	The present invention further provides a process for the polymerisation and<br>
copolymerisation of 1-olefins comprising contacting the monomelic olefin under polymerisation conditions with the polymerisation catalyst of the present invention.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention provides a process for the polymerisation and copolymerisation of 1-olefins comprising contacting the monomeric 10      olefin under polymerisation conditions with the polymerisation catalyst of the present invention in the presence of hydrogen gas as a molecular weight modifier.<br>
The polymerisation conditions can be. for example, solution phase, slurry phase or gas phase. If desired, the catalyst can be used to polymerise ethylene under high pressure/high temperature process conditions wherein the polymeric material forms as a 15     melt in supercritical ethylene. Preferably the polymerisation is conducted under gas phase fluidised bed conditions<br>
Slurry phase polymerisation conditions or gas phase polymerisation conditions<br>
are particularly useful for the production of high density grades of polyethylene. In these<br>
processes the polymerisation conditions can be batch, continuous or semi-continuous.<br>
20	In the slurry phase polymerisation process the solid particles of supported<br>
catalyst are fed to a polymerisation zone either as dry powder or as a slurry in the polymerisation diluent. Preferably the panicles are fed to a polymerisation zone as a suspension in the polymerisation diluent   The polymerisation zone can be, for example, an autoclave or similar reaction vessel, or a continuous loop reactor, e.g. of the type 25      well-known in the manufacture of polyethylene by the Phillips Process. When the<br>
polymerisation process of the present invention is carried out under slurry conditions the polymerisation is preferably carried out at a temperature above 0°C, most preferably above 15°C. The polymerisation temperature is preferably maintained below the temperature at which the polymer commences to soften or sinter in the presence of the 30      polymerisation diluent   If the temperature is allowed to go above the latter temperature, fouling of the reactor can occur.  Adjustment of the polymensation within these defined temperature ranges can provide a useful means. of controlling the average molecular<br><br><br>
weight of the produced polymer<br>
In the process of the present invention employing hydrogen as molecular weight<br>
modifier, the quantity of hydrogen employed can vary widely.  Generally, the higher the<br>
concentration of hydrogen employed, the lower the average molecular weight of the<br>
5      produced polymer. The polymerisation process employing hydrogen gas can be applied<br>
to control or reduce the average molecular weight of polymers or copolymers prepared<br>
using for example, gas phase, slurry phase or solution phase polymerisation conditions<br>
The quantity of hydrogen gas to be employed to give the desired average molecular<br>
weight can be determined by simple "trial and error" polymerisation tests.<br>
10	The polymerisation process of the present invention provides polymers and<br>
copolymers, especially ethylene polymers, at remarkably high productivity (based on the amount of polymer or copolymer produced per unit weight of the Formula Z compound employed in the catalyst system)   This means that relatively very small quantities of the Formula Z compound are consumed in commercial processes using the process of the 15      present invention. It also means that when the polymerisation process of the present invention is operated under polymer recovery conditions that do not employ a catalyst separation step, thus leaving the supported catalyst, or residues thereof, in the polymer (e.g. as occurs in most commercial slurry and gas phase polymerisation processes), the amount of residual Formula Z compound in the produced polymer can be very small 20      Experiments carried out with the supported catalyst of the present invention show that. for example, polymerisation of ethylene under slurry polymerisation conditions can provide a particulate polyethylene product containing catalyst so diluted by the produced polyethylene that the concentration of Fe therein falls to, for example, I ppm. or less wherein "ppm" is defined as parts by weight of Fe per million parts by weight of 25      polymer. Thus polyethylene produced within a polymerisation reactor by the process of the present invention may contain catalyst diluted with the polyethylene to such an extent that the Fe content thereof is. for example, in the range of 1 - 0 0001 ppm, preferably 1 -0.001 ppm.<br>
Suitable monomers for use in the polymerisation process of the present invention 30      are, for example, ethylene, propylene, butene, hexene, methyl methacrylate, methyl<br>
acrylate, butyl acrylate, acryloniirile, vinyl acetate, and styrene.  Preferred monomers for homopolymerisation processes are ethylene and propylene   The catalyst is especially.<br><br><br>
useful for copolymerising ethylene with other 1-olefins such as propylene, 1-butene, 1-hexene, 4-methylpentene-l, and octene<br>
The catalyst of the present invention can also be used for copolymerising ethylene with other monomelic materials, for example , methyl methacrylate, methyl acrylate, 5      butyl acrylate, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and siyrene.<br>
The polymerisation conditions employed in the process of the present invention are preferably gas phase or slurry phase. Most preferably the polymerisation is conducted under gas phase fluidised bed conditions<br>
Methods for operating gas phase polymerisation processes are well known in the<br>
10      art.  Such methods generally involve agitating (eg by stirring, vibrating or fluidising) a<br>
bed of catalyst, or a bed of the target polymer (i.e. polymer having the same or similar<br>
physical properties to that which it is desired to make in the polymerisation process)<br>
containing a catalyst, and feeding thereto a stream of monomer at least partially in the<br>
gaseous phase, under conditions such that at least part of the monomer polymerises in<br>
15      contact with the catalyst in the bed   The bed is generaiiy cooled by the addition of cool<br>
gas (e.g. recycled gaseous monomer) and/or volatile liquid (e.g. a volatile inert<br>
hydrocarbon, or gaseous monomer which has been condensed to form a liquid)   The<br>
polymer produced in, and isolated from, gas phase processes forms directly a solid in the<br>
polymerisation zone and is free from, or substantially free from liquid. As is well known<br>
20      to those skilled in the art, if any liquid is allowed to enter the polymerisation zone of a<br>
gas phase polymerisation process the quantity of liquid is small in relation to the quantity<br>
of polymer present in the polymerisation zone. This is in contrast to "solution phase"<br>
processes wherein the polymer is formed dissolved in a solvent, and "slurry phase"<br>
processes wherein the polymer forms as a suspension in a liquid diluent.<br>
25	The gas phase process can be operated under batch, semi-batch, or so-called<br>
"continuous" conditions.  It is preferred to operate under conditions such that monomer is continuously recycled to an agitated polymerisation zone containing polymerisation catalyst, make-up monomer being provided to replace polymerised monomer, and continuously or intermittently withdrawing produced polymer from the polymerisation 30      zone at a rate comparable to the rate of formation of the polymer, fresh catalyst being added to the polymerisation zone to replace the catalyst withdrawn form the polymerisation zone with the produced polymer<br><br><br>
In the preferred embodiment of the gas phase polymerisation process of the present invention, the gas phase polymerisation conditions are preferably gas phase fluidised bed polymerisation conditions.<br>
Methods for operating gas phase fluidised bed processes for making polyethylene 5      and ethylene copolymers are well known in the art.  The process can be operated, for example, in a vertical cylindrical reactor equipped with a perforated distribution plate to support the bed and to distribute the incoming fluidising gas stream through the bed. The fluidising gas circulating through the bed serves to remove the heat of polymerisation from the bed and to supply monomer for polymerisation in the bed. Thus 10      the fluidising gas generally comprises the monomer(s) normally together with some inert gas (e.g. nitrogen) and optionally with hydrogen as molecular weight modifier. The hot fluidising gas emerging from the top of the bed is led optionally through a velocity reduction zone (this can be a cylindrical portion of the reactor having a wider diameter) and, if desired, a cyclone and or filters to disentrain fine solid particles from the gas 15      stream. The hot gas is then led to a heat exchanger to remove at least part of the heat of polymerisation. Catalyst is preferably fed continuously or at regular intervals to the bed. At start up of the process, the bed comprises fluidisable polymer which is preferably similar to the target polymer. Polymer is produced continuously within the bed by the polymerisation of the monomer(s). Preferably means are provided to discharge polymer 20     from the bed continuously or at regular intervals to maintain the fluidised bed at the<br>
desired height. The process is generally operated at relatively low pressure, for example, at 10 to 50 bars, and at temperatures for example, between 50 and 120 °C. The<br>
t<br>
temperature of the bed is maintained below the sintering temperature of the fluidised<br>
polymer to avoid problems of agglomeration.<br>
25	In the gas phase fluidised bed process for polymerisation of olefins the heat<br>
3<br>
evolved by the exothermic polymerisation reaction is normally removed from the polymerisation zone (i.e. the fluidised bed) by means of the fluidising gas stream as described above. The hot reactor gas emerging from the top of the bed is led through one or more heat exchangers wherein the gas is cooled   The cooled reactor gas, together with any make-up gas, is then recycled to the base of the bed. )n the gas phase fluidised bed polymerisation process of the present invention it is desirable to provide additional cooling of the bed (and ihereby improve the space time yield of the process)<br><br>
by feeding a volatile liquid to the bed under conditions such that the liquid evaporates in the bed thereby absorbing additional heat of polymerisation from the bed by the "latent heat of evaporation" effect.  When the hoi recycle gas from the bed enters the heat exchanger, the volatile liquid can condense out   In one embodiment of the present 5      invention the volatile liquid is separated from the recycle gas and reintroduced separately into the bed. Thus, for example, the volatile liquid can be separated and sprayed into the bed. In another embodiment of the present invention the volatile liquid is recycled to the bed with the recycle gas.  Thus the volatile liquid can be condensed from the fluidising gas stream emerging from the reactor and can be recycled to the bed with recycle gas, or 10      can be separated from the recycle gas and sprayed back into the bed.<br>
The method of condensing liquid in the recycle gas stream and returning the mixture of gas and entrained liquid to the bed is described in EP-A-0089691 and EP-A-0241947. It is preferred to reintroduce the condensed liquid into the bed separate from the recycle gas using the process described :n our US Patent 5541270, the teaching of !5      which is hereby incorporated into this specification.<br>
When using the catalysts of the present invention under gas phase polymensation conditions, the cataJyst, or one or more of the components employed to form the catalyst can, for example, be introduced into the polymerisation reaction zone in liquid form, for example, as a solution in an inert liquid diluent   Thus, for example, the transition metal 20      component, or the activator component, or both of these components can be dissolved or slurried in a liquid diluent and fed to the polymerisation zone. Under these circumstances it is preferred the liquid containing the component(s) is sprayed as fine droplets into the polymerisation zone. The droplet diameter is preferably within the range 1 to 1000 microns. EP-A-05930S3. the teaching of which is hereby incorporated 25      into this specification, discloses a process for introducing a polymerisation catalyst into a gas phase polymerisation   The methods disclosed in EP-A-0593083 can be suitably employed in the polymerisation process of the present invention if desired.<br>

Preparation of the supported catalyst<br>
2,6-Diacetylpyridinebts(2,6-diisopropylanil)FeCl2 was prepared as described in Comparative Example 1.<br>
Silica (103g ES70, supplied by Crosfield), which had been heated under flowing 5      nitrogen at 700°C, was placed in a Schlenk tube, and toluene (10ml) was added. The mixture was heated to 50°C.  To a solution of 2,6-diacetylpyridinebis(2,6-diisopropylaniI)FeCl2 (0.036g) in toluene (10ml) was added methylaluminoxane (5ml, 1.78M in toluene, supplied by Witco). This mixture was heated at 50°C and then transferred to the silica/toluene mixture. The silica/MAO/toIuene mixture was 10      maintained at 50°C, with regular stirring, for 1 hour before the toluene was removed, at 65°C, under vacuum to yield a free flowing powder. Example 27<br>

47 1 - Preparation of 2,6-diacetylpyridinebis(2,4,6 trimelhvl aniQ iron dichloride<br>
supported on MAO/silica<br>
All operations were conducted under nitrogen unless specified.  Silica (256 62g 30      of grade ES70X supplied by Crosficld), calcined at 200°C under flowing nitrogen, was placed in a 2L round bottomed flask.  Toluene (900ml) was added to the silica followed by methyl aluminoxane (441 mi, 1.5M in toluene supplied by Witco).  The MAO was<br><br><br>
allowed to react with the silica at room temperature for 10 minutes at which point the<br>
temperature was raised to 80°C and the slurry was mixed occasionally by manually<br>
shaking the flask. The temperature was maintained between 80 - 100°C for a period of 2<br>
hours.<br>
5	2,6-diacetylpyridinebis(2,4,6 irimethyl anil) iron dichloride prepared as in<br>
Example 9 above (3.48g) was slurried in toluene (50ml) and added to the MAO/silica slurry at 80°C.  A further aliquot of toluene (20ml) was used to ensure that all of the Fe complex was transferred to the MAO/silica   The Fe/MAO/silica was then heated at 80°C, with occasional shaking, for 1.5 hours and the solid allowed to settle. The clear<br>
10      supernatant solution was decanted from the ilask and the catalyst partially dried under vacuum at 80°C for 30 minutes and then left at room temperature for 16 hours. Drying of the catalyst was then continued, at 80°C under vacuum for a further 5 hours, until a dry free flowing powder resulted and no more solvent could be detected coming off the support.<br>
15      47.2 - Pilot scale polymerisations (slurry)<br>
A 93 litre Phillips continuous polymerisation loop reactor was used for the polymerisations. Ethylene, isobutane diluent, hydrogen and the catalyst prepared in Example 1.3 above were metered into the reactor to maintain the reaction conditions as detailed in the Table below. The reactor was operated at a polyethylene throughput of 70      approximately 7.5kg/hour. Polymer molecular weight was controlled by variation of hydrogen addition rate.<br>

Figures 1 and 2 of the Drawings show the kinetic profiles of ethylene 5      polymerisation under "slurry" conditions using unsupported catalysts compnsing 2,6-diacetylpyridinebis(2,6-diisopropylaniI)FeCl2 (Fig. J ) and 2,6-diacetylpyridinebis(2,4,6-trimethylaniI)FeCl2 (Fig. 2) both catalysts being activated with MAO.  It is clear from these kinetic profiles that both catalysts are highly active initially, but that activity falls off rapidly as polymerisation proceeds.<br>
10	Figures 3 and 4 of the Drawings show the kinetic profiles of ethylene<br>
polymerisation under "slurry" conditions using silica supported catalysts comprising 2,6-diacetylpyridinebis(2,6-diisopropylanil)FeCl2 (Fig.3 - Comparison) and 2,6-diacetylpyridinebis(2,4,6-irimethylanil)FeCl2 (Fig. 4 - Invention) both catalysts being activated with MAO    It can be seen that the activity of the catalyst of the present<br>
15      invention is relatively high at the commencement of the polymerisation, and only gradually diminishes as the polymerisation proceeds   On the other hand, in the Comparative Example (Fig. 3) the initial high activity rapidly reduced early in the course of the polymerisation<br><br><br>
Figures 5 and 6 of the Drawings show the kinetic profiles of ethylene polymerisation under "gas phase" conditions using silica supported catalysts comprising 2,6-diacetylpyridinebis(2,6-diisopropylanil)FeCl2 (Fig 5 - Comparison) and 2,6-diacetylpyridinebis(2,4&gt;6-trimelhylanil)FeCl2 (Fig 6 - Invention) both catalysts being activated with MAO.  In the Comparative Example the initial high activity falls away very rapidly to a comparatively low level of activity   In Figure 6, it can be seen that the catalyst of the present invention provides relatively high initial activity, and exhibits almost constant activity for the duration of the polymerisation test.<br><br>
