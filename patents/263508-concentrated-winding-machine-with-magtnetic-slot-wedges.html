CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application is related to U.S. Patent Application No.<br>
11/749,802 filed May 17, 2007, having attorney docket no. GP-308951-PTH-<br>
CD, entitled "Concentrated Winding Machine with Magnetic Slot Wedges,"<br>
which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002] This disclosure relates generally to electrical machines, and more<br>
particularly relates to concentrated winding machines.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] An electrical machine may have distributed windings or<br>
concentrated windings, the difference between these windings being well<br>
known to those of ordinary skill. In a concentrated winding machine, a stator<br>
may be constructed in segments, which are then connected to form the entire<br>
stator. This is illustrated in FIG. 1, which is a sectional diagram illustrating a<br>
conventional segmented stator 500 that is composed of a number of stator<br>
segments 510. Each stator segment includes an integral tooth 512 and teeth<br>
tips 515. The teeth 512 define stator slots 520 that lie between adjacent teeth.<br>
Each stator segment 510 is in contact with an adjacent stator segment 510 at<br>
one radial end, while at the other radial end the teeth tips 515 of the teeth 512<br>
are separated by a distance 505. The distance 505 may also be referred to as a<br>
slot opening.<br>
[0004] Conventional stator designs include fixed-tooth stators and loose-<br>
tooth stators. For purposes of this disclosure, a fixed-tooth stator is defined as<br>
a stator that does not allow for the movement of stator teeth with respect to<br>
one another. The segmented stator 500 may be referred to as a fixed-tooth<br><br>
from a stator tooth 720. Afterwards, a paper insulation slot liner may be<br>
placed around the teeth, and then coil is slid over the end of the stator teeth<br>
720 that do not have the teeth tips 715. Afterwards, the same end of the stator<br>
tooth 720 (the one without the teeth tips 715) is inserted in a corresponding<br>
slot on the stator back ring 710 to form the stator.<br>
[0008] However, a disadvantage to the method of stator construction<br>
illustrated in FIG. 3 is that it weakens the stator mechanical structure and<br>
lowers its stiffness. Therefore, compared to the segmented stator construction<br>
method illustrated by FIG. 1, this method is more susceptible to undesirable<br>
vibration and noise.<br>
[0009] Accordingly, it is desirable to have a fixed tooth stator that can take<br>
advantage of paper slot liners to increase slot fill. In addition, it is desirable to<br>
have a fixed tooth stator with increased stiffness. Furthermore, other desirable<br>
features and characteristics of the present invention will become apparent from<br>
the subsequent detailed description and the appended claims, taken in<br>
conjunction with the accompanying drawings and the foregoing technical field<br>
and background.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0010] An apparatus is provided for improving operational characteristics<br>
of a concentrated winding machine. The apparatus comprises a fixed-tooth<br>
stator that includes stator teeth arranged in an annular fashion about an axis to<br>
define stator slots between adjacent stator teeth, the stator slots having slot<br>
openings between the ends of the stator teeth. The apparatus includes<br>
conductive windings that form coils around the stator teeth and that occupy a<br>
portion of the slot openings, and magnetic wedges joined to the ends of the<br>
stator teeth to cover the slot openings.<br>
[0011] A method is provided for improving operational characteristics of a<br>
concentrated winding machine. The method comprises fabricating a fixed-<br>
tooth stator that has stator teeth, the stator teeth defining stator slots and slot<br>
openings between adjacent stator teeth, the fixed-tooth stator not allowing for<br><br>
stator because the stator 500 is assembled such that the individual stator<br>
segments 510 are joined in a way that does not allow stator teeth 512 to move<br>
relative to one another. Conversely, loose-tooth stators allow for the<br>
movement of stator teeth with respect to one another. Examples of loose-tooth<br>
stators may be found in United States Patent No. 6,844,653 to Kolomeitsev et<br>
al., issued January 18, 2005, entitled "Stator design for permanent magnet<br>
motor with combination slot wedge and tooth locator," which is incorporated<br>
by reference.<br>
[0005] Before the segmented stator 500 is assembled, the individual coils<br>
that are wrapped around each stator segment 510 are formed by winding<br>
around a bobbin, which is typically made of plastic. The plastic bobbin<br>
functions as a slot liner that isolates the winding from the stator lamination<br>
(iron). FIG. 2 is a sectional diagram illustrating a conventional stator segment<br>
620 having a coil 630 wrapped around a plastic bobbin 640.<br>
[0006] A disadvantage to using the plastic bobbin 640 as a slot liner is that<br>
it reduces the slot fill. That is, because the plastic is relatively thick, it<br>
decreases the volume in the stator slot that could otherwise be occupied by<br>
turns of the coil 630. Although paper insulation slot liners are thinner than<br>
plastic slot liners, paper insulation slot liners cannot be used in conventional<br>
segmented stator construction because bobbin style winding is not possible as<br>
the paper is often twisted or cut as the coil is wound around the paper. Also<br>
by filling the slot with more copper (thicker conductor), copper loss can be<br>
reduced. Reduced copper loss enables improved thermal performance of the<br>
machine.<br>
[0007] To solve this problem of segmented stator construction, stator teeth<br>
can be inserted in a continuous stator back ring. FIG. 3 is a sectional diagram<br>
illustrating another conventional fixed-tooth stator 700 that is constructed by<br>
inserting stator teeth 720 in a continuous stator back ring 710. Like the stator<br>
teeth 512 of FIG. 1, the stator teeth 720 define stator slots 725 between<br>
adjacent teeth, and the stator teeth have teeth tips 715 that define a small gap<br>
or slot opening 705. In this construction method the coil is wound separately<br><br>
relative movement between adjacent stator teeth. The method further<br>
comprises inserting magnetic wedges between adjacent stator teeth to close the<br>
slot openings.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF AN EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT<br>
[0026] The following detailed description is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and is not intended to limit the invention or the application and uses of the<br>
invention. Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any expressed or<br>
implied theory presented in the preceding technical field, background, brief<br>
summary, or the following detailed description.<br>
[0027] FIG. 4 is a sectional diagram illustrating the arrangement of the<br>
stator slots and rotor poles in a portion 800 of a concentrated winding machine<br>
in accordance with an example embodiment. The portion 800 illustrated in<br>
FIG. 4 has a periodicity of 8, that is, only l/8th of the complete geometry is<br>
shown in the diagram.<br>
[0028] In portion 800, fixed-tooth stator segments 810 each have a stator<br>
tooth 820, where stator slots 830 are defined between adjacent stator teeth 820.<br><br>
Also shown in portion 800 are a rotor 840, north rotor poles 850, and south<br>
rotor poles 860. In total, there are twenty-four stator slots 830 and sixteen<br>
rotor poles 850, 860, resulting in a slot-to-pole ratio of 1.5. For convenience,<br>
the geometry of FIG. 4 may be referred to as a 24-16 geometry. It should be<br>
emphasized that the 24-16 geometry is merely an example; alternative<br>
embodiments may have different numbers of slots and poles that result in a<br>
different slot-to-pole ratio.<br>
[0029] According to the example embodiment illustrated in FIG. 4, the<br>
stator segments 810 together form an annular stator yoke and the stator teeth<br>
820 extend from an edge of the annular stator yoke to define stator slots 830<br>
between adjacent stator teeth and slot openings at distal ends of the stator<br>
teeth. The concentrated winding machine further includes three phase<br>
windings A, B, C that form coils around the stator teeth 820 and that occupy a<br>
portion of the stator slots 830. As illustrated, each of the windings A, B, C has<br>
a positive coil-side and a negative coil-side, the negative coil-side indicated by<br>
the prime symbol (e.g., the negative coil-side of the phase A winding in<br>
indicated by A'). A relatively thin paper slot liner 880 is disposed around the<br>
slot, insulating the stator lamination (iron) from the windings A, B, C. FIG. 8<br>
illustrates a common configuration where the stator segments 810 surround a<br>
rotor 840 that rotates on a shaft (not shown). However, it should be kept in<br>
mind that the inventive aspects of the example embodiment may also be<br>
applied to so-called "inside-out" designs where the rotor rotates around the<br>
stator.<br>
[0030] FIG. 5 is a diagram that illustrates the winding distribution for the<br>
24-16 geometry of FIG. 4. In FIG. 5, six numbered slots are illustrated,<br>
representing one fourth of the complete 24-16 geometry. As can be seen in<br>
FIG. 4, there are two windings in each of the stator slots 830, where the phase<br>
of each winding is referred to with the letters A, B, C, and where the positive<br>
and negative coil-sides of each winding is indicated by the absence or<br>
presence of the "prime" symbol. That is, A', B', and C are all indicative of<br>
the negative coil-side. Thus, the stator 800 of FIG. 4 has double-layer<br><br>
concentrated windings. The bottom half of FIG. 5 illustrates the relationship<br>
of the rotor poles 850, 860 of FIG. 4 relative to the windings. For each of the<br>
phase windings A, B, C of FIG. 5, the relative magnitude and phase difference<br>
among the phase windings is as follows: Phase A: [0.866, -30], Phase B:<br>
[0.866, 90], Phase C: [0.866, 210]. The cogging frequency in the arrangement<br>
illustrated in FIG. 4 and FIG. 5 is 48 times the rotor mechanical frequency. Of<br>
course, other embodiments may exhibit different magnitudes, phases, and<br>
cogging frequencies.<br>
[0031] According to the example embodiment, the portion 800 further<br>
includes magnetic wedges 870 joined to the distal ends of adjacent stator teeth<br>
820 to close the slot openings of the stator slots 830. Compared to<br>
conventional fixed-tooth stator designs such as those illustrated in FIG. 1 and<br>
FIG. 3, the example embodiment lacks teeth tips 515 or 715. In the segmented<br>
stator 500 of FIG. 1, the presence of teeth tips 515 means that the individual<br>
stator segments 510 are separately bobbin-wrapped with a plastic bobbin to<br>
form the coils, as was described above. But according to the example<br>
embodiment, the stator segments 810 may be assembled to form the stator and<br>
thereafter the coils, which have been wound separately, may be slipped over<br>
the end of the stator teeth 820 along with a paper slot liner. The magnetic<br>
wedges 870 may then be joined to the stator teeth 820 after the coils and slot<br>
liners have been arranged on the stator teeth 820. Thus, according to the<br>
example embodiment, it is possible to achieve the stiffer mechanical<br>
construction offered by a fixed-tooth segmented stator, as well as increase the<br>
slot fill by using a thinner paper slot liner.<br>
[0032] According to the example embodiment, the presence of the<br>
magnetic wedges 870 also improves physical characteristics of the electrical<br>
machine. This is explained in further detail in the following paragraphs,<br>
which contain terms such as slotting effect, noise, vibration, cogging torque,<br>
torque ripple, leakage flux, eddy current, core loss, and spin loss. These terms<br>
refer to undesirable physical phenomena that may be present, in varying<br>
degrees, in electrical machines. Other terms such as reluctance, permeability,<br><br>
and rotor skew are also used. Since the meanings associated with these terms<br>
are well-known to those of skill in the art, a complete and thorough description<br>
of these terms is omitted for the sake of brevity, and cursory descriptions of<br>
these terms may instead appear.<br>
[0033] Generally speaking, there is a slotting effect that arises due to the<br>
presence of slots and slot openings in the stator, such as the slots 520 and slot<br>
openings 505 of FIG. 1, which have a lower magnetic permeability relative to<br>
the stator teeth material, which is typically iron. As explained above, the<br>
example embodiment illustrated in FIG. 4 does not have teeth tips, which<br>
allows the winding to be wound outside and then slid onto the teeth.<br>
However, the elimination of the teeth tips means the slot openings of the slots<br>
830 (FIG. 4) are wider than the slot openings 505 for the conventional stator<br>
of FIG. 1. Increasing the width of the slot opening generally results in an<br>
increased slotting effect.<br>
[0034] Two of the primary manifestations of the slotting effect are<br>
cogging torque and torque ripple. Cogging torque is produced from the<br>
physical structure of the machine, e.g., the magnetic attraction between the<br>
rotor-mounted magnets and the stator teeth. Cogging torque is an undesirable<br>
effect that contributes to torque ripple, vibration, and noise in the machine.<br>
The cogging torque can be physically felt if one attempts to manually turn the<br>
rotor of a small machine within a stator - in some positions the rotor will turn<br>
relatively easily, while in others there will be a noticeably increased resistance<br>
to the applied torque. On the other hand, torque ripple is produced from the<br>
harmonic content of the current and voltage waveforms in the machine.<br>
Torque ripple can be produced by the same slotting effect but at the presence<br>
of the winding current. The latter effect usually the major source of torque<br>
ripple in most machines.<br>
[0035] According to the example embodiment, the magnetic wedges 870<br>
are positioned across the slot opening to reduce the slotting effect. That is, the<br>
permeability of the selected wedge material is preferably high enough such<br><br>
that the reluctance of the magnetic field near the slot opening is reduced, thus<br>
lowering the slotting effect.<br>
[0036] FIG. 6 is a graph illustrating the cogging torque as a function of<br>
rotor position for a 24-16 concentrated winding machine having magnetic<br>
wedges in accordance with the example embodiment and for a conventional<br>
24-16 stator concentrated winding machine that has teeth tips, like the<br>
conventional design illustrated in FIG. 1. As shown in FIG. 10, the peak-to-<br>
peak cogging torque is reduced from 18 Newton meters (Nm) to 5 Nm after<br>
the introduction of the magnetic wedges.<br>
[0037] FIG. 7 is a graph illustrating the machine torque as a function of<br>
rotor position for a 24-16 concentrated winding machine having magnetic<br>
wedges in accordance with the example embodiment and for a conventional<br>
24-16 concentrated winding machine that has teeth tips and no magnetic<br>
wedges, like the conventional design with teeth tips 515 illustrated in FIG. 1.<br>
In the conventional design, the average torque is 232 Nm while the peak-to-<br>
peak torque ripple is 24 Nm, or about 10.3% of the average torque. The<br>
average torque of the geometry with the magnetic wedge is 223 Nm, a<br>
reduction of roughly 4% compared to the conventional design, while the peak-<br>
to-peak torque ripple is reduced to only 8.5 Nm, or about 3.8% of the average<br>
torque. Thus, while the average torque produced by the example embodiment<br>
is slightly less compared to the conventional design, there is a significant<br>
improvement in the torque ripple.<br>
[0038] FIG. 7 is also illustrative of an additional advantage of the<br>
magnetic wedges 870, which is related to noise. Noise performance is also an<br>
important design consideration for electrical motors. As was indicated above,<br>
the 24-16 geometry of FIG. 4 has a slot-to-pole ratio of 1.5. Generally<br>
speaking, this specific ratio of stator slots to rotor poles ensures a favorable<br>
radial force distribution. Since the radial force is a major source of noise, the<br>
ratio of 1.5 is also known as one that reduces machine noise, but it is<br>
unfortunately also a ratio that is associated with an increased torque ripple. A<br>
conventional method of reducing the unwanted torque ripple is to skew the<br><br>
rotor. However, rotor skewing increases the manufacturing cost and also<br>
reduces the machine torque by roughly 4% or greater. It should be noted that<br>
in FIG. 7, the significant improvement to the torque ripple achieved by the<br>
example embodiment is attainable without any skewing of the rotor, and the<br>
reduction in the average torque is less than what is typically achieved through<br>
conventional rotor skewing.<br>
[0039] Based on the results illustrated in FIGS. 6 and 7, it can be seen that<br>
the magnetic wedges 870 significantly reduce the repercussions of the slotting<br>
effect by reducing both the cogging torque and the torque ripple.<br>
Additionally, according to the example embodiment, the permeability of the<br>
magnetic material used in the magnetic wedges 870 is also preferably low<br>
enough to reduce the amount of leakage flux. That is, the permeability of the<br>
selected wedge material should also be lower than the permeability of the<br>
stator and rotor material in order to reduce the amount of leakage flux that<br>
would otherwise lower the machine torque.<br>
[0040] Thus, according to the example embodiment, the permeability of<br>
the magnetic wedges 870 is carefully selected such that it is high enough to<br>
reduce the slotting effect, but low enough to also reduce the amount of leakage<br>
flux. Powdered metal core type material such as Somoloy 500 manufactured<br>
by Hoganas AB of Hoganas, Sweden is one possible choice for the material of<br>
the magnetic wedge 870.<br>
[0041] Although it is desirable to use a magnetic wedge 870 having a<br>
permeability that is lower than the steel of the stator for the reasons explained<br>
above, alternative embodiments may use wedge material that has a<br>
comparable or even higher permeability than the stator material. In the latter<br>
case, the leakage may increase, thereby lowering the machine torque, but all<br>
other advantages would still be achieved.<br>
[0042] FIG. 8 is a sectional diagram that further illustrates a magnetic<br>
stator slot wedge 1200 and its relationship to the stator teeth 1210 and the<br>
rotor 1205 in accordance with an example embodiment. The magnetic stator<br>
slot wedge 1200 is shown in position across the slot opening of the stator slot<br><br>
of rotation will intersect both of the grooves. In the first case, the grooves<br>
1260, 1280 may be said to be partially radially offset, in the second case, the<br>
grooves 1260, 1280 can be said to be entirely radially offset.<br>
[0046] Radially offsetting the grooves 1260, 1280 in the manner described<br>
above is advantageous because it may be used to reduce the overall narrowing<br>
of the stator teeth 1210 in some or all radial positions, thereby preventing any<br>
significant reduction in magnetic flux in the stator teeth or torque. In<br>
alternative embodiments, the grooves 1260, 1280 may not be radially offset at<br>
all. Obviously, these embodiments could not reduce the narrowing of the<br>
stator teeth which is achieved through the embodiments that use radially offset<br>
grooves, but these embodiments would still be effective in preventing a<br>
reduction in torque.<br>
[0047] According to the example embodiment, an additional benefit of the<br>
magnetic wedges is that they significantly stiffen the stator, which in turn<br>
decreases noise and vibration. FIG. 9 is a graph that illustrates the natural<br>
frequency of a stator as a function of mode number, for a fixed-tooth stator<br>
fabricated with magnetic wedges in accordance with the example embodiment<br>
and for a corresponding conventional fixed-tooth segmented stator without<br>
magnetic wedges. As shown in FIG. 9, the inclusion of the stator wedge has<br>
increased the natural frequency of the stator significantly (top line) relative to<br>
the conventional stator (bottom line). As a result of the increased stiffness,<br>
machine noise and vibration is reduced.<br>
[0048] Another advantage of the example embodiment is that, because the<br>
windings in the stator slot are shielded from the magnetic field by the<br>
magnetic wedges 870, the eddy current induced in the windings is reduced<br>
compared to the conventional designs with no magnetic wedges. Another<br>
advantage is that due to the reduction of the slotting effect, the core losses in<br>
the stator are also reduced. This is illustrated in FIG. 10, which is a graph of<br>
the core loss (in Watts, W) as a function of rotor position for both a<br>
conventional fixed tooth stator design and a stator having magnetic wedges in<br>
accordance with the example embodiment. The induced eddy currents and<br><br>
1215, between two adjacent stator teeth 1210. The stator slot wedge 1200 is<br>
disposed at a distance 1220 from the surface of the rotor 1205. This distance<br>
is typically close to the airgap between the rotor and the stator. Two windings<br>
1230, 1240 are also shown occupying the stator slot 1215. Protrusions 1250,<br>
1270 on the edges of the stator slot wedge 1200 correspond to grooves 1260,<br>
1280, respectively on the edges of the stator teeth 1210. The grooves 1260,<br>
1280 are used to join the magnetic stator wedge 1200 to the stator teeth 1210.<br>
The grooves 1260, 1280 may be cut into the stator teeth 1210 or alternatively,<br>
formed at the same time as the stator teeth 1210 (e.g., punched lamination).<br>
[0043] FIG. 8 illustrates that according to the example embodiment, the<br>
protrusion 1250 and its corresponding groove 1260 are radially offset from the<br>
protrusion 1270 and its corresponding groove 1280. In other words, as seen in<br>
FIG. 8, the magnetic slot wedge 1200 has an asymmetric cross-section about<br>
the plane AB that contains the axis of rotation of the rotor and that is also<br>
equidistant from the ends of the magnetic slot wedge. Thus, the protrusion<br>
1250 that engages one of the adjacent stator teeth 1210 and the protrusion<br>
1270 that engages the other one of the adjacent stator teeth 1210 is not<br>
symmetric about the plane AB.<br>
[0044] As illustrated in FIG. 8, the magnetic slot wedge 1200 includes two<br>
protrusions 1250, 1270 that are structured to engage the ends of adjacent stator<br>
teeth 1210 at different radial positions relative to the axis of rotation of the<br>
rotor (not shown) that is contained by the plane AB. Each of the stator teeth<br>
1200 includes a groove 1260, 1280 disposed at the end of the stator tooth,<br>
where the grooves are structured to engage one of the two protrusions 1250,<br>
1270.<br>
[0045] According to the example embodiment of FIG. 8, the radial<br>
position of the groove 1280 relative to the axis of rotation overlaps the radial<br>
position of the groove 1260. That is, both the groove 1260 and the groove<br>
1280 are intersected by a single arc that is located at a fixed distance from the<br>
axis of rotation. In alternative embodiments, the radial position of the grooves<br>
1260, 1280 is such that no single arc located at a fixed distance from the axis<br><br>
core losses arising from the rotation of the machine may collectively be<br>
referred to as spin loss.<br>
[0049] FIG. 11 is a flowchart illustrating some processes included in a<br>
method 1500 of fabricating a concentrated winding machine according to an<br>
example embodiment. Method 1500 begins with process 1510, with the<br>
fabrication of stator segments. Each of the stator segments has at least one<br>
stator tooth, but contrary to conventional designs the stator tooth may not have<br>
teeth tips. Next, in process 1520, the stator windings for the concentrated<br>
winding machine are wound apart from the stator segments, using a bobbin<br>
winding method or other method known in the art. In alternative<br>
embodiments, process 1520 may occur before process 1510. In process 1530,<br>
the stator windings and a relatively thin paper slot liner are positioned over the<br>
stator teeth by sliding the windings and the paper slot liner over the end of the<br>
tooth. Alternatively, paper insulation may be wrapped around the stator teeth<br>
and the winding formed outside may be slid onto the stator teeth, over the<br>
paper slot liner. Last, in process 1540, magnetic wedges are inserted across<br>
the slot openings between adjacent stator teeth to close the slot openings and<br>
to achieve the advantages discussed in the above paragraphs.<br>
[0050] According to the example embodiment illustrated in FIG. 11,<br>
because the stator teeth do not have teeth tips, the stator windings may be<br>
wound apart from the stator teeth and then slid over the ends of the stator teeth<br>
along with a relatively thin paper slot liner. This advantageously increases the<br>
slot fill factor for the stator relative to the conventional method, such as<br>
illustrated in FIG. 2, where a relatively thick plastic slot liner 640 is used. An<br>
added advantage is that the thinner paper insulation may be used in<br>
conjunction with segmented stator construction, which is stronger than the<br>
method of inserting stator teeth into a continuous back ring, as was explained<br>
above with regard to FIG. 3. Accordingly, concentrated winding machines<br>
manufactured in accordance with example embodiments and achieving<br>
improved performance in accordance with example embodiments may be<br><br>
advantageously incorporated into a variety of electro-mechanical systems as<br>
will be apparent to those of skill in the art.<br>
[0051] FIG. 12 is a flowchart illustrating some processes included in a<br>
method 1600 for improving the characteristics of a fixed-tooth stator having<br>
stator teeth that define stator slots and slot openings according to an example<br>
embodiment. Method 1600 begins with process 1610, which is the formation<br>
of radially offset grooves in adjacent stator teeth. According to the example<br>
embodiment, the grooves are formed proximate to the distal ends of the<br>
adjacent stator teeth, but are radially offset from one another. That is, the<br>
grooves do not lie at the same distance from a geometric center of the fixed<br>
tooth stator. As was explained above, this offset decreases the overall<br>
reduction in the width of the stator teeth, which prevents undesirable<br>
reductions in flux and torque. In process 1620, the slot openings are closed by<br>
inserting magnetic wedges into the grooves, which achieves the advantages<br>
that were discussed above.<br>
[0052] FIG. 13 is a flowchart illustrating some processes included in a<br>
method 1700 according to an example embodiment. The method begins at<br>
process 1710, which is the fabrication of a fixed-tooth stator that does not<br>
allow for relative movement between adjacent stator teeth. The stator teeth<br>
define stator slots and slot openings between adjacent stator teeth. Next, in<br>
process 1720, magnetic wedges are inserted between adjacent stator teeth to<br>
achieve the advantages discussed above.<br>
[0053] In an example embodiment, process 1710 may include assembling<br>
the fixed tooth-stator from stator segments, where the stator segments each<br>
have at least one stator tooth that is integral to the stator segment. In an<br>
example embodiment, process 1710 may include fabricating the stator such<br>
that the stator teeth do not have teeth tips.<br>
[0054] In an example embodiment, process 1720 may include inserting<br>
magnetic wedges that have protrusions to engage a corresponding groove on<br>
each one of the adjacent stator teeth. The protrusions may be arranged to<br><br>
engage the corresponding groove at different relative positions on each one of<br>
the adjacent stator teeth.<br>
[0055] The invention may be practiced in many ways. What follows are<br>
descriptions of example, non-limiting embodiments.<br>
[0056] According to an example embodiment, a method includes<br>
fabricating stator segments having stator teeth that are integral to the stator<br>
segment, assembling the stator segments to form a stator that does not allow<br>
for relative movement between adjacent stator teeth, the stator teeth forming<br>

inserting magnetic slot wedges between adjacent stator teeth to close the stator<br>
slots.<br>
[0057] According to an example embodiment, fabricating the stator<br>
segments includes forming a first groove at a distal end of a first stator tooth<br>
and forming a second groove at a distal end of a second stator tooth. The first<br>
and second grooves may be arranged such that the first and second grooves are<br>
radially offset from one another after the stator segments are assembled.<br>
[0058] According to an example embodiment, inserting magnetic slot<br>
wedges includes inserting a first magnetic slot wedge having a first protrusion<br>

[0059] According to an example embodiment, a method further includes<br>
wrapping a conductive winding around an object to form coils in the<br>
conductive winding, and sliding each of the coils over a distal end of a<br>
corresponding one of the stator teeth to position each of the coils around the<br>
corresponding one of the stator teeth. According to an example embodiment,<br>
sliding each of the coils includes sliding each of the coils to achieve a<br>
concentrated winding configuration where a positive coil-side and a negative<br>
coil-side for the conductive winding are disposed adjacent to one another.<br>
According to an example embodiment, the method further includes positioning<br>
a paper slot liner over the distal end of the corresponding one of the stator<br><br>
teeth, the paper slot liner insulating each of the coils from the corresponding<br>
one of the stator teeth.<br>
[0060] According to an example embodiment, a method includes<br>
fabricating a magnetic slot wedge that is adapted to be joined to a first stator<br>
tooth and a second stator tooth. According to the embodiment, the first and<br>
second stator tooth may be part of a fixed-tooth stator that does not allow<br>
relative movement between the first stator tooth and the second stator tooth.<br>
[0061] According to an example embodiment, fabricating the magnetic<br>
slot wedge includes forming a first protrusion on the magnetic slot wedge, the<br>
first protrusion adapted to engage a first groove on the first stator tooth.<br>
Fabricating the magnetic slot wedge may further include forming a second<br>
protrusion on the magnetic slot wedge, the second protrusion adapted to<br>
engage a second groove on the second stator tooth. According to an example<br>
embodiment, the first protrusion and the second protrusion are arranged such<br>
that, when the first protrusion and second protrusion are engaging the first and<br>
second grooves, respectively, the first protrusion and the second protrusion are<br>
radially offset from one another relative to a geometric center of the fixed-<br>
tooth stator. According to an example embodiment, fabricating the magnetic<br>
slot wedge includes fabricating the magnetic slot wedge using a material<br>
having a permeability that is less than a permeability of a material used to<br>
fabricate the first stator tooth and the second stator tooth.<br>
[0062] According to an example embodiment, the method may further<br>
include forming the first groove in the first stator tooth, and forming the<br>
second groove in the second stator tooth. According to an example<br>
embodiment, forming the first and second grooves includes cutting the first<br>
and second grooves into the first and second stator teeth. According to an<br>
example embodiment, the magnetic slot wedge is adapted to close a stator slot<br>
between the first stator tooth and the second stator tooth in the fixed-tooth<br>
stator.<br>
[0063] According to an example embodiment, a method includes<br>
fabricating a fixed-tooth stator that has stator teeth with distal ends, the stator<br><br>
teeth defining stator slots and slot openings between adjacent stator teeth, the<br>
fixed-tooth stator not allowing for relative movement between adjacent stator<br>
teeth. The method further includes inserting magnetic wedges between<br>
adjacent stator teeth to close the slot openings.<br>
[0064] According to an example embodiment, fabricating the fixed-tooth<br>
stator includes assembling the fixed-tooth stator from stator segments, the<br>
stator segments each having at least one stator tooth, the at least one stator<br>
tooth integral to the stator segment. According to an example embodiment,<br>
fabricating the fixed-tooth stator further comprises fabricating the fixed-tooth<br>
stator such that the stator teeth do not have teeth tips. According to an<br>
example embodiment, fabricating the fixed-tooth stator further includes<br>
positioning coils around the stator teeth by sliding the coils over the distal<br>
ends of the stator teeth. According to an example embodiment, positioning<br>
coils around the stator teeth includes positioning the coils in a concentrated<br>
winding pattern such that a positive coil-side of a winding and a negative coil-<br>
side of the winding are arranged adjacent to each other.<br>
[0065] According to an example embodiment, fabricating the fixed-tooth<br>
stator further includes positioning paper slot liners around the stator teeth by<br>
sliding the paper slot liners over the distal ends of the stator teeth. According<br>
to an example embodiment, inserting magnetic wedges between adjacent<br>
stator teeth includes inserting magnetic wedges that have protrusions. Each<br>
protrusion may be arranged to engage a corresponding groove on each one of<br>
the adjacent stator teeth, and the protrusions may be arranged to engage the<br>
corresponding groove at different relative positions on each one of the<br>
adjacent stator teeth.<br>

the foregoing detailed description, it should be appreciated that a vast number<br>
of variations exist. It should also be appreciated that the exemplary<br>
embodiment or exemplary embodiments are only examples, and are not<br>
