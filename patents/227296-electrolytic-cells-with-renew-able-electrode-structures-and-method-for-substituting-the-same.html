				<td>ELECTROLYTIC CELLS WITH RENEWABLE ELECTRODE STRUCTURES<br>
AND METHOD FOR SUBSTITUTING THE SAME<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to electrolytic cells with renewable electrode<br>
structures and to a method for substituting the same.<br>
The use of planar electrodes formed by a substrate, in most of the cases<br>
foraminous, coated with one or more electrocatalytic materials is well known for<br>
electrochemical applications. The following description will mainly refer to<br>
electrode structures of this type, both anodic and cathodic, used in membrane<br>
electrolytic cells, as they represent a particularly significant case in the present<br>
scenario of industrial electrochemistry; however, it will be evident to the expert<br>
of the field that the same invention may be applied to other types of<br>
electrollysers and electrochemical cells in general, equipped with similar<br>
structural elements.<br>
An example of membrane electrolytic cell using planar electrodes with an<br>
electrocatalytic coating is illustrated in U.S. patent No. 4,767,519. The electrode<br>
structure described therein comprises a conductive core provided on both faces<br>
with a projecting support structure, protected against corrosion by means of<br>
cold-pressed sheets adapted thereto and provided with peripheral sealing<br>
flanges; said sheets, in the areas corresponding to the projections of said<br>
support structure, whose surfaces lie substantially on the same plane, are<br>
bonded to electrodic meshes provided with an electrocatalytic coating. The<br>
projecting support structure may be obtained by pressing the sheets forming the<br>
core or, according to a more conventional embodiment, by fixing<br><br>
electroconductive spacers bonded to the core itself, for example by welding. It is<br>
further known that the same type of construction may be provided on only one<br>
side of the metal core with projections supporting one single electrode having<br>
an electrocatalytic coating. This is for example the case of electrolysers<br>
provided, on the opposite side, with gas diffusion electrodes, as in the<br>
depolarised electrolysis of hydrochloric acid, for example according to the<br>
procedure described in British patent application no. GB 2,010.908. A<br>
particularly advantageous construction in the case of electrochemical processes<br>
of this type is described in German patent application no. DE 198 50 071: in this<br>
case the ribs are made of undulated sheets arranged in order to form channels<br>
for the alternate upward and downward circulation of the fluids. The structure<br>
described in DE 198 50 071 as a half-cell may obviously also be applied in the<br>
opposite side to form a complete double side structure, which may be used in<br>
electrolytic processes not comprising gas electrodes. Of course many<br>
alternatives of the above embodiments are possible, according to the different<br>
uses to which the corresponding electrochemical cells are directed; in all cases<br>
however, referring to a half-cell, that is a single, either anodic or cathodic<br>
electrolytic compartment, the common elements are a back-wall, a support<br>
structure, made of projecting elements, so that at least part of the terminal<br>
portion of each projection lies on the same plane, and an electrode, or<br>
arrangement of electrodes, fixed to said terminal surfaces lying on the same<br>
plane, for example by welding. The electrodes are usually provided with<br>
apertures or openings, usually consisting of holes; for example the electrodes<br>
may consist of meshes, perforated sheets, expanded sheets or a superposition<br>
or combination of two or more of said elements; alternatively however, the<br><br>
electrodes may be made of whole sheets, or parallel strips, for example<br>
arranged on a plane or inclined with respect to the common plane, non-<br>
overlapping or partially overlapping, as is the case of the so-called "louver" or<br>
"Venetian blind" configuration. The present invention is particularly useful in the<br>
case where said electrodes are at least partially provided with a catalytic<br>
coating, for example an electrocatalytic coating, as will be illustrated in the<br>
following description; however, it may be applied to any case where there is an<br>
occasional or periodical need for substituting at least part of said electrodes.<br>
In the prior art solutions cited before, the problem of substituting the electrodes<br>
is rather critical. For example, in the case of electrodes made of a conductive<br>
non-catalytic substrate provided with an electrocatalytic coating, said coating<br>
may be subject to deactivation with time, due to consumption, detachment from<br>
the substrate, passivation of the substrate itself in the area contacting the<br>
electrocatalytic coating, or for other reasons. For example, in the case of<br>
sodium chloride electrolysis, both the electrodes, cathode and anode, are<br>
preferably constituted by non-noble and non-catalytic conductive metals, coated<br>
with an electrocatalytic film containing noble metals. For example, in the case of<br>
the anode, the substrate may be made of a valve metal, for example titanium,<br>
and the coating is typically made of an electrocatalytic film for chlorine<br>
evolution, for example noble metals and oxides thereof. The lifetime of such<br>
coatings is usually in the range of a few years, after which it is necessary to<br>
replace the electrode or reactivate the substrate. Also in this last case, the<br>
detachment of the electrode from the cell structure is necessary; the<br>
reactivation procedure in fact foresees the steps of a radical cleaning of the<br>
substrate, spraying of the catalyst precursor and high temperature thermal<br><br>
treatment, which cannot be carried out in situ. In some cases, as it happens<br>
with nickel cathodes coated with nickel and ruthenium oxide, the reactivation<br>
may be carried out by means of a galvanic process; also in this case, as it is<br>
obvious, the detachment of the electrode from the cell structure is compulsory.<br>
The detachment procedure may be carried out in different ways; for example, in<br>
the case of electrodes in the form of a thin mesh, the latter may be torn off from<br>
the support structure whereto it was previously welded. This type of solution is<br>
however scarcely advisable as it involves the risk of seriously damaging the<br>
projections of the support structure upon removing a portion thereof or<br>
deforming their profile. Moreover, it is inevitable that part of the electrode<br>
substrate or of the welding material remains adhered to the projections when<br>
the electrode is torn off, resulting in a loss of planarity which causes some<br>
serious problems for the subsequent application of a substitute electrode<br>
structure, unless expensive and scarcely practical operations for cleaning and<br>
restoring the cell structure are carried out.<br>
A much more widespread technique, especially in the case of heavy structures,<br>
consists in cutting the electrode in correspondence of the areas adjacent to<br>
each projection of the support structure. In this way, portions of the deactivated<br>
electrode, typically in the form of strips, remain welded or otherwise fixed to the<br>
projections. The replacement electrode structure is subsequently applied to said<br>
residual portions of the electrode, rather than directly onto the ribs. In this way,<br>
it is evident that at each subsequent reactivation the distance between the<br>
active surface of the electrode and the back-wall is continuously increased by a<br>
thickness corresponding to the thickness of the electrode. As a logical<br>
consequence, at each subsequent reactivation it is necessary to provide for the<br><br>
substitution of the respective peripheral sealing gasket: it is in fact evident that<br>
in order to ensure the best performance, the cell design requires the external<br>
plane of the electrode to be at a well defined level with respect to the plane of<br>
the peripheral gaskets. The gasket replacement involves several<br>
disadvantages, in addition to the cost of the material per se; it is in fact<br>
necessary to have moulds of different thickness, each one bearing a<br>
remarkable cost. Furthermore, a higher thickness of the gaskets implies a<br>
greater creep under compression; this is particularly inopportune, for example,<br>
in the case of polymeric membrane electrolysers as an increased creep causes<br>
a higher stress on the membrane, interposed between said gaskets, and<br>
therefore a higher risk of rupture.<br>
A compendium of the various procedures applied according to the prior art for<br>
substituting mesh electrodes in membrane electrolysers provided with<br>
projections such as ribs is illustrated in US Patent US 5,454,925. According to<br>
an embodiment described therein and shown in the relevant figure 1, the<br>
deactivated mesh is cut in various ways, leaving a residual strip whereon a new<br>
activated mesh is welded. It is, in other words, a particular embodiment of the<br>
above described prior art, which is negatively affected by the increase in the<br>
distance between the cell back-wall and the electrode plane for each<br>
subsequent reactivation. It must be noted that, in the case of a membrane<br>
electrolyser, various reactivation cycles are to be effected during the cell<br>
lifetime, with the relevant variations in the distance between the back-wall and<br>
the electrode plane and consequently in the thickness of the respective<br>
peripheral gaskets. According to an alternative embodiment, the mesh is cut out<br>
completely, together with a portion of the projection whereto it is fixed;<br><br>
subsequently, as shown in a sequence in figures 2, 3 and 4 of the cited<br>
document, an angular element is applied, which is made of a pre-assembled<br>
metal strip with a mesh welded at a right angle, or a mesh or perforated sheet<br>
bent at a right angle. The replacement electrode is subsequently welded onto<br>
the angular element. It is quite evident that this type of embodiment neither<br>
solves the problem of the increase of the distance between the back-wall and<br>
the electrode plane, nor the one of the cutting of the mesh. It also exhibits<br>
further shortcomings: the angular element, according to what shown in the<br>
figures, is difficult to obtain with the desired tolerance on the 90° angle between<br>
the surface which must be abutting to the projection and the surface supporting<br>
the electrode; in the case of a pre-assembled element obtained by welding a<br>
mesh onto a metal strip, the welding procedure with the necessary tolerances is<br>
evidently very delicate. In the case of a mesh or bent sheet, the resulting<br>
element is not sufficiently rigid as to ensure that a perfectly orthogonal bending<br>
is maintained. Furthermore, an even more important aspect is the complexity of<br>
the welding to be made in order to bond the angular element to the residual<br>
portions of the projection, which must be substantially continuous along the<br>
whole surface of the latter in order to ensure a sufficient electrical conductivity.<br>
Even more disadvantageous and problematic appears the embodiment shown<br>
in figure 5 of the cited document, where the angular element is assembled in<br>
such a way that it does not use, as a guide, the pre-existing angle on the<br>
projection, which is completely removed when the deactivated electrode is<br>
detached. In this way the welding of the angular element to the projection is<br>
even more difficult, as in addition to the above mentioned problems, the<br>
problem of maintaining, with very strict tolerances, the parallelism between the<br><br>
main axes of the projections and the main axes of the angular elements must<br>
be taken into account. The removal of the constraint consisting in the residual<br>
portion of the projection on the electrode plane, in other words, implies that the<br>
parallelism between the cell back-wall and the electrode plane may deviate in<br>
two directions: along the main axes of the projections as above mentioned and<br>
in the perpendicular direction with respect to said axis, when the orthogonality<br>
of the two main planes of the angular element is not provided. In both cases,<br>
the most evident consequence of said deviation is the risk of compression of the<br>
membrane at one end, up to the possible perforation, and an excessive<br>
membrane-electrode gap at the other end.<br>
As a last remark, it must be noted that the procedures for substituting the<br>
electrodes illustrated in US 5,454,925 can be applied only when the projections<br>
of the support structure consist of mutually separated spacers, while no<br>
indication is given for cell designs wherein the projections are made of<br>
continuous profiles, obtained for example by direct moulding of the conductive<br>
core, or of channels formed by undulated sheets as described in DE 198 50<br>
071.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide an electrochemical cell design<br>
with renewable electrode structures overcoming the drawbacks of the prior art.<br>
In particular, it is an object of the present invention to provide an electrolytic cell,<br>
comprising at least one renewable electrode structure consisting of a back-wall<br>
provided with an arrangement of projections, at least part of the terminal<br>
surfaces thereof lying on a common plane, and by an electrode or arrangement<br>
of electrodes put, either directly of by means of intermediate elements, in<br>
contact with said terminal surfaces lying on the common plane, characterised in<br><br>
that said electrode or at least part of the electrodes of said arrangement of<br>
electrodes are removable and replaceable one or more times with substantially<br>
equivalent electrodes while maintaining the original distance from the back-wall.<br>
Under another aspect, it is an object of the present invention to provide a<br>
method for substituting the electrodes inside an electrolytic cell, comprising the<br>
complete removal of the exhausted electrodes and the application of new<br>
electrodes, characterised by a simple cutting of the structure with the removal of<br>
the exhausted electrodes and welding of new electrodes onto the original<br>
contact surface.<br>
According to a further aspect, it is an object of the present invention to provide a<br>
method for substituting the electrodes of an electrolytic cell, comprising the total<br>
removal of the exhausted electrodes and the installation of new electrodes,<br>
which may be applied to any design of cells provided with projections suitable<br>
for maintaining a fixed distance between the back-wall and the electrodes, said<br>
projections being made of mutually separated pieces, or by a suitably shaped<br>
continuous profile.<br>
According to a further aspect, it is an object of the present invention to provide a<br>
method for substituting the electrodes of an electrolytic cell without any need for<br>
substituting any peripheral gasket, or by substituting the peripheral gaskets<br>
without modifying their thickness.<br>
According to a particular embodiment, it is an object of the present invention to<br>
provide a method for substituting electrodes of an electrolytic cell without the<br>
need for cuttings or other damages to the removed electrodes.<br>
The invention consists in an electrolytic cell comprising at least one renewable<br>
electrode structure consisting in a back-wall provided with at least one<br><br>
arrangement of projections delimited on the side opposite to the back-wall by<br>
terminal surfaces lying on the same plane, and by one electrode or one<br>
arrangement of electrodes in contact with said terminal surfaces lying on the<br>
same plane, thus defining a multiplicity of contact surfaces, characterised in that<br>
part of each of said contact surfaces is free from constraints and the electrode<br>
or arrangement of electrodes is fixed to said terminal surfaces of the<br>
projections, for example by welding, only in the peripheral regions of said<br>
terminal surfaces.<br>
Under another aspect, the invention consists of a method for replacing the<br>
electrode or arrangement of electrodes with a substitute electrode or<br>
arrangement of electrodes in an electrolytic cell comprising at least one<br>
compartment consisting of a back-wall provided with at least one arrangement<br>
of projections delimited on the side opposite to the back-wall by terminal<br>
surfaces lying on the same plane, said electrodes to be replaced being in<br>
contact with said terminal surfaces lying on the same plane thus defining a<br>
contact surface, wherein at least part of each of said contact surfaces is free<br>
from constraints, and said electrodes to be replaced are fixed to said terminal<br>
surfaces of the projections, for example by welding, only in the peripheral<br>
regions of said terminal surfaces, characterised in that it comprises:<br>
•	cutting part of said terminal surfaces of the projections so as to remove the<br>
portions fixed to said electrodes to be replaced, avoiding at the same time<br>
to remove a substantial portion of the terminal surface free from constraints,<br>
and<br>
•	positioning said substitute electrodes onto the portion of terminal surface of<br>
the projection which was not removed during the previous cutting, fixing<br><br>
said substitute electrodes to said residual terminal surface, preferably in a<br>
peripheral portion of said residual terminal surface.<br>
These and other aspects of the invention are illustrated in the following<br>
examples, which however are not intended in any way to limit its extent which is<br>
defined only by the attached claims.<br>

according to the invention.<br>

embodiment; in particular, figure 5 shows the detachment of the exhausted<br>
electrode structure and figure 6 shows the positioning of the substitute electrode<br>
according to the invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
A first embodiment of the electrolytic cell of the invention is shown in figure 1; in<br>
the renewable electrode structure, delimited by the back-wall (1), a planar<br>
electrode (2) is fixed at a predetermined distance through at least one projection<br>
(3), consisting in a spacer fixed to the back-wall, which constitutes a repeating<br>
support element. The electrode is fixed to the spacer by means of a constraint<br><br>
(4), for example a welding, which crosses the contact surface between the<br>
electrode and the terminal surface of the spacer, that is the surface of the<br>
spacer opposed to the back-wall. As shown in the figures, said constraint is<br>
positioned in a peripheral region of said terminal surface; the remaining part of<br>
the terminal surface of the spacer in contact with the electrode is not fixed to<br>
the latter at all, just abutting thereto. Figure 1 shows also the peripheral flange<br>
(5) of the cell element, provided with a peripheral gasket (6). In the most<br>
common case, the flange and the back-wall are parts of a single structural<br>
element, shaped as a pan; in other embodiments, the flange and the back-wall<br>
may not be integrated in a single element and also other interposed elements<br>
may be present. The external surface of the electrode, that is the one not in<br>
contact with the spacer, is preferably at a defined and pre-determined level with<br>
respect to the external surface of the peripheral gasket. In a further preferred<br>
embodiment, the external surface of the electrode is at a defined level also with<br>
respect to the flange, in order to consequently define also the thickness of the<br>
gasket as per the previous description. According to the method of the invention<br>
for replacing the electrodes, when the electrode (2) must be replaced, for<br>
example because its catalytic coating is de-activated or for other reasons<br>
suggesting its substitution, the spacer (3) is cut along the line (7), thus<br>
permitting removal of the electrode. The cutting may be made from the outside,<br>
for example by means of a laser beam, by concurrently cutting the electrode in<br>
correspondence of the prolongation of line (7). The situation which takes place<br>
after removal of the electrode is shown in figure 2.<br>
Figure 3 shows the fixing of the substitute electrode (2') to the residue of the<br>
terminal surface of the spacer through a constraint (4'), for example a welding,<br><br>
preferably carried out in a peripheral region of the terminal surface of the<br>
spacer, leaving a considerable portion of the contact surface between the<br>
electrode and the spacer free of constraints; it is evident how, in this way,<br>
subsequent replacements are possible according to the above described<br>
method, by gradually removing small portions of the terminal surface of the<br>
spacer. Obviously the larger is the terminal surface of the spacer, the greater<br>
number of substitutions will be possible.<br>
Figures 1, 2 and 3 show a spacer with a particular shape, the profile of which<br>
may be likened to a Z; this shape is obviously only one of the shapes which<br>
permit to practice this particular embodiment of the invention, but also spacers<br>
whose profiles may be likened to a T, C, or reversed H or the like can be used<br>
as well.<br>
As in some cases the terminal surface of the spacer may be rather large, it is<br>
normally advantageous to provide the same with apertures or openings such as<br>
holes or channels, especially when the electrodes are also perforated, for<br>
example in the form of meshes, perforated sheets, expanded metal sheets. In<br>
this way, the large contact area between the spacer and the electrode avoids to<br>
negatively affect the fluodynamics of the electrolytic cell and, in the case of<br>
membrane cells, mainly avoids local blinding of the membrane, and thus the<br>
establishment of dangerous gradients of concentration and current, which are<br>
often the cause of the local failure of the membranes.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
A second embodiment of the electrolytic cell of the invention is shown in figure<br>
4; in the renewable electrode structure, delimited by the back-wall (1), a planar<br>
electrode (2) is fixed at a pre-determined distance through a projection (3)<br><br>
which constitutes the repeating support element. The projection (3) is made of<br>
two separate elements: the first, fixed to the back-wall, is made of a draw piece<br>
(8), for example an undulated sheet, which may form a channelling for the<br>
circulation of fluids according to the disclosure of DE 198 50 071. Alternatively,<br>
the draw piece (8) may be obtained with different geometries according to<br>
different procedures of the prior art, for example by cold-pressing of a sheet.<br>
The second element, fixed to the projecting part of the draw piece (8) for<br>
example by welding, is a planar element (9) which constitutes the contact<br>
surface of the projection. Said planar contact element (9) is preferably provided<br>
with apertures or openings, for example it is perforated or grooved, to avoid<br>
both blinding phenomena, in the case of membrane cells, and perturbations of<br>
the cell fluodynamics, according to the previous description.<br>
The electrode is fixed to each projection by means of a constraint (4), for<br>
example a welding, which crosses the contact surface between the electrode<br>
and the terminal surface of the projection, that is the contact surface between<br>
the electrode and the planar contact element (9). As shown in the figure, said<br>
constraint is positioned in a peripheral region of said terminal surface; the<br>
remaining part of the planar contact element (9) in contact with the electrode is<br>
by no means fixed to the latter but is simply abutting thereto. Figure 4 shows<br>
also the peripheral flange (5) of the cell element provided with a peripheral<br>
gasket (6). Also here, in most cases, the flange and the back-wall are integral<br>
parts of a unique structural element, which may be likened to a pan; in other<br>
embodiments, the flange and the back-wall may also not be integrated in a<br>
single element and interposed elements may also be present. The external<br>
surface of the electrode, that is the one not in contact with the projection, is<br><br>
preferably at a fixed and pre-determined level with respect to the external<br>
surface of the peripheral gasket. In a preferred embodiment, the external<br>
surface of the electrode is at a fixed level also with respect to the flange, in<br>
order to define, consequently, the thickness of the gasket as previously<br>
described. According to the method for replacing the electrodes of the invention,<br>
also in the case of this second embodiment, when the electrode (2) has to be<br>
replaced, for example because its catalytic coating is de-activated or for other<br>
reasons which impose or suggest its replacement, the projection (3) is cut along<br>
line (7), thus permitting the removal of the electrode. The cutting may be carried<br>
out from the outside, for example by means of a laser beam, by concurrently<br>
cutting the electrode in correspondence of the prolongation of line (7). The<br>
situation which occurs after removal of the electrode is shown in figure 5.<br>
Figure 6 shows the fixing of the substitute electrode (2') to the residue of the<br>
planar contact element (9) which coincides with the terminal surface of the<br>
projection, through a constraint (4'), for example a welding, preferably carried<br>
out in a peripheral region of the terminal surface of the spacer, leaving a<br>
substantial portion of the contact surface between the electrode and the spacer<br>
loose and free from constraints; it is evident how, in this way, subsequent<br>
substitutions are possible according to the above described method, by<br>
gradually removing small portions of the terminal surface of the spacer.<br>
Obviously the larger is the terminal surface of the spacer, the greater number of<br>
substitutions will be possible.<br><br>
