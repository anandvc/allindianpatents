				<td>CENTRAL UNIT FOR GROUPING ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS OF REFRIGERATORS, FREEZERS AND SIMILAR APPLIANCES<br>
The present invention relates to a central unit for grouping electronic and electrical components of refrigerators, freezers and similar appliances.<br>
In the aforelisted appliances, electrical and electronic components are variously connected together and to the mains by cables. By way of exeunple, a refrigerator can comprise at least one launp for lighting the preservation compartment or compartments, a set of electrical equipment such as fans, controls and the like, at least one compressor, probes for example for temperature, and an electronic circuit in the form of a card which on the basis of the data provided by the probes controls one or more of the aforesaid components.<br>
The multiplicity of connections and cabling results in chaotic disorder, which can be criticised not so much for its appearance but more for the time wasted in making these connections during the manufacture of the appliance (refrigerator) and in identifying a fault or malfunction during maintenance.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a central unit which enables connections and cabling to be simplified and hence favourably affect the cost of the operations concerned.<br>
This and further objects which will be more apparent from the ensuing detailed description are attained by a central unit in accordance with the teachings of the accompanying claims.<br><br>
The invention will be more apparent from the detailed description giver; hereinafter by way of non-limiting example with reference to the accompanying drawing, in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a perspective view with parts separated, showing the<br>
central unit of the invention;<br>
Figure 2 is again a perspective view with parts separated, showing<br>
the central unit of the invention, but taken from the opposite<br>
side;<br>
Figure 3 is a schematic partial section on the line III-III of<br>
Figure 1.<br>
With reference to Figure 1, the central unit of the invention is in the form of a box casing 1, constructed by moulding plastic material and consisting basically of two parts 1A, IB removably connected together by traditional means.  Inside the box casing 1 there is housed an electronic card 2, for example fixed by screw means to one of said parts, for example IB, on columns 3 forming one piece with said part.<br>
On the electronic card there are mounted metal contacts in accordance with the requirements for pin connectors (these contacts are partly visible in Figure 1 where they are indicated by 4), and the terminals for push-on connectors (a push-on connector is partly shown in Figure 3 where it is indicated by 5).<br>
The contacts 4 are accessible from the outside through at least one aperture 6 present in the box casing 1 and closable by a cover 7 (for example by snap-engagement).<br>
These contacts 4 are intended to be engaged, for example, by the cabled plugs 8 and g, one (8) for powering a lighting lamp, the other for powering electrical equipment (for example fans). The cover 7 enables the contacts 4 involving the cabled plugs 8 and 9 to be insulated from external agents. On the cover 7 there are provided passageways (not shown) for the sealed exit of the cables connected to the plugs 8 and 9. By means of a plug, not shown, a<br><br>
usual temperature probe can be connected via cable 10 to the contacts 4 to provide the control part of the card 2 with data for controlling the operation of the compressor or compressors powered by a cable 11 which penetrates into the box casing through an aperture, not shown. The cable 11 is connected to an electronic relay or static switch, mounted on the card or in the box casing, and controlled by the electronic circuit provided for this purpose.<br>
The part 1A of the casing 1 also presents a socket 12 to enable a conventional capacitor 13 to be mounted if required by the particular type of compressor motor. In the usual manner, the capacitor presents, for its electrical connection to the circuit which comprises it and which can be part of the board 2, the two traditional blades 14 for connection by the push-on connectors 5 through slots 15 forming part of the socket 12. As shown in Figure 3, said slots are closed by a film or thin layer 16<r provided during the moulding of box casing and which are broken capacitor is mounted on to enable electrical connection be made between blade push-on connector films cose slots not used prevent entry water or moisture into></r>
As can be seen from Figure 2, the part IB of the box casing 1 is provided with a socket 16 to enable electrical powering by the mains. To the side of the socket 16 there are provided two projecting hook-shaped appendices 17, 18 for coupling an angle plug 19 to the socket and maintaining it coupled. The angle plug 19 has two parts 19A and 19B, positioned at an angle to each other. The part 19A enters the angle plug 16 while the part 193 passes between the hook-shaped appendices &gt;WC J^Â«^o force these apart elastically and then be embedded within the space between them and be securely retained. The angle plug is connected to a cable 20 provided with a connection to the electric mains. The cable 20 is supplied with the appliance (refrigerator or the like) and can be connected by the user himself, and not necessarily<br><br>
during manufacture.<br>
During the testing of the appliance the straight plug 21 is used for the connection to the socket 16 because it does not act on the hook-shaped appendices 17, 18 and can hence be easily removed when testing is complete.<br>
The invention has the advantage of enabling the connections and cabling to be put into a state of order and the number of components (for example brackets, nuts, connectors etc.) involved in completing the electrical-electronic part of the appliance to be reduced. The invention also enables the capacitor to be immediately and easily mounted, the provision of the hook-shaped appendices 17, 18 (and in particular their positioning to the side of the socket 16) representing a way of simplifying or reducing a series of interventions and/or operations currently used during the manufacture of the household electrical appliance (refrigerator, freezer and the like). In this respect, the invention enables the electrical supply cables to use angle plugs, which can be installed by the user (as stated heretofore).<br>
These cables do not need to be expensively handled on or by the appliance production line, but instead can be dealt with separately; the hook-shaped appendices ensure that the angle plug will not become detached or withdrawn even in the case of impact or vibration; the use of a straight plug, hence not acting upon the hook-shaped appendices 17, 18, enables testing to be simplified and allows standardization of the connection system on all production lines; for the same product (appliance) and product appearance, storage standardization can be achieved for the packaged product if the cable 20 with its angle plug 19 is kept external to the product or inserted only on its despatch.<br><br><br>
WE   CLAIM :<br>
1.	A central unit for grouping electronic and electrical components of<br>
refrigersrtors, freezers and similar appliances, characterized by comprising an openable<br>
box casing (1) containing at least one electronic card (2) provided with electrical<br>
connection means (4) and socket means (16) for powering by the mains.<br>
2.	A central unit as claimed in claim 1, wherein the electrical connection means<br>
(4) are accessible through a possibly closeable aperture (6) in said box casing (1).<br>
3.	A central unit as claimed in claim 1 or claims 1 and 2 wherein the socket means<br>
(16) are flanked by hook-shaped appendices (17,18) such that these engage an angle<br>
plug (19) to retain it, whereas they allow free engagement/disengagement of a straight<br>
plug.<br>
4.	A central unit as claimed in at least one of the preceding claims, wherein the<br>
box casing (1) presents a socket (12) for engagement by a capacitor (13).<br>
