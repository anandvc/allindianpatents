				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention generally relates to a fibre property testing<br>
system. More particularly, the present invention relates to a cotton<br>
gin processing method and apparatus for optimizing the quality of cotton.<br>
The term "cotton" may be used in reference to either "seed cotton" or "lint." Seed<br>
cotton is the raw, natural flower of the cotton plant having the plant seed in intimate<br>
presence with the fiber of the flower. Lint is the flower fiber in isolation from the seed.<br>
Cotton ginning includes drying and trash removal from the seed cotton, separation<br>
of the plant seed from the lint, additional trash removal from the lint, lint consolidation and<br>
bale packaging. Depending on the mechanical capacities of the process equipment, a cotton<br>
gin may process as much as 150,000 pounds of seed cotton per hour into 12,000 pounds per<br>
hour of lint that is packaged into 500 pound bales. As implied, a cotton ginning system<br>
consists of several different types of processing machines or devices. Each machine is<br>
designed to influence one or more physical properties of the lint product.<br>
Lint quality after ginning is a function of its initial, natural quality as well as the<br>
type and degree of cleaning, drying or moisturizing it receives during the gin process. Fiber<br>
color, length, strength and density are natural attributes of quality. The presence of<br>
moisture and trash, however, are externally imposed quality characteristics susceptible to<br>
modification by mechanical influences. Research has established that the apparent strength<br>
of cotton fibers is directly proportional to fiber moisture content and is therefore greater at<br>
higher moisture levels. Consequently, as fiber moisture content is lowered, as by drying,<br>
the apparent strength is reduced and the frequency of fiber breakage during ginning is<br>
increased.<br>
Being a hygroscopic material, the"natural moisture content of cotton varies in<br>
relation to the relative humidity of the surrounding air. Cotton harvested during periods of<br>
high humidity may arrive at gins with a moisture content as high as 12 percent or more<br>
whereas cotton harvested during periods of low humidity may contain fiber moisture of 4<br>
percent or less. For these reasons, gins seeking to gin lint at a predetermined moisture<br><br>
content must be prepared to add as well as remove moisture from the cotton being<br>
processed. Nevertheless, most cotton in the United States is processed in a standardized<br>
sequence without regard to actual quantities of trash or moisture present in an immediate<br>
process batch. Consequently, some cotton may be over dried or processed through more<br>
cleaners than necessary for the level of trash originally present in the cotton. Such<br>
unnecessary or even harmful processing can result in decreased fiber quality and increased<br>
cost and/or processing time.<br>
Since much of the American cotton crop is harvested during low-humidity periods<br>
and often arrives at the gin with fiber moisture from 4 to 5 percent, the average fiber length<br>
of such cotton may be improved by adding moisture before fiber-seed separation and lint<br>
cleaning by reducing the number of fibers that break in the gin stands and lint cleaners.<br>
However, restoration of moisture to ginned lint will not improve fiber length. On the other<br>
hand, cotton with fiber moisture of 9 percent or more may neither gin smoothly nor process<br>
properly through the lint cleaners. Thus, the recommended fiber moisture level of 6.5 to 8<br>
percent has a gin production aspect as well as a product quality aspect.<br>
Removal of trash is primarily associated with the economics of market grade and<br>
price. However, there exists a point of diminishing returns where the benefits of further<br>
trash removal are offset by fiber and cottonseed damage and excessive loss of weight. Most<br>
modern gins contain cleaning equipment to handle the most severe trash condition that is<br>
expected in their service areas. Actual use of that equipment preferably should be based<br>
upon the incoming trash content of the cotton, and cleaner cottons should not be processed<br>
through every cleaning machine in the gin just because it is available. Trash removal should<br>
be restricted to that which is necessary to produce the grade determined by the color of the<br>
cotton. Further cleaning reduces the weight without increasing the value of the bale.<br>
One way to optimize the cotton processing sequence is to control the temperature of<br>
equipment such as driers and to bypass certain machines, such as seed cotton cleaners and<br>
lint cleaners that may not be necessary for the particular cotton being processed.<br>
Traditionally, physical properties of the cotton such as trash content, moisture content,<br>
color, fiber length, length variation, fiber strength, fiber elongation and fiber thickness<br>
were not monitored as the gin process progressed. Consequently, no system or method<br>
existed to determine a process sequence that would optimize the lint product quality, grade<br>
or value. Since there was no method for determining the optimum quality sequence, there<br>
were no means or apparatuses for carrying out an optimum quality sequence.<br>
Changing the number of cleaners used in a conventional cotton ginning<br>
system requires downtime for the system as well as labor costs for manually changing the<br>
valve configurations. It has been estimated that at least five minutes are required to change<br>
the valves on a single gin stand lint cleaner device, for those gin systems that are equipped<br>
with flow sequence change valves. A gin typically has three or more sets of lint cleaners in<br>
series or parallel processing lines but not all are equipped with bypass valves.<br>
To bypass a machine such as a lint cleaner in a conventional ginning system, the<br>
flow of cotton is stopped through the gin stand that immediately precedes the lint cleaner. If<br>
equipped, the valves in the material flow conduits to the machine that is to be bypassed are<br>
then closed, usually manually. The bypassed machine is then stopped. To put the bypassed<br>
machine back online, the process must be reversed. In order to bypass a machine such as a<br>
seed cotton cleaner or drier, all of the preceding machines must be stopped which<br>
consequently stops the flow of cotton throughout the entire gin system for a period of<br>
several minutes while the seed cotton cleaner valves are manually changed.<br>
More recently, the United States Department Of Agriculture and others have<br>
sponsored the development of online sensors for measuring color, moisture and trash<br>
values. Such developments are partially represented by U.S. patent number 5,058,444 to<br>
W. S. Anthony et al, U.S. patent number 5,087,120 to W. S. Anthony, and U.S. patent<br>
number 5,639,955, also to W. S. Anthony. As relevant to the present invention, the<br>
entirety of these prior art patent disclosures are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Pending U.S. patent application serial number 08/691,069, also incorporated<br>
entirely herein by reference, describes a cotton gin system having online sensors for the<br>
physical properties of color and moisture. Additionally, application serial number<br>
08/691,069 teaches an online measurement of the relative trash content in the system flow<br>
stream. Data correspqnding to these measurements is transmitted to a central processing<br>
unit (CPU). The CPU is a central control computer having a computer program logic that<br>
receives and processes the online sensor data to generate a gin decisional matrix from<br>
which flow sequence decisions are made that optimize the economic value of the flow<br>
stream. With a specific flow sequence concluded, appropriate operating signals are issued<br>
to powered How controllers such as motor operated valves in the seed cotton or lint<br>
transport conduits.<br>
Although pending application serial numben 08/691,069 represents a significant<br>
stride toward online quality development, the variable data base contributed to the program<br>
logic still is only color, moisture and trash. Fiber length, fiber length variation, fiber<br>
strength, the elongation capacity of the fiber and the fiber perimeter and wall thickness<br>
related property of micronaire are not considered by the prior art program logic.<br>
There is, therefore, need for an automatic gin control system that considers fiber<br>
strength, fiber length, fiber length variations, elongation capacity of the fiber and<br>
micronaire cotton properties along with color, moisture and trash in development of an<br>
optimum quality processing sequence. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention<br>
to provide a gin control system having online sensors for measuring fiber strength, fiber<br>
length, length variation, elongation capacity and micronaire as well as color, moisture and<br>
trash.<br>
It is also an object of the present invention to provide a substantially unitized<br>
instrument assembly that may be positioned at many locations along the material flow path<br>
of a gin system.<br>
A further object of the present invention is an apparatus that extracts a physical<br>
sample from an active gin processing stream without substantially interrupting the cotton<br>
flow stream continuity therein for an automatic manipulation of that physical sample to<br>
determine the average length of the fiber in transit, the variations in the fiber length, the<br>
elongation value of the fiber and the breaking strength of the fiber sample.<br>
Also an object of the invention is to provide several new instruments for the<br>
measurement of micronaire.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a method and apparatus for making a<br>
micronaire determination that avoids the necessity for weighing the sample.<br>
A still further pbject of the invention is to provide a modified method and apparatus<br>
for determining the maturity of a cotton sample.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a method and apparatus for<br>
obtaining a micronaire property measure from a live How stream without manual invasion<br>
or substantial interruption of the flow stream.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide a substantially unitized<br>
instrument assembly as a stand-alone piece of equipment, which is adapted to testing cotton<br>
fibers that are already removed from a source, such as a cotton gin, and manually presented<br>
as samples to the stand-alone instrument.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a substantially unitized<br>
instrument assembly as a stand-alone piece of equipment, which is adapted to testing cotton<br>
fibers that are already removed from a source, such as a cotton gin, and which can acquire<br>
and prepare the sample to be tested without manual assistance.<br>
In a cotton gin having a plurality of treatment units and ducting for transporting a<br>
flow of air entrained cotton, flow control devices such as remotely controlled motor valves<br>
are positioned in the ducting for selectively including or excluding particular treatment<br>
units. The duct flow control status of each flow control device is ordered by a gin control<br>
computer that is programmed to select a gin process sequence based upon data from online<br>
cotton property measurements. The cotton property tests made are for fiber strength, fiber<br>
length, fiber length variation and length elongation as well as for moisture, color<br>
contamination, micronaire and maturity. As desired, the control program may be written<br>
to bias the lint product quality, the lint grade, the lint value or other such control objective.<br>
Pivotal to the integrity of the program sequence directed by the computer is the accuracy<br>
and consistency of cotton property data transmitted to the computer.<br>
The present invention provides for online cotton flow stream samples to be isolated<br>
within the material transport ducting by paddle type samplers that temporarily collect a<br>
sample quantity of the duct flow stream and press it against a transparent window wall in<br>
the conduit. Reflectance or spectrographic optical sensors on the external side of the<br>
transparent window w,all respond to light values reflected from the sample mass pressed<br>
against the internal side of the window wall. Such reflected light values are detected by the<br>
optical sensor and used to determine the color and trash content of the sample.<br>
Moisture content of the flow stream sample that is captured by the online paddle is<br>
measured by a sensor having an electrical resistance grid. This resistance grid may be<br>
imbedded in the duct wall in a preferred embodiment or, alternatively, imbedded in the<br>
paddle. As the paddle presses the accumulated sample against the wall, the sample mass is<br>
intimately pressed against the resistance grid to induce a low but measurable leakage<br>
current through the sample having a current value proportional to the moisture content of<br>
the sample.<br>
The same or an independent paddle sample accumulator may also be used to press<br>
an in-conduit flow stream sample against a screen or aperture grid in the duct wall. On the<br>
exterior side of the duct wall but isolated from external atmosphere, is a closed circuit belt<br>
conveyor that carries a plurality of combs. As the belt is driven around the closed circuit,<br>
the combs are passed against the exterior surface of the aperture grid to rake a sampling of<br>
fibers from packed patches of fiber protruding through the apertures of the grid under the<br>
compression pressure of the paddle. With the fiber samples attached as a beard to the comb<br>
tines, the samples are firmly secured by a pinch bar. As the conveyor belt advances, the<br>
comb and attached fibers arrives at a combing station where the sample of fibers secured by<br>
the belt comb are combed. A second movement increment advances the belt comb and<br>
fiber sample held thereby to a brushing station that completes the parallelization of the<br>
beard fibers and removes loose fibers and foreign entities. A third station in the belt circuit<br>
first scans the sample beard optically for a composite of the length profile thereby providing<br>
length distribution data (fibergram) from which mean length, short fiber length and length<br>
uniformity are derived.<br>
Next, the extended sample beard is gripped between vise jaws secured to a load cell<br>
and measured tensile force is applied between the gripping comb and the vise jaws until the<br>
beard breaks. This measured tensile force relates to the fiber tensile strength and fiber<br>
elongation.<br>
Following the length measure/breaking station, the beard residual remaining in the<br>
gripping comb is advanced to a doffing station where the pinch bar is removed from<br>
engagement with the comb tines to release the fiber particles into a vacuum-removal<br>
system. For each station in the conveyor belt circuit, a sampling comb is provided to<br>
thereby produce an incrementally continuous flow of electrically transmitted data<br>
proportional to the measured fiber length, fiber length variation, fiber tensile strength and<br>
fiber elongation.<br>
Micronaire is an empirical measure of cotton fineness distinctive to the textile<br>
industry based upon fiber perimeter and fiber wall thickness. The micronaire value is<br>
determined by measuring a flow of air passing through the sample. The total fiber surface<br>
determines the flow resistance. By the traditional micronaire procedure, a known air flow<br>
rate is forced through a predetermined axial length of a fiber packed cylinder having a<br>
predetermined volume. The pressure loss over that axial length is measured and the<br>
measured value normalized by the weight of fiber within the packed volume. Implicitly, the<br>
micronaire property test requires several discrete steps including: isolation of a test quantity<br>
of fiber; placing that test quantity in a cylindrical test cell; applying the test flow stream to<br>
the test cell and through the test quantity of fiber; measuring the pressure drop of air flow<br>
across the axial length; and, weighing the test quantity of fiber.<br>
In the present invention, an online micronaire is accomplished by a ducting shunt<br>
from the main material carrier duct. A fiber suspending flow stream is induced into the<br>
shunt to deposit fiber against the face of a porous or perforated piston that constitutes a test<br>
cell end wall. As the shunt flow stream continues, fiber accumulates against the porous<br>
piston face and along the cylinder bore in front of the piston face. A pair of axially spaced<br>
pressure tap zones along the cylinder bore are pressure differentially monitored as an<br>
indicator of the quantity of fiber accumulated within the cylinder bore. At a predetermined<br>
accumulation point, the shunt is closed to the main fiber transport duct and a second<br>
perforated piston enters the fiber accumulation volume to compress the accumulation<br>
between the opposite piston faces. The volume to which the accumulation is compressed is<br>
a known constant or known by measured determination. In the latter case, the face of the<br>
compression piston engages the accumulated fiber mass to a predetermined pressure or<br>
force value. The position of the piston face at that compression force due is then measured<br>
for a corresponding volume determination. So disposed, a known air flow rate is<br>
established through the accumulated fiber within the fixed volume between the opposing<br>
piston faces and the corresponding pressure differential measured. Following measure of<br>
the pressure differential across the known volume, the first porous piston is retracted to<br>
open an axial extension of the accumulation cylinder to a tangential exit conduit. An abrupt<br>
pressure pulse of air against the second piston end of the accumulated fiber sample<br>
mobilizes the sample from the test position into the exit conduit. Transport along the exit<br>
conduit deposits the test sample onto a scale platform by which the weight of the test<br>
sample is taken, for those methods which require a weight measurement to be taken.<br>
Signals proportional to the test pressure differential and the test sample weight (either<br>
measured or empirically determined) are transmitted to the CPU for micronaire<br>
determination.<br>

Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
Process Flow System<br>
Referring to Figs. 1A-1D of the drawings wherein like reference characters<br>
designate like or similar machines or elements throughout the several figures of the<br>
drawings, a typical cotton ginning system is represented. Generally, cotton is transported<br>
sequentially through and between each processing station in an air flow stream confined<br>
within air duct conduits. Air flow velocity within a telescope pickup system for fluidized<br>
transport of seed cotton may be 5,500 to 6,000 ft/min. Air flow velocity for fluidized<br>
transport of lint cotton is about 2,000 to 3,500 ft/min.<br>
Cotton may be delivered from the growing fields to the gin in loose bulk or in<br>
consolidated modules. Loose bulk deliveries are drawn by a vacuum draft into the supply<br>
transport ducting 20 through a telescoping pickup pipe 10. Rail car or highway van size<br>
consolidated modules 16, on the other hand, may be placed upon a feed conveyor 15 for<br>
controlled feed into a dispersing head 12 and against a battery of rotatively driven, spiked<br>
rollers 14. The spiked rollers shred the module along a leading face to free the individual<br>
seed cotton bolls which are drawn into a feed hopper 17 by the draft of a fan 18. A suction<br>
pickup pipe 11 passes the seed cotton flow into the supply transport duct 20.<br>
Next along the seed cotton process line may be a green boll and rock separator 22.<br>
Machine-stripped cotton frequently contains many green, immature bolls that cause ginning<br>
problems such as clogging of the gin saw teeth, failure of the seed roll to turn,<br>
accumulation of sticky material on the inner surface of the roll boxes and on the saws and<br>
moving surfaces of the gin stands and other machines. Many of the green bolls are broken<br>
open by the cleaning machines and their contents add moisture to the adjacent cotton. Also,<br>
moisture is transferred from other wet plant materials to dry cotton, causing ginning<br>
problems. Cotton and cotton seed, especially when immature, contain small amounts of<br>
substances that become sticky when wet and that can be responsible for the gumming of gin<br><br>
machinery. Additionally, spindle pickers and machine strippers will pick up rocks, clods,<br>
metal scrap, roots and other heavy objects in the field. These contaminants must be<br>
removed before the cotton reaches the gin"s processing machines to cause machine damage,<br>
flow obstructions or fires.<br>
One of several types of green boll and rock separators employ centrifugal force<br>
arising from an abrupt change in the duct flow direction. Open, mature bolls tend to follow<br>
the air flow path more closely than the heavier, dense materials. Such dense materials tend<br>
to continue along a straight line of travel tangentially from the abrupt, air flow directional<br>
change. This tangential path leads into a contaminant collection chamber and expulsion<br>
from the system.<br>
Seed cotton feed rate into the supply transport ducting 20 and through the green boll<br>
and rock separator is controlled by a surge bin 24. Sensors in the surge bin turn the suction<br>
off and on by opening and closing a valve in the supply transport duct 20.<br>
Past the surge bin vacuum dropper 26, the seed cotton flow enters a first dryer<br>
supply duct 28 which delivers the flow into a first drying tower 30, depicted in Fig. 1B.<br>
As the cotton flow enters the dryer, the flow is mixed with dry, heated air. First dryer<br>
discharge ducting 32 transports the fluidized seed cotton flow into a first six cylinder<br>
inclined flow cleaner 34 for removal of finely divided particles and for opening and<br>
preparing the seed cotton for the drying and extraction processes to follow. The cylinder<br>
cleaner 34 consists of a series of spiked cylinders, usually 4 to 7 in number, that agitate and<br>
convey the seed cotton across cleaning surfaces containing small openings or slots. The<br>
cleaning surfaces may be either concave screen or grid rod sections, or serrated discs.<br>
Foreign matter that is dislodged from the seed cotton by the action of the cylinders falls<br>
through the screen, grid rod or disc openings for collection and disposal through a trash<br>
duct 36. The processed flow stream is delivered to a vacuum dropper 38 and a transport<br>
duct section 39. Vacuum supply duct 37 maintains a pressure differential across the screen<br>
or grid boundary to bias the transfer of dislodged trash through the screen or grid into a<br>
trash collection bin.<br>
The next seed cotton cleaning apparatus in a typical gin system may be a stick and<br>
green leaf machine 40 which includes two saw cylinders 42 and a reclaimed saw cylinder<br>
44. Cleaned cotton continues through the vacuum dropper 45 into the second tower dryer<br><br>
supply duct 47. Trash and reject material separated by the stick and green leaf machine 40<br>
passes a vacuum dropper 49 into a trash discharge duct 50.<br>
Proper drying of damp cotton benefits the producer, ginner, and spinner in several<br>
ways. Dryers condition the seed cotton for smoother and more continuous operation of the<br>
gin plant by removing excess moisture and by fluffing the partly opened locks. For these<br>
reasons, sufficient drying capacity is provided to a well conceived gin facility to<br>
accommodate a "worst case" circumstance. However, excessive drying can cause quality<br>
problems. Over drying damage comes from two sources: getting the fibers too hot and<br>
excess fiber breakage. Processing cotton through mechanical cleaners, gin stands, and saw-<br>
type lint cleaners while it is too dry and brittle induces fiber breakage thereby reducing the<br>
average fiber length. If the second tower dryer 52 is used, the material flow stream emerges<br>
through the second dryer discharge duct 54 for delivery to a second cylinder inclined<br>
cleaner 56, depicted in Fig. 1C. As the spiked cylinders pass the seed cotton over and<br>
under the cylinder alignment, vacuum drawn from the screen draft duct 59 pulls air through<br>
the cotton flow and the screen or grid. Dry contaminants on the cotton, loosened by the<br>
spiked cylinder mauling, are drawn through the screen or grid onto the trash collection bin<br>
for discharge through the trash duct 58. Accept cotton is discharged at the top of the<br>
cylinder incline into a vacuum dropper 60 and into an intermediate transport duct 62 for<br>
delivery to a third inclined cylinder cleaning machine 64.<br>
This third cleaner, however, also includes a lint reclaiming saw cylinder 66 that<br>
discharges loose lint captured from the flow stream into a vacuum dropper 68. Lint passed<br>
through the vacuum dropper 68 may be routed alternatively into an air lint cleaner 80 or<br>
into a controlled-batt saw lint cleaner 82 in the post-gin stand flow stream. Main flow from<br>
the third inclined cylinder cleaner 64 is next routed into a screw conveyor/distributor 72 for<br>
distribution along a gin supply chute 74 into the gin stand feeder assembly 76. The primary<br>
function of the feeder assembly is to feed the seed cotton flow to the gin stand uniformly<br>
and at controllable rates.<br>
The gin stand 78 is the heart of the gin plant. This mechanism separates the cotton<br>
seed from the cotton lint. The capacity of the system and the quality and potential spinning<br>
performance of the lint produced depends on the operating condition of the gin. Gin stand<br>
operational quality may affect every commonly measured fiber property except fiber<br><br>
strength and micronaire. Usually positioned immediately after the gin stand is an air lint<br>
cleaner 80. Loose lint from the gin stand is blown through a duct within the chamber of the<br>
air lint cleaner. Air and cotton moving through the duct change direction abruptly as they<br>
pass across a narrow trash-ejection slot. Foreign matter that is heavier than the cotton fibers<br>
and not too tightly held by the fibers is ejected through the slot by inertial force.<br>
Fluidized lint flow from the gin stand 78 and the air lint cleaner 80 is formed by saw<br>
lint cleaners 82 into a bat on a condenser screen drum. The bat is then fed through one or<br>
more sets of compression rollers, passed between a very closely fitted feed roller and feed<br>
plate or bar, and fed onto a saw-cylinder. Each set of compression rollers rotates slightly<br>
faster than the preceding series and produces some thinning of the batt. The feed roller and<br>
plate grip the batt so that a combing action takes place as the saw teeth seize the fibers. The<br>
teeth of the saw cylinder convey the fibers to the discharge point. While on the saw<br>
cylinder, the fibers are cleaned by a combination of centrifugal force, scrubbing action<br>
between saw cylinder and grid bars, and gravity assisted by an air current. The fibers may<br>
be doffed from the saw teeth by a revolving brush, air blast, or air suction. Depending on<br>
the number and capacity of contributing gin stands, a plurality of saw lint cleaners 82 may<br>
be cooperatively connected in a parallel battery 84 or in a serial sequence.<br>
Bale packaging is the final step in processing cotton at the gin. The packaging<br>
system consists of a battery condenser 90, a lint slide 94, a lint feeder 96 and bale press<br>
machinery 98, depicted in Fig. 1D. Clean lint flow from the lint cleaner battery 84 is<br>
discharged into a condenser delivery duct 86. Condensers 90 have a slow-turning, screened<br>
or perforated metal-covered drum 92 on which the ginned lint forms a batt. The batt is<br>
discharged between doffing rollers to the lint slide 94. Conveying air supplied by a vane-<br>
axial or high volume centrifugal fan passes through the screen on the drum and is<br>
discharged out one end of the drum through an air duct 99. The lint slide is a sheet metal<br>
trough connecting the battery condenser 90 to the lint feeder 96 of the baling station 98.<br>
The lint slide is installed at an angle of 33° to 45° from the horizontal to ensure sliding<br>
movement of the lint batt without rolling.<br>
Material Transport System<br>
Referring to Fig. 2, the cardinal process machines described above with respect to<br>
Figs. 1A-1D are shown by block representation. Lines connecting the machine blocks<br>
represent cotton transport ducting. Arrowheads in the duct lines represent the predominant<br>
flow direction in the respective duct. Simplistically, each process machine is shown with a<br>
cotton flow line in and a flow line out. In reality, the flow system is much more complex<br>
with parallel and shunt flows energized by fan draft systems and checked by powered<br>
vacuum droppers. For the present purposes, however, it is sufficient to represent flow<br>
control into and from a respective process machine by a single, 4-way valve symbol 100. It<br>
should be understood that the actual flow control device or devices employed for each<br>
machine may be more than one apparatus, the flow routing may differ from that of a 4-way<br>
valve or flow controllers may be completely omitted between particular process machines.<br>
Understanding the foregoing caveat, the 4-way valves 100A-100K provide two flow control<br>
routes by which the primary material flow stream may be alternatively routed into the<br>
associated process machine or past the machine as desired or commanded by control signals<br>
from a central computer 200. If primary material flow is routed into the process machine,<br>
discharge flow from the process machine is shown to be routed back to the 4-way valve for<br>
controlled return to the primary flow stream. If a process machine is bypassed, the flow<br>
discharge ducting from the machine is either blocked or connected to the inlet flow duct for<br>
closed loop isolation.<br>
Each of the valves 100A-K is operated by a motor of a form appropriate to the<br>
specific machine application. Such motors may be energized by electricity, compressed air<br>
or hydraulics. Here, the term "motor" is used expansively to include both rotating and<br>
linear drive machinery. Hence, motor control includes all of those actions and devices<br>
essential to convert a particular command signal from the computer 200 into the desired<br>
duct flow control objective. Such technology is well known to those of ordipary skill in the<br>
art and will not be further described herein except with respect to some mechanisms shown<br>
by Figs. 5-8 that are particularly suitable for duct flow control. Accordingly, the Fig. 2<br>
lines 102A-K connecting the duct flow control devices 100A-K with the control computer<br>
200 represent the respective duct control signal transmission routes.<br><br>
Associated with the cotton transfer ducting between each processing machine are<br>
sensor data transmitters 120A-L connected by signal carrier conduits 122A-L. In practice,<br>
each of the data transmitters 120 of Fig. 2 may represent a multiplicity of data transmitters,<br>
each transmitter of the multiplicity serving a particular cotton property measured by a<br>
corresponding test instrument.<br>
Cotton Sample Extraction<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates, in transparent outline, a typical square cross-section duct 110 for<br>
fluidized transport of air entrained cotton represented by the directional flow arrow 112.<br>
Along one duct boundary wall 104 is a sample depression 114 having a floor plane 116<br>
between side walls 118. Set within the depression floor plane 116 is a transparent window<br>
124 and a matrix 126 of apertures through the floor plane 116. Hinged between oppositely<br>
facing side walls 118 for rotation with an axle 136 parallel with the floor plane is a flapper<br>
element 130. Referring to the sectional view of Fig. 4, it is seen that the depression floor<br>
plane 116 is substantially spaced from the upstream face 132 of the flapper element when<br>
the flapper is rotated out of the duct flow stream. Preferably, the downstream face 134 is<br>
substantially parallel with the plane of duct wall 104 when the flapper 130 is rotated out of<br>
the duct flow stream. Flapper rotation may be driven by any suitably controlled power<br>
means such as a linear strut motor not shown acting upon a crank arm 138.<br>
As described by U.S. Patents 5,087,120 and 5,639,955, the complete specifications<br>
of which are incorporated herein by reference, a sample quantity of cotton in the duct flow<br>
stream is quickly accumulated against the upstream face 132 of the flapper when raised<br>
transversely into the flow stream. Further rotation of the flapper presses the cotton sample<br>
accumulation into the depression 114 as a tightly compacted mass of cotton 128 against the<br>
window 124 and the aperture matrix 126. On the external side of the window 124 is an<br>
optical analysis instrument 150 for detecting cotton properties such as color and trash<br>
content. Suitable for this purpose are video camera based instruments made by Motion<br>
Control, Inc. and Zellweger Uster, Inc., such as is described in U.S. patent application<br>
08/962,973 filed October 28, 1997, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference. Light reflected from the cotton surface compacted against the interior window<br><br>
124 surface stimulates electrical signals from the video camera 150. These signals, or an<br>
adjusted form thereof, are transmitted to the computer 200 as raw input data having<br>
proportional relevance to the cotton color and trash content.<br>
Bonded to the floor 116 of the depression 114 is an electrically charged grid 140<br>
comprising at least two parallel conductor circuits. The conductor elements are uninsulated<br>
for intimate electrical contact with cotton accumulations against the upstream face 132 of<br>
the flapper 130 when the flapper is rotated to compress the accumulation against the grid<br>
140. Leakage current between the parallel circuits is conducted by the compacted cotton<br>
sample as a variable resistance. The resistance value of the cotton sample 128 is<br>
proportional to the cotton sample moisture content. At a known voltage potential between<br>
the parallel circuits, the sample moisture content is proportional to the corresponding circuit<br>
current flow. Values for the current flow are therefore transmitted to the computer 200 as<br>
sample moisture data.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the parallel conductor circuits for moisture content<br>
sensing may be bonded against the upstream face 132 of the flapper 130. The moisture<br>
sensor is more completely described in U.S. patent application 08/963,855 filed November<br>
4, 1997, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Cotton sample accumulations 128 against the upstream face 132 of the flapper 130<br>
that are compacted into the depression 114 by rotation of the flapper also are compacted<br>
against the aperture matrix 126. Resultantly, lenticular bulges 142 of fiber protrude from<br>
the external side of the aperture plate 126. With respect to Figs. 4 and 9, a closed course<br>
conveyor or such as an endless carrier belt 160 having a plurality of comb devices 162<br>
secured thereto is coursed around a plurality of sprockets 164. Each comb is constructed<br>
with a rotatable tine carrier as described by U.S. patent number 5,178,007. This carrier<br>
belt is secured to the ducting 110 or other rigid framing structure to align the comb 162<br>
traveling route into close proximity with the external face of the aperture plate and the<br>
matrix of cotton bulges 142. Movement of the combs 162 drives the extended tines through<br>
the protruding cotton bulges 142 to rake out a subsample of cotton fiber.<br>
This subsample is characterized as a "beard" due to the physical appearance as an<br>
elongated, thin, fiat, cluster of various fiber lengths. Preferably, carrier belt movement is<br>
intermittent with each increment of the belt traveling distance being coordinated to the<br><br>
minimum separation distances between several beard preparation and testing stations 166,<br>
168, 170, and 172. Placement spacing between successive belt combs 162 along the carrier<br>
belt preferably corresponds to the belt movement interval. The stationary or standing<br>
interval between carrier belt movements is determined by the greatest beard sample<br>
processing time among the plural sequence. Normally, the standing interval is determined<br>
by the time required for a full cycle of the length/strength test instrument 170. Movement<br>
of the carrier belt 160 is driven by a motor not shown coupled to one of the belt carrier<br>
sprockets 164. Operational control over the belt drive motor may be by the central<br>
computer 200 but not necessarily so. Operation of the belt 160 is essentially independent of<br>
the computer 200 operation except for transmission of fiber property data to the computer<br>
200.<br>
Sample gathering by the flapper 130 also is an intermittent operation that includes a<br>
sample purging phase. Following at least one video scan of a compacted cotton sample 128<br>
and the raking of at least one subsample beard, the flapper 130 is rotated away from the<br>
compacted sample 128 and into a downstream streamlining depression 144. Normal<br>
boundary layer turbulence and aspiration induced by the duct flow mainstream 112 purges<br>
the compacted sample 128 from the sample depression 114 and off the upstream face 132 of<br>
the flapper 130.<br>
Representative samples of the main duct flow stream 112 for the micronaire test are<br>
preferably extracted by a shunting duct 180 depicted in Fig. 3. There are many well known<br>
techniques for inducing a small flow stream departure from a larger flow stream and most<br>
will include a partial vacuum or lower absolute pressure zone in the shunt duct 180 near its<br>
junction 182 with the main duct 100. In the example of Fig. 3, erection of the flapper 130<br>
creates a localized static pressure increase in the main flow stream proximate of the<br>
junction 182. A small, induced exit draft along the shunting duct 180 away from the<br>
junction 182 will draw cotton particles out of the main flow stream into the shunting duct<br>
180. A steady draft squrce for the shunting duct 180 is conveniently controlled by a disc<br>
valve 184 in the shunting duct flow channel. The disc axle shaft may be rotated, for<br>
example, by a crank arm 186 and a linear motor not shown.<br>
One alternative sample extraction method and apparatus for the micronaire test or<br>
others is represented by Figure 21. A cotton sample accumulation 128 within the transport<br><br>
duct 110 is compressed by any suitable means such as a reversing tamper 146 that presses<br>
the cotton bed 128 against the rotating tines or teeth 149 of a carding cylinder 148. A<br>
slotted aperture 158 in the duct wall 104 provides a shallow penetration of the tooth 149<br>
perimeter into the accumulated cotton bed 128. Fiber snagged by the teeth 149 from the<br>
accumulation bed 128 is carried by the teeth 149 around the rotational arc of the carding<br>
cylinder 148 into a rotating nip 188 with a rotary brush 246. Here, the more rapidly<br>
rotating rotary brush 246 extracts the samples from the card cylinder teeth. A vacuum pipe<br>
248 having a pickup opening adjacent to the brush 246 perimeter drafts the fiber held by the<br>
brush bristle into the pipe for delivery into the micronaire test chamber.<br>
In alternate embodiments, the cotton sample is not acquired and delivered<br>
automatically from the cotton feed stream in the gin to the test equipment. In these<br>
alternate embodiments, the cotton sample is obtained in some other manner and delivered to<br>
a stand-alone piece of test equipment. The stand-alone test station may house all or any one<br>
of a number of different combinations of the instrumentation described herein, including the<br>
testers for fiber length, fiber length distribution, fiber strength, fiber elongation, fiber<br>
moisture content, fiber trash content, fiber trash identification, fiber color, fiber color<br>
distribution, fiber micronaire, and fiber maturity. Preferably, the stand-alone test station<br>
includes test stations for fiber length, fiber moisture, and fiber color.<br>
In one embodiment, depicted in Fig. 26, large samples of cotton are acquired and<br>
brought to the test station 400 in bins or cassettes 402, such as depicted in Fig. 27. The<br>
bins or cassettes 402preferably include some sort of identifier so that each bin or cassette<br>
402 can be uniquely identified by the test station 400. One method of accomplishing this is<br>
to have a removable bar code label 404 on each bin or cassette 402, that is scanned by the<br>
test station 400 and to which all of the measurements taken by the test station 400 are<br>
correlated. The bins or cassettes 402 are loaded into an automated staging and indexing<br>
system, such as on a moving conveyor belt 406. In this manner, bins or cassettes 402<br>
containing new cotton; samples can be brought to the test station 400 and loaded while the<br>
test station 400 is still busy taking measurements on a previously loaded bin or cassette<br>
402. When the readings on the current bin or cassette 402 are concluded, the staging and<br>
indexing system is incremented, bringing the next bin or cassette 402 into a position when<br>
the cotton sample within it can be measured, while the previous cassette is placed onto an<br><br>
output means, such as another moving conveyor belt 408. The previously measured cotton<br>
sample is automatically moved to a holding station, from which it can be removed at a later<br>
point in time.<br>
In this embodiment, subsamples are preferably acquired from the cotton sample<br>
contained within the bin or cassette 402. In the process of acquiring the subsamples, the<br>
cotton sample is preferably more fully opened. In other words, the process of acquiring the<br>
subsample tends to individualize the fibers within the cotton sample to a greater degree.<br>
One such sample extraction apparatus is illustrated in Fig. 24 and comprises a pair of<br>
closed belt circuits 350 and 351 driven in opposite circulation directions. The segment 382<br>
of the belt 350 circuit cooperates with the segment 384 of the belt 351 circuit to delineate<br>
the boundaries of a fiber capture zone 380 therebetween. Traveling in opposite directions<br>
about respective circuits, these belt segments 382 and 384 converge upon a mutual throat<br>
zone 386.<br>
Belt 351 is driven about carrier rollers, including 352 and 353, having fixed position<br>
axes relative to the frame plates 354. The rotational axes of carrier rollers 355, 356 and<br>
357, however, are secured to a translation arm 358. The rotational axis of carrier roller<br>
355 is also restrained by a swing link 360 having an opposite end rotational axis common<br>
with that of a carding cylinder 362. The rotational axes of carrier rolls 355 and 350 are<br>
also confined to guide slot paths 366 and 368 secured to the frame plates 354. Translation<br>
movement of the translation arm 358 responds to the extension of rod 370 from the cylinder<br>
372. Such extension of the rod 370 translates the belt circuit 350 about the axis of carding<br>
cylinder 362 while the guide slots 366 and 368 sustain the orientation of the belt circuit 350<br>
relative to the belt circuit 351. Such translation selectively adjusts the sample capture zone<br>
380 volume between the belt circuits for consolidating cotton particles into the throat area<br>
386 therebetween. This throat area 386 discharges into the rotating convergence between<br>
carding cylinders 362 and 364. Emerging from the carding cylinder convergence, the fully<br>
opened cotton particles are drafted into a vacuum nozzle 374 for transport via discharge<br>
duct 376 to a micronaire measurement chamber or other cotton property test instrument,<br>
such a cotton maturity test station.<br>
In an alternate embodiment, the subsamples for the micronaire and maturity test<br>
stations are acquired by the carding and doffing apparatus as described more particularly<br>
elsewhere herein, and as depicted in Fig. 21.<br>
Preferably, the fiber subsamples for the fiber length, length distribution, strength,<br>
and elongation test stations 422 are acquired using a comb sampler on a circuitous belt,<br>
such as is described elsewhere herein with greater particularity. The combs contact the<br>
cotton within the cassette 402 in one or more of several different ways. For example, the<br>
combs can contact the cotton through a slot 410 in the top, bottom, or sides of the cassette<br>
402. Alternately, the combs can remove the cotton subsample from apertures 412 in the<br>
top, bottom, or sides of the cassette 402, where the cotton is pressed through the apertures<br>
412 by a ram 418 entering the cassette 402 from the other side.<br>
The subsamples for the fiber color, color distribution, trash content, and trash<br>
identification are preferably acquired by compressing the fiber sample within the cassette<br>
402 with a ram 418 that enters through a port 414on one side of the cassette 402, and<br>
presses the cotton subsample against a transparent plate of the cotton property test station<br>
420, which is disposed adjacent a second port 416 on the opposite side of the cassette 402.<br>
The fiber moisture sensing station is disposed adjacent the transparent plate in one<br>
embodiment, and in the end of the ram 418 in another.<br>
In yet another embodiment, depicted in Fig. 28A-28D, the stand-alone test<br>
equipment does not acquire subsamples from a bin or cassette 402. In this embodiment, the<br>
subsamples are prepared in another manner, such as by manually opening the cotton<br>
samples and placing them individually adjacent or within the testing surfaces or chambers<br>
where the measurements are taken. For example, the sample for the moisture content<br>
reading is placed into contact with the moisture sensor arrays 424, and the sample for the<br>
micronaire reading is placed within the micronaire chamber 426. Further, the sample for<br>
the length, strength, elongation, and fiber length distribution reading is placed on top of an<br>
aperture grid 428 whqre a comb can acquire the subsample. Thus, this is a more manual<br>
embodiment of the invention, which might be used in a gin having a lower volume of<br>
production, or in a gin where the raw cotton has very uniform properties over time so that<br>
the fully automated control of the other embodiments is not required.<br>
In a preferred configuration of this embodiment, a fiber containment means, such as<br>
a moving plate 430, compacts and confines a fiber sample in a stationary fashion between<br>
the plate 430 and a perimeter wall, such as a test surface 432. The fiber moisture testing<br>
station 424 may be located either in the moving plate 430 or on the test surface 432. The<br>
fiber color testing station 436 is preferably disposed adjacent a transparent optical window<br>
438 within a portion of the test surface 432.<br>
An aperture plate 428 is preferably disposed adjacent the optical window 438 in the<br>
test surface 432. The moving plate 430 presses a portion of the cotton sample through the<br>
apertures 440. This portion of the cotton sample is engaged by a comb on the other side of<br>
the aperture plate 428, and taken to a fiber testing station, such as a fiber length testing<br>
station. The comb may be a part of a circuitous sampler, described with more particularity<br>
elsewhere herein. Alternately, the comb may be a single comb that travels along a path to<br>
grooming stations and then to the testing station, and then returns along the same path to<br>
acquire another subsample. In the preferred embodiment, the comb is moved relative to the<br>
cotton sample, which is held stationary in reference to the rest of the testing apparatus.<br>
Thus, the subsampling comb moves relative to the rest of the testing apparatus. This<br>
greatly simplifies the mechanical operation of the subsampling process, and allows for the<br>
other tests, such as moisture content and trash content, to be concurrently performed on<br>
portions of the same fiber sample from which the fiber length subsample is taken.<br>
A console 442 is used to enter identifying and other information about the fiber<br>
sample being testing. The information may be entered on a keyboard 446 or by a bar code<br>
reader 444. The information and test results are presented on a display 448.<br>
Duct Flow Routing<br>
Viewing Figs. 5 and 6 together, a typical duct flow routing apparatus is shown to<br>
serve the saw lint oleaner 82I. The same duct flow routing principles described hereafter<br>
with respect to the lint cleaner 82I are also applicable to the other material processing and<br>
conditioning machines in the gin system such as the dryers and green boll separators.<br>
For the example selected, transitional ducts 106I and 108I connect the flow<br>
controller body 100I (4-way valve) to the main flow stream duct 110I. Between the<br><br>
junctions with the main duct 110I respective to the transitional ducts 1061 and 1081 is a duct<br>
flow gate 196I rotated about an operational quadrant by a linear motor 1971. Deployment of<br>
the flow gate 196I blocks the main flow stream between an upstream duct section 1101 and<br>
a downstream duct section 110J. When the flow gate 196I is deployed to block flow<br>
between duct sections 110I and llOJ, linear motor 199I operates to rotate the flow gate<br>
1981 to a position of open flow connection between the upstream duct section 110I and the<br>
inlet transitional duct 106I. Additionally, linear motor 194I operates to position the flow<br>
controller switch plate 190I for isolation of the inlet flow stream from the exit flow stream.<br>
Accordingly, the cotton entrained flow stream arriving along duct section 110I is guided<br>
into the transitional duct 106I and Finally into the lint condenser supply chute 81I. Coming<br>
out of the lint cleaner 82I, discharge duct 86I transports the flow stream back to the flow<br>
controller 100I and from there into the discharge transitional duct 108I for return into the<br>
downstream section 110J of the mainstream duct.<br>
In the alternative condition, the duct flow routing apparatus of Figs. 5 and 6 rotates<br>
the mainstream flow gate 196I to open the main flow stream duct between the upstream<br>
duct section 110I and the downstream duct section llOJ. Simultaneously, flow gate 198I is<br>
rotated to close the juncture opening between the upstream duct section 110I and the<br>
transitional inlet duct 106I. Although mainstream flow into the cleaner 82I is blocked by<br>
flow gate 198I, it is essential that the process machine be isolated from the main transport<br>
duct 110J for purposes of draft power management. Hence, the flow switch plate is rotated<br>
to the closure position that isolates the cleaner inlet and discharge ducts 81I and 86I from<br>
the flow controller outlet 108I and the main duct 110J.<br>
An alternate embodiment of the automated flow control for the present invention is<br>
schematically illustrated by Fig. 7. In this embodiment, closure of the flow gate 212 by<br>
rotary actuator 214 isolates an upstream section 110B of the main flow stream from a<br>
downstream section 110C. Coordinately, remotely controlled rotary actuator 218 positions<br>
the flow gate 216 to open a passageway from the mainstream duct 110B into the flow<br>
controller inlet 106B. Additionally, remotely controlled rotary actuator 211 positions the<br>
flow switch plate 210 of the 4-way valve 100B to isolate the flow stream into the inclined<br>
cylinder cleaner 34 from the discharge flow stream 39. Simultaneously, 4-way valve 100B<br>
connects the cylinder cleaner discharge duct with the valve discharge conduit 108B and the<br>
downstream section 110C of the main flow stream.<br>
Should it be determined by the material property test data that processing the<br>
material flow stream through the stick and green leaf cleaner 40 is unnecessary and<br>
undesirable, remotely controlled rotary actuator 226 operates the flow gate 224 to close the<br>
machine 40 inlet duct 106C from the main flow stream 110C. Flow gate 220 is operated by<br>
rotary actuator 222 to open the mainstream flow section 110C to the next successive flow<br>
section 110D.<br>
The Fig. 8 invention embodiment engages a Y-joint section 228 of ducting at the<br>
juncture of the flow controller inlet 106B with the mainstream duct 110. In this embodiment<br>
of the invention, flow gates 212 and 216 swing substantially in parallel and therefore may<br>
be operated by a single actuator.<br>
Length and Strength Fiber Testing<br>
Referring again to Fig. 9, the first increment of belt movement following extraction<br>
of a fiber subsample beard 161 by a carrier belt comb 162, stops the belt comb in front of a<br>
first grooming station 166. This first grooming station 166 preferably comprises a rotary<br>
carding cylinder 167 having stiff wire bristles to rectify the individual fibers of a beard and<br>
remove entangled fiber clusters called "neps." An air draft may be drawn over the rotating<br>
carding cylinder to cleanse the cylinder bristles of neps and loose fiber.<br>
A second advancement increment of the carrier belt positions the belt carried comb<br>
holding the carded beard 161 in alignment with the translation path of a rotary brushing<br>
station 168. The brushing station 168 is mounted on linear bearings 169 for controlled<br>
movement driven by a second stepping motor not shown between an operative position<br>
most proximate of the belt carried comb 162 and an inoperative position that is more<br>
remote from the comb, 162 path of movement. The previously carded beard is now drawn<br>
into a nip between a finer, pliable bristle rotary brush 154 and a cooperative plate 156.<br>
When the brushing interval is complete, the brushing station 168 is withdrawn from the belt<br>
along the translation path determined by the linear bearing 169.<br>
The third advancement increment of the carrier belt 160 aligns the combed and<br>
brushed beard 161 projecting from the belt carried comb 162 with a specimen slot 230 (not<br>
depicted in Fig. 9) in the length/strength tester 170. As a unit, the length/strength tester 170<br>
is reciprocated along a linear bearing 176 by a third stepping motor, also not shown. With<br>
respect to Figs. 10 through 16, the tester 170 is enclosed by a housing having a front wall<br>
plate 232. With particular reference to Fig. 14, the housing front wall plate supports a<br>
rigid, light guide plate 233 with a "floating" mount that permits the glass light guide 233 a<br>
limited degree of independent movement relative to the front wall plate 232. A slot 230 in<br>
the guide plate 233 divides the plate between an upper light guide section 234 and a lower<br>
light guide section 236. The upper edge 238 of the glass upper light guide section 234 is a<br>
diffusive light receptor having a frosted, concave surface. Along the focal axis of the<br>
receptor concavity is an array of multiple light emitting diodes (LED) 240. Along the lower<br>
edge of the lower light guide 236 is an elongated, large area photo sensor 242. The<br>
critically sensitive elements of this light sensor are relatively fixed for alignment<br>
maintenance therefore. A draft pipe 244 draws air from within the housing to stimulate an<br>
air draft into the beard slot 230. As the tester front wall advances by rotation of the<br>
stepping motor along the linear bearing 176 toward the carrier belt, the air draft into the<br>
slot 230 assures penetration of the slot 230 by the beard 161.<br>
Penetration of the slot 230 by the beard 161 blocks a calibrated light transmission<br>
from the upper light guide 234 into the lower light guide 236 thereby influencing the signal<br>
values emitted by the photo sensor 242. By coordinating the photo sensor signal values to<br>
the position of the tester unit 170 as the beard progresses into the slot 230, both the greatest<br>
fiber length and fiber length variation may be determined for the beard constituency. The<br>
angular positioning of the stepping motor drive signals the relative location of the testing<br>
unit 170 to the tester control program with great precision. Fiber length and fiber length<br>
variation values respective to each beard subsample extracted from the material mainstream<br>
are combined with a predetermined number of preceding values to generate a representative<br>
average value.<br>
It will be useful to review the data acquired from a sample beard by the<br>
length/strength test instrument. As the beard advances between the upper and lower light<br>
guides, the initial reduction in light transmission across the slot 230 detected by the photo<br><br>
sensor 242 signals arrival of the leading edge of the longest fiber in the beard. This arrival<br>
signal is correlated to the simultaneous stepping motor signal for a positional reference<br>
point. This correlation continues until the photo sensor 242 signals remain substantially<br>
unchanging as beard penetration continues. The stepping motor signal at this positional<br>
point is noted by the control program to resolve a linear differential between the leading<br>
edge reference point and the signal stabilization point. It is inferred from the stable photo<br>
sensor signal that all fibers in the beard are at least long enough to interrupt the slot 230<br>
light transmission. Consequently, this position location of the slot designates the shortest<br>
fiber in the beard. Notwithstanding further penetration of the beard into the slot, no<br>
additional light transmission is lost. The linear distance between the reference point and the<br>
stabilization point, therefore, is the fiber length variation.<br>
The foregoing procedure may be expanded with an iterative calculus to correlate<br>
intermediate slot positions between the reference point and the stabilization point to a<br>
magnitude or percentage of light reduction respective to each linear increment in the overall<br>
differential for a length distribution appraisal.<br>
With the testing unit 170 at the most proximate location relative to the belt carried<br>
comb 162, the beard 161 is at a position of penetration into the slot 230 that passes the<br>
beard between two pair of vise jaws 250 and 252 (Fig. 16). Vise 250 has a fixed position<br>
with respect to a testing unit 170 frame supported by the linear bearing 176. Vise 252 is<br>
provided reciprocal movement with respect to the fixed position vise 250. The reciprocating<br>
movement of vise 252 is parallel with the linear bearing 176 movement. Fixed position vise<br>
250 comprises a fixed position lower jaw 250b and a moving upper jaw 250a. Two laterally<br>
balanced pairs of air cylinders 260 are secured to the fixed position lower jaw 250b. Piston<br>
actuated rods 262 projecting from each cylinder 260 are secured to the moving upper jaw<br>
250a of the fixed position vise 250. Opposed vise jaw bars 254a and 254b, secured to the<br>
moving upper jaw 250a and to the fixed position lower jaw 250b, respectively, are aligned<br>
with the plane of the beard slot 230 and when open, receive the beard 161 therebetween.<br>
The moving vise 252 also comprises a fixed position lower jaw 252b and a moving<br>
upper jaw 252a. Air cylinders 264 are secured to the fixed position lower jaw 252b. Piston<br>
rods 266 projecting from the respective cylinders 264, are secured to a moving upper jaw<br>
252a. Vise jaw bar 256a is secured to the moving upper jaw 252a above the beard<br><br>
penetration plane and vise jaw bar 256b is secured to the fixed position lower jaw 252b<br>
below the beard penetration plane.<br>
A reciprocating transmission mechanism such as a jack screw or worm and rack<br>
secured to and between the lower jaw 250b of the fixed position vise 250 and the lower jaw<br>
252b of the moving vise 252 is driven by a highly accurate stepping motor 174. A<br>
calibration magnet 268 secured to the lower jaw of the moving vise 252 cooperates with a<br>
calibration switch 269 to maintain the accuracy of relative displacement measurements<br>
between the fixed and moving vises implied from the angular position signals for the<br>
stepping motor. Additionally, the transmission mechanism is secured to the moving vise<br>
252 through a load or force measuring cell 270. A floating joint 272 accommodates<br>
calibration adjustments between the load cell 270 and the moving vise 252.<br>
For consistent and meaningful fiber elongation and strength measurement, it is<br>
preferable that the number of fibers subjected to failure stress be known or at least a<br>
consistent number isolated for measurement. From the length and length distribution data<br>
obtained from the light sensor, a beard 161 plan may be visualized as shown by Fig. 25.<br>
Within the beard plan, the position of a planar line 163 may be located relative to the<br>
reference plane. The position of this line 163 is selected to cross a predetermined total<br>
number of fibers, regardless of the fiber distribution sequence across the beard plan. The<br>
testing unit 170 position, therefore, is adjusted relative to the beard 161 to align the plane<br>
of line 163 between the beard clamping jaws 254 and 256. Here, the air cylinders 260 and<br>
264 are charged with pressurized air to close the moving jaws 250a and 252a toward the<br>
respective stationary jaws 250b and 252b. Consequently, a substantially consistent number<br>
of fibers in the beard 161 is clamped between respective pairs of vise jaw bars 254 and 256.<br>
While clamped, the stepping motor 174 drives the transmission to separate the moving vise<br>
jaw set 252 from the fixed position vise jaws 250. A cumulative count of the stepping<br>
motor arc pulses multiplied by the transmission ratio determines the linear distance of the<br>
jaw pair separation wjth considerable precision. Simultaneous with the jaw-peparation, the<br>
load cell 270 senses and transmits to the control computer the force values required to<br>
continue the fiber elongation. This force monitored elongation of the subsample beard is<br>
continued until rupture. When the beard breaks between the two pairs of clamping bars 254<br>
and 256, the value of fiber elongation and maximum strength has been determined.<br><br>
Thereafter, the control computer directs the vise cylinders to open. The severed beard end<br>
that had been clamped between clamping bars 256 is removed by the slot 230 draft through<br>
the draft pipe 244. The fore end of the beard 161 remains secured to the belt carried comb<br>
162. As depicted in Fig. 9, a subsequent advancement of the belt 160 aligns the comb 162<br>
with a beard disposal station 172. Here the fiber clamping mechanism of the comb 162 is<br>
opened and the beard residual is removed by the operation of a brush and vacuum.<br>
Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize the value in positioning the on-line<br>
length/strength measuring system of Figs. 9-16 before and after the most critical cotton<br>
processing such as drying and ginning. In particular, it is useful to know if the average<br>
fiber length in a flow system is being reduced in transit through a set dryer sequence.<br>
Similarly, if fiber emerging from the gin stand suffers an average strength reduction,<br>
certain upstream process changes may be in order.<br>
Micronaire Testing<br>
Basis for a micronaire value is derived from Koxeny"s equation which provides a<br>
credible approximation for the permeability of powders having a negligible number of<br>
"blind" pores. See The American Institute of Physics Handbook. This equation<br>
characterizes the relationship of air flow resistance over a surface with a known mass in a<br>
known volume.<br>
M = (RM)X<br>
where, over a sample weight range of 8 to 12 grams:<br>
M = Corrected micronaire value<br>
RM = Raw micronaire value<br>
HMC = High calibration cotton value<br>
LMC = Low calibration cotton value<br>
LMP = Pressure of low calibration cotton value<br>
HMP = Pressure of high calibration cotton value<br>
P = Pressure of cotton under test<br>
W = Weight of cotton under test, grams<br>
With respect to the example of Fig. 3, erection of the flapper element 130 provides<br>
a localized pressure region to complement an external draft drawn through the shunting<br>
duct 180 for extraction of a mainstream material sample into the micronaire testing<br>
apparatus. Figs. 17 through 19 illustrate a sample extraction apparatus that exploits a<br>
perforated baffle 280 to establish a localized pressure zone around the opening 182 into the<br>
micronaire shunting duct 180. Like the flapper 130, the perforated baffle 280 is selectively<br>
rotated into and from an operative position within the duct 110 mainstream by a computer<br>
controlled rotary actuator not shown.<br>
A first of our micronaire testing instruments comprises a cylinder bore 292 having<br>
pistons 294 and 296 to delineate the opposite axial ends of the piston bore 292. Each of the<br>
pistons 294 and 296 is reciprocable between an extended position and a retracted position<br>
relative to respective air pressure actuating cylinders 295 and 297. Either or both of the<br>
pistons 294 and 296 are perforated or porous for substantially free passage of air<br>
therethrough. However, such perforations are sufficiently small to block and retain any lint<br>
in an air flow stream passing therethrough. Between the rod-end face 298 of the cylinder<br>
295 and the rod side of the piston 294 is an air flow rectification mechanism not shown that<br>
will permit an ingress of air flow into the cylinder bore 292 when the piston 294 is<br>
extended from the actuating cylinder 295. Such a mechanism may be an orifice through the<br>
wall of the cylinder bore 292 that is covered or otherwise closed by the piston 294 when in<br>
the retracted position.<br>
In a presently preferred embodiment of this micronaire test apparatus, the<br>
micronaire cylinder bore diameter is about 1.5 inches. Axial length of a mid-length sample<br><br>
collection zone X of the cylinder bore 192 is about 6.0 inches. Between the face plane of<br>
the retracted piston 294 and the upstream delineation plane of the collection zone X, the<br>
sample shunting duct 180 penetrates the wall of the micronaire cylinder bore 292 at an<br>
intersection angle sufficiently small to allow a smooth transition of fluidized lint from the<br>
shunting duct 180 into the cylinder bore 292. Similarly, a vacuum draft duct 300 penetrates<br>
the wall of the cylinder bore 292 at a low angle of intersection between the downstream<br>
delineation plane of the sample collection zone X and the face of the retracted piston 296.<br>
Within the sample collection zone X of the micronaire test bore 292 is a pressure<br>
differential measuring zone Y that is about 4.0 inches long. Referring to Fig. 20, the<br>
cylinder bore wall 292 is perforated about its circumference by two planar aligned aperture<br>
groups 302 and 304. The upstream group of apertures 302 open into an upstream manifold<br>
collar 306. The downstream group of apertures 304 open into a downstream manifold<br>
collar 308. The two manifold collars are operatively connected to a pressure differential<br>
signal transmitter 310.<br>
An operational cycle of the micronaire test apparatus may begin with retraction of<br>
the upstream perforated piston 294 and extension of the downstream perforated piston 296<br>
as illustrated by Fig. 17. Additionally, the valve disc 184 is turned by the rotary actuator<br>
186 into planar alignment with the axis of shunting duct 180 to open the shunting duct into<br>
the sample collection zone X of micronaire cylinder bore 292. When a vacuum is drawn<br>
within the draft duct 300, an air flow through the perforated piston 296 draws fiber from<br>
the duct 110, through the shunting duct 180 and into the sample collection zone X.<br>
Entrained fiber is screened from this flow stream against the face of downstream piston 296<br>
and accumulates within the sample collection zone X. As the accumulation grows and<br>
compresses, resistance to air flow through the accumulation increases accordingly. The<br>
quantity of accumulation is related to the pressure differential across the accumulated mass.<br>
When the pressure differential between the upstream apertures 302 and the downstream<br>
apertures 304, as monitored by the pressure differential transmitter 310, increases to a<br>
predetermined threshold level representative of a sufficient accumulation for a micronaire<br>
test, the control computer transmits a command signal to the rotary actuator 186 to close<br>
the disc valve 184. Sequentially, the upstream actuating cylinder 295 is activated to extend<br>
the upstream piston 294. At this point, both pistons 294 and 296 are fully extended to<br><br>
define a variable, albeit, determinable, volume Z within the cylinder bore 292. This<br>
volume Z is occupied by a substantially known quantity of compacted fiber.<br>
It will be recalled that when the upstream piston 294 is fully retracted, exterior air<br>
passages into the cylinder bore 192 interior are closed. When the upstream piston 294 is<br>
extended, these exterior air passages are opened. Now, the air flow drawn by the vacuum<br>
draft duct 300 arrives from behind the upstream piston 294 and passes through the piston<br>
perforations into the accumulated fiber mass between the two piston faces. See Fig. 18.<br>
Since pressure loss through the pistons is either negligible or a calibrated value, air<br>
pressure loss through the compressed fiber mass along the axial length of volume Z is<br>
measured by the pressure differential transmitter 320. The control computer receives a<br>
signal from the transmitter 320 corresponding to the pressure differential value along the<br>
axial length of volume Z.<br>
Referring to Fig. 19, after the second pressure differential is measured by<br>
transmitter 320, downstream piston 296 is retracted by the actuating cylinder 297 thereby<br>
opening the vacuum draft duct 300 directly into the cylinder bore 292. No longer<br>
restrained by the face of piston 296, the accumulated fiber mass moves as a plug into the<br>
draft duct 300. Duct 300 transports the plug to a weight scale 312. Signals corresponding<br>
to the fiber plug weight are transmitted to the control computer 200 for coordination with<br>
the signal value from the pressure differential transmitter 310 to resolve the micronaire<br>
value for this sample.<br>
Another embodiment of the micronaire test apparatus is shown by the exploded<br>
assembly illustration of Fig. 22. This arrangement requires only one fiber sample supply<br>
duct 278 that opens into a main tube body 274. An air draft flowing from the primary<br>
carrier duct (not depicted) passes along the main tube body 274, through the concentrically<br>
aligned measurement chamber 276 and through a pair of diametrically opposite, screened<br>
ports 282 of the flow control ball element 287. The ball element 287 also has an open port<br>
aperture 285. In a first rotary position controlled by a rotary actuator nor shown, the<br>
screened ports 282 are open through the valve body 284. A second rotary position of the<br>
ball element 287, oriented 90° to the first, aligns the open port aperture 285 through the<br>
valve body 284.<br>
A pressure differential measuring apparatus such as that described with respect to<br>
Fig. 20 is provided in the measurement chamber 276. Coaxially aligned with the<br>
measurement chamber 276 is a porous or perforated sample compression piston 322 secured<br>
to the end of a piston rod 324. The rod 324 shaft has a sliding penetration through the cap<br>
325 for the main tube body 274. The exterior end of the compression piston rod 324 is<br>
secured to and positionally controlled by a position feedback air cylinder not shown. The<br>
position feed back air cylinder is mainly a double acting air cylinder having positive<br>
pressure driven displacement in either of opposite directions, selectively. In addition,<br>
however, the location of a displacement element such as a piston or rod is monitored<br>
relative to the cylinder or vice-versa. In either case, a position control signal is available to<br>
direct or report the relative location of a moving element such as the compression piston<br>
322.<br>
Cotton particles carried by the air draft from the primary transport duct are<br>
deposited against the screen of ball port 282. Accumulation of these particles within the<br>
measurement chamber 276 is detected and monitored by the pressure differential measuring<br>
apparatus of Fig. 20. When the predetermined pressure differential is detected<br>
corresponding to an adequate quantity of accumulated cotton sample, the control program<br>
terminates the air draft source and the entry of additional cotton into the measurement<br>
chamber. Next, the position feedback air cylinder advances the compression piston 322<br>
into the measurement chamber 276 to a predetermined pressure load against the<br>
accumulated sample. Simultaneously, the piston position is reported to the control program<br>
thereby providing essential data for determination of the sample volume. At this state, a<br>
known air flow rate is induced through the compressed sample, passing through the<br>
compression piston 322 and the screened ball ports 282. Air flow resistance is determined<br>
from the pressure loss across the compressed cotton sample as function of the known flow<br>
rate. In turn, the micronaire value is calculated by the computer 200 as a function of the<br>
flow resistance and other known parameters.<br>
With the airflow resistance concluded, the flow control ball element is rotated 90°<br>
to align the open port aperture 285. Further extension of the compression piston 322 by the<br>
position feedback air cylinder pushes the cotton sample out from the measurement chamber<br>
276 and into an automated weight station 312 such as described with respect to the Fig. 19<br><br>
embodiment. Such weight data may be referenced for mass verification. If desired, the<br>
extracted sample may also be discarded or recycled. In either case, upon discharge of the<br>
sample through the ball element 287, the ball element angular position is restored to the<br>
original sample, accumulation position.<br>
A third micronaire testing embodiment of the invention comprises the device of Fig.<br>
23 wherein a cotton sample core 129 is isolated from a larger accumulation 128 by a coring<br>
punch 330. The larger accumulation 128 may be consolidated by any of several known<br>
means such as a flapper 130 having a coring aperture 139. Aligned with the coring<br>
aperture 139 is the core punch 330 having an edged end 332. The punch body is reversibly<br>
translated by a hollow bore rod element 334 to selectively engage the edged end 332 with a<br>
circular sealing/cutting channel 336 in the duct wall 104. It is not essential that the core<br>
sample 129 be completely severed from the larger accumulation 128.<br>
Within the perimeter circumscribed by the channel 336 are one or more duct wall<br>
apertures 338 that may be open to the atmosphere. A slide plate mechanism 339 may be<br>
positioned on the exterior side of the duct wall 104 to selectively close the apertures 338 if<br>
and when desired. Coaxially aligned within the measuring chamber 344 of the coring<br>
punch 330 is a perforated compression piston 340. The piston 340 is axially positioned by<br>
a rod 342 that is secured to the compression piston 340 and coaxially confined within the<br>
interior of rod 334. An air evacuation duct 346 penetrates the cylindrical wall of the coring<br>
punch body 330. Air pressure (or vacuum) within the measuring chamber 344 is sensed<br>
and transmitted to the control computer by pressure transducer 348.<br>
This Fig. 23 embodiment of the micronaire invention is most useful in the overall<br>
process stream after the gin stand and lint cleaners where fully opened cotton samples may<br>
be obtained. Such fully opened samples are desired for assurance of uniform fiber density<br>
and sample consistency in the measuring chamber 344.<br>
Actuation of the punch body rod 334 is a simple, full stroke movement that is<br>
coordinated with the qompaction element 130. Positioning of the compression piston 340,<br>
however, is infinitely controlled between stroke limits within the measuring chamber 344<br>
by a feedback controlled air or electric motor, not shown, that drives the piston rod 342.<br>
One function of the piston 340 feedback control is to regulate the piston 340 pressure (or<br>
force) on the sample 129 within a predetermined set-point range. Secondly, the feedback<br><br>
control reports the piston 340 face position for determination of a corresponding measuring<br>
chamber volume of infinite variability between the extreme limits of the piston 340 stroke.<br>
With a sample 129 under the predetermined load of the compression piston 340<br>
while occupying a known volume within the measuring chamber, the corresponding sample<br>
129 weight is determined by algorithm. A known air flow rate drawn through the duct 346<br>
is coordinated with the corresponding chamber pressure measured by the transducer 348.<br>
From this data array, a "weightless" micronaire value may be calculated.<br>
As a further application of the Fig. 23 embodiment, cotton sample properties<br>
corresponding to prior at "maturity" values may be determined. According to the prior art<br>
"maturity value" measurement procedure, a known weight quantity of fully open cotton is<br>
compressed to a first predetermined volume, a known "low" air flow rate is drawn through<br>
the first compressed volume and the pressure differential noted. Subsequently, the same<br>
sample is further compressed to a second predetermined volume and a known "high" air<br>
flow rate is drawn through the second volume. The pressure differential of the "high" air<br>
flow volume is combined with that of the "low" air flow pressure differential value to<br>
calculate the fiber maturity value using a classical ASTM formula.<br>
A modified maturity value may be determined from an operational procedure using<br>
the Fig. 23 embodiment in which the compression piston 340 is programmed to two or<br>
more positions, progressively. At each of the preprogrammed piston positions definitive of<br>
a corresponding volume, the air flow rate through the sample, the pressure differential from<br>
the sample and the piston load are noted data. From the noted data, the cotton maturity<br>
value may be determined. This maturity value determination process may be incremental<br>
or continuous.<br>
