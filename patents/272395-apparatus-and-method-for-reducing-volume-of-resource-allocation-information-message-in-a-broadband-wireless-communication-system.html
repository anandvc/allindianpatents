APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR REDUCING VOLUME OF<br>
RESOURCE ALLOCATION INFORMATION MESSAGE IN A<br>
BROADBAND WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
Technical Field<br>
[1] The present invention relates generally to a broadband wireless communication<br>
system, and in particular, to an apparatus and method for reducing the volume of a<br>
resource allocation information message in a broadband wireless communication<br>
system.<br>
Background Art<br>
[2] A future-generation communication system called a 4th Generation (4G) system is<br>
under an active study to provide services with different Quality of Service (QoS) re-<br>
quirements to users at or above 100Mbps. An especially active research area concerns<br>
provisioning of high-speed services with mobility and QoS ensured to a Broadband<br>
Wireless Access (BWA) communication system such as a Wireless Local Area<br>
Network (WLAN) and a Wireless Metropolitan Area Network (WMAN). Such a major<br>
communication system is an Institute of Electrical and Electronics (IEEE) 802.16e<br>
system.<br>
[3] Main standards developed I &gt;y the IEEE 802.16 working groups are IEEE 802.16d<br>
and IEEE 802.16e that are categorized into single carrier, Orthogonal Frequency<br>
Division Multiplexing (OFDM), and Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access<br>
(OFDMA). The IEEE 802.16d e OFDMA standard defines DownLink (DL) and<br>
UpLink (UL) frame structures with time and frequency resources and radio channel<br>
status-based resource allocation in the frames in order to effectively transmit digital bit<br>
information to a receiver.<br>
[4] FIG. 1 illustrates a frame stricture in a conventional OFDMA communication<br>
system.<br>
[5] Referring to FIG. 1, an OFDMA frame includes a DL frame 110 and a UL frame<br>
120.<br>
[6] The DL frame 110 is composed of a preamble 111, a Frame Control Header (FCH)<br>
113, a DL-MAP 115, a UL-MAP 117, and DL data bursts 119.<br>
[7] The preamble 111 provides i iformation by which a Mobile Station (MS) acquires<br>
an initial synchronization and performs a cell search. The FCH 113 indicates a coding<br>
scheme for the DL-MAP 115 and the UL-MAP 117. The DL-MAP 115 provides a<br>
resource allocation information message for each MS and the UL-MAP 117 provides a<br>
resource allocation information message for control regions 121 of the UL frame 120<br>
and UL data bursts 123 to be transmitted from MSs. The DL data bursts 119 carry user<br>
data from a Base Station (BS) to MSs.<br>
[8] The UL frame 120 is corr posed of the control regions 121 and the UL data bursts<br>
123. The control regions 121 deliver control information required for communications<br>
from the MSs to the BS and the UL data bursts 123 carry user data from the MSs to the<br>
BS.<br>
[9] The control regions 121 include a ranging channel 151, a Channel Quality In-<br>
formation (CQI) channel 153, an ACKnowledge (ACK) channel 155, and a sounding<br>
channel 157.<br>
[10] An MS can transmit data to the BS without resource allocation from the BS on the<br>
ranging channel 151. The ranging channel 151 is used for an initial network entry, a<br>
handoff requests, or a resource allocation request. The CQI channel 153 notifies the BS<br>
of the DL channel status of the MS. The ACK channel 155 indicates to the BS whether<br>
the MS has received a DL data burst successfully. The sounding channel 157 is a<br>
region from which the BS acquires channel information about the MS.<br>
[11] In the above-described OFDMA frame structure, the MAP information and the data<br>
bursts compete for resources because the MAP regions with the resource allocation in-<br>
formation messages and the aser data bursts are configured in the same frame. The<br>
MAP information and the user bursts are in a trade-off relationship in terms of<br>
resources. This means that an the amount of the MAP information increases, the<br>
amount of resources are available to the user bursts decreases. Although the frame<br>
structure is dynamically vanible, the case is rare in real system implementation. Par-<br>
ticularly, the control regions 121 of the UL frame 120 tend to have the same con-<br>
figuration in every frame. Transmission of the same resource allocation information<br>
message in every frame lead;Â»to the decrease of resources available to data bursts,<br>
thereby decreasing the overall data rate of the system.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[33] Preferred embodiments of the present Invention will be described herein below with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following description, well-known<br>
functions or constructions are not described in detail since they would obscure the<br>
invention in unnecessary detail.<br>
[34] The present invention discloses an apparatus and method for increasing the data rate<br>
of a system by reducing the overhead of a resource allocation information message in a<br>
broadband wireless communk ation system. The following description will be made in<br>
the context of an OFDM A system, by way of example.<br>
[35] FIG. 2 is a block diagram of a transmitter of a BS in an OFDMA communication<br>
system according to the present invention.<br>
[36] Referring to FIG. 2, the transmitter includes a scheduler 201, a MAP generator 203,<br>
a channel encoder 205, a modulator 207, a resource mapper 209, an OFDM modulator<br>
211, a Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) 213, and a Radio Frequency (RF)<br>
transmitter 215.<br>
[37] The scheduler 201 generates scheduling information for a resource allocation to a<br>
DL data burst region, a UL data burst region, and UL information regions (hereinafter,<br>
"resource allocation scheduling; information"). The UL control regions include a<br>
ranging channel, a CQI channel, an ACK channel, and a sounding channel. The CQI<br>
channel is equivalent to a fast feedback channel. Particularly, the scheduler 201<br>
determines whether to generate information about the resource allocation to the UL<br>
control regions (hereinafter, "LL control region allocation information") in accordance<br>
with the present invention. The UL control region allocation information can be about<br>
the entire UL control regions or part of the UL control regions. When it is time to<br>
generate the UL control region allocation information or when the UL control region<br>
allocation information is changsd, the scheduler 201 controls the UL control region<br>
allocation information to be generated. Especially in the latter case, the scheduler 201<br>
controls the UL control region iillocation information to be generated in a pre-<br>
determined number of successive frames.<br>
[38] The MAP generator 203 generates a MAP message, i.e. a resource allocation in-<br>
formation message based on the resource allocation scheduling information received<br>
from the scheduler 201. Particularly the MAP generator 203 generates a MAP message<br>
according to whether the UL control region allocation information has been generated<br>
in the scheduler 201, i.e., if the UL control region allocation information is generated,<br>
the MAP generator 203 generates a MAP message including the UL control region<br>
allocation information. In this case, the MAP generator 203 includes valid duration in-<br>
formation associated with tht UL control region allocation information in the MAP<br>
message. On the other hand, f the UL control region allocation information is not<br>
generated, the MAP generator 203 generates a MAP message without the UL control<br>
region allocation information.<br>
[39] The channel encoder 205 encodes the resource allocation information message<br>
received from the MAP generator 203 at a predetermined coding rate. The modulator<br>
207 modulates the coded data received from the channel encoder 205 to symbols in a<br>
predetermined modulation scheme (e.g. Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK)).<br>
[40] The resource mapper 209 maps the symbols according to a frame structure, i.e., to<br>
subcarriers of a frame. The OFDM modulator 211 converts the mapped symbols, i.e.<br>
from a frequency signal to a t me signal by an Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT).<br>
[41] The DAC 213 converts the lime signal to an analog signal and the RF transmitter 215<br>
upconverts the analog signal to a carrier frequency and transmits the carrier-frequency<br>
signal through an antenna.<br>
[42] FIG. 3 is a block diagram of a receiver of an MS in the OFDMA communication<br>
system according to the present invention.<br>
[43] Referring to FIG. 3, the receiver includes an RF receiver 301, an Analog-to-Digital<br>
Converter (ADC) 303, an OFDM demodulator 305, a MAP extractor 307, a de-<br>
modulator 309, a channel decoder 311, and a MAP interpreter 313.<br>
[44] The RF receiver 301 downconverts an RF signal received through an antenna to a<br>
baseband signal and the ADC 303 converts the baseband signal to a digital signal.<br>
[45] The OFDM demodulator 30.5 converts the time signal received from the ADC 303 to<br>
a frequency signal by a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The MAP extractor 307 extracts<br>
a MAP signal from the frequency signal.<br>
[46] The demodulator 309 demodulates the MAP signal in a predetermined demodulation<br>
scheme and the channel decoder 311 decodes the demodulated MAP data at a pre-<br>
determined coding rate.<br>
[47] The MAP interpreter 313 interprets the MAP information received from the channel<br>
decoder 311 and updates infor nation about resources available to the MS. Especially<br>
the MAP interpreter 313 determines whether the MAP information includes UL<br>
control region allocation infon nation and updates stored UL control region allocation<br>
information corresponding^ in accordance with the present invention. In the presence<br>
of the UL control region allocation information in the MAP information, the MAP in-<br>
terpreter 313 updates the stored UL control region allocation information to the new<br>
UL control region allocation information. In the absence of the UL control region<br>
allocation information in the MAP information, the MAP interpreter 313 keeps the<br>
stored UL control region allocation information. In the case where the MAP message<br>
includes valid duration information, if tine new UL control region allocation in-<br>
formation has not been received until expiration of a valid duration indicated by the<br>
valid duration information, the MAP interpreter 313 deletes the stored UL control<br>
region allocation information Herein, UL control regions include a ranging channel, a<br>
CQI channel, an ACK channel, and a sounding channel. The CQI channel is equivalent<br>
to a fast feedback channel.<br>
[48] While not shown, a control signal transmitter carries out UL signaling (e.g. ranging,<br>
CQI, ACK, etc.) to the BS ba^ed on the UL control region allocation information.<br>
[491 FIG. 4 is a flowchart illustrating an operation in the BS for generating a resource<br>
allocation information message in the OFDMA communication system according to an<br>
exemplary embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[50] Referring to FIG. 4, the M/J* generator 203 determines whether it is time to<br>
generate a MAP message in stop 401. If it is time to generate a MAP message, the<br>
MAP generator 203 checks a I)L and UL resource allocation schedule in step 403.<br>
[51] In step 405, the MAP gener ator 203 determines whether UL control region<br>
allocation information has been changed by comparing UL control region allocation<br>
information set in the resource allocation schedule with the most recently transmitted<br>
UL control region allocation information. As stated before, UL control regions include<br>
a ranging channel, a CQI channel, an ACK channel, and a sounding channel, and the<br>
CQI channel is equivalent to a Fast feedback channel.<br>
[52] If the UL control region allocation information has been changed, the MAP generator<br>
203 sets a variable 'm' to 0 in stsp 407. The variable m indicates the number of frames<br>
without control region allocation information transmitted after the change of the UL<br>
control region allocation information.<br>
[53] In step 409, the MAP generator 203 generates a MAP message with the changed<br>
UL control region allocation information. The UL control region allocation in-<br>
formation may be about all or part of the ifL control regions.<br>
[54] On the other hand, if the UL control region allocation information has not been<br>
changed, the MAP generator 203 determines whether it is time to generate UL control<br>
region allocation information in step 411. Specifically, the MAP generator 203 counts<br>
the number of successive MAP ransmissions without UL control region allocation in-<br>
formation after a MAP transmission with UL control region allocation information and<br>
compares the count with a predetermined period for generating the UL control region<br>
allocation information. The period is a variable that depends on a system setting.<br>
[55] If it is time to generate UL control region allocation information in step 411, the<br>
MAP generator 203 generate: a MAP message with the UL control region allocation<br>
information checked in step 403 in step 409.<br>
[56] If it is not time to generate UL control region allocation information in step 411, the<br>
MAP generator 203 increases the variable m by 1 in step 413. If it is not time to<br>
generate UL control region allocation information after the increase of m, the MAP<br>
generator 203 compares m with a variable 'N' in step 415. N indicates the number of<br>
successive frames with UL control region allocation information to ensure reception of<br>
the changed UL control region allocation information, i.e., the changed UL control<br>
region allocation information is transmitted in N successive frames counted from the<br>
time when the UL control reg on allocation information has been changed. N depends<br>
on a system setting.<br>
[57] If m is less than N, the MAF generator 203 generates the MAP message with the UL<br>
control region allocation information in step 409.<br>
[58] If m is greater than or equal to N, the MAP generator 203 generates a MAP message<br>
without the UL control region allocation information in step 417.<br>
[59] FIG. 5 is a flowchart illustrating an operation in the MS for detecting a resource<br>
allocation information message in the OFDMA communication system according to an<br>
exemplary embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[60] Referring to FIG. 5, the MA P interpreter 313 monitors a reception of a MAP<br>
message in step 501.<br>
[61] Upon receipt of the MAP messsage, the MAP interpreter 313 determines whether the<br>
MAP message includes UL control region allocation information in step 503. UL<br>
control regions include a ranging channel, a CQI channel, an ACK channel, and a<br>
sounding channel, and the CQ [ channel is equivalent to a fast feedback channel.<br>
[62] In the presence of the UL control region allocation information, the MAP interpreter<br>
313 updates stored UL control region allocation information to the received UL control<br>
region allocation information in step 505<br>
[63] In the absence of the UL control region allocation information, the MAP interpreter<br>
313 keeps the stored UL control region allocation information in step 507.<br>
[64] The MAP interpreter 313 chtecks data burst region information in step 509 and then<br>
ends the algorithm of the present invention.<br>
[65] FIG. 6 is a flowchart illustrating an operation in the BS for generating a resource<br>
allocation information message in the OFDMA communication system according to<br>
another exemplary embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[66] Referring to FIG. 6, the MAP generator 203 determines whether it is time to<br>
generate a MAP message in step 601. If it is, the MAP generator 203 checks a DL and<br>
UL resource allocation schedule in step 603.<br>
[67] In step 605, the MAP generator 203 determines whether UL control region<br>
allocation information has been changed, by comparing UL control region allocation<br>
information set in the resource allocation schedule with the latest transmitted UL<br>
control region allocation infoimation. As stated before, UL control regions include a<br>
ranging channel, a CQI channel, an ACK channel, and a sounding channel, and the<br>
CQI channel is equivalent to sl fast feedback channel.<br>
[68] If the UL control region allocation information has been changed, the MAP generator<br>
203 generates valid duration i iformation for the UL control region allocation in-<br>
formation in step 607. Because transmitted UL control region allocation information is<br>
not valid after a duration of a period has elapsed, in the case of periodic transmission<br>
of UL control region allocation information, the MAP generator 203 generates valid<br>
duration information to notify an MS of the period.<br>
[69] In step 609, the MAP generator 203 generates a MAP message with the changed<br>
UL control region allocation information and the valid duration information. The UL<br>
control region allocation information may contain information about some or all of the<br>
UL control regions.<br>
[70] On the other hand, if the UL control region allocation information has not been<br>
changed in step 605, the MAP generator 203 determines whether it is time to generate<br>
UL control region allocation information in step 611. Specifically, the MAP generator<br>
203 counts the number of successive MAP transmissions without UL control region<br>
allocation information after a MAP transmission with UL control region allocation in-<br>
formation, and compares the count with the period. The period is a variable depending<br>
on a system setting.<br>
[71] If it is not time to generate UL control region allocation information in step 611, the<br>
MAP generator 203 generates a MAP message without the UL control region<br>
allocation information in step (513.<br>
[72] FIG. 7 is a flowchart illustrating an operation in the MS for detecting a resource<br>
allocation information messagi; in the OFDMA communication system according to<br>
another exemplary embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[73] Referring to FIG. 7, the MAI interpreter 313 monitors reception of a MAP message<br>
in step 701.<br>
[74] Upon receipt of the MAP me ssage, the MAP interpreter 313 determines whether the<br>
MAP message includes UL control region allocation information in step 703. UL<br>
control regions include a ranging channel, a CQI channel, an ACK channel, and a<br>
sounding channel, and the CQI channel is equivalent to a fast feedback channel.<br>
[75] In the presence of the UL control region allocation information, the MAP interpreter<br>
313 updates stored UL control region allocation information to the received UL control<br>
region allocation information in step 705.<br>
[76] In the absence of the UL control region allocation information, the MAP interpreter<br>
313 determines whether previous UL control region allocation information has been<br>
stored in step 707.<br>
[77] If the previous UL control region allocation information has been stored, the MAP<br>
interpreter 313 checks the valid duration of the stored UL control region allocation in-<br>
formation in step 709.<br>
[78] If the UL control region allocation information is still valid, the MAP interpreter 313<br>
keeps the stored UL control region allocation information in step 711.<br>
[79] On the contrary, if the UL control region allocation information is determined to be<br>
invalid in step 709, the MAP interpreter 313 deletes the stored UL control region<br>
allocation information in step 713. Since the UL control region allocation information<br>
whose valid duration has elapsed is not reliable, use of an area indicated by the UL<br>
control region allocation infonnation is prevented by deleting the UL control region<br>
allocation infonnation. Besides the deletion, a flag can be set in the MS to indicate<br>
whether the UL control region allocation information is valid, or the MS may always<br>
check the valid duration of thi: UL control region allocation information.<br>
[80] The MAP interpreter 313 detects data burst region information in step 715.<br>
[81] In the above-described embodiments of the present invention, UL control region<br>
allocation infonnation is periodically generated and included in a MAP message. Here,<br>
the UL control region allocation infonnation may describe resource allocation to the<br>
entire UL control regions or a specific control region such as a ranging region.<br>
[82] A third embodiment of the present invention is proposed in which the BS sets a valid<br>
duration indicator for each UL control region in generating MAP information. For<br>
instance, a Connection IDentiller (CID) included in a UL-MAP Information Element<br>
(UL-MAPJE) can be used as a valid duration indicator for allocation infonnation<br>
included in the UL-MAP_IE. For a UL-MAP_IE that provides initial ranging region<br>
infonnation, the BS setting '0000' in a CID included in the UL-MAP_IE may indicate<br>
that the initial ranging region information is valid until new initial ranging region in-<br>
formation is transmitted. The US setting the CID to 'ffff may indicate that the initial<br>
ranging region information is valid only in a frame carrying the UL-MAP_IE, i.e., the<br>
CID of a UL-MAP_IE can be jsed to indicate a valid duration used in the second<br>
embodiment of the present invention, i.e., if the CID is '0000' the valid duration lasts<br>
until a frame carrying new initial ranging region information is received. If the CID is<br>
'ffff, the valid duration is confined to one frame.<br>
[83] A fourth embodiment of the present invention can be contemplated, in which UL<br>
control region allocation infonnation is transmitted in a broadcast message. The<br>
broadcast message is broadcasted not in every frames. For example, an Uplink Channel<br>
Descriptor (UCD) message with an additional Type-Length-Value (TLV) illustrated in<br>
Table 1 below can be used.<br>
<br>
[85]<br>
<br>
[86] The broadcast message may include allocation information about at least one UL<br>
control region among pieces of information listed in Table 1, i.e., the broadcast<br>
message may include allocation information about a ranging region (an initial ranging<br>
region, a handover ranging region, a periodic ranging region, a bandwidth ranging<br>
region, etc.), a fast feedback legion in which a CQI is fed back, an HARQ ACK region<br>
in which an HARQ response signal is fed back, and a sounding region carrying a<br>
sounding signal. Allocation information about each UL control region may include an<br>
Allocation Information Elemrnt (IE), a Periodicity indicating a period for a UL control<br>
region, and an Allocation Phase indicating the start point of the periodicity. The Pe-<br>
riodicity is a parameter 'd' that defines periodicity in 2Ad frames and the Allocation<br>
Phase is expressed in frames in Table 1.<br>
[87] FIG. 8 is a flowchart illustrating an operation in the MS for detecting a resource<br>
allocation information message in the broadband wireless communication system<br>
according to a third exemplary embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[88] Referring to FIG. 8, the MAP interpreter 313 determines whether a received frame<br>
has a MAP message in step 801.<br>
[89] In the presence of the MAP message, the MAP interpreter 313 determines whether<br>
the MAP reception is normal jy a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) check on the<br>
MAP message in step 803.<br>
[90] If the MAP message is not normal, the MAP interpreter 313 controls the MS to be in-<br>
operative during the frame in step 805.<br>
[91] If the MAP message is normal, the MAP interpreter 313 determines whether UL<br>
control region allocation information exists in the MAP message in step 807.<br>
[92] In the presence of the UL control region allocation information, the MAP interpreter<br>
313 updates current UL control region allocation information with the received UL<br>
control region allocation information in step 809 and stores the updated UL control<br>
region allocation information in step 811, i.e., the MAP interpreter 313 updates the<br>
stored previous UL control region allocation information to the new UL control region<br>
allocation information.<br>
[93] In the absence of the UL control region allocation information in step 807, the MAP<br>
interpreter 313 determines whether a UCD includes UL control region allocation in-<br>
formation in step 813.<br>
[94] In the presence of the UL control region allocation information in the UCD, the MAP<br>
interpreter 313 stores the UL control region allocation information in step 811, i.e., the<br>
MAP interpreter 313 updates the existing UL control region allocation information to<br>
the new UL control region allocation information.<br>
[95] After storing the UL control region allocation information, the MAP interpreter 313<br>
acquires a MAP IE for the M S in step 815.<br>
[96] As is apparent from the above description, the present invention advantageously<br>
increases the data rate of user data by reducing the volume of resource allocation in-<br>
formation messages by periodically transmitting a resource allocation information<br>
message associated with a specific region among resource allocation information<br>
messages directed from a BS to an MS in a broadband wireless communication system.<br>
[97] While the invention has bee a shown and described with reference to certain preferred<br>
embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various<br>
changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and<br>
scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.<br>
