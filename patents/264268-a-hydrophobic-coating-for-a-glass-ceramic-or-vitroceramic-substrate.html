				<td>HYDROPHOBIC COATING COMPRISING A PRIMING INCLUDING A<br>
BIS-SILANE AND A HYDROPHOBIC LAYER INCLUDING A<br>
FLUORINATED ALKYLSILANE<br>
The present invention relates to the hydrophobic/oleo-<br>
phobic treatment of a substrate, especially constituted<br>
by a glass, ceramic, vitroceramic, etc. material.<br>
The glazing according to the invention is, for example,<br>
glazing made of glass. It is used, in particular, in<br>
the aeronautics, railway or automotive fields. It may<br>
also be used in the construction field or in the<br>
interior furnishing field, for instance decorative<br>
panels, for furnishing, household electrical goods<br>
(refrigerator doors, oven doors, windowpanes), etc.<br>
This type of treatment is directed, in a known manner,<br>
toward giving the substrate the non-wettabi.l.i ty<br>
character also known as rain repellency.<br>
The term "wettability" denotes the property according<br>
to which polar or nonpolar liquids adhere to the<br>
substrate and form an impeding film, and aJ so the<br>
tendency of a substrate to retain dust or soiling of<br>
any nature, finger marks, insects, etc.<br>
The presence of water and/or soiling is a nuisance in<br>
particular for a transparent substrate of the glazing<br>
type, especially used in the transportation field.<br>
The non wettability property of a substrate, more<br>
commonly referred to as the hydrophobicity/oleo-<br>
phobicity, is proportionately greater the higher the<br>
contact angles between a hydrophilic or oleophilic<br>
liquid and this substrate, for example at least 90° for<br>
water. The liquid then has a tendency to flow easily,<br>
in the form of drops, on the substrate, by simple<br>
gravity if the substrate is inclined, or under the<br>
effect of aerodynamic forces in the case of a vehicle<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
in motion. Known agents for imparting this<br>
hydrophobicity/oleophobicity property are, for example,<br>
fluorinated alkylsilanes as described in patent<br>
applications EP 0 492 417, EP 0 492 545 and EP<br>
0 672 779. According to these documents, this layer may<br>
bo obtained by applying to the surface of a substrate a<br>
solution containing fluorinated organosilanes in a<br>
nonaqueous organic solvent. As nonaqueous organic<br>
solvent, document EP 0 4 92 545 in particular mentions<br>
n hexadecane, toluene, xylene, etc. These solvents are<br>
particularly suitable for a fluorinated chlorosilane.<br>
It is also possible, according to said document, to use<br>
a methyl or ethyl alcohol as solvent when the<br>
fluorinated silane is a fluorinated alkoxysilane.<br>
Common hydrophobic/oleophobic agents are, in<br>
particular, alkylsilanes in which the alky] group<br>
comprises at least one perfluorinated end, i.e.<br>
consisting of a group F3C-(CF2)n-, in which n is a<br>
positive integer or zero. For these, patent application<br>
EP 0 719 743 indicates perfluorinated carbons and<br>
suitable solvents.<br>
One of the problems most acutely perceived in the field<br>
of the invention is firstly that of abrasion of the<br>
hydrophobic/oleophobic coating. This abrasion takes<br>
place to a greater or lesser extent in the course of<br>
cleaning of the substrate, which is periodically<br>
essential in particular for restoring satisfactory<br>
vision through a transparent substrate. It is therefore<br>
continually sought to slow down the gradual removal of<br>
the hydrophobic/oleophobic coatings of the<br>
abovementioned types, which takes place especially<br>
under the action of windshield wipers in the case of a<br>
motor vehicle windshield. Moreover, such a removal may<br>
also result from degradation by ultraviolet radiation.<br>
It is also known practice from the abovementioned<br>
patent application EP 0 492 545 A2 to increase the<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
adhesion of the hydrophobic/oleophobic coating by-<br>
subjecting the substrate to a priming treatment before<br>
applying the coating. This treatment consists in<br>
forming a thin intermediate layer using "priming<br>
agents" or "primers", which are silicon compounds<br>
containing at least two hydrolyzable functions. In a<br>
known manner, one of the two hydrolyzable functions<br>
enables chemical bonding to the substrate via an oxygen<br>
atom linked to the silicon atom; the second<br>
hydrolyzable function enabling the fixing of the<br>
hydrophobic/oleophobic agent. The compounds SiCl4,<br>
SiHCl3, SiH2Cl2 and CI- (SiCl20) nSiCl3, n being an integer<br>
between 1 and 4, are mentioned in patent application EP<br>
0	492 545 A2 as priming agents.<br>
Patent EP 944 687 more particularly describes rain-<br>
ropellent coatings developed via a liquid route and<br>
comprising a priming layer or sublayer based on silica<br>
sol gel obtained from a precursor of the Si(OEt)4 or<br>
S.LC 1-4 type and a functional layer based on perfluoro-<br>
aIkylsilane.<br>
In order to further improve the mechanical strength<br>
properties of the hydrophobic coating, patent EP<br>
1	102 825 describes a composition for a hydrophobic/<br>
oleophobic coating incorporating in the same layer both<br>
a fluorinated alkylsilane and a bis-silane.<br>
However, although such sublayers make it possible to<br>
obtain performance qualities that are in accordance<br>
with the vast majority of the current UV and mechanical<br>
strength specifications, for instance those imposed by<br>
motor vehicle constructors, especially with respect to<br>
abrasion, they do not generally have sufficient<br>
chemical inertness typically allowing them to satisfy<br>
salt corrosion resistance criteria.<br>
in particular, the tests conducted by the Applicant<br>
have demonstrated that, in the majority of cases, such<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
coatings have difficulty in satisfying the technical<br>
specifications imposed in the field by motor vehicle<br>
constructors .and measured, for example, via the Neutral<br>
Saline Fog (NSF) resistance test according to standard<br>
NF ISO 9227. Thus, the coatings described in patent<br>
applications EP 944 687 and EP 1 102 825, the UV<br>
resistance and mechanical strength properties of which<br>
wore found to be satisfactory, show insufficient saline<br>
corrosion performance, as measured by the NSF test.<br>
This insufficiency may limit their development, in<br>
particular in the Asiatic market where the standards<br>
arc tighter in this field.<br>
The main subject of the present invention is coatings<br>
that are not only resistant to abrasion and to UV<br>
radiation, but also show substantial chemical<br>
inertness, i.e. typically allowing them to satisfy the<br>
technical specifications currently imposed by the<br>
automotive industry, both in terms of abrasion and UV<br>
resistance and saline corrosion resistance. The<br>
coatings according to the present invention also have<br>
performance qualities substantially equal to those of<br>
the coatings known at the present time as regards the<br>
other specifications necessary for their various uses,<br>
for instance mechanical strength, water resistance,<br>
etc.<br>
To this end, according to a first aspect, a subject of<br>
the invention is a process for obtaining a hydrophobic/<br>
oleophobic coating on a substrate preferably<br>
constituted of a glass, ceramic or vitroceramic<br>
material, said process being characterized in that it<br>
comprises:<br>
a) a first step that consists in applying to said<br>
substrate a first priming layer obtained from a<br>
priming agent of formula:<br>
(X1)3-q(R1)qSi-R3-Si(X2)3_q, (R2)q-<br>
in which<br>
Si is silicon;<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
R3 represents a linear, branched or aromatic,<br>
preferably linear, carbon-based chain in which<br>
the number of carbons establishing the bond<br>
between the two silicon atoms is less than 6<br>
and is preferably between 1 and 4;<br>
R1 and R2 each represent an alkyl group or a<br>
hydrogen atom;<br>
X1 and X2 are identical or different<br>
hydrolyzable groups;<br>
q and q' are equal to 0 or 1 and are preferably<br>
0, and<br>
b) a second step of depositing onto said first layer<br>
a hydrophobic coating comprising at least one<br>
fluorinated alkylsilane.<br>
For the purposes of the present description, the<br>
expression "number of carbons establishing the bond<br>
between two silicon atoms" means the smallest number of<br>
carbon atoms allowing the linear junction between two<br>
silicon atoms, rather than the total number of carbon<br>
atoms placed between the two silicons. This definition<br>
is especially relevant when a branched or aromatic-ring<br>
group is present therebetween. By way of example, this<br>
number of carbons is equal to 8 in the case of the bis<br>
si lylethyIbenzene described in example 8.<br>
In general, X1 and X2 are alkoxy groups, preferably<br>
methoxy or ethoxy, or halide groups.<br>
The step of depositing the hydrophobic coating is<br>
performed, for example, using a solution obtained from<br>
a porfluoroalkylsilane of the type represented by the<br>
general formula:<br>
F3C- (CF2)m- (CH2)n-Si(X)3-p(R)P<br>
in which:<br>
m = 0 to 15, preferably 5 to 9;<br>
n - 1 to 5, preferably n = 2 ,-<br>
p = 0, 1 or 2, preferably 0 or 1 and most preferably<br>
0;<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
R is an alkyl group or a hydrogen atom; and<br>
X is a hydrolyzable group such as a halide group or<br>
an alkoxy group.<br>
According to one alternative mode, the step of<br>
depositing the hydrophobic coating is performed using a<br>
solution obtained from a perfluoroalkylsilane of the<br>
perfluoropolyethersilane type, as described, for<br>
example, in patent EP 844 265 or in patent application<br>
US 2004/0 247 886 or patent US 6 649 272 B2.<br>
Preferably, said perfluoropolyethersilane is of the<br>
type represented by the general formula:<br><br>
or by the general formula<br><br>
in which:<br>
m = 2 to 30;<br>
n = 1 to 3, preferably n = 1;<br>
p = 0, 1 or 2, preferably 0 or 1 and most preferably<br>
0;<br>
R is an alkyl group or a hydrogen atom; and<br>
X is a hydrolyzable group such as a halide group or<br>
an alkoxy group.<br>
According to a second aspect, the present invention<br>
relates to the hydrophobic coating that may be obtained<br>
by performing the process as described previously.<br>
The invention more particularly relates to a<br>
hydrophobic coating for a glass, ceramic or vitro-<br>
ceramic substrate, and comprising:<br>
a priming layer directly applied onto said<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
substrate and comprising groups Si-R3-Si, R! being<br>
chosen from the group constituted by linear,<br>
branched or aromatic, preferably linear, alkyl<br>
chains in which the number of carbon atoms<br>
establishing the bond between the two silicon<br>
atoms is less than 6 and is preferably between 1<br>
and 4,<br>
a coating layer in connection with said priming<br>
layer and comprising an alkylsilane with a<br>
hydrophobic/oleophobic perfluorinated end.<br>
According to a first mode, said alkylsilane is of the<br>
type represented by the general formula:<br><br>
with :<br>
m = 0 to 15, preferably 5 to 9 ;<br>
n = 1 to 5, preferably n = 2.<br>
According to ' a second mode, said alkylsilane comprises<br>
a group of the perfluoropolyether type. Preferably,<br>
said alkylsilane is of the type represented by the<br>
general formula:<br><br>
or by the general formula:<br><br>
in which<br>
- m = 2 to 30,<br>
n. = 1 to 3; preferably n = 1.<br>
The hydrophobic layer may also comprise or may be<br>
constituted by a mixture of an alkylsilane with a<br>
perf luorinated end according to the first mode and of<br>
an alkylsilane comprising a perfluoropolyether group<br>
according to the second mode, as described, for<br>
example, in patent application EP 1 229 085.<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
For example, the thickness of the priming layer is<br>
between 1 and 2 0 nm and preferably between 2 and 5 nm.<br>
The thickness of the coating layer may be between 1 and<br>
10 nm and preferably between 1 and 5 nm.<br>
Another subject of the invention consists of a product<br>
whose outer surface, usually constituted by a glass,<br>
ceramic or vitroceramic material or a natural mineral<br>
material, is at least partly equipped with a<br>
hydrophobic/oleophobic coating as described previously<br>
or obtained from a process as described previously.<br>
The product of the invention is, for example,<br>
monolithic, laminated or multiple glazing.<br>
It is pointed out that these terms are defined as<br>
fo1 Lows:<br>
"monolithic glazing": glazing constituted by a single<br>
pane of glass;<br>
"Laminated glazing": a stack of several panes solidly<br>
fastened together, for example of glass or plastic<br>
panes fixed together by means of polyvinyl butyral,<br>
polyurethane, etc. adhesive layers; and<br>
"multiple glazing": an assembly of disjointed panes,<br>
i.e. of panes especially separated from each other by<br>
layers of air.<br>
The advantage of the hydrophobic/oleophobic coating of<br>
the invention for products of this type is twofold.<br>
F.i rstly, it allows drops of water or of other liquid to<br>
flow on vertical or inclined surfaces, under the<br>
effect, as the case may be, of aerodynamic forces, for<br>
example in the case of a vehicle in motion.<br>
Furthermore, these drops that flow incorporate soiling<br>
and entrains it. The visibility through the glazing is.<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
improved to a degree such that, in certain cases,<br>
cleaning devices (windshield washers, windshield<br>
wipers) may be dispensed with.<br>
Finally, a 'subject of the invention is also the<br>
applications of the product described previously:<br>
as glazing for a transportation vehicle (motor<br>
vehicle side windows, aviation or motor vehicle<br>
windshield) or for buildings;<br>
as vitroceramic cooking hobs or oven doors,-<br>
as a component of urban furnishing, especially such<br>
as a bus shelter component; and<br>
as a furnishing component, especially such as a<br>
mirror, a storage tray, a tray for a household<br>
electrical appliance such as a refrigerator, a shower<br>
cabin component or a partition wall;<br>
as a screen, especially a television screen, a touch<br>
screen or a plasma screen.<br>
The examples that follow serve to illustrate the<br>
invention without, however, limiting its scope, in any<br>
of the described aspects.<br>
In these examples, all the percentages are given on a<br>
mass basis.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
According to this example, a first sample El in<br>
accordance with the invention is prepared.<br>
0.3% of bis(triethoxysilyl)ethane<br>
(CH,0)3Si (CH2)2Si (OCH3)3 is added to a solution<br>
comprising 90% isopropanol and 10% 0. 3N hydrochloric<br>
a c i d .<br>
In parallel, a solution containing 3% of perfluoro-<br>
dccyltriethoxysilane CF3 (CF2) 7 (CH2) 2Si (OC2H5) 3 in an<br>
isopropanol (90%)/0.3N hydrochloric acid (10%) mixture<br>
is prepared. The two solutions are stirred for<br><br>
- 10 -<br>
1b minutes.<br>
According to a first deposition step, the bis(tri<br>
cthoxysilyl)ethane-based solution is then deposited by<br>
wiping (4 crossed sweeps) over the air face of a glass<br>
substrate polished beforehand using a cerium oxide<br>
solution and then rinsed thoroughly with demineralized<br>
water. The thickness of the priming layer thus obtained<br>
is about 4 nm.<br>
Once the sublayer has been deposited, the perfluoro-<br>
dccyltriethoxysilane solution is in turn deposited via<br>
the same wiping technique. In this example and in the<br>
following examples, the deposition of the various<br>
layers is performed via the well-known technique of<br>
wiping, in which the material or its precursor is<br>
deposited by means of a soaked cloth. Needless to say,<br>
it, would not, however, constitute a departure from the<br>
scope of the invention if the deposition were to be<br>
performed by any other technique known for this purpose<br>
in the field, in particular by spraying, which moreover<br>
al lows better control of the thickness of the layers,<br>
by centrifugation, according to processes known in the<br>
art under the term "spin-coating", by dip-coating or by<br>
f: 1 ow-coating.<br>
After a leave-on time of 15 minutes at room<br>
temperature, the excess fluorosilane is removed by<br>
cleaning with isopropanol. The thickness of the layer<br>
obtained is about 4 nm.<br>
As a variant, another sample E2 was prepared using the<br>
same reagents and techniques, the difference being that<br>
the successive depositions were performed this time on<br>
the tin face of the glass substrate.<br>
EXAMPLE 2:<br>
The same steps as previously are repeated for the<br>
preparation of a second sample E3, but the glass<br><br>
- 11 -<br>
substrate is treated this time on its air face with a<br>
priming solution of Si(OCH3)4 at 0.4% by weight in a<br>
solution of 90% by weight of ethanol and 10% by weight<br>
of water, during the first deposition step.<br>
The substrate thus coated with the sublayer is then<br>
placed in contact at room temperature with a solution<br>
containing 3% of CF3 (CF2) 7 (CH2) 2Si (OC2H5) 3 in a mixture of<br>
90% ethanol and 10% water, acidified with 0.3N HC1.<br>
EXAMPLE 3:<br>
A third sample E4 is prepared according to a method<br>
identical to the previous methods and in accordance<br>
with the teachings of patent EP 1 102 825.<br>
The glass substrate, identical to the one used in the<br>
preceding examples and having undergone the same<br>
preparation on its air face, is treated with a priming<br>
solution of Si(OCH3)4 at 0.4% by weight in a solution of<br>
90% by weight of ethanol and 10% by weight of water.<br>
The substrate and its priming are then placed in<br>
contact at room temperature with a solution of<br>
CI.', (CF2)7(CH2)2Si(OC2H5)3 and (CH30) 3Si (CH2) 2Si (OCH3) 3 in<br>
respective proportions of 3% and 1% by weight in a<br>
mixture of 90% by weight of ethanol and 10% by weight<br>
of water, acidified with 0.3N HC1.<br>
EXAMPLE 4:<br>
The four samples El, E2, E3 and E4 prepared according<br>
to examples 1 to 3 are evaluated according to the<br>
following criteria:<br>
1)	measurement of the initial contact angle of water,<br>
which gives a reference indication of the hydrophobic<br>
nature of the grafted substrate;<br>
2)	the abrasion resistance, obtained by measuring the<br>
residual contact angle of water on the sample after the<br>
grafted hydrophobic/oleophobic coating has undergone<br><br>
- 12 -<br>
abrasion according to two different tests:<br>
a)	the Opel® friction test, performed on the samples<br>
with a felt of hardness HI, a load of 0.4 kg/cm2 on a<br>
surface of 1.5 cm2, with a translation speed of<br>
b0 cycles/minute and a rotation speed of 6 rpm. A<br>
sample is judged to be satisfactory in the test if the<br>
contact angle remains greater than 80° after<br>
5000 cycles;<br>
b)	the Toyota® friction test, performed according to<br>
standard TSR7503G, with a load of 0.3 kg/cm2 on a<br>
surface of 4 cm2 with a translation speed of<br>
4 0 cycles/minute and using a device manufactured by the<br>
company Daiei Kagaku Seiki. A sample is judged to be<br>
satisfactory if the contact angle remains greater than<br>
80° after 1500 cycles;<br><br>
3)	the UV-A radiation resistance, measured via tests of<br>
continuous illumination of the samples with a xenon<br>
Lamp emitting UV radiation whose integrated lighting<br>
between 300 and 400 nm is 60 W/m2. A sample is judged<br>
to be satisfactory in the test if the contact angle<br>
remains greater than 80° after 2 000 hours of exposure;<br>
4)	the saline corrosion resistance, measured according<br>
to the Neutral Saline Fog (NSF) test as described<br>
according to standard NF ISO 9227. The test consists in<br>
spraying fine droplets of saline water (NaCl solution<br>
at 5 0 g/1, of pH = 7) at a temperature of 35°C. The<br>
samples are inclined at 20° relative to the vertical.<br>
The strictest standard currently in force for an<br>
application on motor vehicle side windows demands a<br>
contact angle of water of greater than 70° after<br>
3 00 test hours.<br>
The results obtained for the samples prepared in<br>
accordance with examples 1 to 3 are collated in<br>

Table 1<br>
Comparison of the data collated in table 1 shows that<br>
the presence of a priming sublayer in accordance with<br>
the invention leads to initial rain-repellency<br>
properties of the treated surface that are identical to<br>
those obtained with the priming of the prior art.<br>
Similarly, the abrasion- and UV-resistance properties<br>
arc substantially identical, as shown by the results<br>
obtained in the Opel® test, the Toyota® test and the<br>
UV test on the various samples.<br>
Samples El and E2 comprising the hydrophobic/oleophobic<br>
coating according to the invention show a saline<br>
corrosion resistance, measured via the NSF test, that<br>
is considerably better than that of the coatings known<br>
hi Lherto.<br>
EXAMPLES 5 TO 8:<br>
These examples show the influence of the nature of the<br>
alkyl chain R3 present between the two silicon atoms in<br>
the bis-silane used for the priming layer on the<br>
properties of the hydrophobic coating finally obtained.<br>
The experimental protocol is the same as that described<br>
in example 1, except that the precursor used to obtain<br>
the priming layer is replaced in the following manner.<br><br>

Table 2<br>
It is noted that the increase in the length of the<br>
alkyl chain R3 does not influence the saline corrosion<br>
resistance qualities. On the other hand, the abrasion<br>
resistance tests are less favorable when the linear<br>
carbon-based chain comprises 6 or more carbon atoms.<br><br>
