				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a tobacco based mouth freshener composition.<br>
More particularly, the present invention relates to a tobacco based mouth<br>
freshener composition having good effects of freshener products. More<br>
particularly, the present invention relates to mouth freshener composition<br>
prepared by using muretthi, kattha (cateche), supari, menthol, chunna,<br>
tobacco, natural perfume, glycerin and also eatable cardamom (elaichi) and<br>
mixture of clove powder and black cardamom powder, nutmeg powder, mace<br>
powder and cinnamon powder in particular ratio. Moreover this invention<br>
relates to the process of preparing the composition containing the above<br>
ingredients.<br>
Background of the invention and related prior Art<br>
One of the major problems involved in the use of full or partial dentures is the<br>
production of offensive denture breath, or "bad breath" due to food and<br>
beverage retained between the palate and denture, and the capturing of food in<br>
denture adhesive, used by some denture wearers.<br>
Up to the present no satisfactory compositions or methods have been obtained<br>
which will overcome this problem for long periods of time, and despite the<br>
2<br>
widespread use of varying dental flavoring materials there has been no<br>
effective longterm solution to overcome the problem of offensive denture<br>
breadth (bad breath) .<br>
There are so many companies who are also well recognized in the national and<br>
international markets as leading exporters, importers and suppliers of Chewing<br>
Tobacco, Guthka products and other Mouth Freshener. With the commonly<br>
appearing forms of tobacco being in forms of smoking, chewing, snuffing, or<br>
dipping tobacco, the Tobacco range offered by us is different options including<br>
as cigars, cigarettes, snuff, pipe and chewing tobacco. These non flavored and<br>
flavored tobacco products are refined grade Indian tobacco and represent the<br>
great Indian legacy of tobacco usage since long time. The products offered<br>
include: The habit of spitting out the chewed betel is also believed to aid the<br>
spread of diseases like tuberculosis.<br>
Recent internationalized diets and diversified life styles have been heightening<br>
the awareness of unpleasant breath and exhaled air. In addition, consumers'<br>
demands for fragrance products suitable for use in the human mouth cavity<br>
have also significantly changed. In particular, popular products are gums,<br>
candies and the like containing a freshening agent suitable for easy use in the<br>
mouth cavity to remove unpleasant odor generated by foul breath and exhaled<br>
3<br>
air after meals (e.g. "gyouza " (Chinese dumpling), "yakiniku" (Korean-style<br>
grilled meat), etc.) and alcoholic beverages, etc., which tend to leave bad food<br>
smells in the mouth when one is out visiting.<br>
In south-east Asia, Taiwan and Papua New Guinea, smoking, alcohol<br>
consumption and chewing of betel quid with or without tobacco or areca nut<br>
with or without tobacco are the predominant causes of oral cancer. In most<br>
areas, betel quid consists of a mixture of areca nut, slaked lime, catechu and<br>
several condiments according to taste, wrapped in a betel leaf. Almost all<br>
habitual chewers use tobacco with or without the betel quid. In the last few<br>
decades, small, attractive and inexpensive sachets of betel quid substitutes have<br>
become widely available. Aggressively advertised and marketed, often claimed<br>
to be safer products, they are consumed by the very young and old alike,<br>
particularly in India, but also among migrant populations from these areas<br>
world wide. The product is basically a flavoured and sweetened dry mixture of<br>
areca nut, catechu and slaked lime with tobacco (gutkha) or without tobacco<br>
(pan masala). These products have been strongly implicated in the recent<br>
increase in the incidence of oral submucous fibrosis, especially in the very<br>
young, even after a short period of use. This precancerous lesion, which has a<br>
high rate of malignant transformation, is extremely debilitating and has no<br>
known cure. The use of tobacco with lime, betel quid with tobacco, betel quid<br>
4<br>
without tobacco and areca nut have been classified as carcinogenic to humans.<br>
As gutkha and pan masala are mixtures of several of these ingredients, their<br>
carcinogenic affect can be surmised. We review evidence that strongly supports<br>
causative mechanisms for genotoxicity and carcinogenicity of these substitute<br>
products. Although some recent curbs have been put on the manufacture and<br>
sale of these products, urgent action IS needed to permanently<br>
ban gutkha and pan masala, together with the other established oral<br>
cancer-causing tobacco products. Further, education to reduce or eliminate<br>
home-made preparations needs to be accelerated.<br>
Pan masala is a mixture of nuts, seeds, herbs, and spices which is served after<br>
meals in India. Various versions are also served in the Middle East and parts of<br>
Southeast Asia, where they are treated as mouth fresheners. Some households<br>
and restaurants make their own mixtures with special house ingredients, and it<br>
is also possible to purchase packaged pan masala from spice stores and many<br>
markets in India. Outside of India, it is available at Indian specialty stores and<br>
through importers.<br>

• A large section of people mainly Coolies, migrant workers and youth are using<br>
the pan masala in the city. Another major fact to pinpoint here is the migration<br>
of workers from different states. Nowadays we can see all over the State so<br>
many migrant workers are seeking jobs. An alarming fact here is to note that<br>
one of the major pan masala sellers in the city is migrant workers. These<br>
dreadful intoxicants are really detrimental for human health. Chewing of pan<br>
masala and the use of tobacco products will cause cancer. Scientific facts report<br>
that those fond of chewing pan masala now have one more reason to evade this<br>
addictive habit. As it is a product of carcinogen it can cause infirmity in<br>
generations to come. In additional several studies shows that the severe<br>
consumption of this intoxicant can cause damage to genes, which can in turn be<br>
harmful to descendants.<br>
According to the document 2710IDEL/2012, a pan masala (betal quid) and a<br>
mouth freshener and the process of preparing thereof, comprising, betal nuts<br>
taken in the range of60% to 95% by weight of the composition and coated with<br>
with olive oil taken in the range of 0.1 to 1 and glycerine taken in the range of<br>
0.1% to 1% by weight of the composition, starch taken in the range of 2% to<br>
15% by weight of the composition, Katha taken in the range of 3% to 15% by<br>
weight of the composition, sorbitol taken in the range of 1% to 10% by weight<br>
of the composition, mannitol taken in the range of 1% to 10% by weight of the<br>
10<br>
• composition, microcrystalline cellulose taken in the range of 0.5% to 5% by<br>
weight of the composition, guar gum taken in the range of 0.5 to 5% by weight<br>
of the composition, maltodextrin taken in the range of 0.5% to 5% by weight<br>
of the composition, slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) taken in the range of 0.1<br>
to 1 % by weight, menthol taken in the range of 0.3 to 1% by weight of the<br>
composition, lendi pepper taken in the range of 0.1% to 2.0% and a herbal<br>
blend of oils along with permitted flavours and manually mixed.<br>
B. K. Sinha et al ( 1994, vol. 46, Springer) states that the effects of application<br>
of Pan Parag with tobacco on buccal mucosa of 21 albino rats (Wistar strain)<br>
were studied. The paste made up of pan Parag (instant betel nut preparation<br>
with tobacco) was painted over the entire buccal mocosa of the experimental<br>
group (n=21) on every alternate day from the 46th to 255th day of the study<br>
with a total of 42 days intervening rest period. Whereas in the control group<br>
(N=14), the painting brush dipped in tap water was rubbed over the buccal<br>
mucosa in the same frequency. Punch biopsies were taken from the buccal<br>
mucosa of all the animals on the 31 st day, 106th day, 181 st day and 256th day<br>
of the study. The animals were left untouched for 15 days following each<br>
biopsy procedure. The biopsy specimens in the experimental group after 2<br>
months painting revealed changes of Papillomatosis in 22% and dysplasia in<br>
39% of rats. Dysplastic changes were observed in 83% of the animals at the<br>
11<br>
-1<br>
• end of 4th months, which increased to 95% after 6 months. The control group<br>
revealed no significant pathological changes. Our study shows that the<br>
application of Instant betel nut preparation with tobacco (Pan Parag) causes<br>
significant histopathological changes in a short period of time and are<br>
responsible for the production of the various premalignant lesions affecting the<br>
oral cavity.<br>
Another document 87/MUM/2008 states a chewable mouth freshener<br>
containing boiled and roasted areca nuts (Supari), catechu (katha), lime,<br>
cardamom, along with a special agent, and optionally a number of fine natural<br>
flavouring materials. The resulting product has a good shelf life and poses<br>
reduced health risk to the consumer than similar products currently available in<br>
the market. The special agent is selected from a group comprising arrow root<br>
powder, psyllium husk, wheat bran, wheat fiber, what husk, wheat starch,<br>
wheat protein, rice bran, rice starch, rice protein, extruded rice powder,<br>
pregelatinised rice powder, maltodextrin, tapioca starch, tapioca dextrin, oat<br>
meal, oat bran, oat fiber, com fiber, com starch, apple fiber, potato powder,<br>
potato starch, lactose, milk solids, milk salts.<br>
If the number of consumers those who use this intoxicant in a hefty way the<br>
people in the city will affected with dreadful diseases. Strong curbs against the<br>
12<br>
~ usage of the tobacco usage should implement is an urgent need. Further, the<br>
education to reduce and eliminate the pan masala from the city needs to be<br>
accelerated.<br>
US3886265 discloses a mouth cleansing preparation containing at least one<br>
ene-diol compound having at most 6 carbon atoms and an oxidizing agent in<br>
the form of a water soluble peroxide. The composition is intended to eliminate<br>
bad breath and is employed in the form of a chewable tablet. The composition<br>
can contain flavoring agents, but these are not in the form of encapsulated<br>
droplets adapted for slow sustained release In the mouth.<br>
US4,029,759 discloses a method for imparting a cooling property to a<br>
composition for use in the oral cavity. Specifically, the patent discloses the use<br>
of para-menthane derivatives to various substances used in the mouth, such as<br>
toothpaste, mouthwash, tooth powder, food stuffs and the like. The paramenthane<br>
derivatives can also be employed in combination with flavoring<br>
materials. Lacking in this disclosure is any teaching concerning sustained slow<br>
release of flavoring material In the mouth.<br>
US4,071,614 discloses a dentifrice which contains encapsulated flavoring<br>
material. The dentifrice contains two different flavoring materials in which one<br>
13<br>
• flavor is encapsulated in a thin walled capsule and the other is encapsulated in a<br>
thick walled capsule. The thin walled capsules rupture when the toothpaste is<br>
squeezed from the container and the thick walled capsules rupture in the course<br>
of brushing the teeth. The encapsulated material is not watersoluble and is<br>
intended for being broken by a mechanical action to release bursts of the<br>
flavoring material. There is thus no disclosure in respect of a slow sustained<br>
release of flavoring material, particularly, in conjunction with a static situation,<br>
such as, installation of dentures.<br>
The other document W02009116060 refers to the invention which states that a<br>
chewable mouth freshener containing boiled and roasted areca nuts (Supari),<br>
catechu (katha), lime, cardamom, along with a special agent, and optionally a<br>
number of fine natural flavouring materials. The resulting product has a good<br>
shelf life and poses reduced health risk to the consumer than similar products<br>
currently available in the market. The special agent is selected from a group<br>
comprising arrow root powder, psyllium husk, wheat bran, wheat fiber, what<br>
husk, wheat starch, wheat protein, rice bran, rice starch, rice protein, extruded<br>
rice powder, pregelatinised rice powder, maltodextrin, tapioca starch, tapioca<br>
dextrin, oat meal, oat bran, oat fiber, com fiber, com starch, apple fiber, potato<br>
powder, potato starch, lactose, milk solids, milk salts.<br>

, Indeed, such problem makes difficult the patient's transition to the wearing of<br>
dentures. Flavorings, such as spray breath fresheners, mouth washes, chewing<br>
gums, lozenges, and denture cleaners as presently employed have only a<br>
limited life of very short duration and rapidly lose their ability to mask bad<br>
breath.<br>

The above results clearly and surprisingly show that the Example I II<br>
combination of the invention, namely, the all ingredients combination is far<br>
and away superior to combinations of as well as each of the above substrates<br>
or adsorbents employed in example I and II in reducing and eliminating onion<br>
odor. Accordingly, it is clear that the combination of the invention is indeed a<br>
synergistic combination in that the combination is far superior in performance<br>
to the additive performance of that of example I and II. In fact, the above<br>
results are indeed totally unexpected in that one skilled in the art would expect<br>
that the higher specific volume material (indicative of a high surface area)<br>
should adsorb odor more effectively which has the lowest specific volume<br>
(lowest surface area) of all the substrate materials tested. The fact that the<br>
results are' opposite to that which would be nonnally expected is indeed<br>
surprising and unexpected.<br>
An object of the invention is to provide a breath and mouth freshener<br>
composition and mouth coolant, having a slow release in the mouth, capable of<br>
eliminating offensive breath, and cooling the mouth.<br>
20<br>
• The invention also meets the oral gratification needs of the consumer by<br>
offering the additional benefits of a refreshing taste and feel in the mouth and<br>
the feeling of the user being that ofjust having brushed the teeth.<br>
Paan Masala Compounds that are a perfect mode of relaxation and enhances the<br>
mood of the consumers with quality tobacco ingredients in it. Manufactured<br>
under the supervision of experts, these are widely appreciated and tasted<br>
worldwide. These are blended with ingredients that enhance the flavor and taste<br>
ofpan masala. Our range ofpaan masala compound is enriched with cardamom<br>
(elaichi) and other such things that adds to its fragrance. The Supari is made<br>
from pure and natural ingredients are mixed. These are widely appreciated for<br>
fresh aroma and refreshing taste. This has been prepared in an automated<br>
electronic plant and premium quality raw material and offers our range In<br>
suitable and hygienic packaging preserving the freshness and rich taste.<br>
In fact, it has been found that the basic material each by itself is not very<br>
effective in reducing or eliminating onion odor but a combination of all the<br>
above ingredients are surprisingly effective for such purpose. Such<br>
combinations are substantially more effective in eliminating onion odor than<br>
the additive effect of either component of each combination alone thereby<br>
indicating that such combinations are synergistic combinations.<br>

The present invention is much less expenSIve to produce than a bottle or<br>
aerosol dispenser. The present invention can be offered in a restaurant after a<br>
meal because of its inexpensive cost and sanitary manner. It is not necessary<br>
to keep it in your mouth like a breath mint.<br>
For a panmashala composition to be added to an mouth freshner, on the other<br>
hand, it is important as basic requirements to mask an smell derived from a<br>
cosmetic base and to have good long-term storage stability. Further, from the<br>
viewpoint of its comfortable use by consumers and the enhancement of its<br>
attraction as merchandise, it is also important that this composition has a good<br>
scent at each ofthe following three stages:<br>
The breath freshener sample was tasted. It melted smoothly in the mouth and a<br>
desirable apple flavored cool freshness spread throughout the entire oral cavity<br>
when the capsule coating membrane (soft membrane material) ruptured in the<br>
mouth. Unpleasant odor in the mouth was also removed, and exhaled air after a<br>
meal had a desirable fragrance.<br>
22<br>
•<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY:<br>
The a tobacco based mouth freshener composition of the present invention can<br>
remove unpleasant odor generated from foul breath and exhaled air, easily not<br>
only after eating and/or drinking but also when leaving home or at a place away<br>
from home. Furthermore, since the breath freshener of the invention contains a<br>
hydrophilic sweetener, the freshener skillfully masks and mitigates bitter taste<br>
derived from freshening agents or flavors and also succeeds in imparting a<br>
variety of tastes including sweet taste, thus being fully responsive to changes in<br>
consumer tastes and being highly useful.<br>
Although the invention has been described in conjunction with a specific<br>
embodiment thereof it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that numerous<br>
modifications and variations can be undertaken without departing from the<br>
scope and spirit of the invention as defined in the attached claims.<br>
