				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to the process of making a class of high alumina refractory castables in<br>
which spinel is formed insitu during service at high temperature. The invention is in particular related<br>
to development of a new class of refractory products with very good corrosion resistance to steel<br>
making slag and thermal shock resistance in addition to other superior physical and thermo-<br>
mechanical properties. The invented class of materials are to substitute spinel added high alumina<br>
castables for use in working lining, well Block, nozzle, purging plug of Ladle Furnaces and other critical<br>
areas of steel making processes in a cost effective manner.<br>
Spinel structure is such that within its unit cell considerable octahedral and tetrahedra! rites remain<br>
vacant. Therefore it can form a solid solution with varying amount of Al203, MgO and other oxides.<br>
Due to this characteristic, spinel can be made to have either excess MgO or Al203 in the form of solid<br>
solution. Also spinel traps the rapidly diffusing species such as oxides of iron and manganese from the<br>
slag within its crystal structure forming complex spinel, i.e. (Mg,Mn,Fe)o.(Fe,AI)2O3. Further the lime<br>
of slag reacts with alumina of alumina- rich spinel forming highly refractory Ca0.6AI2O3. Depletion of<br>
MnO, FeO and CaO makes the slag richer in silica and hence more viscous. This increase in viscosity of<br>
slag reduces its ability to penetrate inside the castable lining. As a result slag corrosion resistance of<br>
high alumina castable containing spinel rich in alumina is improved, which is one of the main criteria<br>
of steel ladle refractories. Another contribution of spinel addition in high alumina castable is in the<br>
improvement of thermal shock resistance of the later owing to its lower thermal expansion co-efficient<br>
and modulus of elasticity.<br>
In conventional spinel based high alumina castables preformed spinel is added to achieve the above<br>
advantages of spinel in order to improve performance of the high alumina refractory lining. However,<br>
the above characteristics of spinel can be further improved if the spinel is formed in situ in the<br>
refractory during service. The insitu formed spinel is very fine and is more effective in trapping FeO<br>
and MnO of slag and thereby further improves corrosion resistance of high alumina castables.<br>
The objective of the present invention was to develop a process for making alumina-magnesia based<br>
high alumina castables wherein spinel is formed in situ during service at high temperature. This has<br>
been achieved by incorporating magnesia in the matrix of the castable instead of adding preformed<br>
spinel. The added magnesia reacts with the alumina present in the castable matrix at high<br>
temperature during service and fcrms insitu-spinel.<br>
From laboratory study it was established that presence of silica in the matrix of castable<br>
accelerates insitu spinel formation at the service temperature. Sillica forms liquid phase<br>
in combination with Al203, CaO (from added cement) and MgO present in the castable<br>
matrix at high temperature and, this liquid phase facilitates in accelerating insitu spinel<br>
formation. Therefore silica has been incorporated in the castable matrix to maximise<br>
spinel formation within a short period at high temperature. But since too much of liquid<br>
formation at high temperature deteriorates the refractoriness under load (RUL) of a<br>
refractory, so silica addition was carefully controlled along with the cement content of<br>
the castable. Further presence of magnesia fines in high alumina castables impairs its<br>
rhelogical characteristics (i.e., consistency upon mixing with water, subsequent<br>
working duration of the mix and flow under vibration during placement), which were<br>
taken care by optimising the amount of fines in added magnesia and incorporating an<br>
additive.<br>
This invention involved development of a process for making tailor made insitu spinel<br>
forming high alumina castable compositions. The invented castable compositions were<br>
arrived at after extensive laboratory work and trials on different formulations and,<br>
subsequent optimisation with respect to properties and batch compositions. The<br>
laboratory work and trials carried out comprised of following studies on high alumina<br>
castables: Study on the matrix of such castables to find the effect of different ingredients<br>
and temperature on spinel formation and alumina content of spinel formed. Rheological<br>
behaviour of such high alumina castables in presence of magnesia fine particles, green<br>
and fired strength, permanent linear change (PLC) after heating to high temperature,<br>
apparent porosity after firing, refractoriness under load (RUL (a). 2 kg/cm" ). spinel<br>
formation and alumina content of the spinel formed by XRD analysis, thermal shock<br>
resistance by water quenching from 1200°C and slag resistance by Induction Furnace<br>
Slag Corrosion Test at 1650-1700°C for 5 hours using synthetic slag.<br>
The invented castable compositions comprised of sintered/fused alumina grains, calcined<br>
and sintered alumina fines, sea water magnesia, micro fine silica, high alumina cement<br>
and additives to achieve the desired properties.<br>
Chemical Composition<br>
The chemical composition of the total mix can be varied to achieve specific end<br>
properties depending upon area/condition of applications. The broad range is given in<br>
Annexure I. During manufacturing stage or during subsequent storage no chemical<br>
reaction takes place between various ingredients of the compositions. Whatever<br>
reactions/changes do occur, those are during application and service at high temperature<br>
only.<br>
Results of Trials Conducted<br>
Extensive Laboratory work/trials have been conducted during development stage of the<br>
process for the invented castables and, the final outcome of Laboratory scale trials are<br>
summarised in Annexure-I. These, arc the properties achieved for this invented<br>
castables as obtained on samples made after mixing with specified amount ot water<br>
following standard procedures of sample making by vibro-casting and after drying and firing<br>
at different temperatures.<br>
Properties of conventional high Alumina spinel added castables as reported in literature are<br>
given in Annexure-II.<br>
Process of Manufacturing:<br>
According an aspect of the present invention, fine powder ingredients are first added in a<br>
specific sequence and intimately mixed in suitable mixer. Coarse ingredients are then added<br>
in the mixer and the whole mass is mixed thoroughly. After mixing is over the castable thus<br>
obtained is inspected, packed in waterproof bags and stored in a dry place.<br>
According to a preferred aspect of the present invention directed to a process for making<br>
insitu spinel forming high alumina castables, comprising:<br>
a. Adding fine powder ingredients in the following order and in the indicated proportion:<br>
i) Sea Water Magnesia-Fused or sintered (5-7 part by weight);<br>
ii) Calcined Micro fine Alumina (11-13 part by weight);<br>
iii) Calcined Super fine Alumina (3-4 part by weight);<br>
iv) Sintered Alumina fines (6-7 part by weight);<br>
b. Mixing the same thoroughly and mixing is continued while adding the following one<br>
by one in the given order and in the indicated proportion:<br>
i) Micro silica (0-1 part by weight);<br>
ii) Sodium hexa meta phosphate (0.1-0.2 part by weight);<br>
iii) Citric acid (0.02-0.05 part by weight);<br>
iv) White fused Alumina fines (8-12 part by weight) and Alumina grains(56-62 part by<br>
weight);<br>
v) High Alumina Cement(2-3 part by weight);<br>
c. preparing a thorough blend to obtain a final storable insitu spinel forming high<br>
alumina castable product.<br>
A further aspect of the process for making in situ spinel formed high Alumina coated<br>
surfaces comprising mixing the in-situ spinel with 5.5-6% water, involving vibro-casting<br>
followed by curing, air drying, drying and preheating (up to at least 1000°C) as per<br>
schedules normally followed for low moisture castables and thereafter the lining or the<br>
prefabricated shape made out of this castable is ready for actual service where service<br>
temperature is about 1700°C.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, unlike the conventional process using<br>
pre-formed spinel added while making the high alumina castables, the invented castables of<br>
the present process do not use any pre-formed spinel and instead magnesia is added which<br>
reacts at high temperature during service with the fine alumina present and forms insitu<br>
spinel. This insitu formed spinel is more effective than pre-formed spinel in improving<br>
resistance of the castable lining from slag attack. Further as preformed spinel is a very high<br>
cost raw material as compared to magnesia and alumina, so cost of the invented castable is<br>
substantially less than that of pre-formed spinel added castables.<br>
Batch composition of invented castables, details of different components and manufacturing<br>
process flow chart are given in Annexure -III, IV and V.<br>
Potential areas of application:<br>
-Working lining of steel ladle in bottom and metal zones;<br>
-Teeming well block of Steel ladles;<br>
-Porous plug and its seating block for steel ladles;<br>
