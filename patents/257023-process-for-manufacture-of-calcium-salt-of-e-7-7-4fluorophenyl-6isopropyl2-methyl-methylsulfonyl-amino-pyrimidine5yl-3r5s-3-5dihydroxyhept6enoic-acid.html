				<td>PROCESS FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF THE CALCIUM SALT OF ROSTJVASTATIN (E)-7-'4-(4-FLUOROPHENYL) -6-ISOPROPYL-2- x METHYL (METHYLSULFONYL) AMINO ! PYRMIDIN -5-YL ! (3R, 5S) -3,5-DIHYDR0XYHEPT-6-EN0IC ACID AND CRYSTALLINE INTERMEDIATES THEREOF<br>
This invention concerns improvements to a chemical process, particularly a chemical process for manufacture of (E)-7-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-6-isopropyl-2-[methyl(methylsulfonyl)armino]pyrmidin-5-yl](3RJ5S)-3,5-dihydroxyhept-6-enoic acid calcium salt (1) (illustrated below), which is useful for the production of a pharmaceutical useful in the treatment of, inter alia, hypercholesterolemia, hyperlipoproteinemia and atherosclerosis. This invention also concerns crystalline intermediates useful in the chemical process.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The sodium salt (3) and calcium salt (1) of the compound (E)-7-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-6-isopropyl-2-[methyl(meTHylsulfonyl)amino]pyrimidin-5-yl](3R,5S)-3,5-dihydroxyhept--6-enoic acid (hereinafter referred to as the 'Agent') were disclosed in European Patent 0521471. This patent also describes a process for the synthesis of the calcium salt (1), via the dihydroxy ester (2) and the sodium salt (3), as shown in Scheme 1 below. The calcium salt thus formed is then collected and dried and may be processed further as required.<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br><br>
Scheme 1<br>
Our International Patent Application WO 00/49014 describes an alternative route to the calcium salt (1), also via the sodium salt (3), from the compound tert-butyl (E)-(6-{2-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-6-isopropyl-2-[methyl(methylsulfonyl)amino]pyrimidin-5-yl]vinyl}(4R,6S)-2,2-dimethyl[l,3]dioxan-4-yl)acetate (BEM) (4), which is exemplified as shown in Scheme 2 below:<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br><br>
Scheme 2<br>
As described in WO 00/49014, the transformation from BEM (4) to the calcium salt (1) may be carried out via the methylamine salt (5) as shown in Scheme 2. Isolation of this intermediate crystalline methylamine salt allows purification by recrystallisation before final formation of the (amorphous) calcium salt. However formation of the methylamine salt introduces an extra step into the process, which is generally undesirable for manufacture (for example because of additional cost and the potential for introduction of additional impurities).<br>
The transformation from BEM (4) to the sodium salt (3) in Scheme 2 takes place in two steps as shown below in Scheme 3.<br><br>
(Scheme Removed)<br><br>
Scheme 3<br>
Treatment with hydrochloric acid hydrolyses the acetal to the diol (6) (referred to herein as BED), then treatment with sodium hydroxide hydrolyses the ester to give the sodium salt (3) of the parent carboxylic acid. The intermediate compound BED (6) is not isolated in the process described in WO 00/49014. The analogous methyl ester (2) was described in European Patent 0521471 as a syrup and therefore, by analogy, isolation of BED (6) would not be expected to provide any advantages to the process.<br>
However we have surprisingly found that BED and other (l-6C)alkyl ester analogues are generally crystalline compounds which may advantageously be isolated and recrystallised, thus removing the need for isolation of an intermediate salt such as the methylamine salt in order for purification to be carried out.<br>
Therefore the present invention provides a process for the manufacture of the calcium salt of (E)-7-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-6-isopropyl-2-[methyl(methylsulfonyl)amino]pyrimidin-5-yl](3R,5S)-3,5-dihydroxyhept-6-enoic acid, comprising: a) acid hydrolysis of an acetal protecting group in a compound of the formula (7)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
wherein A is an acetal or ketal protecting group and R is (l-6C)alkyl, and isolation of the resulting crystalline compound of the formula (8); <br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
b)	optional recrystallisation of the compound of the formula (8);<br>
c)	hydrolysis of the ester group in the compound (8) to give a dihydroxy carboxylate derivative (9) (wherein M is hydrogen or a metal counterion other than calcium) or a compound of the formula (1); and<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
d) where necessary, conversion of a compound of the formula (9) into a compound of the formula (1).<br>
In a further aspect of the invention there is provided crystalline compounds of the formula (8).<br>
Furthermore, we have found that some compounds of the formula (7), which are analogues of BEM (4) are also crystalline and are themselves useful intermediates which may<br><br>
be recrystallised if necessary to improve the quality of the material. These crystalline compounds are novel and each independently provides a further aspect of the invention.<br>

A crystalline polymorph of BEM (4) is provided as a further aspect of the invention. The X-ray powder diffraction spectra were determined by mounting a sample of the crystalline form on Siemans single silicon crystal (SSC) wafer mounts and spreading out the sample into a thin layer with the aid of a microscope slide. The sample was spun at 30 revolutions per minute (to improve counting statistics) and irradiated with X-rays generated by a copper long-fine focus tube operated at 40kV and 40mA with a wavelength of 1.5406 angstroms. The collimated x-ray source was passed through an automatic variable divergence slit set at V20 (20mm path length) and the reflected radiation directed through a 2mm antiscatter slit and a 0.2mm detector slit. The sample was exposed for 4 seconds per 0.02 degree 2-theta increment (continuous scan mode) over the range 2 degrees to 40 degrees 2-theta in theta-theta mode.    The running time was 2 hours 6 minutes and 40 seconds. The instrument was equipped with a scintillation counter as detector. Control and data capture was by means of a DECpc LPv 433sx personal computer running with Diffrac AT (Socabim) software.<br><br>
It will be understood that the 2-theta values of an X-ray powder diffraction pattern may vary slightly from one machine to another or from one sample to another, and so the values quoted are not to be construed as absolute. It will also be understood that the relative intensities of peaks may vary according to the orientation of the sample under test so that the intensities in the XRD traces included herein are illustrative and not intended to be used for absolute comparison.<br>
The crystalline forms obtained according to the present invention are substantially free from other crystal and non-crystal forms of each compound of the formula 7 or 8. The term "substantially free from other crystal and non-crystal forms" shall be understood to mean that the desired crystal form contains less than 50%, preferably less than 10%, more preferably less than 5% of any other form of the compound.<br>

It will be appreciated that the process described in WO 00/49014 for isolation of the amorphous calcium salt of the Agent, or the process described in WO2004/014872, for precipitation of the amorphous form of the calcium salt of the Agent from a (substantially) aqueous solution of a different salt form, will generally lead to a proportion of residual calcium salt of the Agent in waste solutions such as the mother liquors remaining after the precipitated salt has been filtered off. Even a very small proportion of such residue may represent significant financial loss if the process is carried out repeatedly on a commercial manufacturing scale. Any reduction in such residue also potentially provides environmental benefits, reducing the amount of treatment that effluent requires before it can be disposed of.<br>
We have found that this loss may be avoided by treatment of said waste solutions (such as mother liquors) such that the residue calcium salt of the Agent may be isolated as crystalline lactone, optionally re-crystallised and then re-treated to form the desired calcium salt of the Agent. Thus lactone has value as a processing aid for isolation of the amorphous form of the Agent.<br>

The contents of the vessel were kept at -65°C for 15 minutes, then allowed to warm evenly to 10°C over 80 minutes. Water (40.4 mL) followed by acetic acid (6.87 g, 114 mmol) were added to give a two phase light yellow solution. The batch was then distilled at atmospheric pressure to remove - 485 mL of distillates. This solution was washed sequentially with water (84 mL), 7.0% w/w sodium bicarbonate (92.6 g), 1.8% w/w sodium bicarbonate (91.1 g) and water (63.5 mL). The resulting organic phase was distilled under vacuum at 270 mbar to leave ~ 95 mL of solution in the distillation flask (removing ~ 229mL of distillates). Methanol (202 mL) at 50°C was charged to the flask and the solution distilled at atmospheric pressure, removing ~ 134 mL of distillates. A further portion of methanol (229 mL) at 50°C was added to the solution and the batch cooled to 40°C over 30 minutes. The batch was cooled to 25°C over 30 minutes, 0-5°C over 30 minutes, then chilled to -8°C over 20 minutes and kept at this temperature for 30 minutes.

Dimethyl sulphide (11.67 mL, 121 mmol) was then added dropwise to the cooled solution over 30 minutes, keeping the contents at -60°C. After 30 minutes at this temperature, isopropyl 2-[(4R,6S)-6-formyl-2,2-dimethyl-l,3-dioxan-4-yl}acetate (24.56 g, 95 mmol) in toluene (46.7 mL) was added dropwise to the vessel over 30 minutes, maintaining the internal temperature at -60°C. The reaction mixture was agitated at -60°C for 30 minutes followed by the dropwise addition of triethylamine (26.36 g, 261 mmol) over 30 minutes, allowing the internal temperature to rise to -50°C. The reaction mixture was then allowed to warm to 25°C evenly over 75 minutes. The resulting slurry was stirred at 25°C for 30 minutes, then water (77 mL) was added and the mixture agitated for 30 minutes. The aqueous layer was separated and the pH checked (pH should be between 7.5 and 8.5). The resulting organic portion was washed with water (23.3 mL) and the organic portion separated for vacuum distillation at 150 mbar. Distillation was continued until ~350 mL of toluene had been removed. Toluene (350 mL) was added to the flask and the vacuum distillation repeated at 150 mbar to remove -350 mL of toluene. The resulting solution was transferred to a flask containing activated 4 angstrom molecular sieves and left at ambient temperature overnight. This solution was used directly for the coupling stage.<br>
