				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a production method of an organic acid<br>
such as acrylic acid while utilizing reaction heat generated in a gas-phase<br>
catalytic oxidation reaction effectively. Particularly, the invention relates to a<br>
production method of the organic acid with high heat efficiency and high<br>
production efficiency by effective utilization of steam which is produced by a<br>
large quantity of heat generated in the gas-phase catalytic oxidation reaction<br>
and heat generated in combustion of a by-product of waste gas and waste oil<br>
from the production of the organic acid.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
The inventor of the present invention has been producing organic acids<br>
(for example, acrylic acid) by a gas-phase catalytic oxidation reaction. Since a<br>
large quantity of waste heat is generated in a large scale chemical plant as well<br>
as in a chemical plant for carrying out a gas-phase catalytic oxidation reaction,<br>
efforts have been made to use the waste heat as efficiently as possible by<br>
introducing heat utilization techniques.<br>
For example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (JP-A) H7-65818<br>
discloses a technique concerning to a method for recovering waste heat from<br>
cooling water in a fuel cell equipment. According to this technique, steam is<br>
obtained from cooling water used for heat removal at the time of a fuel cell<br>
generating power, and then the steam is supplied to a waste gas turbine power<br>
generator, and at the same time the steam is supplied to an absorption type<br>
refrigerator to obtain cold water. JP-A-2002-266656 discloses a technique<br>
concerning to a gas turbine cogeneration system. According to this technique,<br>
warm water produced by using waste gas passed through a waste heat<br>
recovery boiler is utilized to a driving heat source for an adsorption type<br><br>
refrigerator. In the technique of JP-A-2002-266656, cold water is used for<br>
cooling air sucked into the turbine.<br>
Waste heat is also utilized in an organic compound production plant.<br>
JP-A-S57-93946 discloses a technique of driving an absorption type<br>
refrigerator or the like by using a heat source of 90°C or less, which obtained in<br>
an ammoxidation process at the temperature of about from 100°C to 130°C, as<br>
a driving source. JP-A-H5-17377 discloses a technique of utilizing heat on<br>
production of styrene.<br>
Further, waste heat utilization in a waste incinerator, although not in a<br>
chemical plant, has been discussed. JP-A-H11-83232 discloses a technique of<br>
producing steam by a boiler using combustion gas generated in a waste<br>
incinerator, driving a turbine of a power generator by the steam to generate<br>
electric power, at the same time using a part of low temperature steam<br>
exhausted from the turbine as a driving heat source for a lithium bromide<br>
absorption type refrigerator, and using a part of high temperature steam at the<br>
inlet of the turbine as a driving heat source for an ammonia absorption type<br>
refrigerator.<br>
However, the techniques described in the above-mentioned<br>
JP-A-H7-65818, JP-A-2002-266656, JP-A-S57-93946, JP-A-H5-17377, and<br>
JP-A-Hll-83232 are not methods for utilizing waste heat in an organic acid<br>
production by a gas-phase catalytic oxidation reaction. Thus, it cannot say<br>
that it is appropriate to apply these techniques to an organic acid production<br>
plant as they are.<br>
In the case of carrying out a gas-phase catalytic oxidation reaction, it is<br>
required to supply a raw material in gas phase. For example, propylene<br>
liquid as a raw material is gasified through an evaporator and supplied to a<br>
reactor in the case of acrylic acid production. When a raw material such as<br>
propylene or the like is subjected to a gas-phase catalytic oxidation with<br>
molecular oxygen-containing gas in the presence of a gas-phase catalytic<br>
oxidation reaction catalyst, produced gas containing an aimed organic acid and<br><br>
by-products as well is obtained and at the same time a large quantity of<br>
reaction heat is generated. Generally, the reaction heat is recovered by heat<br>
exchange.<br>
In the successive step, the gas produced by the gas-phase catalytic<br>
oxidation is led to an absorbing column of an organic acid and contacted with a<br>
solvent (generally water is used) for collecting the organic acid to be cooled,<br>
absorbed, and collected. The obtained solution containing the organic acid<br>
and by-products is successively refined by a method such as distillation and<br>
crystallization to obtain the refined organic acid.<br>
With respect to utilization of reaction heat generated in an organic acid<br>
production by such gas-phase catalytic oxidation reaction, the inventor has<br>
already been examining. For example, the inventor applied an invention for a<br>
patent of JP-A-2003-73327 which discloses a method of recovering heat<br>
(including reaction heat) generated in an acrylic acid production plant as<br>
steam and using the heat as heat energy, mechanical energy, or electric energy.<br>
The inventor also applied an invention for a patent of JP-A-2003-268011 which<br>
discloses a method of using steam or cold liquid, which is generated in a<br>
production process of acrylic acid, in a poly(acrylic acid) production plant.<br>
Recently, collecting efficiency in an absorbing column of an organic acid<br>
has been improved to obtain high concentration acrylic acid aqueous solution.<br>
Conventionally, as a post-process of collecting acrylic acid, refining has been<br>
carried out by steps which are combined of dehydration distillation, distillation<br>
for removing high boiling point impurities, acrylic acid recovery distillation,<br>
aldehyde-removal distillation and the like, and low pressure steam recovered<br>
in a reaction step and the like has been utilized for the distillation steps.<br>
However, when the high concentration acrylic acid aqueous solution comes to<br>
be obtained, the number of the succeeding distillation steps and time taken for<br>
the steps can be saved, and used amount of the steam recovered in an acrylic<br>
acid production plant tends to be decreased accordingly.<br>
In an organic acid ester production step or in a crystallization step<br><br>
which is involved in the refining steps, a large quantity of cold water (brine) is<br>
required. To produce the cold water, a refrigerator has been driven by using<br>
commercial electric power or by generating electric power by rotating a turbine<br>
of a power generator by steam. However, in the first case, cost becomes high,<br>
and in the other case, electric power generation efficiency cannot be high. The<br>
above-mentioned JP-A-2003-268011 implies use of an absorption type<br>
refrigerator, however, it is not mentioned how to use the refrigerator.<br>
Accordingly, the purpose of the invention is to find a more specific and<br>
practical method of an effective utilization of reaction heat than methods<br>
disclosed in JP-A-2003-73327 and JP-A-2003-268011, and to provide a<br>
production method of an organic acid that is favorable to global environmental<br>
preservation and saving production cost.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The production method of an organic acid of the present invention<br>
includes a step of a gas-phase catalytic oxidation reaction of raw material gas<br>
carried out at the temperature from 250°C to 450°C. If the temperature is<br>
within a range from 250°C to 450°C, heat can be utilized efficiently. The raw<br>
material gas to be subjected to the gas-phase catalytic oxidation may be<br>
propane, propylene (meth)acrolein, isobutylene, xylene, naphthalene, benzene,<br>
butane, or the like. They may be subjected to the gas-phase catalytic<br>
oxidation with molecular oxygen-containing gas to produce (meth)acrylic acid,<br>
phthalic acid, maleic acid or the like.<br>
Hereinafter, the production method of an organic acid of the present<br>
invention will be described along with a production method of acrylic acid<br>
using propane and/or propylene (hereinafter, represented by "propylene") as a<br>
raw material. However, it is not intended that the invention will be limited to<br>
the following production method, and the invention may be applied to the<br>
gas-phase catalytic oxidation reaction of the above-mentioned raw material<br>
gases. Further, the following production method may be modified<br>
appropriately unless the effect of the invention is impaired. Accordingly, it is<br>
not intended that steam generated in the production process of the organic acid<br>
be limited to the following kinds, and the invention may be applied preferably<br>
to use of steam other than the exemplified kinds.<br><br>
In the production method of acrylic acid using propane and/or<br>
propylene as a raw material, the gas-phase catalytic oxidation reaction of<br>
propylene with molecular oxygen is carried out. The concentration of the raw<br>
material gas, the concentration of propylene, is preferably 7% to 15% by<br>
volume, and the water concentration is preferably adjusted to be in a range<br>
from 0% to 10% by volume. The molecular oxygen is preferably adjusted to<br>
satisfy a propylene/molecular oxygen ratio by volume in a range from 1/1.0 to<br>
1/2.0. The molecular oxygen to be used may include, for example, air,<br>
oxygen-enriched air, and pure oxygen. A gas phase catalytic oxidation reactor<br>
is not particularly limited, however, a multi-tubular reactor which is excellent<br>
in heat exchange efficiency is recommended.<br>
The operation conditions of the reactor are not particularly limited.<br>
For example, in the case of carrying out a two-stage gas-phase catalytic<br>
oxidation reaction in the reactor, acrolein-containing gas is produced from<br>
supplied gasified propylene in a first stage catalyst layer of the reactor.<br>
Temperature of the reaction is controlled in a range from 250°C to 450°C, and<br>
for example, it is recommended to control a pressure of the reaction in a range<br>
from 0 MPaG to 0.5 MPaG, and a space velocity in a range from 300 h-1 to 5000<br>
h-1 (STP) in respect of improving reaction efficiency. The acrolein-containing<br>
gas produced in the first stage catalyst layer is then introduced into a second<br>
stage catalyst layer of the reactor to produce acrylic acid-containing gas.<br>
Temperature of the reaction in the second stage catalyst layer is controlled in a<br>
range of preferably 250°C or more and 380°C or less, and more preferably<br>
300°C or less. A pressure of the reaction is preferably controlled in a range<br>
from 0 MPaG to 0.5 MPaG, and a space velocity is preferably controlled in a<br>
range from 300 h-1 to 5000 h-1 (STP). A catalyst packed in the reactor may be<br>
an oxidation catalyst commonly used in the production of acrylic acid for both<br>
of the first stage and the second stage. The production method of the acrylic<br>
acid-containing gas is not limited to the two-stage gas-phase catalytic<br>
oxidation reaction and may be adopted conventionally known acrylic<br><br>
acid-containing gas production methods of one-stage or a plurality of stages.<br>
As described above, when gasified propylene is subjected to gas-phase<br>
catalytic oxidation, reaction heat is generated since the reaction is an<br>
exothermal reaction. Therefore, a heat medium of predetermined reaction<br>
temperature (for example, 250°C or more and 450°C or less) is supplied to a<br>
shell side of the first stage reactor and the second stage reactor to remove the<br>
reaction heat from the tubes. A part of the heat medium heated by absorption<br>
of the reaction heat is discharged out and supplied to a steam generation<br>
apparatus (a heat medium boiler) to generate steam. The heat medium which<br>
is cooled by transferring heat to water may be circulated again to the shell<br>
sides of the reactor. In a similar way, in the second stage reactor, the heat<br>
medium is circulated and supplied to the steam generation apparatus. An<br>
inorganic type molten salt such as a mixture of potassium nitrate and sodium<br>
nitrite; and a mixture of potassium nitrate, sodium nitrite and sodium nitrate<br>
(HTS: so-called "niter"; for example, NeoSK-SOLT manufactured by Soken<br>
Tecnix Co., Ltd.); and an organic type heat medium such as Dowtherm<br>
(manufactured by Dow Chemical Company) may be used as the heat medium.<br>
It is preferable that the steam generation apparatus is installed in<br>
common to the first stage reactor and the second stage reactor to generate high<br>
pressure steam in respect of effective utilization of the heat, however, low<br>
pressure steam may be generated from the beginning. Further, the steam<br>
generation apparatus may be installed independently in each of the first stage<br>
reactor and the second stage reactor. For example, high pressure steam may<br>
be generated in the first stage rector and low pressure steam may be generated<br>
in the second stage reactor. Herein, high pressure steam means steam at a<br>
pressure of 1 MPaG or higher and low pressure steam means steam at a<br>
pressure lower than 1 MPaG.<br>
The steam generation apparatus used in the invention is not<br>
particularly limited and conventionally known heat medium boilers such as,<br>
for example, a cylindrical boiler, a natural circulation water tube boiler, a<br><br>
forced circulation boiler, a once-through boiler and the like may be used.<br>
The steam pressure in the steam generation apparatus may be selected<br>
without any limitation in a range higher than a steam pressure equivalent to a<br>
solidification point of the heat medium and lower than a steam pressure<br>
equivalent to the temperature of the heat medium. However, the steam<br>
pressure is preferably 1 MPaG or higher and more preferably 1.5 MPaG or<br>
higher, because high pressure steam is more efficient in use of the generated<br>
steam. Although the upper limit of the steam pressure is not particularly<br>
limited, the steam pressure is preferably 4.8 MPaG or lower and more<br>
preferably 4.5 MPaG or lower. When the steam pressure is too low, the<br>
temperature of the steam closes to the solidification point of the heat medium.<br>
Accordingly, in this case, the heat medium is easily to be solidified and the<br>
viscosity of the heat medium is also increased, and then heat transfer<br>
efficiency may be decreased. As a result, the apparatus has to be enlarged in<br>
order to recover heat efficiently. On the other hand, when the steam pressure<br>
is too high, the designed pressure is increased to result in higher cost of the<br>
apparatus. Further, in the case of high pressure, the temperature difference<br>
between the steam and the heat medium is small, and therefore, the heat<br>
transfer area of the apparatus becomes large.<br>
The means of pressure control in the steam generation apparatus<br>
should not be particularly limited and, for example, a valve (a control valve)<br>
may be exemplified. The pressure in the steam generation apparatus can be<br>
measured by properly installing a pressure gauge, a pressure sensor or the like<br>
such as, for example, a Bourdon-tube type, a diaphragm type or the like at a<br>
proper point. The temperature in the steam generation apparatus can be<br>
measured by properly installing a thermoelectric thermometer, a resistance<br>
thermometer, an expansion thermometer or the like in a proper point of pipes<br>
or appliances. In addition, a control part may be combined to be capable of<br>
controlling the pressure automatically by using a detection part such as the<br>
above-mentioned pressure gauge, thermometer and the like and an operation<br><br>
part such as the pressure control valve and the like.<br>
In the case that the reaction heat is recovered as high pressure steam<br>
(the temperature is not particularly limited, however, generally a range from<br>
183°C to 270°C) at a pressure of 1 MPaG or higher (more preferably 1.5 MPaG<br>
or higher), all or a part of the high pressure steam is superheated to the<br>
temperature of over 183°C to 450°C by heat exchange with the heat medium of<br>
high temperature, if necessary, and supplied to a back pressure steam turbine<br>
connected with a blower for supplying molecular oxygen to the reactor. The<br>
high pressure steam rotates the turbine, so that a blower fan also rotates to be<br>
capable of supplying the molecular oxygen to the reactor. In addition, in the<br>
case that excess motive power remains after the high pressure steam is<br>
supplied to the back pressure steam turbine to obtain blower driving motive<br>
power, the excess motive power may be used for generating electric power.<br>
The obtained electric power may be used in the production process.<br>
The steam which supplies a rotating energy to the back pressure steam<br>
turbine becomes low pressure superheated steam at the temperature about<br>
from 120°C to 300°C and a pressure of about from 0.1 MPaG to 1.0 MPaG<br>
(hereinafter, called as low pressure steam A) is discharged. In the invention,<br>
at least a part of the low pressure steam A is utilized as a heat source for a<br>
regenerator of an absorption type refrigerator. Further, a part of the<br>
remaining is preferably utilized as a heat source for a re-boiler in a distillation<br>
step for refining acrylic acid. In this case, it is preferable that water is<br>
supplied to the low pressure steam A to make a saturated steam at the<br>
temperature from 120°C to 183°C. It is because undesired polymerization of<br>
acrylic acid or the like is caused if the temperature is too high, and also heat<br>
transfer efficiency of the saturated steam is better in the case that a<br>
multi-tubular heat exchanger is used as the regenerator or the re-boiler. As<br>
the method of supplying water to the low pressure steam A, water may be<br>
conveyed by a pump or the like to the middle of a line in which the discharged<br>
gas from the back pressure steam turbine is supplied to the regenerator of the<br><br>
absorption type refrigerator (or to the re-boiler in a distillation step).<br>
As the absorption type refrigerator, conventionally known facilities<br>
capable of carrying out cycles of<br>
evaporation→absorption→regeneration→condensation→evaporation of a<br>
coolant may be employed. Water, ammonia, and the like may be used as the<br>
coolant, and lithium bromide, water, and the like may be used as an absorption<br>
liquid for the absorption. The regenerator evaporates the coolant from the<br>
absorption liquid diluted with the coolant and recovers the absorption liquid,<br>
and the low pressure steam A is utilized for a heat source for evaporation.<br>
Cold water obtained in the absorption type refrigerator can be used for<br>
a cooling step in the production process of acrylic acid and in other<br>
polymerization processes of acrylic acid ester or acrylic acid. In the cooling<br>
step, a condenser, a cooler or the like may be employed. In the case of<br>
carrying out crystallization in a refining step of acrylic acid, the cold water<br>
may be used for the crystallization step. As the cold water, an aqueous<br>
solution of ethylene glycol, an aqueous solution of methanol and the like<br>
besides water alone may be used.<br>
In the case that excess low pressure steam A remains after the low<br>
pressure steam A is used as a heat source for the regenerator of the absorption<br>
type refrigerator and the re-boiler in the distillation step, the low pressure<br>
steam A may be supplied to a condensing steam turbine to recover energy of<br>
the steam as electric power. The recovered electric power may be used as an<br>
electric power source for a pump and the like in the production process of<br>
acrylic acid. Accordingly, no steam is purged without avail and almost all of<br>
the steam recovered from the reaction heat generated in the gas-phase<br>
catalytic oxidation reaction can be effectively utilized.<br>
On the other hand, in the case that low pressure steam (hereinafter,<br>
called as low pressure steam B) is generated instead of the high pressure<br>
steam in the steam generation apparatus, at least a part of the low pressure<br>
steam B is preferably utilized as a heat source for the regenerator of the<br><br>
absorption type refrigerator or the re-boiler in the distillation step, similarly to<br>
the case of utilizing the low pressure steam A. If there remains excess low<br>
pressure steam B, similarly to the above-mentioned case, the low pressure<br>
steam B is supplied to a condensing steam turbine to recover electric power.<br>
In the case that the steam generating apparatus is installed<br>
independently in each of the first stage reactor and in the second stage reactor,<br>
the high pressure steam may be generated in the first stage reactor and the<br>
low pressure steam B may be generated in the second stage reactor, for<br>
instance (needless to say, the installation vice versa is allowed, however the<br>
reaction condition in the first stage reactor is generally suitable for obtaining<br>
the high pressure steam). In this case, the high pressure steam obtained in<br>
the first stage reactor is supplied to the back pressure steam turbine connected<br>
with a blower to use for driving the blower as described above. A part of the<br>
discharged gas (low pressure steam A) and the low pressure steam B obtained<br>
in the second stage reactor may be used for a heat source for the regenerator of<br>
the absorption type refrigerator and a part of the remaining may be used for<br>
the re-boiler in the distillation step. If excess low pressure steam A and/or B<br>
still remains, it may be converted into electric power by the condensing steam<br>
turbine.<br>
In the invention, heat of the product gas produced in the reactor may<br>
be recovered. In this case, it is preferable that the product gas may be<br>
supplied to a waste heat boiler to recover the heat of the reaction product gas<br>
before supplied to an absorbing column and low pressure steam is generated.<br>
The operation temperature of the waste heat boiler is preferably 140°C or more,<br>
because if it is lower than 140°C, clogging in equipments may occur by<br>
deposition of easy-to-clog substances. The low pressure steam generated in<br>
the waste heat boiler may be used for a heat source for the regenerator of the<br>
absorption type refrigerator or the re-boiler in the distillation step, or may be<br>
supplied to the condensing steam turbine, similarly to the aforementioned low<br>
pressure steam A or the low pressure steam B. It is also possible to recover<br><br>
high pressure steam in the waste heat boiler, and so steam is properly selected<br>
based on operation conditions.<br>
The reaction product gas passed through the waste heat boiler is<br>
supplied to an absorbing column. The type of the absorbing column is not<br>
particularly limited. For example, trays such as a bubble cap tray, a sieve<br>
tray, a valve tray, a dual flow tray, a baffle tray, a ripple tray or the like packing<br>
regular fillers of a gauze type, a sheet type, a grid type or the like, or irregular<br>
fillers may be usable.<br>
As a collecting solvent, water, low boiling point solvents such as organic<br>
acid-containing water, and high boiling point solvents such as diphenyl ether<br>
and diphenyl may be used. The mass flow rate of the collecting solvent is<br>
preferably 0.1 times to 1.5 times to that of acrylic acid contained in the reaction<br>
product gas. When the ratio of the mass flow rate (solvent/acrylic acid) is<br>
lower than 0.1 times, the loss of acrylic acid may be possibly increased. On<br>
the other hand, when the ratio of the mass flow rate (solvent/acrylic acid)<br>
exceeds 1.5 times, it becomes difficult to obtain a high concentration acrylic<br>
acid solution and therefore it is not preferable.<br>
If water is used as the collecting solvent, acrylic acid in the reaction<br>
product gas is caught in water to give an aqueous solution of acrylic acid with<br>
the acrylic acid concentration of about from 50 mass % to 98 mass %. The<br>
aqueous solution is supplied to a succeeding refining step, and dehydrated and<br>
refined in a step of distillation, crystallization or the like. In terms of<br>
downsizing of equipments necessary for the refining step and saving of energy<br>
consumption, it is preferable that the concentration of acrylic acid in the<br>
aqueous solution is 80 mass % to 98 mass %. In the case that the<br>
concentration of acrylic acid is 80 mass % to 98 mass %, the consumption of the<br>
steam obtained from the reaction heat or the like become relatively small in<br>
the refining step. In the present invention, however, as described above, the<br>
excess steam is advantageously used as a heat source for the absorption type<br>
refrigerator or for power generation by driving the turbine, and is not<br><br>
discharged without avail. When the concentration of acrylic acid is 80 mass %<br>
to 98 mass %, a part of the gas discharged from the top of the absorbing column<br>
is preferably recycled to the reactor in order to lower the loss of acrylic acid. It<br>
is recommended that the gas to be recycled is cooled by a condenser before the<br>
gas is turned back to the reactor. This is because the amount of water to be<br>
led to the reactor can be decreased.<br>
In the present invention, heat generated in combustion of a waste can<br>
be used as the heat source for steam generation. The waste means a part of<br>
waste gas discharged from the top of the absorbing column (a part of the gas is<br>
preferably recycled to the absorbing column after being cooled in a condenser)<br>
and waste gas and/or waste solution separated in the succeeding other steps<br>
(for example, refining steps such as distillation, crystallization or the like).<br>
The heat generated in combustion of these waste gases and/or waste solution is<br>
recovered as the high pressure steam and/or the low pressure steam by using<br>
the steam generation apparatus. The utilization method of the high pressure<br>
steam and the low pressure steam may be the same as in the case of the<br>
above-mentioned reaction heat. The waste gas and/or the waste solution may<br>
be burned in one combustor, or the waste gas and the waste solution may be<br>
separately burned in each combustor. Further, combustors may be installed<br>
in the respective steps where the waste gas and/or the waste solution are<br>
generated. One or a plurality of the steam generation apparatuses for<br>
converting the heat generated in these combustors to steam may be used.<br>
The high pressure steam, the low pressure steam A, and the low<br>
pressure steam B may be used as a power source and a heat source for various<br>
kinds of apparatuses which consume steam in the inside and outside of<br>
production plants in addition to the above-mentioned usages. It is preferable<br>
that the high pressure steam is supplied in priority to various kinds of<br>
apparatuses (for example, a blower, a compressor, and a pump) and driving<br>
appliances which require a relatively high temperature heat source, and that<br>
low pressure steams A and B are supplied to apparatuses such as a vacuum<br><br>
generator, a heat exchanger, a re-boiler, a heating apparatus, and the like, that<br>
are sufficient to be used relatively low temperature steam as a heat source.<br>
The supply of steam is not limited to the production plant of acrylic acid but<br>
also to places where steam is required such as an acrylic acid esterification<br>
plant and an acrylic acid polymerization plant.<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in more detail by<br>
way of Examples. However it is not intended that the present invention is<br>
limited to the described examples. All the modifications and substitutions are<br>
included in the scope of the invention as long" as not departing from the spirit<br>
and scope of the invention.<br>
Examples<br>
Acrylic acid was produced using propylene as a raw material. The<br>
reactor for a gas-phase catalytic oxidation reaction of propylene was a<br>
multi-tubular reactor divided in two stages of first and second. HTS (53<br>
mass % of potassium nitrate + 40 mass % of sodium nitrite + 7 mass % of<br>
sodium nitrate: so-called "niter") was used as a heat medium for both of the<br>
first stage reactor and the second stage reactor. A reaction in the first stage<br>
reactor was carried out at 300°C and a reaction in the second stage reactor was<br>
carried out at 260°C.<br>
Most of the niter which had removed a reaction heat was supplied to a<br>
heat medium boiler, a steam generating apparatus, to generate high pressure<br>
steam at a pressure of 2 MPaG at 29.2 T/hr. After the high pressure steam at<br>
a pressure of 2 MPaG was further superheated using a part of the niter, the<br>
steam was supplied to a back pressure steam turbine for driving a blower<br>
which supplied molecular oxygen-containing gas to the reactor. The<br>
discharged steam of the turbine was superheated low pressure steam at a<br>
pressure of 0.6 MPaG (29.2 T/hr) and water was supplied to a part of the<br><br>
superheated low pressure steam to recover saturated steam (1) having a<br>
pressure of 0.6 MPaG at 0.3 T/hr.<br>
Reaction product gas produced in the reactor was supplied to a waste<br>
heat boiler, a steam generating apparatus, to recover saturated steam (2)<br>
having a pressure of 0.6 MPaG at 0.8 T/hr. The reaction product gas<br>
discharged out of the waste heat boiler was supplied to an absorbing column to<br>
be caught in water. The concentration of acrylic acid in the collection solution<br>
obtained from the bottom of the column was 89.0 mass %. After being cooled<br>
in a condenser, a part of waste gas discharged from the top of the absorbing<br>
column was recycled to the reactor and the remaining was burned in a waste<br>
gas treatment equipment.<br>
High pressure steam at a pressure of 4 MPaG was recovered at 11.7<br>
T/hr from combustion heat generated by the waste gas burned. The high<br>
pressure steam at a pressure of 4 MPaG was consumed entirely in a<br>
neighboring water-absorbent polymer production facility.<br>
12.1 T/hr of the steam from 30.3 T/hr of the steam in total of 29.2 T/hr<br>
of the low pressure steam at a pressure of 0.6 MPaG, which was the discharged<br>
steam of the back pressure steam turbine, 0.3 T/hr of the saturated steam (1)<br>
at a pressure of 0.6 MPaG, and 0.8 T/hr of the saturated steam (2) at a<br>
pressure of 0.6 MPaG, which was recovered by the waste heat boiler, was<br>
supplied to a regenerator of an absorption type refrigerator as a heat source,<br>
and then cold water was obtained. The cold water was used for crystallization<br>
step, which was a production (refining) step of acrylic acid. Furthermore, 6.6<br>
T/hr of the steam was consumed in a re-boiler and a vacuum generator in the<br>
refining step of the acrylic acid production process. The remaining, that was<br>
11. 6 T/hr of the superheated low pressure steam, was supplied to a condensing<br>
turbine to obtain 1554 kW of electric power. The average electric power<br>
consumption of a pump or the like in the acrylic acid production process was<br>
about 1700 kW, and accordingly, electric power to be bought from the outside<br>
was able to be decreased to about 150 kW. No steam was purged to the<br><br>
atmospheric air without being consumed.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
The production method of an organic acid of the invention comprises<br>
generating high pressure steam and low pressure steam method, and utilizing<br>
these steams directly for rotation energy of a blower and production of cold<br>

utilization efficiency is improved as compared to in the case of once generating<br>
electric power from the steams and using the electric power for driving a<br>
blower or operating a refrigerator. Furthermore, since electric power is<br>
generated using excess low pressure steam, most of the electric power<br>
necessary in the process can be self-supplied.<br>
