				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for producing Gabapentin, l-(aminomethyl)-l-cyclohexaneacetic acid from Gabapentin hydrochloride salt. The process is directed to improvement in the manufacture of Gabapentin which would be industrially feasible and facilitate simple and cost-effective manufacture of Gabapentin. Gabapentin obtained following the process of the invention is suitable as a drug especially in the treatment of cerebral diseases such as epilepsy.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Gabapentin, l-(aminomethyl)-l-cyclohexaneacetic acid is known to have the chemical structure as hereunder:<br><br>
Gabapentin is used in the treatment of cerebral diseases such as epilepsy. There are various methods presently known for preparing Gabapentin from a variety of starting materials. U.S. Patent 4,024,175 describes at least three methods of preparing Gabapentin from cyclohexyl-1,1-diacetic acid. Each of these methods results in the formation of Gabapentin hydrochloride salt, which may be converted to l-(aminomethyl)- 1-cyclohexaneacetic acid by treatment with a basic ion exchanger and then crystallized from a solvent such as ethanol/ether.<br>
U.S. Patent 4,894,476 specifically discloses an improved method for converting the hydrochloride salt into the free amino acid. This involves pouring a deionized water solution<br><br>
from the elute, adding an alcohol to the slurry, centrifuging and drying the slurry to obtain the free amino acid.<br>
Alternative methods for preparing Gabapentin have been described that do not proceed via the hydrochloride or any other mineral acid salt. Such methods include those described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,132,451, 5,095,148, 5,068,413. Each of these methods involve a cyanic intermediate which is hydrogenated under severe conditions to produce the free amino acid.<br>
These methods are industrially impractical. Those methods comprising ion exchange columns require the use of large amounts of ion exchanger for lengthy periods of time to lower the level of chloride ions to the desired level. The alternative methods involve further more demanding steps.<br>
WO 98/28255 describes the preparation of Gabapentin from Gabapentin hydrochloride through optional pre-treatment to remove inorganic salts and then by treating suitable organic amines like triethylamine, tributylamine, tripropylamine, trihexylamine, diethylamine, ethanolamine and benzylamine. Preferably the amine is tributylamine.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is thus the basic object of the present invention to provide a process of producing Gabapentin which would be simple and avoid the aforediscussed problems of the known art.<br>
Another object of the present invention is directed to a process for the manufacture of Gabapentin from Gabapentin hydrochloride salt which would avoid severe conditions and/or complexities and can be readily adopted for industrial application.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is directed to provide a method of manufacture of Gabapentin which would have good yield and not involve lengthy extended process steps.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a method of manufacture of Gabapentin which would be cost-effective and can be carried out involving simple and readily available ingredients starting material.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Thus according to the present invention there is provided a process of producing Gabapentin<br>
comprising :<br>
i)	providing  an aqueous alkaline solution of Gabapentin, Hydrochloride salt and<br>
reacting with Sulfuric acid followed by neutralizing with inorganic base; ii)        filtration of inorganic salts and distillation to obtain a resultant solid ; iii)       dissolving the said resultant solid of (ii) above in an protic solvent, filtering to<br>
remove further   inorganic salts followed by distillation of the resulting solvent to<br>
obtained a residue; iv)       adding another solvent to said residue and isolating Gabapentin therefrom by<br>
filtration.<br>
In the above process the inorganic bases can be selected from metal hydroxide or carbonate of Ha of periodic table preferably barium hydroxide.<br>
The alkali used in the process can be selected from such as Sodium hydroxide, Potassium hydroxide, Calcium hydroxide and alkali metal hydroxides, carbonates.<br>
The first solvents employed can be selected from Methanol, Acetonitrile, Isopropyl alcohol, acetone.<br>
The 'second' solvent can be selected from Isopropanol, acetone, Methanol, Acetonitrile, Dimethylformamide, Ethyl Acetate, Diisopropylether, Methylene choride.<br>
The above process of the present invention provide an improved, industrially feasible method for preparing Gabapentin from Gabapentin hydrochloride. The process avoids the disadvantages associated with prior art methods and selectively employs the inorganic bases to convert Gabapentin hydrochloride to Gabapentin. Gabapentin hydrochloride used in the process can be prepared by the method known in prior art such as US Patent No. 4152326 (1979).<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION :<br>
In accordance with a preferred aspect the process of the invention comprises:<br>
(1)	mixing aqueous solution of the Gabapentin hydrochloride with alkali;<br>
(2)	filtration to  separate solid and heating with dil.  Sulfuric acid followed by pH adjustment to neutral with inorganic bases at 30 - 80°C.<br>
(3)	filtration of inorganic salts in particular sulfate and concentration of filtrate under vacuum.<br>
(4)	redissolving the resultant solid in protic solvent (first solvent).<br>
(5)	filtration of traces of inorganic salt in particular sulfate salts if any.<br>
(6)	concentration of protic solvent to dryness.<br>
(7)	addition of second solvent and isolation of Gabapentin by filtration.<br>
Thus the initial critical stages of the process of the present invention comprises of mixing of an aqueous solution of Gabapentin hydrochloride with alkali metal hydroxide or carbonate solutions. Filtration of separated solids and reacting with dil. Sulfuric acid and then adjusting pH to neutral with inorganic base.<br>
The subsequent critical steps of the process is the removal of water by distillation from the filtrate after filtration of corresponding sulfate salt. The water may be distilled off at atmospheric pressure or under vacuum The next step involves the addition of protic solvent (first solvent) to dissolve Gabapentin and filtration of traces of, if any, corresponding sulfate salt. In the next step the solvent from the filtrate is removed and addition of 'second' solvent and filtration of Gabapentin. The solvent may be distilled at atmospheric pressure or under vacuum.<br>
Preferably, the Gabapentin hydrochloride salt is used as a solution in water in concentration ranging from 10 to 40%, more preferably 33%.<br>
The inorganic bases are preferably used as solid and/or as aqueous solution of concentration 5 to 15% more preferably 10%.<br><br>
The temperature of neutralization is selected from RT 30°C to 80°C preferably 40°C. the final pH of the neutralization is about 5 to 8 preferably 7.<br>
The process of the invention, its objects and advantages are explained hereunder in greater detail by way of the non-limiting exemplary illustrations of the process as discussed hereunder: Example 1 :<br>
Gabapentin hydrochloride (10 g.) was dissolved in water 30 ml. and heated to 40~60°C. To this solution was added Sodium hydroxide to pH 9.0 to 14.0 and the reaction mixture heated at 40-60°C for 3 to 6 hrs. The reaction mass is cooled to 5-10°C and maintained at this temperature for 6 hrs. The separated solid is filtered and added to dil. Sulfuric acid 30 ml. (5 ml. Sulfuric acid diluted to 30 ml. with water).<br>
The reaction mixture heated under reflux for 12 hrs. and then cooled to 30°C. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 7.0 to 7.5 with barium hydroxide suspension in water. The separated barium sulfate is filtered off and wash with water 10 ml. The filtrate is concentrated to dryness under vacuum. Methanol (120 ml.) added to the residue and then clear solution is filtered through Celite. Methanol is recovered under vacuum at below 50°C. The product remained was treated with Iso-propanol (50 ml.), stirred of 30 min. at RT and filtered off. The product obtained is dried till content weight of 6.7 g. Examples 2-9 :<br>
The method of Example 1 was followed using different solvents shown in Tablel alongwith percentage yield (w/w)<br><br><br>
