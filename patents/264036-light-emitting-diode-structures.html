				<td>LIGHT EMITTING DIODE STRUCTURES<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to light emitting diodes (LEDs) and in particular to LEDs with improved efficiency.<br>
Background to the invention<br>
LEDs have many potential applications. For example, LEDs can be used in displays, such as LCDs and in projection, entertainment, general lighting and automotive applications where high brightness and compact illumination is required. The benefits of LEDs over conventional incandescent lighting and halogen lighting are high brightness, long life, instant operation, energy saving, environmental friendliness, durability and compactness.<br>
Notwithstanding those benefits, most of the light generated inside a conventional LED cannot be efficiently extracted from the active layer. Almost 80% of the light generated in an LED is outside the escape cone of the structure. Most of the light remains either guided in the core or totally internally reflected in the high refractive index substrate layer.<br>
The potential for increasing the efficiency, and in particular the light extraction efficiency, of LEDs has long been recognised. For example, the difference between the refractive index of a high index substrate (n~3.5) and that of the epoxy used to encapsulate the LED (n-1.5) is large, resulting in a relatively small critical angle for total internal reflection. This in turn dramatically restricts the external quantum efficiency compared to that of the internal quantum efficiency. It has been realised that using an optically transparent conductive layer and a cladding with a low refractive index and transmitting substrates with a low refractive index improves light extraction efficiencies.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a method that has been used to improve directionality of light emitted from the LED structure. Figure 1a shows the 6 light escape cones from the active layer of an LED. Figure 1b shows the use of a<br><br>
Distributed Bragg Reflector 104 located underneath the active layer, which reflects light back up and out of the LED. The use of a Distributed Bragg Reflector is used to direct more light out of the top of the LED structure emitting power in a specific angular cone. This technique is described in US 6,015,719.<br>
Alternatively, or additionally, the use of microlens arrays placed on the top surface of an LED structure can provide enhanced extraction. This was first proposed in US 5,087,949. It has also been suggested by S Moller et al. in Journal of Applied Physics 91,3324 that attaching the microlens array on an organic LED (OLED) glass substrate can provide similar benefits to those found with semiconductors LEDs, where an external coupling efficiency improvement of x2.3 across the complete viewing half space was observed.<br>
An illustration of the use of microlens arrays on the surface of an LED structure is shown in Figure 2. Numeral 201 shows the out of plane coupling of light. A microlens array 202 is placed on the top of a glass substrate 203 which covers the active layer of a conventional LED.<br>
Figure 3 shows the use of angled facets to preferentially reflect light combined in the active layer out of the top surface of the structure. The active layer 302 and the overlying cladding layer have tapered side walls 305. A metal contact 303 is shown on the top surface. The light generated in the active layer reflects off the walls 305 and exits the top of the structure. This is described in US 6,015,719.<br>
The use of high index polymers that are optically clear can significantly reduce reflection losses at the semiconductor substrate/air interface. This is illustrated in Figure 4. Figure 4a shows a conventional low index gel 401 on an LED, The escape cone angle from the active layer 404 is shown as 402. The fundamental waveguide mode angle 403 lies outside the escape cone. Figure 4b shows the use of a high index gel. The use of a high index gel 406 provides a reduced refractive index contrast and hence provides a larger escape cone angle 407 for the totally internally reflected light. The fundamental waveguide mode angle 405 now lies within the escape cone. A light output increase of around 20% can be achieved by the variation of refractive index from 1.46 to 1.60.<br><br>
Another approach taken to improve the extraction efficiency of LEDs is taught by Schnitzer et al in Applied Physics Letters 63, 2174 (1993). This paper describes the use of random texturing or roughening of the surface of the semiconductor LED as shown in Figure 5. Referring to Figure 5, the roughening 503 on the surface of the LED provides multiple miniature domains with different escape angles. When the totally internally reflected light from the active layer 502 is incident on one of those surfaces it has an increased probability of lying in the escape angle of that surface as compared to a totally flat surface. This provides an improved extraction efficiency. While this method is efficient at extracting light that is experiencing multiple total internal reflections due to absorptive regions within an LED, the light is rapidly attenuated and hence does not contribute to orders of magnitude light extraction and improvement.<br>
In US 5,779,924 the use of periodic texturing on at least onerinterface of the structure is described and is suggested to improve the extraction of light out of the active core layer 603. This is shown in Figure 6. The periodic texturing 602 directs more light out of the structure without totally internally reflecting the light inside the structure, where it is greatly attenuated.<br>
Instead of periodic texturing, photonic crystals have been used to achieve the same effect of enhanced light extraction. This is described in US 5,955,749.<br>
Surface roughening, periodic texturing and regular photonic crystals all enhance light extraction from LEDs through the same mechanism, that of modifying the surface profile to improve the probability that light generated in the active layer incident on the surface will be incident at an angle to the surface which allows it to escape from the structure.<br>
Regular photonic crystals (PCs) can also lead to greater light extraction via another mechanism. It is well known that it is generally not desirable to etch into the active layer due to increased surface recombination of carriers, which affects the overall photoluminescence quantum efficiency of the active layer. Nevertheless, if the PC is in close proximity to the active layer it is possible to enhance the rate of spontaneous emission through the Purcell effect. In the<br><br>
Purcell effect it is suggested that the spontaneous emission OT an aiom within a wavelength-sized microcavity can be increased when compared to a bulk structure. A regular photonic crystal 704, as shown in Figure 7, can confine an optical mode in a "cavity" 707 by virtue of the effective refractive index contrast experienced by the optical mode in the active layer 705. The emitted light is shown as 703.<br>
Erchak et al, in App. Phys. Lett. Vol.78, no. 5, 29 Jan 2001, Pg. 563-565 have reported a 6-fold increase in light due to increased extraction and radiation efficiency by the use of a PC embedded in an LED.<br>
Alternative proposed designs suggest grating type PC structures. In this set-up it is suggested that the direct transmitted mode drains only 20% of the total photons while 50% of the light is confined in high index guided modes. The high-index guided modes are very efficiently coupled into external modes and launched out of the structure.<br>
However, due to the highly diffractive nature of regular photonic crystals, the far field emission out of the top of LED structures is localised into Bragg spots (which follows the periodic lattice nature of the PC structure), as shown in Figure 8. Figure 8 shows in cross-section a regular photonic crystal 802 in an LED structure with an active layer 804, as shown in Figure 7. The structure is also shown from above. The out of plane coupled light 801 forms a far filed illumination pattern 805 consisting of a number of Bragg spots. For most applications it is desirable to achieve more even illumination in the far field.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide improved light extraction from LEDs whilst obtaining desirable far-field illumination.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
According to a first aspect of the present invention, a light emitting diode (LED) structure including an active core layer and at least one substrate layer having afirst refractive index, comprises a 2-dimensionai photonic quasicrystal (PQC) in the structure, the photonic quasicrystal comprising an array of regions having a second refractive index, the array exhibiting long range order but short<br><br>
range disorder,   The long range order is associated with diffractive properties of the structure.<br>
Quasicrystals are aperiodic structures which possess a type of long range transiational order called quasiperiodicity. A detailed discussion of quasicrystals is found in "Quasicrystals: A matter of definition" by Ron Lifshitz, Foundations of Physics, vol. 33, no. 12, December 2003 and includes a mathematical definition of quasiperiodic. In this specification, quasicrystal should be taken to include ail quasiperiodic structures, excluding regular periodic structures.<br>
Preferably, the Fourier transform of the array has a degree of rotational symmetry n, where n&gt;6. The high degree of symmetry of photonic quasicrystals of this type results in photonic bandgaps with a high degree of isotropy. Complete bandgaps can be achieved even with a low refractive index contrast.<br>
The bandgap may be designed (by varying the spacing between the nearest neighbour regions, as well as the diameter, depth and index of the regions) so that a stopband overlaps with the emission spectrum of the active layer in the LED. Bandgap design for regular photonic crystals in this way is well known. Preferably, the bandgap is in all directions and for all polarisations.<br>
LEDs incorporating photonic quasicrystals in accordance with the present invention have an improved extraction efficiency over conventional LEDs and over LEDs incorporating regular photonic crystals. Quasicrystal structures offer a number of benefits. For example, more isotropic bandgaps found in Photonic quasicrystals leads to greater mode confinement and hence greater extraction efficiency. It is noted that ordinary photonic crystals suffer from anisotropic bandgaps which do not overlap for different propagation directions (except for high refractive index contrasts) and hence do not confine a single wavelength of light with the same penetration depth in all directions. Furthermore, the long range order which is a property of quasicrystals leads to more uniform far field diffraction patterns. Close packing of regions made possible in quasicrystal structures leads to a greater surface area through which photons can exit the structure and hence greater extraction efficiency.<br><br>
Preferably, the substrate layer is a dielectric layer and the quasicrysta! is a variation in refractive index extending partially or completely across the layer. Alternatively, an additional layer of different refractive index, or formed from a metal, can be positioned in the substrate layer or between the core layer and the substrate layer, the additional layer comprising an array of regions arranged in a quasicrystal geometry.<br>
The quasicrystal may be in the form of a Fibonacci spiral pattern. Alternatively, the array may be in a Penrose tiling pattern. It may also be in a non-uniform Euclidean tiling pattern.<br>
An LED in accordance with the present invention may include photonic quasicrystals in more than one layer. For, example, the active layer may be sandwiched between a pair of photonic quasicrystal layers. The LED may include a plurality of different photonic quasicrystals or a combination of photonic quasicrystals and ordinary photonic crystals.<br>
The substrate layer may include a section of photoinc quasicrystal that is repeated periodically.<br>
The regions of quasicrystal may be of any shape and size, and may vary in their geometric or material properties across the array. The quasicrystal may include regions of tunable material to provide for a tunable optical output.<br>
According to a second aspect of the present invention, a light emitting diode (LED) structure including an active core layer and a least one substrate layer having a first refractive index, comprises a 2-dimensional photonic band structure in the substrate layer, the photonic band structure comprising an array of regions having a second refractive index, wherein each region has a predetermined constant spacing from at least one other region and each region is spaced from all other regions by a predetermined minimum distance but wherein the array of regions is amorphous.<br>
According to a third aspect of the present invention, a method of extracting light from an LED structure comprises the step of providing a 2-dimensional photonic quasicrystal in the LED structure, the photonic quasicrystal exhibiting long range order but short range disorder.<br>
According to a fourth aspect of the present invention, a method of<br><br>
manufacturing an LED structure comprises the steps of:<br>
providing an active core layer;<br>
providing at least one substrate layer; and<br>
forming a photonic quas'tcrystal in the substrate layer, the photonic quasicrystal exhibiting long range order but short range disorder.<br>
According to a fifth aspect of the present invention, a method of manufacturing an LED structure comprises the steps of:<br>
providing an active core layer;<br>
providing at least one substrate layer having a first refractive index; and<br>
forming a photonic band structure in the substrate layer, the photonic band structure comprising an array of regions having a second refractive index, wherein each region has a predetermined constant spacing from at ieast one other region and each region is spaced from ail other regions by a predetermined minimum distance but wherein the array of regions is amorphous,<br>
LEDs in accordance with the first or second aspect of the invention may be incorporated into a great many optical systems such as a vehicle headlamp or a dashboard display, a projection system or traffic lights, to name a few examples.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
There are three possible uniform tilings of the plane by regular polygons, using squares, triangles or hexagons. In 1 -uniform tilings there is only one type of vertex in the plane. Additionally there are 13 different orientations for filling<br><br>
the space using 1-uniform (Archimedian) tilings. These tiling patterns form the basis of what, in this specification, will be referred to as regular 2D photonic crystals. Regular 2D photonic crystals are typically formed in dielectric material and have an array of regions forming a periodic variation in refractive index, the periodicity based on one of the uniform tilings of the plane. The simplest example of a photonic crystal of this type is an array of holes in a dielectric slab, an etched air rod being positioned at each vertex of a uniform tiling pattern.<br>
Photonic crystals offer unique ways to tailor light and the propagation of electromagnetic (EM) waves. By analogy to electrons in a crystal, EM waves propagating in a structure with a periodically-modulated dielectric constant set up Bloch modes that form photonic band structures. Due to the dielectric contrast and periodicity, photonic bandgaps are set up where EM propagation is forbidden.<br>
2-dimensiona! photonic crystals have been suggested for use in LEDs to improve light extraction. There are two mechanisms by which photonic crystals can improve light extraction from LEDs:<br>
(1)	Surface patterning can increase the likelihood of tight escaping the<br>
structure before being totally internally reflected and attenuated in the substrate<br>
of the LED;<br>
(2)	Enhancement of spontaneous emission in the active layer by the<br>
Purcell effect.<br>
However, regular 2-dimensiona! photonic crystals in LEDs give rise to often undesirable far field diffraction patterns. Furthermore, the Purcell effect has a limited effect using regular 2-dimensional photonic crystals in LED structures as light confinement is not isotropic.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, a 2-dimensional quasicrystal is used in a layer of a LED structure other than the active layer. A photonic quasicrystal (PQC) is a photonic band structure that exhibits short range translational disorder but long range, quasiperiodic order. Examples are described by Zoorobetal. In Nature 2000, vol.404,13 April 2000 and possess complete bandgaps even in low index materials. Photonic quasicrystals have<br><br>
very isotropic bandgaps. Quasicrystals provide benefits both in terms of the output light pattern generated by the LED in which they are embedded and in terms of the Purcell effect.<br>
Photonic quasicrystals are formed in the same way as regular photonic crystals. A2-dimensionaI quasicrystal can be composed of an array of rods of dielectric material or an array of holes in a dielectric material. Generally, a 2-dimensiona! quasicrysta! can be described as an array of rods of a second refractive index in a background material of a first refractive index. In the present invention, the photonic quasicrystal is designed by selecting the spacing between the nearest neighbour rods as well as the diameter, depth and index of the rods, so that it overlaps with the emission spectrum of the active layer in the LED. This provides wavelength selectivity as well as enhanced modal confinement. Ideally, the bandgap is in all directions and for all polarisations.<br>
The Purcel! effect will now be briefly described. The spontaneous emission enhancement factor described by the Purcell effect is given by the following equation:<br>
where /=wavelength, n=refractive index V=volume of cavity, Q=confinement factor (which is proportional to the time a photon is confined in the cavity).<br>
From this equation it is clear that the smaller the volume the larger the enhancement factor. By placing an appropriately designed photonic quasicrystal structure with strong light confinement (ideally with a bandgap overlapping the emission spectrum of the active layer) close to the active layer small confinement volumes can be produced throughout the quasicrystal structure without the need for defects. If the light is emitted in the vicinity of the photonic bandgap the high Q factor gives rise to strong localisation effects in the active layer, leading to dramatic increases in spontaneous emission. The<br><br>
fact that photonic quasicrystals have such isotropicbandgaps further enhances the confinement and hence the spontaneous emission. It should be noted in this regard that regular 2-dimensional photonic crystals have anisotropic bandgaps which do not overlap for all propagation directions and hence would not confine the light sufficiently in all directions.<br>
In an LED structure a photonic quasicrystal can be provided in one of the layers in a number of ways. The quasicrystal can be defined by a variation in the height of one of the layers or interfaces in the LED. Alternatively, a variation in the refractive index of a specific region can define the vertex of one element in the quasicrystal. The refractive index of the structure can be varied by doping the desired region by diffusion or by ion implantation, while the height of a particular layer can be defined by etching a specific region. (Ion implantation is a well known technique and is described in Dearnaley, G., Freeman, J. H., Nelson, R. S., Stephen, J. Ion Implantation; American Elsevier Publishing Co., New York, 1973; 802 pp.).<br>
Figure 9 illustrates four different examples in accordance with the present invention. Figure 9a shows schematically an LED structure in which a photonic quasicrystal 901 has been etched into the surface. Figure 9b shows a photonic quasicrystal 902 embedded in one layer 903 of an LED structure. A structure of this type can be formed by etching in to the desired layer and subsequently overgrowing the overlying layers. Figure 9c shows a photonic quasicrystal 904 formed by diffusing a dopant into predetermined locations to locally vary the refractive index in the structure. This can be achieved by lithographically defining a mask, which is later etched and used as a template for ion implantation or diffusion. An electrical contact 905 and active layer 906 are shown, as in Figures 9a and 9b.<br>
Figure 9d shows a photonic quasicrystal 908 in an LED structure which penetrates the active layer. This is possible using low surface recombination material systems such as a GaN material system 907, because in a GaN material system surface recombination effects are less significant and hance do not affect the spontaneous emission as much as in other known LED material systems, such as GaAs. Forming the photonic quasicrystai in the<br><br>
active layer provides much greater confinement of optical modes (owing to increased effective refractive index contrast in the active layer) and stronger interaction with the photonic band structure. This stronger confinement allows for both the formation of smaller cavities and higher Q factors. This dramatically enhances the Purcell effect. The Purcell effect in GaN, using a regular photonic crystal is discussed in Shakya J., Kim K.H., et al., "Enhanced light extraction in Ill-nitride UV Photonic Crystal light-emitting diodes", APL vol. 85, no. 1, 5 July 2004, Pg. 142-144.<br>
Figure 10 shows in detail a possible design for a high efficiency microcavity LED using a GaAs material system emitting at an approximate wavelength of 960nm. This design was proposed in (IEEE J. Select Top. In Quan. Elect. Vol. 8, no. 2, Pg 238-247, Mar 2002) and incorporates a high contrast DBR structure underneath the active layer 1002-1808. Each period of the DBR is composed of a layer of relatively low index A!0X (n~1.7) and a layer of high index GaAs (n~3.5). This provides a large dielectric contrast reflector giving rise to 92% of the downward emitting light being reflected back up.<br>
Sitting on top of the DBR is the thin p-n junction. Squeezed between the p-n junction is a GRIN-SCH (Graded index separate confinement heterostructure) to confine the carriers and the light emission in a smaller active region, giving rise to a lower emission threshold.<br>
The p electrical contact 1021 and the n electrical contact 1022 are deposited on layer 1019 and layer 1009 respectively. The layers 1002-1019 are grown using MBE (molecular beam epitaxy) or MOCVD (Metal Organic Chemical Vapour Deposition). The fabrication involves six photolithographic steps. A first photolithographic process to define the deep trenches is performed. A wet etch (using concentrated H3P04:H2O2) is used to form deep trenches 1024 for the initiation of oxidation (2hr at 450°C) of the AlGaAs DBR layers. A second photolithographic process to define the 1022 contact location is spun. A selective wet etch to remove the top AlGaAs layers 1016-1018 and the top GaAs 1018-1019 is used. A third photolithographic process is used to evaporate the n-contact composed of Ni (10nm)-Ge(25nm)-Au(50nm)-Ni(20nm)-Au(100nm). A fourth photolithographic process to spin an inert<br><br>
material into the deep trench (1824) is performed.  A fifth photolithographic process is finally used to evaporate the p-contact of Au(200nm).<br>
Layers 1011 -1017 are shown in enlarged form in Figure 10 for clarity. Table A below described the layers referenced in Figure 10, with their thicknesses and material.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Figure 11 shows in detail an example of a photonic quasicrystal LED design in accordance with the present invention, with a twelve-fold symmetric photonic quasicrystal arrangement of air rods 1103, The thicknesses of the various layers are not to scale for clarity. Figure 11 a is a perspective view of the LED and Figure 11b is a cross section of the same structure.<br>
Table B below shows the various layers referenced in Figure 11 with their thicknesses and material type.<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br><br>
The LED shown in Figure 11 can be formed in the same manner as described with reference to Figure 10. The photonic quasicrystal is formed using an additional photolithographic etch. The etched holes may subsequently be filled with another material.<br>
The LED emits light over the extent of the photonic quasicrystal region. The actual quasicrystal pattern used in an LED depends on the application. As described above, ordinary 2-dimensional photonic crystals give rise to undesirable far field diffraction patterns. A regular four fold symmetric square lattice Photonic Crystal (PC) possesses a regular arrangement of bright Bragg spots in the far field, as shown in Figure 8. If the symmetry is increased to sixfold, a triangular lattice PC projects a far field emission with a similar lattice pattern.<br>
To rapidly predict the far field emission pattern generated by the LED due to the patterned photonic tiling imprint, a two dimensional optical transform of the photonic tiling is calculated. The arrangement of Bragg peaks formed by the transform represent the bright spots generated if the light projected from the top of the LED structure is collected in the far field on an observation plane.<br>
In order to get a reasonably uniform far-field illumination it is preferred that the Fourier transform of the array of regions in the quasicrystal has an order of rotational symmetry greater than six.<br>
A photonic quasicrystal (PQC) can be designed to possess a highly symmetric structure, such as the 12-fold symmetric square-triangle tiling PQC shown in Figure 12. Figure 12a illustrates the LED structure in cross-section with the arrow 1201 signifying the light coupling out of the structure. Light is generated in the active layer 1202 and is extracted by the photonic quasicrystal 1203. The escape cone angle of the LED is shown as 1204. Figure 12b shows a perspective view of the LED of figure 12a, more clearly illustrating the quasicrystal pattern. The resulting diffraction pattern in the far field is also shown. Figure 12c is an enlarged view of the far field diffraction pattern. The 12-fold symmetric structure provides more Bragg peaks in the Fourier space than a regular photonic crystal, 12 bright peaks surrounding a central Bragg spot in the case of the example shown in Figure 12c, and leads to a more circular diffraction pattern rather than the bright Bragg spots generated by a regular PC lattice. The generation of a greater number of far field spots in a given area provides more even illumination.<br>
Alternatively, to provide a more circular and even illumination alternative higher order symmetry structures could also be used, such as the sunflower structure.<br>
The sunflower structure is based on a Fibonacci spiral pattern. Preferably, in a Cartesian coordinate system, the Fibonacci spiral pattern is defined asxn=cos(n(p)\/n and yn=sy'/?(ncp)\/n where cp=Tr{\/5-1), and where n is the integer index for a point in the pattern. To generate the pattern a point is plotted for each value of n. Those values may be n=1, 2, 3, 4....etc.. Alternatively, certain values of n may selectively omitted to create defects, ring patterns or zone plates. For example, odd values for n may be omitted leaving<br>
n=4,6, 8,10	etc.. In the Photonic quasicrysta!, rods are placed at each of the<br>
generated points.<br>
Figure 13 shows the resultant far field emission from the sunflower photonic quasicrystal structure. The sunflower provides an even ring like far field emission. Light is emitted across the extent of the photonic quasicrystal structure, The circularly symmetric band structure and band gap provides a compact microcavity where the light emission is greatly enhanced. Additionally, the sunflower pattern provides for optimal packing of rods which enhances light extraction. Each rod possesses a set amount of light extraction ability. Introducing a greater number of rods in a unit area provides increased effective filling fraction and hence increased light extraction.<br>
To provide improved extraction efficiency into specific far field emission cones different parameters can be varied. The spacing between neighbouring photonic quasicrystal rods, etch depth, rod diameter and rod shape can be altered (as shown in Figure 14 and Figure 15). Figure 14 shows the effect of varying the rod diameter and rod etch depth in a photonic quasicrysta! in an LED. The light emitted from an LED structure incorporating a photonic quaicrystal 1405 is indicated as 1401. The angular dependency of the emitted light is shown as an inset plot 1402 of angle versus intensity. Reduction of the rod diameter is indicated by arrow 1404. The light 1403 emitted from the altered structure is reduced, as shown by inset graph 1406. Reducing the etch depth of the rods is indicated by arrow 1408. It can be seen in inset graph<br>
1409 that the angle over which light is emitted is reduced by reducing etch depth.<br>
Figure 15 shows two different possible rod shapes. Figure 15a shows rods 1501 of square cross-section, positioned above the active layer 1502 of an LED. The rods 1501 are covered by an overlying layer. Figure 15b shows a similar structure to Figure 15a, with rods 1505 positioned above an active layer 1506. In this example, the rods are of circular cross-section.<br>
Additionally, the position of the photonic quasicrystal layer relative to the active layer (denoted by 1504 on Figure 15) can also be altered to provide tuning. The photonic quasicrystal can also equally be located below the active layer. These will alter the emission properties by extracting light at different efficiencies for different angular directions while also affecting the far field emission profile.<br>
The position of the photonic quasicrystal layer with respect to the active layer is highlighted by 1504 as shown in Figure 15. This variable is particularly critical in the enhancement of spontaneous emission from the active layer. The closer the photonic quasicrystal layer is to the active layer, the stronger the interaction of the emitted light with the photonic quasicrystal band structure. For the strongest interaction, a photonic quasicrystal layer is formed above and below the active region with spacing 1504 set to zero and preferably in the active layer as well if surface recombination is not critcal, such as in a GaN material system discussed with reference to Figure 9d.<br>
In any case, the photonic quasicrystal must be close enough to the active layer that the evanescent field of an optical mode in the active layer interacts with the photonic quasicrystal to set up a cavity mode. In a cavity mode, the mode is confined in the plane of the active layer and will eventually escape out of plane.<br>
The photonic quasicrystal can also be formed in a thin layer of metal (such as 50nm of Silver). This layer can be deposited on top of the active core. An interaction between the metal photonic quasicrystal (which can set up quasiperiodic surface plasmon modes) and the spontaneous emission allows<br>
the light to confine very strongly in the active layer introducing orders of magnitude increase in spontaneous emission.<br>
A key point for the use of photonic quasicrystal tilings in LEDs for light extraction is to avoid short range order, which eliminates the bright Bragg peaks, and the exploitation of the long range order to provide smooth, ring like interferences in the far field.<br>
In an alternative arrangement, a repeated section of a Photonic quasicrystal formed by a number of rods 1603 can be used in an LED structure. A finite number of elements from a quasicrystal tiling are selected as a supercell 1602. This supercell 1602 is then repeated in a periodic fashion to provide a large area photonic bandstructure 1601 with a highly symmetric diffractive nature, as shown in Figure 16.<br>
It should be noted that it is possible to generate cone like far field emission by the use of etched zone plate structures. These are composed of concentric etched rings, where the central region is designed to be active.<br>
The structures of the present invention are preferred to zone plate type structures for both structural and optical reasons. Structurally, less material is etched (quicker and more reliable manufacturing) providing a structurally more robust design with the pattern being more connected.<br>
Optically, the benefits are also greater. In the case of the zone plate, the active region is confined in the centre of the structure, where a large emitting area is surrounded by the zone plates. This leads to a large central area with no extraction capability, hence in this region light is only allowed to emit in the narrow escape cone and also to totally internally reflect. The totally internally reflected light is strongly attenuated and hence only minimal light extraction enhancements are achieved. This is shown in Figure 17. Figure 17a shows a zone plate structure 1702 which, in an LED, gives rise to ring-like emission 1701. Figure 17b shows the structure of figure 17 a in cross-section. Light from the active layer 1704 is strongly attenuated at the centre of the zone plate as indicated by 1703.<br>
The structure is only symmetric around the central disc, hence if light is emitted at the periphery of the disc or in between the zone plates the light is not<br>
extracted at the same cone angle hence leading to a ghosting effect in the far field emission.<br>
Furthermore, these structures do not benefit from Purcell type enhancements, because they do not set up cavity or localised modes inside the active layer.<br>
In the case of a Photonic quasicrystal, the highly diffractive structure is not defined by a radially symmetric structure; hence if light is emitted in any location in the structure it will interact with the band structure and couple out of the structure and generate the correct far field emission cone. This provides the capability of large areas emitting at a very well defined cone angle.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, amorphous photonic type structures are used in LED structures to provide a single central Bragg spot. In such a tiling the spacing between the rods is fixed and a random rotation around each rod determines the location of the next rod. These structures can potentially possess bandgaps due to the Mie scattering behaviour of the rods. However, these structures have a characteristic strong photon localisation. Optical modes can randomly scatter across the structure from one scattering centre (in this case the rods) to the other, eventually setting up very strong Anderson localisation. The modes set up by the localisation can possess very high Q factors (-10000).<br>
Additionally, the amorphous patterning provides no form of coherent interference in the far-field and even illumination can be seen, as shown in Figure 18. The amorphous pattern of rods is indicated by 1801. An LED structure 1802 incorporating this type of pattern gives rise to predictably uniform illumination 1803 in the far field.<br>
LEDs have numerous application, for example, traffic lights, headlights, IR emitting objects for sensing, projection and domestic lighting. The present invention provides improved LEDs for all these applications through improved efficiency and through the form of the light output.<br>
In a futher aspect of the present invention, LED structures can have etched photonic quasicrystal rods filled with a tunable material. This could be an electrically tunable material or a liquid crystal. The material will respond by<br>
altering the refractive index of the rods, changing the band structure of the photonic quasicrystal. In this arrangement the level of confinement of the light as well as the absolute wavelength can be tuned. This in turn can alter the emission properties by either preferentially emitting at a slightly different wavelength or different intensity from the LED which may possess a broad wavelength emission range. In an application where the LED is used to generate light for a projector, this can offer a means of providing different mood settings (warm colours for movies, or maximum brightness for presentations). An example of this set up is shown in Figure 19. An LED structure having an active layer 1906 emits light 1904 from its top surface at a region having a photonic quasicrystal structure 1905 as previously described. The rods of the photonic quasicrystal are filled with a material with a refractive index that can be tuned by the application of an electric field. The electric field is applied across the structure from a voltage source 1907. The emission 1904 from the structure is shown in plot 1902, which is a plot of emission versus wavelength. The dotted line indicates the emission characteristic of the active layer 1906. A small portion of the band of wavelengths is emitted from the top of the structure as a result of the photonic band structure of the photonic quasicrystal. By tuning the refractive index of the rods 1905 the emitted band of wavelengths can be selected.<br><br><br>
