ELECTRO-HYDRAULIC CONTROL SYSTEM WITH INTERLOCK PROTECTION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates to electro-hydraulic control systems for an<br>
automatically shiftable transmission.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Multi-speed vehicular transmissions, particularly those using planetary gear<br>
arrangements, require a hydraulic system to provide controlled engagement and<br>
disengagement, on a desired schedule, of the clutches and brakes or torque transmitting<br>
mechanisms that operate to establish the ratios within the planetary gear arrangement.<br>
[0003]	These control systems have evolved from substantially pure hydraulic<br>
control systems, wherein hydraulic devices produce all of the control signals to electro-<br>
hydraulic control systems, wherein an electronic control unit produces a number of the<br>
control signals. An electronic control unit emits electrical control signals to solenoid<br>
valves, which then issue controlled hydraulic signals to the various operative valves<br>
within the transmission control.<br>
[0004]	With many of the early pure hydraulic and first generation electro-hydraulic<br>
control systems, the power transmission utilized a number of freewheel or one-way<br>
devices which smooth the shifting or ratio interchange of the transmission during both<br>
upshifting and downshifting of the transmission. This relieves the hydraulic control<br>
system from providing for the control of overlap between the torque transmitting<br>
mechanism that was coming on and the torque transmitting mechanism that was going<br>
off. If this overlap is excessive, the driver feels a shudder in the drivetrain, and if the<br>
overlap is too little, the driver experiences engine flare or a sense of coasting. The<br>
freewheel device prevents this feeling by quickly engaging when the torque imposed<br>
thereon is reversed from a freewheeling state to a transmitting state.<br><br>
2<br>
[0005]	The advent of electro-hydraulic devices gave rise to what is known as clutch-<br>
to-clutch shift arrangements to reduce the complexity of the transmission and its control<br>
system. These electro-hydraulic control systems are generally perceived to reduce cost<br>
and reduce the space required for the control system.<br>
[0006]	In addition, with the advent of more sophisticated control systems, the<br>
transmissions have advanced from two-speed or three-speed transmissions to five-speed<br>
and six-speed transmissions. In at least one presently available six-speed transmission,<br>
just five friction devices are employed to provide six forward speeds, neutral condition,<br>
and a reverse speed. The torque capacity of a torque transmitting mechanism (on-<br>
coming or off-going) involved in a shift may be controlled by the combination of an<br>
electrically activated solenoid valve and a pressure regulator valve or trim valve. In a<br>
typical system, the solenoid valve is activated by pulse-width-modulation (PWM) at a<br>
controlled duty cycle to develop a pilot or control pressure for the pressure regulator<br>
valve or trim valve, which in turn, supplies fluid pressure to the torque transmitting<br>
mechanisms in proportion to the solenoid duty cycle.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007]	An electro-hydraulic control system is provided for an automatically<br>
shiftable transmission having first, second, and third selectively engageable torque<br>
transmitting mechanisms. The electro-hydraulic control system includes a main source<br>
of fluid pressure. A first, second, and third trim valve operate to effect the engagement<br>
of respective first, second, and third torque transmitting mechanisms. A latch valve is<br>
provided in fluid communication with the first torque transmitting mechanism, while an<br>
interlock valve in selective fluid communication with the latch valve. The first trim<br>
valve is in fluid communication with the main source of fluid pressure. The latch valve<br>
and the interlock valve are in fluid communication with the main source of fluid<br>
pressure. The first trim valve operates to selectively and variably communicate fluid<br>
pressure to the latch valve to effect engagement of the first torque transmitting<br><br>
3<br>
mechanism. The interlock valve is operable to selectively communicate fluid pressure<br>
to one of the second and third trim valves to effect engagement of the respective second<br>
and third torque transmitting mechanisms. The latch valve preferably includes a<br>
differential area operable maintain the latch valve in position when the first toque<br>
transmitting mechanism is engaged.<br>
[0008]	The automatically shiftable transmission may further include a fourth torque<br>
transmitting mechanism and the electro-hydraulic control system may include a fourth<br>
trim valve operable to effect the engagement of the fourth torque transmitting<br>
mechanism. The interlock valve operates to selectively communicate fluid pressure to<br>
the fourth trim valve to effect engagement of the fourth torque transmitting mechanism.<br>
In addition, the automatically shiftable transmission may also include a fifth torque<br>
transmitting mechanism and the electro-hydraulic control system may include a fifth<br>
trim valve in fluid communication with the main source of fluid pressure. The fifth<br>
trim valve is operable to effect the engagement of the fifth torque transmitting<br>
mechanism.<br>
[0009]	The interlock valve is preferably sufficiently configured to disallow fluid<br>
pressure to the second trim valve when fluid pressure is provided to the third trim<br>
valve. Alternately, the interlock valve is preferably sufficiently configured to disallow<br>
fluid pressure to the third trim valve when fluid pressure is provided to the second trim<br>
valve. The interlock valve may also be sufficiently configured to disallow fluid<br>
pressure to the second trim valve when fluid pressure is provided to the fourth and/or<br>
fifth trim valve. Alternately, the interlock valve may be sufficiently configured to<br>
disallow fluid pressure to the fourth and/or fifth trim valve when fluid pressure is<br>
provided to the second trim valve.<br>
[0010]	The above features and advantages and other features and advantages of the<br>
present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description of the best<br>
modes for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the accompanying<br>
drawings.<br><br>
4<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0011]	Figure 1 is a schematic representation of a powertrain incorporating an<br>
automatically shiftable transmission controlled by the electro-hydraulic control system of<br>
the present invention; and<br>
[0012]	Figure 2a and 2b, taken together and placed side by side, represent a<br>
schematic representation of the electro-hydraulic control system utilized by the<br>
powertrain of Figure 1 and depicting the electro-hydraulic control system in an electrical<br>
power on, neutral mode of operation.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0013]	Referring to the drawings, wherein like characters represent the same or<br>
corresponding components throughout the several figures, there is shown in Figure 1 a<br>
powertrain 10 having an a power source 12, an automatically shiftable transmission 14,<br>
and a final drive 16.<br>
[0014]	The power source 12 is preferably an engine, such as an internal combustion<br>
engine. The automatically shiftable transmission 14 includes a planetary gear<br>
arrangement having an input shaft 18, an output shaft 20, three planetary gearsets 22, 24,<br>
and 26, five torque transmitting mechanisms C1, C2, C3, C4, and C5 and an electro-<br>
hydraulic control system 28. The torque transmitting mechanisms Cl and C2 are fluid-<br>
operated rotating clutch-type devices, while the torque transmitting mechanisms C3, C4,<br>
and C5 are fluid-operated stationary clutch or brake devices. The selective engagement<br>
and disengagement of the torque transmitting mechanisms Cl, C2, C3, C4, and C5 is<br>
controlled by the electro-hydraulic control system 28, the details of which is shown in<br>
Figures 2a and 2b. A fluid coupler or torque converter 30 is provided between an output<br>
shaft 31 of the power source 12 and the input shaft 18 of the automatically shiftable<br>
transmission 14. A lockup clutch 32 is provided to substantially lock the output shaft 31<br>
and the input shaft 18 for unitary rotation, thereby bypassing the torque converter 30 to<br>
increase the operating efficiency of the powertrain 10 under certain operating conditions.<br><br>
5<br>
[0015]	An electronic control unit, or ECU 34, provides control signals to the electro-<br>
hydraulic control system 28. The ECU 34 receives a number of electrical signals from<br>
the vehicle, power source 12, and automatically shiftable transmission 14, such as engine<br>
speed, throttle angle, vehicle speed, to name a few. These electrical signals are used as<br>
input signals for a programmable digital computer, which is incorporated within the ECU<br>
34. The ECU 34 is then effective to distribute the control signals as required to enable<br>
the operation of the automatically shiftable transmission 14 in a controlled manner.<br>
[0016]	The planetary gear arrangement, as shown in Figure 1, provides four forward<br>
speed ratios or ranges between the input shaft 18 and the output shaft 20. In the first<br>
forward range, the torque transmitting mechanisms Cl and C5 are engaged. In the<br>
second forward range, the torque transmitting mechanisms Cl and C4 are engaged. In<br>
the third forward range, the torque transmitting mechanisms Cl and C3 are engaged. In<br>
the fourth forward range, the torque transmitting mechanisms Cl and C2 are engaged.<br>
The gearing also provides a neutral condition when the torque transmitting mechanisms<br>
Cl, C2, C3, C4, and C5 are disengaged. Additionally, a first reverse range is provided<br>
wherein the torque transmitting mechanisms C2 and C5 are engaged. A second reverse<br>
range is provided wherein the torque transmitting mechanisms C2 and C4 are engaged.<br>
[0017]	The powertrain 10 has two speed ranges of drive-home capabilities within the<br>
electrically variable hybrid transmission 14 in the event that the electro-hydraulic<br>
control system 28 undergoes a malfunction or discontinuance of electrical power. In the<br>
electrical power off drive home modes, the electro-hydraulic control system 28 defaults<br>
to a neutral mode of operation wherein the torque transmitting mechanism C3 is engaged,<br>
and a forward mode of operation wherein the torque transmitting mechanisms C1 and C3<br>
are engaged, such as the third forward range.<br>
[0018]	As shown in Figures 2a and 2b, the electro-hydraulic control system 28<br>
includes a main source of fluid pressure 36 such as from a hydraulic pump, not shown.<br>
The main source of fluid pressure 36 operates to pressurize a main passage 38. The main<br>
passage 38 is in fluid communication with control regulator valve 40, a lockup clutch<br>
trim valve 42, a trim valve 44, a trim valve 46, a trim valve 48, a trim valve 50, a trim<br><br>
6<br>
valve 52, and a C1 latch valve 54. Additionally, a plurality exhaust passage, each labeled<br>
as "EX" in Figures 2a and 2b, operate to depressurize or exhaust fluid pressure.<br>
[0019]	The control regulator valve 40 operates to reduce the fluid pressure within the<br>
main passage 38 to a control pressure within a control passage 56. The fluid within the<br>
control passage 56 is communicated to a plurality of solenoid valves 58, 60, 62, 64, 66,<br>
68, and 70. The solenoid valve 70 is an on/off type solenoid valve, while the solenoid<br>
valves 58, 60, 62, 64, 66, and 68 are variable pressure type solenoid valves. The solenoid<br>
valve 58 and 62 are normally high or normally open type solenoid valve, while the<br>
remaining solenoid valves 60, 64, 66, and 68 are normally low or normally closed type<br>
solenoid valves. As is known to those skilled in the art, a normally open solenoid valve<br>
will distribute output pressure in the absence of a command signal to the solenoid valve.<br>
[0020]	The solenoid valve 58 is operable to provide an output pressure in a passage<br>
72 that controls the bias pressure on the trim valve 44. The solenoid valve 60 is operable<br>
to provide an output pressure in passage 74 that controls the pressure bias on the trim<br>
valve 46. The solenoid valve 62 is operable to provide an output pressure in a passage 76<br>
that controls the pressure bias on the trim valve 48. The solenoid valve 64 is operable to<br>
provide an output pressure in a passage 78 that controls the pressure bias on the trim<br>
valve 50. Additionally, the solenoid valve 66 is operable to provide an output pressure in<br>
a passage 80 that controls the pressure bias on the trim valve 52. The trim valves 44, 46,<br>
48, 50 and 52 are selectively biased into a second position or a pressure set position by<br>
fluid pressure within their respective passages 72, 74, 76, 78 and 80. When the passages<br>
72, 74, 76, 78 and 80 are exhausted or depressurized, via the respective solenoid valves<br>
58, 60, 62, 64, and 66, their respective trim valves 44, 46, 48, 50 and 52 will move to a<br>
first position or a spring set position. Additionally, the trim valves 44, 46, 48, 50 and 52<br>
each have a trim or pressure regulation position for smooth torque transmitting<br>
mechanism engagement. Accumulator valves 82, 84, 86, 88, and 90 are provided in fluid<br>
communication with a respective passage 72, 74, 76, 78 and 80. The accumulator valves<br>
82, 84, 86, 88, and 90 operate to control torque transmitting mechanism engagement by<br>
damping fluid pressure fluctuations within the passages 72, 74, 76, 78 and 80.<br><br>
7<br>
[0021]	The solenoid valve 68 is operable to provide an output pressure in passage 92<br>
that controls the bias pressure or control pressure on the lockup clutch trim valve 42. The<br>
lockup clutch trim valve 42 has a pressure set position, a spring set position, as shown in<br>
Figure 2b, and a trim or regulation position. The lockup clutch trim valve 42 operates to<br>
selectively engage the lockup clutch 32 to increase the operating efficiency of the<br>
powertrain 10, shown in Figure 1, under certain operating conditions. To engage the<br>
lockup clutch 32, the lockup clutch trim valve 42 selectively and variably communicates<br>
fluid pressure from the main passage 38 to the lockup clutch 32 through the outlet<br>
passage 93. Additionally, the outlet passage 93 provides feedback to control the trim<br>
valve 42 when in the trim or regulation position.<br>
[0022]	The solenoid valve 70 is operable to provide an output pressure in passage 94<br>
that controls the pressure bias on the Cl latch valve 54 and an interlock valve 96. The C1<br>
latch valve 54 and the interlock valve 96 each have a pressure set position and a spring<br>
set position, as shown in Figure 2a. The Cl latch valve 54 has a differential area 98<br>
operable to latch the Cl latch valve 54 in the pressure set position. When fluid pressure<br>
is present within an outlet passage 100, the differential area 98 is provided with the force<br>
necessary to bias the Cl latch valve 54 in the pressure set position. The trim valve 44<br>
selectively communicates fluid to the Cl latch valve through the outlet passage 100. A<br>
passage 102 fluidly interconnects the Cl latch valve 54 with the interlock valve 96. The<br>
interlock valve 96 selectively communicates fluid pressure to the trim valve 46 through<br>
passage 104. Additionally, the interlock valve 96 selectively communicates fluid<br>
pressure to trim valves 50 and 52 through passage 106.<br>
[0023]	A first pressure switch 108 is provided in selective fluid communication with<br>
the Cl latch valve 54 and operates to signal the position of the Cl latch valve 54 for<br>
diagnostic purposes. Similarly, a second pressure switch 110 is provided in selective<br>
fluid communication with the interlock valve 96 and operates to signal the position of the<br>
interlock valve 96 for diagnostic purposes. In operation with Cl latch valve 54 and the<br>
interlock valve 96 in the spring set position, as shown in Figure 2a, the first and second<br>
pressure switches 108 and 110 will exhaust. When the Cl latch valve 54 is in the<br>
pressure set position, a land 112 will disallow or block any further exhausting of the first<br><br>
8<br>
pressure switch 108 and allow fluid pressure within the control passage 56 to<br>
communicate with the first pressure switch 108 thereby indicating that the Cl latch valve<br>
54 is in the pressure set position. When the interlock valve 96 is in the pressure set<br>
position, a land 114 will disallow any further exhausting of the second pressure switch<br>
110 and allow fluid pressure within the control passage 56 to communicate with the<br>
second pressure switch 110 thereby indicating that the interlock valve 96 is in the<br>
pressure set position.<br>
[0024]	The Cl latch valve 54 cooperates with the trim valve 44 to control the<br>
engagement of the torque transmitting mechanism Cl through the outlet passage 100.<br>
The trim valve 46 operates to control the engagement of the torque transmitting<br>
mechanism C2 through the outlet passage 116. The trim valve 48 operates to control the<br>
engagement of the torque transmitting mechanism C3 through the outlet passage 118.<br>
The trim valve 50 operates to control the engagement of the torque transmitting<br>
mechanism C4 through the outlet passage 120. Similarly, the trim valve 52 operates to<br>
control the engagement of the torque transmitting mechanism C5 through the outlet<br>
passage 122. Each of the outlet passages 100, 116, 118, 120, and 122 provide feedback<br>
to control the respective trim valve 44, 46, 48, 50, and 52 when in the trim or regulation<br>
position.<br>
Neutral Mode of Operation<br>
[0025]	When the neutral mode of operation, as shown in Figures 2a and 2b, is<br>
requested by the ECU 34 the Cl latch valve 54 and the interlock valve 96 are placed in<br>
the spring set position. Additionally, each of the trim valves 44, 46, 48, 50, and 52 are<br>
placed in the spring set position. In the neutral mode of operation, the torque transmitting<br>
mechanisms Cl, C2, C3, C4, and C5 are disengaged. The torque transmitting mechanism<br>
Cl will exhaust through the Cl latch valve 54. The torque transmitting mechanism C2<br>
will exhaust through the trim valve 46. The torque transmitting mechanism C3 will<br>
exhaust through the trim valve 48. The torque transmitting mechanism C4 will exhaust<br>
through the trim valve 50. Additionally, the torque transmitting mechanism C5 will<br>
exhaust through the trim valve 52.<br><br>
9<br>
First Reverse Range Mode of Operation<br>
[0026]	When the first reverse range mode of operation is requested by the ECU 34,<br>
the Cl latch valve 54 and the interlock valve 96 are placed in the spring set position.<br>
Additionally, each of the trim valves 44, 48 and 50 are placed in the spring set position,<br>
while the trim valves 46 and 52 are biased into the trim position by the respective<br>
solenoid valve 60 and 66. In the first reverse range mode of operation, the torque<br>
transmitting mechanisms Cl, C3, and C4 are disengaged, while the torque transmitting<br>
mechanisms C2 and C5 are engaged. The torque transmitting mechanism Cl will<br>
exhaust through the Cl latch valve 54. The torque transmitting mechanism C3 will<br>
exhaust through the trim valve 48. Additionally, the torque transmitting mechanism C4<br>
will exhaust through the trim valve 50.<br>
[0027]	The engagement of the torque transmitting mechanism C2 is controlled via the<br>
trim valve 46. With the interlock valve 96 in the spring set position, fluid pressure within<br>
the main pressure passage 38 is communicated to the passage 104 for subsequent<br>
communication to the trim valve 46. With the trim valve 46 in the trim position, fluid<br>
pressure within the passage 104 is selectively and variably communicated to the outlet<br>
passage 116 to effect engagement of the torque transmitting mechanism C2. The<br>
engagement of the torque transmitting mechanism C5 is controlled via the trim valve 52.<br>
With the Cl latch valve 54 and the interlock valve 96 in the spring set position, fluid<br>
pressure within the main pressure passage 38 is communicated from the Cl latch valve<br>
54 to the interlock valve 96 via passage 102. Fluid pressure is subsequently<br>
communicated from the interlock valve 96 to the passage 106 for subsequent<br>
communication to the trim valve 52. With the trim valve 52 in the trim position, fluid<br>
pressure within the passage 106 is selectively and variably communicated to the outlet<br>
passage 122 to effect engagement of the torque transmitting mechanism C5.<br>
Second Reverse Range Mode of Operation<br>
[0028]	When the second reverse range mode of operation is requested by the ECU<br>
34, the Cl latch valve 54 and the interlock valve 96 are placed in the spring set position.<br>
Additionally, each of the trim valves 44, 48 and 52 are placed in the spring set position,<br>
while the trim valves 46 and 50 are biased into the trim position by the respective<br><br>
10<br>
solenoid valve 60 and 64. In the second reverse range mode of operation, the torque<br>
transmitting mechanisms Cl, C3, and C5 are disengaged, while the torque transmitting<br>
mechanisms C2 and C4 are engaged. The torque transmitting mechanism Cl will<br>
exhaust through the Cl latch valve 54. The torque transmitting mechanism C3 will<br>
exhaust through the trim valve 48. Additionally, the torque transmitting mechanism C5<br>
will exhaust through the trim valve 52.<br>
[0029]	The engagement of the torque transmitting mechanism C2 is controlled via the<br>
trim valve 46. With the interlock valve 96 in the spring set position, fluid pressure within<br>
the main pressure passage 38 is communicated to the passage 104 for subsequent<br>
communication to the trim valve 46. With the trim valve 46 in the trim position, fluid<br>
pressure within the passage 104 is selectively and variably communicated to the outlet<br>
passage 116 to effect engagement of the torque transmitting mechanism C2. The<br>
engagement of the torque transmitting mechanism C4 is controlled via the trim valve 50.<br>

valve 52 in the trim position, fluid pressure within the passage 106 is selectively and<br>
variably communicated to the outlet passage 122 to effect engagement of the torque<br>
transmitting mechanism C5.<br>

34, the Cl latch valve 54 and the interlock valve 96 are biased into the pressure set<br>
position by the solenoid valve 70. Additionally, each of the trim valves 46, 48, and 52<br>

pressure from within the main pressure passage 38 to the outlet passage 100 for<br>
subsequent communication to the Cl latch valve 54. With the Cl latch valve 54 in the<br>
pressure set position, the fluid pressure within the outlet passage 100 is communicated to<br>

by the solenoid valve 70. Additionally, each of the trim valves 46, 50, and 52 are placed<br>
in the spring set position, while the trim valves 44 and 48 are biased into the trim position<br>
by the respective solenoid valve 58 and 62. In the third forward range mode of operation,<br>

pressure from within the main pressure passage 38 to the outlet passage 100 for<br>
subsequent communication to the Cl latch valve 54. With the Cl latch valve 54 in the<br><br>
13<br>
pressure set position, the fluid pressure within the outlet passage 100 is communicated to<br>
the torque transmitting mechanism Cl to effect engagement. Additionally, it should be<br>
understood that the fluid pressure acting on the differential area 98 when the torque<br>
transmitting mechanism Cl is engaged will maintain the Cl latch valve 54 in the pressure<br>
set position. The engagement of the torque transmitting mechanism C3 is controlled via<br>
the trim valve 48. With the trim valve 48 in the trim position, fluid pressure within the<br>
main pressure passage 38 is selectively and variably communicated to the outlet passage<br>
118 to effect engagement of the torque transmitting mechanism C3.<br>
[0036]	When an alternate third forward range mode of operation is requested, the C1<br>
latch valve 54 is latched in the pressure set position by the fluid pressure within the toque<br>
transmitting mechanism Cl engaging the differential area 98. The interlock valve 96 is<br>
placed in the spring set position as a result of the solenoid valve 70 exhausting fluid<br>
pressure from the passage 94.<br>
Fourth Forward Range Mode of Operation<br>
[0037]	When the third forward range mode of operation is requested by the ECU 34,<br>
the Cl latch valve 54 is latched in the pressure set position by the fluid pressure within<br>
the toque transmitting mechanism Cl engaging the differential area 98. The interlock<br>
valve 96 is placed in the spring set position as a result of the solenoid valve 70 exhausting<br>
fluid pressure from the passage 94. Additionally, each of the trim valves 48, 50, and 52<br>
are placed in the spring set position, while the trim valves 44 and 46 are biased into the<br>

pressure from within the main pressure passage 38 to the outlet passage 100 for<br>
subsequent communication to the Cl latch valve 54. With the Cl latch valve 54 latched<br><br>
14<br>
in the pressure set position, the fluid pressure within the outlet passage 100 is<br>
communicated to the torque transmitting mechanism Cl to effect engagement. The<br>
engagement of the torque transmitting mechanism C2 is controlled via the trim valve 46.<br>
With the interlock valve 96 in the spring set position, fluid pressure within the main<br>
pressure passage 38 is communicated to the passage 104 for subsequent communication<br>
to the trim valve 46. With the trim valve 46 in the trim position, fluid pressure within the<br>
passage 104 is selectively and variably communicated to the outlet passage 116 to effect<br>
engagement of the torque transmitting mechanism C2.<br>
First Power OFF Drive Home Mode of Operation<br>
[0039]	If there is an interruption of electrical power to the electro-hydraulic control<br>
system 28 and the automatically shiftable transmission 14 is operating in the first or<br>
second reverse range or the neutral mode of operation, the electro-hydraulic control<br>
system 28 will default to the first power OFF drive home mode of operation. In this<br>
mode, the Cl latch valve 54 and the interlock valve 96 are in the spring set position since<br>
the solenoid valve 70 is a normally closed type valve.<br>
[0040]	The trim valves 44 and 48 will move to the pressure set position since their<br>
respective solenoid valves 58 and 62 are normally open type valves. The trim valves<br>
46, 50, and 52 will move to the spring set position since their respective solenoid<br>
valves 60, 64, and 66 are normally closed type valves. In the first power OFF drive<br>
home mode of operation, the torque transmitting mechanisms Cl, C2, C4, and C5 are<br>
disengaged, while the torque transmitting mechanism C3 is engaged. The torque<br>
transmitting mechanism Cl will exhaust through the Cl latch valve 54. The torque<br>
transmitting mechanism C2 will exhaust through the trim valve 46. The torque<br>
transmitting mechanism C4 will exhaust through the trim valve 50. Additionally, the<br>
torque transmitting mechanism C5 will exhaust through the trim valve 52.<br>
[0041]	The engagement of the torque transmitting mechanism C3 is controlled via the<br>
trim valve 48. With the trim valve 48 in the pressure set position, fluid pressure within<br>
the main pressure passage 38 is communicated to the outlet passage 118 to effect<br>
engagement of the torque transmitting mechanism C3.<br><br>
15<br>
Second Power OFF Drive Home Mode of Operation<br>
[0042]	If there is an interruption of electrical power to the electro-hydraulic control<br>
system 28 and the automatically shiftable transmission 14 is operating in the first, second,<br>
third, or fourth forward range mode of operation, the electro-hydraulic control system 28<br>
will default to the second power OFF drive home mode of operation. In this mode, the<br>
Cl latch valve 54 is latched in the pressure set position by the fluid pressure within the<br>
toque transmitting mechanism Cl engaging the differential area 98. The interlock valve<br>
96 is placed in the spring set position as a result of the solenoid valve 70 exhausting fluid<br>
pressure from the passage 94 since the solenoid valve 70 is a normally closed type<br>
valve.<br>
[0043]	The trim valves 44 and 48 will move to the pressure set position since their<br>
respective solenoid valves 58 and 62 are normally open type valves. The trim valves<br>
46, 50, and 52 will move to the spring set position since their respective solenoid<br>
valves 60, 64, and 66 are normally closed type valves. In the second power OFF drive<br>
home mode of operation, the torque transmitting mechanisms C2, C4, and C5 are<br>
disengaged, while the torque transmitting mechanisms Cl and C3 are engaged. The<br>
torque transmitting mechanism C2 will exhaust through the trim valve 46. The torque<br>
transmitting mechanism C4 will exhaust through the trim valve 50. Additionally, the<br>
torque transmitting mechanism C5 will exhaust through the trim valve 52.<br>
[0044]	The engagement of the torque transmitting mechanism Cl is controlled via the<br>
trim valve 44. The trim valve 44 operates to communicate fluid pressure from within the<br>
main pressure passage 38 to the outlet passage 100 for subsequent communication to the<br>
Cl latch valve 54. With the Cl latch valve 54 latched in the pressure set position, the<br>
fluid pressure within the outlet passage 100 is communicated to the torque transmitting<br>
mechanism Cl to effect engagement. The engagement of the torque transmitting<br>
mechanism C3 is controlled via the trim valve 48. With the trim valve 48 in the pressure<br>
set position, fluid pressure within the main pressure passage 38 is communicated to the<br>
outlet passage 118 to effect engagement of the torque transmitting mechanism C3. In<br><br>
16<br>
effect, the automatically shiftable transmission 14 will provide a gear ratio equivalent to<br>
the third forward range mode of operation.<br>
[0045]	The Cl latch valve 54 and the interlock valve 96 cooperate to selectively lock<br>
out torque transmitting mechanisms to avoid unintentional engagement in various modes<br>
of operation. For instance, when operating in the first, second, or third forward range of<br>
operation, the engagement of the torque transmitting mechanism C2 will be disallowed.<br>
To lock out the torque transmitting mechanism C2, the passage 104, which communicates<br>
with the interlock valve 96, is exhausted though passage 102 via the Cl latch valve. This<br>
is possible since the Cl latch valve 54 and the interlock valve 96 are placed in the<br>
pressure set position by the solenoid valve 70. With the passage 104 exhausted, the trim<br>
valve 46 is unable to effect the engagement of the torque transmitting mechanism C2<br>
should the trim valve 46 stick in the trim or pressure set position or the solenoid valve 60<br>
inadvertently energize.<br>
[0046]	Additionally, when operating in the third or fourth forward range of operation,<br>
the engagement of the torque transmitting mechanism C4 and C5 will be disallowed. To<br>
lock out the torque transmitting mechanism C4 and C5, the passage 106, which<br>
communicates with the interlock valve 96, is exhausted though passage 102 via the Cl<br>
latch valve. This is possible since the Cl latch valve 54 is latched in the pressure set<br>
position by the fluid pressure within the torque transmitting mechanism Cl acting on the<br>
differential area 98 and the interlock valve 96 are placed in spring set position by the<br>
solenoid valve 70.<br>
