				<td>NOVEL SUSTAINED RELEASE PHARMACEUTICAL<br>
COMPOUNDS TO PREVENT ABUSE OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
(i) Field of the Invention<br>
[001]	The present invention relates to novel pharmaceutical compounds and<br>
more particularly to controlled substances that are covalently bound to a chemical<br>
moiety and thus rendered pharmaceutically inactive until broken down by<br>
enzymatic and/or chemical means in a time-dependent manner following oral<br>
administration. Delayed release from the conjugate prevents spiking of drug levels<br>
and affords gradual release over an extended period of time. The enzymatic and/or<br>
chemical conditions necessary for the release of the controlled substance are either<br>
not present or of minimal activity when the novel pharmaceutical compound is<br>
introduced nasally, inhaled, or injected; thus, also preventing spiking when<br>
administered by these routes. Controlled substances with these novel properties are<br>
less likely to be abused due to the diminished "rush" effect of the modified<br>
controlled substance. Consequently, the therapeutic value of these pharmaceuticals<br>
is enhanced by decreasing euphoria while increasing the duration of the analgesic<br>
effect.<br>
(ii) Description of the Related Art<br>
[002]	A number of pharmacologically useful compounds are also<br>
commonly abused controlled substances. In particular, analgesics that are prescribed<br>
for the management of acute and chronic pain have become increasingly abused<br>
over the last decades. For example, the increase in prescription of oxycodone in the<br>
last few years led to widespread abuse of this drug. Amphetamines are another<br>
example of controlled substances with important pharmacological uses that are<br>
highly addictive and commonly abused.<br>
[003]	There is considerable information readily available to individuals<br>
which teaches how to derive purified forms of controlled substances from<br><br>
prescription products. These techniques are both simple and well described on<br>
multiple websites. Most of these procedures utilize cold water, although, hot water,<br>
changes in pH and other solvents are described. Examples of these procedures are<br>
described below.<br>
[004]	The description of these procedures was found on the web in<br>
February of 2003 at http://codeine.50g.eom/info/extraction.html#ex.coldw and is<br>
paraphrased below. Cold water extraction is used to extract an opiate/opioid<br>
substance from combination tablets. This method subverts the fact that opiates are<br>
generally very soluble in cold water, while paracetamol, aspirin, and ibuprofen are<br>
only very slightly soluble. These techniques are sophisticated enough to recognize<br>
that pseudoephedrine and caffeine are water soluble and will remain in the solution<br>
and that dispersible tablets make it difficult to extract secondary substances. The<br>
description of the equipment required makes it clear that these procedures make<br>
abuse readily available. The equipment includes a minimum two glasses or cups,<br>
paper filters (unbleached coffee filters will do) and a measure glass. Portions of the<br>
procedures are provided below:<br>
1.	Crush the tablets and dissolve in cold (20° C) water.<br>
2.	Cool the solution down to approximately 5° C stirring occasionally.<br>
3.	Leave the solution in a cool place for about 20 minutes.<br>
4.	Wet the filter(s) with very cold water to prevent it from absorbing the<br>
solution and put it in the glass. Stick an elastic/rubber band around<br>
the container to keep the filter in place.<br>
5.	Pour the solution through the filter to filter out the secondary<br>
substance from codeine.<br>
6.	Discard used filters with secondary substance solids left.<br>
[005]	However, when these procedures were viewed as not providing<br>
sufficient yields improved method were designed for extracting codeine which<br>
simply require the addition of chloroform or like solvent such as methylene chloride.<br>
This technique utilizes methods which alter the pH aspects of the solution to<br>
improve extraction and even provides instruction on how to re-salt the product.<br>
Portions of the procedure are described below.<br><br>
1.	Place uncrushed T3's or other APAP/codeine product in a small<br>
glass or beaker and cover with enough distilled water so that the<br>
pills will break down into a thin paste.<br>
2.	Add dry sodium carbonate to reduce the codeine phosphate to<br>
codeine base. The pH of the mixture should be about 11 or greater.<br>
3.	Pour the mixture into the pyrex pan and rinse the beaker with a<br>
few ml of distilled water and add the rinse water to the mix in a<br>
pan.<br>
4.	Wrap the dried material in a coffee filter and grind the stuff<br>
5.	Pour the dry crushed mixture into a glass bottle with a screw-on<br>
top and pour in enough chloroform to completely cover.<br>
6.	Shake and filter.<br>
[006]	While there has been considerable effort to provide controlled<br>
substances which are resistance to abuse current products fail to achieve the stability<br>
required to prevent abuse. The present invention however, provides methods and<br>
compositions which retain their stability even when subjected to current abuse<br>
methods, and therefore provide a much needed but less addictive and/or less likely<br>
to be abused product.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[007]	Thus, there is clearly a need in the art for a more "street-safe" version<br>
of controlled substances, which will permit one to obtain the therapeutically<br>
beneficial effects of these substances on the one hand while avoiding the euphoric<br>
effects that lead to substance abuse on the other hand. It is, therefore, a primary<br>
object of the present invention to fulfill this need by providing controlled substances<br>
that have been chemically modified to be released only under selected conditions<br>
and, even then, only at a controlled rate that does not give rise to a euphoric effect.<br>
[008]	More particularly, it is an object of the present invention to provide<br>
chemically modified controlled release substances that are themselves inactive and<br>
resistant to absorption until broken down by chemical or enzymatic means at the<br>
desired target location, such as for example under the acidic conditions of the<br>
stomach and/or the enzymatic activity present in the gastrointestinal tract.<br><br>
[009]	It is another object of the invention to provide chemically modified<br>
controlled release substances that are released only in the blood serum, again at<br>
controlled release rates that do not give rise to a euphoric effect.<br>
[010]	In a first aspect, the present invention comprises a controlled<br>
substance that has been rendered inactive or substantially inactive comprising said<br>
controlled substance covalently bonded to a chemical moiety comprising an amino<br>
acid or more preferably an oligopeptide. The oligopeptide preferably less than 50<br>
and more preferably less than 6 amino acids.<br>
[011]	In a second aspect, the present invention comprises a controlled<br>
substance that has been rendered inactive or substantially inactive comprising said<br>
controlled substance covalently bonded to a chemical moiety comprising an amino<br>
acid or more preferably an oligopeptide which breaks down under the acid<br>
conditions of the stomach and/or the enzymatic activity present in the<br>
gastrointestinal tract.<br>
[012]	In the oral composition define above, absorption of the controlled<br>
substance into the bloodstream upon oral delivery occurs in a sustained release<br>
manner and peak concentrations of the drug are decreased as compared to non-<br>
conjugated drug given in a similar dosage and formulation. Sustained release may<br>
further be defined as release of the active agent into systemic blood circulation over<br>
a prolonged period of time relative to the release of the active agent in conventional<br>
formulations through similar delivery routes.<br>
[013]	In a third aspect, the present invention relates to a method for<br>
delivering a controlled substance to a patient so as to obtain a therapeutic, but not a<br>
substantial euphoric effect, comprising orally administering the above composition<br>
to the patient.<br><br>
[014]	In a fourth aspect, the present invention relates to a method for<br>
delivering a controlled substance to a patient so as to obtain a therapeutic, but not a<br>
substantial euphoric effect, comprising parenterally administering the above<br>
composition to the patient.<br>
[015]	The invention is further illustrated by drawings (figures) and tables of<br>
data. The following is a list of illustrations describing the invention in detail.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[032]	The present invention provides methods for altering controlled<br>
substances in a manner that decreases their potential for abuse. The novel<br>
compounds may be combined in tablets with suitable excipients or formulated in<br>
solution for oral delivery. When delivered by the oral route the controlled substance<br>
is released in a time-dependent manner (sustained release) by acid hydrolysis and/or<br>
enzymatic cleavage. When administered by injection the controlled substance is<br>
released in a time-dependent manner (sustained release) by way of serum enzymes.<br>
[033]	Throughout this application the use of "peptide" is meant to include a<br>
single amino acid, a dipeptide, a tripeptide, an oligopeptide, a polypeptide, or the<br>
carrier peptide. Oligopeptide is meant to include from 2 amino acids to 70 amino<br>
acids. Further, at times the invention is described as being an active agent attached<br>
to an amino acid, a dipeptide, a tripeptide, an oligopeptide, or polypeptide to<br>
illustrate specific embodiments for the active agent conjugate. Preferred lengths of<br>
the conjugates and other preferred embodiments are described herein. In another<br>
embodiment the number of amino acids is selected from 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 amino<br>
acids. In another embodiment of the invention the molecular weight of the carrier<br>
portion of the conjugate is below about 2,500, more preferably below about 1,000<br>
and most preferably below about 500.<br>
Terms defined<br>
[034]	Controlled substance - a substance subject to federal regulation of its<br>
manufacture, sale, or distribution because of the potential for, or proved evidence of,<br>
abuse; because of its potential for psychic or physiological dependence; because it<br>
constitutes a public health risk; because of the scientific evidence of its<br>
pharmacologic effect; or because of its role as a precursor of other controlled<br>
substances.<br><br>
[035]	Chemical moiety - a substance made up of chemical elements and<br>
characterized by a defined molecular composition. It can exist as a part of the drug<br>
conjugate and can be separated from the conjugate. Examples include an amino<br>
acid, an oligopeptide or a polypeptide, but may be any number of other substances.<br>
[036]	Although the discussion which follows focuses on oral administration<br>
of the controlled substance, it will be appreciated that the compositions and methods<br>
of the present invention are likewise applicable to injectable administration of the<br>
controlled substance.<br>
[037]	Covalent attachment of a chemical moiety to a controlled substance<br>
can render the substance pharmacologically inactive and resistant to absorption.<br>
Removal of the chemical moiety by enzymatic or chemical means, however, can<br>
restore the activity and the ability to be absorbed. The acidic conditions of the<br>
stomach and/or the enzymatic activity present in the gastrointestinal tract can<br>
therefore affect release of the active controlled substance. Provided release does not<br>
occur too rapidly, the pharmacologically active agent will be absorbed into the<br>
bloodstream by a time-release mechanism following oral administration.<br>
[038]	One aim of the invention is to decrease potential for abuse by<br>
establishing oral extended release via covalent modification. Although this would<br>
theoretically decrease the potential for abuse, ideally it would probably only<br>
decrease the potential by approximately half for oral administration. For example,<br>
equal AUC with a blunted curve (Cmax - 50%) would only decrease the oral abuse<br>
potential by half (i.e. two anti-abuse pills would presumably induce approximately<br>
the same euphoric effect as one control pill). The DEA reports that abuse started<br>
with oral administration ultimately leads to intranasal or intravenous abuse due to<br>
tolerance. Once tolerance is established the rush effect sought requires the intranasal<br>
or intravenous route.<br>
[039]	When abused, controlled substances are typically delivered by means<br>
other than the oral route, namely by: i) parenteral injection; ii) intranasal delivery; or<br>
iii) inhalation. Administration by these routes results in rapid absorption into the<br><br>
bloodstream and the subsequent "rush" effect sought by the addict. It follows that<br>
an opoid conjugate that produces a significantly diminished euphoric effect when<br>
given by IN or IV, as compared in relative terms to its analgesic effect by oral<br>
administration, is valuable in diminishing its potential for abuse. Thus when given<br>
by these routes, the covalently modified compound of the invention (adopted for<br>
breakdown in the stomach or intestinal tract) is: i) not exposed to the necessary<br>
chemical and/or enzymatic conditions necessary for release of the active agent; or ii)<br>
the required activity is not present in sufficient amounts to affect rapid<br>
release/absorption. The covalently modified controlled substance, therefore, does not<br>
produce me euphoric effect sought by addicts.<br>
[040]	While other aspects of the invention, eg. sustained release etc.<br>
provide additional benefits to patients a preferred aspect of the invention is the<br>
design of an opoid conjugate product that has a reasonable shelf life (shelf safe)<br>
which can not be abused through current practices. It is a preferred embodiment of<br>
the invention, however, that the opoid conjugate not release the opoid through<br>
chemical action prior to administration.<br>
[041]	There are a number of mechanisms by which the potential for abuse<br>
of an analgesic may be decreased, including:<br>
1.	Decrease efficiency of the drugs ability to cross the IN barrier.<br>
2.	Decrease efficiency of the drugs ability to cross the blood brain<br>
barrier.<br>
note: 1 and 2 are likely correlated.<br>
3.	Increase in the half-life of a conjugate once it reaches the CSF<br>
(provided the conjugate is still effective as an analgesic.<br>
note: requires the drug-conjugate reaching the CSF.<br>
4. Decreased conversion of the opoid conjugate to a more active<br>
metaboloite (e.g. codeine to morphine conversion).<br>
In the case of opoids it may not be necessary (or even desirable) to have all drug<br>
release occur in the intestine. If some, or all, of the drug enters as a conjugate it is<br>
still a valuable therapeutic agent provided it can still reach the CSF and has an<br>
analgesic effect. In this regard "extended release" (more accurately extended<br>
analgesia) may be achieved post absorption. This might be accomplished by: 1)<br>
extended serum half-life 2) extended CSF half-life 3) temporal absorption across the<br><br>
blood brain barrier (provided it is eventually converted to parent drug and does not<br>
have an adverse effect of its own).<br>
[042]	The invention may be comprised of any controlled substance<br>
covalently attached to any chemical moiety, such as narcotics. Preferably, the<br>
controlled substance is an analgesic or stimulant. Further, the controlled substance is<br>
preferably of the group of analgesics comprised of the following: codeine, fentanyl,<br>
hydrocodone, hydromorphone, levorphanol, methadone, oxymorphone, morphine,<br>
oxycodone, propoxyphene, and sufentanyl. The controlled substance may also be<br>
amphetamine or methylphenidate. Examples of other controlled drugs include<br>
barbiturates, benzodiazepines, skeletal muscle relaxants e.g. meprobamate, and<br>
stimulants including amphetamine, methamphetamine, methylphenidate, pemoline,<br>
etc.<br>
[043]	In a preferred embodiment the invention provides a carrier and active<br>
agent which are bound to each other but otherwise unmodified in structure. This<br>
embodiment may further be described as the carrier having a free carboxy and/or<br>
amine terminal and/or side chain groups other than the location of attachment for the<br>
active agent. In a more preferred embodiment the carrier, whether a single amino<br>
acid, dipeptide, tripeptide, oligopeptide or polypeptide is comprised only naturally<br>
occurring amino acids.<br>
[044]	The chemical moiety comprising the invention may be any chemical<br>
substance that can be attached to the controlled substance in a manner that renders it<br>
pharmacologically inactive. Analgesics and stimulants produce their<br>
pharmacological effects through binding to specific receptors or uptake proteins.<br>
The attachment of certain chemical moieties can therefore prevent the active<br>
substance from binding its receptor(s) or recognition site on its uptake protein.<br>
Further, without being bound by theory, the covalent modification is believed to<br>
prevent the pharmacological effect by preventing the drug from crossing the blood-<br>
brain barrier. Preferably, the attachment of the chemical moiety to the controlled<br>
substance will also prevent or substantially delay the absorption of the compound,<br>
particularly when the compound is delivered by routes other than oral<br>
administration.<br><br>
[045]	Preferably, the attached chemical moiety is an amino acid or more<br>
preferably an oligopeptide. The oligopeptide preferably comprises less than 50<br>
amino acids and more preferably less than 6 amino acids. The oligopeptide may<br>
comprise (i) a homopolymer of one of the twenty naturally occurring amino acids,<br>
(ii) a heteropolymer of two or more naturally occurring amino acids, (iii) a<br>
homopolymer of synthetic amino acids or (iv) a heteropolymer of two or more<br>
synthetic amino acids or (v) a heteropolymer of one or more naturally occurring<br>
amino acids and one or more synthetic amino acids.<br>
[046]	The attached chemical moiety may be comprised of other naturally<br>
occurring or synthetic substances. Controlled substances, for example, could also be<br>
attached to lipids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, or vitamins. These chemical<br>
moieties could be expected to serve the same functions as a polypeptide; namely,<br>
effect delayed release in the gastrointestinal tract and prevent rapid absorption of the<br>
active agent.<br>
[047]	In one embodiment, the covalently attached chemical moiety is<br>
removed by the acidic content of the stomach if the controlled substance is attached<br>
through an acid labile bond. More preferably, the covalently attached chemical<br>
moiety can be removed by enzymatic activity encountered by the compound in the<br>
stomach and/or intestinal tract. The stomach and intestinal tract are bathed in<br>
degradative enzymes. For example, the pancreas releases into the small intestine a<br>
myriad of hydrolytic enzymes such as proteases, lipases, and amylases, and<br>
nucleases. Additionally, the intestinal epithelial cells that line the surface of the GI<br>
tract produce various surface associated and intracellular degradative enzymes (e.g.<br>
brush border peptidases, esterases). These enzymes degrade proteins, lipids,<br>
carbohydrates, and nucleic acids contained in ingested food. Thus, it can be expected<br>
that the controlled substance will be released from the attached chemical moiety<br>
when the appropriate enzyme(s) is encountered in the gastrointestinal tract.<br>
[048]	In another embodiment of the invention, the chemical moiety is<br>
attached to the controlled substance in a manner in which it is not readily released by<br>
conditions found in the mouth (saliva), the intranasal cavity, the surface of the lungs,<br>
or in the serum. Extreme acid conditions encountered in the stomach are not present<br><br>
elsewhere in humans. Therefore, any acid dependent release mechanism will occur<br>
only after oral administration. Although, degradative enzymes are present in the<br>
aforementioned environments, they are not generally present in the high<br>
concentrations found in the intestinal tract. Thus, release of the controlled substance<br>
by enzymatic cleavage will not occur rapidly when the novel compounds are<br>
administered by routes other than oral delivery.<br>
[049]	In another embodiment of the invention, the analgesic (e.g.<br>
oxycodone or hydrocodone) is attached to a polymer of serine (or other amino acid<br>
containing a hydroxyl side chain e.g. threonine, tyrosine) via side chain hydroxyl<br>
groups. Alternatively, attachment is to a polymer of glutamic acid through the<br>
carboxyl group of the delta carbon of glutamic acid. The resulting ester (carbonate)<br>
linkages can be hydrolysed by lipases (esterases) encountered in the small intestine.<br>
Esterases are not present at high levels in saliva or on the mucosal surfaces of the<br>
nasal cavity, lungs, or oral cavity. Thus, controlled substances attached to<br>
polyglutamic acid by this method would not be rapidly released by saliva or when<br>
delivered intranasally or by inhalation.<br>
[050]	In another embodiment of the invention, the analgesic is attached to<br>
an oligopeptide, preferably consisting of between one and five amino acids. In a<br>
further embodiment of the invention the amino acids are a heterogenous mixture of<br>
the twenty naturally occurring amino acids. Hydrophilic amino acids will tend to<br>
prevent passive absorption of the analgesic peptide conjugate through nasal<br>
membranes. Thus it is a preferred embodiment of the invention that hydrophilic<br>
amino acids be included in the oligopeptide. It is a further preferred embodiment of<br>
the invention that lipophilic amino acids be attached closer to the analgesic for<br>
optimum stability. Both lipophilic and hydrophilic properties (i.e., amphiphilic) can<br>
be satisfied with between three and five amino acids. Thus it is a more preferred<br>
embodiment of the invention that the oligopeptide that is attached to the analgesic be<br>
an amphiphilic tripeptide.<br>
[051]	Preferred amphiphilic amino acids/oligopeptides may be selected<br>
from (i) hydrophobic amino acids, preferably in positions next to the active agent to<br>
provide increased stability; (ii) amino acid sequences designed to be cleaved by<br><br>
intestinal enzymes (e.g. pepsin, trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase, carboxypeptidases<br>
A and B, etc.) provide for increased bioavailability; (iii) peptides longer than three<br>
amino acids for increased stability, increased anti-abuse e.g. less membrane<br>
permeability, and potentially more efficient intestinal digestion e.g. major intestinal<br>
enzymes target proteins and polypeptides, (iv) or mixtures thereof. In one preferred<br>
embodiment the carrier portion of the conjugate is designed for intestinal cleavage.<br>
[052]	In a preferred embodiment the cleavage specificity is directed to<br>
pepsin and/or chymotrypsin. Examples of preferred carriers include XXXAA or<br>
XXAAA, where X is selected from any amino acid, except Arg, Lys, His, Pro, and<br>
Met and A is selected from Tyr, Phe, Trp, or Leu. Examples of more preferred<br>
carriers are selected from XXXPheLeu wherein X is Glu; XXXPheLeu wherein X is<br>
Gly; XXPheLeuLeu wherein X is Glu; and XXPheLeuLeu wherein X is Gly.<br>
[053]	In another embodiment the cleavage specificity is directed to trypsin.<br>
Examples of preferred carriers include XXXAA or XXAAA wherein X is any amino<br>
acid except Pro and Cys and A is Arg or Lys. Examples of more preferred carriers<br>
are selected from XXXArgLeu wherein X is Glu; XXXArgLeu wherein X is Gly;<br>
XXArgLeuLeu wherein X is Gly; XXXArgLeuLeu wherein X is Gly.<br>
[054]	The present invention provides covalent attachment of active agents<br>
to a peptide. The invention may be distinguished from the above mentioned<br>
technologies by virtue of covalently attaching the active agent directly, which<br>
includes, for example, pharmaceutical drugs and nutrients, to the N-terminus, the C-<br>
terminus or to the side chain of an amino acid, an oligopeptide or a polypeptide, also<br>
referred to herein as a carrier peptide.<br>
[055]	In another embodiment, the invention provides a composition<br>
comprising a peptide and an active agent covalently attached to the peptide.<br>
Preferably, the peptide is (i) an oligopeptide, (ii) a homopolymer of one of the<br>
twenty naturally occurring amino acids (L or D isomers), or an isomer, analogue, or<br>
derivative thereof, (iii) a heteropolymer of two or more naturally occurring amino<br>
acids (L or D isomers), or an isomer, analogue, or derivative thereof, (iv) a<br>
homopolymer of a synthetic amino acid, (v) a heteropolymer of two or more<br><br>
synthetic amino acids or (vi) a heteropolymer of one or more naturally occurring<br>
amino acids and one or more synthetic amino acids.<br>
[056]	The invention provides compositions comprising a carrier peptide<br>
and an active agent covalently attached to the carrier peptide. Preferably, the carrier<br>
peptide is (i) an amino acid, (ii) a dipeptide, (iii) a tripeptide, (iv) an oligopeptide, or<br>
(v) polypeptide. The carrier peptide may also be (i) a homopolymer of a naturally<br>
occurring amino acids, (ii) a heteropolymer of two or more naturally occurring<br>
amino acids, (iii) a homopolymer of a synthetic amino acid, (iv) a heteropolymer of<br>
two or more synthetic amino acids, or (v) a heteropolymer of one or more naturally<br>
occurring amino acids and one or more synthetic amino acids.<br>
[057]	In another embodiment, the invention further provides a composition<br>
comprising a single amino acid, a dipeptide or a tripeptide with an active agent<br>
covalently attached. Preferably, the amino acid, dipeptide or tripeptide are (i) one of<br>
the twenty naturally occurring amino acids (L or D isomers), or an isomer, analogue,<br>
or derivative thereof, (ii) two or more naturally occurring amino acids (L or D<br>
isomers), or an isomer, analogue, or derivative thereof, (iii) a synthetic amino acid,<br>
(iv) two or more synthetic amino acids or (v) one or more naturally occurring amino<br>
acids and one or more synthetic amino acids. In another embodiment the amino<br>
acids are selected from L-amino acids for digestion by proteases.<br>
[058]	In another embodiment, the peptide carrier can be prepared using<br>
conventional techniques. A preferred technique is copolymerization of mixtures of<br>
amino acid N-carboxyanhydrides. In another embodiment, the peptide can be<br>
prepared through a fermentation process of recombinant microorganisms followed<br>
by harvesting and purification of the appropriate peptide. Alternatively, if a specific<br>
sequence of amino acids is desired, an automated peptide synthesizer can be used to<br>
produce a peptide with specific physicochemical properties for specific performance<br>
characteristics.<br>
[059]	In another embodiment, direct attachment of an active agent to the<br>
carrier peptide may not form a stable compound therefore the incorporation of a<br>
linker between the active agent and the peptide is required. The linker should have a<br><br>
functional pendant group, such as a carboxylate, an alcohol, thiol, oxime, hydraxone,<br>
hydrazide, or an amine group, to covalently attach to the carrier peptide.<br>
[060]	In another embodiment, the invention also provides a method for<br>
delivering an active agent to a patient, the patient being a human or a non-human<br>
animal, comprising administering to the patient a composition comprising a peptide<br>
and an active agent covalently attached to the peptide. In a preferred embodiment,<br>
the active agent is released from the composition by enzyme catalysis. In another<br>
preferred embodiment, the active agent is released in a time-dependent manner<br>
based on the pharmacokinetics of the enzyme-catalyzed release.<br>
[061]	In another preferred embodiment, the active agent conjugates can<br>
incorporate adjuvants such that the compositions are designed to interact with<br>
specific receptors so that targeted delivery may be achieved. These compositions<br>
provide targeted delivery in all regions of the gut and at specific sites along the<br>
intestinal wall. In another preferred embodiment, the active agent is released as the<br>
reference active agent from the peptide conjugate prior to entry into a target cell. In<br>
another preferred embodiment, the specific amino acid sequences used are not<br>
targeted to specific cell receptors or designed for recognition by a specific genetic<br>
sequence. In a more preferred embodiment, the peptide carrier is designed for<br>
recognition and/or is not recognized by tumor promoting cells.<br>
[062]	In another preferred embodiment, the active agent delivery system<br>
does not require that the active agent be released within a specific cell or<br>
intracellularly. In a preferred embodiment the carrier and/or the conjugate do result<br>
is specific recognition in the body. (e.g. by a cancer cell, by primers, for improving<br>
chemotactic activity, by sequence for a specific binding cite for serum proteins(e.g.<br>
kinins or eicosanoids).<br>
[063]	In another embodiment the active agent may be attached to an<br>
adjuvant recognized and taken up by an active transporter. In a more preferred<br>
example the active transporter is not the bile acid active transporter. In another<br>
embodiment, the present invention does not require the attachment of the active<br>
agent to an adjuvant recognized and taken up by an active transporter for delivery.<br><br>
[064]	In a preferred embodiments the active agent conjugate is not bound to<br>
an immobilized carrier, rather it is designed for transport and transition through the<br>
digestive system.<br>
[065]	While microsphere/capsules may be used in combination with the<br>
compositions of the invention, the compositions are preferably not incorporated with<br>
microspheres/capsules and do not require further additives to improve sustained<br>
release.<br>
[066]	In a preferred embodiment the active agent is not a hormone,<br>
glutamine, methotrexate, daunorubicin, a trypsin-kallikrein inhibitor, insulin,<br>
calmodulin, calcitonin, L-dopa, interleukins, gonadoliberin, norethindrone, tolmetin,<br>
valacyclovir, taxol, or silver sulfadiazine. In a preferred embodiment wherein the<br>
active agent is a peptidic active agent it is preferred the active agent is unmodified<br>
(e.g. the amino acid structure is not substituted).<br>
[067]	In a preferred embodiment the invention provides a carrier and active<br>
agent which are bound to each other but otherwise unmodified in structure. In a<br>
more preferred embodiment the carrier, whether a single amino acid, dipeptide,<br>
tripeptide, oligopeptide or polypeptide is comprises only naturally occurring amino<br>
acids.<br>
[068]	In a preferred embodiment the carrier is not a protein transporter (e.g.<br>
histone, insulin, transferrin, IGF, albumin or prolactin), Ala, Gly, Phe-Gly, or Phe-<br>
Phe. In a preferred embodiment the carrier is also preferably not a amino acid<br>
copolymerized with a non-amino acid substitute such as PVP, a poly(alkylene oxide)<br>
amino acid copolymer, or an alkyloxycarbonyl (polyaspartate/polyglutamate) or an<br>
aryloxycarbonylmethyl (polyaspartate/polyglutamate).<br>
[069]	In a preferred embodiment neither the carrier or the conjugate are<br>
used for assay purification, binding studies or enzyme analysis.<br>
[070]	In another embodiment, the carrier peptide allows for multiple active<br>
agents to be attached. The conjugates provide the added benefit of allowing<br>
multiple attachments not only of active agents, but of active agents in combination<br>
with other active agents, or other modified molecules which can further modify<br>
delivery, enhance release, targeted delivery, and/or enhance adsorption. In a further<br><br>
embodiment, the conjugates may also be combined with adjuvants or be<br>
microencapsulated.<br>
[071]	In another preferred embodiment, the composition of the invention is<br>
in the form of an ingestible tablet or capsule, an intravenous preparation, an<br>
intramuscular preparation, a subcutaneous preparation, a depot implant, a<br>
transdermal preparation, an oral suspension, a sublingual preparation, an intranasal<br>
preparation, inhalers, or anal suppositories. In another embodiment, the peptide is<br>
capable of releasing the active agent from the composition in a pH-dependent<br>
manner. In another preferred embodiment the active agent is prepared and/or<br>
administered through means other than implantation and/or injectables.<br>
[072]	Embodiments of the present invention preferably are not bound to an<br>
adjuvant recognized and/or taken up by active transporters. Preferably, the active<br>
agent conjugates of the present invention are not attached to active transporters, or<br>
antigenic agents such as receptor recognizing sequences found on cells and tumors.<br>
Preferably, the active agent conjugate of the present invention is not connected to or<br>
constitutes an implantable polymer, which would not biodegrade in less than 48<br>
hours, preferably between 12 and 24 hours. The active agent conjugates of the<br>
present invention are preferably designed to release the active agent into the blood,<br>
after absorption from the gut, as the reference active agent.<br>
[073]	One embodiment of the invention relates to long acting narcotic<br>
drugs having significantly reduced abuse potential. The active agent is covalently<br>
bound to a peptide/oligopeptide or amino acid, which renders the active agent<br>
pharmaceutically inactive until released. Preferably the release mechanism is<br>
enzymatic action. Following oral administration the intestinal enzymes release the<br>
drug. The enzymatic and/or chemical conditions necessary for the release of the<br>
controlled substances is either not present or is minimally active when the drug-<br>
peptide conjugate is introduced by inhalation or injection. Thus it is expected that<br>
no euphoric effect will occur when the drug-peptide conjugate is inhaled or injected.<br>
Further, extending the release of the narcotic prevents spiking of drug levels which<br>
provide the desired analgesic effect with a lower or absent euphoria. Controlled<br>
substances with these novel properties are less likely to be abused due to the<br><br>
diminished "rush" effect of the modified controlled substance. Consequently,<br>
decreasing euphoria while increasing the duration of the analgesic effect enhances<br>
and reducing the likelihood of abuse increases the therapeutic value of these<br>
pharmaceuticals. The invention also provides for reproducible methods for<br>
compositions which are abuse-free for controlled substances, stable under a variety<br>
of chemical conditions, reduced euphoric effect and extended absorption into the<br>
bloodstream.<br>
[074]	The following examples are given by way of illustration and in no<br>
way should be construed as limiting as to the full scope of the invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1; Naltrexone<br>
[075]	Naltrexone, an opoid antagonist, was chosen as a model compound<br>
for testing conjugates for the hypothesis that conjugates of opoid drugs can afford<br>
extended release, while also lowering the potential for abuse. Naltrexone is<br>
chemically similar to orally delivered analgesics such as oxycodone and<br>
hydromorphone and therefore amenable to synthesizing conjugates for testing in<br>
vitro and in vivo performance.<br>
Synthesis<br>
[076]	Polyserine-naltrexone (carbonate-linked) conjugates were<br>
synthesized by the following method:<br>
1) Polymer activation. N-acetylated polyserine-methyl ester (0.69 g, 7.9 mmol) was<br>
dissolved in N-methylpyrolidinone (15 ml) and allowed to stir under argon at<br>
ambient temperature. Carbonyldiimmidazole (CDI, 1.93g, 11.9mmol) was added<br>
and the reaction allowed to stir over night under argon. Then, 100 ml of acetonitrile<br>
were added and the mixture allowed to sit at 4 °C for 2 hours. The precipitate that<br>
formed was collected by centrifugation and the resulting pellet then resuspended in<br>
acetonitrile. This suspension was then centrifuged and the pellet dried over night<br>
under a vacuum.<br><br>
2)	Tetrabutvlammonium salt of naltrexone. Naltrexone hydrochloride (1.5g,<br>
3.979mmol) was dissolved in water (~50ml) and this solution titrated with IN LiOH<br>
to a pH of -11-12. Tetrabutylammonium chloride (2.6g, 4.0mmol) was then added.<br>
The aqueous solution was then extracted with 3 equal volumes of chloroform (20ml<br>
each). The organic solutions were pooled and dried with magnesium sulfate. The<br>
solvent was then removed using a rotovap, and the resulting solid dried over night<br>
under a high vacuum.<br>
3)	Conjugation reaction. The solid material from step 1 was dissolved/suspended in<br>
15 ml of N-methylpyrrolidinone and the resulting solution placed under argon. The<br>
naltrexone salt from step 2 was then added, and the reaction then allowed to warm to<br>
-50-60 °C. The reaction was then allowed to stir two days under these conditions, at<br>
which point water was added (-200 ml). The aqueous solution was then<br>
concentrated by ultrafiltration (1000 mw cutoff). The concentrated solution (-5 ml)<br>
was then diluted to a volume of 50 ml with water. The aqueous solution was then<br>
titrated to pH 3 with IN HC1 and then concentrated by ultrafiltration. This process<br>
was repeated two more times. Following the final concentration, the aqueous<br>
solution (~5ml) was then freed of solvent using a rotovap and high vacuum. The<br>
resulting solid was then stored over night under high vacuum. This afforded 50 mg<br>
of brown solid. A serine:naltrexone ratio of approximately 1:6 (BB272) and 1:10<br>
(BB301) was estimated by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). A schematic of<br>
synthesis is shown in Fig. 1.<br>
Example 2: In vivo performance of polyserine-naltrexone conjugate (rat model)<br>
[077]	Polyserine-naltrexone conjugates were tested in Sprague-dawley rats<br>
(~ 250 g). Defined doses were delivered orally in gelatin capsules containing<br>
purified dry powder polyserine-naltrexone conjugates or naltrexone. No excipients<br>
were added to the capsules.<br>
[078]	Content of naltrexone in the polyserine-naltrexone conjugate BB272<br>
was estimated to be 30% as based on the 1:6 ratio of naltrexone:serine determined<br><br>
by NMR. Polyserine-naltrexone conjugate was given to four rats at a dose of 12 mg<br>
which contained 3.6 mg of naltrexone. Doses of naltrexone (3.6 mg) equivalent to<br>
the naltrexone content of the conjugate were also given to four rats. Capsules were<br>
delivered orally to rats at time-zero using a capsule dosing syringe. Serum was<br>
collected from rats 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 hours after capsule delivery. Serum naltrexone<br>
concentrations were determined by ELISA using a commercially available kit<br>
(Nalbuphine, product #102819, Neogen Corporation, Lansing MI).<br><br>
[079]	Serum levels of individual animals are shown in Table 1. Mean<br>
serum levels are shown in Table 3. (Example 2). As shown in Fig. 2, serum levels<br>
spiked earlier for naltrexone (2 hours) than for the drug administered as a<br>
polyserine-naltrexone conjugate (4 hours). Serum levels of naltrexone for the<br>
polyserine-naltrexone conjugate remained elevated considerably longer than for<br>
naltrexone. Additionally, the peak level was significantly lower for the polyserine-<br>
naltrexone conjugate. It should be noted that the 2 hour time point was the first<br>
measurement of naltrexone serum levels. Since this was the peak level measured for<br>
naltexone it can not be determined whether or not levels peaked at a higher<br>
concentration earlier. Consequently, it was not possible to accurately determine the<br>
Cmax or area under serum concentration curve (AUC) for naltrexone in this<br>
experiment.<br><br>
Example 3: In vivo performance of polyserine-naltrexone conjugate<br>
[080]	Polyserine-naltrexone conjugates were tested in Sprague-dawley rats<br>
(~ 250 g). Defined doses were delivered orally in gelatin capsules containing<br>
purified dry powder polyserine-naltrexone conjugates or naltrexone. No excipients<br>
were added to the capsules.<br>
[081]	Content of naltrexone in the polyserine-naltrexone conjugate BB272<br>
was estimated to be 30% as based on the 1:6 ratio of naltrexone:serine determined<br>
by NMR. Polyserine-naltrexone conjugate was given to five rats at a dose of 12.9<br>
mg which contained 3.6 mg of naltrexone. Doses equivalent to the naltrexone<br>
contained in the batch of polyserine-naltrexone (BB 301) were also given to five<br>
rats. Additionally, half the equivalent dose (1.8 mg) was given at time-zero,<br>
followed by a second half-dose at 6.5 hours to five rats.<br>
[082]	Capsules were delivered orally to rats at time-zero using a capsule<br>
delivery syringe. Serum was collected at 0.5, 1.5, 3, 5, 8, 12, 15 and 24 hours after<br>
capsule delivery for the polyserine-naltrexone (BB301) and equivalent naltrexone<br>
dosed rats. Serum was collected at 0.5, 1.5, 3, 5, 8, 11.5, 14.5 and 24 hours after<br>
capsule delivery for rats dosed with half-equivalent doses at 0 and 6.5 hours. Serum<br>
naltrexone concentrations were determined by ELISA using a commercially<br>
available kit (Nalbuphine, product #102819, Neogen Corporation, Lansing MI).<br><br><br>
[083]	Serum levels of individual animals are shown in Table 2. Mean<br>
serum levels are shown in Table 3. As shown in Fig. 3, naltrexone serum levels<br>
spiked earlier (0.5 hours) for naltrexone than for the drug administed as a<br>
polyserine-naltexone conjugate (5 hours). Serum levels of naltrexone for the<br>
polyserine-naltrexone conjugate remained elevated considerably longer (&gt; 12 hours)<br>
than for the monomelic naltrexone control (
crossed at approximately 7 hours. Additionally, the mean of the peak level<br>
concentration (Cmax) was significantly lower for the conjugated naltrexone (Table 4).<br><br>
Further, the mean time to peak concentration (Tmax) was significantly longer for the<br>
polyserine-naltrexone conjugate (Table 4). The mean AUC of the polyserine-<br>
naltrexone conjugate was approximately 75% of the naltrexone mean AUC (Table<br>
4). Statistically the mean AUCs were not significantly different (P
levels of rats fed one-half-dose (1.8 mg) at time zero and at 6.5 hours were<br>
compared to those of rats fed polyserine-naltrexone conjugate. Concentration levels<br>
remained elevated for the conjugate past those for the second naltrexone dose, with<br>
the curves crossing at approximately 2.5 hours and again at approximately 11 hours<br>
(double cross-over of the serum concentration curves).<br><br>
Example 4; Synthesis of an Analog of Hydrocodone<br>
[084]	A synthesized analog of hydrocodone, the compound, 6-0-<br>
ethoxycarbonyl hydrocodone (EtOCOhydrocodone), was prepared by reaction of the<br>
enolate of hydrocodone with ethylchloroformate. The hydrocodone portion was not<br>
released under a wide range of pH's and temperatures. EtOCOhydrocodone was<br>
studied in a rat model and its pharmacokinetics was nearly identical to that of the<br>
reference drug (Figure 4). Ethoxycarbonylhydrocodone's AUC is 90% of<br>
hydrocodone's AUC. EtOCOhydrocodone meets the criteria for an abuse-free<br>
narcotic (i.e., stability and in vivo release) when injected.<br>
[085]	Further, the C-terminus of glutamic acid, leucine, proline, lysine,<br>
serine and glycine where attached to the 6-0 position of hydrocodone and the C-<br>
terminus of glutamic acid to the 6-0 position of oxycodone. Figure 5 shows a<br>
general scheme for how amino acid/narcotic conjugates are synthesized using<br>
oxycodone and hydrocodone as examples. The anion of oxycodone (or<br>
hydrocodone) was reacted with the protected N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (OSu) of<br>
the respective amino acid, which is fully deprotected in HCl/dioxane to yield the<br><br>
final product. For example, the enolate of oxycodone is reacted with<br>
BocGlu(OtBu)OSu to yield 6-0-BocGlu(OtBu)-oxycodone, which when<br>
deprotected gives 6-0,a -glutamyloxycodone. This oxycodone derivative showed<br>
similar pharmacokinetics and had 20% greater AUC relative to the parent drug in a<br>
rat model. (Figure 6).<br><br>
Boc-Ser(CO-Methyl Naltrexone)-OtBu<br>
[086]	To a solution of methyl naltrexone (1.00g, 2.82 mmol) in THF at -<br>
78°C was added LiN(SiMe3)2 (1.0M in THF, 5.92 mmol) dropwise via syringe.<br>
This solution was stirred at -78°C for 1 hour. In a separate reaction, Boc-Ser-OtBu<br>
(0.220g, 0.84mmol) was dissolved in THF (5 ml) with NMM (0.10 ml, 0.92 mmol)<br>
and triphosgene (0.250 g, 0.84 mmol) added. This solution was stirred at -78°C for<br>
30 minutes. The first reaction was added slowly to the second at -78°C. The<br>
combined reaction was allowed to warm to ambient temperature and stirred for 18<br>
hours. After this, water (10 ml) was added. Solvent was removed and residue was<br>
partitioned between CHCls/water (50 ml each) and was extracted twice with CHCI3<br>
(50 ml). Combined organics were washed with brine(50 ml), pH 8 water(50 ml),<br><br>
dried with MgS04 and solvent removed. A preparative TLC was taken (100%<br>
CHC13). NMR of TLC material confirmed the presence of product.<br>
[087]	The results of examples 1 through 3 show that conjugation of<br>
naltrexone to a polymer of serine via a carbonate linkage can prevent spiking of the<br>
drug (decrease Cmax) and afford sustained release (increase Tmax while maintaining<br>
approximately equal AUC). Further, example 4 shows that carbonate linked<br>
compounds are substantially resistant to release of naltrexone by exposure to acid,<br>
base and protease. Other opoid conjugates can be synthesized in a similar manner to<br>
obtain similar characteristics. Example 5 provides an additional memod of synthesis<br>
by which opoid carbonate conjugates can be synthesized. In particular, this method<br>
allows for conjugation to oxycodone via a carbonate linkage.<br>
Example 6: Synthetic Protocol for Amino Acid Conjugate of (S)-amphetamine<br>
[088]	Synthesis of Protected Conjugate, Example = BOC-Glu(OtBu)-<br>
SAMP The starting material for all these syntheses is dextroamphetamine sulfate<br>
which was obtained from Sigma/Aldrich. Since the relative configuration denoted<br>
by the term "dextro" may not be relevant to the conjugates, the material is referred<br>
to here as the (S)-isomer. This absolute configuration does not change during the<br>
reaction sequences.<br>
[089]	To a solution of S-amphetamine sulfate (750 mg, 4.07 mmol) in 5 mL<br>
of anhydrous DMF stirring at room temperature in an oven-dried 50 mL flask under<br>
an Ar atmosphere was added 2.11 mL of diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA, 12.21<br>
mmol). After 5 minutes, BOC-Glu(OtBu)-OSu (1.709 g, 4.07 mmol) in 10 mL of<br>
anhydrous EtOAc was added and the mixture was allowed to stir at room<br>
temperature overnight. The tic (9/1 CHCl3/MeOH) indicates that the amphetamine<br>
starting material is gone since the UV-active spot on the baseline is no longer<br>
present.<br><br><br>
[090]	The reaction mixture was poured into 30 mL of EtOAc and washed<br>
with 2 X 50 mL of dilute HC1 in water (pH 3) and 50 mL of saturated NaCl. After<br>
drying over MgSO4, the solution was filtered and the solvent reduced by rotary<br>
evaporation. The residue was taken up in a minimum amount of methylene chloride<br>
and run through a silica flash column eluting with 50/1 CH2Cl2/MeOH (adding<br>
progressively more MeOH) to 30/1 CH2Cl2/MeOH. The fast running product was<br>
easily separated from the more polar components. After rotary evaporation of the<br>
solvent and drying overnight by high vacuum, the purified product (1.625 g, 95%)<br>
was ready for the next reaction. The NMR in CDCI3 was consistent with the<br>
structure.<br>
[091]	Synthesis of Deprotected Conjugate, Example = Glu-SAMP-HCl<br>
[092]	A mixture of BOC-Glu(OtBu)-SAMP (1.36 g, 3.23 mmol) and 10<br>
mL of 4M HC1 in dioxane was stirred at room temperature in an oven-dried flask<br>
under an Ar atmosphere overnight. At this time, the fast-moving protected<br>
intermediate was no longer visible on tic. The solvent was removed by rotary<br>
evaporation and the material was dried under high vacuum leaving 886 mg (91%) of<br>
the HC1 salt. The nmr (dmso-d6) was consistent with the product.<br><br><br>
[093]	Data from Rat Pharmakinetic Experiments Comparing Amphetamine<br>
with Peptide Conjugates<br>
[094]	Experiments involved male Sprague-Dawley rats (weight 250-300g)<br>
dosed at time zero by oral gavage with a solution of d-amphetamine sulfate<br>
(amphetamine) or an equimolar solution of one of the peptide conjugates. Serum<br>
samples were obtained by eye bleeds and concentrations determined by ELISA<br>
assays. (Figures 7 and 8).<br>
Example 7: In Vivo Performance Of Amphetamine Conjugates<br>
[095]	Pharmacokinetcis by Oral Administration<br>
Peptide-amphetamine conjugates and an equivalent amount of parent<br>
amphetamine contained in the conjugate were orally administered separately to male<br>
Sprague-Dawley rats (-250 g). Drugs were delivered as oral solutions in water. The<br>
amphetamine content of each conjugate was determined by NMR analysis. Serum<br>
levels of amphetamine were analyzed by ELISA (Neogene, Lexington, KY,<br>
Amphetamine kit. 109319).<br>
[096]	GluGlu-amphetamine and Phe-amphetamine had nearly equal Cmax<br>
and AUC to those of the parent drug (Table 5). The serum concentration curves are<br>
shown in Fig. 8. No change in the shape of the curve was observed for the<br>
amphetamine conjugates.<br><br><br>
Example 8: In Vivo Performance Of Narcotics Conjugates<br>
Pharmacokinetics by Oral Administration<br>
[097]	Peptide-narcotic conjugates and an equivalent amount of parent<br>
narcotic (hydrocodone or oxycodone) contained in the conjugate were orally<br>
administered separately to male Sprague-Dawley rats (-250 g). Drugs were<br>
delivered as oral solutions in water or phosphate buffered saline or as solids in<br>
gelatin capsules. The narcotic content of each conjugate was determined by HPLC<br>
analysis. Serum levels of hydrocodone and oxycodone were analyzed by ELISA<br>
(Neogene, Lexington, KY, Oxymorphone/Oxycodone kit. 102919 and<br>

include 13 peptide conjugates, 2 monosaccharide conjugates, and 2 lipid conjugates.<br>
Eleven of the nine peptide conjugates had 60% or greater bioavailability based on<br>
AUC. Examples, which when compared to an equivalent dose of the parent drug,<br>
include: Glu-Oxycodone which was 121% bioavailable (Fig. 6); GlyGlyLeu-<br>
Hydrocodone which was 82% bioavailable (Fig. 9), and GluGluGlu-HC which was<br>
117% bioavailable (Fig. 10). The Ribose-HC conjugate had 106% when compared<br>
to an equivalent dose of the parent drug (Fig 11).<br>
Oral Kinetics<br>
[099]	A sustained release profile was observed with one of the amino acid<br>
conjugates Glu-Oxycodone (Fig. 6). The compound showed a blunted curve<br>
(decrease in Cmax) combined with a 2- fold increase in time to peak concentration<br>
(Tmax) and approximately equivalent AUC. Glu-Oxycodone, however, is not<br>
sufficiently stable to warrant consideration as an anti-abuse product. No other<br>
narcotics compounds tested to date showed sustained release kinetics with equal<br>
AUC. One other compound, protected Glu-Leu-HC, showed an increase in Tmax<br>
without equal AUC.<br>

Table 7. In Vivo Performance of Opoid Conjugates Administered Intranasally<br><br><br>
Intranasal Bioavailability<br>
[0100]	Intranasal (IN) studies are summarized in Table 7. All peptide<br>
conjugates tested thus far had decreased absorption by the intranasal route.<br>
Preliminary data suggests that inhibition of absorption is correlated with 1) length of<br>
peptide, 2) polarity, and 3) charge. GluGlu-HC and GluGluGlu-HC were inhibited<br>
more than Glu-HC. A relatively lipophilic tripeptide GlyGlyLeu was not inhibited as<br>
much as the more polar tripeptide GluGluGlu-HC. GlupyroGlu-HC was absorbed<br>
more rapidly that GluGlu-HC, which has a greater net (negative) charge (Fig. 12).<br><br>
[0101]	The IN absorption of Ribose-HC (Fig. 13) was significantly inhibited<br>
(approximately 80%). This particular compound still contained small amounts of<br>
free hydrocodone; therefore, inhibition of absorption may have been essentially<br>
complete.<br>
[0102]	The IN model was used to test the absorption of EEE-HC in water<br>
and in saline (PBS, pH 7.4). The inhibition of IN absorption was more significantly<br>
inhibited in PBS than in water. Therefore other compounds should be tested in the<br>
IN model in water and perhaps other buffers.<br>
Example 9: Stability of Narcotic Conjugates<br>
[0103]	It is also possible to further stabilize any unstable conjugates by<br>
tethering to a larger peptide. To illustrate this point, the synthetic precursors, 6-0-<br>
BocGlu(OtBu)hydrocodone and 6-0-BocLys(NHBoc)-hydrocodone, which are<br>
completely stable in water at room temperature and under heated conditions as<br>
shown in Table 8 and Table 9. The conjugates are also stable at a wide range of<br><br><br><br><br><br>
[0105]	The protected amino acid-hydrocodone compounds were tested in a<br>
typical rat model. Biphasic absorption of hydrocodone in rat sera fed 6-0-<br>
BocGlu(OtBu)-hydrocodone and 6-0-BocLys(NHBoc)hydrocodone was observed<br>
(Figure 14). The AUC's for both amino acid/hydrocodone conjugates are 75% of<br>
hydrocodone's AUC.<br>
[0106]	The stability of the amino acid/narcotic conjugates can be increased<br>
by tethering it to a larger peptide via the nitrogen on the amino acid residue. This<br>
will also extend the absorption of the orally administered drug. For instance, the<br>
dipeptides added to hydrocodone include GluGlu, LeuGlu, AlaPro, GluPro and<br>
GluLeu.<br>

Example 14: Analgesia of GlvGlvGlu-HC and ProProLeu-HC vs. HC<br>
Subcutaneously Injected<br>
[102]	Peptide-narcotic conjugates GlyGlyGlu-HC and ProProLeu-HC and<br>
an equivalent amount of HC contained in the conjugates were subcutaneously<br>
administered separately to male Sprague-Dawley rats (~250 g). The level of<br>
analgesia was scored by the PLL (paw lick latency) method using the hot plate<br>
nociceptive model as described (Tomkins, D.M., et al. J Pharmacol Experimental<br>
Therapeutics, 1997, 280:1374-1382). Table 10 shows the latency response of<br>
GlyGlyGlu-HC vs. HC. Basal PLL times of untreated rats were subtracted from the<br>
conjugate and hydrocodone PLLs. At thirty minutes analgesia of GlyGlyGlu-HC<br>
was 54 % and at 45 minutes was 8 %, when PPLs above basal level were compared<br>
to HC indicating that analgesia was significantly inhibited by the attached tripeptide.<br>
The latency response of ProProLeu-HC vs. HC is shown in Fig. 15 and Table 11.<br>
PLL times above 0 hour basal level of pretreated rats is was scored at 15, 30,45, and<br>
60 minutes. At the thirty minute peak of analgesia ProProLeu-HC was 9 % of that<br>
for hydrocodone. The PPL latency score of ProProLeu-HC gradually rose over time,<br>
however, at 60 minutes was still only 43% of the hydrocodone. (note: a cutoff time<br>
of 45 seconds was used in the PLL scoring in order to minimaize any harm to the<br>
animals. Most of the hydrocodone treated animals reached the maximum 45 seconds<br>
at peak analgesia).<br><br><br>
[0113]	The latency response of LeuLeuLeu-HC, ProProIle-HC,<br>
GlyGlyGlyGlyLeu-HC, and GlyGlyGlyGly-HC (2X the equivalent dose) is shown<br>
