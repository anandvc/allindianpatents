ACRYLIC ANTIMICROBIAL FIBER AND A METHOD OF MAKING<br>
THEREOF<br><br><br>
ADITYA BIRLA SCIENCE &amp; TECHNOLOGY CO. LTD.<br>
an Indian Company of Aditya Birla Center, 2nd floor, C Wing, S. K. Ahire Marg, Mumbai 400 025,<br>
Maharashtra, India<br><br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br><br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to textile fibers.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
The term "fiber" or "textile fiber" means a substance which is capable of being spun into a yarn or made into a fabric by bonding or by interlacing in a variety of methods including weaving, knitting, braiding, felting, twisting, or webbing, and which is the basic structural element of textile products.<br>
Fibers are classified on the basis of their length such as short fibers or staple fiber and long fibers or filament fiber. The fibers can also be classified on the basis of their origin such as natural fibers and man-made fibers. The term natural fibers means any fiber that exists as such in the natural state e.g. vegetable fibers or wood fibers. The other type of fibers is obtained from chemical substances. These are called man made fibers. They are rayon, polyester, nylon, acrylic (cashmilon) etc. For centuries, mankind has relied upon various plants and animals to provide raw materials for fabrics and clothing. In recent times, the industrialization and scientific advancement has provided several improved materials having far superior properties, particularly suitable for clothing.<br>
Acrylic  fibers  are  synthetic  fibers  containing  at  least  85%  of acrylonitrile<br>
monomer. The acrylic fibers are prepared from a polymer Polyacrylonitrile which<br>
is obtained by free radical polymerisation with an average molecular weight of<br>
-100,000. Typical properties of acrylic fibers include, resistance to moths, oils, and<br>
chemicals. Furthermore, they are also resistant to deterioration from sunlight<br>
exposure.<br>
The process steps involved in the preparation of Acrylic fibers are as follows:<br>
2<br><br>
The acrylic polymer is dissolved in solvents like N,N-dimethylformamide or aqueous sodium thiocyanate. Then it is metered through a multi-hole spinnerette and the resultant filaments are coagulated in an aqueous solution of the same solvent. The resultant filaments are washed, stretched, dried and crimped to obtain final acrylic fibers. Acrylic fibers are typically produced in a range of deniers from 1 to 15.<br>
Acrylic is lightweight, soft, and warm, with a wool-like feel. It dyes very well and has excellent colorfastness. It is resilient, retains its shape, and resists shrinkage and wrinkles. Acrylic fibers are commonly used in sweaters, hand-knitting yarns, rugs, awnings, boat covers, and beanies; the fiber is also used as a precursor for carbon fiber.<br>
From the spun or filament yarn, fabric is formed by knitting or weaving operations. Knitted fabrics can be made by using hooked needles to interlock one or more sets of yarns through a set of loops. The loops may be either loosely or closely constructed, depending on the purpose of the fabric. Knitted fabrics can be used for hosiery, underwear, sweaters, slacks, suits, coats, rugs and other home furnishings. Knitting is performed using either weft or warp processes.<br>
Some typical preparations that are involved in the weaving operations are warping, slashing or sizing. Sizing agents are added to the yarn by solution or pad/dry techniques. Differences in raw materials, processing chemicals, fiber diameter, post treatments and blend ratios can be manipulated, to produce a fiber having customized properties suitable for desired application. It is often desired that the acrylic fabrics possess typical properties such as thermal stability, ability to retain perfumes, antibacterial properties and the like. These properties are essential in several industrial as well as household applications. There has been a considerable<br><br><br>
interest in developing such materials. In order to impart various desirable properties to the fabric as mentioned above to the fabric, several constituents with various properties are added. Such constituents include antimicrobial agents, deodorizing agents, antistatic agents, perfumes. Besides such specific constituents, generic constituents for improving overall quality of the fabric, such as sizing agents, antimicrobial constituents for increasing yarn softness and pliability are also added.<br>
Prior Art<br>
US patent 5405644 discloses a process of manufacturing an antimicrobial fiber which involves mixing of silver-containing inorganic microbicide composition with fiber material which is further dipped in discoloration inhibitor containing solution.<br>
The process as disclosed in US 6368361 involves contacting and immersing the fiber in an aqueous solution containing a cationic surfactant with a quaternary ammonium salt group, a water-soluble protein, and an alkaline compound are dissolved. The fiber is then separated from the aqueous solution and immersed in another aqueous solution containing tea polyphenol which is an antimicrobial agent.<br>
A composite textile fabric involving a blend of two fabric layers wherein one of the fabric layers is coated with an antimicrobial agent such as silver and copper sulfide is disclosed in US Patent 6194332.<br><br><br>
20040247653 discloses a process of preparing an antimicrobial and antiviral polymeric material which involves embedding microscopic water insoluble powder particles of ionic copper oxide into the polymer material.<br>
US 4649078 discloses a lower temperature technique for incorporating antimicrobial agents into the fibers which involves passing the fiber into a liquid containing an antimicrobial agent such as bis(tri-n-butyl tin)oxide, n-trichloromethylthio phthalimide, n-(2-methylnaphthyl)maleimide, 2,4-dichlorobenzyl alcohol and 2-(n-octyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one.<br>
US 3959556 discloses method of preparation of improved composite antimicrobial yarns which involves extruding a spinnable solution of a synthetic thermoplastic resin and an antimicrobial agent. The antimicrobials are selected from a group consisting of 2,4,4'-trichloro-2'-hydroxydiphenyl ether; 2,2'-methylenebis- (3,4,6-trichlorophenol); and 2,2'-thiobis (4,6-dichlorophenol).<br>
US 6436419 discloses a method for preparing antimicrobial polymer which involves coating of a polymer with an acid dye attached with an quaternary ammonium salt (antimicrobial agent).<br>
Earlier known processes of incorporating such antimicrobial constituents, as reported in the above mentioned patents/applications, mainly involved conventional methods like spraying, encapsulating, solvent spinning the antimicrobial constituents on the fabric. However, these methods suffer from several disadvantages which include non-uniform and improper adhesion of antimicrobial constituents onto the fiber material and gradual washing out of the antimicrobial constituents over a period of time and which affects the feel and texture of the fabric.<br><br><br>
There is thus felt a need for a process of incorporating antimicrobial constituents into fabric which overcomes these shortcomings.<br>
Objects of the Invention<br>
It is an object of this invention to provide antimicrobial acrylic fibers, wherein at least one antimicrobial constituent is incorporated in the body of the fiber.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a process of incorporating antimicrobial constituents into acrylic fibers which ensures uniform distribution of the antimicrobial constituent throughout the fiber length.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide antimicrobial acrylic fibers wherein the antimicrobial constituents are retained in the acrylic product over a prolonged period of time.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide a process of incorporating antimicrobial constituents to acrylic fibers which does not affect the feel and texture of the fabric.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to provide a process of incorporating antimicrobial constituents to acrylic fibers such that inherent properties of the acrylic fibers such as fiber strength, linear density, tenacity, heat resistance, dyeability and drying properties are not altered.<br>

Detailed Description:<br>
Acrylic fibers were the first viable manufactured fibers. The reason behind the<br>
most widespread use of these fibers lies in their versatility. Furthermore, these<br>
fibers also have peculiar ability to blend easily with many fibers which makes them<br>
the fibers of choice.<br>
Though fibers and fabrics made from them have many desirable properties,<br>
oftentimes, consumers expect performance characteristics beyond those for which<br>
fibers were designed. In order to meet with these increasing expectations, various<br>
antimicrobial constituents are incorporated in the acrylic fibers. There has been a<br>
considerable interest in developing such materials.<br>
One of the additional desirable properties of acrylic fibers which has enormous<br>
demand is "antimicrobial activity".<br>
In accordance with this invention there is provided an antimicrobial acrylic formulation meant for manufacture of acrylic products comprising:<br><br><br>

Surfactants with HLB values within the range of 9 to 40 are used. Preferably, non-ionic or anionic surfactants with HLB values more than 13 are used.<br>
In accordance with one preferred embodiment of the invention, the HLB value of the surfactant is between 16 and 40.<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the invention, the antimicrobial constituent, the solvent and the surfactant are processed to form micro-reservoirs which are embedded into the body of the formulation. The antimicrobial acrylic contains uniformly dispersed micro-reservoirs throughout the body of the fibers. The micro-reservoirs are discrete, nano-sized structures without any definite geometrical shape.<br><br><br>
Typically, the average mean size of the micro-reservoir is in the range of 5 nm to 2000 nm.<br>
The invention also extends to an antimicrobial acrylic fiber, yarn and fabric manufactured from a formulation in accordance with this invention.<br>
In accordance with this invention there is also provided a process for preparation of an antimicrobial acrylic formulation meant for manufacture of acrylic products comprising the following steps :<br>
•	admixing a water-insoluble antimicrobial constituent with a non-aqueous solvent followed by heating the resulting admixture upto 95°C to obtain non-aqueous phase ;<br>
•	dissolving and stirring a surfactant, optionally with a co-surfactant, in water to obtain an aqueous phase;<br>
•	admixing and homogenizing the non-aqueous phase with the aqueous phase to obtain a micro-emulsion;<br>
•	dispersing the micro-emulsion throughout the mass of the acrylic polymer dope to obtain a preform mass wherein the antimicrobial constituent is in the form of evenly dispersed micro-reservoirs.<br>
Typically, the pH of the aqueous phase is in the range of 7 to 13.<br>
Typically, the amount of non-aqueous phase in the micro-emulsion is in the range of 0.1 to 40% of the mass of the micro-emulsion.<br>
Typically, the amount of surfactant in the micro-emulsion is in the range of 0.1 to 20% of the mass of the micro-emulsion.<br><br><br>
Typically, the proportion of antimicrobial constituent in the acrylic product is in the range of 0.001 to 5% with respect to the mass of the acrylic product.<br>
Before arriving at the optimum concentration of the surfactant to be used, cloud point of the aqueous phase is determined. Furthermore, alkalinity of the aqueous phase matches with that of the acrylic polymer dope thereby avoiding any drastic change in the alkalinity during the emulsification and homogenization step.<br>
Typically, the melted non-aqueous phase containing antimicrobial constituent in a non-aqueous solvent along with aqueous phase containing surfactants is emulsified using high speed mixers such as Ultraturrex or a mechanical emulsifier; a colloid mill; a high pressure homogenizer and an ultrasonic emulsifier to form a microemulsion. The micro-emulsion may contain further additional antimicrobial constituents, if desired.<br>
It is important that the non-aqueous phase is maintained in liquid state throughout the mixing process. The aqueous phase therefore is typically heated upto a particular temperature to ensure that the temperature of the resulting emulsion is above the melting point of the non-aqueous solvent. If this does not happen, the resulting emulsion will break down.<br>
The active ingredients are released from the micro-reservoir into the acrylic matrix. The structure of micro-reservoir, acrylic and surrounding conditions determine the release rate of the antimicrobial constituent. The molecules of the volatile antimicrobial constituents migrate from micro-reservoirs to the surrounding primarily by diffusion. The antimicrobial constituent is released from the matrix in a controlled release manner.<br><br><br>
Preform mass is spun to fiber in a bath containing 12.5% of Sodium thiocyanate solution. The temperature of the bath is maintained at -2.5°C. Thereafter, the fiber is cold stretched, gel treated at pH 2.8 at 45°C, then hot stretch at 90°C. The void in the fibers is removed by treating the fiber at 125°C. Fiber is then relaxed and annealed at 120 C and then taken up for post-treatment.<br>
The acrylic fibers can be further subjected to post treatment to make fabric which<br>
typically involves:<br>
o	Convert to Yarn in blend or pure<br>
o	Convert to Warp Beam<br>
o	Sizing<br>
o	Fabric Manufacturing- Weaving /Knitting<br>
o	Dyeing<br>
o	Finishing<br>
Alternatively, the filaments so obtained are further blended using standard equipment. The blended fibers are laid in to a web using standard equipment followed by Consolidation of the web to obtain Non-woven Acrylic Fabric. The acrylic product made from the formulation in accordance with this invention contains uniformly dispersed micro-reservoirs throughout the mass which is shown in Fig. 2.<br>
The antimicrobial constituent enriched acrylic fabrics as prepared in the above examples can be tested for antimicrobial activity by various test procedures which include antimicrobial assays used to determine or confirm the effectiveness of treatments applied to medical devices, medical and commercial textiles, and other products. Test methods for measuring the antimicrobial activity include ASTM, AATCC, and other modified methods. Testing includes antibacterial and antifungal activity, with both qualitative and quantitative assays available.<br><br><br>
AATCC 100 is a qualitative test for antibacterial activity.<br>
Test acrylic fiber/fabric specimens are placed into contact with a nutrient agar which has been streaked with a microbe such as Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli bacterial culture. Samples are inoculated with Staphylococcus and evaluated for percent reduction of the bacteria over selected contact periods of 1 -24 hours. Turnaround Time is usually 5 days. The specimens are then incubated at a temperature 37 °C for a period of time of 24 hours. After the 24 hour incubation period, the samples are visually checked for the growth of bacteria.<br>
The AATCC 174, Part III protocol provides a qualitative test for antifungal<br>
activity. Acrylic fiber/ fabric specimens are subjected to the growth of a common<br>
fungus, Aspergillus niger, on Sabouraud Dextrose agar. Prewet specimens are<br>
inoculated and incubated at 28 °C for seven days. Specimens are then assessed for<br>
growth	of	the	fungus.<br>
ASTM E2180-01 test method is used for testing inhibitory mold activity of the acrylic product (fiber /fabric) prepared in accordance with this invention.<br>
The antimicrobial acrylic fibers contain the entrapped antimicrobial constituent in releasable form. Microscopic examination of the micro-reservoirs in the acrylic fibers is shown in Fig 2.<br>
The resultant acrylic fabric containing antimicrobial constituent are tested. Linear Density (Denier) of the acrylic Fibers is determined by using standard ASTM Test Method (D 1577). The denier of the standard acrylic fiber (acrylic fiber without any antimicrobial constituents) and anti-microbial enriched acrylic fiber remains the same. Thus addition of antimicrobial constituents does not change the linear density of the acrylic fibers.<br><br><br>
Tensile strength and Young's modulus of acrylic fiber sample is tested on an Instron tensile testing machine as per the ASTM CI557-03 procedure at ambient temperature.<br>
Visual appearance of the antimicrobial enriched fiber is evaluated by methods as prescribed in AATCC 124. As far as parameters like % Loss in Dry Tenacity and % loss in dry elongation are concerned, these remain the same in the antimicrobial enriched acrylic fiber and the standard fiber. Incorporation of antimicrobial constituent in accordance with this invention does not affect the visual appearance of the fiber.<br>
Feel of the fiber: The antimicrobial enriched acrylic fiber as prepared in accordance with this invention offers the same feel effect as is observed in case of plain acrylic fiber without any antimicrobial constituent (Also referred as standard).<br>
Another important concern in textile industry is dye-ability of the fabric, which is tested by comparing the dyeability of the antimicrobial constituent enriched fabric and the standard acrylic fabric. Dyeability of the antimicrobial enriched acrylic fibers as prepared in accordance with this invention remains the same as that of the standard acrylic fiber.<br>
The invention will now be described with the help of the following non-limiting examples.<br><br><br>
Examples Example 1<br>

The acrylic fiber thus obtained contained micro-reservoirs having the entrapped releasable thermoregulatory constituents. Although the micro reservoirs did not<br><br><br>
have any specific shape or size, they were found to be uniformly distributed throughout the body of the fiber.<br>

Testing procedures:<br>
The antimicrobial acrylic products as prepared in the above examples (1 to 10) were tested by using following test procedures:<br>
1)	Linear Density (Denier) of the acrylic Fibers was determined by using standard<br>
ASTM Test Method (D 1577).<br>
The denier of the standard acrylic fiber (without any antimicrobial constituents) and anti-microbial acrylic fibers as prepared in accordance with example 1B was found to be uniform(1.5 denier) irrespective of the type and quantity of the antimicrobial constituent.<br>
2)	Tensile strength and Young's modulus of acrylic fiber samples were tested on an Instron tensile testing machine as per the ASTM CI557-03 procedure at ambient temperature.<br>
3)	Emulsion stability: The stability of micro-emulsions as prepared in the above examples was evaluated by keeping the same under observation in measuring cylinders for 3 days. During this period no phase separation was observed.<br>
4)	Feel of the fabric: The acrylic fabrics as prepared in the above examples and standard fabric (acrylic fabric without antimicrobial constituents), were randomly given to twenty subjects and they were asked to evaluate the texture and feel of the fiber. The test fiber material was interchanged several times amongst the human subjects. Collective results as submitted by the human subjects confirmed that nobody could distinguish between the antimicrobial acrylic fabrics prepared in accordance with the Examples provided above and the standard fabric.<br>

examples and the standard fabric as described above were dyed uniformly<br><br><br>
with reactive dyes. No noticeable difference as to the Dyeability of the two respective acrylic fabrics, with and without antimicrobial constituent was reported.<br>
6) Visual appearance of the antimicrobial acrylic fiber was evaluated by methods as prescribed in AATCC 124. As far as parameters like % Loss in Dry Tenacity and % loss in dry elongation are concerned, these remained the same(
The antimicrobial constituent enriched acrylic fabrics as prepared in the above examples can be tested for antimicrobial activity by various test procedures which include antimicrobial assays used to determine or confirm the effectiveness of treatments applied to medical devices, medical and commercial textiles, and other products. Test methods for measuring the antimicrobial activity include ASTM, AATCC, and other modified methods. Testing includes antibacterial and antifungal activity, with both qualitative and quantitative assays available.<br>
AATCC 100 (Part I) is a quanlitative test for antibacterial activity. Test acrylic fiber/fabric specimens are placed into contact with a nutrient agar which has been streaked with a microbe such as Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli bacterial culture. Samples are inoculated with Staphylococcus and evaluated for percent reduction of the bacteria over selected contact periods of 1 — 24 hours. Turnaround Time is usually 5 days. The specimens are then incubated at a temperature 37 °C for a period of time of 24 hours. After the 24 hour incubation period, the samples are visually checked for the growth of bacteria.<br><br><br>
The AATCC 147, Part III protocol provides a qualitative test for antifungal<br>
activity. Acrylic fiber/ fabric specimens are subjected to the growth of a common<br>
fungus, Aspergillus niger, on Sabouraud Dextrose agar. Prewet specimens are<br>
inoculated and incubated at 28 C for seven days. Specimens are then assessed for<br>
growth	of	the	fungus.<br>
ASTM E2180-01 test method is used for testing inhibitory mold activity of the acrylic product (fiber /fabric) prepared in accordance with this invention.<br>
