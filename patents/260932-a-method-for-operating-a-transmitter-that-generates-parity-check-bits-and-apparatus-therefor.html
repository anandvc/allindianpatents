Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method for operating a transmitter that<br>
generates parity-check bits and apparatus therefor, and generally to encoding and<br>
decoding data and in particular, to a method and apparatus for encoding and decoding<br>
data utilizing low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
As described in United States Patent No. 7,171,603, which is incorporated by<br>
reference herein, a low-density parity-check (LDPC) code is a linear block code<br>
specified by a parity-check matrix H. In general, an LDPC code is defined over a<br>
Galois Field GF(q), q&gt;2. If q=2, the code is a binary code. All linear block codes can<br>
be described as the product of a fc-bit information vector slxi with a code generator<br>
matrix G^ to produce an rc-bit codeword xlxn, where the code rate is r=k/n. The<br>
codeword x is transmitted through a noisy channel, and the received signal vector y is<br>
passed to the decoder to estimate the information vector slxi.<br>
Given an ^-dimensional space, the rows of G span the ^-dimensional codeword<br>
subspace C, and the rows of the parity-check matrix Tlmxn span the m-dimensional dual<br>
space C1, where m=n-k. Since x=sG and GHT=0, it follows that xHT=0 for all<br>
codewords in subspace C, where "T" (or "T") denotes matrix transpose. In the<br>
discussion of LDPC codes, this is generally written as<br>
HxT=0T,	(1)<br>
where 0 is a row vector of all zeros, and the codeword x=[s p]=[% s\, ...,%!, po, Pu<br>
• • • &gt; Pm-\\, where p0,..., pm-\ are the parity-check bits; and s0,..., sk.i are the systematic<br>
bits, equal to the information bits within the information vector.<br><br>
For an LDPC code the density of non-zero entries in H is low, i.e., there are<br>
only a small percentage of l's in H, allowing better error-correcting performance and<br>
simpler decoding than using a dense H. A parity-check matrix can be also described<br>
by a bipartite graph. The bipartite graph is not only a graphic description of the code<br>
but also a model for the decoder. In the bipartite graph, a codeword bit (therefore each<br>
column of H) is represented by a variable node on the left, and each parity-check<br>
equation (therefore each row of H) is represented by a check node on the right. Each<br>
variable node corresponds to a column of H and each check node corresponds to a row<br>
of H, with "variable node" and "column" of H referred to interchangeably, as are<br>
"check node" and "row" of H. The variable nodes are only connected to check nodes,<br>
and the check nodes are only connected to variable nodes. For a code with n codeword<br>
bits and m parity bits, variable node v,- is connected to check node c,- by an edge if<br>
codeword bit i participates in check equation j, i = 0, 1, ..., n-1, j = 0, 1, ..., m-1. In<br>
other words, variable node i is connected to check node jf if entry hjt of the parity-check<br>
matrix H is 1. Mirroring Equation (1), the variable nodes represent a valid codeword if<br>
all check nodes have even parity.<br>
An example is shown below to illustrate the relationship between the parity-<br>
check matrix, the parity-check equations, and the bipartite graph. Let an n - 12, rate-<br>
1/2 code be defined by<br><br>
with the left side portion corresponding to k (=6) information bits s, the right side<br>
portion corresponding to m (=6) parity bits p. Applying (1), the H in (2) defines 6<br>
parity-check equations as follows:<br><br><br>
H also has the corresponding bipartite graph shown in FIG. 1.<br>
As discussed above, the receiver obtains a contaminated version y of the<br>
transmitted codeword x. To decode y and determine the original information sequence<br>
s, an iterative decoding algorithm, such as belief propagation, is applied based on the<br>
bipartite graph. Soft information in the format of log-likelihood ratio (LLRs) of the<br>
codeword bits is passed between the bank of variable nodes and the bank of check<br>
nodes. The iteration is stopped either when all check equations are satisfied or a<br>
maximum allowed iteration limit is reached.<br>
A structured LDPC code design starts with a small mbxnb base matrix Hb,<br>
makes z copies of Hb, and interconnects the z copies to form a large mxn H matrix,<br>
where m= mbxz, n= nbxz. Using the matrix representation, to build an H from Hb each<br>
1 in Hb is replaced by a zxz permutation submatrix, and each 0 in Hb is replaced by a<br>
zxz all-zero submatrix. This procedure essentially maps each edge of Hb to a vector<br>
edge of length z in H, each variable node of Hb to a vector variable node of length z in<br>
H, and each check node of Hb to a vector check node of length z in H. The benefits of<br>
vectorizing a small matrix Hb to build a large matrix H are:<br>
1.	By using a different values of z, codes of rate kiJnb , where kb-nb-mb, can be<br>
designed for many different information sequence sizes k = zxkb from a single<br>
base matrix Hb.<br>
2.	Memory requirements are greatly reduced. With a structured LDPC design,<br>
only the base matrix Hb and the permutation for its l's need to be stored, which<br><br>
requires significantly less memory since Hb is typically much smaller than H<br>
and the permutation can be very simple.<br>
3. Encoding and decoding can be performed on groups of bits rather than by<br>
single bits. For example, a group of z messages can be fetched from memory,<br>
permuted, and passed between a vector variable node and a vector check node.<br>
Although the structured LDPC design philosophy greatly reduces the<br>
implementation complexity, a technique does not exist for designing the base matrix<br>
and assigning the permutation matrices for a given target H size which results in a<br>
LDPC code that has good error-correcting performance and can be efficiently encoded<br>
and decoded. Therefore, a need exists for a method and apparatus for designing a<br>
structured H and a method and apparatus for encoding and decoding data utilizing the<br>
structured H matrix.<br>

Detailed Description of the Drawings<br>
To address the above-mentioned need, a structured parity-check matrix H is proposed,<br>
wherein H is an expansion of a base matrix Hb and wherein Hb comprises a section<br>
Hbl and a section Hb2, and wherein Hb2 comprises a first part comprising a column hb<br>
having an odd weight greater than 2, and a second part comprising matrix elements for<br><br>
row i, column ji equal to 1 for i=j, 1 for 1=7+1, and 0 elsewhere. The expansion of the<br>
base matrix Hb uses identical submatrices for Is in each column of the second part<br>
H'b2, and the expansion uses paired submatrices for an even number of Is in hb.<br>
The present invention encompasses a method for operating a transmitter that<br>
generates parity-check bits p=(po. •••&gt; Pm-d based on a current symbol set s=Cs0, ••-, sk.<br>
x). The method comprises the steps of receiving the current symbol set s=(s0, ..., sk.i),<br>
and using a matrix H to determine the parity-check bits. The parity-check bits are<br>
transmitted along with the current symbol set. Matrix H is an expansion of a base<br>
matrix Hb where Hb comprises a section Hbl and a section Hb2, and wherein Hb2<br>
comprises a first part comprising a column hb having an odd weight greater than 2, and<br>
a second part H'b2 comprising matrix elements for row i, column 7 equal to 1 for i=j, 1<br>
for 1=7+1, and 0 elsewhere. The expansion of the base matrix Hb uses identical<br>
submatrices for Is in each column of the second part H'b2, and wherein the expansion<br>
uses paired submatrices for an even number of Is in hb.<br>
The present invention additionally encompasses a method for operating a<br>
receiver that estimates a current symbol set s=(s0, ..., sk.{). The method comprises the<br>
steps of receiving a received signal vector y=(y0 ■ • • yn-i) and using a matrix H to<br>
estimate the current symbol set s = (s0, ..., sk.{). Matrix H is an expansion of a base<br>
matrix Hb and wherein Hb comprises a section Hbl and a section Hb2, with Hb2<br>
comprising a first part comprising a column hb having an odd weight greater than 2,<br>
and a second part H'b2 comprising matrix elements for row i, column 7 equal to 1 for<br>
i=j, 1 for i=j+l, and 0 elsewhere. The expansion of the base matrix Hb uses identical<br>
submatrices for Is in each column of the second part H'b2, and wherein the expansion<br>
uses paired submatrices for an even number of Is in hb.<br>
The present invention additionally encompasses an apparatus comprising<br>
storage means for storing a matrix H, a microprocessor using a matrix H to determine<br>
parity-check bits, wherein H is an expansion of a base matrix Hb and Hb comprises a<br>
section Hbl and a section Hb2, with Hb2 comprising a first part comprising a column hb<br>
having an odd weight greater than 2, and a second part H'b2 comprising matrix<br><br>
elements for row i, column j equal to 1 for i=j, 1 for i=j+l, and 0 elsewhere. The<br>
expansion of the base matrix Hb uses identical submatrices for Is in each column of<br>
the second part H'b2, and wherein the expansion uses paired submatrices for an even<br>
number of Is in hb.<br>
The present invention encompasses an apparatus comprising storage means for<br>
storing a matrix H, a receiver for receiving a signal vector y=0&gt;o ... yn-i), and a<br>
microprocessor using a matrix H to determine a current symbol set (s0, • • •, sk.{). Matrix<br>
H is an expansion of a base matrix Hb with Hb comprising a section Hbl and a section<br>
Hb2, and wherein Hb2 comprises a first part comprising a column hb having an odd<br>
weight greater than 2. Hb2 comprises a second part H'b2 having matrix elements for<br>
row i, column j equal to 1 for i=j, 1 for i=j+l, and 0 elsewhere. Two identical<br>
submatrices are used to expand Is in every column of H'b2, and paired submatrices are<br>
used to expand an even number of Is in hb.<br>
Turning now to the drawings, wherein like numerals designate like<br>
components, FIG. 3 is a block diagram of encoder 300 in accordance with a first<br>
embodiment of the present invention. As shown, encoder 300 comprises<br>
microprocessor 301 and lookup table 303. In the first embodiment of the present<br>
invention, microprocessor 301 comprises a digital signal processor (DSP), such as, but<br>
not limited to MSC8300 and DSP56300 DSPs. Additionally, lookup table 303 serves<br>
as storage means to store a matrix, and comprises read-only memory; however, one of<br>
ordinary skill in the art will recognize that other forms of memory (e.g., random-<br>
access memory, magnetic storage memory, etc.) may be utilized as well. In a second<br>
embodiment, the functionality of the microprocessor 301 and the lookup table 303 can<br>
be incorporated into an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) or field<br>
programmable gate array (FPGA). In particular, the lookup table 303 can be<br>
implemented in a form of memory corresponding to the existence or non-existence of<br>
signal paths in a circuit.<br>
As discussed above, encoded data is generally output as a plurality of parity-<br>
check bits in addition to the systematic bits, where together the parity-check and<br>
systematic bits form a codeword x. In the first embodiment of the present invention, a<br><br>
parity-check matrix H is stored in lookup table 303, and is accessed by microprocessor<br>
301 to solve Equation (1). In particular, microprocessor 301 determines appropriate<br>
values for the parity-check bits p=(po&gt; • • • » Pm-i) based on the current symbol set s =<br>
(s0, ..., sk.{) and the parity-check matrix H. The parity-check bits and the symbol set<br>
are then passed to a transmitter and transmitted to a receiver.<br>
FIG. 4 is a block diagram of decoder 400 in accordance with one embodiment<br>
of the present invention. As shown, decoder 400 comprises microprocessor 401 and<br>
lookup table 403. In a first embodiment of the present invention, microprocessor 401<br>
comprises a digital signal processor (DSP), such as, but not limited to MSC8300 and<br>
DSP56300 DSPs. Additionally, lookup table 403 acts as storage means for storing<br>
matrix H, and comprises read-only memory. However, one of ordinary skill in the art<br>
will recognize that other forms of memory (e.g., random-access memory, magnetic<br>
storage memory, etc.) may be utilized as well. In a second embodiment, the<br>
functionality of the microprocessor 401 and the lookup table 403 can be incorporated<br>
into an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) or field programmable gate array<br>
(FPGA). In particular, the lookup table 403 can be implemented in a form of memory<br>
corresponding to the existence or non-existence of signal paths in a circuit.<br>
The received signal vector (received via a receiver) y=(y0, ..., yn.\) corresponds<br>
to the codeword x transmitted through a noisy channel, where the encoded data x, as<br>
discussed above, is a codeword vector. In the first embodiment of the present<br>
invention, a parity-check matrix H is stored in lookup table 403, and is accessed by<br>
microprocessor 401 to decode y and estimate the current symbol set s (i.e., the current<br>
symbol set (s0, ..., s^)). In particular, microprocessor 401 estimates the current<br>
symbol set (s0, ..., sk.{) based on the received signal vector y=Cy0, ..., yn-i) and the<br>
parity-check matrix H.<br>
As is well known in the art, there are many ways the decoder 400 can use the<br>
parity-check matrix H in the microprocessor 401 for decoding. One such way is to<br>
perform a vector-matrix multiplication with H to determine a likely error pattern.<br>
Another such way is to use H to construct a bipartite graph where the edges in the<br>
graph correspond to l's in H, and to iteratively process y on the bipartite graph.<br><br>
For a structured LDPC, the zxz submatrix may be a permutation matrix, a sum<br>
of permutation matrices, or any type of binary matrix. Since a permutation matrix P<br>
has a single 1 in each row and a single 1 in each column, the weight distribution of the<br>
expanded matrix H is the same as the base matrix Hb if the permutation submatrix is<br>
used. Therefore, the weight distribution of Hb is chosen as close to the desired final<br>
weight distribution as possible. The following description is illustrative of the case<br>
where the entries of Hb are replaced by permutation matrices, though any matrices<br>
may be used. If a permutation submatrix PzXz of a vector edge has a 1 at (row, column)<br>
entry (p(i), i), then the i-th edge within the vector edge is permuted to the /?(0_m<br>
position before the vector edge is connected to the vector check node. In other words,<br>
this permutation makes the i-th variable node within the related vector variable node<br>
connected to the/?0')-th check node within the related vector check node.<br>
The permutations comprising H can be very simple without compromising<br>
performance, such as simple cyclic shifts and/or bit-reversals. For instance, a simple<br>
circular right shift can be used. With this constraint, each H matrix can be uniquely<br>
represented by a mbYnb model matrix Hbm, which can be obtained by<br>
•	replacing each 0 in Hb by -1 to denote a zXz all-zero submatrix, and<br>
•	replacing each /*;■/= 1 in Hb by a circular shift size p(ij) where p(i,j) is non-<br>
negative.<br>
Since circular left shift (x mod z) times is equivalent to circular right shift<br>
((Z-JC) mod z) times, it is adequate to discuss circular right shift and refer it as a<br>
circular shift for brevity. As discussed previously, there is a one-to-one mapping<br>
between H and Hbm. Therefore, Hbm is a shorthand representation of H if z is given.<br>
Notationally, the model matrix is distinguished from the base matrix by the subscript<br>
'bm\ and the expanded matrix is distinguished by removing the subscript 'bm'. The<br>
relationship between the three matrices is illustrated in FIG. 2. Using the structure, the<br><br>
code has error-correcting performance similar to a random H of size mxn, while<br>
encoding and decoding are performed based on a much smaller Hbm.<br>
For example, the matrix of Equation (2) may be used as a base matrix Hb to<br>
build a model matrix Hbm as follows:<br><br>
When z=3, Hbm is converted to a (mbxz)x(nbxz) matrix H by replacing each -1 with a<br>
3x3 all-zero submatrix and each i with submatrix P;, i=0,1, 2, where<br><br>
Note that P0 is the identity matrix, and the columns of P„ i&gt;0, are the columns of P0<br>
circular right shifted i times.<br>
Given a vector q=[q0, qh q2], ?Po =[<?o><?i , ft], ffPi=[ft, <?o, ft]. <?P2=[ft, ft. 4oL<br/>
In other words, q P,- results in circular right shift of the vector q. On the other hand,<br>
P,- qT, results in circular upper shift of qT, or equivalently circular left shift of q.<br>
Similar rules apply when a zxz matrix Q is used: QP, results in circular right shift of<br>
the columns of Q, P,Q results in circular upper shift of the rows of Q.<br>
Base Matrix H<br>
For an LDPC code without vectorization, an H matrix with a modified staircase<br>
structure for the parity part of H leads to efficient encoding without compromising<br><br>
performance. In general, assuming x = [s p] = [s0, S\, ■ ■■,Sk-i,Pa,Pu ■■■,Pm-i\, %&amp; m-by-n<br>
H matrix can be divided into two submatrices,<br><br>
where H2 has a modified staircase structure, and Hj can be any binary matrix of size<br>
m-by-k. This same structure can be used to build the base matrix Hb in a structured<br>
LDPC design. Similarly, using the modified staircase structure, Hb can be partitioned<br>
into two sections, where Hbl corresponds to the systematic bits s, Hb2 corresponds to<br>
the parity-check bits p:<br><br>
Section Hb2 can be further partitioned into two sections, where vector hb has odd<br>
weight wh, and H b2 has a staircase structure:<br><br>
Section Hbl can be built randomly. Preferably the entire matrix Hb has a weight<br>
distribution as close to the desired weight distribution as possible.<br>
Shift Sizes<br>
To convert the base matrix Hb to the mfcxnb model matrix Hbm (which expands<br>
to H), the circular shift sizes p(ij) need to be determined for each 1 in Hb. The shift<br><br>
sizes can be first specified for the H2. After the shift sizes for the H2 section are<br>
determined, the Hi section shift sizes can be determined to achieve overall good<br>
performance of H. The Hi portion of the base matrix and the shift sizes of the Hj<br>
portion of the base matrix (section Hbml) can be assigned in many different ways. For<br>
example, random values for the shift sizes may be selected and accepted if the shift<br>
sizes do not cause significant performance degradation. Performance degradation may<br>
result from the introduction of excessive numbers of short-length cycles or low-weight<br>
codewords. Other techniques available in the LDPC art may also be used.<br>
The circular shift sizes p(ij) for a given target H size should be specified to<br>
allow efficient encoding without compromising decoding performance. To facilitate<br>
encoding, the shifts may be assigned such that all but one of the shift matrices<br>
corresponding to l's in hb cancel when added together, and all vector rows of Hb2<br>
cancel when summed up. This translates to assigning shift sizes to hb in pairs except<br>
for one entry, and assigning the same shift size to both l's in each column of H b2. For<br>
example, if hb = [1 0 0 1 0 0 1]T, it is acceptable to have hbm = [3 -1 -1 3 -1 -1 4]T as<br>
the corresponding column in the model matrix since shift size 3 is assigned in pairs.<br>
Since all of the non-zero entries (both l's) in each column H b2 are assigned the same<br>
shift sizes, any shift size option is equivalent to the shift size of 0 (i.e., identity<br>
submatrices) plus a permutation of the bits within the vector column. Thus, all shift<br>
sizes of H b2 can be assigned 0 for convenience, i.e., each 1 in H b2 is replaced by a zxz<br>
identity submatrix when expanding to H.<br>
Due to existence of cycles, the shift sizes of hbm should be assigned carefully.<br>
Rules can be applied to avoid forming short cycles or low weight codewords. One<br>
property that can be used to avoid cycles is:<br>
If 2c edges form a cycle of length 2c in base matrix Hb, then the corresponding 2c<br>
vector edges form z cycles of length 2c in the expanded matrix H if and only if<br><br><br>
where z is the expansion factor, p(i) is the circular shift size of edge i in the model<br>
matrix Hbm and edge 0, 1, 2, ..., 2c-l (in this order) form a cycle in Hb.<br>
Due to the structure of Hb2, cycles exist between hb and H b2. Thus any two<br>
identical shift sizes in hbm would result in replicating the cycle z times in the expanded<br>
matrix H according to the above property. However, if these two shifts are located far<br>
apart, then the cycles have long length, and have little effect on iterative decoding.<br>
Therefore, in a preferred embodiment, when hb of the base matrix has three Is, to<br>
maximize the cycle length, two Is that are assigned equal shift sizes can be located at<br>
the top and the bottom of hbm (as far apart as possible), while leaving one 1 in the<br>
middle of hb with an unpaired shift size. For instance, hbm = [3 -1 3 -1 -1 -1 4]T<br>
would result in z cycles of length 6 between h and H 2, while hbm =[3-14 -1 -1 -1<br>
3]T would result in z cycles of length 14 between h and H2, where h and H2 are<br>
expanded from hb and H b2.<br>
In summary, the Hb2 section is mapped to the model matrix<br><br>
where kb = nh-mb, there are wh (odd, wh &gt;=3) nonnegative entries in hbm, and the -1<br>
entries in H bm2 are left blank for brevity. All p(i,kb) values appear an even number of<br>
times in hbm except for one, which may be mapped to any non-zero submatrix.<br>
Therefore, all wh shifts could be given the same value (e.g., 0), since wh is odd. For<br>
Hbm2,.p0y) = JP(I+1 j),y=^6+1 ,fct+2, ..., nb-l, i=j-kb-\. In the preferred embodiment,<br><br>
assuming wh=3, one example has hbm = [0 -1 .. .-1 ph -1 ... -1 .. .0]T, ph mod z ^0, and<br>
P(i J) = /&gt;(*+1 j) = 0, j=kb+1 ,fcfc+2,..., nb-\, i = j-kb-l in the H bm2 portion.<br>
Although the discussion above focused on using submatrices that are circular<br>
shifts of the identity matrix, in general, any other submatrices may be used (and be<br>
represented in an equivalent to the base model matrix). In order to facilitate encoding,<br>
the constraints are then:<br>
1.	In every column of H bm2, the two non-zero submatrices are identical;<br>
2.	The wh (odd, wh &gt;=3) non-zero submatrices of hbm are paired (i.e., one<br>
submatrix is identical to another submatrix), except for one submatrix, which<br>
can be any non-zero matrix.<br>
Encoding<br>
Encoding is the process of determining the parity sequence p given an<br>
information sequence s. To encode the structured LDPC code, each operation is<br>
performed over a group of z bits instead of a single bit. Alternatively, vector<br>
operations do not have to be used, and the equations below are implemented in<br>
equivalent scalar form. To encode, s is divided into kb = nb-mb groups of z bits. Let<br>
this grouped s be denoted u,<br><br>
where each element of u is a column vector as follows<br><br>
Using the model matrix Hbm, the parity sequence p is determined in groups of<br>
z. Let the grouped p be denoted v,<br><br><br>
where each element of v is a column vector as follows<br><br>
|<br>
Encoding proceeds in two steps, (a) initialization, which determines v(0), and (b)<br>
recursion, which determines v(i+l) from v(f), (f ^ i ^ mb-2.<br>
An expression for v(0) can be derived by summing over the rows of<br>
Equation (1) to obtain<br><br>
where x is the row index of hbm where the entry is nonnegative and is used an odd<br>
number of times. In the preferred embodiment, the top and bottom entries of hbm are<br>
paired, thus 1 
by Ppjx.jtj. For the special case considered iere where p(x,kb) represents a circular<br>
shift, P'ktj = P,_,,(Xlii) • In other words, v(0) is obtained by<br><br>
In general, the recursions expressed in Equations (16) and (17) can be derived<br>
by considering the structure of H b2,<br><br><br>
and<br><br>
where<br><br>
Thus all parity bits not in v(0) are determined by iteratively evaluating<br>
Equations (16) and (17) for 0 
In a preferred embodiment where the shifts sizes of the l's in ~H."bl are all zero,<br>
Equations (16) and (17) can be simplified to Equations (19) and (20),<br><br>
and<br><br>
Thus, as in the general case, all parity bits not in v(0) are determined by<br>
iteratively evaluating Equation (19) and (20) for 0 
Equations (14), (19), and (20) describe the encoding algorithm. These<br>
equations also have a straightforward interpretation in terms of standard digital logic<br>
architectures. First, since the non-negative elements p(ij) of Hbm represent circular<br>
shift sizes of a vector, all products of the form P^uOO can be implemented by a size-z<br>
barrel shifter. A circular shift size of zero may not need to be barrel-shifted. Since a<br>
barrel shifter that implements all possible circular shifts must provide connections<br>
from each input bit to all output bits, the speed with which it can be run depends upon<br><br>
z. For a given z, complexity can be reduced and speed increased by allowing only a<br>
proper subset of all possible circular shifts. For instance, Hbm could be constructed<br>
with only even circular shift sizes. The summations in Equations (14), (19), and (20)<br>
represent vector-wise XOR (exclusive OR) operations that are gated (i.e., do not<br>
update) when p(ij) = -1.<br>
To implement the summations in Equations (14), (19), and (20) the entries<br>
p(ij) of Hbm, 0 
width |~log2z~|+l bits. The grouped information sequence can be stored in a size-z<br>
memory, which can be read out in sequential order. As each information vector u(/) is<br>
read out, the corresponding entry from the Hbm ROM can be read out, which instructs<br>
the barrel shifter of the necessary circular shift. After the circular shift, a register<br>
containing a partial summation is updated. For Equation (14), after each inner<br>
summation is completed, the result can be used to update another register containing<br>
the outer summation. When the outer summation is complete, it can be circularly<br>
shifted by z~p(x,kb).<br>
Assuming the barrel shifting can be implemented in a single clock cycle,<br>
encoding can be accomplished in approximately (kb+l)mb clock cycles. This number<br>
can be reduced at the expense of mb-\ extra z-wide registers by computing and storing<br>
the summations of Equation (19) and (20), using results that become available as<br>
Equation (14) is being computed.<br>
Extending the Matrix<br>
The code extension procedure can be applied to the structured code to reach a<br>
lower-rate code. Progressively lower-rate code can be used in successive transmissions<br>
of an incremental redundancy (IR) procedure. Specifically, if the model matrix of the<br>
1st transmission is<br><br><br>
then the model matrix for the 2nd transmission may use<br><br>
etc., where for each transmission i, submatrix Hb'^2 has the format in (9) and has size<br>
mj'^ffll'1. The first transmission may send n£) = kb + n$) groups of bits,<br>
each group having size z. The<br>
decoding after the 1st transmission is performed using received signals of<br>
[«(0),M(l),...,M(A:i-l),v(l)(0),v(1)(l),...,v(1)(ml1)-l)] and (21). The 2nd transmission may<br>
send another mjp groups of bits of size z, [y(2) (o), v(2) (l),..., v^mf2' -l)J, where<br>
m2 = mf]z, and the bits of the first transmission and the second transmission together,<br>
[w(0),U(l),...lMfe -l),v(0),v
are a codeword corresponding to (22). Therefore, the decoding after the second<br>
transmission is performed based on (22) and the combined received signal from the 1st<br>
transmission and the 2nd transmission. This procedure may be repeated for more<br>
transmissions. The decoding after the 2nd transmission is based on a code of rate<br>
K/n<b kb mi2> which is lower than that of 1st transmission. This procedure may<br>
be repeated for more transmissions, with each additional transmission contributing to a<br>
stronger, lower-rate code.<br>
FIG. 5 is a flow chart showing the operation of encoder 300, and in particular,<br>
microprocessor 301. The logic flow begins at step 501 where a current symbol set (s0,<br>
..., sk_{) is received by microprocessor 301. At step 503, values of parity-check bits are<br>
determined based on the current symbol set and H. In particular, the parity-check bits<br>
(po, ..., pm-i) are determined as described above, with H being an expansion of a base<br>
matrix Hb. As discussed, Hb comprises a section Hbl and a section Hb2, and wherein<br>
Hb2 comprises a first part comprising a column hb having an odd weight greater than 2,<br>
and a second part comprising matrix elements for row i, column j equal to 1 for i-j, 1<br><br>
for 1=7+1, and 0 elsewhere. In addition, the expansion of the base matrix Hb (to<br>
produce H) uses identical submatrices for the Is in each column of the second part<br>
H'b2, and wherein the expansion uses paired submatrices for an even number of Is in<br>
hb. At step 505 the current symbol set and the parity-check bits are transmitted via<br>
over-the-air transmission.<br>
FIG. 6 is a flow chart showing the operation of decoder 400, and in particular,<br>
microprocessor 401. The logic flow begins at step 601 where the received signal<br>
vector y=0&gt;o&gt; •••, yn-i) is received. At step 603, estimates of the current symbol set s<br>
(i.e., the current symbol set (s0, ..., sk.{)) are determined based on H. As discussed, H<br>
is an expansion of a base matrix Hb and wherein Hb comprises a section Hbl and a<br>
section Hb2, and wherein Hb2 comprises a first part comprising a column hb having an<br>
odd weight greater than 2, and a second part comprising matrix elements for row z,<br>
column 7 equal to 1 for i=j, 1 for 1=7+1, and 0 elsewhere.<br>
While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference<br>
to a particular embodiment, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various<br>
changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and<br>
scope of the invention. For example, while the invention has been shown with the<br>
ordering of s{ andpi within x defined, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that<br>
other ordering of the bits within x can occur since the codeword bits can be collected<br>
in any order as long as the columns of H are reordered accordingly. Additionally,<br>
while the above-description has been particularly shown and described with reference<br>
to binary codes (i.e., codes defined over the Galois Field GF(2)), one of ordinary skill<br>
in the art will recognize that an arbitrary GF may be utilized as well. Although the<br>
examples given above are shown in one format, other formats are possible which<br>
allow similar encoding and code modification procedure. For example, the rows of H<br>
may be permuted without affecting the value of the parity-check bits. In another<br>
example, the modified staircase structure may be used for a subset of the parity-check<br>
bits. In yet another example, additional steps may be performed when expanding the<br>
base matrix to the expanded matrix. The matrix H may also be used in any type of<br><br>
decoder that relies upon a parity-check matrix. It is intended that such changes come<br>
