THE PATENTS ACT,   1970<br>
[39 OF 1970]<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; Rule 13]<br>
"A THERMOPLASTIC MOULDING COMPOSITION"<br>
BAYER AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT, a body corporate organised under the laws of Germany, D-51368 Leverkusen, Germany,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a thermoplastic moulding composition,<br>
The present invention relates to polycarbonate compositions filled with special talc, •which are characterised by high toughness, rubber-glass transitions at low temperatures and good processability at low coefficient of thermal expansion.<br>
Filled and/or reinforced PC/ABS moulding compositions are known.<br>
For example, EP-A 0 391 413 describes PC/ABS moulding compositions containing inorganic fillers with special geometric properties, whereby the moulding compositions are specified by a low coefficient of linear thermal expansion, a high toughness under impact stress and a high heat resistance. Talc and non-calcined clay materials are described as fillers according to the invention.<br>
EP-A 0 452 788 describes talc-containing PC/ABS moulding compositions characterised in particular by a matt material surface.<br>
WO 09851737 describes mineral-filled PC/AES blends whereby 65-85 wt.% PC with 10-50 wt.% of a rubber-modified thermoplastic with 1-15 wt.% of a mineral filler are used for moulding compositions, together with applications thereof in the area of external vehicle body parts. Advantages are said to lie in the improved dimensional stability, thermal performance, notched impact resistance and flow characteristics in comparison with the prior art.<br>
The object of the present invention is the improvement of the notched impact resistance and hence of the rubber-glass transition at low temperatures. A low rubber-glass transition is especially important for external vehicle body parts, as even at temperatures well below zero brittle splintering of the material used can lead to serious injuries in the event of an accident.<br><br><br>
-%-<br><br>
It has now been found that impact-modified polycarbonate compositions containing the special talc described below demonstrate the desired property. In particular, the range of properties of the compositions according to the invention enables them to be used in the manufacture pf exterior vehicle body parts with outstanding surface quality for applications whk* require protection from flying splinters of material, even at low temperatures.<br>
The present invention therefore provides polycarbonate compositions containing impact modifiers and 0.05 \0 40, preferably 0.5 to 30 parts by weight, particularly preferably 1 to 20 parts by weight relative to the overall composition, of a special talc with an A1203 content of below 1 wt.%, preferably less than or equal to 0.9, particularly less than or equal to 0.7 wt.%, most particularly less than or equal to 0.5 wt.%, in each case relative to the talc.<br>
Preferred polycarbonate compositions are those containing<br>
A)	30 to 98 parts by weight, preferably 40 to 95 parts by weight, particularly preferably 45 to 90 parts by weight of at least one aromatic polycarbonate,<br>
B)	0.5 to 50, preferably 1 to 40, particularly preferably 1.5 to 30, most particularly preferably 5 to 25 parts by weight of at least one graft polymer,<br>
C)	0.05 to 40, particularly 0.5 to 30 parts by weight, particularly preferably 1 to 20 parts by weight, most particularly preferably 2 to 15 parts by weight of a talc according to the definition given here.<br>
The sum of the parts by weight of all components (A to C and optionally further components) comes to 100.<br><br><br><br><br>

Both homopolycarbonates and copolycarbonates are suitable. 1 to 25 wt.%, preferably 2.5 to 25 wt.% (relative to the total amount of diphenols to be used) of polydiorganosiloxanes with hydroxy aryloxy terminal groups can also be used for the manufacture of copolycarbonates for component A according to the invention. These are known (see for example US patent 3 419 634) or can be manufactured by methods known from the literature.

The thermoplastic aromatic polycarbonates and polyester carbonates can be used alone or in any mixture whatsoever.<br>
Component B<br>
Component B comprises one or more graft polymers of<br>
B. 1      5 to 95, preferably 30 to 90 wt.% of at least one vinyl monomer on<br><br><br>
B.2 95 to 5, preferably 70 to 10 wt.% of one or more graft bases with glass transition temperatures 
The graft base B.2 generally has an average particle size (dso value) of 0.05 to 10 (xm, preferably 0.1 to 5 urn, particularly preferably 0.2 to 1 (am.<br>
Monomers B.l are preferably mixtures of<br>
B.1.1 50 to 99 parts by weight of vinyl aromatics and/or vinyl aromatics substituted in the ring (such as styrene, oc-methyl styrene, p-methyl styrene, p-chlorostyrene, for example) and/or methacrylic acid (Ci-Cs) alkyl esters (such as methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate) and<br>
B.l.2 1 to 50 parts by weight of vinyl cyanides (unsaturated nitriles such as acrylonitrile and methacrylonitrile) and/or (meth)acrylic acid (Cj-Cg) alkyl esters (such as methyl methacrylate, n-butyl acrylate, t-butyl acrylate) and/or derivatives (such as anhydrides and imides) of unsaturated carboxylic acids (for example maleic anhydride and N-phenyl maleinimide).<br>
Preferred monomers B.1.1 are selected from at least one of the monomers styrene, a-methyl styrene and methyl methacrylate, preferred monomers B.l.2 are selected from at least one of the monomers acrylonitrile, maleic anhydride and methyl methacrylate.<br>
Particularly preferred monomers are B.1.1 styrene and B.l.2 acrylonitrile.<br>
Suitable graft bases B.2 for the graft polymers B are, for example, diene rubbers, EP(D)M rubbers, i.e. those based on ethylene/propylene, and optionally diene, acrylate, polyurethane, silicone, chloroprene and ethylene/vinyl acetate rubbers.<br><br><br>
EP(D)M rubber-based systems are particularly suitable for weather-resistant moulding compositions.<br>
Preferred graft bases B.2 are diene rubbers (e.g. based on butadiene, isoprene, etc.) or mixtures of diene rubbers or copolymers of diene rubbers or mixtures thereof with further copolymerisable monomers (e.g. as for B.l.l and B.1.2), with the proviso that the glass transition temperature of component B.2 is below 
Pure polybutadiene rubber is particularly preferred. EP(D)M rubber is likewise particularly preferred.<br>
Examples of particularly preferred polymers B include ABS polymers (emulsion, bulk and suspension ABS), such as are described for example in DE-OS 2 035 390 (=US-PS 3 644 574) or in DE-OS 2 248 242 (=GB-PS 1 409 275) and in Ullmann, Enzyklopadie der Technischen Chemie, vol. 19 (1980), p. 280 ff. The gel content of the graft base B.2 is at least 30 wt.%, preferably at least 40 wt.% (measured in toluene).<br>
The graft copolymers B are produced by radical polymerisation, e.g. by emulsion, suspension, solution or bulk polymerisation, preferably by emulsion or bulk polymerisation, particularly preferably by bulk polymerisation.<br>
ABS polymers produced by redox initiation with an initiator system consisting of hydroperoxide and ascorbic acid according to US-P 4 937 285 are also particularly suitable graft rubbers.<br>
Since it is known that the graft monomers are not necessarily fully grafted onto the graft base during the grafting reaction, graft polymers B according to the invention are also understood to denote products that are obtained by (co)polymerisation of graft monomers in the presence of the graft base and are collected during recovery.<br><br><br>
Suitable acrylate rubbers for B.2 of the polymers B are preferably polymers of acrylic acid alkyl esters, optionally with up to 40 wt.% relative to B.2 of other polymerisable, ethylenically unsaturated monomers. The preferred polymerisable acrylic acid esters include Ci-Cg alkyl esters, for example methyl, ethyl, butyl, n-octyl and 2-ethylhexyl esters; halogen alkyl esters, preferably halogen Cj-Cs alkyl esters such as chloroethyl acrylate, and mixtures of these monomers.<br>
Monomers with more than one polymerisable double bond can be used for crosslinking. Preferred examples of crosslinking monomers are esters of unsaturated monocarboxylic acids with 3 to 8 C atoms and unsaturated monohydric alcohols with 3 to 12 C atoms, or saturated polyols with 2 to 4 OH groups and 2 to 20 C atoms, such as ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, allyl methacrylate, for example; polyunsaturated heterocyclic compounds, such as trivinyl and triallyl cyanurate; polyfunctional vinyl compounds, such as divinyl and trivinyl benzenes; but also triallyl phosphate and diallyl phthalate.<br>
Preferred crosslinking monomers are allyl methacrylate, ethylene glycol methacrylate, diallyl phthalate and heterocyclic compounds exhibiting at least 3 ethylenically unsaturated groups.<br>
Particularly preferred crosslinking monomers are the cyclic monomers triallyl cyanurate, triallyl isocyanurate, triacryloyl hexahydro-s-triazine, triallyl benzenes. The amount of crosslinked monomers is preferably 0.02 to 5, particularly 0.05 to 2 wt.%, relative to the graft base B.2.<br>
In the case of cyclic crosslinking monomers with at least 3 ethylenically unsaturated groups, it is advantageous to limit the quantity to below 1 wt.% of the graft base B.2.<br>
Examples of preferred "other" polymerisable, ethylenically unsaturated monomers that can optionally be used in addition to the acrylic acid esters for manufacture of<br><br><br>
the graft base B.2, include acrylonitrile, styrene, oc-methyl styrene, acrylamides, vinyl C1-C6 alkyl ethers, methyl methacrylate, butadiene. Preferred acrylate rubbers as graft base B.2 are emulsion polymers exhibiting a gel content of at least 60 wt.%.<br>
Other suitable graft bases according to B.2 are silicone rubbers with graft-active sites, such as are described in DE-OS 3 704 657, DE-OS 3 704 655, DE-OS 3 631 540 and DE-OS 3 631 539.<br>
The gel content of the graft base B.2 is determined at 25 °C in a suitable solvent (M. Hoffmann, H. Kromer, R. Kuhn, Polymeranalytik I and II, Georg Thieme-Verlag, Stuttgart 1977).<br>
The average particle size dso is the diameter above and below which respectively 50 % of the particles lie. It can be determined by ultracentrifuge measurement (W. Scholtan, H. Lange, Kolloid, Z. und Z. Polymere 250 (1972), 782-1796).<br>
Component C<br>
Talc is understood to refer to a naturally occurring or synthetically manufactured talc.<br>
Pure talc has the chemical composition 3 MgO-4Si02-H20 and hence a MgO content of 31.9 wt.%, a Si02 content of 63.4 wt.% and a content of chemically bonded water of 4.8 wt.%. It is a silicate with a layered structure.<br>
Naturally occurring talc materials generally do not display the above ideal composition as they are contaminated by partial exchange of the magnesium by other elements, by partial exchange of silicon, by aluminium for example, and/or by intergrowths with other minerals such as dolomite, magnesite and chlorite.<br><br><br>
The special grades of talc in the sense according to the invention are distinguished by a particularly high purity, characterised by an AI2O3 content of below 1 wt.%, preferably less than or equal to 0.9 wt.%, particularly preferably less than or equal to 0.7 wt.%, in particular less than or equal to 0.5 wt.%. Preferred talc grades in the sense of the invention are distinguished by, in addition to their high purity (AI2O3 content), a MgO content of 28 to 35 wt.%, preferably 30 to 33 wt.%, particularly preferably 30.5 to 32 wt.%, and a SiC-2 content of 55 to 65 wt.%, preferably 58 to 64 wt.%, particularly preferably 60 to 62.5 wt.%.<br>
Examples of commercial grades of talc corresponding to this definition include Naintsch A3, A7, AlO, A30 and Naintsch Prever M30 from Naintsch Mineralwerke GmbH (Graz, Austria) and the grades Finntalc M05SL, M03, M05 and M20SL sold by Omya GmbH (Cologne).<br>
Particularly advantageous is the use of the talc according to the invention in the form of finely ground grades with an average maximum particle size 6.50 of 
Examples of talc grades not in the sense of the invention include Naintsch SE-Standard, Naintsch SE-Super, Naintsch SE-Micro and Naintsch ST 10, 15, 20, 30 and 60, all sold by Naintsch Mineralwerke GmbH, and Westmin talc sold by Omya, MP50-26, MP99-10, MP99-54 and M25-38 from Pfizer.<br>
Further additives D<br>
The compositions according to the invention may also contain further polymers.<br>
Suitable examples are preferably vinyl (co)polymers (D.2) of at least one monomer from the group of vinyl aromatics, vinyl cyanides (unsaturated nitriles), (meth)acrylic acid (Ci-Cg) alkyl ester, unsaturated carboxylic acids and derivatives<br><br><br>
(such as anhydrides and imides) of unsaturated carboxylic acids. Particularly suitable are (co)polymers of<br>
D.2.1 50 to 99, preferably 60 to 90 parts by weight of vinyl aromatics and/or vinyl aromatics substituted in the ring, such as styrene, a-methyl styrene, p-methyl styrene, p-chlorostyrene) and/or methacrylic acid (Ci-Cg) alkyl esters such as methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, and<br>
D.2.2 1 to 50, preferably 10 to 40, parts by weight of vinyl cyanides (unsaturated nitriles) such as acrylonitrile and methacrylonitrile and/or (meth)acrylic acid (Ci-Cs) alkyl esters (such as, for example, methyl methacrylate, n-butyl acrylate, t-butyl acrylate) and/or unsaturated carboxylic acids (such as maleic acid) and/or derivatives (such as anhydrides and imides) of unsaturated carboxylic acids (for example maleic anhydride and N-phenyl maleinimide).<br>
The (co)polymers D.2 are resinous, thermoplastic and rubber-free.<br>
The copolymer of D.2.1 styrene and D.2.2 acrylonitrile is particularly preferred.<br>
The (co)polymers according to D.2 are known and can be produced by radical polymerisation, particularly by emulsion, suspension, solution or bulk polymerisation. The (co)polymers according to component D.l preferably exhibit molecular weights Mw (weight-average, determined by light-scattering or sedimentation) of between 15,000 and 200,000.<br>
Polyalkylene terephthalates (D.3) as described in EP-A-841 187 are also suitable.<br>
Polyalkylene terephthalates produced from terephthalic acid and/or reactive derivatives thereof (e.g. dialkyl esters thereof) and ethylene glycol and/or butanediol-1,4, and mixtures of these polyalkylene terephthalates are preferred.<br><br><br>
The compositions according to the invention preferably contain vinyl (co)polymers, polyalkylene terephthalates or mixtures hereof up to a quantity of 35, particularly preferably up to 30 wt.%, relative to the overall composition. Most particularly preferably the compositions according to the invention contain 5 to 30 wt.%, relative to the overall composition, of vinyl (co)polymer, polyalkylene terephthalate or mixtures hereof.<br>
The moulding compositions according to the invention can contain at least one other of the conventional additives, such as anti-drip agents, lubricants and release agents, nucleating agents, antistatics, stabilisers, dyestuffs, flame retardants and pigments, as well as fillers and reinforcing materials other than talc.<br>
The moulding compositions according to the invention containing the above components and optionally additives, are produced by mixing the relevant components by known means and melt compounding or melt extruding at temperatures of 200 °C to 300 °C in conventional units such as internal mixers, extruders and twin-shaft screws.<br>
The individual components can be mixed by known means either in succession or simultaneously, both at around 20 °C (room temperature) and at elevated temperature.<br>
On the basis of their excellent impact resistance and other good properties such as ESC behaviour (stress cracking resistance), rigidity, heat resistance, flowability and low-warpage properties, the thermoplastic moulding compositions according to the invention are suitable for the manufacture of all types of mouldings, particularly those with increased requirements for a rubber-glass transition at low temperatures.<br>
The moulding compositions according to the present invention can be used for the manufacture of mouldings, particularly also with thin walls. The mouldings can be manufactured by injection moulding or extrusion,  for example.  Examples of<br><br><br>
mouldings that can be produced include: housing components of all types, e.g. for domestic appliances such as juice extractors, coffee machines, mixers; for office equipment such as monitors, (laptop) computers, printers and copiers. Other possible areas of use include covers and conduits for electrical installations for the building sector and components for the automotive sector (e.g. external or internal vehicle body parts). The moulding compositions can also be used in electrical engineering, e.g. for switches, sockets and circuit boards.<br>
The invention likewise provides processes for the production of the composition, use of the composition for the manufacture of mouldings and the mouldings themselves.<br><br><br><br>

Production and testing of the moulding compositions according to the invention<br>
Components A to D are mixed in a 3 1 internal mixer. The mouldings are manufactured on an injection moulding machine model Arburg 270E at 240 °C.<br><br><br>
The notched impact resistance is determined at room temperature by method ISO 180 1A using specimens measuring 80 x 10x4 mm.<br>
The Vicat B softening point is determined according to DIN 53 640.<br>
The tensile modulus of elasticity is determined according to DIN 53 457 / ISO 527.<br>
Table 1: Composition of the moulding compositions<br><br>
Example	A	Bl	B2	Dl	CI	C5	C2	C3	C4	D3	D2<br>

b = brittle<br>
nd = not determined<br><br>
It is clear from Table 2 that with comparable tensile modulus of elasticity and Vicat temperature, the examples according to the invention exhibit a distinctly better impact resistance than the comparative example.<br>
If average particle diameter is plotted against notched impact resistance (Fig. 1), an increase in notched impact resistance is found as the particle size decreases, as expected. Surprisingly, however, a higher AI2O3 content (square) even with small particle sizes leads to a clear deterioration in notched impact resistance. The use of bulk ABS (example 6) as compared with emulsion ABS (example 1) with an otherwise equal filler composition provides a further clear increase in notched impact resistance of 62 % and a reduction of 20 °C in the rubber-glass transition.<br><br><br>
