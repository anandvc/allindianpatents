				<td>METHOD FOR OLIGOMERIZATION AND/OR POLYMERIZATION OF ETHYLENE WITH FLUSHING OF EQUIPMENT AND PIPING<br>
The present invention relates to a method for oligomerization or polymerization of ethylene and/or alpha-olefins utilizing reactor equipment and other equipment wherein starting material comprising monomer(s), catalyst, cocatalyst and solvent is transferred to a reactor equipment via first piping, and product material comprising oligomer and/or polymer, non-reacted monomer(s), catalyst, cocatalyst and solvent is discharged from the reactor equipment via second piping.<br>
Methods for oligomerization or polymerization of ethylene and other alpha-olefins are widely known in the art. For example, DE 43 38414C1 discloses a process for the preparation of linear alpha-olefins by oligomerization of ethylene, wherein oligomerization takes place in the pres¬ence of an organic solvent and a homogenous liquid catalyst. Usually, a catalyst is utilized in that process comprising a zirconium component and an organoaluminum component which acts as a cocatalyst.<br>
Such oligomerization or polymerization methods are usually carried out in that starting material comprising monomer(s), catalyst, cocatalyst and solvent is transferred to a reactor equipment via first piping. After conversion in the reactor equipment, product material comprising oligomer and/or polymer, non-reacted monomer(s), catalyst, cocatalyst and solvent may be discharged from the reactor equipment and can be further processed. For example, in the product material the catalyst may be deactivated, the solvent may be separated and the oligomer and/or polymer may be fractionated.<br>
Usually, such methods are continuously operated wherein non-reacted monomer(s) and solvent may be circulated in the oligomerization or polymerization plant.<br>
From time to time, the oligomerization or polymerization plant has to be cleaned as fouling, or in the worst case plugging may occur, especially fouling at the reactor walls and the walls of the piping. This cleaning is usually achieved by flushing the pipings and the reactor equipment with<br><br>
a, preferably, hot flushing medium. This flushing medium may be any suitable solvent, prefera¬bly white oil can be used, which has, generally, to be imported into the plant.<br>
The flushing of piping and reactor equipment results in significant quantities of contaminated flushing media which are to be disposed in a difficult and cost-intensive manner.<br>
Additionally, flushing of piping and equipment is especially relevant for that plant sections con¬taining reactive organoaluminum components, such as aluminum alkyls, which act as a cocata-lyst or activator. Thus, it is important to remove the organoaluminum components completely before the reactor equipment or piping is opened and exposed to atmosphere.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a method for oligomerization or polymerization which overcomes the drawbacks of the prior art. Especially a method shall be provided which avoids the use of a flushing medium which is to be disposed in a difficult and cost-intensive manner, but which flushing medium is suitable to remove reactive reaction components prior to maintenance.<br>
This object is achieved in that the first piping, second piping, reactor equipment and/or other equipment are flushed with a product fraction obtained by said or a respective previous method prior to and/or after that oligomerization or polymerization method. Of course, it is understood by someone skilled in the art that flushing the plant before carrying out the method for oli¬gomerization or polymerization utilizes a product fraction obtained in a respective previous method. Other equipment may be any equipment which is also provided in the oligomerization plant, such as storage vessels, lines, quenching units, separation units, etc.<br>
Most preferably, the method is the oligomerization of ethylene.<br>
In one embodiment, the product fraction is obtained from the product material by further proc¬essing, preferably purification and/or separation.<br><br>
It is still preferred that the product fraction is a fraction of linear alpha-olefins (LAO).<br>
Further, the LAO fraction may be a heavier product fraction, preferably the fraction containing C12-C18 product.<br>
It is also preferred that flushing is carried out for piping and equipment containing organoalumi-num compounds.<br>
Even preferred, the product fraction utilized for flushing is (re)processed in the method.<br>
Finally, one embodiment is characterized in that (re)processing comprises processing in a cata¬lyst deactivation section, solvent removal and product separation section and/or discharge sec¬tion.<br>
Surprisingly, it was found that a specific product fraction obtained in the method for oligomeri-zation or polymerization can be suitably utilized as a flushing medium. Thus, no additional flushing medium is required or is to be imported. The respective product fraction, preferably a specific LAO-fraction in a method for oligomerization of ethylene containing C12-C18 product, may be obtained within that method at a section before or after catalyst deactivation section, sol¬vent removal and separation section and/or discharge section. The disposal of the flushing me¬dium may thus be easily achieved within the oligomerization or polymerization plant in that the "contaminated" flushing medium is (re)processed in any of the plant sections following the reac¬tor. Thus, no cost-intensive disposal of the flushing medium or its export is necessary.<br>
The inventive method is preferably suitable for flushing piping and equipment containing or-ganoaluminum components, such as aluminum alkyls, which are utilized in the oligomerization or polymerization method as cocatalyst. These reactive cocatalysts may thus be easily removed completely before the system is opened and exposed to atmosphere for maintenance.<br><br>
Additional features and advantages of the inventive method are further illustrated with reference to the accompanying drawing, wherein the figure illustrates a schematic diagram of a plant for the production of linear alpha-olefins.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a reactor equipment 1 forming the basis reactor for oligomerization of ethyl¬ene to form linear alpha-olefins. Various piping 2, 3, 4, 5 is connected to that reactor equipment 1 for delivering monomer(s), catalyst and cocatalyst to the reactor and for removing reaction product from that reactor equipment 1. Additional piping (not shown) may be provided, e.g. for delivering solvent. As cocatalyst preferably an organoaluminum component is utilized which may be stored prior to introduction into the reactor equipment 1 in a cocatalyst containing vessel 6. After oligomerization in the reactor equipment 1 the reaction product, non-reacted mono¬mer(s), catalyst, cocatalyst and solvent may be discharged and may be transferred to a catalyst removal section 7 and afterwards to a product separation section 8 where the product may be separated into individual fractions. One product fraction, preferably a heavier product fraction of the oligomerization, such as the fraction containing C12-C18 product, may be, at least partially, transferred back as a flushing medium into the organoaluminum component containing vessel (or any other equipment or piping containing cocatalyst or any other reactive component) for flush¬ing the respective sections. A valve 9 is located in flushing line 10 so that flushing medium may be introduced into the cocatalyst vessel as desired. Thus, it is possible to flush selected parts of the equipment and piping prior to maintenance and exposition and opening of that sections to atmosphere. Additionally, no imported flushing medium is necessary for this purpose.<br>
The features disclosed in the foregoing description, in the claims and in the drawing may, both separately and in any combination thereof, be material for realizing the invention in diverse forms thereof.<br><br><br><br><br>
