Compact Water Lance Blower<br>
The invention relates to a water lance blower with a water lance that is pivotably arranged with its mouth on or in a hatch, with a drive system that is provided with at least two drive units for controlling the water lance, and with a retaining device for fastening the water lance blower to a wall. Such water lance blowers are used in particular for cleaning heating installations, wherein the water lance can blow a jet of water through the heating installation that is in operation and being flowed through with flames and/or smoke, onto wall areas reachable via the hatch.<br>
Water lance blowers of this type are described, for example, in WO 96/38701, WO 96/38702, WO 96/38703 and WO 96/38704. The water lance blowers emit a focussed water jet through the furnace onto the wall opposite. As a result of the kinetic water jet energy and the sudden vaporisation of water that has penetrated into pores of the deposits, flaking off of the soot, slag and ash soiling is carried out.<br>
The area of impact of the water jet generated by the water lance blower generally follows a specific, pre-determinable path on the surface to be cleaned, also known as a blowing path, wherein this path is generally in a wave-form, and possibly omits obstacles, apertures or other sensitive zones.<br>
In addition to control of the drive system by means of a template, which necessarily generates a very specific blowing pattern, dual axis controls are mainly used, with control axes at right angles to one another, in particular a horizontal and a vertical axis, in order to be able to easily generate wave-form blowing patterns. As a result, drive systems of known water lance blowers are provided with a horizontally orientated and a vertically orientated drive unit. At least one of the two drive units is also fastened with appropriate devices directly to the heating installation. The second drive unit of known drive systems is provided with devices by means of which this second drive unit can be fixed to the first drive unit in order to produce dual axis control. The<br><br>
second drive unit is mostly arranged such that, for example, it is additionally guided on the heating installation or parts of the drive system. Such a drive system is described, for example, in WO 93/12398.<br>
Because of the different requirements in relation to the fastening or guiding required, the drive units of individual, known drive systems are always configured differently. A drive unit is usually fixed onto a part of a framework. During operation, this drive unit moves both the other drive unit and a water lance, and for reasons of stability and rigidity is configured particularly robustly. In contrast to this, the second drive unit that is coupled in particular to the water lance is matched to the constructional design of the first drive unit. Specially configured retaining and fastening devices are therefore necessary.<br>
The individual components (such as, for example, the drive system, the water supply line, the control cabinet) of known water lance blowers are furthermore arranged around a centrally positioned water lance such that they are arranged in areas outside the slewing range of the water lance, in order not to limit the slewing range. Additionally, the water lance is connected to a water supply line that has to follow the movements of the water lance, and at the same time must not restrict it. Such a water supply line of known water lance blowers is thus directly removed from this slewing range after leaving the water lance. For these reasons, known water lance blowers require substantially more space than the actual movement of the water lance necessitates. This is particularly problematical when the place where a water lance blower is installed is delimited by a large number of the constructional requirements of the heating installation such as, for example, pipelines, supports, armatures and so forth. It is thus conceivable that the positioning of known water lance blowers at a desired place on the heating installation cannot be carried out as there is insufficient space for the entire water lance blower, even though the required slewing range for the water lance would be provided.<br>
The different embodiments of water lance blowers demand high degree of logistical complexity in production, operation and service. Production includes a large number of manufacturing processes that are dependent on the different types of drive units of<br><br>
the embodiment. A wide range of machines and tools, as well as specially trained personnel, are required for this purpose.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a water lance blower of the type described in the introduction, the space requirement of which substantially corresponds to the surface area beneath the maximum slewing range of the water lance, which is easy to assemble and to service, and which reduces the logistical demands described hereinabove to one operation, wherein the water lance can be controlled along pre-determinable blowing patterns at different speeds.<br>
The object is solved by means of a water lance blower according to claim 1. Further advantageous embodiments are described in the dependent claims.<br>
The water lance blower according to the invention is provided with a water lance that is pivotably arranged on the one hand with its mouth on or in a hatch, and on the other hand is connected to a water supply line. The water lance can blow a jet of water through heating installations that are in operation and being flowed through with flames and/or smoke onto wall areas that can be reached via the hatch. The water lance is controlled with a drive system with two drive units, and thus allows any blowing patterns desired to be generated by means of the water lance. The water lance blower furthermore has a retaining device that serves to attach the water lance blower onto a wall of the heating installation. This retaining device is distinguished in that parts of the water supply system are integrated into it.<br>
By integration of parts of the water supply into areas of the water lance blower that are arranged close to the water lance, the water lance blower is particularly compactly configured. The retaining device also represents a kind of adaptor between a usually rigidly configured water supply line and a moveable, flexible means for conducting the water to the water lance. The conducting means is moved only in a relatively small section, whereby lesser forces are required for moving the water lance, and the space in which parts of the water lance blower move are clearly reduced. It is precisely this reduction in the movement space that results in the positioning of the water lance blower according to the invention no longer necessitating a complex matching of the water supply system to the constructional circumstances of the heating installation.<br><br>
Accordingly, it is particularly advantageous when the retaining device is provided with at least one connecting device for a separate water supply line. In particular, the use of standardised connecting devices is advantageous, whereby the water supply lines can be configured rigidly, for example, as conduits. Furthermore, the retaining device has at least one connecting element for a flexible line for conducting water to the water lance. The design of the connecting element can be configured flexibly and, in the manner of the water conducting line, is orientated towards the water lance, wherein the desired slewing range of the water lance is not limited.<br>
It is particularly advantageous to design the retaining device with at least one distributor that divides a flow of water flowing through and connects the water supply line to at least two connecting elements. A large flow of water can thereby be subdivided into several streams of water such that a design of the more flexible water conveyance to the water lance appropriate for the application is possible.<br>
In accordance with an advantageous configuration of the water lance blower, at least one valve is integrated into the retaining device. The valve serves to regulate the pressure generated in the nozzle of the water lance, whereby the quality of the water jet generated can be easily influenced, in combination with a control unit, by an operative.<br>
In accordance with a further configuration, the flexible line is provided as a flexible hose system from the retaining device to the water lance, wherein the water flow is divided into two or more parallel hoses. The distribution of the water flow can take place either within the retaining device, as, for example, with a distributor, or through the hose system itself. The distribution of the water flow into two or more hoses results in substantially smaller radii of bending in the hose system, and thus contributes to the compactness and flexibility of the water lance blower.<br>
It is particularly advantageous to configure the hose system with four hoses that are arranged such that each hose is arranged with the centre point of its cross-section at the corners of an imaginary square. In this way, preferred directions of bending of the hose system are produced, which can be orientated according to the desired paths of motion of the water lance. The hoses can be fixed in this arrangement using simple means, such as, for example, cable ties.<br><br>
In accordance with a further development, the hose system is configured with three or more hoses that are arranged with the centre points of their cross-sections in a square. The orientation of the hose system also has to be matched to the paths of motion of the water lance such that friction upon the hose walls is as low as possible.<br>
According to a further embodiment, the hose system is provided with a hose jacket that surrounds at least in part two or more hoses. This can be done, for example, in areas of the hose system particularly stressed by bending or soiling. It is particularly advantageous when the hose jacket is provided with an anti-friction agent (for example, talcum) distributed substantially between the hose jacket and the hoses. In this way, friction occurring externally on the hose walls during bending stress is reduced.<br>
It is particularly advantageous when the parts of the water supply system integrated into the retaining device are arranged in a concentrated manner in one corner of the drive system. In this way the range of movement of the water lance is not limited.<br>
It is particularly advantageous, also independently of the rest of the design of the retaining device, when the drive system of the water lance blower is provided with two drive units that are distinguished in that they are configured as modules. This means that the drive units form autonomous functional units and as such are completely exchangeable. Identically designed drive units configured in this way in a drive system are consequently also mutually exchangeable. This has the advantage that, for example, during repair, the drive unit can simply be removed and replaced with a new drive unit. A modular embodiment of the drive units additionally reduces the logistical complexities for a business, which now has only to manufacture, store and logistically manage a reduced number of variants of the drive units. This substantially reduces the manufacturing and servicing costs for the business.<br>
Such a design of the drive system further supports the compact and simple arrangement of the water lance blower. The fastening of the retaining device to a heating installation can thus be carried out in the position desired. Proceeding from this position, the drive units can be arranged as desired, so, possibly taking into account the components of the heating installation, the drive units can be combined in<br><br>
such a manner that a desired pivoting range of the water lance can be implemented.<br>
The first and second drive units are arranged perpendicular to one another and connected together, wherein the first is connected to the retaining device, and the second drive unit is guided by the first. The second drive unit articulates the water lance so that the terminal area thereof can sweep a maximum projection surface during operation. An arrangement of the drive units is thus produced that is L-shaped in the edge positions of the path of travel of the first drive unit, and T-shaped in a central position of the path of travel. The orientation of the L or T shaped arrangement is unimportant. A frame is not needed for such an arrangement. The arrangement of the integrated parts of the water supply line in the area of a comer of the projection surface of the water lance is advantageous and particularly preferred.<br>
According to a further embodiment, the second drive unit of the drive system is configured with a connecting element that projects laterally from the second drive unit. The water lance is articulated with this end of the connecting element. The connecting element must thus be configured such that the freedom of movement of the water lance is not limited. The connecting element is also arranged such that the projecting end is orientated to the side of the drive system of the water lance blower opposite the retaining device that in particular has integrated parts of the water supply line.<br>
The orientation of the connecting element results in a very compact and space-saving water lance blower, as in this way the drive units and the retaining device are substantially arranged on a surface that can be pivoted over by the rear end area of the water lance. The connecting element is thus moved in a plane by means of two drive units, and consequently makes movement of the water lance possible. Because of the different positions of the water lance, the point of articulation of the connecting element varies. If the water lance is greatly inclined (for example, when both drive units are close to an edge position), the articulation point moves in the outer area of the water lance towards the flexible line. In an upright position, the point of articulation is closer to the mouth of the water lance. Furthermore, at the external ends, certain devices must be provided for fastening the flexible line, which do not limit the<br><br>
freedom of movement of the water lance. For this reason, the water lance is not articulated at its external end to the connection element, but instead extends further beyond the point of articulation. During operation of the water lance blower, this outermost end of the water lance sweeps a maximum surface upon which, with an appropriately equipped connecting element, both the drive units and the retaining device with integrated parts of the water supply line are arranged.<br>
According to a further configuration, the modular drive units are each provided with at least a motor, a spindle and a spindle nut. The motor is connected to the spindle, and consequently turns the spindle during operation, whereby the spindle nut mounted on the spindle is moved in a translatory manner. Such drive units are particularly suitable for accurate path controlling. In addition, they are distinguished by their simple construction.<br>
In accordance with a further development, the water lance blower is provided with a guidance system with slide shoes and rails. The spindle nut is then connected to the slide shoes. The slide shoes are guided by means of two parallel rails. The rails are directly fastened to the drive unit, and orientated such that they are parallel to the spindle. In this way, the bending and torsional rigidity of the drive unit is increased.<br>
It is particularly advantageous to configure the motors of the drive units as EC (electronic communication) motors. EC motors can be optimised according to the purpose of their application, and consequently enables reliable path movement of the spindle nut. Furthermore, these motors are distinguished by a low heat development, high revolution speeds, and the possibility of sensing the speeds of revolution in order to determine the paths covered by a spindle nut connected via a spindle. It is particularly advantageous when, in addition to control of the path of the water lance by means of the motors of the drive units, the water lance is configured with a movement sensor that notifies faults in the transmission of movement.<br>
According to a further development, the slide shoes are connected to a fastening element. The fastening element is then either connected to all those slide shoes that are moved in a translatory manner on a rail, or it is connected to all of the slide shoes. If the fastening element is connected to all the slide shoes, this represents a kind of<br><br>
platform that covers an area between the rails and fixes the spindle nut. A fastening element configured in this way significantly increases the torsional rigidity of the drive unit.<br>
The fastening element has positioning aids, according to a further configuration, to accurate orientation of structure that can be attached to the fastening element. The fastening element represents a kind of intersection with respect to the structures that are moved by the drive unit. Such structures are, for example, a further drive unit, the connecting element for fixing the water lance, or components that are part of a guideway on the heating installation. Accurate path control of the water lance along pre-determined blowing patterns at desired speeds requires accurate orientation of these structures on the drive unit. Using such positioning aids, faulty assembly is prevented.<br>
It is particularly advantageous to configure the positioning aids as pins, grooves or bores. These positioning aids can also be configured in combination as desired on a fastening element. With appropriate design of the structures to be attached, the positioning aids enable a kind of form fitting, and consequently support fixing of the structures in a pre-determinable position.<br>
According to a further development, a second drive unit can be fixed onto a fastening element of a first drive unit. This means that the first drive unit is configured such that it is able to be attached to the fastening element, in that, for example, cooperation is ensured between positioning aids and the second drive unit. Two drive units configured in a modular manner can thus be easily assembled to form a dual axis control for a water lance blower.<br>
According to a further configuration, the drive unit has a cage-like profiled rail and a cover. The cage-like profiled rail and the cover at least partially enclose the components of the drive unit that are sensitive to soiling. For, example, the motor, the spindle, the spindle nut, and the parts of a translatory guidance system with slide shoes and rails are particularly sensitive to soiling. Because of the location where it is mounted, the drive system for a water lance blower is exposed to a large degree to a wide variety of environmental conditions. The large amount of soot or ash in the<br><br>
surrounding air, as well as possible leaks or water spray, are kept away from the spindle and guidance system in this way.<br>
The rails of the guidance system are attached to the cage-like profiled rail. The side walls of the profiled rail at least partially enclose the rails and the slide shoes guided upon them. The cover is arranged above the spindle, and extends substantially between the side walls of the profiled rail. The arrangement of the profiled rail and cover is preferably done such that the internal and soiling-sensitive components are almost completely enclosed.<br>
It is particularly advantageous to arrange the fastening element outside the cage-like profiled rail. Connection of the fastening element to the slide shoes in the inside of the profiled rail is configured such that the areas of the profiled rail lying inside are sealed against soiling. The spindle, as well as the guidance system, are consequently protected and the fastening element additionally offers an external possibility for connection.<br>
The arrangement of the profiled rail and cover described results in the configuration of at least one gap. This gap is necessary for transferring the movement of the spindle nut to external structures, in particular the water lance of the water lance blower. According to a further configuration, the drive system is provided with at least one expansion bellows that is arranged such that it at least partially seals at least a gap between the profiled rail and cover. It is particularly advantageous to connect the expansion bellows on the one hand by its end to the cage-like profiled rail, and on the other hand to the fastening element. The expansion bellows is then provided in particular on the profiled rail, and consequently covers the at least one gap between the profiled rail and cover.<br>
In accordance with another configuration, the expansion bellows is not connected to the moveable fastening element, but provides protection during periods when the water lance blower is non-operational. This means that the expansion bellows is moved into a position at the beginning of the water lance blower's cleaning cycle in which it extends only over the edge areas of the gap, and after the cleaning cycle ends, is extended again and consequently covers the at least one gap as far as the fastening<br><br>
element. This configuration is particularly suitable in combination with additional sealing means on the gap that prevent penetration of soiling agents into the internal areas of the drive unit during operation of the water lance blower.<br>
According to a further configuration of the water lance blower, at least one slide shoe is respectively connected to a rail with a shuttle. With this, the fastening element can be attached both between the slide shoe and shuttle and onto the side of the shuttle facing away from the slide shoes. If the at least one shuttle serves as an interface with further structures, it is preferably provided with positioning aids. A shuttle is to be understood as an elongate structure that tapers at its narrow ends such that a wedge shape is formed. The shuttle is arranged in a gap between the profiled rail and the cover, and consequently protrudes out over the cover.<br>
Areas between stationary parts of the drive units such as, for example, the profiled rail or the cover, as well as the moveable parts (fastening element or shuttle) are configured, in accordance with a further development of the drive system, with a sealing means. Because of the accelerations and speeds occurring during operation of the water lance blower, the sealing means are robustly configured. Furthermore, the sealing means are matched to the external environment, wherein in this connection the temperature sensitivity of the sealing means is of prime importance, as the drive system is usually attached directly to the heating installation.<br>
The profiled rail and the cover are provided with rubber lips in a further configuration, which extend over the gap and lie against the shuttle. Preferably, the rubber lips are configured such that the rubber lips of the profiled rail and the cover of a gap at least partially touch one another. When there is translatory movement of the spindle nut, the shuttle is moved between the rubber lips of a gap, wherein the wedge-shape of the shuttle opens the rubber lips. Rubber lips configured in this way seal the gap between the cage-like profiled rail and the cover, and thus protect areas inside.<br>
Another particularly advantageous configuration of the water lance blower is provided with two bands for sealing the gap in the drive unit. The bands are connected to the profiled rail and to the cover, and extend over the gap that has to be sealed. Between these bands, the moveable structure is configured. It is particularly advantageous to<br><br>
use an outwardly orientated metal band and an inwardly orientated rubber band. The bands are in areas separated by the moveable structure, and open in the proximity of the moveable structure. The metal band represents, for example, a good protection against ash and so forth, while the flexible and elastic rubber band matches up with the moveable structure particularly well.<br>
According to yet another configuration, air at over-pressure can be introduced into the profiled rail. The air substantially disperses through the gaps between the profiled rail and cover. Because of the airflow from internal areas of the profiled rail outwards, the penetration of dirt and soot from the drive system environment is prevented.<br>
According to a further development of the water lance blower, the retaining device is distinguished by integrated control elements for at least one drive unit, or for forming and monitoring a water jet. These control elements influence, for example, the speed of revolution of the motor or regulate the water flow blown from the water lance.<br>
It is particularly advantageous to equip the retaining device with control indicators and/or operating elements, with which the control elements can possibly be influenced. In this way, the water lance blower can be controlled and steered locally by an operative. Integration of the control elements as well as control indicators and operating elements leads to a very compact configuration of a drive system for a water lance blower.<br>
According to a further development, the retaining device has connectors for a emote control and/or remote diagnostics. This means that, for example, the control elements are configured connectable via a bus system with a remote diagnostic station, and consequently remote monitoring of the mode of functioning of the water lance blower is enabled.<br>
The invention will hereinafter be explained in more detail with reference to particularly advantageous and preferred embodiments shown diagrammatically. There<br>
is shown, in:<br>

Figure 8 a schematic plan view of the embodiment of Figure 7.<br>
In Figure 1 an embodiment of a water lance blower is shown schematically. A water lance 18 is on the one hand pivotably arranged with its mouth 31 in a hatch 32, and on the other hand (not shown) connected to a hose system 21. The water lance 18 is then moved with two drive units 2 configured in a modular manner that each are provided with a motor 3, a profiled rail 10 and a cover 11. A first, vertically orientated drive unit 2 is attached by means of a retaining device 1 onto the heating installation. This vertically orientated drive unit 2 is connected to a second, horizontally orientated drive unit 2. The water lance 18 is articulated by means of a connecting element 27 with an end 36 projecting laterally 37 from the horizontally orientated drive unit 2.<br>
Parts of a water supply system are integrated into the retaining device 1. The retaining device 1 shown is thus provided with a connecting device 15 onto which a separate water supply line can be connected. Inside the retaining device 1 a distributor 17 is arranged that divides the flow of water supplied into several streams of water and conducts them to a corresponding number of connecting elements 16. In addition, the retaining device 1 is provided with a valve 44 for regulating the water pressure. The conduction of the water from the connecting elements 16 to the water lance 18 is done by means of a flexible hose system 21.<br>
The retaining device 1 is configured with different control indicators 20 and operating<br><br>
elements 24 with the aid of which the operational behaviour of the water lance blower can be observed and possibly be influenced. Steering elements 19 arranged in the retaining device 1 can be influenced by the operating elements 24. The steering elements monitor and regulate at least one motor 3 of a drive unit 2 and/or the formation of a water jet. The connectors 23 enable transmission of data that describe the operating behaviour of the water lance blower to a remote diagnostic unit, which is not shown.<br>
Figure 2 shows in perspective and schematically a detail view of an embodiment of a drive unit 2 and represents an arrangement of the components of a spindle and guidance system in the inside of a profiled rail 10 that is not shown, as well as a cover 11 that is also not shown. A motor 3 is connected to a spindle 4 and enables the transmission of a turning moment. A spindle nut 5 is arranged on the spindle 4 that can be moved in a translatory manner on the spindle 4.<br>
The spindle nut 5 is connected to slide shoes 6, wherein these are guided on two rails 7 orientated parallel to the spindle 4. Such a guidance system significantly increases the torsional rigidity of the drive system. Furthermore, the spindle nut 5 is connected to a fastening element 8 that has positioning aids 9 for accurate orientation of structures that are to be attached. Because of the fact that during operation of the drive units, relative movements take place between the spindle nut 5 and spindle 4 and between the rails 7 and the slide shoes 6, the drive unit 2 must be configured in a manner such that it is sealed against soiling and water, wherein advantageous embodiments are shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a perspective representation of an embodiment of a drive unit 2. The external structure of the drive unit 2 is formed by a cage-like profiled rail 10. The profiled rail 10 has a kind of base plate 40 and two side walls 41. Between the side walls 41 of the profiled rail 10 there is respectively formed a gap 12. A fastening element 8 is arranged outside the profiled rail 10 and thus provides possibilities for attaching further parts of the water lance blower. The embodiment shown has two expansion bellows 28 that extend at least partially over the gap 12. These expansion bellows 28 are not moved with the fastening element 8 when the water lance blower is<br><br>
in operation, but is positioned prior to the start of the cleaning cycle in the manner shown. In the embodiment shown with the expansion bellows 28, protection of the gap 12 is supplemented additionally by the arrangement of bands 29 and 30 (not shown). The fastening element is arranged between an outer metal band 29 and an inner rubber band 30. After the cleaning cycle, the expansion bellows 28 are pulled such that the entire gap 12 is covered as far as the fastening element 8. It is also possible to cover the gap 12 on both sides of the fastening element 8 respectively with an expansion bellows 28, wherein the fastening element 8 does not have to be conveyed into a specific position close to the end of the drive unit 2.<br>
Figure 4 shows a perspective representation of an embodiment of a drive unit 2. The external structure of the drive unit 2 is formed by a cage-like profiled rail 10. The profiled rail 10 is provided with a base plate 40 as well as two side walls 41. The side walls 41 are inclined inwards towards the side opposite the base plate 40. Between the side walls 41 of the profiled rail 10, a cover 11 is arranged. Between the cover 11 and a side wall 41 of the profiled rail 10, a gap 12 is formed respectively. In each gap 12 a shuttle 13 is arranged that can be moved in a translatory manner along the gap 12 by means of the spindle 4 and the motor 3. The translatory movement of the shuttle 13 is guided by means of two rails 7 on the base plate 40 of the profiled rail 10. In order to prevent dirt coming into the interior of the drive unit 2, the side walls 41 of the profiled rail 10 and the cover 11 are configured with sealing means, in particular rubber lips 14 that protrude over the gaps 12 and touch them in part. The shuttles 13 are surrounded by the rubber lips 14, wherein the wedge-shape of the shuttle 13 ensures problem free movement between the rubber lips 14.<br>
Figure 5 shows a section through a hose system 21 that is configured with four hoses 22. The four hoses 22 are each provided with a cross-section centre point 25 that, in the case of the embodiment shown, are arranged at the corners of an imaginary square (33). Furthermore, the hose system 21 is configured with a hose jacket 34 that surrounds the hoses 22. Between the hoses 22 in the inside of the hose jacket 34 slipping means 35 are located that reduce the friction occurring when the hose system 21 undergoes bending stresses.<br><br>
Figure 6 shows a further arrangement of hoses 22 of the hose system 21. The hose system 21 is configured with three hoses 22 that are arranged with their cross-section centre points 25 in a straight line 26. If there is bending of the hose system 21, preferably in a direction perpendicular to the straight line 26, the friction between the hoses 22 is significantly reduced as in this case the hoses 22 always have the same bending radii.<br>
Figure 7 and Figure 8 show schematically different views of an embodiment of a water lance blower with a water lance 18 that is arranged pivotably in a hatch 32, and serve to explain the space-saving arrangement of the water lance blower according to the invention. The water lance 18 is shown in an extremely inclined position that occurs when the spindle nuts (not shown) of the two drive units 2 are moved to an end position on the spindle 5 (not shown). The water lance 18 is moved or pivoted by means of a connecting element 27 with an end 36 projecting laterally. During operation of the water lance blower, the position of the water lance 18 changes, whereby it is guided within a pre-determinable range of movement 38 by means of the connecting element 27. The water lance 18 extends beyond this range of movement 38, wherein the end area 42 of the water lance 18 sweeps over a larger projection surface 39. This projection surface 39 can be seen as the minimum space requirement for the desired course of movement of the water lance. For this reason, the water lance blower according to the invention is configured such that it is located substantially within this projection surface 39. The retaining device 1 with the integrated parts of the water supply system 43 is then arranged in a corner 45 of the projection surface 39, so it faces the side 37 of the vertical drive unit 2, over which the end 36 of the connecting element 27 projects. The space available is thus employed very well.<br>
According to the operating and environmental conditions, the drive units 2 can also be provided with separate cooling, in particular air or water cooling integrated into the base plate 40.<br>
In this way, a water lance blower according to the invention can also be used in particularly hot areas. Channels that are in any case present in the base plate 40, which are necessary for manufacturing such profiled pieces, can be used as cooling channel<br><br>
..ithout the rest of the system being changed or affected by this.<br><br>
