				<td>LIQUID-COOLED INVERTER ASSEMBLY<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] The present invention generally relates to a liquid-cooled inverter<br>
and, more particularly, to a liquid-cooled inverter assembly of the type<br>
employed in an electric or hybrid vehicle.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Inverter assemblies are commonly employed in hybrid and electric<br>
vehicles to provide three phase operating power to an electric drive motor. In<br>
general, such inverter assemblies include a plurality of inverter switches<br>
mounted on a substrate. The inverter switches are electrically coupled<br>
between a direct current (DC) power source, such as a battery, and the electric<br>
drive motor by way of a bus bar. A capacitor may be electrically coupled<br>
between the bus bar and the DC power source to regulate fluctuations in<br>
voltage; however, depending upon the proximity of the capacitor to the<br>
switches, the capacitor may potentially induce voltage overshoots in the<br>
system. The inverter switches oscillate between open and closed positions to<br>
convert the direct current into alternating current (e.g., three phase alternating<br>
current) suitable for driving the vehicle's electric drive motor.<br>
[0003] During operation of the inverter assembly, the inverter switches,<br>
the bus bar, and the capacitor generate heat and the may consequently require<br>
thermal regulation to ensure proper functioning. For this reason, the inverter<br>
assembly may be provided with a liquid-cooling system, which actively<br>
circulates a dielectric coolant fluid over the active switches. However, the<br>
dielectric fluid may not contact and cool the bus bar, which is spatially offset<br>
from the substrate and the inverter switches. As a result, the liquid-cooling<br>
system may not achieve optimal cooling.<br><br>
[0004] It should thus be appreciated that it would be desirable to provide a<br>
liquid-cooled inverter assembly having a substrate with an integrated bus bar<br>
wherein the cooling system directs coolant over the inverter switches, the<br>
substrate, and the integrated bus bar to thereby cool the inverter assembly in a<br>
more efficient manner. It would also be desirable if the liquid-cooled inverter<br>
assembly included a capacitor and a means for the cooling thereof (e.g., a heat<br>
sink). Preferably, the liquid-cooled inverter assembly would be configured<br>
such that the capacitor resides proximate the substrate and inverter switches so<br>
as to minimize inductive interference. Furthermore, other desirable features<br>
and characteristics of the present invention will become apparent from the<br>
subsequent detailed description and the appended claims, taken in conjunction<br>
with the accompanying drawings and the foregoing technical field and<br>
background.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005] An inverter assembly includes a housing and a substrate disposed<br>
in the housing. The substrate includes at least a first conductive layer<br>
patterned to include an alternating current (AC) path and a direct current (DC)<br>
path. A plurality of inverter switches is mounted on the substrate and<br>
electrically coupled to the AC path and the DC path.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0006] The present invention will hereinafter be described in conjunction<br>
with the following drawing figures, wherein like numerals denote like<br>
elements, and:<br><br>
[0007] FIG. 1 is a simplified functional view of an electric drive system<br>
employing a liquid-cooled inverter assembly in accordance with a first<br>
exemplary embodiment of the present invention;<br>
[0008] FIGs. 2 and 3 are isometric and exploded views, respectively, of a<br>
liquid-cooled inverter assembly in accordance with a second exemplary<br>
embodiment of the present invention; and<br>
[0009] FIG. 4 is an isometric view of the inverter devices, mount plate,<br>
and capacitor of the liquid-cooled inverter assembly shown in FIGs. 2 and 3 in<br>
an assembled state.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF AT LEAST ONE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT<br>
[0010] The following detailed description is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and is not intended to limit the invention or the application and uses of the<br>
invention. Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any expressed or<br>
implied theory presented in the preceding technical field, background, brief<br>
summary, or the following detailed description.<br>
[0011] FIG. 1 is a simplified functional view of an electric drive system 10<br>
employing a liquid-cooled inverter assembly 11 in accordance with a first<br>
exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Inverter assembly 11 is<br>
coupled between a direct current (DC) power source 12 (e.g., one or more<br>
batteries and/or fuel cells) and an electric motor 14 of the type deployed on an<br>
electric or hybrid vehicle (e.g., a three phase motor). Inverter assembly 11<br>
converts direct current supplied by battery 12 into an alternating current (AC)<br>
suitable for driving electric motor 14. In particular, inverter assembly 11 may<br>
provide three phase operating power to electric motor 14<br><br>
[0012] Inverter assembly 11 includes a multi-layer substrate 16, which<br>
supports a plurality of power semiconductor devices (e.g., inverter switches)<br>
18. In the illustrated exemplary embodiment, substrate 16 includes three<br>
layers: a top conductive layer 20 (e.g., copper), a middle insulative layer 22<br>
(e.g., a ceramic, such as aluminum oxide or silicon nitride), and a bottom<br>
conductive layer 24 (e.g., copper). Switches 18 are preferably soldered to top<br>
conductive layer 20, although it should be appreciated that other attachment<br>
means may be utilized. A current-carrying bus bar is integrated into at least<br>
one layer of multi-layer substrate 16. For example, top conductive layer 20<br>
may be patterned to include a bus bar, which carries current to and from<br>
inverter switches 18. More specifically, top conductive layer 20 may be<br>
patterned to include at least two current paths; i.e., a DC path 26 and an AC<br>
path 28. If desired, top conductive layer 20 may also be patterned to include a<br>
control signal path 30.<br>
[0013] As shown in FIG. 1, DC path 26 may be coupled to battery 12 via<br>
electrical connections 34 and 36, and AC path 28 may be coupled to electric<br>
motor 14 via electrical connection 37. A third electrical connection 38 may<br>
further couple control signal path 30 to control circuitry 40 mounted on, for<br>
example, a printed circuit board (PCB) 42 (e.g., a gate driver board). In one<br>
option, control circuitry 40 and PCB 42 are combined into a single circuit<br>
card. During the operation of inverter assembly 11, control circuitry 40 sends<br>
control signals over connection 38 and path 30, which command switches 18<br>
to alternate between open and closed positions so as to convert the direct<br>
current received from battery 12 into alternating current suitable for driving<br>
electric motor 14.<br>
[0014] A capacitor bank 32 may be electrically coupled between battery<br>
12 and DC path 26 of conductive layer 20 to regulate voltage fluctuations<br>
(e.g., smooth out any voltage spikes) that may be produced by battery 12. In<br>
the illustrated exemplary embodiment, battery 12 is coupled to capacitor bank<br><br>
32 by way of a first electrical connection 34, and capacitor bank 32 is coupled<br>
to DC path 26 by way of a second electrical connection 36. As indicated in<br>
FIG. 1, capacitor bank 32 may be combined with the other components of<br>
inverter assembly 11 into a single module. In this case, capacitor bank 32 is<br>
preferably positioned proximate substrate 16 and inverter switches 18. For<br>
example, capacitor bank 32 may be positioned such that its upper surface<br>
resides adjacent, and possibly contacts, a surface of substrate 16 (e.g.. the<br>
lower surface of lower conductive layer 24). By positioning capacitor bank 32<br>
near substrate 16 and inverter switches 18 in this manner, inductive<br>
interference may be minimized. This example notwithstanding, it should be<br>
appreciated that capacitor bank 32 may be positioned at other locations within<br>
the inverter module or, alternatively, capacitor bank 32.<br>
[0015] During operation of inverter assembly 11, heat is generated by<br>
active inverter switches 18. In addition, heat may be produced in substrate 16<br>
and capacitor bank 32. To dissipate this heat, substrate 16 may be placed in<br>
physical contact with another body. For example, lower conductive layer 24<br>
may be mounted to the vehicle's chassis. In this manner, the temperature of<br>
inverter switches 18 and patterned upper conductive layer 20 may be regulated<br>
as heat conductively travels from conductive layer 20, through insulative layer<br>
22 and lower conductive layer 24, and into the vehicle's chassis (or other such<br>
body). In addition, capacitor bank 32 may also be placed in physical contact<br>
with substrate 16 (e.g., lower conductive layer 24) so that the heat generated<br>
thereby may be dissipated in a similar manner.<br>
[0016] To further increase heat dissipation, inverter assembly 11 may be<br>
equipped with a liquid-cooling system 46. Liquid-cooling system 46 is<br>
configured to circulate a coolant fluid over active inverter switches 18 to<br>
convectively cool switches 18. This coolant fluid may also contact, and thus<br>
convectively cool, patterned conductive layer 20 of multi-layer substrate 16.<br>
The coolant fluid circulated by liquid-cooling system 46 is preferably a<br><br>
dielectric liquid (e.g., fluorocarbon, silicone oil, or polyalphaolephin),<br>
although it will be appreciated that the particular coolant fluid selected will<br>
depend upon device chemistry and application.<br>
[0017] Liquid-cooling system 46 includes an outlet array 48, a pump 50, a<br>
cooling device 52, and a flow passage 54 including an inlet or fluid pick-up<br>
56. Outlet array 48 may be formed from a variety of materials, including, but<br>
not limited to, various metals (e.g., aluminum, copper, etc.), alloys, and<br>
plastics (e.g., an injection-molded plastic). Outlet array 48 includes an<br>
internal conduit 58 and a plurality of impingement outlets 60 each fluidly<br>
coupled to conduit 58. In one arrangement, outlet array 48 is disposed beneath<br>
PCB 42 and over switches 18 and substrate 16. Impingement outlets 60 are<br>
positioned so as to direct circulating coolant fluid onto the top surfaces of<br>
active inverter switches 18 and/or patterned conductive layer 20 of substrate<br>
16; e.g., each of outlets 60 may be disposed substantially above a different one<br>
of inverter switches 18.<br>
[0018] Impingement outlets 60 may assume any form suitable for<br>
directing circulating coolant fluid onto switches 18 and/or substrate 16. For<br>
example, impingement outlets 60 may each take the form of one or more holes<br>
created through the underside of outlet array 48. However, impingement<br>
outlets 60 each preferably comprise a fluid flow jet configured to create a<br>
stream of coolant fluid, or a spray nozzle configured to produce a fine or<br>
atomized mist. Embodiments of outlet array 48 may employ fluid flow jets,<br>
spray nozzles, or a combination of jets and nozzles depending upon desired<br>
performance characteristics. Spray nozzles tend to provide more efficient<br>
thermal cooling, while fluid flow jets help to preserve coolant fluid quality and<br>
may permit pump 50 to be of the low pressure variety thereby reducing cost<br>
and increasing system reliability.<br><br>
[0019] When pump 50 is energized, coolant fluid flows through flow<br>
passage 54, into outlet array 48, and over inverter switches 18 and substrate<br>
16. As the coolant fluid contacts switches 18 and substrate 16, heat is<br>
convectively transferred from the active inverter switches 18 and upper<br>
conductive layer 20 to the coolant fluid. The heated fluid is then collected at<br>
fluid pick-up 56 and drawn through flow passage 54 by pump 50. Cooling<br>
device 52 cools the heated coolant fluid as it flows through flow passage 54.<br>
Cooling device 52 may comprise any device suitable for this purpose,<br>
including, but not limited to, various types of heat exchangers and heat sinks.<br>
Next, the cooled coolant fluid enters the inlet port of outlet array 48. The<br>
coolant fluid flows along conduit 58 to impingement outlets 60, which then<br>
direct the coolant fluid over the active inverter switches 18 and substrate 16.<br>
This cycle is repeated to continually regulate the temperature of switches 18<br>
and substrate 16. By integrating the bus bar into substrate 16, inverter<br>
assembly 11 permits liquid-cooling system 46 to simultaneously cool inverter<br>
switches 18 and current-carrying components of inverter assembly 11, which<br>
increases the effectiveness of liquid-cooling system 46 and consequently the<br>
overall performance of inverter assembly 11.<br>
[0020] Depending upon the temperature of inverter switches 18 and the<br>
characteristics of the chosen coolant fluid, some portion of the circulated<br>
coolant fluid may vaporize upon contacting inverter switches 18. In this case,<br>
inverter assembly 11 may be provided with a condenser (not shown), which<br>
condenses the vaporized coolant fluid. The condensed coolant fluid then<br>
returns to the coolant fluid reservoir and is recirculated in the manner<br>
described above.<br>
[0021] FIGs. 2 and 3 are isometric and exploded views, respectively, of a<br>
liquid-cooled inverter assembly 70 in accordance with a second exemplary<br>
embodiment of the present invention. Inverter assembly 70 includes a housing<br>
72 (FIG. 2), which may plastic or another suitable material. As shown in FIG.<br><br>
3, liquid-cooled inverter assembly 70 may include a capacitor bank 74<br>
including a cover 75, a conductive mount plate 76, a plurality of inverter<br>
devices 78, an annular outlet array (e.g., a spray array) 80, and a gate driver<br>
board 82, which may be disposed within housing 72 in a stacked configuration<br>
as described (housing 72 and a pie-shaped section of gate driver board 82 and<br>
of spray array 80 are not shown in FIG. 3 for clarity).<br>
[0022] Inverter devices 78 (FIG. 3) each include a multi-layer substrate<br>
84, which supports a plurality of power semiconductor devices (e.g., switches<br>
85). As was the case previously, each substrate 84 includes a bus bar<br>
integrally formed thereon, which includes an AC path, a DC path, and a<br>
control signal path. The AC path includes an AC terminal 86, which may<br>
reside on an inner tab of substrate 84 in the manner illustrated in FIG. 3. The<br>
DC path includes first and second DC terminals 88 and 90 having opposite<br>
polarities (e.g., DC terminals 88 may be positive, and DC terminals 90 may be<br>
negative). In the illustrated exemplary embodiment, each DC terminal 88<br>
resides on an outer tab of substrate 84, and each DC terminal 90 resides on<br>
conductive mount plate 76, which functions as a current carrying bus-structure<br>
electrically coupled to substrate 84. This example notwithstanding, DC<br>
terminal 90 may be incorporated directly into substrate 84 and mount plate 76<br>
may be removed from inverter assembly 70 in alternative embodiments. In<br>
this case, each substrate 84 may be placed in direct physical contact with cover<br>
75 to heat sink capacitor bank 74.<br>
[0023] FIG. 4 is an isometric view of inverter devices 78, substrates 84,<br>
mount plate 76, and capacitor bank 74 in an assembled state. As can be seen,<br>
inverter devices 78 are disposed upon substrates 84, which, in turn, are<br>
disposed upon the upper surface of cover 75. First and second pluralities of<br>
conductive lugs 92 and 94 are disposed through the apertures provided<br>
through DC terminals 88 and 90, respectively. Lugs 92 and 94 extend through<br>
a plurality of channels 91 provided through cover 75 to electrically couple the<br><br>
integrated bus of each substrate 84 to capacitor bank 74. Capacitor bank 74 is,<br>
in turn, coupled to a direct current source (not shown), such as a battery of the<br>
type described above in conjunction with FIG. ]. A third plurality of<br>
conductive lugs 96 extends through the apertures provided through AC<br>
terminals 86. The exposed ends of the conductive lugs 96 are electrically<br>
coupled to an electric motor (not shown). As an example, housing 72 (FIG. 2)<br>
may be mounted on the electrical motor (e.g., bolted to the bell end of the<br>
motor) and exposed conductive lugs 92 may be electrically coupled to the<br>
windings thereof.<br>
[0024] As described previously, gate driver board 82 (FIGs. 2 and 3)<br>
commands switches 85 to oscillate between open and closed positions. To<br>
enable command signals to be sent from gate driver board 82 to switches 85,<br>
at least one electrical connection is formed between gate driver board 82 and<br>
the patterned conductive layer (or layers) of substrate 84. In the exemplary<br>
embodiment illustrated in FIG. 3, a plurality of spring pins 98 are utilized to<br>
electrically couple board 82 to the patterned conductive layer of substrate 84.<br>
Each spring pin 98 may pass through a guide channel 100 provided through<br>
spray array 80. When inverter assembly 70 is assembled, spring pins 98 are<br>
compressed between a lower surface of gate driver board 82 and an upper<br>
surface (i.e., the patterned surface) of substrate 84. If desired, spring pins 98<br>
may be soldered or welded to gate driver board 82 and/or substrate 84,<br>
although such a rigid coupling is by no means necessary. In addition, it should<br>
be appreciated that other electrical connections means may be utilized<br>
including, for example, wires and straight pins, which may pass through, or<br>
may be routed around, spray array 80. Alternatively, the electrical<br>
connections may comprise a tab extending from each substrate 84, which may<br>
be bent upward to contact gate driver board 82 and possibly soldered thereto.<br>
[0025] Referring collectively to FIGs. 2 and 3, spray array 80 is positioned<br>
within housing 72 so as to direct coolant fluid over inverter devices 78 and<br><br>
substrates 84 (e.g., spray array 80 may be disposed above inverter devices 78<br>
as shown in FIG. 3). To provide spray array 80 with a continuous coolant<br>
supply, inverter assembly 70 may be coupled to a coolant circulation system<br>
102 (FIG. 2), which continually exchanges coolant with inverter assembly 70.<br>
In one option, coolant circulation system 102 comprises a cooling device (e.g.,<br>
a heat exchanger) 106 and a pump 110. Coolant circulation system 102 is<br>
coupled to an inlet 112 and an outlet 114 provided on inverter assembly 70 by<br>
way of a fluid delivery tube 116 and a fluid removal tube 118, respectively.<br>
Coolant circulation system 102 removes heated coolant fluid from assembly<br>
70 via fluid removal tube 118, cools the heated coolant fluid, and then returns<br>
the fluid via fluid delivery tube 116. The cooled coolant fluid received at inlet<br>
112 is provided to spray array 80, which then directs the fluid over inverter<br>
devices 78 and substrate 84 in the manner described above. This example<br>
notwithstanding, it should be appreciated that cooling device 106 and,<br>
perhaps, other components of coolant circulation system 102 may be<br>
incorporated into inverter assembly 70 (e.g., built into the cover of the unit).<br>
[0026] The integration of a bus bar into each substrate 84 permits spray<br>
array 80 to simultaneously direct coolant fluid over inverter switches 85 and<br>
the current-carrying layer of substrate 84. This increases the thermal<br>
efficiency of the liquid cooling system and, therefore, the overall performance<br>
of liquid-cooled inverter assembly 70. In addition, conductive mount plate 76<br>
may be placed in contact with cover 75 and consequently serve as a heat sink<br>
for capacitor bank 74. As further advantage, the coolant may contact, and thus<br>
convectively cool, mount plate 76. As a still further advantage, capacitor bank<br>
74 is positioned in close proximity to inverter switches 85 (e.g., the upper<br>
surface of capacitor bank 74 resides adjacent mount plate 76 and near the<br>
lower surface of substrate 84), which minimizes the likelihood of electrical<br>
interference due to inductance.<br><br>
[0027] It should thus be appreciated that there has been provided a liquid-<br>
cooled inverter assembly employing a substrate with an integrated bus bar that<br>
achieves greater thermal efficiency by cooling the inverter switches and the<br>
substrate / bus bar. In one option, the liquid-cooled inverter assembly employs<br>
a capacitor, which is cooled (e.g., placed in contact with a heat sink, such as a<br>
mount plate or a surface of the substrate) and which is resides proximate the<br>
inverter switches so as to minimize inductive interference.<br>
[0028] Although the foregoing has described substrates having a<br>
conductive layer (or layers) patterned to include an AC path, a DC path, and a<br>
control circuit path, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the<br>
patterned conductive layer need not include a control circuit path; instead, the<br>
control circuitry may be connected to the inverter switches through an emitter<br>
or collector disposed on the substrate (e.g., via a spring pin of the type<br>
described above in conjunction with FIG. 3).<br>
[0029]	While at least one exemplary embodiment has been presented in<br>
the foregoing detailed description, it should be appreciated that a vast number<br>
of variations exist. It should also be understood that the embodiments are only<br>
examples, and are not intended to limit the scope, applicability, or<br>
configuration of the invention in any way. Rather, the foregoing detailed<br>
description will provide those skilled in the art with a convenient road map for<br>
implementing the exemplary embodiment or exemplary embodiments. It<br>
should be understood that various changes can be made in the function and<br>
arrangement of elements without departing from the scope of the invention as<br>
set forth in the appended claims and the legal equivalents thereof.<br><br>
