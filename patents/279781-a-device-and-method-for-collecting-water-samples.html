				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to collecting water samples. More particularly the present invention relates to a method and device for collecting water samples from different depths in water bodies.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
The increasing needs of understanding the water bodies and water contamination have necessitated the study of water from different depths in different water bodies. In order to collect representative and un-modified water samples there is a need for development of new, sampling techniques.<br>
Various types of water sampling devices are known in the art. US patent number 4302974, titled ‘Water sampling device’, discloses a device having a pliable container, a pair of rods attached to oppose sides of an opening formed in the container, a clutch assembly having a rotatable outer member and a rotatable core member with said rods attached thereto, a pull-down spring for urging the wing members to descend down the tubular member so as to unroll the pre-rolled container to expose the opening, a pair of wing members slidably mounted on a tubular member and operative to spread apart the sides of the initially deflated container, and a wind-up spring for rotating the rods to roll up and reseal the container. However the pliable container is expensive and not reusable and also sterility of the container cannot be assured.<br>
In another US patent number 4037477, titled Water Sampler Device’, a system is disclosed having a cylindrical container open at each end with a ball valve mounted at the openings adapted to rotate about their axis from an initially closed position when the device is launched into a body of water to prevent the contamination of the<br>
 <br>
container by the surface waters. Upon descending, a water pressure operated valve opens to equalize the pressure inside the container with that of the outside water pressure and causes the simultaneous rotation of the valves to an open position to permit water to flush through the device until it reaches the predetermined depth at which the sample is to be obtained when the valves are rotated again to a closed position. As the sampler device is being brought up to the surface, a further pressure operated valve permits the bleeding of water from within the device to equalize the pressure within the device with that of the surrounding area. However the chances of having contamination in water sample is high, since the container is opened before it reaches the desired depth and the container sterility is also not ensured.<br>
In yet another US patent number 5442970 titled ‘Water sampling device1, a system for selecting a sample of water from a body of polluted water is disclosed. The sampling device includes a telescopically extendable elongated pole having a handle at a large end and a retaining member at a small end for connecting a sample receptacle thereto. The sample receptacle is open at the top and has a support member formed integral with and extending laterally from a side of the receptacle. The support member is adapted to connect the sample receptacle to the retaining member. However, it can be used only for surface waters and here also the sterility of the container is not ensured.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the proposed invention is to invent a new method and device for collecting water samples, which is unique.<br>
 <br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a method and device for collecting water samples in an economic and secure manner.<br>
It is yet another object of the proposed invention to provide a method and device for collecting water sample in pre-sterilised, single use disposable sample container and valve for un-contaminated samples wherein the valve is triggered at the desired depth.<br>
It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a water sampler device with manual triggering of filling operations, which eliminates the disadvantages in prior art i.e. susceptibility to pressure variations, jerks etc.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a water sampler device having a sterilized sample container with valve mounted on one end in a normally closed position, wherein the valve is brought to the open position by gear mechanism, comprising a pinion and rack arrangement wherein the pinion is meshed with the spindle of the valve. Therefore the valve opens only when the pinion encounters the rack, which is controlled manually by the operator. Thus the sequential opening, filling and closing operations ensures the fetching of uncontaminated samples.<br>
The further objects of the invention will be apparent from the following descriptions.<br>
The proposed device comprises a molded weight, which forms part of the body of the device, is made of concrete or any metallic or non-metallic material. To the said weight, mounting brackets and clamps are attached for fixing the sample container, valve, gear, guide, striking lever etc. The weight is connected to a cable and winch mechanism. Once triggered, the weight acts upon the gear train providing energy for the valve operating and sample filling operations. The sample container comprises a<br>
 <br>
cylinder and piston made of polypropylene or any other suitable material which is known in the art. To the spout at the closed end of the cylinder, is attached a stop cock or valve which is made of polypropylene or any suitable material. The gear, comprising a pinion and rack arrangement, is meshed with the valve arrangement and rotates the spindle of the valve, opening or closing the valve as needed. The striking lever pushes the piston in the sample container once the gear opens the valve. It disengages automatically on collecting the water sample in the cylinder. The guide guides the movement of the said striking lever engaging or disengaging the lever to the piston, as required.<br>
The device involves a method for descending the device at the required depths using cable and winch mechanism. Upon triggering from the top, the control valve is opened and the sample container is filled with the water. Once the container is full the valve is closed automatically. The sample inflow into the container is non-turbulent and keeps the sample intact for solute analysis including analysis for dissolved gases. Since the container is pre-sterilized and it is opened and closed only at the desired depth, there is no contamination in the sample from external contaminants or even from water from depths other than desired.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 depicts the embodiment of the invention used for collecting water samples.<br>
Figure 2 shows the winch mechanism used for descending the water sampling apparatus.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
 <br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. The following description and drawings are illustrative of the invention and are not to be construed as limiting the innovation. Numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However in certain instances well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
Figure 1 depicts the embodiment of the water sampling device proposed in the invention used for collecting water samples in an economic and secure manner. The said water sampling device 100 comprises two cables namely cable 1, 107 and cable 2, 108. These cables are made of a suitable material as is known in the art and used for descending the water sampling device 100 in the water bodies. Cable 1, 107 is connected with the Weight 101. Guide 104 is a thick flat strip made of stainless steel or any other non-contaminating material known in the art and used for guiding the movement of the rack102 and striking lever 103 for engaging or disengaging the lever to the piston 109, as required. The said Guide 104 is further extended and connected to a molded weight 101, which forms part of the body of the device, and the weight is made of concrete or any non-contaminating metallic or non-metallic material as known in the art. The said weight 101, consist of mounting brackets and clamps and have place to hold the sample container 105. This weight 101 which also holds the sample container 105 with the help of the mounting brackets helps the device in descending the same. This weight 101 can be increased or decreased according to the requirement considering the energy required for opening and closing of valve, moving the piston in the sample container, etc. This weight 101 is attached to a shaft which extends at one side connecting to the Cable 2,108 and extending to the other side<br>
 <br>
wherein the racks are mounted on it which whenever comes in contact with the pinion forms gear and used for opening and closing the valve 106.<br>
The said water sampling device 100 further comprises a striking lever 103 which is mounted on the shaft which is extended and connected to the Cable 2, 108. The said striking lever 103 which is engaged in the piston 109, pushes the piston 109 up once the gear 102 opens the valve 106 in order to inhale the sample water into the container 105. This striking lever 103 which is connected with the shaft is driven by the cable 2, 108 to operate the piston.<br>
The said water sampling device 100 further comprises a sample container 105, mounted on the weight 101, comprises a cylinder and piston 109 made of polypropylene or any other suitable material known in the art. The said container 105 is available as single use disposable units in pre-sterilised condition. The spout at the closed end of the cylinder is attached to a stop cock or valve 106 which is made of polypropylene or any suitable material known in the art. The gear 102, comprising a pinion and rack arrangement, is meshed with the valve arrangement and rotates the spindle of the valve, opening or closing the valve as needed.<br>
Referring to Figure 2 it explains the winch mechanism comprising a boat mountable double spindle with run length counter 202 calibrated in depth. It has a cable release and reel-in drive mechanism 203 and also trigger mechanism 201, to switch between the cable 1, 107 and cable 2, 108. The winch consists of a spindle, two cable reels, trigger mechanism 201 to engage or disengage the reels from the spindle, and a run length counter attached to reel 1 which is calibrated in terms of the total length of the cable which has rolled out. The free end of Cable 1 (107 in fig 1) is wound in to reel 1,<br>
 <br>
and the free end of cable 2 (108 in fig 1) is wound into reel 2. Using the trigger mechanism, either reel 1 or reel 2 can be engaged to the spindle, whereby the sampler 100 will be suspended from the winch by either cable 1 or cable 2 as selected manually. When the reel 1 is engaged, the sampler is lowered to the desired depth which is read on the counter 202. The drive mechanism 203 which is used to lower or raise the sampler by releasing or reeling in the cables as the case may be, can be driven either manually or by battery power. The winch mechanism can be clamped to the boat using mounting brackets.<br>
Upon reaching the desired depth, reel 1 is disengaged and reel 2 is engaged using the trigger mechanism 201, whereupon the weight of the sampler is transferred to cable 2 which in turn transfers it to the rack mechanism. Since the rack is capable of sliding over the guide plate, the weight 101 attached to the guide, pulls itself and everything fixed to it downwards. This engages the first segment in the rack with the gear wheel attached to the stop cock, rotates the gear wheel by 90 degrees and opens valve and subsequently disengages from the gear wheel leaving the stop cock in the open position. As the weight and devices attached to it slides further down under the force of gravity, the striking lever 103 locks with the piston (109 in fig 1) of the sample container whereby the piston is drawn outwards in its cylinder, inhaling water sample through the open stop cock. When the piston has moved out sufficiently and filled the sampler to the required level, the striking lever disengages from the guide plate which kept it pressing against the piston. Further movement of the piston stops at this point. As the weight slides down further, the second segment in the rack engages with the gear wheel attached to the stop cock turning it a further 90 degrees to close it. The sample filling operation is completed at this stage. Reel 2 is disengaged and reel 1 is<br>
 <br>
engaged using the trigger mechanism 201, transferring the weight of the sampler back to cable 1. The Sampler is pulled up out of water using the drive 203 (which can be either manually operated or driven by battery power). The sampler is taken out of water, laid on the boat and after releasing the mounting brackets the sample container along with the stop cock is taken out and stored in a refrigerator or chill box or any other appropriate storage device.<br>
Referring to Figure 1 and 2, the water sampling device 100 can be lowered to the required depth by the cables and winch mechanism. For descending the device, the cables are released and due to the weight 101 acting downwards the device is gradually lowered to the required depth. On reaching the required depth, which is indicated by the run length counter 202, the cable 1 is released and the cable 2 will be engaged, upon which the gravitational pull on the weight 101 acting on the cable 2 will be felt by the gear train it will be set in motion rotating the valve/stop cock by 90 degrees, thereby opening the valve, which was in a closed position initially. Thus, using cable 2 the control valve 106 is triggered open manually with the help of the gear mechanism 102, where the pinion encounters the first rack. Since the weight 101 is attached to the device, upon triggering from top, the whole weight is centered at the piston, drawing it outward in the cylinder and thereby inhaling water through the open valve. Once the container is filled, the striking lever disengages from the piston and the valve 106 gets automatically closed when it encounters the second rack mounted on the shaft. Since, the valve 106 is opened and closed by the turning action of the valve spindle; it will not be opened or closed accidentally through external pressure variations. The said weight 101 should be adequate to provide energy for the operation of the valve and for moving the piston in the cylinder of the sample container.<br>
 <br>
For instance a system using 50ml container is equipped with a weight of at least 2kg in water after buoyancy effects have been accounted for.<br>
It is another embodiment of the invention wherein the water sampling device 100 can be lowered to the required depth by the cables and winch mechanism. For descending the device, the cables are released and due to the weight 101 acting downwards the device is gradually lowered to the required depth. On reaching the required depth, which is indicated by the run length counter 202, the cable 2 is engaged. Now cable 1 is released and since the gravitational pull on the weight 101 acting on the cable 2 will be felt by the gear train and it will be set in motion, rotating the valve by 90 degrees, thereby opening the valve. Since the weight is centered at cable 2 which is connected to the striking lever which is in turn connected to the piston, it keeps the piston move upwards until it reaches its limit, thereby filling the water in the sample container. The extent of the run out difference between cable 1 and cable 2 indicates the filling of the sample container. Once the piston is moved to its extreme upwards, the valve 106 gets automatically closed, when the gear wheel attached to it encounters the second rack, mounted on the shaft. Since, the valve 106 is opened and closed by the turning action of the valve spindle, it will not be opened or closed accidentally through external pressure variations. The said weight 101 depends on the capacity of the sample container. For instance a system using 50ml container is equipped with a weight of at least 2kg net in water, after loss of weight in water due to buoyancy is accounted for.<br>
The sample inflow into the container is non-turbulent and keeps the sample intact for solute analysis including analysis for dissolved gases. Since the sample container is a cylinder and piston, it is capable of adjusting its storage volume automatically when the external pressure changes thereby equalizing the internal pressure with external<br>
 <br>
pressure when the container is lowered to or lifted from depths. Since the container is pre-sterilized and since the container is opened and closed at the desired depth itself there is no contamination of the sample from other depth layers in the water body.<br>
Once the sample container is filled it can be pulled up with the help of winch mechanism and the cables. Since the sample container is detachable it can be detached and can be taken directly to the laboratory for lab test.<br>
