				<td>A MAGNETIC COMPOSITE FOR AC APPLICATIONS<br>
AND A PROCESS FOR MANUFACTURING THE SAME<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to the field of magnetic materials, more<br>
specifically to soft or temporary magnetic composites for AC applications and to<br>
the production of the same. More particularly, it concerns a soft magnetic<br>
composite with reduced hysteresis and eddy current losses and very good<br>
mechanical properties. The magnetic composite of the invention is well suited for<br>
manufacturing power application devices such as stator or rotor of machines or<br>
parts of relays operating at frequencies up to 10 000 Hz; or chokes, inductors or<br>
transformers for frequencies up to 10 000 Hz.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Magnetic materials can be divided into two major classes: permanent magnetic<br>
materials (also referred to as hard magnetic materials) and temporary magnetic<br>
materials (also referred to as soft magnetic materials).<br>
The permanent magnets are characterized by a large remanence, so that after<br>
removal of a magnetizing force, a high flux density remains. The permanent<br>
magnets tend toward large hysteresis loops, which are the closed curves<br>
showing the variation of the magnetic induction of a magnetic material with the<br>
external magnetic field producing it when this field is changed through a<br>
complete cycle. Permanent magnets are commonly physically hard substances<br>
and are, therefore, called hard magnets.<br>
The temporary or soft magnets have low values of remanence and small<br>
hysteresis loops. They are commonly physically softer than the hard magnets<br><br>
and are known as soft magnets. Ideally, the soft magnets should have large<br>
values of permeability () up to a high saturated flux density. The value of the<br>
permeability () is the ratio B/H, where H represents the applied magnetic field,<br>
or magnetic force, expressed in amperes per meter (A/M) and B is the magnetic<br>
flux density induced in the material, and it is expressed in teslas (one tesla being<br>
equal to one weber per meter square (W/m2)).<br>
Soft magnetic materials are usually for applications where they have to canalize<br>
a varying magnetic flux. They are conventionally used for manufacturing<br>
transformers, inductance for electronic circuits, magnetic screens, stator and<br>
rotor of motors, generators, alternators, field concentrators, synchroresolver, etc.<br>
A soft magnetic material has to rapidly react to the small variations of an external<br>
inducing magnetic field, and that, without heating and without affecting the<br>
frequency of the external field.<br>
Therefore, soft magnets are usually used with alternating currents, and for<br>
maximum efficiency, it is essential to minimize the energy losses associated with<br>
the changing electric field. The energy losses, or core losses, as they are<br>
sometimes called, result in conversion of electric energy to thermal energy. The<br>
losses are usually expressed in terms of watts/kg (W/kg) for a given flux density<br>
(in teslas) at a given frequency (in Hertz). There are two principal mechanisms by<br>
which energy or core losses occur. These are hysteresis losses and eddy current<br>
losses. Soft magnetic materials have to have a small hysteresis loop (a small<br>
coercive field Hc) and a high flux density (B) at saturation.<br>
As well explained in US 6,548,012, hysteresis losses are due to the energy<br>
dissipated by the wall domain movement and they are proportional to the<br>
frequency. They are influenced by the chemical composition and the structure of<br>
the material.<br><br>
Eddy currents are induced when a magnetic field is exposed to an alternating<br>
magnetic field. These currents which travel normal to the direction of the<br>
magnetic flux lead to an energy loss through Joule (resistance) heating. Eddy<br>
current losses are expected to vary with the square of the frequency, and<br>
inversely with the resistivity. The relative importance of the eddy current losses<br>
thus depends on the electrical resistivity of the material.<br>
In prior art, soft magnetic parts for alternative current of low and medium<br>
frequency applications (between 50 Hz and 50 000 Hz) have been produced<br>
using basically two different technologies, each having their advantages and<br>
limitations.<br>
The first and widely used, since the end of the 19th century, consists of punching<br>
and stacking steel laminations. This well-known process involves material loss<br>
since scrap material is generated from notches and edges of the laminations<br>
when stamping. This material loss could be very costly with some specific alloys.<br>
This process also requires a default free roll of material of dimensions greater<br>
than the dimensions of the part to be produced. The laminations have the final<br>
geometry or a subdivision of the final geometry of the parts and can be coated<br>
with an organic and/or inorganic insulating material. Every imperfection on the<br>
laminations like edges burr decreases the stacking factor of the final part and<br>
thus its maximum induction. Also, mass production of laminations prevents<br>
design with rounded edges to help copper wire winding. Due to the planar nature<br>
of the laminations, their use limits the design of devices with 2 dimensions<br>
distribution of the magnetic field. Indeed, the field is limited to travel only in the<br>
plane of the laminations.<br>
The cost of the laminations is related to their thickness. To limit energy losses<br>
generated by eddy currents, as the magnetic field frequency of the application<br>
increases, laminations thickness must be decreased. This increases the rolling<br><br>
cost of the material and decreases the stacking factor of the final part due to<br>
imperfect surface finish of the laminations and burrs and the relative importance<br>
of the insulating coating. Laminations are thus well suited but limited to low<br>
frequency applications.<br>
The second process for the production of soft magnetic parts for AC applications,<br>
well-known since the beginning of the 20th century, is a variant of the mass<br>
production powder metallurgy process where particles used are electrically<br>
isolated from each other by a coating (US Patents 421,067; 1,669,649;<br>
1,789,477; 1,850,181; 1,859,067; 1,878,589; 2,330,590; 2,783,208; 4,543,208;<br>
5,063,011; 5,211,896). To prevent the formation of electrical contacts between<br>
the powder particles, and thus to reduce the eddy current losses, the powder<br>
particles are not sintered for AC applications. Parts issued from this process are<br>
commonly named "soft magnetic composites or SMC". Obviously, this process<br>
has the advantage of eliminating material loss.<br>
SMC are isotropic and thus offer the possibility of designing components which<br>
allow the magnetic fields to move in the three dimensions. SMC allow also the<br>
production of rounded edges with conventional powder metallurgy pressing<br>
techniques. As mentioned above, those rounded edges help winding the electric<br>
conductors. Due to the higher curvature radius of the rounded edges, the<br>
electrical conductors require less insulation. Furthermore, a reduction in the<br>
length of the conductors due to the rounded edges of the soft magnetic part is a<br>
great advantage, since it allows the amount of copper used to be minimized as<br>
well as the copper loss (loss due to the electrical resistivity of the electrical<br>
conductor carrying the current in the electromagnetic device).<br>
With rounded edges, the overall dimension of the electrical component could be<br>
reduced, since electrical winding could be partially inlaid within the volume<br>
normally occupied by the soft magnetic part. In addition, due to the isotropy of<br>
t<br><br>
the material and the gain of freedom of the pressing process, new designs that<br>
increase total yield, decrease the volume or the weight for the same power<br>
output of electric machines are possible, since a better distribution or movement<br>
of the magnetic field in the three dimensions is possible.<br>
Another advantage of the powder metallurgy process is the elimination of the<br>
clamping mean needed to secure laminations together in the final part. With<br>
laminations, clamping is sometimes replaced by a welding of the edges of<br>
laminations. Using the later approach, the eddy currents are considerably<br>
increased, and the total yield of the device or its frequency range application is<br>
decreased.<br>
The limitation of the SMC is their high hysteresis losses and low permeability<br>
compared to steel laminations. Since particles must be insulated from each other<br>
to limit eddy currents induction, there is a distributed air gap in the material that<br>
decreases significantly the magnetic permeability and increases the coercive<br>
field. Additionally, to prevent the destruction of the insulation or coating, SMC can<br>
very hardly be fully annealed or achieve a complete recrystallisation with grain<br>
coarsening. The temperatures reported for annealing SMC without loosing<br>
insulation are about 600°C in a non-reducing atmosphere and with the use of<br>
partially or totally inorganic coating (US Patents 2,230,228; 4,601,765;<br>
4,602,957; 5,595,609; 5,754,936; 6,251,514; 6,331,270 B1; PCT/SE96/00397).<br>
Although the annealing temperature commonly used is not sufficient to<br>
completely remove residual strain in the particles or to cause recrystallisation or<br>
grain growth, a substantial amelioration of the hysteresis losses is observed.<br>
Ultimately, for all the soft magnetic composites with irregular or spherical<br>
particles developed for AC applications until now, even if residual strain would<br>
have been removed and grain growth would have been possible at temperatures<br>
used for the annealing cycle of finished parts, metallic grain dimension is limited<br><br>
to the size of the particles. This small grain size limits the possibility of increasing<br>
the permeability, decreasing the coercive field or simply, the hysteresis losses in<br>
the material. Indeed, the smaller the metallic grains are, the higher is the number<br>
of grain boundaries, and more energy is required for moving the magnetic<br>
domain walls and increasing the induction of the material in one direction.<br>
Therefore, the resulting total energy losses (or core losses) of SMC parts at low<br>
frequency (below 400Hz) is greater than the total energy losses obtained with<br>
laminations. The low permeability values require also more copper wire to<br>
achieve the same induction or torque in the electromagnetic device. An optimized<br>
three dimensions and rounded winding edges design of the part made with the<br>
SMC with irregular or spherical particles can partially or completely compensate<br>
those higher hysteresis losses and low permeability values encountered with<br>
SMC material at low frequency.<br>
Some attempts have been made to develop more performing inorganic coatings<br>
and processes for conventional soft magnetic composites that would allow a full<br>
annealing of compacts and even recrystallisation without losing too much<br>
electrical insulation between particles (US Patents 2,937,964; 5,352,522;<br>
EP 0 088 992 A2; WO 02/058865). These prior art documents teach a heat<br>
treatment at around 1000°C or less to consolidate particles by the diffusion or<br>
interaction of the insulating material of each particle. In all these cases, the goal<br>
is to produce a soft magnetic composite with discontinuous, separated soft<br>
magnetic particles joined by a continuous electrical insulating medium. The DC<br>
magnetic properties (coercive field and maximum permeability) of the produced<br>
composite are far inferior to those of the main wrought soft magnetic constituting<br>
material in the form of lamination, and thus, hysteresis losses in an AC magnetic<br>
field are higher and the electrical current or the number of turns of copper wire<br>
required to reach the same torque must be higher. Properties of those<br>
composites are well suited for applications frequency above 10 KHz to 1 MHz. If<br>
power frequencies are targeted (US Patents EP 0 088 992 A2 and<br><br>
WO 02/058865), the design of the component must compensate for the lower<br>
permeability and higher hysteresis losses of the material.<br>
Finally, some people who have discovered the benefit of using lamellar particles<br>
for doing soft magnetic components have developed coating able to sustain<br>
annealing temperature, that is to say temperatures which are high enough to<br>
remove the major part of the remaining strain in the parts (US Patents 3,255,052;<br>
3,848,331; 4,158,580; 4,158,582; 4,265,681). Once again, magnetic properties<br>
and energetic losses in an AC magnetic field at frequencies under 400Hz are not<br>
those reached with good lamination steel or silicon steel used commercially,<br>
since metallic diffusion between soft magnetic particles is avoided to keep high<br>
electrical resistivity in the composite.<br>
Since all the actual soft magnetic composite are discontinuous metallic media,<br>
the mechanical strength of the material is limited to the strength of the insulating<br>
coating. When the material breaks, it is de-cohesion that occurs between metallic<br>
particles, in the organic or inorganic (vitrous/ceramic) coating. The mechanical<br>
behavior of the SMC is thus fragile with no possibility of plastic deformation and<br>
the strength is always far lower than that of metallurgically bonded materials. It is<br>
an important limitation of the SMC.<br>
Also known in the prior art are the sintered iron non coated powder components<br>
currently used to make parts for DC magnetic applications. These sintered parts<br>
have low resistivity and are generally not used in AC applications. In the literature<br>
or patents, when sintering treatments (metal to metal) or metallic diffusion are<br>
involved, soft magnetic parts produced are for DC applications where eddy<br>
currents are not a concern (US Patents 4,158,581; 5,594,186; 5,925,836;<br>
6,117,205 for example) or for non-magnetic applications like structural parts.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a magnetic composite for AC<br>
application, having improved magnetic properties (i.e. lower hysteresis and eddy<br>
current losses).<br>
In accordance with the present invention, this object is achieved with a magnetic<br>
composite for AC applications, comprising a consolidation of magnetizable<br>
metallic microlamellar particles each having top and bottom surfaces and<br>
opposite ends. The top and bottom surfaces are coated with a dielectric coating<br>
for increasing the resistivity of the composite and reducing eddy current losses.<br>
The composite is characterized in that the coating is made of a refractory<br>
material and the ends of the lamellar particles are metallurgically bonded to each<br>
other to reduce hysteresis losses of the composite.<br>
By metallurgically bonded, it is meant a metallic joint involving a metallic diffusion<br>
between the particles, obtained by sintering or forging or any other process<br>
allowing a metallic diffusion between the particles. In accordance with a first<br>
preferred embodiment, the metallurgically bonded ends are obtained by heating<br>
the consolidation of particles to a temperature of at least 800°C, more preferably,<br>
above 1000°C. In accordance with a second preferred embodiment, the<br>
metallurgically bonded ends are obtained by forging the consolidation.<br>
By refractory material, it is meant a material capable of withstanding the effects<br>
of high temperature. Preferably, the coating is made of a material stable at a<br>
temperature of at least 1000°C.<br>
The magnetic composite is preferably a soft magnetic composite having a<br>
coercive force of less than 500 A/m.<br>
In order to increase the resistivity of the composite, and thus reduce its eddy<br>
current losses when it is under the effect of an alternating magnetic field, the<br><br>
coating is also dielectric. Since the dielectric material is a refractory, it prevents<br>
formation of metallic contacts (metallurgic bonds) between each top and bottom<br>
surfaces of particles during the thermal treatment and keep a certain electrical<br>
insulation. In that sense, this refractory material acts as a diffusion barrier for<br>
each top and bottom surfaces of particles. The sintering or metallurgical bonding<br>
is thus preferential.<br>
The diffusion barrier or coating could be, for example, but it is not limited to, a<br>
metal oxide like silicon, titanium, aluminum, magnesium, zirconium, chromium,<br>
boron oxide and their combinations and all other oxides stable at a temperature<br>
above 1000°C under a reducing atmosphere, of a thickness between 0.01 urn to<br>
10 urn, more preferably between 0.05pm and 2pm. The microlamellar particles<br>
are preferably made of a metallic material containing at least one of Fe, Ni and<br>
CO. More preferably, they are made of a material selected from the group<br>
consisting of pure iron, iron alloys, pure nickel, nickel alloys, iron-nickel alloys,<br>
pure cobalt, cobalt alloys, iron-cobalt alloys and iron-nickel-cobalt alloys. Also<br>
preferably, the microlamellar particles have a thickness (e) in the range of 15 to<br>
150 rn, and have a length-to-thickness ratio greater than 3 and lower than 200.<br>
The magnetic composite according to the invention preferably has an energy loss<br>
when tested according to the ASTM standard A-773, A-927 for a toroid of at least<br>
4 mm thickness in an AC electromagnetic field of 1 Tesla and a frequency of 60<br>
Hz of less than 2W/kg.<br>
Also preferably, the magnetic composite shows the following magnetic and<br>
mechanical properties:<br>
- a coercive force of less than 100 A/m, preferably less than 50 A/m, and more<br>
preferably less than 25 A/m;<br><br>
a DC magnetic permeability of at least 1000, preferably at least 2500, and<br>
more preferably at least 5000;<br>
a transverse rupture strength of at least 125 MPa, preferably at least 500 MPa;<br>
and<br>
a plastic deformation zone like during mechanical testing (due to slow<br>
delamination of particles).<br>
The present invention is also directed to a process of manufacturing a magnetic<br>
composite comprising the steps of:<br>
a)	providing microlamellar particles made of a magnetizable metallic<br>
material, the particles having opposite ends and a top and bottom surfaces, the<br>
top and bottom surfaces being coated with a dielectric and refractory coating;<br>
b)	compacting the microlamellar particles into a predetermined shape for<br>
obtaining a consolidation of the microlamellar particles; and<br>
c)	metallurgically bonding the ends of the microlamellar particles to each<br>
other.<br>
Preferably, step c) of metallurgically bonding comprises the step of: heating the<br>
consolidation at a temperature sufficient to sinter the ends of the microlamellar<br>
particles.<br>
The temperature sufficient to sinter is preferably at least 800°C; more preferably<br>
it is at least 1000°C.<br>
Alternatively, step c) of metallurgically bonding comprises the step of: forging the<br>
consolidation.<br><br>
The microlamellar particles are preferably obtained by:<br>
a1) providing a foil of the magnetizable material having a thickness of less<br>
than about 150um, the foil having a top and bottom surface coated with the<br>
dielectric and refractory coating; and<br>
a2) cutting the microlamellar particles from the foil.<br>
The diffusion barrier or coating material on the top and bottom surfaces of the<br>
microlamellar particles is obtained by a coating process adapted to produce a<br>
coating having a thickness of less than 10um. Preferably, it is made by a<br>
deposition technique (a physical vapor deposition (PVD) or chemical vapor<br>
deposition (CVD) process, plasma enhanced or not, or by dipping or spraying<br>
using a process such as the sol-gel process or the thermal decomposition of an<br>
oxide precursor, a surface reaction process (oxidation, phosphatation, salt bath<br>
reaction) or a combination of both (dipping the foil or particles into a liquid<br>
aluminum or magnesium bath, the CVD, PVD, Magnetron sputtering process of a<br>
pure metal coating and a chemical or thermo-chemical treatment to oxidize the<br>
coating formed during an additional step).<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Referring to figures 1a, 1b, or figure 4 which shows a typical stator (2) for an AC<br>
application that could be made with the composite of the invention, a magnetic<br>
composite (10) according to the invention consists of a consolidation of<br>
magnetizable metallic microlamellar particles (12) each having a top and bottom<br>
surfaces and opposite ends (14). The top and bottom surfaces are coated with a<br>
dielectric coating (16) for increasing the resistivity of the composite (10) and<br>
reducing eddy current losses. The composite (10) is characterized in that the<br>
coating (16) is made of a refractory material and the lamellar particles (12) are<br>
metallurgically bonded by their ends (14) to reduce hysteresis losses of the<br>
composite (10).<br>
The present invention covers the production process and the material that takes<br>
profit of the best properties of the two already existing technologies (i.e.<br>
lamination stacking and soft magnetic composite). The material produced with<br>
this technology can be fully sintered or forged to achieve good mechanical<br>
properties and excellent AC soft magnetic properties at frequencies comprised<br>
between 1 and 10 000Hz. In order to reduce hysteresis losses of the final part,<br><br>
and thus helping to reduce low frequency total losses of the part, the lamellar<br>
particles have their ends sintered, or metallurgically bonded, to each other.<br>
Losses at low frequencies are as low as for a lamination stacking. Losses at<br>
higher-frequencies are also low since eddy currents are limited by the use of very<br>
thin lamellar particles (0.0005 to 0.002" or 12.5 to 50 n). Even if electrical<br>
insulation is not total between particles, eddy currents are limited to only two or<br>
three layers of particles at zone with poor insulations (edges of particles) since,<br>
statistically, insulation defects are rarely aligned and are not aligned for more<br>
than few layers. The result is a composite material with total losses at<br>
frequencies varying between 0 and 400 Hz that are similar to those of a<br>
lamination stack made with the best grades of silicon steel (3.5 W/kg at 60 Hz<br>
1.5T). Mechanical properties of this composite, when forged, are well above all<br>
composites previously developed with Transverse Rupture Strength1 values of<br>
125 000 psi (875 MPa) without plastic deformation followed by a deformation<br>
zone (de-lamination) with a stable resistance of 65 000 psi (450 MPa). A<br>
composite according to the invention, when only sintered on a reducing<br>
atmosphere rather than forged, has TRS value in the same range as that of the<br>
best mechanically resistant soft magnetic composite containing a reticulated<br>
(cured) resin (18 000 psi, 125 MPa) (Gelinas, C. et al. "Effect of curing conditions<br>
on properties of iron-resin materials for low frequency AC magnetic applications",<br>
Metal Powder Industries Federation, Advances in Powder Metallurgy &amp;<br>
Particulate Materials - 1998; Volume 2, Parts 5-9 (USA), pp. 8.3-8.11, June<br>
1999). Contrary to previous soft magnetic composites developed, which all have<br>
a fragile comportment without any plastic deformation before complete rupture,<br>
the sintered or forged composite of the present invention shows a plastic<br>
deformation zone like or ductile comportment during mechanical testing. This<br>
comportment is due to a slow de-lamination of the composite.<br>

Extra design liberty given by the process used to make a composite according to<br>
the invention (powder metallurgy allows design in three dimensions, lamination<br>
stacking is limited in a plane) allows to decrease the total losses of an<br>
electromagnetic device made with the composite of the invention (including<br>
copper losses) compared to losses generated by the same component made<br>
with a lamination stack. Volume and weight can also be decreased importantly<br>
with the composite of the invention. As the frequency of the application increases<br>
(above 500 Hz), conventional soft magnetic components made with irregular<br>
particles, or thin microlamellar particles fully insulated from each other and not<br>
sintered, can develop lower total losses due to their better limitation of eddy<br>
current losses even if hysteresis losses are higher due to distributed air gap.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED MODE OF REALIZATION<br>
A composite for soft magnetic application (ex: transformers, stator and rotor of<br>
motors, generators, alternators, a field concentrator, a synchroresolver, etc..) in<br>
accordance with the invention is preferably realized by:<br>
•	Using pure iron, iron nickel alloys (with nickel content varying from 20 to<br>
85%) which may also contain up to 20% Cr, less than 5 % of Mo, less than<br>
5 % of Mn; silicon iron with a minimal contain of 80% of iron and with<br>
silicon content between 0 and 10%, that may contain less than 10% of Mo,<br>
less than 10% of Mn and less than 10% of Cr; iron cobalt alloys with<br>
cobalt content varying from 0 to 100% and that may contain less than 10%<br>
of Mo, less than 10% of Mn, less than 10% of Cr, and less than 10% of<br>
silicon; or finally, Fe-Ni-Co alloys at all content of Ni and Co that may<br>
contain a maximum of 20% of other alloying elements.<br>
•	Using the pre-cited materials (or alloys) in the form of foils of a thickness<br>
between 10m and 500m, preferably under 125pm, more preferably<br><br>
under 50m, coated one or both sides with a very thin electrical insulating<br>
inorganic, heat resistant oxide of a thickness between 0.01 rn to 2m like<br>
silicon, titanium, aluminum, magnesium, zirconium, chromium, boron<br>
oxide and their combinations and all other oxides stable over 1000°C<br>
under a reducing atmosphere.<br>
• The foil is obtained from a standard hot and cold rolling process<br>
starting or not from a strip casting process and including or not<br>
some normalizing or full annealing stages during rolling (semi<br>
processed electrical steel or silicon steel or fully processed<br>
electrical or silicon steel or all other alloys sub-mentioned by rolling)<br>
or obtained by casting alloys sub-mentioned on a cooled rotating<br>
wheel (melt spinning, planar flow casting, strip casting, melt drag)<br>
no matter the width produced. The semi-processed steel or silicon<br>
steel could be decarburized prior to receiving the coating or after. A<br>
grain coarsening treatment (secondary recristallisation) to achieve<br>
optimal magnetic properties could have also been done prior to<br>
coating when possible.<br>
• The coating is obtained directly by dipping the foil into a liquid<br>
aluminum or magnesium bath, by a physical vapor deposition<br>
(PVD) or chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process, plasma<br>
enhanced or not, or by dipping or spraying using a process such as<br>
the sol-gel process or any process, involving the thermal<br>
decomposition of an oxide precursor. The CVD, PVD, Magnetron<br>
sputtering process could give directly an oxide layer or could give a<br>
pure metal coating like with the dipping of the foil into a metal bath.<br>
The pure metal coating, in those cases, has to be oxidized during a<br>
subsequent process.<br><br>
•	Doing a grain coarsening thermal treatment at high temperature under<br>
reducing atmosphere on the coated foil to optimize its magnetic properties<br>
if the starting foil was not magnetically optimal.<br>
•	Cutting the pre-cited foil coated and thermally treated or thermally treated<br>
and coated in the form of lamellar particles or flakes. Dicing or slitting and<br>
cutting the coated thin foils could give those flakes.<br>
•	An alternative process gives flakes directly from more spherical powders<br>
(produced by another way like water or gaz atomization) by hot or cold<br>
rolling the powders or by the melt drag process with a dented wheel<br>
(machined with a lot of small grooves) to extract flakes from the melted<br>
metal or from an atomization process like rotary electrode or disk where<br>
the melted particles hit a wall or a hammer before solidifying. Flakes could<br>
be made finally by cutting a ribbon coming from a machining process. In<br>
all those last cases, the coating is applied directly on the lamellar particles,<br>
rather than on the ribbons to be cut and all edges are coated.<br>
•	Mixing 0.1 to 1% by weight of lubricant with the pre-cited coated lamellar<br>
powders or flakes to help the following pressing process. The lubricant<br>
could also be applied by any process directly on the foil prior to its cutting<br>
to produce lamellar particles.<br>
Filling at least one pre-filling die with the lamellar particles. The pre-filling<br>
die could be sited on a vibrating table during the filling. A magnetic field<br>
could also be applied during the filling to orientate the flakes. The pre-<br>
filling die could be separated in two or three heights. After a light pressing<br>
(0,1 MPa to 10 MPa ), only the third or the two thirds of the initial height of<br>
the pre-filling die could be conserved for the powder transfer to the<br>
production press. Such pre-pressing is to increase their apparent density,<br><br>
to help the orientation of the flakes perpendicular to the pressing axe and<br>
to accelerate subsequent filling of the die of the production press.<br>
Sometimes during the filling of the pre-filling operation or after, a pressure<br>
in the range of 0,1 MPa to 10MPa could be applied.<br>
• Transferring the powder from the pre-filling die (or one part of its initial<br>
height) to the pressing die with the help of a synchronized movement of<br>
the upper punch and the lower punch of the press. The upper punch<br>
pressure could come from an external temporary punch (the same as the<br>
one used for the pre-filling die light compression for example) rather than<br>
the punch of the production press. The movement of the lower punch is a<br>
common feature during the filling of the press and is commonly named<br>
"suction filling".<br>
•	Pressing the part with the main press with the use of an increase of<br>
temperature or not. The consolidation process could be a cold, warm or<br>
hot uniaxial process or isostatic process (cold or hot).<br>
•	Sintering the compacted part to allow the formation of metal to metal<br>
contacts. Mechanical and magnetic properties are appreciably increased<br>
during the sintering process at a temperature above 1000 °C for at least 5<br>
minutes. An assembling of many different parts could be sintered to obtain<br>
a bigger or a more complex rigid part.<br>
• Alternatively, rather than sintering, compressed parts could be pre-heated<br>
to above 1000°C and forged to achieve near full density. An assembling Of<br>
many different parts could be forged simultaneously to give a rigid part.<br>
•	Alternatively, a repressing could be done on sintered parts to increase<br>
density.<br><br>
•	A final anneal or another sintering treatment (double press-double sinter<br>
process) could be done if a repressing step is done on the parts.<br>
•	If additional machining operations are required, a final anneal could be<br>
done on the parts to obtain the optimum magnetic properties.<br>
•	Final parts could be dipped into a liquid polymer or metal or alloy to<br>
increase their mechanical properties and avoid the detachment of some<br>
lamellar particles on the surface of the parts. Any surface treatment could<br>
also be done to modify the surface of the parts.<br>
• The final part pressed and sintered or forged could be submitted to the<br>
following treatments. Those following treatments are given as an example<br>
but possible treatments are not limited to those following examples. Final<br>
parts could be infiltrated with one or more metals and alloys during a<br>
subsequent heat treatment to increase their mechanical properties, wear<br>
and corrosion resistance. Parts could also be infiltrated by an organic<br>
material to improve mechanical, wear or chemical resistance. Final parts<br>
could also be thermal sprayed or be submitted to many other forms of<br>
surface treatment.<br>
The metallography of the product combined with its magnetic properties (relative<br>
permeability well above 1000) and mechanical properties (transverse rupture<br>
strength (MPIF standard 41)) over 18 000 psi (125 MPa) is specific. In fact,<br>
metallography of figure 1 clearly shows the flaky nature of the composite and the<br>
properties reported in table 1 below testify of its sintering or metallurgic bonds<br>
between particles. Furthermore, the properties of the part are not modified by<br>
heating it in a reducing atmosphere at 1000°C for 15 minutes, testifying that its<br>
mechanical resistance does not come from an organic reticulated resin like for<br>
the most mechanically resistant actual soft magnetic composite, and showing<br><br>
that its electrical resistivity, evaluated from the slope of the curve on the graph of<br>
its energetic losses as a function of the frequency varying from 10 to 250 Hz in a<br>
field of 1 or 1.5 Tesla (figures 2 and 3), is conserved (low eddy current losses)<br>
even after a reducing treatment and a beginning of sintering contrarily of all other<br>
soft magnetic composites.<br>
Figures 1a and 1b show examples of the metallography of a sintered<br>
microlamellar or flaky soft magnetic composite according to two preferred<br>
embodiments of the invention (Sintered Flaky Soft magnetic composite SF-<br>
SMC). Table 1 and figures 2 and 3 show typical magnetic properties of the<br>
sintered flaky soft magnetic composite.<br>
EXAMPLES:<br>
The following properties and energetic losses (Figures 1 and 2 and table 1)<br>
were measured on standard toroid specimens of 6 mm (sintered) and 4 mm<br>
(forged) thickness for the SF-SMC and results are compared to some<br>
common laminations (silicon steel 0.35 mm thick laminations, electrical steel<br>
0.6 mm thick laminations) or soft magnetic composites (SMC and Krause for<br>
patent 4,265,681) of approximately the same thickness. The new material is<br>
identified as "SF-SMC" (Sintered Flaky-Soft Magnetic Composite)<br>
Example 1: The process used to do the rings for which results are reported on<br>
table 1 (SF-SMC FeNi sintered) and figure 2 at an induction of 1.0 Tesla is the<br>

A part of the same dimensions made with uncoated laminations gave 6 times the<br>
losses at 60 Hz and 8 times the losses at 260 Hz.<br>
Example 3: The process used to do the rings which results are reported on<br>
Table 1 (SF-SMC Fe-3%Si sintered) is the following:<br>
• Ribbons of iron containing 3% of silicon are produced by the technology of<br>
Planar Flow Casting (The melt product is directly poured on a high speed<br>
rotating wheel).<br>
• The 50 m thick ribbon is coated with a spray of a Sol-Gel solution made<br>
with aluminum isopropoxyde and dried by reaching 150°C in a continuous<br>
process.<br><br>
•	The coated ribbon is annealed under pure hydrogen at 1200 °C during<br>
2 hours and cooled to room temperature slowly.<br>

metallurgy compacting press) and cold pressed at 60 tons per square inch<br>
(827 Mpa) of compacting pressure. Compact is ejected.<br>
•	The compact is then sintered in a conventional sintering furnace including<br>
a delubbing zone, a high temperature zone at 1120°C and a cooling zone.<br>
The time at 1120°C is approximately 10 minutes. The part is cooled<br>
approximately at 20°C/min.<br>
