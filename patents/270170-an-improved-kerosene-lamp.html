				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to an improved kerosene lamp.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
It is known to provide a kerosene lamp. However, the same is associated with distinct disadvantages of causing less illumination, which is not sufficient enough. To overcome the disadvantages, fluorescent lamp, mercury lamp etc have come in use, but the same requires electricity to be operational, which makes it expensive.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to propose an improved kerosene lamp, which is cheaper.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose an improved kerosene lamp, the use of which causes minimum pollution due to use of less fuel.Still another object of the present invention is to propose an improved kerosene lamp, which provides light of higher intensity nearly double as that of known art and which is simple in construction.<br>
STATEMENT OF INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided an improved kerosene lamp comprising of a kerosene pot fitted with a burner plate provided with a burner and a plurality of holes for the supply of oxygen, the kerosene pot is disposed inside a water tank provided with a plurality of holes for the supply of water there through, the water tank is fitted with a glass comprising of a single layered and double layered glass.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Further objects and advantages of this invention will be more apparent from the ensuing description when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and wherein:<br>
Fig. 1 shows: perspective view of the lamp of present invention.<br>
Fig. 2 shows: the different parts of the present invention<br>
Fig. 3 shows: the three dimension view of double layered glass.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION WITH REFERENCE TO ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS.<br>
Fig 1 shows the perspective view of the improved kerosene lamp. Referring to fig. 2A, an egg shaped double layered glass (2) separated by a gap is joined with a single layered glass to form upper part of the lamp. The egg shaped double layered glass is provided with at least one hole on both sides so as to facilitate pouring of water therethrough. The double layered glass is joined with a hollow cylindrical shaped glass (3) provided with a slot (4) on one side and a plurality of holes For the supply of oxygen.<br>
Referring to fig 2B, a burner plate (5) is provided for causing illumination, which comprises of a plurality of holes (6) along its circumference for the supply of oxygen. The plate is disposed with burner thread (7) and an adjustable means (8) as shown in fig. Further, the same is having a lower part (9) with threads so that,<br>
it can be accommodated in the hole (10) on the top of the kerosene pot as shown in fig. 2C, The kerosene pot comprises of an inlet (11) for kerosene and a lower extended and threaded part (12) so as to tighten the pot inside the hole (13) of the water tank, which is also threaded from inside as shown in fig 2D. The water tank is disposed with a plurality of holes (14) along its circumference, through which water can be supplied to the tank. The water tank is having a dip circle canal (15) for fitting the glass (as shown in fig. 1) therein and at least four clips (16) to hold the glass tightly.<br>
Fig .3 shows the inner portion of the double layered glass.<br>
The water tank and the double layered glass are filled with water before use.<br>
It is to be noted that the present invention is susceptible to modifications, adaptations and changes by those skilled in the art. Such variant embodiments employing the concepts and features of this invention are intended to be within the scope of the present invention, which is further set forth under the following claims:-<br><br><br><br>
WE CLAIM<br>
1.	An improved kerosene lamp comprising of a kerosene pot fitted with a<br>
burner plate provided with a burner and a plurality of holes for the<br>
suppty of oxygen, the kerosene pot is disposed inside a water tank<br>
provided with a plurality of holes for the supply of water there through,<br>
the water tank is fitted with a glass comprising of a single layered and<br>
double layered glass,<br>
2.	An improved kerosene lamp as claimed in claim 1 wherein the kerosene<br>
pot is provided with an inlet for the supply of kerosene there through<br>
and the water tank is provided with a plurality of clips for holding the<br>
glass.<br>
3.	An improved kerosene lamp as claimed in claim 1 or 2 wherein the lower<br>
portion of the glass is for example cylindrical in shape provided with a<br>
slot to accommodate an adjustable means attached with lower part of<br>
the burner plate and a plurality of holes for the supply of oxygen.<br>
4.	An improved kerosene lamp  substantially as herein described with reference to accompanying drawings.<br></td>
