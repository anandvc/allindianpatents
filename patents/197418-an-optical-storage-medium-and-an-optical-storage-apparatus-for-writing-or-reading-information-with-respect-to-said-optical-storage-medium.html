				<td>NEAR-FIELD OPTICAL STORAGE MEDIUM AND OPTICAL DATA STORAGE SYSTEM THEREFOR<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a near-field optical storage medium and an optical data storage system having a focusing optical system, and more particularly, to an optical storage medium which is used together with an optical pickup having a near-field focusing optical system such as a solid-state immersion optical system or a solid-state immersion lens, and a near-field optical data storage system for performing writing and/or reading of information with respect to the optical storage medium.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
In an optical data storage system, an optical pickup having a solid-state immersion optical system or solid-state immersion lens performs writing and/or reading of information with respect to the optical data storage system, using a near-field formed between the solid-state immersion optical system or solid-state immersion lens and the optical data storage system.<br>
FIGs. 1 and 2 show an existing optical disc used as an optical data storage system, in which FIG. 1 shows that an existing optical disc is used together with the optical data storage system having a catadioptric solid state immersion optical system, and FIG. 2 shows that an existing optical disc is used together with an optical data storage system having a refractive type solid-state immersion lens.<br><br>
In FIG. 1, a light beam 1 emitted from a light transmission and reception portion 10 is reflected by a reflective mirror 12 and incident to a catadioptric solid-state immersion optical system 14. A slider 16 supporting the solid-state immersion optical system 14 floats the solid-state immersion optical system aerodynamically through an air bearing generated by a relative movement between an optical data storage medium 18 such as an optical disc and the slider 16. As a result, an air gap is formed between the solid-state immersion optical system 14 and a protective layer 183 of the optical data storage medium 18. An interval of the air gap, that is, a distance between the opposing surfaces of the solid-state immersion optical system 14 and the optical data storage medium 18, is maintained for example within one wavelength of light used. It is preferable that it is maintained much smaller than one wavelength of the used light. The catadioptric solid-state immersion optical system 14 refracts and reflects the light beam 1 incident from the reflective mirror 12, and forms a beam spot focused on its surface opposing the optical data storage medium 18. The beam spot forms a near field in the air gap between the solid-state immersion optical system 14 and the surface of the optical storage medium 18.<br>
The optical data storage system shown in FIG. 2 includes a focusing objective lens 24 and a refractive solid-state immersion lens 26, rather than the catadioptric solid-state immersion optical system 14 shown in FIG. 1. A light transmission and reception portion 20 emits a light beam 1 having an optimized diameter for the objective lens 24. A reflective mirror 22 reflects the light beam 1 emitted from the light transmission and reception<br><br>
portion 20 toward the objective lens 24. The objective lens 24 focuses the light beam 1 incident from the reflective mirror 22 on the solid-state immersion lens 26. The beam spot focused on the solid-state immersion lens 26 forms a near field between the surface opposing the optical storage medium 18 and a protective layer 183 in the optical storage medium 18. The objective lens 24 and the solid-state immersion lens 26 are supported by a slider 28. The slider 28 floats the solid-state immersion lens 26 aerodynamically and forms an air gap having an interval within one wavelength of light used between the solid-state immersion lens 26 and the optical storage medium 18, like the slider 16 shown in FIG. 1.<br>
In the optical data storage system shown in FIG. 1 or 2, a beam spot is formed in a near field generating portion being a predetermined position on the surface of the solid-state immersion optical system 14 or the solid-state immersion lens 26 which opposes the optical storage medium 18. In general, the system shown in FIG. 1 or 2 uses a finite beam spot corresponding to a numerical aperture (NA) of at least one for writing or reading information with respect to the optical storage medium 18. In the case that used light has a wavelength A. of 650nm, a light beam which forms a beam spot on the near field generating portion passes an air gap of an interval of approximately 110nm and a protective layer 183 of 70-90nm thick, and transferred to a recording layer of the optical storage medium 18. The recording layer is disposed between the protective layer 183 of the optical storage medium 18 and a substrate 181. The light beam reflected from the recording layer transmits through the protective layer 183 and the air gap and is transferred to the solid-state immersion optical system or the<br><br>
solid-state immersion lens 26.<br>
Generally, according to the refraction and total reflection laws, the light<br>
contributed to a large numerical aperture is totally reflected from the emission<br>
surface of the  solid-state  immersion  optical  system  14  or the  solid-state<br>
immersion lens 26, that is, the near field generating portion being an optical<br>
transmitting surface adjacent to the storage medium 18.    Therefore, in the<br>
case that the interval of the air gap is larger than the wavelength   A  of the<br>
used light, the optical storage medium 18 is positioned in the portion beyond<br>
the near field.    Thus, the light contributed to the large numerical aperture<br>
does not contribute to formation  of the beam spot on the optical  storage<br>
medium   18.     In   other  words,  the  numerical  aperture  of the  light  beam<br>
contributed to the formation of the beam spot on the optical storage medium<br>
18  becomes   smaller  than   "1",  while  passing  through  the  air gap.     As  a<br>
result, a spot size of the light beam focused on the storage medium 18 with<br>
the light travelling through the air gap having an interval larger than the<br>
wavelength   of  the   used   light,   becomes   larger  than  the   beam   spot   size<br>
formed  on   the  near  field  generating   portion  of the  solid-state  immersion<br>
optical  system  14 or the  solid-state immersion lens 26.     However, in the<br>
case that an interval of the air gap is sufficiently smaller than one wavelength<br>
of the used light, preferably  /4, the spot size of the light beam incident to<br>
the optical storage medium 18 is close to the size of the beam spot formed<br>
in   the   near  field   generating  portion.     Therefore,  under  this   condition,   the<br>
optical   data   storage   system   shown   in   FIG.   1   or   2   can   write   or   read<br>
information at high density with respect to the recording layer of the optical<br>
storage medium  18, using the solid-state immersion optical system 14 or the<br><br>
solid-state immersion lens 26.<br>
FIG. 3 shows the near field generating portion between the surface of the solid-state immersion optical system 14 or the solid-state immersion lens 26 and the protective layer 183 of the optical storage medium 18. The interval SRD from the surface of the solid-state immersion optical system 14 or the solid-state immersion lens 26 opposing the optical storage medium 18 to the protective layer 183, more accurately, to the recording layer becomes smaller than one wavelength of the used light, and the recording layer in the storage medium 18 is positioned within the distance providing a near field effect.<br>
An example of an existing optical disc is disclosed in U. S. patent No. 5,470,627. In the case that the above existing optical disc is for example a magnetooptical disc, the disc includes a reflective layer, a first dielectric layer, a recording layer, and a second dielectric layer which are disposed on a conventional substrate in sequence. The reflective layer is made of metal such as aluminum of 500-1000 A thick. The first dielectric layer is made of aluminum nitride or silicon nitride of 150-400 A thick. The recording layer is made of rare-earth transition-metal alloy such as TbFeCo of 150-500A thick. Finally, the protective layer is made of silicon nitride Si3N4 of 400-800A thick. However, in the case that the above-described existing optical disc is used, the optical data storage system has two problems as follows. These problems take place identically in both the data storage system including the<br>
•*<br>
solid-state immersion optical system 14 and the data storage system including the solid-state immersion lens 26. Therefore, for convenience of explanation, these problems will be described in connection with the existing<br><br>
optical disc and the solid-state immersion lens 26.<br>
First, the problem that the light beam reflected from the recording layer<br>
on the existing optical disc having the above structure contains noise due to<br>
interference will be described with reference to FIGs. 4 and 5.   FIG. 4 shows<br>
the solid-state immersion lens 26 having a refractive index of 1.8.    In FIG.<br>
4, "air gap reflective light (NB)" illustrates the light beam totally reflected<br>
from the near field generating portion of the solid-state immersion lens 26<br>
and the air gap between the solid-state immersion lens 26 and the optical<br>
storage medium 18, and "recording layer reflective light (RB)" illustrates the<br>
light beam reflected from the recording layer in the optical storage medium<br>
18.     In the case that the  solid-state immersion  lens 26 has a refractive<br>
index  of  1.8,  the  total  reflective angle of 56.3  degree at the solid-state<br>
immersion lens 26 corresponds to the numerical aperture of 0.83.    FIG. 5<br>
shows angle-reflectance characteristics of the solid-state immersion optical<br>
system 14 or the solid-state immersion lens 26 with respect to three air gap<br>
intervals.    In FIG. 5, curves (a) show angle-reflectance characteristics with<br>
respect to the air gap interval of 50nm, curves (b) show angle-reflectance<br>
characteristics with respect to the air gap interval of 100nm, and curves (c)<br>
show angle-reflectance characteristics with respect to the air gap interval of<br>
150nm.     Among  the curves  (a) through  (c),  the curves  denoted as "++"<br>
show angle-reflectance characteristics    with respect to the p-polarized light<br>
beam,   and   the  curves   denoted   as   "—"(solid   line)   show   angle-reflectance<br>
characteristics   with   respect   to   the   s-polarized   light   beam.      The   angle<br>
denoted at the horizontal axis indicates an incident angle possessed by the<br>
light beam proceeding to the air gap from the solid-state immersion lens 26.<br>
For example, in the case that an interval of the air gap existing between the optical storage medium 18 and the solid-state immersion lens 26 becomes larger than the wavelength of the used light, the portion of the light beam having an angle larger than the total reflection angle of 56.3 degree, particularly the portion of the light beam contributed to a higher numerical aperture, for example, the numerical aperture of 1.2 or more among the light beam proceeding from the solid-state immersion lens 26 to the storage medium 18, does not transmit the air gap, but is totally reflected in the near field generating portion or in the inside of the air gap. As can be seen from FIG. 5 showing a reflectance with respect to the numerical aperture of 1.5, the air gap reflective light NB has a relatively higher reflectance. Also, since the air gap and the recording layer are very close to each other, an interference occurs between the air gap reflective light (NB) and the recording layer reflective light (RB). Finally, the air gap reflective light (NB) functions as noise with respect to the recording layer reflective light (RB).<br>
Now, the problem caused by the optical storage medium 18 which is made at high density will be described with reference to FIG. 6. In the case that the optical storage medium 18 is fabricated into a high density optical storage medium, grooves or pits of 100-150nm wide are formed on a substrate 181 for recording information thereon. A reflective layer or a recording layer on which information is actually recorded are in turn put on the grooves or pits, through a coating process. In addition, a protective layer 183 of 150-200nm thick is formed on the recording layer. In FIG. 6, an uncvenness structure 185 formed as the grooves or pits on the substrate<br>
181 is shown in the form of a wedge or well. Since the depth of the recording layer coated by the protective layer 183 is larger than the width of the grooves or pits, the light beam lincident from the solid-state immersion optical system 14 or the solid-state immersion lens 26 to the optical storage medium 18 does not reach the grooves or pits, more accurately the recording layer, but is reflected in the vicinity of the inner side on the surface of the protective layer 183. As a result, the optical data storage system cannot perform writing and/or reading of information with respect to the high density optical storage medium 18.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which elements having the same reference numerals perform the same functions.<br>
Referring to FIG. 7, an optical data storage system according to a first embodiment of the present invention includes an optical pickup having a light transmission and reception portion 10, a reflective mirror 12, a catadioptric solid-state immersion optical system 64, and a slider 66, and an optical storage medium 68. Since the elements shown in FIG. 7 perform the same optical functions as those having the same reference numerals shown in FIG. 1, the detailed description thereof will be omitted.<br>
The optical storage medium 68 includes a substrate 681, an optically transparent protective layer 686, and a recording layer disposed between the substrate 681 and the protective layer 686, which is generally in the form of a disc. In the case of an overwritable optical storage medium 68, the recording layer is formed by coating an optically sensitive material on the surface of the substrate 681. The optical storage medium 68 is fabricated in such a manner that the light beam emitted from the catadioptric solid-state immersion optical system 64 transmits the protective layer 686 having an optical transmissive characteristic and forms a minimized beam spot on the recording layer. Differently from the existing storage medium 18 having a thin protective layer 183, the optical storage medium 68 has the protective layer 686 thicker than the wavelength of light used. An air gap exists between the protective layer 686 and the solid-state immersion optical<br>
system 64. Therefore, the surface of the solid-state immersion optical system 64 positioned toward the reflective mirror 12 has an aspherical surface forming a minimized beam spot on the recording layer of the optical storage medium 68, taking the thickness and refractive index of the protective layer 686 into consideration.<br>
Alternatively, the catadioptric solid-state immersion optical system 64 is fabricated in the shape and material similar to those of the solid-state immersion optical system 14 of FIG. 1. As described above, the shape is slightly changed considering the thickness of the substrate thicker than one wavelength of the used light.<br>
The light beam 1 proceeding from the reflective mirror 12 to the solid-state immersion lens 64 is refracted and reflected in the solid-state immersion lens 64 and forms a beam spot in the center of the surface opposing the protective layer 686 of the storage medium 68, as shown in FIG. 7. The slider 66 floats the solid-state immersion lens 64 aerodynamically from the surface of the storage medium 68 by the relative movement between the rotating storage medium 68 and the slider 66, and forms an air bearing between the opposing surfaces of the storage medium 68 and the slider 66. Here, the interval of the air gap existing between the surfaces of the solid-state immersion lens 64 and the protective layer 686 is maintained into less than wavelength possessed by the used light, that is the light beam 1 emitted from the light transmission and reception portion 10. In the optimal case, if the air gap interval is maintained into less than 1/4 wavelength, an interference phenomenon is reduced to thereby obtain an excellent signal to noise ratio.<br>
The light beam incident to the storage medium 68 passes through the optically transparent protective layer 686 and reaches the recording layer. Thus, in the case that the optical storage medium 68 is fabricated in the form of a high density optical storage medium, that is, the optical data storage system 68 has grooves or pits of 100-150nm wide and a protective layer 686 of 150-200nm thick, the depth from the surface of the storage medium 68 positioned toward the air gap to the grooves or pits becomes larger than the width of the grooves or pits. Thus, the-FIG. 7 system can write or read information with respect to the high density optical storage medium.<br>
FIG. 8 shows an optical data storage system according to a second embodiment of the present invention. The FIG. 8 system includes an objective lens 74, a refractive solid-state immersion lens 76 and a slider 78, instead of the solid-state immersion optical system 64 and the slider 66 shown in FIG. 7. FIG. 9 is a enlarged view of the optical storage medium 88 and the solid-state immersion lens 76 shown in FIG. 8.<br>
x<br>
The objective lens 74 focuses the light beam incident from the reflective mirror 22 on the refractive solid-state immersion lens 76. In this embodiment, differently from the above-described storage medium 68, the optical storage medium 88 includes a substrate 881 having an optical transmissive characteristic on one surface opposing the solid-state immersion lens 76, and a protective layer 883 on the other surface far from the solid-state immersion lens 76. Grooves or pits for recording information arc formed on the substrate 881 of the optical storage medium 88. An unevenness structure 885 formed by the grooves or pits formed on the<br>
optical transmissive substrate 881 is illustrated in the form of wedge or well concave toward the substrate 881 in FIG. 9.<br>
The solid-state immersion lens 76 forms an optimized beam spot on the recording layer of the optical storage medium 88, in the center of the surface of the solid-state immersion lens 76 opposing the storage medium 88, using the light beam incident from the objective lens 74. In this case, the objective lens 74 and the solid-state immersion lens 76 form a beam spot providing a numerical aperture of at least one on the above-described surface of the solid-state immersion lens 76. The slider 78 floats the solid-state immersion lens 76 from the surface of the rotating storage medium 88 and maintains an interval of the air gap between the surfaces of the solid-state immersion lens 76 and the substrate 881 into 1/4 or less of the wavelength of the light beam emitted from the light transmission and reception portion 20.<br>
In the case that the interval of the air gap is 1/4 or more of the wavelength of the used light, the light beam providing the numerical aperture of one or more is totally reflected from the air gap when the light beam forming the beam spot on the surface of the solid-state immersion lens 76 opposing the storage medium 88 passes through the air gap. Thus, only the light beam providing the numerical aperture of less than one is transferred to the optical storage medium 88. The spot size of the light beam reaching the storage medium 88 becomes relatively large. However, when the interval of the air gap becomes less than 1/4 of the wavelength of the used light, the light beam of the numerical aperture of one or more is transferred to the storage medium 88, and the size of the beam spot<br>
becomes small. Also, since the unevenness structure 885 in which the recording layer is formed is far from the air gap compared with the existing optical storage medium, the recording layer reflective light is protected from the interference due to the air gap reflective light. Thus, the optical data storage system shown in FIG. 8 can write or read information with respect to the optical storage medium 88 with an excellent signal to noise ratio as well. In FIG. 9, the solid arrow line denotes "recording layer reflective light" reflected from the recording layer of the storage medium 88 and the dotted arrow line denotes "air gap reflective light" reflected from the surface of the solid-state immersion lens 76, the air gap and the substrate 881.<br>
FIG. 10 shows an optical data storage system according to a third embodiment of the present invention. The system shown in FIG. 10 includes a double-sided optical storage medium 90. The optical storage medium 90 is fabricated in a manner that substrates 681 of two sheets of the optical storage media 68 shown in FIG. 7 are adjacent to each other or contact each other. Otherwise, the storage medium 90 is fabricated in a manner that protective layers 883 of two sheets of the optical storage media 88 shown in FIG. 8 are adjacent to each other or contact each other, or only a protective layer 883 remains after two sheets of the optical storage media have been incorporated into one. The FIG. 10 system includes a pair of the light transmission and reception portions 20, the reflective mirrors 22, the objective lenses 74, the solid-state immersion lenses 76 and the sliders 78, for the optical storage medium 90. Since the operation of the FIG. 10 system can be appreciated by one skilled in the art well through the above-described embodiments, the detailed description thereof will be<br>
omitted.<br>
Since fabrication of the optical data storage system for writing and/or reading information with respect to the optical storage medium 90 shown in FIG. 10 using the system shown in FIG. 7 or 8 is also apparent to those who have an ordinary skill in the art, the detailed description thereof will be omitted.<br>
In the above-described first embodiment, the thickness of the protective layer 686 may become thick infinitely in principle, but it is so sufficient that the air gap between the solid-state immersion optical system 64 and the protective layer 686 is smaller than one wavelength of the used light. However, considering the practical thickness and the numerical aperture determining the size of the light spot, the thickness of the protective layer 686 may be enough several micrometers to several hundred micrometers. As an example, the thickness of the substrate of a digital versatile disc (DVD) is 0.6mm, that is, 600//m. It is apparent to keep more practical with the above thickness.<br>
Also, although the optical axis of the solid-state immersion optical system 64 or the solid-state immersion lens 76 is not perpendicular to the surface of the optical storage medium 68 or 88 but is slanted thereto, if the distance between the portion of the solid-state immersion optical system 64 or solid-state immersion lens 76 farthest from the surface of the optical storage medium 68 or 88, and the surface of the optical storage medium 68 or 88 is within the wavelength of the used light, the light beam reflected from the inside of the air gap or the inside of the storage medium between the air gap and the recording layer does not function as noise with respect<br>
to the light beam reflected from the recording layer. In particular, if the size of the light beam focused by the solid-state immersion optical system 64 or solid-state immersion lens 76 maintains 0.1-0.2mm at the time of passing through the surface of the optical storage medium 68 or 88, an excellent recording or reproduction characteristic can be obtained with respect to the optical storage medium 68 or 88 having dust or damage on the surface thereof.<br>
FIG. 11 shows a hierarchical structure of the optical disc which embodies the optical storage medium 68 shown in FIG. 7. The optical disc shown in FIG. 11 is a high density magnetooptical disc having a recording capacity of 20GByte or more, which includes a substrate 681, and a reflective layer 682, a first dielectric layer 683, a recording layer 684, a second dielectric layer 685, a protective layer 686 and a lubricant film 687 which are put on the substrate 681 in turn. The substrate 681 is made of glass, polycarbonate, PMMA, and an acrylrate-based resin, and has an unevenness structure of a track pitch of 0.3-0.4 n m and a groove depth of 50-800A. The reflective layer 682 is made of one of aluminium (AD, nickle (Ni), copper (Cu), platinum (Pt), silver (Ag) and gold (Au), and has a thickness of 500-2000A. The first and second dielectric layers 683 and 685 are made of SiaN/i, ZnS-SiCfe, etc. The first dielectric layer 683 has a thickness of 100-400 A and the second dielectric layer 684 has a thickness of 300-800A. The recording layer 684 is made of TbFeCo, NdTbFeCo, TbFe, etc., in order to perform a magnetooptical recording, and has a thickness of 150-400A. The protective layer 686 can be made of either an optically transparent inorganic material or an organic material. In this<br><br>
embodiment, the protective layer 686 is made by spin-coating acrylrate-based resin, and has a thickness of 5-100//m. The surface of the protective layer 686 is texturing-processed in order to reduce a stiction called a static friction. The interval of a bump by the texturing process is 20-60nm. and a texturing depth (or bump height) is 5-50A. The lubricating film 687 formed on the protective layer 686 has a thickness of l-3nm and is a lubricant which does not react chemically with the protective layer 686 and made of PFPE (PerfluoroPolyether). The Fomblin Z Dol or Fomblin 2001 which is used in a hard disc is used as a lubricant. The Galden SV is used as a solvent mixed with the lubricant.<br>
Referring to FIG. 12, in the case that texturing is not processed on the surface of the optical disc, a stiction occurs. However, in the case that texturing having a depth of 5A or more is performed, the stiction is reduced.<br>
In the present invention, the solid-state immersion optical system or solid-state immersion lens has been used. However, it is apparent to those having an ordinary skill, in the art that a general focusing optical system may be used instead of the solid-state immersion optical system or solid-state immersion lens, if the air gap between the emitting surface of the optical system and the protective layer of the storage medium is smaller than one wavelength of the used light and the thickness of the protective layer is thicker than the wavelength of the used light.<br>
In the above-described embodiments, the reflective mirror 12 or 22 plays a role of transferring the light beam emitted from the light transmission and reception portion 10 or 20 to the solid-state immersion lens and transferring the light beam incident from the solid-state immersion lens to the light<br>
transmission and reception portion. Thus, various optical elements which can change an optical path like a prism can be used instead of the reflective mirror.<br>
As described above, the optical data storage system according to the present invention uses an optical storage medium the thickness of which transmissive layer put between the emitting surface of a focusing optical system such as a solid-state immersion optical system . or solid-state immersion lens and a recording layer is larger than the wavelength of light used. Thus, in the present invention, the light beam reflected from the inside of the air gap or the inside of the storage medium between the air gap and the recording layer does not function as noise with respect to the light beam reflected from the recording layer. Also, since the present invention can thicken the thickness of the protective layer or the substrate which becomes the external surface of the optical storage medium, information can be written or read accurately with respect to the optical storage medium having dust or damage.<br><br><br><br><br>
