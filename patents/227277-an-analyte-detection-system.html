FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]	This invention relates to systems for obtaining physiologic fluid samples.<br>
More particularly, a test system for obtaining and testing blood samples with<br>
minimum user effort is described.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Analyte concentration determination in physiological samples is of ever<br>
increasing importance to today's society. Such assays find use in a variety of<br>
application settings, including clinical laboratory testing, home testing, etc., where<br>
the results of such testing play a prominent role in the diagnosis and management<br>
of a variety of disease conditions. Analytes of interest include glucose for<br>
diabetes management, cholesterol for monitoring cardiovascular conditions, drugs<br>
for monitoring levels of therapeutic agents or identifying illegal/illegal levels of<br>
drugs, and the like. In response to this growing importance of analyte<br>
concentration determination, a variety of analyte concentration determination<br>
protocols and devices for both clinical and home testing have been developed.<br>
[0003]	In determining the concentration of an analyte in a physiological sample, a<br>
physiological sample must first be obtained. Obtaining and testing the sample<br>
often involves cumbersome and complicated procedures. Unfortunately,<br>
successful manipulation and handling of test elements, lancing members, meters<br>
and the like is to a great extent dependent on the visual acuity and manual<br>
dexterity of the user, which in the case of people with diabetes is subject to<br><br>
deterioration over the course of the disease state. In extreme cases people that<br>
have significant loss of sight and sensation, testing procedures can become<br>
significantly difficult and requires additional assistance from ancillary devices or<br>
personnel.<br>
[0004]	A typical procedure involved with making a glucose measurement<br>
involves the following actions or steps (but not necessarily in the order given):<br>
1)	removing supplies from a carrying case,<br>
2)	removing a lancing device loading cap or door,<br>
3)	removing and disposing of an old lancet form the lancing<br>
device.<br>
4)	inserting the lancet in the lancing device,<br>
5)	twisting off a protective cap from the lancet,<br>
6)	replacing the lancing device cap.<br>
7)	cocking the lancing device,<br>
8)	opening a test strip vial/ container,<br>
9)	removing a strip from the container and inserting or interfacing<br>
it with a meter,<br><br>
10)	holding a lancing device to the skin,<br>
11)	firing the lancing device,<br>
12)	lifting the lancing device and setting aside,<br>
13)	extracting a sample,<br>
14)	applying sample to the test strip and getting results,<br>
15)	disposing of the test strip,<br>
16)	cleaning the test site, and<br>
17)	returning supplies to the carrying case.<br>
Sometimes fewer steps are involved. One manner of reducing the number or<br>
actions is by integrated devices set to combine multiple functions.<br>
[0005]	In this regard, certain test strip dispensers are configured to both store and<br>
advance successive test strips upon actuation. Examples of such devices are<br>
presented in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,510,266; 5,575,403, 5,797,693 and possibly in<br>
PCT Publication WO 01/63272. In addition some dispensers also include meter<br>
functionality. Examples of such of systems that integrate test strip meter and<br>
dispenser combination functions are disclosed in U.S. Patent No, 5,736,103,<br><br>
5,757,666 and PCT Publication WO 99/44508. Furthermore, the device described<br>
in WO 01/23885 includes all of the above features, plus a receptacle to receive<br>
spent test strip elements that are cut off of a continuous roll of the same.<br>
[0006]	Another class of devices designed to decrease the number of steps<br>
required in test strip use includes automatic or semi-automatic lancing devices.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,228,100 discloses a structure configured for sequential firing of<br>
a number of lancets, one at a time, in order to eliminate the requirement that a<br>
user remove and replace each lancet individually before and after use.<br>
[0007]	The device disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,971,941 attempts to combine the<br>
functionality of each of the preceding classes of test strip devices. In effort to<br>
provide an "integrated" system for sampling blood and analysis thereof, it<br>
includes a magazine of test strips, test strip advancement and dispensing features,<br>
a meter with a display and an automated lancing mechanism all housed with a<br>
single box. Wrhile presenting some measure of advance in user convenience, the<br>
test strip and lancing features are removed from each other causing the user to<br>
take two steps in lancing and transferring sample to a test strip. Furthermore, the<br>
device includes no provisions for used test strips.<br>
[0008]	While certain combination test strip and lancing systems that do not <br>
require that a subject to move the device relative to the sample site in use (e.g.,<br>
the systems described in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,352,514; 6,332,871; 6,183,489;<br>
6,099,484; 6,056,701 and 5,820,570), some of these systems are quite complex<br>
and, consequently, either difficult to operate or costly to produce. In addition,<br>
some involve changing-out spent test and/or lancet members one-at-a-time. This<br><br>
is true with respect to the systems described in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,027,459;<br>
6,063.039; 6,071,251 and 6,283,926 as well as for certain embodiments disclosed<br>
in PCT Publication WO 01/64105.<br>
[0009]	However, another embodiment presented in that reference provides for<br>
multiple lancet/sensor pairs that only need to be changed out after the disks<br>
including each are spent. An exemplary number of a dozen such radially-oriented<br>
pairs is provided. PCT Application entitled "Analyte Measurement," claiming a<br>
priority of 19 December 2000 from GB 0030929.4 also discloses a meter<br>
including a multiple sensor/tester element. Fluid extracted from a subject by a<br>
microneedle at a common entrance port is selectively switched between a number<br>
of microchannels by means of electro-osmotic pumps and hydrophobic gates.<br>
The present invention is distinguished from each of these inventions in terms of<br>
its modular use of combination test strip and sensor elements, in which unexposed<br>
items may be sealed-off from contamination, and possibly provided in greater<br>
number, as well as in the simplicity of the present invention which preferably<br>
involves mechanical movement for sample acquisition and handling.<br>
[0010]	Of course, such advantages may be present in systems according to the<br>
invention in various degrees. It is intended that, in one way or another, the<br>
invention is of assistance in reducing barriers to patient self-monitoring and<br>
therefore result in improved outcomes in the management of disease, such as<br>
diabetes.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0011]	A preferred variation of the invention truly minimizes the steps required<br>
for analyte test strip use as defined above. As practiced with each of the optional<br>
features, the present invention merely involves four such user steps. These<br>
include: providing a system according to the present invention, placing it against a<br>
test site, pushing the system body portions together and reading a test result. The<br>
system is then reproved and put away. It may include a cap to be removed<br>
initially and replaced finally.<br>
[0012]	In a preferred variation of the invention, such a cap includes a magazine<br>
that automatically receives spent or used test strips. In another variation of the<br>
invention (one in which test strips are merely ejected) a user disposal step may be<br>
added.<br>
[0013]	The system of the present invention utilizes disposable test strip elements<br>
that include an integral lancet. Examples of such strips include those described in<br>
U.S. Patent Application S/Nos. 09/919,981, 09/923,093 and Attorney Docket No.<br>
LIFE-035. The needle may be configured to collect blood, interstitial fluid, other<br>
body fluids, or any combination thereof. Regardless of the type of strip chosen<br>
and sample to be collected, the members are stored in a magazine, from which<br>
they are fired to produce a wound to receive sample therefrom.<br>
[0014]	The action provided by the meter/dispenser of the present invention is<br>
preferably implemented by a series of links, levers and spring elements such that<br>
advancement of an upper body portion relative to a lower body portion resting<br>
against a test site causes a test strip to be taken from the magazine advanced to<br><br>
form a stick and collect sample. Following such action, the meter may be<br>
removed, test results are displayed and such action as desired to dispose of the<br>
used test strip occurs.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0015]	Each of the figures diagrammatically illustrates aspects of the invention.<br>
To facilitate understanding, the same reference numerals have been used (where<br>
practical) to designate similar elements that are common to the figures. Some<br>
such numbering has, however, been omitted for the sake of drawing clarity.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0019]	In describing the invention in greater detail than provided in the Summary<br>
above, details of an embodiment of the invention together with aspects of system<br>
use. Two alternate variations of the invention are described in this manner,<br>
though other variations are possible. Finally, examples of a preferred test strip for<br>
use in the device are disclosed.<br><br>
[0020]	Before the present invention is described in such detail, however, it is to<br>
be understood that this invention is not limited to particular variations set forth<br>
and may, of course, vary. Various changes may be made to the invention<br>
described and equivalents may be substituted, without departing from the true<br>
spirit and scope of the invention. In addition, many modifications may be made<br>
to adapt a particular situation, material, composition of matter, process, process<br>
act(s) or step(s), to the objective(s), spirit or scope of the present invention. All<br>
such modifications are intended to be within the scope of the claims made herein.<br>
[0021]	Methods recited herein may be carried out in any order of the recited<br>
events which is logically possible, as well as the recited order of events.<br>
Furthermore, where a range of values is provided, it is understood that every<br>
intervening value, between the upper and lower limit of that range and any other<br>
stated or intervening value in that stated range is encompassed within the<br>
invention. Also, it is contemplated that any optional feature of the inventive<br>
variations described may be set forth and claimed independently, or in<br>
combination with any one or more of the features described herein.<br>
[0022]	All existing subject matter mentioned herein (e.g., publications, patents,<br>
patent applications and hardware) is incorporated by reference herein in its <br>
entirety except insofar as the subject matter may conflict with that of the present<br>
invention (in which case what is present herein shall prevail). The referenced<br>
items are provided solely for their disclosure prior to the filing date of the present<br>
application. Nothing herein is to be construed as an admission that the present<br>
invention is not entitled to antedate such material by virtue of prior invention.<br><br>
[0023]	Reference to a singular item, includes the possibility that there are plural<br>
of the same items present. More specifically, as used herein and in the appended<br>
claims, the singular forms "a," "and," "said" and "the" include plural referents<br>
unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. It is further noted that the claims<br>
may be drafted to exclude any optional element. As such, this statement is<br>
intended to serve as antecedent basis for use of such exclusive terminology as<br>
"solely," "only" and the like in connection with the recitation of claim elements,<br>
or use of a "negative" limitation. Last, it is to be appreciated that unless defined<br>
otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as<br>
commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention<br>
belongs.<br>
Device and System Use<br>
[0024]	Turning now to FIGS 1A and 1B an exemplary system 2 according to the<br>
present invention is disclosed. The device is a meter that includes actuation<br>
features for firing test strips 4. A screen 6 is provided to display meter results<br>
and/or direct user action in connect with system 2 use. Other externally visible<br>
features include optional adjustment knob 8, cap 10 and interlock button 12.<br>
[0025]	Whether all or none of these optional features are included, system 2<br>
comprises an upper body portion 14 and a lower body portion 16. As shown in<br>
FIG 2A, the lower body portion is exposed upon removal of cap 10.<br>
[0026]	In operation, lower body portion 16 is slidingly received by upper body<br>
portion 14. The relative motion between these two members actuates the various<br>
elements within system 2. As described further below, the mechanism enables<br><br>
combination of two steps involved in lancing: namely the cocking of the launcher<br>
mechanism and the release of the launcher. Specifically, a single motion first<br>
cocks the mechanism and later releases the cocked mechanism. This design<br>
approach is similar to that of a center punch used in creating an indentation on a<br>
surface. In combination with a test strip integrating a biosensor and lancet,<br>
pressing system 2 against the surface of the skin leads to a single step in<br>
performing a procedure that normally involves in excess of 10 to 15 steps.<br>
[0027]	As shown in FIGS 1A and 1B, system 2 is in an "off mode. In this mode,<br>
knob 8 is preferably actuated by turning clockwise or counterclockwise to set the<br>
depth, or any other variable that may be necessary to adapt to a specific user (e.g.,<br>
force on a pressure-ring), to which a lance portion 18 of test strip 4 will fire<br>
relative to a face 20 of the system. Face 20 may serve as such a "pressure ring" in<br>
that when it is applied to the skin surface, it depresses tissue around a periphery of<br>
the intended wound site. The force on pressure ring may be dictated by the<br>
compression force to slide the lower portion into the upper portion; upon<br>
application of this force, the test strip is typically also launched into the skin. The<br>
pressure formed at the site to be lanced, resulting at least in part from stretching<br>
the skin in this area, is useful for extracting a sample in that it helps "pump"<br>
material from the wound produced.<br>
[0028]	Wound/penetration depth is preferably set to between about 0.02 mm and<br>
2.0 mm, or more preferably set between 0.5 mm and 1.5 mm, by virtue of a<br>
screw-type interface 22 which advances or retracts an extension 24 carrying a stop<br><br>
portion 26. Such adjustment action usually accomplished at this stage is indicated<br>
by the use of bold in connection with the elements at issue.<br>
[0029]	FIGS 2A and 2B show cap 10 being removed from system 2. It is<br>
slidingly received by lower body portion 16. Detent features may be provided in<br>
order to prevent inadvertent separation of the elements.<br>
[0030]	Removal of cap 10 preferably turns the system "on" as indicated in FIG<br>
2A. Where no cap is provided, another preliminary action may be required to<br>
activate the system (such as depressing a button) or system 2 could be activated<br>
by subsequent activity that is described.<br>
[0031]	In any event, as shown in the other figures, various user directions or<br>
essages may be displayed by the meter. In addition to displaying test results<br>
and directions, display 6 may present information regarding the number of test<br>
strips left, time to expiration, etc.<br>
[0032]	FIG 3B illustrates actuation of button 12 for a different purpose (though, it<br>
could be used to turn the system on as well). When a user depresses button 12 as<br>
shown, an interlocking interface 28 formed by an extension 30 of button 12 and<br>
another extension 32 of lower body portion 16 is released. A spring member 34<br>
may be provided to bias the button outwardly.<br>
[0033]	Any form of spring may be used in this regard. The same is true for other<br>
springs employed in the invention. By varying the internal configuration of<br>
system 2 flat springs, leaf springs, coil springs, torsion springs or extension<br>
springs may be used. What is more, metal or polymer spring members may be<br>
interchangeably used.<br><br>
[0034]	Regardless of such constructional details, with face 20 exposed and<br>
interlock or safety mechanism 28 set free (most preferably by depressing button<br>
12) the face is set against a target site. Such a target site might be a patient's or<br>
user's finger, forearm, palm, or elsewhere.<br>
[0035]	With system 2 so positioned an "apply" message may appear on screen 6<br>
as shown in FIG 4A. Whether prompted in this manner or not, FIG 4B shows the<br>
next action taken by a user. Here, upper body portion 14 is pushed toward the<br>
target site. This causes system 2 to collapse, with lower body portion 16 slidingly<br>
received within upper body portion 14.<br>
[0036]	Such user activity results in several actions within device 2. For one,<br>
interlock portions 28 and 32 slide past each other (instead of interfering with each<br>
other's movement). In addition, a lancing mechanism 36 within system 2 is<br>
cocked. This is accomplished by stressing launch spring 38. While this may be<br>
accomplished otherwise, in the variation of the invention shown here, a lever arm<br>
40 driven by a cocking extension 42 of lower body portion 16 provides the input.<br>
A lance interface member 44 is held in a cocked position by a latch 46 and<br>
cooperative catch 48 at one end of the interface member.<br>
[0037]	At the other end of interface member 44, test strip interface features 50 are<br>
provided. These pick up or interface with a test strip 4. As shown, interface<br>
features advance a test strip slightly relative to other test strips contained within a<br>
magazine 52.<br>
[0038]	The magazine may be configured in any convenient manner to allow<br>
loading of a large number of test strips therein (e.g., between about 10 and 100,<br><br>
more preferably between 15 and 25) and release therefrom. Providing numerous<br>
test strips as possible in view of the magazine format employed by the present<br>
invention allows for greatly increased user convenience.<br>
[0039]	Magazine 52 is preferably spring-loaded in order to function properly<br>
regardless of orientation. The magazine preferably has a door 136, which remains<br>
closed except during brief periods of time when the test strip is removed, serves<br>
as a moisture barrier. (A similar door or barrier may be provided for waste<br>
magazine 22). Also, a drying agent (e.g., a desiccate) may be contained within<br>
the magazine to protect the test strips' reagent from moisture. To further preserve<br>
the integrity of unused test strips, the mechanism driving the test strip and<br>
operating the door is preferably configured so it will not leave a test strip partially<br>
advanced or the magazine open if the user were not to complete the total relative<br>
motion of sliding lower portion 16 into upper portion 14.<br>
[0040]	The magazine, may take the form of a removable cartridge or cassette as<br>
shown in FIG. 10A described further below. Especially under such<br>
circumstances, it may contain a barcode or some other means (such as a chip) for<br>
transferring information to the meter upon loading the same with test strips or a<br>
strip cartridge. In which case, the meter would automatically read this<br>
information when the magazine/cartridge is loaded into the system, via an<br>
optional detection system 138 (shown in FIG. 10B). Any conventional reader or<br>
placement as appropriate to the media by which the information is expressed may<br>
be employed. Regardless of such constructional details, examples of information<br>
that may be useful include: a calibration factor or code, number of strips<br><br>
remaining/used in magazine, number of days since magazine was installed and/or<br>
days until strip expiration (such as a hard date or a date that is a function of when<br>
the magazine was loaded into the system).<br>
[0041 ]	Further optional feature(s) that may be included in meter 2 include<br>
diagnosis or calibration system(s). For example, system 2 may include features to<br>
determine if it is working properly in reference to one or more control species,<br>
such as a control solution comprising glucose of a known concentration.<br>
[0042]	The relative motion between body portions 14 and 16 also results in<br>
cocking or loading a return spring 54. Its use will be described further below.<br>
[0043]	FIGS 5A and 5B, show activity in connection with lance/test strip firing<br>
preceding such action. In one variation, motion of the lower body portion 16<br>
cams latch 46 to release spring loaded interface member 44 to travel, push<br>
magazine door 136 open, and pick-up a strip to advance it out of the magazine.<br>
Alternately, an electronic solenoid (not shown) activated by electronics included<br>
in system 2 can be utilized to release latch 46, whereupon interface member 44,<br>
together with test strip 4 advances as indicated. As it advances toward the skin,<br>
interface member 44 preferably urges the test element through guides 78.<br>
[0044]	In use, since only the needle end of a test element/strip comes in contact<br>
with a user, the opposite end of the device adjacent interface member 44 does not<br>
into contact with body fluids. Accordingly, this element is not able to<br>
contaminate unused test strips upon retraction past the same. Further, magazine<br>
door 136 is opened only for a very short time period, thereby minimizing<br>
opportunity for contamination. In addition (as further described below), used test<br><br>
strips are ejected from the system or stored in a (sealed) magazine in the cap and<br>
are never brought near the magazine. All of these factors may contribute to<br>
maintaining unused test strip quality.<br>
[0045]	A tip 56 of the lance portion of the test strip is shown protruding slightly<br>
from the face 20 of system 2. As shown in FIG 5A, the meter screen preferably<br>
directs a user to hold the device in place. This allows time for sample collection<br>
from the wound produced, such as by a pressure-ring to force fluid from the<br>
wound and capillary action along the lance member 18. Still, it is to be noted that<br>
other driving forces, such as vacuum, may be employed to facilitate sample<br>
acquisition.<br>
[0046]	Following a sufficient time interval, (e.g., usually between about 0.1 and<br>
15 seconds, preferably less than 3 seconds), as shown in FIG 6A, the system<br>
preferably directs the user to remove system 2 from the test site. By such action,<br>
as shown in FIG 6B, lower body portion returns to its pre-compressed state.<br>
Preferably return spring 54 urges the body portions away from each other as<br>
shown. As the body portions separate, an interface member return catch 58<br>
withdraws interface member 44. Catch 58 is preferably provided at an end of a<br>
return member 60 that is actuated by lever 40, which is, in turn, associated with<br>
lower body portion 16. Pivoting interface portions 62 are preferred, though the<br>
parts may be integrally molded with living hinge sections or otherwise produced.<br>
[0047]	In addition to showing the movement of the body portions relative to each<br>
other in an intermediate state, FIG 6B shows a test strip disposal mechanism 64 as<br>
it swings into position for action. The mechanism may comprise a pusher arm 66<br><br>
with a stop or interface portion 68, a lever arm 70 and an intermediate link 72.<br>
These members may also be spring-loaded. Furthermore, there construction may-<br>
vary in like manner to the other components noted directly above.<br>
[0048]	In order for the members of the disposal mechanism to reach the location<br>
shown in FIG 6B, as it progresses to that shown in FIG 7B (or 7D), certain<br>
antecedent actions may have occurred. These are illustrated in connection with<br>
FIGS 1B, 2B and 4B.<br>
[0049]	In FIG 1A, disposal mechanism 64 is shown at a rest position. A<br>
protrusion 74 at the end of lever arm 70 is interfaced with a complementary<br>
pusher portion 76 of cap 10 (see FIG 1B). Upon removal of the cap, the disposal<br>
mechanism moves to the position shown in FIG 2B. From here, it is able to swing<br>
out of the way of lance firing as shown in FIG 4B. Ultimately, as illustrated in<br>
FIG 6B, it moves into position as seen in FIG 7B.<br>
[0050]	In FIG 7B, interface portion 68 is shown interfacing with a used strip 4'<br>
The strip is at least partially confined by optional opposing guide members 78. In<br>
this location an adjacent meter element 80 may be used to read the strip -<br>
especially where colorametric sensors are employed. Alternately, where<br>
electrochemical test strips are used, the guides 78 may serve the dual purpose of<br>
directing the test strip and also serving as electrical contacts to interface<br>
electrochemical strips to the meter, when this type of strip is used.<br>
[0051]	The result obtained (or a result derived from the data obtained) is<br>
displayed on screen 6 as shown in FIG 7A.<br><br>
[0052]	In the variation of the invention in FIGS 7C and 7D, meter functionality<br>
may be identical to that in FIGS 7A and 7B. However, in the variation shown in<br>
FIGS 7C and 7D, the disposal mechanism 64' is configured somewhat differently.<br>
The primary distinction is observed in connection with extension 82 off of lever<br>
arm 70. Instead of being configured to interface with a cap, lever the extension<br>
make lever 70' suitable for manual operation. It is preferably actuated as<br>
indicated by the double-headed arrow along slot 84 shown in FIG 7C to eject<br>
spent test strips from system 2. Before actuating the lever extension, it is<br>
preferred that a user direct the device toward a suitably waste receptacle.<br>
[0053]	Whether or not manual test strip disposal features are included in system<br>
2, it may be preferred to include waste magazine 86 in cap 10. Such a magazine<br>
is used as shown in FIGS 8A - 9B. At any time after system 2 is removed from<br>
the test site (for instance, in response to meter screen directions provided in FIG<br>
6A), cap 10 may be replaced. In doing so tab or protrusion 74 of lever arm 70 is<br>
captured by cap interface 76. This advances pusher arm 66, causing interface<br>
section 68 to drive spent test strip 4' into waste magazine 86. The addition of<br>
spent strips to its cache of spent strips held in place by biasing spring 88<br>
eventually fills the magazine. FIG 9A and 9B show cap 10 in place with system 2<br>
restored to its configuration in FIGS 1A and 1B. At this point, spent strip 4' is<br>
fully deposited within magazine 86. When the magazine is full, cap 10 may be<br>
thrown away en Toto. Such activity is shown in connection with FIGS. 10A and<br>
10B.<br><br>
[0054]	Alternately, the magazine itself may be disengaged from the cap and be<br>
thrown away alone. Either way, used test strips thus-packaged for disposal<br>
minimize any disposal issues that are presented.<br>
[0055]	Still, at least in connection with the system approach taught in FIGS 7C<br>
and 7D, it may be preferred no cap 10 is provided, thereby somewhat simplifying<br>
operation of the system. Still, it is possible to provide a system that includes a<br>
waste magazine and the ability for the user to individually dispose of test strips, as<br>
desired. Regardless, where manual test strip disposal features are provided as<br>
shown in FIGS 7C and 7D, release of button 12 to reactivate interlock 28 prior to<br>
actuating lever arm extension 82 is advised in order to prevent inadvertent<br>
movement of the body portions with respect to each other.<br>
[0056]	Furthermore, one or both of the magazines may be manually inserted<br>
and/or removed in/from their respective housing portions. In either case, a detent<br>
mechanism or finger-actuated latch (not shown) may be provided to ensure<br>
retention. Removal of an empty cartridge 52 from the upper body portion is<br>
shown in FIG. 10B. Upon opening a door 140, an empty unit may be discarded in<br>
favor of a full one or simply reloaded and replaced in the system. Utilizing a new<br>
cartridge marked with identification data as discussed above is, however,<br>
preferred.<br>
[0057]	As shown in FIG. 10, action associated with refill, replacement or disposal<br>
of test strips or ancillary equipment may be indicated on readout 6 when<br>
appropriate. Alternately, or additionally, magazines 22 and/or 52 may be<br>
produced with transparent material or an indicator may be provided to inform a<br><br>
user of its status. A open or transparent window in cover 10 or the body of the<br>
meter may be employed to allow the user to observe the quantity of unused strips<br>
in the magazine(s)/cassette(s).<br>
Test Strips<br>
[0058]	As noted above, many types of test strips which integrally include a<br>
biosensor and a forward-pointing lance member may be used in the present<br>
invention. However, of the examples given, those described in Attorney Docket<br>
No. LIFE-035, entitled Physiological Sample Collection Devices and Methods of<br>
Using the Same, may be most preferred. Details regarding the production and use<br>
of such devices are presented therein. Regardless a brief description is provided<br>
below.<br>
[0059]	FIGS 11A and 11B illustrate such an exemplary test strip or biosensor<br>
device 90 fully described in the above-referenced case. Device 90 includes an<br>
electrochemical test strip configuration and a microneedle 92 integrated therewith.<br>
The biosensor is defined by an electrochemical cell generally having two spaced-<br>
apart and opposing electrodes 94 and 96, respectively referred to herein as bottom<br>
electrode 94 and top electrode 96, though in use they may oriented in any<br>
direction. At least the surfaces of electrodes 94 and 96 facing each other are<br>
comprised of a conductive layer 98 and 100, respectively, such as a metal,<br>
deposited on an inert substrate 102 and 104, respectively. The spacing between<br>
the two electrodes is a result of the presence of a spacer layer 106 positioned or<br>
sandwiched between electrodes 94 and 96. Spacer layer 106 preferably has<br>
double-sided adhesive to hold the electrodes. The spacer layer is preferably<br><br>
configured or cut so as to provide a reaction zone or area 108. A redox reagent<br>
system or composition 110 is present within reaction zone 108, where the reagent<br>
system is selected to interact with targeted components in the fluid sample,<br>
typically whole blood, during an assay of the sample. Redox reagent system 110<br>
is usually deposited on the conductive layer 100 of top electrode 96 wherein,<br>
when in a completely assembled form (as shown in Fig. 10B), redox reagent<br>
system 110 resides within reaction zone 108. With such a configuration, bottom<br>
electrode 94 serves as a counter/reference electrode and top electrode 96 serves as<br>
the working electrode of the electrochemical cell. However, in other<br>
embodiments, depending on the voltage sequence applied to the cell, the role of<br>
the electrodes can be reversed such that the bottom electrode serves as a working<br>
electrode and top electrode serves as a counter/reference electrode.<br>
[0060]	Microneedle 92 is preferably integrally formed with and extends from<br>
bottom electrode 94. The microneedle is shown with a space-defining<br>
configuration in the form of a concave recess 112 within its top surface. The<br>
recess creates a corresponding space within skin tissue upon penetration of<br>
microneedle 92 into the skin. This space acts as a sample fluid collection<br>
reservoir wherein fluid released upon penetration is pooled within the space prior<br>
to transfer into the electrochemical cell. An opening 114 to further expose the<br>
pooling area defined by recess 112 to the outside environment may also be<br>
included, thereby increasing the volume and flow rate of body fluid into the<br>
pooling area.<br><br>
[0061]	Biosensor device 90 further includes a sample fluid transfer or extraction<br>
pathway or channel 116 which extends from recess 112 to within the biosensor.<br>
At least a portion of a proximal end of the pathway resides within the biosensor<br>
portion of device 90, specifically within reaction zone 108, and a portion of a<br>
distal end of pathway 114 resides within microneedle 92. Pathway 116 is<br>
dimensioned so as to exert a capillary force on fluid within the pooling area<br>
defined by recess 112, and draws or wicks physiological sample to within the<br>
reaction zone. Extending laterally from proximal portion 114 of the pathway to<br>
within a portion or the entirety of the reaction zone are sub-channels 118. The<br>
sub-channels facilitate the filling of reaction zone 108 with the sampled fluid.<br>
[0062]	FIGS 12A and 12B illustrate another suitable embodiment of a<br>
biosensor/skin-piercing device 90' which is also disclosed in Attorney Docket No.<br>
LIFE 035, entitled Physiological Sample Collection Devices and Methods of<br>
Using the Same. Device 90' has a photometric/colorimetric biosensor<br>
configuration and a microneedle 92' integrated therewith. The colorimetric or<br>
photometric biosensor is generally made up of at least the following components:<br>
a support element or substrate 120 made of either an inert material, including<br>
suitable plastics, or a metal material, a matrix or matrix area 122 for receiving a<br>
sample, a reagent composition 124 within the matrix area, the reagent<br>
composition typically including one or more members of an analyte oxidation<br>
signal producing system, an air venting port (not shown) and a top layer 126<br>
which covers at least matrix 122. In some embodiments, top layer 126 may be a<br>
membrane containing a reagent composition impregnated therein while the matrix<br><br>
122 may or may not contain reagent composition. Further, test strip 90' may<br>
include a double-sided adhesive layer 128 situated between substrate 120 and<br>
membrane 126 to hold them together. Double-sided adhesive layer 130 has a cut-<br>
out portion 132 which corresponds to the area of matrix 122 and defines an area<br>
for deposition of the sampled physiological fluid and for the various members of<br>
the signal producing system.<br>
[0063]	Microneedle 92 is preferably formed with and extends from substrate 120<br>
and has a space-defining configuration in the form of an opening 114 which<br>
extends transverse to a dimension, e.g., width or thickness, of microneedle 92'.<br>
As with recess 112 of microneedle 90 above, opening 114 forms an open space<br>
within the tissue upon penetration of the microneedle into the skin. Such open<br>
space acts as a sample fluid collection reservoir wherein fluid released upon<br>
penetration is pooled within the space prior to transfer into the photometric/<br>
colorimetric cell. Note, however, that the needle variation shown in FIGS 11A<br>
and 11B may instead rely solely on a recess and omit a through-hole.<br>
[0064]	Biosensor device 90' hosts a sample fluid transfer or extraction pathway<br>
116 having a distal end which extends within a portion of microneedle 92' and<br>
terminates at a distal opening 114. At least a portion of the proximal end of ^<br>
pathway 116 resides within the biosensor portion of device, specifically within<br>
matrix area 122. Pathway 116 is dimensioned so as to exert a capillary force on<br>
fluid within the pooling area defined by opening 114, and draws or wicks<br>
physiological sample to within matrix area 122. Extending laterally from<br>
proximal portion of pathway 116 to within a portion or the entirety of matrix area<br><br>
122 are sub-channels 134, which facilitate the filling of matrix or matrix area 122<br>
with the sampled fluid.<br>
