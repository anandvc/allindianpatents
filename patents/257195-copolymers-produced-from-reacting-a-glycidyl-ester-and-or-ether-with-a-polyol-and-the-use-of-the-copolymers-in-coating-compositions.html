providing high solids coating compositions having low VOC's to comply with environmental controls.  In an effort to develop such coatings, reactive diluents having lower molecular weights and Sow viscosity have been used to repiace some of the high molecular weight, high viscosity polymers typically used in coatings. For instance, glycidyl esters have been reacted with polyols to form adducts having a very narrow molecular weight distribution, i.e., 
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

least 50% by weight of the copoiymer comprises a minimum of 3n+X repeating units,<br>
wherein n is a monomer unit and X is a monomer unit and/or other reactant<br>
[0005]	Also contemplated by the present invention is a coating<br>
corriposiliorj eiVtpioyiity ihw inveniive copolymer, Sucft a coating composition comprises the inventive'copolymer containing functional groups and a curing agent having functional groups reactive with the functional groups of the copolymer,<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0006]	The present invention is directed to a copoiymer for use in coating<br>
compositions. The copolymer of the present invention is the reaction product of a giycidyi ester and/or ether with a polyoi.<br>
â€¢[0007]	in one embodiment, a giycidyi ester, such as the giycidyi ester of a C5<br>
- C12 aliphatic acid, is used,  in another embodiment a giycidyi ether, such as the<br>
giycidyi ether of a C5 - CI 2 aliphatic alcohol, is used,  illustrative of a giycidyi ester is<br>
a monglycidyi ester of.a branched cariboxylic acid such aspivalic acid and versatic<br>
add. One such material is commercially available as CARDURA E10.<br>
[0008]	The poiyol reacted with the giycidyi ester and/or ether is one that has<br>
a functionality ranging from 2 to 18.  in one embodiment, the polyoi functionality is from 2 to 5. Polyois of varying molecular weights may be used.  In another embodiment, the polyoi has a number average molecular weight (Win) of less than 300. Some examples of such polyois include neopentyl glycol, 2-ethyl-1, 3 hexane diol, cyciohexane dimethanoi, trimethyoipropane, tris(hydroxyethyl)isocyanurate, and pentaerythritoi.<br>
[0009J	In certain embodiments, the molar ratio of giycidyi ester and/or<br>
ethenpolyol is at least 3:1. For instance, ratios of 3:1, 4:1, and 5:1 are typical as well as any variation thereof, i.e., 2.8:0.18.<br>
[00010]	The reaction can be carried out in the presence of a catalyst. One<br>
such catalyst is stannous octoate.  If the catalyst is used, it is present in an amount sufficient to accelerate the reaction of the giycidyi ester with the polyoi. The catalyst is typically used in an amount ranging from 0.01% to 1.0% based on the total weight of the reactants.<br>
[00011]	The copolymers produced by way of the reaction recited above have a<br>
molecular weight distribution, defined as the ratio of the weight average molecular weight, Mw, to the number average molecular weight, Mn. that is greater than 1.10. The molecular weight distribution is dependent on the properties and functionality of<br>
the polyol used in the reaction. The following Table 1 illustrates the relationship between the molar ratios of poiyo! to glycidyl ester and the resultant molecular weight distribution (IViw/Mn) of the copolymer.<br>
TABLE 1<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
[00012]	Table 1 above details a particular trend of the foregoing reaction that<br>
the greater the functionality of the polyol and/or the greater the molar ratio of gycidyl ester to polyol, the higher the molecular weight distribution. The polyols shown in Table 1 are specific polyols that may be used in the practice of the invention and are cited for illustrative purposes only.  Other poiyols are satisfying the features set forth above are also contemplated.<br>
[00013]	in one embodiment of the present invention, the copolymer has a Mn<br>
of at feast 500g/rnoi.  in other embodiments, the copolymer may also have a hydroxy!<br><br><br>
value of 50 to 300 such thai it can cross-fink with a curing agent when used in a coating formulation, in soma embodiments, a molar ratio of gycidyl ester and/or ethenpolyol is greater than or equal to 3:1 and the poiyoi has a functionality of at least 2. In this embouimÂ«itt, ihÂ« resuiiani copolymer comprises 50% by weight of the copolymer having a minimum of 3n+X repeating units, wherein n is a monomer unit and X is a monomer unit, the same or different from n, and/or other reactant. "Other reactant" Includes such things as adducts and/or tow molecular weight residues formed during the reaction.  Determining if the copolymer has a minimum of3n+X repeating units can be accomplished by analyzing its GPC data,   for example, consistent with Example 1 below, a copolymer can be formed from the reaction of 3 moles of CARDURA E with 1 mole of neopentyt glycol.  In order to achieve greater . than 50% of the copolymer having a minimum of"3n+X repeating units, at least 50% of the reaction product must have a molecular weight greater than 824g/mole which correlates to 3 moles of CARDUA E at a Mw of 240g/m to 1 mole of neopentyi glycol. at a Mw of 104g/m.  As shown by GPC data, 9 peaks are present where at least 4 of the peaks have a peak molecular weight greater than 824g/moie. These peaks comprise 60.93% of the total makeup of the copolymer. As such, it is shown that Example 1 satisfies having greater than 50% of the copolymer having a minimum of 3n+X repeating units as described above.<br>
[Q0014J	In yet another embodiment, the copolymer has less than 50%<br>
polymeric units having the same molecular weight. That is, there is no single peak in<br>
the GPC result that has an area percentage greater than 50% of the total peaks.<br>
Again, this can also be determined by analysing the GPC data of the copolymer.<br>
Looking to the GPC results of Example 1, for illustrative purposes, of the 9 peaks, the<br>
greatest area percentage peak is at a molecular weight of -804 g/mois. This peak has<br>
an area percentage of 27,73%, which is substantially less than 50%.<br>
