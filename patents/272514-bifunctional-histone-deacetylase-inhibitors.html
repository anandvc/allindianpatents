[0001]       The present invention claims priority under 35 U.S.C. § 119(e) to U.S. provisional<br>
patent application, USSN 60/773,510, filed February 14,2006, which is incorporated herein<br>
by reference.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0002]       The identification of small organic molecules that affect specific biological<br>
functions is an endeavor that impacts both biology and medicine. Such molecules are useful<br>
as therapeutic agents and as probes of biological function. In but one example from the<br>
emerging field of chemical genetics, in which small molecules can be used to alter the<br>
function of biological molecules to which they bind, these molecules have been useful at<br>
elucidating signal transduction pathways by acting as chemical protein knockouts, thereby<br>
causing a loss of protein function. (Schreiber et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1990,112, 5583;<br>
Mitchison, Chem. and Biol., 1994,1,3) Additionally, due to the interaction of these small<br>
molecules with particular biological targets and their ability to affect specific biological<br>
function (e.g. gene transcription), they may also serve as candidates for the development of<br>
new therapeutics. One important class of small molecules, natural products, which are small<br>
molecules obtained from nature, clearly have played an important role in the development of<br>
biology and medicine, serving as pharmaceutical leads, drugs (Newman et al., Nat. Prod.<br>
Rep. 2000,17, 215-234), and powerful reagents for studying cell biology (Schreiber, S.L.<br>
Chem. and Eng. News 1992 (October 26), 22-32).<br>
[0003]       One biological target of recent interest is histone deacetylase (see, for example, a<br>
discussion of the use of inhibitors of histone deacetylases for the treatment of cancer: Marks<br>
et al. Nature Reviews Cancer 2001, 1, 194; Johnstone et al. Nature Reviews Drug Discovery<br>
2002,1,287). Post-translational modification of proteins through acetylation and<br>
deacetylation of lysine residues plays a critical role in regulating their cellular functions.<br>
HDACs are zinc hydrolases that modulate gene expression through deacetylation of the N-<br>
acetyl-lysine residues of histone proteins and other transcriptional regulators (Hassig et al.<br>
Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol 1997, 1, 300-308). HDACs participate in cellular pathways that<br>
control cell shape and differentiation, and an HDAC inhibitor has been shown effective in<br>
treating an otherwise recalcitrant cancer (Warrell et al. J. Natl. Cancer Inst.. 1998, 90,1621-<br><br>
1625). At this time, eleven human HDACs, which use zinc as a cofactor, have been<br>
identified (Taunton et al. Science 1996,272,408-411; Yang et al. J. Biol. Chem. 1997, 272,<br>
28001-28007. Grozinger et al Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.SA. 1999,96,4868-4873; Kao et al.<br>
Genes Dev. 2000,14, 55-66. Hu et al. J. Biol Chem. 2000,275,15254-15264; Zhou et al.<br>
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.SA. 2001,98,10572-10577; Venter etal Science 2001,291, 1304-<br>
1351) these members fall into three classes (class I, II, and III). An additional seven HDACs<br>
have been identified which use NAD as a confactor. To date, no small molecules are known<br>
that selectively target either the two classes or individual members of this family ((for<br>
example ortholog-selective HDAC inhibitors have been reported: Meinke et al. J. Med.<br>
Chem. 2000,14, 4919-4922; Meinke, etal. Curr. Med. Chem. 2001, 8, 211-235).<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
[0004J       The present invention provides novel bifunctional or multifunctional histone<br>
deacetylase inhibitors and methods of preparing and using these compounds. These<br>
compounds are particularly useful in the treatment of proliferative disease such as cancer.<br>
Certain compounds may be particularly useful in specifically inhibiting one class or member<br>
of HDACs. Certain compounds may be particularly useful in specifically inhibiting other<br>
deacetylation enzymes such as tubulin deacetylase (TDAC).<br>
[0005]       The present invention provides novel inhibitors of HDACs based on the<br>
observation that histone deacetylases form dimeric units in some cases and that some HDACs<br>
have two catalytic domains (e.g., HDAC6 has two functionally active HDAC domains, and<br>
HDAC10 has one functionally active HDAC domain and one truncated inactive HDAC<br>
domain). Histone deacetylases form both homodimers and heterodimers. Therefore, the<br>
compounds of the invention are generally two functional groups known to inhibit histone<br>
deacetylase (eg., zinc chelating moieties) linked together covalently via a tinker moiety. The<br>
compounds of the invention may also include more than two functional groups known to<br>
inhibit HDACs. Trimeric, multimeric, and polymeric compounds are considered part of the<br>
invention. In certain embodiments, the inhibitory functional groups are known to bind the<br>
Zn+2 ion found in the catalytic site of HDACs. Exemplary functional groups known to inhibit<br>
HDACs include:<br><br><br>
When the inventive compound is bifunctional, the inventive compound may be two of the<br>
same inhibitory functional groups linked together, or it may comprises two different<br>
functional groups linked together. So too with trimeric, multimeric, or polymeric<br>
compounds, the compound may comprises the same inhibitory functional groups or different<br>
inhibitory functional groups. Certain preferred inhibitory functional groups include<br>
hydroxamic acids, cinnamic hydroxamic acids, thiols, carboxlic acids, and ortho-<br>
aminoanilides. In certain embodiments, at least one of the inhibitory functional groups is<br>
hydroxamic acid. In other embodiments, at least one of the inhibitory functional groups is an<br>
ortho-aminoanilide. In yet other embodiments, at least one of the inhibitory functional<br>
groups is a thiol-containing functional group. Pro-drug or protected forms of these functional<br>
groups (e.g., esters) may also be used in the inventive compounds.<br>
[0006]      The present invention provides novel compounds of the general formula (I),<br>
wherein <br>
A comprises a functional group that inhibits histone deacetylase;<br>
B comprises a functional group that inhibits histone deacetylase, wherein A and B<br>
may be the same or different; and<br>
L is a linker covalently binding together A and B; and<br>
and pharmaceutical compositions thereof. The compounds of the invention are described<br>
generally and in subclasses herein. These compounds are useful particularly as inhibitors of<br><br>
HDACs, and thus are useful for the treatment of proliferative diseases (e.g., cancer, benign<br>
neoplasms, diabetic retinopathy, inflammatory diseases, angiogenesis, infectious diseases).<br>
The compounds may also be useful in treating skin disorders such as hair loss and skin<br>
hyperpigmentation. The inventive compounds are additionally useful as tools to probe<br>
biological function (e.g., the dimerization of histone deacetylases).<br>
[0007]       In another aspect, the present invention provides methods for inhibiting histone<br>
deacetylase activity in a patient or a biological sample, comprising administering to the<br>
patient, or contacting the biological sample with an effective inhibitory amount of an<br>
inventive compound. In still another aspect, the present invention provides methods for<br>
treating skin disorders involving histone deacetylase activity, comprising administering<br>
topically to a subject in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the<br>
invention, wherein the compound includes an esterase-senstive bond (e.g., an ester bond).<br>
The invention also provides kits for using the inventive compounds in the clinic or in a<br>
research setting.<br>
[0008]       In yet another aspect, the present invention provides methods for preparing<br>
compounds of the invention and intermediates thereof.<br>

"heteroaryl" refers to a planar ring comprising at least on eheteroatom, having p-orbitals<br>
perpendicular to the plane of the ring at each ring atom, and satisfying the Huckel rule where<br>
the number of pi electrons in the ring is (4n+2) wherein n is an integer.<br><br>
[0020]      It will also be appreciated that aryl and heteroaryl moieties, as defined herein may<br>
be attached via an alkyl or heteroalkyl moiety and thus also include -(alkyl)aryl, -<br>
(heteroalkyl)aryl, -(heteroalkyl)heteroaryl, and (heteroalkyl)heteroaryl moieties. Thus, as<br>
used herein, the phrases "aryl or heteroaryl moieties" and "aryl, heteroaryl, (alkyl)aryl, -<br>
(heteroalkyl)aryl, -(heteroalkyl)heteroaryl, and (heteroalkyl)heteroaryl" are interchangeable.<br>
Substituents include, but are not limited to, any of the previously mentioned substituents, i.e.,<br>
the substituents recited for aliphatic moieties, or for other moieties as disclosed herein,<br>
resulting in the formation of a stable compound.<br>
[00211       The term "aryl", as used herein, does not differ significantly from the common<br>
meaning of the term in the art, and refers to an unsaturated cyclic moiety comprising at least<br>
one aromatic ring. In certain embodiments, "aryl" refers to a. mono- or bicyclic carbocyclic<br>
ring system having one or two aromatic rings including, but not limited to, phenyl, naphthyl,<br>

[0023]       It will be appreciated that aryl and heteroaryl groups (including bicyclic aryl<br>
groups) can be unsubstituted or substituted, wherein substitution includes replacement of one<br>
or more of the hydrogen atoms thereon independently with any one or more of the following<br>
moieties including, but not limited to: aliphatic; alicyclic; heteroaliphatic; heterocyclic;<br>
aromatic; heteroaromatic; aryl; heteroaryl; alkylaryl; heteroalkylaryl; alkylheteroaryl;<br>

[0035]       The phrase, "pharmaceutically acceptable derivative", as used herein, denotes any<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, or salt of such ester, of such compound, or any other<br>
adduct or derivative which, upon administration to a patient, is capable of providing (directly<br>
or indirectly) a compound as otherwise described herein, or a metabolite or residue thereof.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thus include among others pro-drugs. A pro-drug is<br>
a derivative of a compound, usually with significantly reduced pharmacological activity,<br>
which contains an additional moiety, which is susceptible to removal in vivo yielding the<br>
parent molecule as the pharmacologically active species. An example of a pro-drug is an<br><br>
ester, which is cleaved in vivo to yield a compound of interest. Pro-drugs of a variety of<br>
compounds, and materials and methods for derivatizing the parent compounds to create the<br>
pro-drugs, are known and may be adapted to the present invention. Pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable derivatives also include "reverse pro-drugs." Reverse pro-drugs, rather than being<br>
activated, are inactivated upon absorption. For example, as discussed herein., many of the<br>
ester-containing compounds of the invention are biologically active but are inactivated upon<br>
exposure to certain physiological environments such as a blood, lymph, serum, extracellular<br>
fluid, etc. which contain esterase activity. The biological activity of reverse pro-drags and<br>
pro-drugs may also be altered by appending a functionality onto the compound, which may<br>
be catalyzed by an enzyme. Also, included are oxidation and reduction reactions, including<br>
enzyme-catalyzed oxidation and reduction reactions. Certain exemplary pharmaceutical<br>
compositions and pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives will be discussed in more detail<br>
herein below.<br>
[0036]       By the term "protecting group", has used herein, it is meant that a particular<br>
functional moiety, e.g., O, S, or N, is temporarily blocked so that a reaction can be carried out<br>
selectively at another reactive site in a multifunctional compound. In preferred embodiments,<br>
a protecting group reacts selectively in good yield to give a protected substrate that is stable<br>
to the projected reactions; the protecting group must be selectively removed in good yield by<br>
readily available, preferably nontoxic reagents that do not attack the other functional groups;<br>
the protecting group forms an easily separable derivative (more preferably without the<br>
generation of new stereogenic centers); and the protecting group has a minimum of additional<br>
functionality to avoid further sites of reaction. As detailed herein, oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen<br>
and carbon protecting groups may be utilized. For example, in certain embodiments, as<br>
detailed herein, certain exemplary oxygen protecting groups are utilized. These oxygen<br>
protecting groups include, but are not limited to methyl ethers, substituted methyl ethers (e.g.,<br>
MOM (methoxymethyl ether), MTM (methylthiomethyl ether), BOM (benzyloxymethyl<br>
ether), PMBM or MPM (p-methoxybenzyloxymethyl ether), to name a few), substituted ethyl<br>
ethers, substituted benzyl ethers, silyl ethers (e.g., TMS (trimethylsilyl ether), TES<br>
(triethylsilylether), TIPS (triisopropylsilyl ether), TBDMS (t-butyldimethylsilyl ether),<br>
tribenzyl silyl ether, TBDPS (t-butyldiphenyl silyl ether), to name a few), esters (e.g.,<br>
formate, acetate, benzoate (Bz), trifluoroacetate, dichloroacetate, to name a few), carbonates,<br>
cyclic acetals and ketals. In certain other exemplary embodiments, nitrogen protecting<br>
groups are utilized. These nitrogen protecting groups include, but are not limited to,<br>
carbamates (including methyl, ethyl and substituted ethyl carbamates (e.g., Troc), to name a<br><br>
few) amides, cyclic imide derivatives, N-Alkyl and N-Aryl amines, imine derivatives, and<br>
enamine derivatives, to name a few. Certain other exemplary protecting groups are detailed<br>
herein, however, it will be appreciated that the present invention is not intended to be limited<br>
to these protecting groups; rather, a variety of additional equivalent protecting groups can be<br>
readily identified using the above criteria and utilized in the present invention. Additionally,<br>
a variety of protecting groups are described in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Third<br>

contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
[0037]      The term "solid support", as used herein, refers to a material having a rigid or<br>
semi-rigid surface. Such materials will preferably take the form of small beads, pellets, disks,<br>
chips, dishes, multi-well plates, glass slides, wafers, or the like, although other forms may be<br>
used. In some embodiments, at least one surface of the substrate will be substantially fiat<br>
The term "surface" refers to any generally two-dimensional structure on a solid substrate and<br>
may have steps, ridges, kinks,, terraces, and the like without ceasing to be a surface.<br>
[0038]       The term "linker," as used herein, refers to a chemical moiety utilized to attach a<br>
functional group (e.g., an HDAC inhibitor functional group) to another functional group to<br>
prepare the inventive compounds. Exemplary linkers are described herein. It will be<br>
appreciated that other linkers that are known in the art can also be employed for the synthesis<br>
of the compounds of the invention.<br>
[0039]       "Compound": The term "compound" or "chemical compound" as used herein can<br>
include organometallic compounds, organic compounds, metals, transitional metal<br>
complexes, and small molecules. In certain preferred embodiments, polynucleotides are<br>
excluded from the definition of compounds. In other preferred embodiments,<br>
polynucleotides and peptides are excluded from the definition of compounds. In a<br>
particularly preferred embodiment, the term compounds refers to small molecules (e.g.,<br>
preferably, non-peptidic and non-oligomeric) and excludes peptides, polynucleotides,<br>
transition metal complexes, metals, and organometallic compounds.<br>
[0040]       "Small Molecule": As used herein, the term "small molecule" refers to a non-<br>
peptidic, non-oligomeric organic compound either synthesized in the laboratory or found in<br>
nature. Small molecules, as used herein, can refer to compounds that are "natural product-<br>
like", however, the term "small molecule" is not limited to "natural product-like"<br>
compounds. Rather, a small molecule is typically characterized in that it contains several<br>
carbon-carbon bonds, and has a molecular weight of less than 2000 g/mol, preferably less<br>
than 1500 g/mol, although this characterization is not intended to be limiting for the purposes<br><br>
of the present invention. Small molecules are typically characterized by multiple carbon-<br>
carbon bonds and may have one or more stereocenters. Examples of "small molecules" that<br>
occur in nature include, but are not limited to, taxol, dynemicin, and rapamycin. Examples of<br>
"small molecules" that are synthesized in the laboratory include, but are not limited to,<br>
compounds described by Tan et al ("Stereoselective Synthesis of over Two Million<br>
Compounds Having Structural Features Both Reminiscent of Natural Products and<br>
Compatible with Miniaturized Cell-Based Assays" J. Am. Chem. Soc. 120:8565, 1998;<br>
incorporated herein by reference). In certain other preferred embodiments, natural-product-<br>
like small molecules are utilized. In certain embodiments, the small molecule is not<br>
polymeric or oligomeric. In certain embnodiments, the small molecule is not a nucleic acid,<br>
protein, or peptide.<br>
[0041]       "Natural Product-Like Compound": As used herein, the term "natural product-<br>
like compound" refers to compounds that are similar to complex natural products which<br>
nature has selected through evolution.  Typically, these compounds contain one or more<br>
stereocenters, a high density and diversity of functionality, and a diverse selection of atoms<br>
within one structure. In this context, diversity of functionality can be defined as varying the<br>
topology, charge, size, hydrophilicity, hydrophobicity, and reactivity to name a few, of the<br>
functional groups present in the compounds. The term, "high density of functionality", as<br>
used herein, can preferably be used to define any molecule that contains preferably three or<br>
more latent or active diversifiable functional moieties. These structural characteristics may<br>
additionally render the inventive compounds functionally reminiscent of complex natural<br>
products, in that they may interact specifically with a particular biological receptor, and thus<br>
may also be functionally natural product-like.<br>
[0042]       "Metal chelator": As used herein, the term "metal chelator" refers to any<br>
molecule or moiety mat is is capable of forming a complex (i.e., "chelates") with a metal ion.<br>
In certain exemplary embodiments, a metal chelator refers to to any molecule or moiety that<br>
"binds" to a metal ion, in solution, making it unavailable for use in chemical/enzymatic<br>
reactions. In certain embodiments, the solution comprises aqueous environments under<br>
physiological conditions. Examples of metal ions include, but are not limited to, Ca2+, Fe3+,<br>
Zn2+, Na+, etc. In certain embodiments, the metal chelator bind Zn2+, which is found at the<br>
active site of HDACs. In certain embodiments, molecules of moieties that precipitate metal<br>
ions are not considered to be metal chelators.<br>
[0043]      As used herein the term "biological sample" includes, without limitation, cell<br>
cultures or extracts thereof; biopsied material obtained from an animal (e.g., mammal) or<br><br>
extracts thereof; and blood, saliva, urine, feces, semen, tears, or other body fluids or extracts<br>
thereof. For example, the term "biological sample" refers to any solid or fluid sample<br>
obtained from, excreted by or secreted by any living organism., including single-celled micro <br>
organisms (such as bacteria and yeasts) and multicellular organisms (such as plants and<br>
animals, for instance a vertebrate or a mammal, and in particular a healthy or apparently<br>
healthy human subject or a human patient affected by a condition or disease to be diagnosed<br>
or investigated). The biological sample can be in any form, including a solid material such as<br>
a tissue, cells, a cell pellet, a cell extract, cell homogenates, or cell fractions; or a biopsy, or a<br>
biological fluid. The biological fluid may be obtained from any site (e.g. blood, saliva (or a<br>
mouth wash containing buccal cells), tears, plasma, serum, urine, bile, cerebrospinal fluid,<br>
amniotic fluid, peritoneal fluid, and pleural fluid, or cells therefrom, aqueous or vitreous<br>
humor, or any bodily secretion), atransudate, an exudate (e.g. fluid obtained from an abscess<br>
or any other site of infection or inflammation), or fluid obtained from a joint (e.g. a normal<br>
joint or a joint affected by disease such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, gout or septic<br>
arthritis). The biological sample can be obtained from any organ or tissue (including a biopsy<br>
or autopsy specimen) or may comprise cells (whether primary cells or cultured cells) or<br>
medium conditioned by any cell, tissue or organ. Biological samples may also include<br>
sections of tissues such as frozen sections taken for histological purposes. Biological samples<br>
also include mixtures of biological molecules including proteins, lipids, carbohydrates and<br>
nucleic acids generated by partial or complete fractionation of cell or tissue homogenates.<br>
Although the sample is preferably taken from a human subject, biological samples may be<br>
from any animal, plant, bacteria, virus, yeast, etc. The term animal, as used herein, refers to<br>
humans as well as non-human animals, at any stage of development, including, for example,<br>
mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, worms and single cells. Cell cultures and live<br>
tissue samples are considered to be pluralities of animals. In certain exemplary embodiments,<br>
the non-human animal is a mammal (e.g., a rodent, a mouse, a rat, a rabbit, a monkey, a dog,<br>
a cat, a sheep, cattle, a primate, or a pig). An animal may be a transgenic animal or a human<br>
clone. If desired, the biological sample may be subjected to preliminary processing,<br>
including preliminary separation techniques.<br>

results in the cleavage of the substrate by trypsin, releasing a fluorescent probe. Fluorescent<br>
detection is measured continuously, and enzymatic activity is calculated in the linear range.<br>
[0064]      Figure 21 shows a method of determining synergy between compounds. Library<br>
plates are established for each compound (compound 1, yellow), representing dilutions as<br>
indicated. Pin transfer of the library plate of compound 1 and library plate of compound 2<br>
(inverted) establishes the plate map on the right. Four replicates of each compound are<br>
represented, including the full intersecting matrix of all concentrations of both compounds.<br>
This platform can be used rapidly to assemble biological activity data of diverse phenotypes<br><br>
(cell death, biochemical activity, etc.). Data are then processed using a novel template and<br>
reported using the median effect principle.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
[0068]       As discussed above, there remains a need for the development of novel<br>
deacetylase inhibitors. In particular HDAC inhibitors that are more potent and/or more<br>
specific than known HDAC inhibitors. HDAC inhibitors specific for a certain class or<br>
member of the HDAC family would be particularly useful both, in the treatment of<br>
proliferative diseases and in the study of HDACs. The present invention provides novel<br>
compounds, and methods for the synthesis thereof, which compounds are useful as inhibitors<br>
of HDACs, and thus are useful for the treatment of proliferative diseases.<br>
Compounds of the Invention<br>
[0069]       As discussed above, the present invention provides a novel class of compounds<br>
useful for the treatment of proliferative conditions such as cancer. In certain embodiments,<br>
the compounds of the present invention are useful as inhibitors of histone deacetylases and<br>
thus are useful as anti-cancer agents, and thus may be useful in the treatment of cancer, by<br>
effecting tumor cell death or inhibiting the growth of tumor cells. In certain exemplary<br>
embodiments, the inventive anticancer agents are useful in the treatment of cancers and other<br>
proliferative disorders, including, but not limited to breast cancer, cervical cancer, colon and<br>
rectal cancer, leukemia (ALL, AML, CML, CLL, etc.), lung cancer, melanoma, multiple<br>
myeloma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, and<br>
gastric cancer, to name a few. In certain embodiments, the inventive anticancer agents are<br>
active against leukemia cells and melanoma cells, and thus are useful for the treatment of<br>
leukemias (e.g., myeloid, lymphocytic, myelocytic and lymphoblastic leukemias) and<br><br>
malignant melanomas. Additionally, the inventive compounds may also be useful in the<br>
treatment of protozoal infections. In certain exemplary embodiments, the compounds of the<br>
invention are useful for disorders resulting from histone deacetylation activity. In certain<br>
embodiments, the compounds are useful foT skin disorders. Examplary skin disorders that<br>
may be treated using the inventive compounds include cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL),<br>
psoriasis, hair loss, dermatitis, neurofibromatosis, skin pigmentation, etc.<br>

polymorphs of compound of any general formula above forming part of this invention. For<br>
example, different polymorphs may be identified and/or prepared using different solvents, or<br>
different mixtures of solvents for recrystallization; by performing crystallizations at different<br>
temperatures; or by using various modes of cooling, ranging from very fast to very slow<br>
cooling during crystallizations. Polymorphs may also be obtained by heating or melting the<br>
compound followed by gradual or fast cooling. The presence of polymorphs may be<br>
determined by solid probe NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, differential scanning<br>
calorimetry, powder X-ray diffractogram and/or other techniques. Thus, the present<br>
invention encompasses inventive compounds, their derivatives, their tautomeric forms, their<br>
stereoisomers, their polymorphs, their pharmaceutically acceptable salts their<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable solvates and pharmaceutically acceptable compositions<br>
containing them.<br>
Synthetic Overview<br>
[00217]     The synthesis of the various monomeric compounds used to prepare the<br>
bifunctional, multifunctional, and polyfunctional compounds of the invention are known in<br>
the art. These published syntheses may be utilized to prepare the compounds! of the<br>
invention. In one embodiment, the monomeric units are prepared or obtained and two of<br>
more of the units are linked together using linker known in the art. In certain embodiments,<br>
functional groups on the monomeric units may be activated to form a covalent attachment<br>
with the linker moiety. In other embodiments, an activated functional group on the linker is<br>
used to form a covalent attachment to the monomeric unit In certain embodiments, the bond<br>
formed is an ester or amide bond. The syntheses of the monomeric units used in preparing<br>
the inventive bifunctional or multifunctional compounds are described in US 6,960,685; US<br>
6,897,220; US 6,541,661; US 6,512,123; US 6,495,719; US 2006/0020131; US 2004/087631;<br>
US 2004/127522; US 2004/0072849; US 2003/0187027; WO 2005/018578; WO<br>
2005/007091; WO 2005/007091; WO 2005/018578; WO 2004/046104; WO 2002/89782;<br>
each of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[00218]     In certain emobidments, a bifunctional linker moiety is reacted with two<br>
equivalents of monomeric units. In certain specific embodiments, the bifunctional linker<br><br>
includes two activated eletrophilic moieties such as activated esters. The electrophilic<br>
moieties are reacted with a nucleophilic moiety of the monomeric unit as shown below. In<br>
certain specific embodiments, the bifunctional linker includes two aldhyde moieities which<br>
are reacted with a hydrazine moiety of the monomeric unit. In other embodiments, the<br>
bifunctional linker includes two nucleophilic moieties (e.g., thiols, alcohols, amines). The<br>
nucleophilic moieties are reacted with electrophiles of the monomeric units. In certan<br>
embodiments, the electrophiles is an actived acyl moiety. As would be appreciated by one of<br>
skill in this art various of functional groups of the bifunctional linker and/or monomeric units<br>
may be optionally protected.<br><br>
[00219]     In certain embodiments, the inventive bifunctional compounds are constructed<br>
using click chemistry (e.g., Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddtion; Diels-Alder reaction; other<br>
cylcoaddition reactions; nucleophilic substitution; urea formation, amide formation, ester<br>
formation; epoxide opening; etc.). In certain particular embodiments, the bifunctional<br>
compounds are constructed using the azide-alkyne Huisgen 1,3-cycloaddition reaction as<br>
shown below. For example the monomeric unit may contain a alkynyl moiety that is reacted<br>
with an azide moiety of the bifunctional linker to form a triazole moiety. In other<br>
embodiments, the monomeric unit includes the azide moiety, and the bifunctional linker<br>
includes the alkynyl moiety. As would be appreciated by those of skill in the art, various<br>
functional groups of the linker and/or monomeric units may be optionally protected during<br>
the cycloaddition reaction and subsequently deprotected.<br><br>
[00220]     Exemplary syntheses of bifunctional HDAC inhibitors are shown in Figures 7, 8,<br>
and 23.<br><br>
Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
[00221]    As discussed above, the present invention provides novel compounds having<br>
antitumor and antiproliferative activity, and thus the inventive compounds are useful for the<br>
treatment of cancer.<br>
[00222]     Accordingly, in another aspect of the present invention, pharmaceutical<br>
compositions are provided, which comprise any one of the compounds described herein (or a<br>
prodrug, pharmaceutically acceptable salt or other pharmaceutically acceptable derivative<br>
thereof), and optionally comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In certain<br>
embodiments, these compositions optionally further comprise one or more additional<br>
therapeutic agents. Alternatively, a compound of this invention may be administered to a<br>
patient in need thereof in combination with the administration of one or more other<br>
therapeutic agents. For example, additional therapeutic agents for conjoint administration or<br>
inclusion in a pharmaceutical composition with a compound of this invention may be an<br>
approved chemotherapeutic agent, or it may be any one of a number of agents undergoing<br>
approval in the Food and Drug Administration that ultimately obtain approval for the<br>
treatment of protozoal infections and/or any disorder associated with cellular<br>
hyperproliferation. In certain other embodiments, the additional therapeutic agent is an<br>
anticancer agent, as discussed in more detail herein. In certain other embodiments, the<br>
compositions of the invention are useful for the treatment of protozoal infections.<br>
[00223]     It will also be appreciated that certain of the compounds of present invention can<br>
exist in free form for treatment, or where appropriate, as a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
derivative thereof. According to the present invention, a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
derivative includes, but is not limited to, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters, salts of<br>
such esters, or a pro-drug or other adduct or derivative of a compound of this invention which<br>
upon administration to a patient in need is capable of providing, directly or indirectly, a<br>
compound as otherwise described herein, or a metabolite or residue thereof.<br>
[00224]    As used herein, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" refers to those salts<br>
which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the<br>
tissues of humans and lower animals without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response and<br>
the like, and are commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. Pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts of amines, carboxylic acids, and other types of compounds, are well known<br>
in the art. For example, S.M. Berge, et al. describe pharmaceutically acceptable salts in<br>
detail in J. Pharmaceutical Sciences, 66:1-19 (1977), incorporated herein by reference. The<br>
salts can be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of the compounds of<br><br>
the invention, or separately by reacting a free base or free acid function with a suitable<br>
reagent, as described generally below. For example, a free base function can be reacted with a<br>
suitable acid. Furthermore, where the compounds of the invention carry an acidic moiety,<br>
suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may, include metal salts such as alkali<br>
metal salts, e.g. sodium or potassium salts; and alkaline earth metal salts, e.g. calcium or<br>
magnesium salts. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable, nontoxic acid addition salts are<br>
salts of an amino group formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic<br>
acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid and perchloric acid or with organic acids such as acetic<br>
acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, succinic acid or malonic acid or by<br>
using other methods used in the art such as ion exchange. Other pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salts include adipate, alginate, ascorbate, aspartate, benzenesulfonate, benzoate, bisulfate,<br>
borate, butyrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, citrate, cyclopentanepropionate, digluconate,<br>
dodecylsulfate, ethanesulfonate, formate, fumarate, glucoheptonate, glycerophosphate,<br>
gluconate, hernisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, hydroiodide, 2-hydroxy-ethanesulfonate,<br>
lactobionate, lactate, laurate, lauryl sulfate, malate, maleate, malonate, methanesulfonate, 2-<br>
naphthalenesulfonate, nicotinate, nitrate, oleate, oxalate, palmitate, pamoate, pectinate,<br>
persulfate, 3-phenylpropionate, phosphate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, stearate, succinate,<br>
sulfate, tartrate, thiocyanate, p-toluenesulfonate, undecanoate, valerate salts, and the like.<br>
Representative alkali or alkaline earth metal salts include sodium, lithium, potassium,<br>
calcium, magnesium, and the like. Further pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, when<br>
appropriate, nontoxic ammonium, quaternary ammonium, and amine cations formed using<br>
counterions such as halide, hydroxide, carboxylate, sulfate, phosphate, nitrate, loweralkyl<br>
sulfonate and aryl sulfonate.<br>
[00225]     Additionally, as used herein, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable ester" refers<br>
to esters that hydrolyze in vivo and include those that break down readily in the human body<br>
to leave the parent compound or a salt thereof. Suitable ester groups include, for example,<br>
those derived from pharmaceutically acceptable aliphatic carboxylic acids, particularly<br>
alkanoic, alkenoic, cycloalkanoic and alkanedioic acids, in which each alkyl or alkenyl<br>
moeity advantageously has not more than 6 carbon atoms. Examples of particular esters<br>
include formates, acetates, propionates, butyrates, acrylates and ethylsuccinates.<br>
[00226]     Furthermore, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs" as used herein<br>
refers to those prodrugs of the compounds of the present invention which are, within the<br>
scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the issues of humans and<br>
lower animals with undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response, and the like, commensurate<br><br>
with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio, and effective for their intended use, as well as the<br>
zwitterionic forms, where possible, of the compounds of the invention. The term "prodrug"<br>
refers to compounds that are rapidly transformed in vivo to yield the parent compound of the<br>
above formula, for example by hydrolysis in blood. A thorough discussion is provided in T.<br>
Higuchi and V. Stella, Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems, Vol. 14 of the A.C.S.<br>
Symposium Series, and in Edward B. Roche, ed., Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design,<br>
American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987, both of which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[00227]     As described above, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention<br>
additionally comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which, as used herein, includes<br>
any and all solvents, diluents, or other liquid vehicle, dispersion or suspension aids, surface<br>
active agents, isotonic agents, thickening or emulsifying agents, preservatives, solid binders,<br>
lubricants and the like, as suited to the particular dosage form desired. Remington's<br>
Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sixteenth Edition, E. W. Martin (Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa.,<br>
1980) discloses various carriers used in formulating pharmaceutical compositions and known<br>
techniques for the preparation thereof. Except insofar as any conventional carrier medium is<br>
incompatible with the compounds of the invention, such as by producing any undesirable<br>
biological effect or otherwise interacting in a deleterious manner with any other<br>
component(s) of the pharmaceutical composition, its use is contemplated to be within the<br>
scope of this invention. Some examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carriers include, but are not limited to, sugars such as lactose, glucose and sucrose;<br>
starches such as corn starch and potato starch; cellulose and its derivatives such as sodium<br>
carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate; powdered tragacanth; malt;<br>
gelatine; talc; excipients such as cocoa butter and suppository waxes; oils such as peanut oil,<br>
cottonseed oil; safflower oil, sesame oil; olive oil; corn oil and soybean oil; glycols; such as<br>
propylene glycol; esters such as ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; agar; buffering agents such as<br>
magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; alginic acid; pyrogenfree water; isotonic<br>
saline; Ringer's solution; ethyl alcohol, and phosphate buffer solutions, as well as other non-<br>
toxic compatible lubricants such as sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate, as well as<br>
coloring agents, releasing agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming<br>
agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the composition, according to<br>
the judgment of the formulator.<br>
[00228]     Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include, but are not limited to,<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and<br><br>
elixirs. In addition to the active compounds, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert<br>
diluents commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing<br>
agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate,<br>
benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethylformamide,<br>
oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils),<br>
glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan,<br>
and mixtures thereof. Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants<br>
such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, and<br>
perfuming agents.<br>
[00229]     Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous<br>
suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or<br>
wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile<br>
injectable solution, suspension or emulsion in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or<br>
solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and<br>
solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, U.S.P. and isotonic sodium<br>
chloride solutioa In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or<br>
suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including<br>
synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid are used in the<br>
preparation of injectables.<br>
[00230]     The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a<br>
bacterial-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid<br>
compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable<br>
medium prior to use.<br>
[00231]     In order to prolong the effect of a drug, it is often desirable to slow the absorption<br>
of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the<br>
use of a liquid suspension or crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility.<br>
The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution that, in turn, may<br>
depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a<br>
parenterally administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in<br>
an oil vehicle. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the<br>
drug in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio<br>
of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release<br>
can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include (poly(orthoesters) and<br><br>
poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in<br>
liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissues.<br>
[00232]     Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories<br>
which can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with suitable non-irritating<br>
excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which<br>
are solid at ambient temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the<br>
rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound.<br>
[00233]     Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills,<br>
powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is mixed with at<br>
least one inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier such as sodium citrate or<br>
dicalcium phosphate and/or a) fillers or extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose,<br>
mannitol, and silicic acid, b) binders such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates,<br>
gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidinone, sucrose, and acacia, c) humectants such as glycerol, d)<br>
disintegrating agents such as agar—agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic<br>
acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate, e) solution retarding agents such as paraffin, f)<br>
absorption accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds, g) wetting agents such as,<br>
for example, cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate, h) absorbents such as kaolin and<br>
bentonite clay, and i) lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid<br>
polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules,<br>
tablets and pills, the dosage form may also comprise buffering agents.<br>
[00234]     Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and<br>
hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high<br>
molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like. The solid dosage forms of tablets,<br>
dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric<br>
coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may<br>
optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the<br>
active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally,<br>
in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions that can be used include<br>
polymeric substances and waxes. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed<br>
as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar<br>
as well as high molecular weight polethylene glycols and the like.<br>
[00235]     The active compounds can also be in micro-encapsulated form with one or more<br>
excipients as noted above. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and<br>
granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings, release controlling<br><br>
coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. In such solid<br>
dosage forms the active compound may be admixed with at least one inert diluent such as<br>
sucrose, lactose and starch. Such dosage forms may also comprise, as in normal practice,<br>
additional substances other than inert diluents, e.g., tableting lubricants and other tableting<br>
aids such as magnesium stearate and microcrystalline cellulose. In the case of capsules,<br>
tablets and pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents. They may optionally<br>
contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active<br>
ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a<br>
delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric<br>
substances and waxes.<br>
[00236]     The present invention encompasses pharmaceutically acceptable topical<br>
formulations of inventive compounds. The term "pharmaceutically acceptable topical<br>
formulation", as used herein, means any formulation which is pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
for intradermal administration of a compound of the invention by application of the<br>
formulation to the epidermis. In certain embodiments of the invention, the topical formulation<br>
comprises a carrier system. Pharmaceutically effective carriers include, but are not limited to,<br>
solvents (e.g., alcohols, poly alcohols, water), creams, lotions, ointments, oils, plasters,<br>
liposomes, powders, emulsions, microemulsions, and buffered solutions (e.g., hypotonic or<br>
buffered saline) or any other carrier known in the art for topically administering<br>
Pharmaceuticals. A more complete listing of art-known carriers is provided by reference texts<br>
that are standard in the art, for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 16th Edition,<br>
1980 and 17th Edition, 1985, both published by Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., the<br>
disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. In certain other<br>
embodiments, the topical formulations of the invention may comprise excipients. Any<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable excipient known in the art may be used to prepare the inventive<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable topical formulations. Examples of excipients that can be<br>
included in the topical formulations of the invention include, but are not limited to,<br>
preservatives, antioxidants, moisturizers, emollients, buffering agents, solubilizing agents,<br>
other penetration agents, skin protectants, surfactants, and propellants, and/or additional<br>
therapeutic agents used in combination to the inventive compound. Suitable preservatives<br>
include, but are not limited to, alcohols, quaternary amines, organic acids, parabens, and<br>
phenols. Suitable antioxidants include, but are not limited to, ascorbic acid and its esters,<br>
sodium bisulfite, burylated hydroxytoluene, butylated hydroxyanisole, tocopherols, and<br>
chelating agents like EDTA and citric acid Suitable moisturizers include, but are not limited<br><br>
to, glycerine, sorbitol, polyethylene glycols, urea, and propylene glycol. Suitable buffering<br>
agents for use with the invention include, but are not limited to, citric, hydrochloric, and<br>
lactic acid buffers. Suitable solubilizing agents include, but are not limited to, quaternary<br>
ammonium chlorides, cyclodextrins, benzyl benzoate, lecithin, and polysorbates. Suitable<br>
skin protectants that can be used in the topical formulations of the invention include, but are<br>
not limited to, vitamin E oil, allatoin, dimethicone, glycerin, petrolatum, and zinc oxide.<br>
[00237]    In certain embodiments, the pharmaceuticaily acceptable topical formulations of<br>
the invention comprise at least a compound of the invention and a penetration enhancing<br>
agent. The choice of topical formulation will depend or several factors, including the<br>
condition to be treated, the physicochemical characteristics of the inventive compound and<br>
other excipients present, their stability in the formulation, available manufacturing<br>
equipment, and costs constraints. As used herein the term " penetration enhancing agent "<br>
means an agent capable of transporting a pharmacologically active compound through the<br>
stratum corneum and into the epidermis or dermis, preferably, with little or no systemic<br>
absorption. A wide variety of compounds have been evaluated as to their effectiveness in<br>
enhancing the rate of penetration of drugs through the skin. See, for example, Percutaneous<br>
Penetration Enhancers, Maibach H. L and Smith H. E. (eds.), CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton,<br>
Fla. (1995), which surveys the use and testing of various skin penetration enhancers, and<br>
Buyuktimkin et al, Chemical Means of Transdermal Drug Permeation Enhancement in<br>
Transdermal and Topical Drug Delivery Systems, Gosh T. K., Pfister W. R., Yum S. I.<br>
(Eds.), Interpharm Press Inc., Buffalo Grove, III. (1997). In certain exemplary embodiments,<br>
penetration agents for use with the invention include, but are not limited to, triglycerides<br>
{e.g., soybean oil), aloe compositions (e.g., aloe-vera gel), ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol,<br>
octolyphenylpolyethylene glycol, oleic acid, polyethylene glycol 400, propylene glycol, N-<br>
decylmethylsulfoxide, fatty acid esters (e.g., isopropyl myristate, methyl laurate, glycerol<br>
monooleate, and propylene glycol monooleate) and N-methyl pyrrolidone.<br>
[00238]     In certain embodiments, the compositions may be in the form of ointments, pastes,<br>
creams, lotions, gels, powders, solutions, sprays, inhalants or patches. In certain exemplary<br>
embodiments, formulations of the compositions according to the invention are creams, which<br>
may further contain saturated or unsaturated fatty acids such as stearic acid, palmitic acid,<br>
oleic acid, palmito-oleic acid, cetyl or oleyl alcohols, stearic acid being particularly preferred.<br>
Creams of the invention may also contain a non-ionic surfactant, for example, polyoxy-40-<br>
stearate. In certain embodiments, the active component is admixed under sterile conditions<br>
with a pharmaceuticaily acceptable carrier and any needed preservatives or buffers as may be<br><br>
required. Ophthalmic formulation, eardrops, and eye drops are also contemplated as being<br>
within the scope of this invention. Additionally, the present invention contemplates the use<br>
of transdermal patches, which have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of a<br>
compound to the body. Such dosage forms are made by dissolving or dispensing the<br>
compound in the proper medium. As discussed above, penetration enhancing agents can also<br>
be used to increase the flux of the compound across the skin. The rate can be controlled by<br>
either providing a rate controlling membrane or by dispersing the compound in a polymer<br>
matrix or gel.<br>
[00239]     It will also be appreciated that the compounds and pharmaceutical compositions<br>
of the present invention can be formulated and employed in combination therapies, that is, the<br>
compounds and pharmaceutical compositions can be formulated with or administered<br>
concurrently with, prior to, or subsequent to, one or more other desired therapeutics or<br>
medical procedures. The particular combination of therapies (therapeutics or procedures) to<br>
employ in a combination regimen will take into account compatibility of the desired<br>
therapeutics and/or procedures and the desired therapeutic effect to be achieved. It will also<br>
be appreciated that the therapies employed may achieve a desired effect for the same disorder<br>
(for example, an inventive compound may be administered concurrently with another<br>
immunomodulatory agent, anticancer agent or agent useful for the treatment of psoriasis), or<br>
they may achieve different effects (e.g., control of any adverse effects).<br>
[00240]     For example, other therapies or anticancer agents that may be used in combination<br>
with the inventive compounds of the present invention include surgery, radiotherapy (in but a<br>
few examples, y-radiation, neutron beam radiotherapy, electron beam radiotherapy, proton<br>
therapy, brachytherapy, and systemic radioactive isotopes, to name a few), endocrine therapy,<br>
biologic response modifiers (interferons, interleukins, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) to<br>
name a few), hyperthermia and cryotherapy, agents to attenuate any adverse effects (e.g.,<br>
antiemetics), and other approved chemotherapeutic drugs, including, but not limited to,<br>
alkylating drugs (mechlorethamine, chlorambucil, Cyclophosphamide, Melphalan,<br>
Ifosfamide), antimetabolites (Methotrexate), purine antagonists and pyrimidine antagonists<br>
(6-Mercaptopurine, 5-Fluprouracil, Cytarabile, Gemcitabine), spindle poisons (Vinblastine,<br>
Vincristine, Vinorelbine, Paclitaxel), podophyllotoxins (Etoposide, Irinotecan, Topotecan),<br>
antibiotics (Doxorubicin, Bleomycin, Mitomycin), nitrosoureas (Carmustine, Lomustine),<br>
inorganic ions (Cisplatin, Carboplatin), enzymes (Asparaginase), and hormones (Tamoxifen,<br>
Leuprolide, Flutamide, and Megestrol), to name a few. For a more comprehensive discussion<br><br>
of updated cancer therapies see, The Merck Manual, Seventeenth Ed. 1999, the entire<br>
contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. See also the National Cancer<br>
Institute (CM) website (www.nci.nih.gov) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)<br>
website for a list of the FDA approved oncology drugs<br>
(www.fda. gov/cder/cancer/druglistframe).<br>
[00241]     In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention<br>
further comprise one or more additional therapeutically active ingredients (e.g.,<br>
chemotherapeutic and/or palliative). For purposes of the invention, the term "Palliative"<br>
refers to treatment that is focused on the relief of symptoms of a disease and/or side effects of<br>
a therapeutic regimen, but is not curative. For example, palliative treatment encompasses<br>
painkillers, antinausea medications and anti-sickness drugs. In addition, chemotherapy,<br>
radiotherapy and surgery can all be used palliatively (that is, to reduce symptoms without<br>
going for cure; e.g., for shrinking tumors and reducing pressure, bleeding, pain and other<br>
symptoms of cancer).<br>
[00242]     Additionally, the present invention provides pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
derivatives of the inventive compounds, and methods of treating a subject using these<br>
compounds, pharmaceutical compositions thereof, or either of these in combination with one<br>
or more additional therapeutic agents.<br>
[00243]     It will also be appreciated that certain of the compounds of present invention can<br>
exist in free form for treatment, or where appropriate, as a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
derivative thereof. According to the present invention, a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
derivative includes, but is not limited to, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters, salts of<br>
such esters, or a prodrug or other adduct or derivative of a compound of this invention which<br>
upon administration to a patient in need is capable of providing, directly or indirectly, a<br>
compound as otherwise described herein, or a metabolite or residue thereof.<br>
Research Uses, Pharmaceutical Uses and Methods of Treatment<br>

Pharmaceutical Uses and Methods of Treatment<br>
[00247]     In general, methods of using the compounds of the present invention comprise<br>
administering to a subject in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a compound<br>
of the present invention. As discussed above, the compounds of the invention are selective<br>
inhibitors of histone deacetylases and, as such, are useful in the treatment of disorders<br>
modulated by histone deacetylases. For example, compounds of the invention may be useful<br>
in the treatment of cancer. Accordingly, in yet another aspect, according to the methods of<br>
treatment of the present invention, tumor cells are killed, or their growth is inhibited by<br>
contacting said tumor cells with an inventive compound or composition, as described herein.<br>
[00248]     Thus, in another aspect of the invention, methods for the treatment of cancer are<br>
provided comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of an inventive<br><br>
compound, as described herein, to a subject in need thereof. In certain embodiments, a<br>
method for the treatment of cancer is provided comprising administering a therapeutically<br>
effective amount of an inventive compound, or a pharmaceutical composition comprising an<br>
inventive compound to a subject in need thereof, in such amounts and for such time as is<br>
necessary to achieve the desired result In certain embodiments of the present invention a<br>
"therapeutically effective amount" of the inventive compound or pharmaceutical composition<br>
is that amount effective for killing or inhibiting the growth of tumor cells. The compounds<br>
and compositions, according to the method of the present invention, may be administered<br>
using any amount and any route of administration effective for killing or inhibiting the<br>
growth of tumor cells. Thus, the expression "amount effective to kill or inhibit the growth of<br>
tumor cells," as used herein, refers to a sufficient amount of agent to kill or inhibit the growth<br>
of tumor cells. The exact amount required will vary from subject to subject, depending on the<br>
species, age, and general condition of the subject, the severity of the infection, the particular<br>
anticancer agent, its mode of administration, and the like.<br>
[00249]     In certain embodiments, the method involves the administration of a<br>
therapeutically effective amount of the compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative<br>
thereof to a subject (including, but not limited to a human or animal) in need of it In certain<br>
embodiments, the inventive compounds as useful for the treatment of cancer (including, but<br>
not limited to, glioblastoma, retinoblastoma, breast cancer, cervical cancer, colon and rectal<br>
cancer, leukemia, lymphoma, lung cancer (including, but not limited to small cell lung<br>
cancer), melanoma and/or skin cancer, multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, ovarian<br>
cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer and gastric cancer, bladder cancer, uterine cancer,<br>
kidney cancer, testicular cancer, stomach cancer, brain cancer, liver cancer, or esophageal<br>
cancer).<br>
[00250]     In certain embodiments, the inventive anticancer agents are useful in the treatment<br>
of cancers and other proliferative disorders, including, but not limited to breast cancer,<br>
cervical cancer, colon and rectal cancer, leukemia, lung cancer, melanoma, multiple<br>
myeloma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, and<br>
gastric cancer, to name a few. In certain embodiments, the inventive anticancer agents are<br>
active against leukemia cells and melanoma cells, and thus are useful for the treatment of<br>
leukemias (e.g., myeloid, lymphocytic, myelocytic and lymphoblastic leukemias) and<br>
malignant melanomas. In still other embodiments, the inventive anticancer agents are active<br>
against solid tumors.<br><br>
[00251]     In certain embodiments, the inventive compounds also find use in the prevention<br>
of restenosis of blood vessels subject to traumas such as angioplasty and stenting. For<br>
example, it is contemplated that the compounds of the invention will be useful as a coating<br>
for implanted medical devices, such as tubings, shunts, catheters, artificial implants, pins,<br>
electrical implants such as pacemakers, and especially for arterial or venous stents, including<br>
balloon-expandable stents. In certain embodiments inventive compounds may be bound to an<br>
implantable medical device, or alternatively, may be passively adsorbed to the surface of the<br>
implantable device. In certain other embodiments, the inventive compounds may be<br>
formulated to be contained within, or, adapted to release by a surgical or medical device or<br>
implant, such as, for example, stents, sutures, indwelling catheters, prosthesis,, and the like.<br>
For example, drugs having antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory activities have been<br>
evaluated as stent coatings, and have shown promise in preventing retenosis (See, for<br>
example, Presbitero P. et al., "Drug eluting stents do they make the difference?", Minerva<br>
Cardioangiol, 2002, 50(5):431-442; Ruygrok P.N. et al., "Rapamycin in cardiovascular<br>
medicine", Intern. Med. J., 2003,33(3):103-109; and Marx S.O. et al, "Bench to bedside: the<br>
development of rapamycin and its application to stent restenosis", Circulation, 2001,<br>
104(8):852-855, each of these references is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).<br>
Accordingly, without wishing to be bound to any particular theory, Applicant proposes that<br>
inventive compounds having antiproliferative effects can be used as stent coatings and/or in<br>
stent drug delivery devices, inter alia for the prevention of restenosis or reduction of<br>
restenosis rate. Suitable coatings and the general preparation of coated implantable devices<br>
are described in US Patents 6,099,562; 5,886,026; and 5,304,121. The coatings are typically<br>
biocompatible polymeric materials such as a hydrogel polymer, polymethyldisiloxane,<br>
polycaprolactone, polyethylene glycol, polylactic acid, ethylene vinyl acetate,, and mixtures<br>
thereof. The coatings may optionally be further covered by a suitable topcoat of<br>
fluorosilicone, polysaccarides, polyethylene glycol, phospholipids or combinations thereof to<br>
impart controlled release characteristics in the composition. A variety of compositions and<br>
methods related to stent coating and/or local stent drug delivery for preventing restenosis are<br>
known in the art (see, for example, U.S. Patent Nos.: 6,517,889; 6,273,913; 6,258,121;<br>
6,251,136; 6,248,127; 6,231,600; 6,203,551; 6,153,252; 6,071,305; 5,891,507; 5,837,313 and<br>
published U.S. patent application No.: US2001/0027340, each of which is incorporated<br>
herein by reference in its entirety). For example, stents may be coated with polymer-drug<br>
conjugates by dipping the stent in polymer-drug solution or spraying the stent with such a<br>
solution. In certain embodiment, suitable materials for the implantable device include<br><br>
biocompatible and nontoxic materials, and may be chosen from the metals such as nickel-<br>
titanium alloys, steel, or biocompatible polymers, hydrogels, polyurethanes, polyethylenes,<br>
ethylenevinyl acetate copolymers, etc. In certain embodiments, the inventive compound is<br>
coated onto a stent for insertion into an artery or vein following balloon angioplasty.<br>
[00252]     The compounds of this invention or pharmaceutically acceptable compositions<br>
thereof may also be incorporated into compositions for coating implantable medical devices,<br>
such as prostheses, artificial valves, vascular grafts, stents and catheters. Accordingly, the<br>
present invention, in another aspect, includes a composition for coating an implantable device<br>
comprising a compound of the present invention as described generally above, and in classes<br>
and subclasses herein, and a carrier suitable for coating said implantable device. In still<br>
another aspect, the present invention includes an implantable device coated with a<br>
composition comprising a compound of the present invention as described generally above,<br>
and in classes and subclasses herein, and a carrier suitable for coating said implantable<br>
device.<br>
[00253]     Within other aspects of the present invention, methods are provided for expanding<br>
the lumen of a body passageway, comprising inserting a stent into the passageway, the stent<br>
having a generally tubular structure, the surface of the structure being coated with (or<br>
otherwise adapted to release) an inventive compound or composition, such that the<br>
passageway is expanded. In certain embodiments, the lumen of a body passageway is<br>
expanded in order to eliminate a biliary, gastrointestinal, esophageal, tracheal/bronchial,<br>
urethral and/or vascular obstruction.<br>
[00254]     Methods for eliminating biliary, gastrointestinal, esophageal, tracheal/bronchial,<br>
urethral and/or vascular obstructions using stents are known in the art. The skilled<br>
practitioner will know how to adapt these methods in practicing the present invention. For<br>
example, guidance can be found in U.S. Patent Publication No.: 2003/0004209 in paragraphs<br>
[0146]-[0155], which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[00255]     Another aspect of the invention relates to a method for inhibiting the growth of<br>
multidrug resistant cells in a biological sample or a patient, which method comprises<br>
administering to the patient, or contacting said biological sample with a compound of the<br>
invention or a composition comprising said compound.<br>
[00256]     Additionally, the present invention provides pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
derivatives of the inventive compounds, and methods of treating a subject using these<br>
compounds, pharmaceutical compositions thereof, or either of these in combination with one<br>
or more additional theraDeutic agents.<br><br>
[00257]     Another aspect of the invention relates to a method of treating or lessening the<br>
severity of a disease or condition associated with a proliferation disorder in a patient, said<br>
method comprising a step of administering to said patient, a compound of formula I or a<br>
composition comprising said compound.<br>
[00258]     It will be appreciated that the compounds and compositions, according to the<br>
method of the present invention, may be administered using any amount and any route of<br>
administration effective for the treatment of cancer and/or disorders associated with cell<br>
hyperproliferation. For example, when using the inventive compounds for the treatment of<br>
cancer, the expression "effective amount" as used herein, refers to a sufficient amount of<br>
agent to inhibit cell proliferation, or refers to a sufficient amount to reduce the effects of<br>
cancer. The exact amount required will vary from subject to subject, depending on the<br>
species, age, and general condition of the subject, the severity of the diseases, the particular<br>
anticancer agent, its mode of administration, and the like.<br>
[00259]     The compounds of the invention are preferably formulated in dosa.ge unit form for<br>
ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. The expression "dosage unit form" as used<br>
herein refers to a physically discrete unit of therapeutic agent appropriate for the patient to be<br>
treated. It will be understood, however, that the total daily usage of the compounds and<br>
compositions of the present invention will be decided by the attending physician within the<br>
scope of sound medical judgment. The specific therapeutically effective dose level for any<br>
particular patient or organism will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder<br>
being treated and the severity of the disorder; the activity of the specific compound<br>
employed; the specific composition employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and<br>
diet of the patient; the time of administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion of<br>
the specific compound employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination or<br>
coincidental with the specific compound employed; and like factors well known in the<br>
medical arts (see, for example, Goodman and Gilman's, "The Pharmacological Basis of<br>
Therapeutics", Tenth Edition, A. Gilman, J.Hardman and L. Limbird, eds., McGraw-Hill<br>
Press, 155-173,2001, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).<br>
[00260]     Another aspect of the invention relates to a method for inhibiting histone<br>
deacetylase activity in a biological sample or a patient, which method comprises<br>
administering to the patient, or contacting said biological sample with a compound of formula<br>
I or a composition comprising said compound.<br>
[00261]     Furthermore, after formulation with an appropriate pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carrier in a desired dosage, the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention can be<br><br>
administered to humans and other animals orally, rectally, parenterally, intracisternally,<br>
intravaginally, intraperitoneally, topically (as by powders, ointments, creams or drops),<br>
bucally, as an oral or nasal spray, or the like, depending on the severity of the infection being<br>
treated. In certain embodiments, the compounds of the invention may be administered at<br>
dosage levels of about 0.001 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg, from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 25<br>
mg/kg, or from about 0.1 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg of subject body weight per day, one or<br>
more times a day, to obtain the desired therapeutic effect. It will also be appreciated that<br>
dosages smaller than 0.001 mg/kg or greater than 50 mg/kg (for example 50-100 mg/kg) can<br>
be administered to a subject. In certain embodiments, compounds are administered orally or<br>
parenterally.<br>
Assay<br>
[00262]     In another aspect, the invention provides a biochemical assay for identifying<br>
inhibitors of deacetylase activity. The assay may be performed in a high-throughput format<br>
For example, the assay may be performed in a multi-well plate format. The assay may be<br>
modified to screen for inhibitors of particular HDACs or TDACs. In certain embodiments,<br>
the assay is used to identify inhibitors of HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, HDAC4, HDAC5,<br>
HDAC6, HDAC7, HDAC8, HDAC9, HDAC10, or HDAC11. In certain embodiments,<br>
HDAC6 is used in the assay. Test compounds may be screened against multiple HDACs in<br>
order to determine their selectivity. A target substrate is incubated with an HDAC or other<br>
protein with deacetylase activity in the presence of a test compound. In certain embodiments,<br>
the target substrate includes an acetylated lysine residue. Deacetylation of the substrate<br>
allows trypsin or another protease to cleave the substrate, thereby releasing a fluorescent<br>
probe. Fluorescence can be continuously monitored in order to determine the ability of the<br>
test compound to inhibit the deacetylation activity. The HDAC or other enzyme may be<br>
purified or used crude in the inventive assay. In certain embodiments, the assay is a cell-free<br>
assay. The assay is illustrated in Figure 20.<br>
Treatment Kit<br>
[00263]     In other embodiments, the present invention relates to a kit for conveniently and<br>
effectively carrying out the methods in accordance with the present invention. In general, the<br>
pharmaceutical pack or kit comprises one or more containers filled with one or more of the<br>
ingredients of the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention. Such kits are especially<br>
suited for the delivery of solid oral forms such as tablets or capsules. Such a kit preferably<br><br>
includes a number of unit dosages, and may also include a card having the dosages oriented<br>
in the order of their intended use. If desired, a memory aid can be provided, for example in<br>
the form of numbers, letters, or other markings or with a calendar insert, designating the days<br>
in the treatment schedule in which the dosages can be administered. Alternatively, placebo<br>
dosages, or calcium dietary supplements, either in a form similar to or distinct from the<br>
dosages of the pharmaceutical compositions, can be included to provide a kit in which a<br>
dosage is taken every day. Optionally associated with such container(s) can be a notice in the<br>
form prescribed by a governmental agency regulating the manufacture, use or sale of<br>
pharmaceutical products, which notice reflects approval by the agency of manufacture, use or<br>
sale for human administration.<br>

Example 2: Biological Assay Procedures<br>
[00273]     Cell culture and Transfections. TAg-Jurkat cells were transfected by<br>
electroporation with 5 ug of FLAG-epitope-tagged pBJ5 constructs for expression of<br>
recombinant proteins. Cells were harvested 48 h posttransfection.<br>
[00274]     HDAC assays. [3H]Acetate-incorporated histones were isolated from butyrate-<br>
treated HeLa cells by hydroxyapatite chromatography (as described in Tong, et al. Nature<br>
1997, 395, 917-921.) Immunoprecipitates were incubated with 1.4 µg (10,000 dpm) histones<br>
for 3 h at 37° C. HDAC activity was determined by scintillation counting of the ethyl<br>
acetate-soluble [3H]acetic acid (as described in Taunton, et al., Science 1996, 272, 408-411).<br>
Compounds were added in DMSO such that final assay concentrations were 1% DMSO.<br>
IC50S were calculated using Prism 3.0 software. Curve fitting was done without constraints<br>
using the program's Sigmoidal-Dose Response parameters. All data points were acquired in<br>
duplicate and IC50s are calculated from the composite results of at least two separate<br>
experiments.<br>
Example 3: In vivo activity<br>
[00275]     Although a variety of methods can be utilized, one exemplary method by which<br>
the in vivo activity of the inventive compounds is determined is by subcutaneously<br>
transplanting a desired tumor mass in mice. Drug treatment is then initiated when tumor<br>
mass reaches approximately 100 mm3 after transplantation of the tumor mass. A suitable<br>
composition, as described in more detail above, is then administered to the mice, preferably<br>
in saline and also preferably administered once a day at doses of 5, 10 and 25 mg/kg,<br>
although it will be appreciated that other doses can also be administered. Body weight and<br>
tumor size are then measured daily and changes in percent ratio to initial values are plotted.<br>
In cases where the transplanted tumor ulcerates, the weight loss exceeds 25-30% of control<br>
weight loss, the tumor weight reaches 10% of the body weight of the cancer-bearing mouse,<br>
or the cancer-bearing mouse is dying, the animal is sacrificed in accordance with guidelines<br>
for animal welfare.<br><br>
