				<td>Technical Field<br>
[1 ]	The present invention relates to a liquid crystal display (LCD). More particularly,<br>
the present invention relates to an in-plane switching liquid crystal display (IPS-LCD)<br>
including a compensation film employing at least one A-plate while adjusting an<br>
optical axis direction and a retardation value thereof in order to improve a viewing<br>
angle characteristic of the IPS-LCD filled with liquid crystal of positive dielectric<br>
anisotropy (Δ ε &gt;0) or negative dielectric anisotropy ( Δ ε
Background Art<br>
[2]	IPS-LCDs are disclosed in US Patent No. 3,807,831, but this patent does not<br>
disclose the use of viewing-angle compensation films. IPS-LCDs including no<br>
viewing-angle compensation films have a disadvantage in that they have a low contrast<br>
ratio due to a relatively great amount of light leakage in the dark state at inclination<br>
angle.<br>
Disclosure<br>
[3]	It is an object of the present invention to provide an IPS-LCD representing a<br>
superior contrast characteristic and a low color shift at a front and at a predetermined<br>
inclination angle of the IPS-LCD by minimizing light leakage in a black state of the<br>
IPS-LCD at the predetermined inclination angle.<br>
[4]	The viewing angle characteristic of the IPS-LCD may be lowered due to a<br>
dependency of an orthogonality between the absorption axes of two polarizer plates to<br>
the viewing angle and a dependency of a birefringence of an IPS-LCD panel to the<br>
viewing angle.<br>
[5]	The present inventors have found that +A-plates with an optical axis direction and<br>
a retardation value adjusted according to an alignment order thereof are necessary to<br>
solve the above problems lowering the viewing angle characteristic of the IPS-LCD.<br>
On the basis of this finding, the present invention has been completed.<br>
6]	Accordingly, the present invention provides an in-plane switching liquid crystal<br>
display comprising: a first polarizer plate; a liquid crystal cell, which is filled with<br>
liquid crystal of positive dielectric anisotropy (Δ ε &gt;0) or negative dielectric<br>
anisotropy ( Δ ε 
being aligned in-plane in parallel to a polarizer plate; and a second polarizer plate,<br>
wherein an absorption axis of the first polarizer plate is perpendicular to an absorption<br><br>
axis of the second polarizer plate, and the optical axis of the liquid crystal filled in the<br>
liquid crystal cell is parallel to the absorption axis of the first polarizer plate, wherein<br>
at least one A-plate is interposed between the polarizer plate and the liquid crystal cell<br>
in order to compensate for a viewing angle, and an optical axis direction and an in-<br>
plane retardation value of the A-plate are adjusted according to an alignment order of<br>
the A-plate.<br>
[7]	The present invention is characterized by using upper and lower polarizer plates<br>
and at least one A-plate with the optical axis direction and the retardation value thereof<br>
adjusted according to the alignment order to the A-plate in order to compensate for the<br>
viewing angle of the IPS-LCD in the black state.<br>
[8 J	The contrast ratio value is an index representing a degree of definition for an<br>
image, and a higher contrast ratio value allows a higher definition image. The IPS-<br>
LCD presents the lowest contrast characteristic at an inclination angle of 70 ° . If the<br>
contrast characteristic of the IPS-LCD can be improved at the inclination angle of 70 °<br>
, the contrast characteristic of the IPS-LCD can be improved at all viewing angles.<br>
When the IPS-LCD exclusively uses the polarizer plate, a minimum contrast ratio<br>
value of the IPS-LCD at the inclination angle of 70 ° is identical to or less than 10:1.<br>
The present invention can improve the minimum contrast ratio value by using the A-1<br>
plate.<br>

Mode for Invention<br>
[ 19]	Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention.<br>
[20]	FIG. 1 is a view illustrating a basic structure of an IPS-LCD.<br>
[21 ]	The IPS-LCD includes a First polarizer plate, a second polarizer plate and a liquid<br>
crystal cell. An absorption axis 4 of the First polarizer plate is aligned in perpendicular<br>
to the an absorption axis 5 of the second polarizer plate and the absorption axis 4 of the<br>
first polarizer plate is parallel to an optical axis 6 of liquid crystal of an IPS-panel. In<br>
FIG. 2, two absorption axes 4 and 5 of two polarizer plates and one optical axis 6 of<br>
the liquid crystal are shown.<br>
[22]	The liquid crystal display using a compensation Film according to the present<br>
invention includes the first polarizer plate 1, the liquid crystal cell 3, which is Homo-<br>
geneously aligned between two glass substrates and Filled with liquid crystal of<br>
positive dielectric anisotropy ( Δ ε 
the second polarizer plate 2. The optical axis 6 of the liquid crystal filled in the liquid<br>
crystal cell is aligned in-plane in parallel to the first and second polarizer plates 1 and<br>
2. The absorption axis 4 of the First polarizer plate 1 is aligned in perpendicular to the<br>
absorption axis 5 of the second polarizer plate 2 and the absorption axis 4 of the first<br>
polarizer plate 1 is parallel to the optical axis 6 of the liquid crystal filled in the IPS-<br>
panel. In addition, according to the liquid crystal display of the present invention, one<br>
of first and second substrates 15 and 16 includes an active matrix drive electrode<br>
having a pair of electrodes, which is formed on a surface of the substrate adjacent to a<br>
liquid crystal layer.<br>
[23]	A retardation value of the liquid crystal layer formed in the liquid crystal cell of the<br>
IPS-LCD according to the present invention is preferably 200nm to 350nm at a<br>
wavelength of 550nm.<br>
[24]	In order to obtain the white state when voltage is applied to the IPS-panel, light<br>
which is linearly polarized at an angle of 90 ° by passing through the first polarizer<br>
plate must be linearly polarized at an angle of 0 ° by passing through the liquid crystal<br>
layer. To this end, the retardation value of the liquid crystal layer of the IPS-panel must<br>
be set to a half of 589nm, wherein 589nm is a wavelength of monochromatic light<br>
providing highest brightness for people. In order to obtain a white color, the retardation<br>
value of the liquid crystal layer can be adjusted slightly shorter than or longer than the<br>
half of the 589nm. Therefore, preferably, the liquid crystal layer has the retardation<br>
value of about 295nm, which is about a half of the 589nm.<br><br>
[25]	The LCD according to the present invention may align the liquid crystal in mu lti-<br>
domains, or the liquid crystal may be divided into multi-domains as voltage is applied<br>
thereto.<br>
[26]	The LCDs can be classified into IPS (In-Plane Switching) LCDs, Super-IPS<br>
(Super-In-Plane Switching) LCDs and FFS (Fringe-Field Switching) LCDs according<br>
to modes of the active matrix drive electrode including a pair of electrodes. In the<br>
present invention, the IPS-LCD may include the Super-IPS LCD, the FFS LCD, or a<br>
reverse TN IPS LCD.<br>
[27]	FIG. 3 illustrates a refractive index of a retardation film used for compensating for<br>
a viewing angle of the IPS-LCD. Referring to FIG. 3, an in-plane refractive index in an<br>
x-axis direction having a higher refractive index is n (8), an in-plane refractive index in<br>
a y-axis direction having a smaller refractive index is n (9), and a thickness refractive<br>
y<br>
index in a z-axis direction is n (10). Depending on the magnitudes of the refractive<br>
indexes, the characteristics of the retardation films will be determined.<br>
[28]	A film where the refractive indexes in the two-axis directions among the refractive<br>
indexes in the three-axis directions are different from each other is referred to as an<br>
uniaxial film. A film with n &gt; n -n is referred to as a positive A-plate, the in-plane<br>
x	v	r<br>
retardation value of which is defined using the difference between two refractive<br>
indexes lying in a plane, and the thickness of the film as given in the following<br>
equation 1.<br>
[29]	(Equation 1)<br>
[30]	R =dx(n -n ) wherein d represents the thickness of the film.<br>
in	x	y<br>
[31 ]	FIGS. 4 to 8 show structures of viewing angle compensation films including the A-<br>
plate according to the present invention.<br>
[32]	An IPS-panel 3 is interposed between two orthogonal polarizer plates 1 and 2,<br>
wherein liquid crystal molecules 7 of the IPS-panel are aligned in parallel to an IPS-<br>
LCD panel substrate in a rubbing direction, which is formed on the substrate by<br>
surface-treating the substrate such that liquid crystal molecules are aligned in one<br>
direction.<br>
[33]	In order to obtain the viewing angle compensation function, the retardation film<br>
must be interposed between the liquid crystal cell 3 and the polarizer plates.<br>
[34]	An optical axis (or a slow axis) of the retardation film is determined according to<br>
the structure of the retardation film. The optical axis of the retardation film can be<br>
aligned in perpendicular to or parallel to an absorption axis of an adjacent polarizer<br>
plate.<br>
[35]	The retardation value of the retardation film is determined according to an<br>
alignment order of the retardation film.<br>
[36]	FIGS. 4 to 7 show structures of the IPS-LCDs including the viewing angle com-<br><br>
pensalion films according to the present invention. Herein, it should be noted that a<br>
relative position between a backlight unit and an observer must not be inter-changed.<br>
The A-plate can be represented with a non-diagonalized matrix at a predetermined in-<br>
clination angle because the non-diagonalized matrix may output different results<br>
depending on a multiplication order.<br>
[37]	According to a first embodiment of the present invention, there is provided an LCD<br>
including an A-plate 11 interposed between a second polarizer plate 2 and a liquid<br>
crystal cell 3, wherein an optical axis 12 of the A-plate 11 is parallel to an absorption<br>
axis 5 of the second polarizer plate 2 and the A-plate 11 has an in-plane retardation<br>
value in a range of 250nm to 450nm at a wavelength of 550nm.<br>
(38]	In order to allow the A-plate to compensate for the retardation caused by the IPS-<br>
liquid crystal cell, the optical axis of the IPS-liquid crystal cell must be aligned perpen-<br>
dicularly to the optical axis of the A-plate in a black state of the IPS-LCD. Therefore,<br>
the optical axis 12 of the A-plate 11 must be aligned in parallel to the absorption axis 5<br>
of the second polarizer plate 2.<br>
[39]	The A-plate 11 has the in-plane retardation value in a range of 250nm to 450nm at<br>
a wavelength of 550nm due to the following reason.<br>
[40]	The IPS-liquid crystal cell interposed between the orthogonal polarizer plates is<br>
converted into the white state only when the light, which has been linearly polarized at<br>
an angle of 0 ° , is linearly polarized at an angle of 90 ° after passing through the liquid<br>
crystal cell when voltage is applied to the IPS-panel under the conditions in which the<br>
retardation value of the liquid crystal cell is a half ( λ/2) of 589nm and the optical axis<br>
of the liquid crystal cell is inclined at an angle of 45 ° with respect to the absorption<br>
axis of the polarizer plate. However, since the design value may vary depending on<br>
wavelength dispersion characteristics of the liquid crystal, the above function can be<br>
obtained only when the retardation value of the A-plate is in a range of 250nm to<br>
450nm.<br>
[41]	The first embodiment of the present invention is shown in FIG. 4.<br>
[42]	Table 1 shows a simulation result obtained from the first IPS-LCD structure as<br>
shown in FIG. 4 when the design value of the retardation film is actually applied to the<br>
first IPS-LCD structure.<br>
[43]	Table 1<br><br><br>
[44]	When the IPS-LCD exclusively uses the polarizer plate, the minimum contrast ratio<br>
value of the IPS-LCD is identical to or less than 10:1 at an inclination angle of 70 ° .<br>
Since the minimum contrast ratio value can be obtained in all viewing angles at the in-<br>
clination angle of 70 ° , the improvement of the contrast ratio value at the inclination<br>
angle of 70 ° means the improvement of the contrast ratio value in all viewing angles.<br>
[45]	Table 1 shows the improvement result of the viewing angle characteristic (contrast<br>
characteristic) by using the A-plate, in which the most superior viewing angle char-<br>
acteristic can be obtained when the minimum contrast ratio at the inclination angle of<br>
70 ° has a maximum value.<br>
[46]	According to a second embodiment of the present invention, there is provided an<br>
LCD including an A-plate 11 interposed between a second polarizer plate 2 and a<br>
liquid crystal cell 3, wherein an optical axis 12 of the A-plate 11 is perpendicular to an<br>
absorption axis 5 of the second polarizer plate 2 and the A-plate 11 has an in-plane re-<br>
tardation value in a range of 50nm to 150nm at a wavelength of 550nm.<br>
[47]	Herein, the optical axis 12 of the A-plate 11 must be perpendicular to the<br>
absorption axis 5 of the second polarizer plate 2 and the A-plate 11 must have the in-<br>
plane retardation value in a range of 50nm to 150nm at a wavelength of 550nm due to<br>
the following reason.<br>
[48]	When the optical axis of the IPS-liquid crystal cell is aligned in parallel to the<br>
optical axis of the A-plate, the total retardation value(sum of retardation value of IPS-<br>
Panel and A-Plate) is 3/4X. at a wavelength of 550nrn. In addition, if a 1/4 λ retardation<br>
film or a 3/4X retardation film is aligned perpendicularly to the absorption axis of the<br>
polarizer plate, light leakage generated at a predetermined inclination angle caused by<br>
the polarizer plates can be minimized. Therefore, in order to allow the A-plate to<br><br>
perform the above function together with the IPS-Liquid crystal cell, the A-plate is<br>
designed such that the total retardation value of the A-plate and the IPS-liquid crystal<br>
cell is set to 3/4 λ at the wavelength of 550nm. That is, since the design value may vary<br>
depending on the wavelength dispersion characteristics of the IPS-liquid Crystal cell<br>
and the A-plate, the retardation value of the A-plate is set to the above range in order to<br>
obtain the total retardation value of 3/4 λ.<br>
[49]	The second embodiment of the present invention is shown in FIG. 5.<br>
[50]	Table 2 shows a simulation result obtained from the second IPS-LCD structure as<br>
shown in FIG. 5 when the design value of the retardation film is actually applied to the<br>
second IPS-LCD structure.<br>
[51] <br>
[52]	According to a third embodiment of the present invention, there is provided an<br>
LCD including an A-plate 11 interposed between a first polarizer plate 1 and a liquid<br>
crystal cell 3, wherein an optical axis 12 of the A-plate 11 is parallel to an absorption<br>
axis 4 of the first polarizer plate 1 and the A-plate 11 has an in-plane retardation value<br>
in a range of 40nm to 150nm at a wavelength of 550nm.<br>
[53]	Herein, the optical axis 12 of the A-plate 11 must be parallel to the absorption axis<br>
4 of the first polarizer plate 1 and the A-plate 11 must have the in-plane retardation<br>
value in a range of 40nm to 150nm at a wavelength of 550nm due to the following<br>
reason.<br>
[54]	When the optical axis of the EPS-liquid crystal cell is aligned in parallel to the<br>
optical axis of the A-plate, the total retardation value is 3/4 λ at a wavelength of<br>
550nm. In addition, if a 1/4 λ retardation film or a 3/4 λ retardation film is aligned per-<br>
pendicularly to the absorption axis of the polarizer plate, light leakage generated at a<br>
predetermined inclination angle caused by the polarizer plates can be minimized.<br>
Therefore, in order to allow the A-plate to perform the above function together with<br>
the IPS-Liquid Crystal cell, the A-plate is designed such that the total retardation value<br><br>
of the A-plate and the IPS-liquid crystal cell is set to 3/4 λ at the wavelength of 550nm.<br>
That is, since the design value may vary depending on the wavelength dispersion char-<br>
acteristics of the IPS-liquid Crystal cell and the A-plate, the retardation value of the A-<br>
plate is set to the above range in order to obtain the total retardation value of 3/4 λ.<br>
[55]	The third embodiment of the present invention is shown in FIG. 6.<br>
[56]	Table 3 shows a simulation result obtained from the third IPS-LCD structure as<br>
shown in FIG. 6 when the design value of the retardation film is actually applied to the<br>
third IPS-LCD structure.<br>
[57] <br>
[58]	According to a fourth embodiment of the present invention, there is provided an<br>
LCD including a first A-plate 11 interposed between a first polarizer plate 1 and a<br>
liquid crystal cell 3 and a second A-plate 13 interposed between the liquid crystal cell<br>
3 and a second polarizer plate 2, wherein an optical axis 12 of the first A-plate 11 is<br>
parallel to an absorption axis 4 of the first polarizer plate I, an optical axis 14 of the<br>
second A-plate 13 is parallel to an absorption axis 5 of the second polarizer plate 2, the<br>
First A-plate 11 has an in-plane retardation value in a range of 100nm to 150nm at a<br>
wavelength of 550nm, and the second A-plate 13 has an in-plane retardation value in a<br>
range of 350nm to 450nm at a wavelength of 550nm.<br>
[59]	Herein, the optical axis 12 of the first A-plate 11 must be parallel to the absorption<br>
axis 4 of the first polarizer plate I, the optical axis 14 of the second A-plate 13 must be<br>
parallel to the absorption axis 5 of the second polarizer plate 2, the first A-plate 11<br>
must have the in-plane retardation value in a range of 100nm to 150nm at a wavelength<br>
of 550nm, and the second A-plate 13 must have the in-plane retardation value in a<br>
range of 350nm to 450nm at a wavelength of 550nm due to the following reason.<br>
[60]	In order to minimize light leakage caused by the orthogonal polarizer plates at a<br>
predetermined inclination angle by using the A-plate, a 1/4 λ retardation film or a 3/4 λ<br>
retardation film at the wavelength of 550nm is used. To this end, the first and second<br><br>
A-plates have the above retardation values such that the total retardation value of the<br>
IPS-liquid crystal cell, which is a kind of the A-plates, and the A-plates is set to 1/4 λ<br>
at the wavelength of 550nm. In the wavelength of 550nm, the first A-plate plays a role<br>
of a 1/4 λ A-plate, the IPS-liquid crystal cell plays a role of a 1/2 λ A-plate, and the<br>
second A-plate plays a role of a -1/2 λ A-plate. Accordingly, the total in-plane re-<br>
tardation value is set to 1/4 λ. That is, according to the fourth embodiment of the<br>
present invention, after forming an A-plate unit including the first and second A-plates<br>
and the IPS-liquid crystal cell such that the A-plate unit has the total in-plane re-<br>
tardation value of 1/4 λ, the A-plate unit is aligned perpendicularly to the absorption<br>
axis of the first polarizer plate.<br>
[61)	The fourth embodiment of the present invention is shown in FIG. 7.<br>
[62]	Table 4 shows a simulation result obtained from the fourth IPS-LCD structure as<br>
shown in FIG. 7 when the design value of the retardation film is actually applied to the<br>
third IPS-LCD structure.<br>
[63] <br>
[64]	According to a fifth embodiment of the present invention, there is provided an<br>
LCD including first and second A-plates 11 and 13 interposed between a second<br>
polarizer plate 2 and a liquid crystal cell 3, wherein the second A-plate film 13 is<br>
adjacent to the second polarizer plate 2, an optical axis (n )12 of the first A-plate 11 is<br>
perpendicular to an absorption axis 5 of the second polarizer plate 2, an optical axis 14<br>
of the second A-plate 13 is parallel to an absorption axis 5 of the second polarizer plate<br>
2, the first A-plate 11 has an in-plane retardation value in a range of 100nm to 150nm<br>
at a wavelength of 550nm, and the second A-plate 13 has an in-plane retardation value<br>
in a range of 350nm to 450nm at a wavelength of 550nm.<br>
[65]	Herein, the optical axis of the first A-plate must be perpendicular to the absorption<br>
axis 5 of the second polarizer plate 2, the optical axis 14 of the second A-plate 13 must<br>
be parallel to the absorption axis 5 of the second polarizer plate 2, the first A-plate 11<br><br>
must have the in-plane retardation value in a range of 100nm to I50nm at a wavelength<br>
of 550nm, and the second A-plate 13 must have the in-plane retardation value in a<br>
range of 350nm to 450nm at a wavelength of 550nm due to the following reason.<br>
[661	The first and second A-plates are designed such that the total retardation value of<br>
the IPS-liquid crystal cell and the first and second A-plates is set to 3/4 λ at the<br>
wavelength of 550nm. That is, at the wavelength of 550nm, the IPS-liquid crystal cell<br>
plays a role of a 1/2 \ A-plate, the first A-plate plays a role of a -1/4 λ A-plate, and the<br>
second A-plate plays a role of a 1/2 λ A-plate. That is, according to the fifth<br>
embodiment of the present invention, after forming an A-plate unit including the first<br>
and second A-plates and the IPS-liquid crystal cell such that the A-plate unit has the<br>
total in-plane retardation value of 3/4 λ, the A-plate unit is aligned perpendicularly to<br>
the absorption axis of the first polarizer plate, thereby minimizing light leakage at a<br>
predetermined inclination angle caused by the polarizer plates.<br>
[67]	The fifth embodiment of the present invention is shown in FIG. 8.<br>
[68]	Table. 5 shows a simulation result obtained from the fifth IPS-LCD structure as<br>
shown in FIG. 8 when the design value of the retardation film is actually applied to the<br>
third IPS-LCD structure.<br>
[69] <br>
[70]	The polarizer plates may include protective films used for protecting a polarizer<br>
element made from stretched PVA (polyvinyl alcohol) doped with iodine. In addition,<br>
the protective film can be made from TAC (triacetate cellulose) having a thickness re-<br>
tardation value, such as 400 TAC or 80 D TAC , PNB (polynorbomene) or COP (cyclo<br>
olefin) having no thickness retardation value. The viewing angle compensation char-<br>
acteristic of the IPS-LCD may be influenced by the protective film used for protecting<br>
the polarizer element.<br>
[71 ]	According to the present invention, the A-plate can be made from polymer or a<br>
cured liquid crystal film.<br>
[72]	In addition, according to the present invention, the A-plate film can be used as an<br><br>
internal protective film for at least one polarizer plate. Since the internal protective<br>
film of the polarizer plate is used for protecting the polarizer element, a transparent<br>
material having the polarizer element protecting function is used as the internal<br>
protective film. That is, since the A-plate is made from the transparent material having<br>
the polarizer element protecting function, the A-plate film can be used as a retardation<br>
film having the polarizer element protecting function.<br>
