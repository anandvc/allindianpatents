SECTION-10<br>
"AN ELECTRICAL POWER GENERATING PLANT USING KINETIC ENERGY OF WATER WAVES OR WATER FLOW"<br>
PATEL GHANSHYAMBHAI KANJIBHAI<br>
India National, residing at<br>
26, Viveknagar Society, Ranchodjivas,<br>
Amraiwadi, Ahmedabad-380 026<br>
Gujarat State, India.<br>
The  following   specification   particularly  describes  the   nature   of  this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
This invention relates to an Electrical power generating plant by sing kinetic energy of water waves or water flow.<br>
More particularly this invention relates to a novel plant to harness kinetic energy from tidal/sea waves or flowing water in rivers, canals and the like and converting/transforming the same into electrical power/energy, without leaving any adverse effect or marine life or environment.<br>
With the continuous development of civilization, electrical power remains in great demand and in several countries like India there is always a crises.<br>
For generating electricity there are existing thermal plants mainly using fossil fuels such as coals, petroleum products (liquid or gaseous fuels). Besides, these fuels are available in limited quantity, which may last in near future, (by 2040) all these plants are creating big environmental problems by releasing pollutants in the atmosphere. Some small thermal plants may be working on wood and agricultural waste, as a fuel, but these plants are also creating environmental problems. The above all the thermal plants are releasing Carbon dioxide in huge quantities which contribute towards global warming.<br>
Another type of plants existing for generating electricity are the hydro electricity plants which require big dams to be constructed across the river which results in to displacement is very exorbitant. A further type of electricity generating plants known in the prior art are nuclear power plants which besides being very costly are quite risky because of radiation<br>
2<br><br>
leakage being disastrous and at the same time technology involved in highly sophisticated.<br>
The topic of Human kind's need for renewable energy is becoming more and more well known. Mostly because the world needs a source of energy that will last longer than our limited supply of fossil fuels. Pollution is also a major issue, many environment list groups are pushing towards more Earth friendly sources of energy or civilization will come to a screeching halt around the year 2040. There are three main practical solutions to the energy crisis: Solar Power, Wind Power and Water Power. Work is continuously going on in all these fields. Solar Power and Wind Power is being used at some places to a limited extent. Water Power has great potential. There are different ways to harness the energy in water. The most common way of capturing water energy is hydro electrical power i.e. electricity generated by falling of water. The drawbacks or limitations of it has been described herein before.<br>
Another method of harnessing water's energy is using the temperature of ocean water in a thermal transfer process, one of the plant developed is known as ocean thermal energy Converter (OTEC). OTEC uses warm tropical waters to evaporate liquid that boils at a very low temperature such as ammonia or freon. The steam produced is forced through tubbiness to generate electricity. The gas is then placed in a storage tank where cold water from ocean floor is brought up to turn it back into liquid and then the process is repeated.<br>
In another design, warm surface water is passed in to an evaporator the pressure is lowered which causes water to vaporize. It is forced through a turbine to generate electricity. Cold water is piped<br>
3<br><br>
forced lower ocean depths to cool the vaporized water, to repeat the cycle.<br>
The main problem with these plants is that the pipe to collect cold water at lower depths kept braking off during storms and hence eventually abandoned. The new designs of OTEC are still mostly at experimental stage.<br>
A further type of plant using water wave energy are known as oscillating water column (OWC), when the wind hits the water, it transfers massive amount of potential energy to the water, some of which is captured by OWC. When waves hit as OWC, the air inside is compressed and forced through air turbines to generate electricity. The OWC'S are also still mostly experimental. An OWC in Norway when used was blown to sea during a heavy storm in 1998.<br>
A further form of such plants is known as "Salter Ducks", which floats and are connected in a chain of about 25, when they bob up and down in the water, a pump is driven and energy is created. These are also at study level only.<br>
A further type of such plants are called Tidal Mills or Tidal Power stations. In this a barrage is first set across a beach or river, when high tide comes in, water flows through turbines to generate electricity. Now some water is up behind the barrage. A gate is lowered from the barrage, capturing the water above it, when low tide comes, the gate is raised and the water flows out with two - way turbines. Tidal power stations are very expensive to build and have environmental problems as they destroy<br>
4<br><br>
homes to many birds and other animals. Fishes swim up to these stations and are killed by the turbines.<br>
The main object of this invention is to obviate the above mentioned draw backs of all the existing electrical power generating and to provide a novel electrical power generating plants by using kinetic energy available in abundance in sea waves or in flowing water of rivers, canals and like water streams.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a novel electrical power generating plants by using kinetic of water waves or water flow wherein there is no pollution or any adverse effect on environment or natural maricultural activities or no danger to fish or any such animals.<br>
A further object of this invention is to provide a novel electrical power generating plant by using kinetic energy of water waves or water flow which does not require permanent construction like RCC structure, which remains floating above the water level and provide mobility to the whole plant so that it can be shifted from one place to another and at the same time can be anchored easily at a desired location and structure being floating type remains protected from storms.<br>
A further object of this invention is to provide a novel electrical power generating plant by using kinetic energy of water waves or water flow without blocking the navigation, or interrupting the flow river or changing the location of the inter tidal zones and thereby helping in conservation of environment.<br>
5<br><br>
A further object of this invention is to provide a novel electrical power generating plant by using kinetic energy of water waves of water flow which is easy to built and maintain and does not involve any sophisticated technology, machine or other equipment, needing highly skilled specialists for constructing, using or maintaining the plant.<br>
A further object of this invention is to provide a novel electrical power generating plant by using kinetic energy of water waves or water flow which can be constructed in easy to assemble modular form thereby increasing or decreasing the area and capacity of the plant very easily according to the requirements from time to time or place to place.<br>
A further object of this invention is to provide a novel electrical power generating plant by using kinetic energy of water waves or water flow, which is comparatively cheaper, continues to harness water energy and converting the same in to electricity for a sufficiently long time without interruption, Cost of power generated is minimal and at the same time the power transmission costs and losses can be minimized.<br>

Referring to figs. 1 to 29, an electrical power generating plant by using kinetic energy of water waves or water flow in a water body such as ocean, sea, lake, pond, river, canal or the like, the said plant comprising a floating base (1) for supporting the said plant in floating state on the water surface in the water body. The floating base (1) mainly comprises one or more preferably, two barrels or similar tubular sections (2) preferably provided along the longitudinal sides (3) of the plant, in a spaced apart relationship. The distance (w) between the two longitudinal barrels (2) is kept according to the width of the plant. Length of each barrel (2) is selected according to the desired length (L) of the plant, which depends on the capacity of the plant.<br>
However these barrels along with other structure can be made in modular form and a number of modules can be connected in tandem as per requirement. The barrels are kept longitudinally parallel to water flow. The two open ends of each barrel (2) are closed by using end plates (4). Preferably the open end of each of the barrel (2), facing the water flow is closed by a cone (5) in order to reduce the water force on the barrel end.<br>
10<br><br>
The two barrels are inter connected by the plant and preventing the barrels diverging out at the bottom side of the plant. Barrels (2) being of a limited length may also be provided with flanges (7), for connecting a number of barrels in order to increase the length (L) of the plant, as per requirement. This also enables to reduce the length of the water waves in a water body. The floating base (1) provides mobility to the plant. That is the plant can be moved from place to place in the water body as well as at the same place it enables the plant, to move up and down to adjust with the water in the ocean, sea or lakes during high tides or low tides or during change of water flow, parameters in rivers or canals during flood or less flow. Further as the floating structure does not block the water waves/water flow and allows the water waves to move backward and forward direction the plant is safeguarded from damages during storms or floods. Though two numbers of the barrels (2) are shown in figures, but for increasing the width (W) more numbers of barrels (2) parallel to each other can be provided as per requirement. A pillar structure (8), preferably made of strong frame work, to provide more strength with less weight is rigidly fixed over each barrel (2), along its length. At the top portion (9) of the pillar structure (8) a plurality of roller assembles (10), having one pair or two pairs of rollers (11) and a runway (12) are provided in spaced apart relationship, along both the longitudinal sides of the plant. A continuous runway (12) is formed on both the longitudinal sides of the plant (as shown in fig. 2). A plurality of flappers (13) is provided in spaced apart relationship along the length of the plant, which are hanged from the roller assemblies (10) freely moving over the runway (12). Each of the flappers (13) is hanged across the water flow and is supported at its top at both ends in the said roller assemblies (10) engaging with the runways (12) at both longitudinal ends of the plant. The flapper (13) is made of a frame structure, like window frames, covered at both sides with plates and<br>
11<br><br>
provided with a pipe (14) at its top, The two ends of the flapper pipe (14) are rigidly connected to a pair of roller assemblies (10), one each, opposite to each other, on the runways (12) and thus the flappers can move smoothly along with the roller assemblies on the runways (12). To reduce the weight, the flappers are made of hollow frame, supporting the side plates, which are cut into 'V Shaper as shown in figure (12), as such the flappers are rigid and light in weight. A shown in fig. 15, the flapper (13) are made of large number of window frames, each of which is provided with an unidirectional flap valve (15) hinged with the help of hinges (16) to the window frame (17) at the top. The flap valve (15) is self opening and closing type. When the flapper is hanging downward flap valve closes by its own weight and when its lower free end moves, upward, the flap valve opens by its own weights, due to gravitational force. Also when water flow or water strikes the flapper in forward direction flap valve (15) remains closed and when the waves strike in reverse direction the flap valve is opened, unidirectional flap valve opening and closing in various positions are clearly illustrated in figs. 16, 17, 18,19 and 20.<br>
Figs. 21, 22 &amp; 23 show the roller assembly (10) provided with two rollers (11) instead of four, as shown in figs. 4, 5, and 6. As shown in figs. 7, 8 and 9, a pair of continuous chains (18) is fixed to the flapper pipe (14) and runs to the two longitudinal sides of the plant along the runways (12). A super structure (19) is mounted over the pillar structure (8), for supporting various electrical power generating and transmission systems. A pair of gears/spur wheels (20) mounted on a drive shaft (21) is provided in the super structure which engages and rotated with the chain (18). The drive shaft (21) is connected with electric generator/Dynamo (22) with the help of belt and pulley drive system (23). A flywheel (24) may also be provided<br>
12<br><br>
to regulate the rotational motion. The super structure (19) is also made of frame structure provided with bracing to make it a strong rigid structure with low weight.<br>
The flapper (13) along with floating base is the novel feature of this invention. While the floating base structure keeps the plant floating at the surface of the water body without interfering the flow of water or without interrupting the water waves or without affecting any navigation, mariculture or environment. The flapper (13) is made of a large number of windows provided with unidirectional flap valves (15). The novel feature of this invention is to harness the kinetic energy in water flow or water waves of a water body with the help of novel flappers (13) of this invention. The unidirectional flap vales (15) provided in the flapper are closed and opened by self weight. When water waves strike the flapper (13) the unidirectional flap valve (15) are closed and the wave energy striking the flapper, with its valve closed, moves the flapper with roller assembly (10) and chain (18) connected to the flapper pipe (14). The moving chain rotates the gears/spur wheels (20) with its shaft (21) which is turn rotates the electric generator/dynamo (22) with the help of belts and pulley drive (23) and thus the kinetic energy of the water waves is converted into electric power by the electric generator/dynamo (22) which is further transmitted with known electrical power transmission system. Novel construction of the flapper provides maximum water energy to be converted into electricity as it provides least resistance to water waves in reverse direction as well as it provides least resistance to winds. As shown in figure 16, water waves in forward direction, striking the flapper (13), with flap valves (15) in closed position, converts the kinetic energy in water waves to the maximum extent which moves the flapper with roller assembly and chain attached to the flapper top pipe  (14) and this<br>
13<br><br>
flapper movement is converted into electrical power through the generator (22). As shown in fig. 17, forward water waves at the upper level of water body, contribute to the motion of flapper, while reverse water waves at the lower level of water body opens the flap valves and pass back without much resistance. Similarly as shown in fig. 18, reverse water waves pass through opened flap valves, however in this position no motion will be transferred to the flapper but the chain will continue to rotate in clock wise direction due to the motion of the flapper (13), facing some other waves, like wise shown in figs- 16 and 17. Further as shown in fig. 19 wind velocity will not cause any resistance as flap valves will be opened to allow the wind to pass through flapper. The size of the flapper valves (15) may be kept smaller in the lower rows of the flapper, as the force of the water waves in reverse direction is comparatively less than the forward waves in upper level.<br>
Electricity generator/dynamo (22) is mounted on the super structure by using pedestal and rotating shafts are mounted through bearings in a known manner and are not illustrated and described in details. Similarly speed variation gear box flywheel, alternator, circuit breaker, frequency converter and PLC, step-up transformer and step down transformer, the auxillation controller, etc. may also be provided in the known manner, which are not illustrated and described.<br>
Further as and alternative shown in figs. 24, 25 and 26 for converting the flapper motion into electricity a rack and pinion system can be utilized. Dynamo (24) are attached to the flapper pipe (14), on its both ends, the shaft (25) of each dynamo is fitted with a pinion (26) which engages a rack (27) provided on the upper portion (9) of the pillar structure (8), at both the longitudinal sides of the plant. The electric power<br>
14<br><br>
generated by a number of dynamos (24) in collected a distributed in the known manner.<br>
As a further alternative shown in figs. 27, 28 and 29 magnetic strips system of generating electricity may be utilized. Magnetic strips (28) are mounted on the upper portion (9) of the pillar structure (8), on both the longitudinal sides of the plant, and the flapper pipe (14) of each flapper (13) is provided with magnetic strips (29) on its both ends in such a way that when flapper (13) moves after harnessing water energy of the water waves or water flow in a water body, the magnetic strips (29) also move over the magnetic strips (28), maintaining a desired gap, and electricity is produced in the known manner, due to the change in magnetic flux. The electricity produced is collected and transmitted in the known manner.<br>
For generating electricity the plant is provided in the water body. For the converting kinetic energy of water waves of a water body like sea, ocean, lake or pool the plant is provided in the water body which remains floating on the water surface and anchored at a place by using anchors like Ship anchors. If required it can be attached to the water base.<br>
The plant can be constructed in a desired length and which depending upon the capacity required. Wave generation study of various zones is available or can be carried out to design a plant. For better performance, length of the plant should be sufficient such that a large number of waves come across the flappers so that the chain always moves at a desired minimum speed to convert the water wave energy into electricity. The plant of this invention can be installed at any place near the sea shore or away from it. The plant is movable and can be shifted easily from one place to another. It remains floating on water<br>
15<br><br>
surface and automatically adjusted up and down with rise and fall of water level and as it allows water waves to move without resistance, it is not likely to be damaged by storms.<br>
For converting kinetic energy of water flow in a water body like river or canal where water flows continuously in a single direction, the plant is provided in a water body at a desired location and is fixed to some foundation. It does not obstruct the flow of water, but at the same time kinetic energy of the water flow is used for moving the flapper along with roller assemblies and chains and converting into electricity as described herein before. In this case flapper can be made without flapper valves as there will not be any reverse flow of water. The plant of this invention is preferably made of light weight corrosion proof material/metals or is provided with anti corrosive treatment/painting or coating.<br>
The above description with reference drawings is given just to understand the invention rather than to limit its scope.<br>
