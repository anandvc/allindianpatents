				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
NOVEL BENZOPHENONE DERIVATIVES OR SALTS THEREOF<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to novel<br>
benzophenone derivatives or the salts thereof that have<br>
anti-arthritic activities and inhibitory effect on bone<br>
destruction caused by arthritis and provide preventive,<br>
therapeutic and improving effect against arthritic<br>
diseases. Further, the invention relates to<br>
preventive/therapeutic agent for diseases, in which<br>
excessive expression of AP-1 is involved, and<br>
inhibitors against AP-1 activity, which contain the<br>
above benzophenone derivatives or the salts thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Arthritic disease such as connective tissue<br>
diseases, represented by rheumatoid arthritis, and<br>
osteoarthritis brings on joint dysfunction by the<br>
progression of cartilage/bone destruction and has a<br>
large effect on patients' daily life.<br>
Up until now, for drug treatment for<br>
rheumatoid arthritis and other arthritis, have been<br>
used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)<br>
such as aspirin and indomethacin, disease modifying<br>
antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) such as gold preparation<br>
and D~penicillamine, immunosuppressive drugs such as<br><br>
methotrexate, and adrenocorticoids. However, therapies<br>
currently in use cannot completely inhibit the progress<br>
of bone destruction, which is the most important<br>
problem of concern with arthritis, and are difficult to<br>
apply to patients for a long period of time because of<br>
adverse effects occurring in association with the drugs<br>
used and thereby satisfactory treatment has not been<br>
given to patients to date.<br>
To overcome the above problem, studies have<br>
been performed; for example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open<br>
No. 2000-336063 discloses benzophenone derivatives that<br>
are effective in the treatment for mouse collagen-<br>
induced arthritis. However, it is still expected that<br>
the benzophenone derivatives having anti-arthritic<br>
activities provide a further improvement in anti-<br>
arthritic activities and inhibitory effect on bone<br>
destruction caused by arthritis, safety, and<br>
pharmacokinetics.<br>
Further, it has been hoped that<br>
preventive/therapeutic agent for diseases, in which<br>
excessive expression of AP-1 is involved, are developed<br>
which provide inhibitory effect on the activity of<br>
transcription factor AP-1, suppress excessive<br>
expression of a variety of genes based on their<br>
inhibitory effect on AP-1, and produce less adverse<br>
effects.<br><br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Under these conditions, the inventors of this<br>
invention directed tremendous research effort toward<br>
coming up to the above expectation and hope, and they<br>
have found that benzophenone derivatives represented by<br>

substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group, R4 represents<br>
a substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyloxy group, an<br>
alkoxy group substituted with a substituted or<br>
unsubstituted phenyl or heterocyclic group, or a<br>
substituted or unsubstituted heterocyclic-oxy group,<br>
or the salts thereof have excellent anti-<br>
arthritic action as well as inhibitory action against<br>
bone destruction caused by arthritis, and moreover,<br>

have found that the compounds of this invention provide<br>
AP-1 inhibitory action and are useful as<br>
preventive/therapeutic agent for diseases, in which<br>
excessive expression of AP-1 is involved. And they<br>
have finally accomplished this invention.<br>

[Test Methods]<br>
Test Example 1 Effect on AP-1 binding activity to AP-1<br>
recognition sequence (ELISA)<br>
Jun peptide and Fos peptide with its N-<br>
terminal labeled with biotin via 4 glycine residues<br>
containing a DNA binding site [Nature, Vol. 373, 1995,<br>
257-261] were synthesized. Each of the peptides was<br>
dissolved in Tris buffer [20 mM Tris-hydrochloric acid<br>
(pH 7.5), 50 mM potassium chloride, 1 mM<br>
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 10 mM magnesium<br><br>
chloride, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 M<br>
guanidinohydrochloric acid, 30% glycerol], and<br>
equimolar amounts of the peptide solutions were mixed<br>
with each other to be used as an AP-1 complex (Fos/Jun<br>
peptide). The AP-1 complex was added onto a 96-well<br>
avidin-coated ELISA plate (10 pmol/well). The plate<br>
was washed, blocked by bovine serum albumin, and used<br>
for binding assay.<br>
Digoxigenin-labeled double-stranded<br>
oligonucleotide (22mer) that contained AP-1 binding<br>
sequence (3'-TGAGTCA-5') synthesized by conventional<br>
procedure was reacted in binding reaction solution [25<br>
mM tris-hydrochloric acid (pH 7.9), 0.5 mM<br>
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 0.05% Nonidet P-40,<br>
10% glycerol] for 30 minutes at room temperature in the<br>
presence or absence of samples. After the reaction,<br>
unbound labeled oligonucleotide was removed by washing<br>
with HEPES buffer containing 0.05% Tween-20. Then<br>
peroxidase-labeled anti-digoxigenin antibody was added<br>
to react with the labeled oligonucleotide bound to AP-1.<br>
After removing excess antibody by washing with HEPES<br>
buffer containing 0.05% Tween-20, incubation was<br>
conducted for a certain period with o-phenylene diamine<br>
as a substrate in 100 mM citric acid buffer (pH 5.0)<br>
containing hydrogen peroxide, sulfuric acid solution<br>
was added to each well, and the absorbance (492 nm) was<br>
measured. Inhibition rate of each sample was<br>
calculated from the absorbance obtained in the binding<br><br>
assay carried out in the presence of the sample, taking<br>
the absorbance obtained in the absence of the sample =<br>
100%.<br>
The results are shown in Table 12.<br><br><br><br>
mouse<br>
Male DBA/1J mice aged 8 weeks (Charles River<br>
Japan) were used. To a solution of 2 mg/mL bovine type<br>
II collagen in 0.1 mol/L acetic acid (Koken), an<br>
equimolar amount of Freund's complete adjuvant (DIFCO)<br>
was added to prepare an emulsion, and 0.2 ml of the<br>
emulsion was subcutaneously injected in the tail root<br>
region of each mouse. The same treatment was given 21<br>
days after the initial inoculation to induce arthritis<br>
in the mice. Test compounds were each suspended in<br>
0.5% methylcellulose solution, and 10 mg/kg of each<br>
test compound was given orally to mice once a day from<br>
21 to 35 days after the initial inoculation. To a<br>
control group (a negative control group), 0.5%<br>
methylcellulose solution was given in the same manner.<br>
Taking the maximum score as 12, the arthritis<br>
score was calculated to evaluate the severity of<br>
arthritis that was evaluated in the following manner:<br>
score 0: no change; score 1: swelling on one or two<br>
toes, or slight swelling in the carpal and tarsal<br>
joints; score 2: swelling and rubor in more joints;<br>
score 3: extensive swelling over whole foreleg or<br>
hindleg; and total of the four legs was calculated.<br>
X-ray photographs of four paws were taken 36<br>
days after the initial inoculation, and the severity of<br>
bone destruction was evaluated as bone destruction<br>
score on a maximum scale, the sum of the points for<br>
extremities, of 105 points: 0 or 0.5 points in<br><br>
accordance with presence or absence of osteoporosis in<br>
the joints and their vicinity, and for bone erosion, no<br>
change at 0 point; "partial bone destruction" at 1<br>
point and "complete bone destruction" at 2 points in<br>
the second to fifth interdigital joints, the first to<br>
fifth metacarpal and metatarsal joints, and carpal,<br>
tarsal and calcaneal regions. Inhibition rate was<br>
calculated using the following equation:<br>
Inhibition rate (%) = 100 - (score of the<br>
group given the test compound / score of the control<br>
group) x 100<br>

and the bone destruction inhibition rate of each test<br>
compound on 36 days after initial inoculation.<br><br><br>

methyl 4-(bromomethyl) benzoate, and 17.3 g of<br>
potassium carbonate were suspended in 400 mL of N,N-<br>
