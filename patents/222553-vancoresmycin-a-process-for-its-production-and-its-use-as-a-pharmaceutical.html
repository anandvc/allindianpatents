This invention relates to a compound named Vancoresmycin, which is obtainable by cultivation of the microorganism HIL-006734 (DSM 12216), and to its pharmaceutically acceptable salts and derivative?. The present invention further relates to a process for the production of Vancoresmycin, to the microorganism HIL-006734 (DSM 12216), to the use of Vancoresmycin and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts and derivatives as pharmaceuticals, in particular to their use as antibiotics, and to pharmaceutical compositions comprising Vancoresmycin or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or derivative thereof.<br>
Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections are known to be predominant in several infectious conditions like wounds and bums. Vancomycin and teicoplanin, belonging to the glycopeptide class, are the only two antibiotics clinically used for the treatment of MRSA infections. However, lue to the recent emergence of vancomycin- and teicoplanin-resistant strains, hese infections are reported to have become menacing and fatal. An htensive search for a structurally different class of compounds active against hese vancomycin and teicoplanin resistant strains has, therefore, been pitiated. For instance, methylsuifomycin I, a cyclic thiopeptide, has been escribed earlier [European Patent Publication No. 0818539 filed July 11, 1996] s an antibiotic active against vancomycin- and teicoplanin-resistant strains.<br>
has now been found that a novel compound named Vancoresmycin has ptibtotic activity. The present invention thus relates to Vancoresmycin, a impound of the fomnula:<br><br><br>
and to its pharmaceutically acceptable salts and derivatives, such as esters, ethers and obvious chemical equivalents, including all stereoisomeric forms and all tautomeric forms.<br>
Vancoresmycin has the molecular formula C71H126N2O21 (MW1343.80) and may be characterized by any one or more of its physico-chemical and spectral properties given below, such as its 1H NMR spectroscopic data and itsC NMR spectroscopic data, both provided in Table 2.<br>
Vancoresmycin may be described as a new antibiotic active against vancomycin and teicoplanin resistant strains. Vancoresmycin has a hitherto unreported new structure with a tetramic acid moiety bearing at the 3-position an acyl substituent with a highly oxygenated long alkyl chain substituted with an amino sugar. A chemical abstract literature search established Vancoresmycin to be a new compound. No other compound represented the structural features of Vancoresmycin.<br><br>
Vancoresmycin is obtainable by cultivation of a microorganism refen'ed to as culture no. HIL-006734 (henceforth referred to as HIL-006734). This microorganism used for the production of Vancoresmycin was isolated from a soil sample collected from National Park, Borivli, Mumbai, India. The microorganism HIL-006734 belongs to the order of Actinomycetales, genus Amycolatopsis, and has been deposited on 4 June 1998 with the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSM2 - Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH), Braunschweig, Germany and has been given the accession number DSM No. 12216.<br>
Thus, the present invention further provides a process for the production of the novel compound named Vancoresmycin from amycolatopsis species HIL-006734, its mutants and variants, under aerobic conditions in a nutrient medium containing one or more sources of carbon and one or more sources of nitrogen and optionally nutrient inorganic salts and/or trace elements, followed by isolation of the said compound and purification in a customary manner.<br>
Mutants and variants of the microorganism ST101170 may also be able to synthesize the compound according to the present invention. Such mutants may be produced in a known manner by physical means, for example irradiation such as with ultraviolet- or X-rays, or chemical mutagens, such as ethylmethylansulfonate (EMS), 2-hydroxy-4-methoxy-ben2ophenone (MOB) or N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG).<br>
The screening for suitable mutants and variants which can produce the compound according to the invention can be confirmed by detennination of the biological activity of the compounds accumulated in the culture broth, for example by testing the antibacterial action.<br>
The nutrient medium preferably contains sources of carbon, nitrogen and nutrient inorganic salts. The carbon sources are, for example, starch, glucose, sucrose, dextrin, fructose, molasses, glycerol, lactose or galactose, preferably starch. The sources of nitrogen are, for example, soyabean meal, peanut meal, yeast extract,<br><br>
beef extract, peptone, malt extract, corn steep liquor, gelatin or casamion acids, preferably peptone and yeast extract. The nutrient inorganic salts are, for example sodium hydrogen phosphate, potassium hydrogen phosphate, sodium chloride, calcium chloride, calcium carbonate, potassium nitrate, ammonium sulphate or magnesium sulphate, preferably calcium carbonate, sodium chloride and magnesium sulphate.<br>
The cultivation of HIL-006734 may be carried out at temperatures between 25-35°C and pH between 6.0 and 8.0. Preferably HIL-006734 is cultivated at 30°C (±1°C) and pH7.0.<br>
The cultivation of mL-006734 is preferably carried out for 60-96 hours when an optimal yield of the antibiotic of the invention is obtained. It is particularly preferred to carry out the cultivation by fermentation for 68-96 hours under submerged conditions for example in shake flasks as well as in laboratory fermenters. The progress of fermentation and formation of the Vancoresmycin can be detected by High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and by measuring the bioactivity of the culture broth against Staphylococci and Enterococci species by the known microbial agar plate diffusion assay method. The preferred culture is Staphylococcus aureus 3066, which is a resistant strain to methicillin, a p-lactam antibiotic reported in the literature and Entrococcus faecium ( E. faecium VR-1), which is resistant to vancomycin. In the resulting culture broth Vancoresmycin is present in the culture filtrate as well as in mycelium and can be isolated using known separation techniques. Thus, it can be recovered from the culture filtrate by extraction with a water immiscible solvent such as ethyl acetate, dichloromethane, chloroform or butanol at pH 5-8 or by hydrophobic interaction chromatography using polymeric resins such as "Diaion HP-20®" (Mitsubishi Chemical Industries Limited, Japan), "Amberiite XAD®" (Rohm and Hass Industries U.S.A.), activated charcoal or ion exchange chromatography at pH 5-8. The preferred method is extraction with ethyl acetate. The active material can also be recovered from mycelium by extraction with a water miscible solvent such as methanol, acetone, acetonitrile, n-propanol or iso-propanol or a water immiscible solvent such as ethyl acetate, dichloromethane, chlorofonn or butanol at pH 5-8 and the preferred method is<br><br>
the extraction with ethyl acetate. Concentration and lyophilization of the extracts gives the active crude material.<br>
The antibiotic Vancoresmycin of the present invention may, for example, be recovered from the crude material as follows :<br>
By fractionation using any of the following techniques: normal phase chromatography (using alumina or silica gel as stationary phase and eluents such as petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, methylene chloride, acetone, chloroform,' methanol or combinations thereof and additions of amines such as NEta), reverse phase chromatography (using reverse phase silica gel like<br>
dimethyloctadecylsilylsiiica gel, also called RP-18 or dimethyloctylsilyl silica gel also called RP-8 as stationary phase and eluents such as water, buffers viz. phosphate, acetate, citrate (pH 2-8) and organic solvents such as methanol, acetonitrile, acetone, tetrahydrofuran or combinations of these solvents), gel permeation chromatography using resins such as ®Sephadex LH-20 (Pharmacia Chemical Industries, Sweden), TSKgelToyopeari HW (TosoHaas, Tosoh Corporation, Japan) in solvents such as methanol, chloroform, acetone, ethyl acetate or their combinations or ®Sephadex G-10 and G-25 in water; or by counter-current chromatography using a biphasic eluent system made up of two or more solvents such as water, methanol, ethanol, Iso-propanol, n-propanol, tetrahydrofuran, acetone, acetonitrile, methylene chloride, chloroform, ethyl acetate, petroleum ether, benzene and toluene. These techniques may be used repeatedly or a combination of the different techniques may be used. The preferred method is chromatography over reverse phase silica gel (RP-18).<br>
The compound Vancoresmycin may be converted into pharmaceutically acceptable salts and derivatives, like esters and ethers and other obvious chemical equivalents, which are all covered by the present invention. The salts and derivatives can be prepared by standard procedures known to one skilled in the art. Salts like sodium and potassium salts, for example, may be prepared by treating Vancoresmycin with suitable sodium or potassium bases.<br><br>
Esters and ethers may be prepared by the methods given in the literature, for example, in Advanced Organic Synthesis, 4" Edition, J. March, John Wiley &amp; Sons., 1992.<br><br>
The amino group of the sugar moiety can be alkylated or acetylated e. g. with acid<br>
chlorides by standard procedures known to one skilled in the art.<br>
Chemical equivalents may be stable complexes with metal ions e.g. transition metals like La*, Sm*, Eu*, Gd*, which are typical for tetramic acid derivatives and may be prepared by the methods given in the literature (K.Tanaka et. al., Chem. Phamn. Bull. 1979, 27, 1901. K. Matsuo, Chem. Phann. Bull. 1980, 28. 2494).<br>
The double bonds of the alkyl side chain may be reduced by the methods given in the literature, for example in P. N. Rylander, "Hydrogenation Methods", Academic Press, New York (1985). Chpt. 2 or may be hydrohalogenated by methods described by H.O. House in "Modern Synthetic Reactions". W.A. Benjymin, Inc.. New York (1972), pp 446-452. Hydroxylated derivatives may be produced by reaction of the double bonds with reagents like OSO4 as described in the literature e.g. in Chem. Rev. 1980, 80, 187.<br>
Derivatives may also be fomied by conversion of the double bonds into epoxides by oxidation e.g. with MCPBA like described in Advanced Organic Synthesis, 4"* Edition. J. March. John Wiley &amp; Sons.. 1992.<br>
v'ancoresmycin has antibacterial activity. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of /ancoresmycin against a wide range of bacterial are given in Table 3 below, /ancoresmycin and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts and derivatives can be administered to animals, preferably to mammals, and in particular to humans as pharmaceuticals on their own, in mixtures with one another and in the form of pharmaceutical compositions which permit parenteral administration. Accordingly the present invention also relates to Vancoresmycin and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts and derivatives for use as pharmaceuticals and to the use of Vancoresmycin and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts and derivatives for the production of<br><br>
medicaments having antibacterial activity. The present invention further relates to phannaceutical compositions which contain an effective amount of Vancoresmycin and/or one or more phannaceuticaHy acceptable salts and/or derivatives thereof, together with a pharmaceuticaHy acceptable carrier.<br>
Vancoresmycin can be administered orally, intramuscularly, intravenously or by other modes of administration. Pharmaceutical compositions which contain Vancoresmycin or a phannaceutically acceptable salt or derivative thereof with other pharmaceutically active substances can be prepared by mixing the active compounds with one or more pharmacologically tolerated auxiliaries and/or excipients such as, for example, fillers, emulslfiers, lubricants, masking flavours, colorants or buffer substances, and converting the mixture into a suitable pharmaceutical form such as, for example, tablets, coated tablets, capsules, granules, powders, emulsions, suspensions or solutions suitable for parenteral administration.<br>
Examples of auxiliaries   and/or excipients which may be mentioned are tragacanth, lactose, talc, agar-agar, polyglycols, ethanol and water. Suitable and preferred for parenteral administration are suspensions or solutions In water. It is also possible to administer the active substances as such, without vehicles or diluents, in a suitable form, for example, in capsules.<br>
As is customary, the galenic formulation and the method of administration as well as the dosage range which are suitable in a specific case depend on the species to be treated and on the state of the respective condition or disease, and can be optimized using methods known in the art. On average, the daily dose of active compound in a patient of about 75kg weight is at least 0.001 mg to at most 10mg, preferably at most 10mg.<br>
The following are illustrative examples of the present invention but not limitative of the scope thereof:<br><br><br>
