				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of certain nucleoside analogues. In particular, the invention relates to a process that includes the reaction of formaldehyde, or a formaldehyde equivalent, with a cyclic amine and a heteroaromatic compound to give methylene linked cyclic amine deazapurines.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Nucleoside analogues that are potent inhibitors of purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) and purine phosphoribosyltransferases (PPRT) are useful in treating parasitic infections, T-cell malignancies, autoimmune diseases and inflammatory disorders {see e.g. V.L. Schramm, Biochimica et Biophysics Acta, 1587 (2002) 107-117}. The analogues are also useful for immunosupression in organ transplantation.<br>
Related nucleoside analogues that are potent inhibitors of 5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) and 5'-methylthioadenosine nucleosidase (MTAN) are useful:<br>
(a)	as anti-microbial compounds, and in decreasing the virulence of microbial infections by decreasing production of the quorum sensing pathway;<br>
(b)	as agents for treating parasitic infections such as malaria that infects red blood cells {see e.g. G.A. Kicska et al., J. Biol. Chem., 277 (2002) 3226-3231}; and<br>
(c)	as anti-tumour compounds, potentially in combination therapy with methotrexate or azaserine.<br>
The applicants have previously disclosed potent inhibitors of such enzymes in a class called the Immuciliins, based upon deazapurines covalently linked directly<br><br>
to aza-sugar moieties (US Patent Nos. 6,985,848 and 6,066,722, "Inhibitors of Nucleoside Metabolism"; and WO 02/19371, "Nucleoside Metabolism Inhibitors").<br>
In the search for new and improved nucleoside analogues that are potent inhibitors of the aforementioned nucleoside phosphorylases and nucleosidases, the applicants have also discovered a new class of compounds that are potent inhibitors of these nucleoside phosphorylases and hydrolases (PCT Patent Application PCT/NZ03/00186, "Inhibitors of Nucleoside Phosphorylases and Nucleosidases").<br>
The preparation of such nucleoside analogues is by way of multi-step chemical syntheses. Consequently, the time and cost required for each synthesis can be considerable. There is therefore a need for more efficient and cost effective methods of preparing compounds in this new class.<br>
The Mannich reaction is a condensation reaction between three components, namely an amine, formaldehyde and a compound with an active hydrogen atom such as a heteroaromatic compound e.g. indole (pages 812-814, Vogel's Textbook of Practical Organic Chemistry, 4th Edition, revised by B.S. Fumiss, A.J. Hannaford, V. Rogers, P.W.G. Smith and A.R. Tatchell, Longmans, London, 1978).<br>
Mannich reactions have been used to assemble compounds that incorporate a 9-deazapurine moiety linked via a methylene group to aliphatic and alicyclic amines [G.A. Modnikova et al., "Pyrrolo[3,2-d]pyrimidines. 111. 7-Aminomethyl-substituted pyrrolo[3,2-d]pyrimidines", Khim.-farm. Zh., 1983, 352-356 (English translation)]. Compounds that incorporate a pyrimidine moiety linked via a methylene group to a cyclic secondary amine have also been assembled using Mannich reactions. [V.V. Filichev and E.B. Pedersen, "Synthesis of 1-aza-C-nucleosides from (3R,4RH-(hydroxymethyl)pyrrolidin-3-or, Tetrahedron, 57 (2001) 9163-9168].<br>
The applicants have now found that a Mannich reaction can be used to prepare compounds that incorporate a 9-deazapurine or an 8-aza-9-deazapurine moiety (or their 2-aza-analogues) linked via a methylene group to a cyclic secondary<br><br>
amine. These compounds are described as potent inhibitors, or potentially potent inhibitors, of nucleoside phosphorylases and nucleosidases in PCT Patent Application PCT/NZ03/00186.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a process for preparing these compounds, or at least to provide a useful choice.<br>

(i) reacting a compound of formula (ill) as defined in claim 1 with a compound of formula (IV) as defined in claim 1 and with formaldehyde or a formaldehyde equivalent, where any one or more of V, W, X, Y and Z of the compound of formula (III) is protected with a suitable protecting group; and (ii) removing the one or more protecting groups to give the compound of formula (I).<br>

In still another embodiment, the invention provides a process of preparing a compound of formula (I) as defined in claim 1 including:<br>
(i) reacting a compound of formula (III) as defined in claim 1 with a compound of formula (IV) as defined in claim 1 and with formaldehyde or a formaldehyde equivalent, where any one or more of V, W, X, Y and Z of the compound of formula (III) is protected with a suitable protecting group and where any one or more of A, B, D and E of the compound of formula (IV) is protected with a suitable protecting group; and<br>
(ii) removing the one or more protecting groups to give the compound of formula (I).<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The present invention provides a useful synthetic route to compounds that are potential inhibitors of PNP, PPRT, MTAN, MTAP and/or nucleoside hydrolases (NH). Such compounds may find use in the treatment of parasitic infections, T-cell malignancies, autoimmune diseases and inflammatory disorders. These compounds may also be used as antimicrobial agents, as antitumour agents, or as agents for treating parasitic infections.<br>
Previous synthetic routes to compounds of formula (I) have been time-consuming and costly. In contrast, the present synthesis is a facile route to this useful class of compounds. The synthetic procedure involves using a Mannich reaction to couple a 9-deazapurine or an 8-aza-9-deazapurine moiety (or their 2-aza-analogues) to a cyclic secondary amine.<br>
The applicants have therefore found that the desired compounds of formula (I) are advantageously prepared in good yield in a one-step synthesis.<br>
It will be appreciated that the representation of a compound of formula (I), where B and/or D is a hydroxy group, is of the enol-type tautomeric form of a corresponding amide, and this will largely exist in the amide form. The use of the enol-type tautomeric representation is simply to allow fewer structural formulae to represent the compounds of the invention.<br>
Similarly, it will be appreciated that the representation of a compound of formula (I), where B and/or D is a thiol group, is of the thioenol-type tautomeric form of a corresponding thioamide, and this will largely exist in the thioamide form. The use of the thioenol-type tautomeric representation is simply to allow fewer structural formulae to represent the compounds of the invention.<br>
As used herein, the term "sulfonate leaving group" means an alkyl or aryl sulfonate such as.methanesurfonate or benzenesulfonate, or a substituted form thereof such as bromobenzenesulfonate, trifluoromethanesulfonate or p-toluenesulfonate.<br><br>
As used herein, the term "protecting group" means a group that selectively protects an organic functional group, temporarily masking the chemistry of that functional group' and allowing other sites in the molecule to be manipulated without affecting the functional group. Suitable protecting groups are known to those skilled in the art and are described, for example, in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis (3rd Ed.), T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, John Wiley &amp; Sons lnc(1999).<br>
Compounds of the formula (III) defined above may be prepared by known methods, as described in PCT Patent Application PCT/NZ03/00186 and the references cited therein. Procedures for the preparation of selected compounds of formula (ill) are described herein.<br>
Compounds of formula (IV) defined above may be prepared by known methods. In particular, processes for the preparation of the compounds 3H,5H-pyrrolo[3,2-d]pyrimidin-4-one (9-deazahypoxanthine) and 2-amino-3H,5H-pyrrolo[3,2-d]pyrimidin-4-one (9-deazaguanine), compounds 1 and 2 shown below, are described in PCT Patent Application PCT/NZ00/00048, "Process for Preparing Inhibitors of Nucleoside Metabolism and Substrates' and in R.H. Furneaux and P.C. Tyler, J. Org. Chem., 64 (1999) 8411-8412. Further, 9-deazaadenine (3) can be prepared by treatment of 9-deazahypoxanthine (1) with POCI3 and then with ethanolic ammonia. <br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br><br><br>
One advantage of the applicants' new process is that neither the amine nor the heterocyclic component needs to have protecting groups on the functional groups<br><br>
that are not directly involved in the reaction chemistry. Nevertheless, there may be occasions where it is advantageous to utilize a protected form of a compound of formula (III) and/or formula (IV) as components in the reaction.<br>
Suitably protected forms of compounds of formula (III) are described in US Patent Nos. 5,985,848 and 6,066,722, "Inhibitors of Nucleoside Metabolism" and WO 02/19371, "Nucleoside Metabolism Inhibitors". It is essential that suitably protected forms of compounds of the formula (IV) have a proton at poshion-9 of the 9-deazapurine or 8-aza-9-deazapurine moiety (or their 2-aza-analogues).<br>
Suitably protected forms of compounds of formula (IV) are described in PCT Patent Application PCT/NZ03/00186, "Inhibitors of Nucleoside Phosphorylases and Nucleosidases". It is essential that protected forms of compounds of the formula (III) have an unprotected ring amino-group.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The following examples further illustrate the invention. It is to be appreciated that the invention is not limited to the examples.<br>
Example 1: Mannich Reaction - General Procedure<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Scheme 1<br>
General procedure for the preparation of compounds of formula (3) using the Mannich reaction shown in Scheme 1; Pyrrolidine hydrochlorides of formula (1) (1.0 mol equiv.; as listed in Table 1 as "Amine reactanf unless otherwise specified) and sodium acetate (1.0 mol. equiv.) were dissolved in water<br><br>
and 1,4-dioxane (4:1 v/v, 2 mL per mmol) and to the solution were added aqueous formaldehyde (1.0 - 1.5 mol. equiv.) and the substituted 9-deazapurine of formula (2) (0.8 - 1.5 mol equiv.). The reaction was stirred at the temperature and for the time shown in Table 1. Silica gel (1.0 g per mmol of 1) was added and the mixture was evaporated to dryness. Purification by chromatography on silica gel, using gradient elution with CH2CI2: MeOH: NH4OH (95:5:1-»80:20:1 v/v/v) as the eluent, afforded the compound of formula (3) as detailed in Table 1 as the free base or partial acetic acid salt, which was converted to the HCI salt by addition and evaporation of excess cone. HGI [Evans, G.B.; Furneaux, R.H.; Tyler, P.C; Schramm, V.L Org. Lett. 2003, 5, 3639-3640.] The preparations of the pyrrolidine hydrochlorides of formula (1) are exemplified in the Preparative Examples.<br>
