				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates in general to a name service in a wireless ad hoc<br>
network and particularly to a distributed auto discovering name service for<br>
multihop wireless ad hoc networks.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
It is an increasing interest for developing and deploying wireless multihopadhoc<br>
networks in several different application areas within commercial, private<br>
installations, and for governmental purposes. The commercial applications of ad<br>
hoc networks can for instance be used for hot spot installations during special<br>
events. Hot spots are local areas where wireless access are provided for paying<br>
customers so they can be in contact with a network, such as the Internet or a<br>
private network. Private installations can be within a company or during a special<br>
event.<br>
The governmental applications can be during rescue operations within disaster<br>
areas, military applications, or during special events.<br>
A multihop wireless ad hoc network is built up by the nodes present since the<br>
network actually is formed by the present nodes; an ad hoc network does not have<br>
any central control function. The nodes all act as routers, routing traffic to other<br>
nodes which is a similar concept as for fixed networks. However, the routing<br>
protocol used in these types of multihop wireless ad hoc networks is often quite<br>
different from the normal routing protocols used for fixed networks. The nodes<br>
keep track of the other nodes by updating a routing table using the protocol and<br>
there are mainly two different categories of routing protocols: reactive and<br>
proactive. The reactive protocol reacts on the need of routing a message in the<br>
network and updates the routing table paths on demand. The proactive protocol<br>
updates the routing table on a regular basis.<br>
2<br><br>
The term multihop is defined as using the nodes together building up the network<br>
forwards messages and traffic not intended for themselves to other nodes able tocommunicate with the node until the data traffic reaches the intended node.<br>
The existing solutions for multihop wireless network has knowledge about which<br>
nodes are available and possible routing routes to the nodes part of the network;<br>
however, there is a lack of knowledge about the users in the multihop wireless<br>
network. The network infrastructure routing tables do not handle any naming<br>
services.<br>
Central domain name system (DNS) has a drawback in the fact that it is central,<br>
this means that it is vulnerable as a single point of failure. During update of such a<br>
central database, it may become unavailable for a certain period of time, thus<br>
making traffic within the network impossible or at least difficult.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
Accordingly the present invention according to a preferred embodiment preferably<br>
seeks to mitigate, alleviate or eliminate one or more of the above-mentioned<br>
disadvantages singly or in any combination.<br>
This is done by a method for automatic name service discovery, which is<br>
distributed to all nodes present in a network. A name service database is updated<br>
locally in each node present in the network.<br>
A first embodiment of the present invention, a method for associating user<br>
information with network information in a multihop wireless ad hoc network<br>
comprising a plurality of nodes is presented, comprising the steps of:<br>
receiving data indicative of changes of user information;<br>
updating a database stored in each node with entries associating the user<br>
information with network information;<br>
detecting in each node changes in the database; and<br>
distributing from each node data indicative of changes of the user information to<br>
nodes within radio range;<br>
3<br><br>
In the method, the user information may comprise information about at least one<br>
of user identifications, network addresses, available services within network, and<br>
authority level of each user.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention, a node in a multihop wireless ad hoc<br>
network comprising a plurality of nodes is presented, comprising<br>
a database for associating user information with network address; and<br>
a service for responding to changes of user information; the user information<br>
comprising at least one of users, network addresses, available services, and<br>
authority levels;<br>
wherein the service distributes the information changes to nodes within radio<br>
range.<br>
The service in the node may further update the information changes in the<br>
database.<br>
In yet another aspect of the present invention, a multihop wireless ad hoc network<br>
comprising a plurality of nodes, together forming the network, wherein changes of<br>
user information of the nodes are automatically distributed to all nodes within the<br>
network and wherein the user information is a naming service for associating user<br>
information with a respective network address.<br>
The user information may further comprise information about available services<br>
in nodes. The user information may further comprise information about authority<br>
level of each user.<br>
The at least one node within the network may be connected to a second network<br>
and wherein the at least one node acts as a gateway between the network and the<br>
second network; adapting user information in the network to usable information<br>
in the second network.<br>
In still another aspect of the present invention, an instruction set in a node in a<br>
multihop wireless ad hoc network comprising a plurality of nodes is presented, for<br>
4<br><br>
responding to changes of user information reaching the node, the instruction set<br>
comprising:<br>
an instruction set for detecting changes in a database, stored in each node,<br>
comprising association information between user information and network<br>
addresses;<br>
an instruction set for updating the database with changes of user information; the<br>
changes can be received from the node or other nodes; and<br>
an instruction set for distributing changes in the database to nodes within radio<br>
range.<br>
Yet another aspect of the present invention is presented: a database in a node in a<br>
multihop wireless ad hoc network, comprising entries for associating user<br>
information with network information; changes of the database being updated and<br>
distributed to all nodes within the network when changes in the database has been<br>
detected.<br>
In the database the entries may comprise at least one of user identification of each<br>
user connected within the network and corresponding network address, available<br>
services in each node, and authority level of each user.<br>
Yet another aspect of the present invention is presented: an application in a node<br>
in a multihop wireless ad hoc network using a database for finding a network<br>
address of a user within the network when communicating with a certain user; the<br>
database comprising entries for associating user information with network<br>
information; changes of the database being updated and distributed to all nodes<br>
within the network when changes in the database has been detected.<br>
Yet another aspect of the present invention comprise a database associating user<br>
information with network information for use when a mobile station in a packet<br>
based network system connects to a private network using a virtual private<br>
network function (VPN), wherein a VPN server contains one instance of the<br>
database for each connected user, and the instances of the database are<br>
automatically updated when changes of user information occur.<br>
5<br><br>

station in a packet based network system connects to a private network using a<br>
virtual private network function (VPN), wherein each mobile station contains one<br>
instance of the database, and each instance of the database are automatically<br>
updated when changes of user information occur.<br>
These and other aspects of the invention will be apparent from and elucidated<br>
with reference to the embodiments described hereinafter.<br>
Brief description of the drawings<br>
In the following the invention will be described in a non-limiting way and in more<br>
detail with reference to exemplary embodiments illustrated in the enclosed<br>
drawings, in which:<br>
Fig. l illustrates a network according to the present invention;<br>
Fig. 2 is a schematic of a node in the network found in Fig. l;<br>
Fig. 3 is a schematic of a method according to the present invention; and<br>
Fig. 4 is a schematic of another embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
Fig l illustrates a multihop wireless ad hoc network or cell 10 according to the<br>
present invention comprising, for example sake, a number of nodes l, 2, 3, 4, 5<br>
part of the network 10. The number of nodes that can be part of the network is not<br>
limited. The ad hoc network can in turn be connected to another network 12, fixed<br>
or wireless, for example the Internet, through one or several nodes acting as<br>
gateways. There is some type of routing protocol available for keeping a routing<br>
table with knowledge about the different nodes available and there network<br>
address information, as well as paths to gateways within the network.<br>
6<br><br>
In this example, node l with a user named X has the desire to communicate with a<br>
user named Y. In order to do this X needs to translate the user name, Y, to a<br>
network address. Thereafter, the routing protocol will be able to find user Y in the<br>
network. Finally communication is established between X and Y. The present<br>
invention uses a method for updating a database comprising information about<br>
available users and their network location (which is not the same as physical<br>
location of course); associating user information with network information. Each<br>
node continuously tracks traffic on the network in order to respond to changes in<br>
the network configuration. Each node may be looking in a neighbor cache<br>
available in each node, looking for neighbor topology changes. Such neighbor<br>
cache functions may be for example an ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)<br>
function in IPv4 or a Neighbor Discovery function in IPv6. These protocols keep<br>
track of network hardware addresses for neighboring nodes.<br>
Upon activation of the network, if a node discovers traffic on the network, it will<br>
exchange information to the nearest neighbors, the information may comprise,<br>
but not limited to, user information, address information, services available from<br>
the node, or authority level. The different types of information will be discussed<br>
later in more detail. The nearest neighbors obtain this information and store it in<br>
their local database located in each node. They will also pass the information on to<br>
their nearest neighbors and so on until equilibrium is reached and all nodes in the<br>
network have updated their database. Thus all nodes may have the same data<br>
about the network.<br>
When the network has formed, the nodes will still keep track of traffic and look for<br>
new users or new information available. If so, a new update stream will be sent to<br>
the nearest neighbors again and the network will be updated in the same manner<br>
as described above for the network activation situation.<br>
When a first node sees a new node it will ask the new node for information. There<br>
are two possible responses to this request:<br>
7<br><br>
	1.If the new node is using the method according to the present invention, the<br>
	two nodes will exchange information.<br>
	2. If the new node is not using the method according to the present invention,<br>
	no answer will come back to the first node, and the first node goes back to a<br>
	tracking mode: looking for new traffic in the network.<br>
A node may be triggered to send out new information to the network by using an<br>
internal trigger such as updating their own database with new information about<br>
themselves, thus the system will be triggered and start a network update<br>
transmission.<br>
Optionally it is possible to configure the system to flood the network with<br>
information in order to trigger a new update from the nearest neighbors or to<br>
update the entire network. This ensures that the network has fresh and correct<br>
information about users and available services. The flooding behavior may be<br>
triggered if there has been a long time period without any information exchange in<br>
the network or for the node, or it may be triggered on a regularly basis.<br>
When applications (or users) desire to communicate with a certain user, the node<br>
in question looks into the name service database and connects the user to a<br>
network address, enabling traffic to be routed within the network to the desired<br>
user.<br>
A more detailed description about different types of information that could be<br>
exchanged using the present invention will now follow. The two most important<br>
information types are user name and network address. These provide the<br>
possibility to find a route to a specific user. If a user logs out from a node and logs<br>
into another node the network updates the database entries accordingly and it will<br>
still be possible to route traffic to the correct user. The user information may<br>
comprise at least one of name, user name, identification data, email address, IP<br>
address in "Home" network, or other information relating to the user, such as<br>
home address, telephone number or similar data. With "Home" network means a<br>
network where the user belongs to such as, for instance, a private network or<br>
company network. This may be a network where the user often resides in with<br>
8<br><br>
user equipment but it may also be a network provided by a Service Provider (SP)<br>
granting access for the user and charging the user for these services.<br>
Other information that may be distributed is information about services provided<br>
by a modem, such as a VoIP gateway (Voice over IP), Internet gateway, fixed<br>
network services, infrastructure services, calculational services, database services,<br>
and other such informative services. Information about authority level of a user<br>
may be distributed using the present invention as well. This may be of interest for<br>
instance in a military application or in a rescue application, where it may be<br>
important to find a chain of command, a access level of databases available as<br>
services in the network, and so on.<br>
Advantages of the present invention include:<br>
	-No single point of failure, because all nodes have their own name service<br>
	database.<br>
	-Discovery of available nodes in the network is automatic.<br>
	-No central administration of the network is needed; each node may be<br>
	manually configured locally by the users.<br>
	-Data about all available nodes in the network is stored locally and may be<br>
	retrieved in one single operation (e.g. for use by applications).<br>
The invention may be implemented in software using many different coding<br>
approaches and run on a suitable calculational device, such as a microprocessor. It<br>
may also be implemented in more hardware close environments, such as in an<br>
FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array), a DSP (Digital Signal Processor), or an<br>
ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit). These are non-limiting examples of<br>
units or devices in which the present invention may be implemented.<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates a device 200 acting as a node in a multihop wireless ad hoc<br>
network. The device 200 may be a communicating device such as laptop, PDA<br>
(Personal Digital Assistant), PC (Personal Computer), mobile telephone (e.g.<br>
GPRS or 3G), or an application specific device for commercial, industrial, or<br>
governmental processes or purposes. The device may comprise a processing unit,<br>
9<br><br>
such as a microprocessor 201, controlling communication, calculations, and<br>
similar operations, a storage unit, such as a memory (volatile or non-volatile), a<br>
wireless interface unit 208 connected to an optional antenna 204, a<br>
communication interface 203 handling communication specific processes, and<br>
other units 205 to 207 for different processes, such as user interface, authorization<br>
interface, or display unit.<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates a method according to the present invention:<br>
	- receiving data indicative of changes of user information (301);<br>
	- updating a database with entries associating user information with network<br>
	information (302);<br>
	-detecting changes in the database (303); and<br>
	-distributing data indicative of changes of user information to nodes within<br>
	radio range (304).<br>
Fig. 4 illustrates a second embodiment of the present invention in which the<br>
present invention finds applicability on other networks apart from ad hoc<br>
networks, for instance in when a mobile station connects to a infrastructure based<br>
network, such as a WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network, e.g. hot spots or similar),<br>
a GPRS, or 3G network. For example, nodes 401 to 403 in a GPRS or 3G network<br>
are connected with an infrastructure 404 of the GPRS or 3G network. The<br>
infrastructure 404 is connected with for instance the Internet 405 and the user<br>
nodes establish a connection with a private network 408 through a VPN (Virtual<br>
Private Network) link using a VPN server 406. The VPN server stores instances of<br>
name service databases 407 each associated with the user connecting to the VPN<br>
network.<br>
Users may log into a VPN (Virtual Private Network) protected private network<br>
408 using their GPRS or 3G equipment. They log in to the VPN network via for<br>
instance the Internet or some similar public or semi public network (e.g. a<br>
network provided by a Service Provider). In order to keep track of the users from<br>
the private network and providing communication possibilities between users<br>
logged into the private network, a naming service according to the present<br>
10<br><br>
invention is utilized. When a user logs out, a new user logs in, or any other new<br>
information is available the name services in the private network are updated.<br>
Each user logged in has a dedicated name service database 407 associated with the<br>
user. This dedicated database 407 may be located in a server 406 associated with<br>
the private VPN protected network or locally cached (not shown) in each node,<br>
such as a PDA. A mobile station may be for instance a mobile phone, a laptop, a<br>
PDA, or similar equipment used in mobile applications.<br>
In this second embodiment the system is triggered for an update of information<br>
using a similar method as for the first embodiment.<br>
An interpretation interface or "translator" may be provided that can handle<br>
interfacing to applications that is not normally designed to communicate in a<br>
network using the present invention, i.e. a name resolution function for "legacy"<br>
applications.<br>
The name service database may communicate with an SNMP (Simple Network<br>
Management Protocol) application in order to collect statistical data,<br>
configurations, and so on, as well as being able to control and configure name<br>
service databases remotely from a central view point.<br>
A route export function implemented in a gateway may also be provided in order<br>
to communicate between the multihop wireless ad hoc network and other<br>
networks, such as a fixed network (e.g. Ethernet). This function acts as an<br>
interpreter between the name service available in the ad hoc network according to<br>
the present invention and standard routing and/or name service protocols<br>
available in other networks, such as OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) protocol.<br>
It should be noted that the word "comprising" does not exclude the presence of<br>
other elements or steps than those listed and the words "a" or "an" preceding an<br>
element do not exclude the presence of a plurality of such elements. It should<br>
further be noted that any reference signs do not limit the scope of the claims, that<br>
the invention may be implemented by means of both hardware and software, and<br>
that several "means" may be represented by the same item of hardware.<br>
11<br><br>
The above mentioned and described embodiments are only given as examples and<br>
should not be limiting to the present invention. Other solutions, uses, objectives,<br>
