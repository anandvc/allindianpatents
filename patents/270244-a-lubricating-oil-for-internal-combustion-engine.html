LUBRICANT COMPOSITION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a lubricant oil composition to be used in an<br>
internal combustion engine that uses a fuel originating from natural fat and oil.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
These days, environmental regulations are being increasingly tightened on a<br>
global scale, among which fuel efficiency regulations and exhaust emission regulations for<br>
automobiles are especially being further tightened. Demands for tightening of the<br>
regulations are derived from environmental issues such as global warming and resource<br>
conservation due to a concern for depletion of petroleum resources.<br>
Meanwhile, plants living on the earth absorb carbon dioxide in the air, water and<br>
sunlight to photosynthetically generate carbohydrate and oxygen. What is called, biofuel,<br>
which is manufactured from plant-based plant oil, has been gathering remarkable<br>
attentions because of its effects on reduction of carbon dioxide (a main cause of global<br>
warming) and reduction of atmospheric contaminants emitted from automobiles. In line<br>
with an idea of carbon neutral advocating that carbon dioxide generated due to combustion<br>
of plant biomass is not counted as a contributor to an increase of the global warming gas,<br>
ratio at which the biofuel is mixed in hydrocarbon fuel is expected to be increased in the<br>
future (cf. Non-Patent Document 1:).<br>
[0003]<br>
Non-Patent Document 1: Koji YAMANE, From Biodiesel Deep Fryer to Fuel<br>
Tank, (Tokyo-Tosho-Shuppankai, May of 2006)<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
[0004]<br><br>
An important problem in an internal combustion engine, especially in a diesel<br>
engine, has been how to reduce environment pollution caused by such emission gas<br>
components as particulate matters (PM such as soot) and NOx. An effective solution is to<br>
mount such an exhaust purifying device as a diesel particulate filter (DPF) or an exhaust<br>
purifying catalyst (oxidization or reduction catalyst) on an automobile. For example, soot<br>
generated in the diesel engine adheres to the DPF to be removed by oxidization and<br>
combustion.<br>
When the DPF is mounted on the diesel engine, post-injection of fuel is generally<br>
conducted so as to combust the soot accumulated on the filter. Engine oil is diluted by the<br>
fuel due to the post-injection, so that performance of the engine oil is expected to be<br>
deteriorated. Particularly, since biofuel can be easily accumulated in the engine oil due to<br>
its property and generates polar compounds when degraded and decomposed, the biofuel<br>
may adversely affect detergency of engine parts such as a piston. Such a defective<br>
phenomenon greatly depends on properties of lubricating oil used in the internal<br>
combustion engine.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a lubricating oil composition that<br>
is excellent in lubricity and engine-parts detergency even when biofuel or fuel mixed with<br>
the biofuel is employed in an internal combustion engine such as a diesel engine, and that<br>
imposes less adverse effects on the environment.<br>
MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS<br>
[0005]<br>
In order to solve the above-mentioned problems, according to an aspect of the<br>
present invention, lubricating oil compositions as follows are provided:<br>
(1)	a lubricating oil composition used in an internal combustion engine, the internal<br>
combustion engine using a fuel that contains at least one fat and oil selected from a group<br>
consisting of natural fat and oil, hydrotreated natural fat and oil, transesterified natural fat<br>
and oil and hydrotreated transesterified natural fat and oil, the lubricating oil composition<br>
containing: base oil of lubricating oil; a component (A) containing a boron derivative of a<br>
succinimide compound substituted by an alkyl or alkenyl group having a number average<br><br>
molecular weight of 200 to 5000; and a component (B) containing an alkaline earth<br>
metal-based detergent, in which the component (A) is contained by 0.01 to 0.2 mass% in<br>
terms of boron of a total amount of the composition while the component (B) is contained<br>
by 0.35 mass% or less in terms of the alkaline earth metal of the total amount of the<br>
composition. ;<br>
[0006]<br>
(2)	the above-described lubrication oil composition, in which a mass ratio (B/N) of<br>
boron (B) and nitrogen (N) contained in the component (A) is 0.5 or more;<br>
(3)	the above-described lubrication oil composition, in which a phenol-based<br>
antioxidant and/or an amine-based antioxidant are contained by 0.3 mass% or more of the<br>
total amount of the composition;<br>
(4)	the above-described lubrication oil composition, in which a sulfur content is 0.5<br>
mass% or less of the total amount of the composition;<br>
(5)	the above-described lubrication oil composition, in which a phosphorus content is<br>
0.12 mass% or less of the total amount of the composition; and<br>
(6)	the above-described lubrication oil composition, in which a sulfated ash content<br>
is 1.1 mass% or less.<br>
[0007]<br>
The lubricating oil composition according to the aspect of the present invention<br>
exhibits excellent detergency for engine parts such as a piston in the internal combustion<br>
engine using what is called biofuel made of natural fat and oil and the like even when the<br>
biofuel is mixed into the engine oil. Especially, the lubricating oil is excellent in<br>
high-temperature detergency when the engine reaches a high temperature. Even when used<br>
in a diesel engine with a DPF, the lubricating oil composition can reduce residual ash<br>
content on the DPF, thereby preventing performance of the DPF from being deteriorated.<br>
Natural fat and oil used in the present invention is not limited to plant-derived fat<br>
and oil but may include animal-derived fat and oil.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br><br>
[0008]<br>
An embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail below.<br>
A lubricating oil composition according to the present invention is used in an<br>
internal combustion engine, the internal combustion engine using a fuel that contains at<br>
least one fat and oil selected from a group consisting of natural fat and oil, hydrotreated<br>
natural fat and oil, transesterified natural fat and oil and hydrotreated transesterified<br>
natural fat and oil.<br>
[0009]<br>
Although the natural fat and oil may be a variety of animal-derived or<br>
plant-derived fat and oil that is generally available in nature, the natural fat and oil is<br>
preferably plant oil that contains ester of fatty acid and glycerin as a major ingredient,<br>
examples of which are safflower oil, soybean oil, canola oil, palm oil, palm kernel oil,<br>
cotton oil, cocoanut oil, rice bran oil, benne oil, castor oil, linseed oil, olive oil, wood oil,<br>
camellia oil, earthnut oil, kapok oil, cacao oil, haze wax, sunflower seed oil, corn oil and<br>
the like.<br>
The hydrotreated natural fat and oil is formed by hydrogenating the above fat and<br>
oil under the presence of a suitable hydrogenating catalyst.<br>
The hydrogenating catalyst is exemplified by a nickel-based catalyst, a platinum<br>
family (Pt, Pd, Rh, Ru) catalyst, a cobalt-based catalyst, a chrome-oxide based catalyst, a<br>
copper-based catalyst, an osmium-based catalyst, an iridium-based catalyst, a<br>
molybdenum-based catalyst and the like. A combination of two or more of the catalysts<br>
may also be preferably used as the hydrogenating catalyst.<br>
The transesterified natural fat and oil is ester formed by transesterifying<br>
triglyceride contained in the natural fat and oil under the presence of a suitable<br>
ester-synthesis catalyst. For instance, by transesterifying lower alcohol and the fat and oil<br>
under the presence of the ester-synthesis catalyst, fatty acid ester usable as biofuel is<br>
manufactured. The lower alcohol, which is used as an esterifying agent, is exemplified by<br>
alcohol having 5 or less carbon atoms such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol,<br>
pentanol and the like. In view of reactivity and cost, methanol is preferable. The lower<br><br>
alcohol is generally used in an amount equivalent to the fat and oil or more.<br>
The hydrotreated transesterified natural fat and oil is formed by hydrogenating<br>
the above transesterified fat and oil under the presence of a suitable hydrogenating<br>
catalyst.<br>
The natural fat and oil, the hydrotreated natural fat and oil, the transesterified<br>
natural fat and oil, and the hydrotreated transesterified natural fat and oil can be preferably<br>
used as mixed fuel by adding the above to fuel formed of hydrocarbon such as light oil.<br>
[0010]<br>
The lubricating base oil used in the lubricating oil composition according to the<br>
present invention is not particularly limited but may be suitably selected from any mineral<br>
oil and synthetic oil that have been conventionally used as base oil of the lubricating oil<br>
for the internal combustion engine.<br>
Examples of the mineral oil are mineral oil refined by processing lubricating oil<br>
fractions by at least one of solvent-deasphalting, solvent-extracting, hydrocracking,<br>
solvent-dewaxing, catalytic-dewaxing and hydrorefining (the lubricating oil fractions are<br>
obtained by vacuum-distilling atmospheric residual oil obtained by atmospherically<br>
distilling crude oil) and mineral oil manufactured by isomerizing wax and GTL WAX.<br>
On the other hand, examples of the synthetic oil are polybutene, polyolefin<br>
(α-olefin homopolymer or copolymer such as ethylene-α-olefin copolymer), various esters<br>
(such as polyol ester, diacid ester and phosphoric ester), various ethers (such as<br>
polyphenylether), polyglycol, alkylbenzene, alkyl naphthalene and the like. Among the<br>
above, polyolefin and polyol ester are particularly preferable.<br>
In the present invention, one of the above mineral oil may be singularly used or a<br>
combination of two or more thereof may be used as the base oil. In addition, one of the<br>
above synthetic oil may be singularly used or a combination of two or more thereof may<br>
be used. Further, a combination of at least one of the above mineral oil and at least one of<br>
the above synthetic oil may be used.<br>
[0011]<br>
Although viscosity of the base oil subjects to no specific limitation and varies<br><br>
depending on usage of the lubricating oil composition, kinematic viscosity thereof at 100<br>
degrees C is generally preferably 2 to 30 mm /s, more preferably 3 to 15 mm /s, much<br>
more preferably 4 to 10 mm /s. When the kinematic viscosity at 100 degrees C is 2 mm /s<br>
or more, evaporation loss is small. When the kinematic viscosity at 100 degrees C is 30<br>
mm2/s or less, power loss due to viscosity resistance is restricted, thereby improving fuel<br>
efficiency.<br>
[0012]<br>
As the base oil, oil whose %CA measured by a ring analysis is 3 or less and<br>
whose sulfur content is 50 ppm by mass or less can be preferably used. The %CA<br>
measured by the ring analysis means a proportion (percentage) of aromatic content<br>
calculated by the n-d-M method (a ring analysis). The sulfur content is measured based on<br>
Japanese Industrial Standard (hereinafter called, JIS) K 2541.<br>
The base oil whose %CA is 3 or less and whose sulfur content is 50 ppm by mass<br>
or less exhibits a favorable oxidation stability. Such base oil can restrict an increase of acid<br>
number and a generation of sludge, thereby providing a lubricating oil composition that is<br>
less corrosive to metal. The sulfur content is more preferably 30 ppm by mass or less.<br>
The %CA is more preferably 1 or less, much more preferably 0.5 or less.<br>
In addition, viscosity index of the base oil is preferably 70 or more, more<br>
preferably 100 or more, much more preferably 120 or more. In the base oil whose<br>
viscosity index is 70 or more, a viscosity change due to a temperature change is small.<br>
[0013]<br>
The component (A) of the lubricating oil composition according to the present<br>
invention is a boron derivative of a succinimide compound substituted by an alkyl or<br>
alkenyl group having a number average molecular weight of 200 to 5000.<br>
Such a boron derivative of the succinimide compound can be obtained by<br>
exemplarily reacting (a) a succinic acid substituted by an alkyl or alkenyl group having the<br>
number average molecular weight of 200 to 5000 or an anhydride of the succinic acid, (b)<br>
polyalkylene polyamine and (c) a boron compound.<br>
Materials (a), (b) and (c) and synthetic methods therefor will be described below.<br><br>
As the material (a), the succinic acid substituted by the alkyl or alkenyl group or<br>
an anhydride of the succinic acid is used. The number average molecular weight<br>
(hereinafter may be abbreviated as molecular weight or Mn) of the alkyl or alkenyl group<br>
is typically 200 to 5000, preferably 500 to 2000. When the molecular weight of the alkyl<br>
or alkenyl group is less than 200, the eventually-obtained boron derivative of the<br>
succinimide compound may not be sufficiently dissolved in the base oil of the lubricating<br>
oil. When the molecular weight is more than 5000, the succinimide compound may<br>
become so highly viscous as to impair the usability.<br>
[0014]<br>
As the alkyl or alkenyl group having such a molecular weight, a polymer or a<br>
copolymer of monoolefin and diolefin having 2 to 16 carbon atoms or a hydride of the<br>
polymer or the copolymer is typically used. Examples of monoolefin are ethylene,<br>
propylene, butene, butadiene, decene, dodecene, hexadecene and the like. Among the<br>
above-listed monoolefin, butene is particularly preferable in the present invention because<br>
of its enhanced high-temperature detergency for the engine parts and its availability. A<br>
polybutenyl group (a polymer of the butene) and a hydrogenated polybutenyl group (an<br>
alkyl group obtained by hydrogenating the polybutenyl group) are more preferable.<br>
[0015]<br>
The alkyl or alkenyl substituted succinic acid or an anhydride of the succinic acid<br>
as the material (a) may be obtained by reacting a substance such as polybutene having the<br>
molecular weight equivalent to that of the alkyl or alkenyl group with a substance such as<br>
maleic anhydride by a conventional method.<br>
[0016]<br>
Although polyalkylene polyamine is used for the material (b), 5 mol% or more of<br>
the total material is preferably formed from polyalkylene polyamine having a terminal<br>
ring structure. The entirety of the material (b) may be formed from polyalkylene<br>
polyamine having a terminal ring structure, or the material may be a mixture of<br>
polyalkylene polyamine having a terminal ring structure and polyalkylene polyamine<br>
having no terminal ring structure. When polyalkylene polyamine having a terminal ring<br><br>
structure is contained by 5 mol% or more, engine-parts detergency is further improved,<br>
which is an object of the present invention. When the content of the polyalkylene<br>
polyamine is 10 mol% or more, further 20 mol% or more, the detergency is further<br>
improved, especially detergency at a high temperature is enhanced.<br>
In the present invention, the upper limit on the content of polyalkylene polyamine<br>
having a terminal ring structure is preferably 95 mol% or less, more preferably 90 mol%<br>
or less. When the content exceeds 95 mol%, the manufactured boronated succinimide<br>
compound may become so highly viscous as to impair manufacturing efficiency of the<br>
compound and solubility of the product in the base oil of the lubricating oil may be<br>
deteriorated. Accordingly, the content of polyalkylene polyamine having a terminal ring<br>
structure is preferably 5 to 95 mol%, more preferably 10 to 90 mol%.<br>
The terminal ring structure of polyalkylene polyamine having a terminal ring<br>
structure is preferably represented by a formula (1) as follows.<br>
[0017]<br><br>
In the formula (1), p and q each represent an integer in a range of 2 to 4.<br>
Particularly, a group where both p and q are 2, i.e., piperazinyl group is preferable. A<br>
representative example of polyalkylene polyamine having a terminal ring structure is<br>
aminoalkyl piperazine having a terminal piperazinyl structure such as aminoethyl<br>
piperazine, aminopropyl piperazine, aminobutyl piperazine, amino(diethylenediamino)<br>
piperazine, amino(dipropyldiamino) piperazine and the like. Among the above,<br>
aminoethyl piperazine is particularly preferable in view of its availability.<br>
[0018]<br>
On the other hand, polyalkylene polyamine having no terminal ring structure<br>
means polyalkylene polyamine having no ring structure or polyalkylene polyamine having<br>
a non-terminal ring structure. Representative examples of polyalkylene polyamine having<br><br>
no ring structure are polyethylene polyamines such as ethylenediamine,<br>
diethylenetriamine,	triethylenetetramine,	tetraethylenepentamine	and<br>
pentaethylenehexamine, propylenediamine, dibutylenetriamine, tributylenetriamine and<br>
the like. A representative example of polyalkylene polyamine having non-terminal ring<br>
structure is di(aminoalkyl) piperazine such as di(aminoethyl) piperazine.<br>
[0019]<br>
A mixture of polyalkylene polyamine and polyethylene polyamine such as<br>
triethylenetetramine, tetraethylenepentamine and pentaethylenehexamine among the above<br>
listed polyalkylene polyamine that may have a ring structure is particularly preferable<br>
because of its enhanced high-temperature detergency for engine-parts and its availability.<br>
[0020]<br>
As the material (c), a boron compound is used. Examples of the boron compound<br>
are boracic acid, boric anhydride, borate ester, boric oxide and boron halogenide. Among<br>
the above, boracic acid is particularly preferable.<br>
[0021]<br>
The component (A) according to the present invention can be obtained by<br>
reacting the materials (a), (b) and (c). Without special limitations, any known methods of<br>
reacting can be used. For instance, by reacting the materials by the following manner, the<br>
target substance can be obtained. The materials (a) and (b) are initially reacted with each<br>
other, then its reaction product is reacted with the material (c). A mixing ratio of the<br>
materials (a) to (b) in the reaction of the material (a) and (b) is preferably 0.1-to-10 to 1<br>
(mole ratio), more preferably 0.5-to-2 to 1 (mole ratio). A reaction temperature of the<br>
materials (a) and (b) is preferably in a range of approximately 80 to 250 degrees C, more<br>
preferably in a range of approximately 100 to 200 degrees C. At the time of reacting,<br>
depending on the materials, or in order to adjust the reaction, solvents such as an organic<br>
solvent exemplified by hydrocarbon oil may be used as necessary.<br>
[0022]<br>
Subsequently, the thus-obtained reaction product of the materials (a) and (b) is<br>
reacted with the material (c). A mixing ratio of polyalkylene polyamine to the boron<br><br>
compound as the reaction material (c) is typically 1 to 0.05-to-10, preferably 1 to 0.5-to-5<br>
(mole ratio). A reaction temperature therefor is typically approximately 50 to 250 degrees<br>
C, preferably 100 to 200 degrees C. At the time of reacting, as in the reaction of the<br>
materials (a) and (b), depending on the materials or in order to adjust the reaction, solvents<br>
such as an organic solvent exemplified by hydrocarbon oil may be used as necessary.<br>
As a product of the above reaction, a boron derivative of a succinimide<br>
compound substituted by an alkyl or alkenyl group having a number average molecular<br>
weight of 200 to 5000 (the (A) component) is obtained. In the present invention, one of<br>
the component (A) may be singularly used or a combination of two or more thereof may<br>
be used.<br>
[0023]<br>
The content of the component (A) in the lubricating oil composition according to<br>
the present invention is 0.01 to 0.2 mass% in terms of boron (atoms) of the total amount of<br>
the composition, preferably 0.01 to 0.15 mass%, more preferably 0.01 to 0.1 mass%.<br>
Since a predetermined amount or more of boron is contained in the component (A), even<br>
when biofuel is mixed into the lubricating oil composition, pistons can be favorably<br>
cleaned in the high-temperature internal combustion engine. When the content of boron is<br>
less than 0.01 mass%, sufficient high-temperature detergency is not obtained. When the<br>
content of boron exceeds 0.2 mass%, no further improvement is made on the<br>
high-temperature detergency, which is of little practical use.<br>
A mass ratio (B/N) of boron (B) and nitrogen (N) contained in the component (A)<br>
is preferably 0.5 or more, more preferably 0.6 or more, much more preferably 0.8 or more.<br>
When B/N is 0.5 or more, high-temperature detergency for engine parts is greatly<br>
enhanced.<br>
Although a boronated succinimide-based compound can be obtained by initially<br>
reacting the materials (a) and (b) and subsequently reacting the reaction product thereof<br>
with the material (c), the reaction order may be changed such that the materials (a) and (c)<br>
are initially reacted and the reaction product thereof is subsequently reacted with the<br>
material (b). With this reaction order, the target boronated succinimide compound may<br><br>
also be likewise obtained.<br>
[0024]<br>
The component (B) of the lubricating oil composition according to the present<br>
invention is an alkaline earth metal-based detergent. For example, one selected from a<br>
group consisting of alkaline earth metal sulfonate, alkaline earth metal phenate and<br>
alkaline earth metal salicylate and a mixture of two or more selected from the group may<br>
be preferably used.<br>
An example of alkaline earth metal sulfonate is alkaline earth metal salt of alkyl<br>
aromatic sulfonic acid obtained by sulfonating an alkyl aromatic compound having a<br>
molecular weight of 300 to 1500 (preferably 400 to 700). The alkaline earth metal salt is<br>
exemplified by magnesium salt and/or calcium salt and the like, among which calcium salt<br>
is preferably used.<br>
An example of alkaline earth metal phenate is alkaline earth metal salt of<br>
alkylphenol, alkylphenol sulfide and a Mannich reaction product of alkylphenol. The<br>
alkaline earth metal salt is exemplified by magnesium salt and/or calcium salt and the like,<br>
among which calcium salt is preferably used.<br>
An example of alkaline earth metal salicylate is alkaline earth metal salt of alkyl<br>
salicylic acid. The alkaline earth metal salt is exemplified by magnesium salt and/or<br>

[0025]<br>
In addition, alkaline earth metal sulfonate, alkaline earth metal phenate and<br>
alkaline earth metal salicylate may be neutral alkaline earth metal sulfonate, neutral<br>
alkaline earth metal phenate and neutral alkaline earth metal salicylate obtained by:<br>
directly reacting the above-described alkyl aromatic sulfonic acid, alkylphenol,<br><br>
alkylphenol sulfide, a Mannich reaction product of alkylphenol, alkyl salicylic acid or the<br>
like with alkaline earth metal base exemplified by an oxide or a hydroxide of alkaline<br>
earth metal such as magnesium and/or calcium; or converting the above-described<br>
substance into alkali metal salt such as sodium salt or potassium salt and subsequently<br>
substituting the alkali metal salt with alkaline earth metal salt. Alternatively, alkaline earth<br>
metal sulfonate, alkaline earth metal phenate and alkaline earth metal salicylate may be:<br>

[0026]<br>
In the present invention, the content of the alkaline earth metal-based detergent is<br>
0.35 mass% or less in terms of alkyl earth metal, preferably 0.01 to 0.35 mass%, more<br>
preferably 0.1 to 0.35 mass%. When the content of the alkaline earth metal-based<br>
detergent is 0.01 mass% or more, the lubricating oil composition exhibits more excellent<br>
oxidation stability, base-number retention and high-temperature detergency. On the other<br>
hand, when the content of the alkaline earth metal-based detergent exceeds 0.35 mass%,<br>
performance of catalyst for purifying exhaust gas may be deteriorated. In addition, when<br>
such a detergent is used in a diesel engine with a DPF, an amount of ash content adhering<br>
to the DPF may be increased, thereby shorting the life of the DPF.<br>
[0027]<br>

esters (such as Mo-DTP), thiophosphonate esters and amino salts or metal salts thereof.<br><br>
[0033]<br>
As the ashless-type friction modifier, any compounds generally used as the<br>
ashless-type friction modifier for lubricating oil may be used, examples of which are fatty<br>
acid, aliphatic alcohol, aliphatic ether, aliphatic ester, aliphatic amine and aliphatic amide<br>
that have at least one alkyl or alkenyl group of 6 to 30 carbon atoms in the molecule.<br>
[0034]<br>

In view of blending effects, a content of the rust inhibitor is typically 0.01 to 1 mass% of<br>
the total amount of the composition, preferably 0.05 to 0.5 mass%.<br>
[0035]<br>
Examples of the metal deactivator (copper corrosion inhibitor) are<br>
benzotriazole-based compounds, tolyltriazole-based compounds, thiadiazole-based<br>
compounds and imidazole-based compounds. Among the above, the benzotriazole-based<br>
compounds are preferable. By adding the metal deactivator, the engine parts can be<br>
prevented from being metallically corroded and degraded due to oxidation. In view of<br>
blending effects, a content of the metal deactivator is preferably 0.01 to 0.1 mass% of the<br>
total amount of the composition, more preferably 0.03 to 0.05 mass%.<br>
[0036]<br>
Examples of the surfactant are nonionic surfactants based on polyalkylene glycol<br>

[0037]<br>
Examples of the antifoaming agent are silicone oil, fluorosilicone oil,<br>

economics, a content of the antifoaming agent is preferably approximately 0.005 to 0.1<br>
mass% of the total amount of the compound.<br>
[0038]<br>
Sulfur content of the lubricating oil composition according to the present<br><br>
invention is preferably 0.5 mass% or less of the total amount of the composition, more<br>
preferably 0.3 mass% or less, much more preferably 0.2 mass% or less. When the sulfur<br>
content is 0.5 mass% or less, deterioration of the catalyst performance for purifying<br>
exhaust gas can be effectively prevented.<br>
Phosphorus content of the lubricating oil composition according to the present<br>
invention is preferably 0.12 mass% or less of the total amount of the composition, more<br>
preferably 0.1 mass% or less. When the phosphorus content is 0.12 mass% or less,<br>
deterioration of the catalyst performance for purifying exhaust gas can be effectively<br>
prevented.<br>
Sulfated ash content of the lubricating oil composition according to the present<br>
invention is preferably 1.1 mass% or less, more preferably 1 mass% or less. When the<br>
sulfated ash content is 1.1 mass% or less, deterioration of the catalyst performance for<br>
purifying exhaust gas can be effectively prevented. In addition, in a case of a diesel engine,<br>
the ash content accumulated on the filter of the DPF can be reduced, thereby preventing<br>
the filter blockage due to the ash content and contributing to a long life of the DPF. The<br>
sulfated ash content means ash content obtained by adding sulfuric acid carbonized<br>
residue caused by combustion of samples for heating so that the residue has a constant<br>
mass. The sulfated ash is generally used to know a rough amount of metal-based additives<br>
contained in the lubricating oil composition. Specifically, the sulfated ash is measured by a<br>
method prescribed in "5. Experiment Method of Sulfated Ash" of JIS K 2272.<br>
[0039]<br>
Since the lubricating oil composition according to the present invention contains<br>
the predetermined amounts of the components (A) and (B), even when used in the internal<br>
combustion engine that consumes biofuel, the lubricating oil composition exhibits<br>
excellent detergency for the engine parts such as pistons. In addition, when the lubricating<br>
oil composition is combusted, exhaust gas produced by the combustion contains less ash<br>
content. Accordingly, the lubricating oil composition is favorably applicable especially to<br>
a diesel engine with DPF.<br>

[0045]<br>
Measurement of properties of the lubricating oil compositions and the hot tube<br>
test were conducted in the following manner.<br>
(Calcium Content)<br>
Measurement was conducted based on JIS-5S-38-92.<br>
(Boron Content)<br>
Measurement was conducted based on JIS-5S-38-92.<br>
(Nitrogen Content)<br>
Measurement was conducted based on JIS K2609.<br>
(Phosphorus Content)<br>
Measurement was conducted based on JPI-5S-38-92.<br><br>
(Sulfur Content)<br>
Measurement was conducted based on JIS K2541.<br>
(Sulfated Ash Content)<br>
Measurement was conducted based on JIS K2272.<br>
[0046]<br>
(Hot Tube Test)<br>
As the lubricating oil composition to be tested, mixed oil in which biofuel (fuel<br>
obtained by transesterifying canola oil with methyl alcohol) was mixed by 5 mass% of<br>
each of the lubricating oil compositions (new oil) was used, assuming a mixing ratio of the<br>
fuel and the lubricating oil in an internal combustion engine. The measurement was<br>
conducted with the test temperature being set at 280 degrees C and other conditions being<br>
based on JPI-5S-55-99. For reference, the same test was also conducted using only new oil.<br>
In addition, since the hot tube test may be affected by the amount of the viscosity index<br>
improver, the mixing amount of the viscosity index improver was made constant among<br>
Examples and Comparatives. The smaller an amount of fouling on the glass tube after the<br>
test was, the more favorable the detergency is.<br>
The properties of the lubricating oil compositions and the results of the hot tube<br>
test are shown in Tables 1 and 2.<br>
[0047]<br>
[Table 1]<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
[0049]<br>
[Evaluation Result]<br>
As is understood from the results of the hot tube test shown in Tables 1 and 2,<br>
Examples 1 to 9, where the lubricating oil composition according to the present invention<br>
was used, produced almost as small an amount of fouling as the new oil (i.e., a lubricating<br>
oil composition to which no biofuel was added), irrespective of the addition of the biofuel.<br>
In contrast, Comparatives 1 and 2, where the component (A) according to the present<br>
invention was not contained, produced a much larger amount of fouling than the new oil,<br>
thereby exhibiting inferior detergency for the engine. In addition, Comparative 3, where<br>
the component (B) according to the present invention was not contained, produced a much<br>
larger amount of fouling than the new oil as did Comparatives 1 and 2, thereby exhibiting<br>
inferior detergency for the engine.<br>
