				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical<br>
preparation for the treatment of leucoderma.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Leucoderma or vitiligo is a disease commonly associated with<br>
failure of pigmentation of the skin. Para-aminobenzoic acid,<br>
panthothenic acid and biotin are alleged to function in the<br>
process dealing with pigmentation of the skin. It is true that<br>
gray-haired condition has been produced in rats, dogs, guinea-<br>
pigs and silver faxes on certain types of deficient diets: but it<br>
seems a far cry from this experimental procedure to the process<br>
of aging as it occurs in human being. An enzyme tyrosinase<br>
converts Tyrosine into melanin, a brownish black pigment present<br>
in skin and hair. The mechanism by which this transformation is<br>
accomplished is not known. According to Raper, a hydroxy lotion<br>
of benzene nucleus possibly takes place, followed by ring closure<br>
whereby indole derivatives are formed.<br>
Para-aminobenzDic acid modifies the formation of melanin. In the<br>
Tyrosine-tyrosinase reaction, a typical red stage 1 is reached<br>
before the black precipitate of melanin is obtained. In the<br>
presence of the acid, the red stage is not seen and in the place<br>
of the black melanin precipitate, a brownish product is obtained.<br>
It has also been claimed that melanophore hormone of the<br>
pituitary accelerates the tyrosine-tyrosinase reaction. There are<br>
different degrees and forms of the disease and the cure mainly<br>
depends on the extent of manifestation. This is due to the<br>
shortage or complete absence of tyrosinase in the system. Several<br>
ayurvedic preparations are known to be prescribed for vitiligo<br>
such as a composition comprising Psoralia Coryfolia, commonly<br>
known as buchkidana and Pavonia Odorata, commonly known as<br>
udicha. Another commonly prescribed composition is a mixture of<br>
Plumbago Rosea Linn. (Raktachita) and Mussaenda frondosa Lin<br>
(Nagballi). However, presently no cure is known for the disease,<br>
particularly in its advanced stages.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of this invention to propose a<br>
pharmaceutical preparation for the treatment of leucoderma.<br>
It is a further object of this invention to propose a pharmaceutical<br>
preparation for the treatment of leucoderma which is cheap<br>
and can be made easily available.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a pharmaceutical<br>
preparation for the treatment of leucoderma which is efficient<br>
even for advanced stages of the disease.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to this invention, there is provided a pharmaceutical<br>
preparation for the treatment of leucoderma comprising tyrosine,<br>
a diluent and optionally methionine and an inorganic salt of<br>
zinc .<br>
According to this invention, there is further provided a process<br>
for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for the<br>
treatment of leucoderma comprising mixing tyrosinase with a<br>
diluent to obtain a first mixture,<br>
mixing the first mixture with a zinc salt and optional additives<br>
to obtain the pharmaceutical composition,<br>
optionally preparing a second mixture of methionine and the<br>
diluent and adding the second mixture to the first mixture,<br>
before adding the zinc salt thereto.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparation is in the form of an oral formu-<br>
lation or a topical formulation.<br>
The topical formulation comprises tyrosine and a diluent in a<br>
carreir such as water.<br>
About 1 to 3 gms of the mixture of tyrosine and the diluent is<br>
dissolved in about 45 to 135 ml distilled water and 5 to 15 ml of<br>
a preservative such as 90% rectified spirit is added to it to<br>
obtain the topical formulation.<br>
The oral formulation comprises tyrosine, methionine, diluent and<br>
an inorganic salt of zinc.<br>
In accordance with this invention, the oral formulation is<br>
prepared by thoroughly mixing tyrosine with a diluent and slowly<br>
increasing the proportion of the diluent to obtain a mixture of<br>
tyrosine and the diluent. Thereafter, methionine is mixed with<br>
the diluent and the dilution is slowly increased by increasing<br>
the proportion of sugar to obtain a mixture of methionine and the<br>
diluent. The two mixtures are then mixed thorouqly and zinc<br>
sulphate is added to it, followed by a further mixing.<br>
Thereafter, optional additives are added to the mixture obtained<br>
to obtain the oral formulation.<br>
About 5 to 9 gms of the mixture of tyrosine and the diluent is<br>
mixed with 1 to 5 gms of methionine mixture and about 1 gm of the<br>
inorganic salt of zinc is mixed together to obtain the oral<br>
formulation. The inorganic salt of zinc, is any salt of zinc,<br>
preferably a sulphate.<br>
The diluent used is a sugar such as lactose, fructose, sucrose,<br>
glucose, etc., preferably lactose.<br>
The binder is a compound such as carboxymethyl cellulose; the<br>
disintegrant used is starch 5 the glidant used is such as aerosil;<br>
magnesium stearate. The lubricant used is a compound such as<br>
talcum powder and the preservative is a paraben compound such as<br>
methyl paraben, propyl paraben, etc..<br>
The carrier used for the topical formulation is a solvent such as<br>
water.<br>
The invention will now be explained in greater detail with the<br>
help of the following non-limiting examples.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
About 1 gm of tyrosine is thoroughly mixed with about 9 gms of<br>
lactose (80-100 mesh) placed in a mortar and the mixture is<br>
macerated for 60 mins.. Every 5 mins. of maceration is followed<br>
by mixing for 1 min.. This process is repeated 10 times. The<br>
mixture is transferred in a bigger mortar and fresh lactose of 90<br>
gms is mixed with it for about 10 mins.. It is again macerated<br>
for 5 mins. and mixed for a minute. This process is repeated 10<br>
times. Fresh lactose, 900 gms is taken in a big mortar and the<br>
mixture obtained earlier is poured over it, followed by thorough<br>
mixing for about 10 mins.. This is again followed by maceration<br>
for 5 mins. and mixing for a min., 10 times to obtain the<br>
tyrosine mixture of 1000 dilution.<br>
In a similar way, about 300 mg of methionine is mixed with 2.7<br>
gms of lactose for about 5 mins.. This is followed by maceration<br>
for 5 mins. and mixing for a min., 10 times to obtain a mixture.<br>
In another mortar, about 27 gms lactose is taken and the mixture<br>
is poured over it and mixed thoroughly. It is macerated for 5<br>
mins. and mixed for a min., 10 times to obtain a mixture, which<br>
is again mixed with about 270 gms of lactose. This is again<br>
followed by maceration for 5 mins. and mixing for 1 min., 10<br>
times to obtain the methionine mixture of 1000 dilution.<br>
TOPICAL FORMULATION.<br>
About 2 gms of the tyrosine mixture is dissolved in about 90 ml<br>
distilled water and to this solution, about 10 ml 90V. rectified<br>
spirit is added and the mixture is shaken to obtain the topical<br>
formulation.<br>
ORAL FORMULATION<br>
About 7 gms of tyrosine mixture and 3 gms of methionine are mixed<br>
thoroughly for about 20 mins. and 100 mgs or 0.1 gms zinc<br>
sulphate, pulverised to a very fine mesh size added to the<br>
mixture with thorough mixing.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
For the preparation of caplets, tyrosine and methionine are<br>
diluted separately with lactose (80~100mesh) as per homoeopathic<br>
method of dilution to 1000 times. Both the diluted forms of<br>
tyrosine and methionine are well mixed. Zinc sulphate is<br>
pulverised to very fine mesh. Powder obtained, ie. mixture of<br>
tyrosine + methionine are mixed geometrically with zinc<br>
sulphate powder. So all the three active ingredients are well<br>
mixed with lactose. This mixed powder is the starting for tablet<br>
(cap let) manufacture.<br>
These ingredients except talcum powder are mixed together<br>
thoroughly in tablet mixing drum for 45 mins.. The powder is then<br>
slugged, ie,, they are preliminary compression of fine powder into<br>
rough tablets or slugs followed by their grinding into granular<br>
particles. The granules are separated, mixed with lubricants, ie.<br>
talcum powder and compressed in suitable tablet punching machine.<br>
CAPSULE MAKING<br>
Powder of the three active ingredients for 50,000 capsules =<br>
50.05 kgs. are mixed with 1.5 kgs. light Mag. Carb. and 0.5 kgs.<br>
Aerosil and mixed thoroughly. Total weight terms to 52.05 kgs.<br>
Average weight of content of each capsule = 1.041 gms. approx..<br>
The powder is now filed in number "000" capsules.<br>
The preparation according to the invention has been administered<br>
to a number of patients and the results have been quite encoura-<br>
ging. The treatment is based on administering the preparation in<br>
daily doses with very low concentration of the constituents)<br>
alongwith application of the topical formulation. Application of<br>
the topical formulation on the affected area is fallowed by<br>
exposure to sunlight. The preparation works on the principle of<br>
Arndt., ie. weak stimuli excite-physiologic activity, moderately<br>
strong ones favour it, strong ones retard it and very strong ones<br>
arrest it. The results of the chemical trials is as follows:<br>
The preparation has been successfully used for treating vitiligo<br>
and has been particularly successful when the disease is detected<br>
in the early stages. Cure is passible within 15 days to 1m. If<br>
detected xn the late stages, ie. from a year to about 6 years<br>
old, cure is passible within 1 to 3 years. Extreme cases have so<br>
far not been cured.<br>
