				<td>WETLAID-SPUNBOND LAMINATE MEMBRANE SUPPORT<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to nonwoven fabrics suitable for use as<br>
filtration support media. The present invention is more specifically directed to<br>
nonwoven laminate fabrics suitable for use as precise filtration support media.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Precise filtration processes, such as reverse osmosis, nano-filtration, ultra-<br>
filtration and micro-filtration, are used within a wide range of applications,<br>
including seawater desalination, fruit juice production and industrial wastewater<br>
treatment, among others. Synthetic filtration membranes, commonly referred to as<br>
semipermeable membranes, are typically used in conjunction with precise filtration<br>
processes. Semipermeable membranes provide selective mass transport, generally<br>
allowing the molecules of the solvent, but not the solute, to pass through their<br>
thickness. Semipermeable membranes are generally a thin layer of polymer, such<br>
as a layer of cast film. Synthetic filtration membranes may be formed from a<br>
number of polymers, including cellulose acetate, polyamide, polysulfone,<br>
polyvinylidene fluoride polymers and the like.<br>
The process conditions encountered during filtration can be fairly rigorous.<br>
For example, elevated pressures of up to about 1200 psi may be employed to<br>
separate salt from seawater using reverse osmosis. Unfortunately, semipermeable<br>
membranes are typically relatively fragile. Laminate filter constructions<br>
incorporating a supporting substrate along with the semipermeable membrane are<br>
known to improve the durability of filtration media. Exemplary supporting<br>
substrates include a variety of porous materials, including sintered materials and<br>
nonwoven fabrics.<br>
-1-<br>
	AttyDktNo 38712/280313<br><br>
Laminate filter constructions were traditionally formed by casting the<br>
semipermeable membrane directly onto the supporting substrate. More recently,<br>
composite membranes, often referred to as Thin Film Composites ("TFC") have<br>
been developed. Composite membranes include a porous polymer layer, such as a<br>
porous polymer film, in addition to the semipermeable membrane. The porous<br>
polymer layer is typically located between the semipermeable membrane and the<br>
supporting substrate. The intermediate porous polymer layer allows much thinner<br>
semipermeable layers to be used, yielding higher flux rates.<br>
During filtration, the ingressing liquid stream is typically transported<br>
through the semipermeable or composite membrane initially, exiting through the<br>
supporting substrate. Consequently, the supporting substrate must provide strength<br>
properties while having a minimal effect on the semipermeable or composite<br>
membrane's transport properties, e.g. permeability or flux.<br>
Suitable supporting substrates, e.g., suitable nonwoven fabrics, exhibit a<br>
number of other advantageous properties, as well. For example, the supporting<br>
substrate should exhibit acceptable adhesion to the intermediate porous polymer<br>
layer or semipermeable membrane, to avoid delamination during filtration.<br>
Suitable adhesion may be achieved by allowing the intermediate porous polymer<br>
layer or semipermeable membrane to penetrate down into the surface of the<br>
supporting substrate. However, the penetration of the supporting substrate by the<br>
intermediate porous polymer layer or semipermeable membrane represents a<br>
delicate balance. Inadequate penetration yields unacceptable adhesion within the<br>
filter media. Over penetration of the supporting substrate, e.g., penetration by the<br>
intermediate porous polymer layer or semipermeable membrane to the surface<br>
opposing the cast surface, results in uneven filtration properties (e.g. reduced flux)<br>
and/or damage of the semipermeable membrane due to the partial excessive<br>
pressurization during filtration.<br>
In addition to the properties described above, supporting substrates should<br>
further advantageously provide a suitably smooth surface on which to apply the<br>
intermediate porous polymer layer or semipermeable membrane. Surface<br>
imperfections, particularly surface projections, create pinholes within the<br>
-2-<br>
	AttyDktNo 38712/280313<br><br>
intermediate porous polymer layer and/or the semipermeable membrane,<br>
detrimentally affecting filter performance.<br>
Supporting substrates made from nonwoven wet-laid fibers have been<br>
found to provide an advantageously smooth surface and acceptable affinity to<br>
semipermeable membranes. Exemplary wet-laid nonwoven webs intended for use<br>
as semi-permeable membrane supports are described in United States Patent No.<br>
5,851,355 to Goettmann, hereby incorporated by reference. Supporting substrates<br>
formed from nonwoven wet-laid fiber webs have been commercially available<br>
under the product name MEMBACKÂ® nonwovens, from BBA.<br>
Composite support constructions may be used to improve the economics of<br>
semipermeable filtration media, especially filtration supports incorporating wet-<br>
laid nonwoven webs. For example, United States Patent Nos. 4,728,394 and<br>
4,795,559 describe membrane supports that include a carded fiber layer bonded to<br>
a wet-laid web. However, although porous membranes incorporating carded webs<br>
provide a number of beneficial properties, such laminates can suffer from an<br>
unacceptable level of pinholes within the semipermeable or composite membrane.<br>
Carded webs are further a relatively expensive substrate.<br>
Consequently, a need remains for composite supports incorporating wet-<br>
laid fiber webs that provide improved surface properties. There further remains a<br>
need for composite supports incorporating wet-laid webs that can be produced<br>
more economically.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides composite supports exhibiting improved<br>
filter performance due to their advantageous surface properties. The instant<br>
composite supports may further be economically produced.<br>
The composite supports of the present invention include a wet-laid fiber<br>
web along with a spunbond fabric. Surprisingly, composite supports formed from<br>
wet laid and spunbond layers have been found to produce fewer surface disparities<br>
within the resulting filtration media.<br>
The composite supports of the invention generally include a first layer of<br>
spunbond nonwoven fabric formed of continuous thermoplastic polymer filaments<br>
-3-<br>
	AttyDktNo 38712/280313<br><br>
defining a first outer surface superposed with a second layer of wet-laid nonwoven<br>
fabric formed of discrete length thermoplastic polymer fibers defining a second<br>
outer surface. In preferred embodiments, the composite supports further include a<br>
thermoplastic polymer binder bonding the first and second layers to one another.<br>
In such embodiments, the thermoplastic polymer binder is in fibrous form. In<br>
further aspects, the thermoplastic polymer binder is adhered to the filaments of the<br>
first layer and to the fibers of the second layer.<br>
The continuous thermoplastic polymer filaments and discrete length<br>
thermoplastic polymer fibers may each independently be formed from a number of<br>
resins, including polyester and polyamide, and copolymers and mixtures thereof.<br>
In preferred embodiments of the invention, the continuous filaments of the first<br>
layer and the discrete length fibers of the second layer are formed of the same<br>
thermoplastic polymer.<br>
For example, the continuous thermoplastic polymer filaments and discrete<br>
length thermoplastic polymer fibers may both be formed from polyester polymer.<br>
In further aspects, the thermoplastic polymer binder comprises a polyester<br>
copolymer having a lower melting temperature than the polyester polymer used to<br>
form the filaments and discrete length fibers. The thermoplastic polymer binder<br>
may further be formed from a mixture of higher melting and lower melting<br>
polyester copolymers.<br>
The discrete length fibers within the wet-laid nonwoven fabric typically<br>
have a length of from about 2.5 to 40 mm and are from about 0.2 to 3.0 denier per<br>
filament (dpf). The filaments of the spunbond layer generally are from about 1 to<br>
10 denier per filament. The spunbond nonwoven generally has a basis weight of<br>
about 10 to 35 gsm and the wet-laid nonwoven fabric typically has a basis weight<br>
of about 30 to 70 gsm, with the resulting composite support having an overall basis<br>
weight of up to 80 gsm.<br>
Filtration devices may be formed in accordance with the invention by<br>
adhering either a composite membrane or a semipermeable membrane to the<br>
second outer surface the composite support, i.e. the outer surface of the wet-laid<br>
layer. Exemplary materials from which to form the semipermeable membrane<br>
include cellulose acetate ("CA"), cellulose triacetate, CA-cellulose triacetate<br>

blends, gelatin, polyamine, polyimide, poly(ether imides), aromatic polyamide,<br>
polybenzimidazole, polybenzimidazolone, polyacrylonitrile ("PAN"), PAN-<br>
poly(vinyl chloride) copolymer, polysulfone, polyethersulfone,<br>
poly(dimethylphenylene oxide), poly(vinylidene fluoride), polyelectrolyte<br>
complexes, polyolefins, poly(methyl methacrylate) and copolymers thereof.<br>
The present invention also includes processes by which to form the<br>
composite supports and filtration media of the invention. For example composite<br>
supports in accordance with the invention may be produced by (a) forming a<br>
spunbond nonwoven fabric first layer of continuous thermoplastic polymer<br>
filaments; (b) forming a wet-laid nonwoven fabric second layer of discrete length<br>
thermoplastic polymer fibers and (c) bonding the first and second layers in<br>
opposing face-to-face relationship whereby the first and second layers define first<br>
and second outer surfaces of the composite support, respectively.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The foregoing and other objects, features, and advantages of the present<br>
invention will be made apparent from the following detailed description of the<br>
invention and from the drawings, in which;<br>
FIG. 1 is a schematic illustration of an enlarged cross-sectional view of<br>
exemplary filtration media formed in accordance with the invention;<br>

filtration media in accordance with the present invention;<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present inventions now will be described more fully hereinafter with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings, in which some, but not all embodiments<br>
of the invention are shown. Indeed, these inventions may be embodied in many<br>
different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth<br>
herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy<br>
applicable legal requirements. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.<br>
-5-<br>
	AttyDktNo 38712/280313<br><br>
A cross-sectional view of exemplary filtration media in accordance with the<br>
present invention is provided in Figure 1. The filtration media 10 generally<br>
includes a composite membrane 11 adhered to a composite support 14. The<br>
composite membrane 11 generally includes a semipermeable membrane 12 and<br>
intermediate porous polymer layer 13. In alternative embodiments of the<br>
invention, the semipermeable membrane 12 may be used without the intermediate<br>
porous polymer layer 13, i.e. the intermediate porous polymer layer may be<br>
omitted from the filtration media 10. The composite support 14 includes (a) a first<br>
layer 16 formed of spunbond fabric defining a first outer surface 17 and (b) a<br>
second layer 18 formed of wet-laid fabric defining a second outer surface 22, i.e.,<br>
the casting surface.<br>
Although the filtration media, composite membranes and composite<br>
supports of the invention are referred to as containing "layers," this term is merely<br>
used to facilitate discussion concerning the differing compositions and/or<br>
constructions which may be present in various regions within the filtration media,<br>
composite membrane or composite support thickness. The filtration media,<br>
composite membranes and composite supports of the present invention, although<br>
referred to as being formed from such "layers," nevertheless provide unitary<br>
structures exhibiting cohesive properties throughout their thickness. Further, each<br>
"layer" is typically in direct liquid communication with its adjacent layer(s).<br>
The spunbond fabric which forms the first layer 16 includes a plurality of<br>
continuous thermoplastic polymer filaments. More particularly, the spunbond<br>
fabric typically includes from about 80 to 100% weight percent continuous<br>
thermoplastic polymer filaments. As used herein, the terms "filament" and<br>
"continuous filament" are used in a generic sense to refer to fibrous materials of<br>
indefinite or extreme length, such as a length of several feet or greater. The denier<br>
per filament ("dpf) of the continuous filaments within the first layer 16 typically<br>
ranges from about 1 to 10 dpf, such as from about 4 to 6 dpf. In certain preferred<br>
embodiments, the spunbond filaments within the first layer 16 have a fineness of<br>
about 4 dpf, particularly 4 dpf fibers with a trilobal cross sectional shape. In<br>
alternative embodiments, the spunbond filaments may have a mixture of deniers.<br>
-6-<br>
	AttyDktNo 38712/280313<br><br>
The continuous filaments within the spunbond first layer 16 may be formed<br>
from any fiber forming thermoplastic polymer providing acceptable mechanical<br>
properties and chemical resistance. For example, the continuous filaments may be<br>
formed from polyester homopolymers and/or copolymers, or from polyamide<br>
homopolymers and/or copolymers or mixtures thereof An exemplary polyester is<br>
polyethylene terephthalate. Exemplary polyamides include nylon 6 and nylon 6,6.<br>
In preferred embodiments of the invention, the continuous filaments within the<br>
first layer 16 are formed from polyethylene terephthalate.<br>
The first layer 16 may be formed from spunbond continuous filaments of<br>
various cross sections known in the art of fiber formation, including trilobal,<br>
quadlobal, pentalobal, circular, elliptical and dumbbell-shaped. Either a single<br>
cross-section or a mixture of filaments of differing cross section may be included<br>
within the first layer 16. In preferred embodiments of the invention, the first layer<br>
16 is formed from spunbond filaments having a trilobal cross section.<br>
Applicants have found that spunbond layers possessing fairly uniform<br>
structures provide an unexpectedly smooth casting surface 22. Surprisingly, the<br>
smoothness of the interfacial surface 20 of the spunbond layer 16 translates into a<br>
superior casting surface 22 on the opposing side of the wet-laid second layer 18.<br>
The first layer 16 further provides beneficial transport properties, e.g.<br>
porosity-permeability values. Exemplary porosity-permeability values for the first<br>
layer 16 ranges from about 800 to 1550 before calendering, such as porosity-<br>
permeability values ranging from about 1400 to 1550 (Textest Air Permeability).<br>
Porosity-permeability is generally related to density, such as apparent density, with<br>
higher density materials typically exhibiting lower porosity-permeability values.<br>
Exemplary apparent densities for the first layer 16 prior to calendering generally<br>
range from about 0.100 g/cc to 0.250 g/cc, such as apparent densities ranging from<br>
about 0.100 g/cc to 0.150 g/cc. The advantageous porosity-permeability values of<br>
the invention are unexpected in light of the density of the first layer 16. Although<br>
not wishing to be bound by theory, Applicants believe that such beneficial<br>
porosity-permeability values may be due the more open fiber structures provided<br>
by the continuous thermoplastic filaments in comparison to other nonwovens of<br>
comparable density.<br>
-7-<br>
	AttyDktNo 38712/280313<br><br>
To provide adequate interlaminar strength within the first layer 16, the<br>
continuous filaments within the spunbond first layer 16 are bonded to each other at<br>
points of contact. Although the continuous filaments within the spunbond first<br>
layer 16 are bonded, the nonwoven structure remains sufficiently open to provide<br>
beneficial flux properties, as indicated by the throughputs described above.<br>
However, although bonded at a level to insure adequate flux, the first layer 16 is<br>
nevertheless considered to be substantially fully bonded in that the spunbond<br>
filaments are bonded together at a plurality of crossover points. The bonding<br>
within the first layer 16 can be accomplished by any known means, such as by the<br>
melting of thermoplastic binder filaments, thermoplastic resin bonding, etc. In<br>
preferred embodiments, the first layer 16 is bonded using binder filaments. The<br>
binder filaments may be included within the first layer 16 in any amount effective<br>
to induce an adequate level of bonding. The binder filaments are typically present<br>
in the first layer 16 in an amount ranging from about 2 to 20 weight percent, such<br>
as an amount of about 10 weight percent. In alternative aspects of the invention,<br>
the spunbond filaments within the first layer 16 may be multiconstituent fibers that<br>
include a thermoplastic binder polymer as a component. For example, in such<br>
alternative embodiments the spunbond filaments may have a sheath/core<br>
configuration in which the sheath is formed from a binder polymer.<br>
The binder filaments within the first layer 16 are generally formed from<br>
any polymer exhibiting a melting or softening temperature at least about 10Â°C<br>
lower than the continuous filaments. The binder filaments may all be formed from<br>
the same polymer or may include a mixture of higher and lower melting binder<br>
filaments. For example, the binder filaments may include a mixture of filaments, a<br>
first portion of which have a lower melting temperature, such as about 225 Â°F, and<br>
a second portion of which have a higher melting temperature, such as about 375<br>
Â°F. Exemplary binder filaments may be formed from one or more lower melting<br>
polymers or copolymers, such as polyester copolymers. In one embodiment of the<br>
invention, the spunbond layer is produced by extruding polyester homopolymer<br>
matrix filaments (polyethylene terephthalate) interspersed with binder filaments<br>
formed from a lower melting polyester copolymer, particularly polyethylene<br>
isophthalate.<br>
-8-<br>
	AttyDktNo 38712/280313<br><br>
The binder filaments within the first layer 16 may have any cross-section<br>
known in the art. In preferred embodiments, the binder filaments within the first<br>
layer 16 have a trilobal cross-section. The binder filaments within the first layer 16<br>
may further have any denier or mixture of deniers known in the art for binding<br>
spunbond fabrics.<br>
The first layer 16 is typically characterized by a basis weight ranging from<br>
about 10 to 35 gsm, such as 12 to 25 gsm. Suitable spunbond fabrics for use as the<br>
first layer 16 are commercially available, such as REEMAY Style 2004 spunbond,<br>
from Reemay, Inc. of Old Hickory, Tennessee.<br>
In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1, the composite support 14 includes<br>
a single spunbond first layer 16. In alternative embodiments, the composite<br>
support 10 can include more than a single spunbond layer. For example, the<br>
composite support 10 may include two contiguous spunbond layers. For<br>
embodiments including at least two spunbond layers, the fibers and materials<br>
comprising the respective spunbond layers may be the same or may differ. For<br>
example, the spunbond layers may differ in composition, denier, basis weight or<br>
fiber cross-section.<br>
The second layer 18 is a wet-laid nonwoven fabric formed from a plurality<br>
of discrete length thermoplastic polymer fibers. More particularly, the wet-laid<br>
nonwoven fabric typically includes discrete length thermoplastic polymer fibers in<br>
amounts ranging from about 80 to 100 weight percent. As used herein the term<br>
"discrete length fibers" is used in a generic sense to describe fibrous materials<br>
which are not continuous in nature. Exemplary non-continuous fibers include<br>
staple fibers, wet-laid fibers and melt-blown fibers. Exemplary average lengths for<br>
the discrete length thermoplastic polymer fibers within the second layer 18<br>
generally range from about 2.5 to 40 mm, preferably from about 5 to 13 mm. In<br>
preferred embodiments, substantially all of the discrete length fibers have<br>
approximately the same length, such as a length ranging from about 5 mm to 13<br>
mm. In alternative aspects of the invention, a mixture of discrete fiber lengths may<br>
be employed.<br>
One important feature of the wet-laid second layer 18 is its permeability-<br>
porosity. More particularly, if the permeability-porosity of the second layer 18 is<br>
-9-<br>
	AttyDktNo 38712/280313<br><br>
too low, the semi-permeable membrane 12 will not bond to the composite support<br>
14. Consequently, the permeability-porosity of the second layer 18 typically<br>
ranges from about 5 to 30 cfin (Textest Air Permeability after calendering). Along<br>
with fiber length (described above), the permeability-porosity within the second<br>
layer 18 is influenced by the fiber stiffness, which is in turn reflected by the fiber<br>
denier. Accordingly, the denier per filament ("dpf') of the discrete length fibers<br>
within the second layer 18 typically ranges from about 0.2 to 3.0 dpf, such as from<br>
about 0.43 to 1.5 dpf. In certain embodiments, the discrete length fibers all have<br>
approximately the same denier. In alternative embodiments, discrete length fibers<br>
having a mixture of deniers may be employed within the second layer 18.<br>
The discrete length fibers within the second layer 18 may be formed from<br>
any fiber forming thermoplastic polymer providing acceptable mechanical<br>
properties and chemical resistance. For example, the discrete length fibers may be<br>
formed from homopolymers of polyester or polyamide, or mixtures or copolymers<br>
thereof. An exemplary polyester from which the discrete length fiber may be<br>
formed is polyethylene terephthalate. Exemplary polyamides include nylon 6 and<br>
nylon 6,6. In preferred aspects of the invention, the discrete length fiber is formed<br>
from polyethylene terephthalate.<br>
The discrete length fibers within the second layer 18 may have any cross-<br>
section known in the art of fiber formation. In preferred embodiments, the discrete<br>
length fibers have a circular cross-section. In alternative embodiments, the discrete<br>
length fibers may have a cross-section imparting greater stiffness. Exemplary stiff<br>
fiber cross sections include any non-circular fibers defining four or more lobes,<br>
i.e., quadralobal (cross-shaped), pentalobal and the like, having any suitable<br>
modification ratio or dimensional relationship. The second layer 18 may be<br>
formed from discrete length fibers having a single cross-sectional configuration.<br>
Alternatively, the discrete length fibers within the second layer 18 may include a<br>
mixture of cross-sectional configurations.<br>
The discrete length fibers are bonded to each other at points of contact, but<br>
the second layer 18 remains sufficiently open to provide beneficial transport<br>
properties. The second layer 18 is considered to be substantially fully bonded in<br>
that the discrete length fibers are bonded together at a plurality of crossover points.<br>
-10-<br>
	AttyDktNo 38712/280313<br><br>
The bonding within the second layer 18 can be independently accomplished by any<br>
known means, such as by the melting of binder fibers, resin bonding, etc. In<br>
preferred embodiments, the second layer 18 is bonded using binder fibers and thus<br>
further includes binder fibers. The binder fiber may be included within the second<br>
layer 18 in any amount effective to induce an adequate level of bonding. The<br>
binder fiber is typically present in the second layer 18 in amounts ranging up to<br>
about 60 weight percent, such as in amounts ranging up to about 40 weight<br>
percent. In alternative aspects of the invention, the discrete length fibers within the<br>
second layer 18 are multiconstituent fibers that include a binder polymer as a<br>
component. For example, in such alternative embodiments the discrete length<br>
fibers may have a sheath/core configuration in which the sheath is formed from a<br>
binder polymer.<br>
The binder fibers within the second layer 18 are generally formed from any<br>
polymer exhibiting a melting or softening temperature at least about 10Â°C lower<br>
than the discrete length fibers. The binder fibers may all be formed from the same<br>
polymer or may include a mixture of higher and lower melting binder fibers. For<br>
example, the binder fibers may include a mixture of fibers, a first portion of which<br>
have a lower melting temperature, such as about 225Â°F, and a second portion of<br>
which have a higher melting temperature, such as about 375Â°F. Exemplary binder<br>
fibers may be formed from one or more low melting polyolefin polymers or<br>
copolymers, one or more low melting polyester polymers or copolymers or<br>
mixtures thereof. In preferred embodiments of the invention, the binder fiber is<br>
formed from a low melting polyester copolymer, particularly polyethylene<br>
isophthalate.<br>
The binder fibers within the second layer 18 may have any cross-section<br>
known in the art. In preferred embodiments, the binder fibers within the second<br>
layer 18 have a circular cross-section. The binder fibers within the second layer 18<br>
may further have any denier or mixture of deniers known in the art for binding<br>
nonwoven fabrics.<br>
The materials and process conditions associated with the second layer 18<br>
are selected so as to provide a smooth casting surface 22. The second layer 18<br>
typically provides a porosity-permeability after calendering ranging from about 5<br>
-11-<br>
	AttyDktNo 38712/280313<br><br>
to 30 cfm Textest Air Permeability, depending on the substrate's performance<br>
need. The second layer 18 is typically characterized by a basis weight ranging<br>
from about 30 to 70 gsm, such as from about 40 to 60 gsm. Suitable wet-laid<br>
fabrics for use as the second layer 18 have been commercially available, such as<br>
MEMBACKÂ® nonwovens, from BBA.<br>
In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1, the composite support 14 includes<br>
a single wet-laid second layer 18. In alternative embodiments, the composite<br>
support 14 includes more than a single wet-laid layer. For example, the composite<br>
support 14 may include two contiguous wet-laid layers. For embodiments<br>
including at least two wet-laid layers, the fibers and materials comprising the<br>
respective wet-laid layers may be the same or may differ. For example, the wet-<br>
laid layers may differ in composition, average denier, basis weight or fiber cross-<br>
section.<br>
The composite support 14 formed by the combination of the first layer 16<br>
and the second layer 18 generally has a thickness ranging from approximately 2 to<br>
8 mils, such as a thickness of about 3 to 4 mils. The composite support 14 is<br>
further typically characterized by a basis weight of less than about 80 gsm, such as<br>
a basis weight ranging from about 40 to 70 gsm. The composite support 14<br>
generally provides a porosity-permeability ranging from about 5 to 30 cfrn Textest<br>
Air Permeability.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, the filtration media 10 of the invention further includes<br>
a composite membrane 11, adhered to the casting surface 22 of the composite<br>
support 14. The composite membrane 11 includes a semipermeable membrane 12<br>
and an intermediate porous polymer layer 13.<br>
Any intermediate porous polymer layer 13 known in the art of precise<br>
filtration may be used in conjunction with the composite support 14. Polysulphone<br>
is one example of material which may be used to form the intermediate porous<br>
polymer layer 13. As known in the art, intermediate porous polymer layers<br>
typically have a cellular structure that resembles tiny tubes extending from one<br>
plane to the next. The intermediate porous polymer layer 13 generally improves<br>
the surface smoothness, allowing the use of thinner semipermeable membranes 12,<br>
thereby increasing throughput. The intermediate porous polymer layer 13 typically<br>
-12-<br>
	AttyDktNo 38712/280313<br><br>
ranges in thickness from about 40 to 70 microns, such as from about 45 to 65<br>
microns, particularly from about 45 to 50 microns.<br>
Any semipermeable membranes known in the art of reverse osmosis,<br>
ultrafiltration, nanofiltration or micro-filtration may be used in conjunction with<br>
the composite support 14, Non-limiting exemplary semipermeable membranes<br>
include polymeric films formed from cellulose acetate ("CA"), cellulose triacetate,<br>
CA-cellulose triacetate blends, gelatin, polyamine, polyimide, poly(ether imides),<br>
aromatic polyamide, polybenzimidazole, polybenzimidazolone, polyacrylonitrile,<br>
PAN-poly(vinyl chloride) copolymer, polysulfone, polyethersulfone,<br>
poly(dimethylphenylene oxide), poly(vinylidene fluoride), polyelectrolyte<br>
complexes, polyolefins, poly(methyl methacrylate) and copolymers and mixtures<br>
of these materials.<br>
Semipermeable membranes suitable for use with the present invention may<br>
have any thickness known in the art for such membranes, such as a thickness<br>
ranging from about 25 angstroms to 100 microns, preferably about 1 micron. In<br>
some embodiments, the semipermeable membranes are asymmetrical in nature.<br>
In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1, the filtration media 10 includes a<br>
single semipermeable membrane 12 and a single intermediate porous polymer<br>
layer 13. In alternative embodiments of the invention, the filtration media may<br>
include multiple semipermeable membrane layers and/or multiple intermediate<br>
porous polymer layers. In such embodiments, each of the semipermeable<br>
membrane and/or porous polymer layers may be the same or may differ is some<br>
respect, such as differing compositions or configurations.<br>
The composite membrane 11 impregnates at least the outermost surface of<br>
the composite support 14 to provide adequate adhesion to the resulting filtration<br>
media 10. However, although impregnating the outermost region of the composite<br>
support 14, the composite membrane 11 does not over-penetrate the composite<br>
support 14. For example, the composite membrane 11 does not penetrate through<br>
the entire thickness of the composite support 14, i.e., to the outer surface 17 of the<br>
first layer 16. The absence of such over-penetration is surprising in light of the<br>
more open fiber structure provided by the continuous filaments within the<br>
-13-<br>
	AttyDktNo 38712/280313<br><br>
spunbond layer 16 in comparison to nonwoven webs formed of discontinuous<br>
filaments, such as staple fibers.<br>
Applicants hypothesize that the continuous filaments within the spunbond<br>
first layer 16 result in a smoother casting surface 22 in comparison to conventional<br>
composite supports incorporating carded nonwovens. Although not wishing to the<br>
bound by theory, Applicants have found that the surface roughness of intermediate<br>
surfaces within the composite support, such as the surface of the spunbond layer<br>
contacting the wet-laid layer 18, ultimately affects the surface properties of the<br>
opposing surface of the wetlaid layer, i.e. the casting surface 22. The superior<br>
smoothness imparted by the continuous filaments within the first layer 16 is further<br>
surprising in light of the fact that carded staple fiber webs, i.e., webs formed of<br>
longer discrete length fibers, impart greater casting surface roughness to composite<br>
supports in comparison to membrane supports formed of a single layer of shorter<br>
discrete length fibers, i.e., wet-laid fibers. The smoother casting surfaces of the<br>
invention generally result in fewer holes and/or voids within the composite<br>
membrane 11.<br>
The absence of holes and voids within the composite membrane 11 is<br>
generally reflected by higher efficiencies within the filtration media. Higher<br>
efficiencies are typically evidenced by a combination of elevated filtrate rejection<br>
characteristics and permeate throughputs.<br>
The filtration media 10 may be formed using manufacturing processes<br>
known in the industry. Referring now to FIG. 2, an illustrative process for forming<br>
advantageous embodiments of the filtration media 10 is provided. As shown, the<br>
composite support may be produced by (1) forming the first layer via a spunbond<br>
process and the second layer via a wet-laid process, 24 and 24a, respectively;<br>
(2) bonding the spunbond and wet-laid fabrics to form a composite support, 26;<br>
and (3) applying a composite membrane to the composite support, 28.<br>
The first layer can be produced using any conventional spunbonding<br>
apparatus capable of forming a nonwoven fabric from substantially continuous<br>
thermoplastic polymer filaments and binder filaments. Spunbonding generally<br>
involves extruding and subsequently attenuating continuous filaments as they are<br>
being deposited onto a moving collection surface or screen. The filaments collect<br>
-14-<br>
	AttyDktNo 38712/280313<br><br>
in the form of a web, which is then conveyed on the screen to a thermal fusion<br>
station, preferably a pair of cooperating calender rolls, to provide a spunbond<br>
fabric. The web is bonded together to provide a multiplicity of thermal bonds<br>
distributed throughout the spunbond fabric. The bonded spunbond fabric is then<br>
wound up by conventional means on a roll. Spunbonding processes and apparatus<br>
are well known to the skilled artisan.<br>
As indicated in FIG. 2, the second layer is typically formed in a separate<br>
wet-laying process. Any wet-laid process known in the art may be used to form<br>
the second layer. Wet-laying processes generally involve depositing a layer of<br>
fibers suspended within an aqueous slurry, commonly referred to as a furnish, onto<br>
a continuous screen. In preferred embodiments, the fibers within the wet laid layer<br>
are randomly deposited to give the web isotropic properties that are nondirectional<br>
in nature. Water from the furnish is drawn through the screen, leaving behind an<br>
initial wet-laid web. A stack of drying rollers removes additional water from the<br>
initial wet-laid web and consolidates the web. The dried wet-laid web exits the<br>
drying rollers and is wound up by conventional means on a roll. Wet-laid<br>
processes and apparatus are known to the skilled artisan and are disclosed, for<br>
example in U.S. Patent No. 5,851,355 to Goettmann.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, the composite support 14 is subsequently produced by<br>
bonding the preformed spunbond and wet-laid layers. Advantageously, the layers<br>
are bonded together to provide a multiplicity of thermal bonds between the<br>
spunbond and wet-laid fabrics. A plurality of vertically stacked rolls may be used<br>
to bond the preformed spunbond and wet-laid layers, as illustrated in FIG. 3. As<br>
shown, the vertically stacked rolls define multiple nips, and the preformed layers<br>
pass through the multiple nips in a serpentine pattern. Each nip within the bonding<br>
apparatus of FIG. 3 may be independently heated and loaded. In alternative<br>
embodiments, a series of horizontal rolls may be used to form multiple bonding<br>
nips, each of which may similarly be independently heated and loaded.<br>
As shown in FIG. 3, the spunbond 80 and wet-laid 82 webs are unwound<br>
from rolls 84 and 86, respectively. The rolls of spunbond web 84 and wet-laid web<br>
86 are arranged so that, upon unwinding, the spunbond 80 and wet-laid 82 layers<br>
are superposed in an opposing face-to-face relationship.<br>
-15-<br>
	AttyDktNo 38712/280313<br><br>
The superposed layers 88 are subsequently conveyed longitudinally<br>
through a first nip 90. Within the first nip 90, the binder filaments in the spunbond<br>
fabric and the binder fibers in the wet-laid web begin to soften and fuse to adhere<br>
the layers together. The first nip 90 is constructed in a conventional manner as<br>
known to the skilled artisan. In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 3, the first nip<br>
90 is defined by a pair of cooperating calender rolls 94 and 96, which are<br>
preferably smooth and advantageously formed from steel. The cooperating<br>
calender rolls 94 and 96 preferably provide a fixed gap nip. The fixed gap nip<br>
ensures that the superposed layers 88 will not exit the first nip 90 thinner than the<br>
targeted gap thickness, regardless of any excess pressure that may be applied. In<br>
the advantageous embodiment illustrated in FIG. 3, pressure is applied to the first<br>
nip 90 using a topmost roll 97.<br>
Bonding conditions, including the temperature and pressure of the first nip<br>
90, are known in the art for differing polymers. For composite supports<br>
comprising polyethylene terephthalate nonwoven spunbond and wet-laid fabrics<br>
which both further include polyethylene isophthalate binder filaments and/or<br>
fibers, the first nip 90 is preferably heated to a temperature between about 120 Â°C<br>
and 230 Â°C, preferably from about 200 to 225 Â°C. The first nip 90 is typically run<br>
at pressures ranging from about 40 to 350 pounds per linear inch (pli), such as<br>
from about 80 to 200 pli.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, shown by broken lines, the two superposed<br>
layers 88 can be partially wrapped around an additional roll, e.g. passing over the<br>
top roll 97 and then through the nip defined between rolls 97 and 94, which is<br>
heated to a temperature of about 200Â°C prior to passing through the nip 90 between<br>
rolls 94, 96. Passing the superposed webs 88over the additional heated roll 97<br>
prior to the calender rolls 94, 96 preheats the superposed layers 88 before they<br>
enter the nip 90. Such preheating allows increased bonding speeds.<br>
Returning now to FIG.3, the superposed layers exiting the first nip 90<br>
subsequently enters a second nip 98. The second nip 98 is formed by a top roll 96<br>
and a bottom roll 104. The rolls 96 and 104 are preferably steel.<br>
The pressure within the second nip 98 is typically higher than the pressure<br>
in the first nip 90, further compressing the superposed layers exiting the first nip<br>
-16-<br>
	AttyDktNo 38712/280313<br><br>
90. Consequently, the gap formed by the second nip 98 is narrower than the gap<br>
provided by the first nip 90. The pressure in the second nip 98 is typically about<br>
120 to 1100 pli, such as from about 180 to 320 pli. The second nip 98 may further<br>
be heated, such as to a temperature ranging from about 120 to 230Â°C, preferably<br>
from about 200Â°C to 225Â°C. The resultant bonded composite support 14 exiting<br>
the second nip 98 may be transported over a chill roll 106 and wound up by<br>
conventional means on a roll 112.<br>
Although a bonding apparatus in the form of a series of calender rolls is<br>
illustrated in FIG. 3, other bonding apparatus such as ultrasonic, microwave or<br>
other RF treatment zones which are capable of bonding the superposed layers can<br>
be substituted for the calender rolls of FIG. 3. Such conventional thermal<br>
treatment stations are known to those skilled in the art and are capable of effecting<br>
substantial thermal fusion of the two nonwoven webs. It is also possible to achieve<br>
bonding through the use of an appropriate bonding agent as is known in the art,<br>
singly or in combination with thermal fusion.<br>
Returning now to FIG. 2, the filtration media is then formed by casting or<br>
otherwise applying or coating the composite or semipermeable membrane onto the<br>
composite support. Methods by which to apply composite and semipermeable<br>
membranes to porous supports are known to the skilled artisan and are disclosed,<br>
for example in U.S. Patent No. 4,277,344 to Cadotte; U.S. Patent No. 5,522,991 to<br>
Tuccelli et al. and U.S. Patent No. 6,132,804 to Rice et al. In general, the<br>
composite or semipermeable membrane may be applied to the composite support<br>
by means such as dip coating, extrusion coating, knife-over-roll coating, slot<br>
coating and the like. The thickness of the composite or semipermeable membrane<br>
may vary widely, depending upon the specific membrane composition and<br>
filtration application, as known in the art. Subsequent to coating application, the<br>
composite or semipermeable membrane is subjected to a solification process to<br>
bond the composite or semipermeable membrane to the composite support.<br>
Various solidification processes are known to the skilled artisan and may be<br>
employed in conjunction with the present invention. Exemplary solidification<br>
processes include hot air drying, interfacial polymerization, crosslinking and the<br>
-17-<br>
	AttyDktNo 38712/280313<br><br>
like. The resulting filtration media exits the solidification process and is wound up<br>
by conventional means on a roll.<br>
In embodiments of the invention directed to composite membranes or<br>
multiple semipermeable membrane layers, the various layers may be applied to the<br>
composite support using consecutive coating processes, such as consecutive slot<br>
coatings, as described in U.S. Patent No. 6,132,804 to Rice et al. In such<br>
embodiments, further preservation steps may be required to assure maintenance of<br>
the pore structure provided by the interior membrane layers, as known in the art.<br>
The particular membrane support employed will typically be determined<br>
either by the type of separation/filtration process in which it is used and/or the<br>
requirements of the semipermeable or composite membrane casting process.<br>
Regardless of substrate configuration, porosity is an important property for a<br>
properly functioning membrane support. Substrate thickness is another important<br>
factor to consider, because thickness affects the total membrane area that can be<br>
accommodated into a filtration module. Generally, thinner membrane supports<br>
allow greater membrane area within a filtration module, equating to a higher<br>
module output. The use of lighter weight membrane supports further yields<br>
significant cost savings to the user, In addition to suitable porosity and minimal<br>
thickness, composite supports of the invention advantageously provide uniformity<br>
in their thickness, have good adhesion to the composite or semipermeable<br>
membrane, have a minimal number of surface defects which could lead to pinholes<br>
and are strong enough to withstand the membrane casting process.<br>
The composite supports of the invention may be advantageously used to<br>
form filtration media, particularly semipermeable membrane filtration media<br>
employed in reverse osmosis, ultrafiltration and nanofiltration applications.<br>
However, the nonwoven laminates of the invention may also be suitable for a<br>
number of non-filtration applications, as well. For example, the nonwoven<br>
laminates of the invention may be employed in any application in which a strong,<br>
smooth material is desired. Particularly advantageous non-filtration applications<br>
for the nonwoven laminates of the invention include banner and signage stock.<br>

processes well known in the art. The wetlaid and spunbond fabric layers were<br>
bonded into a composite support using the process described in conjunction with<br>
Figure 3. The pressure between the thermal bonding rolls ranged from about 80 to<br>
200 pli, while the temperature of the thermal bonding nip was about 225Â°C. The<br>
pressure between the surface compaction rolls ranged from about 180 to 320 psi,<br>
while the temperature of the surface compaction nip was about 223Â°C.<br>
