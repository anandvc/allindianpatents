NEAR FIELD COMMUNICATION HOST CONTROLLER<br>
INTERFACE<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a communication interface between a near field<br>
communication (NFC) host and an NFC device.<br>
Background Art<br>
Universality and compatibility regarding a communication interface between an<br>
NFC host and an NFC device or an NFC chipset are required. An interface between a<br>
host such as an MSM chip of a mobile handset and a micro controller unit (MCU) of a<br>
mobile apparatus, and a device or a chipset connected to the host should be handled<br>
with great importance.<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates interfaces between various NFC host (NFCH) and various NFC<br>
devices or NFC chipsets (NFCC). An interface between an NFCH A 110 and an NFCC<br>
A 210 is connected to an upper layer 111 on the basis of a relevant driver interface 112<br>
suitably realized for a driver A 113 connected to the NFCC A 210 via a serial bus. An<br>
interface between other NFCH B 120 and other NFCC B 220 is connected to an upper<br>
layer 121 on the basis of a relevant driver interface 122 suitably realized for a driver B<br>
123 connected to the NFCC B 220 via a serial bus. An interface between another<br>
NFCH C 130 and another NFCC 230 is connected to an upper layer 131 on the basis of<br>
a relevant driver interface 132 suitably realized for a driver C 133 connected to the<br>
NFCC C 230 via a serial bus.<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, for a predetermined host, a device or a chipset connected to the<br>
predetermined host establishes a relevant driver interface using a driver suitably<br>
realized for the device or the chipset. Therefore, interfaces between the host and the<br>
chipset or the device are different from each other, and do not guarantee mutual com-<br>
patibility or universality.<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates disadvantages that can be generated in the case where mutual com-<br>
patibility or universality is not guaranteed in interfaces between a host and a chipset or<br>
a device. When an interface suitable for the NFCC 210 is established with respect to a<br>
predetermined NFCH 100, other NFCCs 220 and 230 cannot be connected to the host<br>
100 on the basis of different drivers 123 and 133.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Problem<br>
When interfaces between a host and a device or a chipset connected to the host are<br>
different for each host, each device, or each chipset, mutual compatibility or uni-<br><br>
versality is not guaranteed.<br>
As described above, referring to Fig. 2, a control interface between different devices<br>
requiring different interfaces requires design and development of a new driver and a<br>
new driver interface suitable for each host and each device, and requires mounting of<br>
the driver and the driver interface within the device not only in an aspect of a host but<br>
also in an aspect of the device or the chipset.<br>
An object of the present invention is to define an interface between a host and a<br>
device or a chipset connected to the host, and to conform to the defined interface,<br>
thereby guaranteeing universality and compatibility to a host controller interface<br>
between different devices.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to define a data format for transmitting<br>
data between an NFCH and an NFC device or an NFC chipset, and a process of the<br>
data format, and to provide an interface between devices by conforming to the defined<br>
format and the process thereof, thereby guaranteeing universality and compatibility to<br>
a host controller interface between different devices.<br>
Technical Solution<br>
To achieve these and other advantages and in accordance with the purpose of the<br>
present invention, as embodied and broadly described, there is provided a com-<br>
munication method between a host and a device in a communication interface between<br>
the host and the device connected to the host, the method including: transmitting a<br>
command message from the host to the device; transmitting a response message from<br>
the device to the host in response to the command message; transmitting data between<br>
the host and the device; and transmitting an event message from the device to the host<br>
when needed.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a com-<br>
munication method between a host and a device in a communication interface between<br>
the host and the device connected to the host, the method including: transmitting a<br>
command message from the host to the device, the command message including data<br>
expressing a kind of a message, data expressing contents of a message, and additional<br>
data; transmitting an event message or transmitting a response message from the<br>
device, the response message including data expressing a kind of a message, data<br>
expressing contents of a message, and additional data; and transmitting information<br>
expressing data and a message including the data between the host and the device in<br>
response to the command or the response message when needed.<br>
According to further another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a<br>
communication method between a near field communication host and a near field com-<br>
munication device in a communication interface between the host and the device<br><br>
connected to the host, the method including: transmitting a command message from<br>
the host to the device, the command message including one of recording data, reading<br>
data of the device, requesting the device to transmit predetermined data, and setting the<br>
device; transmitting a response message informing a performance result of a relevant<br>
command from the device to the host in response to the command message; and<br>
transmitting an event message from the device to the host when needed.<br>
Advantageous Effects<br>
According to the present invention, universality and compatibility in a com-<br>
munication between a host MCU and an NFC device or a chipset are guaranteed.<br>
According to the present invention, universality and compatibility of an interface<br>
regarding a command, a response, data, and an event message in a communication<br>
between an NFC host and an NFC device or a chipset are guaranteed.<br>
According to the present invention, an NFC device or an NFC chipset can be used<br>
without a device driver, a middle ware, or an application modification in an aspect of<br>
an NFCH. Also, according to the present invention, universality and compatibility in<br>
an interface between a host and an NFC device or an NFC chipset can be achieved<br>
even though a driver suitable for each host is not realized in an aspect of the NFC<br>
device or the NFC chipset.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Fig. 3 is a view explaining a host controller interface (HCI) concept according to<br>
the present invention. An NFCH, and an NFC chipset or an NFC device conform to a<br>
format and a process according to the present invention. According to the present<br>
invention, an arbitrary NFCH 100 has a common interface driver 120 with respect to<br>
interfaces 112, 122, and 132 corresponding to various kinds of drivers, and an arbitrary<br>
NFC chipset (an NFC device is included hereinafter) 200 is connected to a common<br>
device driver 130 including the HCI via a communication line, e.g., a serial bus as one<br>
embodiment. Also, an extended interface 125 for the common device driver is further<br>
provided in order to give extensibility. Accordingly, a driver area 135 that can be<br>
freely defined and used by a vendor is further provided.<br>
Referring to Fig. 3, it is possible to guarantee mutual compatibility and universality<br>
in a series of control operations including data transmission between different devices<br>
by having devices conform to a format and a process determined in association with an<br>
interface between an NFCH and an NFC chipset.<br>
Fig. 4 is a view explaining advantages in the case where a host controller interface<br>
according to the present invention is adopted. When a host such as a mobile handset<br>
and a digital television receiver conforms to an NFC HCI of the present invention, the<br>
host can be freely used with compatibility and universality guaranteed without a device<br>
driver or a middle ware (MW) with respect to any NFC chipset (NFC IC). Also, when<br>
the NFC IC conforms to the NFC HCI, the NFC IC can be freely used with com-<br>
patibility and universality guaranteed without a difficulty associated with a host driver<br>
with respect to any NFC host.<br>
Fig. 5 is a view illustrating an exemplary structure of an NFCH and an NFC device<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention. Fig. 5 illustrates inner structures<br>
of a host 500, an NFC device 600, and a secure element 700. The host (i.e., NFCH)<br>
500 includes a logical link control protocol (LLCP), a reader/writer, an NFC data<br>
exchange format (NDEF), a card emulation module (e.g., NFCIP-1, ISO 14443B), and<br>
a record type definition (RTD) that are located above a device discovery and a mode<br>
switch stack. Also, the host 500 further includes respective secure element input/<br>
output(I/O) parts (e.g., a secure element I/O firmware (F/W) and a secure element I/O<br>
hardware (H/W)), serial input/output(I/O) parts (e.g., a serial I/O firmwawr(F/W) and a<br>
serial I/O hardware(H/W)). And the host 500 is connected to the NFC device 600 and<br>
the secure element 700 on the basis of an NFC HCI.<br><br>
The NFC device 600 is connected to the host 500 and the secure element 700 on the<br>
basis of the NFC HCI, and connected to the host 500 and the secure element 700 on the<br>
basis of a serial I/O part (e.g., a serial I/O F/W and SE I/O F/W and H/W). Also, the<br>
NFC device 600 includes a device discovery and a mode switch stack, a card<br>
emulation module, and an NFC RF H/W.<br>
The secure element 700 includes a card application, an NFC HCI, a secure element<br>
I/O part (e.g., a secure element I/O F/W and H/W) and is connected to the host 500 and<br>
the NFC device 600.<br>
Here, the serial FO F/W controls a serial port such as a universal asynchronous<br>
receiver and transmitter (UART) or a universal serial bus (USB). Fig. 5 illustrates an<br>
HCI path, a physical serial I/O path, and a physical path for a secure element using<br>
dotted lines and a solid line.<br>
A structure of host-device-secure element illustrated in Fig. 5 is a mere example,<br>
and an NFC system of the present invention is not limited to an embodiment illustrated<br>
herein. Respective inner structures of the above-described host, device, and card-based<br>
secure system, physical structures thereof, and a communication method including<br>
modules mounted thereon can be more freely designed and modified, and can be easily<br>
realized by a person of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
Fig. 6 is a view illustrating an example of an interface control process in a reader/<br>
writer mode according to an embodiment of the present invention. Fig. 6 illustrates a<br>
process, i.e., a host controller interface (HCI) that can be performed between a host A<br>
and an NFC device. The host performs a device scan process on the device (S110). Ac-<br>
cordingly, device discovery, single device detection are performed. A card detection<br>
response (Card_Detected) therefor is delivered to the host (S120). The host performs a<br>
card read process (Read_Card) in response to the card detection (S130). At this point, a<br>
data exchange protocol can be applied. Data is received (Data_Received) from the<br>
NFC device to the NFCH (S140). When data reception is completed, the host performs<br>
a card deselect process (Deselect_Card) (S150). When the card deselect process is<br>
completed, the NFC device performs a relevant response (Deselect_Card) on the NFC<br>
host (S160).<br>
Referring to Fig. 6, a command and a response operate in a pair in the HCI<br>
according to the present invention, which will be described later in detail.<br>
Fig. 7 is a view illustrating an example of an interface control process in a peer<br>
mode according to an embodiment of the present invention. That is, Fig. 7 illustrates<br>
how the NFC HCI operates in a peer-to-peer communication. A host A and a host B<br>
communicate with each other on the basis of an NFC A and an NFC B, respectively.<br>
The host A performs a session open (LLC_Open_Session) process on the host B on the<br>
basis of the NFC A and NFC B (S210-S230). The host B performs a session open ac-<br><br>
knowledge (LLC_Open_Session_Ack) process on the host A on the basis of the NFC<br>
B and NFC A. That is, the peer-to-peer communication can be freely performed with<br>
compatibility and universality guaranteed by conforming to the NFC HCI of the<br>
present invention.<br>
Fig. 8 is a view illustrating an exemplary method for transmitting data according to<br>
an embodiment of the present invention. Here, the method for transmitting data<br>
without a data loss by preventing overflow when transmitting data is illustrated. That<br>
is, a data transmission party performs data segmentation and transmits the segmented<br>
data and related data to a data reception party with consideration of a size of a device<br>
buffer. The data reception party receives the transmitted and segmented data to re-<br>
construct the segmented data, so that the original data can be received without a loss.<br>
An example of the related data when the segmented data is transmitted includes data<br>
size-related data. Data related to a buffer size of a device in the reception party is<br>
obtained during a transmission operation, and data is transmitted using the obtained<br>
buffer size-related data.<br>
Fig. 9 is a view illustrating an example of an interface control process between an<br>
NFCH and an NFC device according to an embodiment of the present invention. That<br>
is, Fig. 9 illustrates a series of processes of segmenting data and transmitting the<br>
segmented data with consideration of a buffer size of a device, thereby preventing a<br>
data loss.<br>
A command (HCI_GET_BUFFER_SIZE command message) requesting a buffer<br>
size of a device is delivered from an NFCH to an HFC device (S310).<br>
The NFC device delivers buffer size data (HCI_GET_BUFFER_SIZE response<br>
message) expressed by m bytes to the NFCH in response to the command requesting<br>
the buffer size of the device (S320). The NFCH transmits first data that has been<br>
obtained by segmenting a size of data to be transmitted with consideration of the buffer<br>
size (m bytes) on the basis of the buffer size data of the device (Command Protocol<br>
Message)(S330). The NFC device transmits a response<br>
(HCI_SIZE_COMPLETE_DATA event) that the data has been completely received<br>
(S340). This response can be performed by returning m bytes. The next operations<br>
S350, S360, and S370 describe a process of transmitting the rest data and receiving a<br>
response thereof in the same way. When transmission of all data to be transmitted from<br>
the NFCH to the NFC device is completed in this manner, the NFC device transmits a<br>
message informing that data transmission has been completed to the NFCH, and ends<br>
the process (Response Protocol Message). This response can be performed by<br>
returning a necessary parameter.<br>
Fig. 10 is a view illustrating an exemplary structure of an interface between an<br>
NFCH and an NFC chipset (or an NFC device) according to an embodiment of the<br><br>
present invention. Communication is performed between the NFCH 10 and the NFC<br>
device 20 on the basis of a command 30, a response 40, and an event 50. The<br>
command 30 is delivered from the NFCH 10 to the NFC device 20. The response 40 is<br>
delivered from the NFC device 20 to the NFCH 10. The event 50 is delivered from the<br>
NFC device 20 to the NFCH 10, and independent with respect to the command and the<br>
response. The command 30 and the response 40 act in a pair. An event process is<br>
performed through asynchronous messaging.<br>
Fig. 11 is a view illustrating another exemplary structure of an interface between an<br>
NFCH and an NFC chipset (or an NFC device) according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention. Communication is performed between the NFCH 10 and the NFC<br>
device 20 on the basis of a command 30, a response 40, and an event 50. In addition, a<br>
data transmission process 60 is provided. The command 30 is delivered from the<br>
NFCH 10 to the NFC device 20. The response 40 is delivered from the NFC device 20<br>
to the NFCH 10. The event 50 is delivered from the NFC device 20 to the NFCH 10,<br>
and independent with respect to the command and the response. The command 30 and<br>
the response 40 act in a pair. An event process is performed through asynchronous<br>
messaging. The data 60 is delivered from the NFCH 10 to the NFC device 20, or from<br>
the NFC device 20 to the NFCH 10. That is, the data transmission process is based on<br>
bi-directional communication. The interface process and the structure thereof il-<br>
lustrated in Figs. 11 and 12 is a mere example, and the HCI process of the present<br>
invention is not limited thereto.<br>
Fig. 12 is a view illustrating an example of a message format according to an embo<br>
diment of the present invention. This is just one embodiment, and a message format<br>
according to the present invention is not limited thereto. Referring to Fig. 12, a general<br>
message format according to an embodiment of the present invention includes a<br>
message descriptor field (MDESC), a node address field (NAD), and a payload field.<br>
The MDESC field and the NAD field can be considered as a mandatory part, and the<br>
payload field can be considered as an optional part. In the message format of Fig. 12,<br>
the MDESC has 1 byte, the NAD has 1 byte or 2 bytes, and the payload has 0-255<br>
bytes, but these values are mere examples.<br>
Fig. 13 is a view illustrating an example of a message descriptor field (MDESC) in<br>
a message format according to an embodiment of the present invention. Here, Fig. 13<br>
illustrates examples in which what meaning respective values recorded on the MDESC<br>
field have in the case where the MDESC is expressed by 1 byte. A message type, an<br>
NAD, length data, a flag, and a reserved for future use (RFU) are recorded on the<br>
MDESC field. The message type can be expressed by 2 bits, and can express a<br>
command, a response, an event, and data depending on the expressed value. The NAD<br>
can express whether it is a 4-bit NAD or a 8-bit NAD depending on a value thereof.<br><br>
The length data can express a case where length data is absent (no length), a case<br>
where length data is 1 byte long, a case where length data is 2 byte long, and a case<br>
where length data is an RFU. The flag can express a case where following message is<br>
present and a case where no following message is present. The RFU can be always<br>
expressed using a predetermined value.<br>
