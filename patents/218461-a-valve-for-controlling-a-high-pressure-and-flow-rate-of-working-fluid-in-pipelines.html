				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The disadvantage of the abovementioned valve consists in the necessity of applying<br><br>
considerable forces to the closure while opening or closing it, as the forces, applied to the closure, formed working medium pressures in the known design are not balanced. This may also result in-auto-oscillations in the-hydraulic systems, where the known valve is used, occurring in low flow rate operating mode. Such auto-oscillations, manifested by the tapping or humming of the valve may lead to the onset of hydraulic impacts in the system that can destroy the entire system altogether. Technical result, _ achieved with the implementation of the invention consists in the reduction of forces, applied for the movement of the closure and the increase of the valve operational stability as there are no conditions in the hydraulic system, where the valve is used for the onset of auto-oscillations when opening and closing the vaLve. The valve of the claimed_design joins together the advantages of the disc and the slide, yalyes, that is high leakproofness in the closed position is provided together with thehguidatimiof forces, effecting the closure drive at the result of the pressure of the working medium. Besides, due to the presence of the seal assemblies the valve of the claimed design does not require any advanced quality of parts treatment to provide normal operation, as its leakproofness in the closed position is provided by the grinding in of the valve seat to the lower edge of the closure.  The claimed technical result is achieved by means of the valve, comprising a body<br>
provided with inlet and outlet holes, a valve seat, a closure, connected to a drive and seal assemblies, where the body comprises rigidly connected to said body cylindrical insert with the drain port and the closure is embodied in the form of a hollow sleeve which consists of two conjugated cylindrical parts'one'of each has external diameter approximately equal to internal diameter of the second part, a closure executed with the possibility of reciprocal movement along the cylindrical insert external surface.<br><br>
Connected to the driving means cylindrical part of the closure manly located located<br>
in the female seal assembly, whereas the male seal assembly is located inside the<br>
second cylindrical part.<br>
The drive provides for the axial movement of the closure, whereas its lower face,<br>
contacting the valve seat is embodied in the form of the inverse truncated cone.<br>
The lower cylindrical part of the hollow sleeve may have the internal diameter<br>
constituting 0.9-1.1 of the external diameter of it's upper cylindrical part.<br>
Due to the closure is embodied in the form of a hollow sleeve which consists of two<br>
conjugated cylindrical partsone of-each has external diameter-approximately equal to<br>
internal diaineter of the second part, the longitudinal forces, induced by the pressure<br>
the working medium, e.g. fluid or gas, effecting the upper portion of the cylindrical<br>
' part's external surface and the lower (face) portion of said cylindrical part balance each other, providing the valve's leakproofness and reducing the effort, necessary^fof moving the closure.<br><br>
Figure presents a general view of the valve of the claimed design.<br>
The valve comprises the body 1 with the inlet 2 and outlet 3 holes, with the hole 3<br>
provided in the lower part of the body. The mention of the hole 3 in the lower part of<br>
the body is conditional and is made so as to simplify the description of the valve parts<br>
positional relationships. Actually the valve is operational irrespective of its position in<br>
space.<br>
The valve closure is embodied in the form of the hollow sleeve 4, comprising a<br>
cylindrical part 5, contacting the body and coupled with the cylindrical part 6,<br>
contacting the insert and having the internal diameter near equal to the external<br>
diameter of the cylindrical part 5. To ensure normal operation of the valve, the<br>
internal diameter of the cylindrical part 6     must be equal to the external diameter of<br><br>
the part 5. It is preferable to have these diameters strictly equal, but in some cases this<br>
requirement can considerably heighten the cost of the finished product. The cylindrical part 5 is located in the female seal assembly 7, whereas the ring seal assembly 8 is located inside the cylindrical part 6. The cylindrical part 5 is connected to the drive, facilitating the axial movement of the closure.<br>
The drive can be embodied for instance in the form of the screw 9, with its inner thread corresponding to the inner thread, made on the internal surface of the sleeve 4. The screw is set in motion by the flywheel 10, whereas the sleeve is locked in the position with the help of conventional means, e.g. with the help of a pin, attached to the sleeve, said pin moving in the notch of the nut, fixed on the body. The valve can _ also be manufactured with electromagnetic or pneumatic No clean    <br>
The external surface of the cylindrical insert 11 serves as a guide for the cylindrical part 6 of the sleeve 4. The valve seat 12 is embodied in the manner so as to provide the contact of the closure lower face surface with the working medium from the side of the inlet hole when the valve is in the closed position. That is, when the valve is in_ the closed position, practically the entire lower face surface of the part 6 of the closure<br>
contacts the working medium with the exception of the internal..portionof-the.lower face surface of the closure lower part, contacting the valve-Seat-12 Preferred is the provision of the closure's lower edge contact with the valve seat on the minimal area.<br>
which can be achieved by way of making said edgeand  seat of hard alloys. Thus the ring contact of the lesser portion of the lower face surface of the closure with the valve seat svirface, enclosing the outlet hole is provided, where the lower face of the closure, contacting the seat, is embodied in the form of the truncated inverted cone. Experiments showed that the valve is operational if the external diameter of the<br><br>
Closure's lower face surface lesser portion comprises not more that 1,1 of the<br>
closure's lower part internal diameter.<br>
The valve seat can have a ring ledge 13 with the external diameter equal to the internal diameter of the cylindrical part 6. Said ring ledge provides additional operational stability and the reduction of longitudinal loads, effecting the valve closure, operating in low working medium flow rate mode, said working medium flowing via the drain hole 14. The valve operates in the following way:<br>
With the valve in the open position the closure 4 is raised in such a way, that the<br>
cylindrical part's 6 external surface upper portion does not contact the valve body<br>
while the longitudinal forces, formed by the pressure of the working medium, e.g.<br>
fluid or gas, effecting the cylindrical part's 6 external surface upper portion and the<br>
lower face portion of said part balance each other, therefore no forces from the drive<br>
are required to fix the sleeve 4 in position. Besides, the claimed position facilitates a<br>
free flow of working medium between the inlet and outlet holes, i.e. the lower edge of<br>
the sleeve 4 must be located above the upper limit of the drain hole 14.<br>
When closing the valve, the drive provides for the down movement of the sleeve 4,<br>
	when, as it was described above, no radial force is formed,, therefore the Power<br><br><br><br>
developed by the drive is spent to overcome the friction forces between the sleeve 4<br>
and the seal assemblies. The sleeve 4 down movement provides a gradual closing of the drain hole 14 by the lower cylindrical part 6 and reduces the valve open flow area.<br>
Further, when the lower edge of the lower cylindrical part 6 passes the upper limit of the cylindrical ledge 13 of the valve seat, there occurs nearly complete stoppage of the working medium flow. If the valve is manufactured without a cylindrical ledge on the<br><br>
valve seat and also to increase the leakproofness of the valve, having said ledge, the<br><br><br>
Sleeve 4 is moved down till its lower edge contacts the valve seat, which results in the<br>
complete stoppage of the working medium flow. As the lower face portion of the<br>
lower<br>
cylindrical part 6 contacts the surface of valve seat on a relatively insignificant area,<br>
the longitudinal force, induced by the pressure of the working medium has practically<br>
no effect on the sleeve 4 when the valve is in the closed position. Therefore the<br>
closure does not require the application of the longitudinal force to keep the valve in<br>
the closed position. Besides, the effort to open the valve is spent to overcome the<br>
friction forces only.<br>
An important characteristic of the valve of the design, facilitating the balancing of the<br>
,	closure is the independeape of the power, required to close the valve with the<br>
f Specified speed/from the pressure of the working medium. This provides for the stable<br><br>
	operaiion of the valve in the working medium of any pressure, which constitutes an<br>
	essential advantage of the claimed valve, as compared to the valves of other known<br><br>
	designs.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
