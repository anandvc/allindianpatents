				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an integrated type air<br>
conditioner.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
On a room interior side of a conventional integrated type<br>
air conditioner, an interior heat exchanger is disposed<br>
centrally of a front face of the unit and a centrifugal fan<br>
such as Sirocco fan or turbofan is disposed downstream of the<br>
interior heat exchanger, and blow-out ports are disposed on<br>
both sides of the interior heat exchanger. More particularly,<br>
as described in Patent Literatures 1 and 2, an air suction port<br>
is disposed on the front side of the integrated type air<br>
conditioner so as to be opposed to the interior heat exchanger,<br>
and air sucked in from the air suction port is sucked into the<br>
centrifugal fan through the interior heat exchanger, then passes<br>
through an air path, and is blown out from air blow-out ports<br>
formed on both sides of the air suction port.<br>
[Patent Literature 1]<br>
Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open No. S53(1978)-157549<br>
[Patent Literature 2]<br>
Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. Hll(1999)-325505<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the above conventional integrated type air conditioner,<br>
despite the unit width cannot be made large and is originally<br>
narrow, a square air suction port is disposed on a front side<br>
when seen from the interior of a room and vertically long,<br>
rectangular air blow-out ports are disposed on the right and<br>
left sides of the air suction port. Therefore, in order to<br>
obtain a predetermined air volume for ensuring a required heat<br>
exchange quantity, it has been necessary to use a high-pressure<br>
fan (Sirocco fan) because the pressure loss of the heat exchanger<br>
is larger. As a result, there arise problems. For example,<br>
the noise of the fan is high and the input of a fan motor is<br>
high, with consequent increase of unit power consumption and<br>
deteriorated COP (coefficient of output performance =<br>
capacity/electric input).<br>
This is for the following reason. As a room fan there<br>
is used a multiblade fan of a large inside diameter wherein<br>
blades capable of outputting high air volume and high pressure<br>
are inclined largely in a rotational direction, so that the<br>
blow-out speed at a fan outlet is high and the loss at blow-out<br>
ports becomes large. The blow-out ports disposed on both sides<br>
of the front face of the unit cannot be made small. Consequently,<br>
the width of the interior heat exchanger cannot be made large<br>
inevitably.<br>
This problem has led to further problems. For example.<br>
since the air blow-out speed in the blow-out ports is low, cold<br>
air does not spread throughout the whole of the room, with<br>
consequent unevenness in room temperature and prolonged time<br>
until reaching a predetermined temperature.<br>
More particularly, when the width of the interior heat<br>
exchanger is increased in order to improve the heat exchanging<br>
performance of the interior heat exchanger, the width of each<br>
air blow-out port is reduced, resulting in an increase of noise,<br>
while when the width of each air blow-out port is increased<br>
for the purpose of reducing noise, the width of the interior<br>
heat exchanger becomes smaller, with consequent deterioration<br>
of its heat exchanging performance.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide an<br>
integrated type air conditioner having an air suction port formed<br>
in a front face of the unit and air blow-out ports formed on<br>
the right and left sides of the air suction port, the air<br>
conditioner being capable of reducing noise and attaining a<br>
satisfactory heat exchanging performance which are<br>
antagonistic phenomena.<br>
The above object is achieved by an integrated type air<br>
conditioner comprising a compressor installed within a unit,<br>
an exterior heat exchanger, an interior heat exchanger, an<br>
exterior fan, an air suction port formed in a front face of<br>
the unit, and air blow-out ports formed on the right and left<br>
sides by the air suction port, wherein the interior heat<br>
exchanger is disposed in opposition to the air suction port<br>
and has U bends at both ends thereof and also has fins at the<br>
portion located between the U bends, and the ratio of the width<br>
of the fin portion of the interior heat exchanger to the width<br>
of the unit is in the range of 0.60 to 0.75.<br>
The above object is also achieved by an integrated type<br>
air conditioner comprising a compressor installed within the<br>
unit, an exterior heat exchanger, an interior heat exchanger,<br>
an exterior fan, an air suction port formed in a front face<br>
of the unit, and air blow-out ports formed on the right and<br>
left sides by the air suction port, wherein the interior heat<br>
exchanger is disposed in opposition to the air suction port<br>
and has U bends at both ends thereof and also has fins at the<br>
portion located between the U bends, and the ratio of the overall<br>
width of the interior heat exchanger to the width of the unit<br>
is in the range of 0.70 to 0.85.<br>
According to the present invention it is possible to<br>
provide an integrated type air conditioner comprising an air<br>
suction port formed in a front face of a unit and air blow-out<br>
ports formed on the right and left sides of the air suction<br>
port, the air conditioner permitting both reduction of noise<br>
and the attainment of a satisfactory heat exchanging<br>
performance.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIEMNT<br>
FIG. 1 shows an integrated type air conditioner according<br>
to an embodiment of the present invention. The numeral 1 denotes<br>
a unit base on which components of the integrated type air<br>
conditioner are mounted. Those components are covered with<br>
a cabinet 2. An exterior partition wall 6 serves as a partition<br>
between a discharge space and a suction space, and a mouth ring<br>
3 for exterior use is provided as a suction port in the exterior<br>
partition wall 6. The discharge space is enclosed with the<br>
exterior partition wall 6 and an exterior heat exchanger 5,<br>
and air fed from an exterior fan 4 disposed downstream of the<br>
mouth ring 3 is discharged to the discharge space. A compressor<br>
8, a suction tank 7, and a fan motor 11 for driving the exterior<br>
fan 4 and an interior fan 12 through two shafts, are disposed<br>
upstream of the exterior fan 4. The fan motor 11 is fixed to<br>
the unit base 1 through a fan motor support base 10. When the<br>
exterior fan 4 rotates, air is sucked into the air conditioner<br>
from a room in which the compressor 8 is installed, then passes<br>
through the exterior heat exchanger 5 installed downstream of<br>
the exterior fan 4, whereby heat is released to the exterior<br>
of the room.<br>
A front grille 19, a filter 15 and an interior heat<br>
exchanger 21 are disposed on the room side of an interior/<br>
exterior partition wall 9. A suction casing 20 is provided<br>
which also serves as apart of an interior casing 17 for conducting<br>
air from the interior heat exchanger 21 to the interior fan<br>
12. Air sucked in from the interior mouth ring 13 enters the<br>
interior fan 12 and the flow of air from the fan 12 is divided<br>
to both sides of the unit by noses 22. Further, lateral wind<br>
direction adjusting plates 16 and vertical wind direction<br>
adjusting plates 18 are mounted downstream of the noses 22.<br>
Upon rotation of the interior fan, air is sucked in<br>
through the front grille 19 and the filter 15, absorbs heat<br>
in the interior heat exchanger 21, then is divided by the plural<br>
noses 22 and the interior casing 17 which determine a blow-out<br>
air flow on the downstream side of the fan, and cold air is<br>
discharged to the interior of the room from blow-out ports 14<br>
disposed on both sides of the interior heat exchanger 21. The<br>
interior heat exchanger 21 comprises a central fin portion which<br>
mainly performs heat exchange, a refrigerant flowing pipe, and<br>
U-bend portions 23 for return of the pipe on both sides of the<br>
fin portion. The width of the fin portion is assumed to be<br>
Wexf and the overall width of both fin portion and U bend portions<br>
is assumed to be Wex. In the integrated type air conditioner,<br>
air sucked in from the air suction port formed in the front<br>
face on the room side is heat-exchanged through the width Wexf<br>
of the fin portion out of the overall width Wex of the interior<br>
heat exchanger 21 and is sucked into the interior fan 12. The<br>
thus-conditioned air is blown of f into the room from the blow-out<br>
ports 14 formed on both outer sides of the interior heat exchanger<br>
21 and on both sides of the air suction port which is formed<br>
in the front face of the unit.<br>
Though not shown, a drain pan for receiving condensate<br>
and a water conduit for conducting water from the drain pan<br>
to an exterior lower portion of the unit 1 are provided under<br>
the interior heat exchanger 21.<br>
As described above, the interior heat exchanger is made<br>
up of fins, a pipe which is in close contact with the fins,<br>
and both-end U bends for multi-return of the pipe. Thus, the<br>
fin portion sandwiched in between the both-end U bends<br>
substantially functions as a heat exchange portion, while the<br>
U bend portions at both ends scarcely contribute to heat exchange<br>
in comparison with the fin portion. In many integrated type<br>
air conditioners, the unit width is 470 mm to 660 mm (depending<br>
on cooling capacity) , the width of the fin portion in the interior<br>
heat exchanger is 270 mm in the former, 375 mm in the latter.<br>
and the ratio of a substantial heat exchanging portion to the<br>
unit width is about 0.57.<br>
The overall width of the interior heat exchanger as a<br>
total of the width of the fin portion and the total length of<br>
both-side U bends was about 330 mm in the former, 435 mm in<br>
the latter, (0.7 to 0.66 as the ratio to the unit width).<br>
This value has been determined taking into account the<br>
demand for ensuring a sufficient heat exchange quantity by<br>
increasing the front mounting area of the interior heat exchanger<br>
and the fear of eventual increase of noise and of power<br>
consumption caused by an increase of fan input which are<br>
attributable to an increase of the front area of the heat<br>
exchanger in the width direction with consequent narrowing of<br>
blow-out ports on the both sides of the unit and consequent<br>
rapid increase of the blow-out speed leading to a greater<br>
increase of fan pressure than necessary.<br>
However, this structure has involved the following<br>
problems. Despite the original small unit width, the front<br>
area of the fin portion in the interior heat exchanger is as<br>
small as 0 . 57 as referred to above, so that when a predetermined<br>
air volume for ensuring a required heat exchange quantity is<br>
provided, a large pressure loss of the heat exchanger results<br>
and therefore it is inevitably required to use a high-pressure<br>
fan (Sirocco fan). As a result, there arise the problem that<br>
the noise of the fan is loud and the problem that the input<br>
of the fan motor is high, with consequent increase in power<br>
consumption of the unit and deterioration of COP.<br>
FIG. 2 is a front view of the air conditioner of this<br>
embodiment, showing the unit width Wu versus the widths Wexf<br>
and Wex of the heat exchanger, an outlet width Bd of each blow-out<br>
port and the vertical direction of the unit. In this embodiment,<br>
an electric part 24 for operating the unit is disposed in the<br>
lower portion of the unit. The unit is formed in a rectangular<br>
shape having a width Wu and a height Hu. Likewise, the heat<br>
exchanger is formed in a rectangular shape having widths Wexf,<br>
Wex and a height Hex, and each blow-out port is formed in a<br>
rectangular shape having a width Bd and a height Hd.<br>
Therefore, it is necessary that the balance between the<br>
pressure loss of the heat exchanger and the pressure loss<br>
(dynamic pressure for blow-out of air) of the blow-out ports<br>
be determined taking characteristics of the fan into account.<br>
That is, when the widths Wexf and Wex of the interior heat<br>
exchanger 21 are set large to increase the heat exchange quantity,<br>
the blow-out speed of air from the blow-out ports 14 increases<br>
and a dynamic pressure thereof increases rapidly, with the result<br>
that a higher pressure than the pressure rising level of the<br>
fan is needed and hence air does not flow.<br>
When the outlet width Bd of each blow-out port 14 is<br>
increased for decreasing the dynamic pressure of the blow-out<br>
port 14 and for diminishing the loss of each wind direction<br>
adjusting plate 18, the width of the interior heat exchanger<br>
21 becomes smaller, thus giving rise to the problem that not<br>
only the pressure loss of the heat exchanger increases but also<br>
it is impossible to ensure the required heat exchange quantity.<br>
Moreover, for ensuring a sufficient air volume it is<br>
necessary to increase the number of revolutions of the fan,<br>
which leads to a great increase of noise and hence to a rapid<br>
increase of the fan motor input, with consequent increase of<br>
power consumption. This is undesirable from the standpoint<br>
of power saving.<br>
That is , in the integrated type air conditioner, an optimum<br>
value which permits maximizing the air volume and maximizing<br>
the heat exchange quantity is present between the width Wexf<br>
or Wex of the interior heat exchanger 21 and the blow-out port<br>
width.<br>
FIG. 3 shows an effect obtained in this embodiment, more<br>
particularly, shows how the energy consumption efficiency<br>
(generally called COP) relative to the unit capacity is changed<br>
by varying fin portion widths (Wexf) relative to the unit width<br>
(Wu) and by consequent changes in air volume while adopting<br>
a conventional value as unit noise (the values described in<br>
the figure are of 1. 5 HP and higher models , assuming the capacity<br>
to be constant) . More particularly, the numerical values were<br>
calculated by experiment and simulation. The conventional<br>
maximum value of the fin portion width in the heat exchanger<br>
is about Wexf/Wu =0.57 and COP at this point is shown as COP<br>
= 1.0.<br>
As the fan there is used a centrifugal fan (turbofan) which<br>
is lower in absolute speed of the impeller outlet (impeller<br>
outlet angle is approximately within |32 = 130) in comparison<br>
with Sirocco fan.<br>
Consequently, the capacity is improved to a great extent<br>
at a heat exchanger width of Wexf/Wu = 0.60 or more which is<br>
larger than the conventional maximum value, and lowers rapidly<br>
at a Wexf/Wu value of 0.75 or more. The reason for such a rapid<br>
drop in capacity at Wexf/Wu of 0.75 or more is that the blow-out<br>
ports become relatively narrow with an increase of Wexf/Wu and<br>
a consequent increase of the blown-off air velocity leads to<br>
an increase of dynamic pressure and of loss at the wind direction<br>
adjusting plates. Theoretically, at Wexf/Wu = 1.0, there is<br>
neither blow-out area nor air volume, so that COP becomes equal<br>
to zero.<br>
When the Wexf/Wu value is small, there occur a decrease<br>
of the heat transfer area of the heat exchanger and a sudden<br>
increase of pressure loss of the heat exchanger, with consequent<br>
deterioration of capacity and a great increase of the fan motor<br>
input. At Wexf = 0 , the air volume becomes zero, thus resulting<br>
in COP becoming zero.<br>
From the above it is seen that, for ensuring a larger<br>
value than the conventional COP ratio of 1, the fin portion<br>
width (Wexf) of the heat exchanger relative to the unit width<br>
(Wu) should be in the range of Wexf/Wu = 0.60 to 0.75.<br>
In the air conditioner, it is important to improve 1%<br>
or more of COP. Besides, since the improvement of COP being<br>
considered is based on only the fan performance and the state<br>
of mounting of the heat exchanger, the above results which do<br>
not lead to a large increase of cost are important for power<br>
saving. In this sense, an optimum Wexf/Wu value permitting<br>
1% or more improvement of COP relative to the value available<br>
at present may be set at 0.625 to 0.7. Further, it may be<br>
considered that an ultimate optimum value is in the range from<br>
0.65 to 0.7.<br>
Since the above effects can be obtained on the basis of<br>
only the heat transfer area of the heat exchanger and the air<br>
volume of the fan under a constant noise level, any factor leading<br>
to a great increase of cost is constituted and it is possible<br>
to shorten the period for development.<br>
Thus, in the integrated type air conditioner, setting<br>
the fin portion width (Wexf) of the heat exchanger to a value<br>
in the range of 0.60 to 0.75 relative to the unit width or to<br>
a value in such a more suitable range as described above is<br>
advantageous in the aspect of noise and the aspect of unit cycle<br>
efficiency. Further, since the blow-out port width (Bd) can<br>
be made smaller than in the prior art, the blown-off air velocity<br>
increases and cold air spreads throughout the whole of the room.<br>
with consequent improvement of comfortableness.<br>
In the integrated type air conditioner of this embodiment,<br>
as described above, since the mounting width of the heat<br>
exchanger within the limited unit width is made 10% or more<br>
larger than in the prior art by optimization in relation to<br>
the dynamic pressure at the outlet of each blow-out port, it<br>
is possible to attain a high air volume under the same noise<br>
level condition to increase the interior heat exchange quantity<br>
and thereby possible to decrease the power consumption to a<br>
low level. Further, by narrowing the outlet width of each<br>
blow-out port as a result of the above, the air blow-out velocity<br>
is increased to let cold air spread throughout the whole of<br>
the room and the room temperature can be brought to a<br>
predetermined level after the start of operation. As a result,<br>
it is possible to prevent the occurrence of unevenness in<br>
temperature throughout the whole of the room.<br>
Thus, the optimum value of the fin portion width (Wexf)<br>
in the heat exchanger has been shown above, but in the actual<br>
heat exchanger, as shown in FIG. 1, the U bend pipe portions<br>
23 are located on both sides of the fin portion and the U bends<br>
scarcely exhibit any heat exchanging effect, but are important<br>
portions for mounting the heat exchanger. The blow-out port<br>
width (Bd) depends on the fin portion width (Wexf) plus the<br>
width (Bd) of the U bends on both sides. According to the<br>
foregoing actual numerical values, the U bend width is about<br>
22% to 16% of the find portion width (Wexf) , 13% to 9% of the<br>
unit width.<br>
Consequently, an optimum value of the overall heat exchanger<br>
width (Wex) is Wex/Wu = 0.70 to 0.85, which is a little higher<br>
than the above optimum value. It follows that, when the axis<br>
of abscissa in FIG. 3 is considered as the overall heat exchanger<br>
width, the width ratio which permits a more improvement of the<br>
heat exchange quantity than in the conventional range can be<br>
considered as Wex/Wu = 0.70 to 0.85.<br>
Also as to the optimum value of the overall heat exchanger<br>
width including the U bends, it is apparent that there exists<br>
an optimum range affording a higher energy consumption<br>
efficiency (COP) as in the optimum value of the fin portion<br>
width (Wexf) in the heat exchanger.<br>
By setting the heat exchanger width relative to the unit<br>
width at a value falling under the optimum range, the air velocity<br>
of the blow-out ports increases, whereby the room temperature<br>
distribution can be made uniform and it is possible to shorten<br>
the time required for reaching a predetermined temperature.<br>
This embodiment is for further enhancing this effect.<br>
According to the conventional structure, blow-out ports<br>
are located on the front side of the unit and cold air is blown<br>
off to the front side of the unit. On the other hand, according<br>
to a modification of blow-out ports shown in FIG. 4, blow-out<br>
ports 14 are enlarged sideways of the unit. With a swing motion<br>
of wind direction adjusting plates 18, cold air is blown off<br>
along both side faces of the unit. When the blow-out ports<br>
14 are thus enlarged along both side faces of the unit, the<br>
air velocity in the blow-out ports 14 is mitigated and the<br>
capacity can be improved by a still further increase of air<br>
volume. Since the front decorative frame portion is curved,<br>
it is preferable that the size (Dd) of the enlargement be set<br>
at 20% or more of the blow-out port width (Bd).<br>
As a result, the following effect is obtained in connection<br>
with the room temperature distribution. When the blow-out<br>
ports are enlarged sideways of the unit and cold air is blown<br>
off along both side faces through wind direction adjusting plates ,<br>
the whole or walls of the room can be cooled with cold air without<br>
increase of loss at the wind direction adjusting plates because<br>
the blow-out ports are larger than in the prior art, whereby<br>
a panel cooling effect is created in a steady state.<br>
A description will now be given about the shape of the<br>
interior fan 12 with reference to FIG. 1. In the interior fan<br>
12, the outside diameter of a shroud 26 is smaller than the<br>
inside diameter of a hub 25, and the outside diameter of each<br>
blade 24 is made smaller gradually from the hub 25 side toward<br>
the shroud 26. A fan motor input can be decreased by 10% or<br>
more in comparison with the case where the diameter of the blade<br>
2 4 is constant axially. By adopting this mounting form of the<br>
interior heat exchanger and example of blow-out ports , the energy<br>
consumption efficiency (COP) shown in FIG. 3 is further improved.<br>
Although reference has been made to the integrated type<br>
air conditioner having blow-out ports on both right and left<br>
sides of the interior heat exchanger, the same effects as above<br>
can also be obtained even when there are other blow-out ports<br>
than those both-side blow-out ports.<br>
Thus, according to the above embodiment, since the heat<br>
exchanger mounting area can be set to a maximum within the limited<br>
unit width, it is possible to decrease the power consumption,<br>
increase the air volume and consequent improvement of cool<br>
feeling, assuming that the capacity is constant. Moreover,<br>
since the fan motor input decreases, it is possible to minimize<br>
the consumption of resources and reduce the cost and weight.<br>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:<br>
1. An integrated type air conditioner comprising a<br>
compressor installed within the unit, an exterior heat exchanger,<br>
an interior heat exchanger, an exterior fan, an interior fan,<br>
an air suction port formed in a front face of the unit, and<br>
air blow-out ports formed on the right and left sides by the<br>
air suction port, wherein the interior heat exchanger is disposed<br>
in opposition to the air suction port and has U bends at both<br>
ends thereof and also has fins at the portion located between<br>
the U bends, and the ratio of the width of the fin portion of<br>
the interior heat exchanger to the width of the unit is in the<br>
range of 0.60 to 0.75.<br>
2. The integrated type air conditioner according to claim<br>
1, wherein the air blow-out ports are enlarged sideways of the<br>
unit.<br>
3. An integrated type air conditioner comprising a<br>
compressor installed within the unit, an exterior heat exchanger,<br>
an interior heat exchanger, an exterior fan, an interior fan,<br>
an air suction port formed in a front face of the unit, and<br>
air blow-out ports formed on the right and left sides by the<br>
air suction port, wherein the interior heat exchanger is disposed<br>
in opposition to the air suction port and has U bends at both<br>
ends thereof and also has fins at the portion located between<br>
the U bends, and the ratio of the overall width of the interior<br>
heat exchanger to the width of the unit is in the range of 0.70<br>
to 0.85.<br>
4. The integrated type air conditioner according to claim<br>
3, wherein the air blow-out ports are enlarged sideways of the<br>
unit.<br><br>
In an integrated type air conditioner wherein air suction<br>
port is formed in a room-side front face of the unit and air<br>
blow-out ports are formed on both sides of the air suction port,<br>
when the blow-out ports are narrowed, the air blow-out velocity<br>
increases, with consequent increase of pressure and noise, while<br>
when the blow-out port s are widened, the width of a heat exchanger<br>
becomes narrow and the cycle capacity is deteriorated. To avoid<br>
this problem, the width of the heat exchanger to the unit width<br>
in the integrated type air conditioner is set at a value in<br>
the range of 0.6 to 0.75.<br></td>
