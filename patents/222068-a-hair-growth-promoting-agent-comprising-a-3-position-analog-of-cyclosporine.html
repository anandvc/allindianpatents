				<td>USE OF 3-POSITION CYCLOSPORIN DERTVATI\"ES FOR HAIR GROWTH<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a hair growth promoting agent comprising a cyclosporin derivative as an active ingredient and more particularly, to a hair growth promoting agent comprising cyclosporin derivatives modified in the 3-position as an active ingredient.<br>
Background Art<br>
On average, the human scalp contains about 100,000 to 150,000 hairs. Each hair has three main stages of growth: anagen, catagen and telogen, after which the hair falls out. This hair growth cycle is repetitive and the duration of one cycle is different from other cycles, ranging approximately 3 to 6 years. Thus, the average adult normally loses about 50 to 100 hairs every day. In general, alopecia refers to a phenomenon wherein duration of the anagen growth phase is shortened and the percentage of hairs in the catagen and telogen phases increases, whereby the number of lost hairs is increased excessively and abnormally.<br>
There are many theories to explain for loss of hair, including for example, poor blood circulation, excessive functioning of male sex hormone, excessive production and secretion of sebum, deterioration of scalp by peroxides, bacteria, etc., hereditary factors, aging, stress, etc. However, explicit mechanisms have not been revealed. Recently, the population suffering from hair loss is tending to increase, since changing dietary habits and stress imposed on individuals due to modern social environments, etc. has increased. Also, the age of the individuals affected by alopecia is dropping and furthermore, the population of female alopecia sufferers is rising.<br>
One of preparations which are most commonly used for treatment and<br>
M*<br>
prevention of alopecia*is one that contains minoxidil. There are two hair-regrowth agents which have received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and minoxidil is one of those approved hair-regrowth agents. Minoxidil was originally developed as a hypertension drug for the purpose of reducing blood pressure. However, when using this drug, as a side effect, a trichogenous effect<br><br>
was observed and thereafter, this drug became famous as a hair-regrowth agent. Although mechanisms by which minoxidil works as a hr.r-regrowth asent is no: clearly understood, it is inferred that minoxidil increases blood flow by expansion of blood vessels, whereby roots of hairs are supplied with more nutrition and eventually, growth of hairs are promoted,<br>
Such a model of bicod flow increase has been indirectly supported by a recent report that minoxidil enhances the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a growth factor associated with vasodiiata:ion in the dermal papilla which is a main cell making up the hair roots. Also, other than the vasodilative effect of the minoxidil in the hair-restoring mechanism, it has been reported that minoxidil promotes activation of dermal papilla cells in the roots of hair incubated in vitro, and growth of hair follicles in a tissue culture of follicles in vitro. These facts indicate that minoxidii may work directly on the roots of hair as a growth factor.<br>
In addition, finasteride, a main component of Propecia which has started to be sold by Merck, is used for treatment of alopecia. It inhibits conversion of the male hormone testosterone into dihydrotestosterone, which is a more potent male hormone than testosterone, On December of 1997, the 1 mg finasteride tablet was approved by the US FDA as a hair-regrowth agent for treatment of male pattern hair loss in men only, and is now commercially available. In clinical studies, it has been demonstrated to have a significant trichogenous effect. However, there has been a report that finasteride may inhibit male sexual function as a side effect. Since neither finasteride nor minoxidil show superior effect in clinical tests, and there is concern about side effects, many researches are conducted to develop a new and improved hair-regrowth agents.<br>
The cyclosporin family of drugs has immunosuppressive activity. It is also effective to inhibit growth of virus, fungus, protozoan, etc. and has various physiological effects such as nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, hypertension, enlargement of periodontium, trichogenous effect, and so on, as side effects. Cyclosporin A, a representative cyclosporin, is a cyclic peptide having the following Chemical Formula, "which comprises 11 amino acids, including several N-methyl araino acids and D-alanine at No. 8 residue.<br><br>
[Structure Formula 1]<br>
pMeBmt-Abu-Sar-MeLeu—Val-MeLeu-Aia-DA!a-MeLeu —MeLeu—<br>
1	23	4	5,6	78	5	10	11<br>
where MeBmt is N-raethyl-(4R)-4-"k(E)-2-biitenyrj-4-methyl-L--Jireonhe, Abu is L-a-aminobutyric acid, Sar is sarco sine, MeLeu is N-methyl-L-leucir.e,Val is L-valine, Ala is L-alanine, DAla is D-alanine, MeVal is N-raethyl-L-valine.<br>
The amino acid form of cyclosporin A of the above Chemical Formula 1 is L-configuration, unless otherwise specified. The residue numbering of amino acids starts from MeBmt and proceeds clockwise, i.e. 1 for MeBmt and 11 for the last MeVal (N-methyl-L-valine) as shown in the Structure Formula 1. Nomenclature of '.•arious derivatives including cyclosporins A to Z, follows methods commonly used (Helv. Chim. Acta, 1987, 70:13-36). For example, if Abu in the 2-position of cyclosporin A is substituted with L-alanine, L-threonine, L-valine or L-norvaline, the derivatives thus prepared are named cyclosporin B, cyclosporin C, cyclosporin D or cyclosporin G, respectively. Further, when the amino acid residues of the cyclosporin derivatives differ from those of cydcsporin A, the derivatives are named by describing the substituent For example, if sarcosine, being the amino acid residue 3 of cyclosporin A, is substituted with N-methyl-D-Abu3 or N-methyl-D-Nva3, the derivatives thus prepared are named [N-methyl-D-Abu3] cyclosporin A or [N-methyl-D-Nva3] cyclosporin A, respectively. Meanwhile, a common method for abbreviating amino acids is employed, that is, N-methyl-L-leucine is abbreviated by MeLeu, N-methyl-L-isoleucine by MeUe, N-methyl-L-Valine by MeVal, N-methyl-L-alanine by MeAla, N-rr.ethyl-L-norvaline by MeNva, L-leucine by Leu, L-isoleucine by He, sarcosine by Sar, L-serine by Ser, L-valine, Val, L-alanine by Ala, D-alanine by DAla, L-aminobutviic acid by Abu, L-threonine by Thr, and L-norvaline by Nva. Further, as for a derivative of cyclosporin which is substituted with sulfur instead of a carbonyl oxygen at the amino acid residue 7, the name of the derivative may be cyclosporin 7-thioamide or [V CS-NH] cyclosporin, according to different references (Helv. Chint Acta. 74: 1953-1990,1991; J. Org, Chem. 58:673-677,1993; J. Org. Chem. 59:7249-7258,1994).<br>
So far, possible development of cyclosporin as a hair-regrowth agent has been studied by many research grouris. Particularly, researches involving animal hair reg^&gt;wth tests, human alopecia artata (J. Am Acad. DerrnaioL, 1990,22^42-250), human male pattern alopecia (J. Am, Acad, DennatoL, 1990,22^51-253 and Skm PhanracoL, 1994,7:101-104), and inhibition effect of hair toss by chenwtherapy in animal models (Am. J. PathoL, 1997,150:1433-1441) have been widely conducted In comparative exrwimenrs on mouse's back, h is shown that cyclosporin has a hair regrowrh effect about 100 times superior to minoxidn Based on such<br><br>
findings, there have been attempts to utilize cyclosporin as a treatment for male pattern alopecia, and many applications for patents have been filed<br>
For example, Japanese Patent Publication Kokai Nos. Sho 60-243008, Sho 62-19512. and Sho 62-19513 disclose use of cyclosporin derivatives as a hair regrowth agent Also, Europe Patent Publication No. 0414632B1 teaches a cyclosporin derivative modified ir. the 8-position, and PCT Publication No. 93/1 7039 teaches isocyclosporin. Moreover, United States Patent No. 5,807,820 and British Patent No. 2,218,334A disclose cyclosporins with excellent transdermal absorption, pursuant to the use of cyclosporins as hair restorers.<br>

Female C57BL/6 mice of ages 6 to 7 weeks were utilized. After removing hairs or. the middle of the back with an electric shaver, the mice were weighed and randomly assigned to the test groups with an even distribution of weights. The mice were given one day for adaptation. From the next day, mice were applied once a day on their backs with cyclosporir. A and the cyclosporin A derivatives (Compounds 1 to 7) prepared by HPLC in Example 1 in amounts of 100 ul (cone. 0.1% w/v) for 30 days. "Hie results were determined by visual approach, in terms of degrees of hair regrowth. With respect to respective hair-removed .areas, rates of new hair growth were examined and compared.<br>
As can be seen in Table 29, cyclosporin derivatives of the Invention have a significant hair growth promoting effect, compared to the control in which mice were applied with a vehicle only. Further, the derivatives show a similar level of hair growth promoting effect, with respect to cyclosporin A Meanwhile, over a course of 30 days, as comparing the appearance of the backs, the mice of the control and all test groups showed no specific skin irritation.<br>
