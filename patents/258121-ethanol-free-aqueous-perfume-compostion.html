ETHANOL-FREE AQUEOUS PERFUME COMPOSITION<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a transparent, ethanol-free perfumed aqueous microemulsion composition, such as fragrances, Eaux de Toilettes, body sprays, body deodorants, refreshing and cleaning wet towels, aqueous cosmetic compositions, household cleaners, and air fresheners.<br>
hi the perfume industry there has been a long standing need for ethanol-free aqueous perfume compositions. It is well known to produce cosmetic compositions containing ethanol, by the consumers often designated as "alcohol". Such ethanol-containing cosmetics are not acceptable for various reasons such as skin sensitivity, infant safety, and religious prohibition of use of ethanol for some consumers. Also, there is an ongoing trend to reduce the use of volatile organic chemicals (VOC). Aqueous compositions, on the other hand, have the benefits that water is environmentally friendly and the formulations are nonflammable. The perfume industry has attempted to develop ethanol-free compositions to meet the needs of the consumers.<br>
Heretofore, ethanol-free aqueous perfume compositions, the appearance of which can range from that of milk to that of a clear, transparent liquid, generally include the following components: a mixture of natural and/or synthetic fragrance raw materials insoluble in water; an ionic surfactant and/or a non-ionic surfactant; an amphophilic solubilising agent, such as a polyethylene glycol; an aqueous dispersing agent (generally water); and a preservative. The surfactants in the above compositions are generally present in high doses, and are intended, according to their content, to emulsify or to couple the mixture of fragrance materials.<br>
The above known ethanol-free perfume compositions, generally have the following drawbacks: the compositions are not always transparent; the compositions are sticky owing to the sticky nature of the surfactants and to the relatively large quantity of surfactants implemented; the perfume given off by the fragrance material present in the compositions is liable to be denatured by the solubilising agent; the compositions are somewhat irritant owing to the irritant nature of the solubilising agent and the aggressive nature of the<br><br>
surfactants; and the fragrance material present in the compositions are liable to be deteriorated by air oxidation, which detrimentally affects the stability and the olfactory characteristics of the compositions.<br>
An attempt to eliminate the above drawbacks is disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US2003/0186836 Al, published October 2, 2003 wherein an isoprene glycol is used as the microemulsion cosolvent in an ethanol-free perfume composition. The Applicant of the above Patent Application Publication sought to provide a composition with a reduced dose of surfactants that are the origin, in particular, of the sticky and irritant nature of known cosmetic compositions. However, the Applicant was not able to completely eliminate the use of surfactants.<br>
In addition, the composition disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US2003/0186836 has other disadvantages: isoprene glycol is not a very amphiphilic solvent, is a poor coupling agent and is not currently listed as a Cosmetic, Toiletry, &amp; Fragrance Association (CTFC) and The International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients (INCI) acceptable cosmetic ingredient; the composition is limited by the amount of essential oils microemulsified (e.g. 10% by weight maximum); and the composition is limited by a minimum amount of useful surfactant, e.g. 1 wt. % surfactant.<br>
Materials which are previously known and acceptable cosmetic ingredients makes practical the use and acceptance of final formulations containing such materials by cosmetic producers, government agencies and ultimately the consumer. Isoprene glycol has limited acceptance in just a few countries as a cosmetic ingredient.<br>
There is still a need in the cosmetic industry for an ethanol-free aqueous cosmetic composition approved for cosmetic uses that provides efficient, optically clear, non-greasy, non-tacky fragrance microemulsions.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention is directed to an ethanol-free, transparent, perfumed aqueous microemulsion composition comprising: (A) at least one fragrance material, (B) a solvent, wherein said solvent.is a vicinal diol such as 1,2-hexane diol, (C) an aqueous medium, and (D) optionally, one or more surfactants.<br><br>
The ethanol-free, transparent, perfumed aqueous cosmetic microemulsion composition is generally non-greasy and non-sticky. It is particularly useful as a cosmetic, microemulsion composition. The perfumed aqueous cosmetic microemulsion composition of the present invention, previously long-sought after, is now achieveable by using a specific vicinal diol solvent, such as 1,2-hexanediol, in place of known solubilising agents.<br>
The vicinal diol solvent, for example, 1,2-hexanediol, which is amphiphilic, i.e., both hydrophilic and lipophilic, makes it possible, in fact, thanks to its solvent and solubilising power, to substantially reduce the quantity of surfactants used to arrive at a stable composition. This solvent further has characteristics that are absolutely essential in order to obtain a suitable cosmetic.composition. Indeed, the solvent enables translucent compositions to be obtained. In addition, the solvent does not denature the fragrance substance or substances intended for incorporation in said composition in order to obtain a perfumed composition, and the solvent is neither sticky, nor irritant, nor sensitive to air oxidation.<br>
Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
"Ethanol-free" when used herein in reference to a substance means substantially free of ethyl alcohol. "Substantially free" in this context means less than 3 wt %, preferably less than 1 wt %, and more preferably zero weight percent present in a substance.<br>
A "microemulsion" as the term is used herein denotes a pseudo one-phase transparent mixture of (i) two immiscible fluids, and (ii) at least one amphiphile (exemplified by surfactants). Microemulsions are transparent or translucent, and do not display the opalescence of standard emulsions. The particle size of the resulting droplets is small enough so the resulting mixture is optically clear or translucent. Microemulsion droplet sizes are variously defined in the art with a droplet size typically below 0.14 micron. The clarity of these compositions is advantageous in cosmetic applications. Also, microemulsions are thennodynamically stable and form spontaneously.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, the term "optically clear" is used to define a composition that is "transparent" (i.e. transmitting light without distortion) which means that the size of the particles in the composition are reduced to a size where the particles are not observable with optical (visual) means. Transmitting light without distortion as used<br><br>
herein metos being able to read 12-point text through a 1-centimeter thick sample of the microemulsion.<br>
The ethanol-free, perfumed aqueous microemulsion composition of the present invention includes the following components: (A) one or more fragrance raw materials, (B) a solvent, wherein said solvent is a vicinal diol, (C) an aqueous medium, and (D) optionally, one or more surfactants. The present invention may also optionally contain one or more additional ingredients, such as antioxidants, chelating agents, UV filters, preservatives, thickening agents, cosmetic active ingredients, moisturizers, humectants, emollients, opacifiers, pearly gloss impacting substances, pigments, colorants, dyes and antifoams.<br>
The perfumed aqueous microemulsion composition of the present invention includes one or more fragrance materials, Component (A), such as natural and/or synthetic fragrance raw materials. Of particular interest are oil soluble perfume oils, which may or may not he in a mixture with water soluble perfume oils. The oil soluble perfume oils are natural, or nature-identical essential oils, such as orange oil, pine oil, peppermint oil, eucalyptus oil., . lemon oil, clove leaf oil, cedarwood oil, bergamot oil, rosemary oil, patchouli oil, lavandin oil, camomile, jasmine oil, spike oil, rose oil, vetiver oil, fennel oil, anise oil, thyme oil, germanium oil, lavender oil, marjoram or menthol. An animal fragrant, is for example musk, castoreum, aber or zibet. Spagyric essences are also known in the art. They are made by fermenting certain herbs, which were collected while they were flowering, in the presence of water and. yeast, steam distilling off the active ingredients, and concentrating the distilate to the spagyric basic essence. The remaining mash is calcinated, and the basic essence and the calcinated mash are combined to give the final spagyric essence. Synthetic fragrant ingredients are for example synthetic essential oils, such as composed of single compounds, such as linalol, terpineol, nerol, cit-ronelal, benzaldehyde, cinnamon aldehyde, vanillin or methylacetophenone. The fragrance materials may also be synthetic oil-soluble perfume oils, selected from the usual group consisting of fragrant hydrocarbons, alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, ethers, esters, aldehydes, acetals and polyene compounds. Naturally, this term also encompasses any mixture of perfume oils described above, or perfume concentrates or bases with preferably non-ethanolic diluents. Illustrative examples of Component (A) may include commercially available fragrance compositions such as MUSTANG M 0054401, THOMAS M 0054402, BLISS M 0054403, CRACK M 0054404, and CITRUS FUSION M 0054405 (all trade names of V.

Examples of particularly preferred surfactants are ethyloxalated alkanes, fatty acids, fatty acid salts, sulfonates or quaternary ammonium salts, and especially polyoxyethylene fatty ether surfactants, stearic acid and stearic acid salts, most preferably the sodium salt of<br><br>
stearic acid, sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), sodium laureth sulfate (SLES)&gt; lauryl trimethyl ammonium chloride, Brij 30 (trademark of Uniqema, Chemical Abstracts name Poly(oxy-1,2-ethanediyl), alpha-dodecyl-omega-hydroxy- (9CI), Registery Number 9002-92-0), cetyl trimethyl ammonium chloride, or combinations thereof.<br>
The amount of surfactant which may be used in the composition of the present invention is generally from 0 wt % to about 50 wt. %, preferably from 0 wt. % to about 20 wt. %, more preferably from 0 to about 15 wt % and most preferably from 0 to about 10 wt.%; and when the surfactant is present in the composition, the amount of surfactant is preferably from about 0.1 wt. % to about 15 wt. %9 and more preferably from about 0.5 wt. % to about 10 wt.%.<br>
The weight ratio between the fragrance material and the surfactant, if present in the composition of the present invention, generally is from 0.2 : 1 to 10 : 1, preferably from 0. 5 ; 1 to 6 : 1, more preferably from 1 : 1 to 5 : 1, and most preferably from 2 : 1 to 4 : 1.<br>
Other ingredients that may optionally be present in the composition of the present invention may include for example antioxidants, chelating agents, UV filters, and preservatives. Additional ingredients such as thickening agents, cosmetic active ingredients, moisturizers, humectants, emollients, opacifiers, pearly gloss impacting substances, pigments, colorants, dyes and antifoams may also be optionally used in the composition of the present invention.<br>
The optional additional ingredients are generally present in the composition of the present invention from about 0 wt % to about 5 wt %, preferably from about 0.5 wt % to about 3 wt %, and more preferably from about 0.1 wt % to about 1 wt %.<br>
In one illustration of the composition of the present invention, the composition advantageously includes 1,2-hexanediol in a proportion of from about 5 wt % to 30 wt %; a surfactant, wherein the surfactant is preferably a combination of (i) Brij 30 in a proportion of approximately 0.5 wt % to 5.0 wt % and (ii) stearic acid, sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate, cetyl trimethyl ammonium chloride or a stearic acid salt in a proportion of approximately 0.5 wt % to 5.0 wt %; and an essential oil in a proportion of approximately 0,5 wt % to 20 wt %; with the remainder being essentially purified water.<br><br>
All percentages given herein are by the total weight of the perfumed aqueous microemulsion composition.<br>
The microemulsion perfumed aqueous cosmetic composition according to the present invention may be prepared, for example, by simple mixing of all the ingredients; for example by hand stirring or if need be by using a mechanical mixer (i.e. by some mechanically agitating means), the components of the present invention, and any optional components, to form a homogeneous mixture. The components of the present invention may be added together into a suitable reaction vessel and mixed in any order, using conventional processes well known to those skilled in the art. The microemulsion may be produced at room temperature or at an elevated temperature, for example up to 90 °C, preferably up to 55°C can be employed.<br>
The perfume microemulsion compositions of the present invention containing 1,2-hexanediol are uniquely useful. The 1,2-hexanediol as a cosolvent has low odor, pleasant skin feel, and can be formulated as clear stable perfumes with high fiagraace loading, in i      several different product forms.<br>
Because 1,2-hexanediol has very low odor it does not change the olfactory profile of the perfume. This allows perfumers to retain the desired odor profile of fully formulated perfumes.<br>
The 1,2-hexanediol containing perfume microemulsions contain low or no surfactant and as such are pleasant to use with a smooth emollient-like feel without the greasy or tackiness of most presently known perfume microemulsions.<br>
1,2-Hexanediol is known to be an acceptable cosmetic ingredient by CTFC and INCI. The use of 1,2-hexanediol as a microemulsion cosolvent is described in U.S. Patent No. 6,498,197 and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US2004/0077776 Al for silicone microemulsions suitable for cosmetics. Clear hair conditioning microemulsions including 1,2-hexanediol cosolvent are described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US2001/0053374 Al. However, 1,2-hexanediol has never been developed as a cosolvent for a perfume microemulsion, 1,2-hexanediol's unexpected sensory benefits were unknown, and the use of 1,2-hexanediol in surfactant-free compositions were unknown prior to the present invention.<br><br>
Th6 1,2-hexanediol containing perfume microemulsions can be formulated to be optically clear, and stable from about 5 °C to about 55 °C; and to contain a wide variety of fragrance loadings, for example, from about 1 percent by weight to about 30 percent by weight essential oils.<br>
Fragrances, Eaux de Toilettes, aqueous perfumes, body sprays, body deodorants as well as products such as refreshing and cleaning wet towels, aqueous cosmetic compositions, household cleaners, air fresheners and sprayable formulations all require different fragrance loading, and are all easily made using the present invention. A single properly formulated perfume microemulsion containing 1,2-hexanediol maybe diluted for example from about 50 wt %, preferably from about 30 wt % to about 1 wt. % with no loss of stability, i.e. the resulting product is maintained as a microemulsion. Furthermore, perfume microemulsions containing 1,2-hexanediol can be made stable in spite of the addition of other ingredients such as dyes, gelling agents, iridescent material or sparkling materials.<br>
The following examples are given to illustrate the present invention. Because these examples are given for illustrative purposes only, the present invention embodied herein should not be limited thereto.<br>
Examples of perfumed aqueous cosmetic compositions according to the present invention are given below by way of non-limitative illustration. Onless otherwise indicated all parts and percentages are by weight.<br>
