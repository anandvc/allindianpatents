				<td>Description<br><br>
The invention relates to a method for operating a<br>
combined-cycle power plant, in which the heatt cantained<br>
in the expanded working medium of an associated gas<br>
turbine operable with both gas and oil as fuel is<br>
utilized in order to generate steam for an associated<br>
steam turbine comprising at least one high-pressure<br>
stage. It is further directed at a combined-cycle power<br>
plant particularly suitable for carrying out the<br>
method, having a gas turbine operable with both gas and<br>
oil as fuel and having a waste-heat steam generator<br>
following the gas turbine on the flue-gas side and<br>
intended for generating steam for an associated steam<br>
turbine comprising at least one high-pressure stage.<br>
In a combined-cycle power plant, the heat<br>
contained in the expanded working medium from the gas<br>
turbine is utilized in order to generate steam for the<br>
steam turbine. Heat transmission takes place in a<br>
waste-heat steam generator which follows the gas<br>
turbine and in which the heating surfaces in the form<br>
of tubes or tube bundles are arranged. These, in turn,<br>
are connected into the water/steam circuit of the steam<br>
turbine. The water/steam circuit comprises one or more,<br>
for example two or three, pressure stages, each<br>
pressure stage conventionally having a preheating<br>
heating surface (economizer), an evaporator heating<br>
surface and a superheater heating surface. Depending on<br>
the pressure conditions prevailing in the water/steam<br>
circuit of the steam turbine, a thermodynamic effici-<br>
ency of about 50% or more is achieved by means of a<br>
combined-cycle power plant of this type which is known,<br>
for example, from EP 0,148,973 B1. <br>
The gas turbine of a combined-cycle power plant<br>
of this type may be designed to operate with different<br>
kinds of fuel. However, the requirements placed on the<br>
waste-heat steam generator following the gas turbine on<br>
the flue-gas side are different, depending on the type<br>
of fuel on which the design is based. For example, gas,<br>
as fuel for the gas turbine, normally has high purity,<br>
so that flue gas flowing out of the gas turbine<br>
contains only small amounts of impurities.<br>
In contrast to this, if the fuel for the gas<br>
turbine is fuel oil, impurities in the flue gas flowing<br>
out of the gas turbine are to be expected. In this<br>
case, in particular, sulphur dioxide (SO2) or sulphur<br>
trioxide (SO3) may occur, which, after reacting with<br>
water in the form of sulphuric acid (H2SO4), may settle<br>
on the heating surfaces in the waste-heat steam<br>
generator and attack these. The requirements placed on<br>
the waste-heat steam generator when oil is used as fuel<br>
for the gas turbine must therefore be different from<br>
those when gas is used as fuel for the latter.<br>
In particular, when oil is used as fuel for the<br>
gas turbine, it is necessary to ensure that the heating<br>
surfaces connected into the water/steam circuit of the<br>
steam turbine and the line components inside the waste-<br>
heat steam generator are at a sufficiently high<br>
temperature, namely a temperature above the dew point<br>
of sulphuric acid. For this purpose, when the gas<br>
turbine operates with oil, the inlet temperature of the<br>
water or condensate flowing into the waste-heat steam<br>
generator is raised, as compared with the gas turbine<br>
operating with the gas, and is set at about 120° to<br>
130°C.<br>
A combined-cycle power plant, in which fuel oil<br>
is provided as fuel for the gas turbine only for a<br>
brief operating period, for example for 500 to<br>
1,500 h/a, as "back-up" to natural gas, is usually<br>
designed and optimized primarily for the gas turbine to<br>
operate with natural gas. In order to ensure that, when<br>
the gas turbine operates with fuel oil, the condensate<br>
flowing into the waste-heat steam generator has a<br>
sufficiently high inlet temperature, the necessary heat<br>
may be extracted from the waste-heat steam generator<br>
itself in various ways.<br>
One possibility is to bypass a conventionally<br>
provided condensate preheater completely or partially<br>
and to heat the condensate by the supply of low-<br>
pressure steam in a feed-water tank connected into the<br>
water/steam circuit. However, at low steam pressures,<br>
such a method necessitates a large-volume and possibly<br>
multi-stage heating steam system in the feed-water<br>
tank, and, in the case of long heating-up periods, this<br>
may put at risk a deaeration function which normally<br>
takes place in the feed-water tank.<br>
In order to ensure effective deaeration of the<br>
condensate, the condensate temperature in the feed-<br>
water tank must always be maintained in a temperature<br>
range of between 130° and 160°C, and the heating-up<br>
period of the condensate in the feed-water tank should<br>
be kept as short as possible. This may be carried out,<br>
for example, by preheating the condensate via an<br>
additional preheater heated by means of steam.<br>
In order to provide sufficient heat for this<br>
purpose, in the case of two-pressure or three-pressure<br>
plants it is often necessary to extract hot water from<br>
a high-pressure economizer of the waste-heat steam<br>
generator. The disadvantage of this, however, particu-<br>
larly in the case of three-pressure plants, is that the<br>
delivery of a normally provided high-pressure feed pump<br>
may be influenced, and that the additional condensate<br>
preheater has to be designed in a particularly ineffi-<br>
cient way for the high pressure and large temperature<br>
differences.<br>
Furthermore, in the case of fuel-oil operation,<br>
throttle losses of the or each feed pump occur<br>
adversely. Moreover, the extraction of hot water from<br>
the high-pressure economizer leads to a reduction in<br>
the high-pressure steam quantity due to a lowering of<br>
a so-called high-pressure approach temperature, thus,<br>
in turn, leading to a reduction in plant efficiency.<br>
Another proven method is, when the gas turbine<br>
operates with oil, to assist the heating-up of the<br>
condensate in the feed-water tank or in the deaerator<br>
by means of steam extracted from an intermediate<br>
superheater line. However, this method cannot be<br>
employed in the case of plants without a feed-water<br>
tank or without a deaerator.<br>
The above-mentioned concepts of condensate<br>
preheating when oil is used as fuel for the gas turbine<br>
are complicated in view of the components which are<br>
required and also in view of the operating mode of the<br>
combined-cycle power plant. Moreover, plant efficiency<br>
is only limited when the gas turbine operates with oil.<br>
The object on which the invention is based is,<br>
therefore, to specify a method for operating a<br>
combined-cycle power plant of the above-mentioned type,<br>
by means of which, irrespective of the fuel used for<br>
the gas turbine, particularly high plant efficiency can<br>
be achieved at a low outlay in terms of apparatus and<br>
operation requirements. Moreover, a combined-cycle<br>
power plant particularly suitable for carrying out the<br>
method is to be specified.<br>
With regard to the method, the object mentioned<br>
is achieved, according to the invention, in that, after<br>
a change in the operation of the gas turbine from gas<br>
to oil, feed water to be supplied to the high-pressure<br>
stage of the steam turbine is divided into a first and<br>
a second part stream, only one of the part streams<br>
being preheated.<br>
The invention proceeds from the notion that the<br>
condensate preheating additionally necessary when the<br>
gas turbine operates with oil is ensured by particu-<br>
larly simple means and in a particularly simple way by<br>
transmitting the heat required for this purpose to the<br>
condensate not via the water/steam circuit, but,<br>
instead, via the flue gas from the gas turbine. In this<br>
case, the components, such as, for example, heat<br>
exchangers, mixing preheaters, steam reducing stations<br>
and/or corresponding pipelines, which are necessary in<br>
the transmission of heat via the water/steam circuit,<br>
may be dispensed with. Instead, when a gas turbine<br>
operates with oil, the extraction of heat from the flue<br>
gas of the gas turbine is reduced at a suitable point,<br>
as compared with the operation of the gas turbine with<br>
gas, so that a sufficiently large amount of exhaust-gas<br>
heat is available for condensate preheating.<br>
In this case, for a suitable modification of<br>
the extraction of heat from the flue gas of the gas<br>
turbine, the feed-water preheating for the high-<br>
pressure stage of the steam turbine is provided. In a<br>
combined-cycle power plant designed as a three-pressure<br>
plant, a corresponding modification of the feed-water<br>
preheating for the medium-pressure stage, the said<br>
modification being dependent on the operating mode, may<br>
also be provided alternatively or additionally.<br>
In an advantageous development, after the<br>
change of the operation of the gas turbine from gas to<br>
oil, the operating pressure in a low-pressure stage of<br>
the steam turbine is increased. This ensures that the<br>
heat, which, when the gas turbine operates with oil,<br>
remains in the flue gas due to the comparatively lower<br>
preheating of the feed water for the high-pressure<br>
stage, is not transmitted to the water/steam circuit of<br>
the steam turbine via the low-pressure heating sur-<br>
faces, but, in actual fact, is carried further in the<br>
flue gas and is thus provided reliably for condensate<br>
preheating.<br>
In this case, the operating pressure in the<br>
low-pressure stage may be set in such a way that steam<br>
production in the low-pressure stage comes to a stop.<br>
Expediently, however, the operating pressure in the<br>
low-pressure stage of the steam turbine is raised, for<br>
example to about 10 to 15 bar, in such a way that only<br>
some minimum steam production for maintaining the<br>
system functions still remains in the low-pressure<br>
stage.<br>
For particularly high efficiency, even in a<br>
transitional phase after a change in the operating mode<br>
of the gas turbine, the branching ratio between the<br>
first and the second part stream is advantageously set<br>
as a function of the temperature of the condensate to<br>
be supplied to the high-pressure stage. In this case,<br>
the temperature of the condensate flowing into the<br>
waste-heat steam generator may be monitored in a<br>
particularly favourable way.<br>
As regards the combined-cycle power plant, the<br>
object mentioned is achieved, according to the<br>
invention, in that a bypass line is connected in<br>
parallel with a feed-water preheater assigned to the<br>
high-pressure stage of the steam turbine.<br>
In this case, particularly favourable<br>
adaptation of feed-water preheating to the respective<br>
operating conditions is made possible preferably by<br>
connecting into the bypass line a valve capable of<br>
being set as a function of the temperature of the<br>
condensate to be supplied to the low-pressure stage.<br>
The advantages achieved by means of the<br>
invention are, in particular, that a water inlet<br>
temperature into the waste-heat steam generator which<br>
is necessary when the gas turbine operates with oil and<br>
which is increased, as compared with the operation of<br>
the gas turbine with gas, is ensured by particularly<br>
simple means. The complicated components, convention-<br>
ally provided in the additional condensate preheating<br>
necessary for this purpose, for transmitting heat from<br>
the water/steam circuit to the condensate, for example<br>
by the supply of low-pressure steam, may be dispensed<br>
with. Instead, sufficient heat transmission to the<br>
condensate is ensured due to the fact that the flue gas<br>
from the gas turbine still contains sufficient heat in<br>
the region of the condensate preheaters. The additional<br>
condensate-preheating heat necessary when the gas<br>
turbine operates with oil is therefore transmitted to<br>
the condensate directly via the flue gas. The outlay in<br>
terms of construction and operational requirements<br>
which is necessary for this purpose is particularly<br>
low.<br>
Furthermore, components of the water/steam<br>
circuit, such as, for example, the high-pressure feed-<br>
water pumps, may be given comparatively small<br>
dimensions, since they do not have to be designed for a<br>
bypass mode, when the gas turbine operates with oil,<br>
with additional water extraction from the economizer.<br>
Moreover, depending on the design of the low-pressure<br>
stage of the steam turbine and of the condensate pump,<br>
water inlet temperatures into the waste-heat steam<br>
generator of up to and above 130°C can be mastered.<br>
Virtually the entire fuel-oil spectrum for this purpose<br>
(back-up fuel) can therefore be covered, so that<br>
standardization is possible.<br>
An exemplary embodiment, of the invention is<br>
explained in more detail with reference to a drawing in<br>
which the figure shows a combined-cycle power plant<br>
diagrammatically.<br>
The combined-cycle power plant 1 according to<br>
the figure comprises a gas-turbine plant la and a<br>
steam-turbine plant 1b. The gas-turbine plant la<br>
comprises a gas turbine 2, with a coupled air<br>
compressor 4, and a combustion chamber 6 which precedes<br>
the gas turbine 2 and which is connected to a fresh-air<br>
line 8 of the air compressor 4 . Into the combustion<br>
chamber 6 of the gas turbine 2 opens a fuel line 10,<br>
via which gas or oil can be selectively supplied to the<br>
combustion chamber 6 as a fuel B for the gas turbine 2.<br>
The gas turbine 2 and air compressor 4 and a generator<br>
12 are seated on a common shaft 14.<br>
The steam-turbine plant lb comprises a steam<br>
turbine 20, with a coupled generator 22, and, in a<br>
water-steam circuit 24, a condenser 26 following the<br>
steam turbine 20 and a waste-heat steam generator 30.<br>
The steam turbine 20 consists of a first pressure stage<br>
or high-pressure part 20a, of a second pressure stage<br>
or medium-pressure part 20b and of a third pressure<br>
stage or low-pressure part 20c which drive the<br>
generator 22 via a common shaft 32.<br>
For supplying working medium AM or flue gas<br>
expanded in the gas turbine 2 into the waste-heat steam<br>
(generator 30,) an exhaust-gas line 34 is connected to an<br>
inlet 30a of the waste-heat steam generator 30. The<br>
expanded working medium AM from the gas turbine 2<br>
leaves the waste-heat steam generator 30, via the<br>
outlet 30b of the latter, in the direction of a chimney<br>
not illustrated in any more detail.<br>
The waste-heat steam generator 30 comprises a<br>
first condensate preheater 40 which can be fed with<br>
condensate K from the condenser 26 on the inlet side<br>
via a condensate line 42, into which a condensate pump<br>
unit 44 is connected. The condensate preheater 40 is<br>
connected on the outlet side to a high-pressure pump<br>
46. Moreover, the condensate line 42 is connected to<br>
the condensate line 45 via a circulating line 48 which<br>
can be shut off by means of a valve 47 and into which a<br>
circulating pump 49 is connected. The circulating line<br>
48, condensate line 42, condensate preheater 40 and<br>
condensate line 45 thus form a circulating loop for the<br>
condensate K, so that there is no need for a feed-water<br>
tank. Moreover, in order, if required, to bypass the<br>
high-pressure preheater 40, the condensate line 42 can<br>
be connected directly to the high-pressure pump 46 via<br>
a bypass line which is not illustrated.<br>
The high-pressure pump 4 6 brings the preheated<br>
condensate K, flowing out of the condensate preheater<br>
40, to a pressure level suitable for a high-pressure<br>
stage 50 of the water/steam circuit 24, the said high-<br>
pressure stage being assigned to the steam turbine 20.<br>
The condensate, which is under high pressure, can be<br>
supplied to the high-pressure stage 50 as feed water S<br>
via a feed-water preheater 52 which is connected on the<br>
outlet side to a high-pressure drum 58 via a feed-water<br>
line 56 capable of being shut off by means of a valve<br>
54 . The high-pressure drum 58 is connected to a high-<br>
pressure evaporator 60, arranged in the waste-heat<br>
steam generator 30, so as to form a water-steam cycle<br>
62. For the discharge of fresh steam F, the high-<br>
pressure drum 58 is connected to a high-pressure<br>
superheater 64 which is arranged in the waste-heat<br>
steam generator 30 and which is connected on the outlet<br>
side to the steam inlet 66 of the high-pressure part<br>
20a of the steam turbine 20.<br>
The steam outlet 68 of the high-pressure part<br>
20a of the steam turbine 20 is connected to the steam<br>
inlet 72 of the medium-pressure part 20b of the steam<br>
turbine 20 via an intermediate superheater 70. The<br>
steam outlet 74 of the said medium-pressure part is<br>
connected via an overflow line 76 to the steam inlet 78<br>
of the low-pressure part 20c of the steam turbine 20.<br>
The steam outlet 80 of the low-pressure part 20c of the<br>
steam turbine 20 is connected to . the condenser 26 via a<br>
steam line 82, so that a closed water/steam circuit 24<br>
is obtained.<br>
Moreover, a branch line 84 branches off from<br>
the high-pressure pump 4 6 at a point at which the<br>
condensate K has reached a medium pressure. The said<br>
branch line is connected via a second feed-water<br>
preheater 86 to a medium-pressure stage 90 of the<br>
water/steam circuit, the said medium-pressure stage<br>
being assigned to the steam turbine 20. The second<br>
feed-water preheater 86 is connected on the outlet side<br>
to a medium-pressure drum 96 of the medium-pressure<br>
stage 90 via a feed-water line 94 capable of being shut<br>
off by means of a valve 92. The medium-pressure drum 96<br>
is connected to a medium-pressure evaporator 98,<br>
arranged in the waste-heat steam generator 30, so as to<br>
form a water-steam cycle. For the discharge of medium-<br>
pressure fresh steam F", the medium-pressure drum 96 is<br>
connected via a steam line 102 to the intermediate<br>
superheater and therefore to the steam inlet 72 of the<br>
medium-pressure part 20b of the steam turbine 20.<br>
Downstream of the condensate pump unit 44, as<br>
seen in the direction of flow of the condensate K,<br>
moreover, a further condensate line 104 branches off<br>
from the condensate line 42 and opens into a second<br>
condensate preheater 106 arranged in the waste-heat<br>
steam generator 30. The second condensate preheater 106<br>
is connected on the outlet side, via a condensate line<br>
110 capable of being shut off by means of a valve 108,<br>
to a low-pressure stage 120 of the water/steam circuit<br>
24, the said low-pressure stage being assigned to the<br>
steam turbine 20.<br>
The low-pressure stage 120 comprises a low-<br>
pressure drum 122 which is connected to a low-pressure<br>
evaporator 124, arranged in the waste-heat steam<br>
generator 30, so as to form a water/steam cycle 126.<br>
For the discharge of low-pressure fresh steam F", the<br>
low-pressure drum 122 is connected to the overflow line<br>
76 via a steam line 128. Moreover, the condensate line<br>
110 is connected to the condensate line 104 via a<br>
circulating line 132 which is capable of being shut off <br>
by means of a valve 130 and into which a circulating <br>
pump 184 is connected. By means of the circulating pump<br>
184 condensate K can be circulated in a circulating<br>
loop formed by the circulating line 132, condensate<br>
line 104, condensate preheater 106 and condensate line<br>
110, so that there is no need for a feed-water tank.<br>
Moreover, in order, if required, to bypass the<br>
condensate preheater 106, the condensate line 104 can<br>
be connected directly to the condensate line 110 via a<br>
bypass line which is not illustrated.<br>
A bypass line 142 capable of being shut off by<br>
means of a valve 140 is connected in parallel with the<br>
feed-water preheater 52 assigned to the high-pressure<br>
stage 50. In this case, the valve 140 can be set as a<br>
function of the temperature of the condensate K to be<br>
supplied to the high-pressure stage 50 or to the<br>
medium-pressure stage 90. For this purpose, the valve<br>
140 is connected, in a way not illustrated in any more<br>
detail, to a controller unit, to which an input signal<br>
characteristic of the temperature of the condensate K<br>
to be supplied to the low-pressure stage 50 or to the<br>
medium-pressure stage 90 can be delivered.<br>
A bypass line 146 capable of being shut off by<br>
means of a valve 144 is likewise connected in parallel<br>
with the feed-water preheater 86 assigned to the<br>
medium-pressure stage 90. In a similar way to the valve<br>
140, the valve 144 can be set as a function of the<br>
temperature of the condensate K to be supplied to the<br>
high-pressure stage 50 or to the medium-pressure stage<br>
90.<br>
The gas turbine 2a of the combined-cycle power<br>
plant 1 can be operated with both gas and fuel oil as<br>
fuel B. When the gas turbine 2 operates with the gas,<br>
the working medium AM supplied to the waste-heat steam<br>
generator 30 has comparatively high purity, so that, in<br>
this operating stage, the efficiency of the water/steam<br>
circuit 24 can be optimized. In this operating state,<br>
the valves 140, 144 are closed, so that the entire feed<br>
water S conveyed by the high-pressure pump 46 is led<br>
through the feed-water preheaters 52 or 86 and is<br>
preheated there.<br>
When the gas turbine 2a operates with oil, the<br>
working medium AM supplied to the waste-heat steam<br>
generator 30 may contain impurities, in particular with<br>
sulphur dioxide SO2 and with sulphuric acid H2SO4. In<br>
order reliably to avoid damage to structural parts<br>
within the waste-heat steam generator 30 in this<br>
operating state, all the heating surfaces arranged in<br>
the waste-heat steam generator 30, that is to say, in<br>
particular, also the condensate preheater 40 and the<br>
condensate preheater 106, are operated at a temperature<br>
of more than the dew point of sulphuric acid. For this<br>
purpose, it is necessary to have an increased water<br>
inlet temperature for the condensate K flowing into the<br>
waste-heat steam generator 30 and, consequently,<br>
comparatively higher condensate preheating, as compared<br>
with the operation of the gas turbine 2 with gas.<br>
This comparatively higher condensate preheating<br>
is not achieved by transmitting heat from the<br>
water/steam circuit 24 to the condensate K, but,<br>
instead, by transmitting heat from the working medium<br>
AM directly to the condensate K. For this purpose,<br>
after a change of the operation of the gas turbine 2<br>
from gas to oil, the feed water S to be supplied to the<br>
high-pressure stage 50 and that to be supplied to the<br>
medium-pressure stage 90 are in each case divided into<br>
a first part stream Tl and a second part stream T2, in<br>
each case only one of the part streams Tl, T2 being<br>
preheated.<br>
In order to achieve this, the valves 140 and<br>
144 are in each case partially opened, so that the<br>
feed-water stream to be supplied to the high-pressure<br>
stage 50 is distributed to the feed-water preheater 52<br>
and to the bypass line 142. The feed-water stream to be<br>
supplied to the medium-pressure stage 90 is likewise<br>
distributed to the feed-water preheater 86 and the<br>
bypass line 146. As a result, less heat is extracted<br>
from the working medium AM in the region of the feed-<br>
water preheaters 52, 86, as compared with the operation<br>
of the gas turbine 2 with gas.<br>
In order to ensure reliable transmission of<br>
this heat remaining in the working medium AM to the<br>
condensate K, moreover, the operating pressure in the<br>
low-pressure stage 120 is raised to about 10 to 15 bar.<br>
This prevents the heat which has additionally remained<br>
in the working medium AM from being absorbed via the<br>
low-pressure evaporators 124. Reliable additional<br>
heating-up of the condensate K via the condensate<br>
preheaters 40, 106 is thereby ensured.<br>
The combined-cycle power plant 1 can be<br>
operated at inlet temperatures of the condensate K into<br>
the waste-heat steam generator 30 of up to and above<br>
130°C. A broad spectrum of fuel oils (back-up fuel) can<br>
therefore be used for the gas turbine 2, so that<br>
standardization of the combined-cycle power plant 1,<br>
irrespective of fuel oil, is also possible.<br>
