				<td>The present invention provides a new strain of Pseudomonas sp. strain RIJ12N having<br>
high nicotinic acid hydroxylase activity and capable of converting nicotinic acid to 6-<br>
hydroxynicotinic acid, the improvement which comprises the use of whole cell nicotinic<br>
acid hydroxylase which is obtained by culturing the microorganism in a nutrient medium<br>
containing glucose, ycast extract, peptone, mineral salts, and nicotinic acid or<br>
nicotinamide inducer.<br>
The main usage of the invention is to provide a process for the preparation of the<br>
Pseiidomonas sp. strain RLJ12N cells having high nicotinic acid hydroxylase aciivity<br>
which can be used under mild reaction conditions e.g. atmospheric pressure, temperature<br>
(10 to 40° C), pH 5.5-9.0 to hydoxylase nicotinic acid to 6-hydroxynicotinic acid.<br>
Several methods for the production of 6-hydroxynicotinic acid by organic syntheses<br>
are known(Lehky, US Patent No. 5,082,777(1992), Briancourt el al. I Chim. Ther. 8(2),<br>
pp226-232 (1973); Quarroz, Swiss Application No, 7731/80). However, the chemical<br>
syntheses of 6-hydroxynicotinic acid is difficult and cost intensive because of poor yield<br>
and the necessity of the separation of by-products that are produced by non-regioselective<br>
hydroxylations.<br>
Enzymatic conversion of nicotinic acid to 6-hydroxynicotinic acid under aerobic<br>
condition in aqueous solution using whole cells (either growing or resting cells) of the<br>
genera Psendomonas, Bacillus or Achramobacher are known. Hoek et al. [US Patent No.<br>
5,151,351(1992)] describes a process for the production of 6-hydroxynicotinic acid from<br>
nicotinic acid (as soluble sodium or potassium salt) using growing cells of<br>
Achromobacler xylosoxydans DSM2783 under aerobic conditions at 30°C, whereby 74g/l<br>
of 6-hydroxynicotinic acid with practically quantitative conversion of nicotinic acid was<br>
produced.<br>
A patent by Lehky etal. [US Patent No. 5,082,777 (1992)] claims that nicotinic acid<br>
can be converted to 6-hydroxynicotinic acid with whole cell nicotinic acid hydroxylase of<br>
the genera Pscmhmonas, Bacillus or Achmmohaclcr at 30-35' C under aerobic<br>
conditions. The process reveals that Achromobacter xylosoxydins DSM 2783,<br>
Pseudomonasputiaa NCIB 10521 and P. pulida NC1P 8176 could produce 3.5 percent<br>
by weight (93.7% yield), 0.542 percent by weight (97.5% yield) and 10 percent by weight<br>
(95.4% yield) of 6-hydroxynicotinic acid, respectively.<br>
A patent by Kiener et al. [US Patent No 5,516,661(1996)] describe:; the use of resting<br>
cells of Arthrobacter crystallopoietes DSM 7202, Pseudomonas acklovorans DSM 7203,<br>
Alcaligenesfaecalix DSM 7204 and P. acidovorans DSM 7205 to produce 3.14 percent<br>
by weight (41% yield), 6.05 percent by weight (80% yield), 5.6 percent by weight (73 %<br>
yield) and 6.4 percent by weight (85% yield) of 6-hydroxynicotinic acid, respectively.<br>
A patent by Kulla et al. [US Patent No 4,738,924 (1998 ) describe:; the use of resting<br>
cells of Achromobacter xylosoxyJans DSM 2783 to convert nicotinic acid in the form of<br>
easily soluble magnesium or barium salt to 6-hydroxynicolinic acitl, which is isolated as<br>
sparingly soluble magnesium or barium salt. The said patent claims that the resting cells<br>
of Achromohacter xylosoxydans DSM 2783 could produce 8.0 percent by weight of 6-<br>
hydroxynicotinic acid ( 91.6% yield) from magnesium nicotinate and 5.7 percent by<br>
weight of 6-hydroxynicotinic acid (64.7% yield) from barium nicotinate at 30°C.<br>
In the above mentioned processes, although the conversion of nicotinic acid to 6-<br>
hydroxynicotinic acid is quantitative in some cases, the final concentration of 6-<br>
Hydroxynicotinic acid in the reaction mixture is 10 percent by weight or less. However, a high product concentration in the reaction mixture is always desired for favorable cost economics, because the isolation of the product from a diluted reaction mixture leads to high costs of processing, investment and sewage treatment.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the hydroxylation of nicotinic acid to 6-hydroxynicotinic acid using whole cells of novel Pseudomonas sp. Strain MTCC 5126 having high nicotinic acid hydroxylase activity.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the hydroxylation of nicotinic acid to 6-hydroxynicontinic acid which comprises contacting nicotinic acid in the form of soluble or potassium salt in aqueous solution at pH 5.5-9.0 and temperature ranging between 10 to 40°C with whole cells of Pseudomonas sp. Strain MTCC 5126 having characteristics as herein described and having high nicotinic acid hydroxylase activity obtained by growing the cells under aerobic conditions characterized in that aqueous solution of soluble sodium or potassium salt is added at the beginning of the reaction or added continuously or by portions in a conventional nutrient medium containing glucose, an organic nitrogen source, phosphates, salts, and nicotinic acid or nicotinamide inducer, separating the cells from the reaction mixture by known method, and recovering the 6-hydroxynicotinic acid from the said supernatant by precipitation with concentrated hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid.<br>
The conventional nutrient medium used for growing the Pseudomonas sp. Strain MTCC 5126 having high nicotinic acid hydroxylase activity consists of glucose, Na2HPO4, KH2PO4, MgSO4, an organic nitrogen source, ferrous sulfate, sodium molybdate, and nicotinic acid or nicotinamide (inducer). The microorganism was grown under aerobic conditions for 10-40h in shaking flasks.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, in cultivation of Pseudomonas sp. Strain MTCC 5126 as used herein, the sterilized nutrient medium containing a carbon source e.g. glucose, an organic nitrogen source e.g. yeast extract, peptone, casein hydrolysate,<br><br><br><br>
glutamic acid (alone or in combination) , an inducer eg. nicotinic acid or nicotinamidc,<br>
phosphate and mineral salts. The cultivation is aerobically carried out with stirring at a<br>
pH value of 6 to 9 and at a temperature of 20 to 40"C, preferably al 25 to 35 °C, for a<br>
period of 10 to 40h. The resulting cells separated by centrifugation of the culturing broth<br>
is used for hydroxylation of nicotinic acid to 6-hydroxynicotinic acid<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the cells with high nicotinic acid<br>
hydroxylase can be produced in the unsterilized nutrient medium<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the nicotinic acid as soluble sodium<br>
or potassium salt acted on by I'.semhnionus sp strain RLJ12N by reaction in aqueous<br>
medium generally containing 10 to 20 percent by weight of the nicotinic acid at a<br>
temperature of from 10 to 40°C, and preferably 20 to 30°C, at a pH from 5.5 to 9.0, and<br>
preferably 6.0 to 8.0, for a period of from 10 to 48h under aerobic conditions, results in<br>
formation of 6-hydroxynicotinic acid at an yield of 99%, (based on the nicotinic acid<br>
used) by appropriately controlling the reaction conditions<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the 6-hydroxynicolinic acid thus<br>
formed by the action of the resting cells of Pseudomonas sp strain RLJ12N with<br>
nicotinic acid (as soluble sodium or potassium salt), can be recovered from the reaction<br>
mixture after removal of the cells by centrifugation and then adjusting the pi f of the said<br>
filtrate to pH 1.2 with concentrated hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid, whereby white<br>
crystals of 6-hydroxynicotinic acid is precipitated out. The crystals are then separated by<br>
filtration using suction, washed with ice cold water and dried at 50°C under vacuum.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the new bacterium used was<br>
isolated from a petroleum contaminated soil sample of the Borholla oil Held, Assam, by<br>
enrichment culture technique using n-hexadecane as the carbon source<br>

Strain MTCC 5126 is selected from a member or combination of the members of the group consisting of peptone, beef extract, yeast extract, casein hydrolysate and glutamic acid.<br>
3.	A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the said strain MTCC 5126 is cultivated at pH 6.0 to 9.0 to prepare cells containing intracellular nicotinic acid hydroxylase.<br>
4.	A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the said strain MTCC 5126 is cultured at 20 to 40°C to prepare cells containing intracellular nicotinic acid hydroxylase.<br>
5.	A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the known method used for recovering the cells of the said strain MTCC 5126 is centrifugation.<br>
6.	A process for the hydroxylation of nicotinic acid to 6-hydroxynicontinic acid substantially as herein described with reference to the examples.<br></td>
