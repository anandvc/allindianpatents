TIREAVHEEL BEAD ENTRAPMENT REMOVER<br>
Field [0001]       The disclosure generally relates to devices for mounting, inflating, and balancing a tire relative a wheel and more particularly to automated systems for removing an entrapment between a tire bead and a bead seat of a wheel prior to balancing an inflated tire mounted to a wheel.<br>
Background [0002]       Tire/wheel assembly facilities may incorporate one or more automated tire/wheel assembly lines for preparing vehicle tires and vehicle wheels. This process typically involves, amongst other operations: (a) the mounting of a tire onto a wheel, (b) the inflating of the tire to the desired pressure, and (c) the balancing of the tire/wheel assembly. _<br>
[0003]       Although automated tire/wheel assembling systems are known in the art, their use includes several drawbacks. One of these drawbacks includes their inability to flush entrapments, such as, for example, air bubble(s), lubricant, or the like, which may be microscopic in size, residing between a tire bead and a wheel bead seat when a tire is mounted to the wheel. Once the entrapment is present, it is factored into the balancing of the tire/wheel assembly. Subsequently, if the entrapment is bled out (e.g. during vehicle operation) the tire/wheel assembly may become imbalanced.<br>
[0004]       Accordingly, a need therefore exists for a device that removes entrapments, such as for example, air bubble(s), lubricant, or the like prior to balancing a tire/wheel assembly. As such, the present invention provides lire/wheel assemblies that may be balanced without entrapments, thereby increasing the potential that the tire/wheel assembly will not become imbalanced during normal operation of the vehicle.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings [0005]       The present disclosure will now be described, by way of example, with<br>

Detailed Description [0018]       A tire/wheel assembly is shown generally at 10 and a tireAvheel bead entrapment remover is shown generally at 100 and 200 in Figures lA, IB and 2A, 2B, respectively, according to an embodiment. Bead entrapment removers, in general, are also known in the art as "bead seaters" or "bead seating devices." As illustrated, the tire/wheel<br><br>
assembly 10 includes a tire 12 and a wheel 14 that are positioned on an assembly line cart 50.<br>
[0019]       Referring to Figures 1A and 2A, the tire/wheel bead entrapment remover 100, 200 may include a base portion 101, a locking and retaining device 103 for locking and retaining the cart 50 to the base portion 101, a plurality of vertical support arms 105 extending from the base portion 101, a horizontal support portion 107 supported by the plurality of vertical support arms 105, a plunger portion 109 that adjusts the positioning of a first working assembly 102a relative the tire/wheel assembly 10, a controller 113, a motor 115 driven by the controller 113 to cause movement of the plunger portion 109, and a first vacuum device 117a driven by the controller 113 and connected by a hose 119 to the first working assembly 102a. The plunger portion 109 moves the first working assembly 102a from a disengaged position (Figures 1 A, 2A) to an engaged position (Figures IB, 2B) according to the direction of the arrow, Z, such that a circumferential perimeter 103a of the first working assembly 102a comes into contact with and engages an outboard circumferential perimeter surface 16 of the tire 12.<br>
[0020]       The tire/wheel bead entrapment remover 100, 200 also includes a second working assembly 102b positioned on a support surface 52 of the cart 50. As illustrated, an inboard circumferential perimeter surface 18 of the tire 12 is positioned on top of a circumferential perimeter 103b of the second working assembly 102b. The second working assembly 102b is attached to a second vacuum device 117b driven by the controller 113 and connected to the second workmg assembly 102b by a hose 121. [0021]       According to an embodiment, the working assemblies 102a, 102b are designed to circumferentially and, optionally, sealingly-engage the outboard and inboard surfaces 16, 18 of the tire 12 to remove any entrapments, such as, for example, microscopic air bubbles, B (Figure IC), that may be circumferentially entrapped in an area 20 proximate where an outboard/inboard tire bead 22 of the tire 12 is seated within an outboard/inboard bead seat 24 of the wheel 14.<br>
(0022)       Referring now to Figure IB, the first and second working assemblies 102a. 102b respectively include a platen 104a, 104b, an oscillating motor 106a, 106b, and a hub engagement mechanism 108a, 108b. The oscillating motors 106a, 106b may be any type of motor, such as, for example, an electric motor, a hydraulic motor, a pneumatic motor, or the like that is designed to oscillate a working output shaft, press, clamp, or the like, which<br><br>
is shown generally at 110a, 110b. As illustrated, the working output shafts 110a, 110b are adapted to engage the hub mechanism 108a, 108b, which are effective, respectively, for providing forces according to the direction of arrows, F, F' from the working output shaft 110a, 110b to an outboard hub portion 26a, and an inboard hub portion 26b, respectively, of the wheel 14. If desired, the hub engagement mechanisms 108a, 108b and/or the shafts 110a, 110b may be joined together, through an opening, O, of the wheel 14 and one of the motors 106a, 106b.<br>
[0023]       According to the embodiment shown in Figures 1 A, IB, the outer peripheral portions 107 of platens 104a, 104b are designed to engage the outboard and inboard surfaces 16, 18, respectively, of the tire 12 to axially-fix (or confine) the positioning of the tire 12 from having any significant axial movement relative an axially-movable positioning of the wheel 14. While the tire 12 is restricted from any axial movement by outer peripheral portions 107 of the platens 104a, 104b, the hub engagement mechanisms 108a, 108c and/or working output shafts 110a, 110b are designed to clamp and axially-move the wheel 14 relative the tire 12.<br>
[0024]       Once the plunger portion 109 moves the first working assembly 102a to an engaged position as described above, the outer peripheral portions 107 of platens 104a, 104b circumferentially engage the outboard and inboard surfaces 16, 18 of time 12 while leaving a space S, between a facing surfaces 112a, 112b and an outermost circumferential periphery 28. 30 of the wheel 14. By leaving sufficient space S, axial movement of the wheel 14 relative the axially-fixed positioning of the platens 104a, 104b, as described below, will not result in contact between the platens 104a, 104b and the wheel 14. [0025]       According to an embodiment, the hub engagement mechanisms 108a, 108b are oscillated, respectively, according to the direction of arrows, F, F', in accordance with forces provided from one or more of the oscillating motors 106a, 106b, respectively. The forces, according to the direction of arrows, F, F', may be substantially parallel to an axis of rotation, A-A, of the tire/wheel assembly 10. Accordingly, the working output shafts 11 Da, 110b and/or hub engagement mechanisms 108a, 108b work on and axially-oscillate the positioning of the wheel 14 relative the axially-fixed positioning of the platens 104a, 104b that engage the outboard and inboard surfaces 16. 18 of the tire 12. [0026]       Referring to Figure ID, as a result of the forces applied to the wheel 14 according to the direction of the arrows, F, F', the wheel 14 is moved (relative to outer<br><br>
peripheral portion 107 of platens 104a, 104b) to cause the outboard/inboard tire bead 22 to be moved away from the outboard/inboard wheel bead seat 24. As a result, the forces applied in the direction of the arrows, F, F', entrapments, such as, for example, microscopic air bubbles, B (Figure 3), may be released. Accordingly, the tire/wheel entrapment remover 100 is effective for removing any entrapments, B, between the outboard/inboard tire bead 22 and the outboard/inboard beat seat 24 prior to balancing the tire/wheel assembly 10.<br>
[0027]       Referring now to Figures 2B, another embodiment is disclosed. According to the embodiment, the first and second working assemblies 102a, 102b respectively include a platen 104a, 104b, a platen moving device 206a, 206b, and a hub engagement mechanism 108a, 108b. The tire/wheel bead entrapment remover 200 also includes working output shafts 110a, 110b that are adapted to engage the hub mechanism 108a, 108b. The platen moving device 206a, 206b may include an electric motor, a hydraulic motor, a pneumatic motor, or the like.<br>
[0028]       The hub engagement mechanisms 108a, 108b and working output shafts 110a, 110b are designed to clamp and hold the wheel 14 in an axially-fixed position as the platens 104a, 104b are designed to engage and axially-move the positioning of the tire 12 relative the axially-fixed positioning of the wheel 14. Accordingly, once the plunger portion 109 moves the first working assembly 102a to an engaged position as described above, the outer peripheral portions 107 of platens 104a, 104b circumferentially engage the outboard and inboard surfaces 16, IS of the lire 12 while leaving a space S, bepvveen a facing surface 112a, 112b of each respective platen 104a, 104b and an outermost circumferential periphery 26, 28 of the wheel 14, By leaving space S, axial movement of the platens 104a, 104b and tire 12 relative the axially-fixed positioning of the wheel 14, as described below, will not result in contact between the platens 104a, 104b and the wheel 14.<br>
[0029]       According to an embodim.ent, the platens 104a, 104b are axially-moved (e.g. axially-oscillated) according to the direction of arrows, F, F', in accordance with forces provided from the platen moving devices 206a, 206B, respectively. The forces according to the direction of the arrows, F, F',  may be substantially parallel to an axis of rotation, A-A, of the tire/wheel assembly 10. Accordingly, axial movement of the platens 104a, 104b<br><br>
work on and axially-move / axially-oscillate the positioning of the tire 12 relative the axially-fixed positioning of the wheel 14.<br>
[0030]       Referring to Figure ID, the forces according to the direction of the arrows, F, F\ are applied by way of outer peripheral portions 107 of platens 104a, 104b to axially-move the tire 12 to result in the outboard/inboard tire bead 22 being axially-moved away from the axially-fixed wheel bead seat 24 of the wheel 14. As a result, the forces applied in the direction of the arrows, F, F', to the tire 12 causes the area 20, which may include entrapments, such as, for example, air bubbles, B, to be released. Accordingly, the tire/wheel entrapment remover 200 removes any entrapments, B, between the outboard/inboard tire bead 22 and the outboard/inboard beat seat 24 prior to balancing the tire/wheel assembly 10.<br>
[0031]       Accordingly, because of the relative movement caused between tire 12 and wheel 14, contact between the tire bead 22 and the wheel bead seat 24 is interrupted. This interruption primarily is characterized by portions of the outboard/inboard tire bead 22 being temporarily pulled away from the seating surface of outboard/inboard wheel bead seat 24. By axially moving the tire 12 or wheel 14 while holding the other in an axially* fixed relationship in this way, any entrapments, such as, for example, air bubbles, B, that may be entrapped between the tire bead 22 and the wheel bead seat 24 is/are released. [0032]       According to an embodiment, the first and/or second vacuum devices 117a, 117b may be activated when the tire 12 or wheel 14 is axially-moved as described above. As seen in Figure IE, a vacuum, V, may be applied by the first and/or second vacuum devices 117a, 117b to aid in the evacuation of entrapments, such as, for example, air bubble(s), B, lubricants, contaminants, or the like. Additionally, the vacuum, V, may assist in the positive seating of the tire bead 22 in the wheel bead seat 24 prior to balancing the tire/wheel assembly 10. It will be appreciated that by applying the vacuum, V, in the chamber defined by the platens (surfaces 112a, 112b) and the tire 12, any entrapped air, lubricant, or contaminants between the tire 12 and the facing surface 112a, 112b of each respective platen 104a, 104b may be more easily evacuated than in the case where no vacuum, V, is applied.<br>
[0033]       Referring now to Figure 3, a tire/wheel bead entrapment remover is shown generally at 300 according to an embodiment. The tire/wheel bead entrapment remover 300 generally includes a rotary motor 302, a rotary output shaft 304, and a hub engagement<br><br>
mechanism 306. The hub engagement mechanism 306 is effective for connecting the rotary output shaft 304 to the outboard and inboard hub portions 26a, 26b of the wheel 14. [0034]       The tire/wheel bead entrapment remover 300 also includes at least one kneading wheel 308a, 308b. As illustrated, the kneading wheel 308a engages the outboard surface 16 of the tire 12, and the kneading wheel 308b engages the inboard surface 18 of the tire 12. The kneading wheels 308a, 308b are manipulated to engage the outboard and inboard surfaces 16, 18, respectively, of the tire 12 generally proximate the area 20 that defines the region of the tire bead 22 and wheel bead seat 24.<br>
[0035]       As illustrated in Figures 3 and 4A, a radial axis, R-R, extends through the kneading wheels 308a, 308b and defines the axis of rotation of wheels 308a, 308b. An axle (not shown) may be aligned with the radial axis, R-R. As illustrated, the radial axis, R-R, traverses a radial line, X, which is shown radially extending from the axis of rotation, A-A, of the tire/wheel assembly 10 (Figure 4A).<br>
[0036]       According to an embodiment, the radial axis, R-R, is substantially misaligned with the radial line, X, and does not pass through the axis of rotation, A-A. By radially misaligning radial axis, R-R, with the radial line, X, the intersection of the radial axis, R-R, and the radial line, X, creates an offset angle, 9,<br>
[0037]       Accordingly, as seen in Figure 4B, by setting the radial axis, R-R, of the kneading wheel 308a, 308b in the manner described above, when tire/wheel assembly 10 is rotated by the rotary motor 302, the kneading wheel 308a, 308b provides a pulling or "kneadmg' effect, K, on the oulboard and inboard surface 16, 18 of the tire 12 proximate the region 20 bounded between the kneading wheel 308a, 308b and tire bead. By kneading, K, the outboard and inboard surface 16, 18 of the tire 12 in this way during rotation of the tire/wheel assembly 10, the interface surfaces between the tire bead 22 and the wheel bead seat 24 is temporarily disrupted, thereby releasing any entrapments, such as, for example, air bubbles, B, therebetween. Although not illustrated, vacuums 117a, 117b may be mcluded as shown in Figures 1 A, IB and 2A, 2B to aid in the removal of lubricants, contaminants, or the like in the area 20. Thus, the tire/wheel entrapment remover 300 removes any entrapments between the outboard/inboard tire bead 22 and the outboard/inboard beat seat 24 prior to balancing the tire/wheel assembly 10. [0038]       In an alternative embodiment as shown in Figures 5A and 5B, a tire/wheel bead entrapment remover is shown generally at 400 according to an embodiment. The<br><br>
tire/wheel bead entrapment remover 400 is substantially the same as that shown and described in Figures 3-4B except that the wheel, which is shown generally at 408a, 408b includes additional functionality and, in this embodiment, is referred to a wobble-wheel. [0039]       The wobble-wheel 408a, 408b is not snuggly fit to the radial axis, R-R, but rather, the wobble-wheel 408a, 408b is loosely-fitted about the radial axis, R-R. By loosely-fitting the wobble-wheel 408a, 408b relative the radial axis, R-R, the wobble-wheel 408b, 408b is allowed to "wander" or "wobble" and deviate angularly +/- between bounds defined by deviation angle, +A, -A (Figure 5B), relative to angle, G. A tire/wheel assembly 10 is rotated by rotary motor 302, wobble wheel 408a, 408b not only rotates about axis R-R (as described in conjunction with Figures 4A and 4B), it also wobbles between +/-Δ. The deviation angle, +A, shifts the radial axis from that shown at, R-R, to a radial axis, R+Δ-R+Δ, that correlates to an angle, 0+Δ- The deviation angle, -A, shifts the radial axis from that shown at, R-R, to a radial axis, R.A-R-A, that correlates to an angle, 6_Δ. [0040]       Accordingly, the wobbling effect, W, will introduce, in addition to kneading action, a dynamic vibration, pulling, and other disruptive forces, which is shown generally at KVP. The kneading, vibration, and pulling force, KVP, would otherwise not be present if wobble wheel 408a, 408b was tightly affixed to the radial axis, R-R, as shown and described in Figures 3-4B, Although the deviation angle, +A, -A, permits the radial axis, R-R, to the radial axis, R+A-R+A or R.Δ-R-Δ to change its orientation relative the radial line, X, it will be appreciated that the deviation angle, +A, -A, may be controlled to not permit the radial axis. R-Δ-R-Δ or RΔ-R-Δ,  to pass through the axis of rotation, A-A. [0041]        By providing the disruptive forces, FW, associated with the wobbling effect, W, the outboard and inboard surface 16, 18 of the tire 12, during rotation of the tire/wheel assembly 10, temporarily disrupts the interface between the tire bead 22 and the wheel bead seat 24, thereby releasing any entrapments, such as, for example, air bubbles, B. therebetvv'een.
