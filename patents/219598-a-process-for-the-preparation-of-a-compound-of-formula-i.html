COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10, Rule 13]<br>
"A PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF A COMPOUND OF FORMULA I."<br>
ASTRAZENECA   AB,   a   Swedish   company,   of   S-151   85   Sodertalje, SWEDEN,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, which inhibit basic carboxypeptidases, more specifically carboxypeptidase U, and thus can be used in the prevention and treatment of diseases wherein inhibition of carboxypeptidase U is beneficial. In further aspects, the invention relates to compounds of the invention for use in therapy; to processes for preparation of such new compounds; to pharmaceutical compositions containing at least one compound of the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, as active ingredient; and to the use of the active compounds in the manufacture of medicaments for the medical use indicated above.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Fibrinolysis is the result of a series of enzymatic reactions resulting in the degradation of fibrin by plasmin. The activation of plasminogen is the central process in fibrinolysis. The cleavage of plasminogen to produce plasmin is accomplished by the plasminogen activators, tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) or urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA). Initial plasmin degradation of fibrin generates carboxy-terminal lysine residues that serves as high affinity binding sites for plasminogen. Since plasminogen bound to fibrin is much more readily activated to plasmin than free plasminogen this mechanism provides a positive feedback regulation of fibrinolysis.<br>
One of the endogenous inhibitors to fibrinolysis is carboxypeptidase U (CPU). CPU is also known as plasma carboxypeptidase B, active thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFla), carboxypeptidase R and inducable carboxypeptidase activity. CPU is formed during coagulation and fibrinolysis from its precursor proCPU by the action of proteolytic enzymes e.g. thrombin, thrombin-thrombomodulin complex or plasmin. CPU cleaves basic amino acids at the carboxy-terminal of fibrin fragments. The loss of carboxy-terminal lysines and thereby of lysine binding sites for plasminogen then serves to inhibit fibrinolysis.<br><br>
WO 00766557<br>
By inhibiting the loss of lysine binding sites for plasminogen and thus increase the rate of plasmin formation, effective inhibitors of carboxypeptidase U would be expected to facilitate fibrinolysis.<br>
2-mercaptomethyl-3-guanidinoethylthiopropanoic acid is reported as a carboxypeptidase N inhibitor. More recently, this compound has been shown to inhibit CPU, Hendriks, D. et al, Biochimica et Biophysica Acta, 1034 (1990) 86-92.<br>
Guanidinoethylmercaptosuccinic acid is reported as a carboxypeptidase N inhibitor. More recently, this compound has been shown to inhibit CPU, Eaton, D. L.^, et al, The Journal of Biological Chemistry. 266 (1991) 21833-21838.<br>

Certain protected derivatives of compounds of Formula I, which may be made prior to a final deprotection stage to form compounds of Formula I, are novel.<br>
The use of protecting groups is described in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis', 2nd edition, T.W. Greene &amp; P.G.M. Wutz, Wiley-Interscience (1991). The protective group may also be a polymer resin such as Wang resin or a 2-chorotrityl chloride.resin.<br>
It will also be appreciated by those skilled in the art, although such protected derivatives of compounds of Formula I may not possess pharmacological activity as such, they may be administered parenterally or orally and thereafter metabolised in the body to form compounds of the invention which are pharmacologically active. Such derivatives may<br><br><br><br>
therefore be described as "prodrugs". All prodrugs of compounds of Formula I are included within the scope of the invention.<br>

Medical and pharmaceutical use<br>
The compounds of the invention are inhibitors of carboxypeptidase U either as such or. in the case of prodrugs, after administration. The compounds of the invention are thus expected to be useful in those conditions where inhibition of carboxypeptidase U is beneficial, such as in the treatment or prophylaxis of thrombosis and hypercoagulability in blood and tissues of mammals, including man.<br>
It is known that hypercoagulability may lead to thrombo-embolic diseases. Conditions associated with hypercoagulability and thrombo-embolic diseases which may be mentioned include protein C resistance and inherited or aquired deficiences in antithrombin III, protein C, protein S and heparin cofactor II. Other conditions known to be associated with hyper-coagulability and thrombo-embolic disease include circulatory and septic shock, circulating antiphospholipid antibodies, homocysteinami, heparin induced thrombocytopenia and defects in fibrinolysis. The compounds of the invention are thus indicated both in the therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of these conditions. The compounds of the invention are further indicated in the treatment of conditions where there is an undesirable excess of proCPU/CPU.<br>
Particular disease states which may be mentioned include the therapeutic and /or prophy¬lactic treatment of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, arterial thrombosis (e.g. in myocardial infarction, unstable angina, thrombosis-based stroke and peripheral arterial thrombosis) andsystemic embolism usually from the atrium during arterial fibrillation or from the left ventricle after transmural myocardial infarction.<br>
Moreover, the compounds of the invention are expected to have utility in prophylaxis of re-occlusion and restenosis {i.e. thrombosis) after thrombolysis, percutaneous trans-luminal angioplasty (PTA) and coronary bypass operations; the prevention of re-thrombosis after microsurgery and vascular surgery in general.<br>
Further indications include the therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of disseminated intravascular coagulation caused by bacteria, multiple trauma, intoxication or any other<br><br><br>
mechanism, fibrinolytic treatment when blood is in contact with foreisn surfaces in the body, such as vascuJar grafts, vascular stents, vascular catheters, mechanical and biological prosthetic valves or any other medical device, and fibrinolytic treatment when blood is in contact with medical devices outside the body, such as during cardiovascular surgery using a heart-lung machine or in haemodialysis.<br>
The compounds of the invention may aiso be combined and/or coadministered with any antithrombotic agent with a different mechanism of action, such as the antiplatelet agents acetylsalicylic acid ticlopidine, clopidogrel, thromboxane receptor and/or synthetase inhibitors, fibrinogen receptor antagonists, prostacyclin mimetics and phosphodiesterase<br>
inhibitors and ADP-receptor (P2T) antagonists and thrombin inhibitors.<br>
