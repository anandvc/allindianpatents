				<td>The present invention relates to a vein stripper with a probe and a coagulation and cutting unit. The<br>
invention relates to a vein stripper comprising a probe and a coagulation and cutting unit, with the<br>
coagulation and cutting unit comprising at least two electrodes and a face opening through which the<br>
probe can be guided.<br>
Vein strippers are known from the field of surgery.<br>
SU 1 498 473 A1 discloses a vein stripper which is connected with a probe. The vein stripper<br>
comprises a ring knife with a nose, with the nose having an opening with an electrode situated<br>
therein. The ring knife is arranged as a further electrode. During the vein stripping, the tissue around<br>
the vein is cut by the ring knife. The grasping of venous side branches is indicated by an increased<br>
mechanical resistance. The venous side branch can be cut through with the cutting edge of the nose<br>
by turning the vein stripper and tan be coagulated with the electrode by means of high-frequency<br>
currents. The disadvantageous aspect in a vein stripper according to SU 1 498 473 A1 is that smaller<br>
venous side branches are severed without any noticeable increase in the mechanical resistance and<br>
are not coagulated. The further disadvantageous aspect is that the venous side branches can only be<br>
coagulated when they are recognized shortly before the severing. If a venous side branch has been<br>
recognized and has already been cut, the required position of the vein stripper for coagulation can no<br>
longer be found. This relates both to the position in the longitudinal direction of the vein stripper as<br>
well as the angle of rotation to be set. The coagulation represents a complex and protracted<br>
procedure. A further disadvantage of the vein stripper according to SU 1 498 473 A1 is that due to<br>
the stresses during the vein stripping, hemorrhages will also occur in veins in the ambient tissue,<br>
whereby said veins are not coagulated. A further disadvantageous aspect in the vein stripper<br>
according to SU 1 498 473 A1 is that inadvertent injuries to the ambient tissue may occur as a result<br>
of the sharp cutting edge of the ring knife.<br>
It is therefore the object of the present invention to provide a vein stripper of the kind mentioned<br>
above which eliminates these disadvantages and ensures the coagulation of nearly all venous side<br>
branches.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a vein stripper of the kind mentioned above<br>
which also coagulates injured veins in the ambient tissue.<br><br>
It is a further object of the invention to provide a vein stripper of the kind mentioned above in<br>
which the impairment to the ambient tissue by inadvertent cuts is kept low.<br>
It is further an object of the invention to provide a vein stripper of the kind mentioned above<br>
which ensures the cutting and coagulation in one working step.<br>
This is achieved in accordance with the invention in such a way that at least two of the at least<br>
two electrodes are arranged adjacently over the circumference of the coagulation and cutting unit,<br>
which circumference is situated in the region of the face opening.<br>
This embodiment comes with the advantage that it can be used in conjunction with current vein<br>
strippers. It comes with the further advantage that a blood-dry strip channel is achieved, as a<br>
result of which the use of pressure bandages is not mandatory. Moreover, the traumatizing of the<br>
ambient tissue is substantially prevented by the vein stripper in accordance with the invention.<br>
This leads to the further advantage that the operation with the vein stripper in accordance with<br>
the invention can be performed throughout the whole year and not only in the cold season.<br>
The invention further relates to a vein stripper with a probe and a coagulation and cutting unit,<br>
with the coagulation and cutting unit comprising at least one electrode and a face opening<br>
through which the probe can be guided.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to present a vein stripper of the kind mentioned above<br>
which remedies the disadvantages as mentioned above, ensures the coagulation of nearly all<br>
venous side branches, also coagulates injured veins in the ambient tissue, keeps the impairment<br>
to the ambient tissue by inadvertent cuts low, ensures the cutting and coagulation in one working<br>
step and comes with a simple and secure design.<br>
This is achieved in accordance with the invention in such a way that the probe is arranged at least<br>
along a region of its length as an electrode.<br>
This embodiment comes with the advantage that due to the spatial separation of the electrodes<br>
the likelihood of a short is especially low. A blood-dry strip channel is also achieved with this<br>
vein stripper in accordance with the invention, thus ensuring that the use of pressure bandages is<br>
no longer mandatory. Moreover, the traumatisms, of the ambient tissue is substantially prevented.<br><br>
This leads to the further advantage that the operation with the vein stripper in accordance with<br>
the invention can be performed throughout the whole year and not only in the cold season.<br>
In a further development of the invention it can be provided that at least one of the at least one<br>
electrode is arranged adjacently over the circumference of the coagulation and cutting unit,<br>
which circumference is situated in the region of the face opening. In this way the coagulation can<br>
be ensured in all directions around the opening.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention it can be provided that at least one of the<br>
electrodes is provided with an annular arrangement. As a result of the annular arrangement the<br>
enclosure of the opening by the electrode can be ensured.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention it can be provided that at least one of the<br>
electrodes is provided with a spiral configuration. The spiral configuration allows enclosing the<br>
opening with an electrode several times.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention it can be provided that at least one of the electrodes<br>
comprises interruptions. Other electrodes can be guided by the interruptions, thus allowing the<br>
electrodes to be arranged in one plane.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention it can be provided that at least one of the electrodes<br>
comprises fan-shaped fingers. The fan-shaped fingers allow considerably enlarging the region in<br>
which the coagulation and cutting takes place, thus considerably improving the security of the<br>
coagulation of all venous side branches.<br><br>
It can be provided for in a further development of the invention that an annular ultrasonic resonator<br>
is arranged in the region of the electrodes. The ultrasonic resonator can be arranged as a cutting unit<br>
and the electrodes as a coagulation unit, thus separating the cutting process and the coagulation<br>
process and thus allowing them to be set and controlled independent from one another in a very<br>
simple manner.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a vein stripper with a probe and a coagulation and<br>
cutting unit, with the coagulation and cutting unit having at least two electrodes and an opening on<br>
the face side through which the probe can be guided, characterized in that at least one of the<br>
electrodes is provided with a ring-like arrangement and that at least two of the at least two electrodes<br>
are adjacently arranged over the circumference of the coagulation and cutting unit situated in the<br>
region of the opening on the face side.<br>
The invention further provides a vein stripper with a probe and a coagulation and cutting unit, with<br>
the coagulation and cutting unit having at least one electrode and an opening on the face side through<br>
which the probe can be guided, characterized in that at least one of the electrodes is provided with a<br>
ring-like arrangement and that the probe is designed as an electrode at least along a section of its<br>
length.<br>
The invention is now explained in closer detail by reference to the accompanying drawings showing<br>
especially preferred embodiments, wherein:<br>
Fig. 1a shows a vein with side branches in the connective tissue in a section view;<br>
Fig. 1b shows a sectional view of the exposed vein according to fig. la with the probe and its end<br>
and handle guided through said vein;<br>
Fig. 1c shows a sectional view of the vein according to fig. la with bulging during the stripping<br>
process;<br>
Fig. 2a shows a sectional view of a vein in the connective tissue with threaded electrodes;<br>
Fig. 2b shows an illustration of an arrangement of the electrodes relative to the vein;<br>
Fig. 3a shows a side view of the electrodes in two different planes;<br>
Fig. 3b shows a side view of a further arrangement of the electrodes in two different planes;<br>
Fig. 3c shows a side view of the electrodes in the same plane;<br>
Fig. 3d shows a further possible arrangement of the electrodes in a top view;<br>
Fig. 4a shows a coagulation and cutting unit of a vein stripper in accordance with the invention in a<br>
side view;<br>
Fig. 4b shows a side view of a vein stripper in accordance with the invention, with the coagulation<br>
and cutting unit having a cylindrical basic body;<br><br>
cording to a further embodiment of the invention it can be provided that the coagulation and<br>
cutting device comprises a displacement device, in particular a shaft or the like, and that the<br>
probe is configured as a guide probe. The coagulation and cutting unit can be moved by the<br>
probe through the displacement device, with the probe not being moved simultaneously and only<br>
being used as a guide means. In this way the vein can be cut out first and the venous side<br>
branches can be coagulated and only then can the vein be removed. In this way it is not<br>
necessary that the coagulation and cutting unit receives the vein, so that the dimensions of the<br>
coagulation and cutting unit can be kept small.<br>
It can be provided in a further development of the invention that the coagulation and cutting unit<br>
comprises a drive apparatus, with the same being automatically movable along the probe. No<br>
displacement device is required any more as a result of the drive apparatus, thus ensuring that the<br>
movement about a curved probe can be performed more easily.<br>
It can be provided in a further embodiment of the invention that the coagulation and cutting unit<br>
comprises at least one further electrode, especially at least three further electrodes. As a result of<br>
the further electrodes it is possible to enlarge the region in which the cutting and/or coagulation<br>
is performed. This increases the security that all venous side branches are coagulated.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention it can be provided that the at least one<br>
further electrode is arranged on the wall surface of the coagulation and cutting unit. The<br>
attachment of the at least one further electrode to the wall surface of the coagulation and cutting<br>
unit increases the coagulation region after the severing of the venous side branch and thus<br>
increases the security that all venous side branches are coagulated.<br>
It can be provided for in a further development of the invention that the electrodes are arranged<br>
at difference distances from the respectively adjacent electrodes. By choosing difference<br>
distances it is possible to achieve different activity regions between two electrodes.<br>
According to another arrangement of the invention it can be provided that at least one of the<br>
electrodes is connected with a resistor or the like. Different activity regions can be achieved<br>
through the connection with a resistor or the like<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention it can be provided that the coagulation and cutting unit<br>
comprises a basic body which is aligned along a longitudinal axis and the at least two of the at<br><br>
fast two electrodes are attached to a first face side of the basic body. The electrodes can be<br>
fastened to the basic body. By attaching the electrodes to a first face side it is ensured that<br>
venous side branches reach the activity region of the electrodes before they tear off.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention it can be provided that the coagulation and<br>
cutting unit comprises two electrodes which are arranged in a substantially annular fashion, with<br>
the axes of symmetry of the annular electrodes extending substantially parallel with respect to<br>
each other and with the surfaces which are each opened by the annular electrodes substantially<br>
overlapping each other when viewed in the axial direction of the axes of symmetry. This<br>
embodiment ensures a simple construction of the coagulation and cutting unit. It is not necessary<br>
to configure the probe as an electrode.<br>
It can be provided for in a further development of the invention that the at least one further<br>
electrode is provided with an annular arrangement whose axis of symmetry extends substantially<br>
parallel to the axes of symmetry of the two other annular electrodes, with the surface which is<br>
opened up by the at least one further annular electrode and the surfaces which are opened up by<br>
the two other annular electrodes substantially overlapping each other when viewed in the axial<br>
direction of the axes of symmetry. The security in the coagulation of all venous side branches<br>
can be improved by using at least three annular electrodes.<br>
In accordance with another embodiment of the invention it can be provided that the axes of<br>
symmetry of the annular electrodes extend substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the<br>
basic body. This embodiment allows achieving a rotationally symmetrical effect of the electrodes,<br>
so that its effect is not changed by any inadvertent rotation of the coagulation and cutting unit.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention it can be provided that the annular electrodes<br>
lie in one and the same plane extending substantially normal to the longitudinal axis of the basic<br>
body. As a result of this embodiment the cutting effect of the coagulation and cutting unit can be<br>
improved in particular, as a result of which an only very low tensile force is required for<br>
coagulation and cutting.<br>
In accordance with a further embodiment of the invention it can be provided that the basic body<br>
encloses a substantially cylindrical space. This leads to the advantage that the coagulation and<br>
cutting unit can be placed closely around the vein. Moreover, the second face side of the basic<br><br>
ody can be placed on the end of a conventional vein stripper and can thus be pulled with the<br>
same over the vein, with venous side branches being severed by the coagulation and cutting unit.<br>
In a further development of the invention it can be provided that the basic body is provided with<br>
at least one web aligned in the longitudinal axis of the basic body. This allows the vein which<br>
arches in the region of the basic body by the tension to expand sufficiently without clogging the<br>
basic body, as a result of which the coagulation and cutting unit can be provided with a<br>
configuration of merely a low length.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention it can be provided that the basic body<br>
comprises the holding apparatus for receiving arc! fixing the end of the probe in the region of its<br>
second face side. A separate closure of the vein stripper is thus no longer required. This<br>
arrangement comes with the additional advantage that the use of the coagulation and cutting unit<br>
in the wrong direction is excluded, thus reducing the likelihood of an error during operation.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention it can be provided that the basic body<br>
comprises the holding apparatus for receiving and fixing the end of the probe on its second face<br>
side. The overall length of the coagulation and cutting unit can be reduced by arranging the<br>
holding apparatus on the second face side.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention it can be provided that the holding apparatus allows an<br>
interlocking connection between the end of the probe and the basic body. It is ensured through<br>
the interlocking configuration of the connection that the connection is not detached inadvertently.<br>
In a further development of the invention it can be provided that the holding apparatus comprises<br>
a slot incorporated in the side wall of the basic body for inserting the probe as well as a recess for<br>
receiving the end of the probe. The recess comprises a web at its side facing the first face side of<br>
the basic body which narrows the same. This arrangement allows a simple and secure connection<br>
between the probe and the basic body.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention it can be provided that the recess comprises<br>
an extension on its side facing the first face side of the basic body. The permanence of the<br>
connection can be improved by the extension.<br><br>
a further development of the invention it can be provided that electric lines for connecting the<br>
electrodes with a power supply source are guided in a centric fashion out of the basic body on the<br>
second face side of the basic body. This configuration allows moving the coagulation and cutting<br>
unit by means of the electric lines without any tilting moment.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention it can be provided that the holding apparatus<br>
comprises two contacts which are electrically conductively connected with the electrodes and<br>
that the electric lines are guided within the probe for connecting the electrodes with an electric<br>
power source and are connected with further contacts situated at the end of the probe, with the<br>
electric conductive connection between the annular electrodes and the power supply source<br>
occurring by means of the contacts and the further contacts when receiving and fixing the probe<br>
in the holding apparatus. As a result, it is not necessary to provide any separate cables for<br>
connecting the electrodes with the power supply source because the connection is made through<br>
the probe.<br>
In a further development of the invention it can be provided that a drainage tube is arranged on<br>
the coagulation and cutting unit. In this way the drainage tube can be introduced into the<br>
stripping channel in one step with the stripping.<br>
In this connection it can be provided in a further development of the invention that a drainage<br>
tube fastening apparatus is arranged on the face side of the coagulation and cutting unit which is<br>
opposite of the opening. When using the vein stripper in accordance with the invention for two<br>
vein pieces, the drainage tube situated in the strip channel after the first vein piece can be cut off<br>
and a further drainage tube can be fastened again on the coagulation and cutting unit.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention it can be provided that a longitudinal slitting<br>
apparatus is provided. The vein stripper in accordance with the invention can be guided about the<br>
vein by the longitudinal slitting apparatus, with the vein only being removed from the strip<br>
channel after the vein stripping. This leads to the advantage that the vein can remain in the<br>
stretched position during the stripping.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention it can be provided that the longitudinal<br>
slitting apparatus comprises a slot electrode for monopolar cutting, a slot electrode for bipolar<br>
cutting or a mechanical blade. A secure slitting of the vein in the longitudinal direction can be<br>
ensured by each of these three embodiments.<br><br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention it can be provided that the longitudinal<br>
slitting apparatus can be latched together with the probe, especially with a groove or the like. The<br>
secure slitting of the vein in the longitudinal direction can be ensured with this embodiment.<br>
It can be provided for in a further embodiment of the invention that the longitudinal slitting<br>
apparatus can be fixed in the holding apparatus and comprises a further holding apparatus for<br>
receiving and fixing the end of the probe. This arrangement allows a modular configuration of<br>
the coagulation and cutting unit and the longitudinal slitting apparatus.<br>
It can be provided for in a further development of the invention that in the region of at least one<br>
of the electrodes at least one outlet opening for the outlet of an ionizable gas, especially argon, is<br>
provided. Coagulation occurs already before the electrodes by the ionizable gas. The likelihood<br>
is thus reduced that encrustations or the like stick to one of the electrodes and are torn open<br>
during the movement of the vein stripper. The ionizable gas is supplied via a gas supply line.<br>
In this connection it can be provided according to a further embodiment of the invention that the<br>
at least one outlet opening is joined to a gas connection on the second face side of the basic body.<br>
The gas supply line and the electric lines can be guided in parallel and optionally in a common<br>
tube.<br>
It can be provided for in a further embodiment of the invention that at least one suction opening<br>
is provided. The smoke produced during the coagulation can be sucked off by means of the<br>
suction opening and can be removed by means of a suction line.<br>
In this connection it can be provided for in a further development of the invention that the at least<br>
one suction opening is arranged in the holding apparatus. This configuration ensures that the<br>
suction opening can be configured independent of the coagulation and cutting unit, thus ensuring<br>
a favorable suction.<br>
It can be provided for in a further embodiment of the invention that the at least one suction<br>
opening is joined to a suction connection on the second face side of the basic body. This ensures<br>
that the electric lines, the suction line and optionally the gas supply line can be guided in parallel<br>
and can optionally be arranged in a common tube.<br><br>
can be provided for in a further development of the invention that an annular ultrasonic<br>
resonator is arranged in the region of the electrodes. The ultrasonic resonator can be arranged as<br>
a cutting unit and the electrodes as a coagulation unit, thus separating the cutting process and the<br>
coagulation process and thus allowing them to be set and controlled independent from one<br>
another in a very simple manner.<br>

The present invention relates to techniques of electrosurgery and high-frequency surgery and<br>
especially to the coagulation and cutting of biological material or tissue by means of high-<br>
frequency current flowing through the tissue. The effects on the biological material at low-<br>
frequency currents are the electrolytic effect and the Faraday effect. These two effects are not<br>
desirable in electrosurgery because they can lead on the one hand to electrolytic damage and on<br>
the other hand to undesirable muscular contractions. For this reason only high-frequency currents<br>
with frequencies from approx. 300 kHz are used in electrosurgery. At such frequencies there is<br>
no ion displacement in the tissue and muscular contractions no longer occur. A heating of the<br>
tissue is achieved through the thermal effect. This can be used for coagulating or cutting the<br>
tissue.<br>
During the coagulation in which the tissue is heated to approx. 100°C, the intra- and extra-<br>
cellular liquid evaporates. The tissue-shrinks as a result, with the cell membranes remaining<br>
intact, however. Hemorrhages can thus be stopped with a high degree of success. During the<br>
cutting, the tissue is abruptly heated to temperatures which are slightly above 100°C, so that the<br>
cell membranes rupture in an explosive fashion. This allows performing precise cuts in the tissue.<br>
Two techniques of electrosurgery are obtained from the shaping of the electrodes for connection<br>
with the high-frequency power supply source. In the monopolar technique a large-surface so-<br>
called neutral electrode is attached to the patient's body. The size of the electrode ensures that<br>
only very low current densities occur in the region, thus leading to only very low or negligible<br>
heating. The heating occurs in the region of the active electrode which is provided with an acute<br>
configuration and causes considerable current densities in the tissue in this region. In bipolar<br>
technique the two electrodes are situated very close to each other and are integrated in one unit,<br>
if possible. The current only flows in the closely defined tissue region between the two<br>
electrodes.<br>
The vein stripper in accordance with the invention relates to the bipolar technique for<br>
coagulating and cutting organic material.<br>
It is often necessary in the case of vascular or venous diseases to remove a certain section 102 of<br>
a vein 100 (fig. la to lc).<br><br>
For this purpose the connective tissue 105 is cut in the upper region 103 which is closer to the<br>
heart and is adjacent to the section 102 and in the lower region 104 which is further from the<br>
heart, the vein 100 is severed and the two ends of the section 102 of the vein 100 to be removed<br>
are exposed.<br>
In a next step the probe 100 of a vein stripper is introduced into the section 102 of vein 100 to be<br>
removed.<br>
An end piece 111 is attached to probe 110 in the lower region 103, which end piece prevents the<br>
slippage of the vein 100 from the probe 110. The probe 110 is then pulled by means of a handle<br>
112 attached to the upper end of the probe 110 through the connective tissue 105 by entraining<br>
the section 102 to be removed and pulled out in the upper region 103 in the pulling direction as<br>
indicated by arrow 113.<br>
As is indicated in fig. 1c, a bulging of the vein 100 and an increased formation of folds in the<br>
vein wall occur in the region 114 upstream of the end piece 111. The disadvantageous aspect in<br>
this method is that the venous side branches 101 which open into the vein 100 are torn off during<br>
this process. This causes substantial bleeding and leads to longer hospital stays with subsequent<br>
bandaging and the need to rest the treated body part..<br>
The vein stripper in accordance with the invention allows eliminating this disadvantage. This is<br>
achieved in such a way that the venous side arms 101 are not torn out of the connective tissue<br>
105 with the vein 100 or are not torn off when pulling out the vein section 102. Instead, they are<br>
previously sealed with the presented unit and are severed from vein 100.<br>
This occurs by the aforementioned electrosurgical coagulation or cutting of the venous side<br>
branches 101 in the region of their opening into vein 100.<br>
For this purpose the vein stripper in accordance with the invention comprises a coagulation and<br>
cutting unit 1 which according to a first embodiment of the vein stripper in accordance with the<br>
invention is arranged with at least two electrodes 8, 4, 5 which can be substantially annular in<br>
shape. According to another embodiment of the vein stripper in accordance with the invention,<br>
the probe 110 is arranged as electrode 3, 4, 5 and the coagulation and cutting unit 1 is provided<br><br>
with at least one electrode 3, 4, 5, with the vein stripper in accordance with the invention having<br>
again at least two electrodes 3, 4, 5.<br>
As a result of the annular arrangement of the electrodes 3, 4, 5 they can be threaded over the vein<br>
100.<br>
This produces a generally annular region which encloses the vein 100 (which is referred to<br>
hereinafter as the activity region 6), in which the biological material which encloses the vein 100<br>
can be coagulated or cut. As a result, the venous side branches 101 can be severed from the vein<br>
100 in the region of their opening into vein 100 (fig. 2). It is thus possible on the one hand to<br>
sever the venous side branches 101 directly. On the other hand, it is sufficient to produce a<br>
coagulation of the venous side branches 101. They are thus sealed off and are cleanly severed at<br>
the coagulated place during the subsequent extraction of the section 102 of vein 100 to be<br>
removed without producing any relevant bleeding.<br>
The optimal radius of the electrodes 3, 4, 5 is based on the physiological conditions. They are<br>
determined by the diameter of the vein 100. On the other hand, the diameter of the electrodes 3,<br>
4, 5 should be kept as small as possible in order to ensure that as little as possible of the ambient<br>
connective tissue 105 is injured. In this respect the annular configuration of the electrodes 3, 4, 5<br>
is especially advantageous in vein stripping because the electrodes 3, 4, 5 can be placed<br>
especially closely on the vein 100. Other configurations of the electrodes 3, 4, 5 are possible, e.g.<br>
as closed loops of rectangular layout, etc. Such electrodes 3, 4, 5 shall apply as substantially<br>
annular electrodes 3, 4, 5 within the terms of the invention.<br>
For the purpose of slipping the substantially annular electrodes 3, 4, 5 over the vein 100 they are<br>
arranged in such a way that the axes of symmetry 3', 4', 5' of the electrodes 3, 4, 5 extend<br>
substantially parallel to the central line 100' of the vein 100 (fig. 2b). The axes of symmetry 3',<br>
4', 5' of the electrodes 3, 4, 5 thus extend substantially parallel with respect to each other.<br>
Furthermore, the surfaces which are each opened by the electrodes 3, 4, 5 overlap when they are<br>
seen in the axial direction of the axes of symmetry 3', 4', 5'. This overlapping can be complete<br>
or only partial, depending on the configuration of the individual electrodes 3, 4, 5.<br>
This obviously also applies to electrodes 3, 4, 5 where no precise axes of symmetry 3', 4', 5' can<br>
be defined, which comprise convexities or the like for example.<br><br>
ne arrangement of the substantially annular electrodes 3, 4, 5 can occur in any case in analogy<br>
to the arrangement outlined in fig. 2b.<br>
The precise arrangement of the electrodes 3, 4, 5 influences the position and extension of the<br>
activity region 6, i.e. the region in which the thermal effects on the tissue are the highest. The<br>
activity region 6 is defined by the region in which the current density between the electrodes 3, 4,<br>
5 is the highest.<br>
The form and the structure of the activity region 6 are naturally also dependent on other factors,<br>
especially the used current and voltage intensities. Different methods of coagulation such as soft<br>
coagulation, forced coagulation and spray coagulation can be set by choosing the initial voltages.<br>
Figs. 3a to 3d show a number of possible advantageous arrangements of the electrodes 3, 4, 5<br>
and the activity regions 6 arising from these arrangements.<br>
The activity regions 6 are each indicated by the broken lines. They are obtained as intersecting<br>
lines between the edge surface of the three-dimensional, substantially annular activity region 6<br>
and the plane of projection which is indicated by the plane 6'. The activity region 6 defined by<br>
the annular electrodes 3, 4, 5 is in any case a three-dimensional, approximately annular area.<br>
Generally, the activity region 6 can be defined as a torus, with a circular or even elliptical or<br>
rectangular layout.<br>
Fig. 3a shows an arrangement in which two electrodes 3, 4 are situated in two different planes<br>
which are spaced from each other and are substantially parallel. This leads to an activity region 6<br>
for the bipolar coagulation and cutting which is situated between the two electrodes 3, 4, as<br>
indicated. With this arrangement a venous side branch 101 is grasped at first by the electrode 4<br>
when moving the two electrodes 3, 4 in the pulling direction 113. Only when there is further<br>
pulling will the side branch 101 be bent into the activity region 6 and be coagulated or cut there.<br>
In this case it is appropriate to provide a separa'.e protective sleeve 115 which prevents that the<br>
vein 100 per se is severed.<br>
Fig. 3b shows an arrangement with two electrodes 3, 4, 5 of different diameters which are again<br>
situated in two spaced planes. The indicated aclivity region 6 leads to cutting or coagulating the<br><br>
enous side branch 101 already at an earlier point, i.e. in the case of a slight pull. A protective<br>
sleeve 115 can be provided in this case too.<br>
In the arrangement as shown in fig. 3c, the two electrodes 3, 4 are situated in the same plane. An<br>
activity region 6 is thus obtained which extends in a non-substantial way over the edge formed<br>
by the inner electrode 4 and the outer electrode 3. As a result, the vein 100 per se is not situated<br>
in the activity region 6. During the movement in the pulling direction 113 the venous side<br>
branches 101 are severed already prior to and especially during the contact with one of the two<br>
electrodes 3, 4. This facilitates the forward cutting, because the activity region is situated in the<br>
pulling direction 113. A protective sleeve 115 is not necessary here. It can still be ensured by the<br>
fixing of the two electrodes 3, 4 that also the inrer electrode 4 is not led too close towards vein<br>
100.<br>
Other arrangements of the electrodes 3, 4, 5 are obviously also possible. For example, fig. 3d<br>
shows an arrangement in which the activity region 6 is limited to the region in which the two<br>
electrodes 3, 4 come closest to each other. This is advantageous for very selective devices for<br>
example in which the surgeon can precisely define the place of coagulation by turning the<br>
coagulation and cutting unit 1. In other arrangements it is also possible to provide further<br>
electrodes 5 in addition to the two electrodes 3, 4, as a result of which the coagulation region can<br>
be changed, and in particular enlarged.<br>
The electrodes 3, 4, 5 can be carried in the presented coagulation and cutting unit 1 by a<br>
longitudinal basic body 2.<br>
Figs. 4a to 4k show advantageous embodiments cf the vein stripper in accordance with the<br>
invention. For this purpose the electrodes 3, 4, 5 can be attached to the first face side 2a of the<br>
basic body 2 in such a way that the axes of symmetry 3', 4' of the electrodes 3, 4, 5 extend<br>
substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis 2' of the basic body 2. As a result of this<br>
arrangement it is ensured that when the basic body 2 is moved in the illustrated manner or in the<br>
pulling direction 113 along the vein 100 or its central line 100', the electrodes 3, 4, 5 will be<br>
aligned in the aforementioned manner (especially figs. 3a to 3d) relative to vein 100.<br>
The basic body 2 as illustrated in fig. 4a is formed in the form of a web having a handle 7. The<br>
electrodes 3, 4, 5 are situated in the illustrated embodiment (in analogy to the arrangement<br>
shown in fig. 3c) in one and the same plane which extends substantially normal to the<br><br>
ngitudinal axis 2' of the basic body 2. Configurations of the electrodes 3, 4, 5 according to figs.<br>
3a, 3b, 3d or the like are possible.<br>
The electrodes 3, 4, 5 are connected via electric leads 3a, 4a with a power supply source 37,<br>
which is shown in fig. 4f for example.<br>
The basic body 2 as illustrated in fig. 4b has a substantially cylindrical shape. Annular electrodes<br>
3, 4, 5 are attached to the first face side 2a of the basic body 2, which electrodes 3, 4, 5 are<br>
connected on their part via electric lines 3a, 4a with the power supply source 37. The axes of<br>
symmetry 3', 4' of the electrodes 3, 4, 5 also extend substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis<br>
2' of the basic body 2.<br>
The cylindrical shape allows slipping the coagulation and cutting unit 1 over the vein 100. The<br>
cylindrical shape of the basic body 2 as shown in fig. 4b allows further that the coagulation and<br>
cutting unit 1 can be guided along the vein 100.<br>
At the same time, the basic body 2 is configured on its second face side 2b in such a way that it<br>
can be placed on a conventional end piece 111 of a vein stripper.<br>
During the vein stripping, it is thus possible, after slipping the coagulation and cutting unit 1 over<br>
the exposed end of the section 102 of vein 100 to be removed in the region 103 (cf. fig. 1b) and<br>
after threading the probe 110 into the vein 100 in the known manner, to attach an end piece 111<br>
to the probe 110 and to pull out the vein in the pulling direction 113.<br>
In contrast to known methods, all venous side branches 101 are cut off and coagulated in this<br>
process by the coagulation and cutting unit 1 in accordance with the invention before said side<br>
branches can tear off with the aforementioned disadvantages.<br>
The fact is especially advantageous in connection with the described embodiment that the<br>
coagulation and cutting unit 1 can be used with conventional vein strippers.<br>
Fig. 4c shows a further embodiment in which the basic body 2 is arranged merely by means of<br>
two webs 20a, 20b and the face-side rings 21a, 21b. Appropriately, the electric leads 3a, 4a are<br>
guided over the webs 20a, 20b. An embodiment with merely one web 20a is obviously also<br>
possible.<br><br>
This form of the basic body 2 ensures that the substantially cylindrical envelope which is created<br>
by the basic body 2 is nearly wholly passable in contrast to the embodiment shown in fig. 3b.<br>
This is advantageous in vein stripping in connection with the formation of folds as described<br>
above. The withdrawal of the vein 100 from the connective tissue 105 leads in the region 114<br>
upstream of the end piece 111 regularly to a bulging of the vein 100. The embodiment as shown<br>
in fig. 4c allows the vein to expand in a sufficient way and over the cylindrical space as<br>
encompassed by the basic body 2. In comparison with the embodiment with an enclosed cylinder,<br>
this configuration allows providing a much shorter basic body 2 without the bulging of the vein<br>
100 leading to any blockages of the basic body 2.<br>
Conventional vein strippers can be used in this case too.<br>
Intermediate forms are also possible which are situated from a constructional viewpoint between<br>
the embodiments shown in fig. 4b and fig. 4c. It is possible for example to merely provide a<br>
number of larger recesses in the cylindrical jacket surface of the basic body 2. The coagulation<br>
and cutting unit 1 can thus be optimized in this way with respect to length and stiffness. A<br>
necessary precondition for the use of the coagulation and cutting unit 1 for the stripping of veins<br>
is merely that the bulging of the vein 100 in the region 114 does not extend in the pulling<br>
direction 113 before the electrodes 3, 4, 5. In this case it would no longer be possible to securely<br>
coagulate and cut the side branches 101.<br>
In the illustration of fig. 4d a holding apparatus 8 is attached to the second face side 2b of the<br>
basic body 2. It is used for receiving and fixing the end 110a of a probe 110. As a result, the end<br>
piece 111 is integrated in the basic body 2. Handling is thus simplified even further, since it is<br>
not necessary to attach any separate end piece 111. After threading the probe 110 through the<br>
exposed vein 100, merely the coagulation and cutting unit 1 in accordance with the invention is<br>
slipped over the vein 100 and the end 110a of the probe 110 is fixed to the basic body 2 or the<br>
holding apparatus 8.<br>
The holding apparatus 8 is preferably similarly arranged for this puipose like known end pieces<br>
111 of conventional vein strippers. In particular, it comprises a slot 8a through which the probe<br>
110 can be inserted. It further comprises a recess S'b for receiving the end 110a of the probe 110<br>
and a web 8c which prevents a slippage through of the end 110a (fig. 4e).<br><br>
The illustrated embodiment facilitates the operation during the vein stripping; it can be prevented<br>
in particular that the basic body 2 is slipped over the vein 100 in the wrong direction.<br>
The embodiment as shown in fig. 4f offers the connection of the electrodes 3, 4, 5 to the power<br>
supply source 37 via the probe 110. A separate cable is no longer necessary which either needs to<br>
be guided through the vein 100 prior to vein stripping or needs to be entrained during the<br>
extraction of the vein 100 through the connective tissue 105.<br>
It can be provided for this purpose that the holding apparatus 8 comprises two contacts 9a, 9b<br>
which are electrically conductively connected with the electrodes 3, 4. 5. A special probe 110' is<br>
further provided into which two electric lines 3a and 4a are molten. The probe 110' also<br>
comprises two contacts 10a, 10b at its end 110a'. After threading the probe 110' through the vein<br>
100, the coagulation and cutting unit 1 is connected with the end 110a' of the probe 110' in a<br>
similar manner as shown in the embodiment as shown in fig. 4d. The contact is made in this case<br>
however between the contacts 9a, 9b and 10a, 10b, as a result of which the annular electrodes 3,<br>
4, 5 are connected via the probe 110' with the power supply source 37.<br>
Preferably, the probe 110' is provided at both ends 110a' and 110b' with electrodes 10a, 10b and<br>
a handle 112' is further provided, which produces an electric connection to the electric leads 3a,<br>
4a in an analogous manner. The handle 112' also comprises electrodes in this case which are<br>
connected with the leads leading to the power supply source 37. Vein stripping is especially<br>
simple in this last described embodiment. After threading the probe 110' through the vein 100<br>
and after the placement of the coagulation and cutting unit 1 and the handle 112' on both ends<br>
110a' and 110b', which handle is connected with the power supply source 37, the electrodes 3,4,<br>
5 are connected with the power supply source 37 via the handle 112' and the probe 110'. The<br>
vein 100 can thus be extracted, with all venous side branches 101 being severed by the electrodes<br>
3, 4, 5 with a high degree of certainty.<br>
The vein stripper in accordance with fig. 4g corresponds to the one shown in fig. 4a, with the<br>
probe 110 being introduced into the vein 100 prior to stripping in order to guide the coagulation<br>
and cutting unit 1. It can thus be prevented that the vein 100 is severed, so that the vein stripper<br>
according to fig. 4g in accordance with the invention also comprises a probe. The guidance of the<br>
coagulation and cutting unit 1 is ensured by the guide ring 2d, thus ensuring that the coagulation<br>
and cutting unit 1 is guided around the vein.<br><br>
Fig. 4h shows a vein stripper in accordance with the invention which comprises a drive apparatus<br>
22. It can comprise wheels 22 or the like in particular. Due to the drive apparatus 22, the<br>
coagulation and cutting unit 1 can move along the probe 110 and thus sever the vein 100 from<br>
the connective tissue 105 and the venous side branches 101. No additional thrusting and/or<br>
pulling apparatuses are necessary in this embodiment.<br>
The vein strippers in accordance with the invention and according to figs. 4g and 4h come with<br>
the advantage that the vein 100 can be severed in a first step from the connective tissue 105 and<br>
the venous side branches 101 and only in a second step will the vein 100 be removed. It is thus<br>
no longer necessary that the coagulation and cutting unit 1 comprises regions for receiving the<br>
already stripped vein 100, because the same remains unchanged in the body, thus leading to<br>
small overall sizes for the vein strippers in accordance with the invention.<br>
In the vein strippers 1 according to the invention and according to figs. 4i to 4k the probe 110" is<br>
arranged as an electrode 4. One electrode 3 on the coagulation and cutting unit 1 is thus already<br>
sufficient for achieving the cutting and coagulation effect. As a result of the substantially annular<br>
arrangement of the electrode 3 on the coagulation and cutting unit 1 it is ensured that the cutting<br>
and coagulation can occur in all directions. In order to improve the properties of the coagulation<br>
and cutting unit 1, further electrodes 5 can also be provided in the embodiments according to figs.<br>
4i to 4k.<br>
In the embodiments in which the probe 110, 110', 110" can be moved jointly with the<br>
coagulation and cutting unit 1 during the stripping, the probe 110, 110', 110" can also be<br>
integrally connected with the coagulation and cut ling unit 1.<br>
It has been seen that during the operation the vein stripper mostly needs to be pulled back several<br>
times by a bit. This can occur by pulling the electric leads 3a, 4a which are connected to the<br>
electrodes 3, 4, 5 or a cable enclosing the same when the leads 3a, 4a or the cable are led out at<br>
the second face surfaces 2b of the basic body 2. If the cable is fastened in an eccentric way to the<br>
basic body 2, a tilting of the coagulation and cutting unit 1 can occur in the channel. The leads 3a,<br>
4a are therefore led away from the second face surfaces 2b of the basic body 2 in a further<br>
advantageous embodiment as shown in figs. 5a to 5d.<br>
The coagulation and cutting unit 1 as shown in figs. 5a to 5d comprises several further electrodes<br>
5 in the region of the first face surface 2a of the basic body 2, which further electrodes<br><br>
abstantially overlap with the electrodes 3, 4. In particular, their axes of symmetry 5' extend<br>
substantially parallel to the axes of symmetry 3', 4' of the other electrodes 3, 4. The surfaces<br>
opened by the electrodes 3, 4, 5 substantially overlap each other when viewing in the axial<br>
direction of the axes of symmetry 3', 4', 5.<br>
As is shown in the drawing, the further electrodes 5 can be attached to the outer wall surface 2c<br>
of the basic body 2 or also to the inner wall surface.<br>
It is obvious that further electrodes can be provided directly on the first face surface 2a of the<br>
basic body 2.<br>
By using several electrodes 3, 4, 5 further activity regions 6 are obtained in which the severed<br>
venous side branches 101 can be coagulated in addition. This is especially advantageous for<br>
controlling the hemorrhage, because by a repeated coagulation of the already severed open end<br>
of a vein branch it is possible to achieve the best possible hemorrhage stoppage. This is often<br>
necessary in the case of very thick or also very thin or brittle vein branches in which otherwise<br>
occasional hemorrhages might occur again. If the coagulation and cutting unit 1 is provided with<br>
additional electrodes 5 on the side surfaces 2c of the basic body 2, the ends of the problematic<br>
venous side branches 101 are automatically coagulated several times, thus achieving a complete<br>
stoppage of the hemorrhage.<br>
The additional ring electrodes 5 can be placed via separate lines on a specific potential or be<br>
connected with the other electrodes 3, 4, 5. The first case offers the possibility of separately<br>
setting the difference in potential for all activity regions 6. In the latter case all electrodes 3, 4, 5<br>
can advantageously be supplied via the two lines 3a, 4a. The electrodes 3, 4, 5 of the coagulation<br>
and cutting unit 1 as shown in figs. 5a to 5d are all connected via lines 3a, 4a and altematingly<br>
have the polarities of the line 3a and line 4a.<br>
Different differences in potential between the electrodes 3, 4, 5 can be achieved by different<br>
distances between the electrodes 3, 4, 5 and/or by the connection of at least one of the electrodes<br>
3, 4, 5 with a resistor or the like. Suitable resistors are in addition to ohmic resistors especially<br>
reactive impedances.<br>
The basic body 2 is arranged by means of a single wide web 20a, thus providing sufficient space<br>
for the formation of folds of the vein wall.<br><br>
In the region of the second face surface 2b the basic body 2 comprises a slot 8a provided in the<br>
side wall 2c as well as a recess 8b, with the recess 8b being narrowed by a web 8c on its side<br>
facing the first face side 2b of the basic body 2. It is used as a holding apparatus 8 for receiving<br>
and fixing the end 1 la of a probe 110. The illustrated holding apparatus 8 in which the recess 8b<br>
comprises an extension 8d on its side facing the first face side 2b of the basic body 2 allows a<br>
simple interlocking connection between the basic body 2 and the head-like end 110a of the probe<br>
110. After the insertion of the probe 110 or its end 110a into the region of the slot 8a or the<br>
recess 8b, the end 110a of the probe can be fixed by withdrawal in the pulling direction 113 in<br>
the extension 8d.<br>
By providing the holding apparatus 8 in the side wall 2c, the leads 3a, 4a can be guided away<br>
from the second face surface 2b in a centric manner. The coagulation and cutting unit 1 can thus<br>
be pulled back and forth in the vein channel very easily by the leads 3a, 4a and the probe 110.<br>
Especially in the case that the leads 3a, 4a are guided within the probe 110' there is the<br>
possibility to fix an additional drainage tube 36 to the second face surface 2b, as is shown in fig.<br>
4f. Said drainage tube or redon tube 36 is usually introduced into the strip channel after the<br>
completed extraction of the vein in order to absorb additional tissue liquid. The provision of a<br>
coagulation and cutting unit 1 with a fixed redon tube 36 facilitates the introduction of said tube<br>
36, because the redon tube 36 is introduced automatically into the vein channel with the removal<br>
of the vein 100. On the other hand, the vein stripper in accordance with the invention can be<br>
pulled back and forth in the vein channel by the redon or drainage tube 36 in the case that the<br>
leads 3a, 4a are guided within the probe 110' and the basic body can no longer be withdrawn by<br>
leads 3a, 4a. The fixing of the drainage tube 36 can occur in different ways by welding or<br>
clamping for example. Advantageously, a separate holding apparatus 35 is provided on the basic<br>
body 2 by means of which the drainage tube 36 can be fixed. This offers the possibility of<br>
performing the operation on one leg, leaving the first redon tube 36 in the first vein channel,<br>
fixing a further redon tube 36 with the holding apparatus 35 on the basic body 2 and repeating<br>
the operation on the second leg. In other embodiments of the vein stripper in accordance with the<br>
invention the leads 3a, 4a can be guided within the redon tube 36.<br>
Fig. 5e shows the side view of a further embodiment of the coagulation and cutting unit 1 with a<br>
longitudinal slitting apparatus 25, shown in a sectional view. It comprises the longitudinal<br>
slitting apparatus 25 in addition to the embodiment according to figs. 5a to 5d.<br><br>
The longitudinal slitting apparatus 25 is used for slitting open the vein 100 during the stripping in<br>
the longitudinal direction. The slit region of the vein 100 can be guided about the second face<br>
side 2b of the coagulation and cutting unit 1. That is why the coagulation and cutting unit 1 can<br>
be pulled with the probe 110, 110', 110" through the stripping channel, with the vein 100<br>
remaining in the strip channel and being removed from the strip channel only after a further step.<br>
When removing the vein 100, a redon tube can be introduced into the strip channel. In this<br>
procedure it is not necessary that the vein stripper in accordance with the invention needs to<br>
receive the already stripped region of vein 100, thus allowing smaller overall sizes of the vein<br>
stripper to be achieved.<br>
The longitudinal slitting of the vein 100 can occur by means of a mechanical blade or by means<br>
of a slitting electrode. Cutting can occur in bipolar or monopolar fashion with the slitting<br>
electrode. In the case of a bipolar arrangement of the slitting electrode one of the further<br>
electrodes 5 can be used as a counter-electrode. In the case of a monopolar slitting electrode the<br>
required output for the cutting and coagulation of the vein 100 and the longitudinal slitting can<br>
be set independent of each other.<br>
In the embodiment according to fig. 5e the longitudinal slitting apparatus 25 is connected with<br>
the coagulation and cutting unit 1. This allows connecting the slitting electrode with one of the<br>
electric leads 3a, 4a. The provision of a separate electric line has proven to be advantageous<br>
especially in the case of a monopolar slitting electrode.<br>
The longitudinal slitting of the vein 100 is especially ensured in cases when the longitudinal<br>
slitting apparatus 25 is connected both with the coagulation and cutting unit 1 as well as with the<br>
probe 110, 110', 110". It can be provided for this purpose that the probe 110, 110', 110"<br>
comprises a groove or the like into which the longitudinal slitting apparatus 25 can be latched.<br>
According to another embodiment of the vein stripper in accordance with the invention which is<br>
shown in fig. 5f, the longitudinal slitting apparatus 25 can be fixed in the holding apparatus 8 by<br>
means of a nose 38a and comprise a further holding apparatus 38 for receiving and fixing the end<br>
110a, 110a', 110b' ofthe probe 110, 110', 110". In this embodiment the longitudinal slitting<br>
apparatus 25 can be introduced between the probe 110, 110', 110" and the holding apparatus 8 of<br>
the coagulation and cutting unit 1, thus leading to a modular arrangement. This configuration of<br><br>
longitudinal slitting apparatus 25 can be connected integrally with the coagulation and<br>
cutting unit 1.<br>
As a result of the arrangement of the electrodes 3, 4, 5, the shown embodiments lead to the<br>
consequence that the activity region 6 extends substantially over the entire circumference of the<br>
basic body. This property can also be achieved with a plurality of further electrode shapes.<br>
For example, the electrodes 3, 4, 5 can be provided with interruptions in sections, as indicated in<br>
fig. 6a. This offers the additional possibility to extend the electrodes 3, 4, 5 in a spiral fashion.<br>
Fig. 6b shows the coagulation and cutting unit 1, in which two of the electrodes 3, 4, 5 are<br>
extended in a spiral way over a longer region of the basic body 2. A larger activity region 6 is<br>
thus obtained.<br>
In the embodiment as shown in fig. 6c the electrodes 3, 4, 5 comprise fan-like fingers 10. This<br>
also leads to the possibility to enlarge the activity region 6.<br>
In addition to the stripping of veins 100, the vein stripper in accordance with the invention can<br>
also be used for stripping other tube- and/or pipe-like tissue parts or the like. For example, a<br>
section of an esophagus could be stripped with the vein stripper in accordance with the invention.<br>
The vein stripper as shown in fig. 7 comprises outlet openings 30 for an ionizable gas, with the<br>
use of argon being provided in particular as the ionizable gas. The outlet openings 30 are<br>
preferably arranged around the entire circumference of the vein stripper in accordance with the<br>
invention. It is possible to provide a plurality of outlet openings 30 or a substantially ring-like<br>
outlet opening. It has proven to be advantageous to provide the electrodes 3, 4, 5 with the same<br>
polarity with the outlet openings 30, with the electrodes 3, 4, 5 of the other polarity being<br>
arranged adjacent to the electrodes 3, 4, 5 with the outlet openings 30.<br>
It may occur in the vein stripper in accordance with the invention when no ionizable gas is used<br>
that the coagulated crust of one of the side branches will stick to the electrode 3, 4, 5 and the<br>
crust will break open through the movement of the vein stripper and the side branch will begin to<br>
hemorrhage again. A complete coagulation of the side branches can be achieved by pulling the<br>
vein stripper through several times even without using ionizable gas.<br><br>
when ionizable gas is used, it flows out of the outlet openings 30 and forms a gas cushion via the<br>
electrode 3, 4, 5 with the outlet openings 30. When the gas cushion touches one of the electrodes<br>
3, 4, 5 with another polarity, then the gas ionizes and becomes conductive, with the gas heating<br>
up and becoming plasma-like. The tissue contacting the gas cushion is coagulated by the same.<br>
There is no direct contact of the tissue with one of the electrodes 3, 4, 5 and therefore the crusts<br>
cannot stick to the electrodes 3, 4, 5.<br>
In order to ensure that the coagulation occurs by the heat of the plasma-like ionized gas and not<br>
directly on the electrodes 3, 4, 5, the electrodes 3. 4, 5 with the outlet openings 30 can be offset<br>
to the rear relative to the adjacent electrodes 3, 4, 5, thus ensuring the formation of the gas<br>
cushion of plasma-like gas via the electrodes 3, 4. 5 with the outlet openings 30. Said gas<br>
cushion which can be annular in particular produces the coagulation and simultaneously prevents<br>
the direct contact of the tissue to be coagulated with the electrodes 3, 4, 5.<br>
If the gas cushion has direct contact with only one of the electrodes 3, 4, 5, the contact with one<br>
of the electrodes 3, 4, 5 with another polarity can also occur indirectly via the tissue. The gas<br>
between the electrode 3, 4, 5 with the outlet openings 30 and the body tissue will ionize, with the<br>
gas heating up again and becoming plasma-like, as a result of which the tissue will coagulate.<br>
This case can occur in particular when the gas pressure is very low, the edges of the adjacent<br>
electrodes are soiled and/or much bodily liquid impinges upon the surfaces of the electrodes 3, 4,<br>
5.<br>
When the electrodes 3, 4, 5 are offset to the rear only slightly, it can be ensured that in the event<br>
of failure of the gas stream the tissue to be coagulated comes into direct contact with the<br>
electrodes 3, 4, 5 and there is a coagulation as in a vein stripper in accordance with the invention<br>
without support by ionizable gas.<br>
The vein stripper in accordance with the invention and in accordance with fig. 8 comprises two<br>
suction openings 40 in the region of the holding apparatus 8 by means of which the smoke<br>
produced during coagulation can be removed. Another number of suction openings 40 can also<br>
be provided in other embodiments. The arrangement of the suction opening 40 in the region of<br>
the holding apparatus 8 comes with the advantage that the configuration of the electrodes 3, 4, 5<br>
can occur independent of the configuration of the suction openings 40. The immediate removal<br>
of smoke after its production can be ensured by the suction openings 40.<br><br>
one suction openings 40 can also be arranged in the web 20a.<br>
Figs. 9a to 9e show a further embodiment of the vein stripper in accordance with the invention<br>
which comprises outlet openings 30 and suction openings 40.<br>
The sectional views as shown in figs. 9d and 9e show that one of the electrodes 3, 4, 5 comprises<br>
a tubular region 11. The tubular region comprises a large contact surface, thus improving the<br>
conductive connection between the tubular region 11 and the tissue.<br>
Figs. 9d and 9e show further that the outlet openings 30 are connected to a gas connection 32 by<br>
means of a gas conduit 31. The gas connection 32 can be arranged on the second face side 2b of<br>
the basic body 2. The gas supply line can then be guided parallel to the electric leads 3a, 4a or be<br>
connected to the same.<br>
The suction openings 40 are connected with the suction connection 42 by means of suction bores<br>
41, which connection is preferably also arranged on the second face side 2b of the basic body 2.<br>
A suction line can then also be guided parallel to the electric lines 3a, 4a or be connected with<br>
the same. The electric leads 3 a, 4a, the gas supply line and the suction line can be guided in a<br>
common tube or the like.<br>
An annular ultrasonic resonator 50 is arranged in the region of the electrodes 3, 4, 5 in the<br>
embodiment of the vein stripper in accordance with the invention as shown in fig. 10, which<br>
resonator is arranged as a cutting unit. The electrodes 3, 4, 5 form the coagulation unit. The<br>
cutting process and the coagulation process are realized differently in this arrangement, thus<br>
enabling a separate control of the two processes in a very simple manner.<br>
A longitudinal slitting apparatus 25 can also be provided in the embodiments according to figs. 7<br>
to 10. Furthermore, the ultrasonic resonator 50 and'or the suction opening 40 and/or the outlet<br>
openings 30 can be provided in all embodiments.<br><br>
