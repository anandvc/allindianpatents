Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an enhanced apparatus and a method for treating sludge, which is designed and manufactured so that in order to remove nutritional salt material such as nitrogen and phosphorus, which is included in foul water or wastewater sludge thereby causing eutrophication, foul water or wastewater is sedimented in a first sedimentation tank and sedimented product is concentrated; the foul water or wastewater solution at the top is transferred to a biological reactor and microorganisms are poured thereto for microorganisms to remove a nutrient material and phosphorus and nitrogen that are eutriphication material; a solution containing sludge treated biologically is transferred to a second sedimentation tank, and supernatant is disinfected and then discharged, and sedimented product is concentrated together with the sediment of the first sedimentation tank by employing a concentration tank or a dewatering device; concentrated sludge is dewatered with a first dewatering device to lower the amount of sludge and then dewatered sludge is passed through a thermal hydrolysis reactor to hydrolyze hydrolyze polymers including protein, carbohydrate and lipid, contained in dewatered sludge, thereby discharging phosphorus and nitrogen contained by microorganisms in some extent; phosphorus and nitrogen contained by microorganisms are discharged on digestion in an anaerobic digester properly controlling supply of nutrient source, temperature and pH; digested sludge is dewatered with a dewatering device; dewatered sludge is transferred to a crystallization reactor that a crystallization material is poured to form MAP struvite crystal product or various crystal products in order to remove nutrient salt material such as phosphorus and nitrogen, and at least one crystallized material selected from magnesium, potassium, zinc, calcium carbonate, phosphoric acid and calcium is poured to remove by crystallization; and a remaining solution after crystallization is fed back to a step prior to the biological reactor or the digester thereby being removed again through enhanced treatment process.<br>
Since the solution passed through the dewatering device 17 contains phosphorus and nitrogen, crystallization reactor 18 is set next to the second dewatering device 17 in order to remove phosphorus and nitrogen efficiently through a step for crystallizing them into the MAP struvite crystal product. Crystallization material 27 of Mg2+ or Mg2+ and PO43 is poured into the crystallization reactor 18 in a certain quantity to crystallize into MAP(Mg2+NH4+P043"), and then the crystallized product is discharged outside to store at a reservoir 22 for crystallized products for use as good fertilizer. An aqueous solution remaining after crystallization step is recycled to a step prior to the biological reactor 12 or the digester to remove again sludge, phosphorus and nitrogen. These steps are repeated in certain times.<br>
Since the crystaflizafion reactor 18 depends greatly on the pouring amount of Mg2+ or Mg2+ and PC**3, pH and reaction time, etc., optimum reaction condition must be satisfied in order to achieve efficient crystallization reaction. In order to achieve efficient reaction in the crystallization reactor 18, when the pouring molar ratio of Mg2+: NH/: PO43" is adjusted to 1.0 to 1.4: 0.8 to 1.0 to 1.4, and crystallization reactor is maintained under pH of alkaline 9 to 12, crystallization efficiency becomes greatly high thereby achieving efficient crystallization and elevating treatment speed due to rapid reaction.<br>
Further, the present invention also relates to an advanced method for treating sludge wherein biological reaction step is performed so that phosphorus and nitrogen are removed by employing microorganisms; dewatering step is performed to lower the percentage of moisture content of the sludge in which microorganisms containing phosphorus and nitrogen are included; dewatered sludge resulting from dewatering step is subjected to thermal hydrolysis step to decompose the polymers present in a solution; the resulting product is transferred to an anaerobic digester and subjected to digestion step to digest organic sludge; the sludge after digestion step is subjected to dewatering, and thus nitrogen and phosphorus present in some microorganisms are incinerated, carbonized, melted, or solidified to a fertilizer as dewatered cakes having the percentage of moisture content below 70% together with microorganisms; since the solution discharged during dewatering contains much phosphorus and nitrogen because microorganisms alive in the digestion step discharge phosphorus and nitrogen<br><br>
during digestion in an anaerobic digester, the solution is transferred to crystallization reactor 18 to remove phosphorus and nitrogen present in the solution, and Mg2+ or Mg2+ and PO43 is poured into the crystallization reactor in a certain quantity to crystallize, and then the MAP converted to struvite crystal product is transferred to a reservoir 22 for crystallized products for use as good fertilizer; a solution generated during crystallization step is recycled to a step prior to the biological reactor or the digester to remove phosphorus and nitrogen again.<br>
Mode for the Invention<br>
Embodiments of the present invention will be described based on the drawings. FIG. 1 depicts a whole construction of an advanced apparatus for treating sludge according to the present invention. FIG. 2 depicts another whole construction of an advanced apparatus for treating sludge according to the present invention.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention and another embodiment thereof, dewatering device 14, 17 is made up of one selected from a belt press, a filter press, and a dewatering device and a centrifuge employing air pressure.<br>
A solution exited on concentration or dewatering is fed back to any step of prior end to retreat, or is purified and then disinfected to discharge.<br>
Hereinafter, construction elements according to the present invention are described in more detail. In general, since phosphorus and nitrogen are present in the amount of about hundreds to thousands mg per one liter in usual sludge contained in sewage sludge, food waste and livestock excretion, etc., the usual sludge greatly influences eutrophication of a river and a seawater. In particular, significantly high concentrations of phosphorus and nitrogen are contained in pig excretion.<br>
The biological reactor 12 is constructed so that microorganisms may eat out BOD load material, which is nutrient source contained in foul water or wastewater inlet 10, and phosphorus and nitrogen, which are eutrophication sources. Phosphorus gone into a microorganism is partly removed together with the microorganism during dewatering with a dewatering device 17; however, since a usual apparatus for treating sludge discharges phosphorus, which microorganisms contain, during a digestion step in an anaerobic digester 16, and thus phosphorus and nitrogen are present together with nitrogen added from microorganisms in a solution exited from the dewatering device 17 during a step for treating dewatered cake 21.<br>
Since the solution passed through the dewatering device 17 contains phosphorus and nitrogen, crystallization reactor 18 is set next to the second dewatering device 17 in order to remove phosphorus and nitrogen efficiently through a step for crystallizing them into MAP. Crystallization material 27 of Mg2+ or Mg2* and PO43 is poured into the crystallization reactor 18 in a certain quantity to crystallize into MAP(Mg2+NrVP043"), and then the crystallized product is discharged outside to store at a reservoir 22 for crystallized products for use as good fertilizer. An aqueous solution remaining after crystallization step is recycled to a step prior to the biological reactor 12 or the digester to remove again sludge, phosphorus and nitrogen. These steps are repeated in certain times.<br>
An enhanced apparatus for treating foul water or wastewater siudge can be constructed by further including a usual incineration apparatus for incinerating cake dewatered with the dewatering device 17, or a high temperature melt processing apparatus for melt processing the cake.<br>
An enhanced apparatus for treating foul water or wastewater sludge can be constructed by further including an apparatus selected from a usual sludge solidifying apparatus for solidifying the cake dewatered with the dewatering device 17 in order to use as a cover soil material, a usual sludge carbonizing apparatus for carbonizing in order to recycle as an industrial material, and a usual sludge dryer for drying in order to use as a fuel.<br>
In the apparatus according to the present invention, a step for incinerating or melting the cake dewatered with the dewatering device can be further included, and a step selected from a step for solidifying the dewatered cake in order to use as a cover soil material, a step for carbonizing in order to recycle the cake as an industrial material. and a step for drying the cake in order to use as a fuel can be further included.<br>
The crystallization step can enhance crystallization efficiency and reaction speed when a crystal core is poured in proper quantity. An example of the crystal core includes pre-crystallized struvite sludge. Struvite sludge is a crystallized body bound in molar ratio of Mg2+: NH/: PO43" = 1:1:1, and is in general said as the MAP struvite crystal product.<br><br>
The form of its solid state is present as two types, i.e., MgNHiPO^MAP) or MgNH4P04 - H2CX.MAP Hydrate). The MAP is used as a fertilizer for gardening, a seedling, a golf course and various soils.<br>
Mg can be poured in the state of MgO, MgOH or MgS04 ■ H2O . In order to increase crystallinity, PO43" can be poured using KH2PO4.<br>
The apparatus is constructed so that its dewatering efficiency can be elevated through hydrolyzing microorganism cells contained in sludge and chain-form polymers by heating them for 30 minutes to one hour under the condition of the inside temperature of the heat hydrolysis reactor 15 at 150°C to 250°C and the pressure at 3 to 12 bars; then digesting the resulting product in the digester 16; and then dewatering the product with the dewatering device 17. The apparatus can be constructed so that it has preheating pretreatment step before dewatered sludge is transferred to thermal hydrolysis reaction 15 by setting control tank 23 after lowering the percentage of moisture content with the dewatering device 14.<br>
Energy can be saved by constructing the apparatus so that since the thermal hydrolysis reactor 15 requires heat of 150°C to 250°C and the digester next to the reactor 15 must be maintained below 40°C, a heat recovery tank 24 is set between the thermal hydrolysis reactor and the digester in order to recycle the heat of the thermal hydrolysis reactor 15, and the recovered heat can be employed in maintaining the preheating pretreatment step of the at least one control tank 23 and/or the digester 16 at a constant temperature. Since the thermal hydrolysis reactor 15 discharges, in some extent, phosphorus and nitrogen which microorganisms absorbed during thermal hydrolysis reaction, phosphorus and nitrogen are present in the sludge.<br>
The digester 16 according to the present invention can be constructed so that the sludge having a temperature of 35aC to 4O0C suitable to mesophilic or thermophilic digestion produces a fatty acid or a volatile acid by microorganisms such as bacteria contained in the sludge with employing nutrients and energy sources which the sludge has; produced fatty acid lowers the quantity and odor of the sludge through a step for generating carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane gas (CH4); and the methane gas generated as a by-product is supplied as energy required to a boiler 19 for heating the thermal hydrolysis reactor 15 or used as an energy source of generating electricity or heating,<br>
The apparatus according to the present invention can be constructed so that a means for controlling feed of nutrient source to sludge, temperature and pH properly is included in order to effect digestion efficiently at the digester 16, equilibrium can be achieved on forming an acid and methane gas through such control, and a digestion sludge as an end product consists of volatile and non-volatile particles, and thus if dewatered, can increase the percentage of dewatering while not emitting special odor.<br>
The present invention can be designed and manufactured so that the sludge thermally-hydrolyzed in the thermal hydrolysis reactor 15 without performing digestion step employing the digester is passed through a dewatering device, and some sludge are treated as dewatered cakes, and the solution generated during dewatering is transferred to the crystallization reactor 18 to'crystallize and then remove phosphorus and nitrogen contained in the solution.<br>
Another enhanced apparatus for treating sludge according to the present invention can be designed and manufactured so that the sludge thermally-hydrolyzed in the thermal hydrolysis reactor 15 is transferred to the crystallization reactor 18 to crystallize and then remove phosphorus and nitrogen contained in the solution, the MAP struvite crystal product converted to solid by crystallization reaction in the crystallization reactor 18 is transferred to a reservoir 22 for crystallized product to store and use as good fertilizer, the solution generated in crystallization step is transferred to the digester to digest, and then dewatered with a dewatering device to form dewatered cake and remaining solution is fed back to prior step.<br>
Another enhanced apparatus for treating sludge according to the present invention can be designed and manufactured so that the solution generated in crystallization step is fed back to the digester, and the sludge passed through crystallization step and digestion step is dewatered to form sludge cake and remaining solution is fed back to prior step.<br>
An enhanced apparatus for treating usual sludge contained in sewage, food waste and livestock excretion according to the present invention can include a thermometer, a pressure gauge, a common sensor for monitoring the quantity of stored sludge and other necessary sensors required in each step so that each step can be controlled efficiently and automatically.<br><br>
An enhanced apparatus for treating foul water or wastewater sludge according to the present invention can include an apparatus control unit with a built-in PLC or microprocessor and memory, and control program in order to control efficiently engaged with valves and various sensors equipped to perform the multiple steps smoothly. The apparatus is constructed so that the apparatus control unit can be worked manually or automatically if needed engaged with a control button to work each step manually if needed, a pump to transfer sludge to necessary step according to the order, and valves that are set to a pipe, i.e., a side of a pipe to which sludge is transferred, and thus are opened and shut manually or automatically if needed.<br>
The apparatus control unit includes a display panel for user's convenience, and a means for monitoring whether each step is normally worked engaged with various sensors, or inputting a value required in control of each step, thereby setting and storing it.<br>
A sedimentation tank, a biological reactor, a dewatering device, a thermal hydrolysis reactor, a digester and a crystallization reactor that are employed in the enhanced apparatus for treating sludge according to the present invention can be equipped with multiple numbers in parallel, or with omitting unnecessary apparatus. The apparatus consists of biological reaction step, dewatering step, thermal hydrolysis step, digestion step and crystallization step of the enhanced method for treating sludge according to the present invention, but can include further intermediate steps if needed. For example, sedimentation step employing a sedimentation tank to sediment sludge and control step by equipping with a control tank for preheating pretreatment prior to thermal hydrolysis step can be further included, and some steps can be omitted if needed.<br>
