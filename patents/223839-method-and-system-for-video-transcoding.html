				<td>METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR VIDEO TRANSCODING<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[1001] The present disclosure relates generally to the processing of video data.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[1002] The use of digital video has proliferated, and is expected to continue proliferating as digital data<br>
processing and data transmission speeds increase. Modifying digital video from a digital video<br>
stream having one characteristic to a digital video stream having a different characteristic is referred<br>
to generally as video transcoding. Examples of different characteristics include protocol (e.g.<br>
MPEG1 and MPEG2) and data rates, such as affected by different quantization values. When all<br>
the video information of one video stream is maintained when transcoded to a different video<br>
stream lossless, transcoding is said to occur. For lossless transcoding to occur, it is necessary that<br>
the bandwidth available to the second video stream is sufficient to support the data present in the<br>
original video stream.<br>
[1003] Transcoders for transcoding between MPEG2 and MPEG4 are known and one such transcoder is<br>
described in United States Patent Number 6, 647, 061 (Panusopone et al.) which describes the<br>
recovery of header information of the input bit stream and the use of the input header information to<br>
develop header information for an output bit stream. The input bit stream is partially decompressed<br>
and is then recompressed using the output header information.<br>
[1004] Currently, lossless video transcoding between protocols is accomplished by decoding a first<br>
video stream having a first protocol to generate rendered data (image data), followed by encoding<br>
the rendered data to generate a second video data stream having a second protocol. Encoding using<br>
rendered data is a computationally intensive process. Therefore, a system and / or method of<br>
transcoding that reduces processing requirements needed for transcoding, and / or perform lossless<br>
transcoding would be useful.<br>
[1005] According to one aspect of the present invention, a method of video transcoding comprises<br>
receiving a first video data of a first type, wherein the first video data comprises compressed data<br>
that has been quantized, determining whether a DC quantization scalar of the first video data is a<br>
predetermined DC quantization scalar, and when the DC quantization scalar of the first video data<br>
is the predetermined DC scalar, scaling the compressed data to generate a scaled data and encoding<br>
the scaled data to generate a second video data of a second type.<br>
[1006] Preferably, the scaling the compressed data includes dequantizing the first video data to obtain<br>
the compressed data and scaling the compressed data using an AC quantization scalar.<br>
[1007] The method of the invention can be selectively used to obtain lossless transcoding of an intra<br>
frame where the first video data has a non-linear relationship between DC quantization scalar and<br>
AC quantization scalar and the second video data has a linear relationship between DC quantization<br>
scalar and AC quantization scalar.<br>
[1008] According to another aspect of the invention, a system for video transcoding comprises an input<br>
to receive a first video data of a first type, wherein the first video data comprises compressed data<br>
that has been quantized, a transcoder coupled to the input, the transcoder configured to scale the<br>
compressed data to generate a scaled data and encode the scaled data to generate a second video<br>
data when a DC quantization scalar of the first video data is a predetermined DC quantization<br>
scalar, and an output to provide the second video data.<br>
[1009] Preferably, the transcoder is further configured to dequantize the first video data to obtain the<br>
compressed data and to scale the compressed data using an AC quantization scalar.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT( S)<br>
[1018] Specific methods of transcoding video data are disclosed as well as a system of transcoding data.<br>
One method of transcoding video data generates a motion vector for a dual prime macro block<br>
having a motion vector and differential motion vector for its two fields respectively. Another<br>
method of transcoding includes replacing a skipped P-macroblock that has been used to backward<br>
predict a B-Frame with a P-macroblock having a motion vector of zero. Another method of<br>
transcoding video data includes replacing a skipped B-macroblock with a macroblock having a<br>
motion vector from a macroblock of the same frame of the skipped B-Macroblock that is not co-<br>
located. A system including an open loop transcoder and a closed loop transcoder is further<br>
disclosed. A method and system of implementing lossless quantization between video protocols in<br>
a scalar manner is also disclosed. FIGs. 2-13 better describe the various aspects of the present<br>
disclosure.<br>
[1019] FIG. 1 is used to identify, for purposes of clarity, the nomenclature used herein. Specifically,<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates five frames 102-106 of data that represent a group of video frames. Many<br>
encoding protocols, such as protocols known as MPEG2 and MPEG4, where MPEG is an acronym<br>
for Motion Picture Experts Group, compress video data by taking advantage of redundant image<br>
portions of adjacent frames. The sequential order of the reference numbers (102-106) indicates the<br>
order that the group of frames 102-106 need to be available for decoding. For example, frame 102<br>
needs to be available at a decoder before frame 103 can be decoded, and frame 103 needs to be<br>
available before frame 104 can be decoded, and so on.<br>
[1020] Frame 102 is an intra frame (I frame), frames 103, 104 and 106 are forwarded predicted frames<br>
(P frames), and frame 105 is a bi-directional predicted frames (B frame). Each of the frames are<br>
further represented by a frame identifier that includes a frame type (I, P, or B) and an integer suffix<br>
to indicate the display order of the specific frame relative to the other frames. Therefore, frame B3<br>
105 is displayed prior to frame P4 104, even though P4 104 is needed by a decoder before B3 105.<br>
[1021] Each frame 102-106 of video data comprises a plurality of macroblocks. Each macroblock in a<br>
frame has a corresponding image location where its data, if any, representing an image is to be<br>
displayed. For illustrative purposes, FIG. 1 represents a frame template 100 identifying image<br>
locations 00 through 99. Therefore, image location 22 has a screen location that is immediately<br>
adjacent horizontally to image locations 21 and 23. When discussing specific macroblocks of a<br>
frame, the frame identifier (I1, P2, P4, B3, P5) is further modified by appending the image location<br>
number after a slash "/". Therefore, the macroblock associated with image location 22 for frame P4<br>
104 would be referred to herein as macroblock P4 / 22 104, and the macroblock associated with<br>
image location 23, adjacent to macroblock 22, in frame P4 104 would be referred to as P4 / 23 104.<br>
Additional prefix and suffix information with respect to specific frames or macroblocks will be<br>
discussed as needed herein.<br>
[1022] FIG. 2 illustrates graphically, a representation of a first macroblock based data stream 109, such<br>
as a MPEG2 data stream, being converted to macroblock based data stream 110 having a different<br>
protocol, such as a MPEG4 data stream. Specifically, the MPEG2 stream portion 109 includes an I<br>
frame 116 followed by a P Frame 117. Note that macroblock location is not a consideration with<br>
respect to FIG. 2. The syntax contained within the parenthesis of frames 116 and 117 of the data<br>
stream 109 indicates that each macroblock of the frames 116 and 117 include an upper field data<br>
and a lower field data, which are also referred to as odd and even fields, respectively. Specifically,<br>
the syntax IO and IE refer to an odd image field texture and an even image field texture,<br>
respectively, for an I frame; PO and PE refer to an odd field texture or prediction data and an even<br>
field texture or prediction data, respectively, for a P frame; while MVo and MVe refer to an odd<br>
field motion vector and an even field motion vector, for a P frame.<br>
[1023] A specific mode of MPEG2 encoding is known as dual-prime mode. With dual prime mode<br>
encoding, either the odd or even field motion vectors associated with a P macroblock of data is a<br>
differential motion vector, designated dMV as opposed to a non-differential motion vector, or a<br>
direct motion vector. A differential motion vector can be combined with the non-differential<br>
motion vector of the other field of the same frame to generate a calculated motion vector,<br>
designated cMV in FIG. 2. Referring to FIG. 2, the P frame 117 includes a motion vector (MVo)<br>
for the odd field, and a differential motion vector (dMVe) for the even field.<br>
[1024] Dual-prime mode is not supported by the MPEG4 protocol. Therefore, in accordance with a<br>
specific embodiment of the present disclosure, the MPEG2 data stream 109 is modified to be<br>
MPEG4 compliant. In accordance with one embodiment of the disclosure, the MPEG2 stream 109,<br>
which has been encoded using dual-prime mode to have a differential motion vector (dMVe), is<br>
shown being converted to a MPEG4 compliant stream 110 that includes P-frame 112, which has<br>
two prediction fields (PO, PE), and two respective motion vectors (MVo, cMVe).<br>
[1025] As illustrated in FIG. 2, MPEG4 stream 110 differs from MPEG2 stream 109 in that the<br>
differential motion vector, dMVe associated with the even field, of the MPEG2 P-frame 117 has<br>
been replaced with a calculated motion vector cMVe. The calculated motion vector cMVe, as<br>
represented by equation 115, is determined based upon a combination of the motion vector for the<br>
other field in the macroblock, the odd field motion vector in this example, and a value represented<br>
by the differential motion vector (dMVe). By replacing the differential motion vectors with motion<br>
vector calculated in this manner, a compliant MPEG4 macroblock can be generated in a lossless<br>
manner.<br>
[1026] Another MPEG2 mode of operation that is not supported by MPEG4 deals with skipping of co-<br>
located P macroblocks. While both the MPEG2 and MPEG4 protocols allow for the skipping of<br>
macroblocks, i.e. no texture or motion vector data provided for a macroblock, skipping of a P frame<br>
macroblock in MPEG2 that is used along with a co-located B-macroblock to predict an image is<br>
permitted. However, when a P macroblock is skipped in MPEG4, the B macroblock is skipped as<br>
well. This can be better understood with reference to FIGs. 3 and 4.<br>
[1027] Referring to FIG. 3, specific macroblocks 121-124 are illustrated to represent a portion of an<br>
MPEG2 stream 120. The data stream 120 represents a specific image location of frame data that is<br>
generally received sequentially. For purposes of illustration, the macroblocks 121-123 are received<br>
in an order indicated by their reference numbers 121-124. Therefore, with respect to FIG. 3, the<br>
macroblock are received in the following order: I1-P2-P4-B3.<br>
[1028] The portion of the MPEG 2 stream 120 illustrated in FIG. 3 includes an I macroblock 121,<br>
associated with a frame identifier II; two P frame macroblocks 122 and 123, associated with frame<br>
identifiers P2 and P4, respectively; and a B frame macroblock 124, associated with a frame B3.<br>
The integer suffix of each frame identifier for macroblocks type 121-124 indicates the display order<br>
of each frame. For example, the macroblock II is to be displayed prior to the macroblock P2,<br>
which is to be displayed before the macroblock B3, which is to be displayed before the macroblock<br>
P4. It will be appreciated that the reception order of the frame data, that includes the macroblocks<br>
of stream 120, is not necessarily the same as the display order when B frames are used. A slash (/)<br>
and numeric indicator following the frame reference indicates the display location of the<br>
macroblock.<br>
[1029] The P and B macroblocks of FIG. 3 have motion vectors as indicated by the references MV in<br>
the parenthesis following the numeric indicator specifying the display location. For example, MV2<br>
is the motion vector associated with the P2 frame. A macroblock having an "s" prefix, such as for<br>
macroblock P2/22, is a skipped macroblock, which in reality has no texture or motion vector data.<br>
Because skipped macroblock sP2/22 122 is a previously decoded macroblock, and macroblock<br>
B3/22 124, is predicted relative to P4/22 123, stream 120 contains a MPEG2 protocol that is also<br>
valid in a MPEG4 stream protocol once any necessary quantization scaling is performed.<br>
[1030] Referring to FIG. 4, the skipped P macroblock P4/22 143, of stream 140, is coded with B<br>
macroblock B3/22 144 that has texture and or motion vector data. During MPEG2 decoding, the<br>
skipped macroblock data for sP4/22 143 is predicted from the rendered data associated with the co-<br>
located macroblock P2/22 142, and the macroblock B3/22 144 is rendered using the predicted data<br>
for P4/22 143 and the prediction error data and motion vector data of macroblock B3/22 144.<br>
However, MPEG4 requires a B macroblock to be skipped when the previously decoded collocated<br>
P macro-block that is to be displayed subsequent to the B macroblock is skipped and prohibits to<br>
encoding of any data for the said macroblock B3/22 144. FIG. 4 illustrates a non-lossless option for<br>
converting the MPEG2 stream to an MPEG4 stream by skipping the B macroblock B3/22 144 in<br>
the converted MPEG4 stream 150. However, since the data associated with the macroblock B3/22<br>
of stream 140 would not used, skipping the B3/22 macroblock in stream 150 results in a lossy<br>
solution relative to the MPEG2 stream.<br>
[1031] FIG. 5, provides a lossless MPEG2 to MPEG4 transcoding solution for an MPEG2 stream<br>
having a skipped P frame, displayed after a B-frame that is predicted based on the P-frame that is<br>
used by a co-located B frame. Specifically, the skipped MPEG2 macroblock sP4/22 163 is encoded<br>
in the MPEG4 stream 170 with relevant texture and motion vector. In one embodiment, the<br>
relevant texture is the predicted texture for skipped macroblock P4/22 163 in stream 160. Note that<br>
MPEG2 macroblock p4/22(P 160,0) 173 where the p160 designator indicates that macroblock P4/22<br>
includes the decoded texture data, for the skipped frame SP4 163 from stream 160, which is the<br>
same as the texture data from the previously decoded co-located macroblock, P2/22 172. The value<br>
"0" in the parenthesis of macroblock P4/22 173 indicates the motion vector is set to zero. In this<br>
manner, the data associated with the B macroblock 164 in MPEG2 stream 160 B3/22(MV3) 164<br>
can be duplicated, and used, in the MPEG4 stream 170, so that lossless transcoding is realized.<br>
[1032] FIG. 6 illustrates a MPEG2 stream 180 being converted to a MPEG4 stream 200. Specifically,<br>
the stream 180 illustrates a skipped B macroblock, sB3/22 184, that is portion of a B frame B3.<br>
Since MPEG4 does not treat the skipped B macro-block in the same way that MPEG2 does, an<br>
accommodation needs to be made to allow for a lossless conversion. As illustrated in FIG. 6,<br>
sB3/22 184 is replaced in the MPEG4 steam with B3/22(0, MV[B3/21]), where the prediction error<br>
data is set at zero, and the motion vector is set equal to the motion vector of a macroblock of the B-<br>
frame B3 that is not co-located with the macroblocks being decoded. For example, the motion<br>
vector of the previous macroblock B3/21 (not illustrated) of the same frame is used. Note that if the<br>
macroblock is being transcoded the first location of the B frame sequence, i.e. B3/00, a motion<br>
vector of zero (0) can be used. This results in a lossless transcoding since no new data was<br>
provided by the skipped B macroblock, and B macroblocks are not used for further prediction.<br>
[1033] FIG. 7 illustrates a method that can be used to transcode data streams supporting different<br>
quantization methods. The embodiment illustrated in FIG. 7 re-quantizes data from a mode<br>
compliant with MPEG2 to a mode compliant with MPEG4. Specifically, the method of FIG. 7 can<br>
be implemented in a scalar manner without decoding and encoding the data stream.<br>
[1034] MPEG4 allows the use of two quantization methods. One method is known as the MPEG2<br>
mode by the MPEG4 world, while the other is know as MPEG4, or MPEG4 mode. Although the<br>
default quantization matrices in use in the MPEG4 mode are different from the quantization method<br>
in use in the MPEG2 mode it is possible in MPEG4, as in MPEG2, to transmit specific matrices.<br>
The major difference between the MPEG2 mode and the MPEG4 mode comes from the way the<br>
DC sample in the intra block is processed.<br>
[1035] Specifically, the quantization step used in MPEG2 for processing the DC sample in the intra<br>
block lies in the range {8, 16, 32}, and is not dependent on the quantization step used to quantize<br>
the AC sample. This is not the case with MPEG4 mode, wherein the DC quantization step varies<br>
with the AC quantization step in a piecewise linear manner for AC quantized values greater than 4.<br>
This difference in the use of the DC sample with respect to the quantizing AC sample can prevent<br>
lossless transcoding of the intraframe that propagates an error to all subsequent frames based on the<br>
intraframe (group of pictures).<br>
[1036] One method of lossless transcoding from MPEG2 to MPEG4 is illustrated by the flow diagram<br>
of FIG. 7, and can be utilized when the MPEG2 quantization scale is equal to eight (8).<br>
[1037] At step 602, the value of the MPEG2 data DC quantization scalar (DC_Q_SCALE2) is<br>
determined. At step 611, a determination is made whether DCQSCALE2 is equal to 8. If so, an<br>
MPEG4 AC quantization scalar (AC_Q_SCALE4) can be used having a value of 1, 2, 3, or 4, as<br>
allowed by the MPEG4 DC Lookup table. If not, the scalor method of FIG. 7 cannot be used to<br>
requantize the MPEG2 data stream.<br>
[1038] At step 603, AC_Q_SCALE4 is determined by selecting a value of AC_Q_SCALE4 such that<br>
(AC_Q_SCALE2)/(AC_Q_SCALE4) = A, where AC_Q_SCALE2 is the AC quantization scalar of<br>
the MPEG2 data, and A is equal to a value of 1, 2, 3, and 4. By selecting ACQSCALE4 to<br>
maximize the value of A, greater compression will be realized on the transcoded stream.<br>
[1039] At step 604, the MPEG2 AC element F"[u][v] is dequantized to obtain F[u][v].<br>
[1040] At step 605, dequantized valued F[u][v] is scaled by A (F[u][v]*A) to obtain Fs[u][v].<br>
[1041] At step 606, scaled value Fs[u][v] is encoded using the AC_Q_SCALE4 value determined in<br>
step 603, and the value ACQSCALE4 is encoded as well in the MPEG4 data stream.<br>
[1042] The system illustrated in FIG. 10 allows for the lossless transcoding of quantized macroblock<br>
data from MPEG2 to MPEG4 mode, where MPEG4 encoding is utilized. In this case the<br>
quantization scale in use by the MPEG4 intra block encoding can be kept lower than 5, allowing the<br>
quantization value for each macro block transcoded to MPEG4 to be adjusted to maintain a lossless<br>
transcoding.<br>
[1043] Fig. 8 illustrates a system in accordance with a specific embodiment of the disclosure. FIG. 8<br>
illustrates a system 700 that comprises a closed loop transcoder 710, an open loop transcoder 712, a<br>
control module 714, an input select switch 102, and an output select switch 702.<br>
[1044] In operation, an input stream comprising digital video data is received by the system 100. The<br>
digital video data will generally include frame based video data such as video data specified by<br>
various MPEG specifications, however, it will be appreciated that other proprietary and standard<br>
video data protocols can be received as well.<br>
[1045] The control module 714 monitors information from the input stream to control switches 102 and<br>
702 to control operation of closed loop transcoder 710 and open loop transcoder 712. In addition,<br>
control module 714 controls switch 702 to provide an output stream transcoded relative to the input<br>
stream. Generally, the control module 714 will enable one of the closed loop transcoder 710 and<br>
the open loop transcoder 712 to provide the output data stream. More specifically, the control<br>
module 714 operates to select as the source of the output data, one of the closed loop transcoder 710<br>
or the open loop transcoder 712 and to control the transcoding process. In one embodiment, the<br>
switch function that results in the selection of the output is implemented by controlling an actual<br>
switch, such as switch 702. In an alternate embodiment, the switch function is implemented by<br>
enabling one of the outputs of the closed loop transcoder 710 and the open loop transcoder 712 so<br>
that only one of the transcoders provides the output stream.<br>
[1046] A closed loop transcoder is a transcoder system that following the generation of a transcoded<br>
data frame, the transcoded data frame is decoded to provide the encoder portion of the transcoder a<br>
decoded reference frame based upon the transcoded data frame. In an open loop transcoder, the<br>
transcoded data frame is not decoded to provide a reference frame to the transcoder.<br>
[1047] In one embodiment, the control module 714 selects closed loop transcoder 710 to transcode a<br>
macroblock of frame data when the transcoding of the received macroblock is to result in a scaling<br>
of the data rate (i.e. data reduction) that is close to one (i.e. no data reduction), and any reference<br>
frames, relative to the received frame, have also been encoded in open-loop mode. In one<br>
embodiment, the open loop transcoder is used when lossless transcoding can be used to perform a<br>
lossless transcode of the input data. For example, using one of the lossless techniques of FIGs. 2, 3,<br>
5, 6, or 7 described herein. In other embodiments, lossy techniques, such as the technique of FIG. 4<br>
can be implemented using the system 700.<br>
[1048] FIG. 9 illustrates a method of selecting between the open-loop transcoder 712 and the closed-<br>
loop transcoder 710.<br>
[1049| At step 801, data to be transcoded is received. In one embodiment this received data is<br>
associated with a frame of video data. At step 804, a determination is made whether the data is to<br>
undergo a data reduction scaling of approximately one based upon a precision value of the system.<br>
For example, a system can be preset, in a programmable or fixed manner, to execute step 806 when<br>
it is determined that the data is to be scaled within a specific range, such as 0.8 to 1.2. Otherwise<br>
the flow proceeds to step 810, where the closed loop transcoder 710 is selected.<br>
[1050] It will be appreciated that when the transcoding to be performed includes a data rate scaling that<br>
is not close to one (i.e. a significant change, e.g. reduction, in data rate) that a new quantization will<br>
need to be performed during the encoding operation. This re-quantization step is a lossy operation<br>
that is performed by a lossy transcoder, such as the closed loop transcoder 712. When a lossy<br>
transcode occurs to a reference frame, the loss of information will be propagated to any frames that<br>
will be subsequently predicted using the reference frame. The need to avoid this error propagation<br>
due to lossy transcoding results in the use of the closed loop transcoder.<br>
[1051] At step 806, a determination is made whether the data to be transcoded is dependent on reference<br>
frames themselves were transcoded by a lossy process (i.e. transcoded using the closed loop<br>
transcoder 710). One way of determining if the reference frames are themselves lossy is for the<br>
transcoder 710 and / or 712 to attach a flag to a frame of transcoded data to indicate whether a lossy<br>
or lossless transcode was used, and for the control module 714 to monitor this flag. Generally this<br>
flag will be an internal flag, providing the transcoder "state" (open/close) used at step 806. This<br>
allows the transcoder to know how previously transcoded frames where transcoded. If the<br>
reference frame has been encoded in lossy mode or if the current frame is targeted to be encoded in<br>
a lossy mode, e.g. the scaling is considered important, then the close loop transcoder is selected<br>
(lossy mode) otherwise flow proceeds to step 808 and the open loop transcoder (losseless) is<br>
selected.<br>
[1052] FIG. 10 illustrates a specific implementation of the transcoder of FIG. 8 in greater detail. The<br>
transcoder of FIG. 10 comprises a closed-loop transcoder and a plurality of open-loop transcoders<br>
as represented by a plurality of open-loop transcoder paths. It will be appreciated that specific<br>
embodiments may include one or more of open-loop transcoder paths illustrated in FIG. 10.<br>
Selection among the open-loop transcoders is controlled by elements 901-903, 921, and 931, which<br>
at least partially represent the control module 714 of FIG. 8.<br>
[1053] The closed loop transcoder of FIG. 10 is represented by the elements that form the data path<br>
including control elements 901, 902 and923, decoder 905, decoder reference frames 910, encoder<br>
915, closed-loop decoder 923, and encoder reference frames 908. When a macroblock or frame is<br>
sent to the closed-loop transcoder it is decoded to produce a decoded reference frame which is<br>
stored with the decoder reference frames 910. Typically the data will be decoded in a conventional<br>
manner using an inverse quantization module, an inverse transformation module, and an inverse<br>
motion compensation module. It will be appreciated that additional modules, or different, modules<br>
may be used to generate the decoder reference frames. Once a frame is decoded it can be sent to the<br>
encoder 915, through the decoder reference frames 910 memory, or through an alternate path 902,<br>
for encoding.<br>
[1054] Typically the data will be encoded in a conventional manner using a motion compensation<br>
module, a transformation modules (such as a discrete cosine transformation module), and a<br>
quantization module. It will be appreciated that additional modules, or different, modules may be<br>
used to generate the decoder reference frames. Once a frame is encoded it is provided to the output<br>
stream through control element 903, and to the closed-loop decoder 925 through control element<br>
923. Typically the newly encoded data will be decoded in a conventional manner by closed loop<br>
decoder 925 using an inverse quantization module, an inverse transformation module, and an<br>
inverse motion compensation module. It will be appreciated that additional modules, or different,<br>
modules may be used to generate the decoder reference frames. Once the newly encoded frame is<br>
decoded it is stored in the encoder reference frames memory for use by the encoder 915.<br>
[1055] FIG. 10 represents a plurality of open-loop transcoders. One or more of the open-loop<br>
transcoders can be implemented in accordance with the present disclosure. In one embodiment a<br>
single open-loop transcoder is implement by the data path including control elements 901, 903,<br>
decoder 905, and encoder 915. In this embodiment, a macroblock or frame from the input stream is<br>
transcoded by being provided to the decoder 905 generate a reference frame. Subsequently, the<br>
decoded reference frame is encoded to provide data to the output stream. In one embodiment, the<br>
open-loop transcoder is selected when the data being transcoded is being transcoded in a lossless<br>
manner, thereby reducing the need to decode the data subsequent to encoding, since the original<br>
reference frame being encoded contains substantially the same data.<br>
[1056] Another embodiment of an open-loop transcoder is illustrated by the data path that includes the<br>
control elements 901 and 903, and quantization scalar 290. In one embodiment, quantization scalar<br>
290 is used when a macroblock or frame of the input stream needs quantization scaling for purposes<br>
of protocol conversion, such as discussed with reference to FIG. 7 for scaling input data from<br>
MPEG2 format to MPEG4 format. Once transcoded (e.g. scaled to be compliant with a different<br>
protocol), the data is provided to the output stream. In order to assure that the received data is<br>
available for any subsequent decoding steps, the data can also be provided to the reference frame<br>
decoder portion 905 so that a reference frame can be stored in the decoder reference frames location<br>
910. It will be further appreciated that the scaling function performed by the quantization scalar<br>
290 can also be performed by the first transcoder described. However, the first transcoder is more<br>
complex requiring more processing resources than use of the quantization scalar 290. Therefore,<br>
use of the quantization requires fewer processing resources resulting in a more efficient transcoder<br>
implementation.<br>
[1057] Another open-loop transcoder is represented by the data path that includes the control element<br>
901, the open-loop protocol transcoder 922, and the quantizer scalar 290, and the control element<br>
923. Input stream data sent to the open-loop protocol transcoder 922 can be transcoded<br>
heuristically using the methods described with reference to FIGS. 2-6, and provided to the<br>
quantization scalar as needed. In this manner the amount of processing resources needed to<br>
transcode input data is reduced. The open-loop protocol transcoder is illustrated as being<br>
implemented separate from the decoder 905 and the encoder 915. However, it will be appreciated<br>
that in another embodiment the open-loop protocol transcoder function could be implemented as<br>
part of one or both of the decoder 905 or the encoder 915. For example the macroblocks from the<br>
input stream could be inverse quantized by the decoder 905 and provided to the encoder 915, by<br>
control module 902, before inverse transformation, thereby allowing the data to be heuristically<br>
transformed. A heuristical transformation module, such as open-loop protocol transcoder 922,<br>
within the encoder 915 could be used to transcode the data prior to quantization. Once heuristically<br>
transformed, the data would be quantized, generally by quantization module 916, and provided to<br>
the output stream. In another embodiment, the input data would not need to be inverse quantized,<br>
and instead, the heuristically transformed data would be sent to the quantization module 290<br>
(connection not shown) before being provided to the output stream. A specific embodiment of<br>
operation of the system of FIG. 10 can be further appreciated based on the method of FIGs. 11-13.<br>
[1058] At step 820 of FIG. 11, a determination is made whether a data rate scaling criteria is met. In<br>
one embodiment, when a data rate scale factor substantially close to 1, as predefined by the system<br>
or a user, is to be maintained, the criteria is met and the flow proceeds to step 822. Otherwise, if<br>
significant data rate scaling is to be performed, for example resulting in a loss of data when a lower<br>
data rate needs to be supported, the flow proceeds to step 851, whereby the data being evaluated is<br>
sent to the closed-loop encoder for transcoding so that an encoder reference frame will be generated<br>
by the closed-loop decoder 915.<br>
[1059] At step 822 a determination is made whether the macroblock or frame data being evaluated is<br>
dependent upon a reference frame that was transcoded in a lossy manner. If so, the flow proceeds<br>
to step 851, so that the current data can be transcoded by the closed-loop transcoder using the lossy<br>
reference data. Otherwise, the flow proceeds to step 824.<br>
[1060] At step 824 a determination is made whether the current macroblock was encoded using dual<br>
prime mode as discussed with reference to FIG. 2. If so, the flow proceeds to step 852 where the<br>
macroblock is sent to an open-loop transcoder for transcoding, otherwise the flow proceeds to step<br>
826. It will be appreciated that with respect to the specific system of FIG. 10 that the open-loop<br>
transcoder of step 852 can be the open-loop protocol transcoder for heuristic transcoding, or to the<br>
open loop transcoder that includes the decoder 905 and the encoder 915. Where a heuristic<br>
transformation is performed, the data will typically be sent to the step 853, where the macroblock is<br>
decoded to generate a reference frame for use in the decoding of subsequent reference frames, if<br>
needed.<br>
[1061] At step 826 a determination to identify an associated frame-type of the data being transcoded. If<br>
B-type data is being transcoded, the flow proceeds to FIG. 12; if a P-type data is being transcoded<br>
the flow proceeds to FIG. 13; if an I-type data is being transcoded the flow proceeds to steps 853<br>
and 854.<br>
[1062] At step 853 the I-type frame is sent to an open-loop transcoder for transcoding. In one<br>
embodiment a quantization scalar, such as quantization scalar 290, is the open-loop transcoder used<br>
to transcode the data. It will be appreciated that other open-loop transcoders can also be used. In<br>
addition, I-frame data is sent to a reference frame decoder at step 854, such as decoder 905, to<br>
facilitate the decoding of subsequent frames that reference the current I-frame.<br>
[1063] When B-type data is encountered at step 826, flow proceeds to step 828 of FIG. 12. At step 828<br>
a determination is made whether the B macroblock being evaluated has been skipped. If so, flow<br>
proceeds to step 854, where the skipped macroblock, or an indication of the skipped macroblock is<br>
provided to an open-loop transcoder for transcoding. It will be appreciated that the open-loop<br>
transcoder need not perform any actual data transformation where a transcoding between protocols<br>
is being performed and the syntax for identifying a skipped B macroblock is the same for both<br>
protocols.<br>
[1064] If the B macroblock was not skipped, the flow proceeds to step 830 where a determination is<br>
made whether the B macroblock depends on reference data that itself was received as skipped data.<br>
When the B macroblock does not depend on skipped reference data the flow proceeds to step 855<br>
where the macroblock information is sent to an open-loop transcoder, such as the open-loop<br>
quantizer scalar 290. Otherwise the flow proceeds to step 832.<br>
[1065] At step 832 a determination is made if the skipped reference data upon which the B macroblock<br>
depends is a subsequently displayed reference data, e.g. displayed, relative to the skipped B-frame<br>
being evaluated. Where the transcode being performed is from MPEG2 to MPEG4, this is invalid<br>
in MPEG4. and the skipped reference frame, or an indication of the skipped reference frame, is sent<br>
to the open-loop transcoder for transcoding. In one embodiment, the open-loop protocol transcoder<br>
922 can be used to transcode the skipped B-frame in accordance with the method of FIG. 4 or FIG.<br>
5. In another embodiment, the open-loop transcoder including the decoder 905 and the encoder 915<br>
can be used.<br>
[1066] If the B macroblock is not dependent on subsequently displayed reference data the flow proceeds<br>
to step 855, where an indication of the skipped B macroblock is provided to an open-loop<br>
transcoder, such as open loop transcoder 922 of FIG. 10.<br>
[1067] Note that none of the B-macroblocks are indicated as decoded when the open-loop transcoding is<br>
used. This is because B-frames are not used as reference frames, making their decode unnecessary<br>
to support the decode of subsequent frames.<br>
[1068] FIG. 13 illustrates a flow used when it is determined at step 826 of FIG. 11 that data associated<br>
with a P-frame is being transcoded. At step 838 a determination is made whether the P macroblock<br>
being evaluated has been skipped. If not, flow proceeds to steps 857 and 858. At step 857, an<br>
indication of the skipped macroblock is provided to an open-loop transcoder such as the open-loop<br>
quantizer scalar, for transcoding. It will be appreciated that the open-loop transcoder need not<br>
perform any actual data transformation where a transcoding between protocols is being performed<br>
and the syntax for identifying a skipped P macroblock is the same for both protocols. At step 858,<br>
an indication of the skipped macroblock is provided to a reference decoder, such as decoder 905.<br>
[1069] If the B macroblock was skipped, the flow proceeds to step 840 where a determination is made<br>
whether the P macroblock is a part of a reference frame for a B macrobock. If not, the flow<br>
proceeds to steps 857 and 858. Otherwise, the flow proceeds to step 842 where a determination is<br>
made whether the P data being evaluate is subsequently displayed reference data to reconstruct a B-<br>
frame. If not the flow proceeds to steps 857 and 858 for transcoding.<br>
[1070] If the P macroblock is reference data for a B-frame and subsequently displayed relative to the B-<br>
frame, the flow proceeds to step 859 where the P data is sent to an open-loop transcoder for<br>
transcoding.<br>
[1071] The various functions and components in the present application may be implemented using an<br>
information handling machine such as a data processor, or a plurality of processing devices. Such a<br>
