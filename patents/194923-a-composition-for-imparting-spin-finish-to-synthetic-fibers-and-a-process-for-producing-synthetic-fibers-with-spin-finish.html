The present invention relates to a composition for imparting spin finish to synthetic fibers and a process for producing synthetic fibers with spin finish. More precisely, it relates to a spin finish to be applied to multi-filaments yam of thermoplastic, synthetic fibers in the step of melt-spinning them, and also to multi¬filaments yam as treated with the spin finish.<br>
Description of the Prior Art<br>
It has heretofore been known to apply an aqueous emulsion of a spin finish for synthetic fibers to multi-filaments of thermoplastic, synthetic fibers in the step of melt-spinning them, and the spin finish comprises a mixture composed of a surfactant, a lubricant, etc.<br>
The surfactant may be either ionic or nonionic. Ionic surfactants are used essentially for the purpose of preventing static electrification of synthetic fibers. After having adhered to synthetic fibers, an ionic surfactant often peels off, during the step of forming yams and the step of processing the yams, to give scum in the yam guides, or it often peels off during the step of heat-<br><br>
treating the yarns to also give carbides such as tar, etc. in the yarn guides. For these reasons, the use of ionic surfactants are problematic in that the cycle for cleaning the yam guides shall be shortened. In order to solve this problem, a spin finish comprising a salt of mono-olefinic dicarboxylic acid or a salt of its derivative has been proposed (see Japanese Patent KOKOKU Nos. 25666/1982 and 14469/1982). Using this, the amount of the substance to be peeled from the yams being formed or processed is reduced. On the other hand, various substances are used as the lubricant constituting the spin finish. For example, for use in the step of forming or processing yarns that is accompanied by heat-treatment at high temperatures, such as in producing draw textured yarns (hereinafter referred to as DTY) from partially oriented yarns (hereinafter referred to as POY) of polyester, the spin finish comprises, as the base component, a polyether-type lubricant in order to minimize as much as possible the formation of carbides such as tar, etc. on a hot plate, etc. However, it is impossible to satisfactorily prevent the formation of such carbides when the spin finish is used. Recently, therefore, it has been proposed to add a silicone compound or a fluoride compound to the spin finish for DTY that shall be sxobjected to heat-treatment at high temperature in order to prevent the accumulation of carbides in the devices used<br><br>
(see Japanese Patent KOKOKU No. 21380/1994, etc.).<br>
However, the conventional spin finish that have heretofore been proposed are still unsatisfactory when used in the recent high-speed yarn forming and processing. (For example, in the recent DTY processing, the rate of the yams to be processed is often above 800 or even 1000 m/min.) In high-speed DTY processing with a radiation heater which has been put to practical use in these days, the temperature of the heater is 400'C or higher and the pyrolysate scum firmly adheres to the guides in the heater. For the system of such high-speed DTY processing, even the spin finish containing such a silicone compound or fluoride compound is unsatisfactory.<br>
In addition, an aqueous emulsion of such spin finish is peculiarly problematic in the following point. That is, bacteria, fungi, yeasts, etc. easily propagate in the emulsion. Therefore, the emulsion is rotted by them to give a gel-like substance, which is accumulated in the yam giiides to often form scum. In order to solve this problem, a large amount of an antiseptic has heretofore been added to the emulsion, which, however, causes another problem in that it results in the increase of the cost of the emulsion and worsens the working environment where the emulsion is used.<br><br>
SUMMARY-QE-T-aE-J&amp;NVB^K€N<br>
We, the present inventors, having noted that the carbides such as tar, etc. as well as scum are essentially derived from the antistatic component (for preventing static electrification) to be in the spin finish for synthetic fibers, have assiduously studied and, as a result, have found that if a small amount of a particular compound is added to the spin finish as an antistatic component and when synthetic fibers are treated with the spin finish, it is possible to drastically reduce the formation of carbides such as tar, etc. and also scum, and that the particular compound as added to the spin finish also acts to prevent an aqueous emulsion of the spin finish from being rotted. On the basis of these findings, we have completed the present invention.<br>
The object of the present invention is to reduce the formation of carbides such as tar, etc. as well as scum during high-speed spinning, drawing and processing and also during high-temperature spinning, drawing and processing which is accompanied by heat-treatment at high temperatures, such as DTY processing or the like, thereby prolonging the cycle of cleaning the yarn guides while noticeably reducing the amount of the antiseptic to be added to an aqueous emulsion of a spin finish for synthetic fibers with reducing the  cost for  spinning,   drawing and<br><br>
processing yarns of synthetic fibers and improving the working environment for spinning, drawing and processing them.<br>
The above-mentioned object and other objects of the present invention will be clarified further more in the following description, and these objects are attained by the present invention comprising the constitution mentioned below.<br>
Specifically, the present invention provides a spin finish for synthetic fibers, which comprises a quaternary ammonium salt of an organic carboxylic acid as an antistatic component (for preventing static electrification). The present invention also provides synthetic fibers as treated with the spin finish.<br>
The quaternary ammonium salt of an organic carboxylic acid for use in the present invention may be represented by a general forroula  (1):<br>
R<br>
R, — N — R4     X-	•  • •   ( 1)<br>
Ra<br>
wherein Ri to R4 each represent an alkyl or alkenyl group having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms; and X- represents an<br><br>
anion of an organic carboxylic acid.<br>
The gxiatemary ammonium salt of an organic carboxylic acid may be a reaction product to be obtained through the reaction of a reaction product, which results from the reaction of a tertiary amine and a dialkyl carbonate, and an organic carboxylic acid.<br>
The spin finish of the present invention may contain a polyether-type lubricant.<br>
BESMiSS:) I^SQ^EP^'IQN Of^^^ffi ^SfM^RH) EI&gt;@QDIMEtJTS The spin finish for synthetic fibers of the present invention comprises, as an antistatic component (for preventing static electrification), a quaternary aittnonium salt of an organic carboxylic acid. Where the spin finish is used for forming and processing yarns of synthetic fibers, which is accompanied by heat-treatment of the yams at high temperatures, such as processing of DTY, it is preferable that the quaternary ammonium salt of an organic carboxylic acid to be in the spin finish is a compound of a general formula  (1):<br>
R<br>
R, — N — R«     X-	•••(!)<br><br>
wherein Ri to R4 each represent an alkyl or alkenyl group having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms, preferably an alkyl or alkenyl group having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms; and X-represents an anion of an organic carboxylic acid.<br>
The amount of the quaternary ammonium salt of an organic carboxylic acid to be in the spin finish of the present invention is generally from 0.1 to 5.0 % by weight, preferably from 0.2 to 2.0 % by weight, relative to the total weight of the spin finish. If the salt content is less than 0.1 % by weight, the antistatic capacity of the spin finish tends to lower. If, however, it is more than 5.0 % by weight, the amount of scum or tar to be formed tends to increase or the degree of oil dropping in the step of processing DTY tends to increase.<br>
The organic carboxylic acid that constitutes the quaternary ammonium salt of the acid for use in the present invention includes aliphatic monocarboxylic acids (e.g., formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, caproic acid, caprylic acid, capric acid, undecanoic acid, lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, behenic acid, 2-ethylhexanoic acid, isostearic acid, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, oleic acid, erucic acid, cyclohexane-carboxylic acid, glycolic acid, lactic acid, laurylthiopropionic acid, etc.), aliphatic dicarboxylic<br><br>

Of these, preferred are aliphatic monocarboxylic acids, aliphatic dicarboxylic acids and aromatic dicarboxylic acids. Especially preferred are 2-ethylhexanoic acid, maleic acid and phthalic acid. One or more of the above-mentioned organic carboxylic acids can be used singly or as combined.<br>
The quaternary ammonium residue that constitutes the quaternary ammonium salt of an organic carboxylic acid for use in the present invention as well as the quaternary ammonium cation that constitutes the compound of formula (1) also for use in the present invention is derived from a quaternated derivative of a tertiary amine having alkyl or alkenyl groups with from 1 to 5 carbon atoms. The tertiary amine includes aliphatic amines (e.g., trimethylamine, triethylamine, tri-n-propylamine, tri-n-butylamine, tri-n-octylamine, octyldimethylamine, lauryldimethylamine, stearyldimethylamine, etc.), cind alicyclic amines (e.g., N-methylpyrrolidine, N-ethylpyrrolidine, N-methylpiperidine, N-ethylpiperidine,   N-methylhexamethyleneimine,   N-<br><br>
ethylhexamethyleneimine, N-methyImorpholine, N-butyImorpholine, N,N'-dimethylpiperazine, N,N'-diethylpiperazine, l,5-dia2abicyclo[4,3,0]-5-nonene, 1,8-diazabicyclo[5,4,0]-undecene, etc.). Of these, preferred are aliphatic amines. Especially preferred are trimethylamine,  triethylamine and octyldimethylamine.<br>
Qioatemary ammonium salts of organic carboxylic acids and compounds of formula (1) for use in the present invention can be obtained by reacting a reaction product, which is obtained through the reaction of a tertiary amine with a dialkyl carbonate, with an organic carboxylic acid, for example,  in the manner as mentioned below.<br>
Quaternary ammonium salts of organic carboxylic acids for use in the present invention can be produced, for example, according to the following method. To produce trimethyloctylammonium 2-ethylhexanoate, one mol of octyldimethylainine is fed into an autoclave along with one mol or more of dimethyl carbonate and methanol and these are reacted under pressure of about 5 kg/cm^ at about 120'C to obtain a methanol solution of trimethyloctylammonium methyl carbonate. Next, the methanol solution of trimethyloctylammonium methyl carbonate is gradually added to 2-ethylhexanoic acid at from 80 to 901C , while carbon dioxide being generated and methanol are removed through distillation.    Next, water is added to the reaction systan.<br><br>
which is thus subjected to complete anion-exchange reaction. After having adjusted its concentration, the system gives trimethyloctylammonium 2-ethylhexanoate.<br>
Compounds of formula (1) can be produced, for example, according to the following method. To produce triethylmethylammonium maleate, one mol of triethylamine is fed into an autoclave along with one mol or more of dimethyl carbonate and methanol and these are reacted under pressure of about 5 kg/cm2 at about 120*0 to obtain a methanol solution of triethylmethylammonium methyl carbonate. Next, a methanol solution of maleic acid is gradually added to the methanol solution at from 80 to 90 *C , while carbon dioxide being generated and methanol are removed through distillation. Next, water is added to the reaction system, which is thus subjected to complete anion-exchange reaction. After having adjusted its concentration, the system gives triethylmethylammonium   maleate.<br>

From Tables 4 and 5, it is understood that the spin finish samples of the present invention each comprising a compound of formula (1) have higher antistatic capacity than the conventional spin finish samples and that the former have higher heat resistance than the latter as producing smaller amounts of tar and scum at high temperatures.<br>
Next, a polyester was melt-spun at a winding-up speed of 3400 m/min to produce POY of 115 deniers/36 filaments, while applying to POY an aqueous 10-% emulsion of the spin finish of Example 5 or Comparative Example 5, through a nozzle, the net amount of the spin finish adhered to POY being 0.3 %. The POY sample was then processed into DTY continuously for one month, at a processing speed of 1200 m/min and at a heater temperature of 450'C / using a false twisting machine (HTS-1500 Model, produced by Teijin Machine Co.). The number of fluffs as formed around the thus-processed DTY was measured and the condition of the soiling, if any, of the guides in the heater was checked, according to the methods mentioned below. The results are<br><br>
shown in Table 6 below.<br>
Test Methods: Number of Fluffs:<br>
One month after the start of the processing test, the yarn thus processed were rewinded at a speed of 150 m/min, while measuring the number of the fluffs as formed per 10000m of the yarn using a fluff tester (DT-140 Model, produced by Toray Co.). Degree of Soiling of Guides:<br>
One month after the start of the processing test, the condition of the soiling, if any, of the guides in the heater was observed with the naked eye.<br>
