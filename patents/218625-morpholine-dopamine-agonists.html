These compounds are useful for the treatment and/or prevention of sexual dysfunction, for example female sexual dysfunction (FSD), in particular female sexual arousal disorder (FSAD) and male sexual dysfunction, in particular male erectile dysfunction (MED). Male sexual dysfunction as referred to herein is meant to include ejaculatory disorders such as premature ejaculation, anorgasmia (inability to achieve orgasm) or desire disorders such as hypoactive sexual desire disorder ' (HSDD; lack of interest in sex). These compounds are also useful in treating neuropsychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative disorders.<br>
The present invention provides for compounds of formula (I), (la) and (Ib)<br>

Compounds of general formula I where A is C-X, B is C-Y, R1 is H or (Ci-Cejalkyl, R2 is H and where X, Y and Z are as described herein may be prepared according to reaction scheme 1. <br>
(Figure Remove) <br>
Compounds of formula (III) may be prepared by reacting an aldehyde of formula II with i) a cyanide source or nitromethane followed by ii) reduction with borane, lithium aluminium hydride or hydrogenation. Some compounds of formula II and III are also commercially available.<br><br>
Compounds of formula (IV) may be prepared by reacting compounds of formula<br>
(III)	with iii),  acid chlorides in the presence of a suitable base such as<br>
triethylamine or 4-methylmorpholine. Typical reaction conditions comprise 1.0<br>

The skilled man will appreciate that due to one of X, Y or Z being a hydroxy group, it will be necessary to protect the hydroxy group(s) with a suitable protecting group throughout the transformations of scheme 1, then remove the protecting group. Methods for deprotection of a phenol group depend on the protecting group. For examples of protection/deprotection methodology see<br><br>
"Protective groups in Organic synthesis", TW Greene and PGM Wutz. For example, where the hydroxy is protected as a methyl ether, deprotection conditions comprise refluxing in 48% aqueous HBr for 1-24 hours, or by stirring with borane tribromide in dichloromethane for 1-24 hours. Alternatively where the hydroxy is protected as a benzyl ether, deprotection conditions comprise hydrogenation with a palladium catalyst under a hydrogen atmosphere.<br>
Compounds of general formula (I) where one of A or B is N, R1 is H or (Cr C6)alkyl, R2 is H and X, Y, and Z are as described herein, with the proviso that one of X, Y or Z is NH2, may be prepared according to reaction scheme 2. Scheme is illustrated where B is C-Y and where Y is Nhb; the skilled man will understand that the alternative compounds are equally practicable.<br>

The skilled man will appreciate that due to one of X, Y or Z being a hydroxy group, it will be necessary to protect the hydroxy group(s) with a suitable protecting group throughout the transformations of scheme 3, then remove the protecting group. Methods for deprotection of a phenol group depend on the protecting group. For examples of protection/deprotection methodology see "Protective groups in Organic synthesis", TW Greene and PGM Wutz. For example, where the hydroxy is protected as a methyl ether, deprotection conditions comprise refluxing in 48% aqueous HBr for 1-24 hours, or by stirring with borane tribromide in dichloromethane for 1-24 hours. Alternatively where<br><br>
the hydroxy is protected as a benzyl ether, deprotection conditions comprise hydrogenation with a palladium catalyst under a hydrogen atmosphere.<br>
Compounds of the formula (I) where the stereocentre alpha to the morpholine nitrogen is defined absolutely may be prepared starting from homochiral compounds of the formula (XI), which may be commercially available or obtained through methods readily available to the skilled man in the chemistry literature.

Compounds of formula (XVIII) may be prepared by reacting compounds of formula (XVI) with xv) amino alcohols of formula (XIV) in the presence of a base such as triethylamine or 4-methylmorpholine. Typical conditions comprise 1 equivalent of the aminoalcohol (XIV) with 1-3 equivalents of triethylamine and 1 equivalent of a compound of formula (XVI) using toluene as solvent at room temperature or above. Compounds of formula (XVI) are commercially available.<br>

Suitable organometallic reagents include Grignard (organomagnesium) or organolithium reagents, which may be prepared from the bromide by halogen metal exchange. Typical conditions comprise addition<br>
of isopropylmagensium chloride to the bromide (XVII) in an anhydrous ethereal solvent such as tetrahydrofuran at room temperature (to perform the halogen metal exchange reaction), followed by addition of the morpholinone (XVIII). The bromide (XVII) may be prepared using the process as described in WO9932475.<br>
Morpholinol (IXX) may be reduced to diol (XX) by xvii) reaction with a hydride reducing agent, such as sodium borohydride in an alcohol solvent such as methanol.<br>
Compounds of formula (XXI) may be prepared from the diol (XX) by ix), deprotection. Typical conditions comprise 1.0 equivalents of compound (XX) and 5 equivalents of hydroxylamine hydrochloride in ethanol at reflux.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) may be prepared by xviii) cyclisation of compounds of formula (XXI) by treatment with acid. Typical conditions employ concentrated sulfuric acid and dichloromethane as solvent at room temperature or above.<br>
All of the above reactions and the preparations of novel starting materials using in the preceding methods are conventional and appropriate reagents and reaction conditions for their performance or preparation as well as procedures for isolating the desired products will be well-known to those skilled in the art with reference to literature precedents and the Examples and Preparations hereto.<br>
The compounds of the present invention have utility as selective D3 agonists in the treatment of disease states. There are a number of compounds with activity as both D2 and D3 agonists; however the use of such compounds is associated with a large number of side effects including nausea, emesis, syncope, hypotension and bradycardia, some of which are a cause for serious concern.<br>
It was previously held that the efficacy of the prior art compounds stemmed from their ability to agonise D2; however D2 agonism is implicated as a cause of the side effects detailed above.<br>
The present invention provides a class of selective D3 agonists. Serendipitously, these have been found to be efficacious, whilst reducing the side effects associated with unselective prior art compounds.<br>
Compounds of present invention are useful in treating sexual dysfunction, female sexual dysfunction, including hypoactive sexual desire disorder, sexual arousal disorder, orgasmic disorder and sexual pain disorder; male erectile dysfunction, hypertension, neurodegeneration, psychiatric disorders, depression (e.g. depression in cancer patients, depression in Parkinson's patients, postmyocardial infarction depression, subsyndromal symptomatic depression, depression in infertile women, paediatric depression, major depression, single episode depression, recurrent depression, child abuse induced depression, post partum depression and grumpy old man syndrome), generalized anxiety disorder, phobias (e.g. agoraphobia, social phobia and simple phobias), posttraumatic stress syndrome, avoidant personality disorder, premature ejaculation, eating disorders (e.g. anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa), obesity, chemical dependencies (e.g. addictions to alcohol, cocaine, heroin, phenobarbital, nicotine and benzodiazepines), cluster headache, migraine, pain, Alzheimer's disease, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, memory disorders (e.g. dementia, amnestic disorders, and age-related cognitive decline (ARCD)), Parkinson's diseases (e.g. dementia in Parkinson's disease, neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism and tardive dyskinesias), endocrine disorders (e.g. hyperprolactinaemia), vasospasm (particularly in the cerebral vasculature), cerebellar ataxia, gastrointestinal tract disorders (involving changes in motility and secretion), negative symptoms of schizophrenia, premenstrual syndrome, fibromyalgia syndrome, stress incontinence, Tourette's syndrome, trichotillomania, kleptomania, male impotence, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), chronic paroxysmal<br><br>
hemicrania, headache (associated with vascular disorders), emotional lability, pathological crying, sleeping disorder (cataplexy) and shock.<br>
Compounds of the present invention are particularly suitable for treating female sexual dysfunction, male erectile dysfunction, neurodegeneration, depression and psychiatric disorders.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are useful in male sexual dysfunction, particularly male erectile dysfunction. Male erectile dysfunction (MED), otherwise known as male erectile disorder, is defined as:<br>
"the inability to achieve and/or maintain a penile erection for satisfactory sexual performance" (NIH Consensus Development Panel on Impotence, 7993)*<br>
It has been estimated that the prevalence of erectile dysfunction (ED) of all degrees (minimal, moderate and complete impotence) is 52% in men 40 to 70 years old, with higher rates in those older than 70 (Melman et al 1999, J. Urology, 161, p5-11). The condition has a significant negative impact on the quality of life of the individual and their partner, often resulting in increased anxiety and tension which leads to depression and low self-esteem. Whereas two decades ago, MED was primarily considered to be a psychological disorder (Benet et al 1994 Comp. Ther., 20: 669-673), it is now known that for the majority of individuals there is an underlying organic cause. As a result, much progress has been made in identifying the mechanism of normal penile erection and the pathophysiologies of MED.<br>
Penile erection is a haemodynamic event which is dependent upon the balance of contraction and relaxation of the corpus cavernosal smooth muscle and vasculature of the penis (Lerner et al 1993, J. Urology, 149, 1256-1255). Corpus cavernosal smooth muscle is also referred to herein as corporal smooth muscle or in the plural sense corpus cavernosa. Relaxation of the corpus<br><br>
cavernosal smooth muscle leads to an increased blood flow into the trabecular spaces of the corpus cavernosa, causing them to expand against the surrounding tunica and compress the draining veins. This produces a vast elevation in blood pressure which results in an erection (Naylor, 1998, J. Urology, 81,424-431).<br>
The changes that occur during the erectile process are complex and require a high degree of co-ordinated control involving the peripheral and central nervous systems, and the endocrine system (Naylor, 1998, J. Urology, 81, 424-431). Corporal smooth muscle contraction is modulated by sympathetic noradrenergic innervation via activation of postsynaptic CM adrenoceptors. MED -may be associated with an increase in the endogenous smooth muscle tone of the corpus cavernosum. However, the process of corporal smooth muscle relaxation is mediated partly by non-adrenergic, non-cholinerg"ic (NANC) neurotransmission. There are a number of other NANC neurotransmitters found in the penis, other than NO, such as calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). The main relaxing factor responsible for mediating this relaxation. is nitric oxide (NO), _which is synthesised from L-arginine by nitric oxide synthase (NOS) (Taub et al 1993 Urology, 42, 698-704). It is thought that reducing corporal smooth muscle tone may aid NO to induce relaxation of the corpus cavernosum. During sexual arousal in the male, NO is released from neurones and the endothelium and binds to and activates soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) located in the smooth muscle cells and endouielium, leading to an elevation in intracellular cyclic guanosine 3',5!-monophosphate (cGMP) levels. This rise in cGMP leads to a relaxation of the corpus cavernosum due to a reduction in the intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]j), via unknown mechanisms thought to involve protein kinase G activation (possibly due to activation of Ca2+ pumps and Ca2f-activated K"1" channels).<br>
Multiple potential sites have been identified within the central nervous system for the modulation of sexual behaviour. The key neurotransmitters are thought<br><br>
to be serotonin, norepinephrine, oxytocin, nitric oxide and dopamine. By mimicking the actions of one of these key neurotransmitters sexual function may be adjusted. Dopamine D3 receptors are expressed almost exclusively in the limbic are of the brain, regions involved in the reward, emotional and cognitive processes.<br>
Without being bound by any theory, it appears that "due to its role in the control of locomotor activity, the integrity of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway is also essential for the display of copulatory behaviour. Somehow, more specific to sexual function, it is likely that dopamine can trigger penile erection by acting on oxytocinergic neurons located in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, and perhaps on the pro-erectile sacral parasympathetic nucleus within the spinal cord". It now appears that the significant site is D3 and not as previously thought, D2.<br>
In essence, D3 is an initiator of sexual behaviour.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides for, the use of a compound of formula (I) in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment or prevention of erectile dysfunction.<br>
Patients with mild to moderate MED should benefit from treatment with the compounds according to the present invention, and patients with severe MED may also respond. However, early investigations suggest that the responder rate of patients with mild, moderate and severe MED may be greater with a selective D3 agonist/PDE5 inhibitor combination. Mild, moderate and severe MED will be terms known to the man skilled in the art, but guidance can be found in The Journal of Urology, vol. 151, 54-61 (Jan 1994).<br>
Early investigations suggest the below mentioned MED patient groups should benefit from treatment with a selective D3 agonist and a PDE5S (or other combination set out hereinafter). These patient groups, which are described in<br><br>
more detail in Clinical Andrology vol. 23, no.4, p773-782 and\chapter 3 of the book by I. Eardley and K. Sethia "Erectile Dysfunction-Current Investigation and Management, published by Mosby-Wolfe, are as follows: psychogenic, organic, vascular, ehdocrinologic, neurogenic, arteriogenic, drug-induced sexual dysfunction (lactogenic) and sexual dysfunction related to cavernosal factors, particularly venogenic causes.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides for the use of a compound of formula (I), (la) or (Ib) in the preparation of a medicament in combination with a PDE5 inhibitor for the treatment of erectile dysfunction.<br>
Suitable PDE5 inhibitors are described herein.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are useful in the treatment or prevention of female sexual dysfunction (FSD), particularly FSAD.<br>
In accordance with the invention, FSD can be defined as the difficulty or inability of a woman to find satisfaction in sexual expression. FSD is a collective term for several diverse female sexual disorders (Leiblum, S.R.<br>
(1998)	-  Definition and  classification  of female sexual  disorders.  Int.  J.<br>
Impotence Res., 10, S104-S106; Berman, J.R., Berman, L. &amp; Goldstein, I.<br>
(1999)	- Female sexual dysfunction: Incidence, pathophysiology, evaluations<br>
and treatment options. Urology, 54, 385-391.).  The woman may have lack of<br>
desire, difficulty with arousal or orgasm, pain with intercourse or a combination<br>
of these  problems.     Several  types  of disease,  medications,  injuries  or<br>
psychological problems can cause FSD.    Treatments in development are<br>
targeted to treat specific subtypes of FSD, predominantly desire and arousal<br>
disorders.<br>
The categories of FSD are best defined by contrasting them to the phases of normal female sexual response: desire, arousal and orgasm (Leiblum, S.R. (1998) - Definition and classification of female sexual disorders. Int. J. Impotence Res., 10, S104-S106). Desire or libido is the drive for sexual<br><br>
expression. Its manifestations often include sexual thoughts either when in the company of an interested partner or when exposed to other erotic stimuli. Arousal is the vascular response to sexual stimulation, an important component of which is genital engorgement and includes increased vaginal lubrication, elongation of the vagina and increased genital sensation/sensitivity. Orgasm is the release of sexual tension that has culminated during arousal.<br>
Hence, FSD occurs when a woman has an inadequate or unsatisfactory response in any of these phases, usually desire, arousal or orgasm. FSD categories include hypoactive sexual desire disorder, sexual arousal disorder, orgasmic disorders and sexual pain disorders. Although the compounds of the invention will improve the genital response to sexual stimulation (as in female sexual arousal disorder), in doing so it may also improve the associated pain, distress and discomfort associated with intercourse and so treat other female<br>
*••<br>
sexual disorders.<br>
Hypoactive sexual desire disorder is present if a woman has no or little desire to be sexual, and has no or few sexual thoughts or fantasies. This type of FSD can be caused by low testosterone levels, due either to natural menopause or to surgical menopause. Other causes include illness, medications, fatigue, depression and anxiety.<br>
Female sexual arousal disorder (FSAD) is characterised by inadequate genital response to sexual stimulation. The genitalia do not undergo the engorgement that characterises normal sexual arousal. The vaginal walls are poorly lubricated, so that intercourse is painful. Orgasms may be impeded. Arousal disorder can be caused by reduced oestrogen at menopause or after childbirth and during lactation, as well as by illnesses, with vascular components such as diabetes and atherosclerosis. Other causes result from treatment with diuretics, antihistamines, antidepressants e.g. selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs)orantihypertensive agents.<br><br>
Sexual pain disorders (includes dyspareunia and vaginismus) is characterised by pain resulting from penetration and may be caused by medications which reduce lubrication, endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, inflammatory bowel disease or urinary tract problems.<br>
As previously discussed, D3 is thought to be an initiator of sexual behaviour. The clitoris is considered to be a homologue of the penis (Levin, R.J. (1991), Exp. din. Endocrinol., 98, 61-69); the same mechanism that provides provides an erectile response in the male produces an increase in genital blood flow in the female with an associated effect upon FSD. In addition there are changes in proceptivity and receptivity.<br>
Thus, in accordance with a preferred aspect of the invention, there is provided use of a compound of formula (I), (la) or (Ib) in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment or prophylaxis of female sexual dysfunction, more particularly hypoactive sexual desire disorder, sexual arousal disorder, orgasmic disorder and sexual pain disorder;<br>
Preferably the compounds of formula (I) are useful in the treatment or prophylaxis of sexual arousal disorder, orgasmic disorder, and hypoactive sexual desire disorder, and most preferably in the treatment or prophylaxis of sexual arousal disorder.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the compounds of formula (I), (la) and (Ib) are useful in the treatment of a subject with female sexual arousal disorder and concomitant hypoactive sexual desire disorder.<br>
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) IV of the American Psychiatric Association defines Female Sexual Arousal Disorder (FSAD) as being:<br><br>
... a persistent or recurrent inability to attain or to maintain until completion of the sexual activity adequate lubrication-swelling response of sexual excitement. The disturbance must cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty. ...".<br>
The arousal response consists of vasocongestion in the pelvis, vaginal lubrication and expansion and swelling of the external genitalia. The disturbance causes marked distress and/or interpersonal difficulty.<br>
FSAD is a highly prevalent sexual disorder affecting pre-, peri- and post-menopausal (± hormone replacement therapy (HRT)) women. It is associated with concomitant disorders such as depression, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and urogenital (UG) disorders.<br>
The primary consequences of FSAD are lack of engorgement/swelling, lack of lubrication and lack of pleasurable genital sensation. The secondary consequences of FSAD are reduced sexual desire, pain during intercourse and difficulty in achieving an orgasm.<br>
It has recently been hypothesised that there is a vascular basis for at least a proportion of patients with symptoms of FSAD (Goldstein et a/., Int. J. Impot. Res., 10, S84-S90.1998) with animal data supporting this view (Park et a/., Int. J. Impot. Res., 9, 27-37,1997).<br>
R.J. Levin teaches us that because "... male and female genitalia develop embryologically from the common tissue anlagen, [that] male and female genital structures are argued to be homologues of one another. Thus the clitoris is the penile homologue and the labia homologues of the scrota! sac. ..." (Levin, R.J. (1991), Exp. Clin. EndocrinoL, 98, 61-69).<br>
Drug candidates for treating FSAD, which are under investigation for efficacy, are primarily erectile dysfunction therapies that promote circulation to male genitalia. .<br><br>
The compounds of the present invention are advantageous by providing a means for restoring a normal sexual arousal response - namely increased genital blood flow leading to vaginal, clitoral and labial engorgement. This will result in increased vaginal lubrication via plasma transudation, increased vaginal compliance and increased genital sensitivity. Hence, the present invention provides a means to restore, or potentiate, the normal sexual arousal response.<br>
Thus, in accordance with a preferred aspect of the invention, there is provided use of a compound of formula (I), (la) or (Ib) in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment or prophylaxis of female sexual arousal disorder.<br>
By female genitalia herein we mean: "The genital organs consist of an internal and external group. The internal organs are situated within the pelvis and consist of ovaries, the uterine tubes, uterus and the vagina. The external organs are superficial to the urogenital diaphragm and below the pelvic arch. They comprise the mons pubis, the labia majora and minora pudendi, the clitoris, the vestibule, the bulb of the vestibule, and the greater vestibular glands" (Gray's Anatomy, C.D. Clemente, 13th American Edition).<br>
The compounds of the invention find application in the following sub-populations of patients with FSD: the young, the elderly, pre-menopausal, peri-menopausal, post-menopausal women with or without hormone replacement therapy.<br>
The compounds of the invention find application in patients with FSD arising from:-<br>
i)        Vasculogenic etiologies e.g. cardiovascular or atherosclerotic diseases, hypercholesterolemia,    cigarette    smoking,    diabetes,    hypertension,<br><br>
radiation and perineal trauma, traumatic injury to the iliohypogastric pudendal vascular system.<br>
ii) Neurogenic etiologies such as spinal cord injuries or diseases of the central nervous system including multiple sclerosis, diabetes, Parkinsonism, cerebrovascular accidents, peripheral neuropathies, trauma or radical pelvic surgery.<br>
iii) Hormonal/endocrine etiologies such as dysfunction of the hypothalamic/pituitary/gonadal axis, or dysfunction of the ovaries, dysfunction of the pancreas, surgical or medical castration, androgen deficiency, high circulating levels of prolactin e.g. hyperprolactinemia, natural menopause, premature ovarian failure, hyper and hypothyroidism.<br>
iv) Psychogenic etiologies such as depression, obsessive compulsive<br>
disorder, anxiety disorder* postnatal depression/'Baby Blues", emotional<br>
and relational issues, performance anxiety, marital discord, dysfunctional<br>
attitudes, sexual phobias, religious inhibition or a traumatic past<br>
experiences.	'<br>
v)       Drug-induced sexual dysfunction resulting from therapy with selective<br>
serotonin  reuptake inhibitors (SSRis) and other antidepressant therapies<br>
(tricyclics and major tranquillizers), anti-hypertensive therapies, sympatholytic<br>
drugs, chronic oral contraceptive pill therapy.<br>
The Compounds of the present invention are also useful in the treatment of depression.<br>
Dopamine D3 receptors are expressed almost exclusively in the limbic area of the brain, regions involved in reward, emotional and cognitive processes. Chronic treatment with several classes of antidepressants are known to increase the expression of D3 in the limbic area, and antidepressant effects of desipramine can be blocked by sulpride (D2/D3 antagonist) when injected to nucleus accumbens (area rich in D3) but not caudate-putamen (area rich in dopamine D2 receptors). In addition, antidepressant effects were observed<br><br>
preclinical models of depression and in patients treated with pramipexole, a D3-preferring agonist. The available information suggests that D3 receptors mediate the anti-depressant activity and that selective D3 receptor agonists represent a new class of antidepressant drugs. Since antidepressants are known to be effective in other psychiatric disorders, D3 agonists would have the potential to treat psychiatric diseases.<br>
The present invention provides for the use of a selective D3 agonist in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of depression and psychiatric diseases.<br>
-Preferably said D3 agonist exhibit a functional potency at D3 receptor expressed as an EC50, lower than 1000nM, more preferably lower than 100nM, yet more preferably lower than 50nM, most preferably lower than 10nM.<br>

In a preferred embodiment, the present invention provides for the use of a compound of formula (I), (la) and (Ib) in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of depression or psychiatric disorders.<br>
Suitable depressive conditions and psychiatric disorders are described above.<br>
The compounds of the present invention also have utility in the treatment of neurodegeneration; sources of neurodegeneration include neurotoxin poisoning; vision loss caused by neurodegeneration of the visual pathway, such as by a stroke in the visual, pathway eg in retina, optic nerve and/or occipital lobe; epileptic seizures; and from impairment of glucose and/or oxygen supply to the brain.<br>

In a preferred embodiment, the D3 agonist is a compound of formula (I), (la) or (Ib)<br>
In addition to their role in treating Sexual dysfunction, depression, neurodegeneration and psychiatric disorders, the compounds of the present invention are likely to be efficacious in a number of additional indications.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides for the use of compounds of formula (I), (la) or (Ib) in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of hypertension, premature ejaculation, obesity, cluster headache, migraine, pain, endocrine disorders (e.g. hyperprolactinaemia), vasospasm (particularly in the cerebral vasculature), cerebellar ataxia, gastrointestinal tract disorders (involving changes in motility and secretion), premenstrual syndrome, fibromyalgia syndrome, stress incontinence, trichotillomania and chronic paroxysmal hemicrania, headache (associated with vascular disorders).<br>

(4x assay concentration) using PBS. 25pL of 40\M stock is added to all wells using a Multi-drop, giving a final concentration of 10p,M. Plates are then sealed and incubated at 37°C in a Westbart incubator while cells are harvested.<br>
•	Cells are harvested from flasks, which are between 70% - 80% confluent. It<br>
is essential that all components added to the cells are warmed to 37°C. 5 mL<br>
of CDS is added per T225 flask and incubated at 37°C for 5 minutes before<br>
being neutralised with 5mL PBS. The cells are then centrifuged at 160g<br>
(1000rpm) for 5 minutes.  The resultant supernatant is discarded and cells<br>

RESUSCITATION OF FROZEN AMPOULES<br>
Remove ampoules from liquid nitrogen and allow them to equilibrate for 2 minutes as trapped gas or liquid may cause the ampoule to expand rapidly and explode. They can also be placed at minus 20°C for 2 minutes before thawing.<br>
Thaw ampoules quickly and completely at 37°C in a water bath.<br>
Transfer cell suspension to a 75cm2 flask containing 10ml_ growth media and incubate for 24h at 37°C, 5% CO2. After cell attachment (3-6 hours) media is removed and replaced with fresh media (to remove DMSO), After 24h, if approaching confluency, cells are transferred to a 225cm2 flask. If not, the cells are maintained until they are 70%-80% confluent.<br>
Cell harvesting and splitting<br>
Cells are split on a Friday to provide cells for assays on Monday and Tuesday. Cells required for the remainder of the week are split on a Monday.<br><br>
It is essential not to allow the hD3CHO cells grow beyond 80% confluence, or to create splits &gt;1:20, as this has detrimental effects on their proliferative response and will subsequently effect the cells ability to perform in the assay.<br>
Cells are grown in 225cm2 flasks (Jumbos). Every component added to the cells must be warmed to 37°C before use.<br>
Cell harvest<br>
'Growth media is removed from flasks and cells are washed with warm PBS (Gibco. 14040-091) and removed.<br>
•	5mL of cell dissociation buffer is added to cells and placed in incubator<br>
for approx. 5 minutes.<br>
•	Flasks given a sharp tap to dislodg,^ any remaining cells from the tissue<br>
culture plastic.<br>
•	5mLof PBS is added to the cells and used to wash the base and of the<br>
flask. Cells are centrifuged for 5 minutes at 160g (lOOOrpm) to pellet the<br>
cells.<br>
•	Supernatant is discarded and 5mL of Stimulation Buffer is used to re-<br>
suspend the cells. A trypan blue exclusion assay is carried out to<br>
determine the number of viable cells.<br>
•	Cells are diluted in Stimulation Buffer to yield a concentration of 5 x 105<br>
cells/ml.<br>
•	To passage to cells the centrifugation step is omitted and the cell<br>
suspension is dispensed into new T225 flasks containing 50mL media.<br>
Split ratios<br><br>
hD3CHO are split between 1:5 to 1:10. The culture cannot be continued beyond<br>
passage<br>
30 as cell line characteristics are lost with increased passage.<br>
Crvopreservation of cell lines<br>
It is essential to create a cell bank of your own cells to resuscitate for further use.<br>
•	Cells are harvested as described in the previous section.   Following the<br>
trypan blue exclusion assay, cells are diluted in medium containing 10%<br>
DMSO to achieve 2 to 4x106 cells/ml.	&amp;<br>
•	Cells are divided into 1ml aliquots and immediately frozen down gradually, in<br>
a 'Mr Frosty', (containing fresh IPA) at -80°C prior to being transferred to a<br>
gaseous-phase liquid- nitrogen storage vessel. (Cells may be stored in the<br>
'Mr Frosty' for up to 2 days).<br>
It is advisable to test the cell viability by thawing one ampoule after freezing. Viabilities below 70 % may cause problems on recovery due to low cell numbers and the presence of debris.<br>
DATA ANALYSIS<br>
The data is analysed using ECADA.<br>
% Normalisation (in relation to pramipexole) is generated for all compounds via the following formulae:<br>
% Normalisation = (X-BO)/(Max-BO) x100<br>
where,<br><br>
x = Average net counts for a given concentration of test compound, Bo = Average net counts of minimum control (OnM of Pramipexole) and, Max =Average net counts given of maximum control (100nM Pramipexole)<br>
Curves can be generated by plotting % normalisation (y) versus concentration of agonist in nM (x). Data is fitted using non-linear regression with the slope constrained to 1. From this, an EC50 and %Emax for the test compound are determined.<br>

PROTOCOLS Compound Dilutions<br>
•	Pramipexole is included as a reference standard.   A 10-point, semi-log<br>
curve is generated every 4 plates. Compound responses are normalised<br>
to the minimum (OnM pramipexole) and maximum (1000nM Pramipexole)<br>
responses generated by the cells. AH test compounds may also be tested<br>
via a 10-point (semi-log) curve.<br>
•	Test  compounds   are  dissolved   in   100%  DMSO  to  yield  a   stock<br>
concentration of 10mM, (1000x the final assay concentration required,<br>
e.g. 10mM will give a top concentration of 10000nM).<br>
•	Pramipexole is dissolved in 100% DMSO to give a concentration of<br>
10mM.   Pramipexole is diluted further to 1mM in 100% DMSO via a 10-<br>
fold dilution.<br>
•	Further dilutions and additions are carried out in 0.4%DMSO/PBS using a<br>
suitable Tecan Genesis Protocol which is capable of performing serial<br>
dilutions at a fold of 3.159 (semi-log unit).<br>
TECAN GENESIS DILUTIONS<br>
•	10jal_ of the test compounds are added to column 1 of a microplate.<br>
240pJL irf 0.4% DMSO/PBS is added to this to give a 25-fold dilution<br>
(0.4mM).  20|al_ of the 0.4mM dilution is transferred to wells of column 2<br>
where 180uL of 0.4% DMSO/PBS is added, giving a further 10-fold<br>
dilution to achieve a 4xtop assay concentration (0.04mM).<br>
•	Serial dilutions are performed (3.159-fold) to achieve a semi-log dilution<br>

40uM,   "\2.7\M, 4\W,  1.27nM, 400nM,  130nM, 40nM,  13nM,  4nM, 1.3nM<br>
25|ul_ (in duplicate) of the serial dilutions are transferred to columns 2-11<br>
of the Flashplate (See Appendix).    Since the finals assay volume is<br>
100|j,L, the final assay concentrations will be:<br>
10,OOOuM, 3170nM, 1000nM, 320nM, 100nM, 32nM, 10nM, 3nM, 1nM,<br>
0.3nM<br>
Minimum control (low control): 25^1 of 0.4% DMSO)(PBS (vehicle) is added to the following wells (column 1 wells E-H and column 2 wells A-D). Cells and forskolin are added later.<br>
•	Maximum control (high control): 10mM pramipexole is diluted in PBS via<br>
a 250-fold dilution (10j4.L + 2490jj.L PBS) to generate 40p,M pramipexole.<br>
40^M   pramipexole   is   further   diluted   via   a    10-fold   dilution   in<br>
0.4%DMSO/PBS (100^1- + 990jj,L Vehicle) to generate 4000nM (4x assay<br>
concentration    of   the    standard    pramipexole).    25jxL    of   4000nM<br>
pramipexole is added to the following wells of the Flashplate to yield<br>
1000nM pramipexole final; column 1 wells A-D and column 12 wells E-H.<br>
Cells + forskolin are added later.<br>
Cvclase-activation Flashplate assay. (MEN SMP004B)<br>
•	As described in the Materials section, forskolin is dissolved in distilled<br>
water to achieve a stock concentration of 20mM. This is further diluted to<br>
20jj,M (4x assay concentration) using PBS.   25jj.L is added to all wells<br>
using a Multi-drop, giving a final concentration of 5jj.M.   Plates are then<br>
sealed and incubated at 37°C in a Westbart incubator while cells are<br>
harvested.<br>
•	Cells are harvested from flasks which are between 70% - 80% confluent.<br>
It is essential that all components added to the cells are warmed to<br>
37°C. 5ml_ of CDS is added per 225cm2 flask, and incubated at 37°C for<br>
5 minutes before being neutralised with 5mL PBS. The cells are then<br>
centrifuged at 160g (1000rpm) for 5 minutes. The resultant supernatant<br>
is discarded and cells are re-suspended in Stimulation Buffer (warmed to<br>
37°C), to achieve 1 x 105 cells/ml.    50(j.l of cell suspension is then<br>
dispensed into all wells of the Flashplate.<br>
•	Plates are immediately incubated at 37°C on a shaking incubator for 15<br>
minutes.   The reaction is terminated with 100jnl of Detection Mix in all<br>
wells (100^iL 125I cAMP: 11 ml Detection buffer plate).<br>
•	Plates are re-sealed and incubated in the dark for 3 hours to allow<br>
equilibrium between the anti-cAMP antibody (coating the wells), [125I]-<br>
cAMP tracer and cellular cAMP.<br>
•	Plates are counted on a Packard Topcount NXT using a suitable ECADA<br>
compatible protocol (Protocol 75)<br>
RESUSCITATION OF FROZEN AMPOULES<br>
Remove ampoules from liquid nitrogen and allow them to equilibrate for 2 minutes as trapped gas or liquid may cause the ampoule to expand rapidly and explode. They can also be placed at minus 20°C for 2 minutes before thawing.<br>
Thaw ampoules quickly and completely at 37°C in a water bath.<br>
Transfer cell suspension to a 75cm2 flask containing 10rriL growth media and incubate for 24h at 37°C, 5% CO2. After cell attachment (3-6 hours) media is removed and replaced with fresh media (to remove DMSO). After 24h, if approaching confluency, cells are transferred to a 225cm2 flask. If not, the cells are maintained until they are 60% confluent.<br>
Cell harvesting and splitting<br>
Cells are split on a Friday to provide cells for assays on Monday and Tuesday. Cells required for the remainder of the week are split on a Monday. It is essential not to allow the cells grow beyond 60% confluence as this has detrimental effects on their proliferative response and will subsequently effect the cells ability to perform in the assay.<br>
Cells are grown in 225cm2 flasks (Jumbos). Every component added to the<br>
cells must be warmed to 37°C before use. Cell harvest<br>
Growth media is removed from flasks and cells are washed with warm PBS (Gibco. 14040-091) and removed.<br>
•	5mL of cell dissociation buffer is added to cells and placed in incubator<br>
for approx. 5 minutes.<br>
•	Flasks given a sharp tap to dislodge any remaining cells from the tissue<br>
culture plastic.<br>
•	5ml_of PBS is added to the cells and used to wash the base and of the<br>
flaskr'Cells are centrifuged for 5 minutes at 160g (-1000rpm) to pellet the<br>
cells.<br>
•	Supernatant is discarded and 5ml_ of Stimulation Buffer is used to re-<br>
suspend the cells. A trypan blue exclusion assay is carried out to<br>
i<br>
determine the number of viable cells.<br>
•	Cells are diluted in Stimulation Buffer to yield a concentration of 1 x 105<br>
cells/ml.<br>
•	To passage to cells the centrifugation step is omitted and the cell<br>
suspension is dispensed into new T225 flasks containing 50mL media.<br>
Split ratios<br>
GH4C1/D2 are split between 1:3 to 1:5. Crvopreservation of cell lines<br>
It is essential to create a cell bank of your own cells to resuscitate for further use.<br>
•	Cells are. harvested as described in the previous section.   Following the<br>
trypan blue exclusion assay, cells are diluted in medium containing 10%<br>
DMSO to achieve 2 to 4x106 cells/ml.<br>
•	Cells are divided into 1 ml aliquots and immediately frozen down gradually, in<br>
a 'Mr Frosty', (containing fresh IPA) at -80°C prior to being transferred to a<br>
gaseous-phase liquid- nitrogen storage vessel. (Cells may be stored in the<br>
'Mr Frosty' for up to 2 days).<br>
It js advisable to test the cell viability by thawing one ampoule after freezing. Viabilities below 70 % may cause problems on recovery due to low cell numbers and the presence of debris.<br>
DATA ANALYSIS<br>
The data is analysed using ECADA.<br>
% Normalisation (in relation to pramipexole) is generated for all compounds via the following formulae:<br>
% Normalisation = (X-BO)/(Max-BO) x100<br>
where,<br>
x = Average net counts ror a given concentration of test compound, Bo = Average net counts of minimum control (OnM of Pramipexole) and, Max =Average net counts given of maximum control (100nM Pramipexole)<br>
Curves can be generated by plotting % normalisation (y) versus concentration of agonist in nM (x). Data is fitted using non-linear regression with the slope constrained to 1. From this, an EC50 and %Emax for the test compound are determined.<br>
Column 1: Wells A-D = MAX: High Controls (cells + forskolin + 100nM pramipexole)<br>
Wells E-H = MIN:   Low Controls (cells + forskolin + vehicle)<br>
Column 12:   Wells A-D = MIN:    Low Controls (cells + forskolin + vehicle)<br>
Wells E- H =MAX:    High Controls (cells + forskolin + 100nM pramipexole)<br>
Columns 2-11: 10-point serial dilutions (in duplicate) of test-compounds. Decreasing concentrations from columns 2 to 11 (1000nM to O.OSnM). Pramipexole replaces C1 in first plate.<br>
Using the assay described above, the compounds of the present invention all exhibit a functional potency at D3 receptor expressed as an EC50, lower than 1000nM and a 10 fold selectivity for D3 over D2.<br>
Compound of example 8 has a functional potency at D3 receptor expressed as an EC50, of 7.6nM and 1315.8 fold selectivity for D3 over D2. Selectivity is calculated as the D2 EC50 value divided by the D3 EC50 value. Where the<br>
value of the D2 EC50 was &gt;10000, a figure of 10000 was used in the calculation.<br>

The compounds of the formula (I) can be administered alone but will generally be administered in admixture with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient, diluent or carrier selected with regard to the intended route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides for a composition comprising a compound of formula (I), (la) or (Ib) and a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier.<br>
For example, the compounds of the formula (I), (la) or (Ib) can be administered orally, buccally or sublingually in the form of tablets, capsules, ovules, elixirs, solutions or suspensions, which may contain flavouring or colouring agents, for immediate-, delayed-, modified-, sustained-, pulsed- or controlled-release applications. "<br>
Such tablets may contain excipients such as microcrystalline cellulose, lactose, sodium citrate, calcium carbonate, dibasic calcium phosphate and glycine, disintegrants such as starch (preferably corn, potato or tapioca starch), sodium starch glycollate, croscarmellose sodium and certain complex silicates, and granulation binders such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC), sucrose, gelatin and acacia. Additionally, lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid, glyceryl behenate and talc may be included.<br>
Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in gelatin capsules. Preferred excipients in this regard include lactose, starch, a cellulose, milk sugar or high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. For aqueous suspensions and/or elixirs, the compounds of the formula (I), (la) or<br>
(Ib) may be combined with various sweetening or flavouring agents, colouring matter or dyes, with emulsifying and/or suspending agents and with diluents such as water, ethanol, propylene glycol and glycerin, and combinations thereof.<br>
The compounds of the formula (I), (la) or (Ib) can also be administered parenterally, for example, intravenously, intra-arterially, intraperitoneally, intrathecally, intraventricularly, intraurethrally, intrastemally, intracranially, intramuscularly or subcutaneously, or they may be administered by infusion techniques. For such parenteral administration they are best used in the form of a sterile aqueous solution which may contain other substances, for example, enough salts or glucose to make the solution isotonic with blood. The aqueous solutions should be suitably buffered (preferably to a pH of from 3 to 9), if necessary. The preparation of suitable parenteral formulations^under sterile conditions is readily accomplished by standard pharmaceutical techniques well-known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The compounds of formula (I), (la) or (Ib) can also be administered intranasally or by inhalation, typically in the form of a dry powder (either alone, as a mixture, for example, in a dry blend with lactose, or as a mixed component particle, for example, mixed with phospholipids) from a dry powder inhaler or as an aerosol spray from a pressurised container, pump, spray, atomiser (preferably an atomiser using electro! lydrodynamics to produce a fine mist), or nebuliser, with or without the use of a suitable propellant, such as dichlorofluoromethane.<br>
The pressurised container, pump, spray, atomizer, or nebuliser contains a solution or suspension of the active compound comprising, for example, ethanol (optionally, aqueous ethanol) or a suitable alternative agent for dispersing, solubilising, or extending release of the active, the propellant(s) as solvent and an optional surfactant, such as sorbitan trioleate or an oligolactic acid.<br>
Prior to use in a dry powder or suspension formulation, the drug product is micronised to a size suitable for delivery by inhalation (typically less than 5 microns). This may be achieved by any appropriate comminuting method, such as spiral jet milling, fluid bed jet milling, supercritical fluid processing to form nanoparticles, high pressure homogenisation, or spray drying.<br>
A suitable solution formulation for use in an atomiser using electrohydrodynamics to produce a fine mist may contain from 1ug to 10mg of the compound of the invention per actuation and the actuation volume may vary from 1ul to 100ul. A typical formulation may comprise a compound of formula (I), (la) or (Ib), propylene glycol, sterile water, ethanol and sodium chloride. Alternative solvents which may be used instead of propylene glycol include glycerol and polyethylene glycol.<br>
Capsules, blisters and cartridges (made, for example, from gelatin or HPMC) for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated to contain a powder mix of the compound "of the invention, a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch and a performance modifier such as /-leucine, mannitol, or magnesium stearate.<br>
Formulations for inhaled/intranasal administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release.<br>
Alternatively, the compounds of the formula (I), (la) or (Ib) can be administered in the form of a suppository or pessary, or they may be applied topically in the form of a gel, hydrogel, lotion, solution, cream, ointment or dusting powder. The compounds of the formula (I), (la) or (Ib) may also be dermally or transdermally administered, for example, by the use of a skin patch. They may also be administered by the pulmonary or rectal routes.<br>
They may also be administered by the ocular route. For ophthalmic use, the compounds can be formulated as micronised suspensions in isotonic, pH adjusted, sterile saline, or, preferably, as solutions in isotonic, pH adjusted, sterile saline, optionally in combination with a preservative such as a benzylalkonium chloride. Alternatively, they may be formulated in an ointment such as petrolatum.<br>
For application topically to the skin, the compounds of the formula (I), (la) or (Ib) can be formulated as a suitable ointment containing the active compound suspended or dissolved in, for example, a mixture with one or more of the following: mineral oil, liquid petrolatum, white petrolatum, propylene glycol, polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene compound, emulsifying wax and water. Alternatively, they can be formulated as a suitable lotion or cream, suspended or dissolved in, for example, a mixture of one or more of the following: mineral oil, sorbitan monostearate, a polyethylene glycol, liquid paraffin, polysorbate 60, cetyl esters wax, cetearyl alcohol, 2-octyldodecanol, benzyl alcohol and water.<br>
The compounds of the formula (I), (la) or (Ib) may also be used in combination with a cyclodextrin. Cyclodextrins are known to form inclusion and non-inclusion complexes with drug molecules. Formation of a drug-cyclodextrin complex may modify the solubility, dissolution rate, bioavailability and/or stability property of a drug molecule. Drug-cyclodextrin complexes are generally useful for most dosage forms and administration routes. As an alternative to direct complexation with the drug the cyclodextrin may be used as an auxiliary additive, e.g. as a carrier, diluent or solubiliser. Alpha-, beta- and gamma-cyclodextrins are most commonly used and suitable examples are described in WO-A-91/11172, WO-A-94/02518 and WO-A-98/55148.<br>
