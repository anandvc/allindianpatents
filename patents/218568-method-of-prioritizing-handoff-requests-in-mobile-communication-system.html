				<td>METHOD OF PRIORITIZING HANDOFF REQUESTS<br>
IN MOBILE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method of assigning a channel for<br>
a handoff in a mobile communication system, and more particularly, to a<br>
method of prioritizing handoff requests in a mobile communication system<br>
in order to assign free channels to queued handoff requests based on their<br>
priorities.<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
In a mobile communication system, handoff is the procedure by<br>
which a call is switched to a new communication channel while a user is<br>
talking. Communication channel switching may be implemented within a<br>
particular cell at one base station or between different cells. During an<br>
inter-cell handoff, how to assign the limited number of available channels<br>
in each cell is a very significant consideration. The channels can be<br>
assigned by prioritizing handoff calls. More specifically, when there are<br>
no available channels in a base station associated with a corresponding<br>
cell, mobile handoff requests are prioritized and queued. Then, if there is<br>
a free channel, the free channel is assigned to the handoff call with the<br>
highest priority. A typical channel assignment procedure for handoff in a<br>
mobile communication system is depicted in FIGs. 1 and 2.<br>
FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a base station 100 in a cell, which<br>
receives channel assignment requests from a plurality of mobile stations<br>
105a, 105b, and 105c located within a handoff region.<br>
Each mobile station 105a, 105b, and 105c sends an RF (Radio<br>
Frequency) signal, requesting for a new channel assignment. Included in<br>
the RF signal is data indicative of the power level detected by the mobile<br>
station. Each mobile station 105a, 105b, and 105c samples the<br>
transmitted power level on a periodic basis and sends them to the base<br>
station 100. The base station 100 receives the sampled power level<br>
readings through an antenna 130 and computes the rate of change of<br>
power level for the corresponding mobile station.<br>
A demodulator 135 converts the received RF signal to digital data.<br>
The digital data includes voice and control data. A processor 140<br>
receives the digital data and extracts the power level data from the voice<br>
and control data. The power level data is stored in a memory 145. The<br>
voice data is transmitted to a mobile telephone switching office (MTSO)<br>
150 which determines the destination of the data. The processor 140<br>
retrieves the power level data for a particular mobile station and<br>
determines from it the cutoff time at which the mobile station will leave<br>
the handoff region 120. Cutoff times are used to determine handoff<br>
priorities. For example, mobile stations having smaller cutoff times are<br>
assigned higher priority than mobile stations having larger cutoff times.<br>
Available channels are assigned to handoff requests based on their<br>
priorities within a queue in which the handoff requests are arranged<br>
according to their cutoff times. These assignments are communicated to<br>
the mobile stations using a modulator 170 and an antenna 165.<br>
FIG. 2 is a flowchart depicting a general handoff call process in a<br>
base station upon channel assignment requests from mobile stations.<br>
Referring to FIGs. 1 and 2, the foregoing will be described in more detail.<br>
Upon receipt of a channel assignment request from a mobile station<br>
(step 201), the processor 140 of the base station 100 then determines<br>
whether the call is a new call or a handoff call (step 203). If the call is a<br>
new call, the base station 100 determines whether any of its channels are<br>
free (step 205). If a free channel exists, the mobile station is assigned<br>
the channel (step 209). If no channels are free, the processor 140 rejects<br>
the call (step 207). If a handoff is requested (step 203), the base station<br>
100 again determines whether any of its channels are free (step 211). If<br>
a channel is free, the mobile station is assigned the channel (step 209). If<br>
no channels are available, the handoff request is placed in a queue (step<br>
213). If multiple handoff requests exist (step 215), they are prioritized<br>
(step 217). A determination is made whether any of the mobile stations<br>
requesting a handoff have left the handoff region 20 of FIG. 1 (step 219).<br>
If the mobile station has left the handoff region 120 and has not been<br>
assigned a new channel by the base station 100, the call is aborted (step<br>
221). Once a channel is available (step 223), the channel is assigned to<br>
the queued handoff request having the highest priority (step 225).<br>
However, since the movement of the mobile stations requesting a<br>
handoff cannot be accurately predicted, it is also impossible to exactly<br>
determine which handoff call will be first cut off. Yet the determination<br>
can be made with a relatively high accuracy by estimating the cutoff time<br>
of each call. The power level of the currently serving base station<br>
measured at the mobile station and the rate of change of the power level<br>
is used to make such an estimation. The power level is a significant<br>
factor which determines a cell boundary and defines a handoff region.<br>
From here the term "cutoff time" is used to refer to the estimated cutoff<br>
time.<br>
FIG. 3 is a flowchart depicting a conventional method of prioritizing<br>
handoff requests in step 217 of FIG. 2.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, the minimum cutoff time MINt is set to an initial<br>
value which is typically infinity (step 301). Next, the base station 100<br>
selects one of the queued handoff requests for which the cutoff time will<br>
be determined (step 303). The cutoff time for a particular mobile station<br>
i is determined by<br>
T(i) = (PmiFPi(i))/R (1)<br>
where T(i) is a cutoff time for a mobile station i; Pmin is a cutoff threshold<br>
power, P1(i) is a current power level detected by the mobile station i and<br>
transmitted to a base station, and R is the rate of change of power level<br>
for the mobile station i, given by<br>
dP1(i) / dt (2)<br>
The processor 140 retrieves the cutoff threshold power Pmin, the<br>
current power level P1(i), and the rate of change of power level R for the<br>
selected handoff request from the memory 145 (step 305). Then, the<br>
processor 140 calculates the cutoff time T(i) using Eq.l (step 370). The<br>
processor 140 compares T(i) with MINt (step 309). If T(i) 
set to T(i) (step 311). Otherwise, it is determined whether there are any<br>
other queued handoff requests (step 313). If there are additional queued<br>
handoff requests, steps 303-311 are repeated. If there are no additional<br>
queued handoff requests, the processor 140 sets the handoff call of the<br>
mobile station having the most critical state to the highest priority (step<br>
315). This corresponds to the mobile station i with T(i) = MIN t This<br>
means that the highest priority is given to a handoff call having the<br>
smallest cutoff time among queued handoff requests and when a channel<br>
becomes available, the mobile station is assigned the channel.<br>
The conventional method of prioritizing handoff requests is based<br>
on the assumption that all handoff calls need channels of the same<br>
capacity. Yet the channel capacities may vary in actual situations. For<br>
example, in areas where radio multimedia service is supported, it may be<br>
more appropriate to change the priority of a handoff according to service<br>
type. Therefore, there is a need for a new channel assignment scheme in<br>
which required channel capacity and service type are taken into account.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a method of<br>
prioritizing handoff requests in a mobile communication system supporting<br>
a multimedia service.<br>
According to an embodiment of the present invention, when there<br>
are a plurality of queued handoff requests, the handoff requests are<br>
prioritized based on the channel capacity, service type, and cutoff time of<br>
the call, and the next free channel is assigned to the handoff request with<br>
the highest priority.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described<br>
in detail with reference to the attached drawings. Particular details of<br>
procedures are presented for better understanding of the present<br>
invention. The call process in a base station for channel assignment upon<br>
a mobile channel assignment request is well-known in the art. Therefore,<br>
the structure of the system and reference numerals shown in FIG. 1 and<br>
the call process for channel assignment also apply to the following<br>
description of the present invention.<br>
In the method of prioritizing queued handoff requests according to<br>
the present invention, the channel capacity of a call and service<br>
characteristics, as well as cutoff time, are considered as parameters.<br>
Accordingly, channel assignment is determined by the parameters of<br>
cutoff time, channel capacity, and service type. Here, service type<br>
involves service name and required service quality. In the preferred<br>
embodiment, even if there is a certain handoff call having the smallest<br>
cutoff time, a channel can be first assigned to another handoff call<br>
requiring a larger channel capacity and related with a particular service<br>
type.<br>
The three parameters which determine the handoff request, i.e.,<br>
cutoff time, channel capacity, and service type, will be described with<br>
reference to FIG. 4.<br>
FIG. 4 is a flowchart depicting a method of prioritizing handoff<br>
requests according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The minimum service margin MINu is set to an initial value which is<br>
infinity (step 401). Next, the base station 100 selects one of the queued<br>
handoff requests for which the service margin will first be determined<br>
(step 403).<br>
The processor 140 retrieves Pmin, P1(i), R, C(i), and k(i) for the<br>
selected queued handoff request from the memory 145 (step 405). C(i)<br>
represents the number of required channels for a mobile station i and k(i)<br>
represents a parameter set according to the service type (e.g., voice, data,<br>
video, etc.) supported by the mobile station i.<br>
Then, the processor 140 calculates the cutoff time T(i) using the<br>
values Pmin, P1(i), and R as part of step 407. The cutoff time T(i) for the<br>
mobile station i is calculated by<br><br>
where T(i) is a cutoff time for a mobile station i; Pmin is a cutoff threshold<br>
power, Pi(i) is a current power level detected by the mobile station i and<br>
transmitted to a base station, and R is the rate of change of power level<br>
for the mobile station i, given by<br><br>
According to the present invention, the second part of step 407 is<br>
the computation of the service margin U(i) for a handoff call, which is<br>
computed according to the following formula:<br><br>
where a is a weight coefficient for the cutoff time, ß is a weight<br>
coefficient for the service type, and ? is a weight coefficient for the<br>
channel capacity. Here, a, ß and ? are assumed to be real positive numbers.<br>
These weight coefficients can be adjusted when necessary. Service<br>
priority is inversely proportional to the service margin, that is, the call<br>
with the lowest service margin is the call with the highest priority and is<br>
served the first. Therefore, in Eq.5, the positive sign (+) means that the<br>
priority is inversely proportional to T(i) and k(i), and the negative sign (-)<br>
means that the priority is proportional to C(i). That is, in calculating the<br>
service margin U(i), the priority increases with smaller cutoff time and<br>
lesser service type value, and increases with more required channels.<br>
However, one or more of these polarities may be reversed in order to<br>
meet special service needs. (In particular, C(i) might be applied the<br>
oppositive way - giving higher priority to smaller channel capacity calls.<br>
Polarity of k(i) may be reversed if we change how we define k(i) - low for<br>
critical service or high for critical service. Polarity of T(i) will not change).<br>
More specifically, the weight coefficients a, ß, and ? are determined<br>
prior to prioritizing the handoff requests with use of cutoff time, channel<br>
capacity, and service type, to assign the priorities of the parameters. For<br>
example, the service type value k(i) can be determined according to the<br>
significance of service associated with time limitation, safety, cost<br>
involved in service loss, and service quality. The value of k(i) should be<br>
small for services having more critical requirements in handoff<br>
performance. The value of k(i) is predetermined for a certain service.<br>
The channel capacity C(i) is obtained by determining the number of<br>
required channels for a mobile handoff call.<br>
The following concept is introduced to prioritize the parameters C(i)<br>
and k(i) in the present invention:<br>
(1) a channel is first assigned to a handoff call requiring a larger<br>
channel capacity. This is done to reduce handoff failures resulting from<br>
the situation where the channel assignments for calls requiring smaller<br>
channel capacity prevent channel assignments for calls requiring larger<br>
channel capacity; and<br>
(2) the handoff priority is controlled depending on service type.<br>
Among the parameters of the service margin U(i) in Eq.5, only the<br>
cutoff time T(i) is variable, and the other parameters are fixed during a<br>
call or service session of mobile operation once they have been<br>
determined.<br>
Among the three parameters, namely, channel capacity, service<br>
type, and cutoff time, either channel capacity or service type alone can be<br>
considered as a parameter for determining the handoff call priority. Or<br>
channel capacity and cutoff time or service type and cutoff time in<br>
combination can be a parameter for determining the handoff call priority.<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, all three<br>
parameters are considered in prioritizing handoff requests which are<br>
placed in a queue.<br>
The processor 140 compares U(i) with MINu (step 409). If U(i) 
MINu, MINu is set to U(i) and the corresponding value of i for which U(i) =<br>
MINu is stored (step 411). Otherwise, it is determined whether there are<br>
any other queued handoff requests (step 413). If there are additional<br>
queued handoff requests, steps 403-411 are repeated. If there are no<br>
more queued handoff requests, the processor 140 sets the handoff call of<br>
the mobile station having the most critical state to the highest priority<br>
(step 415). This means that the highest priority is given to a handoff call<br>
having the smallest service margin U(i) among the queued handoff<br>
requests. This corresponds to the handoff request of the mobile station<br>
with U(i) = MIN u .When a channel becomes available, the mobile station<br>
having the call with the lowest U(i) is assigned the channel.<br>
To summarize the handoff call process in the present invention, if a<br>
handoff request occurs as a mobile station enters a new cell from an old<br>
adjacent cell, it is determined whether there are any free channels. If a<br>
free channel exists, the mobile station is assigned the free channel. If<br>
there are no free channels, the handoff request is queued. When a<br>
channel becomes available, the channel will be assigned to a queued<br>
handoff request. The queued handoff requests are prioritized according<br>
to the following procedure in the present invention.<br>
Weight coefficients are preset for the parameters T(i), C(i), and k(i).<br>
In the case where C(i) is considered to be the primary factor, when a<br>
channel becomes available, the handoff call requiring the greatest channel<br>
capacity is assigned the channel. If there are handoff calls having the<br>
same required channel capacity, U(i) is calculated for each handoff call by<br>
[a.T(i) + ß.k(i)]. Then, the channel is assigned to the handoff call<br>
having the higher priority, that is, the smaller U(i) of the two.<br>
In the case where the three parameters are considered. Then, U(i)<br>
is calculated by Eq. 5 using preset values of a , ß , and ? and determined<br>
values of T(i), k(i), and C(i) for each queued handoff request and the next<br>
free channel is assigned to the handoff request having the smallest U(i).<br>
in the case where k(l) is excluded from a handoff request prioritizing process,<br>
the weight coefficient ß is set to 0 in Eq.5.<br>
Weight coefficients can be given to T(l) and C(l) in determining a priority for<br>
each handoff request. The three priority coefficients and the value of k(l)<br>
according to service types may be varied when necessary.<br>
As described above, the present invention is advantageous because channel<br>
assignment Is Implemented In consideration of complex situations, such as when<br>
multimedia services require various channel capacities. Therefore, handoff<br>
efficiency is maximized, because the three parameters of cutoff time, channel<br>
capacity, and service type are considered in prioritizing handoff requests. As a<br>
result, blocking of a high capacity service call by a low capacity service call is<br>
prevented, and handoff failure is reduced.<br>
While the present invention has been described in detail with reference to the<br>
specific embodiment, it is a mere exemplary application. Thus, it is to be clearly<br>
understood that many variations can be made by anyone skilled in the art within<br>
the scope and spirit of the present invention.<br>
According to an embodiment of the present invention, when<br>
there are a plurality of queued handoff requests, the handoff<br>
requests are prioritized based on the channel capacity, service<br>
type, and cutoff time of the call, and a free channel is assigned<br>
to the handoff request with the highest priority.</td>
