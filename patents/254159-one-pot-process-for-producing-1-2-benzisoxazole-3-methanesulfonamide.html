PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY INVENTION<br>
[0004]<br>
The present inventors have intensively studied an industrially efficient process for producing l,2-benzisoxazole-3-methanesulfonamide, which is economically excellent and is capable of efficient operations, and have found that when 1,2-dichloroethane is used as a solvent, 1,2-benzisoxazole-3-methanesulfonamide can be produced in one-pot system from l,2-benzisoxazole-3-acetic acid as a starting compound without isolating intermediates (e.g., sodium l,2-benzisoxazole-3-methanesulfonate, etc.) in solid form in each step, and when water and 1,2-dichloroethane are used as solvents, l,2-benzisoxazole-3-methane-sulfonamide can be produced from 4-hydroxycoumarin as a starting compound without isolating intermediates in solid form in each step, and they have accomplished the present invention.    Moreover, the present inventors also have intensively studied a process for producing l,2-benzisoxazole-3-acetic acid, which is a first step of the present process, and have found a process wherein the desired 1,2-benz-isoxazole-3-acetic acid can be obtained in high yield by reacting 4-hydroxycoumarin and hydroxylamine using only water as a solvent, and further have found that a rapid decomposition of hydroxylamine, which may unexpectedly occur otherwise, can be suppressed when this reaction is carried out in the presence of a chelating agent, by which the reaction temperature can be easily controlled so that the present process can be made even more desirable. [0005]<br>
The present invention provides a process for producing 1,2-benz-isoxazole-3-methanesulfonamide, which comprises:<br>
(a)	reacting 4-hydroxycoumarin, hydroxylamine or an acid<br>
addition salt thereof, and a base in water to give a first mixture;<br>
(b)	acidifying the first mixture with an acid, adding 1,2-<br>
dichloroethane thereto to give a second mixture, and removing an<br><br>
aqueous layer from the second mixture to give a third mixture containing l,2-benzisoxazole-3-acetic acid and 1,2-dichloroethane;<br>
(c)	removing water from the third mixture by distillation to<br>
give a fourth mixture, adding chlorosulfonic acid to the fourth mixture<br>
and reacting the mixture to give a fifth mixture, and adding a base to<br>
the fifth mixture to give a sixth mixture containing an alkali metal salt<br>
of l,2-benzisoxazole-3-rnethanesulfonic acid;<br>
(d)	adding phosphoryl chloride (also known as phosphorous<br>
oxychloride) to the sixth mixture, and reacting the mixture to give a<br>
seventh mixture containing l,2-benzisoxazole-3-methanesulfonyl<br>
chloride;<br>
(e)	adding ammonia to the seventh mixture and reacting the<br>
mixture to give an eighth mixture containing l,2-benzisoxazole-3-<br>
rnethanesulfonamide; and<br>
(f)	isolating l,2-benzisoxazole-3-methanesulfonamide.<br>
The reaction in (a) is preferably conducted in the presence of a<br>
cheiating agent to give the first mixture.<br>
Preferably the first mixture is washed with 1,2-dichloroethane before acidifying the first mixture in (b). [0006]<br>
The present invention also provides a one-pot process for producing l,2-benzisoxazole-3-methanesulfonamide, which comprises:<br>
(i)         reacting l,2-benzisoxazole-3-acetic acid and chlorosulfonic acid in 1,2-dichloroethane to give a first mixture, and adding a base thereto to give a second mixture containing an alkali metal salt of 1,2-benzisoxazole-3-methanesulfonic acid;<br>
(ii)        adding phosphoryl chloride to the second mixture, and reacting the mixture to give a third mixture containing 1,2-benz-isoxazole-3-methanesulfonyl chloride;<br>
(iii)       adding ammonia to the third mixture and reacting the mixture to give a fourth mixture containing l,2-benzisoxazole-3-methanesulfonamide; and<br><br>
(iv)        isolating l,2-benzisoxazole-3-methanesulfonarnide, wherein all of (i) to (iii) are conducted in a single reactor without isolating intermediates in solid form.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention provides a process for producing l,2-benzisoxazole-3-acetic acid, which comprises reacting 4-hydfoxycoumarin, hydroxylamine or an acid addition salt thereof, and a base in water, and acidifying the resulting reaction mixture with an acid. [000"7]    .<br>
In the above process for producing l,2-benzisoxazole-3-acetic acid, the reaction of 4-hydroxycoumarin, hydroxylamine or an acid addition salt thereof, and a base is preferably conducted in the presence of a chelating agent. [0008]<br>
In the preferred embodiment, the above process for producing l,2-benzisoxazole-3-acetic acid further comprises washing the reaction mixture of 4-hydroxycoumarin, hydroxylamine or an acid addition salt thereof, and a base with 1,2-dichloroethane before acidifying thereof with an acid. [0009]<br>
In further preferred embodiment, the above process for producing l,2-benzisoxazole-3-acetic acid comprises reacting 4-hydroxycoumarin, hydroxylamine or an acid addition salt thereof, and a base in water in the presence of a chelating agent and washing the resulting reaction mixture with 1,2-dichloroethane before acidifying thereof with an acid.<br>
MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS [0010]<br>
The process for producing l,2-benzisoxazole-3-methane-sulfonamide of the present invention is a process for producing 1,2-benzisoxazole-3-methanesulfonamide without isolating intermediates in solid form, more particularly, a process for producing 1,2-benz-<br><br>
isoxazole-3-methanesulfonamide, which comprises using 4-hydroxy-couniarin as a starting compound, and water and 1,2-dichloroethane as solvents, without isolating intermediates in solid form.   Additionally, the process of the present invention may be carried out in a single reactor (one-pot).    However, in the above (b), an aqueous layer is removed from the second mixture consisting of two layers, i.e. the aqrjeous layer and a 1,2-dichloroethane layer.    In such liquid-liquid extraction by batch method, a lower layer is usually transferred to another vessel.   Therefore, a process for producing 1,2-benzisoxazole-3-methanesulfonamide using multiple vessels, preferably two vessels, is also within the scope of the invention. (0011]<br>
The "4-hydroxycoumarin" is commercially available or may be prepared by a conventional method or a modified method thereof.<br>
The 'hydroxylamine' may be a commercially available aqueous hydroxylamine solution, but more preferably is prepared by reacting an acid addition salt of hydroxylamine with a base in a reactor.<br>
The "base" includes, for example, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, etc.     Among them, sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide are preferable, and sodium hydroxide is more preferable.    Usually, these bases are used in the form of an aqueous solution.<br>
Examples of the "acid addition salt of hydroxylamine" are hydroxylamine hydrochloride, hydroxylamine sulfate, hydroxylamine nitrate, hydroxylamine phosphate, etc., and among them, hydroxylamine sulfate is preferable.<br>
The "chelating agent" includes, for example, ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid, an alkali metal salt of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, an ammonium salt of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, an alkali metal salt of hydroxyethylethylenediaminetriacetic acid, an alkali metal salt of dihydroxyethylethylenediaminediacetic acid, 1,3-propanediaminetetra-acetic acid, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, an alkali metal salt of<br><br>
diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, an alkali metal salt of triethylene-tetram'inehexaacetic acid, an alkali metal salt of hydroxyethylimino-diacetic acid, and hydrates thereof.    Preferable chelating agents are ethylenediarninetetraacetic acid, a sodium salt of ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid, a potassium salt of ethylenediarninetetraacetic acid, an ammonium salt of ethylenediarninetetraacetic acid, and hydrates thereof.   Among them, a sodium salt of ethylenediarninetetraacetic acid and hydrates thereof are more preferable. [0012]<br>
In case that the reaction mixture contains plenty of metal ions (e.g. iron ions), and there is a possibility of a rapid decomposition of hydroxylamine, the reaction temperature can be easily controlled by addition of a chelating agent thereto.   The reaction temperature of the present process is usually in the range of 60°C to 100°C, preferably in the'range-of 80°C to 90°C, more preferably in the range of 84°C to 86°C. [0013]<br>
Examples of the "acid" are hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, acetic acid, etc:, and among them, hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid is preferable, and sulfuric acid is more preferable.<br>
Since water is contained in the third mixture of 1,2-benz-isoxazole-3-acetic acid and 1,2-dichloroethane in (b), the water is removed*by distillation from this mixture prior to the reaction with chlorosulfonic acid.<br>
The reaction of l,2-benzisoxazole-3-acetic acid with chlorosulfonic acid may proceed in the presence or absence of dioxarie.   The reaction temperature thereof is usually in the range of 60°C to 8.0°C. [0014]<br>
The "alkali metal salt of l,2-benzisoxazole-3-methanesulfonic acid" is preferably l,2-benzisoxazole-3-methanesulfonic acid sodium salt.<br>
In the preparation of an alkali metal salt of l,2-benzisoxazole-3-methanesulfonic acid, an aqueous solution of a base is usually used<br><br>
therein, and hence, water is removed by distillation from a mixture containing.an alkali metal salt of l,2-benzisoxazole-3-methanesulfonic acid prior to the subsequent reaction with phosphoryl chloride.<br>
In the reaction of an alkali metal salt of l,2-benzisoxazole-3-methanesulfonic acid with phosphoryl chloride, it is preferable to add a tertiary amine such as triethylamine into the reaction mixture.   The reaction temperature is usually in the range of 75°C to 85°C.<br>
The "ammonia" is preferably ammonia g&amp;s, and the reaction temperature is preferably in the range of 30°C to 60°C. [0015]<br>
The isolation step of l,2-benzisoxazole-3-methanesulfonamide in (f) is carried out by concentrating the reaction mixture, adding water thereto, stirring the mixture, followed by collecting the crystals by filtration.    The crystals of l,2-benzisoxazole-3-methanesulfonamide isolated from the mixe<i solvent of water and are high purity.></i>
The isolated l,2-benzisoxazole-3-methanesulfonamide in (f) is further purified by recrystallization to increase the purity thereof.   The solvent for recrystallization includes, for example, aqueous ethanol, aqueous isopropanol etc., and among them, aqueous isopropanol is preferable, and isopropanol containing water in an amount of 45 to 55 % by volume is more preferable.   By further carrying out azeotropic distillation of 1,2-dichloroethane in the recrystallization step, there are obtained crystals of l,2-benzisoxazole-3-methanesulfonamide containing residual 1,2-dichloroethane of not more than 5 ppm.<br>
EFFECTS OF INVENTION [0016]<br>
According to the present process, the desired 1,2-benzisoxazole-3-methanesulfonamide can be produced in a one-pot system without isolating intermediates in solid form, and further, the concentration of the residual solvent 1,2-dichloroethane remained therein can be<br><br>
suppressed to 5 ppni or below, and hence, l,2-benzisoxazole-3-<br>
T»<br>
methanesulfonamide, which is useful as a medicament, can be efficiently, produced in a. quite high purity.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION [0017]<br>
The present: invention is illustrated in more detail by the following Examples, but the present invention should not be construed to be limited thereto.   The purity of the products was measured by high performance liquid chrornatography. Example 1 [0018]<br>
1)	A mixture of hydroxylamine sulfate (43 g), water (113 ml)<br>
and a 25 % aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (57 ml) is stirred, and<br>
thereto are added 4-hydroxycoumarin (21 g) and ethylenediarnine-<br>
tetraacetic acid disodium salt dihydrate (0.4 g), and the mixture is<br>
stirred with heating at 84°C to 86°C for 4 hours.    The reaction mixture<br>
is cooled, and thereto are added 1,2-dichloroethane (30 ml) and water<br>
(43 ml), and the mixture is stirred.   The 1,2-dichloroethane layer is<br>
removed, and the pH value of the aqueous layer is adjusted to pH 1-2<br>
with a 62.5 % sulfuric acid.   The mixture is extracted twice with 1,2-<br>
dichloroethane (120 nil and 10 ml) to give a mixture of 1,2-benz-<br>
isoxazole-3-acetic acid and 1,2-dichloroethane.   The purity of 1,2-<br>
benzisoxazole-3-acetic acid in this mixture is 98 %.<br>
2)	Water is removed by distillation from the above mixture<br>
of l,2-benzisoxazole-3-acetic acid and 1,2-dichloroethane, and thereto<br>
is added dropwise chlorosulfonic acid (15.5 g) while the internal<br>
temperature is kept at 63°C-79°C.   After the addition, the mixture is<br>
stirred for 90 minutes while the reaction temperature is kept at 63°C-<br>
79°C.    After cooling, a 25 % aqueous sodium hydroxide solution is<br>
added to the reaction mixture so as to adjust the pH value thereof to pH<br>
11 or above.    Water is removed by distillation from the reaction mixture<br><br>
to give a mixture of sodium l,2-benzisoxazole-3-methanesulfonate and<br>
T»<br>
1,2-dichloroethane.    Triethylamine (2.4 g) and phosphoryl chloride (17.5 g) are added to this mixture, and the mixture is stirred at a temperature of 77°C~83°C for 6 hours.    After cooling, to the reaction mixture is added 1,2-dichloroethane (80 ml), and ammonia gas is blown into the .mixture until saturated while the reaction temperature is kept at 30°C-60°C.   The reaction mixture is concentrated, and water is added thereto.   The mixture is stirred, and the precipitated crystals are collected by filtration, and washed with water to give crude crystals of 1,2-benzisoxazole-3-methanesulfonamide.    The purity of the crude crystals is 96 %.<br>
3)         The above crude crystals are recrystallized from a 50 % aqueous isopropanol, and dried at 80°C for 16 hours to give crystals of l,2-benzisoxazole-3-methanesulfonamide having a purity of 99 %. Example 2 [0019]<br>
A mixture of hydroxylamine sulfate (344.0 g), water (904 ml) and a 25 % aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (456 ml) is stirred, and thereto are added 4-hydroxycoumarin (168.0 g) and ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid disodium salt dihydrate (3.2 g), and the mixture is stirred with heating at 84°C-86°C for 4 hours.    The reaction mixture is cooled, and thereto is added 1,2-dichloroethane (240 ml).   The mixture is stirred, and the aqueous layer is collected.    The pH value of the aqueous layer is adjusted to pH 1-2 with a 25 % sulfuric acid, and the precipitated crystals are collected by filtration, washed with water, and dried with air at 60°C for 15 hours to give l,2-benzisoxazole-3-acetic acid (170.4 g).<br>
