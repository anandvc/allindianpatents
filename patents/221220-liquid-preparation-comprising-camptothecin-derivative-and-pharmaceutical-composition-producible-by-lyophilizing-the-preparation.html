DESCRIPTION<br>
LIQUID PREPARATION COMPRISING CAMPTOTHECIN DERIVATIVE AND PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION PRODUCIBLE BY LYOPHILIZING THE PREPARATION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a liquid preparation comprising a camptothecin derivative or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, which shows excellent antitumor activities, a pharmaceutical composition that is producible by lyophilizing said liquid preparation, and a process for preparing said pharmaceutical composition.<br>
More particularly, the present invention relates to a liquid preparation for injection comprising a camptothecin derivative which is prepared by binding a compound of the formula [I] :<br><br>
wherein R1 is a substituted or unsubstituted lower alkyl group, X1 is a group of the formula: -NHR2 (R2 is a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl group) or a hydroxy group and Alk is a straight or branched chain alkylene group<br><br>
optionally interrupted by an oxygen atom, and a polysaccharide having carboxyl  groups via an amino acid or  a peptide,   or a pharmaceutically acceptable  salt thereof,   which  is  adjusted to pH  5-8,   or  a pharmaceutical composition produced by lyophilizing  said liquid preparation,   or  a process  for preparing  the  same.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
The  camptothecin derivatives  of  the present invention and pharmaceutically  acceptable  salts  thereof  are medicinal substances  that  show excellent  antitumor  activities  against various  tumors,   especially they show excellent therapeutic effects  on solid tumors such as pulmonary cancer,   uterine cancer,   ovarian cancer,   breast  cancer,   or gastrointestinal cancer   (large bowel  cancer,   gastric cancer,   etc.).     It has been known that  said compounds  can be  administered parenterally   (e.g.   intravascular  injection)   generally in the  form of  a  liquid preparation   (e.g.   solution,   suspension, emulsion,   etc.)    (JP-10-72467A,   EP-0757049A) .<br>
DISCLOSURE  OF   INVENTION<br>
The  camptothecin derivative  above has the  structure wherein  a  camptothecin compound   (active  substance)   of  the formula   [I]   is bound to a polysaccharide   (carboxymethylated dextran  or pulluian)   through a  spacer   (an amino acid or  a<br><br>
peptide) .  Said camptothecin derivatives, when formulated into a liquid preparation, often undergo hydrolysis at the site of spacer or polysaccharide moiety during the preparation process or storage.  Hydrolysis of the polysaccharide moiety results in the reduction of the mean molecular weight of said camptothecin derivatives and the increase of the molecular weight distribution, which variation of molecular weight is apt to affect adversely to the pharmacokinetics of said medicinal substance.  Further, hydrolysis of the spacer would result in the release of a considerable amount of an active substance (camptothecin compound [I]) at the time of preparation, which is unfavorable in terms of therapeutic effects or side effects. Accordingly/ it was desired to find a liquid preparation that is excellent as to drug stability during the preparation process and storage.<br>
The present inventors have intensively studied to solve the problems above, and have found that a liquid preparation with excellent stability can be obtained by adjusting the pH of a liquid preparation comprising a camptothecin derivative of the present invention between 5 and 8 during the preparation process thereof, and have accomplished the present invention.<br>
That is, the present invention provides a liquid preparation for injection comprising a camptothecin<br><br>
derivative wherein  a  camptothecin compound of  the  formula [I]   above  is  bound to  a polysaccharide having carboxyl groups via  an  amino  acid or  a peptide,   or  a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable  salt  thereof,   which preparation is  adjusted  to  pH  5-8.<br>
Further,   the present inventors have  found that a pharmaceutical   composition prepared by lyophilizing the liquid preparation above  also shows  excellent drug stability during the preparation process   and storage. Accordingly,   the present  invention also provides  such  a pharmaceutical   composition.<br>

Example 1<br>
Preparation   for   liquid  preparations<br><br>
Based on ingredients of Table 1 below, an aqueous drug solution was prepared and filtered through a membrane<br>
filter (type: GS, pore diameter: 0.22pm prepared by Millipore Ltd.).  The filtrate (lmL) was filled into a grass 3mL-ampoule.  Each ampoule was sterilized in vapor at<br>
100°C for 15 min to obtain a liquid preparation.<br>
Drug: Camptothecin derivative described in Example 84 of<br>
Jp-10-72467A as represented by the following formula:<br><br><br>
The preparation prepared above was preserved under each preservation condition (at 60°C for 20 days, 50°C for 30 days or 40°C for 120 days), and the stability of the drug was tested (Mean molecular weight and molecular weight distribution, and amount of free active camptothecin) .  The result was shown in the following Table 2.  The mean molecular weight of the drug was calculated by GPC multi angles Laser scattering method (MALLS method) and the mean molecular weight distribution was calculated by the following formula:<br>
Mean molecular weight distribution = weight of mean molecular weight (MW)/number of mean molecular weight (MN)<br><br><br><br><br>
* : Active camptothecin compound means a compound of the following formula and the amount was quantitatively analyzed by the following conditions (the same hereinafter).<br>
Quantitative analysis : A sample solution was diluted with 0.2M formic acid-ammonium formate buffer in 200 times and then, the diluted solution (0.4mL) and an internal standard solution (O.lmL) were mixed and the mixture was<br>
filtered through a membrane filter (pore diameter; 0.45μm) to prepare a test sample for quantitative analysis.  The sample was quantitatively analyzed by subjecting to HPLC under the following conditions.<br>
The amount (%) of free active camptothecin in each sample was calculated as 100% of the amount of free active camptothecin compound produced by adding 10 times amount of<br><br>
6N hydrochloric acid to the sample solution preserved in a refrigerator and then heating at 100°C for 4 hours. HPLC conditions : •Column: Inertsil ODS (prepared by GL Science Inc.)<br>
•	Mobile phase : 35mii formic acid-ammonium formate<br>
buffer (pH3)/acetonitrile=80/20 (flow : l.OmL/min.)<br>
. Column temperature: 40°C<br>
•	Detection : Fluorophotometer (Ex=360, Em=420nm)<br>
•Active camptothecin compound:<br><br>
wherein Ra is hydrogen atom, Gly-, Gly-Gly- or Gly-Gly-Gly-.<br>
From the result above, in the liquid preparations of the present inve~t;on (pH 5-8), decrease of the mean molecular weight c! the drug is less in comparison with a liquid preparation of the comparative example and therefore, increase of the molecular weight distribution of the drug was recognized beilyg protected.  This reveals that in the liquid preparation of the present invention degradation of the drug(namely cleavage of chain of dextran molecule) can be prevented and uidesired formation of free active camptothecin compound due to degradation of spacer portion can be also prevented.<br>
