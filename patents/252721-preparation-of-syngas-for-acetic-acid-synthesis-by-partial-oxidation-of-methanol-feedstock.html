BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION	<br>
[0001] This invention generally relates to a method for the process for making<br>
hydrogen and carbon monoxide by partial oxidation reforming of a lower alcohol,<br>
e.g., methanol, and more particularly to a process for making acetic acid from  a<br>
methanol feedstock and carbon monoxide obtained by partial oxidation of methanol.<br>
[0002] In recent years, methanol production has increased in countries with<br>
high gas production due the development of high capacity plants utilizing high yield<br><br>
processes, for example, the Mega-methanol technology.  Market conditions sin<br><br>
different locations can often result in relatively low methanol ;prices (in the case of an<br>
oversupply) and relatively high natural gas prices (in the case of a shortage), due<br>
generally to excessive usage in the heating of  buildings and homes, and as well as<br>
high usage in power plants.    For example, in chemical plants where syngas is<br>
produced for the purpose of extracting CO for the synthesis of acetic acid, high costs<br>
can make natural gas cost prohibitive as a feedstock.	<br>
[0003] The primary raw materials in  acetic acid manufacture are carbon<br>
monoxide (CO) and methanol.   By retrofitting existing methanol plants to include<br><br>
acetic acid synthesis units, it is possible to eliminate the step of importing methanol<br>
for the synthesis of acetic acid, instead producing methanol in situ for the acetic acid<br>
synthesis. The retrofit of existing methanol plants for the manufacture of acetic acid<br><br>
is known in the art. Representative references disclosing this and similar processes<br>
include US Pat. Nos. 6,232,352 to Vidalin, 6,274,096 to Thiebaut et al, and 6,353,133<br><br>
to Thiebaut et al, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference.	<br><br>
[0004] In US Pat. No. 3,920,717, Marion discloses a continuous process for<br><br>
the production of methanol from solid and/or liquid hydrocarbon material in a catalyst<br>
free reaction zone using a partial oxidation reactor. In US Pat. No. 4,006,099, Marion<br>
et al. disclose improved combustion efficiency in the non-catalytic partial oxidation of<br>
liquid hydrocarbonaceous materials in a doublefannulus-type burner. In US Pat. Nos.<br><br>
4,081,253 and 4,110,359, Marion discloses a method for producing synthesis gas,<br><br>
substantially comprising H2 and CO and having a mole ratio (H2/CO) of about 0.5 to<br>
1.9 by partial oxidation of a hydrocarbonaceous fuel with substantially pure oxygen.<br>
[0005] The use of partial oxidation reactors for the reforming of natural gas.<br>
feedstock to syngas is well known in the art.   Representative references disclosing<br>
partial oxidation reactors for the production of Syngas include US Pat. No. 2,896,927<br>
to Nagle et al; US Pat. No. 3,920,717 to Marion; US Pat. No. 3,929,429 to Croucih;<br><br>

reference.	<br>
 i[0006] The manufacture  of hydrogen from methanol using a methanol<br><br>
reforming catalyst alone or in conjunction with; a hydrogen-generating shift reactor is<br>
known in the art. Representative references [disclosing this and similar processes<br>
include US Pat. No. 4,175,115 to Ball et al; USJPat. No. 4,316,880 to Jockel et al; US<br>

hereby incorporated herein by reference.	<br><br>
[0007] The manufacture of acetic acid from carbon monoxide and methanol<br><br>
using a carbonylation catalyst is well known in the art, as demonstrated  by<br>
representative references disclosing this and other similar processes including US Pat.<br>

i<br>
herein.	<br>
[0008] The  primary raw materials  for vinyl  acetate  monomer (VAM)<br>
manufacture are ethylene, acetic acid and oxygen.  Carbon dioxide is produced as ian<br>
undesirable byproduct in the reaction and must be removed from the recycled<br>
ethylene.   A significant expense of new production capacity for syngas, methanol,<br><br>
acetic acid and acetic acid derivatives such as VAM, is  the capital cost of  the<br>
necessary equipment.     Other significant expenses  include the operating costs,<br>
including the cost of raw materials.    It would be desirable if these capital and<br><br>
operating costs could be reduced.	<br>
[0009] As far as applicant is aware, there is no disclosure in the prior art for<br>
supplying a methanol feedstock to a partial oxidation reactor to produce hydrogen and<br><br>
carbon monoxide for the synthesis of acetic acid. Further, as far as applicant is aware,<br>
there is no disclosure in the prior art for modifying existing methanol plants haying<br>
partial oxidation reactors to reform a lower alcohol, e.g. methanol, in the presence of<br>
carbon dioxide, oxygen, steam or a combination thereof.	<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION	<br>

syngas from the partial oxidation of methanol for use when the costs of methanol<br><br>
feedstock are low relative to the costs of natural gas, and more particularly to a<br>
method for the preparation of acetic acid from methanol and CO, where the CO is<br>
separated from syngas produced by the partial oxidation of a methanol feedstock.   .<br><br>
[0011] The present invention provides, in one embodiment, a method for<br>

steam, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, cooled and recycled effluent, or mixtures thereof.<br>
The temperature moderator can be a carbon dioxide-rich stream recycled from the<br>
reactor effluent. The partial oxidation reactor  can be catalyst-free and operated at a<br>
temperature between 1100° and 2000°C. Preferably, the partial oxidation reactor can<br>
be operated at a temperature between 1300° and 1500°C.   The method can further<br><br>
include reacting a portion of the methanol feed  stream with the carbon monoxide rich<br>
stream to produce acetic acid. The method can further include the steps of providing<br>
a nitrogen stream from an air separation unit, and supplying the nitrogen stream and<br>
the hydrogen-rich stream to an ammonia synthesis unit to produce ammonia.   The<br>
method can further include the steps of providing an ethylene stream, and supplying<br>
the ethylene stream, oxygen, and acetic acid to a vinyl acetate monomer synthesis unit<br>
 to produce vinyl acetate monomer.   The oxygen supplied to the partial oxidation<br>
reactor and to the vinyl acetate monomer synthesis unit can he provided by a single<br>
air separation unit.	.<br>
[0012] The present invention provides, in another embodiment, a method for<br>
 i<br>
converting an original methanol plant to a converted plant for the synthesis of acetic<br><br>
acid.   The method includes the steps of (a) providing the original methanol plant<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION	<br>
[0024] Detailed embodiments of the present invention are disclosed herein.<br>
However, it is understood that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary, of<br>
the invention, which can be embodied in various forms,   Specific structural and<br>
functional details disclosed herein are not intended to be limiting, but merely<br><br>
illustrations that can be modified within the scope of the attached claims.<br>
		'<br>
[0025] The plant for the process of reforming methanol in a partial oxidation<br><br>
reactor to produce syngas can be a new plant, or it is preferably the retrofit of an<br><br>
existing methanol plant which includes at least one partial oxidation reactor.	<br>
[0026] The present invention provides a solution to the problems associated<br>
	 .<br><br>
with the production of syngas from natural gas when the costs of natural gas are high.<br>
When such economic conditions exist, plants designed for methanol and acetic acid<br>
synthesis can be reconfigured for the production of acetic acid using existing<br>
methanol stock as feed to the reactor, instead of natural gas.	<br>
[0027] The conversion of methanol to carbon monoxide and hydrogen is<br><br>
shown generally by the following reactions:	<br>
  i<br>
If desired, carbon monoxide production can be increased via the reverse shift reaction<br>
(shown below) where carbon dioxide and hydrogen combine to form carbon<br>
monoxide and water.	<br>
  :	' i<br>
[0028] Referring to Fig. 1, a process is provided for the partial oxidation of a<br>
methanol feedstock stream to produce a syngas stream which can be separated into<br>
hydrogen (H2) and carbon monoxide (CO) streams for further use.   A methanol<br><br>
stream 110 is supplied to a catalyst-free partial oxidation (POX) reactor 112 of an<br>
existing methanol synthesis plant, where it lis combined with oxygen 114 and<br>
optionally steam 116.  The methanol stream 110 is preferably a pre-existing purified<br>
feedstock or a commercial methanol product which has been purified by distillation or<br>
another conventional process. The oxygen 114 is obtained from an air separation unit<br>
(ASU) 111, which is supplied with compressed air.   Steam 116 can preferably be<br>
provided by pre-existing facilities. Nitrogen and excess oxygen (not shown) provided<br>
by ASU 111 can be provided to controls.<br><br>
[0029] If oxygen feedstock 114 is not limited, the methanol feedstock 110 can<br>
be supplied to the reactor at room temperature.; If supplies of oxygen 114 are limited,<br>
however, the methanol feedstock 110 can be preheated and/or vaporized (not shown)<br>
prior to supplying to the POX reactor 112. When room temperature methanol 110 is<br><br>
supplied to the partial oxidation reactor 112 with an excess of oxygen 114, hydrogen<br>
content in the syngas effluent 118 is reduced.	<br>
[0030] POX reactor 112 can produce a syngas effluent 118 consisting of H2,<br>
CO and C02. The effluent 118 is generally [cleaner than syngas produced from a<br>
natural gas feed as much of the impurities were removed during synthesis of the<br>
methanol feed stream 110. Effluent 118, after cooling, can be fed to C02 separation<br>
unit 120 which produces a C02-rich stream 122 and a mixed CO/H2 stream 124<br><br>
essentially free of C02.   The C02-rich stream 122 can be vented and the mixed<br>
CO/H2 stream 124 can be supplied to separation unit 126.	<br>
[0031] Separation unit  126 preferably includes molecular sieves  and  a<br><br>
conventional cold box.  The separation unit 126 splits the mixed stream 124 into at<br>
least a CO-rich stream 128 and an H2-rich stream 130, but can also include minor<br>
amounts of one or more residual or tail gas streams of mixed H2 and CO which can<br>
be used as fuel or exported (not shown). The CO-rich stream 128 and H2-rich stream<br><br>
130 can be supplied to alternate processes, such as, for example, acetic acid synthesis<br>
units or ammonia synthesis units, respectively, which are further discussed below.   <br><br>
[0032] As shown in Fig. 2, CO-rich stream 128 can be supplied to an acetic<br>
acid synthesis unit 132 where it is combined with a methanol stream 134, which can<br><br>
be obtained from the same feedstock that supplies the POX reactor 112. The acetic<br>
acid synthesis unit 132 can employ manufacturing equipment and methodology well<br>
known and/or commercially available to those! skilled in the art to form acetic acid<br><br><br>
136 from CO via stream 128 and methanol via stream 134, such as, for example, from<br>
one or more of the acetic acid manufacturing patents mentioned above. For example,<br>
a conventional BP/Monsanto process can be employed, or an improved BP/Monsanto<br>
process employing BP-Cativa technology (iridium catalyst), Celanese low water<br>
technology (rhodium-lithium acetate catalyst), Millennium low water technology<br>
(rhodium-phosphorous oxide catalyst) and/or dual process methanol carbonylation-<br>
methyl formate isomerization. The reaction generally comprises reacting methanol,<br>
methyl formate, or a combination thereof; in the presence of a reaction mixture<br>
comprising carbon monoxide, water, a solvent and a catalyst system comprising at<br>
least one halogenated promoter and at least one compound of rhodium, iridium, or a<br>
combination thereof.	<br>
[0033] The reaction mixture for the acetic acid synthesis preferably has a<br>
water content of less than 20 weight percent more preferably between approximately<br>
14 and 15 weight percent. When the reaction comprises low water carbonylation, ithe<br>
water content in the reaction mixture is preferably from abbut 2 to about 8 weight<br>
percent. When the reaction comprises methyl formate isomerization or a combination<br>
i.<br>
of isomerization and methanol carbonylation, the reaction mixture preferably contains<br><br>
a nonzero quantity of water up to 2 weight percent.<br>
[0034] As shown in Fig. 3, the process can optionally include an ammonia<br>
■	i'<br>
synthesis unit 144, designed to take advantage of the H2 from the syngas stream 118<br><br>
and nitrogen from the ASU 111. All or a portion of hydrogen stream 130 from the<br>
CO/H2 separation unit 126 is reacted with ah N2 stream 142 from the air separation<br>
unit to form ammonia collected in stream 146. Ammonia output from the synthesis<br>
unit 144 can be increased by increasing hydrogen feed, br by adding a second<br>
ammonia synthesis unit (not shown).	<br><br>
[0035] As shown in Fig. 4, the process) can optionally include a vinyl acetate<br>
■	:|<br>
monomer (VAM) synthesis unit 156. A portion of the acetic acid from line 136 can<br>
be fed via line 150 to an the VAM synthesis unit 156 where it can be reacted with<br>
ethylene 152 via line 154 and at least a portionjof the oxygen 113 from air separation<br>
unit 111. A liquid product stream 158 is processed via conventional VAM distillation<br>
unit 160 to produce essentially pure (commercial specification) VAM via line 162.<br>
Carbon dioxide produced as a byproduct of the  VAM synthesis can be separated from<br>
the reactor effluent gases via a conventional C02 removal system (not shown) and<br>
recycled to the POX reactor 112 via line 164.	<br><br>
[0036] VAM production can be mainly achieved by the acetoxylation of<br>
i<br>
ethylene according to the reaction:	<br><br>
The main by-product C02 is formed by the reaction<br>
  ■ i<br>
Selectivity for the process yields approximately 7-8% C02 by mass.   Typically, a<br><br>
VAM plant producing approximately 100,000 metric tons per year (MTY) of  VAM<br><br>
requires approximately 35,000 MTY of ethylene and produces between 5,000 and<br>
10,000 MTY of C02.	<br>
[0037] As shown in Fig. 5, a vinyl acetate synthesis unit 156 can be added to.<br>
	j,<br>
the existing acetic acid synthesis unit 132 and ammonia synthesis unit 144 for optimal<br>
usage of the syngas stream.   The VAM synthesis unit 156 can be supplied with a<br>
portion of the acetic acid product stream 136j via line 1501 for the synthesis of !the<br><br>
monomer.  Crude VAM exits the VAM synthesis unit 156 via line 158 and enters a<br><br><br>
distillation unit 160 to produce a product stream 162.  Carbon dioxide produced as a<br>
byproduct of the VAM synthesis can be separated from the reactor effluent gases via a<br><br>
conventional C02 removal system (not shown) and recycled to the POX reactor 112<br><br>
via line 164.	<br>
[0038] As shown in Fig. 6, all or a portion of the carbon dioxide 222 produced<br>
and separated from the syngas effluent 218 and recycled to the POX reactor 212. A<br>
methanol stream 210 is supplied to the partial oxidation (POX) reactor 212 of an<br><br>
existing methanol synthesis plant, where it is combined with oxygen 214 and carbon<br>
dioxide 222. The methanol stream 210 is preferably a pre-existing methanol<br>
feedstock which has been previously purified by distillation; or another conventional<br>
process (not shown). The oxygen 214 is obtained from pre-existing air separation unit<br>
(ASU) 211, which is fed with air compressed. Carbon dioxide 222 can be produced<br><br>
in the reformation of the methanol 210 and can be recycled to the reactor 212 feed.<br>
![0039] POX reactor 212 can produce a syngas effluent 218 consisting of H2,<br>
CO and C02.   The effluent 218 is generally cleaner than syngas produced from a<br><br>
natural gas feed as much of the impurities are removed during synthesis of the<br>
feedstock. Effluent 218, after cooling, can be fed to C02 separation unit 220 which<br>
produces a C02-rich stream 222 and a mixed|CO/H2 stream 224 essentially free of<br>
C02.   The C02-rich stream 222 can be recycled to the POX reactor 212 and the<br>
mixed CO/H2 stream 224 is supplied to separation unit 226. Recycle of the C02-rich<br>
stream to the POX reactor can increase CO production between approximately 5-10%<br><br>
and decrease hydrogen production between approximately 3-8%. When the C02 is<br>
recycled to the POX reactor, for a given  production rate, the methanol feed<br>
requirement is thus reduced.<br>
[0040] Separation unit 226 preferably includes molecular sieves andj a<br>
conventional cold box. The separation unit  226 splits the stream 224 into at least a<br>
CO-rich stream 228 and an H2-rich stream 230, but can also include minor amounts<br><br>
of one or more residual or tail gas streams of mixed H2 and CO which can be used as<br>
fuel, recycled to the reactor, or exported (not shwn).<br>
[0041] As shown in Fig. 7, CO-rich stream 228 can be combined with a<br>
stoichiometric amount of the methanol feedstock 234 to yield acetic acid 236, by a<br>
synthetic process which has been described aove. As show in Fig. 8, the H2-rich<br><br>
stream 230 can be reacted with nitrogen 242 from ASU 240 in an ammonia synthesis<br>
unit 244 to yield ammonia product 246. Alternatively, all or a portion of the H2-rich<br>
stream can be supplied as fuel or exported to an alternate process (not shown).<br>
[0042] As shown in Fig. 9, the process can optionally include a vinyl acetate<br>
monomer (VAM) synthesis unit 256. A portion of the acetic acid from line 236 can<br>
be fed via line 250 to an the VAM synthesis unit 256 where rt is reacted with ethylene<br>
252 via line 254 and at least a portion of the oxygen 213 from air separation unit 211.<br><br>
A liquid product stream 258 can be processed via conventional VAM distillation unit<br>
260 to produce essentially pure (commercial specification) VAM via line 262.<br>
Carbon dioxide produced as a byproduct of the! VAM synthesis can be separated from<br>
the reactor effluent gases via a conventional C02 removal system (not shown) and<br>
recycled, to the POX reactor 212 via line 264.	<br>
[0043] As shown in Fig. 10, a vinyl acetate synthesis unit 256 can be added to<br><br>
the existing acetic acid synthesis unit 232 and ammonia synthesis unit 244 for optimal<br><br>
usage of the syngas stream. VAM synthesis unit 256 can be supplied with a portion<br><br>
of the acetic acid product stream 236 via line 250, ethylene 252 via line 254, and<br><br>
oxygen from the ASU 211 via line 213. Crude VAM exits the VAM synthesis unit<br><br>
256 via line 258 and enters a distillation unit 260 to produce a product stream 262.<br><br>
Carbon dioxide produced as a byproduct of the   VAM synthesis can be separated from<br>
the reactor effluent gases via a conventional C02 removal system (not shown) and<br><br><br>
recycled to the POX reactor 212 via line 264.	,<br><br>
[0044] Utilities (not shown), which typically include the steam system,<br><br>
cooling water, compressed air and the like, can be supplied from a pre-existing<br>
methanol plant and can be used to supply an associated processes, such as, for<br>
example, acetic acid and ammonia synthesis units, as well. Steam generated by waste<br>
heat recovery from the acetic acid synthesis unit 132 and/or any other associated<br>
integrated unit, can be used to drive or supply steam to water pumps (not shown),<br>
ASU compressor 111, POX reactor 112, C02 removal unit 12:0, and the like.	<br>
[0045] The partial oxidation reactors can be unpacked, free-flow, rion<br>
.catalytic gas generators to which preheated hydrocarbon and oxygen are supplied.<br><br><br>
Optionally, a temperature moderator can be supplied to the reactor as well.   The<br>
partial oxidation reactor effluent is then quenched or cooled, and optionally cleaned to<br><br>
remove soot and other particulate impuritids, and can be further processed;  or<br><br>
separated for additional downstream uses.   When hydrogen gas is the desired end<br><br>
product, such as, for example, for ammonia synthesis reactors, high and low<br>
temperature shift converters can be employed to convert CO and steam to hydrogen<br>
and C02. Where carbon monoxide is the desired end product, such as, for example,<br>
for acetic acid synthesis reactors, any C02 can be removed and recycled to the reactor<br><br><br>
to increase CO production, or reverse shift reabtors can be employed to convert C02<br>
and H2 to CO and H2O.	<br>
[0046] When the partial oxidation reactor is from ;a pre-existing methanol<br>
plant, the burner can be adjusted for operation for use with a methanol feedstock. The<br>
partial oxidation reactor temperature can be maintained from 1100°- 2000°C ( 2000°-<br>
3600°F), preferably from 1300°- 1500°C ( 240!o°- 2700°F). The reactor pressure can<br>
be maintained at between 2 and 6 MPa, preferably approximately 4 MPa.<br><br><br><br>
[0047] The production of syngas from liquid and solid carbon materials can<br><br>
often result in the presence of many unwanted! impurities, such as for example, CO2,<br>
S02, COS, CH4, Ar, N2, H20 and NH3. Typically, when natural gas is used as the<br>
feedstock for the production of syngas, a desulfurizing/saturation unit with a catalyst<br>
bed, such as, for example, nickel/molybdenum catalyst can be used to remove sulfur<br><br>
.<br>
from feed prior to supplying to the reactor.   Because the natural gas used in,the<br>
synthesis of the methanol has already desulfurized and the methanol product ihas<br>
already been purified by distillation or another conventional purification process,<br>
many of the undesired impurities normally present from synthesis with natural gas are<br>
effectively eliminated from the syngas product.	<br>
[0048] The effluent from the partial oxidation has a molar ratio of H2-C02 to<br>
CO+C02   (referred   to   in   the   present   specification   as   the   R   ratio"   (H2-<br>
C02)/(CO+C02)), which can be optimized for the production of CO. Generally, for<br>
the production of methanol, an R ratio of approximately 2.0 is desired.   For  the<br>
	'	<br>
synthesis of syngas high in CO, the H2 to CO ratio can range from 1.5 to 3, and<br>
preferably between 1.5 and 2.	<br>
[0049] Suitable temperature moderators, to control the reaction conditions,<br>
can be added to the reaction zone and can include H20, CO2, and N2 from the air<br><br>
:		|<br>
separation unit, flue gas, cooled and recycled effluent gas, arid mixtures thereof. The<br>
need for a temperature moderator is generally driven by the carbon:hydrogen ratio of<br><br>
the hydrocarbon feed and the presence of free oxygen.  Preferably, the temperature<br><br>
moderator can include a portion of C02 cooled and separated from the partial<br>
oxidation reactor effluent and recycled back to the reactor feed.  When steam is used<br><br>
as the temperature moderator, control of the flow rate can limit or prevent the<br>
production of soot in the reactor.	<br><br>
[0050] The C02 removal unit separates the effluent stream into a C02-rich<br>
and a C02-lean stream using conventional C02 separation equipment and<br>
methodology, such as, for example, a.bsorption stripping with a solvent such as water,<br>
methanol, generally aqueous alkanolamines such as ethanolamine, diethanolamine,<br>
methyldiethanolamine and the like, aqueous alkali carbonates such as sodium and<br>
potassium carbonates, and the like. Such C02 absorption-stripping processes :are<br>
commercially available under the trade designations Girbotol, Sulfinol, Rectisol,<br>
Purisol, Fluor, BASF (aMDEA) and the like.	    <br>
[0051] The C02-lean stream contains primarily CO and hydrogen and can be<br>
separated in a CO separation unit into CO-rich and hydrogen-rich streams. The<br>
separation unit can comprise any equipment and/or methodologies known in the art<br>
for separating the CO and hydrogen mixture into relatively pure CO and hydrogen<br>
streams, such as, for example, semi-permeable membranes, cryogenic fractionation,<br>
or the like. Cryogenic fractional distillation! is preferred, land can include simple<br>
partial condensation without any columns, optionally with a pressure swing<br>
absorption (PSA) unit and a hydrogen recycle (compressor , or methane wash. Partial<br>
condensation with columns is typically sufficient for obtaining CO and hydrogen of<br>
sufficient purity for acetic acid and ammonia production, respectively, keeping the<br>
equipment and operating costs to a minimum; The PSA unit and hydrogen recycle<br>
compressor can be added for increasing the hydrogen purity and CO production rates<br>
if desired. For the manufacture of acetic acid, the CO stream preferably contains less<br>
than 1000 ppm hydrogen and less than 2 mole percent nitrogen plus methane. For<br>
ammonia production, the hydrogen stream which is sent to a nitrogen wash unit (not<br><br>
shown) preferably contains at least 80 mol% hydrogen, and more preferably contains<br>
at least 95 mol% hydrogen.	<br><br>
[0052] Example 1. A methanol feedstock stream is supplied to a partial<br>
oxidation reactor for the recovery of hydrogen! and carbon monoxide. The methanol<br>
stream is supplied at a rate of 1438 kmoles/hour, where it is combined with 719<br>
kmoles/hour of oxygen and 884 kmoles/hour of steam. The partial oxidation reactor<br>
is operated at approximately 1300CC (2372 °F) and 4 MPa, producing a syrigas<br>
effluent stream. Carbon dioxide can be removed from the syngas stream, producing a<br><br>
carbon dioxide-rich stream and a carbon dioxide-lean stream of carbon monoxide and<br><br>
hydrogen.   The carbon dioxide-rich stream can be vented or collected.  The carbon<br>
dioxide-lean stream can be supplied to a cold bbx where the component hydrogen and<br>
carbon monoxide are separated, yielding 1045 kmoles/hour of carbon monoxide and<br>
1812 kmoles/hour of hydrogen.	<br>
[0053] Example 2. A methanol feedstock stream is fed to a partial oxidation<br>
reactor for recovery of hydrogen and carbon monoxide.   The methanol stream is<br>
supplied at a rate of 1438 kmoles/hour, where it is combined with 719 kmoles/hour of<br>
oxygen, 350 kmoles/hour of steam, and 296 kmoles/hour of carbon dioxide recycled<br><br>
from the reactor effluent. The partial oxidation reactor operates at approximately<br>
1400°C (2552°F) and 4 MPa, producing a syngas effluent stream. Carbon dioxide is<br>
removed from the syngas stream by known means, producing a carbon dioxide-rich<br>
stream and a carbon dioxide-lean stream of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The<br>
carbon dioxide-rich stream is recycled to the partial oxidation reactor at a rate of 296<br>
kmoles/hour.   The carbon dioxide-lean stream is supplied to a cold box where the<br><br>
components are separated, yielding 1045 kmoles/hour of carbon monoxide and 1812<br><br>
kmoles/hour of hydrogen.<br>

operating conditions of Example 1.   A stoichiometric amount of methanol (1045<br><br>
kmoles/hour) is added to the carbon monoxide-rich stream (1045 kmoles/hour) in an<br>
acetic acid synthesis unit to produce approximately 1045 kmoles/hour of acetic acid.<br>
[0055] Example 4.   The production of acetic acid from a plant having; the<br>
operating conditions of Example 2.   A stoichiometric amount of methanol (1:134<br><br>
