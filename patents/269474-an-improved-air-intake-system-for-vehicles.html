PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in<br>
which it is to be performed.<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to vehicles in general and more particularly it relates to the air intake system with better efficiency of water separation.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In vehicles the air intake system is required to supply the desired quantity of air required for combustion.<br>
In commercial vehicles, a long-standing practice has been to provide a conduit system to deliver fresh air from out side an engine compartment to the engine for combustion. Also separate air entries were provided for cabin and air intake system. For many years a relatively standard practice was to mount an air filter on the exterior of a vehicle cowl. Such an external air filter was coupled to the engine's intake manifold by a suitable conduit system. Air entry for air intake system is either inside engine hood or from the sidewall of vehicle cowl or alternatively air intake system is mounted on the backside of cowl and fresh air is provided with the help of long duct. Due to the increase in demand for economy of operation and less space availability between cowl &amp; load body, the air filters are shifted to inside of either cowl or engine hood of the vehicles.<br>
Fig.l shows a schematic layout of conventional air intake system, which comprises air filter (5), Pipe (3), connecting hoses (2, 4) and turbocharger (1). Said air intake system is provided in an engine compartment (9). Air from atmosphere is supplied to the engine compartment (9) through the front grill (7) said air being cleaned through an air filter &amp; then clean air is supplied to engine through connecting hoses (2,4) &amp; pipe (3).<br><br><br>
In conventional systems a separate air entry (10) for cabin (8) is provided at front<br>
of vehicle through duct (6).<br>
Main drawback of said conventional system is that the fresh air is not available at<br>
the inlet of filter (11) as air filter mounting is provided inside the engine hood, and<br>
the fresh air gets mixed with re circulated hot air inside engine compartment<br>
because of which the temperature of air which is entering to the filter is high<br>
which has impact on fuel economy.<br>
In order to overcome the said drawbacks this invention is devised.<br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION<br>
The main object of this invention is to provide Novel Air intake system for<br>
vehicles, which is able to supply fresh air from atmosphere at an ambient<br>
temperature to engine in order to increase fuel economy &amp; engine components<br>
life.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide a Novel Air intake system for<br>
vehicles, which has got a common air entry for cabin as well as engine.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide a Novel Air intake system for<br>
vehicles, with water separator to supply moisture free air to engine.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide a Novel Air intake system for<br>
vehicles, which is simple in construction and cost effective.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
Novel air intake system for vehicles in accordance with this invention basically comprises of an air intake duct, grill, water separator, air filter, plurality of connecting hoses, connecting pipe and turbo charger. Said duct is branched in two streams, one for cabin and other for engine. Said duct is also provided with small<br><br><br>
"U shape" snorkel on its surface for air entry without moisture. Said water separator is provided with at least two baffles inside its housing and is provided in inclined manner in such a way that it gives flow effect to the air entered &amp; removes water with better efficiency &amp; less pressure drop. Said water separator is also provided with plurality of drain hole at its lower most bottom surface.<br>
Front surface of said duct is connected with grill provided on front of vehicle and one branch is connected to the cabin through hose and another branch is connected to the water separator with the help of connecting hose. Said water separator is connected to the said filter through hose and said filter is connected to engine via turbocharger through connecting hoses and pipe.<br>
Air entry to the duct splits into two parts, percentage of air entry goes to cabin &amp; rest of air goes to air intake system. Water separator is connected to the duct with the help of hose &amp; from water separator hose is connected to the air filter entry. Said air being cleaned through an air filter &amp; then clean air is supplied to engine through connecting hoses &amp; pipe.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Referring now to the drawings wherein the showings are for the purpose of illustrating a preferred embodiment of the invention only, and not for the purpose of limiting the same.<br>
Referring to figures 2 to 4<br>
Novel air intake system for vehicles in accordance with this invention basically comprises of an air intake duct (14), grill (15), water separator (18), air filter (27), plurality of connecting hoses (19, 20, 29, and 30), connecting pipe (28) and turbo charger (31). Said duct (14) is branched in two streams (16, 17), one stream (16) for cabin and other stream (17) for engine. Said duct (14) is also provided with small "U shape" snorkel (32) on its surface for air entry without moisture. Said water separator (18) is provided with at least two baffles (33, 34) inside its housing (35) and is provided in inclined manner in such a way that it gives flow effect to the air entered &amp; removes water with better efficiency &amp; less pressure drop. Said water separator (18) is also provided with plurality of drain holes (22) at its lower most bottom surface.<br>
Front surface of said duct (14) is connected with grill (15) provided on front of vehicle and one stream (16) is connected to the cabin through hose and another stream (17) is connected to the water separator (18) with the help of connecting hose (19). Said water separator (18) is connected to the said filter (27) through hose (20) and said filter (27) is connected to engine via turbocharger (31) through connecting hoses (29, 30) and pipe (28).<br>
Air entry (13) to the duct (14) splits into two parts, percentage of air entry goes to cabin &amp; rest of air goes to air intake system. Water separator (18) is connected to the duct (14) with the help of hose (19) &amp; from water separator hose (20) is<br><br><br>
connected to the air filter entry (21). Said air being cleaned through an air filter (27)&amp; then clean air is supplied to engine through connecting hoses (29,30) &amp; pipe (28).<br>
During operation fresh moist air enters through air entry (13) to the duct (14) which is connected to the front grill (15) of vehicle, said air splits into two streams, percentage of air goes to cabin through stream (16) &amp; rest of air goes to air intake system through stream (17). In order to prevent the damage of engine due to the high suction velocity of air with moisture said water separator is provided. Said water separator removes water from the moist air &amp; drains through the holes (22) in the water separator housing (35).<br>
Said water separator is provided with baffles (33, 34) said baffles are placed inclined in such a way that it gives flow effect to the air entered (25) &amp; removes water with higher efficiency &amp; less pressure drop. The said outlet air (26) goes to intake system without moisture. The common air entry to air intake system &amp; cabin gives compactness to the system. Fresh air at low temperature as intake gives advantage to fuel economy &amp; engine components life. Clean air then passes through air intake system &amp; engine combustion chamber.<br>
As holes on the bottom surface of water separation chamber allows continuous drain of water from separation chamber so that no probability of collected water entering to the engine intake exists.<br>
The foregoing description is a specific embodiment of the present invention. It should be appreciated that this embodiment is described for purpose of illustration only, and that numerous alterations and modifications may be practiced by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. It is intended that all such modifications and alterations be included insofar as they come within the scope of the invention as claimed or the equivalents thereof.<br><br><br>
