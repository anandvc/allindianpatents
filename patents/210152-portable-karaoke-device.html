FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates in general to portable karaoke devices, and more particularly to a portable karaoke device which is capable of allowing the user to sing over a main microphone or auxiliary microphone and listen to his song mixed with an accompaniment sound through an audio unit while viewing a background picture with a lyrics caption through a video unit, of temporarily storing a tune downloaded through a moving picture experts group 2 (MPEG 2) layer 3 (MPS) technique or communication interface in its internal sound module to use the stored tune as an accompaniment sound, and of varying the phase and the harmony of the accompaniment sound to output a modulated accompaniment sound, so that the user can conveniently and simply use the device with no necessity for replacing a sound memory in which lyrics and accompaniments of newest songs are previously recorded and a video memory that provides a background picture, a plurality of users can use the device simultaneously, and the user's song can be stored and then listened later sent through the Internet in the form of a music letter.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE RELATED ART<br>
As well known in the art, accompaniment devices are adapted to store data about accompaniments of a large number of tunes in their internal memories. If the user selects a desired one of the tunes, then the associated accompaniment device outputs a sound of an accompaniment associated with the selected tune through a speaker at the same time that it inputs a song voice of the user through a microphone and outputs it through the speaker. As a result, people can simply practice singing with the accompaniment devices. However, people have to purchase the above-mentioned accompaniment devices at great expense and cannot use them at any places other than their installed places, because most of the accompaniment devices basically comprise monitor screens mounted integrally therewith and are usually installed within rooms. For these reasons, in order to use the accompaniment devices, people must search<br><br>
for places where the accompaniment devices have already been installed. In order to overcome the above problems, there has been proposed a portable wireless accompaniment system comprising a plurality of expandable read only memory (ROM) packages for assigning numbers respectively to tunes desired by the user and storing accompaniments of the tunes in the form of digital signals, in the proposed accompaniment system, a microprocessor is operated synchronously with an oscillation frequency from an oscillator and in response to a tune number and other items applied through a key matrix by the user. The microprocessor is adapted to control the entire system operation according to routines stored in a program memory. Further, the microprocessor stores data related to a played tune in a memory and displays the current operation state on a display unit through liquid crystal display (LCD) driver. Further, the microprocessor controls a multiplexer, a D-type flip-flop, a ROM package and other components in the system in response to a tune selection thorough the key matrix by the user. A dual sound controller reproduces a stereo accompaniment sound, which is then amplified by an amplifier. An echo generator is adapted to selectively output an echo sound of mechanical vibration waves. A tone controller controls a tone of the echo sound from the echo generator, which is then mixed with a stereo audio signal from a microphone terminal, A gain controller controls a gain of the mixed signal and an audio amplifier amplifies the resultant audio signal together with the amplified stereo accompaniment sound from the above amplifier. A radio frequency (RF) modulator modulates the amplified audio and accompaniment signals at a predetermined radio frequency. As a result, a synthetic melody signal is obtained by mixing the audio signal and accompaniment signal and then transmitted by radio to an external audio unit through an antenna. As an alternative, there has been proposed a portable wireless video accompaniment system wherein lyrics caption data is outputted to a video unit together with a background video signal at the same time that an accompaniment sound of a selected tune is outputted to an audio unit while being mixed with a voice inputted through a microphone, thereby allowing the user to sing to the accompaniment sound while viewing lyrics on a background picture.<br><br>
However, the above-mentioned conventional portable wireless accompaniment system and portable wireless video accompaniment system are advantageous in that they can be conveniently carried and used by the user, but have the following disadvantages. Firstly, the existing ROM packages must be replaced with new ones whenever new tunes are added. Secondly, the user cannot personally select a desired background picture and is thus liable to fee! repugnance toward the same background picture being continuously repeated. Thirdly, the user cannot select or reserve a next tune while singing over a microphone of the system body as a result, it requires the user to spend extra time manipulating the controls to select or reserve a next tune. The portable karaoke device of Korean Patent application No. 2000-28847 (registered as Korean Patent No. 336465) filed by the applicant stores accompaniments of songs desired by the user including accompaniments downloaded through an MPS decoder in an extendable sound unit, outputs a video signal mixed with a lyrics caption to a video unit by radio while using a video signal that is transmitted from the video unit by radio as a background picture to allow the user to view the background picture and lyric caption, and includes an auxiliary microphone that radio-transmits signals in addition to a main microphone used for the user to sing a song with the associated accompaniment sound to allow the user to select and input a next song while singing over the auxiliary micropnohe, so that the user can conveniently and efficiently use the device with no necessity for replacing a sound unit in which lyrics and accompaniments of newest songs are previously recorded and a video memory that provides a background picture. However, such a portable karaoke device cannot download desired songs through the Internet and it is difficult for the device to modify accompaniment sounds. Accordingly, there has been a problem in that the device cannot satisfy users who want to use it in various ways.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore, the present invention has been made in view of the above problems, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a portable wireless<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Fig. 1 is a block diagram schematically showing the entire construction of a portable karaoke device in accordance with the present invention. As shown in this drawing, the karaoke device comprises a sound module 1 mounted in an ASIC 4 for assigning arbitrary numbers respectively to given tunes and storing accompaniments of the tunes and a download memory 2. The sound module 1 has an internal memory la and an extension pack 90. Tunes are stored in the internal memory la and extension pack 90 of the sound module 1 and the download memory 2 in the form of digital signals such that additional tunes can be stored in therein. The karaoke device further comprises an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) 4 including the sound module 1 and a microprocessor that are operated synchronously with an oscillation frequency from a crystal oscillator and in response to a tune number and other items applied through a key matrix 3 by the user. The microprocessor 31 in the ASIC 4 is adapted to control the entire system operation according to routines stored in a storage unit 5. Further, the microprocessor 31 stores data related to a played tune in a random access memory (RAM) 6 and displays the current operation state on an LCD 7 through an LCD driver (not shown). The storage unit 5 may preferably include a program memory OS-ROM 5a for storing the routines for the control of the system operation, a character memory FONT-ROM 5b for storing<br><br>
and outputting characters in the form of digital signals, a tune memory DATA-ROM 5c for compressing, storing and outputting music data in a musical instrument digital interface (MIDI) format, and a video memory GRAPHIC-ROM 5d for storing and outputting a video signal in the form of a digital signal. In response to a tune selection through the key matrix 3 by the user, the microprocessor 31 in the ASIC 4 outputs an accompaniment sound of a corresponding tune stored in the internal sound module 1, the external extension pack 90, or download memory 2 to a rendering unit 8. A musical instrument sound memory 9 samples 128 musical instrument sounds to convert analog audio signals corresponding to the 128 musical instrument sounds into digital audio signals and stores the digital audio signals. The musical instrument memory 9 simultaneously mixes maximum 36 musical instrument sounds among 128 sounds and outputs the mixed sound. The rendering unit 8 varies the phase and/or harmony of an accompaniment sound transmitted from the sound module 1, the external extension pack 90, or download memory 2 to selectively modulate the accompaniment sound according to the musical instrument sound outputted from the musical instrument sound memory 9 and outputs the modulated accompaniment sound. The accompaniment sound modulated by the rendering unit 8 is sent to a mixer 10. A main microphone 11 is adapted to input a users song voice, convert it into an electrical signal and output the resultant audio signal. An amplifier/limiter circuit 12 functions to amplify the audio signal from the main microphone 11 and limit the amplitude of the amplified audio signal to a predetermined level. The amplified audio signal is mixed with an accompaniment sound by the mixer 10 and then selectively stored in a flash memory 2a. The audio signal mixed with the accompaniment sound, which is stored in the flash memory 2a and then read or directly outputted, is transmitted through an A-D/D-A converter 13 to a low pass filter 14, which then passes only frequency band components lower than 20KHz to remove sampling noise components higher than 20KHz from the audio signal. An output amplifier 15 amplifies data of the frequency band components lower than 20 KHz from the low pass filter 14 and transfers the resultant audio signal to an RF amplifier 16, which then modulates the audio signal into an RF signal and transmits the modulated RF signal to an<br><br>

Further, the internal video transmitter/receiver circuit 24 receives a radio frequency signal through the internal video transmission/reception antenna 25, converts the received radio frequency signal into an intermediate frequency signal, detects as external video signal from the converted intermediate frequency signal and outputs the detected video signal to the ASIC 4. An<br><br>
external video transmitter/receiver circuit 29 is adapted to transmit or receive a radio frequency signal to or from the internal video transmission/reception antenna 25. The external video transmitter/receiver circuit 29 receives a background video signal from a video reproduction unit 30 such as a VCD, LDP or VCR and transmits the received video signal as the external video signal to the internal video transmitter/receiver circuit 24 through an external video transmission/reception antenna 31 at a radio frequency controlled by a frequency controller. Further, the external video transmitter/receiver circuit 29 receives the radio frequency signal form the internal video transmitter/receiver circuit 24 through the external video transmission/reception antenna 31, converts the received radio frequency signal into an intermediate frequency signal, detects the internal video signal form the converted intermediate frequency signal and outputs the detected video signal to a television (TV) 32. An MP3 decoder 33 under the control of the ASIC 4 is selectively connected to a personal computer (PC) 34 to download data about an accompaniment sound and lyrics of a new tune and store the download data in the download memory 2 and then output it.<br>
A communication interface 35 that operates under the control of the ASIC 4 is<br>
connected to the PC 34 to be selectively linked with a sen/er 37 through a<br>
wired/wireless communication network 36 to download data about an<br>
accompaniment sound and lyrics of a new tune and store the downloaded data<br>
in the download memory 2. The communication interface 35 transmits the user's<br>
audio signal mixed with the accompaniment sound, stored in the flash memory<br>
2a, to a receiving party through the server 37 as a music letter. Although not<br>
shown, a power supply is provided to supply a direct current (DC) voltage from a<br>
battery in the karaoke device or an external DC voltage as a system drive<br>
