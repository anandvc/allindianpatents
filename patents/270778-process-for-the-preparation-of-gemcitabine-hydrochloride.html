3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner<br>
in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
Technical Field of Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a new improved process for the preparation of Gemcitabine Hydrochloride (2'-deoxy-2’, 2'-difluorocytidine hydrochloride).<br>
Background and prior art of Invention:<br>
Gemcitabine Hydrochloride is a nucleoside analogue that exhibits anti-tumor activity and belongs to a general group of chemotherapy drug known as anti-metabolites. Gemcitabine prevents cells from producing DNA and RNA by interfering with the synthesis of nucleic acid, thus stopping the growth of cancer cells and causing them to die.<br>
Gemcitabine is a synthetic glucoside analog of cytosine, which is chemically described as, 4-amino-l-(2-deoxy-2,2-difluoro-b-D-ribofuranosyl)-pyrimidin-2(lH)-one or 2’-deoxy-2’2’-difluorocytidine (b isomer). The key intermediate of Gemcitabine is 3,5-diprotected-2-deoxy-2,2-difluoro-b-D-ribofuranose and has the following structure (II)<br><br>
P = protecting group<br>
There are generally, two synthetic routes of Gemcitabine. US Pat. No.4526988, 4808614, 5223608 and J.Org.Chem. (1988, 2406) describes successful process using Reformatsky Reaction (between ethyl 2-bromide-2, 2-difluoro acetate and 2,3-O-isopropylidene-D-glyceraldehyde) as key step. The process described as follows:<br><br>
US Pat. No. 6001994 describes another process as the aldol reaction (between t-butyl 2-bromide-2,2-difluoro thioacetate and 2,3-O-isopropylidene-D-glycer-aldehyde) as key step. The process illustrated as follows:<br><br><br>
The above mentioned processes involve condensation reaction which result in a mixture of isomers and further gives low yield of desired key intermediate of Gemcitabine i.e. 3, 5-diprotected-2-deoxy-2,2-difluoro-b-D-ribofuranose (II). So, there is a need to develop a new process for preparation of key intermediate i.e. 3, 5-diprotected-2-deoxy-2,2-difluoro-b-D-ribofuranose (II) and Gemcitabine. HC1 which, is simple, high yielding, and can be carried out at industrial scale by using mild reaction conditions.<br>

To a solution of 8c (~32g) in methanol (250ml), cooled in ice-water bath, solid sodium methoxide (12g) was added in portions. After the addition, the cooling bath was removed and the reaction mixture was warmed to room temperature. After the reaction was<br><br><br>
complete, the mixture was cooled in ice-water bath. To this, the mixture of methanol (100ml) and HCl (8.2g) was added. After stirring for 30 minutes, the sodium chloride formed was filtered off. Again mixture of methanol (50ml) and HCl (4.1g) was added and was stirred for 30 minutes. The residual obtained was concentrated and was recrystallized from acetone and water to obtain Gemcitabine Hydrochloride (15g).<br><br><br>
