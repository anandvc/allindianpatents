				<td>The invention relates to an apparatus for wrapping at least one cylindrical product roll, rotatably mounted about a bearing axis in a receiving and driving device and provided with two front faces and one outer surface, using a plastic stretch film affixed unreliably on a spatially movable film head which is arranged on a movable bearing device, wherein the apparatus has automatic computer-assisted position control of the film head.<br>
Such an apparatus is known from US 5 203 139. The apparatus has a rotatable turret assembly provided with a plurality of driven pins on which product rolls are in turn rotatably mounted. In one film head an unreliable film roll is mounted such that it is linearly movable in three spatial directions and swivellable about two axes. With the aid of this apparatus it is possible to package a product roll with film whilst another product roll is wound and for example, a third already packaged film roll is removed from the rotatable turret assembly. In this way it is possible to continue the packaging process continuously without waiting for the product rolls to be changed.<br>
The disadvantage of this apparatus is that smaller product rolls such as film rolls can be packaged using this rotatable turret assembly but not heavy film rolls onto which metal foil or steel sheet are wound. In addition, the mobility of the film head is restricted. The apparatus is also worthy of improvement with regard to the flexibility in relation to different product roll sizes and the precision of the winding process.<br>
Furthermore, such a device is known from DE 691 06 801. In this apparatus the film roll is arranged on a film head which can be swivelled about two axes. In addition, the film head is mounted on a support such it is vertically<br>
displaceable by means of a linear guide. The product to be packaged is located on a rotary table which is rotatable about an axis by means of a drive. A disadvantage with this apparatus is that the film head has a very limited flexibility of movement. Thus, optimal wrapping adapted to the product is not always possible. This apparatus also has disadvantages with regard to flexibility for different product roll dimensions, packaging capacity and precision of the packaging process.<br>
On the basis of the aforesaid prior art, it is thus the object of the invention to provide an apparatus with which an improved flexibility of the packaging process as well as a higher capacity and greater flexibility in relation to different product roll dimensions is achieved.<br>
The solution of the object is obtained from the features of claim 1, especially from the characterising features, whereby the bearing apparatus controlling the film head is swivellably mounted in a constant position with respect to the product roll arranged in a receiving and driving apparatus, and the swivel axis of the bearing apparatus is located independently of the size of the product roll, on a straight line arranged at right angles to the central axis of the roll in the area of the centre point of the roll.<br>
The advantage of the apparatus according to the invention is that the centre point of the product roll is always located in the same position with respect to the swivel axis of the bearing apparatus regardless of the dimensions of the product roll and thus the product roll can always be measured and packaged very accurately. In this way it is thus possible to adapt the packaging process flexibly to different dimensions of the product roll, whereby the accuracy of the packaging process is increased and the capacity is increased. Using the apparatus according to the invention the product roll can be packaged completely<br>
dust-free and moisture-tight. Finally, as a result of the defined arrangement, the requirements for the control of the bearing apparatus are lower, thereby saving costs.<br>
In a first embodiment the film head has a device by which means a defined spacing can be achieved between the film head and the outer surface of the product roll during the winding process despite the decreasing diameter of the film roll. A defined spacing between the film head and the outer surface of the product roll is especially advantageous for a controllable packaging process. A constant packaging quality can thus be achieved despite different product roll sizes. Such a device can, for example, consist of a laser sensor which determines the distance from the product roll by means of a laser beam and passes this on to a control system which causes the bearing device to stop the film head at the calculated distance from the outer surface of the product roll.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the device for creating a defined spacing is formed from a deflecting roll arranged in front of the film roll which makes available a defined film offtake line (L) during the winding process. In this way it is possible to disregard the reduction in the diameter of the film roll during the unwinding process. The distance between film head and outer surface of the product roll is always measured starting from the deflecting roll since this prepares the take-off line from which the film leaves the film head.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention the film head has a device which guarantees a substantially constant elongation of the plastic stretch film during the winding process.<br>
According to another embodiment the film roll can be arranged on a wind-off apparatus which is provided with a braking device which brings about the substantially<br>
constant elongation of the film web depending on the decreasing diameter of the film roll during the wrapping process. The unwinding resistance which increases with decreasing film roll diameter as a result of the reducing lever arm can be kept constant by such a braking device, wherein the roll is braked less, the smaller the diameter of the film roll.<br>
According to another embodiment, the braking device is constructed as a magnetic powder brake. Such a magnetic powder brake is available on the market as a standard component and allows the braking force to be adjusted accurately.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention provides that the film head has a clamping and cutting device for the film. After separating the film, the film end can be held in a defined position by means of the clamping device and placed precisely onto the product roll again during the following winding process. The cutting device makes any manual cutting of the film superfluous and thus makes the process more economical.<br>
According to another embodiment, the clamping and cutting device is provided with a pressing device for the film end. After the separating process, the film end on the side of the product roll can be simply placed on the product roll, for example, where it adheres as a result of static charging.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention, this pressing device can be constructed as a brush which makes the pressing device cheap and not liable to breakdown.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention provides that in the swivel area of the bearing device of the film head there is arranged a device for providing and applying an adhesive<br>
element at the beginning of the film. By means of such a device the adhesive tape can be applied economically and precisely on to the beginning of the film.<br>
According to another embodiment, at least two receiving and driving devices are arranged in the processing area of the robot arm. In this way, during the wrapping of one film roll, the loading and unloading of another film roll can be accomplished on another receiving and driving device whereby the capacity of the apparatus according to the invention is significantly increased.<br>
The invention further relates to an automatic computer-assisted method for wrapping a cylindrical product roll, rotatable about a bearing axis and provided with two front faces and one outer surface, using a plastic stretch film, wherein the film is arranged on a spatially movable film head.<br>
Such a method is known from US 5 203 139. In this method partial areas of the left and the right front face of the product roll are alternately wrapped until both front faces are completely covered. In this case, during the change between the front faces the already partly packaged outer surface of the product roll is covered with film. Thus, this method is disadvantageous both with respect to economic efficiency and with respect to the precision of the packaging and the capacity. The method also has disadvantages in terms of the flexibility to be able to package products rolls of different dimensions.<br>
Furthermore, such a method is also known from DE 691 06 801. In this method an initial section of the film is first applied to an outer surface of a product. A film head carrying the film roll then moves over the product parallel to the outer surface, wherein the film head was first swivelled through 90° and a film web is applied<br>
continuously in this fashion. The end surface of the product is covered by swivelling the film head about another swivel axis which is orthogonal to the first swivel axis. This method is worthy of improvement both in terms of its flexibility regarding the product dimensions and also the accuracy of the packaging.<br>
On the basis of the aforesaid prior art, it is thus the object of the invention to provide an apparatus with which an improved flexibility of the packaging process as well as a higher capacity and greater flexibility in relation to different product roll dimensions is achieved.<br>
The solution of this object is obtained from the features of claim 11, especially the following process steps:<br>
a)	Measuring the length of the product roll and the<br>
distance of a defined take-off line of the film head<br>
from the outer surface of the product roll;<br>
b)	Applying an adhesive means to the beginning of the<br>
film;<br>
c)	Applying the film to the outer surface of the product<br>
roll;<br>
d)	Driving the product roll at constant speed;<br>
e)	Moving  the  film  head  parallel  to  a  longitudinal<br>
central axis of the product roll at least partly<br>
beyond a first end region;<br>
f)	Swivelling the film head through 90° in the direction<br>
of movement;<br>
g) After covering a partial area of the front face extending as far as the axis, swivelling the film head back;<br>
h) Thereafter repeating process steps f) and g) many times wherein respectively different areas of the front face adjacent to the peripheral area of the bearing sleeve are covered until complete wrapping is achieved;<br>
i) Moving the film head parallel to the longitudinal central axis of the product at least partly beyond a second end region, whereby the outer surface of the product roll is completely wrapped at the same time over its entire area;<br>
j) Carrying out process steps specified under f) , g) and h) ;<br>
k) Swivelling the film head into the starting position and moving the film towards the centre of the product roll;<br>
1)   Braking the product roll until it stops; m)   clamping and separating the film;<br>
n) Moving the film head in the immediate vicinity of the outer surface;<br>
o)   Pressing the film end.<br>
The method according to the invention has the aforesaid advantages with reference to the apparatus.<br>
In another embodiment, after the packaging, the film head is swivelled to another receiving and driving device and<br>
The packaging process is repeated for another product roll during which the already packaged product roll is exchanged for an unpackaged product roll. In this way, during the packaging of one film roll, other film rolls can be placed in or removed from the receiving and driving device, whereby an almost continuous packaging process is possible. The capacity of the apparatus is thus significantly increased and the economic efficiency is improved.<br>
Accordingly, there is provided an apparatus for wrapping at least one cylindrical product roll, rotatably mounted about a bearing axis in a receiving and driving device and provided with two front faces and one outer surface, using a plastic stretch film affixed unrotatably on a spatially movable film head which is arranged on a movable bearing device, wherein the apparatus has automatic computer-assisted position control of the film head, characterized in that the bearing apparatus (11) controlling the film head (12) is swivellably mounted in a constant position with respect to the product roll (13, 14) arranged in a receiving and driving apparatus, and the swivel axis (z) of the bearing apparatus (11) is located independently of the size of the product roll (13, 14) on a straight line arranged at right angles to the central axis (M) of the roll in the area of the centre point (P) of the roll.<br>
Accordingly, there is also provided a method for wrapping a cylindrical product roll, rotatable about a bearing axis and provided with two front faces and one outer surface, using a plastic stretch film, wherein the film is arranged on a spatially movable film head, by means of the following process steps:<br>
a)	Measuring the length of the product roll and the distance of a<br>
defined take-off line of the film head from the outer surface of the product roll;<br>
b)	Applying an adhesive means to the beginning of the film;<br>
c)	Applying the film to the outer surface of the product roll;<br>
d)	Driving the product roll at constant speed;<br>
e)	Moving the film head parallel to the longitudinal central axis of<br>
the product roll at least partly beyond a first end region;<br>
f)	Swivelling the film head through 90° in the direction of movement;<br>

In the drawings an apparatus for wrapping a product roll is designated in its entirety by the reference number 10. In accordance with Fig. 1, such an apparatus 10 substantially consists of a robot arm 11, a film head 12, two devices for receiving and driving product rolls 13 and 14 not shown, an adhesive device 15 shown in Fig. 2 and a robot control system not shown.<br>
The robot arm 11 has a foot 16, as shown in Fig. 1, for fixing permanently to the ground, wherein, for example, it is also possible to fix said foot 16 to a ceiling or a wall. A swivel axis z of the robot arm 11 is located on a straight line y running at right angles to the central axis M of the product rolls 13, 14 through a centre point P of the product rolls 13, 14. Regardless of the dimensions of the product rolls 13, 14, the centre point P is always located in the same position with respect to the swivelaxis z of the robot arm 11. In this way, the dimensions of the product rolls 13, 14 can be determined very accurately and the packaging can then be carried out precisely. As a result of this defined arrangement, cheaper control systems can be used for the robot arm 11 because of the lower requirements.<br>
The robot arm 11 has elements lla, lib, lie and lid which are interconnected such that they can swivel by means of joints 17, 18, 19. By means of these three joints 17, 18, 19 together with two other joints 20 and 21, the film head 12 can be moved very accurately into any position within the working area of the robot arm 11.<br>
As shown in Figs. la to Ic, the film head 12 can be swivelled between the two film rolls 13 and 14 by means of the robot arm 11. During the packaging of a product roll 13, it is possible, as shown in Fig. la, to exchange another already packaged product roll 14 for an unpackaged one, whereby the capacity of the apparatus 10 is increased.<br>
The film head 12 is shown in detail in Figs. 3a, b. Said film head essentially has two conical pins 22 with magnetic powder brakes (not shown) for holding and carrying along with it a core of the film roll 24 not shown, a deflecting roll 25, two clamping claws 26a and 26b, a cutting device 27, a brush 28 and a distance sensor 29 (see also Fig. 5b).<br>
The distance sensor 29 is located in a fixed position with respect to the deflecting roll 25 which provides a defined take-up line L (see Fig. 3b) for the film web 37. The distance sensor 29 determines the distance from the product roll 13 and passes this data on to the machine control system of the robot arm 11, and the desired position of the deflecting roll 25 can be calculated from this. In this way, it is possible to maintain a defined distance between the deflecting roll 25 and the outer surface 32 of the<br>
product roll 13 according to the dimensions of the product rolls 13, 14 and thus a defined free length of film web 37.<br>
The product rolls 13, 14 are suspended in the receiving and driving device by end regions 30 and 31 of a bearing sleeve being gripped by expanding pins which engage in the bearing sleeve and expand there so that during rotation of the expanding pin, the bearing sleeve is set in rotation together with the product rolls 13, 14.<br>
The packaging process is now carried out as follows:<br>
The film head 12 is first swivelled to the adhesive tape dispenser 15, as shown in Fig. 2a. There, as can be seen from Figs. 2b and 3a, b, a strip of double-sided adhesive tape 36 is applied with its longitudinal side to the film web 37. In this case, during the adhesion process the deflecting roll 25 serves as a thrust bearing for the film web 37. During this time the film web 37 is held under tension by the closed clamping claws (26a, b) (see Fig. 3a, b) .<br>
As shown in Fig. 4a and 4b, the film head 12 is then moved centrally, always parallel to the line y, onto the product roll 13 at a certain distance. The diameter of the product roll 13 and thus the size of the front faces 33, 34 of the product roll 13 can be determined from the data supplied by the distance sensor 29.<br>
In order to measure the product roll 13, in a next step the film head 13 moves parallel to the central axis M over the front face 34 of the product roll 13 into a defined end position and then approaches the front face 34 again until the position of the front face 34 is found (see Fig. 5a, b). The film head also travels in the same way to measure the positions of the right front face 33, as can be seen from Fig. 6a, b.<br>
The film head 12 then moves centrally back in front of the product roll 13 and then approaches an outer surface 32, as shown in Figs. 7 a and 7b. An initial region 23 of the film web 37, approximately 650 mm wide and provided with the adhesive tape strip 36, is adhered to the outer surface 32, by the deflecting roll 25 pressing the film web 37 provided with the adhesive tape strip 37 onto the outer surface 32 of the product roll 13. The product roll 13 is then set in rotation, as shown in Fig. 8a, b, whereby the film web 37 is wound around the product roll 13.<br>
For a defined packaging process it is necessary to hold the film web 37 under uniform tension. As the diameter of the film roll 24 decreases, the unwinding resistance increases as a result of the decreasing lever arm. For this reason the conical pins 22 which co-rotate with the film roll 24 are provided with magnetic powder brakes not shown which brake less, the smaller the diameter of the film roll 24 and thus ensure a uniform tension of the film web 37.<br>
In order that the packaging process can be completely controlled under defined conditions, the deflecting roll 25 of the film head 12 occupies a fixed distance A from the outer surface 32 of the product roll 13 during packaging, as shown in Fig. 9a, b. The film head 12 moves towards the front face 33 at the distance A whereby the outer surface 32 of the product roll 13 is wrapped with the film web 37. In this case, the film head 12 is controlled such that the film web 37 wraps around the outer surface 32 of the product roll 13 overlapping at the edge regions in a helical fashion. The film head 12 now moves so far over the front face 33 of the product roll 13 that the film web 37 projects partly over the front face 33, as shown in Fig. lOb.<br>
The film head 12 then swivels in the direction of movement through 90° and moves into an optimum position for wrapping the front face 33, wherein the film head 12 can also be swivelled closer to the front face 33 by means of the joint 19. As shown in Fig. lla, a partial area of the front face 33 is then covered with the film web 37, wherein the film web 37 is passed so closely to a peripheral area 35 of the bearing sleeve area 30 that no uncovered areas are formed. After packaging the partial area of the front face 33, the film head 12 swivels back through 90° so that the outer surface 38 is again covered with the film web 37 as shown in Fig. 10.<br>
Then, depending on the size of the product roll 13, the film head 12 is automatically swivelled through 90° many times at certain time intervals between the positions shown in Fig. 10 and Fig. 11 so that, as described previously and shown in Fig. 12, other partial areas of the front face 33 are provided with the film web 37 until the entire front face 33 is tightly packaged, wherein the film web 37 abuts against the peripheral area 35 of the end 30 of the bearing sleeve 30 in a collar fashion. The swivelling of the film head 12 takes place automatically at time intervals calculated by the control system of the robot arm 11 which are coordinated with the product dimensions and the constant rotational speed of the product roll 13.<br>
After completely packaging the front face 33, the film head swivels back into the position for wrapping the outer surface 32 and moves towards the front face 34 at the distance A (see Figs. 13a, b). The packaging processes for the front face 33 are now carried out similarly, as shown in Figs. 14 and 15, in order to also wrap the front face 34. The film head 12 is then moved centrally in front of the product roll 13, covering the outer surface 32 (see Fig. 16) . The front faces 33 and 34 as well as the entire<br>
outer surface 32 of the product roll are now covered with the film web 37.<br>
After packaging has been completed, the rotation of the product roll 13 is stopped and the film head 12 is swivelled about the joint 19 to separate the film web 37, as shown in Fig. 18. The film web 37 thereby moves into the range of action of the clamping claws 26 of the cutting device 27 and the brush 28. The film web 37 is held under tension by closing the clamping claws 26, the film head 12 is moved towards the outer surface 32 of the product roll 13 and then separates the film web 37 by means of the cutting device 27 (see Fig. 19) . The film web 37 is then brushed onto the surface 32 using the brush 28 while swivelling the film head 12. The film web 37 adheres to the outer surface 32 of the product roll 13 by static charge.<br>
The winding process of the product roll 13 is now terminated, the film head 12 moves away form the surface 32 of the product roll 13 and is swivelled through 180° to the product roll 14 by the robot arm 11 (see Fig. Ic). Another winding process can now begin there without any waiting time while the product roll 13 is removed from the device and an unpackaged product roll can be inserted in the receiving and driving device.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
