				<td>Technical   Field<br>
The  present  invention relates  to an  ink jet print head identification  circuit and method.      More  particularly,   it  relates to an  ink  jet  print head  identification  circuit that  employs shift  registers   for   serially transmitting a print  head identification  code   to  an   ink  jet  printer  controller.<br>
Background<br>
Ink   jet   type  printers   employ  a  printing head  that  consists of  a  series   of  nozzles,   or  orifices  positioned  in  an  orifice plate  for  expelling   ink. onto  a printing   surface.     The   ink  can  be expelled  by   a   variety   of  means,   including  continuous, piezoelectric,   and  thermal/bubble   jet.      While  several   different ink   jet   technologies   have  evolved   over   the  past  two  decades,   the most  popular   ink  jet   technology  today   is   the  bubble   jet where   ink within  a  chamber  is   locally  superheated  to  form an  expanding bubble  which   propels   a  drop of   ink  through  an  orifice  and  onto the  printing   surface..   Piezoelectric printers -function   in  a similar manner   inasmuch  as   ink  is   expelled through  an  orifice. However,   instead  of   boiling  the   ink~in   a   chamber,   the   ink   is essentially   squeezed   from the  chamber as  a result of deflections/expansions   generated   by  a  piezoelectric   ceramic transducer.      The  ceramic  transducer  changes   its  physical dimensions   when   subjected to  an  electric   field,   thereby generating   ei   pressure   wave within  the   ink  chamber  and   expelling an  amount   of   ink  through  the  chamber  orifice.      Both  piezoelectric and   bubble-jet   methodologies  are   considered  "drop-on-demand11   or "impulse"   technologies,    i.e.,   a  drop  of   ink  is  ejected   from  the print  head   only   when   desired.<br>
Each   type   of   ink   jet print  technology  requires   its   own unique  type   cf   print  head,   and  print  heads may  further  vary   based or-,   parameters   such  as   whether  the  print  head contains   only  black ink,   or   whether   it   is   capable   of   color   printing.      Generally,   the different   types   of   print  heads   are   interchangeable,   except   that most   printers   are   unable   to  accommodate   both  black   ink   and   color due   to   physical   differences   between   the   print  heads,    i.e.,   print<br>
heads designed for color printing are typically larger to accommodate a variety of ink colors.  Other print head parameters include architecture, resolution, number of ink jet nozzles, and spacing between the nozzles.  Because print heads are interchangeable, the printer electronics must know what particular type of print head is installed, as well as information relating to the various print head parameters, so that algorithms within the printer control system can be reconfigured to provide appropriately formatted print commands to the print head electronics.<br>
Therefore, it is desirable to provide the printer electronics with information relating to the characteristics of the particular print head that is installed.  This can be done by digitally encoding the identifying information into the print head electronics and enabling the printer electronics to retrieve that information as it is needed.<br>
A number of attempts have been made in the prior art to provide print head identifying information to the printer electronics.   U.S. Patent No. 4,872,027 to Buskirk et al. discloses providing extra electrical contact pads on the resistor network/array which fires the nozzles of the print head.  These contact pads are selectively electrically connected in the resistor network to fire the individual nozzles in one of several unique configurations, each of which defines a specific print head.  The code provided by these unique configurations of the electrical pads is detectable by the printer so that the type of head installed is determinable.  This is accomplished by selectively connecting the individual electrical pads (or not connecting them) to the resistor circuits or circuit traces.  By individually toggling the resistor lines at high or low voltage levels and detecting a voltage level shift on the lines associated with the extra contact pads, a connection (or lack thereof) may be detected.<br>
Other prior art approaches to providing print head identifying information to the printer disclose identification circuitry disposed in the print head.  U.S. Patent No. 4,930,915 to Kikuchi et al. discloses print head identification means disposed in a print head.  In one embodiment, a 24-pin print head is identified when the printer electronics read a "high" state<br>
value on a signal line interconnecting the printer electronics and identification means.  A 9-pin print head is identified by a "low" state signal.  In another embodiment of the Kikuchi invention, a parallel-serial converter produces a predetermined identification signal.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,363,134 to Barbehenn et al. discloses an integrated circuit for use in the print head of an ink jet printer.  The integrated circuit includes an array circuit having a plurality of resistor cells arranged into rows and columns for heating an ink reservoir to produce a pattern of ink jets.  A corresponding number of row and column lines are coupled to the array circuit for selecting and energizing the resistor cells according to the desired print pattern.  An identification circuit is integrated into the same substrate as the array circuit.  The identification circuit is programmable by means of a plurality of programmable paths corresponding and coupled to each row line.  These programmable paths each include a programmable fuse and an active device connected in series.  The opposite ends of the programmable paths are coupled together at a common node, which in turn is coupled to an output circuit for providing a single serial output signal in response to a sequential polling of the row lines.<br>
The number of bits of identifying information that Barbehenn is capable of providing to the printer electronics is limited to the number of row lines available.  For example, if there are a total of seven row lines interconnecting the array circuit w.ith the printer electronics, then Barbehenn's identification circuit will be limited to storing seven and only seven bits of identifying information because each of the programmable paths correspond with and are coupled to a unique one of the row lines. To provide an identification circuit that contains greater than seven bits of identifying information, Barbehenn would be required to increase the number of row lines, or address lines available.<br>
Thus, there is a need for an efficient, inexpensive, print head identification circuit that preferably is not limited by the number of address lines interconnecting the existing print head electronics and printer electronics.<br>
Summary<br>
The present invention discloses an identification system for providing ink jet print head identifying information in ink jet printers having ink jet print heads.  The system includes a controller and drive circuit for transmitting signals including at least one clock signal in the form of clock pulses.  The controller and drive circuit also receive signals.  A plurality of address lines are provided for transmitting signals, including the at least one clock signal, from the controller and drive circuit to the ink jet print head.  An identification circuit disposed in the ink jet print head contains a digital code corresponding to the print head identifying information.  The identification circuit is connected to receive the at least one clock signal from the address lines and is responsive to the at least one clock signal to serially transmit the digital code.  An output line is connected to the identification circuit for transmitting the bits of the digital code to the controller.  The controller is connected to receive the bits of the digital code from the output line, and programmed to interpret the digital code and determine the print head identifying information.<br>
The identification system may further include a temperature sense circuit connected to the output line for transmitting information corresponding to the temperature of the print head.<br>
An example of the identification circuit includes a predetermined number of shift registers.  Each of these shift registers is programmed in accordance with the digital code to produce an output of either a logic one or a logic zero in response to the at least one clock signal.<br>
The controller and drive circuit may be configured to transmit at least one load signal on the address lines.  When so configured, the identification circuit includes a predetermined number of shift registers where each shift register is programmed in accordance with the digital code to produce an output of either a logical one or a logical zero in response to the at least one load signal and the at least one clock signal.  The controller is programmed to transmit the load signal and, following the load signal transmission, to interpret a next predetermined number of bits on the output line as the digital code.<br>
The controller and drive circuit may also be configured to transmit at least one load signal and first and second clock signals on the address lines.  In such a case, the identification circuit includes a load circuit and a transmit circuit.  The load circuit is connected to receive the load signal from the address lines, and is responsive to the load signal to load the digital code into the transmit circuit as the loaded digital code.  The transmit circuit is responsive to the loaded digital code and the first and second clock signals to serially transmit the digital code on the output line.  The controller is programmed to transmit the load signal and, following the load signal transmission, to interpret a next predetermined number of bits on the output line as the digital code.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, an ink jet print head identification circuit is integrated into an ink jet print head chip having print head electronics, a plurality of address lines, and a print head temperature sense circuit with an output.  The identification circuit provides print head identifying information to an ink jet printer and includes an output device and a plurality of programmed one bit shift registers.  The shift registers are interconnected to the address lines and the output device for serially shifting the programmed contents of the registers to the output device in response to signals received on the address lines.<br>
The signals may, for example, include at least one clock signal and a load signal.  In this example, the registers are interconnected to each other to serially shift their programmed contents to the output device in response to the at least one clock signal and the load signal.<br>
As an example of the output device, there is an output transistor having a source, drain, and gate.  The gate of the output transistor receives the serially shifted, programmed contents of the shift registers.  A pull up device pulls up the signal level on the drain of the output transistor.  The programmed contents of the shift registers are received by the output transistor.  A discharge device discharges parasitic capacitance at the gate of the output transistor following reception of the programmed contents.<br>
Another preferred embodiment of the present invention is disclosed where an ink jet print head integrated circuit provides print head identifying information to ink jet printer electronics.

The identification circuit also provides print head identifying information to the temperature sense circuit output in serial digital format in response to the first and second clock signals and the load signal.<br>
An example of the identification circuit for this embodiment includes a load circuit and a transmit circuit.  The load circuit is connected to receive the load signal from the address lines and is responsive to the load signal to load the identifying information into the transmit circuit.  The transmit circuit is responsive to the loaded identifying information and the first and second clock signals to serially transmit the loaded identifying information on the temperature sense circuit output.<br>
The present invention also discloses a method for providing ink jet print head identifying information to an ink jet printer having printer electronics and an ink jet print head.  The print head includes an integrated circuit having print head array electronics, a temperature sense circuit with an output connected to the printer electronics, an identification circuit, an output device connected to the temperature sense circuit output, and a plurality of address lines interconnecting the identification circuit and printer electronics.  The method includes the steps of programming a digital code having one or more bits into the identification circuit.  Each bit of the code is programmed as either an electrically conducting short or a non-conducting gap, where the digital code corresponds to the print head identifying information.  Signals generated by the printer electronics, including at least one clock signal in the form of clock pulses,<br>
are transmitted on the address lines to the identification circuit.  One or more bits of the digital code are transmitted to the output device in serial digital format in response to the signals generated by the printer electronics.  The digital code is read by the printer electronics as it is transmitted to the output device.<br>
The method may further include the step of determining the identifying information from the transmitted digital code by the printer electronics based in part on the condition of each bit as either a gap or a short.<br>
The method may also include the step of transmitting a load signal, as a printer electronics signal, to the identification circuit via the address lines.<br>
As another additional step in the method, the output device may be reset following transmission of the digital code to the output device.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, there is shown in FIG. 1 a block diagram of an ink jet print head identification system 20 including ink jet printer electronics 22 and ink jet print head electronics 24.  Typically, bubble jet print heads incorporate a resistor array, or print head array 30 for selectively boiling and expelling ink through orifices in an orifice plate (not shown) on the print head. Resistors within the array 30 are selectively energized through<br>
appropriate signals received from the printer electronics 22 on address lines 29.  Within the printer electronics 22 a microprocessor controller 26, which is typically an ASIC controller providing TTL level outputs, sends print data commands to a head drive circuit 28.  In a preferred embodiment, the drive circuit 28 is a TEXAS INSTRUMENTS 75373, 100 milliamp, push-pull driver.<br>
Drive circuit 28 converts print data commands received from the controller 26 into appropriately formatted analog pulses which are demultiplexed and sequentially provided to the print head electronics 24 via address lines 29.  These analog pulses possess sufficient intensity to heat the resistors within the print head array 30 so that ink within the print head boils to form a bubble, thereby expelling ink through an orifice.  The number of address lines 29 available will vary depending on the particular printer that is used.<br>
Because different styles and types of ink jet print heads requiring differently formatted analog pulses are interchangeable in ink jet printers, it is important for the printer electronics 22 to possess information relating to the print head that is installed in the printer.  Print head parametric information is useful to the printer electronics 22 because it allows the printer electronics 22 to reconfigure print control algorithms to produce analog pulses that are appropriate for the specific print head installed.  The present invention provides print head identifying information to the printer electronics 22 by encoding the information digitally in an identification (ID) circuit 32 that is integrated into the print head electronics 24 during fabrication.<br>
Typically, print head electronics 24 are fabricated as a single integrated chip.  In addition to the print head resistor array 30 and corresponding address line connections 29, the chip will normally incorporate a temperature sense circuit 34.  The temperature sense circuit 34 is typically a metal resistor that senses the temperature of the print head during printing.  The sensed temperature is provided as an analog signal to the printer controller 26 on output line 35, enabling the printer controller 26 to monitor the print head for overheat conditions.<br>
To reduce I/O requirements, the ID circuit 32 of the present invention uses some, but not all, of the existing address lines 29 for receiving inputs from the printer electronics 22 and it uses the existing temperature sense output 35 to serially transmit the encoded print head identifying information to the printer electronics 22.  A maximum of three address lines are used by the ID circuit 32 to receive inputs, and the number of encoded bits of information within the ID circuit 32 is independent of the number of address lines 29 used.  There is minimal or no interference with the temperature sense output 35 during normal operation because the printer electronics 22 will read temperature sense only when the printer is idle.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, print head identifying information is digitally encoded into the ID circuit 32 by means of one or more programmed, one bit dynamic shift registers 50 such as the one shown in FIG. 2.  The shift register 50 is, for example, mask programmed during fabrication by either connecting the source of load transistor 52 to ground 51 to produce a logic "0" when the gate of load transistor 52 is made active by a load signal 70 received on one of the address lines 29, or by connecting the source of load transistor 52 to a voltage source 53 to produce a logic "1" when the gate of load transistor 52 is active.  When the gate of load transistor 52 becomes active by load signal 70, the programmed logic, or voltage level is passed to the gate of input transistor 54.  After transistor 52 turns off, the passed voltage level will remain stored in the parasitic gate capacitance of input transistor 54.  Because the voltage at the gate of input transistor 54 will eventually discharge due to leakage currents, the voltage is considered dynamically stored on the gate.<br>
With the input 78 loaded with the programmed voltage level, it can now be shifted to the output 76.  This is accomplished by sequential clock signals transmitted by the printer electronics 22 and received by the shift register 50.  A clock 1 input is received on line 72 and a clock 2 input is received on line 74, where each clock input 72, 74 is received from the printer electronics 22 via a separate address line 29.  A voltage pulse on the clock 1 input 72 passes the logical inverse from the gate of input transistor 54 to the gate of output transistor 60.  When<br>
the clock 1 input 72 is active, load transistor 56 turns on as does pass transistor 58.  If the input 78 of the shift register 50 is a logic "1", input transistor 54 will turn on and the gate of output transistor 60 will discharge.  If the input 78 of the shift register 50 is a logic "0", input transistor 54 will remain off and the gate of output transistor 60 will be charged through load transistor 56 and pass transistor 58.  When the voltage pulse on the clock 1 input 72 goes inactive, pass transistor 58 turns off and the voltage level (i.e., the logic inverse of the voltage level that was parasitically stored on the gate of input transistor 54) will be dynamically stored on the gate of output transistor 60.<br>
A voltage pulse on the clock 2 input 74 passes the logic inverse from the gate of output transistor 60 to the output 76 of the shift register. When the clock 2 pulse is active, load transistor 62 turns on as does pass transistor 64.  The logic inverse of the gate voltage on output transistor 60 passes to the output 76 of the shift register.  Therefore, after successive pulses on the clock 1 and 2 inputs 72, 74, the logic level on input 78 is passed to the output 76 as a single bit.<br>
It should be noted that, because the load transistors 52, 56, 62 are off at all times except during clock pulses, the register 50 of FIG. 2 consumes little power.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, several shift registers 50 are connected in series to provide a digital code, such as the four bit example shown in FIG. 3. A voltage pulse on load signal 70 initiates a parallel load of the encoded logic level, or bit encoded within each of the four shift registers 50A-D.  As previously discussed, this results in the programmed logic level being dynamically stored at the input 78 (FIG. 2} of each shift register 50A-D. A pulse on the clock 1 input 72 followed by a pulse on the clock 2 input 74 shifts the logic level from each register input 78 to each register output 76 so that each register output 76 is dynamically stored on the input 78 of the next register.<br>
With each clock 1 and clock 2 sequence of pulses, each programmed bit is successively and serially shifted to an output device 80 and read by the controller 26 until all bits have been read by the controller 26.  The controller 26 is programmed to<br>
interpret the code and determine the print head identifying information and reconfigure print control algorithms accordingly. In this manner, a single ink jet printer is able to accommodate many different type of print heads.<br>
As shown in FIG. 3, the output device 80 preferably includes an open drain output transistor 84 and a discharge transistor 82. The voltage level at the drain of output transistor 84 is pulled up on line 86 through a load device (not shown) within the printer electronics 22 (FIG. 1) so that the printer controller 26 reads a programmed logic level after each clock 2 pulse.  For example, when a clock 2 pulse causes a programmed logic level "1" to be transmitted to the gate of output transistor 84, output transistor 84 will become active and the drain will be pulled down.  The controller 26 detects the lowered voltage level at the drain by reading the voltage level at line 86 and thereby senses that a logic level "1" has been transmitted by the ID circuit 32. Similarly, with each successive clock 2 pulse the programmed logic levels of the shift registers 50A-D are sequentially shifted and serially transmitted to output transistor 84 to be read by the controller 26.  FIG. 4 is a timing chart for serial transmission of four bits of encoded information by the ID circuit 32 of FIG. 3.<br>
With continued reference to FIG. 3, the open drain output 86 preferably utilizes an existing chip I/O line to serially transmit the encoded identifying information to the printer controller 26, such as the temperature sense output 35. Utilization of the existing temperature sense output 35, along with the fact that the encoded information is serially transmitted, eliminates the need for additional chip output lines.  After all bits of the encoded information have been read, a pulse on the load signal line 70 activates discharge transistor 82 to discharge the gate of output transistor 84, thereby enabling valid temperature sense information to be transmitted to the controller 26 immediately after the gate of output transistor 84 has been discharged.  To prevent possible interference with normal operation of the temperature sense circuit 34, a pulse is output by the controller 26 on the load signal line 70 prior to each read of the temperature sense circuit 34.  This ensures that<br>
the gate of output transistor 84 remains discharged during temperature control operations.<br>
The controller 26 reads the serial digital output on line 86 and determines print head identifying information by comparing the received bit pattern against stored correlations of print head information.  With the print head properly identified by the printer controller 26, the controller 26 is now able to reconfigure its control system algorithms to accommodate printing with the installed print head.<br>
It will be understood that any number of shift registers 50 may be employed in the present invention without increasing the required number of address lines 29.  Therefore, there is disclosed an ink jet print head identification circuit 32 for serially transmitting to the printer controller 26 a digital code containing print head identifying information where the number of bits comprising the digital code is independent of the total number of address lines 29 available.<br>
It is contemplated, and will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the foregoing specification and drawings that modifications and/or changes may be made in the embodiments of the invention.
