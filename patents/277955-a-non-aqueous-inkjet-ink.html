Description<br>
STABLE NON-AQUEOUS INKJET INKS Technical field<br>
[0001]   The present invention relates to non-aqueous inkjet Inks improved for<br>
dispersion stability and suitable for manufacturing decorative laminates by single pass inkjet printing.<br>
Background art<br>
[0002]   Pigment dispersions are usually made using a dispersant. A dispersant is a substance for promoting the formation and stabilization of a dispersion of pigment particles in a dispersion medium. Dispersants are generally surface-active materials having an anionic, cationic or non-ionic structure. The presence of a dispersant substantially reduces the dispersing energy required. Dispersed pigment particles may have a tendency to re-agglomerate after the dispersing operation, due to mutual attraction forces. The use of dispersants also counteracts this re-agglomeration tendency of the pigment particles.<br>
[0003]  The dispersant has to meet particularly high requirements when used for inkjet inks. Inadequate dispersing manifests itself as increased viscosity in liquid systems, loss of brilliance and/or hue shifts. Moreover, particularly good dispersion of the pigment particles is required to ensure unimpeded passage of the pigment particles through the nozzles of the print head, which are usually 10 to 50 micrometers in diameter. In addition, pigment particle agglomeration and the associated blockage of the printer nozzles has to be avoided in the standby periods of the printer.<br>
[0004]  Polymeric dispersants generally contain in one part of the molecule<br>
so-called anchor groups, which adsorb onto the pigments to be dispersed, and in a spatially separate part of the molecule, the polymehc dispersants have polymer chains compatible with the dispersion medium, thus stabilizing the pigment particles In the dispersion medium. Typical polymeric dispersants include graft copolymer and block copolymer dispersants.<br>
[0005]   In aqueous inkjet inks, the polymeric dispersants generally contain hydrophobic anchor groups exhibiting a high affinity for the pigment<br>
 <br>
surface and hydrophiiic polymer chains for stabilizing the pigments in the aqueous dispersion medium.<br>
[0006]  The preparation of good thermally stable dispersions with submicron<br>
particles is much more difficult for non-aqueous Inkjet inks, such as solvent based, oil based and radiation curable inkjet inks. The pigments are especially difficult to disperse when they have a non-polar surface.<br>
[0007]   These dispersing problems have lead to the design of very specific<br>
polymeric dispersants wherein the anchor groups are pigment derivatives. For example, EP 0763378 A (TOYO INK) discloses a pigment composition comprising a non-aqueous type pigment dispersing agent having a portion which has a high affinity with a pigment and which has at least one type selected from the group consisting of an organic dye, anthraquinone and acridone only at a terminal end or at both terminal ends of at least one polymer selected from a linear urethane polymer and a linear acrylic polymer, and a pigment.<br>
[0008]   Another approach for dispersing pigments with non-polar surfaces in non¬aqueous dispersion media is changing the surface to a more polar surface by addition of compounds known as dispersion synergists. A dispersion synergist is a compound that promotes the adsorption of the polymeric dispersant on the surface of the pigment. It is suggested that the synergist should possess the pigment structure substituted by one or more sulfonic acid groups or ammonium salts thereof.<br>
[0009]   US 4461647 (ICl) discloses a dispersion of a pigment in an organic liquid containing a water-insoluble asymmetric disazo compound comprising a central divalent group free from acidic and other ionic substituents linked through azo groups to two monovalent end groups characterized in that one end group, the first, is free from acidic and other ionic substituents and the other end group, the second, carries a single substituted ammonium-acid salt group.<br>
[0010]  Although these dispersion synergists work fine for some pigments, many other pigments can not be dispersed to an acceptable quality in a non¬aqueous medium. This is, for example, the case for diketopyn-olo-pyrrole<br>
 <br>
pigments, for which it is difficult to obtain stable non-aqueous pigment dispersions, especially stable non-aqueous ink-jet inks.<br>
[0011]    US 20040122130 (CHANG ET AL.) discloses a photo-curable pigment type Inkjet ink composition containing Pigment Red 254 but the ink requires the presence of water and a reactive surfactant.<br>
[0012]   The dispersion quality and stability can also be influenced by the<br>
composition of tiie dispersion medium, however this also influences the behaviour of Inkjet droplets jetted upon the ink-receiver surface.<br>
[0013]   Many types of solvents and specific combinations of solvents have been disclosed. £P 1528086 A (SEIKO EPSON) discloses an oil-based Inkjet Ink comprising at least 50% of a mixed solvent of a lactone-type solvent and a polyoxyethyleneglycol dialkyi ether. It was found by the present inventor that further improvements in dispersion stability and jetting characteristics, such as latency, were required particularly for single pass Inkjet printing. For certain Inkjet applications, it would also be desirable to make inks lacking a noxious solvent such as lactone.<br>
[0014]   For consistent image quality, Inkjet Inks require high dispersion stability<br>
capable of dealing with high temperatures (above 65°C) during transport of the ink to a customer, jetting at elevated temperatures and changes in the dispersion medium of the inkjet ink during use. Theses changes in the dispersion medium can occur, for example, by evaporation of solvent and increasing concentrations of humectants, penetrants and other additives at the nozzles during the summer or when the printer is not jetting for a long time (= latency) and the Inkjet print-heads are filled with ink, e.g. over the weekend.<br>
Disclosure of the invention<br>
Technical problem<br>
[0015]   Inkjet printing provides large flexibility in the production of decorative laminates, but high printing speed is required to obtain acceptable productivity. This is possible with single pass Inkjet printing if the inkjet printing process is so reliable that during a print Job no maintenance is required. Inkjet Inks having very high dispersion quality and stability and exhibiting minimal latency problems are therefore required. Aqueous inkjet<br>
 <br>
inks generally exhibit latency problems due to the relative high volatility of water. Diketopyrrolo-pyrrole pigments have been a preferred choice in non-inkjet printing Inks, such as e.g. gravure inks, to print images on a decorative paper used In the manufacturing process of decorative laminates for imitating a wooden floor. These pigments have been dispersed to acceptable dispersion quality and stability in aqueous Inkjet inks but not in non-aqueous Inkjet inks.<br>
[0016]  It is an object of the present invention to be able to manufacture Inkjet inks exhibiting high dispersion quality and stability while exhibiting minimal latency problems.<br>
[0017]   It is another object of the present Invention to provide an Inkjet ink set for producing decorative laminates with a warm wooden colour appearance.<br>
[0018]  Further objects of the invention will become apparent from the description hereinafter.<br>
Technical solution<br>
[0019]  Surprisingly it has been found that a reliable non-aqueous single pass<br>
Inkjet printing step could be integrated into the manufacturing process of decorative laminates capable of delivering decorative laminates with a warm wooden colour when non-aqueous pigmented inkjet inks comprising a specific mixture of polyalkyleneglycol dialkylethers were used.<br>
[0020]   Objects of the present invention have been realized with a non-aqueous inkjet ink comprising a pigment and a mixture of at least two polyalkyleneglycol dialkylethers represented by Formula (i):<br>

of the print heads was required. [0023]  [f was found that not only the diketopyrrolo-pyrrole pigments couid be<br>
dispersed to an excellent quality and stability, but also a wide range of<br>
other pigments could be dispersed in non-aqueous inkjet inks exhibiting<br>
high dispersion quality and stability. [0024]  The non-aqueous inkjet inks did not require the presence of a surfactant<br>

and<br>
b) diluting the pigment dispersion of step a) with a non-aqueous solvent to<br>
obtain a pigment concentration between 0.1 and 20 wt% based upon the<br>
total weight of the Inkjet ink.<br>
[0041]  The mixture of polyalkyleneglycol diaikyiethers is preferably present in the non-aqueous inkjet ink in a concentration of between 4 wt% and 98 wt%, more preferably between 15 wt% and 95 wt% and most preferably between 25 vrt% and 90 wt% all based upon the total weight of the non¬aqueous inkjet ink.<br>
[0042]  The non-aqueous inkjet ink according to the present invention may further contain at least one surfactant.<br>
[0043]  The non-aqueous inkjet ink according to the present invention may contain at least one humectant to prevent the clogging of the nozzle, due to its ability to slow down the evaporation rate of ink.<br>
[0044]  The non-aqueous inkjet ink according to the present invention is preferably an organic solvent based but may also be a curable pigmented inkjet ink. The curable pigmented inkjet ink is preferably radiation curable. The viscosity of the pigmented inkjet ink is preferably lower than 100 mPa.s at 30°C. The viscosity of the pigmented inkjet ink is preferably lower than 30 mPa.s, more preferably lower than 15 mPa.s, and most preferably<br>
 <br>
between 2 and 10 mPa.s all measured at a shear rate of 100 s-' and a jetting temperature between 10 and /O^C.<br>
[0045]  The curable pigmented Inkjet ink may contain as dispersion medium<br>
monomers, oligomers and/or prepolymers possessing different degrees of functionality. A mixture including combinations of mono-, di-, tri- and/or higher functionality monomers, oligomers or prepolymers may be used. A catalyst called an initiator for initiating the polymerization reaction may be included in the curable pigmented Inkjet ink. The initiator can be a thermal initiator, but is preferably a photo-initiator. The photo-initiator requires less energy to activate than the monomers, oligomers and/or prepolymers to form the polymer. The photo-initiator suitable for use in the curable pigment dispersion may be a Norrish type I initiator, a Norrish type II initiator or a photo-acid generator.<br>
[0046]   For producing colour images, the non-aqueous Inkjet inks are used in a Inkjet ink set. Preferably the Inkjet ink set comprises at least two non¬aqueous Inkjet inks according to present Invention. In a preferred embodiment the Inkjet ink set comprises at least a cyan ink, a magenta ink, a yellow ink and a black ink. The CMYK ink set may also be extended with extra inks such as red, green, blue, and/or orange to enlarge the colour gamut of the image. The CMYK ink set may also be extended by the combination of full density and light density inks of both color inks and/or black inks to improve the image quality by lowered graininess.<br>
[0047]   In a preferred embodiment the Inkjet ink set comprises a non-aqueous inkjet ink having C.I. Pigment Red 254 as a pigment.<br>
Preparation of pigment dispersions<br>
[0048]  The non-aqueous inkjet ink according to the present invention may be<br>
prepared by milling the pigment in the dispersion medium, preferably in the presence of a polymeric dispersant.<br>
[0049]   Mixing apparatuses may include a pressure kneader, an open kneader, a planetary mixer, a dissolver, and a Datton Universal Mixer. Suitable milling and dispersion apparatuses are a ball mill, a pearl mill, a colloid mill, a high-speed disperser, double rollers, a bead mill, a paint conditioner, and<br>
 <br>
triple rollers. The dispersions may also be prepared using ultrasonic energy.<br>
[0050]   Many different types of materials may be used as milling media, such as glasses, ceramics, metals, and plastics. In a preferred embodiment, the grinding media can comprise particles, preferably substantially spherical in shape, e.g. beads consisting essentially of a polymeric resin or yttrium stabilized zirconium oxide beads.<br>
[0051]   In the process of mixing, milling and dispersion, each process is performed with cooling to prevent build up of heat, and for radiation curable Inkjet inks as much as possible under light conditions in which actinic radiation has been substantially excluded.<br>
[0052]  The non-aqueous Inkjet ink according to the present invention may contain more than one pigment, the non-aqueous Inkjet ink may be prepared using separate dispersions for each pigment, or alternatively several pigments may be mixed and co-milled in preparing the dispersion.<br>
[0053}  The dispersion process can be carried out in a continuous, batch or semi-batch mode.<br>
[0054]  The preferred amounts and ratios of the ingredients of the mill grind will vary widely depending upon the specific materials and the Intended applications. The contents of the milling mixture comprise the mill grind and the milling media. The mill grind comprises pigment, polymeric dispersant and a liquid carrier. For Inkjet inks, the pigment is usually present in the mill grind at 1 to 50 wt%, excluding the milling media. The weight ratio of pigment over polymeric dispersant is 20:1 to 1:2.<br>
[0055]  The milling time can vary widely and depends upon the pigment, the selected mechanical means and residence conditions, the initial and desired final particle size, etc. In the present invention pigment dispersions with an average particle size of less than 150 nm may be prepared.<br>
[0056]  After milling is completed, the milling media is separated from the milled particulate product (in either a dry or liquid dispersion form) using conventional separation techniques, such as by filtration, sieving through a mesh screen, and the like. Often the sieve is built into the mill, e.g. for a<br>
 <br>
bead mill. The milled pigment concentrate is preferably separated from the milling media by filtration.<br>
[0057]   fn general it is desirable to make the inkjet inks in the form of a<br>
concentrated mill grind, which is subsequently diluted to the appropriate concentration for use in the inkjet printing system. This technique permits preparation of a greater quantity of pigmented ink from the equipment. By dilution, the inkjet ink is adjusted to the desired viscosity, surface tension, colour, hue. saturation density, and print area coverage for the particular application.<br>
[0058]  \n preparing the inkjet ink, it is preferred that one or more degassing steps are performed at one time or another for removing air or gas bubbles from the ink. Degassing is preferably performed by heating and/or reduced pressure. The degassing step{s) can be performed on the concentrated pigment dispersion and/or on the final inkjet ink composition.<br>
Pigments<br>
[0059]   The pigments used in the non-aqueous inkjet ink according to the present invention may be black, white, cyan, magenta, yellow, red, orange, violet, blue, green, brown, mixtures thereof, and the like.<br>

[0067]   Particular preferred pigments are C.I. Pigment Orange 5, 13, 16, 34, 40, 43, 59, 66, 67, 69, 71 and 73.<br>
[0068]   Particular preferred pigments are C.I. Pigment Green 7 and 36.<br>
[0069]   Particular preferred pigments are C.I. Pigment Brown 6 and 7.<br>
[0070]  Suitable pigments include mixed crystals of the above particular preferred pigments. A commercially available example is Cinquasia Magenta RT-355-D from Ciba Specialty Chemicals.<br>
[0071]  Carbon black is preferred as a pigment for the non-aqueous black Inkjet ink because it always exhibits a warm brownish black tone.<br>
[0072]   Suitable black pigment materials include carbon blacks such as Pigment Black 7 (e.g. Carbon Black MAS® from MITSUBISHI CHEMICAL), Regal® 400R, Mogul® L, Elftex® 320 from CABOT Co., or Carbon Black FW18, Special Black 250, Special Black 350, Special Black 550, Printex® 25, Printex® 35, Printex® 55, Printex® 90, Printex® 150T from DEGUSSA. Additional examples of suitable pigments are disclosed in US 5389133 (XEROX).<br>
[0073]   It is also possible to make mixtures of pigments in one pigment dispersion or non-aqueous Inkjet ink. For other applications than manufacturing decorative laminates a neutral black Inkjet ink is generally preferred and can be obtained, for example, by mixing a black pigment and a cyan pigment into the ink. The Inkjet application may also require one or more spot colours, for example for packaging Inkjet printing or textile Inkjet printing. Silver and gold are often desired colours for Inkjet poster printing and point-of-sales displays.<br>
[0074] Also non-organic pigments can be advantageously dispersed according to the present invention. Particular preferred pigments are C.I. Pigment Metal 1, 2 and 3. Illustrative examples of the inorganic pigments include titanium<br>
 <br>
oxide, barium sulfate, calcium carbonate, zinc oxide, lead sulfate, yellow lead, zinc yellow, red Iron oxide (III), cadmium red, ultramarine blue, Prussian blue, chromium oxide green, cobalt green, amber, titanium black and synthetic iron blacl<.></.>
[0075]   Generally pigments are stabilized in the dispersion medium by dispersing agents, such as polymeric dispersants or surfactants. However, the surface of the pigments can be modified to obtain so-called "self-dispersible" or "self-dispersing" pigments, i.e. pigments that are dispersible in ttie dispersion medium without dispersants.<br>
[0076]   Pigment particles in non-aqueous Inkjet ink should be sufficiently small to permit free flow of the ink through the Inkjet printing device, especially at the ejecting nozzles. It is also desirable to use small particles for maximum colour strength and to slow down sedimentation.<br>
[0077]  The average particle size of the pigment In pigmented Inkjet ink should be between 0.005 and 15 |jm. Preferably, the average pigment particle size is between 0.005 and 5 [jm, more preferably between 0.005 and 1 pm, particularly preferably between 0.005 and 0.3 |jm and most preferably between 0.040 and 0.150 pm. Larger pigment particle sizes may be used as long as the objectives of the present invention are achieved.<br>
[0078]  The pigment is preferably used in the non-aqueous pigment dispersion used for preparing the Inkjet ink in an amount of 10 to 40 wt%, preferably 20 to 30 wt% based on the total weight of the pigment dispersion. In the Inkjet ink the pigment Is preferably used In an amount of 0.1 to 20 v/t^/o, preferably 1 to 10 wt% based on Hie total weight of the Inkjet ink.<br>
Dispersants<br>
[0079]  The non-aqueous Inkjet Ink according to the present invention contains at least two components: (i) a pigment and (il) a liquid dispersion medium. If the pigment is not a self-dispersible pigment, the non-aqueous Inkjet ink preferably contains a polymeric dispersant.<br>
[00801  Typical polymeric dispersants are copolymers of two monomers but may contain three, four, five or even more monomers. The properties of polymeric dispersants depend on both the nature of the monomers and their distribution in the polymer. Copolymeric dispersants suitable in<br>
 <br>
pigment dispersions according to the present invention may have the following polymer compositions:<br>
randomly polymerized monomers (e.g. monomers A and B<br>
polymerized into ABBAABAB);<br>
alternating polymerized monomers (e.g. monomers A and B<br>
polymerized into ABABABAB);<br>
gradient (tapered) polymerized monomers (e.g. monomers A and B<br>
polymerized into AAABAABBABBB);<br>
block copolymers (e.g. monomers A and B polymerized into<br>
AAAAABBBBBB) wherein the block length of each of the blocks (2, 3,<br>
4, 5 or even more) is important for the dispersion capability of the<br>
polymeric dispersant;<br>
graft copolymers (graft copolymers consist of a polymeric backbone<br>
with side chains attached to the backbone); and<br>
mixed forms of these polymers, e.g. blocky gradient copolymers. [0081]  Polymeric dispersants suitable in pigment dispersions according to the<br>
present invention may have different polymer architecture including linear, comb/branched, star, dendritic (including dendrimers and hyperbranched polymers). A general review on the architecture of polymers is given by ODIAN, George, Principles Of Polymerization, 4th edition, Wiley-Interscience, 2004, p. 1-18. [0082]  Comb/branched polymers have side branches of linked monomer<br>
molecules protruding from various central branch points along the main polymer chain (at least 3 branch points). [0083]  Star polymers are branched polymers in which three or more either similar or different linear homopolymers or copolymers are linked together to a single core. [0084]  Dendritic polymers comprise the classes of dendrimers and<br>
hyperbranched polymers. In dendrimers, with well-defined mono-disperse structures, all branch points are used (multi-step synthesis), while hyperbranched polymers have a plurality of branch points and multifunctional branches that lead to further branching with polymer growth (one-step polymerization process).<br>
 <br>
[0085]   Polymeric dispersants suitable in pigment dispersions according to the present invention may be prepared via addition or condensation type polymerizations. Polymerization methods include those described by ODIAN, George, Principles of Polymerization, 4th edition, Wiley-Interscience, 2004, p. 39-606. [0086]   Addition polymerization methods suitable for preparing polymeric dispersants for use in pigment dispersions according to the present invention include free radical polymerization (FRP) and controlled polymerization techniques. Suitable controlled radical polymerization methods include;<br>
RAFT: reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer;<br>
ATRP: atom transfer radical polymerization<br>
MADiX: reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer process, using<br>
a transfer active xanthate;<br>
Catalytic chain transfer (e.g. using cobalt complexes);<br>
Nitroxide (e.g. TEMPO) mediated polymerizations; [0087]  Other suitable controlled polymerization methods include:<br>
GTP: group transfer polymerization;<br>
Living cationic (ring-opening) polymerizations;<br>
Anionic co-ordination insertion ring-opening polymerization; and<br>
Living anionic (ring-opening) polymerization. [0088]  Reversible addition-fragmentation transfer (RAFT); con^oiied<br>
polymerization occurs via rapid chain transfer between growing polymer radicals and dormant polymer chains. A review article on RAFT synthesis of dispersants with different polymeric geometry Is given in QUINN J.F. et al., Facile Synthesis of comb, star, and graft polymers via reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization.

Anionic co-ordination ring-opening polymerization is e.g. used for the synthesis of polyesters based on lactones. Living anionic ring-opening polymerization is e.g. used for the synthesis of polyethylene oxide macromonomers.<br>
[0092]  Free radical Polymerization (FRP) proceeds via a chain mechanism, which basically consists of four different types of reactions involving free radicals: (1) radical generation from non-radical species (initiation), (2) radical addition to a substituted alkene (propagation), (3) atom transfer and atom abstraction reactions (chain transfer and termination by disproportionation), and (4) radical-radical recombination reactions (termination by combination).<br>

 <br>
[0120]  The non-aqueous Inkjet ink according to the present invention may contain at least one dispersion synergist. A mixture of dispersion synergists may be used to further improve dispersion stability<br>
[0121]  The dispersion synergist usually consists of an anionic part and a cationic part. The anionic part of the dispersion synergist exhibiting a certain moiecuiar similarity with the colour pigment and the cation'ic part of the dispersion synergist consists of one or more protons and/or cations to compensate the charge of the anionic part of the dispersion synergist.<br>
[0122]  The synergist is preferably added in a smaller amount than the polymeric dispersant(s). The ratio of polymeric dispersant/dlspersion synergist depends upon the pigment and should be determined experimentally. Typically the ratio wt% polymeric dtspersant/wt% dispersion synergist is selected between 2:1 to 100:1, preferably between 2:1 and 20:1.<br>

This water was not intentionally added but came into the formulation via other components as a contamination.<br>
 <br>
such as for example polar organic solvents. Higher amounts of water than 10 wt% of water based on the total weight of the dispersion medium tend to make the non-aqueous Inkjet inks instable, preferably the water content is less than 1 wt% based on the total weight dispersion medium and most preferably no water at all is present.<br>

Measurement methods<br>
1.	Average particle size<br>
[0180]   The average particle size diameter was determined with a Brookhaven Instruments Particle Sizer BiQOplus based upon the principle of dynamic light scattering. The ink or dispersion was diluted with ethyl acetate to a pigment concentration of 0.002 wt%. The measurement settings of the BIQOplus were: 5 runs at 23°C, angle of 90°, wavelength of 635 nm and graphics = correction function.<br>
2.	Pigment dispersion stability<br>
[0181]  The pigment dispersion stability was determined by comparing the<br>
average particle size of the pigments in the dispersion or the ink with the average particle size of the pigments of the same ink subjected to a heat treatment of 7 days at 83°C in a sealed container. The %growth based on the original average particle size was used as a parameter to evaluate the pigment dispersion stability. The smaller the %growth value, the more stable the pigment dispersion was. The %growth value should preferably be less than 40%, more preferably less than 25% and most preferably less than 10%. For preventing the clogging of the nozzles, the average particle size should also stay below 200 nm, preferably below 150 nm.<br>
3.	Viscosity<br>
[0182]  The viscosity of the Inkjet inks was measured using a Brookfield DV-II+ viscometer at 25°C and shear rate of 15 RPM.<br>
4.	Surface tension<br>
[0183]  The surface tension of the inkjet inks was measured with a KRUSS tensiometer K9 at 25'C after 60 seconds.<br>
5.	Optical density<br>
[0184]  The optical density of single color print patches was measured using a Gretag SPM50.<br>
6.	Cielab values<br>
[0185]  Printed samples were measured with a calibrated spectrophotometer<br>
(Gretag SPM50) to determine the coordinates of the L*a*b* colours system of the colour difference indication method specified in CIE (Commission International de TEclairage). In this case, the measurement was carried<br>
 <br>
out under conditions of liglnt source D50, provision of no light source filter, absolute white as reference white, and angle of visibility 2°.<br>
7. Latency time<br>
[0186]  The latency time was determined by performing a nozzle check of the<br>
Inkjet Ink on the Agfa :Dotrix printer at the start and after idle times. During the idle time the print heads were at rest without any maintenance and without capping of the print heads. The latency time was the time interval up to which all nozzles performed well in the nozzle check after the idle time.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
[0187]  This example illustrates the use of a mixture of specific polyalkyleneglycol dialkylethers improves the pigment dispersion quality and stability compared to a single polyalkyleneglycol dialkylether.<br>
Preparation and evatuation of ink-jet inks<br>
[0188]  All Inkjet inks were prepared in the same manner to obtain a composition as described in Table 1 and Table 2, except that the concentration of dispersion synergist and the type of solvent (the "dispersion solvent") in the milling mixture were altered. The concentration of the dispersion solvent in the milling mixture was compensated in function of the amount of dispersion synergist.<br>
[0189]  Amilling mixture with 15wt% pigment and 15vrt% dispersant was prepared by adding the pigment PB15:4, the polymeric dispersant Soisperse™ 39000 and the dispersant synergist Solsperse™ 5000 to the dispersion solvent. The millPng mixture was then milled under cooling by a NETZSCH™ LABSTAR1 at a 50 %volume filling with yttrium-stabilized zirconium oxide-beads of 0.4 mm diameter ("high wear resistant zirconia grinding media" from TOSOH Co.) and a residence time of 45 minutes.<br>
[0190]  The inventive non-aqueous Inkjet inks INV-I to INV-7 and the comparative non-aqueous Inkjet inks COMP-1 to COMP-3 were then prepared according to Table 1 and Table 2 by adding 65 parts by weight of a solvent (the "ink solvent") to 35 parts by weight of the milling mixture under stirring at room temperature.<br>

INV-2	125 nm	157 nm	24%<br>
COMP-2	126 nm	167 nm	28%<br>
INV-3	137 nm	169 nm	20%<br>
COMP-3	147 nm	193 nm	31%<br>
INV-4	109 nm	104 nm	0%<br>
INV-5	107 nm	104 nm	0%<br>
INV-6	109 nm	109 nm	0%<br>
INV-7	104 nm	102 nm	0%<br>
[0195]   From Table 3, it should be clear that the use of a mixture of<br>
polyethylenegiycol dimethylethers (PEGDME250) instead of a single diethyleneglycoi diethylether (DEGDEE) delivered more stable non-aqueous Inkjet Inks. The inventive inkjet Inks INV-4 to lNV-7 shovi/ that the use of PEGDME250 as dispersion solvent resulted in inkjet inks of superior quality and stability.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
f0196]  This example illustrates that a mixture of specific polyalkyleneglycol<br>
dialkylethers as dispersion solvent in the milling mixture allows a wider choice of ink solvents than when a single polyalkyleneglycol dialkylether is used for the dispersion solvent.<br>
Preparation and evaluation of ink-jet inks<br>
[0197]  All inkjet Inks were prepared in the same manner to obtain a composition as described in Table 4 and Table 5, except that the concentration of dispersion synergist and the type of solvent (the "dispersion solvent") In the milling mixture were altered.<br>
[0198]  A milling mixture with 15 wt% pigment and 15 wt% dispersant was<br>
prepared by adding the pigment PY150 and the polymeric dispersant SolsperseTf^ 39000 to the dispersion solvent. The milling mixture was then milled under cooling by a NETZSCH™ LABSTAR1 at a 50 %.volume filling with yttrium-stabilized zirconium oxide-beads of 0.4 mm diameter ("high<br>
 <br>
wear resistant zirconia grinding media" from TOSOH Co.) and a residence time of 45 minutes.<br>
[0199]  The inventive non-aqueous Inkjet ini^s [NV-8 to INV-13 and the<br>
comparative non-aqueous inkjet inks COMP-4 to COIVlP-9 were then prepared according to Table 4 and Table 5 by adding 65 parts by weight of a solvent (the "ink solvent") to 35 parts by weight of the milling mixture under stirring at room temperature. On diluting the milling mixture with water to prepare the comparative non-aqueous inkjet ink COMP-9, a precipitated and inhomogeneous slurry was obtained.<br>
[0200]<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
<br>
dispersion solvent were much more stable in average particle size than the comparative non-aqueous inkjet inks COMP-4 to COMP-8 having DEGDEE as dispersion solvent. Hence, a wider choice of ink solvents was available to adjust the ink for viscosity and jetting performance. Moreover, the average pigment particle size in the inventive inkjet inks INV-8 to INV-13 was smaller than in the comparative non-aqueous inkjet inks COMP-4 to COMP-8, which is advantageous for preventing nozzle clogging and for cohur strength.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
[0205]  This example Illustrates a CMYK non-aqueous inkjet ink set suitable for producing decorative laminates with a warm wooden colour appearance.<br>
Preparation and evaluation of ink-jet inks<br>
[0206]  All non-aqueous inkjet Inks were prepared in the same manner to obtain a composition as described in Table 7 . If a dispersion synergist was present, the concentration of the dispersion solvent in the milling mixture was compensated in function of the amount of dispersion synergist.<br>
[0207]  A milling mixture with 15 wt% pigment and 15 wt% dispersant was<br>
prepared by adding the pigment, the polymeric dispersant Solsperse™ 39000 and, optionally, the dispersant synergist to the dispersion solvent. The milling mixture was then milled under cooling by a NETZSCH"''^ LABSTARI at a 50 %volume filling with yttrium-stabilized zirconium oxide-beads of 0.4 mm diameter ("high wear resistant zirconia grinding media" from TOSOH Co.) and a residence time of 45 minutes.<br>
[0208]  The cyan, magenta and yellow non-aqueous inkjet inks were then prepared by adding 60 parts by weight of DEGMBEA and 5 parts by weight of PEGDME500 to 35 parts by weight of the milling mixture under stirring at room temperature. The black non-aqueous inkjet ink was prepared by adding 57 parts by weight of DEGMBEA and 10 parts by weight of PEGDME500 to 33 parts by weight of the milling mixture under stirring at room temperaturB.<br>

<br>
 <br>
[0212]  The excellent pigment dispersion stability is not only demonstrated by the average particle size rennaining unchanged after a heat treatment for all 4 inks, but also by the stable viscosity. A large change in viscosity generally leads to jetting problems and/or deteriorated jetting quality because the creation of an ink droplet by an inkjet print head is largely influenced by ink viscosity.<br>
[0213]  Each of the Inks of the CMYK ink set was degassed prior to jetting with the Agfa iDotrixTw single pass inkjet printer equipped with Toshiba TEC CB1 printheads. These piezoelectric drop-on-demand printheads are capable of jetting multi-drops within one dot (8 levels) with a minimum of 6 picoliter to maximum 42 picoliter per dot. The standard frequency used was 4.8 KHz/dot (7 drops) and the driving voltage was 22 Volt (ejection orifice diameter = 26 micron). The order of printing of the different inks at 300 dpi was first cyan, then magenta, yellow and black.<br>
[0214]  A series of printing experiments were perfonned on an uncoated white decorative base paper of 80 g/nf with a Bekk smoothness of 100 - 200<br>
