Maharashtra, India<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION DESCRIBES THE INVENTION.<br><br>
Field of the Invention:<br>
This invention relates to air purification devices.<br>
In particular, this invention relates to devices for disinfecting air which at the same time removes odour and stench.<br>
Still particularly, this invention relates to devices for air purification and odour removal from air, either generally or within a defined closed space.<br>
Background of the Invention:<br>
A large number of pollutants can be found in the air and water. Pollution of environments inhabited by human, animal or plant life is of grave and growing public concern. Indoor air contaminants cause major health problems, such as lung disease and allergies. The modern lifestyle and the need for energy saving dictates that closed spaces have an ever-increasing content of pollutants.<br>
The pollutants that are present in normal room air have a wide distribution of sizes. Polluted air may include macro-particles, such as dirt, dust particles, pollens, and smoke. Micro-particles, such as bacteria, viruses, harmful chemicals, and various odoriferous molecules, are also commonly present in polluted air. Pollutants can cause disease, including cancer, lupus, immune diseases, allergies, and asthma.<br>
The environment is also often contaminated with a variety of noxious and toxic gases including carbon monoxide, methane, sulphur dioxide, hydrogen sulphide and a broad variety of organic vapours. Closed office buildings,<br><br><br>
homes provide a greater risk of these pollutants being trapped inside. Moreover, confined spaces such as toilets provide a greater threat to the levels of normal breathing air.<br>
Hence, apparatus and methods for removing air pollutants and for eliminating stench within an enclosed space have widespread economic and therapeutic use.<br>
Air purification processes are known in the prior art. Air borne infectious<br>
agents can be controlled in three ways:<br>
i)     Dilution: by injection of fresh air.<br>
ii)    Filtration: by capturing microbes through high efficiency particulate<br>
arrestors commonly called HEPA filters,<br>
 iii)   Ultraviolet Germicidal Irradiation (UVGI)<br>
By dilution, fresh air is injected into the area being treated and a part of the spent air containing microbes is forced out into the outside environment. However, if the ventilation system itself harbours pathogens like molds, spores, bacteria, virus, fungi, yeast, protozoa, algae etc., this not only renders the whole system ineffective, but also elevates the risk of being infected through the said means.<br>
Filtration by HEPA filters captures the microbes and requires regular maintenance and cleaning. A rigorous protocol is to be observed during cleaning and maintenance. The worker has to wear protective clothing, mask etc. to prevent him being infected with infectious agents. The filter is to be removed very gently, without any bumps or jerks and the filter to be put in<br><br><br>
airtight bag and incinerated. If a fine filter is used, the pressure drop is higher and if a coarse is used, the microbes will not be captured.<br>
Ultraviolet Germicidal Radiation is a very effective way of killing microorganisms and preventing transmission of infectious agents. Proteins and nucleic acids are main constituents of all micro-organism such as bacteria, viruses, mold spores, algae, yeast, protozoa etc. They absorb certain wavelength of ultraviolet radiation energy which destroy and inactivate DNA preventing reproduction.<br>
Ozone is an allotrope of oxygen that can be formed when molecular oxygen, such as oxygen in the air, is irradiated by Ultraviolet light having a relatively short wavelength between 100 nm and 200 nm, particularly 185 nm. Ozone is a powerful oxidizer because it is not a stable molecule. It has a half-life measured in hours, and immediately after being formed, ozone molecules begin destructive reactions with contaminants in the vicinity. The use of ozone is hence, beneficial for sterilization purposes.<br>
Ozone is an effective agent for sterilizing/sanitizing, because of the fact that it is not selective in the reactions it initiates. It renders harmful hydrocarbons and pyrogens harmless by oxidizing them, and it destroys microbes including pathogens, either by reducing or destroying them or by cell lysing or oxidation. But the fact that ozone is not selective in its reactions, means that it is equally reactive to humans and animals. Long exposure to ozone at relatively low levels, or short exposure to ozone at relatively high levels; both are dangerous in effect. Caution must hence be observed to limit the<br><br><br>
production of ozone and its use in air purification within a closed area. Typically, the level of ozone must be maintained below 50 ppb.<br>
A low pressure mercury discharge lamp in a quartz envelope produces only two radiations of wavelengths 185 nm and 253.7 nm in the range 100 nm to 300 nm.<br>
Ultraviolet light at 253.7 nm wavelength provides germicidal action, whereas, at 185 nm produces ozone, which in turn provides sanitizing and deodorizing action.<br>
Prior Art:<br>
U.S. Patent Number 6,809,329 discloses an ultraviolet light system for treating air. It speaks of an UV tube lamp having two sections; one for Ultraviolet production with the production of ozone, and another for the production of Ultraviolet light without the production of ozone. The amount of ozone transmitted by the lamp is controlled by a movable annular sleeve. This invention however provides no synergy between the ultraviolet producing and the ozone producing lamps. This does not provide any limiting action on the production of ozone.<br>
U.S. Patent Number 6,528,021 discloses a system and method for treatment of hazardous biological materials being exhausted from sewer and grease trap vents. The hazardous emissions are neutralized when exposed to a mixture of ozone and ultra-violet radiation. This invention basically refers to an exhaust-type device and not for recycling air within a closed space.<br><br><br>
U.S. Patent Number 6,503,458 illustrates a device for purifying air within a room. It discloses an ultraviolet ray generator to kill bacteria, germs and viruses in the air passing through the device. This device also generates ozone for neutralizing undesirable odours through the air passing within the housing. There is no mechanism to limit the amount of ozone generated within the device and to keep it in within the acceptable limits so that the air is suitable for human use.<br>
U.S. Patent Number 5,601,786 shows a system and method for purifying air by employing a lamp that produces two separate energy intensity maxima. One is the ozone producing radiation that falls within one wavelength interval, and other is for germicidal radiation that falls within another wavelength interval. This does not speak of a simultaneous multiple-wavelength radiating lamp that provides a multiple effect of sterilizing, sanitizing and purification. Nor does it provide in-built ozone-limiting apparatus.<br>
U.S. Patent Number 3,745,750 reveals an air purifier that is an air treatment means in the form of an ozone generator or ultraviolet lamp. It is not purely an Ultraviolet-lamp based purifier. It works with a combination of filters for effective use.<br>
There is therefore need for a device that removes odour and stench and at the same time sanitizes the air, while maintaining the ozone levels within acceptable limits.<br><br><br>
The envisaged device in accordance with this invention overcomes the limitations of the prior art.<br>
Objects of the Invention:<br>
An object of the invention is to purify/sterilize/sanitize/deodorize air in a closed environment.<br>
Another object of this invention is to deodorize air in a closed environment.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to provide an Ultraviolet based air-purifying means.<br>
An additional object of this invention is to provide an Ozone based air-deodorizing means.<br>
A further object of this invention is to control the ozone released into the environment suitable for indoor applications.<br>
One more object of this invention is to provide an apparatus which provides the actions of purifying, sterilizing, sanitizing, stench removal, and the like and also limits the production of ozone for the said purposes concurrently.<br>
Summary of the invention:<br>
A key to the present invention is to provide high ozone throughput in the device yet have low UV radiation spill over.<br><br><br>
A practical embodiment of the device in accordance with this invention is a wall mounted or a free standing device which combines with a device for circulating air and which draws air continuously or intermittently from the surroundings and passes the air over a Ultraviolet germicidal lamp to remove odour and stench and to kill the microbes.<br>
A typical embodiment of the device in accordance with this invention comprises a disinfecting device having a purification chamber, and at least one Ultraviolet Germicidal lamp to irradiate the air; Ballast for operating the lamp; a fan to draw air.<br>
The purification chamber is typically fabricated from UV reflecting material but is not limited thereto. The lamp envisaged in accordance with the invention is a UV producing lamp. The lamp in the housing of the air purifier can be a disinfecting lamp which is used only for the purpose of disinfecting the air, without deodorising it. However, a lamp performing the function of disinfecting air as well as deodorising it can also be used. Furthermore, two distinct lamps can also be employed separately, one for the purpose of disinfecting air and other for deodorising air as well as disinfecting the same.<br>
Microorganisms, like microbes are transmitted through air. Transmission of infectious disease is dependent upon concentration of infectious air borne particles that can be inhaled by a susceptible person. For instance, droplets of various sizes expelled into air when an infectious person coughs or sneezes form aerodynamic nuclei 1 µm to 5 µm in diameter.<br><br><br>
In a preferable embodiment of the present invention, the UV lamp could be either ozone forming or ozone free. In case of an ozone forming UV lamp the unit acts as an air purifier/sanitizer and also as a stench eliminator. A non- ozone forming lamp serves as a purifier / sanitizer only, without being able to perform the function of stench removal.<br>
Some soft glasses of special configuration can transmit UV at 253.7 nm but none of the soft glasses can transmit 185 nm; and therefore a UV lamp made from soft glass cannot produce ozone. Therefore, a high purity quartz is used for the said purpose.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, a control gear for switching on/off the UV lamp, is incorporated. Typically, this includes an electromagnetic device comprising a choke with a stator. Alternatively, an electronic ballast of high frequency ranging from 15 KHz to 50 KHz can also be employed.<br>
This invention, envisages the emission of ozone producing ultraviolet radiation in the air. The ozone so produced not only destroys air borne microbes but also acts as a powerful oxidizing agent and oxidizes all organic moieties including stench producing ones, into non odorous compounds. However, what is also needed is a device which renders excess Ozone harmless.<br>
According to this invention there is provided a device for eliminating odour and killing microbes, said device comprising:<br><br><br>
(i) First means for emitting significant UV radiation having wavelength of 185 nm;<br>
(ii) Second means for emitting UV radiation specifically having wavelength of 253.7 nm; and<br>
(iii) Third means for forcing ambient air in contact with the first and the second means.<br>
Typically, the first and the second means are two different UV lamps.<br>
Alternatively, the first and the second means are part of the same UV lamps having different glass envelopes; the operative lower portion of the lamp constituting the first means and the operative upper portion constituting the second means.<br>
Typically, the first means is smaller than the second means.<br>
Typically, the first means to the second means is in the ratio of 1:3.<br>
Typically, the third means is in the form of a fan drawing air from the ambient and forming a current of air flowing in a controlled manner over the first means and then over the second means. Furthermore, the fan is used to enhance the air flow through the unit. In that event, the rate and magnitude of purification / sanitization of air and the stench elimination capacity of the apparatus increase with the rate of air flow. However, a unit with a small capacity may not have a fan to enhance air flow through it and can be easily achieved by the natural convection. The air flow by natural convection is achieved when the air which is in the vicinity of the UV lamp gets heated<br><br><br>
and so move up. The contaminated air from the atmosphere rushes in to take the place of the air which has moved up, thereby enhancing the air flow.<br>
Further, the first, second and third means are arranged in a chamber in a vertical configuration in which the third means is located either below the first means or above the second means and therefore air is either forced through the chamber or sucked through it.<br>
Typically, the first means consists of a UV lamp enclosed in quartz glass adapted to transmit UV radiation particularly having wave length of 185 nm and the second means consists of a UV lamp enclosed in quartz glass typically doped with titanium dioxide which is adapted to block UV radiation having wave length of 185 nm and transmits UV radiation having wave length of 253.7 nm.<br>
Typically, the device is adapted to provide UV radiation of wave length 185 nm so as to form air deodorizing Ozone; and further adapted to provide microbe killing UV radiation having wave length of 253.7 nm adapted to eliminate the Ozone and said device still further adapted to pass odour and microbe containing air to selectively deodorize the air with the help of ozone and kill microbes and de-ozonised air to an environment, typically a closed environment.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of this invention, the lamp made is divided into 2 parts; the lower quarter for the production of UV radiation of 185 nm wavelength which gives rise to ozone, and the upper three quarters for the production of UV light of 253.7 nm wavelength. Thus lower<br><br><br>
part of the lamp is devised to emit UV light preferably of a wavelength 185 nm, for ozone production and its said causes. The upper part of the lamp is made up of doped quartz material, which blocks UV radiation below 200 nm and controlled such that light emitted out of it is in the 253.7 nm range i.e. within the Ultraviolet range.<br>
Air is drawn either by blowing or by suction into the device. As the air passes through the housing within which the lamp is enclosed, it initially comes into contact with the lamp. This region is rich in Ozone. Organic compounds, particularly the odoriferous compounds are rendered odour free by the by ozone and some of the microbes are also killed. Thus the air gets treated predominately for stench removal. The air is then forced into the upper region of the lamp. This region is bathed with UV radiation. This radiation not only kills any remaining microbes but also renders harmless any excess ozone by converting it to the stable Oxygen form. Finally clean odour-free air emanates from out of the top of the housing into the atmosphere.<br>
In accordance with one variation of the device, the lamp adapted to produce ozone is also partially adapted to emit visible light.<br>
The lamp in accordance with this invention is typically operated with ballast for operating the lamp which may or may not be dimmable.<br>
The device may be stationary or moving and may be fitted to another device or within a conduit. Forced circulation of air over the device or bringing air<br><br><br>
in the vicinity of the device, typically within 3 to 4 inches causes the generation of ozone which is used for the purpose aforesaid.<br>
A particular embodiment of the device will require the use of an opaque protector that will prevent direct viewing of the lamp fitted in the device to prevent direct contact of the ultraviolet radiation with the eyes of the viewer. Typically, baffles are provided within the housing of the apparatus in order to avoid the exposure of the users with harmful UV radiations. More so, the baffles are designed and attached on the inner side of said housing in such a way that it does not obstruct the movement of airflow and are fixed close to the inlet and outlet through which the air moves. The angle of the baffle with the operative horizontal is within the range of 20° to 50°, preferably 30°. The air purifier consists of at least one baffle which is fixed at least near the inlet and / or outlet. The horizontal expanse, to which the baffles extend over the openings, as ranges from one-third to two-third, preferably to one-half of the width of the air purifier. The angle of the baffles with the operative horizontal is designed in such a way so as to minimize the obstruction of air flow through the openings and also at the same time to minimise UV exposure to the user.<br>
In a closed space or in the open, the device so made could be used to disinfect and at the same time remove odour.<br>
The device in accordance with this invention could be modified for use in a refrigerator or other appliance not only to provide light but also to remove odours and disinfect the internal environment of the appliance.<br><br><br>
It could also be used to treat fruits and vegetables.<br>
Brief Description of the accompanying drawings:<br>
Figure 1 shows the sectional front view of the air purifier device with a baffle plates in one configuration using one lamp.<br>
Detailed Description of the accompanying drawings:<br>
Figure 1 illustrates one embodiment of the air purifying device in accordance with the present invention, generally indicated by the reference numeral (100). The illustration does not in anyway limit the scope and ambit of this invention. The device (100) consists of a housing (12) within which is fitted a lamp (14) and a control gear (18). Operatively the device is mounted vertically. The housing (12) has an inlet port (20) and an outlet port (22). A fan (10) is fitted within the housing for drawing the air from the inlet port (20) to be discharged out or forced through the outlet port (22). The location of the fan (10) maybe near the inlet port (20) or the outlet port (22). The fan (10) draws air into the unit. The lamp (14) has UV producing ability of two wavelengths viz; 185 nm (the wavelength at which ozone is produced) and 253.7 nm (wavelength at which microbes are destroyed). A baffle (16), at an angle to the horizontal, preferably at an angle of 30°, is fixed towards the inner side of the housing (12) and just above the inlet from where the air is drawn in with the help of the fan (10). Likewise, a baffle (17)may also be provided near the outlet port (22). The operative horizontal distance (Dl) to which the baffles extend is equal to a distance ranging from one-third to two-third of the width (D2) of the apparatus and is preferably one-half of the width (D2).<br><br><br>
The lamp in the housing (12) of the air purifier can be a disinfecting UV lamp (14) which is used only for the purpose of disinfecting the air, without deodorising it. However, a UV lamp (14) performing the function of disinfecting air as well as deodorising it can also be used. Furthermore, two distinct lamps can also be employed separately, one for the purpose of disinfecting air and other for deodorising air as well as disinfecting the same.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, a control gear for switching on/off the UV lamp (14), is incorporated. Typically, this includes an electromagnetic device comprising a choke with a starter. For this purpose, an electronic ballast of high frequency ranging from 15 KHz to 50 KHz can also be employed. More so, the outer housing (12) of the apparatus may be made up of stainless steel, aluminium, UV resistant special plastics like teflon or any other suitable material. Baffles (16) &amp; (17) may be integral with or extending from the inner surface of the housing (12) and it can extend from either wall from base or cover.<br>
Typically, the baffle (16) must be located near the inlet, if the apparatus is placed at a height. However, said baffle (16) can be near the outlet also, more so when the apparatus is placed at a point below the normal eye level. Nevertheless, it is always safe to have the baffles (16) placed near the inlet as well as the outlet. Furthermore, the baffles (16) &amp; (17) may have an internal reflective surface &amp; external light absorbing surface.<br>
Further, the fan (10) is present at the outlet to draw in the air during forced convection. However, the fan (10) can also be placed near the inlet to push in the air through the apparatus. However, it is the inventor's observation<br><br><br>
that when the fan (10) is placed near the outlet, the rate of air flow is greater than otherwise. Also, if the size of the apparatus is too large, the fans (10) can be placed near the inlet as well as the outlet. Hence, the number of fans that are employed depends on the volume of the enclosure in which the apparatus is used. The rate and magnitude of purification / sanitization of air and the stench elimination capacity of the apparatus increase with the rate of air flow. However, a unit with a small capacity may not have a fan (10) to enhance air flow through it and air flow can be easily achieved by the natural convection. The air flow by natural convection is achieved when the air which is in the vicinity of the UV lamp (14) gets heated and so moves up. The contaminated air from the atmosphere rushes in to take the place of the air which has moved up, thereby enhancing the air flow.<br>
While considerable emphasis has been placed herein on the particular features of the preferred embodiment and the improvisation with regards to it, it will be appreciated that various modifications can be made in the preferred embodiments without departing from the principles of the invention. These and the other modifications in the nature of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in art from disclosure herein, whereby it is to be distinctly understood that the foregoing descriptive matter is to interpreted merely as illustrative of the invention and not as a limitation.<br><br><br><br><br><br></td>
