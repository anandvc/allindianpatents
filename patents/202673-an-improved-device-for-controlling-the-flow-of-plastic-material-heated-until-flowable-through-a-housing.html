				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a device for controlling the flow of plastics material, heated until<br>
flowable, through a housing, in particular a filtering device or a direction-control device for<br><br>
the plastics material, comprising a flow channel extending through the housing, and a plunger of circular cross-section longitudinally displaced in a bore of the housing transversely to the longitudinal direction of the flow channel and crossing the flow channel, wherein an unslotted scraper ring is mounted outside the housing on a portion of the plunger projecting from the housing, a stop connected to the housing being provided for the scraper ring so that the plunger is displaceable relative thereto.<br>
Various types of these devices are known. One example is a filtering device for plasticised thermoplastic material, in which the plunger carries a filter arranged in the flow channel when the device is in the operating position, the filter filtering out impurities from the plasticised plastics material. Another type is a device for changing the direction of flow of the plastics material. In this case, the flow of the plastics material through the housing is always controlled by the longitudinal displacement of the plunger. In the case of a filtering device, the aforementioned displacement of the plunger moves the filter into a screen-changing position or a backwashing position so that the filter can be replaced or cleaned (e.g. AT 395 825 B, EP 250 695 B). In the case of a direction-control device, the displacement of the plunger causes the plastics material introduced into the housing to leave the housing through a different outlet opening than during the normal operating state or, for example in the case of a gate valve, the plastics material is totally prevented from flowing through the housing.<br>
In devices of the described type, plastics material unavoidably escapes from the housing during the longitudinal displacement of the plunger, even though the plunger is displaced in the housing with minimum clearance to ensure as little leakage as possible. The plastics material forcibly drawn out of the interior of the housing during the movement of<br><br>
2<br>
the plunger is decomposed by heat and the effect of atmospheric oxygen. The resulting carbonised mass forms a hard layer which surrounds the plunger and which has substantially lost its plastics character. The purpose of the scraper ring is to scrape this hard layer of leaked material off the plunger during its longitudinal displacement relative to the housing.<br>
However, tests have shown that the following difficulties arise here:<br>
The portion of the plunger projecting from the housing is not heated and is therefore subject to a temperature decrease of approximately 100°C over its axial, non-heated length. This means that the diameter of the plunger is smaller at its end projecting from the housing than in the remaining portion by some tenths of a millimetre, depending on the size of this diameter, owing to the reduced thermal expansion in accordance with its lower temperature. Therefore, when the plunger moves into the heated housing, the burnt-on layer of material is scraped off by the housing edge or the scraper ring only until it corresponds to the bore diameter of the housing or the inner diameter of the scraper ring. Consequently, a layer of this material remains at the colder end of the plunger and is of a thickness conforming to the smaller diameter attributable to the reduced thermal expansion of this end of the plunger. During the dwell time of the plunger in the position in which it is retracted into the housing, e.g. the filtering position in the case of a filtering device or the normal position of the direction-control device or the like, this plunger portion heats up to the housing temperature and therefore expands accordingly. The coating of carbonised plastic on the plunger is densified as a result. This uncontrollably impedes the movement of the plunger back out again, possibly even jamming the plunger and with it the entire device.<br>
The object of the invention is to overcome these difficulties and improve a device of the initially described type so that its operation is more reliable. The invention achieves this object by the inner diameter of the scraper ring being smaller than the diameter of the<br><br>
3<br>
bore of the housing and also smaller than the diameter of the end of the plunger portion remote from the housing and projecting therefrom in the coldest operating state of that plunger portion so that the scraper ring is always pretensioned on the latter. This close fit of the scraper ring on the plunger means that the scraper ring is always pretensioned on the plunger, irrespective of the temperature-induced expansions or contractions which the plunger undergoes. Naturally, this means that corresponding tensile stresses occur in the scraper ring, but selecting the material for the scraper ring, in particular its heat resistance values, so that the tensile stresses occurring are absorbed without causing the scraper ring to fracture does not give rise to any difficulties because the temperatures occurring are at least substantially known.<br>
According to the invention, the inner diameter of the scraper ring is preferably smaller than the diameter of the bore of the housing by 0.12% to 0.15%. Experiments have shown this range to be suitable for most applications.<br>
The amount of pretension with which the scraper ring is mounted on the plunger portion is to be selected in accordance with the prevailing conditions. Generally, within the framework of the invention, the arrangement is such that the scraper ring is mounted on the plunger with an average contact pressure of 1000 - 2000 N/cm2.<br>
According to a further development of the invention, a clearance of 0 mm to 4 mm, measured in the axial direction of the plunger and bounded by the stop, is provided between the scraper ring and the housing. The zero value, i.e. no clearance, applies to devices used for low-viscosity plastics, e.g. PET premonomers or waxes or the like. With these plastics, there is also the danger of material leaking out when the plunger is extended and there is high mass pressure in the housing. In this case, the scraper ring without axial clearance acts like a gland. For high-viscosity plastics, however, the aforementioned  amount of clearance  between the scraper ring  and  the  housing  is<br><br>
4<br>
possible and, in the region of this axial clearance, leaked material can issue freely when the plunger is extended.<br>
The subject of the invention  is shown schematically in the  accompanying drawings by means of<br><br>
embodiments.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a device, formed as a filtering device for plastics material, in section along the plunger axis with axial clearance for the scraper ring. Fig. 2 shows a variant of the scraper ring, in section according to Fig. 1. Fig. 3 schematically shows the plunger-extended from the housing and the scraper ring removed therefrom, in section according to Fig. 1. Fig. 4 shows an embodiment without axial clearance for the scraper ring, in section according to Fig. 1.<br>
In the filtering device shown in Fig. 1, a housing 1 has a flow channel 2 for the flowable mass to be filtered, in particular thermoplastic material to be cleaned of impurities for recycling purposes. The material to be filtered enters this flow channel 2 through an inlet opening 4 in the direction of the arrow 3. The filtrate flows out of the housing 1 through an outlet opening 6 in the direction of the arrow 5. A bore 7, crossing the flow channel 2, extends perpendicularly to the axial direction thereof. A plunger 8 of circular cross-section is longitudinally dispiaceable in this bore 7, but guided with a close fit. A nest of screens 9 is incorporated into the plunger 8 and has an inlet chamber 10 for the material to be filtered, the chamber 10 having a larger diameter than the flow channel 2 and merging via a stepped shoulder 11 into a frustum-shaped outlet chamber 12 leading to the outlet side of the flow channel 2. A filter 13 for separating the impurities from the supplied plastics material is arranged between the inlet chamber 10 and the outlet chamber 12. This filter 13 has an actual filtering layer 14 which can be formed by a metal plate provided with fine through openings dimensioned so that the impurities to be separated out are held back. This filtering layer 14 is strengthened by a supporting plate 15 supported against the<br><br>
5<br>
shoulder 11. The supporting plate has channel-type openings 16, the diameter of which is substantially greater than that of the through openings of the filtering layer 14.<br>
An, electric resistance heater 17, by means of which the device and also the plastics material flowing in the device can be held at the desired operating temperature, is arranged on the outer casing of the housing 1.<br>
In order to be able to clean or replace the filter 13, the plunger 8, constituting a screen carrier, is displaceable in the axial direction (double arrow 18) in its guide formed by the bore 7. A drive (not shown) is provided for this purpose. As a result of this axial displacement, a portion 19 (Fig. 3) of the axial length of the plunger 8 projects from the housing 1 at least intermittently and is therefore not heated. This portion 19 therefore has a lower temperature than the portion of the plunger 8 inside the housing 1, or assumes this lower temperature over the course of time. Furthermore, as a result of the aforementioned axial displacement of the plunger 8, plastics melt, in particular of film thickness, is drawn out of the interior of the housing 1 through the unavoidable non-tight points and remains at least in part on the casing of the plunger portion 19 projecting from the housing 1. Because the portion 19 of the piunger 8 projecting from the housing 1 is exposed to atmospheric oxygen, the plastics melt on its casing is decomposed and, within a short time, carbonised. Consequently, it loses its thermoplastic properties and, during the course of time, forms a hard layer surrounding this plunger portion 19. It has hitherto been assumed that this layer is sheared off by the housing edge 20 when the plunger 8 moves back into the housing 1. However, this is only in small part the case because the portion 19 of the plunger 8 projecting from the housing 1 is subject to a considerable temperature decrease over its non-heated length, this temperature decrease being approximately 100°C when treating thermoplastic material. This means that the end 21 (Fig. 3) of the plunger portion 19 projecting from the housing 1 has a diameter which, owing to the reduced thermal expansion, is smaller by some tenths of a millimeter than the diameter of the portion of the plunger 8 still in the housing 1. Consequently, a layer of<br><br>
6<br>
carbonised plastics material, the thickness of which corresponds at any point to the aforementioned difference in thermal expansion, remains on the colder end 21 of the plunger 8 when it moves back into the housing 1. However, when the plunger 8 moves back into the housing 1, the previously cooler portion 19 of the plunger 8 is heated to the temperature of the housing 1 and therefore expands accordingly. The coating of carbonised plastics on the periphery of the plunger 8 is densified by this plunger expansion and impedes or prevents the re-emergence of the plunger 8.<br><br>
To overcome these difficulties, an unslotted scraper ring 23 is fixed to the side wall 22 of the housing 1 facing the free end 21 of the plunger 8 so that it cannot move relative to the wall 22 or can only move within limits during the longitudinal displacement of the plunger 8. In this way, the scraper ring 23 provides a scraping function, by means of which the plastics layer, which is carried by the plunger 8 when it moves out of the housing 1, is scraped off the plunger 8. To ensure this for all temperature conditions of the plunger 8 or its portion 19, this scraper ring 23 is mounted on the olunaer 8 with a pretension which exceeds ail temperature-induced expansions and contractions. It has been demonstrated that it is sufficient to dimension the inner diameter d2 (Fig. 3) so as to be 0.12% to 0.15% smaller than the diameter dD of the bore 7 of the housing 1, in which the plunger 8 is guided, this diameter d0 consequently also being provided at the edge 20 of the housing 1. The inner diameter d2 of the scraper ring 23 is therefore with certainty smaller than the diameter d, of the coolest point on the plunger portion 19 (front end 21) when the plunger 8 is extended. In this connection:<br>
where d0 has the meaning given above, a is the expansion coefficient for the plunger 8 and At is the temperature difference between the front end 21 and the portion of the plunger 8 remaining in the housing 1. As shown in Fig. 3, this smaller diameter d, results in a clearance s for the front end 21 in relation to the edge 20, wherein<br><br><br><br><br>
7<br>
The contact pressure between the scraper ring 23 and the portion 19 of the plunger 8 to be scraped should advantageously lie between 1000 and 2000 N/cm2. Care must be taken that the tensile forces occurring in the scraper ring 23 do not exceed the allowable heat resistance value of the material used for the scraper ring 23.<br>
The scraper ring 23 can be immovably fixed to the side wall 22 of the housing 1, e.g. by means of a screw connection 24 (Fig. 4). The scraper ring is then mounted on the housing 1 in the manner of a gland. This type of construction is suitable for low-viscosity plastics, e.g. PET premonomers or waxes. However, for high-viscosity plastics it is more advantageous to provide the scraper ring 23 with clearance, enabling it to move in the axial direction of the plunger 8 relative to the housing 1. This clearance 26 can be seen from the embodiments according to Figs. 1 and 2. It is limited by a stop 25 held by the screw connection 24. A clearance of up to 4 mm has proved advantageous. This clearance 26 enables leaked material to pass through the unavoidable non-tight points between the housing 1 and the plunger 8 at the edge 20 in the direction of the arrow 27 when the plunger 8 moves out of the housing 1. The embodiment according to Fig. 2 permits better discharge of this leaked material by providing the scraper ring 23 with a chamfer 28, in particular when the device is arranged so that the longitudinal axis of the plunger 8 extends vertically and the leaked material can thus flow downwards.<br>
As a result of the close fit of the scraper ring 23 on the plunger 8, as mentioned<br>
f<br>
hereinabove, the scraper ring 23 scrapes the leaked material carried by the plunger 8<br>
from the plunger surface when the plunger 8 moves out of the housing 1. The edge 29 -adjacent to the housing 1 - of the central opening 30 (Fig. 3) in the scraper ring 23 is chiefly effective here. Any material still remaining on the periphery of the plunger is scraped off the plunger 8 by the edge 31 - remote from the housing 1 - of the opening 30 in the scraper ring 23 when the plunger 8 returns, i.e. is retracted into the housing 1.<br><br>
8<br>
The device does not necessarily have to be constructed as a filtering device. The plunger 8 can also have the function of a closing member, for example, wherein the axial displacement of the plunger 8 has the effect of closing off the flow channel 2. A variant of this is to provide channels in the plunger 8 so that, when the plunger 8 is in the normal operating position, the flow of the treated material through the flow channel 2 is not impeded, whereas in a different operating position of the plunger 8, in which the latter is displaced axially in relation to the housing 1, the material enters the housing through the inlet opening 4, but leaves the housing 1 through an opening other than the outlet opening 6, the material flow being diverted accordingly by the aforementioned channels in the plunger 8.<br><br><br>
