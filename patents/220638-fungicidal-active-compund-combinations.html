"ACTIVE COMPOUND COMBINATIONS"<br>
BAYER   AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT,   a   German   company   of   D-51368 Leverkusen, Germany,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br><br><br>

Fungicidal active compound combinations<br>
The present invention relates to novel active compound combinations which consist<br>
of a known fluoro-benzothiazole derivative and further known fungicidally active<br>
5	compounds, and which are highly suitable for controlling phytopathogenic fungi.<br>
It is already known that isopropyl   l-({[l-(6-fluoro-l,3-benzothiazol-2-yl)ethyl]-<br>
amino}carbonyl)-2-methylpropylcarbarnate      has      fungicidal      properties      (cf.<br>
EP-A1-775 696). The activity of this compound is good; however, at low application<br>
10	rates it is in some cases not satisfactory.<br>
Furthermore, it is already known that a large number of triazole derivatives, aniline<br>
derivatives, dicarboximides and other heterocycles can be employed for controlling<br>
fungi (cf. EP-A 0 040 345, DE-A 22 01 063, DE-A 23 24 010, Pesticide Manual, 9th<br>
15	Edition (1991), pages 249 and 827, EP-A 0 382 375 and EP-A 0 515 901). Likewise,<br>
the activity of these compounds is not always satisfactory at low application rates.<br>
Finally, it is also known that l-[(6-chloro-3-pyridinyl)-methyl]-N-nitro-2-imidazo-<br>
lidineimine can be used for controlling animal pests such as insects (cf. Pesticide<br>
20	Manual, 9th Edition (1991), page 491). However, fungicidal properties have hitherto<br>
not been described for this compound.<br>
Furthermore,  it  is  already  known  that   1-(3,5-dimethyl-isoxazol-4-sulphonyl)-2-<br>
chloro-6,6-difluoro-[l,3]-dioxolo-[4,5f)-benzimidazole has fungicidal properties (cf.<br>
25	WO 97-06171).<br>
Furthermore,   it  is   already   known   that   substituted   azodioxacycloalkenes   have fungicidal properties (cf. EP-B-712 396).<br>
30	Finally,  it  is  also  known  that  substituted  halogenopynmidines  have  fungicidal<br>
properties (cf. DE-A1-196 46 407, EP-B-712 396).<br><br>

have very good fungicidal properties.<br>
Surprisingly, the fungicidal activity of the active compound combinations according to the invention is considerably higher than the sum of the activities of the individual active compounds. Thus, an unforeseeable, true synergistic effect is present, and not just an addition of activities.<br>
From the structural formula of the active compound of the formula (I), it can be seen that the compound has two asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms. Accordingly, the product can be present as a mixture of different isomers or else in the form of a single isomer.<br>
Preferred compounds of the formula (I) are compounds in which the amino acid moiety is formed from i-propyloxycarbonyl-L-valine and the fluoro-benzothiazoleethylamine moiety is racemic, but has, in particular, the (R) configuration.<br>
The formula (II) includes the compounds<br>

and<br><br>
Le A 34 161-Foreign Countries<br>
24<br><br><br><br>
It is evident from the structural formula for the active compound of the formula (V)<br>
that the compound has three asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms. The product<br>
5	may therefore be present as a mixture of different isomers, or else in the form of a<br>
single component. Particular preference is given to the compounds<br>

The compound of the formula (XVII) can be present as methyl N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl)-N-(methoxyacetyl)-DL-alaninate (metalaxyl, XVIIa) or as methyl N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl)-N-(rnethoxyacetyl)-D-alaninate (metaiaxyl-M, XVTIb).<br>
The hydroxyethyl-triazole derivative of the formula (XXI) can be present in the "thiono" form of the formula<br><br><br>
(XXI)<br><br>
15	or in the tautomeric "mercapto" form of the formula<br><br><br>

The guanidine derivative of the formula (XXV) is a substance mixture with the common name guazatine.<br><br>

From the structural formula for the active compouds of the formula (XXXXIX), it can be seen that the compounds can be present as E or Z isomers. Accordingly, the product can be present as a mixture of different isomers or else in the form of a single isomer. Preference is given to compounds of the formula (XXXXIX) in which the compounds of the formula (XXXXIX) are present as E isomer.

The active compound combinations according to the invention have very good fungicidal properties and can be employed for controlling phytopathogenic fungi, such as Plasmodiophoromycetes, Oomycetes, Chytridiomycetes, Zygomycetes, Ascomycetes, Basidiomycetes, Deuteromycetes, etc.<br>
25<br>
The active compound combinations according to the invention are particularly suitable for controlling Phytophthora infestans and Plasmopara viticola.<br>
The fact that the active compound combinations are well tolerated by plants at the<br>
30	concentrations required for controlling plant diseases permits the treatment of above-<br>
ground parts of plants, of propagation stock and seeds, and of the soil. The active<br><br>
Le A 34 161-Foreign Countries<br>
-41-<br>
compound combinations according to the invention can be employed for foliar application or else as seed dressings.<br>
The active compound combinations according to the invention may also be employed<br>
5	to increase the yield of crops. However, they have reduced toxicity and are tolerated<br>
well by plants.<br>
According to the invention, it is possible to treat all plants and parts of plants. Plants are to be understood here as meaning all plants and plant populations such as desired<br>
10	and undesired wild plants or crop plants (including naturally occurring crop plants).<br>
Crop plants can be plants which can be obtained by conventional breeding and optimization methods or by biotechnological and genetic engineering methods or combinations of these methods, including the transgenic plants and including plant cuitivars which can or cannot be protected by plant breeders certificates. Parts of<br>
15	plants are to be understood as meaning all above-ground and below-ground parts and<br>
organs of plants, such as shoot, leaf, flower and root, examples which may be mentioned being leaves, needles, stems, trunks, flowers, fruit-bodies, fruits and seeds and also roots, tubers and rhizomes. Parts of plants also include harvested plants and vegetative and generative propagation  material,  for example seedlings, tubers,<br>
20	rhizomes, cuttings and seeds.<br>
The treatment of the plants and parts of plants according to the invention with the<br>
active compounds is carried out directly or by action on their environment, habitat or<br>
storage area according to customary treatment methods, for example by dipping,<br>
25	spraying, evaporating, atomizing, broadcasting, brushing-on and, in the case of<br>
propagation material, in particular in the case of seeds, furthermore by one- or multi-layer coating.<br>
The active compound combinations according to the invention can be converted to<br>
30	the customary formulations, such as solutions, emulsions, suspensions, powders,<br><br>
Le A 34 161-Foreign Countries<br>
-42-<br>
foams, pastes, granules, aerosols and microencapsulations in polymeric substances and in coating compositions for seeds, and ULV formulations.<br>
These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixing the<br>
5	active compounds or active compound combinations with extenders, that is liquid<br>
solvents, liquefied gases under pressure, and/or solid carriers, optionally with the use of surfactants, that is emulsifiers and/or dispersants, and/or foam formers. If the extender used is water, it is also possible to use, for example, organic solvents as auxiliary solvents. Essentially, suitable liquid solvents include: aromatics such as<br>
10	xylene, toluene or alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated aromatics or chlorinated aliphatic<br>
hydrocarbons such as chlorobenzenes, chloroethylenes or methylene chloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane or paraffins, for example petroleum fractions, alcohols such as butanol or glycol and their ethers and esters, ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone, strongly<br>
15	polar solvents such as dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulphoxide, or else water.<br>
Liquefied gaseous extenders or carriers are to be understood as meaning liquids which are gaseous at ambient temperature and under atmospheric pressure, for example aerosol propellants such as butane, propane, nitrogen and carbon dioxide. Suitable solid carriers are: for example ground natural minerals such as kaolins,<br>
20	clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous earth, and<br>
ground synthetic minerals such as finely divided silica, alumina and silicates. Suitable solid carriers for granules are: for example crushed and fractionated natural rocks such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite and dolomite, or else synthetic granules of inorganic and organic meals, and granules of organic material such as<br>
25	sawdust, coconut shells, maize cobs and tobacco stalks. Suitable emulsifiers and/or<br>
foam formers are: for example nonionic and anionic emulsifiers, such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, for example alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, alkylsulphonates, alkyl sulphates, arylsulphonates, or else protein hydrolysates. Suitable dispersants are:  for example lignin-sulphite waste<br>
30	liquors and methylcellulose.<br><br>
Le A 34 161-Foreign Countries<br>
-43-<br>
Tackifiers such as carboxymethylcellulose and natural and synthetic polymers in the<br>
form of powders, granules or latices, such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol and<br>
polyvinyl acetate, or else natural phospholipids such as cephalins and lecithins and<br>
synthetic phospholipids can be used in the formulations. Other additives can be<br>
5	mineral and vegetable oils.<br>
It is possible to use colorants such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide,<br>
titanium oxide and Prussian Blue, and organic dyestuffs such as alizarin dyestuffs,<br>
azo dyestuffs and metal phthalocyanine dyestuffs, and trace nutrients such as salts of<br>
10	iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum and zinc.<br>
The formulations generally comprise between 0.1 and 95% by weight of active compounds, preferably between 0.5 and 90%.<br>
15	The active compound Combinations according to the invention, as such or in their<br>
formulations, can also be applied in a mixture with known fungicides, bactericides, acaricides, nematicides or insecticides, to broaden the activity spectrum or to prevent the development of resistance, for example. In many cases, synergistic effects are obtained, i.e. the activity of the mixture is greater than the activity of the individual<br>
20	components.<br>
A mixture with other known active compounds such as herbicides or with fertilizers and growth regulators is also possible.<br>
25	The active compound combinations can be used as such, in the form of their<br>
formulations or as the use forms prepared therefrom, such as ready-to-use solutions, emulsifiable concentrates, emulsions, suspensions, wettable powders, soluble powders and granules. They are used in the customary manner, for example by watering, spraying, atomizing, scattering, spreading, and as a powder for dry seed<br>
30	treatment, a solution for seed treatment, a water-soluble powder for seed treatment, a<br>
water-soluble powder for slurry treatment, or by encrusting.<br><br>

When using the active compound combinations according to the invention, the<br>
application rates can be varied within a relatively wide range, depending on the kind<br>
of application. In the treatment of parts of plants, the application rates of the active<br>
5	compound combination are generally between 0.1   and   10,000 g/ha,  preferably<br>
between 10 and 1000 g/ha. In the treatment of seeds, the application rates of the<br>
active compound combination are generally between 0.001 and 50 g per kilogram of<br>
seed, preferably between 0.01 and 10 g per kilogram of seed. In the treatment of the<br>
soil, the application rates of the active compound combination are generally between<br>
10	0.1 and 10,000 g/ha, preferably between 1 and 5000 g/ha.<br>
The good fungicidal activity of the active compound combinations according to the<br>
invention   is  evident  from  the  examples  below.   While  the   individual   active<br>
compounds   exhibit   weaknesses   with   regard   to   the   fungicidal   activity,   the<br>
15	combinations have an activity which exceeds the sum of individual activities.<br>
A synergistic effect of fungicides is always present when the fungicidal activity of the active compound combinations exceeds the total of the activities of the active compounds when applied individually. 20<br>
The expected activity for a given combination of two active compounds can be calculated as follows (cf. Colby, S.R., "Calculating Synergistic and Antagonistic Responses of Herbicide Combinations", Weeds 15, (1967), 20-22):<br>
25	If<br>
X	is the efficacy when applying active compound A at an application rate of<br>
m g/ha,<br>
30	Y	is the efficacy when applying active compound B at an application rate of<br>
n g/ha and<br><br>
Le A 34 161-Foreign Countries<br>
-45-<br>
E	is the efficacy when applying the active compounds A and B at an application<br>
rate of m and n g/ha,<br>
5	then<br><br>
The efficacy is calculated in %. 0% is an efficacy which corresponds to that of the control, whereas an efficacy of 100% means that no infection is observed.<br>
0<br>
If the actual fungicidal activity exceeds the calculated value, then the activity of the combination is superadditive, i.e. a synergistic effect exists. In this case, the efficacy which was actually observed must be greater than the value for the expected efficacy (E) calculated from the abovementioned formula.<br>
5<br>
The examples that follow illustrate the invention. However, the invention is not limited to the examples.<br><br>

Example 1<br>
Phytophthora test (tomato) / protective<br>
Solvent:	47 parts by weight of acetone<br>
5	Emulsifier:	3 parts by weight of alkylaryl polyglycol ether<br>
To produce a suitable preparation of active compound, 1 part by weight of active<br>
compound or active compound combination is mixed with the stated amounts of<br>
solvent and emulsifier, and the concentrate is diluted with water to the desired<br>
10	concentration, or a commercial formulation of active compound or active compound<br>
combination is diluted with water to the desired concentration.<br>
To test for protective activity, young plants are sprayed with the active compound<br>
preparation at the stated application rate. After the spray coating has dried on, the<br>
15	plants are inoculated with an aqueous spore suspension of Phytophthora infestans.<br>
The plants are then placed in an incubation cabin at about 20°C and 100% relative atmospheric humidity.<br>
Evaluation is carried out 3 days after the inoculation. 0% means an efficacy which<br>
20	corresponds to that of the control, whereas an efficacy of 100% means that no<br>
infection is observed.<br>
The activity found for the active compound combination according to the invention is<br>
greater than the calculated activity, i.e. there is a synergistic effect. At a mixing ratio<br>
25	of 1:1 and an application rate of 0.1 g/ha, the combination of the compound of the<br>
formula (I) and the halogeno-benzimidazole of the formula No. XXVII has an actual efficacy of 73%. At 63%, the expected value, calculated using Colby"s formula, is considerably lower.<br>
