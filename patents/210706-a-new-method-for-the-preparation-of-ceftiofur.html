				<td>Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method for the preparation of Ceftiofur acid of the formula (I)<br><br>
and its pharmaceutically acceptable salt such as sodium or hydrochloride.<br>
The present invention also provides two new intermediates of the formulae (V) and (VI)<br><br>
wherein X represents halogen atom such as chlorine or bromine; R represents p-methoxybenzyl, p-nitrobenzyl or diphenylmethyl group.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Ceftiofur acid, its alkali metal, alkaline earth metal and amines salts were reported for the first time in US patent no. 4464367. During the course of further investigation, later on, it was discovered that all these derivatives of Ceftiofur are known to have stability problems. Further, it was difficult to purify the derivative of Ceftiofur due to amorphous nature of the compound. In fact, from the beginning, preparation of Ceftiofur sodium has posed challenges to organic chemists regarding purity, stability and crystallinity.<br><br>
Several attempts have been made to prepare Ceftiofur sodium for obviating above-mentioned problems. One of the solutions was provided in US patent No. 4877782 by preparing zinc complexes of Ceftiofur which have better dispersibility in water and can be used in pharmacological preparations. US patent No. 4902683 also explains the isolation of more stable Ceftiofur in the form of crystalline hydrohalide salts which has better solubility and other physical properties, as compared to parent compounds. During the isolation of Ceftiofur hydrochloride salt most of the impurities present in the compound are removed during filtration. The hydrohalide salts as such cannot be used for parenteral administration, therefore it is necessary to convert a hydrohalide salt to sodium salt in order to use the drug as injectable.<br>
EP 0030294 discloses the condensation of the 4-halogeno-2-substitutedimino-3-oxo-butyric acid with cephem carboxylic acids by using PCI5. Another EP patent 0 842 937 discloses the formation of amide bond with cephem moiety by reacting with the thioester derivative of 4-chloro-2-methoxyimino-3-oxo-butyric acid. The thioester was prepared by reacting 4-chloro-2- methoxyimino-3-oxo-butyric acid with 2,2"-dithio-bis-benzothiazole in the presence of triphenyl phosphine which is costly material and its by product triphenyl phosphine oxide is also difficult to remove from the reaction mixture.<br>
Objectives of the Invention<br>
The primary objective of the invention is to provide a new method for the preparation of Ceftiofur acid of the formula (I), which would be easy to implement in commercial scales.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide the novel intermediates of the formulae (V) and (VI), which are useful in the preparation of Ceftiofur derivatives.<br><br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of intermediates of the general formulae (V) and (VI), in good yields with high purity.<br>

presence of a solvent at a temperature in the range of -40 °C to 0 °C to produce<br>
a compound of formula (V), where R is as defined earlier,<br>
(ii)      cyclising the compound of formula (V) with thiourea in the presence of<br>
water miscible solvent and sodium acetate at room temperature to produce<br>

(iii)     deesterifying the compound of formula (VI) using anisole/trifluoroacetic<br>
acid, phenol/ trifluoroacetic acid, formic acid   in the presence or absence of a<br>
solvent at a temperature in the range of 0 °C to 10 °C to produce a compound of<br>
formula (I) and<br>
(iv)     converting   the   compound   of formula   (I),   to   its  pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt.<br>
The process is as shown in Scheme-1 below:<br><br><br><br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the compound of formula (IV), can be prepared by a process which comprises protecting the compound of the formula (VII) using p-methoxybenzyl halide, p-nitrobenzyl halide, or diphenylmethane halide or diphenyldiazomethane, in the presence of a solvent and base.<br><br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, there is provided an alternate process for the preparation of compound of formula (IV), which comprises :<br>
(i) condensing the 7-aminocephalosporin derivative of the formula (VIII) wherein Rj represents hydrogen, (Ci-C4)alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted phenyl or substituted or unsubstituted phenoxy with furyl-2-carbonylthiol of the formula (IX) in the presence in an organic solvent and a base at a temperature in the range of 0 °C to 30 °C to produce 7-aminocephalosporin derivative of the formula (X),<br>
(ii)      removing the acyl   group on the N-atom in the 7-aminocephalosporin derivative   of the   formula   (X)   using   PCl5/POCl3/pyridine,   PCl5/pyridine, triphenyl phosphite/Cl2 complexes in the presence of an alcohol, at a temperature in the range of -40 °C to 0 °C to produce a compound of the formula (IV) and (iii)     isolating the compound of formula (IV).<br>

wherein the activated derivative is an acid halide, a mixed anhydride or active amides; X represents halogen atom selected from chlorine or bromine, with silylated derivative of 7-amino cephalosporin of the formula (IV)<br><br>
wherein R represents p-methoxybenzyl, p-nitrobenzyl or diphenylmethyl group in the presence of a solvent at a temperature in the range of -40 °C to 0 °C to produce a compound of formula (V)<br><br>
wherein R is as defined earlier,<br><br>
(ii) cyclising the compound of formula (V) with thiourea in the presence of water miscible solvent and sodium acetate at room temperature to produce cephalosporin compounds of the formula (VI)<br><br>
wherein R is as defined earlier,<br>
(iii)     deesterifying the compound of formula (VI) to produce a compound of<br>
formula (I) using anisole/trifluoroacetic acid, phenol/ trifluoroacetic acid, formic<br>
acid in the presence or absence of a solvent at a temperature in the range of 0<br>
°C to 10 °C and<br>
(iv)     converting   the   compound   of  formula   (I),   to   its   pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt.<br>
2.	The process of claim 1, wherein said compound of formula (I) is a syn isomer.<br>
3.	The process of claim 1, wherein the condensation in step (i) is performed by using the activated compound of formula (III) in the presence of a solvent selected from dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, tetrahydrofuran, aromatic hydrocarbon, acetone, dioxane, acetonitrile, N,N-dimethylformamide, dialkylethers or mixtures thereof.<br>
4.	The process of claim 1, wherein the acid halide used is acid chlorides or acid bromides.<br>
5.	The process of claim 1, wherein the mixed anhydride used is anhydrides of the compounds of formula (III) with pivaloyl chloride, ethyl chloroformate or benzyl chloro formate.<br><br>
6.	The process of claim 1, wherein the cyclisation in step (ii) is carried out using a mixture of water and organic solvent selected from tetrahydrofuran, acetone, acetonitrile, N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, dioxane, (Ci-C3)alcohol or mixtures thereof.<br>
7.	The process of claim 1, wherein the deesterification in step (iii) is carried out using anisole/trifluoroacetic acid, phenol/ trifluoroacetic acid, formic acid in the absence or presence of dichloromethane as a solvent.</td>
