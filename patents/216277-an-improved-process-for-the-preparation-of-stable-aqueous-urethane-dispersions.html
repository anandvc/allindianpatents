				<td>This invention relates to a process for the preparation of stable aqueous polyurethane dispersions. More particularly it relates to a process for the preparation of aqueous polyurethane dispersions by reacting a polyester polyol, preferably, branched and more preferably, a polyester polyol containing a long chain triol, having a number average molecular weight of about 300-3000 and containing<br>
i.    an ionic group of about 2-100 milliequivalents per 100 gram of prepolymer; ii.   optionally a polyether polyol, preferably poly(propyleneglycol) of moiecul-ar<br>
weight 500-5000, and iii. aliphatic or aromatic isocyanate having functionality &gt; 2.<br>
The isocyanate terminated and carboxyl group containing prepolymer prepared as described above.upon neutralisation with amines, preferably, tertiary amines, gives stable aqueous dispersions of polyurethanes.<br>
Polyurethanes are used for a wide range of commercial applications such as adhesives, coatings on different substrates including textiles, plastics, wood, glass fibers, metals and the like due to their extremely good chemical and abrasion resistance, toughness, flexibility and durability. Conventionally, these polyurethane coating products are diluted with organic solvents to get desirable consistency before application. As the coating dries, these organic solvent vapors escape into the atmosphere. This is both economically and environmentally disadvantageous on account of the higher cost of organic solvents, and the pollution and health hazards caused by such fugitive emissions. More importantly, these organic vapors pollute the atmosphere and create serious health hazards.<br><br>
Many approaches are reported in prior art to form polyurethane coatings from the dispersion of these polymers in water. The use of water is economically advantageous as well as it does not pollute the atmosphere. However, polyurethane polymers are not compatible with water i.e they do not form stable dispersions in water until special process and/or special monomer(s) are used in their preparation.<br>
One such approach in the prior art is the use of external emulsifiers to disperse and stabilise the polymers in water (US Patent 2,968,575). Though these emulsifiers stabilise the polymer in water, they posses the disadvantage that such coatings are themselves sensitive to water, and hence give poor coating performance in terms of hydrolytic stability. To overcome the above draw back, ionic groups are incorporated into the polyurethane backbone during polymerisation. Upon neutralising these ionic groups the respective salts formed act as an internal emulsifier. One such approach (Neth. Pat. Appln. 6,410,928) discloses the use of cationic ionomers for preparing polyurethane latexes. In another approach (Ger. Offen. 2,744,544) polyurethane production was disclosed using anionic ionomers. The incorporation of nonionic emulsifiers in the polyurethane back bone is disclosed in U.S.Pat 4,190,566. Further improvements in properties of coating derived from polyurethane dispersion are obtained by combining both ionic and non- ionic group in the polymer back bone. This has been disclosed in U.S.Pat 4,238,378.<br>
These prior art patents are related to the production of linear polyurethane dispersions. Coatings derived from these linear polyurethane dispersions possess limited water resistance and do not have good solvent resistance.<br><br>
Ger Pat. 4,237,965 discloses the production of aqueous polyurethane binders from dimer diol and trimethylol propane as isocyanate reactive group for stoving lacquers. Herein, branching in the diol is expected to increase water resistance along with other important properties. Nevertheless, the externally added short chain triol increases the prepolymer viscosity, resulting in the reduction of the solid content of the dispersion to about 25%. Jap.Pat. 06,329,744 and Jap.Pat. 06,93,068 disclose the production of water dispersible polyurethane resin using trimethylol propane along with other isocyanate reactive components. The externally added short chain triol contributes more to the hard segment of the polymer. Further, crosslinking with aminoplast resins results in coatings with diminished flexibility and more prone to cracking.<br>
Polyurethane dispersions disclosed in the prior art are normally derived from linear diols as one of the isocyanate reactive component and some quantity of short chain triols to impart a certain degree of branching / crosslinking . The main disadvantage of using short chain triols externally are a) undesirable increase in viscosity during prepolymer production b) insufficient branching/crosslinking c) short chain triols contribute more to hard segment and cracking of film is observed d) poor hydrolytic stability.<br>
Therefore, the object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of stable aqueous polyurethane dispersions which are stable over a wide range of temperature and under high shear force.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to obtain coating with good water and chemical resistance particularly when crosslinked with aminoplast resins.<br><br>
Yet .another object of the present invention is to provide a coaling with superior flexibility.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved process for preparation of stable aqueous polyurethane dispersions which comprises, preparing an isocyanate terminated carboxyl group containing prepolymer by preparing a solution of a polyol in an organic solvent, adding an ionic group containing compound in the range of 2- 80 milliequivalents to this solution, heating this mixture to a temperature ranging between 40°C and 120°C, adding an isocyanate in this reaction mixture, either in presence or absence of a catalyst and stirring the mixture for a period ranging between 1 and 16 hours, . neutralizing this mixture with a base, cooling the mixture to ambient temperature and dispersing the mixture in water to obtain the aqueous polyurethane dispersions.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the polyol used may be a linear polyether and/or polyester diol which is normally used in polyurethane synthesis and, more particularly, branched polyester polyol of molecular weight in the range of 300 to 5000 more preferably in the range of 300 to 3000.<br>
In another embodiment the polyether/polyester diols may contain three or more hydroxyl groups, and having an hydroxyl number between 50 and 100 mg KOH/gm and acid number preferably less than 2 mg. KOH/ gm.<br>

In another embodiment the organic diisocyanate may be (cycle) aliphatic, and/or aromatic type. (Cyclo) aliphatic isocyanates are the most preferred one because of better UV/weathering properties of the derived film, exemplified by 2,2,4-trimethyl hexamethylene diisocyanate, 1,4-tetramethylene diisocyanate, 1,6-nexamethylene diisocyanate(HDI), isophorone diisocyanate(IPDI), 4,4'-methylene-bis- (cyclohexane diisocyanate), meta or para- tetramethyl xylene diisocyanate and α, α-xylylene diisocyanate. Examples of suitable aromatic diisocyanates are toluene diisocyanate, 1,4 phynylene diisocyanate, 4,4'-diphynyl methane diisocyanate, meta or para-tetramethyl xylene diisocyanate. In addition to organic diisocyanates, polyfunctional isocyanates can be used in place of, or in combination with diisocyanates. Suitable higher polyisocyanates include 2,4,6-triisocyanato toluene, 4,4',4"- triisocyanate triphenyl methane, 1,2,4- benzene triisocyanate, biurets of diisocyanates, trimer of HDI, IPDI and TMP dducts ofTDIJPDI, HDI, MDI, TMXDI and the like.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, catalyst may be optionally used to enhance the isocyanate - hydroxyl reaction. Suitable catalysts include triethylene diamine, morpholine, N-ethylmorpholine, piperazine, triethanolamine, triethylamine, dibutyltindilaurate, stannous octoate, dioctyl tin di acetate, lead octoate, stannous tallate and dibutyltindioxide.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the base used for neutralization may be selected from primary, secondary, tertiary amines and / or alkali metal hydroxides such as substituted tertiary amines exemplified by, trimethylamine,<br><br>
triethylamine, triisopropylamine, tributylamine, N,N-dimethylcyclohexylamine, N,N-<br>
dimethylstearylamine, N,N-dimethylaniline, N-methylmorpholine, N-ethylmoipholine, N-methylpiperazine, N-methyl-2-pyrrollidone, N-methylpiperidine, N,N-dimethylamino ethanol, N,N-diethylethanolamine, triethanolamine, N-methyldiethanol amine, dimethylamino propanol, 2-ethoxyethyldimethylamine, N-hydroxyethylpiperazine, 2-(2-di methyl amino ethoxy) elhanol and 5-dicthyl amino-2-pentanone., or alkali metal hydroxides like NaOH, KOH, LiOH and the like.<br>
In a feature of the present invention the branched polyester polyols are prepared by condensation polymerisation reaction between a hydroxyl and/or carboxyl terminated linear polyester and a polyfunctional polyol of low molecular weight. The linear polyesters are normally prepared from dibasic acids and a diol. Dibasic acids include, adipic acid, succinic acid, sebasic acid, azelaic acid, isophthalic acid, 1,4 -cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid, phthalic acid, terephthalic acid, tetrahydro phthalic acid, phthalic anhydride and tetrahydro phthalic anhydride. Suitable diols such as ethylene glycol, 1,2-propyleneglycol, 1,3-propyleneglycol, diethylene glycol, 1,4-butane diol, 1,3-butane diol, 1,6-hexane diol, 1,8-octane diol, neopentyl glycol, 2-methyl-1,3- propane diol and 1,4-cyclohexane dimethanol. The low molecular weight polyfunctional polyol include trimethylol propane, ditrimethylol propane, 1,2,6-hexane triol (its isomers), pentaerythrytol, di and tripentaerythrytol. sorbitol and glycerine. Polyesterification reactions are self catalysed by carboxyl group of the acid components, but, since the concentration of these groups decreases with increasing conversion, other catalysts are often employed to maintain the rate of reaction. Catalysts include protonic acids, lewis acids, titanium alkoxides, and dialkyl tin (IV)oxides. Strongly acidic catalysts tend to promote discolouration and hydrolysis<br><br>
of the product uniess they are neutralised and removed from the polyesters. It is preferred to use the approach via condensation with excess diol followed by base catalysed alcoholysis to obtain high molecular weight.<br>
In another feature of the present invention in combination with the branched polyester polyol the following polyols can optionally be used.<br>
1.	Linear polyester polyols which are derived from the reaction of dicarboxyfic acids<br>
and diols.<br>
2.	Linear or branched polyether polyols preferably linear like polyethylene glycol,<br>
polypropylene glycol and the like and more preferably polypropylene glycol of<br>
molecular weight 300 - 3000<br>
3.	Polylactones e.g, polymers derived from the reaction of e-caprolactone with<br>
dihydric alcohols.<br>
4.	Polycarbonates normally derived by the reaction of diols and diaryl carbonates or<br>
phosgene.<br>
5.	Polythioethers, polythioether esters, polythio mixed ethers.<br>
6.	Polyacetals which are formed from the reaction of diols and formaldehyde.<br>
In another feature of the present invention the solvent amount should be sufficient to provide the prepolymer having a sufficiently low viscosity to enhance the formation of urethane dispersion. Low boiling solvents like acetone, methyl ethyl ketone are very often mixed with high boiling solvents, during the preparation of urethane prepolymer. Advantageously, the low boiling solvents can be removed from the dispersion either by vacuum distillation or by thin film evaporation. The high boiling solvents on the<br><br>
other hand are normally retained in the dispersion and enhance the coalescence of the dispersed particles during the process of film formation.<br>
In yet another feature of the present invention normally primary, secondary and hydroxyl group containing amines are not preferred because they react with the free isocyanates of the prepolymer and thereby act as a chain terminator or chain extender rather to play the role of neutralising agent.<br>
In still another feature of the present invention the isocyanate terminated carboxyl group containing prepolymr is prepared by reacting branched polyester polyol, an ionic group bearing organic compound and an organic diisocyanate. The above components can be reacted simultaneously or sequentially to produce random or block copolymers respectively. Normally the ratio of isocyanate group to active hydrogen containing group is maintained between 1.05 and 3, preferably about 1.2 to 2 and most preferably about 1.3 to 1.6 on an equivalent basis. The temperature of the reaction between isocyanate and the isocyanate reactive groups is maintained normally below 150°C and more preferably about 40 - 120°C, and most preferably about 60-100°C. It is desirable to use an isocyanate non reactive solvent during the prepolymer production to ensure better temperature control.<br>
The neutralisation step may be carried out preferably before the formation of the' prepolymer i.e treating the component containing ionic group(s) and more preferably during dispersion stage i.e., addition of part or all neutraliser into water and most preferably   after   prepolymer   formation   but   prior   to   dispersion   step.   During<br><br>
neutralisation the temperature is maintained between 20 and 150°C, but normally conducted below 100°C and more preferably between 30 and 80 °C and most preferably between 50 and 70°C, with good agitation. Dispersion step can be carried out by any one of the following ways.<br>
a)	Water is added to the neutralised prepolymer with good stirring.<br>
b)	Unneutralised prepolymer is added to water containing the neutralising agent.<br>
c)	Neutralised prepolymer is added to water with good agitation.<br>
When dispersion is carried out according to step (a), initially viscosity pickup is<br>
observed. This is because, organic phase is continuous initially and as water addition<br>
is continued a phase change will occur, and viscosity of the dispersion is reduced.<br>
When dispersion is carried out in accordance with step (b), chain extension of<br>
isocyanate group takes place before neutralisation. This eventually leads to higher<br>
particle size of the final dispersion. Also, the dispersion step is obviated. This problem<br>
can be solved by the incorporation of more hydrophilic moieties and/or neutralising<br>
agent to water. Coating obtained from these dispersion becomes more sensitive to<br>
water due to more hydrophilic centers.  In the present invention dispersion is carried<br>
out according to step (c) i.e., prepolymer is added to water. The temperature of the<br>
prepolymer is maintained below 120°C, more preferably between 30 and 100°C and<br>
most preferably between 50-80°C. The water temperature is normally maintained<br>
below 80°C, more preferably at 50°C and most preferably between 25 and 40°C .<br>
Using this dispersion technique, it is possible to control viscosity pickup and higher<br>
particle size buildup of the dispersion obtained from step (a) and (b) respectively.<br><br>
The urethane dispersion obtained by this invention is branched and/or crosslinked (particularly via allophanate linkages). These dispersions dry at ambient temperature and find applications in coating industry preferably as an architectural paint, and leather coatings. The air dried film exhibits good water and chemical resistance. However, to meet the stringent specifications defined by the Original Equipment Manufacturers the polyurethane dispersions obtained by the present invention are crosslinked with aminoplast resins and cured at suitable temperature resulting in films with excellent water, chemical, abrasion, weather resistance. Amino plast resins used in the present invention include, melamine formaldehyde (MF), urea formaldehyde (UF) and other formaldehyde based resin system. Crosslinking takes place at elevated temperature normally above 80°C, more preferably between 100 and 160°C and most preferably between 120 and 140°C. The amount of aminoplast resin normally varies from 3 to 20 parts per hundred of resin (phr), more preferably between 5 and 15 phr, and most preferably between 7 and 12 phr.<br>
The single component polyurethane dispersions thus obtained are stable over a wide range of temperatures, possess good shear resistantance. The particle size is generally below 1.0µ preferably between .001 µand 0.5 µ. The average particle size is less than about 0.5 µ and preferably between 0.01 and 0.2 µ. A very small particle size thus obtained by the present invention enhances the stability of the dispersion and also the surface 'gloss of dried film.<br><br>
The process for the present invention is described herein below with examples which are illustrative only and should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention in any manner.<br>

To 180.0 g of the above polyester resin, 20.1 g dimethylol propionic acid and 150 g N-methyl-2-pyrollidone were charged in a four neck two litre flask equipped with a thermometer, a glass tube for nitrogen sparging, a condenser and a stirrer with three inch half moon blade. The contents were heated upto 70°C. The reaction mixture was<br><br>
kept at that temperature for one hour. 149.9 g isophorone diisocyanate was added dropwise using an addition funnel for about 30 min. The temperature was maintained at 70°C during this exothermic reaction. The reaction was continued till the isocyanate value reached 3.4% (thoretical NCO = 4.5%), as determined by dibutyl amine titration. Triethyl amine, 17.1g was then added and stirred well for 10-15 min.. 250 g of prepolymer thus obtained was then added to 235 g of water with Stirling to give an aqueous polyurethane dispersion with %solid = 35.82, viscosity = 524 cps and pH = 8.87.<br>

diisocyanate was added drop wise using an addition funnel for about 30 min. The<br>
temperature was maintained at 70°C during this exothermic reaction. The reaction was<br><br>
continued till the isocyanate value reaches 1.21 % (thoretical NCO = 4.5%), which was determined by dibutyl amine titration. 15.6 g triethyl amine was then added and stirred well for 10-15 min. 250 g of prepolymer thus obtained was then added to 235 g of water with stirring to give an aqueous polyurethane dispersion with % solid = 38.8, viscosity = 46.4 and pH = 7.4 .<br>

hexane triol was used in place of trimethylol propane. A linear polyester p'olyol is<br>
prepared by charging 106.8 g adipic acid, 101.6 g neopentyl glycol and 6.5g xylene in<br>
a four neck two litre flask  equipped with a thermometer, a glass tube for nitrogen<br>
sparging, a Dean and Stark trap attached with a double walled condenser and a stirrer<br>
with three inch half moon blade. The contents were heated upto 100°C and 0.12 g of<br>
dibutyltinoxide was added. The temperature was then increased slowly upto 220°C.<br>
The temperature was maintained at 220°C ± 2°C, till the acid value reaches 
milligram KOH per g resin. The polyester thus obtained had hydroxyl value of 145<br>
milligram KOH per g resin and an acid value of 2.06 milligram KOH per g resin. To<br>
the 195.5g polyester polyol thus obtained, charged 2.9 g 1,2,6-hexane triol, 19.8 g<br>
dimethylol propionic acid and 150.0 g N-methyl-2-pyrollidone in a four neck two litre<br>
flask  equipped with a thermometer, a glass tube for nitrogen sparging, a condenser<br>
and a stirrer with three inch half moon blade. The contents were heated upto 70°C.<br>
The reaction mixture was kept at that temperature for one hour. 131.8 g isophorone<br>
diisocyanate was added drop wise using an addition funnel for about 30 min. The<br>
temperature was maintained at 70°C during this exothermic reaction. The reaction was<br>
continued till the isocyanate value reached 3.8 % (thoretical NCO = 3.96%), which<br>
was determined by dibutyl amine titration. 15.0 g triethyl amine was then added and<br><br>
stirred well for 10-15 min. 200 g of prepolymer thus obtained was then added to 235 g of water with stirring gives a polyurethane dispersion with% solid = 36.23, viscosity = 30.6 cps and pH = 8.95.<br>
The film properties of the aqueous polyurethane dispersions are shown in the following Table. In deriving the data the urethane dispersion was cast on to glass plate and dired at 140°C for 20 minutes. Film properties were evaluated after 24 hours aging at room temperature.<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
The main advantage of the polyurethane dispersion obtained by the present invention is that they are suitable for coatings and non coating applications such as adhesives and sealants. They can be applied to a wide range of substrates such as plastics, metal,leather, paper, textiles, wood, concrete, porcelain, glass fibers for antistatic and crease resistance finishing, as a binder for printing inks. They are extremely suitable for chip resistance and weather resistance coating in automotive application, for furniture and air craft. Additionally, they are valuable cobinders for acrylic emulsion to improve flexibility, scuff resistance, water and chemical resistance. They can be applied on surface by means of brush, roller, spray and the like. Polyurethane dispersions obtained from the present invention showed better hardness coupled with flexibility and good hydrolytic stability. Urethane dispersion obtained by the present invention is largely unaffected by electrolytes and may be pigmented with electrolyte active dyes or pigments. Urethane dispersion mixed with aminoplast resins are stable over a wide range of temperature, shelf stable, storable and transportable. The dispersions are compatible with other dispersions for e.g. PVA, polyethylene, polystyrene, polybutadiene, PVC, polyacrylate and the like. The dispersions can easily be compounded with fillers, pigments (organic and inorganic), dyes, plasticisers and other additives such as silicones and thickeners.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
