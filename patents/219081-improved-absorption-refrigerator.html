				<td>SPECIFICATION<br>
BACKGROWND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an absorbing refrigerator excellent in<br>
thermal efficiency.<br>
2. Detailed Description of the Prior Art<br>
As shown in Fig.4, such an absorption refrigerator is known, as is devised<br>
to reduce a necessary heating amount by a gas burner 2 and reduce fuel<br>
consumption by sequentially sending the exhaust gas exhausted from the gas<br>
burner 2 for heating and boiling the dilute absorption solution of the high<br>
temperature regenerator 1 to a first exhaust gas heat recovery equipment 27<br>
arranged between a high temperature heat exchanger 10 of an absorption<br>
solution pipe 12 and a high temperature regenerator 1, and to a second exhaust<br>
gas heat recovery equipment 28 arranged between a low temperature heat<br>
exchanger 9 and a high temperature heat exchanger 10, and thereby the dilute<br>
absorption solution transported to the high temperature regenerator 1 from an<br>
absorber 7 is increased in temperature.<br>
Namely, in the absorption refrigerator of the above construction, the dilute<br>
absorption solution at about 40°C (at rated operation, thereafter the same)<br>
exhausted from the absorber 7 is heated by the low temperature heat<br>
exchanger 9, the second exhaust gas heat recovery equipment 28, the high<br>
temperature heat exchanger 10, and the first exhaust gas heat exchanger 27,<br>
respectively, to be raised up to around 140 °C, and flows into the high<br>
temperature regenerator 1, therefore, fuel consumption of the gas burner 2 can<br>
be saved.<br>
Moreover, the absorption refrigerator is so constructed that when both the<br>
exhaust gas discharged from the gas burner 2 and the dilute absorption solution<br>
supplied from the absorber 7 are at low temperatures, the water vapor<br>
contained in the exhaust gas is prevented from being condensed and dewed, by<br>
increasing a flow rate of the dilute absorption solution flowing through the<br>
absorption solution pipe 14 by increasing the opening of the a flow control valve<br>
29, and preventing the exhaust gas from remarkably lowering in temperature by<br>
decreasing heat recovering from the exhaust gas in the second exhaust gas<br>
heat recovery equipment 28.<br>
However, in the above-mentioned conventional absorption refrigerator,<br>
the flow control valve has been arranged in the absorption solution pipe<br>
bypassing the second exhaust gas heat recovery equipment, therefore, not a<br>
little of the dilute absorption solution has flown into the exhaust gas heat<br>
recovery equipment through the absorption solution pipe even if the flow control<br>
valve is fully opened.<br>
Therefore, when both the absorption solution and the exhaust gas are at<br>
a low temperature at the time of being started or the like, the exhaust gas<br>
temperature is excessively lowered even if the flow control valve is fully opened,<br>
and the water vapor contained in the exhaust gas has been condensed and<br>
dewed, and this has sometimes caused to corrode the heat exchanger and the<br>
exhaust pipe<br>
Moreover, most of the heat held by the exhaust gas discharged from the<br>
gas burner is recovered enough, therefore, when heat recovery of the exhaust<br>
gas is aimed at more than now, the exhaust gas temperature has become lower<br>
than the dew point of the water vapor contained in the exhaust gas even not at<br>
the time of starting operation, the water vapor has been dewed and sometimes<br>
corroded the heat recovery equipment and the piping part, therefore, the thermal<br>
efficiency needs to be improved by the other methods, and this has been a<br>
problem to be solved.<br>

and the refrigerant heat recovery equipment 11, and PF1-PF5 are differential<br>
pressure gauges for detecting pressure differences across the respective filters<br>
installed across them and are configured to output the detected pressure<br>
differences to the controller 33.<br>
In the absorption refrigerator of the construction described above, when<br>
the dilute absorption solution is heated and boiled in the high temperature<br>
regenerator 1 by burning town gas by the gas burner 2, refrigerant vapor<br>
evaporated and separated from the dilute absorption solution, and an<br>
intermediate absorption solution increased in the density of the absorption<br>
solution due to the separation of the refrigerant vapor are obtained.<br>
The high temperature refrigerant vapor generated by the high<br>
temperature regenerator 1 goes into the low temperature regenerator 3 through<br>
the upstream part of the refrigerant pipe 20, heats the intermediate absorption<br>
solution, which is generated in the high temperature regenerator 1 and goes<br>
into the low temperature regenerator 3 through the absorption solution pipe 15<br>
via the high temperature heat exchanger 10, radiates heat to be condensed,<br>
and enters the condenser 4 through the downstream part of the refrigerant pipe<br>
20 in which the refrigerant heat recovery equipment 11 intervenes.<br>
Moreover, the refrigerant evaporated and separated from the<br>
intermediate absorption solution by being heated in the low temperature<br>
regenerator 3 enters the condenser 4, being heat-exchanged with the water<br>
flowing through the cooling water pipe 25, to be condensed and liquefied, and<br>
entering the evaporator 6 through the refrigerant pipe 21 together with the<br>
condensed refrigerant supplied from the refrigerant pipe 20.<br>
The refrigerant solution collected in the bottom of the evaporator 6 is<br>
sprayed on the heat conductive pipe 24A connected with the cold water pipe 24<br>
by the refrigerant pump 23 lying in the refrigerant pipe 22, and is evaporated by<br>
being heat-exchanged with the water supplied through the cold water pipe 24,<br>
and cools down the water flowing inside the heat conductive pipe 24A.<br>
The refrigerant evaporated by the evaporator 6 enters the absorber 7,<br>
and is absorbed into the absorption solution which is heated by the low<br>
temperature regenerator 3 to evaporate and separate the refrigerant and is<br>
more increased in density, namely, the refrigerant is absorbed into the dense<br>
absorption solution which is supplied from the absorption solution pipe 16 by the<br>
absorption solution pump 19 via the low temperature heat exchanger 9 and is<br>
sprayed from above.<br>
Then, the absorption solution which has absorbed the refrigerant in the<br>
absorber 7 and has become thinner in density, namely, the dilute absorption<br>
solution is fed back to the high temperature regenerator 1 by operation of the<br>
absorption solution pump 17, 18.<br>
When the absorption refrigerator is operated as described above the<br>
cold water cooled by the vaporization heat of the refrigerant in the heat<br>
conductive pipe 24A piped inside of the evaporator 6 can circularly be supplied<br>
to an air conditioning load, not shown, via the cold water pipe 24, therefore,<br>
cooling operation such as air conditioning can be carried out.<br>
in the absorption refrigerator of the construction described above, a part<br>
of the dilute absorption solution to be fed back to the high temperature<br>
regenerator 1 from the absorber 7 by the operation of the absorption solution<br>
pumps 17, 18 passes through the low temperature heat exchanger 9 lying in the<br>
absorption solution pipe 12, and the remaining part passes through the<br>
refrigerant heat recovery equipment 11 lying in the absorption solution pipe 13,<br>
and they are heated by the respective heat exchangers<br>
Moreover, a quantity of the dilute absorption solution heated by the<br>
exhaust gas discharged from the gas burner 2 via the second exhaust gas heat<br>
recovery equipment 28 is controlled by the flow control valve 29 intervened in<br>
the absorption solution pipe 12, and the whole quantity of the dilute absorption<br>
solution to be fed back to the high temperature regenerator 1 from the absorber<br>
7 is made to flow through the high temperature heat exchanger 10 and the first<br>
exhaust gas heat recovery equipment 27, and is heated by each of them<br>
Namely, a part of the dilute absorption solution of about 40°C discharged<br>
from the absorber 7 to the absorption solution pipe 12 is heat-exchanged in the<br>
low temperature heat exchanger 9 with the dense absorption solution of about<br>
90 oC which is discharged from the low temperature regenerator 3 into the<br>
absorption solution pipe 15 and is flowing into the absorber 7, and the<br>
remaining part thereof exchanges heat with the refrigerant solution of about<br>
95°C in the refrigerant pipe 20 which is condensed by the low temperature<br>
regenerator 3 and is flowing into the condenser 4, and is raised in temperature.<br>
And, the respective dilute absorption solutions heat-exchanged and heated in<br>
the low temperature heat exchanger 9 and the refrigerant heat recovery<br>
equipment 11 join together to be a dilute absorption solution of, for sample,<br>
about 80oc, and flow into the second exhaust gas heat recovery equipment 28.<br>
The flow rate of the dilute absorption solution flowing into the second<br>
exhaust gas heat recovery equipment 28 is controlled by the controller 33 for<br>
adjusting the opening of the flow control valve 29 placed in the absorption<br>
solution pipe 12. For example, when the temperature sensor 30 is detecting a<br>
temperature higher than the predetermined 100°C, the controller 33 increases<br>
the opening of the flow control valve 29, and supplies more dilute absorption<br>
solution being returned to the high temperature regenerator 1 from the absorber<br>
7 to the second heat recovery equipment 28 to promote recovery of the heat<br>
held by the exhaust gas, therefore, the thermal efficiency is improved and the<br>
fuel consumption of the gas burner 2 is reduced.<br>
Moreover, the dilute absorption solution heated by passing through the<br>
second exhaust gas heat recovery equipment 28, and the dilute absorption<br>
solution, which does not pass through the second exhaust gas. heat recovery<br>
equipment 28, therefore, which is not heated thereby, are joined and pass<br>
through the heat exchanger 10 and the first exhaust gas heat recovery<br>
equipment 27, and exchange heat with the intermediate absorption solution<br>
flowing from the high temperature regenerator 1 to the low temperature<br>
regenerator 3 through the absorption solution pipe 15, and with the exhaust gas<br>
of about 200 °C exhausted from the gas burner 2, and flow into the high<br>
temperature regenerator 1 as a dilute absorption solution at about 140 °C,<br>
therefore, the gas burner 2 can save its fuel consumption.<br>
Further, the refrigerant solution which is condensed by the low<br>
temperature regenerator 3 and flows into the condenser 4 passing through the<br>
downstream part of the refrigerant pipe 20, exchanges heat with the dilute<br>
absorption solution of about 40oC in the refrigerant heat recovery equipment 11<br>
and heats it as described above, and the refrigerant itself is cooled down to<br>
about 45°C and is decreased in calorie to be radiated to the cooling water<br>
flowing through the cooling water pipe 25, therefore, necessary heat gain in the<br>
high temperature regenerator 1 can be decreased, and the absorption<br>
refrigerator is remarkably improved in thermal efficiency also at this point.<br>
Moreover, the rotation speed of the absorption solution pump 18 is<br>
controlled by the controller 33 so that the temperature of the dense absorption<br>
solution detected by the temperature sensor 32 after the heat exchange in the<br>
low temperature heat exchanger 9 is higher than the predetermined 40 °C,<br>
therefore, the dense absorption solution flowing through the downstream part of<br>
the absorption solution pipe 16 is not crystallized and clogging of the absprption<br>
solution pipe 16 due to the crystallization does not occur.<br>
Moreover, when the temperature sensor 30 is detecting a temperature<br>
lower than 100°C, it is possible to reduce the calorie to be recovered from the<br>
exhaust gas to the minimum of zero by fully closing the flow control valve 29 to<br>
the minimum, until the whole quantity of the dilute absorption solution is made<br>
to flow through the absorption solution pipe 14 by bypassing the second<br>
exhaust gas heat recovery equipment 28, therefore, the temperature of the<br>
exhaust gas exhausted via the exhaust gas pipe 26 is maintained at 100°C<br>
higher than the dew-point temperature (the dew-point temperature of the<br>
exhaust gas is 60-70°C when town gas, namely, natural gas is used as fuel),<br>
and so even at the time of starling or partial load operation of the absorption<br>
refrigerator when the exhaust gas temperature is low, water vapor contained in<br>
the exhaust gas cannot be condensed to produce drain water, and the drain<br>
water does not cause a corrosion problem either.<br>
Further, since the filters F1-F6 are installed on the inlet sides of the low<br>
temperature heat exchanger 9, the high temperature heat exchanger 10, and<br>
the refrigerant heat recovery equipment 11, scales are filtered out by the filters<br>
F1-F6 even if the scales enter the passages of the absorption solution and the<br>
refrigerant.<br>
Moreover, the filters F1 and F2 can be replaced with a single filter (shown<br>
by imaginary lines in Fig. 1) to be provided on the discharge side of the<br>
absorption solution pump 17 and on the upstream side of the branch part of the<br>
piping.<br>
Therefore, inconvenience of clogging the flow passages is not caused<br>
even when the low temperature heat exchanger 9, the high temperature heat<br>
exchanger 10, the refrigerant heat recovery equipment 11, etc. are constructed<br>
of plate-type heat exchangers improved in heat exchange efficiency by<br>
narrowing the flow passages as proposed in, for example, the Japanese Patent<br>
Laid-Open 1987-131196 the Japanese Patent Laid-Open 1991-271697, the<br>
Japanese Patent Laid-Open 1992-73595, the Japanese Patent Laid-Open<br>
1995-190649, the Japanese Patent LaW-Open 1995-229637, etc.<br>
Moreover, the differential pressure gauges PF1-PF6 are installed across<br>
the filters F1-F6, and since the differential pressure gauges are configured so<br>
that the controller 33 issues an alarm by the checking indication means 34<br>
when a predetermined pressure difference of, for example, 30kPa or higher is<br>
not detected across each filter, normal circulation of the solutions can be<br>
secured by cleaning the filters, and so on by observing the operation status of<br>
the checking indication means 34.<br>
Moreover, the temperature of the refrigerant which radiates heat by<br>
heating the intermediate absorption solution in the low temperature regenerates<br>
3 and further radiates heat by heating the dilute absorption solution also in the<br>
refrigerant heat recovery equipment 11 is lowered to around 45°C as mentioned<br>
above, the refrigerant does not need to be sent to the condenser 4 for being<br>
cooled down by the cooling water flowing through the cooling water pipe 25.<br>
Therefore, it is also possible to shorten the pipe length and simplify the<br>
piping structure by connecting the downstream side of the refrigerant pipe 20<br>
not to the condenser 4 but to the evaporator 6 so that the condensed refrigerant<br>
can be made to flow into it, as shown by an imaginary line (In Fig.1, the shortest<br>
parts of the refrigerant pipes 20, 21 are connected via the imaginary lines, but in<br>
a practical machine, the hot drum 5 is located on an upper side, and the cold<br>
drum 8 and the refrigerant heat recovery equipment 11 are located on a lower<br>
side, therefore, it is possible to place the evaporator 6 of the cold drum 8 and<br>
the refrigerant heat recovery equipment 11 adjacent to each other and connect<br>
between them via a short refrigerant pipe).<br>
Moreover, as shown in Fig.2, the flow control valve 18A is installed in the<br>
absorption solution pipe 13 instead of the absorption solution pump 18. Or, as<br>
shown in Fig.3, the rate of flow proportion control valve 18B is installed at the<br>
branch part of the absorption solution pipes 12, 13, and the flow control valve<br>
18A or the rate of flow proportion control valve 18B can be configured so as to<br>
control a quantity of the dilute absorption solution flowing through the low<br>
temperature heat exchanger 9 by the controller 33 so that the temperature of<br>
the dense absorption solution having radiates heat in the low temperature heat<br>
exchanger 9 is not detected at the predetermined 40 oC or lower by the<br>
temperature sensor 32.<br>
Moreover, it is also possible to determine and construct the internal<br>
resistance (the diameters and lengths of the pipes) of the refrigerant heat<br>
recovery equipment 11 and the absorption solution pipe 13 so that 10-30% of<br>
the absorption solution is made to bypass the low temperature heat exchanger<br>
9 and flow through the refrigerant heat recovery equipment 11, without installing<br>
the absorption solution pump 18, the flow control valve 18A, and the rate of flow<br>
proportion control valve 18B in the absorption solution pipe 13 (including the<br>
branch part/joint part of the absorption solution pipe 12).<br>
Moreover, instead of the temperature sensor 32, the temperature sensor<br>
32A is installed on the downstream side of the refrigerant pipe 20 so as to be<br>
able to detect the temperature of the refrigerant having radiates heat by heat<br>
exchange with the dilute absorption solution in the refrigerant heat recovery<br>
equipment 11, and thereby it is also possible to arrange the rotation speed of<br>
the absorption solution pump 15, the flow control valve 18A, the opening of the<br>
rate of flow proportion control valve 18B, etc. to be controlled by the controller<br>
33 so that the temperature of the refrigerant detected by the temperature sensor<br>
32A after heat exchange in the refrigerant heat recovery equipment 11 is, for<br>
example, the temperature of the dilute absorption solution detected by the<br>
temperature sensor 31 before heat exchange in the refrigerant heat recovery<br>
equipment 11 plus a predetermined temperature, for example, plus 5°C, and it is<br>
aiso possible to arrange them to surety lower the temperature of the condensed<br>
refrigerant directly supplied to the condenser 4 or the evaporator 6 down to a<br>
predetermined temperature.<br>
Further, the configuration may be made up to control the valve to<br>
open/close or to be switched by the controller 33 so that an exhaust gas<br>
temperature detected by the temperature sensor 30 is not lower than, for<br>
example, 100°C, by arranging an inexpensive on-off valve in the absorption<br>
solution pipe 12 on the upstream side of the second heat recovery equipment<br>
28 or arranging an inexpensive switching valve at the branch part (or joining<br>
part) of the absorption solution pipes 12, 14, instead ot the expensive flow<br>
control valve 29.<br>
Moreover, instead of the absorption solution pipe 14 hypassing the<br>
second heat recovery equipment 28, not only an exhaust gas pipe bypassing<br>
the second heat recovery equipment 28 is arranged, but also a passage<br>
switching valve is arranged at the branch part (or joining part) of the exhaust<br>
pipe. Or, a on-off valve is arranged in the exhaust gas pipe passing through the<br>
second heat recovery equipment 28, and thereby open/close or passage<br>
switching of the valve may be controlled by the controller 33 so that the<br>
temperature of the exhaust gas. which has flown through the second heat<br>
recovery equipment 28 and exchanged heat with the dilute absorption solution,<br>
is not lower than the predetermined 100°c<br>
Moreover, the absorption refrigerator may exclusively be used for cooling<br>
operation of air conditioning as described above, and may also be arranged so<br>
as to able to perform heating operation of air conditioning by arranging piping<br>
connection permitting to directly supply the cold drum 8 with the refrigerant<br>
vapor heat-generated by the high temperature regenerator 1 and the absorption<br>
solution from which the refrigerant vapor has been separated by vaporization,<br>
heating the dilute absorption solution by the gas burner 2 without making the<br>
cooling water flow through the cooling water pipe 25, and circularly supplying a<br>
load with water heated, for example, at 55oC by the heat conductive pipe 24 A of<br>
the evaporator 6 through the cold water pipe 24 (preferred to be called a hot<br>
water pipe when hot water circulates).<br>
Further, as a fluid to be supplied to an air-conditioning load by cooling it<br>
by the evaporator 6, not only water or the like may be supplied without phase<br>
change as described in the above embodiment, but also fluorocarbon or the like<br>
may be supplied with phase change so as to be able to transfer heat utilizing<br>
latent heat.<br>
Moreover, by installing the pressure gauges across the respective filters<br>
F1-F6 to detect the pressure differences across the filter, such a warning<br>
means can also be arranged as indicates cleaning the filters when a<br>
predetermined pressure difference is not detected across the filters.<br>
While the presently preferred embodiment of the present invention has<br>
been shown and described, it will be understood that the present invention is<br>
not limited thereto, and that various, changes and modifications may be made by<br>
those skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the invention as set<br>
forth in the appended claims.<br>
According to the present invention as described above, since the<br>
refrigerant heat recovery equipment in which a pgrt of the dilute absorption<br>
solution discharged from the absorber exchanges heat with the refrigerant<br>
discharged from the low temperature regenerator after heat radiation, bypassing<br>
the low temperature heat exchanger, and the rate of flow proportion control<br>
means for controlling the proportion of the dilute absorption solution branching<br>
to flow through the refrigerant heat recovery equipment and the fow temperature<br>
heat exchanger, are installed, the remaining heat held by the refrigerant<br>
condensed by heat radiation to the intermediate absorption solution in the tow<br>
temperature regenerator and discharged to the refrigerant pipe can be heat-<br>
recovered by the dilute absorption solution in the refrigerant heat recovery<br>
equipment, and the fuel consumption of the combustion equipment attached to<br>
the high temperature regenerator can be reduced.<br>
Moreover, the proportion of the dilute absorption solutions branching to<br>
flow through the refrigerant heat recovery equipment and the low temperature<br>
heat exchanger can be controlled, and for example, in the absorption<br>
refrigerator in which the proportion is adjusted by controlling the flow rate of the<br>
dilute absorption solution discharged from the absorber and supplied to the<br>
refrigerant heat recovery equipment based on the temperature of the dense<br>
absorption solution discharged from the low temperature heat exchanger after<br>
having exchanged heat with the dilute absorption solution, the dense absorption<br>
solution flowing into the absorber after having radiated heat to the dilute<br>
absorption solution in the low temperature heat exchanger can be prevented<br>
from being crystallized by setting the temperature of the dense absorption<br>
solution to an appropriate temperature.<br>
Moreover, in the absorption refrigerator arranged so as to control the<br>
aforementioned proportion by controlling the flow rate of the dilute absorption<br>
solution discharged from the absorber and supplied to the refrigerant heat<br>
recovery equipment based on the temperature of the refrigerant discharged<br>
from the refrigerant heat recovery equipment after having exchanged heat with<br>
the dilute absorption solution, the temperature of the condensed refrigerant can<br>
surely be lowered to a predetermined temperature by setting the temperature of<br>
the refrigerant to a suitable temperature, and thus a necessary amount of heat<br>
radiation by the condenser is reduced, and a piping arrangement directly<br>
supplying the condensed refrigerant to the evaporator is also possible.<br>
Further, in the absorption refrigerator arranged so as to limit the dilute<br>
absorption solution discharged from the absorber and supplied to the refrigerant<br>
heat recovery equipment to 10-30% of the whole dilute absorption solution<br>
discharged from the absorber and reaching the high temperature regenerator,<br>
the temperature of the dense absorption solution releasing heat through heat<br>
exchange with the dilute absorption solution in the low temperature heat<br>
exchanger is surely lowered. Therefore, the refrigerant is promptly absorbed<br>
into the absorption solution in the absorber into which the dense absorption<br>
solution flows.<br>
Further, in the absorption refrigerator wherein the fitters are installed on<br>
respective inlet sides of the low temperature heat exchanger, the high<br>
temperature heat exchanger, and the refrigerant heat recovery equipment, and<br>
wherein the differential pressure detecting means are also installed for detecting<br>
the differential pressures across the respective filters, and wherein the checking<br>
indication means is arranged for indication of checking the filters based on the<br>
differential pressures detected by the differential pressure detecting means,<br>
scales are filtered even if they enter the flow passages of the absorption<br>
solution and the refrigerant.<br>
Therefore, inconvenience of clogging the flow passages is r\ot caused<br>
even when the low temperature heat exchanger, the high temperature heat<br>
exchanger, the refrigerant heat recovery equipment, etc. are constructed of<br>
plate-type heat exchangers improved in heat exchange efficiency by narrowing<br>
the flow passages as proposed in, for example, the Japanese Patent Laid-Open<br>
1987-131195. the Japanese Patent Laid-Open 1991-271697, the Japanese<br>
Patent Laid-Open 1992-73595, the Japanese Patent Laid-Open 1995-190649,<br>
the Japanese Patent laid-Open 1995-229687, etc. Further, normal circulation<br>
of the solutions can be secured by cleaning the filters by observing the<br>
operation status of the checking indication means.<br>
