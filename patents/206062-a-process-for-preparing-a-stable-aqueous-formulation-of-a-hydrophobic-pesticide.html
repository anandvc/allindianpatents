"A PROCESS FOR PREPARING A STABLE, AQUEOUS FORMULATION OF<br>
A HYDROPHOBIC PESTICIDE"<br>
FMC CORPORATION, of 1735 Market Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19103, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the mvention jand the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
1-9-2005<br>
Original<br>
GRANTED<br><br><br>
-1 SEP-2005<br><br>
The present invention relates to the field of agrochemical formulations. In particular, the invention provides aqueous formulations of hydrophobic resticides that are stable and equally effective as compared with conventional formulations..    .<br>
Hydrophobic pesticides are commonly formulated as dry formulations because of their immiscibility in water. For example, U.S. Patent 5,125,958 ("US '958") discloses that the herbicide, ethyl (-2-dichloro-5-[4-(difluoromethyl)-4,5-dihydro-3-rhethyl-5-oxo-1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl]-4-fluorobenzenepropanoate (carfentrazone-ethyl), a viscous, oily liquid, may be formulated as granules of relatively large particle size, as powdery  dusts, as wettable powders, as emulsifiable concentrates, as solutions, or as any of several other known types of formulations. In addition, US -958 also discloses that carfentrazone-ethyl may be formulated as water-soluble or water-dispersible granules in which the water serves as a means for applying the formulation rather than as a component of the formulation. Furthermore, U.S. Patent 5,935,905 ("US '905) claims a dry formulation of carfentrazone-ethyl and N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine (glyphosate). Both US '958 and '905 require absorbing the technical grade carfentrazone-ethyl on to a carrier in order to formulate the carfentrazone-ethyl. Although the formulations were intended to have a long shelf life, it has been found that they tend to hydrolyze and as such tend not to be stable. As a result, a need exists to develop formulations of hydrophobic pesticides, in particular carfentrazone-ethyl, that exhibit greater stability.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides new pesticide formulations that are aqueous, economical, environmentally friendly, and exhibit little or no hydrolysis over time thus resulting in enhanced stability characteristics of the pesticidal activity. By reducing or minimizing the use of organic solvents, the costs and dangers associated with-the recycling of such<br><br>
materials are avoided. In addition, the.process can be conducted in relatively simple equipment using relatively simple process steps.<br>
'In one embodiment, the present invention provides pesticidally effective, stable, aqueous formulations of hydrophobic pesticides.<br>
According to one aspect of the invention, the formulation comprises an aqueous emulsion (EW), which is composed of an aqueous phase composed of water and optionally a freeze/thaw agent, one or more emulsifiers, or combinations thereof, and a water-immiscible phase composed of a hydrophobic pesticide and one or more emulsifiers.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, a pesticidal formulation of a hydrophobic pesticide is provided, which comprises the aforementioned aqueous formulation in combination with one or more additional pesticides.<br>
Also provided in accordance with the present invention are processes for making the aforementioned aqueous emulsions (EW) or pesticidal formulations of the aforementioned aqueous formulation in combination with one or more additional pesticides.<br>

insecticides, acaricides, fungicides, nematicides, ectoparasiticides, and growth regulators, either used to encourage growth of a desired plant species or retard growth of an undesired pest.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Generally, the present invention relates to aqueous formulations of a hydrophobic pesticide comprising emulsifying an aqueous phase and a water-immiscible phase to form the formulation; wherein water-immiscible phase comprises the pesticide and one or more suitable emulsifiers. Preferably, the aqueous phase includes a suitable freeze/thaw agent or one or more suitable emulsifiers, or a combination thereof. Examples of<br><br>
hydrophobic pesticides that can be used in the present invention include, but are not limited to, carfentrazone-ethyl, sulfentrazone.clomazone, perrrfethrin, zetacypermethrin, and bifenthrin. A preferred hydrophobic pesticide formulated by the present invention is carfentrazone-ethyl.<br>
The formulations of the present invention are believed to prevent or retard hydrolysis of the pesticide. As such, they exhibit equivalent, if not greater, stability than formulations disclosed in the art. In addition, the formulations of the present invention provide a homogeneous dispersion of the hydrophobic pesticide throughout the formulation.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the aqueous phase is added to the water-immiscible phase. That is to say, the formulation is prepared by the following steps:<br>
a)	providing the aqueous phase comprised of water;<br>
b)	providing the water-immiscible phase containing the hydrophobic pesticide and one or more emulsifiers;<br>
c)	adding the aqueous phase to the water-immiscible phase; and,<br>
d)	emulsifying the resulting mixture to form the formulation.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the water-immiscible phase is added to the aqueous phase. That is to say, the formulation is prepared by the following steps:<br>
e)	providing the water-immiscible phase containing the hydrophobic pesticide and one or more emulsifiers;<br>
f)	providing the aqueous phase comprised of water;<br>
g)	adding the water-immiscible phase to the aqueous phase; and<br>
h) emulsifying the resulting mixture to form the formulation.<br>
The emulsification is preferably carried out at a temperature in the range of about 20° C to about 80° C, more preferably from about 20° C to about 70° C. Preferably the emulsification is carried out for a period of in excess of about three minutes; and in one embodiment for a period of up to about 24 hours; more preferably from about five minutes to about three hours. The emulsification may be carried out at lower temperatures, such as, for example below 15° C, but generally will require an appreciably<br><br>
longer time to complete.<br>
Suitable emulsifiers that may be used in the context of the present invention are those substances that are active at an oil and water interface and which serve to reduce the surface tension of an oil thus allowing for the formation of a stable and homogeneous mixture. Examples of emulsifiers that can be used include, but are not limited to, carboxylates, sulphates, sulphonates, alcohol ethoxylates, alky) phenol ethoxylates, fatty acid ethoxylates, sorbitan esters, ethoxylated fats or oils, amine ethoxylates, phosphate esters, ethylene oxide - propylene oxide copolymers, fluorocarbons, and silicon polymers. Preferred emulsifiers that can be used are an alkyd-polyethylene glycol resin, a polyalkylene glycol ether, a polyalkoxylated nonyl phenyl, an alkoxylated primary alcohol, an ethoxylated distyrylphenol, an ethoxylated distyrylphenol sulphate, an ethoxylated tristyrylphenol phosphate, a tristyrylphenol phosphate ester, a hydroxylated stearic acid polyalkylene glycol polymer, and their corresponding salts. Particularly preferred emulsifiers that can be used in the present invention are an alkyd-polyethylene glycol resin, a polyalkylene glycol ether, an ethoxylated distyrylphenol, an ethoxylated distyrylphenol sulphate, an ethoxylated tristyrylphenol phosphate, a tristyrylphenol phosphate ester, and a tristyrylphenol phosphate potassium salt.<br>
, In yet another embodiment of thepresent invention, the aqueous phase can contain a freeze/thaw agent and one or more emulsifiers. Examples of freeze/thaw agents, also referred to as cryoprotectants, that can be used in the present invention include, but are not limited to, monoethlyene glycol, propylene glycol, glycerol, urea, and inorganic salts. A preferred freeze/thaw agent used is propylene glycol.  The emulsifiers disclosed above may also be included in the aqueous phase. A preferred emulsifier employed in the aqueous phase is an ethylene oxide - propylene oxide copolymer.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the water-immiscible phase can also contain a hydrocarbon solvent. Suitable hydrocarbon<br><br>
solvents are those liquids in which the water-immiscible phase may be miscible. Examples of hydrocarbon solvents that can be used in the present invention, include but are not limited to, alkylated naphthalene aromatics, alkylated biphenyls, hydrogenated aliphates, isoparaffins, paraffins, cycloparaffins, xylene range aromatics, alkyl acetates, fatty acids, esters, mineral and vegetable oils, and olefins. Preferred hydrocarbon solvents that can be used in the present invention are alkylated naphthalene aromatics and alkylated biphenyls.<br>
A typical recipe according to the present invention will ordinarily<br>
contain from about 1 to about 50, preferably about 2 to about 30, weight<br>
percent of the pesticide, from about 10 to about 25, preferably about 5 to<br>
about 10, total weight percent of one or more emulsifiers, and from about<br>
30 to about 80, preferably about 30 to about 75, weight percent of water.<br>
An alternative preferred embodiment of the present invention contains<br>
about 2 to about 15, preferably about 4 to about 10, weight percent of a<br>
freeze/thaw agent in addition to the aforementioned typical recipe. A<br>
further preferred alternative embodiment further contains about 1 to about<br>
50, preferably about 4 to about 25, weight percent of a hydrocarbon solvent<br>
in addition to the aforementioned typical recipe. Yet another preferred<br>
embodiment combines the aforementioned typical recipe, the freeze/thaw<br>
agent; and.the hydrocarbon solvent, each in the aforemenfoned<br>
concentrations. One further preferred embodiment is a formulation that<br>
contains the aforementioned ingredients of the typical recipe, with or<br>
without the freeze/thaw agent, with or without the hydrocarbon solvent, plus<br>
any other suitable ingredient, such as, without limitation, a second<br>
pesticide, a biocide, a thickening agent, and like ingredients commonly<br>
found in pesticidai formulations known in the art, many of which are set<br>
forth herein below.	.<br>
Once formulated, the average size of the particles of the pesticides generally is from about 0.01 urn to about 100 urn, preferably from about 0.01 urn to about 10 urn. The operating conditions to yield particles of a desired size will depend on a variety of factors, including, where applicable,<br><br>
the temperature at which the emulsification is performed, the addition rate of the reactants, the emulsifying equipment used, the amount of emulsifiers used, and the like. For example, a smaller particle size generally results when more emulsifiers are used and longer emulsifying time is used. In light of the present specification, adjustment to determine the proper conditions to achieve emulsions within the scope of the present invention is well within the skill of the art.<br>
After completion of the emulsification step, additional additives may be added to the formulations. The amounts of post emulsification additives to be added are similar for all embodiments and typically would be selected from one or more of about 0.003 to about 1, preferably about 0.005 to about 0.5, weight percent of an antifoam agent, such as a polydimethyl siloxane; about 0.003 to about 1, preferably about 0.005 to about 0.5, weight percent of a thickener, such as a xantham gum or ethyl or methyl cellulose; about 0.01 to about 0.5, preferably about 0.01 to about 0.1, weight percent of one or more bactericides; up to about 0.05, preferably up to about 0.04, weight percent of an inert dye; and up to about 10 weight percent of one or more surfactants, each weight percent relative to the weight of the formulation after addition of the additives.<br>
The formulations of the present invention can be used alone', or a<br>
»<br>
pesticidally effective amount of the formulation, for example, from about 2   ~"~: to about 50 weight percent, can be combined with a pesticidally effective amount, for example, from 50 to 98 weight percent, of one or more additional pesticides to provide a broader spectrum of activity than conventional formulations containing only a single pesticide. Examples of additional pesticides that are useful in the present invention include, but are not limited to, glyphosate, (2,4-dichlorophenoxyjacetic acid (2,4-D), (4-chloro-2-methylphenoxy)acetic acid (MCPA), (RS)-2-(4-chloro-o-tolyloxy)propionic acid (MCPP), isoproturon, imazapyr, imazamethabenz, imazethapyr, imazaquin, acifluorfen, bifenox, fomasafen, ioxynil, bromoxynil, chlorimuron, chlorsulfuron, bensulfuron, pyrazosulfuron, thifensulfuron, triasulfuron, fenoxaprop, fluazifop, quizaldfop, diclofop,<br><br>

After this time, the above-prepared aqueous antifoam agent solution was added using a Silverson L4RT mixer (available from Silverson-Machine LTD England). The resulting mixture was cooled to 30-40° C and mixed for eighteen minutes at 3000-7000 rpm to yield the emulsion. At the conclusion of this period, the mixture was stirred for one hour at 300 rpm to yield the emulsion.<br>
Example 11<br>
This example illustrates one protocol for the preparation of a 100 grams/liter emulsion (240 EW) formulation (Formulation L).<br>
A stirred mixture of 128.4 grams of bifenthrin and 447.6 grams of an alkylated naphthalene aromatic solvent (Aromatic 200 ND) was heated to 50° C to effect dissolution. In a separate mixing vessel, a mixture of 443.4<br><br><br>
grams of water, 60 grams of a polyalkylene glycol ether (Atlas G-5000), 0.6 gram of an antimicrobial biocide (Legend MK™), and 72 grams of propylene glycol was mixed for ten minutes using a Silverson L4RT mixer. After this time, the above-prepared bifenthrin solution was added during a five-minute period at 5600 rpm using a Silverson L4RT mixer. The resulting mixture was mixed for twenty minutes. At the conclusion of this period, 48 grams of an alkyd-polyethylene glycol resin (Atlox® 4914) was added over a five-minute period at 3600 rpm using a Silverson L4RT mixer. Upon completion of addition, the mixture was mixed and allowed to cool to ambient temperature to yield the emulsion.<br>
Example 12 Stability Studies<br>
This example sets forth stability studies that were accomplished on formulations prepared in accordance with the present invention.<br>
Laboratory tests that show the stability of the emulsion (EW) formulations were carried out in the following manner. Prior to commencing the stability tests, an initial percentage of active ingredient (carfentrazone-ethyl) present in Formulations C, E, and F prepared above was determined by chromatographic techniques. After this determination, the formulations were stored at 54° C for periods of two weeks, one month, and three months. After each of these periods, the percentage of active ingredient present in the formulation was determined by the same chromatographic technique.  The results of these tests are presented in Table 1 below.<br><br><br><br>
The results, shown in Table 1, indicate that the EW formulations of the present invention maintained their stability at elevated temperature.<br>
