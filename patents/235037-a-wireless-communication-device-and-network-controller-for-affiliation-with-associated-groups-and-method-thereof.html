A WIRELESS COMMUNICATION DEVICE AND NETWORK<br>
CONTROLLER FOR AFFILIATION WITH ASSOCIATED GROUPS<br>
AND METHOD THEREOF<br>
5<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates in general to communication systems, and more<br>
specifically to a method and apparatus for affiliation with associated groups by<br>
a wireless communication device.<br>
10<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
There currently exist in the market wireless communication devices<br>
capable of "instant communication" between devices without requiring dialing<br>
the phone number of the other wireless communication device. An example of<br>
15 this is the Nextel™ system in the United States and iDEN™ wireless<br>
communication devices from Motorola™. In such devices, it is possible to<br>
arrange a number of users into a unit or group for ease of operation in using the<br>
instant communication feature. When the wireless communication device is a<br>
member of a particular group it is said to be "associated" with that group. A<br>
20 wireless communication device may be associated with one or more groups.<br>
When the wireless communication device is programmed to operate within one<br><br>
WO 2004/080090	PCT/US2004/004101<br>
2<br>
of its associated groups, that is, to be able to select a user from that group and<br>
commence instant communication, the wireless communication device is said to<br>
be "affiliated" with that group. Currently, with one exception noted below, the<br>
wireless communication device may only be affiliated with one group with<br>
5 which it is associated. In addition, in the example of the Nextel system, the<br>
user of a wireless communication device with group communication capability<br>
has no formal way of knowing what groups the wireless communication device<br>
belongs to, leaving that to word of mouth and other informal means. The<br>
exception to single group affiliations mentioned above is the case in some<br>
10 utility-oriented applications where a 'super group' may be configured by a<br>
system operator where the super group is a joining of one or more existing<br>
groups. Similar to the above case, however, the wireless communication device<br>
may only be affiliated with one of these super groups at a time and only if<br>
previously configured by the system operator.<br>
15	Clearly a need exists for a method and apparatus for improved affiliation<br>
with associated groups.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
In overview, the present disclosure concerns wireless communication<br>
devices and a network controller that provide group communication service and<br>
5 more particularly such service to a user thereof. More particularly various<br>
inventive concepts and principles embodied in the methods and apparatus for<br>
the selection of groups and rules associated with the selection are discussed.<br>
The wireless communication devices and network controllers of particular<br>
interest are those constructed to allow users to communicate in a mode<br>
10 commonly known as "instant communication" or sometimes referred to as<br>
"walkie-talkie mode." When so enabled, the wireless communication device<br>
can be used to select another particular wireless communication device, and<br>
thereby its user, and press a "talk" button. Communication with the selected<br>
particular wireless communication device may then commence without the need<br>
15 for dialing a telephone number, but rather by simply pressing the talk button to<br>
talk and releasing it to listen. A concept of "group call" may also be supported<br>
whereby a user of the wireless communication device may simultaneously<br>
communicate with multiple users as a group. The wireless communication<br>
device of the user may belong to more than one group.<br>
20	While the concept of the group used in connection with the instant<br>
communication feature offers a convenience to the user, the need to shift<br>
between groups limits its usefulness. There are situations where the user of the<br>
wireless communication device may need or desire to have instant<br><br>
WO 2004/080090	PCT/US2004/004101<br>
5<br>
communication with members of separate groups. This might be the ease when<br>
on a job site and the need to be in touch with a co-worker on one group is high<br>
but when a family situation requires that communication be maintained with a<br>
family member whose wireless communication device belongs to a second<br>
5 group. Another purpose for communicating with multiple groups would be to<br>
allow a work group to exist in smaller, more efficient units, but when required<br>
for a large project or emergency situation, the work group could be easily united<br>
with another work group or work groups, allowing for more efficient operation.<br>
As further discussed below, various inventive principals and combinations<br>
10 thereof are advantageously employed to allow the user of the wireless<br>
communication device greater flexibility in both discovering available groups<br>
and selecting from those groups to enable multiple group communication.<br>
The instant disclosure is provided to further explain in an enabling fashion<br>
the best modes of making and using various embodiments in accordance with<br>
15 the present invention. The disclosure is further offered to enhance an<br>
understanding and appreciation for the inventive principles and advantages<br>
thereof, rather than to limit in any manner the invention. The invention is<br>
defined solely by the appended claims including any amendments made during<br>
the pendency of this application and all equivalents of those claims as issued.<br>
20	It is further understood that the use of relational terms, if any, such as<br>
first and second, top and bottom, and the like are used solely to distinguish one<br>
from another entity or action without necessarily requiring or implying any<br>
actual such relationship or order between such entities or actions.<br><br>
WO 2004/080090	PCT/US2004/004101<br>
6<br>
Much, of the inventive functionality and many of the inventive principles •<br>
are best implemented with or in software programs or instructions and<br>
integrated circuits (ICs) such as application specific ICs. It is expected that one<br>
of ordinary skill, notwithstanding possibly significant effort and many design<br>
5 choices motivated by, for example, available time, current technology, and<br>
economic considerations, when guided by the concepts and principles disclosed<br>
herein will be readily capable of generating such software instructions and<br>
programs and ICs with minimal experimentation. Therefore, in the interest of<br>
brevity and minimization of any risk of obscuring fee principles and concepts in<br>
10 accordance to the present invention, further discussion of such software and<br>
ICs, if any, will be limited to the essentials with respect to the principles and<br>
concepts of the preferred embodiments.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, a simplified and representative form of a block<br>
diagram of a communications system supporting group communication is<br>
15 discussed. A wireless communication device 100 is designed and constructed<br>
to support group communications. The wireless communication device 100 is<br>
operable to communicate wirelessly to a network infrastructure 102 managed in<br>
some part by a network controller 104. The wireless communication device<br>
100 is shown in this example as a member of a first group A 106 comprising a<br>
20 plurality of members as shown in a representative case by group A membership<br>
108, for example persons from work team. The wireless communication device<br>
100 is shown as also being a member of a second group, group B 110<br>
comprising a plurality of members as shown in a representative case by group B<br><br>
WO 2004/080090	PCT/US2004/004101<br>
7<br>
membership 112, for example persons from an immediate family. The wireless<br>
communication device 100 is depicted as the only mutual member of the two<br>
groups, but this is not a necessary condition. The wireless communication<br>
device 100 corresponds to the label "Owner*' in group A membership 108 and<br>
5 group B membership 112.<br>
All groups of which the wireless communication device 100 is a member<br>
are called the associated groups for the wireless communication device. The<br>
portion of groups to which the wireless communication device 100 is actually<br>
enabled for instant communication at any given time are called the affiliated<br>
10 groups for the wireless communication device. Note that the terms 'associated<br>
groups' and 'affiliated groups' are used frequently in the following descriptions<br>
and claims and are always used in the context as defined above.<br>
The wireless communication device 100 is similar in form and function to<br>
any of a number of commercial devices such as a Motorola model i95, further<br>
15 enhanced by the current invention. The network infrastructure 102 is a<br>
commercially available wireless communication network, as might be<br>
exemplified by a Motorola iDEN network as sold to and deployed by the Nextel<br>
Corporation, further enhanced by the current invention. The network controller<br>
104, a consitituent part of the network infrastructure, may be any of a number of<br>
20 commercially available servers, such as a Sun Microsystems™ server running<br>
the Solaris operating system comprising volatile and non-volatile memory and<br>
further programmed to incorporate the current invention.<br><br>
WO 2004/080090	PCT/US2004/004101<br>
8<br>
Referring to FIG.2, a block diagram of a wireless communication device<br>
200 arranged and constructed to request group affiliation will be discussed and<br>
described. The wireless communication device includes a controller 202 that is<br>
known and typically comprised of a one or more microprocessors and digital<br>
5 signal processors available from various manufacturers such as Motorola. The<br>
controller 202 is coupled to and controls both a receiver 204 and transmitter 206<br>
that operate as controlled by the controller 202 to receive and transmit various<br>
messages, including control messages such as channel allocation and group<br>
information and traffic messages such as voice messages or text messages.<br>
10	The controller 202 is also shown coupled to a memory 208. The memory<br>
in addition to including program memory 210, often in the form of object code<br>
that is executed by the controller to perform general control of the wireless<br>
communication device as well as user interface functions related to keypad and<br>
display operation, includes various databases and lists including group lists 212<br>
15 and wireless communication device configuration 214 information.<br>
The controller 202 is further coupled to a user interface 216 including a<br>
keypad 218, display 220, and audio circuitry 222. All the elements of the user<br>
interface 216 are typical of a cellular telephone and are commonly available.<br>
In operation, when indicated by a user that a change in group affiliation is<br>
20 requested the controller 202 will retrieve from the group list memory 212 a list<br>
of groups with which the wireless communication device 200 is currently<br>
known to be associated. The list of associated groups is displayed and the user<br>
of the wireless communication device is able to select from the list to create a<br><br>
WO 2004/080090	PCT/US2004/004101<br>
9<br>
list of requested affiliation groups. In the representative case being used for<br>
illustration, there may be three categories of a associated groups: mandatory or<br>
compulsory groups, optional groups and automatic or preset groups. Mandatory<br>
or compulsory groups are those that are required for affiliation. This may be the<br>
5 case wherein the wireless communication device 200 is actually owned by a<br>
corporation and expects the user thereof to always have an affilation with one or<br>
more work associated groups. Optional groups are those mat the user may<br>
choose to affiliate with and are not otherwise included unless requested.<br>
Automatic or preset groups are those which will be included unless they are<br>
10 specifically excluded by the user at the time the list of requested affiliation<br>
groups is created. This may be the case when a user is so likely to affiliate with<br>
a given group on an ongoing basis that the selection is made automatic or<br>
preset, such as a home or family group.<br>
The controller 202 may act to limit the number of selections that the user<br>
15 may pick, based on criteria such as but not limited to, the grade of service the<br>
wireless communication device is subscribed to or the model of wireless<br>
communication device. An exemplary process for selecting the list of<br>
requested affiliation groups from the list of associated groups is covered in more<br>
detail in the discussion of FIG. 4.<br>
20 .	The controller 202, being coupled to the transmitter 206 is able to send the<br>
list of requested affiliation groups to a network controller 104. The list of<br>
requested affiliation groups is processed at the network controller 104, as<br>
described hi greater detail in the discussion of FIG. 3, resulting in a list of<br><br>
WO 2004/080090	PCTYUS2004/004101<br>
10<br>
affiliated groups. The wireless communication device 200 will be configured in<br>
the network infrastructure 102 by the network controller 104 to allow instant<br>
and group communication with the groups as affiliated. The network controller<br>
104 may send the list of affiliated groups to the wireless communication device<br>
5 200, via the receiver 204. The controller 202 may then use the list to configure<br>
the wireless communication device for operation using the list of affiliated<br>
groups particularly, but not limited to, the display of the new configuration of<br>
affiliated groups when selections are made for instant communication with<br>
individuals and for group communication. The list of affilated groups may<br>
10 contain as d escribed above manditory or compulsory groups, optional groups<br>
and those automatic or preset groups which were not specifically excluded.<br>
The network controller 104 may include in the list of affiliated groups further<br>
information by way of a descriptive message, wherein the descriptive message<br>
comprises information regarding a difference between the list of a affiliated<br>
15 groups and the list of requested affiliation groups. Differences between the lists<br>
may be the result of the application of rules at the network controller 104 with<br>
respect to mandatory or compulsory groups, automatic or preset groups and any<br>
further limits in the number of allowable affiliation groups that may be applied<br>
by the network controller. The controller 202, by storing such information in<br>
20 the memory 208, in conjunction with the user interface 216 is able to display<br>
not only the list of associated groups as described above, but also such<br>
information regarding group affiliation as may be of interest to the user,<br><br>
WO 2004/080090	PCT/US2004/004101<br>
11<br>
including but not limited to the list of requested affiliation groups, the list of<br>
affilated groups and the descriptive message.<br>
It is likely in some exemplary embodiments that the controller 202 would<br>
be required to configure more than the display of the list to effect the new list of<br>
5 affiliated groups. In mis case, it may be beneficial for the controller 202 when a<br>
new list of affilated groups is received to not simply disaffiliate all groups<br>
before installing the new list, but to check for changes from the current<br>
configuration and only implement the changes. This may reduce the time<br>
required for such reconfiguration and may reduce or eliminate the time that the<br>
10 wireless communication device is not available for incoming and outgoing<br>
group call activity.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment with respect to the list of associated groups<br>
it is envisioned that the wireless communication device 200 would be operable<br>
to receive the list of associated groups over the air from the network controller<br>
15 104 or an authenticated source. The list of associated groups may also be<br>
created on the wireless communication device 200 itself using the user interface<br>
216 under the direction of the controller 202. This process for instantiating the<br>
list of associated groups either manually or wirelessly often referred to as<br>
discovery.<br>
20	Referring to FIG. 3, a block diagram of a network controller in<br>
accordance with the current invention is discussed and described. The network<br>
controller 300 is arranged and constructed for supporting group affiliations of<br>
wireless communication devices and is comprised of a processor 302 coupled to<br><br>
WO 2004/080090	PCT/US2004/004101<br>
12<br>
both a receiver 304 and transmitter 306 suitable for sending and receiving<br>
messages with the wireless communication device 200. The transmitter and<br>
receiver may be part of the larger infrastructure of the network infrastructure<br>
102 and may be further coupled to other elements of the network infrastructure<br>
5 102 such as a switch, routers, billing systems and the like. The processor 302 is<br>
further coupled to a memory 308. The memory includes group lists 310, where<br>
lists of associated and affiliated groups are stored, as well as membership<br>
information for the individual wireless communication device 200 memberships<br>
in those associated groups. The memory 308 also includes program memory<br>
10 312 wherein object code for operating the network controller resides. The<br>
object code in the program memory is responsible for, among other things,<br>
application of rules in the creation of a list of affiliated, groups and instructions<br>
on how to accomplish reconfiguration of the network infrastructure 102 to<br>
accommodate the list of affiliated groups after creation. The memory 308 also<br>
15 includes rules 314 which are applied in the processing of a list of requested<br>
affiliations to create a list of affiliations. The rules 314 may include information<br>
regarding application of mandatory or compulsory groups, automatic or preset<br>
groups and limits on the number of groups allowed. The memory 308 may also<br>
include memory 316 for storing information regarding configuration of the<br>
20 wireless communication device with respect to current affiliations. This may be<br>
helpful in determining what changes are being requested over the current<br>
configuration of associated groups.<br><br>
WO 2004/080090	PCT/US2004/004101<br>
13<br>
A list of requested affiliation groups is received from a wireless<br>
communication device 200. The processor 302 may apply the rules 314 to<br>
determine the final composition of the list of affiliated groups. An exemplary<br>
application of rules in this manner is covered in detail in the discussion of FIG.<br>
5 5.<br>
The processor 302 is further operable to configure the wireless<br>
communication device 200 as a member of the groups according to the list of<br>
affiliated groups thereby insuring that the wireless communication device has an<br>
opportunity to participate in group communication according to the list of<br>
10 affiliated groups, for example, setting the network infrastructure 102 to allow<br>
the wireless communication device 200 to initiate instant communication with a<br>
wireless communication device that is a member of any of the groups in the list<br>
of affiliated groups. In the configuration process, the processor 302 adds and<br>
removes affiliations as requested, to configure the wireless communication<br>
15 device as a member of the groups according to the list of affiliated groups. The<br>
configuration process may be done any of several ways, including but not<br>
limited to removing all current affiliations before configuring to the newly<br>
created list of affiliation groups, changing only the groups affected, as in<br>
disaffiliating the groups no longer to be included and adding groups to be newly<br>
20 affiliated, while leaving unchanged those that are configured before and after<br>
the updated list of affiliated groups is applied.<br><br>
WO 2004/080090	PCT/US2004/004101<br>
14<br>
The processor 3 02 is then able, via the transmitter, to send the list of<br>
affiliated groups to the wireless communication device 200 which may use the<br>
information as discussed above.<br>
The processor 302, in the application of the rules to develop the list of<br>
5 affiliated groups from the list of requested affiliation groups may create a<br>
descriptive message comprising information regarding any differences between<br>
the lists. An exemplary depiction of such a list is shown and discussed further<br>
in the discussion of FIG. 6. If a descriptive list is created, it may be provided to<br>
the wireless communication device 200 via the transmitter for use as described<br>
10 above and may be part of the list of affiliated groups or sent as a separate<br>
message.<br>
An additional capability of the network controller 300 under the<br>
direction of the processor 302 is to send via the transmitter 306 a list of the<br>
groups to which the wireless communication device 200 is currently configured<br>
15 as a member. This list may be used by the wireless communication device 200<br>
to inform the user of the wireless communication device about the groups to<br>
which membership applies, particularly as relates to the s election p rocess for<br>
creating the list of requested affiliation groups, as described above.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4 a depiction of a group selection process 400 on a<br>
20 wireless communication device in accordance with the current invention is<br>
discussed and described. The wireless communication device 200 obtains a list<br>
of associated groups 402, either wirelessly from the network controller 300 or<br>
via the user interface 216 when entered by a user. In the example shown the list<br><br><br>
WO 2004/080090	PCT/US2004/004101<br>
15<br>
of associated groups 402 has five entries representing various groups to which<br>
the wireless communication device 200 belongs as a member. Through a<br>
selection process, which may involve the user interface 216 in an interactive<br>
manner, a list of requested affiliation groups 404 is created. In the exemplary<br>
5 case shown, the user has selected the groups 'Home' at position 1 and<br>
'Bowling' at position 2. The user has specifically excluded the group<br>
'Customers' designated in this example, by 'X-Customer' in position 3. The<br>
dashed lines (	) of position 4 indicate that the selection of groups into the<br>
list of requested affiliation groups 404 is limited to 3.<br>
10	Referring to FIG. 5 a depiction of the application of rules for creation of<br>
a list of affiliated devices in accordance with the current invention is discussed<br>
and described. A list of associated groups 500 is present on a wireless<br>
communication device 200. A group selection process 502 is applied to create a<br>
list of requested affiliation groups 504. The list of requested affiliation groups<br>
15 is sent 506 to a network controller 300. The list of affiliated devices 508 is<br>
created by the application of rules in the following manner in this exemplary<br>
and representative case. A list of mandatory or compulsory groups 510 is<br>
consulted and found to contain one group, Work, which must be included 512 in<br>
the list of affiliated devices 508, thereby accounting for item 1 of the list to be<br>
20 Work. Following next, the list of requested groups 504 is consulted and the<br>
group Home is included 514 and the group Bowling is included 516. The list of<br>
automatic or preset groups 518 is consulted and the group Friends is included<br>
520. When the group Customers is attempted to be added 522 it is overridden<br><br>
WO 2004/080090	PCT/US2004/004101<br>
16<br>
by the specific exclusion of Customers 524 as noted from the list of requested<br>
affiliations 504. Customers is therefore not included in the list of affiliated<br>
groups 508. Lastly, in this example case, a check of any limit on the number of<br>
allowable groups is made and found to be set at five, denoted by the dashed line<br>
5 (	) in position 6. The limit has not been exceeded in this case and the final<br>
list of four stands as 1. Work, 2. Home, 3. Bowling, 4. Friends. This case of<br>
rules application in the creation of the list of affiliated groups is purely for<br>
explanatory purposes. It is expected that other sequences for and specific<br>
application of rules as well as other sets rules themselves would be applicable in<br>
10 other embodiments.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6 a simplified and representative form of a descriptive<br>
list related to the list of affiliated groups is discussed and described. The<br>
application of rules as discussed in the description of FIG. 5 resulted in a list of<br>
affiliated groups 508. The descriptive list 600 related to the creation of the list<br>
15 of affiliated groups 508 may be created in conjunction with that creation<br>
process. In this exemplary case, a reason for inclusion of each group on the list<br>
is given and a reason for exclusion of a group which may have been expected to<br>
have been included is shown. Also in this exemplary case, a limit of five<br>
groups is shown as designated by the dashed lines at position 6.<br>
20	Referring to FIG. 7 a simplified and representative form of a flow jchart<br>
for a wireless communication device in accordance with the current invention is<br>
discussed and described. A wireless communication device 200 is powered on,<br>
is registered with a network infrastructure 102 and is in normal operation 700<br><br>
WO 2004/080090	PCT/US2004/004101<br>
17<br>
and may be configured to support a current list of affiliated groups. A list of<br>
groups is received 702 and the list is tested 704 to determine whether the list is a<br>
list of affiliated groups or a list of associated groups. If a list of associated<br>
groups, the branch 'Associated' is followed from step 704. At the convenience<br>
5 of the user, for example, when a new set of affiliated groups is desired, the list<br>
of associated groups is displayed and a selection of a list of requested affiliation<br>
groups is created 706. The list is tested at 708 to determine if a limit to the<br>
number of selectable groups has been exceeded. If such a limit has been<br>
exceeded the user may be returned to step 706 following the Yes branch from<br>
10 708. If the limit has not been exceeded, the No branch from 708 is followed<br>
and the list of requested affiliation groups is sent 710 to the network controller<br>
300. Operation of the wireless communication device continues without<br>
change in affiliated groups at step 700 pending a response from the network<br>
controller.<br>
15	Upon receipt of a list at step 702, the list is again tested at 704 to<br>
determine the type of list. For the sake of example, the list is found to be a list<br>
of affiliated groups being a portion of the list of requested affiliation groups as<br>
described above, and the branch Affiliated from 704 is followed. The list is<br>
examined for content and the wireless communication device is configured for<br>
20 operation 712 using the list of affiliated groups. The wireless communication<br>
device is returned to operation 700, having been thus configured. Anytime<br>
following step 712, a user may display the current list of affiliated groups 714.<br>
An optional addition to the list of affiliated groups is a descriptive message. A<br><br>
WO 2004/080090	PCT/US2004/004101<br>
18<br>
test is made 716 to determine if the descriptive message is present. If so, the<br>
Yes branch from 716 is followed and the descriptive message may be displayed<br>
at step 718. Following step 718 the display may remain as shown or returned to<br>
a default display 720. If at step 716 it is determined that no descriptive message<br>
5 is present, the No branch from 716 is followed and the display may remain as<br>
shown or returned to a default display 720.<br>
The processes, apparatus, and methods, discussed above, and the<br>
inventive principles thereof are intended to and will alleviate problems<br>
associated with group affiliation. Using these principles of discovery, selection<br>
10 and affiliation of groups will both simplify and expand the usefulness of instant<br>
communication in wireless communication devices capable of such<br>
communication.<br>
The user of the wireless communication device is no longer required to<br>
have a priori knowledge of associated groups to be able to participate with<br>
15 them. Further, the prior art limit of a single group affiliation or single pre-<br>
selected set of groups is no longer a barrier to a user desiring to have the<br>
opportunity for instant communication with members of more than one group.<br>
Various embodiments of methods, systems, and apparatus for managing<br>
affiliation among associated groups so as to facilitate and provide for instant<br>
20 communication have been discussed and described. The disclosure extends to<br>
the constituent elements or equipment comprising such systems and specifically<br>
the methods employed thereby and therein. Using the inventive principles and<br>
concepts disclosed herein advantageously allows or provides for expanded<br><br>
WO 2004/080090	PCT/US2004/004101<br>
19<br>
capabilities in the selection of one or more affiliated groups from a list of<br>
associated groups, the use of rules for creation of the list of affiliated groups and<br>
expanded messages for users of wireless communication devices capable of<br>
supporting instant communication which will be beneficial to users and system<br>
5 providers alike.<br>
This disclosure is intended to explain how to fashion and use various<br>
embodiments in accordance with the invention rather than to limit the true,<br>
intended, and fair scope and spirit thereof. The foregoing description is not<br>
intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed.<br>
10 Modifications or variations are possible in light of the above teachings. The<br>
embodimen(s) was chosen and described to provide the best illustration of the<br>
principles of the invention and its practical application, and to enable one of<br>
ordinary skill in the art to utilize the invention in various embodiments and with<br>
various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated. All such<br>
15 modifications and variations are within the scope of the invention as determined<br>
by the appended claims, as may be amended during the pendency of this<br>
application for patent, and all equivalents thereof, when interpreted in<br>
accordance with the breadth to which they are fairly, legally, and equitably<br>
