3,4 -Di-SUBSTITUTED CYCL0BUTENE-1,2-DI0NES AS CXC CHEMOKINE RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to novel substituted cyclobutenedione compounds, pharmaceutical compositions containing the compounds, and the use of the compounds and compositions in treating CXC-chemokine-mediated diseases.<br>
Chemokines are chemotactic cytokines that are released by a wide variety of cells to attract macrophages, T-cells, eosinophils, basophils, neutrophils and endothelial cells to sites of inflammation and tumor growth. There are two main classes of chemokines, the CXC-chemokines and the CC- chemokines. The class depends on whether the first two cysteines are separated by a single amino acid (CXC-chemokines) or are adjacent (CC-chemokines). The CXC-chemokines include interleukin-8 (IL-8), neutrophil-activating protein-1 (NAP-1), neutrophil-activating protein-2 (NAP-2) GROa, GROp, GROy, ENA-78, IP-10, MIG and PF4. CC chemokines include RANTES, MIP -1a, MIP-20, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), MCP-2, MCP-3, GCP-2 and eotaxin. individual members of the chemokine families are known to be bound by at least one chemokine receptor, with CXC-chemokines generally bound by members of the CXCR class of receptors, and CC-chemokines by members of the CCR class of receptors. For example, IL-8 is bound by the CXCR-1 and CXCR-2 receptors.<br>
Since CXC-chemokines promote the accumulation and activation of neutrophils, these chemokines have been implicated in a wide range of acute and chronic inflammatory disorders including psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, Baggiolini etal.. FEBS Lett. 307, 97 (1992); Miller et al., Crit. Rev. Immunol. 12, 17(1992); Oppenheim et al., Annu. Fev. Immunol. 9, 617 (1991); Seitz et al., J. Clin. Invest. 87, 463 (1991); Miller et al., Am. Rev. Respir. Pis. 146, 427 (1992); Donnely et al., Lancet 341,643(1993).<br>
ELRCXC chemokines including IL-8, GROa, GROp, GROy, NAP-2, and ENA-78 (Strieter et al. 1995 JBC 270 p. 27348-57) have also been implicated in the induction of tumor angiogenesis (new blood vessel growth). All of these chemokines are believed to exert their actions by binding to the 7 transmembrane G-protein coupled receptor CXCR2 (also known as IL-8RB), while IL-8 also binds CXCR1 (also<br><br>
known as IL-8RA). Thus, their angiogenic activity is due to their binding to and activation of CXCR2, and possibly CXCR1 for IL-8, expressed on the surface of vascular endothelial cells (ECs) in surrounding vessels.<br>
Many different types of tumors have been shown to produce ELRCXC chemokines and their production has been correlated with a more aggressive phenotype (Inoue et al. 2000 Clin Cancer Res 6 p. 2104-2119) and poor prognosis (Yoneda et. al. 1998 J Nat Cancer Inst 90 p. 447-454). Chemokines are potent chemotactic factors and the ELRCXC chemokines have been shown to induce EC chemotaxis. Thus, these chemokines probably induce chemotaxis of endothelial cells toward their site of production in the tumor. This may be a critical step in the induction of angiogenesis by the tumor. Inhibitors of CXCR2 or dual inhibitors of CXCR2 and CXCR1 will inhibit the angiogenic activity of the ELRCXC chemokines and therefore block the growth of the tumor. This anti-tumor activity has been demonstrated for antibodies to IL-8 (Arenberg et al. 1996 J Clin Invest 97 p. 2792-2802), ENA-78 (Arenberg et al. 1998 J Clin Invest 102 p. 465-72), and GROa (Haghnegahdaret al. J. Leukoc Biology 2000 67 p. 53-62).<br>
Many tumor cells have also been shown to express CXCR2 and thus tumor cells may also stimulate their own growth when they secrete ELRCXC chemokines. Thus, along with decreasing angiogenesis, inhibitors of CXCR2 may directly inhibit the growth of tumor cells.<br>
Hence, the CXC-chemokine receptors represent promising targets for the development of novel anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor agents.<br>
There remains a need for compounds that are capable of modulating activity at CXC-chemokine receptors. For example, conditions associated with an increase in IL-8 production (which is responsible for chemotaxis of neutrophil and T-cell subsets into the inflammatory site and growth of tumors) would benefit by compounds that are inhibitors of IL-8 receptor binding.<br><br>

Compounds of formula (I) may be produced by processes known to those skilled in the art in the following reaction schemes and in the preparations and examples below.<br><br><br><br>
A general procedure for the preparation of compounds of formula I is as follows:<br>
Scheme 1<br>
An amine is condensed (Step A) with a nitrosalicylic acid under standard coupling conditions and the resulting nitrobenzamide is reduced (Step B) under hydrogen atmosphere in the presence of a suitable catalyst. The remaining partner required for the synthesis of the final target is prepared by condensing an aryl amine with the commercially available diethylsquarate to give the anilinoethoxysquarate product. Subsequent condensation of this intermediate with the aminobenzamide prepared earlier provides the desired chemokine antagonist (Scheme 1).<br>
Scheme 2<br>
Alternatively, the aminobenzamide of Scheme 1 is first condensed with commercially available diethylsquarate to give an alternate monoethoxy intermediate. Condensation of this intermediate with an aryl or heteroaryl amine gives the desired chemokine antagonist.<br>
Scheme 3<br><br><br><br>
Scheme 3<br>
Benztriazoie compounds of Formula (I) are prepared by stirring nitrophenylenediamines with sodium nitrite in acetic acid at 60°C to afford the nitrobenzotriazole intermediate (Scheme 3).  Reduction of the nitro group in the presence of palladium catalyst and hydrogen atmosphere provided the amine compound. Subsequent condensation of this intermediate with the anilinoethoxysquarate prepared earlier (Scheme 1) provides the desired chemokine antagonist.<br>
Scheme 4<br>
Condensation of nitrophenylenediamines with anhydrides or activated acids at reflux (Scheme 4) affords benzimidazole intermediates which after reduction with hydrogen gas and palladium catalyst and condensation with the anilinoethoxysquarate previously prepared (Scheme 1) affords benzimidazole chemokine antagonists.<br><br><br>
Scheme 5<br>
Indazole structures of Formula (I) can be prepared according to Scheme 5 by reduction of nitroindazole A {J. Am. Chem Soc. 1943, 65, 1804-1805) to give aminoindazole B and subsequent condensation with the aniiinoethoxysquarate prepared earlier (Scheme 1).<br>
Scheme 6<br>
Indole structures of Formula (I) can be prepared according to Scheme 6 by reduction of nitroindole A (J. Med. Chem. 1995, 38, 1942-1954) to give aminoindole B<br><br>
and subsequent condensation with the anilinoethoxysquarate prepared earlier (Scheme 1).<br>
BIOLOGICAL EXAMPLES<br>
The compounds of the present invention are useful in the treatment of CXC-chemokine mediated conditions and diseases. This utility is manifested in their ability to inhibit IL-8 and GRO-a chemokine as demonstrated by the following in vitro assays.<br>
Receptor Binding Assays:<br>
CXCR1 SPA Assay<br>
For each well of a 96 well plate, a reaction mixture of 10 jig hCXCR1-CHO overexpressing membranes (Biosignal) and 200 jag/well WGA-SPA beads (Amersham) in 100 jal was prepared in CXCR1 assay buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.8, 2mM CaCI2, 1mMMgCI2, 125 mM NaCI, 0.1% BSA) (Sigma). A 0.4 nM stock of ligand, [125l]-IL-8 (NEN) was prepared in the CXCR1 assay buffer.   20X stock solutions of test compounds were prepared in DMSO (Sigma). A 6 X stock solution of IL-8 (R&amp;D) was prepared in CXCR2 assay buffer. The above solutions were added to a 96-well assay plate (PerkinElmer) as follows: 10 \x\ test compound or DMSO, 40 \i\ CXCR1 assay buffer or IL-8 stock, 100 jil of reaction mixture, 50 ul of ligand stock (Final [Ligand] = 0.1 nM). The assay plates were shaken for 5 minutes on plate shaker, then incubated for 8 hours before cpm/well were determined in Microbeta Trilux counter (PerkinElmer).  % Inhibition of Total binding-NSB (250 nM IL-8) was determined for IC50 values.<br>
CXCR2 SPA Assay<br>
For each well of a 96 well plate, a reaction mixture of 4 jag hCXCR2-CHO overexpressing membranes (Biosignal) and 200 ng/well WGA-SPA beads (Amersham) in 100 \x\ was prepared in CXCR2 assay buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mM CaCI2, 1mM MgCI2). A 0.4 nM stock of ligand, [125IJ-IL-8 (NEN), was prepared in the CXCR2 assay buffer.   20X stock solutions of test compounds were prepared in DMSO (Sigma). A 6 X stock solution of GRO-a (R&amp;D) was prepared in CXCR2 assay buffer. The above solutions were added to a 96-well assay plate (PerkinElmer or Corning) as follows: 10 \i\ test compound or DMSO, 40 ul CXCR2 assay buffer or GRO- a stock, 100 jal of reaction mixture, 50 ul of ligand stock (Final [Ligand] =<br><br>
0.1 nM). When 40 X stock solutions of test compounds in DMSO were prepared, then the above protocol was used except instead 5 ul test compound or DMSO and 45 \i\ CXCR2 assay buffer were used. The assay plates were shaken for 5 minutes on a plate shaker, then incubated for 2-8 hours before cpm/well were determined in Microbeta Trilux counter (PerkinElmer).  % Inhibition of total binding minus non-specific binding (250 nM Gro-a or 50 uM antagonist) was determined and IC50 values calculated.<br>
Calcium Fluorescence Assay (FLIPR)<br>
HEK 293 cells stably transfected with hCXCR2 and Gcu/q were plated at 10,000 cells per well in a Poly-D-Lysine Black/Clear plate (Becton Dickinson) and incubated 48 hours at 5% CO-, 37°C. The cultures were then incubated with 4 mM fluo-4, AM (Molecular Probes) in Dye Loading Buffer (1% FBS, HBSS w. Ca &amp; Mg, 20 mM HEPES (Cellgro), Probenicid (Sigma)) for 1 hour. The cultures were washed with wash buffer (HBSS w Ca, &amp; Mg, 20 mM HEPES, Probenicid (2.5 mM)) three times, then 100 jal/well wash buffer was added.<br>
During incubation, compounds were prepared as 4X stocks in 0.4% DMSO (Sigma) and wash buffer and added to their respective wells in the first addition plate. IL-8 or GRO-a (R&amp;D Systems) concentrations were prepared 4X in wash buffer + 0.1% BSA and added to their respective wells in second addition plate.<br>
Culture plate and both addition plates were then placed in the FLIPR imaging system to determine change in calcium fluorescence upon addition of compound and then ligand. Briefly, 50 of compound solutions or DMSO solution was added to respective wells and change in calcium fluorescence measured by the FLIPR for 1 minute. After a 3 minute incubation within the instrument, 50 ^l of ligand was then added and the change in calcium fluorescence measured by the FLIPR instrument for I minute. The area under each stimulation curve was determined and values used to determine % Stimulation by compound (agonist) and % Inhibition of Total Calcium response to ligand (0.3 nM IL-8 or GRO-a) for IC50 values of the test compounds.<br><br>
Chemotaxis assays for293-CXCR2<br>

2.	The collagen is removed and inserts are allowed to air dry overnight.<br>
3.	Cells are labeled with 10uM calcein AM (Molecular Probes) for 2 hrs. Labeling is done in complete media with 2% FBS.<br>
4.	Dilutions of compound are made in minimal media (0.1% BSA) and placed inside the insert which is positioned inside the well of a 24 well plate. Within the well is IL-8 at a concentration of 0.25nM in minimal media. Cells are washed and resuspended in minimal media and placed inside the insert at a concentration of 50,000 cells per insert.<br>
5.	Plate is incubated for 2hrs and inserts are removed and placed in a new 24 well.  Fluorescence is detected at excitation=485 nM and emission=530 nM.<br>
Cytotoxicity Assays<br>
A cytotoxicity assay for CXCR2 compounds is conducted on 293-CXCR2 cells. Concentrations of compounds are tested for toxicity at high concentrations to determine if they may be used for further evaluation in binding and cell based assays. The protocol is as follows:<br>
1.	293-CXCR2 cells are plated overnight at a concentration of 5000 cells per well in complete media.<br>
2.	Dilutions of compound are made in minimal media w/0.1% BSA. Complete media is poured off and the dilutions of compound are added. Plates are incubated for 4, 24 and 48hrs. Cells are labeled with 10uM calcein AM for 15 minutes to determine cell viability. Detection method is the same as above.<br>
Soft Agar Assay<br>
10,000 SKMEL-5 cells/well are placed in a mixture of 1.2% agar and complete media with various dilutions of compound. Final concentration of agar is 0.6%. After 21 days viable cell colonies are stained with a solution of MTT (1mg/ml in PBS). Plates are then scanned to determine colony number and size. IC50 is determined by comparing total area vs. compound concentration.<br><br>
For the compounds of this invention,  a range of CXCR2 receptor binding # activities from about 1 nM to about 10,000 nM was observed.   Compounds of this invention preferably have a binding activity in the range of about 1 nM to 1,000 nM, more preferably about 1 to 500 nM, and most preferably about 1 nM to 100 nM.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions containing the active ingredient may be in a form suitable for oral use, for example, as tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, or syrups or elixirs. Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting of sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents in order to provide pharmaceutical elegant and palatable preparations.

The tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be employed. They may also be coated by the technique described in the U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,256,108; 4,166,452; and 4P265,874 to form osmotic therapeutic tablets for controlled release.<br>
Formulations for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredients is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or a soft gelatin capsules where in the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraffin or olive oil.<br>
Aqueous suspensions contain the active material in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients are suspending agents, for example, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth<br><br>
and gum acacia; dispersing or wetting agents may be a naturally-occurring phosphatide, for example, lecithin, or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids, for example polyoxyethylene stearate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for example, heptadecaethylene-oxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example, polyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The aqueous suspensions may also contain one or more preservatives, for example, ethyl or n-propyl, p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents, and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose, saccharin or aspartame.<br>
Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil, for example, arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for example, beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents such as those set forth above, and flavoring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid.<br>
Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional excipients, e.g., sweetening, flavoring and coloring agents, may also be present.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in the form of an oil-in-water emulsions. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, e.g., olive oil or arachis oil, or a mineral oil, e.g., liquid paraffin or mixtures of these. Suitable emulsifying agents may be naturally-occurring phosphatides, e.g., soy beans, lecithin, and esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example, sorbitan monooleate, and condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, e.g..polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The emulsions may also contain sweetening and flavouring agents.<br><br>
Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents, for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol or sucrose. Such formulations may also contain a demulcent, a preservative and flavoring and coloring agents.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, e.g.,as a solution in 1,3-butane diol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables.<br>
Compounds of the invention may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. The compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials are cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols.<br>
For topical use, creams, ointments, jellies, solutions or suspensions, etc., containing the compound of The invention are employed. (For purposes of this application, topical application shall include mouthwashes and gargles.)<br>
The compounds for the present invention can be administered in the intranasal form via topical use of suitable intranasal vehicles, or via transdermal routes, using those forms of transdermal skin patches well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. To be administered in the form of a transdermal delivery system, the dosage administration will, of course, be continuous rather than intermittent throughout the dosage regimen. Compounds of the present invention may also be delivered as a suppository employing bases such as cocoa butter, glycerinated gelatin, hydrogenated vegetable oils, mixtures of polyethyleme glycols of various molecular weights and fatty acid esters of polyethylene glycol.<br>
The dosage regimen utilizing the compounds of the present invention is selected in accordance with a variety of factors including type, species, weight, sex<br><br>
and medical condition of the patient; the severity of the condition to be treated; the route of administration; the renal and hepatic function of the patient; and the particular compound thereof employed. A physician or veterinarian of ordinary skill can readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of the drug required to prevent, counter, arrest or reverse the progress of the condition. Optimal precision in achieving concentration of drug within the range that yields efficacy without toxicity requires a regimen based on the kinetics of the drug's availability to target sites. This involves a consideration of the distribution, equilibrium, and elimination of a drug. Preferably, doses of the compound of structural The invention useful in the method of the present invention range from 0.01 to 1000 mg per adult human per day.  Most preferably, dosages range from 0.1 to 500 mg/day. For oral administration, the compositions are preferably provided in the form of tablets containing 0.01 to 1000 milligrams of the active ingredient, particularly 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0, 25.0, 50.0, 100 and 500 milligrams of the active ingredient for the symptomatic adjustment of the dosage to the patient to be treated. An effective amount of the drug is ordinarily supplied at a dosage level of from about 0.0002 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg of body weight per day. The range is more particularly from about 0.001 mg/kg to 1 mg/kg of body weight per day.<br>
Advantageously, the active agent of the present invention may be administered in a single daily dose, or the total daily dosage may be administered in dividend doses of two, three or four time daily.<br>
The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration.<br>
It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route or administration, rate of excretion, drug combination and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy.<br>

Methods for the safe and effective administration of most of these chemotherapeutic agents are known to those skilled in the art. In addition, their administration is described in the standard literature. For example, the administration of many of the chemotherapeutic agents is described in the "Physicians' Desk Reference" (PDR), e.g., 1996 edition (Medical Economics Company, Montvale, NJ 07645-1742, USA); the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference thereto.<br>
As used herein, a microtubule affecting agent is a compound that interferes with cellular mitosis, i.e., having an antimitotic effect, by affecting microtubule formation and/or action. Such agents can be, for instance, microtubule stabilizing agents or agents which disrupt microtubule formation.<br>
Microtubule affecting agents useful in the invention are well known to those of skill in the art and include, but are not limited to allocolchicine (NSC 406042), Halichondrin B (NSC 609395), colchicine (NSC 757), colchicine derivatives (e.g., NSC 33410), dolastatin 10 (NSC 376128), maytansine (NSC 153858), rhizoxin (NSC 332598), paclitaxel (Taxol®, NSC 125973), Taxol® derivatives (e.g., derivatives (e.g.f NSC 608832), thiocolchicine (NSC 361792), trityl cysteine (NSC 83265), vinblastine sulfate (NSC 49842), vincristine sulfate (NSC 67574), epothilone A, epothilone, and discodermolide {see Service, (1996) Science, 274:2009) estramustine, nocodazole, MAP4, and the like. Examples of such agents are also described in the scientific and patent literature, see, e.g., Bulinski (1997) J. Cell ScL 110:3055-3064; Panda (1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. ScL USA 94:10560-10564; Muhlradt (1997) Cancer Res. 57:3344-3346; Nicolaou (1997) Nature 387:268-272; Vasquez (1997) Mol. Biol. Cell. 8:973-985; Panda (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271:29807-29812.<br>
Particularly preferred agents are compounds with paclitaxel-iike activity. These include, but are not limited to paclitaxel and paclitaxel derivatives (paclitaxel-like compounds) and analogues. Paclitaxel and its derivatives gje available commercially. In addition, methods of making paclitaxel and paclitaxel derivatives and analogues are<br><br>
well known to those of skill in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos: 5,569,729; 5,565,478; 5,530,020; 5,527,924; 5,508,447; 5,489,589; 5,488,116; 5,484,809; 5,478,854; 5,478,736; 5,475,120; 5,468,769; 5,461,169; 5,440,057; 5,422,364; 5,411,984; 5,405,972; and 5,296,506).<br>
More specifically, the term "paclitaxel" as used herein refers to the drug commercially available as Taxol® (NSC number: 125973). Taxol® inhibits eukaryottc cell replication by enhancing polymerization of tubulin moieties into stabilized microtubule bundles that are unable to reorganize into the proper structures for mitosis. Of the many available chemotherapeutic drugs, paclitaxel has generated interest because of its efficacy in clinical trials against drug-refractory tumors, including ovarian and mammary gland tumors (Hawkins (1992) Oncology, 6: 17-23, Horwitz (1992) Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 13: 134-146, Rowinsky (1990) J. Natl. Cane. Inst. 82: 1247-1259).<br>
Additional microtubule affecting agents can be assessed using one of many such assays known in the art, e.g., a semiautomated assay which measures the tubulin-polymerizing activity of paclitaxel analogs in combination with a cellular assay to measure the potential of these compounds to block cells in mitosis (see Lopes (1997) Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 41:37-47).<br>
Generally, activity of a test compound is determined by contacting a cell with that compound and determining whether or not the cell cycle is disrupted, in particular, through the inhibition of a mitotic event. Such inhibition may be mediated by disruption of the mitotic apparatus, e.g., disruption of normal spindle formation. Cells in which mitosis is interrupted may be characterized by altered morphology (e.g., microtubule compaction, increased chromosome number, etc.).<br>
In a preferred embodiment, compounds with possible tubulin polymerization activity are screened in vitro.  In a preferred embodiment, the compounds are screened against cultured WR21 cells (derived from line 69-2 wap-ras mice) for inhibition of proliferation and/or for altered cellular morphology, in particular for microtubule compaction. In vivo screening of positive-testing compounds can then be performed using nude mice bearing the WR21 tumor cells. Detailed protocols for this screening method are described by Porter (1995) Lab. Anim. Sci., 45(2): 145-150.<br>
Other methods of screening compounds for desirecj activity are well known to those of skill in the art. Typically such assays involve assays for inhibition of<br><br>
microtubule assembly and/or disassembly. Assays for microtubule assembly are described, for example, byGaskin et at. (1974) J. Molec. Biol., 89: 737-758. U.S. Patent No. 5,569,720 also provides in vitro and in vivo assays for compounds with paclitaxel-like activity.<br>
Methods for the safe and effective administration of the above-mentioned microtubule affecting agents are known to those skilled in the art. In addition, their administration is described in the standard literature. For example, the administration of many of the chemotherapeutic agents is described in the "Physicians' Desk Reference" (PDR), e.g., 1996 edition (Medical Economics Company, Montvale, NJ 07645-1742, USA); the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference thereto.<br>
The amount and frequency of administration of the compounds of formula (I) and the chemotherapeutic agents and/or radiation therapy will be regulated according to the judgment of the attending clinician (physician) considering such factors as age, condition and size of the patient as well as severity of the disease being treated. A dosage regimen of the compound of formula (I) can be oral administration of from 10 mg to 2000 mg/day, preferably 10 to 1000 mg/day, more preferably 50 to 600 mg/day, in two to four (preferably two) divided doses, to block tumor growth. Intermittent therapy (e.g., one week out of three weeks or three out of four weeks) may also be used.<br>
The chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation therapy can be administered according to therapeutic protocols well known in the art. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the administration of the chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation therapy can be varied depending on the disease being treated and the known effects of the chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation therapy on that disease. Also, in accordance with the knowledge of the skilled clinician, the therapeutic protocols (e.g., dosage amounts and times of administration) can be varied in view of the observed effects of the administered therapeutic agents (i.e., antineoplastic agent or radiation) on the patient, and in view of the observed responses of the disease to th* administered therapeutic agents.<br>
In the methods of this invention, a compound of formula (I) is administered concurrently or sequentially with a chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation. Thus, it is not necessary that, for example, the chemotherapeutic agent and the compound of<br><br>
formula (I), or the radiation and the compound of formula (I), should be administered simultaneously or essentially simultaneously. The advantage of a simultaneous or essentially simultaneous administration is well within the determination of the skilled clinician.<br>
Also, in general, the compound of formula (I) and the chemotherapeutic agent do not have to be administered in the same pharmaceutical composition, and may, because of different physical and chemical characteristics, have to be administered by different routes. For example, the compound of formula (I) may be administered orally to generate and maintain good blood levels thereof, while the chemotherapeutic agent may be administered intravenously. The determination of the mode of administration and the advisability of administration, where possible, in the same pharmaceutical composition, is well within the knowledge of the skilled clinician.  The initial administration can be made according to established protocols known in the art, and then, based upon the observed effects, the dosage, modes of administration and times of administration can be modified by the skilled clinician .<br>
The particular choice of a compound of formula (I), and chemo-therapeutic agent and/or radiation will depend upon the diagnosis of the attending physicians and their judgement of the condition of the patient and the appropriate treatment protocol.<br>
The compound of formula (0, and chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation may be administered concurrently (e.g., simultaneously, essentially simultaneously or within the same treatment protocol) or sequentially, depending upon the nature of the proliferative disease, the condition of the patient, and the actual choice of chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation to be administered in conjunction (i.e., within a single treatment protocol) with the compound of formula (I).<br>
If the compound of formula £1), and the chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation are not administered simultaneously or essentially simultaneously, then the initial order of administration of the compound of formula (I), and the chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation, ma^not be important. Thus, the compound of formula (I) may be administered first followed by the administration of the chemotherapeutic agent and/or relation; or the chemo-therapeutic agent and/or radiation may be administered first followed by the administration of the compound of formula (I). This alternate administration may be repeated during a single treatment protocol. The determination of the order of administration, and the number of<br><br>
repetitions of administration of each therapeutic agent during a treatment protocol, is well within the knowledge of the skilled physician after evaluation of the disease being treated and the condition of the patient. For example, the chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation may be administered first, especially if it is a cytotoxic agent, and then the treatment continued with the administration of the compound of formula (I) followed, where determined advantageous, by the administration of the chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation, and so on until the treatment protocol is complete.<br>
Thus, in accordance with experience and knowledge, the practicing physician can modify each protocol for the administration of a component (therapeutic agent-/.e., the compound of formula (I), chemotherapeutic agent or radiation) of the treatment according to the individual patient's needs, as the treatment proceeds.<br>
The attending clinician, in judging whether treatment is effective at the dosage administered, will consider the general well-being of the patient as well as more definite signs such as relief of disease-related symptoms, inhibition of tumor growth, actual shrinkage of the tumor, or inhibition of metastasis. Size of the tumor can be measured by standard methods such as radio-logical studies, e.g., CAT or MRI scan, and successive measurements can be used to judge whether or not growth of the tumor has been retarded or even reversed.  Relief of disease-related symptoms such as pain, and improvement in overall condition can also be used to help judge effectiveness of treatment.<br>
The following examples illustrate the preparation of some of the compounds of the invention and are not to be construed as limiting the invention disclosed herein. Alternate mechanistic pathways and analogous structures will be apparent to those skilled in the art.<br>
