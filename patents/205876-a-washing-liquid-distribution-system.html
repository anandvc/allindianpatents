A WASHING LIQUID DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM<br>
OUTOKUMPU OYJ<br>
of Riihitontuntie 7, FIN-02200 Espoo, Finland a Finnish public limited Company<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE NATURE                      OF THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED:-<br><br>
A WASHING LIQUID DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM<br>
The present invention relates to a liquid distribution system for a plurality of surfaces using an adjustable liquid flow distributor. A preferred application for the present invention is the spiral separators industry.<br>
Washing liquid distribution systems are used in different industrial processes such as separating concentrating particles in slurry from lighter ones in a spiral separator. The use of water or liquid washing has been found to be desirable because it wili keep lighter particles washed off of the concentrating particles and will also assist in moving the heavier concentrates to their points of discharge in the spiral. The movement ot the concentrating particles without washing water would be quite slow or may even stop completely because they are in not only the slowest moving zone but are in a very shallow or narrow portion of the slurry.<br>
In the prior art, washing water or liquid is delivered through a spiraling pipe or launder trough. Typically, a spiral separator contains a water-carrying pipe with openings or a water channel that is adjacent to inner side of a trough surface in a spiral separator. A multitude of control valves control water flow from the pipe or water channel to the process trough. In a seven flights spiral separator, for example, a water carrying pipe may have seven to twenty openings and usually there is a control valve for each outlet.<br>
Another prior art system has a center column, which is used as a water reservoir, and individual valves control the amount of water supplied to each point of addition along the spiral. The pressure difference between the points of addition makes it difficult to control the flow. Additionally, the kinetic energy of water at the lowest point of addition due to the high pressure might be large enough to disturb the liquid flow around the last point oi addition.<br>
2<br><br>
of each passage will vary in proportion to the angle of tilting. Each passage distributes washing liquid adjacent an inner side of the trough surface. Varying the tilt angle produces proportional changes in the amount of washing liquid flowing in each trough surface of a flight. An operator can change the amount of liquid flowing into a particular flight. By changing the angle of tilt, the amount of liquid flowing through one passage to one flight varies, while the amount flowing from other passages to other flights varies in proportion to the change in the first one.<br>
If a large number of separators are needed, a liquid flow distributor may be disposed on iop of eacii separator. A main liquid supply provides liquid to all the distributors. This scheme enables an operator to control a liquid flow into each separator. Alternatively, one liquid flow distributor can be used for ail the separators. Both of those systems can be automated by adding a flow control mechanism to control flow from the liquid supply to a liquid distributor. Preferably, an on-stream analyzer is used to analyze composition of different samples of concentrate middlings and tailings drawn from the spirals. The analyzer signals analysis data to the control mechanism assisting the control mechanism in determining an appropriate amount of flow to the spirals.<br>
In further embodiment, a washing liquid distributor housing has a plurality of compartments disposed around a cylindrical center chamber. A cylindrical liquid flow controller has an upper slanted edge. The liquid flow controller is disposed inside the center chamber with the outer surface of controller being juxtaposed with the inner surface of chamber. Each of the compartments has a vertical passage fluidly connecting compartment to the center chamber. Also, each compartment has at least one outlet connected to at least one fluid passageway. The liquid flow controller receives liquid from a liquid supply. At any rotated position, the controller exposes and covers some areas or portions of passages to liquid flow. When the controller rotates to selected positions around its vertical central axis inside center chamber, changes in the areas covered and exposed to liquid flow are provided which changes amount of<br>
6<br><br>
water flowing through these passages to fluid passageways. Each passage in each compartment delivers liquid flow to fluid passageways, which are connected to different flights of a separator. Fluid passageways deliver washing liquid to a trough surface of the spiral separator. Consequently, rotation of the controller provides differing amounts of washing liquid to different flights in the separator. If an operator desires to increase or decrease the amount of washing liquid flowing into a separator, the operator simply rotates the controller to cause delivery of more or less amount of liquid. The amount of washing liquid flowing into other flights also will change but the changes will generally be in proportion to the change in flow desired by the operator. The controller upper edge may have different contours as may be required by different processes for separating different particles.<br>

FIGS. 13 A and B are practical alternative embodiments of the passages, which<br>
can be applied to the embodiments shown in FIGS. 1 and 9-12; and<br>
FIG. 13 C is a side view of FIG. 13B.<br>
The features and design details of the invention are best understood by reference to the attached drawings.<br>
FIG. 1 shows a washing liquid distributor housing 10 having a plurality of members or compartments 16 disposed around a cylindrical center chamber 12. A cylindrical liquid flow controller 14 is depicted having an upper slanted edge 22. The liquid flow controller 14 is disposed inside the center chamber 1k: with the outer surface of controller 14 being juxtaposed with the inner surface of chamber 12. Each of the compartments 16 has a vertical passage 20 fluidiy<br>
8<br><br>
connecting compartment 16 tc the center chamber 12. Also, each compaitment 16 has at least one outlet 18 connected to at least one fluid passageway or pipe 26. The center chamber 12 with the liquid flow controller 14 receives liquid from a liquid supply, not shown. At any rotated position, the controller 14 exposes and covers some areas or portions of passages 20 to liquid flow. When the controller 14 rotates to selected positions around its vertical central axis inside center chamber 12, changes in the areas covered and exposed to liquid flow are provided which changes amount of water flowing through these passages 20 to fluid passageways 26. Each passage 20 in each compartment 16 delivers liquid flow to fluid passageways 26, which are connected to different flights 30 of a separator 25. Fluid passageways 26 deliver washing liquid to a trough surface 33 of the spiral separator 25. Consequently, rotation of the controller 14 provides differing amounts of washing liquid to different flights 30 in the separator 25, as shown in FIG. 4. If an operator desires to increase or decrease the amount of washing liquid flowing into a trough surface 33, the operator simply rotates the controller 14 to cause delivery of more or less amount of liquid. The amount of washing liquid flowing into other flights also will change but the changes will generally be in proportion to the change in flow desired by the operator. The slanted edge 22 can be provided with different contours having differing properties for various separators which process different particulates.<br>
FIG. 2 shows a plan view of an embodiment of the washing liquid distributor 10. The distributor 10 can be of any shape but is shown here as a cylindrical configuration. A plurality of compartments 16 may be of any number and have one or more outlets 18, best shown in FIG. 1.<br>
FIG. 3 shows a cross section of a liquid distributor housing 10 disposed on top of a single spiral separator 25. A plurality of fluid passageways or liquid carrying fluid passageways 26 extends into a support column 28 of a spiral separator 25. The fluid passageways 26 pass through openings 27 in support column 28 to deliver washing liquid into dampening receivers 32 and 40 to reduce or<br>
Q<br><br>
dampen speed and kinetic energy of the liquid being fed from distributor 10, as shown more clearly in FIGS. 4-6. Receiver 32 laterally discharges washing liquid through bottom opening 32A into trough surface 33 adjacent an inner side of a liquid and concentrate channel 34 to assist in moving heavier concentrating particles flowing adjacent the inner side 34 to their drawoff entrances 35 spaced along the inner side 34. An adjustable rib 36 pivotally attached at 37 is positioned adjacent channel 34 and serves to divert heavier concentrating particles and water into concentrate channel 34.<br>
An alternative embodiment is shown in FIG. 5 wherein one fluid passageway 26 transports washing liquid from compartment 16, best shown in FIG. 1, to dampening receiver 32 and hence into receiver 40 as well. The fluid passageway 26 delivers washing liquid into receiver 32 and a portion of the liquid therefrom passes through the tube 26A into another receiver 40 spaced downwardly from receiver 32. This arrangement accomplishes an appropriate distribution of the washing liquid by dividing the volume of the liquid between two or more receivers 32 and 40 as may be required when the number of fluid passageways required coming down the support column exceeds the cross-section of the support column.<br>
In FIG. 6 A, B and C there is shown alternative embodiments. A single liquid distributor 10 in Figs. 6A, 6B and 6C distributes washing liquid to a plurality of spiral separators 25 shown separately but may be installed on the same column 28. Each of compartments 16 has double outlets 18 transferring washing liquid to two fluid passageways 26 to deliver the liquid to at least two trough surfaces 33 of spiral separators 25. A plurality of outlets for a plurality of fluid passageways can be employed here. An operator can control and manipulate flow of washing liquid into several separators by employing a single liquid distributor and liquid flow controller as shown here in.<br>
Fig. 6B shows another spiral separator unit similar to the one in Fig. 6A.<br>
10<br><br>
The embodiments shown in Figs. 6A and 6B can be combined to one double or triple thread spiral separator showing in Fig. 6C in order to increase capacity per installations space.<br>
FIG. 7 shows another alternative system embodiment. A main conventional liquid supply distributor 44 feeds washing liquid to a plurality of secondary distributors 10 at each of columns 28 of separators 25. An operator adjusts liquid flow to a plurality of separators 25 by simply manipulating control valve 45 via electrical valve 49 and flowmeter 47. This arrangement enables the operator to vary the flow of liquid to several separators 25 using a single valve 45 and to control the liquid flow for each separator 25 by its own distributor 10. The above arrangement can be automated to provide efficient and precise control of flow of washing liquid into several separators.<br>
FIG. 8 illustrates another system embodiment wherein a liquid supply tank 44A is connected to a flow control mechanism 46, which includes level sensor 53, water control valve 51 and on-stream analyzer 48. The on-stream analyzer 48 takes samples of the products at pre-tfetermined times and analyzes composition of each sample. The analyzer 48 sends the analysis data to the control mechanism 46 that uses the data to determine the amount of washing liquid necessary for the flight 30 in the separators 25 to ensure optimal separation of heavier concentrating particles from lighter particles. The control mechanism 46 manipulates water control valve 51 to adjust the height of liquid in tank 44A and the amount of washing liquid flowing therefrom, thereby adjusting the height of the liquid in each distributor 10.<br>
An alternative embodiment to washing liquid distributor 10 is shown by 10A in FIG. 9. The distributor housing 10A has a rectangular or oblong shape and includes a plurality of compartments 16A disposed on either side of a center chamber 12A. Each compartment 16A has at least one outlet 18A for transferring washing liquid from the compartment to a trough surface 33, see FIG. 4,  of a separator 25 through fluid  passageways carrying  liquid 26A.<br>
11<br><br>
Longitudinal cross sectional view of the distributor 10A are shown in FIGS. "10 and 11. Each compartment 16A has a longitudinal passage 20A communicating fluidly with the center chamber 12A. A rotatable elliptical cam 50 in the form of an elongated roll is placed under one end of distributor 10A, while the other side being supported on hinge joint 52. The distributor 10A is at flat level when cam 50 is horizontal or when its rotational angle is at zero. A certain area or portion of each passage 20A is exposed to washing liquid being supplied to the center chamber 12A. When cam 50 rotates preferably between angles zero to ninety, each passage 20A has a different area being exposed to permit more or less washing liquid to flow. As a result, different volumes of liquid flow through each passage 20A through outlets and into each trough surface 33 of a flight 30. The different amounts are in proportion to the angle of rotation of cam 50. An operator establishes the preferred amount of washing liquid for each flight 30 and the proportionate angles of rotation of the cam 50. An operator can increase or decrease the amount of water flowing into each flight without excessively increasing or decreasing the amount needed in other flights. The operator can simply rotate the cam a certain degree to attain a certain flow level entering one flight 30 and a proportional flow in the other flights. This action increases the efficiency of separating heavy from lighter particles by delivering precise amounts of liquid where it is needed into any appropriate flights. It also conserves washing liquid supplied to the separator because only needed quantities will be used. Also efficient operation of a large numbers of spirals each having a plurality of flights is achieved. A synchronized movement of all the cams for the distributor 10A can be achieved by use of a stepping motor to power the cam and such motors may be remotely controlled, as well known in the art.<br>
FIG. 12 illustrates a further embodiment for rotating cam 50A. Distributor 10A is at a flat level (0) when cam 50A is at approximately 45 degrees angle. When cam 50A rotates 45 degrees downwardly or negative 45 angle degrees, distributor 10A is tilted downwardly (-a). This tilting action changes exposure areas of passages 20A to washing liquid flow, thereby varying the amount of<br>
12<br><br>
flow to each trough surface 33 of a flight 30. When cam 50A rotates upwardly (+a), distributor 10A tilts upwardly, thus varying flow through each passage 20A to their corresponding trough surface 33 of a flight 30. Other alternative devices for tilting distributor 10A, known to those skilled in the art can also be used, such as lifting devices, screws, wedges, hydraulic cylinders, pistons and motors, and so forth.<br>
FIG. 13 shows an alternative embodiment of the washing liquid distribution system. A housing 54 contains a plurality of members or fluid passageways 55 disposed inside the housing 54 and each have a generally vertical passage 56 for receiving liquid from the housing 54 into the fluid passageways 55 for delivering the liquid to flights of a spiral separator, shown in FIGS. 4-8. The fluid passageways 55 have a height less than that of the housing 10. In contrast to the embodiment of FIG. 1 where liquid flows through passages 20 in compartments 16 into passageways 26, liquid may flow directly from housing 54 into passages 56 of fluid passageways 55, as shown in FIG. 13. Fluid passageways 55 may or may not be the same fluid passageways 59, which extend through the column 28 of the separator shown in FIGS. 3 and 4. The housing 54 may be supported on a direct powered pivotal axle 57 midway of the housing 54 or on a combination of a non-powered pivotal axle 57 midway and tilting means such as a rotatable elliptical cam 58 underneath one end of the housing 54, as shown in FIGS. 10 - 12. Rotating the elliptical cam 58 or the powered pivotal axle 57 slants the housing 54, thereby changing water level flowing into passages 56 of fluid passageways 55 and thence delivering differing amounts of liquid to different flights of the spiral separator.<br>
FIG. 13A depicts a generally vertical passage 56A that can be applied if desired to the embodiments shown in FIGS. 1 and 9-12. The V-shaped passage 56A is formed in the upper end of the passageway 55 and is tapered from the top to the bottom including an angle (X) of about 15 to 30 degrees. The passage 56A is tapered to provide greater flow of washing liquid in the upper portion of the<br>
13<br><br>
passageway 55 thus rendering the tilt adjustment more readily ccntroHable for flow control to the spiral.<br>
FIG. 13B shows a generally vertical elliptically passage 56B formed at the end of the passageway 55 and can be applied to the embodiments shown in FIG. 13. Also, it is clear that a generally vertical elliptical passage may also be applied if desired to the embodiments of FIGS. 1 and 9-12. On one hand, controlling the amount of water flowing from passage 56B may be more difficult compared to passage 56A on the other hand, passage 56B may be easier to manufacture on a commercial basis. Other shapes of generally vertical passages or passages having an elongated axis extending generally vertically may also be used without departing trom tnis invention.<br>
While the invention has described with respect to certain specific embodiments, it will be appreciated that many modifications and changes may be made by those skilled in the art without depaiting from the spirit of the invention. It is intended, therefore, by the appended claims to cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
