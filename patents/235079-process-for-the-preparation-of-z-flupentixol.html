**********<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the separation of isomers<br>
of flupentixol, particularly a process for the preparation of Z-flupentixol<br>
and its decanoate ester and novel synthetic intermediates thereof.<br>
TECHNICAL BACKGROUND<br>
Flupentixol, or 2-[4-[3-[2-trifluoromethyl-thioxanthen-9-ylidene]-propyl]-<br>
piperazin-l-yl]-ethanol represents the active ingredient of a<br>
neuroleptic drug for the treatment of psychotic disorders, particularly<br>
for the treatment of schizophrenia.<br>
Flupentixol consists of a mixture of two geometric isomers, Z and E. The<br>
Z isomer of flupentixol, hereinafter also referred to as Z-flupentixol, is the<br>
more active isomer and currently also marketed as the decanoate<br>
ester thereof.<br>
GB 925538 generically describes that the separation of the two<br>
flupentixol isomers can be carried out by the fractional crystallisation<br>
of the dihydrochloride. However, such separation seems to have<br>
never found a real industrial application.<br>
US 3681346 describes the separation of the Z and E isomers of<br>
flupentixol by the fractional crystallisation of flupentixol base from ethyl<br>
ether. However, the separation of the two isomers by the crystallisation<br>
of flupentixol base is known to provide no good results, above all if<br>
there are many impurities present in the starting mixture.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide an improved process<br>
for the separation of the flupentixol isomers, more precisely a process<br>
for the preparation of Z-flupentixol and the decanoate ester thereof,<br>
in the pure form.<br>
It has been surprisingly found that the separation of the isomers by the<br>
crystallisation of one particular ester of flupentixol provides optimal<br>
results in terms of yield and purity.<br>
Indeed, it has been found that one particular ester derivative of<br>
flupentixol constitutes an intermediate which is particularly suitable for<br>
fractional crystallisation, said ester derivative being easily separable<br>
into the two Z and E isomers.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Thus according to one of its embodiments, the present invention<br>
concerns a process for the preparation of Z-flupentixol which<br>
comprises preparing a hydrochloride of the p-chlorobenzoate ester of<br>
flupentixol and separating said ester into its Z and E isomers by<br>
fractional crystallisation.<br>
As an alternative to the p-chlorobenzoate ester, for the purposes of<br>
the invention, other ester derivatives may be used, for example the<br>
methanesulfonate ester, the p-toluenesulfonate ester, or esters with<br>
aromatic carboxylic acids, for example benzoic acid, substituted on<br>
the aromatic carbons with at least one polar and/or electron-<br>
withdrawing substituent, for example the p-nitrobenzoate, 3,4-<br>
dichlorobenzoate and 2,4-dichlorobenzoate esters, said esters forming<br>
subject-matter of the present invention.<br>
As used in the description herein, even when not expressly indicated,<br>
the term "fluxopentixol" refers to a mixture of the Z and E isomers, whilst<br>
the terms "E-fluxopentixol" and "Z-fluxopentixol" refer to the pure<br>
isomers or to a mixture of the two compounds wherein, the E isomer<br>
and the Z isomer are the preponderant isomers. The degree of purity<br>
of the mixture is given as the percentage (by weight) of the amount of<br>
the preponderant isomer in the mixture.<br>
More particularly, the invention concerns a process for the<br>
preparation of Z-flupentixol which comprises:<br>
(a) making Z/E flupentixol react with the chloride salt of p-<br>
chlorobenzoic acid in a solvent selected from ethyl acetate,<br>
acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methylene chloride, dioxane<br>
and tetrahydrofuran, by heating;<br>
(b) cooling the reaction mixture and separating the precipitate<br>
from the mother liquors containing the Z-flupentixol p-<br>
chlorobenzoate ester;<br>
(c) heating the mother liquors from the previous step and<br>
adding hydrochloric acid;<br>
(d) cooling the reaction mixture in order to recover the<br>
hydrochloride salt of the Z-flupentixol p-chlorobenzoate ester<br>
thus precipitated;<br>
(e) hydrolysing the ester in order to obtain Z-flupentixol.<br>
The starting flupentixol used in step (a) may be produced by the<br>
condensation of 2-trifluoromethyl-9-(-propyliden)-thioxanthene with N-<br>
(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine or prepared using other synthetic methods.<br>
Illustrative examples are provided in the experimental section which<br>
follows.<br>
Even if crude, the flupentixol directly derived from the aforesaid<br>
condensation, which normally requires further purification, may<br>
anyway be used in step (a) of the process. Indeed, it has been<br>
observed that in the esterification reaction of step (a), notwithstanding<br>
the possible presence of impurities in the starting product, the p-<br>
chlorobenzoate ester forms in a satisfactory manner and the<br>
separation of its isomers by crystallisation proceeds excellently, unlike<br>
the same separation carried out directly on crude, non-esterified<br>
flupentixol.<br>
According to the present invention, a particularly advantageous<br>
solvent for the esterification step (a) is ethyl acetate, in that it allows<br>
for excellent separation of the isomers.<br>
In the reaction in step (a), by the expression "by heating" is meant<br>
that all the reagents must be brought into solution by heating;<br>
preferably, the reaction in step (a) is carried out at a temperature<br>
comprised of between 40°C and the reflux temperature of the solvent<br>
used, advantageously around 70°C.<br>
The reaction is complete in a few hours, and its progress may be<br>
followed by one skilled in the art, using conventional methods.<br>
With the reaction in step (b), the E isomer of the ester thus formed<br>
precipitates, whilst the desired Z isomer remains in solution. The<br>
precipitate is separated from the mother liquors and the isolated E<br>
isomer may be recovered and, if desired, converted according to<br>
known techniques. Examples of the recovery of such isomer are<br>
reported in the following experimental section.<br>
In step (c), the mother liquors separated in step (b) are lightly heated,<br>
for example to between 40 and 50°C, and hydrochloric acid is added<br>
therein.<br>
Advantageously, in step (c) hydrochloric acid is added in molar<br>
amounts almost equal to half that of the starting Z/E flupentixol, for<br>
example, in amounts comprised of between 0.4 and 0.6 moles of<br>
hydrochloric acid per mole of starting Z/E flupentixol.<br>
The hydrochloric acid used in step (c) may be for example in the form<br>
of an aqueous solution of known concentration.<br>
According to the present invention, the hydrochloride salts of<br>
flupentixol or the esters thereof, obtained according to the processes<br>
of the invention, may be formed with n equivalents of hydrochloric<br>
acid, where n is a number, not necessarily an integer, comprised of<br>
between 0.5 and 2. For example hemi-hydrochloride, mono-<br>
hydrochloride, di-hydrochloride salts, etc. may thus be formed, the<br>
stoichiometric ratios being a function of the reaction conditions.<br>
Consequently, according to the present invention, unless there is any<br>
specific indication to the contrary, by the term "hydrochloride" is<br>
meant a salt with hydrochloric acid in any ratio of acid-base<br>
equivalents.<br>
Flupentixol p-chlorobenzoate, its Z and E isomers and salts thereof,<br>
including the hydrochloride salts thereof in whichever stoichiometric<br>
ratio of acid-base equivalents, are novel products and constitute a<br>
further subject of the present invention.<br>
The Z-flupentixol p-chlorobenzoate ester isolated as the hydrochloride<br>
in step (d) is normally appreciably pure and may be converted into<br>
Z-flupentixol by the hydrolysis in step (e) according to conventional<br>
techniques, for example by reacting with a mineral or organic base,<br>
with alkaline metal or alkaline earth metal hydroxides, for example<br>
with potassium hydroxide.<br>
As mentioned above, the Z and E isomers of flupentixol can be<br>
separated according to the process of the present invention, even by<br>
means of an ester other than p-chlorobenzoate, for example by using<br>
the above mentioned esters, the p-chlorobenzoate ester however<br>
being a particularly preferred ester.<br>
If desired or necessary, the Z-flupentixol obtained from step (e) may be<br>
further purified by crystallisation from an appropriate solvent.<br>
Particularly, it has now been found that the crystallisation of Z-<br>
flupentixol from cyclohexane leads to a particularly pure product,<br>
suitable for use as a drug.<br>
The crystallisation of Z-flupentixol from cyclohexane constitutes a<br>
further subject of the invention.<br>
According to another aspect thereof, the invention also concerns the<br>
process of steps (a) to (e) as defined above wherein, following step<br>
(e), the Z-flupentixo! obtained is crystallised from cyclohexane.<br>
The crystallisation from cyclohexane is carried out according to<br>
conventional techniques, for example by bringing the Z-flupentixol into<br>
solution by heating and slowly cooling, in order to obtain the<br>
precipitation of the desired product.<br>
The Z-flupentixol obtained following crystallisation from cyclohexane<br>
shows purity greater than 99% and conforms to European<br>
Pharmacopoeia requirements for this product.<br>
If desired or necessary, the pure Z-flupentixol thus obtained may be<br>
later converted into the decanoate ester thereof by simple<br>
esterification according to known techniques.<br>
Thus, according to a further aspect, the present invention has as a<br>
subject, a process for the preparation of Z-flupentixol decanoate ester<br>
which comprises the above described steps from (a) to (e), followed<br>
by the following steps:<br>
(f) crystallising the Z-flupentixol from step (e) from cyclohexane;<br>
and<br>
(g) converting the pure Z-flupentixol thus obtained into Z-<br>
flupentixol decanoate ester.<br>
The crystallisation in step (f) may be carried out as described above.<br>
The esterification reaction in step (g) may be carried out according to<br>
the usual techniques well known to any expert in the art, for example,<br>
by reaction of the product isolated in step (f) with decanoic acid or<br>
an activated derivative thereof, such as the corresponding acyl<br>
chloride, in an appropriate solvent.<br>
If the reaction in step (g) is carried out with decanoyl chloride, then a<br>
hydrochloride salt of the Z-flupentixol decanoate ester is obtained.<br>
Hence, the invention provides an original and effective process for the<br>
separation of the flupentixol isomers and for the preparation of Z-<br>
flupentixol decanoate ester, with optimal yield and high purity.<br>
The examples reported in the following experimental section illustrate<br>
particular embodiments of the invention, without however being<br>
limiting in any way.<br>
Experimental section<br>
Step 1: preparation of 2-trifluoromethvl-9-allvl-9-thioxanthenol<br>
To a solution of 6.6 g (0.046 mol) of methyl iodide and 0.3 g<br>
(0.001 mol) of iodine in 1050 ml of tetrahydrofuran 136.5 g (5.6 molj of<br>
magnesium shavings are added, under an atmosphere of nitrogen.<br>
To the suspension thus obtained a solution of 172.5 g (2.25 mol) of ally!<br>
chloride in 172.5 ml of tetrahydrofuran is added by following these<br>
methods: approx. 10% of the solution is added and the spontaneous<br>
initiation of the reaction, indicated by a sudden increase in the<br>
temperature, is awaited; whilst maintaining the temperature between<br>
45 and 50°C, the remainder of the solution is then added over a<br>
period of approx. 90 minutes. Upon complete addition, the<br>
temperature is maintained at 45-50°C for 30 minutes. The reaction<br>
mixture is cooled to 25°C and a solution of 315 g (1.12 mol) of 2-<br>
trifluoromethyl-9-thioxanthone in 1,425 ml of tetrahydrofuran is added<br>
over a period of 2 hours whilst maintaining the temperature below<br>
30°C. At the end of the addition, it is kept stirring for a further hour. The<br>
reaction mixture is then poured into a solution of 160 g of ammonium<br>
chloride in 1,500 ml of water whilst maintaining the temperature below<br>
30°C. The phases are separated and the aqueous phase is extracted<br>
with 750 ml of toluene. The organic phases are combined and<br>
washed, first with a solution of 80 g of ammonium chloride in 750 ml of<br>
water, and subsequently with a solution of 40 g of sodium chloride in<br>
750 ml of water. The organic phase is concentrated to a residue by<br>
the evaporation of the solvent under vacuum and 372 g of 2-<br>
trifluoromethyl-9-allyl-9-thioxanthenol (quantitative yield) are obtained.<br>
An aliquot of the product has been purified by column<br>
chromatography and has been characterised by JH-NMR<br>
spectroscopic analysis: 1H-NMR (300 MHz, CDCb): 2.52 (1H, dd); 2.64<br>
(1H, dd); 3 (1H, s); 5.1 (2H, m); 5.42 (1H, m); 7.2-7.8 (7H, m).<br>
Step 2:_____preparation of 2-trifluoromethvl-9-(2-propenvliden)-<br>
thioxanthene<br>
To a solution of 372 g (1.12 mol) of 2-trifluoromethyl-9-ally!-9-<br>
thioxanthenol in 372 ml of toluene, maintained at 40°C, a solution of<br>
5.3 g (0.067 mol) of acetyl chloride in 160.5 g (1.57 mol) of acetic<br>
anhydride is added, over a period of 30 minutes. The solution is<br>
heated to 50-55°C and maintained at that temperature for one hour.<br>
The mixture is concentrated to a residue by evaporation of the solvent<br>
under vacuum and 350 g of 2-trifluoromethyl-9-(2-propenyliden)-<br>
thioxanthene (quantitative yield) are obtained. An aliquot of the<br>
product has been purified by column chromatography and has been<br>
characterised by 1H-NMR spectroscopic analysis: 1H-NMR (300 MHz,<br>
CDCb): 5.4 (1H, m); 5.6 (1H, m);6.57 (1H, t); 6.83 (1H, m); 2-7.8 (7H, m)<br>
Step 3: preparation of 9-[3-(4-hvdroxvethyl-]-piperazinvl)propylidenel-<br>
2-trifluoromethyl-thioxanthene (Z/E), Z/E Flupentixol<br>
A solution of 350 g (1.12 mol) of 2-trifluoromethyl-9-(2-<br>
propenyliden)-thioxanthene in 1,890 g (14.5 mol) of N-(2-<br>
hydroxyethyl)piperazine is heated to 100°C for 7 hours. The excess N-<br>
(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine is distilled off at a temperature of 100-120°C<br>
under reduced pressure of 0.2-1 mm/Hg. To the residue 2,490 ml of<br>
toluene and 490 ml of water are added and it is left stirring for 15<br>
minutes at 70°C. The aqueous phase is separated and two washes of<br>
the organic phase are carried out using 490 ml of water (for each<br>
wash) whilst maintaining the temperature at 60-70°C. An extraction of<br>
the aqueous phase is carried out using 490 ml of toluene and the two<br>
organic phases are combined. The combined organic phase is<br>
concentrated to a residue by evaporation of the solvent under<br>
vacuum. The residue is dissolved in 1,920 ml of ethyl acetate and the<br>
solution heated to 50°C. 1,340 ml of 10% aqueous sulphuric acid are<br>
added over a period of 15-20 minutes and the mixture is left stirring for<br>
15 minutes. The phases are separated and 920 ml of ethyl acetate<br>
added to the acidic aqueous phase. The mixture is left stirring at 60°C<br>
for 15 minutes and the phases separated. To the acidic aqueous<br>
phase are added 1,920 ml of ethyl acetate, and 190 g of aqueous<br>
30% ammonia are added dropwise whilst maintaining the<br>
temperature below 30°C. The phases are separated and the organic<br>
phase washed with 900 mi of a 5% aqueous sodium chloride solution.<br>
The organic phase is concentrated to residue by the evaporation of<br>
the solvent under reduced pressure and 425 g of (Z/E) 9-[3-(4-<br>
hydroxyethyl-l-piperazinyl)propylidene]-2-trifluoromethyl-thioxanthene<br>
(Flupentixol Z/E) are obtained, yield 87%, isomeric ratio Z/E = 47/53.<br>
Step 4: preparation of Z Flupentixol p-chlorobenzoate.2HCl<br>
A solution of 425 g (0.98 mol) of Z/E Flupentixol in 1,750 ml of<br>
ethyl acetate is heated to 40°C. A solution of 213 g (1.21 mol) of p-<br>
chlorobenzoyl chloride in 660 ml of ethyl acetate is added dropwise,<br>
the reaction mixture is heated to 70°C and maintained at that<br>
temperature for 1 hour. The reaction mixture is cooled to 5°C and the<br>
product is filtered, washing it on the filter with 220 ml of ethyl acetate.<br>
The wet product is dried at 50°C under vacuum for 24 hours and 332 g<br>
of E Flupentixol p-chlorobenzoate.HC! are obtained which is set aside<br>
for later recovery. The mother liquors from the previous filtration are<br>
heated to 40°C. 43 g (0.43 mol) of 37% aqueous hydrochloric acid are<br>
added over 15 minutes and the mixture progressively cooled down to<br>
15°C. The product is filtered, washing it on the filter with 140 ml of ethyl<br>
acetate. The wet product is dried at 50°C under vacuum for 24 hours<br>
and 208 g of Z Flupentixol p-ch!orobenzoate.2HCI are obtained,<br>
having an isomeric purity of 85% (15 % E), with a yield of 33%. The<br>
product has been characterised by 'H-NMR spectroscopic analysis:<br>
1H-NMR (300 MHz, DMSO-d6): 2.79 (2H, m); 3.2-3.7 (12 H, m); 4.53 (2 H,<br>
bs); 6.03(1 H,t), 7.2-8.1 (11 H, m).<br>
MASS SPECTROMETRY (FAB +): 573 (molecular peak).<br>
Step 5: preparation of Z Flupentixol<br>
To a mixture of 178 g (0.27 mol) of Z Flupentixol p-<br>
chlorobenzoate.2HCI, 600 ml of methyl alcohol and 92 ml of water 63<br>
g (1 mol) of 90% potassium hydroxide are added. The mixture is<br>
heated to 55°C and maintained at that temperature for 1 hour. It is<br>
concentrated to a residue by the distillation of the solvent under<br>
reduced pressure and 920 ml of water and 920 ml of toluene are<br>
added. The mixture is heated to 70 °C, the phases are separated, and<br>
the aqueous phase extracted with 150 ml of toluene. The organic<br>
phases are combined and two washes are performed using 300 ml (for<br>
each wash) of a 10% aqueous solution of sodium chloride. The<br>
organic phase is concentrated to a residue by the evaporation of the<br>
solvent under vacuum and 300 ml of cyclohexane are added. It is<br>
once again concentrated to a residue and 820 ml of cyclohexane<br>
added. The entire mixture is brought into solution by heating to 60°C<br>
and the solution filtered whilst maintaining said heating. The solution is<br>
cooled slowly to 15°C thus obtaining the crystallisation of the product.<br>
The product is filtered and washed on the filter with 70 ml of<br>
cyclohexane. The wet product is dried at 40°C under vacuum for 16<br>
hours and 82 g of Z Flupentixol are obtained, having an isomeric purity<br>
of 99.7%. Yield 70%. The product has been characterised by 1H-NMR<br>
spectroscopic analysis: 1H-NMR (300 MHz, CDCb): 2.5-2.6 (14H, m);<br>
3.57-3.61 (2 H, t); 5.94-5.97 (1 H, t) 7.22-7'.65 (7H, m).<br>

To a solution of 90 g (0.207 mol) of Z Flupentixol in 270 ml of<br>
acetone 47.4 g (0.24 mol) of decanoyl chloride are added over a<br>
period of 30 minutes. The mixture is heated to reflux temperature<br>
(58°C) and maintained at such temperature for 1 hour. The mixture is<br>
cooled to 25°C and 1,090 ml of ethyl acetate added. 126 ml of a 1.95<br>
M solution of hydrochloric acid in ethyl acetate are added dropwise<br>
thus achieving the precipitation of the product. The reaction mixture is<br>
progressively cooled to 5°C and the product is filtered, washing it on<br>
the filter with 100 ml of ethyl acetate. The wet product is dried at 50°C<br>
under vacuum for 16 hours and 117 g of Z Flupentixol decanoate.2HCI<br>
are obtained (yield 85%). The product has been characterised by ]H-<br>

°C, the phases are separated, and the aqueous phase extracted with<br>
250 ml of toluene. The organic phases are combined and two washes<br>
are performed using 500 ml (for each wash) of a 10% aqueous solution<br>
of sodium chloride. The organic phase is concentrated to a residue by<br>
distillation of the solvent under reduced pressure and 2,080 ml of<br>
acetone are added. The residue is heated to 35°C and 98 g (0.99<br>
mol) of aqueous hydrochloric acid are added dropwise over a period<br>
of 15 minutes. 37%. The mixture is kept stirring whilst spontaneously<br>
cooling over a period of 16 hours. The mixture is cooled to 10°C and<br>
filtered using a buchner funnel, washing the filtrate on the filter with<br>
100 ml of acetone. The filtrate is dried at 50°C for 18 hours and 180 g<br>
of E Flupentixol di-hydrochloride are obtained (98.1% E, 1.9% Z), yield<br>
74%.<br>
Step 9: preparation of Z Flupentixol di-hvdrochloride<br>
To a mixture of 250 g (0.39 mol) of Z Flupentixol p-<br>
chlorobenzoate.2HCI, (75% Z, 25% E), 860 ml of methyl alcohol and 133<br>
ml of water 91 g (1.46 mo!) of 90% potassium hydroxide are added.<br>
The mixture is heated to 55°C and maintained at that temperature for<br>
1 hour. The mixture is concentrated to a residue by the distillation of<br>
the solvent under reduced pressure and 1,315 ml of water and 1,315<br>
ml of toluene are added. The mixture is heated to 70 °C, the phases<br>
are separated, and the aqueous phase extracted with 215 ml of<br>
toluene. The organic phases are combined and two washes are<br>
performed using 500 ml (for each wash) of a 10% aqueous solution of<br>
sodium chloride. The organic phases are combined and two washes<br>
are performed using 430 ml (for each wash) of a 10% aqueous solution<br>
of sodium chloride. The organic phase is concentrated to a residue by<br>
distillation of the solvent under reduced pressure and 1,720 ml of<br>
acetone are added. The residue is heated to 35°C and 81 g (0.82<br>
mol) of aqueous hydrochloric acid are added dropwise over a period<br>
of 15 minutes. 37%. The mixture is kept stirring whilst spontaneously<br>
cooling over a period of 16 hours. The mixture is cooled to 10°C and<br>
filtered using a buchner funnel, washing the filtrate on the filter with<br>
100 ml of acetone. The filtrate is dried at 50°C for 18 hours and 146 g<br>
of Z Flupentixol di-hydrochloride are obtained (74% Z, 26% E), yield 74%.<br>
Step 10: preparation of Z/E Flupentixol di-hydrochloride.<br>
To a mixture of 1,900 ml of isopropyl alcohol and 64 ml of distilled<br>
water 75 g of E Flupentixol di-hydrochloride (98.1% E, 1.9% Z) and 140 g<br>
of Z Flupentixol di-hydrochloride (74% Z, 26% E) are added. The<br>
amounts of the two di-hydrochloride salts used depend on the Z/E<br>
isomeric ratios of the individual products: the calculation is performed<br>
in such a way as to obtain, in the initial crystallisation solution, a Z<br>
isomer content of 47-52% (in this case, it is equal to 48.8%). The mixture<br>
is heated to reflux temperature (80°C) thus obtaining complete<br>
dissolution. 5 g of activated charcoal are added and the solution<br>
filtered whilst maintaining the temperature above 50°C. The solution is<br>
progressively cooled thus achieving the crystallisation of the product.<br>
The solution is brought to a temperature of 5°C and filtered using a<br>
buchner funnel, washing the filtrate with 200 ml of isopropyl alcohol.<br>
The wet product is dried at 50°C under vacuum for 24 hours thus<br>
obtaining 185.5 g (yield 86%) of Z/E FLUPENTIXOL DIHYDROCHLORIDE<br>
(45.5% Z, 54.5% E)<br>
The product has been characterised by 1H-NMR spectroscopic<br>
analysis: 1H-NMR (300 MHz, CDC13): 2.62 (2H, m); 2.9-3.2 (2 H, m); 3.37<br>
