BACKGROUND<br>
[0004] Fluorescent dyes have been used for the detection and analysis of biological samples. As fluorescent dyes are highly sensitive, they can be used to detect a very small number of fluorescent molecules. For example, such fluorescent dyes can be used to detect fewer than 50 fluorescent molecules that are associated with cells. Barak, el al, J. Cell Biol. 90, 595 (1981).<br>
[0005] Fluorescent dyes may be used as probes for use in imaging in live cells or tissue samples. For example, a fluorescent-dye probe bound to a receptor on the surface of Dictyostelium cells has been used in the imaging of a single molecule of fluorescently labeled cAMP. Ueda, et al., Science 294, 864 (2001). Several fluorescent probes having different fluorescent wavelengths may be used to perform multi-color imaging in live cells or tissue samples. Fluorescent probes are highly sensitive, of relatively low toxicity, and easy to dispose of relative to radioactive probes.<br>
[0006] Fluorescent dyes can be used in the detection of nucleic acids, including DNA and RNA, and biological samples involving nucleic acids. Nucleic acid polymers such as DNA and RNA are involved in the transmission of genetic information from one generation to the next and to the routine functioning of living organisms. Nucleic acids are thus of interest and the objects of study. Fluorescent nucleic acid dyes that specifically bind to nucleic acids and form highly fluorescent complexes are useful tools for such study. These dyes can be used to detect the presence and quantities of DNA and RNA in a variety of media, including pure solutions, cell extracts, electrophoretic gels, micro-array chips, live or fixed cells, dead cells, and environmental samples. These dyes can be used in the quantitative detection of DNA in real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), which is a technique used in genomic research and medical diagnosis.<br>
[0007] Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a primer extension reaction that provides a method for amplifying specific nucleic acids in vitro. Generally, in PCR, the reaction solution is maintained for a short period at each of three temperatures, 96°C, 60°C and 72°C, to allow strand separation or denaturation, annealing, and chain extension, respectively. These three temperature<br>
stages are repeated for 30 or 40 cycles with the use of an automated thermo-cycler that can heat or cool the tube containing the reaction mixture very rapidly. By repeating the PCR cycle, a million-fold copies of a DNA sample can be produced in a single enzymatic reaction mixture within a matter of hours, enabling researchers to determine the size and sequence of target DNA. This DNA amplification technique has been used for cloning and other molecular biological manipulations. Further discussion of PCR is provided in Mullis, et al, Methods Enzymol (1987), and Saiki, et al, Science (1985).<br>
[0008] One PCR-based technique that is useful is quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Briefly, the mechanism of qPCR is based on PCR amplification of a target DNA in an exponential manner. By running a PCR reaction and measuring the total number of DNA copies at given points during the course of the amplification reaction, one can retroactively calculate the amount of starting DNA material.<br>
[0009] Fluorescence-based DNA detection is a generally sensitive, versatile, and convenient detection method that is used in qPCR. There are two types of fluorescent reagents used in qPCR. The first type is based on oligonucleotides labeled with one or more fluorescent dyes, or with a combination of a fluorescent dye and a quencher dye. These labeled oligonucleotides release fluorescence either upon hybridization to a target sequence, or upon cleavage of the oligonucleotides following hybridization in a manner proportional to the amount of DNA present. The mechanism and the use of the oligo-based fluorescent reagents have been described in various patents and publications. See, for example, Holland, et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1991); Lee, et al, Nucleic Acids Res. (1993); and U.S. Patent Nos. 5,210,015, 5,538,848, 6,258,569, 5,691,146, 5,925,517, 5,118,801, 5,312,728, and 6,635,427. Although oligo-based fluorescent reagents for qPCR have the advantage of being highly specific toward a target sequence, they are very complex in design and consequently expensive to use. The second type of fluorescent reagents used in qPCR is based on DNA-binding fluorescent dyes, which are commonly referred to as fluorescent nucleic acid dyes or stains. Because fluorescent nucleic acid dyes are relatively simple molecules, they are easy to manufacture and thus inexpensive to use. Their application in qPCR is useful for routine genetic detection in research labs.<br>
[0010] Not all commonly available fluorescent nucleic acid stains can be used for qPCR. Ideally, a fluorescent nucleic acid dye should meet certain criteria for it to be suitable for qPCR use. First, it should be chemically stable during PCR and storage. Since PCR is carried out at high temperature, the dye should be thermo-stable. Additionally, since the pH of the Tris buffer used for PCR can vary considerably from alkaline (pH 8.5) at low temperature (4°C) to neutral or slightly acidic at high temperature, the dye should be resistant to acid- or base-assisted decomposition. Second, the dye, when present in the PCR solution, should not inhibit the PCR process. Third, the dye should be non-fluorescent or minimally fluorescent in the absence of DNA, and should become highly fluorescent in the presence of DNA. Fourth, the dye should have absorption and emission wavelengths that are compatible with existing instruments, which are normally equipped with optical channels optimized for common fluorescent dyes, such as FAM, JOE, VIC (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), TAMRA, ROX, Texas Red, Cy3, and Cy5, for example. Fifth, the dye should bind with DNA with little or no sequence preference. Sixth, the DNA-dye complexes should have fluorescence intensities that are linearly related to the amount of DNA present.<br>
[0011] Given the foregoing criteria, it is not surprising that very few nucleic acid- binding dyes can be used for qPCR. Ethidium bromide (EB) is a DNA dye that has been used to demonstrate the feasibility of using a simple dye for qPCR. Higuchi, et al, Bio-Technol 10(4), 413 (1992). However, EB suffers from problems of low sensitivity and undesirable wavelengths. A widely used dye for qPCR is SYBR Green I from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, Oregon (OR)). Wittwer, et al, Biotechniques 22(1), 130 (1997). SYBR Green I is a cyclically substituted asymmetric cyanine dye. Zipper, et al, Nucleic Acids Res. 32(12), e!03 (2004); and U.S. Patent Nos. 5,436,134 and 5,658,751. The advantages of SYBR Green I are that it has excitation and emission wavelengths very closely matching those of FAM, with which most of the instruments are compatible, and that it is highly fluorescent when bound to DNA. Recently, a DNA dye called LC Green was used for qPCR, although the structure of the dye was not disclosed. Although the LC Green dye appears to have desirable wavelengths matching the commonly used FAM optical channel in most of the PCR instruments, it is much less sensitive than SYBR Green I. More recently, a DNA minor groove-binder called BEBO and a related dye called BOXTO, both of which are asymmetric cyanine dyes, have been reported for use in qPCR. Bengtsson, et<br>
al, Nucleic Acids Res. 31(8), e45 (2003); and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004/0132046. Like LC Green, both BEBO and BOXTO significantly lag behind SYBR Green I in terms of sensitivity.<br>
[0012] Although SYBR Green I has been widely used as a DNA dye for qPCR, it still is lacking in several respects. For one, SYBR Green I has an inhibitory effect on the PCR process, which limits the maximum signal strength one can achieve by increasing dye concentration. The fluorescent signal strength of qPCR using SYBR Green I is initially proportional to the dye concentration until the dye concentration reaches a point where the dye starts to inhibit the PCR process significantly. A further increase in dye concentration will actually lower the signal strength or increase the cycle number (Ct) because of reduced DNA amplification. For another, SYBR Green I is chemically unstable under alkaline conditions, such as the alkaline condition of the PCR buffer when stored at low temperature. It has been reported that SYBR Green I stored in Tris buffer at 4°C decomposes significantly over the course of a few days and that the dye decomposition products are apparently potent inhibitors. Karsai, et al., BioTechniques 32(4), 790 (2002). For yet another, SYBR Green I provides only one fluorescence color. Many commercially available fluorescence detection instruments have multiple optical channels (the FAM optical channel and additional other optical channels) and are thus capable of detecting multiple fluorescence colors.<br>
[0013] Development of fluorescent dyes or the making or the use thereof is desirable.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0014] A method of producing or designing a fluorescent dye suitable for useful application, such as in a qPCR process, for example, is provided. The method involves covalently linking two or three monomeric dyes via a bridge that may be flexible and substantially neutral (for example, neutral or slightly charged). A method of producing or designing a dye, as provided herein, may allow for the development of a fluorescent nucleic acid dye that has a wavelength and/or other spectral property that heretofore could not be obtained.<br>
[0015] A fluorescent dye suitable for useful application, such as that described above, for example, is provided. A dimeric or trimeric dye, which may be produced according to a method<br>
described herein, may form a hairpin structure, which, it is believed, may enable the dye to stain nucleic acids via a release-on-demand mechanism, as further described herein. A dye described herein may have at least one feature or all of the following features: relatively low "fluorescence background" (fluorescence in the absence of nucleic acids), if any, and ideally, no fluorescence background; relatively low PCR inhibition, and ideally, no PCR inhibition; relatively high fluorescent signal strength; and relative high stability. The dye may be better as to at least one of these features, or as to all of these features, than an existing dye, such as S YBR Green I, merely by way of example. A dye described herein may have a property, such as a wavelength and/or another spectral property, for example, that heretofore could not be obtained.<br>
[0016] Dimeric and/or trimeric nucleic acid dyes or stains that are capable of intramolecular dimer formation, or the formation of a hairpin structure, are provided. It is believed that a hairpin-shaped dye may non-fluorescent or minimally fluorescent by itself, but may become highly fluorescent in the presence of nucleic acids. It is believed that nucleic acid binding of the dye may occur via an intermediate state wherein the dye forms, in part, an open random conformation. It is further believed that this open random conformation of the dye may exist in a small quantity and in equilibrium with the hairpin state. It is believed that as the amount of nucleic acids increases, an equilibrium shift from the hairpin state toward the nucleic acid-bound state of the dye may occur, such that the strength of the resulting fluorescence signal may be substantially linearly proportional to the amount of nucleic acids present.<br>
[0017] The above-described mechanism, which may be referred to as a release-on- demand mechanism of DNA staining, may be desirable for various applications, such as quantitative, real-time PCR (qPCR), for example. Merely by way of explanation, it is believed that the formation of the hairpin structure may render the "effective dye concentration" low, such that a dye described herein may interfere very little with the PCR process. Thus, as compared with previous dyes, such as SYBR Green I, for example, a higher concentration of a dye described herein may be used in qPCR. This higher concentration of dye may increase DNA detection sensitivity, perhaps significantly.<br>
[0018] A method of determining nucleic acid formation or a lack thereof in a sample is provided. The sample may or may not comprise a target nucleic acid. Such a method may comprise<br>

[0044] Various terms are generally described below or used herein to facilitate understanding. It will be understood that a corresponding general description of these various terms applies to corresponding linguistic or grammatical variations or forms of these various terms. It will also be understood that the general description of any term below may not apply or may not fully apply when the term is used in a non- general or more specific manner.

It will further be understood that embodiments described herein or applications described herein, are not limiting, as such may vary.<br>
[0045] Generally, the terms "stain" and "dye" may be used interchangeably and refer to an aromatic molecule capable of absorbing light in the spectral range of from about 250 nm to about 1,200 nm. Generally, the term "dye" may refer to a fluorescent dye, a non-fluorescent dye, or both. Generally, the term "fluorescent dye" refers to a dye capable of emitting light when excited by another light of appropriate wavelength.<br>
[0046] Generally, the term "fluorescence quencher" refers to a molecule capable of quenching the fluorescence of another fluorescent molecule. Fluorescence quenching can occur via at least one of the three ways. The first type of fluorescence quenching occurs via fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) (Forster, Ann. Phys. (1948); and Stryer, et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci (1967)), wherein a quencher absorbs the emission light from a fluorescent molecule. The absorption peak of a FRET quencher usually has to have significant overlap with the emission peak of a fluorescent dye for the FRET quencher to be an efficient fluorescent quencher. A FRET quencher is typically a non-fluorescent dye, but can also be a fluorescent dye. When a quencher is a fluorescent dye, only the absorption property of the dye is utilized. A second type of fluorescence quenching occurs via photo-induced electron transfer (PET), wherein the quencher is an electron-rich molecule that quenches the fluorescence of a fluorescent molecule by transferring an electron to the electronically excited dye. A third type of fluorescence quenching occurs via dye aggregation, such as H-dimer formation, wherein two or more dye molecules are in physical contact with one another, thereby dissipating the electronic energy into the vibrational modes of the molecules. This type of contact fluorescence quenching can occur between two identical fluorescent dyes, or between two different fluorescent dyes, or between a fluorescent dye and a FRET quencher, or between a fluorescent dye and a PET<br>
quencher. Other types of fluorescence quenchers, though not used as commonly, include stable free radical compounds and certain heavy metal complexes.<br>
[0047] Generally, the term "nucleic acid" refers to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), and/or derivatives thereof. A nucleic acid may be natural or synthetic.<br>
[0048] Generally, the term "fluorescent nucleic acid stain" or "fluorescent nucleic acid dye" refers to a dye capable of binding to a nucleic acid to form a fluorescent dye-nucleic acid complex. A fluorescent nucleic acid dye is typically non-fluorescent or weakly fluorescent by itself, but becomes highly fluorescent upon nucleic acid binding. Generally, the term "non-fluorescent, nucleic acid-binding molecule" refers to a nucleic acid-binding molecule that may or may not be a dye and that does not become fluorescent upon binding to nucleic acid. Generally, the term "fluorescent DNA dye" refers to a dye that becomes fluorescent upon binding to DNA. Generally, the term "fluorescent, non-nucleic acid dye" refers to a fluorescent dye that does not bind to nucleic acid. Generally, the term "non-fluorescent, non-nucleic acid dye" refers to a dye that is neither fluorescent nor nucleic acid-binding. Such a dye is commonly called a fluorescence quencher. Frequently, a fluorescence quencher is used to form a FRET pair with a fluorescent dye. Generally, the term "reporter dye" refers to a fluorescent dye whose emitted fluorescence contributes to the final detected fluorescence signal.<br>
[0049] Generally, the term "polymerase chain reaction" or "PCR" refers to a technique for amplifying the amount of DNA. Generally, the term "quantitative, real-time PCR" or "qPCR" refers to a technique to monitor the growing amount of DNA in the course of a PCR.<br>
[0050] In general, fluorescent nucleic acid dyes can be classified into two major classes: intercalators and minor groove-binders. Generally, fluorescent intercalators are dyes that bind to double-stranded DNA or double-stranded RNA by inserting themselves in between a neighboring base pair. Generally, minor groove-binders are dyes that bind to the minor groove of double-stranded DNA. There are still other dyes that may bind to nucleic acids via multiple modes, including electrostatic interaction between a positively charged dye and the negatively charged nucleic acid.<br>
[0051] Although a variety of fluorescent nucleic acid dyes have become commercially available, and methods for improving the dyes for non-qPCR uses have been developed, not all nucleic acid stains are suitable for qPCR application. Additionally, little is known as to what structural elements are required for a good qPCR dye.<br>
[0052] In general, from a performance point of view, an ideal dye for qPCR should meet various criteria, as now described. The dye should be thermally stable at high temperature (from about 60°C to about 96°C) in a PCR buffer and hydrolytically stable at low temperature (from about -20°C to about 4°C) when the media becomes alkaline. The dye should not inhibit the PCR process, this generally being the most important criteria, as in the most severe cases of PCR inhibition, the PCR process may not even start, and in milder cases, the Ct number may be delayed, or only a very low dye concentration may be used, such that the fluorescence signal is limited. The dye should be non-fluorescent or minimally fluorescent in the absence of DNA, but become highly fluorescent in the presence of DNA. The absorption and emission wavelengths of the dye should be compatible with instruments used in connection with qPCR, such as the existing instruments previously described. The DNA binding of the dye should have little or no sequence preference. The fluorescence intensity of the DNA-dye complexes should be linearly related to the amount of DNA present. A dye described herein may or may not meet one or more of the above-described criteria.<br>
[0053] A method for designing a fluorescent nucleic acid dye, such as one suitable for qPCR, for example, is provided. The method comprises covalently linking two or three monomeric dyes with a suitable linker to form a dimeric dye or a trimeric dye. A dye described herein, when in solution, may assume a predominantly hairpin-like conformation due to intramolecular dimer formation. This hairpin-like conformation or state of the dye is inactive with respect to nucleic acids, or incapable of interacting with nucleic acids. It is believed that the dye, when in solution and in the presence of nucleic acids, also assumes an open random conformation or state, which exists in small quantity and in substantial equilibrium with the hairpin conformation. The open random conformation or state of the dye is active with respect to nucleic acids, or capable of interacting or binding with nucleic acids. It is believed that when the dye is in the presence of an increasing amount of nucleic acids, an equilibrium shift from the hairpin state toward the intermediate, open random state, or DNA-binding state, occurs. It is believed that this<br>
mechanism, sometimes referred to as a "release-on-demand DNA-binding mechanism," reduces PCR inhibition that may otherwise be associated with the dye. As a consequence, the dye may be used in PCR processes at a higher concentration than might otherwise be possible, and thus, may provide for greater nucleic acid detection sensitivity than might otherwise be possible. The reduction in PCR inhibition may be dramatic, and the increase in nucleic acid detection sensitivity may be significant.<br>
[0054] A dimeric dye or trimeric dye described herein may posses any number of desirable characteristics. By way of example, such a dye may have a background fluorescence that is reduced relative to that of its monomeric dye constituents. Relatively low background fluorescence generally corresponds to relatively enhanced nucleic acid detection sensitivity. Thus, such a dye is generally associated with enhanced nucleic acid detection sensitivity. Further by way of example, a dye described herein may be more thermally and/or hydrolytically stable than SYBR Green I. Still further by way of example, a dye described herein may have absorption and emission wavelengths other than those associated with existing qPCR dyes.<br>
[0055] A fluorescent dimeric nucleic acid dye may have the general structure (Structure 1) set forth directly below.<br>
Structure 1<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
In Structure 1, independently, each dye of dye Q1 and dye Q2 is selected from a fluorescent nucleic acid dye, a non-fluorescent nucleic acid dye, a fluorescent non- nucleic acid dye, and a non-fluorescent non-nucleic acid dye. Q1 and Q2 may be selected and combined in a manner to encourage or to ensure desired properties of the resulting dimeric dye. At least one dye of dye Q1 and dye Q2 is a reporter dye. Further, at least one dye of dye Q1and dye Q2 is a fluorescent nucleic acid dye or a non-fluorescent nucleic acid dye. The reporter dye and fluorescent nucleic acid dye may be the same or different. BRIDGE may be positively charged to a relatively limited extent or substantially neutral in charge, and may be a substantially flexible constituent that facilitates intramolecular dimer formation to produce the dimeric dye.<br>
[0056] A fluorescent trimeric nucleic acid dye may have the general structure (Structure 2) set forth directly below.<br>
Structure 2<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 [0057] In Structure 2, independently, each dye of dye Q1 dye Q2, and dye Q3 is selected from a fluorescent nucleic acid dye, a non-fluorescent nucleic acid dye, a fluorescent non-nucleic acid dye, and a non-fluorescent non-nucleic acid dyes. Q1, Q2, and Q3 may be selected and combined in a manner to encourage or to ensure desired properties of the resulting trimeric dye. At least one dye of dye Q1, dye Q2, and dye Q3 is a reporter dye. Further, at least one dye of dye Q1, dye Q2, and dye Q3 is a fluorescent nucleic acid dye or non-fluorescent nucleic acid dye. The reporter dye and fluorescent nucleic acid dye may be the same or different. BRIDGE may be positively charged to a relatively limited extent or substantially neutral in charge, and may be a substantially flexible constituent that facilitates intramolecular dimer formation to produce the trimeric dye.<br>
[0058] A fluorescent nucleic acid dye may have the general structure (Structure 3) set forth directly below.<br>
Structure 3<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 [0059] In Structure 3, independently, each dye of dye Q1, dye Q2, may be as described above in relation to Structure 1 and Structure 2; BRIDGE may be a substantially aliphatic linker, as previously described; and Rr may be a reactive group or a functional group. Merely by way of example, Q1 may be a fluorescent nucleic acid dye constituent; Q2 may be a fluorescent nucleic acid dye constituent; BRIDGE may be a substantially aliphatic linker comprising from about 15 to about 150 non-hydrogen atoms and up to one positive charge; and Rr may be a reactive group or a functional group, as described herein.<br>
BRIDGE<br>
[0060] BRIDGE may be a substantially flexible linker molecule, having no more than one positive charge. BRIDGE may be a substantially neutral and substantially flexible linker molecule. The constituents of BRIDGE may be selected to achieve such a limited positive charge or such a substantial neutrality. The property of substantial neutrality, which includes actual neutrality, is discussed further below. The property of substantial flexibility is generally related to the substantially aliphatic nature, which includes actual aliphatic nature, of BRIDGE. This substantial aliphatic nature generally refers to the non-aromaticity of BRIDGE, or non-rigidity of BRIDGE.<br>
[0061] In Structure 1, BRIDGE is covalently attached to Qi and (fc. In the case of dimeric dyes, BRIDGE may have from about 8 to about 150 non-hydrogen atoms, from about 8 to about 100 non-hydrogen atoms, from about 12 to about 60 non- hydrogen atoms, or from about 15 or about 20 to about 40 or about 50 non-hydrogen atoms, for example. In Structure 2, BRIDGE is covalently attached to Q1 Q2 and Q3. In the case of trimeric dyes, BRIDGE may have from about 15 to about 150 non-hydrogen atoms, from about 20 to about 150 non-hydrogen atoms, from about 20 to about 100 non-hydrogen atoms, or from about 30 to about 70 non-hydrogen atoms, for example.<br>
[0062] BRIDGE may incorporate at least one independent nucleic-acid-binding- enhancing-group (NABEG). A NABEG is a moiety capable of binding to nucleic acids in the form of electrostatic, hydrophobic, or hydrogen-bonding interactions. Merely by way of example, a NABEG may be selected from primary amines; secondary amines; tertiary amines; ammoniums; amidines; aryl groups optionally comprising hetero atoms selected from N, O, S, and any combination thereof; moieties having bonds comprising hetero atoms of high electronegativity; and any combination thereof.<br>
[0063] Primary, secondary and tertiary amines and amidines are basic groups and therefore are positively charged or at least partially positively charged at physiological pH. Ammonium groups, or quaternized nitrogen groups, are permanently positively charged. Generally speaking, positively charged or partially positively charged groups enhance the nucleic acid binding of the dye via electrostatic interaction, a property that may be exploited in the development of highly<br>
sensitive fluorescent nucleic acid stains. It is generally undesirable to use BRIDGE having excessive positive charges to produce a dye of the present invention. For example, a suitable BRIDGE of a dimeric dye or a trimeric dye of the invention may comprise no more than one positive charge. BRIDGE may be a substantially flexible and neutral or substantially neutral linker. In this context, substantially neutrality refers to slight charge. By way of example, BRIDGE could comprise a weakly basic constituent, such as a pyridine group or a pyrazine group, for example, such that when it is in aqueous solution, a very small amount of positive charges may be present. Further by way of example, in a case (optional) in which BRIDGE comprises at least one neutral NABEG, the exact amount of positive charge may be generally related to the pKa of the NABEG. Generally, the higher the pKa of the NABEG, the more likely the NABEG is protonated and thus, positively charged. By way of example, a suitable weakly basic NABEG group may have a pKa of about 11 or less, about 8 or less, or about 7 or less.<br>
[0064] There may be a tendency to form an intramolecular dimer, primarily H-dimer, which may be a particularly useful property in the nucleic acid dye produced. For example, in the case of a dimeric dye described herein, H-dimer formation may produce a hairpin-like structure, wherein H-dimer forms a stem portion of the hairpin and BRIDGE forms a curved portion, as schematically illustrated in Figure 1. The phenomenon of H-dimer formation in connection with certain dyes has been described in West, et al, J. Phys. Chem. (1965); Rohatgi, et al, J. Phys. Chem. (1966); Rohatgi, et al, Chem. Phys. Lett. (1971); and Khairutdinov, et al, J. Phys. Chem. (1997). Formation of an intramolecular H-dimer may be facilitated when BRIDGE is a flexible and neutral or substantially neutral hydrocarbon linker, optionally comprising one or more neutral NABEG(s).<br>
[0065] H-dimer formation may be characterized by a large blue shift of the dye absorption spectrum. By way of example, the absorption spectra of a monomeric dye AO (acridine orange) and a related dimeric dye, AOAO-7, that forms an intramolecular dimer, are shown in Figure 2. The 471 nm peak associated with the AOAO-7 dimer indicates intramolecular H-dimer formation. The absorption spectra of both the monomer and the dimer become similar once DNA-binding occurs, indicating the opening up of the hairpin structure. By way of example, as shown in Figure 3, the disappearance of the 471 nm peak from AOAO-7 dimer indicates the opening up of the hairpin structure upon DNA binding.<br>
[0066] H-dimer formation in a dye described herein may be associated with two major benefits. One of the major benefits is a reduction, sometimes dramatic, in background fluorescence, coupled with a substantial increase in fluorescence upon DNA-binding, as demonstrated by a large gain in the fluorescence signal. This benefit may be appreciated by comparing the fluorescence spectra of a monomeric acridine orange dye, DMAO, and a dimeric acridine orange dye, AOAO-7, in the absence and presence of DNA. For example, as shown in Figure 4, relative to the monomeric DMAO dye, the dimeric AOAO-7 dye is associated with lower background fluorescence and higher fluorescence upon binding to DNA.<br>
[0067] Intramolecular dimer-associated fluorescence quenching may be so efficient that a dye described herein may be constructed from at least one monomeric dye that is not normally considered to be very desirable, such as at least one monomeric dye that has high background fluorescence, for example. An example of this is shown in Figure 4, which features acridine orange (AO) and a dimer thereof. Although AO is one of the earliest known nucleic acid-binding dyes and has desirable wavelengths, it has not been widely used for nucleic acid detection because of its relatively high background fluorescence. As demonstrated in Figure 4, relative to the monomeric AO dye, the dimeric dye AOAO-7 has much lower background fluorescence.<br>
[0068] H-dimer formation occurs via intramolecular, rather than intermolecular, interaction. The H-dimer formation occurs via the covalent linkage of two or three dyes, such as a pair of desirable monomeric dyes, for example. The H-dimer formation may be accomplished relatively easily, without the need for an additional reagent, such as an additional reagent that may interfere with a useful application of the dye, for example. By way of example, a dimeric dye may be formed from a pairing of one nucleic acid-binding dye constituent and one non-nucleic acid-binding fluorescent dye constituent in solution, without the use of an additional reagent. Further by way of example, a trimeric dye may be prepared from two nucleic acid- binding dye constituents and one non-nucleic acid-binding fluorescent dye constituent in solution, again, without the use of an additional reagent. The H-dimer formation provides a useful way to trap the dye in a non-DNA-binding state, which has no inhibitory effect on PCR and which shifts to the open random state or the DNA- binding state only when DNA is present. Thus, the effective dye concentration, or the concentration of the dye in the open random state, can be kept low, even though a high total dye concentration is used to increase the qPCR sensitivity.<br>
[0069] As mentioned above, H-dimer formation in a dye described herein may be associated with another major benefit. This unexpected benefit is that H-dimer formation in a dye may significantly reduce the inhibitory effect of the dye to PCR in a qPCR application. By way of example, usually, for a DNA sample of a given concentration, the fluorescent signal from a fluorescent DNA dye is proportional to the dye concentration, until dye saturation. By way of example, a higher dye concentration is associated with a greater formation of DNA-dye complexes, and thus, greater, or brighter, fluorescence, until dye saturation. Therefore, ideally, one would wish to start with a high enough dye concentration for maximal sensitivity in a qPCR application. In practice, however, all DNA dyes that have previously used for qPCR inhibit the DNA amplification process in varying degrees. Typically, a higher concentration of such a previous dye has been associated with greater dye inhibition of the amplification or PCR process. Thus, the concentration of such a previous dye has usually been made to be much lower for a qPCR application than it would be for a non-qPCR application.<br>
[0070] This lowering of dye concentration in qPCR applications results in a sacrifice in terms of end-point fluorescent signal strength, as may be discerned from the following discussion of the most widely used DNA dye for qPCR, S YBR Green I, by way of example. The concentration of SYBR Green 1 that used in qPCR is not provided by the manufacturer, such that precise comparison with other dyes is not easy or routine. However, as the concentration of a dye is linearly related to its optical density according to Beer's law, the optical density characteristics of SYBR Green 1 solution used in qPCR and another dye solution used in qPCR may be used to at least qualitatively compare the respective concentrations. For example, a typical optical density for SYBR Green 1 solution used in qPCR is from 0.025 to 0.05, while the optical density for a solution of Dye No. 19 of Table 2 herein used in qPCR is typically from about 0.04 to about 0.8, or more typically, from about 0.1 to about 0.4. The SYBR Green I dye shows a significant inhibition effect when the dye concentration is increased from 0.5X, which corresponds to an optical density of 0.025 at the absorption peak of 495nm, to a IX concentration, which corresponds to an optical density of 0.05 at the same absorption peak. As shown in Figure 8, while SYBR Green I at the IX concentration has a higher end-point fluorescent signal relative to SYBR Green I at the 0.5X concentration, the cycle number, or Ct value, associated with the IX dye concentration is delayed. This delayed Ct value indicates that SYBR Green I significantly<br><br>
inhibits PCR at higher dye concentration. The dimeric dye, AOAO-12, exhibits little or no inhibition when the dye concentration is increased from a IX dye concentration, which corresponds to an optical density of 0.1 at the absorption peak of 471nm, to a 2X dye concentration, which corresponds to an optical density of 0.2 at the same absorption peak. Because AOAO-12 shows little or no PCR inhibition, it can be used at a concentration that is relatively high and provide a fluorescent signal that can be several times higher than that of SYBR Green I, as shown in Figure 9. In brief, AOAO-12 shows little or no PCR inhibition within a wide concentration range, and thus can be used at a higher concentration for an increased fluorescent signal.<br>
[0071] It is believed that the above-described substantial lack of PCR inhibition that may be associated with dyes described herein, such that a higher dye concentration can be used, may be explained by a "release-on-demand" mechanism that is schematically illustrated in Figure 1. That is, it is believed that in solution, a dimeric dye exists in a dynamic equilibrium between a closed hairpin conformation and an open random conformation, as shown in Figure 1. In general, the hairpin conformation is much more stable than the open random conformation and is predominant. The dominance of the hairpin conformation of the dye is supported by ultraviolet/visible spectra, which show a substantial shift of the dimer spectrum relative to the monomer spectrum. The hairpin conformation is an inactive form of the dye, while the open conformation is an active form of the dye, capable of DNA binding. When DNA is present, dye in the open conformation shifts to a DNA-bound conformation, more dye in the hairpin conformation shifts to the open conformation, and dye in the open conformation stays at a very low concentration. In other words, the majority of the dye is trapped in the non-DNA-binding hairpin conformation and is only released to the open conformation, or the DNA-binding form, in response to greater DNA presence. This "release-on-demand" mechanism makes it possible for a dye to be used at a relatively high concentration without adversely affecting the PCR process itself. Unlike a dye described herein, SYBR Green I does not have a non-DNA-binding conformation that helps lower the effective concentration of the dye and thus shows a highly concentration-dependent PCR inhibitory effect.<br>
[0072] The nucleic acid stains described herein are relatively simple and can be prepared on a desirable scale, such as in amounts measured in grams to tens of grams, for example, on a fairly<br>
routine basis. These nucleic acid stains may be used fairly universally for detection of DNA amplification and for relatively routine research applications. By way of example, fluorescent nucleic acid dyes may be used to detect the presence and amount of DNA in a substantially non-sequence-selective manner, and in a relatively universal manner.<br>

[0075] A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, A9, and A10 may be the same or different, each, independently, being a nucleic-acid-binding-enhancing-group (NABEG); a branched alkyl optionally comprising at least one hetero atom selected from N, O and S; or at least one saturated 5- or 6-membered ring optionally comprising at least one hetero atom selected from N, O and S.

 [0078] The -(CH2)α' of Formula 3 is covalently linked to T of Formula 2 and A14 of Formula 3 is covalently linked to L3 of Formula 2. Independently, each of A11, A12, A13, and A14 may be a neutral or substantially neutral nucleic-acid-binding-enhancing- group (NABEG); a neutral branched alkyl optionally comprising at least one hetero atom selected from N, O and S; or at least one neutral saturated 5- or 6-membered ring optionally comprising at least one hetero atom selected from N, O and S, as described previously in connection with each of A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, A9, and A10 of Formula 1. The subscripts associated with the (CH2) methylene units,<br>
namely, α', ß, γ', and δ', may be the same or different, each independently indicating the size of the associated methylene unit and being zero or an integer from 1 to about 20. The subscripts associated with the bracketed portions of Formula 3, namely, a', b', and c', may be the same or different, each independently indicating the size of the associated bracketed portion and being zero or an integer from 1 to about 20.<br>
[0079] In Formula 2, independently, L3 may be a moiety comprising a single bond; a polymethylene unit having 1 carbon to about 12 carbons optionally comprising at least one hetero atom selected from N, O and S; or an aryl group optionally comprising at least one hetero atom selected from halogens, N, O and S, as described previously in connection with each of the L components of Formula 1. The resulting molecule is a trimeric nucleic acid stain.<br>
[0080] One of A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, A9, and A10 may be a branching unit covalently linked to a reactive group Rr through a branch B' and a linker L3, as shown in the formula (Formula 4) set forth directly below.<br>
Formula 4<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 [0081] In Formula 4, T, B' and L3 are defined as set forth above in connection with Formula 2 and Formula 3, with the exception that L3 is covalently bound to Rr. The resulting molecule may be a nucleic acid stain as represented by Structure 3 above.<br>
[0082] A dye with a reactive group -Rr can be used to label any of a wide variety of molecules that comprise a suitable functional group or are derivatized to comprise a suitable functional group. It is understood that the term "reactive group" can be used to refer to a "reactive group" or a "functional group" and that the term "functional group" can be used to refer to a "reactive group" or a "functional group." Either term may refer, and both terms may refer, to a bond-forming group on a dye, or to a bond- forming group on the substrate molecule to be labeled. Here, by way of convenience, but not limitation, a bond-forming group on the dye will generally<br>
be referred to as a reactive group and a bond-forming group on the substrate molecule will generally be referred to as a functional group. Merely by way of example, a dye with a reactive group or functional group -Rr may have up to one positive charge.<br>
[0083] In general, conjugation of a dye to a substrate molecule may confer a nucleic acid-detection property of the dye on the conjugated substrate molecule. The reactive group and the functional group are typically an electrophile and a nucleophile, respectively, that can form a covalent bond. According to one alternative, the reactive group is a photoactivatable group capable of reacting with a hydrocarbon molecule upon ultraviolet photoactivation or photolysis. According to another alternative, the reactive group is a dienophile capable of reacting with a conjugated diene via a Diels-Alder reaction. According to yet another alternative, the reactive group is a 1,3-diene capable of reacting with a dienophile. Still other reactive group/functional group pairs may be selected based on Staudinger chemistry or the reaction between an azido group and a terminal alkyne (the so-called Click chemistry). Merely by way of example, examples of useful reactive groups, functional groups, and corresponding linkages are listed below in Table 1.<br><br>

* Activated esters, as understood in the art, generally have the formula —COD, where D is a good leaving group, such as succinimidyloxy (—OC4H4O2), sulfosuccinimidyloxy (—OC4H3O2—SO3H), or -l-oxybenzotriazolyl<br>
(	OC6H4N3), for example; or an aryloxy group or aryloxy substituted one or<br>
more times by electron-withdrawing swbstituent(s), such as nitro, fluoro, chloro, cyano, trifluororoethyl, or combinations thereof, for example, used to form activated aryl esters; or a caiboxylic acid activated by a carbodiimide to form an anhydride or mixed anhydride —OCOR' or —OCNR*NHRb, where Raand Rb, which may be the same or different, are independently  C1-C6 alkyl, C1-C6 perfluoroalkyl, or  C1-C6 alkoxy; or cyclohexyl, 3-dimethylaminopropyl, or N-morpholinoethyl.<br>
** Acyl azides can also rearrange to isocyanates.<br>
[0084] The reactive group may be one that will react with an amine, a thiol, or an aldehyde. The reactive group may be an amine-reactive group, such as a succinimidyl ester, for example, or a thiol-reactive group, such as a maleimide, a haloacetamide, or a methanethio-sulfonate (MTS),<br>
for example, or an aldehyde-reactive group, such as an amine, an aminooxy, or a hydrazide, for example.<br>
[0085] A reactive dye may be conjugated to any of a wide variety of substrate molecules. For example, a suitable substrate may be a nucleotide, an oligonucleotide, a peptide, a protein, a hapten, a drug, a microparticle, a synthetic polymer, a natural polymer, a biological cell, a virus, a molecule of a solid surface, such as the surface of a silicon wafer, the surface of a polypropylene substrate or container, or the like, for example. A molecule to be labeled may be a nucleotide, an oligonucleotide, a peptide, or a molecule that may interact with a nucleic acid. For example, DNA-binding dyes have been used to label an oligonucleotide-based probe for qPCR applications. Shiguro, T., et al, Nucleic Acids Res. 24: 4992-7 (1996).<br>
[0086] A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, A9, and A10, which may be the same or different, may, independently, be NABEGs selected from moieties comprising at least one bond linkage that comprises at least one hetero atom of high electronegativity or S; and aryl groups optionally comprising at least one hetero atom selected from halogens, N, O, and S. Examples of moieties comprising at least one bond linkage that comprises at least one hetero atom of high electronegativity or S include, but are not limited to moieties comprising at least one amide bond, urethane bond, urea bond, thiourea bond, ether bond, or thioether bond. A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, A9, and A10 may be such that BRIDGE comprises at most one positive charge, or is substantially neutral, and in the latter case, each of these constituents may itself be substantially neutral, which includes actual neutrality.<br>
[0087] BRIDGE may comprise any suitable number of non-hydrogen atoms, as previously described, such as from about 10 to about 100 non-hydrogen atoms, for example, or from about 12 to about 60 non-hydrogen atoms for the dimeric dyes, and from about 20 to about 100 non-hydrogen atoms for the trimeric dyes. For example, BRIDGE may have from about 15 to about 40 non-hydrogen atoms for the dimeric dyes, and from about 30 to about 70 non-hydrogen atoms for the trimeric dyes.<br>
[0088] Merely by way of example, BRIDGE may have the formula (Formula 5) set forth directly below.<br>
Formula 5<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
In one such case, for example, LI of BRIDGE is -(CH2)xand L2 of BRIDGE is - (CH2)x-, where each x, independently, is an integer selected from 1 to 11, inclusive; A1 of BRIDGE is -Q=O)NH-; a of BRIDGE is 1; A2 of BRIDGE is -O-; A3 of BRIDGE is -O-; a may be an integer selected from 2 to about 20, inclusive; each of p and y, independently, may be 2 or 3; b may be zero or an integer selected from 2 to about 20; and c may be zero or 1 ; each of d, e, f, g, h and i of BRIDGE is 0; and A10 of BRIDGE is -NH(O=C)C-. Merely by way of example, BRIDGE may be as just described, wherein c is 1. Further, merely by way of example, BRIDGE may be as just described, wherein c is 1, and further, wherein x may be 5; a and y may be the same and may be 2 or 3; p may be 2; and b may be 0, 1, 2 or 3.<br>
Monomeric Dyes<br>
[0089] Independently, each of the constituent monomeric dyes or functional molecules, Ql, Q2, and Q3, used for the dimeric and trimeric dyes may be selected from: 1) fluorescent nucleic acid dyes; 2) non-fluorescent, nucleic acid-binding molecules; 3) fluorescent, non-nucleic acid dyes; and 4) non-fluorescent, non-nucleic acid dyes. In general, Ql, Q2 and Q3 may be selected and covalently linked via BRIDGE in a manner to encourage or to ensure intramolecular dimer formation in the absence of DNA and formation of highly fluorescent DNA-dye complexes upon DNA binding. Intramolecular dimer formation may be sufficient to provide the useful hairpin conformation of a dimeric dye, as previously described. Such a dimeric dye may possess desirable properties, such as low background fluorescence and low PCR inhibition, for example. As previously described, it is possible to use a dimeric dye as described herein at a relatively high concentration to generate a desirable, or strong, fluorescent signal.<br>
[0090] Intramolecular dimer formation may be confirmed by comparing the absorption spectra of a dimeric dye or trimeric dye in an aqueous solution with the absorption spectra of the related monomeric dye or dyes also in an aqueous solution. Any intramolecular dimer formation dye should cause the spectra of the component monomeric dyes in the dimer or trimer to be shifted significantly relative to the spectra of the related monomeric dye(s). In this regard, a significant<br>
shift may be about 10 nm or more, by way of example. For example, in Figure 2, the spectra associated with AOAO-7 are shifted significantly relative to the spectra of DMAO.<br>
[0091] When the intramolecular dimer formation is a H-dimer formation, the spectra will usually undergo a significant blue shift. In this regard, a significant shift may be about 10 nm or more, by way of example. Other types of intramolecular dimer formation are also possible and may result in spectral shift in another direction, in spectral shifts in separate directions for each of the component monomeric dyes, in an insignificant spectral shift, or in no spectral shift. In this regard, an insignificant shift may be about 5 nm or less, by way of example. In general, when there is no significant spectral shift observed, other analytical techniques may be employed to confirm the formation of any intramolecular dimer. Such analytical techniques include, but are not limited to, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and fluorescence spectroscopy, for example. Any intramolecular dye aggregation that results in a hairpin structure is generally desirable.<br>
[0092] Various combinations of Ql, Q2, and Q3 may be useful or desirable. Merely by way of example, a dimeric dye may be constructed via five different combinations of Ql and Q2, as schematically shown in Figure 10. Further by way of example, examples of prepared dyes and associated intermediates are listed below in Table 2.<br><br>
Table 2: Prepared Fluorescent Nudeic Acid Dyes<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
 [0093] While many of the structures shown in Table 2 show one or more iodide anion(s), any other appropriate anion(s), such as those described herein, such as chloride anion(s), merely by way of example, may be used in place of the iodide anions shown.<br><br>
[0094] A dimeric dye of the invention may comprise a fluorescent nucleic acid dye Q\ and a fluorescent nucleic acid dye Q2, wherein Q1 and Q2 may be the same or different. When Q1 and Q2are the same, the resulting dye is a homodimer, such as any of Dye Nos. 6-22, 24-26, and 28-36 of Table 2, merely by way of example. When Q1 and Q2 are different fluorescent nucleic acid dyes that have similar absorption and emission spectra, the resulting dimer is a heterodimer, such as that of Dye No. 23 of Table 2, merely by way of example. Such a heterodimer is functionally similar to a homodimer. In either case, both Q1and Q2 are reporter dyes, such that upon DNA binding, they both contribute to the detected fluorescent signal, as schematically illustrated in Combination A of Figure 10. Alternatively, a heterodimeric dye may comprise two different fluorescent nucleic acid dyes that have substantially different absorption and emission spectra. In this case, only one of the two dyes is selected as a reporter dye.<br>
[0095] Q1 and Q2 may form a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) pair. In this case, the dye with the shorter wavelength acts as a fluorescence donor dye, while the dye with the longer wavelength acts as an acceptor or reporter dye. For efficient FRET to occur, the emission spectrum and the absorption of the donor dye need to overlap sufficiently. Further discussions of FRET are provided in Forster, Ann. Phys. (1948) and Stryer, et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci (1967). A FRET-based dye allows for excitation at one wavelength and re-emission of fluorescence at a substantially longer wavelength.<br>
[0096] When a heterodimer comprising Q1 and Q2 of substantially different spectra is not a FRET-based dye, either one of Q1 and Q2, but not both at the same time, may be selected as a reporter dye. The other non-reporter dye serves as a partner for the necessary intramolecular dimer formation and provides additional nucleic acid binding ability for the dimeric dye. An example of a heterodimeric dye having one reporter dye, a fluorescent nucleic acid dye Q1, and one non-reporter dye, a non-fluorescent nucleic acid-binding molecule Q2, is schematically illustrated in Combination B of Figure 10.<br>
[0097] A heterodimeric dye may comprise a non-fluorescent nucleic acid-binding molecule Q1 and a fluorescent non-nucleic acid dye Q2. Here, Q2is the reporter dye, while Q1 serves as a DNA anchoring dye and a pairing partner for the necessary intramolecular dimer formation. The<br>
DNA binding mode for this type of heterodimer is schematically illustrated in Combination C of Figure 10.<br>
[0098] A heterodimeric dye may comprise a fluorescent nucleic acid dye Q1 and a non-fluorescent non-nucleic acid dye Q2. In such a case, Q1 is the reporter dye and Q2 serves as a partner for the necessary intramolecular dimer formation. The DNA binding mode for this type of heterodimer is schematically illustrated in Combination D of Figure 10.<br>
[0099] A heterodimeric dye may comprise a fluorescent nucleic acid dye Q1 and a fluorescent non-nucleic acid dye Q2. If Q1 and Q2 have similar absorption and emission spectra, both Q1 and Q2 are reporter dyes, although only Q1 is bound to the nucleic acids. The DNA binding mode for this type of heterodimer is schematically illustrated in Combination E of Figure 10. When Q1 and Q2 form a FRET pair, the dye with the shorter wavelength acts as the fluorescence donor dye, while the dye with the longer wavelength acts as the acceptor or reporter dye. When Q1 and Q2 are substantially different in spectra and are not a FRET pair, either one of Q1 and Q2, but not both at the same time, may be selected as a reporter dye. An example of this latter case is the heterodimer AORO-7 (Dye No. 27 of Table 2), which comprises AO with an absorption peak and an emission peak at 503nm and 523nm (DNA), respectively, and a rosamine dye with an absorption peak and an emission peak and at 600nm and ~620nm, respectively, as shown in Figures 12 and 13. Figure 14 shows a PCR amplification plot using AORO-7, with the fluorescent non-nucleic rosamine dye component chosen as the reporter dye by using channel no. 3 on an iCycler 1Q Multiple-Color Real-Time PCR Detection System from Bio-Rad Laboratories (Hercules, CA).<br>
[0100] A dimeric dye may comprise a pair of monomeric dyes selected from two identical fluorescent nucleic acid dyes and two different fluorescent nucleic acid dyes.<br>
[0101] A trimeric dye may comprise a fluorescent nucleic acid dye Q1, a fluorescent nucleic acid dye Q2, a fluorescent nucleic acid dye Q3, wherein Q1 Q2, and Q3 may be the same or different. For example, Q1, Q2, and Q3 may be the same fluorescent nucleic acid dye. A trimeric dye may comprise a fluorescent nucleic acid dye Q1, a fluorescent nucleic acid dye Q2, and a fluorescent non-nucleic acid dye Q3, wherein Q1 and Q2 serve as DNA anchoring molecules and Q3 is a<br>
reporter dye. A trimeric dye of the invention may comprise a non-fluorescent nucleic acid-binding molecule Q1, a non-fluorescent nucleic acid-binding molecule Q2, and a third fluorescent non-nucleic acid dye Q3, wherein Q1 and Q2 serve as DNA anchoring molecules and Q3 is a reporter dye.<br>
[0102] Fluorescent nucleic acid dyes, non-fluorescent nucleic acid-binding molecules, fluorescent non-nucleic acid dyes, non-fluorescent non-nucleic acid dyes, and examples thereof, are further described below.<br>
Fluorescent nucleic acid dyes<br>
[0103] Examples of a monomeric fluorescent nucleic acid dye suitable for constructing dyes include, but are not limited to, an acridine dye, an asymmetric cyanine-based nucleic acid stain, a phenanthridinium dye, a symmetric cyanine nucleic stain, a derivative of DAPI, and a derivative of a Hoechst dye. DAPI and Hoechst dyes generally cannot be directly attached to BRIDGE because they do not possess a reactive group for bond formation. In this context, a derivative refers to a base dye, such as DAPI or a Hoechst dye, that is modified sufficiently for bond formation, such as by addition of a reactive group, by way of example.<br>
Acridine Dyes<br>
[0104] Merely by way of example, the monomeric fluorescent nucleic acid dye may be an<br>
acridine dye having the general structure (Structure 4) set forth directly below.<br>
Structure 4<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
[0105] Acridine orange (AO) is an acridine dye that stains dsDNA with green fluorescence and stains RNA with red fluorescence. Traganos, et al, J. Histochem. Cytochem. 25(1), 46 (1977). Unlike some other acridine dyes, AO has a high extinction coefficient (&gt;50,000) and a long absorption wavelength (λ,abS - 500 run (DNA bound)). However, the affinity of AO for nucleic acid is very low and the dye has significant intrinsic fluorescence in the absence of nucleic acids.<br>
In this regard, the level of intrinsic fluorescence may be significant in that it precludes the dye from being used in detecting nucleic acid at a low level, such as in the low nanogram/mL range, for example, or in detecting nucleic acid in gels without a destaining step, for example. Consequently, AO itself is of little utility for DNA or RNA quantification, particularly for highly sensitive DNA detection associated with applications such as real-time qPCR.<br>
[0106] An acridine dye may comprise any of a variety of substituents at various positions on the ring structure. The nature of a substituent and its substitution position may strongly affect the spectral properties of the dye produced. In general, electron- donating substituents at the 3- and 6-positions and an electron-withdrawing substituent at the 9-position typically red-shift the absorption and emission spectra of the dye. Examples of a typical electron-donating group include, but are not limited to, an amino group, a hydroxyl group, an alkoxy group, and an alkylmercapto group. Examples of a typical electron-withdrawing group include, but are not limited to, a cyano group, a perfluoroalkyl group, a carboxamido group, a sulfonamide group, a nitro group, and a halogen group. Any additional ring structure fused with the core structure will also increase the wavelengths of the dye produced.<br>
[0107] Various portions of Structure 4 are now described. In Structure 4, as in various other monomeric dye structures provided or described herein, a symbol of "R" followed by a subscript, such as R1, merely by way of example, may indicate a substituent of the structure that is not part of BRIDGE, or may represent where BRIDGE attaches to the structure, in which case, it is not a substituent of the structure. Each R1, independently, may be H; an alkyl or alkenyl having 1 carbon to 6 carbons; a halogen; -ORt; -SR5; -NR6R7; -CN; -NH(C=O)R8; -NHS(=0)2R9; or -C(=O)NHR1o; any adjacent pair of RIS optionally forms a 5- or 6-membered saturated or unsaturated ring, which further optionally comprises at least one hetero atom selected from N, 0 and S; and one of the R1s is -L-Rr, as previously described, or one of the R1S represents where BRIDGE attaches to the structure, in which case, that R1 is merely representative and not actually a substituent of the monomeric dye. In any case where R1 involves at least one of R4, R5 R6, R7, R8, R9, and R10, any applicable one of same is independently H or an alkyl having 1 carbon to 6 carbons, and for any applicable pair of adjacent R6 and R7, independently, R6 and R7 may in combination form a 5- or 6-membered saturated or unsaturated ring, which optionally comprises at least one hetero atom selected from N and O.<br>
[0108] Typically, R2 is H; an alkyl or alkenyl having 1 carbon to 6 carbons; an aryl optionally comprising at least one hetero atom selected from halogens, N, O and S; a halogen; -OR11; -SR12; -NHR13; -CN; or -C(=O)NHRi4; or represents where BRIDGE attaches to the structure. In any case where R: involves at least one of R11, R12, R13 and R14, any applicable one of same is independently H or alkyl having 1 carbon to 6 carbons.<br>
[0109] Typically, R3 is H; or an alkyl having 1 carbon to 6 carbons; or represents where BRIDGE attaches to the structure.<br>
[0110]Ψis an anion, such as an anion that balances positive charge(s) associated with the dye, for example. Ψ may be biologically compatible. Examples of a suitable anion include, but are not limited to, a halide, a sulfate, a phosphate, a perchlorate, a tetrafluoroborate, and a hexafluorophosphate. Merely by way of example, the anion may be chloride or iodide.<br>
[0111] Only one of R1, R2 and R3 must represent where BRIDGE attaches to the structure. Merely by way of example, one of R2 and R3 may represent where BRIDGE attaches to the structure. As described herein, BRIDGE may be covalently linked to a monomeric acridine dye, such as any such dye described herein, and to another suitable monomeric dye, to form a dimeric dye, or to two other suitable monomeric dyes to form a trimeric dye. Generally, only one of 1, R2 and R3 may be optionally -L-Rr, as previously described. A dimeric dye or a trimeric dye may comprise only one -L-Rr.<br>
[0112] Merely by way of example, the monomeric acridine dye may have the structure (Structure 5) set forth directly below.<br>
Structure 5<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
[0113] In Structure 5, generally, each R1, independently, is H, or a C1-C2 alkyl; one of R2 and R3 represents where BRIDGE attaches to the structure; optionally, one of R2 and R3 is -L-Rr, as<br>
previously described; when R2 does not represent where BRIDGE attaches to the structure and is not L-Rr, R2 is selected from H, -CH3, -NH2, - NHCH3, -CN, and C(=O)NH2; when R3 does not represent where BRIDGE attaches to the structure and is not L-Rr, R3 is selected from H or -CH3; each of R6 and R7, independently, is H, or a C1-C2 alkyl; and Ψ is an anion, as previously described. Merely by way of example, for each pair of adjacent R6 or R7 and R1, independently, R6 or R7 and R1may in combination form a 5- or 6-membered, saturated or unsaturated ring.<br>
[0114] In one example, the monomeric acridine dye, as represented by Structure 5, may be such that each R1 is H; R2 is H; R3 represents where BRIDGE attaches to the structure; each R6 is -CH3; each R7 is -CH3; and Ψ is an anion, as previously described.<br>
[0115] Merely by way of example, a dimeric dye may comprise two identical monomeric acridine dye molecules of Structure 5 and BRIDGE of Formula 5.<br>
Asymmetric cyanine dyes<br>
[0116] Merely by way of example, the monomeric fluorescent nucleic acid dye may be an<br>
asymmetric cyanine dye having the general structure (Structure 6) set forth directly below.<br>
Structure 6<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 [0117] The general structure (Structure 6, above) of asymmetric cyanine dyes comprises a heterocyclic ring that is a substituted benzazolium ring; a methane or polymethine bridge; and a heterocyclic ring that is a substituted pyridinium or quinolinium ring. The dotted line in the structure represents the atoms necessary to form one or more fused aromatic ring(s), optionally incorporating one or more nitrogen(s), which may or may not be quaternized. When the dotted line represents a 6-membered ring comprising one or more nitrogen atom(s), the resulting fused ring is called an aza-benzole ring.<br>
[0118] In Structure 6, in general, each of R1 and R1 on the benzazolium ring, independently, is H; alkyl or alkenyl having 1 carbon to 6 carbons; a halogen; -OR9- SR10; -NRnR12; -CN; -<br>
NH(OO)R13; -NHS(=O)2R14; or -Q=O)NHR15. Merely by way of example, one of R1 and R1 may be a substituent that is meta to X or to the benzazole nitrogen, wherein the substituent confers at least one desirable property as further described below. In any case where R1or R1' involves at least one of R9, R10, R11, R12, R13, R14 and R15 any applicable one of same, independently, is H; or alkyl having 1 carbon to 12 carbons, optionally incorporating 1 to 2 nitrogen(s); or an aryl; and any applicable R11 and R12 may in combination form a 5- or 6-membered saturated or unsaturated ring, which optionally comprises at least one hetero atom selected from N and O.<br>
[0119] As mentioned above, one of R1 and R1 of Structure 6 may be a substituent that confers at least one desirable property to the dye. One such desirable property is DNA minor groove-binding. A minor groove-binding molecule typically has a structure with a crescent shape that fits into the minor groove of a double-stranded DNA. Examples of a DNA minor groove-binding dye molecule or non-dye molecule, which may include a natural molecule, include, but are not limited to, DAPI, a Hoechst dye, distamycin A, netropsin, and any of numerous synthetic minor groove- binders based on polyamides of N-methylpyrrole and N-methylimidazole. Catalog of Biotium, Inc. (Hayward, California (CA)), 2005-2006; Boger, et al, Ace. Chem. Res. 37, 61 (2004); and Dervan, P.B., Bioorg. &amp; Med. Chem. 9, 2215 (2001). The crescent shape of a minor groove-binder is typically created by meta -substitution of a 5- or 6- membered ring with a minor groove-binder substituent, which includes, but is not limited to, a substituted or an unsubstituted benzoxazol-2-yl, a substituted or an unsubstituted benzimidazol-2-yl, a substituted or an unsubstituted benzothiazol-2-yl, a substituted or an unsubstituted imidazol-2-yl, a substituted or an unsubstituted oxazol- 2-yl, a substituted or an unsubstituted thiazol-2-yl, a substituted or an unsubstituted N-methylpyrrolyl-2-aminocarbonyl, a substituted or an unsubstituted N-methylpyrrolyl-3-carboxamido, a substituted or an unsubstituted l-methylimidazol-2-carboxamido, a substituted or an unsubstituted l-methylimidazol-4-aminocarbonyl, a substituted or an unsubstituted phenyl, a substituted or an unsubstituted pyridyl, a substituted or an unsubstituted pyrazinyl, and a substituted or an unsubstituted triazinyl. A DNA dye may be meta-substituted by a minor groove-binder substituent as described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004/0132046.<br>
[0120] One of R1 and R1 may be -L-Rr, as previously described. One of R1 and R1 may represent where BRIDGE attaches to the structure.<br>
[0121] X is selected from O and S. In general, a dye wherein X is S has longer absorption and emission wavelengths than a similar dye wherein X is O.<br>
[0122] R2 may be methyl or ethyl, or may represent wherein BRIDGE attaches to the structure. Merely by way of example, R1 may be methyl or ethyl.<br>
[0123] The subscript n represents a number of double bond units in any methine bridge and is selected from 0, 1, and 2. Typically, a dye with a longer methine bridge will have longer wavelengths than a dye with a shorter methine bridge. Merely by way of example, n may be 0 or 1.<br>
[0124] Substitutents R3, R4, and R5 are independently H or -CH3. Optionally, any adjacent pair of these substitutents may form a 5- or 6-membered ring. Merely by way of example, R3, R4, and R5 may be H.<br>
[0125] In general, independently, each of substituents R6, R8, and R8' may be H; an alkyl or alkenyl having 1 carbon to 10 carbons, optionally comprising at least one hetero atom selected from N, 0, and S; a halogen; -OR16; -SR16; -NR16R17; a substituted or unsubstituted aryl, optionally comprising 1 to 3 hetero atom(s) selected from halogens, N, O, and S. R8and R8' may in combination form a fused aromatic ring, which may be further substituted 1 to 4 time(s), independently, by C1-C2 alkyl, C1-C2 alkoxy, C1-C2 alkylmercapto, or a halogen. In any case in which any of R6, R8, and R8 involve at least one of R16 and R17, any applicable one of same, independently, is H; or alkyl having 1 carbon to 12 carbons, optionally incorporating 1 to 2 nitrogen(s); or an aryl; and any applicable R16 and R17 may in combination form a 5- or 6-membered saturated or unsaturated ring, which optionally comprises at least one hetero atom selected from N and O.<br>
[0126] R6 may represent where BRIDGE attaches to the structure. R6 may be a -L-Rr, as previously described.<br><br>

 [0133] Merely by way of example, a dimeric dye may comprise two identical monomeric asymmetric cyanine dye molecules of Structure 8 and BRIDGE of Formula 5.<br>
[0134] Merely by way of example, in a fluorescent nucleic acid dye, such as that of Structure 1, for example, when the Ql dye constituent is an asymmetric cyanine dye, such as any of Structures 6-8, for example, and the Q2 dye constituent is an asymmetric cyanine dye, such as any of Structures 6-8, for example, a sum of a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, and i of BRIDGE, such as BRIDGE of Formula 1, for example, may be greater than three, or at least one of A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, A9, and A10 of BRIDGE, such as BRIDGE of Formula 1, for example, may be a NABEG comprising a moiety that comprises at least one bond linkage that comprises at least one amide bond, urethane bond, urea bond, or thiourea bond; or an aryl optionally comprising at least one hetero atom selected from halogens, N, O, and S.<br>

 [0136] In general, RI may represent where BRIDGE attaches to the structure, although it will be understood that many variations of Structure 9 above are possible and contemplated herein, via a variety of techniques, such as synthesis techniques that may provide for the attachment of BRIDGE to the structure elsewhere or that may modify the structure to provide a dye with any of various desirable wavelengths, Ψ is an anion, as previously described.<br>
[0137] Merely by way of example, two monomeric phenanthridiniurn dye molecules of Structure 9 in combination with BRIDGE of Formula 5 may form a dimeric dye.<br>
[0138] Merely by way of example, the monomeric fluorescent nucleic acid dye may be a xanthene derivative, having the general structure (Structure 10) set forth directly below.<br>
Structure 10<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 [0139] Certain cationically charged xanthene dyes are known to bind to nucleic acids. For example, pyronin Y, in which R1 R2, R1', and R2( are methyl and R3, R3', R4, R4, and A are H, is a known fluorescent DNA binding dye that has been used for DNA gel staining. Adkin, S., and Burmeister, M., Anal. Biochem. 240(1), 17(1996). A dye having the general skeleton shown in Structure 10 above is expected to have similar nucleic acid staining properties and to provide other fluorescent colors. For example, pyronin Y has an absorption maximum at 548nm and an emission maximum at 565nm, providing a red fluorescent color.<br>
[0140] Merely by way of example, in general, each of R1, R2, R1', and R2', independently, may be H, or C1-C6, inclusive, alkyl, optionally incorporating 1 to 2 hetero atom(s) selected from N and O. Further merely by way of example, independently, at least one of the pair R1 and R2 and the pair R1 and R2  may in combination form a 5- or 6-membered ring, optionally comprising one hetero atom selected from N and O. R1 and R1 may be the same and R2 and R.2 may be the same.<br>

[0145] Ψ  is an anion, as previously described.<br>
[0146] Two monomeric xanthene dye molecules of Structure 10 in combination with BRIDGE of Formula 5 may form a dimeric dye.<br>
[0147] Other monomeric fluorescent nuclei acid stains, such as DAPI, DIPI, a Hoechst dye, LDS 751, hydroxystilbamidine, a styryl dye, a merocyanine dye, a cyanine dye, or FluoroGold, merely by way of example, may be suitable for use or may be derivatized to be suitable for use as described herein. Haugland, R.P., Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Products, 9th edition. It will be understood that a large number of other monomeric nucleic acid dyes may be suitable for use or may be derivatized to be suitable for use as described herein. The dyes may either be directly conjugated to BRIDGE or be derivatized so that they can be conjugated to BRIDGE using synthesis knowledge.<br>
[0148] Non-Fluorescent Nucleid Acid Dyes<br>
[0149] In general, non-fluorescent nucleic acid-binding molecules are nucleic acid- binding molecules that are non-fluorescent or are too weakly fluorescent to be useful as fluorescent nucleic acid dyes. Non-fluorescent nucleic acid-binding molecules include non-fluorescent nucleic acid-binding dyes and colorless synthetic or natural nucleic acid-binding molecules.<br>
[0150] A number of non-fluorescent dyes have been used as colorimetric nucleic acid gel stains. Relative to the fluorescent nucleic acid stain ethidium bromide, these non- fluorescent dyes usually have much lower detection sensitivity, but are considered to be safer to use, such as safer in terms of toxicity for use by humans, for example. Examples of non-fluorescent nucleic acid-binding dyes include, but are not limited to, Nile Blue, Crystal Violet, Methylene Blue, Thionin, Methyl Green, Basic Blue 66, Basic Red 29, Indoline Blue, Safranin O, Janus Green B,<br>
Pinacyanol, and Stains-All. Adkins, et al, Anal. Biochem. 240, 17 (1996). Most of these dyes are available from Aldrich Chemical Company, Inc. (Milwaukee, Wisconsin).<br>
Fluorescent non-nucleic acid dyes<br>
[0151] One of the monomeric dyes Q1, Q2, and Q3 may be a fluorescent non-nucleic acid dye. In general, all fluorescent dyes that are not normally considered fluorescent nucleic acid dyes are considered fluorescent non-nucleic acid dyes. Herein, the term "fluorescent non-nucleic acid dye" generally refers to a fluorescent dye that is not normally considered a nucleic acid dye. By way of example, the dye may not normally be considered a fluorescent minor groove-binder or a fluorescent intercalator. Further by way of example, while some fluorescent non-nucleic acid dyes may exhibit some weak interactions with nucleic acids, these interactions are generally not sufficient to cause significant fluorescence spectral changes to make the dyes useful for nucleic acid detection.<br>
[0152] Various fluorescent non-nucleic acid dyes are commercially available from various sources, such as Biotium, Inc. (Hayward, CA). Examples of a fluorescent non-nucleic acid dye include, but are not limited to, a fluorescein dye, a sulfonated fluorescein dye, a rhodamine dye, a sulfonated rhodamine dye, a cyanine dye, a sulfonated cyanine dye, a coumarine dye, a pyrene dye, an oxazine dye, and a Bodipy dye (Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR)). A suitable fluorescent non-nucleic acid dye may comprise a reactive group Rr, as previously described. A suitable fluorescent non-nucleic acid dyes may be derived such that it comprises a reactive group RI-. A suitable reactive dye is covalently attached to BRIDGE via Rr and a suitable functional group from BRIDGE.<br>
[0153] Selection of a suitable fluorescent non-nucleic acid dye may depend on the other pairing monomeric dye or dyes. In general, a suitable fluorescent non-nucleic acid dye should be able to form an intramolecular dimer with the pairing dye or dyes. Intramolecular dimer formation is typically confirmed by a significant change in the absorption spectrum of at least one of the component monomeric dyes in an aqueous media before and after the monomeric dye is covalently linked to the other pairing monomeric dye or dyes by BRIDGE.<br>
Non-fluorescent non-nucleic acid dyes<br>
[0154] In general, the term "non-fluorescent non-nucleic acid dye" refers to a dye that is neither fluorescent nor nucleic acid-binding. Such a dye is generally used as a fluorescence quencher in a FRET-based application. By way of example, a fluorogenic peptidase substrate has been constructed by covalently attaching a fluorescent donor dye to one end of a peptide, and a non-fluorescent non-nucleic acid dye, the quencher, to the other end of the peptide to quench the fluorescence of the donor. Upon enzymatic cleavage of the peptide, the donor and the quencher are separated, thereby releasing the fluorescence signal. Further by way of example, a non-fluorescent non-nucleic acid dye has been used to design so-called TaqMan probes for qPCR. A TaqMan probe consists of an oligonucleotide, which is complimentary to a target DNA sequence, a fluorescence donor dye attached to one end of the oligonucleotide, and a quencher attached to the other end of the oligonucleotide to quench the fluorescence of the donor dye. During real-time PCR, the labeled oligonucleotide binds to the target DNA, which causes the oligonucleotide to be enzymatically cleaved, thereby generating a fluorescent signal.<br>
[0155] A non-fluorescent non-nucleic acid dye may be used mainly as a pairing partner for intramolecular dimer formation, which is responsible for the release-on- demand DNA-binding mechanism. The non-fluorescent non-nucleic acid dye should be so chosen to ensure minimal FRET between it and the fluorescent nucleic acid- binding dye it pairs with following DNA binding. In general, fluorescence loss of the fluorescent nucleic acid dye due to FRET should be minimal, such as no more than about 70% of the total emitted fluorescence, for example. The selection of the non- fluorescent non-nucleic acid dye may be based on an evaluation of the emission spectrum of the fluorescent nucleic acid-binding dye and the absorption spectrum of the non-fluorescent dye. Ideally, these spectra should have minimal overlap so that the fluorescence signal loss due to FRET is minimal, as described above. Another possible way to minimize FRET is to use sufficiently long BRIDGE so that the fluorescence signal loss due to FRET is minimal, as described above, as the efficiency of FRET is dependent on the inverse sixth power of the intermolecular separation between the constituent dyes.<br>
[0156] Examples of commercially available non-fluorescent quenchers which may be useful include, but are not limited to, DABCYL from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland), Black Hole Quencher (BHQ) from Biosearch Technologies, Inc. (Novato, CA), Eclipse Dark Quencher (DQ)<br>
from Epoch Biosciences (Bothell, Washington), IOWA Black (IWB) from Integrated DNA Technologies (Skokie, Illinois), and QSY from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR).<br>
Method of Use<br>
[0157] A nucleic acid dye described herein may be particularly useful in quantitative real-tune PCR (qPCR). Using PCR coupled with fluorescence-based DNA detection via a fluorescent nucleic acid dye, one may determine the amount of a product of a PCR process without having to stop a PCR run or to sample the reaction during a PCR run. Using qPCR, one may not only quantify the original amount of a DNA sample, but may also obtain sequence information. The sensitivity and specificity of qPCR makes it highly useful in a number of practical applications including the diagnosis and prognosis of diseases, and the identification of species in agriculture and forensic science.<br>
[0158] The use of a dye in qPCR may involve adding a solution of the dye and other components suitable for a PCR reaction (such as an amplification enzyme or enzymes, a primer or primers sufficient for amplification of the target nucleic acid sequence, and deoxynucleoside triphosphates, for example) to a solution comprising a DNA sample in a tube, placing the sealed tube in a qPCR instrument, and recording the detected fluorescent signal. The Ct value, or the number of cycles required for the fluorescence signal to reach an arbitrarily determined threshold value, may be recorded. The Ct value is linearly related to the log of the DNA sample copy number. Using a standard plot of Ct value and the log of DNA copy number, one can determine the DNA copy number of a DNA sample based on the Ct value. Merely by way of example, PCR amplification plots using selected dyes are shown in Figures 8,9,11, and 14.<br>
[0159] Other uses of a fluorescent nucleic acid dye include, but are not limited to, DNA quantitation in solutions or gels, staining of nucleic acids in live or dead cells, and nucleic acid detection in microarrays. Generally, the use of a fluorescent nucleic acid dye may comprise contacting the dye, optionally in combination with any additional reagent(s), with a sample that comprises or is thought to comprise a nucleic acid polymer; incubating the resulting mixture of dye and sample for a sufficient amount of time to allow formation of dye-nucleic acid complexes; and detecting the fluorescent signal of the dye-nucleic acid complexes.<br>
[0160] The dye may be prepared for suitable use as described herein. Merely by way of example, the dye may be made into a stock solution using an aqueous solvent or a water-miscible and biologically compatible organic solvent at a concentration of greater than about 100 times that used in the final staining solution. Examples of suitable aqueous solvents that may be used alone or in combination with a suitable organic solvent in the making of a dye stock solution, include, but are not limited to, water, PBS buffer, and Tris buffer. Examples of suitable organic solvents for the making of a dye stock solution, include, but are not limited to, DMSO, DMF, methanol or ethanol. The stock solution is then diluted into a staining solution with a desired final dye concentration using a suitable aqueous solvent, such as water or a biological buffer, for example. In general, the specific dye concentration for the staining solution may be determined by the nature of the sample to be analyzed and the nature of the analysis being performed. By way of example, in general, a staining solution for use in conection with a cellular sample may have a dye concentration of about InM or more, or up to about lOOµM. Further by way of example, in general, a staining solution for use in connection with an electrophoretic gel may have a dye concentration of about lµM or more, or up to about 50µM.<br>
[0161] A method of staining nucleic acids using a dye may be determined by the nature of the analysis being carried out. In the staining of nucleic acids in cellular or tissue samples, which may or may not be pre-fixed, the samples are usually incubated in a staining solution for a few minutes to 2 hours to allow the dye to permeate the cell membranes and combine with the nucleic acids. In some cases, nucleic acids may be present in the form of a solution comprising purified nucleic acids or crude cell extracts. In such cases, in general, addition of a dye stock solution to a nucleic acid solution should result in an instantaneously detectable fluorescence signal, the strength of which is proportional to the amount of nucleic acid. By way of example, a DNA titration curve is shown in Figure 7. The substantially linear relationship between the amount of DNA and fluorescence intensity can be used for quantitation of DNA, or when cell extract is used, estimation of the number of cells. In certain instances, a nucleic acid may be embedded in an inert matrix, such as a blot or gel, a test strip, for example, or attached to a solid surface, such as a microarray chip or any other solid surface, for example. In such cases, in general, staining is carried out by applying a staining solution to the surface of the nucleic acid-<br>
comprising matrix, or to the surface of a microarray chip or other solid surface, and incubating for a period sufficient to allow formation of dye-nucleic acid complexes.<br>
[0162] A fluorescent nucleic acid-dye complex may be detected either via its emission or excitation. By way of example, the fluorescent nucleic acid-dye complex may be, and typically is, excited by a light with wavelength at or near the absorption maximum wavelength of the complex. Further by way of example, the nucleic acid- dye complex may be excited by UV light with wavelength from 300 nm to 400nm, which is a common source of excitation light available on most of the transluminators used for gel visualizing applications. By way of example, the fluorescent signal may be detected via various instruments, such as plate readers, microscopes, fluorometers, quantum counters, and flow cytometers, for example. Further by way of example, the fluorescent signal may be made by visual methods, such as visual inspection or photographic recording, for example.<br>
Synthesis<br>
[0163] The synthesis of a dye may be described in terms of synthesis of the monomeric dye constituents, synthesis of BRIDGE, and conjugation of the monomeric dye constituents to BRIDGE. Syntheses of monomeric dyes and monomeric dyes comprising a functional group or a reactive group are now described.<br>
Synthesis of the monomeric dves and functional molecules<br>
[0164] Suitable monomeric dyes and monomeric dyes comprising a functional group or a reactive group may be prepared from scratch by a known procedure or any suitable procedure, or by modifying commercially available material that already has a suitable or desirable core structure. Many monomeric acridine dyes may be prepared from commercially available acridine dyes. A few examples of a commercially available acridine dye that may serve as suitable starting material for synthesis are set forth directly below.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 [0165] Other acridine core structures may be prepared according to known procedures or any suitable procedures. Albert, A., The acridities: their preparation, physical, chemical, and biological properties and uses, Edward Arnold Ltd., London; Eldho, et al., Synth. Commun. 29, 4007 (1999); and Joseph, et al, Bioconjugate Chem. 15, 1230 (2004). An acridine core structure may be formed by condensing a suitable diphenylamine with a suitable carboxylic acid or a carboxylic acid equivalent in the presence of a Lewis acid, as schematically illustrated in Reaction 1 directly below.<br>
[0166] Reaction 1<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 [0167] In Reaction 1, R', R" and R'" are suitable substituents, as further described below. The diphenylamine starting material is either commercially available or may be synthesized from a suitable arylhalide and a suitable arylamine using a known method or any suitable method. Yang, etal, J. Organomet. Chem. 576, 125 (1999); Hartwig, et al, J. Org. Chem. 64, 5575 (1999); and Wolfe, etal, J. Org. Chem. 65, 1158 (2000).<br>
[0168] The nature of the substituents and the position where the substituents are attached may have a profound effect on the spectral property of the dye. In general, electron-donating groups at the 2-, 3-, 6- and 7- positions will increase the absorption and emission wavelengths of the dye. A typical electron-donating group may be an amino group, an alkylamino group, a dialkylamino group, a hydroxyl group, an alkoxy group, a thiol group, or an alkylthio group, by way of example. A more typical electron-donating group may be an amino group, an alkylamino group, a dialkylamino group, or an alkoxy group, by way of example. In general, an electron-withdrawing group at the 9-position will increase the absorption and emission wavelengths of the dye. A typical electron- withdrawing group may be a cyano group, a perfluoroalkyl group, an aminocarbonyl group, an alkylaminocarbonyl group, an alkylcarbonyl group, an aldehyde group, an alkoxycarbonyl group, an aminosulfonato group, an alkylaminosulfonato group, or a halide<br>
group, by way of example. A more typical electron-withdrawing group may be a cyano group, a perfluoroalkyl group, or a halide group.<br>
[0169] In general, once the acridine core structure is built, the 10-nitrogen is alkylated with a haloalkyl group, which typically comprises an additional reactive group or a functional group that can be converted to a reactive group. The additional reactive group serves to conjugate the acridine dye to BRIDGE. Several ways of making monomeric acridine orange dyes with a suitable reactive group are schematically illustrated in Scheme 1 directly below.<br>

 [0170] The 9-position of 10-alkylated acridine may be readily substituted with a cyano group, which can be further hydrolyzed to a carboxamide group, as schematically illustrated in Scheme 2 directly below.<br><br>

[0171] Methods of preparing reactive monomeric asymmetric cyanine dyes have been described. Carreon, et a/., Org. Lett. 6(4), 517 (2004). Such a dye may have the structure (Structure 11) set forth directly below.<br>
Structure 11<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br><br>
[0172] U.S. Patent No. 5,863,753 discloses the preparation of a series of reactive asymmetric cyanine dyes, including ones that have a substituent ortho to the quinolinium or pyridinium nitrogen. Such a substituent, especially a cyclic substituent, ortho to the quinolinium or pyridinium nitrogen, is said to confer desired properties to the asymmetric cyanine dyes, according to U.S. Patent No. 5,436,134. These cyclically substituted asymmetric cyanine dyes are commonly referred to as SYBR dyes. Zipper, et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 32(12), e!03 (2004). Some of the reactive SYBR dyes are commercially available from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR), although the exact structures of these dyes are not known. Haugland, R.P., Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Chemicals, 9th edition.<br>
[0173] U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004/0132046 discloses methods for preparing monomeric asymmetric cyanine dyes with minor groove-binding capability. In general, these dyes possess a crescent-shaped structure by virtue of having an additional benzazolyl substitutent<br>
on the benzazolyl ring of the dyes. Similar monomeric dyes having a suitable reactive group may be prepared using similar methods, for example, as schematically illustrated in Scheme 3 directly below.<br>

 [0177] Many monomeric non-fluorescent nucleic acid-binding dyes are known pigments used in textile and ink industries and are commercially available. References for preparations of these dyes can be found in the literature. Many suitable reactive monomeric fluorescent non-nucleic acid dyes and non-fluorescent non-nucleic acid dyes are commercially available or may be prepared readily using known methods.<br>
Synthesis of BRIDGE<br>
[0178] BRIDGE is usually formed when the monomeric dyes are coupled to a bi- or tri-functional group, which is often commercially available. In general, the terminal portions of BRIDGE are from the monomeric dyes themselves, while the middle portion of BRIDGE is from a bi- or tri-functional molecule available from a commercial source. In some cases, a significant portion of BRIDGE, such as up to about 90%, for example, may be pre-attached to the monomeric dyes prior to the final assembly of the dimeric or trimeric dye. In some other cases, most of BRIDGE may be prepared separately before the monomeric dyes are attached. In the case of heterodimer synthesis, a mono-protected bi-functional linker group is usually first attached to one monomeric dye, followed by de-protection and coupling to the second monomeric dye. Hetero trimeric dyes may be synthesized using a similar step wise protection-de-protection strategy.<br>
Conjugation of the monomeric dyes to BRIDGE<br>
[0179] In general, dimeric and trimeric dyes may be assembled by conjugating monomeric dyes having a suitable reactive group with a bi- or tri-functional linker in a one-step coupling reaction for some of the homodimers, or in multi-step reactions for heterodimers and trimers or some of<br>
the homodimers comprising multiple bridge element A. Examples of synthetic routes to selected homodimer and heterodimers are schematically illustrated in Scheme 6 directly below.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1: Preparation of 10-(3-Iodopropyl)acridine orange, iodide<br>
[0182] One equivalent of 1,3-diiodopropane was added to a suspension of 5g of acridine orange (Aldrich) in 10 mL of chlorobenzene. The resulting mixture was stirred at 90-100°C overnight. The hot reaction mixture was poured into ~200mL of EtOAc. The orange precipitate was collected by filtration and dried under vacuum, yielding ~8g.<br>
Example 2: Preparation of 10-(5-Carboxypentyl)acridine orange, chloride salt [0183] 10-(5-Ethoxycarbonylpentyl)acridine bromide was prepared using the procedure of Example 1, with the exception that 1,3-diiodopropane was replaced with ethyl 6-bromohexanoic acid. The crude product (5g) was suspended in ~100mL methanol and 3 equivalents of NaOH dissolved in 30mL H2O. The suspension was stirred at room temperature for 24 h. Methanol was removed by evaporation, and the remaining aqueous solution was acidified with concentrated HC1. About 50mL saturated NaCl was added to precipitate the product.

Example 42: Absorbance and fluorescence of DMAO and AOAO-7<br>
[0223] The absorbance spectra, as shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3, and fluorescence emission spectra, as shown in Figure 4, of DMAO and AOAO-7, were measured separately without DNA presence, or with DNA presence (2mg/ml of salmon sperm DNA), in PBS buffer. All dye concentrations were adjusted to provide an optical density of 0.05 at 495 nm. The spectra were normalized to 1 in the absorbance plot. Relative to DMAO, AOAO-7 exhibits a new shorter wavelength peak at 471 nm in absorbance, indicating aggregation of the two acridine monomers within AOAO-7. Upon binding to DNA, absorbances of AOAO-7 and DMAO showed 5nm- and l0nm-red shifts, respectively, relative to free dyes. The fluorescence of free AOAO-7 is about 5 times lower than that of DMAO. The lower background fluorescence of AOAO-7 is advantageous in real time qPCR. The fluorescence per acridine monomer of AOAO-7 is close to that of DMAO, indicating that two monomers of AOAO-7 no longer quenched each other when bound to DNA and the linker between the two did not exhibit negative effect on the quantum yield.<br>
Example 43: Absorbance spectra of TOTO-1 and TOTO3<br>
[0224] In a similar manner to that described in connection with Example 42, the absorbance spectra of TOTO-1 and TOTO-3 were measured without DNA presence, as shown in Figure 5, or in the presence of 2mg/ml of salmon sperm DNA, as shown in Figure 6, in PBS buffer. As shown in Figure 5, the spectra of the free dyes indicate that TOTO-3, which has BRIDGE that is neutral or substantially devoid of positive charges, forms an intramolecular H-dimer, or a hairpin structure, while TOTO-1, which has multiple positive charges, has less spectral shift. As shown in Figure 6, the absorption spectra of both TOTO-1 and TOTO-3 in the presence of DNA shift to about the same position, indicating that the hairpin structure of TOTO-3 dimer opens up upon binding to DNA, and that both TOTO-1 and TOTO-3 form similar types of DNA-dye complexes.<br>
Example 44: Fluorescence of AOAO-12 in response to different amount of DNA [0225] The fluorescence of 0.1 µM AOAO-12 in 200mL of PBS in the presence of 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0 and 10 µg/ml final concentrations of salmon sperm DNA or a mixture of single-stranded 20mer oligonucleotide were measured on a microtiter plate reader (SpectraMax of Molecular Devices Corporation (Sunnyvale, CA)). The fluorescence was plotted<br>
against DNA concentration, as shown in Figure 7. It can be seen that fluorescence linearly responded to DNA up to 2.0µg/ml (inset). At higher concentrations of DNA, the response became non-linear. AOAO-12 fluoresces more intensely when bound to double stranded DNA than when bound to single stranded DNA.<br>
Example 45: Comparing signal strengths of AOAO-12 and SYBR Green I in qPCR [0226] This example demonstrates the superior property of AOAO-12 to SYBR Green I in fluorescence signal strength in qPCR. All real-time amplifications were performed in 20µL reaction solution comprising l0mM Tris (pH 8.0), 50mM KC1, 3.5mM MgC12, 2mM each of dNTP, and 1 unit of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (ABI, Foster City, CA) and various concentrations of a fluorescent monitoring dye. An ATPB fragment (SEQ ID NO: 1) in pTOPO plasmid was amplified with O.SuM forward primer 5'-GAGGTCTTCACAGGTCATA-3' (SEQ ID NO: 2), O.5µM reverse primer 5'-CTCTTCAGCCAGCTTATC-3' (SEQ ID NO: 3). The thermal regimen was set at 95°C for 1 minute followed by 50 cycles of 15-second duration at 95°C, of 15-second duration at 55°C, and of 15-second duration at 72°C, Fluorescence was measured at the 55°C stage. Consistent with an earlier report (Nath, K., et al, Effects of ethidium bromide and SYBR Green I on different polymerase chain reaction systems, J. Biochem Biophys Methods 42, 15 (2000)), SYBR Green I exhibited inhibition to PCR reactions, as shown in Figure 8, where Ct was delayed at higher SYBR Green I concentrations. Relative to SYBR Green I concentrations, higher concentrations of AOAO-12 could be added to reactions without exhibiting inhibition. As a result, the final fluorescence strength with AOAO-12 could be several folds higher, allowing for more sensitive detection. Alternatively, with AOAO-12, a less sensitive optical device could be used in thermal cycling fluorometers, leading to less expensive instruments.<br>
Example 46: Titration of Human Genomic DNA<br>
[0227] Amplifications of a UBC fragment (SEQ ID NO: 8) from human genomic DNA were performed under conditions similar to those set forth in Example 45, with either SYBR Green I (final absorption peak at 495nm corresponds to an optical density of 0.025, or A495 = 0.025) or AOAO-12 (final A495 = 0.1), except that (1) different forward and reverse primers sets (5'-ACTGGTAAGACCATCACC-3' (SEQ ID NO: 9) and 5'-GCAATGAAATTTGTTGAA-3' (SEQ ID NO: 10)) were used, and (2) a series of 10-fold dilutions of human DNA served as the<br>
templates. Figure 8 shows amplification plots of the reactions starting with 105 copies of human DNA down to 10 copies either with SYBR Green I or with AOAO-12. The inset shows that the Ct value is reversibly correlated with the logarithm of starting copy number monitored with both dyes. AOAO-12 is evidently superior to SYBR Green I in signal strength.<br>
Example 47: TO, TOTO-1 and TOTO12 in qPCR<br>
[0228] This example demonstrates the improved property of TOTO-12 over TO (thiazole orange, an asymmetric cyanine dye), or TOTO-1 in qPCR. All real-time amplifications were performed as in Example 5, except that TO, TOTO-1 and TOTO- 12 were used. As shown in Figure 11, TOTO-1 completely inhibited the PCR reaction, while TOTO-12 gave improved Ct and improved fluorescence intensity relative to TO in qPCR. The TOTO-12 dimeric dye is superior to each of the TO and TOTO-1 dyes.<br>
Example 48: Absorbance and fluorescence of AORO-7<br>
[0229] In a manner similar to that described in connection with Example 42, the absorbance spectra of AORO-7 were taken alone or in the presence of 2ng/ml of salmon sperm DNA in PBS buffer, as shown in Figure 12. The emission spectra of AORO-7 bound to DNA are shown in Figure 13. The heterodimeric dye AORO-7 comprises a monomeric AO dye and a fluorescent non-nucleic acid rosamine RO dye. Two emission peaks, contributed by AO and RO moieties, respectively, were recorded. It was possible to record qPCR with AORO-7 in Channel 1 with the excitation set at 490nm and the emission collected at 530nm, or Ex490/Em530, or in Channel 3 with Ex580/Em630, on a Chromo4 from Bio-Rad Laboratories (Hercules, CA), but only weakly in Channel 2 (Ex520/Em570) (data not shown). As the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) effect is negligible, either monomeric dye constituent, AO or RO, can be chosen as the reporter dye.<br>
Example 49: Heterodimer dye AORO-7 in qPCR<br>
[0230] The example demonstrates the utility of AORO-7 in qPCR. Real time amplifications were performed as in Example 5, except that AORO-7 with an optical density of 0.025 at 600nm in the final solution was used. As shown in Figure 14, AORO-7 may be used effectively be used to monitor the qPCR reaction course and to detect the melting curve of the amplicon (inset). The finding that this qPCR was monitored in Channel 3 (Ex580/Em630) on an iCycle IQ Multiple-<br>
Color Real-Time PCR Detection System from Bio-Rad Laboratories (Hercules, CA) provides an example that almost any dye of desirable wavelength may be tailored into a DNA reporter dye in qPCR by methods disclosed herein, thus widening the spectral use for qPCR monitoring. At present, most TaqMan probes use FAM or VIC, which occupy the same channels of SYBR Green I. It would be advantageous to use a sequence- specific-probe, such as a TaqMan probe, and a sequence-non-specific dye of different wavelength, such as AORO-7, in qPCR, wherein the probe provides sequence specificity and the dye provides other parameters of the amplicon, such as melting temperautres.<br>
Example 50: Melting peaks monitored with AOAO-12<br>
[0231] SYBR Green I was reported to be advantageous in that the melting temperature of an amplicon could be detected after qPCR amplification. The melting temperature provides valuable information about the amplicon, as it is a function of the size and GC content of the amplicon. No melting temperatures could be collected from TaqMan reactions. Melting curves from four amplicons, i.e., HMBS (SEQ ID NO: 4), RPL4 (SEQ ID NO: 5), SDHA (SEQ ID NO: 6), and TBP (SEQ ID NO: 7) were measured from reactions amplified in the presence of AOAO-12 (Panel A) or SYBR Green (Panel B) and are presented in Figure 15. The melting peaks collected with AOAO-12 correlated well with those collected with SYBR Green I. As AOAO-12 binds DNA with high affinity but less tightly than SYBR Green I, melting temperatures from AOAO-12 are about 2 degrees lower than those from SYBR Green I. As higher concentrations of AOAO-12 could be used in real time PCR reactions, melting peaks are markedly higher. The data demonstrate the relative utility of AOAO-12.<br>
[0232] It has been reported that qPCR reactions with SYBR Green I tend to form primer-dimers, and the tendency is closely related to the concentration of SYBR Green I. It has been postulated that SYBR Green I binds to DNA so tightly that it interferes with the performance of Taq DNA polymerase. As AOAO-12 has less affinity to DNA, the interference should be alleviated. This property of AOAO-12 is evident from Figure 15, in that the HMBS amplification reaction in the presence of SYBR Green I has an extra primer dimer peak, while the same amplification in the presence of AOAO-12 exhibits only a single, clean, and specific peak.<br>
Example 51: Stability of AOAO dyes<br>
[0233] The stability of dimeric dyes comprising monomeric AO was demonstrated. Specifically, AOAO-12 was kept in PCR reaction buffers with PCR products. The mixture was heated to 96°C for 40 minutes. During the heating course, the mixture was brought down to 60°C briefly to monitor the fluorescence. As shown in Figure 16, AOAO-12 is stable at 96°C for 40 minutes substantially without loss of fluorescence. The data demonstrate the robustness of AOAO-12 in PCR.<br>
Example 52: Preparation of TOTO-13 (Dye No. 29 of Table 2)<br>
[0234] The dye (102mg) was prepared using the procedure to synthesize AOAO-2 (Dye No. 7 of Table 2) from N-carboxypentyl thiazole orange (102mg, 0.23mmole) (Example 31) and 4,7,10-trioxa-l,13-tridecanediamine (23mg, 0.1 mole).<br>
Example   53:   Preparation   of  N-(5-carboxypentyl)-4-(4-(dimethylamino)styryl)   pyridinium<br>
bromide<br>
[0235]   A  mixture  of 4-N,N-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde   (3g,   20mmoles),  N-(5-carboxy-<br>
pentyl)picolinium bromide (5.6g, 20mmoles) and piperidine (2mL) in ethanol (lOOmL) was<br>
heated at 60 °C overnight. The mixture was evaporated to dryness in vacuo. The residue was<br>
redissolved in methanol and then precipitated with ether to give the product (6.7g).<br>
[0236] Example 54: Preparation of STST-19 (Dye No. 31 of Table 2)<br>
[0237] The dye (85mg) was prepared using the procedure to prepare AOAO-2 (Example 7) from N-(5-carboxypentyl)-4-(4-(dimethylamino)styryl)pyridinium bromide (Example 53) (200 mg, O.Smmole) and 2,2'-oxybis(ethylamine) dihydrochloride (36mg, 0.2mmoles).<br>
Example 55: Preparation of STST-27 (Dye No. 30 of Table 2)<br>
[0238] The dye (81.8mg) was prepared using the procedure to prepare AOAO-2 (Example 7) from N-(5-carboxypentyl)-4-(4-(dimethylamino)styryl)pyridinium bromide (Example 53) (200 mg, 0.5mmole) and 4,7,10-trioxa-l,13-tridecanediamme (44mg, 0.2mmoles).<br>
