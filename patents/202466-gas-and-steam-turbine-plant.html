The invention relates to a gas and steam turbine plant with a waste-heat steam generator which is located downstream of the gas turbine on the flue-gas side and the heating surfaces of which are connected into the water/steam circuit of the steam turbine, and with a fuel gasification device located upstream of the combustion chamber of the gas turbine via a fuel line.<br>
A gas and steam turbine plant with integrated gasification of fossil fuel conventionally comprises a fuel gasification device which is connected on the outlet side to the combustion chamber of the gas turbine via a number of components provided for gas purification. In this case, the gas turbine may have downstream, on the flue-gas side, a waste-heat steam generator, the heating surfaces of which are connected into the water/steam circuit of the steam turbine. A plant of this type is known, for example, from GJB-A-2,234,984 or from US, 4 , 697 , 4 15 .<br>
An apparatus for the removal of sulfur-containing constituents is provided, in both plants, for reliable purification of the gasified fossil fuel. In the plant known from GB-A-2,234,984, a saturator for inerting the fuel gas is located downstream of this apparatus in a supply line for the gasified fuel which opens into the combustion chamber, the gasified fuel being laden with steam in this saturator in order to reduce the pollutant emission. For this purpose, the gasified fuel flows through the saturator in countercurrent to a water stream which is carried in a water circuit designated as a saturator circuit. Here, in order to operate the saturator independently of the gas generation or gas purification plant, there is provision for feeding heat from the water/steam circuit into the saturator circuit.<br><br>
-3-<br>
This plant is intended to operate with gasified coal or gasified refinery residues - for example, residual oil - as fossil fuel and is therefore also adapted to the process properties for the gasification of coal or of residual oil with a view to achieving particularly high efficiency. In this case, the plant is designed in terms of the water/steam circuit of the steam turbine, particularly with a view to cost-effective and operationally reliable utilization of the heat occurring during gasification.<br>
The object on which the invention is based is to specify a gas and steam turbine plant of the type mentioned above, in which, along with a particularly simple design, both high plant efficiency and independent and simple-to-regulate  operation of the apparatus for inerting the fuel gas are ensured, even when oil is used as fossil fuel.<br>
This object is achieved, accordinq to the invention, in that a heat exchanger is connected on the primary side into the fuel line, as seen in the direction of flow of the gasified fuel, upstream of a mixing apparatus for admixing nitrogen to the gasified fuel, said heat exchanger being designed on the secondary side as an evaporator for a flow medium and being connected on the steam side to the combustion chamber of the gas turbine.<br>
The invention is based, here, on the notion that for high plant efficiency, even when oil is used as fossil fuel, particularly effective utilization of the heat carried in the fuel stream flowing off from the gasification device and also designated as crude gas should be provided. At the same time, precisely when oil is used as fossil fuel, it should be remembered that a large part of the crude-gas heat may occur in the form of latent heat as a result of partial water condensation at comparatively low temperature. It is precisely this heat which can be extracted from the crude-gas stream in a particularly advantageous way by the evaporation of a<br><br>
4<br>
flow medium, the flow medium being capable of being fed into the plant process at a suitable point in a particularly simple and flexible way. In addition, and for the inerting system for the fuel gas to operate independently of the water/steam circuit of the steam turbine located downstream of the gas turbine, with a suitable choice of the pressure level the steam generated can be fed directly as inerting medium to the fuel gas or to the GT burner. In this case, via the heat exchanger, particularly favorable operating parameters, in particular a particularly favorable temperature level, of the crude gas can be established for the subsequent mixing of the crude gas with nitrogen, this mixing being intended for the purpose of adhering to particularly low NOx limit values.<br>
Supplying the steam generated in the heat exchanger into the fuel stream makes it possible fully to ensure that the gasified fuel is laden with steam sufficiently to adhere to even low pollutant emission limit values, so that complicated devices normally provided for loading the gasified fuel with steam may be dispensed with completely. In particular, the gas and steam turbine plant of this type can be designed so as to dispense with the saturator normally provided, together with the further components assigned to it, so that a particularly simple design is obtained. Moreover, feeding the evaporated flow medium into the combustion chamber of the gas turbine ensures that the heat extracted from the crude gas during the evaporation of the flow medium is utilized particularly effectively for the plant process. The apparatus also allows simple and operationally reliable regulation of the steam content of the fuel gas in order to adhere to the predetermined limit values for NOx emission.<br>
Expediently, at the same time, the heat exchanger is designed as a medium-pressure evaporator for water as the flow medium. In this case, the heat exchanger is designed preferably for evapnratina the water at a pressure stage of about 20 to 25<br><br>
5<br>
bar. Thus, medium-pressure steam generated in this way and not required to be fed into the combustion chamber can also be utilized in a particularly advantageous way for the plant process and may, for example, be fed into the water/steam circuit of the steam turbine.<br>
The  heat  exchanger  is  at  the  same  time expediently also connected to a low-pressure stage of the water/steam circuit of the steam turbine on the steam side via a branch line, into which a shut-off member and a throttle apparatus are connected. In this case, the gas and steam turbine plant may be designed in such a way as to ensure that a steam quantity which is sufficient for adhering to predetermined pollutant emission limit values and which is to be supplied to the fuel is produced in every operating state. Thus, after throttling, possibly excess steam generated in the heat exchanger can be utilized directly for energy generation  in  order  to  achieve  particularly  high efficiency in the low-pressure stage of the water/steam circuit.  Conversely,  if the NOx emission requirements are particularly stringent, additional medium-pressure steam from the water/steam circuit may also be admixed, preferably upstream of the intermediate superheater of the waste-heat boiler.<br>
In a further advantageous refinement, the heat exchanger for medium-pressure steam generation has downstream of it a further heat exchanger for low-pressure steam generation, so that the maximum fraction of crude-gas heat at low temperature can be utilized with high efficiency, the generated steam, together with the throttled medium-pressure steam, being capable of being delivered to the low-pressure part of the water/steam circuit. A further heat exchanger for cooling the crude gas may be provided, depending on the gas purification requirements, in particular the temperature level of possibly downstream COS hydrolysis.<br>
In a further advantaqeous refinement, for particularly high plant efficiency, a crude-gas waste-<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
heat  steam  generator  precedes  the  medium-pressure evaporator in the<br><br>
7<br><br><br>
fuel line upstream of the heat exchanger. By means of the crude-gas waste-heat steam generator, it is possible for the crude gas or synthesis gas generated in the gasification device to be precooled as required and in a way which is advantageous in material terms.<br>
The advantages achieved bv means of the invention are, on the one hand, in particular, that, even when oil is used as fossil fuel, particularly high overall efficiency of the plant can be achieved. Utilizing the heat which is carried in the crude gas and which may, in particular, take the form of latent heat at a comparatively low temperature level in order to evaporate the flow medium makes it possible to supply this heat into the plant process in a particularly effective and flexible way. Particularly when water is evaporated as the flow medium and this steam is subsequently fed into the mixed gas, it becomes possible for the mixed gas to be sufficiently laden with steam, even without connecting a saturator which per se, together with the further components assigned to it, would entail a significant outlay in terms of manufacture and assembly. On the other hand, admixing the steam makes it possible to set the degree of saturation of the fuel gas over a wide parameter range and to have a simple and quick-reacting concept for regulating the steam content. This ensures that even low limit values for pollutant emission are adhered to at particularly low outlay.<br>
An exemplary embodiment of the invention is<br>
explained in more detail with reference to accompanying drawing in  which the figure shows diagrammatically a gas and steam turbine plant.<br>
The gas and steam turbine plant 1 according to the figure comprises a gas turbine plant la and a steam turbine plant lb. The gas turbine plant la comprises a gas turbine 2 with a coupled air compressor 4 and a combustion chamber 6 which is located upstream of the gas turbine 2 and which is connected to a compressed-air line 8 of the<br><br>
compressor 4. The gas turbine 2 and the air compressor 4 as well as a generator 10 are seated on a common shaft 12.<br>
The steam turbine plant lb comprises a steam turbine 20 with a coupled generator 22 and, in a water/steam circuit 24, a condenser 2 6 located downstream of the steam turbine 2 0 as well as a waste-heat steam generator 30. The steam turbine 20 consists of a first pressure stage or high-pressure part 20a, of a second pressure stage or medium-pressure part 20b and of a third pressure stage or low-pressure part 20c which drive the generator 22 via a common shaft 32.<br>
In order to supply working medium AM or flue gas expanded in the gas turbine 2 into the waste-heat steam generator 30, a waste-gas line 34 is connected to an inlet 30a of the waste-heat steam generator 30. The expanded working medium AM from the gas turbine 2 leaves the waste-heat steam generator 30 via its outlet 30b in the direction of a chimney which is not illustrated in any more detail.<br>
The waste-heat steam generator 30 comprises a condensate preheater 40 which is capable of being fed with condensate K from the condenser 26 on the inlet side via a condensate line 42, into which a condensate-pump unit 44 is connected. The condensate preheater 40 is connected on the outlet side to a feedwater tank 46 via a line 45. Moreover, in order, as required, to bypass the condensate preheater 40, the condensate line 4 2 may be connected directly to the feedwater tank 4 6 via a bypass line not illustrated. The feedwater tank 46 is connected via a line 47 to a high-pressure feed pump 48 with medium-pressure extraction.<br>
The high-pressure feed pump 48 brings the feedwater S flowing out of the feedwater tank 46 to a pressure level  suitable for the high-pressure  stage<br><br>
50 of the water/steam circuit 24, said high-pressure stage being assigned to the high-pressure part of the steam turbine 20. The feedwater S, which is under high pressure, can be supplied to the high-pressure stage 50 via a feedwater preheater 52 which is connected on the outlet side to a high-pressure drum 58 via a feedwater line 56 capable of being shut off by means of a valve 54. The high-pressure drum 58 is connected, for the formation of water/steam recirculation 62, to a high-pressure evaporator 60 arranged in the waste-heat steam generator 30. In order to discharge fresh steam F, the high-pressure drum 58 is connected to a high-pressure superheater 64 which is arranged in the waste-heat steam generator 30 and which is connected on the outlet side to the steam inlet 66 of the high-pressure part 20a of the steam turbine 20.<br>
The steam outlet 68 of the high-pressure part 20a of the steam turbine 20 is connected via an intermediate superheater 70 to the steam inlet 72 of the medium-pressure part 20b of the steam turbine 20. The steam outlet 74 of said medium-pressure part is connected via an overflow line 7 6 to the steam inlet 7 8 of the low-pressure part 20c of the steam turbine 20. The steam outlet 80 of the low-pressure part 20c of the steam turbine 20 is connected via a steam line 82 to the condenser 26, so that a closed water/steam circuit 24 is obtained.<br>
Moreover, a branch line 84 branches off from the high-pressure feed pump 48 at an extraction point at which the condensate K has reached a medium pressure. This branch line is connected via a further feedwater preheater 86 or medium-pressure economizer to a medium-pressure stage 90 of the water/steam circuit, said medium-pressure stage being assigned to the medium-pressure part 20b of the steam turbine 20. For this purpose, the second feedwater preheater 86 is connected on the outlet side to a medium-pressure drum 96 of the medium-pressure stage 90 via a feedwater line 94 capable of being shut off by means of a valve 92.<br><br>
- 10 -<br>
The medium-pressure drum 96 is connected, to form water/steam recirculation 100, to a heating surface 98 arranged in the waste-heat steam generator 30 and designed as a medium-pressure evaporator. In order to discharge medium-pressure fresh steam F', the medium-pressure drum 96 is connected via<br><br>
- 11 -<br>
a steam line 102 to the intermediate superheater 70 and therefore to the steam inlet 72 of the medium-pressure part 20b of the steam turbine 20.<br>
A further line 110 provided with a low-pressure feed pump 107 and capable of being shut off by means of a valve 108 branches off from the line 47 and is connected to a low-pressure stage 120 of the water/steam circuit 24, said low-pressure stage being assigned to the low-pressure part 20c of the steam turbine 20. The low-pressure stage 120 comprises a low-pressure drum 122 which, to form water/steam recirculation 126, is connected to a heating surface 124 arranged in the waste-heat steam generator 3 0 and designed as a low-pressure evaporator. In order to discharge low-pressure fresh steam F" , the low-pressure drum 122 is connected to the overflow line 76 via a steam line 128, into which a low-pressure superheater 129 is connected. The water/steam circuit 24 of the gas and steam turbine plant 1 thus comprises three pressure stages 50, 90, 120 in the exemplary embodiment. Alternatively, however, fewer, in particular two, pressure stages may also be provided.<br>
The gas turbine plant la is designed to operate with a gasified synthesis gas SG which is generated by the gasification of a fossil fuel B. Gasified oil is provided as synthesis gas in the exemplary embodiment. For this purpose, the combustion chamber 6 of the gas turbine 2 is connected on the inlet side to a gasification device 132 via a fuel line 130. Oil as fossil fuel B can be supplied to the gasification device 132 via a charging system 134.<br>
In order to provide the oxygen O2 required for gasifying the fossil fuel B, an air separation plant 138 is located upstream of the gasification device 132 via an oxygen line 136. The air separation plant 138 is capable of being loaded on the inlet side with a part stream T of the air compressed in the air compressor 4. For this purpose, the air separation plant 138 is connected on the inlet side to an extraction air line<br><br>
-12-<br>
140 which branches off from the compressed-air line 8 at a branch point 142. Moreover, a further air line 14 3, into which an additional air compressor 144 is connected, opens into the extraction air line 140. In the exemplary embodiment, therefore, the total air stream L flowing into the air separation plant 138 is composed of the part stream T branched off from the compressed-air line 8 and of the air stream conveyed by the additional air compressor 144. A set-up concept of this type is also designated as a partly integrated plant concept. In an alternative embodiment, the so-called fully integrated plant concept, the further air line 143, together with the additional air compressor 144, may also be dispensed with, so that the air separation plant 138 is fed air completely via the part stream T extracted from the compressed-air line 8.<br>
The nitrogen N2 obtained, in addition to the oxygen O2, in the air separation plant 138 during the separation of the air stream L is supplied to a mixing apparatus 14 6, via a nitrogen line 145 connected to the air separation plant 138, and there is admixed with the synthesis gas SG. In this case, the mixing apparatus 14 6 is designed for particularly uniform strand-free mixing of the nitrogen N2 with the synthesis gas SG.<br>
The synthesis gas SG flowing off from the gasification device 132 first passes via the fuel line 130 into a crude-gas waste-heat steam generator 147, in which cooling of the synthesis gas SG takes place by heat exchange with a flow medium. High-pressure steam generated during this heat exchange is supplied to the high-pressure stage 50 of the water/steam circuit 24 in a way which is not illustrated in any more detail.<br>
A soot-washing<br><br>
- 13 -<br>
apparatus  14 8  for  the  synthesis  gas  SG  and  a desulfliration plant 14 9 are connected into the fuel line 130  downstream  of  the  crude-gas  waste-heat  steam generator 147 and upstream of the mixing apparatus 14 6, as seen in the direction of flow of the synthesis gas SG.<br>
A heat exchanger 150 is connected on the primary side into the fuel line 130 between the soot-washing apparatus 148 and the desulfuration plant 149 and therefore upstream of the mixing apparatus 146, as seen in the direction of flow of the gasified fuel (B). The heat exchanger 150 is designed on the secondary side as an evaporator for water W as the flow medium. At the same time, the heat exchanger 150 is designed as a medium-pressure evaporator for the water W and therefore for generating steam at a pressure of about 5 to 7 bar, that is to say still sufficient for admixing the steam to the synthesis gas SG upstream of the combustion chamber 6.<br>
The heat exchanger 150 is connected on the steam side, via a steam line 152, to a further mixing apparatus 154 which is itself connected into the fuel line 130 downstream of the mixing apparatus 14 6, as seen in the direction of flow of the synthesis gas SG. The heat exchanger 150 is thus connected on the steam side to the combustion chamber 6 of the gas turbine 2 via the steam line 152 and via the further mixing apparatus 154 . The medium-pressure steam generated in the heat exchanger 150 can therefore be supplied to the synthesis gas SG flowing into the combustion chamber 6, the synthesis gas SG being laden with steam. This ensures a particularly low pollutant emission during the combustion of the synthesis gas SG. At the same time, a heat exchanger 155 is connected into the fuel line 130 between the mixing apparatus 146 and the further mixing apparatus 154.<br>
Moreover, the heat exchanger 150 is connected on the steam side to the low-pressure stage 120 of the water/steam circuit 24 via a branch line 156 which<br><br>
- 14- -<br>
branches off from the steam line 152. At the same time, in order to ensure a pressure<br><br>
level suitable for the low-pressure stage 120 in the outflow side part of the branch line 156, a regulating valve 165 is connected into said branch line.<br>
For the further cooling of the crude gas, a second heat exchanger 159 is connected on the primary side into the fuel line 130 downstream of the heat exchanger 150 in the direction of flow of the synthesis gas SG. The heat exchanger 159 is designed on the secondary side as an evaporator for water W as the flow medium. In this case, the heat exchanger 15 9 is designed as a low-pressure evaporator for the water W and therefore for generating steam at about 6-7 bar. The heat exchanger 159 is connected on the steam side to the branch line 156.<br>
For effective separation of sulfur compounds from the synthesis gas SG, a COS hydrolysis device 160 is connected into the fuel line 130 between the heat exchanger 159 and the desulfuration plant 149. A further heat exchanger 161 for further crude-gas cooling is located on the primary side upstream of this COS hydrolysis device in order to establish a particularly favorable temperature for COS hydrolysis. This heat exchanger 161 is loaded on the secondary side with medium-pressure feedwater from the water/steam circuit 24, as illustrated by the arrow P.<br>
In order to cool the crude gas, a further heat exchanger 151 is located downstream of the COS hydrolysis device 160. The heat exchanger 151 is loaded on the secondary side with medium-pressure feedwater from the water/steam circuit 24, as illustrated by the arrow P. For the further cooling of the crude gas, two further heat exchangers 153 and 167 are connected into the fuel line 130 upstream of the desulfuration plant 149, as seen in the direction of flow of the crude gas. In the heat exchanger 153, the crude gas is cooled on the primary side and the desulfurated crude gas is heated again on the secondary side. The crude gas is cooled in the heat exchanger 167 to a temperature at which desulfuration of the crude gas can take place in<br><br>
- 16 -<br>
a particularly advantageous way. At the same time, the heat exchanger 167 is loaded on the secondary side<br><br>
17-<br>
with cold condensate or cooling water in a way not illustrated in any more detail.<br>
For particularly low pollutant emission during the combustion of the gasified fuel in the combustion chamber 6, there may be provision for loading the gasified fuel with steam prior to entry into the combustion chamber 6. This may take place in a saturator system in a thermally particularly advantageous way. For this purpose, a saturator may be connected into the fuel line 130 between the mixing apparatus 146 and the heat exchanger 155, the gasified fuel being carried in said saturator in countercurrent to a heated water stream also designated as saturator water. In this case, the saturator water or the water stream circulates in a saturator circuit which is connected to the saturator and into which a circulating pump is normally connected. At the same time, in order to compensate the losses of saturator water which occur during the saturation of the gasified fuel, a feedline is connected to the saturator circuit.<br>
In order to cool the part stream T of compressed air, to be supplied to the air separation plant 138 and also designated as extraction air, a heat exchanger 162 is connected on the primary side into the extraction air line 140 and is designed on the secondary side as a medium-pressure evaporator for a flow medium S'. In order to form evaporator recirculation 163, the heat exchanger 162 is connected to a water/steam drum 164 designed as a medium-pressure drum. The water/steam drum 164 is connected via lines 166, 168 to the medium-pressure drum 96 assigned to the water/steam recirculation 100. Alternatively, however, the heat exchanger 162 may also be directly connected on the secondary side to the medium-pressure drum 96. In the exemplary embodiment, therefore, the water/steam drum 164 is connected indirectly to the heating surface 98 designed as a medium-pressure evaporator. Moreover, for the make-up feed of evaporated flow medium S', a feedwater line 170 is connected to the water/steam drum 164.<br><br>
Connected into  the  extraction  air  line  14 0 downstream of the heat exchanger 162, as seen in the direction of flow of the part stream T of compressed air, is a further heat exchanger 172 which is designed on the secondary side as a low-pressure evaporator for a  flow medium S" .  In  this  case,  in  order  to  form evaporator recirculation 174, the heat exchanger 172 is connected to a water/steam drum 176 designed as a low-pressure  drum.   In  the  exemplary  embodiment,   the water/steam drum 176 is connected via lines 178, 180 to the low-pressure drum 122 assigned to the water/steam recirculation 126 and is thus connected indirectly to the heating  surface  12 4  designed as  a  low-pressure evaporator.  Alternatively,  however,  the  water/steam drum 176 may also be connected in another suitable way, the steam extracted from the water/steam drum 176 being capable of being supplied as process steam and/or as heating steam to a secondary consumer.  In a further alternative embodiment, the heat exchanger 172 may also be connected directly on the secondary side to the low-pressure drum 122. Moreover, the water/steam drum 176 is connected to a feedwater line 182.<br>
The evaporator recirculations 163, 17 4 may in each case be designed as forced recirculation, the recirculation of the flow medium S' or S" being ensured by a circulating pump, and the flow medium S', S" evaporating at least partially in the heat exchanger 162 or 172 designed as an evaporator. In the exemplary embodiment, however, both the evaporator recirculation 163 and the evaporator recirculation 174 are designed in each case as natural recirculation, the recirculation of the flow medium S' or S" being ensured by the pressure differences established during the evaporation process and/or by the geodetic arrangement of the respective heat exchanger 162 or 172 and of the respective water/steam drum 164 or 176. In this embodiment, only one comparatively small-dimensioned circulating pump {not illustrated) for starting up the system is connected in<br><br>
- 19-<br>
each case into the evaporator recirculation 163 or into the evaporator recirculation 174.<br><br>
20<br>
A cooling-air line 192 branches off from the extraction air line 140 downstream of the heat exchanger 172, as seen in the direction of flow of the part stream T, a part quantity T' of the cooled part stream T being capable of being supplied to the gas turbine 2 via said cooling-air line as cooling air for blade cooling.<br>
Even when oil is used as fossil fuel B, the gas and steam turbine plant 1 has particularly high overall efficiency. Utilizing the heat which is carried in the crude gas and which may, in particular, take the form of latent heat at a comparatively low temperature level for evaporating the water W makes it possible to supply this heat into the plant process in a particularly effective and flexible way. In particular, supplying the steam thereby generated into synthesis gas SG flowing out of the mixing apparatus 146 makes it possible for the mixed gas to be laden sufficiently with steam, even without the connection of a saturator which per se, together with the further components assigned to it, would entail a significant outlay in terms of manufacture and assembly. This ensures that even low limit values for pollutant emission are adhered to at a particularly low outlay.<br><br>
