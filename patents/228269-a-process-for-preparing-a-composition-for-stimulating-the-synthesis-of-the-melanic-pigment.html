				<td>Technical sector<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing a composition for stimulating synthesis of melanic pigment. More particularly, to     a     composition developed   for   stimulating   the   synthesis   of   the   melanic   pigment   of the skin, and therefore useful in the treatment of the vitiligo, as well as to the procedure for obtaining this composition. Prior Art<br>
The vitiligo or leucoderm is an illness of the oldest known by the humanity, that is characterized by the loss of the cells that produce of the melanic pigment of the skin. This illness affects approximately 1% of the world's population, without distinguishing age, sex or race. It is of ethiology unknown and without a defined therapy until the moment, and it is characterized by a gradual depigmentation of the skin of patients subjected to situations of extreme nervous tension, which affects their psyche and social behavior unfavorably once their external symptoms begin, under the aspect of areas of white skin surrounded by a hyperpigmentated halo, showing fundamentally in the face, trunk or articular regions. It is known from the state of the art that certain chemical substances of vegetable origin or semisynthetically produced, denominated psoralens, can be used for the treatment of the vitiligo. These substances, when being administered by oral or topical route, concentrate on the melanocytes or dermal pigment-producing cells, absorbing the energy coming from the ultraviolet radiation and promoting the production of this pigment, the melanin (Arnold, M. J. Jr. "Psoralens and Suntan Hawaii Med. J. 1957-16391); (Becker, S.W. Jr. "Methods of increasing skin pigmentation J. Sec. Cosmetic Ehem. 1958-9-80); (Fitzpatrick, T.B. Pigmentary Diseases Current Therapy 1958-314); (Becker, S.W. Jr. "Effects of 8-Methoxy Psoralen and  ultraviolet  light  in  human  skin".   Science   1958-127-878);   (Sidi,   E.<br>
Planat, P. Practical considerations on current treatment of vitiligo Revue of Medicins, 1968-23 Dec).<br>
However, the psoralens are not exempt of secondary toxic effects, producing dermatitis and necrosis fo the skin when being applied by topical route. Also, their effect is slow and reversible in most of the cases when discontinuing the medication.<br>
On the other hand, these substances present difficulties for their application, which requires the gradual increment of the daily time of exposition of the patient to the ultraviolet radiation, causing in occasions severe toxic reactions such as burns due to their topical administration or hepatic failure, digestive, renal or nervous disorders with their administration by oral, route.<br>
The known nearer similar technical solution to the present invention is the Melagenin Lotion®, Patent. FR 8220746.<br>
The Melagenin Lotion® is an alcoholic extract to 50% of human placenta, which is obtained from healthy pregnat women under aseptic conditions after normal childbirths. This extract contains a lipoprotein of molecular weight among 1500 - 4000 Daltons, which constitutes its active principle. This substance stimulates the reproduction of the melanocytes and the synthesis of the melanic pigment, also accelerating the oxidation of the amino acid L-dopa in presence of solar light, which favors its transformation in melanin after internal chemical processes.<br>
The Melagenin Lotion® has been used successfully until the moment for the treatment of vitiligo. According to the clinical trials carried out, their use has reached a remarkable effectiveness in all the patients where it has been applied (Miyares Cao C, Taboas M. y Lopez H. "Informe preliminar sobre el empleo de extracto placentario humano en la terapeutica del Vitiligo". Revista Cubana de Farmacia 10 (1). 1976; Miyares Cao C. y colaboradores. Estudio experimental y clinico del efecto pigmentante epidermico del extracto placentario humano". Revista Cubana de Farmacia. Volumen 20, No. 6, Noviembre-Diciembre 1981; Sharma S. K.,. Jain R. K and Sharma A.  K. Topical human placental extract for the treatment of<br>
Vitiligo, A preliminary study; Miyares C. Y colaboradores: Estudio experimental y clinico del efecto pigmentante epidermico del extracto placentario humane Annais Brasileiros de Dermatologia. 1986: 61: 3 (suplemento); Miyares Cao C. Melagenina Producto Cubano. Nuevo y Eficaz medicamento para el tratamiento del Vitiligo. Serie de Resenas Nacionales. Ed. Palacio de las Convenciones. La Habana, Pag. 15. 1986). The Melagenin Lotion®, although it lacks collateral noxious effects, is a product that has to be used in three daily applications with interval among them of 8 hours, and accompanied by solar or infrared exposition in one of the applications. All this hinders the treatment compliance in most patients. Similarly it is known from the state of the art that calcium has an active participation in the process of pigmentation of the skin, by means of the stimulation of the secretory activity of the melanocytes, in connection with the concentration of this ion (Meyer, A. 1986. Influence of calcium on the melanocytes in the inner ear. Abst; 13th International Pigment Cell Conference Oct. 5-6, Tucson, Arizona, USES; and Negishi, S. 1986. The role of calcium in light response of onyzias melonophores. Abst; 13th International Pigment Cell Conference Oct. 5-6, Tucson, Arizona, USES). Disclosure of the invention<br>
The novelty of the present invention consists on a new composition containing the same active principle of the Melagenin Lotion®, in this case an alphalipoprotein obtained from the placental human cotyledons, by means of the treatment of these with organic solvents, and their later redisolution in a solution of ethanol with calcium chloride, which allows that a product is obtained that shows a synergic effect between both components on its pigmenting effect, decreasing the number of applications of this product from 1 every 8 hours for patient, to 1 every 24 hours, being also eliminated the necessity to expose the patient to solar or infrared radiations after any of the applications.<br>
STATEMENT OF INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a process for preparing a composition for stimulating synthesis of melanic pigment, said process comprising the steps of: a) crushing a kilogram of frozen human placental cotyledons and macerating with equal part weight/volume of ethanol at 90 to 96°C and obtaining a macerated slurry, b) filtering the macerated slurry, leaving it to rest for a period of about 24 hours and obtaining an extract containing pigmenting factor, c) preparing a mixture by adding saturated solution of benzoic acid with ethanol in the range of 90 to 96 % w/v with 200 ml extract of step (b), d) agitating the mixture for a time period in the range of 10 to 50 minutes and filtering the same to obtain a precipitate &amp; extract, e) washing the precipitate with a saturated solution of benzoic acid and distilled water, f) adding 30% w/v acetone to the precipitate of step (g) and centrifuging the same, at a 1500 rpm for a period in the range of 10 to 30 minutes and obtaining the precipitate and centrifugate, h) washing the centrifugate of step (f) with acetone, drying in vacuum at room temperature, i) re-dissolving the product of step (g), in alcohol at 90 to 96°C and adding calcium chloride in the range of 0.2 to 4.0mg/ml and obtaining a solution mixture, j) obtaining desired composition by filtering the solution mixture obtained in step (h) through a column of sephadex using sodium buffer phosphate having pH in the range of 4 to 8.<br>
The new product obtained, denominated from this point Melagnin Plus can be used in a single dialy application, which constitutes the current practice in the world therapy.<br>
This product stimulates the synthesis of the melanic pigment of the skin<br>
and the reproduction of the melanocytes as it is demonstrated by the<br>
pharmacological trials executed, lacking any severe<br>
secondary reactions as shown in the toxicological, teratological and clinical<br>
trials carried out using it.<br>
This product is of easy obtaining and application, and the re-pigmenting<br>
begins   quickly   (15   to   20   days)   after  beginning   the   treatment,   being<br>
irreversible after discontinuing the application of the product. The color<br>
acquired by the skin where it is applied is identical to that of the areas of the<br>
patient's normal skin, which in turn don't increase the intensity of their<br>
coloration later on.<br>
As   the   matter   from   where   the   active   principle   of   the   product   is<br>
extracted     is      of     human     origin,      there      are      no      immunologic<br>
reactions    to    fear,    with    no    contraindications    related    to    age,    sex<br>
or race for its use.<br>
Obtaining of the active principle of the composition Melagenin Plus.<br>
For the obtaining of the active principle of the present invention it was<br>
carried out the following procedure:<br>
A kilogram of placental cotyledons was used after they were let to freeze<br>
during 7 to 10 days, then they were crushed and macerated with ethanol<br>
from 90 to 96° to equal parts weight/volume. Then, this macerated is filtered<br>
through     dense     gauze,     leaving     it     to     rest     during     24     hours.<br>
It was determined the pigmenting activity to the supernatant which was<br>
positive   after   20   to    50   days   of   being   used   in   topical   form   on<br>
ears of mouse Balb/C 57 BL 6.<br>
To 200 ml of this extract with the pigmenting factor are added by means of<br>
a hypodermic needle 10 ml of a saturated solution of benzoic acid in ethanol<br>
from 90 to 96°, made dissolving from 2 to 8 g of benzoic acid in 5 to 12 ml<br>
of ethanol of 90 to 96°.<br>
The   mixture  was   agitated   from   10  to   50   minutes   and   it  was   filtered<br>
with Whatman filter paper No. 2 to 5. Then it was washed the precipitate<br>
obtained     with     200     to     500     ml     of     a     saturated     solution     of<br>
benzoic acid in distilled water, by dissolving from 2 to 10 g of benzoic acid in 300 to 1000 ml of distilled water.<br>
Afterwards the precipitate was removed from the filter paper and they were added from 100 to 500 ml of 30% acetone. Then it was centrifuged to 1500 rpm during 10 to 30 minutes, being discarded the supernatant.<br>
The precipitate was again washed for 2 to 10 times more with 100 at 500 ml of acetone, drying off to the vacuum and to room temperature. The product was re-dissolved in alcohol from 90 to 96° containing 0.2 to 4.0 mg/ml of calcium chloride.<br>
Five ml of the above product with biological activity was filtered through Sephadex G-30 or 100, using buffer sodium phosphate 5 x 101 to 5 x 106 moles, pH = 4 at 8, which was packed in a column from 1 to 3 cm width and from 18 to 40 cm of height. The flow was from 10 to 30 drops for minute and the collected fractions from 5 to 10 ml each one. Two proteic peacks were obtained, the first one of 100 to 300 //g/ml and the second one of 20 to 150 pig/ml. The pigmenting activity was positive for the second peack, appearing within the 10 to 20 days after being used topically the lyophilized mixture in the guinea pig.<br>
The lyophilized mixtures of both proteic peacks were run in electrophoresis with polyacrilamide gel and in agarose, staining the first one with a coloring for proteins (amido black) and the second to detect lipids (sudan). In the electrophoresis of proteins it was observed a colored small band followed by another without coloring, both of little migration; a very visible band was also noticed in the region of albumin. In the electrophoresis of lipids, a band was observed in the region wherein the alphalipoproteins migrate.<br>
Synergic pigmenting effect of the Melagenin and Calcium. The melanocitopoyetic activity of the resulting product was evaluated by topical application of the Melagenin Plus during a period of time of 5 serial days in a daily occasion on the epidermis of the ears of black mice of the strain B6 D2. For the trial 60<br>
black mice separated in 4 groups denominated A, B, C and D were used and<br>
integrated  by   5   mice   each   one,   to  which  were   applied   the   following<br>
treatments.<br>
Group	Daily topical treatment<br>
A	70% Alcohol, as vehicle of the Melagenin® (Control)<br>
B	70% Alcoholic solution with addition of calcium<br>
chloride, concentration 1 mg/ml.<br>
C	Melagenin Lotion®<br>
D	Melagenin Lotion® with addition of calcium chloride<br>
at a concentration of 1 mg/ml (Melagenin Plus) The alcohol at 70%, the alcoholic solution at 70% with calcium chloride 1 mg/ml, as well as the Melagenin Lotion® and the Melagenin Plus were applied by rubbing the product with the fingers of the operator on the ears of the animals.<br>
Concluded the time of treatment is allowed to lapse 48 hours and the animals are sacrificed in order to extract them the epidermis of the ears and to subject them to the histochemical technique of the L-dopa oxidase that allows, by means of the microscopic observation, the melanocyte count for mm2 in this histologic structure.<br>
To determines the number of melanocytes for mm2, 5 different areas were selected from the densely populated zone of each ear, and using a particular program elaborated for this end (but in this case the specific section for count of cells) the number of cells was determined by mm2 in each one of the 5 areas so that 150 melanocytes values are obtained by mm2 per each group (15 animals per group and 10 counts per animal each).<br>
The values obtained in the melanocyte count by mm2 were subjected to analysis of variance of simple classification and with posteriority to a test of Kruskal-Wallis and test Student Newman-Keuls (SNK), in order to determine significant differences existing among these groups. The results obtained by means of this experience can be observed in the Table I, and being graphically shown in the Figure 1.<br><br>
Table 1<br>
Test of Kruskal-Wallis<br>
Quantity of melanocytes / mm2<br>

a= Melagenin Plus<br>
b= Melagenin Lotion®<br>
c= Alcohol 70 % + Calcium 1 mg/ml<br>
d= Alcohol 70 %<br>
It was observed that for p 
The increment of the melanocyte number was bigger in the animals treated with Melagenin Plus.<br>
Other differences found were:<br>
•	There is  a significant difference among the results  obtained using Melagenin Plus and using Melagenin Lotion® only.<br>
•	There is a significant differences among the results obtained using Melagenin Plus and using alcohol plus calcium only.<br>
•	There is a significant difference among the results obtained using Melagenin Plus and using alcohol only.<br>
•	There is a significant difference among the results obtained using Melagenin Lotion® and using alcohol plus calcium.<br>
•	There is a significant difference  among the  results obtained using Melagenin Lotion® and the Control group treated with alcohol only.<br>
•	It doesn't exist significant difference between the Control group and the group treated with alcohol plus calcium.<br>
Additionally it was proven that when the Melagenin Lotion® and the<br>
Melagenin    Plus    are    applied    indistinctly    in    biological    trials,    it<br>
was observed that in the case of the Melagenin Plus the pigmenting<br>
effect in nipples of male guinea pigs is only visible in 13 days, while with<br>
the   Melagenin   Lotion®   this   happens   at   day   18.   Similarly,   in   the<br>
tale of the black mice, a   bigger melanin concentration it was observed<br>
using Melagenin Plus when the cuts are treated by the histochemical<br>
method, where it was observed to a bigger increment of the melanocytes in<br>
the basal region of the epidermis.<br>
Irritation studies in the skin of animals.<br>
The product Melagenin Plus was applied to a group of animals in an area<br>
of 42 cm2 with a dose of 20 mg/cm2 and in that same animal the solvent<br>
was applied.<br>
During the two weeks of the experiment it was not observed any type of<br>
irritation or affectation of the skin. The histopathologic studies do not<br>
reflect damage.<br>
In conclusion it can be pointed out that the product Melagenin Plus<br>
doesn't produce irritation in the skin.<br>
Clinical trials in humans.<br>
To carry out these trials, 30 vitiligo patients were selected randomly.<br>
The patients were separated alternatively in two groups denominated I<br>
and       II,        and       integrated       by        15       patients       each       one.<br>
Those belonging to the group I were indicated to use Melagenin Lotion®<br>
(Alcoholic Extract of Human Placenta at 50%)  applying it topically by<br>
means of finger rubbing on the areas of skin depigmentated by the illness,<br>
in three daily occasions with intervals of 8 hours (6.00 am, 2.00 pm and<br>
10.00 pm).<br>
In one of these occasions the treated areas should be exposed to lamps of<br>
infrared light of 250 watts of intensity, placed at a distance of 40 cm,<br>
during 15 minutes. The application of the medication should be repeated<br>
every 5 minutes in that interval of time.<br>
In turn the members of the group II would use Melagenin Plus (Alcoholic<br>
extract of human placenta at 50% containing calcium chloride) applying<br>
it in a similar way but in a single daily occasion, without the exposure to<br>
the      infrared      radiation      and     with      intervals      of     24      hours.<br>
The   participants   in   the   trial   should   remain   before   its   beginning<br>
without any specific treatment.<br>
The patients object of the experience were evaluated monthly during a<br>
period   of time   of  6   months,   fixed   to   compare   in  both   groups   the<br>
repigmentation   degree   obtained   with   each   product,   as   well   as   the<br>
development of secondary reactions.<br>
They  were   practiced  biopsies   of  areas   of  skin   depigmented   to   the<br>
beginning and final of the experience in 5 patients of each group selected<br>
randomly.<br>
Histological technique of L-dopa Oxidase  (Negishi,  S.   1986. The role<br>
calcium    in    light    response    of   onyzias    melanophores.    Abst;    13th<br>
International Pigment cell Conference oct 5-6 Tucson, Arizona, USES) was<br>
used to identify the melanocytes in the same ones.<br>
Jointly the differences were determined in the consumption of flasks of the<br>
medication in each group.<br>
For the procedure of the statistical analysis of the percentage of reduction<br>
of the depigmented corporal surface in each group, as well as for the<br>
determination of the same for patient, a program was used elaborated<br>
with such objective (Coyula, R. Automatizacion de la Creacion de Historia<br>
Clinica de los enfermos de Vitiligo.  Ira Conferencia Latinoamericana de<br>
Aplicaciones de la Matematica y la Computacion a la Biologia. CENIC, 31<br>
Oct. - 30 Nov. 1991, La Habana. Cuba).<br>
The results obtained by means of this clinical trial are summarized in<br>
Tables II, III, IV and V, in which they have been considered as the patients'<br>
data the number of their clinical history for their identification, the age,<br>
the sex,  the race and the years that the have suffered of the illness.<br>
Among  the  parameters  that  have  been  evaluated  they  are  the  %  of<br>
depigmentation at the beginning and at the end of the treatment, the % of<br>
pigmentation reached and the flasks of the medication consumed during this treatment concluding. Likewise, the analyzed areas corresponding to each one of this patients treated (face, neck, trunk, extremities or genitals) are shown in the table pertaining to each treatment type.<br>

Analyzing  the   previous   tables   it   can  be   observed   that   after  having<br>
concluded the 6 months of treatment, an average value of 59.11% of<br>
decrease of the body surface depigmented by the illness is appreciated in<br>
the group treated with Melagenin Lotion® and of 50.79% in that treated<br>
with Melagenin Plus, without being appreciated any significant difference<br>
between both results, for a value p 
They didn't observed local or systemic secondary reactions in the patients<br>
from the groups subjected to the trial.<br>
The  biopsies  practiced  in  the   5  patients  of each  group   showed   the<br>
reappearance of the melanocytes in the vitiligo areas selected for the<br>
histologic study pre and post treatment.<br>
Finally, a bigger consumption of medication flasks was observed in the<br>
group treated with Melagenin Lotion® with a total of 264 and an average<br>
of 17,6 flasks for patient in the 6 months that the experience lasted,<br>
regarding the group treated with Melagenin Plus, in the one which alone<br>
56 flasks were used, with an average of 3.7 flasks for patient in same time.<br>
The histological study carried out demonstrated that the re-pigmenting<br>
effect of both products on the areas affected by vitiligo is due to that they<br>
induce   again  the   reproduction   of the   melanocytes   in   these   places.<br>
The   absence   of  reactions   systematic   local   secondary   reaffirms   the<br>
innocuoity of both products.<br>
The synergic action of the Calcium and the Melagenin facilitates the<br>
execution of the treatment on the part of the vitiligo patients, decreasing<br>
the number of daily applications of the product and consequently the<br>
consumption of flasks in each treatment. Also the new formulation allows<br>
that the necessity of exposing the patient to solar or infrared radiations<br>
after the application is eliminated.<br>
Brief description of the drawings.<br>
Figure 1 shows the melanocytopoyetic action obtained through an assay of<br>
ear of black mice in 4 groups denominated A, B, C and D, to which were<br>
applied the following treatments:<br>
Group	Daily topical treatment<br>
A   "	70% Alcohol, as vehicle of the Melagenin® (Control)<br>
B	70% Alcoholic solution with addition of calcium<br>
chloride, concentration 1 mg/ml.<br>
C	Melagenin Lotion®<br>
D	Melagenin Lotion® with addition of calcium chloride<br>
at a concentration of 1 mg/ml (Melagenin Plus)<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1.	A  process for preparing a composition for stimulating synthesis of melanic<br>
pigment, said process comprising the steps of:<br>
a)	taking a macerated slurry of frozen human placental cotyledons in filtering the same &amp; leaving it to rest for a period of 24 hours, to obtain an extract containing pigmenting factor,<br>
b)	preparing a mixture by adding saturated solution of benzoic acid with ethanol in the range of 90 to 96 % w/v with 200 ml extract of step (a),<br>
c)	agitating the mixture for a time period in the range of 10 to 50 minutes and filtering the same to obtain a first precipitate and an extract,<br>
d)	washing the precipitate with a saturated solution of benzoic acid and distilled water to obtain a washed precipitate,<br>
e)	adding 30% w/v acetone to the washed precipitate of step (d) and centrifuging the same, at a 1500 rpm for a period in the range of 10 to 30 minutes and to obtain a second precipitate and a centrifugate,<br>
f)	washing the centrifugate of step (e) with acetone, drying the same under vacuum at room temperature,<br>
g)	re-dissolving the product of step (f), in alcohol at 90 to 96 C and adding calcium chloride in the range of 0.2 to 4.0mg/ml and obtaining a solution mixture, and<br>
h)    filtering the solution mixture obtained in step (g) through a column of<br>
sephadex using sodium phosphate buffer having pH in the range of 4<br>
to 8 to obtain the desired composition.<br>
2)      A process process for preparing a composition for stimulating synthesis of<br>
melanic pigment substantially as herein described with reference to the forgoing<br>
examples.<br></td>
