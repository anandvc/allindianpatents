				<td>Chroman derivatives<br>
The invention relates to chroman derivatives of the formula  I<br><br>
in which<br>
R1      is acyl having 1-6 C atoms, -CO-R5 or an amino<br>
protective group, R2      is H or alkyl having 1-6 C atoms, R3, R4  in each case independently of one another are<br>
H, alkyl having 1-6 C atoms, CN, Hal or COOR2, R5      is phenyl which is unsubstituted or mono- or<br>
disubstituted by alkyl having 1-6 C atoms, OR2<br>
or Hal, X      is H,H or O, Hal     is F, C1, Br or I, and their salts.<br>
The invention also relates to the optically active forms, the racemates, the enantiomers and also the hydrates and solvates, e.g. alcoholates, of these compounds.<br>
Similar compounds are disclosed in EP 0 707 007.<br>
The invention was based on the object of finding novel compounds which can be used, in particular, as intermediates in the synthesis of medicaments.<br>
It has been found that the compounds of the formula I and their salts are important intermediates for the preparation of medicaments, in particular of those which show, for example, actions on the central nervous system.<br><br>
-	2 –<br>
The invention relates to the chroman derivatives of the formula X and  their salts.<br>
Above and below, the radicals R1, R2, R3, R4, R5 and X have the meanings indicated in the formulae I and II, if not expressly stated otherwise.<br>
In the above formulae, alkyl has 1 to 6, preferably 1,<br>
2,  3 or 4, C atoms. Alkyl is preferably methyl or<br>
ethyl, furthermore propyl, isopropyl, in addition also<br>
butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl or tert-butyl. Acyl has 1 to<br>
6,  preferably 1,  2,  3 or 4,  C atoms. Acyl is in<br>
particular acetyl, propionyl or butyryl.<br>
R2 is preferably H, in addition also methyl, ethyl or<br>
propyl.<br>
R3 and R4 are preferably H.<br>
R5 is preferably,  for example,  phenyl,  o-, m- or<br>
p-tolyl,  o-,  m-  or  p-hydroxyphenyl,  o-,  m-  or<br>
p-methoxyphenyl, o-, m- or p-fluorophenyl. The radical<br>
Rl  is acyl, -CO-R5 or else an amino protective group<br>
which  is  known  per  se;  acetyl  is  particularly<br>
preferred.<br>
The expression "amino protective group" is generally known and relates to groups which are suitable for protecting (for blocking) an amino group from chemical reactions, but which are easily removable after the desired chemical reaction has been carried out at other positions in the molecule. Typical groups of this type are, in particular, unsubstituted acyl, aryl, aralkoxymethyl or aralkyl groups. Since the amino protective groups are removed after the desired reaction (or reaction sequence), their nature and size is otherwise uncritical; however, those having 1-20, in particular 1-8, C atoms are preferred. The expression "acyl group" is to be interpreted in the widest sense in connection with the present process and the present compounds. It includes acyl groups derived from aliphatic, araliphatic, aromatic or heterocyclic carboxylic  acids  or  sulfonic  acids and also, in<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
particular, alkoxycarbonyl, aryloxycarbonyl and<br>
especially aralkoxycarbonyl groups. Examples of acyl<br>
groups of this type are alkanoyl such as acetyl,<br>
propionyl, butyryl; aralkanoyl such as phenylacetyl;<br>
aroyl such as benzoyl or toluyl; aryloxyalkanoyl such<br>
as phenoxyacetyl; alkoxycarbonyl such as<br>
methoxycarbonyl,    ethoxycarbonyl,	2,2,2-trichloro-<br>
ethoxycarbony1, BOC (tert-butoxycarbonyl) , 2-iodoethoxycarbonyl; aralkyloxycarbonyl such as CBZ (carbobenzoxycarbonyl, also called "Z"), 4-methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl, FMOC (9-fluorenylmethoxy-carbonyl) ; arylsulfonyl such as Mtr (4-methoxy-2,3,6-trimethylphenylsulfonyl). Preferred amino protective groups are BOC and Mtr, in addition CBZ or FMOC.<br>
The compounds of the formula I can have one or more chiral centres and therefore occur in various stereoisomeric forms. The formula I includes all these forms.<br>
The invention furthermore relates to a process for the preparation of chroman derivatives of the formula I according to Claim 1 and also of their salts, in which X is 0, characterized in that a compound of the formula II<br><br>
in which R1, R2, R3, R4   have the meanings indicated in Claim 1 and X is O,<br>
is hydrogenated with the aid of an enantiomerically enriched catalyst.<br>
The invention also relates to a process for the preparation of chroman derivatives of the formula I<br><br>
-	4 –<br>
according to Claim 1 and also of their salts, in which X is H,H, characterized in that a compound of the formula II<br><br>
in which R1, R2, R3, R4 have the meanings indicated in<br>
Claim 1 and X is 0,<br>
is hydrogenated with the aid of an enantiomerically<br>
enriched catalyst,<br>
and then reduced in the customary manner.<br>
In particular, it has been found that (2-acetylaminomethyl)chromen-4-one can be hydrogenated using various enantiomerically pure rhodium-diphosphane complexes to give enantiomerically enriched (2-acetylaminomethyl)chroman-4-one.<br>
The  invention  also  relates  to  a  process  for  the preparation of chroman derivatives of the formula I, characterized in that  the enantiomerically  enriched catalyst is a transition metal complex.<br>
Particularly preferably, the catalyst is a transition metal complex comprising a metal selected from the group rhodium, iridium, ruthenium and palladium.<br>
The invention furthermore relates to a process for the preparation of chroman derivatives of the formula I, characterized in that the catalyst  is a  transition metal  complex  in  which  the  transition  metal  is complexed with a chiral diphosphane ligand.<br>
The ligands below may be mentioned by way of example:<br><br>
-   5   -<br><br><br><br>
- 6 -<br>
Depending on the choice of the (R) or (S) enantiomer of the ligand in the catalyst, the (R) or (S) enantiomer is obtained in an excess.<br>
Precursors used for the chiral ligands are compounds such as, for example, Rh(COD)2OTf (rhodium-cyclooctadiene triflate), [Rh(COD)Cl]2, Rh(COD)2BF4, [Ir(COD)Cl]2, Ir(COD)2BF4 or [Ru(COD)Cl2]x.<br>
The compounds of the formula I and also the starting substances for their preparation are otherwise prepared by methods known per se, such as are described in the literature (e.g. in the standard works such as Houben-Weyl, Methoden der organischen Chemie [Methods of Organic Chemistry], Georg-Thieme-Verlag, Stuttgart), mainly under reaction conditions which are known and suitable for the reactions mentioned. Use can also be made in this case of variants which are known per se, but not mentioned here in greater detail.<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
If desired, the starting substances can also be formed in situ such that they are not isolated from the reaction mixture, but immediately reacted further to give the compounds of the formula I.<br>
The compounds of the formula II are known in some cases; the unknown compounds can easily be prepared analogously to the known compounds.<br>
The conversion of a compound of the formula II in which X is O into a compound of the formula I in which X is O is carried out according to the invention using hydrogen gas with the aid of an enantiomerically enriched catalyst in an inert solvent such as, for example, methanol or ethanol.<br>
Suitable inert solvents are furthermore, for example,<br>
hydrocarbons such as hexane, petroleum ether, benzene,<br>
toluene or xylene;  chlorinated hydrocarbons such as<br>
trichloroethylene,      1,2-dichloroethane,      carbon<br>
tetrachloride, chloroform or dichloromethane; alcohols<br>
such as isopropanol,  n-propanol,  n-butanol or tert-<br>
butanol;  ethers such as diethyl  ether,  diisopropyl<br>
ether, tetrahydrofuran (THF), or dioxane; glycol ethers<br>
such as ethylene glycol monomethyl or monoethyl ether<br>
(methyl  glycol  or  ethyl  glycol),  ethylene  glycol<br>
dimethyl ether (diglyme); ketones such as acetone or<br>
butanone; amides such as acetamide, dimethylacetamide<br>
or   dimethylformamide   (DMF);   nitriles   such  as<br>
acetonitrile;  sulfoxides such as dimethyl  sulfoxide<br>
(DMSO);  carbon  disulfide;  nitro  compounds  such  as<br>
nitromethane or nitrobenzene;  esters such as ethyl<br>
acetate, and optionally also mixtures of the solvents<br>
mentioned with one another or mixtures with water.<br>
The reaction time of. the enantioseleetive hydrogenation, depending on the conditions used. is between  a  few  minutes  and  14 days;  the  reaction<br><br>
-	8 –<br>
temperature is between 0 and 150°, normally between 20 and 130°.<br>
Customarily, the catalyst/substrate ratio is between 1:2000 and 1:50, particularly preferably to 1:1000 and 1:100. The reaction time is then, for example, between 3 and 20 hours. The hydrogenation is carried out under 1-200 bar of hydrogen, preferably at 3-100 bar.<br>
The conversion of a compound of the formula II in which X is O into a compound of the formula I in which X is H,H is carried out according to the invention using hydrogen gas with the aid of an enantiomerically enriched catalyst in an inert solvent such as methanol or ethanol, such as described above, followed by a conversion of the 4-oxo group into a methylene group according to known conditions. The reduction is preferably carried out using hydrogen gas under transition metal catalysis (for example by hydrogenation on Raney nickel or Pd-carbon in an inert solvent such as methanol or ethanol) .<br>
The conversion of compounds of the formula I in which R3, R4 is COOalkyl into compounds of the formula I in which R3, R4 is COOH is carried out, for example, using NaOH or KOH in water, water-THF or water-dioxane at temperatures between 0 and 100°.<br>
The removal of a radical R1 from a compound of the formula I is carried out - depending on the protective group used - for example using strong acids, expediently using TFA (trifluoroacetic acid) or perchloric acid, but also using other strong inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid, strong organic carboxylic acids such as trichloroacetic acid or sulfonic acids such as benzene- or p-toluenesulfonic acid. The presence of an additional inert solvent is possible, but not always necessary. Suitable inert solvents are preferably organic solvents, for example carboxylic acids such as acetic<br><br>
-	9 –<br>
acid, ethers such as tetrahydrofuran or dioxane, amides such as dimethylformamide, halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane, in addition also alcohols such as methanol, ethanol or isopropanol and also water. In addition, mixtures of the abovementioned solvents are possible. TFA is preferably used in an excess without addition of a further solvent, perchloric acid in the form of a mixture of acetic acid and 70% perchloric acid in the ratio 9:1. The reaction temperatures are expediently between approximately 0 and approximately 50°; the reaction is preferably carried out between 15 and 30°.<br>
The BOC group is preferably removed using TFA in dichloromethane or using approximately 3 to 5 N hydrochloric acid in dioxane at 15-30°.<br>
The removal of the acetyl group is carried out according to customary methods (P.J. Kocienski, Protecting Groups, Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart, 1994).<br>
Hydrogenolytically removable protective groups (e.g. CBZ or benzyl) can be removed, for example, by treating with hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst (e.g. of a noble metal catalyst such as palladium, expediently on a support such as carbon). Suitable solvents in this case are those indicated above, in particular, for example, alcohols such as methanol or ethanol or amides such as DMF. As a rule, the hydrogenolysis is carried out at temperatures between approximately 0 and 100° and pressures between approximately 1 and 200 bar, preferably at 20-30° and 1-10 bar.<br>
A base of the formula I can be converted into the associated acid addition salt using an acid, for example by reaction of equivalent amounts of the base and of the acid in an inert solvent such as ethanol and subsequent evaporation. For this reaction, suitable acids are particularly those which yield physiologically acceptable salts. Thus inorganic acids<br><br>
-	10 –<br>
can  be  used,  e.g.  sulfuric  acid,  nitric  acid, hydrohalic  acids  such  as  hydrochloric  acid . or hydrobromic   acid,   phosphoric   acids   such   as orthophosphoric  acid,  sulfamic  acid,  in  addition organic  acids,  in particular  aliphatic,  alicyclic, araliphatic,   aromatic  or  heterocyclic  mono-  or polybasic carboxylic, sulfonic or sulfuric acids, e.g. formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, pivalic acid, diethylacetic  acid,  malonic  acid,  succinic  acid, pimelic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, lactic acid, tartaric acid, malic acid, citric acid, gluconic acid, ascorbic  acid,  nicotinic  acid,  isonicotinic  acid, methane- or ethanesulfonic acid, ethanedisulfonic acid, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonic  acid,  benzenesulfonic  acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, naphthalenemono- and disulfonic acids   and   laurylsulfuric   acid.    Salts   with physiologically unacceptable acids, e.g. picrates, can be used for the isolation and/or purification of the compounds of the formula I.<br>
On the other hand, compounds of the formula I can be converted  into  the  corresponding  metal  salts,  in particular alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salts, using bases  (e.g.  sodium - or potassium hydroxide or carbonate), or into the corresponding ammonium salts.<br>
The invention furthermore relates to the use of	the<br>
compounds of the formula I as intermediates for	the<br>
synthesis of medicaments. Appropriate medicaments	are<br>
described, for example, in EP 0 707 007.<br>
The invention accordingly relates in particular to the<br>
use of the compounds of the formula I according to<br>
Claim 1 in the synthesis of<br>
(R)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-<br>
chroman and its salts, characterized in that<br>

The invention furthermore relates to the use of the compounds of the formula I as intermediates for the synthesis of medicaments which show actions on the central nervous system-Above and below, all temperatures are indicated in °C. In  the  following examples,  "customary working  up" means: if necessary, water is added,  the mixture is adjusted, if necessary, depending on the constitution of the final product, to a pH of between 2 and 10 and extracted with ethyl acetate or dichloromethane, the organic phase  is separated off,  dried over sodium sulfate and evaporated, and the residue is purified by chromatography on silica gel and/or by crystallization.

Examples<br>
Experimental data (complex preparation, hydrogenation, analytical methods):<br><br>
All reactions were carried out under inert conditions (i.e. anhydrous and  oxygen-free reaction conditions).<br>
1. Preparation of the catalyst/substrate solution:<br><br>
- 13 -<br>
1.1  Example:<br>
11.2  mg.   of    Rh(COD)2OTf    (rhodium-cyclooctadiene<br>
triflate) were dissolved in 5 ml of methanol and cooled<br>
to 0°C. A cooled solution of 1.1 eq of bisphosphane<br>
(e.g. 12.6 mg of (R,R)-Skewphos) in 5 ml of methanol<br>
was then added. After stirring at room temperature for,<br>
10 min,  the complex solution was treated with the<br>
substrate  solution  consisting  of  110 mg  of  (2-<br>
acetylaminomethyl)chromen-4-one in 10 ml of methanol.<br>
1.2. Example:<br>
51.4 mg of [Hh(COD)Cl]2 were dissolved in 4 ml of the solvent mixture toluene/methanol 5:1 and treated with a solution consisting of 5 ml of toluene, 1 ml of methanol and 1.1 eq of bisphosphane (e.g. 130.6 mg of (R)-BINAP). 1 ml of this catalyst complex solution was added to 510.8 mg of (2-acetylaminomethyl)chromen-4-one, dissolved in 15 ml of toluene and 3 ml of methanol.<br>
2.	Enantioselective hydrogenation<br>
The catalyst/substrate solution to be hydrogenated was filled into an autoclave in a countercurrent of protective gas. The protective gas atmosphere was replaced by flushing several times with hydrogen . (1-5 bar H2 atmosphere) . The batches analogous to 1.1. reacted even at room temperature and 5 bar of hydrogen. The catalysts analogous to 1.2- afforded the best results at 50°C and 80 bar of hydrogen. As a rule, the hydrogenation was terminated after 15 hours.<br>
3.	Sampling and analytical methods<br>
A sample was taken in a countercurrent of protective gas. The complex was separated off by column chromatography on silica gel (eluent: ethyl acetate) before the determination of the enantiomeric excesses.<br><br>
-	14 –<br>
The enantiomeric excess of the hydrogenation product was determined on the chiral HPLC phase;<br>
Column:       Daicel Chiralcel OJ (I.D. x length/mm;<br>
4.6 x 250)<br>
Eluent:       n-hexane: i-propanol =9:1<br>
Flow:	0.8 ml/min (18 bar, 28°C)<br>
Detection:    UV 250 nm Retention:    Rc (R) =  27 min; Rc(S) = 29 min<br>
The concentration of the crude hydrogenation solution led to the precipitation of the product. An increase in the enantiomeric excess was detected by means of fractional crystallization.<br>
4.	Further reduction<br>
After complete conversion was detected, the reduction of the keto group was carried out by means of palladium-carbon as a one-pot process. The crude ketone solution resulting from the homogeneous hydrogenation was treated with 10% by weight water-moist palladium-carbon (e.g. 100 mg of water-moist Pd/C to 1 g of (2-acetylaminomethyl)chromen-4-one) and 1 ml of glacial acetic acid. Hydrogenation was carried out at a hydrogen pressure of 7 bar and 50°C for 14 h.<br>
5.	Work-up and analytical methods<br>
The palladium-carbon was removed by filtration.<br>
The enantiomeric excess of the hydrogenation product<br>
was determined on a chiral HPLC phase:<br>
Column:       Daicel Chiralcel OJ (I.D. x length/mm:<br>
4.6 x 250)<br>
Eluent:       n-hexane: i-propanol = 9:1<br>
Flow:	0.8 ml/min -(18 bar, 28°C)<br>
Detection:     UV 250 nm Retention:     Rt(R) = 25 min; Rc(S) = 27 min<br><br>
- 15 -<br>
During the reduction with palladium-carbon, the enantiomeric excess remained unchanged.<br>
The concentration of the crude hydrogenation solution led to the precipitation of the product. An increase in the enantiomeric excess was detected by means of fractional crystallization.<br><br>
