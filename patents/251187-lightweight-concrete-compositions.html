One cement-based layer contains water, cement, and expanded polystyrene foam beads in first proportions and a second exterior surface contains water, cement, and expanded polystyrene foam beads in second proportions different than the first proportions.<br>
Generally, the prior art recognizes the utility of using expanded polymers, in some form, in concrete compositions, to reduce the overall weight of the compositions. The expanded polymers are primarily added to take up space and create voids in the concrete and the amount of "air space" in the expanded polymer is typically maximized to achieve this objective. Generally, the prior art assumes that expanded polymer particles will lower the strength and/or structural integrity of lightweight concrete compositions. Further, concrete articles made from prior art lightweight concrete compositions have at best inconsistent physical properties, such as Young's nodulus, thermal conductivity, and compressive strength, and typically demonstrate less than desirable physical properties.<br>
Therefore, there is a need in the art for lightweight concrete impositions that provide lightweight concrete articles having predictable and jesirable physical properties that overcome the above-described problems.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Other than in the operating examples or where otherwise indicated, all numbers or expressions referring to quantities of ingredients, reaction conditions, etc. used in the specification and claims are to be understood as modified in all instances by the term "about." Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical parameters set forth in the following specification and attached claims are approximations that can vary depending upon the desired properties, which the present invention desires to obtain. At the very<br><br>
least and not as an attempt to limit the application of tine doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims, each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of reported significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding techniques.<br>
Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth the broad scope of the invention are approximations, the numerical values set forth in the specific examples are reported as precisely as possible. Any numerical values, however, inherently contain certain errors necessarily resulting from the standard deviation found in their respective testing measurements.<br>
Also, it should be understood that any numerical range recited herein is intended to include all sub-ranges subsumed therein. For example, a range of "1 to 10" is intended to include all sub-ranges between and including the recited minimum value of 1 and the recited maximum value of 10; that is, having a minimum value equal to or greater than 1 and a maximum value of equal to or less than 10. Because the disclosed numerical ranges are continuous, they include every value between the minimum and maximum values. Unless expressly indicated otherwise, the various numerical ranges specified in this application are approximations.<br>
As used herein, the term "particles containing void spaces" refer to expanded polymer particles, prepuff particles, and other particles that include cellular and/or honeycomb-type chambers at least some of which are completely enclosed, that contain air or a specific gas or combination of gasses, as a non-limiting example prepuff particles as described herein.<br>
As used herein the terms "cement" and "cementltious" refer to materials that bond a concrete or other monolithic product, not the final product itself. In particular, hydraulic cement refers to a material that sets and hardens by undergoing a hydration reaction in the presence of a sufficient " quantity of water to produce a final hardened product.<br>
As used herein, the term "cementitious mixture" refers to a composition that includes a cement material, and one or more fillers, adjuvants, or other materials known in the art that form a slurry that hardens upon curing. Cement materials include, but are not limited to, hydraulic cement, gypsum, gypsum compositions, lime and the like and may or may not include water.<br><br>
Adjuvants and fillers include, but are not limited to sand, clay, fly ash, aggregate, air entrapment agents, colorants, water reducers/superplasticizers, and the like.<br>
As used herein, the term "concrete" refers to a hard strong building material made by mixing a cementitious mixture with sufficient water to cause the cementitious mixture to set and bind the entire mass.<br>
As used herein, all volume and weight percentages anticipate the use of a certain volume or weight of water. The particular amounts when referring to a dry-mix or ready-mix composition would be in the same proportions anticipating that the commensurate amount of water will be added to the dry-mix or ready-mix when it is to be finally formulated, mixed and otherwise readied for use.<br>
Ail compositional ranges expressed herein are limited in total to and do not exceed 100 percent (volume percent or weight percent) in practice. Where multiple components can be present in a composition, the sum of the maximum amounts of each component can exceed 100 percent, With the understanding that, and as those skilled in the art readily understand, that the amounts of the components actually used will conform to the maximum of 100 percent<br>
As used herein, the terms "(meth)acrylic" and "(meth)acrylate" are meant to include both acrylic and methacryiic acid derivatives, such as the corresponding alkyl esters often referred to as acrylates and (meth)acrylates, which the term *(meth)acrylate" is meant to encompass.<br>
As used herein, the term "polymer" is meant to encompass, without limitation, homopolymers, copolymers, graft copolymers, and blends and combinations thereof.<br>
In its broadest context, the present invention provides a method of controlling air entrapment in a formed article. The formed article can be made from any formable material, where particles containing void spaces are used to entrain air in a structurally supportive manner. Any suitable formable material can be used, so long as the particles containing void spaces are not damaged during the forming process.<br>
As used herein, the term "composite material" refers to a solid material which Includes two or more substances having different physical<br><br>
characteristics and in which each substance retains its identity while contributing desirable properties to the whole. As a non-limiting example, composite materials can include concrete within which prepuff beads are uniformly dispersed and embedded.<br>
Thus, the present invention is directed to methods of controlling air entrainment where an article is formed by combining a formable material and particles containing void spaces to provide a mixture and placing the mixture in a form.<br>
Although the application discloses in detail cementitious mixtures with polymer particles, the concepts and embodiments described herein can be applied by those skilled in the art to the other applications described above.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention are directed to a lightweight concrete (LWC) composition that includes a cementitious mixture and polymer particles. Surprisingly, it has been found that the size, composition, structure, and physical properties of the expanded polymer particles, and in some instances their resin bead precursors, can greatly affect the physical properties of LWC articles made from the LWC compositions of the invention. Of particular note is the relationship between bead size and expanded polymer particle density on the physical properties of the resulting LWC articles.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the cementitious mixture can be an aqueous cementitious mixture.<br>
The polymer particles, which can optionally be expanded polymer particles, are present in the LWC composition at a level of at least 10, in some instances at least 15, in other instances at least 20, in particular situations up to 25, in some cases at least 30, and in other cases at least 35 volume percent and up to 90, in some cases up to 85, in other cases up to 78, in some instances up to 75, in other instance up to 65, in particular instances up to 60, in some cases up to 50, and in other cases up to 40 volume percent based on the total volume of the LWC composition. The amount of polymer will vary depending on the particular physical properties desired in a finished LWC article. The amount of polymer particles in the LWC composition can be any value or can range between any of the values recited above.<br><br>
The polymer particles can include any particles derived from any suitable expandable thermoplastic material. The actual polymer particles are selected based on the particular physical properties desired in a finished LWC article. As a non-limiting example, the polymer particles, which can optionally be expanded polymer particles, can include one or more polymers selected from homopolymers of vinyl aromatic monomers; copolymers of at least one vinyl aromatic monomer with one or more of divinylbenzene, conjugated dienes, alkyl methacrylates, alkyl acrylates, acrylontoile, and/or maleic anhydride; polyolefins; polycarbonates; polyesters; polyamides; natural rubbers; synthetic rubbers; and combinations thereof.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the polymer particles include thermoplastic homopolymers or copolymers selected from homopolymers derived from vinyl aromatic monomers including styrene, isopropylstyrene, alpha-methylstyrene, nuclear methylstyrenes, chlorostyrene, tert-butylstyrene, and the like, as well as copolymers prepared by the copolymerization of at least one vinyl aromatic monomer as described above with one or more other monomers, non-limiting examples being divinylbenzene, conjugated dienes (non-limiting examples being butadiene, isoprene, 1, 3- and 2,4- hexadiene), alkyl methacrylates, alkyl acrylates, acrylonitrile, and maleic anhydride, wherein the vinyl aromatic monomer is present in at least 50% by weight of the copolymer. In an embodiment of the invention, styrenic polymers are used, particularly polystyrene. However, other suitable polymers can be used, such as polyolefins (e.g. polyethylene, polypropylene), polycarbonates, poiyphenyiene oxides, and mixtures thereof.<br>
In a particular embodiment of the invention, the polymer particles are expandable polystyrene (EPS) particles. These particles can be in the form of beads, granules, or other particles convenient for expansion and molding operations.<br>
In the present invention, particles polymerized in a suspension process, which are essentially spherical resin beads, are useful as polymer particles or for making expanded polymer particles. However, polymers derived from solution and bulk polymerization techniques that are extruded and cut into particle sized resin bead sections can also be used.<br><br>
In an embodiment of the invention, resin beads (unexpanded) containing any of the polymers or polymer compositions described herein have a particle size of at least 0.2, in some situations at least 0.33, in some cases at least 0.35, in other cases at least 0.4, in some instances at least 0.45 and in other instances at least 0.5 mm. Also, the resin beads can have a particle size of up to 3, in some instances up to 2, in other instances up to 2.5, in some cases up to 2.25, in other cases up to 2, in some situations up to 1.5 and in other situations up to 1 mm. In this embodiment, the physical properties of LWC articles made according to the invention have inconsistent or undesirable physical properties when resin beads having particle sizes outside of the above described ranges are used to make the expanded . polymer particles. The resin beads used in this embodiment can be any value or can range between any of the values recited above.<br>
The expandable thermoplastic particles or resin beads can optionally be impregnated using any conventional method with a suitable blowing agent. As a non-limiting example, the impregnation can be achieved by adding the blowing agent to the aqueous suspension during the polymerization of the polymer, or alternatively by re-suspending the polymer particles in an aqueous medium and then incorporating the blowing agent as taught in U.S. Pat No. 2,983,692. Any gaseous material or material which will produce gases on heating can be used as the blowing agent. Conventional blowing agents include aliphatic hydrocarbons containing 4 to 6 carbon atoms in the molecule, such as butanes, pentanes, hexanes, and the haldgenated hydrocarbons, e.g. CFC's and HCFC'S, which boil at a temperature below the softening point of the polymer chosen. Mixtures of these aliphatic hydrocarbon blowing agents can also be used.<br>
Alternatively, water can be blended with these aliphatic hydrocarbons blowing agents or water can be used as the sole blowing agent as taught in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,127,439; 6,160,027; and 6,242,540 in these patents, water-retaining agents are used. The weight percentage of water for use as the blowing agent can range from 1 to 20%. The texts of U.S. Patent Nos. 6,127,439,6,160,027 and 6,242,540 are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The impregnated polymer particles or resin beads are optionally expanded to a bulk density of at least 1.75 lb/ft3 (0.028 g/cc), in some<br><br>
circumstances at least 2 lb/ft3 (0.032 g/cc) in other circumstances at least 3 lb/ft3 (0.048 g/cc) and in particular circumstances at least 3.25 lb/ft3 (0.052 g/cc) or 3.5 lb/ft3 (0.056 g/cc). When non-expanded resin beads are used higher bulk density beads can be used. As such, the bulk density can be as high as 40 lb/ft3 (0.64 g/cc). In other situations, the polymer particles are at least partially expanded and the bulk density can be up to 35 lb/ft3 (0.56 g/cc), in some cases up to 30 lb/ft3 (0.48 g/cc), in other cases up to 25 lb/ft3 (0.4 g/cc), in some instances up to 20 lb/ft3 (0.32 g/cc), in other instances up to 15 lb/ft3 (0.24 g/cc) and in certain circumstances up to 10 lb/ft3 (0.16 g/cc). The bulk density of the polymer particles can be any value or range between any of the values recited above; The bulk density of the polymer particles, resin beads and/or prepuff particles is determined by weighing a known volume of polymer particles, beads and/or prepuff particles (aged 24 hours at ambient conditions).<br>
The expansion step is conventionally carried out by heating the impregnated beads via any conventional heating medium, such as steam, hot air, hot water, or radiant heat One generally accepted method for accomplishing the pre-expansion of impregnated thermoplastic particles is taught in U.S. Patent No. 3,023,175.<br>
The impregnated polymer particles can be foamed cellular polymer particles as taught in U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 10/021,716, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference. The foamed cellular particles can be polystyrene that are expanded and contain a volatile blowing agent at a level of less than 14 wt %, in some situations less than 6 wt %, in some cases ranging from about 2 wt % to about 5 wt %, and in other cases ranging from about 2.5 wt % to about 3.5 wt % based on the weight of the polymer.<br>
An interpolymer of a polyolefin and in situ polymerized vinyl aromatic monomers that can be included in the expanded thermoplastic resin or polymer particles according to the invention is disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,303,756 and 4,303,757 and U.S. Application Publication 2004/0152795, the relevant portions of which are herein incorporated by reference.<br>
The polymer particles can include customary ingredients and additives, such as flame retardants, pigments, dyes, colorants, plasticizers, mold<br><br>
release agents, stabilizers, ultraviolet light absorbers, mold prevention agents, antioxidants, rodenticides, insect repellants, and so on. Typical pigments include, without limitation, inorganic pigments such as carbon black, graphite, expandable graphite, zinc oxide, titanium dioxide, and iron oxide, as well as organic pigments such as quinacridone reds and violets and copper phthalocyanine blues and greens.<br>
In a particular embodiment of the invention the pigment is carbon black, a non-limiting example of such a material being EPS SILVER**, available from NOVA Chemicals Inc.<br>
In another particular embodiment of the invention the pigment is graphite, a non-limiting example of such a materia! being NEOPOR®, available from BASF Aktiengesellschaft Corp., Ludwigshafen am Rhein, Germany.<br>
When materials such as carbon black and/or graphite are included in the polymer particles, improved insulating properties, as exemplified by higher R values for materials containing carbon black or graphite (as determined jsing ASTM - C518), are provided. As such, the R value of the expanded polymer particles containing carbon black and/or graphite or materials made From such polymer particles are at least 5% higher than observed for particles or resulting articles that do not contain carbon black and/or graphite.<br>
The expanded polymer particles can have an average particle size of at least 0.2, in some circumstances at least 0.3, in other circumstances at least 0.5, in some cases at least 0.75, in other cases at least .0.9 and in some instances at least 1 mm and can be up to 8, in some circumstances up to 6, in other circumstances up to 5, in some cases up to 4, in other cases up to 3, and in some instances up to 2.5 mm. When the size of the expanded polymer particles is too small or too large, the physical properties of LWC articles made using the present LWC composition can be undesirable. The average particle size of the expanded polymer particles can be any value and can range between any of the values recited above. The average particle size of the expanded polymer particles can be determined using laser diffraction techniques or by screening according to mesh size using mechanical separation methods well known in the art<br><br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the polymer particles or expanded polymer particles have a minimum average cell wall thickness, which helps to provide desirable physical properties to LWC articles made using the present       x LWC composition. The average cell wall thickness and inner cellular dimensions can be determined using scanning electron microscopy techniques known in the art. The expanded polymer particles can have an average cell wall thickness of at least 0.15 jam, in some cases at ieast 0.2 \m\ and in other cases at ieast 0.25 \im. Not wishing to be bound to any particular theory, it is believed that a desirable average cell wall thickness results when resin beads having the above-described dimensions are expanded to the above-described densities.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the polymer beads are optionally expanded to form the expanded polymer particles such that a desirable cell wall thickness as described above is achieved. Though many variables can impact the wall thickness, it is desirable, in this embodiment, to limit the expansion of the polymer bead so as to achieve a desired wail thickness and resulting expanded polymer particle strength. Optimizing processing steps and blowing agents can expand the polymer beads to a minimum of 1.75 lb/ft3 (0.028 g/cc). This property of the expanded polymer bulk density, can be described by pcf (lb/ft3) or by an expansion factor (cc/g).<br>
As used herein, the term "expansion factor1! refers to the volume a given weight of expanded polymer bead occupies, typically expressed as cc/g.<br>
In order to provide expanded polymer particles with desirable cell wall thickness and strength, the expanded polymer particles are not expanded to their maximum expansion factor, as such an extreme expansion yields particles with undesirably thin cell walls and insufficient strength. Further, the polymer beads can be expanded at ieast 5%, in some cases at least 10%, and in other cases at least 15% of their maximum expansion factor. However, so as not to cause the cell wall thickness to be too thin, the polymer beads are expanded up to 80%, in some cases up to 75%, in other cases up to 70%, in some instances up to 65%, in other instances up to 60%, in some circumstances up to 55%, and in other circumstances up to 50% of their<br><br>
maximum expansion factor. The polymer beads can be expanded to any degree indicated above or the expansion can range between any of the values recited above. Typically, the polymer beads or prepuff beads do not further expand when formulated into the present cementltious compositions and do not further expand while the cementltious compositions set, cure and/or harden.<br>
As used herein, the term "prepuff refers to an expandable particle, resin and/or bead that has been expanded, but has not been expanded to its maximum expansion factor.<br>
The prepuff or expanded polymer particles typically have a cellular structure or honeycomb interior portion and a generally smooth continuous polymeric surface as an outer surface, i.e., a substantially continuous outer layer. The smooth continuous surface can be observed using scanning electron microscope (SEM) techniques at 1000X magnification. SEM observations do not indicate the presence of holes in the outer surface of the prepuff or expanded polymer particles. Cutting sections of the prepuff or expanded polymer particles and taking SEM observations reveals the generally honeycomb structure of the interior of the prepuff or expanded polymer particles.<br>
The polymer particles or expanded polymer particles can have any cross-sectional shape that allows for providing desirable physical properties in LWC articles. In an embodiment of the invention, the expanded polymer particles have a circular, oval or elliptical cross-section shape, in embodiments of the invention, the prepuff or expanded polymer particles have an aspect ratio of 1, in some cases at least 1 and the aspect ratio can be up to 3, in some cases up to 2 and in other cases up to 1.5.

In an embodiment of the invention, all or a portion of the sand or other fine aggregate used in the present cementitious mixture and/or lightweight concrete composition has a fineness modulus of less than 2, in some cases less than 1.9 and in other cases less than 1.8. As used herein, "fineness modulus" or "FM" refers to an empirical factor that gives a relative measure of the proportions of fine and coarse particles in an aggregate. FM is a value used to indicate the relative fineness or coarseness of a fine aggregate and can be determined according to ASTM C 117.  Although ASTM C 117 can be<br><br>
consulted for precise details, and is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, it can be summarized as follows. The FM is obtained by sieving a 500-gram sample of sand through a series of standard sieves (Nos. 4,8,16, 30,50, and 100). The weight retained on each sieve is converted into a cumulative percentage retained, starting with the No. 4 sieve. The sum of the six percentages is divided by 100. The resulting answer is the fineness modulus.<br>

Further, sand and/or other fine aggregate can provide up to 50, in some cases up to 45, in other cases up to 40, and in some instances up to 35 volume percent of the LWC composition. The amount of sand and/or other fine aggregate is adjusted to provide desired properties to the LWC composition.

The amount of sand and/or other fine aggregate having an FM value of less than 2 can be any value or range between any of the values recited above.<br>

The cementitious mixture, expanded polymer particles, and any other aggregates, additives and/or adjuvants are mixed using methods well known in the art. In an embodiment of the invention a liquid, in some instances water, is also mixed into the other ingredients.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, a dry mixture (i.e., containing minimal or no added water) can be produced, packaged and stored for future use. Such a dry mixture or "ready mix" can later be mixed with water to provide the lightweight concrete compositions described herein.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the concrete composition is a dispersion where the cementitious mixture provides, at least in part, a<br><br>
continuous phase and the polymer particles and/or expanded polymer particles exist as a dispersed phase of discrete particles in the continuous phase.<br>
As a particular and non-limiting embodiment of the invention, the concrete composition is substantially free of wetting agents or dispersing agents used to stabilize the dispersion.<br>
As a non-limiting embodiment of the invention and as not wishing to be limited to any single theory, some factors that can affect the performance of the present LWC composition include the volume fraction of the expanded resin bead, the average expanded bead size and the microstructure created by the inter-bead spacing within the concrete. In this embodiment, the inter-bead spacing can be estimated using a two-dimensional model. For simplicity in description, the inter-bead spacing can be limited to the bead radius. Additionally, and without meaning to limit the invention in anyway, it is assumed in this embodiment that the beads are arranged in a cubic lattice, bead size distribution in the LWC composition is not considered, and the distribution of expanded bead area in the cross-section is not considered. In order to calculate the number of beads per sample, a three-dimensional test cylinder is assumed.<br>
The smaller the expanded bead size, the greater the number of expanded beads required to maintain the same expanded bead volume fraction as described by equation 1 below. As the number of expanded beads increases exponentially, the spacing between the expanded beads decreases.<br>
AfesK/tf	(1)<br>
Nb represents the number of expanded beads.<br>
A LWC test specimen with diameter D and height H (usually 2" X 4" or 6" X 12"), containing dispersed expanded polymer beads of average expanded bead diameter S, and a given volume fraction Vd contains an amount of expanded polymer beads Afe given by equation 1:<br>
Note that Afeis inversely proportional to the cube of the expanded polymer bead diameter. The constant of proportionality, K= 1.5 VtfHD2, is a number that is dependent only on the sample size and the volume fraction of expanded polymer beads. Thus for a given sample size, and known<br><br>
expanded polymer bead volume fraction, the number of beads increases to a third power as the bead diameter decreases.<br>
As a non-limiting example, for a 2" X 4" LWC specimen, at 90 pcf (lb/ft3) (corresponding to expanded polymer bead 43% volume fraction with pre-puff bulk density of 1.25 pcf), the number of beads increases fourfold and sevenfold moving from a 0.65 mm bead to 0.4 mm and 0.33 mm beads respectively. At 2.08 pcf, the increase in the number of beads is sixfold and sevenfold for 0.4 mm and 0.33 mm beads respectively. At 5 pcf, the increases are twofold and threefold respectively. Thus, the density correlates to the bead size. As shown below, the density also affects the cell wall thickness. The strength of a concrete matrix populated by expanded beads is typically affected by the cell wall stiffness and thickness.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, where monodisperse spherical cells are assumed, it can be shown that the mean cell diameter d is related to the mean wall thickness 5 by equation 2:<br><br>
where p is the density of the foam and ps is the density of the solid polymer<br>
bead.<br>
Thus for a given polymer, depending on the particular expansion process used, one can obtain the same cell wall thickness (at a given cell<br>
size) or the same cell size at various values of s. The density is controlled not only by the cell size but also by varying the thickness of the cell wall.<br>
The table below exemplifies the variation of expanded polymer bead density with bead size for three classes of beads.<br><br><br>
Desirable microstructures and/or morphologies can fall into distinct classes. The first is a bicontinous or co-continuous composite with special. interfaces and the second includes special inclusions in a connected matrix. The effective properties of both bicontinous and singly connected microstructures are described by known optimal cross-property bounds.<br>
In many cases, the smaller the beads, the greater the number of beads required to maintain the same expanded polymer bead volume fraction as described by equation 1. As the number of beads increases exponentially, the spacing between the beads decreases.<br>
The optimal bounds can be described by a number of relations representing critical numbers or limits. As a non-limiting example, for a given volume fraction, there is often a critical bead size corresponding to a critical number of beads that can be dispersed to provide a desired morphology such that all the beads are isolated and the concrete is singly connected. It is also possible to form a morphology where all of the beads are non-isolated but contacting.<br>
Finite element analysis of a 2-dimensional cross section was performed using ANSYS® (a finite element analysis program available from ANSYS Inc., Canonsburg, PA). In the finite element mesh of the cross-<br><br>
section, the beads are modeled as non-contacting or isolated circles in a singly connected concrete matrix.<br>
The results demonstrate that under loading, the stresses build up in a direction perpendicular to the load axis. The maximum stress concentrations are at the horizontal boundary between the expanded polymer beads, which tend to be deformed from a circular shape to an elliptical shape.<br>
In a particular embodiment of the invention, the concrete composition contains at least some of the expanded polymer particles or prepuff particles arranged in a cubic or hexagonal lattice.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the present LWC composition is substantially free of air entraining agents, which are typically added to create air cells or voids in a batch of concrete.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the LWC composition can include reinforcement fibers. Such fibers act as reinforcing components, having a large aspect ratio, that is, their length/diameter ratio is high, so that a load is transferred across potential points of fracture. Non-limiting examples of suitable fibers include fiberglass strands of approximately one to one and three fourths inches in length, although any material can be used that has a higher Young's modulus than the matrix of the cementitious mixture, polypropylene fiber and other fibers as described above.<br>
The LWC compositions according to the invention can be set and/or hardened to form final concrete articles using methods well known in the art.<br>
The density of the set and/or hardened final concrete articles containing the LWC composition of the invention can be at least 40 lb/ft3 (0.64 g/cc), in some cases at least 45 lb/ft3 (0.72 g/cc) and in other cases at least 50 lb/ft3 (0.8 g/cc) lb/ft3 and the density can be up to 130 lb/ft3 (2.1 g/cc), in some cases 120 lb/ft3 (1.9 g/cc), in other cases up to 115 lb/ft3 (1.8 g/cc), in some circumstances up to 110 lb/ft3 (1.75 g/cc), in other circumstances up to 105 lb/ft3 (1.7 g/cc), in some instances up to 100 lb/ft3 (1.6 g/cc), and in other instances up to 95 lb/ft3 (1.5 g/cc). The density of the present concrete articles can be any value and can range between any of the values recited above. The density of the LWC composition is determined according to ASTMC138.<br><br>
In a particular embodiment of the invention, the LWC composition contains containing from 10 to 60 volume percent of a cement composition that includes type III Portland Cement; from 20 to 78 volume percent of expanded polymer particles having an average particle diameter of from 0.2 mm to 5 mm, a bulk density of from 0.032 g/cc to 0.56 g/cc, and an aspect ratio of from 1 to 2; from 15 to 35 volume percent of sand and/or fine aggregate, where at least a portion of the sand and/or fine aggregate has a fineness modulus of less than 2; from 5 to 15 volume percent coarse aggregate; and from 0.1 to 1 volume percent of one or more additives selected from anti-foam agents, water-proofing agents, dispersing agents, set-accelerators, set-retarders, plasticizing agents, superpiasticizing agents, freezing point decreasing agents, adhesiveness-improving agents, colorants and combinations thereof; where the sum of components used does not exceed 100 volume percent and where after the lightweight cementitious composition is set, it has a compressive strength of at least 1700 psi, in some embodiments at least 2000 psi, as tested according to ASTM C39 after seven days.<br>
The LWC compositions can be used in most, if not all, applications where traditional concrete formulations are used. As non-limiting examples, the present LWC compositions can be used in structural and architectural applications, non-limiting examples being party walls, ICF or SIP structures, bird baths, benches, shingles, siding, drywall, cement board, decorative pillars or archways for buildings, etc., furniture or household applications such as counter tops, in-floor radiant heating systems, floors (primary and secondary), tilt-up walls, sandwich wall panels, as a stucco coating, road and airport safety applications such as arresting walls, Jersey Barriers, sound barriers and walls, retaining walls, runway arresting systems, air entrained concrete, runaway truck ramps, flowable excavatable backfill, and road construction applications such as road bed material and bridge deck material.<br>
Additionally, LWC articles according to the invention readily accept direct attachment of screws, as a non-limiting example drywall screws and nails, which can be attached by traditional, pneumatic, or powder actuated devices. This allows easy attachment of materials such as plywood, drywall,<br><br>
studs and other materials commonly usedI in the construction industry, which cannot be done using traditional concrete formulations.<br>
When the LWC compositions of the invention are used in road bed construction, the polymer particles can aid in preventing and or minimizing crack propagation, especially when water freeze-thaw is involved.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the set and/or hardened LWC compositions according to the invention are used in structural applications and can have a minimum compressive strength for load bearing masonry structural applications of at least 1700 psi (119.5 kgf/cm2), in other cases at least 1800 psi (126.5 kgf/cm2), in some instances at least 1900 psi, and in other instances at least 2000 psi (140.6 kgf/cm2). For structural lightweight concrete the compositions can have a minimum compressive strength of at least 2500 psi (175.8 kgf/cm2). Compressive strengths are determined according to ASTM C39 at seven days.<br>
Although ASTM C39 can be consulted for precise details, and is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, it can be summarized as providing a test method that consists of applying a compressive axial load to molded cylinders or cores at a rate which is within a prescribed range until failure occurs. The testing machine is equipped with two steel bearing blocks &gt;    with hardened faces, one which is a spherically seated block that will bear on the upper surface of the specimen, and the other a solid block on which the specimen rests. The load is applied at a rate of movement (platen to crosshead measurement) corresponding to a stress rate on the specimen of 35+ 7 psi/s (0.25 + 0.05 Mpa/s). The compressive load is applied until the load indicator shows that the load is decreasing steadily and the specimen displays a well-defined fracture pattern. The compressive strength is calculated by dividing the maximum load carried by the specimen during the test by the cross-sectional area of the specimen.<br>
The compositions of the invention are well suited to the fabrication of molded construction articles and materials, non-limiting examples of such include wall panels including tilt-up wall panels, T beams, double T beams, roofing tiles, roof panels, ceiling panels, floor panels, I beams, foundation walls and the like. The compositions exhibit greater strength than prior art LWC compositions.<br><br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the molded construction articles and materials can be pre-cast and/or pre-stressed.<br>
As used herein, "pre-casf concrete refers to concrete poured into a mold or cast of a required shape and allowed to cure and/or harden before being taken out and put into a desired position.<br>
As used herein, "pre-stressed" concrete refers to concrete whose tension has been improved by using prestressing tendons (in many cases high tensile steel cable or rods), which are used to provide a clamping load producing a compressive strength that offsets the tensile stress that the concrete member would otherwise experience due to a bending load. Any suitable method known in the art can be used to pre-stress concrete. Suitable methods include, but are not limited to pre-tensioned concrete, where concrete is cast around already tensioned tendons, and post-tensioned concrete, where compression is applied after the pouring and curing processes.<br>
A particular advantage that the present invention provides is that the set concrete composition and/or molded construction articles formed from such compositions can be readily cut and/or sectioned using conventional methods as opposed to having to use specialized concrete or diamond tipped cutting blades and/or saws. This provides substantial time and cost savings when customizing concrete articles.<br>
The compositions can be readily cast into molds according to methods well known to those of stall in the art for, as non-limiting examples, roofing tiles, paver, or other articles in virtually any three dimensional configuration desired, including configurations having certain topical textures such as having the appearance of wooden shakes, slate shingles or smooth faced ceramic tiles. A typical shingle can have approximate dimensions often inches in width by seventeen inches in length by one and three quarter inches in thickness. In the molding of roofing materials, the addition of an air entrapment agent makes the final product more weatherproof in terms of resistance to freeze/thaw degradation.<br>
When foundation walls are poured using the LWC compositions of the invention, the walls can be taken above grade due to the lighter weight. Ordinarily, the lower part of the foundation wall has a tendency to blow<br><br>
outwards under the sheer weight of the concrete mixture, but the lighter weight of the compositions of the invention tend to lessen the chances of this happening. Foundation walls prepared using the present LWC compositions can readily take conventional fasteners used in conventional foundation wall construction.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the concrete compositions according to the invention are formed, set and/or hardened in the form of a concrete masonry unit As used herein, the term "concrete masonry unit" refers to a hollow or solid concrete article including, but not limited to scored, split face, ribbed, fluted, ground face, slumped and paving stone varieties. Embodiments of the invention provide walls that include, at least in part, concrete masonry units made according to the invention.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the molded construction articles and materials and concrete masonry units described above are capable of receiving and holding penetrating fasteners, non-limiting examples of such include nails, screws, staples and the like. This can be beneficial in that surface coverings can be attached directly to the molded construction articles and materials and concrete masonry units molded construction articles and materials and concrete masonry units.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, a standard 2 Yz inch drywall screw can be screwed into a poured and set surface containing the present light weight concrete composition, to a depth of 1 Vz inches, and is not removed when a force of at least 500, in some cases at least 600 and in other cases at least 700 and up to 800 pounds offeree is applied perpendicular to the surface screwed into for one, in some cases five and in other cases ten minutes.<br>
The present invention is also directed to buildings that include the LWC compositions according to the invention.<br>
The present invention also provides a method of making an optimized lightweight concrete article that includes:<br>
identifying the desired density and strength properties of a set lightweight concrete composition;<br><br>
determining the type, size and density olpolymer beads to be expanded for use in the light weight concrete composition; determining the size and density the polymer beads are to be<br>
expanded to; expanding the polymer beads to form expanded polymer beads; dispersing the expanded polymer beads in a cementitious<br>
mixture to form the light weight concrete composition; and allowing the light weight concrete composition to set in a desired form. The desired density and strength properties of the set and/or hardened LWC composition are determined based on the intended application.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the type, size and density of polymer beads to be expanded and the size and density the polymer beads are to be expanded to can be determined based on empirical and/or published data.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention finite element analysis can be used to determine the type, size and density of polymer beads to be expanded and the size and density the polymer beads are to be expanded to. The resulting lightweight concrete composition is allowed to set and/or harden to provide LWC articles and concrete masonry units as described above.<br>

Unless otherwise indicated, all compositions were prepared under laboratory conditions using a model 42N-5 blender (Charles Ross &amp; Son Company, Hauppauge, NY) having a 7-ft3 working capacity body with a single shaft paddle. The mixer was operated at 34 rpm. Conditioning was performed in a LH-10 Temperture and Humidity Chamber (manufactured by Associated Environmental Systems, Ayer, MA). Samples were molded in 6" x 12" single use plastic cylinder molds with flat caps and were tested in triplicate. Compression testing was performed on a Forney FX250/300 Compression Tester (Forney Incorporated, Hermitage, PA), which hydraulically applies a vertical load at a desired rate. All other peripheral materials (slump cone, tamping rods, etc.) adhered to the applicable ASTM test method. The following ASTM test methods and procedures were followed:<br>

Example 1<br>
Polystyrene in unexpanded bead form (M97BC - 0.65mm, F271T-0.4mm, and F271M - 0.33 mm) was pre-expanded into EPS foam (prepuff) particles of varying densities as shown in the table below.<br><br>
The data show that the prepuff particle size varies inversely with the expanded density of the material.<br>
Example 2<br>
Polystyrene in unexpanded bead form (0,65mm, 0.4mm, and 0.33 mm) was pre-expanded into prepuff particles with a bulk density of 2 lb/ft3 as shown in the table below. The prepuff particles were formulated into a LWC composition, in a 3.5 cubic foot drum mixer, that included 46.5 wt.% (25.3 vol.%) Portland cement, 16.3 wt.% (26.3 vol.%) water, and 1.2 wt.% (26.4 vol.%) prepuff particles.   The resulting LWC compositions had a concrete<br><br>
density of 90 lb/ft2. Tha average~cx&gt;mpressfre st^	according<br>
to ASTM C39, seven day break test) is shown in the table below.<br><br>
The data show that as the mean unexpanded bead size decreases, at a constant prepuff particle density, that surprisingly higher compressive strength does not necessarily result from ever decreasing unexpanded bead size as suggested in the prior art. More particularly, the data show that an optimum unexpanded bead size with respect to compressive strength at 2.00 pcf exists when loaded to obtain 90 pcf concrete density. This optimum appears to be between 330 microns and 650 microns for this particular formulation.<br>
Example 3<br>
Since the prepuff particle density also impacts the overall concrete density, changing the EPS density requires a change in the EPS loading level to maintain a constant concrete density. This relationship holds only as long as the total amount of prepuff particles is not so large as to compromise the strength of the surrounding concrete matrix. The relationship between the prepuff particle density and loading level provides additional opportunities to optimize concrete strength while controlling the overall concrete density.<br>
Polystyrene in unexpanded bead form (0.65mm) was pre»expanded into prepuff particles having varying densities as shown in the table below. The prepuff particles were formulated into LWC compositions containing the components shown in the table below, in a 3.5 cubic foot drum* mixer, and each having a concrete density of 90 lb/ft3.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The data show that as prepuff particle density in the LWC composition increases at constant concrete density, the compressive strength of the LWC<br>
increases.<br>

Polystyrene in unexpanded bead form was pre-expanded into prepuff particles having various densities as shown in the table below. The prepuff particles were formulated into LWC compositions, in a 3.5 cubic foot drum mixer, containing the components shown in the table below.<br><br>
The data show that desirable light weight concrete can be obtained using the prepuff of the present invention and expanded slate as aggregate in light weight concrete compositions.<br><br>

The following examples demonstrate the use of expanded slate as an aggregate used in combination with the prepuff particles of the present invention. Polystyrene in unexpanded bead form was pre-expanded into prepuff particles having various densities as shown in the table below. The prepuff particles were formulated into LWC compositions, in a 3.5 cubic foot drum mixer, containing the components shown in the table below.<br><br>
One-foot square, 4 inch thick concrete forms were made by pouring formulations prepared according to examples X and Y in the table below into forms and allowing the formulations to set for 24 hours.<br><br><br><br>
while slate containing concrete did notreadily accept fasteners. This' represents an improvement over the prior art as the time consuming practice of fixing anchors into the concrete to enable the fasteners to grip thereto can be eliminated.<br>
Example 11<br>
One-foot square, 4 inch thick concrete forms were made by pouring the formulations of Examples X and Y into forms and allowing the formulations to set for 24 hours. After 7 days, a one-foot square, Vz inch sheet of standard drywall sheet was fastened directly to the formed concrete using standard 1 % inch drywall screws. A minimum of one-inch screw penetration was required for adequate fastening. The results are shown in the table below.<br><br>
The data demonstrates that the present light-weight concrete composition, without slate, provides superior gripping capability compared to traditional expanded slate formulations, which did not readily accept fasteners. This represents an improvement over the prior art as the time consuming practice of fastening nailing studs to the concrete to allow for attaching the drywall thereto can be eliminated.<br>
Example 12<br>
Two-foot square, 4 inch thick concrete forms were made by pouring the formulations Examples X and Y into a form and allowing the formulations to set for 24 hours. After 7 days, a three foot long, 2"x4" stud was fastened directly to the formed concrete using standard 16d nails. A minimum of two-inch nail penetration was required for adequate fastening. The results are shown in the table below.<br><br><br>
The data demonstrates that the present light-weight concrete composition, without slate, provides superior gripping capability compared to traditional expanded slate formulations, which did not readily accept fasteners. This represents an improvement over the prior art as the expensive and time consuming practice of using TAPCON® (available from Illinois Tool Works Inc., Glenview, Illinois) or similar fasteners, lead anchors, or other methods known in the art to fasten studs to concrete can be eliminated.<br><br><br>
The data showsjhat tfreaverage prepuff size required to provide maximum compressive strength compositions is dependant, to some degree, on the expansion factor of the prepuff. Focusing on average prepuff size alone does not provide a good indicator of maximum potential concrete strength. This point is illustrated by comparing examples BB and FF. Example FF (1.54 mm size) does not provide maximum compressive strength at an 18X expansion factor, yet it is near the maximum strength that can be obtained from beads expanded 48X.<br>
Using a combination of prepuff size and expansion factor can provide an indicator for maximum concrete strength. As an example, example AA (prepuff size, 1.35 mm and expansion factor 48) provides 93 pcf concrete with a compressive strength of 1750 psi while a similarly sized prepuff, example II (prepuff size 1.41 mm and expansion factor 12) provides 90 pcf concrete with a significantly higher compressive strength of 2100 psi. Thus smaller prepuff size and a lower expansion factor can provide higher compressive strength in the present light weight concrete composition within an optimum range of prepuff particle size.<br>
Example 14<br>
Concrete with expanded slate as an aggregate was made using the ingredients shown in the table below.<br><br><br>
The data indicates that while the EPS volume required to maintain approximately 90 pcf density concrete decreases somewhat linearly as the slate concentration increases; the present lightweight concrete's strength increases exponentially as the amount of slate in the formulation increases. This relationship highlights the potentially significant impact of including aggregates in the present light weight concrete formulation and demonstrates the potential for optimizing the amount of EPS and aggregates in the formulation to maximize strength at a desired density. In addition, the cost of various components can also be included in such a design and the light weight concrete formulation can be optimized for both maximum strength and lowest cost.<br>
Example 15<br>
Concrete with unexpanded EPS (1037C) and no additional aggregate was made using the ingredients shown in the table below.<br><br><br>
The data show that unexpanded polystyrene resin beads (-40 pcf bulk density) can provide a lightweight concrete composition having surprisingly high compressive strength (2500-3200 psi) at low density (76-100 pcf).<br>
Example 16<br>
PrepufffromlF271T bead expanded to 1.2 lb/ft3, F271C bead expanded to 1.3 lb/ft3 and M97BC bead expanded to 1.5 Ib/ft^ere evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The surface and inner cells of each are shown in FIGS. 20 and 21 (F271T), 22 and 23 (F271C)f and 24 and 25 (M97BC) respectively.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 25, 27 and 29, the external structure of the prepuff particles was generally sphereical in shape having a continuous surface outer surface or skin. As shown in FIGS. 26, 28 and 30, the internal cellular structure of the prepuff samples resembles a honeycomb-type sturcture.<br>
The size of the prepuff particles was also measured using SEM, the results are shown in the table below.<br><br><br>
Taken with all of the data presented above, the data provide an indication that internal cellular structure might affect the strength of a light weight concrete formulation.<br>
When used in light weight concrete compositions, the prepuff particles can impact the overall strength of the concrete in two ways. First, the larger particles, which have a lower density, change the concrete matrix surrounding the prepuff particle and secondly, the lower density prepuff particle is less rigid due to the cell structure of the foamed particle. Since the strength of the concrete depends, at least to some extent, on the strength of the prepuff particles, increased prepuff particle strength should result in greater light weight concrete strength. The potential strength increase can be limited by the extent to which it impacts the concrete matrix. The data in the present examples suggest that the original bead particle size can be optimized to provide an optimally sized prepuff particle (which is controlled by the prepuff density), which results in the highest possible lightweight concrete strength.<br>
In other words, within an optimum prepuff particle size and optimum density range, the wall thickness of the prepuff will provide sufficient support to allow the present light weight concrete composition to have better strength than light weight concrete compositions in the prior art.<br>
The data presented herein demonstrate that unlike the presumption and approach taken in the prior art, expanded EPS particles can do surprisingly more than act simply as a void space in the concrete. More specifically, the structure and character of the prepuff particles used in the present invention can significantly enhance the strength of the resulting light weight concrete composition.<br><br>
Example 17<br>
This example demonstrates the use of fasteners with the present light weight concrete composition and related pull-out strength.   This evaluation was used to compare the load capacity of a screw directly installed in the present light weight concrete (approximately 90 pcf) with conventional concrete fasteners installed in normal weight and traditional lightweight concrete.<br>
Fastener pullout testing was performed on three types of concrete: normal weight, 143 pcf (sample MM, 140 pcf normal concrete), lightweight concrete using expanded slate (123 pcf) (sample NN, 120 pcf LWC), and lightweight concrete with EPS (87 pcf) (sample 00,90 pcf LWC) made as described above according to the formulations in the following table.<br><br>
An apparatus was built that allowed weights to be hung vertically from each fastener using gravity to apply a load in line with the axis of the fastener. The 90 pcf LWC had 2 Vz standard drywall screws directly installed to approximately 1 Yz depth. The 120 pcf LWC had two types of fasteners<br><br>
installed into predrilled holes: 2 V* TAPCON* metal screw-type masonry fastening anchors (Illinois Tool Works Inc., Glenview, IL) installed approximately 2" deep and standard 2 YS expanding wedge-clip bolt/nut anchors installed approximately 1 %" deep. The 140 pcf normal concrete also had two types of fasteners installed into predrilled holes: 2 V* TAPCON anchors installed approximately 2" deep and standard 2 %" expanding wedge-clip bolt/nut anchors installed approximately 1 V* deep. One of the drywall screws in the light weight concrete was backed out and re-installed into the same fastener hole for testing. Also one of the TAPCON screws was removed and reinstalled to evaluate any loss in capacity. The following tables show the data and loadings for each anchor/fastener tested.<br>
■ -   -     -	■	■	■	■<br>
The holding power of the drywall screws in the 90 pcf LWC was surprisingly high as they did not easily break or tear from the concrete. The drywall screws were easy to install, only requiring a standard size electric drill. The gripping strength of the drywall screws in the 90 pcf LWC was such that If the applied drilling torque was not stopped before the screw head reached the surface of the concrete, the head of the screw would twist off. All of the<br><br>
fasteners held the 740 lbs, of load for at least 10 minutes except the backed out and re-inserted drywall screw in the 90 pcf LWC, which held 700 lbs. for 30 seconds before tearing loose from the concrete. This drywall screw did not break at the failure point, but pulled out of the concrete.<br>
Taking the above data as a whole, it has been demonstrated that an optimum prepuff bead size exists (as a non-limiting example, approximately 450 - 550 //m resin beads expanded to an expansion factor of approximately 10-20 cc/g to a prepuff diameter of approximately 750 to 1400 //m for 90 pcf lightweight concrete) to maximize the compressive strength of the present light weight concrete formulations. The compressive strength of the present light weight concrete formulations can be increased by increasing the present EPS prepuff bead density. Unexpanded polystyrene resin (-40 pcf bulk density) yields 1WC of high compressive strength (2500-3200 psi) considering the low density (76-100 pcf). Aggregates can be used in the present light weight concrete formulations. The present light weight concrete formulations, without course aggregates, provide a concrete composition, which may be directly fastened to using standard drills and screws. When the EPS prepuff beads are expanded to low bulk densities (for example

Concrete with EPS (expanded F271C bead) and was made using the ingredients shown in the table below using the methods described above except that a Mortarman 120 mixer (IMER USA inc., Capital Heights, MD) was used for mixing and 4" x 8" cylinders were used instead of 6" x 12" cylinders for testing.<br><br><br>
The results demonstrate that higher strength can be obtained in the present lightweight concrete compositions when sand with a lower fineness modulus is used.<br>
