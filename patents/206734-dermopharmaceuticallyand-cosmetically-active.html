Dermopharmaceutically and cosmetically active oligopeptides<br>
The present invention relates to pharmaceutically, dermopharmaceutically and cosmetically active oligopeptides, to derivatives thereof, to peptide analogs and derivatives thereof as well as to the use thereof in dermopharmaceutically and cosmetically active compositions.<br>
The basic mechanism of skin aging is known to take place in the extracellular matrix, the so-called basal lamella/ when situated at the intersection between epithelium and connective tissue. Regeneration of the extracellular matrix is highly important as it considerably influences the behaviour of those cells that are in contact with it, in particular their growth, migration, proliferation, form and functions. An age-related reduction of collagen synthesis by fibroblasts occurs in this extracellular matrix, the consequence of which being a reduced number of chemical substances secreted by these cells. As skin proteins consist by approx. 80% of collagen, already a small natural decrease of the collagen concentration in the tissue may have clear consequences on the mechanical and physiological properties of skin.<br>
Katayama et al. (The Journal of Biological Chemistry, Vol. 268, No. 14, pages 9941-9944, 1993) found that the minimal subfragment sequence for stimulating collagen and fibronectin is represented by the pentapeptide Lys-Thr-Thr-Lys-Ser. Sequences with four amino acids or less have a slighter or no stimulating effect.<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
The European patent application WO 00/15188 describes the effect of the palmitoylated pentapeptide Palm-Lys-Thr-Thr-Lys-Ser as a component tor treating skin aging, accelerating wound healing and improving skin moisturizing.<br>
It has been found that selected, new oligopeptides and derivatives thereof as well as peptide analogs and derivatives thereof (in the following referred to as ,,compounds of the present invention") are surprisingly highly pharmaceutically and/or cosmetically effective and are particularly appropriate for use in dermopharmaceutically and/or cosmetically effective compositions. The compounds of the present invention diffuse rapidly and in sufficient concentration through the cell membrane up to the intracellular site of action, where they lead to a clearly increased production of collagen and fibronectin. Thus, the compounds of the present invention exert a surprisingly positive and stimulating effect on the extracellular matrix which decisively influences the mechanical and physiological appearance of skin. In particular, the compounds of the present invention induce a much more rapid and stronger stimulation of collagen synthesis than known so far for other compounds from the state of the art. The quicker and stronger stimulation of collagen synthesis by the compounds of the present invention is probably the result of a synergic effect which is obtained by reduction, of the molecular mass, introduction of N-methyl groups in amino acids and modification of amino acids with, e.g., fatty acid esters. However, the present invention is not bound to this explanation.<br><br>

Example 2:  Determination of the fibronectin content after treatment with the oligopeptide derivatives of the present invention Method:<br>
The fibronectin (laminin or collagen VII) content  in the fibroblast cells is determined by immuno-dot blotting. Cultivation and incubation of the cells are carried out in the same way as described in Example 1. Afterwards, the cells are lysed and the lysates (0.5 ml) are blotted on a nitrocellulose sheet in a prepared bio-dot device. The sheets are then incubated with a specific primary antibody to human fibronectin according to the western blotting method. A conjugate with alkaline phosphatase is used as the secondary antibody. The intensity of the bands is visually determined semi-quantitatively after dying and stopping of the reaction. The results are shown in Table 2.<br>

Examples 5-7:<br>
The following embodiments 5-7 describe the synthesis of the compounds of formula  (I) of the present invention and of salts of such compounds. The eluates and products obtained according to the examples are analysed using proton NMR, HPLC-electrospray MS or elementary analysis. The compounds can be manufactured according to known methods described hereinafter  (general  instructions from M.  Bodanszky  "The Practice of Peptide Synthesis", Springer, 2nd Edition, 1994). Accordingly, the amino acid, e.g. serine, is bound to a resin at the carboxy terminal end in a solid-phase synthesis, whereby its amino group is protected by a protective group, e.g.  by  the  Fmoc protective  group.  The  side  chain  is protected with,  e.g.,  Boc or t-butyl.  If necessary,  the protective groups are selectively split off in order to link up the further amino acid derivatives with the reagents commonly used in peptide synthesis until the desired chain is completely built up.  Afterwards,  the peptide or peptide analog, respectively, is split off from the resin at the carboxy  terminal  end  and  this  carboxy terminal  end  is<br><br>
- 19 -<br>
connected with varying C(O)-R7, SO2-R7, C(O)-OR7 or C(O)-N(R7)2 residues, whereupon the protective groups are removed.<br>
Example 5: H-Lys-Thr-Ser-Orn-Ser x 3 TFA<br>
Synthesis of H-Lys(Boc)-Thr(tBu)-Ser(tBu)-Orn(Boc)-Ser(tBu)-<br>
OH x TFA (5a):<br>
In a typical solid-phase synthesis protocol, the pentapeptide<br>
is obtained by repetitive coupling of 18.7 g  {14.0 mmol,<br>
charge: 0.75 mmol/g) of commercial H-Ser(tBu)-chlorotrityl<br>
resin with 16.8 mmol of the amino acids Fmoc-Orn (Boc) -OH,<br>
Fmoc-Thr(tBu)-OH (2x), Fmoc-Lys(Boc)-OH, 18 mmol TBTU, 33.6<br>
mmol collidin and unblocking with 1% DBU in DMF (2x5 min) ,<br>
splitting from the resin with 1% TFA in dichloromethane and<br>
purification over Sephadex LH20®, yield: 9.3 g (64%).<br>
Synthesis of H-Lys-Thr-Ser-Orn-Ser-OH x 3TFA (5b): 9.3 g of 5a is stirred for 1 hour at RT in a mixture composed of 59 ml of TFA, 1.25 ml of water and 1.25 ml of triisopropylsilan. After reduction to 1/3 of the volume, precipitation with diethylether is carried out, yield: 6.0 g (76%).<br>
Example 6:<br>
Synthesis of CH3- (CH2) 7-SO2-Lys-Thr-Ser-Orn-Ser x 2 TFA (6): 2 g (2.2 mmol) of 5a is dissolved in DMF (20 ml) and stirred with 0.48 g (2.3 mmol) of 1-octanesulfochloride and 0.48 g (4,0 mmol) of DIPEA for 10 h at RT. After evaporation of the solvent, the crude product is stirred with 59 ml of TFA, 1.25 ml of water and 1.25 ml of triisopropylsilan for 1 h at RT. After reduction to 1/3 of the volume, precipitation with diethylether and purification over Sephadex LH20® are carried out, yield: 1.4 g (70%).<br><br>

The peptide or conjugate can also be protonized with an inorganic acid, e.g. HC1, HBr, H2SO4 or H3PO4,  or with an organic acid, e.g. formic acid, oxalic acid or tartaric acid, leading to corresponding salts of 6.<br>
Example 7:  H-Dab-Ser-OH x 2 AcOH<br>
According to the described solid-phase protocol from Example<br>
5a, the obtained H-Dab-Ser-OH x 2 TFA (3,0 g, 6.90 mmol) is<br>
analogously transformed in the acetate salt over an ion<br>
exchanger, yield 2.0 g (90.0%).<br>
