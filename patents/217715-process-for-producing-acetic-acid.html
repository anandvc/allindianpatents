Cross-Reference to Related Applications This application is an application filed under 35 U.S.C..§lll(a) claiming benefit pursuant "to .35 U.S.C. §119(e) (-1) of the filing date of the Provisional Application 60/164,153 filed November 8, 1999., pursuant to 35 U.S»q. SHl(b) . Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a catalyst, for use in producing acetic acid, a process for producing the catalyst and a process for producing acetic acid using the catalyst, which are used in the production of acetic acid from ethylene and oxygen by a single-stage catalytic reaction.<br>
Background Art<br>
For producing acetic acid a method of oxidizing acetaldehyde, - a method of reacting methahol and carbon monoxide and a method of oxidizing liquid paraffin are •conventionally used in practice.<br>
The method for producing acetic acid from ethylene through single stage is advantageous in many points in view of the industrial production process and' profitability and a large number of  techniques have been proposed thereon.  Examples thereof include a. liquid phase single-stage oxidation process using an oxidation-reduction catalyst of metal ion pair such as palladium and. cobalt and/or iron (see, Frencn patent No. 1,448,361), and a gas phase single-stage oxidation, process using a catalyst'comprising palladium-phosphoric acid or sulfur-containing modifying agent (see, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publications No. 47-13221 and No. 51-29425), a catalyst comprising a palladium .salt of certain kinds of heterppolyacids (see, Japanese Unexamrhed Patent<br>
Publication No. 54-57488) or a catalyst comprising a 3-group system oxygen compound (see, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 46-6763).<br>
In recent years, a process for producing acetic acid from ethylene and oxygen through a gas phase single stage using a catalyst comprising metal palladium and at least one compound selected from heteropolyacids and/or salts thereof (see, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publications No. 7-89896 and No. 9-67298)-has been proposed.  According to the process using this catalyst, the acetic acid can be obtained in a relatively high yield.<br>
Particularly important matters in industry to take account of in practicing the reaction using such a catalyst are the requirements that the catalyst has high activity, the change in the catalytic activity by aging is as small as possible and the selectivity of acetic acid is good.<br>
Those conventionally proposed methods where acetic acid is obtained from ethylene and oxygen through a gas phase single stage using a catalyst comprising palladium and at least one compound selected from heteropolyacids and/or salts thereof are satisfied in view of practice in an industrial scale, however, if the catalytic activity can be more improved, this is economically advantageous. Disclosure of Invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a higher performance catalyst, a process for producing the catalyst, and a process for producing acetic acid using the catalyst, which are used in the process for producing acetic acid from ethylene and oxygen by a gas phase single-stage reaction using a catalyst comprising palladium and at least one compound selected from heteropolyacids and/or salts thereof.<br>
For attaining the above-described object, the present inventors have made extensive investigations to elevate the performance of the catalyst comprising palladium and at least one compound selected from<br>

The particle size of the support for use in the present invention (I) is also not particularly limited but it is preferably from 1 to 10 mm, more preferably from 3 to 8 mm.  In the case of performing the reaction by filling the catalyst in a tube reactor, if the particle size is less than 1 mm, a pressure loss may be generated on passing of the gas.therethrough and the gas may not be effectively circulated.

The pore structure.of the support is not particularly limited but the pore diameter is preferably from 1 to 1,000 nm, more preferably from 2 to 800 nm.<br>
The structure of the catalyst of the invention (I) is not accurately recognized, but the (a) palladium is preferably palladium in a metal state and the compound of group (b) has a clear structure, different from a composite oxide, and is acidic.  The element of group (c) is considered to exist in the quite vicinity of (a) and (b).  Thus, the catalyst is considered to exhibit higher activity and a catalytic performance with smaller change by aging as compared with conventional catalysts due to the interaction among the (a) palladium, the compound of group (b) and the element of group (c).<br>
In the catalyst of the present invention (I) comprising a support having held thereon the (a) palladium, the compound of group (b) and the element of group (c), the composition of (a), (b) and (c) is preferably such that (a) is from 0.1 to 10 wt%, (b) is from 0.1 to 90 wt%, and (-c) is in terms of the weight ratio to (b), in the range of the compound of group (b) : the element of group (c) = 1 : 0.0001 to 0.2, more preferably such that (a) is from 0.5 to 5.0 wt%, (b) is from 1.0 to 50 wt%, and (c) is in terms of the weight ratio to (b), in the range of the compound of group (b) : the element of group (c) = I : 0.0001 to 0.2, for attaining better results.<br>
Particularly, in the catalyst of the invention (I), where the compound containing the element of group (c) is a heteropolyacid containing the vanadium element and/or molybdenum element (hereinbelow referred to as heteropolyacid of group (c)) and/or its salt, the composition of (a), (b) and (c) is preferably such that (a) is from 0.1 to 10 wt%, (b) is from 0.1 to 90 wt%, and (c) is in terms of the weight ratio to (b), in the range<br>
of the compound of group (b):the element of group (c) = 1:0.005 .to 0.2, more preferably such that (a) is from 0.1 to 5.0 wt%, (b) is from 0.1 to 50 wt%, and (c) is in terms of the weight ratio to (b), in the range of the compound of group (b):the heteropolyacid of group (c) = 1:0.005 to 0.2, for attaining better results.<br>
The heteropolyacids and/or their salts are considered to have various hydrous structures in the catalyst of the present invention.  The weight for the heteropolyacids and/or their salts as used herein refers . to a value calculated for the molecular formula of an anhydrous compound.<br>
According to the catalyst for use in producing acetic acid described in the claims and the detailed description of the invention of Japanese Unexamined Patent Publications No. 7-89896 and No. 9-67298 cited hereinabove as the background arts, one constituent element of the catalyst is a vanadium element and/or a molybdenum element as the element of group (c), however, the effectiveness of a catalyst containing the compound of group (b) and the element of group (c) in a specific proportion is not described.  The present inventors have intensively studied on this point.<br>
As a result, it has'been surprisingly found that in the constituent elements of the catalyst for use in producing acetic acid according to the present invention (I), when the weight ratio of the compound of group (b) to the element of group (c) is in the range of the compound of group (b) : the element of group (c) = 1 : 0.0001 to 0.2, preferably 1 : 0.0002 to 0.15, the space time yield of acetic acid is elevated and the catalyst is reduced in the change by aging.<br>
The reason why the catalytic activity is improved and the change by aging is reduced when the compound of group (b) and the element of group (c) are mixed at a specific weight ratio is not yet accurately elucidated at present but is presumed as follows.<br>
It has hitherto been known that vanadium and molybdenum are used as an oxidation catalyst, but the vanadium element and/or the molybdenum element alone is not effective for the process for producing acetic acid from ethylene through a single stage.  In fact, it has been confirmed, as shown in the Examples, that they cannot provide a high activity in the process for producing acetic acid from ethylene through a single stage.  Even in the combination of the (a) palladium and the vanadium element and/or molybdenum element (c) or the combination of the compound of group (b) and the vanadium element and/or molybdenum element (c), acetic acid could •not be obtained with a high activity.  Further, it has been proved that the catalytic activity and the selectivity of acetic acid vary depending on the proportions of the element of group (c) added to the catalyst consisting of the (a) palladium and the compound of group (b), and there are ranges in the proportions in which the catalytic performance is improved or deteriorated as compared with conventional ones.  Thus, it has been found from the results of extensive studies that the ratio of the element of group (c) to the compound of group (b) is important.<br>
For example, when the weight ratio of the element of group (c) to the compound of group (b) is as small as less than the compound of group (b):the element of group (c) = 1:0.0001, a sufficient interaction may not caused between the compound of group (b) and the element of group (c) and the effect may not be brought out.  On the other hand, when the weight ratio of the element of group (c) to the compound of group (b) is greater than the compound of group (b):the element of group (c) = 1:0.2, the interaction of the element of group (c) to the compound of group (b) may become too large and the reaction activity and selectivity may be reduced to lower the productivity of acetic acid as compared with conventional ones.<br>
Because of these reasons, it is considered that the weight ratio between the compound of group (b) and the element of group (c) has an optimal value.<br>
Further, in the catalysts for producing acetic acid described in the claims and the detailed description of the inve'ntion of Japanese Unexamined Patent Publications No. 7-89896 and No. 9-67298 cited hereinabove, one constituent element of the catalyst is a heteropolyacid containing vanadium and/or molybdenum, i.e., the heteropolyacid of group (c), however, the effectiveness of a catalyst containing the compound of group (b) and at least one compound selected from the group consisting of the heteropolyacids of group (c) and their salts in a specific proportion is not described.  The present * inventors have intensively studied on this point.<br>
As a result, it has been surprisingly found that in the constituent elements of the catalyst for use in producing acetic acid according to the invention (I), when the weight ratio of the compound of group (b) to the at least one compound selected from the group consisting of the heteropolyacids of group (c) and their salts is in the range of the compound of group (b):the at least one compound selected from the group consisting of the heteropolyacids of group (c) and their salts = 1:0.005 to 0.2, preferably 1:0.007 to 0.15, the space time yield of acetic acid is elevated and the catalyst is reduced in the change by aging.  The heteropolyacids and/or their salts are considered to have various hydrous structures in the catalyst of the present invention.  The weight for the heteropolyacids and/or their salts as used herein refers to a value calculated for the molecular formula of an anhydrous compound.<br>
The reason why the catalytic activity is improved and the change by aging is reduced when the compound of group (b) and the at least one compound selected from the group consisting of the heteropolyacids of group (c) and their salts are mixed at a specific weight ratio is not<br>
yet accurately elucidated at present but is presumed as follows.<br>
As described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publications No. 7-89896 and No. 9-67298, where the at least one compound selected from the group consisting of the heteropolyacids of group (c) and their salts is used alone, it exhibits lower activity and selectivity than the compound of group (b).  In fact, the effects have been confirmed in the Examples and Comparative Examples described hereinbelow.  Thus, it can be said that the interaction between the compound (b) and the at least one compound selected from the group consisting of the heteropolyacids of group (c) and their salts is an important factor for the production of acetic acid from ethylene and oxygen.<br>
For example, when the weight ratio of the at least one compound selected from the group consisting of the heteropolyacids of group (c) and their salts to the compound of group (b) is as small as less than the compound of group (b):the element of group (c) = 1:0.005, a sufficient interaction may not caused between the compound of group (b) and the at least one compound selected from the group consisting of the heteropolyacids of group (c) and their salts and the effect may not be brought out.<br>
On the other hand, when the weight ratio of the at least one compound selected from the group consisting of the heteropolyacids of group (c) and their salts to the compound of group (b) is greater than the compound of group (b):the at least one compound selected from the group consisting of the heteropolyacids of group (c) and their salts = 1:0.2, it is considered that the reaction activity and selectivity are reduced and the change by aging are increased as compared with a catalyst in which the compound of group (b) is used alone since the amount of the at least one compound selected from the group consisting of the heteropolyacids of group (c) and their<br>
salts is increased.<br>
Because of these reasons, it is considered that the weight ratio between the compound of group (b) and the at least one compound selected from the group consisting of the heteropolyacids of group (c) and their salts has an optimal value.<br>
Catalyst of the Invention (II)<br>

Example 30 and Comparative Example 21<br>
Each of Catalyst 19 for use in producing acetic acid obtained in Example 19 and Catalyst 25 for use in producing acetic acids Comparative Example 16 was packed in an SUS316 reaction tube (inner diameter 25 mm).  A gas obtained by mixing ethylene, oxygen, water, and nitrogen in a ratio of 10:6:25:59 was introduced at a space velocity of 1800 hr-1 at a shell temperature of 180°C and a reaction pressure of 0.8 MPa (gauge pressure) to cause a reaction obtaining acetic acid from the ethylene and oxygen.  The generated gas was cooled and the cooled condensate and gas components were analyzed by gas chromatography (Shimadzu Science, GC-14B, FID, and TCD). The activity of each catalyst was calculated as the weight of the acetic acid produced per volume of catalyst<br>
(liter) per hour (space-time yield STY/unit g/hlcat). The selectivity was calculated as a percent of the product with respect to the ethylene.<br>
The change by aging of the STY of the acetic acid is shown in Fig. 2 as the result of the reaction.<br>
Example 31<br>
69 g of a silica support (made by Sudchemie, KA-1, 5 mm diameter) was immersed in 45 ml of an aqueous solution of 2.76 g of sodium tetrachloropalladate, 0.14 g of zinc chloride (made by Wako Pure Chemical Industry, ZnCl2), and 0.78 g of tetrachloroaurate 4-hydrate (made by Tanaka<br>
Kikinzoku Kogyo, H4AuCl4 • 4H20) to cause full absorption. Next, this was added to 100 ml of an aqueous solution of 8.2 g of sodium metasilicate 9-hydrate and the result allowed to stand at room temperature for 20 hours.  Next, 5.75 g of hydrazine 1-hydrate was added to this and the result gently stirred, then this was allowed to stand at room temperature for 4 hours to reduce it to metal palladium.  Next, the catalyst was filtered out and the result decanted, then transferred to a glass column equipped with a stopcock and washed by flushing with pure water for 40 hours.  Next, the result was dried under a flow of air at 110°C for 4 hours to obtain a metal palladium-supported catalyst containing zinc and gold.<br>
Next, the above metal palladium-supported catalyst containing zinc and gold was impregnated with 45 ml of an aqueous solution of 0.266 g of sodium tellurite (made by Wako Pure Chemical industry, Na2Te03) .  The result was air dried for I hour, then transferred to a glass column equipped with a stopcock and washed by flushing with pure water for 16 hours.  The result was dried under a flow of air at 110°C for 4 hours to obtain a metal palladium-supported catalyst containing zinc, gold, and tellurium.<br>
Next, the above metal palladium-supported catalyst containing zinc, gold, and tellurium was impregnated with 45 ml of an aqueous solution of 23.43 g of silicotungstate 26-hydrate (made by Japan Inorganic<br>
Colour &amp; Chemical, H4SiW12040.26H20) , 0.326 g of silicovanadomolybdate 30-hydrate (made by Japan Inorganic<br>
Colour &amp; Chemical, H4PV1Mo11O40 30H20) , and 0.206 g of manganese nitrate 6-hydrate (Wako Pure Chemical Industry,<br>
Mn(N03)2.6H20).  The addition was performed once.  The mixture was stirred and rotated gently until the solution was sufficiently absorbed (about 3 minutes).  After impregnation, the support impregnated with moisture was allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 hour.  Next, the result was dried in an oven in air at 110°C for 4 hours, then was allowed to stand in a desiccator overnight.  Due to this, Catalyst 26 used for producing acetic acid was obtained.<br>
Example 32<br>
The same procedure was followed as in Example 31 to obtain Catalyst 27 used for producing acetic acid except that instead of the manganese nitrate 6-hydrate in Example 31, use was made of 0.214 g of cobalt nitrate 6-hydrate (made by Wako Pure Chemical Industry,<br>
Co(N03)2-6H20) .<br>
Example 33<br>
The same procedure was followed as in Example 31 to obtain Catalyst 28 used for producing acetic acid except that instead of the zinc chloride in Example 31, use was made of 0.283 g of chromium chloride 6-hydrate (made by<br>
Wako Pure Chemical Industry, CrCl3'6H20).<br>
Elementary Analysis of Catalysts for Use in Producing Acetic Acid<br>
The elementary analysis of the metal elements and the heteropolyacids contained in the catalysts for use in producing an acetic acid obtained in Examples 31 to 33 was conducted as follows.  The catalysts for use in producing acetic acids were dissolved by heat treatment under pressure in the presence of 'aqua regia and/or a mixture of fluoric acid and aqua regia.  The components were completely extracted and measured by inductively<br>
coupled plasma (ICP) emission spectrophotometry.  As the ICP spectrophotometric apparatus, use was made of an SPS-1700 made by Seiko Instruments.<br>
Table 5 shows the wt% of the components for Catalysts 26 to 28 for use in producing acetic acid obtained in Examples 31 to 33.  Note that the % in the table shows the wt% with respect to the catalysts. Further, the wt% of the heteropolyacids of the group (b) and the heteropolyacids containing the elements of group (c) were calculated as anhydrides.<br>

Examples 34 to 36<br>
18.5 g of each of the catalysts for use in producing acetic acids obtained in Examples 31 to 33 was packed in an SUS316 reaction tube (inside diameter 25 mm).  A gas obtained by mixing ethylene, oxygen, water, and nitrogen in a ratio of 10:6:15:69 was introduced at a space velocity of 1800 hr-1 at a reaction peak temperature of the catalytic layer of 205°C and a reaction pressure of 0.8 MPa (gauge pressure) to cause a reaction obtaining acetic acid from the ethylene and oxygen.  The generated gas was cooled and the cooled condensate and gas components were analyzed by gas chromatography (Shimadzu Science, GC-14B, FID, and TCD).<br>
The activity of each catalyst was calculated as the weight of the acetic acid produced per volume of catalyst (liter) per hour (space-time yield STY/unit g/hlcat). The selectivity was calculated as a percent of the product with respect to the ethylene.<br>
