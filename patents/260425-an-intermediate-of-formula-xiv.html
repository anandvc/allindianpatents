Example 1<br>
Preparation of 4-(diphenyl-hydroxy-methyl)-benzoic acid<br>
1,4-dibromobenzene (47.2 g, 0.2 M) is added to THF (240 ml). The clear solution is cooled to -65°C. A butyllithium solution (0.22 M, 94 ml of a 20% solution in CHX) is added over 30 minutes.<br>
After 5 minutes of stirring a solution of benzophenone (36.4 g, 0.2 M in 180 ml THF) is added over 30 minutes (exothermic). The mixture is stirred for a further 30 minutes at -65°C. Then over 30 minutes the temperature is raised to -10°C and the solution is stirred at this temperature for one hour.<br>
The reaction mixture is then re-cooled to -65°C. Over 30 minutes a butyllithium solution (0.22 M, 94 ml of a 20% solution in cyclohexane) is added.<br>
The resulting suspension is diluted with 200 ml THF. Then carbon dioxide gas is introduced over 90 minutes at -65°C. The temperature is raised to 2O°C and the mixture stirred overnight. The mixture is then cooled to 0°C and an aqueous solution of ammonium chloride (120 ml of a 10% solution) is added over 30 minutes. 4-(diphenyl-hydroxy-methyl)-benzoic acid is formed at this stage.<br>
The mixture is evaporated at 45°C under a vacuum. The residue is adjusted to pH 4 with acetic acid and mixed with 400 ml H20. Extraction is performed with 2 x 150 ml ethyl acetate. The organic phases are extracted again with 100 ml water. The combined EST-phases are shaken with a 10% aqueous potassium hydroxide solution (2 x 120 ml). The combined aqueous phases are adjusted to pH 1-2 with hydrochloric acid at 2O°C and then extracted with 2 x 150 ml TBME. The combined TBME phases are mixed with 50 ml water and 50 ml saturated Na2S04l dried with magnesium sulphate and evaporated at 45°C under vacuum to obtain a crude product.<br>
38.3 g crude product is dissolved in TBME (300 ml) at 4O°C. The clear yellow solution is concentrated in a volume of 60 ml (240 ml TBME distilled off). The mixture is stirred for one hour at 4O°C (crystallisation). 50 ml HPTF is added, the mixture is cooled to 0°C and stirred<br><br>
at O°C for 1 hour. Evaporating and washing with 2 x 15 ml heptane fraction and drying overnight at 45°C under vacuum gives white crystals.<br>
Attachment of4-(diphenyl-hydroxy-methyl)-benzoic acid to a solid phase<br>
15g 4-(diphenyl-hydroxy-methyl)-benzoic acid with 7.54 g hydoxybenzotriazole is dissolved in 140 ml DMF by stirring for 15 min. 15.3 ml di-isopropylcarbo-di-imide is added and the solution kept at room temperature for 30 min. The solution is then stirred overnight at room temperature in the presence of aminomethylated polystyrene. After washing with DMF, methanol and THF the linker derivatised support is dried under vacuum.<br>
Example 2<br>
Preparation of 4-(diphenyl•hydroxy-methyl)-benzoic acid (alternative method)<br>
To 12 It TBME in a well dried 100 It Hastelloy-Reactor, 3,0 kg n-butyllithium (20% in cyclohexane; 9,37 mol) is added during a period of 20 min, keeping the temperature at -5°C (clear solution). During a period of 30 min 2,00 kg 1,4-dibromobenzene (8,48 moi) dissolved in 16 I TBME is added keeping the temperature between -5° and O°C. The addition container is rinsed with 3 I TBME.<br>
After 30 min stirring at -5°C a solution of 1,55 kg benzophenone (8,50 mol) in 8 It TBME is added during a period of 20 min keeping the temperature between -5° and O°C. The addition container is rinsed with 3 It TBME. A very small amount of a white solid is formed. After 15 min stirring at -5°C a process control sample (HPLC 1) is taken. The reaction mixture is stirred for further 25 min at -5°C and warmed up to +25°C.<br>
3,2 kg n-butyllithium (20% in cyclohexane; 10,00 mol) is added during a period of 25 min keeping the temperature between +25 and 27°C. The addition is slightly exothermic and the colour turned to slightly green. Some precipitate and froth are formed. After 20 min stirring a process control sample is taken (HPLC 2). Depending on the result of HPLC 2 further 0,3 kg n-buthyllithium is added after stirring at +25°C for 35 min. After 15 min stirring a sample for process control is taken (HPLC 3). The lines of the n-buthyllithium addition are rinsed with 1,5 It TBME and the reaction is cooled to -10°C.<br><br>
1,99 kg dry ice (solid C02) is added portionwise during a period of 20 min keeping the temperature between -10 and -5°C. The reaction is exothermic and a slightly yellow precipitate is formed. After 15 min stirring at -10°C 11 I TBME are added and the reaction mixture is warmed to O°C. 5 118% aqueous hydrochloric acid is added during a period of 15 min keeping the temperature between 0° and +5°C. The addition is exothermic and the precipitate is dissolved (pH 
The clear solution is transferred to a separation tank and the reactor is rinsed with 5 It TBME. After separation of the aqueous phase the organic phase is washed with 20 It water. After separation of the two layers the organic phase is extracted with 13 It 5% aqueous KOH solution. The basic water phase is separated and the organic layer is extracted again with 13 It 5% aqueous KOH solution. The combined basic aqueous layers are transferred to the 100 It Hastelloy-Reactor. 22 I of. TBME and 6 I aqueous 18% hydrochloric acid are added over a period of 20 min at a temperature between 0° and +5°C. The addition is exothermic and a white precipitate is formed but it dissolves again at a low pH-value (pH ½ 1 after HCI-addition). The mixture is stirred during 10 min and transferred to a separation tank. The layers are separated and the aqueous phase is extracted again with 16 I TBME. After separation of the layers the combined organic phases are concentrated at 500 mbar / 45 °C JT to a volume of 4-5 I (32 I TBME are destilled off) and seed crystals are added. The temperature is raised up to 5O°C and 20 I HPTF are added slowly with good stirring. The white precipitate is stirred for 2 h at 5O°C JT. The jacked temperature is regulated at O°C and stirring is continued over night (16 h) letting cool down the suspension to O°C. The white suspension is filtered off and the reactor is rinsed 5 times with 5 It of the mother liquor. The residue is dried at 45°C JT under vacuum (&gt;10 mbar) to constant weight (over night).<br>
Example 3<br>
Preparation  of Fmoc-(2S,4R)-Pro(4-OCO-NH-CH2-CH2-NH-BocyOH  starting  from   Cbo-<br>
(2S,4R)-Pro(4-OH)-OMe<br>
1. Dimethylaminopyridine (30.5 g, 250 mmol) and Cbo-(2S,4R)-Pro(4-OH)-OMe (34.9 g, 125 mmol) are dissolved in toluene (870 ml). A solution of 4-nitrophenylchloroformate (31.5 g, 157 mmol) in toluene (206 ml) is added dropwise to this solution at O°C to 5 °C over 20 minutes and stirred for an additional 2 hours. This is followed by addition of a solution of Boc-ethylenediamine (80.1  g,  500 mmol)  in toluene (205 ml) and stirring at ambient<br><br>
temperature for 12 hours. A solution of concentrated sulfuric acid (43.7 g, 450 mmol) in water (873 ml) is then added while maintaining a temperature of 20 °C to 25 °C. The white suspension is filtered by suction and washed with toluene (30 ml). The toluene phase is washed with water (450 ml), sodium carbonate (10% w/w, 450 ml) and three times with water (450 ml each). The toluene phase is azeotropically dried by distilling off 300 ml, which is continuously replaced by dry toluene (2 x 300 ml). Heptane (130 ml) is added to the dry toluene solution at 50 °C and cooled to 0°C over two hours. The precipitated product is filtered, washed two times with toluene/heptane 1:2 v/v (70 ml), and dried at 50 °C under vacuum to leave Cbo-(2S,4R)-Pro(4-OCO-NH-CH2-CH2-NH-Boc)-OMe as a white solid.<br>
2.	Cbo-(2S,4R)-Pro(4-OCO-NH-CH2-CH2-NH-Boc)-OMe (20.0 g, 43.0 mmol) is dissolved in a 1:1 mixture of tetrahydrofuran and methanol (380 ml). A 1 M sodium hydroxide solution (51.6 ml) is added and the resulting mixture stirred for 4 hours at ambient temperature. The mixture is adjusted to pH 3 by adding sulfuric acid (50 ml, 1 M). Tetrahydrofuran and methanol are distilled off at 50 °C and 50 mbar until no further solvents distil. The remaining milky solution is diluted with isopropyl acetate (113 ml) and water (57 ml), the phases are separated and the isopropyl acetate phase is washed with sodium chloride solution (10%, 113 ml). The solvent is distilled off (50 °C, 50 mbar) to yield a foam of Cbo-(2S,4R)-Pro(4-OCO-NH-CH2-CH2-NH-Boc)-OH (19.8 g), which was used without further purification in the next reaction.<br>
3.	Palladium on charcoal (10%, 1.94 g, 0042 mmol) is added to a solution of Cbo-(2S,4R)-Pro(4-OCO-NH-CH2-CH2-NH-Boc)-OH (19.4 g, 43.0 mmol) in isopropanol (350 ml) and water (37 ml). Hydrogen is bubbled through this mixture for 4 hours, the catalyst is filtered off, and the residue is washed with a mixture of isopropanol (50ml) and water (50 ml). The isopropanol/ water phase is azeotropically dried by distilling off 2/3 of the volume, which is continuously replaced by a toluene/isopropanol mixture (1:1 v/v). The remaining dry solution is concentrated in vacuoXo dryness (50 °C, 200 mbar) to leave (2S,4R)-Pro(4-OCO-NH-CH2-CH2-NH-Boc)-OH as a brownish solid, which was used without further purification.<br>
4.	(2S,4R)-Pro(40CO-NH-CH2-CH2-NH-Boc)-OH (5.0 g, 15 mmol) is dissolved in a mixture of water (25 ml) and triethylamine (1.5 g, 15 mmol) at 40 °C. A solution of Fmoc-<br><br>
OSu (4.65 g, 14 mmol) in acetonitrile (25 ml) is added to the clear solution over 30 minutes and stirred for 2 hours. Then the reaction mixture is adjusted to pH 3 with hydrochloric acid (1 m, 13 ml) and stirred for a further hour. Acetonitrile is distilled off (40 °C, 80 mbar) and replaced by isopropyl acetate, affording a two-phase mixture. The lower aqueous phase is separated off, whilst the remaining organic layer is washed with water and distilled two times with replacement with isopropylacetate and then concentrated to a brownish foam. This foam is dissolved in isopropylacetate (25 ml) and added dropwise to heptane (200 ml) whereby the product is precipitated. The solid is filtered, washed with isopropylacetate/heptane and dried in vacuo at 40 °C to leave Fmoc-(2S,4R)-Pro(4-OCO-NH-CH2-CH2-NH-Boc)-OH.<br>
Example 4<br>
