BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	The present invention provides compounds,<br>
pharmaceutical compositions containing one or more of those compounds or their pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts, which are effective in inhibiting the binding or function of various chemokines, such TECKr to the CCR9 receptor. As antagonists or modulators for the CCR9 receptor, the compounds and compositions have utility in treating inflammatory and immune disorder conditions and diseases.<br>
[0003]	Chemokines are chemotactic cytokines that are released<br>
by a wide variety of cells and attract various types of immune system cells, such as macrophages, T cells, eosinophils, basophils and neutrophils, to sites of inflammation (reviewed in Schail, Cytokine, 3:165-183 (1991), Schali, et at., Curr. Opin. Immunol., 6:865 873 (1994) and Murphy, Rev, Immun.. 12:593-633 (1994)).  In addition to stimulating chemotaxis, other changes can be selectively induced by chemokines in responsive cells, including changes in cell shape, transient rises in the concentration of intracellular free calcium ions ([Ca2+]), granule exocytosis, integrin up-regulation, formation of bioactive lipids (e.g., ieukotrienes) and respiratory burst, associated with leukocyte activation. Thus, the chemokines are early triggers of the inflammatory response, causing inflammatory mediator release, chemotaxis and extravasation to sites of infection or inflammation.<br>
[0004]	T lymphocyte (T cell) infiltration into the small intestine<br>
and colon has been linked to the pathogenesis of Coeliac diseases, food allergies, rheumatoid arthritis, human inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) which include Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.  Blocking trafficking of<br><br>
relevant T cell populations to the intestine can lead to an effective approach to treat human IBD. More recently, chemokine receptor 9 (CCR9) has been noted to be expressed on gut-homing T cells in peripheral blood, elevated in patients with small bowel inflammation such as Crohn's disease and celiac disease. The only CCR9 ligand identified to date, TECK (thymus-expressed chemokine) is expressed in the small intestine and the ligand receptor pair is now thought to play a pivotal role in the development of IBD.  In particular, this pair mediates the migration of disease causing T cells to the intestine.  See for example, Zabalios, et a/., J. Immunol., 162(10):5671-5675 (1999); KunkeL et a/., J. Exp. Med. 192(5):761-768 (2000); Papadakis, et a/., J. Immunol., 165(9):5069~5076 (2000); Papadakis, et a/., Gastroenterology, 12l(2):246-254 (2001); Campbell, etai, J. Exp. /Wed, 195(1):135-141 (2002); Wurbel, et a/., Blood, 98(9):2626-2632 (2001); and Uehara, et ai, J. Immunol, 168(6):2811-2819 (2002).<br>
[0005]	The identification of compounds that modulate the<br>
function of CCR9 represents an attractive new family of therapeutic agents for the treatment of inflammatory and other conditions and diseases associated with CCR9 activation, such as inflammatory bowel disease.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
General<br>
[0014]	The present invention is directed to compounds and salts<br>
thereof, compositions and methods useful in the modulation of chemokine receptor function, particularly CCR9 function. Modulation of chemokine receptor activity, as used herein in its various forms, is intended to encompass antagonism, agonism, partial antagonism, inverse agonism and/or partial agonism of the activity associated with a particular chemokine receptor, preferably the CCR9 receptor. Accordingly, the compounds of the present invention are compounds which modulate at least one function or characteristic of mammalian CCR9, for example, a human CCR9 protein. The ability of a compound to modulate the function of CCR9, can be demonstrated in a binding assay (e.g., ligand binding or agonist binding), a migration assay, a signaling assay (e.g., activation of a mammalian G protein, induction of rapid and transient increase in the concentration of cytosolic free calcium), and/or cellular response assay (e.g., stimulation of chemotaxis, exocytosis or inflammatory mediator release by leukocytes).<br><br>

Certain specific compounds of the present invention contain both basic and acidic functionalities that allow the compounds to be converted into either base or acid addition salts.<br>
[0034]	The neutral forms of the compounds may be regenerated<br>
by contacting the salt with a base or acid and isolating the parent compound in the conventional manner. The parent form of the compound differs from<br><br>
the various salt forms in certain physical properties, such as solubility in polar solvents, but otherwise the salts are equivalent to the parent form of the compound for the purposes of the present invention.<br>
[0035]	"Salt thereof refers to a compound formed when the<br>
hydrogen of an acid is replaced by a cation, such as a metal cation or an organic cation and the like.  Preferably, the salt is a pharmaceutical^-acceptable salt, although this is not required for sails of intermediate compounds which are not intended for administration to a patient.<br>
[0036]	In addition to salt forms, the present invention provides<br>
compounds which are in a prodrug form. Prodrugs of the compounds described herein are those compounds that readily undergo chemical changes under physiological conditions to provide the compounds of the present invention. Additionally, prodrugs can be converted to the compounds of the present invention by chemical or biochemical methods in an ex vivo environment.  For example, prodrugs can be slowly converted to the compounds of the present invention when placed in a transdermal patch reservoir with a suitable enzyme or chemical reagent.<br>
[0037]	"Therapeutically effective amount" refers to an amount<br>
sufficient to effect treatment when administered to a patient in need of treatment.<br>
[0038]	"Treating" or "treatment" as used herein refers to the<br>
treating or treatment of a disease or medical condition (such as a bacterial infection) in a patient, such as a mammal (particularly a human or a companion animal) which includes:<br>
[0039]	ameliorating the disease or medical condition, i.e.,<br>
eliminating or causing regression of the disease or medical condition in a patient;<br>
[0040]	suppressing the disease or medical condition, i.e.:<br>
slowing or arresting the development of the disease or medical condition in a patient: or<br>
[0041]	alleviating the symptoms of the disease or medical<br>
condition in a patient.<br><br>
[0042]	Certain compounds of the present invention can exist in<br>
unsolvated forms as well as solvated forms, including hydrated forms. In general, both solvated forms and unsolvated forms are intended to be<br>
encompassed within the scope of the present invention. Certain compounds of the present invention may exist in multiple crystalline or amorphous forms (i.e., as polymorphs).   In general, all physical forms are equivalent for the uses contemplated by the present invention and are intended to be within the scope of the present invention.<br>
[0043]	Certain compounds of the present invention possess<br>
asymmetric carbon atoms (optical centers) or double bonds; the racemates, diastereomers, geometric isomers and individual isomers (e.g., separate enantiomers) are ail intended to be encompassed within the scope of the present invention. The compounds of the present invention may also contain unnatural proportions of atomic isotopes at one or more of the atoms that constitute such compounds.  For example, the compounds may be radiolabeled with radioactive isotopes, such as for example tritium (3H), iodine-125 (125l) or carbon-14 (14C). All isotopic variations of the compounds of the present invention, whether radioactive or not, are intended to be encompassed within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Compounds that Modulate CCR9 Activity<br>
[0044]	The present invention provides compounds that modulate<br>
CCR9 activity. Specifically, the invention provides compounds having antiinflammatory or immunoregulatory activity. The compounds of the invention are thought to interfere with inappropriate T-cell trafficking by specifically modulating or inhibiting a chemokine receptor function.  Chemokine receptors are integral membrane proteins which interact with an extracellular ligand, such as a chemokine, and mediate a cellular response to the ligand: e.g., chemotaxis, increased intracellular calcium ion concentration, etc. Therefore, modulation of a chemokine receptor function, e.g.. interference with a chemokine receptor ligand interaction, will modulate a chemokine receptor mediated response, and treat or prevent a chemokine receptor mediated<br><br>
condition or disease. Modulation of a chemokine receptor function includes both inducement and inhibition of the function. The type of modulation accomplished will depend on the characteristics of the compound, i.e., antagonist or full, partial or inverse agonist.<br>
[0045]	Without intending to be bound by any particular theory, rt<br>
is believed that the compounds provided herein interfere with the interaction between a chemokine receptor and one or more cognate ligands. In particular, it is believed that the compounds interfere with the interaction between CCR9 and a CCR9 figand, such as TECK. Compounds contemplated by the invention include, but are not limited to, the exemplary compounds provided herein and salts thereof.<br>
[0046]	For example, compounds of this invention act as potent<br>
CCR9 antagonists, and this antagonistic activity has been further confirmed in animal testing for inflammation, one of the hallmark disease states for CCR9. Accordingly, the compounds provided herein are useful in pharmaceutical compositions, methods for the treatment of CCR9-mediated diseases, and as controls in assays for the identification of competitive CCR9 antagonists.<br>
CCR9 antagonists as treatments of cancer<br>
[0047]	In additional to inflammatory diseases, cancers that are<br>
caused by uncontrolled proliferation of T cells may be treated with a CCR9 antagonist. Certain types of cancer are caused by T cells expressing chemokine receptor CCR9. For example, thymoma and thymic carcinoma are diseases in which cancer cells are found in the tissues of the thymus, an organ where lymphocyte development occurs. T cells in the thymus, called thymocytes, are known to express functional CCR9; its ligand is highly expressed in the thymus. Another example is the acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), also called acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute, is a common leukemia, which can occur in children as well as adults. Recent studies have shown that T cells in patients with ALL selectively express high level of CCR9 (Qiuping Z et al., Cancer Res. 2003, 1;63(19):6469-77)<br><br>
[0048]	Chemokine receptors have been implicated in cancer.<br>
Although the exact mechanisms of chemokine receptors1 involvements have yet to be full understood, such receptors are known to promote the growth of cancer cells (proliferation), facilitate the spread of cancer cells (metastasis) or help them resist program cell death (apoptosis). For example, CCR9 in a cancer T cell line MOLT-4 provides the cells with a survival signal, allowing them to resist apoptosis (Youn BS, et aL, Apoptosis. 2002 Jun;7(3);271-6). In the cases of thymoma, thymic carcinoma and acute lymphocytic leukemia, it is likely that CCR9 plays a key in the survival and proliferation these cells. Thus, blocking the signaling of CCR9 should help prevent their expansion and metastasis.<br>

Methods of Treating CCR9-mediated Conditions or Diseases<br>
[00102]	In yet another aspect, the present invention provides<br>
methods of treating or preventing a CCR9-mediated condition or disease by<br>
administering to a subject having such a condition or disease a therapeutically<br>
effective amount of any compound of formula (I) above. Compounds for use<br>
in the present methods include those compounds according to formula (I),<br>
those provided above as embodiments, those specifically exemplified in the<br>
Examples below, and those provided with specific structures herein. The<br>
"subject" is defined herein to include animals such as mammals, including, but<br>
not limited to, primates (e.g., humans), cows, sheep, goats, horses, dogs,<br>
cats, rabbits, rats, mice and the like. In preferred embodiments, the subject is<br>
a human-<br>
tOOl 03]	As used herein, the phrase "CCR9-mediated condition or<br>
disease" and related phrases and terms refer to a condition or disease<br>
characterized by inappropriate, i.e., less than or greater than normal, CCR9<br>
functional activity.  Inappropriate CCR9 functional activity might arise as the<br>
result of CCR9 expression in cells which normally do not express CCR9,<br>
increased CCR9 expression (leading to, e.g., inflammatory and<br>
immunoregulatory disorders and diseases) or decreased CCR9 expression.<br>
Inappropriate CCR9 functional activity might also arise as the result of TECK<br>
secretion by cells which normally do not secrete TECK, increased TECK<br>
expression (leading to, e.g., inflammatory and immunoregulatory disorders<br>
and diseases) or decreased TECK expression. A CCR9-mediated condition<br>
or disease may be completely o\~ partially mediated by inappropriate CCR9<br>
functional activity.  However, a CCR9-mediated condition or disease is one in<br>
which modulation of CCR9 results in some effect on the underlying condition<br><br>
ur disease (e.g., a CCR9 antagonist results in some improvement in patient well being in at least some patients).<br>
[00104]	The term "therapeutically effective amount" means the<br>
amount of the subject compound that will elicit the biological or medical response of a cell, tissue, system, or animal, such as a human, that is being sought by the researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other treatment provider.<br>

Measuring efficacy of CCR9 modulators<br>
In vitro assays<br>
[00276]	A variety of assays can be used to evaluate the<br>
compounds provided herein, including signaling assays, migration assays, and other assays of cellular response. CCR9 receptor signaling assays can be used to measure the ability of a compound, such as a potential CCR9 antagonist, to block CCR9 ligand- (e.g. TECK)-induced signaling. A migration<br><br>
assay can be used to measure the ability of a compound of interest, such as a possible CCR9 antagonist, to block CCR9-mediated ceil migration in vitro. The latter is believed to resemble chemokine-induced cell migration in vivo.<br>
[00277]	In a suitable assay, a CCR9 protein (whether isolated or<br>
recombinant) is used which has at least one property, activity, or functional characteristic of a mammaiian CCR9 protein. The property can be a binding property (to, for example, a ligand or inhibitor), a signaling activity (e.g., activation of a mammalian G protein, induction of rapid and transient increase in the concentration of cytosolic free calcium [Ca+T]), cellular response function (e.g., stimulation of chemotaxis or inflammatory mediator release by leukocytes), and the like.<br>
[00278]        The assay can be a cell based assay that utilizes cells stably or transiently transfected with a vector or expression cassette having a nucleic acid sequence which encodes the CCR9 receptor. The cells are maintained under conditions appropriate for expression of the receptor and are contacted with a putative agent under conditions appropriate for binding to occur.  Binding can be detected using standard techniques.  For example, the extent of binding can be determined relative to a suitable control (for example, relative to background in the absence of a putative agent, or relative to a known iigand). Optionally, a cellular fraction, such as a membrane fraction, containing the receptor can be used in lieu of whole cells.<br>
[00279]	Detection of binding or complex formation can be<br>
detected directly or indirectly.  For example, the putative agent can be labeled with a suitable label (e.g., fluorescent label, chemiluminescent label, isotope label, enzyme label, and the like) and binding can be determined by detection of the label. Specific and/or competitive binding can be assessed by competition or displacement studies, using unlabeled agent or a ligand (e.g., TECK) as a competitor.<br>
[00280]	Binding inhibition assays can be used to evaluate the<br>
present compounds. In these assays, the compounds are evaluated as inhibitors of ligand binding using, for example, TECK.  In this embodiment, the CCR9 receptor is contacted with a ligand such as TECK and a measure of<br><br>
ligand binding is made. The receptor is then contacted with a test agent in the presence of a iigand (e.g., TECK) and a second measurement of binding is made. A reduction in the extent of ligand binding is indicative of inhibition of binding by the test agent. The binding inhibition assays can be carried out using whole cells which express CCR9, or a membrane fraction from cells which express CCR9.<br>
[00281]	The binding of a G protein coupled receptor by, for<br>
example, an agonist, can result in a signaling event by the receptor. Accordingly, signaling assays can also be used to evaluate the compounds of the present invention and induction of signaling function by an agent can be monitored using any suitable method. For example, G protein activity, such as hydrolysis of GTP to GDP, or later signaling events triggered by receptor binding can be assayed by known methods (see, for example, PCT/US97/15915; Neote, ef a/., Cell, 72:415425 (1993); Van Riper, ef a/., J. Exp. Med,, 177:851-856 (1993) and Dahinden, ef a/., J. Exp. Med., 179:751-756(1994)).<br>
[00282]	Chemotaxis assays can also be used to assess receptor<br>
function and evaluate the compounds provided herein. These assays are based on the functional migration of cells in vitro or in vivo induced by an agent, and can be used to assess the binding and/or effect on chemotaxis of ligands, inhibitors, or agonists. A variety of chemotaxis assays are known in the art, and any suitable assay can be used to evaluate the compounds of the present invention. Examples of suitable assays include those described in PCT/US97/15915; Springer, et a/., WO 94/20142; Berman ef a/., Immunol. Invest, 17:625-677 (1988); and Kavanaugh etaL, J. Immunol., 146:4149-4156(1991)).<br>
[00283]	Calcium signaling assays measure calcium concentration<br>
over time, preferably before and after receptor binding. These assays can be used to quantify the generation of a receptor signaling mediator, Ca++, following receptor binding (or absence thereof). These assays are useful in determining the ability of a compound, such as those of the present invention, in npnerate the receDtor signaling mediator by binding to a receptor of<br><br>
interest. Also, these assays are useful in determining the ability of a compound, such as those of the present invention, to inhibit generation of the receptor signaling mediator by interfering with binding between a receptor of interest and a Iigand.<br>
[00284]	In calcium signaling assays used to determine the ability<br>
of a compound to interfere with binding between CCR9 and a known CCR9 iigand, CCR9-expressing cells (such as a T ceil line MOLT-4 cells) are first incubated with a compound of interest, such as a potential CCR9 antagonist, at increasing concentrations. The cell number can be from 105 to 5X105 cells per well in a 96-weII microliter pl3te. The concentration of the compound being tested may range from 0 to 100 uM. After a period of incubation (which can range from 5 to 60 minutes), the treated cells are placed in a Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader (FLIPR®) (available from Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The FLIPR system is well known to those skilled in the art as a standard method of performing assays. The cells are then stimulated with an appropriate amount of the CCR9 Iigand TECK (e.g. 5-100 nM final concentration) and the signal of intracellular calcium increase (also called calcium flux) is recorded. The efficacy of a compound as an inhibitor of binding between CCR9 and the iigand can be calculated as an IC50 (the concentration needed to cause 50% inhibition in signaling) or IC90 (at 90% inhibition).<br>
[00285]	In vitro cell migration assays can be performed (but are<br>
not limited to this format) using the 96-well microchamber (called ChemoTX™). The ChemoTX system is well known to those skilled in the art as a type of chemotactic/cell migration instrument. In this assay, CCR9-expressing cells (such as MOLT-4) are first incubated with a compound of interest, such as a possible CCR9 antagonist, at increasing concentrations. Typically, fifty thousand cells per well are used, but the amount can range from 103-106 cells per well. CCR9 Iigand TECK, typically at 50 nM (but can range from 5-100 nM), is placed at the lower chamber and the migration apparatus is assembled. Twenty microliters of test compound-treated cells are then placed onto the membrane. Migration is allowed to take place at 37 C for<br><br>
a period of time, typically 2.5 hours. At the end of the incubation, the number of cells that migrated across the membrane into the lower chamber is then quantified. The efficacy of a compound as an inhibitor of CCR9-mediated cell migration is calculated as an IC50 (the concentration needed to reduce cell migration by 50%) or IC90 (for 90% inhibition).<br>
In vivo efficacy models for human 1BD<br>
[00286]	T eel! infiltration into the small intestine and colon have<br>
been linked to the pathogenesis of human inflammatory bowel diseases which include Coeliac disease, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Blocking trafficking of relevant T cell populations to the intestine is believed to be an effective approach to treat human IBD. CCR9 is expressed on gut-homing T cells in peripheral blood, elevated in patients with small bowel inflammation such as Crohn's disease and Coeliac disease. CCR9 ligand TECK is expressed in the small intestine. It is thus believed that this ligand-receptor pair plays a role in IBD development by mediating migration of T cells to the intestine. Several animal models exist and can be used for evaluating compounds of interest, such as potential CCR9 antagonists, for an ability to affect such T cell migration and/or condition or disease, which might allow efficacy predictions of antagonists in humans.<br>
Animal models with pathology similar to human ulcerative colitis<br>
[00287]	A murine model described by Panwala and coworkers<br>
(Panwala, et aL J Immunol, 161(10);5733-44 (1998)) involves genetic deletion of the murine multi-drug resistant gene (MDR). MDR knockout mice (MDR-/-) are susceptible to developing a severe, spontaneous intestinal inflammation when maintained under specific pathogen-free facility conditions. The intestinal inflammation seen in MDR-/- mice has a pathology similar to that of human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and is defined by Th1 type T cells infiltration into the lamina propria of the large intestine.<br>
[00288]	Another murine model was described by Davidson et ai,<br>
J Exp Med., 184(1):241-51(1986). In this model, the murine IL-10 gene was deleted and mice rendered deficient in the production of interleukin 10 (IL-10-<br><br>
/-). These mice develop a chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that predominates in the colon and shares histopathological features with human IBD.<br>
[00289]	Another murine mode! for IBD has been described by<br>
Powrie etai, Int Immunol., 5(11):1461-71 (1993), in which a subset of CD4-f T cells (called CD45RB(high)) from immunocompetent mice are purified and adoptively transferred into immunodeficient mice (such as C.B-17 scid mice). The animal restored with the CD45RBhighCD4+ T cell population developed a lethal wasting disease with severe mononuclear cell infiltrates in the colon, pathologically similar with human IBD.<br>
Murine models with pathology similar to human Crohn's disease<br>
[00290]	The TNF ARE(-M model. The role of TNF in Crohn's<br>
disease in human has been demonstrated more recently by success of treatment using anti-TNF alpha antibody by Targan et a/., N Engl J Med,, 337(15):1029-35 (1997). Mice with aberrant production of TNF-alpha due to genetic alteration in the TNF gene (ARE-/-) develop Crohn's-like inflammatory bowel diseases (see Kontoyiannis et a/., Immunity, 10(3):387-98 (1999)).<br>
[00291]	The SAMP/yit model. This is model described by<br>
Kosiewicz et aL, J Clin Invest, 107(6);695-702 (2001). The mouse strain, SAMP/Yit, spontaneously develops a chronic inflammation localized to the terminal ileum. The resulting ileitis is characterized by massive infiltration of activated T lymphocytes into the lamina propria, and bears a remarkable resemblance to human Crohn's disease.<br>
Example 119<br>
[00292]	This example illustrates the activity associated with<br>
representative compounds of the invention.<br>
Materials and Methods (in vitro assays)<br>
Reagents and cells<br><br>
[00293]	MOLT-4 cells were obtained from the American Type<br>
Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured in RPMI tissue culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37° C. Recombinant human chemokine protein TECK was obtained from R&amp;D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). ChemoTX0 chemotaxis microchambers were purchased from Neuro Probe (Gaithersburg, MD). CyQUANT® cell proliferation kits were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, Oregon). Calcium indicator dye Fluo-4 AM was purchased from Molecular Devices (Mountain View, CA).<br>
Conventional migration assay<br>
[00294]	Conventional migration assay was used to determine the<br>
efficacy of potential receptor antagonists in blocking migration mediated through CCR9. This assay was routinely performed using the ChemoTX® microchamber system with a 5-urn pore-sized polycarbonate membrane. To begin such an assay, MOLT-4 cells were harvested by centrifugation of cell suspension at 1000 PRM on a GS-6R Beckman centrifuge. The cell pellet was resuspended in chemotaxis buffer (HBSS with 0.1% BSA) at 5x106 celts/mL Test compounds at desired concentrations were prepared from 10 mM stock solutions by serial dilutions in chemotaxis buffer. An equal volume of cells and compounds were mixed and incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes. Afterwards, 20 JJ.L of the mixture was transferred onto the porus membrane of a migration microchamber, with 29 p.L of 50 nM chemokine TECK protein placed at the lower chamber. Following a 150-minute incubation at 37° C, during which cells migrated against the chemokine gradient, the assay was terminated by removing the cell drops from atop the filter. To quantify cells migrated across the membrane, 5 |j.L of 7X CyQUANT® solution was added to each well in the lower chamber, and the fluorescence signal measured on a Spectrafluor Plus fluorescence plate reader (TECAN, Durham, NC). The degree of inhibition was-determined by comparing migration signals betweeen compound-treated and untreated cells. IC50 calculation was further<br><br>
performed by non-linear squares regression analysis using Graphpad Prism (Graphpad Software, San Diego, CA).<br>
RAM assay<br>
[00295]	The primary screen to identify CCR9 antagonists was<br>
carried out using RAM assay (WO 02101350), which detects potential hits by their ability to activate cell migration under inhibitory TECK concentration. To begin such an assay, MOLT-4 cells were harvested by centrifugation of cell suspension at 1000 RPM on a GS-6R Beckman centrifuge. The cell pellet was resuspended in chemotaxis buffer (HBSS/0.1% BSA) at 5x106 cells/mL Twenty-five microliters of cells was mixed with an equal volume of a test compound diluted to 20 \xM in the same buffer. Twenty microliters of the mixture was transferred onto the filter in the upper chemotaxis chamber, with 29 p.L of 500 nM chemokine protein TECK placed in the lower chamber. Following a 150-minute incubation at 37° C, the assay was terminated by removing the ceil drops from atop the fitter. To quantify cells migrated across the membrane, 5 jaL of 7X CyQUANT® solution was added to each well in the lower chamber, and the fluorescence signal measured on a Spectrafluor Plus fluorescence plate reader (TECAN, Durham, NC).<br>
[00296]	For selection of potential hits, the level of migration<br>
activation was calculated as a RAM index-the ratio between the signal of a particular well and the median signal of the whole plate. Compounds with a RAM index of greater than 1.8 were regarded as RAM positive, and were selected for IC50 determinations in conventional functional assays.<br>
Calcium flux assay<br>
[00297]	Calcium flux assay measures an increase in intracellular<br>
calcium following ligand-induced receptor activation. In the screen of CCR9<br>
antagonists, it was used as a secondary assay carried out on a FLIPR®<br>
machine (Molecular Devices, Mountain View, CA). To begin an assay, MOLT-<br>
4 cells were harvested by centrifugation of cell suspension, and resuspended<br>
to 1.5x105cells/ml_in HBSS (with 1% fetal calf serum). Cells were then<br><br>
labeled with a calcium indicator dye FIuo-4 AM for 45 minutes at 37° C with gentle shaking. Following incubation, cells were pelletted, washed once with HBSS and resuspended in the same buffer at a density of 1.6x105cells/mL One hundred microliters of iabeied ceils were mixed with 10 jiL of test compound at the appropriate concentrations on an assay plate. Chemokine protein TECK was added at a final concentration of 25 nM to activate the receptor. The degree of inhibition was determined by comparing calcium signals between compound-treated and untreated cells. IC50 calculations were further performed by non-linear squares regression analysis using Graphpad Prism (Graphpad Software, San Diego, CA).<br>
Discovery of CCR9 antagonists<br>
[00298]	The discovery of CCR9 antagonists was carried out in<br>
two steps: First, RAM assay was used to screen a compound library in a high-throughput manner. The assay detected compounds by their ability to cause a positive migration signal under RAM condition. Secondly, RAM positive compounds were tested to determine their IC50S using the conventional migration and calcium flux assays.<br>
[00299]	For instance, in a screen of approximately 100,000<br>
compounds, 2000 individual wells representing approximately 2% of total compounds showed a RAM index greater than 1.8. These compounds were cheery-picked and retested in duplicate wells by RAM assay. A total of 270 compounds, or 0.27% of the library, were confirmed RAM positives.<br>
[00300]	Since a RAM positive signal indicates only the presence<br>
of a receptor antagonist and not how strongly it blocks receptor functions, the RAM positive compounds were further tested for potency in calcium flux assay using MOLT-4 cells. IC50 determinations on this subset discovered<br><br><br>
In vivo efficacy studies<br>
[00301]	The MDR1a-knockout mice, which lack the P-<br>
giycoprotein gene, spontaneously develop colitis under specific pathogen-free condition. The pathology in these animals has been characterized as Th1-type T cell-mediated inflammation similar to ulcerative colitis in humans. Disease normally begins to develop at around 8-10 weeks after birth. However the ages at which disease emerges and the ultimate penetrance level often vary considerably among different animal facilities.<br>
[00302]	In a study using the MDR1a-knockout mice, the CCR9<br>
antagonist shown below<br><br>
was evaluated by prophylactic administration for its ability to delay disease onset. Female mice (n=34) were dosed with 50 mg/kg twice a day by subcutaneous injections for 14 consecutive weeks starting at age 10 weeks. The study showed that the compound prevented IBD-associated growth retardation. Moreover, the number of mice developing diarrhea was also lower among compound-treated mice (17%), compared to mice receiving vehicle alone (24%)(Figure 1).<br>
