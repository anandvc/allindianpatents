				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising two therapeutically<br>
active substances one of which exerts a potentiating action on the other, and to the use of<br>
said composition.<br>
It is known that the efficacy of therapeutic agents depends on the doses used which,<br>
in the case of partial resistance, necessitates increasing the doses of the therapeutic agents<br>
in order to attain the desired efficacy. This dose increase leads to problems with adverse<br>
effects and acute or chronic toxicity, which may considerably complicate the condition of the<br>
treated patients.<br>
Said partial resistance may turn into complete resistance. In this case, increasing the<br>
dose no longer has any beneficial therapeutic effect; only the toxic effects are observed.<br>
The treatment in such a case consists in changing the therapeutic agent.<br>
This chain of events can repeat itself and lead to the most serious situation: complete<br>
resistance to multiple therapeutic agents (multidrug resistance).<br>
For instance, in particular, immunosuppressed patients become increasingly difficult<br>
to treat and their life expectancy is correspondingly shortened. Moreover, their quality of life<br>
is substantially affected by the administration of high doses of therapeutic agents.<br>
The invention is directed at alleviating these problems by proposing to combine at<br>
least two therapeutically active substances, one of which potentiates the activity of the other,<br>
which not only makes it possible to lower the doses of each therapeutically active substance<br>
but also to treat patients afflicted with infections caused by resistant microorganisms.<br>
In this regard, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition characterized in<br>
that it comprises:<br>
at least one first therapeutically active substance selected from the group<br>
consisting of carveol, thymol, eugenol, borneol, carvacrol, alpha-ionone, beta-ionone, and<br>
the isomers, derivatives and mixtures thereof,<br>
and,<br>
at least one second therapeutically active substance which is an antifungal<br>
agent.<br>
The first therapeutic substance can be obtained by chemical synthesis or from a plant<br>
source.<br>
Preferably, the antifungal agent in the composition of the invention is selected from the<br>
group consisting of the polyenes, the imidazoles, the triazoles, the nucleoside analogues, the<br>
allylamines, the echinocandins, the sordarins, the morpholines, griseofulvin, cyclopiroxolamine,<br>
selenium sulfide, and the mixtures thereof.<br>
More preferably, the antifungal agent is selected from the group consisting of nystatin,<br>
amphotericin B, ketoconazole, econazole, miconazole, clotrimazole, fluconazole, itraconazole,<br>
voriconazole, posaconazole, 5-fluorocytosine, naftafin, terbinafin, caspofungin, amorolfin, and<br>
2<br><br>
the derivatives and mixtures thereof.<br>
A more particularly preferred antifungal composition is a composition in which the first<br>
therapeutically active substance is carvacrol or eugenol, and the antifungal agent is<br>
fluconazole.<br>
Another more particularly preferred antifungal composition is a composition in which the<br>
first therapeutically active substance is carvacrol or eugenol, and the antifungal agent is<br>
selected from voriconazole, caspofungin, itraconazole, 5-fluorocytosine, and the mixtures<br>
thereof.<br>
The invention also proposes a kit characterized in that it comprises at least one first<br>
container containing a first therapeutically active substance selected from the group consisting<br>
of carveol, thymol, eugenol, borneol, carvacrol, alpha-ionone, beta-ionone, and the isomers and<br>
derivatives and mixtures thereof, and at least one second container containing a second<br>
therapeutically active substance which is an antifungal agent.<br>
Lastly the invention proposes a method for treating an infection due to a fungus<br>
characterized in that one administers simultaneously or sequentially to a patient having a fungal<br>
infection, at least one first therapeutically active substance selected from the group consisting<br>
of carveol, thymol, eugenol, borneol, carvacrol, alpha-ionone, beta-ionone, and the isomers and<br>
derivatives and mixtures thereof, and at least one second therapeutically active substance<br>
which is an antifungal agent.<br>
Preferably, in said method, one simultaneously or sequentially administers to a patient<br>
having a fungal infection between 10 and 200 mg/kg of body weight/day of said first<br>
therapeutically active substance, and between 2 and 100 mg/kg of body weight/day of said<br>
second therapeutically active substance which is an antifungal agent.<br>
Preferably, in this method, said first therapeutically active substance is selected from<br>
the group consisting of carvacrol, eugenol and thymol and said second therapeutically active<br>
substance is selected from the group consisting of fluconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, 5-<br>
fluorocytosine and caspofungin, and the mixtures thereof.<br>
The invention will be better understood and other aims and advantages thereof will<br>
appear more clearly in the explanatory description which follows and which refers to the figures<br>
wherein:<br>
Figure 1 presents kinetic test results on a C. albicans culture of the fungicidal<br>
action of fluconazole alone and carvacrol alone as compared with a pharmaceutical<br>
composition according to the invention comprising fluconazole and carvacrol, and<br>
Figure 2 presents the results of in vivo tests in a systemic candidiasis model in<br>
experimentally infected mice either untreated, or treated with fluconazole alone, treated with<br>
carvacrol alone, or treated with a pharmaceutical composition according to the invention<br>
comprising fluconazole and carvacrol.<br>
3<br><br>
The pharmaceutical composition according to the invention comprises as first<br>
therapeutically active substance thymol, eugenol, carvacrol, borneol, carveol, alpha-ionone,<br>
beta-ionone, and the derivatives and isomers as well as any mixtures thereof.<br>
Said compounds have well-known antifungal properties and must be pure.<br>
Thymol, eugenol, carvacrol, borneol, carveol, alpha-ionone, beta-ionone are found in<br>
various proportions in different aromatic plant extracts, that is to say, they can be purified from<br>
such plants. However, they can quite simply be obtained by chemical synthesis.<br>
As a matter of fact, the inventors have now discovered that said compounds have a<br>
potentiating effect on many therapeutically active substances including known antifungal agents<br>
which are already used as medicaments specific in this field.<br>
The second therapeutically active substance comprised in the pharmaceutical<br>
composition of the invention is therefore an antifungal agent, which is already known as such<br>
and already used as medicament specific in this field and whose activity is potentiated.<br>
Examples of known antifungal agents already used as medicaments specific in this field<br>
which can be used in the pharmaceutical composition of the invention, and whose effect will be<br>
potentiated by the first pure therapeutically active substance, belong to three families: the<br>
pyrimidine family represented by 5-fluorocytosine, the azole family represented by fluconazole,<br>
voriconazole, itraconazole and the echinocandin family represented by caspofungin.<br>
Said compounds can be used alone, or in combination with each other. The derivatives<br>
thereof, if they have antifungal activity, can also be used.<br>
Particularly preferred are fluconazole, voriconazole, capsofungin and 5-fluorocytosine<br>
used in combination more particularly with carvacrol, eugenol and/or thymol.<br>
Of course, the pharmaceutical composition according to the invention is not restricted to<br>
the use of only those antifungal agents mentioned above. In fact, considering the potentiating<br>
effect exerted by the first therapeutically active substance defined in the invention, other known<br>
or future antifungal agents can also be successfully used.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition according to the invention can be formulated so as to<br>
be suitable for a simultaneous or sequential administration of said at least first and second<br>
therapeutically active substances.<br>
The pharmaceutical form of the pharmaceutical composition of the invention shall be<br>
adapted to its use. For example, it can be used in the form of a solution, suspension, tablet or<br>
others. The compositions for parenteral administration are generally pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable sterile solutions or suspensions which can optionally be prepared immediately<br>
before use.<br>
For the preparation of nonaqueous solutions or suspensions, it is possible to use natural<br>
vegetable oils like olive oil, sesame oil or paraffin oil or the injectable organic esters such as<br>
ethyl oleate. The sterile aqueous solutions can be composed of a solution of therapeutically<br>
4<br><br>
active substances in water. The aqueous solutions are suitable for intravenous administration in<br>
so far as the pH is properly adjusted and they are made isotonic, for example by adding a<br>
sufficient amount of sodium chloride or glucose.<br>
In fact, considering the chemical structure of antifungal agents, and secondly,<br>
considering the chemical structure of carveol, carvacrol, thymol, eugenol, borneol, alpha-ionone<br>
and beta-ionone, it is thought, without intending to be bound by this theory, that carveol,<br>
carvacrol, thymol, eugenol, borneol, alpha-ionone and beta-ionone and the isomers, derivatives<br>
and mixtures thereof, interact with the antifungal agents to form complexes having a structure<br>
which diffuses more easily into the body's physiological fluids and which diffuses more easily<br>
into the cytoplasm of target infected cells.<br>
However, it has been shown that when the different components of the pharmaceutical<br>
composition of the invention are mixed in the presence of detergents such as Tween or Triton<br>
or solvents such as ethanol or DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide), the active molecules of the first and<br>
second therapeutically active substance associate with the molecules of the detergents and<br>
solvents and do not form potentiating complexes.<br>
Now it has been discovered that the potentiating complex forms when an aqueous agar<br>
suspension is used, as means of dispersion by viscosity.<br>
Thus, the pharmaceutical composition of the invention will preferably be prepared<br>
without detergent and without solvent. For example, it will be prepared as an aqueous<br>
suspension made viscous by the addition of agar at a non-solidifying concentration, for example<br>
from 1 to 5 grams of agar per liter of suspension.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition of the invention enables the treatment of local or<br>
systemic infections caused by resistant microorganisms using doses of each of said first and<br>
second therapeutically active substance which are lower than the doses required for treating<br>
the same infections due to susceptible microorganisms with one or the other of these same<br>
said first and second therapeutically active substances alone. In fact, the composition of the<br>
invention enables the use of doses of said first therapeutically active substance, when it is<br>
combined with said second therapeutically active substance, which are approximately three to<br>
ten times lower than the doses required when said first therapeutically active substance is used<br>
alone, and of doses of said second therapeutically active substance, when it is combined with<br>
said first therapeutically active substance, which are approximately two to ten times lower than<br>
the doses required when said second therapeutically active substance is used alone.<br>
The result is to offer a treatment which has the following advantages:<br>
- effective at very low doses against susceptible microorganisms,<br>
- effective against microorganisms resistant to a therapeutic agent,<br>
- effective against microorganisms resistant to several therapeutic<br>
agents,<br>
5<br><br>
- control of recurrence phenomena,<br>
- control of phenomena of resistant microorganisms selection.<br>
In all these cases, there is a notable reduction in the risks of toxicity and/or adverse<br>
effects well known to the person of the art, thanks to the potentiation which enables the<br>
administration of very low doses.<br>
In addition, the costs of producing the treatment are reduced due to the use of small<br>
quantities of active substances.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention can be in the form of<br>
liposomes or associated with supports such as cyclodextrins or polyethylene glycols.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are a simple and efficient means to<br>
combat the problems related to microbial agents in general which comprise mainly resistance to<br>
therapeutic agents and toxicity of the latter resulting from the use of high doses.<br>
In fact, carveol, thymol, eugenol, borneol, carvacrol and the derivatives, mixtures and<br>
isomers thereof, are simple molecules which have never been described as having any toxicity<br>
whatsoever and their addition with its potentiating effect on the second therapeutically active<br>
substance enables the use of much lower doses of said second therapeutically active<br>
substance.<br>
In a first variant, then, the method for treating patients having a fungal infection consists<br>
in administering to said patients the dose, determined by the physician, of the pharmaceutical<br>
composition of the invention comprising suitable doses of at least one said first therapeutically<br>
active substance, combined with suitable doses of at least one said second therapeutically<br>
substance, that is, the suitable antifungal agent.<br>
In a second variant, the method for treating patients having a fungal infection consists in<br>
sequentially administering to said patients the dose determined by the physician of at least one<br>
said first therapeutically active substance, followed by the suitable dose of at least one said<br>
second therapeutically active substance, that is, the suitable antifungal agent, or vice versa.<br>
In this regard, the invention proposes a kit comprising at least one first container<br>
containing one of said first therapeutically active substances, and at least one second container<br>
containing one of said second therapeutically active substances.<br>
Said kit enables health care personnel to prepare on demand either a mixture of<br>
suitable doses of the desired first therapeutic substance(s) and of the desired antifungal<br>
agent(s) for a simultaneous administration, or to sequentially and separately administer the<br>
suitable dose of at least one said first therapeutically active substance, followed by the suitable<br>
dose of at least one said second therapeutically active substance, that is, the suitable antifungal<br>
agent, or vice versa. However, a mixture for simultaneous use shall be preferred in order to<br>
allow the potentiation complex to form and to act immediately after administration to the patient.<br>
The invention shall become clearer in the following examples describing different<br>
6<br><br>
embodiments, which are given for purposes of illustration and not by way of limitation.<br>
EXAMPLE 1: Treatment of different Candida albicans strains with fluconazole<br>
potentiated by carvacrol (Flue P)<br>
In vitro tests: Determination of Minimal Fungicidal Concentration (MFC) on different<br>
strains of Candida albicans<br>
The experiment was carried out with several strains of Candida albicans having<br>
different susceptibilities isolated in the hospital environment from the mouth, vagina and<br>
digestive tract. The antifungal agent used was fluconazole, an azole derivative which is one of<br>
the most effective and most widely used antifungals on the market. An antifungal<br>
pharmaceutical composition was prepared by mixing fluconazole at different concentrations<br>
with carvacrol at a sub-inhibitory concentration of 0.3 g per liter of solution or excipient. This<br>
pharmaceutical composition according to the invention was named FLUC-P for potentiated<br>
fluconazole. In each case, antifungal activity was determined either with fluconazole alone, or<br>
with carvacrol alone, or with the composition of the invention.<br>
Table 1 gives the results of static tests to determine the minimal fungicidal<br>
concentration (MFC) in µg/ml.<br>
Table 1<br><br>
Candida albicans in<br>
exponential growth<br>
phase	Fluconazole alone	Composition of the<br>
invention	Carvacrol alone<br>
	MFC (µg/ml)	MFC (µg/ml)	MFC (µg/ml)<br>
Susceptible strain	0.5	/	1000<br>
Moderately resistant<br>
strain	150	10	1000<br>
Highly resistant strain	&gt;300	10	1000<br>
Table 1 shows that the composition of the invention had notable fungicidal activity<br>
on these strains with different susceptibilities, as compared with fluconazole alone or with<br>
carvacrol alone.<br>
Indeed, from Table 1, it is noted that the composition of the invention has a<br>
remarkable fungicidal activity on those strains with different susceptibilities as compared with<br>
fluconazole alone or with carvacrol alone.<br>
In fact, it can be seen that by using a carvacrol concentration of 0.3 mg/ml, which is<br>
approximately three times lower than the MFC of carvacrol alone, the fluconazole concentration<br>
which produced fungicidal activity was 15 to 30 times lower than the MFC of fluconazole alone.<br>
7<br><br>
Kinetic tests<br>
Kinetic tests were also carried out on a C. albicans strain highly resistant in order to<br>
compare the fungicidal activities of fluconazole alone at a concentration of 300 µg/ml, carvacrol<br>
alone at 300 µg/ml and the composition of the invention comprising fluconazole 150 ug/ml and<br>
carvacrol 300 µg/ml. The number of colony-forming units (CFU) was measured over time.<br>
The results, shown in Figure 1, clearly indicate that only the composition of the<br>
invention had demonstrable activity against this highly resistant strain.<br>
In vivo tests<br>
Groups of 15 mice were experimentally infected by intravenous injection of<br>
10,000,000 cells (colony-forming units) of a Candida albicans strain with moderate resistance to<br>
fluconazole.<br>
The first group was composed of control mice which were infected and untreated.<br>
The second group was composed of infected mice treated by gavage, 24 h post-<br>
infection, with fluconazole alone at a dose of 4 mg/kg of body weight/day.<br>
The third group was composed of infected mice treated by gavage, 24 h post-<br>
infection, with carvacrol alone at a dose of 30 mg/kg of body weight/day.<br>
The fourth group was composed of infected mice treated by gavage, 24 h post-<br>
infection, with fluconazole 2 mg/kg of body weight and with carvacrol 30 mg/kg of body weight.<br>
The duration of treatment was seven days for surviving animals. The survival rate<br>
was measured over time. The results are given in Figure 2, which shows that only the mice<br>
treated with the pharmaceutical composition were still alive ten days after infection. All the<br>
other mice died between the second and seventh day post-infection.<br>
Examination of the organs of mice which died during the experiment (untreated<br>
mice and those treated with fluconazole alone or carvacrol alone) revealed high loads of<br>
Candida albicans in kidney, lung and bone marrow.<br>
In contrast, in mice treated with the composition of the invention and sacrificed one<br>
to ten days after stopping treatment, no C. albicans was found in lung and bone marrow.<br>
In kidney, only two animals still had a very low C. albicans load corresponding to 5%<br>
of that seen in the control group. The other animals treated with the composition of the<br>
invention had no fungal load in the kidneys.<br>
Here again, it clearly appears that potentiation of fluconazole by carvacrol gives<br>
surprising results regarding the reduction in the minimal fungicidal concentration and the<br>
rapidity of action in vitro.<br>
This potentiation was also found in vivo in a model of systemic infection.<br>
8<br><br>
Now, systemic infection is one of the most serious and life-threatening forms of<br>
infection and the most difficult to treat, especially in case of relapse with increasingly resistant<br>
microbes.<br>
Other data showed that the composition of the invention comprising fluconazole and<br>
carvacrol produced surprising therapeutic effects at doses which were at least two-fold lower<br>
than the doses required to treat localized experimental infections (vaginal and oral) in rats and<br>
mice.<br>
EXAMPLE 2: Treatment of different Candida albicans strains with<br>
voriconazole potentiated by carvacrol (Vorico-P)<br>
The experiment was carried out with several strains of Candida albicans having<br>
different susceptibilities isolated in the hospital environment. The antifungal agent used was<br>
voriconazole, an azole derivative and one of the most recent antifungals on the market. An<br>
antifungal pharmaceutical composition according to the invention was prepared by mixing<br>
voriconazole at different concentrations with carvacrol at a sub-inhibitory concentration of 0.3 g<br>
per liter of solution or excipient. This pharmaceutical composition according to the invention<br>
was named Vorico-P for potentiated voriconazole. In each case, antifungal activity was<br>
determined either with voriconazole alone, or with carvacrol alone, or with the composition of<br>
the invention.<br>
Table 2 gives the results of static tests to determine the minimal inhibitory<br>
concentration (MIC) and the minimal fungicidal concentration (MFC) in µg/ml.<br>
Table 2<br><br>
Candida albicans in<br>
exponential growth<br>
phase	Voriconazole alone	Vorico-P	Carvacrol alone<br>
	MIC (µg/ml)	MFC (µg/ml)	MFC (µg/ml)<br>
Susceptible strain	
Resistant strain	10	
Table 2 shows that the composition of the invention had notable fungicidal activity<br>
on the voriconazole-resistant strain, as compared with voriconazole alone or with carvacrol<br>
alone.<br>
In fact, it can be seen in Table 2 that by using a carvacrol concentration of 0.3<br>
mg/ml, which is 3.3 times lower than the MFC of carvacrol alone, the voriconazole<br>
concentration producing fungicidal activity against resistant strains was at least ten times lower<br>
than the concentration of voriconazole alone capable of exhibiting fungistatic activity.<br>
Thus, it can be seen that the potentiation of voriconazole by carvacrol not only<br>
9<br><br>
allowed a large reduction in the voriconazole dose but also transformed its fungistatic activity<br>
into a fungicidal action.<br>
EXAMPLE 3: Treatment of different Candida albicans strains with<br>
capsofungin potentiated by carvacrol (Caspo-P)<br>
The experiment was carried out with several strains of Candida albicans having<br>
different susceptibilities isolated in the hospital environment. The antifungal agent used was<br>
caspofungin, from the echinocandin family, which is one of the newest antifungals on the<br>
market. An antifungal pharmaceutical composition according to the invention was prepared by<br>
mixing caspofungin at different concentrations with carvacrol at a sub-inhibitory concentration of<br>
0.3 g per liter of solution or excipient. This pharmaceutical composition according to the<br>
invention was named Caspo-P for potentiated caspofungin. In each case, antifungal activity<br>
was determined either with caspofungin alone, or with carvacrol alone, or with the composition<br>
of the invention.<br>
Table 3 gives the results of static tests to determine the minimal inhibitory<br>
concentration (MIC) and the minimal fungicidal concentration (MFC) in µg/ml.<br>
Table 3<br><br>
Candida albicans in<br>
exponential growth<br>
phase	Caspofungin alone	Caspo-P	Carvacrol alone<br>
	MIC (µg/ml)	MFC (µg/ml)	MFC (µg/ml)<br>
Susceptible strain	
Resistant strain	3	
Table 3 shows that the composition of the invention had notable fungicidal activity<br>
on the resistant strain, as compared with caspofungin alone or with carvacrol alone.<br>
In fact, it can be seen in Table 3 that by using a carvacrol concentration of 0.3<br>
mg/ml, which is 3.3 times lower than the MFC of carvacrol alone, the caspofungin concentration<br>
producing fungicidal activity was at least six times lower than the concentration of caspofungin<br>
alone capable of exhibiting fungistatic activity.<br>
Thus, it can be seen that the potentiation of caspofungin by carvacrol not only<br>
allowed a large reduction in the caspofungin dose but also transformed its fungistatic activity<br>
into a fungicidal action.<br>
EXAMPLE 4: Treatment of different Candida albicans strains with 5-<br>

fluorocytosine potentiated by eugenol (Fluoro-P)<br>
The experiment was carried out with several strains of Candida albicans having<br>
different susceptibilities isolated in the hospital environment. The antifungal agent used was 5-<br>
fluorocytosine, from the pyrimidine group, which is one of the oldest antifungal agents. An<br>
antifungal pharmaceutical composition according to the invention was prepared by mixing 5-<br>
fluorocytosine at different concentrations with eugenol at a sub-inhibitory concentration of 0.5 g<br>
per liter of solution or excipient. This pharmaceutical composition according to the invention<br>
was named Fluoro-P for potentiated 5-fluorocytosine. In each case, antifungal activity was<br>
determined either with 5-fluorocytosine alone, or with eugenol alone, or with the composition of<br>
the invention.<br>
Table 4 gives the results of static tests to determine the minimal inhibitory<br>
concentration (MIC) and the minimal fungicidal concentration (MFC) in µg/ml.<br>
Table 4<br><br>
Candida albicans in<br>
exponential growth<br>
phase	5-fluorocytosine alone	Fluoro-P	Eugenol alone<br>
	MIC (µg/ml)	MFC (µg/ml)	MFC (µg/ml)<br>
Susceptible strain	2.5	/	2000<br>
Resistant strain	25	5	2000<br>
Table 4 shows that the composition of the invention had notable fungicidal activity<br>
on the resistant strain, as compared with 5-fluorocytosine alone or with eugenol alone.<br>
In fact, it can be seen in Table 4 that by using a eugenol concentration of 0.5 mg/ml,<br>
which is four times lower than the MFC of eugenol alone, the 5-fluorocytosine concentration<br>
producing fungicidal activity on resistant strains was five times lower than the concentration of<br>
5-fluorocytosine alone capable of exhibiting fungistatic activity.<br>
Thus, it can be seen that the potentiation of 5-fluorocytosine by eugenol not only<br>
allowed a large reduction in the 5-fluorocytosine dose but also transformed its fungistatic<br>
activity into a fungicidal action.<br>
EXAMPLE 5: Enlargement of the spectrum of action of fluconazole<br>
potentiated by carvacrol to different Aspergillus niger strains<br>
The experiment was carried out with several strains of Aspergillus niger which were<br>
not susceptible to fluconazole. The antifungal agent used was fluconazole, an azole derivative<br>
11<br><br>
and one of the most widely used antifungals. The biggest drawback of fluconazole is that it<br>
does not act on infections due to filamentous fungi. Aspergillosis, caused by microorganisms<br>
from the family Aspergillus sp, represents the most common and most difficult-to-treat infection.<br>
An antifungal pharmaceutical composition according to the invention was prepared by mixing<br>
fluconazole at different concentrations with carvacrol at a sub-inhibitory concentration of 0.25 g<br>
per liter of solution or excipient. This pharmaceutical composition according to the invention<br>
was named Fluc-P for potentiated fluconazole. In each case, antifungal activity was<br>
determined either with fluconazole alone, or with carvacrol alone, or with the composition of the<br>
invention.<br>
Table 5 gives the results of static tests to determine the minimal inhibitory<br>
concentration (MIC) and the minimal fungicidal concentration (MFC) in µg/ml.<br>
Table 5<br><br>
Candida albicans in<br>
exponential growth<br>
phase	Fluconazole alone	Fluc-P	Carvacrol alone<br>
	MIC (µg/ml)	MFC (µg/ml)	MFC (µg/ml)<br>
12 different strains of<br>
Aspergillus niger	&gt;1000	150	500<br>
Table 5 shows that the composition of the invention had notable fungicidal activity<br>
on Aspergillus niger, as compared with fluconazole alone or with carvacrol alone.<br>
In fact, it can be seen in Table 5 that the use of a carvacrol concentration of 0.25<br>
mg/ml, which is two times lower than the MFC of carvacrol alone, combined with fluconazole at<br>
a concentration of 150 µg/ml, led to an outstanding fungicidal activity that fluconazole alone<br>
was unable to provide even at a concentration of 1000 µg/ml.<br>
Thus, it can be seen that the potentiation of fluconazole by carvacrol not only<br>
allowed a large reduction in the fluconazole dose with species normally treated with<br>
fluconazole, but also enlarged the spectrum thereof to filamentous fungi from the Aspergillus<br>
genus which are normally not susceptible to fluconazole.<br>
The method for treating a fungal infection consists in administering simultaneously<br>
or sequentially to a patient having a fungal infection, the dose determined by the physician of at<br>
least one first therapeutically active substance selected from the group consisting of carveol,<br>
thymol, eugenol, borneol, carvacrol, and the isomers and derivatives and mixtures thereof, and<br>
the determined dose of at least one second therapeutically active substance which is an<br>
antifungal agent.<br>
Generally, one simultaneously or sequentially administers to a patient having a<br>
fungal infection between 1 and 3000 mg/kg of body weight/day of at least one first<br>
12<br><br>
therapeutically active substance selected from the group consisting of carveol, thymol, eugenol,<br>
borneol, carvacrol, alpha-ionone, beta-ionone and the isomers and derivatives and mixtures<br>
thereof, and between 1 and 20 mg/kg of body weight/day of at least one second therapeutically<br>
active substance which is an antifungal agent.<br>
In fact, the use of an amount less than 1 mg/kg of body weight/day of said first<br>
therapeutically active substance, in particular carvacrol, does not produce the desired<br>
potentiation effect.<br>
On the other hand, the use of an amount greater than 3000 mg/kg of body<br>
weight/day of said first therapeutically active substance, in particular carvacrol, does not further<br>
increase the potentiation effect and poses a greater risk of toxicity.<br>
Likewise, the use of an amount less than 1 mg/kg of body weight/day of said<br>
second therapeutically active substance which is an antifungal agent, in particular fluconazole,<br>
does not produce the desired therapeutic effect and the use of an amount greater than 20<br>
mg/kg of body weight/day, in particular of fluconazole, does not improve the therapeutic effect<br>
and increases the risk of toxicity.<br>
Thus, in a preferred manner, one simultaneously or sequentially administers to a<br>
patient having a fungal infection 30 mg/kg of body weight/day of at least one first therapeutically<br>
active substance selected from the group consisting of carveol, thymol, eugenol, borneol,<br>
carvacrol, alpha-ionone, beta-ionone and the isomers and derivatives and mixtures thereof, and<br>
2 mg/kg of body weight/day of at least one second therapeutically active substance which is an<br>
antifungal agent.<br>
More particularly, in the case of Candida albicans infection, one simultaneously or<br>
sequentially administers to the patient:<br>
- 30 mg/kg of body weight/day of carvacrol, and<br>
- 2 mg/kg of body weight/day of fluconazole.<br>
