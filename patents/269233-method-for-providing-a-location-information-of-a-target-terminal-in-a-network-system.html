Description<br>
METHOD FOR PROVIDING A LOCATION INFORMATION<br>
SERVICE IN MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM<br>
Technical Field<br>
[1]	The present invention relates to a location information service based upon a<br>
location (position) of a user in a wireless mobile communications system, and more<br>
particularly, to a method for providing a location information service using user<br>
privacy checking based upon the user location.<br>
Background Art<br>
[2]	In general, in order to provide a user with a location information service, a mobile<br>
communications network is provided with a unit that calculates a location of a<br>
terminal, thereby providing a location service for transmitting the location of the<br>
terminal to a particular entity periodically or upon the user request.<br>
[3]	Such network structure related to the location service is usually different from<br>
internal networks such as 3GPP, 3GPP2 or Open Mobile Alliance (OMA), and there<br>
are several methods for calculating the location of the terminal such as a method of<br>
using a cell-ID technique that transmitting a cell ID of the location of the terminal, a<br>
method for calculating the location of the terminal using triangular survey after<br>
measuring a time taken by transmitting a signal from the terminal to each base station<br>
adjacent thereto, or a method using a Global Positioning System (GPS), and the like.<br>
[4]	The location information service may also include a method for protecting privacy<br>
related to location information from a particular client.<br>
[5]	Fig. 1 is a signal flow diagram illustrating a typical method for protecting privacy,<br>
in which a privacy checking protocol (PCP) is used.<br>
[6]	A particular application 10 transmits a location information request message to a<br>
location server 20 in order to obtain location information for a particular user (S11).<br>
The location server 20 transmits a privacy request message to a Privacy Checking<br>
Entity (PCE) 30 in order to check the privacy related to the user's location information<br>
(S13).<br>
[7]	The PCE 30 having received the privacy request message from the location server<br>
20, checks privacy information associated with the user location information and<br>
checks information regarding an operation of the location server 20 (S15). Then, the<br>
PCE 30 transmits the operation information of the location server 20 associated with<br>
the privacy to the location server 20 using a privacy response message (S17), the<br>
location server 20 having received the privacy response message from the PCE 30<br>
transmits the user location information to the application 10 in the form of a location<br><br>
2<br>
WO 2006/118373	PCT/KR2006/000723<br>
information response message (S19).<br>
[8]	Privacy profiles defined in the related art PPR may roughly be divided into five.<br>
[9]	1) Positioning is not allowed.<br>
[10]	2) Positioning is allowed without notifying the user.<br>
[11]	3) Positioning is allowed with a notification to the user.<br>
[12]	4) Positioning requires a notification and verification by the user; positioning is<br>
allowed only if it is granted by the user or if there is no response to the notification;<br>
[13]	5) Positioning requires a notification and verification by the user; positioning is<br>
allowed only if it is granted by the user.<br>
[14]	However, the related art location information system does not provide various<br>
privacy authentication (management) services based upon the user location and set<br>
conditions. In particular, there is no related art location information system that has a<br>
feature of privacy profile considering the user location information. In other words, the<br>
related art location information system has not provided any method for performing the<br>
user authorization and verification based upon the location of a target user.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Problem<br>
[15]	One aspect of the present invention involves the recognition by the present<br>
inventors of the drawbacks in the related art, as explained above. Based upon such<br>
recognition, improvements in providing a location information service using user<br>
privacy checking based upon the user location can be achieved according to the present<br>
invention.<br>
[16]	Certain features that may be part of the location information service method and<br>
system will not be described in much detail, merely to prevent the characteristics of the<br>
present invention from being obscured. However, such additional features may also be<br>
part of the location information service method and system of the present invention, as<br>
would be understood by those skilled in the art.<br>
[17]	It is an object of the present invention to provide a method for providing a location<br>
information service based upon a user location in which a user sets privacy with<br>
respect to various locations or areas and the privacy is applied according to the current<br>
user location thereby having a different privacy in different locations.<br>
[18]	It is another object of the present invention to provide a method for providing a<br>
location information service based upon a user location in which privacy can be more<br>
secured based upon a current user location by allowing the user to determine whether<br>
or not to report a location information within preferred areas set by the user by<br>
performing a post positioning notification and verification process.<br>

agent in SUPL network) comprising: checking whether a user is currently located in a<br>
preferred location or a preferred area set by the user; checking privacy information<br>
with respect to the location information within the corresponding preferred location or<br>
preferred area when the user is currently located within the preferred location or the<br>
preferred area; and determining whether to report the user's location information to the<br>
LRE according to the privacy information.<br>

(Gateway Mobile Location Center) in 3GPP, SLP (SUPL) Location Platform) in SUPL<br>
network, etc.) which has received a location information request message for the user<br>
from the LRE; checking whether the user is currently located within the set preferred<br>
location or preferred area; checking privacy according to a location information within<br>
the corresponding preferred location or preferred area; requesting to perform a notification <br>
process for notifying a transmission of the location information to the user<br>
upon checking the privacy; and receiving a response with respect to the request and<br>
thus determining whether to report the user's location information according to the<br>
received response.<br>

comprise: checking privacy with respect to the positioning for the user by the H-<br>
GMLC having received a location information request; checking by the H-GMLC<br>
address information of the V-GMLC; obtaining, by the V-GMLC, the location information <br>
through the user positioning procedure and transmitting the location information <br>
to the H-GMLC; checking privacy with respect to the location information<br>
based upon the user current location information by the H-GMLC; if the user is<br>
required to check for the location information, transmitting a notification request<br>
message from the H-GMLC to the V-GMLC; performing a procedure for notifying the<br>
location information between the V-GMLC and the user; receiving a verification<br>
response message including the result of the notification and transmitting the received<br>

Mode for the Invention<br>
[28]	Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. It will also<br>
be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be<br>
made in the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the<br>
invention. Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover modifications and<br>
variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended<br>
claims and their equivalents.<br>
[29]		The present invention defines more privacy profiles based upon user location in<br>
formation and thus having a procedure of requesting a user authorization before<br>
reporting location information within a preferred location or preferred area set by the<br>
corresponding user.<br>
[30]	In general, in a user location information service to which the privacy profiles are<br>
added, a network service provider should always obtain location information, and the<br>
user can always change the privacy profile by setting such Privacy Profile Register<br>
(PPR), Privacy Exception List (PEL), Privacy Checking Entity (PCE), and the like.<br>
Also, the default condition shall normally be to deny the positioning attempt. The<br>
default treatment, which is applicable in the absence of a response from the target user<br>
or user equipment (UE), shall be specified in the target UE Subscription Profile. Thus,<br>
for some location services the default treatment may be to accept the positioning<br>
request, whereas for other location services the default treatment may be to reject the<br>
positioning attempt.<br>
[31]	The home network shall have the capability of defining the default circumstances in<br>
which the target UE's location information is allowed to be provided as required by<br>
various administrations and/or network requirements.<br>
[32]	The privacy check shall be performed in the Home Environment of the target UE<br>
subscriber. This makes it possible for operators to ensure the privacy of their own<br>
subscribers, i.e. the privacy settings that are used for privacy checks are always up-<br>
to-date and as specified by the Home Environment of the target UE subscriber.<br>
[33]	It shall be possible for the privacy check to take into account Home Environment<br>
specific information such as time of day, subscriber location, and the like. It shall be<br>
possible to ensure that privacy checks are performed according to the latest information <br>
as available in the Home Environment.<br>
[34]	Also, the target UE Subscriber shall be able to restrict access to the Location Information <br>
(permanently or on a per-attempt-basis). The LCS Client access shall be<br><br>
6<br>
WO 2006/118373	PCT/KR2006/000723<br>
restricted unless otherwise stated in the Target UE Subscription Profile. Again, in the<br>
absence of specific permission to position the target UE, the target UE should not be<br>
positioned.<br>
[35]	Usually, specific local, national, and regional privacy regulations must be complied<br>
with a location information service which privacy profiles are added, and multiple<br>
layers of permissions may be required for the location information service. For<br>
example, specific privacy exceptions may exist for compliance with mandated location<br>
based service (such as for emergency services or lawful intercept) which are required<br>
by national or local regulatory requirements.<br>
[36]	Sometimes, the operator shall be able to determine the location of the target UE<br>
(e.g. for lawful interception or emergency call). For emergency services (where<br>
required by local regulatory requirements), target UE making an emergency call may<br>
be positioned regardless of the privacy profile value of the subscriber associated with<br>
the target UE (or ME) making the call.<br>
[37]	Preferably, the target UE user shall not be notified of any location attempt. Unless<br>
required by local regulatory requirements, or overridden by the target UE User, the<br>
target UE may be positioned only if allowed in the UE subscription profile.<br>
[38]	Also, for Public-Land-Mobile-Network (PLMN) operator services, the target UE<br>
subscriber may be able to restrict access to location information used to enhance or<br>
support particular types of service. The LCS client access shall be restricted unless<br>
stated otherwise in the target UE subscription profile. The target UE user shall not be<br>
notified of any authorized location attempt. And, for Lawful Interception Services<br>
(where required by local regulatory requirements), target UE may be positioned under<br>
all circumstances required by local regulatory requirements.<br>
[39]	Therefore, all location requests (LRs) shall be done with a privacy check except for<br>
the following: 1) LRs relating to lawful interception; 2) LRs related to emergency<br>
calls; 3) LRs from the serving network related to anonymous tracking for statistical<br>
and O&amp;M purposes; and 4) LRs from the home network as requested by the home<br>
network operator for its own internal purposes.<br>
[40]	The home network operator should not use the UE location information, which was<br>
obtained from the visited network without privacy checks, for value added services or<br>
to forward such location information to any third party.<br>
[41]	Here, as one example of the present invention, in addition to the five privacy<br>
profiles defined in the related art PPR based upon the 3GPP having mentioned above,<br>
eight more profiles (6~13) may be added to perform the user notification and verification <br>
according to the current user location. Here, the added eight profiles may be<br>
used in case of setting a different privacy respectively according to the user current<br>
location.<br><br>
7<br>
WO 2006/118373	PCT/KR2006/000723<br>
[42]	The thirteen privacy profiles defined in the PPR based upon the 3GPP as an<br>
example of the present invention will be described as follows.<br>
[43]	1) Positioning is not allowed.<br>
[44]	2) Positioning is allowed without notifying the user.<br>
[45]	3) Positioning is allowed with a notification to the user.<br>
[46]	4) Positioning requires a notification and verification by the user; positioning is<br>
allowed only if it is granted by the user or if there is no response to the notification;<br>
[47]	5) Positioning requires a notification and verification by the user; positioning is<br>
allowed only if it is granted by the user.<br>
[48]	6) Reporting of location information requires a notification and verification by the<br>
user based on current location; positioning is performed without notifying the user and<br>
the reporting of the location information is performed when it is granted by the user or<br>
any response with respect to the notification is not received.<br>
[49]	7) Reporting of location information requires a notification and verification by the<br>
user based on current location; positioning is performed without notifying the user and<br>
the reporting of the location information is performed only if it is granted by the user.<br>
[50]	8) Reporting of location information requires a notification and verification by the<br>
user based on current location; positioning is performed after notifying the user and the<br>
reporting of the location information is performed when it is granted by the user or any<br>
response with respect to the notification is not received.<br>
[51]	9) Reporting of location information requires a notification and verification by the<br>
user based on current location; positioning is performed after notifying the user and the<br>
reporting of the location information is performed only if it is granted by the user.<br>
[52]	10) Reporting of location information requires a notification and verification by the<br>
user based on current location; positioning is performed after carrying out the no<br>
tification and verification process by the user. The positioning is even performed in<br>
case that it is authorized by the user or any response with respect to the notification is<br>
not received. Also, the reporting of the location information is performed only if it is<br>
granted by the user.<br>
[53]	11) Reporting of location information requires a notification and verification by the<br>
user based on current location; positioning is performed after carrying out the no<br>
tification and verification process by the user. The positioning is even performed in<br>
case that it is authorized by the user or any response with respect to the notification is<br>
not received. Also, the reporting of the location information, like the positioning, is<br>
performed even when it is granted by the user or any response with respect to the no<br>
tification is not received.<br>
[54]	12) Reporting of location information requires a notification and verification by the<br>
user based on current location; positioning is performed after carrying out the no-<br><br>
8<br>
WO 2006/118373	PCT/KR2006/000723<br>
tification and verification process by the user only when it is granted by the user. Also,<br>
the reporting of the location information is performed even when it is granted by the<br>
user or any response with respect to the notification is not received.<br>
[55]	13) Reporting of location information requires a notification and verification by the<br>
user based on current location; positioning is performed after carrying out the no<br>
tification and verification process by the user only when it is granted by the user. Also,<br>
the reporting of the location information is performed even when it is granted by the<br>
user.<br>
[56]	Here, the privacy profiles of the present invention correspond to 6) to 13). In order<br>
to request a user authorization before reporting location information within the<br>
preferred location or preferred area preset by the user, an additional process is needed<br>
to be provided for requesting the user authorization based upon a location value<br>
calculated after performing the positioning for the corresponding user. A brief ex<br>
planation will now be given for the method for providing the location information<br>
service according to the present invention.<br>
[57]	First, a particular user uses one of the privacy profile values associated with its<br>
location information to set whether to transmit its location information from one or<br>
more locations or areas to a third user or other network entity. Here, the location or<br>
area in which the user has set the privacy profile associated with its location in<br>
formation is set as one user preferred area. That is, while moving, the user can set one<br>
or more user preferred areas and a privacy profile for each preferred area.<br>
[58]		The privacy profiles within the preferred areas having set by the user, namely, in<br>
formation with respect to whether to transmit the user's location information and<br>
whether to request the performing of the process for the user authorization can be<br>
stored in the PPR or a separate storage unit.<br>
[59]	When the third user or the network entity requests the user's location information,<br>
the specific user connects to the PPR to check the privacy profile associated with the<br>
location information set by the user.<br>
[60]	If the privacy profile relates to requesting a notification and verification based upon<br>
the current user position, the specific user checks information of whether to transmit<br>
the user's location information and whether to request the performing of a process for<br>
the user authorization. The specific user then determines whether to transmit the cor<br>
responding user's location information. Subsequent procedures for the location in<br>
formation request from the third user or another network entity can be then performed.<br>
[61]	Fig. 2 is a signal flowchart showing an embodiment of a method for providing a<br>
location information service according to the present invention, which describe a<br>
Mobile Terminating Location Request (MT-LR) procedure in a packet service (PS)<br>
domain and a circuit service (CS) domain.<br><br>

(e.g., target UE) of which location information is requested.<br>
[63]	The GMLC may include a Requesting-GMLC (referred to as R-GMLC, hereafter)<br>
43 of a network which requests the location information, a Home-GMLC (referred to<br>
as H-GMLC, hereafter) 45 which is a GMLC of a user's home network, and a Visited-<br>
GMLC (referred to as V-GMLC) 49 which is a GMLC to which the user has moved<br>
when the user has moved to the third network.<br>
[64]	In the present invention, it is assumed that a target user 55 from which the LCS<br>
client 41 requests the location information moves to the third network. The target user<br>
55 can be referred to as just a user hereafter.<br>
[65]	An external location service client (just referred to as a LCS client hereafter) 41<br>
transmits a LOCATION INFORMATION REQUEST message (e.g., LCS Service<br>
Request) to the R-GMLC 43 to request location information related to a particular<br>
target user 55 (S21).<br>
[66]	The R-GMLC 43 having received the LOCATION INFORMATION REQUEST<br>
message checks an ID of the LCS client 41 and verifies whether it is an available<br>
client. The R-GMLC 43 then checks whether the user privacy profile is stored therein.<br>
Here, if the privacy profile is stored in the R-GMLC 43, the R-GMLC 43 is the H-<br>
GMLC 45 of the user 55 and thus it is possible to skip a series of processes (S22 and<br>
S23) for obtaining the address of the H-GMLC 45 and processes (S24 and S37) for<br>
exchanging messages between the R-GMLC 43 and the H-GMLC 45. If the R-GMLC<br>
43 already knows the address of the H-GMLC 45, such processes (S22 and S23) for<br>
obtaining the address of the H-GMLC 45 can be skipped.<br>
[67]	If the R-GMLC 43 is not the H-GMLC 45 and does not know the address of the H-<br>
GMLC 45, the R-GMLC 43 transmits a ROUTING INFORMATION REQUEST<br>
message (e.g., Send Routing Info For LCS) to the HLR/HSS 47 of the user's home<br>
network to request the address of the H-GMLC 45 (S22). The HLR/HSS 47 checks<br>
whether the R-GMLC 43 is authorized to request the location information related to<br>
the user 55. Thereafter, the HLR/HSS 47 transmits the address of the H-GMLC 45 to<br>
the R-GMLC 43 using a ROUTING INFORMATION REQUEST RESULT message<br>
(e.g., Send Routing Info For LCS ack) (S23).<br>
[68]	The R-GMLC 43 having received the ROUTING INFORMATION REQUEST<br>
RESULT message transmits a LOCATION INFORMATION REQUEST message<br>
(e.g., LCS Service Request) related to the user 55 to the H-GMLC 45 (S24), which<br>
then accesses the PPR (not shown in Figure) to check privacy settings associated to the<br><br>
10<br>
WO 2006/118373	PCT/KR2006/000723<br>
location information for the user 55 (S25). Here, while checking the privacy settings,<br>
the H-GMLC 45 checks possibility of positioning.<br>
[69]	If it is possible to perform the positioning for the user 55, the H-GMLC 45<br>
transmits the ROUTING INFORMATION REQUEST message (e.g., Send Routing<br>
Info For LCS) to the HLR/HSS 47 in order to check addresses of the V-GMLC 49 and<br>
the SGSN and/or VMSC/MSC 51 (S26), and receives the addresses of the SGSN and/<br>
or VMSC/MSC 51 and the V-GMLC 49 from the HLR/HSS 47 related to the user 55<br>
using a ROUTING INFORMATION REQUEST RESULT message (e.g., Send<br>
Routing Info For LCS ack) (S27).<br>
[70]	The H-GMLC 45 transmits the LOCATION INFORMATION REQUEST message<br>
(e.g., the LCS Service Request) to the corresponding V-GMLC 49 by checking the<br>
address thereof included in the ROUTING INFORMATION REQUEST RESULT<br>
message (S28). The V-GMLC 49 having received the LOCATION INFORMATION<br>
REQUEST message performs an MT-LR procedure with the user 55 for the positioning <br>
with respect to the user 55 (S29). The MT-LR procedure will be explained in<br>
detail later.<br>
[71]	The V-GMLC 49 transmits location information related to the user 55 which has<br>
been calculated by performing the MT-LR procedure to the H-GMLC 45 using a<br>
LOCATION INFORMATION RESPONSE message (e.g., LCS Service Response)<br>
(S30). The H-GMLC 45 having received the LOCATION INFORMATION<br>
RESPONSE message checks the privacy settings of the current user 55 in order to<br>
determine whether the location information related to the corresponding user 55<br>
corresponds to the preferred area set in the privacy (S31).<br>
[72]	During the processes (S25 and S31) for checking the privacy setting, if the privacy<br>
profile is checked to have been added in the present invention, namely, if the privacy<br>
profile is to request the notification and verification based upon the current user<br>
position, the H-GMLC 45 performs a series of processes (S32 through S36) to verify<br>
whether to report the location information related to the user 55 to the LCS client 51.<br>
[73]	If the privacy profile for the user 55 is to request the notification and verification<br>
within a particular location or area and the current user location or area is the preferred<br>
area for which the notification and verification should be performed, the H-GMLC 45<br>
transmits the ROUTING INFORMATION REQUEST message (e.g., Send Routing<br>
Info For LCS) to the HLR/HSS 47 to request the addresses of the V-GMLC 49 and the<br>
SGSN and/or VMSC/MSC 51 (S32), and receives the information of the addresses<br>
thereof from the HLR/HSS 47 through the ROUTING INFORMATION REQUEST<br>
RESULT message (e.g., Send Routing Info For LCS ack) (S33). Here, the processes<br>
(S32 and S33) for checking the addresses of the SGSN and/or VMSC/MSC 51 and the<br>
V-GMLC 49 are optionally performed in case that the H-GMLC 45 already knows the<br><br>
11<br>
WO 2006/118373	PCT/KR2006/000723<br>
address information.<br>
[74]	The H-GMLC 45 transmits a NOTIFICATION REQUEST message for requesting<br>
the user notification and verification to the V-GMLC 49 of a network to which the user<br>
55 has moved (S34). The V-GMLC 49 having received the NOTIFICATION<br>
REQUEST message performs a notification process with the corresponding user 55 to<br>
check whether to report the location information (S35). Here, the notification process<br>
according to the present invention will be explained in detail with reference to the<br>
related drawings.<br>
[75]	The V-GMLC 49 checks whether to report the location information related to the<br>
user 55 to the LCS client 41 through the notification process, and transmits the result<br>
of the check to the H-GMLC 45 by including the result in a NOTIFICATION<br>
RESPONSE message (S36). Here, the result included in the responded message may<br>
be represented with an indication of attribute, parameter, element, value, and the like.<br>
When the V-GMLC 49 docs not receive the result of the verification from the user 55<br>
during the notification procedure, the V-GMLC 49 counts down a particular time<br>
duration using an internal timer, and thereafter transmits the NOTIFICATION<br>
RESPONSE message including the result of the unsuccessful reception of the notification <br>
result to the H-GMLC 45.<br>
[76]	The H-GMLC 45 transmits a LOCATION INFORMATION RESPONSE message<br>
including the location information related to the user 55 to the R-GMLC 43 according<br>
to the resultant value included in the NOTIFICATION RESPONSE message or<br>
consistency with the conditions for the transmission of the location information (S37).<br>
The R-GMLC 43 transmits the LOCATION INFORMATION RESPONSE message to<br>
the LCS client 41 (38). Here, if the NOTIFICATION RESPONSE message includes a<br>
value or indication of not-granted state for the reporting of the user location in<br>
formation or the preset conditions for the transmission of the location information are<br>
not complied with, the H-GMLC 45 notifies the LCS client 41 with showing a<br>
reporting of the location information is not granted.<br>
[77]	Figs. 3 and 4 are signal flowcharts respectively showing a detailed MT-LR<br>
procedure S29 shown in Fig. 2, which describes the MT-LR procedure which is im<br>
plemented differently according to whether a current user service network is a circuit<br>
service (CS) domain or a packet service (PS) domain after performing such processes<br>
corresponding to S21 through S28 shown in Fig. 2.<br>
[78]	Fig. 3 is a signal flowchart showing a MT-LR procedure in the CS domain. After<br>
performing the common processes corresponding to S21 through S28 of Fig. 2, the<br>
GMLC 49 transmits a PROVIDE SUBSCRIBER LOCATION message to the VMSC/<br>
MSC server 51 (S41). Here, the message may include types of the requested location<br>
information (e.g., a current location, speed information or the like), a user's IMSI<br><br>
12<br>
WO 2006/118373	PCT/KR2006/000723<br>
(International Mobile Subscriber Identity), LCS QoS (Location Service Quality of<br>
Service) information (e.g., accuracy, responding time, etc.) and the like.<br>
[79]	The VMSC/MSC server 51 calls the user 55 via a RAN 53 to perform an au<br>
thentication process therewith (S42). If a notification and authentication with respect to<br>
the corresponding user 55 is required in connection with the location information for<br>
the user 55, the VMSC/MSC server 51 transmits a LOCATION INFORMATION NO-<br>
TIFICATION message (e.g., LCS Location Notification) to the user 55 (S43). Here,<br>
whether the notification and verification is required can be checked by considering the<br>
privacy profiles in the privacy checking process of S31 in Fig. 2.<br>
[80]	If the user verification with respect to the LOCATION INFORMATION NO-<br>
TIFICATION message is required, the corresponding user 55 transmits a VER-<br>
IFICATION RESPONSE message (e.g., LCS Location Notification Return) to the<br>
VMSC/MSC server 51 (S44). The VMSC/MSC server 51 then transmits a<br>
LOCATION INFORMATION REQUEST message to the RAN 53 (S45).<br>
[81]	An actual positioning is performed between the RAN 53 and the user 55 (S46). The<br>
RAN 53 transmits the calculated location information to the VMSC/MSC server 51<br>
using a LOCATION INFORMATION RESPONSE message (S47). The VMSC/MSC<br>
server 51 transmits the calculated location information to the GMLC 49 using a<br>
PROVIDE SUBSCRIBER LOCATION RESPONSE message (S48).<br>
[82]	In this way, the common MT-LR procedure corresponding to S30, S37 and S38 in<br>
Fig. 2 is then performed.<br>
[83]	Fig. 4 is a signal flowchart showing a MT-LR procedure in the PS domain. After<br>
performing the common processes corresponding to S21 through S28 in Fig. 2, the<br>
GMLC 49 transmits the PROVIDE SUBSCRIBER LOCATION message to the SGSN<br>
51 (S51). Here, the message may include types of the requested location information<br>
(e.g., a current location, speed information or the like), a user's IMSI (International<br>
Mobile Subscriber Identity), LCS QoS (Location Service Quality of Service) information <br>
(e.g., accuracy, responding time, etc) and the like.<br>
[84]	The SGSN 51 calls the user 55 via the RAN 53 to perform an authentication process<br>
therewith (S52), and performs a security procedure therewith (S53).<br>
[85]	If a notification and verification with respect to the corresponding user 55 is<br>
required in connection with the user's location information, the SGSN 51 transmits the<br>
LOCATION INFORMATION NOTIFICATION message (e.g., LCS Location Notification) <br>
to the corresponding user 55 (S54), and receives, if necessary, the VERIFICATION RESPONSE <br>
message (e.g., LCS Location Notification Return) in<br>
response to the LOCATION INFORMATION NOTIFICATION message from the<br>
user 55 (S55). Here, whether the notification and verification is required can be<br>
checked based upon the privacy profiles in the privacy checking process of S31 in Fig.<br><br>
13<br>
WO 2006/118373	PCT/KR2006/000723<br>
2.<br>
[86]	The SGSN 51 transmits the LOCATION INFORMATION REQUEST message to<br>
the RAN 53 (S56). Positioning is thus performed by exchanging messages between the<br>
RAN 53 and the user 55 (S57). The RAN 53 transmits the calculated location in-<br>
formation to the SGSN 51 using the LOCATION INFORMATION RESPONSE<br>
message (S58). The SGSN 51 transmits the calculated location information to the<br>
GMLC 49 using a PROVIDE SUBSCRIBER LOCATION RESPONSE message<br>
(S59).<br>
[87]	Thereafter, the common MT-LR procedure corresponding to S30, S37 and S38 in<br>
Fig. 2 is then performed.<br>
[88]	The GMLC of Figs 3 and 4 indicates the V-GMLC 49 of Fig. 2, which is the<br>
GMLC of the network to which the user 55 of which location information has been<br>
requested by the LCS client 41 currently belongs.<br>
[89]	Figs. 5 and 6 arc signal respectively flowcharts showing the notification procedure<br>
S35 of Fig. 2 (i.e., the post positioning notification procedure for CS and PS domains)<br>
in detail. After performing the MT-LR procedure corresponding to S21 through S34 in<br>
Fig. 2, the notification procedure which may be implemented differently according to<br>
whether the current service network to which the user currently belongs is the CS<br>
domain or the PS domain will now be described.<br>
[90]	In the present invention, when the user's location information is transmitted to a<br>
third user or to another network entity within a specific preferred area, the user can set<br>
privacy such that the user can perform the notification and verification process for<br>
reporting of location information.<br>
[91]	When the user is currently located within a preferred area and the privacy profile set<br>
for the area requires the notification and verification process, the notification process is<br>
performed to check whether to transmit the user's location information.<br>
[92]	Fig. 5 is a signal flowchart showing the notification procedure in the CS domain.<br>
After performing the MT-LR procedure (i.e., the MT-LR procedures for CS and PS<br>
domains) corresponding to S21 through S34 in Fig. 2, the GMLC 49 transmits a NO-<br>
TIFICATION REQUEST MESSAGE (e.g., Provide Subscriber Location) to the<br>
VMSC/MSC server 51 (S61). Here, the GMLC 49 transfers a notification and ver-<br>
ification request of the transmission of location information to the VMSC/MSC server<br>
51 using the NOTIFICATION REQUEST message.<br>
[93]	The VMSC/MSC server 51 performs an authentication process by calling the user<br>
55 via the RAN 53 (S62), and then transmits to the user 55 a LOCATION IN-<br>
FORMATION NOTIFICATION message (e.g., LCS Location Notification) for<br>
notifying the user 55 of the notification and verification request related to the current<br>
user location information (S63).<br><br>
14<br>
WO 2006/118373	PCT/KR2006/000723<br>
[94]		If the user verification with respect to the LOCATION INFORMATION NO-<br>
TIFICATION message is required, the corresponding user 55 transmits to the VMSC/MSC <br>
server 51 a VERIFICATION RESPONSE message (e.g., LCS Location Notification <br>
Return) (S64). The VMSC/MSC server 51 transmits the result of the notification <br>
and verification related to the location information to the GMLC 49 using the<br>
NOTIFICATION RESPONSE message (S65) (e.g., Provide Subscriber Location ack).<br>
Here, the result included in the responded message may be represented with an<br>
indication of attribute, parameter, element, value, and the like.<br>
[95]	Thereafter, the location information related to the user 55 may be transmitted or not<br>
to the LCS client 41 depending on the NOTIFICATION RESPONSE message.<br>
[96]	Fig. 6 is a signal flowchart showing the notification procedure within the PS<br>
domain. After performing the MT-LR procedure corresponding to S21 through S34 in<br>
Fig. 2, the GMLC 49 transmits the NOTIFICATION REQUEST message (e.g.,<br>
Provide Subscriber Location) to the SGSN 51 (S71). Here, the GMLC 49 transfers a<br>
notification and verification request with respect to the transmission of location information <br>
to the SGSN 51.<br>
[97]	The SGSN 51 performs an authentication process by calling the user 55 via the<br>
RAN 53 (S72), and then performs a security process with the corresponding user 55<br>
(S73). The SGSN 51 then transmits to the user 55 the LOCATION INFORMATION<br>
NOTIFICATION message (e.g., LCS Location Notification Invoke) for notifying the<br>
user 55 of the notification and verification request related to the current user location<br>
information (S74).<br>
[98]	If the user verification with respect to the LOCATION INFORMATION NO-<br>
TIFICATION message is required, the corresponding user 55 transmits to the SGSN<br>
51 the VERIFICATION RESPONSE message (e.g., LCS Location Notification Return<br>
Result) (S75). The SGSN 51 transmits the result of the notification and verification<br>
related to the location information to the GMLC 49 using the NOTIFICATION<br>
RESPONSE message (e.g., Provide Subscriber Location ack) (S76). Here, the result<br>
included in the responded message may be represented with an indication of attribute,<br>
parameter, clement, value, and the like.<br>
[99]	Thereafter, the location information related to the user 55 may be transmitted or not<br>
to the LCS client 41 depending on the NOTIFICATION RESPONSE message.<br>
[100]	The GMLC of Figs 5 and 6 indicates the V-GMLC 49 of Fig. 2, which is the<br>
GMLC of the network to which the user 55 of which location information has been<br>
requested by the LCS client 41 currently belongs.<br>
[101]	The present invention can be characterized by comprising checking whether the<br>
user is currently located within the preferred location or preferred area set by the user,<br>
checking privacy with the transmission of the location information if the user is<br><br>
15<br>
WO 2006/118373	PCT/KR2006/000723<br>
currently located within the preferred location or preferred area, requesting the user to<br>
perform a process for notifying the transmission of the location information according<br>
the checked privacy, and receiving a message in response to the request to determine<br>
accordingly whether to transmit the user's location information.<br>
[102]	In addition, the present invention can also be characterized, in a system for<br>
transmitting location information with respect to a specific user using a network<br>
structure constituted with the SUPL agent, the SLP and the SET of the SUPL network,<br>
by comprising checking whether the user is currently located within the preferred<br>
location or preferred area set by the user, checking privacy information with respect to<br>
the transmission of the location information within the preferred location or preferred<br>
area if the user is currently located therein, and determining whether to transmit the<br>
user's location information to the LRE depending on the privacy information.<br>
[103]	Also, the various features of the present invention may be further described and<br>
explained in the following manner. Note that the clement reference numbers have not<br>
been specified, but may be clearly understood upon viewing the drawings and this<br>
overall disclosure.<br>
[ 104]	For example, it shall be possible for location services to support conditional<br>
reporting if the target UE is within specified geographical areas. Under these<br>
conditions, an application that is granted conditional positioning authorization must<br>
notify and obtain positioning authorization from the user of the target UE after the po-<br>
sitioning process is performed, but before reporting the location of the target UE to the<br>
LCS client. It may also be possible for a target UE to authorize positioning attempts<br>
after the target UE is notified of a positioning request and the target UE grants<br>
permission for positioning.<br>
[105]	To implement the various features described above, the present invention can<br>
employ various types of hardware and/or software components (modules). For<br>
example, different hardware modules may contain various circuits and components<br>
necessary to perform the steps of the above method. Also, different software modules<br>
(executed by processors and/or other hardware) may contain various codes and<br>
protocols necessary to perform the steps of the present invention method.<br>
[106]	The foregoing embodiments and advantages, which explained with figures, are<br>
merely exemplary and are not to be construed as limiting the present invention in one<br>
skilled in the ordinary art. Specifically, the features of the present invention may also<br>
be adapted and implemented in communication systems operating under other types of<br>
communication specifications (e.g., 3GPP, 3GPP2, 4G, IEEE, OMA(i.e., SUPL<br>
network), etc.) because the concepts and teachings of the present invention could be<br>
applied to various communication schemes that operate in a similar manner based upon<br>
common techniques.<br><br>

[40]	The method of claim 39, further comprising: after sending the location no-<br>
tification message from the SGSN to the target UE, the target UE transmits a<br>
location notification return result to SGSN indicating whether permission of<br>
privacy verification is granted or denied; and the SGSN further transmits an<br>
indication of notification and verification result to GMLC when the location no-<br>
tification return result indicates whether the permission is granted or denied.<br>
[41] 	A method of verifying a request of location information from an LCS client<br>
performed by a target User equipment (UE), the method comprising:<br>
receiving a notification message, wherein the notification message is transmitted<br>
from a network if a user notification and/or verification process is needed to be<br>
performed by checking a privacy profile information for a location of the target<br>
UE; and<br>
sending a notification message result with an indication of whether forwarding<br>
the location information of the target UE to the LCS client is granted or denied.<br><br>
In a method for providing a location information service based upon a user's location, when a user is currently<br>
located within a preferred location or preferred area set by the user to apply privacy with respect to a transmission of location information <br>
thereto, a procedure for requesting the user's authorization is performed before transmitting the user's location information,<br>
namely, a location server checks a location information request for the user located within the preferred location or preferred area<br>
according to a privacy profile within the corresponding location or area and performs a user notification and verification process<br>
according to the privacy profile, to thereafter determine whether to forward the location information according to the result of the<br>
verification.<br></td>
