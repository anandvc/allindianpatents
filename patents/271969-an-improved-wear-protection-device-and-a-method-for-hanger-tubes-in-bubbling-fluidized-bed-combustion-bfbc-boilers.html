TntE i ^IMPROVED MEHTOP OF STRAP SUPPORT IH HANGER TUBK<br>
OF BFBC BOILERS ADAPTABLE TO WEAR PROTECTIOW'.<br>
FIELPOFTHEINVEHTIQM<br>
The pre^nt invention relates to an improved method of strap support of haiger<br>
tubes in Bubbling fiuidized bed combustion boilers. (BFBC). More particularly, the<br>
pre^nt Invention relates to an Improved method of strap support In hanger<br>
tubes for wear protection in BFBC boilers.<br>
BACKQRQVNP Of THE INVENTIPH<br>
The BFBC ts an environment friendly and efficient system of burning various<br>
grades of fuels. The fuel bums between 700-900 deg C. This temperature<br>
ensures that Nox is not formed. Sortent In the form of limestone Is added to<br>
capture the sulphur in the fuel thereby preventing the formation of Sox. The<br>
principle heat ti'ansfer surges like evaporator and super heater are immersed in<br>
the fiuidized bed. The primary air of combustion is directed through the bed at a<br>
pre determined velocity, at which the bed behaves like fluid and effective heat<br>
transfer takes place due to fluidization.<br>
Hanger tubes constituting evaporator tubes are used for supporting Super heater<br>
colls inside the fijmace of the boiler. Typical arrangement is shown in Eg 1.<br>
Two horizontal straps are used to support the colls along with the vertical hanger<br>
tijbe. The arrangement is such that it supports the coils as well as allows for<br>
 <br>
-3-<br>
thermal expansions to be accommodated. It was observed in many boilers that<br>
the horizontal straps were continuously rubbing against the hanger tube and<br>
causing feilure of hanger tube due to wear.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore, an object of the present invention to propose an Improved<br>
method of strap support In hanger tubes for wear protection which protects the<br>
hanger tubes from rubbing due to thermal expansion of hori^ntal straps.<br>
An another object of the invention is to propose an Improved method of strap<br>
support in hanger tubes for wear protection which efficientiy protects the hanger<br>
tubes from rubbing due to thermal movements of straps and thereby enhances<br>
the life of tiie hanger tubes.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to propose an improved method of<br>
strap support in hanger tube for wear protection which efficientiy protects the<br>
hanger tubes ftom rubbing due to thermal movement of straps which enables<br>
optimized routing of the hanger tubes.<br>
A still further object of the present invention is to propose an improved method<br>
of strap support In hanger tube for wear protection which efficientiy protects the<br>
hanger tubes fiiom rubbing due to thermal movement of straps which makes the<br>
furnace further compact.<br>

SUMMARY OF THE IHVENTIOW<br>
Accordingly, there is provided an improved method of strap support In hanger<br>
tube for wear protection in Bf=BC boilers comprising a hot air distributor plate<br>
disposed at the bottom boundary of the combustor enclosed by a membrane,<br>
said plate having a plurality of air nozzles, a hot air source for continuous supply<br>
of hot air through said nozzles Into the fluidized bed, a first super heater coil<br>
immersed In the bed of the boiler; a second super heater coil above the bed<br>
supported by a plurality of hanger tubes; and a tube assembly comprising a<br>
tube, straps and vertical sleeves fitted over the tube.<br>
BRIEF PESCRIPTIOW OF THE ACCOMPAMYIHG DRAWIHGS<br>
Rgure 1 - shows a typical arrangement of hanger taibes in a BFBC boiler,<br>
Figure 2 - shows a cross sectional view of a strap support tube used in prior art.<br>
Rgure 3 - shows a vertical sleeve fitted on to a hanger tube.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMEBODIMENT OF THE<br>
With the above and other objectives in view, the present invention provides an<br>
alternative method of wear protection of hanger tube. The present invention<br>
 <br>
-5-<br>
nelafces to a Bfec boiter to overcome the above said drawbacks. It has been the<br>
endeavor of the applicant to develop alternate ways to avoid wears.<br>
The present invention provides an improved and cost effective device for wear<br>
ptx&gt;tect3on. Accordingly to present invention, vertical sleeve are designed to<br>
form a ring over a tube (11) so that they form a protective layer (Rg 3).<br>
The type of tube used has high wear resistant properties. Further it is tested with<br>
suitable erosion tests tÂ» determine the suitability for the intended woridng<br>
atmosphere. Having ensured so the sleeve material is selected.<br>
T^e sleeve is mounted on t^e hanger tube after providing suitable slots for<br>
projection of the support lugs. The strap arrangement is then assembled over it<br>
supporting the SH coils. The sleeve prevents direct rubbing of straps against the<br>
tube. Thus the wear of the hanger tube is prevented.<br>
A hot^ir distributor plate (1) is arranged fixedly on the boundary wall of the<br>
BFBC boiler by a membrane (2). The plate (1) is having a number of air-injecting<br>
nozzles (7). Hot air form a source is continuously passed to tjie fluidized bed (8)<br>
of the boiler via the nozzles (7). One each heater coil (3, 4) is placed inside the<br>
bed (8) and above the bed (8). The second heater coil (4) is supported by a<br>
plurality of hanger tubes (5). Instead of direct strap supports (9) as of the prior<br>
art, a vertical sleeve (6) Is mounted over a tube (11) to entirely cover the tube<br>
(11) portion where the straps rub against it thereby forming a assembly (10).<br>
The tube assembly (10) prevents the hanger tubes (5) from getting wear by the<br>
thermal movement of the straps thereby protecting the hanger tubes (5) from<br>
feilure. <br>
<br>
Accordingly, there is provided an improved method of strap support in hanger<br>
tube for wear protection in BFBC boilers comprising a hot air distributor plate<br>
disposed at the bottom boundary of the combustor enclosed by a membrane,<br>
said plate having a plurality of air nozzles, a hot air source for continuous supply<br>
of hot air through said nozzles into the fluidized bed, a first super heater coil<br>
immersed in the bed of the boiler; a second super heater coil above the bed<br>
supported by a plurality of hanger tubes; and a tube assembly comprising a<br>
tube, straps and vertical sleeves fitted over the tube.<br>
