				<td>The   invention   relates   to   a   refrigerant   composition   comprising   a hydrofluorocarbon    refrigerant    containing    pentafluoroethane      and      a lubricating oil for    compression-type   refrigerators   and   to   an   apparatus for refrigeration.    More    particularly, the   present invention relates   to  a lubricating    oil    for    compression-type    refrigerators    using    a hydrofluorocarbon  refrigerant  containing  pentafluoroethane  which lubricating  oil   comprises  a  polyvinyl   ether  compound,   shows  an excellent compatibility with hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants containing pentafluoroethane  which  can  replace  chlorofluorocarbons  causing environmental pollution, has a volume intrinsic resistance of 1012 Qcm or more at 80°C, and exhibits excellent stability and lubricating property.<br>
PRIOR ART OF THE INVENTION<br>
In general, compression-type refrigerators are constituted at least with a compressor, a condenser, an expansion mechanism (such as an expansion valve and a capillary tube), an evaporator, and a drier and has a structure in which a mixed fluid of a refrigerant and a lubricating oil is circulated in the closed system. Temperature is high in the compressor and low in the refrigerating chamber generally in the compression-type refrigerator though the conditions may be different depending on the type of machinery, and it is generally required that the refrigerant and the lubricating oil be circulated in the system without causing phase separation in the wide range of temperature. A mixture of a refrigerant and a lubricating oil generally has regions of phase<br><br>
separation at the low temperature side and at the high temperature side. The highest temperature in the region of phase separation at the low temperature side is preferably -10°C or lower, more preferably -20°C or lower. The lowest temperature in the region of phase separation at the high temperature side is preferably 30°C or higher, more preferably 40°C or higher. When phase separation occurs during the operation of the refrigerator, life and efficiency of the apparatus are adversely affected to a great extent. For example, when phase separation of the refrigerant and the lubricating oil occurs in the part of the compressor, lubrication of the moving parts is deteriorated, and seizure occurs to cause decrease in the life of the apparatus to a great extent. When the phase separation occurs in the evaporator, efficiency of heat exchange is decreased because of the presence of lubricating oil of high viscosity.<br>
Because the lubricating oil for refrigerators is used for the purpose of lubricating moving parts in refrigerators, the lubricating property is naturally important. Particularly, because the temperature in the compressor is high, the viscosity which can hold the oil film necessary for the lubrication is important. The required viscosity is different depending on the type of the compressor used and working conditions, and it is generally preferred that the viscosity (kinematic viscosity) of the lubricating oil before mixing with a refrigerant is 5 to 200 cSt, more preferably 5 to 100 cSt, at 40°C. When the viscosity is lower than this range, the oil film becomes thin to cause insufficient lubrication. When the viscosity is higher than this range, efficiency of the heat exchange is decreased.<br><br>
Electric refrigerators and air conditioners have a motor and a compressor integrally built into a single body, and the lubricating oil for them is required to have a high degree of electric insulating property. In general, a volume intrinsic resistance of 1012 Qcm or more at 80°C is required. When the resistance is lower than this value, possibility of leak of electricity arises. Moreover, high stability is required for a lubricating oil. For example, when organic acids are formed by hydrolysis or the like, corrosion and wear of the apparatus tend to take place although degree of the corrosion and the wear depends on the amount of the organic acids.<br>
As the refrigerant for compression-type refrigerators, particularly for air conditioners, mainly chlorodifluoromethane (hereinafter referred to as R22) or a mixture of chlorodifluoromethane and chloropentafluoro-ethane in a ratio by weight of 48.8 and 51.2 (hereinafter referred to as R502) has heretofore been used. As the lubricating oil, various types of mineral oils and synthetic oils satisfying the required properties described above have been used. However, R22 and R502 are more rigorously restricted world-wide because there is the possibility that they cause environmental pollution such as the ozonosphere destruction. By this reason, hydrofluorocarbons represented by 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane, difluoromethane, pentafluoroethane, and 1,1,1-trifluoroethane (hereinafter referred to as R134a, R32, R125, and Rl43a, respectively) are attracting attention as the novel types of the refrigerant. The hydrofluorocarbons, particularly R134a, R32, R125, and R143a, are preferred as the refrigerant for compression-type refrigerators because<br><br>
they have little possibility of causing the ozonosphere destruction. However, the above hydrofluorocarbon causes a problem when it is used singly. For example, it is reported in "Energy • Shigen (Energy and Resources)" Volume 16, Number 5, Page 474 that (1) when R134a is applied to an air conditioner to replace R22, the pressure in opei-ation is lower, and the ability is decreased by about 40 % and the efficiency is decreased by about 5 % from those obtained by using R22; (2) R32 shows a higher efficiency but a higher pressure in operation than those obtained by using R22 and is slightly combustible; and (3) R125 has a lower critical pressure to cause decrease in the efficiency although it is not combustible. R143a has the problem of combustibility like R32.<br>
It is desirable that a refrigerant for compression-type refrigerators can be used without change in the structure of the currently used refrigerator. However, the above mixed hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants must be used actually because of the problems described above. More specifically, it is desirable in view of the efficiency that R32 and R143a which are combustible are used to replace R22 and R502 which are currently used, and R125 or R134a is mixed to R32 or R143a to provide the incombustibility. It is described in The International Symposium on R22 &amp; R502 Alternative Refrigerants, 1994, Page 166 that a mixture of R32 and R134a is combustible when the content of R32 is 56 % by weight or more. In view of the incombustibility, a refrigerant containing 45 % by weight or more of an incombustibile hydrofluorocarbon such as R125 and R134a is desirable although the content may be different depending on the composition of the z-efrigerant.<br><br>
On the other hand, a refrigerant is used under various conditions in a refrigeration system, and it is not desirable that the composition of the refrigerant containing hydrofluorocarbons is different to a great extent in various parts of a refrigeration system. The refrigerant is in the gaseous state as well as in the liquid states in one refrigeration system. Therefore, when boiling points of hydrofluorocarbons used as a mixture are different to a great degree, there is the possibility that the composition of the mixed refrigerant is different to a great extent in various parts of the refrigeration system because of the above reason.<br>
BoiHng points of R32, R143a, R125, and R134a are -51.7°C, -47.4°C, -48.5°C, and -26.3°C, respectively. Using R134a in a mixed hydrofluorocarbon refrigerant must be made carefully in view of the above consideration. Therefore, when R125 is used in a mixed refrigerant, it is preferred that the content of R125 is 20 to 80 % by weight, more preferably 40 to 70 % by weight. When the content is less than 20 % by weight, a refrigerant having a different boiling point such as R134a must be used in a larger amount in order to provide the obtained mixed refrigerant with the incombustibility, and the content is not preferable by the above reason. When the content of R125 is more than 80 % by weight, the efficiency is decreased, and the content is not preferable, either.<br>
From the reasons described above, a mixture of R32, R125, and Rl34a in a ratio by weight of 23 : 25 : 52 (hereinafter referred to as R407C), a mixture of R32 and R125 in a ratio by weight of 50 : 50 (hereinafter referred to as R410A), and a mixtui"e of R32 and R125 in a ratio by weight of 45 : 55 (hereinafter referred to as R410B) are preferred as the mixed<br><br>
refrigerant to replace the refrigerant of R22. A mixture of R125, R143a, and Rl34a in a ratio by weight of 44 : 52 : 4 (hereinafter referred to as R404A), and a mixture of R125 and R143a in a ratio by weight of 50 : 50 (hereinafter referred to as R507) are preferred as the mixed refrigerant to replace the refrigerant of R502.<br>
These mixed refrigerants are advantageous also because these refrigerants show small change in the composition when the refrigerants are placed into the apparatus or leak out of the apparatus.<br>
When R404A, R410A, R410B, or R507 is used to replace R22 or R502 in a compression-type refrigerator in which R22 or R502 has been used as the refrigerant, a lubricant is naturally required to have excellent compatibility with the mixed hydrofluorocarbon refrigerant and the other requirements described above which are a volume intrinsic resistance of lO- Qcm (80°C) or more and excellent stability and lubricating property.<br>
However, the lubricating oils which have heretofore been used in combination with R22 or R502 do not have an excellent compatibility with the mixed hydrofluorocarbon refi-igerants such as R404A, R410A, R410B, and R507. Therefore, a new lubricating oil suitable for these mixed refrigerants is necessary. When the refrigerants of R22 and R502 are replaced with new refrigerants, it is desired that little change in the structures of apparatus is required. It is not desirable that the structures of the currently used apparatus must be changed to a great extent by replacing a lubricant.<br>
As the lubricant having a good compatibility with these mixed<br><br>
hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants, polyalkylene glycol lubricants, polyo. ester lubricants, and carbonate lubricants have been known. The polyalkylene glycol lubricant has a low volume intrinsic resistance, and the polyol ester lubricants and the carbonate lubricants are easily hydrolyzed to cause a problem in the stability. Therefore, development of a lubricant showing compatibility with the above mixed hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants, having a high volume intrinsic resistance, and exhibiting excellent stability and lubricating property has been desired.<br>
Under the above circumstances, the present invention has an object of providing a lubricating oil for compression-type refrigerators which shows excellent compatibility with mixed hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants containing R125, such as R410A, R410B, R404A, and R507, which can replace chlorofluorocarbons causing environmental pollution, has a high volume intrinsic resistance, and exhibits excellent stability and lubricating property.<br>
The present invention has another object of providing an apparatus for refrigeration using the above lubricant and a mixed hydrofluorocarbon refrigerant containing R125, and a compressor for refrigerantx which is suitable for forming a refrigeration cycle in the above apparatus for refrigeration.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

properties, it was discovered that the above objects can be achieved by a lubrication oil comprising a polyvinyl ether compound having specific constituting units as the main component. The present invention has been completed on the basis of the discovery.<br>

The above compressors for refrigerants contain the above lubricating oil and a hydrofluorocarbon refrigerant containing pentafluoroethane.<br>

The lubricating oil for refrigerators of the present invention comprises the above polyvinyl ether compound as the main component. The kinematic viscosity of the lubricating oil before the oil is mixed with<br><br>
a refrigerant is preferably 5 to 200 cSt, more preferably 5 to 100 cSt, at 40°C. The average-molecular weight of the polyvinyl ether compound is generally 150 to 2,000. When a polyvinyl ether compound has a kinematic viscosity outside the above range, the kinematic viscosity of the polyvinyl ether compound can be adjust to a value within the above range by mixing with a polymer having a different kinematic viscosity.<br>
In the lubricating oil for refrigerators of the present invention, a single t3rpe or a combination of two or more types of the above polyvinyl ether compound can be used. The above polyvinyl ether compound can be used as a mixture with other lubricants.<br>
To the lubricating oil for refrigerators of the present invention, various types of other additives conventionally used in lubricating oils, such as load carrying additives, chlorine capturing agents, antioxidants, metal deactivators, defoaming agents, detergent-dispersants, viscosity-index improvers, oiliness agents, anti-wear additives, extreme pressure agents, antirust agents, corrosion inhibitors, pour point depressants, and the like, may be added, where necessary.<br>
Examples of the load carrying additive described above include: organic sulfur compound additives, such as monosulfides, polysulfides, sulfoxides, sulfones, thiosulfmates, sulfurized oils and fats, thiocarbonates, thiophenes, thiazoles, and methanesulfonic acid esters; phosphoric ester additives, such as phosphoric monoesters, phosphoric diesters, and phosphoric triesters (such as tricresyl phosphate); phosphorous ester additives, such as phosphorous monoesters, phosphorous diesters, and phosphorous triesters; thiophosphoric ester<br><br>
additives, such as thiophosphoric triesters; fatty acid ester additives, such as higher fatty acids, hydroxyaryl fatty acids, esters of polyhydric alcohols, and acrylic esters; organic chlorine additives, such as chlorinated hydrocarbons and chlorinated carboxylic acid derivatives; organic fluorine additives, such as fluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acids, fluoroethylene resins, fluoroalkyl polysiloxanes, and fluorinated graphite,; alcohol additives, such as higher alcohols; and additives of metallic compounds, such as salts of naphthenic acid (such as lead naphthenate), salts of fatty acids (such as lead salts of fatty acids), salts of thiophosphates (such as zinc dialkyldithiophosphates), salts of thiocarbamic acid, organomolybdenum compounds, organotin compounds, organogermanium compounds, and boric acid esters.<br>
Examples of the chlorine capturing agent include compounds having glycidyl ether group, epoxidized fatty acid monoesters, epoxidized fats and oils, and compounds having epoxycycloalkyl group. Examples of the antioxidant include phenols (such as 2,6-di-tert-butyl-p-cresol) and aromatic amines (such as a-naphthylamine). Examples of the metal deactivator include benzotriazole derivatives. Examples of the defoaming agent include silicone oils (such as dimethylpolysiloxane) and polymethacrylates. Examples of the detergent dispersants include sulfonates, phenates, and succinimides. Examples of the viscosity index improver include polymethacrylates, polyisobutylene, ethylene-propylene copolymers, and hydrogenated styrene-diene copolymers.<br>
The lubricating oil of the present invention is used for compression-type   refrigerators   which   uses   a   hydrofluorocarbon<br><br>
refrigerant containing R125. The hydrofluorocarbon refrigerant preferably contains 20 to 80 % by weight, more preferably 40 to 70 % by weight, of R125. When a hydrofluorocarbon refrigerant contains 40 to 70 % by weight of R125, it is not necessary that a refrigerant having a boiling point different to a great degree, such as Rl34a, is mixed in a large amount in order to provide the refrigerant with incombustibility, and the hydrofluorocarbon refrigerant shows a high efficiency. The hydrofluorocarbon shows little change in the composition when the refrigerants are placed into the apparatus or leak out of the apparatus. Preferable examples of the hydrofluorocarbon refrigerant include R410A, R410B, R404A, and R507.<br>
The refrigerating apparatus used in the present invention has a refrigerating cycle comprising a compressor, a condenser, an expansion mechanism (such as an expansion valve and a capillary tube), and an evaporator as the essential components, or a refrigerating cycle comprising a compressor, a condenser, an expansion mechanism, a drier, and an evaporator as the essential components. The refrigerating apparatus uses the lubricating oil of the present invention as the lubricating oil (the refrigerator oil) and a hydrofluorocarbon refrigerant containing pentafluoroethane as the refrigerant.<br>
It is preferred that the drier is packed with a drying agent which is made of zeolite having a pore diameter of 3.3 A or less. Examples of the zeolite include natural zeolites and synthetic zeolites. Zeolite having a volume of absorption of CO2 gas of 1.0 % or less at 25°C under a partial pressure of CO2 gas of 250 mmHg is more preferable.   Examples of the<br><br>
more preferable zeolite include commercial products having trade names of XH-9 and XH-600 which are products of UNION SHOWA Co., Ltd, When zeolite has a large volume of absorption of CO2 gas, the amount of absorption of fluorine ion is increased. This leads to decrease in the adsorption property and the strength at break which are required as the molecular sieve, and various troubles are caused.<br>
When the above drying agent is used, water can efficiently be removed while the refrigerant in the refrigeration cycle is not absorbed. Moreover, pulverization of the drying agent by degradation of the drying agent itself can be suppressed, and the possibility of choking pipings with the formed powder and abnormal wear by invasion of the powder into sliding parts of the compressor can be eliminated. Thus, the refrigeration apparatus can be operated for a long time with stability.<br>

Into a 2 liter autoclave made of SUS 316L, 12 g of nickel diatomaceous earth catalyst (a product of NIKKI KAGAKU Co., Ltd., trade name, N113) and 300 g of isooctane were placed. The charged autoclave was purged with nitrogen and then with hydrogen. After the pressure of hydrogen was increased to 30 Kg/cmG, the temperature was increased to 140°C and kept at 140°C for 30 minutes, and then the autoclave was cooled to room temperature. The cooled autoclave was purged with nitrogen, and 20 g of acetaldehyde diethylacetal was added to the autoclave. Then, the autoclave was purged with nitrogen again and then with hydrogen. After the pressure of hydrogen was increased to 30 kg/cmG, the tempex-ature was increased to 130°C and kept at 130°C for 30 minutes, and then the autoclave was cooled to room temperature. The pressure inside the autoclave was increased by the increase in the temperature, and at the same time, decrease in the pressure of hydrogen was observed because of the reaction of acetoaldehyde diethylacetal. When the pressure of hydrogen was decreased to a pressure less than 30 kg/cmG, hydrogen was added, and the pressure was kept at 30 kg/cmG. After the autoclave was cooled to room temperature, the pressure was released. Then, the autoclave was purged with nitrogen, and the pressure was decreased to atmospheric pressure.<br><br>
