The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
TECHNICALFIELD <br>
This invention relates to food suitable for improving clinical conditions of patients particularly with kidney failure or hectic failure, and more particular1y to pathological improvement food capable of being used for preventing or retarding a transition to hemodialysis treatment in kidney failure or decreasing the number of impementation of the hemodialysis therapy and preventing or lessening occurrence of accompanyinghyperammonemiainhepaticinsufficiency.<br>
BACKGROUNDART<br>
There has been so far known that dietary' fiber or nonfibrillary hydroscopi c carbon has a function of increasing the excretion amount of nitrogen into feces without digesting dietary fiber or non-fibrillary hydraulic carboninthe smallintestineofthehumanor animal. Thisisdisclosed in, fbrexample, Sealock, R. R., Basinski, D. H. &amp; Murlin, J. R.: J. Nutrition, 22,589-596 (1941); Mason, V. C. &amp; Palmer, R. M.: Proc. Nutr. Soc., 32, 82A, 83A(1973); Weber.F. L Gastroenterology: 77, 518-523(1979); and Steven, A., M. &amp; Cummings,J.H.:Proc,Nutr.Soc.,38,141A(1979).<br>
An application example for applying the dietary fiber to renal disease is disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Publication HEI02-101016A. This publication discloses preparation for improving renal disease, which contains the dietary fiber as an active ingredient made from the hull of edible seed. The publication suggests that the dietary fiber made from the hull is effective at prolonging the life of a rat with acute kidney failure resulting from renal ligation. However, since the case of acute renal disorder of renal ligationhas no appicationto achronic disordercaseofa human andrtis uncertainwhetheromot the dietary fiber is effective in the treatment of renal disease, various kinds of dietary fibers are dealt with indusively in the publication. Thus, there is an undesirable possibility of side effects such as diarrhea due to dietary fiber intakeincreasedsimply.<br>
For the meanwhile, it has known that 40% to 70% of nitrogen in the feces are derived from fungal proteinwithinintestinal bacteria. whichmakes useofammoniaproducedbydecomposition ofureasecreted into the intestine to convert the fungal protein. -See Wrong, 0. M. &amp; Vince, A.: Proc. Nutr. Soc, 43, pp.77-86(1984)-<br>

kidney failure by positively using the urea secreted into the intestine for of fungal protein synthesis of the intestinalbacteriaintheintestine.<br>
The medical guideline recommended by Japanese Society of Nephrology provides restriction of proteinintake(0.5to0.6pykgbodyweight)forpreventifingcreaseofureanitrogeninthebiood(BloodUrea Nitrogen<br>
BUN) of a renal failure patient ("Lrfestyle guidance and dietary advice for patients with renal disease" combed by Japanese Society of Nphrology). In addition to the restriction of protein intake, ingestion of qualif protein having high biological value (such as animal protein, fishery product whole egg, etc.)isrecommended.<br>
To accomplish this purpose, low-gluten wheat is recommended as kidney failure diet, and therefore, there havebeendevelopeda gooddealoflow-protein foodofhigh-biologicalvalue. Further, variousdietar* suppements and elemental diets containing essential amino acid in a balanced manner have been devised andused.<br>
Although high-protein food of high-biological value is recommended for patients with hectic failure, high-calorie elemental diets containing branched-chain amino acids (valine, leucine and isoleucine) have been devised and used for hepatic disease, because such amino acids provide promotion of insulin secretion and suppression of formation of trypopan-derived serotonin or other brain amines by being antagonistic to trypcphan with respect to blood-brain barrier to prevent hpatic coma and cause awakening, and arginine containedintheaminoacidsactivatesureacycle.<br>
However, the aforesaid diets are mere food or enteral nutrient having a function of decreasing the supply of low-molecular-weight nitrogen-containing confounds such as urea and ammonia or raise hopes for producing sytomatic improvement through the provision of high-biological value protein or food composed of amino acid at an appropriate ratio of concentration designed in mixture. However, these diets do not fulfill the purpose and function of decreasing BUN since excretion of ingested nitrogen-containing confounds to the outside of the body through the route other than the principal metabolic excretion system orperipheralroute.<br>
As a result, when the low-molecular-weight nitrogen confounds such as urea derived from protein and amino acid in the diet are accumulated in the blood befond the filtering ability of the kidne" of a renal failureptientthenitrogencompundswillbedischargoutsideofthebodybyhemodifilltration<br>
Besides the dietetic treatment as noted above, there have been often used medicinal agents such as activated charcoal and cation-exchange resin for absorbing or inactivating ammonia drawn into the intestine to discharge or remove the ammonia as feces so as to decrease the blood ammonia level in the patient with hepaticfailur.<br>

There have been the following guidelines of alimentaiy therap for accorrflishing the purposes describedabove.<br>
(l)Quantitativerestrictionanoqualitativeenrichmentoprotein:<br>
It isrecommendable to quantitatively restrict the intake of protein and qualitative^ enrich the quality of the protein in order for reducing the burden of nitric metabolite and preverrting decrease in kidne" function. In general, low-protein diets (0.6 g/kg bod1' weight for kidne5' feilure, and 1.2 to 1.5 g/kg body weight for hectic failure) bring about an effect of slowing the deterioration in kidne* failure or hepatic failure. Since the dietary treatment should extend over a long period of time, it is necessary to select the diets of high protein value protein score) so as to regulate the balance of essential amino acids ("Lifesyle guidance and dieted advice for patients with renal disease" confiled tfJaynese Socief of Nephrology, Tokyoigakusha (1998), and "Nutritional diagnostics of liver diseases / Liver disease and nutritional theray', Akiharu WatanabeandMisakoOkrta.DaHchiShiuppanpublisingCo.ltd pp.53-68(1992))<br>

It is general important to satisf the quantity and balance of required essential amino acids by low proteindiets.<br>
Under the conventional technology it is necessar* to give foods of high-biological value and having low total content of nitrogen to a patient with renal feilure so as to reduce protein intake, which foods are Wared in such a manner that the Wortion of better protein in the foods is increased for infroving the quality of protein intake and reducing the total content of nitrogen or by using amino acids, especially, essential amino acid confounds having desirable relative Wortions of the amino acids.

The medicine using the hemodialysis treatment for discharging the low-molecular-weight nitrogen-containing confounds from the blood will impose not only tremendous temporal, financial, Wsical and psycho!ogical burdens upon the patient, but also create more problems such as a large social burden of medical costs covered by a medical e^ense insurance. Such dialysis medical e^enses will tend tobeincreasingfromnowon.<br>

escalated in the blood due to the hepatic failure has a bearing on the drculation c^de of the intestine and blood. As a medical formula for discharging the ammonia to the outside of the body there has been recognized a dose of chemical absorbing agent such as activated charcoal and cation-exchange resin is effective as a medical su"5!7. However, heavy dosage of the absorbing agent having a possible side effect laces an enormous burden to the patient Under the drcumstances, a need has been felt for an effective solutioncapableofreducingtheburdensinvo!vedintreating.<br>
Thus, the present invention seeks to provide a superior solution of the aforementioned problems involvedintreatingapatientwithkidneyfai!ureomepaticfailure. <br>
DISCLOSUREOFTHEINVENTION<br>
The inventors of this invention has found the solution for attaining the objects described above, by administering indigestible polysaccharides as food having energy required for protein synthesis by bacteria, which isdiftlculttodigestaccordingtodigestiveenzyme and mavbe ingestedas foodaccordingtointestinal bacteria, for the Wose of making use of low-molecular-weight nitrogen-containing confounds that are drained into the intestine and drculated in the reingested state as ingredients for fungal protein synthesis of intestinal bacteria to reduce the finandal and tenforal burdens involved in undergoing the hemodialysis treatment without taking any drug medidnes having potential adverse effects. This invention could be achievedonthestrengthofthisbiochemicalknowtedge.<br>
That is, the present invention provides patho!ogical infrovement food composed chiefly of indigestible ^saccharides and having restricted addition of protein confonents, which contains trace metal.vrtaminand/orfatasrequired.<br>

BESTMODEFORCARRYINGOUTTHEINVENTION<br>
Theinventionwillbedescribedhereinafterindetail.<br>
First, as to indigestible pol ysaccharides, starch and glycogen falling into polysaccharides are digested into glucose in the small intestine by digestive enzyme such as amylase in saliva or pancreatic fluid so as to be ingested into the bod1'. Meanwhile, the ^saccharides t^rfied by cellulose that isresistant to hydrolysis by the digestive enzyme have been known as dietary fiber (Dietar1' Fiber, M i ps\&amp; 1953). However, lactic acid bacilli and bifidobacteria that belong to intestinal normal inhabitants in the large intestine can export certain dietary fiber, and specifically, these enterobacteria can easily take in water-soluble dietar7 fiber fectine, gum, oligosaccharide, alginic acid, chrtosan, etc.) The dietar7 fiber exported by the intestinal normal inhabitants is termed as indigestible ^saccharide. Polydextrose used in this invention is relative of oligosaccharideanctfallsintotheindigestibl^oPs^<br>
Concretely speaking, the aforementioned indigestible polysaccharides include pectine, that is in an a^e, strawberry and citrus, seaweed-derived alginic acid, fucoidan, crustacean chitin, chitosan, gums such as acacia gum, arum root-derived mannan, agar, polydextrose that is glucose polymer, testa-derived water-soluble dietar7 fiber (hemicellulose) such as com, soybeans and psyllium, and sugar alcohol and polymersofsugaralcohol.<br>
Of these polysaccharides, a compound made up of polydextrose and pectine has been used suitably. The proportion of the confound is preferably 0.05 to 100 parts by weight of pectine to 100 "arts of polydextrose. The inventorshave knowledge that such a confound brings about the most prominent effect of lowering BUN without causing diarrhea in ingestion thereof. For unknown reasons, it is conceivable that the polydextrose and pectine are different in use-efficienc7 owing to intestinal bacteria such as lactic acid bacilli, consequent^ to further facilitate the activity of the lactic acid bacilli because of difference between theminmetabolicrate.<br>
Oftheaforesaid substances.the pectinecan easiPbemadefromana^leorcitrus fruitorobtainedas a co-productinthemakingofcitrusdrinks.<br>
There can be produced alginic acid and fucoidan from seaweeds, arid the chitin and chitosan from crustacean shells with sinfle operation. The polydextrose can be made by polymerizing a natural product such as glucose as a basic ingredient in the presence of citric acid. Avariety of testa-derived water-soluble dietaryfibersarecommerciallyavailable.<br>
The pathological irrfrovement food according to the invention contains more than 5% by weight, preferably, 40% to 70% by weight of indigestible ^saccharide as a chief ingredient relative to the solid<br>

content of the food in terms of dried foodstuff. When exceeding 70% by weight, the food is like!y to be viscous1consequentlytomakefoodprocessingdifrlcurt<br>
The restriction of protein component in the food has a meaning of addition thereof within the range which does not raise blood urea nitrogen when ingesting with the indigestible polysaccharides and the proteincontentis50% oriessreiativetothefoodofakind. Tobe more specffic,theproportonoftheprotein component (i.e. protein and its partially hydrolyzed protein fe'Hide)) to the solid content is made to 8% or iessbyweight,preferablyaboul2%byweightintenTisofdriedfoodstufT.<br>
The indigestible polysaccharides according to the invention contains, as basic ingredients, singly the aforementioned indigestible polysaccharides or confounds combined with several kinds of indigestible ^saccharides controlled in sweetness and acerbity with sweetener such as sucrose, fructose, glucose and sugar alcohol or natural sweetener such as luohan fruit essence and citric acid. To strengthen the effect of a dietar* su^ement, the indigestible polysaccharides of the invention may additional? contain sodium salt, potassium sajt, magnesium salt and calcium sal and further the needed volume of trace metals such as Zn, Fe, Cu, Co, Mn, Cr and Se inthe formofthea^roved foodadditives. To further strengthen the effect ofthe dietary su^ement, the indigestible ^saccharides of the invention may additional? contain, as a primary body, substances fortified with a suitable quantfty of vitamins such as vitamin A, vitamin B family (e.g. B1, B2, B6,B12andnicotineacid),vitamin C,VrtaminE,andfolic aad,essentialfattyatidoromega-3fat. The indigestible polysaccharides of the invention may be produced in the form of a liquid (drink), jelly or cream or in a solid or semisolid form like a biscuit cookie, bread, noodles, cake, ice cream, and sherbet and can be givensing^orincdmbinationtoa^tientwrrjikidn^failureom^aticfailure.<br>
It may be preferable to make a variety ofthe indigestible ^saccharides according to the invention with variations so as to kee13 the patient from being bored by being flavored with fruit juice such as of an a^le, lemon, strawberry, blueberr* mandarin orange, orange, pomegranate, litchee, ^nea^e, papaya and banana.orflavoringagents.<br>
Through e^eriments using ^gs, it has been actually demonstrated the fact that the indigestible polysaccharides of the invention have a significant effect of reducing urinal excretion of nitrogen-containing low-molecular substances and excreting almost all the ingested nitrogen into faces (Lecture Abstract of 76th Meeting of The Japanese Society of Swine Science; Lecturers: Yamamoto et al., The Japanese Journal of Swine Science, Vol.38(4), p.227 (2001)). Yamamoto et al. announced in the meetingthaturinaryureaexcretionwas decreasedto one-tenthwhenraisehearth^gsfor sevendayswitha feed of low-protein feeding stuff (nitrogen intake 35.5 grams per day on an average) mixed with 30% by weightofapplejuicelees(dried foodstuff). The nitrogenequivalenttothesubstance takenupbyfeces could beretrieved.<br>

The experimental results using the Pigs siPort the possibilrty that the diet containing indigestible polysaccharides brings about significant effects of lowering the concentration of nitrogen-containing low-molecular substances in the blood of a hectic failure patient so as to hold over treatments with hemodialysis or reduce the number of treatments with hemodialysis, or lowering the concentration of blood ammonia level of a kidney failure patient to prevent hePatic coma. However, the experimental results using the pigs do not always indicate the effectiveness of the pathological improvement food of the invention in treating the patients with kidne* failure and hepatic failure from the viewpoint of the dose of the indigestible Po^saccharidesaPPliedtothePigsforexPerimentalPurPose.<br>
To put it another way, the pathological improvement food of the invention, which chiefly contains indigestible polysaccharides, can take various forms such asdrink, cream, biscuit,bread, cake, ice creamand provide various textures by diversely combining different kinds of indigestible polysaccharides or determining the amount of each ingredient, or the pathological improvement food of the invention may be made in the form of powder composed ofrequired ingredients. Therefore, desirable diet food as mentioned abovemaybemadeinthehomeaccordingfothePatient<br>
The t^cal of indigestible ^saccharides is pectine. The pectine is contained in P|enty in an aPPle and<br>
citrus fruit and remains in existence in high concentration in fruit juice lees. Thus, the pectine can be<br>
extracted from the lees and processed into a dry product upon being de-esterified with acid or alkali and<br>
purified. It may also be processed in such a manner of being extracted from the a^e, pericarP of citrus fruit or<br>
vegetable, de-esterified with acid or alkali, filtrated, concentrated, Precipitated with alcohol to be cleansed,<br>
dried and broken into powder. The pectine may be taken out bybeing refined for use in this invention in the<br>
manner described above, but a^e juice lees or fruit juice lees of citrus fruit (mandarin orange, orange,<br>
grapefruit, etc.) may be used as the1' are for the same Wose as the refined pectine because these juice lees<br>
arerichinpectine.  Thatis.thePectinetermedinthisinventionindudesft^	lees.<br>
Likewise, alginic acids and fucoidan, which are made from seaweed, and polydextrose made from glucose as a basic ingredient in the presence of citric acid can be used as the indigestible polysaccharide. These indigestible polysaccharides for use in the invention should not necessarily be understood as being limiteo^otherefinedproducteaslongastheeffectoftheinventionisnotnjined.<br>
The ^saccharide becomes viscous when dissolving in water because it can absorb large volume of waterintoitspolymerstructure. Therefore,whentheindigestiblePolysaccharideisusedinthePreParationof a beverage, the concentration thereof is desirably 0.5% to 30% by weight Also, it is preferable to determine the concentration of the same to 2% to 30% by weight for creamy food, 2% to 30% by weight for je!lylike food,and5%to60%byweightforcakes,and5%to60%byweightforeJriedfoodssuchasbis

considered to be fundamental to maintenance of Wsical functioning, such as Mg, Zn, Fe, Cu, Co, Mn, Cr and Se due to unbalanced diet Likewise, a patient undergoing hemodialysis treatment often lacks ingestion of the trace metals due to exteriorize thereof during hemodialysis, consequently to possibly cause renal anemia.<br>
The pathological infrovement food of the invention may contain 0.01 % to 5.0% by weight of trace<br>
metalsina freestateor intheadditive formofmetal-containing yeast(e.g. "MineralYeasf'made ^Oriental<br>
Yeast Co., Ltd.) The pathological improvement food thus produced even containing such trace metals does<br>
not have a disagreeable smell endemic to metal nor nasty taste and can be made in safety. The<br>
su^lementation of trace metal condensates deficiency of the patient and activates the intestinal bacteria.<br>
Thus, the pathological improvement food composed chieflyofthe indigestible polysaccharides according to<br>
the invention can be further elevated in availability. To be more specific, the ingestion of the indigestible<br>
polysaccharidecontributes toreducethelevelof blood ureaandlow-moleculamitrogen compounds suchas<br>
ammonia, consequently to promote a^etite su^ression and eliminate a lowering factor for metabolic<br>

TTte present invention provides effective means capable of decreasing the amount of nitrogen reabsorbed from the intestine into the bloodstream to su^ress the rise of concentration of the low-molecular-weight nitrogen-containing confounds in the blood through the exquisite biodynamic mechanism in which the low-molecular-weight nitrogen-containing confounds such as urea discharged from the blood (through the blood vessel) into the intestine are effected for protein sVrthesis of intestinal bacteria and passed out with feces. To accom^ish the intended means, the food prepared with the indigestible polysaccharide, which is not easily exported by digestive enzvme but is effective for the irrtestinalbacteria,therebytomakeuseofferesuFtert<br>
lntrinsically, the low-molecular-weight nitrogen-containing compounds in the blood such as urea and ammonia are secreted into the intestine with the bodily fluid and reabsorbed, thus being circulated between thefluidintheintestineandtheblood. Therefore.thenitrogen-containinglow-molecularsubstancessecreted into the intestine can be utilized as a nitrogen source working on the protein synthesis of intestinal bacteria and discharged to the outside of the 000* as feces upon prorrferating the fungus bodies, thereby to break off the circulation of nitrogen-containing confounds between the intestine and the blood, resulting in a lower concentration in the blood. Thus, the excretion of the confounds effects alleviating of a burden on the<br>

kidne*.<br>
The reduced burden of the kidney causes degeneration of kidney glomerulus to be retarded, so as to have an expectancv to retard a transition to hemodiaPsis treatment and decrease the number of hemodialysis.<br>

Also, when the pathological improvement food having the function of driving the fungal protein synthesis of intestinal bacteria with ammonia secreted into the intestine and excreting the ammonia with feces is given to a patient with hepatic failure after each meal and/or between meals, the problems as above can be solved, so that distress involved in taking high doses of adsorbent agent can be relieved without producinganysideeffectaccordingtotheinvention.<br>

Adiet food maybe made bymixing5% to 30% bVeightofindigestible polysaccharides into noodle while reducing starch as flour as small as equivalent to the indigestible ^saccharides. In this case, the amount of indigestible ^saccharides to be added should be adequately determined based on the protein content in the flour or cereal starch so as to moderate the intake of protein to 0.6 g/kg body weight or less or 1.2to1.5g/kgbodyweighferday.<br>
The indigestible polysaccharides may be used as the basic ingredients of frozen desserts and confectioner1'. There may be added 5% to 20% by weight of polydextrose of the indigestible ^saccharides. The semisweet ^Fdextrose is suitable for confectioner*. Addition of 1% to 5% of citrus pectine such as of an a^le or strawberr* gives the confectioner* more sweet taste. The quantities of the principle ingredients of the confectioner1' such as milk and egg or protein components derived therefrom should be moderated to acconrtfish the objects of the invention.
