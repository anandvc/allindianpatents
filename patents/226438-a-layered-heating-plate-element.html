				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a plate element with layered heating.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is known in general that electrically conductive thin multiplayer systems can be<br>
used as resistance heating members by applying an electrical voltage to them.<br>
There are many applications of this technique both in the automobile industry<br>
and in buildings.<br>
It is often used to rid misting or ice from window panes or mirrors, so as to be<br>
able to easily see through the glass. However, such plate elements can also be<br>
installed on walls in or on buildings, instead of the usual heaters, or can be<br>
incorporated into them. For this purpose, they do not necessarily have to be<br>
produced in the form of windows, but may be in the form of mirrors, decorative<br>
surfaces, etc. Where appropriate, it is also possible to use such plate elements<br>
in general for the production of surface heat in technical equipment, for example<br>
in domestic electrical appliances, in which their small thickness and their smooth<br>
surfaces, which gather little dirt and are very easily cleaned, may offer great<br>
advantages.<br><br>
In general, these multiplayer systems deposited on flat substrates, for example<br>
glass panes, comprise at least one metal layer, for example made of silver, and<br>
(in transparent multiplayer systems) dielectric layers on both faces of the silver<br>
layer, optionally also blocking layers made of very varied materials and<br>
sometimes also covering layers intended to increase the mechanical strength of<br>
the layered structure. In many cases, the infrared radiation reflection properties<br>
of these multilayer systems are used as thermal insulation.<br>
The use of such layer heaters requires relatively high electrical voltages. In<br>
particular at the edge of the pane in question, which may be completely coated,<br>
it is necessary to provide reliable<br><br>
electrical isolation.<br>
The original features are disclosed in document DE-Al-40 11 541 in the form of<br>
an electrically heated toughened alarm glass. By means of a separating line<br>
traced by a laser beam, a partial region of the electrically conductive coating for<br>
heating this glass is electrically isolated from the main surface region of the<br>
coating. The partial region is used as a sensor for detecting breakage of the<br>
toughened glass in question. This partial region may be mounted in a laminated<br>
pane or also in an insulating glazing unit. It is preferable to use a multiplayer<br>
system that can withstand a high thermal load and that may already be<br>
deposited on its surface before the glass is toughened.<br>
Original features are also disclosed in German patent application 10208552.6,<br>
which describes such a plate heating element to be used with a mains voltage.<br>
For isolating the external edge of the plate element, a partial surface is<br>
electrically isolated from the surface region of the coating, with heating power<br>
supply, by at least one peripheral cut line and is neutralized without any<br>
electrical connection.<br>
Patent US 3 892 947 describes a plate element made of fragile material, provided<br>
with a coating for heating, in which a conducting ribbon intended for feeding in<br>
the current extends along practically the entire outer perimeter of the element.<br>
The objective to be achieved is thus to cut off the supply of current by a local<br>
interruption in said conducting ribbon in the event of the plate element breaking.<br><br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a plate element with layer heating of<br>
this type but adapting a separate partial surface of the plate element.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the invention, there is provided a layered heating plate element.<br>
By connecting the partial surface to a ground potential,, even higher protection is<br>
achieved, by its	<br><br>
simple electrical isolation from the actual heating<br>
field. This may prove to be beneficial in particular<br>
when the heating field is used with relatively high<br>
voltages (for example a standard national mains voltage<br>
of 110 or 230 V).<br>
The partial surface and the heating coating<br>
may in principle be produced independently of each<br>
other and even made from different conductive<br>
materials. It would for example be possible to produce<br>
the heating coating in a known manner in the form of a<br>
transparent multilayer system and, in contrast, to<br>
produce the partial surface with a printed conductive<br>
ink (for example a screen printing paste with a high<br>
silver content), where the two must be carefully<br>
separated from one another by a high<br>
electrical/galvanic resistance. A conducting ribbon, of<br>
the type known from the aforementioned US patent, could<br>
also be provided as a protective conductor near the<br>
edge, on or in the plate element, the coating then<br>
extending not right: up to the region of the surface<br>
covered by the conducting ribbon or alternatively the<br>
partial surface, by being subsequently removed<br>
therefrom, or else an appropriate insulation being<br>
provided between the continuous coating and the<br>
conducting ribbon or alternatively the partial surface.<br>
Preferably, the partial surface and the<br>
heating coating will however be produced in a uniform<br>
manner known per se and the partial surface will be<br>
subsequently separated by one or more separating lines.<br>
It goes without saying that the coated substrate is<br>
itself not conductive.<br>
If at least two parallel separating lines are<br>
provided between the coating and the partial surface,<br>
it may be advantageous to divide the coated narrow<br>
strip remaining between them into several parts<br>
isolated from one another. Thus, current flow along<br>
this narrow strip is prevented. As isolation, it is<br>
again possible to use short transverse separating<br>
lines.<br><br>
In all the cases, the partial surface is,<br>
according to the invention, electrically connected in a<br>
unipolar manner to a grounded protective conductor.<br>
Such protective conductors ("protective contacts") are<br>
the norm, these being known as third conductors in<br>
European domestic electrical systems.<br>
Preferably, a grounded partial surface on<br>
each free edge of the plate element will be provided<br>
along the outer edge of the element. In the case of a<br>
freely mounted plate element, the partial surface will<br>
preferably extend around its outer perimeter.<br>
According to one advantageous embodiment, an<br>
electrical connector will be provided for the partial<br>
surface in spatial proximity to the connectors for the<br>
heating coating. This allows a particularly simple<br>
construction of the set of external electrical contacts<br>
for the plate element.<br>
Of course, it is possible to provide, in a<br>
manner known per se, several current paths on a plate<br>
element according to the invention, where appropriate<br>
to be connected independently of one another, in order<br>
to be able when necessary to connect or disconnect the<br>
heating power in stages.<br>
The length and the width of the current path<br>
or current paths and the surface conductivity in ohms<br>
per square) of the multilayer system used are<br>
parameters that determine the electrical power<br>
consumption and the heating power of the plate element.<br>
Depending on the available or predetermined service<br>
voltage, it is possible to adjust and render uniform<br>
various heating power levels within wide limits by the<br>
arrangement of the current paths. The maximum<br>
permissible temperature will also depend on the<br>
operating range of the finished plate element. For<br>
example, if any direct contact by the user is not<br>
possible or envisioned, the temperatures may be<br>
substantially above 50°C. However, adhesive layers<br>
possibly bonded to the coated pane;, for example<br>
adhesive films for a laminated pane, should of course<br><br>
be prevented from being damaged by the temperatures reached in normal<br>
service.<br>
Provision is made in a preferred embodiment of the plate element for the rigid<br>
pane provided with the coating to be laminated to the coated surface with<br>
another electrically nonconductive plate or in all cases one that is isolated from<br>
the coating. In the region of the electrical connectors, provision may be made in<br>
an advantageous improvement for there to be, in one of the rigid panes, a<br>
recess through which the necessary mains conductors may be led.<br>
Such a plate element is advantageously used in glazing for windows, or in<br>
mirrors, or in heaters, or else in domestic electrical appliances requiring surface<br>
heat to be produced.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Other details and advantages of the subject matter of the invention will become<br>
apparent from the accompanying drawings of illustrative examples and from<br>
their detailed description that follows.<br>
In these drawings, which are schematic representations not drawn to scale :<br>
figure 1 shows a view of a plate element with a heating coating and divided<br>
by separating lines;<br>
figure 2 is an enlarged view of the connection region of the plate element as<br>
shown in figure 1; and<br>
-figure 3 shows a simple example of an electrical circuit for the plate element.<br><br>
DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE<br>
INVENTION<br>
In figure 1, a plate element 1 comprises a toughened pane 2, one main face of<br>
which - in this case the upper face- is covered with a complete electrically<br>
conductive coating 3. The coating 3 may be visually transparent, but this does<br>
not necessarily have to be so Preferably, it is composed of a multiplayer system<br>
having a high thermal resistance, with at least one metal layer, which is<br>
deposited before the pane 2 is toughened.<br>
Traced peripherally in the coating 3 along the edge of the pane 2 is at least one<br>
fine separating	<br><br>
line 4 a short distance - 1 to 2 cm - from this edge.<br>
It is also possible to provide several parallel<br>
separating lines 4 a short distance apart. A peripheral<br>
outer edge strip 5 thus formed, here shaded light gray,<br>
is electrically isolated frorr. the larger remainder of<br>
the coated surface. It forms an edge isolation for the<br>
plate element 1, which firstly ensures electrical<br>
isolation to the outside and secondly prevents<br>
corrosion of the coating possibly appearing at the<br>
outer edge and propagating into the surface. Provided<br>
in the middle of said surface is also a field 6 in the<br>
form of a ribbon, electrically isolated by separating<br>
lines.<br>
However, this field does not necessarily have<br>
to be absolutely at the center of the coated surface,<br>
but it may be placed elsewhere than the center in<br>
relation with an appiropriate arrangement of the active<br>
conductive tracks of the coating 3. Nor does it have to<br>
be in the form of a ribbon or be straight, rather it<br>
could also have any surface shape or even be angled or<br>
curved.<br>
The separating lines mentioned up until now<br>
and hereafter form, in the coating, high-electrical-<br>
resistance interruptions through which no current can<br>
flow. The outer edge strip 5 is therefore completely<br>
isolated electrically from the coating.<br>
A branch 5T of the coated edge strip 5<br>
extends at one point over a certain distance into the<br>
surface of the coating 3. It is isolated from the<br>
coating 3 by two other parallel separating lines 7.<br>
Said branch terminates in a connection region 8<br>
(indicated by a dot-dash circle) which is surrounded by<br>
the coating 3. The separating lines 7 extend separately<br>
or are joined together into one,. where appropriate<br>
broad, line beyond the connection region 8 up to a<br>
separate field 6. A neutral layer region possibly<br>
enclosed between the two separating lines 7 may if<br>
required be divided into parts electrically isolated<br>
from one another.<br><br>
It is not absolutely necessary to lead in the<br>
branch 5T as a straight line and at a right angle to<br>
the edge of the plate. It would also be possible,<br>
instead of the strip shown here, to provide a larger<br>
surface, for example a triangle, the base of which lies<br>
on the edge of the plate and the apex of which lies in<br>
the connection region.<br>
Electrodes 9 and 10 are provided in the<br>
connection region 8 on either side of the separating<br>
lines 7 and of the branch 5T, each of these electrodes<br>
9 and 10 being electrically/galvanically connected to<br>
the coating 3. The electrodes must each be connected to<br>
a pole of an electrical voltage (not shown in detail).<br>
An appropriate connection device is described in the<br>
prior patent application 1024172 8.8, to which reference<br>
will be made here.<br>
As may be more clearly seen in figure 2,<br>
another electrode 5E is provided on the branch 5T. This<br>
other electrode is used to connect the branch 5T and<br>
the entire edge strip to a protective conductor. The<br>
connector needed fcr this purpose is also located in<br>
the connection region 8 and may be housed without any<br>
difficulty in the abovetnentioned connection device by<br>
means of slight modifications,<br>
Figure 3 shows an example of a symbolic<br>
circuit element of a plate element according to the<br>
invention. The electrodes 5E, 9 and 10 are indicated as<br>
connection points. The electrode 5E connected to the<br>
edge strip 5 is connected to the ground potential. The<br>
two electrodes 9 and 10 connected to the coating 3 -<br>
shown as a resistance heating element - are connected<br>
to a suitable voltage supply 12. To complete the<br>
circuit, the figure shows a switch 1.3, for connecting<br>
or alternatively disconnecting the heating current, and<br>
a regulating member 14 for regulating the heating<br>
power.<br>
Preferably, the electrodes are manufactured<br>
in a manner known per se with an ink that is a good<br>
electrical conductor, is resistant to heat and<br><br>
printable by screen printing. Preferably, this screen-<br>
printing ink or paste has a very high silver content.<br>
The electrodes 9, 10 and 5E are preferably printed<br>
before the pane 2 is toughened and are baked during the<br>
heating needed for the thermal toughening operation. If<br>
a plastic substrate is used for the plate element,<br>
baking is of course not possible, or only moderately.<br>
In this case, it does not matter whether the<br>
electrodes 5E, 9, 10 are applied to the already<br>
deposited coating 3 or whether the coating 3 is<br>
deposited only after the electrodes have been formed,<br>
for example printed, on the pane.<br>
To determine a defined path for the heating<br>
current through the surface of the coating 3, said path<br>
is in total divided, in a mariner known per se, by a<br>
number of other separating lines 11 into a series of<br>
parallel current paths that extend between the two<br>
electrodes 9 and 10 and are also electrically connected<br>
in parallel.<br>
In an actual heating plate element, other<br>
measures will be taken to make the heating power of<br>
these tracks uniform. These measures do not, however,<br>
form part of the subject matter of the present<br>
invention; on the contrary, reference may be made for<br>
this purpose to the prior patent application<br>
10259110.5, which describes possible measures.<br>
Plate elements of the type illustrated in<br>
figures 1 and 2 are suitable, for example, for mounting<br>
in insulating glazing units, in which the corresponding<br>
spacing frame must be simply bonded to the edge strip<br>
5. The grounding of this edge strip, described here,<br>
furthermore ensures that a spacing frame used, which<br>
may be made of metal, is reliably grounded.<br>
Likewise, such plate elements may be hung<br>
directly in front of a wall or may be incorporated into<br>
the latter, without these elements being provided<br>
beforehand with a rear covering, provided that it is<br>
guaranteed in another way that the electrical service<br>
voltage entails no risk for the users. Finally, they<br><br>
may be incorporated without any problem in laminated<br>
panes in which it: is necessary to place the active<br>
heating coated face on the inside of the composite and<br>
to use an adhesive layer appropriate to the surface<br>
temperatures.<br>
The external connectors for the plate element<br>
may be brought out of such a composite or out of such<br>
an insulating glazing unit in principle via one of the<br>
end faces, for example in the form of printed<br>
conducting tracks or of connectors via flat strips.<br>
However, if the connection region is located in the<br>
surface of the plate element, it is also possible to<br>
provide, in one of r,he rigid panes joined together, a<br>
recess intended for the passage of the external<br>
connectors. In the case of an insulating glazing<br>
element, it is then also necessary to ensure that the<br>
intermediate space of the glazing unit is sealed in the<br>
region of this recess, for example by means of an<br>
annular spacing frame known per se.<br>
The electrodes themselves are opaque (as a<br>
result of their high content of conductive materials,<br>
such as silver, and their substantially greater<br>
thickness compared with the coating icself) and they<br>
may, however, be visible from the uncoated side of the<br>
pane 2. They are therefore masked from view; but they<br>
may also form, for example., decorative elements -<br>
unlike the simple semicircular shape shown in the<br>
drawings - in order to form a flat logo of the company<br>
or manufacturer. Furthermore, it is also possible to<br>
obtain certain color effects, by coloring the<br>
conductive screen-printing paste preferably used to<br>
manufacture the electrodes.<br><br>
