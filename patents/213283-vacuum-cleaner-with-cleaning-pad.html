VACUUM CLEANER WITH CLEANING PAD<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to vacuum cleaners.<br>
More particularly, the present invention relates to a stick- type or hand-held vacuum cleaner which is combined with a cleaning pad having a removable cleaning sheet.<br>
Background of the Invention Stick vacuum cleaners are well known in the art.<br>
These vacuum cleaners are typically more lightweight than traditional upright cleaners and lack the driven brushrolls of traditional cleaners. The 'lighter weight and lack of a brushroll allows these cleaners to be more easily manipulated by a user. They can also be employed on a wider variety of surfaces than traditional upright cleaners.<br>
For example, stick vacuum cleaners are often used on non-carpeted floor surfaces where a brushroll may damage the floor surface. The Stick vacuum cleaner is also often used for surfaces with hard-to-reach areas or elevated surfaces. The lighter weight and more compact design of a stick vacuum compared to a traditional upright vacuum leads to greater maneuverability and ease of lifting.<br>
As with any other vacuum cleaner/ dirt-laden air is drawn into a stick vacuum cleaner through a nozzle by a suction that is created by a suction motor driving a suction fan or impeller. The dirt-laden air passes into a dirt collection receptacle such as a dirt cup or filter bag. The dirt is held in the receptacle and the air is exhausted.<br>
An alternative to the stick vacuurA is the hand-held vacuum cleaner. Some hand held vacuum cleaners employ a powered rotary brush while others merely use a nozzle for suctioning dirt and debris from carpets, floors, and above floor surfaces.<br>
Hand-held vacuum cleaners have become extremely popular for cleaning a variety of surfaces in homes, offices, cars or the like. They are utilized particularly for small pick up jobs or for cleaning in hard to reach places. By their nature, hand-held vacuum cleaner units are lightweight in order to enable a user to readily utilize thefn in places where canister, upright, stick or shop-type vacuum cleaners cannot be used or are inconvenient to use.<br>
Of course, non-powered cleaning implements are also widely known. They are used for removing dust, dirt and/or liquids from hard surfaces. Brooms are one example. More recently, a cleaning implement which comprises a handle and a cleaning pad with a removable cleaning sheet has become popular for cleaning dry surfaces. The cleaning sheets exhibit the ability to pick up dust and debris<br>
2<br><br>
from the surface to be cleaned. Once dirty, the sheet is discarded and replaced with a clean one. One such product is sold by Procter &amp; Gamble under the trademark SWIFFERTM.<br>
This product uses non-woven sheets for dry dust- type cleaning. Such sheets typically utilize a composite of fibers where the fibers are bonded by adhesive, or are entangled in other ways. See for example U. S. Patent Nos.<br>
3,629, 047 and 5,144, 729. To provide durable wiping sheets, reinforcement means are combined with staple fibers in the form of continuous filament or network structure. Such cleaning sheets maximize the surface of the sheet and have electrostatic properties for collecting and/or attracting particulate dirt.<br>
However, cleaning implements that comprise a removable cleaning sheet are not able to successfully remove larger debris or particles from the surface to be cleaned.<br>
Such debris may include animal hair or fur, dirt, sand or small pebbles brought in from outdoors, food crumbs or other larger particles of debris.<br>
Thus, it would be advantageous to provide a cleaning product which combines the features of a vacuum cleaner such as a stick-type vacuum cleaner or a hand-held vacuum cleaner with a cleaning pad that comprises a removable cleaning sheet. Accordingly, it is desirable to develop a new and improved cleaning product which would overcome the foregoing difficulties and others and provide a cleaning pad in combination with a vacuum cleaner.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>

The vacuum cleaner A is illustrated to be of the stick-type and includes a suction nozzle 10, a housing 12 connected to the suction nozzle, a suction fan and motor assembly 16 (Figure 7) which is mounted to the housing, and a dirt collecting receptacle 18 which is also mounted to the housing and is in communication with the suction nozzle and suction fan and motor assembly. A support plate 20 is also connected to the housing and selectively holds a disposable cleaning sheet 30 (Fig. 10) for collecting dust and debris from a surface to be cleaned.<br>
The vacuum cleaner further includes a handle 40 which extends from a first end 42 of the housing, A grip 38 extends from a distal end of the handle. The support plate or cleaning pad member 20 can be<br>
5<br><br>
mounted to the housing at a housing second end 43 by a pivotable joint, such as a conventional universal joint 44, which interconnects the housing with the support plate. As is well known, the universal joint allows the housing and the handle to pivot along two rotational axes "b" and 'fc".<br>
With reference now to Figures 2 and 3, the housing 12 is mounted to a first fork 41 of the universal joint via spaced apart and generally parallel flanges 45, 46 of the housing. Pins 39 extend through aligned holes in the flanges 45,46 and the fork 41 for pivotably mounting the housing to the universal joint.<br>
Referring to Figure 10, the universal joint has a second fork 47 which is interconnected with the support plate at spaced apart flanges 48, 49 of the support plate for pivotably securing the support plate to the housing.<br>
The second fork 47 has a rotational axis perpendicular to the axis of the first fork 41. Flanges 48,49 are interconnected with fork 47 via dowel pins or plugs 50 which extend through holes 51,53 of the connecting members and holes 57,59 of the second rotational joint. Caps or seals 54 secure the pins 50 within the holes of the connecting numbers and joint 47. The two forks 41 and 47 can be secured to each other along a base plate 67 thereof by conventional means, such as gluing, welding or the like, depending on the material from which the forks are made.<br>
Alternatively, the entire joint member can be of one piece.<br>
With continued reference to Figure 10, the support plate 20 comprises a plurality of attachment structures or slitted attachment clips 52 which are configured to receive and retain the cleaning sheet 30 about the support plate during use. The clips are described in detail in U. S.<br>
Patent No. 6,305, 046, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The clips 52 are disposed adjacent the corners of the support plate, although these locations can be varied depending upon the size and shape of the support plate. The disposable cleaning sheet 30 is thus releasably attached to the support plate using the clips 52.<br>
As best seen in FIG. 4, the attachment structures each comprise a base triangle 60 which is defined along two sides thereof by slits 6l which extend through the flexible material which forms the attachment structures. An apex 62 of the base triangle is formed by the intersection of the slits 61. The attachment structures further include a plurality of pie wedge-shaped sections 63 having apexes 64 which meet at a substantially comjnon point 65. This arrangement permits the pie wedge-shaped sections to individually deflect relative to each other under finger pressure so that a portion of the sheet can pushed through the top surface or the attachment structures and "into a cavity (not shown) formed within the attachment structures.<br>
6<br><br>
As the sheet is pushed past the top surface of an attachment structure or clip 52, the apexes of the pie wedge-shaped sections and the apex of, the base triangle can pierce and engage the sheet 30 such that the sheet is retained about the support plate during use. As is known, the attachment structures can be formed from polyethylene by injection molding and can be retained within the support plate by a ridge (not shown) disposed on the support plate which engages a slot disposed on the attachment structure.<br>
While clips 52 are shown for selectively attaching the cleaning sheet 30 to the support plate 20, it should be appreciated that a variety of other structures can be used for the same purpose. For example, cooperating hook and loop fasteners may be provided on the support plate and the sheet. Also, an elastic band could be secured around the periphery of the sheet. The band can be smaller in its normal state than the diameter of the support plate, thus allowing the sheet to be selectively secured to and detached from the support plate simply by enlarging the band to fit it, and the periphery of the cleaning sheet, over the support plate.<br>
The support plate includes a top surface 21 to which the clips 52 are attached and a bottom surface 22 (Figure 6) around which extends the cleaning sheet 30. The bottom surface of the support plate engages at least a portion of the cleaning sheet during use. As shown in Figure 6, the support plate 20 has a convex shape as is described in detail in published U. S. Patent Application No.<br>
US2002/0050016 Al, dated May 2,2002, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Referring to Figures 4 and 10, a bumper 24 surrounds the outside edge of the support plate.<br>
The bumper can be made of foam, rubber, or another elastic or flexible-material.<br>
With reference again to Figure 10, the removable cleaning sheet 30 comprises a scrubbing layer 31. The scrubbing layer 31 is the portion of the cleaning sheet that contacts the soiled surface during cleaning. As such, materials useful as a scrubbing layer must be sufficiently durable that the layer will retain its integrity during the cleaning process. For example, an electrostatic cloth or pad may be used. The sheets can be made of polyester or polypropylene and build a negative charge as they are rubbed over a surface. This is known in the art. Close contact transfers electrons from the dirt to the cleaning sheet, increasing its negative charge. Hair and dust particles are positively charged and are thus attracted to the sheet.<br>
It should be appreciated that when a cleaning sheet is used in combination with a cleaning solution, an absorbent layer (not illustrated) may also be employed with the scrubbing layer in order to absorb liquids. Of course, thicker liquid absorbing sheets could also be used if desired. For example, a microfiber sheet with an internal sponge layer could be employed. Alternatively, a cleaning sheet having an absorbent layer can be wetted with a cleaning solution prior to installation on the support<br>
7<br><br>
plate. This will ensure that the cleaning solution is deposited on the surface being cleaned and the scrubbing layer can remove additional material from the surface being cleaned. Whether the cleaning sheet is used with a cleaning solution (i. e., in a wet state) or without cleaning solution (i. e., in a dry state) the cleaning sheet will, in addition to removing particulate matter, facilitate other functions, such as polishing, dusting, and buffing the surface being cleaned. It is also conceivable that packets of pre-wetted cleaning sheets could be sold by a merchant to the customer for use with the cleaning device of the present invention.<br>
When each sheet becomes dirty, it is simply discarded and replaced by a new, clean one.<br>
As previously discussed, a problem that exists with cleaning implements employing cleaning sheets is that the cleaning sheets cannot effectively pick up or retain larger debris, such as granular material, larger dirt particles, food crumbs, or pebbles or debris brought in from outdoors, etc. Thus, it would be convenient to have a vacuum source attached to the cleaning implement to vacuum the larger particles that the cleaning sheet cannot effectively pick up.<br>
Thus, in a first embodiment of the present invention, a stick-type vacuum cleaner is used in combination with the support plate and cleaning sheet. In this embodiment, the dirt collecting receptacle 18 is in the form of a dirt cup. As shown in Figure 9, the dirt cup is positioned within an opening or cavity 55 of the housing.<br>
The dirt cup is secured into place via a latch 56 or other fastening mechanism. The dirt cup can be at least partially transparent and can be fabricated from a thermoplastic material. The latch 56 releases a spring biased tab 58 from a slot 70 formed in an open first end 72 of the dirt cup.<br>
With continued reference to Figure 9, the dirt cup has open first end 72 and a closed second end 76. A second tab 74 extends from second end 76 of the dirt cup and engages in a corresponding cavity 78 in the housing. The latch assembly 56 facilitates the removable connection of the dirt cup to the housing. When the dirt cup is removed for cleaning, the user depresses the latch causing the tab 58 to release from the slot 70 (best shown in Figure 7) in the dirt cup. Cleaning of the dirt cup entails removal of dirt from the dirt cup by lifting filter assembly 90 (Figure 8) out of the dirt cup. This also allows cleaning of the filter medium or cloth or replacement of the filter assembly or the filter medium.<br>
Referring to Figure 7, an inlet 80 is formed in the second end of the dirt cup and communicates with an outlet 82 of the suction nozzle. An outlet 81 is formed in the first end of the dirt cup which communicates with an inlet 83 to the suction fan and motor assembly. A flapper valve 86 prevents the dirt in the dirt cup from falling back into the suction nozzle outlet 82. The flapper valve can be made of rubber or another known flexible material.<br>
8<br><br>
Referring now to Figure 8, a filter assembly 90 is removably attached to the dirt cup first end 72. The filter assembly includes a filter cage 92 upon which a filter medium 94 is mounted. In this embodiment, the filter medium can be made of a porous cloth or similar conventional material which can be glued or otherwise secured to the cage. The filter cage includes an end wall 96 on a first end thereof and an open frame 98 at a second end thereof. A filter gasket (not illustrated) can be disposed about a periphery of the upper surface of end 96. A gasket would function to seal the dirt cup cavity. Alternatively, the material of the filter cage 92 can be flexible enough to serve a gasket function for sealing the filter cage against an inner wall 91 of the dirt cup. The end wall 96 of the filter cage is keyed, as at 93, to insure that the cage can be mounted to the dirt cup 18 only in one orientation. The recess forming the key 93 accommodates the slot 70 of the dirt cup as shown in Figure 7. The end wall 96 also includes a centrally positioned opening 97 (see also Figure 7) through which air cleaned by the filter can flow out of the open end 81 of the dirt cup.<br>
Referring now to Figure 6, a conduit 100, in the form of a flexible hose in the preferred embodiment, extends between and connects the outlet of the suction nozzle 10 to the inlet 80 of the dirt cup. A first end 102 of the hose connects to the suction nozzle, a central portion 101 extends through an aperture 103 in the base plate 67 of the universal joint and a second end 104 connects to the dirt cup inlet via housing inlet 118 (Fig. 9).<br>
Referring again to Figure 10, the suction nozzle 10 is pivotably connected to the support plate via a pair of spaced apart arms 106,108 which extend from a rear end 110 of the nozzle. The arms 106,108 each have a hole 112,114 respectively through which pins 50 extend to rotatably secure the suction nozzle to the support plate. With reference now to Figure 5, each of the arms has a pair of adjacent concave sections 116, 117 defined in a lower surface thereof. The sections can each engage or ride upon a resilient detent 119,120 provided on respective sides of the support plate top surface 21. The detents can snap into respective slots 121,122 located on the top surface 21 of the support plate. The suction nozzle is manually pivoted or rotated to one of two positions, a "down" or operating position, shown in Figure 3 and an "up" or non-operating position, shown in Figure 5. The sections ride along the detents until the suction nozzle is locked into one of the two positions. In the operating position, the suction nozzle is substantially parallel to the surface to be cleaned for vacuuming. The non-operating position enables the support plate and cleaning sheet to clean a surface without the nozzle interfering with or blocking access to the surface to be cleaned. Also, the sheet 30 can, if dirty, be removed and replaced when the nozzle is in the up position.<br>
With reference again to Figure 6, the hose 100 is positioned adjacent, and can be seated within, a curved portion 124 of the support plate 20. The hose is also bent or curved to extend from an approximately horizontal orientation adjacent the outlet of the suction nozzle to an approximately vertical orientation adjacent inlet 118 (Figure 9) of the housing. As shown in Figure 7, inlet 118 is<br>
9<br><br>
positioned adjacent inlet 80 of the dirt cup. The hose extends through the universal joint assembly as best seen in Figures 6 and 10.<br>
When the vacuum cleaner is in use, the air follows a short and efficient flow path. Referring again to Figure 7, dirt laden air is drawn in through a suction inlet 126 of the suction nozzle and moves up through the suction nozzle, and out the suction nozzle outlet 102 (Figure 6) into the conduit or flexible hose 100. The dirt laden air is then drawn through the hose and into the inlet 118 of the housing to the inlet duct 80 of the dirt cup. A seal (not illustrated) can provide an effective seal between the conduit and the inlet duct of the dirt cup. The air is then drawn up into the dirt cup through the valve 86 and enters the dirt cup cavity. Heavier dirt particles fall by gravity down towards a base wall 127 of the dirt cup. Lighter particles are drawn up towards the filter cloth 94 as the air is pulled into the interior via the filter assembly.<br>
The filter medium or cloth traps smaller dirt particles that have not fallen to the base of the dirt cup. These, then either fall towards the base wall 127 or are held in or on the filter medium.<br>
Substantially clean air is then drawn into the interior of the filter assembly and passes through the dirt cup outlet 81 via opening 97 in the first end wall 96 of the filter cage. Once air passes through the outlet and enters the suction fan 16 through fan inlet 83, clean air is then blown into the motor chamber, across the motor assembly and out through vents 130 (Figs. 3 and 11) defined in the housing. The filter assembly, the exhaust duct of the dirt cup, the fan inlet, and the suction fan and motor assembly can all be aligned along a longitudinal axis to promote efficient air flow. The entire housing 12 can be made from a suitable conventional thermoplastic material if desired.<br>
With continued reference to Figure 7, to operate the suction fan and motor assembly 16, an assembly switch 140 is provided on one of the handle and the motor housing.<br>
In one embodiment, the switch is located on the handle. The switch assembly includes a button 142 located on the grip 38 of the handle 40. The button 142 is manually depressed to activate a micro switch 144 in the housing. A linkage connects the button 142 to the microswitch 144. The linkage can include a first elongated rod 146 and a second elongated rod 147 which extend in an end to end relationship through, handle 40. By using a pair of elongated rods, along with spring assemblies 148, 149, no electrical power is lost between the microswitch 144 and the motor assembly. Button 142 is depressed which in turn moves rod 146 and rod 147 thus depressing microswitch 144. The microswitch completes a circuit which in turn powers the suction fan and motor assembly. The switch assembly thus operably connects the manually accessible button 142 to the microswitch 144 within the housing for powering the suction fan and motor assembly.<br>
10<br><br>
The switch 140 can be spring biased to an "off" position by springs 148 and 149. Thus, when the user manually depresses the switch to an "on" position, the circuit is completed and power is provided to the suction fan and motor causing them to operate. The switch however only provides momentary operation of the suction fan and motor and as soon as the user stops depressing the switch button it is biased back to the "off" position and the suction fan and motor are shut off.<br>
If desired, a battery pack 152 (Figure 7) can be used to provide power to the suction fan and motor. The suction fan and motor 16 produce a suction air flow when the button 142 is depressed.<br>
Alternatively, the switch 140 can be of a conventional "rocker" type, in which the switch is clicked to either an "on" position or an "off position. In this embodiment, to operate the suction fan and motor, switch 140 is depressed or moved to the "on" position and then clicks or locks into place, thus providing continuous operation of the suction fan and motor assembly. To shut off the suction fan and motor assembly, the switch would be depressed, to an "off" position and clicks or locks into place. This prevents any further operation of the suction fan motor until the switch is again depressed.<br>
Referring now to Figure 12, according to another embodiment of the present invention, a pocket 160 can be provided on a rear portion of a housing 12'for accommodating extra cleaning sheets 30'. Also, alternating current (AC) can be provided via a power cord 154 to a suction fan and motor and switch assembly of the vacuum cleaner.<br>
Referring now to Figures 19 and 19A, a suction nozzle 10'can include a wiper blade 165, which extends along a length of the suction nozzle behind a suction opening thereof, for wiping the surface to be cleaned of liquids or solid particles disposed on the surface. The blade 165 also protects a cleaning sheet (not shown) which is attached to a support plate 20', by blocking larger particles of debris from contacting the cleaning sheet, thus preventing abrasions or tearing of the cleaning sheet.<br>
In another embodiment, referring to Figure 13, a caddy 162 can be clipped or otherwise secured onto a handle 40"mounted on a housing 12"via a clip 164. The caddy can accommodate extra cleaning sheets. Referring to Figures 20 and 20A, in this embodiment, a suction nozzle 10"can include a bristle tuft assembly 166 having a series of tufts 167 extending along a length of the suction nozzle. The tufts help sweep particles of debris from the surface to be cleaned and prevent debris from contacting a cleaning sheet (not shown) attached to a support plate 20"which could cause damage to the cleaning sheet, such as abrasions or tearing.<br>
Referring now to Figure 14, a cleaning solution distribution system 170 can be selectively mounted on a vacuum cleaner of the type shown in Figures 1-11. The cleaning solution distribution system can include a cleaning solution bottle 172 containing a cleaning solution 174, and a removable cap 176. The cap 176 can be threadably secured to the bottle and is used to add cleaning solution to the bottle.<br>
11<br><br>
If desired, the cap can also include a control for a conventional valve system (not shown) that selectively allows a flow of the cleaning solution 174 out of the bottle 172. To this end, a tube 178'has a first end 179 connected to an end 180 of the bottle. A second end 181 of the tube is connected to a sprayer head 182 which sprays or discharges the cleaning solution onto a surface to be cleaned. The bottle can be selectively snapped onto a handle 190 of the vacuum cleaner, directly above a housing 192 thereof. To this end, a longitudinally extending groove 194 can be located on a rear side of the bottle 172. The sprayer head 182 can be adhesively or otherwise secured to a nozzle 196 of the vacuum cleaner. A dirt cup 198 of the vacuum cleaner can be removed from the housing 192 by pushing the hose 178 out of the way or by simply unsnapping the bottle 172 from the handle 190.<br>
Alternatively, a siphoning pump or a valve (not shown) can be connected to a trigger (not shown) on grip 38 to control the flow of cleaning solution from the bottle to the sprayer head. The cleaning solution is sprayed in front of the suction nozzle 196. A suitable cleaning sheet (not shown) having an absorbent layer attached to an outer layer, as is known in the art, can absorb most of the cleaning solution. In addition, it is possible that some of the solution can be suctioned by the suction nozzle and deposited within the dirt cup 198.<br>
According to yet another embodiment of the present invention, a portable hand held vacuum cleaner can be selectively mounted to a conventional cleaning implement.<br>
Referring to Figure 15, a hand held vacuum cleaner C includes a housing 210 having a first end 212 and a second end 214. A suction nozzle or head 216 is selectively connected to the housing first end 212 via a conduit such as a flexible hose 218. A dirt cup or container 220 is detachably mounted on the housing. The conduit extends from an outlet of the suction nozzle 216 to an inlet of the dirt cup. The suction nozzle further comprises a suction inlet 222. The internal configuration of a hand-held vacuum cleaner of this type is described in U. S. Patent No.<br>
