				<td>This invention relates to a filler-containing polymer dispersion and a process for the production of the same. Said dispersion contains organic or inorganic filler particles and particles of at least one synthetic organic polymer, the ratio of the particle size of the filler particles to the particle size of the polymer particles being in the range from 1.1:1 to 20:1.<br>
Polymer particles with a diameter of about 0.01 to about 30 Âµm play an important role in many areas of plastics technology. Adhesives or coating compositions containing polymer- particles with diameters in this range are frequently used in particular for bonding articles or for coating surfaces. Examples of the range of applications include decorative surface coating in the form of paint coatings or other coatings and the bonding of two surfaces having identical or different properties with adhesives of the type frequently encountered in the field of bonding.<br>
The polymer particles mentioned are generally produced by polymerization of olefinically unsaturated monomers of which the properties can be modified by the polymerization of mixtures of various monomers, for example by co- or terpolymerization. The modified properties of a single polymer particle are generally transferred as a collective property to a surface coating or bond prepared with the aid of such polymer particles. Collective properties which are often subjected to an application-related modification include, for example, hardness, elasticity and -above all in adhesive applications -bond strength, open time or early adhesion.<br>
Certain properties of the composition used to prepare the coating or the bond,<br>
for example the surface coating composition or the adhesive, are just as important. In<br>
this connection, viscosity, flow behavior or residual monomer content are often<br>
modified in dependence upon the desired	<br><br>
application.<br>
Inorganic or organic fillers are often added to a surface coating composition or an adhesive containing polymer particles to modify the above-mentioned properties of a surface coating or a bond. Inorganic fillers reduce the level of organic polymer material in the coating and thus contribute to greater hardness of the coating and to protection of the environment and raw materials through a lower content of organic polymers. Organic fillers are capable of imparting certain combined properties of the filler and polymer particles present therein, for example to a polymer dispersion.<br>
Whereas mixtures of polymer particles and fillers frequently lead to dull, rough surfaces in the field of surface coating, their effect in adhesrves is often that the strength and elasticity of adhesive bonds are greatly reduced. In addition, the presence of fillers in polymer dispersions often contributes to a reduction in early adhesive strength.<br>
Such effects are drastically noticeable above all in the field of high-quality applications of surface coatings and bonds, such as high-gloss paints and bonds in the paper or fumiture industry. For example, a significant reduction in ultimate adhesive strength on wood is often observed, accompanied by reduced early adhesion.<br>
EP-A 0 392 065 relates to polymer-coated filler particles where a filler core is coated with a membrane of a hydrophobic polymer. To produce these polymer-coated particles, a monomer is polymerized in aqueous dispersion in the presence of filler particles and an amphiphillc polymer. The document in question does not contain any teaching on the production of filler-containing polymer dispersions in which the fitter particles and the polymer particles are present substantially alongside one another.<br>
DE-OS 22 43 687 relates to an adhesive, more particulariy for the production  of corrugated  cardboard.     Although  this  document does<br><br>
describe a polymer dispersion in which polymer particles and mineral particles are present together and does indicate size ranges for the particular particles, it does not contain any teaching as to e particle size ratio along the lines of the present specification.<br>
Accordingly, the problem addressed by the present invention was to overcome the above-mentioned disadvantages of the mixtures of polymer particles and fillers known from the prior art. More particularly, the problem addressed by the present invention was to provide a filler-containing polymer dispersion which would have the advantages of the mixtures of polymer particles and fillers known from the prior art without any of their known disadvantages.<br>
Accordingly, a particular problem addressed by the present invention was to provide a filler-containing polymer dispersion which could be used for the production of high-quality surface coatings or bonds.<br>
Another problem addressed by the invention was to provide a filler-containing polymer dispersion which could be used as a high-strength adhesive, particularly on wood.<br>
A further pnsblem addressed by the invention was to provide a filler-containing polymer dispersion with a low residual monomer content.<br>
Yet another problem addressed by the invention was to provide an adhesive which would have an adequate open time, high early adhesion and a low viscosity coupled with excellent flow behavior.<br>
A final problem addressed by the invention was to provide a process for the pnxluction of such filler-containing polymer dispersions.<br>
The problems stated above are solved by a filler-containing polymer dispereion which contains organic or inorganic filler particles and particles of at least one synthetic organic polymer polymerized in the presence of the filler particles, the ratio of the particle diameter of the filler particles to the particle diameter of the polymer particles being in the range from 1.1:1 to 20:1.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a filler-containing polymer dispersion which contains water, particles of at least one organic or at least one inorganic filJer or a mixture thereof (filler particles) and particles of at least one synthetic organic polymer polymerized in the presence of filler particles of at least one type (polymer particles), characterized in that the ratio of the particle size of the filler particles to the particle size of the polymer particles is in the range from 1.1:1 to 20:1.<br>
It has been found that surface coating compositions and surface coatings, adhesives and adhesive bonds at least comparable with filler-free coatings, but superior to the filler-containing systems known from the prior art in regard to open time, bond strength and early adhesion can be obtained using the polymer dispersions according to the invention. In addition, the filler-containing polymer dispersions according to the invention generally have a lower viscosity and better flow behavior than the system known from the prior art with comparable polymer contents and filler contents.<br>
A process according to the invenfion for the prciduction of the filler-containing polymer dispersions is also distinguished from the polyÂ¬merization processes known from the prior art by the fact that it shortens the polymerization time in relation to comparable systems, porvides for easier temperature control and leads to polymer dispersions with a reduced content of residual monomers in relation to polymer dispersions produced by polymerization processes known from the prior art.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a filler-containing polymer dispersion which contains water, particles of an organic or inorganic filler (filler particles) or of a mixture of two or more organic or inorganic fillers or a mixture of two or more thereof and particles of at least one synthetic organic polymer polymerized in the presence of the filler or the fillers (polymer particles), the ratio of the particle size of the filler particles to the particle size of the polymer particles being in the range from<br><br>
1.1:1 to 20:1.<br>
Accordingly, the polymer dispersion according to the invention contains either inorganic filler particles of one type or organic filler particles of one type or inorganic filler particles of two or more different types or organic filler particles of two or more different types or organic filler particles of one type and organic filler particles of two or more different types or organic filler particles of one type and inorganic filler particles of two or more different types or inorganic filler particles of two or more different types and organic filler particles of two or more different types.<br>
So far as organic polymer partides in the dispersion according to the invention are concerned, the organic filler partides and the (likewise organic) polymer particles differ to the extent that the organic polymer particles are formed in the presence of the filler particles, i.e. the polymerization of the polymer particles takes place in the presence of the filler particles. The effect according to the invention is obtained even when the organic filler partides and the polymer particles have substantially the same monomer composition. In one preferred embodiment of the invention, however, the organic filler particles and the polymer particles have different monomer compositions.<br>
In the context of the invention, the temn "particle size" is understood to be the "d50" value, i.e. the value at which about 50% of the partides have a smaller diameter and about 50% of the particles have a larger diameter. In principle, this value may be determined by any particle measuring techniques, for example measuring techniques based on the principle of light diffraction. The particle size data appearing in the present specification were obtained with a MASTERSIZER X from Malvern Instruments, Herrsching, Germany (version 1.2b). The mode of operation of this instnjment is based on the diffraction of a light beam, the particle size being correlated with the diffraction angle.<br>
Other techniques for determining particle sizes include, for example.<br><br>
granulometry in which a uniform suspension of a small quantity of the powder to be investigated is prepared in a suitable dispersion medium and is then exposed to sedimentation. The percentage distribution of the particle sizes can be estimated from the conelation between size and density of the spherical particles and their sedimentation rate as determined by Stokes" law and the sedimentation time. Other methods for determining particle size include microscopy, electron microscopy, sieve analysis, sedimentation analysis, detemnination of the surface density and the like.<br>
"Polymer particles" in the context of the present invention are understood to be dispersed particles of a substantially water-insoluble synthetic organic polymer polymerized in the presence of an inorganic or oianic filler particle or a mixture of two or more such filler particles, as described above.<br>
According to the invention, suitable filler particles are any organic or inorganic particles which have a particle size (as defined above) of about 0.033 to about 10 pm, for example about 0.05 to about 5 pm or about 0.1 to about 4 pm or 0.2 to about 3 pm or about 0.5 to about 1.0 pm. According to the invention, particle size classification is based on the size of the primary particles.<br>
A "primary particle" in the context of the present invention is understood to be a partlde which is held together by primary ionic or covalent forces, for example in the fomi of a crystal lattice. In contrast to the primary particles, "secondary particles" are understood to be agglomerates of two or more primary particles which adhere to one another at the outer surfaces or boundaries of the primary particles under the effect of weak ionic forces or other polarity-based forces and which can be broken up into the primary particles with minimal energy, for example by simple mechanical dispersion and/or by addition of a dispersant which breaks up the particles by eliminating or reducing the weak binding forces<br><br>
between the primary particles.<br>
Filler particles suitable for the purposes of the invention are, for example, inorganic materials which are inert to the at least one organic polymer and during the production of the filler-containing polymer dispersion under the prevailing reaction conditions. Examples of suitable inorganic materials are aluminium silicates, for example andalusite, sillimanite, kyanite, mullite, pyrophyllite or imogolite.

The inorganic materials mentioned may be used individually, i.e. as filler particles of a single type, for the purposes of the present invention. However, a mixture of two or more types of the filler particles mentioned may equally well be used.<br>
Other filler particles suitable for the purposes of the invention are organic filler particles in the presence of which the polymerization of the polymer particles may take place. Suitable organic filler particles are, for example, polyvinyl acetate and copolymers of polyvinyl acetate with one or more polymerizable compounds, polystyrene, polyethylene, polypropylene, waxes, such as polyethylene wax, polybutylene, polybutadiene, copolymers of butadiene and styrene, polyacrylonltrile. resins, such as rosin or hydrocarbon resins, polyacrylate esters or polymethacrylate esters with linear or branched aliphatic, aromatic or cycloaliphatic alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, the isomeric butanols and higher homologs of the alcohols mentioned containing up to about 22 carbon atoms, cyclohexanol, benzyl alcohol and the like, polydialkyi maleates, such as dibutyl maleate and copolymers thereof or polymers containing<br><br>

In another preferred embodiment, the ratio of nonionic surfactant{s) to organic water-soluble polymers (based on weight) is about 0.01 to about 1.0%. The ratio of nonionic surfactant(s) to anionic surfacfant(s) (based on weight) in one preferred embodiment of the invention is about 5:1 to about 1:5, for example about 3:1 to about 1:3 or about 2:1 to about 1:2. In another preferred embodiment of the invention, the ratio by weight of nonionic surfactant to anionic surfactant is about 1.2:1 to about 1:1.2 or about 1:1.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the invention, the dispereion contains up to about 30% by weight, based on the dispersion as a whole, of additives. The additives Include, for example, stabilizers, defoamers, antioxidants, photostabilizers, pigment dispersants, fillere, pH adjusters, plasticizers and the like.<br>

The dispersion according to ihe invention may contain up to about 2% by weight and preferably about 1% by weight of UV stabilizers. Particulariy suitable UV stabilizers are the so-called hindered amine light stabilizers (HALS).<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the invention, the filler-containing polymer dispersbn contains about<br>
-	10 to 70% by weight of an organic polymer in the form of polymer particles,<br>
-	5 to 55% by weight of filler particles.<br><br>
-	0.05 to 0.5% by weight of a nonionic surfactant with an HLB value of 13 to 20,<br>
-	0.01 to 0.1% by weight of an ionic surfactant with an HLB value of 1 to 10.<br>
-	0.05 to 10% by weight of a water-soluble organic polymer with a molecular weight of more than 600 and an HLB value of more than 15 where inorganic filler particles are present in the polymer dispersion.<br>
-	24.89 to 84.89% by weight of water and<br>
-	0 to 30% by weight of other additives.<br>
If the polymer dispersion according to the invention contains only organic filler particles, a water-soluble organic polymer with a molecular weight of more than 600 and an HLB value of more than 15 may nevertheless be present in the dispersion together with the con-esponding other compounds. However, if only organic fillers are present, it is not absolutely essential to use a water-soluble organic polymer in order to obtain the effect according to the invention. If a water-soluble organic polymer with a molecular weight of more than 600 and an HLB value of more than 15 is to be used together with an organic filler or a mixture of two or more organic fillers, the quantity of water-soluble organic polymer with a molecular weight of more than 500 and an HLB value of more than 15 used will generally be smaller than it would for a comparable quantity of inorganic filler.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the present invention, the filler-<br>
containing polymer dispersion is prepared by emulsion polymerization. In<br>
the context of the present invention, "emulsion polymerization" Is<br>
understood to be a polymerization process In which monomers insoluble or<br>
poorly soluble in water are emulsified in water using emulsifiers and<br>
polymerized     using    water-soluble    initiators.	Suitable     emulsion<br>
polymerization processes are described, for example, in ComprehensivQ<br><br>
Polymer Chemistry, 4. 171-218, Elias (5th Edition), 2, 93 et seq; in Encyclopaedia of Polymer Science and Engineering, 12, 512 et seq and in Encyclopaedia of Polymer Science and Technology, 5, 801 ef seq. Other suitable references are known, for example, from the reference books known to the expert Ultmann"s EnzyklopSdie der technischen Chemie, Houben-Wey! (E20, 218-268) or Kirk-Othmer Reference is hereby expressly made to the cited literature references, the disdosures of those references being regarded as part of the disclosure of the present specification.<br>
Whereas the filler-containing polymer dispersions known fnm the prior art generally involve addition of the filler to the prepared polymer dispersion, the filler particles are present in the form of their primary particles in a dispersion before the beginning of polymerization of the monomers in the case of the process according to the invention.<br>
In one prefen-ed emtiodiment of the present invention, the dispereion of the filler particles is carried out in such a way that any agglomerates of fider particles present are separated at (east substantially, i.e. to a level of at least about 80 or 90% by weight, into their primary particles. This separation into the primary particles is generally promoted by the presence of emulsifiers or dispersants, as used in emulsion or suspension polymerization. However, any other form of separation of any filler particle agglomerates into the primary particles is also possible in the context of the process according to the invention, including for example ultrasonic de-agglomeration, flotation or electrokinetic techniques.<br>
Acconding to the invention, the filler-containing polymer dispersion is prepared by emulsion polymerization. To this end, a dispersion of the filler particles in water is preferably first produced. For example, an aqueous solution of an ionic surfactant is first prepared, the ionic surfactant used preferably being the surfactant which, subsequently, is also used in the emulsion polymerization.<br><br>
In another prefened embodiment of the invention, an aqueous solution of an organic water-soluble polymer with a molecular weight of at least about 600 and an HLB value of at least about 15 is first prepared.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the invention, an aqueous solution containing both an ionic surfactant and a water-soluble polymer with a molecular weight of at least about 600 and an HLB value of at least about 15 may also first be prepared.<br>
After the preparation of the solutions mentioned, the dispersion of the filler particles is prepared in a preferred embodiment of the present invention. To this end, the filler particles are dispersed in one of the above-mentioned solutions, the dispersion being stirred until any filler agglomerates present have been largely dispersed. In cases of doubt, for example where a new filler on which no experimental data are available is used, the dispersion of the filler particles and the dispersion of any agglomerates present may simply be followed by several successive measurements of the particle size distribution during the dispersion process. Separation into the primary particles is achieved when the particle size distribution differs only slightly, if at all, in two successive measurements. The dispersion of the agglomerates may optionally be influenced by influencing the temperature, the stirring speed or the emulsifier or mixture of two or more emulsifiers used. The effects of the proposed measures may readily be monitored and optimized for individual cases by measurement of the particle size distributbn.<br>
When a suitable dispersion of filler particles is present, the emulsion polymerization is continued. This is done, for example, by dissolving a polymerization initiator in the dispersion, heating the dispersion to a suitable temperature and then starting the polymerization reaction by dropwise addition of monomers. However, this procedure may also be replaced by any other procedure by which the emulsion polymerization can be earned out in the filler particle dispersion.<br><br>
In another prefen"ed embodiment of the invention, a preliminary emulsion containing the monomers or the monomer mixture and tiie filler dispersion may also be prepared by the procedure described above. This preliminary emulsion, which may optionally contain a polymerization initiator, may be added dropwise or in portions at a temperature suitable for the polymerization reaction.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention also relates to a process for the production of a filler-containing polymer dispersion, in which at least one radical-polymerizable monomer is subjected to emulsion polymerization in aqueous phase using a polerlzation initiator, the aqueous phase containing filler particles of at least one dispersed filler with a particle size (dSO) of 0.01 to 0.5 ijm, at least one water-soluble organic polymer with a molecular weight of more than 600 and an HLB value of more than 15 and at least one ionic surfactant. Suitable ionic surfactants are any of those listed in the foregoing.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the aqueous phase additionally contains a nonionic surfactant, suitable nonionic surfactante having already been described in the foregoing.<br>
In another prefen"ed embodiment of the invention, a water-soluble polymerization initiator, more particulariy a peroxo compound of an organic or inorganic acid, is used in the process for producing the polymer dispersion according to the invention.<br>
Suitable polymerization initiators are water-soluble initiators, such as tert.butyl hydroperoxide, sodium peroxodisulfate, peroxodisulfuric acid, cumene hydroperoxide, hydrogen peroxide, sodium or potassium percarbonate; azo compounds, such as diazolsobutyrodinitrile or benzoyl peroxide. Redox initiators, i.e. systems consisting of oxidizing and reducing agents, are also suitable. In many cases, water-soluble redox initiators contain transition metals, for example Fe/HO (I), although other basic components, for example the systems peroxysulfates/metabisulfates,<br><br>
peroxysulfates/thiosulfates or peroxidesrthiosutfates, may also be used.<br>
In one prefeired embodiment of the invention, sodium persulfate, potassium persulfate or ammonium persulfate is used as the polymerization initiator.<br>
According to the invention, the quantity of poiymerization initiator used is generally between about 0.01 and about 0.5% by weight, based on the dispersion as a whole. In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the total amount of polymerization initiator used is between about 0.03 and about 0.2% by weight, for example between about 0.05 and about 0.15% by weight.<br>
According to the invention, the total quantity of polymerization initiator may be present in the dispersion of the filler particles at the beginning of the polymerization process. In one preferred embodiment of the invention, however, the polymerization initiator is added in at least two batches at different stages of the polymerization reaction. For example, part of the total quantity of polymenzation initiator may be added before the monomer(s), the remainder being added in portions or continuously durirrg or after additJon of the monomer(s).<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the process according to the invention is carried out in at least two successive stages, a dispersion containing<br>
a)	at least one ionic surfactant with an HUB value of 1 to 10 or a nonionic surfactant with an HLB value of 13 to 20 or a mixture of two or more thereof,<br>
b)	at least one inorganic filler with a particle size (d50) of 0.01 to 0.5 pm,<br>
c)	at least one polymerization initiator and<br>
d)	at least one water-soluble organic polymer with a molecular weight of more than 200 and an HLB value of more than 15<br>
being prepared in a first stage and then heated to a temperature of 70 to 90Â°C and<br><br>
e)     at least one radical-polymerizable monomer being added and polymerized in a second stage.<br>
In another pr6fen"ed embodiment of the invention, the organic or inorganic filler particles or a mixture thereof are/is added before the polymerization initiator.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the process according to the invention, the organic filler or the inorganic filler or a mixture thereof is present substantially in the form of its primary particles before the polymerization.<br>
The polymerization temperature applied in the process according to the invention depends upon the choice of the monomers used and the polymerization process applied. For the monomers from the group of acrylates and vinyl acetate used in accordance with the present invention, the polymerization temperature in one preferred embodiment of the invention is in the range from about 80 to 90Â°C.<br>
The present invention also relates to the use of the filler-containing polymer dispersions in lacquers, emulsion paints, g)ues, adhesives, surface coating compositions or other surface coatings.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention also relates to an adhesive or a surface coating composition containing a filler-containing polymer dispereion according to the invention or produced by the process according to the invention.<br>
The invention is illustrated by the follovifing Examples.<br>
Examples.<br>
Production of a filler-containing polyvinyl acetate dispersion:<br>
1.1	200 g of vinyl acetate monomer were introduced into a monomer container.<br>
1.2	Preparation of the catalyst solution<br>
1.0 g of ammonium persulfate were dissolved in 3.0 g of water in a<br><br>
clean plastic container.<br>
1.3	Preparation of a premix<br>
592.3 g of water and 32.7 g of Vinol V-205 (manufacturer Air Products, Kentucky) were introduced into a clean container. The mixture was stirred and then heated to about 85 - 90Â°C, followed by stirring until the components had compiete}y dissolved (about 2 hours). The solution was then cooled.<br>
1.4	0.37 g of sodium fauryl ether sulfate and 0.12 g of Tergftol 15S9 (manufacturer Union Carbide Chemicals and Elastics (Europe) S.A.) were added. The mixture was homogenized for a few minutes, after which 100 g of chalk were added, the mixture being stined for about 30 minutes in order to break up the chalk into its primary particles.<br>
1.5	0.09 g of defoamer was added to this dispersion.<br>
1.6	Polymerization:<br>
The premix was then heated to BOÂ°C and 90% of the catalyst solution was added. The mixture was homogenized by stirring for 5 minutes.<br>
1.7	The vinyl acetate monomer was then added and the polymerization process was started and lasted about 3.5 to 4.0 hours.<br>
1.8	After the end product had been obtained, its physicochemical parameters and end use were investigated.<br>
2.       Residual monomer content:<br>
A dispersion according to the invention was compared with a dispersion obtained simply by mixing a polyvinyl acetate dispersion with chalk. The two dispersions were otherwise identical in their composition. Both dispersions were gas-chromatographica!ly analyzed for monomeric vinyl acetate. The investigatbns were carried out both by extraction and by the "head space method". The results are set out in Table 1.<br><br><br>
