Related Application<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Number 60/601,431, entitled "System And Method For Assuring Redundancy In Remote Access Solutions", filed August 13,2004.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The illustrative embodiment of the present invention relates generally to remote access servers, and more particularly to a system and method for mamtaining transaction integrity in a remote access solution during failure.<br>
Background<br>
Remote access solutions enable workers away from a company to securely access the company network. Through the use of IPSec VPNs or SSL VPNs remote users are able to access a company network in a secure manner. Access from a client device may be routed through one or more gateway servers which are utilized in maintaining the remote access session. With conventional remote access solutions, failure in a gateway server mamtaining the remote access session results in a terminated session and lost data.<br>
To address the issue of gateway server failure, a number of different conventional techniques have been applied in an attempt to ensure redundancy and full availability of system resources in the event of hardware or software failure. In an active/passive server arrangement an active server hosts a number of executing processes and applications. The active server may be hosting an IPSec VPN-based session or an SSL based session. One or more other servers are designated as backup or "failover" servers. The failover servers include the capability of executing the same applications and processes that are executing on the active server but the failover<br><br>
server(s) do not execute the applications and processes until notified of a problem with the active server. The failover servers are known as "passive" servers in this arrangement because they may be thought of as quietly waiting to execute the applications and processes that are being executed on the active server while the backup server is operating in failover mode. Once notified of a problem with the active server, one of the failover servers is selected as the new active server, receives the last saved state/session information from the formerly "active" server and proceeds to execute in the manner in which the previous active server was executing prior to the detected failure/problem. Unfortunately, the active/passive arrangement results in a loss of data during the transition from the first active server to the newly designated active server.<br>
It will be appreciated that the failover servers may be located on either the same or a separate physical node. An implementation that includes a failover server on the same physical node runs the risk that the failure causing the failover is associated with a physical node element that will also impact the failover server. Locating the failover server on a separate physical node that includes separate physical resources (e.g. memory, disk arrays, motherboard, etc.) lowers the risk of a single physical element causing both the active and failover servers to fail but increases the cost of the overall system in both hardware acquisition and management.<br>
Another technique to provide redundancy amongst servers is to arrange servers in an active/active arrangement In an active/active arrangement, both the active and passive failover servers are executing the same set of applications and processes. When the first active server goes down, the second active server allocates resources to those application instances and processes that were previously being handled by the failed server.<br>
Unfortunately, neither the active/passive nor the active/active failover server arrangement lend themselves to preserving session state for a remote access session. Neither conventional failover implementation allows a remote session state to be mirrored in a failover server such that the failover server may be transitioned to without terminating the existing session and losing session data. It would be desirable to be able<br><br>
to preserve an existing remote session and its session data in the event of a failure affecting an active server hosting the remote session.<br>
Brief Summary<br>
The illustrative embodiment of the present invention allows a remote session state to be synchronized between a primary gateway server and active failover servers. Incoming data sent from the client device to the primary gateway server hosting the remote session is transmitted to the active failover servers which are hosting mirror sessions. Acknowledgements of the receipt of the incoming data are not sent back to the client device from the primary gateway device until the distribution of the data to the failover servers has been confirmed. Requests to application resources from the remote session on the primary gateway server are allowed while those from the mirror sessions running on the failover servers are intercepted and discarded so as to prevent application resource conflicts. Data received in response to a request from the primary gateway server to an application resource running on back-end servers is similarly mirrored to the failover servers before being transmitted to the client device. The response is forwarded to the client device from the primary gateway server while being intercepted from the mirror sessions running on the failover servers. In the event of a failure affecting the primary gateway server, one of the failover servers hosting the mirrored sessions is elected as the primary active server and its permissions are changed to allow the newly elected primary gateway to communicate with the client device and with the application resources.<br>
In one aspect of the present invention, a system for providing failover redundancy in a remote access solution includes at least one application resource on a back-end server. The system further includes multiple gateway servers. One of the multiple gateway servers is designated as a primary gateway server while the other servers are designated as failover gateway servers. Each of the multiple gateway servers hosts a session with at least one executing application instance for the same application with each of the sessions on the failover gateway servers being maintained in the same state as the session on the primary gateway server. The primary gateway server is the only one of the gateway servers that is allowed to communicate with the application<br><br>
resource(s).  The system further includes a client device that is in communication over a VPN with the primary gateway server. The client device receives output of the application instance executing in the session on the primary gateway server over the VPN. The client device also sends input to the primary gateway server over the VPN. The received output is displayed on a viewer by the client device.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, a method for providing failover redundancy in a remote access solution, includes the step of providing at least one application resource on a back-end server. The method further includes the step of designating one of multiple gateway servers as a primary gateway server while designating the other servers as failover gateway servers. Each of the gateway servers hosts a session with at least one executing application instance for the same application. The primary gateway server is the only one of the multiple gateway servers that is allowed to communicate with the at least one application resource. The method further includes the step of maintaining the sessions on the failover gateway servers in the same state as the session on the primary gateway server. Additionally, the method includes the step of receiving at a client device in communication over a VPN with the primary gateway server the output of the at least one application instance executing in the session on the primary gateway server with the received output being displayed on a viewer by the client device.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
The illustrative embodiment of the present invention provides the ability to mirror session state from an active primary gateway server to an active failover server. By copying all of the received input from the client and all responses received from application resources, the failover sessions are able to be maintained in the same state as the session on the primary gateway server with which the client device is communicating. In the event of failure, the existing session can be transitioned to a failover server (which becomes the primary gateway server) without disrupting the session and with minimal loss of data.<br>
Figure 1 depicts an environment suitable for practicing the illustrative embodiment of the present invention. A client 10 that includes an agent 12 communicates over a network 20 with a front end server 30. The front end server 30 includes a distribution process 32. The distribution process 32 copies and distributes data received from the client device to an active remote session 42 on a primary gateway server 40 and mirror failover sessions 52, 62 and 72 on failover servers 50, 60 and 70.<br><br>
Application instances 44, 54,64 and 74 running on the respective active and failover sessions 42, 52,62 and 72 may request data from an application resource 82 hosted by a back end server 80. Responses from the application resource 82 to an executing application instance's request for data are returned to the distribution process 32 on the front-end server 30 for distribution to the active session 42 and failover sessions 52, 62 and 72.<br>
Referring now to Mgure 1 in more detail, the client 10 may be communicating<br>
over the network 20 by establishing an IPSEC VPN or an SSL VPN to a remote session<br>
(active session 42) established on the primary gateway server 40. The client may<br>
include a buffer 14 in which the agent 12 buffers a copy of the data sent to the primary<br>
gateway server 40 until receiving an acknowledgement from the primary gateway<br>
server. The network 20	may be the Internet, a local area network (LAN), a wide<br>
area network (WAN), an extranet, an intranet, wireless network, satellite network, or some other type of network capable of allowing the client 10 to communicate with the active session 42 on the primary gateway server 40. The primary gateway server 40, and failover servers 50, 60 and 70 may include Network Address Translation (NAT) tables 46,56,66 and 76 allowing the servers to perform NAT for an IP address assigned to the client 10 during the establishment of the remote session by the primary VPN server. As noted above, active session 42, and failover sessions 52,62 and 72 may include executing application instances 44, 54,64 and 74 which request data from an application resource 82 on a back-end server 80. As will be explained in greater detail below, failover servers 50, 60 and 70 also include filters 58, 68 and 78 which filter and discard requests to the application resource 82 from the failover sessions 52,62, and 72 while the failover servers are acting in failover mode. Responses form the application resource 82 to the request from an executing application instance 44 in active session 42 are routed to the distribution process 32 for distribution to the active session and failover sessions 52,62 and 72. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the location of the distribution process 32 may vary within the scope of the present invention in that it may be located in different network accessible locations other than on the front-end server and still perform the functions described herein.<br><br>
Still referring to Figure 1, and in more detail, in many embodiments, the client 10, front-end server 30 and the back-end server 80 are provided as personal computers or computer servers, of the sort manufactured by the Hewlett-Packard Corporation of Palo Alto, California or the Dell Corporation of Round Rock, TX.

The functions performed by the components depicted in the architecture displayed in Figure 1 may be further explained with reference to Figure 3. Figure 3 is a flowchart of the sequence of steps followed by the present invention to mirror data directed to the active session on the primary gateway server to the failover sessions on the failover servers. Following the establishment of the initial remote active session 42 on the primary gateway server 40(following authentication of the client 10) and the establishment of the corresponding failover sessions 52, 62 and 72 on the failover servers 50, 60 and 70, the front-end server 30 receives input from the client directed to the active session (step 300). The distribution process 32 on the front-end server 30 copies and distributes the input data to the active session 42 and failover sessions 52, 62 and 72 (step 302). The application instances in the active 42 and failover sessions 52, 62 and 72 then process the received data (step 304).<br>
The distribution process 32 then queries the active and failover sessions 42, 52, 62 and 72 to determine if the session states are synchronized (step 306). The verification of synchronization is necessary due to possible variances in processing speed amongst the servers and latency delays in the network. In alternate implementations, the primary gateway server 40 and the failover servers 40, 50 and 60 are configured to report their session state to the distribution process 32 without first being queried. In another implementation, a different process other than the distribution process has the responsibility of verifying the synchronization of the states of the sessions 42,52,62 and 72.   If the session states are determined not to be synchronized (step 307), a delay is implemented pending a further query from the distribution process to determine the synchronization status (step 306). If the session states are synchronized (step 307), the results of the processing performed by the application instance 44 in the active session 42 on the primary gateway server 40 are reported to the client (step 308). Attempts by application instances in the failover sessions 52,62 and 72 are filtered by the respective filters 46, 56 and 66 on the network stack and the packets discarded.<br>
A similar process is performed to keep the active and failover session states synchronized during a request by an application instance executing in a session for an application resource. Figure 4 is a flowchart of the sequence of steps followed by the illustrative embodiment of the present invention to request data from an application<br><br>
resource and mirror the response to the failover sessions. The sequence begins when the application instance 44 in the active session 42 (and the corresponding application instances 54, 64 and 74 in the failover sessions 52, 62. and 72) identify a needed application resource (step 320). The application instances 44, 54, 64 and 74 from all of the sessions then request the application resource 82 from the back-end server 80 (step 322). The requests originating from the application instances 54, 64 and 74 in the failover sessions 52, 62 and 72 are filtered by filters 58, 68 and 78 on the network stack of the respective failover servers 50, 60 and 70. The filtered packets are discarded (step 324). The request from the active session 42 is forwarded to the application resource 82 on the back-end server 80 (step 326). The response to the request is routed to the distribution process 32 on the front-end server (step 328). In one implementation, the response is sent to the primary gateway server 40 which is hosting the active session 42 first and is forwarded to the distribution process 32. In another implementation, a separate distribution process different from the one used to accept input data from the client maybe used to distribute application resource responses.<br>
Continuing with Figure 4, following the receipt of the response from the application resource, the distribution process forwards the response data to the active and failover sessions 42, 52, 62 and 72 (step 330). The application instances 44, 54, 64 and 74 in the active session 42 and failover sessions 52,62 and 72 then process the resource data (step 332). As with the data received from the client, a query is made to determine if the session states are synchronized (step 333). If the states are not synchronized the query is repeated until an affirmative response is received. Once the session states are synchronized, the application instance in the active session 42 communicates the results of its data processing to the client 10. The application instances 54, 64 and 74 on the failover servers also attempt to communicate their results to the client 10, but the packets are intercepted and discarded by the network filters 58, 68 and 78 on the respective failover servers 50,60 and 70 (step 334).<br>
In another aspect of the illustrative embodiment, the present invention may also be implemented in a "thin-client" or kiosk architecture where all of the processing is taking place on the server and only screen data is being pushed down to the client 10 from the remote session 42. Figure 5 depicts an alternate embodiment in which<br><br>
application screen buffers are kept synchronized for a remote session requested from a thin client or kiosk The client 400 may be a thin client with limited processing power such as a PDA or cell-phone or may be a publicly available kiosk terminal with a display and input device. The client establishes the remote session over the network 402 to a primary gateway server 410. The connection may be use RDP (Remote Display Protocol) from Microsoft Corporation or ICA from Citrix Systems, Inc. of Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The session may be established when the client 400 logs in via a secure web URL exposed by the primary gateway server. The primary gateway server accepts the connection request and establishes the remote active session 412. The illustrative embodiment also establishes failover sessions 422 and 432 on failover servers 420 and 430. The active session 412 and failover sessions 422 and 432 are similarly provisioned and include executing application instances 414, 424- and 434 respectively. Each of the application instances has an associated screen buffer 416,426 and 436 respectively. A distribution process 418 on the primary gateway server copies and distributes input data received from the client 400 to each of the sessions 412,422 and 432 in the manner set forth above. In an alternate implementation, the distribution process 418 may be located on a front end server. The application instances 414, 424 and 434 may request an application resource 442 from a back-end server 440 with the request from the primary gateway server being transmitted and the requests from the failover servers 420 and 430 being intercepted and discarded. As before, following the processing performed by the executing application instances 414,424 and 434, a response to the client 400 is delayed until all of the screen buffers 416,426 and 436 are in the same state. The contents (or changed contents when using optimization techniques) of the screen buffer 416 on the primary gateway server are then pushed down over the connection to the client 400. Attempts by the application instances 424 and 434 to push the contents of their screen buffers 426 and 436 to the client 400 are intercepted and the packets discarded.<br>
The-synchronization of session states performed by the present invention enables the transition of a remote session from a failed gateway server to a replacement gateway server without terminating a remote session and ensures a minimal loss of data. An agent 12 buffers a copy of the data sent from the client 10 (if a reliable protocol is being used such as TCP). The present invention does not return an acknowledgement of the<br><br>
receipt of data from the client until all of the session states have been synchronized. The agent 10 therefore buffers a copy of any sent data until the acknowledgement is received from the primary gateway server and then discards the data. In the event of any subsequent failure of the primary gateway server 40, the data sent by the client to the primary gateway server is present in one of the failover sessions. Similarly, the data received from the application resource is also distributed to both the active and failover sessions so that they remain synchronized. If an acknowledgement is not received from the primary gateway server, the buffered data is resent to the newly appointed primary gateway server.<br>
Additionally, when the remote connection is initially established, the IP address assigned to the client 10 is distributed not just to the primary gateway server 40 which in one implementation is performing NAT for the client, but also to the failover servers 50, 60 and 70. When a failure of the primary gateway server 40 is detected, one of the failover servers 50, 60 or 70 is selected as the primary gateway server and its attributes are changed to allow it to perform that role. The filter 58,68 or 78 present on the network stack that prevents the failover servers 50,60 and 70 from communicating with the client 10 and application resource 82 is disabled for the newly designated primary gateway server. The newly selected primary gateway server also intercepts any communications received from the client or directed to the client using the previously sent IF address and the NAT table 46, 56, 66 and 76 on the newly selected primary gateway. The combination of a mirrored session state and client IP awareness by the failover servers prior to the primary gateway server failing thus allows a smooth transition with minimal data loss and without the need to reestablish a new remote session.<br>
The detection of a failure of the primary gateway server 40 may happen in a number of different ways. The method used to detect the server failure may be dependent upon the manner in which the servers are deployed. For example, the primary and gateway servers may be arranged as nodes in a clustered computer system. Nodes in a clustered computer system frequently send each other "heartbeat" signals (which are also referred to as "responsive" or "activation" signals) over private communication channels. The heartbeat signals/tokens indicate whether the nodes are active and responsive to other nodes in the clustered computer system. The heartbeat<br><br>
signals are sent periodically by each of the nodes so that if one or more nodes do not receive the heartbeat signal from another node within a specified period of time., a node failure can be suspected.<br>
The final determination of a gateway server failure may be dictated by a failover policy controlling the gateway servers. The failover policy indicates under what circumstances the primary gateway server may be considered to have failed. For example, in the clustered computing system discussed above, in implementations which have multiple failover servers, the policy may require at least two failover servers to have not received the heartbeat token from the primary gateway server within the specified time period. Alternatively, the failover policy may require all of the failover nodes to have not received the heartbeat token from the primary gateway server. Those skilled in the art will recognize that a number of other techniques may be used alone or in combination to detect gateway server failure such as pinging the primary gateway server to determine its health. The pinging may be performed following the lack of the receipt of the heartbeat token in order to verify the failure of the primary gateway server.<br>
Once a failure of the primary gateway server has been detected, a number of different methods of selecting a new primary gateway server from the failover servers may be employed. The server may be selected based on name or through a mathematical operation performed on a server identifier. Alternatively, the selection may be based on the server processing attributes (speed, memory, etc.) or the next primary gateway server may have been previously designated by a system administrator. Other possibilities will occur to those skilled in the art.<br>
Figure 6 depicts a sequence of steps followed by the present invention to handle primary gateway failures. The sequence begins with the primary and failover gateway servers being designated (step 500). The designation of the failover servers activates the filters on the network stack of those servers and disables the NAT tables. When a remote session is established, the IP address assigned to the client is forwarded to the failover servers.  The primary gateway server is then queried to determine its health (step 502). If the primary gateway server is determined to be healthy (step 503), the query is repeated at set intervals. If the primary gateway server is not healthy (step 503),<br><br>
the new primary gateway server is selected from among the failover servers and its attributes changed so that its filter is disabled, it handles communications to and from the client IP and the NAT table on the server is activated (step 504).<br>
