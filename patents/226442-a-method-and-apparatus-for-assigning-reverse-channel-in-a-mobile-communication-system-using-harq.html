				<td>APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR ASSIGNING CHANNEL IN A MOBILE<br>
COMMUNICATION SYSTEM USING HARQ<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to a channel assigning apparatus and<br>
method in a mobile communication system, and in particular, to an apparatus and<br>
method for assigning channels in a mobile communication system using HARQ (Hybrid<br>
Automatic Repeat reQuest).<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
Typically, mobile communication systems support voice service only or support<br>
both voice service and data service. CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) is a major<br>
example. An existing CDMA system supporting voice service only is based on the IS-95<br>
siandards. Growing user demands and the resultant development of mobile<br>
communication technology have driven mobile communication systems toward high-<br>
speed data service. CDMA2000 was proposed to support both voice service and high-<br>
speed data service.<br>
During data transmission/reception via a radio link, data may be damaged or<br>
rest in a mobile communication system. As a main real-time service, voice service<br>
experiences data damage or loss, and there is no need for retransmitting data. However,<br>
in the case of packet data service, a message is valid only when damaged or lost data is<br>
retransmitted Hence, communication systems for data transmission perform data<br>
retransmission in various ways.<br>
Retransmission schemes used in wireless communication systems include RLP<br>
(Radio Link Protocol) retransmission and HARQ. The RLP retransmission will first be<br>
described below.<br>
In the RLP retransmission scheme, upon generation of reception errors, the RLP<br>
layer of a base station (BS) notifies a mobile station (MS) of the errors via a signaling<br>
channel on the reverse link. The MS then retransmits the same packet data. The same<br>
thing applies to the forward link from the BS to the MS. A distinctive shortcoming of the<br><br>
KLP retransmission scheme is that a long time is taken between initial transmission of<br>
error-containing traffic data and its retransmission because the BS processes the packet<br>
data not in the physical layer but in the RLP layer or in its upper layer. Another<br>
shortcoming is that received data having errors cannot be reused. Therefore, it is<br>
preferable to minimize RLP retransmission in the typical communication system.<br>
In this context, HARQ is adopted as a more efficient retransmission method in<br>
the wireless communication system. The HARQ scheme can overcome the shortcomings<br>
of the RLP retransmission scheme. In the HARQ scheme, the physical layer detects<br>
errors and requests retransmission. When errors occur during transmission from a<br>
transmitter, the physical layer takes charge of retransmission. A receiver combines a<br>
previously received signal with a retransmitted signal, thereby correcting errors. That is,<br>
the HARQ scheme can solve the problem of a long error processing time encountered in<br>
tne RLP retransmission because the physical layer decides as to whether or not to<br>
retransmit data. Also, previously received packet data having errors can be reused.<br>
Even when the HARQ scheme is used, RLP retransmission maybe needed for<br>
some packets due to a limit on the number of retransmissions. The HARQ scheme<br>
reduces the number of RLP HARQ retransmissions by limiting the error rate of final<br>
combined data, namely a residual error rate to 0.01 or less. Therefore, the number of<br>
KLP retransmission occurrences is significantly reduced when using the HARQ scheme,<br>
rather than when not using the HARQ scheme.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described herein below<br>
with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following description, well-known<br>
functions or constructions are not described in detail since they would obscure the<br>
invention ir unnecessary detail.<br>
FIG. 1 is a view illustrating transmission/reception of reverse traffic data in a<br>
typical mobile communication system using a HARQ scheme.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, an R-PDCH (Reverse Packet Data Channel) is a traffic<br>
channel that delivers data from an MS to a BS, supporting the HARQ scheme. A HARQ<br>
scheme illustrated in FIG. 1 is implemented in a synchronous manner. Traffic<br>
information, an EP (Encoder Packet is retransmitted at predetermined intervals and up to<br>
three HARQ channels are available. The term "synchronous" means that an EP whose<br>
transmission starts in an ith time slot is retransmitted only in (i+3N)th time slots until it is<br>
completely received or completely fails. For example, if an EP is transmitted in the ith<br>
time slot, its first retransmission occurs in an (i+3)th time slot and its second<br>
retransmission occurs in an (i+6)th time slot. When three HARQ channels are available<br>
as illustrated in FIG. 1, they can be used respectively in (i+3N)l\ (i+3N+l)th, and<br>
(i+3N+2)th time slots. The three channels are denoted by HARQ CH1, HARQ CH2 and<br>
H ARQ CH3 If four HARQ channels are available, they can be used respectively in<br>
(i- 4N)th, (i+4N+l)lh, (i+4N+2)th , and (i+4N+3)th time slots.<br>
Retransmission using the three HARQ channels in the illustrated case of FIG. 1<br>
will be described. In FIG. 1, reference numerals 110, 120 and 130 denote first through<br>
third R-PDCHs, respectively. Reference numerals 110-1, 120-1 and 130-1 denote<br>
respective response channels for the first through third R-PDCHs.<br>
In reverse packet data transmission, an MS transmits a first subpacket for new<br>
traffic (i.e. ar EP) in the ith time slot on the first R-PDCH 110. This is called an initial<br><br>
assignment information (e.g. HARQ channel assignment information) 210 to the MS on<br>
an F-GCH (Forward Grant Channel). The HARQ channel assignment information 210<br>
contains a MAC (Medium Access Control) ID (Identifier) identifying the MS and an<br>
allowed maximum data rate or an allowed maximum TPR for the MS . A MAC ID<br>
identifies an MS that a BS services and thus each MS has a unique MAC ID. The reason<br>
for using an MS-specific MAC ID is that the F-GCH is transmitted to one MS each time.<br>
The BS indicates to an MS that the F-GCH is destined for, by the MAC ID of the MS.<br>
The allowed maximum data rate or TPR set in the F-GCH tells the MS how much<br>
system capacity is available to the MS.<br>
In the illustrated case of FIG. 2, one HARQ channel is assigned by the F-GCH<br>
to allocate reverse link system capacity. The MS, receiving the F-GCH for the R-<br>
REQCH transmitted in the ith time slot, starts to transmit reverse data on the HARQ<br>
channel in (i+3N)th time slots starting from an (i+3)th time slot of an assigned first R-<br>
PDCH 220 at or below the allowed maximum data rate or TPR. In this HARQ channel<br>
assignment, only one HARQ channel is available via the F-GCH. In other words, even<br>
alter receiving the F-GCH, the MS cannot occupy the same system capacity using a<br>
HARQ channel in an (i+3N+l)th time slot and an HARQ channel in an (i+3N+2)th time<br>
slot.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates assignment of reverse system capacity from a BS to an MS in<br>
another mobile communication system supporting the reverse HARQ scheme. The MS<br>
requests a particular data rate to the BS, and the BS notifies the MS of an allowed<br>
maximum data rate for three PDCHs as HARQ channels.<br>
As described before with reference to FIG. 2, the BS cannot assign the system<br>
capacity of a plurality of HARQ channels by one F-GCH transmission. Thus, as many F-<br>
GCH transmissions as the number of HARQ channels to be assigned occur to assign the<br>
system capacity of the HARQ channels. Referring to FIG. 3. the BS transmits the F-<br>
GCH three times as indicated by reference numerals 310, 320 and 330 to assign HARQ<br>
channels 340, 350 and 360. Transmissions of the HARQ channels 340, 350 and 360 are<br>
confined to (i+3N)th, (i+3N+l)th, and (i+3N+2)th time slots, respectively.<br>
The transmissions of the F-GCH to assign the reverse capacity of a plurality of<br>
HARQ channels as illustrated in FIG. 3 increases forward F-GCH interference. In the<br><br>
case where one MS occupies the F-GCH as described above, the F-GCH cannot be<br>
transmitted for other MSs in the same time slot. This is because the number of F-GCHs<br>
available in the same time slot is usually limited.<br>
FIG. 4 illustrates a HARQ operation in an MS according to an embodiment of<br>
the present invention. The embodiment of the present invention is characterized in that a<br>
BS assigns the reverse system capacity of a plurality of HARQ channels to the MS by<br>
one F-GCH transmission.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, the MS transmits a request message 400 to the BS in an ilh<br>
time slot on an R-REQCH, requesting assignment of reverse system capacity. The BS<br>
then generates channel assignment information (i.e. HARQ channel assignment<br>
information) 410 to grant reverse transmission of packet data to the MS and transmits it<br>
10 the MS on an F-GCH. The HARQ channel assignment information 410 further<br>
contains additional information, compared to the conventional channel assignment<br>
information on the F-GCH in the cases illustrated in FIGs. 2 and 3.<br>
The HARQ channel assignment information 410 transmitted on the F-GCH<br>
includes "multiple HARQ channel assignment" in addition to the channel assignment<br>
information on the F-GCH, that is, a MAC ID and an allowed maximum data rate or<br>
TPR. The "multiple HARQ channel assignment" indicates which HARQ channel or<br>
channels are assigned to the MS among a plurality of available HARQ channels. For<br>
example, if three HARQ channels 420, 430 and 440 are available at the same time as<br>
illustrated in FIG. 4, the "multiple HARQ channel assignment" tells the MS how many<br>
HARQ channels and what HARQ channels are assigned to it.<br>
Table 1 below lists the values of "multiple HARQ channel assignment" and<br>
their meanings when three HARQ channels are available at the same time as illustrated<br>
in HG. 4.<br><br><br><br>
In Table 1, HARQ CH1 is the earliest of the three HARQ channels that can be<br>
assigned by the F-GCH. HARQ CH1 is the first R-PDCH 420. HARQ CH2 is the<br>
second earliest HARQ channel 430 that can be assigned by the F-GCH, and HARQ CH3<br>
is the last HARQ channel 440 that can be assigned by the F-GCH. When receiving the F-<br>
GCH, the MS establishes HARQ CH1, HARQ CH2 and HARQ CH3 in the (i+3)th,<br>
(i+4)th, and (i+5)th time slots, respectively.<br>
Table 2 below lists the values of "multiple HARQ channel assignment" and<br>
their meanings when four HARQ channels are available at the same time.<br><br>
Referring to Table 2, HARQ CH1 is the earliest of the four HARQ channels that<br>
can be assigned by the F-GCH. HARQ CH2 and HARQ CH3 are the second and third<br>
HARQ channels, respectively, and HARQ CH4 is the last HARQ channel that can be<br>
assigned by the F-GCH.<br>
FIG. 5 is a block diagram an embodiment of a transmitter for transmitting a<br><br>
multiple HARQ channel assignment sequence on the F-GCH according to the present<br>
invention With reference to FIG. 5, the configuration and operation of the transmitter<br>
will be described below.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, HARQ channel assignment information transmitted on the<br>
F-GCH contains an 8-bit MAC ID, a 4-bit allowed maximum data rate or TPR, and a 2-<br>
bit multiple HARQ channel assignment. The HARQ channel assignment information is<br>
asually output from a scheduler or controller (not shown in FIG. 5) of the BS. In the<br>
illustrated case of FIG. 5, up to three HARQ channels are available at the same time and<br>
assigned via the F-GCH.<br>
A CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Code) encoder 501 attaches an 8-bit CRC to the<br>
14-bit HARQ channel assignment information, for detection of transmission errors. A<br>
tail encoder 502 attaches 8 tail bits to the 22 information bits received from the CRC<br>
encoder 501, for efficient decoding of a convolutional code with K=9. The resulting 30<br>
information bits are provided to a convolutional encoder 503. In the embodiment of the<br>
present invention, a coding rate of 1/4 (R=l/4) is used in the convolutional encoder 503,<br>
by way of example. The convolutional encoder 503 encodes the 30 information bits to<br>
120 code symbols. The code symbols occur twice in a sequence repeater 504. Therefore,<br>
the output of the sequence repeater 504 is 240 code symbols. A puncturer 505 punctures<br>
48 symbols in the 240 code symbols, that is, 1 symbol out of every 5 symbols and<br>
outputs 192 symbols. A block interleaver 506 block-interleaves the 192 symbols. A<br>
modulator, for example, a QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying) modulator 507<br>
modulates the 192 symbols to 96 modulation symbols. An orthogonal spreader 508<br>
spreads the 96 modulation symbols with an orthogonal code of length 128. The spread<br>
signal is then transmitted on a radio channel. Here, a component of reference numerals<br>
501 to 508 denotes transmitter.<br>
In this HARQ channel assignment scheme, the BS can assign one or more<br>
HARQ channels at one time as illustrated in FIG. 4, with reference to Table 1 and Table<br>
2. Alternativery, the HARQ channels can be assigned through two or more F-GCH<br>
transmissions, as illustrated in FIG. 6.<br>
FIG. 6 illustrates assignment of one or more R-PDCHs to the MS by two F-<br>
GCH transmissions according to another embodiment of the present invention.<br><br>
Referring to FIG. 6. the MS transmits a request message 600 to the BS,<br>
requesting assignment of reverse system capacity. The BS then assigns HARQ channels<br>
to the MS by transmitting the F-GCH twice. First HARQ assignment information 611 of<br>
me F-GCH assigns HARQ CH1 and HARQ CH3. According to Table 2, the BS sets<br>
' multiple HARQ assignment" to 010. Second HARQ assignment information 612 of the<br>
1 -GCH assigns HARQ CH2. Thus, the BS sets "multiple HARQ assignment" to 000<br>
because HARQ CH2 is the earliest HARQ channel that can be assigned by the second<br>
HARQ assignment information 612. Upon receipt of the HARQ assignment information<br>
611 and the HARQ assignment information 612, the MS establishes HARQ channels<br>
6 20, 630 and 640.<br>
FIG 7 illustrates a HARQ operation in the MS according to a third embodiment<br>
of the present invention. In FIG. 7, the BS assigns the reverse system capacity of three<br>
reverse HARQ channels to the MS by one F-GCH transmission. When the MS needs to<br>
retransmit packet data, it utilizes as much of the assigned system capacity as possible.<br>
Referring to FIG. 7, upon receipt of a request message 700 requesting<br>
assignment of a reverse link on an R-REQCH from the MS. the BS transmits to the MS<br>
HARQ channel assignment information 710 on the F-GCH, for assigning the reverse<br>
system capacity of three HARQ channels HARQ CH1 720, HARQ CH2 730, and<br>
HARQ CH3 740. It is assumed herein that the BS allows a maximum data rate of<br>
15 3.6kbps for the three HARQ channels 720. 730 and 740. After receiving the F-GCH,<br>
the MS is capable of transmitting data at 153.6kbps on each of HARQ CH1, HARQ<br>
CH2 and HARQ CH3. The MS can transmit reverse data at a default data rate, for<br>
example, 38.4kbps, while requesting the R-PDCHs via the R-REQCH. Hence, the MS.<br>
while requesting assignment of a reverse data rate on the R-REQCH, transmits first data<br>
711 on HARQ CH1 corresponding to a first R-PDCH, second data 712 on HARQ CH2<br>
corresponding to a second R-PDCH, and third data 713 on HARQ CH3 corresponding to<br>
a third R-PDCH. The reverse channels and data rate assigned by the BS can be used first<br>
in a (i+3)th time slot after the data transmission at the default data rate. That is. after<br>
receiving the HARQ channel assignment information 710, the MS starts to operate in the<br>
(i+ 3)th time slot as indicated by the HARQ assignment information.<br>
The BS successfully receives the initially transmitted packet data 711 at<br>
38.4kbps in an ith time slot, but fails to receive the initially transmitted packet data 712<br><br>
and 713 at 38.3kbps in (i+l)th and (i+2)th time slots.<br>
The BS assigns the reverse system capacity to the MS such that reverse<br>
transmission can start at 153.6kbps in the (i+3)th time slot. However, despite the<br>
assignment of 153.6kbps, the MS cannot transmit data at 153.6kbps in (i+4)th and (i+5)th<br>
lime slots because the same data is supposed to be retransmitted at the same data rate.<br>
Hence, the MS retransmits the initially transmitted data at 38.4kbps. Data retransmission<br>
as carried out on the second R-PDCH 730 and the third R-PDCH 740 according to the<br>
present invention. In the case where data is retransmitted at a data rate lower than the<br>
allowed maximum data rate set in the F-GCH, the MS retransmits subpackets with a<br>
boosted TPR in the (i+4)lh time slot on the second R-PDCH 730 and in the (i+5)th time<br>
slot on the third R-PDCH 740. The TPR is a ratio of the transmit power of an R-PDCH<br>
to that of a reverse pilot channel. It is preset for each data rate as illustrated in Table 3.<br><br>
In the (i+4)th and (i+5)th time slots, the data is retransmitted at 38.4kbps with a<br>
TPR of 7dB corresponding to 153.6kbps, instead of 3.75dB corresponding to 38.4kbps.<br>
The TPR boosting is done for the purpose of allowing the MS to maximize the use of the<br>
assigned system capacity and thus increasing the reception probability of the<br>
retransmitted packets in the BS. With the data retransmission with the boosted TPR, the<br>
number of transmissions required for the BS to receive the EPs without errors is reduced.<br>
FIG. 8 is a flowchart illustrating a control operation for boosting a TPR for data<br>
retransmission in the MS that has received HARQ channel assignment information on<br>
the F-GCH according to the third embodiment of the present invention.<br><br>
Referring to FIG. 8. after requesting reverse channel assignment on the R-<br>
REQCH, the MS monitors HARQ channel assignment information on the F-GCH in<br>
every time slot in step 801. In step 802, the MS determines whether the F-GCH<br>
information is destined for the MS. If it is, the MS proceeds to step 803 and if it is not<br>
the MS proceeds to step 806. The determination is made by comparing a MAC ID set in<br>
the HARQ channel assignment information with the MAC ID of the MS.<br>
In step 806, the MS establishes an R-PDCH in an autonomous mode and<br>
transmits reverse packet data on the R-PDCH. The autonomous mode refers to a mode<br>
vhere the MS chooses one of autonomous mode data rates pre-assigned by the BS and<br>
transmits packet data at the chosen data rate on an R-PDCH. In general, a data rate<br>
available tc the MS in the autonomous mode is lower than that assigned by the BS via<br>
the F-GCH. Yet, the autonomous mode data rate is not always lower than the data rate<br>
as signed by the F-GCH.<br>
Meanwhile, when the MS proceeds from step 802 to step 803. which implies<br>
that the F-Gt.H delivers HARQ channel assignment information for the MS, it controls<br>
its data rate. As described above with reference to FIG. 7, the packet data has already<br>
been transmitted before a reverse channel is assigned for packet data transmission.<br>
Therefore, the MS determines whether a retransmission is needed for the previous<br>
packet data transmitted before the R-PDCH assignment in step 803.<br>
If the previous packet data is to be retransmitted like the retransmission of the<br>
data transmitted before F-GCH reception in the (i+4)th and (i+5)th time slots in FIG. 7.<br>
the MS proceeds to step 804. If the retransmission is not required, the MS determines a<br>
data rate according to the F-GCH information and sets a TPR for the determined data<br>
rate referring to Table 3 in step 807. The TPRs of Table 3 are predetermined and stored<br>
in the MS. Alternatively, they are determined by agreement between the BS and the MS<br>
before packet data transmission and stored in the MS.<br>
In step 804, the MS compares the data rate of the packet data to be<br>
retransmitted with an allowed maximum data rate set in the F-GCH information. If the<br>
data rate of the packet data selected in the autonomous mode is lower than the maximum<br>
data rate, the MS proceeds to step 805. If the data rate of the packet data is equal to or<br>
higher than the maximum data rate, the MS proceeds to step 808.<br><br>
In step 805, the MS boosts the TPR for data retransmission, as described with<br>
reference to FIG 7. Meanwhile, the MS retransmits the packet data without boosting the<br>
TPR, that is. with the preset TPR corresponding to the data rate of the packet data in step<br>
808. If the data rate selected in the autonomous mode is higher than the F-GCH-assigned<br>
data rate, the data retransmission can be carried out by TPR dropping, that is, using the<br>
TPR of the F-GCH-assigned data rate.<br>
FIG. 9 illustrates a HARQ operation along with control of a data rate in the MS<br>
according io a fourth embodiment of the present invention. In FIG. 9, the BS assigns the<br>
reverse system capacity of three reverse HARQ channels to the MS by one F-GCH<br>
transmission. Besides the F-GCH, the BS provides an additional fine control to the<br>
reverse system capacity using an RCB (Rate Control Bit) of an F-RCCH (Forward Rate<br>
(control CHannel).<br>
Referring to FIG. 9, the MS transmits a request message 900 to the BS on the R-<br>
REQCH, requesting reverse data transmission. At the same time, the MS transmits<br>
reverse packet data 911,912 and 913 as agreed beforehand between the BS and the MS.<br>
Upon receipt of the request message 900, the BS checks whether R-PDCHs are available<br>
to the MS. If they are available, the BS determines reverse capacity to assign to the MS<br>
and transmits HARQ channel assignment information 901 to the MS on the F-GCH. In<br>
the illustrated case of FIG. 9, three HARQ channels, HARQ CH1, HARQ CH2 and<br>
HARQ CH3 are assigned at 153.6kbps to the MS. These HARQ channels are assigned in<br>
the manner illustrated in FIG. 7. Yet, FIG. 9 differs from FIG 7 in that the BS controls<br>
the reverse system capacity assigned to the MS via the F-RCCH as well as the F-GCH.<br>
"Now. a method of controlling reverse system capacity via the F-RCCH will be<br>
described. In HG. 9, the BS assigns the reverse system capacity of three HARQ channels<br>
to the MS via the F-GCH. More specifically, the BS assigns a maximum data rate of<br>
153.6kbps for data transmission starting from (i+3)th, (i+4)th and (i+5)th time slots. The<br>
BS then additionally transmits the F-RCCH to the MS in order to provide a fine control<br>
to the reverse system capacity assigned in the (i+4)th and (i+5)th time slots. That is, after<br>
being, assigned the system capacity via the F-GCH, the MS establishes first through third<br>
R-PDCHs 920, 930 and 940. The first R-PDCH 920 is maintained at a maximum data<br>
rate et in the F-GCH information, whereas the data rates of the second and third R-<br>
PDCHs 930 and 940 are controlled via the F-RCCH. The BS transmits a 1-bit RCB to<br><br>
the MS on the F-RCCH in each time slot. If the RGB is "+1", the MS increases the data<br>
rate of the second R-PDCH 930 to be higher than that of the first R-PDCH 920. Thus,<br>
the second R-PDCH 930 delivers packet data at 307.2kbps. Shortly after transmitting the<br>
RCB of +1, the BS transmits an RCB of -1 to the MS. Since the data rate of the first<br>
PDCH 920 is assigned by the F-GCH, the MS decides the data rate of the third R-PDCH<br>
940 relative to the data rate of the first PDCH 920. Here, the RCB of-1 indicates a data<br>
rate decrease for the third PDCH 940. Thus, the MS transmits packet data on the third R-<br>
PDCh 940 at 76.8kbps. If the RCB is not received on the F-RCCH, this implies that the<br>
data rate of the second or third R-PDCH 930 or 940 is to be maintained at that of the<br>
first R-PDCH 920.<br>
When the BS transmits the F-RCCH in the manner illustrated in FIG. 9, the MS<br>
operates as follows. The BS assigns HARQ CH1, HARQ CH2 and HARQ CH3 at<br>
153.6kbps to the MS. The MS then determines that reverse system capacity has been<br>
assigned at 153.6kbps by HARQ CH1 in the (i+3)th time slot. Regarding HARQ CH2<br>
and HARQ CH3, the MS calculates its assigned reverse system capacity based on<br>
153.6kbps set in the F-GCH and an RCB set in the F-RCCH. For example, the MS<br>
determines 307.2kbps as its assigned reverse system capacity for HARQ CH2 in the<br>
(i+4)n time slot because the F-GCH indicates 153.6kbps but the RCB of the F-RCCH is<br>
"+1" indicating a rate increase. Also, the MS determines 76.8kbps as its assigned reverse<br>
system capacity for HARQ CH3 in the (i+5)th time slot because the F-GCH indicates<br>
153.6kbps but the RCB of the F-RCCH is "-1" indicating a rate decrease. In the above<br>
case, one increment and one decrement of 153.6kbps are assumed to be 307.2kbps and<br>
76.8kbps, respectively, based on Table 3.<br>
The fine control of the reverse system capacity via the F-RCCH illustrated in<br>
FIG 9 is applicable when the BS assigns a plurality of HARQ channels via the F-GCH.<br>
In this case, the BS transmits the F-RCCH for the remaining HARQ channels except for<br>
the earliest HARQ channel which can be assigned by the F-GCH among a plurality of<br>
assigned HARQ channels, thereby controlling the system capacity of the remaining<br>
HARQ channels. In FIG. 9, the BS provides an additional fine control to HARQ CH2<br>
and HARQ CH3 via the F-RCCH, except HARQ CH1 in the (i+3)th time slot, the earliest<br>
HARQ channel to which the F-GCH is applicable. For the additional fine control, the<br>
data rate set in the F-GCH is a reference data rate.<br><br>
While the BS assigns an allowed maximum data rate to the MS via the F-GCH,<br>
the above method is performed in the same manner although an allowed maximum TPR<br>
is set in he F-GCH instead of the maximum data rate. If a maximum TPR is set in the 1-<br>
GCH in FIG. 9, the F-RCCH is so configured as to indicate TPR boosting/dropping,<br>
instead of rate up/down.<br>
FIG. 10 illustrates HARQ operations in MSs according to a fourth embodiment<br>
of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 10, the BS transmits HARQ channel assignment information<br>
1001 and 1011 to two MSs, MS1 and MS2 via the F-GCH, respectively. Upon receipt of<br>
the HARQ channel assignment information 1001, MS1 transmits packet data 1020 at a<br>
data rate set in the received information 1001. Upon receipt of the HARQ channel<br>
assignment information 1011, MS2 transmits packet data 1030 at a data rate set in the<br>
eceived information 1011. While the HARQ channel assignment information 1001 and<br>
the HARQ channel assignment information 1011 commonly assign reverse system<br>
capacity to MS1 and MS2, they have different assignment contents. The destination of<br>
HARQ channel assignment information on the F-GCH is identified by a MAC ID set<br>
therein.<br>
In FIG. 10, the BS assigns one R-PDCH at 153.6kbps to MS1 via the F-GCH.<br>
Thus, MS1 transmits only one packet at 153.6kbps after receiving the F-GCH and<br>
performs additional data transmission on the HARQ channel in the autonomous mode.<br>
MS1 cannot additionally transmit data on another HARQ channel at 153.6kbps until it<br>
receives the F-GCH one more time. That is, MS1 transmits the packet data on the first<br>
R PDCH. Upon request for a retransmission of the packet data 1020, the MS transmits<br>
retransmission packet data 1020-1 for the initially transmitted packet data 1020 on the<br>
first R-PDCH.<br>
As stated before, the BS also transmits the FIARQ channel assignment<br>
information 1011 that assigns 153.6kbps to MS2. Notably, the data rate of MS2 is further<br>
controlled. The BS allows MS2 to start to transmit packet data at 153.6kbps via the F-<br>
GCH and controls the data rate for data transmission starting with the second EP on the<br>
HARQ channel by an RCB of the F-RCCH. After receiving the HARQ channel<br>
assignment information 1011, MS2 recognizes that the first EP is supposed to be<br><br>
transmitted at an allowed maximum data rate set in the F-GCH information 1011.<br>
1 hus. MS2 transmits the packet data 1030 at 153.6kbps set in the F-GCH in the<br>
(i+3)th time slot. When the BS fails to receive the packet data 1030, MS2 transmits<br>
retransmission packet data 1030-1 for the data 1030 in an (i+6)th time slot. The BS then<br>
controls the data rate of MS2 for the next packet data 1031 to be transmitted on the<br>
HARQ channel by an RCB of the F-RCCH. Thus, the BS transmits the RCB set to +1 to<br>
MS2. Then MS2 increases its data rate to 307.2kbps in an (i+9)th time slot.<br>
To allow an MS to transmit only one packet data and to allow another MS to<br>
ransmit one packet data and then adjust its data rate based on the RCB of the F-RCCH,<br>
the BS transmits HARQ channel assignment information to the first and second MSs in<br>
different F-GCH messages. To do so, the HARQ channel assignment information is<br>
configured to further have "multiple EP assignment'". The values of "multiple EP<br>
assignment" and their meanings are tabulated in Table 4 below.<br><br>
By further including 1-bit "multiple EP assignment" illustrated in Table 4 in the<br>
HARQ channel assignment information, the BS allows the MS to adjust its data rate<br>
based on the RCB, change the data rate to a fixed value by the F-GCH, or controls the<br>
data rate in the autonomous mode.<br><br>
FIG. II is a block diagram of another embodiment of the transmitter for<br>
transmitting HARQ channel assignment information on the F-GCH.<br>
Referring to FIG. 11, the HARQ channel assignment information transmitted on<br>
the F-GCH contains an 8-bit MAC ID, a 4-bit allowed maximum data rate or TPR, a 2-<br>
bit multiple HARQ channel assignment, and a 1-bit multiple EP assignment. The F-GCH<br>
delivers the HARQ channel assignment information to assign up to three available<br>
HARQ channels.<br>
A CRC encoder 1101 attaches an 8-bit CRC to the 15-bit F-GCH information,<br>
for detection of transmission errors. A tail encoder 1102 attaches 8 tail bits to the 23<br>
information bits received from the CRC encoder 1101, for efficient decoding of a<br>
convolutional code with K=9. The resulting 31 information bits are provided to a<br>
convolufional encoder 1103. In the embodiment of the present invention, a coding rate of<br>
1/4 (R= 1/4) is used in the convolutional encoder 1103, by way of example. The<br>
convolutional encoder 1103 encodes the 31 information bits to 124 code symbols. The<br>
code symbols occur twice in a sequence repeater 1104. Therefore, the output of the<br>
sequence repeater 1104 is 248 code symbols. A puncturer 1105 punctures 56 symbols in<br>
the 248 code symbols, specifically punctures 1 symbol out of every 4 symbols and<br>
outputs 192 symbols. A block interleaver 1106 block-interleaves the 192 symbols. A<br>
modulator, for example, a QPSK modulator 1107 modulates the 192 symbols to 96<br>
modulation symbols. An orthogonal spreader 1108 spreads each of the 96 modulation<br>
symbols with an orthogonal code of length 128. The spread signal is then transmitted on<br>
a radio channel.<br>
As described above, the present invention advantageously assigns HARQ<br>
channels last, reduces forward interference involved in the HARQ channel assignment,<br>
and increases the use efficiency of the F-GCH in a mobile communication system<br>
supporting the HARQ scheme.<br>
While the invention has been shown and described with reference to certain<br>
