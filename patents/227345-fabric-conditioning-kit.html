COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10 and Rule 13)<br>
FABRIC CONDITIONING KIT<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br>
WO 2005/063959<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/013556<br><br>
Fabric Conditioning Kit<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
5  The present invention relates to a kit for rinsing fabrics, a rinse conditioning system, a method of preparing a dispersion and the use of a permeable article to prepare a dispersion.<br>
10  Background of the Invention and. Prior Art<br>
     Fabric conditioning compositions for use in the laundry are typically added to the laundry process after the washing stage. Where the laundry process involves an automatic <br>
15  washing machine, the conditioning composition may need to be dosed either directly into the drum or via a dispensing tray.  For hand-wash processes, the composition will be dosed into the hand-wash liquor.<br>
20  Independent of the type of process, the fabric conditioning composition must firstly be sufficiently dispersed into the rinse liquor so that it can act on the fabrics being laundered.<br>
25  If the composition is inadequately dispersed, there is a<br>
significant risk that it will not be deposited evenly on the fabric but will instead deposit at excessive concentrations on small portions thereof which in turn may lead to spotting or staining.  There is also the risk that the ingredients<br>
30  within the composition may not deposit at all and will<br><br>
WO 2005/063959<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/013556<br><br>
-  2   -<br>
instead remain in an undispersed state within the rinse liquor.<br>
This is clearly undesirable to consumers. 5<br>
    Dispersion of the composition may often not be fully complete before the composition is contacted with the fabrics to be treated.  In the dispensing drawer of an automatic washing machine, this can manifest itself as a <br>
10  build up of a gel-like residue requiring the consumer to carry out additional undesirable cleaning of the drawer.<br>
Dispersion thus remains problematic for fabric conditioning compositions.<br>
15<br>
Various ways of addressing this problem have been found including placing a dosed amount of the fabric conditioning composition into a container, adding water and shaking or mixing to form a pre-dispersion which can then be added to<br>
20   the laundry cycle so as to disperse therein more easily. The drawback with this approach is that the consumer is burdoned with additional undesirable tasks and will typically be required to prepare such a pre-dispersion in advance of the laundry cycle.<br>
25<br>
It is thus  remains  desirable to provide a means  for dispersing fabric  conditioning compositions.<br>
Articles  such as  sponges  are  known for use with personal<br>
 30      washing products.<br><br>

15  Typically, in the prior art, washing implements as described above find their greatest utility in combination with a liquid cleanser, since there is a need with liquid cleansers for the consumers to have an implement to grasp and with which to generate lather.<br>
20<br>
Often, the liquid cleanser includes a moisturising ingredient in addition to a surfactant.  The desire for an implement to generate lather in a washing system including a moisturising cleansing composition is often foremost within<br>
25  the contemplation of a consumer.  Such a desire is mentioned in, for instance, WO 95/00116.<br>
     By contrast, it has been long established that, for rinse conditioning products such as fabric softening compositions, <br>
30  foaming is considered undesirable by consumers since foaming<br><br>
WO 2005/063959<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/013556<br><br>
-  6  -<br>
is associated only with a washing rather than a rinse conditioning step.<br>
Thus it is important to avoid foaming of the rinse 5  conditioning composition.<br>
Objects of the Invention<br>
   The present invention seeks, to address one or more of the <br>
10    abovementioned problems and/or to provide one or more of the abovementioned benefits.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that a permeable, preferably porous article provides an excellent dispersing <br>
15   means for fabric conditioning compositions.<br>
Statement of Invention<br>
Thus, according to the present invention there is provided a 20  system for conditioning fabrics comprising a fabric<br>
conditioning composition in combination with a permeable article for improving dispersion of the composition in a liquid.<br>
25  The invention further provides a kit for conditioning fabric comprising a fabric conditioning composition in combination with a permeable article for improving dispersion of the composition in a liquid.<br>
30  According to a further aspect, the invention provides a<br>
package comprising a permeable, preferably porous article, a<br><br>
WO 2005/063959<br><br>
PCT7EP2004/013556<br><br>
-  7   -<br>
fabric conditioning composition and instructions to disperse the composition in a liquid, preferably water, using the permeable article.<br>
5  The invention also provides the use of a permeable,<br>
preferably porous article to disperse a fabric conditioning composition in a liquid, preferably water.<br>
According to yet another aspect, the invention provides a <br>
10   method of dispersing a fabric conditioning ccrposition in a liquid, preferably water, by introducing the composition onto or into the permeable, preferably porous article, submersing the article in the liquid and agitating the article so as to assist dispersion of the co-position. <br>
15<br>
The invention still further provides a method of conditioning fabrics comprising dispersing a fabric conditioning composition in a liquid, preferably water, with the aid of a permeable, preferably porous article and then<br>
20  contacting the dispersed composition with fabrics to be treated.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
25   In the context of the present invention, the term "comprising" denotes that the feature (s) to which it refers is/are not exhaustive and further features may be present<br>
Permeable Article<br>
30<br>
The system of the invention comprises a permeaoie article.<br><br>
WO 2005/063959<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/013556<br><br>
-  8   -<br>
Preferably the article is porous and/or absorbent.  More preferably the article is a sponge or meshed article.<br>
5  It is preferred that the article is compressible and it is particularly preferred that the article is resilient.<br>
    Although the invention works with permeable/porous articles which have little or no compressibility and/or resilience, <br>
10  it has been found that better dispersion can be achieved when the article is particularly compressible and/or flexible.<br>
     It is believed that this is due to the article having <br>
15  greater freedom of relative movement between different parts and/or surfaces of the article enabling a greater shearing action to occur within the article and thus better dispersion to be achieved.<br>
20  The average diameter of the uncompressed article is<br>
typically from 2cm to 20cm, more preferably from 3cm to 15cm, most preferably from 4cm to 10cm.<br>
The article can be prepared from readily available raw 25  materials or with specially designed mesh materials.<br>
    A suitable meshed article is preferably prepared from extruded tubular netting mesh which has been prepared from special strong and flexible polymeric material.  Extruded <br>
30  tubular netting mesh of this type, and particularly those<br><br>
WO 2005/063959<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/013556<br><br>
-   9   -<br>
prepared from polyethylene, have been used for the covering of meat and poultry and are readily available in industry.<br>
A polymeric meshed article preferably comprises a plurality <br>
5  of plys of an extruded tubular netting mesh prepared from a strong flexible polymer, preferably of the group consisting of addition polymers of olefin monomers, and polyamides of polycarboxylic acids and polyamines.  The plys of tubular netting mesh are typically folded upon itself numerous times <br>
10  to form a soft ball-like polymeric mesh sponge.<br>
Alternatively, the mesh can be formed by binding a piece of tubular mesh or a sheet of mesh about a centre-point with a piece of string, and then forming a series of random folds <br>
15  about this centre-point through various means of manipulation.<br>
In general the cross-sectional dimensions of each ply will be small in relation to the length of the ply. <br>
20<br>
The plys may be filaments.<br>
The ply may be elastomeric or non-elastomeric, but preferably the plys are elastomeric as this provides greater <br>
25  freedom of movement of plys relative to each other.<br>
Preferably use of a large plurality of tiny plys offer substantial gripping surface area.  Indeed, the user of the article will be enabled to thread his or her fingers through <br>
30  the plys.  While the use of plys that have a very small<br><br>
WO 2005/063959<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/013556<br><br>
-  10   -<br>
diameter as compared to ply length is envisioned primarily, the use of larger plys may also be advantageous.<br>
The article is preferably substantially spherical with a <br>
5  plurality of floppy filaments radiating in a dense, bushy manner from a central core region.  Generally, the plys will radiate outwardly in plural offset planes.<br>
 The preferably open cell structure of the mesh <br>
10   advantageously forms a structure which is highly resilient,        resulting in a puff which retains its shape throughout use.<br>
In general, the diameter for the filaments will range from 0.25 to 3mm, preferably from 0.75 to 1.5mm.  By "diameter"<br>
15  in this context is meant the maximum width or thickness in<br>
the case of a ribbon-like structure or the like, or the true diameter in the case of a rod-like structure.  In general, the length of the filaments is preferably from 1cm to 10cm, especially from 2 to 5cm for non-crimped filaments and from<br>
20   2 to 15cm, especially from 5 to 12cm for crimped filaments (measured with the filament straightened).  Although the preferred shape for the implement is spherical, other shapes such as a flattened oval, a football or a figure are contemplated.<br>
25<br>
The plys or filaments are preferably straight since this makes for a less "frilly" appearance, but they can also be curled or crimped.<br>
30  Although the polymeric material of which the meshed article is made may be inherently mildly abrasive, it preferably<br><br>
WO 2005/063959<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/013556<br><br>
-   11   -<br>
does not incorporate abrasive particles or a scouring material.<br>
Thus, abrasives such as pumice, aluminium oxide, volcanic <br>
5  ash, and silica are preferably omitted.  Likewise, the<br>
meshed article should not be ammonia- or oxygen- releasing and preferably does not include bleaching materials.<br>
     A suitable sponge is an open-cell sponge which possesses an <br>
10  interconnected cell structure permitting limited absorption and circulation of gases and fluids.  Outer surface of the material may be continuous or porous and exhibits good physical durability.  Because air can pass freely between its cells, sponge offers a high degree of compressibility <br>
15   and displays fast recovery upon release from compression.<br>
     Examples of suitable sponges include both natural sponges such as sea sponges, e.g. silk, sea wool and yellow sponges and synthetic sponges, such as synthetic cellulosic sponges. <br>
20<br>
The system of the invention excludes "personal washing" compositions, that is compositions designed specifically for washing of the skin of human beings.<br>
25  The system of the invention comprises the permeable article in combination with a fabric conditioning composition.<br><br>

Two netting tubes at 60 cm length each can be used to make a 7cm ball sponge.  They can be bundled manually with a loop or rope to form a ball-like polymeric mesh sponge.  Other designs such as rectangular gloves and washings implements <br>
  5    made with the mesh material also work very well in the  present invention system.<br>
Fabric Conditioning Composition<br>
10  Cationic Fabric Softener<br>
The fabric conditioning composition will typically comprises a cationic softening material.  The cationic softener is preferably a quaternary ammonium fabric softening material.<br>
15<br>
Particularly preferred quaternary ammonium fabric softening materials comprise two C12-28 alkyl or alkenyl groups connected to the nitrogen head group, preferably via at least one ester link.  It is more preferred if the<br>
20  quaternary ammonium material has two ester links present.<br>
Preferably, the average chain length of the alkyl or alkenyl group is at least C14, more preferably at least C16.     Most<br>
preferably at least half of the chains have a length of Cis-25<br>
It is generally preferred if the alkyl or alkenyl chains are predominantly linear, although a degree of branching, especially mid-chain branching, is within the scope of the invention.<br><br>
