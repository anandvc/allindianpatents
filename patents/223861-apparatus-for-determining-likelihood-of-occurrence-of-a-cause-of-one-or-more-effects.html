				<td>This invention relates to an apparatus and method for assisting in diagnosing cause<br>
and effect in many different circumstances throughout various different disciplines.<br>
In recent times, various disciplines, including the manufacturing industry and at least<br>
some branches of the medical field, have come under increasing pressure to increase<br>
yield, productivity and profits (or reduce costs or overheads). As such, there is an<br>
increasing need to reduce costs and reach the required result as quickly as possible,<br>
for example, in the manufacturing industry, the required result may be the<br>
manufacture of a batch of products which are all of optimum quality, and in a branch<br>
of the medical field, the required result might be the correct diagnosis of a complaint<br>
or disease in a patient (i.e. in both cases, to get it "right first time").<br>
In the case of the manufacturing industry, manufactured products are usually tested<br>
for quality, and sub-standard units are rejected. When a unit or set of units is rejected,<br>
the fault or faults are generally noted and it is highly desirable to establish the reason<br>
for the occurrence of the faults so that any problems can be rectified and the chances<br>
of manufacturing sub-standard products thereafter can be minimised. Such diagnosis<br>
is usually performed by experts in the field, who have acquired a fundamental<br>
understanding over the years of cause and effect relationships, which often influences<br>
the occurrence of rejected product units. Similarly, a patient will usually visit a<br>
general practitioner with one or more symptoms, from a description of which the<br>
doctor must try and diagnose the problem, based on current medical knowledge and<br>
his experience in the field. Thus, in general, cause and effect relationships are learned<br>
by experts in a particular field and applied in the diagnosis of problems when they<br>
occur in that field.<br>
However, this manual diagnosis procedure is time consuming and, therefore, increases<br>
costs and reduces productivity and yield. Further, when an expert leaves a particular<br>
place of employment, his expertise is also lost to the employer.<br>
Attempts have been made in the past to relate belief values, representing the strength<br>
of an effect, to a belief value which quantifies the extent of occurrence of an<br>
associated cause, using either multivariate regression analysis methods or neural<br>
network related methods. If the belief values in 'p' manifestations associated with a<br>
cause 'c' are represented by 'p' variables (as shown in Figure 1),<br>
then using the multivariate linear regression analysis method [1] or single layered feed<br>
forward neural network method [2], the belief value, which quantifies the extent of<br>
occurrence of cause 'c' is given by the following equation:<br><br>
where wJ, j = 0 to p are referred to as either regression coefficients (in a regression<br>
analysis context) or weights (in a neural network context). These coefficients, or<br>
weights, generally being considered as independent variables, are mostly determined<br>
using least square minimisation techniques. This is achieved by comparing the belief<br>
value in the cause calculated by equation (1) with a previously known value for the<br>
same inputs.<br>
Multi-layered feed forward neural network techniques, including radial basis<br>
functions [2], and also a range of methods proposed in the family of intrinsically<br>
linear, multivariate regression analysis [1], generalise equation (1) in the following<br>
way:<br>
Belief in cause = w0 + w1z1 + w2z2 + w3z3 +... + wizi +... + wmzm (2)<br>
where zi (i = 1 to m) represents a function of ?j (j = 1 to p)<br>
Different methods and apparatuses may use different functions (zi) ranging from<br>
simple linear polynomials to higher order, non-linear polynomials, logarithmic or<br>
exponential functions.<br>
Although, these methods have been employed to associate belief values in causes to<br>
belief values in effects, the methods have two major limitations:<br>
1. Physical interpretation can not be assigned to either weights wi or functions zi, as<br>
given in equation (2), which makes it very difficult to gain any physical insight<br>
into the cause and effect relationship.<br>
2. The number and the type of function used to define z. are not unique and are<br>
determined by a trial and error method.<br>
These limitations constrain the applicability of existing methods to relate belief<br>
values, which quantify the occurrence of a cause, with belief values representing<br>
strength of effects.<br>
The inventors have now devised an arrangement that overcomes the<br>
limitations/problems outlined above and seeks to provide a generic tool to relate belief<br>
values in causes and effects for use in many different fields, and industries, for<br>
diagnosing problems occurring therein.<br>
Thus, in accordance with the first aspect of the present invention, there is provided<br>
apparatus for determining a likelihood of occurrence of a cause of one or more effects,<br>
the apparatus comprising means for receiving and/or accessing training data relating<br>
to previously-identified relationships between one or more causes and one or more<br>
effect means, for defining one or more functions representative of said relationships,<br>
said functions) being in the form of polynomials which define quantified mappings<br>
between said one or more causes and one or more effects, each of said polynomials<br>
being associated with each of a plurality of respective reference points, at least some<br>
of which have a weight value assigned thereto, at least one of said weight values<br>
being an independent variable ("primary weight") and at least one of said weight<br>
values being dependent on one or more of said primary weights "(secondary weight"),<br>
and means for determining a likelihood of occurrence of one or more causes of one or<br>
more given effects using said mappings.<br>
Also in accordance with the first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a<br>
method of determining a likelihood of occurrence of a cause of one or more effects,<br>
the method comprising the steps of receiving and/or accessing quantifying data<br>
relating to previously-identified relationships between one or more causes and one or<br>
more effects, defining one or more functions representative of said relationships, said<br>
function(s) being in the form of polynomials which define quantified mappings<br>
between said one or more causes and one or more effects, each said polynomials<br>
being associated with each of a plurality of respective reference points, at least some<br>
of which have a weight value assigned thereto, at least one of said weight values<br>
being an independent variable ("primary weight") and at least one of said weight<br>
values being dependent on at least one of said primary weights ("secondary weight"),<br>
and determining a likelihood of occurrence of one or more causes of one or more<br>
given effects using said mappings.<br>
Thus, the present invention not only provides a method and apparatus for<br>
automatically providing diagnostic information relating to one or more likely causes<br>
of one or more given manifestations or effects, thereby reducing the input required by<br>
expert personnel once sufficient training data has been entered, where human input<br>
can otherwise be time consuming and is, of course, prone to error as it is generally<br>
based only on the opinion of very few experienced personnel; but also significantly<br>
reduces the number of independent weight values required to facilitate the diagnostic<br>
process, thereby reducing the quantity of training data required to a practical level<br>
when a large number of effects or manifestations of a cause are involved.<br>
The present invention provides a method and apparatus for calculating a belief value<br>
which quantifies the extent of occurrence of a cause, given belief values which<br>
quantify the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of associated affects of the cause.<br>
Examples of effects of a cause, which are indicative but certainly not exhaustive, are<br>
"symptoms" shown by patients in the medical domain, "defects" occurring in<br>
components in manufacturing industry or "effects" as generally meant in any "cause<br>
and effect" diagram.<br>
The belief value quantifying the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of an effect<br>
associated with a particular cause is preferably normalised between +1 to -1 or 1 to 0<br>
respectively. This belief value may also be interpreted as being the strength of the<br>
effect. The belief value, which quantifies the extent of occurrence of the cause under<br>
consideration, is preferably also normalised from zero to unity or -1 to +1 to represent<br>
non-occurrence and occurrence, respectively.<br>
The present invention also allows a meaningful physical interpretation to be assigned<br>
to each and every said weight value (primary and secondary weights) in the sense that<br>
a weight value at a position described by belief values, which represent the strength of<br>
associated manifestation, is nothing but the output value i.e. a belief value<br>
representing the extent of occurrence of the cause given the strengths of the associated<br>
effects.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the apparatus comprises a means<br>
of producing a multi-dimensional hyper-surface representing belief values in the<br>
occurrence /non-occurrence of a cause. The number of dimensions of the hyper-<br>
surface is equal to the number of input nodes representing the effects of a cause. The<br>
order of the hyper-surface along each dimension is determined by the order of the<br>
polynomial, preferably a Lagrange Interpolation Polynomial, used along the said<br>
dimension. The first order (or linear) Lagrange Interpolation Polynomial is defined by<br>
two reference points. Second order or quadratic Lagrange Interpolation Polynomials<br>
require three reference points. Similarly, an nth ordered Lagrange Interpolation<br>
Polynomial will require (n + l) reference points along the given dimension. The<br>
apparatus or method of calculating reference points including primary reference<br>
points and then associating a weight value along with the Lagrange Interpolation<br>
Polynomial at each reference point is described in more detail below.<br>
The training data is preferably made up of one or more training files, the or each file<br>
comprising an input vector, storing belief values representing strengths of all<br>
associated effects, and its corresponding desired output vector, storing belief values,<br>
which quantify the extent of occurrence of the corresponding cause.<br>
An embodiment of the present invention will now be described by way of example<br>
only, followed by sample numerical calculation and with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1A and 1B is a schematic illustration of a manifestation cause relationship;<br>
Figure 2 A to 2E are graphical representations of some general one-dimensional cause<br>
and effect relationships;<br>
Figure 3 is a schematic diagram illustrating a two effect - one cause relationship; and<br>
Figure 4 is a schematic diagram illustrating a two dimensional space describing ?1 and<br>
?2 axes.<br>
In order to facilitate the description of an exemplary embodiment of the present<br>
invention, a number of general one-dimensional cause and effect relationships<br>
associating belief values (based on the network illustrated in Figure 1B) will first be<br>
illustrated. Figures 2A-2E, show possible examples of the variation in belief values,<br>
representing the extent of occurrence of cause (output value), with respect to the<br>
belief values, representing the strength of one of the associated effect.<br>
Referring to Figure 2A of the drawings, a linear variation in belief values is shown, in<br>
which when the belief value representing the strength of effect is at its minimum, the<br>
belief value representing the extent of occurrence of the related cause is also at its<br>
minimum. As the strength of effect increases, the belief value in the occurrence of<br>
cause also linearly increases.<br>
Referring to Figure 2B of the drawings, a quadratic variation of cause and effect is<br>
shown in which when the belief value representing the strength of the effect is at its<br>
minimum, then the belief value in the occurrence of the related cause is also at its<br>
minimum. As the strength of the effect starts to increase, the belief value in the<br>
occurrence of the corresponding cause also starts to slowly increase. As the strength<br>
of the effect increases to about half of its maximum value, so the belief value in the<br>
occurrence of the cause suddenly increases and reaches its maximum value when the<br>
strength of the effect reaches its maximum value.<br>
Referring to Figure 2C of the drawings, a quadratic variation of cause and effect is<br>
shown which, when the belief value representing the strength of the effect is at its<br>
minimum, then the belief value in the occurrence of the related cause is also at its<br>
minimum. As the strength of the effect starts to increase, the belief value in the<br>
occurrence of the cause quickly starts to increase. When the strength of the effect is<br>
around half of its maximum value, the rate of increase in the belief value of the<br>
occurrence of the related cause slows down and reaches its maximum value when the<br>
strength of the effect also reaches its maximum value.<br>
Referring to Figure 2D of the drawings, a quadratic variation of cause and effect is<br>
shown in which when the belief value representing the strength of the effect is at its<br>
minimum, then the belief value in the occurrence of the related cause is at its<br>
maximum. As the strength of the effect starts to increase, there is a quick reduction in<br>
the belief value in the occurrence of the cause. As the strength of the effect increases<br>
to about half of its maximum value, the belief value in the occurrence of the cause<br>
slowly decreases and reaches its minimum value when the strength of the effect is at<br>
its maximum.<br>
Referring to Figure 2E of the drawings, a quadratic variation of cause and effect is<br>
shown in which when the belief value representing the strength of the effect is at its<br>
minimum, then the belief value in the occurrence of the related cause is at its<br>
maximum. As the strength of the effect starts increasing, the belief value in the<br>
occurrence of the cause slowly starts to decrease. When the strength of the effect<br>
reaches around half of its maximum value, the belief value in the occurrence of the<br>
cause starts to decrease quickly and reaches its minimum when the strength of the<br>
efffect is at its maximum.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a diagnostic arrangement, which not<br>
only "learns" from examples, but also quantifies the cause and effect relationship,<br>
which may be described in this exemplary embodiment of the invention by a decision<br>
hyper-surface constructed by combining Lagrange Interpolation Polynomials. Two<br>
reference points associated with two Lagrange Interpolation Polynomials and two<br>
weight values are required to describe a linear variation in the belief values as shown<br>
in Figure 2A. Similarly, three reference points along with three Lagrange<br>
Interpolation Polynomials and weight values are required to describe one dimensional<br>
quadratic belief variation as shown in Figures 2B-2E. The learning function of the<br>
apparatus is equivalent to finding a multi-dimensional hyper-surface, describing the<br>
said belief variation, which provides a best fit to the training data.<br>
Thus, an exemplary embodiment of the invention provides a method for calculating a<br>
belief value, which quantifies the extent of occurrence of a cause, given belief values,<br>
which quantify the occurrence or non-occurrence of associated effects of the cause.<br>
Examples of effects of a cause are, but not limited to, "symptoms" shown by patients<br>
in the medical domain, "defects" occurring in components in manufacturing industry<br>
or "effects" as generally meant in any "cause and effect" diagram. The belief value ?,<br>
which quantifies the occurrence or non-occurrence of an effect associated with a<br>
particular cause is normalised between +1 to -1 respectively. This belief value is also<br>
interpreted to represent the strength of the effect. The belief value, which quantifies<br>
the extent of occurrence of the cause under consideration is also normalised from zero<br>
to unity, to represent non-occurrence and occurrence of the said cause respectively.<br>
The relationship between the belief value, representing the strength of the effect, and<br>
the belief value, representing the extent of occurrence of the cause, is assumed to be<br>
either linear, quadratic, cubic and so on. The order of the relationship (e.g. one for<br>
linear, two for quadratic, three for cubic etc.) can either be given or calculated<br>
iteratively starting from one. To define an nthorder relationship along one-dimension,<br>
(n +1) reference points, equidistant between -1 to +1, are chosen. (If the location of<br>
the reference points is not equidistant, these reference points are mapped on to another<br>
set of equidistant reference points.) For each reference point 'i', a one dimensional<br>
Lagrange Interpolation Polynomial is constructed based on the following formula:<br><br>
where,<br>
n: order of the Lagrange Interpolation Polynomial (one for linear, two for<br>
quadratic, etc.)<br>
k. A reference point at which the one-dimensional Lagrange Interpolation<br>
Polynomial is constructed, it ranges from 0 to n.<br>
i: Ranges from one to total number of reference points i.e. (n +1).<br>
 are (n +1) equidistant reference points from with<br>
(n +1) corresponding Lagrange Interpolation Polynomials as given by equation (3).<br>
The variable ?, which stores the belief value representing the strength of the<br>
corresponding effect, ranges from -1 to +1. For a "single effect - cause relationship",<br>
the Lagrange Interpolation Polynomial is one-dimensional and the reference points<br>
are drawn along this dimension. If the number of associated manifestations for a given<br>
cause is 'p', the Lagrange Interpolation Polynomial at a reference point 'i' will be 'p'<br>
dimensional and is given by the following equation:<br><br>
nj: Order of one dimensional Lagrange Interpolation Polynomial<br>
corresponding to jth dimension that represents the relationship<br>
between jth manifestation and the cause under consideration.<br>
kj: Reference point along jth dimension, at which the one dimensional<br>
Lagrange Interpolation Polynomial is evaluated, (kj ranges<br>
from 0 to nj.)<br>
 reference points along the jth dimension.<br>
These are the primary reference points as they lie along the jth dimensional<br>
axis.<br>
i: Ranges from one to total number of reference points 'q'<br>
As kj independently varies from 0 to nj for each Lagrange Interpolation Polynomial,<br>
q = (n1+l)*(n2+l)*(n3+1)*...*(nJ + 1)*...*(np+1) (6)<br>
Thus, the co-ordinates for a reference point 'i', corresponding to each dimension, are<br>
given as (k1,k2,...,kj,...,kp).<br>
The reference points, which lie along the dimensional axes, are special points and are<br>
referred to as "primary reference points". In terms of co-ordinates, a reference point is<br>
along the dimensional axis if one and only one of its co-ordinates (kj) has a non-zero<br>
value and all other co-ordinates is zero.<br>
A weight variable with values constrained between zero and unity is associated with<br>
each reference point. Therefore, the total number of weights is the same as the total<br>
number of reference points 'q' A weight value at a reference point, in the context of<br>
this invention, is considered to be representative of the belief value in the cause.<br>
Weights corresponding to primary reference points are chosen as primary or<br>
independent weights and the remaining weights - referred to as secondary weights -<br>
are dependent on, and expressed as a linear combination of primary weights. This<br>
dramatically reduces the number of unknown variables within the network, thereby<br>
reducing the amount of training data required to a practical level as compared with<br>
conventional techniques. For example, for a 'p' dimensional problem, the number of<br>
During the learning or training process, the optimal values for primary weights<br>
(constrained between zero and one) and coefficients used in the linear combination<br>
expression are determined based on any user defined method including generally<br>
available optimisation principles. The secondary weights are also constrained between<br>
zero and one.<br>
The belief value in the occurrence of a cause, based on the known belief values<br>
 quantifying the strength of 'p' associated effects, is given by the<br>
following equation:<br><br>
where,<br>
q: Total number of reference points.<br><br>
wi.: Weight variable associated with the ith reference point.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, a secondary weight is defined as a linear<br>
combination of primary weights. However, the following particular cases of linear<br>
combination may also be used in other preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention.<br>
1. A secondary weight value associated with a reference point is a linear<br>
combination of those primary weight values, which are associated with primary<br>
reference points corresponding to the co-ordinates of the said reference point.<br>
2. A secondary weight value associated with a reference point is a constant<br>
multiplied by the average of primary weight values, which are associated with<br>
primary reference points corresponding to the co-ordinates of the said reference<br>
point.<br>
A Numerical Example of an Exemplary Embodiment of the Present Invention<br>
Two effects, ?1 and ?2, are associated with a cause c. Therefore, two-dimensional<br>
Lagrange Interpolation Polynomials li(?1,?2) will be used for defining the<br>
hypersurface. Quadratic relationship is assumed between belief values for the effect<br>
?1 and the cause c, and also for the effect ?2 and the cause c.<br>
For this example, the belief value in the occurrence of cause c is calculated for a belief<br>
value in the first effect ?1 equal to 0.5 and a belief value in the second effect ?2 equal<br>
to-0.5.<br>
Numbers 1 to 9 in Figure 4 denote equidistant reference points. As a result of<br>
quadratic relationship, (?1 and ?2 equal to 2) three equidistant reference points are<br>
used along each dimension. Using equation (6), it can be seen that the total number of<br>
reference points is 9.<br>
Using equation (7), it can be seen that total number of primary reference points is 5.<br>
These points are also indicated in the following table (Table 1), which shows the coordinates<br>
of all nine reference points in various forms.<br>
Weights associated with primary reference points 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 are primary weights<br>
and are also independent parameters. The secondary weight values at locations 5. 6. S<br>
and 9 are expressed as linear combination of primary weights and in particular<br>
during a learning process are w1, w2, w3, w4, w7 and constant C.<br>
The belief value, in the extent of the occurrence of cause, for a given belief value ?1<br>
equal to 0.5 (representing the strength of effect ?1) and a given belief value ?2 equal<br>
to -0.5 (representing the strength of effect ?2) is calculated as:<br><br>
Using equations (4) and (5), Lagrange Interpolation Polynomials are constructed and<br>
then evaluated at (0.5, -0.5) at all reference points.<br>
Lagrange Interpolation Polynomial for reference point 1:<br><br>
If wl =0.0084, w2 =0.1972, w3 =0.4179, w4 =0.1924, w7= 0.7359 and<br>
C = 1.5656, then using equations (9), (10), (11) and (12) ws = 0.3050, w6 = 0.4778,<br>
wg = 0.7304 and w9 = 0.9032.<br><br>
During a learning or training phase, the predicted belief value (0.3024) is compared<br>
with a known belief value in the training data file to calculate the error. Any of the<br>
known optimisation method is used to calculate new values of primary weights and<br>
coefficients used in the linear combination equations. The new belief value in the<br>
cause is again calculated and the process is repeated until a user defined criterion of<br>
error minimisation is achieved.<br>
The optimal values of primary weights and coefficients in the linear combination<br>
equations are stored and used for future applications.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention has been described above by way of example<br>
only and it will be appreciated by a person skilled in the art that modifications and<br>
variations can be made to the described embodiments without departing from the<br>
scope of the invention.<br>
