BROAD AREA OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention broadly relates to furnace that are used for industrial heat<br>
treatment. Particularly it concerns electrically heated furnaces that have<br>
refractory brick lining<br>
SPECIFIC FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to electrically heated furnaces, used for heating large<br>
objects as is done in metal smelters, forging processes and heat treatment<br>
processes. More specifically it involves the shape, arrangement and performance<br>
of refractory bricks that house the heating coils and also electrically isolate them<br>
from the objects to be heated (job).<br>
BACKGROUND &amp; STATE OF ART OF THE INVENTION<br>
In electrically heated industrial furnaces, the heating coils are placed in the<br>
furnace space in such a manner that the heat is distributed all over as uniformly<br>
as possible. The passage of electric current through the heating elements causes<br><br>
-3-<br>
"ohmic heating", that is proportional to the current carried and that of the<br>
electrical resistance of the coil material. The numerical value of energy<br>
transferred is usually equal to I2R, where I is the current that flows, expressed in<br>
amperes and R is the resistance, expressed in Ohms.<br>
One of the primary requirements of the construction of such furnaces is that the<br>
heating coil that carries current is electrically isolated from the rest of the<br>
surroundings. At the same time, ensuring effective transfer of heat from the<br>
heating coil to the entire furnace space is also of great importance. Usually<br>
heating elements are mounted on the sidewalls and top wall, from where heat is<br>
transferred by "direct radiation" to the charge (job); whereas coils placed at the<br>
floor of the furnace or below the "furnace table" manage to transfer the heat<br>
only by conducting to the refractory floor and there further by contact or<br>
radiation to the "charge". This heat transfer compared to the direct radiation<br>
heat transfer is less intense and invariably takes a longer time for a given<br>
amount of heat to be transferred. Therefore, the bottom portion of any 'charge'<br>
takes the longest time before getting heated to any specified temperature.<br><br>
-4-<br>
SHORTCOMINGS OF STATE OF ART<br>
Typically the furnace floor refractory bricks are manufactured with profiled<br>
grooves or 'coil receptacles' for accommodating the heating elements. The 'as-<br>
moulded' bricks are laid in position and then the electric heating coils are<br>
externally inserted from outside. The predominant mode of heat transfer from<br>
the coil to furnace space is conduction and diffuse radiation from the brick<br>
surface. The conventional method inherently suffers from the disadvantages that<br>
heat energy get accumulated within the brick causing overheating and failure of<br>
heating elements. Additionally the furnace bricks get damaged due to melting of<br>
coils. Longer duration of heating cycles due to poor heat energy evacuation<br>
from the heating coils results in more energy consumption for the given load.<br>
In an attempt to address and solve some of the above problems, the proposed<br>
innovative bricks are configured in two-parts. This improved configuration<br>
facilitates easy assembly, handling and maintenance. Most importantly, the novel<br>
brick permits efficient evacuation of heat from the heating coils to the furnace<br>
space, by a combined multi-mode heat transfer that employs all of convection,<br>
conduction and radiation of heat.<br><br>
-5-<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the invention to enhance the performance of furnace bricks,<br>
through a unique constructive design that houses the heating coil as well as<br>
forms the refractory floor / bed for electrically heated furnaces.<br>
Another object is to prescribe the method of employing such bricks to achieve<br>
efficient operation, enhanced performance and ease of maintenance.<br>
A still another objective of the invention is to accommodate instrument leads like<br>
thermocouples, pressure probes, potential probes etc. in the grooves formed in<br>
the brick instead of heating coils.<br>
The innovative heating-element-holding refractory bricks for furnaces, comprises<br>
of two main parts. The bottom part holds the electric heating element. This part<br>
is made of suitable refractory material for the required operating temperature<br>
ranges. The shape and size of this brick too depend on the rating and size of the<br>
heating element that it will accommodate. The bricks have suitable provisions to<br>
make them stackable horizontally over the required length of heating element.<br><br>
-6-<br>
The top part acts as a protection cover for the heating coils. Convention<br>
openings are provided in both the parts. These openings are so located that no<br>
loose object can fall or come into contact with the heating coil that is contained<br>
within. Further, the location and shape of these openings ensure that the heat<br>
energy released by the electric heating elements from the bottom part will be<br>
efficiently evacuated and converted out to the hearth. The top part remains<br>
assembled on to the bottom part during normal furnace operation but can be slid<br>
away easily for gaining access to heating coils or for any other maintenance need<br>
that may warrant removal/replacement of heating coils. The said split refractory<br>
bricks are configured into shapes such as parallelogram, cubic, cylindrical,<br>
ellipsoidal form etc.<br>
According to the invention there is provided furnace refractory bricks to<br>
accommodate heating coils for building furnace floor with improved self-life and<br>
for optimized uniform heating of furnace comprising<br>
- a two part split assembly of bottom and top cover part, the bottom<br>
part consisting of a base, two side walls, a divider dividing a gap<br>
between the side walls creating a multiple coil grooves running along<br><br>
-7-<br>
the length of the brick side walls to accommodate heating coils, a<br>
stepped bearing surface provided on both top surfaces of the side<br>
walls, a downward slopped lifting relief provided at the upper surface<br>
of a centrally cut mid-section of the side walls to form slots for<br>
converting and dissipating heat generated by the heating coil;<br>
- the top cover consisting of a central part with two side flanges running<br>
along the length of the top part, a lifting relief forming sloping<br>
passages to form a hollow cavity, a bottom surface provided below the<br>
flange sit over the bearing surfaces of the bottom part in matching<br>
relationship, convection flutes provided below the central part<br>
communicating the hollow cavity via the coil grooves to the exterior<br>
furnace space to channel away most of heat of coil by convection into<br>
the furnace thus enabling optimized, uniform heat transfer of heating<br>
coil.<br>
The present invention relates also to a method of producing furnace refractory<br>
bricks to accommodate heating coils for building furnace floor/ bed with<br>
improved self-life and optimized uniform heating of furnace comprising the steps<br><br>
-8-<br>
of preparing refractory brick concrete from refractory constituents, and bonding<br>
agents on mixing and casting the mix into two separate split part assembly in<br>
two preformed moulds and curving the casted two parts to constitute a bottom<br>
part consisting of a base, two side walls, a divider dividing a gap between the<br>
side walls thus creating a multiple coil grooves running along the length of the<br>
brick to accommodate heating coils, a stepped bearing surface provided on both<br>
top surfaces of the side walls, a downward slopped lifting relief provided at the<br>
upper surface of a centrally cut mid-section of the side walls to from slots for<br>
converting and dissipating heat generated by the heating coil; a top cover part<br>
consisting of a central part with two side flanges running along the length of the<br>
top part, a lifting relief forming a slopping passages to form a hollow cavity<br>
provided below the flange sit when put over the bearing surfaces of the bottom<br>
part, convection flutes provided below the central part communicating with the<br>
hollow cavity via the coil grooves to the exterior furnace space to channel away<br>
the heat of heating coil by convection into the furnace to enable uniform heat<br>
transfer of heating coil, when the said top part is placed over the bottom part<br>
and the furnace walls when formed with mating brick assemblies are heated by<br>
the coil provided in the coil grooves in the brick assemblies.<br><br>
-9-<br>
The invention will be better understood by the following description with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings in which<br>
Figure 1        depicts prior art arrangement of heating coil.<br>
Figure 2       depicts the bottom part of the innovative coil-holding<br>
brick according to the present invention.<br>
Figure 3        depicts the top cover as top and bottom view that is<br>
assembled on top of the coil-holder during normal<br>
operation according to the present invention.<br>
Figure 4        shows a typical assembly of the refractory brick with heating coils<br>
and top cover in place according to the present invention.<br>
A typical conventional arrangement of heating coil (C) and one piece refractory<br>
brick (A) is depicted in Figure-1.<br><br>
-10-<br>
The electric heating coils (C) are shrouded by the coil cavity (B) from the furnace<br>
space so that oxide scales or other loose objects do not fall on the coils or come<br>
into contact with the coils, causing a potential electric short-circuit or grounding.<br>
Further, the heat energy from the bottom heating elements does not reach out<br>
from the bricks to the furnace surface efficiently, because of which the heat<br>
energy released by the heating elements (C) gets accumulated within the brick,<br>
often leading to over heating and mechanical failure of the heating elements.<br>
Owing to the above, the uniformity of temperature distribution all around the job<br>
suffers owing to the less efficient heat transfer from bottom surface compared to<br>
the sidewalls and roof. Additionally, replacement of the faulty or damaged<br>
heating elements poses difficulty whenever a damaged element melts and gets<br>
stuck inside the element groove (B) of the brick. Because of this the entire brick<br>
housing the faulty element warrants replacement, though the brick by itself could<br>
be undamaged. This in turn cause the furnace downtime to increase, and result<br>
in difficulties of the heating elements to be matched and inserted on to the other<br>
bricks that are already in place.<br><br>
-11-<br>
In Figures 2, 3 and 4 the bottom part or the "coil holder" essentially has a 'base'<br>
(1)	that is preferably rectangular in shape. There are two 'sidewalls' (02) that<br>
run the length of the coil-holder. The gap between the two sidewalls is separated<br>
by a 'divider' (03) creating the heating 'coil groove' (04). There can also be more<br>
than one divider (03), in order to create multiple 'coil grooves'. The sidewalls<br>
(2)	have a stepped shape that receive and act as a stopper for the top cover<br>
shown in figure 3. The bearing surfaces' (05) support the hearth plate, "charge"<br>
or "job" that the furnaces hold. The height of the step from the inner floor<br>
surface of the base (1) is tailor made for the chosen coil type. The two sidewalls<br>
(02) have 'lifting relief (06) about the mid-section of the longer sides to permit<br>
easier handling while assembling and during maintenance. The lifting relief (06)<br>
also defines a rectangular or other geometrical slot of a 'convection opening' (07)<br>
that helps to convert away and dissipate the heat generated by the heating coils.<br>
The lifting relief (06) has a specific downward slope that helps to prevent any<br>
foreign matter like oxide scale etc from entering the heating coil groove from<br>
furnace space.<br><br>
-12-<br>
The double hollow feature (12) in the central part on the top half of the brick is<br>
acting like a collection chute for the heat energy and release them through<br>
convection flutes (13) so that the energy gets distributed uniformly from the<br>
bottom coils throughout the furnace.<br>
The top cover has a 'central part' (08) and two side flanges (09) that run the<br>
length of the brick. The top cover also has lifting relief (10) and sloping<br>
passages identical to that of the bottom part. The bottom surfaces (11) of the<br>
flange will sit over the stepped shape in bearing surfaces (05) of bottom part<br>
during assembly. There is a 'hollow cavity' (12) on the underside of the top<br>
cover. This aids heat from coils to be converted away. There are 'convection<br>
flutes' (13) provided below the central part, that communicate from the hollow<br>
cavity (12) to the exterior that help effectively channeling away most of the heat<br>
by convention into the furnace.<br>
Figure 4 shows a typical assembly with heating coils (14) placed in the coil<br>
grooves (4). As can be seen the brick assembly with repeated features both<br>
along length and width for making a mosaic of brick-lined furnace floor.<br><br>
-13-<br>
The innovative 'two-part' assembly results in significant advantage such as:<br>
1.	The heating elements can be assembled from top easily.<br>
2.	The ventifation openings provided on the bottom bricks and the top<br>
cover will allow the complete release of heat energy to reach the<br>
bottom hearth surface.<br>
3.	The Scales from the heat treatment jobs will not fall on the bottom<br>
heating elements.<br>
4.	Failed bottom brick alone can be replaced.<br>
5.	Condition of the heating elements by visual / testing can be done by<br>
just opening the top part.<br>
6.	Cleaning the coil zone and maintaining them are easier.<br>
7.	The scales can be wiped out easily with out disturbing the element /<br>
brick assembly in a very least time.<br><br>
-14-<br>
8.	Handling and installing are very easier and skill not required.<br>
9.	Interchangeability of the bricks and top cover assembly.<br>
10.	Easy for manufacture and hence cheaper.<br>
Though the invention has been narrated and illustrated with a preferred<br>
embodiment the same should not be read and construed in a restrictive manner<br>
as various adaptations, modifications, alterations are possible within the scope<br>
and limit of the invention as defined in the encompassed appended claims.<br><br>
