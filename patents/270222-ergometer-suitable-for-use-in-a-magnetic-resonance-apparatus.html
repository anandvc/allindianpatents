Ergometer suitable for use in a<br>
magnetic resonance apparatus<br>
The present invention relates to an ergometer and a process<br>
for operating an ergometer which is particularly suitable for<br>
examining a test person or patient in a magnetic resonance<br>
(MR) apparatus. Such examinations are carried out, inter<br>
alia, in the fields of medical diagnostics and sports science.<br>
Exercising different muscle groups is a frequently used method<br>
to examine muscle function in the fields of sports medicine<br>
and cardiovascular medicine. What is referred to as the 31P-<br>
MRS process (Phosphorus-31 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance<br>
Spectroscopy) is a suitable examination process wherein the<br>
blood flow in a stimulated muscle is measured locally in a<br>
magnetic resonance apparatus. This way, energy metabolites in<br>
the muscle, such as for example phosphocreatine, inorganic<br>
phosphate or adenosine triphosphate, can be measured<br>
quantitatively. By means of the 31P-MRS process it is also<br>
possible to record the energy metabolites when exercising the<br>
muscles of the calf. Initially, there is a decrease in<br>
phosphocreatine when the muscle is exercised to a certain<br>
degree until the oxygen supply in the muscle is raised to such<br>
an extent that the increased energy requirements can be met by<br>
the oxidative metabolism alone. In that case, the<br>
phosphocreatine breakdown reaches an equilibrium state. If<br>
due to a stenosis in a supplying blood vessel the blood flow<br>
and thus the oxygen supply cannot be increased to meet the<br>
demand, the phosphocreatine decreases progressively.<br>
The use of an ergometer in a strong magnetic field is<br>
problematic since many components have to be manufactured from<br>
- 1 -<br><br>
non-ferromagnetic metals and/or wood or plastic materials so<br>
that the device can be operated in an artefact-free manner and<br>
will function correctly, e.g. in a magnetic resonance<br>
tomograph. Also, sensors and cables for measuring device<br>
parameters such as force and travel have to be provided such<br>
that they do not cause measuring artefacts. Furthermore, it<br>
has to be possible to set a defined and reproducible force, or<br>
resistance, in an ergometer which has to be overcome by a test<br>
person or patient to set a drive means, which can e.g. be a<br>
pedal, in motion. Furthermore, it is useful if during<br>
ergometry the work output can be set, measured, or calculated,<br>
and adjusted accordingly while the ergometer is operated.<br>
When using an ergometer, the test person or patient presses<br>
against a defined resistance at a set frequency, with the<br>
deflection angle of the pedal and friction playing an<br>
important role as well. The frequency is usually given by a<br>
metronome and the force is measured by means of piezo<br>
technology. In commercially available ergometers which are<br>
operated outside of magnetic fields, the force setting is<br>
automatically readjusted via a feedback control system by<br>
means of suitable electronic or mechanic devices during the<br>
operation if the test person does not maintain the frequency<br>
or angle deflection. The use of an ergometer only makes sense<br>
if such feedback control systems are in place. The ergometers<br>
suitable for use in an MR apparatus which are currently<br>
commercially available do not comprise such a feedback control<br>
system. Moreover, in the commercially available ergometers<br>
the measuring result is falsified in a non-linear manner due<br>
to frictional resistance during the motion of the drive means<br>
so that a measuring error cannot be calculated reliably.<br>
It is therefore the object of the present invention to provide<br>
an improved ergometer, and/or an improved ergometer<br>
arrangement, which preferably overcomes the disadvantages<br>
described above.<br>
-2-<br><br>
This object is achieved by the features described in the<br>
patent claims.<br>
The invention is based on the fundamental idea of providing an<br>
ergometer which is particularly suitable for examining a test<br>
person or patient in a magnetic resonance apparatus. The test<br>
person or patient has to apply a certain force, which can be<br>
pre-set, at a drive means in order to set a piston/cylinder<br>
array in motion. This essentially causes the piston and the<br>
cylinder to move relative to each other. The force necessary<br>
to overcome the resistance presented by the piston/cylinder<br>
array can be controlled or regulated, in particular during the<br>
motion of the drive means. This can be done manually by<br>
specialist staff or with the help of appropriate instructions<br>
e.g. from an instructing computer program wherein the<br>
instructions are essentially based on the evaluations of the<br>
measured data. Preferably, such a computer program also<br>
automatically controls the operation. Preferably, the force<br>
range is changed manually by the specialist staff and then<br>
regulated automatically in the corresponding range. The<br>
evaluation of the work output or performance by the test<br>
person is very concise since in the present invention friction<br>
loss has been minimized to a negligible value. Friction<br>
losses can essentially be avoided by providing a cushion,<br>
preferably an air cushion, in the piston/cylinder array<br>
between the piston and the cylinder at least during relative<br>
motion.<br>
All the components used in the ergometer were examined for<br>
their suitability in an MR apparatus, and the ergometer<br>
preferably consists of non-ferromagnetic materials, such as<br>
e.g. plastics or wood, and was furthermore only processed with<br>
tools which do not cause metal abrasion on the individual<br>
components.<br>
-3-<br><br>
The resistance, or the force, that has to be overcome or<br>
applied at the drive means to set it in motion is generated by<br>
a pneumatic system in the sense of a piston/cylinder system.<br>
In addition to compressed air, which is preferred, fluids of<br>
all kinds can be used. Preferably, compressible fluids are<br>
used. The piston is constructed such that a narrow air<br>
cushion forms between the piston and the cylinder which<br>
diminishes friction to such a degree that it is negligible in<br>
the calculation of the work output. An air vessel is provided<br>
between a compressed air inlet and the cylinder so that air<br>
pressure can be controlled or regulated infinitely at any<br>
time, even during the measurement. A computer-controlled<br>
control system is preferably used for this purpose, which is<br>
operated outside of the MR apparatus forming the Faraday cage.<br>
Thus, no electronic device is present inside or close to the<br>
MR tube in order not to affect the measuring results. The<br>
control module comprises a pressure sensor and a pressure<br>
regulator as well as a computer with the appropriate software.<br>
The work output of the exercising muscles can be regulated in<br>
particular by the pressure in the cylinder, the depth of the<br>
piston's submergence into the cylinder and the frequency of<br>
the plantar flexion. The actual depth of the piston's<br>
submergence into the cylinder is measured; this will be<br>
explained in more detail in the description of the<br>
embodiments. The frequency is given by a metronome which<br>
provides different frequencies, whereby the test person or<br>
patient should follow the beat of the metronome when operating<br>
the ergometer. In addition to the frequency and the air<br>
pressure, the depth of the piston's submergence into the<br>
cylinder is also preferably infinitely variable. An<br>
appropriate program calculates the various parameters at a<br>
desired work output in watt or the watt number based on set<br>
parameters.<br>
-4-<br><br>
In another preferred embodiment of the ergometer as a pedal<br>
ergometer, the test person or patient preferably lies on<br>
his/her back during the measurement with his/her foot attached<br>
to a pedal with two straps. Furthermore, additional strap<br>
fixations are provided in the calf area and the shoulders in<br>
order to avoid motion artefacts. The fixation of the upper<br>
body can be adjusted to the height of the patient so that<br>
plantar flexion can be carried out to a pre-set stop and a<br>
full extension of the knee joint, respectively. A measuring<br>
coil is placed directly under the muscle or muscle group to be<br>
measured, preferably the muscles of the calf. In order to<br>
optimize the measuring result, the calf is placed in the<br>
middle of the measuring coil so that the distance between calf<br>
and measuring coil is minimized. Preferably, only one calf is<br>
measured in order to make use of the intensity of the measured<br>
signal in the center underneath the calf and thus reduce the<br>
measuring time. This is furthermore advantageous because no<br>
measuring artefacts from a second calf affect the result.<br>
Another preferred embodiment of the ergometer is an arm<br>
ergometer wherein the mechanism of the arm ergometer<br>
corresponds to that of the pedal ergometer. Instead of leg<br>
muscles, the arm muscle to be measured, e.g. the brachial or<br>
the antebrachial muscle, is placed in an appropriate position<br>
relative to the measuring device. In this embodiment, the<br>
test person or patient can be in a standing, sitting or lying<br>
position.<br>
In the following, the invention will be described based on<br>
exemplary preferred embodiments with reference to the<br>
drawings.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a schematic view of an embodiment of the device<br>
according to the present invention,<br>
-5-<br><br>
Fig. 2a shows a schematic view of an embodiment of the<br>
piston/cylinder array of the device according to the<br>
present invention,<br>
Fig. 2b shows a schematic sectional view of an embodiment of<br>
the piston/cylinder array of the device according to<br>
the present invention and<br>
Fig. 3 shows a schematic view of an embodiment of measuring<br>
the distance by means of a rotation angle wheel and a<br>
bending beam of the device of according to the<br>
present invention.<br>
Figure 1 shows a schematic perspective view of a preferred<br>
embodiment of an ergometer as a pedal ergometer 1. The<br>
components of the ergometer 1 consist of non-ferromagnetic<br>
materials so as to allow a use of the ergometer in an MR<br>
apparatus. On a base plate 2, a drive means, which in this<br>
preferred embodiment as a pedal ergometer is a pedal 3, is<br>
essentially movably provided with a fixture 5 via one or a<br>
pair of bearing pins 4, wherein the fixture 5 is firmly<br>
attached to the base plate 2. The drive means varies<br>
according to the body part to be measured, or the muscle(s) to<br>
be exercised, and is preferably designed such that when the<br>
drive means is deflected, the muscle to be measured or<br>
examined has to be exercised. For instance, the drive means<br>
can be designed such that essentially the desired muscles or<br>
muscle groups are exercised with known exercises such as e.g.<br>
butterfly, bench pressing, biceps curls, latissimus pull-down,<br>
leg extension, leg curl, leg adduction, leg press and/or cable<br>
cross. Thus, other embodiments of the drive means are e.g.<br>
handles, loops and other devices known from weight training.<br>
Preferably, the muscle to be measured essentially lies still<br>
on the measuring unit or measuring coil. For example, in the<br>
case of the pedal ergometer, the pedal 3 is therefore operated<br>
from the ankle joint in order to keep the calf as still as<br>
possible on top of the measuring coil. The drive means can<br>
-6-<br><br>
preferably be attached on-center to a body part of a test<br>
person or patient to be measured so that the results supplied<br>
by the measuring coil provided in the measuring coil holder 6<br>
are as concise as possible. A pneumatic piston/cylinder array<br>
7 is provided between the drive means, such as e.g. the pedal<br>
3, and a fixture on the base plate 2 such that when the drive<br>
means is deflected by a test person or a patient, the piston<br>
20 moves relative to the cylinder 21. The pneumatically<br>
applied pressure of the piston/cylinder array 7 constitutes a<br>
resistance or force when the test person or patient operates<br>
the pedal 3. The pedal 3 preferably comprises a stop which<br>
protects the piston 20 from knocking against the bottom of the<br>
cylinder 21. This way, damage to the piston/cylinder array 7<br>
can be prevented.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the ergometer according to<br>
the present invention as an arm ergometer, the ergometer is<br>
operated with muscles of the arm to be measured. The<br>
muscle(s) to be measured are positioned in a manner analogous<br>
to that described in connection with the pedal ergometer.<br>
The pneumatically applied pressure of the piston/cylinder<br>
array 7 is supplied from a compressed air inlet connected to<br>
the cylinder 21. Preferably, an air vessel 8 is provided<br>
between the ergometer 1 and the compressed air inlet. This<br>
air vessel 8 is designed such that the air pressure applied at<br>
the piston/cylinder array 7 can be controlled or regulated via<br>
a control means, which will be explained in more detail below,<br>
and furthermore guarantees that no high or short-term load<br>
peaks result from the counter-pressure when the drive means,<br>
e.g. the pedal 3, is deflected. The force to be applied is in<br>
a range of from 50 N to 900 N, or from 100 N to 800 N, or from<br>
200 N to 700 N, or from 300 N to 600 N and is preferably about<br>
600 N for healthy test persons and about 300 N for patients<br>
whose movement of the body part in question is restricted.<br>
-7-<br><br>
The ergometer 1 preferably comprises a control means whose<br>
sensors and accompanying protected cables can be provided<br>
within the examination chamber of the magnetic resonance<br>
apparatus. The electronic controls of the control means are<br>
located outside of the examination chamber of the magnetic<br>
resonance apparatus. The control means regulates the air<br>
pressure at the piston/cylinder array 7 and thus the pressure<br>
exerted onto the piston 20 which constitutes the force<br>
necessary to be applied by a test person or patient in order<br>
to deflect the drive means, e.g. the pedal 3. This control<br>
means preferably comprises a computer and a computer program<br>
for controlling and/or processing acquired data.<br>
The determination of the force to be applied at the drive<br>
means is carried out by one or several sensors provided at the<br>
piston 20 which convert a mechanical deformation to an<br>
electric signal or an electric resistance change. Preferably,<br>
a strain indicator 23 is used for this purpose. In the area<br>
of a strain indicator, the diameter of the piston 20 of the<br>
piston/cylinder array 7 is smaller than in the cylinder<br>
guidance. Furthermore, at least in the area of the strain<br>
indicator, the piston 20 can be hollow. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, the modulus of elasticity of the piston 20 is<br>
ideally 3,000 N/mm2.<br>
The resistance or force necessary to set the drive means or<br>
the pedal 3 in motion can be controlled or regulated in<br>
particular during operation. The resistance or force can be<br>
automatically or electronically regulated or e.g. controlled<br>
manually based on the signals measured during the examination<br>
of the test person or patient. Furthermore, the piston 20 and<br>
the cylinder 21 are sized such that an air cushion is formed<br>
between them at least during operation or when they move<br>
relative to each other. Due to this air cushion, the<br>
-8-<br><br>
frictional resistance becomes negligible and consequently, the<br>
measured values are considerably more precise. The<br>
piston/cylinder array 7 comprises a gap between the piston 20<br>
and the cylinder 21 of 0.02 mm to 0.05 mm, or 0.03 mm to 0.05<br>
mm, or 0.02 mm to 0.04 mm, or 0.03 to 0.04 mm, and preferably<br>
the gap is about 0.035 mm.<br>
Furthermore, in a preferred embodiment as pedal ergometer<br>
fixations are provided, such as e.g. a strap fixation for the<br>
test person's foot, calf and shoulders, which can also be<br>
adjusted to the height of the test person or patient.<br>
In another preferred embodiment as an arm ergometer,<br>
corresponding fixations are provided e.g. for the hand or<br>
forearm of the test person or patient.<br>
For measuring the distance of the motion of the drive means, a<br>
carbon spring comprising at least one strain indicator is<br>
provided parallel to the pneumatic cylinder 21. This way,<br>
conclusions can be drawn regarding the motion of the drive<br>
means, e.g. the pedaling motion, as a function of the output<br>
signal of the strain indicator. This carbon spring is<br>
designed such that it exhibits a spring constant over a long<br>
spring travel, and the spring is operated in this range of the<br>
spring travel.<br>
Figure 2a shows a schematic view of a piston/cylinder array 7,<br>
and Figure 2b shows a sectional view of this piston/cylinder<br>
array 7. By means of an adapter 22, the force range to be<br>
applied by the test person or patient can be modified in the<br>
ranges described above, preferably depending on whether a<br>
patient or a test person is examined. This is done by firmly<br>
attaching the piston diameter effective in the cylinder either<br>
to the cylinder 21 or the piston 20 using an adapter 22 which<br>
-9-<br><br>
encircles the piston 20. Preferably, the adapter 22 is<br>
screwed to the part at issue.<br>
Figure 3 shows the measuring of the distance by means of a<br>
rotation angle wheel 32 and a bending beam 31. When the drive<br>
means is deflected, the bending beam 31 is deflected and the<br>
distance traveled by the drive means is determined. For this<br>
purpose, the rotation angle wheel 32 is attached to an<br>
eccentric rotating pin 34 used as an axis, and the rotation<br>
angle wheel 32 is moved as a consequence of the deflection of<br>
the drive means, e.g. the pedal 3, and in turn deflects the<br>
bending beam 31. Thus, the bending beam 31, whose one end is<br>
firmly attached to a fixing device 30, is deflected. At least<br>
one strain indicator 33 is provided at the bending beam 31<br>
such that the deformation of the bending beam 31 is converted<br>
to an electronic signal.<br>
The invention also encompasses embodiments combining features<br>
from different embodiments described above.<br>
