This invention relates to a process for preparing acid salts of Gemifloxacin, that is, 7-(3-aniinomethyl-4-methoxyiminopyrrolidin-1 -yl)-1 -cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-4-oxo- 1,4-diliydro-l,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid (hereinafter referred to Gemifloxacin), having a potent antimicrobial activity and represented by the following formula 1:<br>
wherein, <br>
Me represents methyl,<br>
HA is an organic acid or an inorganic acid.<br>
Said Gemifloxacin and its salts are compounds disclosed in Korean Patent No. 131999 to the present inventors (Korean Patent Application No. 94-13604, foreign patents corresponding to this patent: EP 688722 Al, IP Patent No. 41050/1996, Russian Patent No.2120940, Canadian Patent No. 2151890, Chinese Patent No. 1114959, and US Patent Nos. 5962468, 5869670, 5840916, 5776944, 5698570 and 5633262). These compounds have a potent antimicrobial activity, and moreover can be effectively used as agents for eating human being or animals infected by bacteria.<br>
2<br><br>
The present inventors had prepared said acid salts of Gemifloxacin by a three-step reaction process, that is, a synthesis process through a coupling reaction, a salt formation, and a recrystallization, as represented by the following reaction scheme 1:<br><br>
wherein.<br>
Me represents methyl, 10     R represents CI, F, Br, I, methanesulfonyl, or paratoluenesulfonyl,<br>
HX represents hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, trifluoroacetic acid,<br>
methanesulfonic acid, paratolunesulfonic acid, or sulfuric acid, HA is an organic acid or an inorganic acid.<br>
15 As shown in the above reaction scheme 1, the compound (1) is prepared through three-step reaction process, that is, a coupling reaction, a salt formation and a recrystallization. The reason why the three-step reaction process is carried out is because the compound (8) as impurity is formed in an amount of approximately 6-12% by a side-reaction under the coupling reaction and the compoimd (8) is remained in the compound (6) in an amount of<br>
20 approximately 0.3 to 1.0%. To remove the resulting impurity through the coupling reaction at 0.1% or less, the second step, that is a salt formation process, had to be carried out.    Finally, the organic solvent used in the salt formation process had to be removed<br><br><br>
from the step of recrystallization.<br>
Through the three step process, an acid salt of Gemifloxacin (1) as a raw medicine having high purity was prepared in about 65% of total yield.    Since the resulting impurity (8) 5     from the coupling reaction of the above process was difScult to be removed, the salt formation and recrystallization steps for removing the impurity had to be carried out.<br><br>
10<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
The present inventors have conducted intensive studies in view of reducing the above three-step reaction process to a two-step process. As a result, they have found that the 15 preparing process comprising two steps below have several advantages, such as simpUcity of the preparation process, improvement of productivity and increase of yield. Therefore, they have completed the present invention.<br>
The present invention provides a process for preparing acid salts of Gemifloxacin 20     represented by formula 1, which comprises the steps of<br>
a)	adding a compoimd of fomula 5 to naphthyridine carboxylic acid of formula 2 and 3-<br>
aniinomethyl-4-methoxyiminopyn:olidine salt of fonnula 3 in water, an organic solvent<br>
or a mixed solvent thereof in the presence of an organic base to carry out a coupling<br>
25	reaction, and<br>
b)	adding an acid of fonnula HA to the resulting compound of fonnula 4 in water, an<br>
organic solvent or a mixed solvent thereof to carry out deprotection and salt formation<br><br><br><br>
Me represents methyl,<br>
HX represents hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, methanesulfonic acid, paratolunesulfonic acid, or suliiiric acid,<br>
Rl and R2 independently of each other represent hydrogen, a straight or branched,<br>
5	saturated or unsaturated C1—C6 alkyl group, a saturated or unsaturated C3~C6<br>
cycloaUcyl group, or an aromatic group which is unsubstituted or substituted by C1—C6alkyl, C1—C6 alkoxy, hydroxy, cyano or halogen, or<br>
Rl and R2 together with a carbonyl group to which they are bonded form a ring, and<br>
HA is an organic acid or an inorganic acid. 10<br><br><br>
recrystallization to one step by preventing production of impurity (8), the compound (5) having a carbonyl group may be added to the compound (3) under a coupling reaction to protect a primary amino group in the compound (3) with the compound (5). Due to this protection, production of by-product (8) may be remarkably prevented in an amount of 5 0.1% or less. The resultant compound (4), which is prepared from the above process in a yield of about 90% or more, is treated with an acid of formula HA to carry out deprotection and salt formation reactions by one step. By means of the above procedure omitting the step of the recrystallization reaction, an acid salt of Gemifloxacin of the compound (1) is produced in a yield of 90% or more, and the steps of the preparation process are simpUfied. 10 In accordance with such a simplification of the preparation process, the following several effects can be obtained: reducing production time, improving productivity and increasing yield.<br>
The process according to the present invention is explained as an example in detail as 15     below:<br>
First, the synthesis process of the compound (4) (step a) comprises dissolving the compound (3), the compound (5) and an organic base, for example triethylamine in a reaction solvent, for example a mixed solvent of acetonitrile with water, and adding the 20 compound (2) thereto, and then reacting the resulting mixture. The reaction conditions of this reaction are as follows:<br>
1)	As a reaction solvent, water, an organic solvent, such as acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran<br>
(THF), methanol, and ethanol, or a mixed solvent of an organic solvent with water may<br>
25	be used.   Preferably, a mixed solvent of acetonitrile with water is advantageous in view<br>
of purity and yield.<br>
2)	As a compound (5), ketone or aldehyde compound, such as formaldehyde, acetone,<br>
benzaldehyde, 1-butylaldehyde, and the like, may be used.   Preferably, benzaldehyde<br>
30	derivative, such as benzaldehyde, 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, 2-chlorobenzaldehyde and<br>
7<br><br>
the like is advantageous in view of purity and yield.   Particularly, benzaldehyde is the most advantageous in view of cost and stability. It is preferred that benzaldehye is used in an amount of the molar amount equal to or more than the molar amount of the compound (2). 5<br>
3) A reaction temperature may be applied thereto in the wide range of 0"C to 80 °C. However, the most preferred temperature is in the range of 20~30°C in view of reaction rate, yield and purity.<br>
10 4) As an organic base, triethylamine, trimethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, DBU (1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene), DBN (l,5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-5-one), as well as a number of the other bases may be used. The most suitable base is triethylamine in view of cost and yield. The amount thereof is used in 3 or more molar amount relative to the compound (2). 15<br>
By carrying out the above reaction process, the compound (4) having high purity may be produced in high yield (more than 90%).<br>
Second, the process (step b) for preparing the compound (1) from the compound (4) 20 comprises dissolving the compound (4) in a reaction solvent, for example, a mixed solvent of isopropanol with water, heating the resultant mixture, adding an acid of formula HA, for example, methansulfonic acid, thereto to carry out deprotection and salt formation reactions at the same time, and then cooling the reaction material to prepare the compovmd (1) without the recrystallization step. The reaction conditions of this reaction are as 25     follows:<br>
1) As a reaction solvent, water, alcohol, such as isopropanol, THF, methanol, ethanol, butanol and the like, or a mixed solvent of alcohol with water may be used.   Preferably, a mixed solvent of isopropanol with water is advantageous in view of purity and yield. 30<br><br>
2)	As an acid, a number of acids representing HA, such as hydrochloric acid,<br>
methanesulfonic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, acetic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid,<br>
perhydrochloric acid, picric acid, (+)-camphor sulfonic acid and the like may be used.<br>
Particularly, methansulfonic acid is the most suitable.   It is preferred that the molar<br>
5        amount equal to that of the compound (4) to about 20% or so of the equal molar amount is used in view of purity and yield.<br>
3)	A reaction temperature may be applied thereto in the wide range of 0°C to 100°C.<br>
However, the reaction temperature of 40~50°C on adding an acid and the reaction<br>
10        temperature of 0~20°C after adding the acid are preferred, in view of reaction rate of the final compound (1), yield and purity.<br>
By carrying out the above reaction process, the compound (4) having high purity may be produced in high yield (more than 90%).<br>
15<br>
As described hereinbefore, if a novel synthesis process of two steps is used, the improved effect such as simplicity of the preparation process, increase of yield (from about 65% to at least 80%), improvement of productivity, decrease of manufacturing costs and the like can be achieved by reducing three steps of conventional   synthesis process to two steps.<br>
20     Specifically, it has an advantage that this process may be applied to quinolone type antibiotics having a similar structure to that of Gemifloxacin.<br>
Therefore, the present invention provides an outstandingly improved technique over the prior art. 25<br>
The present invention is explained in detail by means of the following examples, which are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
