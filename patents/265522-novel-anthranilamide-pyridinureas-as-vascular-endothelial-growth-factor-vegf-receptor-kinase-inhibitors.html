				<td>Novel Anthranilamide Pyridinureas as Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) Receptor Kinase Inhibitors<br>
The invention relates to novel anthranilamide pyridinureas as VEGF receptor kinase inhibitors, their production and use as pharmaceutical agents for preventing or treating diseases that are triggered by persistent angiogenesis.<br>
Many diseases are known to be associated with persistent angiogenesis, for example, diseases such as tumor- or metastases-growth; psoriasis; arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis, hemangioma, endometriosis, angiofibroma; eye diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, neovascular glaucoma; renal diseases, such as glomerulonephritis, diabetic nephropathy, malignant nephrosclerosis, thrombotic microangiopathic syndrome, transplant rejections and glomerulopathy; fibrotic diseases, such as cirrhosis of the liver, mesangial cell proliferative diseases and arteriosclerosis.<br>
Lyrnphangiogenesis is a process accompanying tumor growth and metastases. It is prominent in lymphedema, lymphangiectasia, lymphangioma, and lymphangiosarcoma and in asthmatic disease, where lymph vessels are chronically overexpressed in the lung.<br>
Persistent angiogenesis is induced by the factor VEGF via its receptors. In order for VEGF to exert this action, it is necessary that VEGF bind to the receptor, and that a tyrosine phosphorylation is induced.<br>
Direct or indirect inhibition of the VEGF receptor can be used for preventing or treating such diseases and other VEGF-induced pathological angiogenesis and vascular permeable conditions, such as tumor vascularization. For example, it is known that the growth of tumors can be inhibited by soluble receptors and antibodies against VEGF, an example for the latter being AvastinÂ® whose treatment paradigm has been introduced in human cancer therapy.<br><br>
Anthranilic acid amides effective in the treatment of psoriasis; arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis, hemangioma, angiofibroma; eye diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, neovascular glaucoma; renal diseases, such as glomerulonephritis, diabetic nephropathy, malignant nephrosclerosis, thrombic microangiopathic syndrome, transplant rejections and glomerulopathy; fibrotic diseases, such as cirrhosis of the liver, mesangial cell proliferative diseases, arteriosclerosis, injuries to nerve tissue, and for inhibiting the reocclusion of vessels after balloon catheter treatment, in vascular prosthetics or after mechanical devices are used to keep vessels open, such as, e.g., stents, have been reported in WO 00/27820.<br>
Anthranilic acid amides that are effective in the treatment of tumor or metastasis growth, psoriasis, Kaposi's sarcoma, restenosis, such as, e.g., stent-induced restenosis, endometriosis, Crohn's disease, Hodgkin's disease, leukemia; arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis, hemangioma, angiofibroma; eye diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, neovascular glaucoma; renal diseases, such as glomerulonephritis, diabetic nephropathy, malignant nephrosclerosis, thrombic microangiopathic syndrome, transplant rejections and glomerulopathy; fibrotic diseases, such as cirrhosis of the liver, mesangial cell proliferative diseases, arteriosclerosis, injuries to nerve tissue, and for inhibiting the reocclusion of vessels after balloon catheter treatment, in vascular prosthetics or after mechanical devices are used to keep vessels open, such as, e.g., stents, as immunosuppressive agents, as a support in scar-free healing, in senile keratosis and in contact dermatitis have also been reported in WO 04/13102.<br>
There is, however, a desire to produce compounds that are as efficaceous as possible in as broad a range of indications as possible. A constant blockade of VEGF mediated signal transduction is desirable in order to reduce persistant angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. Suitable compounds for longer term<br><br>
treatment should exhibit little or no drug-drug interaction potential. The Cytochrome P450 isoenzymes play a pivotal role in the degradation of pharmaceutical agents. The problem is also complicated by the fact that patients may express different relative amounts of the isoenzymes. An inhibition of these isoenzymes may result in undesirable pharmaceutical agent interactions, especially in the case of multimorbid patients (patients with multiple disease conditions). For example, inhibition of the Cytochrome P450 isoenzymes responsible for metabolisation of the parent agent could lead to toxic systemic concentrations. A further problem exists in combination therapy with other medications, whereby inhibition of the Cytochrome P450 isoenzymes responsible for metabolising the co-medications could lead to toxic systemic concentrations of the co-medication. This is especially the case for co-administered cytostatics in the case of cancer therapy.<br>
Thus, it has now surprisingly been found that compounds of general formula (I), as described below, have more advantageous physico-chemical and/or pharmacokinetic properties and prevent, for example, tyrosine phosphorylation or stop persistent angiogenesis and thus the growth and propagation of tumors, whereby they are distinguished in particular by a potent inhibition of VEGF receptor kinases and a reduced potential for drug-drug interactions, specifically a reduced inhibition of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes 2C9 and 2C19.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) are thus suitable, for example, for the treatment or prevention of diseases for which an inhibition of angiogenesis and/or the VEGF receptor kinases is beneficial.<br>
In one aspect of the invention, there is provided an anthranilamide pyridinurea compound of formula (I) :<br><br>

The compounds of formula (I) can be used as pharmaceutical agents based on their inhibitory activity relative to the phosphorylation of VEGF receptors. Based on their profile of action, the compounds according to the invention are suitable for preventing or treating diseases that are caused or promoted by persistent angiogenesis.<br>
Since the compounds of formula (I) are identified as inhibitors of the tyrosine kinases VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, they are suitable in particular for preventing or treating those diseases that are caused or promoted by persistent angiogenesis that is triggered via the VEGF receptor or by an increase in vascular permeability.<br>
The present invention also provides the use of the compounds of formula (I) as inhibitors of the tyrosine kinases VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, or KDR and FLT.<br>
The term "diseases that are caused or promoted by persistent angiogenesis" relates especially to diseases such as tumor or metastasis growth, psoriasis, Kaposi's sarcoma, restenosis, such as, e.g., stent-induced restenosis, endometriosis, Crohn's disease, Hodgkin's disease, leukemia; arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis, hemangioma, angiofibroma; eye diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, neovascular glaucoma; corneal transplants; renal diseases, such as glomerulonephritis, diabetic nephropathy, malignant nephrosclerosis, thrombic microangiopathic syndrome, transplant rejections and glomerulopathy; fibrotic diseases, such as cirrhosis of the liver, mesangial cell proliferative diseases, arteriosclerosis, injuries to nerve tissue, and for inhibiting the reocclusion of vessels after balloon catheter treatment, in vascular prosthetics or after mechanical devices are used to keep vessels open, such as, e.g., stents, as immunosuppressive agents, for supporting scar-free healing, in senile keratosis, in contact dermatitis, and in asthma.<br>
In treating injuries to nerve tissue, quick scar formation on the injury sites can be prevented with the compounds according to the invention, i.e., scar formation is prevented from occurring before the axons reconnect. A reconstruction of the nerve compounds can thus be facilitated.<br>
The formation of ascites in patients, especially patients suffering from tumors caused by metastases, can also be suppressed with the compounds according to the invention. VEGF-induced oedemas can also be suppressed.<br>
By a treatment with the compounds of formula (I), not only a reduction of the size of metastases but also a reduction of the number of metastases can be achieved.<br>
Lymphangiogenesis plays an important role in lymphogenic metastasis (Karpanen, T. et al, Cancer Res. 2001 Mar 1, 61(5): 1786-90, Veikkola, T., et al., EMBO J. 2001, Mar 15; 20(6): 1223-31).<br>
The compounds of formula (I) also show excellent action as VEGFR kinase 3 inhibitors and are, therefore, also suitable as effective inhibitors of lymphangiogenesis.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) are thus effective in the prevention or treatment of diseases that are associated with excessive lymphangiogenesis, such as lymphedema, lymphangiectasia, lymphangioma, and lymphangiosarcoma but also asthma. Lymphatic growth around tumors may facilitate metastatic spread of malignant cells that ultimately kill the patient. This process can be effectively hindered by the compounds of this invention. Thus the compounds are not only effective in inhibiting metastasis growth, but can also be effective in reducing the number of metastases.<br>
This invention also provides the use of the compounds of formula (I) as inhibitors of the tyrosine kinase VEGFR-3 (FLT-4).<br>
A further object of this invention is also a pharmaceutical agent for preventing or treating diseases that are associated with excessive lymphangiogenesis, such<br>
as metastasis growth, lymphedema, lymphangiectasia, lymphangioma, and lymphangiosarcoma but also asthma.<br>
Furthermore, the invention relates to the use of the compounds of general formula (1) for the preparation of a pharmaceutical agent for use in or for the prevention or treatment of tumor or metastasis growth, psoriasis, Kaposi's sarcoma, restenosis, such as, e.g., stent-induced restenosis, endometriosis, Crohn's disease, Hodgkin's disease, leukemia; arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis, hemangioma, angiofibroma; eye diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, neovascular glaucoma; corneal transplants; renal diseases, such as glomerulonephritis, diabetic nephropathy, malignant nephrosclerosis, thrombic microangiopathic syndrome, transplant rejections and glomerulopathy; fibrotic diseases, such as cirrhosis of the liver, mesangial cell proliferative diseases, arteriosclerosis, injuries to nerve tissue, and for inhibiting the reocclusion of vessels after balloon catheter treatment, in vascular prosthetics or after mechanical devices are used to keep vessels open, such as, e.g., stents, as immunosuppressive agents, for supporting scar-free healing, in senile keratosis, in contact dermatitis, and also in asthma.<br>
To use the compounds of formula (I) as pharmaceutical agents, the latter are brought into the form of a pharmaceutical preparation, which in addition to the active ingredient for enteral or parenteral administration contains suitable pharmaceutical, organic or inorganic inert carrier materials, such as, for example, water, gelatin, gurn arable, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, talc, vegetable oils, polyalkylene glycols, etc. The pharmaceutical preparations can be present in solid form, for example as tablets, coated tablets, suppositories, capsules or in liquid form, for example as solutions, suspensions or emulsions. They also can contain, moreover, adjuvants such as preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents or emulsifiers, salts for changing osmotic pressure or buffers.<br>
For parenteral administration, especially injection solutions or suspensions, especially aqueous solutions of the active compounds in polyhydroxyethoxylated castor oil, are suitable.<br>
As carrier systems, surface-active adjuvants such as salts of bile acids or animal or plant phospholipids, but also mixtures thereof as well as liposomes or components thereof can also be used.<br>
For oral administration, especially tablets, coated tablets or capsules with talc and/or hydrocarbon vehicles or binders, such as for example, lactose, corn starch or potato starch, are suitable. The administration can also be carried out in liquid form, such as, for example, as juice, to which optionally a sweetener or, if necessary, one or more flavouring substances, is added.<br>
The dosage of the active ingredients can vary depending on the method of administration, age and weight of the patient, type and severity of the disease to be treated and similar factors. The daily dose is 0.5-1000 mg, preferably 50-200 mg, whereby the dose can be given as a single dose to be administered once or divided into 2 or more daily doses.<br>
A further object of this invention is therefore a pharmaceutical agent comprising a compound of formula (I) in combination with at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) are obtained, in that a compound of general formula (II): (Figure Removed)    or general formula (I) and M stands for halogen, is (i) first converted to an amine and then, by reaction with a carbamoyl chloride of formula CICONR2R3 in which R2 and R3 are defined supra as for general formula (I), is converted to a urea of general formula (I), or (ii) reacted with a urea of general formula HiNCONR2R3 in which R2 and R3 are defined supra as for general formula (I), or (iii) first converted to an amine, then converted to a compound of formula (I) by first reacting with a compound of formula CICOzPh and then reacting with a compound of formula HNR2R3, wherein R2 and R3 are defined supra as for general formula (I); or a compound of general formula (III) in which A, E, Q, W, X, R2, and R3 are defined supra as for general formula (I) and RY stands for H or CrC6-alkyl, is reacted with an amine of general formula R1NH2 in which R1 is defined supra as for general formula (I),<br>

There are many methods known to the person skilled in the art in the literature for amide formation. For example, it is possible to start from the corresponding<br>
ester. The ester may be reacted according to J. Org. Chem. 1995, 8414 with trimethylalumimum and the corresponding amine in solvents such as toluene or 1,2-dichloroethane, at temperatures of 0Â°C to the boiling point of the solvent. If the molecule contains two ester groups, both are converted into the same amide. Instead of trimethylaluminium, sodium hexamethyldisilazide can also be used.<br>
For amide formation, however, all processes that are known to the person skilled in the art from peptide chemistry are also available. For example, the corresponding acid, obtained from the corresponding ester by saponification, can be reacted with the amine in aprotic polar solvents, such as, for example, dimethylformamide, via an activated acid derivative, obtainable, for example, with hydroxybenzotriazole and a carbodiimide, such as, for example, diisopropylcarbodiimide, at temperatures of between 0Â°C and the boiling point of the solvent, preferably at 80Â°C, or else with preformed reagents, such as, for example, HATU (0-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate) (Chem. Comm. 1994, 201), at temperatures of between 0Â°C and the boiling point of the solvent, preferably at room temperature. The addition of a base such as N-methylmorpholine, for example, is necessary. Amide formation, may also be accomplished via the acid halide, mixed acid anhydride, imidazolide or azide.<br>
The ureas of aryl- or heteroaryl amines may be prepared by a variety of literature known methods, known to the person skilled in the art. For example, they may be prepared by the reaction of aryl- or heteroaryl amines with isocyanates, the reaction of amines with aryl- or heteroaryl-carbamates such as aryl- or heteroaryl-phenoxycarbamates, or the reaction of aryl- or heteroaryl amines with appropriately substituted carbamoyl chlorides, or the reaction of an aryl- or heteroaryl-halide with ureas under the influence of metal catalysis.<br><br>
For example, the ureas of aminopyridines may be prepared by reacting a urea with halopyridines, whereby chloro and bromopyridines are preferred, under the catalytic influence of metal complexes, for example, palladium- or copper complexes. In the case of copper complexes the use of stoichiometric amounts of the copper complexes may be advantageous for the reaction outcome. Suitable copper salts for the reaction are copper (I) or copper (II) salts whereby copper (I) salts such as, for example, copper (I) oxide or copper (I) iodide, are preferred. In the case of copper (I) iodide the addition of an additive such as, for example, ethytenediamine is necessary. Suitable solvents for this copper promoted coupling are dioxane or dimethylformamide, at temperatures upto the boiling point of the solvents, whereby 120 Â°C is preferred. Addition of a base is also necessary, such as potassium phosphate or caesium carbonate. In the case of palladium catalysis, palladium complexes such as tris-(dibenzylideneacetone) -dipalladium(O) maybe employed. Suitable solvents for the reaction are toluene, dioxane or dimethylformamide, whereby mixtures of solvents may also be advantageous for the reaction, at temperatures from room temperature to the boiling points of the solvents, whereby 110Â°C is preferred. A co-ligand such as BINAP, DPPF or xantphos is also employed. A base is also required, suitable bases for the reaction are for example, cesium carbonate, potassium phosphate or sodium tert-butoxide.<br>
The required urea starting materials for the above copper or palladium promoted coupling, may in turn be prepared from the reaction of the corresponding amines with the corresponding isocyanates. Solvents such as for example dichloromethane, or isopropylalcohol may be employed at temperatures from 0Â°C to the boiling points of the solvents, whereby room temperature is preferred.<br>
Methods for the preparation of substituted or unsubstituted 6-aminoindazoles are well known to the person skilled in the art, in the literature. They may be obtained from the reduction of the corresponding nitroindazoles via catalytic<br><br>
hydrogenation or other well known reduction methods. N-alkylation of<br>
substituted nitroindazoles may be accomplished with a variety of literature<br>
known alkylating agents. For example, methylation of N-1 or N-2 of a suitably<br>
functionalised 6-nitroindazole may be accomplished by for example treatment<br>
with a base, preferably Cs2C03 or NaH, and a methyl halide, preferably methyl<br>
iodide in a suitable solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide, at temperatures<br>
ranging from 0 Â°C to 50 Â°C, whereby 50 Â°C is preferred. 3-Substituted-6-<br>
nitroindazoles may be prepared by a variety of methods. For example alkyl<br>
substituents may be introduced in the 3-position by way of standard Suzuki<br>
reactions between an appropriate 3-haloindazole, whereby the appropriate 3-<br>
iodoindazoles are preferred, and an alkyl boronic acid, whereby the<br>
trialkylboraxines may also be employed. N-protection of the indazole may be<br>
advantageous for the reaction. 6-Nitroindazole-3-carboxylic acid provides a<br>
suitable starting material for ester, amide, hydroxymethyl and alkoxymethyl<br>
substitution in the 3-position of 6-nitroindazole, via well known transformations<br>
such as transesterification, amide coupling, reduction, or reduction followed by<br>
alkylation. 6-Nitroindazole-3-carbaldehyde (prepared by the reaction of<br>
commercial 6-nitroindole with NaNCh in the presence of dilute aqueous<br>
hydrochloric acid according to J. Med. Chem. 2001, 44, 7, 1021) provides a<br>
useful precursor to 6-nitroindazole-3-carboxylic acid via well known oxidation<br>
methods. In turn 6-nitroindazole-3-carbaldehyde may also be converted to<br>
3-hydroxymethyl-6-nitroindazole,	3-alkoxymethyl-6-nitroindazole,	or<br>
3-aminomethyl-6-nitroindazole derivatives by equally standard transformations such as reduction, reduction followed by alkylation, or reductive amination. Such standard transformations may also be applied to the synthesis of other substituted aminoindazoles. A variety of substituted nitroindazoles are commercially available, however they may be readily synthesised via the reaction of a suitable 2-amino-nitrotoluene derivative with, for example, NaNOz and aqueous hydrochloric acid. If required, the nitro group may be introduced after the cyclisation reaction of a suitable 2-aminotoluene derivative by standard nitration chemistry.<br><br>
The preparation of N-alkylated-aminobenzimidazoles may be accomplished from the corresponding N-alkylated-nitrobenzimidazoles via standard reduction chemistry. Alkylation of a suitable functionalised nitrobenzimidazole, for example with an alkyl halide and a base, furnishes N1- and N3-alkylated-nitrobenzimidazoles, which may be separated and isolated in pure form by standard purification techniques. For example, 6-amino-1-methyl-benzimidazole may be produced by the reaction of commercial 5-nitrobenzimidazole with Mel and CsiCOj in DMF followed by purification (of the resulting mixture of 5- and 6-nitro-l-methyl-benzimidazoles) and hydrogenation in the presence of 10% Pd on charcoal. Similarly, the preparation of N-alkylated-aminobenzotriazoles may also be accomplished from the corresponding nitrobenzotriazoles. Alkylation of a suitable functionalised nitrobenzotriazole, for example with an alkyl halide and a base, furnishes N1-, N2- and N3-alkylated-nitrobenzotriazoles, which may be separated and isolated in pure form by standard purification techniques. Standard reduction chemistry furnishes the corresponding aminobenzotriazoles. For example, 5-amino-2-methyl-benzotnazole may be prepared according to a literature procedure (Eur. J. Med. Chem. 1992, 27, 161-166).<br>
The preparation of 3-aminoisoquinolines which are substituted in the 7-position, may be accomplished via the corresponding 3-amino-1-bromo-7-substituted isoquinoline by way of reductive dehalogenation. 3-amino-1-bromo-7-substituted isoquinolines may in turn be prepared by the reaction of a suitable 2-cyano-4-substituted-benzeneacetonitrile with HBr in acetic acid. For example, 3-amino-7-methoxyisoquinoline may be prepared in two steps (HBr mediated cyclisation followed by reductive dehalogenation) from 2-cyano-4-methoxy-benzeneacetonitrile, which may be prepared according to a literature procedure (Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1980, 53, 10, 2885-2890).<br><br>
1-Alkyl-6-amino-quinolin-2-ones may be prepared by known methods. For example, 6-amino-2-methyl-quinolin-2-one may be prepared according to a literature procedure (J. Chem. Research, Synopses, 1997, 310-311).<br>
2-Amino-3,6-disubstituted quinolines may be prepared by a number of procedures. For example, the reaction of the lithium salt (generated with a base such as lithium diisopropylamide) of a suitably substituted cyanomethyl-dialkylphosphonate with a suitably substituted 2-nitrobenzaldehyde derivative in a suitable solvent, such as THF, furnishes a suitable acrylonitrile derivative which may be cyclised to the desired 2-amino-3,6-disubstituted quinoline by treating with a suitable reducing agent, such as iron in acetic acid.<br>
