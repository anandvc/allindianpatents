STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH<br>
The work with the non-human primate cells described<br>
below was supported by a grant with United States<br>
government support awarded by the following agency: NIH<br>
RR11571. The United States has certain rights in this<br>
invention. No U.S. government funds were used for the<br>
work with human cells described herein.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Undifferentiated primate embryonic stem ("ES") cells<br>
can be cultured indefinitely and yet maintain the<br>
potential to form differentiated cells of the body. See<br>
U.S. patent 5,843,780; J. Thomson, et al., 282 Science<br>
1145-1147 (1998); and J. Thomson, et al., 38 Biology 133-<br>
165 (1998). The disclosure of these publications and of<br>
all other publications referred to herein are<br>
incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.<br>
Primate ES cells thus provide an exciting new model<br>
for understanding the differentiation and function of<br>
human tissue, and offer new strategies for drug discovery<br>
and testing. They also promise new therapies based on<br>
the transplantation of ES cell-derived tissues. For<br>
example, human and rhesus monkey ES cells injected into<br>
immunocompromised mice form benign teratomas with<br>
advanced differentiated derivatives representing all<br>
three embryonic germ layers. Easily identified<br>
differentiated cells in human ES cell teratomas include<br>
smooth muscle, striated muscle, bone, cartilage, gut and<br>
respiratory epithelium, keratinizing squamous epithelium,<br>
hair, neural epithelium, and ganglia.<br>
Human and non-human primate ES cell lines provide a<br>
particularly powerful new model for understanding normal<br>
human development and thus also for understanding<br><br>
abnormal human development. Because of the potential<br>
risk to the resulting child, experimental manipulation of<br>
the post-implantation human embryo is ethically<br>
unacceptable and as a result functional studies on human<br>
embryos are lacking. Consequently, what is known about<br>
human development in the early post-implantation period<br>
is based almost entirely on static histological sections<br>
of a few human embryos and on analogy to experimental<br>
embryology studies of the mouse.<br>
However, early mouse and primate development differ<br>
significantly. For example, human and mouse embryos<br>
differ in the timing of embryonic genome expression, in<br>
the formation, structure, and function of the fetal<br>
membranes and placenta and in the formation of an<br>
embryonic disc instead of an egg cylinder. The earliest<br>
events of human development are critically involved in<br>
human infertility, pregnancy loss, and birth defects.<br>
Primate ES cells offer a new window for understanding<br>
these early human developmental events and for<br>
understanding the pathogenesis of developmental failures.<br>
Primate ES cells also provide a potentially<br>
unlimited source of differentiated, euploid, non-<br>
transformed cells for investigators interested in the<br>
normal function and pathology of specific differentiated<br>
primate cells. Such purified populations of specific ES<br>
cell-derived cells will also likely be useful for drug<br>
discovery, toxicity screens, and will provide a source of<br>
cells for transplantation.<br>
For tissues such as the heart that completely lack a<br>
tissue-specific stem cell, primate ES cells will prove<br>
even more valuable. Primate ES cells also offer the<br>
promise of new transplantation therapies. When disease<br>
results from the destruction or dysfunction of a limited<br>
number of cell types, such as in Parkinson"s disease<br>
(dopaminergic neurons), or juvenile onset diabetes<br><br>
mellitus (pancreatic ?-islet cells) , the replacement of<br>
those specific cell types by ES cell derivatives could<br>
offer potentially life long treatment.<br>
To accomplish these goals, it is desirable to more<br>
efficiently differentiate ES cells to specific lineages.<br>
Considerable progress in causing non-primate ES cell<br>
differentiation to neural, hematopoietic, and cardiac<br>
tissue has been made. See e.g. T. Doetschman, et al. , 87<br>
J. Embry. And Exper. Morph. 27-45 (1985); G. Keller, 7<br>
Current Op. In Cell Biol. 862-869 (1995); U.S. patent<br>
5,914,2 68. In each of these examples, ES cells were<br>
first formed into "embryoid bodies", three-dimensional ES<br>
cell aggregates that facilitate subsequent<br>
differentiation.<br>
However, analogous experiments on primate ES cells<br>
demonstrated that embryoid body formation by conventional<br>
murine protocols fail. In such conventional protocols ES<br>
cells are dispersed to single cells, and either allowed<br>
to aggregate into embryoid bodies under conditions that<br>
prevent cell attachment to the substrate, or the ES cells<br>
are allowed to grow into embryoid bodies from single<br>
cells or clusters suspended in methylcellulose. We have<br>
learned that primate ES cells die rapidly when dispersed<br>
to single cells if attachment is prevented, so they do<br>
not successfully aggregate, and they therefore do not<br>
grow out from clones in methylcellulose.<br>
It can therefore be seen that a need exists for<br>
improved methods for producing primate embryoid bodies,<br>
and differentiated cells derived therefrom.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a method for<br>
producing primate embryoid bodies from colonies of<br>
primate embryonic stem cells that are adhering to a<br>
substrate. One removes the adhering colonies of the<br>
embryonic stem cells from the substrate in clumps. One<br><br>
then incubates the clumps in a container under conditions<br>
in which the clumps are essentially inhibited from<br>
attaching to the container and coalesce into embryoid<br>
bodies. For purposes of this application, a clump is a<br>
grouping of two or more stem cells, preferably a clump<br>
large enough to be visible to the naked eye.<br>
In one preferred form the removal step is in the<br>
presence of an agent that promotes disassociation of the<br>
clumps from the substrate as clumps. A purely chemical<br>
agent such as Versene® calcium disodium EDTA chelating<br>
agent can be used. However, more preferred is a<br>
proteinase that preferentially acts on the extra cellular<br>
matrix such as dispase, collagenase, catalase,<br>
neuraminidase, pancreatin, pancreatic elastase or<br>
trypsin. If trypsin is used the removal step must be<br>
conducted quickly and at relatively low concentrations in<br>
order to prevent the trypsin from also destroying the<br>
clumps. Enzyme EDTA mixes can also be used to advantage.<br>
In another form the removal step involves<br>
mechanically scraping the clumps from the substrate as<br>
clumps.<br>
In another aspect the incubation step can be<br>
conducted by agitating the container (e.g. by gently<br>
rocking, shaking, or vibrating it), the container for the<br>
incubation step can be a non-attaching bacterial grade<br>
culture plastic, and/or the incubation step can be in the<br>
presence of a serum-free medium which lacks serum<br>
attachment factors.<br>
In another aspect the invention provides primate<br>
embryoid bodies that have, been derived (directly or<br>
indirectly) using the above methods.<br>
In still another aspect the invention provides<br>
differentiated cells derived (directly or indirectly)<br>
from the embryoid bodies.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, primate ES<br><br>
cells that have been cultured under standard conditions<br>
(see e.g. U.S. patent 5,843,780) are permitted to<br>
overgrow, pile up and/or otherwise closely associate in<br>
clumps on a substrate (e.g. a plastic tissue culture<br>
plate with standard feeder layer). They are then removed<br>
as clumps from the substrate (e.g. by incubating the<br>
colonies with an enzyme which attacks the ES cell<br>
colony"s attachment to the substrate more strongly than<br>
ES cell attachments with ES cells). In such a case the<br>
enzyme could be dispase at a concentration of about 10<br>
mg/ml.<br>
Alternatively, the clumps could be removed as clumps<br>
by mechanically scraping with a micropipette, cell<br>
scraper, or the like.<br>
The essentially intact colonies are then incubated<br>
under non-attaching conditions (preferably continuous<br>
rocking of the culture dish, culture on non-attaching<br>
bacterial grade culture plastic, and/or continuous<br>
culture in the presence of serum-free medium which lacks<br>
serum attachment factors). The colonies can then quickly<br>
coalesce into compact embryoid bodies, which can<br>
thereafter be allowed to differentiate either in<br>
continuous suspension, or after re-attachment to a<br>
substrate. Such embryoid bodies can be used to derive<br>
differentiated derivatives of endoderm, mesoderm, and<br>
ectoderm, and for obtaining other desired lineages.<br>
It is an advantage of the present invention that it<br>
provides effective methods of forming primate embryoid<br>
bodies from primate embryonic stem cell lines. Another<br>
advantage of the present invention is to provide primate<br>
embryoid bodies suitable for differentiation into other<br>
primate cell types. Other features and advantages of the<br>
present invention will become apparent after study of the<br>
specification and claims which follow.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Formation Of Embryoid Bodies<br>
Primate embryonic stem cells (e.g. rhesus or human -<br>
U.S. patent 5,843,780; J. Thomson, et al., 282 Science<br>
1145-1147 (1998)) are cultured on mitotically inactivated<br>
(3000 rads g-radiation) mouse embryonic fibroblasts,<br>
prepared at 5x104 cells/cm2 on tissue culture plastic<br>
previously treated by overnight incubation with 0.1%<br>
gelatin. E. Robertson, Embryo-derived Stem Cell Lines.<br>
In: Teratocarcinomas And. Embryonic Stem Cells: A<br>
Practical Approach IRL Press: Washington, D.C., 71-112<br>
(1987). Culture medium consists of 79% Dulbecco"s<br>
modified Eagle medium (DMEM; 4500 mg of glucose per<br>
liter; without sodium pyruvate) , 20% fetal bovine serum<br>
(FBS), 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM L-glutamine and 1%<br>
nonessential amino acid stock (GIBCO).<br>
One allows colonies to form clumps over a period of<br>
hours. ES cell colonies can then be removed from the<br>
tissue culture plate using physical or chemical methods<br>
that keep the ES cells in clumps.<br>
For dispase or collagenase removal of ES cell<br>
colonies from the culture plate, the culture medium is<br>
removed from the ES cells. Dispase (10 mg/ml in ES<br>
culture medium) or collagenase (1 mg/ml solution in DMEM<br>
or other basal medium) is added to the culture plate. The<br>
culture plates are returned to the incubator for 10-15<br>
minutes.<br>
After dispase treatment the colonies can either be<br>
washed off the culture dishes or will become free of the<br>
tissue culture plate with gentle agitation. After<br>
collagenase treatment the cells can be scraped off the<br>
culture dish with a 5 ml glass pipette. Some dissociation<br>
of the colonies occurs, but this is not sufficient to<br>
individualize the cells. After chemical removal of the<br>
cells from the tissue culture plate, the cell suspension<br><br>
is centrifuged gently for 5 minutes, the supernatant is<br>
removed and discarded, the cells are rinsed, and the<br>
cells are resuspended in culture medium with or without<br>
serum.<br>
Mechanical removal of the cells is achieved by using<br>
a pulled glass pipette to scrape the cells from the<br>
culture plate. Cell clumps can be immediately<br>
resuspended, without centrifugation, in fresh tissue<br>
culture medium.<br>
Once colonies are removed from the tissue culture<br>
plate, the ES cells should remain in suspension during<br>
further embryoid body formation. This can be achieved<br>
by, for example, gently and continuously rocking the cell<br>
suspension. Cell suspensions are aliquoted into wells of<br>
6-well tissue culture dishes, placed inside a sealed,<br>
humidified isolation chamber, gassed with 5% CO2, 5%O2 and<br>
90%N2 and placed on a rocker (Red Rocker, Hoefer<br>
Scientific Instruments). The rocker is housed inside an<br>
incubator maintained at 37°C. The culture plates can be<br>
rocked continuously for at least 4 8 hours and up to 14<br>
days.<br>
Every 2 days the plates are removed from the rocking<br>
device, the culture medium is removed, and fresh culture<br>
medium is added to the cells. The culture dishes are then<br>
returned to the rocking environment. Cells will also<br>
remain in suspension when cultured in suspension culture<br>
dishes (Nunc) without rocking, or when cultured in the<br>
absence of serum, which provides attachment factors. All<br>
cells must be cultured at 37°C, in a humidified,<br>
controlled gas atmosphere (either 5% CO2, 5% O2 and 90% N2<br>
or 5% CO2 in air).<br>
Following culture in suspension for up to 11 days,<br>
embryoid bodies are dispensed by mechanical or chemical<br>
means and can be allowed to reattach to tissue culture<br>
plates treated with gelatin or matrix, in ES medium.<br><br>
Displaced, plated embryoid bodies will form flattened<br>
monolayers and can be maintained by replacing medium<br>
every 2 days.<br>
Analysis Of Embryoid Bodies And Differentiated Cells<br>
We used immunofluorescent antibody staining up to 7<br>
days after plating to confirm the existence of cells of<br>
the neural phenotype. Cells were fixed in 30%<br>
methanol/10% acetic acid before incubation with<br>
antibodies. Antibodies that were used are as follows:<br>
rabbit anti-bovine GFAP (DAKO), anti-Forse-1<br>
(Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) , anti-bovine MAP-2<br>
(Roche), anti-human NCAM/CD56 (DAKO) and anti-01<br>
(provided by S.-C. Zhang, University of Wisconsin). All<br>
primary antibodies are mouse monoclonals except anti-<br>
GFAP. Secondary antibodies, FITC-conjugated goat anti-<br>
mouse IgG and biotin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit, as well<br>
as AMCA-conjugated streptavidin were purchased from<br>
Jackson ImmunoResearch.<br>
The Forse-1 antibody recognizes phosphacan, a brain-<br>
specific chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan that binds<br>
neural cell adhesion molecules in the embryonic CNS of<br>
both humans and rodents. K. Allendorfer et al. , 6 Mol.<br>
And Cell. Neuro. 381-395 (1995); S. Tole et. al. , 15 J.<br>
Neuro. 957-969 (1995). The 01 antibody identifies pro-<br>
oligodendrocytes present from day 3 in embryonic mouse<br>
brain cultures. M. Schachner et. al. , 83 Dev. Biol. 328-<br>
338 (1981); I. Sommer, et al., 83 Dev. Biol. 311-327<br>
(1981).<br>
Within three days of plating, the neural precursors,<br>
stained by Forse-1 and 01, were observed. The Forse-1<br>
antibody stained numerous rounded cells, whereas very<br>
sparse, flattened cells with extensive projections were<br>
stained with the anti-01 antibody.<br>
Neurons and glial were detected, 3 days and later<br>
after plating, by positive staining of neural cell<br><br>
adhesion molecule (NCAM)/CD56 (Figure 3), microtubule-<br>
associated protein-2 (MAP-2) (Figure 3), ?III-tubulin and<br>
glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). NCAM is a cell<br>
adhesion molecule thought to be important in cell-cell<br>
interactions within the neuroepithelium. B. Cunningham,<br>
et al., 236 Science 799-806 (1987); J. Ritz, et al., 42<br>
Adv. Immuno. 181-211 (1988). MAP-2 plays an important<br>
role in brain microtubule assembly. ?III-tubulin is a<br>
neuron-specific marker, and glial fibrillary acidic<br>
protein (GFAP) is an astrocyte marker.<br>
Differentiation Into Lineages<br>
Embryoid bodies can be differentiated into a variety<br>
of desired lineages. For example the embryoid bodies<br>
could be used to derive hematopoietic cells using<br>
techniques analogous to those used for mouse in M. Wiles<br>
et al. 111 Development 259-267 (1991). In this regard<br>
one could plate the embryoid bodies in serum-containing<br>
medium in the presence of 2 i.u./ml erythropoietin or IL-<br>
3.<br>
If cardiac lineages are desired one could use<br>
techniques analogous to T. Doetschman et al., 87 J.<br>
Embry. Exper. Morph. 27-45 (1985). One could plate the<br>
bodies in serum-containing medium with no additives.<br>
To develop neural lineages one could plate the<br>
embryoid bodies in the presence of 20 ng/ml fibroblast<br>
growth factor plus 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor.<br>
This is analogous to techniques described in B. Reynolds<br>
et al., 255 Science 5052 (1992) .<br>
The present invention thus provides an effective<br>
method for making primate embryoid bodies from primate ES<br>
cells. While the above work was focused on rhesus and<br>
human embryonic stem cells (and neural cells derived<br>
therefrom via these embryoid bodies), the techniques<br>
described herein should work broadly for primate<br>
embryonic stem cells and other cell types. Further,<br><br>
while specific techniques for clump removal have been<br>
discussed, the invention is not limited to those<br>
alone. Rather, other techniques for removing the calls<br>
in clumps from the substrate should work.<br>
Thus the invention is not limited to the specific<br>
embodiments described herein. Rather, the claim should<br>
be looked to in order to judge the full scope of the<br>
invention.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
The present invention provides a supply of human<br>
and other primate embryoid bodies suitable for<br>
research, medical purposes, and differentiation into<br>
lineages. The present invention does not encompass<br>
reproductive cloning methodologies used to produce /<br>
manufacture human or animals. The invention does,<br>
however, include therapeutic (cellular) cloning useful<br>
for drug discovery, toxicity screens, and<br>
transplantation, which includes providing cells used<br>
to treat for example, life-threatening cancers and<br>
blood disorders, such as leukemia.<br><br>
We claim:<br>
1. A method for producing primate embryoid bodies<br>
from colonies of primate embryonic stem cells that are<br>
adhering to a substrate, the method comprising:<br>
removing the adhering colonies of the embryonic stem<br>
cells from the substrate in clumps; and<br>
then incubating the clumps in a container under<br>
conditions in which the clumps are essentially inhibited<br>
from attaching to the container and coalesce into<br>
embryoid bodies.<br>
2. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the removal step<br>
is conducted in the presence of an enzyme that promotes<br>
disassociation of the clumps as clumps from the substrate.<br>
3. The method as claimed in claim 2, wherein the enzyme is<br>
dispase.<br>
4. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the removal step<br>
is conducted in the presence of a chelating agent.<br>
5. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the removal step<br>
comprises mechanically scraping the clumps from the<br>
substrate.<br>
6. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the removal step<br>
is conducted in the presence of trypsin, calcium and<br>
magnesium.<br>
7. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the incubation<br>
step comprises agitating the container.<br>
8. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the incubation<br>
step is conducted in a container made of plastic.<br>
9. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the incubation<br>
step is conducted in the presence of a serum-free medium.<br>
10. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the primate<br>
embryonic stem cells are human embryonic stem cells and<br>
the primate embryoid bodies are human embryoid bodies.<br>
Primate embryoid bodies are formed from primate ES cells. The ES cells form clumps. One then removes the<br>
clumps, as clumps, and permits incubation under non-adherent conditions. The development of embryoid bodies from primate ES<br>
cells is dependent on maintaining the aggregation of cells, as individualized cells will rapidly die.</td>
