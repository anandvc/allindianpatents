Description<br>
Hot-gas-ducting housing element, protective shaft jacket and<br>
gas turbi nc system<br>
The present invention relates to a hot-gas-ducting housing<br>
element for a hot-gas-ducting housing, which element can be<br>
arranged particularly in a gas turbine system around a turbine<br>
rotor of the gas turbine system and serves to conduct a hot<br>
gas to a turbine part of the gas turbine system. The present<br>
invention relates further to a protective shaft jacket of the<br>
hot -gas- ducting housing, which jacket is embodied for<br>
surrounding the turbine rotor of the gas turbine system. The<br>
present invention relates finally to the hot-gas-ducting<br>
housing itself and to a gas turbine system having a hot-gas-<br>
ducting housing.<br>
A qas turbine system 1 essentially comprises one or more<br>
combustion chambers 3 (see Fig. 1) in which a fuel is burned,<br>
a turbine b to which the combustion exhaust gases that are hot<br>
and under pressure are ducted from the combustion chambers 3<br>
and in which the exhaust gases perform work, while cooling and<br>
expanding and thereby cause the turbine 5 to rotate, and a<br>
compressor 7 that is coupled to the turbine 5 via a shaft 15<br>
and via which the air necessary for combustion is taken in and<br>
compressed to a higher pressure.<br>
Hot-gas-conducting housings are employed in gas turbine<br>
systems for ducting the hot combustion exhaust gases. That<br>
applies particularly to gas turbine systems of the kind in<br>
which what are termed silo combustion chambers arc used that<br>
are as a rule arranged on both sides of the turbine. Fig. .1<br>
shows a schematic view of a gas turbine system of said type,<br>
PCT/EP2006/063825 / 2004P18721WOUS<br>
2<br>
with Fig. 1a showing a horizontal and Fig. 1b a vertical<br>
section through the system. The combustion exhaust gases 2<br>
flow out of said silo combustion chambers 3 in a direction<br>
substantially perpendicular to the rotational, axis A of the<br>
turbine b. Arranged between the outlet 18 of the silo<br>
combustion chambers and the turbine 5 is a mixer housing 8 to<br>
which on the turbine side is joined an inner housing 9 located<br>
inside the gas turbine housing 2. The function of the inner<br>
housing 9 is to protect the surrounding components from heat<br>
and redirect the hot gases exiting the mixer housing 8 toward<br>
the turbine. On exiting the inner housing 9, which means on<br>
entering the turbine 5 of the gas turbine system 1, the<br>
combustion exhaust gases then flow substantially parallel to<br>
the rotational axis A of the turbine shaft 12.<br>
Hot-gas-conducting housings, and in particular the described<br>
inner housings in gas turbine systems having silo combustion<br>
chambers, are thermally highly stressed components. For that<br>
reason measures are taken to cool the hot-gas-ducting surfaces<br>
of the housing. Said measures include cooling the regions<br>
particularly under stress by means of a cooling fluid that<br>
flows along the outer side of the walls of said regions in<br>
order to absorb and remove the heat transferred to the hot-<br>
gas-ducting surfaces.<br>
An Inner housing 9, as previously described, has as a rule a<br>
hot-gas-ducting housing element 100 having an inner housing<br>
hub 101. The inner housing hub 101 surrounds a protective<br>
shaft jacket 115 (Fig. 7a) which in turn surrounds the shaft<br>
12. The surface 109 of the inner housing hub 101 facing the<br>
housing interior therein forms the guiding and conducting<br>
surface for the combustion exhaust gases 2, while the surface<br>
104 of the inner housing hub 101 facing away from the housing<br>
PCT/EP2006/063825 / 2004P18721WOUS<br>
3<br>
interior surrounds the protective shaft jacket 115. The inner<br>
housing hub 101 is fixed in position on the protective shaft<br>
jacket. 11b by means of an annular rib 103 arranged centrally<br>
in the axial direction and projecting toward the protective<br>
shaft jacket 115. The protective shaft jacket 115 itself is<br>
secured to the gas turbine housing 2 and has a stud 105 in<br>
which is located an annular groove 106 into which the annular<br>
rib 103 engages. The inner housing hub 101 and protective<br>
shaft jacket 115 are mounted in the gas turbine system jointly<br>
as a unit.<br>
To enable a cooling fluid F to flow from one side of the rib<br>
103 or, as the case may be, of the stud 105 to the other, the<br>
stud 105 has passage openings 107 through which the cooling<br>
fluid can flow (see figures 7a and 7b).<br>
When the hot-gas-ducting housing is operating, the rib 103 is,<br>
however, heated less than the material regions closer to the<br>
hol-gas-ducting surface 109 of the cylindrical inner housing<br>
hub 101. This results in what is termed a ferrule effect that<br>
gives rise to tensions in the material regions of the inner<br>
housing hub 101 that border the rib 103. Cracks can therefore<br>
occur in the material particularly at the locations indicated<br>
by the reference numerals 111.<br>
To reduce the risk of a defect due to cracking, the maximum<br>
number of starts, meaning the number of starts of the gas<br>
turbine system after which an inspection for cracking or a<br>
repair is to be performed, is generally limited, furthermore<br>
the rib was relocated to the region of the inner housing's<br>
opening on the turbine side so as to be located in a thermally<br>
loss stressed region of the inner housing.<br>
PCT/EP2006/063825 / 2004P18721WOUS<br>
4<br>
Compared with said prior art an object of the present<br>
invention is to provide an improved hot-gas-ducting housing<br>
element for a hot-gas-ducting housing of a gas turbine system,<br>
in which element the risk of cracking is reduced and the<br>
number of starts before an inspection or repair can be<br>
increased.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
protective shaft jacket for a hot-gas-ducting housing of a<br>
gas turbine system, which jacket will enable a hot-gas-ducting<br>
housing element to be better fixed in position.<br>
Yet. a further object of the present invention is to provide an<br>
improved housing unit for a gas turbine system.<br>
It is finally an object of the present invention to provide an<br>
improved gas turbine system.<br>
The first object is achieved by means of a hot-gas-ducting<br>
housing element as claimed in claim 1, the second object is<br>
achieved by means of protective shaft jacket as claimed in<br>
claim 8, the third object is achieved by means of a housing<br>
unit as claimed in claim 9, and the fourth object is achieved<br>
by means of a gas turbine system as claimed in claim 11. The<br>
dependent, claims contain advantageous embodiments of the<br>
invention.<br>
An Inventive hot-gas-ducting housing element for a hot-gas-<br>
ducting housing of a gas turbine system having a compressor, a<br>
turbine and a turbine rotor is embodied for surrounding a<br>
protective shaft jacket requiring to be arranged around the<br>
turbine rotor and for ducting a hot gas to the turbine. Said<br>
element includes at least one hot gas inlet orifice, an<br>
PCT/EP2006/063825 / 2004P18721WOUS<br>
5<br>
opening on the turbine side, and a ducting section for ducting-<br>
the hot gas from the at least one hot gas inlet orifice to the<br>
opening on the turbine side. The ducting section has an inner<br>
housing hub that is embodied for surrounding the protective<br>
shaft jacket of the gas turbine system and which extends up to<br>
the opening on the turbine side and has on a circumferential<br>
surface requiring to be arranged facing the protective shaft<br>
jacket a rib that extends entirely or partially in the<br>
circumferential direction along the circumferential surface<br>
and projects beyond it. The inner housing hub can be at least<br>
approximately cylindrical in form and have the shape in<br>
particular of a hollow cylinder, with the circumferential<br>
surface requiring to be arranged facing the protective shaft<br>
jacket then constituting the inner surface of the hollow<br>
cylindor. A rib is arranged in the region of the<br>
circumforcntial surface bordering the opening on the turbine<br>
side. In the inventive hot-gas-ducting housing element, the<br>
rib is provided with cooling fluid channels. The inner housing<br>
hub is additionally or alternatively provided with cooling<br>
fluid channels at least in the region of the rib.<br>
Arranging the rib in the region of the inner housing hub's<br>
ci rcumferontial surface bordering the opening on the turbine<br>
side will enable a cooling fluid to flow largely unimpeded<br>
along the inner housing hub up to the opening on the turbine<br>
side, which alone will improve the possibilities for cooling<br>
the inner housing hub. As a result of the inventive<br>
arrangement of the cooling fluid channels it is now also<br>
possible to improve the cooling possibility in the rib region<br>
by reducing the barrier effect of the rib or improving the<br>
ducting of the cooling fluid in the region of the rib.<br>
The barrier effect on the flow of the cooling fluid can be<br>
PCT/EP2006/063825 / 2004P18721WOUS<br>
6<br>
reduced i f the rib is provided with cooling fluid channels<br>
enabling the cooling fluid to pass through the rib. The flow<br>
of the cooling fluid will therein be especially little impeded<br>
if said cooling fluid channels are arranged in the rib such<br>
that they run close to the circumferential surface of the<br>
inner housing hub virtually parallel to its axial direction.<br>
The cool ing effect can also be improved if the inner housing<br>
hub is provided with cooling fluid channels. They can each<br>
have, for example, an opening on the protective shaft jacket<br>
side, meaning an opening in the circumferential surface<br>
requiring to be arranged facing the protective shaft jacket,<br>
and an opening on the hot gas side, meaning an opening in the<br>
surface ducting the hot gas. In particular a cooling fluid<br>
film can form on the surface, on the hot gas side, of the<br>
inner housing hub if, over their course through the inner<br>
housing hub as viewed from the opening on the protective shaft<br>
jacket side constituting an inlet orifice for the cooling<br>
fluid, the cooling fluid channels have an inclination in the<br>
flow direction of the hot gas requiring to be ducted.<br>
Additionally or alternatively to the cooling fluid channels<br>
provided with openings on the protective shaft jacket side and<br>
hot. gas side there can also be cooling fluid channels running<br>
parallel to the hot-gas-ducting surface of the inner housing<br>
hub between an inlet orifice for the cooling fluid to enter<br>
and an outlet orifice for the cooling fluid to exit. Cooling<br>
f1uid channels of said type will enable particularly effective<br>
cooling of the inner housing hub.<br>
A hot-gas-ducting surface and in particular the inner housing<br>
hub can bo provided with a thermally insulating and/or<br>
corrosion-inhibiting and/or oxidation-inhibiting coating in<br>
PCT/EP2006/063825 / 2004P18721WOUS<br>
7<br>
order to minimize wear and tear in the hot-gas-duct.ing<br>
housing.<br>
An inventive protective shaft jacket for a gas turbine system<br>
having a compressor, a turbine and a turbine rotor is embodied<br>
for surrounding the turbine rotor in the region between the<br>
compressor and the turbine of the gas turbine system and has a<br>
depression extending in the circumferential direction entirely<br>
or partially over its circumference for accommodating a rib of<br>
a hot-gas-ducting housing element, of the hot-gas-ducting<br>
housing, requiring to be arranged around the protective shaft<br>
jacket. In the inventive protective shaft jacket the<br>
depression is located in a stud that projects radially beyond<br>
the circumferential surface and is completely closed, which is<br>
to say has no cooling fluid channels.<br>
A hot-gas-ducting housing element can be fixed in position by<br>
inserting the rib into the depression of the protective shaft<br>
jacket. The stud can therein function as, for example, a<br>
spacer between the protective shaft jacket and inner housing<br>
hub of a hot-gas-ducting housing element so that a space<br>
through which a cooling fluid can flow will remain between the<br>
inner housing hub and protective shaft jacket.<br>
An inventive housing unit includes a hot-gas-ducting housing<br>
having an inventive hot-gas-ducting housing element as well as<br>
an inventive protective shaft jacket. The hot-gas-ducting<br>
housing can therein be embodied particularly as an inner<br>
housing for a gas turbine system having at least one silo<br>
combust i on chamber.<br>
An Inventive gas turbine system includes at least one<br>
combustion chamber, a turbine part and an inventive hot-gas-<br>
PCT/EP2006/063825 / 2004P18721WOUS<br>
8<br>
ducting housing arranged between the at least one combustion<br>
chamber and the turbine part for ducting the hot gas<br>
originating from the at least one combustion chamber to the<br>
turbine part. The inventive gas turbine system can in<br>
particular include at least one silo combustion chamber and a<br>
mixer housing arranged between the silo combustion chamber and<br>
hot.-gas-ducting housing. The hot-gas-ducting housing will then<br>
be embodied as an inner housing of the gas turbine system.<br>
Further features, characteristics and advantages of the<br>
present invention will emerge from the following description<br>

inner housing.<br>
Fig. 7b shows in enlarged form a detail from Fig. 7a.<br>
An example of a gas turbine system 1 is shown in Figures la<br>
and 1b in a highly schematic form. The gas turbine system 1<br>
includes two silo combustion chambers 3, a turbine 5, a<br>
compressor 7, two mixer housings 8, and an inner housing 9.<br>
The silo combustion chambers 3 serve to burn a fuel, with the<br>
hot,, pressurized exhaust gases 2 being ducted via the mixer<br>
housings 8 and inner housing 9 to the turbine 7 in order to<br>
drive it.<br>
The turbine 5 includes stationary guide vanes 10 as well as<br>
rotor blades 11 permanently connected to a shaft 12 mounted<br>
rotatably around an axis A. The hot exhaust gas 2 expanding in<br>
the turbine 5 causes an impulse to be conveyed via the rotor<br>
blades 11 to the shaft 12, which is thereby made to rotate.<br>
The shaft 12 can be roughly divided into three sections,<br>
namely a section bearing the rotor blades 11 of the turbine 5,<br>
a section bearing rotor blades of the compressor 7 (not<br>
shown), and a shaft section 13 that is arranged between said<br>
two sections and in which no rotor blades are disposed. The<br>
shaft 12 and the rotor blades 11 attached thereto form what is<br>
termed the turbine rotor.<br>
The shaft. 12 extends through the entire gas turbine system<br>
(not shown in full) and drives the compressor 7 as well as a<br>
generator (not shown). The compressor 7 therein serves to<br>
compress air that is then ducted to the silo combustion<br>
PCT/EP2006/063825 / 2004P18721WOUS<br>
10<br>
chambers 3 for the combustion.<br>
The shaft, section 13 is surrounded by a protective shaft<br>
jacket 1b (see Fig. 2) which is itself surrounded by an inner<br>
housing hub 17 of a hot-gas-ducting housing element 6 of the<br>
inner housing 9. The inner housing 9 and protective shaft<br>
jacket 1b are Installed in the gas turbine system together as<br>
a housi nq unit.<br>
The inner housing hub 17 and protective shaft jacket 15 are<br>
shaped substantially like a hollow cylinder, with the<br>
circumferential, surface 14, facing the protective shaft: jacket<br>
1b, of the inner housing hub 17 or, as the case may be, the<br>
surface, facing the turbine rotor, of the protective shaft<br>
jacket 1b forming the inner surfaces of the hollow cylinder.<br>
The inner housing 9 therein serves on the one hand to divert<br>
the hot exhaust gas flowing from the mixer housings 8 into the<br>
inner housing 9 and, on the other, to distribute it as evenly<br>
as possible around the entire circumference of the turbine<br>
rotor. The surface 20, facing the hot gas, of the inner<br>
housing 9 therein serves as a guiding and conducting surface<br>
for the hot gas. Said surface can in particular also be<br>
provided with a thermally insulating coating or a corrosion-<br>
and/or oxidation-inhibiting coating. Potential candidates for<br>
a thermally insulating coating are, for example, what are<br>
termed thermal barrier coatings, TBC for short, which can be<br>
produced from, say, yttrium-stabilized zirconium oxide.<br>
Potential candidates for corrosion- and/or oxidation-<br>
inhibiting coatings are, for example, what are termed MCrAlY<br>
coatings, where M stands for iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), or nickel<br>
(Ni), and Y stands for yttrium (Y) and/or silicon and/or a<br>
rare-earth element, for example hafnium (Hf). Alloys of said<br>
PCT/EP2006/063825 / 2004P18721WOUS<br>

typo are known from, inter alia, the following documents, to<br>
which reference is made with respect to suitable MCrAIY<br>
coalings: EP 0 486 489 B1, EP 0 786 017 B1, EP 0 412 397 B1,<br>
and EP 1 306 454 Al. The thermal barrier coating TBC can<br>
therein have been applied in particular to the MCrAlY coating.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a section that has been taken from Fig. 1b and in<br>
which can be seen the inner housing hub 17 of the inner<br>
housing 9 and a part of the protective shaft jacket 15. Also<br>
to be seen is a section of a guide vane 10 of the turbine 5<br>
located opposite the opening 19, on the turbine side, of the<br>
i nncr housing 9.<br>
The inner housing hub 17 of the inner housing 9 has in the<br>
region of the opening 19 on the turbine side an annular rib 22<br>
that projects radially toward the protective shaft jacket 15<br>
and extends along its entire circumference.<br>
The protective shaft jacket 15 includes an annular stud 23<br>
that extends in the region of the outlet orifice 19 of the<br>
inner housing 9 along the entire circumference of the<br>
protective shaft jacket 15. The stud 23 has a groove 26<br>
serving to accommodate the rib 22 of the inner housing hub 17.<br>
The inner housing hub 17 of the hot-gas-ducting housing<br>
element 6 can be fixed in position on the protective shaft<br>
jacket 15 by means of the rib 22 and the groove 26 in the stud<br>
23.<br>
The protective shaft jacket 15 further has a radiation guard<br>
16 that surrounds it spaced therefrom. A flow channel is in<br>
that way formed between the radiation guard 16 and protective<br>
shaft jacket 15. A further flow channel is formed between the<br>
radiation guard 16 and the inner housing hub 17 of the hot-<br>
PCT/EP2006/063825 / 2004P18721WOUS<br>
12<br>
gas-ducting housing element 6. The radiation guard 16 has<br>
passage openings 21 for the passage of cooling fluid toward<br>
the inner housing hub 17 which serve to duct a cooling fluid<br>
F, for example ambient air, into the flow channel between the<br>
radiation guard 16 and inner housing hub 17 (see Fig. 3). The<br>
cooling fluid passing through the openings 21 is used for<br>
impingement cooling of the inner housing hub 17 and is<br>
forwarded to the turbine 5 via the flow channel 24 formed<br>
between the radiation guard 16 and inner housing hub 17, with<br>
the inner housing hub 17 being additionally convectively<br>
cooled. What is therein to be understood by the term<br>
"impingement cooling" is the ducting of cooling fluid flowing<br>
in a direction of said type such that it will impact against<br>
the surface 14, on the hub side, of the inner housing hub 17<br>
and be diverted by it.<br>
To make the invention easier to understand, an inner housing 9<br>
according to the prior art in which the rib of the hot-gas-<br>
ducfing housing element 6 is located in the region of the<br>
opening, on the turbine side, of the inner housing 9 will<br>
first be described with reference to Figure 3. Inner housings<br>
9 exhibiting three different embodiment variants of the<br>
inventive hot-gas-ducting housing element 6 will then be<br>
described with reference to Figures 4 to 6. The prior art and<br>
all embodiment variants have an inner housing hub 17, 17a,<br>
17b, 17c in each case provided in the region of the opening on<br>
the turbine side with a rib 22, 22a, 22b, 22c projecting<br>
beyond the circumferential surface 14, 14a, 14b, 14c on the<br>
protective shaft jacket side.<br>
One embodiment of the inner housing hub 17, radiation guard 16<br>
and protective shaft jacket 15 in the region of the rib 22 and<br>
of the stud 23 according to the prior art is shown in Fig. 3.<br>
PCT/EP2006/063825 / 2004P18721WOUS<br>
13<br>
in the prior art there are passage openings 25 shaped like<br>
drilled holes in the stud 23 below the groove 2 6 that enable<br>
the cooling fluid (indicated by arrows) to pass through the<br>
stud 23. Arranged on the protective shaft jacket 15 opposite<br>
the outlet, end of the passage hole 25 in the flow direction is<br>
a guide rib 38 that causes the flow of cooling fluid to be<br>
redirected toward the hot exhaust gas flowing through the gas<br>
turbine system.<br>
A first embodiment variant of the hot-gas-ducting housing<br>
oIement 6 is shown in Figure 4. The figure shows the inner<br>
housing hub 17a of the radiation guard 16a as well as the<br>
protective shaft jacket 15a in the region of the stud 23a. The<br>
stud 23a of the protective shaft jacket 15a shown in Fig. 4<br>
differs from the stud 23 of the protective shaft jacket 15<br>
shown in Fig. 3 in being embodied wider and not projecting so<br>
far beyond the surface 20a of the protective shaft jacket 15a.<br>
Nor does it have a passage hole for the passage of a cooling<br>
fluid. A passage opening in the form of a drilled hole 25a<br>
enabling the cooling fluid to pass through the rib 22a is<br>
instead arranged in the rib 22a of the inner housing hub 17a.<br>
The passage hole is arranged in the immediate vicinity of the<br>
ci rcumferential surface 14a, of the inner housing hub 17a,<br>
facing the protective shaft jacket 15a. Corresponding passage<br>
holes are distributed spaced apart in the circumferential<br>
direction over the entire annular rib 22a.<br>
A second embodiment variant for embodying the hot-gas-ducting<br>
housing element 6 is shown in Fig. 5. The figure shows the<br>
inner housing hub 17b, the radiation guard 16 and the<br>
protective shaft jacket 15 in the region of the stud 23. The<br>
embodiment of the protective shaft jacket 15 and radiation<br>
guard 16 is the same as that of the corresponding parts in the<br>
PCT/EP2006/063825 / 2004P18721WOUS<br>
14<br>
embodiment; described with reference to Fig. 3. However, in<br>
contrast, to the inner housing hub 17 shown in Fig. 3 the inner<br>
housing hub 17b in the second embodiment variant has passage<br>
openings in the form of passage holes 28 having openings 2 9 on<br>
the protective shaft jacket side and openings 30 on the hot<br>
gas side. Compared to the openings 29 on the protective shaft<br>
jacket side the openings 30 on the hot gas side are therein<br>
displaced in the flow direction of the hot gas. in other<br>
words, as viewed from the circumferential surface 14b on the<br>
protective shaft jacket side the openings 29 have an<br>
inclination in the flow direction of the hot exhaust gases.<br>
Through the passage holes 28, cooling fluid proceeding from<br>
the flow channel 24 enters the region of the inner housing 9<br>
ducting the hot exhaust gas and owing to the flow conditions<br>
there prevailing forms a cooling fluid film across the surface<br>
20b, of the inner housing hub 17b, on the hot gas side, in<br>
particular in the region of the rib 22b. That embodiment of<br>
the inner housing hub 17b will enable the surface 20b to be<br>
cooled very effectively.<br>
A third embodiment of the hot-gas-ducting housing element 6 is<br>
shown in Fig. 6. The figure shows the inner housing hub 17c,<br>
the radiation guard 16 and the protective shaft jacket 15 in<br>
the region of the stud 23. As in Fig. 5, the inner housing hub<br>
17c has passage openings in the form of drilled holes 28c.<br>
Said drilled holes 28c each have an opening 29c on the<br>
protective shaft jacket side and an opening 30c located in the<br>
front side of the inner housing hub 17c. Between the opening<br>
2 9c on the protective shaft jacket side and the opening 30c on<br>
the front side, each passage hole 28c runs mostly parallel to<br>
the hot-gas-ducting surface 20c of the inner housing hub 17c.<br>
PCT/EP2006/063825 / 2004P18721WOUS<br>
15<br>
Cooling fluid F entering through the opening 29c on the<br>
protective shaft jacket side is guided in the region of the<br>
rib 22c by means of the drilled holes 28c through the interior<br>
of the inner housing hub 17c and thereby causes cooling of the<br>
inner housing hub 17c before exiting from the opening.30c on<br>
the front side.<br>
In the embodiment variants described with reference to Figures<br>
5 and 6, the stud of the protective shaft jacket is in each<br>
case provided with passage openings for the passage of cooling<br>
fluid. Openings can alternatively also be provided in the rib,<br>
as has boon described with reference to Fig. 4.<br>
