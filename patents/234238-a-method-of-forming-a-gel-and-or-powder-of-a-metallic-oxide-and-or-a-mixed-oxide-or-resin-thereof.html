				<td>A METHOD OF FORMING A GEL AND/OR POWDER OF A <br>
METALLIC OXIDE AND/OR A MIXED OXIDE OR RESIN THEREOF <br><br>
[0001] The present application describes a process for making gels and/or powdered<br>
material from liquid precursors using non-thermal equilibrium plasma techniques.<br><br>
[0002] When matter is continually supplied with energy, its temperature increases and it<br>
typically transforms from a solid to a liquid and, then, to a gaseous state. Continuing to supply<br>
energy causes the system to undergo yet a further change of state in which neutral atoms or<br>
molecules of the gas are broken up by energetic collisions to produce negatively charged<br>
electrons, positive or negatively charged ions and other species. This mix of charged particles<br>
exhibiting collective behaviour is called "plasma", the fourth state of matter. Due to their<br>
electrical charge, plasmas are highly influenced by external electromagnetic fields, which make<br>
them readily controllable. Furthermore, their high energy content allows them to achieve<br>
processes which are impossible or difficult through the other states of matter, such as by liquid<br>
or gas processing.<br>
[0003] The term "plasma" covers a huge range of systems whose density and<br>
microscopic species (ions, electrons, etc.) are in approximate thermal equilibrium, the energy<br>
input into the system being widely distributed through atomic/molecular level collisions;<br>
examples include flame based plasmas. Other plasmas, however, particularly those at low<br>
pressure (e.g. 100 Pa) where collisions are relatively infrequent, have their constituent species at<br>
widely different temperatures and are called "non-thermal equilibrium" plasmas.<br>
[0004] In these non-thermal equilibrium plasmas, the free electrons are very hot with<br>
temperatures of many thousands of Kelvin (K) whilst the neutral and ionic species remain cool.<br>
Because the free electrons have almost negligible mass, the total system heat content is low and<br>
the plasma operates close to room temperature thus allowing the processing of temperature<br>
sensitive materials, such as plastics or polymers, without imposing a damaging thermal burden.<br>
The hot electrons create, through high energy collisions, a rich source of radicals and excited<br>
species with a high chemical potential energy capable of profound chemical and physical<br>
reactivity. It is this combination of low temperature operation plcs high reactivity which malats<br>
non-thermal equilibrium plasma technologically important and a very powerful tool for<br>
manufacturing and material processing as it is capable of achieving processes which, if<br>
achievable at all without plasma, would require very high temperatures or noxious and<br>
aggressive chemicals.<br>
[0005] For industrial applications of plasma technology, a convenient method is to<br>
couple electromagnetic power into a volume of process gas, which can be mixtures of gases and<br>
vapours in which the workpieces/samples to be treated are immersed or passed through. The<br>
gas becomes ionised into plasma, generating chemical radicals, UV-radiation, and ions, which<br>
react with the surface of the samples. By correct selection of process gas composition, driving<br>
power frequency, power coupling mode, pressure and other control parameters, the plasma<br>
process can be tailored to the specific application required by a manufacturer.<br>
[0006] Because of the huge chemical and thermal range of plasmas, they are suitable for<br>
many technological applications. These properties provide a strong motivation for industry to<br>
adopt plasma-based processing, and this move has been led since the 1960s by the<br>
microelectronics community which has developed low pressure Glow Discharge plasma into an<br>
ultra-high technology and high capital cost engineering tool for semiconductor, metal and<br>
dielectric processing. The same low pressure Glow Discharge type plasma has increasingly<br>
penetrated other industrial sectors since the 1980s offering, at more moderate cost, processes<br>
such as polymer surface activation for increased adhesion/bond strength, high quality<br>
degreasing/cleaning and the deposition of high performance coatings. Thus, there has been a<br>
substantial take-up of plasma technology. Glow discharges can be achieved at both vacuum<br>
and atmospheric pressures.<br>
[0007] Atmospheric pressure plasmas, however, offer industry open port or perimeter<br>
systems providing free ingress into and exit from the plasma region by workpieces/webs and,<br>
hence, on-line, continuous processing of large or small area webs or conveyor-carried discrete<br>
webs. Throughput is high, reinforced by the high species flux obtained from high pressure<br>
operation. Many industrial sectors, such as textiles, packaging, paper, medical, automotive,<br>
aerospace, etc., rely almost entirely upon continuous, on-line processing so that open<br>
port/perimeter configuration plasmas at atmospheric pressure offer a new industrial processing<br>
capability.<br>
[0008] Corona and flame (also a plasma) treatment systems have provided industry with<br>
a limited form of atmospheric pressure plasma processing capability for about 30 years.<br>
However, despite their high manufacturability, these systems have failed to penetrate the market<br>
or be taken up by industry to anything like the same extent as the lower pressure, bath-<br>
processing-only plasma type. The reason is that corona/flame systems have significant<br>
limitations. They operate in ambient air offering a single surface activation process and have a<br>
negligible effect on many materials and a weak effect on most. The treatment is often non-<br>
uniform and the corona process is incompatible with thick webs or 3D webs while the flame<br>
process is incompatible with heat sensitive powdered particles.<br>
[0009] Considerable work has been done on the stabilisation of atmospheric pressure<br>
glow discharges, such as described in Okazaki et al. J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 26 (1993) 889-<br>
892. Further, US Patent Specification No. 5414324 describes the generation of a steady-state<br>
glow discharge plasma at atmospheric pressure between a pair of electrically insulated metal<br>
plate electrodes spaced up to 5 cm apart and radio frequency (RF) energised with a root<br>
means square (rms) potential of 1 to 5 kV at 1 to 100 kHz.<br>
[0010] Metal oxides and metalloid oxides are made by a wide variety of processes.<br>
Titanium dioxide for example may be made by mixing titanium ores in sulphuric acid to<br>
make titanium sulphate, which is then calcined to produce titanium dioxide. Silicon dioxide<br>
or titanium dioxide may be prepared by reacting their respective chloride with oxygen at an<br>
elevated temperature. In this method, the reactants are brought to reaction temperatures<br>
by combusting a flammable gas such as methane or propane.<br>
[0011] One of the main problems with the "wet chemistry" type preparations of<br>
oxides is that the average particle size of the resulting powder particles tend to be<br>
significantly larger than optimally required in many of today's applications for such products.<br>
[0012] The use of thermal-equilibrium plasma processes for the production of the<br>
oxides of silicon, titanium, aluminium, zirconium, iron and antimony has been described in<br>
US 20020192138, which was published after the priority date of the present application, in<br>
which a plasma generator producing a temperature of between 3000 and 12000° C is used to<br>
oxidize vapours of salts of the above metals and metalloids.<br>
[0013] Many electronics and/or optical based applications exist for metal and<br>
metalloid oxides, for example, they may be utilized to enhance the refractive indices of<br>
silicone polymers, organic resins and glasses such as by blending TiO2 or ZiO2 with silica or<br>
organopolysiloxane or to react silica or silicone/silicate precursors with titanium alkoxides as<br>
described in WO 99/19266 or with a TiO2-ZrO2-SiO2-SnO2 composite sol as described in JP<br>
11-310755. However, the refractive index of the final inorganic material is usually lower<br>
than theoretically expected either because of the difficulty of preparing nano-sized particles,<br>
the inhomogeneity resulting from a broad particles size distribution, the tendency for<br>
nanoparticles to self-aggregate resulting to a light scattering effect phenomenon.<br>
[0014] Organosilicone resins are generally synthesized by the hydrolysis and<br>
subsequent condensation of chlorosilanes, alkoxysilanes and silicates, such as sodium silicate.<br>
They are generally described using the M, D, T and Q nomenclature in which M units have<br>
the general formula RsSiO1/2, d units have the general formula R2SiO2/2, T units have the<br>
general formula RSiO3/2 and Q units have the general formula SiO4/2 where, unless otherwise<br>
indicated, each R group is an organic hydrocarbon group, typically a methyl group.<br>
[0015] In accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention there is<br>
provided a method of forming a gel and/or powder of a metallic oxide, metalloid oxide and/or<br>
a mixed oxide or resin thereof from one or more respective organometallic liquid precursor(s)<br>
and/or organometalloid liquid precursor(s) by oxidatively treating said liquid in a non-thermal<br>
equilibrium plasma discharge and/or an ionised gas stream resulting therefrom and collecting<br>
the resulting product.<br>
[0016] For the purposes of this application a powder is a solid material in the form of<br>
spherical particles, pellets, platelets, needles/tubes, flakes, dust, granulates and any aggregates<br>
of the aforementioned forms. For the purposes of this application a gel is a typically<br>
transparent jelly-like material in the form of a thin film or solidified mass.<br>
[0017] Non-thermal equilibrium plasma techniques typically operate at temperatures<br>
below 200°C but preferably the method of the present invention will operate at temperatures<br>
between room temperature (20 ° C) and 70° C and is typically utilized at a temperature in the<br>
region of 30 to 50 ° C, but will depend on the product to be obtained.<br>
[0018] The metals, whose oxides and the like this invention particularly relates, are<br>
those of columns 3a and 4a of the periodic table, namely aluminium, gallium, indium,<br>
tellurium, tin, lead and the transition metals. Hence, metallic oxide products of the present<br>
invention may be either single metal oxides such as, for example, the oxides of titanium,<br>
zirconium, iron, aluminium indium, lead and tin, mixed oxides include, for example,<br>
aluminium silicate, aluminium titanate, lead bisilicate, lead titanate, zinc stannate,TiO2-ZrO2-<br>
SiO2-SnO2 and a mixed indium-tin oxide. Proportions of mixed oxides may be determined<br>
by the ratios of the amounts of each constituent of the precursor to be plasma treated in the<br>
method of the present invention.<br>
[0019] A metalloid or semi-metal (hereafter referred to as a metalloid) is an element<br>
having both metallic and non-metallic properties and is selected from boron, silicon,<br>
germanium, arsenic, antimony and tellurium. Preferred metalloid oxide products made<br>
according to the process of the present invention are in particular oxides of silicon including<br>
silicone resins and the like, boron, antimony and germanium. In particular a silicone resin<br>
having the following empirical formula:-<br>
(R"'3Si01/2)w(R"'2SiO2/2)x(R"'SiO3/2)p(Si04/2)2<br>
where each R'" is independently an alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, H, OH, and wherein<br>
w + x + p + z=l and w 0.1 may be formed by the process in accordance<br>
with the present invention.<br>
[0020] Thus in the method of the present invention it is particularly preferred to use<br>
organometallic liquid precursors of the above listed metals and/or organometalloid liquid<br>
precursors of the above listed metalloids. One of the main advantages of the present<br>
invention is that no solvent is usually required and preferably no solvent is used at all, i.e. the<br>
organometallic and/or organometalloid liquid precursors used in the method of the present<br>
invention are solvent-free.<br>
[0021] Preferably in the case of organometallic based precursors, the precursor may<br>
contain any suitable oxidisable groups including chlorides, hydrides, diketonates,<br>
carboxylates and mixed oxidisable groups for example, di-t-butoxydiacetoxysilane or<br>
titanium dichloro diethoxide, titanium diisopropoxide bis(ethyl-acetoacetate) or titanium<br>
diisopropoxide bis(tetramethylheptanedionate), but liquid metal alkoxides are particularly<br>
preferred. Liquid metal alkoxides suitable for use as precursors in the present invention may,<br>
for example, have the following general formula:-<br>
M(OR')y<br>
where M is a metal, y is the number of alkoxide groups linked to the metal and each R' is the<br>
same or different and is a linear or branched alkyl group having between 1 and 10 carbon<br>
atoms such as, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, t-butyl, pentyl and hexyl.<br>
Examples of suitable metal alkoxides include, for example, titanium isopropoxide, tin t-<br>
butoxide and aluminium ethoxide. Mixed metallic alkoxides may also be used as liquid<br>
precursors, for example indium-tin alkoxides, aluminium titanium alkoxides, aluminium<br>
yttrium alkoxides, and aluminium zirconium alkoxides. Metallic-metalloid mixed alkoxides<br>
may also be utilized such as for example di-s-butoxyaluminoxytriethoxysilane.<br>
[0022] Similarly organometalloid liquid precursors may contain any suitable groups,<br>
which will oxidize in an oxidising non-thermal equilibrium plasma to form the respective<br>
oxide, and in particular, in the case of silicon, to form silicon resins. Examples of suitable<br>
metalloid alkoxides include silicon tetramethoxide and germanium tetraisopropoxide. It is to<br>
be understood that the term organometalloid liquid as used herein includes polymers of<br>
organometalloid elements and in particular in the case of silicon may include liquid<br>
organosilanes such as, for example diphenylsilane and dialkylsilanes, e.g. diethylsilane and/or<br>
linear, branched and/or cyclic organopolysiloxanes for the formation of silica and silicates<br>
(silicone resins).<br>
[0023] The level of transformation of the liquid precursor from the liquid phase to a<br>
gel and/or to powder depends on the plasma treatment time in a batch process or residence<br>
time in a continuous process.<br>
[0024] The linear or branched organopolysiloxanes suitable as liquid precursors for<br>
the method of the present invention include liquids of the general formula W-A-W where A is<br>
a polydiorganosiloxane chain having siloxane units of the formula R"sSiO 4-s/2 in which each<br>
R" independently represents an alkyl group having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, an alkenyl<br>
group such as vinyl, propenyl and/or hexenyl groups; hydrogen; an aryl group such as phenyl,<br>
a halide group, an alkoxy group, an epoxy group, an acryloxy group, an alkylacryloxy group<br>
or a fluorinated alkyl group and generally s has a value of 2 but may in some instances be 0 or<br>
1. Preferred materials are linear materials i.e. s = 2 for all units. Preferred materials have<br>
polydiorganosiloxane chains according to the general formula -(R"2SiO)m- in which each R"<br>
is independently as hereinbefore described and m has a value from about 1 to about 4000.<br>
Suitable materials have viscosities of the order of about 0.65 mPa.s to about 1,000,000 mPa.s.<br>
When high viscosity materials are used, they can be diluted in suitable solvents to allow<br>
delivery of liquid precursor in the form of a finely dispersed atomised spray, or fine droplets,<br>
although as previously discussed, it is preferred to avoid the need for solvents if at all<br>
possible. Most preferably, the viscosity of the liquid precursor is in the range between about<br>
0.65 mPa.s and 1000 mPa.s and may include mixtures of linear or branched<br>
organopolysiloxanes as hereinbefore described suitable as liquid precursors.<br>
[0025] The groups W may be the same or different. The W groups may be selected,<br>
for example, from -Si(R")2X, or<br>
-Si(R")2-(B)d -R''SiR"k(X)3-k<br>
where B is -R''-(Si(R')2-O)r-Si(R')2- and<br>
R" is as aforesaid, R"' is a divalent hydrocarbon group r is zero a whole number between 1<br>
and 6 and d is 0 or a whole number, most preferably d is 0,1 or 2, X may be the same as R"<br>
or a hydrolysable group such as an alkoxy group containing alkyl groups having up to 6<br>
carbon atoms, an epoxy group or a methacryloxy group or a halide.<br>
[0026] Cyclic organopolysiloxanes having the general formula (R'2SiO 2/2)n wherein<br>
R" is hereinbefore described, n is from 3 to 100 but is preferably from 3 to 22, most<br>
preferably n is from 3 to 6. Liquid precursors may comprise mixtures of cyclic<br>
organopolysiloxanes as hereinbefore defined.<br>
[0027] The liquid precursor may also comprise mixtures comprising one or more of<br>
the linear or branched organopolysiloxanes as hereinbefore described with one or more of the<br>
cyclic organopolysiloxanes as hereinbefore described.<br>
[0028] The average particle size of the particles formed is preferably from 1 nm<br>
(nanometer) to 2000 mm (or micron), preferably between 10 nm and 250 mm.<br>
[0029] The liquid precursor may be brought into contact with the plasma discharge<br>
and/or an ionised gas stream resulting therefrom by any suitable means. In a preferred<br>
embodiment the liquid precursor is preferably introduced into the plasma apparatus by way of a<br>
liquid spray through an atomiser or nebuliser (hereinafter referred to as an atomiser) as<br>
described in the applicants co-pending application WO 02/28548, which was published after the<br>
priority date of this application. This provides the invention with a major advantage over the<br>
prior art in that the liquid precursor may be introduced into the plasma discharge or resulting<br>
stream in the absence of a carrier gas, i.e. they can be introduced directly by, for example,<br>
direct injection, whereby the liquid precursors are injected directly into the plasma. Hence,<br>
the inventors avoid the need for the essential features of US 20020192138 which as discussed<br>
above requires both very high working temperatures and the need for the salts to be in a<br>
vaporous form.<br>
[0030] m the case when the liquid precursor is introduced into the plasma apparatus by<br>
way of a liquid spray through an atomiser or nebuliser, said liquid precursor may be atomised<br>
using any conventional means, for example an ultrasonic nozzle. The atomiser preferably<br>
produces a liquid precursor drop size of from 10 nm to l00mm, more preferably from lmm to<br>
50mm. Suitable atomisers for use in the method in accordance with the present invention are<br>
ultrasonic nozzles from Sono-Tek Corporation, Milton, New York, USA or Lechler GmbH of<br>
Metzingen Germany.<br>
[0031] The liquid precursor may alternatively be entrained on a carrier gas or<br>
transported in a vortex or dual cyclone type apparatus, in which case the liquid to be treated<br>
may be fed in from one or more inlets within the plasma apparatus. The liquid may also be<br>
suspended in a fluid bed arrangement within the plasma apparatus. Furthermore, the liquid<br>
precursor may be maintained stationary in a suitable receptacle, in which case, if required, the<br>
plasma unit generating the plasma discharge and/or an ionised gas stream may be moved<br>
relative to the receptacle. Whichever means of transporting and/or retaining the liquid<br>
precursor is utilized, it is preferred that the exposure time in which liquid precursor remains<br>
within the plasma discharge and/or an ionised gas stream is constant in order to ensure an<br>
even treatment throughout the duration of the method in accordance with the present<br>
invention.<br>
[0032] Any suitable non-thermal equilibrium plasma equipment may be used to<br>
undertake the method of the present invention, however atmospheric pressure glow discharge,<br>
dielectric barrier discharge (DBD), low pressure glow discharge, which may be operated in<br>
either continuous mode or pulse mode.<br>
[0033] Any conventional means for generating an atmospheric pressure glow<br>
discharge may be used in the method of the present invention, for example atmospheric<br>
pressure plasma jet, atmospheric pressure microwave glow discharge and atmospheric<br>
pressure glow discharge. Typically, such means will employ helium as a process gas and a<br>
high frequency (e.g.&gt; 1kHz) power supply to generate a homogeneous glow discharge at<br>
atmospheric pressure via a Penning ionisation mechanism, (see for example, Kanazawa et al,<br>
J.Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 1988,21, 838, Okazaki et al, Proc. Jpn. Symp. Plasma Chem. 1989,2,<br>
95, Kanazawa et al, Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physical Research 1989, B37/38,<br>
842, and Yokoyama et al., J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 1990,23, 374).<br>
[0034] A typical atmospheric pressure glow discharge generating apparatus for use in<br>
the method of the present invention may one or more pairs of parallel or concentric electrodes<br>
between which a plasma is generated in a substantially constant gap of from 3 to 50mm, for<br>
example 5 to 25mm between the electrodes or more preferably between dielectric coatings on<br>
the electrodes. The actual distance between adjacent parallel electrodes used, whilst up to a<br>
maximum of 50 mm is dependent on the process gas used. The electrodes being radio<br>
frequency (RF) energised with a root mean square (rms) potential of 1 to 100 kV, preferably<br>
between 1 and 30 kV and most preferably between 2.5 and 10 kV, however the actual value<br>
will depend on the chemistry/gas choice and plasma region size between the electrodes. The<br>
frequency is generally between from 1 to 100 kHz, preferably at 15 to 50 kHz.<br>
[0035] The process gas for use in an atmospheric plasma treatment method in<br>
accordance with the present invention may be any suitable gas but is preferably a noble gas or<br>
noble gas based mixture such as, for example helium, a mixture of helium and argon and an<br>
argon based mixture additionally containing ketones and/or related compounds. In the<br>
present invention these process gases are utilized in combination with one or more potentially<br>
reactive gases suitable for affecting the required oxidation of the liquid precursor such as, for<br>
example, 02, H2O, nitrogen oxides such as NO2, or air and the like. Most preferably, the<br>
process gas will be Helium in combination with an oxidizing gas, typically oxygen or air.<br>
However, the selection of gas depends upon the plasma processes to be undertaken. The<br>
oxidizing gas will preferably be utilized in a mixture comprising 90 - 99% noble gas and 1 to<br>
10% oxidizing gas.<br>
[0036] In the case of low pressure glow discharge plasma, liquid precursor is<br>
preferably either retained in a container or is introduced into the reactor in the form of an<br>
atomised liquid spray as described above. The low pressure plasma may be performed with<br>
liquid precursor heating and/or pulsing of the plasma discharge, but is preferably carried out<br>
without the need for additional heating. If heating is required, the method in accordance with<br>
the present invention using low pressure plasma techniques may be cyclic, i.e. the liquid<br>
precursor is plasma treated with no heating, followed by heating with no plasma treatment,<br>
etc., or may be simultaneous, i.e. liquid precursor heating and plasma treatment occurring<br>
together. The plasma may be generated by way of the electromagnetic radiations from any<br>
suitable source, such as radio frequency, microwave or direct current (DC). A radio<br>
frequency (RF) range between 8 and 16 MHz is suitable with an RF of 13.56 MHz preferred.<br>
In the case of low pressure glow discharge any suitable reaction chamber may be utilized.<br>
The power of the electrode system may be between 1 and 100 W, but preferably is in the<br>
region of from 5 to 50 W for continuous low pressure plasma techniques. The chamber<br>
pressure may be reduced to any suitable pressure for example from 0.1 to 0.0lmbar but<br>
preferably is between 0.05 and 0.01 mbar.<br>
[0037] A particularly preferred plasma treatment process involves pulsing the plasma<br>
discharge at room temperature. The plasma discharge is pulsed to have a particular "on" time<br>
and "off" time, such that a very low average power is applied, for example a power of less<br>
than 10W and preferably less than 1W. The on-time is typically from 10 to l0000ms,<br>
preferably 10 to 1000ms, and the off-time typically from 1000 to l0000ms, preferably from<br>
1000 to 5000ms. Atomised liquid precursors may be introduced into the vacuum with no<br>
additional gases, i.e. by direct injection, however additional process gases such as helium or<br>
argon may also be utilized as carriers where deemed necessary.<br>
[0038] In the case of the low pressure plasma options the process gas for forming the<br>
plasma may be as described for the atmospheric pressure system but may alternatively not<br>
comprise noble gases such as helium and/or argon and may therefore purely be oxygen, air or<br>
an alternative oxidising gas.<br>
[0039] The gel and/or powder products of the present invention may subsequently be<br>
treated as required, using plasma techniques or otherwise, by any suitable process. In particular<br>
products made by the present invention may be cleaned and/or activated or coated, for example,<br>
by application of a liquid or solid spray through an atomiser or nebuliser as described in the<br>
applicants co-pending application WO 02/28548, which was published after the priority date of<br>
this application.<br>
[0040] The present invention further provides apparatus for making a gel and/or<br>
powder in accordance with the previous aspect of the present invention, which apparatus<br>
comprises a non-equilibrium plasma apparatus comprising a means for introducing and/or<br>
retaining a liquid precursor and a means for collecting and/or retaining the resulting gel<br>
and/or powder product.<br>
[0041] The means for retaining the liquid precursor and the means for retaining the<br>
gel and/or powder product may be the same.<br>
[0042] In the case of an atmospheric plasma apparatus, the plasma apparatus may be<br>
orientated vertically, allowing the liquid precursor to be gravity fed. For example, if<br>
atmospheric pressure glow discharge is employed, using either flat, parallel electrodes, or<br>
concentric parallel electrodes, the electrodes may be orientated vertically. In this case, liquid<br>
precursor to be treated may be transported through the plasma region in an upwardly or<br>
downwardly direction. The liquid precursor is preferably introduced at the top of the plasma<br>
apparatus and passes through the plasma region, where oxidation and the formation of the<br>
oxide based powder products in accordance with the method of the present invention are<br>
formed. The resulting powdered product may then exit the chamber at the base. The liquid<br>
precursor residence time in the plasma region may be predetermined to be as required for the<br>
successful formation of a powder, alternatively the path length of the liquid precursor through<br>
the plasma region may be altered as required.<br>
[0043] In the case of atmospheric pressure plasma assemblies each electrode may<br>
comprise any suitable geometry and construction. Metal electrodes may be used and may be<br>
in, for example, the form of metallic plates or mesh. The metal electrodes may be bonded to the<br>
dielectric material either by adhesive or by some application of heat and fusion of the metal of<br>
the electrode to the dielectric material. Alternatively one or more of the electrodes may be<br>
encapsulated within the dielectric material or may be in the form of a dielectric material with a<br>
metallic coating such as, for example a dielectric, preferably a glass dielectric with a sputtered<br>
metallic coating.<br>
[0044] In one embodiment of the invention each electrode is of the type described in<br>
the applicants co-pending application WO 02/35576 which was published after the priority<br>
date of the present invention wherein there are provided electrode units containing an<br>
electrode and an adjacent a dielectric plate and a cooling liquid distribution system for<br>
directing a cooling conductive liquid onto the exterior of the electrode to cover a planar face<br>
of the electrode. Each electrode unit may comprise a watertight box having a side formed by<br>
a dielectric plate having bonded thereto on the interior of the box the planar electrode together<br>
with a liquid inlet and a liquid outlet. The liquid distribution system may comprise a cooler<br>
and a recirculation pump and/or a sparge pipe incorporating spray nozzles.<br>
[0045] Ideally, the cooling liquid covers the face of the electrode remote from the<br>
dielectric plate. The cooling conductive liquid is preferably water and may contain conductivity<br>
controlling compounds such as metal salts or soluble organic additives. Ideally, the electrode is<br>
a metal electrode in contact with the dielectric plate. In one embodiment, there is a pair of metal<br>
electrodes each in contact with a dielectric plate. The water as well as being an extremely<br>
efficient cooling agent to also assists in providing an efficient electrode.<br>
[0046] The dielectric materials may be made from any suitable dielectric, examples<br>
include but are not restricted to polycarbonate, polyethylene, glass, glass laminates, epoxy<br>
filled glass laminates and the like.<br>
[0047] In one embodiment of the invention a statically electric charged porous plate<br>
or a vibrating sieve may be placed in line with the exit of the powdered particles from the<br>
plasma region to collect the resulting powdered particles.<br>
[0048] One particular advantage of the present invention is that the inventors have<br>
been able to prepare silicone resins as described above by way of a single step method from<br>
polymeric liquid precursors rather than from the usual monomeric precursors. The silicone<br>
resins contain high levels of T and or Q siloxy units and may be in the form of gels and/or<br>
powder. Depending on the molecular structures of the liquid precursors, incorporation of M<br>
and/or D siloxy units may be undertaken. Typically such resins are prepared by the<br>
hydrolysis and subsequent condensation of monomeric and/or polymeric precursors such as<br>
chlorosilanes, alkoxysilanes or sodium silicates.<br>
[0049] A further perceived advantage is that the particle size of the powder made in<br>
accordance with the method of the present invention are generally in the nanometre size range<br>
(nanoparticles). Hence, powdered particles produced by the method of the present invention<br>
may have various utilities, for example they may be useful in the fields of optoelectronics,<br>
photonics, solid-state electronics, flexible electronics, optical devices flat panel displays and<br>
solar cells. Silicone resins made by the method of the present invention may be used as high<br>
performance composites, fire resistant materials, electrically and/or thermally insulation<br>
coatings for example for the microelectronic industry, optically clear coatings and high<br>
refractive index coatings for example for the display industry in applications such as<br>
televisions, flat panel displays, for the ophthalmic industry in applications such as ophthalmic<br>
lenses. Indium-tin mixed oxides are used as electrodes for transparent electrically conductive<br>
films and flat panel displays.<br>
[0050] The present invention will now be described further based on the following<br>
examples and drawings in which :-<br>
Fig. 1 shows a plan view of an embodiment of the invention where the powdered particles are<br>
transported through the plasma region by gravity.<br>
Fig.2 is a 29Si solid-state NMR spectrum by the cross-polarisation-magic angle spinning (CP-<br>
MAS) method of the silicone resin product prepared in Example 1.<br>
Fig. 3a is a 29Si liquid-state NMR spectrum by the CP-MAS method of the liquid precursor<br>
used in Example 5; and<br>
Fig. 3b is a 29Si solid-state NMR spectrum by the CP-MAS method of the powdered product<br>
in Example 5.<br>
[0051] In a first embodiment as shown in Fig. 1 there is provided an atmospheric<br>
pressure glow discharge apparatus for making powdered particles which relies upon gravity<br>
for transport of the liquid precursors and synthesised powdered particles through the<br>
atmospheric pressure glow discharge apparatus. The apparatus comprises a casing made of a<br>
dielectric material such as polypropylene, a pair of parallel electrodes 2 and an atomiser<br>
nozzle 3 for the introduction of the liquid precursor. In use, a process gas, typically helium in<br>
combination with an oxidising gas, for example oxygen, is introduced into the top of the<br>
column 5 from delivery means 4 and an appropriate potential difference is applied between<br>
the electrodes to affect a plasma therebetween as identified by the plasma region 6.<br>
Appropriate amounts of the liquid precursor from are introduced by way of nozzle 3 into<br>
plasma region 6. The liquid precursor and subsequently formed powder product fall under<br>
gravity through plasma zone 6 and are collected upon exiting the apparatus in collecting<br>
means 7.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
[0052] This example utilises the atmospheric pressure glow discharge equipment<br>
described above in relation to Fig. 1. The atmospheric pressure glow discharge was generated<br>
by applying RF power of 1 W/cm2 to two electrodes adhered to glass plates that enclose a<br>
helium/oxygen gas mixture in the ratio of 98/2. Tetramethylcyclotetrasiloxane (TMCTS) was<br>
supplied to an ultrasonic nozzle at a flow rate of 200 microlitres per minute. TMCTS<br>
droplets were discharged from the ultrasonic nozzle above the atmospheric pressure glow<br>
discharge. These TMCTS droplets pass through the atmospheric pressure glow discharge and<br>
form a fine white powder which was collected below the atmospheric pressure glow<br>
discharge. The white powder prepared during the method as described in example 1 was<br>
analysed by 29Si solid-state NMR using a Cross Polarisation Magic Angle Spinning process<br>
with a speed of 5 KHz, Cross polarisation time of 5 rns and Pulse delay of 5 sees.<br>
[0053] Fig 2 shows the 29Si NMR CP-MAS spectrum of the white powder formed in<br>
APGD and indicates that the TMCTS has been oxidised and condensed into a polymeric<br>
form. The spectra was assigned as follows:-<br>
Chemical Shift Assignment<br>
-15 to -30 In the region associated with Me2SiO2/2 (D units)<br>
-30 to -40 MeHSiO2/2 (DH units)<br>
-50 to -60 MeSiO2/2OR (DOR where R = H or an aliphatic group)<br>
-60 to -70 MeSiO3/2 (T units)<br>
-80 to -90 HSiO3/2 (TH units)<br>
-95 to -115 SiO3/2OH and silica SiO4/2 (Q3 and Q4 groups respectively)<br>
[0054] Examples 2 to 7 all describe examples using a continuous low pressure glow<br>
discharge plasma system. The plasma apparatus used in this study was a radio frequency (10<br>
- 12 MHz) model PDC-002 (Harrick Scientific Corp., Ossining, NY, USA.) The chamber<br>
volume was 3000 cm3. Examples 2 to 7 were all carried out using the same procedure.<br>
Initially, the plasma apparatus was pumped down to a base pressure of 0.008 mbar. The<br>
process gas was introduced into the chamber to a pressure of 0.2 mbar for two minutes, and<br>
the plasma activated for 10 minutes at this pressure at high power to thoroughly clean the<br>
chamber. The plasma was then deactivated, and the chamber flushed with process gas for a<br>
further two minutes. The chamber was then vented, the sample was inserted retained in a<br>
petri dish and the chamber was pumped down to 0.008 mbar. Process gas was then<br>
introduced at a pressure of 0.2 mbar, and the plasma activated for the required time using the<br>
low power setting of 7.2 W. The chamber was then vented to air prior to surface analysis of<br>
the samples.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
[0055] A trimethylsilyl-terminated-polydimethylsiloxane (TMS-t-PDMS) hereafter<br>
called PDMS fluid, having a viscosity of 100 mPa.s and an average degree of polymerisation<br>
of 80, was introduced in a low pressure glow discharge nitrogen/oxygen (79/21 synthetic air)<br>
plasma reactor. The PDMS fluid (2 ml) was placed in a petri dish to increase the surface<br>
/volume ratio and was treated as described above. After an initial plasma treatment the<br>
surface of the PDMS fluid was transformed into a polysiloxane resinous material in a gel<br>
form. Increasing the plasma treatment time led to the transformation of the fluid to a resin in<br>
a powder form.<br>
[0056] The final duration of the plasma treatment was 20 minutes. Part of the fluid<br>
was transformed into a resinous material. The resinous material was separated from the<br>
liquid material. The liquid material was analysed by liquid-state 29silicon NMR. The<br>
formation of both silanol groups at the end of and within the PDMS fluid polymeric chains<br>
and new Si-O-Si linkages in strained polycyclic structures was demonstrated.<br>
[0057] Analysis of the resinous material showed exactly the same groups formed e.g.<br>
silanol and polycyclic structures as compared to the liquid fraction but at higher<br>
concentration. The 29Si chemical shifts were -10.5 ppm for terminal silanol (MOH), -53.1<br>
ppm for silanol (DOH), -55.0 to - 61.0 for siloxane cyclics (T). In addition a signal attributed<br>
to Si-CH2-Si linkage was identified at —29.1 ppm. These analytical data, suggest the<br>
following mechanisms of formation of the resinous powder material. Si-OH groups are first<br>
formed and then chemically condense to form Si-O-Si linkages that are the basis of the<br>
resinous chemical structure. Additionally Si-CH2-Si crosslinks are also formed. Hence the<br>
NMR results indicate that plasma treatment in accordance with the present invention has<br>
modified the chemical structure of the PDMS fluid starting material resulting in the formation<br>
of an organosilicone resin comprising mainly D and T siloxy groups.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
[0058] A PDMS fluid having a viscosity of 50 mPa.s and an average degree of<br>
polymerisation of 50 was introduced in to a low-pressure glow discharge oxygen (99.9995 %)<br>
plasma reactor. The PDMS fluid (2 ml) was placed in a petri dish to increase the surface<br>
/volume ratio. The surface of the PDMS fluid was transformed into an organosilicone resin<br>
upon plasma treatment for a period of 10 minutes. The quantity of organosilicone resin was<br>
increased by intermittently switching off the plasma and by mixing the product under plasma<br>
treatment.<br>
[0059] The resinous material was analysed by FT-InfraRed spectroscopy and was<br>
identified to have silicone resin structure. 29Si solid-state NMR confirmed the organosilicone<br>
resin structure as composed of largely D, DOH and T siloxy units.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
[0060] A PDMS fluid having a viscosity of 20 mPa.s and an average degree of<br>
polymerisation of 27 was introduced in a low pressure glow discharge nitrogen/oxygen (79/21<br>
synthetic air) plasma reactor. The PDMS fluid (2 ml) was placed in a petri dish to increase<br>
the surface /volume ratio. The surface of the PDMS fluid was transformed into a<br>
organosilicone resin upon plasma treatment during 20 minutes. The quantity of<br>
organosilicone resin was increased by intermittently switching off the plasma and by mixing<br>
the product under plasma treatment.<br>
[0061] The resulting organosilicone resin was separated from the liquid. The liquid<br>
material was analysed by 29Si liquid-state NMR. The formation of both silanol groups at the<br>
end of and within the PDMS fluid polymeric chains and new Si-O-Si linkages in strained<br>
polycyclic structures was identified. Analysis of the organosilicone resin showed exactly the<br>
same groups formed e.g. silanol and polycyclic structures but at higher concentration. The<br>
29Si solid-state NMR chemical shifts were -10.7 ppm for terminal silanol (MOH), -53.1 ppm<br>
for silanol (DOH) and -55.0 to - 61.0 for siloxane cyclics (T). Again the 29Si solid-state NMR<br>
results indicated that the process in accordance with the present invention has modified the<br>
chemical structure of the PDMS fluid. The organosilicone resin had a structure which mainly<br>
consisted of D and T groups.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
[0062] A trimemylsilyl-terrninated-polydimethyl-co-hydrogenmethylsiloxane (TMS-t-<br>
PDM-HMS) hereafter called silicone fluid having a viscosity of 100 mPa.s, an average degree<br>
of polymerisation of 90 and containing 5 % of hydrogen methyl siloxy units, was introduced<br>
in a low pressure glow discharge oxygen (99.9995 %) plasma reactor. A 29Si solid- state<br>
NMR spectra of the silicone fluid liquid precursor is provided as Fig. 3a in which can be seen<br>
signals show the M terminal groups at +7 ppm, D groups at -22 ppm and DH groups at -38<br>
ppm. It is to be noted that no signals are seen in the -50 to —120 ppm range.<br>
[0063] The silicone fluid (2 ml) was placed in a petri dish to increase the surface<br>
/volume ratio. The surface of the silicone fluid was transformed into an organosilicone resin<br>
upon plasma treatment and a white powder was collected on the wall of the chamber. During<br>
the formation of the resin and the powder the intensity of plasma glow increased without<br>
changing colour. Increasing plasma treatment time increased white powder content.<br>
[0064] The white powder and the resinous material were separated from the liquid<br>
material. The liquid material was analysed by 29Si liquid-state NMR. Again the formation of<br>
silanol groups at the end of and within the silicone fluid polymeric chains and of new Si-O-Si<br>
linkages in strained polycyclic structures was demonstrated. 29Si solid-state NMR analysis of<br>
the resinous material as seen in Fig. 3b showed exactly the same groups formed e.g. silanol<br>
and polycyclic structures as compared to the liquid fraction but at higher concentration. It can<br>
be seen in Fig. 3b that the terminal M and DH groups seen in Fig. 3 a have been chemically<br>
transformed into new groups appearing in the region of-50 to -120 ppm range.<br>
[0065] The 29Si solid-state NMR chemical shifts were -10.7 ppm for terminal silanol<br>
(MOH), -53.1 ppm for silanol (DOH), -55.0 to - 61.0 for siloxane cyclics (T). In addition a<br>
signal attributed to Si-CH2-Si linkage was identified at —29.1 ppm. The white powder was<br>
analysed by solid-state 29Si NMR at magic angle spinning and gate decoupling mode to obtain<br>
a semi-quantitative analysis of the chemical structure. The white powder was found to be an<br>
organosilicone resin having the following structure:-<br>
D0.24-DOh 0.08- T3 0.16 — Q2 0.03 -Q3 0.20-Q4 0-29<br>
Where D is (CH3)2SiO2/2, DOH is (CH3)Si02/2(OH), T3 is (CH3)SiO3/2<br>
Q2 is SiO2/2(OH)2, Q3 is SiO3/2(OH) and Q4 is SiO4/2.<br>
[0066] Particles Size analysis of the white organosilicone resin powder was<br>
undertaken using a Coulter LS 230 Laser Particles Size Analyser (from 0.04 to 2000 mm), in<br>
water, using the Mie theory and the glass optical model calculation for a fluid corresponding<br>
to water (RI 1.332) and sample corresponding to glass (real 1.5 RI, imaginary 0). The particle<br>
size distribution of these organosilicone resin is polydispersed and centred (50% in volume)<br>
at a particle diameter of below 400 ran.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
Silicone resin from SiH copolymer 100 mPa.s in oxygen plasma and in controlled atmosphere<br>
exposure.<br>
[0067] In example 5, the resinous and powdery products formed after plasma<br>
treatment of the trimethylsilyl-terminated-polydimethyl-co-hydrogenmethylsiloxane (TMS-t-<br>
PDM-HMS) polymer was exposed to open laboratory atmosphere before chemical structural<br>
analysis. In this example, the experiments were conducted in a glove box under a controlled<br>
atmosphere of pure nitrogen. The oxygen level was kept under 50 ppm and moisture was<br>
controlled by the purity of the nitrogen gas. The surface of silicone fluid was transformed in<br>
to a polysiloxane resinous material upon plasma treatment and a white powder was collected<br>
on the wall of the chamber. During the formation of the resin and the powder the intensity of<br>
plasma glow increased without changing colour. Increasing plasma treatment time increased<br>
white powder content. Immediately after plasma treatment, the resinous product was<br>
transferred into an NMR tube under a controlled atmosphere in which no contact with<br>
atmospheric oxygen or moisture was possible.<br>
[0068] The white powder and the resinous material were separated from the liquid<br>
material. The liquid material was analysed by 29Si liquid-state NMR. The formation of both<br>
silanol groups at the end of and within the PDMS polymeric chains and of new Si-O-Si<br>
linkages in strained polycyclic structures were both again demonstrated. Analysis of the<br>
resinous material by 29Si solid-state NMR showed that exactly the same groups were present,<br>
e.g. silanol and polycyclic structures, as compared to the liquid fraction but at higher<br>
concentration levels. The 29Si solid-state NMR were -10.7 ppm for terminal silanol (MOH), -<br>
53.1 ppm for silanol (DOH), -55.0 to - 61.0 for siloxane cyclics (T). In addition a signal<br>
attributed to Si-CH2-Si group was identified at -29.1 ppm. The white powder was analysed<br>
by 29Si solid-state NMR at magic angle spinning and gate decoupling mode to obtain a semi-<br>
quantitative analysis of the chemical structure.<br>
[0069] The general structure of the resinous material was identical to the material that<br>
was formed and exposed to open laboratory, detailed in example 5. NMR results indicated<br>
that plasma irradiation had modified the chemical structure of the silicone fluid.<br>
[0070] Particles Size analysis of the white organosilicone resin powder was<br>
undertaken using a Coulter LS 230 Laser Particles Size Analyser (from 0.04 to 2000 mm), in<br>
water, using the Mie theory and the standard Fraunhofer optical model calculation. The<br>
particle size distribution of these organosilicone resin is polydispersed and centred (50% in<br>
volume) at a particle diameter of below 120 mm.<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
[0071] In example 4, the resinous product formed after plasma treatment of the<br>
PDMS fluid was exposed to the open atmosphere in the laboratory before chemical structural<br>
analysis. In this example, the experiments were conducted in a glove box under a controlled<br>
atmosphere of pure nitrogen. The oxygen level was maintained below 50 ppm and moisture<br>
was controlled by the purity of the nitrogen gas. The surface of the silicone fluid was<br>
transformed in to a polysiloxane resinous material upon plasma treatment and a white powder<br>
was collected on the wall of the chamber. Increasing plasma treatment time increased white<br>
powder content. Immediately after plasma treatment, the resinous product was transferred<br>
into an NMR tube under a controlled atmosphere in which no contact with atmospheric<br>
oxygen or moisture was possible.<br>
[0072] The resinous material were separated from the liquid material. The liquid<br>
material was analysed by 29Si liquid-state NMR. The formation of both silanol groups at the<br>
end of and within the PDMS polymeric chains and the formation of new Si-O-Si linkages in<br>
strained polycyclic structures were demonstrated. Analysis of the resinous material by 29Si<br>
solid-state NMR showed exactly the same groups formed e.g. silanol and polycyclic<br>
structures as compared to the liquid fraction but at higher levels of concentration. The 29Si<br>
solid-state NMR chemical shifts were -10.7 ppm for terminal silanol (MOH), -53.1 ppm for<br>
silanol (DOH), -55.0 to — 61.0 for siloxane cyclics (T). In addition a signal attributed to Si-<br>
CH2-Si group was identified at -29.1 ppm. The white powder was analysed by 29Si solid-<br>
state NMR in a magic angle spinning and gate decoupling mode to obtain a semi-quantitative<br>
analysis of the chemical structure. The white powder was found to be an organosilicone<br>
resin.<br>
[0073] The general structure of the resinous material was identical to the material that<br>
was formed and exposed to open laboratory, detailed in example 4. NMR results indicated<br>
that plasma irradiation had modified the chemical structure of the PDMS fluid.<br>
EXAMPLE 8<br>
[0074] A trimethylsilyl-ennmated-polydimethyl-co-hydrogenmethylsiloxane (TMS-t-<br>
PDM-HMS) hereafter called silicone fluid having a viscosity of 33 mPa.s, an average degree<br>
of polymerisation of 60 and containing 70 % of hydrogen methyl siloxy units, was introduced<br>
in a low pressure glow discharge oxygen (99.9995 %) plasma reactor.<br>
[0075] The silicone fluid (2 ml) was placed in a petri dish to increase the surface<br>
/volume ratio. Upon plasma treatment lasting 15 minutes a white powder was collected on<br>
the wall of the chamber.<br>
[0076] The white powder was analysed by 29Si solid-state NMR with a cross-<br>
polarisation magic angle spinning and magic angle spinning inverse gated decoupling modes<br>
to obtain a qualitative and semi-quantitative analyses of the chemical structure. The siloxy<br>
units were identified through the chemical shifts of the peak signals measured in ppm and<br>
referenced to tetramethylsilane. The signals were attributed to the following siloxy units<br>
forming the powder: M (8.6 ppm), D (-20 ppm), DOH or T2 (-56 ppm), T3 (-65.0), Q2, Q3, Q4<br>
(-85 to 115 ppm). The white powder was found to be an MDTQ organosilicone resin also<br>
referred to as an organopolysilicate having the following detailed structure:-<br>
M0.02-D0.16-DH 0.03- DOH 0.19 — T3 0.18 — Q2 0.04 -Q3 0.18 - Q4 0.20<br>
Where M is (CH3)3Si01/2, D is (CH3)2SiO2/2, DH is (CH3)(H)Si02/2, DOH is (CH3)SiO2/2(OH),<br>
T3 is (CH3)Si03/2, Q2 is SiO2/2(OH)2, Q3 is SiO3/2(OH) and Q4 is SiO4/2.<br>
Particles Size analysis of the white organosilicone resin powder was undertaken using a<br>
Coulter LS 230 Laser Particles Size Analyser (from 0.04 to 2000 mm), in water, using the Mie<br>
theory and the standard Fraunhofer optical model calculation. The particle size distribution<br>
of these organosilicone resin is polydispersed and centred (50% in volume) at a particle<br>
diameter of below 110 mm.<br>
Example 9<br>
[0077] A trirnethylsilyl-terminated-polyhydrogenmethylsiloxane (TMS-t-PHMS)<br>
hereafter called silicone fluid having a viscosity of 30 mPa.s, an average degree of<br>
polymerisation of 60 and containing 100 % of hydrogen methyl siloxy units, was introduced<br>
in a low pressure glow discharge oxygen (99.9995 %) plasma reactor.<br>
[0078] The silicone fluid (2 ml) was placed in a petri dish to increase the surface<br>
/volume ratio. Upon plasma treatment lasting 15 minutes a white powder was collected on<br>
the wall of the chamber.<br>
[0079] The white powder was analysed by 29Si solid-state NMR with a cross-<br>
polarisation magic angle spinning and magic angle spinning inverse gated decoupling modes<br>
to obtain a qualitative and semi-quantitative analyses of the chemical structure. The white<br>
powder was found to be an organosilicone resin.<br>
[0080] Examples 2 to 4 show that the PDMS chemical structure is modified in the<br>
same way by either an air or oxygen plasma treatment. Increasing the plasma treatment time<br>
or the residence time in the plasma increases the amount of resinous material formed.<br>
Example 4 shows formation of powder that is a polysiloxane resin. Examples 6 and 7 show<br>
that the transformation of the polysiloxane from linear structure to a three-dimensional<br>
structure is due to plasma treatment alone.<br>
WE CLAIM :<br>
1. A method of forming a gel and/or powder of a metallic oxide, metalloid<br>
