				<td>MIXER AND METHOD FOR MIXING A GAS AND SOLUTION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a mixer providing a powerful pumping capacity. The<br>
mixer is intended for conditions in which the solution or slurry to be<br>
processed is difficult to treat and into which gas is conducted with the<br>
intention of dispersing it evenly and effectively into the solution. The mixing<br>
method is especially suited to a hydrometallurgical process, where the<br>
purpose is to disperse the gas into the solution and obtain effective mixing<br>
both on micro- and macro-level.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
US patent 4,548,765 describes a mixer, in which there are dispersing blades<br>
located above and below a circular plate attached to the mixer shaft and<br>
baffle blades placed at the end of arms outside the circular plate. The centre<br>
of gravity of the blades is below the circular plate. The mixer is intended for<br>
mixing gas, liquid and solids together into a good dispersion, whereby<br>
chemical reactions can proceed in a controlled manner.<br>
In contrast, US patent 7,070,174 describes a mixing apparatus, which<br>
consists of two mixers fixed onto the mixer shaft. The mixer is intended for<br>
closed reactors, for example vertical autoclaves. The purpose of the mixing<br>
apparatus is to disperse gas into a slurry where the gas is fed into the<br>
reactor from above the surface of the slurry.<br>
In the apparatus accordant with US patent 7,070,174, the upper mixer<br>
comprises a central plate attached to the shaft, inner blades attached to the<br>
central plate and outer blades attached to the outer edge of the central plate.<br>
The inner edge of the inner blades above the central plate is made to narrow<br>
outwards in the shape of an arc and below the central plate the inner edge is<br>
straight. The outer edge of the inner blade is vertical all along. The outer<br>
blades are attached directly to the central plate at the same point as the<br>
inner blades. The outer blades are rectangular and their angle of inclination<br>
to the central plate is 30 - 60 degrees. The mixing apparatus also includes a<br>
lower mixer, which consists of a round central plate and blades attached to<br>
its outer edge. The outer edge of the blades and the inner edge above the<br>
central plate are vertical, but the part of the inner edge below the central<br>
plate narrows outwards in the shape of an arc. The purpose of the upper<br>
blades of the mixer is to bring about a vortex that sucks the gas from the<br>
surface of the liquid and to disperse the gas into small bubbles. Since the<br>
upper mixer is not able to achieve effective mixing of the slurry in addition to<br>
dispersing, the mixing apparatus is equipped with a lower mixer with the<br>
purpose of obtaining a good mixing of the slurry itself and further to disperse<br>
the gas bubbles into smaller bubbles and mix them into the slurry. The lower<br>
mixer takes considerably more power than the upper mixer. The mixing<br>
apparatus is intended always to comprise at least two of the mixers<br>
described above.<br>
PURPOSE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The mixers described above are practical for many purposes, but<br>
nevertheless they have proved insufficient in conditions where mixing on the<br>
micro- and macro-level as well as gas dispersion into a solution or slurry is a<br>
vital condition for the success of many processes, and where it is desired to<br>
avoid, for instance, the formation of harmful co-products and wear of the<br>
apparatus.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The essential features of the mixer and method accordant with the invention<br>
will be made apparent in the attached claims.<br>
The invention relates to a mixer providing powerful pumping capacity for<br>
mixing a solution or slurry and gas, whereby the mixer comprises a circular<br>
plate symmetrically attached to the lower end of the shaft, vertical inner<br>
mixer blades radially attached to the outer edge of the plate above and<br>
below it and outer blades attached to the circular plate by means of an arm.<br>
It is typical of the mixer that the blades are located symmetrically in terms of<br>
elevation on either side of the circular plate.<br>
It is also typical of the mixer that the number of both inner and outer blades<br>
is 5 - 8.<br>
In the mixer accordant with the invention, the inner edge of the inner blade,<br>
which includes both the parts above and below the circular plate, is made<br>
curved in the direction of the mixer shaft so that the upper and lower edge of<br>
the blade are horizontal from the outer edge for a distance that is 35-50 % of<br>
the total blade width. The curved inner edge of the inner blade is preferably<br>
shaped like a parabola. The height of the inner blades is of the order of 38 -<br>
46 % and the width 14-20 % of the total mixer diameter. The outer edge of<br>
the inner blade is vertical and extends preferably beyond the circular plate by<br>
a distance that is of the order of 0.5 - 2 % of the diameter of the mixer.<br>
The outer blades in the mixer accordant with the invention are at an angle of<br>
50 - 70°, preferably 60°, to the plane formed by the circular plate. The outer<br>
blades are rectangular in shape and their height is in the region of 3 - 3.5<br>
times their width.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention the inner and outer blades face each<br>
other, i.e. the arm joining the outer blade to the circular plate is attached to<br>
the circular plate at the same point as the inner blade.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention the inner and outer blades are<br>
attached to the circular plate, offset to each other. The inner and outer<br>
blades may be displaced by 0 - 36° to each other. According to one<br>
alternative, the offset between the inner and outer blades can be adjusted.<br>
It is typical of a mixer accordant with the invention that the length of the arms<br>
attaching the outer blades to the circular plate is around 3-4 % of the total<br>
diameter of the mixer.<br>
The mixer accordant with the invention is suitable for use in both<br>
atmospheric and pressurised conditions, i.e. in an autoclave.<br>
The invention also relates to a method for feeding gas into a solution or<br>
slurry, particularly in hydrometallurgical processes. The effective dispersing<br>
of gas into the solution and a good mixing on micro- and macro-level is<br>
achieved by means of one mixer located in an agitated reactor, whereby gas<br>
dispersing and micro-level mixing occur by means of the inner mixer blades<br>
and macro-level mixing by means of the outer mixer blades, with their<br>
combined effect resulting in a flow rising upwards from the walls of the<br>
agitated reactor and turning down near the surface of the liquid to the mixer.<br>
It is typical of the method that the gas is mixed into the solution in a reactor,<br>
where the filling height to diameter is 0.8 - 1.4. Mixing of the gas into the<br>
solution occurs with a mixer that has a power factor Np in the region of 4 -<br>
10.<br>
The method accordant with the invention is particularly suitable for a solution<br>
which is a chromium (Vl)-containing solution and where the gas to be fed is<br>
sulphur dioxide. According to one alternative, the solution is a chromium (VI)-<br>
containing nitric acid-based solution. According to another alternative, the<br>
solution is a chromium (Vl)-containing sulphuric acid-based solution.<br>
The method accordant with the invention is also suitable when the solution to<br>
be treated contains at least one of the metals zinc, nickel or cobalt and the<br>
gas to be fed is a sulphur dioxide- and oxygen-containing gas.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The mixer accordant with the invention is well-suited for instance as a mixer<br>
in an oxidising or reducing gas/solution process in hydrometallurgy, where<br>
effective mixing on micro- and macro-level is required in order for the mixing<br>
process to be successful, for example, to avoid harmful side-reactions.<br>
It is typical of the mixer 1 accordant with the invention that the mixer<br>
suspended from shaft 2 comprises a circular plate 3 attached symmetrically<br>
to the lower end of the shaft, inner mixer blades 4 fixed radially to both the<br>
upper and lower sides of the plate and outer blades 6 attached to the circular<br>
plate by means of an arm 5. In order for the mixing of the material being<br>
treated to become effective enough, when the tip speed of the outer blades<br>
is in the region of 5 - 7 m/s, some significant changes have been made to<br>
the mixer accordant with the invention in comparison with the mixers of the<br>
prior art. The tip speed in question corresponds mainly to the critical speed<br>
after which the wear of the mixing mechanism increases noticeably. A mixer<br>
accordant with the invention enables for instance the effective micro- and<br>
macro-level mixing in full-scale reactor size (50 - 500 m3) to be achieved at a<br>
power level of 1.5 - 5.0 kW/m3, when the tip speed of the mixer is at the level<br>
mentioned above, and the power factor Np of the mixer rises in that case to<br>
between 4 and 10. Generally a power factor of 2.4 - 3.0 is reached with<br>
mixers of the prior art.<br>
The number of both inner and outer blades in a mixer accordant with the<br>
invention is 5 - 8. Gas is fed into the reactor from the lower section towards<br>
the circular plate via a separate feed pipe. If necessary, the mixer shaft may<br>
be made hollow, so that the feed of gas may occur through it to below the<br>
circular plate if so desired. The structure of the mixer is however developed<br>
to be such that it is also able to suck in gas from above the surface of the<br>
liquid. The ratio of the mixer diameter to the agitated reactor is in the region<br>
of 0.35 - 0.40. The mixer is particularly effective when the reactor around it is<br>
in the shape of a vertical cylinder and the ratio of its effective height (filling<br>
height) to the diameter is 0.8 - 1.4. Experts in the field believe that a reactor<br>
should be equipped with two mixers if the reactor height/diameter ratio is<br>
above 1, but in the tests carried out it was found that a good mixing result<br>
could still be achieved at the ratio given above with a mixer accordant with<br>
the invention.<br>
In order to increase the mixing efficiency on both the upper and lower<br>
sections of the mixer, the mixer is formed so that the blades are located<br>
symmetrically with regard to the circular plate, whereby an equally large part<br>
of the blades is above and beneath said circular plate. To improve mixing<br>
efficiency, now the inner edge 7 of the inner blade, which includes the part<br>
both above and below the circular plate, is made curved in the direction of<br>
the mixer shaft, preferably in a parabola, however such that the upper edge<br>
8 and the lower edge 9 of the blade are horizontal from the outer edge<br>
inwards for a distance that is 35-50% of the total width of the blade. The<br>
outer edge 10 of the inner blade is typically vertical and extends preferably<br>
beyond the circumference of the circular plate by a distance that is in the<br>
order of for instance 0 - 2% of the diameter of the mixer. The inner blades<br>
are fitted perpendicular to the circular plate and extend preferably the same<br>
distance above and below the plane formed by the circular plate. The height<br>
of the inner blades is in the region of 38 - 46% and the width 14 - 20% of<br>
the total diameter of the mixer. The inner blades are particularly designed to<br>
disperse gas into a slurry, so they may also be named dispersion blades.<br>
It has been found empirically that the dispersing blades are so effective that<br>
they enable gas to be sucked into the slurry also from above the surface,<br>
whether the gas is fed there or is a gas that is circulating in the reactor. In<br>
addition to acting as dispersing blades, the inner blades also have the<br>
purpose of achieving good micro-level mixing. Often, even though mixing<br>
equipment achieves good macro-level mixing, i.e. extending over the entire<br>
reactor, on the micro-level the mixing between particles and solution or gas<br>
and solution is not effective. It has been found in the tests carried out that<br>
dispersing blades accordant with the invention enable effective micro-level<br>
mixing to be attained.<br>
Arms 5 are attached to the outer edge of the circular plate 3, and in turn<br>
outer blades 6 are fixed onto the outer end of said arms. The outer blades<br>
are rectangular in shape and their height is in the region of 3 - 3.5 times their<br>
width. The width of the outer blade at the point of the circular plate is in the<br>
region of 10 - 20%, preferably 15%, of the total mixer diameter. The blades<br>
are at an angle of 50 - 70°, preferably 60° to the plane formed by the circular<br>
plate. The outer blades are also symmetrical with regard to the circular plate,<br>
i.e. they extend essentially the same distance above and below the plane<br>
formed by the circular plate. The length of the arms 5 attaching the outer<br>
blades to the circular plate is in the region of 3-4 % of the total mixer<br>
diameter. The task of the outer blades is to achieve macro-level mixing, i.e.<br>
to make the solution-gas dispersion mixed by the inner blades circulate in<br>
the reactor in the desired manner.<br>
In the embodiment according to Figure 2 the inner and outer blades are both<br>
6 in number, but the quantity may vary between 5 and 8. The number<br>
depends mostly on the size of the reactor into which the mixer is placed. The<br>
blades in Figure 2 are located so that the inner and outer blades face one<br>
another, i.e. the arm connecting the circular plate to the outer blade is<br>
attached to exactly the same point as the inner blade.<br>
In the embodiment according to Figure 3 there are also 6 outer and 6 inner<br>
blades, but now the blades are attached to the circular plate at a different<br>
point from each other. The blades in Figure 3 are offset to each other by 30<br>
degrees. It is characteristic of the mixer solution according to the invention<br>
that the blades are offset to each other by 0 - 36° depending on the number<br>
of blades and the mixing requirements. When the blades are offset to each<br>
other, twice as many dispersion points are generated around the mixer in the<br>
material to be mixed compared to when the blades face each other. When a<br>
mixer according to Figure 3 is placed in a reactor, which is over 50 m3 in size<br>
and dimensioned in the manner described above, the tip speed of the inner<br>
blades rises to over 4 m/s, in other words clearly into the dispersion zone.<br>
The final result obtained is a more even dispersion of gas into the solution or<br>
slurry in the reactor. The offset is at maximum when the outer blades are<br>
exactly between the inner blades. Thus the maximum offset is between 36 -<br>
22.5° depending on the number of blades. It is also characteristic of the<br>
mixer according to the invention that the offset between the blades can be<br>
adjusted as required.<br>
In the case according to Figure 3, in which the number of both inner and<br>
outer blades is 6, an effective solution for the placement of the inner and<br>
outer blades is that the inner blades are preferably in the region between 20°<br>
before and 10° behind the outer blades in relation to the rotation direction of<br>
the mixer. When the inner blade moves in front, the gas coming from below<br>
the circular plate will rise radially with the releasing eddies from the inner<br>
blades and will fall immediately into the domain of the following outer blades.<br>
The gas is dispersed very evenly when the offset is for instance 20 degrees,<br>
whereby the gas ends up in a wider space to be dispersed by the outer<br>
blades and in that case dispersing efficacy is achieved particularly from the<br>
effect of the upper parts of the circular plate. When the offset is in the region<br>
of 5 degrees, a powerful local dispersing is achieved when the gas and slurry<br>
are discharged upwards and outwards through the small gaps formed by the<br>
inner and outer blades.<br>
The respective location of the inner and outer blades has an especially<br>
powerful effect when the mixer is dimensioned for a reactor with a volume of<br>
over 100 m3. In that case the absolute transfer lengths of the gas are<br>
considerable, but the effect of the distance can be reduced by increasing the<br>
number of mixer blades.<br>
It is typical of the method accordant with the invention that a flow pattern<br>
according to Figure 6 is formed in the agitated reactor. The flow pattern<br>
shows that by means of a mixer 1 accordant with the invention, a solution<br>
flow is formed in the reactor 11 that is firstly directed obliquely downwards,<br>
and is diverted by the reactor wall to flow partially downwards, circulating<br>
back to the mixer. The other part of the flow is diverted upwards and rises<br>
along the reactor walls, and is turned at the centre of the reactor as a result<br>
of the suction effect of the mixer back down to the mixer. In place of the<br>
vertical baffles normally located on the reactor wall it is preferable to use<br>
vertical plates 12, set nearer to the mixer, which are wider than standard<br>
baffles. It is characteristic of the method that effective mixing of a controlled<br>
shape extending throughout the entire reactor is achieved using only one<br>
mixer, with an outer blade tip speed being at most in the region of 5 - 7 m/s,<br>
because the power factor of the mixer accordant with the invention is as<br>
much as 4 - 10. The solution to be treated is fed into the reactor normally<br>
from the lower section via the feed unit 13 and removed from the upper<br>
section of the reactor via the vent unit 14. The gas is fed below the mixer, in<br>
the vicinity of the circular plate (not shown in detail in the drawing). The<br>
mixing method is intended particularly for hydrometallurgical processes.<br>
The mixer and mixing method accordant with the invention are well suited for<br>
mixing that occurs at the prevailing pressure, i.e. in atmospheric conditions.<br>
However, the mixer can also be used in pressurised reactors as in Figure 7<br>
i.e. in an autoclave 15, particularly when the autoclave is a horizontal-model<br>
cylinder, which is divided into compartments. The autoclave in Figure 7 is<br>
seen from the side and only the first two compartments 16 and 17 are visible.<br>
Each compartment is equipped with a mixer accordant with the invention 18<br>
and preferably with four baffles 19. In the same way as was found regarding<br>
atmospheric leaching above, it is also preferable in autoclave leaching to use<br>
baffles that are wider than standard baffles, whereby the same type of<br>
solution flow is achieved as that described in Figure 6, i.e. a powerful<br>
circulation from below upwards at the walls of each autoclave compartment<br>
and downwards in the centre of the compartment towards the mixer. The gas<br>
to be mixed is fed either below the mixer and/or into the pressurised gas<br>
phase above the solution or slurry to be mixed. Thanks to the effective mixer,<br>
it is also possible to suck the gas above the surface of the solution into the<br>
liquid.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1<br>
Three mixers are compared with each other, two of which are accordant with<br>
the prior art and the third accordant with the invention. The first is a mixer of<br>
the prior art, described in US patent 4,548,765, known by the abbreviation<br>
gls, the second an upper mixer type of the mixing apparatus described in US<br>
patent 7,070,174, known by the abbreviation glsw. To facilitate comparison,<br>
the outer blades of the glsw mixer are located on the end of the arm, the<br>
same as in the other mixers and not attached to the circular plate as<br>
described in the patent. The third is a mixer accordant with the invention,<br>
known by the abbreviation blsr. A vertical section of the mixers is shown in<br>
Figure 4.<br>
All the mixers have one interesting characteristic: their power draw can be<br>
changed by changing their location, i.e. height, in the reactor. With all of<br>
them the power take-off increases to a certain value when the mixer is raised<br>
upwards. This is due to the increasing of flow eddies. As the flow hits the<br>
bottom only a simple flow is formed from the centre down and then up along<br>
the sides of the reactor. When the mixer is raised, the flow hits the sidewall<br>
of the reactor, whereby a double toroid is formed: slurry flowing down the<br>
reactor wall turns inwards and rises back below the mixer and another eddy<br>
flow rises up along the wall and returns to the central section above the<br>
mixer. This increase in eddies raises the power draw.<br>
The shaft power is calculated according to the following known equation:<br>
Pshaft = ? Np p N3 D5, where<br>
P shaft = shaft power [W]<br>
? = output correction factor [-], taking account of changes in the mixer<br>
location for example<br>
Np = power factor (property of the mixer) [-]<br>
p = density of medium to be mixed [kg/m3]<br>
N = number of mixer revolutions [1/s]<br>
D = diameter of mixer [m]<br>
The gls mixer is usable when the gas to be dispersed is fed below the mixer<br>
at the central point. Thanks to the negative pressure created behind the<br>
inner blades the gas disperses into the slurry. The outer blades are at an<br>
angle of 45 degrees and enable the attainment of a flow directed obliquely<br>
downwards towards the reactor wall, a double toroid, which raises the power<br>
draw. Successful mixing requires that the mixer is at a sufficient distance<br>
from the bottom, and when the solid particles in the slurry to be treated are<br>
coarse, the mixing efficiency is usually not enough, and a mass of solids<br>
begins to form on the bottom.<br>
The glsw mixer is intended to disperse gas from above the surface of the<br>
liquid, gas that is either fed there or is circulating there during mixing.<br>
Otherwise the same characteristics apply to this mixer as to the gls mixer.<br>
The blsr mixer accordant with the invention has been developed particularly<br>
for the following purposes:<br>
- Dispersing gas fed from both above and below into a slurry,<br>
- Handling chemical mixing processes that require a great deal of energy<br>
(power/volume),<br>
- Mixing abrasive solid particles into a liquid, when their mixing requires<br>
great turbulent energy,<br>
- Particularly for processes, where the mixing efficiency has to extend<br>
right up to the surface of the liquid.<br>
The characteristics described above are shown in Figure 5 and in the<br>
tables below, where the power distributions at different points of the reactor<br>
are itemised. In the comparison, the power of the blsr mixer accordant with<br>
the invention is ascribed a value of 100%, and the other mixers are<br>
compared with this. The location of the mixer in the reactor is the same for<br>
all, as are the mixer diameters. The reactor conditions are also the same in<br>
each case. The tip speed of the mixer calculated from the outer edge of the<br>
inner blades is the same for all, i.e. 6 m/s.<br>
It is also calculated in Figure 5, how much output the mixer is able to provide<br>
the reactor with above and below the mixer. The partial output of the mixers<br>
accordant with the prior art is compared with the output of the blsr mixer. The<br>
result obtained was that the power factor Np of the blsr mixer is in the order<br>
of 1.7 times that of the mixers of the prior art. The output comparison<br>
between the mixers is given again in tabular form:<br>
Tot = total power %<br>
Mix-Y = mixing power in the upper space of the mixer, %<br>
Mix-A = mixing power in the lower space of the mixer, %<br>
<br>
Example 3<br>
The example describes the use of the blsr mixer in the dispersing of a gas<br>
and a solution. An agitated reactor is equipped with wide baffles and a blsr<br>
mixer located on one plane. The combined effect achieved is the effective<br>
dispersing of the gas and a strong flow of the solution from the edges of the<br>
reactor upwards and from the centre back down to the mixer. Thanks to the<br>
powerful flow the majority of the gas bubbles coming to the surface are<br>
sucked back into the solution and return to the mixer, whereby an effective<br>
utilisation of the gas is obtained.<br>
One solution generated in the pickling of refined steel contains hexavalent<br>
chromium (Cr6+), which has to be reduced to trivalent by means of sulphur<br>
dioxide gas. The reduction process in question is generally a problematic<br>
one and becomes particularly difficult when the chromium is in a nitric acid-<br>
based solution. In order for the reduction and dispersing of the sulphur<br>
dioxide in the solution to succeed, the mixing has to be very effective, i.e.<br>
with a power factor between 4 and 10. If the mixing weakens, the following<br>
reactions will take place in the solution, in other words first side-reaction (1),<br>
which leads to further reaction (2), forming harmful NOX gas:<br>
<br>
When the mixing efficiency is sufficient, as in the case accordant with the<br>
invention, the desired reaction is made to occur:<br>
<br>
The reaction is also made to occur in the upper part of the reactor and not<br>
only in the vicinity of the mixer. Thanks to the powerful mixing, even the NOX<br>
gas potentially generated during reduction is made to react further:<br>
<br>
In this case the total reaction is as follows:<br>
<br>
Effective mixing is required in this case due to the large number of ions<br>
involved in the reaction. Thanks to powerful mixing the development of NOX<br>
can be terminated in two ways. Firstly, strong mixing favours the main<br>
reaction, where the number of reactive ions is large, but nevertheless smaller<br>
than the number in the side reaction. Secondly, powerful mixing enables any<br>
possible NOX gas that is generated to react with the hexavalent chromium.<br>
The effective mixing method described above is also advantageous in the<br>
reduction of chromium(VI) when the solution is sulphuric acid based,<br>
because there too it is a question of a large amount of reactive ions and<br>
nevertheless it is desired to get the level of chromium(VI) to the range of less<br>
than one microgram per litre.<br>
Example 4<br>
Another hydrometallurgical process that requires effective mixing in order to<br>
succeed, is induced oxidation. Such a process is typically the combined<br>
removal of manganese and iron from a solution that contains at least one of<br>
the following group of metals: zinc, cobalt or nickel, in which sulphur dioxide<br>
and an oxygen-containing gas are fed into the solution. A powerful mixing<br>
efficiency is needed in the method, so that the reaction (7) forming sulphuric<br>
acid does not become too strong:<br>
<br>
Since the removal of manganese/iron requires accurate pH adjustment, in<br>
addition to oxygen additional neutralising agents are also consumed in this<br>
harmful side reaction.<br>
The mixing equipment that enables powerful mixing to be attained also in the<br>
upper section of the reactor, facilitates the raising of the sulphur dioxide /<br>
oxygen ratio in the feed gas, whereby a strong induction is obtained in the<br>
precipitation reaction (8):<br>
<br>
It is to be noted in reaction (8) that manganese hydroxide is partly formed as<br>
oxyhydroxide. The sulphuric acid that is formed is neutralised with lime for<br>
example to maintain a certain pH value:<br>
<br>
Thanks to effective mixing, lime can be fed to the surface of the liquid in the<br>
reactor, from where the lime is directed to the primary mixing zone of the<br>
mixer. When the lime is fed in this way, it reacts, forming loose particles of<br>
gypsum without causing a disruptive amount of gypsum formation on the<br>
reactor structures.<br>
