DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0013] The following detailed description is directed to certain specific aspects of the invention. However, the invention can be embodied in a multitude of different ways as defined and covered by the claims. It should be apparent that the aspects herein may be embodied in a wide variety of forms and that any specific structure, function, or both being disclosed herein is merely representative. Based on the teachings herein one skilled in the art should appreciate that an aspect disclosed herein may be implemented independently of any other aspects and that two or more of these aspects may be combined in various ways. For example, an apparatus may be implemented or a method may be practiced using any number of the aspects set forth herein. In addition, such an apparatus may be implemented or such a method may be practiced using other structure, functionality, or structure and functionality in addition to or other than one or more of the aspects set forth herein. As an example of some of the above concepts, in some aspects, data transmissions disclosed herein may be transmitted on concurrent channels established based on pulse repetition frequencies. In some aspects, concurrent channels may be established based on time hopping sequences. In some aspects, concurrent channels may be established based on pulse repetition frequencies and time hopping sequences.<br>
[0014] A body area network comprising one or more devices may define a system that provides distributed functionality as each of these devices (or sub-systems of the devices 102) performs certain functions. Moreover, each device may be powered independently. If a device loses power and is no longer functional, it can affect the capabilities of the system. According, in some aspects, a method, system, and apparatus is provided that manages the overall functionality of the network and to maximize the utilization of available power.<br>
[0015] Figure 1 is a block diagram illustrating an example system 100 of wirelessly connected devices 102a, 102b, 102c, and 102d (which are generically referenced herein as the device 102). The system 100 may comprise one or more of a personal area network (PAN) and/or a body area network (BAN). The system 100 may optionally include one or more devices 102a that comprise a longer range, e.g., mobile telephone or other network interface and other device, each of which is configured to communicate over a wireless link 106. Each device 102 may be configured to communicate over the links 106 and at least one other data communications link, e.g., via any suitable wireless or wired<br><br>
any suitable wireless or wired network link. The devices 102 may comprise devices such as headsets and watches (or other portable devices configured to display information such as caller id from a phone and/or messages (or portions thereof) such as email, short message system (SMS) messages, or any other type of data, including data received over the wireless links 106 and 108. Other examples of devices 102 may include input/output devices, sensors, and medical devices. Each of the devices 102 may communicate with one, two, or any number of the other devices 102.<br>
[0016] One or more of the devices 102 may detect the presence of the other devices 102 when the other devices 102 initially communicate over the link 106. Two or more devices 102 may be paired through an exchange of messages over the link 106. For example, two devices 102 may pair when one of the two devices 102 first detects (by receiving a message over the wireless link 106) the other device 102. The pairing process may be based at least partly on a user's authorization of the pairing. The paired group of the devices 102 may define a particular personal or body area network.<br>
[0017] As discussed further below, in some aspects the communications link 106 a pulsed-based physical layer. For example, the physical layer may utilize ultra-wideband pulses that have a relatively short length (e.g., on the order of a few nanoseconds) and a relatively wide bandwidth. In some aspects, an ultra-wide band may be defined as having a fractional bandwidth on the order of approximately 20% or more and/or having a bandwidth on the order of approximately 500 MHz or more. The fractional bandwidth is a particular bandwidth associated with a device divided by its center frequency. For example, a device according to this disclosure may have a bandwidth of 1.75 GHz with center frequency 8.125 GHz and thus its fractional bandwidth is 1.75/8.125 or 21.5%.<br>
[0018] Those skilled in the art would understand that infornation and signals may be represented using any of a variety of different technologies and techniques. For example, data, instructions, commands, information, signals, bits, symbols, and chips that may be referenced throughout the above description may be represented by voltages, currents, electromagnetic waves, magnetic fields or particles, optical fields or particles, or any combination thereof<br><br>
[0019] Figure 2 is a block diagram illustrating an example of a wireless device 102. The device 102 includes a processor 202 that is in communication with a memory 204 and a network interface 206 for communicating via the wireless link 106. Optionally, the device 102 may also include one or more of a display 210, a user input device 212 such as a key, touch screen, or other suitable tactile input device, a loudspeaker 214 comprising a transducer adapted to provide audible output based on a signal received over the wireless link 106 and/or a microphone 216 comprising a transducer adapted to provide audible input of a signal that may be transmitted over the wireless link 106. For example, a watch may include the display 210 adapted to provide a visual output based on a signal received via the wireless communication link. A medical or other sensor device may include one or more input devices 212 that include a transducer or sensor adapted to generate at least one sensed signal or sensed data to be transmitted via the wireless communication link 106. More examples of devices 102 are discussed below with reference to Figure 2.<br>
[0020] The network interface 206 may include any suitable antenna (not shown), a receiver 220, and a transmitter 222 so that the exemplary device 102 can communicate with one ore more devices over the wireless link 106. Optionally, the network interface 206 may also have processing capabilities to reduce processing requirements of the processor 202.<br>
[0021] Optionally, the device 102 may include a second network interface 208 that communicates over the network 110 via a link 108. For example, the device 102 may provide connectivity to the other network 110 (e.g., a wide area network such as the Internet) via a wired or wireless communication link. Accordingly, the device 102 may enable other devices 102 (e.g., a Wi-Fi station) to access the other network, hi addition, it should be appreciated that one or more of the devices 102 may be portable or, in some cases, relatively non-portable. The second network interface 208 may transmit and receive RF signals according to the IEEE 802.11 standard, including IEEE 802.11(a), (b), or (g), the BLUETOOTH standard, and/or CDMA, GSM, AMPS or other known signals that are used to communicate within a wireless cell phone network. In addition, the second network interface 208 may comprise any suitable wired network interface such as Ethernet (IEEE 802.3).<br>
[0022]      The device 102 may optionally include a battery 231 to provide power to<br><br>
to one or more components of the device 102. The device 102 may comprise at least one of a mobile handset, a personal digital assistant, a laptop computer, a headset, a vehicle hands free device, or any other electronic device. In addition, the device 102 may comprise one or more of a biomedical sensor, biometric sensor, a pacemaker, or any other device for measuring or affecting a human body. In particular, the teachings herein may be incorporated into (e.g., implemented within or performed by) a variety of the devices 102. For example, one or more aspects taught herein may be incorporated into a phone (e.g., a cellular phone), a personal data assistant ("PDA"), an entertainment device (e.g., a music or video device), a headset (e.g., headphones, an earpiece, etc.), a microphone, a biometric sensor (e.g., a heart rate monitor, a pedometer, an EKG device, a keyboard, a mouse, etc.), a user I/O device (e.g., a watch, a remote control, a light switch, etc.), a tire pressure monitor, a computer, a point-of-sale device, an entertainment device, a hearing aid, a set-top box, or any other suitable device.<br>
[0023] The components described herein may be implemented in a variety of ways. Referring to Figure 2, the device or apparatus 102 is represented as a series of interrelated functional blocks that may represent functions implemented by, for example the processor 202, software, some combination thereof, or in some other manner as taught herein. For example, the processor 202 may facilitate user input via the input devices 212. Further, the transmitter 222 may comprise a processor for transmitting that provides various functionality relating to transmitting information to another device 102. The receiver 220 may comprises a processor for receiving that provides various functionalities relating to receiving information from another device 102 as taught herein.<br>
[0024] As noted above. Figure 2 illustrates that in some aspects these components may be implemented via appropriate processor components. These processor components may in some aspects be implemented, at least in part, using structure as taught herein. In some aspects, a processor may be adapted to implement a portion or all of the functionality of one or more of these components. In some aspects one or more of the components represented by dashed boxes are optional.<br>
[0025] In some aspects, the device or apparatus 102 may comprise an integrated circuit. Thus, the integrated circuit may comprise one or more processors that provide the functionality of the processor components illustrated in Figure 2. For example, in some aspects a single processor may implement the functionality of the illustrated processor<br><br>
illustrated processor components, while in other aspects more than one processor may implement the functionality of the illustrated processor components, in addition, in some aspects the integrated circuit may comprise other types of components that implement some or all of the functionality of the illustrated processor components.<br>
[0026] Figure 3 is a block diagram illustrating an example of the transmitter 222 of the device 102. As would be apparent to one of skill in the art, in the illustrated block diagram of Figure 3, logical modules of the device 102 are illustrated in terms of a layered, abstract description for a communications network. As noted below, each layer may comprise one or more logical modules that may be implemented in software, hardware, or any suitable combination of both. The transmitter 222 may include (i) an application layer 401 that provides information to a data link or media access control (MAC) layer 402 for transmission, (ii) a media access control (MAC) layer 402 that receives data from the application layer 401 and provides it to a physical layer 404, and (iii) a physical (PHY) layer 404 that receives data from the MAC layer 402 and transmits the data over the wireless channel 106. hi the illustrated transmitter 222, the PHY layer includes a pulse generator 406, a coding and modulation block 408, and a transmit block 410. A phase locked loop (PLL) (not shown) may provide timing signals to the PHY layer. The pulse generator 406 generates waveforms such as Gaussian pulse waveforms. The coding and modulation block 408 codes the information signal provided by the MAC layer 402 using a coding scheme such as convolutional coding, block coding or concatenated coding and modulates the pulse signal based on the coded information signal using a schenie such as pulse position modulation, pulse amplitude modulation, or transmitted reference modulation. The transmit block 410 transmits the modulated pulse signal. Functions of the transmit block 410 may include amplifying the modulated pulse signal for transmission and providing the signal to an antenna.<br>
[0027] Figure 4 is a block diagram illustrating an example of the receiver 220 of the device 102. As would be apparent to one of skill in the art, in the illustrated block diagram of Figure 4, logical modules of the device 102 are illustrated in terms of a layered, abstract description for a communications network. As noted below, each layer may comprise one or more logical modules that may be implemented in software, hardware, or any suitable combination of both. In Figure 4, the receiver 220 includes the application layer 401 and the MAC layer 402. The PHY layer 404 is in communication with the MAC<br><br>
with the MAC layer 402. The PHY layer 404 of the receiver includes a demodulation and decoding block 508 and a receive block 510. The receive block 510 may include components (not shown) that may comprise an antenna, a power amplifier, and other suitable receiver components. The receive block 510 receives a wireless signal and provides that signal to the demodulation and decoding block 508, which demodulates and decodes the signal and provides received data to the MAC layer 402.<br>
[0028] The receiver 220 and the transmitter 222 may employ a variety of wireless physical layer schemes. For example, the physical layer 404 of the receiver 220 and the transmitter 222 may utilize some form of CDMA, TDMA, OFDM, OFDMA, or other modulation and multiplexing schemes.<br>
[0029] Power and/or functionality management is sometimes limited to management of the capabilities of a single device. For example, a user can adjust the backlighting settings of a mobile phone. Similarly, a user can adjust the functionality of a laptop computer to put the device to sleep, dim the screen, or shut down the hard drive when certain conditions are met. Devices 102 in a personal or body area network can be desirably configured to communicate resource information and functional assignment data to distribute functionality between the devices 102 to better utilize power and processing capabilities of the various devices 102. For example, in some aspects, resource consumption associated performing functions of the system 100 can be shifted between devices 102 in the system 100, e.g., from devices 102 that have small power or other resource capabilities to more capable devices 102. Such resources may include battery power, data communication resources, data processing resources, display resources, audio input or output resources, and any other suitable resources of an electronic device 102 (such as the examples of devices 102 discussed above with reference to Figure 1).<br>
[0030] Figure 5 is a flowchart illustrating an example of a method 600 of allocating processing resources such as in the example system 100. The method 600 begins at a block 602 in which, e.g., the processor 202 at a first device 102 (e.g., the device 102a) in communication with at least a second device 102 (e.g., the device 102b) via the wireless link 106, monitors at least one resource for performing at least one function. The resource may comprise resources of the first device 102a, or one or more second devices 102, including the device 102b, in the system 100. Monitoring information about the resource may be communicated via the wireless link 106 periodically to dynamically allocate the<br><br>
periodically to dynamically allocate the function as available resources change over time due to changes in the availability of resources (e.g. power consumption) or availability of devices 102 in the system 100. Alternatively (or in addition), monitoring information about the resource may be communicated via the wireless link 106 when the second device(s) 102b pairs with the first device 102a or when the second device(s) 102b enters or reenters the system 100 (e.g., when the device is powered up or is moved into communications range of the wireless link 106).<br>
[0031] Moving to a block 604, the processor 202 of the device 102a determines whether to assign the at least one function to the at least one second device 102b. The determination is based on information that is indicative of the at least function and indicative of the at least one resource of the at least one second device 102b. As noted above, the determination may be based on resource and function data that is received dynamically in time, e.g., based on periodically received resource information as resource availability changes over time. Alternatively, or in addition, the devices 102 such as the device 102b may be configured to provide resource information when resource availability changes or changes by a specified amount. Upon determining that a function is to be assigned, the function may be assigned via the wireless link 106. The function may be assigned to one or more of the second devices, e.g., the devices 102b, 102c, 102d, or may be assigned to the first device 102a, depending on the determination.<br>
[0032] The determining may be based on numerous rules or heuristics. For example, the devices 102 may define or specify thresholds reserving a certain percentage of battery for certain functionality (e.g., a mobile handset device 102 may define power limits based on a minimum number of incoming and outgoing voice calls or minutes).<br>
[0033] Moreover, in addition to determining to which device 102 a function is to be assigned, the determining may determine when, or if, to assign and perform the function. For example, the determining may adjust the frequency of certain operations (e.g. the polling between external devices 102) based on availability of resources such as battery power at the various devices 102. Further, the determining may be used to adjust when and on which of the devices 102 to perform certain operational settings to allow the system 100 to continue performing in a gracefully degraded mode (e.g. dim displays under certain conditions to preserve power). For example, in an example of the system 100 in which one of the devices 102 is configured to receive or otherwise acquire data (e.g., sensor data), a<br><br>
sensor data), a first of the devices 102, which may be the sensor device 102, a coordinating device 102, or data storage device, may determine based on power or storage resources whether to assign storage of data from the sensor device 102 to a particular one of the devices 102 in the system.<br>
[0034] This determination can be dynamic and change over time as resource availability changes. Moreover, the devices 102 can be configured to transfer results of or other information associated with performing certain functions when those functions are assigned to a different device. For example, a particular device such as a mobile handset 102 can store data from a sensor based on a determination regarding the storage function when the sensor device 102 first begins providing sensor data. At a later time, the storage function and the previously stored data can be assigned (and transferred) to another device 102 that can more efficiently receive and store the data or which has greater storage capacity.<br>
[0035] The determining may be based on past resource usage, availability of resources, resource capacity, resource reserves, and on predictions of future resource usage or demand, e.g., predictions based on present usage. For example, the determining may be based on predicting future usage and remaining battery life based on individual battery states of one or more of the devices 102. The determining may be formulated as an optimization problem based on an objective function to be maximized or minimized. An objective function may include a cost function or any suitable functional relationship derived from any objective such as maximizing, minimizing, or otherwise substantially optimizing consumption of a resource such as power reserves, storage. The calculation of the objective function may be based on one or more resources of one or more of the devices 102 so as to allow the objective function to optimize for an individual device or to optimize resources across a number of devices. Moreover, the objective function may be calculated based on resources of each device that may be the same or different. For example, the objective function may consider tradeoffs of memory versus storage versus communications costs by being based on both types of resources. Resources (functionality and power) may then be allocated over time based on various factor such as definitions of functions or demands to be provided by a particular example of the system 100, a defmition of the devices 102 in the particular example system 100 and the power or functionality provided by each of the devices 102.    In some aspects, certain functionality may be<br><br>
may be provided by multiple sources (e.g. storage capabilities).<br>
[0036] As noted above, the determining may be based on particular constraints or threshold associated with the overall example of the system 100 or of the particular devices 102 in the system, or particular resources of the devices 102. For example, a user may configure a setting on one or more of the devices 102 directing the device 102 to maintain a certain amount of power for emergency situations. The determining may therefore be based on maintaining this reserve and functions such as processing data, storing data, or communicating data assigned to a different device 102 to maintain this reserve.<br>
[0037] By optimizing resource utilization, functionality can be shifted to devices that are more efficient, or which can more efficiently perform the particular function at a particular time, resulting in prolonged battery life, at least in aggregate. For example, certain conditions may trigger the display in the mobile device to be powered off and information conveyed in an alternate display of a watch that may consume less power. Similarly, if a given resource is unavailable (e.g. phone-based storage), this functionality can be shifted to another device (e.g. audio player) that can temporarily perform this function (storage) and then forward the stored data when the primary device becomes available. Thus, for example, the device 102a may assign an intermediate storage function to the device 102b, which may subsequently transfer the data to another device 102c. Continuing this example, the data stored on the device 102b may be generated by another device such as the device 102d.<br>
[0038] Examples of the system 100 may include a network coordinator device (NCD) 102a that is configured to perform the determining and/or assignment of functions. In other examples of the system 100, each device 102a determines whether to assign particular functions to one or more other devices 102b in the system 100 and instructs or requests that other device 102b to perform the function based on the determination. The device 102b may perform the function and provide results back to the device 102a, or to another device 102c or 102d. Thus, the function may be offloaded from one of the devices 102a, 102c, or 102d, to the device 102b and the results returned to the corresponding device 102a, 102c, or 102d for further processing or action based on any results of performing the function.<br><br>
[0039] In one example of the system 100, the device 102a comprises a headset that has one or more resources for performing particular functions (e.g., MPS decompression, echo cancellation, side tone, etc). Based on monitoring such resources of another device 102b, which may comprise a mobile handset, that has similar capabilities, the headset 102 may assign those functions to itself or to the headset. The determination of where to assign the function may be based on power reserves of each device, and may change over time. For example, the headset 102a may assign one or more of the functions to the handset 102b and shut down its own resources (e.g., circuits) for performing those functions to save power locally. Further, at a later time when the battery of the handset 102b drops below a specified or defined threshold, the headset 102a reassigns the MP3 decompression to its own decompression circuit. Similarly, the headset 102a may stream MP3 music from a FLASH dongle device 102c that does not have MPS decompression resources and assign and perform this function to itself (the headset 102a).<br>
[0040] In another example, a heart rate monitor sensor 102a may send measured heart rate to a watch device 102b. Later, based on monitoring power resources, the heart rate monitor may offload the heart rate calculation and assign the heart rate determination to a mobile handset device 102c, to which the heart sensor 102 a sends raw sensor data. The handset device 102c then sends the measured heart rate the watch device 102b. In addition, if for example the heart rate monitor maintains a log of heart rate over time, the handset 102c may also send the measured heart rate back to the sensor 102a for logging. Alternatively, the heart rate sensor 102a may also determine that it should offload the logging to another device 102, such as the mobile handset 102c based on power or storage requirements. The mobile handset 102c may comprise intermediate storage until another device such as a laptop 102d connects to the sensor 102a to obtain the log. The sensor 102a may direct the laptop 102d to at least partly obtain the log from the handset 102c.<br>

In the illustrated example, the device 102 comprises a means or an integrated circuit (IC) 952 for communicating with at least one second device 102 over a wireless link 106. The IC 952 may comprise the receiver 220 and transmitter 222 of Figures 2 - 4. The device 102 also comprises a means or an IC 956 for monitoring at least one resource for performing at least<br><br>
least one function. The IC 956 may comprise the processor 202 of Figure 2. The device 102 also comprises a means or an IC 958 for determining whether to assign the at least one function to the at least one second device 102.

The IC 958 may comprise the processor 202 of Figure 2.<br>
[0042] In view of the above, one will appreciate that the disclosure addresses how to enhance functionality such as battery life, including managing and adjusting the functionality and power consumption of multiple devices configured in a body area network and adjusting and/or shifting functionality from one device to another based on specified thresholds. In some aspects, an objective function defined for a collection of devices by allocating functionality and power across multiple devices can be maximized or minimized. Accordingly, resources of individual devices 102 may be shared across the system 100 in a way that decreases degradation due to failures or lack of available power in a particular device 102.<br>
