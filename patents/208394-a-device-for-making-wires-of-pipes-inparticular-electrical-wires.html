TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present inention relates to an arrangement for marking wires or pipes, in particular electric wires, in the form of an annular or sleeve-shaped body manufactured in one piece and made of an elastic material, preferably plastic, which body is intended to bear one or more marking symbols and comprises a yoke-shaped outer part with two outer legs which serve as side walls and, at their lower endsj merge with an inner yoke-shaped part, which extends up between the legs, with two inner legs and a web portion joining the upper ends of these togeter, which portion, together with the surrounding yoke-shaped outer part, delimits a tunnel-shaped passage for a wire or a pipe which is to be marked-<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Arrangement of this type, which may also be referred to as marking sleeves, have long been used for marking in particular electric wires and cables, but are also used for marking pneumatic and hydraulic pipes.<br>
3.<br>
By virtue of the inner yoke-shaped partf the web portion of which forms a support for a wire which is guided through the marking sleeve, a number of bellows-like folds are formed, which afford an expansion possibility for the sleeve. One and the same marking sleeve can then be used for wires of diameters which vary within a given range. It is therefore possible to cover a diameter range from roughly 1 mm to roughly 16 mm by using marking sleeves of four standard sizes.<br>
The marking sleeves can either be made in the form of relatively small rings, each intended to bear a marking symbol, a, number of rings then being positioned next to one another on a wire so as to bring about a sequence of a number of marking symbols, or alternatively the marking sleeve can be made of greater length, in which case one and the same sleeve can bear a sequence of marking symbols.<br>
The marking symbols can either be printed directly onto the upper part of the sleeve? which part connects the upper edges of the outer legs of the sleeve, or alternatively be printed on<br>
4-<br>
separate labels which are inserted into an upper? longitudinal pocket of the sleeve- The sleeve® are suitably manufactured by extrusion of a relatively soft plastic material.<br>
Marking sleeves of the type indicated above? which are each to be capable of being used on wires of different diametersj should have two characteristics, which can be difficult to combine- The fxrst characteristic is that the sleeves, after they have been threaded onto a wire from one of its ends, are to be secured in the desired position without risk that they will rotate on the wire or be displaced along it, which requires good friction. The second characteristics, which is difficult to combine with the first, is that the sleeves are to be easy to thread onto a wire, that is to say the friction between the sleeve and the wire is to be as low as possible during threading-on. This applies particularly in the case of longer sleeves.<br>
5.<br>
THE OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
One main object of the present invention is to produce a marking sleeve of the type described abovej which retains the capacity of previous sleeve for being secured in the desired position on a wire but which is easier to thread onto the wire than those previously known.<br>
The  invention is based on the insight thar this can  be achieved  by virtue of the fact that the working sleeve is  nade with  weakened  portions  which serve as  hinges  and  facilitate deformation  of the sleeve during threading onto a wire but  do not appreciably affect the grip on the wirei when the sleeve  has taken up the desired position on the wire.<br>
6.<br>
According to the present invention» the particularly characteristic feature of an arrangement of the type indicated in the first paragraph is then that the outer surface of each of the outer legs is made with at least one longitudinal groove* and that the mutually facing surfaces of each of the inner legs are made with at least one longitudinal groove, which grooves form deformation indications which facilitate deformation of the annular or sleeve-shaped bodyi when a wire or a pipe is guided through the tunnel—shaped passage.<br>
By virtue of the fact that deformation of the marking sleeve is facilitated) its threading onto a wire is simplified) while the elasticity in the material still brings about a secure grip on the wire when the sleeve has been guided into place. Owing to the fact that the deformation indications are made in the form of longitudinal groovesj manufacture of the sleeve by extrusion is not made more difficult.<br>
7.<br>
In order to facilitate pressing-down of the inner yoke-shaped part in the sleeve * which part serves as a supportj the rounded transition between each outer and inner leg is suitably made with a longitudinal groove on the outside of the rounded portion. A groove is preferably also arranged on each side of the rounded portion essentially at the transition between this and the respective leg.<br>
In an especially preferred embodiment» each of the outer legs is moreover provided with a longitudinal groove essentially in the middle of the leg and a longiktudinai groove along the upper edge of the legt and the mutually facing surfaces of the inner legs are each provided with a longitudinal groove along the upper edge of the respective leg-<br>
The invention will be described in a greater detail below with reference to the embodiments shown by way of example in the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES IN THE ACCOMPANYINS DRAWINQS<br>
Figs  1  and  2 show two embodiments of  a  marking  sleeve according to the invention.<br>
8<br>
Fig.  3 is an end view of the marking sleeve  according to FiQ- 1 during its threading onto a wire.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Figs,  I and 2 show two examples of  marking  sleeves^ the general shape of which is previously known- They are extruded in  a  relatively soft plastic material and  each  comprises  a yoke-shaped  part  with  two side walIs 1, 2  which  are  joined together at their upper ends via a web portion 3. At their  lower ends, the outer legs merge with an inner yoke-shaped part,  which extends  up between the legs, with two inner legs 4, 5 and a  web portion 6 joining the upper ends of these together- This portion, together  with  the surrounding yoke-shaped outer part,  forms  a tunnel-shaped  passage  of a height H for a wire onto  which  the sleeve  is to be threaded. In this connect ioni the web portion  6 forms a bottom suport for the wire.<br>
9.<br>
The  sleeve  according  to  Fig.1  is  made  with   a<br>
long1 tudinal  pocket 7 which extends above the web portion 3  and<br>
is  intended  to  receive a marking labeln 8  provided  with  the desired narking symbols.<br>
In  the embodiment according to Fig.2, the  marking symbols  are  intended  to  be  printed  directly  onto  the  web portion 3.<br>
Marking sleeves according to Figs- 1 and 2 can be used for wires of diamters lying with a given range, the inner yoke-shaped part forming a number of expansion folds of the profile. These allow the web portion 6 to be pressed downward by a wire end of a diameter greater than the height H of the passage through the marking sleeve. The outer legs 1 and 2 of the sleeve will then be pressed outward by the wire end.<br>
10<br>
When a wire which is relatively thick in relation to the area of the tunnel-shaped passage is guided through» appreciable resistance to the wire being guided through can be encountered. The reason for this is inter alia that the wire end has to "plough its way" through the sleeve* the relatively soft material of which is pressed outward only directly in front of the end of the wire.<br>
In order to facilitate guiding-through of the wire* a sleeve according to the invention isj as 1lustrated in Figs- 1 and 2, made with a number of longitudinal grooves which form deformation indications which facilitate deformation of the sleeve in connection with threading onto a wire- By making use of such longitudinal groovesj it has been possible to establish that the material of the sleeve in front of the wire end tends to be pressed outward further in front of the wire end than in the case of a sleeve which has no grooves. This means that the friction forces in particular toward the front portion of the wire are reducedi which facilitates threading-on.<br>
11.<br>
Figs, 1 and 2 show an embodiment which is preferred according to the invention, in which the outer legs 1 and 2 are each provided with three longiudinal grooves 9» 10 and 11i of which the groove 10 runs essentially along a center line of each leg, while the other two grooves 9 and 11, run along the upper end, respectively, lower edge of each leg. The outer legs 1 and 2 merge with respective inner legs 4, 5 via rounded portions 12* 13 which each leave a longitudinal groove 14 along their lower part-The inner legs 4, 5 are each provided with two grooves on the mutually facing surfaces, which grooves run along the upper end * respectively, lower edge of each leg.<br>
Fig 3 shows a marking sleeve according to Fig- 1 during threading  onto  a wire 17 of a diameter  which  is  considerably greater  than the height H of the passage through the sleeve-  In this  connection, as can be seen, the inner yoke-shaped part  with its  web  portion 6, which serves as a support  surface  for  the wire,  has been prssed downward while the outer legs 1, 2  of  the sleeve have been bent out. By means of the grooves shown, this deformation of the sleeve is simplified, and a shape we11 adapted<br>
12-<br>
to the wire 17 is obtained in the deformed state as well. Even  a wire  of the diameter shown can therefore be pushed  through  the marking sleeve relatively easily, at the same time as the sleeve will be secured firmly on the wire after it has been guided into the desired position-<br>
The embodiment shown comprises a number of grooves in the various legs. An appreciable effect can nevertheless already be obtained with a smaller number of grooves. It is therefore possible to make use of a groove which runs essentially centrally on each leg and is suitably complemented by a groove in each of the rounded portions which interconnect the respective pairs of legs.<br>
The exact shape of the grooves and also their positioning can be varied as desired as long as they perform the function of bringing about weakenings which serve as deformation indications and facilitate threading of the sleeve onto a wire but do not appreciably worsen the grip around the wire? when the sleeve is located in the desired position on it.<br>
