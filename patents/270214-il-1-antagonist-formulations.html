				<td>BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001] The present invention is directed to pharmaceutical formulations comprising agents<br>
capable of inhibiting interleukin-1 (IL-1), and to methods for making and using such<br>
formulations.<br>
Statement of Related Art<br>
[0002] Interleukin-1 (IL-1) antagonists capable of blocking or inhibiting the biological action of<br>
IL-1, have been described. An example IL-1 antagonist, an IL-1 trap, is described in U.S. Patent<br>
Publication No. 2003/0143697, published 31 July 2003. An IL-1 trap is an IL-1-specific fusion<br>
protein comprising two IL-1 receptor components and a multimerizing component.<br>
[0003] Lyophilization (freeze drying under controlled conditions) is commonly used for long<br>
term storage of proteins. The lyophilized protein is substantially resistant to degradation,<br>
aggregation, oxidation, and other degenerative processes while in the freeze dried state {see,<br>
for example, U.S. 6,436,897).<br>

sequence of SEQ ID NO:10, atapH of about 6.5. Citrate (less than or equal to about 0.15 mM)<br>
and poiysorbate (less than or equal to about 0.005%) may be present.<br>
[0009] In a second aspect, the invention features a pre-lyophilization IL-1 antagonist<br>
formulation that consists essentially of about 20 mM histidine, about 1.5% PEG 3350, abcut<br>
0.5% glycine, about 25 mM arginine, about 1.0% sucrose, and about 40 mgyml of the IL-1 rusion<br>
protein having the sequence of SEQ ID NO:10, at a pH of about 6,5, wherein the pre- .<br>
lyophilization formulation does not contain a preservative, a phosphate buffer, more than trace<br>
amounts of NaCI, and/or more than 1.5% sucrose. Citrate may be present in amounts of less<br>
than about 0.15 mM and up to about 0.005-0.01% poiysorbate 20 may also be present.<br>
[0010] In a third aspect, the invention features a method of producing a lyophiiized formulation<br>
of an IL-1 antagonist, comprising subjecting the pre-lyophilization IL-1 antagonist formulation of<br>
the invention to lyophilization to generate a lyophiiized IL-1 antagonist formulation. The<br>
lyophiiized formulation may be lyophiiized by any method known in the art for lyophiiizing a<br>
liquid. '<br>
[0011] In a fourth related aspect, the invention features a method of producing a reconstituted<br>
ty9phiJfc^..fPrm.M.Iat.iÂ°.i]i of an IL-1.antagonist, comprising reconstituting.the lypphilized<br>
formulation of the invention to a reconstituted formulation. In one embodiment, the reconstituted<br>
formulation is twice the concentration of the pre-lyophilized formulation, e.g., the method of the<br>
invention comprises: (a) producing a pre-lyophilization formulation of an IL-1 antagonist<br>
consisting of about 20 mM histidine, about 1.5% PEG 3350, about 0.5% glycine, about 25 mM<br>
arginine, about 1,0% sucrose, and about 40 mg/ml of an IL-1 protein antagonist, at a pH of<br>
about 6.5; (b) subjecting the pre-lyophilized formulation of step (a) to lyophilization; and (c)<br>
reconstituting the lyophiiized formulation of step (b) to a composition consisting of about 40 mM<br>
histidine, about 3% PEG 3350, about 1% glycine, about 50 mM arginine, about 2.0% sucrose,<br>
and about 80 mg/ml of the IL-1 protein antagonist, wherein the reconstituted formulation may<br>
further contain about 0.2 mM citrate and/or about 0.008% poiysorbate 20. In a specific<br>
embodiment, the IL-1 antagonist is an IL-1 trap fusion protein as shown in SEQ ID NO;2, 4, 6, 8,<br>
10, 12,14,16,18, 20, 22, 24, 26. More preferably, the IL-1 trap is the trap shown in SEQ ID<br>
NO: 10. In separate embodiments, the reconstituted formulation is 3 times the concentration of<br>
the pre-lyophilized formulation, e.g., a 20 mg IL-1 antagonist protein/ml pre-lyophilization<br>
formulation is reconstituted to a final formulation of 60 mg IL-1 antagonist protein/ml. Generally,<br>
the lyophilized formulation is reconstituted with sterile water suitable for injection. In one<br>
embodiment, the reconstitution liquid may be bacteriostatic water.<br>
[0012] In specific embodiments of the method of producing a reconstituted lyophilized<br>
formulation, a pre-lyophilization solution is present in a vial as a 40 mg IL-1 antagonist protein<br>
per ml solution of pre-lyophilization formulation, which is lyophilized and reconstituted to an <br>
mg/ml solution. In another embodiment, a 20 mg/ml pre-lyophilization solution is lyophilized and<br>
reconstituted to a 40 mg/ml solution. In another embodiment, a 25 mg/ml pre-lyophilization<br>
solution is lyophilized and reconstituted to a 50 mg/ml solution. In another embodiment, a 12.5<br>
mg/ml pre-lyophilization solution is lyophilized and reconstituted to a 25 mg/ml solution. In<br>
another embodiment, a 12.5 mg/ml pre-lyophilization solution is lyophilized and reconstituted to<br>
a 50 mg/ml solution. In another embodiment, a 25 mg/ml pre-lyophilization solution is<br>
lyophilized and reconstituted to a 75 mg/ml solution. In another embodiment, a 40 mg/ml prelyophilization<br>
solution is lyophilized and reconstituted to a 120 mg/ml solution. In another<br>
embodiment, a 40 mg/ml pre-lyophilization solution is lyophilized and reconstituted to a 20<br>
mg/ml solution. Preferably, the reconstituted lyophilized formulation does not contain a<br>
preservative. In another embodiment, the reconstituted formulation includes up to 30% sucrose<br>
and one or more preservatives. .<br>
[0013] In a fifth aspect, the invention features a stable liquid formulation of an IL-1 antagonist,<br>
comprising an IL-1 antagonist protein capable of binding to and inhibiting the biological action of<br>
IL-1, a buffer, an organic co-solvent, and one or more thermal stabilizers, In a specific<br>
embodiment, the IL-1 antagonist is an IL-1 trap fusion protein as shown in SEQ ID N0:2, 4, 6, 8,<br>
10, 12,14,16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26. More preferably, the IL-1 trap is the trap shown in SEQ ID<br>
NO:10, In one embodiment, the buffer is a phosphate buffer. In one embodiment, the organic<br>
co-solvent agent is PEG, preferably PEG 3350. In one embodiment, the thermal stabilizers are<br>
NaCI and/or sucrose. More preferably, the thermal stabilizers are both NaCI and sucrose.<br>
[0014] In a specific embodiment, the stable liquid formulation of an IL-1 antagonist comprises<br>
5-100 mM phosphate buffer, 0.5-3% PEG, 25-150 mM NaCI, 5-30% sucrose, 10-500 mg/ml of<br>
an IL-1 trap protein, at a pH of about 6-6.5. In a more specific embodiment, the stable liquid<br>
formulation of an IL-1 antagonist comprises 10 mM phosphate buffer, 3% PEG 3350, 50 mM<br>
NaCI, 5-20% sucrose, 12.5-50 mg/m! of an IL-1 trap protein, at a pH of about 6-6.5.<br>
Additionally, low or trace amounts of a citrate buffer or polysorbate may be present. The stable<br>
liquid formulation of the IL-1 antagonist of the invention exhibits little or no precipitation as<br>
determined by visual inspection after storage of a 50 mg/ml IL-1 trap formulation for up to about<br>
29 months at 5Â°C. Further, little or no aggregation is observed as determine by size-exclusion<br>
chromatography, e.g., HPLC, after storage of a 50 mg/ml IL-1 trap formulation for up to about <br>
months at 5Â°C.<br>
[0015] Other objects and advantages will become apparent from a review of the ensuing<br>
detailed description.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0016] The present invention is not limited to particular methods, and experimental conditions<br>
described, as such methods and conditions may vary. It is also to be understood that the<br>
terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not<br>
intended to be limiting unless indicated, since the scope of the present invention will be limited<br>
only by the appended claims.<br>
[0017] As used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular forms "a", "an", and<br>
"the" include plural references unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus for example,<br>
references to "a method" include one or more methods, and/or steps of the type described<br>
herein and/or which will become apparent to those persons skilled in the art upon reading this<br>
disclosure.<br>
[0018] Unless stated otherwise, all technical and scientific terms and phrases used herein have<br>
the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which the<br>
invention belongs. Although any methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described<br>
herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present invention, the preferred methods and<br>
materials are now described.<br>
General Description<br>
[0019] Safe handling and administration of formulations comprising proteins represent<br>
significant challenges to pharmaceutical formulators. Proteins possess unique chemical and<br>
physical properties that present stability problems: a variety of degradation pathways exist for<br>
proteins, implicating both chemical and physical instability. Chemical instability includes<br>
deamination, aggregation, clipping of the peptide backbone, and oxidation of methionine<br>
residues. Physical instability encompasses many phenomena, including, for example,<br>
aggregation.<br>
[0020] Chemical and physical stability can be promoted by removing water from the protein.<br>
Lyophilization (freeze-drying under controlled conditions) is commonly used for long-term<br>
storage of proteins. The iyophilized protein is substantially resistant to degradation,<br>
aggregation, oxidation, and other degenerative processes while in the freeze-dried state. The<br>
Iyophilized protein is normally reconstituted with water optionally containing a bacteriostatic<br>
preservative (e.g., benzyl alcohol) prior to administration.<br>
Definitions<br>
[0021] By the term "therapeutically or pharmaceutically effective dose" is meant a dose that<br>
produces the desired effect for which it is administered. The exact dose will depend on the<br>
purpose of the treatment, and will be ascertamable by one skilled in the art using known<br>
techniques (see, for example, Lloyd (1999) The Art, Science and Technology of Pharmaceutical<br>
Compounding).<br>
[0022] By the term "blocker", "inhibitor", or "antagonist" is meant a substance that retards or<br>
prevents a chemical or physiological reaction or response. Common blockers or inhibitors<br>
include, but are not limited to, antisense molecules, antibodies, antagonists and their<br>
derivatives.<br>
[0023] The term "pharmaceutically acceptable" includes approval by a regulatory agency of the<br>
federal or a state government or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia or other generally recognized<br>
pharmacopeia for use in animals, and more particularly in humans.<br>
[0024] The term "carrier" includes a diluent, adjuvant, excipient, or vehicle with which a<br>
composition is administered. Carriers can include sterile liquids, such as, for example, water<br>
and oils, including oils of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, such as, for example,<br>
peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil. sesame oil and the like.<br>
[0025] The term "excipient" includes a non-therapeutic agent added to a pharmaceutical<br>
composition to provide a desired consistency or stabilizing effect. Suitable pharmaceutical<br>
excipients include, for example, starch, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk,<br>
silica gel, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, talc, sodium chloride, dried skim milk,<br>
glycerol, propylene glycol, water, ethanol and the like.<br>
[0026] The term "lyophilized" or "freeze-dried" includes a state of a substance that has been<br>
subjected to a drying procedure such as lyophilization, where at least 50% of moisture has been<br>
removed.<br>
[0027] The phrase "bulking agent" includes a compound that is pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
and that adds bulk to a lyo cake. Generally, acceptable bulking agents known to the art include,<br>
for example, carbohydrates, including simple sugars such as dextrose, ribose, fructose and the<br>
like, alcohol sugars such as mannitol, inositoi and sorbitol, disaccharides including trehalose,<br>
sucrose and lactose, naturally occurring polymers such as starch, dextrans, chitosan,<br>
hyaluronate, proteins (e.g., gelatin and serum albumin), glycogen, and synthetic monomers and<br>
polymers. In the formulations of the invention, PEG 3350 is an organic co-solvent which is used<br>
to stabilize the IL-1 protein antagonist when agitated, mixed, or handled, and as a bulking agent<br>
to help produce an acceptable bulk.<br>
[0028] The term "lyoprotectanf includes a substance that may be added to a freeze-dried or<br>
lyophilized formulation to help maintain protein structure when freeze-dried or lyophilized.<br>
[0029] A "preservative" includes a bacteriostatic, bacteriocidal, fungistatic orfungicidal<br>
compound that is generally added to formulations to retard or eliminate growth of bacteria or<br>
other contaminating microorganisms in the formulations. Preservatives include, for example,<br>
benzyl alcohol, phenol, benzalkonium chloride, m-cresol, thimerosol, chlorobutanol,<br>
methylparaben, propylparaben and the like. Other examples of pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
preservatives can be found in the USP.<br>
IL-1 Antagonists<br>
[0030] An IL-1 antagonist is a compound capable of blocking or inhibiting the biological action of<br>
IL-1, including fusion proteins capable of trapping IL-1, such as an IL-1 trap. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, the fL-1 trap is an IL-1-specific fusion protein comprising two IL-1 receptor<br>
components and a multimerizing component, for example, an !L-1 trap described in U.S. Patent<br>
Publication No. 2003/0143697, published 31 July 2003. In a specific embodiment, the IL-1 trap<br>
is the fusion protein shown in SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12,14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26. A<br>
preferred IL-1 trap is shown in SEQ ID NO:10. The invention encompasses the use of an IL-1<br>
trap substantially identical to the protein of SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, 8,10, 12,14.16,18, 20, 22, 24,<br>
26, that is, a protein having at feast 95% identity, preferably at least 97% identity, and more<br>
preferably at least 98% identity to the protein of SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12,14, 16, 18, 20, <br>
24, 26 and capable of binding and inhibiting IL-1. Further, in specific embodiments, the IL-1<br>
antagonist is a modified IL-1 trap comprising one or more receptor components and one or more<br>
immunoglobulin-derived components specific for IL-1 and/or an IL-1 receptor. In another<br>
embodiment, the IL-1 antagonist is a modified IL-1 trap comprising one or more<br>
immunoglobulin-derived components specific for IL-1 and/or an IL-1 receptor.<br>
[0031] The IL-1 trap of the methods and formulations of the invention can be prepared by any<br>
suitable method known in the art, or that comes to be known, that is useful in preparing an IL-1<br>
trap. The IL-1 trap is preferably substantially free of protein contaminants at the time it is used to<br>
prepare the pharmaceutically acceptable formulation. By "substantially free of protein<br>
contaminants" is meant, preferably, that at least 90 % of the weight of protein of an IL-1 trap<br>
preparation used for making a formulation comprising an IL-1 trap is IL-1 trap protein, more<br>
preferably at least 95%, most preferably at least 99%, The 1L^1 trap is preferably substantially<br>
free of aggregates, "Substantially free of aggregates" means that at least 90% of the weight of<br>
IL-1 trap protein is not present in an aggregate at the time the IL-1 trap is used to prepare the<br>
pharmaceutically effective formulation. The IL-1 trap of the methods and formulations of the<br>
invention may contain low or trace amounts of compounds as a results of the purification<br>
process, for example, low or trace amounts of citrate and/or polysorbate. In one embodiment of<br>
the pre-lyophilization formulation of the invention containing about 40 mg of IL-1 trap/ml, citrate<br>
may be present at a concentration of about 0.1 mM and/or polysorbate may be present at a<br>
concentration of about 0.004%. If the pre-lyophilizatlon formulation is reconstituted after<br>
lyophilization to half of the original volume (e.g., 80 mg/ml of IL-1 trap), the resulting<br>
concentrations may be 0.2 mM citrate and/or 0.008% polysorbate. If the pre-lyophilization<br>
formulation is reconstituted after lyophilization to a third of the original volume (e.g., 120 mg/ml<br>
of IL-1 trap), the resulting concentrations may be 0,6 mM citrate and/or 0.012% polysorbate,<br>
Lyophilization and Lyophiiized Formulations<br>
[0032] In one aspect of the invention, a pharmaceuticatly acceptable formulation comprising an<br>
!M trap is provided, wherein the formulation is a freeze-dried or lyophiiized formulation.<br>
Preferably, the freeze-dried or lyophiiized formulation comprises a pharmaceutically effective<br>
amount of an IL-1 trap. Lyophiiized formulations can be reconstituted into solutions,<br>
suspensions, emulsions, or any other suitable form for administration or use. Lyophiiized<br>
formulations are typically first prepared as liquids, then frozen and lyophiiized. The total liquid<br>
volume before lyophilization can be less, equal to, or more than, the final reconstituted volume<br>
of the lyophiiized formulation. The lyophilization process is well known to those of ordinary skill<br>
in the art, and typically includes sublimation of water from a frozen formulation under controlled<br>
conditions.<br>
[0033] Lyophiiized formulations can be stored at a wide range of temperatures. Lyophiiized<br>
formulations may be stored at or below 30Â°C, for example, refrigerated at 4Â°C, or at room<br>
temperature (e.g., approximately 25Â°C). Preferably, lyophiiized formulations are stored below<br>
about 25Â°C, more preferably, at about 4-20Â°C; below about 4Â°C; below about -20CC; about -<br>
40Â°C; or about -70Â°C.<br>
[0034] Lyophiiized formulations are typically reconstituted for use by addition of an aqueous<br>
solution to dissolve the lyophiiized formulation. A wide variety of aqueous solutions can be used<br>
to reconstitute a lyophiiized formulation. Preferably, lyophiiized formulations are reconstituted<br>
using water. Lyophiiized formulations are preferably reconstituted with a solution consisting<br>
essentially of water (e.g., USP WFI, or water for injection) or bacteriostatic water (e.g., USP WFI<br>
with 0.9% benzyl alcohol). However, solutions comprising buffers and/or excipients and/or one<br>
or more pharmacetically acceptable carries can also be used.<br>
[0035] Freeze-dried or lyophiiized formulations are typically prepared from liquids, that is, from<br>
solutions, suspensions, emulsions, and the like. Thus, the liquid that is to undergo freeze-drying<br>
or lyophilization preferably comprises all components desired in a final reconstituted liquid<br>
formulation. As a result, when reconstituted, the freeze-dried or lyophiiized formulation will<br>
render a desired liquid formulation upon reconstitution. A preferred liquid formulation used to<br>
generate a freeze-dried or lyophiiized formulation comprises an IL-1 trap in a pharmaceutically<br>
effective amount, a buffer, a stabilizer, and a bulking agent. Freeze-dried or lyophiiized<br>
formulations preferably comprise histidine, since histidine, in comparison to phosphate, is more<br>
effective at stabilizing the IL-1 trap when the IL-1 trap is lyophiiized. Organic cosolvents, such<br>
as PEG 3350, are used to stabilize the IL-1 trap when agitated, mixed, or handled. A<br>
lyoprotectant is preferably used in freeze-dried or lyophiiized formulations. Lyoprotectants help<br>
to maintain the secondary structure of proteins when freeze-dried or lyophilized. Three<br>
preferred example lyoprotectants are glycine, arginine, and sucrose, which are preferably used<br>
together.<br>
Stable Liquid Formulations<br>
[0036] In one aspect, the invention provides a stable pharmaceutically acceptable formulation<br>
comprising an IL-1 trap, wherein the formulation is a liquid formulation. Preferably, the liquid<br>
formulation comprises a pharmaceutically effective amount of an IL-1 trap. The formulation can<br>
also comprise one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, buffers, bulking agents,<br>
stabilizers, preservatives, and/or exctpients. An example of a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
liquid formulation comprising an IL-1 trap comprises an IL-1 trap in a pharmaceutically effective<br>
amount, a buffer, a co-solvent, and one or more stabilizers.<br>
[0037] A preferred liquid formulation comprises phosphate buffer, an organic co-solvent, and<br>
one or more thermal stabilizers to minimize formation of aggregates and low molecular weight<br>
products when stored, and about 12.5 mg/ml to about 50 mg/ml IL-1 trap, wherein the<br>
formulation is from about pH 6.0 to about pH 6.75. A more preferred liquid formulation<br>
comprises 10 mM phosphate buffer, 3% PEG, 50 mM NaCI, 5-20% sucrose, and 10-100 mg/ml<br>
IL-1 trap, wherein the formulation is at a pH of about 6,0 to about 6.5. Although either NaCI or<br>
sucrose can be used as a stabilizer, a combination of NaCI and sucrose has been established to<br>
stabilize the IL-1 trap more effectively than either individual stabilizer alone. Preferably, PEG is<br>
PEG 3350, which has been established to enhance IL-1 trap stability,<br>
[0038] Table 1 shows the percent of native IL-1 trap or percent aggregated IL-1 trap in samples<br>
containing either 5 or 20% sucrose as determined over a period of up to 24 months when<br>
incubated at 5Â°C. In the presence of 20% sucrose, the native (non-aggregated) form of IL-1 trap<br>
dropped from 92.6% at day 0 to 88.9% at 24 months and the percentage aggregate increased<br>
from 2.3% to 3.4% over the same time period. The 5% sucrose formulation had a native (nonaggregated)<br>
form of IL-1 trap dropped from 92.4% at day 0 to 86.9% at 24 months and the<br>
percentage aggregate increased from 2.6% to 3.6% over the same time period.<br>
 [0040] Formulations, whether liquid or freeze-dried and lyophilized, can be stored in an oxygendeprived<br>
environment. Oxygen-deprived environments can be generated by storing the<br>
formulations under an inert gas such as, for example, argon, nitrogen, or helium.<br>
[0041] The stability of pre-lyophilized and lyophilized formulations was determined. A prelyophilized<br>
formulation containing 40 mg/ml IL-1 trap (SEQ ID NO:10), 20 mM histidine, 1.5%<br>
PEG-3350,1% sucrose, 0.5% glycine, 25 mM arginine-HCI, pH 6.5 was incubated at 5Â°C for <br>
52 weeks. As shown in Table 3, the native (non-aggregated) form of IL-1 decreased from <br>
(0 weeks) to 92.3 (52 weeks), and the percent aggregate increased from 1% to 1.8% in the<br>
same time period.(Table Removed)<br><br><br><br><br>
