				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to elastic stockings and is directed more particularly to a process of manufacture of a custom-made elastic stocking for compressing the limb for therapeutic purposes.<br>
Elastic stockings are necessary for controlling swelling of the limb due to venous edema and lymph edema. Veins have valves. When the valves become either incompetent or get damaged. the venous return of blood from the limb becomes inadequate and. thus, swelling of limb occurs. This is called venous edema. Lymphatic are a system of tubes carrying a protein rich fluid called lymph. Blockage of lymphatic due to various reasons causes accumulation of protein rich fluid in the limb causing swelling. This swelling is called lymph edema. Where as in venous edema the swelling of the limb is somewhat regular, in lymph edema it is irregular. Minces. whereas a stocking of regular shape is somewhat adulate for controlling venous edema, it is not suitable for lymphoedama.<br>
Ideally, an elastic stocking should exert uniform pressure all over the applied area. A stocking of regular shape is not suitable when the swelling is irregular, as in lymphoedama. It is likely to exert non-uniform pressure over the applied area, which may aggravate the swelling. For example, if the pressure is more on the leg than on the foot the swelling of the foot will go up. A custom made elastic stocking, which exerts uniform pressure all over the applied area is free from this disadvantage. It is effective in preventing recurrence of swelling. For making a custom-made elastic stocking measurement of circumference of the limb at number of points is taken. The proportionate circumference of the elastic stocking over the corresponding points is calculated taking the elasticity factor into view. This helps the garment exert uniform pressure over the whole-applied area.<br><br>
The elastic slocking available in the market arc knitted from elastic fabrics. They are knitted in expensive machines. As such they are costly, costing between Rs.700 to Rs. 1300/-. for a below knee stocking. A stocking can last only for 3-4 months and a pair is necessary for alternately using and washing. Thus, the patient has to spend about Rs.1500/- every 3-4 months throughout his life. Because, most of the people are poor in our country they cannot afford it and hence most of them do not use it. More so, they are manufactured in big cities and getting them lakes several weeks.<br>
Statement of the invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a process of manufacturing a custom-made elastic stocking to fit to a patient"s limb while compressing it; the said stocking made from elastic garment tubes wherein a portion (S|) of the tube is removed from the front of the ankle to account for the discrepancy in the length between the back and the front of the limb; and portions S2, S3 and S4 of the said tube removed from the dorsum of the foot, from the front of the leg and from the back of the leg respectively to make the tube conform to the foot and leg while exerting uniform pressure over the applied area.<br>
The present stocking is made from low stretch elastic garment tubes used as knee cap and anklet etc for sportsmen. The tube has uniform diameter all over. The material is inexpensive and can be procured for less than seventy rupees per meter. The material of the tube is rubber thread sandwiched between cotton threads, and is porous for allowing ventilation of and escape of sweat from the limb.<br><br>
The calculation of measurements of this stocking is simple. It can be stitched by any tailor with the ordinary sewing machine. It can be manufactured even in a village and be delivered within few hours. The average length of an elastic tube needed for fabricating a stocking is about 70 cm which costs about fifty rupees. Along with cutting and stitching charges it is possible to provide a stocking in about one hundred rupees, which is affordable. In fact, many poor patients are using this stocking at the present.<br>
Process of manufacture:<br>
As the first step, the coefficient of expansion of the elastic tube related to pressure is easily determined by keeping a blood pressure measurement cuff inside the tube and then inflating it while measuring the diameter of the stretched elastic tube. For example if is a pressure of 55 mm Hg expands the diameter of the tube by 25%, then the co-efficient of expansion at 55 mm Hg pressure is 0.25. Hence, if a pressure of 55 mm Hg is required at a point over the limb, the diameter of the elastic stocking at that point should be the diameter of the limb at that point divided by 1.25.<br>
in the next step the measurement of the circumference of the foot and leg at different points are taken. The pressure desired for compressing the limb is noted. The required circumference of the stocking at the corresponding points for the purpose of exerting the desired amount of pressure is calculated by the method already described. This helps in (he shocking exert uniform pressure over the whole applied area.<br>
The length of the limb is measured from the base of the big toe to the knee joint on the front across the ankle and also behind across the heel and sole<br><br>
of foot. The length is shorter in front and longer on the back of the limb, because the heel projects backwards at the ankle Joint. The difference between the two measurements is calculated.<br>
A tube piece equal to the combined length  of the leg and foot on the back is taken and placed flat on a table. A triangular piece corresponding to the difference in length between back and front of the limb is removed from the front of the ankle.<br>
When a limb is thin, a vertical portion of the tube is removed to make it conform to the limb. Conversely, if a limb is thick extra vertical portion of the tube has to be attached to make it conform to the limb. In a limb, which is thin at places and thick at places, a portion is removed from over the thin area while simultaneously attaching extra portions over the thick area.<br>
Wherever two margins are to be stitched together, one centimeter extra garment is saved for stitching the margins. All the borders are given overlapping stitches to prevent the thread from coming out. All longitudinal stitches are put without stretching the tube. I he transverse stitch at the ankle is put while keeping the tube transversely at stretch. This will prevent constriction of the ankle by the non-expansive cotton sewing threads.<br>
This invention will be described with reference to the figures in the drawing in sheets 1 and 2.<br>
Fig. I : This is the view of a leg (knee to toe). BF3| is the ankle. A1B1and AB are the lengths of the dorsum (upper surface) and the sole of the fool respectively. B1C1 and BC are the length of the front and back of the leg<br><br>
respectively. A1B1C1and AF5C are the length of the limb (combined length of the leg and foot) on the front and on the back respectively. The circumferences of foot and leg at different levels are a, b, c, d, e, f and g.<br>
Fig.2 : It is the elastic tube lying flat on which the marking for the design of the stocking is made. The length of the elastic tube taken is AC which is equal to (AB+BC), which is the combined length of the leg and foot on the back. Also the line AC is the backside of the stocking. The segments A1B1 and C1B1 in fig. I is marked on the tube on the front. B1B1 is difference between the length of the back and the front of the limb. The triangle BB|B| is excised saving one centimeter extra at the margin. The apex of the triangle is 2 cm away from the point B. This is done to prevent presence of stitches underneath the heel which can cause discomfort. The shaded area, S1 is the portion of the tube to be removed over the ankle. This is done for adjusting the difference between the length of the front and back of the limb.<br>
a1, b1, C1. d1, e1, f1  and g1 are the circumferences of the elastic stocking at points corresponding to a. b. c. d. e. f and g in fig. 1. They are calculated taking the coefficient of expansion factor of the lube, with a view to imparting uniform compression. The extra portions of the elastic tube are cut off and removed. It is done in such a way that over the foot the portion (S1) is removed from the dorsum, so that the stitches lie on the dorsum of the foot and not on the sole. The shaded areas S3 is removed from the front and S1 from the back of the leg. Always one centimeter extra is saved at each margin beyond the line of stitching.<br>
Fig.3 : It shows the tube alter necessary portions are removed. Transverse stitching of M toM border (on one side of the ankle) and N to N borders (on the other side of the ankle) are done while keeping the tube<br><br>
transversely at stretch, to prevent restriction of the tube to stretch while attempting to wear. Rest of the stitches are put longitudinally, without stretching them, to join the margins. Always one centimeter margin is kept beyond the stitches, to prevent threads at the margin from coming out.<br>
Fig.4 : It is the stocking after final stitching is over. (T) is the transverse stitch over the ankle. (O) is the overlapping stitch over all borders. (L) are the longitudinal stitches.<br>
Fig.5   It is the appearance of stocking when it is worn by the patient. The stocking does not cover the toes to avoid their crowding and maceration.<br>
Method of using the device<br>
This stocking is worn like any other socking. The lower end extends upto the base of the toes. The transverse stitch is exactly over the ankle. the upper end of the stocking extends upto the knee joint. If necessary a patch from a spare piece of tube can be added. The stocking exerts uniform pressure over the whole area it is worm. The excess margins beyond the stitch always lie on the outside of the stocking unlike other garments, where the margins lie on the inside. This is done to prevent localized pressure by the margins, which can cause ulceration.<br>
The advantages of the present art of manufacture are :<br>
I.	It is easy to fabricate, since it needs only stitching from elastic garment<br>
tubes and not knitting from threads.<br><br>
2.	It is inexpensive, since the basic material viz., the elastic garment tube is cheap. In fact it is several times cheaper than the commercially fabricated custom-made elastic stockings.<br>
3.	It can be provided in the doctor"s clinic itself avoiding the delay in getting one from the manufacturer.<br>
It is understood that  the present invention is by no means limited to the particular design herein disclosed and or shown in the drawing but also comprises any modification or equivalent within the scope of disclosure.<br><br><br>
