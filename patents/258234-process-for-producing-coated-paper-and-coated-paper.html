DESCRIPTION<br>
PROCESS FOR PRODUCING A COATED PAPER AND COATED PAPER<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a process and<br>
apparatus for producing a coated paper.<br>
In particular, the present invention involves using,<br>
as means for forming coating layers on a surface of a base<br>
paper, coating apparatuses differing in coating method, for<br>
example, coating apparatuses including a combination of a<br>
roll coater and a blade coater that form, at least two<br>
coating layers on a surface layer of the base paper. The<br>
present invention suitably relates to a process for<br>
producing a coated paper that can efficiently carry out<br>
production with high quality at a speed of 1300 m/min or<br>
more, particularly at a high speed of 1550 m/min or more<br>
integratedly from paper to finally finished products by<br>
means of on-machine technology, and coated paper.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002]<br>
In response to recent promotion of visualization and<br>
changes to multimedia, needs have been rapidly increased to<br>
highly qualify such as to visualize and colorize even<br>
printed matters having been widely used as media such as<br>
publications, advertisements, and posters. With changes in<br>
such user demands, an increase in the replacement of a<br>
conventional uncoated printing paper by a coated paper for<br>
printing rapidly leads to increasing demand for the coated<br>
paper for printing.<br>
[0003]<br>
In addition, printing steps more and more severely<br>
request the qualities of handling properties of printing<br>
paper and traveling stability on a printer, which are<br><br>
-2-<br>
involved in improvement in workability and efficiency.<br>
[0004]<br>
Of the quality requests, paper manufacturing<br>
industries have implemented involvements with wider and<br>
more highly speedy paper machines in order to save energy<br>
and reduce manufacturing costs.<br>
[0005]<br>
In the quality request for a coated paper and power<br>
saving and manufacturing cost reduction, the trend lies in<br>
lower grams per square meter of a base paper and ultra<br>
lightweight coating. In manufacturing premises,<br>
reformation is strongly invoked for techniques of producing<br>
a coated paper for printing having more excellent printing<br>
properties while maintaining characteristics of high-speed<br>
running ability.<br>
[0006]<br>
In response to these quality demands, a technique is<br>
disclosed that involves, in an offset printing paper to be<br>
coated including an undercoat coated layer having a pigment<br>
and an adhesive and an overcoat coated layer, containing in<br>
a base paper 3 to 20 weight % of a needle or columnar soft<br>
calcium carbonate as an internal loading material based on<br>
the weight of the base paper, containing in the undercoat<br>
coated layer a styrene/butadiene copolymer latex having a<br>
gel content of from 75 to 90 weight % and having an average<br>
particle diameter of from 40 to 70 mm, and containing in<br>
the overcoat coated layer a styrene/butadiene copolymer<br>
latex having a gel content of from 40 to 70 weight %' and<br>
having an average particle diameter of from 40 to 80 mm<br>
(Patent Document 1). Also disclosed is a process of<br>
producing a to-be-coated paper for applying a coating<br>
liquid having a pigment and an adhesive to a paper base, in<br>
which a wet paper is water-squeezed using a shoe press in a<br>
press part of a base paper machine; the dried base paper<br>
and/or undercoat coated paper produced by applying a<br>
coating liquid to the base paper is treated by means of a<br><br>
-3-<br>
soft calender constituted by a metal roll and an elastic<br>
roll at a metal roll surface temperature of from 40 to 90Â°C<br>
at a linear pressure of from 30 to 150 kg/cm, and then a<br>
coating liquid having a pigment and an adhesive is applied<br>
thereto (Patent Document 2).<br>
[0007]<br>
However, the re-examination of the formulation of a<br>
coated layer, improvement by means of a press part, or the<br>
like is a simple extension of prior art. Even if the<br>
technique improves print visual quality, operability and<br>
productivity in production premises are not improved, and<br>
thus, such a technique is not a basic solution.<br>

No. 11-001891<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Problems to be Solved by the Invention<br>
[0008]<br>
Therefore, a primary problem of the present invention<br>
is to increase productivity and also produce a coated<br>
paper with quality required for a coated paper, while a<br>
basis weight of a product is decreased to less than 64 g/m2<br>
and ultra lightweight coating is performed attributable to<br>
reduction in recent paper cost.<br>
[0009]<br>
Another problem is to obtain a coated paper of good<br>
print visual quality having a glossiness of 55% or more,<br>
more desirably 60% or more. Still another problem is to<br>
be capable of producing a coated paper with high<br>
productivity while coping with environmental problems even<br>
if a waste paper has a high blend degree of 10% or more.<br>
Further problems will be clarified by descriptions, below.<br>
Means for Solving the Problems<br><br>
-4-<br>
[0010]<br>
The present invention having solved the above<br>
problems is as described below.<br><invention according to claim><br>
A process for producing a coated paper in which<br>
continuous steps are incorporated successively within on-<br>
machine, the process comprising:<br>
a step of making a paper with a twin wire former in<br>
which a paper material is injected from a head box between<br>
two wires each of which loops to form a paper layer;<br>
an undercoating step of applying an undercoating<br>
liquid to a dry web by a size press;<br>
a step of drying the undercoating liquid<br>

after performing the step (1) ,<br>
(1)	a roll coater coating step of roll-coating one<br>
side and the other side of a paper to be coated with an<br>
aqueous coating liquid consisting mainly of an adhesive<br>
and a pigment, and then drying the coated paper,<br>
(2)	a blade coater coating step of blade-coating one<br>

a step of subjecting the coated paper to a flattening<br>
treatment using a heat soft calender comprising a<br>
combination of a metal roll and an elastic roll- formed in<br>
a multi-stage having at least two nips.<br>
[0011]<br><invention according to claim><br>
The process for producing a coated paper according to<br>
claim 1, wherein the pre-calender comprises a heated metal<br>
roll as at least one roll of a pair of rolls.<br><br>
-5-<br>
[0012]<br><invention according to claim><br>
The process for producing a coated paper according to<br>
claim 1 or 2, wherein the pre-calender comprises a pair of<br>
a metal roll and an elastic roll and the metal roll is<br>
heated to a temperature of 100 to 300'"C.<br>
[0013]<br><invention according to claim><br>
The process for producing a coated paper according to<br>
any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein the flattening treatment<br>
is performed by the pre-calender comprising the metal roll<br>
heated to a temperature of 230Â°C or more.<br>
[0014]<br><invention according to claim><br>
A coated paper produced by the process for producing<br>
according to any one of claims 1 to 4.<br>
[0015]<br>
[00151<br>
The coating apparatuses include a size press, a<br>
calender sizing, a wire bar, an air knife coater, a roll<br>
coater (gate roll coater or the like: a coating system of<br>
transferring a coating liquid using a roll), a blade<br>
coater (bill blade coater or the like: a method of removing<br>
a coating liquid with a blade to form a coated layer) and a<br>
spray. In Europe many apparatuses are run using a roll<br>
coater due to production efficiency priority, and in Japan<br>
blade coaters are run due to quality priority.<br>
[0016]<br>
However, there are no precedents for a process for<br>
producing a coated paper constituted by a combination of<br>
different coating apparatuses and for a coated paper, which<br>
are proposed by the present invention. Further, there is<br>
no example of finally flattening a surface of a coated<br>
layer by means of a flattening apparatus including a metal<br>
roll and an elastic roll.<br>
[0017]<br><br>
-6-<br>
A coated paper is actively produced using a similar<br>
kind of roll coater or blade coater. However, a<br>
combination of different coating apparatuses, for example,<br>
a combination of a roll coater and a blade coater, makes<br>
its apparatus structure complicated and requires diverse<br>
knowledge also from the viewpoint of maintenance, and thus<br>
has not been adopted.<br>
[0018]<br>
In a coated paper manufacturing facility including a<br>
combination of blade coaters of the same type, the facility<br>
flow becomes very long and needs wide placement space. In<br>
the production of a coated paper having low grams per<br>
square meter and a high blend of waste paper also, the<br>
problem of frequent paper breakage affected by a blade<br>
touch pressure occurs due to a problem of a decrease in<br>
paper strength, at a high speed paper making, for example,<br>
a speed exceeding 1300 m/min. Although there are some<br>
measures of restraining a paper making speed and a blade<br>
touch pressure, the production efficiency is worsened and<br>
the adjustment of a coating amount become difficult.<br>
[0019]<br>
Although needing few placement space, a combination<br>
of roll coaters of the same type makes the smoothness of a<br>
coated face inferior to that by a blade coater because of<br>
coating by transfer from a roll, thereby being incapable of<br>
satisfying a demand of high glossiness and high printing<br>
suitability.<br>
[0020]<br>
A brief comparison between roll coating and blade<br>
coating makes clear their superiority and inferiority from<br>
a correlation between the coating amounts per face. In<br>
other words, at 8 g/m2 or more, blade coating is superior<br>
in coating properties and smoothness, while roll coating'<br>
readily makes the surface lips and dips depending on the<br>
lips and dips of a base paper and thus is inferior. On the<br>
other hand, at 6 g/nr or less, blade coating tends to<br><br>
-7-<br>
render the lip portion of the base paper to be exposed only<br>
when a coating liquid is placed within the dip portion and<br>
thus is inferior, while roll coating is superior in coating<br>
properties. In addition, basically regardless of the<br>
amount of coating, the case of blade coating is high in the<br>
ratio of paper breakage (the higher the speed or the larger<br>
the amount of a waste paper blended, the more apparent the<br>
trend), while the case of roll coating is low in the ratio<br>
of paper breakage. Even at a small amount of coating of 6<br>
g/m2 or less, the use of clay with a high aspect ratio, for<br>
example, delaminated clay (thin planar crystal structure<br>
clay), which obtains high coating properties and gross as a<br>
pigment, increases the viscosity during high speed coating.<br>
For this reason, roll coating is more suitable. In roll<br>
coating, when the amount of coating becomes 8 g/m2' or more,<br>
the profile in the width direction is difficult to control<br>
and also a so-called orange peel pattern is generated, so<br>
that face feel and the adhesion of ink become inferior. On<br>
the other hand, blade coating generally does not pose such<br>
problems. Blade coating enables high concentration coating<br>
of, for example, a coating concentration of 65% or more,<br>
while roll coating requires the coating concentration to be<br>
56% or less. Thus, drying energy cost per kilogram of<br>
paper is lower in blade coating.<br>
As such, roll coater coating and blade coater coating<br>
indicated different trends.<br>
[0021]<br>
For manufacturing a coated paper, including foreign<br>
countries and Japan, an off-machine coater in which a paper<br>
making machine and a coating machine are separated from<br>
each other and an on-machine coater in which a coating<br>
machine is incorporated into a paper making machine are<br>
known. For an off-machine coater, a paper is generally<br>
passed through a size press at a paper making stage.<br>
Passing a paper through a pre-calender is not implemented<br>
so long as the inventor knows. In the case of an on-<br><br>
-8-<br>
machine coater, passing a paper through a size press is<br>
conducted in few cases. instead, passing a paper through a<br>
pre-calender device is carried out (an apparatus including<br>
the both does not seem to exist).<br>
[0022]<br>
In particular, in a coating apparatus using an off-<br>
machine, a coating base paper of a low basis weight poses a<br>
large problem of paper breakage during splicing by auto-<br>
splicer.<br>
[0023]<br>
An auto-splicer is an apparatus that carries out<br>
paper splicing without stopping a coater for the purpose of<br>
production efficiency improvement. Since the paper<br>
splicing section forms a lip portion constituted by<br>
adhesion means such as an adhesion tape disposed between<br>
pieces of base paper, paper breakage is unlikely generated<br>
at a coating speed of 1000 m/min or less. However, at a<br>
speed exceeding 1000 m/min, particularly a speed exceeding<br>
1300 m/min, a fine deviation of a winding rotational tuning<br>
speed as well as paper breakage by contact of a paper<br>
splicing section with a doctor blade edge are readily<br>
generated.<br>
[0024]<br>
For the improvement of paper breakage, measures of<br>
improving the tensile strength of the base paper itself are<br>
adopted. According to the knowledge of the inventor,<br>
however, at least the tensile strength (MD) needs 3.0 kN/m<br>
or more. In a waste paper of low grams per square meter<br>
obtained by highly blending a waste paper having a low<br>
tensile strength, measures such as internal addition of a<br>
large amount of a paper strength additive are required, and<br>
therefore a large increase in cost is unavoidable.<br>
[0025]<br>
In' coating by an on-machine, an auto splicer is<br>
unnecessary and the strength of the base paper itself can<br>
be also set low. In the present situations, however, the<br><br>
-9-<br>
running speed (not a design speed) is at most about 1200<br>
m/min.<br>
[0026]<br>
Trying to obtain a higher paper making speed (running<br>
speed) exceeding 1300 m/min requires a tensile strength<br>
(MD) of 2.6 kN/m or more. In coating by an on-machine,<br>
particularly for a high blend of waste paper, as in an off-<br>
machine, measures such as internal addition of a paper<br>
strength additive are needed, and therefore an increase in<br>
cost is unavoidable.<br>
[0027]<br>
Different from a waste paper consisting essentially<br>
of a virgin pulp, a recent waste paper in which a waste<br>
paper pulp is largely blended exhibits a remarkable tensile<br>
strength decrease and prominent foreign matter<br>
(contaminants) mixing. In the case where coating is<br>
carried out in a basis weight of paper of about 30 to<br>
about 45 g/m: at a speed of 1000 m/min, particularly at a<br>
speed exceeding 1300 m/min, the problem of paper breakage<br>
is always created.<br>
[0028]<br>
Paper breakage in a blade coater is liable to occur<br>
by pushing pressure by a blade. In particular, since paper<br>
breakage by an on-machine stops a series of apparatuses<br>
from a paper making machine to a coating apparatus,<br>
decreases in production loss and production efficiency are<br>
extremely large. Thus, in the present situations, the<br>
production of a coated paper of low grams per square meter<br>
is generally implemented by coating by an off-machine.<br>
[0029]<br>
The present inventors have found out a technique<br>
capable of providing a coated paper having good print<br>
visual quality with low grams per square meter and high<br>
blending of waste paper by use of a high speed paper<br>
machine, which is an object of the present invention. The<br>
coated paper is provided firstly by forming at least two<br><br>
-10-<br>
coated layers on a surf-ace of a base paper by use of a<br>
coating apparatus comprising a combination of different<br>
coating apparatuses, preferably a combination of a roil<br>
coater and a blade coater as means for forming coated<br>
layers on a surface of a base paper, and secondly by<br>
flattening the surface of the coated layer by a combination<br>
of a metal roll and an elastic roll. This has lead to the<br>
completion of the present invention.<br>
[0030]<br>
The present invention can continuously perform a<br>
coating' step passing through a step of making paper and<br>
applying an undercoating liquid of starch or the like onto<br>
a dry paper web by size press and through a step of<br>
performing a flattening treatment on the resulting web by a<br>
pre-calender device.<br>
[0031]<br>
The coating step is a coating step of selecting a<br>
single coating step of (1) or (2) as follows, or a coating<br>
step of performing the step (2) after performing the step<br>
(1) <br>
(1)	A roll coater coating step of roll-coating one<br>
side and the other side of a paper to be coated with an<br>
aqueous coating liquid consisting mainly of an adhesive and<br>
a pigment, and then drying the coated paper.<br>
(2)	A blade coater coating step of blade-coating one<br>
side and the other side of a paper to be coated with an<br>
aqueous coating liquid consisting mainly of an adhesive and<br>
a pigment, and then drying the coated paper.<br>
[0032]<br>
Thereafter, the paper to be coated is subjected to a<br>
flattening treatment using a heat soft calender comprising<br>
a combination of a metal roll and an elastic roll formed in<br>
a multi-stage having at least two nips.<br>
[0033]<br>
The selection of the coating step can be carried out,<br>
in one line, according to, for example, base paper grams<br><br>
-11-<br>
per square meter, the presence or absence of waste paper,<br>
the amount of waste paper blended, the amount of coating,<br>
the line speed, product grams per square meter, glossiness<br>
to be required, and qualities of smoothness and the like.<br>
This makes it possible to commonly produce an ultra<br>
lightweight coated paper, a fine coated paper, an A3 coated<br>
paper, and an A2 coated paper as required. Although these<br>
classifications are not clear for those skilled in the art,<br>
for example, a blade coater can be used for an A3 coated<br>
paper of 64.0 g/m? or 60.2 g/m2 or more, a blade coater or<br>
a roll coater for a fine coated paper of 58.0 g/m-' or 54.2<br>
g/rrr, and a roll coater for a lightweight coated paper of<br>
51.2 g/rrr or less.<br>
[0034]<br>
A first feature of the present invention is to<br>
 incorporate into an on-machine coater a step of coating an<br>
undercoating liquid of starch or the like using a size<br>
press and a step of performing a flattening treatment by a<br>
pre-calender.<br>
[0035]<br>
Implementation of undercoating of starch by a size<br>
press enables the rigidity and paper strength by the starch<br>
to be increased and enables the prevention of paper<br>
breakage also by lower grams per square meter of a base<br>
paper or high blending of a waste paper (in particular, in<br>
the case of blade coating) as well as restrains the<br>
protrusion of contaminants and contributes to flattening of<br>
a subsequent coating liquid.<br>
[0036]<br>
Subsequently, a flattening treatment is desirably<br>
performed by a pre-calender. A pre-calender contributes to<br>
the flattening and also, in particular, to homogenization<br>
of the profile in the width direction after the subsequent<br>
coating step. That is, the flattening treatment serves to<br>
homogenize the surface of a paper onto which an<br>
undercoating liquid of starch or the like has been applied.<br><br>
-12-<br>
In particular, where a target paper width is 7000 mm or<br>
more, the profile in the width direction after coating is<br>
greatly broken, while the implementation of the flattening<br>
treatment by a pre-calender can homogenize the surface. In<br>
particular, subsequently, in the case where coating of 8<br>
g/m: or more is carried out by a roll coater, profile<br>
control in the width direction is difficult by a roll<br>
coater, while the adoption of a pre-calender enables the<br>
homogenization of the profile in the width direction. In<br>
addition, in the case where blade coating is performed for<br>
the homogenization of the surface in the width direction, a<br>
pre-calender uniforms tne touch of a blade and thereby also<br>
contributes to the prevention of paper breakage.<br>
[0037]<br>
A second feature is that the invention is that the<br>
selective coating step or apparatus described above is<br>
provided. The advantage of this respect has been described<br>
previously and thus is not'described again.<br>
[0038]<br>
A third feature is inclusion of a step or apparatus<br>
for performing a flattening treatment using a heat soft<br>
calender comprising a combination of a metal roll and an<br>
elastic roll formed in a multi-stage having at least two<br>
nips. In particular, 6-stage, more preferably 8-stage (7-<br>
nip) or 10-stage multi-nip calender is most appropriate.<br>
[0039]<br>
With a lower coating amount, flattening properties<br>
and glossiness become difficult to secure. On the other-<br>
hand, the inclusion of a step of flattening treatment of<br>
the present invention enables a coated paper having a<br>
target glossiness of 55% or more, particularly 60% or more<br>
to be obtained, for example, even in the case where the<br>
coating amount is 7 g/m2 or less, particularly 6 g/m2 or<br>
less, the product grams-per square meter is less than 54.2<br>
g/m2 and the base paper grams-per square meter is 4 5.0 g/m2<br>
or less.<br><br>
-13-<br>
[0040]<br>
Although disposing a (heat soft calender) multi-nip<br>
calender itself is well-known, adoption examples are not so<br>
many. Needless to say, a combination of undercoating for<br>
coating by a size press and a pre-calender is just a<br>
beginning for any of off-machines and on-machines. These<br>
combinations according to the present invention enable even<br>
the production of ultra lightweight coated paper of 51.2<br>
g/m or less from the viewpoint of the provision of high<br>
smoothness and high glossiness.<br>
[0041]<br>
After the implementation of coating by a roll coater,<br>
it is possible to carry out coating by a blade coater. As<br>
described previously, in the case by a roll coater, coating<br>
properties of paints are good even in a low coating amount.<br>
Then, first, when coating is carried out by a blade coater<br>
after implementation of coating by a roll coater, a second<br>
coating layer is coated by a blade coater excellent in<br>
smoothness on a first coating layer exhibiting good coating<br>
properties. For this reason, even if a low coating amount<br>
(ultra lightweight coat) of 6 g/m2 or less as the total<br>
coating amount or a coating amount of about 7 to 9 g/m2 per<br>
face is used, a coated paper can be obtained that is<br>
excellent in coating properties, smoothness and glossiness.<br>
[0042]<br>
Moreover, the first coating layer is allowable if the<br>
coating properties can be secured, so that a high quality<br>
coating liquid is not required to be used. Hence, an<br>
advantage is that a coating liquid at a low cost is coated<br>
by a blade coater to be capable of forming a high quality<br>
coating layer.<br>
[0043]<br>
Furthermore, disposing a size press enables<br>
undercoating of starch or the like, and also enables the<br>
use of a pigment and an adhesive for coating.<br>
[0044]<br><br>
-14-<br>
The present invention enables the production of an<br>
ultra lightweight coat paper of low grams per square meter<br>
at a paper making speed of 1300 m/min or more or exceeding<br>
it, particularly at a running speed of 1550 m/min or more,<br>
at from 1600 m/min to 1800 m/min. When the running speed<br>
becomes 1300 m/min or more, the mode of technical problems<br>
for quality to be demanded is completely changed compared<br>
with the case of a running speed of 1300 m/min or less, a<br>
running speed of 1200 m/min that is presently regarded as a<br>
high speed. Needless to say, for an on-machine coater,<br>
problems that are difficult to solve are extremely many.<br>
[0045]<br>
With a base paper of the present invention, a paper<br>
material is ejected from a head box into between two wires<br>
that each make loops to form a paper layer. For example,<br>
the base paper is subjected to a size press, after passing<br>
through a step of making a paper using a twin wire former<br>
of a cap type and a step of forming a wet paper by<br>
dewatering means using a suction (forming) roll and/or a<br>
blade in a wire part. The base paper that is made using a<br>
twin wire former of a cap type preferably has sufficient<br>
paper strength even in low grams per square meter.<br>
[0046]<br>
Application of starch by a size press can further<br>
improve paper strength.<br>
[0047]<br>
Furthermore, the improvement of flattening properties<br>
of the base paper surface (particularly, in the width<br>
direction) by a pre-calender makes it possible to have<br>
sufficient paper strength and flattening properties even if<br>
a touch pressure of a blade is high, but not leading to<br>
paper breakage, in a coating apparatus. After coating,<br>
flattening treatment at a high speed and a high temperature'<br>
by means of a multi-stage multi-nip calender comprising an<br>
elastic roll and a metal roll can obtain flattening<br>
properties and high glossiness of the surface of the<br><br>
-15-<br>
coating layer.<br>
[0048]<br>
The present inventor has found that disposing a size<br>
press and further a pre-calender in a pre-step of a roll<br>
coater is extremely effective means for solving print<br>
visual quality failure and damage generation and improving<br>
printing and glossiness unevenness due to coating profile<br>
unevenness that is a specific problem of a roll coater in<br>
low grams-per square meter, in order to cope with<br>
technically demanded, low grams-per square meter and high<br>
blending of a waste paper that is friendly to the<br>
environment and to obtain high quality good look printing<br>
suitability and glossiness.<br>
[0049]<br>
Additionally, in a coating liquid by size press, a<br>
surface sizing agent, an antifoaming agent, an antiseptic,<br>
a thickener, etc., which are usually as required used, are<br>
used together as appropriate.<br>
[0050]<br>
Moreover, it is necessary to perform a flattening<br>
treatment to a paper at high temperature without paper<br>
break in order to obtain evenness and glossiness of the<br>
surface of a coated paper while maintaining rigidity<br>
required in printing suitability, i.e., stiffness of paper.<br>
A conventionally generally adopted fattening treatment<br>
using a plurality of stacks not only needs placement space,<br>
but is difficult to make an apparatus high temperature and<br>
is extremely bad in flattening efficiency to a base paper.<br>
For this reason, it is impossible to increase a paper<br>
making speed in order to obtain evenness and glossiness<br>
with maintenance of rigidity while substantially avoiding<br>
paper breakage, thereby having to perform the production at<br>
a sheet making speed of 1200 m/min or less.<br>
[0051]<br>
A more preferred aspect of the present invention<br>
includes a flattening apparatus comprising a combination of<br><br>
-16-<br>
a metal roll and an elastic roll in the present invention,<br>
for example, a combination with a multi-nip calender. As a<br>
still more preferred aspect of a multi-nip calender, a<br>
jacket roll is applied to a metal roll of a multi-nip<br>
calender. A multi-nip calender includes a combination of a<br>
metal roll and an elastic roll in a multi-stage. Each nip<br>
pressure per roll is individually increased to about 450<br>
kN/m. Making the number of rolls 6 to 12 stages<br>
sufficiently enables a flattening treatment even to a paper<br>
making speed of 1300 m/min or more and further even a high<br>
speed coating of 1600 m/min or more.<br>
[0052]<br>
In some cases, each interval between rolls is opened<br>
with one to two nips closed, and a coated paper of a mat<br>
pattern can be also produced. However, a flattening<br>
treatment with a roll number of 6 to 12 stages can obtain a<br>
coated paper of a white paper glossiness of 55% or more,<br>
particularly 60% or more, even at a high speed paper making<br>
speed of 1300 m/min.<br>
Advantages of the Invention<br>
[0053]<br>
According to the present invention, a brilliant high-<br>
quality coated paper can be produced at a high production<br>
efficiency even for a base paper with low grams per square<br>
meter and high blending of a waste paper. The advantage of<br>
the present invention is clarified by examples and<br>
comparative examples that have been diligently studied for<br>
a long period of time and are described below.<br>
[0054]<br>
A high quality coated paper excellent in glossiness,<br>
smoothness, printing suitability, etc., can be produced,<br>
with extremely good operationability being secured, in high<br>
speed paper making at a paper making speed of exceeding<br>
1300 m/min by means of a process for producing a coated<br>
paper according to the present invention using paper making<br><br>
-17-<br>
equipment (online machine) integratedly from a paper raw<br>
material to a product.<br>
[0055]<br>
The present invention is intended to produce, for<br>
example, a coated paper or ultra lightweight coated paper<br>
having 10% or more of a waste paper blended in its raw<br>
material as a raw material pulp, with paper grams per<br>
square meter of from 28 to 80 g/m2 (particularly from 35 to<br>
48 g/m-) , product grams per square meter of from 30 to 103<br>
g/m* (particularly from 35 to 64 g/nr) and a one-side<br>
coating amount of from 2 to 23 g/m' (particularly from 4 to<br>
9 g/m2) continuously and integratedly from paper making to<br>
winding at a paper making speed of 1300 m/min or more, for<br>
example, at a high speed of an average paper making speed<br>
of from 1600 m/min to 1800 m/min. In addition, desirably,<br>
the coating amount is from 2 to 10 g/m2 (particularly from<br>
5 to 7 g/m2) at one side in roll coating, and from 6 to 15<br>
g/m" (particularly from 7 to 9 g/m;) at one side in blade<br>
coating. Usually, both-face coating is desirably carried<br>
out, and thus the amount is twice the above one-side<br>
coating amount.<br>
[0056]<br>
The present invention can make the number of<br>
operators smaller. In re-reeler equipment of re-reeling<br>
and off-calender requiring running termination and paper<br>
joining, a total of 16 operators (4 groups (each 4<br>
operators) and three shifts) are generally required.<br>
However, the present invention can remove the 16 operators.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[0057]<br>
Next, a best mode for carrying out the present<br>
invention will be described with reference to the drawings<br>
and further the present invention will be set forth in<br>
detail.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, a paper making machine is placed<br><br>
-18-<br>
in which a paper is made by a gap type twin wire former 10<br>
for forming a paper layer by ejecting a paper material J<br>
from a head box 3 into between two wires (a first wire 1<br>
and a second wire 2) each of which loops. The paper<br>
material J is ejected into between a suction (forming) roll<br>
4A and a roll 4B facing each other and between the wires in<br>
the wire part thereby to form a paper layer. The paper<br>
layer is dewatered to, for example, about a raw material<br>
concentration of about 20% while passing through the<br>
suction (forming) 4A, a blade 5, a suction couch roll 6, a<br>
suction box 7, etc.<br>
[0058]<br>
Here, a combination use form of roll means and blade<br>
dewatering means in the illustration shown is indicated as<br>
a dewatering mechanism, and preferably the both are used,<br>
but only one is possibly used.<br>
[0059]<br>
The head box 3 is in a vertical or downstream<br>
inclined state and upward disposed. As enlargedly shown in<br>
FIG. 6, an ejection angle Q which the paper material<br>
ejection direction line makes the horizontal line is<br>
desirably from 50Â° to 90Â°. In high speed paper making<br>
intended by the present invention, an upward head box in<br>
which the influence of the fiber weight is small is<br>
desirable from the viewpoints of texture, the Z axis<br>
strength, front and back difference, fiber orientation<br>
angles, etc. In a gap type twin wire former, when the head<br>
box is horizontal or the like, desirable properties are<br>
difficult to obtain in high speed paper making.<br>
[0060]<br>
A paper layer in the wire part moves- to the press<br>
part and further dewatered. The press part in an<br>
embodiment, in which a first press 21 and a second press 22<br>
respectively have shoe presses 21a, 22a, is made to be a<br>
configuration in which a paper layer is straightly nipped<br>
to remove open draw and prevent paper breakage. In<br><br>
-19-<br>
addition, a belt in the second press 22 is placed on the<br>
bottom side relative to the first press 21 of a double<br>
felt, and the press is configured so as to prevent wetting<br>
again and improve dewatering. Where the basis weight is as<br>
high as 60 g/m: or more and the amount of dewatering is<br>
large, a double felt is desirable.<br>
[0061]<br>
A wet paper of a moisture of about 50% having passed<br>
through the press part, as referred to FIG. 2, moves to a<br>
pre-dryer part of a single deck system and is dried. An<br>
illustrated dryer part is a single deck dryer of no open<br>
draw system and is configured so as to include an<br>
appropriate number of rolls, with the upper side being a<br>
heating roll 31 and the lower side being a vacuum roll 32.<br>
A single deck dryer has little paper breakage in high speed<br>
paper making at 1300 m/min or more that is a target of the<br>
present invention, can perform drying at a high efficiency<br>
and is excellent in quality and operation. Although a<br>
system can be taken into account in which a double deck<br>
system is used for drying, it poses problems from the<br>
viewpoints of operation properties such as canvas marks in<br>
high speed paper making, paper breakage in high speed<br>
drying, cockles and paper joining.<br>
[0062]<br>
In the initial period in a dryer, desirably,<br>
partitioned groups are made many for draw adjustment and a<br>
suction box 33 is disposed for improvement of air passing<br>
through paper and sheet traveling.<br>
[0063]<br>
A paper web dried in the pre-dryer part, as shown in<br>
FIG. 3, is coated with a sizing agent such as starch and,<br>
as required, an undercoating liquid such as a pigment<br>
coating liquid in a size press 40 of a film transfer<br>
(system) between the pre-dryer part and an after dryer<br>
part. The size press 40 accepts a gate roll coater 40A or<br>
the like, in addition to an illustrated rod metaling size<br><br>
-20-<br>
pre-coater.<br>
[0064]<br>
The undercoating liquids that can be used include,<br>
besides starch as mentioned above, starch derivatives such<br>
as oxidized starch, estrified starch, enzyme-modified<br>
starch and etherified starch, and natural adhesives such as<br>
soy bean protein, yeast protein and cellulose derivatives.<br>
As required, a pigment may be added thereto. The pigments<br>
include kaolin, clay, barium sulfate, light calcium<br>
carbonate, heavy calcium carbonate, aluminum hydroxide,<br>
satin white, titanium dioxide, calcium sulfite, zinc<br>
sulfate, and plastic pigments. The pigment, a usual<br>
pigment for a coated paper, is blended depending on<br>
respective pigment properties. Moreover, the adhesives<br>
that, can be used include usual additives for a coated paper<br>
including synthetic resin adhesives such as alkali non-<br>
sensitive or alkali sensitive synthetic resin emulsions,<br>
for example, conjugated diene copolymer latexes such as<br>
styrene/butadiene copolymers and<br>
methylmethacrylate/butadiene copolymers, acrylic polymer<br>
latexes such as polymers or copolymers of acryl and/or<br>
methacrylate esters and vinyl acetate copolymer latexes<br>
such as ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymers. As required, a<br>
variety of assistants can be blended that include a<br>
dispersing agent, a flow-modified agent, an antifoaming<br>
agent, a dye, a lubricant, a water resistant additive and a<br>
water retention agent. The coating amount of a base<br>
coating agent is preferably from 0.01 to 4 g/m2,<br>
particularly preferably from 0.2 to 3 g/m2.<br>
[0065]<br>
Examples of the coating means of a film transfer<br>
system that can be used include a gate roll coater, a sim<br>
sizer, and a blade metaling size press or a rod metaling<br>
size press. Particularly desired is a rod metaling size<br>
press. When this rod metaling size press coater is<br>
employed, a rod having a smooth surface is desirably used<br><br>
-21-<br>
to avoid streak generation in operation. Setting the rod<br>
diameter to be from 15 to 50 mm can obtain more preferable<br>
operation properties and quality. A rod having a diameter<br>
of less than 15 mm is liable to lead to decreasing in film<br>
forming capability and becoming inferior in surface. For a<br>
rod having a diameter of more than 50 mm, the effect is not<br>
changed, and thus a particularly large diameter is not<br>
required. A rod with a groove, a rod winding a wire<br>
therearound, or the like can be also used as the rod.<br>
[0066]<br>
After coating of an undercoating liquid, an auxiliary<br>
drying device 42 using an air turn bar 41 and an infrared<br>
ray is desirably disposed in advance in an after dryer part<br>
in order to avoid the generation of surface dirt.<br>
[0067]<br>
In the illustrated after dryer part of a single deck,<br>
a sizing agent and a pigment coating liquid are dried.<br>
[0068]<br>
Thereafter, in a coater part, an aqueous coating<br>
liquid having an additive and a pigment (clay or the like)<br>
as primary components is applied. In this case, roll-<br>
coating an aqueous coating liquid is adopted from the<br>
viewpoint of the quality of the resulting coated paper<br>
because a flat coated layer is required, at a paper making<br>
speed of 1300 m/min or more so as not to generate paper<br>
breakage and not to generate paper breakage in a second<br>
blade coating apparatus.<br>
[0069]<br>
As such, prior to roll coating of an aqueous coating<br>
liquid, a surface coated with a sizing agent is desirably<br>
flattened by a pre-calender 50 in order to secure higher<br>
smoothness. The pre-calender 50 of the embodiment has a<br>
metal roll 51 on an upper side and an elastic roll 52 on a<br>
lower side.<br>
[0070]<br>
In operation conditions in the pre-calender 50, a<br><br>
-22-<br>
heat roll instead of a metal roll is desirable. Desirably,<br>
the temperature is set at, for example, from 100 to 300Â°C,<br>
particularly from 150 to 250Â°C, and the linear pressure is<br>
set at 50 KN/m. Both the rolls can be metal rolls and<br>
further a caliper control roll can also be used in order to<br>
control the profile in the width direction.<br>
[0071]<br>
A coater part of the present invention subsequent to<br>
the pre-calender 50 has a first roll coating step to both<br>
the faces of a paper to be coated and a second blade<br>
coating step to both the faces of a paper to be coated and<br>
selectively carries out coating.<br>
[0072]<br>
In other words, when passed through the first roll<br>
coating step, the paper to be coated is coated on its both<br>
faces by a roll coater 60. After passed through an air<br>
turn bar 61, the resulting paper, in the width direction,<br>
is dried by a temperature controllable auxiliary drying<br>
device 62 using an infrared ray (having the same function<br>
as in other cases), a first gas-type air dryer 63A, an<br>
infrared ray auxiliary drying device 63A, an infrared ray<br>
auxiliary drying device 67A and a first canvas dryer 64.<br>
Thereafter, the resulting paper is passed through a bypass<br>
pathway Y, dried by a second canvas dryer 68, and then led<br>
to a calender 70.<br>
[0073]<br>
Where passed through the second blade coating step,<br>
the paper is passed through the pre-calender 50 and then<br>
through a bypass pathway X. The paper is, without being<br>
passed through the roll coater, directly led to a first<br>
blade coater 65A, where one face of the paper is coated.<br>
After coated, the paper is dried by an infrared ray<br>
auxiliary drying device 66A, the first gas-type air dryer<br>
63A, the infrared ray auxiliary drying device 67A and the<br>
first canvas dryer 64.<br>
[0074]<br><br>
-23-<br>
Thereafter, the paper is, without being passed<br>
through the bypass pathway Y, led to a second blade coater<br>
65B, where the other face is coated. After coated, the<br>
resulting paper is dried by an infrared ray auxiliary<br>
drying device 66B, a second gas-type air dryer 63B, an<br>
infrared ray auxiliary drying device 67B and the second<br>
canvas dryer 68, and led to a calender 70.<br>
[007 5]<br>
Where, the paper to be coated is subjected to lower<br>
layer coating on its both faces by the roll coater 60 via a<br>
bypass pathway Z and can also be subjected to upper layer<br>
coating by use of the first blade coater 65A and the second<br>
blade coater 65B.<br>
[0076]<br>
The above-mentioned infrared ray auxiliary drying<br>
devices can be used for temperature control in the width<br>
direction in order to mainly each adjust moisture contents,<br>
and their adoption can be selected as appropriate.<br>
[0077]<br>
In the first blade coater 65A and the second blade<br>
coater 65B, a coating amount of 7 g/m: or more per face may<br>
be required in the case of high speed paper making. In<br>
such a case, a jet fountain system capable of making high<br>
speed liquid provision as an applicator is desirable and<br>
raking off is made by a blade. When a coating amount of<br>
less than 7 g/m2 for one face is required, a short dwell<br>
blade coater improved for high speed is also acceptable.<br>
[0078]<br>
In blade coating, as shown in FIG. 10, a fountain<br>
angle a of an applicator 90 in the case where the coating<br>
of a jet fountain system is adopted from 30 to 90 degrees,<br>
more desirably from 40 to 60 degrees, in order to remove<br>
coating unevenness in the flow and width directions for<br>
roll coating. When the fountain angle a is out of the<br>
above range, a rough surface and coating unevenness are<br>
generated. A system having a bevel angel 6 of from 30 to<br><br>
-24-<br>
50 degrees in a blade edge is desirable. The thickness of<br>
a blade is desirably from 0.45 to 0.60 mm. For the<br>
possession of a high hardness, the blade edge is<br>
constituted by a thermal spraying material having tungsten<br>
or alumina oxide as a primary component. For example, a<br>
system, having excellent conditions in coating properties,<br>
has a constitution produced by thermally spraying tungsten<br>
to a base material making up the edge of a blade and has a<br>
Vickers hardness of from 1000 to 1700 Hv.<br>
[0079]<br>
In this case, after blade exchange, cooling means<br>
such as water shower cooling is desirably disposed to<br>
prevent blade burning at a high speed paper making at a<br>
time of new blade touch.<br>
[0080]<br>
Finally, an on-machine calender 70 constituted by a<br>
thermal soft calender is disposed and calender treatment is<br>
implemented. The illustrated calender 70 is a multiple<br>
calender of one stack type of 9 nips of vertical placement<br>
of an optiload type. One stack type of 7 nips can also be<br>
used and also Janus type inclined placement, illustrated<br>
together, that makes the influence of roll dead weight<br>
small is allowable.<br>
[0081]<br>
The calender 70 affects final smoothness and<br>
glossiness. Hence, a variety of considerations are<br>
required in terms of this and high speed paper making.<br>
[0082]<br>
The number of stages of the calender 70 is not<br>
limited so long as the calender has at least two nips, and<br>
a flattening treatment is desirably implemented by a<br>
thermal soft calender comprising a combination of a metal<br>
roll M and an elastic roll D formed in a multi-stage. In<br>
particular, a multi-nip calender, more desirably a multi-<br>
nip calender of 6, 8 or 10 stages is most suitable.<br>
[0083]<br><br>
-25-<br>
On the other hand, a thermal calender may be a<br>
calender in which a thermal medium such as oil is<br>
circulated and heated, but this has a limit of a surface<br>
temperature of about 180Â°C. For the implementation of<br>
paper making at a high speed, as shown in FIGS. 7 to 9, the<br>
metal roll M includes an internal heating device having<br>
electromagnetic induction action capable of split<br>
temperature control in its width direction, and treatment<br>
is desirably carried out at a surface temperature of the<br>
metal roll M of 230Â°C or more, particularly from 230 to<br>
500Â°C. A specific example is a roll in which an induction<br>
coil 71 is wound around an iron core 72 within a shell 74<br>
and a heat medium passed through a jacket chamber 73 is<br>
heated.<br>
[0084]<br>
A surface treatment is performed at a temperature of<br>
from 2 50Â°C to 380Â°C of the metal roll M, particularly at a<br>
temperature of from 300Â°C exclusive to 380Â°C inclusive, and<br>
a paper is not broken throughout the entire layer at as low<br>
a nip pressure as possible to be capable of preventing a<br>
decrease in bulk and of restraining a decrease in opacity,<br>
whereby operation can also be implemented. In short, it is<br>
a mode in which an iron at an extremely high temperature is<br>
contacted for a short time.<br>
[0085]<br>
The methods of controlling the surface temperature of<br>
a metal roll that are particularly excellent for elevated<br>
temperature treatment of the present invention include, in<br>
addition to a method of circulating hot water or oil into a<br>
metal roll, as described above, a method by an "internal<br>
heating device by electromagnetic induction action" that<br>
involves disposing an induction coil around an iron core<br>
disposed in an inside as a non-rotation portion, flowing an<br>
alternating current into its induction coil to generate a<br>
magnetic flux in the coil and induce an induction current<br>
inside an external shell (external cylinder) as a rotation<br><br>
-26-<br>
port on and self heat releasing (induction heat release)<br>
the duts de shell (external cylinder) by its resistance<br>
heat. In addition, according to the internal heating<br>
device by the electromagnetic induction action, there' is an<br>
advantage that an induction coil is divided (e.g., 3 to 6<br>
divisions) in the width direction (longitudinal direction<br>
of the roll itself) and an alternating current amount<br>
flowed into a corresponding induction coil is controlled<br>
based on a temperature signal from a temperature sensor<br>
disposed in the shell, so that the temperature control in<br>
the width direction particularly on the surface is possible<br>
at high precision.<br>
[0086]<br>
In this case, a structure in which jacket pathways<br>
particularly extended in the longitudinal direction inside<br>
the shell are disposed in large numbers, from 10 to 90<br>
pathways, in the peripheral direction at intervals, in<br>
which these are connected to each other, and in which a<br>
heat medium is enclosed in the inside, is more excellent<br>
from the viewpoints of heat due to self heat releasing of<br>
the shell being aosorbed and the heat being uniformed on<br>
the entire roll surface.<br>
[0087]<br>
A surface treatment at elevated temperature according<br>
tc the present invention increases not only the temperature<br>
of the surface layer portion of a paper but the temperature<br>
of the inner layer portion. As a result, not only the<br>
surface layer portion of the paper but the entire layer is<br>
liable to break, so that the bulk is lowered. Therefore,<br>
where a paper is passed for a short time by further high<br>
temperature treatment, heat transfer to the inner layer<br>
portion can be prevented extremely, thereby being capable<br>
of preventing a decrease in bulk.<br>
[0088]<br>
On the contrary, with increased temperature of the<br>
surface temperature of a metal roll, the stress in the<br><br>
-27-<br>
width direction in the shell of a metal roll is generated<br>
and the roll profile is likely to be destroyed, whereby the<br>
controlling of a thick paper profile is decreased. In<br>
addition, when a metal roll depends on an internal heating<br>
device by electromagnetic induction action, the temperature<br>
response of the surface temperature of the metal roll per<br>
time does not seem to be good. Moreover, due to this, the<br>
temperature response in the width direction is bad, which<br>
is a cause of yield decrease because of bad temperature<br>
controlling. Thus, at least either an external heating<br>
device by electromagnetic induction action capable of<br>
division temperature control in the roll width direction or<br>
a cooling apparatus capable of cooling temperature control<br>
in the roll width direction is desirably provided in the<br>
vicinity of the metal roll M.<br>
[0089]<br>
This example will be primarily described in reference<br>
to FIG. 8. The metal roll M includes a shell 74, an<br>
induction coil 71, an iron core 72, a temperature sensor<br>
75, an alternating current source 76 and a jacket pathway<br>
73. With this metal roll M, an internal heating device 77<br>
by electromagnetic induction action capable of division<br>
temperature control in the roll width direction is disposed<br>
in the vicinity of the metal roll M to constitute a high<br>
temperature nip region of a base paper."<br>
[0090]<br>
The internal heating device 77 is an application of<br>
the principle of electromagnetic induction heating. As<br>
shown in the drawing, the internal heating device 77<br>
entails flowing an alternating current (e.g., a high<br>
frequency of from 3 to 20 kHz) from an alternating current<br>
source (inverter) 77B to a work coil 77A to generate a<br>
magnetic field, generating an eddy current on a shell 74<br>
surface portion, and self heat releasing. The separation<br>
distance between the work coil 77A and the shell 74 surface<br>
is desirably from 2 to 20 mirg particularly desirably<br><br>
-28-<br>
roughly from 2 to 5 mm. In addition, a unit work coil is<br>
desirably inclination-disposed so as to cross the shaft of<br>
the metal roll M for the purpose of texture of a profile,<br>
for heating purposes. The zone control pitch in the roll<br>
width direction is roughly from 75 to 150 mm, and the<br>
rating electric power per zone can be set at from 4 to 20<br>
kW.<br>
[0091]<br>
An example of a cleaning apparatus 78 capable of<br>
cooling temperature control in the roll width direction is<br>
as follows. As shown in FIG. 9, air is sent from a fan 78a<br>
to a header 78b and the air is sent into a temperature<br>
adjusting chamber 78d through an adjusting plate 78c having<br>
communicated pores formed therein. Then, a coil 78e<br>
disposed within the temperature adjusting chamber 78d ie<br>
cooled by temperature adjusting means 78f to control the<br>
ventilation temperature passing through a dispersion plate<br>
78g having small pores.<br>
[0092]<br>
The nip pressure in the calender 70' is desirably from<br>
200 KN/m to 450 KN/m, particularly desirably from 300 KN/m<br>
to 450 KN/m. The paper flattening treated by the calender<br>
70 is finally wound by a reel 80, and a winder (not shown)<br>
for finishing winding for subdivision is disposed in the<br>
final portion of the machine.<br>
[0093]<br>
In place of the multi-nip calender shown in FIG. 4,<br>
as illustrated in FIG. 5, for example, a soft calender 70A<br>
including the metal roll M constituted by 1 nip and 4<br>
stacks and the,elastic roll D is acceptable.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
[0094]<br>
Advantages of the present invention will be clarified<br>
by means of examples and comparative examples.<br>
Factors such as a wire part mode, a placement angle<br><br>
29-<br>
of the head box, a suction mode, a coating mode, a thermal<br>
soft calender and a paper making speed, of the present<br>
invention, were changed and quality of paper were<br>
evaluated. In addition, each of the examples did not newly<br>
dispose individual lines for each of all the factors and<br>
testing examples by testing plants were primarily newly<br>
replaced.<br>
[0095]<br>
Quality evaluations of paper are in the following.<br>
1.	Contaminants: The area of contaminants was<br>
evaluated by connecting a CCD camera to an optical<br>
microscope and measuring one sheet AA paper at a<br>
magnification of 8 pm per pixel via an image analyzing unit<br>
(LUZEX AP) and then averaging them for 10 cm'. In<br>
addition, contaminants of 0.005 mm' or less could not<br>
visually be recognized, and thus were neglected.<br>
2.	Texture evaluation: The texture evaluation<br>
stipulated in the example was implemented by obtaining the<br>
variation of a transmitted light amount as a time sequence<br>
signal using a sheet texture tester available from TOYO<br>
SEIKI KOGYO CO., LTD. This measuring device can measure 28<br>
points in the wavelength range of unevenness of from about<br>
0.16 to about 80 mm. However, because 14 points in the<br>
range of from 4.0 to 80 mm in the example were closely<br>
related.to texture indicated by large shades in watermark<br>
texture by sensory inspection, the sum of the coefficients<br>
of variation in the range was determined. When the<br>
unevenness index is less than 6%, the texture is very in<br>
uniform, the glossiness unevenness of a coated paper<br>
surface attributable to texture unevenness hardly occurs,<br>
the-formation of a coated layer is uniform, and printing<br>
unevenness at printing, printing glossiness unevenness,<br>
etc. disappear, so that printing suitability is improved.<br>
3.	Paper breakage: A test operation was conducted at<br>
a paper making speed of 1500 m/min at a constant drying<br>
temperature for 3 hours using a test plant equivalent to an<br><br>
-30-<br>
actual machine and the number of paper breaks due to the<br>
difference of drying methods was evaluated.<br>
o: Number of paper breaks, 0 time; : one time; *:<br>
one or more times.<br>
4.	Cockle: A test operation was conducted at a paper<br>
making speed of 1300 m/min at a constant drying temperature<br>
for 3 hours using a test plant and the number of cockles<br>
due to the difference of drying methods was evaluated. o:<br>
Number of cockles, 0; : one; x: one or more.<br>
5.	Specific volume: Measured in accordance ,with JIS P<br>
8118 (1976).<br>
6.	Glossiness: Was measured at an angle of 75 degrees<br>
in accordance with JIS P 8142.<br>
7.	Glossiness unevenness: Test paper sheets of an A4<br>
size were prepared, and were visually evaluated by five<br>
females and five males on the basis of five criteria.<br>
Level 3 or higher was regarded allowable.<br>
8.	Printing unevenness: Test paper sheets of a<br>
duodecimo size were prepared, and printed using a Rowland<br>
offset printer, left to stand for 24 hours at a constant<br>
temperature. Then, solid printed portions of samples,<br>
overprinted with four colors of black, magenta, cyan and<br>
yellow, were visually evaluated by five females and five<br>
males on the basis of five criteria. Level 3 or higher was<br>
regarded allowable.<br>
9.	Rigidity: Determined in accordance with JIS P<br>
8115.<br><br>
10.	Yellow change (by calender treatment): A product<br>
was prepared to a duodecimo size and the extent of yellow<br>
of the product was visually evaluated by five females and<br>
five males on the basis of five criteria. Level 3 or<br>
higher was regarded allowable.<br>
11.	Productivity: stability of a wet end, dewater<br>
properties in a press part, generation states of drainage<br>
and streaks, etc. in each example in a test machine were<br>
observed by five operators, and each of the evaluation<br><br>
-31-<br>
results was collected and evaluated based on 5 criteria.<br>
Level 3 or higher was regarded allowable.<br>
12. Overall evaluation: All of the quality attributes<br>
were all totally evaluated on the basis of four criteria.<br>
: Good production efficiency/quality, o: No problems in<br>
production efficiency/quality, : Some problems, * :<br>
Problems.<br>
In addition, the roll hardness of a roll coater is<br>
the A hardness value of JIS K 6301, and the hardness of a<br>
blade is the Hv (hard Vickers). The roll surface roughness<br>
indicates the central line average roughness in accordance<br>
with JIS P 0601.<br>
