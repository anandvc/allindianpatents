represent a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms or a substituted or unsubstituted aryl group having 6 to 40 carbon atoms, and A' and C each represent a substituted or unsubstituted condensed hydrocarbon group having 2 to 5 rings.<br>
The organic EL device of the present invention comprises a pair of electrodes and a film of organic compounds which is disposed between the pair of electrodes and comprises a single layer or a plurality of layers comprising at least a light emitting layer, wherein at least one of the layers of the film of organic compounds comprises a novel styryl compound described above.<br>
It is preferable that the light emitting layer comprises the novel styryl compound described above. It is also preferable that an electron injecting layer or a hole injecting layer comprises the novel styryl compound described above.<br>
A layer of an inorganic compound may be disposed between the light emitting layer and the electrode.<br>
The heat resistance, the efficiency of light emission, the life and the purity of the emitted blue light of the organic EL device are improved by introducing the above novel styryl compound into at least one of the layers in the film of organic compounds because the styryl compound has an excellent fluorescent property and the fluorescent spectrum has a peak at a short wave length. Moreover, the change of the film comprising the novel styryl compound by heat is suppressed since the novel styryl compound has hydrocarbon ring groups having 8 rings or more and, occasionally, hydrocarbon ring groups having 10 rings or more and the molecular weight is high.<br><br>
In the novel styryl compound of the present invention, examples of the aryl group include phenyl group, naphthyl group, anthryl group, acenaphthenyl group, fluorenyl group, phenanthryl group, indenyl group, pyrenyl group and fluoranthenyl group.<br>

comprising a film of organic compounds having a single layer or a plurality of layers disposed between an anode and a cathode. When the film of organic compounds has a single layer, a light emitting layer is disposed between the anode and the cathode. The light emitting layer comprises a light emitting material and may further comprise a hole injecting material or an electron injecting material to transport holes injected from the anode or electrons injected from the cathode, respectively, to the light emitting material. However, it is preferable that the light emitting material has a very high fluorescent quantum efficiency and a combination of an excellent ability of transporting holes and an excellent ability of transporting electrons and can form a uniform thin film. When the film of organic compounds in the organic EL device has a plurality of layers, the organic EL device has a laminate structure of a plurality of layers such as (an anode / a hole injecting layer / a light emitting layer / a cathode), (an anode / a light emitting layer / an electron injecting layer / a cathode) and (an anode / a hole injecting layer / a light emitting layer / an electron injecting layer / a cathode).<br>
In the light emitting layer, conventional light emitting materials,<br><br>

By forming the organic EL device in a multi-layer structure, decreases in the luminance and the life due to quenching can be prevented. Where necessary, light emitting materials, other doping materials, hole injecting materials and electron injecting materials may be used in combination. By using other doping materials, the luminance and the efficiency of the light emission can be improved and red light or white light can be emitted.

However, the five-membered ring derivative containing nitrogen is not limited to the compounds described above as the examples.<br>
In the present invention, a layer of an inorganic compound may be disposed between the light emitting layer and the electrode to improve the charge injecting property. As the inorganic compound used for the layer of an inorganic compound, alkali metal compounds such as fluorides and<br>
oxides of alkali metals and alkaline earth compounds can be used. Examples of the inorganic compound include LiF, Li20, BaO, SrO, BaF2<br>
and SrFg.<br>
As the electrically conductive material used for the anode of the<br>
organic EL device, materials having a work function greater than 4 eV are<br><br>
suitable. Examples of such materials include carbon, aluminum, vanadium, iron, cobalt, nickel, tungsten, silver, gold, platinum, palladium, alloys of these metals, metal oxides used for ITO substrates and NESA substrates such as tin oxide and indium oxide and organic electrically conductive resins such as polythiophene and polypyrrole. As the electrically conductive material used for the cathode, materials having a work function smaller than 4 eV are suitable.

The anode and the cathode may have a laminate structure having two or more layers, where necessary.<br>
To obtain efficient light emission from the organic EL device, it is preferable that at least one face of the device is sufficiently transparent in the region of the wavelength of the light emitted by the device. It is preferable that the substrate is also transparent. The transparent electrode is prepared by using the above electrically conductive material in accordance with a suitable process such as the vapor deposition and the sputtering in a manner such that the specific transparency can be obtained. It is preferable that the electrode at the side of the light emitting face has a<br><br>
transmittance of the emitted light of 10% or greater. The substrate is not particularly limited as long as the substrate has a mechanical strength, shows strength at high temperatures and is transparent. Examples of the substrate include glass substrates and transparent films of resins.

For forming the layers in the organic EL device, any process can be selected from dry processes for film formation such as the vacuum vapor deposition process, the sputtering process, the plasma process and the ion plating process and wet processes for film formation such as the spin coating process, the dipping process and the flow coating process. The thickness of the film is not particularly limited. It is necessary that the thickness of the film be set within a suitable range. When the thickness of the film is greater than the suitable range, it is necessary that a great<br><br>
voltage be applied to obtain a specific output of the light and the efficiency decreases. When the thickness of the film is smaller than the suitable range, pin holes are formed and a sufficient luminance cannot be obtained when an electric field is applied. In general, it is preferable that the thickness of the film is in the range of 5 nm to 10 \im and more preferably in the range of 10 nm to 0.2 jxm.<br>
When a wet process for the film formation is used, the material for forming each layer is used for forming the thin film after the material is dissolved or dispersed in a suitable solvent such as ethanol, chloroform, tetrahydrofuran and dioxane. As the solvent, any of the above solvents can be used. In any of the layers of the organic thin films, suitable resins or additives may be used for improving the properties of the films and preventing formation of pin holes. Examples of the resin which can be used include insulating resins such as polystyrene, polycarbonates, polyarylates, polyesters, polyamides, polyurethanes, polysulfones, polymethyl methacrylate, polymethyl acrylate, cellulose and copolymers of these resins; photoconductive resins such as poly-N-vinylcarbazole and polysilane; and electrically conductive resins such as polythiophene and polypyrrole. Examples of the additive include antioxidants, ultraviolet light absorbents and plasticizers.<br>
The organic EL device of the present invention can be used, for example, for a planar light emitting member for a flat panel display of wall televisions, a back light of copiers, printers and liquid crystal displays, a light source for instruments, a display panel and a marking light.<br>

Example 1<br>
A glass substrate (manufactured by GEOMATEC Company) of 25 mmX 75 mm X 1.1 mm thickness having an ITO transparent electrode was cleaned by application of ultrasonic wave in isopropyl alcohol for 5 minutes and then by exposure to ozone generated by ultraviolet light for 30 minutes. The glass substrate having the transparent electrode lines which had been cleaned was attached to a substrate holder of a vacuum vapor deposition apparatus. On the surface of the cleaned substrate at the side having the transparent electrode, a film of N,N'-bis(N,N'-diphenyl-4-aminophenyl)-N,N'-diephenyl-4,4'-diamino-l,l'-biphenyl (referred to as TPD232, hereinafter) having a thickness of 60 nm was formed so that the formed film covered the transparent electrode. The formed film of TPD232 worked as the first hole injecting layer (the hole transporting layer). Then, on the formed film of TPD232, a film of 4,4'-bis[N-(l-naphthyl)-N-phenylamino]-biphenyl (referred to as NPD, hereinafter) having a thickness of 20 nm was formed. The formed film of NPD worked as the second hole injecting layer (the hole transporting layer). On the formed film of NPD, 4',4"-bis(2,2-diphenylvinyl)-9,10-biphenyl (referred to as DPVBI, hereinafter) and compound (1) synthesized above were binary vacuum vapor deposited so that a film having a thickness of 40 nm and containing 2.5% by weight of compound (1) was formed.    The film of<br><br>
DPVBI and compound (1) worked as the light emitting layer. On the film formed above, a film of tris(8-quinolinol)aluminum (referred to as Alq, hereinafter) having a thickness of 20 nm was formed. The film of Alq worked as the electron injecting layer. Thereafter, Li (the source of lithium: manufactured by SAES GETTERS Company) and Alq were binary vapor deposited and an Alq:Li film was formed as the electron injecting layer (the cathode). On the formed Alq:Li film, metallic aluminum was vapor deposited to form a metal cathode and an organic El device was prepared.<br>
When a direct current voltage of 6 V was applied to the organic EL device prepared above, blue light of a high purity having a chromaticity of (0.15, 0.16) was emitted at a luminance of 275 cd/m2 and an efficiency of light emission of 4.5 cd/A. The half-life was as long as 12,000 hours in the life test in which the device was driven under a constant current at an initial luminance of 100 cd/m2.<br>
