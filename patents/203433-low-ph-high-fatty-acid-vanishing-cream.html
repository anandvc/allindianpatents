THE PATENTS ACT, 1970<br>
(39 of 1970)<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See section 10; rule 13)<br>
Title of the invention<br>
LOW pH HIGH FATTY ACID VANISHING CREAM<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai-400 020, State of Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification describes the nature of this invention (and the manner in which it is to be performed)<br><br>
LOW pH HIGH FATTY ACID VANISHING CREAM<br>
The present -invention relates to stably suspended cosmetic vanishing creams of low pH.<br>
Vanishing creams are popular around the world because they spread easily onto the skin giving a thin, semi-matte film which seems to disappear or "vanish". They are also used to counteract shine which may arise from  sveractive sebaceous glands. Moreover, these creams counteract skin dryness to alleviate flaking, cracking and roughness.<br>
The creams are usually formulated with high levels of stearic acid suspended in water by means of an emulsifying agent. Typically the emulsifying agent is a potassium or sodium soap formed by the in situ reaction of caustic potash or other alkali on a portion of the stearic acid. Consequently, the formulations have a pH above 7, and usually substantially above, because of the presence of alkali. Humectants, such as glycerin, are normally also present in vanishing creams.<br>
Emerging trends in skin care have required that vanishing cream formulations be adapted to incorporate skin benefit agents.    For  example,  WO  99/37280  (Bartolone  et al.) discloses vanishing creams which are formulated to include<br>
alkali or alkaline earth metal salts of alpha-hydroxy carboxylic acids into order to achieve skin lightening properties. The disclosure describes the" new products as having a pH above 5. Care was taken in this prior art document  not  to  incorporate  acid  versions  of  the alohs-<br><br>
hydroxy carboxylic acids into the formulations. Unfortunately, the beneficial properties of these skin benefit agents have not been realized in such formulations and thus, it was clear that further work was necessary in order to enhance the performance of vanishing creams.<br>
In addition to alpha-hydroxy carboxylic acids it would also be desirable to incorporate other skin benefit agents. For example, U.S. Patent 5,482,710 (Slavtcheff et al.) discloses the use of alpha- and beta-hydroxycarboxylic acids in combination with salts of glycyrrhizinic acid, alpha-bisabolol and anti-microbial agents including triclosan.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention aims to provide a vanishing cream having a relatively high level of fatty acid and a low pH to accommodate acidic skin benefit agents which enhance the performance of the formulation.<br>
The  present	invention  also  aims  to  provide  a  cosmetic<br>
composition,	particularly  a  vanishing  cream of  low  pH,<br>
wherein skin	benefit agents can be stably suspended, in the<br>
composition.<br>
These and other objects of the present invention will become more readily apparent from consideration of the following summary and detailed description.<br><br>
A cosmetic composition is provided comprising:<br>
(i)  from 5 to 50% by weight of a C12-C20 fatty acid;<br>
(ii) from 0.1 to 20% by weight of a C8-C22 fatty acid substituted saccharide;<br>
wherein the composition has a pH from about 1 to about 6.5.<br>
The applicants have surprisingly found that cosmetic vanishing creams can be stably formulated at a pH of about 6.5 or less by incorporation of - a stabilizing amount of a<br>
C8_C22 fatty acid substituted saccharide. Vanishing creams of<br>
the present invention which have a high fatty acid content (over 5% of, for example, stearic acid) retain the traditional consumer benefits of such products even at low pH, namely good moisturization without greasiness/oiliness, ease of absorption, cool sensation and a matte finish. Addition of acidic skin benefit agents results in improvements in the areas of rough/flaky skin, enhancement of skin cell renewal and reduction of pimples.<br>
Consequently, a . first essential component of the vanishing cream compositions of the present invention is a C12-C20 fatty acid, preferably stearic acid. The fatty acid will be present in amounts ranging from 5 to 50%, preferably from 7 to 40%, more preferably from 10 to 25%, optimally from 12 to 20% by weight of the composition.<br><br>

Compositions of the present invention will have a pH ranging from about 1 to about 6.5, preferably from about 2 to about<br>
 6.0, more preferably from about 3 to about 5.5, optimally<br>
 from about 3.5 to about 4.5.<br>
 Except in the operating and comparative examples, or where otherwise explicitly indicated, . all numbers in this description indicating amounts of material are to be understood as modified by the word "about".<br>
The  following  examples  will  more  fully	illustrate  the<br>
embodiments of this invention.   All parts,	percentages and<br>
proportions referred to herein and in the	appended claims<br>
are by weight unless otherwise illustrated.<br><br>
EXAMPLES 1-8<br>
The following examples are illustrative of vanis"hing cream formulations according to the present invention.<br>
Vanishing Cream<br><br>
EXAMPLE 9<br>
A series of stability tests were conducted to establish the performance of fatty acid saccharides as stabilizing agents for low pH vanishing creams. Table I provides formulations of compositions which were comparatively tested.<br><br>
TABLE I<br><br>
Stability was determined in a 6 months storage stability test. Samples were stored for six months with temperatures alternating from 25°C (room temperature) to 6°C to 45°C and exposed to sunlight. Samples with satisfactory stability within the six month period may normally be expected to be stable for about 2-3 years in the marketplace.<br>
Formulation A employing methyl glucose sesquistearate as a stabilizer provided a stable emulsion without any phase separation. By contrast, replacement with an alkyl pclyglucoside such as lauryl polyglucose at 75%, 100% and 125% of the methyl glucose sesquistearate levels (compare formulations 3,  C and D respectively)  resulted  in phase<br><br>
instability with at least some water leaving the emulsion upon storage.<br>
The foregoing description and examples illustrate selected embodiments of the present invention. In light thereof variations and modifications will be suggested to one skilled in the art, all of which are within the spirit and purview of this invention.<br><br>
