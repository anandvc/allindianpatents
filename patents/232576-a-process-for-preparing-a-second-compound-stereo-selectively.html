				<td>PROCESS FOR STEREO-SELECTIVE PREPARATION OF CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS<br>
EitJROFLTJOEOCX&amp;BOH SOLVENTS<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing a second compound<br>
'by catalytic'conversion1 'bf "a"first compound;'•'- More particularly, -the<br>
invention relates to a process for stereo-selectively preparing a second<br>
compound by reacting a substrate comprising a first compound with a<br>
reagent in the presence of a biological catalyst<br>
' Catalysts are materials that act to increase the rates of reactions without<br>
themselves being consumed" by the reaction. Enzymes are natural catalysts<br>
that in many cases are sufficiently effective to .reduce reaction activation,<br>
energies to the point where the reaction becomes diffusion limited.<br>
An outstanding feature of enzyme catalysis is the observed substratespecificity,<br>
which determines biological function". Some enzymes ntijise<br>
onlyone-biological-substrate-and-are-said--to- -exhibit-ubstrate<br>
specificity. For example, glucolcinase will catalyse the transfer of<br>
phosphate from ATP to glucose but to no other sugar. • Other enzymes<br>
display much broader substrate specificity and are- able to utilise structurally<br>
related molecules which are often dissimilar to their natural substrates.<br>
These enzymes are said to exhibit relative group specificity. An example of<br>
this kind of enzyme is Candida cylindracea (C. cylindracea) lipase which<br>
will, catalyse a transesterification reaction between a variety of acyl donors<br>
and acjrl acceptors. In addition to chemical specificity, enzymes also<br>
exhibit stereo chemical specificity. •<br>
The International Union of Biochemistry has classified enzymes into six .<br>
categories according to the type of reaction .that they catalyse.<br>
Oxidoreductases catalyse oxidation and reduction reactions. More<br>
particularly, they catalyse the oxygenation of C-H, C-C and C=C bonds and<br>
th.e removal or addition of H atom equivalents.,Transferases catalyse the transfer; of various groups such as aldehyde,<br>
ketone, acyl, sugar, phosphoryl or methyl groups.<br>
Hydrolases catalyse the formation of, inter alia, esters, amides, lactones,<br>
Lyases catalyse the addition-elimination 'of small molecules onto C=C, C~N<br>
and C—0 .bonds.<br>
Isomarases catalyse isoiner'isation. reactionssuch .as- racemisations • and <br>
epirnerisations. <br>
Ligases catalyse the formation and cleavage of, C-O, C-S, C-N and- C-C<br>
bonds with concomitant triphosphate cleavage.<br><br>
In nature, some enzymes function within or at the lipid layer within a cell<br>
membrane. The lipases., for example., are active at the water-lipid interface.<br>
The lipid layer provides a non-aqueous and non-polar environment for the<br>
working enzyme.<br>
catalysts are also used commercially in a number of processes in<br>
order to' make use of their stereo-eelectively. For example, enzymes of the<br>
liydrolase class (proteases and lipases) are used commercially for the<br>
resolution of racemic mixtures of secondary alcohols and. carboxylic acids,<br>
in the conversion of prochrral and centrosynimetiic compounds into chiral<br>
compounds and in the desyinmetrisation of msso compounds. The enzymes<br>
 operate most -effectively -in -non-polar-organic solvents, such as hexane.<br>
Increasing the polarity of the solvent tends to result in a rapid deactivation<br>
of the enzyme and/or a greatly reduced reaction rate.<br>
It would be desirable to improve upon the commercial enzyme catalysed<br>
processes by improving the reaction rate, selectivity and/or conversion to<br>
™proaifc3rif wo13d<br>
dissolve a wide range of reaction substrates, which mitigates the .<br>
deactivation of the enzyme during the -reaction and which allows a given enzyme to be utilised effectively across a wide range of substrates.<br>
ha'particular, there'is: a heed for' an enzyme catalysed process that can-<br><br>
efficiently than the known processes that are in commercial use.toda.}'.<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a. process for preparing<br>
a second compound stereo-selectively which process comprises reacting a<br>
starting material or substrate comprising at least one first compound with a<br>
reagent in the presence of a biological catalyst and a solvent comprising at<br>
least one (hydro)fliiorocarbon.<br>
The process of the present invention converts the at least one first<br>
compound, which xna}', for example, be ah achiral compound, a racemic<br>
mixture of compounds, an enaiitiomerically pure substance, a meso<br>
compound, a prochiral compound or a centros3^nnietric compound., into a<br>
particular chiral second compound or compounds stereo-selectively. By this<br>
we mean that the first compound), although capable, in principle, of<br>
reacting to form a mixture of stereoisomers, reacts preferentially or<br>
selectively under the influence .of , the. .biological -.catalyst toyield <br>
predominantly and preferably exclusively one euantionier. Li particular, we<br>
are referring to a process that yields one particular enantiomer<br>
predominantly and preferably exclusively. More particularly., the conversion<br>
of the starting material or substrate is such that the desired enantiornar is<br>
formed at an enantiomeric excess of greater than 50 %, more preferably of<br>
The process of the present invention can provide for good conversions, of.<br>
. the first compoxmd(s) to the second compound(s) at high stereo-selectivities,.<br>
"'Tli'e'corlversi'ons'aiiH' stereo-selectivities may be better than are obtainable in<br>
the known '..commercial processes.. . that use conventional hydro-carbon-'<br>
" "solventssuchas- hexane; F-uirheraibre,  theprocess 'may_prqceed It <br>
rate than processes conducted in conventional hydrocarbon solvents.<br>
It is also believed that the (hydro)fluorocarb'on solvent that is used in the<br>
present process may result in less degradation of the biological catalyst thanwhen<br>
the . same reaction is conducted using conventional hydrocarbon,<br>
solvents such as hexane. This, in turn, could allow a continuous process to<br>
be run for a longer period of time before changing the catalyst or in a batch<br>
process could allow the catalyst to be re-used a greater number of times.<br>
The process of the present invention is conducted in the presence of a<br>
solvent mat comprises at least one (hydro)fluorocarbon. By the term<br>
"(hydro)fluorocarbon" we mean a compound selected from the. group<br>
consisting of the hydrofluorocarbons and the perfluorocaibons. By the term<br>
"hydrofluorocarbou" we mean a compound which contains only carbon,<br>
hydrogen and fluorine atoms. Hydrofiuorocarbon solvents are preferred.<br>
The solvent is usually in the liquid state, although we do not discount the<br>
use of supercritical fluids. Where the solvent comprises one or more low<br>
boiling compounds which are gases at room temperature, the desired liquid<br>
state may be attained by cooling the solvent to a suitably low temperature<br>
and/or by subjecting it to super-atmospheric pressures at some point in the<br><br>
the (hydro)fluorocarbon solvent is mixed with the substrate to be reacted<br>
and, if necessary, continuously during the pro cess.<br>
Suitable (hydro)fluorocarbons may be selected from the CW05 particularly<br>
tlie  and especially theC Xhydrojfluorocsrbons.<br>
 Preferred perfluorocarbons include hexafluoroethane (R-116) and<br>
octafluoropropane (R-218).<br>
Preferred hydrofluorocarbons are selected from the , particularly the<br>
 and especially the "C  hydrofluoroallcaii.es. Suitable Cw<br>
hydroiluoroalkanes include Irydrofluororaetbanes, such as trifhioromethane<br>

hydrofluoroetbanes, such as pentafluoroethane (R-125), 1,1,1-<br>
tiifluoroethane (R-143a), 1,1,2,2-tetofluoroethane (R-134), 1,1,1,2-<br>
tetrafluorpethane (R-134a) and 1,1-difluoro ethane (R-152a);<br>
hydrofluoropropanes, such as 1,1,1.,3,3-pentailuoropropane (R-245fa),<br>
1.1.2,2,3-pentafluoropropane (R-245ca),pentafluoropropane (R245eb),<br>

hexafiuoropropane (R-236ea), 1,1,1,2,2,3-hexafluoropropane (R-236"cb),<br>
1, 1,1,3,3,3-hexaflucttopropaiie (R-236fa)3 I3l,l3233,3heptafluoropropaiie<br>
(R-22.7ea). and. ....... 1,1,1,2,2,3,3-hepfeifluoropropane- ' • (R-227ca); 'aid'<br>
hydrofluorobutanes, such as 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluorobutaue (R-356mfc). The<br>
preferred hydrofluorocarbons are R-32, R-134a, R-134, R-152a, R-143a, R-<br>
125, R-245fa, R-236ea and R-227ea, which are all low boiling making their<br>
removal from' the reaction mixture at the end of the process relatively facile.<br>
Of these, R-32 and R-134-a are particularly preferred, with R-134a being the<br>
mp.st.preferred.—<br>
Solvents containing mixtures of two or more {hydro)flu.orocarbons may.be..<br>
used if desired. The solvent which, is' used in the process of the-present invention 'may also<br>
nse-an':brgaiiicxo-solve<br>
Suitable co-solvents include, inter alia, fluorine free and. more particularly<br>
halogen free compounds. Suitable halogen free co-solvents will typically<br>
have a 'boiling point of 200°C or below, for example in the range of<br>
from -85 Co 200°C. The. preferred co-solvents have a. boiling point of 120°C<br>
or below, for example iu the range of from -85 to 120°C, more preferably<br>
100°C or below, for example in the range of from -70 to lOO'C, and<br>
particularly 10°C or below, for example in the range of from -60 to 10-°C.<br>
• Mixtures of two or more co-solvents may be used if desired.<br>
Suitable co-solvents may be selected from the C2.6, particularly the<br>
hydrocarbon compounds by which we mean compounds containing only<br>
carbon and hydrogen atoms. Suitable hydrocarbons include the alkanes and<br>
cycloallcanes, with alkanes such as ethane, n-propane, i-propane, n-butane, •<br>
butane and n-pentane being preferred.<br>
Other suitable co-solvents include the hydrocarbon ethers, by which we<br>
mean compounds having the formula R'-O-R2 in which R1 and R2 are<br>
independently hydrocarbyl groups containing only carbon and hydrogen<br>
atoms, such as C;,6 and particularly C).= alley! groups. Suitable dialkyl<br>
ethers include dimethyl ether, methyl ethyl ether and diethyl ether.<br>
Still further suitable co-solvents may be selected from the amides,<br>
sulphoxides, alcohols, ketones, carboxylic acids, cafboxylic acid<br>
derivatives, inorganic acids andnitro compounds.<br>
Suitable'amide'co-solvents include the N,N'-dialkylarnides 'and alkylarnidesdiinethjdfonnamide-and fonnauiide <br>
•Suitable sulphoxide co-solvents include the diaUcylsulphoxides, e.g.<br>
dimefhylsulphoxide.<br>
Suitable alcohol co-solvents include the aliphatic alcohols, particularly the<br>
allcanols. Suitable alkanols may be selected from the Q-g, particularly the<br>
Cj-,3 alkanols such as methanoL, etlianol, 1-propanol and 2-propanol.<br>
Suitable Icetone co-solvents include the aliphatic ketones, particularly the<br>
dialkyl Icetones such as acetone. <br>
Suitable carboxj'lic acid co-solvents include formic acid and acetic acid.<br>
Suitable caiboxylic acid derivatives for use as co-solvents include the<br>
anhydrides, e.g. acetic anhydride, and the C^g, particularly the Ci.3 alley!<br>
esters of  particularly GU alkanoic acids, e.g. ethyl acetate.<br>
Suitable nitro compounds for use as co-solvents include the nitroalkanes<br>
and m'troaryl compounds, e.g. nitrometliane-and nitrobenzene.<br>
Although not preferred, when an organic co-solvent is used the solvent<br>
blend will typically comprise from 80.0 to 99.0 % by 'weight of the<br>
.{hyj3rpjfiuoiwarbonand<br>
Preferably, the solvent blend will comprise from 90.0 to 99.0 %'by weight<br>
of the (nydro)fluorocarbon and from 1 to 10.0 %'by weight of the cosolvent.<br>
As the polarity of the co-solvent is increased, it is generally desire<br>
of the co-solvent m order to avoid any problems with<br>
deac-ti vation, of the enzyme.<br>
As water is necessary for the proper functioning of most engines, the<br>
process of the present invention will typically be conducted in the presence<br>
of at least a small amount of water. However., the amount of water that is<br>
used will usually be such that the water does not form a separate phase in<br>
the reaction system. This is because an objective of the present process is to<br>
have the enzyme function in an environment that is predominantly<br>
composed of the (hydro)fiuorocarbon solvent. 'Preferably, the amount of<br>
water is kept below the saturation level of the solvent that is used. More<br>
preferably, the reaction is conducted in the presence of less than 1 % by<br>
weight of water based, on the total weight of the solvent<br>
The process of Hie present invention is conducted in the presence of a<br>
biologlcal catalyst. By a "biological catalyst15, we mean a catalyst that can<br>
be found in biological tissues or systems. Particular biological catalysts for<br>
use in the process of -the invention, are. the. enzymes .and .abzynies . The<br>
biological catalyst must, of course, be capable of catalysing a stereoselective<br>
conversion of the substrate into the second compound,<br>
Typically, the process of the present invention will be conducted in the<br>
presence of a single catalyst although we do not discount the possibility<br>
over<br>
Suitable enzymes for use in the present process.may be selected from any of<br>
Hie six classes of enzymes which have been identified supra:<br>
Ihe enzytiies tnay.be discrete in-the'sense-that they-have been isolated from .<br>
bgicaLtissu<br>
expression in a host organism. These discrete enzjTnes may be used aj;<br>
they are or they -may be lyophilised using standard literature processes, e,g.<br>
as described in Fitepatrick, P. A., KHbanov, A, M., J. Am, Cheni. Soc.,<br>
1991 113 3166. However, we have found that at least some enzymes are<br>
able to function as effectively in a (hydro)fraoro carbon solvent without<br>
prior lyqpbilisation, 'therefore offering the potential of avoiding a significant<br>
processing step.<br>
The enzymes, whether iyophilised or not are usually immobilised using<br>
standard literature processes. For example, the enzyme may be immobilised<br>
on a solid: insoluble matrix, for example by physical absorption ox bonding.<br>
Suitable matrices include, inter alia, glass, diatomaceous earth, silica. and<br>
organic polymers such as polystyrene and pofyacrylate homopolymers and<br>
copolymers. .<br>
Alternatively, the enzymes may be part of a .whole cell culture-suclras'a live<br>
cell culture, e.g. Lactobacillus. acidophilus, a resting cell culture, e.g. dried<br>
baker's yeast which can be activated by warm 'water or a non-viable cell<br>
culture which contains the enzyme and the required cofactor('s), e.g. dead<br>
yeast. The whole cell culture containing the .enzyme will usually be<br>
immobilised on a solid, insoluble matrix, for example .by physical<br>

as Subtilisin carlsberg and Sub tills in. JBPN, the lipases, such "as Porcine<br>

antibody 3 8C2. .<br>
The abzym.es could be lyophilised and/or immobilised as discussed supra in.<br>
connection with enzymes.<br>
The process of the present invention is generally conducted at a temperature<br>
which provides for an acceptable rate of reaction and component solubility<br>
and. which avoids significant degradation of the biological catalyst, tlie first<br>
compouud(s) and the second compouiid(s)/ Typically, the process is<br>
conducted at a temperature in the range of from -60 to 120°C, preferably in<br>
'the'range1 of'from-30 to SO°C"arid partieularly irrthe--range--of-from 0-tO"<br>
60°C, for example at about 20°C.<br>
The process may "be conducted at atmospheric, sub-atmospliftric, ox superatroospheiic<br>

example of'the. order of 10~3 to 'KT* 'mole % of catalyst relative to the<br>
substrate. The precise amount will depend on the activity of the enzyme.<br>
Hie process of the present invention can be usefully applied to -various<br>
stereo-selective conversions. -It is particular^ useful for preparing<br>
compounds that can be used as intermediates in the manufacture of<br>
pharmaceutical compounds.<br>
hi one embodiment, the process of the present invention is used to resolve a<br>
racemic mixture.or racemic modification by reacting that mixture with, a<br>
reagent in the presence of the biological catatyst and (hydro)fluprocarbon<br>
• solvent so as to preferentially or selectively react one of the enaatiozners<br>
forming the mixture to form a new enantiomeric compound while leaving<br>
the other enantiomer largely or completely unreacted.<br>
Accordingly, in one embodiment of the present invention there is provided a<br>
process of resolving a racernic mixture which process comprises reacting<br>
that mixture with a reagent in the presence of a biological catalyst and a<br>
solvent comprising at least one (hydro)fluorooarbon so as to preferentially<br>
or selectively convert one of the enantiomers forming the racernic mixture<br>
into a new enant^nenci.cpjnpound.,_-<br>
The racernic mixture that is resolved in accordance with this'embodiment of<br>
the present invention may be a racemic mixture of R and S alcohols, R. and<br>

In a particular embodiment, the process is used to resolve the raoemic N-Pdl-<br>
phenylaianine alkyl ester, where P denotes a protecting group, by a<br>
transesterification reaction in which the alkoxy group of either the R or S<br>
•enantiomer is exchanged preferentially and preferably selectively by<br>
reaction with an allcanol that provides a different alkoxy group. Ordinarily,<br>
it is the S enantiomer that undergoes the transesterification reaction: The<br>
preferred protecting groups are acetyl and trifluoroacetyl and the preferred<br>
alkyl ester is propyl ester so that the preferred racemic mixtures are the N13<br>
acetyl-dl-plienylalaiiine propyl esters and the N-trifluoroacctyl-dlphenylalamne<br>
propyl esters. The preferred allcanol is methauol. The<br>

In another embodiment, the process of the present invention is used to<br>
prepare a particular enantiomsr preferentially and preferably selectively<br>
from a meso compound by reacting me meso compound with a reagent in<br>
the presence of the biological catalyst and (hydi-o)fluorocarboix solvent The<br>
reaction of the'meso compound is also termed desymmetrisati.on, because<br>
the meso compound, which - is symmetrical by virtue of it being<br>

product. Ail enantiomer, of course, cannot be superimposed on its mirror<br>

The reaction may be conducted in the presence of a hindered amine,<br>
particularly a tertiary amine .such as triethylamine,. The presence of the<br>
aniine may contribute to faster reaction rates and greater conversions.<br>
However, omitting the enzyme can result in 'simpler downstream<br>

The reaction of -meso cis-4-cyclopsntene-i.,3-diol with vinyl acetate<br>

In yet another embodiment, the process'pf'the present invention is-used to<br>
prepare a particular enantiomer preferentially and preferably selectively<br>
from a prochiral compound by reacting the prochiral compound with a<br>
reagent in the presence of the biological catalyst and (hydro)fluoiocarbon<br>
solvent. The reaction of the prochiral compound is also termed<br>
desymmetrisation, because an optically-inactive precursor is converted into<br>
a less-symmetrical, optically-active product.<br>
Accordingly,, in a further embodiment of the present invention there is<br>
provided a -process of preparing a .particular enantiomer preferentially or<br>
selectively from a prochiral compound which process' comprises reacting<br>
the prochiral compound with a reagent in the presence of a biological<br>
catalyst and a solvent comprising at least one (hydro)fluorbcarbon.<br>

The molar ratio of the 2-&amp;thylpropaae-i,3-diol to the vinyl acetate is<br>

The reaction of the 2-erh.ylpropane-l,3-dioI with the vinyl acetate normally<br>
proceeds so that the enantiomer that is formed preferentially/selectively<br>

than 50 %, more preferably of greater than 70 % and particularly of greater .<br>

The process of tlie present invention may be operated in baton mode or<br>
continuously. Where a (hydro)fhiorocarboii solvent that has a "boiling point<br>
below ambient is used, the reaction vessel will typical!}' be a pressure vessel<br>
'that is capable of withstanding elevated pressures.<br>
In the batch process, the (hydro)fluorocarbon solvent is removed at the end<br>
of the process, e.g. by flash evaporation if the (hydro)fiuorocarbon is a gas<br>
at ambient temperatures or by distillation, to yield a crude reaction mixture .<br>
•which can then be purified, if required, to isolate the desired second<br>
compo'ond(s).<br>
In a continuous process, a reactant stream comprising the<br>
.. (hydro)fluorocarbon .solvent and the. reactants is conveyed continuously.<br>
through a reaction vessel containing the catalyst. Typically, the xeaciant<br>
. stream is passed over a bed of immobilised catalyst. The crude reaction<br>
'"mixture that exits the reaction vessel is then treated,, e.g.-in a solventevaporator,<br>
to remove the (hydro)fiuorocarbon solvent and recover the one<br>
or more desired second compounds that -have been formed in the process.<br>
The (hydro)fhiorocarbon solvent that has been removed can be condensed<br>
and. recycled if desired to minimise solvent infantries. Unreacted starting ,<br>
material may also be recycled if desired.<br>
Where solvent is to be recycled, a suitable recovery system for low boiling<br>
point solvents., by which v/e mean solvents having-a boiling point of 25°C or<br>
below, e.g. 0°C'or below, comprises an evaporator into which the crude<br>
reaction mixture emerging from the process is passed, a compressor fox<br>
compressing the vapour generated in the evaporator and a condenser for<br>
coolmg-ttie compressed vapour emerging from the compressor. The solvent<br>
is removed from the crude reaction mixture in the evaporator by flash<br>
evaporation induced by suction from the compressor and the solvent vapour<br>
so generated then passes to the compressor, which may be a diaphragm<br>
compressor, where it is compressed. ' Froih the compressor, the solvent<br>
vapour passes to the condenser where it is cooled and returned to liquid<br>
form for recharging to the process or possibly to a solvent reservoir<br>
supplying solvent to the process. The condenser, which may take the form<br>
of a coiled tube, can be arranged inside the evaporator so that the latent heat<br>
of condensation provides at least some of the energy required to evaporate<br>

A further suitable recovery system for low boiling point solvents comprises • .<br>
' a solvent recycling circuit comprising an evaporator into which, the reaction •• •<br>
mixture emerging'from the process is passed and in which the solvent is<br>
evaporated and a condenser in ' which the vapour emerging from the.<br>
"evaporator is cooled and returned to liquid form -for recharging to the '<br>
process or.possibly to a solvent reservoir supplying solvent to the process.<br>
Heating of the evaporator and cooling of the condenser may be carried out<br>
independently, but in a preferred embodiment an external heat pump system<br>
is used to both heat the evaporator and to cool the condenser. The external<br>
heat puinp system comprises an evaporator, a compressor, a condenser and<br>
an' expansion valve which are sequentially arranged in a circuit through<br>
which a heat transfer fluid is caused to flow. The evaporator of the external<br>
• heat pump system, which may take the form of a coiled tube, is arranged<br>
inside or around the outside of the condenser of the solvent recycling circuit<br>
so that evaporation of the heat transfer fluid in the' evaporator cools the<br>
condenser and provides for the condensation of the solvent vapour passing<br>
through the solvent recycling circuit. The vapour generated in the<br>
evaporator of the external heat pump system is then compressed and passes<br>
to the condenser where it condenses and gives off heat The condenser of<br>
the external -heat pump system., winch may also take the form of a coiled<br>
'tube./is arranged inside or around the-outside of the evaporator -of the<br>
solvent recycling circuit so that the latent heat of condensation associated<br>
with the condensation, of the heat transfer fluid provides the heat required to<br>
evaporate the solvent passing through the solvent recycling circuit. The<br>
condensed heat transfer fluid is then returned through ail expansion valve to<br>
tlie evaporator so completing the cycle-in the external heat pump.system.<br>
As .an alternative to an external heat pump system, an external circulating<br>
heat-transfer fluid may he used to transfer the heat of solvent condensation<br>
to the'evaporator vessel to provide heat for solvent evaporation.<br>
When the process of the present invention is complete, the oi-ude'"reaction<br>
mixture may be subjected t o - a purification step in order-to • isolate-.foe<br>
desired product. The pure product may then, be subjected to. one or more<br>
further synthetic steps; e.g. ' to yield a pharmaceutical compound.<br>
Alternatively, the crude reaction mixture may .be used directly in a furrhei<br>
synthesis. Suitable purification techniques include those that are routinely<br>
\ised in chemical synthesis such as chromatography, crystallisation and<br>

General Procedures<br>
Preparation ofN-trifluoroacefyl-dl-phenylalaninepropyl ester<br>
The.racernic N-rrirluoroacetyl-dl-phenylalanine prop}'! ester was prepared<br>
'using the method disclosed by Curphey, T. I, J. Org. Cheazu3 19795 44.<br>
2805-2807 as follows:<br>
To an oven dried flask was added phenyl alanrne. The flask was then<br>
purged with N2 gas and DMF (solvent)^ diisopropjd ethylamine (1<br>
equivalent) and ethyl tiifluoroacetate (1.25 eq;uivalentB)) were added. The<br>
solution was left to stir at 50°C for seventeen hours, then, propyl iodide was<br>
added (1.25 equivalents). The solution was left to stir for.a. further 72 hours.<br>
The crude product was re-extracted and isolated by column chromatography<br>
using gradient erotica. Stalling with 400 nil hexaiie the polarity was<br>
gradually increased by adding 300 ml 9:1 liexane-ethyl acetate, then 300 ml<br>
4:1 hexane:ethyl acetate, then 200 ml 3.5:1 hexane:ethyl acetate and finally<br>
200 ml 2:1 hexane:ethyl acetate. The isolated yield was 4.17 g, 28%. The<br>
isolated product was then fiuther purified by Kugelrohr distillation followed<br>
by recrystallisation from a mixture of peri-oleum spirit and ethyl acetate (9:1<br>
respectively). The purified N-trifluoroacetylTdl-phenylalaiiine propyl ester<br>
was a white crystalline solid. Product identity was confirmed by NMR and<br>
GC-mass spectroscopy.<br>
Preparation of2-ethylpropane-l,3-diol<br>
The2-ethylpr.ppane7l,3.-diol. wasprepared =as-follows:'•'•;'•'•<br>
To a solution of diethyl ethyl malonate (2.0g, 10.7rnmol) \v&amp;s added a<br>
suspension of LiAlH^ (2.5 equivalents) in dry ethanol at 0°C. The reaction<br>
mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature with stirring and after 1<br>
hour was refluxed for a further 1 hour. After cooling in an ice bath; 1 ml of<br>
.distilled water was added to-the reaction mixture with stilting followed by 1<br>
ml of 2M NaOH solution. The mixture was then filtered, and the filtrate<br>
washed with ethyl acetate. The combined washings were evaporated under<br>
reduced pressure to leave a yellow oil which, was purified by flash<br>
chromatography on silica using 5:1 ethyl acetate:hexane as the solvent.<br>
The product was obtained as an oil in 75% yield. Product identity -was<br>
confirmed by NMR and GC-mass spectroscopy.<br>
R-134a and R-32 were supplied by Ineos Fluor Ltd. and used without<br>
further purification. Both solvents were maintained in the liquid state under<br>
autogenous pressure by conducting the reaction in standard plastic-coated<br>
10 ml glass aerosol bottles.<br>
The enzymes were obtained from Aldrich Chemical Company., Sigma<br>

Example 1 Subtilisin carlsberg catalysed resolution of racemic Nacerjl-<br>
dl-phenylalanme propyl ester<br>
In this Example, the resolution of the racemic N-acetyl-dl-phenylalanine<br>
propyl ester by converting the S enanriomer of the racemic mixture to the<br>
corresponding methyl ester using Subtilisin carlsberg was investigated. The<br>
reaction has been explained in greater detail supra.<br>

inethanoLwas prep are d-in-each of t^e! solvents'ibifexaneytetriiHydfbiuraii, and<br>
acetonitrile. To 4 ml of each solution was added 4.0mg of lyophilised<br>
Subtilisin carlsberg. The resulting suspensions were stirred at room<br>
temperature and samples taken periodically for analysis by gas<br>
'chrornatography for both yield and enantiomeric excess.<br>
•The .same reaction-was also investigated using R-134a"and R-32 as the<br>
solvents. Two mixtures of 10 mM N-acetyl-dl-phenylalanine propyl ester,<br>
200 mM methanol and 4.0 ing of lyophilised Subtilisin carlsberg were<br>
prepared in glass aerosol bottles. The aerosol bottles were then capped, the<br>
caps crimped in place and a weighed quantity of the liquid<br>
iydrofluorocarbon solvent introduced through the aerosol valve from a<br>
larger pressure vessel. The resulting suspensions were then stirred<br>
magnetically at room temperature and samples of the reaction mixture were<br>
taken periodically for analysis by gas chromatography for both yield and<br>
enantiomeric excess. The samples were removed by venting a proportion of<br>
the reaction mixture through the valve . into a sample vial. The<br>
hydrofmorocarbon solvent evaporated in the process to leave the low<br>
volatility residue of the reaction mixture in the sample vial. This residue<br>
was then taken up into a known quantity of solvent containing an internal<br>
standard, if required, for the GC analysis.<br>
The reactams and products showed good, solubility in each of the solvents<br>
examined. The results are presented in Table I. •<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
It is clear from Table 1 that R-134a provides a more rapid reaction and<br>
greater ultimate conversion than the conventional solvents, such as hexane.<br>
Hexane is regarded generally as the best conventional solvent for the<br>
process of Example 1. R-32 shows good performance compared to each of<br>
acetonitrile and tetrahydrofuran and approaches hexane in the earlier parts<br>
of the reaction up to around 1 hour. Both R.-134a and R-32 show excellent<br>
enanrioselectivity.<br>
..Example..2,.: Subtilisin^ catlslerg* -catalysed resdltitiotf ' of racemic" Ktrifluoroacetyl-<br>
dl-phenylalanme propyl ester<br>
Example 1 was repeated using lOinM N-trifluoroacetyl-dl-phenylalanine<br>
'propyl ester instead of N-acetyl-dl-phenylaJaniue propyl ester. This<br>
Example was conducted in order to test the sensitivity of the enzyme-<br>
. solvent pair towards substrate specificity. The results are presented in Table<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
It is clear that with the use of the fluoiinated N-protectuig group, R-134a<br>
provides a distinct improvement in conversion compared to that obtained in<br>
tone. In addition, when the solvent is R-134a, the process appears to<br>
continue at an appreciable rate beyond the 72 hours, whilst the rate<br>
observed for hexane is considerably lower. This may suggest that R-134a<br>
degrades the enzyme to a lesser degree than hexane. This property could<br>
allow the enzyme to be re-nsed to a greater degree in hydrofluorocarbon<br>
solvents than in the conventional organic solvents with consequent<br>
economic benefits.<br>
The rate of reaction in tetrahydrofuran in this process is significantly<br>
reduced compared to Example 1. This shows that the hydrofluorocarbon<br>
solvents, in contrast to conventional solvents of similar polarity such as<br>
tetrahydrofuran, may allow the enzymes to function with greater efficacy<br>
across a wider range of substrates.<br>

In this Example, the enzyme catalysed reactions of cis-4-cyclopentene-l 3,<br>
diol with vinyl acetate in R-!34a and tetrajiydrofuran using Porcine<br>
pancreatic lipate were compared. This reaction has been explained in<br>
greater detail supra and results in the preferential formation of one '<br>
particular eaantiomer. The method followed was thai described in Thai! et<br>
al., Tetrahedron, 1991, 47, 7569.<br>
The diol (L0012g, l.O^nol) and triothylarome (0.070g, O.Trmnol) were<br>
added to 0.5g Porcine Pancreatic lipase (PPL) and vinyl acetete (0.600g,<br>
7mmol). 2ml of a solvent was immediately added and the reaction mixture'<br>
stirred magnetically at room temperature for a defined time. The reaction<br>
using R-I34a was conducted in a glass aerosol bottle using exactly the same<br>
' technique as described in Example 1. Material was removed from the<br>
reaction mixture for GC analysis for both yield and enantiomeric excess and<br>
the results are presented in Table 3.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Table 3 shows that in the presence of taethylanoine, R~134a is as efficient<br>
and selective a solvent as tetraiiydrofaran in the desyminetrisatioii reaction,<br>
using Porcine Pancreatic lipase. Tefrahydrofuran. was found by Tlaeil et al,<br>
to be the most effective of the conventional non-aqueous solvents. ' • -<br>
Example 4 Lipase catalysed reaction of meso cis-4-cyclopentene-l,3-...<br>
diol<br>
Example 3 was repeated using Pseudomonas cepacia lipase. R-32 was also<br>
investigated and this reaction, like the R-1.34a reaction, was conducted in a<br>
glass aerosol bottle. For the hydrofhiorocarbon solvents, no tiletliylamrne<br>
•was added. The results obtarned are show in. Table 4.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
From the results in Table 4, both R-134a and R-32 appear to show a higher<br>
degree of selectivity towards the generation of the chiral mono-ester (b) in.<br>
the early stages of the reaction than tetrahydro&amp;ran. This is shown by the.<br>
considerably higher enantiomeric excess in the products by the 2 hour stage.<br>
In addition to this improved selectivity, R-134a and R-32 showed a high<br>
degree and rate of conversion in the absence of any added friethylamine,,<br>

In this Example, the enzyme catalysed reactions of 2-ethylpropane-l,3-diol<br>
with vinyl acetate in R-I34a, R-32 and chloroform using Pseudomonas<br>
cepacia lipase were investigated. This reaction has been explained in<br>
greater detail supra and results in the preferential formation of one<br>
particular enantiomei'.<br>
: The results that were obtained were compared to literature data obtained in<br>
chloroform (as disclosed in Gill ei al., Tetrahedron, 1991, 47, 7569).<br>
1.0 moiol of diol, 3.9roi»ol of vinyl acetate and. 0.01112g of Pseudomonas<br>
cepacia lip as e were mb;sd with 2rnl of a solvent and stirred magnetically at<br>
room temperature for 19 hours. The reactions using R-134a and R-32 -were<br>
conducted IrT'gtass "aerosol 'Bottles" Win»"uexactly'tlie-'saine '•iechrdque'as:<br>
desoribed in Example 1. The mixture was sampled and analysed by GC for<br>
both yield and enantiomaic excess and the results presented in Table 5.<br>

As with the reactions of Examples 3 and 4, the transformations in R-134a<br>
and R-32 clearly show a significantly higher degree of enantioselectMty<br>
than that observed in the conventional solvent, chloroform.<br>
. .Example 6 Lipase catalysed resolution of racemic I-phenylefclianol<br>
In this Example, the resolution of racemic 1-phenylethanol by converting<br>
the R enantiomer of the racemic to the corresponding acetate using Candida<br>
antarctica B Lipase was investigated. The process was carried out using<br>
various hydrofluorocarbon. solvents and using hexane.<br>
The reactions using a hydrofluorcarbon as the solvent were conducted as<br>
follows:<br>
.. Nc.yozym,43-5• (0,-Q095g;-95l units• ^ 10,1V 000' umts/g'(lmi]iobilised Candida<br>
antarctica B Lipase)) was added to the l-phertylethanol (0.0620g; 0.5rnmol)<br>
and vinyl acetate (O.S609g; lOrnmol) in an aerosol. The aerosol was sealed,<br>
and charged with R-134a (6.0500g; 5.00ml), 01R-32 (4.8000g; 5.00ml), or<br>
R-227ea (6.93OOOg; 5.00ral). The reaction was stirred magnetically at room<br>
temperature (about -20'C). Samples were abstracted periodically by .<br>
inversion of the aerosol and depression of the valve causing expulsion of a<br>
small volume (about 50ul) of the reaction solution into a glass vial. The<br>
sample, was then dissolved in dichloromethane (O.lml) and analysed by gas<br>
chromatography.<br>
The reaction using hexane as the solvent were conducted as follows:<br>
^ovozyin 435 (0.0095g; 95 units - 10, OOOunits/g (Immobilised Candida<br>

5.00ml) was then added. The reaction was stirred magnetically at room<br>
wperature.(about 20°C). Samples, luj, were taken periodically using a<br>
amilton syringe (1 ul) and analysed by gas clirornatography.<br>

hydrofluorocarbons was comparad to the resolution of l-pheaiylethanol<br>
•under identical conditions in hexane. It is evident from the results in Table<br>
6 that reaction is superior in all of the hydrofluorocarbons investigated, both<br>
in terms of yield and enantiomeric excess (e.e).<br>
Figure 1 is a time-course plot for the solvents studied in this Example.<br>
Figure 1 clearly skov's the superior activity of Novozyni 435 ia the<br>
hydrofluorocarbon solvents tested; the rates of reaction in the<br>
hydrofhiorocarbon solvents are greater than in Hexane. Using !R-32, a<br>
resolution yield of 50% of each enantiomer with enantiomeric excess of<br>
&gt;99% for each (S-l and J?-3) was obtained. Similar results were obtained .<br>
when, the reaction was carried out in R-134a or R-227ea However, when<br>
the reaction was carried out in hexane the yields and optical purities<br>
obtained were lower.<br>

5.00ml). The reaction was stirred magnetically at room temperature (about<br>
20°C). Samples were abstracted periodically by inversion of the aerosol and<br>
depression of the valve causing expulsion of a small volume (about 50ul) of<br>
rhe reaction solution into a glass vial. The sample was then dissolved in<br>
dichloromethane (0.1ml) and analysed by gas chromatograpiiy.<br>
The reactions in anhydrous THF-Et3N were conducted as follows:<br>
Novozyra'435 (O.OOlOg; 10 units - 10, OOOunits/g (Immobilised Candida<br>
antarctica B)) or lipase from Pseudomonas cepacia (O.OOSOg; 0.453 units -<br>

acetate (0.0869g; Immol)) and triethylaroine (0.0101E O.lxnmol (Et3N)) in<br>
anhydrous THF (5.00ml) in a. Suppelco™ vial, The reaction was stirred<br>
magnetically at room temperature (about 20'C). Samples, l^ ware taken<br>

Until now, it has been widely accepted that the best solvent system for the<br>
reaction of ois-4-cyclopentene-l,3-diol and vinyl acetate catalysed by<br>
lipases is the THF-Et3N system (F. Theil, H. Schiclc, G. Winter, -0. Reck<br>
Tetrahedron 1991, 47, 7569-7582, S. R. Ghorpade, R. K. Kharul, R. R.<br>
Joshi, U. R. Kalkote, T. Ravindranathan, Tetrahedron Asymmetry 1999,10,<br>
891-899 and C. R. Johnson, S. J. Bis Tetrahedron Lett 1992, 3.?, 7287-<br>
7290). The desymrnetrisation of cis-4-cyclopentene-l,3-diol in various<br>
hydrofiuorocafbons was, therefore, compared •with the same reaction carried<br>
out under identical conditions in THF-Et3N....It is .evident.,£rom,,the.results--<br>
provided in Table 7 that the reaction using Pseudomonas cepacia lipase<br>
when carried out in R-32 or R-134a is superior to the reaction carried out in<br>
THF-Et3N- (as evidenced by the greater yields of the monoacetate product).<br>
When the reaction is carried out in R-227ea the yield of the monoacetate<br>
product is roughly equivalent to that obtained when the reaction is earned<br>
out in THF-EfrjN, however, the yield is achieved in a much shorter time.<br>
When Novozym 435 lipase was used, superior yields of the monoacetate<br>
product were obtained in all of the hydro fluorocarbon solvents used, and<br>
shorter reaction times gave a greater enantiomeric excess compared with<br>
conducting the reaction in THF-Bt3N.<br>
• This is also illustrated by Figures 2 to I I . For example, Figure 10 shows<br>
the superior rates of reaction in the hydrofluorocarbon solvents, as<br>
illustrated by the the steepness' of the curves depicting the consumption of<br>
cis-4-cyclopentene-l,3-diol. Similar conclusions can be made from<br>
inspection of Figure 11. It is clear that the rates of reaction in the<br>
hydrofluorcarbon solvents were found to be much greater than in THPBtgN.<br>
For the Pseudomonas cepacia lipase catalysed desymmetrisation of<br>
ds-4-cvdopentene~l,3-diol, the reaction in R-32 is the most efficient,<br>
delivering * 60% yield of the monoacetate product with 99% eaantiomeric<br>
excess.<br>
For Novozym 435 lipase catalysed desymmetnsation of cis-4-cyclopentenel:<br>
3-diol3 reaction ID 227Ea was found to be. the most efficient, giving a 61%<br>
yield of the monoacetate product with 99% enaiitiameric excess.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
