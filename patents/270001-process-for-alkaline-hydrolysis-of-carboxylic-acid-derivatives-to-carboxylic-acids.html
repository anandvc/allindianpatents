				<td>PROCESS FOR ALKALINE HYDROLYSIS OF CARBOXYLIC ACID<br>
DERIVATIVES TO CARBOXYLIC ACIDS<br>
The invention relates to a method for alkaline hydrolysis of carboxylic acid<br>
derivatives to carboxylic acids.<br>
The carbonyl carbon atom of the carbonyl group of carboxylic acid derivatives is<br>
readily attacked by nucleophiles due to its positive partial charge. The arising<br>
addition intermediate product can again decompose by elimination of a leaving<br>
group. In this manner, it is possible to perform a substitution of the respective<br>
functional group in an addition elimination mechanism and to achieve mutual<br>
conversion of the various carboxylic acid derivatives. Therein, the reactivity of the<br>
carbonyl carbon greatly depends on the properties of the respective functional<br>
group. Therein, electron providing substituents with +1 or +M effect, respectively,<br>
decrease the reactivity, electron drawing substituents with -I effect increase it. The<br>
following gradation of the carbonyl activity results from this, wherein only the most<br>
common carboxylic acid derivates are cited for clarity:<br><br>
Since carboxylic acids or their deprotonated carboxylate ions, respectively, have<br>
the least carbonyl activity, as readily apparent, they can be obtained by alkaline<br>
hydrolysis from the remaining carboxylic acid derivates. Therein, the balance of<br>
these base-induced reactions usually is virtually completely on the side of the<br>
carboxylic acid or of the resonance-stabilized carboxylate ion deprotonated in a<br>
following step, respectively. Therein, the reaction proceeds according to the<br>
following general mechanism:<br><br><br>
Therein, various variants for performing such reactions are known to the person<br>
skilled in the art from the prior art.<br>
However, depending on the respective carboxylic acid derivative, multiple molar<br>
excess of hydroxide ions is required for performing such a reaction. Therein, the<br>
circumstance is to be regarded as disadvantageous in the known methods, that<br>
the required hydroxide ions mostly added in the form of sodium or potassium<br>
hydroxide are consumed during the reaction and present a comparatively high<br>
cost factor resulting in rise in cost of the method as well as of the corresponding<br>
products.<br>
Therefore, the object of the present invention is to provide a more inexpensive<br>
method for alkaline hydrolysis of carboxylic acid derivatives to carboxylic acids.<br>
According to the invention, the object is solved by a method for alkaline hydrolysis<br>
of carboxylic acid derivatives to carboxylic acids having the features of claim 1.<br>
Advantageous developments with convenient and non-trivial developments of the<br>
invention are described in the further claims.<br>
According to the invention, it is provided that red mud is used as a reaction-<br>
promoting component, especially as a hydroxide ion source, for the alkaline<br>
hydrolysis of carboxylic acid derivatives to carboxylic acids. Red mud is a mixture<br>
produced by the Bayer process used for obtaining aluminum. The Bayer process<br>
known per se and not concerned by the invention, therein, includes first release of<br>
AI2O3 from finely milled bauxite with the aid of caustic soda lye. After seeding with<br>
crystallization nuclei, pure AI(OH)3 (gibbsite) is precipitated from the obtained<br>
sodium aluminate solution, which is electrolytically converted to metallic aluminum<br>
in further method steps. There remains a mixture which chemically considered is<br><br>
mainly composed of iron(lll) oxides and hydroxides, titanium oxides, alumina<br>
residues, quartz sand, calcium oxide, sodium oxide as well as residual caustic<br>
soda lye, and is referred to as red mud due to its red color caused by iron(lll)<br>
oxide. Therein, according to the quality of the used bauxite, 1 to 1.5 tons of red<br>
mud arise to each produced ton of aluminum as a non-avoidable attendant. The<br>
amount arising each year is several millions of tons and presents a serious<br>
environmental and disposal problem together with the already present waste of<br>
red mud. Therein, the main problem is the high alkalinity of the red mud due to its<br>
content of caustic soda lye with pH values between 11 and 13. At present, the<br>
disposal of the red mud is substantially effected by storage in sealed disposal<br>
sites, wherein the caustic soda lye exiting on the floor of the disposal site is<br>
collected and returned into the Bayer process. However, this form of storage and<br>
partial utilization is costly and expensive since large disposal site areas and plants<br>
are required, and high cost arise for the transport of the red mud and the caustic<br>
soda lye. Additionally, the long-term cost arising by the deposition can only hardly<br>
be calculated and present an additional economical problem.<br>
A utilization of red mud as a reaction-promoting component within the scope of the<br>
method according to the invention for alkaline hydrolysis of carboxylic acid<br>
derivatives to carboxylic acids therefore offers very different advantages. Due to<br>
its high content of catalytically active components, the reaction is greatly<br>
accelerated by the addition of red mud, whereby an appreciable decrease of the<br>
method cost can be achieved. Additionally, red mud includes great amounts of<br>
caustic soda lye, and therefore it is an ideal source of the hydroxide ions required<br>
for performing the reaction at the same time. Since red mud is available worldwide<br>
in virtually unlimited amount and the alkaline components contained in the red<br>
mud present no cost factor but on the contrary the core of the problem, therefore,<br>
consumption of hydroxide ions during the reaction is particularly advantageous<br>
and desired in contrast to the prior art. Thus, the use of red mud within the scope<br>
of the method according to the invention offers both a dramatic decrease of the<br>
required material, method and disposal cost and an ecologically advantageous<br>
dealkalization of the red mud. At the same time, very different carboxylic acids can<br>
be produced from the corresponding carboxylic acid derivatives in particularly fast<br><br>
and inexpensive manner, wherein they can include all of the compound groups<br>
such as acid halides, aldehydes, ketones, acid anhydrides, esters, thioesters,<br>
amides or the like.<br>
In an advantageous development of the invention, the method according to the<br>
invention includes at least the steps of a) mixing the carboxylic acid derivative and<br>
the red mud, b) heating the mixture to a predetermined temperature value and/or<br>
mixing the mixture for the duration of a predetermined time at a predetermined<br>
pressure, and c) separating at least a first, especially liquid component from at<br>
least a second, especially amorphous component. In many cases, the alkaline<br>
hydrolysis is already started by mixing the educts such that it only has to be mixed<br>
for maintaining the reaction. However, depending on the respective carboxylic acid<br>
derivative, the reaction can proceed so slowly that additional or alternative heating<br>
of the mixture becomes required, respectively. In this manner, the required<br>
activation energy can be supplied to the reaction, and a conversion of the educts<br>
as quick and complete as possible can be achieved with extensive neutralization<br>
of the red mud. Therein, the duration of the reaction can be selected depending<br>
on the respective carboxylic acid derivative, the selected reaction conditions or the<br>
like. Therein, heating the mixture to about 98 °C over a duration of 2 hours has<br>
proven particularly economical for many reactions. However, it is to be noticed that<br>
these are only exemplary values and the invention is not limited thereto. For<br>
optimum adaptation of the reaction conditions to the respective facts, it can also<br>
be provided that the reaction is performed at increased pressure, for example in<br>
an autoclave, or at reduced pressure. After step b), in step c), separation of at<br>
least a first component from at least a second component is effected. Depending<br>
on the respective carboxylic acid derivative as well as the selected reaction<br>
conditions, one obtains further products corresponding to the respective leaving<br>
groups in addition to the corresponding carboxylic acids or carboxylates,<br>
respectively. Thus, for example, in use of thioesters besides carboxylic acids, the<br>
corresponding thiols develop, on the contrary, the use of carboxylic esters<br>
provides the corresponding alcohols. By separating at least a first, preferably liquid<br>
component from a at least a second, preferably amorphous and/or solid<br>
component, which especially includes dealkalized red mud, there is provided a<br><br>
simple manner for separating the heterogeneous reaction mixture into the<br>
respective products as well as for consideration of the respective aggregate<br>
states. Therein, the dealkalized red mud sediments in most cases within short<br>
time and forms an amorphous phase or suspension due to its small particle size,<br>
respectively, in which salts of the developed carboxylic acids can also be present.<br>
Therein, the red mud is simply identified by its intense red coloration. As also<br>
included within the scope of the invention, it is to be considered that further<br>
components and/or further phases are separated, for example to isolate additional<br>
solid or gaseous products, respectively. It can also be provided to separate non-<br>
converted educts and to reuse them in a further run of the method according to<br>
the invention.<br>
In another advantageous development of the invention, it is provided that the<br>
carboxylic acid derivative includes at least a carboxylic ester. The alcohols formed<br>
of carboxylic esters in turn represent valuable compounds in addition to the<br>
obtainable carboxylic acids and are of great commercial interest. The use of a<br>
carboxylic ester therefore offers the possibility of obtaining plural valuable<br>
products in a single method and additionally to achieve dealkalization of the<br>
employed red mud.<br>
In another advantageous development of the invention, it is provided that the<br>
carboxylic ester is a component of a vegetable oil, especially of a rape oil and/or<br>
palm oil and/or soya oil. Vegetable oils are mainly composed of mono-, di- and<br>
triglycerides and are available worldwide in great variety and in great amounts.<br>
Therein, basically, within the scope of the method according to the invention, each<br>
vegetable oil in each quality stage can be employed. Therein, palm oils, soya oils<br>
or rape oils offer particular advantages since they are inexpensive and globally<br>
available starting components and are to be appreciated as largely unproblematic<br>
under environmental aspects due to their biological degradability. However, the<br>
invention is not restricted to these sorts of vegetable oils. Since it is further not<br>
required within the scope of the method according to the invention to employ<br>
highly pure oils, additional cost can be saved by the use of unrefined, coarsely<br>
pressed or contaminated vegetable oils. In this manner, even waste products of<br><br>
the vegetable oil industry can be fed to advantageous utilization and also be used<br>
for obtaining carboxylic acids and further valuable products. It can also be<br>
provided to use the respective press cake or plant residues, respectively, instead<br>
of the pressed vegetable oils, since they also include residual amounts of<br>
carboxylic esters and moreover can also effect dealkalization of the red mud.<br>
Vegetable oils already have a certain amount of free fatty acids, by which a part of<br>
the alkaline red mud components is dealkalized already upon mixing. Therein, the<br>
corresponding salts of the fatty acids develop, which are referred to as soaps in<br>
this case. They can also quickly and simply be separated from the dealkalized red<br>
mud as commercially valuable components and be used for various purposes.<br>
Alternatively, the method according to the invention can also be used for changing<br>
a fatty acid pattern of the respective vegetable oil. A valuable product also<br>
developing by the alkaline hydrolysis is glycerin released from the glycerides<br>
contained in the vegetable oil. Glycerin, which for example finds use in the<br>
pharmaceutical and cosmetic industry as a valuable basic and raw material, can<br>
thus be inexpensively obtained in great amount by use of vegetable oils. All main<br>
and by-products of the method according to the invention can thus be<br>
commercially reused in use of vegetable oils, and additionally allow a particularly<br>
simple dealkalization and subsequent separation of the red mud with the<br>
commercial and ecological advantages associated therewith.<br>
In another advantageous development of the invention, it is provided that water is<br>
additionally added in step a) and/or b). Thereby, optimum adaptation of the<br>
method to the respective educts and reaction conditions is possible. Therein,<br>
water can also be supplied to the reaction mixture in the form of vapor and be<br>
used both for heating and for mixing in step b).<br>
In another advantageous development of the invention, it is provided that step c)<br>
includes at least a separating process, especially a density separating process<br>
and preferably a decanting process. Especially with regard to the large usability of<br>
the method according to the invention as well as the different educts and<br>
products, basically, therein, all of the separating processes common to the person<br>
skilled in the art are possible, with the aid of which separation of the developed<br><br>
product mixture in at least two components is achievable. Therein, besides<br>
thermal or chromatographic separating processes, especially density separating<br>
processes haven proven a suitable method in order to for example separate the<br>
dealkalized red mud present colloidal or amorphous, respectively, from another,<br>
for example liquid component. Therein, particularly decanting processes present a<br>
particularly simple, quick and inexpensive variant of the various density separating<br>
processes and offer an excellent separating power with low technical effort in the<br>
present case. However, it is to be emphasized that the invention is not restricted<br>
to density separating processes.<br>
In another advantageous development of the invention, it is provided that the first<br>
component separated in step c) includes at least a carboxylic acid. The separated<br>
carboxylic or fatty acid, respectively, can thereby be fed to an economical<br>
utilization as a valuable product. Therein, for example, utilization as pure<br>
substance for the chemical industry, use as biologically degradable pest control<br>
agent in the agriculture or deprotonation to soaps can be provided. However, use<br>
as an educt for esterification reactions with short-chain alcohols for biodiesel<br>
production or the like is also conceivable.<br>
In another advantageous development of the invention it is provided that the<br>
second component separated in step c) includes at least dealkalized red mud.<br>
The separated dealkalized red mud can be deposited without problem and without<br>
the necessity of expensive protective measures on the one hand, however offers<br>
very different possibilities for economically and ecologically advantageous further<br>
use on the other hand. Due to its high content of iron compounds it presents a<br>
particularly advantageous possibility of obtaining iron ore or of obtaining metallic<br>
iron, respectively, in its dealkalized form. Direct further use as iron providing<br>
component of an iron fertilizer utilizable in the agriculture is also conceivable.<br>
Furthermore, red mud includes various catalytically active compounds and can be<br>
used for example for dehydrogenation and dehydration of alcohols.<br>
In another advantageous development of the invention, it is provided that step c)<br>
includes separation of a third component including at least a salt of a carboxylic<br><br>
acid. In this manner, there is provided an advantageous possibility to separate<br>
carboxylic acids or carboxylates, respectively, deprotonized during the method<br>
and thus present as soaps, and to recover them for example after acidification.<br>
However, direct use of the carboxylates for example as a detergent or the like is<br>
also conceivable.<br>
In another advantageous development of the invention, it is provided that after<br>
step c), a further step d) is provided, which includes washing and/or extracting the<br>
second component with a solvent, especially a non-polar solvent. By such an<br>
additional step, there is provided a simple possibility of maximizing the product<br>
yield. Particularly in connection with separation of red mud as a second<br>
component, in this manner, driven or adhering, predominantly non-polar product<br>
residues can be separated from the highly polar red mud. Besides recovery of<br>
products, therein, of course, recovery of non-reacted educts is also conceivable,<br>
which can be advantageously reused upon new conduction of the method<br>
according to the invention.<br>
In another advantageous development of the invention, it is provided that the<br>
solvent includes at least hexane. The use of hexane as a non-polar solvent therein<br>
offers the advantage that hexane is inexpensively available in great amounts,<br>
largely unproblematic in handing and again easily removable with a boiling<br>
temperature of 68 °C. For performing the method, however, other non-polar<br>
solvents known to the person skilled in the art can also be provided.<br>
In another advantageous development of the invention, it is provided that after<br>
step d) a further step e) is provided, which includes evaporation and/or<br>
recirculation of the solvent after step d). Therein, evaporation of the solvent<br>
presents a particularly simple possibility for separation thereof from the washed-<br>
out or extracted component, respectively. Additionally, the solvent can be used in<br>
a type of cycle process in an ecologically and economically particularly<br>
advantageous manner upon recirculation thereof after step d), and therefore the<br>
method according to the invention can be performed without appreciable<br>
consumption of solvent.<br><br>
In another advantageous development of the invention, it is provided that after<br>
step c) and/or optionally d) and/or optionally e) a further step f) is provided, which<br>
includes at least partial oxidation and/or reduction, especially controlled<br>
combustion of the second component. Combustion under defined conditions for<br>
example including control of the oxygen supply, the selection of the oxidant or<br>
reductant, respectively, or the temperature control, provides utilizable thermal<br>
energy on the one hand and allows a particularly simple and inexpensive method<br>
for conversion of hematite contained in the red mud to magnetite in connection<br>
with dealkalized red mud as the second component on the other hand. For<br>
promoting or conducting the combustion, respectively, it can be provided to add<br>
natural or liquid gas to the red mud. Depending on the selected reaction<br>
conditions, additionally, synthesis gas, ethene or acetaldehyde can be obtained by<br>
this reaction, which in turn present important valuable products as central starting<br>
components of various chemical reactions. Therein, natural gas offers the<br>
advantage that it is virtually worldwide available in great amounts and allows a<br>
very inexpensive reaction conduction. The employment of natural gas additionally<br>
offers the advantage that the method can also be economically performed at<br>
remote natural gas deposits such as for example Alaska. Advantageously, the<br>
natural gas is additionally desulfurized during the method. However, admixture of<br>
wood, pulp, plant residues or the like is also conceivable in order to accomplish<br>
the combustion of the red mud.<br>
In another advantageous development of the invention, it is provided that an<br>
exothermic reaction energy developing in step f) is used for evaporation of a<br>
liquid, especially water, in a further step g). Thereby, there is given another<br>
advantageous possibility for sustainable conduction of process and for<br>
comprehensive utilization of the developed thermal energy.<br>
In another advantageous development of the invention, it is provided that the<br>
vapor produced in step g) is used for heating and/or mixing the reaction mixture in<br>
step b) and/or for generation of energy, especially by means of a gas/steam<br>
turbine. In this manner, the method can be performed virtually autonomous and<br><br>
independent of external sources of energy, which is particularly advantageous<br>
especially with regard to the often remote and hardly accessible red mud deposits.<br>
Additionally, thereby, the possibility of a continuous conduction of process is<br>
provided, since thermal energy arising during the method can be advantageously<br>
used in various method steps. Depending on the respective reaction conditions, in<br>
this manner, even excess of energy can be achieved, which can for example be<br>
used for operating other methods or for inputting into a power supply system.<br>
In another advantageous development of the invention, it is provided that after<br>
step f) and/or optionally g) a further step h) is provided, which includes separation<br>
and/or division of solid reaction products developed in step f), particularly iron<br>
oxides. Therein, the separated iron oxides present valuable starting compounds<br>
for obtaining iron and are potent catalysts for a plurality of chemical reaction types.<br>
In another advantageous development of the invention, it is provided that step h)<br>
includes separation and/or division of hematite and/or magnetite and/or jadeite<br>
and/or ilmenite and/or feldspar and/or silicates. Particularly the proportion of<br>
magnetite contained in the red mud can simply be separated from the remaining<br>
non-magnetic mineral components due to its ferromagnetic characteristics with the<br>
aid of magnetic separators and for example be further used for obtaining metallic<br>
iron. Separated jadeite can be returned into the Bayer process after its separation<br>
and be utilized for obtaining aluminum. The separated silicates are for example<br>
suited as admixture materials for the construction industry.<br>
Further advantages, features and details of the invention are apparent from the<br>
following descriptions of several embodiments as well as by way of the drawing.<br>
Therein, the single figure shows a schematic flow diagram of a preferred<br>
embodiment of the method.<br>
Rape oil is mixed with red mud and water in a mixer (step a)) and pumped into a<br>
stirring reactor. In this context, it is of course conceivable that the respective<br>
reactants are considered and the pH value of the reaction mixture is adjusted to a<br><br>
respectively optimum value optionally by addition of water, acids or the like. The<br>
mixture is heated to about 98 °C in the stirring reactor and mixed for the duration<br>
of 2 hours (step b)). Therein, an alkaline hydrolysis of the glycerides contained in<br>
the rape oil to the corresponding carboxylic acids and glycerin is effected with the<br>
aid of the hydroxide ions contained in the red mud.<br>
After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture is transferred into a decanter<br>
(step c)), where it sediments within 30 minutes and forms various regions.<br>
Therein, they include an upper liquid phase with the developed fatty acids and<br>
non-reacted vegetable oil as well as a second underlying liquid phase with glycerin<br>
as well as the corresponding soaps of the fatty acids. On the bottom of the<br>
decanter, the dealkalized red mud settles in amorphous or suspended form,<br>
respectively. Due to the small particle size of the red mud, therein, complete<br>
separation into a solid and a liquid phase does not appear. By decanting, now, the<br>
upper liquid phase with carboxylic acids and residual vegetable oil is separated<br>
and divided into their individual components in a further step. Therein, the<br>
developed carboxylic acids can be used for production of biodiesel in an optional<br>
step after mixing with alcohol and catalyst in a manner known per se, while non-<br>
reacted vegetable oil can be returned into the mixer, reused in a new run of<br>
method or also be used for production of biodiesel. The subsequently decanted<br>
second phase with glycerin and the corresponding soaps of the fatty acids can in<br>
turn be separated in another optional step and be utilized or be combusted for<br>
obtaining energy, respectively.<br>
Caused by the small particle size and the great surface associated therewith, the<br>
sedimented dealkalized red mud contains both non-reacted reaction educts and<br>
non-separated reaction products. For maximizing yield, in the present example, it<br>
is transferred into a washer (step d)) and washed with hexane. In this manner, the<br>
residual non-polar or predominantly non-polar compounds, respectively, such as<br>
glycerin, fatty acids or esters can be separated as far as possible from the highly<br>
polar dealkalized red mud and be recovered. Optionally, the washing step can be<br>
repeated multiple times therein. The hexane is separated together with the non-<br>
polar or predominantly non-polar compounds dissolved in it, respectively,<br><br>
extracted or distilled from them in a further method step in an evaporator (step e))<br>
from it, respectively, and returned into the washer. In this manner, the hexane can<br>
circulate largely lossless and in operational cost decreasing manner in a closed<br>
cycle. Instead of hexane, other non-polar solvents such as pentane, heptane or<br>
toluene can also be used therein, wherein the inventive idea is not restricted to<br>
these compounds.<br>
The washed dealkalized red mud is transferred into a further reactor and<br>
combusted with supply of natural gas (step f)). Therein, it can also be provided to<br>
combust (step f)) the dealkalized red mud directly after decanting (step c)) without<br>
one or more additional washing steps (step f)). The air supply of the combustion is<br>
preferably controlled such that the reaction proceeds under sub-stoichiometric<br>
conditions. This allows reduction of the hematite (Fe2O3) contained in the red mud<br>
to magnetite (Fe3O4). The end of the reaction can be determined in particularly<br>
simple manner by the color change of the red mud from red (Fe2O3) to black<br>
(Fe3O4). The thermal energy developing in combustion can optionally be used for<br>
evaporating water. The developed water vapor can either be utilized for obtaining<br>
energy by means of a gas/steam turbine or be returned into the stirring reactor for<br>
heating and mixing the reaction mixture (step g)). In this manner, the entire<br>
method can be performed continuously, largely without external energy supply and<br>
with overall positive energy balance. It can also be provided to use the energy<br>
released upon combustion in further methods such as the production of biodiesel,<br>
the Bayer process or the like.<br>
After completion of the combustion, the solid residue is separated, milled and<br>
decomposed into magnetic iron ore and a low-iron residual mineral stock with the<br>
aid of a magnetic separator (step h)). Therein, the low-iron residual mineral stock<br>
can be further separated in a manner known per se, thereby especially obtaining<br>
residual hematite, jadeite, ilmenite, feldspar and silicates. With at least 90 %, the<br>
concentration of pure magnetite in the separated iron ore is about two times as<br>
high as in qualitatively high-grade natural ore. In methods known per se, iron can<br>
be obtained from the separated iron ore, while the low-iron residual mineral stock<br>
for example finds use as a cement addition material. Thereby, the method<br><br>
according to the invention provides various valuable products such as glycerin,<br>
soaps and iron ore in addition to carboxylic acids, and therefore offers a<br>
comprehensive utilization of the various red mud components.<br>
Example 2: alkaline hydrolysis of carboxylic esters<br>
In a reaction vessel with stirrer and reflux condenser, 200 g of red mud are mixed<br>
with 100 g of 2-methylbutanoic acid ethyl ester, wherein the red mud has a<br>
residual water content above 10 %. Optionally, the mixture can be diluted with<br>
water or an inert solvent as far as mixing without problem is ensured. In use of<br>
liquid carboxylic esters, they basically can also be added in excess and thereby<br>
function as a solvent themselves. The mixture is stirred at room temperature for<br>
about 2 hours with stirring, wherein the 2-methylbutanoic acid ethyl ester<br>
saponifies to 2-methylbutanoic acid and ethanol. Optionally, towards the end of<br>
the reaction time, the reaction temperature can be increased and the mixture be<br>
boiled at reflux in order to ensure a conversion as complete as possible. After<br>
cooling, the mixture is filtered and the liquid phase is extracted plural times with<br>
hexane. The combined organic phases are subsequently dried over calcium<br>
chloride and the hexane is subsequently extracted at the rotary evaporator for<br>
recovery. The remaining liquid phase can optionally be further cleaned by<br>
distillation.<br>
Example 3: alkaline hydrolysis of carboxylic chlorides<br>
In a reaction vessel with reflux condenser, drying tube and dropping funnel, 5 g of<br>
red mud are mixed with 20 g of pyridine. With stirring, about 2 g of benzoyl<br>
chloride are carefully added in drops. After occurred addition, the mixture is<br>
heated on the water bath for 10 minutes. Alternatively, it can also be stirred at<br>
room temperature for 1 hour. After cooling, one adds ice water and filtrates the<br>
mixture through a glass frit, wherein the dealkalized red mud contained in the<br>
amorphous filter cake is post-washed with ice water. Alternatively, the dealkalized<br>
red mud can also be separated from the liquid phase by sedimentation and<br>
subsequent decantation. Subsequently, the filtrate is acidified with concentrated<br><br>
hydrochloric acid and three times extracted with ether. The combined ethereal<br>
phases are sequentially washed with saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate and<br>
saturated sodium chloride solution and dried over sodium sulfate. Finally, it is<br>
filtrated and optionally the obtained benzoic acid is recrystallized after extracting<br>
the solvent.<br>
Example 4: alkaline hydrolysis of carboxylic anhydrides<br>
In a reaction vessel with reflux condenser, drying tube and dropping funnel, 20 g<br>
of red mud is mixed with as much water as reliable mixing is ensured. With<br>
vigorous stirring, one adds about 5 g of maleic anhydride in drops. After occurred<br>
addition, the mixture is heated on the water bath for 20 minutes and poured into<br>
ice water after cooling. The dealkalized red mud is sucked through a glass frit and<br>
washed with ice water. The liquid phase is processed in known manner in order to<br>
obtain the product maleic acid.<br>
Example 5: alkaline hydrolysis of carboxylic acid amides<br>
50 g of red mud are suspended with 200 ml of triethylene glycol and mixed with 10<br>
g of tridecan acid amide. The mixture is boiled at reflux for about 4 hours with<br>
stirring until development of ammonia is no longer observed. After cooling, one<br>
adds 300 ml water and acidifies the mixture with 20 % sulfuric acid. After<br>
sedimentation of the red mud, the precipitated tridecan acid is removed, washed<br>
with water and optionally cleaned by recrystallization. For maximizing yield, the red<br>
mud is shaken out with hexane and the hexane is subsequently extracted in<br>
vacuum after drying over sodium sulfate.<br>
Example 6: alkaline hydrolysis of vegetable oil<br>
Red mud is mixed with water and vegetable oil in a high-pressure reactor. Rape<br>
oil, soya oil or palm oil can for example be used as the vegetable oil.<br>
Subsequently, the mixture is heated to a temperature of about 250 °C for 2 hours<br>
at a pressure of 50 bar, thereby hydrolyzing the vegetable oil to free carboxylic<br><br>
acids and glycerin. The carboxylic acids ascend during the reaction and can be<br>
removed there.<br>
Example 7: alkaline hydrolysis of thioesters<br>
10 g of red mud are mixed with 50 ml of water. Subsequently, 5 g of cyclohexyl<br>
thioacetate are dropped thereto and stirred at room temperature for 30 min. After<br>
processing the mixture in known manner, dealkalized red mud, acetic acid and<br>
cyclohexanethiol can be isolated as products.<br><br>
