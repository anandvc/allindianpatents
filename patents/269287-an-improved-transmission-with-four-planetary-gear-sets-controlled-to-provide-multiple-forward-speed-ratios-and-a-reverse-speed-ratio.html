CROSS Ri:il RENC1-: TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
|0()011 This application claims the benefit of United States Provisional Application Number<br>
60/909,150, filed March 30'\ 2007, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
TECHNICAL HliLD<br>
|00021	The present invention relates to a power transmission having four planetary gear<br>
sets that are controlled by five torque-transmitting devices to provide eight forward speed<br>
ratios and one reverse speed ratio.<br>
BACKGROUND OE THE INVENTION<br>
100031	Passenger vehicles include a powertrain that is comprised of an engine, multi<br>
speed transmission, and a differential or final drive. The multi-speed transmission increases<br>
the overall operating range of the vehicle by permitting the engine to operate through its torque<br>
range a number of times. The number of forward speed ratios that are available in the<br>
transmission determines the number of times the engine torque range is repeated. Early<br>
automatic transmissions had two speed ranges. This severely limited the overall speed range<br>
of (lie vehicle and therefore required a relatively large engine that could produce a wide speed<br>
and torque range. This resulted in the engine operating at a specific fuel consumption point<br>
during cruising, other than the most efficient point. Therefore, manually-shifted (countershaft<br>
transmissions) were the most popular.<br>
[0004]	With the advent of three- and four-speed automatic transmissions, the automatic<br>
shifting (planetary gear) transmission increased in popularity with the motoring public. These<br>
transmissions improved the operating performance and fuel economy of the vehicle. The<br>
increased number of speed ratios reduces the step size between ratios and therefore improves<br><br>
2<br>
the shift quality of the transmission by making the ratio interchanges substantially<br>
imperceptible to the operator under normal vehicle acceleration.<br>
|0()()5]	Six-speed transmissions offer several advantages over four- and five-speed<br>
transmissions, including improved vehicle acceleration and improved fuel economy. While<br>
many trucks employ power transmissions having six or more forward speed ratios, passenger<br>
cars are still manufactured with three- and four-speed automatic transmissions and relatively<br>
few liv or six speed devices due to the size and complexity of these transmissions.<br>
100061	Seven-, eightv and nine-speed transmissions provide further improvements in<br>
acceleration and fuel economy over six-speed transmissions. However, like the six speed<br>
transmissions discussed above, the development of seven-, eight- and nine-speed transmissions<br>
has been precluded because of complexity, size and cost.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
100071	The present invention provides an improved transmission having four planetary<br>
gear sets controlled to provide at least eight forward speed ratios and at least one reverse speed<br>
ratio.<br>
10008J	The transmission family of the present invention has four planetary gear sets,<br>
each of which includes a first, second and third member, which members may comprise a sun<br>
gear, a ring gear, or a planet carrier assembly member, in any order.<br>
100091	In referring to the first, second, third and fourth gear sets in this description and<br>
in iiic claims, these sets may be counted "first" to "fourth" in any order in the drawing (i.e.,<br>
leu lo right, right to left, etc.). Additionally, the first, second or third members of each gear<br>
set may be counted "first" to "third" in any order in the drawing (i.e., top to bottom, bottom<br>
to top, etc.) for each gear set.<br>
[0010|	Each carrier member can be either a single-pinion carrier member (simple) or a<br>
double-pinion carrier member (compound). Embodiments with long pinions are also possible.<br><br>

100331	The planetary gear arrangement also includes five torque-transmitting devices<br>
80, 82, 84, 86 and 88. The torque-transmitting device 80 is a stationary-type torque<br>
transmitting device, commonly termed brake or reaction clutch. The torque-transmitting<br>
devices 82, 84, 86 and 88 are rotating-type torque-transmitting devices, commonly termed<br>
cl niches.<br>
|0034]	The input member 17 is continuously connected with the planet carrier assembly<br>
member 36 of the planetary gear set 30. The output member 19 is continuously connected<br>

|0()39|	Referring to Figure lc, the embodiment of powertrain 10 depicted in Fig. la is<br>
illustrated in a lever diagram format. A lever diagram is a schematic representation of the<br>
components of a mechanical device such as an automatic transmission. Fach individual lever<br>
represents a planetary gcarset, wherein the three basic mechanical components of the planetary<br><br>
7<br>
gear arc each represented by a node. Therefore, a single lever contains three nodes: one for<br>
the sun gear member, one for the planet gear carrier member, and one for the ring gear<br>
member. The relative length between the nodes of each lever can be used to represent the ring<br>
to sun ratio of each respective gearset. These lever ratios, in turn, are used to vary the gear<br>
ratios of the transmission in order to achieve appropriate ratios and ratio progression.<br>
Mechanical couplings or interconnections between the nodes of the various planetary gear sets<br>
are illustrated by thin, horizontal lines and torque transmitting devices such as clutches and<br>
brakes are presented as interleaved fingers. If the device is a brake, one set of the fingers is<br>
grounded. Further explanation of the format, purpose and use of lever diagrams can be found<br>
in SAIi Paper 810102, authored by Benford, Howard and Leising, Maurice, "The Lever<br>
Analogy: A New Tool in Transmission Analysis", 1981, which is hereby fully incorporated by<br>
reference.<br>
[0()40|	The powertrain 10 includes an input member 17 continuously connected with the<br>
ent.ine 12, an output member 19 continuously connected with the final drive 16, a first<br>
planetary gear set 20A having three nodes: a first node 22A, a second node 26A and a third<br>
node 24A; a second planetary gear set 30A having three nodes: a first node 32A, a second<br>
node 36A and a third node 34A; a third planetary gear set 40A having three nodes: a first node<br>
42A, a second node 46A and a third node 44A; and a fourth planetary gear set 50A having<br>
three nodes: a first node 52A, a second node 56A and a third node 54A.<br>
[00411	The input member 17 is continuously connected with the node 36A and the<br>
output member 19 is continuously connected with the node 46A. The node 24A is<br>
continuously connected with the transmission housing 60.<br>
[0042|	The node 22A is continuously connected with the node 32A. The node 46A is<br>
continuously connected with the node 34A. The node 44A is continuously connected with the<br>
node 56A.<br>
[0043|	A first torque-transmitting device, such as brake 80, selectively connects node<br>
22A with the transmission housing 60. A second torque-transmitting device, such as clutch 82,<br><br>
8<br>
selectively connects the node 26A with node 44A. A third torque-transmitting device, such as<br>
clinch 84, selectively connects node 36A with node 42A. A fourth torque-transmitting device,<br>
sucli as clutch 86, selectively connects the node 34A with the node 42A. A fifth torque-<br>
transmitting device, such as clutch 88, selectively connects the node 34A with the node 52A.<br>
100-141	To establish ratios, three torque-transmitting devices are engaged for each gear<br>
staic. The engaged torque-transmitting devices are represented by an "X" in each respective<br>
row in Figure lb. For example, to establish reverse gear, the brake 80, clutch 82 and clutch<br>
88 arc engaged. The brake 80 engages the node 22A with the transmission housing 60. The<br>
clinch 82 engages the node 26A with the node 44A. The clutch 88 engages the node 34A with<br>
the node 52A. Likewise, the eight forward ratios are achieved through different combinations<br>
of clutch engagement as per Figure lb.<br>
[0045|	The powcrtrain 10 may share components with a hybrid vehicle, and such a<br>
combination may be operable in a "charge-depleting mode". For purposes of the present<br>
in\ cnlion. a "charge-depleting mode" is a mode wherein the vehicle is powered primarily by an<br>
electric motor/generator such that a battery is depleted or nearly depleted when the vehicle<br>
reaches its destination. In other words, during the charge-depleting mode, the engine 12 is only<br>
operated to the extent necessary to ensure that the battery is not depleted before the destination is<br>
reached. A conventional hybrid vehicle operates in a "charge-sustaining mode", wherein if the<br>
battery charge level drops below a predetermined level (e.g., 25%) the engine is automatically<br>
run to recharge the battery. Therefore, by operating in a charge-depleting mode, the hybrid<br>
vehicle can conserve some or all of the fuel that would otherwise be expended to maintain the<br>
25% battery charge level in a conventional hybrid vehicle. It should be appreciated that a hybrid<br>
vehicle powcrtrain is preferably only operated in the charge-depleting mode if the battery can be<br>
recharged alter the destination is reached by plugging it into an energy source.<br>
[00-16]	While the best modes for carrying out the invention have been described in<br>
detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will recognize various<br><br>

The transmission has a plurality of members that can be utilized in powertrains to<br>
provide eight forward speed ratios and one reverse speed ratio. The transmission includes four<br>
planetary gear sets having five torque-transmitting devices, three fixed interconnections and a<br>
grounded member. The powertrain includes an engine and torque converter that is continuously<br>
connected to at least one of the planetary gear members and an output member that is<br>
continuously connected with another one of the planetary gear members. The five torque-transmitting<br>
devices provide interconnections between various gear members, and with the<br>
transmission housing, and are operated in combinations of three to establish at least eight<br>
forward speed ratios and at least one reverse speed ratio.<br></td>
