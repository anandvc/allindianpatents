Valve for regulating an exhaust gas flow of an internal<br>
combustion engine, heat exchanger for exhaust gas cooling, system having at least one valve and having at<br>
least one heat exchanger<br>
The present invention relates to a valve for regulating an exhaust gas flow of an internal combustion engine according to' the preamble of claim 1 and to a heat exchanger for cooling exhaust gas having at least one valve, and a system having at least one valve and having at least one heat exchanger.<br>
In order to meet the current and future exhaust gas emission regulations, cooled exhaust gas recirculation is being used in diesel engines and/or spark ignition engines for passenger cars or for utility vehicles as a means of reducing the nitrogen oxide emissions (NOx) . Reliability problems of these systems are caused, for example, by failures or faults in a EGR valve which are due to the thermal loading by the hot exhaust gas stream or the formation of deposits from the exhaust gas stream. An EGR valve controls, in particular, the mass flow of recirculated exhaust gas which can flow through a heat exchanger, in particular an exhaust gas heat exchanger. The EGR valve can usually be actuated or activated electrically or pneumatically. The EGR valve can have various open-loop or closed-loop control positions. In a first position, the EGR valve prevents, for example, exhaust gas from flowing through the exhaust gas heat exchanger. In a second position, for example the entire mass flow of recirculated exhaust gas flows through the exhaust gas heat exchanger. In a third position of the EGR valve, a mass flow of recirculated gas flows through the exhaust gas heat exchanger, said mass flow being between zero mass flow of recirculated gas and the maximum mass flow of recirculated gas.<br><br>
The EGR valve can be arranged downstream or upstream of the heat exchanger, in particular of the exhaust gas cooler. In addition, the EGR valve can be arranged in, or adjacent to, the exhaust gas cooler. In a further embodiment, the EGR valve can be embodied in one piece with the heat exchanger, in particular the exhaust gas cooler.<br>
The EGR valve and the heat exchanger, in particular the exhaust gas cooler, can be arranged in a system having at least one internal combustion engine and at least one turbine, with which, in particular, a compressor for supercharging charge air or charge air and exhaust gas can be driven, on the outflow side of the turbine, i.e. on the low pressure side, or on the inflow side of the turbine, i.e. on the high pressure side.<br>
When the EGR valve is arranged on the inflow side of the heat exchanger, in particular of the exhaust gas cooler, the EGR valve is subjected to high temperature requirements owing to the hot exhaust gas. It is known in this context that the temperature requirement of the EGR valve can be reduced if the exhaust gas is not fed directly to the EGR valve from the exhaust section but instead the recirculated exhaust gas is not fed to the EGR valve and/or the exhaust gas heat exchanger until it has passed through the cylinder head of the engine. As a result of this routing of exhaust gas, heat is already extracted from the hot exhaust gas by the engine coolant before said hot exhaust gas is in contact with the EGR valve. Nevertheless, the EGR valve still experiences very high temperature loading.<br>
The arrangement of the EGR valve downstream of the exhaust gas cooler is usually selected in order to reduce the temperature loading of the EGR valve and of the corresponding actuator, in particular of the electrical or pneumatic actuator. However, it is disadvantageous here that the unburnt hydrocarbons (HC)<br><br>
which are contained in the exhaust gas form deposits on the EGR valve in conjunction with soot particles. As a result of the relatively low gas temperatures after the exhaust gas has flowed through the exhaust gas heat exchanger, the deposits which are formed in the EGR valve can be removed again only with difficulty since, for example, the deposits can only be burnt off with difficulty. The deposits cause the valve to become blocked due to sooting up or carbonizing and is therefore no longer functionally capable.<br>
On the other hand, arranging the EGR valve on the inflow side of the exhaust gas cooler makes it possible, owing to the high exhaust gas temperatures upstream of the exhaust gas heat exchanger, to burn off the deposits which are formed, for example in relatively high-load operating states of the internal combustion engine. However, the high temperature loading of the EGR valve also leads to heavy loading of the actuator. Even after the recirculated exhaust gas cools in the cylinder head, the actuator and EGR valve are still heavily loaded by the engine coolant.<br>
The applicant's unpublished document DE 102 005 029 322.0 discloses an EGR valve and an arrangement for recirculating and cooling exhaust gas of an internal combustion engine with an EGR valve. In one exemplary embodiment, the valve device is arranged here on the inflow side of a high temperature cooler, or in another exemplary embodiment the exhaust gas cooler is arranged on the outflow side.<br>
In addition, in the applicant's document DE 102 005 048 911.7, which is also still unpublished, an arrangement is disclosed for recirculating and cooling exhaust gas of an internal combustion engine in which an EGR valve is arranged on the outflow side of an exhaust gas cooler. In the applicant's document DE 102 005 049 309.2, which is also still unpublished.<br><br>
an EGR valve is disclosed, which has, in particular, an oxidation catalytic converter on the inflow side of an exhaust gas cooler.<br>
In the applicant's unpublished document DE 102 005 044 088.6, it is disclosed that an EGR valve is integrated into the inlet diffuser of a heat exchanger, in particular of an exhaust gas heat exchanger.<br>
The object of the present invention is to improve a valve of the type mentioned at the beginning.<br>
The object is achieved by means of the features of claim 1.<br>
Further advantageous refinements of the invention emerge from the subclaims and from the drawings.<br>
A valve is proposed for regulating an exhaust gas flow of an internal combustion engine which has at least one closure element and at least one actuator for activating the closure element, wherein the valve has at least one heat transfer duct for cooling the valve, through which heat transfer duct at least one first medium can flow.<br>
The at last one closure element can perform open-loop or closed-loop control on, in particular, a mass flow of a second medium such as, for example, exhaust gas. The closure element can be actuated by means of an actuator. The valve has at least one heat transfer duct for cooling the valve, through which heat transfer duct at least one medium, in particular coolant such as cooling fluid or air can flow or does flow.<br>
In one advantageous development, the heat transfer duct is embodied as an annular duct. The first medium, in particular  cooling  fluid  or  air,  can  particularly<br><br>
advantageously flow from an inlet opening to an outlet opening here.<br>
In addition it is possible to provide that the heat transfer duct has at least one wall pairing whose walls are embodied concentrically with respect to one another. In this way, the flow duct can particularly advantageously be formed in a plate by means of primary shaping fabrication methods such as, for example, injection molding, or by means of a material-removing fabrication method such as, for example, milling.<br>
In one advantageous development, the valve has at least a first opening for the inflow of the first medium and/or at least a second opening for the outflow of the first medium. In this way, the first medium can particularly advantageously flow through the heat transfer duct via the first opening, and the first medium can particularly advantageously flow out again from the second opening after it has flowed through the heat transfer duct.<br>
In addition it is possible to provide that the first medium is coolant, in particular a cooling fluid or air. In this way, the valve can be cooled particularly advantageously.<br>
Furthermore, it can particularly preferably be provided that the valve has at least one plate in which the heat transfer duct is arranged. In this way, the heat transfer duct can particularly advantageously be provided in the plate, for example by means of a primary shaping fabrication method such as injection molding, or by means of a material-removing fabrication method such as milling or drilling, and can particularly advantageously be connected to the valve.<br>
In a further advantageous embodiment, the plate has reinforcing devices and/or cavities in order to save<br><br>
weight. In this way, the plate can be made particularly lightweight.<br>
In addition it is possible to provide that the plate is connected to a valve housing in a materially joined and/or positively locking fashion. In this way, the plate can particularly advantageously be connected to the valve housing, for example by soldering, welding, bonding etc. and/or particularly advantageously connected in a positively locking fashion.<br>
In a further advantageous development, the plate is embodied in one piece with the valve housing. In this way, it is possible, in particularly advantageous way, to make savings in terms of assembly processes.<br>
In addition it is possible to provide that the plate has at least a first flange face for fastening purposes. It is particularly advantageously possible to fasten other components, for example an inlet diffuser and so on, to this flange face.<br>
A further advantageous refinement is characterized in that at least one aperture for preventing a flow around the heat transfer duct is arranged in the heat transfer duct. This can particularly advantageously prevent first medium, such as for example coolant or air, from flowing from the first opening, in particular the inlet opening, directly to the second opening, in particular to the outlet opening, and in the process not flowing through the heat transfer duct, as a result of which the valve element would not be correspondingly cooled.<br>
Furthermore, it can particularly preferably be provided that the valve has at least one sealing element, in particular a flat seal. This can particularly advantageously prevent media, such as for example the first medium, from escaping from the valve and/or other media entering the valve.<br><br>
According to the invention, a heat exchanger for cooling exhaust gas having at least one valve as claimed in one of claims 1 to 12 is also proposed.<br>
In one particularly preferred embodiment, the heat exchanger has a first flow duct through which the first medium and/or a second medium can flow. In this way, the first medium, which has in particular previously flowed through the valve, can particularly advantageously be made to flow through the heat exchanger, and/or a second medium can particularly advantageously be made to flow through the heat exchanger.<br>
Furthermore, it can particularly advantageously be provided that the heat exchanger has a second flow duct through which a third medium can flow. In this way, the third medium, such as for example exhaust gas, can particularly advantageously be made to flow through the heat exchanger, in particular, the exhaust gas heat exchanger.<br>
In addition, it is possible to provide that the second medium is a cooling fluid or air and/or the third medium is exhaust gas. In this way, the third medium, in particular exhaust gas, can be particularly advantageously cooled by the second medium, in particular the cooling fluid or the air.<br>
In one advantageous development, the heat exchanger has an inlet diffuser for the third medium. In this way, the third medium can in particular advantageously be made to flow through the heat exchanger via the inlet diffuser.<br>
In addition, it is possible to provide that the inlet diffuser has a second flange face which can be connected to the first flange face of the valve.  In<br><br>
this way, the valve can particularly advantageously be connected to the heat exchanger.<br>
Furthermore, it can particularly preferably be provided that the sealing element for sealing the valve with respect to the inlet diffuser is arranged between the first flange face and the second flange face. In this way, the valve can particularly advantageously be sealed with respect to the inlet diffuser, and the inlet diffuser can particularly advantageously be sealed with respect to the sealing element.<br>
In a further advantageous refinement, the heat exchanger has at least one bypass valve to permit the third medium to bypass the heat exchanger. In this way, a third medium such as, for example, exhaust gas, can particularly advantageously not be directed through the heat exchanger, in particular the exhaust gas heat exchanger, but rather can be directed around it with the result that, particularly advantageously, it is possible to avoid cooling the exhaust gas.<br>
A further advantageous embodiment is characterized in that the at least one bypass valve can be activated by means of a second actuator. In this way, the bypass valve can particularly advantageously be activated by an electrical or pneumatic or hydraulic actuator.<br>
In addition it is possible to provide that the at least one bypass valve and/or the valve are arranged in, or adjacent to, the inlet diffuser. In this way, there can particularly advantageously be a saving in terms of installation space.<br>
According to the invention, in addition, a system having at least one valve as claimed in one of claims 1 to 12, and having at least one heat exchanger as claimed in one of claims 13 to 22, is proposed, which system has at least one internal combustion engine for<br><br>
' ' a vehicle and at least a first turbine of an exhaust gas turbosupercharger, wherein the valve- is arranged on the inflow side of the heat exchanger and the heat exchanger is arranged on the high pressure side of the first turbine. In this way, the at least one heat exchanger, in particular the exhaust gas heat exchanger, and the valve can particularly advantageously be arranged on the high pressure side, with the result that the recirculation of exhaust gas can particularly advantageously take place on the high pressure side.<br>
According to the invention, in addition, a further system having at least one valve as claimed in one of claims 1 to 12 and having at least one heat exchanger as claimed in one of claims 13 to 22 is proposed, said valve having at least one internal combustion engine for a vehicle and at least a first turbine of an exhaust gas turbocharger, wherein the valve is arranged on the inflow side of the heat exchanger and the heat exchanger is arranged on the low pressure side of the first turbine. In this way, the at least one heat exchanger, in particular the exhaust gas heat exchanger, and the valve can particularly advantageously be arranged on the low pressure side of the turbine, with the result that the exhaust gas can particularly advantageously be cooled on the low pressure side.<br>
Furthermore, it can particularly preferably be provided that the system has at least a second heat exchanger for cooling charge air and/or the first turbine drives a compressor for supercharging charge air. In this way, the charge air in the second heat exchanger can particularly advantageously be cooled and/or the charge air can particularly advantageously be compressed by means of the compressor.<br><br>
In addition, it is possible to provide that the system has at least a second turbine which drives at least a second compressor for supercharging charge air. In this way, the charge air and/or the recirculated exhaust gas can particularly advantageously be supercharged or compressed in two stages.<br>
Further advantageous refinements of the invention emerge from the subclaims and from the drawings. The subject matters of the subclaims relate both to the valve according to the invention for controlling an exhaust gas flow of an internal combustion engine and to the heat exchanger according to the invention for cooling the exhaust gas having at least one valve, and to the system according to the invention having at least one valve and having at least one heat exchanger.<br>

The junction between the first right parallelepiped which is located in the center and the respectively adjoining outer right parallelepiped is embodied as a round junction. In another exemplary embodiment, this junction can also be constructed in a polygonal fashion such as for example as a shoulder. In the illustrated exemplary embodiment, the first right parallelepiped and the outwardly adjoining further right parallelepipeds are embodied in one piece. In another   exemplary   embodiment,   the   respectively<br><br>
outwardly adjoining right parallelepipeds can be connected in a positively locking and/or materially joined fashion, in particular by welding, soldering, bonding etc.<br>

The heat exchanger 2, in particular the exhaust gas heat exchanger, has in its interior a number of pipes, in particular a number of flat pipes, through which the third medium, in particular the exhaust gas, flows and which are connected to an at least first base, in particular to two bases (not illustrated). The connection is positively locking, in particular by crimping or folding or chamfering and/or in a materially joined fashion, for example by welding, soldering, bonding etc. In the illustrated exemplary embodiment, the pipes (not illustrated), in particular flat pipes, are constructed from metal such as, for example, from steel, in particular from stainless steel, or from another material such as, for example, a metal with a low density such as aluminum, or from a fiber composite material or from a heat-resistant plastic. The flat pipes have a plurality of turbulence-generating elements such as, for example, winglets or other punched-out elements. These turbulence-generating elements may be produced,  for example,  in the flat<br><br>
pipes by means of a shaping fabrication method such as, for example, punching, stamping, pressing etc., or by a primary shaping fabrication method. In addition, turbulence inserts such as, for example, turbulence plates can also be provided in the flat tubes or between flat tubes.<br>
The tube plates (not denoted) are connected to the heat exchanger housing 19 by positive locking such as, for example, folding, beading, crimping etc. and/or in a materially joined fashion by, for example, welding, soldering, bonding etc. In another exemplary embodiment, the third medium, in particular the exhaust gas, flows between plates which can be stacked one on top of the other or are stacked one on top of the other. Between these plates it is possible to insert, for example, turbulence-generating elements such as turbulence plates which cause eddying of the flow and therefore lead to a better transfer of heat or a better transmission of heat. The plates can be connected to one another, for example, in a materially joined fashion by welding, soldering, bonding etc. and/or in a positively locking fashion by crimping or folding.<br>
At least one bypass valve 14 is arranged adjacent to the heat exchanger 2 and/or adjacent to the valve 1 and/or adjacent to the inlet diffuser 6.<br>
The bypass valve 14 has a valve element (not illustrated) which can be activated or is activated by means of a bypass valve actuator 15.

In the illustrated exemplary embodiment, the heat exchanger 2, in particular the exhaust gas heat exchanger, has a coolant inlet 20 in one of the outer right parallelepipeds. Cooling medium, such as for example coolant, in particular aqueous coolant, or air, can flow into the heat exchanger 2 through this cooling medium inlet 20 and can flow through this heat exchanger 2, in particular the exhaust gas heat exchanger, and in the process cool the third medium, in particular the exhaust gas. The second medium, in particular the cooling medium, in particular the aqueous cooling medium or the air, flow around the flat pipes or the plates between which the third medium, in particular the exhaust gas, flows. The second medium, in particular the cooling medium flows in at least one flow duct (not illustrated) between the heat exchanger housing 19, in particular the heat exchanger housing wall, and the flat pipes or the plates. Turbulence-generating elements such as, for example, punched-out elements, knobs, winglets or turbulence plates, which are provided improve the transfer of heat in this context. The second medium, in particular the coolant.<br><br>
leaves the heat exchanger 2, in particular the exhaust gas heat exchanger, through an outlet opening (not illustrated) which is located on the underside of the heat exchanger housing 19, which underside cannot be seen in figure 1. In the illustrated exemplary embodiment, the cooling medium exits from the outer right parallelepiped which is located adjacent to the heat exchanger outlet diffuser 21. In another exemplary embodiment, the coolant inlet 20 is arranged on any desired side of the outer right parallelepiped or of the inner right parallelepiped. Likewise, in another exemplary embodiment, the first or second medium, in particular the cooling medium, flows out at any desired location on any desired side of one of the outer right parallelepipeds or at any desired location on any desired side of the inner right parallelepiped. In the illustrated exemplary embodiment, the outflow 5 of the first medium, in particular of the cooling medium, in particular of the aqueous cooling fluid or the air, is connected to the cooling medium inlet 20 of the heat exchanger 2, in particular of the exhaust gas heat exchanger. In another exemplary embodiment, the outflow 5 is not connected to the cooling medium inlet 20. In the illustrated exemplary embodiment, the third medium, the exhaust gas, which flows through the heat exchanger 2, is cooled by the first medium Ml, in particular the cooling medium, in particular the aqueous cooling fluid or air, and after the first medium Ml flows into the plate 3 via the inflow 4 it flows through the plate 3 and leaves the plate 3 via the outflow 5, flows through the pipe and the pipe bend into the cooling medium inlet 20 of the heat exchanger 2, in particular the exhaust gas heat exchanger, flows through it and in the process cools the third medium, in particular the exhaust gas, and leaves the heat exchanger 2, in particular the exhaust gas heat exchanger, again from the cooling medium outlet (not illustrated). The cooling medium 1 can subsequently be cooled, for example, by a coolant cooler and subsequently fed back<br><br>
again to the inflow 4 of the plate 3, in particular of the cooling plate 3.<br>
Figure 2 shows an isometric sectional illustration of a coolable plate 3 of a valve 1. Identical features are provided with the same reference symbols as in figure 1.<br>
In the illustrated exemplary embodiment, the plate 3, in particular the cooling plate, is embodied from a metal, for example stainless steel or from some other steel. In another exemplary embodiment, the plate 3 can be constructed from a metal with a low density such as, for example from aluminum or from a heat-resistant plastic or from ceramic or from a fiber composite material,<br>
The plate 3 is used to cool the valve 1 and/or a bypass plate (not illustrated) and its bypass plate actuator.<br>
Plate 3 has a plate outer wall 43 which is embodied, in particular, in a circumferential fashion. In the illustrated exemplary embodiment, the plate 3 is embodied as a pentagonal plate whose corners are rounded. In another exemplary embodiment, the plate 3 has sharp corners. In another exemplary embodiment, the plate 3 has a triangular, quadrilateral or polygonal shape. In another exemplary embodiment, the plate has a polygonal and/or round and/or oval cross-sectional area.

In the illustrated exemplary embodiment, the plate outer wall 43 is embodied essentially as a frame element. In this frame, the plate 3 has a wall pairing 31 which has at least a first plate wall 32 and a further second plate wall 33. The first plate wall 32 is embodied in the illustrated exemplary embodiment as a cylinder section which has a round cross-sectional area. The second plate wall 33 is also embodied in the illustrated exemplary embodiment as a cylinder section with a circular cross-sectional area. The first plate wall 32 has a larger cross-sectional diameter than the second plate wall 33. The annular duct 30 is formed between the first plate wall 32 and the second plate wall 33. The annular duct 30 is one possible embodiment of the heat transfer duct 36. In another exemplary embodiment, the heat transfer duct 36 can be embodied as a rectangular duct or as duct with a star shape or as a duct with a combination of arcuate and rectangular sections.

The rounded corners of the plate outer wall 43 have hollow-cylindrical formations which have fastening bores 42. The fastening bores 42 can contain, for example, threads. However, they can also be formed as bores without a thread. In the illustrated exemplary embodiment, the plate 3 has four of these formations with, in each case, one fastening bore 42. In another exemplary embodiment, the plate 3 can have one to four or more than four hollow-cylindrical formations, each<br><br>
with a fastening bore 42 or with more than one fastening bore 42. Reinforcing devices 37, which are embodied as reinforcement struts or reinforcing walls, extend from the plate outer wall 43 to the heat transfer duct 36 or to the annular duct 30. A plurality of these reinforcing devices 37 intersect here, extend at different angles with respect to one another and therefore reinforce the plate 3. The reinforcing devices 37 and/or the plate outer wall 43 enclose cavities 38 which have the purpose of reducing the weight of the plate 3. These cavities 38 can be provided in the plate 3 by primary shaping fabrication methods, with which the plate 3 is manufactured, or by a material-removing fabrication method such as eroding and/or drilling and/or milling.

The aperture 41 prevents the first medium from flowing directly from the' inflow and back into the outflow 5<br><br>
again without predominantly flowing through the entirety of the heat transfer duct 36. In another exemplary embodiment, the aperture 41 can also be embodied as a continuous wall. The first medium Ml flows, after entering via the first plate opening 34 into the heat transfer duct 36 or the annular duct 30, through the heat transfer duct 36 or the annular duct and leaves it via a second plate opening 35 in order to flow out of the plate 3 again via the outflow 5.

A plurality of tube plate openings 73 are arranged in a grid shape in a plurality of rows and columns. Flat tubes (not shown) are plugged in through the tube plate openings 73 and are connected to the tube plate in a positively locking fashion by, for example, folding, beading, crimping etc. and/or in a materially joined fashion by welding, soldering, bonding etc. The third medium,  in particular exhaust gas M3,  in particular<br><br>
aqueous cooling fluid or air, flows to the bypass valve ■ element 75 in the direction of the arrow M3. The bypass valve element may assume various positions here. In a first position, the entire third medium M3 is fed through the tube plate opening 73, and the third medium M3 is not fed through the bypass opening 72. In a second position, third medium M3 is not fed through the tube plate openings 73 and the entirety of the third medium M3 is fed through the bypass opening 72.
