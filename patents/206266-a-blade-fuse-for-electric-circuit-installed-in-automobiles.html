TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a blade fuse for electric circuit installed in automobiles.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Typically, automobiles have fuses that are arranged between a battery and various electric components to protect circuits from excessive current. A prior art fuse is disclosed, for example, in U.S. patent number 4,023,264.<br>
Fig. 15 shows a prior art fuse 50. The fuse 50 includes an insulative fuse housing 54 and a fuse element 53, which is an H-like conductive plate. The fuse element 53 has two parallel flat base plates 51 and a fuse melting portion 52 that connects the two base plates 51. A terminal 51a is formed at the distal end of each base plate 51. The terminals 51a extend from the fuse housing 54, and portions of the fuse element 53 other than the terminals 51a are retained in the fuse housing 54. In other words, in Fig. 15, the terminals 51a are portions, which protrude downward from the lower end of the fuse housing 54.<br>
As shown in Fig. 16, a plurality of fuses 50 are connected to a fuse box 55. Referring to Fig. 17, the fuse box 55 has a plurality of bus bars 56 that are connected to the terminals 51a of the fuses 50. Each of the bus bars 56 is bent to define a tab 57. As shown in Fig. 18, the distal<br><br>
end of each tab 57 is bifurcated to form two opposing divided contact pieces 57a.  As shown in Fig. 18, the terminal 51a of the fuse 50 is received between the two divided contact pieces 57a so that the terminals 51a each electrically contact the corresponding tabs 57.  In this manner, the-fuse 50 is connected to the fuse box 55.<br>
The increase in the number of electric components installed in recent vehicles has increased the number of protection fuses 50, which are used in the vehicles.  The fuse box 55 must be relatively large to store many fuses. However, to improve the comfort of a vehicle, the interior of the vehicle is required to be enlarged.  The enlargement of the vehicle interior and the installation of a large fuse box 55 are contradicting concepts and it is difficult to satisfy both demands.<br>
With reference to Figs. 17 and IS, when the prior art fuse 50 is connected to the fuse box 55, the height (L) from the level of the bus bar 56 to the upper end of the fuse 50 is greater than the sum of the length (M) of the tab 57 and the height (N) of the housing 54.<br>
Since the above height (L) relates to the size of the fuse box 55, the structure of the fuse 50 hinders the<br>
production of a smaller fuse box 55.<br>
Increasing the voltage of an automobile battery is being considered -nowadays.  The prior art fuse housing 54 is made of polyethelsulfone.  However, in such a fuse housing 54, the required insulative resistance cannot be obtained when performing a fuse standard test with, for example, a 58V fuse. Accordingly, a fuse that is suitable for an<br>
increase Of the battery vol faap in t*h*=&gt; fnfurp i ^    rpnuirpd<br><br>

It is a first object of the present invention to provide a compact fuse for automobiles.  It is a second object of the present invention to provide a fuse for automobiles, which is easily assembled.  It is a third object of the present invention to provide a fuse for automobiles that is suitable to higher voltage.<br>
To achieve the above object, the present invention provides a blade fuse including a fuse element and a housing made of a insulative material for fixing the fuse element. The fuse element includes two base plates arranged along a common plane, a melting portion connecting the two base plates, a pair of opposing notches arranged on each of the two base plates, and two cover supporting portions extending continuously from the notches, respectively.

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
A fuse 1 according to a first embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to drawings.  Referring to Figs. 1 to 4, the fuse 1 includes a fuse element 2 and a housing 3, which is made of an insulative material.<br><br>
The fuse element 2 includes two base plates 4, which are arranged along a common plane, a melting portion 5, which connects the two base plates 4, two opposing notches 4c formed in each of the two base plates 4, and a cover supporting portion, which includes two triangular projections 12 that extend continuously from each of the notches 4c.  The melting portion 5 is covered by the housing 3, and the base plates 4 are fixed to the housing 3.<br>
Referring to Fig. 7, the length of the base plate 4 is substantially equal to the sum of the length (A) of the melting portion 5 in the longitudinal direction of the base plate 4, the length (B) of the notch 4c in the longitudinal direction of the base plate 4, and the length (C) of the cover supporting portion in the longitudinal direction of the base plate 4.<br>
The housing 3 is a flat: resin integral product including a hollow port ion, which accommodates the melting portion 5, and a cover (flap) 11, which is bent to close the hollow portion.  It is preferred that the housing 3 be made of a translucent resin material that is heat resistant and insulative.  Fitting portions 3a, which receive and fix the upper end of each base plate 4, are defined in the top of the housing 3. Melting portion covers 3b are defined at the laterally middle portion of the housing 3.  The melting portion covers 3b, which are opposed ro each other, define the hollow portion that accommodates the melting portion 5. Fixing surfaces 3c are defined on the two melting portion covers 3b to fix the base plates.  The distance between the two melting portion covers 3b is greater than the distance between the opposing fixing surfaces 3c.  The dimension of the top of the housing 3 in the lateral direction is slightly greater than the width of the fuse element 2 in the<br><br>
lateral direction.  Part of the base plates 4 is exposed from a cutaway portion 8, which is defined in the fixing surfaces 3c.  The cover 11 is attached to the lower end of the housing 3.  The cover 11, which is bent, is arranged between the two notches 4c of the base plates 4.<br>
The fuse element 2 is formed from an elongated sheet of fuse material plate 6 shown in Fig. 5.  It is preferred that the fuse material plate 6 be made- of a zinc (Zn) alloy conductive plate.<br>
The fuse 1 is manufactured as   described below.<br>
First, the laterally middle portion of the fuse material plate 6 is cut to form a thin portion 6a having a predetermined width in the longitudinal direct ion.<br>
Referring to Fig. 7, a unit including a plurality of fuse elements 2 is pressed out while intermittently moving the fuse material plate 6.  More specifically, the melting portions 5 corresponding to the fuse current capacity of the fuse are pressed out of the thin portion 6a, and the two base plates 4 are pressed out on each side of the melting portions 5.  Each of the base plates 4   has the notch 4c, the cover supporting portion, which includes the triangular projections 12 continuously extending from the notches 4c, and a fastening hole 4a used for crimping.<br>
Each fuse element 2 of the unit has a length that corresponds to the sum of the length (A) of the melting portion 5, the length (B) of the notch 4c, the length (c) of the cover supporting portion (c), and the length (D) of a connection portion arranged between adjacent fuse elements 2 for continuous production.  Thus, the length of the fuse<br><br>
element 2 is such that the fuse element 2 is easy to use, has high productivity, and has the minimal length required to form the desired structure.<br>
Subsequently, a fuse element 2 at the distal end of the unit is attached to the housing 3.  More specifically, the top end of the fuse element 2 and the middle portion of the base plate 4 in the longitudinal direction are inserted in the housing 3.  Referring to Fig. 4b, the base plates 4 are pressed into the space between the opposing fixing surfaces 3c.  This engages engaging projections 3d with the fastening holes 4a to fasten the fuse element 2 to the housing 3.<br>
Part of the base plate 4 is exposed from the cutaway portions 8, which is arranged in the housing 3, to come into contact with contact terminals arranged in a fuse box    (not shown).<br>
Figs. 11 and 12 show a fuse 1 of a second embodiment, and Figs. 13(a), 13(b), and 14 show a fuse 1 of a third embodiment.  The fuse 1 of the second embodiment is suitable if the corresponding contact terminal is bifurcated, and slit-like#cutaway portions 8, which define openings 10 of the base plates 4, are formed in the housing 3.  In the fuse I of the third embodiment, openings 10 of the base plates 4 are formed on two side surfaces of the fuse element 2 and the fuse 1 is suitable if a contact terminal is a tongue-like terminal that comes into contact with the two side surfaces of the fuse element 2.<br>
It is preferred that the base plate 4 be plated to provide satisfactory electric connection with the contact terminal 9.  It is preferred that at least surfaces of the<br><br>
base plate, which come into contact with the contact terminal 9, be plated.  In the fuse 1 of Fig. 1, a front surface (a first surface), a rear surface (a second surface), a right end surface, and a left end surface of the fuse element 2, which are exposed from the cutaway portions 8, are, for example, plated.  In the fuse 1 of Fig. 11, the openings 10 exposed from the slit-like cutaway portions 8 are plated.  In the fuse 1 of Fig. 13, a right end surface and a left end surface of the fuse element 2 are plated.  In the fuse 1 of the present invention, the base plate 4 , which is not used as a terminal in the prior art, serves as a contact terminal.  Thus, plating of the base plate 4, such as tin plating, is necessary.  Although the base plates 4 are plated with tin plating in the present embodiments, the base plates may be plated with copper plating or silver plating.<br>
Recent vehicles use mere electric components and larger electric components.  This has increased the amount of power used by the entire vehicle.  Accordingly, research is being conducted to increase the vehicle voltage.  For example, in a 42V system, 5 8V is required as the transient voltage (rush voltage).  When the fuse is melted by the transient voltage, a large arc is produced.  Thus, it is preferred that the housing 3 be formed from a reinforced polyamide resin, which has sufficient electric insulation and prevents the inner surfaces of the housing 3 from being damaged by an arc.  It is preferred that the reinforced polyamide resin be made by polymerizing a mixture consisting of 0.2 to 20 parts by weight of fluorine mica minerals and 100 parts by weight of a monomer for forming a polyamide resin.  It is preferred that the housing 3 be integrally formed by such a reinforced polyamide resin.<br><br>
After the fuse element 2 is inserted, the cover 11 is bent to close the hollow portion.<br>
The bending procedure for the cover 11 will now be discussed.<br>
The cover 11 is bent when the fuse element 2 is inserted in the housing 3.  More specifically, as shown in Figs. 8(a) to 8(d), when the fuse element 2 is inserted in the housing 3, a bending tool 13 is actuated after the distal end of the cover 11 passes by the distal end of the melting portion 5 and before the distal end of the cover 11 reaches the triangular projections 12.  The bending tool 13 slides into a gap defined by the triangular projections 12 and the melting portion 5 such that the cover 11 is located between the notches 4c.  The projections 12 serve to prevent the cover 11 from opening.  In this manner, the cover II is bent to close the hollow portion of the housing 3.<br>
When the fuse element 2 is completely inserted in the housing 3, the engaging projections 3d of the housing 3 are in engagement with the fastening holes 4a and outer surfaces of the housing 3 are cold-crimped.  In this manner, the fuse element 2 is fixed to the housina 3.<br>
The fuse 1 of the present invention has the following advantages.<br>
In the present invention, the fuse element 2 having the two base plates 4 and the melting portion 5 is pressed out by intermittently moving a sheet of the elongated fuse material plate 6, which includes the thin portion 6a having a predetermined width. Accordingly, the fuse 1 is manufactured efficiently.<br><br>
The fuse 1 of the present invention differs from the prior art fuses in that the opening 10, which has substantially the same size as that of the housing 3, serves as a contact terminal without projecting downward from the housing 3.  This reduces the height of the fuse 1 compared with the prior art fuse 50.<br>
Since the fuse 1 is smaller, the height of a fuse box, in which the fuses are installed, is lowered.<br>
In the fuse 1 of the present invention, the housing 3 is made of a translucent polyamide resin material.  This guarantees sufficient insulation even after the melting portion 5 is melted.  Thus, in addition to the conventional 14V generation (12V storage) system, the fuse 1 cf the present' invention may be used in a high-voltage system, such as a   42V system.<br>
Since the fuse element 2 is relatively small and the housing 3 is made of a single member, material cost of the fuse 1 is reduced.  Further, a process for assembling separate housing parts is omitted.  Thus, assembling cost and time is reduced.<br>
In the fuse 1 of the present invention, most of the terminal does not project from the lower part of the housing 3, and the height of the element, which is stored in the housing 3, is minimized.  Accordingly, the height of the fuse 1 is minimized.<br>
The melting portion 5 is accommodated in the hollow-portion of the housing 3, which is made of insulative resin. This prevents the melting portion 5, which is melted, from being diffused.<br><br>
In the fuse 1 of the present invention, the opening (terminal) 10, which is exposed from the cutaway portion 8 of the housing 3, is plated with tin. Accordingly, the fuse 1 comes into contact with the contact terminal 9 in a satisfactory state.<br>
The housing 3 is generally flat box-like translucent resin molded product and has an insertion opening, which receives the element 2, on its lower surface.  Further, the cover 11 is bent to close the hollow portion.  The melting portion cover 3b, which faces the melting portion 5, is curved outward no increase the space of the hollow portion. This efficiently absorbs energy when the melting portion 5 is melted.<br>
The cutaway portion 8 of the housing 3 guarantees that Part of the base elate contacts the contact terminal 9.<br>
