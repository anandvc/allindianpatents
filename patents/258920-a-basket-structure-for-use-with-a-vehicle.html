				<td>The present invention relates to a basket structure for use with a vehicle.<br>
[Background Art]<br>
As basket configurations for use with vehicles, configurations where the surroundings<br>
of a handlebar post of a handlebar are covered by a vehicle cover so that a basket<br>
for putting luggage into is arranged to the front of the vehicle cover are provided<br>
for practical use.<br>
Structures where a basket is arranged at the front of the handlebars of a scooter-type<br>
vehicle are well-known as this kind of vehicle basket structure (for example, refer<br>
to Japanese patent document 1 and Japanese patent document 2).<br>
[Patent Document 1] Japanese Patent Publication No. 3163454 (page 9, FIG. 3).<br>
[Patent Document 2] Japanese Patent Publication No. 3163452 (page 9, FIG.-3).<br>
FIG. 11 shows a basic configuration for a basket of the related art. For example, a vehicle basket structure 200 as shown in patent document 1 is such that a handlebar post 202 is fitted in a freely rotating manner to a head pipe 201. The circumference of the handlebar post 202 is covered by a vehicle cover 205 and a basket 206 for holding luggage is arranged to the front of the vehicle cover 205. A roll screen (roll screen assembly) 208 for covering an open surface 207 of the basket 206 is arranged, a headlight 209 is arranged at the bottom part of the basket 206, and a fitting 211 for this basket 206 is formed to the rear of and going downwards from this headlight 209. In FIG. 11, numeral 212 shows the front surface of the basket 213, numeral 213 shows the bottom of the basket 206, and numeral 214 shows a winding roll of the roll screen 208. However, with the basket structure 200 for a vehicle shown in patent document 1, a fitting section 211 for the basket 206 is formed to the rear of the headlight 209 so as to be inclined downwards to the rear. A device for making the fitting section 211 of the basket 206 difficult to see from the front or side due to using a separate cover member is therefore required. Namely, a basket structure with which the capacity for housing luggage of the basket can be increased and for which the design of the appearance is improved as a result of the basket fitting being<br>
difficult to see is therefore desired.<br>
On the other hand, with the vehicle basket structure 200 shown in patent document 2, the bottom 213 of the basket 206 inclines downwards as the rear is approached It is therefore easy for stored luggage to shift position within the basket Further, the open surface 207 of the basket 206 is formed so as to be inclined downwards in a direct ion to the front so that there is an improvement in the room provided as storage capacity of the basket. Namely, a vehicle basket structure where there is little shift in the position of stored luggage within the basket and where it is possible to substantially increase storage capacity is therefore desired [Disclosure of the Invention] [Problems to be solved by the Invention]<br>
It is therefore a first object of the present invention to provide a vehicle basket structure capable of increasing the storage capacity within the basket, making the basket fitting sections difficult to see, and improving the design of the external appearance. A second object of the present invention is to provide a vehicle basket structure where there is little shift in the position of stored luggage within the basket and the luggage capacity can be dramatically increased. [Means of Solving the Problems]<br>
A vehicle basket structure as disclosed in claim 1 to claim 4 is therefore provided in order to realize the first object The vehicle basket structure for a vehicle of claim 1 is equipped with a headlight at a front part of a vehicle and a basket provided at the upper part of this headlight, wherein a bottom section of the basket is configured to be substantially horizontal, a fitting section for fitting this basket to the vehicle cover is provided at the bottom section, swollen sections swelling further downwards than the bottom section are formed at the front of the bottom section, with the swollen sections and the upper part of the headlight being close to each other in such a manner that the fitting sections cannot be seen from the front. Increasing of the luggage storage capacity of the basket is preferable for increasing the usefulness of the basket Making the basket fitting sections difficult to see is desirable for improving the external appearance of the basket. Here, a bottom section of the basket is configured to be substantially horizontal, a fitting section for fitting this basket to the vehicle cover is provided at the bottom sect ion, swollen sections swelling further downwards than the bottom section are formed at the front part of the bottom section of the basket, and the swollen sections and the upper part of the headlight are close to each other in such a manner that the fitting sections cannot be seen from the front The luggage stored in the basket can therefore be kept<br>
substantially horizontal as a result of constructing the bottom section of the basket substantially horizontally. A fitting section for fitting the basket to the vehicle cover is provided at the bottom section, and by forming swollen sections by having the front of the bottom section swell downwards, the fitting section can be concealed from view from the front by the swollen sections and the amount of luggage that can be stored in the basket can be increased. In the invention as disclosed in claim 2, the swollen sections are formed in the shape of a reverse c as viewed in a plane It is therefore not possible to see the fitting sections from the side. In the invention of claim 3, the luggage storage capacity of the basket is increased by having the bottoms of the swollen sections gradually incline downwards towards the front and aligning downward inclination of the upper part of the headlight with this downward inclination. In the invention as disclosed in claim 4, the downward inclination of the bottomof the swollen sections starts sloping downwards gradually in a direction towards the front in the vicinity of the position of the headlight bulb as viewed from the side. As a result, there are no restrictions placed on the design of the headlight. A vehicle basket structure as disclosed in claim 5 to 9 is therefore provided in order to realize the second object. In the invention as disclosed in claim 5, a front cover covering the front part of the vehicle is fitted integrally to the basket, the basket is formed integrally of a resin material, and the front surface of the basket and the upper edge constituting the open surface of the basket are substantially at right angles as viewed from the side. This is desirable because it is then possible to store a sufficient amount of luggage in the basket, the luggage stored can be robustly supported, and effective use can be made of the vehicle basket The basket is therefore formed integrally from a resin material, and the front surface of the basket and upper edge constituting the open surface of the basket are substantially at right-angles as viewed from the side. The basket is therefore formed integrally from a resin material, and the front surface of the basket and upper edge constituting the open surface of the basket are substantially at right-angles as viewed from the side, that the height of the front surface of the basket can be increased As a result, the surface supporting the luggage stored in the basket is increased and it becomes more difficult for the luggage to topple over Further, the upper edges constituting the open surface of the basket are formed so as to be substantially at right-angles as viewed from the side The front surface of the basket therefore forms a rectangular box shape, and it is possible to increase the rigidity of the basket.<br>
In the aspect of the invention of claim 6, a metal reinforcing member is integrally formed at a prescribed range of the upper edge of the basket. As a result of forming the metal reinforcing member integrally at prescribed surroundings of the upper edge of the basket, increases in weight of the basket can be kept to a minimum, and it is possible to improve the durability of the basket.<br>
The basket of the aspect of the present invention of claim 7 and claim 8 is comprised of a bottom section, wall sections rising from this bottom section, and a netted surface section formed from a netted surface at the top of the wall sections, wherein a boundary line of the wall sections and netted surface section is inclined upwards to the rear as viewed from the side. By comprising the basket of a bottom section, wall sections rising from this bottom section, and the netted surface section formed from a net ted surface at the upper part of the wall sections, it is possible to ensure sufficient strength in the event, for example, that the bottom section of the basket is fitted to the side of the vehicle cover, and the basket can be made lightweight It is also possible to improve the design of the external appearance of the basket by having the boundary line of the wall section and the netted surface incline upwards to the rear as viewed from the side<br>
In the invention as disclosed in claim 9, an oblong through-hole is provided at the upper end of the front part of the basket.<br>
By providing the oblong through-hole at the upper part of the front surface, in the event that, for example, the roll screen etc covering the open surface of the basket is hung on the through-hole, pulling out of the roll screen is made easier [Effects of the invention]<br>
In the invention as disclosed in claim 1, as a result of configuring the bottom section of the basket in a substantially horizontal manner, it is possible to keep luggage stored in the basket in a horizontal state. As a result, the luggage load carrying ability of the basket can be improved. Further, a fitting section for fitting the basket to the vehicle cover is provided at the bottom section, and by forming swollen sections by having the front parts of the bottom section swell downwards, the fitting section is concealed from view by the swollen sections and the amount of luggage that can be stored in the basket can be increased. As a result, it is possible to improve the design of the outer appearance of the surroundings of the basket and improve the usefulness of the basket.<br>
In the invention as disclosed in claim 2, the swollen sections are formed in the shape<br>
-of a reverse c as viewed in a plane. The fitting section therefore cannot be seen from the side, and the amount of luggage that the basket can store is further increased.<br>
In the invention of claim 3, the luggage storage capacity of the basket is increased by having the bottoms of the swollen sections gradually incline downwards towards the front and aligning downward inclination of the upper part of the headlight with this downward inclination<br>
In the invention as disclosed in claim 4, limitations are not placed on the design of the headlight by having the bottom of the basket start sloping downwards gradually from the vicinity of the bulb of the headlight as viewed from the side. As a result, it is possible to ensure a degree of freedom when designing the headlight.<br>
In the invention as disclosed in claim 5, the basket is therefore formed integrally from a resin material, and the front surface of the basket and upper edge constituting the open surface of the basket are substantially at right-angles as viewed from the side, that the height of the front surface of the basket can be increased As a result, the surface supporting the luggage stored in the basket can be increased and it becomes more difficult for the luggage to topple over in the basket. As a result, the convenience of use of the basket can be improved<br>
Further, it is possible to make the front surface of the basket an angular box-shape because the basket is formed integrally of resin material and the front surface and the upper edge forming the open surface of the basket form a substantial right angle when viewed from the side. As a result, the rigidity of the basket can be improved As a result of forming the metal reinforcing member integrally at prescribed surroundings of the upper edge of the basket in the aspect of the invention as disclosed as claim 6, increases in weight of the basket can be kept to a minimum, and durability of the basket is improved. As a result, there is the advantage that the basket can be made lightweight.<br>
The aspect of the present invention of claim 7 and claim 8 has the advantage that by comprising the basket of a bottom section, wall sections rising from this bottom section, and the netted surface section formed from a netted surface at the top of the wall sections, it is possible to ensure sufficient strength in the event, for example, that the bottom section of the basket is fitted to the side of the vehicle cover, and the basket can be made lightweight. There is also the advantage that it is also possible to improve the design of the external appearance of the basket by<br>
having the boundary line of the wall section and the netted surface incline upwards to the rear as viewed from the side.<br>
The aspect of the invention as disclosed in claim 9 has the advantage that by providing the oblong through-hole at the upper part of the front surface, in the event that, for example, the roll screen etc. covering the open surface of the basket is hung on the through-hole, pulling out of the roll screen is made easier<br>

As a result, the surface supporting the luggage stored in the basket 61 can be increased and it becomes more difficult for the luggage to topple over. It is therefore possible to substantially increase the storage capacity with little shift in the position of the luggage stored in the basket 61. It is also possible to make the front part of the basket 61 an angular-shaped box by forming the basket 61 integrally of resin material and forming the front surface 76 and the upper edge 74 forming the open surface 63 of the basket 61 in such a manner as to form a substantial right angle when viewed from the side. As a result, it is possible to increase the rigidity of the basket 61 The basket structure 60 is also such that the metal reinforcing member 75 is formed at the basket 61 only at prescribed surroundings of the upper edge 74. As a resul t of this integral forming, increases in weight of the basket 61 can be kept to a minimum, and it is possible to improve the durability of the basket 61. The vehicle basket structure 60 is such that the basket 61 includes a bottom section 64, front wall section (wall section) 67 and left and right wall sections 68, 68 rising up from the bottom section 64, and a front netted section (netted surface section) 71 and left and right netted sections 72, 72 formed from net ted surfaces at the upper part of the front wall section 67 and the left and right wall sections 68, 68 (one of which is not shown). The boundary line C of the wall section 68 and the netted surface section 72 is configured so as to be inclined upwards towards the rear when viewed from the side. As a result of this, for example, in the event that the bottom section 64 of the basket 61 is fitted<br>
to the front cover 41 (side of the vehicle cover 24), it is possible to ensure sufficient fitting strength, and it is possible to make the basket lightweight Further, it is also possible to improve the external appearance of the design of the basket 61 using the rising inclination of the boundary line C In FIG 6, numeral 53 indicates a headlight bulb<br>
The motorcycle (vehicle) 10 is configured in such a manner that the handlebar post 36 is fitted in a freely rotatable manner to the head pipe 12. The handlebars 15 (refer to FIG. I) are then fitted to the handlebar post 36 and the handlebars 15 are covered by the handlebar cover 37 The surrounding of the handlebar post 36 is then covered by the vehicle cover 24.<br>
The vehicle basket structure 60 is constructed so that the basket 61 for storing the luggage is provided at the front of the vehicle cover 24 A headlight 52 is provided at the lower part of the basket 61. A plurality of fitting sections 77 for fitting the basket 61 are provided at the vehicle cover 24 to the rear of the headlight 52 in a substantially horizontal manner The front swollen section (swollen part) 65 and left and right swollen sections 66, 66 (refer to FIG. 5) are also provided for covering the surroundings of the fitting section 77 of the bottom part of the basket 61.<br>
In other words, it can be said that the vehicle basket structure 60 can be configured in such a manner that, at the motorcycle (vehicle) 10 equipped with the headlight 52 and basket 61 at the front part of the vehicle, the bottom section 64 of the basket 61 is constructed so as to be substantially horizontal, and a plurality of fitting sections 77 for fitting the basket 61 to the vehicle cover 24 (front cover 41) are provided at the bottom section 64. The fitting sections 77 are formed so as to swell to the front at the front swollen section (projection part) 65 so as to not be visible from the front<br>
For example, ensuring that the basket has sufficient luggage storage capacity is desirable for improving usefulness of the basket, and making the basket fitting sections difficult to see is desirable with regards to improving the design of the external appearance of the basket.<br>
The luggage stored in the basket is kept substantially horizontal as a result of constructing the bottom section 64 of the basket 61 substantially horizontally. As a result, improvement of the load carrying function of the basket can be achieved<br>
Further, by providing the plurality of fitting sections 77 for fitting the basket 61 to the vehicle cover 24 (front cover 41) at the bottom section 64 and forming the<br>
front swollen section (projection section ) 65 by having the front section of the bottom section 64 swell downwards, it is possible to ensure that the fitting sections 77 can not be seen froi the front using the swollen section (projection section) 65, and the luggage storage capacity of the basket 61 can be increased As a result, it is possible to improve the design of the outer appearance of the surroundings of the basket and improve the usefulness of the basket.<br>
Moreover, by forming the swollen sections in a reverse-c shape as viewed in a plane using the front swollen section 65 and left and right swollen sections 66, 66, the plurality of fitting sections 77 are not visible from the sides, and the luggage storage capacity can be further increased. The front swollen section (projection part) 65 is constructed so as to gradually slope downwards towards the front so as to be adjusted to the sloping down of the upper part of the headlight 52. This enables the luggage storage capacity of the basket 61 to be increased The bottom of the swollen section (projecting part) 65 functions so that restrictions are not imposed on the design of the headlight 52 by gradually starting inclination downwards form the vicinity of the position of the bulb 53 of the headlight 52, as viewed from the side. As a result, it is possible to ensure freedom of design of the headlight 52. Next, a description is given of a roll screen 62 covering the open surface 63 of the basket 61.
