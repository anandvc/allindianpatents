BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Figure 1 is a flow diagram of a hydrometallurgical metal extraction process according to one embodiment of the invention.<br>
Figure 2 is a flow diagram of a hydrometallurgical metal extraction process according to another embodiment of the invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The feed ore or concentrate to the process may contain one or more sulphide minerals of the base metals -<br><br>
Cu, Ni, Co and Zn, frequently combined with Fe and sometimes with other elements, such as As, Sb, and Ag.<br>
In Figure 1, reference numeral 10 genorally indicates a hydrometallurgical process according to one embodiment of the invention.  The process 10 comprises a pressure oxidation stage 12, an atmospheric leach 14, a solvent extraction 16, an evaporation stage 20 and a neutralization 22.<br>
Prior to the pressure oxidate stage 12, the copper concentrate is first subjected to a regrind to reduce the particle size to about 2% + 325 mesh.<br>
The concentrate is subjected to the pressure oxidation 12 in an autoclave in the presence of an acidic solution containing sulphate, chloride and, preferably, copper ions.<br>
The amount of acid introduced into the pressure oxidation 12 is sufficient to maintain the discharge solution from the autoclave, when operated in a continuous mode, at a pH of above 2.0, typically pH 2.3 -3.8.<br>
The chloride ion concentration in the solution in the autoclave is maintained at about 8-20 g/1, preferably about 12 g/1.<br>
The pressure oxidation 12 is carried out at a temperature of from about 115°C to about 175ºC, preferably about 130°C to about 155ºC, under a pressure of about 800 - 2200 kPa.  This is total pressure comprising oxygen pressure plus steam pressure.<br><br>
The retention time is about 0.5 - 2.5 hours and the process is normally carried out in a continuous fashion in the autoclave.  However, the process can also be carried out in a batch-wise fashion, if desired.<br>
In the pressure oxidation stage 12, all copper minerals are converted to basic copper sulphate CuSO4.2Cu{OH)2, i.e. all the copper being recovered reports to the solid phase in the pressure oxidation 12.<br>
The solids content in the autoclave is maintained at about 12-25%, i.e. 150-300 g/1 solids as determined by the heat balance and viscosity limitations.<br>
The slurry produced in the autoclave is discharged through a series of one or more flash tanks (not shown) to reduce the pressure to atmospheric pressure and the temperature to about 90-100ºC.  The liquid part of the slurry is referred to as the product solution from the pressure oxidation stage 12 and is indicated by reference numeral 21.<br>
The slurry from the flash tank(s) is filtered, as shown at 24, and the resultant filter cake is washed thoroughly to remove entrained liquor as much as possible.<br>
The solida from the pressure oxidation stage 12 after the filtration 24, are treated in the atmospheric leaching stage 14 at about pH 1.2 to pH 2.2 using raffinate from the solvent extraction 16, which is acidic, to dissolve the basic copper sulphate.  The leaching 14 takes place at a temperature of about 40 ºC for a retention time of about 15-60 minutes.  The percentage solids in the feed to the leach 14 is typically about 3-15% or about 30-170 g/1/ although it is<br><br>
possible to operate the process outside this range.  The percentage solids drops substantially during- the leach 14 as the basic copper sulphate dissolves.  Thus, the product g/1 solids may be as little as one half of the feed g/1 solids.<br>
During the atmospheric leaching stage 14, the basic copper salts dissolve almost completely with very little of the iron present in the concentrate going into solution, provided care is taken to maintain the pH in the range 1.2 to 2.2, preferably pH 1.5 to 2.0.<br>
The slurry 31 from the atmospheric loaching stage 14 is somestirnes difficult if not impossible to filter, but settles well.  In view of the need to wash the leach solids very thoroughly, the slurry 31 is pumped to a counter current decantation (CCD) wash circuit 34.  In the CCD circuit 34, the solids are fed through a series of thickeners with wash water added in the opposite direction.  By this method, the solids are ws.shed and entrained solution removed, together with the: soluble metals dissolved therein.  About 3 to 7 thickeners (not shown) are required with a wash ratio (water to solids) of about 2 to 5 to reduce entrained liquor down to less than 100 ppm dissolved Cu in the final residue.<br>
The thickener underflow from the last thickener is the final residue stream 35 at about 50% solids.  This can be treated for the recovery of precious metals, such as gold and silver, or sent to tailings.<br>
The main constituents of the stream 35 are hematite and elemental sulphur, which may also be recovered by a combination of other processes, such as flotation and leaching into a specific solvent for<br><br>
sulphur, e.g. perchloroethylene, if market conditions warrant.<br>
The thickener overflow from the fireit thickener is the product solution 33 which is fed to the solvent extraction stage 16, as shown.<br>
Copper is extracted from the product solution 33 in two stages (not shown) of extraction in the solvent extraction stage 16 to produce a raffinate 37.<br>
The raffinate 37 is split, as indicated at 38, into three streams 40, 41 and 42.  The stream 40 which comprises about 2/3 of the raffinate 37 is recycled to effect the atmospheric leach 14, as indicated above.  The actual volume of 40 is determined by the acid needs of the leach 14, to dissolve the basic copper sulphate as described, and to maintain a slight excess of acid, i.e. pH 1,5 - 2.0 which corresponds to about 1-5 g/1 HaS04, The acid requirements for stream 40 are less than the total acid contained in 37, and part of the remainder is used in the pressure oxidation 12 as an acid aource for the reactions therein.  This is supplied by stream 42. Any acid still left over from 37, not used by 40 or 42, is considered excess, and is neutralized.  This is stream 41,  Typically streams 41 and 42 are each about 1/6 of 37.  The stream 41 is subjected to the neutralization 22 with lime rock and, after liquid/solid separation 43, results in gypsum, which can be discarded, and wash water which is recycled as wash water to the CCD was.a circuit 34.<br>
The liquid 21 from the filtration 24, along with the stream 42, is subjected to the evaporation 20 to remove water and produce a more concentrated acid and<br><br>
chloride solution 44 which is recycled to the pressure oxidation 12.<br>
The evaporation of the solution prior to recycling is problematical due to the very corrosive nature thereof, i.e. high acidity (50 g/1 free acid), high chloride content (12 g/1) and high temperature in evaporation.  This precludes the use of most if not all commercially available evaporators, which are normally based on indirect heat transfer through thin metal surfaces, such as shell and tube evaporators made typically of stainless steel.  Titanium would be suitable but is too expensive if used in the large quantities which would be required for this type of application.<br>
However, the problem has been solved by direct-fired evaporation using submerged combustion of a fuel in the solution 44 and using titanium material.<br>
In order to keep the size of the evaporator down, and minimize operating and capital costs, the amount of water to be evaporated is minimized.  In order to achieve this, the copper concentration in the stream 31 is maintained at a more concentrated level, i.e. at about 30 to about 50 g/1, preferably about 35 g/1, compared with a value of 12 g/1 in the absence of evaporation.  This in turn generates a more concentrated acid stream 42 containing about 48 g/1 H2S04 instead of only 18 g/1 H2SO4. This effectively reduces the volume of the water to be evaporated by putting the same mass of acid in a smaller volume of water, thus reducing the size of the evaporator, hence justifying the use of titanium, and the fuel costs necessary to operate a direct fired evaporator.  Direct fired evaporators do not have the advantage of multiple effect of the steam generated which<br><br>
can generally reduce fuel costs in indirect evaporators, and thus justify evaporating large volume of water.<br>
With reference to Figure 2, a process 100 according to another embodiment of the invention is shown.<br>
The process 100 also comprises a pressure oxidation stage 12, atmospheric leach 14, CCD wash circuit 34,, solvent extraction 16, evaporation 20 and neutralization 22.<br>
In the process 100 some of the metal values being recovered also report to the pressure oxidation liquid 21 in addition to the solid, which solid is subjected to the atmospheric leach 14 as described with reference to Figure 1.  In Figure 2, process steps which correspond with those in Figure 1 are given like reference numerals.<br>
The liquid 21 from the filtration 24 is subjected to a copper solvent extraction 50 in order to recover copper values therefrom.<br>
It should be noted that although the step 24 is referred to as a filtration, any suitable liquid/solid separation method can be employed.<br>
The filtration 24 is the separation point between the high chloride liquid used in the pressure oxidation 12, which liquid is recycled as indicated, and a low chloride or chloride free liquid going to the atmospheric leach 14.  The filtration 24 is always accompanied by a wash with water or recycled low chloride water or a concentration of both to remove as much chloride from the solids (filter cake) as possible.  The objective ie to minimize transfer of chloride from the high chloride<br><br>
circuit to the low chloride circuit, to counteract chloride build up in the latter circuit.<br>
However, despite the washing of the siolid residue produced by the filtration 24, a small amount of about 0.1% chloride by weight typically is carried over to the atmospheric leach 14.  Thus, the chloride concentration increases in the low chloride circuit, becauue it is essentially a dead ended circuit with minimum, bleed.<br>
This problem has been overcome by recycling a stream fro:n the low chloride circuit to the high chloride circuit.  This stream is indicated by reference numeral 42 in Figure 2 to correspond with the stream 42 in Figure 1 which also comprises a recycle from the low chloride circuit to the high chloride circuit.<br>
Again the stream 42 is subjected to the evaporation 20, as described with reference to Figure 1, prior to recycle to the pressure oxidation 12.  However, in this case, there is no need to recycle acid from the low chloride circuit because enough acid is generated by the copper solvent extraction 50 in the form of raffinate 63.  In fact, it is usually necessary to neutralize some of the acid in the raffinate 63, as indicated at 64 prior to recycling the raffinate 63.  As indicated at 65, the neutralization product is subject to a liquid/solid<br>
separation step to produce solid gypsum which can be<br>
which is subjected to the<br>
evaporation 20 before recycle.<br>
Since there is no need to recycle acid from the low chloride circuit, the raffinate 37 from the solvent extraction 16 is split into only two streams, i.e. 2/3 into stream 40 which is used in the atmospheric leach 14, and 1/3 into stream 41 which is subjected to the<br><br>
neutralisation 22 and liquid/solid separation 43 to produce solid gypsum which can be discarded and a stream 45 which is split, as indicated at 46 into a stream which is recycled as wash water to the CCD circuit 34 and stream 42 which goea to the evaporation 20 for recycle to the pressure oxidation 12,  This serves to arecycle chloride from the low chloride circuit back to the high chloride circuit.<br>
