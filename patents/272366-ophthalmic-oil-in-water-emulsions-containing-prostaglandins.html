				<td>Ophthalmic oil-in-water emulsions containing prostaglandins<br>
Description<br>
The present invention refers to an oif-in-water emuision comprising at least<br>
one prostaglandin as active agent and a surfactant component comprising a<br>
combination of at least two non-ionic surfactants. The emulsion is suitable<br>
for ophthalmic applications, particularly for the treatment of glaucoma and/or<br>
ocular hypertension, and has an increased chemical stability of the<br>
prostaglandin active agent so to allow long-term storage, e.g. at room<br>
temperature.<br>
Prostaglandins are chemical moieties, found in tissues or organs of humans,<br>
exhibiting a wide range of physiological activities. Some prostaglandin<br>
synthetic F 2a analogues have been known to be useful as ophthalmic<br>
phannaceutical agents, specifically as ocular hypotensive antigiaucoma<br>
agents. For example latanoprost, travoprost, bimatoprost and unoprostone<br>
have been introduced in the market under the trade marks respectively of<br>
Xalatan, Travatan, Lumigan and Rescula as ophthalmic eye drop solutions<br>
for the treatment of ocular hypertension and glaucoma.<br>
Problems associated with these prostaglandin analogues are their rather<br>
poor water solubility and their chemical instability especially in aqueous<br>
solutions. Consequently many different ophthalmic formulations have been<br>
proposed to overcome such problems.<br>
EP-A-0 435 682 describes the use of inclusion complexes of prostaglandins<br>
with cydodextrins which are water soluble complexing agents with an<br>
hydrophobic cavity, wherein hydrophobic drugs such as prostaglandins are<br>
hosted inside this cavity leading to higher water solubility and higher stability<br>
in water.<br>
The stability and clinical efficacy of a latanoprost ophthalmic formulation<br>
containing cyclodextrin was shown in The Journal of Clinical Phamiacoiogy,<br>
47, 121-126,2007.<br>
The use of modifiecl cyclodextrins (i.e. etherised cyctodextrins) to complex<br>
and stabUize prostaglandins is proposed in EPA-0 330 511.<br>
The stabilization of the aqueous ophthalmic solution of latanoprost by<br>
adjusting the pH of the solution to a value in the range 5 - 6.25 or by the<br>
addition of e-aminocaproic acid has been described in EP-A-1 532 981.<br>
Solubility and stability of prostaglandins are also improved also by the<br>
addition of polyethoxylated castor oil to the aqueous solution<br>
(US 5.849,792).<br>
An ophthalmic fonnuiation of prostaglandins is proposed In US 2004/076678:<br>
acrylate, cellulose or other polymers are added to the aqueous solution of<br>
prostaglandins to prolong the efficacy when administered to the eyes.<br>
An example of an ophthalmic emulsion is given in US 3,608,073 covering a<br>
formulation containing pilocarpine, an oil, an aqueous phase and an<br>
interface agent.<br>
EP-A-0 521 799 teaches the preparation of submicron ophthalmic emulsions<br>
using an oil. an amphoteric surfactant and a phospholipid.<br>
Oil, aqueous phase, phospholipid are the components subjected to high<br>
pressure homogenization to generate submicron emulsions containing<br>
flurbiprofen for opthalmic application (US 5171566).<br>
The addition of hydrophobic suspending particles to stabilize submicron<br>
emulsions is suggested in US 2003/15471.<br>
A microemulsion, obtained by high pressure homogenisation, of latanoprost<br>
<br>
is described in Int. J. Pharm., 305, 176-179. 2005: Stabilization is obtained<br>
by the use of polyvinylalcohol as emutsifier.<br>
Benzalkonium chloride is one of most used antimicrobial preservatives for<br>
ophthalmic formulations but it has been also widely used in the formation of<br>
ophthalmic microemulsions (US 5.698,219) thanks to its positive charge<br>
which stabilizes the droplets; this positive charge can be provided also by<br>
other cationic agents (WO 2006/050838).<br>
The use of positively charged microemulsions for the administration of<br>
prostaglandins is described in WO 2006/050836 or WO 2007/042262: the<br>
interface film Is formed by the combination of a non-ionic surfactant and a<br>
cationic agent such as quatemary ammonium compounds (including<br>
benzalkonium chloride), amino alcohols, biguanide salts. The resulting<br>
emulsions have a zeta potential of at least 16 mV.<br>
However the use of cationic agents for ophthalmic use must be carefully<br>
checked in order to guarantee ocular tolerability (Eur.J.Pharm.Biopharm., 53,<br>
263-280. 2002).<br>
A combination of benzalkonium chloride with specific number of carbon<br>
atoms, a surfactant, a tonicity agent is described in EP-A-1 547 599<br>
describing a stable latanoprost ophthalmic solution.<br>
EP-A-0 458 588 discloses an ocuto-hypotensively synergistic combination of<br>
a 13.14-dihydro-15-keto-20-C1-6 alkyl prostaglandin and a potyoxyethyiene<br>
sorbitan unsaturated C10-C24 aliphatic acid monoester for the manufacture of<br>
a medicament useful in the treatment of ocular hypertension.<br>
EP-A-1 655 021 discloses an oil-in-water emulsion useful as a delivery<br>
vehicle of hydrophobic ingredients such as pharmaceutical drugs, wherein<br>
the emulsion particles have a net positive charge and comprise a cationic<br>
agent.<br>
<br>
EP-A-1 681 059 describes a pharmnaceutical composition comprising an oii-<br>
in-water emulsion containing a prostaglandin F2a derivative, an oil. a water-<br>
soluble polymer and water. The water-soluble polymer may be a polyvinyl<br>
compound, a water-soluble cellulose compound or a polysaccharide. The oil<br>
may e.g. be an animal or vegetable oil and/or medium chain fatty add<br>
triglyceride.<br>
US 2006/0182781 describes an ophthalmic microparticle composition,<br>
wherein the microparticles comprise a polymer matrix and an active<br>
ingredient, e.g. a prostaglandin.<br>
WO 2004/082625 and US 2007/0036829 describe self-emulsifying<br>
ophthalmic compositions comprising oil globules dispersed in an aqueous<br>
phase, wherein the globules comprise a surfactant component and a polar<br>
oil component. The oil component is present in an amount of up to 1.25% (w/<br>
w) of the total emulsion.<br>
US patent 5,827,835 descrit)es a non-toxic emulsion composition comprising<br>
a non-ionic cellulose ether having a molecular weight of at least 30 kD, an<br>
oil, water and optionally an emulsifying agent. The emulsion may further<br>
comprise pharmaceutical drugs such as prostaglandins.<br>
WO 02/064166 described a composition comprising at least one<br>
monoglyceride, at least one emulsifier, an aqueous solution and at least one<br>
organic solvent.<br>
KR 2003/0046553 discloses a temperature-sensitive emulsion composition<br>
for external use comprising a prostaglandin E1 as an active ingredient. The<br>
composition is applied to the skin and forms a gel at body temperature. The<br>
formation of a gel, however, is undesirable for ocular applications.<br>
It has been now been unexpectedly found that a combination of an oily<br>
phase containing a prostaglandin active agent, an aqueous phase, a<br>
<br>
surfactant component comprising a combination of at least two non-ionic<br>
surfactants can spontaneously generate stable sub-micron emulsions for<br>
ophthalmic use. These emulsions preferably have a substantially neutral<br>
electrochemical charge (zeta potential) and have excellent stability<br>
characteristics both in terms of physical properties of the micro-emulsion and<br>
the chemical stability of the prostaglandin active agent. The emulsions may<br>
be prepared by simply mixing the components, whereby spontaneous micro-<br>
emulsification occurs. It is not necessary to apply high energy processes<br>
such as high pressure homogenisation and/or sonication. This contributes<br>
further to the stability of the system.<br>
Thus, the subject-matter of the present invention is an oil-in-water emulsion<br>
having a substantially neutral zeta potential for ophthalmic application<br>
comprising as components<br>
(i) a dispersed oily phase,<br>
(ii) at least one prostaglandin as active agent, which is dissolved in the oily<br>
phase component (i),<br>

surfactants, and<br>
(iv) a contiguous aqueous phase, optionally comprising formulation agents.<br>
The emulsion of the present invention is suitable for use as a pharmaceutical<br>
formulation, particularly as an ophthalmic formulation. Preferably, the oil-in-<br>
water emulsion is used for the prevention, alleviation and/or treatment of<br>
ocular diseases such as glaucoma and/or ocular hypertension. The emulsion<br>
is suitable for single-dose applications or multiple-dose applications.<br>
The emulsions of the present invention are characterized by a high chemical<br>
stability as measured by determination of the active ingredient recovery after<br>
extended storage time, e.g. by HPLC. The recovery of the active ingredient<br>
after storage at 25oC for 6 months, more preferably 9 months and most<br>
preferably 12 months is at least 80%, more preferably at least 90% and most<br>

surfactants, anionic surfactants, short-chain, e.g. C1-4 monohydric alcohols,<br>
fatty acids, e.g. C4-8 fatty acids or from the class of lecithins or/and<br>
<br>
phospholipids. Such compounds may present problems of eye compatibility<br>
or physical/chemlcai instability.<br>
The emulsion may, however, comprise other agents commonly used in<br>
ophthalmic formulations, e.g. buffer agents such as phosphate salts, citrate<br>
salts etc., isotonic agents such as glycerol, sorbitol, glucose, sodium chloride<br>
etc., viscosity-increasing compounds such as hydroxypropylcellulose or<br>
other water-soluble cellulose derivatives, polymethylmethacrylate or other<br>
poiyacryiic add derivatives, chitosan, hyaluronic acid, poiyvinytpyrrolidone<br>
etc., antimicrobial preservatives, particulariy chlorobutanol, antioxidants or<br>
stabilizers. The emulsion may comprise the prostaglandin as the only active<br>
agents. In different embodiments, the emulsion may comprise one or more<br>
further active agents, particulariy hydrophilic active agents which are<br>
preferably present in the aqueous phase.<br>
Preferred examples of further active agents are as follows:<br>

The aqueous phase (iv) of the emulsion is preferably a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable aqueous phase, which is preferably selected from the group<br>
consisting of sterilized water, purified water or any other type of water<br>
suitable for ophthalmic application. The aqueous phase is preferably present<br>
in an amount of 30-95% (w/w), more preferably in an amount of 50-95% (w/<br>
w) based on the total weight of the emulsion. The amount of the aqueous<br>

based on the total weight of the emulsion.<br>
The above-described components, when mixed, spontaneously generate<br>
stable sub-micron emulsions without the need of high energy shear<br>
procedures. For example, the emulsions may be prepared by a method<br>
comprising the steps:<br>
(a) optionally solubilising formulation agents in the aqueous phase,<br>
(b) solubilising the first non-ionic surfactant either in the aqueous or oily<br>
phase,<br>
(c) solut&gt;iiising the second non-ionic surfactant either in the aqueous or oily<br>
phase,<br>
(d) solubilising the prostaglandin active agent in the oily phase, and<br>
(e) mixing the oily phase with the aqueous phase.<br>
The mixing step is preferably canied out with standard mixing procedures,<br>
e.g. using paddle mixers, magnetic stirres, homogenizers etc. The use of<br>
high energy mixing procedures such as high pressure homogenisation or<br>
sonication can be avoided, However, it is possible to use high energy mixing<br>
procedures such as high pressure homogenisation or sonication.<br>
For pharmaceutical purposes, the emulsion is preferably prepared using<br>
sterile components and devices. All steps of the manufacturing process are<br>
preferably performed under aseptic conditions and the final formulations are<br>
tested following the official pharmacopeial requirements. If the emulsion is<br>
formulated as a multiple-dose preparation, an antimicrobial preservative<br>
such as chlorobutanol is added.<br>
The invention is further described by the following examples, which should in<br>
no way be considered as limiting.<br>

EXAMPLE 9<br>
CHARACTERiZATiON TESTS<br>
The o/w submicron emulsions prepared as described in the above examples<br>
were characterized from a physico-chemical point of view (the size and the<br>
electrochemical charge of the sub-micron emulsions, the chemical stability of<br>
prostaglandin at different storage conditions, the antimicrobial efficacy). The<br>
resulting data are reported here as shown in the following paragraphs and<br>
tables.<br>
9.1 Size and electrochemical charge determination of the droplets of<br>
the submicron emulsions of the invention<br>
The size and electrochemical charge (zeta potential) of the droplets of the<br>
submicron emulsions prepared as shown in the Examples 1-8 and<br>
Comparative Example A were detemnined by Dynamic Laser Light Scattering<br>
(Malvem Instalments. Zetasizer Nano ZS).<br>
Zeta potential measuremente were carried out with the Zetasizer NanoZS of<br>
the Malvem Instruments Ltd (UK). The sample (0.75 ml) to be analyzed was<br>
placed, by usir^g a syringe to avoid bubbles, in a folded capillary cell fitted<br>
with electrodes. The cell was inserted in the instrument and the<br>
measurement sequence was started automatically; all the individual<br>
measurement runs were accumulated together and then summed to give the<br>
final Zeta potential result. It was not necessary to dilute the samples for the<br>
analysis and consequently there was no risk to artificially change the<br>
characteristics of the sample.<br>
The data are reported in Table 1.<br>
Table 1: Droplest size and Zeta potential of the submicron emulsions<br>
of the invention<br>
All the formulations prepared resulted to be homogeneous fluid dispersions,<br>
with no separation of phases or formation of visible large droplets. Actually<br>
the data reported in Table 1 confirm the formation of sub-micron emulsions<br>
with droplets size at least below 700 nm; the electrochemical charge (zeta<br>
potential) values were all approximately equal to 0, indicating an almost<br>
neutral charge as a result of the use of non-Ionic surfactants as interface<br>
agents.<br>
9.2 Chemical Stability studies of Latanoprost<br>
Stability studies at the storage conditions of 45°C, 25°C and 4°C were<br>
carried out on the Latanoprost submicron emulsion of Example 1.<br>
The sample was preserved in a glass container and a commercial<br>
Latanaprost ophthalmic aqueous solution (Xalatan*) was used as the<br>
reference product. At 45°C the submicron emulsion of Example 1 was<br>
placed not only in a glass vial but also in two types of plastic bothes.<br>
The Xaiatan* formulation is a simple buffered isotonic aqueous solution<br>
made of the following components:<br>
Latanoprost (0.005 g in 100 ml)<br>
Sodium Chloride<br>
Sodium Phosphate monobasic<br>
Sodium Phosphate dibasic<br>
Benzalkonium chloride<br>
Water for injectables<br>
This composition is totally different from the microemulsion of the present<br>
invention: there is no oil component such as ethyl oleate and there is a<br>
strong cationic preservative such as benzylalkonium chloride, whereas the<br>
present formulations only comprise non-ionic surfactants such as Tween 80<br>
and Tween 20.<br>
Latanoprost content was determined with an HPLC (Agilent series 1100)<br>
equipped with an UV detector and using a mixture of two mobile phases.<br>
The data reported in the following Tables 2a, 2b, 2c are expressed as<br>
Latanoprost concentration per mi of liquid formulation.<br>
Table 2a: Stability studies at 4°C<br>
Notes: a. all the latanoprost concentration data are expressed in µg/ml<br>
b. bottle 1 is made of polyethylene<br>
c. bottte 2 is made of low density polyethylene<br>
The data reported prove a dearly higher stability of the sub-micron emulsion<br>
of the invention in comparison to the marketed aqueous solution Xalatan*. It<br>
is particularly interesting to stress the very good stability at 25°C, which can<br>
lead to room temperature storage indications avoiding the necessity of low<br>
temperature conditions. Furthermore, the data In Table 2c at 45°C show that<br>
the microemulsion of the invention is very much more stable than Xalatan*<br>
both in glass vial and in plastic containers.<br>
Thus, it was found that the formulation of Example 1 remained fluid and<br>
homogeneous, with no separation of phases, at all tested conditions.<br>
The potential influence of the oil/water ratio of the sub-micron emulsion on<br>
the chemical stability of the prostaglandin was studied by comparing the<br>
stabHity of the sutMnicron emulsion of the invention (Example 1) wnth the<br>
sub-mioon emulsion of referem^ of example a, which differs only for a more<br>
diluted oil In water ratio.<br>
Latanoprost concentrations are determined with the HPLC method described<br>
before.<br>
Table 3: Stability studies at 25°C of submieron emulsion with diffierent<br>
o/w ratios<br>
The data reported in Table 3 clearly show that the sub-micron emulsion with<br>
higher oil/water ratio (Example 1, o/w ratio 1/ 20) is more stable than the one<br>
with lower oil/water ratio (Comparative Example A, o/w ratio 1/40).<br>
9.3 Physico-chemical stability of tits sub-micron emulsions<br>
The formulations of the invention stored at different temperatures were also<br>
characterized in terms of the size of the droplets by Laser Light Scattering<br>
(Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS). Data are reported in Table 4.<br>
As dearly evidentiated by the data in Table 4, the prostaglandin ophthalmic<br>
formulations of the invention maintained the sub-micron size of the droplets<br>
also at prolonged times at high temperature.<br>
9.4 Antlmicrobiai efficacy of the sub-micron emulsion<br>
In the case of ophthalmic formulations it is mandatory to prove the<br>
antimiorobial efficacy of the preparation, showing that during storage and<br>
use of the formulation microbial contamination is prevented.<br>
Consequently we introduced in the aqueous phase of the sub-microemulsion<br>
the mild non-irritant preservative chlorobutanoi (Example 4). This formulation<br>
was tested following the requirements of the Italian Pharmacopeia (11th<br>
edition, pp 533-534,2002), which is in line with the European Pharmacopeia.<br>
This official test is based on the inoculation into the formulation under<br>
examination of controlled concentrations of two species of bacteria<br>
(Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylicoccus aureus) and one spedes of<br>
fungi (Candida albicans). At predetermined times up to one month adequate<br>
sample of inoculated formulations were analyzed in terms of live micro-<br>
organisms. Data are reported in the following Table 5.<br>
<br>
TABLE 5: Logarithmic reduction of number of micro-organisms<br>
inoculated into formulation of example 4<br>
Micro-organism<br>
The data reported in Table 5 show a very good antimicrobial efficacy of the<br>
sub-microemuision tested. Actually the offcial criteria of acceptance A are<br>
satisfied.<br>
Further, it was found that a formulation of the invention (Example 4)<br>
containing chlorobutanol as preservative is stable even after long-term<br>
storage at high temperatures.<br>
TABLE 6: Stability studies of latanoprost microemuision of Example 4<br>
stored in glass vial<br>
The stability was tested as described under Section 9.2 by an HPLC<br>
analytical procedure.<br>
EXAMPLE 10<br>
DETERMINATION OF OCULAR IRRITATION POTENTIAL<br>
An o/w microemulsion of the invention (without latanoprost) was tested with<br>
regard to its eye inritation potential using the SkinEthic Reconstituted Human<br>
Corneal Epitheliai (RHCE) model (Nguyen D. H., Beuerman R. W., De<br>
Wever B. and Rosdy M. Three-dimensional construct of the human corneal<br>
epithelium for in vitro toxicology. In: H. Salem and S. A. Katz, Editors,<br>
Aitemative Toxicological Methods, CRC Press (2003). pp. 147-159). The<br>
principle of the assay is based on the measurement of cycotoxicity in<br>
recortstituted human corneal epithelium cultures after topical exposure to the<br>
test material by means of the colourimetric MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-<br>
yl]-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazoiiumbromide) reduction assay.<br>
The test material was classified based on MTT viability analysis according to<br>
the following prediction model after a 60-minute exposure period and 16-<br>
hour post exposure incubation period:<br>
i) The test material was considered to be non-irritant to the eye if the tissue<br>
viability was &gt;50%.<br>
ii) The test material was considered to be irritant to the eye if the tissue<br>
viability was =0%.<br>
Compared to the negative control tissues, the MTT relative viability of the<br>
test material treated tissues after a 60-minute exposure period and a 16-<br>
hour post exposure Incubation period was 104.3%.<br>
in conclusion, under the conditions of the test, the test material was<br>
considered to be non-irritant.<br>
<br>
EXAMPLE 11<br>
IN VIVO TEST<br>
An o/w microemulsion of the invention (without latanoprost) was tested with<br>
regard to its eye initation potential in an in vivo rabbit test model. The test<br>
was performed on 3 New Zealand White Rabbits, in a single application, 0.1<br>
ml of the microemulsion was applied with readings taken 1, 2 and 3 days<br>
thereafter. The test method was according to ISO 10993-1: 2003, ISO<br>
10993-10: 2002 and ISO 10993-12: 2007. The mean value of eye inritation<br>
scores are shown in Table 7.<br>
TABLE 7<br>
It can be stated that the microemulsion produced slightly irritating effects<br>
after the application, whidi were fully reversible within 24 hours post<br>
instillation. Based on these results, the microemulsion is considered to be a<br>
non-eye-irritant.<br>
