INK-JET AUTHENTICATION MARK FOR A PRODUCT OR PRODUCT<br>
PACKAGING<br>
Technical field<br>
[0001] The invention relates to an authentication mark for application utilizing ink-jet printing to a product or product packaging that allows at least partial determination whether the product or product packaging is authentic.<br>
Background art<br>
Authentication marks are used in product packaging to protect the brand identity. Brand identity plays an important role in the marketplace. It provides a means for consumers to identify and rely on products coming from a particular source. It also provides a means for companies to attract and build goodwill with customers, thereby encouraging repeat business. Companies therefore spend billions of dollars on advertising and product development to establish such brand identity.<br>
Authentication marks are also used in security documents, for example, in identification cards, driver licenses and bankcards. A security document normally combines a number of security features. Usually the number of security features increases with the risk and the consequences if a fake security document would be used. Additional security features are often applied by introduction of complex processes. In US 20040219287 (UCB), parades tagged with a DNA strand are used for labelling an article for security, identification and/or authentication purposes. Frequently, it is required that the label on a product packaging or the security document contains unique information, e.g. a product serial number respectively personal information such as name, address and a passport photograph. Ink-jet printing has proven to be a very suitable technique to print variable information and images to a security document or a label of a product packaging.     US 20020105569 (HP) discloses an ink-jet printing system to create a security document using different ink types. The secure document is based on a pigment type ink printed upon a porous ink receiver to form an opaque layer, that can be removed by use of mild abrasion so as to reveal<br><br>
a secure message printed eariier with a dye penetrant ink on the porous ink receiver.<br>
Pigmented inks are also used in US 2005042396 (DIGtMARC) to assemble identification cards.<br>
US 20030194532 (3M) discloses the manufacture of secure ID badges by using ink-jet printing in an image retaining laminate assembly comprising; a first substrate comprising a first surface and one or more projections extending beyond the first surface, the projections defining a second surface of the first substrate, and a second substrate overiaying the second surface of the first substrate.<br>
In US 6837959 (AGFA) ink-jet printing is used to manufacture identification cards containing a waternark revealed by partial impregnation of a UV-curable lacquer into a porous opaque ink-receiving layer,<br>
US 2004262909 (GIESECKE &amp; DEVRIENT) discloses a method for individualizing security documents comprising the steps of: providing a document having a first, high security quality printed image (1) comprising mutually contrasting light and dark areas (la, lb), and printing at least part of the first printed image (1) with a second printed image (2), characterized in that the material selected for printing the second printed image (2) is a materia! that is repelled either by the dark areas (lb) or by the light areas (la) of the first printed image (1) and is deposited in the accordingly other areas (1 a or 1b) so that it remains only in said other areas. There have been many attempts to provide security features that are tamperproof or cannot be falsified. However, it has been the experience that after a certain period of time the counterfeiters catch up with the technology used by the Industry. There is therefore a constant need to provide novel security features, which are not easy to duplicate, but using simple processes for their application to a product or product packaging. Objects of the invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a simple method for the application to a product or product packaging of novel authentication marks.<br><br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a product or product packaging having authentication marks, which are not easy to duplicate. Further objects of the invention will become apparent from the description hereinafter. Summary of the invention<br>
It has been surprisingly found that authentication marks could be obtained by jetting and curing a curable fluid on an ink-receiving layer according to a first image and then printing a second image overlapping partially with the first image. j  Objects of the present invention have been realized with a method of ink-jet printing an authentication mark on an article comprising in order the steps of:<br>
a)	providing an article comprising an ink-receiving layer;<br>
b)	applying a curable fluid on an ink-receiving layer according to a first image;<br>
c)	at least partially curing said curable fluid; and<br>
d)	jetting at least one ink-jet ink on said ink-receiving layer according to a second image partially overlapping with said first image.<br>

Ink receiver<br>
The ink receiver used in the ink-jet printing method according to the present Invention comprises a support with at least one ink-receiving layer. The ink-receiving layer may consist of just one single layer, or alternatively it may be composed of two or more layers. The ink-receiving layer or at least one of the ink-receiving layers, in the case of multiple layers, contains at least a polymeric binder and a curable compound. The ink-receiving layer or at least one of the ink-receiving layers, in the case of multiple layers, preferably further contains also at least one filler. The ink-receiving layer can be transparent but is preferably translucent or opaque.<br>
The ink-receiving layer used in the ink-jet printing method according to the present invention may be a coloured layer, for example, to give a specific background colour to an identification card.<br><br>
The ink-receiving layer, and an optional auxiliary layer, such as a backing layer for anti-curl and/or adhesive purposes, may further contain well-known conventional ingredients, such as surfactants serving as coating aids, cross-linking agents, plasticizers, cationic substances acting as mordant, light-stabilizers, pH adjusters, anti-static agents, biocides, lubricants, whitening agents and matting agents. In case of a label, the backside of the support is preferably provided with an adhesive backing layer or the support is chosen in such a way (e.g. a polyethylene support) that the label can be thermally laminated onto a substrate such as paper and cartons.<br>
The ink-receiving layer and the optional auxiliary layer(s) may also be cross-linked to a certain degree to provide such desired features as waterfastness and non-blocking characteristics. The cross-linking is also useful in providing abrasion resistance and resistance to the formation of fingerprints on the element as a result of handling. The dry thickness of the ink-receiving layer or the ink-receiving layers, in the case of multiple layers, is preferably at least 5 pm, more preferably at least at 10 pm and most preferably at least 15 m.

Other examples of useful high-quality polymeric supports for the present invention include opaque white polyesters and extrusion blends of polyethylene terephthalate and polypropylene.<br><br>
Polyester film supports and especially poly(ethylene terephthalate) are preferred because of their excellent properties of dimensional stability. When such a polyester is used as the support material, a subbing layer may be employed to improve the bonding of the ink-receiving layer to the support. Useful subbing layers for this purpose are well known in the photographic art and include, for example, polymers of vinylidene chloride such as vinylidene chloride/acrylonitrile/acrylic acid terpolymers or vinylidene chloride/methyl acrylate/itaconic acid terpolymers. Polyolefins are prefenred supports for thermal lamination onto a substrate, which is preferably a polyolefin-coated substrate, such as polyolefin-coated paper or carton.<br>
The support of the ink receivers used in the ink-jet printing method according to the present invention may also be made from an inorganic material, such as a metal oxide or a metal (e.g. aluminium and steel). The support of the Ink receivers used in the ink-jet printing method according to the present invention preferably consists of the product itself or the product packaging to be foreseen with authentication marks. In one embodiment the support of the ink receivers used in the ink-jet printing method according to the present invention is a transparent support. It was found that authentication marks could be created with dye based ink-jet inks exhibiting a higher optical density of the main image in the uncured areas than in the cured areas, i.e. the security image, when looked at in reflection. But when one looks from the backside, i.e. through the transparent support, the main image exhibited a lower optical density than the security image. Such authentication marks can be advantageously used in security badges and identification cards.<br>
Polymeric binders<br>
[0059]  The ink-receiving layer used in the ink-jet printing method of the present<br>
invention, as polymeric binder preferably contains a poiyvinylalcohol (PVA) i.e. polyvinyl alcohol, a vinylalcohol copolymer or modified polyvinyl alcohol. The polyvinyl alcohol is preferably a cationic type polyvinyl alcohol, such as the cationic polyvinyl alcohol grades from KURARAY,<br><br>

The filler in the ink-receiving layer used in the ink-jet printing method of the present invention, can be a polymeric particle but is preferably an inorganic filler, which can be chosen from neutral, anionic and cationic filler types. Useful fillers include e.g. silica, talc, clay, hydrotalcite. kaolin, diatomaceous earth, calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, basic magnesium carbonate, aluminosilicate, aluminum trihydroxide, aluminum oxide (alumina), titanium oxide, zinc oxide, barium sulfate, calcium sulfate, zinc sulfide, satin white, alumina hydrate such as boehmite, zirconium oxide or mixed oxides.<br>
Suitable polymeric particles include polystyrene and styrene-acrylic copolymer particles having a 0.5pm particle diameter and a 0.1pm shell In one embodiment the filler acts as an opacifier rendering the ink-receiving layer non-transparent.<br><br>
In another embodiment the filler has magnetic properties which can be used to introduce additional security features.<br>
The ratio of filler to polymeric binder is preferably between 20/1 and 3/1 for preparing an ink-receiving layer with a high porosity, a so-called micro-porous or a macro-porous ink-receiving layer. Curable fluid<br>

Preferably the curable fluid is jetted on the ink-receiving layer by Inkjet printing.<br>
The curable fluid is jetted on the ink-receiving layer according to a first image, the so-called "security image". The ink-receiving layer and the curable fluid are then at least partially cured by an exposure to actinic radiation, thermal curing or by electron beam curing. After curing, at least one ink-jet ink is jetted on the ink-receiving layer according to a second image, the so-called "main image". An authentication mark is created when the main image partially overlaps with the security image. In a preferred embodiment, after curing, at least two ink-jet inks are jetted on the ink-receiving layer and more preferably three colour inks are jetted to form the "main image". The three colour inks are part of an Inkjet ink set comprising cyan, magenta and yellow inks. The inkjet ink set is preferably an aqueous dye or pigment based inkjet ink set. In a preferred embodiment the at least partially curing is performed by overall curing, i.e. the complete security image is cured. In another preferred embodiment the overall curing includes full curing instead of partial curing of all curable compounds.<br>
The curable fluid for use in the ink-jet printing method according to the present invention contains a curable compound. Any monomer or oligomer may be used as the curable compound. A combination of monomers, oligomers and/or prepolymers is preferably used in the curable fluid. The monomers, oligomers and/or prepolymers may possess different degrees<br><br>
of functionality, and a mixture including combinations of mono-, di-, tri-and higher functionality monomers, oligomers and/or prepolymers may be used.<br>
The curable fluid for use in the ink-jet printing method according to the present invention preferably further contains an initiator. If the curable fluid consists of a curable compound or a mixture of curable compounds, then preferably an initiator is present in the ink-receiving layer. The curable fluid may contain a polymerization inhibitor to restrain polymerization by heat or actinic radiation actinic radiation during storage. The curable fluid preferably further contains at least one surfactant. The curable fluid may further contain at least one solvent. The curable fluid may further contain at least one biocide. The curable fluid may be a curable ink-jet ink containing a colorant or a white pigment such as titanium oxide, although preferably the curable fluid is a clear fluid. Instead of only one curable Ink-jet ink. curable ink-jet ink sets comprising 3 or more curable ink-jet inks may be used to obtain a security image consisting of different colours. Preferred curable ink-jet ink sets comprise cyan, magenta and yellow curable ink-jet ink. A black curable ink-jet ink or other colour curable ink-jet inks (red, green, blue,...) may be added. The curable ink-jet ink set can also be a multi-density ink-jet ink set comprising at least one combination of curable ink-jet inks with about the same hue but different chroma and lightness. The curable ink-jet ink may further contain at least one polymeric dispersant in order to obtain a stable dispersion of a pigment in the ink-jet ink. Curable compounds<br>
Any monomer or oligomer may be used as the curable compound in the curable fluid used in the ink-jet printing method according to the present invention. However if the ink-receiving layer is hydrophilic preferably a water-soluble or a water-dispersable monomer is used. A combination of monomers, oligomers and/or prepolymers may also be used. The monomers, oligomers and/or prepolymers may possess different degrees of functionality, and a mixture including combinations of<br><br>
mono-, di-, tri-and higher functionality monomers, oligomers and/or prepolymers may be used.<br>
The curable compound(s) used in the ink-jet printing method according to the present invention can be any monomer and/or oligomer found in Polymer Handbook. Vol. 1 + 2.4thth edition. Edited by J. BRANDRUP, at al, Wiley-lnterscience , 1999.<br>
Suitable examples of monomers include: acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, maleic acid (or their salts), maleic ahhydride; alkyl(meth)acrylates (linear, branched and cycloalkyi) such as methyl(meth)acrylate, n"butyl(meth)acrylate, tert-butyl(meth)acrylate, cyclohexyl(meth)acrylate and 2-ethylhexyl(meth)acrylate; aryl(meth)acryiates such as benzyl(meth)acrylate and phenyl(meth)acrylate; hydroxyalkyl(meth)acrylates such as hydroxyethyl(meth)acrylate and hydroxypropyl(meth)acrylate; (meth)acrylates with other types of functionalities (e.g. oxirane, amino, fluoro, polyethylene oxide, phosphate-substituted) such as glycidyl (meth)acrylate, dimethylaminoethyl(meth)acrylate, trifluoroethyl acrylate, methoxypolyethyleneglycol (meth)acrylate and<br>
triprDpyleneglycol(meth)acrylate phosphate; allyl derivatives such as allyl glycidyl ether; styrenics such as styrene, 4-methylstyrene, 4-hydroxystyrene, and 4-acetoxystyrene; (meth)acrylonitrile; (meth)acrylamides (including N-mono and N,N-disubstituted) such as N-benzyl (meth)acrylamide; maleimides such as N-phenyl maleimide, N-benzyl maleimide and N-ethyl maleimide; vinyl derivatives such as vinyjcaprolactam, vinylpyrrolidone, vinylimidazole, vinylnaphthalene and vinyl halides; vinylethers such as vinylmethyl ether; and vinylesters of carboxylic acids such as vinylacetate and vinylbutyrate.<br>
Initiators<br>
[0082] The curable fluid used in the ink-jet printing method according to the<br>
present invention preferably also contains an initiator. The initiator typically initiates the polymerization reaction. The initiator can be a thermal initiator, but is preferably a photo-initiator. The photo-initiator requires less energy to activate than the monomers, oligomers and/or prepolymers to form the<br><br>
polymer. The photo-initiator suitable for use in the curable fluid may be a Norrish type I initiator, a Norrish type II initiator or a photo-acid generator. The thermal initiator(s) suitable for use in the curable fluid include tert-Amyl peroxybenzoate, 4,4-Azobis(4-cyanovaleric acid), 1,V-Azobis(cyclohexanecarbon[trile), 2,Z-Azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN), Benzoyl peroxide, 2,2-Bis( tert-butylperoxy)butane, 1,1-Bis( tert-butylperoxy)cyclohexane,1,1-Bis( tert-butylperoxy)cyclohexane, 2,5-Bis( tert-butylperoxy)-2,5-dimethylhexane, 2,5-Bis( tert-Butylperoxy)-2,5-dimethyl-3-hexyne, Bis(1-( tert-butylperoxy)-1-methylethyl)ben2ene, 1,1-Bis( tert-butylperoxy)-3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane, tert-Butyl hydroperoxide, tert-Butyl peracetate. tert-Butyl peroxide, tert-Butyl peroxybenzoate, tert-Butylperoxy isopropyl carbonate, Cumene hydroperoxide, Cyclohexanone peroxide, Dicumyl peroxide, LauroyI peroxide, 2,4- Pentanedione peroxide, Peracetic acid and Potassium persulfate. The photo-initiator absorbs light and is responsible for the production of free radicals or cations. Free radicals or cations are high-energy species that induce polymerization of monomers, oligomers and polymers and with polyfunctional monomers and oligomers thereby also inducing cross-linking.<br>

The photo-initiator used may be a single compound, a mixture of two or more active compounds, or a combination of two or more different compounds, i.e. co-initiators. Non-limiting examples of suitable cationic photo-initiators are aryldiazonium salts, diaryliodonium salts, triarylsulphonium salts, triarylselenonium salts and the like.<br><br>
The curable fluid may contain a photo-initiator system containing photo-initiator(s) and one or more sensitizer dyes that absorb light and transfer energy to the photo-initiator(s). Suitable sensitizer dyes include photoreducible xanthene, fluorene, benzoxanthene, benzothioxanthene, thiazine, oxazine, coumarin, pyronlne, porphyrin, acridine. azo, diazo, cyanine, merocyanine, diarylmethyl, triarylmethyl, anthraquinone, phenylenediamine, benzimidazole, fluorochrome, quinoline. tetrazole, naphthol, benzidine, rhodamine, indigo and/or indanthrene dyes.

Irradiation with actinic radiation may be realized in two steps by changing wavelength or intensity. In such cases it is preferred to use 2 types of photo-initiator together.<br>
Inhibitors<br>
[0097] Suitable polymerization inhibitors include phenol type antioxidants,<br>
hindered amine light stabilizers, phosphor type antioxidants, hydroquinone monomethyl ether commonly used in (meth)acrylate monomers, and hydroquinone, t-butylcatechol, pyrogallol may also be used. Of these, a phenol compound having a double bond in molecules derived from acrylic acid is particularly preferred due to its having a polymerization-restraining effect even when heated in a closed, oxygen-free environment. Suitable<br><br>
inhibitors are, for example, Sumilizer™ GA-80, Sumilizer™ GM and Sumilizer™ GS produced by Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd, Ciba Irgastab™ UV10 from CIBA Specialty Products and Genorad™ 16 available from RAHN.<br>
Since excessive addition of these polymerization inhibitors will lower the sensitivity to curing, it is prefered that the amount capable of preventing polymerization be detemined prior to blending. The amount of a polymerization inhibitor is generally between 200 and 20,000 ppm of the total weight of the curable fluid.<br>
Surfactants<br>
The curable fluid used in the ink-jet printing method according to the present invention may contain at least one surfactant. The surfactant{s) can be anionic, cationic, non-ionic, or zwitter-ionic and are usually added in a total quantity below 20 wt% based on the total curable fluid weight and particulariy in a total below 10 wt% based on the total weight of the curable fluid.<br>
A fluorinated or silicone compound may be used as a surfactant, however, a potential drawback is bleed-out after image formation because the surfactant does not cross-iink. It is therefore preferred to use a copolymerizable monomer having surface-active effects, for example, silicone-modified acrylates, silicone modified methacrylates, fluorinated acrylates, and fluorinated methacrylates.<br>
Dispersion medium<br>
The curable fluid contains monomers and/or oligomers as the dispersion medium but may further consist of water and/or organic solvents, such as alcohols, fluorinated solvents and dipolar aprotic solvents. However, the curable fluid preferably does not contain an evaporable component, but sometimes, it can be advantageous to incorporate an extremely small amount of an organic solvent in such inks to improve penetration of the curable fluid into the ink-receiving layer or adhesion to the surface of the ink-receiving layer after UV curing. In this case, the added solvent can l&gt;e any amount in the range which does not cause problems of solvent resistance and VOC, and preferably 0.1-5.0 wt%, and<br><br>
particularly preferably 0.1-3.0 wt%, each based on the total weight of the curable fluid.<br>

Polymeric dispersants<br>
The curable ink-jet ink used as curable fluid in the present Invention may further contain a polymeric dispersant. in order to obtain a stable dispersion of the pigment(s) in the ink-jet ink. Polymeric dispersants usable in this invention are not specifically restricted, but the following resins are preferred: petroleum type resins (e.g., styrene type, acryl type, polyester, polyurethane type, phenol type, butyral type, cellulose type, and rosin); and thermoplastic resins (e.g., vinyl chloride, vinylacetate type). Concrete examples of these resins include acrylate copolymers, styrene-acrylate copolymers, acetalized and incompletely saponified polyvinyl alcohol, and vinylacetate copolymers. Commercial resins are known under the tradenames Solsperse™ 32000 and Solsperse™ 39000 available from AVECIA, EFKA™ 4046 available from EFKA CHEMICALS BV, Disperbyk™ 168 available from BYK CHEMIE GMBH.<br>
Preferably a polymeric dispersant is used, but sometimes non-polymeric dispersants are also suitable. A detailed list of non-polymeric as well as some polymeric dispersants is disclosed by MC CUTCHEON. Functional Materials, North American Edition. Glen Rock,N.J.: Manufacturing Confectioner Publishing Co., 1990. p.110-129. ]  Typically dispersants are incorporated at 2.5% to 200%, more preferably at 50% to 150% by weight of the pigment<br>
Curing means<br><br>
The ink-receiving layer and the curable fluid can be cured by exposing it to actinic radiation, by thernal curing and/or by electron beam curing. A preferred means of radiation curing is ultraviolet radiation. Preferably the curing is performed by an overall exposure to actinic radiation, by overall thermal curing or by overall electron beam curing. When the curable fluid containing the curable compound is jetted on the ink-receiving layer according to a security image, the curing means may be an'anged in combination with the print head of the ink-jet printer, travelling therewith so that the security image printed on the ink-receiving layer is exposed to curing radiation very shortly after having been printed upon the ink-receiver. In such an arrangement it can be difficult to provide a small enough radiation source connected to and travelling with the print head. Therefore, a static fixed radiation source may be employed, e.g. a source of curing UV radiation, connected to the radiation source by means of flexible radiation conductive means such as a fibre optic bundle or an internally reflective flexible tube.<br>
Alternatively, the actinic radiation may be supplied from a fixed source to the radiation head by an arrangement of mirrors including a mirror upon the radiation head.<br>
The source of radiation an'anged not to move with the print head, may also be an elongate radiation source extending transversely across the ink-receiver surface to be cured and adjacent the transverse path of the print head so that the subsequent rows of images formed by the print head are passed, stepwise or continually, beneath that radiation source. Any ultraviolet light source, as long as part of the emitted light can be absorbed by the photo-initiator(system). may be employed as a radiation source, such as, a high or low pressure mercury lamp, a cold cathode tube, a black light, an ultraviolet LED, an ultraviolet laser, and a flash light. Of these, the preferred source is one exhibiting a relatively long wavelength UV-contribution having a dominant wavelength of 300-400 nm. Specifically, a UV-A light source is preferred due to the reduced light scattering therewith resulting in more efficient interior curing. UV radiation is generally classed as UV-A, UV-B, and UV-C as follows:<br><br>
.    UV-A: 400 nm to 320 nm<br>
•	UV-B:320 nm to 290nm<br>
•	UV-C: 290 nm to 100 nm.<br>
Furthemnore, it is possible to cure the security image using two light sources of differing wavelength or illuminance. For example, the first UV source can be selected to be rich in UV-C, in particular in the range of 240 nm-200 nm. The second UV source can then be rich in UV-A, e.g. a gallium-doped lamp, or a different lamp high In both UV-A and UV-B. The use of two UV sources has been found to have advantages e.g. a fast curing speed.<br>
For facilitating curing, the ink-jet printer often includes one or more oxygen depletion units. The oxygen depletion units place a blanket of nitrogen or other relatively inert gas (e.g.COa), with adjustable position and adjustable inert gas concentration, in order to reduce the oxygen concentration in the curing environment. Residual oxygen levels are usually maintained as low as 200 ppm, but are generally in the range of 200 ppm to 1200 ppm. Thennal curing can be performed image-wise by use of a themnal head, a heat stylus, hot stamping, a laser beam, etc. If a laser beam is used, then preferably an infrared laser is used in combination with an infrared dye in the ink-receiving layer.

thereof. Prefen-ed humectants are glycerol and 1,2-hexanediol. The humectant is preferably added to the Inkjet Ink formulation in an amount of 0.1 to 20 wt% of the formulation, more preferably 0.1 to 10 wt% of the formulation, and most preferably approximately 4.0 to 6.0 wt%.<br>
Other additives<br>
In addition to the constituents, described above, the ink-jet ink may, if necessary, further contain following additives to have desired perfomance: evaporation accelerators, rust inhibitors, crosslinking agents, soluble electrolytes as conductivity aid, sequestering agents and chelating agents, magnetic particles to introduce additional security features,...<br>
Preparation of ink-jet ink<br>
The ink-jet ink used in the ink-jet printing method according to the present invention can be prepared by simply mixing all components when the colorant is a dye. When pigments are used, a pigment dispersion may be prepared by mixing, milling and dispersion of pigment and polymeric dispersant. Mixing apparatuses may include a pressure kneader, an open kneader, a planetary mixer, a dissolver, and a Dalton Universal Mixer. Suitable milling and dispersion apparatuses are a ball mill, a peari mill, a colloid mill, a high-speed disperser, double rollers, a bead mill, a paint conditioner, and triple rollers. The dispersions may also be prepared using ultrasonic energy.<br>
Many different types of materials may be used as milling media, such as glasses, ceramics, metals, and plastics. In a preferred embodiment, the grinding media can comprise particles, preferably substantially spherical in shape, e.g. beads consisting essentially of a polymeric resin or yttrium stabilized zirconium beads.<br>
In the process of mixing, milling and dispersion, each process is preferably performed with cooling to prevent build up of heat. If the ink-jet ink used in the ink-jet printing method according to the present invention contains more than one pigment, the ink-jet Ink may be prepared using separate dispersions for each pigment, or alternatively several pigments may be mixed and co-milled in preparing the dispersion.<br><br>
The dispersion process can be carried out in a continuous, batch or semi-batch mode.<br>
The preferred amounts and ratios of the ingredients of the mill grind will vary widely depending upon the specific materials and the intended applications. The contents of the milling mixture comprise the mill grind and the milling media. The mill grind comprises pigment polymeric dispersant and a liquid canier such as water. For ink-jet inks, the pigment is usually present in the mill grind at 1 to 50 wt%, excluding the milling media. The weight ratio of pigment over polymeric dispersant is 20:1 to 1:2. i The milling time can vary widely and depends upon the pigment, mechanical means and residence conditions selected, the initial and desired final particle size, etc. In the present invention pigment dispersions with an average particle size of less than 100 nm may be prepared. After milling is completed, the milling media is separated from the milled particulate product (in either a dry or liquid dispersion fomi) using conventional separation techniques, such as by filtration, sieving through a mesh screen, and the like. Often the sieve is built into the mill, e.g. for a bead mill. The milled pigment concentrate is preferably separated from the milling media by filtration.<br>
In general it is desirable to make the ink-jet inks in the form of a concentrated mill grind, which is subsequently diluted to the appropriate concentration for use in the ink-jet printing system. This technique permits preparation of a greater quantity of pigmented ink from the equipment. If the mill grind was made in a solvent, it is diluted with water and optionally other solvents to the appropriate concentration. If it was made in water, it is diluted with either additional water or water miscible solvents to make a mill grind of the desired concentration. By dilution, the ink-jet ink is adjusted to the desired viscosity, surface tension, colour, hue, saturation density, and print area coverage for the particular application. Overcoat layer<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the cured and ink-jet printed ink-receiver is coated with a radiation curable coating composition. The curing of this<br><br>
overcoat layer may result in changes of the contrast depending on the fact if a pigmented or a dye based ink-jet ink was used to print the main image partially overlapping with the security image.<br>
Another observation is that the overcoat layer results in the formation of a relief with differences of height between 5 to 10 pm. This kind of tactile printing can be used for introducing security features.<br>
Industrial applicability<br>
The authentication mark obtained by the ink-jet printing method according to the present invention may be used in security documents, official documents issued by governments or other official and commercial institutions, bank notes, bonds, currency notes, cheques, share certificates, stamps, tax receipts, official records, diplomas, identification documents, security tags, labels, tickets, security badges, credit cards, packaging, brands, trademarks, logos or documents suitable for attachment to and/or association with a product of substantial value such as antique objects, audio and/or visual media (e.g. compact disks, audio tapes and video tapes), chemical products , tobacco products, clothing articles, wines and alcoholic beverages, entertainment goods, foodstuffs, electrical and electronic goods, computer software, high technology machines and equipment, jewellery, leisure items, perfumes and cosmetics, products related to the treatment, diagnosis, therapy and prophylaxis of humans and animals, military equipment, photographic industry goods, scientific instruments and spare parts therefor, machinery and spare parts for the transport industry and travel goods.<br>

PET100 is a 100 pm subbed PET substrate with on the coating side a<br>
subbing layer and on the backside a subbing layer and an antistatic layer<br>
available from AGFA-GEVAERT as P100C S/S AS. EXAMPLE 1 [0191] This example illustrates the method of ink-jet printing used to manufacture<br>
authentication marks. Preparation of the ink receiver [0192]  First a dispersion of silica, named DISP-1, was prepared by mixing the<br>
components according to Table 1.<br><br><br><br>
The dispersion DISP-1 was then used to prepare the coating solution<br>
COAT-1 by mixing 712 g of DISP-1, 69 g of a 50wt% solution of the<br>
polymer latex Co(Et-ViAc)) and 199 g of water.<br>
The coating solution COAT-1 was coated on PET100 by means of a<br>
coating knife (wet thickness 67 pm). the coated ink-receivers REC-1 was<br>
then dried for 4 minutes in an oven at eO^'C. Curing of the ink receiver [0195] A curable fluid is prepared by mixing the water-soluble monomer and the<br>
photo-initiator in water according to Table 2.<br>
[0196] Droplets of the prepared curable fluid were deposited on the ink-receiver REC-1 using a pipette. The ink receiver REC-1 was exposed with a CDL15021 from AGFA-GEVAERT at Level 3 (= 4000 pW/cm2) for 650 seconds.<br>
Ink-jet printing<br>
[0197]  An EPSON PHOTO STYLUS™ R300 from SEIKO EPSON was used with an EPSON R300 ink-jet ink set and a printer setting "PHOTO (+ HIGH SPEED)" to print an image containing a picture of a person and some text on the cured ink-receiver REC-1 in a way that the image was partially printed on areas where the curable fluid was deposited and partially on areas lacking the curable fluid.<br>
[0198]  Another sample of the cured ink receiver REC-1 was printed in the same manner with an EPSON STYLUS™ PHOTO R800 ink-jet printer using an EPSON R800 ink set, which consist of aqueous pigment based inks.<br>
Result and evaluation<br>
[0199]  Authentication marks became visible on the printed samples of the ink receiver REC-1.<br><br>
The optical density of two colour areas in the ink-jetted main image (Black and Magenta) with the EPSON PHOTO STYLUS™ R300 were measured in transmission using a MacBeth tm TD904 with a green filter and in reflection using a MacBeth™ RD918SB with a red filter, both in an area where the curable fluid was deposited and in an area lacking curable fluid. The measured results are given by Table 3.<br><br>
The optical density of two colour areas in the ink-jetted main image (Green and Violet) with the EPSON STYLUS™ PHOTO R800 were measured in transmission using a MacBeth™ TD904 and in reflection using a MacBeth™ RD918SB, both in an area where the curable fluid was deposited and in an area lacking curable fluid. In both measurements, provided filters in the McBeth™ densltimeters were used: the blue filter for the green colour area and the green filter for the violet colour area. The measured results are given by Table 4.<br><br>
From Table 3 and Table 4 it is clear that in transmission the optical density was enhanced in the areas of the ink receiver where cured curable fluid was present. In reflection a lower and opposite contrast was obsen/ed.<br><br>
In an additional experiment it was found that no authentication marks were observed when the sample was not cured before printing the second image.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
[0204] This example illustrates that no authentication marks are obtained when the steps in the method of ink-jet printing are perfomed in a different order.<br>
Ink-jet printing<br>
[0205]  The same ink receiver REC-1 of EXAMPLE 1 was printed upon with the non-radiation curable Inkjet ink sets Epson Photo Stylus R800 and Epson Photo Stylus R300 before (=Order A) and after (=Order B) the radiation curable fluid of Table 2 was applied to the ink receiver. The Inkjet printing, the curable fluid application and the radiation curing was performed in the same manner as in EXAMPLE 1.<br>
The optical densities of two colour areas in the ink-jetted main image were measured in reflection using a MacBeth™ RD918SB using a suitable colour filter. The difference In optical density between a colour area where the curable fluid was deposited and cured and the same colour area lacking curable fluid is given by Table 5.<br><br>
[0207]  From Table 5, it is clear that when the aqueous dye or pigment based<br>
Inkjet inks were jetted before application of a curable fluid pattern, that no authentication marks were observed. However, when order B was used, i.e. first depositing and curing a curable fluid and then jetting the colour Inkjet inks, authentication marics were cleariy observed.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
