				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates generally to digital wireless communications systems<br>
in which delays of multi-path components of a time-varying fading channel are to be<br>
estimated, such as, for example, systems using RAKE receivers in Code Division Multiple<br>
Access (CDMA) systems. The invention is particularly suitable for, but is not limited to,<br>
receivers that operate in fading environments and have limited processing resources, such as<br>
those in Wideband CDMA (WCDMA) terminals.<br>
HISTORY OF RELATED ART<br>
In wireless communications, a physical channel between a transmitter and a receiver<br>
is formed by a radio link. In most cases, a transmit antenna is not narrowly focused towards<br>
the receiver and, in addition to a possible direct path, many other propagation paths exist<br>
between the transmitter and the receiver. The propagation paths are often caused by<br>
reflections from surrounding objects. Rays with similar propagation distances combine at<br>
the receiver depending on an instantaneous phase relationship and form a distinct multi-path<br>
component. The effect of the combining depends on an instantaneous relationship of a<br>
carrier wavelength and distance differences and, in the case of destructive interference, the<br>
combining leads to a significant reduction in path-gain magnitude (i.e., fading).<br>
Performance of a CDMA receiver is oftentimes improved if signal energy carried by<br>
many multi-path components is utilized via a RAKE receiver. In the RAKE receiver, a<br>
number of multi-path components are each assigned a despreader having a reference copy<br>
of a spreading code that is delayed equally to a path delay of a corresponding muiti-path<br>
signal component. Outputs of the despreaders (i.e., RAKE fingers) are coherently<br>
combined to produce a symbol estimate.<br>
The RAKE receiver requires knowledge of the multi-path delays and channel-<br>
impulse-response values for as many signal paths as possible. To achieve an optimal signal-<br>
to-noise ratio (SNR) at an output of a RAKE combiner, signal energy from as many<br>
physical paths as possible should be collected.  In addition, tracking of as many different<br><br><br>
physical paths as possible (i.e., higher utilized diversity) tends to significantly increase<br>
reception robustness by reducing the probability of a simultaneous deep fade of all tracked<br>
signal paths. Simultaneous deep fading of all tracked signal paths is a phenomenon that<br>
leads to undesirable block error rate (BLER) degradation.<br>
A propagation channel structure (i.e., absolute and relative delays of individual<br>
multi-path components) does not remain constant over time. Due to relative movement of<br>
the transmitter, the receiver, and nearby objects, existing path delays change, old paths<br>
disappear, and new paths appear. In addition, a frequency offset between the transmitter<br>
and receiver often gives rise to a slow clock drift, which may manifest itself as a gradual<br>
delay-profile time-axis movement In order to ensure proper operation of the RAKE<br>
receiver, varying delays of all known multi-path components should be tracked, and new<br>
paths should be discovered quickly after they appear.<br>
FIGURE 1 is a block diagram of a typical RAKE receiver. A RAKE receiver 100<br>
includes a delay estimator block 102, a channel estimator block 104, and a RAKE<br>
despreader/combiner block 106. Received data are fed to the delay estimator block 102.<br>
The delay estimator block 102 evaluates an impulse response of a channel over a range of<br>
possible delays of the channel. A resulting delay profile, which may be a complex delay<br>
profile or a power delay profile, may then be subjected to peak detection and detected peak<br>
locations reported to the RAKE despreader/combiner block 106 as delay estimates for the<br>
multi-path components. The delay estimates are also used by the channel estimator block<br>
104 to estimate corresponding complex channel coefficients by despreading a pilot<br>
sequence and possibly filtering results over time to reduce the effects of noise and<br>
interference. Channel parameters are estimated in collaboration between the delay<br>
estimator block 102, which determines temporal alignment of a despreader portion of the<br>
RAKE despreader/combiner block 106, and the channel estimator block 104, which<br>
estimates the complex coefficients to be used by a combiner portion of the RAKE<br>
despreader/combiner block 106.<br>
European Patent Application EP-A-1 480 369, published on 24 November 2004,<br>
appears to disclose a method and device that compensate sampling instant errors in digital<br>
receivers wherein a received signal is downconverted and sampled, yielding a digital<br>
baseband signal. The digital baseband signal is men, directly or after an oversampling, fed<br>
to a path delay estimator, which provides information about the power delay profile (PDP).<br><br><br>
The optimal sampling instant is computed by placing finger at delays corresponding to<br>
the peaks of the PDP and sampling instants are adjusted. The disclosed process does not<br>
compute a delay profile of the detected signal path clusters using a fixed grid. In addition,<br>
the disclosed process does not determine an adjusted delay profile based on phase.<br>
In "Rake receiver finger placement for realistic channels" by C.Cozzo et al., two different<br>
finger placement approaches appear to be disclosed for Rake receivers using a path<br>
searcher, which estimates the power/delay profile (PDP) of the received signal to<br>
determine where signal energy is present. The first finger placement approach places<br>
fingers at delays corresponding to the peaks of the PDP, with a restriction that fingers can<br>
be no closer than some minimum spacing. The second finger placement approach places<br>
fingers on an equally-spaced grid of delays. The grid approach is determined to be<br>
promising and warrant further studies. See Wireless Communications and Networking<br>

does not determine an adjusted delay profile based on phase.<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
A more complete understanding of the present invention may be obtained by reference to<br>
the following Detailed Description of Exemplary Embodiments of the Invention, when<br>
taken in conjunction with the accompanying Drawings, wherein :<br>
FIGURE 1, previously described, is a block diagram of a typical RAKE receiver, and<br>
FIGURE 2, is a flow chart that illustrates a delay-estimation process<br><br><br>
DETAILED   DESCRIPTION   OF   EXEMPLARY   EMBODIMENTS   OF   THE<br>
INVENTION<br>
Embodiment(s) of the invention will now be described more fully with reference to<br>
the accompanying Drawings. The invention may, however, be embodied in many different<br>
forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodimen(s) set forth herein. The<br>
invention should only be considered limited by the claims as they now exist and the<br>
equivalents thereof.<br>
Two approaches to delay estimation (DE) are as follows: 1) peak-detection-oriented<br>
DE; and 2) fixed-grid DE. In peak-detection-oriented DE, a precise position (i.e., a delay)<br>
of a particular multi-path component is estimated in order to tune a respective despreader<br>
precisely to the estimated delay. In principle, peak-detection-oriented DE involves<br>
evaluating a channel impulse response over an entire range of possible delays (i.e., delay<br>
spread) of the channel in question. A resulting complex delay profile (CDP) or power delay<br>
profile (PDP) may then be subjected to peak detection. The peak locations (di) are reported<br>
to the RAKE receiver as delay estimates.<br>
Processing and power-consumption expenses of frequently executing a full path-<br>
searching routine in accordance with peak-detection-oriented DE are usually prohibitive.<br>
Therefore, typical implementations may use path searchers (PS) with observation windows<br>
shorter than a full search area (i.e., maximal assumed delay spread) and reduced PS<br>
resolution (e.g., 1 chip). Additional densely-sampled windows of despreaders may be used<br>
that produce higher-resolution (e.g., 1/4 chip) estimates of certain areas of the PDP for<br>
precise reporting of delays.<br>
Fixed-grid DE is based on the principle that, in order to capture all available signal<br>
energy, it is not necessary to place RAKE fingers exactly on path positions. It is instead<br>
sufficient to lay a grid of fingers with a certain minimal spacing, equal to the Nyquist<br>
sampling rate of the received signal, over a delay-domain area where a dominant portion of<br>
the signal energy lies.<br>
In fixed-grid DE, the grid is fixed in the sense that the only delay values allowed are<br>
kT, where T is the grid spacing (e.g., T = 3/4Tc, where Tc is the chip period) and k is an<br>
integer value. Thus, in fixed-grid DE, it is necessary only to determine the edges of a PDP<br>
active region  and turn on the grid positions . In<br>
6<br><br>
fixed-grid DE, no attempt is made to isolate the precise location of individual paths. In<br>
some cases, if the active PDP includes several clusters, the grid is placed in several<br>
positions. So-called empty regions of the PDP are not covered.<br>
While fixed-grid DE does not attempt to estimate the precise delays of the individual<br>
components, the delay list at its output provides similar information to that provided by<br>
peak-detection-oriented DE. The delay list provided by either fixed-grid DE or peak-<br>
detection-oriented DE is used identically by subsequent RAKE-receiver blocks.<br>
Peak-detection-oriented DE provides an economical despreading arrangement if, for<br>
example, the channel consists of a single well-defined path. A location of the single path<br>
may then be detected relatively easily and precisely and a single RAKE finger may extract<br>
all available energy. In similar fashion, if the channel consists of several separated well-<br>
defined paths and the peak detection may be applied to each of them, peak-detection-<br>
oriented DE is quite economical.<br>
On the other hand, if the channel consists of a closely-spaced cluster of paths, it may<br>
be difficult to identify individual path positions, since signal energy from the different paths<br>
typically overlaps due to side lobes of transmit/receive ("tx/rx") filters. Furthermore, while<br>
the physical-path delays may remain constant, multi-path fading and a constantly-changing<br>
complex combining pattern of neighboring paths often causes a constant fluctuation of the<br>
observed PDP; therefore, tracking of the apparently-changing, but actually physically-fixed,<br>
delay positions can be quite challenging. Resulting difficulties for a DE process oftentimes<br>
create a need for heuristic mechanisms to avoid various pathological behaviors. However,<br>
the heuristic mechanisms can serve to tune the DE process to special cases and reduce the<br>
general applicability of the process. If an attempt is made to catch a path with a single<br>
finger, and the finger is misplaced even by 1/4 chip or 1/2 chip, a significant portion of the<br>
path energy is lost, and the interference is increased.<br>
Fixed-grid DE, in contrast, provides a much more robust way to capture the signal<br>
energy, since no assumptions are made about the precise path locations of the paths, inter-<br>
path distances, or fading behavior. As long as the true delay di satisfies τleft
detected signal energy is optimally utilized. However, since it is not certain that di = kT for<br>
some k, but rather kT<di several and typically two fingers must be placed to></di>
capture full path energy from a single path.<br><br><br>
As a general principle, in fixed-grid DE, to capture energy from a cluster of width<br>
mT (or from m Nyquist-spaced neighboring paths), m + 1 fingers are needed. The number<br>
of necessary m + 1 fingers is always greater than for peak-detection-oriented DE, and may<br>
be as much as twice the number of fingers used in peak-detection-oriented DE if the delay<br>
profile contains only stand-alone paths. For an extended path cluster, the extra expenditure<br>
of fingers is negligible.<br>
In various embodiments of the invention, a DE approach is used that allows non-<br>
peak-specific finger positions for multi-peak clusters, while avoiding mis-sampling and<br>
wasted fingers under single-path circumstances. A DE process applies fixed-grid finger<br>
placement to each PDP path cluster, while a grid offset is adjusted individually for each<br>
cluster, thereby allowing sampling-phase optimization for single-peak objects in the PDP,<br>
avoiding placement of unnecessary fingers, and maintaining robust coverage of extended<br>
clusters. A mechanism detects the proper sampling phase for a given cluster by correlating<br>
the PDP of the cluster with a single-path PDP or other waveform at various sampling<br>
offsets; if a peak is found in the filtering result, the fixed grid phase for the given cluster is<br>
adjusted without affecting the phase of the other clusters. Various embodiments of the<br>
invention allow handling of smgle-path-dominated clusters efficiently as single paths<br>
without requiring a heuristic decision operation on each signal cluster.<br>
FIGURE 2 is a flow chart that illustrates a delay-estimation process 200. In<br>
connection with the process 200, an input data sampling period is denoted Ts (e.g., Ts = Tc/4,<br>
where Tc is a CDMA chip period). A PDP with values gk is calculated at a resolution T<br>
(e.g., T = 3Tc/4), which is typically a lesser resolution than the input sampling period Ts in<br>
order to conserve computation resources. The DE process 200 may report as many as P<br>
paths.<br>
The DE process 200 begins at step 202. At step 202, regions of energy (i.e., signal<br>
path clusters) j in the PDP are defined by detecting a left and a right boundary for each:<br>
  The boundary detection performed at step 202 may be implemented<br>
as, for example, a thresholding operation requiring that a signal-path cluster element be<br>
greater than a pre-defined value, such as, for example, two times stronger than a PDP noise<br>
floor.<br>
From step 202, execution proceeds to step 204. At step 204, a counter j is started at<br>
an initial value of zero.   At step 206, the counter j is incremented.   At step 208, a<br><br>
determination is made whether the counter j has exceeded the pre-defined value J, J being<br>
the number of previously-detected signal clusters from step 202. If, at step 208, it is not<br>
determined that the counter has exceeded J, execution proceeds to step 210.<br>
From step 208, if it is determined that the counter has not exceeded J, steps 210-218<br>
are performed for j = 1... J (i.e., for each signal path cluster). Although steps 210-218 are<br>
illustrated in FIG. 2 as being performed sequentially, those having ordinary skill in the art<br>
will appreciate that steps 210-218 may also be performed in parallel without departing from<br>
principles of the invention. In particular, at step 210, the signal path cluster under<br>
consideration (i.e., signal path cluster j) is correlated with a waveform  suitable for<br>
deducing the path structure of the cluster (i.e., a different waveform for each grid phase t<br>
within the Ts scale). The waveform may be, for example, a single-path PDP waveform or<br>
the response of a filter implementing the inverse of a single-path pulse shaping operation.<br>
At step 212, the grid phase tj that produces the strongest correlation peak in the signal path<br>
cluster j is found.   In other words, for t = 0.. . L-1, a correlation product   is<br>
calculated as follows:   The grid phase tj is determined as<br><br>
From step 212, execution proceeds to step 214. At step 214, the PDP of cluster,/ is<br>
re-sampled, via interpolation, to produce   in the interval   Those<br>
having ordinary skill in the art will recognize that various different interpolation schemes<br>
may be used without departing from principles of the invention. From step 214, execution<br>
proceeds to step 216. At step 216, the edges of the current cluster (i.e., cluster<br>
J) are detected with an offset grid determined via the interpolation of step 214. If the cluster<br>
j is a single-path object, the new boundaries are   From step 216, execution<br>
proceeds to step 218. At step 218, a position list and a corresponding<br><br>
PDP value list  are reported for the cluster j. From step 218,<br>
execution returns to step 206.<br>
&gt; If, at step 208, it is determined that; &gt; J, execution proceeds to step 220. At step<br>
220, the P largest values over all Gj, j-\ .. .J are selected and corresponding delays from<br>
Dj are reported as the delay estimates and output from the delay estimator. From step 220,<br>
execution returns to step 202.<br>
The PDP generation may be performed for the original fixed grid positions kT at all<br>
times in order to simplify, for example, a hardware implementation, as the re-sampling<br>
provides the necessary shift per cluster. The correlation may be done rarely, for example,<br>
every N-th DE update cycles, where N is chosen so as to limit path movement/drift during<br>
the NTDE slots to a distance less than TS, where TDE is the time corresponding to a DE update<br>
cycle.<br>
In some embodiments of the invention, the grid phase correction is helpful if a clear<br>
correlation peak exists (i.e., a single defined peak exists in the cluster), while in the absence<br>
of a clear peak near the edge of the cluster, the correction does not necessarily noticeably<br>
improve the finger-allocation economy. Therefore, in some embodiments, processing<br>
resources may be saved by an implementation that performs the re-sampling and edge re-<br>
detection only if a correlation peak is found at a cluster edge. Furthermore, in some<br>
embodiments of the invention, a procedure targeting only single-path objects in the PDP for<br>
re-sampling may skip all processing for clusters wider than the single-path PDP waveform.<br>
A CDP may be used instead of a PDP, in which case the power of each delay profile<br>
element is found by multiplying the complex coefficient by its complex conjugate. Edge<br>
detection criteria and threshold values other than those described above may be used<br>
without departing from principles of the invention. The PDP may be computed for the<br>
adjusted delay positions; if so, no PDP re-sampling is needed in many cases. Correlation<br>
peak detection periods may be equal to or different from the DE update period. Different<br>
criteria for processing individual PDP clusters may be used.<br>
Various embodiments of the present invention may be implemented in, for example,<br>
hardware, software (e.g., carried out by a processor that executes computer-readable<br>
instructions), or a combination thereof. The computer-readable instructions may be<br>
program code loaded in a memory such as, for example, Random Access Memory (RAM),<br>
or from a storage medium such as, for example, Read Only Memory (ROM). For example,<br><br>
a processor may be operative to execute software adapted to perform a series of steps in<br>
accordance with principles of the present invention. The software may be adapted to reside<br>
upon a computer-readable medium such as, for example, a magnetic disc within a disc drive<br>
unit. The computer-readable medium may also include a flash memory card, EEROM<br>
based memory, bubble memory storage, ROM storage, etc. The software adapted to<br>
perform steps according to principles of the present invention may also reside, in whole or<br>
in part, in static or dynamic main memories or in firmware within a processor (e.g., within<br>
microcontroller, microprocessor, or a microcomputer internal memory).<br>
It should be emphasized that the terms "comprise/comprises/comprising" when used<br>
in this specification are taken to specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, or<br>
components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features,<br>
integers, steps, components or groups thereof.<br>
The previous Detailed Description is of embodiment(s) of the invention. The scope<br>
of the invention should not necessarily be limited by this Description. The scope of the<br>
invention is instead defined by the following claims and the equivalents thereof.<br><br>

ABSTRACT<br><br>
METHOD OF AND SYSTEM FOR DELAY ESTIMATION<br>
WITH MINIMIZED FINGER ALLOCATION<br>
A signal-path delay-estimation method (200) includes correlating (210) a computed<br>
coarse delay profile of at least one detected signal path cluster with a waveform to yield<br>
a strongest correlated peak for each of the at least one detected signal path cluster. The<br>
method also includes, for each of the at least one detected signal path cluster,<br>
using(212) the strongest correlated peak to determine an adjusted delay-profile phase,<br>
re-sampling (214) the computed coarse delay profile in accordance with the adjusted<br>
delay-profile phase, and detecting (216) signal-path-cluster edges using the re-sampled<br>
(214) computed coarse delay profile. This Abstract is provided to comply with rules<br>
