				<td>The present invention relates to a composition useful for providing protective and decorative coating on terracotta and earthenware articles. The process of the present invention particularly relates to the use of wide variety of common clay with colourant and colour transfer for making coating materials called bonok with wide ranging applicability.<br>
The main usage of the bonok is in the field of common clay wares and terracotta bodies for inparting the articles more imperviousness to moisture and water, glossiness, colour of choice and elegance and decor. The said articles may also be used as roofing tiles, wall tiles, cooking wares, art objects and allied and related items.<br>
The present day method of making bonok essentially consists of using particular variety of clay available in selected places directly or after beneficiation of such clay by various processes. Two such clays are separately taken, mixed with sufficient quantity of water in a container and hand blunged thoroughly so that the clay materials are dispersed with or without adding some dispersing agents. This mixture is then left for 24 hrs for thorough dispersion of the clay as well as for settling of the coarse particles at the bottom. Next day, the liquid in the form of a vary thin slurry containing very fine particles of clay is decanted into another container. The two clays in the slurry form are mixed together and left for ageing for 4 to 7 days.<br>
The slurry is then screened through a fine cloth to remove any coarse material. The screened liquid is finally boiled or sun dried to reduce the volume to about one-third of the original volume and then directly used on the green articles as coating material called bonok for which references may be made to "Status of Rural pottery in India" - A Bastar Scenario, T. K. Mukhopadhyay and T. K. Dan, Indian J. Rural Technology, 7( 1 &amp; 2) 1995, 63-76., "Coloured Engobes for Roofing Tiles", I. Ivanov et al, Interbrick, Vol. 5, No. 3,1989, pp 20-21., "Preparation and application of Eagobes", the final report on technology UPGRADATION for production of terracotta figurines and garden articles utilising locally available raw materials in the District of Bastar, M. P., Submitted to CSIR, Sept 1996, pp. 23-24, leading to a product with narrow application range and insufficiency in quantity in comparison to the amount of initial raw materials taken. Bonok is also made by other process very similar to this process. The main draw backs of the above processes may be listed as below.<br>
1.	Any available common clay is not suitable for making bonok.<br>
2.	Properties of the coating developed after firing has no flexiability.<br>
3.	The process is rigidly dependent on the specificity of raw materials.<br>
4.	Percentage yield of bonok is exceedingly low.<br>
S. Nature of the raw materials determines the colour of the final product<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for making coating<br>
material for providing protective and decorative coating on terracotta articles<br>
which obviate  the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to utilise non clay materials in addition to<br>
clay for making the coating material.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to eliminate the need to depend on a<br>
particular type of clay for making the coating material.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a coating material that<br>
imparts different colours to the finished articles.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a coating material mat<br>
imparts glossiness to the finished articles.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a coating which imparts<br>
imperviouaness to the finished articles.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a coating having enhanced<br>
scratch resistance.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a coating which makes<br>
terracotta products resistant to moisture.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a coating which makes the<br>
terracotta products resistant to weather.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a coating which makes the<br>
terracotta products resistant to water.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a coating which decorates the<br>
terracotta products.<br>
Accordingly,   the   present   invention   provides   a   composition   useful   for   providing<br>
protectective   and   decorative   coating  on  terracotta  and   earthenware   articles  which<br>
comprises:<br>
Name of the constituents	Amount in wt. %<br>
Common clay	85-98<br>
Red oxide	1-15<br>
Talc	1-10<br>
Boric acid	1-5<br>
Black stain	1-10<br>
Borax	0-6<br>
Soda lime glass	1-40<br>
Flint glass	1-40<br>
Lead bisilicate	0-5<br>
Green stain	1-10<br>
Oxides and halides of transition metals	0-10<br>
The composition obtained by the process of the present invention is neither a<br>
product of chemical reaction nor a mere admixture but is a synergistic formulation having properties different than the aggregate properties of the individual components<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for making coating material useful for providing protective and decorative coating on terracotta and earthenware articles which comprises proportioning and thorough mixing and grinding the above composition with common clay in the presence of 150 to 300 wt. % water of total solid content to obtain a slurry, sieving the said slurry through<br>
400 mesh BS, mixing 0.01 to 0.2 percent sodium carbonate and 0.02 to 0.4 percent<br>
sodium silicate of total solid content to the slurry so obtained followed by ageing<br>
for a period in the range of 6 hrs to 36 hrs..<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention wherein the thorough mixing and<br>
grinding may be effected for a period of 12 hours to 72 hours by grinding and ball<br>
milling using porcelain or aluminium oxide balls of diameter 1 cm to 5 cm or by<br>
attrition milling using porcelain or aluminium oxide balls of diameter 0.1 cm to 0.3<br>
cm.<br>
In another embodiment the grinding and ball milling or attrition milling may be<br>
effected using porcelain aluminium oxide balls 2 to 4 times the weight of the solid<br>
material content<br>
In still another embodiment colouring compounds may be introduced in clay batch<br>
and thorough mixing may be effected by milling.<br>
Yet in another embodiment of the present invention colour transfer may be<br>
introduced on the fired articles.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for making coated articles<br>
using the coating material prepared by the process of the present invention which<br>
comprises application of coating slurry on unfired terracotta/earthenware articles<br>
by known methods such as spraying, dipping or painting, drying the coated articles<br>
so obtained at a temperature hi the range of 80° C to 105° C for a period in the<br>
range of 4 hrs to 24 hrs and firing at a temperature in the range of 850° C to 1250°C for a period in the range of 0.5 hrs to 3 hours.<br>
The details of the process of the present invention are given below:<br>
A)	Common clay is mixed with different constituents like red oxide, talc, boric<br>
acid, black stain, borax, soda lime, flint glass powder, green stain, lead bisilicate,<br>
oxides and halides of transition metals, in the range of 0.00 percent to 50 wt<br>
percent, either alone or in combination with one another.<br>
B)	The mixed materials are charged in a pot mill or attrition mill along with water<br>
in the range of 150-300 wL% of total solid<br>
C)	Porcelain or alumina balls of size in the range of 1 • 5 cm, having weight in the<br>
range of 2 to 4 times the weight of the solid are put in the pot mill or porcelain or<br>
alumina balls of size in the range of 0.1 to 0.3 cm,   having weight in the range of<br>
3 - 4 times the weight of the solid are put in the attrition mill.<br>
D)	Pot mill or attrition mill is run for a period in the range of l2 - 72 hours.<br>
E)	After milling the milled material is sieved to separate grinding balls.<br>
F)	Sodium carbonate in the range of 0.01 to 0.2% and sodium silicate in the range<br>
0.02 to 0.4 wt% are mixed with the shiny and kept for a period in the range of 6 -<br>
36 hrs. for ageing.<br>
O) The shiny so produced is the coating material called bonok is applied on unfired articles by dipping, spraying or painting.<br>
H) Coated articles are dried at a temperature in the range 80° C - 105° C for a period in the range 4 -24 hours.<br>
I) Dried articles are fired at a temperature in the range of 850° C -1250° C for a period in the range of 0.5 - 3 hours.<br>
The process of the present invention can be used to produce coated terracotta and earthen ware of various shapes and sizes required for application as art object, roofing tiles, wall tiles, utility wares and cooking wares.<br>
Common clay contains all the essential ingredients for producing articles of common use. The coating material or bonok is essentially a finer fraction of clayey material with required amount of fluxes to produce sufficient liquid phase at the firing temperature to give reduced pore microstructure retaining enough mechanical and thermo mechanical properties for the use suggested. Since the main body of the articles and the coating material applied on its surface belongs to the same class of material, homogeneous bonding with matching thermo mechanical properties characterises the system. Colourant introduced in the form of inorganic compounds in the system as amorphous, crystalline or in glassy state, will act as colour centre and will generate derived colour texture on the surfaces of the produced articles. Except the difference in particle size between coating material and the material of the body, no other parameters vary to a great extent as a<br>
consequence of which the coating and the main body of the article tends to assume<br>
a homogeneous monolithic structure improving the properties of the material as a<br>
whole.<br>
