				<td>A MECHANICAL TOOL FOR USE IN TIGHTENING ROBUST WIRE AROUND<br>
A SUBSTRATE<br>
This invention relates to a mechanical tools for use in tightening robust wire around a substrate, which is normally a timber post, a log, a water pipe or the like.<br>
US patents numbers 5,275,383 (Wick et al), and 5,752,551 (Trueblood), show prior arrangements of such tools. Both of these specifications teach a mechanical device for twisting wire ties around a substrate. Both comprise an elongated body (28, 15) having twisting means (38, 11) at one end and a twister member (30, 20) at the other. Both twister members comprise apertures (34,35), through which wire can be passed.   When the twisting means are actuated, the twister is rotated to twist the wire. This will enable the wire to be twisted about it fairly tight. However, there is a limit to how tightly the wire can be drawn on to the substrate unless a long twist of material is formed.<br>
Neither of Wick, et al, and Trueblood (nor any other patent specification of which the applicant is aware) showed the use of a twister member that is axially movable relative to the body. Hence, none hints at the arrangement of the invention.   In the premises, it is submitted that the invention as claimed constitutes a major improvement on the twisting apparatus of the documents mentioned.<br>
The present invention relates to a mechanical tool for use in tightening robust wire around a substrate, which is normally a timber post, a log, a water pipe or the like: the tool comprising: an elongated body, a gripping at one end of the body whereby the body may be rotated, a twister member rotatable with the body and having openings through which wire can pass in such manner that when the body is rotated by the handle the wire can be<br>
twisted about the substrate characterized in that the body is a hollow body<br>
having diametral slots at its lower part, an internally threaded member is<br>
carried within the body in a manner permitting it to move axially but not<br>
rotationally relative to the body, the twister member is carried by the<br>
threaded member and passes through the slots, a threaded spindle, which is<br>
held against axial movement relative to the body, engages the internally<br>
threaded member and has an extension projecting beyond the body and<br>
having means whereby it may be rotated relative to the body so that it moves<br>
the internally threaded member and with it the twister member relative to the<br>
body.<br>
By arranging that twister can be move axially relative to the body and by<br>
binding the wire to the twister, the first movement of the twister is to draw the<br>
wire tightly on to the substrate before the twisting commences.  Thus, the wire<br>
will be extremely tightly drawn on to the substrate.<br>
An embodiment of the invention will now be described by way of example<br>
with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein:<br>
Figure 1 : a perspective view of the device of the invention.<br>
Figure 2 : a side view of the device<br>
Figure 3 : a plane view of the device<br>
Figure 4 : a under plane view of the device<br>
Figure 5 : a section on line of 5-5 of figure 2.<br>
With reference to the drawings, the tool comprises of an elongated body<br>
(12), which is internally non-circular, preferably square section and having<br>
diametral slots (14) at its lower part. A cross-member extending through the<br>
slots being held by nuts (52 &amp; 54) located within the body. A nosepiece (20)<br>
at the end of the body and a gripping part (24) at the top end of the body<br>
preferably formed by a flat plate. An externally threaded member/ spindle<br>
(28) in the nut having an extension beyond the plate with a handle at the end of such extension. The wire can be received into the tapering grooves (22) of nosepiece (20) and to the end of the transverse members (68).<br>
The upper end of the body (12) is closed off by a transversally extending flat plate (24). The plate (24) has a central aperture (26) through a thickened annular part (27) surrounding the aperture (26). An externally threaded member / spindle (28) passes through the aperture (26) and has an upper extension (32) above the body (12). The extension (32) has a cross bore (34) thereby a handle passes through the cross bore (34). The handle (38) generally is in the shape of hexagon having an upper horizontal transverse part (40), a first vertical part (42) at one end thereof leading to a first downwardly inclined portion (44) which merges into a second horizontal portion (46), which passes through the bore (34), a second upwardly inclined portion (48) and a vertical portion (50) passes upwardly beyond the upper horizontal part (40). Clamping nuts (52) and (54) are provided on the spindle (28) on either side of the flat plate (24).<br>
Within the body (12), an internally threaded member / nut (62) in which the end of the spindle engages. The nut (62) is generally outside square section that fits the interior of the tubular body (12) and is restrained thereby against rotation. The lower end of the nut (62) has a cross-slot (64). A cross-bar (66) is received within the slot (64) and opposites halves project through the slots (14) respectively. The ends of the cross bar(66) respectively have grooves (68) therein.<br>
Rotating the spindle (28) by means of the handle (38), the nut (62) is moved upwardly and downwardly within the body (12) thus moving the cross-bar<br>
(66) upwardly and downwardly through a distance limited by the length of the slots (14).<br>
The device is intended for use in knotting the ends of a wire that has been wound around a log, a post, a water pipe or other similar substrate. The spindle (28) is rotated so that the nut (62) is at the lowest position within the body (12). The ends of the wire are crossed over and passed first through the grooves (22) in the nosepiece (20) and then through the grooves (68) in the adjacent ends of the crossO-bar (66). The wire ends are now wrapped around the ends of the cross-bar (66). By rotating the handle (38), the nut (62) together with the cross-bar (66) will move upwardly, which will apply a tensioning force to the wire.<br>
When the wire has been tightened, the user will rotate the device (10) about its axis thereby twisting the wire at its ends over the substrate. There will then be a firm knot, which will hold the wire permanently in a tight relationship on the substrate. The free ends of the wire can be cut short close to the knot. This rotation will be effected by grasping the plate (24) and consisting the gripping part and rotating it. Alternatively a spanner can engage the tube which itself constitutes the gripping part to rotate it. In summary the usage of the said mechanical device is as follows: After the wire has been wound up around the substrate, the opposite ends can be passed through the grooves in the nosepiece and in the transverse members; an externally threaded members/ spindle is rotated to move the nut upwardly to tension the cable and by grasping the flat plate or otherwise engaging the gripping part, the entire device can be rotated to twist the cable close to the substrate so that it will form in effect a knot to hold the cable tightly on to the substrate.<br>
This device of the present invention provides a very simple unit for tightening wire in this way and can be used with wires up to 31/2 mm diameter or more which are normally not very flexible and usually very difficult to tighten around the substrate. This is one of the beneficiary angle of the present invention.<br>
Further this invention is not limited to the precise constructional details as described and illustrated in the drawings. For instance, the handle may comprises of a simpler construction consisting only consisting only of a lower horizontal part and upstanding vertical part.<br><br><br><br>
