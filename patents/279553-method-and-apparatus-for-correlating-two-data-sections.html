Method and Apparatus for correlating two data sections<br>
The invention relates to a method and to an apparatus for correlating two data sections. Such correlation can be used in audio watermark decoding.<br>
Background<br>
Watermarking of audio signals intends to manipulate the au¬dio signal in a way that the changes in the audio content cannot be recognised by the human auditory system. Most au¬dio watermarking technologies add to the original audio sig¬nal a spread spectrum signal covering the whole frequency spectrum of the audio signal, or insert into the original audio signal one or more carriers which are modulated with a spread spectrum signal. There are many possibilities of wa¬termarking to a more or less audible degree, and in a more or less robust way. The currently most prominent technology uses a psycho-acoustically shaped spread spectrum, see for instance WO-A-97/33391 and US-A-6061793. This technology of¬fers a good compromise between audibility and robustness, although its robustness is suboptimal.<br>
Many audio watermarking technologies like spread-spectrum, or phase shaping as disclosed in US-A-2005/0033579 and in EP 05090261.8, use correlation with a reference sequence for detection in the decoder. The robustness of the watermark is improved by increasing the length of the reference sequence.<br>
Invention<br>
However, the memory and processing power needed for the cor¬relation increases more than proportional when increasing the reference sequence length. This leads to increased hard-<br>
 <br>
ware cost of a corresponding watermark detector.<br>
The problem to be solved by the invention is to reduce the required memory size and the required processing power. This problem is solved by the method disclosed in claim 1. An ap¬paratus that utilises this method is disclosed in claim 5.<br>
The general idea of the invention is to embed at encoder side the watermark symbols two (or more) times in the origi¬nal audio (or video) signal, and to use in a corresponding decoder a circular correlation instead of the standard one for the watermark decoding. The watermarked audio signal is decoded by correlating the received audio signal with a cor¬responding (e.g. inversely transformed) candidate reference sequence.<br>
A disadvantage is that the watermark information data rate of the watermark system is reduced slightly. However, the invention reduces the reqired memory size by a factor greater than two and reduces the required processing power by a factor greater than eight.<br>
In principle, the inventive method is suited for correlating part of a received data frame containing at least one data signal section having a given length N with a reference data section having said given length N, whereby said at least one data signal section is arranged at least two times in a successive manner in said data frame, said method including the steps:<br>
using a circular correlation, correlating said reference data section with at least a second part of a first received one of said successive data signal sections and with a cor¬responding first part of the repeated data signal section following said first received one data signal section;<br>
depending on whether or not the resulting correlation value is greater than a pre-determined threshold value or smaller or equal than the negative value of said pre-<br>
 <br>
determined threshold value, assigning to said correlation value either a first bit value or a second bit value differ¬ent from said first bit value.<br>
Advantageous additional embodiments of the invention are disclosed in the respective dependent claims.<br>
Drawings<br>
Exemplary embodiments of the invention are described with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings, which show in:<br>
Fig. 1  exemplary watermark data frame;<br>
Fig. 2 an example in which the reference sequence and the corresponding sync symbol are shifted;<br>
Fig. 3  data frame of Fig, 1 in which one or more sync se¬quences are embedded twice in the encoder;<br>
Fig. 4 a part of the first sync symbol, which is not corre¬lated, is exactly the same as the part of the second sync symbol that is correlated;<br>
Fig. 5 example block diagram of a watermark encoder and de¬coder.<br>
Exemplary embodiments<br>
Many audio watermarking technologies like spread spectrum or phase shaping as described in EP 05090261.8 embed some kind of reference sequences in the carrier signal. If binary phase shift keying (BPSK) is used, the polarity of the se¬quence encodes the bit value. For code shift keying (CSK), different sequences are used for the different values of the transmitted bit value.<br>
If the watermark message includes more than one bit, bits are combined in a data frame as shown in the exemplary data frame in Fig. 1, which frame starts with one or more syn-<br>
 <br>
chronisation symbols S1, S2 and S3 that are followed by sev¬eral payload symbols Pldl to Pld5. These payload symbols carry the watermark data and optionally parity data for er¬ror correction. Watermark data frames are normally inserted consecutively, i.e. the following data frame starts with its sync symbols after the last payload symbol of the current data frame.<br>
The decoding of a payload symbol is carried out using a cor¬relation. If for example BPSK is used, a_w denotes a vector of audio samples and r the reference vector with length N. The correlation value C is calculated as follows:<br>
C = Sum 1=1, i 0, a 'zero' value watermark bit is decoded, otherwise a 'one' value watermark bit is decoded. As an alternative, if C &gt; TH, a first watermark bit value is decoded, and if C 
This calculation of the correlation is only possible if a_w and r  are already synchronised. If they are. shifted by one or more samples, the following calculation 'is to be per¬formed:<br>
For k=l,   k<n: c sum i="l," a_w r the offset between a__w and can be found by looking for location of largest value in correlation vector c.></n:>
Fig. 2 depicts an example in which the reference sequence Rl and the corresponding sync symbol S1 are shifted by about N/4. The input vector of the correlation is therefore Rl and the corresponding second part of S1 and the corresponding first part of S2.<br>
The above calculation requires N*N multiplications, corre¬sponding to the order 0(N2). A fast way is known to calcu¬late the correlation by using an FFT:<br>
 <br>
C = IFFT(FFT(a0_w) * conj (FFT (rO) ) ) where aO_w  is a vector of which the first N elements are equal to the elements of a_w  and the following N-1 elements contain zeros. rO  is in the same way a zero padded version of r. This algorithm is of the order 0(log(2*N)*2*N). Advan¬tageously, for big values of N the FFT based approach is much faster than the direct one.<br>
The inventive improvement consists of the following two steps.<br>
Firstly, the one or more of the sync symbols or sequences S1 to S3 are embedded twice in the encoder as shown in Fig. 3. In this example the sync symbols S1 and S2 are embedded twice in the (watermark) data frame at encoder or transmit¬ter side. It is not necessary to double each symbol, because the first symbols are used for the synchronisation of the watermark data frame. If the sequences (i.e. the data frames) are synchronised there is no need for performing a full correlation.<br>
Secondly, for achieving synchronisation, at decoder or re¬ceiver side a circular correlation is calculated instead of the standard correlation. The circular correlation is calcu¬lated by:<br>
C = IFFT(FFT(a_w) * conj (FFT (r) ) )<br>
That part of the first SI symbol which is not correlated is exactly the same as the corresponding part of the second SI symbol which is correlated, as can be seen from Fig. 4. This is the reason why a circular correlation can be used instead of the standard correlation. Advantageously, since no zero padding is used, the calculation is of the order 0(log(N)*N), i.e. it is more than two times faster and re¬quires only about half the memory size as when calculating the standard correlation.<br>
 <br>
If no unambiguous correlation value is detected, the corre¬lation is to be calculated again for a position some samples later. If a standard correlation is used, the distance be¬tween two correlations should not be too long, since the correlation values diminish for longer de-synchronisations between signal and reference. For example, for a correlation of length N = 4096, the distance d between two correlations should not be longer than d  = 1024. Advantageously, if the inventive processing is used, the correlation values do not diminish, i.e. the distance between two correlations can be the full correlation length, i.e. for a correlation of length N = 4096, the distance can be d = 4096. As a result, the inventive synchronisation processing re¬duces the RAM needs by more than a factor of two and the MIPS needs by more than a factor of eight.<br>
The invention can be applied for example in watermarking systems like that depicted in Fig. 5. At encoder side, an original audio input signal AUI is fed (frame wise or block wise) to a phase change module PHCHM and to a psycho-acoustic calculator PSYA in which the current psycho-acoustic properties of the audio input signal are determined and which controls in which frequency range or ranges and/or at which time instants stage PHCHM is allowed to assign wa¬termark information to the phase of the audio signal. The phase modifications in stage PHCHM are carried out in the frequency domain and the modified audio signal is converted back to the time domain before it is output. These conver¬sions into frequency domain and into time domain can be per¬formed by using an FFT and an inverse FFT, respectively. The corresponding phase sections of the audio signal are manipu¬lated in stage PHCHM according to the phase of a spread spectrum sequence (e.g. an m-sequence) stored or generated in a spreading sequence stage SPRSEQ. The watermark informa¬tion, i.e. the payload data PD, is fed to a bit value modu¬lation stage BVMOD that controls stage SPRSEQ correspond-<br>
 <br>
ingly. In stage BVMOD a current bit value of the PD data is used to modulate the encoder pseudo-noise sequence in stage SPRSEQ. For example, if the current bit value is '1', the encoder pseudo-noise sequence is left unchanged whereas, if the current bit value corresponds to '0', the encoder pseudo-noise sequence is inverted. That sequence consists of a 'random' distribution of values, which may correspond to the structure of Fig. 3, and may have a length corresponding to that of the audio signal frames. The phase change module PHCHM outputs a corresponding watermarked audio signal WMAU. At decoder side, the watermarked audio signal WMAU passes (frame wise or block wise) through a correlator CORR in which its phase is correlated with one or more e.g. fre¬quency-to-time domain converted versions of the candidate decoder spreading sequences or pseudo-noise sequences (one of which was used in the encoder) stored or generated in a decoder spreading sequence stage DSPRSEQ. The correlator provides a bit value of the corresponding watermark output signal WMO.<br>
The invention is applicable in all technologies using corre¬lation for detection and in which the embedding process can be changed such that the reference signal is embedded twice.<br>
