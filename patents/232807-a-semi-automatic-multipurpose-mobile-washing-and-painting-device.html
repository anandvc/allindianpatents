				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a semi automatic multipurpose machine for use for white washing, painting and / or distempering purposes.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Spray machine for painting is as such known in the art and the use of this machine is restricted for painting steel almirah, wooden boxes, wooden doors and window and shutters. The main disadvantage associated with the spray machine is that it is not useful to paint frame of the doors and windows which are fitted in the walls of the house and buildings as the use of it spoils the adjoining area of the walls. Therefore the frames fitted with the walls are painted manually with the help of the brush which is a tiresome and time - consuming job.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore, an object of the present invention is to propose a semi automatic multipurpose machine for use for white washing, painting and / or distempering purposes.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a semi automatic multipurpose machine which is novel in construction and obviates the disadvantages associated with the prior art.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided a semi-automatic multipurpose mobile washing and painting device comprising: a base frame having atleast four legs each provided with a caster wheel; a top-open container having a detachable lid cover removably disposed on the base frame, the container accommodating washing and / or painting raw material including a mixing liquid, a first and a second inlet hole configured at a circumferential edge of the container in a spaced apart relationship; a manually-operated mixing means disposed on the detachable lid cover having a downwardly inwardly projected mechanical stirrer for mixing the raw material and the mixing liquid inside the container to form a liquid mixture; and a pump means disposed on the base frame being adjacent to the container for conveying the liquid mixture via a first conduit to a multipurpose brush, the discharge side of the pump means being connected to the first inlet hole of the container, a second conduit interposed in the first conduit being connected to the second inlet hole for conveying back a residual liquid mixture to the container, the multipurpose brush is provided with a pair of angular holes accommodating a pair of metallic conduits, the other end of the conduits being connected to a T-shaped joining member having a control valve for one of commencing and terminating delivery of liquid mixture via the first conduit, and in that the first conduit being connected at the middle of the T-shaped joining member.<br><br>
In accordance with this invention the semi automatic multipurpose machine has a drum for containing the material for use for white washing, painting and / or distempering. The drum is mounted on a base frame. The caster wheels are fitted with the lower surface of the bottom ends of the base frame for facilitating the movement of the machine. A cover having a mixer mechanism provided therewith for covering the top open end of the drum and for facilitating the mixing of the contents in the drum. A pump set is mounted at one side of the base frame for conveying the contents of the drum to a brush used for white washing, painting and / or distempering. The brush is connected with the outlet of the pump set by means of a conveying pipe provided for conveying the contents to the brush from the drum.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
A semi automatic multipurpose machine according to a preferred embodiment is herein described and illustrated in the accompanying drawings wherein:<br>
Figure 1 - Shows the isomatic view of the machine.<br>
Figure 2 - Shows the base frame of the machine.<br>
Figure 3 - Shows the drum of the machine.<br>
Figure 4 ~ Shows the cover along with mixer mechanism.<br>
Figure 5 - Shows the pump set.<br>
Figure 6 - Shows the brush.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
Referring to the drawings particularly figure 1 a semi automatic multipurpose machine has a frame 1 for supporting a drum 2 provided for storing the contents for white washing, painting and / or distempering. The frame is made of angle iron or steel pipes welded with each other. Caster wheels 3 (figure 2) are secured to the bottom end of the frame for the easy movement of the machine during its operation and transportation. The drum 2 is made of non - metallic or metallic material. Holes 4 are provided in the lower portion of the drum 2 for fitting the pump set 5 (figure 5) therewith for conveying the material to the brush 6 (figure 6) through a conveying pipe 7. The brush is used for white washing, painting and distempering. The pump set is mounted on one side of the base frame 1. A second pipe 7A is provided between the brush and the top hole of the drum 2 for conveying the excess material to the drum 2, if it is not being used with the same speed as of the conveying speed of the material to the brush. A cover 8 having mixer mechanism 9 provided therewith and adapted to be operated manually is provided for mixing the contents thoroughly contained in the drum 2 before its use by the machine for the required purposes.<br>
As shown in figure 6 the brush used for white washing, painting and / or distempering is of a unique construction having a pair of angular holes 1 i for inserting copper tubes therein provided for delivering the material amongst the<br><br>
hair of the brush. The other end of the copper tubes 11 are secured to a T provided for conveying the material to said copper tubes. A valve is provided with the T to supply or to stop the material to the brush. Another conveying pipe 7A is provided to get back the material to the drum when the valve is stopped by the user. The middle opening of the T is connected to the main conveying pipe 7.<br>
During the operation of the machine the water is filled into the drum and the pump set is switched ON to clean the conveying pipes, brush etc. Subsequently, the white washing, painting and distempering material is filled into the drum and the pump set is switched ON. The supply of the material is started to the brush. The operator presses the valve and the material is supplied amongst the hair of the brush and the operator start white washing, painting and distempering the item. Whenever the supply of the material is not required, the valve is closed by the operator and the material is conveyed back to the drum by the second conveying pipe provided to the brush. Thus, the amount of the material to be conveyed to the brush can be controlled by the operator as per the requirements. When the job is over the pump set is switched off and the machine is cleaned with the help of the water.<br><br><br><br>
