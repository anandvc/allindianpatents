SPINNING MACHINE WITH SEVERAL DRAFTING DEVICE DRIVES<br>
The following invention relates to a spinning machine with several drafting device drives in accordance with the preamble to the independent Claim.<br>
In the German published application DE 100 40 420 A1 a spinning machine of this type is shown, with several embodiments of the drafting device drives. The present invention is based on the problem of proposing a concept for drafting device drives which is flexible in application.<br>
This problem is resolved by a drafting device arrangement in accordance with the features of the independent claim(s). The dependent claims relate to advantageous further embodiments. The invention is described hereinafter in detail on the basis of the drawings. These show:<br>
Fig. 1	A diagrammatic representation of a spinning machine in a ground plan with<br>
several drafting device drive blocks, which are present in a number which corresponds to a number of segments of the spinning machine;<br>
Fig. 2	A wiring diagram for the drive motors of drive blocks;<br>
Fig. 3	An overview of control modules and drive components in their interaction in<br>
the spinning machine.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a diagrammatic overview drawing of the drafting device drives of a double-sided spinning machine. On both sides of the sections 70 are spinning positions 11, to which the fibre material is guided via the drafting rollers 522a, 522b, 522c. For this present situation it is assumed that four drafting device drive blocks 540a, 540b, 540a\ 540b' of the same type are located in each case at the ends of the drafting rollers. Further drive blocks 540c may also be located between the ends of the drafting rollers, of which in each case only one single block is indicated on each longitudinal side of the machine. Provided in the<br><br>
drive block 540a is a first upper electric motor 42a for driving the intake roller 522a and the middle roller 522b. The drive output is transferred via an intermediate power transfer unit 45a, in particular a toothed belt transfer unit, onto an intermediate power transfer/gear block 42b. From this two further intermediate power transfer/gear blocks 45b and 45c branch off: Coupled to the first is a power transfer/gear block 41b, which drives the middle roller 522b; a further power transfer/gear block 42b, for driving the intake roller 522a, is connected to the intermediate power transfer/gear block 42b. The delivery roller 522c has its own drive, with a motor 42aa, an intermediate power transfer/gear block 45d, and a reduction gear block 42b". A toothed belt drive can be provided in each case between an end drive unit 42b" and the drafting roller 522c allocated to this, for vibration damping as well as changing the revolution speed. The latter motor 42aa can also be coupled directly to the transfer unit 42b", without an intermediate power transfer/gear block 45d and a further shaft 41c. The interior of the drive block 540b can be structured in a mirror image to the arrangement of the elements in the drive block 540a, and further in the drive block 540b1. The arrangement of the elements in the drive block 540a' corresponds essentially to that in the drive block 540a, mirrored at the longitudinal axis of the spinning machine 1. An additional power transfer/gear block 540c of the same design, or several such blocks, can be located between the other blocks.<br>
One drive block 540a, 540b, 540a1, 540b1 each, together with the drafting cylinders 522a, 522b, 522c allocated to them, form a segment 21 or 21' respectively of a spinning machine. With a double-sided spinning machine according to Fig. 1, provided that a certain overall length over a number of 1000 spindles of about 50 metres is provided for, four drive blocks are to be provided for. It may also be to the purpose for a further drive block 540c to be provided between, for example, the drive blocks 540a, 540b, and 540c' on the opposite side of the spinning machine. It is understood that, if only the drive blocks 540a and 540b located at the machine ends are present, with roller sections 522a, 522b, 522c, then these will in each case only extend as far as the middle of the machine. This position is represented by a double vertical broken line arrangement. If further drive blocks 540c, 540c' are present, as is indicated in Fig. 1, then in each case, for example, an interruption of the roller strands is to be provided between a drive block 540a1 and 540c1,<br><br>
as represented by the broken double lines. For an operation of the spinning machine section by section, for example in segment 21 or 2V in the upper part of the spinning machine, it is of course only necessary for the drafting devices of the segment concerned to be operated, so that the drafting rollers 522a, 522b, 522c do not have to run over the entire machine length. With a double-sided spinning machine as represented in Fig. 1, at least two segments 21, 21' would be provided in the upper part, and a further two segments in the lower part, with the result that, for example, a "strand by strand spinning" process of the spinning machine would only be possible in the segment 21, and then subsequently in the segment 2V. This has the advantage that, after the machine has been loaded with new material, material will not run into the drafting device from all the roving yarn depositories, but, for example, only in the segment 21, then subsequently in the segment 21 ' as a result of which the personnel have sufficient time to set the individual spinning positions 11 into operation without unnecessary material being used up.<br>
In connection with the description from Fig. 1, reference may be made, for example, to the disclosure in the German Patent DE 100 40 420, with general explanations regarding the structure of a spinning machine and in particular of the drive possibilities fa drafting device as well as the structure of a drafting device.<br>
It is understood that several drive motors, which serve as the drive for one and the same drafting roller, such as the motors 42a in the power transfer/gear block 540a and the motor 42a of the power transfer/gear block 540c, which in common drive the drafting roller 522b, must be controlled in synchrony. This also applies if the drafting roller, for example 522b, is subdivided into several sections. If, for example, the motors 42a of the power transfer/gear blocks referred to are connected to a common control device or to one and the same frequency converter for the power supply, then the overall transfer ratio between the motor 42a and the power transfer/gear block 41b on the one hand in the power transfer/gear block 540a, and the electric motor 42a and the end power transfer/gear block 45e of the power transfer/gear block 540c on the other, must be of equal value.<br><br>
Preferred is a double-sided spinning machine, with spinning positions 11 arranged on both sides of sections 70, with a drafting device 20 with several rollers 22, whereby fibre material is conducted to the drafting rollers 522a, 522b, 522c, designed in such a way that on each side of the machine at least one drafting device drive block 540a, 540b, 540a', 540b' is located, with its own drive motor 42a, in each case at the ends of the drafting rollers, whereby these blocks, as represented in Fig. 1 with the reference numbers 540a, 540b, 540a', 540c', can be present in any desired selection.<br>
In Fig. 2, in the right-hand part, a central control unit with four control outputs is represented in diagrammatic form, which under normal circumstances are operated at 24 V DC. It is possible, if it is intended that the entire spinning machine is to be put into operation, for all four outputs to have Direct Current applied, which leads to the situation in which the contactors represented in the series of contactors 342a and 342aa are closed jointly, so that all the motors in the spinning machine can be put under current, such as, for example, the motors 42a and 42aa respectively. In order to switch on the entire machine, further contactors on the right of the converters UA, U1 and U2 are to be brought into the operating position, with a control output from the control device 30. The inverters U1 and U2, with 500 V DC applied on the intake side, deliver at the output side on the right an AC with variable frequency, as specified by the control unit 30. The inverter U1 is suitable, for example, for controlling motors 42a of the same kind, in other words for providing the drive for a drafting roller 522a. The inverter U1 serves to supply current for motors 42aa of the same kind, for driving other drafting rollers 522c. It is understood that in each case four drive motors 42a of the same kind are actuated in four drive blocks 540a, 540b, 540c, 540d in different segments 21, 21'. In the control unit 30 it is decided, in accordance with the spinning program for the spinning machine, whether all the control outputs on the left side of the control unit are to be subjected to current, or only individual ones, such as those which bring the contactors 342a and 342aa into the closed position. In this case, only the segment 21 at the top left in Fig. 1 of the spinning machine will be set in operation. The control unit is further provided in order to control a further inverter UA, which is connected via a further contactor to a motor M for driving the spindle drive shafts 11 a or the spindle drive belts 11 d respectively. The drive shaft 11 a or the drive belt 11 d<br><br>
are, as mentioned in connection with Fig. 1, is provided for driving the spindles, provided that each individual spinning position 11 does not have its own drive motor. In the latter case, the inverter UA would, for example, be capable of being connected to all the drive motors of the spinning position 11.<br>
In Fig. 3, a layout in principle of the control unit 30 is represented, by way of an example. The components 311 to 317 of the control unit are described hereinafter, which can be hardware control modules. With a modern control device, however, it is to the purpose for the control modules to be divided into individual software modules, or for the software to be written in such a way that this can at least in part replace the hardware modules. The operating data can be input via an input unit 311, for example as to whether the machine should be switched on as a whole, or only the segments 21 and/or 21 ' The input data is stored in a memory for control data. In addition, a program memory 314 is provided, which contains the general spinning program. The input data from the memory 312 or 314 respectively is processed in a computer unit 316. A segment selector unit 313 can be provided for separately, for the inputting or storage respectively of the operating mode of the machine, i.e. with the instruction as to which segment, 21 or 21', is to be switched on first. A control signal output unit 317 is connected to the control current output units 318, whereby several outputs to the corresponding control circuits are present, so that the segments 21 can be set in operation optionally. Arranged at the drafting rollers 522a etc. are monitoring sensors 522aa. This is intended to allow for the operation of the spinning machine to be monitored as a whole. The signals from the sensors are processed in a monitoring unit 315. In the event of a motor failing, this would be processed in a computer unit in such a way that the spinning program will be interrupted. However, if no signals are received by the sensor 522aa', with a specific operating mode, from a specific segment which is not to be activated, such as 21', this is in concordance with the operating mode selected, with the result that, by means of a logical linking of the output signals from the unit 315 and 313, the computer unit does not conclude that an error has occurred. In the output unit 317 only the output signal for the current circuit concerned, which leads to the segment 21 which is to be operated, is produced according to the program. Control current lines, 24 V, lead from the control current output units 318ff to the contactors, such as 432a,<br><br>
342aa, whereby in a specific operational situation only the drafting device motors 42a and 42aa for the segment 1 in the drive module 540a is provided with current.<br>
A spinning machine according to the invention can be characterized by the following features:<br>
Spinning machine with a drafting device 20 with several rollers 522a, 522b, 522c, to which several drive blocks 540a, 540b, 540c are allocated, whereby in each case a drafting device strand, consisting of part rollers 522a, 522b, 522c is allocated to a drive block 540a, which do not extend over the entire length of the spinning machine but only over a part section, and whereby a drive block exhibits at least one drive motor 42a or several drive motors 42a, 42aa, which is or are connected via one or more power transfer/gear blocks 42b, 41b" to roller sections 522a, 522c, and whereby the motors 42a, 42aa, 42a', 42aa' are in each case connected by a contactor 324a to a power supply, and whereby each contactor 342a is connected to a control signal line 319, and several control signal lines 319 are connected in particular to a control signal output unit 317 of a control unit 30, whereby the control unit 30, and in particular the control signal output unit, is designed in such a way that, optionally, only one single motor 42a or a group of motors 42a, 42aa, of a drive block 540a of the spinning machine can be switched on, so that only the individual segment 21 of the spinning machine which is allocated to the drive block 540a can be switched on in common, or also several drive blocks 540a, 540b, which are connected to several segments 21, 21' of the spinning machine, or all the drive blocks 40a, 540b, 540c, 540a', 540b', 540c'.<br>

The spinning machine can also be characterized in that sections of rollers or drafting rollers 522a, 522c of a drafting device 20 within a segment 21 of the spinning machine extend over a part length of the machine, in such a way that the part lengths of several segments 21, 2 V when put together correspond to the total length of the spinning machine, and whereby the roller sections 522a, 522a1, 522c, 522c1 are arranged in alignment for preference in the longitudinal direction of the spinning machine, but are not coupled to one another, so that a group of part rollers 522a, 522c can be switched on and off jointly, but independently of other part rollers 522a', 522c' of another segment 21' of the spinning machine.<br>
Spinning positions or spindles 11 may be provided which are arranged in considerable numbers for preference in the longitudinal direction of the spinning machine, whereby, for the drive of the spindles to which fibre material is being conducted via the drafting rollers 522a, 522b, 522c, either individual motors are provided, which are arranged co-axially with the spindles, or a shaft 11a mounted centrally in the spinning machine, on which vee-belt pulleys 11 b are located, which are connected by belts 11c to the spindles 11, or a tangential belt 11d is provided for, which is guided at least over a part length of the spinning machine, whereby the spindles 11 can be driven directly by the tangential belt 11d.<br>
