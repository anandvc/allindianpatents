				<td>CALL SETUP FOR IP/INTERNET TELEPHONY<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention generally relates to a method for providing a<br>
voice connection over an IP (Internet Protocol) network such as the<br>
Internet. In particular, the present invention relates to a method of<br>
automatic call setup and call alerting by utilizing distinctive ring patterns<br>
or caller ID information.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
One of the primary reasons for interest in offering IP/internet<br>
telephony services is the pricing structures currently in place for the data<br>
service, and voice service offered by telephone operators. Long distance<br>
voice service can be thought of as "demand data" service, where the user<br>
pays a premium for the instantaneous access to a 64Kbps channel (voice<br>
grade channel in the US). Widely publicized, promotional type pricing for<br>
this service is on the order of $.10 a minute. By contrast, data service<br>
offered by telephone operators, such as that offered for a T-1 connection<br>
(24 voice quality data lines, for a 1.544 Mbps connection) is priced at<br>
approximately $1000/month. which works out to $.001 a minute per<br>
voice line. In the very near future, cable operators will place extreme<br>
pressure on even the data service rates for telephone operators, as cable<br>
modems will allow cable operators to offer hundreds of Kbps effective<br>
throughput for approximately $50/month.<br>
IP telephony is also one of the first and most visible steps toward an<br>
Integrated Services Internet, which carries real time data, voice and<br>
video.<br>
The basic idea of IP/internet voice telephony is to digitize your<br>
voice as you talk on the phone and send the digitized data as IP<br>
packets to the Internet. An IP voice device can be embedded within<br>
an Internet connection device such as a modem, a set-top-box, or a<br>
computer. It can be also built as a stand alone product. The stand<br>
alone IP voice device, for example, may provide an Ethernet jack<br>
which can be connected with an Internet connection device and other<br>
LAN devices. The IP voice device may also include interfaces to<br>
connect regular phone handsets. The quality of speech heard through<br>
a normal telephone line requires 64kbits/s bandwidth. However, most<br>
current internet connections have less bandwidth, such as 28.8kBPS. or<br>
56kBPS modem. Furthermore, even if a fast connection device is used,<br>
such as an ISDN, or Cable Modem, the Internet network itself is a<br>
shared medium and has limited bandwidth. Therefore, audio codecs<br>
are usually embedded to compress the voice data.<br>
To guarantee the interoperability between IP voice devices from<br>
different vendors, International Telecommunications Union (ITU)<br>
developed H.323 as the standard for telephony over IP network.<br>
H.323 defines common procedures for call setup, data compression,<br>
and data transport.<br>
H.323 is an umbrella standard which references many other ITU<br>
recommendations. It provides various levels of multimedia<br>
communications. These levels include voice only, voice and video,<br>
voice and data, or voice, video, and data communications over a local<br>
area network. The voice only H.323 protocol stack includes RTP/RTCP.<br>
RAS/Q.931 (H.225.0). and H.245. RTP/RTCP is used for packetization<br>
and synchronization of voice data. RAS/Q.931 describes the call<br>
registration, admission, and status as well as call signalling. H.245<br>
defines the control messages and procedures.<br>
In a general sense, IP telephony can be thought of as providing a<br>
"virtual" point to point connection for voice services over Internet.<br>
Various IP telephony devices currently exist in the marketplace. Some<br>
examples include VocalTec® Internet Phone® Lite which is a software<br>
product to be used in a multimedia PC. made by Vocaltech Corporation<br>
of Northvale, NJ. Other examples of product include CoolTalk of<br>
Netscape or NetMeeting of Microsoft. Most of these software based<br>
products reside in a client server such as a PC or a network computer<br>
(NC) that require a microphone, speaker and a sound card. Other<br>
products comes in the form of a handset, which basically incorporates<br>
the function of the microphone and speaker in the software-based<br>
product.<br>
As an example of how to place a call, suppose a user in<br>
Indianapolis wants to call his friend in Paris. He would pick up his IP<br>
voice device handset (or a virtual handset on the computer screen) and<br>
hear a dial-tone like a regular telephone dial-tone. Then, he dials his<br>
friend's Paris phone number. The call travels over the Internet to a<br>
server provided by the IP telephony service provider. The server will<br>
connect the call to his friend's IP voice device and initiates the call. If<br>
 his friend has only a regular telephone, the server will connect the call<br>
to a gateway in Paris. The gateway in Paris then initiates a call over<br>
the public switched telephone network (PSTN) to the local Paris<br>
number.<br>
Depending on the Internet connections, there are basically two<br>
methods for making calls using an IP voice device: dial-up connections,<br>
and direct connections.<br>
With a dial-up connection, a user first calls an ISP (Internet service<br>
provider) over a regular dial-up line to set up an Internet connection.<br>
Then, he will use the IP voice device handset to dial the phone number of<br>
the person he is calling. With a direct or permanent connection, a user<br>
places a call using the IP voice device just as he does with the regular<br>
telephone. The direct connection indicates a permanent open channel to<br>
the Internet such as ISDN, or a cable access device. For dial-up<br>
connection call, a phone that has been called won't ring unless the<br>
Internet connection is already established for this phone. For direct<br>
connection call, a phone would ring like a normal telephone.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present applicants recognize that one problem of using dial-up<br>
connections for providing IP telephony is that the recipient or the callee<br>
of an internet call must be on-line waiting for the IP call. So, the sender<br>
(or the caller) will have to first call the recipient using a regular PSTN<br>
phone to make the appointment in advance so that the callee is already<br>
connected to the internet when the internet call arrives. This defeats the<br>
 purpose of eliminating the regular telephone call to save money and<br>
resources.<br>
Therefore a need has been recognized to provide a method which<br>
automatically sets up the Internet connection for the receiving IP voice<br>
device if it is off line. Accordingly, a method for setting up a voice call<br>
 over an IP network is described, comprising the steps of:<br>
initiating an IP voice call to a called device connected to a telephone<br>
line:<br>
 determining whether the called device is connected to the IP<br>
network; and<br>
initiating a telephone call with an associated telephone signal<br>
through the telephone line to the called device, in response to the<br>
called device being not connected to the IP network as determined<br>
the determining step.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
Fig. 1 is a block diagram of an exemplary system incorporating<br>
principles of the present invention.<br>
Fig. 2 is a flowchart illustrating a method of operation of the system<br>
shown in Fig. 1.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
In Fig. 1, there are two households 5 and 10 each with a respective<br>
Voice Over IP (VOIP) device 15 and 16. As discussed above, this device<br>
may be one of the many devices available on the market today. The<br>
VOIP devices 15 and 16 are each connected to a client server 17 or 18<br>
respectively which, for example, may be a PC or a network computer,<br>
serving as a client host for connection to the internet. As discussed above<br>
and readily recognized by one skilled in the art, the combination of a<br>
VOIP device 15 or 16 and a client server 17 or 18 may be replaced by a<br>
multi-media PC with a microphone, speaker, a sound card and an<br>
appropriate VOIP software.<br>
The client server 17 or 18 is each connected to the POTS (Plain Old<br>
Telephone Service) network or PSTN (Public Services Telephone Network)<br>
30 through dial-up telephone lines as discussed previously.<br>
An exemplary process of automatically setting up an internet call is<br>
shown in Fig. 2. As shown in Step 205 of Fig. 2. a caller in household 5<br>
first initiates a Voice over IP call to a callee in household 10. In the dial-<br>
up configuration of Fig. 1, the client server 17 will have to first be<br>
connected to the internet 40. One exemplary way the client server 17 can<br>
be connected to the internet 40 is by the caller mannually calling his or<br>
her ISP provider 35 using a modem (not shown) in the client server 17.<br>
This process of connecting to the ISP provider may also be automated by<br>
the client server software in response to the calling VOIP device 15<br>
initiating an internet call.<br>
Once the caller is on the internet through the ISP provider, he can<br>
then request a Voice over IP connection to a particular device on the<br>
internet. The caller can do that by providing an IP address of the callee<br>
he or she wishes to make an internet telephone connection to. This<br>
callee's IP address is first transmitted to the proxy server 37 of the ISP<br>
35. The proxy server 37 will then attempt to make an IP connection to<br>
the callee's VOIP device, for example, 16 in household 10. The proxy<br>
server 37 will attempt to make this connect by first making a connection<br>
to the far end proxy server, for example, proxy server 38. serving the<br>
callee "s VOIP device 16 and the associated client server 18 in household<br>
10.<br>
As shown in Step 210, when the VOIP call reaches the proxy server<br>
38 serving the called IP device 18, the proxy server 38 is able to<br>
determine the on-line status of the destination client server 18, since the<br>
proxy server 38 is aware of the on-line status of all units it is serving. At<br>
Steps 215 and 216, if the called client device 18 is already on-line, the<br>
proxy server 18 will proceed with the VOIP call connection between the<br>
source and destination client servers 17 and 18. The destination client<br>
server 18 will then generate a special IP ring or signal to alert the callee<br>
that an IP phone call is coming.<br>
If the client server 18 is off-line as determined by Step 215, the<br>
proxy server 38 will send a message back to the caller indicating the lack<br>
of immediate availability of the client server 18 and optionally may<br>
prompt the caller for an estimated waiting time for establishing the<br>
connection, as shown in Step 220. Next, the server initiates a call to the<br>
callee over PSTN 30. This will generate a special signal as to be described<br>
below in detail to the receiving client server device 18 and the recipient<br>
regular telephones. This signal will be recognized as an Internet call<br>
setup signal instead of a regular telephone ring signal. After the client<br>
server device 18 recognizes this call setup signal, it will dial up ISP 40 to<br>
set up the Internet connection. When the Internet connection is<br>
successfully set up, the receiving client server device 18 will send an<br>
acknowledge message to the proxy server 37 and a communication<br>
channel will be set up between the caller and callee. If after some<br>
specified time, the calling client 17 server has not received an<br>
acknowledgement indicating that the called device 16 or 18 is available,<br>
the calling client server 17 will advise the caller to use a normal<br>
telephone call.<br>
There are at least two approaches for a client server device to<br>
recognize an internet phone call from the proxy server 38 as discussed<br>
above.<br>
One exemplary method utilizes the distinct telephone ring patterns<br>
for a secondary line such as "teen line", as shown in Step 220. A<br>
secondary line such as "teen line" has a unique phone number but shares<br>
the same physical line with the main phone number. The ring patterns<br>
for the secondary line and primary line are different. The different ring<br>
patterns are usually used to distinguish between incoming calls intended<br>
for different recipients at one location, e.g., between a call intended for a<br>
parent and a call intended for a child. In this method, the proxy server<br>
38 dials the destination device 18 using a "teen line" number. The client<br>
server device 18 then recognizes the regular telephone call from the<br>
proxy server through the PSTN by detecting the special "teen line" ring<br>
pattern, as in Step 221. If the ring signal is a "teen line" ring, the client<br>
server device 18 will discontinue the call and dial up the ISP 38 to set up<br>
the internet connection in Step 222. The IP phone call can then be<br>
started, as in Step 223.<br>
If, on the other hand, the ring signal is a regular ring, the client<br>
server 18 will ignore it and it will keep ringing the regular telephone. It<br>
should be understood that the user should not pick up a phone when the<br>
ring is a "teen line" ring as doing so may interfere with completion of the<br>
IP phone call.<br>
Another exemplary method of a client server recognizing an<br>
internet phone call utilizes Caller ID information, such as type 1 Caller ID<br>
information. Type 1 caller ID information is transmitted during the<br>
ringing, off-hook stage of a regular telephone call.<br>
According to this exemplary method, a special phone number is assigned<br>
to proxy server 38. As shown in step 225, when the proxy server 38<br>
dials the destination device 18 to alert the callee of an incoming VOIP call<br>
the specially assigned phone number is sent as type 1 Caller ID<br>
information. By decoding the Caller ID information at step 226. the<br>
destination client server 18 can recognize the incoming call from the<br>
proxy server 38. The operations after the call recognition are shown in<br>
Fig. 2 as steps 227 and 228 and are the same as described for the first<br>
exemplary method described above. It should be understood that the<br>
user should not pick up a phone when it rings the first time, as doing so<br>
may interfere with reception and recognition of the caller ID information.<br>
This limitation is a normal requirement for use of type 1 Caller ID<br>
information.<br>
It is to be understood that the embodiments and variations shown<br>
and described herein are illustrations only and that various modifications<br>
may be implemented by those skilled in the art without departing from<br>
the scope and spirit of the invention.<br>
