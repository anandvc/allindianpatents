The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
WO 2005/088864	PCT/US2005/007114<br>
MULTI-ANTENNA RECEIVE DIVERSITY CONTROL IN WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS<br>
Claim of Priority under 35 U.S.C. §119<br>
[0001]	The present Application for Patent claims priority to Provisional Application<br>
No. 60/550,756 entitled "METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR RECEIVER DIVERSITY CONTROL IN WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS" filed March 5, 2004, and to Provisional Application No. 60/583,902 entitled "METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR RECEIVER DIVERSITY CONTROL IN WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS" filed June 28,2004, assigned to the assignee hereof and hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Field<br>
[0002]	The present invention relates generally to wireless communications and more<br>
specifically to multi-antenna receive diversity in a wireless communication system.<br>
Background<br>
[0003]	Mobile multi-antenna receive diversity refers to the use of multiple receivers in a<br>
wireless communications device. A different antenna provides input to each individual receiver, thereby providing diversity to the communications link. The diversity improves call and data transmission quality and also increases the network capacity. The multiple antennas provide spatial diversity as each multipath appears differently at each antenna. Therefore, the effects of multipath fading are not strongly correlated among the receivers. The outputs of the multiple receiver chains are combined in order to provide a better estimation of the symbols prior to decoding. Combination methods known in the art include, but are not limited to, Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE) combining, maximal-ratio combining, equal-gain combining, and selection combining. The main drawback of mobile receive diversity is that each receiver chain expends power, particularly in the Radio Frequency (RF) and analog portions of the chain.<br>
[0004]	Studies have shown multi-antenna receive diversity increases the forward link<br>
capacity significantly. The capacity increase may be capitalized as higher throughput,<br><br>
WO 2005/088864	PCT/US2005/007114<br>
lower base station transmit power, lower Frame Error Rate (FER), or a combination of<br>
thereof.    One drawback of multi-antenna receive diversity is the power cost of<br>
implementing and operating such receivers. In addition, the benefits of multi-antenna<br>
receive diversity may not always be utilized or even needed.<br>
[0005]	There is a need, therefore, to control when receive diversity is used and when it<br>
is not used. There is a need in the art for control methods and apparatuses to use mobile diversity when the benefits of greater link capacity, higher throughput, lower transmit power, lower error rate, etc. are required, and not to use mobile diversity when the benefits do not justify the higher power cost. Furthermore, there is a need to control the diversity to optimize the tradeoff between multiple multi-antenna receive diversity and power consumption in a wireless communications device.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0006]	A mobile device comprises a receiver unit that has at least two receivers to<br>
implement multi-antenna receive diversity. A control unit, coupled to control the receivers, estimates, at the mobile, an amount of utilization by a traffic channel of the mobile of total transmission power capacity at a base station. The mobile controls application of multi-antenna receive diversity in the mobile device based on the power capacity utilization. In one embodiment, the mobile estimates an amount of power a network is transmitting to the mobile relative to a reference, such as a pilot. In other embodiments, indicators, based on quality of the traffic channel between the mobile and the network, capacity limiting resources, a number of sectors in soft hand-off in a wireless system, etc., are used to control application of multi-antenna receive diversity in a mobile device.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0014]	FIG. 1 is an example of a wireless communications network 100 in which multi-<br>
antenna receive diversity may be used. A Mobile Station (MS) 110, which may be mobile or stationary, may communicate with one or more Base Stations (BSs) 120. A mobile station 110, referred herein as "mobile," transmits and receives voice or data or both through one or more BSs 120 connected to a Base Station Controller (BSC) 130. BSs 120 and BSCs 130 are parts of a network called an Access Network (AN). BSC 130 connects to wireline network 140, which may include any of a variety of circuit technologies. The access network transports voice or data to and between BSs 120. The access network may be further connected to additional networks outside the access network, such as a wired telephone system, a corporate intranet, or the Internet which constitute parts of the Wireline Network 140. The access network may transport voice and data between each access mobile 110 and such outside networks. A mobile 110 that has established an active traffic channel connection with one or more base stations 120 is called an active mobile station, and is said to be in a traffic state. A mobile 110 that is in the process of establishing an active traffic channel connection with one or more base stations 120 is said to be in a connection setup state. The communication link through which the MS 110 sends signals to the BS 120 is called the Reverse Link (RL) 150. The communication link through which a Base Station sends signals to a mobile station is called the Forward Link (FL) 160.<br>
[0015]	Multi-antenna receive diversity may increase the forward link capacity of a<br>
wireless communications system significantly. While multi-antenna receive diversity incurs overhead costs, the operating environment of the wireless system may realize a benefit of multi-antenna receive diversity operation over simply operating a single receiver chain. To balance the goals of reduced power usage while taking advantage of the benefits of multi-antenna receive diversity in such environments, it is desirable to<br><br>
WO 2005/088864	5	PCT/US2005/007114<br>
control multi-antenna receive diversity operation in a mobile 110. Multi-antenna receive diversity control would operate to turn off the diversity when it offers little benefit, and thereby save power, and turn on the diversity when it would be beneficial.<br>
0016]	The presently described embodiments include methods and apparatuses for<br>
controlling the application of multi-antenna receive diversity for the purpose of power savings while retaining the benefits of diversity when needed. Multi-antenna receive diversity is controlled in response to operating conditions, transmission requirements, and user settings, among other criteria. The specific conditions) to trigger a switch in diversity operation may depend on the standard specification^) and protocol(s) under which the MS is operating as described herein.<br>
[0017]	The methods described herein for controlling MS multi-antenna receive<br>
diversity are applicable to any wireless communication system, using various multiple access schemes, such as, but not limited to, Code Division-Multiple Access (CDMA), Frequency Division-Multiple Access (FDMA), Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) or Time Division-Multiple Access (TDMA). Examples of CDMA multiple access schemes include but are not limited to systems supporting standard protocols, such as TIA/EIA/IS-95, TIA/EIA/IS-2000 or cdma2000, 1xEV-DO, 1xEV-DV, and WCDMA. The embodiments described herein may be used in any wireless system having two or more operational receivers (i.e., one receiver plus one or more diversity receivers, in the mobile station for a given communication scheme).<br>
[0018]	FIG. 2 is a diagram of a portion of the mobile 110 with two or more antennas<br>
and two or more receivers, as illustrated in FIG. 1. Where specific embodiments described herein are described with respect to a degree of diversity of two, {i.e., two antennas, two receivers, or two receiver chains), such embodiments are described for clarity and are not meant to preclude other degrees of diversity. The invention described herein applies to multi-antenna receive diversity with two or greater antennas, two or greater receivers, or two or greater receiver chains. In this disclosure the term "primary receiver" is used to indicate the main receiver chain, as well as portions of a receiver chain in use for receive operations, whether multi-antenna receive diversity is in use at the time or not. The term "diversity receiver" indicates an additional receiver, receiver chain, or portions of an additional receiver chain, which provide diversity when multi-antenna receive diversity is operational. Therefore, a communications device with a degree of diversity of two has one primary receiver plus one diversity receiver.<br><br>
WO 2005/088864	PCT/US2005/007114<br>
Furthermore, the primary receiver, the diversity receiver chain, or portions of the diversity receiver chain may be integrated into a single chip, or distributed over multiple chips. Also, the primary receiver, the diversity receiver chain, or portions of the diversity receiver chain may be integrated into a chip along with other functions of the wireless device.<br>
[0019]	In one embodiment, illustrated in FIG. 2, primary receiver 210 and diversity<br>
receivers 220-240 provide input to Demodulator/Combiner 250. Primary receiver 210 may include the RF analog front end portions of the receiver, as well as other functions and operations, including RF processing, analog, demodulation, decoding, and other receiver tasks in any combination, demodulator/combiner 250 combines the outputs of primary receiver 210 and any or all of diversity receivers 220-240 and provides output symbols for decoder 260. Note, when multi-antenna receive diversity is disabled, primary receiver 210 continues to provide outputs to demodulator/combiner 250. Decoder 260 converts the symbols into bits. The bits are provided to the Data Sink/Application 280. Diversity control unit 270 receives indicators from the outputs of demodulator/combiner 250 or decoder 260 or both. Diversity control unit 270 also receives other indicators that will be described below. Diversity control unit 270 as shown in the embodiment of FIG. 2 uses both symbols and bits to determine whether to turn multi-antenna receive diversity on or off. Further, diversity control unit 270 uses various other operating conditions and settings separately or in combination. Diversity control unit 270 outputs control signal(s) 295 to diversity receivers 220-240 to control their respective operation. Control signal(s) 295 may be single or multiple signals. Furthermore, control signal(s) 295 maybe separate signals to each of diversity receivers 220-240, or may be common signals to all diversity receivers 220-240. Control signal(s) 295 may also be multiplexed, encoded, or formatted using various techniques known in the art.<br>
[0020]	In one embodiment, a timer or clock 272 may be used to implement a time<br>
period for diversity operation. The timer 272 may initiate when diversity control is enabled and remain on for a predetermined or dynamically determined time period, after which diversity control is disabled. Note, the timer may be implemented to track diversity control for optimization of the diversity control process. In such a way, the timer 272 would allow the diversity control unit 270 to store the diversity control scenarios of operation, allowing the diversity control unit 270 to predict future<br><br>
WO 2005/088864<br><br>
7<br><br>
PC17US2005/007114<br><br>
operation. For example, the timing information may allow the diversity control unit 270 to adjust the time period after which diversity is disabled.<br>
[0021]	In one embodiment, diversity control unit 270 includes a first estimator, referred<br>
to as a load on network capacity estimator 274, and a second estimator, referred to as a capacity usage estimator 276. The diversity control unit 270 further includes control means 278 which controls operation of at least one diversity receiver, such as diversity receivers 220, 230, 240 in response to the first and second estimators 274 and 276, respectively. One embodiment includes a loading estimator 500, detailed in FIG. 4. Estimator 500 provides an indication of the portion of capacity used by a given mobile station, in the context of the loading condition of the network. Such estimation is then used for making MRD control decisions.<br>
[0022]	Alternate embodiments may employ more or less estimators to estimate any of a<br>
variety of operational parameters, including, but not limited to, network and/or wireless apparatus (e.g. MS 10) parameters.<br>
Overview of Multi-Antenna Receive Diversity Considerations:<br>
[0023]	The techniques described herein use one or more indicators to determine<br>
whether to turn on or turn off multi-antenna receive diversity. FIG. 3 is a high-level block diagram illustrating multi-antenna receive diversity considerations. Multi-antenna receive diversity control 300 receives one or more indicators from network capacity indicators) 310, quality (e.g., user experience) indicators 320, and/or mobile battery level indicator(s) 330. In some embodiments, network capacity indicators) 310 are used to control application of multi-antenna receive diversity. In some embodiments, quality indicators) 320, also referred to as user experience, are used to control application of multi-antenna receive diversity. In some embodiments, other considerations, such as mobile battery level indicators) 330, are used. In yet other embodiments, various combinations of quality, network capacity, battery level in the mobile and other indicators may be used.<br>
[0024]	In general, in determining whether to apply multi-antenna receive diversity, two<br>
network capacity parameters are considered. One parameter identifies the total amount of resources allocated by the network, and a second parameter identifies the mobile's utilization of the network resources. If the network is not experiencing a high load on the network resources (e.g., transmission power), then the network has resources to<br><br>
WO 2005/088864	PCT/US2005/007114<br>
allocate more power to the user. As a result, the system may decide to turn off multi-antenna receive diversity. As a second network capacity consideration, the mobile may turn on multi-antenna receive diversity if the mobile is using a large amount of available capacity. If the mobile is only using a small amount of the network's available capacity, then th	e system may decide to turn off multi-antenna receive diversity. In one embodiment of a wireless system, transmitting voice, both network resource load and mobile utilization of network resources are used to control multi-antenna receive diversity. Thus, if a mobile is using a large amount of network capacity, the system may benefit from application of multi-antenna receive diversity.<br>
Network Capacity Indicators To Control Multi-Antenna Receive Diversity:<br>
[0025]	In one embodiment, the mobile estimates the amount of load on the network<br>
resources. The estimate of load on network capacity may be expressed as:<br><br>
wherein, Ior represents the total transmitted energy per chip from a given base station for all channels transmitting from the base station, such as BS 120; wherein such total is a sum of energy from the pilot channel, all traffic channels, etc; and wherein Ecp represents energy per chip of the pilot channel. The MS 110 also estimates capacity usage by the mobile. The estimation of capacity usage by the MS 110, i.e., the portion of transmitted power directed to a given mobile station, may be expressed as:<br><br>
wherein, lor, as above, represents the total transmitted energy per chip for all channels transmitting from the base station; and wherein ECT represents energy per chip of the traffic channel for a given mobile station. The To evaluate both the load on network capacity and capacity usage by the mobile, the mobile estimates:<br><br>
In one embodiment, the mobile weights each of the estimates to obtain:<br><br><br>
WO 2005/088864	PCT/US2005/007114<br>
wherein, ai represents the weight parameter for the estimate of load on network capacity, and 012 represents the weight parameter for capacity usage by the mobile. The formula is again shown in the decibel representation. Various metrics may be applied to generate the weight parameters, ai and a.2. The weight parameters may be adjusted in coordination with system design, priorities, and/or operation of the system. In one embodiment, both estimates are weighted equally (i.e., 04 = ai) to obtain:<br><br>
The estimation of traffic-to-pilot power ratio, i.e., estimation of ECT/ECP, is illustrated i FIG. 4, detailed here in below. A large value of IOR/ECP indicates a large network load i.e., many mobile stations each with a traffic channel capacity ECT contributes to a large IOR; and a large value of ECT/IOR indicates the given mobile is consuming a large portion of the capacity. There is a desire to use Multi-antenna Receive Diversity control mechanisms to enable diversity when the mobile station is consuming a large portion c capacity, i.e., ECT/IOR is large, unless the network loading is light, i.e., IOR/ECP is small in which case it may not be a concern for a given mobile station to consume a large portion of capacity. As detailed with respect to FIG. 4, a convenient way to evaluate th loading conditions is to combine the metrics as follows:<br><br>
[0026]	One embodiment incorporates an estimate of forward power utilization. In this<br>
embodiment, the mobile estimates a proportion of power allocated to a forward link data channel targeted to MS 110. The estimate of forward link power may be referenced to the total forward link power, which may consider only power allocated to the specific mobile station, such as MS 110 in the present example, or may include measures of power to other mobile stations. The power calculation may be referenced to a known reference signal. A diversity control algorithm may then turn on diversity when a metric exceeds a given threshold and turn off diversity when the metric falls below a given threshold.<br>
[0027]	In one embodiment, the system calculates an estimate of the ratio of energy-of-<br>
traffic to energy-of-pilot. The energy-of-traffic to energy-of-pilot ratio measures the power the network is transmitting ito the mobile (ECT) relative to a reference, the pilot (Eq,). In general, the energy-of-traffic to energy-of-pilot ratio estimates, at the mobile,<br><br>
WO 2005/088864	PCT/US2005/007114<br>
the power the network is allocating to the mobile. In one embodiment, the energy energy-of-traffic to energy-of-pilot ratio is calculated based on estimates from Power Control Bits (PCBs). The traffic-to-pilot energy ratio, as measured from the power control forward link, may be expressed as:<br><br>
wherein:<br>
Ecr is an estimate of the energy per chip for traffic for a given mobile station;<br>
and<br>
Ecp is an estimate of the energy per chip of the pilot channel.<br>
[0028]	M one embodiment, the traffic-to-pilot energy ratio is estimated from a power<br>
control sub channel on the forward link. The power control bits are not buried in noise, and thus are suitable for this estimation. The power control bit magnitude is estimated by standard techniques {e.g., despread and accumulate in CDMA). In a system with 16 power control bits per traffic channel frame (e.g., cdma2000), the traffic-to-pilot energy ratio may be estimated as a summation as follows.<br><br>
            In one embodiment, samples from sixteen (16) power control bits are acquired every 20<br>
            milliseconds to acquire the sum of estimates.<br>
[0029]	FIG. 4 is a block diagram illustrating one embodiment of at least one estimator<br>
500 included within diversity controller 270 of FIG. 2. The inputs to estimator 500 coming from demodulator/combiner 250. The estimator 500 for estimating energy-of-traffic to energy-of-pilot ratio. In one embodiment, the weighted pilot magnitude, extracted from a digital signal processor in the MS or mobile device, is used to estimate the energy-of-traffic to energy-of-pilot ratio. The weighted pilot magnitude is the mean magnitude, not energy, of the punctured forward power control sub channel. The weighted traffic bit magnitude, EBT is accumulated in register 510, and the weighted pilot magnitude, ECP, is accumulated in register 515 every 20 ms frame. The weighted traffic bit magnitudes are rescaled to convert the Power Control Bit (PCB) magnitude to<br><br>
WO 2005/088864	PCT/US2005/007114<br>
11<br>
	the equivalent Forward Control Channel (FCH), ECT magnitude. In other words, Bit<br>
            Scale 512 converts the bit magnitude EBT to the same units as ECT- The scaling accounts<br>
             for the PCB length (e.g., 128 chips in cdma2000) and the ratio of the chip energies of<br>
           the power control sub channel and the FCH. As shown in FIG. 4, the 16 bit integer, EBT<br>
               is input to multiplier 520 for conversion to a 32 bit Q12 integer. The 16 bit integer, Ecp,<br>
           is input to summer 530 with a one, so as to avoid division by zero when calculating the<br>
          ratio. A magnitude ratio of the FCH to pilot is generated from the scaled values, in<br>
        divider 540, and then converted to a 16 bit unsigned Q12 integer in block 550. This<br>
        value is squared, in calculation unit 560, to produce the power ratio as a 32 bit unsigned<br>
        Q24 integer. The 32 bit unsigned Q24 integer representation supports ECT/ECP ratios<br>
          from -72dB to +24 dB. However, resolution may be degraded at the lower end of that<br>
       range.<br>
[0030]      In another embodiment, the system calculates, as at least a partial indicator to<br>
decide whether to turn on or turn off multi-antenna receive diversity, another estimate of the energy-of-traffic to energy-of-pilot ratio. For this embodiment, the system estimates a ratio of energy-of-noise to energy-of-pilot. In one implementation, the estimate ratio of energy-of-noise to energy-of-pilot is multiplied by a constant, T_fixed. For this embodiment, the indicator may be expressed as:<br><br>
wherein, NT is an estimate of the received noise per chip; Eq, is an estimate of th energy per chip for pilot; and T_fixed is a constant. The value, TjBxed, scales the ratio and may comprise any predetermined constant. In one embodiment, T_fixed comprise a scale based on the data rate of the traffic channel. In one implementation, T_fixed i<br><br><br>

           transmit power of the mobile and base station in order to meet target performance criteria under varying operating conditions, while providing for increased network capacity. In another implementation to estimate a ratio of energy-of-noise to energy-of-pilot, the mobile calculates an estimate of the fast forward power control setpoint. For this embodiment, the indicator may be expressed as:<br><br><br><br>
WO 2005/088864	PCT/US2005/007114<br>
wherein, T-_adapt, estimated by —-, represents the target value for the signal-to-noise<br>
N<br>
T<br>
ratio of the fast forward power control setpoint. In one embodiment, T_-adapt is estimated from the power control outer loop for a particular FER. The outer loop power control setpoint is typically given as energy per bit per noise energy, Eb/No. The Eb/No provides a target at the receiver to meet the FER requirements. A larger value of the forward link power control setpoint indicates the mobile requires a higher Eb/No to achieve the target FER from the inner power control loop. The mobile may benefit from multi-antenna receive diversity in such cases because combining two or more receive chains reduces the amount of required Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) at the receiver.<br>
[0032]	The scaled ratio of noise to pilot is an estimate, by the mobile, of traffic power<br>
the mobile calculates to receive from the network. Thus, the ratio of energy-of-noise to energy-of-pilot measures whether the mobile requires a small or a large portion of power from the network. If the mobile does not require a large portion of forward link power allocation from the network, the mobile may decide not to turn on multi-antenna receive diversity. Accordingly, the scaled ratio of energy-of-noise to energy-of-pilot may be used as an indicator to turn on or turn off multi-antenna receive diversity based on the assumption that the forward power control inner loop has converged.<br>
[0033]	In another embodiment, an additional energy metric is generated and analyzed to<br>
decide whether to turn on or turn off multi-antenna receive diversity. FIG. 5 is a block diagram illustrating generation of one energy metric used to control multi-antenna receive diversity. For this embodiment, a frame is decoded, and bits are extracted over a twenty (20) millisecond period. The bits are a digital representation of a sequence of input symbols. For the embodiment of FIG S, bits are decoded in symbol decoder 600. The bits are then re-coded into a frame by symbol decoder 610. The signal from the re-coded frame represents a signal absence of noise, assuming the frame was decoded properly. The re-coded bits are correlated with the original received symbols to provide an energy metric estimate in symbol comparison unit 620. The difference between the start and end signals is indicative of channel quality. For example, a large difference between the start and end signals signifies poor channel quality. Conversely, a small difference between the signals indicates good signal quality.<br><br>

0034]	The symbol comparison yields an estimate of energy per symbol. The energy<br>
per symbol estimate is proportional to energy per chip, ECT- The energy per symbol is weighted accordingly to generate an estimate for the energy per chip. A threshold is applied to the ECT estimate in order to generate at least a partial indicator to turn on or turn off multi-antenna receive diversity at threshold/control unit 630.<br>
[0035]	In one embodiment, blocks 600,610, and 620 are configured within decoder 260<br>
illustrated in FIG. 2. Alternate embodiments may configure such blocks alternately within the mobile station or mobile device to perform the same functions. In one embodiment, threshold/control 630 is configured within diversity control unit 270. Alternate embodiments may employ alternate configurations.<br>
Soft Hand-off Sectors Indicator^ for Multi-Antenna Receive Diversity Control:<br>
[0036]	In another embodiment, the system measures the number of sectors in a soft<br>
hand-off as an indicator to decide whether to turn on or turn off multi-antenna receive diversity. In general, a greater number of sectors used in soft hand-off indicates a greater use of network resources. In turn, the amount of network resources allocated to the mobile may be used to decide whether to turn on or turn off multi-antenna receive diversity. The indicator may be calculated as:<br><br>
Err<br>
wherein, N represents the number of sectors in a soft handoff, —£L represents an<br>
ECP<br>
estimate of the energy-of-traffic to energy-of-pilot ratio, F1is a filter that filters the soft handoff weighted traffic-to-pilot ratio —&amp;-N, and F2 is a filter that filters the number of<br>

wherein, N represents the number of sectors in a soft handoff, ■jL-*(T_adapt)*N<br>
represents the estimate ratio of energy-of-noise to energy-of-pilot multiplied by the variables, T_adapt and N, Fj is a filter that filters the soft handoff weighted traffic-to-<br>
sectors in a soft handoff to yield a long term average soft handoff size. Generally, F2<br>
has a longer time constant than F1<br>
[0037]	In another embodiment, the indicator may be calculated as:<br><br>

soft handoff to yield a long term average soft handoff size. In one embodiment, filtering is performed by diversity control unit 270 illustrated in FIG. 2. Note, in a CDMA system, such as one supporting IS-95 or cdma2000, the number of sectors is directly communicated to the mobile station in handoff information messages. Each sector in the Active set is transmitting to the mobile station. The mobile station uses the handoff information to receive the various signals.<br>
Network Capacity Limitations As Indicator(s') For Multi-Antenna Receive Diversity:<br>
[0038]	One advantage of multi-antenna receive diversity is mat it decreases the forward<br>
link power. However, at a certain point, a further decrease in forward link power does not increase capacity and quality of the system due to a limitation imposed by the modulation degrees of freedom in the system. In general, the number of degrees of freedom per second measures the number of orthogonal signals or bases a system may transmit every second. In cdma2000, the number of degrees of freedom for a channel is based on allocation of Walsh codes. Similarly, these techniques apply to other systems, which allocate orthogonal bases resources to users (e.g., orthogonal variable spreading codes for Wideband CDMA (WCDMA).<br>
[0039]	If the system is using resources to allocate orthogonal bases to mobiles (e.g.,<br>
Walsh codes), then the orthogonal bases utilization may be a limitation of the capacity of the system. In one embodiment, the system uses the utilization of orthogonal bases to determine a threshold to turn off multi-antenna receive diversity.. For example, in cdma2000, when the portion of the Walsh resource allocated from the network Walsh resource pool exceeds the portion of traffic energy, ECT, allocated from the network power resource, multi-antenna receive diversity is turned off. Thus, for this embodiment, the Walsh utilization is used to adjust the target threshold of minimum forward link power to turn off multi-antenna receive diversity.<br>
Quality fcidicator(s') To Control Multi-Antenna Receive Diversity:<br><br>
WO 2005/088864	PCT/US2005/007114<br>
[0040]	In some embodiments, application of multi-antenna receive diversity control is<br>
based on quality of the traffic connection between a mobile and one or more base stations.<br>
[0041]	One quality indicator is the FER of a forward link traffic channel. When the<br>
number of errors passes a threshold within a certain time window, the multi-antenna receive diversity may be turned on for a specified amount of time or until the FER goes below an acceptable threshold. The control of multi-antenna receive diversity may be implemented dynamically to achieve a desired FER. Alternatively, the FER target may be fixed. When the target FER exceeds a threshold, multi-antenna receive diversity may be turned on. Any filtering, averaging, or smoothing method may be implemented to control application of multi-antenna receive diversity.<br>
[0042]	In one embodiment, application of multi-antenna receive diversity is based on a<br>
number of successive frame errors. For this embodiment, if the mobile detects a predetermined number of successive frame errors, multi-antenna receive diversity is turned on. The predetermined number of frames may coincide with other thresholds set by the system. For example, if the system turns off the transmitter after a predetermined successive number of frame errors (e.g., 12 frames), the mobile may turn on multi-antenna receive diversity after a successive number of frame errors less than 12 (e.g., 6 frames) in an attempt to maintain the call. Alternatively, rather than considering successive frame errors, the short term FER may be used as an indicator. In this case a filter is applied with the individual frame errors as inputs, providing an estimate of the FER over the duration given by the filter time constant. If the FER exceeds a threshold, then multi-antenna receive diversity will be turned on.<br>
[0043]	Once multi-antenna receive diversity is turned on, due to an inadequate FER, it<br>
may be turned off by a variety of means. In one embodiment, multi-antenna receive diversity remains on for a period of time, after which multi-antenna receive diversity is turned off. In an alternate embodiment, multi-antenna receive diversity is turned off based on a given criteria, such as FER below a "turn off' threshold. Note, using an FER indicator for other channels may result in different threshold values, as each channel may have a different acceptable FER.<br>
[0044]	In some embodiments, control of multi-antenna receive diversity is based on the<br>
"state" of the connection between the mobile and one or more base stations. In some embodiments, multi-antenna receive diversity is turned on when the mobile is in an<br><br>
WO 2005/088864	PCT/US2005/007114<br>
16<br>
access state with a base station.  Multi-antenna receive diversity is applied until the<br>
mobile is connected to the base station.   In one implementation, the mobile uses the<br>
protocol state to determine if the mobile is connected with abase station.<br>
[0045]	Other quality indicators, such as symbol error rate, may be used to control<br>
application of multi-antenna receive diversity.<br>
Turning Off Multi-Antenna Receive Diversity:<br>
[0046]	When multi-antenna receive diversity is turned off, the amount of forward link<br>
power required at the mobile is increased. An abrupt turn off of multi-antenna receive diversity may result in degradation of the quality of the forward link. To maintain quality of service, in one embodiment, the system executes a procedure to turn off multi-antenna receive diversity. FIG. 6 is a flow diagram illustrating one embodiment for turning off multi-antenna receive diversity. For this embodiment, the setpoint for power control is adjusted prior to turning off multi-antenna receive diversity. Specifically, the power set point is increased in the mobile when the control indicates turning off multi-antenna receive diversity (blocks 700 and 710, FIG. 6). Specifically, for a turn-off decision, the power control setpoint in the MS is incremented at block 710. In turn, the mobile sends a control power command to the base station to increase power in the forward link (block 720, FIG. 6). As a result of the turn-up power command, the base station increases the forward link power, and multi-antenna receive diversity is subsequently turned off (blocks 730 and 740, FIG. 6). The method checks if one frame elapsed, block 730, and if so, turns off multi-antenna reception, block 740. When the mobile turns off multi-antenna receive diversity, the level of the forward link power is at an adequate level so that performance is not degraded, and the setpoint is restored to its previous value.<br>
Procedure for Applying Multi-Antenna Receive Diversity:<br>
[0047]	The multi-antenna receive diversity wireless system may use any one indicator,<br>
or a combination of one or more indicators, to decide whether to turn on or turn off multi-antenna receive diversity. For example, in one embodiment, Hie system selects the minimum of (1) the scaled ratio of energy-of-noise to energy-of-pilot or (2) the filtered ratio of energy-of-traffic to energy-of-pilot to turn off multi-antenna receive diversity.   Each parameter potentially provides a threshold to turn off multi-antenna<br><br>
WO 2005/088864	PCT/US2005/007114<br>
receive diversity. For example, the ratio of energy-of-traffic to energy-of-pilot measures power allocation from the perspective of the base station. If the base station will not substantially benefit from a decrease in forward link power, as indicated by the ratio of energy-of-noise to energy-of-pilot, then the advantage of operating multi-antenna receive diversity is reduced, and multi-antenna receive diversity is turned off.<br>
[0048]	FIG. 7 illustrates a state diagram for one embodiment to dynamically control<br>
application of multi-antenna receive diversity. In one embodiment, the state machine is clocked every 20 milliseconds (frame). The two primary conditions for operation of the state machine are capacity of the system and quality of the transmission. The state machine of FIG. 7 describes operation of multi-antenna receive diversity control for forward traffic estimates only. Multi-antenna receive diversity is on in the following states of FIG. 7: RD_ONCT 1110, RD_ONQT 1130, RD_FON 1160, RD_ON 1115. Multi-antenna receive diversity is off in the following remaining states: RD_POFF 1120, RD_FOFF 1135, RD_OFFT 1125, RDJEOFF 1105.<br>
[0049]	The initial state, at 1105, is referred to as multi-antenna receive diversity enabled<br>
off (RDJEOFF). If a test for network capacity is true (i.e., capacity metrics are greater than a threshold to turn on multi-antenna receive diversity) then the state machine transitions to the multi-antenna receive diversity on capacity timer state (RD_ONCT) at 1110 as indicated by transition arrow "A." m the multi-antenna receive diversity on capacity timer state 1110, multi-antenna receive diversity is turned on, and a capacity timer is set. If the capacity timer expires and a test for traffic quality is true (i.e., quality metrics are less than a threshold to turn on multi-antenna receive diversity) then the -state machine transitions to the multi-antenna receive diversity on state (RD_ON) at 1115 (transition arrow "B").<br>
[0050]	la the multi-antenna receive diversity on state 1115, the control unit tests for<br>
capacity thresholds. If both the capacity and the quality tests do not motivate application of multi-antenna receive diversity, then the state machine transitions from the RD_ON state 1115 to a prepare to turn off multi-antenna receive diversity (RD_POFF) state (1120) (transition arrow "C"). The control unit, when in the RDJPOFF state 1120, adjusts the forward power control setpoint. The state machine remains in the RDJPOFF state 1120 for one state machine cycle (e.g., one frame). After one state machine cycle, if the quahty test does not indicate application of multi-antenna receive diversity, then the state machine transitions from the RD_POFF state<br><br>
WO 2005/088864	18	PCT/US2005/007H4<br>
1120 to a multi-antenna receive diversity off timer state (RD_OFFT) (1125) (transition arrow "D'). hi entering the RD -OFFT state 1125, the control unit turns off multi-antenna receive diversity, returns the forward power control setpoint to the previous value, and starts a timer (e.g., short time duration).<br>
[0051]	From the RD_OFFT state 1125, if the timer expires and the quality test does not<br>
indicate application of multi-antenna receive diversity, then the state machine enters the multi-antenna receive diversity enabled off state (RD_EOFF) 1105 (transition arrow "E"). From either the RD_EOFF state 1105 or the RD_OFFT 1125 state, the state machine enters the multi-antenna receive diversity on quality timer (RD_ONQT) 1130 state if the quahty test indicates application of multi-antenna receive diversity (transition arrow "F"). Under this scenario, the control unit turns on multi-antenna receive diversity and starts a quahty timer of relatively long duration. The state machine also reenters the RDJDNQT state 1130 (i.e., from the RDJDNQT state) if the quality test indicates application of multi-antenna receive diversity (transition arrow "G"). For the reentry condition, the quality timer is reset. Also, the state machine enters the RDJDNQT state 1130, from the RD_POFF state 1120, if the quahty test indicates application of multi-antenna receive diversity (transition arrow "H"). When entering the RDJDNQT 1130 state from the RDJPOFF 1120 state, the control unit starts the quahty timer, and returns the forward power control set point to the initial value. The state machine also enters the RD_ONQT state 1130 when multi-antenna receive diversity is turned on from RD_ONCT 1110 and RD_ON 1115 states (transition arrows "I" and "J", respectively). The RD_ONQT 1130 state is entered from the RDJDNCT 1110 and RDJDN 1115 states if the quahty test indicates application of multi-antenna receive diversity. From these states, the control unit commences the quality timer. If the quahty timer expires and the quahty test does not indicate application of multi-antenna receive diversity, then the state machine transitions from the RD_ONQT 1130 state to the RD_ON 1115 state (transition arrow "K").<br>
[0052]	As shown in FIG. 7, a forced off command, from a multi-antenna receive<br>
diversity "off' state, results in a transition from the RD_EOFF 1105, RD_OFFT 1125 or RDJPOFF 1120 states to the multi-antenna receive diversity forced off (RDJFOFF) 1135 state (transition arrows "L", "M", and "N"). For a forced off condition from an "off state, multi-antenna receive diversity is disabled. A forced off command may be<br><br>
WO 2005/088864<br><br>
19<br><br>
PCTAJS2005/007114<br><br>
issued because the mobile device is not enabled for multi-antenna receive diversity or a hybrid mode is utilizing the receiver resources.<br>
[0053]	If multi-antenna receive diversity is in any "on" state, represented as Any RD<br>
On State 1140 in FIG. 7, the state machine transitions to the RD_POFF 1120 state in response to an off command (transition arrow "O"). In addition, the control unit adjusts the forward power control setpoint prior to turning off multi-antenna receive diversity. If a release forced off command is issued, the state machine transitions from the RD_FOFF state 1135 to the RD_EOFF state 1105 (transition arrow "P"). The system may also issue a force on command. If a force on command is issued, from any state, shown as 1150 in FIG. 7, the state machine transitions to the multi-antenna receive diversity forced on (RD_FON) state 1160 (transition arrow "Q"). If the system issues a release force on command, the state machine transitions from the RDJFON state 1160 to the RD_ON state 1115 (transition arrow "B")<br>

ABSTRACT<br>
"MULTI-ANTENNA RECEIVE DIVERSITY CONTROL IN WIRELESS<br>
COMM UNI CATIONS"<br>
A mobile device comprises a receiver unit that has at least two receivers to implement multi-antenna receive diversity. A control unit estimates, at the mobile, an amount of utilization by a traffic channel of the mobile of total transmission power capacity at a base station. The mobile applies multi-antenna receive diversity in the mobile device based on the power capacity utilization. The mobile estimates an amount of power a network is transmitting to the mobile relative to a pilot reference. Other indicators are based on quality of the traffic channel between the mobile and the network, capacity limiting resources, a number of sectors in a soft hand-off in a wireless system, etc. The indicators are used to control application of multi-antenna receive diversity in a mobile device.<br>
