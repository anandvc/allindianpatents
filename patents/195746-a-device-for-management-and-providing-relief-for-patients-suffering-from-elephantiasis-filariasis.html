The present invention relates to device for management and providing relief for patients suffering from Elephantiasis/Filariasis of a leg type ailments.<br>
Elephantiasis type of element is commonly referred to as Filariasis, which is characterised by gross thickening of skin and connective tissue, especially of legs caused by blockage of lymphatic vessels, usually by infestation with filaria worms. This is a major public health problem in Asia, Africa and Latin America.<br>
It has reported that in India about 27 million people carry microfilaria caused by larvae of adult worms in their blood and 21 million people have filariasis. Recent studies reveal that about 412 million people living in endemic areas in India are at risk.<br>
PROBLEMS OF FILARIA PATIENT:<br>
Filaria is not a killing disease but is responsible for great suffering to the patient on massive swelling of leg. Elephantiasis is the end result of filariasis. This is hyperplasia of skin and connective tissue.<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
On super infection on the affected part may lead to septic lymphangities or abscess formation.<br>
It is a social stigma particularly among the unmarried women.<br>
It has been found that surgery in an earlier stage of Elephantiasis to open pathways for lymphatic obstruction may be helpful. Excision by surgery of adventitious tissue sometimes provides relief to the patient, but adventitious tissue may grow again. This type of surgical operations are expensive and the patient has to be confined in bed for a long period.<br>
Management of elephantiasis/filariasis using drugs is also in vogue and may be effective to reduce the massive swelling but in good number of patients exhibit serious allergic reactions. The common drug used is Diethyl Carbamazine (DEC). However, the same is toxic in nature and cannot be prescribed particularly to pregnant women, people having heart ailments, liver diseases and kidney troubles.<br>
It has been further reported that application of elastic bandage may help for forcing lymph out of the affected site. However this has<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
disadvantages - in that pressure cannot be measured and pressure is nonuniform on the affected part Furthermore, the patient feels discomfort and pain if the elastic bandage is excessively tightened. If bandage is loose, no purpose would be served. Repeated use of the tape looses its effectiveness of elasticity.<br>
It has therefore, been a long felt need to develop such a device which obviates the disadvantages mentioned above.<br>
It has been further long felt need to develop such devices which not only is cheaper in cost but is easy to handle and reusable and has lonqer<br>
life.<br>
These and other objects have been achieved by the proposed device of the present invention.<br>
The basic utility of the device of the present invention is to provide relieve to the sufferings of the huge number of Filaria patients by providing<br><br>

2. Fig. 2 shows the device of present invention in inflatable condition;<br>
3. Fig. 3 shows schematic representation of the bag of the present invention.<br>
The bag of present invention is more or less appeared to be an English alphabet 'L' shaped which consists of foot end 4 and thigh end 3 and is made out of rubberised cotton fabric or any other like material such as cotton, synthetic material and/or combination thereof.<br>
Fastening means 2 is provided between the foot and knee portion of the bag. Two air valves (1) are provided on the thigh end for pumping compressed air and for measuring the air pressure by manometer or any other conventional means.<br>
Height tape 5 is provided preferably in the middle of the bag between the double walls of the bag to control excessive bulging of walls when compressed air is inserted through air valve 1 and could transmit the pressure on the patient's leg. Height tape 6 is provided at the thigh area to maintain the shape of bag.<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
These height tapes are built in between the 2 layers on all inner sides of the bag to maintain the shape of bag when inflated (8).<br>
To provide extra reinforcement, tapes with stitching are provided (9) and (10). Rubberised cotton fabric being used for making the body of the bag (11).<br>
At the foot end, control tape (7) is provided to retain the shape of the bag. Likewise, at thigh end inside taping (8) is provided to retain the shape of bag.<br>
It is also preferable to provide tape (9) for reinforcement which are stitched at the outer edge of the bag at leg and thigh portion of the bag.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION:<br>
The device of the present invention is made out of natural rubber coated cotton fabric double wall 'L' shaped bag fabricated in such a manner<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
to match the contour and shape of a human leg. The bag can be easily inserted on the swelled leg of a Filaria patient covering the foot to thigh like an inflatable sack.<br>
Two rubber made valves fitted on the upper portion of the bag, one is for inserting compressed air second one is connected to a manometer to measure the pressure of the air compressed inside the bag.<br>
A plastic slide fastener of from 30cm to 40cm long is fitted at the tower halves of the bag for easy donning and doffing. Air pressure may be applied between the walls of the bag, gradually inflated and exert uniform pressure through out the circumferences of the swelled leg of the patient Air pressure can be measured with the help of a manometer or any other instrument and the pressure can be from 0.5 to 4 psi maximum.<br>
To prevent excessive expansion of the outer wall of the bag, height tapes are used inside the double walls of the bag as controlling parts during the fabrication of the device.<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
The bag is highly flexible, comfortable to use because the outer walls are made out of cotton fabric or like material. It can be usable for years together. It is hygienic and is made out of Bio-degradabie materials like natural rubber and cotton fabric.<br>
Compressed air may be inserted with the help of manually operated foot-pump or by small electrically operated air compressor or simply by hand operated bicycle pump. Hence, the device can be used for the management of elephantiasis/filariasis even in remote areas.<br>
The total bag is fabricated out of unvulcanised rubberised fabric and simultaneously vulcanised to make the joints permanently sealed to ensure that the whole bag is fully leak proof and highly flexible to provide comfort to the patient while use.<br>
After vulcanization the bag is stitched to give the desired shape. Rubberised tapes are stitched at the joints to give extra reinforcement to the sack. Slide fastener is fitted by stitching on the outer profile of the bag for easy put on over the swelled leg of the patient.<br><br>
- 10 -<br>
No synthetic fabric has been used which may cause discomfort to the patient while use because of its non breathable character. And the synthetic fabric is not biodegradable may be allergic to the ailing patient<br>
Pressurisation of the lymph at the stage of lymphoedema of a Fileria patient with a measured air pressure by the help of the invented highly flexible inflatable bag will be of great help for forcing lymph out of the affected site.<br>
This will help to reduce the excessive swelling which is the cause of suffering to the filaria patient On repeated administration of this pressure treatment by this method will help in reducing the swelling of the patient The amount of pressure necessary for the patient and the number of sittings required at a particular stage of lymphoedema are to be advised by the medical practitioner.<br><br>
