Technical  Field<br>
The invention relates to an irrigator capable of angular movement about an approximately vertical axis to cover an area requiring irrigation. The irrigator has been designed so as to be quick and simple to put together, and so , that most of its components can easily be moulded, for example in synthetic resin. These and other objects and advantages will be clear from the following text. Disclosure  of  the  Invention<br>
The irrigator is of the type having a leaktight coupling between the fixed part and the mobile part, and a pipe head offering a curved path in which a portion that commences axially is deflected to form a final portion having a certain inclination'. According to the invention said inclined final portion is very short and forms a seat for an interchangeable nozzle selectable from a series of nozzles having tapering through orifices of different , inclinations and all connectable  to  said  initial  portion.<br>
Said nozzles and their seat may have snap-fitting forms, with guides to allow only one angular position of the nozzle when inserted into the seat. Said nozzles are advantageously made of a material offering elastic flexibility for easy insertion and removal.<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an irrigator capable of angular movement about an axis of orientation and made up of components made in synthetic resin, with a seal between the fixed part and a mobile part and with a pipe head offering a curved path with an initial portion that commences axially and is deflected by a final portion having a certain inclination characterized in that said inchned fmal portion is very short and forms a seat for an interchangeable nozzle selectable from a series of nozzles having tapering through orifices of different inclinations and all connectable to the deflection of said initial portion .<br>
The invention will be understood more clearly from the description and accompanying drawings, in which;<br><br>
Fig. 1 shows a general axial section of the irrigator;<br>
Fig. 2 shows an exploded view of the main components  of  the  irrigator;<br>
Figs. 3 and 4 show a view on III-III and a local  section  on  IV-IV  as  marked  in  Fig.   2;<br>
Fig. 5 shows, separately, an elastic retaining ring component for locking together the fixed part and angularly  mobile  part  while  allowing  angular  movement;<br>
Figs. 6 and 7 show in isolation, in side elevation and viewed from the line marked VII-VII in Fig. 6 the pivoting arm by which the jet of the nozzles is  used  to  cause  angular  movement;   and<br>
Figs. 8, 9 and 10 show three possible examples of  interchangeable  nozzles  in  axial  section.<br>
In  some   of  the  drawings  the  positions   of  parts of  the  components  illustrated  are  altered  for  clarity. Detailed  description  of  an  embodiment  of  the  invention<br>
As illustrated in the accompanying drawing, 1 denotes the fixed part as a whole and 3 the mobile part. The function of the latter is to form a spray head inclined at a shallow angle to the horizontal and offering the possibility of producing jets of different inclinations in the ma'nner indicated later; the mobile part 3 is actually that part which forms a deflecting bend. 5 denotes a pivoting arm which, in a manner known per se, causes the mobile part 3 to move angularly in successive and periodically reversed steps by using the energy supplied by the jet of irrigating liquid. In Figs. 1 and 2, 7 denotes one of the nozzles that can be fitted  into  the  mobile  part  3.<br>
The  fixed  part  1  comprises  a  large  axial  cavity<br><br>
formed on the outside for handling purposes; the axial passage 11 includes a narrower intermediate portion 13 which may include a grid 14; above this is a final double step 15 which forms the seat for an axial seal 8 and  allows   relative  movement  between  the   fixed  part   1<br><br>
and  the  mobile  part  3.   Formed  around  the  outside  of  the reduced-diameter   portion    13   of   the   passage    11   is   an external  annular   seat   17   for  an  elastic  ring  9  open  at 9A     and     forming     two     opposite     teeth     9B     that     are triangular   in   shape   or   otherwise   present   an   inclined guide   surface   for  insertion.   The  external  annular  seat 17  of  the  part  1     may  be  defined  by  two  series  of  lower 17A  and  upper  17B  projections  that  define  said  seat  and are  intended  to  minimize  the  weight   of  the  component   1 and   reduce   friction   between   the   surface   defining   the annular   seat   17   and   the   elastic   retaining   ring   9.   The fixed  part   1   is   a  component  that  can  easily  be  moulded in,     for     example,     synthetic     resin,     using     a    mould provided   with    masks    and    with    a    suitable    number    of laterally  movable  parts   to  enable  rational   orientation of    the    projections    17A   and    17B.    The    gap    9A   in   the elastic    retaining    ring    9    is    sufficiently    large    to ensure      that,-      with     a      sufficiently      small      elastic deformation,    it   can   be   fitted   transversely   around   the component   1   and   accommodated   and   held ' in   the   annular seat   17  defined  by  the  projections  17A  and  17B,   in  such a   way    that    its    teeth    9B    project    somewhat    from    the external    dimensions    of    said    fixed    part    1,    for    the purposes  indicated  later.<br>
The mobile part 3 (see in particular Figs. 2, 3 and 4) has at the bottom a bell 31 in the wall of which two diametrically opposite transverse through slots 31A are formed, their shape essentially corresponding to that of the rounded teeth 9B of the elastic retaining ring 9; underneath each of these through slots 31A is a rounding 3IB on the bottom rim of the bell 31 designed to act on the inclined, that is rounded, teeth 9B of the ring 9 at the assembly stage. An initial portion 32A of a curved path commences in the interior of the bell and extends into a final portion 32B inclined at an angle A, which may be of around 17* relative to a plane perpendicular to the axis of the bell 31 and of the   initial   portion   32A   of   the   curved   path   32A,    32B;<br><br>
this   portion   32B   is   very   short   and   basically   forms   a<br>
seat    for    accommodating    a    nozzle    1,    which    will    be<br>
described  later.   The  component   forming  the  mobile  part<br>
3  continues  axially  upwards  above  the  curved  path  32A,<br>
32B  of  the  pipe  head,   to  form  an  axial  coupling  33  from<br>
which   there  rises   a  pin   34,   also  axial;   in   the   recess<br>
between   the   coupling   33   and  the   pin   34   there   are   two<br>
external   stops   33A   for   the   purposes   indicated   later.<br>
The   pin   34   is   axially   hollow   and   slotted   at   34A   to<br>
define  two  opposite  elastic   fingers   34B,   each  of  which<br>
has    an    elastic    tooth    35    shaped    for    insertion    i.e.<br>
rounded  for  the  purposes  indicated  later.   Formed  on  the<br>
outside   of   the  component   3,   on  the   side   away   from  the<br>
inclined   portion   32B   of   the   passage   forming   the   pipe<br>
head,    is   a   box   36   for   the   return   movement.   The   path<br>
formed  by  the  portions  32A  and  32B  starts  with  a  collar<br>
37   that  projects  a  short  distance   into  the  interior  of<br>
the  bell   31   so  as   to  engage  with  the   seal   8   housed  ir.<br>
the   seat   15   described   above;   formed   around  the   collar<br>
37   are   suitable  projections   37A  to   hold  the   seal   8   in<br>
position",   and  this   seal   8   itself   is   of   a   generally  U-<br>
shaped   section   so   as   to   fit   the   outward   cylindrical<br>
surface   (formed  by  the  step   15)   and  inward  cylindrical<br>
surface   (formed  by  the  collar  37).   The  seat   32B  formed<br>
by   the    final   portion   of   the   path   of   the   pipe    head<br>
contains      a      shallow      annular      channel      38      and      a<br>
longitudinal    groove     39     for    the    purposes     indicated<br>
later.    In   at   least   the   initial   portion   32A   the   path<br>
contains  suitable  longitudinal  ribs  by  way  of  guides  to<br>
encourage  the  laminar  flow  of  the  liquid  supplied  under<br>
pressure   to   the   irrigator   to   form   the    inclined   jet<br>
which    is    thrown    parabolically    and    with    an    angular<br>
movement   about   the   axis   of   the   irrigator,   about  which<br>
the  mobile  part  3  moves.<br>
	The  pivoting  arm  5  comprises  a  through—seet  51<br>
with longitudinal grooves 51A and with a lower enlargement 51B containing stops 52 designed to interact  with  the  stops  33A  of  the  mobile  part  3  by  way<br><br>
of a suitable limitation on the angular excursion of which the pivoting arm 5 is capable relative to the mobile part 3. The through seat 51 is designed to accommodate the pin 34 and its longitudinal grooves 51A are designed to allow the elastic teeth 35 on the elastic fingers 34B formed by the pin 34 to be pushed through conveniently. It should be observed that in order to make the drawing simple to understand, the slots 34A, the elastic teeth 35 and the fingers 35B on the one hand and the longitudinal grooves 51A on the other are not depicted in the same positions in all the figures. Formed around the through seat 51 is a housing 53 of annular cross section for a helical spring 54 which is placed in the housing 53 and compressed between the bottom of this housing and a cap 55, which can be mounted on the end of the pin 34, using the elastic teeth 35 to engage in slots 55A in said cap 55. The pivoting arm 5 includes a blade 56 designed to be struck by the jet as it leaves the pipe head, while on the other side is an extension 57 in the form of an inverted box which serves to repeat the angular excursions  imposed  on  the  nozzle.<br>
Figs. 8, 9 and 10 illustrate three different nozzles that can be fitted into the seat 32B. Each of these nozzles, referred to generally by the numeral 7, has a surface 71 that mates with the surface of the seat 32B of the final portion of the path of the pipe head formed in the mobile part 3; on this surface 71 is an annular projection 72 which will fit into the annular channel 38 in the seat 32B; also on this surface 71 is a longitudinal rib 73 which will fit into the groove 39 formed in the seat 32B. Each of these nozzles 7 can thus be engaged in the seat 32B where the annular   recess   38   holds   them   in   place   and   the   rib   73<br>
combines   with   the    longitudinal    groove    39    to   define	<br>
their  angular  position.   The  nozzles  7  are  all  made  from a  synthetic  resin  having  a  certain  elastic   flexibility<br><br>
such    that    each    nozzle    is    easy    to    insert    into    and extract  from  the   seat .32B.<br>
Each  nozzle  7  is  provided  with  a  flange  74  that<br>
rests   against   the   edge   32C   of   the  pipe   head   formed  by<br>
the  mobile  part  3;   in  this   flange   74   is  an  indentation<br>
74A,   the  presence  of  which  facilitates  the  removal  of  a<br>
nozzle   from  its  seat  32B.   At  the   opposite  end  from  the<br>
flange   74,    each   nozzle   7   has   a   mouth   75   which   will<br>
correspond  with  the  orifice  32E  of  the  passage  32A,   32B<br>
at    the    bottom    of    the    seat    32B.    This    mouth    75    is<br>
identical  for  all  the  nozzles  and  from  it  there  extends<br>
a   tapering   through   orifice   76,   which   differs   for   each<br>
nozzle   shown   in   Figs.    8,    9   and   10   in   respect   of   the<br>
inclination  of  the  axis  of  said  orifice  relative  to  the<br>
axis  X-X  of  the  nozzle,   in  particular  of  the  surface  71<br>
that  mates  with  the   seat  32B.   Fig.   8   shows  a  nozzle   7X<br>
in  which   the   axis   of  the   tapering   through   orifice   76X<br>
coincides   with  the   axis   X-X  of   the   surface   71.   Fig.   9<br>
shows  a  nozzle  7Y  whose  tapering  through  orifice  7 6y  is<br>
inclined   at   an   angle   B   relative   to   the   axis   X-X.   The<br>
nozzle  7Z  illustrated  in  Fig.   10  has  a  tapering  through<br>
orifice   76Z   inclined   relative   to   the   axis   X-X   of   the<br>
surface  71  at  an  angle  C  opposite  to  the  angle  B  of  the<br>
nozzle  7Y  shown  in  Fig.   9.   The  seat   32B  is  inclined  by<br>
the   angle   A   relative   to   a   plane   perpendicular   to   the<br>
main  axis   of   the   fixed  and  mobile  parts   1   and   3.   With<br>
this  arrangement  of  the  seat  32B  and  of  the  axes  of  the<br>
tapering    through    orifices    76X,     76Y    and    76Z    it    is<br>
possible  to  obtain  three  different  inclinations  of  the<br>
final     jets     produced     by     the     irrigator,      by     using<br>
different  nozzles.<br>
The seal 8 is fitted into the seat formed by the step 15 while the elastic ring 9 is accommodated in the annular seat 17, into which it is introduced with a slight elastic defoliation to enlarge the gap 9A. The bell 31 of the mobile part 3 is fitted over the top of the fixed part 1; in the process the bottom edge of the bell   is   pushed   over   the   teeth   9B   projecting   from   the<br><br>
ring 9, which retract because of the sliding action made possible by the roundings 3IB before pushing out again - as the bell is pushed home - through the slits 31A in the wall of the bell thereby locking the member 3 on the member 1 in the axial direction while allowing rotation to take place when the ring 9 slides round inside the seat 17. Assembly causes the collar 37 of the initial part 32A of the curved passage of the pipe head to pass into the annular seal 8, thereby sealing the connection between the fixed part and the mobile part. The pivot arm 5 is fitted onto the pin 34 so that it rests on the recess formed by the coupling 33; in this way the stops 33A and 52 are brought together and engaged in such a way as to bring about the stepwise angular movements of the mobile part 3. The spring 54 is then inserted in the annular seat 53 and the cap 55 pushed over the end of the pin 34, making use of the elasticity of the extensions 34B and of the rounding of the teeth 35, which then engage in the slots 55A. This creates a torsion in the spring 54 and consequently axially stabilizes the pivoting arm 55, which is otherwise free to move within the limits imposed by the stops   33A  and  52.<br>
The irrigator is now completely assembled and ready to be screwed by means of its screw thread 12 onto the end of the pipe supplying the irrigating fluid. One or other of the nozzles 7 is inserted into the seat 32B, it being possible by this means to vary the outlet axis of the jet from the nozzle and hence the inclination of the jet of water. The axis of the jet as it leaves the nozzle can thus be inclined relative to a plane perpendicular to the axis of the components 1 and 3: by the angle A, when using nozzle 7X shown in Fig. 8; or by angle A+B when using nozzle 7y shown in Fig. 9; or by angle A-C, when using nozzle 72 shown in Fig. 10. Assuming the seat 32B to have an inclination, i.e. angle A, of 17, the inclination that can  be  given  to  the  jet  when  choosing  one  of  the  three<br><br>
nozzles 7X, 7Y and 7Z can be l7 or, for instance, 24° or 10°, depending on whether nozzle 7X or 7Y or 7Z is being used, respectively. By increasing the number of nozzles with inclinations different to the angles B and C shown in Figs. 9 and 10, it is possible - and perfectly simple - to further vary the inclination of the jet of the irrigator, simply by inserting a different  nozzle  in  the  seat  32B.<br>
A nozzle 7 can easily be removed from the seat 32 either by hand or by placing a tool between the edge 32C and the flange 74 in the indentation 74A, Dismantling the irrigator, when required, is immensely simplified because the cap 55 can be taken off simply by pressing in the teeth 35 through the slots 55A: this allows the spring to be withdrawn and the pivoting arm 5 taken off the pin 34. By pushing in the teeth 9B of the elastic ring 9 through the slots 31A it is also possible to detach the mobile part 3 from the fixed part   1.<br>
The pin 34 may be formed by a component fitted onto the fixed part 3, e.g. connected to the coupling 33, the pin 34 being made in this case from a material having greater elasticity than can be obtained with the slots 34A in the pin 34 made integrally with the mobile part  3.<br><br><br>
