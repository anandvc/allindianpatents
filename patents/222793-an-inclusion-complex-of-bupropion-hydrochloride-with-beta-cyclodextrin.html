DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a novel inclusion complex of (=j-l-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-[(l .'.-dimethylethyl) amino]-1-propane hydrochloride, commonly known as bupropion hydrochloride, of the following Formula 1<br><br><br><br><br>
with beta-cyclodextrin. where the molar ratio of bupropion hydrochloride to beta cyclodextrin is 1 : (0.25 - 4). The inclusion complex stabilizes the bupropion hydrochloride against degradation.<br>
The present invention further provides a method for preparing a novel inclusion complex of bupropion hydrochloride with beta cyclodextrin, comprising the steps of:<br>
1.        wetting an amount of beta cyclodextrin with a pharmaceutical!)' acceptable solvent Such as water, acetone and/or a CI to C4 aliphatic alcohol and mixtures thereof, at room<br>
temperature to form a semisolid mixture;<br>
6<br><br>
2.	shear mixing the resulting semisolid mixture with bupropion hydrochloride to form an inclusion complex; and<br>
3.	drying the shear mixed inclusion complex at 40 - 80. degrees. C;<br>
where the molar ratio of bupropion hydrochloride to beta cyclodextrin is 1 : (0.25 - 4.0), and preferably is 1: (0.5-2.0).<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the C1-C4. aliphatic alcohol is selected from the group consisting of isopropyl alcohol, ethanol, and their combinations. The shear mixed inclusion complex ma/ be freeze dried or spray dried or dried by low temperature vacuum evaporation in a fluidized bed dryer or tray dryer. In a preferred embodiment, drying is carried out in a tray dryer at 40 -60. degrees. C.<br>
The present invention also provides a novel stabilized sustained release pharmaceutical composition containing the novel inclusion complex of bupropion hydrochloride with beta cyclodextrin, that further contains drug release rate controlling materials selected from a combination of hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose with hydroxypropyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose or stearic acid, the molar ratio of bupropion hydrochloride to beta cyclodextrin being 1 : (0.25 - 4.0). Where a mixture of the release rate controlling materials is employed, the weight ratio of one release rate controlling material to the other is within the range of about 1 : 0.1 to 0.1 : 1 , and preferably is within the range of about 1 : 0.3 to 0.3 : 1.<br>
7 <br>
.• In a preferred embodiment, the drug release rate controlling materials include hydroxy-propyl methyl cellulose with average molecular weight of 20000 to 120000, preferably 86000 to 120000, and with a methoxy degree of substitution ranging from 1.36 to 1.90 and hydroxypropyl molar substitution ranging from 0.18 to 0.25.<br>
Where hydroxypropyl cellulose is employed as a drug release rate controiling material, it preferably has molecular weight in the range of 370000 to 1150000, preferably from $50000 to 1150000.   Where sodium carboxymethylcellulose is so employed, it has a molecular weight in the range of 90000 to 700000. preferably from 250000 to 700000, with degree of substitution ranging from 0.65 to 0.95.<br>
The combination of hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose with hydroxypropyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose or stearic acid has been found to effectively control the release rate of bupropion hydrochloride from the pharmaceutical compositions containing the inclusion complex of bupropion hydrochloride with beta cyclodextrin.<br>
The novel stabilized sustained release pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may further contain one or more conventional excipients, such as lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, colloidal silicone dioxide, titanium dioxide, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol-6000, talc, magnesium stearate and other excipients known in the art.<br>
8 <br>
The novel pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention can be used to produce oral dosage forms as compressed tablets of any shape, preferably round, or can be formed into compressed compact slugs filled into capsules using modern capsule filling machines. Dosage forms of the novel pharmaceutical composition of the present invention "generally contain 25 mg to 500 mg of bupropion hydrochloride, and preferably contain 50mg, 75 mg. 100 mg, or 150 mg of active ingredient, bupropion hydrochloride.<br>
The present invention also provides a method for preparing a novel stabilized sustained release pharmaceutical composition containing an inclusion complex of bupropion hydrochloride with beta cyclodextrin, and further containing a combination of hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose with hydroxypropyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose or stearic acid, where the molar ratio of bupropion hydrochloride to beta cyclodextrin is 1 : (0.25 - 4.0).<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are prepared by following method :<br>
a)	The novel inclusion complex of bupropion hydrochloride with beta cyclodextrin is admixed with the excipients.<br>
b)	The mixture is granulated, dried, and milled. Solid dosage forms are prepared such as by compressing the milled granulalion to form tablets or caplets. Alternatively capsules maybe prepared by placing the compact slugs of milled granulation in, for example, a two part hard gelatin capsule.<br>
9<br><br>
c)        Solid dosage forms such as tablets may optionally be film coated with aqueous or organic solvent solution of commonly known film coating maerials such as hydroxy-propyl methyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, etc.<br>
The method for preparing the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention is descnbed in greater detail in the examples that follow.<br>
The in-vitro release rate of bupropion hydrochloride from the sustained release pharmaceutical compositions disclosed herein (whether or not film coated) in 0.1 X HCI up to the first hour and then continued in Phosphate buffer pH 6.8 USP, is preferably is follows:<br><br>
Time (Hours)	% Bupropion HCI release<br>
1st Hour(In 0.1 N HC1)	20 - 40%<br>
2nd Hour(Phosphate Buffer pH 6.8)	40-60%<br>
4,h Hour(Phosphate Buffer pH 6.8)	60 - 80 %<br>
8lh Hour(Phosphate Buffer pH 6.S)	NLT 80 %<br>
10<br><br>
-The stability of the novel sustained release pharmaceutical compositions was tested in accordance with industry standards by storage for four to twelve weeks at various accelerated<br>
. conditions such as 40. degrees. C. with about 7.5% relative humidity; and also 50. degrees. C. Sustained release pharmaceutical compositions containing the novel inclusion complex of bupropion hydrochloride with beta cyclodextrin of the present invention stored under these conditions retained at least 98% and at least 95% respectively, of the bupropion hydrochloride in the composition at the time of storage. The amount of bupropion hydrochloride remaining after storage may be determined through HPLC or other standard procedures.<br>
A kinetic degradation study of the novel inclusion complex of bupropion hydrochloride with beta cyclodextrin of the present invention also showed excellent stabilization of bupropion hydrochloride when suspended in water and stored at 50 degrees. C for four weeks.<br>
Figure 2A shows an HPLC chromatogram obtained for a bupropion hydrochloride sustained release tablet without a beta cyclodextrin inclusion complex, containing the same matrix material for a sustained release dosage form as the one for sustained release tablets of bupropion hydrochloride containing the inclusion complex, illustrated by figure 2B. One can clearly see the difference in degradation products and assay percentage between the two formulations. The sustained release tablet without die inclusion complex showed the degradation as high as 45% as indicated by figure 2A . whereas there is hardly any degradation at 50°C for over a period of 4 weeks with tablets made with the inclusion complex. Figures 2C and 2D further show the HPLC chromatograms illustrating the stability of sustained release tablets not containing the inclusion<br>

The inclusion complex of the present invention is characterized as follows :<br>
Thermograms of bupropion hydrochloride, beta cyclodextrin, a physical mixture of bupropion hydrochloride and beta cyclodextrin 1: 1 and the bupropion hydrochloride-beta cyclodextrin inclusion complex of the invention are as shown in figures 1 A, IB, IC, and ID respectively. The<br>
• Vr- 3if<br><br>
peak at 224 °C in Fig 1A was due to.the melting of bupropion hydrochloride. Fig !B show's an endothermic peak at 168 °C corresponding to beta cyclodextrin. The physical mixture showed endothermic peaks of both bupropion hydrochloride at  205.9 °C and beta cyclodextrin at 159.5 °C as in Fig 1C. The inclusion complex showed an endothermic peak of cyclodextrin sin-d to 126 °C while endothermic peak of the bupropion hydrochloride remained at 209°C as in rig ID.<br>
The weights of the inclusion complex and physical mixture were strictly identical. Normally, when an acidic or basic drug is taken without its salts, it has been observed that the drug's endothermic peak merges with the endothermic peak of beta cyclodextrin. In this case, however, a substantial shift in endothermic peak of beta cyclodextrin in the inclusion complex is seea but not in the case of the physical mixture. This is seen as a proof of inclusion complex fonnHtion. The formation of inclusion complex is further evidenced by 2D NOESY NMR spectra Esirg Bruker 600 Hz FTNMR.<br>
While the invention has been described with respect to certain specific embodiments, it will be appreciated that many modifications and changes may be made by those skilled in the an without departing from the invention. It is intended, therefore, by the appended claims to cover all such modifications and changes as may fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
