BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
I.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to communications. More particularly, the present invention relates to a novel and improved method and apparatus for transmitting and receiving broadcast information in a multi-carrier CDMA communication system.<br>
II.	Description of the Related Art<br>
The   use   of   code   division   multiple   access   (CDMA)   modulation<br>
techniques is one of several techniques for facilitating communications  in<br>
which a large number of system users are present.   Other multiple access<br>
communication  system techniques, such as time  division  multiple  access<br>
(TDMA) and frequency division multiple access (FDMA) are known in the<br>
art.   However, the spread spectrum modulation   technique of CDMA has<br>
significant advantages over these modulation techniques for multiple access<br>
:ommunication systems.  The use of CDMA techniques in a multiple access<br>
:ommunication   svstem is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,901,307, entitled<br>
'SPREAD SPECTRUM MULTIPLE ACCESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
J5ING   SATELLITE  OR TERRESTRIAL   REPEATERS",   assigned   to   the<br>
assignee   of   the   present   invention,   of  which   the   disclosure   thereof   is<br>
ncorporated   bv reference  herein.     The   use   of  CDMA  techniques   in   a<br>
nultiple  access communication  system is further disclosed in U.S. Patent<br>
No.   5,103,459, entitled   "SYSTEM   AND   METHOD  FOR  GENERATING<br>
SIGNAL WAVEFORMS IN A CDMA CELLULAR TELEPHONE SYSTEM",<br>
issigned to the assignee of the present invention,  of which the disclosure<br>
hereof is incorporated by reference herein.   CDMA has been standardized b\'<br>
he Telecommunications  Industry Association in Interim Standards IS-95A<br>
nd IS-95B, entitled "Mobile Station-Base Station Compatibility Standard for<br>
)ual Mode Spread Spectrum Systems" (referred to hereafter collectively as<br>
5-95).<br>
In IS-95 communications systems channels of information ransmitted from a common base station are distinguished from one nother by orthogonal spreading codes.   Each channel is spread by a unique<br><br>
orthogonal spreading sequence. The channels that are transmitted by an IS-95 base station include, a pilot channel, a sync channel, at least one paging channel and dedicated traffic channels. The pilot channels is used tc provide a phase reference for coherent demodulation of the other channels by mobile stations within the coverage area of the base station. The sync channel carriers overhead information such as timing information, pilot PN offset information and other information that allows the reception of the other overhead channels. The paging channel notifies mobile stations of mobile terminated calls directed to the mobile station in the area. Dedicated traffic channels provide information directed to the user of a specific mobile station in the coverage area of the base station.<br>
In IS-95, when the base station sends a Sync Channel  Message, it shall uses the fixed-length message format of Table 1 below:<br><br>
MSG_TYPE	Message type.<br>
P_REV	Protocol revision level.<br>
M1N_P_REV	Minimum protocol revision level.   The base station sets<br>
this field to prevent  mobile  stations which  cannot  be supported by the base station from accessing the system.<br><br>
SID	System identification.  The base station shall set this field<br>
to the system identification number for this system.<br>
NID	Network   identification.      This   field   serves   as  a  sub-<br>
identifier of a system as defined by the owner of the SID.<br>
PILOT_PN	Pilot PN sequence offset index. The base station shall set<br>
this field to the pilot PN sequence offset for this base station, in units of 64 PN chips.<br>
TC_STATE	Long code state.   The base station shall set this field to<br>
the long code state at the time given by the SYS_TIME field of this message.<br>
SYS_TIME	System time.   The base station shall set this field to the<br>
System Time as of four Sync Channel super frames (320 ms) after the end of the last super frame containing any part of this Sync Channel Message, minus the pilot PN sequence offset, in units of 80 ms.<br>
LP_SEC	The number of leap seconds that have occurred since the<br>
start of System Time.<br>
LTM_OFF	Offset of local time from System Time. The base station<br>
shall set this field to the two's complement offset of local time from System Time, in units of 30 minutes.<br>
DAYLT	Daylight savings time indicator. If daylight savings time<br>
is in effect, the base station shall set this field to '1'; otherwise, the base station shall set this field to '0'.<br>
PRAT	Paging Channel data rate.  The base station shall set this<br>
field to the PRAT field value shown in Table 2 corresponding to the data rate used by the Paging Channels in the system.<br><br>
CDMA_FREQ	Frequency assignment.    The  base station shall  set this<br>
field to the CDMA Channel number corresponding to the CDMA frequency assignment for the CDMA Channel containing a Primary Paging Channel.<br><br>
In IS-95 systems, each base station transmits a pilot cnannei mat is covered only by a short PN sequence. In IS-95 systems, the short PN sequence repeats once every 26ms. The pilot signal transmissions from each base station are distinguished from one another by a phase offset with respect to one another. In particular, there each base station associated with a single base station controller differs in phase by at least 64 PN chips.<br>
Under normal operation, the mobile station acquires the pilot signal first. The pilot signal carries no data and is simply the all ones sequence spread by the common short code, which also spreads all of the other channels transmitted by the base station. After acquiring the pilot channel, the mobile station receives the information described above from the sync channel. The frame and interleaver timing on the sync channel are aligned with the pilot PN sequence. The zero state of the short PN sequence marks the starting point of the sync channel frame and interleaver.<br>
In the U.S. Personal Communication System (PCS) spectrum, the CDMA channel number N specifies the carrier frequencies of the forward and reverse link channels . In particular, channel number N corresponds to a reverse link carrier frequency of (1850 + 0.05N) MHz and a forward link carrier frequency of (1930 + 0.05N) MHz, where N ranges from 0 to 1199. The bandwidth of each CDMA channel is 1.25 MHz. Therefore, the channel numbers of adjacent CDMA channels are different by at least 25 (25 x 0.05 MHz = 1.25 MHz). To facilitate mobile stations' initial acquisition, certain carrier frequencies are designated as the preferred frequency assignments. Referring to FIG. 1, for an IS-95B CDMA system in the A block of PCS band, the channel numbers of the preferred frequency assignments are 25, 50, 7o, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 225, 250, and 275. Mobile stations will search the preferred frequency assignments first upon powering up.<br>
The International Telecommunications Union recently requested the submission of proposed methods for providing high rate data and high-quality speech services over wireless communication channels. A first of these proposals was issued by the Telecommunications Industry Associahon, entitled "The cdma2000 ITU-R RTT Candidate Submission" (hereafter cdma2000). cdma2000 proposes increasing the throughput of the forward link signals by transmitting portions of the information on three bands, each of 1.2288 MHz. This method is described as the "multi-carrier" approach.<br>
A multi-carrier CDMA system, that uses three adjacent 1.25 MHz RF channels   with   channel   spacing   also   equal   to   1.25   MHz   is  defined   in<br><br>
cdma2000. Referring to FIG. 2, a multi-carrier CDMA system in the A block of the PCS band can be deployed with the center channel on channel 50, 75, 100,125,150,175, 200, 225, or 250. Channels 50 and 250 are usually avoided to avoid interference to adjacent bands on the reverse link. In the proposed cdma2000 description, the reverse link may be direct-spread with a chip rate of 3.6864 Mcps, which makes the emission limit requirements more difficult to meet than for a chip rate of 1.2288 Mcps.<br>
A mobile station, upon powering up, searches for pilot signal on a preferred frequency. If no pilot is found in the current channel, it changes its channel and searches again. Once a pilot is acquired, the mobile station demodulates the Sync Channel associated with that pilot to receive timing information, pilot PN offset, and other information enabling its reception of the other overhead channels.<br>
In a multi-carrier approach, one method for providing Sync Channel data would be to tri-partition the Sync Channel message and place one third of the message on each of the three portions of the multi-carrier signal. If the Sync Channel of a multi-carrier system is spread over three channels, the mobile station will have to know the exact channels used by the system in order to demodulate the Sync Channel reliably. Since the exact channels are not known in advance, the mobile station has to try numerous combinations to receive the Sync Channel message. Given the number of preferred channels, the time spent on such trials could be excessive and therefore degrade the mobile station's initial acquisition time. Therefore, there is a need felt in the art for a method that minimizes the mobile station's search time.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is a novel and improved method and<br>
apparatus for transmitting broadcast information in a multi-carrier<br>
communication system. The proposed invention is to send the Sync<br>
Channel of the multi-carrier system in a 1.25 MHz channel bandwidth (i.e.,<br>
over a single carrier), and to specify the preferred channels for the Sync<br>
Channel transmission instead of the preferred channels for the entire multi-<br>
carrier svstem. The Svnc Channel Message will indicate the center frequency<br>
for a mutli-carrier system in the band if one exeists and the frequency of a<br>
single band system if one exists.	<br><br>
Considering the A block of the PCS band again, the preferred channels for Sync Channel transmission can be selected as channels 75, 150 and 225. This selection ensures that one of the preferred channels will always be used by any multi-carrier system regardless the location of its center channel. The mobile station, upon powering up, searches on the preferred channels for Sync Channel first. Once the pilot signal is acquired on any of these channels, the mobile station demodulates the Sync Channel on the channel as well. The mobile station learns from the Sync Channel Message the location of a multi-carrier and a single carrier system in the band if either exists. It can be easily observed that the number of channels to search and the number of hypotheses to try are significantly reduced by using the proposal in this disclosure. As a result, it improves the mobile station's initial acquisition time.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a multi-carrier base station operating within a predetermined set of frequencies wherein data components of forward link data are transmitted simultaneously on a plurality of frequency bands, said base station comprising: a first transmitter for transmitting a sync channel message on a single carrier frequency of said predetermined set of frequencies, wherein said sync channel message indicates at least a center frequency of a multi-carrier or single carrier transmission sub system; and at least one additional transmitter for transmitting remaining components of said forward link data on another carrier frequency of said predetermined set of frequencies.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates a typical band diagram for a multi-band<br>
communications      system.	In      currently      contemplated      wireless<br>
communications systems, mobile station that is attempting to begin service will tune to each possible frequency in a preferred set of frequencies and determine whether a system is available at that frequency. In FIG. 1, the channel numbers of the preferred frequency assignments are 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 225, 250, and 275, which corresponds to bands 200a, 200b, 200c, 200d, 200e, 200f, 200g, 200h, 200i, 200j and 200k. In the exemplary embodiment, each of these bands is 1.25Mh2 wide and is used to carry an IS-95 CDMA transmissions.<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates the possible center bands of a three component multi-carrier communication system as is contemplated in cdma2000 (also referred to as IS-2000). In the multi-carrier communication system, the mobile station tunes to each possible grouping of three adjacent channels and attempts to receive the Sync Channel message. In the current designs for multi-carrier systems the Sync Channel message will be divided into three component parts with each component part transmitted separately and simultaneously on a different carrier of the multi-carrier band. The mobile station first attempts to receive the Sync Channel message on a multi carrier system comprising bands 300b, 300c, 300d. If unsuccessful, the mobile station then attempts to acquire the Sync Channel on a multi-carrier system consisting of bands 300c, 300d, and 300e. This continues for each possible three band system until the mobile station checks for a multi-carrier system consisting of bands 300h, 3001 and 300j. For reasons described above, in the exemplary embodiment, bands 300a and 300k will not be used in a multi carrier system.<br>
This method of receiving the Sync Channel message is very inefficient and time consuming. If a mobile station is capable of operating in a multi-carrier or single carrier mode, the mobile station will potentially have to conduct eleven Ix searches or bands 200a-200k and seven multi-carrier searches using center frequencies 300c-300i. Ln a CDMA communication system, each band searched requires the mobile station to test a large number of FN offsets to detect the presence of the pilot signal. Thus, this method of acquisition requires a substantial time period.<br><br>
The present invention provides a significantly more efficient method for acquiring the necessary system parameters in a potentially mixed bandvv^idth communication system. In the present invention, the Sync Channel is always transmitted in a Ix band. In the preferred embodiment, the preferred channels are channels 75, 150 and 225. Thus, a mobile station need only conduct at most three searches to receive the Synch Channel message in Ix bandwidth in order to acquire the necessary information for acquisition of its preferred system. The present invention greatly reduces acquisition time in a mixed bandwidth communication system. In addition, by providing the Sync Channel message only on the preferred channels reduces the capacity impact of providing that overhead messaging on many more channels.<br>
The reason for the allocation of the preferred charmels of the present invention is that it provides the greatest flexibility in the provision of a multi-carrier system. With the allocation of the preferred channels to channel numbers 75, 150 and 220 (300c, 300f and 300j), a multi-carrier system provided anywhere in the band consisting of bands 300a-300k will include one of the preferred channels. A multi-carrier system comprising the bands 300a, 300b and 300c will include the preferred channel 300c. A multi-carrier system comprising the bands 300b, 300c and 300d will include the preferred channel of 300c. A multi-carrier system comprising the bands of 300c, 300d and 300e will include the preferred channel of 300c. A multi-carrier system comprising the bands of 300d, 300e and 300f will include the preferred channel of 300f. Any combinations of three adjacent bands will include a preferred charmel upon which the mobile station will be able to receive the necessary system parameters for operation.<br>
In the present invention, the mobile station tunes to a preferred channel (300c, 300f or 300i) and attempts to detect a pilot signal on that frequency band. If a pilot signal is detected the mobile station, receives demodulates and decodes the Sync Channel message. In the present invention, the Sync Channel message will provide information that identifies the center frequency of a multi-carrier system in the current set of frequency bands (if one exists) and the frequency of a Ix band in the current set of frequency bands (if one exists).<br>
The mobile station in response to the information received in the Sync Channel selects the system that is appropriate for its needs or capabilities. If the mobile station prefers to use a multi-carrier system, the mobile   station   uses   the   center   frequency   of   the   multi-carrier   system<br><br>
indicated in the Sync Channel message to tune to the nnulti-carrier system and receive the broadcast channel (BCH) message. The broadcast channel message will indicate to the mobile station the number of common control channels (CCCHs) that are employed by the current system. The mobile station takes the number of common control channels and using a predetermined hashing algorithm determines what code channel it will use to receive page messages from the transmitting base station.<br>
If the mobile station selects to operate in a single band system, the mobile station uses the information received in the Sync Channel message to tune to the appropriate frequency of the single band system. The mobile station then receives the general paging channel message on the primary paging channel. The general paging channel message provides the number of paging channels used by the single band system. The mobile station uses a predetermine hashing function to determine the code channel upon which the mobile station will receive paging message for the transmitting base station.<br>
The present invention is equally applicable to systems that may include 3X direct spread communicahons systems. In this embodiment, the Sync Channel message would include the addition information whether the 3X system is a direct spread system or a multi-carrier system. In addition, the Sync Channel message may also provide information respect whether the system uses a form of diversity transmission such as orthogonal transmit diversity (OTD). If methods of transmission diversity are possible in the multiple bandwidth communication system, specification of the means of transmit diversity greatly reduces the number of hypotheses that must be tested to acquire a system.<br>
These changes to the Sync Channel messages can be accommodated without necessitating the extension of the Sync Channel message used in IS-95B and illustrated above. In the current Sync Channel message there a large number of reserved bits that can be used to provide the additional information.<br>
FIG. 3 is a flowchart illustrating the acquisition operation oi the present invention. In block 2, the mobile station tunes to a preferred channel (300c, 300f or 300i). It will be understood that the present invention is disclosed in context of the PCS band of freqeuncies and can easily be extended to other bands such as the cellular band. Moreover, the selected set of  preferred   channels   though   preferred   for   three   carrier,   multi-carrier<br><br>
communications systems would be different for multi-carrier systems with a different number of carriers.<br>
In block 6, the mobile station determines whether the search operation was successful. In the exemplary embodiment, the present invention is incorporated into a CDMA communications system, though the present invention would be equally applicable to other mixed bandwidth communications systems. In the exemplary embodiment, the mobile station tunes its RF receiver to a preferred channel (300c, 300f, or 3001) and attempts to detect the presence of a pilot signal. In the exemplary embodiment of an IS-95 based CDMA communications system, each base station transmits its pilot signal using a unique pilot signal offset. Thus, the mobile station after tuning to a preferred channel (300c, 300f, or 3001), searches the possible PN offset hypotheses.<br>
The method and apparatus for detecting a pilot signal in a CDMA communication system are well known in the art and are described in detail in U.S. Patent No. 5,644,591, entitled "Method And Apparatus For Performing Search Acquisition In A CDMA Communication System", which is assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated by reference herein. The mobile station tests each PN offset hypothesis by computing the correlation between the received signal within the preferred frequency band with the PN hypothesis being tested. If the correlation energy for all PN hypotheses is less than a threshold value, then the acquisition at the preferred frequency is not successful and the operation moves to block 4. In block 4, the next preferred channel (300c, 300f, or 300i) to be tested by the mobile station is selected and the flow moves to block 2 and continues as described.<br>
When the mobile station detects sufficient correlation energy between the received signal at the preferred channel frequency and a PN offset hypothesis, a successful acquisition is declared. At this point the operation moves to block 8. In block 8, the mobile station receives the Sync Channel message. In the present invention, the Sync Channel message is transmitted in a single Ix band (300c, 300f, or 300i). In the exemplary embodiment of an IS-95 based CDMA communication system, the Sync Channel frame boundary and the interleaver boundary are aligned with the short PN sequence used to spread the pilot channel signal. Thus, upon successful acquisition of the pilot channel signal, the mobile station has enough information to de-interleave and decode the Sync Channel message.<br><br>
After receiving the Sync Channel message, the operation moves to block 10. The mobile station determines from the Sync Channel message the center frequency of a multi-carrier system in the current set of bands (if one exists) and the location of a single carrier band in the current set of bands (if one exists). The mobile station decides whether to operate in a multi-carrier mode or a single channel mode based on its capabilities and needs.<br>
The operation moves to control block 10. If the mobile station capable of operating in a multi-carrier mode decides to operate in multi-carrier mode, then the flow moves to block 12. In block 12, the mobile station initiates its RF hardware for multi-carrier reception. The mobile station will know from the received Sync Channel message the center frequency of a multi-carrier system in the current set of frequency bands if one exists. The operation then moves to block 14, where the mobile station receives the broadcast channel (BCH) signal and from that channel learn among other information the number of common control channels used by the communication system. The mobile station hashes the number of common control channels to determine the code channel that it should use to receive pages.<br>
If, back in block 10, the mobile station decides to use a single channel system because of limitations in its capability or other preference with respect to its service needs, the operation moves to block 16. In block 16, the mobile station initiates its RF hardware for single-carrier reception. The operation then moves to block 18, where the mobile station receives the general page message on a predetermined code channel. The general page message will state the number of paging channels used by the system. The mobile station hashes the number of paging channels used to determine the :ode channel that it will use to receive directed pages from the serving base station.<br>
FIG. 4 introduces the elements and nomenclature of an very simplified wireless communications system. Base station 30 transmits ■orward link signal 32 to mobile station 40. Mobile station 40 transmits •everse link signal 34 to base station 30.<br>
FIG. 5 is simplified block diagram illustrating the exemplary embodiment of base 30 as multi-carrier CDMA transmission system with hree forward link channels. Each of transmission subsystems 48 transmits I portion of forward link signal 32 on a different carrier frequency. Transmission subsystem 4Sa transmits a portion of forward link signal 32 on<br><br>
frequency f1, transmission subsystem 48b transmits a portion of forward link signal 32 on frequency f2, and transmission subsystem 48c transmits a portion of forward link signal 32 on frequency f3.<br>
The data for transmission on forward link signal 32 is provided to de¬multiplexer 50. De-multiplexer 50 provides the data to one of the three transmission subsystems 48. The present invention is described in term of a three carrier multi-carrier communication system because three IS-95 carriers each occupying 1.2288 MHz can fit into a 5MHz band. However, it will be understood by one skilled in the art that the teachings of the present invention can easily be extended to an arbitrary number of channels in a multi-carrier system.<br>
The de-multiplexed data streams are provided to modulators 52. In the exemplary embodiment, modulators 52 modulate the forward link data in accordance with a CDMA modulation format such as that described in the IS-95 standard and described in detail in the aforementioned U.S. Patent No. 5,103,459. The forward link data includes dedicated channel data that is for provision to a specific mobile station and broadcast channel data that is for provision to all mobile stations in the coverage area of base station 30 or a subset of mobile stations 30 in the coverage area of base station 30. The Sync Channel message is an example of broadcast data that is transmitted to all mobile stations in the coverage area of base station 30. In the present invention, the Synch Channel message is provided to a designated one of transmission subsystems 48 for transmission on a designated one of the three carriers.<br>
The modulated forward link data from modulators 52 is provided to up converter 54.

The up converted signals are then combined for transmission through antenna 56.<br>
FIG. 6 illustrates the exemplary embodiment of modulators 52 which modulate a portion of the forward link signal for transmission on a single carrier of forward link signal 32. In the exemplary embodiment, a pilot signal is transmitted to allow for coherent demodulation of the signal by the receivers, which improves the performance of the receiver by providing a phase reference for demodulation. A set of pilot symbols known to both base station 30 and mobile station 40 are provided to Walsh spreader 60. Walsh spreader 60 spreads the pilot symbols by a Walsh sequence Wpilot. In the exemplary embodiment, Walsh sequences are used to distinguish  the<br><br>
channels of the data transmitted on a single CDMA carrier. The Walsh function can be either of a fixed number of symbols as is described in the IS-95 specification or it can be an orthogonal function that varies in length in accordance with the rate of the data to be transmitted on the channel as is described in the cdma2000 proposal and in U.S. Patent No. 5,751,761, entitled "System and Method for Orthogonal Spread Spectrum Sequence Generation in Variable Data Rate Systems", which is assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated by reference herein.<br>
The Walsh spread pilot symbols are provided to complex PN spreader 62.

Turning to FIG. 7, a simplified multi-carrier receiver which in the exemplary embodiment is provided in mobile station 40 is illustrated. In the exemplary embodiment, mobile station 40 is capable of simultaneously receiving forward link signals 32 transmitted on up to three carrier channels. It will be understood by one skilled in the art that the present invention can be extended to multi-carrier reception of an arbitrary number of channels. The received signal is provided to each of receive subsystems 105 which down convert and demodulate a different component of forward link signal 32 in accordance with a unique carrier frequency.<br>
The forward link signal 32 is received at antenna 100 and provided to receivers 102. Each of receivers 102a, 102b and 102c down convert, filter and amplify the received signal in accordance with a different frequency f1, f2, or f3, respectively. The down converted signals are provided to demodulators 104. In the exemplary embodiment, demodulators 104 demodulated each of the down converted signals in accordance with a code division multiple access (CDMA) modulation format. The implementation of demodulators 104 are described in detail in the aforementioned U.S. Patent No. 5,103,459. The demodulated components of forward link signal 32 are provided to multiplexer (MUX) 106 which re-assembles the transmitted data stream.<br>
In the present invention, mobile station 40 initially only uses a single receiver 102 and demodulator 104. Mobile station 40 tunes a selected receivers 102 to a preferred channel (300c, 300£ or 300i) and attempts to acquire the pilot signal at the preferred channel frequency using a corresponding one of demodulators 104. If sufficient correlation energy is detected, the acquisition is declared to be successful. The mobile station then still only down converting at the single frequency, demodulates, de-interleaves and decodes the Sync Channel message. From the Sync Channel message, mobile station 40 determines the center frequency of a multi-carrier system in the current frequency bands, if one exists, and the frequency of a single carrier system in the current frequency bands, if one exists.<br>
Mobile station 40 decides whether, it will operate in a multi-carrier mode or a smgle carrier mode. If mobile station 40 decides to operate in a multi-carrier mode, then mobile station 40 activates the RF circuitry additional   receivers   102,   tuning   to   the   appropriate   set   of   frequencies<br><br>
indicated in the Sync Channel message and begins to receive the forward link signal on a plurality of carrier frequencies. If mobile station 40 decides to operate in a single-carrier mode, then mobile station 40 tunes to the appropriate frequency indicated in the Sync Channel message and begins to receive the forward link signal on a single carrier frequency band.<br>
FIG. 8 illustrates the apparatus to receive forward link signal 32 in the exemplary embodiment of a CDMA communication system. Initially, mobile station 40 must tune to a preferred channel and attempt to acquire the pilot signal of that channel in the following manner.<br>
The forward link signals 32 are received at antenna 100 and provided to receiver 102. Receiver 102 tunes to a preferred channel frequency and down converts, filters and amplifies the received signal. In the exemplary embodiment, receiver 102 is a quaternary phase shift keyed receiver and outputs an in-phase (I) and Quadrature (Q) component of the received signal.<br>
The two components of the received signal are provided to complex PN despreader 112. Complex PN despreader 112 despreads the received signal in accordance with two pseudonoise sequences PN, and PNQ. In the exemplary embodiment, the PN despreading is a complex PN despreading as is described in detail in the aforementioned copending U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 08/886,604. In the exemplary embodiment, the PN sequences used to spread forward link signals 32 are generated using a generator polynomial that is common to all base stations 30. The spreading from base stations is distinguished from one another by the offset of the sequence.<br>
Control processor 128 provides offset hypotheses to complex PN despreader 112. Complex PN despreader 112 despreads the received signals in accordance with the PN offset hypotheses provided by control processor 128 as well as Wpilot,. The received signal is despread in accordance with the PN offset hypothesis and the resultant signal is provided to pilot filter 114. Pilot filter 114 despreads the signal from complex PN despreader 112 in accordance with an orthogonal sequence VVpilot, and low pass filters the result of complex despreader 112 In the exemplary embodiment, the Walsh sequence comprising of all I's is used to channel the pilot signal.<br>
The resultant signals from pilot filter 114 are provided to energy detector 118 which sums the squares of the resultant samples from pilot filter 114 to provide a received pilot energy value. The received pilot energy value   is provided   to  control   processor 128, where  it  is compared   to   a<br><br>
predetermined threshold value. If the computed energy exceeas the threshold acquisition is declared to be successful and the mobile station begins to receive the Sync Channel message. If the energy falls below the threshold value, then the acquisition is declared unsuccessful and the next PN hypothesis is provided by control processor 128 to complex PN despreader 112. The method and apparatus for searching PN offsets in a CDMA communication system is described in detail in U.S. Patent No. 5,644,591, entitled "Method And Apparatus For Performing Search Acquisition In A CDMA Communication System", which is assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated by reference herein. If exhausting the possible PN offset hypotheses, the received pilot energy fails to exceed the threshold value, then control processor sends message to receiver 102 to begin down converting the received signal at a different preferred frequency channel.<br>
Upon successful acquisition of a pilot channel on a preferred channel frequency, mobile station 40 demodulates and decodes the Sync Channel message. The received signal from receiver 102 is despread using the PN offset determined in the pilot search algorithm. The pilot signal is processed by pilot filter 114 as described above.<br>
The PN despread signal is also provided to Walsh despreader 116. N alsh despreader 116 despreads the received signal in accordance with a Nalsh code sequence Wchan. When demodulating the Sync Channel, the Nchan is Walsh sequence allocated for the transmission of the Sync Channel nessage. Walsh despreader 116 despreads the signal components in iccordance with the orthogonal sequence Wchan and provides the result to lot product circuit 120.<br>
Vs forward link signal 32 traverse the propagation path to mobile station 40, n unknown phase component is introduced into the received signal. Dot product circuit 120 computes the projection of the received signal onto the eceived pilot signal to provides a scalar result without the phase errors, he implementation of dot product circuits for coherent demodulation are cell known in the art and a method and apparatus for performing the dot roduct procedure is described in detail in U.S. Patent No. 5,506,865, entitled Pilot Carrier Dot Product Circuit" which is assigned to the assignee of the resent invention and is incorporated by reference herein.<br>
The scalar outputs from dot product circuit 120 are provided to lultiplexer 122 which combines the two received streams into a signal data ream. The data stream from multiplexer 122 is provided to de-interleaver<br><br>
124 which reorders the received symbols in accordance with a predetermined de-interleaving format. The reordered symbols are provided to decoder 126 which decodes the symbols of the Sync Channel message to provide the received Sync Channel message.<br>
The received Sync Channel message is provided to contml processor 128. In the present invention, control processor 128 determines from the Sync Channel message the channel frequency for the primary overhead channel of the single carrier system or the center frequency of the multi-carrier system. In response to the Sync Channel message, control processor 128 initiates the correct number of receive subsystems 105 and tunes them to the appropriate channels to receive forward link signal 32.<br>
