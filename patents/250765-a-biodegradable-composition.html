				<td>REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims priority to United States Provisional Application Serial No. 60/309,318.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to increasing the breathability of a biodegradable polymer film.<br>
It is desirable for films that are used in disposable applications including, e.g., personal hygiene, to be breathable and to exhibit good "hand," i.e., softness. Breathabihty refers to the ability of moisture or water vapor to diffuse through a medium, e.g., a film or garment. The moisture vapor transmission rate of a film is generally related to the breathabihty of the film.<br>
Various biodegradable polymers have been developed in an effort to enhance the disposal of waste generated by personal hygiene articles and disposable diapers in particular. These biodegradable polymers degrade under compost conditions into organic components such as carbon dioxide and water.<br>
Some of these biodegradable polymers have high viscosity. As a result, it is difficult to process these biodegradable polymers under standard hot melt conditions and to coat thin films using these biodegradable polymers.<br>
U.S. 5,625,029 (Hubbs et al.) discloses poly(3-hydroxyalkanoates) thermoplastic polymers that are described as being biodegradable, and blends of the poly(3-hydroxyalkanoates) with aliphatic-aromatic copolyester.<br>
U.S. 5,70,344 (Edgington et al.) discloses a tackifymg resin that is based on polyester derived from 2-propanoic acid and is described as being biodegradable and compostable. Edgington et al. also disclose biodegradable compostable thermoplastic resins. Edgington et al disclose that the tackifying resin can be combined with biodegradable and compostable polymer or resins to form adhesive compositions including, e.g., hot melt adhesives and hot melt pressure sensitive adhesives. Edgington et al. further disclose small molecule compostable plasticizers that can be combined with the compostable thermoplastic resins and tackifying resins.<br>
U.S. 5,988,505 (Brink) discloses compositions that include thermoplastic elastomers and microporous inorganic fillers. The film of which is described as being capable of exhibiting a moisture vapor transmission rate of at least 200 g mil/m2/day. Brink discloses thermoplastic elastomers that include copolyesters, polyamides, and polyurethanes. Examples of specifically disclosed copolyesters include poly(tetramtheylene gluatarate-co-therephthalate-co-diglycolate, poly(tetramethylene glutarate-co-terephthalate, polyethylene succinate-co-terephthalate), poly(tetramethylene succinate-co-terephthalate), and poly(tetramethylene adipate-co-terephthalate.<br>
EP 0 963,837 Al, EP 0 963 760 Al and EP 0 964 026 Al describe thermoplastic compositions that include thermoplastic polymer and plasticizer, and are capable of forming moisture vapor permeable films.<br>

about 10 % by weight to about 25 % by weight, most preferably from about 10 % by weight to about 15 % by weight based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
The composition can also include breathable thermoplastic polymers, i.e., thermoplastic polymers that are capable of forming a film having a moisture vapor transmission rate of at least 200 g/m2/day. Examples of useful breathable thermoplastic polymers include, e.g., polyether-polyester block copolymers commercially available under the HYTREL trade designation including HYTREL 8171 and HYTREL G3548 from DuPont (Wilmington, DE), and polyether-polyamide block copolymers available under the PEBAX trade designation from Atochem North America (Philadelphia, PA).

Suitable breathable water sensitive thermoplastic polymers include, e.g., crystalline water sensitive thermoplastic polymers and amorphous water sensitive thermoplastic polymers. The term "crystalline polymer" means those polymers that retain their rubbery elastomeric or flexible properties above the glass transition, until the melting temperature has been surpassed. Melting of the crystalline polymer is also accompanied by a loss of crystalline X-ray diffraction effects. The term "amorphous" means those polymers that gradually give way to a soft, extensible elastomeric phase, then to a gum and finally to a liquid with increasing temperature. Amorphous polymers exhibit a smooth transition between phases.<br>
Suitable water soluble crystalline thermoplastic polymers include the reaction product of a polyoxyalkylene glycol diamine and a dicarboxylic acid or dicarboxylic acid ester, where the polyoxyalkylene glycol diamine has the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where X is 2 or 3 and Y is 1 or 2.<br>
Examples of suitable polyoxyalkylene glycol diamines include triethylene glycol diamine, wherein X = 2 and Y=l, and tetraethylene glycol diamine, where X = 2 and Y = 2 and where X = 3 and Y = 2. Useful commercially available polyoxyalkylene glycol diamines are available under the trade designations JEFFAMINE XTJ-504 and<br>
JEFFAMINE EDR-192 (tetraethylene glycol diamine) from Huntsman Chemical Co. (Houston, Texas). A preferred diamine is 4,7,10-trioxatadecane-l,13-diamine (TTD diamine) where X=3 and Y=2, which is available from BASF (Parsippany, N.J.). Other useful amines include JEFFAMINE D-230, D-400, XTJ-500, XTJ-501 and XTJ-502 provided a chain terminator acid or amine is employed during the reaction, and/or additional ingredients such as waxes, tackifiers, crystalline polymers, and monoacids are subsequently combined with the reacted polyamide. When adipic acid is reacted with TTD diamine and JEFFAMINE D-230, for example, the resulting polyamide is relatively slow setting with respect to reacting adipic acid with TTD diamine alone.<br>
The polyoxyalkylene glycol diamine is reacted with an equal stochiometric ratio of a dicarboxylic acid. Suitable dicarboxylic acids are those having from 5 to 36 carbon atoms including adipic acid, pimelic acid, azelaic acid, sebacic acid, suberic acid,' dodecanedioic acid, terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, t-butyl isophthalic acid, dimer acid and mixtures thereof. The esters and anhydrides of these acids may also be used.<br>
Particularly useful water soluble polyether amides preferably have a melting point no greater than 190°C, which occurs when adipic acid is reacted with JEFFAMINE XTJ-504, when adipic acid is reacted with JEFFAMINE EDR-192, and when adipic acid is reacted with TTD diamine.<br>
The polyamide component can be combined with at least one ingredient selected from the group consisting of waxes, tackifying resins, crystalline polymers, monocarboxylic acids and mixtures thereof. The monocarboxylic acids and monoamines have been found to be useful not only as a reactant as previously described but also as an ingredient to be added after the polyamide is formed.<br>
A suitable crystalline water soluble polyamide is commercially available under the trade designation NP-2126 from H.B. Fuller Company (St. Paul, Minn.).   Other suitable crystalline water sensitive polymers include, e.g., polyethylene oxide from Union Carbide (Danbury, Conn.) and crystalline polyesters may also be suitable.<br>
Suitable amorphous water sensitive thermoplastic polymers include, e.g., polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyvinyl pyrrohdone/vinyl acetate, polyvinyl pyrrolidone/acrylic acid, polyetheroxazoline, and linear and branched water dispersible polyesters.<br>
Suitable commercially available amorphous water sensitive thermoplastic polymers include, e.g., polyvinyl alcohol available under the trade designations GROHSERAN L-301 and GROHSERAN L-302 from Nippon Groshei (Japan) and under the trade designation UNITIKA from Unitaka Ltd. (Japan); polyvinyl pyrrolidone available from BASF (Mount Olive, N.J.) and ISP (Wayne, N.J.); polyvinyl pyrrolidone/vinyl acetate copolymer and polyvinyl pyrrolidone/acrylic acid available under the trade designation ACRYLIDONE, both of which are available from ISP; polyethyloxazoline available under the trade designation PEOX from The Dow Chemical Company (Freeport, Tex.) and under the trade designation AQUAZOL from PCI Incorporated (Tucson, Ariz.), polyvinyl methyl ether available under the trade designation AMOBOND from Amoco Chemical Co., linear polyesters, polyacrylamide and water dispersible polyesters and copolyesters available under the trade designation EASTMAN AQ including EASTMAN AQ-14000, EASTMAN AQ-1950 and EASTMAN AQ-1045 from Eastman Chemical Company (Kingsport, Tennessee).<br>

Such polymers are saline and body fluid insoluble, yet dispersible in tap water. The Tg of the branched water dispersible copolyesters ranges from about -5°C to 7°C, whereas the linear polyesters have a Tg from about 30°C to about 60°C. Linear thermoplastic water dispersible polyesters are commercially available under the EASTMAN AQ series of trade designations including, e.g., EASTMAN AQ 35S (11,000 Mn), AQ 38S (11,000 Mn), AQ 48S (9,000 Mn), and AQ 55S (10,000 Mn) all from Eastman Chemical Company (Kingsport, Tennessee).

5,899,675 (Ahmed et al.), 5,863,979 (Ahmed et al.), 5,663,286 (Ahmed et al.), 5,869,596 (Ahmed et al.) and 6,103,809 (Ahmed et al.), and incorporated herein.<br>
The composition can also include biodegradable thermoplastic polymers including, e.g., polylactic acid polymers, polyesters made from 3-hydroxy butyric acid and 3-hydroxy valeric acid (which are available, e.g., under the BIOPOL trade designation from Monsanto Company (St. Louis, Missouri)), and polyester urethane thermoplastic polymers, all having a molecular weight (Mn) greater than 20,000, preferably greater than 30,000.<br>
Useful biodegradable polylactic acid thermoplastic polymers include high molecular weight linear polyesters of polylactic acid. Suitable commercially available polylactic acid thennoplastic polyesters are available from Cargill Inc. (Minnetonka, MN)-<br>
Useful biodegradable urethane polyesters can be prepared by reacting polyisocyanate, typically having two or three isocyanato groups on an aromatic or aliphatic nucleus, with polyester. Polyesters can be prepared by reacting a hydroxy compound having two or more hydroxy groups with an acid compound having two or more carboxyl groups to form the polyester backbone. Preferred hydroxy compounds include ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, 1,4-butene glycol, polymers made from ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, butylene oxide having two or more free hydroxyl groups and other similar diol, triol and polyol compounds. Useful acids that can be used in making the polyester urethanes of the invention include di- and tri-carboxylic acid substituted compounds including, e.g., oxalic acid, malic acid, maleic acid, phthalic acid, terephthalic acid and pyromellitic acid. Suitable polyesters can also be prepared from hydroxy-carboxylic acid containing compounds including, e.g., hydroxy acids such as lactic acid and hydroxybutyric acid and polymers such as polycaprolactone diols and polyethylene glycols. The hydroxy compounds and the acid compound can be reacted under condensation reaction conditions with the removal of water to form ester bonds resulting in the formation of the thermoplastic polyester resin.<br>
Thermoplastic polymer, when present, is preferably present in the composition in an amount of from about 5 % by weight to about 50 % by weight, more preferably from about 10 % by weight to about 40 % by weight, most preferably from about 15 % by weight to about 40 % by weight based on the total weight of the composition<br>
The composition can be provided in various forms including, e.g., adhesive compositions, binders, films, fibers, nonwovens, coatings (e.g., continuous or discontinuous), binders, impregnates, and laminates, and as a breathable layer (e.g., a sheet) in various application. The composition in its various forms is useful in a variety of applications including, e.g., textiles, textile laminates, disposable packaging including, e.g., food and product packaging, bed liners, mattress pads, mattress covers, disposable personal hygiene articles including, e.g., bandages, diapers, sanitary napkins, tampons and undergarment liners, other articles including, e.g., wound dressing, surgical drapes and surgical gowns.<br>
The composition can be applied to a substrate as a coating including, e.g., continuous and discontinuous coatings and films, using a variety of techniques including, e.g., hot melt coating, extrusion, spray (e.g., spiral spray) coating, depositing beads of composition, melt blowing, laminating, impregnating and combinations thereof.<br>
An example of a useful coating method includes rendering a composition flowable, i.e., melting the composition, and releasing the composition from a coating device, e.g., a slot die coater, onto a substrate, without contact between the coating device and the substrate. The method can provide a product having good tactile quality when the composition is applied at low and high coating weights. Thin coating weight reduces the stiffness of the coated material and provides a textile material that equates in softness to an uncoated textile material.  The method can also be used to provide soft materials with high coating weights. Useful coating methods are described, e.g., in U.S. 5,827,252, U.S. 6,120,887 and WO 99/28048, and incorporated herein.<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates one example of a method in which a first substrate 1 is advanced by the drive rolls past a series of idle rollers (2) to ensure the first substrate (1) is in proper alignment prior to approaching the coating device (3). The coating device (3) is located at a distance from the substrate (1) to be coated, the distance ranging from about 0.5 mm to about 20 mm depending on the properties of the composition (6) being coated. An optional second substrate (4) can be adhered to the coated surface of the first substrate (1) by means of a nip roll (5). When adherence to a second substrate (4) is intended, it is often preferred to position the nip roll (5) closer to the coating device (3) at a distance of about 25 cm from the coating device (3).<br>
The composition (6) exits the coating device (3) in the form of a continuous film (8).   When the composition (6) leaves the coating device (3) in the form of a film (8), it does not contact the substrate (1) immediately. Instead, it travels for a distance as a continuous film suspended above the substrate (1) without touching the substrate (1). The distance between the coating device and the substrate ranges from about 0.5 mm to about 20 mm. The distance is largely influenced by the viscosity of the composition being coated. Preferably the continuous film (8) travels in a substantially horizontal direction to contact the first substrate (1), i.e., the continuous film is directed in a horizontal direction and the substrate to be coated is directed in a vertical direction.<br>
The invention will now be described further by way of the following examples. All parts, ratios, percents and amounts stated in the Examples are by weight unless otherwise specified.<br>
EXAMPLES Test Procedures<br>
Test procedures used in the examples include the following.<br>
Moisture Vapor Transmission Tate (MVTR) Test Method<br>
Moisture vapor transmission rate is determined according to the water method of ASTM E96-95 Upright Cup Method entitled, "Standard Test Methods for Water Vapor Transmission of Materials," March 6,1995, and reported in g/m2/day (where 1 day is 24 hours). The sample film thickness is from 1 to 3 mils and the results are normalized to 1 mil.<br>
Components<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Control 1<br>
A thin film was prepared by coating molten neat EASTAR BIOCOPOLYESTER poly(tetramethylene adipate-co-terephthalate) polymer (Eastman Chemical Company, Kingsport, Tennessee) on a release liner at a temperature of from 175oC to 190oC.<br>
Control 2<br>
A thin film was prepared by coating molten neat EASTAR BIOCOPOLYESTER poly(tetramethylene adipate-co-terephthalate) polymer (Eastman Chemical Company) on a release liner at a temperature of from 175oC to 190oC.<br>
Examples 1-25<br>
Compositions were prepared by combining the components in the amounts (in units of % by weight) specified in Table 1, with mixing, at 375°F. Each composition was hot melt coated to form a film. The MVTR results set forth in Table 1 have been normalized to a film thickness of 1 mil. The films of Examples 1,3,4 and 6-25 were observed to be free of visible plasticizer bleeding. The film of Example 5 exhibited visible plasticizer bleeding and no MVTR was recorded.<br>
For Table 1, A = Benzoflex 2088 was used instead of Benzoflex 9-88 and NT = not tested.<br>
