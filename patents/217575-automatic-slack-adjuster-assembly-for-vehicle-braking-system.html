				<td>Field of invention:<br>
The present invention relates to an automatic slack adjuster assembly for vehicle braking system and more particularly to an automatic slack adjusting assembly of novel construction and mode of operation, which actuates the cam for brake application in fluid operated brakes of medium and heavy vehicles. The novel aspect of the present invention adjusts the slack automatically, yet does not affect the provision of manual adjustment of the braking parts.<br>
Background and Prior art references:<br>
The invention pertains to pneumatically powered brake system of medium and heavy vehicles. These vehicles invariably use internally expandable brake shoes lined with friction material and the braking effect is produced when these shoes make contact with a drum mounted on the driving or trailing wheels. The expansion of the brake shoes is done by S-profiled cams, which push the shoes out when the cam is rotated. The cam is rotated by lever arm at the end of which the force is applied by an air chamber, which gains its thrusting force, by compressed air. Hence, the name pneumatically operated brakes.<br>
As the vehicles run, the brake is applied several times, which causes the wear of the friction lining of the brake shoes along with that of brake drum. During course of time, the clearance between the brake shoes and drum starts getting enlarged due to this wear. The enlarged clearance which is hereto called "Slack" demands more cam rotation, which in turn, needs larger stroke of the air chamber. The air chamber stroke is limited. A situation may arise when the full air chamber stroke would fail to expand the brake shoes enough for effective braking.<br>
When the braking system of vehicle develops slack, it needs to be adjusted for effective braking. For carrying out this operation, the vehicle is to be grounded and adjustment to be made by trained mechanics or auto-work shops. This results in productive time loss. The slack adjuster is provided with Worm and Gear system in such a way that by rotating the Worm the s-cam also rotates and subsequently eliminates the slack i.e. the clearance developed between the brake shoes and the drum. The brake thus becomes effective again. This is normally termed as "brake adjustments".<br><br>
The vehicles need to be taken to a workshop for carrying out this brake adjustment which causes a loss of productive time of the vehicle. Any negligence, in getting the adjustment done in time, may also cause accidents due to non-effective braking. The brake adjustments are required to be done several times during the life of the brake linings, resulting in loss of several productive days. Besides the effectiveness of braking may also get impaired if timely adjustments are not carried out.<br>
To circumvent the problem of manual adjustment of brakes periodically, few manufacturers of Slack/Brake Adjuster have incorporated a system to automatically adjust the slack or the clearance between the brake shoes and the drum. These systems use several parts like small gears, racks, coil springs, clutches and retainers, etc. The applicants of this patent have also designed an Automatic Slack Adjuster but using very few parts and no clutch system. The initial mounting and setting the assembly on the brake system of vehicle has also been simplified and avoids the necessity of lifting pauls or work against unidirectional clutches.<br>
In patent number GB114696.5, the slack sensing is from external anchoring link blotted at the chassis. Use of clutches, gear trains secondary and primary worms-, results in slack adjustment.<br>
'In patent number US535Q043, slack adjustment is incorporated with sensing by Clevis, rotation of worm by heavy spring loaded clutch and rotor, internal worm mounted cam, pusher and springs loaded stopper. The system as described in the cited patent is extremely complex and makes the system cumbersome.<br>
In publication number WO03083322, the, applicant takes slack sensing from external anchoring at chassis, Worm mounted spring loaded clutch connected to the secondary worm and gear to provide rotation to the primary worm. Such prior devices had certain disadvantages as mentioned below:<br>
Higher cost<br>
Too bulky and needs modifications for fitment or need external anchoring<br>
bracket with a chassis.<br>
Use too many parts and miniature clutch systems which tend the wear out<br>
and malfunction.<br>
The certain devices could not be sealed properly against ingress of water /<br>
water mists and dust thereby rendering the parts to wear and seize.<br>
Some devices are not interchangeable for left and right side application and<br>
the direction of thrust.<br><br>
Objects of the invention<br>
Accordingly, the primary object of the invention is to provide a novel automatic slack adjuster in vehicle braking system.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a uni-directional worm-rotating device so that the worm once rotated does not revert to its original position. Another object of the present invention is to provide a constant incremental adjustment through 360° of the cam rotation though normally the cam does not rotate more than 120° during the lifetime of the brake lining.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide nearly constant free movement of the lever housing to a predetermined angular range within which the automatic mechanism remains dormant thereby avoiding over-adjustment.<br>
Yet, another object of the present invention is to maintain optimum clearance between brake lining and drum surface.<br>
Another object of the present invention is the interchangeability for right hand and left-hand application.<br>
Another object of the  present  invention  is  easy  adaptability,   initial  mounting  and adjustment in the existing brake system without alteration and additions. Another object of the present invention is to provide a construction, which could be sealed against the ingress of dust and moisture, and to retain the lubricants inside the assembly.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention leads to rotation of the worm, which in turn rotates the engaging gear coupled to the s-cam shaft. The rotation of the worm is to take place only when the clearance between the brake shoes and drum increases beyond a predetermined extent. The worm-rotating device also needs to be unidirectional so that the worm once rotated does not revert to its original position. In order to achieve this basic requirement the worm has been designed with an integrated ratchet cylinder, which can be rotated only in one direction by a paul. The Linear movement of the paul is given by an actuator rod, linked by a clevis to the push rod of the air chamber which actuates the brake. Brief description of the figures<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to slack adjuster, which automatically adjusts<br>
the slack between the brake drum and the brake lining riveted to the brake shoes. The<br>
said brake shoes expand with the rotation of the S-profiled cam.<br>
In figure 6, the said automatic slack adjuster assembly for vehicle braking system<br>
comprises of<br>
(a)	a lever housing (1) accommodating a worm-wheel means having splined bore to receive camshaft, said worm-wheel means comprising a worm in functional relationship with a wheel (3);<br>
(b)	a worm shaft (4) having ratchet cylinder (5) portion, enmeshed in said worm at right angle to the axis of the wheel;<br>
(c)	a paul (6) positioned over the ratchet cylinder (5) portion of the worm shaft (4) inside a machined guideway in the housing (1);<br>
(d)	a leaf spring (10) located on one end of the machined guideway pressing down the said paul;<br>
(e)	an actuator rod (7) linked to the said paul (6) runs inside guide (9), opposite to the end of the leaf spring guideway, provides linear motion to the paul (6); acuator rod (7) means connected to an end connector, said end connector being connected to a clevis (2) by means of a clevis pins (2B),<br>
(f)	the clevis (2) is attached externally to the said Lever Housing (1) by clevis pin (2A), and<br>
(g)	a force exerting means, connected to the said clevis pin (2A) for providing necessary force.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the wheel in the worm-wheel means is a gearwheel.<br><br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, said assembly is sealed using a sealing assembly, said sealing assembly comprising cover (14); gasket (12); O rings (13); worm shaft seal (11); actuator rod O-Ring (15) and bellows (not shown). In another embodiment of the present invention, said sealing assembly avoids ingress of dust and moisture and retains lubricants inside the assembly.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, paul is a special engineered, material<br>
having single tooth.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the uni-directional paul and ratchet<br>
drive is utilized to achieve the adjustment of slack automatically in cam operated vehicle<br>
brakes.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, off-setting of paul tooth away from the<br>
center line of the ratchet cylinder determines the amount of angular rotation of the lever<br>
housing during which automatic adjustment is not desired.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, wherein the tooth position in the paul is<br>
off set so that the paul does not engage with the ratchet cylinder for a pre-determined<br>
angular movement of the said lever housing.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, wherein the predetermined angular<br>
movement is preferably in the range of 12°. to 16°<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the paul is a special engineered toothed<br>
plate.<br>
In Figure 4, the rotation of the camshaft through angle A when the brake adjuster<br>
assembly is pushed by the air chamber through push rod and clevis is shown. The<br>
actuator rod in brake applied position gets pulled out and in turn places the Paul (6) in<br>
engaging position with Ratchet Cylinder (5) teeth as shown in Figure 6. When the brake<br>
is released and the brake adjuster reverts into the initial position by the air chamber, the<br>
Paul (6) rotates the worm shaft, which in turn rotates Worm wheel (3) thereby adjusting<br>
the slack. The offsetting of Paul (6) tooth ensures that its engagement with Ratchet<br>
cylinder (5) only after a certain angular movement of the brake adjuster assembly. When<br>
slack is not developed, the brake adjuster angular movement is less which does not<br>
allow the Paul (6) to ride over the Ratchet cylinder (5) and therefore the Worm Shaft (4)<br>
does not rotate and thereby avoids the over adjustment to take place. When the angle is<br>
increased, which happens when the slack is developed, the adjustment takes place.<br><br>
Thus, the mechanism maintains the desired clearance between the brake lining and the drum.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the unidirectional Paul (6) and Ratchet (5) drive is utilized to achieve the adjustment to Slack automatically-in cam operated vehicle brakes.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, off-setting of Paul (6) tooth away from the center line of the Ratchet Cylinder determines the amount of angular rotation of the Lever Housing (1) during which automatic adjustment is not desired. In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the application of unidirectional Paul and ratchet drive to achieve the adjustment of slack automatically in pneumatically operated vehicle brakes.<br>
The Slack Adjuster assembly is mounted over the cam shaft splines. It is linked to the push rod of the air chamber by means of a clevis having two holes, one big and other small as given in FIG. - 4. When compressed air is fed to the air chamber, the linear outward motion of the push rod gives angular movement to the slack adjuster assembly which in turn rotates the cam shaft as give in FIG - 5, thereby expanding, the brake shoes for brake application. It is evident from the figures that the distance between the small clevis hole to the worm axis gets extended. This extension pulls out the'actuator rod. The FIG - 4 shows the superimposed view of the slack adjuster assembly Tn "initial" or home position and in "brake applied position. The extended distance or the arnount by which the actuator rod gets pulled out is in direct proportion to the angle "A" of-the cam shaft rotation. Lesser the angle lesser is the pull out amount of the actuator rod. The actual construction details of the slack adjuster assembly are shown in FIG -5 and FIG -6. FIG -5 shows the initial of the home position and FIG - 6 shows when the actuator rod gets pulled out to the maximum. In this position the paul tooth gets engaged with the ratchet cylinder on the worm and when the assembly retracts back to the "home" position, the paul pushes the ratchet thereby making the worm to rotate. The worm then rotates the gear and the gear, coupled to the camshaft, rotates the cam. Initially, when the brake linings are new, the clearance between the brake shoes and drum is the minimum and requires lesser angular movement of the slack adjuster for effective brake application. The tooth position in the paul is sufficiently offset-sb that for movement up to about 12/14 degrees does not make the paul tooth engage .with the ratchet. In this range, the paul body just slides over ratchet teeth. The leaf spring allows<br><br>
the paul to lift-up for engagement but also exerts sufficient force to avoid its disengagement when operating.<br>
As the wear on lining and drum takes place the clearance between the brake shoes and drum increase causing the arm movement exceeding 14°, which also includes the angular shift caused by the flexing the brake systems parts such as cam shaft, shoes, bearings clearances etc.<br>
As and when this happens the paul comes into function and reduces the clearance by rotating the cam shaft till the arm movement falls below 14°. The automatic adjustments therefore remain dormant till the arm movement again exceeds 14°. With the automatic adjustment in function the arm movements are limited around 14° / 16° only and hence automatically control the air chamber stroke. This results in reduced air consumption and limited flexing of the air chamber diaphragm. Other advantages include<br>
Gain in productive days of vehicles because manual adjustments are not<br>
needed.<br>
Elimination of brake adjustment costs.<br>
Uniformity of brake  performance  because the  clearance  are  maintained<br>
optimally.<br>
Greater reliability.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
