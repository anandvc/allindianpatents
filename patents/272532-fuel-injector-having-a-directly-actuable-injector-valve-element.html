				<td>Description Title<br>
Fuel Injector with directly actuated Injection Valve Element<br>
The invention relates to a fuel injector for internal combustion engines as per the generic description of claim 1.<br>
State-of-the-Art of Technology<br>
A fuel injector with directly actual injection valve element and with a single stage transmission of the actuator lift with a pulling actuator for opening the jet needle is described in Patent Document DE 10 2004 005 452 A1. In this case, an actuator-side coupler piston actuated by means of an actuator acts on an interacting space and a coupler piston connected to a jet needle acting on a buncher space. The interacting space aqd the buncher space are hydraulically connected through a channel. In so doing, the channel is located in a shim washer, which is provided between an injector body and a jet body.<br>
During actuation of the actuator, high accelerations occur and at the end- stroke/lift of the actuator corresponding vibrations of the actuator also occur, which are transmitted through the hydraulic spaces on to the jet needle, as a result of which the jet needle also vibrates. These vibrations lead to fluctuations in the quantity of injection, since the throttle cross section of the jet needle alters itself on the jet needle seat.<br>
The task of the above invention is to present a compactly designed fuel injector, in which the transmissions of the vibrator of the actuator/lift are suppressed on the jet needle and a quick opening and closing of the jet needle continues to be maintained nevertheless.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The task of the invention is solved with a fuel injector having the characteristic property of claim 1. The choke/restrictor provided between the interacting space of the actuator and the buncher space of the jet needle in the channel with minimum two segments with different flow cross-sections, in which the segment with the smaller flow cross-section is facing the interacting phase and the segment with the larger flow cross section is facing the buncher space, ensures that the vibrations of the actuator during the transmission of the stroke/lift on to the jet needle lift are suppressed and/or quickly absorbed.<br>
The advantages of the further designs of the invention are possible through the measures of the sub-claims.<br>
Especially useful design form for guaranteeing a rapid stroke transmission lies therein if a third segment is designed upstream of the first segment to the interacting space and a fourth segment is designed upstream of the second segment to the buncher space, and if these two segments have essentially the same flow cross-section, which is in turn larger than the larger flow cross section of the second segment. It is advantageous if the channel is provided eccentrically with reference to the central axis of the buncher space in the shim washer. An especially effective absorption and a quick hydraulic transmission between the interacting space and the buncher space is achieved if the ratio of the smaller flow cross section of the first segment of the throttle to the cross section area of the buncher space is between 0,05 and 0,1, preferably between 0,075 up to 0,08. It is further more advantageous if the shim washer has at least a connecting channel which hydraulically joins a high pressure space interlinked with the high pressure connection with the jet needle space, where in the shim washer several connecting channels arranged in a circular shape around the central axis of the buncher space are visualized.<br>
Design Example<br>
A design example of the invention is illustrated in the drawing and is further described below:<br>
The figures show:<br>
Figure 1 A sectional illustration of a combustion-side part of an invention- based fuel injector.<br>
Figure 2 A sectional illustration of an intermediate plate and<br>
Figure 3 An enlarged section X of the intermediate plate in figure 2<br>
The fuel injector illustrated in figure 1 has an injector housing 10 with an injection valve element which projects together with a jet body 12 in a combustion chamber of a combustion engine. In jet body 12, a jet needle 13 is introduced in an axially slidable manner. On the jet body 12 at the tip of the jet needle 13, a jet needle seat 14 is designed which is located downstream of the injection jet 15 designed in the injection direction in the jet body 12 and projecting/protruding in the combustion chamber. The jet needle seat 14 is designed upstream of a jet needle pressure chamber 16 in the injection valve element in injection direction, to which a jet needle side pressure shoulder 17 designed on the jet needle 13 is exposed.<br>
The injector housing 10 has a pressure chamber 18 which is connected with a connection 9 to a high pressure system, for example to a common rail system of a diesel injection device (not illustrated). A piezo-actuator 20 Is provided in the high pressure chamber 18 which is firmly jointed to an actuator-side coupler piston 21. The actuator-side coupler piston 21 has a guide/pilot segment 22 and a ring-shaped collar 23. On the guide segment 22, a first valve sleeve 30 Is provided such that it can be axially slided, on which a pressure spring 25 engages itself, which supports itself on the collar 23 of the actuator-side coupler piston 21. In order that the relatively bng. piezo-actuator 20 does not tilt the coupler piston 21 in the high pressure chamber 18 duhng its length alteration, for example, the valve sleeve 30 Is provided additionally with bearing/guidance surface on a guidance bore 26 in axial direction within the injector body 10 (not illustrated).<br>
Between the injector body 10 and the jet body 12, an intermediate plate 40 is arranged which is tightened with the use of a clamping nut 41 hydraullcally leak- proof. The intermediate plate 40 for example has minimum two connection channels 42 through which the high pressure chamber 18 is hydraulically connected with the jet needle pressure chamber 16. The first slide valve sleeve 30 presses with a sealing edge 31 against an actuator side front area 43 designed on the choke/throttle plate 40. Thereby, within the first valve sleeve 30, a coupler space 32 builds itself, to which the actuator-side coupler piston 21 is exposed with a pressure surface 27.<br>
A jet needle-side coupler piston 34 is formed on the jet needle 13, on which an additional valve sleeve 36 is provided such that it can be axially slided. The additional valve sleeve 36 presses with an additional sealing edge 37 against a jet needle side face surface 44 of the intermediate plate 40. The press force for the additional sealing edge 37 is brought about with the use of an additional pressure spring 28. <br>
Within the additional valve sleeve 36, a control chamber 38 is formed to which the jet needle side coupler piston 34 with a pressure surface 39 is exposed. In order to realize a stroke/lift transmission from actuator-side coupler piston 21 on the jet-needle side coupler piston 34 of (&gt;1), it is necessary that the dia of the actuator-side coupler piston 21 or the pressure surface 27 is larger than the dia of the jet-needle side coupler piston 34 or additional pressure surface 39.<br>
Through the choke plate 50, a channel 40 runs which connects the interacting space 32 with the buncher space 38 hydraulically. The channel 50, located eccentrically from the central axis 49 of the buncher space 38 in the intermediate plate 40, has a hydraulic choke 51 (figure 2).<br>
The interacting space 32 and the buncher space 38 act as transmission chambers in which the stroke/lift of the actuator side coupler piston 21 is subjected to a greater transmission because of the larger pressure surface 27 as against the smaller pressure surface 39 of the jet needle side coupler piston 34. The fuel serving the transmission is transferred as hydraulic medium through the , channel 50 with choke 51. In order to gyarantee both a quick as weW. as absorbing transmission of the fuel, the choke 51 has, as per figure 3, a first segment 52 with a smaller flow cross section and a second segment 53 with a larger flow cross section, where the first segment 52 with the smaller flow cross section faces the interacting space 32 and the second segment 53 with the larger flow cross section the buncher space 38. Further, a third segment 54 is provided upstream of the first segment 52 towards the interacting space 32, and a fourth segment 55 upstream of the second segment 53 towards the buncher space 38. The segments 54 and 55 have essentially the same flow cross section, which is in turn larger than the larger flow cross section of the second segment 53. Further, between segment 55 allotted to the buncher space 38 and the second segment 53 of the choke 51 a conically flowing transition 56 is formed narrowing itself towards the second segment 53.<br>
Decisive for an effective absorption of the vibration is also the ratio of the dia or the cross section area of the choke 51 and the dia of the cross section area of the buncher space 38. It was found that the vibration of the jet needle 13 is effectively suppressed because of the transmission of the actuator stroke, if the ratio of the area AD of the smaller flow cross section of the first segment 52 of the choke 51 to the cross section area AK of the buncher space 38 is between 0,05 and 0,1, ideally 0,075 to 0,08.<br>
The injection with the fuel injector is initiated with a pulling/drawing piezo-actuator 20. For this purpose, in closed condition of the injector jet 15, there is a tension on the piezo-actuator 20. For initiating the injection, the tension is reduced or set at 0, so that the piezo-actuator 20 shortens itself and thereby a pulling lift is initiated with the actuator side coupler piston 21. This type of triggering in fuel injectors is also referred to as inverse triggering of the piezo-actuator 20.<br>
The pulling stroke realized from the actuator side coupler piston 21 leads to an enlargement of the interacting space 32 as a result of which the pressure in the interacting space 32 falls below the rail-pressure or system pressure. The falling pressure in interacting space 32 is transmitted through channel 50 with the choke 51 to the buncher space 38, as a result of which the rail pressure acting on the pressure shoulder 17 in the jet needle pressure chamber 16 is higher than the pressure acting on the pressure surface 39 in the buncher space 38. By virtue of the fact that the pressure surface 39 is smaller than the pressure surface 27 the jet needle 13 with a larger stroke/lift than the stroke/lift of the piezo-actuator 20 is lifted up from the jet needle seat 14. Through the lifting of the jet needle 13 from the jet needle .seat 14, tfie injection jet 15 become 3, so that through the injector 15 the fuel is injected with the rail pressure or system pressure prevalent in the jet needle pressure chamber 16.<br>
For closing the sealing sea 14, the piezo-actuator 20 is impinged with a tension, which brings about a length elongation of the piezo-actuator 20, as a result of which the actuator side coupler piston 21 presses in the interacting space 32, and enhances there the pressure. The pressure enhancement is transmitted through the channel 50 and the choke 51 in the buncher space 38, which acts on the additional pressure area 39 of the jet needle side coupler piston 35. Thereby, the jet needle 13 is again placed in the jet needle seat 14, supported through the pressure spring 28.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
