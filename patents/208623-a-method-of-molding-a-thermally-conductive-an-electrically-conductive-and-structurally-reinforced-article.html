METHOD OF MOLDING A REINFORCBD ARTICLE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to an in roved method of molding a reinforced article from composite material-   More specifically, the present invention relates to a method of molding a thermally and/or electrically conductive article that is easily moldable while yielding conductivities many times greater than prior, art molding methods even extolling known materials.  Also, the present  invention provides  for  a method  of molding  a structurally improved reinforced article from a composite material-It should understood that the terra "reinforced article  refers to an article that is loaded with any type of filler material, be it electrically  or  thermally  conductive  or  of  high  strength. Therefore,  the  method  of  the  present  invention  relates  to electrically   conductive   compositions,   thermally  conductive compositions and structurally reinforced compositions.<br>
In the electronics industry, it has been well known to employ metallic materials for thermal and electrical conductivity applications, such as heat dissipation for cooling semiconductor device packages, grounding applications, and the like. For these applications, such as heat sinks, the metallic material typically is tooled or machined from bulk metals into the desired configuration. However, such metallic conductive articles are typically very heavy, costly to machine and are susceptible to corrosion. Further, the geometries of machined metallic heat dissipating articles are very limited to the inherent limitations associated with the machining or tooling process. As a result, the requirement of use of metallic materials which are machined into the desired form, place severe limitations on component design particular when it is known that certain geometries, simply by virtue of their design, would realize better thermal efficiency, for example, but are not attainable due to the limitations in machining metallic articles.<br>
It is widely known in the prior art that improving the overall geometry of a heat dissipating article/ can greatly enhance the overall performance of the article even if the material is the same. Therefore, the need for improved heat sink geometries and lower cost necessitated an alternative to the machining of bulk metallic materials. To meet this need, atten5&gt;ts have been made in the prior art to provide molded compositions that include conductive filler material therein to provide the necessary thermal<br><br>
conductivity. The ability to mold a conductive composite ensiled the design of more complex part geometries to realize improved performance of the part- Similarly, the electrical conductivity of a given article may also be greatly improved if it capable of being molding. For example, the shapes and configurations could be greatly improved by molding the article to realize improved electrical conductivity. In addition, a moldable composite with high structural integrity with high-strength filler material therein is also known.<br>
The attempts in the prior art included the employment of a polymer base matrix loaded with a granular material, such as boron nitride grains. Also, attempts have been made to provide a polymer base matrix loaded with flake-like filler material. These attempts are, indeed, moldable into complex geometries but still do not approach the desired performance levels found in metallic machined parts. It is a known in the art that filler material, particularly high aspect ratio filler material, will align parallel with the flow path of the base matrix within a mold. Therefore, these conductive composite materials must be molded with extreme precision due to concerns of filler alignment during the molding process. This is of concern when the filler material is nonsymmetrical or when there is an aspect ratio greater than 1:1 of the thickness to the length of the filler. Even with precision molding and design, inherent problems of fluid turbulence, collisions with the mold due to complex product geometries make it impossible to position the non-symmetrical filler ideally thus causing the composition to perform far less than desirable. This problem is exacerbated when the filler has an aspect ratio greater than 10:1. This is a serious concern because filler is commonly employed that has an aspect ratio up to 40:1.<br>
Moreover, the entire matrix of the composition must be satisfactory because heat transfer is a bulk property rather than a direct path property such as the transfer of electricity. A direct path is needed to conduct electricity. . However, heat is trcinsferred in bulk where the entire volume of the body is employed for the transfer- Therefore, even if a highly conductive narrow conduit is provided through a much lower conductive body, the heat transfer would not be as good as a body which is consistently marginally conductive throughout the entire body. Therefore, consistency of the thermal conductivity of the entire matrix of the composite body is essential for overall high thermal conductivity. Moreover, the proper alignment of the loaded filler material,<br><br>
particularly high aspect ratio filler, within the polymer base is of critical importance. When the composite is relayed for electrical conductivity, the arrangement at filler therein is also of critical importance in that an excessive number of discontinuities in the filler will result in poor electrical transmission.<br>
In view of the foregoing, there is a demand for an in roved method of molding reinforced articles of composite material which are thermally and/or electrically conductive. There is also a demand for articles of composite material to be formed containing or reinforced with high strength filler material for higher structural integrity. In addition, there is a demand for a method of molding that can fully   the employment of composite polymer and filler material; namely, the proper alignment and positioning of filler material with the base polymer matrix. There is also a demand for such a method to enable such polymer and high aspect ratio filler compositions to be easily molded into complex product geometries. There is also a demand for such a method of molding to form an article that exhibits thermal and electrical conductivity as close as possible to purely metallic conductive materials while being relatively low in cost to manufacture.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention preserves the advantages of prior art methods for molding reinforced articles from conductive plastic compositions. In addition, it provides new advantages not found in currently known methods and overcomes many disadvantages of such currently available methods.<br>
The invention is generally directed to the novel and maguey method of molding a thermally conductive article from thermally conductive plastic composite material that has particular application in heat sink applications and particularly where heat must be moved from one region to another to avoid device failure. In addition, the method of the present invention can provide articles that have particular application in the electronics industry as it can provide a moldable member that is electrically conductive. The method of the present invention enables a composite material of polymer material and conductive filler, such as a high aspect ratio filler, to molded in the most conductive efficient manner while still maintaining low manufacturing costs. By selection of the materials according to the application at hand, high thermal and/or electrical conductivity may be achieved. In that connection, the selection of a high strength material as the<br><br>
filler, ccin achieve a molded reinforced article of high structural integrity while still be moldable, such as by injection molding.<br>
A method of molding, such as by injection molding, a thermally, electrically conductive and/or structurally reinforced article is provided. If an electrically conductive filler is employed, an article with electrical properties, such as electrical conductivity or EMI shielding, for example, Ccin be achieved. If a thermally conductive filler material is employed, a thermally conductive article will be achieved. If a high strength filler is employed, such as carbon, a structurally reinforced article can be achieved according to the method of the present invention. It is also possible that a filler is selected that exhibits all of the electrical, thermal and strength properties to provide a multipurpose molded article.<br>
A mold assembly is first provided which is capable of forming an article of a desired configuration. For a thermal application employing thermally conductive filler, the initial location of contact on the article with the heat generating surface is then determined. An input gate is formed in the mold assembly at the initial location of contact. The optimum heat flow path through the article is determined. A termination location of the heat or electrical flow path is determined. Polymer, loaded with nonsymmetrical conductive filler, is introduced into the mold assembly via the input gate. Venting is provided in the mold assembly at the termination location of the heat or electrical flow path. Polymer is positioned in the mold assembly with the conductive filler being substantially parallel and aligned with the flow path. Finally, the molded article is ejected from the mold assembly. With the molding method of the present invention, thermal conductivity of articles may be increased several times over the conductivity realized with conventional molding methods by properly aligning the filler material within the molding article body. The foregoing method is employed when using electrically conductive or high strength filler. For electrical .filler, the desired electrical flow path through the article is determined and the appropriate input and output gating is set to maintain the desired path to ensure that the filler is aligned along the determined electrical flow path. Similarly, a structural filler may be employed where the point of high stress is determined and the gating cued venting is set to ensure proper alignment of reinforcing filler to prevent fracture.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
The present invention relates to a method of molding a reinforced composition. It should be understood that the present method may be employed to form articles that are both thermally and electrically conductive and/or structural reinforced. The type of reinforcement, i.e. thermal, electrical or structural, realized by the method of the present invention is achieved through the selection of certain materials to suit the given application and reinforcement recjuirements.<br>
In the present invention, the method of molding, such as by injection molding, a reinforced article etalons a composite material of a base polymer matrix loaded with a filler material which is preferably high aspect ratio filler such as aluminum, alumina, copper, magnesium, PITCH-based carbon and brass material formed into either elongated fibers, strands, rice or fleeces. The foregoing materials would be suitable to achieve thermal or electrical properties for the net-shape molded article which is an article that, once molded, is ready for use without the need for further machining such as what is required in compression molded articles.  As shown in Fig. 1, a prior art composite material 2,<br><br>
which is readily commercially available, is shown. In particular, this prior art composite material 2 generally shows a base matrix of polymer 4, for example, loaded with non-symmetrical filler material 8. This composition is shown in enlarged detail for clarity and ease of illustration.<br>
As can be understood, the loading of filler 8, which may be thermally conductive, electrically conductive, or structurally enhancing, in a polymer base matrix 4 will render the material conductive while permitting the material to be moldable. When employed as a thermal conductor, the material 2 must thermally transfer heat from, for example, side X to side Y of the material. During this transfer, heat must travel from heat conductive filler member to the adjacent heat conductive filler member to travel the path from X to Y. The selected filler 8 in Fig. 1 is preferably high aspect ratio fiber or strands to reduce the number of interfaces between several filler members as well as the non-conductive polymer residing therebetween. The more interfaces that heat must cross curd the more polymer the heat must pass through, the more degraded the thermal conductivity will be. Further, too much loading of filler material would prevent the base polymer from wetting • out resulting in undesirable small air pockets in the finished molded product.<br>
An ideal arrangement of the composition of Fig. 1 includes a high aspect ratio filler 8 within a polymer base matrix 4. It is critical to align the high aspect ratio filler as parallel as possible to the thermal flow path to effectively decrease the overall number of interfaces and volume of base polymer over which the heat must travel. Fig. 1 illustrates a realistic arrangement of filler 8 with the base polymer matrix where the filler 8 is generally aligned parallel with one another and aligned with the general desired thermal flow direction from sides X to Y. However, as can be seen in Fig. 1, a transverse flow path from side A to side B is highly undesirable because of the increased number of thermal interfaces and increased volume of non-conductive polymer through which the heat must travel. Therefore, it is critical that the filler 8 be aligned properly with a thermally conductive article; namely, in parallel with the thermal flow path. In a common application is possible that the thermal conductivity of path X-Y be as much as 8 times the thermal conductivity of the path A-B transverse to the alignment of the filler. For example, the thermal conductivity of path A-B could be 2 W/m*&gt;K while the thermal conductivity of path X-Y is over 16 W/make.  Similar problems are<br><br>
encountered when attempting to make the composition as electrically conductive or structurally enhanced as possible.<br>
The goal of aligning the reinforcing filler parallel and aligned with the thermal or electrical flow or structural stress lines is often difficult to achieve due to complexity of the geometry of the part to be molded. As stated earlier, one of the primary reasons for employing a conductive plastic composition is that it is moldable into more complex geometries to achieve better heat dissipation and electrical flow. Therefore, intricate part geometries are typically encountered when molding conductive polymer materials. The method of molding of the present invention solves the problem of molding complex geometries with material having filler that requires alignment to the thermal or electrical flow path or structural stress lines.<br>
With these intricate geometries, turbulence of the flow of the filler loaded matrix is common resulting in collisions of the filler material and non-uniform alignment. While parallel aligned of the high aspect ratio filler is obviously preferred, it cannot be attained. Further, the turbulence of flow and collisions with edges of the mold often breaks the high aspect ratio filler particularly when it has an aspect ratio larger than 20:1. Fig. 1 illustrates a realistic composition 2 with filler 8 being substcuitially aligned to adjacent filler 8 within polymer 4. Fig. 1 is what is encountered in the field, due to the inherent problems associated with molding material with filler therein. As will be discussed in detail below, the method of the present invention permits the molding of complex geometries with reduced breakage of the high aspect ratio filler 8 which would cause the desired reinforcement of the composition to degrade.<br>
Referring first to Figs. 2A and 2B, a molded article employing a prior art molding process is shown. For example. Fig. 2A shows a perspective view of a known thermally conductive article 10 is shown. In particular, thermally conductive article 10 is shown as a heat sink with a base 12 cued upstanding fins 14 connected thereto. This heat sink 10 is commonly affixed to a heat generating surface of a device (not shown), such as a semiconductor package, for the purposes of transferring heat away from the hot device. This heat dissipation is critical, particularly in electronic applications, to ensure that the device does not fail due to overheating.<br>
The bottom surface 20 of base 12 is placed into flush thermal communication  with  the  semiconductor  device  to  be  cooled-<br><br>
Typically, the semiconductor device to be cooled is positioned directly below the center of the base 12, generally referenced as 22, to achieve heat spreading 360 degrees about the device to be cooled. As shown in Fig. IB, a bottom view of molded article 10, a heat generating semiconductor device 22 is positioned in the general center area of base 12. As a result, heat will emanate outwardly from center area 22 where a heat generating semiconductor device is located.<br>
Figs. 2A and 2B also show the typical flow pattern of the mold material when it is introduced into a mold. The mold material is typically introduced at input gate 16 on one end of the article for flow from left to right and upward into fins 14. Venting 18 at the top portion of each fin, commonly at ejector pins (not shown), to release air within the mold cavity. A base polymer with a high aspect ratio filler to form a conductive polymer is not typical for forming heat sinks of complex geometries. Therefore, in the past/ flow direction of mold material, having no filler therein, is of little if no concern. Now, with the employment of high aspect ratio filler, gating locations and flow pattern within a mold cavity is of critical importance as addressed in the method of the present invention.<br>
Since the article of Figs. 2A and 2B is molded with a input gate location shown at 16, the flow pattern of the mold material and, thus, the orientation alignment of the filler material will be, essentially, parallel to the indicated arrows in a general left to right arrangement. However, horizontal arreuagement and alignment of filler material 8 will seriously degrade the thermal conductivity of article 10.<br>
Positioning a heat generating semiconductor device at central area 22, heat will naturally tend to radiate outwardly in all directions. As best seen in Fig, 2B, the thermal conductivity of article 10 when traveling to the left or to the right will be generally acceptable as the thermal flow path will be parallel to the ligament of filler material 8. However, when traveling up or down, the thermal flow path will be transverse to the alignment of the filler 8 within polymer 4 thus requiring the heat to traverse additional interfaces. As a result, thermal conductivity in these directions are severely degraded. Since thermal transfer is a bulk property, the overall thermal conductivity of article 10 is not optimal and fails to fully exploit the conductive properties of filler material 8 loaded within the polymer base matrix 4, Similar durations of the effect of the reinforcing filler would occur if an<br><br>
electrically conductive or structurally reinforcing filler were employed.<br>
Turning now to Figs. 3A, 3B, 4 and 5, the method of molding of the present invention is shown in detail. Referring now to Figs. 3A and 3B, an article 100 is provided with a base 112 and upstanding fins 114 connected thereto- By way of example, the present invention is described in connection with the molding of a thermally conductive article. The molding of electrically conductive and structurally reinforced articles are carried out employing the same method. A bottom surface 120 of base 112 is provided for flush thermal communication with a heat generating semiconductor device (not shown). Referring both to Figs, 3A and 3B, which shows a bottom view of article 100/ a semiconductor device is positioned substantially centrally below article 100 in the area designated as 122, In accordance with the present invention, an input mold gate is centrally provided at 16 for the introduction of mold material into the mold cavity (not shown) . Further, venting is provided at 118 where, for example, ejection pins (not shown) and the clearance there around are provided to simultaneous provide an air release and help urge the article 100 out of   mold after it has been formed.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the introduction of mold material at the centrally located gate 116 causes the mold contusive material to flow outwardly and up into fins 114 in a radiating pattern from gate 116. This flow radiation pattern causes high aspect ratio filler 8, loaded within the polymer base matrix 4, to be aligned therewith. As a result, filler 8 is oriented in an outwardly radiating pattern, as shown by the arrows in Fig. 3B, to closely match the actual thermal radiating path of the heat emanating from a heat generating semiconductor device located at central region 122. In accordance with the present invention, the close matching of the radiating pattern of filler 8 to the actual thermal flow path of heat from central area 122 takes fully exploits the composite polymer material, comely the highly conductive properties of the high aspect ratio filler 8 therein.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a method of molding a electrical ground plate in similar fashion to the heat sink shown in connection with Figs- 3A and 3B above. In Fig. 4, a substantially flat ground plate 200 is shown with a main body 212 with a bottom surface for contacting a electrical source, such as a neutral ground connection. In accordance with the present invention, plate 200 is molded by centrally  providing  an  input  gate  at  216  which has  been<br><br>
predetermined to be the center of the electrical source is located within center region 222. Venting is provided at the edges 212 of plate 200 to, in combination with input gate 216, urge flow of mold material outwardly in a radiating pattern to closely match the actual electrical flow path of electricity from the neutral ground connection. As stated above, outward radiating flow of mold composite material will naturally cause the high aspect ratio filler 8 to align with the electrical flow thus matching the filler alignment with the flow path.<br>
The method of molding a structurally reinforced article, in accordcuice with the present invention, is similar to molding a thermally conductive and electrically conductive reinforced articles above. The stress lines are determined to then determine a desired filler alignment path which is the desired positioning of the structurally reinforcing filler material is ascertained- The input gating is positioned to set the source of the filler material into the mold to correspond with the desired location to reduce the effect of stress on the article. Output gates or venting is also provided to further control the path and alignment of the filler within the   moldable article. For a structurally reinforced article, a suitable filler would be carbon fiber.<br>
Referring now to Figs. 5A and 5B, a mold assembly, such as an injection mold assembly, is employed in the method of the present invention is shown. Fig. 5A illustrates the bottom half 300 of a mold assembly which has a main body 306 with a cavity 302 therein. Gate 304 is centrally positioned on the bottom of cavity 302 for introducing mold material into the mold- Guide pins 308 are also provided for receipt within corresponding apertures 312 on upper mold half 310 shown in Fig. SB. The mold apparatus shown in Figs. 5A and 5B may be generally manufactured in accordance with known mold manufacturing techniques. However, as set forth in detail above, the positioning of gate 304 is specifically selected in accordance with the present invention to fully exploit the properties of the mold material having reinforcing filler therein.<br>
In connection with the present invention, a method of molding a reinforced article for transferring heat and/or electricity from a source is provided. A method of molding a reinforced high structural integrity article is also provided. First, the a mold assembly is selected that is capable of forming cin article of a desired configuration. The contact location of the article to the source surface is determined. In the mold assembly, an input gate is formed at a location that is in substantially at the center of<br><br>
the face of the article to be molded that will contact the heat or electrical source. The optimum heat or electrical flow path through the article is then determined as well as the termination locations of the flow path through the article to be molded. Venting is formed in the mold assembly at termination locations of the flow path. As part of the molding process, a polymer, loaded with conductive high aspect ratio filler, is introduced into the mold assembly via the preselected input gate. The polymer is positioned within the mold assembly with the conductive filler being substcmtially parallel and aligned with the predetermined heat flow path to fully optimize the conductivity of the polymer/filler composition. After formation, the molded and finished article is ejected from the mold assembly.<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
The mold apparatus shown in Figs. 5A and 5B was assembled to form a heat spreader as shown in Fig. 4. Composite mold material is introduced into the mold via an input gate located at the bottom center of the mold. The mold material used included a base polymer matrix with high aspect ratio filler carbon flakes that are 2/1000 to 4/1000 of an inch thick while being 40/1000 of an inch long with a minimum aspect ratio of approximately 10:1. After molding, the carbon flakes where aligned in the heat spreader finished article in an outwardly radiating pattern extending to the edges of the article. This radiating pattern closely matches the actual flow path of heat through the article to fully exploit the thermal conductivity of the material.<br>
As can be understood, the present invention can be adapted to form a wide array of configurations and shapes employing the method of the present invention. In that connection, the selection of the gating location and venting within the mold will effectively align the filler as desired within the article. The method of the present invention achieves higher thermal and electrical conductivities and higher strength articles than that capable of from prior methods, even employing the same polymers and fillers. The base materials and fillers may be selected to optimize the desired thermal, electrical and structural properties of the finished article.<br>
