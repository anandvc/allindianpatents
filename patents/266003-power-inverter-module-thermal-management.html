				<td>POWER INVERTER MODULE THERMAL MANAGEMENT<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] This disclosure relates generally to electric motors, and more<br>
particularly relates to thermal management of a Power Inverter Module (PIM)<br>
for an electrical motor.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] In recent years, advances in technology, as well as ever evolving<br>
tastes in style, have led to substantial changes in the design of automobiles.<br>
One of the changes involves the complexity, as well as the power usage, of the<br>
various electrical systems within automobiles, particularly alternative fuel<br>
vehicles, such as hybrid, electric, and fuel cell vehicles.<br>
[0003] The power and/or torque density required for motors used in such<br>
vehicles is extremely high. The amount of power or torque that can be<br>
generated by a particular motor is limited in large part by the winding, or coil,<br>
temperature within the motor during operation. If the motor is permitted to<br>
operate such that the winding temperature becomes too high, sensitive<br>
electrical components, such as semiconductor devices of the PIM, may be<br>
damaged.<br>
[0004] One commonly used method of limiting PIM temperature is to<br>
calculate I2T (current to temperature) of output or DC current and to limit the<br>
duration of the peak current, which is fixed proportional to the nominal current<br>
of the specification. However, this approach does not consider the heating<br>
mechanism inside the PIM, and works in a completely open-loop manner.<br>
[0005] Accordingly, it is desirable to provide a system and method for<br>
limiting the operating temperature of an electric motor that allows the<br>
operational temperature to be continuously controlled at various stages of<br><br>
operation. In addition, it is desirable to provide a system and method that<br>
facilitates continuous operation of the motor while limiting the operating<br>
temperature. Furthermore, other desirable features and characteristics of the<br>
present invention will become apparent from the subsequent detailed<br>
description and the appended claims, taken in conjunction with the<br>
accompanying drawings and the foregoing technical field and background.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006] According to various exemplary embodiments, a method is<br>
provided for limiting an operational temperature of a motor. The method<br>
includes generating a maximum allowable current I*S(max) for a motor based on<br>
a temperature difference between a temperature reference T* of a power<br>
inverter module and a semiconductor device temperature T of the power<br>
inverter module. The method further includes generating a maximum<br>
allowable torque T*e(max) based on the maximum allowable current I*S(max) and a<br>
maximum allowable flux Ïˆ*S(max), and using the maximum allowable torque<br>
T*e(max) to limit the torque command T*e in order to suppress the semiconductor<br>
device temperature T to below the temperature reference T*.<br>
[0007] According to other exemplary embodiments, a controller operable<br>
to limit a temperature of a power inverter module in an automotive system is<br>
provided. The controller includes a temperature error circuit operable to<br>
provide a difference between a temperature reference for the power inverter<br>
module and a temperature of the power inverter module at an output of the<br>
temperature error circuit, and a Proportional Integrator (PI) controller circuit<br>
coupled to the output of the temperature error circuit, the PI controller circuit<br>
operable to provide a current reference T*e(max) based at least in part upon the<br>
difference.<br>
[0008] According to various other exemplary embodiments, an automotive<br>
system is provided. The automotive system suitably includes a motor and a<br><br>
power inverter module coupled to the motor. The automotive system further<br>
includes a controller coupled to the motor and torque limiter coupled to the<br>
controller. The controller is operable to generate a maximum allowable<br>
current T*e(max) for the motor based on a difference between a temperature limit<br>
T* for the power inverter module and a semiconductor device temperature<br>
T of the power inverter module. The torque limiter is operable to limit a<br>
torque command for the motor based upon the maximum allowable current<br>
T*e(max).<br>

DESCRIPTION OF AN EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT<br>
[0021] The following detailed description is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and is not intended to limit the invention or the application and uses of the<br>
invention. Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any expressed or<br>
implied theory presented in the preceding technical field, background, brief<br>
summary or the following detailed description.<br>
[0022] The following description refers to elements or features being<br>
"connected" or "coupled" together. As used herein, unless expressly stated<br>
otherwise, "connected" means that one element/feature is directly joined to (or<br>
directly communicates with) another element/feature, and not necessarily<br>
mechanically. Likewise, unless expressly stated otherwise, "coupled" means<br>
that one element/feature is directly or indirectly joined to (or directly or<br>
indirectly communicates with) another element/feature, and not necessarily<br>
mechanically. However, it should be understood that although two elements<br>
may be described below, in one embodiment, as being "connected," in<br>
alternative embodiments similar elements may be "coupled," and vice versa.<br>
Thus, although the schematic diagrams shown herein depict example<br>
arrangements of elements, additional intervening elements, devices, features,<br>
or components may be present in an actual embodiment. It should also be<br>
understood that FIGS. 1-11 are merely illustrative and may not be drawn to<br>
scale.<br>
[0023] FIG. 1 to FIG. 11 illustrate a method and/or system for limiting the<br>
operating temperature of an electric motor. According to one aspect, a<br><br>
maximum allowable current T*e(max) of the motor is generated based on the<br>
temperature difference between the junction temperature reference (or limit)<br>
T* and the real (either measured or estimated) junction temperature T .<br>
According to another aspect, the maximum allowable current T*e(max) of the<br>
motor is generated based on the temperature difference between the substrate<br>
temperature reference (or limit) T* and the real (either measured or estimated)<br>
substrate temperature T*e(max) The maximum allowable current T*e(max) of the<br>
motor is then converted to a torque limit that is used to limit the torque<br>
command of the motor.<br>
[0024] FIG. 1 illustrates a vehicle 10, or "automobile", according to one<br>
embodiment. The automobile 10 includes a chassis 12, a body 14, four wheels<br>
16, and an electronic control system 18. The body 14 is arranged on the<br>
chassis 12 and substantially encloses the other components of the automobile<br>
10. The body 14 and the chassis 12 may jointly form a frame. The wheels 16<br>
are each rotationally coupled to the chassis 12 near a respective corner of the<br>
body 14.<br>
[0025] The automobile 10 may be any one of a number of different types<br>
of automobiles, such as, for example, a sedan, a wagon, a truck, or a sport<br>
utility vehicle (SUV), and may be two-wheel drive (2WD) (i.e., rear-wheel<br>
drive or front-wheel drive), four-wheel drive (4WD) or all-wheel drive<br>
(AWD). The vehicle 10 may also incorporate any one of, or combination of, a<br>
number of different types of engines, such as, for example, a gasoline or diesel<br>
fueled combustion engine, a "flex fuel vehicle" (FFV) engine (i.e., using a<br>
mixture of gasoline and alcohol), a gaseous compound (e.g., hydrogen and/or<br>
natural gas) fueled engine, a combustion/electric motor hybrid engine, and an<br>
electric motor.<br>
[0026] In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1, the automobile<br>
10 is a hybrid vehicle, and further includes an actuator assembly 20, a battery<br>
22, a PIM assembly 24, and a radiator 26. The actuator assembly 20 includes<br><br>
a combustion engine 28 and an electric motor/generator (or motor) 30. As will<br>
be appreciated by one skilled in the art, the electric motor 30 includes a<br>
transmission therein, and although not illustrated also includes a stator<br>
assembly (including a plurality of conductive coils), a rotor assembly<br>
(including a ferromagnetic core), a cooling fluid (i.e., coolant), and at least one<br>
temperature sensor therein. The combustion engine 28 and the electric motor<br>
30 are integrated such that both are mechanically coupled to at least some of<br>
the wheels 16 through one or more drive shafts 32. The radiator 26 is<br>
connected to the frame at an outer portion thereof and although not illustrated<br>
in detail, includes multiple cooling channels therethough that contain a cooling<br>
fluid (i.e., coolant) such as water and/or ethylene glycol (i.e., "antifreeze) and<br>
is coupled to the engine 28 and the PIM assembly 24. In one embodiment, the<br>
PIM assembly 24 receives and shares coolant with the electric motor 30. The<br>
radiator 26 may be similarly connected to the PIM assembly 24 and/or the<br>
electric motor 30.<br>
[0027] The electronic control system 18 is in operable communication<br>
with the actuator assembly 20 (including the temperature sensors therein), the<br>
battery 22, and the PIM assembly 24. Although not shown in detail, the<br>
electronic control system 18 includes various sensors and automotive control<br>
modules, or electronic control units (ECUs), such as an inverter control<br>
module and a vehicle controller, and at least one processor and/or a memory<br>
which includes instructions stored thereon (or in another computer-readable<br>
medium) for carrying out the processes and methods as described below.<br>
[0028] During operation, still referring to FIG. 1, the vehicle 10 is<br>
operated by providing power to the wheels 16 with the combustion engine 28<br>
and the electric motor 30 in an alternating manner and/or with the combustion<br>
engine 28 and the electric motor 30 simultaneously. In order to power the<br>
electric motor 30, direct current (DC) power is provided from the battery 22 to<br>
the PIM assembly 24, which converts the DC power into alternating current<br>
(AC) power, before the power is sent to the electric motor 30.<br><br>
[0029] FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary PIM 200<br>
according to an embodiment. The PIM 200 suitably includes a gate drive unit<br>
210 and six pairs of parallel-connected insulated bipolar transistors (IGBT)<br>
and diodes 201-206, where pair 201 includes IGBT Ql and diode Dl, pair 202<br>
include IGBT Q2 and diode D2, pair 203 includes IGBT Q3 and diode D3,<br>
etc. Each IGBT and diode can represent a single silicon chip or the parallel<br>
connection of multiple chips.<br>
[0030] The gates of the IGBTs Q1-Q6 are coupled to the gate drive unit<br>
210, which controls the operation of the IGBTs. Each of the six IGBT-diode<br>
pairs 201-206 is serially connected with another one of the six pairs across a<br>
positive supply voltage and a negative supply voltage provided by the battery<br>
22, which constitutes the DC input voltage Vdc for the PIM 200. Each IGBT-<br>
diode pair 201-206 becomes a switch for the motor control, and the nodes 220,<br>
230,240 between the serially-connected IGBT-diode pairs together provide a<br>
three-phase AC output voltage. The PIM 200 also includes a capacitor 215<br>
connected across the DC input voltage VDC.<br>
[0031] Other embodiments may utilize other PIM designs. For example,<br>
in some applications Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field Effect Transistors<br>
(MOSFETs) may be used in place of the IGBT-diode pairs 201-206.<br>
[0032] FIG. 3 is a schematic diagram further illustrating the construction<br>
of the PIM 200 of FIG. 2 according to an embodiment. The silicon chip or<br>
silicon chips of the PIM 200 may be attached to a circuit board like the direct<br>
copper bonded substrate illustrated in FIG. 3. Alternatively, the silicon chip or<br>
silicon chips may be attached to a lead frame with insulation material or to an<br>
insulated metal substrate having a similar configuration.<br>
[0033] FIG. 3 illustrates that the IGBT Ql and diode Dl are bonded with<br>
solder layer 350 to a copper layer 340. An insulation layer 330 is disposed<br>
between the copper layer 340 and another copper layer 320, which is<br>
thermally coupled to a heatsink 300 by a thermal contact 310.<br>
[0034] The current or power rating of the PIM 200 is limited by the<br>
maximum temperature of the silicon junction during operation, which is a<br><br>
function of the power dissipation and the thermal impedance where they are<br>
attached. Each IGBT-diode pair 201-206 experiences a conduction loss when<br>
the pair is turned on and a switching loss during the transition between the on<br>
and off states. These losses that are generated in the silicon chips are<br>
transferred through the layers shown in FIG. 3. Each layer 300-350 illustrated<br>
in FIG. ,3 has a finite thermal impedance which causes a temperature<br>
difference between the layers when any power dissipation occurs.<br>
[0035] Since each switch of FIG. 2 should be electrically isolated from the<br>
outside world, the insulation layer 330 represents a significant portion of<br>
thermal impedance of the PIM 200. The heat sink 300 in FIG. 3 interfaces the<br>
PIM with the ambient coolant, which may be air, water, oil, etc., and<br>
represents another large portion of the thermal impedance in the thermal<br>
system. The copper layers 320, 340 and solder layer 350, as well as the silicon<br>
of the IGBTs Q1-Q6 and diodes D1-D6 have much less thermal impedance<br>
than the insulation layer 330. For simplicity, the chip temperature may be<br>
considered equivalent to the junction temperature T, the substrate<br>
temperature may be considered equivalent to the temperature at the bottom<br>
side of the heat sink 300. The substrate may be considered to be the<br>
combination of the solder layer 350, the copper layer 340, the insulation layer<br>
330, and the copper layer 320, which may be modeled as a single piece of<br>
thermal impedance. Similarly, the thermal contact 310, which may be thermal<br>
grease or a thermal pad with relatively low thermal impedance, may be<br>
regarded as being part of the heatsink 300.<br>
[0036] FIG. 4 is a block diagram illustrating the equivalent thermal model<br>
of the PIM 200 of FIGS. 2 and 3. It is assumed that the substrate temperature<br>
is uniform, and there is no direct thermal interaction between the switches<br>
201-206. If there are multiple chips used to implement the switches 201-206,<br>
then it can be considered a lumped element assuming the even distribution of<br>
power dissipation. For instance, the thermal impedance of IGBT Ql in FIG. 2<br>
may be defined by the relationship between the power dissipation and the<br>
temperature difference as equation (1).<br><br><br><br>
[0037]       In equation (1), the subscript "j" stands for the junction, the<br>
subscript "s" stands for the substrate, Pd(Q1) represents the power dissipation of<br>
Ql, Pd(Q1) is the thermal impedance, and * is the convolution operator. After<br>
Laplace transformation of equation (1), the thermal impedance Pd(Q1) is typically<br>
represented as a first-order lag system as shown in equation (2).<br><br>
[0038] In equation (2), Pd(Q1) is the thermal time constant, s is the Laplace<br>
operator, and Pd(Q1) is the thermal resistance, or the thermal impedance at the<br>
steady state. The thermal impedance between the substrate and the ambient<br>
material is similarly defined in equation (3).<br><br>
[0039]      In equation (3), the subscript "c" refers to the coolant and Pd is the<br>
total power dissipation delivered to the heatsink. Assuming that all IGBT-<br>
diode pairs 201-206 are attached to the same heatsink, the junction<br>
temperature of Ql may then be calculated with equation (4), which is obtained<br>
from equations (l)-(3).<br><br>
[0040]      In equation (4), ATSC = Ts - Tc, where Tc is the ambient temperature<br>
of the system, and which in automotive applications is the coolant<br>
temperature. From equation (4), if the junction temperature Pd(Q1) is<br>
measurable, it is possible to control the junction temperature by adjusting its<br>
self-dissipation Pd(Q1) as well as the total power dissipation Pd-<br>
[0041]       In most practical cases, it is difficult to measure the junction<br>
temperature directly unless there is a built-in temperature sensor on the silicon<br>
chip. However, in automotive applications the ambient temperature Tc is<br>
measured for other purposes, and if there is enough knowledge of the power<br>
dissipation of the thermal system, it may be used to estimate the junction<br>
temperature in equation (4). At extremely low speeds of the motor, the power<br>
dissipations from each switch may not be balanced. In this case, it would be<br><br>
appropriate to build a thermal model of each switch to generate its<br>
temperature, and then take the maximum value to limit the maximum junction<br>
temperature inside the module. Hereafter, it is assumed that the power<br>
dissipation of each switch in FIG. 2 is balanced, and that the IGBT<br>
temperature is controlled. As was shown by D.W. Chung et al. ("Minimum-<br>
loss strategy for three-phase PWM rectifier," IEEE Trans. Ind. Electronics.,<br>
vol. 46, no. 3, June 1999, pp. 517-526), the power dissipation of each chip<br>
may be calculated from equations (5) - (12), where it is assumed that the PIM<br>
is operating in a balanced manner, with power dissipation evenly generated<br>
from each chip.<br><br>
[0042] Equations (5) and (6) calculate the conduction losses of the IGBT<br>
and the diode, respectively, and the effect of the modulation method is<br>
ignored. In equations (5) and (6), Is is the peak amplitude of the sinusoidal<br>
motor current. In equation (5), VT and RT are parameters of the lst-order<br>
model of IGBT voltage drop as a function of the device current (phase current<br>
when it is conducting), and MI is the modulation index normalized by half of<br>
the DC supply voltage, VDc- Similarly, in equation (6), VD and RD are<br>
parameters of the lst-order model of diode voltage drop as a function of the<br><br>
device current (phase current when it is conducting), and MI is the modulation<br>
index normalized by Pd(Q1).<br>
[0043] Equations (7) and (8) calculate the switching losses of the IGBT<br>
and the diode, respectively. In equations (7) and (8), Is is the peak amplitude<br>
of the sinusoidal motor current, ESW(QJ and ESw(D) is the sum of energy<br>
dissipated during on and off transitions by the IGBT and the diode,<br>
respectively, at given phase current Ispec and given DC bus voltage Vspec. It is<br>
assumed that continuous, Single Value Pulse Width Modulation (SVPWM) is<br>
used with the switching frequency fsw- It can be seen from equations (7) and<br>
(8) that the switching losses are proportional to the phase current Is and the<br>
DC supply voltage VDC-<br>
[0044] In cases where discontinuous PWM is used, the switching loss<br>
calculated in equations (7) and (8) is scaled according to equation (9), where<br>
0.5 
modulation method. The total power dissipated by each IGBT and diode are<br>
given by equations (10) and (11), respectively, while the total power<br>
dissipated by the PIM 200 is six times the sum of equations (10) and (11), as<br>
shown in equation (12). As was noted above, the power dissipation Pd(Q1) of<br>
equation (10) and the power dissipation Pd(D) of equation (11) affect the<br>
temperature difference between the silicon junction and the substrate, while<br>
the total power dissipation Pd of equation (12) affects the temperature<br>
difference between the substrate and the ambient, as noted in equations (1) -<br>
(4).<br>
[0045] In order to control the temperature of the IGBT or the diode at a<br>
given operating condition for the DC bus voltage VDc and operating speed, the<br>
operating current Is may be adjusted. It may also be possible to adjust the<br>
switching frequency to achieve the same goal, but it will be restricted in some<br>
operating conditions, especially at high speed operation, because it can<br>
degrade the control resolution.<br>
[0046] FIG. 5 is a block diagram modeling a plant 500 that utilizes the<br>
PIM of FIG. 2. As illustrated in FIG. 5, the phase current Is is input to the<br><br>
PIM block 510, as well as to the IGBT block 520 and the Diode block 530.<br>
The DC supply voltage VDC and the modulation index MI are operating<br>
conditions of the PIM block 510, and are parameters used in equations (5) -<br>
(8). Based upon these inputs to the IGBT block 520 and the Diode block 530,<br>
the power dissipations Pd(Q1) and Pd(D) may be obtained as indicated in equations<br>
(10) and (11). Summing block 540 and gain block 550, which has a gain<br>
factor of 6, together implement equation (12) to obtain the total power<br>
dissipated Pd-<br>
[0047] In block 560, the thermal impedance between the junction and the<br>
substrate Pd(Q1) is multiplied by the power dissipated by the IGBT (P<kq to></kq>
calculate the temperature difference between the junction and the substrate<br>
Pd(Q1), as defined in equation (2). Similarly, in block 570, the thermal<br>
impedance between the substrate and the coolant (Tsc) is multiplied with the<br>
total power dissipated (Pd) to calculate the temperature difference between the<br>
substrate and the ambient (ATSC), as defined in equation (3). Finally, in<br>
summing block 580, the temperature difference between the IGBT junction<br>
and the substrate Pd(Q1), the temperature difference between the substrate<br>
and the coolant (ATSC), and the coolant temperature Tc are added to obtain the<br>
IGBT junction temperature (TKQ)) as defined in equation (4).<br>
[0048] FIG. 6 is a simplified block diagram modeling a system 600 in<br>
accordance with an embodiment of the invention. In FIG. 6, the system 600<br>
includes a difference block 610 and a controller C(s) 620. The system 600<br>
additionally includes the plant P(s) 500 of FIG. 5, which is simplified in FIG.<br>
6 and represented as a single block. The rest of the inputs to the plant 500 in<br>
FIG. 5 are treated as parameters, and are not shown in FIG. 6. As illustrated in<br>
FIG, 6, the motor current Is is the input to the plant 500, and the IGBT<br>
junction temperature Tj is the output of the plant. The controller 620 is<br>
operable to adjust the amount of phase current Is based on the temperature<br>
difference between the IGBT junction temperature reference (or limit) T* and<br><br>
the real IGBT junction temperature T, which is calculated by the difference<br>
block 610.<br>
[0049] Since the thermal time constant of the substrate Pd(Q1) in equation<br>
(2) is typically smaller than one second, it is not practical to use this time<br>
constant to boost up the inverter rating. Moreover, most of the temperature<br>
sensors have slower dynamics than the time constant Pd(Q1), SO it can be assumed<br>
that that there is no dynamics of substrate, and only the substrate temperature<br>
changes slowly according to the time constant of the heat sink. After<br>
removing the effect of the substrate time constant, the system 600 of FIG. 6<br>
can be modified as shown in FIG. 7.<br>
[0050] FIG. 7 is a block diagram modeling a system 700 in accordance<br>
with an embodiment of the invention. Like system 600, the system 700<br>
includes the plant P(s) 500 of FIG. 5. System 700 additionally includes<br>
controller C(s) 730 and difference junctions 710, 720, and 740. According to<br>
this embodiment, the controller 730 is operable to adjust the amount of phase<br>
current Is based on the temperature difference, supplied by the difference<br>
junction 720, between the substrate temperature reference (or limit) T* and the<br>
measured substrate temperature Ts.<br>
[0051] The substrate temperature reference T* can be calculated by<br>
subtracting, at difference junction 710, the estimated temperature difference<br>
Pd(Q1) from the IGBT junction temperature reference TJ. By neglecting the<br>
effect of the thermal time constant (TJSQ) of equation (2), the estimated<br>
temperature difference Pd(Q1) may be calculated as shown in equation (13).<br><br>
[0052] The feedback signal, or substrate temperature Ts, can be measured<br>
from the temperature sensor, which is typically attached to the substrate of the<br>
power module for temperature protection. The plant P(s) 500 and the<br>
difference junction 740 may be considered a new plant p(s) 750 with the phase<br>
current Is as the input and substrate temperature Ts as the output.<br><br>
[0053] FIG. 8 is a block diagram modeling a system 800 in accordance<br>
with an embodiment of the invention. Like system 600, the system 800<br>
includes the plant P(s) 500 of FIG. 5. System 800 also includes controller C(s)<br>
830, difference junctions 810 and 820, and calculation block 840. According<br>
to this embodiment, the controller 830 is operable to adjust the amount of<br>
phase current Is based on the temperature difference, supplied by the<br>
difference junction 820, between the substrate temperature reference (or limit)<br>
T* and the estimated substrate temperature Ts. System 800 represents quasi-<br>
open-loop control of the junction temperature Tj.<br>
[0054] The estimated substrate temperature Ts may be used in cases where,<br>
unlike the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 7, the measured substrate<br>
temperature Ts is not available from a temperature sensor that is attached to<br>
the substrate. The calculation block 840 is operable to obtain an estimated<br>
substrate temperature Ts from equations (2) - (12) and the phase current Is.<br>
The calculation block 840 is further operable to obtain the estimated<br>
temperature difference Pd(Q1) using equation (13). Difference junction 810<br>
has the same function as difference junction 710 in FIG. 7, but difference<br>
junction 820 uses the estimated substrate temperature Ts rather than the<br>
measured substrate temperature Ts that is used by difference junction 720.<br>
[0055] When it comes to the design of controllers 730 and 830 that control<br>
the substrate temperature, a Proportional Integration (PI) controller may be<br>
used, with a gain that is derived as explained below. In order to have a first<br>
order response with the finite bandwidth Pd(Q1) the open-loop gain of the system<br>
700 of FIG. 7 should become a first order integrator as shown in equation (14),<br>
and the controller C(s) should satisfy the condition of equation (15), where kp<br>
and ki are the gains of the PI controller.<br><br><br><br>
[0056] The plant p(s) is not actually a linear time-invariant system, but a<br>
non-linear time-varying system, and it can be calculated from equations (3)<br>
and (5) - (12). Assuming that all parameters do not change with small<br>
changes in the motor current Is, it is possible to approach this problem using<br>
small signal analysis, to arrive at equation (16).<br><br>
[0057] However, parameters such as MI and  in equations (5) and (6) are<br>
also functions of the phase current is by the motor operation, thus equation<br>
(16) can be a solution of an iterative equation. By accepting the result of<br>
equation (16), then the gains kp and k, of the PI controller C(s) in equation<br>
(15) are derived as equations (17) and (18).<br><br><br><br>
[0058] In equation (16), Cqi, CQ2, CDi, and CD2 are coefficient factors of<br>
IGBT and diode losses in equations (10) and (11), which can be expressed as<br>
equations (19) and (20).<br><br>
[0059] Thus far, the controller C(s) design has been focused on the IGBT<br>
junction temperature control, but fc&gt;T most practical applications the P1M<br>
temperature should be restricted below the safety limit rather than controlling<br>
it to be the same as the reference. In such cases, the output of the controller<br>
C(s) will determine the maximum allowable current limit for the PIM to be<br>
operated within the allowable temperature limit TÂ°.<br><br>
[0060] Moreover, since the phase current Is is not directly proportional to<br>
the torque depending on the operating speed and the DC bus voltage, the<br>
torque command, rather than the phase current Is, should be the input to the<br>
motor control algorithm. Therefore, the temperature-limiting controller C(s)<br>
should be accommodated for motor control purposes.<br>
[0061] For example, in the case of permanent magnet AC motors, the<br>
maximum torque at a specific speed is limited by the relation between the DC<br>
bus voltage and the amplitude of the Back ElectroMotive Force (BEMF). If<br>
BEMF exceeds a certain portion of the DC bus voltage VDC, then the BEMF<br>
should be reduced by increasing the demagnetizing current of the motor or by<br>
decreasing the motor torque command. This gives the nonlinear relation<br>
between the motor torque and current, which can be solved by the two-<br>
dimensional table shown in FIG. 9.<br>
[0062] FIG. 9 is a graph illustrating the maximum available torque of an<br>
example motor as a function of flux and current. The graph of FIG. 9 requires<br>
two inputs; one is the allowable current limit I*Pd(Q1) in units of Amperes,<br>
which may be the output of the temperature-limiting controller C(s). The<br>
other input is the maximum allowable flux Pd(Q1), in units of Volt seconds,<br>
that is defined by the ratio between the DC bus voltage VDC and the operating<br>
speed. The output of FIG. 9 is the maximum allowable torque T*(mm)<br>
corresponding to the current limit at the operating condition. Graphs such as<br>
FIG. 9 are easily obtainable for a particular motor by measuring the capability<br>
of the drive system, or it can be taken by the characterization of the motor for<br>
the field weakening operation.<br>
[0063] When applying the output Is of controllers 730, 830 for the PIM<br>
temperature limiting purpose, due to stability issues, the control bandwidth coc<br>
should not be set higher than the feedback bandwidth of the temperature<br>
sensor that is used to measure the substrate temperature Ts- Thus, coc is<br>
selected between the feedback bandwidth and the cutoff frequency l/xSc from<br>
equation (3).<br><br>
[0064] As an example, the time constant of a typical thermistor is in the<br>
range of about 3 to 5 seconds. If the thermistor is used to measure the<br>
substrate temperature Ts, then the bandwidth of this controller cannot be<br>
higher than 0.2 to 0.3 rad/s, which is quite slow compared with any other<br>
controllers in the motor drive system. Therefore, if the output of this<br>
controller were used to limit the motor current or the torque command for<br>
over-temperature protection, the final torque achieved would follow the<br>
dynamics of the temperature controller, which should not be used for<br>
automotive applications that should have fast torque control on the order of a<br>
few milliseconds to a hundred milliseconds of response time.<br>
[0065] In order to speed up the control behavior, a feedforward current<br>
term Is{ff) that provides an estimate of the allowable current limit at the<br>
steady state should be used. The feedforward current IS(ff) can be calculated<br>
by solving the steady-state solution of equations (4), (12), (19), and (20). In<br>
the steady state, equation (4) can be rewritten as equation (21).<br><br>
[0066] Here, Pi and 02 are functions of operating condition as mentioned<br>
above. When the temperature reference Tj = Tm is greater than the coolant<br>
temperature Tc, a unique solution to equation (21) exists as equation (22).<br><br>
[0067] When adopting the feedforward current term IS(ff), the controllers<br>
730, 830 should reduce the feedforward current to compensate for the<br>
modeling error when the temperature error is negative, and to boost up the<br>
inverter power when the temperature error is positive. The positive limit of<br>
the integrator in the PI controller should be set to zero in order not to<br><br>
accumulate the temperature error when the feedback temperature is lower than<br>
the temperature reference. In other words, when the error is positive with the<br>
initial integrator value of zero, the amount of current boost according to this<br>
algorithm is determined by the controller gain kp and the temperature error as<br>
shown in equation (23).<br><br>
[0068] FIG. 10 is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary PIM<br>
temperature limiting controller 1000 in accordance with an embodiment of the<br>
invention. The controller 1000 suitably includes a temperature error block<br>
1010, a PI controller block 1020, a feedforward block 1030, a limiting block<br>
1040, a discrepancy collection block 1050, a maximum torque block 1060, and<br>
an operating condition block 1070.<br>
[0069] The temperature error block 1010 includes difference junctions<br>
1011 and 1013. Difference junction 1011 subtracts the estimated temperature<br>
difference ATjs between the junction and the substrate from the temperature<br>
reference T* to obtain the substrate temperature reference T*. Difference<br>
junction 1013 subtracts the estimated substrate temperature Ts from the<br>
substrate temperature reference T* to obtain the substrate temperature error<br>
AT, which is provided as input to the PI controller block 1020. The estimated<br>
substrate temperature Ts and the estimated junction temperature 7} maybe<br>
obtained based on equations (5) - (12).<br>
[0070] Using the estimated substrate temperature Ts and the estimated<br>
junction temperature  as illustrated in FIG. 10 represents quasi-open-loop<br>
control. In alternative embodiments, the measured substrate temperature <br>
and the measured junction temperature  may be used.<br><br>
[0071] The PI controller block 1020 includes difference junction 1021,<br>
gain blocks 1023 and 1029, integrator block 1025, and summing junction<br>
1027, which implement the PI controller that was described above. The<br>
current reference IS(Jb) for the current boost is the output of the PI controller<br>
block 1020.<br>
[0072] The feedforward block 1030 calculates the feedforward current<br>
term IS{ff) and adds it to the current reference IS(jb) at summing junction 1031<br>
to obtain the initial maximum allowable currentPd(Q1)The limiting block<br>
1040 limits the initial maximum allowable current Is*(max) of the feedforward<br>
block 1030 based on the maximum or minimum required for the system<br>
operation to obtain the maximum allowable current Is*(max)  As was explained<br>
above, the maximum allowable current Is*(max) is one of the inputs to the<br>
maximum torque block 1060.<br>
[0073] The discrepancy collection block 1050 collects the difference<br>
between the feedforward block 1030 and the limiting block 1040 at difference<br>
junction 1053, then reduces it by a factor of l/kp at gain block 1051. The<br>
reduced difference is then fed back to the PI controller block 1020 at<br>
difference junction 1021 in order to avoid the wind-up phenomena.<br>
[0074] The operating condition block 1070 obtains the ratio of the DC bus<br>
voltage Vpc and the operating speed NR at block 1071, then multiplies the<br>
ratio by a factor of K at gain block 1073 to obtain the maximum allowable<br>
flux Is*(max)  As was explained above, the maximum allowable flux Is*(max) is<br>
the other input to the maximum torque block 1060. Based on the maximum<br>
allowable current Is*(max) and the maximum allowable flux Is*(max), the<br>
maximum torque block 1060 generates the maximum allowable torque Is*(max).<br>
The maximum allowable torque T*(Bax) may then be sent to the motor control<br>
algorithm to limit the torque command to suppress the IGBT junction<br>
temperature to be below the temperature reference or limit.<br><br>
[0075] FIG. 11 is a block diagram illustrating an example of limiting the<br>
torque command based on the output of FIG. 10 in accordance with an<br>
example embodiment. In FIG. 11, the maximum torque block 1060 and the<br>
operating condition block 1070 are shown as in FIG. 10. The torque limiting<br>
block 1080 uses the maximum allowable torque T*{mw) to limit the initial<br>
torque command 77*and produce the torque command T*. The field<br>
weakening algorithm 1090 is then used to generate a current command from<br>
the limited torque at a particular speed (Nr) and the DC bus voltage VDC- In<br>
the illustrated embodiment, the current command includes two commands, I'd<br>
and /*, to control current within an inverter such as the PIM 200 of FIG. 2.<br>

variations exist. It should also be appreciated that the example embodiment or<br>
