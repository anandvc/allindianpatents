				<td>SPECIFICATION<br>
NOVEL ASPARTYL DIPEPTIDE ESTER DERIVA^l^lES   AND SWEETENERS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to novel aspartyl dipeptide ester derivatives, and sweeteners and products such as foods having a sweetness, which contain the same as an active ingredient.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In recent years, as eating habits have been improved to a high level, fatness caused by excessive intake of sugar and diseases accompanied by fatness have been at issue. Accordingly, the development of a low-calory sweetener that replaces sugar has been in demand. As a sweetener that has been widely used at present, there is aspartame which is excellent in a safety and taste properties. However, this is somewhat problematic in the stability. In WO 94/11391, it is stated that derivatives in which an alkyl group is introduced in an amino group of aspartic acid constituting aspartame markedly improves sweetening potency and the stability is slightly improved.  It is reported that the best compound described in this document is N- [N- (3,3-dimethylbutyl)-L-a<br><br>
-aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester having a 3,3-dimethylbutyl group as an alkyl group and the sweetening potency thereof is 10,000 times that of sugar.  Aspartame derivatives having introduced therein 20 types of substituents other than the 3,3-dimethylbutyl group are indicated therein, and the sweetening potency thereof is reported to be less than 2,500  times  that of sugar.   Derivatives having a 3-(substituted phenyl)propyl group as an alkyl group are also shown.  However, it is reported that the sweetening potency of N-[N-(3-phenylpropyl)-L-a-aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester is 1,500 times that of sugar and that of N-[N-[3-(3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl)propyl]-L-a-aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester is 2,500 times that of sugar. Thus, these are far less than that (10,000 times) of N-[N-(3,3-dimethylbutyl)-L-a-aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester.       Furthermore,    N-[N-(3,3-dimethylbutyl)-L-a-aspartyl] -L- tyrosine 1-methyl ester is stated therein as an example of the derivatives in which L-phenylalanine methyl ester is replaced by the other amino acid ester, and it is reported that its sweetening potency is 4,000 times that of sugar.<br>
Under these circumstances, development of a low-calory sweetener having fine sweetening potency is in demand.<br><br>
PROBLEM AND OBJECT OF THE INVENTION	<br>
It is a problem to be solved by the present invention to provide novel aspartyl dipeptide ester derivatives which are excellent in the safety and which have sweetening potency equal to or higher than that of the N-[N-(3,3-dimethylbutyl)-L-Î±  -aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester, a low-calory sweetener containing the same as an active ingredient and the like.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
In order to solve the problem, the present inventors have synthesized several aspartame derivatives in which various 3 - (substituted phenyl)propyl group are introduced onto a nitrogen atom of aspartic acid constituting the aspartame derivatives, wherein a moiety of L-Phenylalanine methyl ester in the aspartame is replaced by another amino acid ester, through reductive alkylation by use of cinnamaldehydes having various substituent and easily avaialble, or 3-phenylpropionaldehyde having various substituent that can easily derived therefrom as precursor aldehyde, and have examined  the  sweetening  potency of  them.   They have consequently found that with respect to the sweetening potency, the novel compounds that they have found are by far higher than not only N-[N-(3,3-dimethylbutyl)-L-a-aspartyl]-L-tyrosine 1-methyl ester which is reported to have the sweetening potency<br><br>
of 4,000 times that of sugar in WO 94/11391 but also N-[N-(3,3-dimethylbutyl) -L-a-aspartyl] -L-phenylalanine l-methyl ester which is reported therein to have the potency of 10,000 times that of sugar and that especially the compounds represented by the following formula (1) are excellent as<br>
sweeteners. These findings have led to the completion of the<br>
present invention.<br>

These are included in the derivatives of the present invention as described above.<br>
The aspartyl dipeptide ester derivatives of the present invention can easily be formed by reductively alkylating aspartame derivatives, wherein a moiety of L-phenylalanine methyl ester in the aspartame is replaced by another amino acid ester, with cinnamaldehydes having various substituents and a reducing agent (for example, hydrogen/palladium carbon<br><br>
catalyst). Alternatively, the derivatives can be formed by subjecting aspartame derivatives (for example, P-0-benzyl-a-L-aspartyl-L-amino acid methyl ester) having a protective group in a carboxylic acid in the B-position which derivatives can be obtained by the usual peptide synthesis method (Izumiya et al., Basis of Peptide Synthesis and Experiments Thereof, Maruzen, published January 20, 1985) to reductive alkylation with cinnamaldehydes having various substituents and a reducing agent (for example, NaB(0Ac)3H) (A. F. Abdel-Magid et al.. Tetrahedron Letters, 11, 5595 (1990)), and then removing the protective group. However, the method of forming the compounds of the present invention is not limited thereto. 3-Phenylpropionaldehydes having various substituents or acetal derivatives thereof can of course be used as precursor aldehydes  in  the  reductive  alkylation  instead  of cinnamaldehydes having various substituents.<br>
As a result of an sensory evaluation, the compounds and the salts thereof in the present invention were found to have a strong sweetening potency and have sensory (organoleptic) properties similar to that of sugar.  For example,  the sweetening     potency     of     N-[N-[3 - (3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)propyl]-L-a-aspartyl]-L-(        a methyl)phenylalanine 1-methyl ester was approximately 18,000 times (relative to sugar), that of N-[N- [3 - (3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl)propyl]-L-a-aspartyl]-L-(a-<br><br>
methy)phenylalanine 1-methyl ester was approximately 18,000 times (relative to sugar), that of N-[N-[3 -(3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)propyl] -L-a-aspartyl]- 3-cyclohexyl-L-alanine 1-methyl ester was approximately 25,000 times (relative to sugar),        that       of       N-[N-[3 -(3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl)propyl]-L-a-aspartyl]-3-cyclohexyl-L-alanine 1-methyl ester was approximately 25,000 times (relative to sugar), that of N-[N-[3 -(3-methylâ¢4-hydroxyphenyl)propyl]-L-a-aspartyl]-3-cyclohexyl-L-alanine  1-methyl  ester  was approximately 40,000 times (relative to sugar).<br>
With respect to the aspartyl dipeptide derivatives (represented by the following general formula (5) ) formed, the structures and the results of the sensory evaluation are shown in Table 1.<br><br><br><br><br>
As understood from the results of Table 1, the novel derivatives in the present invention are excellent in sweetening potency.<br>
When the derivatives (including compounds in the present invention and the salts thereof) of the present invention are used as sweeteners, these may of course be used in combination with other sweeteners unless inviting any special troubles.<br>
When the derivatives of the present invention are used as sweeteners, an appropriate carrier and/or an appropriate bulking agent may be used as required. For example, a carrier, a bulking agent or the like which has been known per se and so far used for the sweeteners is available.<br>
The derivatives of the present invention can be used as sweeteners or ingredients therefor,  and further as sweeteners for products such as foods and the like to which a sweetness has to be imparted, for example, confectionery, chewing  gum,  hygiene  products,  toiletries,  cosmetics, pharmaceutical products and veterinary products for animals. Still further, they can be used as a form of products having sweetness including the derivatives of the present invention and they can be used in a method of imparting sweetness to the products requiring sweetness. The method therefor can be, method known per se, for example, conventional method for using a sweetening ingredient for a sweetener in the sweeteners or<br><br>
the method of imparting sweetness.<br>

(EXAMPLE 1)<br>
Synthesis of N- [N- [3-(3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)propyl] -L-a-aspartyl]-L-( Î±  -methyl) phenylalanine 1-methyl ester<br>
Twenty milliliters of methanol was cooled to 0"C . To this was added 1.09 ml (IS.Ommol) of thionyl chloride by dropping. Then l.Og (5.58mmol) of L-( a-methyl) phenylalanine was added to the mixture and stirred for 1 hour at 0*0 and further over night at TOtD. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure. An aqueous solution of 5% sodium hydrogen carbonate was added to the residue and extracted twice with 50ml of methylene chloride.   The organic layer was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and magnesium sulfate was removed by filtration. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure  to  obtain  0.95g   (4.92mmol)   of  L-(  05  -methyl)phenylalanine methyl ester as an oil.<br><br>
To 30ml of methylene chloride were added 0.95g (4.92inmol) of  L-( a -methyl)phenylalanine methyl  ester and  1.59g (4.92mmol) of N-t-butoxycarbonyl-L-aspartic acid /3 -benzyl ester.
