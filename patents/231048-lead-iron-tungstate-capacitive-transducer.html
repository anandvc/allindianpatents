				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a lead iron tungstate capacitive transducer. More particularly, the invention relates to a lead iron tungstate capacitive pressure transducer with low temperature coefficient, high pressure coefficient and low hysteresis.<br>
 Background of the invention<br>
Measurement of pressure is very vital in industrial manufacturing and processing. Particularly measurement of pressure with accuracy over a wide range is needed in such industries as automobiles, aerospace, steel and for synthesis of high strength materials. In all these industrial sectors, the accuracy in measurement is of paramount importance not only due to quality considerations but also to safety requirements. No single gadget can measure the entire pressure range with the same accuracy and reproducibility. The gadgets may also not be sensitive enough to small changes in pressure and be stable over a wide working temperature (in the range of 10-50°C). A system is therefore required which will have the necessary characteristics of large pressure coefficient to detect small changes even in a large absolute value and have a minimum drift over a large temperature range i.e. have a low temperature coefficient.<br>
Pressure measurements have traditionally been made using a liquid column manometer. While this serves as an absolute instrument, its use is limited to lower ranges for pressure of 0.1 Pa to 200 kPa. Another disadvantage of this device is that it cannot be transported easily from one place to another. P. L. M. Heydemann and B. E. Welch, et al in 'Experimental Thermodynamics', (Vol. II, B. LeNiendre and B. Vodar (eds), Butterworths (1975)), R. S. Dadson, et al in The Pressure Balance: Theory and Practice', National Physical Laboratory, Teddington, England and J. K. N. Sharma and Kamlesh K. Jain, Pramana, J Phys Vol 27 pp 417 (1986) disclose that pressures up to 300MPa can be measured easily by piston gauges and that these piston gauges can be transported after taking certain precautions. However, these piston gauges cannot be used for pressures beyond 300MPa without increasing the size of the entire assembly thereby making it cumbersome to use even with trained manpower. As a result this device is useless for fieldwork.<br>
G. F. Molinar and L. Bianchi and J. K. N. Sharma, et al disclose the use of manganin resistance wires to sense pressures over a wide range. The main drawback of manganin resistance wires is the low accuracy of just ±0.1 % when the requirement normally is of at least ±0.05% or better. Further this sensor has the undesirable property of zero shift with time leading to erroneous measurements and needs stringent temperature control during measurement. While this device may be useful for high-pressure work, the use for low<br>
pressure ranges like 58 Mpa is limited. In order to cover lower ranges one necessarily has to use another device.<br>
Another pressure measuring device is disclosed by A. W. Birks (Report No. 1566 of Queen's University of Belfast). This disclosure describes the device as a Strain Gauge. However, this device also suffers from the same drawbacks as for manganin wire. Further the accuracy in pressure measurement of this device is low due to large hysteresis and zero shift.<br>
Yet another type of a pressure measuring device based on resistance measurement has been disclosed in a US Patent No. 5,578,765. The said patent disclosure teaches that the pressure due to an applied force on a transducer array, essentially consisting of resistive elements leads to a change in the resistance value when the applied force is changed. The dependence of pressure is related to gradual touching of the two arrays thereby decreasing the resistance of the system. The inventors have disclosed curvilinear relation between the measured resistance and the applied pressure. At high pressures, the resistance drops to fairly low values. This low resistance values may not be measurable so accurately thereby leading to possible errors in pressure measurement. Another drawback is that the device of this patent needs a threshold pressure for it to act as a pressure sensor. As a result, the use of this device is limited in respect of pressures lower than the required threshold value.<br>
G. F. Molinar, et al in 1998 attempted to use a ceramic rod to improve upon the existing pressure sensor (Measurement, Vol. 24, pp 161 (1998)). While this pressure transducer had improved resolution and sensitivity, it lacked repeatability and had marked hysteresis. The presence of last property is undesirable as this leads to increased error in the<br>
measured pressure. PCT Application PCT/WO US9405313 discloses a capacitive transducer that can<br>
measure pressure from as lowias 100PSI to 22,000 PSI. However, the structure used is rather complicated - a metal diaphragm is separated from a dielectric alumina by as small a distance as 0.00005 inch and 0.020 inch. This small distance between the metal diaphragm and the insulator disc is difficult to maintain. Further the transducer when needed for a field experiment, does not possess the ruggedness to withstand transit movements. The device of this disclosure also has high hysteresis due to its very structure.<br>
Andeen, et al, in Rev. of Sci. Instruments, Vol. 42, PP 495, (1971), disclose the use of ionic crystals as pressure sensing elements when formed as capacitor in sandwich structure. The pressure measurement is based on the principle of change in capacitance with applied pressure, of the capacitor structure with the material as dielectric medium between two electrodes. However the materials reported showed a larger change in capacitance by a change in temperature (temp, coefficient = 250ppm/°C) and low pressure coefficient (-38 ppm/MPa). As a result, the materials disclosed serve more as temperature sensors rather than pressure sensors.<br>
Kamlesh K. Jain and Subhash C. Kashyap in 'High Temperature and High Pressures' Vol. 27/28 pp 371 (1995), disclose the use of bismuth germanium oxide. It is disclosed that pressure coefficient and temperature coefficient of capacitance are 100 ppm/MPa and 60 ppm/° C. respectively. This is an indication of the utility of variation of capacitance with pressure as a means to measure pressure. The reliability is guaranteed to a certain extent due to low temperature coefficient but not to a level of being used as a pressure gauge.<br>
Yet another material has been disclosed by M. V. Radhika Rao, et al in J Material Science Letter Vol. 12, pp 122 (1997). The material disclosed is a relaxor material with the following composition: 44% Lead Iron Niobate, 44% Lead Zirconium Niobate and 12% Barium Titanate. The pressure coefficient of this complex was observed to increase but without any significant decrease in temperature coefficient thereby again rendering the material not worthy of being used as a pressure transducer with capacitance parameter. Typical sintering process parameter as temperature: 900° C. The pressure coefficient was 430 ppm/MPa while temperature coefficient was +0.002/° C. Thus, the said relaxor material does not have much use as a pressure transducer.<br>
The general draw back in all the prior art disclosure, is, therefore, low accuracy, limited usable pressure range, dependence on the need to maintain precise temperature of the transducer, and hysteresis.<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
In the drawings accompanying this specification;<br>
FIG. 1 represents variation of relative dielectric constant with pressure. Plot (A) is for pure lead<br>
iron tungstate material, (B) is for 1 wt % lead doped material and (C) is for 5 wt % lead doped<br>
material.<br>
FIG. 2 represents variation of relative dielectric constant with temperature of the sample. Plot (A)<br>
is for pure lead iron tungstate material, (B) is for 1 wt % Pb doped material and (C) is for 5 wt %<br>
lead doped material.<br>
FIG. 3 represents variation of relative dielectric constant with pressure. Curve (A) is for the<br>
second calcination temperature of 750° C. Curve (B) is for the second calcination temperature of<br>
810° C. and curve (C) is for the second calcination temperature of 830° C. The sample<br>
temperature during capacitance measurement is 30° C.<br>
FIG. 4 represents variation of relative dielectric constant with temperature of the sample. Curve<br>
(A) is for the second calcination temperature of 750° C. Curve (B) is for the second calcination<br>
temperature of 810° C. and curve (C) is for second calcination temperature of 830° C. The applied<br>
pressure during all measurements was 0.1 MPa.<br>
The relaxor material of the present invention is prepared by solid state sintering. All the starting materials are pure and preferably have a purity of at least 99.9%. The materials are weighed in such quantities so as to yield the final material as an undoped stoichiometric Pb(Fe2/3 Wi/3)O3, (PFW). The same material can also be prepared by using excess PbO such that a self-doped stoichiometric PFW is obtained. Doping is done by putting excess amount of PbO salt in the initial mixture for wet grinding, for homogenization of the material.<br>
Excess amount of lead oxide is added to compensate for any loss of the lead component due to high vapour pressure during high temperature treatment. The other advantage of adding excess lead oxide is to get self-doping of lead in the final material to see the effect on the characteristics.<br>
The weighed and wet ground material is then calcined to effect the complete reaction of the oxides to form the PFW. The calcination is generally done at a temperature of at least 800°C for a period of 2 hours. The calcined material is further ground for about ten hours. This long duration grinding is necessary to ensure complete homogenization of the mixed and reacted constituents. A binder, preferably polyvinyl alcohol was added to this powder. This mixture is then put in a pelletising machine for making samples.<br>
— In a preferred embodiment, two-step calcination process for the preparation of lead iron tungstate relaxor material is used. In this method, referred to as Columbite method, all the starting materials are pure and preferably have a purity of at least 99.9%. The materials are weighed in such quantities so as to yield the final material as a stoichiometric Pb(Fe2/3 W1/3)O3 herein after referred to as PFW. The appropriate weighed amount of the wet ground iron oxide and tungsten oxide is mixed and then calcined at a temperature of preferably at 1000°C for a period of 2 hours. The calcined material is further ground for about ten hours after mixing the lead oxide. This long duration grinding is necessary to ensure complete homogenization of the mixed and reacted constituents. The mixed calcined powder is again calcined at a temperature in a range of 750 to 830°C and preferably at a temperature of 810°C. A binder, preferably polyvinyl alcohol is added to this powder. This mixture is then put in a pelletising machine for making disc shaped samples.<br>
Typical size of the samples in both the preferred embodiments of preparation of relaxor material was, but not limited to, 18 mm in diameter and 1.5 mm thickness. The PFW samples prepared were then used to determine the parameters for pressure measurement. These samples were coated with a silver film on both sides by vacuum evaporation to complete the capacitive structure. The electrode structure was such that one flat surface of the<br>
disc was coated completely by a thin film of, preferably, silver. The other flat surface opposite to the first surface of the pellet was also coated with the silver film through a thin wire ring mask such that a central circular portion of the coated film was formed along with a peripheral annular concentric film at the rim. All the depositions were done by standard vacuum thermal evaporation systems. The two portions were separated by a narrow clear annular concentric space. Width of this clear annular space was typically 50 λ. The annular concentric ring was used to eliminate errors due to stray capacitance during ac measurements. Thin silver wires of purity 99.99% wee attached to the metal electrodes.<br>
The so formed capacitive structure was then used to measure the thermal coefficient and the pressure coefficient of the doped and undoped PFW material prepared by the two preferred embodiments of this invention for the preparation of relaxor material.<br>
For temperature and pressure measurement, the capacitive structure was placed in a standard specimen holder. This holder was placed in a conventional high pressure vessel. Temperature of the vessel was maintained to within ± 0.05° C using temperature bath (Model No. RTE 8DD, NESLAB, USA). Pressure was transmitted through diethyl hexyl sebacate fluid. At a preset constant temperature, pressure was varied gradually from atmospheric pressure (0.1 MPa to 415 Mpa) and the variation in the capacitance of the specimen was measured at fixed frequency of 1 khz by the automatic capacitance bridge (Andeen Hagerling, model 2500 A, USA). During the measurement of pressure characteristics of the relaxor material, the data were taken of variation of capacitance with pressure increasing in magnitude as well as with decreasing pressure from the maximum pressure applied. This was done to determine the hysteresis in the material.<br>
FIG. 1 shows the variation of the ratio K/Kowith applied pressure at a sample temperature of 30° C. The ratio K/Ko is determined by calculating the dielectric constants K and Ko from the measured capacitance using the formula as given below:<br>
Thickness of parallel   X  capacitance<br>
Dielectric constant =   	<br>
Electrical permittivity of vacuum X area of parallel plate<br>
Here K is the dielectric constant with pressure applied and K.sub.O is the dielectric constant without any applied pressure.<br>
In FIG. 1, plot (A) is the variation of K/Ko with pressure for undoped relaxor material and shows a near straight line without any hysteresis. Plot (B) in the same figure is for doped material with 1 wt % Pb. The slope of this line is seen to be more than that of (A) indicating the role of doping in improving pressure characteristics. This is due to the fact that a small change in pressure results in a large change in dielectric constant. Curve (C) is for a 5 wt % doped lead material which further gives an enhanced slope of the curve between K/Ko and pressure. Thus, increased doping leads to better characteristics of the material. The pressure coefficient being<br>
calculated by using the following expression:<br>
Change in dielectric constant<br>
Pressure cofficient =   	<br>
Initial dielectric constant X change in pressure<br>
Next keeping a fixed pressure say of 0.1 MPa, temperature was varied from 10° C to 50° C to measure the temperature coefficient of capacitance.<br>
During the measurement of temperature characteristics of the relaxor material, data was taken of variation of capacitance with temperature increasing in magnitude as well as with decreasing temperature from the maximum temperature reached in order to determine the hysteresis in the material.<br>
From the capacitance data and the dielectric constant, temperature coefficient and the pressure coefficient of the specimen were calculated using following formulas<br>
Change in the dielectric constant<br>
Temperature coefficient  =   	<br>
Initial dielectric constant X change in temperature<br>
The dielectric constant was determined using the capacitance value and other material parameters and constants from the expressions given earlier in the description.<br>
FIG. 2 shows the variation of K/Ko as a function of temperature at a given fixed pressure, say 0.1 MPa. Curve (A) is for undoped material while (B) and (C) are for 1 wt % and 5 wt % doped materials respectively. Plot (A) in the figure gives the slope of the variation as higher than that for plot (B) and (C). This clearly indicates that doping by lead improves the temperature behavior of the lead iron tungstate and that the material can be easily put to use as a pressure transducer having the desired property of high pressure coefficient, and low temperature coefficient.<br>
FIG. 3 shows the variation of the ratio K/Ko for the lead iron tungstate relaxor material samples prepared with the two-step calcination (Columbite process), with applied pressure at a sample temperature of 30° C., maintained to within ± 0.05° C. The ratio K/Ko is determined by calculating the dielectric constants K/Ko from the measured capacitance using the following formula:<br>
Thickness of parallel X capacitance<br>
Dielectric constant =   	<br>
Electrical permittivity of vacuum X area of parallel plate<br>
K is the dielectric constant with pressure applied and K0 is the dielectric constant without any applied pressure.<br>
In FIG. 3 plot (A) is the variation of K/K0 with pressure for the relaxor material and shows a near straight line without any hysteresis. The plot is for a sample which was calcined<br>
for a second time at 750°C after mixing required quantity of lead oxide for a stoichiometric material. Plot (B) in the same figure is for material with second calcination temperature of 810°C. The slope of this line is seen to be a bit less than that of (A) indicating the role of increase in sintering temperature on the pressure characteristics. Curve (C) is for a sample with second calcination temperature of 830°C, which shows some anomalous behaviour but has a tendency to give enhanced slope of the curve between K/Ko and pressure. This points to the fact that increase in cacination temperature may affect the pressure characteristics. The pressure coefficient being calculated by using the following expression:<br>
Change in dielectric constant<br>
Pressure coefficient =		<br>
Initial Dielectric Constant, x change in pressure<br>
Next keeping a fixed pressure say of 0.1 MPa, temperature of the sample was varied from 10°C to 50°C to measure the temperature coefficient of capacitance.<br>
During the measurement of temperature characteristics of the relaxor material, the data were taken of variation of capacitance with temperature increasing in magnitude as well as with decreasing temperature from the maximum temperature reached This was done to determine the hysteresis in the material.<br>
From the capacitance data the dielectric constant, temperature coefficient of the specimen were calculated using following formula<br>
Change in the dielectric constant<br>
Temperature coeffcient =		<br>
Initial Dielectric Constant x change in temperature<br>
The dielectric constant was determined using the capacitance value and other material parameters and constants from the expressions given earlier in the description.<br>
Figure 4 shows the variation of K/Ko, as a function of temperature at a given fixed pressure, say 0.1 MPa. Here KO is the dielectric constant at 10°C. Plot (A) is the variation of K/Ko with temperature for the relaxor material and does not show any hysteresis. The plot is for a sample, which was calcined for a second time at 750°C after mixing the required quantity of lead oxide for a stoichiometric material. The curve shows a negative slope and decreasing with increasing temperature. This means that the material has a better temperature characteristic when worked at slightly higher temperature. Plot (B) in the same figure is for a material with second calcination temperature of 810°C. (B) in the figure gives the slope of the variation as higher than that for plot (A) though still being negative in the temperature range<br>
studied. Curve (C) is for a sample with second calcination temperature of 830°C. This curve shows an anomalous behavior compared to (A) and (B) but is still capable of being used as a pressure transducer. This is clearly indicative of the fact that the present process which does not use any doping material can be easily put to use as a pressure transducer having the desired property of high pressure coefficient and low temperature coefficient.<br>
The above mentioned behavior in pressure and temperature characteristics may well be attributed to increase in grain size of the polycrystalline material which is formed as perovskite phase.<br>
The scientific principle underlying the use of lead iron tungstate relaxor material for pressure measurement lies in the fact that these materials show a large change in capacitance per unit change in applied pressure. In other words these materials have a large pressure coefficient of capacitance. Another characteristic of the material is that it has a low value for temperature coefficient. This property is very desirable and essential for the material to act as a pressure sensor usable in an environment where temperature fluctuations are inevitable. Also the material to be useful as a pressure sensor should not have a memory effect i.e. should not have a hysteresis.<br>
The novelty of the relaxor material of the present invention lies in its having low temperature coefficient, high gressure coefficient and low hysteresis due to the inventive step of doping by lead in excess of 1% of lead to the parent lead iron tungstate material.<br>
For preparing the Lead Iron Tungstate [Pb(Fe2/3 W1/3)O3 - specimens abbreviated as PFW], starting oxides were PbO, Fe2O3 and WO3. Specimens were prepared using following formula<br>
PbO + 1/3 Fe2O3 + 1/3 WO3 + X<br>
where X is the excess (0%, 1%, 5%) wt. % of PbO. PFW was prepared as 7 gm sample by taking 4.4171 gm of PbO, 1.0535 gm of Fe2O3and 1.5294 gm of WO3. In the two-step Coulumbite process X was zero.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration only and should not be construed to<br>
limit the scope of the invention.<br>
Example-l<br>
Weighed quantities of lead oxide, tungsten trioxide and ferric oxide were taken and mixed and wet ground in acetone for 10 hours. This mixture was then calcined at 810°C for 2h. The calcined powder was further ground for 10 hours. To this ground calcined powder, polyvinyl alcohol was added as binder, for making circular pellets of diameter 18 mm and<br>
