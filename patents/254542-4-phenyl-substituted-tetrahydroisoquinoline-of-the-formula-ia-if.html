4-PHENYL-SUBSTITUTED TETRAHYDROISOQUINOLINES AND USE THEREOF TO BLOCK REUPTAKE OF NOREPINEPHRINE, DOPAMINE AND SEROTONIN<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to compounds, compositions, methods for the trearment of various neurological and psychological disorders, and the use of the compounds in combination therapy. In particular, the present invention relates to such compounds, compositions and methods wherein the compounds are novel 4-phenyl substituted tetrahydroisoquinolines derivatives.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine are known to be important chemical messengers participating in the transmission of nerve impulses in the brain. These messengers are liberated at specific sites on pre-synaptic cells and received, to complete transmission of the impulse, at specific sites on post-synaptic cells. Their effect is then terminated by metabolism or by uptake into the pre-synaptic cells. Drugs capable of blocking the pre-synaptosomal uptake of either of these chemical messengers in the brain, are useful in alleviating disorders associated with decreased levels of these chemical messengers. For example, duloxetine and fluoxetine which arc known serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been found to be useful in the treatment of depression, obesity and obsessive-compulsive disease (Wong, et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,532,244). Also. Moldi. et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,444,070. discloses the use of dopamine reuptake inhibitors in the treatment of depression. Parkinsonism, drug addiction and/or abuse, cocaine and/or amphetamine addiction and/or abuse. Freedman, et al., U.S. Patent No. 6,136.803 also discloses synaptic norepinephrine or serotonin uptake inhibitors which are useful in treating depression in a patient. Furthermore, Norden, U.S. Patent No. 5.789,449 discloses the use of serotonin re-uptake inhibitors in treating psychiatric symptoms consisting of anger, rejection sensitivity, and lack of mental or physical energy. Also, Foster, et al., U.S. Patent No. 4.902,710. discloses the use of serotonin and norepinephrine uptake inhibitors in suppressing the desire of humans to smoke or consume alcohol. Thus, there continues to remain a need to develop novel compounds which block reuptake of norephinephrine, dopamine or serotonin.<br>
Compounds which inhibit the reuptake of serotonin or norephinephrine. have also been used in combination therapy. For example. Glatt. ei al., U.S. Patent no. 6,121,261 discloses the use of selective serotonin reuptake Inhibitors or norephinephrine uptake inhibitiors. in combination with neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist for treating attention deficit disorder in a patient.<br>
Also, Hohenwarter, U.S. Patent No. 4.843,071 discloses the use of a norepinephrine re-uptakc inhibitor and a norepinephrine precursor in the treatment of obesity, drug abuse, or narcolepsy in a patient. Furthermore. Wong, et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,532.244, discloses the use of serotonin reuptake inhibitors in combination with a serotonin IA receptor antagonist, to increase the availability of serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine in the brain.<br><br>
The treatment of a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders is characterized by a number of side effects believed to be due to the compounds' inability to selectvely block certain neurochemicals, and not others. ADHD, for example, is a disease affecting 3-6% of school age children, and is also recognized in percentage of adults. Aside from hampering performance at school, and at work, ADHD is a significant risk factor for the subsequent development of anxiety disorders, depression, conduct disorder and drug abuse. Since current treatment regimes require psychostimulants, and since a substantial number of patients (30%) are resistant to stimulants or cannot tolerate their side effects, there is a need for a new drug or class of drugs which treats ADHD and does not have resistance or side effect problems. In addition, methylphenidate, the current drug of choice for the treatment of ADHD, induces a number of side effects; these include anorexia, insomnia and jittery feelings, tics, as well as increased blood pressure and heart rate secondary to the activation of the sympathetic nervous system. However, Methylphenidate also has a high selectivity for the dopamine transporter protein over the norepinephrine transporter protein (DAT/NET Ki ratio of 0.1), which can lead to addiction liability and requires multiple doses per day for optimal efficacy. Thus, there continues to remain a need to develop novel compounds which block reuptake of norephinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin with particular selectivity ratios.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 3,947,456, discloses tetrahydroisoquinolines which are said to have utility as anti-depressants. U.S. Patent No. 3,666,763, describes the use of phenyl tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives as antidepressants and antihypotensives. Canadian Patent Application No. 2,015J 14, discloses the use of phenyl tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives as antidepressants; moreover, described therein are apparently nonselective as to norepinephrine, serotonin and dopamine uptake. UK Patent Application No. 2.271,566 , discloses the use of phenyl tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives as anti-HIV agents. PCT International Application No. WO98/40358 discloses the use of phenyl tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives to be useful in the treatment of disorders of glucose metabolic pathways. W097/36876 discloses the use of phenyl tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives as anticancer agents. W097/23458 also describes 4 phenyl-substiiuted tetrahydroisoquinolines as NMDA receptor ligands useful for conditions associated with neuronal loss. Phenyl-substituted tetrahydroisoquinolines are also described in Mondeshka et al I] Farmaco, 1994,49 pp. 475-481.<br>
Nomofensine® which is a 4 phenyl-substituted tetrahydroisoquinoline derivative is known to inhibit the neuronal uptake of dopamine and other catecholamines and has shown clinical efficacy for ADHD. However, long term administration of Nomofensine® results in fatal immune hemolytic anemia.   Thus, there continues to remain a need to develop novel compounds which treat ADHD but do not have the serious side effects associated with Nomifensine® or the currently prescribed psychostimulants.<br>
The present invention discloses novel arvl and heteroaryl substituted tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives compounds which block reuptake of norephinephrine. dopamine, or serotonin, and are useful<br><br>
as alternatives to methylphenidate, and known psychostimulants, in the treatment of ADHD and other neurological and psychiatric disorders.<br>
The present inventors have discovered that the claimed compounds which block reuptake of norephinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin with particular selectivity ratios, e.g., being more selective for the norepinephrine transporter (NET) protein than dopamine transporter (DAT) protein or serotonin transporter (SERT) protein (lower Ki for NET than for DAT and SERT). It is postulated that the compounds would therefore be effective as an ADHD treatment with reduced addictive liability profiles. In particular, someof the compounds of this invention are surprisingly and particularly selective for NET over the SERT protein, thus also affording compounds without the known side effect profiles of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class of compounds.<br>

Preparation of Compounds of the Invention<br>
Compounds according to the invention, for example, starting materials, intermediates or products, are prepared as described herein or by the application or adaptation of known methods, by which is meant methods used heretofore or described in the literature.<br>
Compounds useful according to the invention may be prepared by the application or adaptation of known methods, by which is meant methods used heretofore or described in the literature, for example those described by R. C. Larock in Comprehensive Organic Transformations, VCH publishers. 1989.<br>
A compound of formulae (1A-F) including a group containing one or more nitrogen ring atoms. may be converted to the coiresponding compound wherein one or more nitrogen ring atom of the group is oxidized to an N-oxide, preferably by reacting with a peracid, for example peracetic acid in acetic acid or m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane, at a temperature from about room temperature to reflux, preferably at elevated temperature.<br>
In the reactions described hereinafter it may be necessary to protect reactive functional groups, for example hydroxy, amino, imino, thio or carboxy groups, where these are desired in the final product, to avoid their unwanted panicipation in the reactions.   Conventional protecting groups may be used in accordance with standard practice, for examples see T.W. Green and P.G.M.Wuts in "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry" John Wiley and Sons, 1991; J. F. W. McOmie in "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry" Plenum Press, 1973.<br>
Compounds provided herein are synthesized, for example, using the methods described below (see Schemes 1-4), together with methods known in the art of synthetic organic chemistry, or variations<br><br>
thereon as appreciated by those skilled in the art. Preferred methods include, but are not limited to, those methods described below.<br>
Compounds of formulae (lA-F) of this invention are. for example, prepared according to Scheme ]. Treatment of an optionally substituted acetophenone of formula (II) with common brominating agents such as, but not limited to, bromine, NBS, or tetrabuiylammonium tribromide readily affords the desired bromoacetophenones of formula (III, X=Br). These reactions are optimally conducted in acetic acid or methylene chloride with methanol used as a co-solvent for the tribromide reagent with reaction temperatures at or below room temperature. Another embodiment of this methodology would include compounds of formula (IIT X=C1).<br>
The acetophenones of formula (Ilj are available from commercial sources or are conveniently obtained via several well known methods, including the treatment of the corresponding benzoic acid intermediates with two stoichiometric equivalents of methyllithium as thoroughly described in the review of Jorgenson, M.J. (Organic Reactions. 1970, 18, pg. 1). Alternatively, one may treat the corresponding benzaldehydes with an alkyl-Grignard (for example, MeMgBr) or alkyl-lithium (for example, MeLi) nucleophile foUwed by routine oxidation to the ketone as well demonstrated by Larock, R.C. (Comprehensive Organic Transformations. VCH Publishers, New York, 1989, p. 604).<br>
Treatment of intermediates of formula (III) with intermediates of formula (R3,R4.ph)-CH(R2)-<br>
NHR* cleanly generates the alkylation products of formula (V)- The alkylation reactions may be run under a wide variety of conditions familiar to one skilled in the an of organic synthesis. Typical solvents include acetonitrile, toluene, diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dimethylsulfoxide, dimethylformamide, methylene chloride, and lower alkyl alcohols including eihanol. The reactions may be successfully rim<br>
at temperatures ranging from 0oC up to the boiling point of the solvent employed. Reaction progress is conventionally determined by standard chromatographic and spectroscopic methods. The alkylation reaction is optionally run with the addition of a non-nucleophilic organic base such as, but not limited to. pyridine, triethylamine and diisopropyl eihylamine.<br>
The R'-substituted N-benzvl amines of formula (R3.R4-Ph)-CH(R2)-NHRl may be purchased from commercial sources, or alternatively, obtained from a simple reductive amination protocol. Thus,<br>
carbonyl containing compounds of Formulae (IV, Scheme I) may be treated with H2N-R^ in lower alkyl<br>
alcoholic solvents (preferably methanol) at temperatures at or below room temperature. The resulting imine may be reduced most commonly with alkaline eanh borohvdrides (preferably sodium borohydnde) to provide the desired amine intermediate.<br>
Reductions of compounds of formula (V) to the benzyl alcohols of formula (VI) proceeds with many reducing agents including, as example, sodium borohydride, lithium borohydride. borane, diisobutylaluminum hydride, and lithium aluminum hvdride. The reductions are carried out for a period<br><br>
of time between 1 hour to 3 days at room temperature or elevated temperature up to the reflux point of the solvent employed. If borane is used, it may be employed as a complex for example, but not limited to, borane-methyl sulfide complex, borane-piperidine complex, borane-tetrahydrofuran complex. One skilled in the art will understand the optimal combination of reducing agents and reaction conditions needed or may seek guidance from the text of Larock, R.C. {Comprehensive Organic Transformations, VCH Publishers, New York, 1989, p. 527).<br>
Compounds of formula (VI) may be cyclized to the target compounds of formulae lA-IF of this invention by brief treatment with a strong acid. Suitable acids include, but are not limited to, concentrated sulfuric acid, polyphosphoric acid, methanesulfonic acid and trifluoroacetic acid. The reactions are run neat or in the optional presence of a co-solvent such as, for example, methylene<br>
chloride and 1,2-dichloroethane. The cyclizations may be conducted at temperatures ranging from 0oC up to the reflux point of the solvent employed. One skilled in the art of heterocyclic chemistry will readily understand these conditions or may consult the teachings of Mondeshka, et aL (II Fannaco. 1994, 49, 475-480) or Venkov, et al. {Synthesis, 1990, 253-255). Cyclizations may also be effected by treatment of compounds of formula (VI) with strong Lewis Acids, such as for example, aluminum trichloride typically in halogenated solvents such as methylene chloride. One skilled in the art will be familiar with the precedent taught by Kaiser, et al. (J, Med. Chem., 1984, 27, 28-35) and Wyrick, et al. (J. Med. Chem,, 1981, 24, 1013-1015).<br>
Compounds of formulae lA-IF may be obtained in enantiomerically pure (R) and (S) form by crystallization with chiral salts as well known to one skilled in the art. or alternatively, may be isolated through chiral HPLC employing commercially available chiral columns.<br>
Alternatively, compounds of formulae (V) and (VI) may be arrived at as described in Scheme 2.<br>
Thus, the haloacetophenones of formula may be treated with simple amines of formula H2N-R' under<br>
alkylaiion conditions as described above {vide supra) to provide compounds of formulae (VII). A second alkylation may then be performed utilizing reagents of formula (VIII) where X represents a leaving group, such as for example, but not limited to, halogen, mesylate, or tosylate to afford the common intermediate of formula (V). Reagents of formula (VIII) are in turn available from the appropriately substituted carbonyl compound of formula (IV) via reduction {vide supra) and activation.<br>
Activation to leaving group X is effected by treatment of the alcohol with methanesulfonyl chloride or p-toluenesulfonyl chloride in the presence of a non-nucieophiiic base such as. but not limited to, L5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-5-ene (DBN). pyridine or triethylamine. The reaction is commonly performed in halogenated organic solvent, for example, methylene chloride, and at temperatures from -<br>
78oC up to the boiling point of the solvent employed. Benzylic activation to Leaving Group X may also be effected by treatment with halogenating agents such as, but not limited to, SO2CI2, Cb. PCI5. Bro.<br><br>
CuBr2, NBS, and CBr4. The various conditions necessary to accomplish this transformation will be<br>
readily apparent to those skilled in the art of organic chemistry and additional reference on benzylic activiation may be sought from Larock, R.C. (Comprehensive Organic Transformations. VCH Publishers, New York, 1989, p. 313).<br>
The flexibility of the synthesis is funher demonstrated by an alternative sequence of reaction*^, wherein (VII) may be reduced (vide supra) and either i) alkylated as above with (VIII) to afford (VI) or<br>
ii) condensed with (IV) followed by in-sim imine reduction to also afford (VI). Where R5=R6=R7_H and the (methylaminomethyl)benzyl alcohol derivative may be obtained from commercial sources.<br>
Compounds of formulae lA-IF of this invention may also be prepared according to Scheme 3. Treatment of an appropriately substituted 2-iodobenzaldehyde (or a 2-bromobenzaldehyde) (X) with an<br>
amine H2N-R' in lower alkyl alcohol solvents followed by reduction of the resultant imine as described<br>
above in Scheme 1 {vide supra) affords an intermediate (2-1 or Br),R2.R3-PhCH2-NH-R' which, when<br>
treated with an optionally substituted bromoacetophenone (as described for the synthesis of (V), Scheme 1) provides the alkylation product (XI).<br>
Compounds of formula (XI) may be treated with strong bases, such as, but not limited to lower alkyl (C]_5) lithium bases (preferably t-BuLi or n-BuLi) to afford the anticipated halogen-metal<br>
exchange followed by intramolecular Barbier cyclization to generate compounds of formulae (lA-IE,<br>
R8=0H). Inert solvents such as dialkyl ethers (preferably diethyl ether), cyclic ethers (preferably<br>
tetrahydrofuran or 1,4-dioxane), etc. are necessar)', and reaction temperatures are kept low (-78^C to -<br>
25^G) to avoid by-products. Alternatively, halogen-metal exchange may also be effected in the presence of zerovalent nickel, in which case N,N-dialkylformamides (preferably dimethylformamide) serve as ideal solvents. One skilled in the art of organic synthesis will understand the optimal combination of conditions and may seek further reference from Kihara, et al. {Tetrahedron. 1992, 48. 67-78), and Blomberg. ei aL {Synthesis, 1977, p. 18-30). Additionally, compounds of formulae (lA-E. R'=OH) may<br>
be readily alkylated (vide supra) to afford compounds formulae (lA-E, R^==OR^ ')• Finally, funher<br>
treatment of compounds of formulae (lA-E, RS=:OH) with a halogenating reagent or specifically a fluorinating reagent such as, but not limited to, diethylaminosulfur irifluoride (DAST), readily provides<br>
compounds of formulae (lA-F. R^=F). Funher reference may be gained from the review of Hudlicky (Organic Reaciions, 1985, 35, p. 513-637j.<br>
Compounds of formulae lA-F of this invention may also be prepared according to Scheme 4. 4-Bromoisoquinolines (XII) may be treated with an aryl boronic acid or aryl boronic acid ester where Y is<br>
equivalent to B(OH)2 or B(ORA)(ORB) (where Ra and Rb are lower alkyl, ie. C1-C6. or taken together, Ra and Rb are lower alkylene. ie. C2-C ] -)) in the presence of a metal catalyst with or without a base in<br><br>
an inert solvent to give isoquinoline compounds of formula (XIII). Metal catalysts include, but are not limited to, salts or phosphine complexes of Cu, Pd, or Ni (eg. Cu(OAc)2, PdCl2(PPh3)2, NiCl2(PPh3)2). Bases may include, but are not limited to, alkaline earth metal carbonates, alkaline earth metal bicarbonates, alkaline earth metal hydroxides, alkali metal carbonates, alkali metal bicarbonates, alkali metal hydroxides, alkali metal hydrides (preferably sodium hydride), alkali metal alkoxides (preferably sodium methoxide or sodium ethoxide), alkaline earth metal hydrides, alkali metal dialkylamides (preferably lithium diisopropylamide), alkali metal bis(trialkylsilyl)amides (preferably sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide), trialkyl amines (preferably diisopropylethylamine or triethylamine) or aromatic amines (preferably pyridine). Inert solvents may include, but are not limited to acetonitrile, dialkyl ethers (preferably diethyl ether), cyclic ethers (preferably tetrahydrofuran or 1,4-dioxane), N,N-dialkylaceiamides (preferably dimethylacetamide), N,N-dialkylformamides (preferably dimethylformamide), dialkylsulfoxides (preferably dimethylsulfoxide), aromatic hydrocarbons (preferably benzene or toluene) or haloaalkanes (preferably methylene chloride). Prefered reaction temperatures range from room temperature up to the boiling point of the solvent employed. The reactions may be run in conventional glassware or in one of many commercially available parallel synthesizer units. Non-commercially available boronic acids or boronic acid esters may be obtained from the corresponding optionally substituted aryl halide as described by Gao, et al. {Tetrahedron, 1994, 50. 979-988).<br>
Compounds of formula (XIII) are converted into the target tetrahydroisoquinolines of formula<br>
via a two-step procedure employing first amine quaicmization with a reagent R'-LG, where LG represents a suitable leaving group such as I. Br, O-triflate. 0-tosylate, 0-methanesulfonate, etc. The reactions are optimally conducted in haloaalkanes (preferably methylene chloride), dialkyl ethers (preferably diethyl ether), cyclic ethers (preferably tetrahydrofuran or 1,4-dioxane) or other inert solvent. The reactions are optimally conducted at or below room temperature and reaction times vary from 10 minutes to 24 hours. The second step of the sequence involves reduction to the tetrahydroisoquinolines of formulae lA-F. Optimally, a mild reducing agent is employed, such as for example, sodium cyanoborohydride in the presence of acid catalyst to facilitate the reaction. Additional guidance for effectively conducting this chemistry may be located from the works of Miller, et al. {Synthetic Communications, 1994, 24. 1187-1193) and Terashima. ei at.

Binding Assavs Primary binding assays:<br>
In order to evaluate the relative affinity of the various compounds at the NE, DA and 5HT transporters, HEK293E cell lines were developed to express each of the three human transporters. cDNAs containing the complete coding regions of each transporter were amplified by PCR from human brain libraries. The cDNAs contained in pCRII vectors were sequenced to verify their identity and then subcloned into an Epsiein-Barr virus based expression plasmid (E. Shen, GM Cooke, RA Horlick, Gene 156:235-239, 1995). This plasmid containing the coding sequence for one of the human transporters was transfected into HEK293E cells. Successful transfection was verified by the ability of known reuptake blockers to inhibit the uptake of tritiated NE, DA or 5HT.<br>
For binding, cells were homogenized, centrifuged and then resuspended in incubation buffer (50mM Tris, 120mM NaCl, 5mM KCl, pH 7.4). Then the appropriate radioligand was added. For NET binding, ['H] Nisoxetine (86.0 Ci/mmol, NEN/DuPont) was added to a final concentration of approximately 5 nM. For DAT binding, [H] WIN 35,428 (84,5 Ci/mmol) at 15 nM was added. For 5HTT binding, ['H] Citolapram (85.0 Ci/mmol) at 1 nM was added. Then various concentrations (10^-5 to 10-l 1 M) of the compound of interest were added to displace the radioligand. Incubation was carried out at room temperature for 1 hour in a 96 well plate. Following incubation, the plates were placed on a harvester and washed quickly 4 times with (50mM iris, 0.9% NaCI, pH 7.4) where the cell membranes containing the bound radioactive label were trapped on Whatman GF/B filters. Scintillation cocktail was added to the filters which were then counted in a Packard TopCount. Binding affinities of the compounds of interest were determined by non-linear curve regression using GraphPad Prism 2.01 software. Non-specific binding was determined by displacement with 10 micromolar mazindol.<br>
TBZ assay:<br>
In order to assess in vivo activity of the compounds at the NE and DA transporters, their ability to prevent the sedative effects of tetrabcnazine (TBZ) was determined (G. Slille, Arzn. Forsch 14:534-537, 1964). MaleCFl mice (Charles River Breeding Laboratories) weighing 18-25 gm at the time of testing, are housed a minimum of06 days under carefully controlled environmental conditions (22.2 + 1.1 C; 50% average humidity; 12 hr lighting cycle/24 hr). Mice are fasted overnight (16-22 hr) prior to testing. Mice are placed into clear polycarbonated "shoe" boxes (17 cm x 28.5 cm x 12 cm). Randomized and coded doses of test compounds are administered p.o. A 45 mg/kg dose of tetrabcnazine is administered i.p. 30 minutes prior to score time. All compounds are administered in a volume of 0.1 ml/10 gm body weight. Animals are evaluated for antagonism of tetrabcnazine induced exploratory loss<br><br>
and ptosis at specified time intervals after drug administration. At the designated time interval, mice are examined for signs of exploratory activity and ptosis. Exploratory activity is evaluated by placing the animal in the center of a 5 inch circle. Fifteen seconds are allowed for the animal to move and intersect the perimeter. This is considered antagonism of tetrabenazine and given a score of 0. Failure to leave the circle is regarded as exploratory loss and given a score of 4. An animal is considered to have ptosis if its eyelids are at least 50% closed and given a score of 4 if completely closed. No closure is given a score of 0. Greater than 95% of the control (vehicle-treated) mice are expected to exhibit exploratorv' loss ai.d ptosis. Drug activity is calculated as the percentage of mice failing to respond to the tetrabenazine challenge dose. Statistical evaluation.:<br>
Median effective doses (ED50s) and 95% confidence limits are determined numerically by the methods of Thompson (1947) and Litchfield and Wilcoxon (1949).<br><br><br>
