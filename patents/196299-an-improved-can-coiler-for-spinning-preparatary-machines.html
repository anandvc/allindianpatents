The invention relates to an improved can coiler for sliver depositing and the invention particularly relates to an improved can coiler for spinning preparatory machines such as drawing frames and carders . The can coiler of the present invention is useful for depositing the sliver gently on to the sliver cans at higher delivery speeds. The can coiler is also known in the filed as rotary plate.<br>
The can coiler of the present invention is useful in combination with the presently available high speed textile machines, particularly Card and Draw frames to ensure that the sliver is deposited in to the sliver cans with highest degree of evenness and gentleness by adopting appropriate construction of the sliver channel .<br>
The existence of can coilers /rotary plate for sliver depositing are very well known. DE -PS patent no 15 10 310- discloses a rotary plate for depositing fiber slivers in spinning cans. In this, rotary plate for depositing fiber slivers in spinning can is provided with channel guiding the fiber sliver from an inlet element letting out at the top and in the rotational axis of the rotary plate via a curve in the form of an arc to an outlet element which is tangential to the rotary plate and letting out approximately at its circumference . Between the inlet element and its outlet element, the channel is provided with a straight and radially extending intermediate piece .<br>
It is observed that such a rotary plate has the disadvantage of poor and uneven sliver deposit especially when used in combination with the modem high speed machines.<br><br>
Another can coiler /rotary plate has been disclosed in DE-PS 1115 623 . In this device the channel is made up telescopically of at least two pipe bends in the form of arcs and circle. The course of the channel can be adapted to the different can diameters by means of the telescope like construction of the pipe bends. The two pipe bends are provided with straight ends at their connection point.<br>
This device has also the disadvantage of poor and uneven sliver deposit especially when used in combination with the modern high speed machines. In addition it has the disadvantage of that the fiber sliver must be led over the edge of the pipe bend and goes through a changed channel profile .Especially in modern high speed machines such a construction is not very conducive to great precision in the deposit of the fiber sliver and for careful handling of the fiber sliver. Deposit may form at the edge of the device and become detached from time to time thereby leading to irregularities in the fiber sliver.<br>
In the Indian patent nol81082 dated 7th October 1992 { corresponding to the US patent no 5317786) another can coiler/ rotary plate has been disclosed which has a spatially curved sliver channel which is fomied from a tubular piece having two directly merging arcs , the sliver channel and / or cover of the rotary plate on the underside thereof is advantageously made of refined steel . This can coiler is shown in Fig 1 of the drawing accompanying this specification It has been sated that by such an arrangement ,it is ensured that a deposition which is as even and as gentle to the sliver as possible.<br>
In an another Indian patent no 181273 dated 19lh January 1993 a can coiler /revolving plate for a spinning preparation machine has been disclosed comprising a base body with an un machined surface having a large degree of surface roughness and a cover of low friction material fitted on the underside<br><br>
of the revolving plate . By such a construction it is sated that the rejection rate during manufacturing process is reduced . Such a can coiler is shown in Fig 2.<br>
In yet another Indian patent no 181435 dated 19th January 1993 a silver channel for a spinning preparation machine for depositing sliver in a container has been disclosed wherein the sliver channel is made in the form of a helix of varying pitch .It is stated that for more even guidance and more cost effective production of the sliver channel it is advantages to have a constant and circular cross section. Accordingly the helical form for the sliver channel has been proposed according to this patent. This is shown in Fig 3.<br>
Due to the advancement of the technology and the availability of high speed spinning machines it has become necessary that appropriate improvements have also to be made on various aspects of the rotary plate so as to match the above machines. Under the above said circumstances regular work is being conducted to find out better performance of spinning machines. From the above survey of prior art it can be observed that one of the areas where improvements are taking place is in respect of the construction of the rotary plates especially in the sliver channel.<br>
Objective of the invention:<br>
It is therefore the main object of the present invention to provide an improved rotary plate for sliver depositing particularly in drawing frames and carders .<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved rotary plate for sliver depositing particularly in drawing frames and carders ensuring a regular deposit of fiber slivers that will not damage the fibers in the fiber container especially in a rapid spinning plant preparation machine.<br><br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved rotary plate for sliver depositing particularly in drawing frames and carders which ensures even and as gentle deposit of sliver as possible which will retain the quality of the fibers produced by the machines to which the rotary plate is provided.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved rotary plate for sliver depositing which facilitates smooth guidance of the sliver through the sliver channel.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved rotary plate for sliver depositing which facilitates positive effects on sliver deposition .with minimum force<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved rotary plate for sliver depositing which prevents the sliver thrown over the edge of the sliver can during deposition as the deposition using the device of the present invention is effected in a gentle manner .<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved rotary plate for sliver depositing which helps in gentle deposition of the sliver using the device of the present invention which in turn ensures proper unwinding of the fibre sliver from the sliver can during subsequent processing in the high speed down stream machines.<br>
The above objectives have been achieved according to the present invention by modifying the constructional features of the tubular sliver channel incorporated in the can coiler . Accordingly it is proposed to have a tubular sliver channel comprising curved portions at the feed end and delivery end , an inclined spiral portion merging with both the curved portions such that the forces which exert  on the sliver as a result of the movement of the sliver in<br><br>
the channel wall will be as minimum as possible and making the angle between the planes of the curved portions and the inclined spiral portion being in the range 10 to 40 deg.<br>
Further since the sliver channel is formed from a tubular piece having two<br>
curved portions and one inclined spiral portion merging both the curved<br>
portions no straight portion is present between the curved portions of the<br>
sliver path resulting in an   acceleration force of lesser magnitude acts on the<br>
sliver.<br>
The present   invention is illustrated with reference to the figures 4 to 8 .<br>
In the drawings,<br>
Fig 4 represents the cross sectional view of the rotary plate according to the<br>
invention.<br>
Fig- 5 represents the front view of the sliver channel according to the present<br>
invention.<br>
Fig- 6 represents the top view of the sliver channel according to the present<br>
invention.<br>
Fig- 7 represents the side  view of the sliver channel according to the present<br>
invention.<br>
Fig- 8   represents  the spiral portion of the   sliver channel according to the<br>
present invention.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an improved can coiler(l) for spinning preparatory machine for depositing sliver comprising a coiler housing ( 2&amp;3 ) and a tubular sliver channel (4), the tubular sliver channel (4) which is housed within the coiler housing (2&amp;3)in such a way that the sliver passing through the tubular sliver channel is deposited gently in to the sliver can (8) kept at the bottom of the can coiler , the tubular sliver channel comprising a straight portion ( 9 ),a curved first portion (10) at the feed end formed with radius in the range of 40 to70mm (Ri) , a curved second portion (1 l)at the delivery end formed with radius in the range of 40 to 70 mm (Rd),<br><br>
an inclined spiral portion (12) merging with both the curved portions in such a way that the forces which exert on the sliver as a result of the movement of the sliver in the tubular channel wall is minimum as possible, the angle between the planes of the curved portions and the inclined spiral portion (Al) being in the range 10 to 40 deg.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention the can coiler housing comprises of two parts namely a top part (2) and a bottom part (3).<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention the top and the bottom parts are connected rigidly so as to facilitate working at higher delivery speeds.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention , the top and the bottom parts may be made out of light weight material such as aluminium alloy. According to another feature of the invention the sliver channel is housed within the top and bottom parts such that the sliver passing through the sliver channel is deposited gently in to the sliver can (8) kept at the bottom of the coiler.<br>
According to another feature of the present invention the distance (13) between the coiler (1) and the sliver can (8) may depend on the material of the sliver fibre.<br>
To minimize the wear and tear of the sliver contact area of the bottom part (3) due to the continuous contact with fibre sliver, sliver contact area of the bottom part may be treated with suitable means for enhancing the surface hardness. The means employed for this purpose may be selected from hard anodizing, hard chrome plating and electro less nickel plating.<br>
The coiler (1) consists of two major components namely coiler housing and the tubular sliver channel (4). In a preferred embodiment of the invention the<br><br>
coiler housing may be formed by two parts - one top portion (2 ) and another bottom portion (3 ). These two portions are fixed rigidly. The tubular sliver channel (4) is housed within the coiler housing (2&amp;3) in such a way that the sliver passing through the tubular sliver channel can be deposited gently in to the sliver can ( 8) kept at the bottom of the coiler (1) by revolving the coiler with respect to the rotational axis (5). The sliver enters the coiler (1) through the inlet point (6) of the tubular sliver channel (4). After passing through the tubular sliver channel (4), the sliver exit the coiler at the exit point (7) of the tubular sliver channel.<br>
The tubular sliver channel (4) is fixed with the coiler housing both at the inlet portion and out let portion with suitable synthetic components so that the sliver channel is always positioned correctly and does not change its position under out side influences. The synthetic component used may be selected from different grades of resins and hardeners. The tubular sliver channel (4) is centered in the coiler housing and the coiler rotates around the rotational axis{5) during the depositing of the fibre sliver. The rotation of the coiler about the rotational axis (5) causes the fibre sliver to be deposited in circular pattern in the sliver can (8) kept underneath the coiler . The sliver can (8) also rotates at the same time and the fibre sliver is deposited in cycloid form so that the sliver can (8) is filled in a more uniform manner and can be filled with more fibre sliver.<br>
The feed end of the sliver channel (4) which receives the sliver from the calendar zone of the machine consists of a straight portion ( 9), a first curved portion ( 10 ) and a second curved portion (11). The first curved portion having a radius in the range of 40 to 70 mm ( Ri) .The second curved portion (11) has a radius in the range of 40 to 70 mm(Rd). The inclined spiral portion(12) merges with the curved portions (10 &amp;ll),provided at the feed and deliver end of the tubular sliver channel. The inclined spiral portion merging with both the curved portions in such a way that the forces which<br><br>
exert   on the sliver as a result of the movement of the stiver in the tubular<br>
channel wall will be as minimum as possible. Since the sliver channel is<br>
formed from a tubular piece having two curved portions and one inclined<br>
spiral merging    both the curved portions , no straight portion is present<br>
between the curved portions of   the sliver path resulting in an acceleration<br>
force of lesser magnitude acts on the sliver.<br>
Advantages of the invention<br>
1. The invention facilitates guiding the sliver gently through the sliver channel<br>
of the coiler which helps in collecting it in sliver can without  affecting the<br>
sliver quality.<br>
2.The invention facilitates  smooth guidance of the sliver through  the sliver<br>
channel of the coiler.<br>
3.The invention facilitates positive effects on sliver deposition, with minimum<br>
force.<br>
4.The invention prevents   the sliver thrown over the edge of the sliver can<br>
during deposition  as the deposition using the device of the present invention<br>
is effected in a gentle manner .<br>
5.The gentle deposition of the sliver using the device of the present invention<br>
ensures proper unwinding of the fibre sliver from the sliver can during<br>
subsequent processing in the high speed down stream machines.<br>
6.The construction feature of the outlet region of the sliver channel facilitates<br>
formation of a distorted oval shape at the exit portion, which helps in smooth<br>
collection of the sliver in the sliver can.<br><br><br>
