This invention relates to a novel physical form of a dihydro-2,3-benzodiazepine derivative useful as a pharmaceutical in the treatment of disorders of the nervous system.<br>
European patent application publication number EP-Al-0492485 discloses the compound 1-(4-aminophenyl)-3-acetyl-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-3,4-dihydro-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine. The compound is a potent and selective antagonist of the excitatory amino acid AMPA receptor and is believed to have the ability to treat a variety of neurological disorders. The (R)-enantiomer of this compound hereinafter referred to as <r is the most potent enantiomer.></r>
The present invention provides a physical form of (R) -7-acetyl-5- (4-aminophenyl) -8,9.-dihydro-8-methyl-7H-l, 3-dioxolo[4,5-h][2,3]benzodiazepine having an X-ray powder diffraction pattern with d spacings at 12.78, 9.48, 8.99, 8.64, 8.23, 6.39, 6.27, 5.73, 4.01 and 3.96 A.  It also provides a process for producing this form, pharmaceutical compositions containing it and methods of using it.<br>
It has been found that (R)-7-acety1-5-(4-aminophenyl)-8,9-dihydro-8-methyl-7H-l,3-dioxolo[4,5-h][2,3]benzodiazepine is polymorphic.<br>
The first physical form of (R)-7-acetyl-5-(4-aminophenyl)-8,9-dihydro-8-methyl-7H-l,3-dioxolo[4,5-h][2,3]benzodiazepine to be found had a melting point of about 168-172OC and an X-ray powder diffraction pattern with characteristic d spacings at 6.57 and 5.24 A.  This physical form is referred to hereinafter as form I.  It has been prepared by reducing (R)-7-acetyl-8,9-dihydro-8-methyl-5-(4-nitrophenyl)-7H-1,3-dioxolo[4,5-h][2,3]benzodiazepine in ethanol using hydrogen and palladium on carbon as catalyst, then removing the catalyst by filtration, evaporating off the<br><br>
-2-<br>
ethanol, heating the residue in 5.7 volumes of 1:1 water/ethanol under reflux and then allowing the resultant solution to cool.<br>
Surprisingly, modifying the process used to prepare form I by using ammonium formate and palladium on carbon instead of hydrogen and palladium on carbon gave a new physical form of (R)-7-acetyl-5-{4-aminophenyl)-8,9-dihydro-8-methyl-7H-1,3-dioxolo[4,5-h] [2,3] benzodiazepine, hereafter referred to as form II.  Thus form II has been prepared by reducing (R)-7-acetyl-8,9-dihydro-8-methyl-5-(4-nitrophenyl)-7H-1,3-dioxolo[4,5-h][2,3]benzodiazepine in ethanol using ammonium formate and palladium on carbon as catalyst, then removing the catalyst by filtration, evaporating off the ethanol, heating the residue in 6 volumes of 1:1 water/ethanol under reflux, and allowing the resultant solution to cool.  Form II has been found to have an X-ray powder diffraction pattern with characteristic d spacings at 13 .12 and 5.01 A.<br>
Modifying the process used to prepare form II by using potassium formate and palladium on carbon instead of ammonium formate and palladium on carbon surprisingly gave yet another physical form, referred to hereinafter as form III.  Thus form III has been prepared by reducing (R)-7-acetyl-8,9-dihydro-8-methyl-5-{4-nitrophenyl)-7H-1,3-dioxolo[4,5-h][2,3]benzodiazepine in ethanol using potassium formate and palladium on carbon as catalyst, then removing the catalyst by filtration, evaporating off the ethanol, heating the residue in 6 volumes of 1:1 water/ethanol under reflux and allowing the resultant solution to cool.  Form III has been found to have an X-ray powder diffraction pattern with characteristic d spacings at 10.61, 8.83, 6.78, 5.83, 4.13 and 3.74 A.  This physical form is the subject of a co-pending patent application (ref. X9386C).<br>
Surprisingly, yet another physical form, hereinafter referred to as form IV has also been found.  This form was initially observed to have been formed after form II had been heated.  It was subsequently found that form IV may be prepared directly by modifying the process used to prepare<br><br>
-3-<br>
form III, in particular by increasing the volume ratio of water/ethanol used in the crystallization step.  Thus form IV has been prepared by reducing (R)-7-acetyl-8,9-dihydro-8-methyl-5-(4-nitrophenyl)-7H-1,3-dioxolo[4,5-h][2,3] -benzodiazepine in ethanol using potassium formate and palladium in carbon as catalyst, then removing the catalyst by filtration, evaporating off the ethanol, heating the residue in 8 volumes of 5:3 water/ethanol or 7 volumes of 4:3 water/ethanol under reflux, optionally seeding with Form IV crystals at 70-80' and allowing the resultant mixture to cool.  Form IV has been found to have an X-ray powder diffraction pattern with characteristic d spacings at 12.78, 9.48, 8.99, 8.64, 8.23, 6.39, 6.27, 5.73, 4.01 and 3.96 A. This physical form is provided as one aspect of the invention.<br>
Form I has been found to possess several<br>
disadvantageous properties.  In particular, it has been found to crystallize out as a thick slurry which is difficult to stir and transfer.  The filtration time has been found to be unacceptably long for large scale production, and the drying time for filtered wet cake is also long.  Furthermore, Form I has been found to be thermally unstable, and has been found to convert to form IV or, occassionally, yet another physical form hereinafter referred to as form V.  Form V has been found to have an X-ray powder diffraction pattern with characteristic d spacings at 6.12, 5.94 and 5.48 A.  Form V shows multiple phase transitions when subject to differential scanning calorimetry.<br>
Form II has been found to crystallize out as a stirrable suspension which can readily be filtered.  However, it has been found to dry slowly and to retain crystallization solvent.  Like Form I, it has been found to be thermally unstable with regard to conversion to form IV.<br>
Form III has been found to crystallize out as a stirrable suspension which can readily be filtered and dried. It has also been found to be thermally stable.<br><br>
-4-<br>
Form IV has also been found to crystallize out as a stirrable suspension which can readily be filtered and dried. Like Form III, it has also been found to be thermally stable.<br>
Each of Forms I, II, III, IV and V has been<br>
characterized by a X-ray diffraction, by 13C solid state NMR spectroscopy and by differential scanning calorimetry.  The techniques used, and the physical characteristics determined for samples of each form are given below, together (for forms III and IV only) with general ranges obtained by differential scanning calorimetry using a number of different samples.<br>
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on a Siemens. D5000 X-ray diffractometer, equipped with a Cu Ka ( =1.54056A) source operating at a tube load of 50KV and<br>
40mA.  Data was collected with a Kevex solid-state detector. Each sample was scanned between 4 and 35' 20 with a step size<br>
of 0.03* and a maximum scan rate of 2 sec/step.<br>
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)<br>
measurements were performed on a Seiko differential scanning calorimeter.  Samples (2-5mg) sealed in aluminum pans were heated from ambient (25oC to at least 200oC at a rate of 10oC/min.<br>
l3C Cross polarization/magic angle spinning<br>
(CP/MAS) NMR spectra were obtained using a Varian Unity 400 MHz spectrometer operating at a carbon frequency of 100.577 MHZ and equipped with a complete solids accessory and Varian 5 or 7 mm VT CP/MAS probe.  Typical measurement conditions were as follows:  90(deg) proton r.f. pulse 5.0 ms, contact time 1-2 ms, pulse repetition time 5s, MAS frequency 7 kHz, spectral width 50 kHz, and acquisition time 50 ms.  The chemical shifts were referenced to the CH3 group of hexamethylbenzene (delta =17.3 ppm) by sample replacement.<br><br>

According to another aspect,the present invention provides a process for the preparation of Form IV, which comprises<br>
a)  reacting a compound of formula<br><br>
in which Ms is methanesulfonyl, R is methyl, X is acetyl and Aryl is p-nitrophenyl with caustic soda to afford a compound of formula I<br><br>
-9-<br><br>
in which R is methyl, X is acetyl and Aryl is p-nitrophenyl;<br>
b)	reducing the p-nitrophenyl group in the formula<br>

presence of palladium or charcoal as catalyst to afford a<br>
compound of formula I in which Aryl is p-aminophenyl; and<br>
c)	crystallizing the compound of formula I in which<br>
Aryl is p-aminophenyl from a mixture of water and ethanol in<br>
which the number of volumes of water per volume of ethanol is<br>
at least 1.1/1.0.<br>
Step (a) of the process is conveniently performed at a temperature in the range of from 0 to 100'C.  Suitable solvents include alkanols such as methanol or ethanol, and ethers such as tetrahydrofuran.<br>
In Step (c), the number of volume of water per volume of ethanol is preferably in the range of from 1.15 to 2.0, more preferably from 1.2 to 1.8 volumes.<br>
The compound of general formula VII may be prepared by a multistep process, starting from a methylenedioxyphenyl ketone derivative.  This process comprises:<br><br>
-10-<br>
a)   providing a quantity of a compound having the formula:<br><br>
in which R is methyl;<br>
b)   asymmetrically reducing the compound of formula II to yield a compound having the formula:<br><br>
c)   reacting the compound of formula III with p-nitrobenzaldehyde compound of formula Aryl.CHO to yield an isochroman compound having the formula:<br><br>

-11-<br><br>
e)   reacting the compound of formula V with acetic hydrazide to yield a compound of the formula:<br><br>
f)   reacting the compound of formula VI with methanesulfonyl chloride and a tertiary amine, to form a compound of formula VII.<br>
The preferred process involves the early chiral reduction of a ketone to an alcohol.  Substituents are added in a multi-step process to close the benzo-fused pyran ring, before a hydrazine reagent is introduced to open the ring and add the necessary nitrogen components.  Finally, the secondary ring is closed by addition of a strong base and the compound is reduced  to form the desired compound.<br>
Most preferably, the chiral reduction step is the initial step in the synthesis of the Formula (I) compounds from ketones.  The chiral reduction may be effected by use of specific chemicals or, preferably, by using biological agents as disclosed below.  Setting the stereochemistry early in the process is beneficial and allows for the later steps to be carried out on relatively enantiomerically pure material. This increases both throughput and enantiomeric purity.<br><br>
-12-<br>
The first step of the process involves a chiral reduction of 3,4- methylenedioxyphenyl acetone to produce a virtually enantiomerically pure alcohol derivative of 1,2-methylenedioxybenzene.  Preferably, the enantiomer formed is the S or (+) stereoisomer of the alcohol.<br>
Alternatively, the initial step may involve the combination of a halo derivative of 1,2-methylenedioxybenzene with an enantiomerically enriched epoxide.  This also results in the production of a highly enantiomerically enriched alcohol derivative of 1,2-methylenedioxybenzene.<br>
The material used to effect the chiral reduction initial step may be either chemical or preferably biological. In the case of biological agents, the preferred agents are reducing enzymes, most preferred being yeasts from the Zygosaccharomyces group.  Other biological agents which may be used include:  Pichia fermentans, Endomycopsis fibuligera, Nematospora coryli, Saccharomyces sp., Candida famata, Saccharomyces pastorianus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces uvarum, Candida utilis, Saccharomyces globosus, Kluyveromyces dobzhansk, Kluyveromyces lactis, Candida albicans, bakers ' yeast, Zygosaccharomyces rouxii, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Aureobasidium pullulans, Mortierella isabellina, Rhizopus oryzae, Kloeckeva javanica, Hanseniaspora valbyensis, Octosporomyces octospori, Candida guilliermondi, Candida parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis, Torulopsis taboadae, Torulopsis ethanolitolerans, Toruiopsis ptarmiganii, Torulopsis sonorensis, Trigonopsis variabilis, Torulopsis enokii, Torulopsis methanothermo, SAF instant yeast, ashland yeast inact., Candida boidinii, Candida blankii and Red Star yeast.<br>
The desired intermediate formed in the initial step is an alcohol substituted congener of 1,2-methylenedioxybenzene, with the most preferred congener consisting of (S)- -Methyl-1,3-benzodioxole-5-ethanol.<br>
The desired intermediate compound formed in the initial step is then subjected to a Pictet-Spengler reaction which provides for convergent fusion of the benzodiazepine<br><br>
-13<br>
carbon constituents.  The preferred reagent of choice is p-nitrobenzaldehyde, although other reagents known to those skilled in the art such as acetals may be used.  The preferred intermediates are dihydrobenzopyrans with the most preferred compound being 7,8-dihydro-7-methyl-5-(4-nitrophenyl)-5H-1,3-dioxolo-benzo[b]pyran.<br>
The dihydrobenzopyran congener is then oxidized at the C5 position to yield a hemiketal derivative of the general formula<br><br>
The preferred oxidizing agents include potassium permanganate, DDQ (2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-l,4-benzoquinone) or others, with the most preferred agent being a sodium hydroxide and air combination.<br><br>
wherein R is CH3, X is acetyl and Aryl is p-nitrophenyl.<br>
The C5-hemiketal is then reacted with acetic hydrazide in the presence of acid in order to form the hydrazone intermediate.  In this step, the benzopyran ring is opened such that the hydrazone component is attached to the C5 carbon.  The reaction is conveniently performed in a refluxing aromatic or protic solvent, with the preferred hydrazone being of the general formula<br><br><br><br>
-14-<br><br><br>
The process can be summarized by the following<br>
Schemes.<br>
In scheme (I), the initial step of the process involves the addition of biological agents, most preferably Zygosaccharomyces rouxii, to reduce the ketone to the desired alcohol.  A suitable quantity of an adsorbent resin such as AD-7, XAD-7, HP2MGL (cross-linked polymethacrylates from Rohm &amp; Haas), HP20 (polystyrenic), or SP207 (brominated polystyrene from Mitsubishi) may be added to the reaction mixture to prevent death of the organism and to adsorb the alcohol as it is formed.  Other similar resins may also be used.<br><br>
-15-<br><br>
In scheme (II), the initial step of the process involves reacting an aryl halide derivative, such as 4-bromo-1,2 (methylenedioxy) benzene, with an alkali metal hydrocarbon (sec-butyllithium is preferred) and an enantiomerically pure epoxide.  Alternatively, an aryl halide may first be converted into a Grignard reagent by reaction with magnesium, then reacted with an enantiomerically pure epoxide in the presence of Copper (I) iodide as catalyst. Preferred is (S) - (-)-propylene oxide.  In both scheme (I) and scheme (II), the objective is to set the stereochemistry of the C8 atom of the benzodiazepine ring as early as possible.  Both schemes have been observed to accomplish this objective and have formed enantiomerically enriched (ee) alcohols in the 98% purity range.<br>
(R)-7-acetyl-5-(4-aminophenyl)-8,9-dihydro-8-methyl-7H-l,3-dioxolo[4,5-h][2,3]benzodiazepine is known to be a selective antagonist for the AMPA receptor.  According to yet another aspect, therefore, the present invention provides the use of form IV for the manufacture a medicament for blocking AMPA receptors in a mammal requiring such treatment.<br>
A variety of physiological functions have been shown to be subject to influence by excessive or inappropriate stimulation of excitatory amino acid neurotransmission.  (R)-7-Acetyl-5-(4-aminophenyl)-8,9-dihydro-8-methyl-7H-1,3-dioxolo[4,5-h][2,3]benzodiazepine is believed to have the ability to treat a variety of neurological disorders in mammals associated with this condition which include acute neurological disorders such as cerebral deficits subsequent to cardiac bypass surgery and<br><br>
-16-<br>
grafting, stroke, cerebral ischemia, spinal cord trauma, head trauma, perinatal hypoxia, cardiac arrest and hypoglycemic neuronal damage.  The compound is believed to have the ability to treat a variety of chronic neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease, Huntington's Chorea, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, AlDS-induced dementia, ocular damage and retinopathy, and idiopathic and drug-induced Parkinson's Disease.

The compound is also believed to have the ability to treat a variety of other neurological disorders in mammals that are associated with glutamate dysfunction including muscular spasms, convulsions, migraine headaches, urinary incontinence, psychosis, drug tolerance and withdrawal, anxiety, emesis, brain edema, chronic pain, and tardive dyskinesia.  The compound is also useful as an analgesic agent.  Therefore, the present invention also provides the use of form IV for the manufacture of a medicament for treating these disorders.<br>
The term "effective amount" is used herein to represent an amount of form IV which is capable of blocking the AMPA excitatory amino acid receptor.  The particular dose of compound administered according to this invention will of course be determined by the particular circumstances surrounding the case,  including the compound administered, the route of administration, the particular condition being treated, and similar considerations.  The form can be administered by a variety of routes including the oral, rectal, transdermal, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, or intranasal routes.  Alternatively, the form may be administered by continuous infusion.  A typical daily dose will contain from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 30 mg/kg of the active compound of this invention.  Preferred daily doses will be about 0.05 mg/kg to about 24 mg/kg, more preferably about 0.1 to about 20 mg/kg.<br><br>
-17-<br>
Form IV will generally be administered in a<br>
pharmaceutical composition.  According to another aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition, which comprises form IV and a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier.<br>
In making the compositions of the present<br>
invention, the active ingredient will usually be mixed with a carrier, or diluted by a carrier, or enclosed within a carrier which may be in the form of a capsule, sachet, paper, or other container.  When the carrier serves as a diluent, it may be a solid, semi-solid, or liquid material which acts as a vehicle, excipient, or medium for the active ingredient. The compositions can be in the form of, for example, tablets, pills, powders, lozenges, sachets, cachets, suspensions, aerosols, soft and hard gelatin capsules and sterile packaged powders.<br>
Some examples of suitable carriers, excipients, and diluents include lactose, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol, mannitol, starches, gum, acacia, calcium phosphate, alginates, tragacanth, gelatin, calcium silicate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, cellulose, methyl cellulose, methyl and propyl hydroxybenzoates, talc, magnesium sterate and mineral oil.  The formulations can additionally include lubricating agents, wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, preserving agents, sweetening agents, or flavoring agents.  Compositions of the inventions may be formulated so as to provide quick, sustained, or delayed release of the active ingredient after administration to the patient by employing procedures well known in the art.<br>
The compositions are preferably formulated in a unit dosage form, each dosage containing from about 5 to about 5000 mg, more preferably about 25 to about 3000 mg of the active ingredient.  The most preferred unit dosage form contains about 100 to about 2 000 mg of the active ingredient. The term "unit dosage form" refers to a physically discrete unit suitable as unitary dosages for human subjects and other<br><br>
-18-<br>
mammals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with a suitable pharmaceutical carrier.<br>
The following examples illustrate the invention.<br><br>
-19-<br>
Example  1<br>
Synthesis of (S)- -methyl-1,3 benzodioxole-5-ethanol<br>
1 equiv. of 3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl acetone, 0.45 equiv. disodium phosphate, 0.03 equiv. phosphoric acid, 12.5 volumes AD-7 resin and 5.8 volumes of water were mixed together and stirred for 15-60 minutes at 20-25°C.  2.27 equiv. of glucose were added and Z. rouxii ATCC 14462 is added in an amount of 1.5 grams wet cell paste per gram of ketone {this is 0.375 grams/gram on a dry basis).  This mixture was diluted with water to 25 volumes and then gently stirred at 33-35°C for 8-16 hours.  The mixture was filtered on a 100 mesh (~150 micron) stainless steel screen, and the resin which was retained by the screen was washed with 25 volumes of water split into 4 separate portions.
