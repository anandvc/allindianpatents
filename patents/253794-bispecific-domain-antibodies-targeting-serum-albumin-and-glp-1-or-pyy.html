BISPECIFIC DOMAIN ANTIBODIES TARGETING SERUM ALBUMIN AND GLP-1 OR PYY<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No.<br>
60/632,361, filed on December 2, 2004 and the benefit of GB Patent Application No.<br>
0511019.2. The entire teachings of the above applications are incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Many drugs that possess activities that could be useful for therapeutic and/or<br>
diagnostic purposes have limited value because they are rapidly eliminated from the<br>
body when administered. For example, many polypeptides that have therapeutically<br>
useful activities are rapidly cleared from the circulation via the kidney. Accordingly, a<br>
large dose must be administered in order to achieve a desired therapeutic effect. A need<br>
exists for improved therapeutic and diagnostic agents that have improved<br>
pharmacokinetic properties. Polypeptides that bind serum albumin are known in the art.<br>
(See, e.g., EP 0486525 Bl (Cemu Bioteknik AB); US 6,267,964 Bl (Nygren et al);<br>
WO 04/001064 A2 (Dyax, Corp.); WO 02/076489 Al(Dyax, Corp.); WO 01/45746<br>
(Genentech, Inc.).)<br>
One such class of drugs that have a short half life in the body or systemic<br>
circulation is the incretin hormones such as Glucagon-like peptide 1, or Peptide YY.<br>
Glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-l is an incretin hormone with potent glucose-<br>
dependent insulinotropic and glucagonostatic actions, trophic effects on the pancreatic Î²<br>
cells, and inhibitory effects on gastrointestinal secretion and motility, which combine to<br>
lower plasma glucose and reduce glycemic excursions. Furthermore, via its ability to<br>
enhance satiety, GLP-1 reduces food intake, thereby limiting weight gain, and may even<br>
cause weight loss. Taken together, these actions give GLP-1 a unique profile,<br>
considered highly desirable for an antidiabetic agent, particularly since the glucose<br>
dependency of its antihyperglycemic effects should minimize any risk of severe<br>
hypoglycemia. However, its pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile is such that<br>
native GLP-1 is not therapeutically useful. Thus, while GLP-1 is most effective when<br><br>
WO 2006/059106	PCT/GB2005/004599<br>
-2-<br>
administered continuously, single subcutaneous injections have short-lasting effects.<br>
GLP-1 is highly susceptible to enzymatic degradation in vivo, and cleavage by<br>
dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) is probably the most relevant, since this occurs<br>
rapidly and generates a noninsulinotropic metabolite. Strategies for harnessing GLP-1 's<br>
therapeutic potential, based on an understanding of factors influencing its metabolic<br>
stability and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile, have therefore been the focus<br>
of intense research.<br>
Extensive work has been done to attempt to inhibit the peptidase or to modify<br>
GLP-1 in such a way that its degradation is slowed down while still maintaining<br>
biological activity. WO05/027978 discloses GLP-1 derivatives having a protracted<br>
profile of action (and incorporated herein by reference as examples of GLP-1<br>
derivatives and analogues that can be used in the present invention). WO 02/46227<br>
discloses heterologous fusion proteins comprising a polypeptide (for example, albumin)<br>
fused to GLP-1 or analogues (the disclosure of these analogues is incorporated herein<br>
by reference as examples of GLP-1 analogues that can be used in the present invention).<br>
WO05/003296, WO03/060071, WO03/059934 disclose amino fusion protein wherein<br>
GLP-1 has fused with albumin to attempt to increase the half-life of the hormone.<br>
However, despite these efforts a long lasting active GLP-1 has not been<br>
produced.<br>
As such, particularly in the fields of diabetes and obesity, there is a tremendous<br>
need for improved GLP-1 peptides or other agents that similarly have an insulinotropic<br>
effect amenable to treatment for diabetes and obesity in particular. There is thus a need<br>
to modify GLP-1 and other insulinotropic peptides to provide longer duration of action<br>
in vivo while maintaining their low toxicity and therapeutic advantages.<br>

concentration was determined by ELISA using goat anti-HA (Abeam, UK) capture and<br>
protein L-HRP (Invitrogen, USA) detection reagents. Standard curves of known<br>
concentrations of MSA binding dAb/HA fusion were set up in the presence of lx mouse<br>
serum to ensure comparability with the test samples. Modelling with a 1 compartment<br>
model (WinNonlin Software, Pharsight Corp., USA) showed the MSA binding dAb/HA<br>

ID NO:49), DOM7r-28 (SEQ ID NO:50), DOM7r-29 (SEQ ID NO.51), DOM7r-30<br>
(SEQ ID NO:52), DOM7r-31 (SEQ ID NO:53), DOM7r-32 (SEQ ID NO:54), DOM7r-<br>
33 (SEQ ID NO:55).<br>
FIG. 12 is a graph showing the concentration (% initial dose) of DOM7m-16,<br>
DOM7m-26 or a control dAb that does not bind MSA, each of which contained an HA<br>
epitope tag, in mouse serum following a single intravenous (i.v.) injection (dose was<br>
about 1.5 mg/kg) into CD1 strain male animals over time. Serum concentration was<br>
determined by ELISA using goat anti-HA (Abeam, UK) capture and protein L-HRP<br>
(Invitrogen, USA) detection reagents. Standard curves of known concentrations of<br>
MSA binding dAb/HA fusion were set up in the presence of lx mouse serum to ensure<br>
comparability with the test samples. Modelling with a 1 compartment model<br>
(WinNonlin Software, Pharsight Corp., USA) showed control dAb had a terminal phase<br>
tl/2o! of 20 minutes, while DOM7m-16, DOM7m-26 persisted in serum significantly<br>
longer.<br>
FIG. 13 is a graph showing that DOM7m-16/IL-lra was more effective than IL-<br>
lra or ENBRELÂ® (entarecept; Immunex Corporation) in treating arthritis in a mouse<br>
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model. Arthritis was induced and, beginning on day<br>
21, mice were treated with Dexamethasone at 0.4 mg/Kg (Steroid), DOM7m-16/IL-lra<br>
at 1 mg/Kg (IL-lra/anti-SA lmg/kg) or 10 mg/Kg (IL-lra/anti-SA 10 mg/kg), IL-lra at<br>
1 mg/Kg or 10 mg/Kg, ENBRELÂ® (entarecept; Immunex Corporation) at 5 mg/Kg, or<br>
saline. The results show that DOM7m-16/IL-lra was more effective than IL-lra or<br>
ENBRELÂ® (entarecept; Immunex Corporation) in this study. The response to EL-Ira<br>

dose dependent. The average scores for treatment with DOM7m-16/IL-lra at 1 mg/Kg<br>
were consistently lower than the average scores obtained by treatment with IL-lra at 10<br>
mg/kg. The results indicate that treatment with DOM7m-16/IL-lra was 10 times more<br>
effective than IL-lra in this study.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Within this specification embodiments have been described in a way which<br>
enables a clear and concise specification to be written, but it is intended and will be<br>
appreciated that embodiments may be variously combined or separated without parting<br>
from the invention.<br>
As used herein, "drug" refers to any compound (e.g., small organic molecule,<br>
nucleic acid, polypeptide) that can be administered to an individual to produce a<br>
beneficial therapeutic or diagnostic effect though binding to and/or altering the function<br>
of a biological target molecule in the individual. The target molecule can be an<br>
endogenous target molecule encoded by the individual's genome (e.g., an enzyme,<br>
receptor, growth factor, cytokine encoded by the individual's genome) or an exogenous<br>
target molecule encoded by the genome of a pathogen (e.g., an enzyme encoded by the<br>
genome of a virus, bacterium, fungus, nematode or other pathogen).<br>
As used herein the term "drug basis" refers to activities of drug compositions<br>
and drugs that are normalized based on the amount of drug (or drug moiety) used to<br>
assess, measure or determine activity. Generally, the drug compositions of the<br>
invention (e.g., drug conjugate, noncovalent drug conjugate, drug fusion) have a larger<br>
molecular weight than the drug they contain. Thus, equivalent amounts of drug<br>
composition and drug, by weight, will contain different amounts of drug on a molecular<br>
or molar basis. For example, if a drug composition of the invention has a molecular<br>
weight that is twice the molecular weight of the drug it comprises, activities can be<br>
determined on a "drug basis" using 2 Î¼g of drug composition and 1 jug of drug, because<br><br>
WO 2006/059106	PCT/GB2005/004599<br>
-11-<br>
these quantities would contain the same amount of drug (as free drug or as part of the<br>
drug composition). Activities can be normalized and expressed on a "drug basis" using<br>
appropriate calculations, for example, by expressing activity on a per target binding site<br>
basis or, for enzyme drugs, on a per active site basis.<br>
As used herein, "drug composition" refers to a composition comprising a drug<br>
that is covalently or noncovalently bonded to a polypeptide binding moiety, wherein the<br>
polypeptide binding moiety contains a binding site (e.g., an antigen-binding site) that<br>
has binding specificity for a polypeptide that enhances serum half-life in vivo. The drug<br>
composition can be a conjugate wherein the drug is covalently or noncovalently bonded<br>
to the polypeptide binding moiety. The drag can be covalently or noncovalently bonded<br>
to the polypeptide binding moiety directly or indirectly (e.g., through a suitable linker<br>
and/or noncovalent binding of complementary binding partners (e.g., biotin and<br>
avidin)). When complementary binding partners are employed, one of the binding<br>
partners can be covalently bonded to the drag directly or through a suitable linker<br>
moiety, and the complementary binding partner can be covalently bonded to the<br>
polypeptide binding moiety directly or through a suitable linker moiety. When the drug<br>
is a polypeptide or peptide, the drug composition can be a fusion protein, wherein the<br>
polypeptide or peptide drug and the polypeptide binding moiety are discrete parts<br>
(moieties) of a continuous polypeptide chain.<br>
As used herein "conjugate" refers to a composition comprising an antigen-<br>
binding fragment of an antibody that binds serum albumin that is bonded to a drag.<br>
Such conjugates include "drag conjugates," which comprise an antigen-binding<br>
fragment of an antibody that binds serum albumin to which a drag is covalently bonded,<br>
and "noncovlaent drag conjugates," which comprise an antigen-binding fragment of an<br>
antibody that binds serum albumin to which a drag is noncovalently bonded.<br>
As used herein, "drug conjugate" refers to a composition comprising an antigen-<br>
binding fragment of an antibody that binds serum albumin to which a drug is covalently<br>
bonded. The drag can be covalently bonded to the antigen-binding fragment directly or<br>
indirectly through a suitable linker moiety. The drag can be bonded to the antigen-<br>
binding fragment at any suitable position, such as the amino-terminus, the carboxyl-<br>
terminus or through suitable amino acid side chains (e.g., the e amino group of lysine, or<br>
thiol group of cysteine).<br><br>
WO 2006/059106	PCT/GB2005/004599<br>
-12-<br>
As used herein, "noncovalent drug conjugate" refers to a composition<br>
comprising an antigen-binding fragment of an antibody that binds serum albumin to<br>
which a drug is noncovalently bonded. The drug can be noncovalently bonded to the<br>
antigen-binding fragment directly (e.g., electrostatic interaction, hydrophobic<br>
interaction) or indirectly (e.g., through noncovalent binding of complementary binding<br>
partners (e.g., biotin and avidin), wherein one partner is covalently bonded to drug and<br>
the complementary binding partner is covalently bonded to the antigen-binding<br>
fragment). When complementary binding partners are employed, one of the binding<br>
partners can be covalently bonded to the drug directly or through a suitable linker<br>
moiety, and the complementary binding partner can be covalently bonded to the<br>
antigen-binding fragment of an antibody that binds serum albumin directly or through a<br>
suitable linker moiety.<br>
As used herein, "drug fusion" refers to a fusion protein that comprises an<br>
antigen-binding fragment of an antibody that binds serum albumin and a polypeptide<br>
drug. The antigen-binding fragment of an antibody that binds serum albumin and the<br>
polypeptide drug are present as discrete parts (moieties) of a single continuous<br>
polypeptide chain.<br>
The term "albumin binding residue" as used herein means a residue which binds<br>
non-covalently to human serum albumin. The albumin binding residue attached to the<br>
therapeutic polypeptide typically has an affinity below 10 uM to human serum albumin<br>
and preferably below 1 pM. In on embodiment, a range of albumin binding residues are<br>
known among linear and branched lipohophillic moieties containing 4-40 carbon atoms,<br>
compounds with a cyclopentanophenanthrene skeleton, peptides having 10-30 amino<br>
acid residues etc.<br>
As used herein "interleukin 1 receptor antagonist" (IL-lra) refers to<br>
naturally occurring or endogenous mammalian IL-lra proteins and to proteins having an<br>
amino acid sequence which is the same as that of a naturally occurring or endogenous<br>
corresponding mammalian EL-lra protein (e.g., recombinant proteins, synthetic proteins<br>
(i.e., produced using the methods of synthetic organic chemistry)). Accordingly, as<br>
defined herein, the term includes mature protein, polymorphic or allelic variants, and<br>
other isoforms of a IL-lra (e.g., produced by alternative splicing or other cellular<br>
processes), and modified or unmodified forms of the foregoing (e.g., lipidated,<br><br>
WO 2006/059106	PCT/GB2005/004599<br>
-13-<br>
glycosylated, PEGylated). Naturally occurring or endogenous IL-lra include wild type<br>
proteins such as mature IL-lra, polymorphic or allelic variants and other isoforms<br>
which occur naturally in mammals (e.g., humans, non-human primates). Such proteins<br>
can be recovered or isolated from a source which naturally produces IL-lra, for<br>
example. These proteins and IL-lra proteins having the same amino acid sequence as a<br>
naturally occurring or endogenous corresponding IL-lra, are referred to by the name of<br>
the corresponding mammal. For example, where the corresponding mammal is a<br>
human, the protein is designated as a human IL-lra.<br>
"Functional variants" of IL-lra include functional fragments, functional<br>
mutant proteins, and/or functional fusion proteins which can be produce using suitable<br>
methods (e.g., mutagenesis (e.g., chemical mutagenesis, radiation mutagenesis),<br>
recombinant DNA techniques). A "functional variant" antagonizes interleukin-1 type 1<br>
receptor. Generally, fragments or portions of IL-lra include those having a deletion<br>
and/or addition (i.e., one or more amino acid deletions and/or additions) of an amino<br>
acid (i.e., one or more amino acids) relative to the mature IL-lra (such as N-terminal, C-<br>
terminal or internal deletions). Fragments or portions in which only contiguous amino<br>
acids have been deleted or in which non-contiguous amino acids have been deleted<br>
relative to mature IL-lra are also envisioned. A functional variant of human IL-lra can<br>
have at least about 80%, or at least about 85%, or at least about 90%, or at least about<br>
95%, or at least about 96%, or at least about 97%, or at least about 98%, or at least<br>
about 99% amino acid sequence identity with the mature 152 amino acid form of human<br>
IL-lra and antagonize human Interleukin-1 type 1 receptor. (See, Eisenberg et ah,<br>
Nature 343:341-346 1990). The variant can comprise one or more additional amino<br>
acids (e.g., comprise 153 or 154 or more amino acids). For example, the variant IL-lra<br>
can have an amino acid sequence that consists of an amiiio-termmal methionine residue<br>
followed by residues 26 to 177 of SEQ ID NO:33. (KINERETÂ® (anakinra), Amgen).<br>
As referred to herein, the term "about" is optional, but is preferably interpreted<br>
to mean plus or minus 20%, more preferably plus or minus 10%, even more preferably<br>
plus or minus 5%, even more preferably plus or minus 2%, most preferably plus or<br>
minus 1%.<br>
The term "analogue" as used herein referring to a polypeptide means a modified<br>
peptide wherein one or more amino acid residues of the peptide have been substituted<br><br>
WO 2006/059106	PCT/GB2005/004599<br>
-14-<br>
by other amino acid residues and/or wherein one or more amino acid residues have been<br>
deleted from the peptide and/or wherein one or more amino acid residues have been<br>
deleted from the peptide and or wherein one or more amino acid residues have been<br>
added to the peptide. Such addition or deletion of amino acid residues can take place at<br>
the N-terminal of the peptide and/or at the C-terminal of the peptide or they can be<br>
within the peptide. A simple system is used to describe analogues of GLP-1: For<br>
example [Arg34] GLP-1 (7-37) Lys designates a GLP-1 analogue wherein the naturally<br>
occurring lysine at position 34 has been substituted with arginine and a lysine residue<br>
has been added to the C-terminal (position 38). Formulae of peptide analogs and<br>
derivatives thereof are drawn using standard single letter abbreviation for amino acids<br>
used according to IUPAC-IUB nomenclature.<br>
The term "GLP-1 peptide" as used herein means GLP-1 (7-37) (SEQ ID No.<br>
158) or GLP-1 (7-36) (SEQ ID No. 159), a GLP-1 analogue, a GLP-1 derivative or a<br>
derivative of a GLP-1 analogue. Such peptides, analogues and derivatives are<br>
insulinotropic agents.<br>
The term "insulinotropic agent" as used herein means a compound which is able<br>
to stimulate, or cause the stimulation of, the synthesis or expression of, or the activity of<br>
the hormone insulin. Known examples of insulinotropic agents include but are not<br>
limited to glucose, GIP, GLP, Exendin, and OXM.<br>
The term "incretin" as used herein means a type of gastrointestinal hormone that<br>
causes an increase in the amount of insulin released when glucose levels are normal or<br>
particularly when they are elevated. By way of example they include GLP-1, GIP, and<br>
OXM.<br>
The term "exendin-4 peptide" as used herein means exendin-4 (1-39), an<br>
exendin-4 analogue, an exendin-4 derivative or a derivative of an exendin-4 analogue.<br>
In one embodiment the exendin-4 peptide is an insulinotropic agent. Such peptides,<br>
analogues and derivatives are insulinotropic agents.<br>
The term "DPP-IV protected" as used herein referring to a polypeptide means a<br>
polypeptide which has been modified (eg, chemically modified) in order to render said<br>
compound resistant to the plasma peptidase dipeptidyl aminopeptidase-4 (DPP-IV). The<br>
DPP-IV enzyme in plasma is known to be involved in the degradation of several peptide<br>
hormones, e. g. GLP-1, GLP-2, etc. Thus, a considerable effort is being made to<br><br>
WO 2006/059106	PCT/GB2005/004599<br>
- 15-<br>
develop analogues and derivatives of the polypeptides susceptible to DPP-IV mediated<br>
hydrolysis in order to reduce the rate and/or extent of degradation by DPP-IV.<br>
As used herein "saporin" refers to a family of single-chain ribosome-<br>
inactivating polypeptides produced by the plant Saponaria officinalis. (Stirpe, F., et al.,<br>
Biochem. J. 216:617-625 (1983), Bagga, S. et al., J. Biol. Chem. 278:4813-4820<br>
(2003).) Saporin polypeptides exist is several forms that differ in length and/or amino<br>
acid sequence. (See, e.g., Id. and Barthelemy, I. et al., J. Biol. Chem. 268:6541-6548<br>
(1993).) Saporin-6 is the most active form of saporin. (Bagga, S. et al., J. Biol. Chem.<br>
278:4813-4820 (2003).) At least four naturally occurring isoforms of saporin-6 in<br>
which the amino acid at position 48 of the mature polypeptide (SEQ ID NO:65) is Asp<br>
or Glu, and the amino acid a position 91 of the mature polypeptide (SEQ ID NO:65) is<br>
Arg of Lys have been described. (Barthelemy, I. et al., J. Biol. Chem. 268:6541-6548<br>
(1993).) Additional forms of saporin-6 include polypeptide in which the amino acid at<br>
position 99 of the mature polypeptide (SEQ ID NO:65) is Ser of Leu, the amino acid at<br>
position 134 of the mature polypeptide (SEQ ID NO:65) is Gin or Lys, the amino acid<br>
at position 147 of the mature polypeptide (SEQ ID NO:65) is Ser or Leu, the amino acid<br>
at position 149 of the mature polypeptide (SEQ ID NO:65) is Ser or Phe, the amino acid<br>
at position 162 of the mature polypeptide (SEQ ID NO:65) is Asp or Asn, the amino<br>
acid at position 177 of the mature polypeptide (SEQ ID NO:65) is Ala or Val, the amino<br>
acid at position 188 of the mature polypeptide (SEQ ID NO:65) is He or Thr, the amino<br>
acid at position 196 of the mature polypeptide (SEQ ID NO:65) is Asn or Asp, the<br>
amino acid at position 198 of the mature polypeptide (SEQ ID NO:65) is Glu or Asp,<br>
the amino acid at position 231 of the mature polypeptide (SEQ ID NO:65) is Asn or Ser,<br>
and polypeptides in which the amino acid at position 233 of the mature polypeptide<br>
(SEQ ID NO:65) is Lys or Arg. (Id.) A consensus sequence encompassing these<br>
isoforms and variants is presented in FIG. 14G (SEQ ID NO:67).<br>
Accordingly, the term "saporin" includes precursor protein, mature polypeptide,<br>
native protein, polymorphic or allelic variants, and other isoforms (e.g., produced by<br>
alternative splicing or other cellular processes), and modified or unmodified forms of<br>
the foregoing (e.g., lipidated, glycosylated, PEGylated). Naturally occurring or<br>
endogenous saporin include wild type proteins such as mature saporin (e.g., mature<br>
saporin-6), polymorphic or allelic variants and other isoforms which occur naturally in<br><br>
WO 2006/059106	PCT/GB2005/004599<br>
-16-<br>
Saponaria officinalis. Such proteins can be recovered or isolated from Saponaria<br>
officinalis using any suitable methods. "Functional variants" of saporin include<br>
functional fragments, functional mutant proteins, and/or functional fusion proteins<br>
which can be produce using suitable methods (e.g., mutagenesis (e.g., chemical<br>
mutagenesis, radiation mutagenesis), recombinant DNA techniques). Generally,<br>
fragments or portions of saporin (e.g., saporin-6) include those having a deletion and/or<br>
addition (i.e., one or more amino acid deletions and/or additions) of an amino acid (i.e.,<br>
one or more amino acids) relative to mature saporin (such as N-terminal, C-terminal or<br>
internal deletions). Fragments or portions in which only contiguous amino acids have<br>
been deleted or in which non-contiguous amino acids have been deleted relative to<br>
mature saporin are also envisioned. A variety of active variants of saporin can be<br>
prepared. For example, fusion proteins of saporin-6 that contain amino-terminal<br>
extensions have been prepared and shown to retain full ribosome-inhibiting activity in<br>
rabbit reticulocyte lysate assays. (Barthelemy, I. et al., J. Biol. Chem. 268:6541-6548<br>
(1993).) Variants or saporin-6 is which an active site residue, Tyr72, Tyrl20, Glul76,<br>
Arg 179 or Trp208 (amino acids 72, 120, 176, 179 or 208 of SEQ ID NO:65), was<br>
replaced with alanine had reduced cytotoxic activity in in vitro assays. (Bagga, S. et al.,<br>
J. Biol. Chem. 278:4813-4820 (2003).) Accordingly, if preparing additional functional<br>
variants of saporin is desired, mutation, substitution, replacement, deletion or<br>
modification of the active site residues should be avoided. Preferably, a functional<br>
variant of saporin that contains fewer amino acids than naturally occurring mature<br>
polypeptide includes at least the active site. For example, a variant of saporin-6 that<br>
contains fewer amino acids than naturally occurring mature saporin-6 can include the<br>
active site residues of mature saporin-6 (Tyr72, Tyrl20, Glul76, Arg 179 and Trp208<br>
(amino acids 72,120,176, 179 and 208 of SEQ ID NO:65)), and be at least about 137<br>
amino acids in length, at least about 150 amino acids in length, at least about 175 amino<br>
acids in length, at least about 200 amino acids in length, at least about 225 amino acids<br>
in length or at least about 250 amino acids in length.<br>
A "functional variant" of saporin has ribosome-inactivating activity (e.g.,<br>
rRNA N-Glycosidase activity) and/or cytotoxic activity. Such activity can readily be<br>
assessed using any suitable method, such as inhibition of protein synthesis using the<br>
well-known rabbit reticulocyte lysate assay or any of the well-known cytotoxicity<br><br>

assays that employ tumor cell lines. (See, e.g., Bagga, S. et al., J. Biol. Chem.<br>
278:4813-4820 (2003) and Barthelemy, I. et al., J. Biol. Chem. 268:6541-6548 (1993).)<br>
In some embodiments, a functional variant of saporin has at least about<br>
80%, or at least about 85%, or at least about 90%, or at least about 91%, or at least<br>
about 92%, or at least about 93%, or at least about 94%, or at least about 95%, or at<br>
least about 96%, or at least about 97%, or at least about 98%, or at least about 99%<br>
ammo acid sequence identity with mature saporin-6 (SEQ ID NO:65).<br>
The invention relates to compositions that comprise a drug and a polypeptide<br>
binding moiety that contains an antigen-binding site that has binding specificity for a<br>
polypeptide that enhances serum half-live in vivo. As described herein in detail with<br>
respect to compositions that comprise and antigen-binding fragment of an antibody that<br>
has binding specificity for serum albumin, the drug and the binding polypeptide can be<br>
conjugated covalently or noncovalently. In some embodiments, the composition is a<br>
fusion protein that comprises a polypeptide drug and a polypeptide binding moiety that<br>
contains an antigen-binding site that has binding specificity for a polypeptide that<br>
enhances serum half-live in vivo. In other embodiments, the composition comprises a<br>
drug that is covalently or noncovalently bonded to a polypeptide binding moiety that<br>
contains an antigen-binding site that has binding specificity for a polypeptide that<br>
enhances serum half-live in vivo.<br>

Typically, a polypeptide that enhances serum half-life in vivo is a polypeptide<br>
which occurs naturally in vivo and which resists degradation or removal by endogenous<br>
mechanisms which remove unwanted material from the organism (e.g., human). For<br>
example, a polypeptide that enhances serum half-life in vivo can be selected from<br>
proteins from the extracellular matrix, proteins found in blood, proteins found at the<br>
blood brain barrier or in neural tissue, proteins localized to the kidney, liver, lung, heart,<br>
skin or bone, stress proteins, disease-specific proteins, or proteins involved in Fc<br>
transport.<br>
Suitable polyp eptides that enhance serum half-life in vivo include, for example,<br>
transferrin receptor specific ligand-neuropharmaceutical agent fusion proteins (see U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,977,307, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference),<br>
brain capillary endothelial cell receptor, transferrin, transferrin receptor (e.g., soluble<br>
transferrin receptor), insulin, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF 1) receptor, insulin-like<br>
growth factor 2 (IGF 2) receptor, insulin receptor, blood coagulation factor X, cd-<br>
antitrypsin and HNF la Suitable polypeptides that enhance serum half-life also include<br>
alpha-1 glycoprotein (orosomucoid; AAG), alpha-1 antichymotrypsin (ACT), alpha-1<br>
microglobulin (protein HC; AIM), antithrombin III (AT III), apolipoprotein A-l (Apo<br>
A-l), apolipoprotein B (Apo B), ceruloplasmin (Cp), complement component C3 (C3),<br>
complement component C4 (C4), Cl esterase inhibitor (Cl INH), C-reactive protein<br>
(CRP), ferritin (FER), hemopexin (HPX), lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)), mannose-binding<br>
protein (MBP), myoglobin (Myo), prealbumin (transthyretin; PAL), retinol-binding<br>
protein (RBP), and rheumatoid factor (RF).<br>
Suitable proteins from the extracellular matrix include, for example, collagens,<br>
laminins, integrins and fibronectin. Collagens are the major proteins of the extracellular<br>
matrix. About 15 types of collagen molecules are currently known, found in different<br>
parts of the body, e.g. type I collagen (accounting for 90% of body collagen) found in<br>
bone, skin, tendon, ligaments, cornea, internal organs or type II collagen found in<br>
cartilage, vertebral disc, notochord, and vitreous humor of the eye.<br>
Suitable proteins from the blood include, for example, plasma proteins (e.g.,<br>
fibrin, ce-2 macroglobulin, serum albumin, fibrinogen (e.g., fibrinogen A, fibrinogen B),<br>
serum amyloid protein A, haptoglobin, profilin, ubiquitin, uteroglobulin and a-2-<br>
microglobulin), enzymes and enzyme inhibitors (e.g., plasminogen, lysozyme, cystatin<br><br>
WO 2006/059106	PCT/GB2005/004599<br>
-19-<br>
C, alpha- 1-antitrypsin and pancreatic trypsin inhibitor), proteins of the immune system,<br>
such as immunoglobulin proteins (e.g., IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, IgM, immunoglobulin light<br>
chains (kappa/lambda)), transport proteins (e.g., retinol binding protein, a-1<br>
microglobulin), defensins (e.g., beta-defensin 1, neutrophil defensin 1, neutrophil<br>
defensin 2 and neutrophil defensin 3) and the like.<br>
Suitable proteins found at the blood brain barrier or in neural tissue include, for<br>
example, melanocortin receptor, myelin, ascorbate transporter and the like.<br>
Suitable polypeptides that enhances serum half-life in vivo also include proteins<br>
localized to the kidney (e.g., polycystin, type IV collagen, organic anion transporter Kl,<br>
Heymann's antigen), proteins localized to the liver (e.g., alcohol dehydrogenase, G250),<br>
proteins localized to the lung (e.g., secretory component, which binds IgA), proteins<br>
localized to the heart (e.g., HSP 27, which is associated with dilated cardiomyopathy),<br>
proteins localized to the skin (e.g., keratin), bone specific proteins such as morphogenic<br>
proteins (BMPs), which are a subset of the transforming growth factor R superfamily of<br>
proteins that demonstrate osteogenic activity (e.g., BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-5, BMP-6,<br>
BMP-7, BMP-8), tumor specific proteins (e.g., trophoblast antigen, herceptin receptor,<br>
oestrogen receptor, cathepsins (e.g., cathepsin B, which can be found in liver and<br>
spleen)).<br>
Suitable disease-specific proteins include, for example, antigens expressed only<br>
on activated T-cells, including LAG-3 (lymphocyte activation gene), osteoprotegerin<br>
ligand (OPGL; see Nature 402, 304-309 (1999)), OX40 (a member of the TNF receptor<br>
family, expressed on activated T cells and specifically up-regulated in human T cell<br>
leukemia virus type-I (HTLV-I)-producing cells; see Immunol. 165 (l):263-70 (2000)).<br>
Suitable disease-specific proteins also include, for example, metalloproteases<br>
(associated with arthritis/cancers) including CG6512 Drosophila, human paraplegin,<br>
human FtsH, human AFG3L2, murine ftsH; and angiogenic growth factors, including<br>
acidic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-1), basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2), vascular<br>
endothelial growth factor/vascular permeability factor (VEGF/VPF), transforming<br>
growth factor-a (TGF-a), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a), angiogenin, interleukin-<br>
3 (IL-3), interleukin-8 (IL-8), platelet-derived endothelial growth factor (PD-ECGF),<br>
placental growth factor (P1GF), midkine platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF),<br>

-20-<br>
Suitable polypeptides that enhance serum half-life in vivo also include stress<br>
proteins such as heat shock proteins (HSPs). HSPs are normally found intracellularly.<br>
When they are found extracellularly, it is an indicator that a cell has died and spilled out<br>
its contents. This unprogrammed cell death (necrosis) occurs when as a result of trauma,<br>
disease or injury, extracellular HSPs trigger a response from the immune system.<br>
Binding to extracellular HSP can result in localizing the compositions of the invention<br>
to a disease site.<br>
Suitable proteins involved in Fc transport include, for example, Brambell<br>
receptor (also known as FcRB). This Fc receptor has two functions, both of which are<br>
potentially useful for delivery. The functions are (1) transport of IgG from mother to<br>
child across the placenta (2) protection of IgG from degradation thereby prolonging its<br>
serum half-life. It is thought that the receptor recycles IgG from endosomes. (See,<br>
Holliger et al, Nat Biotechnol 15(7):632-6 (1997).)<br>
The drug compositions of the invention can comprise any polypeptide binding<br>
moiety that contains a binding site {e.g., an antigen-binding site) that has binding<br>
specificity for a polypeptide that enhances serum half-life in vivo. Preferably, the<br>
polypeptide binding moiety comprises at least 31, at least about 40, at least about 50, at<br>
least about 60, at least about 70, at least about 80 amino acids, at least about 90 amino<br>
acids, at least about 100 amino acids or at lease about 110 amino acids as a separate<br>
molecular entity. Preferably, the polypeptide binding moiety binds a polypeptide that<br>
enhances serum half-life in vivo with a KD of at least about 5 mM KD (KD=Koff<br>
(kd)/Kon (ka)). In some embodiments, the polypeptide binding moiety binds a<br>
polypeptide that enhances serum half-life in vivo with a KD of about 10 to about 100<br>
nM, or about 100 nM to about 500 nM, or about 500 nM to about 5 mM, as determined<br>
by surface plasmon resonance {e.g., using a BIACORE instrument). In particular<br>
embodiments, the polypeptide binding moiety binds a polypeptide that enhances serum<br>
half-life in vivo with a KD of about 50 nM, or about 70 nM, or about 100 nM, or about<br>
150 nM or about 200 nM.<br>
Preferably, the polypeptide binding moiety that contains a binding site {e.g., an<br>
antigen-binding site) that has binding specificity for a polypeptide that enhances serum<br>
half-life in vivo is not a prokaryotic or bacterial polypeptide or peptide. Preferably, the<br><br>
WO 2006/059106	PCT/GB2005/004599<br>
-21-<br>
polypeptide binding moiety is a eukaryotic, mammalian or human polypeptide or<br>
peptide.<br>
In certain embodiments, the polypeptide binding moiety that contains a binding<br>
site (e.g., an antigen-binding site) that has binding specificity for a polypeptide that<br>
enhances serum half-life in vivo is a folded protein domain. In other embodiments, the<br>
polypeptide binding moiety has a molecular weight of at least about 4 KDa, at least<br>
about 4.5 KDa, at least about 5 KDa, at least about 5.5 KDa, at least about 6 KDa, at<br>
least about 6.5 KDa, at least about 7 KDa, at least about 7.5 KDa or at least about 8<br>
KDa as a separate molecular entity.<br>
Suitable polypeptide binding moieties that contain a binding site (e.g., an<br>
antigen-binding site) that has binding specificity for a polypeptide that enhances serum<br>
half-life in vivo can be identified using any suitable method, such as by screening<br>
naturally occurring or non-naturally occurring polypeptides in a suitable adhesion assay.<br>
As described herein, preferred polypeptide binding moieties that have an antigen-<br>
binding site for a polypeptide that enhances serum half-life in vivo are antigen-binding<br>
fragments of antibodies that have binding specificity for serum albumin. However,<br>
antigen-binding fragments of antibodies that have binding specificity for other<br>
polypeptides that enhance serum half-life in vivo can be used in the invention.<br>
If desired, one or more of the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of<br>
an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof that binds a polypeptide that enhances<br>
serum half-life in vivo can be formatted into a non-immunoglobulin structure that<br>
retains the antigen-binding specificity of the antibody or antigen-binding fragment. The<br>
drug compositions of the invention can comprise such a non-immunoglobulin binding<br>
moiety. Such non-immunoglobulin binding moieties can be prepared using any<br>
suitable method, for example natural bacterial receptors such as SpA have been used as<br>
scaffolds for the grafting of CDRs to generate polypeptide binding moieties which<br>
specifically bind an epitope. Details of this procedure are described in U.S. Patent<br>
Application No. 5,831,012, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Other suitable scaffolds include those based on fibronectin and affibodies. Details of<br>
suitable procedures are described in WO 98/58965. Other suitable scaffolds include<br>
lipocallin and CTLA4, as described in van den Beuken et al, J. Mol. Biol. 310:591-601<br>
(2001), and scaffolds such as those described in WO 00/69907 (Medical Research<br><br>
WO 2006/059106	PCT/GB2005/004599<br>
-22-<br>
Council), which are based for example on the ring structure of bacterial GroEL or other<br>
chaperone polypeptides.<br>
In some embodiments, the drug composition of the invention comprises a non-<br>
immunoglobulin binding moiety that has binding specificity for serum albumin, wherein<br>
the non-immunoglobulin binding moiety comprises one, two or three of the CDRs of a<br>
VH, VK or VRH described herein and a suitable scaffold, hi certain embodiments, the<br>
non-immunoglobulin binding moiety comprises CDR3 but not CDR1 or CDR2 of a VH,<br>
VK or VHH described herein and a suitable scaffold. In other embodiments, the non-<br>
immunoglobulin binding moiety comprises CDR1 and CDR2, but not CDR3 of a VH,<br>
VK or VHH described herein and a suitable scaffold. In other embodiments, the non-<br>
immunoglobulin binding moiety comprises CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 of a VH, VK or<br>
VHH described herein and a suitable scaffold. In other embodiments, the drug<br>
composition comprises only CDR3 of a VH, VK or VHH described herein and a drug.<br>
The drug compositions of the invention can be prepared using suitable methods,<br>
such as the methods described herein for preparation of drug fusions, drug conjugates<br>
and noncovalent drug conjugates. Additionally, the drug compositions of the invention<br>
have the advantages and the utilities that are described in detail herein with respect to<br>
drug fusions, drug conjugates and noncovalent drug conjugates.<br>
The invention provides drug compositions (e.g., drug conjugates, noncovalent<br>
drug conjugates, drug fusions) that have improved pharmacokinetic properties (e.g.,<br>
increase serum half-life) and other advantages in comparison to the drug alone<br>
(unconjugated drug, unfused drug). The drug conjugates, noncovalent drug conjugates<br>
and drug fusions comprise an antigen-binding fragment of an antibody that has binding<br>
specificity for serum albumin and one or more desired drugs.<br>
As described herein, drug compositions (e.g., drug conjugates, noncovalent drug<br>
conjugates, drug fusions) of the invention can have dramatically prolonged in vivo<br>
serum half-life and/or increased AUC, as compared to drug alone. In addition, the<br>
activity of the drug is generally not substantially altered in the drug composition (e.g.,<br>
drug conjugate, noncovalent drug conjugate, drag fusion). However, some change in<br>
the activity of a drag composition compared to drug alone is acceptable and is generally<br>
compensated for by the improved pharmacokinetic properties of the drag composition<br>
(e.g., drag conjugate, noncovalent drag conjugate, drag fusion). For example, drag<br><br>
WO 2006/059106	PCT/GB2005/004599<br>
-23-<br>
compositions (e.g., drug conjugates, noncovalent drag conjugates, drug fusions) may<br>
bind the drug target with lower affinity than drug alone, but have about equivalent or<br>
superior efficacy in comparison to drug alone due to the improved pharmacokinetic<br>
properties (e.g., prolonged in vivo serum half-life, larger AUC) of the drug composition.<br>
In addition, lower amounts of drug compositions (e.g., drug conjugates, noncovalent<br>
drug conjugates and drug fusions) can be administered to achieve the desired<br>
therapeutic or diagnostic effect. Preferably the activity of the drug composition (e.g.,<br>
drug conjugate, noncovalent drug conjugate, drug fusion) differs from that of the drug<br>
alone by a factor of no more than about 100, or no more than about 50, or no more than<br>
about 10, or no more than about 5, or no more than about 4, or no more than about 3, or<br>
no more than about 2. For example, a drug can have a KD, Ki or neutralizing dose 50<br>
(ND50) of 1 nM, and a drug composition (e.g., drug conjugate, noncovalent drag<br>
conjugate, drug fusion) can have a KD, Ki or ND50 of about 2 nM, or about 3 nM, or<br>
about 4 nM, or about 5 nM, or about 10 nM.<br>
Preferably, the activity of the drag composition (e.g., drag conjugate,<br>
noncovalent drag conjugate, drag fusion) is not substantially reduced as compared to<br>
the activity of the drag. In certain embodiments, the activity of the drag composition is<br>
reduced, relative to the activity of drug, by no more than about 10%, no more than about<br>
9%, no more than about 8%, no more than about 7%, no more than about 6%, no more<br>
than about 5%, no more than about 4%, no more than about 3%, no more than about<br>
2%, no more than about 1% or is substantially unchanged. Alternatively stated, the<br>
drag composition (e.g., drug conjugate, noncovalent drag conjugate, drag fusion)<br>
retains at least about 90%, at least about 91%, at least about 92%, at least about 93%, at<br>
least about 94%, at least about 95%, at least about 96%, at least about 97%, at least<br>
about 98%, at least about 99% of the activity of the drag, or substantially the same<br>
activity as the drag. Preferably, the activity of drag compositions (e.g., drag conjugate,<br>
noncovalent drag conjugate, drag fusion) and drugs are determined and/or compared on<br>
a "drug basis."<br>
As described and shown herein, the drag compositions (e.g., drag conjugate,<br>
noncovalent drag conjugate, drag fusion) of the invention can have greater activity (e.g.,<br>
in vivo activity) than drag alone. For example, as shown in Example 6, DOM7m-16/IL-<br>
lra was more effective in treating arthritis in a mouse model than IL-lra when these<br><br>
WO 2006/059106	PCT/GB2005/004599<br>
-24-<br>
agents were administered at the same dose by weight (10 mg/Kg or 1 mg/Kg).<br>
DOM7m-16/IL-lra was more effective even though its molecular weight is<br>
approximately twice the molecular weight of IL-lra. Thus, mice that received<br>
DOM7m-16/IL-lra received only about half of the IL-lra (as a moiety in D0M7m-<br>
16/ILl-ra) as mice that received IL-lra.<br>
In certain embodiments, the drug composition (e.g., drug conjugate, noncovalent<br>
drug conjugate, drug fusion) has greater activity (e.g., in vivo activity) than drug, for<br>
example, the drug composition can have at least about 100%, at least about 150%, at<br>
least about 200%, at least about 250%, at least about 300%, at least about 350%, at least<br>
about 400%, at least about 450%, or at least about 500% of the activity of drug.<br>
Preferably, the activity of drug compositions (e.g., drug conjugate, noncovalent drug<br>
conjugate, drug fusion) and drugs are determined and/or compared on a "drug basis."<br>
The activity of drug compositions (e.g., drug conjugate, noncovalent drug conjugate,<br>
drug fusion) and drugs can be determined using a suitable in vitro or in vivo system. In<br>
certain embodiments, a drug composition (e.g., drug conjugate, noncovalent drug<br>
conjugate, drug fusion) has greater activity than the drug it comprises, as determined in<br>
vivo. In.other embodiments, a drug composition (e.g., drug conjugate, noncovalent drug<br>
conjugate, drug fusion) has greater activity than the drug it comprises, as determined in<br>
vitro.<br>
Drug compositions (e.g., drug conjugates, noncovalent drug conjugates, drug<br>
fusions) that comprise a domain antibody (dAb) that has binding specificity for serum<br>
albumin provide further advantages. Domain antibodies are very stable, are small<br>
relative to antibodies and other antigen-binding fragments of antibodies, can be<br>
produced in high yields by expression in E. coli or yeast (e.g., Pichia pastoris), and as<br>
described herein antigen-binding fragments of antibodies that bind serum albumin can<br>
be easily selected from libraries of human origin or from any desired species.<br>
Accordingly, drug compositions (e.g., drug conjugates, noncovalent drug conjugates,<br>
drug fusions) that comprise a dAb that binds serum albumin can be produced more<br>
easily than therapeutics that are generally produced in mammalian cells (e.g., human,<br>
humanized or chimeric antibodies) and dAbs that are not imrnunogenic can be used<br>
(e.g., a human dAb can be used for a drug fusion or drug conjugate for treating or<br>
diagnosing disease in humans.)<br><br>

The immunogenicity of a drag can be reduced when the drag is part of a drag<br>
composition (e.g., drag conjugate, noncovalent drag conjugate, drag fusion) that<br>
contains a polypeptide binding moiety that binds serum albumin (e.g., an antigen-<br>
binding fragment of an antibody that binds serum albumin). Accordingly, a drag can be<br>
less immunogenic (than drag alone) or be substantially non-immunogenic in the context<br>
of a drag composition that contains a polypeptide binding moiety that binds serum<br>
albumin (e.g., drag conjugate, noncovalent drag conjugate, drag fusion). Thus, such<br>
drug compositions (e.g., drag conjugates, noncovalent drag conjugates, drag fusions)<br>
can be administered to a subject repeatedly over time with minimal loss of efficacy due<br>
to the elaboration of anti-drug antibodies by the subject's immune system.<br>
Additionally, the drag compositions (e.g., drag conjugates, noncovalent drug<br>
conjugates, drag fusions) described herein can have an enhanced safety profile and<br>
fewer side effects than drag alone. For example, as a result of the serum albumin-<br>
binding activity of the antigen-binding fragment of an antibody that has binding<br>
specificity for serum albumin, the drug fusions and conjugates (drag conjugate,<br>
noncovalent drag conjugate) have enhanced residence time in the vascular circulation.<br>
Additionally, the conjugates and drag fusions are substantially unable to cross the blood<br>
brain barrier and to accumulate in the central nervous system following systemic<br>
administration (e.g., intravascular administration). Accordingly, conjugates (drag<br>
conjugate, noncovalent drag conjugate) and drag fusions that contain a drug that has<br>
neurological toxicity or undesirable psychotropic effects can be administered with<br>
greater safety and reduced side effects in comparison to the drug alone. Similarly, the<br>
conjugates (drag conjugate, noncovalent drug conjugate) and drag fusions can have<br>
reduced toxicity toward particular organs (e.g., kidney or liver) than drag alone. The<br>
conjugates and drug fusions described herein can also be used to sequester a drag or a<br>
target that binds a drug (e.g, a toxin) in the vascular circulation, thereby decreasing the<br>
effects of the drag or target on tissues (e.g., inhibiting the effects of a toxin).<br>
Suitable methods for pharmacokinetic analysis and determination of in vivo half-<br>
life are well known in the art. Such methods are described, for example, in Kenneth, A<br>
et al: Chemical Stability of Pharmaceuticals: A Handbook for Pharmacists, and in<br>
Peters et al, Pharmacokinetc analysis: A Practical Approach (1996). Reference is also<br>
made to "Pharmacokinetics", M Gibaldi &amp; D Perron, published by Marcel Dekker, 2nd<br><br>
WO 2006/059106	PCT/GB2005/004599<br>
-26-<br>
Rev. edition (1982), which describes pharmacokinetic parameters such as t alpha and t<br>
beta half-lives (t1/2 alpha, t1/2 beta) and area under curve (AUC).<br>
Half-lives (t1/2 alpha and t1/2 beta) and AUC can be determined from a curve of<br>
serum concentration of conjugate or fusion against time. The WinNonlin analysis<br>
package (available from Pharsight Corp., Mountain View, CA 94040, USA) can be<br>
used, for example, to model the curve. In a first phase (the alpha phase) the drug<br>
composition {e.g., drug conjugate, noncovalent drag conjugate, drug fusion) is<br>
undergoing mainly distribution in the patient, with some elimination. A second phase<br>
(beta phase) is the tenninal phase when the drug composition {e.g., drag conjugate,<br>
noncovalent drag conjugate, drag fusion) has been distributed and the serum<br>
concentration is decreasing as the drag composition is cleared from the patient. The t<br>
alpha half-life is the half-life of the first phase and the t beta half-life is the half-life of<br>
the second phase. Thus, the present invention provides a drag composition {e.g., drag<br>
conjugate, noncovalent drag conjugate, drug fusion) or a composition comprising a drag<br>
composition {e.g., drag conjugate, noncovalent drug conjugate, drag fusion) according<br>
to the invention having a ta half-life in the range of 15 minutes or more. In one<br>
embodiment, the lower end of the range is 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 3<br>
hours, 4 hours, 5 hours, 6 hours, 7 hours, 8 hours, 9 hours, 10 hours, 11 hours or 12<br>
hours. In addition, or alternatively, a drug composition {e.g., drag conjugate,<br>
noncovalent drag conjugate, drag fusion) or composition according to the invention will<br>
have a tee half-life in the range of up to and including 12 hours. In one embodiment, the<br>
upper end of the range is 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6 or 5 hours. An example of a suitable range is<br>
1 to 6 hours, 2 to 5 hours or 3 to 4 hours.<br>
Advantageously, the present invention provides drug compositions {e.g., drug<br>
conjugates, noncovalent drag conjugates, drug fusions) having a tj(3 half-life in the range<br>
of 2.5 hours or more. In one embodiment, the lower end of the range is 3 hours, 4<br>
hours, 5 hours, 6 hours, 7 hours, 8 hours, 9 hours, 10 hours, 11 hours, or 12 hours. In<br>
some embodiments, the drag compositions {e.g., drag conjugates, noncovalent drag<br>
conjugates, drag fusions) have a tÎ² half-life in the range of up to and including 21 days.<br>
In one embodiment, the upper end of the range is 12 hours, 24 hours, 2 days, 3 days, 5<br>
days, 10 days, 15 days or 20 days. In particular embodiments, a drag composition {e.g.,<br>
drag conjugate, noncovalent drag conjugate, drug fusion) according to the invention<br><br>
WO 2006/059106	PCT/GB2005/004599<br>
-27-<br>
will have a tÎ² half-life in the range 12 to 60 hours. In a further embodiment, it will be<br>
in the range 12 to 48 hours. In a further embodiment still, it will be in the range 12 to<br>
26 hours.<br>
In addition, or alternatively to the above criteria, the present invention provides<br>
drug compositions {e.g., drug conjugates, noncovalent drug conjugates, drug fusions)<br>
having an AUC value(area under the curve) in the range of 0.01 mg.min/mL or more, or<br>
1 mg.min/mL or more. In one embodiment, the lower end of the range is 0.01, 0.1, 1, 5,<br>
10,15, 20, 30, 100, 200 or 300 mg.min/mL. In particular embodiments, the drug<br>
composition {e.g., drug conjugate, noncovalent drug conjugate, drug fusion) has an<br>
AUC in the range of up to 600 mg.min/mL. In one embodiment, the upper end of the<br>
range is 500, 400, 300, 200, 150,100, 75 or 50 mg.min/mL. In other embodiments, the<br>
drug composition {e.g., drug conjugate, noncovalent drug conjugate, drug fusion) has an<br>
AUC in the range selected from the group consisting of the following: 15 to 150<br>
mg.min/mL, 15 to 100 mg.min/mL, 15 to 75 mg.min/mL, 15 to 50 mg.min/mL, 0.01 to<br>
50 mg.min/mL, 0.1 to 50 mg.min/mL, 1 to 50 mg.min/mL, 5 to 50 mg.min/mL, and 10<br>
to 50 mg.min/mL.<br>
The invention relates to drug compositions {e.g., drug conjugates, noncovalent<br>
drug conjugates, drug fusions) that comprise a drug and a polypeptide binding moiety<br>
that contains a binding site {e.g., an antigen-binding site) that has binding specificity for<br>
a polypeptide that enhances serum half-life in vivo. In preferred embodiments of drug<br>
compositions, the polypeptide binding moiety that contains a binding site {e.g., an<br>
antigen-binding site) that has binding specificity for a polypeptide that enhances serum<br>
half-life in vivo, has binding specificity for serum albumin.<br>
In some embodiments, the drug composition comprises a drug that is covalently<br>
bonded to a polypeptide binding moiety that contains a binding site (e.g., an antigen-<br>
binding site) that has binding specificity for a polypeptide that enhances serum half-life<br>
in vivo. In these embodiments, the drug can be covalently bonded to the polypeptide<br>
binding domain at any suitable position, such as the amino-terminus, the carboxyl-<br>
terminus or through suitable amino acid side chains {e.g., the s amino group of lysine or<br>
thiol group of cysteine).<br>
In other embodiments, the drug composition comprises a drug that is<br>
noncovalently bonded to a polypeptide binding moiety that contains a binding site (e.g.,<br><br>
WO 2006/059106	PCT/GB2005/004599<br>
-28-<br>
an antigen-binding site) that has binding specificity for a polypeptide that enhances<br>
serum half-life in vivo, hi such embodiments, the drug can be noncovalently bonded to<br>
the antigen-binding fragment directly (e.g., through electrostatic interaction,<br>
hydrophobic interaction) or indirectly (e.g., through noncovalent binding of<br>
complementary binding partners (e.g., biotin and avidin), wherein one partner is<br>
covalently bonded to drug and the complementary binding partner is covalently bonded<br>
to the antigen-binding fragment). When complementary binding partners are employed,<br>
one of the binding partners can be covalently bonded to the drug directly or through a<br>
suitable linker moiety, and the complementary binding partner can be covalently bonded<br>
to the polypeptide binding domain directly or through a suitable linker moiety.<br>
In other embodiments, the drug composition is a fusion protein that comprises a<br>
polypeptide binding moiety that contains a binding site (e.g., an antigen-binding site)<br>
that has binding specificity for a polypeptide that enhances serum half-life in vivo and a<br>
polypeptide drug. The fusion proteins comprise a continuous polypeptide chain, said<br>
chain comprising a polypeptide binding moiety that contains a binding site (e.g., an<br>
antigen-binding site) that has binding specificity for a polypeptide that enhances serum<br>
half-life in vivo as a first moiety, and a polypeptide drug as a second moiety, which are<br>
present as discrete parts (moieties) of the polypeptide chain. The first and second<br>
moieties can be directly bonded to each other through a peptide bond, or linked through<br>
a suitable amino acid, or peptide or polypeptide linker. Additional moieties (e.g., third,<br>
fourth) and/or linker sequences can be present as appropriate. The first moiety can be in<br>
an N-terminal location, C-terminal location or internal relative to the second moiety<br>
(i.e., the polypeptide drag). In certain embodiments, the fusion protein comprises one<br>
or more one or more polypeptide binding moieties that contain a binding site that has<br>
binding specificity for a polypeptide that enhances serum half-life in vivo and one or<br>
more polypeptide drug moieties. In these embodiments, the fusion protein can comprise<br>

The polypeptide binding moieties that contain a binding site that has binding<br>
specificity for a polypeptide that enhances serum half-life in vivo and polypeptide drag<br>
moieties can be present in any desired location. For example, proceeding from the<br>
amino terminus to the carboxyl terminus, the moieties can be present in the following<br>
order: one or more polypeptide binding moieties, one or more polypeptide drug<br>
moieties, one or more polypeptide binding moieties. In another example, proceeding<br>
from the amino terminus to the carboxyl terminus, the moieties can be present in the<br>
following order: one or more polypeptide binding moieties, one or more polypeptide<br>
drag moieties, one or more polypeptide binding moieties, one or more polypeptide drag<br>
moieties, one or more polypeptide binding moieties. As described herein, the<br>
polypeptide binding moieties and polypeptide drag moieties can be directly bonded to<br>
each other through a peptide bond, or linked through a suitable amino acid, or peptide or<br>
polypeptide linker.<br>

In some embodiments, n2 is one, two, three, four, five or six, and n3 is zero. In<br>
other embodiments, n3 is one, two, three, four, five or six, and n2 is zero. In other<br>
embodiments, nl, n2 and n3 are each one.<br>
In certain embodiments, X does not comprises an antibody chain or a fragment<br>
of an antibody chain.<br>
In preferred embodiments, P and Q are each independently a polypeptide<br>
binding moiety that has binding specificity for serum albumin.<br>
In particularly preferred embodiments, the drug composition {e.g., drug<br>
conjugate, noncovalent drag conjugate, drug fusion) comprises a polypeptide binding<br>
moiety that contains a binding site {e.g., an antigen-binding site) that has binding<br>
specificity for a polypeptide that enhances serum half-life in vivo, wherein the<br>
polypeptide binding domain is an antigen-binding fragment of an antibody that has<br>
binding specificity for serum albumin.<br>
Antigen-binding Fragment of an Antibody that Binds Serum Albumin<br>
The drug conjugates, noncovalent drag conjugates and drag fusions of the<br>
invention comprise an {i.e., one or more) antigen-binding fragment of an antibody that<br>
binds serum albumin. The antigen-binding fragment can have binding specificity for<br>
serum albumin of an animal to which the drag conjugate or drag fusion will be<br>
administered. Preferably, the antigen-binding fragment has binding specificity for<br>
human serum albumin. However, veterinary applications are contemplated and the<br>
antigen-binding fragment can have binding specificity for serum albumin from a desired<br>
animal, for example serum albumin from dog, cat, horse, cow, chicken, sheep, pig, goat,<br>
deer, mink, and the like. In some embodiments the antigen-binding fragment has<br>
binding specificity for serum albumin from more than one species. For example, as<br>
described herein, human dAbs that have binding specificity for rat serum albumin and<br>
mouse serum albumin, and a dAb that has binding specificity for rat, mouse and human<br>
serum albumin have been produced. (Table 1 and FIG. 7) Such dAbs provide the<br>
advantage of allowing preclinical and clinical studies using the same drag conjugate or<br>
drug fusion and obviate the need to conduct preclinical studies with a suitable surrogate<br>
drag fusion or drug conjugate.<br><br>
WO 2006/059106	PCT/GB2005/004599<br>
-31-<br>
Antigen-binding fragments suitable for use in the invention include, for<br>
example, Fab fragments, Fab' fragments, F(ab')2 fragments, Fv fragments (including<br>
single chain Fv (scFv) and disulfide bonded Fv), a single variable domain, and dAbs<br>
(VH, VL). Such antigen-binding fragments can be produced using any suitable method,<br>
such as by proteolysis of an antibody using pepsin, papain or other protease having the<br>
requisite cleavage specificity, or using recombinant techniques. For example, Fv<br>
fragments can be prepared by digesting an antibody with a suitable protease or using<br>
recombinant DNA technology. For example, a nucleic acid can be prepared that<br>
encodes a light chain variable region and heavy chain variable region that are connected<br>
by a suitable peptide linker, such as a chain of two to about twenty Glycyl residues.<br>
The nucleic acid can be introduced into a suitable host (e.g., E. coli) using any suitable<br>
technique (e.g., transfection, transformation, infection), and the host can be maintained<br>
under conditions suitable for expression of a single chain Fv fragment. A variety of<br>
antigen-binding fragments of antibodies can be prepared using antibody genes in which<br>
one or more stop codons have been introduced upstream of the natural stop site. For<br>
example, an expression construct encoding a F(ab')2 portion of an immunoglobulin<br>
heavy chain can be designed by introducing a translation stop codon at the 3' end of the<br>
sequence encoding the hinge region of the heavy chain. The drug conjugates,<br>
noncovalent drug conjugates and drug fusions of the invention can comprise the<br>
individual heavy and light chains of antibodies that bind serum albumin or portions of<br>
the individual chains that bind serum albumin (e.g., a single VH, VK or Vx).<br>
Antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof which bind a desired serum<br>
albumin (e.g., human serum albumin) can be selected from a suitable collection of<br>
natural or artificial antibodies or raised against an appropriate immunogen in a suitable<br>
host. For example, antibodies can be raised by immunizing a suitable host (e.g., mouse,<br>
human antibody-transgenic mouse, rat, rabbit, chicken, goat, non-human primate (e.g.,<br>
monkey)) with serum albumin (e.g., isolated or purified human serum albumin) or a<br>
peptide of serum albumin (e.g., a peptide comprising at least about 8, 9,10,11,12,15,<br>
20, 25, 30, 33, 35, 37, or 40 amino acid residues). Antibodies and antigen-binding<br>
fragments that bind serum albumin can also be selected from a library of recombinant<br>
antibodies or antigen-binding fragments, such as a phage display library. Such libraries<br>
can contain antibodies or antigen-binding fragments of antibodies that contain natural or<br><br>
WO 2006/059106	PCT/GB2005/004599<br>
-32-<br>
artificial amino acid sequences. For example, the library can contain Fab fragments<br>
which contain artificial CDRs (e.g., random amino acid sequences) and human<br>
framework regions. (See, for example, U.S. Patent No. 6,300,064 (Knappik, et al.).) In<br>
other examples, the library contains scFv fragments or dAbs (single VH, single VK or<br>
single V\) with sequence diversity in one or more CDRs. (See, e.g., WO 99/20749<br>
(Tomlinson and Winter), WO 03/002609 A2 (Winter et al), WO 2004/003019A2<br>
(Winter et al.).)<br>
Suitable antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof that bind serum<br>
albumin include, for example, human antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof,<br>
humanized antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof, chimeric antibodies and<br>
antigen-binding fragments thereof, rodent (e.g., mouse, rat) antibodies and antigen-<br>
binding fragments thereof, and Camelid antibodies and antigen-binding fragments<br>
thereof. In certain embodiments, the drug conjugates, noncovalent drug conjugates and<br>
drug fusions comprises a Camelid VHH that binds serum albumin. Camelid VHHS are<br>
immunoglobulin single variable domain polypeptides which are derived from heavy<br>
chain antibodies that are naturally devoid of light chains. Such antibodies occur in<br>
Camelid species including camel, llama, alpaca, dromedary, and guanaco. VHH<br>
molecules are about ten times smaller than IgG molecules, and as single polypeptides,<br>
are very stable and resistant to extreme pH and temperature conditions. Suitable<br>
Camelid VHH that bind serum albumin include those disclosed in WO 2004/041862<br>
(Ablynx N.V.) and herein (FIG. 15 and SEQ ID NOS:77-88). In certain embodiments,<br>
the Camelid VHH binds human serum albumin and comprises an amino acid sequence<br>
that has at least about 80%, or at least about 85%, or at least about 90%, or at least about<br>
95%, or at least about 96%, or at least about 97%, or at least about 98%, or at least<br>
about 99% amino acid sequence identity with SEQ ID NO: 72, SEQ ID NO:73, SEQ ID<br>
NO:74, SEQ ID NO:75, SEQ ID NO:76, SEQ ID NO:77, SEQ ID NO:78, SEQ ID<br>

NO:84, SEQ ID NO:85, SEQ ID NO:86, SEQ ID NO:87, or SEQ ID NO:88. Amino<br>
acid sequence identity is preferably determined using a suitable sequence alignment<br>
algorithm and default parameters, such as BLAST P (Karlin and Altschul, Proc. Natl.<br>
Acad. Sci. USA 57(6):2264-2268 (1990)).<br><br>
WO 2006/059106	PCT/GB2005/004599<br>
-33-<br>
Preparation of the immunizing antigen, and polyclonal and monoclonal antibody<br>
production can be performed using any suitable technique. A variety of methods have<br>
been described. (See, e.g., Kohler et al, Nature, 256: 495-497 (1975) and Eur. J.<br>
Immunol. 6: 511-519 (1976); Milstein et al, Nature 266: 550-552 (1977); Koprowski et<br>
al, U.S. Patent No. 4,172,124; Harlow, E. and D. Lane, 1988, Antibodies: A<br>
Laboratory Manual, (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory: Cold Spring Harbor, NY);<br>
Current Protocols In Molecular Biology, Vol. 2 (Supplement 27, Summer '94),<br>
Ausubel, F.M. et al, Eds., (John Wiley &amp; Sons: New York, NY), Chapter 11, (1991).)<br>
Generally, where a monoclonal antibody is desired, a hybridoma is produced by fusing<br>
suitable cells from an immortal cell line {e.g., a myeloma cell line such as SP2/0,<br>
P3X63Ag8.653 or a heteromyeloma) with antibody-producing cells. Antibody-<br>
producing cells can be obtained from the peripheral blood or, preferably the spleen or<br>
lymph nodes, of humans, human-antibody transgenic animals or other suitable animals<br>
immunized with the antigen of interest. Cells that produce antibodies of human origin<br>
{e.g., a human antibody) can be produced using suitable methods, for example, fusion of<br>
a human antibody-producing cell and a heteromyeloma or trioma, or immortalization of<br>
an activated human B cell via infection with Epstein Barr virus. (See, e.g., U.S. Patent<br>
No. 6,197,582 (Trakht); Niedbala et al, Hybridoma, 17:299-304 (1998); Zanella et al,<br>
J Immunol Methods, 156:205-215 (1992); Gustafsson et al, Hum Antibodies<br>
Hybridomas, 2:26-32 (1991).) The fused or immortalized antibody-producing cells<br>
(hybridomas) can be isolated using selective culture conditions, and cloned by limiting<br>
dilution. Cells which produce antibodies with the desired specificity can be identified<br>
using a suitable assay {e.g., ELISA).<br>
Antibodies also can be prepared directly {e.g., synthesized or cloned) from an<br>
isolated antigen-specific antibody producing cell {e.g., a cell from the peripheral blood<br>
or, preferably the spleen or lymph nodes determined to produce an antibody with<br>
desired specificity), of humans, human-antibody transgenic animals or other suitable<br>
animals immunized with the antigen of interest (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,627,052<br>
(Schrader)).<br>
When the drug conjugate, noncovalent drug conjugate or drug fusion is for<br>
administration to a human, the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof that binds<br>
serum albumin {e.g., human serum albumin) can be a human, humanized or chimeric<br><br>
WO 2006/059106	PCT/GB2005/004599<br>
-34-<br>
antibody or an antigen-binding fragment of such an antibody. These types of antibodies<br>
and antigen-binding fragments are less immunogenic or non-immunogenic in humans<br>
and provide well-known advantages. For example, drug conjugates, noncovalent drug<br>
conjugates or drug fusions that contain an antigen-binding fragment of a human,<br>
humanized or chimeric antibody can be administered repeatedly to a human with less or<br>
no loss of efficacy (compared with other fully immunogenic antibodies) due to<br>
elaboration of human antibodies that bind to the drug conjugate or drug fusion. When<br>
the drug conjugate, noncovalent drug conjugate or drug fusion is intended for veterinary<br>
administration, analogous antibodies or antigen-binding fragments can be used. For<br>
example, CDRs from a murine or human antibody can be grafted onto framework<br>
regions from a desired animal, such as a horse or cow.<br>
Human antibodies and nucleic acids encoding same can be obtained, for<br>
example, from a human or from human-antibody transgenic animals. Human-antibody<br>
transgenic animals (e.g., mice) are animals that are capable of producing a repertoire of<br>
human antibodies, such as XENOMOUSE (Abgenix, Fremont, CA), HUMAB-<br>
MOUSE, KHUN TC MOUSE or KM-MOUSE (MEDAREX, Princeton, NJ).<br>
Generally, the genome of human-antibody transgenic animals has been altered to<br>
include a transgene comprising DNA from a human immunoglobulin locus that can<br>
undergo functional rearrangement. An endogenous immunoglobulin locus in a human-<br>
antibody transgenic animal can be disrupted or deleted to eliminate the capacity of the<br>
animal to produce antibodies encoded by an endogenous gene. Suitable methods for<br>
producing human-antibody transgenic animals are well known in the art. (See, for<br>
example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,939,598 and 6,075,181 (Kucherlapati et al), U.S. Pat. Nos.<br>

foregoing are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.)<br>
Human-antibody transgenic animals can be immunized with a suitable antigen<br>
{e.g., human serum albumin), and antibody producing cells can be isolated and fused to<br>
form hybridomas using conventional methods. Hybridomas that produce human<br>
antibodies having the desired characteristics (e.g., specificity, affinity) can be identified<br>
using any suitable assay (e.g., ELISA) and, if desired, selected and subcloned using<br>
suitable culture techniques.<br>
Humanized antibodies and other CDR-grafted antibodies can be prepared using<br>
any suitable method. The CDRs of a CDR-grafted antibody can be derived from a<br>
suitable antibody which binds a serum albumin (referred to as a donor antibody). Other<br>
sources of suitable CDRs include natural and artificial serum albumin-specific<br>
antibodies obtained from human or nonhuman sources, such as rodent (e.g., mouse, rat,<br>
rabbit), chicken, pig, goat, non-human primate (e.g., monkey) or a library.<br>
The framework regions of a humanized antibody are preferably of human origin,<br>
and can be derived from any human antibody variable region having sequence similarity<br>
to the analogous or equivalent region (e.g., heavy chain variable region or light chain<br>
variable region) of the antigen-binding region of the donor antibody. Other sources of<br>
framework regions of human origin include human variable region consensus<br>
sequences. (See, e.g., Kettleborough, C.A. et al, Protein Engineering 4:773-783<br>
(1991); Carter et al, WO 94/04679; Kabat, E.A., et al, Sequences of Proteins of<br>
Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,<br>
U.S. Government Printing Office (1991)). Other types of CDR grafted antibodies can<br>
contain framework regions of suitable origin, such as framework regions encoded by<br>
germline antibody gene segments from horse, cow, dog, cat and the like.<br>
Framework regions of human origin can include amino acid substitutions or<br>
replacements, such as "back mutations" which replace an amino acid residue in the<br>
framework region of human or animal origin with a residue from the corresponding<br>
position of the donor antibody. One or more mutations in the framework region can be<br><br>
WO 2006/059106	PCT/GB2005/004599<br>
-36-<br>
made, including deletions, insertions and substitutions of one or more amino acids.<br>
Variants can be produced by a variety of suitable methods, including mutagenesis of<br>
nonhuman donor or acceptor human chains. (See, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 5,693,762<br>
(Queen et al.) and 5,859,205 (Adair et al), the entire teachings of which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference.)<br>
Constant regions of antibodies, antibody chains {e.g., heavy chain, light chain)<br>
or fragments or portions thereof, if present, can be derived from any suitable source.<br>
For example, constant regions of human, humanized and certain chimeric antibodies,<br>
antibody chains (e.g., heavy chain, light chain) or fragments or portions thereof, if<br>
present can be of human origin and can be derived from any suitable human antibody or<br>
antibody chain. For example, a constant region of human origin or portion thereof can<br>
be derived from a human K or X light chain, and/or a human y (e.g., yl, y2, y3, y4), fi, a<br>
(e.g., al, od), 8 or e heavy chain, including allelic variants. In certain embodiments, the<br>
antibody or antigen-binding fragment (e.g., antibody of human origin, human antibody)<br>
can include amino acid substitutions or replacements that alter or tailor function (e.g.,<br>
effector function). For example, a constant region of human origin (e.g., yl constant<br>
region, y2 constant region) can be designed to reduce complement activation and/or Fc<br>
receptor binding. (See, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,648,260 (Winter et al.),<br>
5,624,821 (Winter et al.) and 5,834,597 (Tso et al), the entire teachings of which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference.) Preferably, the amino acid sequence of a constant<br>
region of human origin that contains such amino acid substitutions or replacements is at<br>
least about 95% identical over the full length to the amino acid sequence of the<br>
unaltered constant region of human origin, more preferably at least about 99% identical<br>
over the full length to the amino acid sequence of the unaltered constant region of<br>
human origin.<br>
Humanized antibodies, CDR grafted antibodies or antigen-binding fragments of<br>
a humanized or CDR grafted antibody can be prepared using any suitable method.<br>
Several such methods are well-known in the art. (See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,225,539<br>
(Winter), U.S. Patent No. 5,530,101 (Queen et al.)) The portions of a humanized or<br>
CDR grafted antibody (e.g., CDRs, framework, constant region) can be obtained or<br>
derived directly from suitable antibodies (e.g., by de novo synthesis of a portion), or<br>
nucleic acids encoding an antibody or chain thereof having the desired property (e.g.,<br><br>
WO 2006/059106	PCT/GB2005/004599<br>
-37-<br>
binds serum albumin) can be produced and expressed. To prepare a portion of a chain,<br>
one or more stop codons can be introduced at the desired position. For example, nucleic<br>
acid (e.g., DNA) sequences coding for humanized or CDR grafted variable regions can<br>
be constructed using PCR mutagenesis methods to alter existing DNA sequences. (See,<br>
e.g., Kamman, M., et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 17:5404 (1989).) PCR primers coding for the<br>
new CDRs can be hybridized to a DNA template of a previously humanized variable<br>
region which is based on the same, or a very similar, human variable region (Sato, K., et<br>
al., Cancer Research 53:851-856 (1993)). If a similar DNA sequence is not available<br>
for use as a template, a nucleic acid comprising a sequence encoding a variable region<br>
sequence can be constructed from synthetic oligonucleotides (see e.g., Kolbinger, F.,<br>
Protein Engineering 8:971-980 (1993)). A sequence encoding a signal peptide can also<br>
be incorporated into the nucleic acid (e.g., on synthesis, upon insertion into a vector).<br>
The natural signal peptide sequence from the acceptor antibody, a signal peptide<br>
sequence from another antibody or other suitable sequence can be used (see, e.g.,<br>
Kettleborough, C.A., Protein Engineering 4:773-783 (1991)). Using these methods or<br>
other suitable methods, variants can be readily produced. In one embodiment, cloned<br>
variable regions can be mutated, and sequences encoding variants with the desired<br>
specificity can be selected (e.g., from a phage library; see, e.g., U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,514,548 (Krebber et al.) and WO 93/06213 (Hoogenboom et al.)).<br>
The antibody or antigen-binding fragment that binds serum albumin can be a<br>
chimeric antibody or an antigen-binding fragment of a chimeric antibody. The chimeric<br>
antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof comprises a variable region from one<br>
species (e.g., mouse) and at least a portion of a constant region from another species<br>
(e.g., human). Chimeric antibodies and antigen-binding fragments of chimeric<br>
antibodies can be prepared using any suitable method. Several suitable methods are<br>
well-known in the art. (See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567 (Cabilly et al), U.S. Patent<br>
No. 5,116,946 (Capon et al.))<br>
A preferred method for obtaining antigen-binding fragments of antibodies that<br>
bind serum albumin comprises selecting an antigen-binding fragment (e.g., scFvs,<br>
dAbs) that has binding specificity for a desired serum albumin from a repertoire of<br>
antigen-binding fragments. For example, as described herein dAbs that bind serum<br>
albumin can be selected from a suitable phage display library. A number of suitable<br><br>
WO 2006/059106	PCT/GB2005/004599<br>
-38-<br>
bacteriophage display libraries and selection methods (e.g., monovalent display and<br>
multivalent display systems) have been described. (See, e.g., Griffiths et al, U.S.<br>
Patent No. 6,555,313 Bl (incorporated herein by reference); Johnson etal., U.S. Patent<br>
No. 5,733,743 (incorporated herein by reference); McCafferty et al, U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,969,108 (incorporated herein by reference); Mulligan-Kehoe, U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,702,892 (incorporated herein by reference); Winter, G. et al, Annu. Rev. Immunol.<br>
12:433-455 (1994); Soumillion, P. etal, Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol 47(2-3):175-189<br>
(1994); Castagnoli, L. etal, Comb. Chem. High Throughput Screen, 4(2):121-133<br>
(2001); WO 99/20749 (Tomlinson and Winter); WO 03/002609 A2 (Winter et al); WO<br>
2004/003019A2 (Winter et al).) The polypeptides displayed in a bacteriophage library<br>
can be displayed on any suitable bacteriophage, such as a filamentous phage (e.g., fd,<br>
Ml3, Fl), a lytic phage (e.g., T4, T7, lambda), or an RNA phage (e.g., MS2), for<br>
example, and selected for binding to serum albumin (e.g., human serum albumin).<br>
Generally, a library of phage that displays a repertoire of polypeptides as fusion<br>
proteins with a suitable phage coat protein is used. Such a library can be produced<br>
using any suitable methods, such as introducing a library of phage vectors or phagemid<br>
vectors encoding the displayed antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof into<br>
suitable host bacteria, and culturing the resulting bacteria to produce phage (e.g., using a<br>
suitable helper phage or complementing plasmid if desired). The library of phage can<br>
be recovered from such a culture using any suitable method, such as precipitation and<br>
centrifugation.<br>
The library can comprise a repertoire of antibodies or antigen-binding fragments<br>
thereof that contains any desired amount of amino acid sequence diversity. For<br>
example, the repertoire can contain antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof that<br>
have amino acid sequences that correspond to naturally occurring antibodies from a<br>
desired organism, and/or can contain one or more regions of random or randomized<br>
amino acid sequences (e.g., CDR sequences). The antibodies or antigen-binding<br>
fragments thereof in such a repertoire or library can comprise defined regions of random<br>
or randomized amino acid sequence and regions of common amino acid sequence. In<br>
certain embodiments, all or substantially all polypeptides in a repertoire are a desired<br>
type of antigen-binding fragment of an antibody (e.g., human VH or human VL). For<br><br>
WO 2006/059106	PCT/GB2005/004599<br>
-39-<br>
example, each polypeptide in the repertoire can contain a VH, a VL or an Fv (e.g., a<br>
single chain Fv).<br>
Amino acid sequence diversity can be introduced into any desired region of<br>
antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof using any suitable method. For<br>
example, amino acid sequence diversity can be introduced into a target region, such as a<br>
complementarity determining region of an antibody variable domain, by preparing a<br>
library of nucleic acids that encode the diversified antibodies or antigen-binding<br>
fragments thereof using any suitable mutagenesis methods (e.g., low fidelity PCR,<br>
oligonucleotide-mediated or site directed mutagenesis, diversification using NNK<br>
codons) or any other suitable method. If desired, a region of the antibodies or antigen-<br>
binding fragments thereof to be diversified can be randomized.<br>
A suitable phage display library can be used to selected antibodies or antigen-<br>
binding fragments of antibodies that bind serum albumin and have other beneficial<br>
properties. For example, antibodies or antigen-binding fragments that resist aggregation<br>
when unfolded can be selected. Aggregation is influenced by polypeptide concentration<br>
and is thought to arise in many cases from partially folded or unfolded intermediates.<br>
Factors and conditions that favour partially folded intermediates, such as elevated<br>
temperature and high polypeptide concentration, promote irreversible aggregation.<br>
(Fink, A.L., Folding &amp; Design J:R1-R23 (1998).) For example, storing purified<br>
polypeptides in concentrated form, such as a lyophilized preparation, frequently results<br>
in irreversible aggregation of at least a portion of the polypeptides. Also, production of<br>
a polypeptide by expression in biological systems, such as E. coli, often results in the<br>
formation of inclusion bodies which contain aggregated polypeptides. Recovering<br>
active polypeptides from inclusion bodies can be very difficult and require adding<br>
additional steps, such as a refolding step, to a biological production system.<br>
Antibodies and antigen-binding fragments that resist aggregation and unfold<br>
reversibly when heated can be selected from a suitable phage display library.<br>
Generally, a phage display library comprising a repertoire of displayed antibodies or<br>
antigen-binding fragments thereof is heated to a temperature (Ts) at which at least a<br>
portion of the displayed antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof are unfolded,<br>
then cooled to a temperature (Tc) wherein Ts&gt;Tc, whereby at least a portion of the<br>
antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof have refolded and a portion of the<br><br>
WO 2006/059106	PCT/GB2005/004599<br>
-40-<br>
polypeptides have aggregated. Then, antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof<br>
that unfold reversibly and bind serum albumin are recovered at a temperature (Tr). The<br>
recovered antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof that unfolds reversibly has a<br>
melting temperature (Tm), and preferably, the repertoire was heated to Ts, cooled to Tc<br>
and the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof that unfolds reversibly was<br>
isolated at Tr, such that Ts&gt;Tm&gt;Tc, and Ts&gt;Tm&gt;Tr. Generally, the phage display<br>
library is heated to about 80Â°C and cooled to about room temperature or about 4Â°C<br>
before selection. Antibodies or antigen-binding fragment thereof that unfold reversibly<br>
and resist aggregation can also be designed or engineered by replacing certain amino<br>
acid residue with residues that confer the ability to unfold reversibly. (See, WO<br>
2004/101790 (Jespers et ah), and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Nos: 60/470,340<br>
(filed on May 14, 2003) and 60/554,021 (filed on March 17, 2004) for detailed<br>
discussion of methods for selecting and for designing or engineering antibodies or<br>
antigen-binding fragments thereof that unfold reversibly. The teachings of WO<br>
2004/101790 and both of the foregoing U.S. Provisional Patent Applications are<br>
incorporated herein by reference.).<br>
Antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof that unfold reversibly and resist<br>
aggregation provide several advantages. For example, due to their resistance to<br>
aggregation, antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof that unfold reversibly can<br>
readily be produced in high yield as soluble proteins by expression using a suitable<br>
biological production system, such as E. coli. In addition, antibodies or antigen-binding<br>
fragments thereof that unfold reversibly can be formulated and/or stored at higher<br>
concentrations than conventional polypeptides, and with less aggregation and loss of<br>
activity. DOM7h-26 (SEQ ID NO:20) is a human VH that unfolds reversibly.<br>
Preferably, the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof that binds serum<br>
albumin comprises a variable domain (VH, V/C, V\) in which one or more of the<br>
framework regions (FR) comprise (a) the amino acid sequence of a human framework<br>
region, (b) at least 8 contiguous amino acids of the amino acid sequence of a human<br>
framework region, or (c) an amino acid sequence encoded by a human germline<br>
antibody gene segment, wherein said framework regions are as defined by Kabat. In<br>
certain embodiments, the amino acid sequence of one or more of the framework regions<br>
is the same as the amino acid sequence of a corresponding framework region encoded<br><br>
WO 2006/059106	PCT/GB2005/004599<br>
-41-<br>
by a human germline antibody gene segment, or the amino acid sequences of one or<br>
more of said framework regions collectively comprise up to 5 amino acid differences<br>
relative to the amino acid sequence of said corresponding framework region encoded by<br>
a human germline antibody gene segment.<br>
In other embodiments, the amino acid sequences of FR1, FR2, FR3 and FR4 are<br>
the same as the amino acid sequences of corresponding framework regions encoded by<br>
a human germline antibody gene segment, or the amino acid sequences of FR1, FR2,<br>
FR3 and FR4 collectively contain up to 10 amino acid differences relative to the amino<br>
acid sequences of corresponding framework regions encoded by said human germline<br>
antibody gene segments. In other embodiments, the amino acid sequence of said FR1,<br>
FR2 and FR3 are the same as the amino acid sequences of corresponding framework<br>
regions encoded by said human germline antibody gene segment.<br>
In particular embodiments, the antigen binding fragment of an antibody that<br>
binds serum albumin comprises an immunoglobulin variable domain (e.g., VH, VL)<br>
based on a human germline sequence, and if desired can have one or more diversified<br>
regions, such as the complementarity determining regions. Suitable human germline<br>
sequence for VH include, for example, sequences encoded by the VH gene segments<br>
DP4, DP7, DP8, DP9, DP10, DP31, DP33, DP45, DP46, DP47, DP49, DP50, DP51,<br>
DP53, DP54, DP65, DP66, DP67, DP68 and DP69, and the JH segments JH1, JH2,<br>
JH3, JH4, JH4b, JH5 and JH6. Suitable human germline sequence for VL include, for<br>
example, sequences encoded by the VK gene segments DPK1, DPK2, DPK3, DPK4,<br>
DPK5, DPK6, DPK7, DPK8, DPK9, DPK10, DPK12, DPK13, DPK15, DPK16,<br>
DPK18, DPK19, DPK20, DPK21, DPK22, DPK23, DPK24, DPK25, DPK26 and DPK<br>
28, and the JK segments 3K 1, J7C 2, J/c 3, JK 4 and J/c 5.<br>
In certain embodiments, the drug conjugate, noncovalent drug conjugate or drug<br>
fusion does not contain a mouse, rat and/or rabbit antibody that binds serum albumin or<br>
antigen-binding fragment of such an antibody.<br>
The antigen-binding fragment can bind serum albumin with any desired affinity,<br>
on rate and off rate. The affinity (KD), on rate (Kon or ka) and off rate (Koff or kd or Kd)<br>
can be selected to obtain a desired serum half-life for a particular drug. For example, it<br>
may be desirable to obtain a maximal serum half-life for a drug that neutralizes an<br>
inflammatory mediator of a chronic inflammatory disorder (e.g., a dAb that binds and<br><br>
WO 2006/059106	PCT/GB2005/004599<br>
-42-<br>
neutralizes an inflammatory cytokine), while a shorter half-life may be desirable for a<br>
drug that has some toxicity (e.g., a chemotherapeutic agent). Generally, a fast on rate<br>
and a fast or moderate off rate for binding to serum albumin is preferred. Drug<br>
conjugates and drug fusions that comprise an antigen-binding fragment with these<br>
characteristics will quickly bind serum albumin after being administered, and will<br>
dissociate and rebind serum albumin rapidly. These characteristics will reduce rapid<br>
clearance of the drug (e.g., through the kidneys) but still provide efficient delivery and<br>
access to the drug target.<br>
The antigen-binding fragment that binds serum albumin (e.g., dAb) generally<br>
binds with a KD of about 1 nM to about 500 piM. In some embodiments, the antigen-<br>
binding fragment binds serum albumin with a KD (KD=KOff (kd)/Kon (ka)) of about 10<br>
to about 100 nM, or about 100 nM to about 500 nM, or about 500 nM to about 5 mM, as<br>
determined by surface plasmon resonance (e.g., using a BIACORE instrument). In<br>
particular embodiments, the drug conjugate, noncovalent drug conjugate or drug fusion<br>
comprises and antigen-binding fragment of an antibody (e.g., a dAb) that binds serum<br>
albumin (e.g., human serum albumin) with a KD of about 50 nM, or about 70 nM, or<br>
about 100 nM, or about 150 nM or about 200 nM. The improved pharmacokinetic<br>
properties (e.g., prolonged tl/2/3, increased AUC) of drug conjugates, noncovalent drug<br>
conjugates and drug fusions described herein may correlate with the affinity of the<br>
antigen-binding fragment that binds serum albumin. Accordingly, drug conjugates,<br>
noncovalent drug conjugates and drug fusions that have improved pharmacokinetic<br>
properties can generally be prepared using an antigen-binding fragment that binds<br>
serum albumin (e.g., human serum albumin) with high affinity (e.g., KD of about 500<br>
nM or less, about 250 nM or less, about 100 nM or less, about 50 nM or less, about 10<br>
nM or less, or about 1 nM or less, or about 100 pM or less).<br>
Preferably, the drug that is conjugated or fused to the antigen-binding fragment<br>
that binds serum albumin, binds to its target (the drug target) with an affinity (KD) that<br>
is stronger than the affinity of the antigen-binding fragment for serum albumin and/or a<br>
Koff (kd) that is faster that the Koff of the antigen binding fragment for serum albumin, as<br>
measured by surface plasmon resonance (e.g., using a BIACORE instrument). For<br>
example, the drug can bind its target with an affinity that is about 1 to about 100000, or<br>
about 100 to about 100000, or about 1000 to about 100000, or about 10000 to about<br><br>
WO 2006/059106	PCT/GB2005/004599<br>
-43-<br>
100000 times stronger than the affinity of antigen-binding fragment that binds SA for<br>
SA. For example, the antigen-binding fragment of the antibody that binds SA can bind<br>
with an affinity of about 10 Î¼M, while the drug binds its target with an affinity of about<br>
100 pM.<br>
In particular embodiments, the antigen-binding fragment of an antibody that<br>
binds serum albumin is a dAb that binds human serum albumin. For example, a VK dAb<br>
having an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 10,<br>
SEQ ID NO:11, SEQ ID NO:12, SEQ ID NO:13, SEQ ID NO:14, SEQ ID NO:15, SEQ<br>
ID NO:24, SEQ ID NO:25 and SEQ ID NO:26, or a VH dAb having an amino acid<br>
sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 16, SEQ ID NO: 17, SEQ<br>
ID NO:18, SEQ ID NO:19, SEQ ID NO:20, SEQ ID NO:21, SEQ ID NO:22 and SEQ<br>
ID NO:23. In other embodiments, the antigen-binding fragment of an antibody that<br>
binds serum albumin is a dAb that binds human serum albumin and comprises the<br>
CDRs of any of the foregoing amino acid sequences. In other embodiments, the<br>
antigen-binding fragment of an antibody that binds serum albumin is a dAb that binds<br>
human serum albumin and comprises an amino acid sequence that has at least about<br>
80%, or at least about 85%, or at least about 90%, or at least about 95%, or at least<br>
about 96%, or at least about 97%, or at least about 98%, or at least about 99% amino<br>
acid sequence identity with SEQ ID NO: 10, SEQIDNO:11, SEQIDNO:12, SEQ ID<br>
NO: 13, SEQ ID NO: 14, SEQ ID NO: 15, SEQ ID NO:24, SEQ ID NO:25, SEQ ID<br>
NO:26, SEQ ID NO:16, SEQ ID NO:17, SEQ ID NO:18, SEQ ID NO:19, SEQ ID<br>
NO:20, SEQ ID NO:21, SEQ ID NO:22 or SEQ ID NO:23. Amino acid sequence<br>
identity is preferably determined using a suitable sequence alignment algorithm and<br>
default parameters, such as BLAST P (Karlin and Altschul, Proc. Natl Acad. Sd. USA<br>
57(6):2264-2268 (1990)).<br>

M.B., etal Biochem Cell Biol 80:65-74 (2002)).<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention the drugs are insulinotropic drugs.<br>
Examples of suitable insulinotropic drugs include GLP-1, GLP-1 derivative, GLP-1<br>
analogues or a derivative of a GLP-1 analogue. In addition they include Exedin-4,<br>
Exedin-4 analogues and Exedin-4 derivatives and Exedin-3, Exedin-3 derivatives and<br>
Exedin-3 analogues.<br>
Other suitable drugs include Peptide YY (3-36) or analogues. Peptide YY (PYY)<br>
is a 36-residue peptide amide isolated originally from porcine intestine, and localized in<br>
the endocrine cells of the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas (Tatemoto, et al. Proc. Natl.<br><br>
WO 2006/059106	PCT/GB2005/004599<br>
-49-<br>
Acad. Sci. 79:2514, 1982). Peptide YY has N-terminal and C-terminal tyrosine amides;<br>
accordingly, these two tyrosines give PYY its name (Y represents the amino acid<br>
tyrosine in the peptide nomenclature). In addition PYY shares a number of central and<br>
peripheral regulatory roles with its homologous peptide neuropeptide Y (NPY), which<br>
was originally isolated from porcine brain (Tatemoto, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 79:5485,<br>
1982). In contrast with the cellular location of PYY, NPY is present in submucous and<br>
myenteric neurons which innervate the mucosal and smooth muscle layers, respectively<br>
(Ekblad et al. Neuroscience 20:169, 1987). Both PYY and NPY are believed to inhibit<br>
gut motility and blood flow (Laburthe, Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1:168,1990), and<br>
they are also thought to attenuate basal (Cox et al. Br. J. Pharmacol. 101:247,1990) and<br>
secretagogue-induced intestinal secretion in rats (Lundberg et al Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci<br>
USA 79:4471, 1982), as well as stimulate net absorption (MacFadyen et al.<br>
Neuropeptides 7:219, 1986). Taken together, these observations suggest that PYY and<br>
NPY are released into the circulation after a meal (Adrian et al. Gastroenterology<br>
89:1070, 1985; Balasubramaniam et al. Neuropeptides 14:209, 1989), and thus play a<br>
physiological role in regulating intestinal secretion and absorption.<br>
A high affinity PYY receptor system which exhibits a slightly higher affinity for<br>
PYY than NPY has been characterized in rat intestinal epithelia (Laburthe et al.<br>
Endocrinology 118:1910,1986) and shown to be negatively coupled to adenylate<br>
cyclase (Servin et al. Endocrinology 124:692, 1989). Structure-activity studies using<br>
several partial sequences have led to the identification of PYY(22-36) as the active site<br>
for interacting with intestinal PYY receptors (Balsubramaniam et al. Pept. Res. 1:32,<br>
1988).<br>
In addition, PYY has been implicated in a number of physiological activities<br>
including nutrient uptake (Bilcheik et al. Digestive Disease Week 506:623,1993), cell<br>
proliferation (Laburthe, Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1:168,1990; Voisin et al. J. Biol.<br>
Chem, 1993), lipolysis (Valet et al, J. Clin. Invest. 291, 1990), and vasoconstriction<br>
(Lundberg et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA 79: 4471,1982).<br>

Drug Fusions<br>
The drug fusions of the invention are fusion proteins that comprise a continuous<br>
polypeptide chain, said chain comprising an antigen-binding fragment of an antibody<br>
that binds serum albumin as a first moiety, linked to a second moiety that is a<br>
polypeptide drug. The first and second moieties can be directly bonded to each other<br>
through a peptide bond, or linked through a suitable amino acid, or peptide or<br>
polypeptide linker. Additional moieties (e.g., third, fourth) and/or linker sequences can<br>
be present as appropriate. The first moiety can be in an N-terminal location, C-terminal<br>
location or internal relative to the second moiety (i.e., the polypeptide drug). In certain<br>
embodiments, each moiety can be present in more than one copy. For example, the<br>
drug fusion can comprise two or more first moieties each comprising an antigen-binding<br>
fragment of an antibody that binds serum albumin (e.g., a VH that binds human serum<br>
albumin and a VL that bind human serum albumin or two or more VHS or VLS that bind<br>
human serum albumin).<br>

one or more additional amino acids (e.g., comprise 153 or 154 or more amino acids).<br>
The drug fusions of the invention can be produced using any suitable method. For<br>
example, some embodiments can be produced by the insertion of a nucleic acid<br>
encoding the drug fusion into a suitable expression vector. The resulting construct is<br>

Examples of insulinotropic agents which can be useful as GLP-1 analogues or<br>
derivatives or GLP-1 like drugs according to the present invention are described in<br>
International Patent Application No. WO 87/06941 (The General Hospital Corporation)<br>

International Patent Application No. WO 91/11457 (Buckley et al..) discloses analogues<br>
of the active GLP-1 peptides 7-34,7-35, 7-36, and 7-37 which can also be useful as<br>
GLP-1 drugs according to the present invention (incorporated herein by reference,<br>
particularly by way of examples of drugs for use in the present invention).<br>
Further Exendin-analogs that are useful for the present invention are described<br>
in PCT patent publications WO 99/25728 (Beeley et al.), WO 99/25727 Beeley et al.),<br>
WO 98/05351 (Young et al.), WO 99/40788 (Young et al.), WO 99/07404 (Beeley et<br>
al), and WO 99/43708 (Knudsen et al) (all incorporated herein by reference, particularly<br>
by way of examples of drugs for use in the present invention).<br>
Suitable expression vectors can contain a number of components, for example,<br>
an origin of replication, a selectable marker gene, one or more expression control<br>
elements, such as a transcription control element (e.g., promoter, enhancer, terminator)<br>
and/or one or more translation signals, a signal sequence or leader sequence, and the<br>
like. Expression control elements and a signal sequence, if present, can be provided by<br>
the vector or other source. For example, the transcriptional and/or translational control<br>
sequences of a cloned nucleic acid encoding an antibody chain can be used to direct<br>
expression.<br>
A promoter can be provided for expression in a desired host cell. Promoters can<br>
be constitutive or inducible. For example, a promoter can be operably linked to a<br>
nucleic acid encoding an antibody, antibody chain or portion thereof, such that it directs<br>
transcription of the nucleic acid. A variety of suitable promoters for procaryotic (e.g.,<br>
lac, tac, T3, T7 promoters for E. coli) and eucaryotic (e.g., simian virus 40 early or late<br>
promoter, Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat promoter, cytomegalovirus<br>
promoter, adenovirus late promoter) hosts are available.<br>
In addition, expression vectors typically comprise a selectable marker for<br>
selection of host cells carrying the vector, and, in the case of a replicable expression<br>
vector, an origin or replication. Genes encoding products which confer antibiotic or<br>
drug resistance are common selectable markers and may be used in procaryotic (e.g.,<br>
lactamase gene (ampicillin resistance), Tet gene for tetracycline resistance) and<br>
eucaryotic cells (e.g., neomycin (G418 or geneticin), gpt (mycophenolic acid),<br>
ampicillin, or hygromycin resistance genes). Dihydrofolate reductase marker genes<br>
permit selection with methotrexate in a variety of hosts. Genes encoding the gene<br><br>

-60-<br>
product of auxotrophic markers of the host (e.g., LEU2, URA3, HIS3) are often used as<br>
selectable markers in yeast. Use of viral (e.g., baculovirus) or phage vectors, and<br>
vectors which are capable of integrating into the genome of the host cell, such as<br>
retroviral vectors, are also contemplated. Suitable expression vectors for expression in<br>
mammalian cells and prokaryotic cells (E. coli), insect cells (Drosophila Schnieder S2<br>
cells, Sf9) and yeast (P. methanolica, P. pastoris, S. cerevisiae) are well-known in the<br>
art.<br>
Recombinant host cells that express a drug fusion and a method of preparing a<br>
drug fusion as described herein are provided. The recombinant host cell comprises a<br>
recombinant nucleic acid encoding a drug fusion. Drug fusions can be produced by the<br>
expression of a recombinant nucleic acid encoding the protein in a suitable host cell, or<br>
using other suitable methods. For example, the expression constructs described herein<br>
can be introduced into a suitable host cell, and the resulting cell can be maintained (e.g.,<br>
in culture, in an animal) under conditions suitable for expression of the constructs.<br>
Suitable host cells can be prokaryotic, including bacterial cells such as E. coli, B.<br>
suhtilis and or other suitable bacteria, eucaryotic, such as fungal or yeast cells (e.g.,<br>
Pichia pastoris, Aspergillus species, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces<br>
pornbe, Neurospora crassa), or other lower eucaryotic cells, and cells of higher<br>
eucaryotes such as those from insects (e.g., Sf9 insect cells (WO 94/26087 (O'Connor))<br>
or mammals (e.g., COS cells, such as COS-1 (ATCC Accession No. CRL-1650) and<br>
COS-7 (ATCC Accession No. CRL-1651), CHO (e.g., ATCC Accession No. CRL-<br>
9096), 293 (ATCC Accession No. CRL-1573), HeLa (ATCC Accession No. CCL-2),<br>
CV1 (ATCC Accession No. CCL-70), WOP (Dailey et al, J. Virol. 54:139-149 (1985)),<br>
3T3, 293T (Pear et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 90:8392-8396 (1993)), NSO cells,<br>
SP2/0, HuT 78 cells, and the like (see, e.g., Ausubel, F.M. et al., eds. Current Protocols<br>
in Molecular Biology, Greene Publishing Associates and John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc.,<br>
(1993)).<br>
The invention also includes a method of producing a drug fusion, comprising<br>
maintaining a recombinant host cell of the invention under conditions appropriate for<br>
expression of a drug fusion. The method can further comprise the step of isolating or<br>
recovering the drug fusion, if desired, hi another embodiment, the components of the<br><br>

drug fusion (e.g., dAb that binds human serum albumin and EL-Ira) are chemically<br>
assembled to create a continuous polypeptide chain.<br>
Conjugates<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides conjugates comprising an antigen-<br>
binding fragment of an antibody that binds serum albumin that is bonded to a drug.<br>
Such conjugates include "drug conjugates," which comprise an antigen-binding<br>
fragment of an antibody that binds serum albumin to which a drug is covalently bonded,<br>
and "noncovlaent drug conjugates," which comprise an antigen-binding fragment of an<br>
antibody that binds serum albumin to which a drug is noncovalently bonded.<br>
Preferably, the conjugates are sufficiently stable so that the antigen-binding fragment of<br>
an antibody that binds serum albumin and drug remain substantially bonded (either<br>
covalently or noncovalently) to each other under in vivo conditions {e.g., when<br>
administered to a human). Preferably, no more than about 20%, no more than about<br>
15%, no more than about 10%, no more than about 9%, no more than about 8%, no<br>
more than about 7%, no more than about 6%, no more than about 5%, no more than<br>
about 4%, no more than about 3%, no more than about 2%, no more than about 1% or<br>
substantially none of the conjugates dissociate or break down to release drug and<br>
antigen-binding fragment under in vivo conditions. For example, stability under "in<br>
vivo" conditions can be conveniently assessed by incubating drug conjugate or<br>
noncovalent drug conjugate for 24 hours in serum {e.g., human serum) at 37Â°C. In one<br>
example of such a method, equal amounts of a drug conjugate and the unconjugated<br>
drug are diluted into two different vials of serum. Half of the contents of each vial is<br>
immediately frozen at -20Â°C, and the other half incubated for 24 hours at 37Â°C. All four<br>
samples can then be analyzed using any suitable method, such as SDS-PAGE and/or<br>
Western blotting. Western blots can be probed using an antibody that binds the drug.<br>
All drugs in the drug conjugate lanes will run at the size of the drug conjugate if there<br>
was no dissociation. Many other suitable methods can be used to assess stability under<br>
"in vivo" conditions, for example, by analyzing samples prepared as described above<br>
using suitable analytic methods, such as chromatography (e.g., gel filtration, ion<br>
exchange, and reverse phase), ELISA, mass spectroscopy and the like.<br><br>

Drug Conjugates<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides a drug conjugate comprising an<br>
antigen-binding fragment of an antibody that has binding specificity for serum albumin,<br>
and a drug that is covalently bonded to said antigen-binding fragment, with the proviso<br>
that the drug conjugate is not a single continuous polypeptide chain.<br>
In some embodiments, the drug conjugate comprises an immunoglobulin heavy<br>
chain variable domain (VH) that has binding specificity for serum albumin, or an<br>
immunoglobulin light chain variable domain (VL) that has binding specificity for serum<br>
albumin, and a drug that is covalently bonded to said VH or VL, with the proviso that the<br>
drug conjugate is not a single continuous polypeptide chain. Preferably the drug<br>
conjugate comprises a single VH that binds serum albumin or a single VL that binds<br>
serum albumin. In certain embodiments, the drug conjugate comprises a Vk dAb that<br>
binds human serum albumin and comprises an amino acid sequence selected from the<br>
group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 10, SEQ ID NO: 11, SEQ ID NO: 12, SEQ ID NO: 13,<br>
SEQ ID NO: 14, SEQ ID NO: 15, SEQ ID NO:24, SEQ ID NO:25 and SEQ ID NO:26.<br>
In other embodiments, the drug conjugate comprises a VH dAb that binds human serum<br>
albumin and comprises an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of<br>
SEQ ID NO:16, SEQ ID NO:17, SEQ ID NO:18, SEQ ID NO:19, SEQ ID NO:20, SEQ<br>
ID NO:21, SEQ ID NO:22 and SEQ ID NO:23.<br>
The drug conjugates can comprise any desired drug and can be prepared using<br>
any suitable methods. For example, the drug can be bonded to the antigen-binding<br>
fragment of an antibody that binds serum albumin directly or indirectly through a<br>
suitable linker moiety at one or more positions, such as the amino-terminus, the<br>
carboxyl-terminus or through amino acid side chains. In one embodiment, the drug<br>
conjugate comprises a dAb that binds human serum albumin and a polypeptide drug<br>
(e.g., human IL-lra or a functional variant of human IL-lra), and the amino-terminus of<br>
the polypeptide drug (e.g., human IL-lra or a functional variant of human IL-lra) is<br>
bonded to the carboxyl-terminus of the dAb directly or through a suitable linker moiety.<br>
In another embodiment, the drug conjugate comprises a dAb that binds human serum<br>
albumin and an insulinotropic drug (e.g., GLP-lor a GLP-1 analogue) and the amino-<br>
terminus of the insulinotropic drug is free (i.e. not coupled or bonded in the conjugate)<br>
and the carboxyl terminus is bonded to the amino-terminus of the dAb directly or<br><br>
WO 2006/059106	PCT/GB2005/004599<br>
-63-<br>
through a suitable linker moiety. In other embodiments, the drug conjugate comprises a<br>
dAb that binds human serum albumin and two or more different drugs that are<br>
covalently bonded to the dAb. For example, a first drug can be covalently bonded<br>
(directly or indirectly) to the carboxyl terminus of the dAb and a second drug can be<br>
covalently bonded (directly or indirectly) to the ammo-terminus or through a side chain<br>
ammo group (e.g., e amino group of lysine). In a preferred embodiment the amino-<br>
terminus of the insulinotropic drug (eg. GLP-lor a GLP-1 analogue) is free. Such drug<br>
conjugates can be prepared using well-known methods of selective coupling. (See, e.g.,<br>
Hermanson, G. T., Bioconjugate Techniques, Academic Press: San Diego, CA (1996).)<br>
A variety of methods for conjugating drugs to an antigen-binding fragment of an<br>
antibody that has binding specificity for serum albumin can be used. The particular<br>
method selected will depend on the drag to be conjugated. If desired, linkers that<br>
contain terminal functional groups can be used to link the antigen-binding fragment and<br>
the drug. Generally, conjugation is accomplished by reacting a drug that contains a<br>
reactive functional group (or is modified to contain a reactive functional group) with a<br>
linker or directly with an antigen-binding fragment of an antibody that binds serum<br>
albumin. Covalent bonds form by reacting a drug that contains (or is modified to<br>
contain) a chemical moiety or functional group that can, under appropriate conditions,<br>
react with a second chemical group thereby forming a covalent bond. If desired, a<br>
suitable reactive chemical group can be added to the antigen-binding fragment or to a<br>
linker using any suitable method. (See, e.g., Hermanson, G. T., Bioconjugate<br>
Techniques, Academic Press: San Diego, CA (1996).) Many suitable reactive chemical<br>
group combinations are known in the art, for example an amine group can react with an<br>
electrophilic group such as tosylate, mesylate, halo (chloro, bromo, fluoro, iodo), N-<br>
hydroxysuccinmiidyl ester (NHS), and the like. Thiols can react with maleimide,<br>
iodoacetyl, acrylolyl, pyridyl disulfides, 5-thiol-2-nitrobenzoic acid thiol (TNB-thiol),<br>
and the like. An aldehyde functional group can be coupled to amine- or hydrazide-<br>
containing molecules, and an azide group can react with a trivalent phosphorous group<br>
to form phosphoramidate or phosphorimide linkages. Suitable methods to introduce<br>
activating groups into molecules are known in the art (see for example, Hermanson, G.<br>
T., Bioconjugate Techniques, Academic Press: San Diego, CA (1996)).<br><br>
WO 2006/059106	PCT/GB2005/004599<br>
-64-<br>
In some embodiments, the antigen-binding fragment of an antibody that has<br>
binding specificity for serum albumin is bonded to a drug by reaction of two thiols to<br>
form a disulfide bond. In other embodiments, the antigen-binding fragment of an<br>
antibody that has binding specificity for serum albumin is bonded to a drug by reaction<br>
of an isothiocyanate group and a primary amine to produce an isothiourea bond.<br>
Suitable linker moieties can be linear or branched and include, for example,<br>
tetraethylene glycol, C2-Ci2 alkylene, -NH-(CH2)P-NH- or -(CH2)P-NH- (wherein p is<br>
one to twelve), -CH2-O-CH2-CH2-O-CH2-CH2-O-CH-NH-, a polypeptide chain<br>
comprising one to about 100 (preferably one to about 12) amino acids and the like.<br>
Noncovalent Drug Conjugates<br>
Some noncovalent bonds (e.g., hydrogen bonds, van der Waals interactions) can<br>
produce stable, highly specific intermolecular connections. For example, molecular<br>
recognition interactions achieved through multiple noncovalent bonds between<br>
complementary binding partners underlie many important biological interactions, such<br>
as the binding of enzymes to their substrates, the recognition of antigens by antibodies,<br>
the binding of ligands to their receptors, and stabilization of the three dimensional<br>
structure of proteins and peptide. Accordingly, such weak noncovalent interactions<br>
(e.g., hydrogen bonding, van Der Waals interactions, electrostatic interactions,<br>
hydrophobic interactions and the like) can be utilized to bind a drug to the antigen-<br>
binding fragment of an antibody that has binding specificity for serum albumin.<br>
Preferably, the noncovalent bond linking the antigen-binding fragment and drug<br>
be of sufficient strength that the antigen-binding fragment and drug remain substantially<br>
bonded to each under in vivo conditions (e.g., when administered to a human).<br>
Generally, the noncovalent bond linking the antigen-binding fragment and drug has a<br>
strength of at least about l010M"1. In preferred embodiments, the strength of the<br>
noncovalent bond is at least about l011M-1, at least about l012M-1, at least about 1013M"<br>
1, at least about 1014M'J or at least about l015M"1. The interactions between biotin and<br>
avidin and between biotin and streptavidin are known to be very efficient and stable<br>
under many conditions, and as described herein noncovalent bonds between biotin and<br>
avidin or between biotin and streptavidin can be used to prepare a noncovalent drug<br>
conjugate of the invention.<br><br>
WO 2006/059106	PCT/GB2005/004599<br>
-65-<br>
The noncovalent bond can be formed directly between the antigen-binding<br>
fragment of an antibody that has a specificity for serum albumin and drug, or can be<br>
formed between suitable complementary binding partners (e.g., biotin and avidin or<br>
streptavidin) wherein one partner is covalently bonded to drug and the complementary<br>
binding partner is covalently bonded to the antigen-binding fragment. When<br>
complementary binding partners are employed, one of the binding partners can be<br>
covalently bonded to the drug directly or through a suitable linker moiety, and the<br>
complementary binding partner can be covalently bonded to the antigen-binding<br>
fragement of an antibody that binds serum albumin directly or through a suitable linker<br>
moiety.<br>
Complementary binding partners are pairs of molecules that selectively bind to<br>
each other. Many complementary binding partners are known in the art, for example,<br>
antibody (or an antigen-binding fragment thereof) and its cognate antigen or epitope,<br>
enzymes and their substrates, and receptors and their ligands. Preferred complementary<br>
binding partners are biotin and avidin, and biotin and streptavidin.<br>
Direct or indirect covalent bonding of a member of a complementary binding<br>
pair to an antigen-binding fragment that has binding specificity for serum albumin or a<br>
drug can be accomplished as described above, for example, by reacting a<br>
complementary binding partner that contains a reactive functional group (or is modified<br>
to contain a reactive functional group) with an antigen-binding fragment of an antibody<br>
that binds serum albumin, with or without the use of a linker. The particular method<br>
selected will depend on the compounds (e.g., drug, complementary binding partner,<br>
antigen-binding fragment of an antibody that binds serum albumin) to be conjugated. If<br>
desired, linkers (e.g., homobifunctional linkers, heterobifunctional linkers) that contain<br>
terminal reactive functional groups can be used to link the antigen-binding fragment<br>
and/or the drug to a complementary binding partner. In one embodiment, a<br>
heterobifunctional linker that contains two distinct reactive moieties can be used. The<br>
heterobifunctional linker can be selected so that one of the reactive moieties will react<br>
with the antigen-binding fragment of an antibody that has binding specificity for serum<br>
albumin or the drug, and the other reactive moiety will react with the complementary<br>
binding partner. Any suitable linker (e.g., heterobifunctional linker) can be used and<br><br>
WO 2006/059106	PCT/GB2005/004599<br>
-66-<br>
many such linkers are known in the art and available for commercial sources (e.g.,<br>
Pierce Biotechnology, Inc., IL).<br>
Compositions and Therapeutic and Diagnostic Methods<br>
Compositions comprising drug compositions of the invention (e.g., drug<br>
conjugates, noncovalent drug conjugates, drug fusions), including pharmaceutical or<br>
physiological compositions (e.g., for human and/or veterinary administration) are<br>
provided. Pharmaceutical or physiological compositions comprise one or more drug<br>
compositions (e.g., drug conjugate, noncovalent drug conjugate, drug fusion), and a<br>
pharmaceutically or physiologically acceptable carrier. Typically, these carriers include<br>
aqueous or alcoholic/aqueous solutions, emulsions or suspensions, including saline<br>
and/or buffered media. Parenteral vehicles include sodium chloride solution, Ringer's<br>
dextrose, dextrose and sodium chloride and lactated Ringer's. Suitable physiologically-<br>
acceptable adjuvants, if necessary to keep a polypeptide complex in suspension, may be<br>
chosen from thickeners such as carboxymethylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gelatin<br>
and alginates. Intravenous vehicles include fluid and nutrient replenishers and<br>
electrolyte replenishers, such as those based on Ringer's dextrose. Preservatives and<br>
other additives, such as antimicrobials, antioxidants, chelating agents and inert gases,<br>
may also be present (Mack (1982) Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 16th Edition).<br>
The compositions can comprise a desired amount of drug composition (e.g.,<br>
drug conjugate, noncovalent drug conjugate, drag fusion). For example the<br>
compositions can comprise about 5% to about 99% drug conjugate, noncovalent drug<br>
conjugate or drug fusion by weight. In particular embodiments, the composition can<br>
comprise about 10% to about 99%, or about 20% to about 99%, or about 30% to about<br>
99% or about 40% to about 99%, or about 50% to about 99%, or about 60% to about<br>
99%, or about 70% to about 99%, or about 80% to about 99%, or about 90% to about<br>
99%, or about 95% to about 99% drug composition (e.g., drug conjugate, noncovalent<br>
drag conjugate, drag fusion), by weight. In one example, the composition is freeze<br>
dried (lyophilized).<br>
The drag compositions (e.g., drag conjugates, noncovalent drag conjugates, drag<br>
fusions), described herein will typically find use in preventing, suppressing or treating<br>
inflammatory states (e.g., acute and/or chronic inflammatory diseases), such as chronic<br><br>

-67-<br>
obstructive pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic bronchitis, chronic obstructive bronchitis,<br>
emphysema), allergic hypersensitivity, cancer, bacterial or viral infection, pneumonia,<br>
such as bacterial pneumonia (e.g., Staphylococcal pneumonia)), autoimmune disorders<br>
(which include, but are not limited to, Type I diabetes, multiple sclerosis, arthritis (e.g.,<br>
osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis,<br>
lupus arthritis, spondylarthropathy (e.g., ankylosing spondylitis)), systemic lupus<br>
erythematosus, inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis),<br>
Behcet's syndrome and myasthenia gravis), endometriosis, psoriasis, abdominal<br>
adhesions (e.g., post abdominal surgery), asthma, and septic shock. The drug<br>
compositions (e.g., drug conjugates, noncovalent drug conjugates, drug fusions),<br>

In the instant application, the term "prevention" involves administration of the<br>
protective composition prior to the induction of the disease. "Suppression" refers to<br>
administration of the composition after an inductive event, but prior to the clinical<br>
appearance of the disease. "Treatment" involves administration of the protective<br>
composition after disease symptoms become manifest.<br>
Animal model systems which can be used to screen the effectiveness of drug<br>
compositions (e.g., drug conjugates, noncovalent drug conjugates, drug fusions) in<br>
protecting against or treating the disease are available. Methods for the testing of<br>
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in susceptible mice are known in the art (Knight et<br>
al. (1978) J. Exp. Med., 147: 1653; Reinersten et al. (1978) NewEng. J. Med., 299:<br>
515). Myasthenia Gravis (MG) is tested in SJL/J female mice by inducing the disease<br>
with soluble AchR protein from another species (Lindstrom et al. (1988) Adv. Immunol.,<br>
42: 233). Arthritis is induced in a susceptible strain of mice by injection of Type II<br>
collagen (Stuart et al. (1984) Ann. Rev. Immunol., 42: 233). A model by which adjuvant<br>
arthritis is induced in susceptible rats by injection of mycobacterial heat shock protein<br>
has been described (Van Eden et al. (1988) Nature, 331: 171). Effectiveness for<br>
treating osteoarthritis can be assessed in a murine model in which arthritis is induced by<br>
intra-articular injection of collagenase (Blom, A.B. et al., Osteoarthritis Cartilage<br>
12:627-635 (2004). Thyroiditis is induced in mice by administration of thyroglobulin as<br>
described (Maron et al. (1980) J. Exp. Med., 152: 1115). Insulin dependent diabetes<br>
mellitus (IDDM) occurs naturally or can be induced in certain strains of mice such as<br>
those described by Kanasawa et al. (1984) Diabetologia, 27: 113. EAE in mouse and<br>
rat serves as a model for MS in human. Li this model, the demyelinating disease is<br>
induced by administration of myelin basic protein (see Paterson (1986) Textbook of<br><br>

The drag compositions {e.g., drag conjugates, noncovalent drug conjugates, drag<br>
fusions) of the present invention maybe used as separately administered compositions<br>
or in conjunction with other agents. These can include various immunotherapeutic<br>
drugs, such as cylcosporine, methotrexate, adriamycin or cisplatinum, immunotoxins<br>
and the like. Pharmaceutical compositions can include "cocktails" of various cytotoxic<br>
or other agents in conjunction with the drag composition {e.g., drag conjugate,<br>
noncovalent drag conjugate, drag fusion) of the present invention, or combinations of<br>
drug compositions {e.g., drag conjugates, noncovalent drug conjugates, drag fusions)<br>
according to the present invention comprising different drugs.<br>
The drag compositions {e.g., drag conjugates, noncovalent drag conjugates, drag<br>
fusions) can be administered to any individual or subject in accordance with any<br>
suitable techniques. A variety of routes of administration are possible including, for<br>
example, oral, dietary, topical, transdermal, rectal, parenteral {e.g., intravenous,<br>
intraarterial, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intradermal, intraperitoneal, intrathecal,<br>
intraarticular injection), and inhalation {e.g., intrabronchial, intranasal or oral inhalation,<br>
intranasal drops) routes of administration, depending on the drag composition and<br>
disease or condition to be treated. Administration can be local or systemic as indicated.<br>
The preferred mode of administration can vary depending upon the drag composition<br>
{e.g., drag conjugate, noncovalent drag conjugate, drag fusion) chosen, and the<br>
condition {e.g., disease) being treated. The dosage and frequency of administration will<br>
depend on the age, sex and condition of the patient, concurrent administration of other<br>
drugs, counterindications and other parameters to be taken into account by the clinician.<br>
A therapeutically effective amount of a drag composition {e.g., drag conjugate,<br>
noncovalent drug conjugate, drug fusion) is administered. A therapeutically effective<br>
amount is an amount sufficient to achieve the desired therapeutic effect, under the<br>
conditions of administration.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention pharmaceutical compositions<br>
containing a GLP-1 drag or GLP-1 analogue or derivative according to the present<br>
invention may be administered parenterally to patients in need of such a treatment.<br><br>
WO 2006/059106	PCT/GB2005/004599<br>
-73-<br>
Parenteral administration may be performed by subcutaneous, intramuscular or<br>
intravenous injection by means of a syringe, optionally a pen-like syringe. Alternatively,<br>
parenteral administration can be performed by means of an infusion pump. A further<br>
option is a composition which may be a powder or a liquid for the administration of the<br>
GLP-1 drug or GLP-1 analogue or derivative in the form of a nasal or pulmonal spray.<br>
As a still further option, the GLP-1 drug or GLP-1 analogue or derivative of the<br>
invention can also be administered transdermally, e. g. from a patch, optionally an<br>
iontophoretic patch, or transmucosally, e. g. bucally. In other embodiments the<br>
compositions are administered orally, eg as a pill, capsule, drink (eg, marketed as a<br>
weight-loss drink for obesity treatment).<br>
A composition for parenteral administration of GLP-1 compounds may, for<br>
example, be prepared as described in WO 03/002136 (incorporated herein by reference).<br>
A composition for nasal administration of certain peptides may, for example, be<br>
prepared as described in European Patent No. 272097 (to Novo Nordisk A/S) or in WO<br>
93/18785 (all incorporated herein by reference).<br>
The term "subject" or "individual" is defined herein to include animals such as<br>
mammals, including, but not limited to, primates (e.g., humans), cows, sheep, goats,<br>
horses, dogs, cats, rabbits, guinea pigs, rats, mice or other bovine, ovine, equine, canine,<br>
feline, rodent or murine species.<br>
The drug composition (e.g., drug conjugate, noncovalent drug conjugate, drug<br>
fusion) can be administered as a neutral compound or as a salt. Salts of compounds<br>
(e.g., drug compositions, drug conjugates, noncovalent drug conjugates, drug fusions)<br>
containing an amine or other basic group can be obtained, for example, by reacting with<br>
a suitable organic or inorganic acid, such as hydrogen chloride, hydrogen bromide,<br>
acetic acid, perchloric acid and the like. Compounds with a quaternary ammonium<br>
group also contain a counteranion such as chloride, bromide, iodide, acetate, perchlorate<br>
and the like. Salts of compounds containing a carboxylic acid or other acidic functional<br>
group can be prepared by reacting with a suitable base, for example, a hydroxide base.<br>
Salts of acidic functional groups contain a countercation such as sodium, potassium and<br>
the like.<br>
The invention also provides a kit for use in administering a drug composition<br>
(e.g., drug conjugate, noncovalent drug conjugate, drug fusion) to a subject (e.g.,<br><br>
WO 2006/059106	PCT/GB2005/004599<br>
-74-<br>
patient), comprising a drug composition (e.g., drug conjugate, noncovalent drug<br>
conjugate, drug fusion), a drug delivery device and, optionally, instructions for use. The<br>
drug composition (e.g., drug conjugate, noncovalent drug conjugate, drug fusion) can be<br>
provided as a formulation, such as a freeze dried formulation. In certain embodiments,<br>
the drag delivery device is selected from the group consisting of a syringe, an inhaler,<br>
an intranasal or ocular administration device (e.g., a mister, eye or nose dropper), and a<br>
needleless injection device.<br>
The drug composition (e.g., drug conjugate, noncovalent drag conjugate, drag<br>
fusion) of this invention can be lyophilized for storage and reconstituted in a suitable<br>
carrier prior to use. Any suitable lyophilization method (e.g., spray drying, cake drying)<br>
and/or reconstitution techniques can be employed. It will be appreciated by those<br>
skilled in the art that lyophilisation and reconstitution can lead to varying degrees of<br>
antibody activity loss (e.g., with conventional immunoglobulins, IgM antibodies tend to<br>
have greater activity loss than IgG antibodies) and that use levels may have to be<br>
adjusted to compensate. In a particular embodiment, the invention provides a<br>
composition comprising a lyophilized (freeze dried) drug composition (e.g., drug<br>
conjugate, noncovalent drag conjugate, drag fusion) as described herein. Preferably,<br>
the lyophilized (freeze dried) drag composition (e.g., drag conjugate, noncovalent drug<br>
conjugate, drug fusion) loses no more than about 20%, or no more than about 25%, or<br>
no more than about 30%, or no more than about 35%, or no more than about 40%, or no<br>
more than about 45%, or no more than about 50% of its activity (e.g., binding activity<br>
for serum albumin) when rehydrated. Activity is the amount of drug composition (e.g.,<br>
drug conjugate, noncovalent drug conjugate, drug fusion) required to produce the effect<br>
of the drag composition before it was lyophilized. For example, the amount of drag<br>
conjugate or drug fusion needed to achieve and maintain a desired serum concentration<br>
for a desired period of time. The activity of the drag composition (e.g., drag conjugate,<br>
noncovalent drag conjugate, drug fusion) can be determined using any suitable method<br>
before lyophilization, and the activity can be determined using the same method after<br>
rehydration to determine amount of lost activity.<br>
Compositions containing the drug composition (e.g., drag conjugate,<br>
noncovalent drug conjugate, drug fusion) or a cocktail thereof can be administered for<br>
prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatments. In certain therapeutic applications, an<br><br>
WO 2006/059106	PCT/GB2005/004599<br>
-75-<br>
amount sufficient to achieve the desired therapeutic or prophylactic effect, under the<br>
conditions of administration, such as at least partial inhibition, suppression, modulation,<br>
killing, or some other measurable parameter, of a population of selected cells is denned<br>
as a "therapeutically-effective amount or dose." Amounts needed to achieve this dosage<br>
will depend upon the severity of the disease and the general state of the patient's own<br>
immune system and general health, but generally range from about 10 ug/kg to about 80<br>
mg/kg, or about 0.005 to 5.0 mg of drug conjugate or drug fusion per kilogram of body<br>
weight, with doses of 0.05 to 2.0 mg/kg/dose being more commonly used. For example,<br>
a drug composition (e.g., drug fusion, drug conjugate, noncovalent drug conjugate) of<br>
the invention can be administered daily (e.g., up to four administrations per day), every<br>
two days, every three days, twice weekly, once weekly, once every two weeks, once a<br>
month, or once every two months, at a dose of, for example, about 10 l-ig/kg to about 80<br>
mg/kg, about 100 ug/kg to about 80 mg/kg, about 1 mg/kg to about 80 mg/kg, about 1<br>
mg/kg to about 70 mg/kg, about 1 mg/kg to about 60 mg/kg, about 1 mg/kg to about 50<br>
mg/kg, about 1 mg/kg to about 40 mg/kg, about 1 mg/kg to about 30 mg/kg, about 1<br>
mg/kg to about 20 mg/kg , about 1 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg, about 10 ug/kg to about<br>
10 mg/kg, about 10 ug/kg to about 5 mg/kg, about 10 ug/kg to about 2.5 mg/kg, about 1<br>
mg/kg, about 2 mg/kg, about 3 mg/kg, about 4 mg/kg, about 5 mg/kg, about 6 mg/kg,<br>
about 7 mg/kg, about 8 mg/kg, about 9 mg/kg or about 10 mg/kg.<br>
For prophylactic applications, compositions containing the drug composition (e.g., drug<br>
conjugate, noncovalent drug conjugate, drug fusion) or cocktails thereof may also be<br>
administered in similar or slightly lower dosages. A composition containing a drug<br>
composition (e.g., drug conjugate, noncovalent drug conjugate, drug fusion) according<br>
to the present invention may be utilised in prophylactic and therapeutic settings to aid in<br>
the alteration, inactivation, killing or removal of a select target cell population in a<br>
mammal.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (ILl-ra) is an antagonist that blocks the<br>
biologic activity of IL-1 by competitively inhibiting IL-1 binding to the interleukin-1<br>
type 1 receptor (IL-1R1). IL-1 production is induced in response to inflammatory<br>
stimuli and mediates various physiologic responses including inflammatory and<br><br>
WO 2006/059106	PCT/GB2005/004599<br>
-76-<br>
imrnunological responses. IL-1 has a range of activities including cartilage degredation<br>
and stimulation of bone resorption. In rheumatoid arthritis patients, the amount of<br>
locally produed IL-1 is elevated and the levels of naturally occurring ILl-ra are<br>
insufficient to compete with these abnormally increased amounts. There are several<br>
treatments avavilable for RA including disease modifying antirheumatic drugs<br>
(DMARDS) such as methotrexate, and biologies such as KTNERETÂ® (anakinra,<br>
Amgen).<br>
KINERETÂ® (anakinra, Amgen) is a recombinant, nonglycosylated form of the<br>
human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist which consists of 153 amino acids and has a<br>
molecular weight of 17.3 kilodaltons. (The amino acid sequence of KINERETÂ®<br>
(anakinra, Amgen) corresponds to the 152 amino acids in naturally occurring IL-lra and<br>
an additional N-terminal methionine.) KINERETÂ® (anakinra, Amgen) is indicated for<br>
the reduction in signs and symptoms of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis in<br>
patients 18 years of age or older who have failed one or more DMARDs. Dosage is a<br>
single use daily subcutaneous injection of l00mgs of drug. The T1./2 is 4-6 hours and<br>
71% of patients develop injection site reactions in 14-28 days.<br>
Here we demonstrate that linking a therapeutic polypeptide to a serum-albumin<br>
binding dAb results in a compound which (i) has activity similar to the therapeutic<br>
polypeptide alone and (ii) also binds serum albumin. Furthermore, the present invention<br>
provides a method to create a long serum half-life version of the therapeutic<br>
polypeptide. For example, we have linked a serum albumin binding dAb to ILl-ra<br>
which results in a compound of longer serum half life than ILl-ra alone.<br>
Example 1 Selection of domain antibodies that bind mouse, rat and human serum<br>
albumin<br>
This example explains a method for making a single domain antibody (dAb)<br>
directed against serum albumin. Selection of dAbs against mouse serum albumin<br>
(MSA), human serum albumin (HSA) and rat serum albumin (RSA) is described.<br>
The dAbs against mouse serum albumin were selected as described in WO<br>
2004/003019 A2. Three human phage display antibody libraries were used. Each<br>
library was based on a single human framework for VH (V3-23/DP47 and JH4b) or VK<br><br>

The VH and VK libraries had been preselected for binding to generic ligands protein A<br>
and protein L respectively so that the majority of clones in the selected libraries were<br>
functional. The sizes of the libraries shown above correspond to the sizes after<br>
preselection.<br>
Two rounds of selection were performed on serum albumin using each of the<br>
libraries separately. For each selection, antigen was coated on immunotube (nunc) in 4<br>
mL of PBS at a concentration of 100 fig/ml. In the first round of selection, each of the<br>
three libraries was panned separately against HSA (Sigma) or MSA (Sigma). In the<br>
second round of selection, phage from each of the six first round selections was panned<br>
against (i) the same antigen again (eg 1st round MSA, 2nd round MSA) and (ii) against<br>
the reciprocal antigen (eg 1st round MSA, 2nd round HSA) resulting in a total of twelve<br>
2nd round selections. In each case, after the second round of selection 48 clones were<br>
tested for binding to HSA and MSA. Soluble dAb fragments were produced as<br>
described for scFv fragments by Harrison et al, Methods Enzymol. 1996; 267: 83-109<br>
and standard ELISA protocol was followed (Hoogenboom et al. (1991) Nucleic Acids<br>
Res., 19: 4133) except that 2% tween PBS was used as a blocking buffer and bound<br><br>
WO 2006/059106	PCT/GB2005/004599<br>
-78-<br>
dAbs were detected with either protein L-HRP (Sigma) (for the VKS) and protein A-<br>
HRP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (for the VHS).<br>
dAbs that gave a signal above background indicating binding to MSA, HSA or<br>
both were tested in ELISA insoluble form for binding to plastic alone but all were<br>
specific for serum albumin. Clones were then sequenced (see Table 1) revealing that 21<br>
unique dAb sequences had been identified. The minimum similarity (at the amino acid<br>
level) between the V/c dAb clones selected was 86.25% ((69/80) XI00; the result when<br>
all the diversified residues are different, e.g., clones 24 and 34). The minimum<br>
similarity between the VH dAb clones selected was 94 % ((127/136) X100).<br>
Next, the serum albumin binding dAbs were tested for their ability to capture<br>
biotinylated antigen from solution. ELISA protocol (as above) was followed except that<br>
ELISA plate was coated with 1 jug/ml protein L (for the VK clones) and 1 jug/ml protein<br>
A (for the VH clones). Soluble dAb was captured from solution as in the protocol and<br>
detection was with biotinylated MSA or HSA and streptavidin HRP. The biotinylated<br>
MSA and HSA had been prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions, with the<br>
aim of achieving an average of 2 biotins per serum albumin molecule. Twenty four<br>
clones were identified that captured biotinylated MSA from solution in the ELISA. Two<br>
of these (clones 2 and 38 below) also captured biotinylated HSA. Next, the dAbs were<br>
tested for their ability to bind MSA coated on a CM5 Biacore chip. Eight clones were<br>
found that bound MSA on the Biacore.<br>
dAbs against human serum albumin and rat serum albumin were selected as<br>
previously described for the anti-MSA dAbs except for the following modifications to<br>
the protocol: The phage library of synthetic VH domains was the libray 4G, which is<br>
based on a human VH3 comprising the DP47 germline gene and the JH4 segment. The<br>
diversity at the following specific positions was introduced by mutagenesis (using NNK<br>
codons; numbering according to Kabat) in CDR1: 30, 31, 33, 35; in CDR2: 50, 52, 52a,<br>
53, 55, 56; and in CDR3: 4-12 diversified residues: e.g. H95, H96, H97, and H98 in 4G<br>
HI 1 and H95, H96, H97, H98, H99, H100, Hl00a, Hl00b, Hl00c, Hl00d, Hl00e and<br>
Hl00f in 4G H19. The last three CDR3 residues are FDY so CDR3 lengths vary from 7-<br>
15 residues. The library comprises &gt;lxl010 individual clones.<br>
A subset of the VH and Vk libraries had been preselected for binding to generic<br>
ligands protein A and protein L respectively so that the majority of clones in the<br><br>
WO 2006/059106	PCT/GB2005/004599<br>
-79-<br>
unselected libraries were functional. The sizes of the libraries shown above correspond<br>
to the sizes after preselection.<br>
Two rounds of selection were performed on rat and human serum albumin using<br>
subsets of the VH and Vk libraries separately. For each selection, antigen was either (i)<br>
coated on immunotube (nunc) in 4ml of PBS at a concentration of 100Î¼g/ml, or (ii)<br>
bitotinylated and then used for soluble selection followed by capture on streptavidin<br>
beads (in the 1st round) and neutravidin beads (in the 2nd round). (See Table 1 for<br>
details of the selection strategy used to isolate each clone.) In each case, after the<br>
second round of selection 24 phage clones were tested for binding to HS A or RS A.<br>
If a significant proportion of the clones in one of the selections were positive in<br>
the phage ELISA, then DNA from this selection was cloned into an expression vector<br>
for production of soluble dAb, and individual colonies were picked. Soluble dAb<br>
fragments were produced as described for scFv fragments by Harrison et al (Methods<br>
Enzymol. 1996;267:83-109) and standard ELISA protocol was followed (Hoogenboom<br>
et al. (1991) Nucleic Acids Res., 19: 4133) except that 2% TWEEN PBS was used as a<br>
blocking buffer and bound dAbs were detected with anti-myc-HRP . Clones that were<br>
positive in ELISA were then screened for binding to MSA, RSA or HSA using a<br>
BIACORE surface plasmon resonance instrument (Biacore AB). dAbs which bound to<br>
MSA, RSA or HSA were further analysed. Clones were then sequenced and unique<br>
dAb sequences identified.<br>

dAbs that bound serum albumin on a BIACORE chip (Biacore AB) were then<br>
further analysed to obtain information on affinity. The analysis was performed using a<br>
CM5 chip (carboxymethylated dextran matix) that was coated with serum albumin.<br>
Flow cell 1 was an uncoated, blocked negative control, flow cell 2 was coated with<br>
HSA, flow cell 3 was coated with RSA and flow cell 4 was coated with MSA. The<br>
serum albumins were immobilised in acetate buffer pH 5.5 using the BIACORE coating<br>
wizard which was programmed to aim for 500 resonance units (RUs) of coated material.<br>
Each dAb of interest was expressed in the periplasm of E. coli on a 200 mL-500 mL<br>
scale and purified from the supernatant using batch absorption to protein A-streamline<br>
affinity resin (Amersham, UK) for the VHS and to protein L-agarose affinity resin<br>
(Affitech, Norway) for the VKs followed by elution with glycine at pH 2.2 and buffer<br>
exchange to PBS. A range of concentrations of dAb were prepared (in the range 5nM to<br>
5/xM) by dilution into BIACORE HBS-EP buffer and flowed across the BIACORE<br>
chip.<br>
Affinity (KD) was calculated from the BIACORE traces by fitting on-rate and<br>
off-rate curves to traces generated by concentrations of dAb in the region of the KD.<br>
dAbs with a range of different affinities to serum albumin were identified. Included in<br>
the range 10-100nM, were the affinities of DOM7h-8 for HSA, DOM7h-2 for HSA and<br>
DOM7r-l for RSA. Included in the range l00nM to 500nM were the affinities of<br>
DOM7h-7 for HSA, DOM7h-8 for RSA and DOM7h-26 for HSA. Included in the<br>
range 500nM to 5Î¼M were the affinities of DOM7h-23 for HSA and DOM7h-l for<br>
HSA. Example traces are included in FIGS. 6A-6C.<br>
Example 2. Formatting anti-serum albumin antibodies as a fusion with IL-1 receptor<br>
antagonist (IL-lra)<br>
This example describes a method for making a fusion protein comprising IL-lra<br>
and a dAb that binds to serum albumin. Two fusions were made, one with the dAb N-<br>
terminal of the IL-lra (MSA16ILl-ra) and one with the dAb C-terminal of the IL-lra<br>
(ILl-raMSA 16). The sequences of the fusions and the vector are shown in FIG. 2C and<br><br>
WO 2006/059106	PCT/GB2005/004599<br>
-82-<br>
2D. A control fusion that did not bind MSA was also produced, and its sequence is<br>
shown in FIG. 2E.<br>
KINERET (anakinra, Amgen) has a short half life of 4-6 hours, and the<br>
recommended dosing regime calls for daily injections. This regime lead to injection site<br>
reaction in 14-28 days in 71% of cases. Therefore a form of human IL-lra that has a<br>
longer serum half life would be beneficially and could increase efficacy and reduce<br>
dosing frequency. These are both desirable properties for a pharmaceutical.<br>
Cloning<br>
Briefly, two multiple cloning sites (MCSs) were designed as detailed below and<br>
inserted into an expression vector with a T7 promotor. The restriction sites were<br>
designed for the insertion of ILl-ra, dAb, GAS leader and linker. One (MCS 1+3)<br>
encodes a protein with the dAb N terminal of the IL-lra and the other (MCS 2 + 4)<br>
encode a protein with the dAb C terminal of the IL-lra.<br>

The GAS leader was then inserted into each vector by digesting the MCS using<br>
the appropriate restriction enzymes and ligating annealed primers coding for the leader.<br>
Next, linker DNA coding for the linker was inserted in a similar manner. DNA coding<br>
for IL-lra was obtained by PCR (using primers designed to add the required restriction<br>
sites) from a cDNA clone and inserted into a TOPO cloning vector. After confirming<br><br>
WO 2006/059106	PCT/GB2005/004599<br>
-83-<br>
the correct sequence by nucleic acid sequencing, DNA coding for IL-lra was excised<br>
from the TOPO vector and ligated into the vectors containing leader and linker. Lastly,<br>
DNA coding for the dAb was excised from the dAb expression vector and inserted into<br>
the vectors by Sall/NotI digest of insert (purified by gel purification) and vector.<br>
Expression and purification<br>
MSA16ILl-ra, ILl-raMSA16 and dummylL-lra were expressed in the<br>
periplasm of E. coli and purified from the supernatant using batch absorbtion to protein<br>
L-agarose affinity resin (Affitech, Norway) followed by elution with glycine at pH 2.2.<br>
The purified dAbs were then analysed by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis followed by<br>
coomassie staining. For one of the proteins (IL-lraMSA 16), &gt; 90% of the protein was<br>
of the expected size and therefore was analysed for activity without further purification.<br>
The other proteins (MSA16ELl-ra and dummy IL-lra) were contaminated by a smaller<br>
band and were therefore further purified by FPLC ion exchange chromatography on the<br>
RESOURSEQ ion exchange column at pH 9. Protein was eluted using a linear salt<br>
gradient form 0-500 mM NaCl. After analysis by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis,<br>
fractions containing a protein of the expected size were combined yielding a combined<br>
fraction of &gt;90% purity. This protein was used for further analysis<br>
Example 3. Determination of activity of dAb ILl-ra fusion in vitro<br>
MRC-5 IL-8 assay<br>
MSA16IL-lra fusions were tested for the ability to neutralise the induction of<br>
IL-8 secretion by IL-1 in MRC-5 cells (ATCC Accession No. CCL-171; American<br>
Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA). The method is adapted from Akeson, L. et al<br>
(1996) Journal of Biological Chemistry 271,30517-30523, which describes the<br>
induction of IL-8 by IL-1 in HUVEC, MRC-5 cells were used instead of the HUVEC<br>
cell line. Briefly, MRC-5 cells plated in microtitre plates were incubated overnight with<br>
dAblL-lra fusion proteins or IL-lra control, and IL-1 (100 pg/mL). Post incubation the<br>
supernatant was aspirated off the cells and IL-8 concentration measured via a sandwich<br>
ELISA (R&amp;D Systems).<br>
The activity of IL-lra in the fusion proteins led to a reduction in IL-8 secretion.<br>
The reduction of IL-8 secretion resulting from activity of the MSA16ILl-ra fusion and<br><br>
WO 2006/059106	PCT/GB2005/004599<br>
-84-<br>
from activity of the IL-lraMSA16 fusion was compared to the reduction seen with the<br>
IL-lra control (recombinant human IL-lra, R&amp;D systems). The neutralizing dose 50<br>
(ND50) of each of the tested proteins was determined and is presented in Table 2.<br>
Table 2<br><br>
Protein	ND50<br>
IL-lra	0.5 nM<br>
MSA16EL-lra	2nM<br>
IL-lraMSA16	8nM<br>
The results demonstrate that IL-lra remained active as part of a fusion construct<br>
with an anti-serum albumin dAb. The MSA16IL-lra protein was further studied to<br>
assess its pharmacokinetics (PK study).<br>
Serum Albumin, anti IL-lra sandwich ELISA<br>
Three dAb/IL-lra fusions were tested for the ability to bind serum albumin and<br>
simultaneously be detected by a monoclonal anti-ILlra antibody. The fusions tested<br>
were MSA16IL-lra, IL-lraMSA16 and dummylL-lra. Briefly, ELISA plate was coated<br>
overnight with mouse serum albumin at 10 Î¼g/ml, washed 5 x with 0.05% Tween PBS<br>
and then blocked for 1 hour with 4% Marvel PBS. After blocking, the plate was washed<br>
5 x with 0.05% Tween PBS and then incubated for 1 hour with each dAb, Il-lra fusion<br>
diluted in 4% MPBS. Each fusion was incubated at 1 Î¼M concentration and at 7<br>
sequential 4-fold dilutions (ie down to 60pM). After the incubation, plates were washed<br>
5 x with 0.05% Tween PBS and then incubated for 1 hour with the manufacturers<br>
recommended dilution of a rabbit polyclonal antibody (ab-2573) to human IL-1 receptor<br>
antagonist (Abeam, UK) diluted in 4% MPBS. After this incubation, plates were<br>
washed 5 x with 0.05% Tween PBS and then incubated for lh with a 1/2000 dilution of<br>
secondary antibody (anti-rabbit IgG-HRP) diluted in 4% MPBS. Following incubation<br>
with the secondary antibody, plates were washed 3 x with 0.05% Tween PBS and 2 x<br>
with PBS and then developed with 50/il per well of TMB microwell peroxidase<br>
substrate (KPL, MA) and the reaction stopped with 50 Î¼l per well of HCL. Absorption<br>
was read at 450 nM.<br><br>
WO 2006/059106	PCT/GB2005/004599<br>
-85-<br>
Both the MSA16IL-lra and IL-lraMSA16 proteins were detected at more than 2<br>
x background level at 1 /iM concentration in the sandwich ELISA. The MSA16IL-lra<br>
protein was detected at 2 x background or higher at dilutions down to 3.9 nM, whereas<br>
the IL-lraMSA16 protein was detected at 2 x background only down to 500 nM.<br>
Binding of the MSA16IL-lra fusion to serum albumin was shown to be specific for<br>
serum albumin as the control construct (dummylL-lra) did not bind serum albumin.<br>
Example 4. Determination of serum half life of drug fusions in mouse PK studies.<br>
A. Determination of the serum half-life in mouse of a MSA binding dAb/HA<br>
epitope tag fusion protein.<br>
The MSA binding dAb/HA epitope tag fusion protein was expressed in the<br>
periplasm of E. coli and purified using batch absorption to protein L-agarose affinity<br>
resin (Affitech, Norway) followed by elution with glycine at pH 2.2. Serum half life of<br>
the fusion protein was determined in mouse following a single intravenous (i.v.)<br>
injection at approx 1.5 mg/kg into CD1 strain male animals. Analysis of serum levels<br>
was by ELISA using goat anti-HA (Abeam, UK) capture and protein L-HRP<br>
(Invitrogen, USA) detection which was blocked with 4% Marvel. Washing was with<br>
0.05% Tween-20, PBS. Standard curves of known concentrations of MSA binding<br>
dAb/HA fusion were set up in the presence of lx mouse serum to ensure comparability<br>
with the test samples. Modelling with a 1 compartment model (WinNonlin Software,<br>
Pharsight Corp., USA) showed the MSA binding dAb/HA epitope tag fusion protein<br>
had a terminal phase tl/2 of 29.1 hours and an area under the curve of 559 hr.ug/ml.<br>
This demonstrates a large improvement over the predicted half life for a HA epitope tag<br>
peptide alone which could be a short as only several minutes.<br>
The results of this study using the HA epitope tag as a drug model, demonstrate<br>
that the in vivo serum half life of a drug can be extended when the drug is prepared as a<br>
drug fusion or drug conjugate with an antigen-binding fragment of (e.g., dAb) of an<br>
antibody that binds serum albumin.<br>
The in vivo half life in mice of the anti-MSA dAbs DOM7m-16 and D0M7m-<br>
26, and a control dAb that does not bind MSA were also assessed. Again, DOM7m-16,<br>
DOM7m-26 and the control dAb contained an HA epitope tag, which serves as a model<br><br>
WO 2006/059106	PCT/GB2005/004599<br>
-86-<br>
for a drag (e.g., a peptide drag). In this study, the control dAb, that does not bind MSA,<br>
had an in vivo half life of 20 minutes, whereas the in vivo half lives of DOM7m-16 and<br>
DOM7m-26 were significantly extended. (FIG. 12) DOM7m-16 was found to have an<br>
in vivo half life in mice of 29.5 hours in further studies.<br>
In another study, the in vivo half life (t1/2 Î²) of DOM7h-8 which contained an<br>
HA epitope tag was evaluated in mice. Modelling with a 2 compartment model<br>
(WinNonlin Software, Pharsight Corp., USA) showed that DOM7h-8 had a tl/2/3 of<br>
29.1 hours.<br>
The results of each of these study using the HA epitope tag as a model for a drag<br>
{e.g., a peptide drag), demonstrate that the in vivo serum half life of a drug can be<br>
dramatically extended when the drag is prepared as a drag fusion or drag conjugate with<br>
an antigen-binding fragment of (e.g., dAb) of an antibody that binds serum albumin.<br>
B. Determination of the serum half-life in mouse of MSA binding dAb/IL-lra<br>
fusion protein.<br>
The MSA binding dAb/IL-lra fusion protein (MSA16IL-lra) was expressed in<br>
the periplasm of E. coli and purified using batch absorption to protein L-agarose affinity<br>
resin (Affitech, Norway) followed by elution with glycine at pH 2.2. Serum half life of<br>
the MSA16IL-lra (DOM7m-16/IL-lra), an IL-lra fusion with a dAb that does not bind<br>
MSA (Dummy dAb/IL-lra), and an anti-MSA dAb fused to the HA epitope tag<br>
(DOM7m-16 HA tag) was determined in mice following a single i.v. injection at<br>
approximately 1.5 mg/kg into CD1 strain male animals.<br>
Analysis of serum levels was by Il-lra sandwich ELISA (R&amp;D Systems, USA).<br>
Standard curves of known concentrations of dAb/IL-lra fusion were set up in the<br>
presence of lx mouse serum to ensure comparability with the test samples. Modelling<br>
was performed using the WinNonlin pharmacokinetics software (Pharsight Corp.,<br>
USA).<br>
It was expected that the IL-lra fusion with the anti-MSA dAb would increase<br>
the serum half-life considerably when compared with the control which was a fusion of<br>
a non-MSA binding dAb with IL-lra. The control non-MSA binding dAb/IL-lra fusion<br>
was predicted to have a short serum half-life.<br><br>
WO 2006/059106	PCT/GB2005/004599<br>
-87-<br>
The results of the study are presented in Table 3, and show that the IL-lra fusion<br>
with anti-MSA dAb (DOM7m-16/IL-lra had a serum half life that was about 10 times<br>
longer than the IL-lra fusion with a dAb that does not bind MSA (Dummy dAb/IL-lra).<br>
The results also revealed that there was a &gt; 200 fold improvement (increase) in the area<br>
under the concentration time curve for DOM7m-16/IL-lra (AUC: 267 hr.ug/ml) as<br>
compared to dummy/IL-lra (AUC: 1.5 hr.ug/ml)<br>

Agent	Serum Half Life<br>
DOM7m-16/IL-lra	4.3 hours<br>
dummy/IL-lra	0.4 hours<br>
DOM7m-16HAtag	29 hours<br>
The results of these studies demonstrate that the in vivo serum half life and AUC<br>
of a drug can be significantly extended when the drug is prepared as a drug fusion or<br>
drug conjugate with an antigen-binding fragment of (e.g., dAb) of an antibody that<br>
binds serum albumin.<br>
Example 5. Determination of the serum half-life in rats of RSA binding dAb/HA<br>
epitope tag fusion proteins.<br>
Anti-rat serum albumin dAbs were expressed with C-terminal HA tags in the<br>
periplasm of E. coli and purified using batch absorption to protein L-agarose affinity<br>
resin (Affitech, Norway) for Vk dAbs and batch absorption to protein A affinity resin<br>
for VH dAbs, followed by elution with glycine at pH 2.2. In order to determine serum<br>
half life, groups of 4 rats were given a single i.v. injection at 1.5 mg/Kg of DOM7r-27,<br>
DOM7r-31, DOM7r-16, DOM7r-3 or a control dAb (HEL4) that binds an irrelevant<br>
antigen. Serum samples were obtained by serial bleeds from a tail vein over a 7 day<br>
period and analyzed by sandwich ELISA using goat anti-HA (Abeam, Cambridge UK)<br>
coated on an ELISA plate, followed by detection with protein A-HRP (for the VH dAbs)<br>
or protein L-HRP (for VK dAbs). Standard curves of known concentrations of dAb<br>
were set up in the presence of lx rat serum to ensure comparability with the test<br><br>
WO 2006/059106	PCT/GB2005/004599<br>
-88-<br>
samples. Modelling with a 2 compartment model (using WinNonlin pharmacokinetics<br>
software (Pharsight Corp., USA)) was used to calculate 11/2/3 and area under the curve<br>
(AUC) (Table 4).<br>
Table 4<br><br>
Agent	Scaffold	Affmtity (KD) for rat serumalbumin	tl/2/Î²	AUC(Î¼,g.hr/mL)<br>

DOM7r-16	Vk	1 Î¼M	34.4 hours	170<br>
DOM7r-27	VH	250 nM	14.8 hours	78.9<br>
DOM7r-31	VH	5Î²M	5.96 hours	71.2<br>
The results of this rat study using the HA epitope tag as a model for a drug (e.g.,<br>
apeptide drug), demonstrate that the in vivo serum half life of a drug can be<br>
dramatically extended when the drug is prepared as a drug fusion or drug conjugate with<br>
an antigen-binding fragment of (e.g., dAb) of an antibody that binds serum albumin.<br>
Prediction of half life in humans.<br>
The in vivo half life of a dAb, drug fusion or drug conjugate in humans can<br>
estimated from half life data obtained in animals using allometric scaling. The log of<br>
the in vivo half lifes determined in 3 animals is plotted against the log of the weight of<br>
the animal. A line is drawn through the plotted points and the slope and y-intercept of<br>
the line are used to calculate the in vivo half life in humas using the formula log Y =<br>
log(a) + b log(W), in which Y is the in vivo half life in humans, log(a) is the y-intercept,<br>
b is the slope, and W is the weight of a human. The line can be produced using in vivo<br>
half life data obtain in animals that weigh about 35 grams (e.g., mice), about 260 grams<br>
(e.g., rats) and about 2,710 grams. For this calculation, the weight of a human can be<br>
considered to be 70,000 grams.<br><br>

Example 6. Efficacy of anti-SA dAb/IL-lra drag fusion in mouse collagen induced<br>
arthritis model of rheumatoid arthritis.<br>
Efficacy of the fusion DOM7m-16/IL-lra and efficacy of IL-lra in a recognized<br>
mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis (type II collagen induced arthritis (CIA) in DBA/1<br>
mice) was assessed. Throughout the study, mice were maintained in a test facility in<br>
standard type 2 cages that were housed in a HEPA-filtered Scantainer at 20-24Â°C with a<br>
12-hours light, 12-hours dark cycle. Food (Harlan-Teklad universal diet 2016) and UV<br>
sterilized water were provided ad libitum. The mice were imported to the test facility at<br>
least 7 days before the start the study to assure proper acclimitization.<br>
DBA/1 mice at 7-8 weeks of age (obtained from Taconic M and B, Domholtveg,<br>
Denmark) were injected once with an emulsion of Arthrogen-CIA adjuvant and<br>
Arthrogen-CIA collagen (both MD biosciences) emulsified at a 1:1 ratio until the<br>
emulsion was stable. The emulsion was considered to be stable when a drop of the<br>
emulsion added to a beaker of water formed a solid clump. The mice were then injected<br>
with the emulsion.<br>
Twenty-one days after the emulsion was injected, the 20 animals with the most<br>
advanced arthritic disease were eliminated from the study, and the remaining mice were<br>
divided into groups of 10 animals (each group contained 5 males and 5 females). The<br>
mice were treated as shown in Table 5, and all treatments were delivered at a<br>
concentration calculated so that 10 ml/Kg were administered.<br>

Clinical scores for the severity of arthritis were recorded 3 times a week from<br>
day 21 to day 49. Mice were euthanized at day 49. Individual mice were euthanized<br>
earlier if they presented an arthritic score of 12 or more, or had serious problems<br>
moving.<br>
For clinical scoring, each limb was scored according to the criteria below and<br>
the scores for all four limbs were added to produce the total score for the mouse. This<br>
method resulted is a score of 0 to 16 for each mouse. Scoring critera were: 0 = normal;<br>
1 = mild but definite redness and swelling of the ankle or wrist, or apparent redness and<br>
swelling limited to individual digits, regardless of the number of affected digits; 2 =<br>
moderate redness and swelling of ankle and wrist; 3 = severe redness and swelling of<br>
the entire paw including digits; 4 = maximally inflamed limb with involvement of<br>
multiple joints.<br>
Group average arthritic scores were calculated for each treatment group on every<br>
treatment day using clinical scores from individual mice. Any animals that had been<br>
removed from the study for ethical reasons were allocated the maximum score of 16.<br>
The group average arthritic scores were plotted against time (FIG. 13).<br>
Statistical analysis of the group average arthritic scores on day 49 were<br>
performed using the Wilcoxon test. This statistical analysis revealed that the two<br>
groups treated with DOM7m-16/IL-lra (at 1 mg/Kg or 10 mg/Kg (Groups 3 and 4)) had<br>
significantly improved arthtritic scores at day 49 (at the P 
significance levels respectively) when compared to the saline control group (Group 6).<br>
In contrast, treatment with IL-lra at 1 mg/Kg (Group 1) did not result in statistically<br>
significant improvement in the arthritic score at day 49, while treatment with IL-lra at<br>
10 mg/Kg (Group 2) resulted in a significant improvement at the P 
level. Treatment with ENBRELÂ® (entarecept; Immunex Corporation) (Group 5)<br>
resulted in significant improvement in the arthric score at day 49 at the P 
significance level.<br>
Treatment with DOM7m-16/IL-lra at the 10 mg/Kg dose (Group 4), was<br>
effective at improving the arthtritic score at day 49 (significant at the P
when compared to standard treatment with ENBRELÂ® (entarecept; Immunex<br>
Corporation) at 5mg/Kg (Group 5). In addition, treatment with DOM7m-16/IL-lra at<br>
the lower lmg/Kg dose (Group 3), was more efficacious at improving the arthtritic<br><br>

score at day 49 than treatment with IL-lra alone at the same dosage (Group 1)<br>
(significant at the P
The results of the study show that at certain doses DOM7m-16/IL-lra was more<br>
effective than IL-lra or ENBRELÂ® (entarecept; Immunex Corporation) in this study.<br>
The response to IL-lra was dose dependant, as expected, and the response to D0M7m-<br>
16/TL-lra was also dose dependant. The average scores for treatment with D0M7m-<br>
16/IL-lra at lmg/Kg were consistently lower than the average scores obtained by<br>
treatment with IL-lra at 10 mg/kg. These plotted results (FIG. 13) indicate that<br>
treatment with DOM7m-16/IL-lra was about 10 times more effective than IL-lra in this<br>
study.<br>
This superior efficacy of DOM7m-16/IL-lra was observed even though the<br>
DOM7-16/IL-lra fusion protein contains about half the number of IL-1 receptor binding<br>
epitopes as IL-lra on a weight basis (e.g., 1 mg of DOM7m-16/IL-lra (MW .31.2 kD)<br>
contains about half the number of IL-1 receptor binding epitopes as 1 mg of IL-lra<br>
(MW. 17.1 kD).<br>
The results of this study demonstrate that a dAb that binds serum albumin can be<br>
linked to IL-lra (a clinically proven therapy for RA) and that the resulting drug fusion<br>
has both long serum half life properties (conferred by the dAb) and IL-1 receptor<br>
binding properties (conferred by the IL-lra). Due to the serum residence time of the<br>
drug fusion, the dose of DOM7-16/IL-lra that was effective for treating CIA was<br>
dramatically reduced relative to IL-lra.<br>
The results of this study demonstrate that in addition to the benefits of extended<br>
half life and increased AUC, drugs prepared as drug fusions or drug conjugates with an<br>
antigen-binding fragment of (e.g., dAb) of an antibody that binds serum albumin are<br>
highly effective therapeutic agents that provide advantages over drug alone. For<br>
example, as demonstrated in the mouse CIA model, a lower dose of drug fusion was<br>
effective and inhibited the joint inflammation and joint damage caused by IL-1 over a<br>
longer period of time in comparison to IL-lra alone, and provided greater protection<br>
against disease progression.<br>
Example 7. Anti-SA dAb/Saporin noncovalent drug conjugate<br><br>
WO 2006/059106	PCT/GB2005/004599<br>
-92-<br>
The ribosome-inactivating protein Saporin (an anti-cancer drug) is highly stable<br>
to denaturants and proteases and has been used as a targeted toxin to T lymphocytes. A<br>
non-covalent drug conjugate was prepared by coupling Saporin to DOM7h-8 via a<br>
biotin-streptavidin link. Results obtained with this non-covalent drug conjugate<br>
demonstrates that the DOM7h-8 retains its serum albumin binding characteristics when<br>
coupled to a drug.<br>
A variant DOM7h-8 referred to as DOM7h-8cys, in which the C-terminal<br>
arginine at position 108 (amino acid 108 of SEQ ID NO: 24) was replaced with a<br>
cysteine residue was prepared by expression of a recombinant nucleic acid in HB2151<br>
cells. The cells were grown and induced at 30Â°C in overnight expression autoinduction<br>
TB readymix (Merck KGa, Germany) for 72 hours before recovery of the supernatant<br>
by centrifugation. DOM7h-8cys was purified from the supernatant using affinity<br>
capture on protein L-agarose. The resin was then washed with 10 column volumes of 2<br>
x PBS and DOM7h-8cys was eluted with 0.1 M glycine pH2. Eluted DOM7h-8cys was<br>
neutralised with 0.2 x volume of Tris pH8 and concentrated to lmg/ml (using a<br>
CENTRICON 20 ml concentrator (Millipore Corp., MA).<br>
Concentrated DOM7h-8cys was buffer exchanged to PBS using a NAP5<br>
desalting column (GE Healthcare/Amersham Biosciences, NJ) and concentration<br>
determined. The dAb was then biotinylated (via primary amines) using EZ-LINK sulfo-<br>
NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce Biotechnology Inc., IL). The biotinylated dAb was mixed with<br>
streptavidin-saporin in a 1:1 molar ratio.<br>
In order to confirm that the dAb/saporin complex was formed, a sandwich<br>
ELISA was used to detect intact complexes. Human serum albumin (HAS) was coated<br>
onto half of the wells of an ELISA plate (Nunc, NY) overnight at 10 Î¼g/ml in a volume<br>
of 100 /il per well. After overnight incubation, the plate was washed 3 times with PBS,<br>
0.05% Tween and then the whole plate was blocked for 2 hours with 2% PBS. After<br>
blocking, the plate was washed 3 times with PBS, 0.05% Tween and then incubated for<br>
1 hour with DOM7h-8/saporin non-covalent conjugate diluted to 0.5 Î¼M. in 2% Tween<br>
PBS. As controls on the same ELISA plate, uncoupled saporin at 0.5 Î¼M and<br>
uncoupled DOM7h8 at 0.5 Î¼M were incubated in 2% Tween PBS. Additional controls<br>
were the same three diluted proteins incubated on wells of the ELISA plate not coated<br>
with HSA and blocked with 2% Tween. After the incubation, the plate was washed 3<br><br>

-93-<br>
times with PBS, 0.05% Tween and then incubated for 1 hour with 1/2000 dilution of<br>
goat anti-saporin polyclonal antibody (Advanced Therapeutic Systems) diluted in 2%<br>
Tween PBS. After the incubation, the plate was washed 3 times with PBS, 0.05%<br>
Tween and then incubated for 1 hour with the secondary detection antibody (of 1/2000<br>
anti-goat Ig HRP conjugate). After the incubation, the plate was washed 3 times with<br>
PBS, 0.05% Tween and once with PBS and tapped dry on paper. The ELISA was<br>
developed with 100 Î¼l 3, 3', 5, 5'-tetramethylbenzidine as substrate and the reaction<br>
stopped with 50 Î¼l 1M hydrochloric acid. The presence of non-covalent conjugates of<br>
DOM7h-8 and saporin was confirmed by comparing the OD600 of the conjugate with<br>
that of either of the unconjugated parts.<br>

The results of this study demonstrate that a drug can be conjugated to an<br>
antigen-binding fragement of an antibody that binds serum albumin, and that the<br>
conjugated antigen-binding fragment retains serum albumin-binding activity. In<br>
addition, due to the stability and strength of the biotin-streptavidin interation, the results<br>
show that covalently bonded and noncovalently bonded conjugates can be prepared that<br>
retain the serum albumin-binding activity of the antigen-binding fragment of an<br>
antibody that binds serum albumin.<br>
Example 8. Anti-SA dAb/Fluorescein conjugate<br>
Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) can be cross linked with amino, sulfhydryl,<br>
imidazoyl, tyrosyl or carbonyl groups on a protein. It has a molecular weight of 389 Da<br>
which is comparable in size to many small molecule drugs. Results obtained with this<br>
conjugate demonstrate that the anti-sa dAb maintains its serum albumin binding<br><br>

characteristics when coupled to a small chemical entity, and indicate that small<br>
molecule drugs can be conjugated to anti-SA dAbs.<br>
Concentrated DOM7h-8cys was prepared as described in Example 7. The<br>
concentrated dAb was buffer exchanged to 50 mM Borate pH 8 (coupling buffer) using<br>
a NAP5 desalting column (GE Healthcare/Amersham Biosciences, NJ) and then<br>
concentrated to 2.3 mg/ml using a 2 ml CENTRICON concentrator (Millipore Corp.,<br>
MA). The FITC (Pierce Biotechnology Inc.) was diluted to 10 mg/ml in dimethyl<br>
formamide (DMF) according to the manufacturer's instructions and then mixed with the<br>
dAb in coupling buffer at a molar ratio of 24:1 FITC:dAb. The reaction was allowed to<br>
proceed for 30 minutes. At this point, excess unreacted FITC was removed from the<br>
reaction using a PD10 desalting column (GE Healthcare/Amersham Biosciences, NJ)<br>
that was pre-equilibrated with PBS, and the DOM7h-8cys/FITC conjugate was eluted<br>
with PBS.<br>
In order to confirm that the FITC/dAb coupling reaction was successful, a<br>
sandwich ELISA was used to detect coupled dAb. Human serum albumin (HSA) was<br>
coated onto half of the wells of an ELISA plate (Nunc, NY) overnight at 10 Î¼g/ml in a<br>
volume of 100 Î¼l per well. After overnight incubation, the whole plate was washed 3<br>
times with PBS, 0.05% Tween and then all the wells were blocked for 2 hours with 2%<br>
Tween PBS. After blocking, the plate was washed 3 times with PBS, 0.05% Tween and<br>
then incubated for 1 hour with DOM7h-8cys/FITC diluted to 1 Î¼M in 2% Tween PBS.<br>
As controls on the same ELISA plate, a control FITC coupled antibody at 1 ÎM and<br>
uncoupled DOM7h-8 at 1 Î¼M were incubated in 2% Tween PBS. Additional controls<br>
were the same three diluted proteins incubated on wells of the ELISA plate not coated<br>
with HSA and blocked with 2% Tween. After the incubation, the plate was washed 3<br>
times with PBS, 0.05% Tween and then incubated for 1 hour with 1/500 dilution of rat<br>
anti FITC antibody (Serotec) diluted in 2% Tween PBS. After the incubation, the plate<br>
was washed 3 times with PBS, 0.05% Tween, and then incubated for 1 hour with the<br>
secondary detection antibody diluted in 2% Tween PBS (1/5000 anti-rat Ig HRP<br>
conjugate). After the incubation, the plate was washed 3 times with PBS, 0.05% Tween<br>
and once with PBS and tapped dry on paper. The ELISA was developed with 100 ul<br>
per well 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine as substrate and the reaction stopped with 50 ul<br>
per well 1M hydrochloric acid. The presence of conjugates of DOM7h-8 and FITC was<br><br>

Example 9. anti-SA dAb/peptide conjugates.<br>
Many peptides have therapeutic effects. Model peptides with an N or C terminal<br>
cysteine can be coupled to an anti-serum albumin dAb.<br>
In this case, four different peptides will be used: peptide 1<br>
YPYDVPDYAKKKKKECC (SEQ ID NO:68); peptide 2 CKKKKKKYPYDVPDYA<br>
(SEQ ID NO:69); peptide 3 HHHHHHKKKKKKC (SEQ ID NO:70) and peptide 4:<br>
CKKKKKKHHHHHH (SEQ ID NO:71). Peptides 1 and 2 include the sequence of the<br>
hemagglutinin tag (HA tag) and peptides 3 and 4 include the sequence of the His tag.<br>
Concentrated DOM7h-8cys will be prepared as described in Example 7.<br>
The concentrated dAb will be reduced with 5 mM dithiothreitol and then buffer<br>
exchanged to coupling buffer (20 mM BisTris pH 6.5, 5 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol)<br>
using a NAP5 desalting column (GE Healthcare/Amersham Biosciences, NJ). Cysteins<br>
will be blocked (to prevent the dAb dimerising with itself) using a final concentration of<br>
5 mM dithiodipyridine which will be added to the dAb solution form a stock of 100 mM<br>
dithiodipyridine in DMSO. The dAb and dithiodipyrdine will be left to couple for 20-<br>
30 minutes. Unreacted dithiodipyridine will then be removed using a PD10 desalting<br><br>

-96-<br>
column and the dAb will be eluted in coupling buffer (20 mM BisTris pH 6.5, 5 mM<br>
EDTA, 10% glycerol). The resulting protein will then be frozen until required.<br>
Peptides 1-4 will be individually dissolved in water at a concentration of 200<br>
Î¼M, will be reduced using 5 mM DTT and then will be desalted using a NAP5 desalting<br>
column (GE Healthcare/Amersham Biosciences, NJ). Each peptide will then be added<br>
to a solution of reduced and blocked dAb at a 20:1 ratio, for the peptide-dAb coupling<br>
to occur. In order to confirm success of the peptide, dAb coupling reactions, a sandwich<br>
ELISA will be used to detect anti-SA dAb/peptide conjugates.<br>
Human serum albumin will be coated onto an ELISA plate (Nunc, NY)<br>
overnight at 10 Î¼g/ml in a volume of 100 Î¼l per well. After overnight incubation, the<br>
plate will be washed 3 times with PBS, 0.05% Tween and then will be blocked for 2<br>
hours with 4% Marvel PBS. After blocking, the plate will be washed 3 times with PBS,<br>
0.05% Tween and then will be incubated for 1 hour with DOM7h-8/peptide conjugates<br>
diluted to 1 Î¼M in 4% Marvel PBS. As controls on the same ELISA plate, uncoupled<br>
peptide at 20 Î¼M and uncoupled DOM7h-8 at 1 Î¼M. will be incubated in 4% MPBS.<br>
After the incubation, the plate will be washed 3 times with PBS, 0.05% Tween and then<br>
will be incubated for 1 hour with 1/2000 dilution of goat anti-HA antibody (Abeam) for<br>
peptides 1 and 2, and a 1/2000 dilution of Ni NTA-HRP (for peptides 3 and 4) diluted<br>
in 4% Marvel PBS. After incubation, the plate will be washed 3 times with PBS, 0.05%<br>
Tween and the wells with the goat anti HA antibody will be incubated for lh with<br>
seconday anti-goat HRP antibody diluted 1/2000 in 4% MPBS (other wells were<br>
blocked for lh). After the incubation, the plate will be washed 3 times with PBS, 0.05%<br>
Tween and once with PBS and will then be tapped dry on paper. The ELISA will be<br>
developed with 3, 3', 5, 5'-tetramethylbenzidine as substrate and the reaction will be<br>
stopped with 1M hydrochloric acid. The presence of conjugates of DOM7h-8/peptide<br>
conjugate will be confirmed by comparing the OD600 of the conjugate with that of<br>
either of the unconjugated parts.<br><br>

The potency of an insulinotropic agent can be determined by calculating the<br>
EC50 value from the dose-response curve. Purified plasma membranes from a stable<br>
transfected cell line, BHK467-12A (tk-tsl3), expressing the human GLP-1 receptor will<br>
be stimulated with GLP-1 and peptide analogues, and the potency of cAMP production<br>
will be measured using the AlphaScreenâ¢ cAMP Assay Kit from Perkin Elmer Life<br>
Sciences.<br>
A stable transfected cell line will be prepared and a high expressing clone<br>
selected for screening. The cells will then be grown at 5% C02 in DMEM, 5% FCS, 1%<br>
Pen/Strep and 0. 5 mg/ml G418.<br>
Cells at approximate 80% confluence will be washed 2X with PBS and<br>
harvested with Versene, centrifuged 5 min at 1000 rpm and the supernatant removed.<br>
The additional steps will be made on ice. The cell pellet will be homogenized by the<br>
Ultrathurax for 20-30 sec. in 10 mi of Buffer 1 (20 mM Na-HEPES, 10 mM EDTA,<br>
pH7.4), centrifuged 15 min at 20.000 rpm and the pellet resuspended in 10 ml of Buffer<br>
2 (20 mM Na-HEPES, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH7.4). The suspension will be homogenized for<br>
20-30 sec and centrifuged 15 min at 20.000 rpm. Suspension in Buffer 2,<br>
homogenization and centrifugation will be repeated once and the membranes<br>
resuspended in Buffer 2 and ready for further analysis or stored at-80Â°C.<br>
The functional receptor assay will be carried out by measurering the peptide<br>
induced cAMP production by The AlphaScreen Technology. The basic principle of The<br>
AlphaScreen Technology is a competition between endogenous cAMP and exogenously<br>
added biotin-cAMP. The capture of cAMP is achieved by using a specific antibody<br>
conjugated to acceptor beads. Formed cAMP will be counted and measured with an<br>
AlphaFusion Microplate Analyzer. The EC50 values will be calculated using the Graph-<br>
Pad Prisme software.<br>
Resistance of a peptide to degradation by dipeptidyl aminopeptidase FV can be<br>
determined by the following degradation assay: Aliquots of the peptides will be<br>
incubated at 37 Â°C with an aliquot of purified dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV for 4-22<br>
hours in an appropriate buffer at pH 7-8 (buffer not being albumin). Enzymatic<br>
reactions will be terminated by the addition of trifluoroacetic acid, and the peptide<br>
degradation products will be separated and quantified using HPLC or LC-MS analysis.<br>
The mixtures will be applied onto a Zorbax 300SB-C18 (30 nm pores, 5 um particles)<br><br>

acetonitrile in 0. 1% trifluoroacetic acid (0%-100% acetonitrile over 30 min). Peptides<br>
and their degradation products may be monitored by their absorbance at 214 nm<br>
(peptide bonds) or 280 nm (aromatic amino acids), and will be quantified by integration<br>
of their peak areas. The degradation pattern can be determined by using LC-MS where<br>
MS spectra of the separated peak can be determined. Percentage intact/degraded<br>
compound at a given time is used for estimation of the peptides DPPIV stability.<br>
A peptide is defined as DPPFV stabilised when it is 10 times more stable than<br>
the natural peptide based on percentage intact compound at a given time. Thus, a<br>
DPPIV stabilised GLP-1 compound is at least 10 times more stable than GLP-1 (7-37).<br>
Stimulation of adenylate cyclase<br>
BRTN-BD11 cells will be seeded into 24-well plates (3xl05/well) and cultured<br>
for 48 h before being preincubated in media supplemented with tritiated adenine (2mCi)<br>
for 16 h. The cells will be washed twice with cold Hanks buffered saline (HBS) and test<br>
solution (400ul; 37C) added. The cells will then be exposed to varying concentrations<br>
(10-10-10-5 M) of GLP-1 compounds in HBS buffer, in the presence of lmM IBMX<br>
and 5.6mM glucose (20 min; 37C). Following incubation, test solutions will be removed<br>
and 300ul of lysis solution (5% TFA, 3% SDS, 5mM of unlabelled ATP, and 300 uM of<br>
unlabelled cAMP) added. Dowex and alumina exchange resins will be used to separate<br>
tritiated cAMP from tritiated adenine and ATP in the cell lysate, as described (Miguel<br>
JC, et al. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003, 65:283).<br>
Insulin secretory responses can be measured in the pancreatic /3-cell BRIN-<br>
BD11 cells. Cells will be seeded into 24-multiwell plates at a density of lxlO5/well, and<br>
allowed to attach during overnight culture. Acute studies of insulin release will be<br>
preceded by 40 min pre-incubation at 37C in 1.0 ml Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer<br>
(115mM NaCl, 4.7mM KC1, 1.28mM CaCl2-2H2O, 1.2mM KH2PO4, 1.2mM<br>
MgSO4H2O, l0mM NaHCO, and 5 g/L bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) supplemented<br>
with l.lmM glucose. Test incubations will be performed at 37C in the presence of<br>
5.6mM glucose with a range of concentrations of GLP-1 compounds (10-12-10-6 M).<br>
After 20 min incubation, the buffer will be removed from each well and aliquots stored<br>

Glucose-lowering and insulin secretory activity in obese diabetic (ob/ob) mice<br>
The in vivo biological activity of GLP-1 compounds can be assessed in 12-16<br>
week old obese diabetic (ob/ob) mice. The animals will be housed individually in an air-<br>
conditioned room at 22Â±2C with a 12 h light: 12 h dark cycle. Animals will be allowed<br>
drinking water ad libitum and continuous access to standard rodent maintenance diet.<br>
Mice will be fasted for 18 h and intraperitoneally administered 8 ml/kg body weight<br>
with saline (9 g/L NaCl), glucose alone (18mM/kg bodyweight), or in combination with<br>
a GLP-1 compound (25 nM/kg body weight). Blood samples will be collected into<br>
chilled fluoride/heparin microcentrifuge tubes immediately prior to injection and at 15,<br>
30, and 60 min post injection, and the plasma obtained stored at -20C.<br>
Other Assays<br>
Plasma glucose levels can be determined using an Analox glucose analyser<br>
(Hammersmith, London, UK), which employs the glucose oxidase method (Stevens JF,<br>
Clin. Chim. Acta 1971, 32:199). Insulin levels can be assayed by dextran-coated<br>
charcoal radioimmunoassay (Flatt PR and Bailey CJ, Diabetologia 1981,20:573).<br>
Incremental areas under plasma glucose and insulin curves (AUC) can be calculated<br>
using GraphPad PRISM version 3.0 (Graphpad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).<br>
The activity of GLP-1 compound can be part of the drug composition of the<br>
present invention as long as the GLP-1 drug is able to bind and induce signaling through<br>
the GLP-1 receptor. GLP-1 receptor binding and signal transduction can be assessed<br>
using in vitro assays such as those described in Examples 2, 3, and 4 of EP 619,322 and<br>
Examples 1, 2, and 3 of U. S. Patent No. 5,120,712, respectively (incorporated herein by<br>
reference).<br>
Pharmacokinetics studies can be performed as described in Example 7 of WO 02/46227<br>
(incorporated herein by reference).<br>
Half-life extension of GLP-1 derivatives after i. v. or s. c. administration.<br><br>
WO 2006/059106	PCT/GB2005/004599<br>
-104-<br>
The half-life extension of GLP-1 analogues can be determined by monitoring the<br>
concentration thereof in plasma after sc administration to healthy pigs. For comparison<br>
the concentration in plasma of GLP-1 (7-37) (natural active of form GLP-1 and used as<br>
a control) after sc. administration can be followed.<br>
The test substances will be dissolved in a vehicle suitable for subcutaneous or<br>
intravenous administration. The concentration will be adjusted so the dosing volume is<br>
approximately 1 ml. The study will be performed in 12 male Gottingen minipigs from<br>
Ellegaard Gottingen Minipigs ApS. An acclimatisation period of approximately 10 days<br>
will be allowed before the animals entered the study. At start of the acclimatisation<br>
period the minipigs will be about 5 months old and in the weight range of 8-10 kg.<br>
The study will be conducted in a suitable animal room with a room temperature<br>
set at 21-23Â°C and the relative humidity approximately 50%. The room will be<br>
illuminated to give a cycle of 12 hours light and 12 hours darkness. Light will be from<br>
06.00 to 18.00h. The animals will be housed in pens with straw as bedding, six together<br>
in each pen. The animals will have free access to domestic quality drinking water during<br>
the study, but will be fasted from approximately 16.00h the day before dosing until<br>
approximately 12 hours after dosing. The animals will be weighed on arrival and on the<br>
days of dosing.<br>
The animals will receive a single intravenous or subcutaneous injection. The<br>
subcutaneous injection will be given on the right side of the neck, approximately 5-7 cm<br>
from the ear and 7-9 cm from the middle of the neck. The injections will be given with a<br>
stopper on the needle, allowing 0.5 cm of the needle to be introduced. Each test<br>
substance will be given to three animals. Each animal received a dose of 2 nmol/kg<br>
body weight. Six animals will be dosed per week while the remaining six rested.<br>
A full plasma concentration-time profile will be obtained from each animal.<br>
Blood samples will be collected according to the following schedule: After intravenous<br>
administration: Predose (0), 0.17 (10 minutes), 0.5,1,2, 4,6, 8,12, 24,48, 72,96, and 120<br>
hours after injection. After subcutaneous administration: Predose (0), 0.5,1, 2, 4, 6, 8,<br>
12, 24,48, 72,96, and 120 hours after injection.<br>
At each sampling time, 2 ml of blood will be drawn from each animal. The<br>
blood samples will be taken from a jugular vein. The blood samples will be collected<br>
into test tubes containing a buffer for stabilisation in order to prevent enzymatic<br><br>
WO 2006/059106	PCT/GB2005/004599<br>
-105-<br>
degradation of the GLP-1 analogues. Plasma will be immediately transferred to<br>
Micronic-tubes. Approximately 200 ul plasma will be transferred to each Micronic-<br>
tube. The plasma was stored at-20Â°C until assayed. The plasma samples will be assayed<br>
for the content of GLP-1 analogues using an immunoassay.<br>
The plasma concentration-time profiles will be analysed by a non-<br>
compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis. The following pharmacokinetic parameters<br>
will be calculated at each occasion: AUC, AUC/Dose, AUC% Extrap, Cmax, tmax, ,Î»2, CL,<br>
CL/f,Vz,Vz/f and MRT.<br>
Compostions of the invention can also be tested in Danish Landrace pigs.<br>
Pigs (50% Duroc, 25% Yorkshire, 25% Danish Landrace, app 40 kg) will be<br>
fasted from the beginning of the experiment. To each pig 0.5 nmol of test composition<br>
per kg body weight will be administered in a 50 pM isotonic solution (5 mM phosphate,<br>
pH 7.4, 0.02% TweenÂ®-20 (Merck), 45 mg/ml mannitol (pyrogen free, Novo Nordisk).<br>
Blood samples will be drawn from a catheter in vena jugularis. 5 ml of the blood<br>
samples will be poured into chilled glasses containing 175 ul of the following solution:<br>
0.18 M EDTA, 15000 KIE/ml aprotinin (Novo Nordisk) and 0.30 mM Valine-<br>
Pyrrolidide (Novo Nordisk), pH 7.4. Within 30 min, the samples will be centrifuged for<br>
10 min at 5-6000*g. Temperature will be kept at 4Â°C. The supernatant will be pipetted<br>
into different glasses and kept at minus 20Â°C until use.<br>
The plasma concentrations of the peptides will be determined in a sandwich<br>
ELIS A or by RIA using different mono-or polyclonal antibodies. Choice of antibodies<br>
depends of the GLP-1 analogue. The time at which the peak concentration in plasma is<br>
achieved varies within wide limits, depending on the particular GLP-1 analogue<br>
selected.<br>

GLP-1 radio receptor assay (RRA):<br>
The GLP-1 radio receptor assay is a radiometric-ligand binding assay using<br>
LEADseeker imaging particles. The assay is composed of membrane fragments<br>
containing the GLP-1 receptor, unlabeled GLP-1 analogues, human GLP-1 labelled with<br>
125I and PS LEADseeker particles coated with wheat germ agglutinin (WGA). Cold and<br>
125I-labelled GLP-1 will compete for the binding to the receptor. When the LEADseeker<br>
particles are added they will bind to carbohydrates residues on the membrane fragments<br>
via the WGA-residues. The proximity between the 125I-molecules and the LEADseeker<br>
particles causes light emission from the particles. The LEADseeker will image the<br>
emitted light and it will be reversibly correlated to the amount of GLP-1 analogue<br>
present in the sample.<br>
Reagents &amp; Materials:<br>
Pre treatment of animal plasma: Animal plasma will be heat treated for 4 hrs at<br>

Stimulation of cAMP formation in a cell line expressing the cloned human GLP-<br>
1 receptor.<br>
Purified plasma membranes from a stable transfected cell line, BHK467-12A<br>
(tk-tsl3), expressing the human GLP-1 receptor will be stimulated with GLP-1 and<br>
peptide analogues, and the potency of cAMP production will be measured using the<br>
AlphaScreenâ¢ cAMP Assay Kit from Perkin Elmer Life Sciences.<br>
A stable transfected cell line will be prepared and a high expressing clone will<br>
be selected for screening. The cells will be grown at 5% C02 in DMEM, 5% FCS, 1%<br>
Pen/Strep and 0. 5 mg/ml G418.<br>
Cells at approximate 80% confluence will be washed 2X with PBS and<br>
harvested with Versene, centrifuged 5 min at 1000 rpm and the supernatant removed.<br>
The additional steps will be all made on ice. The cell pellet will be homogenized by the<br>
Ultrathurax for 20-30 sec. in 10 ml of Buffer 1 (20 mM Na-HEPES, 10 mM EDTA, pH<br><br>

(20 mM Na-HEPES, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4). The suspension will be homogenized for<br>
20-30 sec and centrifuged 15 min at 20.000 rpm. Suspension in Buffer 2,<br>
homogenization and centrifugation will be repeated once and the membranes will be<br>
resuspended in Buffer 2 and ready for further analysis or stored at -80Â°C. The functional<br>
receptor assay will be carried out by measuring the peptide induced cAMP production<br>
by The AlphaScreen Technology. The basic principle of The AlphaScreen Technology<br>
is a competition between endogenous cAMP and exogenously added biotin-cAMP. The<br>
capture of cAMP will be achieved by using a specific antibody conjugated to acceptor<br>
beads. Formed cAMP will be counted and measured on an AlphaFusion Microplate<br>
Analyzer. The EC50 values will be calculated using the Graph-Pad Prisme software.<br>
Example 11. Bacterial expression of a genetic fusion of glucagon like peptide-1 and<br>
iDom7h-8 using the GAS leader.<br>
GLP-1 (7-37), with glutamate at position 9 replaced by proline ([Pro9] GLP-l(7-37)),<br>
was cloned as a fusion with iDOM7h-8 (a P96E mutation by Kabat numbering in<br>
CDR3) into the pET 12a vector with a GAS leader (see WO 05/093074). The GLP-1<br>
glutamate to proline 9 replacement was in order to render the GLP-1 part of the fusion<br>
resistant to degradation by dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) cleavage (Brian D. Green<br>
et al. (2003) Metabolic Stability, Receptor Binding, cAMP Generation, Insulin secretion<br>
and Antihyperglycaemic Activity of Novel N-terminal Glu9-substituted Analogues of<br>
Glucagon-like-peptide-1: Biol. Chem. (384) 1543-1555). In total, three constructs were<br>
made, one with no linker, one with PSS amino acids between [Pro9]GLP-1 (7-37) and<br>
iDOM7h-8 and one with PSSGAP amino acids between [Pro9]GLP-1 (7-37) and<br>
iDOM7h-8 (shown in Figure 16 as Dom7h-8 the albumin binding form). Expression<br>
was in BL21 DE3 Plys S cells at 30Â°C for 48 hours using overnight expression<br>
autoinduction TB readymix (Novagen) before recovery of the supernatant by<br>
centrifugation. [Pro9] GLP-l(7-37) iDom7h-8 fusion was purified from the supernatant<br>
using affinity capture on protein L-agarose. The resin was then washed with 10 column<br>
volumes of PBS and bound protein eluted with 0.1 M glycine pH2. [Pro9]GLP-l(7-37)-<br>
iDom7h-8 fusion was then loaded in the glycine buffer, onto a cation exchange column<br><br>

(1 ml S-column, GE healthcare) that was pre-equilibrated with 20mM citrate buffer at<br>
pH 6.2. Elution was with a 0 - 50% gradient of the same buffer supplemented with 1M<br>
NaCl. Peaks were collected and the size of the proteins determined by SDS PAGE<br>
electrophoresis. Peaks with protein of the expected size were pooled and buffer<br>
exchanged to PBS. Identity of the protein was confirmed by mass spectrometry and N-<br>
terminal sequencing.<br>
Example 12. GLP-1 activity determination of [Pro9]GLP-l(7-37)-PSSGAP-iDOM7h-8<br>
fusion<br>
In order to confirm that the [Pro9]GLP-l(7-37)-PSSGAP-iDOM7h-8 fusion<br>
demonstrated GLP-1 activity, the fusion was subjected to two different biological<br>
assays. In the first assay, the RINm5f rat insulinoma cell line (developed in 1980 by<br>
Gadzar et al from x-ray induced transplantable insulinoma of the rat) was incubated<br>
with varying concentrations (l0pM to O.luM) of GLP-1 and the [Pro9] GLP-1 (7-3 7)-<br>
PSSGAP-iDOM7h-8 fusion for 60 min. Additionally, a single point assay of Exendin-4,<br>
a GLP-1 analogue resistant to degradation by dipeptidyl peptidase IV, and a single point<br>
buffer only assay were added as controls. Although the RTNm5f rat cells respond poorly<br>
to glucose, when exposed to nutrients or non-secretagogues, they display secretory<br>
responses similar to beta cells. Therefore, the effects of the compounds on cell<br>
proliferation were assessed by measuring the incorporated levels of 5-bromo-2'-<br>
deoxyuridine (BrdU) during DNA synthesis in proliferating cells using the Cell<br>
proliferation ELISA system (Amersham, Little Chalfont, UK) see Figure 17. Using<br>
OD450 to measure DNA levels, there was a dose dependent increase in DNA level with<br>
increasing levels of [Pro9]GLP-l(7-37)-PSSGAP-iDOM7h-8 fusion up to a<br>
concentration of lOOnM of the fusion. GLP-1 also showed the expected dose dependent<br>
response.<br>
In the second assay, RINm5f cells were incubated with varying concentrations (lOpM to<br>
O.lÎ¼M) of GLP-1 and the [Pro9]GLP-l(7-37)-PSSGAP-iDOM7h-8 fusion in 5.6mM<br>
glucose for 60 min. Additionally, a single point assay of Exendin-4, a GLP-1 analogue<br>
resistant to degradation by DPPIV and a single point Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer<br><br>
WO 2006/059106	PCT/GB2005/004599<br>
-112-<br>
(KRB) only assay were added as controls. Insulin secretion was assayed after incubation<br>
for 60 min at 37Â°C using KRB buffer supplemented GLP-1, 3A23 or exendin-4. The<br>
medium was collected, centrifuged and the supernatant assayed for insulin<br>
concentration using radioimmunoassay. Insulin concentration was normalised to cell<br>
number within each well. Insulin concentration (measured in ng/ml/hr) was then plotted<br>
against compound concentration. There was a dose dependent increase in insulin release<br>
at escalating doses of [Pro9]GLP-l(7-37)-PSSGAP-iDOM7h-8 fusion up to a fusion<br>
concentration of lOnM (see Figure 18). This agrees well with published data on GLP-1<br>
alone.<br>
Example 13. Bacterial expression of a genetic fusion of glucagon like peptide-1 and<br>
iDom7h-8 using the OMP-T leader.<br>
The same 3 constructs described in Example 11 (one with no linker, one with PSS<br>
amino acids between [Pro9]GLP-l(7-37) and iDOM7h-8 and one with PSSGAP amino<br>
acids between [Pro9]GLP-l(7-37) and iDOM7h-8) were remade with the OMP-T leader.<br>
For clarity, the order of the elements in the construct were OMP-T leader, [Pro9] GLP-1,<br>
Linker (where appropriate) and the iDom7h-8. Expression was in BL21 DE3 Plys S<br>
cells at 25Â°C for 4 hours in TB media induced with 0.5mM IPTG at OD 16 before<br>
recovery of the cell pellet by centrifugation. Secreted proteins were then recovered by<br>
periplasmic preparation. GLP-1 iDom7h-8 fusions were purified from the periplasmic<br>
fraction using affinity capture on protein L-agarose. The resin was then washed with 10<br>
column volumes of PBS and bound protein eluted with 0.1 M glycine pH2. [Pro9]GLP-<br>
1(7-37) fusion was then loaded in the glycine buffer, onto a cation exchange column (1<br>
ml S-column, GE healthcare) that was pre-equilibrated with 20mM citrate buffer at pH<br>
6.2. Elution was with a 0 - 50% gradient of the same buffer supplemented with 1M<br>
NaCl. In this case, washing the column with 20mM citrate buffer at pH 6.2 (0% NaCl)<br>
led to flow through of the band of the expected size and so this was concentrated using a<br>
5K vivaspin column (Vivascience).<br>

The [Pro9]GLP-l-PSS-iDOM7h-8 fusion construct (as described in Figure 16b but using<br>
iDom7h-8) will be cloned into the pPICzct vector both alone and with an N-terminal<br>
EAEA extension and transformed into Pichia pastoris KM71h. Protein will be<br>
expressed (i) using methanol induction over 4 days at 30Â°C and (ii) using methanol<br>
induction over 2 days at 25Â°C. Supernatant will be recovered by centrifugation and<br>
protein checked for size on an SDS PAGE gel.<br>
It is expected that the fusions will have the correct size by SDS Page and be active in<br>
the GLP-1 assay as described in Example 10 and in Example 12.<br>
Example 15. E.coli expression of glucagon like peptide-1 and iDom7h-8 in BL21 DE3<br>

The same fusions as described in Example 11 will be cloned into the pET21 expression<br>
vector (Novagen), which is designed for protein expression in the cytoplasm.<br>
Optionally, a protease cleavage site will be included in the constructs between a<br>
sacrificial N-terminus and the HAP... of the [Pro9]GLP-1 (7-37). This will enable the<br>
protein to be digested to ensure a fully native N-terminus. Enzymes that could be used<br>
for this include Factor Xa, thrombin or DPPI. Protein will then be expressed at high<br>
levels in BL21(DE3) cells upon IPTG induction and will accumulate in intracellular<br>
inclusion bodies. Inclusion bodies will be isolated from the BL21 cells and solublised in<br>
guanidine HC1. Following reduction, inclusion bodies will be refolded in a redox<br>
shuffling buffer system (Buchner, J., Pastan, I. and Brinkmann, U. (1992). A method for<br>
increasing the yield of properly folded recombinant fusion proteins. Anal. Biochem.<br>

vivaspin column (Vivascience) and purified by S-column (GE healthcare).<br>
It is expected that the fusions will have the correct size by SDS Page and be active in<br>

and supernatant (containing expressed protein) will be recovered by centrifugation.<br>
[Pro9]GLP-l-PSS-DOM7h-8 fusion will be purified from the periplasmic fraction using<br>

DOM7h-8 respectively.) Expression will be in BL21 DE3 Plys S cells at 25 Â°C for 4<br>
hours in TB media induced with 0.5mM IPTG at before recovery of the cell pellet by<br>
centrifugation. Secreted proteins will then be recovered by periplasmic preparation.<br>
PYY Dom7h-8 fusion will be purified from the periplasmic fraction using affinity<br>
capture on protein L-agarose. The resin will then be washed with 10 column volumes of<br>
PBS and bound protein eluted with 0.1 M glycine pH2 and purified further by ion<br>
exchange. Purified protein will then be buffer exchanged to PBS by dialysis,<br><br>

concentrated in a 5K vivaspin column (Vivascience) and subjected to biological assay to<br>
measure stimulation of cAMP release as described (Goumain et al. (2001) The Peptide<br>
YY-Preferring Receptor Mediating Inhibition of Small Intestinal Secretion Is a<br>
Peripheral Y2 Receptor: Pharmacological Evidence and Molecular Cloning: Molecular<br>
pharmacology: 60 124-134). Briefly, Isolated intestinal crypt cells at 200uJg protein/ml<br>
will be incubated under continuous agitation for 45min at 15Â°C in 0.5ml of phosphate-<br>
buffered saline, pH 7.0, containing 1.4% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.1% bacitracin,<br>
and 0.2mM 3-isobutyl-l-methylxanthine(IBMX) as described (Servin et al. (1989):<br>

adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate production in rat small intestine: structural requirements<br>
of peptides for interacting with PYY-preferring receptors. Endocrinology 124: 692-<br>
700). PYY alone or PYY-Dom7h-8 fusion will be added together with a potent<br>
physiological stimulant of cAMP production in enterocytes (e.g., VIP). The reaction will<br>
be initiated by adding cells and stopped after 45min by adding 50|j,l of 11M perchloric<br>
acid. After centrifugation for l0min at 4,000g-, the cAMP present in the supernatant will<br>
be succinylated, and its concentration will be measured by radioimmunoassay as<br>
described (Laburthe et al., (1982) Alpha-adrenergic inhibition of cyclic AMP<br>
accumulation in epithelial cells isolated from rat small intestine. Biochim Biophys Ada<br>
721: 101-108).<br>
It is expected that the fusion be of the expected size and will show PYY activity<br>
equivalent to the non-fusion controls.<br>
Example 18. E. coli expression of a Dom7h-8 Peptide YY, GLP-1, fusion<br>
A [Pro9]GLP-l(7-37)-DOM7h-8-PYY (see Figure 19c) fusion will be cloned into the<br>
pET GAS vector and then expressed as described for the Dom7h-8 PYY described in<br>
Example 17. After purification, the fusion will be assayed for the biological activity of<br>
both PYY and GLP-1 following the assays described in Examples 17 and Example 12<br>
respectively.<br>
