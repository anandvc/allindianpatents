PROCESS FOR PRODUCING WATER-DISPERSIBLE PARTICULATE<br>
AGRICULTURAL-CHEMICAL COMPOSITION<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a process for producing<br>
a water-dispersible particulate agricultural-chemical<br>
composition for use in controlling pests and weeds for<br>
agricultural/horticultural crops.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002]<br>
Heretofore, various types of agricultural-chemical<br>
formulations such as dusts, granules, wettable powders,<br>
water-dispersible particulates, liquids, aqueous suspensions,<br>
emulsifiable concentrates, and the like have been known. Of these<br>
agricultural-chemical formulations, water-dispersible<br>
particulates are easy for users to handle since they do not powder<br>
during use thereof and therefore users would be exposed little<br>
to the agricultural-chemical ingredient and since they are easy<br>
to meter. Accordingly, forms of recent agricultural-chemical<br>
formulations tend to be changed from wettable powders to<br>
water-dispersible particulates.<br>
[0003]<br>
In general water-dispersible particulates should easily<br>
disperse in water, and for this purpose they should be produced<br>
by a method in which granulation is not accompanied by application<br>
of pressure and the resulting granules are free from a consolidated<br>
structure. Such methods include a so-called fluidized-bed<br>
granulation method where a powdery mixture of an<br>
agricultural-chemical active ingredient, a surfactant and an<br>
extender or the like is fluidized in a layer into which hot air<br>
is pumped, and an aqueous solution containing a binder is sprayed<br>
thereon to make the powdery particles aggregate together thereby<br>
forming granules; and a so-called stirring granulation method<br>
where an aqueous solution containing a binder is sprayed on a<br>
powdery mixture of an agricultural-chemical active ingredient,<br>
a surfactant and an extender or the like kept stirred at high speed<br>
to make the powdery particles aggregate together thereby forming<br>
<br>
granules (Non-Patent Documents 1 and 2).<br>
[0004]<br>
In these methods, however, the granules produced have a broad<br>
particle size distribution and sieving results in a low production<br>
yield with respect to a necessary particle size. In addition,<br>
since the granulation is carried out as a batch process, the amount<br>
of the granules to be produced per unit time is small. Therefore,<br>
the methods are substantially unsuitable for industrial<br>
production of agricultural chemicals.<br>
[0005]<br>
On the other hand, as a granulation method that secures high<br>
producibility of agricultural-chemical formulations, there is a<br>
so-called extrusion granulation method where an<br>
agricultural-chemical active ingredient, a surfactant and an<br>
extender or the like are kneaded with water, and extruded through<br>
pores formed in a screen to give columnar granules (Non-Patent<br>
Document 1) . In this method, a high pressure is given to extrude<br>
the mixture through the pores and, as a result, the formed granules<br>
have a consolidated structure with poor water-dispersibility. In<br>
this connection, while the water-dispersibility could be improved<br>
by reducing the diameter of the pores to have smaller granules,<br>
the pressure to be imparted to the screen may increase with<br>
reduction in the diameter of the pores and cause increased<br>
fragility of the screen thereby precluding the granulation itself.<br>
[0006]<br>
Also, as a method for producing a granular<br>
agricultural-chemical composition having improved<br>
water-dispersibility and suspensibility of<br>
agricultural-chemical ingredient, there is a method in which a<br>
mixture containing an agricultural-chemical active ingredient and<br>
a surfactant is kneaded with water, and the kneaded mixture is<br>
pulverized to have a predetermined particle size and dried, or<br>
the kneaded mixture is dried and made to have a predetermined<br>
particle size (Patent Document 1) . In this method, although the<br>
resulting granules are not in a consolidated state and have good<br>
water-dispersibility, the step of pulverizing the kneaded mixture<br>
may cause problems. Specifically, in the case where the kneaded<br>
mixture before dried is pulverized, the mixture significantly<br>
adheres to the pulverizer because of water contained in the mixture<br>
On the other hand, the kneaded mixture which is dried before the<br>
pulverization is extremely brittle and the size distribution of<br>
<br>
the pulverized particles is large, therefore the production yield<br>
of the granular agricultural-chemical composition having the<br>
intended particle size is extremely low.<br>

Disclosure of Invention<br>
Problem to be Solved by the Invention<br>
[0008]<br>
Accordingly, an object of the invention is to provide a<br>
method for efficient production of a water-dispersible<br>
particulate agricultural-chemical composition having improved<br>
disintegrability/dispersibility in water.<br>
Means for Solving the Problems<br>
[0009]<br>
The present inventors have assiduously studied methods for<br>
producing granular agricultural-chemical composition and, as a<br>
result, have found that a water-dispersible particulate<br>
agricultural-chemical composition having a desired particle size<br>
range can be extremely efficiently obtained by producing granules<br>
according to an extrusion granulation method using a screen having<br>
pores slightly larger in diameter than the desired particle size,<br>
drying and pulverizing the granules so as not to powder, and further<br>
sieving the pulverized particles to have a desired particle size.<br>
Thus, the present invention was completed.<br>
[0010]<br>
Specifically, the present invention may be summarized as<br>
follows.<br>
(1) A method for producing a water-dispersible particulate<br>
agricultural-chemical composition having a particle size within<br>
a range of from 50 to 1,000 )µm, the method comprises the following<br>
steps (a) to (e):<br>
(a) a step of kneading an agricultural-chemical active<br>
ingredient, a surfactant and water,<br>
(b) a step of extruding the kneaded mixture through a screen<br>
<br>
having pores from 600 to 2,000 font in diameter to form granules,<br>
(c) a step of drying the granules,<br>
(d) a step of rotating two toothed rolls with irregularities<br>
on the surface arranged in parallel to each other, and leading<br>
the dried granules to pass through the toothed rolls thereby-<br>
pulverizing the granules, and<br>
(e) a step of sieving the pulverized particles.<br>
(2) The method for producing a water-dispersible particulate<br>
agricultural-chemical composition of the above (1), wherein in<br>
the step (e) , the pulverized particles are sieved through two types<br>
of meshes each having an opening diameter within a range of from<br>
50 to 1,000 µm.<br>
(3) The method for producing a water-dispersible particulate<br>
agricultural-chemical composition of the above (2), wherein in<br>
the step (e) , the pulverized particles are sieved in such a manner<br>
that the particles are first sieved through the mesh having the<br>
larger opening diameter of the two types of meshes each having<br>
an opening diameter within a range of from 50 to 1,000 µm, then<br>
those having passed through the sieve are further sieved through<br>
the mesh having the smaller opening diameter, and those having<br>
remained on the mesh are collected.<br>
Effect of the Invention<br>
[0011]<br>
In the method for producing a water-dispersible particulate<br>
agricultural-chemical composition of the present invention, the<br>
material loss in the production process is low and the load to<br>
the machines for the production is also low. In addition, the<br>
production yield of the water-dispersible particulate<br>
agricultural-chemical composition having the intended particle<br>
size is high compared with that in conventional production<br>
methods.<br>
[0012]<br>
Accordingly, the method of the present invention is an<br>
extremely efficient and economical method for producing a<br>
water-dispersible particulate agricultural-chemical<br>
composition.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[0013]<br>
The term "particle size" as used herein, means the range<br>
<br>
in which the diameter of the individual particles in the<br>
water-dispersible particulate agricultural-chemical composition<br>
falls. For example, a water-dispersible particulate<br>
agricultural-chemical composition having a particle size of from<br>
250 to 500 µm means the particles which have passed through a mesh<br>
having an opening diameter of 500 µm and remain on a mesh having<br>
an opening diameter of 250 µm, that is, the composition in which<br>
the diameter of all the particles falls within a range of from<br>
250 to 500 µm.<br>
[0014]<br>
The method of the present invention for producing a<br>
water-dispersible particulate agricultural-chemical composition<br>
having a particle size within a range of from 50 to 1,000 µm (hereinafter referred to as "the method of the invention") is<br>
characterized by comprising the following steps (a) to (e):<br>
(a) a step of kneading an agricultural-chemical active<br>
ingredient, a surfactant and water,<br>
(b) a step of extruding the kneaded mixture through a screen<br>
having pores from 600 to 2,000 µm in diameter to form granules,<br>
(c) a step of drying the granules,<br>
(d) a step of rotating two toothed rolls with irregularities<br>
on the surface arranged in parallel to each other, and leading<br>
the dried granules to pass through the toothed rolls thereby<br>
pulverizing the granules, and<br>
(e) a step of sieving the pulverized particles.<br>
[0015]<br>
The step (a) in the method of the invention is a step of<br>
kneading an agricultural-chemical active ingredient, a surfactant<br>
and optionally any other ingredient and water. In this step, the<br>
above-mentioned ingredients are uniformly mixed, thereby enabling<br>
efficient granulation in the next step (b) . Apparatuses for use<br>
in the kneading include a Henschel mixer, a twin-arm kneader, a<br>
paddle mixer, a blade mixer, a high-speed mixer, a vertical mixer,<br>
and the like. The amount of water in kneading may be adjusted<br>
to a level suitable for extrusion granulation, and may be from<br>
5 to 30 parts, preferably from 10 to 20 parts relative to the total<br>
amount, 100 parts of the above-mentioned agricultural-chemical<br>
active ingredient, surfactant and any other optional ingredient.<br>
[0016]<br>
Prior to being kneaded with water, preferably, the<br>
agricultural-chemical active ingredient, the surfactant and the<br>
<br>
others are mixed and optionally these ingredients are ground into<br>
powdery particles having a uniform particle size, using a grinder<br>
as typified by an impact grinder, a high-speed airflow-assisted<br>
grinder or the like. The mean particle diameter of the ground<br>
powdery particles is from 1 to 20 µm, preferably from 1 to 15 µm,<br>
more preferably from 2 to 10 µm. The term "mean particle diameter"<br>
as referred to herein, means a volume median diameter.<br>
[0017]<br>
The agricultural-chemical active ingredients include those<br>
known in the agricultural-chemical field, such as insecticides,<br>
microbicides, herbicides, plant growth regulators, and the like.<br>

of liquid, solid or paste, including the following examples, to<br>

These surfactants may be used singly, or two or more<br>
different types thereof may be used in combination. The total<br>
content of the surfactants in the water-dispersible particulate<br>
agricultural-chemical composition to be produced according to the<br>
method of the invention is not specifically defined, and may be<br>
approximately from 2 to 30 parts by weight relative to 100 parts<br>
by weight of the composition.<br>
[0028]<br>
Other ingredients that may be optionally added to the<br>
above-mentioned agricultural-chemical active ingredient,<br>
surfactant and water include those that may be used in ordinary<br>
water-dispersible agricultural-chemical composition. For<br>
example, formulation additives such as water-soluble fine powder,<br>
mineral fine powder, oil-absorbing fine powder, binder, grinding<br>
aid, defoaming agent and the like may be optionally incorporated.<br>
The water-soluble fine powder includes lactose, water-soluble<br>
starch, urea, alkali metal salts or ammonium salts of organic acids<br>

agent is not specifically defined, and may include silicone-based<br>
surfactants, free long-chain fatty acids or alkali metal salts<br>
thereof, and the like.<br>
[0029]<br>
The mixture kneaded in the above-mentioned step is-then<br>
extruded through a screen having pores from 600 to 2,000 µm in<br>
diameter to form granules in the next step (b). The pore size<br>
of the screen is preferably from 600 to 1,800 µm, more preferably<br>
from 600 to 1,500 µm. In cases where the pore size of the screen<br>
is smaller than the range, not only does the yield per unit time<br>
in extrusion granulation extremely decline but the pressure in<br>
passing through the screen increases, leading to increased<br>
frequency of screen breakage. On the other hand, when the pore<br>
size is larger than the range, the granulation yield per unit time<br>
could be large but the efficiency may be undermined because more<br>
time is required for drying and the production yield in the step<br>
(d) may be decline with increase in unintended fine powder in<br>
grinding. The pore size of the screen is preferably from 0.6 to<br>
3 times, more preferably from 0.8 to 2 times the larger opening<br>
diameter of the meshes for use in sieving in the step (e).<br>
[0030]<br>
Any granulator can be used for extrusion granulation as long<br>
as the machine is equipped for granulation, and its shape is not<br>
specifically defined. Specific examples of the granulator<br>
include a horizontal extrusion-type screw-extrusion granulator,<br>
a disc die-type roll-extrusion granulator, a basket-type<br>
blade-extrusion granulator, and the like.<br>
[0031]<br>
The granules formed as above are then dried in the step (c) .<br>
Using a drier such as a fluidized bed drier or the like, the granules<br>
are dried at a hot air temperature of from 50 to 100°C or so for<br>
10 to 20 minutes or so. In the operation, the intralayer<br>
temperature in the granules rises to the same level as that of<br>
the hot air temperature and the water content thereof decreases<br>
generally to 0.5 to 3% by mass. When not dried, the granules may<br>
be again kneaded together by the rotational movement of the<br>
pulverizer in the next step (d) and therefore the granules could<br>
not be pulverized.<br>
[0032]<br>
The granules obtained in the above-mentioned step are in<br>
the form of columns having a constant size, having each of the<br>
ingredients uniformly dispersed therein, and are in a consolidated<br>
state (a strongly-compacted state having a uniform density).<br>
[0033]<br>
The granules are then subjected to the step (d) . In the step,<br>
two toothed rolls with irregularities formed on the surface are<br>
arranged in parallel to each other with a predetermined distance,<br>
and these toothed rolls are rotated. Then the dried granules are<br>
led to pass through the rotating rolls for pulverization. Through<br>
this step, the pulverized particles comprising a lot of granules<br>
of a desired particle size can be obtained to enable efficient<br>
production of the water-dispersible particulate<br>
agricultural-chemical composition having a desired particle size<br>
range. In this step, preferably, the toothed rolls are arranged<br>
in parallel to the ground and the dried granules are thrown from<br>
above into the toothed rolls.<br>
[0034]<br>
The toothed rolls for use in this step each have<br>
irregularities formed on the roll surface. In general, the<br>
diameter of the roll is from 50 mm to 300 mm and the length thereof<br>
is from 20 mm to 1,500 mm. The shape of the irregularities of<br>
the toothed rolls is not specifically defined. Preferably, the<br>
cross section of the irregularities has a profile of continuous<br>
triangular mounds. The shape of the triangles is not also<br>
specifically defined. Preferably, the height and the width (base)<br>
of the triangle fall within a range of from 0.3 mm to 10 mm and<br>
more preferably, the height and the width are the same. Further,<br>
the distance between the rolls is not specifically defined, and<br>
in general, it may be from 0.05 mm to 1.5 mm. The size of the<br>
pulverized particles can be controlled by changing the shape of<br>
the teeth of the rolls and the distance between the rolls. In<br>
general, when the height and the width of the triangles of the<br>
teeth are narrower, and when the distance between the rolls is<br>
narrower, the pulverized particles may be smaller. The apparatus<br>
for such pulverizing may be a frame-type pulverizing apparatus.<br>
[0035]<br>
In the present invention, the particles pulverized as in<br>
the above may be further pulverized by using two or more of the<br>
above-mentioned pair of two toothed rolls in combination. In this<br>
case, preferably, the shape of the teeth of the rolls and the<br>
distance between the rolls are so configured that the latter<br>
pulverizing could give particles having a smaller particle size<br>
than the first pulverizing. A combination of these toothed rolls<br>
<br>
comprises, for example, rolls with triangle teeth having a height<br>
and a width of 1 mm each, arranged at the distance of 0.27 mm for<br>
the first pulverization; and rolls with triangle teeth having a<br>
height and a width of 0.6 mm each, arranged at the distance of<br>
0.25 mm for the latter pulverization.<br>
[0036]<br>
The particles pulverized as in the above are then sieved<br>
in the step (e). The sieving is conducted to obtain the<br>
water-dispersible particulate agricultural-chemical composition<br>
having a particle size within a range of from 50 to 1,000 µm,<br>
preferably from 100 to 850 µm, more preferably from 250 to 700<br>
µm. Concretely, the sieving may be attained by the use of two types<br>
of meshes each having an opening diameter within a range of from<br>
50 to 1,000 µm. More concretely, the pulverized particles are<br>
first sieved through the mesh having the larger opening diameter<br>
of the two types of meshes each having an opening diameter within<br>
a range of from 50 to 1,000 µm, then the particles having passed<br>
through the sieve are further sieved through the mesh having the<br>
smaller opening diameter, and those having remained on the mesh<br>
are collected. For example, the water-dispersible particulate<br>
agricultural-chemical composition having a particle size of from<br>
250 to 600 µm can be obtained by first sieving the pulverized<br>
particles through a mesh having an opening diameter of 600 µm,<br>
then further sieving those having passed through it, through a<br>
mesh having an opening diameter of 250 µm, and collecting those<br>
having remained on the mesh. The machine for the sieving includes<br>
a rotary shifter, a shaking sieve, and the like.<br>
[0037]<br>
According to the steps (a) to (e) described above, the<br>
water-dispersible particulate agricultural-chemical composition<br>
having a particle size of from 50 to 1,000 µm can be produced<br>
efficiently.<br>
[0038]<br>
The water-dispersible particulate agricultural-chemical<br>
composition thus produced is excellent in<br>
disintegrability/dispersibility in water.<br>
[0039]<br>
In the present invention, the reason why the<br>
water-dispersible particulate agricultural-chemical composition<br>
having a particle size of from 50 to 1,000 µm can be produced<br>
efficiently is because a uniform kneaded mixture of ingredients<br>
such as an agricultural-chemical active ingredient and others is<br>
produced in the step (a), and then granules having a shape of<br>
columns with a constant size in a consolidated state are produced<br>
in the step (b) . In addition, when the granules dried in the step<br>
(c) are led to pass through two toothed rolls used in the<br>
latter-stage of the step (d) , almost all the granules are cut from<br>
the side of each column to be pulverized since the granules have<br>
a shape of columns with a constant size; and while they are<br>
pulverized, the consolidated structure of the granules prevents<br>
generation of large amount of unintended fine powder, with the<br>
result that the water-dispersible particulate<br>
agricultural-chemical composition having a desired particle size<br>
can be obtained efficiently in a high production yield.<br>
[0040]<br>
On the other hand, when the ingredients of the granules to<br>
be processed in the step (d) are not homogeneous, when the density<br>
of the granules is not uniform, or when the granules are amorphous,<br>
then the particles pulverized in the step (d) have a broad particle<br>
size distribution, and in particular, unintended fine particles<br>
are formed much, resulting in a low production yield.<br>
Examples<br>
[0041]<br>
The present invention will be described in more detail with<br>
reference to Examples and Comparative Examples; however, the<br>
invention should not be limited to these Examples. In the<br>
following Examples, the term "part" means part by weight.<br>
[0042]<br>
Example 1<br>
40 parts of pyribencarb, 4 parts of sodium alkyl sulfate,<br>
5 parts of sodium lignin sulfonate, and 51 parts of calcium<br>
carbonate were mixed, and ground with a high-speed<br>
airflow-assisted grinder so that the mean particle size of the<br>
ingredients could be 7 µm. Next, 15 parts of water was added to<br>
100 parts of the ground particles, and further kneaded. At the<br>
time when the added water had penetrated into the whole mixture,<br>
the kneaded mixture was granulated with a horizontal<br>
extrusion-type screw-extrusion granulator. The screen used in<br>
extrusion granulation had pores 800 µm in diameter. The obtained<br>
granules were dried in a fluidized bed drier at a hot air<br>
temperature of 55°C for about 10 minutes until the intralayer<br>
temperature could reach 55°C. Subsequently, using a frame-type<br>
pulverizing apparatus having two toothed rolls arranged in<br>
parallel to the ground and having a slot above the rolls, the dried<br>
granules were led to pass through the rotating rolls in this<br>
apparatus and pulverized. The height and the width of the<br>
triangles of the teeth were both 0.6 mm and the distance between<br>
the rolls was 0.25 mm. The pulverized particles were then sieved<br>
through a mesh having an opening diameter of 500 µm, and those<br>
having passed through the mesh were further sieved through a mesh<br>
having an opening diameter of 250 µm; and those having remained<br>
on the mesh were collected to obtain a water-dispersible<br>
particulate agricultural-chemical composition having a particle<br>
size within a range of from 250 to 500 µm.<br>
[0043]<br>
Example 2<br>
40 parts of pyribencarb, 4 parts of sodium alkyl sulfate,<br>
5 parts of sodium lignin sulfonate, and 51 parts of calcium<br>
carbonate were mixed, and ground with a high-speed<br>
airflow-assisted grinder so that the mean particle size of the<br>
ingredients could be 7 µm. Next, 15 parts of water was added to<br>
100 parts of the ground particles, and further kneaded. At the<br>
time when the added water had penetrated into the whole mixture,<br>
the kneaded mixture was granulated with a horizontal<br>
extrusion-type screw-extrusion granulator. The screen used in<br>
extrusion granulation had pores 1,800 fim in diameter. The<br>
obtained granules were dried in a fluidized bed drier at a hot<br>
air temperature of 55°C for about 20 minutes until the intralayer<br>
temperature could reach 55°C. Subsequently, using a frame-type<br>
pulverizing apparatus having two pairs of toothed rolls arranged<br>
one above the other in parallel to the ground and having a slot<br>
above the rolls, the dried granules were led to pass through the<br>
rotating rolls in this apparatus and pulverized. The height and<br>
the width of the triangles of the teeth were both 1.5 mm and the<br>
distance between the rolls was 0.8 mm in the upper pair of rolls;<br>
and the height and the width were both 0.6 mm and the distance<br>
was 0.25 mm in the lower pair of rolls. The pulverized particles<br>
were then sieved through a mesh having an opening diameter of 500<br>
µm, and those having passed through the mesh were further sieved<br>
through a mesh having an opening diameter of 250 µm; and those<br>
having remained on the mesh were collected to obtain a<br>
water-dispersible particulate agricultural-chemical composition<br>
<br>
having a particle size within a range of from 250 to 500 µm.<br>
[0044]<br>
Example 3<br>
40 parts of mepanipyrim, 2 parts of sodium alkyl sulfate,<br>
8 parts of sodium lignin sulfonate, and 50 parts of clay were mixed,<br>
and ground with a high-speed airflow-assisted grinder so that the<br>
mean particle size of the ingredients could be 5 µm. Next, 18 parts<br>
of water was added to 100 parts of the ground particles, and further<br>
kneaded. At the time when the added water had penetrated into<br>
the whole mixture, the kneaded mixture was granulated with a<br>
horizontal extrusion-type screw-extrusion granulator. The<br>
screen used in extrusion granulation had pores 1, 000 µm in diameter.<br>
The obtained granules were dried in a fluidized bed drier at a<br>
hot air temperature of 55°C for about 10 minutes until the<br>
intralayer temperature could reach 55°C. Subsequently, using a<br>

rolls in this apparatus and pulverized. The height and the width<br>
of the triangles of the teeth were both 0.6 mm and the distance<br>
between the rolls was 0.25 mm. The pulverized particles were then<br>
sieved through a mesh having an opening diameter of 600 µm, and<br>
those having passed through the mesh were further sieved through<br>
a mesh having an opening diameter of 150 µm; and those having<br>
remained on the mesh were collected to obtain a water-dispersible<br>
particulate agricultural-chemical composition having a particle<br>
size within a range of from 150 to 600 µm.<br>
[0045]<br>
Example 4<br>
10 parts of pyribencarb, 30 parts of a mixture (1/1 by weight)<br>
of iminoctadine albesilate and white carbon, 4 parts of sodium<br>
alkyl sulfate, 15 parts of maleic anhydride-isobutylene<br>
copolycondensate, and 41 parts of calcium carbonate were mixed,<br>
and ground with a high-speed airflow-assisted grinder so that the<br>
mean particle size of the ingredients could be 9 µm. Next, 20 parts<br>
of water was added to 100 parts of the ground particles, and further<br>
kneaded. At the time when the added water had penetrated into<br>
the whole mixture, the kneaded mixture was granulated with a<br>
horizontal extrusion-type screw-extrusion granulator. The<br>
screen used in extrusion granulation had pores 600 µm in diameter.<br>
The obtained granules were dried in a fluidized bed drier at a<br>

remained on the mesh were collected to obtain a water-dispersible<br>
particulate agricultural-chemical composition having a particle<br>
size within a range of from 150 to 600 µm.<br>
[0046]<br>
Example 5<br>
50 parts of pyriminobac-methyl, 20 parts of sodium<br>
alkylnaphthalene sulfonate-formalin condensate, 1 part of<br>
polyoxyalkylene alkylaryl ether, and 29 parts of calcined<br>
diatomaceous earth were mixed, and ground with a high-speed<br>
airflow-assisted grinder so that the mean particle size of the<br>
ingredients could be 4 µm. Next, 15 parts of water was added to<br>
100 parts of the ground particles, and further kneaded. At the<br>
time when the added water had penetrated into the whole mixture,<br>
the kneaded mixture was granulated with a horizontal<br>

[0052]<br>
Comparative Example 5<br>
10 parts of pyribencarb, 30 parts of a mixture (1/1 by weight)<br>
of iminoctadine albesilate and white carbon, 4 parts of sodium<br>
alkyl sulfate, 15 parts of sodium<br>
<br>
naphthalenesulfonate-formaldehyde condensate, and 41 parts of<br>
calcium carbonate were mixed, and ground with a high-speed<br>
airflow-assisted grinder so that the mean particle size of the<br>
ingredients could be 9 µm. Next, 20 parts of water was added to<br>
100 parts of the ground particles, and further kneaded. At the<br>
time when the added water had penetrated into the whole mixture,<br>
the kneaded mixture was granulated with a horizontal<br>
extrusion-type screw-extrusion granulator. The screen used in<br>
extrusion granulation had pores 600 µm in diameter. The obtained<br>
granules were dried in a fluidized bed drier at a hot air<br>
temperature of 55°C for about 10 minutes until the intralayer<br>
temperature could reach 55°C. The dried granules were sieved<br>
through a mesh having an opening diameter of 600 µm, and those<br>
having passed through the mesh were further sieved through a mesh<br>
having an opening diameter of 150 µm; and those having remained<br>
on the mesh were collected to obtain a water-dispersible<br>
particulate agricultural-chemical composition having a particle<br>
size within a range of from 150 to 600 µm.<br>
[0053]<br>
Test Example 1<br>
Disintegration Test:<br>
0.3077 g of calcium carbonate and 0.092 g of magnesium oxide<br>
were dissolved in a small amount of diluted hydrochloric acid,<br>
then heated and boiled on a sand bath to remove hydrochloric acid.<br>
Distilled water was added to the remaining solution to make 10<br>
liters in total. Subsequently, 100 ml of the obtained solution<br>
was put into a 100-ml stoppered measuring cylinder, and kept at<br>
20°C in a temperature-controlled room. 100 mg of the<br>
water-dispersible particulate agricultural-chemical composition<br>
produced in Examples 1 to 6 and Comparative Example 5 was put into<br>
the measuring cylinder, statically left as it was for 30 seconds,<br>
and then the measuring cylinder was turned upside down repeatedly<br>
in a ratio of once a second, whereupon the turning-down frequency<br>
needed for disintegrating the whole water-dispersible particulate<br>
agricultural-chemical composition was counted. The results are<br>
shown in Table 1.<br>
[0054]<br>
Table 1<br>
[0055]<br>
From Table 1, it is known that the water-dispersible<br>
particulate agricultural-chemical compositions of the present<br>
invention have high disintegrability in water and are excellent<br>
in dispersibility.<br>
[0056]<br>
Test Example 2<br>
Evaluation of Production Efficiency:<br>
Using starting materials of 10 kg in total,<br>
water-dispersible particulate agricultural-chemical<br>
compositions were produced according to the above-mentioned<br>
Examples and Comparative Examples, and the weight of the<br>
finally-obtained water-dispersible particulate<br>
agricultural-chemical composition was measured. The results are<br>
shown in Table 2.<br>
[0057]<br>
Table 2<br>
[0058]<br>
From Table 2, it is known that the method for producing a<br>
water-dispersible particulate agricultural-chemical composition<br>
of the present invention provides a high production yield and is<br>
excellent in production efficiency.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
[0059]<br>
According to the method for producing a water-dispersible<br>
particulate agricultural-chemical composition of the present<br>
invention, a loss of starting materials in the production process<br>
is small, a load to the machine for the production is low, and<br>
the production yield of the water-dispersible particulate<br>
agricultural-chemical composition having a desired particle size<br>
is high as compared with conventional production methods.<br>
[0060]<br>
Therefore, the method of the present invention can be<br>
advantageously used in producing a water-dispersible particulate<br>
agricultural-chemical composition for use in controlling pests<br>
and weeds for agricultural/horticultural crops.<br>
CLAIMS<br>
