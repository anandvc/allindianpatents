HARDCOAT COMPOSITION<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a hardcoat composition comprising at least a poly (methyl) glycidyl ether compound, a cat ionic polymerizable group-containing silsesquioxane compound, a silicate compound, a silane compound and/or a partial condensed compound thereof, and a cationic photopolymerization initiator, which composition has high adhesion to thiourethane resins or resins obtained by thermal ring-opening polymerization of thioepoxy compounds, high surface hardness and scratch resistance, excellent weather resistance. The present invention also relates to a hardcoat composition which contains substantially no solvent for dilution.<br>
Background Art<br>
Lenses made of resin have rapidly come into wide use as lens resins, for example, spectacle lenses, camera lenses, pickup lenses used in optical recording and regenerating devices, and' the like, in replacement of glass lenses, from the viewpoints of light weight, impact resistance, colorability and the like. For this purpose, products of radical polymerization of diethylene glycol bis(allyl carbonate) (hereinafter, abbreviated to D.A.C.), polycarbonate (PC), polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and the like have been conventionally used heretofore. However, because these resins for lenses have refractive indexes nd of about 1. 4 9 to 1. 58, in order to obtain optical<br><br>
properties equivalent to those of glass lenses, it is necessary to increase the center thickness, edge thickness and curvature of a lens . Thus, the lens becomes very thick in overall. Therefore, there has been a demand for a resin having a higher refractive index.<br>
As a solution for such problems, Patent Document 1 describes a resin obtained by thermal polymerization of a thiol compound and an isocyanate compound to form a thio-urethane bond, and this resin has a refractive index nd of about 1.60 to 1.67.<br>
Furthermore, Patent Document 2 describes a resin obtained by thermal ring-opening polymerization of a thioepoxy compound to form an epithiosulfide bond, and this resin has a refractive index nd of 1.70 or higher.<br>
Meanwhile, although the lenses made of resins have advantages as described above, they are highly inferior to glass lenses in surface hardness and scratch resistance. Thus, as one of measures to handle the problem, it has been essential to perform a hard coating treatment to prevent any scratch from forming on the surface of a lens. As a method of such hard coating treatments, many methods of curing a composition including a polyfunctional (meth)acrylate monomer or oligomer and a radical photopolymerization initiator with ultraviolet ray have been investigated, and various hard coating agents for PC and PMMA have been developed and are widely used for industrial purposes.<br>
However, there still remain the following problems.<br>
[1] A hard coating agent including a polyfunctional (meth)acrylate monomer or oligomer having a functionality of 3 or higher as the main component, has good hard coatability because a<br><br>
cured film formed from the hard coating agent has a high crosslinking density. However, the film formed from the hard coating agent undergoes large shrinkage after curing, and has high residual strain or residual stress. Thus, the hard coating agent may not have sufficient adhesion depending on the resin on which the hard coating agent is applied. Particularly, in the case of the above-described thiourethane resin and thioepoxy resin, it is known to be difficult to obtain sufficient adhesion.<br>
[2] From the viewpoint of the recent attempts to reduce the burden on the environment as much as possible, in order to reduce the use of volatile solvents and to enable the recovery and recycling of liquids to reduce waste materials, there will be a demand in the future for a hard coating agent which does not contain any diluting solvents. But, since polyfunctional (meth)acrylate monomers and oligomers having a functionality of 3 or higher generally have high viscosities, diluting solvents are needed. To decrease the viscosity without using any diluting solvent, a method of using a monofunctional (meth)acrylate monomer having a functionality of 2 or lower as a reactive diluent can be used. However, the hard coating agent using the monomer often does not undergo complete curing, since the agent is likely to be inhibited from polymerizing by oxygen. Even though curing occurs, because the crosslinking density decreases almost proportionally to the amount of the monofunctional monomer, there is a problem that high hard coatability cannot be obtained.<br>
Thus, a method of performing cationic polymerization induced by light is being investigated. Cationic photopolymerization is advantageous over radical photopolymerization, in the points of not<br><br>
being affected by the inhibition of polymerization by oxygen, and having relatively excellent adhesion due to the small shrinkage of the produced film during curing when an epoxy compound or an oxetane compound is used as the monomer. However, under the current circumstances, sufficient hard coatability cannot be obtained.<br>
In addition, Patent Document 3 describes a composition including a cationic photopolymerizable silsesquioxane compound (a), a photocationic compound (b) other than (a), and a cationic photopolymerization initiator (c). Specific examples of the photocationic compound (b) include ethyl vinyl ether and the like as those having a vinyloxy group; bisphenol F diglycidyl ether and the like as those having an epoxy group; and<br>
1,4-bis[(3-ethyl-3-oxetanylmethoxy)methyl]benzene and the like as those having an oxetanyl group. Such a composition tends to have a decreased curing rate, when the proportion of the cationic photopolymerizable silsesquioxane (a) is increased to impart hard coatability.  Thus, the composition cannot have sufficient hard coatability, and cannot have adhesion to thiourethane resins or thioepoxy resins. Moreover, the cationic photopolymerizable silsesquioxane (a) generally has a high viscosity even in a liquid phase, and consequently, the composition has an increased viscosity, resulting in deteriorating smoothness as a film.<br>
Even if a hard coating agent which addresses the above-described problems could be obtained, the thiourethane resins and thioepoxy resins used as the substrate are in general known to have poor weather resistance. Thus, the substrates themselves may undergo cohesive failure under exposure to sunlight or rain, and as a result, there<br><br>
still remains aproblemof deterioration in the adhesion of thehardcoat formed from the hard coating agent.<br>

Disclosure of the Invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a hard coating agent which has high adhesion to a thiourethane resin or a resin obtained by thermal ring-opening polymerization of a thioepoxy compound, high surface hardness and scratch resistance.

poly (methyl) glycidyl ether compound represented by the Formula (1) : <br>
(Formula Removed)<br>

According to the invention, the component (A) is preferably a poly(methyl)glycidyl ether compound which may contain a hydroxyl group, which compound is derived from a chain aliphatic polyol or a chain aliphatic polyether polyol. The component (A) is a compound having at least two or more of (methyl)glycidyl ether groups, and can be prepared by various methods. A method of performing condensation by dehydrochlorination of a chain aliphatic polyol or a chain aliphatic polyether polyol having at least two or more of hydroxyl groups, represented by Formulas (11) to (17), and (methyl) epichlorohydrin represented by Formula (18), in the presence of a basic compound, is generally used.<br>

wherein p is an integer from 1 to 10; q is an integer from 0 to 10; r and s are each independently an integer from 0 to 10; t, u and v are each independently an integer from 0 or 1 to 10; and R36 and R37 each independently represent hydrogen or an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms.<br>

A compound having only one (methyl) glycidyl ether group in the structure has insufficient curing rate or hard coatability. A compound having a hydroxyl group in the structure would be acceptable if the compound contains two or more (methyl)glycidyl ether groups, and there would be no adverse effect on the curing rate, hard coatability and adhesion.<br>
These compounds are used individually or in combination of two or more species.<br>
The silsesquioxane compound containing a cationic polymerizable group as the component (B) according to the invention will be described. According to the invention, any silsesquioxane compound containing a cationic polymerizable group may be used, and there is no particular limitation thereon. (The cationic polymerizable group will be described later).<br>
A silsesquioxane compound is a silane compound having a fundamental skeleton of Formula (19), which is obtained by hydrolyzing a trifunctional silane such as alkoxysilane, chlorosilane, silanol<br><br><br>
or the like. The compound is known to have an irregular form called random structure, as well as a ladder form, a cage structure (completely fused cage structure) or a partially open structure (a structure mis sing a portion of the silicon atoms from the cage structure, or a structure having a part of the silicon-oxygen bonds in the cage structure cleaved) , and the like.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R represents an organic group.<br>
Among those, the silsesguioxane referred to as the cage-shaped structure has excellent hard coatability, and it is preferable that this cage structure silsesquioxane is included in the silsesquioxane. This structure is represented by, for example,<br>
(i) a closed type cage-shaped-like silsesquioxane: <br>
(Sequence Removed)<br>
(ii) a partially open type cage-shaped-like silsesquioxane:<br>
(Sequence Removed)<br><br>
wherein n represents an integer from 6 to 18; m represents 0 to 3; and R10 to R12 each represent a cationicpolymerizable group/ hydrogen, an alkyl group, a cyclopentyl group, or a cyclohexyl group.<br>
(i) The value of n in the silsesquioxane of a closed type cage-shaped-like structure represented by Formula (4) is an even number of from 6 to 18, preferably from 6 to 14, more preferably 8, 10 or 12, and even more preferably 8, or a mixture of 8, 10 and 12.<br>
For example, it is known that (i-1): when n is 6, the silsesquioxane has a triangular prismatic structure; (i-2): when n<br><br><br>
is 8, the silsesquioxane has a hexahedral structure; (i-3): when n is 10, the silsesquioxane has a pentagonal prismatic structure; (i-4) : when n is 12, the silsesquioxane has an octahedral structure; and (i-5): when n is 14, the silsesquioxane has an enneahedral structure (they are represented by Formulas (20) to (24)).<br>

(ii) The partially open structure of the cage structure represented by the Formula (5) represents (ii-l) : a structure missing a portion of the silicon atoms from the cage structure, or (ii-2) : a structure having a part of the silicon-oxygen bonds in the cage structure cleaved. The value of n is 6 to 18, and preferably 6 to 14 (they are represented by Formulas (25) to (29)).<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The cage-shaped-like silsesquioxane may be a closed type cage-shaped-like structure or a partially open structure, and has no problem in view of hard coatability as long as the silsesquioxane has a cage-shaped form.<br>
Among the organic groups in the compound, it is desirable if at least one of the organic groups includes a cationic polymerizable group. For the closed type cage-shaped-like structure containing a cationic polymerizable group, the closed type cage-shaped-like silsesquioxane represented by the Formula (6) may be mentioned to be preferable, and for the partially open structure of the cage structure containing a cationic polymerizable group, the partially open type cage-shaped-like silsesquioxane represented by the Formula (7) may be mentioned to be preferable.<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R13 to R30 each represent a cationic polymerizable group, hydrogen, an alkyl group, a cyclopentyl group, or a cyclohexyl group. The cationic polymerizable group is not particularly limited, but a preferred cationic polymerizable group may be exemplified by a group having a (methyl)glycidyl ether group (a group containing (2-methyl)oxirane), an oxetanyl group, an epoxy cyclohexyl group, or a vinyl group.

PSS-Octa((3-propylglycidylether)-Dimethylsiloxy) substituted (reagent by Sigma-Aldrich, Inc.), which is disclosed in the Internet on a website of the following address: <http : sigma-aldrich. co. jp pdf>, oxetanylsilsesquioxane (OX-SQ), oxetanylsilsesquioxane (OX-SQ-H) (trade names by Toagosei, Co., Ltd.; trade name) , which are disclosed in Toagosei Research Annual, TREND, 1999, No. 3 and Toagosei Research Annual, TREND, 2004, No. 7, and the like,   which can be suitably used.    This cationic polymerizable<br><br>
silsesquioxane is compatible with cationic polymerizable compounds, unlike silica nanoparticles that are perfectly inorganic materials, and thus, the cationic polymerizable silsesquioxane is easy to handle and is excellent in moldability during film forming and the like. The silicate compound, which is the component (C) according to the invention, will be described. The silicate compound used in the invention is a compound having a fundamental skeleton of the Formula (2), which is obtained by partially hydrolyzing tetrafunctional alkoxysilane.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R3 to R6 are each independently an organic group having a cationic polymerizable group, hydrogen or an alkyl group; and n2 represents an integer from 2 to 10.<br>
For the Formula (2), R3 to R6 each independently represent an organic group having a cationic polymerizable group, hydrogen or an alkyl group.<br>
The alkyl group as defined above is not particularly limited, but may be more specifically exemplified by a methyl group, an ethyl group, an n-propyl group, an isopropyl group, an n-butyl group, an isobutyl group, a t-butyl group, an n-amyl group, an isoamyl group, a hexyl group, an octyl group, a cyclohexyl group, or the like.<br>
For the definition in the above, an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms may be favorablymentioned, and specific examples thereof include a methyl group, an ethyl group, an n- or i-propyl group, an<br><br>
n-, i- or t-butyl group, or the like.<br>
Since this silicate compound is compatible with cationic polymerizable compounds, unlike silica nanoparticles that are perfectly inorganicmaterials, this silicate compound is easy to handle and is excellent in moldability during film forming and the like.<br>
Here, the silicate compound containing a cationic polymerizable group, which contains at least one or more cationic polymerizable groups on R3 to R6, can be prepared by an alcohol exchange reaction of an alkoxy silicate and a cationic polymerizable group-containing alcohol compound. The cationic polymerizable group is not particularly limited, but as a preferred cationic polymerizable group, a group including a methyl glycidyl ether group (a group containing (2-methyl)oxirane), an oxetanyl group, an epoxycyclohexyl group or a vinyl group may be mentioned.<br>
The silicate containing a cationic polymerizable group according to the invention may be exemplified by silicate containing a (methyl) glycidyl ether group (a group containing (2-methyl) oxirane), silicate containing an oxetanyloxy group, silicate containing an epoxycyclohexyloxy group, or the like. From the viewpoints of curability, hard coatability, adhesion, easy availability of the compound, and the like, silicates having the cationic polymerizable groups represented by Formulas (34) and (35) are preferred.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R42 represents hydrogen or a methyl group; and R43 represents<br><br>
a methyl group or an ethyl group.<br>
In addition, an alkoxysilicate which is not substituted with a cationic polyrnerizable group also can form a three-dimensional network structure by producing silanol under ultraviolet irradiation in the presence of a Lewis acid-generating type cationic photopolymerization initiator, and then forming siloxane bonds, and thus, the alkoxysilicate can be used for the invention.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R represents an organic group.<br>

Preparation Example 5<br>
Octa[2-(Butoxymethyl)oxirane-dimethylsiloxy]-silsesquioxan e represented by Formula (46), which is a closed cage-structured silsesquioxane having a cationic polymerizable group represented by Formula (31), as the component (B), was prepared in advance by the<br><br>
following method.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
10 g (9.84 mmol) of octadimethylsiloxy-silsesquioxane represented by Formula (47) (a reagent from Sigma-Aldrich Co.) was dissolved in dry toluene under a moisture-proof environment, and then 10ml (78. 72 mmol) of allyl glycidyl ether (a reagent from Sigma-Aldrich Co.) was added thereto dropwise with stirring. Then, 10 ml of a 2 mM solution of a platinum-1,3-divinyl-l,1,3,3-tetramethyldisiloxane complex (0[Si (CH3) 2CH=CH2] Pt) (diluted in xylene) as a catalyst was further added dropwise to the mixture.  The mixture was heated to 50°C under a nitrogen stream, and the reaction was carried out. The reaction was continued for 24 hours or longer, and the reaction was terminated after confirming that the absorption of Si-H (near 2250 cm-1) disappeared in FTIR. Thereafter, toluene was distilled off using a rotary evaporator. About 17 g of viscous but transparent octa[2-(butoxymethyl)oxirane-dimethylsiloxy]-silsesquioxane was obtained.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Interpretation Example 1<br><br>
The FTIR measurement results for octa[2-(butoxymethyl)oxirane-dimethylsiloxy]-silsesquioxane are shown in Fig. 1. Peaks characteristic to the Si-O-Si bonding were observed at 1090 cm-1 and 1035 cm-1. A  peak characteristic to Si-OH near 3300 cm"1 was not observed.  The 29Si-NMR measurement results are shown in Fig. 2. A very sharp peak was observed near -100 ppm.  This sharp peak is believed to be originating from a regular structure, that is, the cage-shaped-like silsesquioxane structure. The molecular weight was investigated by GPC, and was found to be Mn = 2110 and Mw = 2270 (Mw/Mn = 1. 07) , which are approximately consistent with the value 1930 of the molecular weight calculated from the Formula (46) .  From these, it was confirmed that<br>
octa[2-(butoxymethyl)oxirane-dimethylsiloxy]-silsesquioxane having a closed cage-shaped-like structure was obtained by the Preparation Example 5.<br>
Interpretation Example 2<br><br>
To specify the structure of silsesquioxane having an oxetanyl group: OX-SQ-H (Toagosei Co., Ltd. ) , an interpretation was conducted by the following method. The FTIR measurement results of OX-SQ-H<br><br>
are shown in Fig. 3. Peaks characteristic to the Si-O-Si bonding were observed at 1090 cm-1 and 1035 cm-1, while a peak characteristic to Si-OH was observed at 3335 cm-1. The 29Si-NMR measurement results are shown in Fig. 4. Very sharp peaks ware observed near -48ppm, -57ppm, and -66ppm. These sharp peaks are believed to be originating from a regular structure, that is, a cage-shaped-like silsesquioxane structure. From the above interpretation results, it was believed that OX-SQ-H includes at least a partially open type cage-shaped-like silsesquioxane having a silanol group, or a mixture of a closed type cage-shapedrlike silsesquioxane and a partially open type cage-shaped-like silsesquioxane having a silanol group.<br>

The samples prepared by forming films of the compositions of Examples 1 to 15 and Comparative Examples 1 to 9 respectively on the resin plate of Preparation Example 1, were exposed using a sunshine weather meter employing a carbon arc lamp and a sunshine weather meter employing a xenon lamp (both from Suga Test Instruments Co., Ltd.) for 30 hours, and then were examined for any changes in the adhesion. The adhesion was evaluated by the same method as described in the "[5] Adhesion test" section.<br>
In addition, when a sample was found to be disqualified in the [5] adhesion test, the sample was not subjected to the present test.<br>
[9] Hot water resistance<br><br>
The samples prepared by forming films of the compositions of Examples 1 to 15 and Comparative Examples 1 to 9 respectively on the resin plate of Preparation Example 1, were immersed in hot water at 90°C for 2 hours, and were examined for any changes in the external appearance.<br>
A: No changes in the external appearance<br>
B: Some changes such as swelling and the like observed in the film<br>
C: Cracks observed in the film<br>

If determined to be poor in the Adhesion test [5], Weather resistance test [8] was not performed<br>
For the samples of Examples 1 to 15, good results were obtained for the evaluation of the items [1] to [9] . In Example 2 and 4 where a closed cage-shaped-like silsesquioxane:<br>
octa [2-(butoxymethyl)oxirane-dimethylsiloxy]-silsesquioxane was used as a part of the silsesquioxane component, an improvement of scratch resistance could be seen.  It is assumed that the silsesquioxane of a closed cage-shaped-like structure had an effective action on the improvement of scratch resistance. The hard coating agent prepared in Example 1 was applied on quartz glass, and the light transmittance thereof was measured. The measurement results are plotted in Fig. 4.  The transmittance of visible light of 400 ran or longer was 90% or greater, while ultraviolet light of 350 ran or shorter was mostly intercepted. As a result of not adding 2,2 ' , 4,4'-tetrahydrbxybenzophenone, which is a<br>
2-hydroxybenzophenone-based ultraviolet absorber, in Examples 13 and 14, when a carbon arc lamp was used in weather resistance test, peeling-off of the films was observed to a small extent, but not to an extent to cause any problems. In the case of Example-15, slight peeling off of the film was observed even when a xenon lamp was used, as compared with the cases of Examples 1 to 14 where ultraviolet absorbers were added. However, the evaluation of the weather resistance test resulted in A, not having any problem.  The light transmittance was also measured in Example 15, likewise in Example 1. The measurement results are presented in Fig. 5 . It is contemplated that since ultraviolet rays of 350 nm or shorter are not obstructed,<br><br>
photodegradation of thiourethane resins proceeded, and the adhesion was decreased. In the Comparative Example 1, bisphenol A diglycidyl ether was used as an aromatic diglycidyl ether replacing the component (A), and as a result, the resulting film showed insufficient scratch resistance. In the Comparative Example 2, 2-(3,4-epoxycyclohexyl) carboxylate was used as an alicyclic epoxy compound replacing the component (A) , and as a result, the film showed insufficient adhesion and scratch resistance. In the Comparative Example 3, the component<br>
(A)	was not added, and as a result, the resulting film showed<br>
insufficient adhesion. In the Comparative Example 4, the component<br>
(B)	was not added, and as a result, the resulting film showed clouding<br>
with insufficient transparency, and also insufficient water<br>
resistance.  In the Comparative Example 5, the component (C) was not<br>
added, and as a result, the resulting film showed slightly insufficient<br>
adhesion.  In the Comparative Example 6, the component (D) was not<br>
added, and as a result, the composition had high viscosity, poor film<br>
forming properties, and the resulting f ilmshowed insufficient scratch<br>
resistance.  In the Comparative Example 7, since the proportion of<br>
the component (A) was high, while the proportions of the components<br>
(B) to (D) were low, the resulting film showed insufficient scratch<br>
resistance. The acrylic coating composition of the Comparative<br>
Example 8 showed insufficient adhesion and poor curability, and the<br>
resulting film showed slightly insufficient scratch resistance. Also,<br>
the composition' s high viscosity led to poor film forming properties.<br>
The acrylic coating agent of the Comparative Example 9 had a lower<br>
viscosity than the coating composition of the Comparative Example<br>
8, and thus, the film forming properties were good. However, the<br><br>
coating agent showed remarkably poor curability, and the resulting film showed remarkably poor scratch resistance and adhesion.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
The composition of the invention includes a poly(methyl)glycidyl ether compound, a silsesquioxane compound containing a cationic polymerizable group, a silicate compound, a silane compound or a partial condensated compound thereof, and a cationic photopolymerization initiator, as the essential components. Since the composition can form a coat layer having excellent scratch resistance when cured with ultraviolet radiation, the composition is useful for the use'in a coating agent and the optical material field, specifically for the use in preventing reflection in the hardcoat of spectacle lenses, plasma displays, liquid crystal displays, EL displays and the like, for the use in the optical members for reading high density optical' recording media, optical filters and the like, and for the use in a surface coating agent for improving the designability of plastic materials, metallic materials, ceramic materials, glass materials and the like.<br>
In particular, since the composition has excellent scratch resistance and adhesion to be used as a hard coating agent for the surfaces of thiourethane resins and thioepoxy resins, the composition can be widely utilized as a hard coating agent for spectacle lenses, camera lenses, pickup lenses for optical recording and regenerating devices, and the like.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
