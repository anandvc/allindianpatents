				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a water purification system and ,in particular, to a safe and reliable storage water filter cum purifier. Importantly, the storage water filter cum purifler of the invention is adapted for point of use purification based on ultraviolet disinfection module adapted for ensuring convenient and purified discharge of drinking water as and when the user desires . The filter cum purifier of the invention is simple and cost effective and can be readily and widely used for providing safe and contamination free drinking water especially providing drinking water free from water borne pathogenic bacteria and viruses.<br>
Background Art<br>
It is a matter of regular concern to provide water for consumption in a form which would filter both particulate contaminants and also destroy harmful bacteria and viruses since such contamination which are usually found in available water sources are harmful and can cause diseases and affect the health and well being of individuals. Due to such need for purified water, there has been a continuous requirement in the art to develop water filters and purifiers which would enable providing safe and purified drinking water for maintaining the health and well being of individuals.<br>
Water purifiers/filters are available for various purposes and various varieties of such water filters are already in use to purify/filter water to make it safe for drinking. Importantly, the purifiers and filters which are mostly in use can be categorized as (i) on-line water filters which operate under on line continuous supply of water to be purified and (ii) storage water filters which purify, stored waters under gravity flow and once exhausted is again filled for fresh purification and gravity based flow and storage as purified water for consumption as and when required. Considering that on-line water filters essentially require on-line water supply sources the use of such water filters therefore require pressurized water supply for on-line purification which obviously limit the areas of application and possible uses of such water filters apart from complexities in its provision and operation. On the other hand, the storage water filters do not require any such on-line water supply sources and water from any sources can be filtered and purified using such storage filters.Usually such<br>
storage filters comprise of two containers/chambers one above the other where water to be purified is first fed into the top chamber and thereafter the water is allowed to flow under gravity through various filter/purification media to get treated and finally stored in a bottom container/chamber for discharge as purified water as and when required by the user for drinking /consumption.<br>
The above dearly and sufficiently reveal the possible wide scale use and application of storage water filters as devices of water purification which can be obtained and provide for cost effectively for filtering and purification of water. Importantly, since such storage water filters usually act under gravity and do not require expensive gadgets or on line complexities such storage water filter have huge demand and can be used also in remote locations where on line supply of water is either not available or scarce.<br>
While storage water filter cum purifier are known and available to the art most of this water filter cum purifier involve the use of resin as a purification media. Such resin filtrations are convenient for users who do not have supply of running water sources and is ,therefore, widely in use. However, such resin based storage water filter cum purifier presently in use have some limitations and accordingly, its use and application is some times either not acceptable or reliable to generate safe and quality drinking water. In particular, such type of storage water filter cum purifier are found not capable to work at extreme dimatic condition such below 5° C and above 30° C. Therefore, in regions where such extreme climatic conditions prevail use of such resin based filter cum purifiers are not found suitable. Moreover, it is also found that in case of use of such resin based purification media involving storage water filter cum purifiers the filter water usually have a tinge of iodine smell and taste. Such smell and taste of iodine in water is found also to affect the desired plain and usual taste of water to which people are used to and accordingly such resin base water filters are some times not acceptable or to be desired liking of consumers/users.<br>
Added to the above, the resin based purification also involve complexities due to the fact that the user does not know whether the life of the purification media i.e. the effective life of the resin used for purification is exhausted or not. Therefore, in case the purifying media and in particular its effective life span is exhausted the<br>
purification media looses its purpose and the water generated by such exhausted purification media is obviously untreated and totally unsafe for consumption. In order to meet such problem or difficulty of the user to know about the effective fife of purification media various gadgets/devices have been proposed in such purification system wherein the life of the purification media and its effectiveness is calculated based on the water usage i.e. the amount of water flowing through the media which needed to be monitored by the user using such system. However, such gadgets/means provided in water purification devices simply add to the complexities of generating purified water and are not user friendly and therefore, have problems in maintenance as well as in its wide scale use and application as a storage water filter cum purifiers.<br>
Objects of the Invention<br>
It is thus basic object of present invention to provide a storage water filter cum purifier which would be user friendly and avoid the problems and complexities of such storage water filter cum purifier involving resin based purification discussed above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide storage water filter cum purifier, which would be adapted to work even at extreme climatic condition such as below 5° C and above 30° C.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is directed to storage water filter cum purifier which would avoid the need for resin based purification and therefore favour generating purified water from storage water filter cum purifier without affecting the desired plain and simple usual taste of water especially provide it in a form free of any tinge of iodine taste and smell.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to provide for a system of storage water filter cum purifier which would avoid the problem of loss of effective life of the purification media and/or the complexities of monitoring the effective life of purification media by the user and thereby facilitate generating safe and pure drinking water by way of a user friendly and reliable system of filtration and purification of drinking water.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is directed to providing storage water filter cum purifier involving selective and advantageous ultra violet disinfections means whereby point of use purification based on ultra violet disinfections to destroy water borne pathogenic bacteria viruses can be attained and thereby ensuring safe and quality drinking water for maintaining desired health and well being of individual.<br>

(iii) Finally, the filtered and chlorine free water is put to a final point of use purification in an ultra violet disinfection module selectively disposed there under said bottom chamber for destroying water borne pathogenic bacteria and viruses.<br>
Importantly, in the above water filter cum purifier the purification is complete and reliable and is also to the satisfaction of the user due to point of use purification based on ultra violet disinfection module. The user for the purpose of discharging safe purified water for consumption is required to power ON the ultra violet module and withdraw the water by opening of the tap only after the speculated processing time of treatment of the water in the ultra violet module is over. Such processing time can be conveniently indicated to the user through visual control to ensure supply of complete safe and pure drinking water to the user.<br>
In the above disclosed storage water filter cum purifier of the invention, the top container is provided with filtration cum carbon absorption stage. Such a provision enables initial pouring of the water to be treated into the top chamber, which goes to particulate filtration, sediment filtration and carbon absorption stages for the pre-treatment purposes. The particulate filter at the inlet port of the top container is adapted to arrest the bigger particles like dust, dirt and physical impurities and allow the water to get collected in the top container. Thereafter, the water flows to the sediment filter (for trapping fine sediments) to the carbon absorption module fixed at the outlet port of the top container to absorb the chemical impurities, chlorine,<br>
organics, chlorination by-products and colour of the water. The pre-treatment water flows to the bottom container.<br>

Importantly, the storage water filter cum purifier of the invention advantageously provides for a selective ultra violet disinfection stage at the point of use of the consumer. Such selective ultra violet disinfection base water purification at the point of use ensures safe and economical generation of pure drinking water of good quality and taste.<br>
The water flow through the selective ultra violet disinfection module ensures the maximum exposure of ultra violet rays to the water during the flow. The ultra violet lamp fixed inside the module emits ultra violet rays for disinfection by destroying water borne pathogenic bacteria and viruses.<br>
Brief Description of the Accompanying Figure<br>
The details of the invention, its objects and advantages are explained hereunder in greater detail in relation to non-limiting exemplary illustration as per the accompanying figure 1 illustrating and embodiment of the storage water filter cum purifier system of the invention.<br>
Reference is invited to accompanying Figure 1 which illustrates the system comprising of the top chamber (1), the bottom chamber (2) and final point of use ultra violet disinfection module (3). As further illustration in said figure the top container (1) is provided with particulate filter (1A), sediment filter (IB) and Carbon absorption stage (1C).<br>
The particuiate filter (1A) at the inlet port of the top chamber (1) is adapted to arrest the bigger particles like dust, dirt and physical impurities and allow the water to get collected in the top chamber (1). The water flows through the sediment filter (IB) for trapping fine sediments and further through the carbon absorption module (1C) at the outlet port of the top chamber to absorb chemical impurities, chlorine, organics, chlorination by-products and colour of the water. The pre-treated water from the top chamber (1) enters the bottom chamber (2). Finally, the outlet of the bottom chamber (2) is shown connected to the ultra violet disinfection module (3) through a special connector cum non-return valve. The ultra-violet disinfection module is operatively connected to tap means (4) for the consumer to open the tap and collect safe drinking water after desired point of use purification through the ultra-violet disinfection module.<br>
Importantly, the ultra violet disinfection module is selectively disposed to ensure maximum exposure of ultra violet rays to water during the flow. The ultra violet lamp fixed inside the module is adapted to emit to 253.7 wavelengths, which is sufficient to deactivate the disease-causing microorganism.<br>
The user of the system is required to power on the ultra violet module for disinfection purposes and withdraw the water only after the speculated process time is over. This process time can be preferably indicated through visual controls. The user after switching on a power switch to ignite the UV lamp is supposed to wait till a green LED glows indicating completion of purification for withdrawing purified water. A red LEO can be adapted and operatively connected to glow when the UV lamp is faulty or needs servicing.<br>
It is thus possible by way of the above system of invention to provide dear and chlorine free water in the bottom chamber after its passage through the particuiate filter, sediment filter and the carbon absorption stages to thereby ensure best level of pre-treatment to the water. A final stage of ultra violet purification ensures the point of use disinfection, which does not have post contamination. The system is therefore safe, cost effective and favours generation of safe and quality drinking water free from water borne pathogenic bacteria and viruses.<br>
