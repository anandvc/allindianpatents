				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a spiced low fat spread.<br>
This invention relates to a special low fat spread, in which solids mainly pulses and/or spices are dispersed in a continuous fat phase and the product is suitable for use as a spread with traditional breakfast foods and bread and biscuits.<br>
Normally, a fat spread is a product in the form of water in oil emulsion. This is true in the case of butter or margarine like fat spreads. Reference may be made to low fat spreads containing 0.1 to 20% fat emulsion containing hydrolyzed starch (Underdown, Jeffrey, USP 5 656 323 (1997) and also the low fat spread comprising 0.1 to 10% gelatin, 0.1 to 7% gelled polysaccharide and 10-60% fat (Norton, Ian T, USP 5 508 056 (1996).<br>
Reference may also be made to a process of making low fat spread having atleast 56% water, 0.01 to10% microcrystalline cellulose, 0.1 to 2% gum and continuous phase comprising no more than 20 wt% oil (Humphreys, William M, USP 5 338 562(1994).<br>
Reference may be made to a low fat spread which is water in oil emulsion comprising aqueous phase, containing 6% proteins derived from milk and 1.3 to 4% modified starch and 18 to 37% fat phase (Gupta, Bharat B; Piatt, Brian L, USP 4 990 355(1991).<br>
Reference may be made to a proteinaceous low fat spread relating to water in oil type containing 30-50% fat and a dispersed protein aqueous phase containing 0.01 to 2% phosphatides and 2-8% protein ingredient (Sundstroem Kurt Lage, Moran David patrick Joseph, USP 4 07/634(1978).<br>
Reference may also be made to method of preparation of low calorie fat spread with a fat content of 20-60%, water phase containing 0.1 to 5% gelatin or agar-agar and 0.1 to 5% of soluble starch (Ebskamp, Hermanus, J.G., USP 5 093 144 (1992).<br>
Reference may also made to low calorie low fat spread with 10-25% fat containing milk concentrate, butter milk powder salts and stabilizers (C. Schott, A. Miller, German Federal Republic Patent Application DE 3 710 152 A1 (1988).<br>
Reference may be made to stabilizing and emulsifying composition for preparation of fat reduced spread with 20-50% fat containing 70-85% gelatin, 7.5 to 15% iota carrageenan and 7.5 to 15% xanthan (J. Poppe, R. Bizotti, G. Tilly, French Patent Application 2 656 773 A1 (1991).<br>
The drawbacks of the above mentioned literature are: these spreads are based on emulsions containing water and oil with added stabilizers and more like butter or margarine. However, the present investigation relates to fat spreads devoid of water. It consists of a continuous fat phase with solids dispersed in it as in peanut butter.<br>
Patented literature is available on the effects of various stabilizing agents and processing parameters on the quality of peanut butter.<br>
Reference may be made to method of making reduced fat peanut butter product containing 0 to 50% peanut meal and 0 to 50% peanut paste (B.J.Rudan, M.L.Yang, A.M.MiIler, S.P.Lambardo, R.K.Moroz, L.B.Deffenbaugh, D.W. Mehnert, J. Peluso, R.G.Krishnamurthy, USP 5 366 754 (1994) and also by removing oil from ground peanuts (K.K. Franklin, USP 5 302 409 9 (1994).<br>
Reference may also be made to preparation of reduced fat peanut butter compositions as a water in oil emulsion containing a continuous peanut butter oil<br>
phase, a protein complexing agent and a discontinuous aqueous coagulated protein phase (Izzo, H.J, R.E. Lieberman, USP 5 240 734 (1993).<br>
Reference may also be made to reduced calorie peanut butter product containing 15-40% solid bulking agent such as polydextrose &amp;/or microcrystalline cellulose (Yokoyama W.H., M.S.Fraser, LLKhatri, USP 4 814 195 (1989).<br>
Reference may also be made to process of making a sweetened and flavored peanut butter containing sugar and flavoring agents (C.Chozianin, C.R.Luce, H.W.Zukerman, USP 3 978 246 (1976).<br>
Reference may also be made to a reduced fat peanut butter containing ground peanuts and native starch from chickpea (Finnochiaro, E.T., USP 5 549 923 (1996).<br>
The drawbacks of the above literature on peanut butter are: the products constitutes mainly peanuts as solid phase with added oil/fat and stabilizers and area not compatible with most of the Indian traditional breakfast foods and hence are not popular in India. The present invention relates to a special low fat spread, which differs from both margarine like spreads and peanut butter in composition, taste and in processing. The legumes or pulses and spices constitute the major solid phase unlike in peanut butter and a special fat blend as a continuous fat phase in the present special spread. It also differs in processing, as it involves mixing and grinding solids to coarser particles using simple domestic grinding machine.<br>
There is no literature on the preparation of low fat spreads based on pulses, spices as the solid phase and a continuous fat phase without water being present in the spread. The present invention relates to the product, where in solids are dispersed in continuous fat phase. The present invention differs from that of peanut<br>
butter in composition and addition of particular type of fat and chilling operations during preparation. Also, the process differs with that of the latter in utilizing the type of grinder and the degree of fineness , i.e., the particle size of the solids. In peanut butter, only peanuts constitute the solid phase and are ground to a very fine particle size. In the present investigation, the domestic wet grinder is used to grind to medium size particles. In addition, the present invention differs from low fat butter or margarine like fat spreads in the processing and in composition. The present invention relates to preparation of a special type of plain or spiced low fat spread, in which solid phase consists of pulses, nuts and/or spices. A special type of fat blend forms the continuous phase.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of low fat spread, which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above and suitable for Indian traditional breakfast foods and bakery products.<br>
Another objective of the invention is to prepare spiced low fat spread so as to suit Indian palate and breakfast foods.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to prepare a special fat blends based on hydrogenated vegetable fats and vegetable oils suitable for preparation of low fat spread having good spreadabiiity and stability.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, a low fat spread is prepared having pulses, spices, including salt, tamarind solids and chillies as major solid phase with a special fat blend as a continuous phase.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the invention, the solids constitute about 8-9% of desiccated coconut as an additional optional ingredient in the final product.   ..<br>
In accordance with yet another invention, the compatible spiced artificial flavors like onion, garlic, ginger are added to the final product.<br>
In accordance with another invention, amchur, an acidulant used in the North India, is used inplace of tamarind.<br>
The present invention, 'a process for the preparation of low fat spread', consists of solid phase, which consists of legumes, and spices, and a continuous fat phase. The plain product without addition of spices also could be prepared. The details of the formulation and process are described below. The process flow sheet is as follows:<br>

Special low fat Spread Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of a spiced<br>
low fat spread, which comprises blend'ng solid phase 54-58% by wt and,fat phase 42-<br>
46% by wt, where in: Solid phase consisting of Bengalgram dhal: 17-19% by wt; Blackgram dhal: 17-19% by wt.; peanuts: 5.5-6.3% by wt.; Chillies: 1-1.5% by wt.; roasted and ground to 60 mesh size; salt: 2.5-3.0% by wt.; sugar 2-2.5% by wt., preservatives 0.01 to 0.03% by wt. optionally containing savouring agents such as tamarind powder or amchur 3.6-4.0% by wt.; desiccated coconut 8 to 9% by wt.; flavoring agents 150 to 300 ppm and a fat phase mainly containing I) hydrogenated vegetable fats 21 to 23% by wt., 2) vegetable oil 21 to 23% by wt., 3) emulsifiers 0.3 to 0.5% by wt., 4) permitted antioxidants 0.01 to 0.02% by wt., , mixing and grinding all the ingredients and then suddenly chilling to 0°C to 10°C to get the spread.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, two types of hydrogenated vegetable fats, namely conventional type used for culinary purposes and another type normally used for bakery purposes are employed and one of these fats is blended with vegetable oils such as peanut or sunflower or mustard in the proportions ranging from 50-60 to 40 to 50% and the blend is added in the range of 42 to 46% by wt of the product.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the emulsifiers, glyceryl monostearate and lecithin are added in the range of 0.3 to 0.5% by wt of the product.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the stabilizer such as antioxidant is added in the range of 0.01 to 0.015% by wt. and* preservative such as sorbic acid is employed in the range of 0.01 to 0.03% by wt.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the savouring agents such as tamarind powder or dried amchur are added in the ranges 3.6 to 4.0% by wt.<br>
The composition of the present invention is not mere admixture but it shows synergistic properties and thereby this is useful as a spread with traditional breakfast foods and bread &amp; biscuits. There is no chemical reaction in the constituents of the said composition.<br>
The process consists of roasting and milling of Blackgram and Bengalgram dhals and red chillies; roasting and cleaning of peanuts; preparation of the fat blends using hydrogenated fat and liquid oil, addition of emulsifiers and antioxidant to the fat blend and heating to about 50-60°C to get clear liquid; weighing all the ingredients; mixing and grinding in a domestic wet grinder, roller and tillable type; and sudden chilling of the mass to obtain low fat spread.<br>
The low fat spread of the present invention consists of special solid phase including legumes and spices and a special fat blend prepared from hydrogenated vegetable fats and vegetable oils. The product suits Indian palate and is compatible with most of the Indian traditional breakfast/snack foods like Chapati, Poori as well as bread and biscuits. The product could be used as a spread and could also be used as an adjunct with lunch or dinner after dilution with water. The product is stable upto 6 months.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of the present invention and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>

(solid and fat phase) are  mixed and ground in a domestic wet grinder, preferably<br>
roller type for about 30 minutes. The mass was taken out and was suddenly chilled<br>
in ice bath with stirring.<br>
The percent solids of hydrogenated vegetable fats used to prepare the fat blends as determined by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) are as follows:<br>
Vanaspati     Hydrogenated fat (bakery)<br>
at 10°C: 94-99%	90-95%<br>
20°C: 60-70%	80-90%<br>
25°C: 40-50%	60-68%<br>
30°C: 30-40%	30-60%<br>
35°C: 20-25%	10-20%<br>
37°C: 15-20%	5-20%.<br>
This present invention relates to a novel product, which constitutes pulses, spices as major solid phase and a special type of fat blend as a continuous fat phase and the product not only has good spreadability at normal ambient temperature (25°C) and also has good stability against phase separation.<br>
Analyses: The solids content of the fat blends at various temperatures, which influence the consistency and stability of the spread are determined by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). The spread is analyzed for consistency, stability against phase separation and organoleptic evaluation.<br>
Type of fat blend: Blends of vanaspati or bakery fat with liquid oil, which is peanut or sunflower or mustard oils were used. The blends consist of vanaspati 45-70%, especially 50-60% and liquid oil 30-55%, especially 40-50%. In another fat blend, the proportion of bakery fat ranges from 40-60%, especially 50-60% and liquid oil from 40-60%, especially 40-50%. The total fat content in the product varies from 40-46%, preferably 42-44% by wt<br>
of the total product. The consistency of the fat blend, which is a measure of solids content at different temperatures shows solids content: at 10°C : 75-90%; at 20°C : 50-70%; at 25°C: 45-60%; at 30°C : 20-40%; at 37°C: 2-10%; at 40°C : 3-5%.<br>
Consistency of the spread: Spreadability or consistency of the spread was measured by penetration at refrigerated temperature (3-5°C), ambient temperature (26°C) and at 36°C. The results are shown in Table 1.<br>
Table 1: Penetration values of low fat spreads<br>
(Table Removed)  <br>
Oil used: Peanut, Sunflower or Mustard oils. Vanaspati: Conventional hydrogenated fat.<br>
The spreads are stored in test tubes at 26°C and 36°C and periodically observed for oil separation and the results are presented in Table 2.<br>
Table 2: Phase separation of Chutney spreads on storage<br>
(Table Removed)  <br>
It can be seen from Tables 1 that the spreadability of the spread could be improved by suitably altering the proportions of oil and fat and also the total fat content could be reduced. However, the spreads containing higher proportions of liquid oil in the blends, had poor stability against phase separation (Table 2). The fat blend consisting of vanaspati or bakery fat in the proportions of 40-70%, preferably 50-70% is found to be suitable for the preparation of special low fat spread.<br>
The main advantages of the present invention are:<br>
1.	The product suits as a spread on bread and biscuit.<br>
2.	The product mainly suits as a spread with most of the traditional breakfast/snack foods<br>
like Chapati, Pooh.<br>
3.	The product also could be used as a food adjunct with lunch or dinner after dilution with<br>
water. It homogeneously mixes with water.<br><br><br><br><br>
We claim:<br>
