				<td>Title: Improvements relating to skin dressings<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to skin dressings for application to a part of a human or animal body<br>
for treatment of skin (for therapeutic or cosmetic purposes), and relates particularly (but not<br>
exclusively) to wound dressings for treatment of compromised skin, particularly skin lesions,<br>
Le. any interruption in the surface of the skin, whether caused by injury or disease, including<br>
skin ulcers, burns, cuts, punctures, lacerations, blunt traumas, acne lesions, boils etc. The<br>
term "skin dressing" covers dressings such as patches, plasters, bandages and gauze etc. for<br>
use in connection with transdermal delivery of agents. The term also includes material in<br>
amorphous or liquid form. The term covers dressings for application to body surfaces<br>
generally, including internal and external tissues, particularly the skin including the scalp.<br>
The invention is based on the beneficial properties of nitric oxide (NO).<br>
Background to the Invention<br>
Under normal conditions, nitric oxide (NO) is a short-lived, unstable gaseous substance. Its<br>
instability is due to the unpaired electron of nitrogen. As an unstable substance with an<br>
unpaired electron, nitric oxide can be described as a free radical. However, compared with<br>
typical free radicals (e.g. hydroxyl radical or superoxide), whose life-time is in the order of<br>
milliseconds, nitric oxide is relatively stable. Typically, it is converted to a more stable<br>
chemical species within seconds of its production. Thus, for example, if gaseous nitric oxide<br>
contacts air, it reacts rapidly with oxygen to generate nitrogen dioxide as follows:<br>
<br>
Under some conditions, for instance in pure gaseous state, NO can be stored without<br>
significant losses for a very long time. NO is a very hydrophobic compound and its<br>
solubility in water is therefore limited. Maximum solubility in water achievable under<br>
normal conditions is approximately 1.7 mM, the solubility being similar to that of oxygen.<br>
The oxidation of dissolved nitric oxide by dissolved oxygen occurs in aqueous solutions.<br>
Nevertheless, given the rate constants and low concentrations of dissolved NO and 02 this<br>
reaction is considerably less rapid than in the gaseous state, where the concentration of<br>
oxygen is very high.<br>
Nitric oxide can be produced by chemical reduction of nitrous acid. Many different reducing<br>
agents can be used to reduce nitrous acid, physiologically acceptable examples of such<br>
reducing agents include iodide anion, ascorbic acid, butylated quinone, tocopherol etc.<br>
Nitrous acid is a weak acid with pKa 3.4. This means that at pH 3.4 nitrous acid exists as an<br>
equimolar mixture of nitrous acid (HNO2) and nitrite (N(V)- At higher pH the equilibrium<br>
shifts in favour of nitrite anion; at lower pH the equilibrium shifts in favour of nitrous acid.<br>
Since only nitrous acid can be chemically reduced to nitric oxide the efficiency of converting<br>
nitrite into nitric oxide increases with decreasing pH. So, whilst at pH 6 the rate of such<br>
conversion is negligible, it proceeds slowly at pH 5 and is very rapid at pH 
especially at pH 
A special category of reducing agents that react with nitrite in acidic environment are thiols.<br>
Reaction between thiols and nitrite in acidic environment does not result in nitrous acid<br>
reduction and immediate generation of nitric oxide, as in the case of other reducing agents.<br>
Instead, thiols are nitrosylated by nitrosonium cation (NO*) which is another species<br>
generated from nitrite in acidic conditions.<br>
Nitric oxide has a multitude of effects in living tissues. The mechanism of these effects is<br>
nearly always based on interaction of nitric oxide either with a metal component (typically<br>
iron) or with thiol groups of key enzymes and other proteins. Depending on the particular<br>
enzyme, such interaction can lead to either activation or inhibition of the protein. An<br>
example of an effect based on the activation of an enzyme is that of vasodilatation: nitric<br>
oxide binds to the haem iron of the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which results in<br>
conformational change exposing the catalytic site of the enzyme. This leads to catalytic<br>
conversion of GTP to cGMP. This conversion initiates the whole cascade of reactions<br>
leading to protein phosphorylation and muscle relaxation (vasodilatation). Other effects<br>
based on activation of enzymes or growth factors by nitric oxide include stimulation of cell<br>
division (proliferation) and cell maturation, stimulation of cell differentiation and formation<br>
of cell receptors, neovascularisation, formation of fibroblasts in the wound and thereby<br>
enhancement of collagen formation, etc.<br>
Topical delivery of nitric oxide can be a very useful feature in various therapeutic or<br>
cosmetic applications including wound healing, treatment of skin or nail infections, sexual<br>
dysfunction etc.<br>
US 6,103,275 discloses a method for therapeutically applying nitric oxide, the method<br>
comprising bringing together a nitrite salt a reductant and an acid with pKa between 1 and 4<br>
at a body site.<br>
The pH range at which the method should be used is not specified. However, the fact that the<br>
buffer components are referred to as acids may indicate that these compounds are<br>
predominantly present in the protonated form, therefore the pH of the composition should be<br>
substantially lower than 4. The presence of acids with pKa between 1 to 4 ensures good<br>
buffering capacity of the formulation at the required pH. Whilst incorporation of such acids<br>
is a convenient way of ensuring that pH is maintained at a level such that a continuous<br>
efficiency of converting nitrite to nitric oxide is maintained, there are disadvantages of<br>
introducing these acids into the system. Prolonged exposure of skin to any topical<br>
application that is buffered strongly at pH between 1 to 4 is potentially harmful and should<br>
be avoided.<br>
Other nitric oxide releasing systems have been disclosed. For example, US 6,709,681<br>
discloses a method of treating microbial infection, the method comprising mixing acidifying<br>
agent with a source of nitrite. In principle, this method is very similar to that disclosed in<br>
US 6,103,275, i.e. mixing a source of nitrite with acids of pKa between 1 to 4. Importantly,<br>
the absence of strong reducing agents in the formulation disclosed in US 6,709,681 does not<br>
ensure sufficient reducing power in the formulation. Consequently, generation of nitric oxide<br>
will be accompanied by direct generation of nitrogen dioxide according to the following<br>
mechanism:<br>
<br>
Whilst nitric dioxide may exert good antimicrobial properties, it does not have vasodilating<br>
properties nor is it capable of activation of the cell proliferation. It is therefore generally<br>
desirable to stop the direct generation of nitrogen dioxide by incorporating the reducing<br>
agent.<br>
US 2003012816 discloses a biocompatible plymerisable macromer composition comprising<br>
a macromer having at least one nitric oxide carrying region or nitric oxide modulating<br>
compound wherein the nitric oxide or the nitric oxide modulating compound is released from<br>
the macromer and wherein the macromer further comprises one or more regions selected<br>
from the group consisting of a water soluble region, a cell adhesion ligand and a<br>
polymerisable region. The disclosed macromers include acrylolyl-PEG-Cys-NO macromer,<br>
acrylolyl-PEG-Lys5-NO macromer, PEG-DETA-NO macromer, PVA-NH2-NO macromer,<br>
PVA-Cys-NO macromer and PVA-NO-bFGF macromer.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a skin dressing comprising a first component comprising a<br>
source of protons, a second component comprising a nitrite salt, the dressing comprising a<br>
non-thiol reductant, such that, when the first and second components are brought together<br>
and applied to a skin site the nitrite reacts to generate nitric oxide, increasing the pH of the<br>
dressing in contact wim the skin from an acidic value to a more neutral value.<br>
It will be appreciated that nitrite is a compound with pKa of 3.4 (at 25 °C). Thus, nitrite can<br>
act as a buffer in the system, capable of maintaining pH in the range between about 3 to 4.<br>
After bringing the two components together and applied to a skin site the nitrite enters an<br>
acidic environment and nitric oxide generation will start. Importantly, an acidic pH will be<br>
maintained by the nitrite itself. As the nitric oxide generation proceeds and nitrite<br>
concentration decreases, the buffering capacity in the system will decrease. Simultaneously,<br>
protons are consumed during nitrite conversion to nitric oxide. Consequently, the pH of the<br>
activated system will increase closer to neutral values as the nitrite conversion proceeds<br>
toward completion. The system thus exhibits a self-regulation of pH, ensuring milder pH of<br>
the topical application once sufficient build-up of nitric oxide is achieved.<br>
Such self-regulation can occur relatively rapidly or more gradually depending on the<br>
concentrations of actives in the two components of the system. Importantly, the rate of such<br>
self-regulation will be proportional to the rate of nitrite conversion to nitric oxide.<br>
The dressing, typically in use on skin, thus functions as a nitric oxide donor, nitric oxide<br>
being released on or in the vicinity of the skin being treated. This can be achieved whilst<br>
avoiding prolonged exposure of the body site (skin, wound etc.) to an acidic, strongly<br>
buffered, dressing application.<br>
If a quick burst of nitric oxide is required then the pH of the composition immediately after<br>
activation will be relatively low possibly around 3.5, but, because of the low pH, nitrite is<br>
quickly converted to nitric oxide, resulting in a rapid increase in pH. If a more gradual<br>
conversion of nitrite is required then the pH of the composition immediately after activation<br>
will not need to be too acidic (possibly between 4 to 4.5), and the shift toward more neutral<br>
pH values will be more gradual.<br>
For example, if rapid generation of nitric oxide is required in order to achieve a localised<br>
vasodilatation and consequent increase of blood flow then the pH of the formulation<br>
immediately after activation must be such that nitrite is efficiently converted to nitric oxide.<br>
As this reaction proceeds quickly, the pH rises closer to neutral values. Whilst such increase<br>
of pH would slow down or stop the nitrite conversion to nitric oxide, such reaction is no<br>
longer needed because most nitrite has already been converted. The dressing thus exerts a<br>
self-regulating function.<br>
Therefore, as the nitrite reacts to form nitric oxide the pH of the dressing increases. The pH<br>
of the dressing may therefore increase from below 5 to above 5 as the nitrite reacts,<br>
preferably it will increase from below 4 to above 6.<br>
It is also desirable that the nitrite is the only component which has a pKa of from 1 to 4.<br>
Therefore preferably the dressing is free of any additional materials having a pKa of from 1<br>
to 4.<br>
Typically, the first component is acidic and preferably has a pH in the range of from 2 to 5,<br>
more preferably from 3 to 4. The second component may have a pH in the range of from 5<br>
to 12, preferably 6 to 11 and more preferably from 7 to 10. A small amount of buffer with a<br>
pKa e.g. in the range of from 7 to 12 is optionally present in the second component e.g. at a<br>
concentration of from 0.01% to 0.2%, based on the dressing, to maintain die pH.<br>
Appropriate amounts of nitrite, reducing agent and source of protons buffer to achieve the<br>
required rate of nitric oxide production and the required pH profile can be readily determined<br>
by experiment.<br>
The source of protons can originate from a relatively small concentration of a strong acid<br>
providing a pH in the first component of from 2.0 to 3.5. For example, hydrochloric acid<br>
can be incorporated in die first component used at concentrations between 0.5 mM to 10<br>
mM.<br>
One disadvantage of using a strong acid as source of protons is the relatively low pH of the<br>
component in which such strong acid is contained (for example, pH about 2 if 10 mM<br>
hydrochloric acid is used). Although the pH of the composition will increase to neutral<br>
values following activation, due to die buffering capacity of nitrite, the very low pH of one<br>
of the components prior to activation might still be a potential problem for some<br>
applications.<br>
Preferably therefore, the source of protons comprises a buffer with a pKa of from 4.5 to 7.0,<br>
preferably from 5 to 6, most preferably about 5.5. Such a buffer is incorporated in the first<br>
component of the dressing. As discussed above, the pH of the first component preferably<br>
has a value of from 3 to 4. At this pH a very high proportion of the buffer will be present in<br>
protonated form and can thus serve as a useful source (or reservoir) of protons.<br>
Since the buffering capacity of this buffer is minimal at pH between about 3 to 4, nitrite will<br>
be a dominant buffer in the composition following activation. As the conversion of nitrite to<br>
nitric oxide proceeds, accompanied by consumption of protons, the buffering capacity of<br>
nitrite will diminish and pH will increase. The buffering contribution of the source of<br>
protons buffer (with e.g. pKa about 5.5) will be minimal in the initial stages, but it will<br>
prevent the pH from rising too sharply above 4.5, where the conversion of nitrite to nitric<br>
oxide is rather inefficient. The pH will only reach those levels if most nitrite is converted, at<br>
which point low pH is no longer required as the build-up of nitric oxide has been achieved.<br>
Thus, there is a co-operation between nitrite (pKa 3.4) and the source of protons buffer (pKa<br>
about 5.5) in terms of proton exchange, ensuring an efficient conversion of nitrite whilst<br>
maintaining mild pH environment.<br>
The source of protons buffer can be added to the formulation in the form of an additive.<br>
Conveniently, it can be incorporated as part of a polymeric support. Preferred polymeric<br>
supports comprise polymers based on polyacrylic acid contain dissociable groups with pKa<br>
between 5 to 6.<br>
As a further possibility, protons may be generated in the dressing on activation, e.g. from an<br>
oxidase enzyme/substrate system. An oxidase enzyme catalyses reaction of an appropriate<br>
substrate with oxygen to produce hydrogen peroxide and an acid, which dissociates to<br>
produce protons. The preferred oxidasc/substratc system is glucose oxidase and glucose.<br>
Glucose oxidase catalyses oxidation of glucose by oxygen to produce hydrogen peroxide and<br>
gluconic acid. Gluconic acid dissociates to produce gluconate anion and a proton and can<br>
thus serve as the source of protons:<br>
<br>
The enzyme and corresponding substrate are conveniently incorporated in separate dressing<br>
components (which may correspond to or be different from the first and second components<br>
discussed above) so they are not in contact prior to activation of the dressing. However, on<br>
activation of the dressing, the enzyme and substrate are brought into communication<br>
permitting contact, resulting in generation of protons.<br>
Non-thiol reducing agents that are not acids with pK* between about 1 to 4 are preferably<br>
used as the reductant of the present invention. The reductant may be present in the first<br>
component, the second component and/or in a third component. Examples of suitable<br>
reducing agents include iodide anion, butylated hydroquinone, tocopherol, butylated<br>
hydroxyanisole, butylated hydroxytoluene and beta-carotene.<br>
The reductant is typically present in concentrations 0.1% to 5% (w/w) based on the dressing.<br>
Each dressing component conveniently comprises a carrier or support, either in the form of a<br>
monomeric matrix or in the form of a polymeric matrix. Each dressing component can be in<br>
the form of liquid, amorphous gel or in the form of a layer, e.g. in the form of a sheet, slab or<br>
dry film.<br>
As discussed above, particularly convenient support is a polymer based on polyacrylic acid<br>
which contains dissociable groups with pKa between 5 to 6.<br>
The carrier or support conveniently comprises a hydrated hydrogel. A hydrated hydrogel<br>
means one or more water-based or aqueous gels, in hydrated form A hydrated hydrogel can<br>
also act to absorb water and other materials exuded from a wound site, enabling the dressing<br>
to perform a valuable and useful function by removing such materials from a wound site.<br>
The hydrated hydrogel also provides a source of moisture, that can act in use to maintain a<br>
wound site moist, aiding healing.<br>
Suitable hydrated hydrogels are disclosed in WO 03/090800. The hydrated hydrogel<br>
conveniently comprises hydrophilic polymer material. Suitable hydrophilic polymer<br>
materials include polyacrylates and methacrylates, e.g. as supplied by First Water Ltd in the<br>
form of proprietary hydrogels, including poly 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulphonic acid<br>
(poly-AMPS) and/or salts thereof (e.g. as described in WO 01/96422), polysaccharides e.g.<br>
polysaccharide gums particularly xanthan gum (e.g. available under the Trade Mark Keltrol),<br>
various sugars, polycarboxylic acids (e.g. available under the Trade Mark Gantrez AN-169<br>
BF from ISP Europe), poly(methyl vinyl ether co-maleic anhydride) (e.g. available under the<br>
Trade Mark Gantrez AN 139, having a molecular weight in the range 20,000 to 40,000),<br>
polyvinyl pyrrolidone (e.g. in the form of commercially available grades known as PVP K-<br>
30 and PVP K-90), polyethylene oxide (e.g. available under the Trade Mark Polyox WSR-<br>
301), polyvinyl alcohol (e.g. available under the Trade Mark Elvanol), cross-linked<br>
polyacrylic polymer (e.g. available under the Trade Mark Carbopol EZ-1), celluloses and<br>
modified celluloses including hydroxypropyl cellulose (e.g. available under the Trade Mark<br>
Klucel EEF), sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (e.g. available under the Trade Mark<br>
Cellulose Gum 7LF) and hydroxyethyl cellulose (e.g. available under the Trade Mark<br>
Natrosol 250 LR).<br>
Mixtures of hydrophilic polymer materials may be used in a gel.<br>
In a hydrated hydrogel of hydrophilic polymer material, the hydrophilic polymer material is<br>
desirably present at a concentration of at least 1%, preferably at least 2%, more preferably at<br>
least 5%, yet more preferably at least 10%, or at least 20%, desirably at least 25% and even<br>
more desirably at least 30% by weight based on die total weight of the gel. Even higher<br>
amounts, up to about 40% by weight based on the total weight of the gel, may be used.<br>
Good results have been obtained with use of a hydrated hydrogel of poly-AMPS and/or salts<br>
thereof in an amount of about 30% by weight of the total weight of the gel.<br>
By using a gel comprising a relatively high concentration (at least 2% by weight) of<br>
hydrophilic polymer material, the gel can function particularly effectively to take up water in<br>
use of the dressing, e.g. from serum exudates while in contact with a wound. Because the<br>
gel is an aqueous system, use of the dressing does not have the effect of inducing an overall<br>
dryness of the wound which would be undesirable. This is because water vapour pressure is<br>
maintained in the enclosed environment surrounding the skin in use of the dressing. The gel<br>
thus functions as an absorbent entity for the removal of moisture, e.g. wound exudate, that<br>
also provides a helpful background level of excess moisture.<br>
The water-uptake capacity of a hydrated hydrogel, including a high concentration gel,<br>
enables the dressing to aid wound healing by removing substantial amounts of exudates,<br>
swelling-up as it does so. By using a carefully formulated, ready-hydrated gel, the wound is<br>
prevented from reaching a state of unhelpful dryness. Ready hydration also ensures the<br>
quick formation of an aqueous liquid interface between the dressing and the wound, thus<br>
preventing adhesion, which otherwise would interfere with easy lifting of the dressing when<br>
it has to be replaced. A good aqueous liquid interface between the wound and the dressing is<br>
also important in allowing any beneficial products carried in the gel to enter the wound<br>
through all of the available surface.<br>
The hydrated hydrogel material is typically in the form of a solid layer, sheet or film of<br>
material that is typically cross-linked, and that may incorporate a mechanical reinforcing<br>
structure. The size and shape of the layer, sheet or film can be selected to suit the intended<br>
use of the dressing. Thicknesses in the range 0.05 to 5 mm, preferably 0.5 to 3 mm are<br>
particularly suitable.<br>
Alternatively, the hydrated hydrogel may be in the form of an amorphous gel not having a<br>
fixed form or shape, that can be deformed and shaped in three dimensions, including being<br>
squeezed through a nozzle. Amorphous gels are typically not cross-linked or have low<br>
levels of cross-linking. A shear-thinning amorphous gel may be used. Such a gel is liquid<br>
when subjected to shear stress (e.g. when being poured or squeezed through a nozzle) but set<br>
when static. Thus the gel may be in the form of a pourable or squeezable component that<br>
may be dispensed, e.g. from a compressible tube or a syringe-like dispenser, comprising a<br>
piston and cylinder, typically with a nozzle of about 3 mm diameter. Such a gel may be<br>
applied in the form of a surface layer, or into a wound cavity as a fully conformable gel that<br>
fills the available space and contacts the wound surface.<br>
A typical example of an amorphous gel formulation is: 15% w/w AMPS (sodium salt),<br>
0.19% polyethylene glycol diacrylate and 0.01% hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone, with the<br>
volume made up to 100% with analytical grade DI water. The reagents are thoroughly<br>
mixed and dissolved, then polymerised for between 30-60 seconds, using a.UV-A lamp<br>
delivering approximately 100 mW/cm2, to form the required hydrogel. This may be<br>
contained in plastic syringes from which the amorphous gel may then be dispensed from a<br>
syringe to a target site, as a surface layer or to fill a cavity.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the dressing comprises two components which are amorphous.<br>
The components can be in the form of e.g. a gel, semi-solid, cream, lotion or liquid e.g. an<br>
aqueous solution. Hydrated hydrogels may be conveniently employed, as discussed above.<br>
The two amorphous components are kept separate until it is desired to apply the dressing to a<br>
body surface. Conveniently they are packaged in a container having a nozzle, through which<br>
the amorphous components can be delivered. Preferably, the two components are packaged<br>
in a two compartment dispenser, preferably being operable to deliver both components<br>
simultaneously.<br>
The dressing optionally includes, or is used with, a covering or outer layer for adhering the<br>
dressing to the skin of a human or animal in known manner.<br>
Dressings in accordance with the invention can be manufactured in a range of different sizes<br>
and shapes to enable efficient application onto an area of body.<br>
Dressing components arc suitably stored prior to use in sterile, scaled, watcr-impcrvious<br>
packages, e.g. dual-chamber plastic tubes or laminated aluminium foil packages.<br>
In use, the dressing component or components are removed from their packaging and e.g. are<br>
mixed appropriately on the skin of a human or animal, e.g. over a region of skin to be treated<br>
for cosmetic or therapeutic purposes. The dressing may be activated prior to or during<br>
application onto skin. The dressing may also be used as an adjuvant for transdermal delivery.<br>
The invention will be further described, by way of illustration, in the following Examples,<br>
and with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>

Measurement of S-nitrosothiol concentration in aqueous solutions<br>
The following reagents were prepared:<br>
Reagent 1: Na-phosphate buffer (pH 7.4,0.1 M)<br>
Reagent 2: Griess reagent: 20 mg of N-(1-Naphthyl)ethylendiamine dihydrochloride<br>
(NADD) + 500 mg of sulphanilamide dissolved in 2 mL of DMSO. (N.B. This solution is<br>
light sensitive and should be kept in the dark as much as possible)<br>
Reagent 3: Mercuric chloride (10 mM) in DMSO (13.58 mg of HgCl2 in 5 mL of<br>
DMSO)<br>
The six-step procedure set out below was then followed:<br>
Dispense 1.5 mL of Reagent 1 into a plastic cuvette<br>
Add 200 uL of the sample (i.e. sample in which GSNO concentration is to be determined)<br>
Add 1.17 mL of Dl water<br>
Add 100 uL of Reagent 2<br>
Add 30 uL of Reagent 3 and give the solution a good mix<br>
Read absorbance of the resulting mixture at 496 nm in 10 min.<br>
The concentration of nitrosothiol concentration can be estimateded from the absorbance<br>
reading using the molar absorption coefficient for nitrosothiols = approximately 10,000 M"1<br>
cm"1.<br>
Example 1: Changes of pH resulting from generation of nitric oxide in a mixture<br>
containing hydroquinone and an unbuffered acidified solution of sodium nitrite<br>
pH was measured in a solution of acidified nitrite both in the absence and in the presence of<br>
hydroquinone (i.e. a model non-thiol reducing compound). Nitrite was acidified by addition<br>
of hydrochloric acid to achieve final concentration 10 mM (Fig. 1) or 4 mM (Fig. 2). If 10<br>
mM hydrochloric acid was used to acidify the reaction mixture pH was maintained at<br>
approximately 3.8 in the absence of the reducing agent. In contrast, the presence of<br>
hydroquinone resulted in a rapid increase of pH to about 5.0 followed by a further slow<br>
increase. A similar pH profile was observed if 4 mM hydrochloric acid was used to acidify<br>
the mixture (Fig. 2), except that in this case the initial pH was higher (about 4.2). In both<br>
cases the increase of pH was accompanied by formation of gas bubbles in the mixtures,<br>
reflecting the formation of nitric oxide in the mixtures. No bubble formation was observed in<br>
the absence of the reducing agent.<br>
The example demonstrates the ability of the nitric oxide generating system to regulate its pH<br>
in the absence of buffers with pK« between about 1 to 4. The actual rate of the nitric oxide<br>
generation can be regulated by the degree of acidification of the system.<br>
Claims<br>
1. A skin dressing comprising a first component comprising a source of protons,<br>
a second component comprising a nitrite salt, the dressing comprising a non-thiol<br>
reductant, such that, when the first and second components are brought together and<br>
applied to a skin site the nitrite reacts to generate nitric oxide, increasing the pH of the<br>
dressing in contact with the skin from an acidic value to a more neutral value.<br>
2. A skin dressing according to claim 1, wherein the pH of the first component is<br>
from 2.0 to 5.0.<br>
3. A skin dressing according to claim 1 or claim 2, which is free of any<br>
additional materials having a pK* of from 1.0 to 4.0.<br>
4. A skin dressing according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the<br>
source of protons comprises a buffer with a pK* of from 4.5 to 7.0.<br>
5. A skin dressing according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein, as the<br>
nitrite reacts to generate nitric oxide or a nitric oxide donor, the pH of the dressing in<br>
contact with the skin increases from below 5.0 to above 5.0.<br>
6. A skin dressing according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the pH<br>
of the second component is from 5.0 to 12.0.<br>
7. A skin dressing according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the first<br>
and second components are amorphous.<br>
8. A skin dressing according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the first<br>
component and/or the second component comprise a polymeric support.<br>
9. A skin dressing according to claim 8, wherein the fflst component comprises a<br>
polymeric support based on polyacrylic acid.<br>
<br>
<br>
A skin dressing is provided comprising a first component comprising a source of protons, a second component<br>
comprising a nitrite salt, the dressing comprising a non- thiol reductant, such that, when the first and second components are brought<br>
together and applied to a skin site the nitrite reacts to generate nitric oxide, increasing the pH of the dressing in contact with the skin<br>
from an acidic value to a more neutral value.</td>
