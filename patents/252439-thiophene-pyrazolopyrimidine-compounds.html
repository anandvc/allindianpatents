FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
This invention relates to novel thiophene pyrazolopyrimidine compounds, pharmaceutical compositions thereof, and use thereof as CRFl receptor antagonists in the treatment of psychiatric and neuroendocrine disorders, neurological diseases, and metabolic syndrome.<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) is a 41 amino acid peptide that is the primary physiological regulator of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) derived peptide secretion from the anterior pituitary gland. In addition to its endocrine role at the pituitary gland, immunohistochemical localization of CRF has demonstrated that the hormone has a broad extrahypothalamic distribution in the central nervous system and produces a wide spectrum of autonomic, electrophysiological and behavioral effects consistent with a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator role in the brain. There is also evidence that CRF plays a significant role in integrating the response in the immune system to physiological, psychological, and immunological stressors.<br><br>
CRF has been implicated in psychiatric disorders and neurological diseases including depression and anxiety, as well as the following conditions: Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, migraine, alcohol and substance abuse and associated withdrawal symptoms, obesity, metabolic syndrome, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, Cushing's disease, hypertension, stroke, irritable bowel syndrome, stress- induced gastric ulceration, premenstrual syndrome, sexual dysfunction, premature labor, inflammatory disorders, allergies, multiple sclerosis, visceral pain, sleep disorders, pituitary tumors or ectopic pituitary-derived tumors, chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia.<br><br>
CRF receptor subtypes, CRFl and CRF2, have been identified and are distributed heterogeneously within the brain thereby suggesting potential functional diversity. For example, widely distributed brain CRFl receptors are strongly implicated in emotionality <br><br>
accompanying exposure to environmental stressors. Significantly, CRFl, not CRF2, receptors appear to mediate select anxiogenic like behaviors. A more discrete septal/hypothalmic distribution and the availability of alternative endogenous ligands suggest a different functional role for the CRF2 receptor. For example, a novel CRF- family neuropeptide with preferential affinity for CRF2 relative to CRFl receptors is reported to suppress appetite without producing the profile of behavioral activation observed with selective CRFl agonism. In other cases, CRF2 agonism produces similar effects to those reported for CRFl antagonists or CRFl gene deletion. For example, while CRF2 agonists have been proposed as antiobesity agents, CRF 1 antagonists may be an important treatment for obesity as well.<br><br>
Certain pyrrolo[2,3-<i pyrrolo pyrazolo a l and useful as crf antagonists are described in wo the present invention provides novel thiophene pyrazolopyrimidines></i>
<br>
CRFl receptor antagonists. In view of the above, it is desirable to discover new efficacious and selective antagonists of CRFl as potentially valuable therapeutic agents for the treatment of psychiatric and neuroendocrine disorders, neurological diseases, and metabolic syndrome. Further, since a majority of commercial CNS and cardiovascular drugs exhibit undesirable bioavailability profiles, it is also desirable to discover new compounds with superior bioavailability profiles relative to known CRF antagonists such as CP154526 and NBI30775.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In one embodiment, the present invention relates to a compound of Formula I<br><br><br>
Formula I wherein: <br><br>
R1 and R2 are independently hydrogen or Ci-C3alkyl;<br><br><br>
R4 is Cl or methyl;<br><br>
R5 is hydrogen, Br, nitro, methoxy, methoxymethyl, dimethylamino,<br><br>
ethoxycarbonyl, acetamido, acetoxy, ; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.<br><br>
In another embodiment, the present invention relates to a method of treating depression or major depressive disorder, anxiety, alcohol or substance abuse, obesity, hypertension, metablic syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, epilepsy, stroke, sleep disorders, allergy, migraine, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), infertility, sexual dysfunction, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, Cushing's disease, premature labor, stress- induced gastric ulceration, inflammatory disorders, pituitary or ectopic pituitary-derived tumors, chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, visceral pain or multiple sclerosis in a patient, comprising: administering to a patient in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br><br>
In another embodiment, the present invention relates to use of a compound of Formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of depression or major depressive disorder, anxiety, alcohol or substance abuse, obesity, hypertension, metablic syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, epilepsy, stroke, sleep disorders, allergy, migraine, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), infertility, sexual dysfunction, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, Cushing's disease, premature labor, stress-induced gastric ulceration, inflammatory disorders, pituitary or ectopic pituitary-derived tumors, chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, visceral pain or multiple sclerosis.<br><br>
In another embodiment, the present invention relates to a compound of Formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for use as a pharmaceutical. <br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
As used above, and throughout the description of the invention, the following terms, unless otherwise indicated, shall be understood to have the following meanings: "Alkyl" means a saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon group, which may be straight or branched, having 1 to 5 carbon atoms in the chain.<br><br>
"Pharmaceutically acceptable excipient" refers to a pharmaceutically acceptable formulation carrier, solution, or additive to enhance the formulation characteristics. Such excipients must be compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof and are well known to the skilled artisan (see e.g. Remingtons Pharmaceutical Sciences, 19th Edition, Mack Publishing Company, 1995). "Pharmaceutically acceptable salts" refers to the relatively non-toxic, inorganic and organic acid addition salts, and base addition salts, of compounds of the present invention. These salts can be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of the compounds. In particular, acid addition salts can be prepared by separately reacting the purified compound in its free base form with a suitable organic or inorganic acid and isolating the salt thus formed (see e.g. Remingtons Pharmaceutical Sciences , 19th Edition, Mack Publishing Company, 1995).<br><br>
"Therapeutically effective amount" or "effective amount" means the amount of the compound of formula I of the present invention or pharmaceutical composition containing a compound of formula I of the present invention that will elicit the biological or medical response of or desired therapeutic effect on a tissue, system, animal or human that is being sought by the researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician.<br><br>
The terms "treatment," "treat," "treating," and the like, are meant to include both slowing and reversing the progression of a disorder. These terms also include alleviating, ameliorating, attenuating, eliminating, or reducing one or more symptoms of a disorder or condition, even if the disorder or condition is not actually eliminated and even if progression of the disorder or condition is not itself slowed or reversed. The term "treatment" and like terms also include preventive (e.g., prophylactic) and palliative treatment. Prevention of the disease is manifested by a prolonging or delaying of the onset of the symptoms of the disease. <br><br>
The symbol " " in a molecular structure indicates the position of attachment for that particular substituent.<br><br>
When any variable occurs more than one time in any constituent or in formula I, its definition on each occurrence is independent of its definition at every other occurrence. Also, combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds. In choosing compounds of the present invention, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the various substituents, i.e. R 1, R2, etc., are to be chosen in conformity with well- known principles of chemical structure connectivity. Under standard nomenclature used throughout this disclosure, the terminal portion of the designated side chain is described first, followed by the adjacent functionality toward the point of attachment. For example, an arylcarbonylaminoalkyl substituent is equivalent to aryl-C(O)-NH-alkyl-.<br><br>
The present invention contemplates specific classes of inventions, such as the following:<br><br>
(a) A compound of Formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein R1 and R2 are independently ethyl or w-propyl;<br><br>
(b) A compound of Formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof,<br><br>
wherein (c) A compound of Formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof,<br><br>
CH<br><br>
N wherein R5 is methoxy, methoxymethyl, dimethylamino or M N J<br><br>
(d) Use of a compound of Formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for treating depression or anxiety;<br><br>
(e) Use of a compound of Formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for treating alcohol or substance abuse;<br><br>
(f) A compound of Formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, exhibiting a Ki value for CRFl binding of = 500 nM; <br><br>
(g) A compound of Formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, exhibiting a Ki value for CRFl binding of = 50 nM; (h) A compound of Formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, exhibiting a Ki value for CRFl binding of = 5 nM; (i) A compound of Formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, exhibiting a Ki value for CRFl binding of = 500 nM and selectively binding to<br><br>
CRFl (i.e., lower Ki) relative to CRF2; (j) A compound of Formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, exhibiting a Ki value for CRFl binding of = 50 nM and selectively binding to CRF 1 (i.e., lower Ki) relative to CRF2; and<br><br>
(k) A compound of Formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, exhibiting a Ki value for CRFl binding of = 5 nM and selectively binding to<br><br>
CRFl (i.e., lower Ki) relative to CRF2;<br><br>
(1) A compound of Formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, with a superior bioavailability profile relative to known CRF antagonists ( e.g.,<br><br>
CP 154526 and NBI30775).<br><br>
The compounds of the present invention are preferably formulated as pharmaceutical compositions administered by a variety of routes. Preferably, such compositions are for oral administration. Such pharmaceutical compositions and processes for preparing same are well known in the art (See, e.g., Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, A. Gennaro, et al, eds., 19th ed., Mack Publishing Co., 1995).<br><br>
The compounds of Formula I are generally effective over a wide dosage range. For example, dosages per day normally fall within the range of about 0.0001 to about 30 mg/kg of body weight. In some instances dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range may be more than adequate, while in other cases still larger doses may be employed without causing any harmful side effect, and therefore the above dosage range is not intended to limit the scope of the invention in any way. It will be understood that the amount of the compound actually administered will be determined by a physician, in the light of the relevant circumstances, including the condition to be treated, the chosen <br><br>
route of administration, the actual compound or compounds administered, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, and the severity of the patient's symptoms.<br><br>
The compounds of Formula I are CRF-I antagonists and, as such, are useful for treating a condition which is treatable by reducing CRF 1 receptor stimulation. Corticotropin releasing factor (CRF), a 41 amino acid peptide that is the primary physiological regulator of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) derived peptide secretion from the anterior pituitary gland [J. Rivier et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sd (USA) 80:4851 (1983); W. Vale et al., Science 213: 1394 (1981)], has been linked to a number of medical conditions. For example, in addition to its endocrine role at the pituitary gland, immunohistochemical localization of CRF has demonstrated that the hormone has a broad extrahypothalamic distribution in the central nervous system and produces a wide spectrum of autonomic, electrophysiological and behavioral effects consistent with a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator role in the brain [W. Vale et al., Rec. Prog. Horm. Res. 39:245 (1983); G. F. Koob, Persp. Behav. Med. 2:39 (1985); E. B. De Souza et al., J. Neurosci. 5:3189 (1985) ]. There is also evidence that CRF plays a significant role in integrating the response in the immune system to physiological, psychological, and immunological stressors [see, e.g., J. E. Blalock, Physiological Reviews 69: 1 (1989); J. E. Morley, Life Sd. 41:527 (1987)].<br><br>
CRF is involved in psychiatric disorders and neurological diseases including depression and anxiety [D. M. Nielsen, Life ScL 78:909-919; H. E. Kunzel et al., J.<br><br>
Psychiatr. Res. 37:525-533; D. R. Gehlert et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol. 509: 145-153]. A role for CRF has also been postulated in the etiology and pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, as they relate to the dysfunction of CRF neurons in the central nervous system [for a review, see: E. B. De Souze, Hosp. Practice 23:59 (1988)]. Chronic administration of CRF has been shown to produce impairment of the dopamine system suggesting a role in Parkinson's disease [E. Izzo et al., Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 81:701-708 (2005)]. Other neurological disorders in which CRF is involved include epilepsy [T. Z. Baram et al., Brain Res. 770:89-95 (1997)] and migraine [T. C. Theoharides et al., Endocrinology 136:5745-5750 (1995)]. CRF has been implicated in alcohol and substance abuse and associated withdrawal symptoms [D. H. Overstreet et al., Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 77:405-413; Y. Shaham et al., Psychopharmacology (Bed) 137: 184-190]. Moreover, <br><br>
there is evidence that CRF has a role in various endocrine disorders and cardiovascular diseases such as obesity [E. Timofeeva and D. Richard, Neuroendocrinology 66:327-340 (1997)], metabolic syndrome [A. M. Ward et al., Metabolism 53:720-726(2004)], congenital adrenal hyperplasia [D. P. Merke and G. B. Cutler Jr., Endocrinol. Metab. Clin. North Am. 30: 121-135 (2001)], Cushing's disease [M. Labeur et al., Curr. Drug Targets Immune Endocr. Metabol. Disord. 4:335-342 (2004)], hypertension [R. J. Briscoe, et al., Brain Res. 881 :204-207 (2000)], and stroke [S. L. Stevens et al., J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 23: 1151-1159 (2003)]. Gastric disturbances such as irritable bowel syndrome [Y. Tache et al., Eur J. Surg. Suppl: 16-22 (2002)] and stress-induced gastric ulceration [K. E. Gabry et al., MoI. Psychiatry 7:474-483, 433 (2002)] have been shown to be related to CRF. In addition, there is indication that CRF has a role in various areas of human female health, for example, premenstrual syndrome [F. Facchinetti et al., Psychosom. Med. 56:418-422 (1994)], infertility [L. Ghizzoni et al., Endocrinology 138:4806-4811 (1997)], sexual dysfunction [ J. E. Jones et al., Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 283:R591-597 (2002)], and premature labor [P. D. Wadhwa et al., Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 191: 1063-1069 (2004)]. There is also evidence that CRF has a significant role in the immune system indicating therapeutic potential for treating inflammatory disorders [A. Gravanis and A. N. Margioris, Curr. Med. Chem. 12:1503- 1512 (2005)], allergies [L. K. Singh et. al., Brain Behav. Immun. 13:225-239 (1999)], multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune disorders [C. Benou et al., J. Immunol. 174:5407-5413 (2005)]. In addition to the preceding, CRF has been implicated in visceral pain [M. Nijsen et al., Neurogastroenterol. Motil. 17:423-432 (2005)], sleep disorders [T. M. Buckley and A. F. Schatzberg, J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 90:3106- 3114(2005)], pituitary tumors or ectopic pituitary-derived tumors [K. D. Dieterich et al., J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 83:3327-3331 (1998)], chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia [G. Neeck and L. J. Crofford, Rheum. Dis. Clin. North Am. 26:989-1002 (2000)].<br><br>
CRF receptor subtypes, CRFl and CRF2, have been identified and are distributed heterogeneously within the brain [D. T. Chalmers et al., TIPS 17: 166-72 (1996)] thereby suggesting potential functional diversity [S. C. Heinrichs et al., Regul. Peptides 71: 15<br><br>
(1997)]. For example, widely distributed brain CRFl receptors are strongly implicated in emotionality accompanying exposure to environmental stressors [G. Liebsch et al., Regul. <br><br>
Peptides 59: 229-39 (1995); D. W. Schulz, PNAS 93: 10477-82 (1996)]. Significantly, CRFl, not CRF2, receptors appear to mediate select anxiogenic like behaviors [Heinrichs et al, 1997]. A more discrete septal/hypothalmic distribution [D. T. Chalmers et al, J. Neurosci. 15(10): 6340-50 (1995)] and the availability of alternative endogenous ligands [J. Vaughan et al., Nature 378: 287-92 (1995)] suggest a different functional role for the CRF2 receptor [Heinrichs et al., 1997]. For example, a novel CRF-family neuropeptide with preferential affinity for CRF2 relative to CRF 1 receptors is reported to suppress appetite without producing the profile of behavioral activation observed with selective CRFl agonism (H. Tezval et al., PNAS 101(25): 9468-9473 (2004)]. In some cases, CRF2 agonism produces similar effects to those reported for CRFl antagonists or CRFl gene deletion [S. C. Heinrichs, Trends in Pharmacological Sciences 20(8):311-5 (1999)]. For example, while CRF2 agonists have been proposed as antiobesity agents, CRFl antagonists may be an important treatment for obesity as well [C. Contoreggi et al., Neuroendocrinology 80(2): 111-23 (2004)].<br><br>
PREPARING COMPOUNDS OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
All of the compounds of the present invention can be chemically prepared, for example, by following the synthetic routes set forth in the Schemes below. However, the following discussion is not intended to be limiting to the scope of the present invention in any way. For example, the specific synthetic steps for each of the routes described may be combined in different ways, or in conjunction with steps from different schemes, to prepare additional compounds of Formula (I). The products of each step can be recovered by conventional methods including extraction, evaporation, precipitation, chromatography, filtration, trituration, crystallization, and the like. In the Schemes below all substituents, unless otherwise indicated, are as previously defined and suitable reagents are well known and appreciated in the art. <br><br><br>
Formation of a compound of formula (I) can be carried out in accordance with reactions as depicted in Scheme 1. An appropriate compound of formula (I) is one in which R1, R2, R3, R4, and R5 are as defined for Formula I.<br><br>
In Step 1, ethyl acetoacetate and 5-methyl-2H-pyrazol-3-ylamine are condensed to form 2,5-dimethyl-4H-pyrazolo[l,5-a]pyrimidine-7-one (1) in refluxing acetic acid.<br><br>
The pyrazolo[l,5-a]pyrimidine-7-one of formula (1) is subsequently converted to 7-chloro-2,5-dimethyl- pyrazolo[l,5-a]pyrimidine in Step 2 using phosphorous oxychloride and dimethylaniline in an inert solvent, such as toluene, at the reflux temperature of the solvent. In Scheme 1, Step 3, a Grignard reagent of formula (3) (X =C1 or Br) is reacted with the chloride of formula (2), in an inert solvent such as toluene, at reflux temperature to provide the 7-alkyl pyrazolopyrimidine of formula (4). Alternatively the 7 -alky 1 pyrazolopyrimidine of formula (4) is obtained by condensation of a diketone with 5- methyl-2H-pyrazol-3-ylamine as shown in Step 4. The reaction is performed in ethanol <br><br>
with a catalytic amount of piperidine at a temperature of 60 to 80 0C (Novinson, T., et. al. J. Med. Chem. 1975, 18, 460). When R1 = H a mixture of regioisomers are obtained, for example when R2 = propyl, which are separated after the iodination of Step 5.<br><br>
The pyrazolopyrimidine of formula (4) is functionalized to an iodo pyrazolopyrimidine of formula (5) in Step 5 using an excess of N-iodosuccinimide in acetonitrile.<br><br>
In Scheme 1, Step 6, the iodo pyrazolopyrimidine of formula (5) is reacted with a heterocyclic zinc halide (R3ZnX) (X = Cl or Br) in a Negishi cross-coupling reaction. The heterocyclic zinc halide can be generated using methods well known to those skilled in the art. For example, the organozinc reagent is generated by reacting the heterocyclic bromide with zinc metal or, alternatively, using the non-halogenated heterocycle to form the heterocyclic lithium reagent with «-, sec-, or tert-bvXyl lithium, followed by lithium- zinc exchange with ZnC^. The organozinc reagent is coupled with the iodo pyrazolopyrimidine of formula (5) in the presence of a palladium catalyst, for example, dichloro[ 1,1 ' -bis(diphenyl-phosphino)ferrocene]palladium (II) dichloromethane, in an inert solvent, such as THF, at reflux temperature for about 12 to 36 hours to provide a pyrazolopyrimidine of formula (I).<br><br>
Alternatively, in Step 7, a heterocyclic boronic acid (R3B(OH)2) is used in a Suzuki coupling reaction with the iodo compound of formula (5). There are numerous reaction conditions available to the skilled artisan for this coupling procedure. The preferred conditions use a solvent mixture of toluene/ethanol/2 M sodium carbonate with a palladium catalyst, for example, bis(tri-t-butylphosphine)palladium(0), at 60 0C to reflux temperature, for about 12 to 36 hours.<br><br>
As will be readily appreciated, heteroaryl boronic acids can be prepared by methods similar to those described herein using procedures that are well-known in the art. For example, thiophenes and benzothiophenes can be brominated using N- bromosuccinimide and subsequently converted to the boronic acid using halogen metal exchange with an alkyl lithium reagent followed by treatment with trimethylborate and hydrolysis upon workup. It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that a thienopyridine, for example, as in a compound of formula (Ic), is readily obtained by conversion of the commercially available thieno[3,2-b]pyridin-7-ol to the bromide followed by halogen metal exchange <br><br>
and quenching with a proton source such as methanol/water. Subsequent bromination with bromine at the 3 -position followed by Suzuki coupling with methylboronic acid provides 3-methyl-thieno[3,2-b]pyridine which is coupled with an iodo pyrazolopyrimidine of formula (5) using ZnCl2 as described above.<br><br>
Scheme 2<br><br><br>
Formation of a compound of formula (7), (8), or (9) can be carried out in accordance with reactions as depicted in Scheme 2. An appropriate compound of formula (7), (8), or (9) is one in which R1, R2, and R4 are as defined for formula I and "Het" is defined as shown.<br><br>
In Scheme 2, Step 1, a thiophene of formula (6) is brominated with N- bromosuccinimide in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane or chloroform. In Step 2, a bromothiophene of formula (7) is coupled with a heterocyclic zinc reagent to provide a thiophene heterocycle of formula (8). The heterocyclic zinc reagent is formed from the bromoheterocycle and zinc metal, and reacted in situ with a bromothiophene of formula (7). The reaction is performed in an inert solvent, such as THF, at the reflux temperature of the solvent. Alternatively, a heterocyclic lithium reagent can be formed for example, using «-, sec-, or tert-bvAyl lithium with 1 -methyl- <br><br>
1,2,4-triazole followed by lithium-zinc exchange with ZnCl2 to obtain the heterocyclic zinc reagent.<br><br>
In Scheme 2, Step 3, a thiophene of formula (6) is nitrated to give a nitrothiophene of formula (9). Preferred conditions use a solvent mixture of dichloromethane and TFA with 70% nitric acid. It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that the nitrothiophene of formula (9) can serve as an intermediate for further functionalization. For example, the nitro group can be reduced and acylated to give the acetamide or alkylated to give the dialkylamine.<br><br>
Also, it is recognized that the steps required to prepare a compound of formula (8) can be carried out in any order, such that the 2-heterocycle thiophene can be prepared using methods known in the art, and then functionalized as a bromothiophene or thiophenyl boronic acid and then coupled with an iodo pyrazolopyrimidine of formula (5).<br><br>
Scheme 3<br><br><br>
Formation of a compound of formula (10) can be carried out in accordance with reactions as depicted in Scheme 3. An appropriate compound of formula (10) is one in which R1, R2, and R4 are as defined for formula I and R5a = -OCH3, -OC(O)CH3, - CH2OCH3, Or -CO2CH2CH3.<br><br>
As will be readily appreciated a bromothiophene of formula (7) represents a useful intermediate which can be easily transformed into a variety of substituted thiophenes by the skilled artisan. For example, formation of the thienyl Grignard reagent followed by treatment with oxygen (Hurd, C. D. and Kreuz, K. JACS 1950, 72, 5543) provides a 2- hydroxy thiophene which is acylated to provide the acetoxy derivative. Said Grignard reagent can also be treated with an electrophile, such as ethylcyanoformate to provide an ethoxycarbonyl substituted thiophene. Halogen-lithium exchange with «-, sec-, or tert- butyl lithium can provide a thienyl lithium reagent, which can be subsequently reacted <br><br>
with electrophiles, such as alkylhalides, like iodomethyl methylether. In addition treatment with copper oxide, sodium iodide, and sodium methoxide provides a 2-methoxy thiophene.<br><br>

Example B CRFl Filter Binding Assay<br><br>
The limitations of plasmid-based human CRFl expression, in terms of generating a recombinant cell line with sufficient receptor density to develop a binding assay, are overcome by using a Phoenix retroviral expression system licensed from Stanford. The stable HEK-hCRFl cell line is used to prepare membranes and binding reactions (200 µl) are set up as follows: 50 µl of 125I-sauvagine (0.2 nM final), 50 µl compound and 100 µl CRF 1 membrane (25 µg/reaction). The reactions are incubated at room temperature for 2 hours and then terminated by filtration through pre-treated FB Millipore glass fiber filter plates (96 well). The plates are wash twice with ice-cold assay buffer (50 mM tris, 12.5 mM NaCl, ImM EDTA, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.05% BSA, pH 7.2), air dried over night and counted with 100 µl Microscint 40 in a MicroBeta counter. Non-specific binding (NSB) is determined in the presence of 0.5 µM non-labeled sauvagine. Triplicate determinations are typically run and the median data points plotted by Graph Pad Prism.<br><br>

The plates are washed twice with ice-cold <br><br>
assay buffer (50 mM tris, 12.5 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.05% BSA, pH 7.2), air dried over night and counted with 100 µl Microscint 40 in a MicroBeta counter. Non-specific binding (NSB) is determined in the presence of 0.5 µM non-labeled sauvagine. Alternatively, compounds are evaluated using a Scintillation Proximity assay. This assay is set up as follows: 50ul of 125I-Sauvagine (0.2 nM final concentration), 50 µl compound or non-labelled sauvagine (NSB) and 100 µl containing 250 µg wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) SPA beads and CRF2 membrane (1.5 µg/reaction). Plates are incubated for 4-5 hours at room temperature and then centrifuged at 200 X g for 10 minutes. Bound radioactivity is assessed using a Wallac Trilux scintillation counter. Binding is assessed typically using triplicate determinations and the median data points plotted by Graph Pad Prism. Compounds are initially screened at a fixed concentration and, if sufficient activity is noted, subsequent concentration-response curves are generated.<br><br>
Compounds of the present invention preferably exhibit a weak affinity for the CRF2 receptor (relative to CRFl). For example, Example 20 exhibits a 39% inhibition at a concentration of 50 µM.<br><br>
Example D<br><br>
Bioavailability and Pharmacokinetic Properties The volume of distribution (Vdist) relates the amount of the drug in the body to the concentration of the drug in the blood or plasma. The volume of distribution refers to the fluid volume that would be required to contain the total amount of the drug in the body at the same concentration as in the blood or plasma: Vdist = amount of drug in the body/ concentration of drug in blood or plasma (Goodman and Gillman's). For a 10 mg dose and a plasma concentration of 10 mg/L, the volume of distribution would be 1 liter. The volume of distribution reflects the extent to which the drug is present in the extravascular tissue. A large volume of distribution reflects the tendency of a compound to bind to the tissue components compared with plasma protein binding. In a clinical setting, Vdist can be used to determine a loading dose to achieve a steady state concentration.<br><br>
To test for volume of distribution, Male Sprague Dawley rats (N=3) are administered a single 1 mg/kg intravenous dose of compound. Multiple plasma samples <br><br>
are collected at time points from 0.08 to 24 hours post-dose. The plasma samples are analyzed by LC/MS/MS to determine the plasma concentrations. Plasma pharmacokinetic calculations are performed to determine the pharmacokinetic parameters including Vdist and plasma clearance (CIp).<br><br>
