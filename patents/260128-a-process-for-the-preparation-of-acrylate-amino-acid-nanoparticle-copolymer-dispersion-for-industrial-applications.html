				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of acrylate -amino acid copolymer in the form of aqueous dispersion. Particularly, the invention relates to a process for the preparation of acrylate -amino acid copolymer in the form of aqueous dispersion having average particle size as low as 40nm. The copolymer of the present invention is envisaged to have potential application in leather processing industry as retanning agents for imparting fiber compaction, fullness and buffing property. The copolymer also may find application in textile industry.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Reference may be made to Chern et al (Journal of Polymer Science, Part A: Polymer Chemistry, 39, 898, 2001), who employed non reactive alcohol hexanol in aqueous medium using known initiators at temperature of 70 -80 °C in presence of known surfactants to prepare nanoparticle aqueous acrylate/vinyl copolymer dispersions having particle size in the range of 35 - 50nm. The major limitation associated with the process is that this process involves non polymerizable alcohol which lacks reactivity and gets physically adsorbed on the polymeric dispersion leading to undesirable separation of polymeric particles with change in pH and on storage for a period of about 3 months.<br>
Attempts have been made by Larpent et.al. (Macromolecules, 30, 354, 1997} who substituted non polymerizable alcohol with reactive monomers like hydroxy ethyl /propyl acrylate to copolymerize vinyl monomers or a mixture of vinyl and acrylate monomers at temperature of 30 - 40 °C to form nanoparticle vinyl - acrylate polymer dispersion having particle size in the range of 12 -80nm. The major limitation associated with this process is that while the process involves hydroxyl acrylate monomers which are non ionic in nature, and the resulting dispersion lacks charge dependent reactivity characteristics. Moreover, this process is suitable for mainly vinyl monomers like styrene in combination with acrylate monomers having chain length of a maximum of C4, oil soluble acrylate monomers having alkyl chain length of more than C4 cannot be polymerized by this process.<br><br>
Reference may be made to Antonietti et al (Langmuir,10, 2498, 1994), who prepared nanoparticle polystyrene dispersion having particle size in the range of 12 -40nm using lecithin and sodium cholate in presence of known initiator at a temperature in the range of 60- 80°C. The major limitation of the process is that the process is reported only for vinyl monomer like styrene and is not applicable for acrylate monomers having much longer chain length more than C4. Furthermore, the process involves use of non polymerizable species of lecithin which gets physically adsorbed on the polymeric particles.<br>
No prior art is available on the preparation of nanoparticle polymeric dispersion having a high coverage of reactive functional sites that exhibit charge characteristics. Such a process demands choice of polymerizable comonomer consisting of reactive functional groups like -COOH group, and capable of providing unique interfacial coverage on the acrylate monomer and polymeric particle.<br>
Objects of the Invention<br>
The main object of the present investigation is to provide a process for the preparation of acrylate - amino acid nanoparticle copolymer dispersion for industrial applications, which obviates the limitations as detailed above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for making nanoparticle acrylate copolymer dispersion using polymerizable amino acid to provide coverage with reactive functional sites, exhibiting chemical binding and providing typical interfacial coverage to polymeric matrix, thus enabling extraordinary stability.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a process for making aqueous nanoparticle polymeric dispersion with particle size distribution as low as 40 nm.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of acrylate -amino acid nanoparticle copolymer dispersion for industrial applications<br><br>
which comprises copolymerizing aqueous dispersion of water insoluble acrylate monomer having C4 - Ci8 alkyl chain with 1-10 parts by weight of polymerizable amino acid, having ethylenic linkage, the amino acid being selected from acidic, basic, neutral amino acid, in the presence of surfactant, with surfactant to water insoluble acrylate ratio in the range of 0.3 - 1.0 (w/w), either thermally at a temperature in the range of 40 - 90°C using radical initiator in the range of 0.1-5% (w/w), or through irradiation by known method using 0.01-2% w/w of photo and/or free radical initiator at a temperature in the range of 25-40°C to obtain the desired acrylate -amino acid nanoparticle copolymer dispersion.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the water insoluble acrylate monomer used is selected from the group consisting of butyl acrylate, dodecyl acrylate, octadecyl acrylate, and combination there of.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the amount of water used for the preparation of aqueous solution in polymerization reaction is in the range of 70-85%w/w.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the amino acid used is selected from the group consisting of glycine, alanine, leucine, norleucine, isoleucine, and combination there of.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the ratio of acrylate monomer to amino acid used is in the range of 1:1 to 1:5.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the known surfactant used is selected from the group consisting of sodium dodecyl sulfate, cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide, and t-octyl phenyl polyethylene glycol ether.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the free radical initiator used is selected from the group consisting of potassium persulphate, azo bis iso butyro nitrile(AIBN), ascorbic acid and azo valeric acid.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the photo initiator used is selected from 2,2 dimethoxy 2-phenyl acetophenone, and azo bis iso butyro nitrile.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the source of the irradiation is selected from UV-visible and Gamma radiation.<br><br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the acrylate -amino acid nanoparticle copolymer dispersion obtained has average particle size distribution in the range of 40-90 nm.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
Water insoluble acrylate monomer having C4 -Ci8 alkyl chain is added to surfactant solution prepared by dissolving known surfactant in water, the weight of water is in range of 70-85% w/w of solution to form dispersion. Known surfactant is used in such a way that the weight ratio of surfactant to water insoluble acrylate is in the range of 0.3 - 1.0. This is treated with 1 - 2 parts by weight of polymerizable amino acid, having ethylenic linkage. The amino acid is selected from acidic, basic, neutral amino acid. The copolymerization is carried out for a duration of 3 - 10hrs either by thermal process at a temperature in the range of 25 - 90°C using 0.1 -5%w/w, of known free radical initiator or through irradiation by known method using 0.01-2% w/w of photo and/or free radical initiator on the weight of water insoluble monomer at a temperature in the range of 25-40°C to form acrylate -amino acid nanoparticle copolymer dispersion.<br>
The inventive step of the present invention lies in the selection and use of polymerizable amino acid which by virtue of typical interfacial coverage facilitates generation of nanoparticle dispersion through copolymerization reaction with long chain water insoluble acrylate.<br>
