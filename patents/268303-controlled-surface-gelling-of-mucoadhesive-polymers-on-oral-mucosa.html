				<td>TITLE OF THE INVENTION <br>
CONTROLLED SURFACE GELLFNG OF MUCOADHESIVE POLYMERS ON ORAL<br>
MUCOSA BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0001]    Xerostomia, commonly known as "dry mouth," is a condition in which the salivary glands do not produce sufficient quantities of saliva. Normally, mucous forms a continuous protective layer in the nose, mouth and throat. A patient suffering from xerostomia not only has decreased fluid in the mouth, but also an insufficient quantity of mucoproteins and mucopolysaccharides to hold fluid in contact with the cells and create a barrier to irritation and infection. This causes discomfort which can in some cases be quite severe. Without saliva, the mouth burns and the throat and tongue can undergo radical changes. Teeth can decay rapidly and the tongue can become smooth, cracked and vulnerable to infection.<br>
[0002]    Symptoms of mild xerostomia can be somewhat alleviated by the consumption of fluids, chewing gums, oral sprays, mouthwashes, hard candies and throat lozenges. Artificial saliva and salivary substitutes have also been proposed as palliative treatments for the symptoms of xerostomia, which preparations have physical and chemical properties that simulate those of natural (human) saliva. Examples of artificial salivas include compositions which contain ions that mimic those found in natural saliva, glycerin, as well as carboxymethylcellulose-based preparations to provide the proper level of viscosity. Fluoride ions are sometimes included to these preparations to prevent demineralization of tooth enamel. Nevertheless, these compositions have not found wide acceptance as many patients find that such preparations are irritating or distasteful and that their lubricating effect is of relatively short duration.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
 [0003]    The present invention relates to an oral composition and method for alleviating the symptoms associated with xerostomia using encapsulated cation-releasing compounds formulated either intimately together or in separate compartments in a composition containing cation-sensitive mucoadhesive polymers. [0004]    In one embodiment, the oral composition includes a cation-sensitive mucoadhesive polymer and a cation-releasing compound, wherein the cation-releasing compound is encapsulated in a water-insoluble, rupturable capsule.<br>
[0005]    In one embodiment, the oral composition includes a first component having a cation-sensitive mucoadhesive polymer and a second component having an encapsulated cation-releasing compound, the first and second components being maintained separate from each other until dispensed and combined for application to the oral cavity.<br>
[0006]    In one embodiment, a method for reducing dryness in an oral cavity includes the steps of delivering into the oral cavity a composition containing a mucoadhesive polymer and water-insoluble capsules containing a cation-releasing compound, releasing the cation-releasing compound from the capsules in the oral cavity, releasing " cations from the cation-releasing compound, exposing the mucoadhesive polymer to the cations, and adhering the mucoadhesive polymer to oral surfaces in the oral cavity.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0007]    Unless otherwise specified, all percentages and amounts expressed herein and elsewhere in the specification should be understood to refer to percentages by weight. Also, the term "about," when used in reference to a range of values, should be understood to modify either value in the range, or to both values in the range.<br>
 [0008]    As used throughout, ranges are used as shorthand for describing each and every value that is within the range. Any value within the range can be selected as the terminus of the range.<br>
[0009]    In addition, all references cited herein are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties. In the event of a conflict in a definition in the present disclosure and that of a cited reference, the present disclosure controls.<br>
[0010]    Monovalent cations, such as Na+, and K+ and divalent cations, such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ trigger the gelation process and/or enhance the structure of certain mucoadhesive polymer gels. Furthermore, the cations can act as ionic bridges between these cation-sensitive mucoadhesive polymers and the oral mucosa, providing stronger adhesion of the mucoadhesive polymer to the oral surfaces. By exposing these cation-sensitive mucoadhesive polymers to the cations in the oral cavity, the gelling of the mucoadhesive polymers is facilitated and their adhesion to the oral surfaces is enhanced.<br>
[0011]    Examples of compositions and methods that have been used to alleviate the symptoms associated with dry mouth are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,658,554,<br>
6,159,459, and 7,198,779, which are each incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.<br>
[0012]    The present invention overcomes the problems and disadvantages associated with current treatments for xerostomia by using sterically entrapped or encapsulated cation-releasing compounds formulated either intimately together or in a separate compartment in a low ionic strength composition containing cation-sensitive mucoadhesive polymers, that when delivered from oral vehicles such as mouthwashes, sprays and toothpastes, the shear imposed during use ruptures the encapsulation and releases the soluble cations from the cation-releasing compounds, allowing the cations to interact with the mucoadhesive polymers to increase surface adhesion. As mentioned above, the cations facilitate the gelling of the cation-sensitive mucoadhesive polymers and their interaction with the outer layers of mucin, providing a strong viscoelastic layer which acts as a lubricating moisture barrier and in turn provides a long-lived lubricating moisture barrier and protective coating that may help alleviate the symptoms of xerostomia.<br>
[0013]    In certain embodiments, a composition in accordance with the present invention includes a cation-sensitive mucoadhesive polymer and a cation-releasing compound, wherein the cation-releasing compound is encapsulated in a rupturable capsule.<br>
[0014]    Examples of mucoadhesive polymer materials that are sensitive to cation exposure include gellan gum and carrageenan. Gellan gum is a hydrocolloid produced via the fermentation process of carbohydrate by microorganisms. The molecular structure of gellan gum is a straight chain based on repeating glucose, rhamnose and glucuronic acid units. Carrageenan is a cell wall hydrocolloid found in certain species of seaweeds belonging to red algae and is composed of repeating units of galactose and 3,6-anhydrogalactose with sulfate esters in varying amount and location depending on the type of carrageenan. Any form of carrageenan may be use, including K-, L-, and/or X-. Both gellan gum and carrageenan exhibit enhanced gel structure with increased cation concentrations (0.01-1%). Other examples of cation-sensitive mucoadhesive polymers include alginates and pectin.<br>
[0015]    In one embodiment, a cation-sensitive mucoadhesive polymer for use in the present invention includes a low acyl gellan gum that is marketed by CP Kelco as<br>
Kelcogel® CG at an amount of about 0.025% to about 2.5% by weight. In another embodiment, a mucoadhesive polymer for use in the present invention is iota or kappa carrageenan or a mixture thereof at an amount of about 0.1% to about 1% by weight. [0016]    It should be noted that any polymeric materials useable in oral care preparations which exhibit gelling behavior in the presence of cations can be used in the present invention.<br>
[0017]    Cation-releasing compounds that may be used in accordance with the present invention include salts, such as calcium salts, sodium salts, and metal salts. In certain embodiments, the cation-releasing compound includes soluble divalent salts. A cation-releasing compound useable in the present invention is calcium chloride (CaCl2), which releases divalent Ca2+ cations when dissolved. Additional cation-releasing compounds that may be used in the present invention include other non-toxic soluble calcium salts such as calcium acetate, calcium butylate, calcium citrate, calcium lactate, and calcium salicylate, and non-toxic soluble magnesium salts, such as, magnesium sulfate, and magnesium chloride. Other metal salts may be suitable, such as tin salts, iron salts, copper salts, gold or silver salts, and/or titanium salts.<br>
[0018]    By encapsulating a cation-releasing compound in a capsule or shell, the cation-releasing compound can be maintained substantially separate (e.g. sequestered) from the other ingredients of the oral composition until subsequently being released when the capsules rupture during application to oral surfaces by the consumer. When delivered from an oral care vehicle, such as a mouthwash, spray or toothpaste, the mechanical and/or shear forces imposed on the composition, for example, during the spraying onto the oral surfaces or during the course of brushing, ruptures the capsules and releases the soluble cations, allowing the released cations to interact with the cation-sensitive mucoadhesive polymers to facilitate gelation and adhesion of the mucoadhesive polymers to the oral surfaces. Encapsulation of the cation-releasing compounds prevents exposure of the mucoadhesive polymers to the cations prior to use by the consumer, such as during manufacture and storage of the oral composition, which would otherwise result in premature gelation and decreased adhesion of the mucoadhesive polymer to the oral surfaces.<br>
[0019]    Encapsulation materials may be water soluble or insoluble. Materials that may be used for encapsulating the cation-releasing compounds in accordance with the<br>
present invention include silicone, gelatin, amphiphilic diblock copolymers, phospholipids, neutral block copolymers, polyethylene oxide polyethylene, poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLG A), alkyl cellulose polymers such as ethyl cellulose, and other cellulosic polymers. Other encapsulation materials that may be useful in the present invention include synthetic organic plastic materials such as phenol formaldehydes, vinyl chloride polymers, polyethylene, polypropylene, polyurethanes, ABS resins, and waxes.<br>
[0020]    Methods which may be used for encapsulating the cation-releasing compounds of the present invention are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,976,507 and 6,258,343, which are each incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. U.S. Patent No. 5,976,507 describes dentifrice compositions and methods for preparing the same wherein at least one active ingredient, such as a calcium salt, is encapsulated in a plasticized alkyl cellulose polymer shell. U.S. Patent No. 6,258,343 describes an improved method for encapsulating active dental ingredients, such as a calcium salt, in an alkyl cellulosic polymer matrix.<br>
[0021]    Other materials and methods for encapsulating ingredients in oral compositions known in the art may also be useful in the present invention. For example, U.S. Patent Nos. 3,957,964,3,929,988,4,071,614,4,220,552,4,348,378, and 4,376,762, which are each incorporated herein by reference in their entireties, describe oral compositions containing ingredients such as flavors and dyes that are encapsulated in rupturable, water-insoluble capsules.<br>
[0022]    The oral composition of the present invention containing encapsulated cation-releasing compound and mucoadhesive polymers may be administered orally in an acceptable vehicle in liquid or paste form. The oral composition of the present invention may be delivered, for example, as a mouthwash, spray, or toothpaste. <br>
[0023]    A composition in accordance with the present invention may be prepared by adding the encapsulated cation-releasing compounds and cation-sensitive mucoadhesive polymers to an aqueous vehicle (e.g., for a mouthwash or spray) or dentifrice (e.g., a toothpaste) containing one or more of the following: flavoring agents, surfactants, humectants, sweeteners, preservatives, thickeners, and polishing agents.

Pluronic 108 has a molecular weight of 3200 and contains 80% of the hydrophilic polyoxyethylene moiety and Pluronic F127 has a molecular weight of 4000 and contains 70% polyoxyethylene. The surfactants assist in achieving thorough and complete dispersion of ingredients throughout the oral cavity and render the compositions more cosmetically acceptable. Non-ionic surfactants also help maintain the flavoring agents in solution by solubilizing the flavor oils. A surfactant may be included in an amount of about 0.25% to about 3% by weight.<br>
[0026]    Examples of surfactants useful in the preparation of a dentifrice in accordance with the present invention include water-soluble salts of higher fatty acid monoglyceride monosulfates, such as the sodium salt of the monosulfated monoglyceride of hydrogenated coconut oil fatty acids, cocamidopropyl betaine, higher alkyl sulfates such as sodium lauryl sulfate, alkyl aryl sulfonates such as sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate, higher alkyl sulfoacetates, sodium lauryl sulfoacetate, higher fatty acid esters of 1,2-dihydroxy propane sulfonate, and the substantially saturated higher aliphatic acyl amides of lower aliphatic amino carboxylic acid compounds, such as those having 12 to 16 carbons in the fatty acid, alkyl or acyl radicals, and the like. Examples of the last mentioned amides are N-lauroyl sarcosine, and the sodium, potassium, and ethanolamine salts of N-lauroyl, N-myristoyl, or N-palmitoyl sarcosine.

[0037]    For example, a toothpaste composition containing a cation-sensitive mucoadhesive polymer(s) and encapsulated cation-releasing compound(s) in accordance with the present invention may be formulated as a multi-component toothpaste in separate compartments in order to further prevent premature exposure of the mucoadhesive polymer to the cations during storage. In this embodiment, the oral composition may be packaged in a suitable dispensing container in which the mucoadhesive polymer and the encapsulated cation-releasing compounds are maintained physically separated, but from which the separated components may be dispensed synchronously by the consumer to combine the components at the time of use. An example of such a container is a two compartment dispensing container, such as a pump or tube, having collapsible sidewalls, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,487,757 and 4,687,663, which are each incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. The container body is formed from a collapsible plastic web and is provided with a partition within the container body defining separate compartments in which the physically<br>
separated components are stored and from which they are dispensed through a suitable dispensing outlet.<br>
[0038]    A method for reducing or preventing dry mouth in an oral cavity in accordance with the present invention may include the steps of delivering into the oral cavity a composition containing a mucoadhesive polymer and water-insoluble capsules containing a cation-releasing compound, releasing the cation-releasing compound from the capsules in the oral cavity, releasing cations from the cation-releasing compound, exposing the mucoadhesive polymer to the cations, and adhering the mucoadhesive polymer to oral surfaces in the oral cavity.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
