				<td>[DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION] [0001]<br>
[Field of Utilization in Industry]<br>
This invention relates to a frame structure involving the configuration of a rear frame and attaching mechanism of main<br>
stand of a scooter type vehicle. [0002]<br>
[Prior Art]<br>
In the conventional scooter type vehicle, as shown in Japanese Utility Model Publication Sho No. 60-20546, a hole for<br>
inserting a down frame is formed at the bottom end of a rear frame in the after-process, a rear end of the down frame is inserted to the bottom end hole of the rear frame, and the inserted portion is then welded. [0003]<br>
[Problem to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
In the above-mentioned scooter type vehicle, because the down frame and rear frame are orthogonally fixed each other, the stress is apt to concentrate to the joint, and to reinforce the joint, a gusset is integrally combined with the rear frame, the rear end of the down frame is inserted to a hole of the gusset and the gusset and down frame are integrally combined each other by welding. [0004]<br>
In the scooter type vehicle, because a rear wheel is engaged with the output shaft of a heavy power unit comprising an integrated structure containing an internal combustion engine, clutch, and transmission, the location of the center of gravity of the body deviates to the rear of the body, so the position to which a stand is attached should be positioned backward beyond the joint between the down frame and rear frame<br><br>
to lift up the wheel from the ground when the main frame stand is stood, as the result, because a heavy bending load is exerted on the reinforcing bracket if the reinforcing bracket of the joint between the down frame and rear frame is served as a stand attaching member, the use of a large-sized heavy-weight high-cost reinforcing bracket has been inevitable. [0005]<br>
[Means for Solving the Problem and Effects] The present invention involves the improvement of the frame structure of a scooter type vehicle form which such problem is eliminated, and the present invention provides a frame structure of a scooter type vehicle, in which a down frame extending back-downward from a head pipe and horizontally extending backward under a floor is integrally combined at the rear end of the down frame to a rear frame rising back-upward, and a power unit is swingably supported under the rear frame, wherein the front bottom of the rear frame is curved back-downward and is extended backward so as to cover under the power unit, and a main stand is attached to the rear end of the rear extending portion of the rear frame. [0006]<br>
In the scooter type vehicle of the present invention, because the front bottom of the rear frame rising back-upward is curved back-downward, and extended backward, and a main stand is attached to the rear end of the rear extending portion of the rear frame, a large-sized heavy-weight main stand for<br>
supporting heavy load is not required and the number of required parts and man-hour for assembling are reduced and the weight and cost are reduced. [0007]<br>
Because the lower rear extending portion of the rear frame extends backward so as to cover the front rear of the power unit, the front bottom of the power unit is protected from scattering rocks and curbs. [0008]<br>
A scooter type motorcycle of the present invention is structured as described in the claim 2, the expansive space for accommodating the power unit in rear of the rear frame is thereby afforded. [0009]<br>
A scooter type motorcycle of the present invention is structured as described in the claim 3, the rear end and the 'curved bottom of the rear frame are easily and strongly combined each other.<br>

[0026]<br>
In the embodiment shown in Fig. 1 to Fig. 10, the front lower portion 7a of the rear frame 7 is curved back-downward, and subsequently extended backward, and the main stand bracket 10 is integrally combined with the rear end of the lower rear extending portion 7d, the main stand 11 is swingably joined to the main stand bracket 10, so the heavy bending load is loaded on the lower rear extending portion 7d of the rear frame 7 when the main stand 11 is swung to stand and the scooter type motorcycle 1 is supported by the main stand 11 differently from the conventional stand attaching member in which the heavy bending load is loaded on the main stand bracket 10, thus the main stand bracket 10 can be minimized and made light weight.<br>
[0027]<br>
The lower rear extending portion 7d of the rear frame 7 is integrally combined with the rear frame 7, the possibility of reduction of strength due to welding is eliminated, the structure is strong, the process for fabrication is simplified, and the cost can be saved.<br>
[0028]<br>
Because the lower rear extending portion 7d of the rear frame 7 extends backward so as to cover the front rear of the power unit 21, the bottom of the crank case of the internal combustion engine 22 is protected from scattering rocks and<br>
curb. [0029]<br>
Because the rear frame 7 has a hollow rectangular cross-section with a longer size in the body width direction than the vertical direction, the space in the front-rear direction near the rising portion 7b of the rear frame 7 and the space in the vertical direction near the upper rear end 7e of the frame 7 become small to afford the free space, thus the length in the front-rear direction and height of the scooter type motorcycle 1 can be reduced, and the scooter type motorcycle can be made small sized. [0030J<br>
Further, because the rear end 6a of the down frame 6 having a circular cross-section, is slightly curved and the upper face thereof is formed flat so as to fit to the curved lower face of the rear frame 7, the down frame 6 and rear frame 7 are combined securely. [0031]<br>
Because the gusset 8 is placed on the upper face of 'the horizontal rear 6b of the down frame 6 positioned in front of the contact between the down frame 6 and rear frame 7 and on the front face of the rising portion 7b of the rear frame 7 positioned above the contact between the down frame 6 and rear frame 7, and the rear gusset 9 is placed on the rear face and both sides of the curved portion 7c gradually curved backward above the rising portion 7b of the rear frame 7, both edges of<br>
both contacts are integrally combined by welding, the joint portion between the down frame 6 and rear frame 7 on which the heavy load is loaded is significantly reinforced rigidly, as the result, the plate thickness and overall size can be reduced, and the body frame 2 can be made small sized and light weight. [0032]<br>
In the embodiment shown in Fig. 1 to Fig. 10, the main stand 11 is joined to the main stand bracket 10, however alternately as shown in Fig. 11 and Fig. 12, a sleeve 45 directed to the body width direction is inserted through the lower rear extending portion 7d of the rear frame 7 and the engaging portion is welded, and a spring hook shaft 46 is integrally projected, the pivots lie of the main stand 11 is engaged with the both ends of the sleeve 45, then a collar 47 is engaged with the space between the one side of the lower rear extending portion 7d of the rear frame 7 on the side provided with the spring hook shaft 46 and the pivot lie, and a pivot shaft 12 is inserted to the pivots lie of the main stand 11 and the sleeve 45, thus in this embodiment, the main stand bracket 10 is not necessary, the structure is therefore more simplified.<br>
