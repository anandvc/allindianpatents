GENE THERAPY FOR SPINAL CORD DISORDERS<br>
[01] This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. ยง 119(e) to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/677,213, filed May 2, 2005, and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/790,217, filed April 8, 2006, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[02] The present invention relates to compositions and methods for treating disorders affecting a subject's motor function and in particular, motor function affected by disease or injury to the brain and/or spinal cord.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[03] Gene therapy is an emerging treatment modality for disorders affecting the central nervous system (CNS). CNS gene therapy has been facilitated by the development of viral vectors capable of effectively infecting post-mitotic neurons. The central nervous system is made up of the spinal cord and the brain. The spinal cord conducts sensory information from the peripheral nervous system to the brain and conducts motor information from the brain to various effectors. For a review of viral vectors for gene delivery to the central nervous system, see Davidson et al. (2003) Nature Rev. 4:353-364.<br>
[04] Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors are considered useful for CNS gene therapy because they have a favorable toxicity and immunogenicity profile, are able to transduce neuronal cells, and are able to mediate long-term expression in the CNS (Kaplitt et al. (1994) Nat. Genet. 8:148-154; Bartlett et al. (1998) Hum. Gene Ther. 9:1181-1186; and Passini et al. (2002) J. Neurosci. 22:6437-6446).<br>
[05] One useful property of AAV vectors lies in the ability of some AAV vectors to undergo retrograde and/or anterograde transport in neuronal cells. Neurons in one brain region are interconnected by axons to distal brain regions thereby providing a transport system for vector delivery. For example, an AAV vector<br>
1<br><br>
WO 2006/119341	PCT/US2006/016943<br>
may be administered at or near the axon terminals of neurons. The neurons internalize the AAV vector and transport it in a retrograde manner along the axon to the cell body. Similar properties of adenovirus, HSV, and pseudo-rabies virus have been shown to deliver genes to distal structures within the brain (Soudas et al. (2001) FASEB J. 15:2283-2285; Breakefield etal. (1991) New Biol. 3:203-218; and deFalco et al. (2001) Science, 291:2608-2613).<br>
[06] Several groups have reported that the transduction of the brain by AAV serotype 2 (AAV2) is limited to the intracranial injection site (Kaplitt et al. (1994) Nat. Genet. 8:148-154; Passini etal. (2002) J. Neurosci. 22:6437-6446; and Chamberlin et al. (1998) Brain Res. 793:169-175). Recent reports suggest that retrograde axonal transport of neurotropic viral vectors can also occur in select circuits of the normal rat brain (Kaspar et al. (2002) Mol. Ther. 5:50-56 (AAV vector); Kasper et al. (2003) Science 301:839-842 (lentiviral vector) and Azzouz et al. (2004) Nature 429:413-417 (lentiviral vector). Roaul et al. (2005) Nat. Med. 11(4):423-428 and Ralph et al. (2005) Nat. Med. 11(4):429-433 report that intramuscular injection of lentivirus expressing silencing human Cu/Zn supreoxide dismutase (SOD1) interfering RNA retarded disease onset of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in a therapeutically relevant rodent model of ALS.<br>
[07] Cells transduced by AAV vectors may express a therapeutic transgene product, such as an enzyme or a neurotrophic factor, to mediate beneficial effects intracellularly. These cells may also secrete the therapeutic transgene product, which may be subsequently taken up by distal cells where it may mediate its beneficial effects. This process has been described as cross-correction (Neufeld et al. (1970) Science 169:141-146).<br>
[08] However, a need still exists for compositions and methods to treat dysfunction of the spinal cord that result in loss of motor function in human patients. This invention satisfies this need and provides related advantages as well.<br>

WO 2006/119341	PCT/US2006/016943<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[09] This invention provides methods and compositions to deliver a transgene to the spinal cord and/ or the brainstem region of a subject by administering a recombinant neurotropic viral vector containing the transgene to at least one region of the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) region of the subject's brain. The viral delivery is under conditions that favor expression of the transgene in the spinal cord and/ or the brainstem region.<br>
[010] In another aspect, the invention provides methods and compositions to deliver a transgene to a subject's spinal cord by administering a recombinant neurotropic viral vector containing the transgene to the motor cortex region of the subject's brain. The delivery of the viral vector is under conditions that favor expression of the transgene in the spinal cord. Viral vectors administered to the motor cortex region are internalized by motor neurons via their cell body region and the transgene is expressed. The expressed transgene may then undergo anterograde transport to the axon terminal portion of the motor neuron, which is present in the spinal cord. Due to the nature of the motor cortex, viral vectors administered to this region of the brain may also be internalized by axon terminals of motor neurons. The viral vector also may undergo retrograde transport along the motor neuron's axon and be expressed in the cell body of the motor neuron.<br>
[011] Further provided are compositions and methods to deliver a transgene to a motor neuron in a subject by administering a recombinant neurotropic viral vector containing the transgene to at least one region of the deep cerebellar nuclei region of the subject's brain. The delivery of the vector is under conditions that favor expression of the transgene in a motor neuron distal to the site of administration.<br>
[012] Also provided are methods and compositions to deliver a transgene to a motor neuron in a subject by administering a neurotropic viral vector containing the transgene to the motor cortex region of the subject's brain and wherein the<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2006/119341	PCT/US2006/016943<br>
administration is under conditions that favor expression of the transgene in a motor neuron distal to the site of administration.<br>
[013] In an alternate aspect, the invention provides compositions and methods to treat a motor neuron disorder in a subject by administering a recombinant neurotropic viral vector containing a therapeutic transgene to at least one region of the deep cerebeilar nuclei region of the subject's brain. Administration is done under conditions that favor expression of a therapeutically effective amount of the transgene in at least one subdivision of the spinal cord and/ or the brainstem region.<br>
[014] In yet a further aspect, the invention provides compositions and method to ameliorate the symptoms of a motor neuron disorder in a subject by administering a recombinant neurotropic viral vector containing the therapeutic transgene to the motor cortex region of the subject's brain and under conditions that favor expression of the transgene in a therapeutically effective amount in at least one subdivision of the spinal cord and/ or the brainstem region.<br>
[015] It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention as claimed.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES<br>
[016] Figure 1 is a schematic of how the DCN could be used to transport therapeutic virus to the spinal cord. Lines originating within the black box outlining the DCN represent axons terminals originating from cell bodies (arrowheads) localized within the spinal cord.<br>

[018] Figure 3 is a schematic view of the cerebellum which has been cut along the line of the vermis (sagittal section) and then flattened, as well as a horizontal section through the spinal cord and a representation of skeletal musculature. It shows the major afferent (input) pathways.<br>
[019] Figure 4 is a diagram showing the major efferent pathways (outputs) of the DCN.<br>
[020] Figure 5 schematically shows the neural circuits in the cerebral cortex, linking the inputs to the outputs. The climbing fibers originate in the inferior olive, which itself receives inputs from the cerebral cortex, spinal cord and special senses (visual and auditory). Mossy fiber inputs originate from all other afferents such as vestibular afferents, spinal afferents, muscle spindles, golgi-tendon organs, joint receptors, skin receptors and the cerebral cortex. There are also three types of inhibitor intemeurones in the intrinsic system, including basket cells, golgi cells and stellate cells. These are involved in lateral inhibition and in fine tuning of motor neuron function.<br>

Figure 12B illustrates the connections between the deep cerebellar nuclei regions (medial, interposed, and lateral) and the brainstem regions (midbrain, pons, and medulla). The connections are represented by arrows, which start at the cell body region of a neuron and end at the axon terminal region of the neuron. For example, the three regions of the<br>

DCN each have neurons with cell bodies that send axons that terminate in the cervical region of the spinal cord while the cervical region of the spinal cord has cell bodies that send axons that terminate in either the medial or interposed regions of the DCN.<br>

[037] Figure 21 illustrates the increase in survival mediated by DCN delivery of AAV encoding for IGF-1 as compared to DCN delivery of AAV encoding for GFP.<br>
[038] Figure 22 shows GFP distribution within the mouse brain following bilateral delivery of a GFP expressing AAV1 vector to the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN). In addition to the DCN, GFP positive staining was also observed in the olfactory bulbs, cerebral cortex, thalamus, brainstem, cerebellar cortex and spinal cord. All of these areas either receive projections from and/or send projections to the DCN.<br>

For example, where the purpose of the experiment is to determine a correlation of an altered expression level of a gene with a particular type of pathology (see ALS, for example, infra), it is generally preferable to use a positive control (a subject or a sample from a subject, carrying such alteration and exhibiting symptoms characteristic of that disease), and a negative control (a subject or a sample from a subject lacking the altered expression and clinical symptom of that disease).<br>
[054] "Differentially expressed" as applied to a gene, refers to the differential production of the mRNA transcribed from the gene or the protein product encoded by the gene. A differentially expressed gene may be overexpressed or underexpressed as compared to the expression level of a normal or control cell. In one aspect, it refers to a differential that is at least 1.5 times, or at least 2.5 times, or alternatively at least 5 times, or alternatively at least 10 times higher or lower than the expression level detected in a control sample. The term "differentially expressed" also refers to nucleotide sequences in a cell or tissue<br>
12<br><br>
WO 2006/119341	PCT/US2006/016943<br>
which are expressed where silent in a control cell or not expressed where expressed in a control cell.<br>
[055] As used herein, the term "modulate" means to vary the amount or intensity of an effect or outcome, e.g., to enhance, augment, diminish or reduce.<br>
[056] As used herein the term "ameliorate" is synonymous with "alleviate" and means to reduce or lighten. For example one may ameliorate the symptoms of a disease or disorder by making them more bearable.<br>
[057] In aspects where gene transfer is mediated by a DNA viral vector, such as an adenovirus (Ad) or adeno-associated virus (AAV), a vector construct refers to the polynucleotide comprising the viral genome or part thereof, and a transgene. Adenoviruses (Ads) are a relatively well characterized, homogenous group of viruses, including over 50 serotypes. See, e.g., International PCT Application No. WO 95/27071. Ads are easy to grow and do not require integration into the host cell genome. Recombinant Ad derived vectors, particularly those that reduce the potential for recombination and generation of wild-type virus, have also been constructed. See, International PCT Application Nos. WO 95/00655 and WO 95/11984. Wild-type AAV has high infectivity and specificity integrating into the host cell's genome. See, Hermonat and Muzyczka (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:6466-6470 and Lebkowski, etal. (1988) Mol. Cell. Biol. 8:3988-3996.<br>
[058] The invention provides a method to deliver a transgene to the spinal cord and/ or brainstem in a subject by administering a recombinant neurotropic viral vector containing a transgene to at least one region of the deep cerebellar nuclei region of the brain, wherein the delivery is under conditions that favor expression of the transgene at a site distal to the site of administration. The delivery may also result in expression of the transgene at the site of administration.<br>
[059] Unless specifically indicated to the contrary, expression of the transgene is not limited to translation to a polypeptide or protein but also includes replication and/or transcription of the transgene polynucleotide.<br>
13<br><br>
WO 2006/119341	PCT/US2006/016943<br>
[060] In another aspect, the invention provides a method of delivering a therapeutic transgene product to a target cell of the CNS, which is a neuron or a glial cell, in a mammal afflicted with a motor neuronal disorder, e.g., ALS or traumatic spinal cord injury. The transgene may encode for IGF-1.<br>
[061] In another aspect, the invention is a method to deliver a transgene to the spinal cord in a subject by administering a recombinant neurotropic viral vector containing said transgene to the motor cortex region of the brain, wherein said delivery is under conditions that favor expression of said transgene at a site distal to said site of administration.<br>
[062] In a yet further aspect, the invention the viral vector is administered to at least one region of the deep cerebellar nuclei region of the brain where the transgene product is expressed and delivered to the spinal cord and/ or the brainstem region of the subject.<br>
[063] In another embodiment, the viral vector is administered to at least one region of the deep cerebellar nuclei region of the brain that is interconnected with brainstem and spinal motor neurons. These targeted regions have direct connections with cells (e.g., intemeurons and astrocytes) that compose the motor neuron's cellular environment. The administration delivers the transgene product to the motor neuron's cellular environment, where the product mediates a beneficial effect on the cells that compose it.<br>
[064] In one embodiment, the invention is a method to deliver a transgene to or modulate its expression, in a motor neuron in a subject by administering a neurotropic viral vector containing the transgene to the motor cortex region of the brain of the subject, wherein the transgene is expressed in a region of the motor neuron distal to said site of administration.<br>
[065] In an alternate embodiment, the invention is a method to treat a motor neuron disorder in a subject by administering a recombinant neurotropic viral<br>
14<br><br>
WO 2006/119341	PCT/US2006/016943<br>
vector containing a therapeutic transgene to at least one region of the deep cerebellar nuclei region of the brain of the subject, wherein the transgene is expressed in a therapeutically effective amount in at least one subdivision of the spinal cord of the subject. These subdivisions include one or more of cervical, thoracic, lumbar or sacral (see Figure 1, Figure 12A). The transgene may also be expressed in a therapeutically effective amount in at least one region of the brainstem, such as, for example, the midbrain, pons, or medulla (see Figure 12B). It may also be expressed in a therapeutically effective amount in both at least one region of the brainstem and in at least one subdivision of the spinal cord of the subject.<br>
[066] This invention also is a method to ameliorate the symptoms of a motor neuron disorder in a subject by administering a recombinant neurotropic viral vector containing a therapeutic transgene to the motor cortex region of the brain, wherein said transgene is expressed in a therapeutically effective amount in at least one subdivision of the spinal cord of the subject. These subdivisions include one or more of cervical, thoracic, lumbar or sacral (see Figure 1, Figure 12A).<br>
[067] Suitable neurotropic viral vectors for the practice of this invention include, but are not limited to adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV), herpes simplex viral vectors (U.S. Patent No. 5,672,344) and lentiviral vectors.<br>
[068] In the methods of the invention, AAV of any serotype can be used. In certain embodiments, AAV of any serotype can be used so long as the vector is capable of undergoing retrograde axonal transport in a disease-compromised brain, or axonal transport in a non-compromised brain. The serotype of the viral vector used in certain embodiments of the invention is selected from the group consisting from AAV1, AAV2, AAV3, AAV4, AAV5, AAV6, AAV7, and AAV8 (see, e.g., Gao et al. (2002) PNAS, 99:11854-11859; and Viral Vectors for Gene Therapy: Methods and Protocols, ed. Machida, Humana Press, 2003). Other serotype besides those listed herein can be used. Furthermore, pseudotyped AAV vectors may also be utilized in the methods described herein. Pseudotyped<br>
15<br><br>
WO 2006/119341	PCT/US2006/016943<br>
AAV vectors are those which contain the genome of one AAV serotype in the capsid of a second AAV serotype; for example, an AAV vector that contains the AAV2 capsid and the AAV1 genome or an AAV vector that contains the AAV5 capsid and the AAV 2 genome (Auricchio et al., (2001) Hum. Mol. Genet., 10(26):3075-81).<br>
[069] AAV vectors are derived from single-stranded (ss) DNA parvoviruses that are nonpathogenic for mammals (reviewed in Muzyscka (1992) Curr. Top. Microb. Immunol., 158:97-129). Briefly, AAV-based vectors have the rep and cap viral genes that account for 96% of the viral genome removed, leaving the two flanking 145-basepair (bp) inverted terminal repeats (ITRs), which are used to initiate viral DNA replication, packaging and integration. In the absence of helper virus, wild-type AAV integrates into the human host-cell genome with preferential site-specificity at chromosome 19q 13.3 or it may remain expressed episomally. A single AAV particle can accommodate up to 5 kb of ssDNA, therefore leaving about 4.5 kb for a transgene and regulatory elements, which is typically sufficient. However, trans-splicing systems as described, for example, in United States Patent No. 6,544,785, may nearly double this limit.<br>
[070] In an illustrative embodiment, AAV is AAV2 or AAV1. Adeno-associated virus of many serotypes, especially AAV2, have been extensively studied and characterized as gene therapy vectors. Those skilled in the art will be familiar with the preparation of functional AAV-based gene therapy vectors. Numerous references to various methods of AAV production, purification and preparation for administration to human subjects can be found in the extensive body of published literature (see, e.g., Viral Vectors for Gene Therapy: Methods and Protocols, ed. Machida, Humana Press, 2003). Additionally, AAV-based gene therapy targeted to cells of the CNS has been described in United States Patent Nos. 6,180,613 and 6,503,888. Additional exemplary AAV vectors are recombinant AAV2/1, AAV2/2, AAV2/5, AAV2/7 and AAV2/8 serotype vectors encoding human protein.<br>
[071] In certain methods of the invention, the vector comprises a transgene operably linked to a promoter. The transgene encodes a biologically active<br>
16<br><br>
WO 2006/119341	PCT/US2006/016943<br>
molecule, expression of which in the CNS results in at least partial correction of neuropathology. The genomic and functional cDNA sequences of human ASM have been published (see, e.g., United States Patent No. 5,773,278 and 6,541,218). The Insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) gene has a complex structure, which is well-known in the art. It has at least two alternatively spliced mRNA products arising from the gene transcript. There is a 153 amino acid peptide, known by several names including IGF-1 A or IGF-1 Ea, and a 195 amino acid peptide, known by several names including IGF-1 B or IGF-1 Eb. The mature form of IGF-1 is a 70 amino acid polypeptide. Both IGF-1 Ea and IGF-1 Eb contain the 70 amino acid mature peptide, but differ in the sequence and length of their carboxyl-terminal extensions. The peptide sequences of IGF-1 Ea and IGF-1 Eb are represented by SEQ ID NOS: 1 and 2, respectively. The genomic and functional cDNAs of human IGF-1, as well as additional information regarding the IGF-1 gene and its products, are available at Unigene Accession No. NM-00618.<br>
[072] The level of transgene expression in eukaryotic cells is largely determined by the transcriptional promoter within the transgene expression cassette. Promoters that show long-term activity and are tissue- and even cell-specific are used in some embodiments. Nonlimiting examples of promoters include, but are not limited to, the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter (Kaplitt et al. (1994) Nat. Genet. 8:148-154), CMV/human [33-globin promoter (Mandel et al. (1998) J. Neurosci. 18:4271-4284), GFAP promoter (Xu et al. (2001) Gene Ther. 8:1323-1332), the 1.8-kb neuron-specific enolase (NSE) promoter (Klein et al. (1998) Exp. Neurol. 150:183-194), chicken beta actin (CBA) promoter (Miyazaki (1989) Gene 79:269-277), the (3-glucuronidase (GUSB) promoter (Shipley et al. (1991) Genetics 10:1009-1018), and ubiquitin promoters such as those isolated from human ubiquitin A, human ubiquitin B, and human ubiquitin C as described in US Patent No. 6,667,174. To prolong expression, other regulatory elements may additionally be operably linked to the transgene, such as, e.g., the Woodchuck Hepatitis Virus Post-Regulatory Element (WPRE) (Donello et al. (1998) J. Virol. 72:5085-5092) or the bovine growth hormone (BGH) polyadenylation site.<br>

WO 2006/119341	PCT/US2006/016943<br>
[073] For some CNS gene therapy applications, it may be necessary to control transcriptional activity. To this end, pharmacological regulation of gene expression with viral vectors can been obtained by including various regulatory elements and drug-responsive promoters as described, for example, in Habermaet al. (1998) Gene Ther. 5:1604-16011; and Ye et al. (1995) Science 283:88-91.<br>
[074] In the methods of this invention, the viral vector can be administered by contacting an terminal axonal ending of a neuron with a composition containing a viral vector carrying the transgene, allowing the viral particle to be endocytosed and transported intracellularly (retrogradely) along the axon to the cell body of the neuron; allowing the therapeutic transgene product to be expressed, wherein the therapeutic transgene product thereby alleviates pathology in the subject. The effect may be on motor neurons, on cells that compose the motor neuron environment (such as intemeurons and astrocytes), or on both. In certain embodiments, the concentration of the vector in the composition is at least: (a) 5, 6, 7, 8, 8.4, 9, 9.3, 10, 15, 20, 25, or 50 (*1012 gp/ml); (b) 5, 6, 7, 8, 8.4, 9, 9.3, 10, 15, 20, 25, or 50 (x109 tu/ml); or (c) 5, 6, 7, 8, 8.4, 9, 9.3, 10, 15, 20, 25, or 50 (x1010 iu/ml).<br>
[075] In additional methods of this invention, the viral vector can be administered by contacting the cell body of a neuron with a composition containing a viral vector carrying the transgene, allowing the viral particle to be endocytosed, allowing the therapeutic transgene product to be expressed and transported anterogradely intracellularly along the axon to the axon terminal of the neuron, wherein the therapeutic transgene product thereby alleviates pathology in the subject. The effect may be on motor neurons, on cells that compose the motor neuron environment (such as intemeurons and astrocytes), or on both. In certain embodiments, the concentration of the vector in the composition is at least: (a) 5, 6, 7, 8, 8.4, 9, 9.3, 10, 15, 20, 25, or 50 (x1012 gp/ml); (b) 5, 6, 7, 8, 8.4, 9, 9.3, 10,15, 20, 25, or 50 (x109 tu/ml); or(c) 5, 6, 7, 8, 8.4, 9, 9.3, 10, 15, 20, 25, or 50 (x1010 iu/ml).<br>

[076] In one aspect, the transgene encodes a biologically active molecule, expression of which in the CNS results in at least partial correction of neuropathology. In some embodiments, the therapeutic transgene product is an RNA molecule that inhibits expression of SOD in a subject thereby alleviating and preventing the symptoms of ALS. See Roaul et al. (2005) Nat. Med. 11(4):423-428 and Ralph et al. (2005) Nat. Med. 11(4):429-433.<br>
[077] In one aspect when performing these methods, the transgene expresses a therapeutic amount of a protein selected from the group consisting of insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1), calbindin D28, parvalbumin, HIF1-alpha, SIRT-2, VEGF, EPO (erythropoietin), CBP (cAMP response element binding protein [CREB] binding protein), SMN-1, SMN-2, and CNTF (Ciliary neurotrophic factor).<br>
[078] Alternatively, the transgene inhibits expression of a mutant form of a protein, e.g., mutant SOD that results in ALS. Roaul et al. (2005) supra and Ralph et al. (2005) supra.<br>

Figure 1 schematically shows the spinal cord and its four subdivisions: cervical, thoracic, lumbar and sacral.<br>
[080] The subject invention provides methods to modulate, correct or augment motor function in a subject afflicted with motor neuronal damage. For the purpose of illustration only, the subject may suffer from one or more of amytrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), spinal bulbar muscular atrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, spinal cerebellar ataxia, primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), or traumatic spinal cord injury.<br>
19<br><br>
WO 2006/119341	PCT/US2006/016943<br>
[081] Without being limited as to theory, the pathology associated with motor neuron damage may include motor neuron degeneration, gliosis, neurofilament abnormalities, loss of myelinated fibers in corticospinal tracts and ventral roots. For example, two types of onset have been recognized: bulbar onset, which affects the upper motor neurons (cortex and brainstem motor neurons), affects the facial muscles, speech, and swallowing; and limb onset, which affects the lower motor neurons (spinal cord motor neurons), is reflected by spasticity, generalized weakness, muscular atrophy, paralysis, and respiratory failure. In ALS, subjects have both bulbar and limb onset. In PLS, subjects have bulbar onset.<br>
[082] Without being limited as to theory, one embodiment of the invention lies in the ability to provide a therapeutic molecule (for example, a protein or peptide) to each division of the spinal cord. This may be accomplished by injecting an AAV vector into the DCN. Furthermore, it may be important to target individual lamina within each spinal cord division. Lamina are specific sub-regions within regions of the brain and spinal cord. It may be desirable in certain embodiments to target specific lamina within a certain spinal cord division. Since motor neuron damage may occur within the upper motor neurons as well, it may also be desirable to provide a therapeutic molecule (for example, a protein or peptide) to the divisions of the brainstem. In one embodiment, it may be desirable to provide the therapeutic molecule to both the spinal cord, including some or all subdivisions as well as to the brainstem, including some or all subdivisions. The instant invention uses the introduction of an AAV vector into the DCN to accomplish the above described delivery of a therapeutic molecule to the spinal cord region(s) and/ or brainstem. Figure 12A illustrates the connections between the deep cerebellar nuclei regions and the spinal cord while Figure 12B illustrates the connections between the deep cerebellar nuclei regions and the brainstem.<br>
[083] The ability to organize and execute complex motor acts depends on signals from the motor areas in the cerebral cortex, i.e., the motor cortex. Cortical motor commands descend in two tracts. The corticobular fibers control<br>
20<br><br>
WO 2006/119341	PCT/US2006/016943<br>
the motor nuclei in the brain stem that move facial muscles and the corticospinal fibers control the spinal motor neurons that innervate the trunk and limb muscles. The cerebral cortex also indirectly influences spinal motor activity by acting on the descending brain stem pathways.<br>
[084] The primary motor cortex lies along the precentral gyms in Broadmann's area (4). The axons of the cortical neurons that project to the spinal cord run together in the corticospinal tract, a massive bundle of fibers containing about 1 million axons. About a third of these originate from the precentral gyms of the frontal lobe. Another third originate from area 6. The remainder originates in areas 3, 2, and 1 in the somatic sensory cortex and regulate transmission of afferent input through the dorsal horn.<br>
[085] The corticospinal fibers run together with corticobulbar fibers through the posterior limb of the internal capsule to reach the ventral portion of the midbrain. They separate in the pons into small bundles of fibers that course between the pontine nuclei. They regroup in the medulla to form the medullary pyramid. About three-quarters of the corticospinal fibers cross the midline in the pyramidal decussation at the junction of the medulla and spinal cord. The crossed fibers descend in the dorsal part of the lateral columns (dorsolateral column) of the spinal cord, forming the lateral corticospinal tract. The uncrossed fibers descend in the ventral columns as the ventral corticospinal tract.<br>
[086] The lateral and ventral divisions of the corticospinal tract terminate in about the same regions of spinal gray matter as the lateral and media! systems of the brain stem. The lateral corticospinal tract projects primarily to motor nuclei in the lateral part of the ventral horn and to interneurons in the intermediate zone. The ventral corticospinal tract projects bilaterally to the ventromedial cell column and to adjoining portions of the intermediate zone that contain the motor neuorons that innervate axial muscles. Figure 3 schematically shows the major afferent (input) pathways.<br>

WO 2006/119341	PCT/US2006/016943<br>
[087] Deep within the cerebellum is grey matter called the deep cerebellar nuclei termed the medial (fastigial) nucleus, the interposed (interpositus) nucleus and the lateral (dentate) nucleus. As used herein, the term "deep cerebellar nuclei" collectively refers to these three regions. Figure 2 schematically shows the three regions of the DCN. Figure 4 schematically shows the major efferent (output) pathways from the DCN. Figure 5 schematically shows the neural circuits in the cerebral cortex. Figures 12A and 12B schematically show connections between the DCN and the spinal cord or the brainstem, respectively.<br>
[088] If desired, the human brain structure can be correlated to similar structures in the brain of another mammal. For example, most mammals, including humans and rodents, show a similar topographical organization of the entorhinal-hippocampus projections, with neurons in the lateral part of both the lateral and medial entorhinal cortex projecting to the dorsal part or septal pole of the hippocampus, whereas the projection to the ventral hippocampus originates primarily from neurons in medial parts of the entorhinal cortex (Principles of Neural Science, 4th ed., eds Kandel et al., McGraw-Hill, 1991; The Rat Nervous System, 2nd ed., ed. Paxinos, Academic Press, 1995). Furthermore, layer II cells of the entorhinal cortex project to the dentate gyrus, and they terminate in the outer two-thirds of the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. The axons from layer III cells project bilaterally to the cornu ammonis areas CA1 and CA3 of the hippocampus, terminating in the stratum lacunose molecular layer.<br>
[089] In one aspect, the disclosed methods include administering to the CNS of an afflicted subject a neurotropic viral vector carrying a transgene encoding a therapeutic product and allowing the transgene to be expressed within the CNS distally from the administration site at a therapeutic level. In addition, the vector may comprise a polynucleotide encoding for a biologically active molecule effective to treat the CNS disorder. Such biologically active molecules may comprise peptides including but not limited to native or mutated versions of full-length proteins, native or mutated versions of protein fragments, synthetic polypeptides, antibodies, and antibody fragments such as Fab' molecules. Biologically active molecules may also comprise nucleotides including single-<br>
22<br><br>
WO 2006/119341	PCT/US2006/016943<br>
stranded or double-stranded DNA polynucleotides and single-stranded or double-stranded RNA polynucleotides. For a review of exemplary nucleotide technologies that may be used in the practice of the methods disclosed herein, see Kurreck, (2003) J., Eur. J. Biochem. 270,1628-1644 [antisense technologies]; Yu et al., (2002) PNAS 99(9), 6047-6052 [RNA interference technologies]; and Elbashiretal., (2001) Genes Dev., 15(2):188-200 [siRNA technology].<br>
[090] In an illustrative embodiment, the administration is accomplished by direct injection of a high titer vector solution into the DCN of a subject or patient. For example, the administration is by direct injection into one or more deep cerebellar nuclei region of the brain selected from the group consisting of the medial (fastigial) region, interposed (interpositus) region and the lateral (dentate) region. The DCN is an attractive site for injection due to its extensive efferent and afferent connections with the brainstem and spinal cord. These cells provide an efficient and minimally invasive means to deliver viral vector and expressed transgene to the spinal cord regions and the brainstem regions. Without being limited as to theory, the viral vector may be taken up by the axon terminals and transported retrogradely along the axon to the cell body of these neurons, which project throughout in the spinal cord region and/or brainstem. Cell bodies of neurons are also present in the DCN that have axon terminal endings that terminate, for example, in the cervical region of the spinal cord. Viral vector taken up by these cell bodies, or expressed transgene resulting from the viral vector or both, may be anterogradely transported to the axon terminal endings in the cervical spinal region. Therefore, by using the DCN as an injection site, only a small volume of viral vector is injected but this mediates significant transgene expression throughout one or more regions in the spinal cord and/or the brainstem.<br>
[091] In some embodiments, the methods comprise administration of a high titer neurotropic vector carrying a therapeutic transgene so that the transgene product is expressed at a therapeutic level in a second site within the CNS distal to the first site. In some embodiments, the viral titer of the composition is at least: (a) 5,<br>
23<br><br>
WO 2006/119341	PCT/US2006/016943<br>
6, 7, 8, 8.4, 9, 9.3, 10, 15, 20, 25, or 50 (x1012 gp/ml); (b) 5, 6, 7, 8, 8.4, 9, 9.3, 10, 15, 20, 25, or 50 (*109 tu/ml); or (c) 5, 6, 7, 8, 8.4, 9, 9.3, 10, 15, 20, 25, or 50 (*1010 iu/ml). In further embodiments, the administration is accomplished by direct intraparenchymal injection of a high titer neurotropic vector solution into the diseased brain, thereafter the transgene is expressed distally, contralaterally or ipsilaterally, to the administration site at a therapeutic level at least 2, 3, 5, 8 ,10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, or 50 mm from the administration site.<br>
[092] The distance between the first and the second sites is defined as the minimal distance region between the site of administration (first site) and the boundary of the detectable transduction of the distal site (second site) as measured using procedures known in the art or as described in the Examples, e.g., in situ hybridization. Some neurons in the CNS of larger mammals may span large distances by virtue of their axonal projections. For example, in humans, some axons may span a distance of 1000 mm or greater. Thus, in various methods of the invention, the vector can be axonally transported along the entire length of the axon at such a distance to reach and transduce the parent cell body.<br>
[093] A site of vector administration within the CNS is chosen based on the desired target region of neuropathology and the topology of brain circuits involved so long as an administration site and the target region have axonal connections. The target region can be defined, for example, using 3-D sterotaxic coordinates. In some embodiments, the administration site is chosen so that at least 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, or 10 % of the total amount of vector injected is delivered distally at the target region of at least 1, 200, 500, or 1000 mm3. An administration site may be localized in a region innervated by projection neurons connecting distal regions of the brain. For example, the substantial nigra and bventral segmental area send dense projections to the caudate and putamen (collectively known as the striatum). Neurons within the substantial nigra and ventral tegmentum can be targeted for transduction by retrograde transport of AAV following injection into the striatum. As another example, the hippocampus receives well-defined, predictable axonal projections from other regions of the brain. Other<br>
24<br><br>
WO 2006/119341	PCT/US2006/016943<br>
administration sites may be localized, for example, in the spinal cord, brainstem (medulla, midbrain, and pons), mesencephalon, cerebellum (including the deep cerebellar nuclei), diencephalon (thalamus, hypothalamus), telencephalon (corpus striatum, cerebral cortex, or, within the cortex, the occipital, temporal, parietal or frontal lobes), or combinations thereof.<br>
[094] The second (target) site can be located any region of the CNS, including the brain and the spinal cord, that contains a neurons that project to the first (administration) site. In some embodiments, the second site is in a region of the CNS chosen from the substantia nigra, the medulla oblongata, the brainstem, or the spinal cord.<br>
[095] To deliver the vector specifically to a particular region of the central nervous system, especially to a particular region of the brain, it may be administered by sterotaxic microinjection. For example, on the day of surgery, patients will have the sterotaxic frame base fixed in place (screwed into the skull). The brain with sterotaxic frame base (MRI-compatible with fiduciary markings) will be imaged using high resolution MRI. The MRI images will then be transferred to a computer that runs stereotaxic software. A series of coronal, sagittal and axial images will be used to determine the target site of vector injection, and trajectory. The software directly translates the trajectory into 3-dimensional coordinates appropriate for the stereotaxic frame. Burr holes are drilled above the entry site and the stereotaxic apparatus localized with the needle implanted at the given depth. The vector in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier will then be injected. The vector is then administrated by direct injection to the primary target site and retrogradely transported to distal target sites via axons. Additional routes of administration may be used, e.g., superficial cortical application under direct visualization, or other non-stereotaxic application.<br>
[096] In addition because each region of the DCN targets specific regions of the CNS (see Figure 1 and Figures 12A and 12B), one can specifically target the region of the CNS to which the transgene is delivered by pre-selecting the region of the DCN for administration. As is apparent to those of skill in the art, a<br>

multitude of dosing and targeted deliveries can be achieved by varying the location, sequence and number of transgene administrations. The total volume of material to be administered, and the total number of vector particles to be administered, will be determined by those skilled in the art based upon known aspects of gene therapy. Therapeutic effectiveness and safety can be tested in an appropriate animal model. For example, a variety of well-characterized animal models exist for LSDs, e.g., as described herein or in Watson et al. (2001) Methods Mol. Med. 76:383-403; or Jeyakumaretal. (2002) Neuropath. Appl. Neurobiol., 28:343-357 and ALS (see Tu et al. (1996) P.N.A.S. 93:3155-3160; Roaul et al. (2005) Nat. Med. 11(4):423-428 and Ralph et al. (2005) Nat. Med. 11(4):429-433).<br>
[097] In experimental mice, the total volume of injected AAV solution is for example, between 1 to 5 ul. For other mammals, including the human brain, volumes and delivery rates are appropriately scaled. For example, it has been demonstrated that volumes of 150 ul can be safely injected in the primate brain (Janson et al. (2002) Hum. Gene Ther. 13:1391-1412). Treatment may consist of a single injection per target site, or may be repeated along the injection tract, if necessary. Multiple injection sites can be used. For example, in some embodiments, in addition to the first administration site, a composition containing a viral vector carrying a transgene is administered to another site which can be contralateral or ipsilateral to the first administration site. Injections can be single or multiple, unilateral or bilateral.<br>
[098] High titer AAV preparations can be produced using techniques known in the art, e.g., as described in United States Patent No. 5,658,776 and Viral Vectors for Gene Therapy: Methods and Protocols, ed. Machida, Humana Press, 2003.<br>
[099] The following examples provide illustrative embodiments of the invention. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize the numerous modifications and variations that may be performed without altering the spirit or scope of the<br>

present invention. Such modifications and variations are encompassed within the scope of the invention. The examples do not in any way limit the invention.<br>
EXAMPLES Titration of Recombinant Vectors<br>
[0100] AAV vector titers were measured according to genome copy number (genome particles per milliliter). Genome particle concentrations were based on Taqmanยฎ PCR of the vector DNA as previously reported (Clark et al. (1999) Hum. Gene Ther., 10:1031-1039; Veldwijk et al. (2002) Mol. Then, 6:272-278). Briefly, purified AAV-ASM was treated with capsid digestion buffer (50mM Tris-HCI pH 8.0, 1.0 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 1.0 mg/ml proteinase K) at 50ยฐC for 1 hour to release vector DNA. DNA samples were put through a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primers that anneal to specific sequences in the vector DNA, such as the promoter region, transgene, or the poly A sequence. The PCR results were then quantified by a Real-time Taqmanยฎ software, such as that provided by the Perkin Elmer-Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) Prism 7700 Sequence Detector System.<br>
[0101] Vectors carrying an assayable marker gene such as the P-galactosidase or green fluorescent protein gene (GFP) can be titered using an infectivity assay. Susceptible cells (e.g., HeLa, or COS cells) are transduced with the AAV and an assay is performed to determine gene expression such as staining of (3-galactosidase vector-transduced cells with X-gal (5-bromo-4chloro-3-indolyl-p-D-galactopyranoside) or fluorescence microscopy for GFP-transduced cells. For example, the assay is performed as follows: 4 x104 HeLa cells are plated in each well of a 24-well culture plate using normal growth media. After attachment, i.e., about 24 hours later, the cells are infected with Ad type 5 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 and transduced with serial dilutions of the packaged vector and incubated at 37ยฐC. One to three days later, before extensive cytopathic effects are observed, the appropriate assay is performed on the cells (e.g., X-gal staining or fluorescence microscopy). If a reporter gene<br>

such as (3-galactosidase is used, the cells are fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, 0.5% glutaraldehyde and stained for (3-galactosidase activity using X-gal. Vector dilutions that give well-separated cells are counted. Each positive cell represents 1 transduction unit (tu) of vector.<br>
Expression of Functional Protein Deters Motor Impairment in a Therapeuticallv Relevant Mouse Model<br>
[0102] ASMKO mice are an accepted model of types A and B Niemann-Pick disease (Horinouchi et al. (1995) Nat. Genetics 10:288-293; Jin et al. (2002) J. Clin. Invest. 109:1183-1191; and Otterbach (1995) Cell 81:1053-1061). Niemann-Pick disease (NPD) is classified as a lysosomal storage disease and is an inherited neurometabolic disorder characterized by a genetic deficiency in acid sphingomyelinase (ASM; sphingomyelin cholinephosphohydrolase, EC 3.1.3.12). The lack of functional ASM protein results in the accumulation of sphingomyelin substrate within the lysosomes of neurons and glia throughout the brain. This leads to the formation of large numbers of distended lysosomes in the perikaryon, which are a hallmark feature and the primary cellular phenotype of type A NPD. The presence of distended lysosomes correlates with the loss of normal cellular function and a progressive neurodegenerative course that leads to death of the affected individual in early childhood (The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Diseases, eds. Scriver et al., McGraw-Hill, New York, 2001, pp. 3589-3610). Secondary cellular phenotypes (e.g., additional metabolic abnormalities) are also associated with this disease, notably the high level accumulation of cholesterol in the lysosomal compartment. Sphingomyelin has strong affinity for cholesterol, which results in the sequestering of large amounts of cholesterol in the lysosomes of ASMKO mice and human patients (Leventhal et al. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276:44976-44983; Slotte (1997) Subcell. Biochem. 28:277-293; and Viana et la. (1990) J. Med. Genet. 27:499-504.)<br>
[0103] The following experiment, evaluated the relative ability of recombinant AAV2/1, AAV2/2, AAV2/5, AAV2/7 and AAV2/8 serotype vectors encoding human ASM (hASM) to express hASM protein, correct cholesterol storage<br>

pathology, undergo transport, rescue Purkinje cells, and initiate functional recovery in the ASMKO mouse after unilateral injection within the deep cerebellar nuclei. An additional group of ASMKO mice received bilateral injections into the DCN in order to assess whether increased transgene protein spread/expression would improve behavioral functional recovery.<br>
[0104] Sixty-six male homozygous (-/-) acid sphingomyelinase knockout (ASMKO) mice and sixteen male wild type littermate controls were bred from heterozygote matings (+/-). Mice were genotyped by PCR following the procedure described in Gal et al. (1975) N Engl J Med:293:632-636. Mice from the original colony were backcrossed onto the C57/BI6 strain. Animals were housed under 12:12 hour lightdark cycle and provided with food and water ad libitum. All procedures were performed under a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.<br>
[0105] After being anesthetized with isoflurane, mice (~7 weeks of age) were unilaterally injected into the deep cerebellar nuclei (A-P: -5.75 from bregma, M-L: -1.8 from bregma, D-V: -2.6 from dura, incisor bar: 0.0) with one of the following AAV serotype vectors (n=8/vector): AAV1-CMV-pgal, AAV1-CMV-ASM, AAV2-CMV-ASM, AAV5-CMV-ASM, AAV7-CMV-ASM, and AAV8-CMV-ASM. Vectors were delivered with a 10 ul Hamilton syringe mounted on a syringe pump at a rate of 0.5 ul/minute for a total of 1.86 x 1010 genome particles per brain. The final injection volume for each vector was 4 ul. One hour before and twenty-four hours after surgery mice were given ketoprofen (5 mg/kg; SC) for analgesia.<br>
[0106] Mice were killed 7 weeks post-injection (14 weeks of age). At the time of sacrifice mice were overdosed with euthasol (150 mg/kg; IP) and rapidly decapitated (n=5/group) or transcardially perfused (n=3/group). Brains from decapitated mice were rapidly removed, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, dissected into 3 sections (right cerebral hemisphere, left cerebral hemisphere, &amp; cerebellum) homogenized, and analyzed for hASM by ELISA. Brains and spinal cords from perfused mice were processed for human ASM protein expression, cholesterol accumulation as detected by filipin staining, and Purkinje cell survival<br>

with calbindin staining on 50 jjrn vibratone sections. ASMKO mice that received bilateral injections (~7 weeks of age) of AAV2/1-pgal (n=8), AAV2/1-ASM (n=5), and AAV2/2-ASM (n=5) were sacrificed at 20 weeks of age after undergoing rotarod testing. Mice were tested by accelerating and rocking rotarod for motor function on the Smartrod (AccuScan) using methods known in the art. Exemplary methods are reproduced in Sleat et al. (2004) J. Neurosci. 24:9117-9126. Figures 10 and 11 graphically show the results of rotarod tests as a measurement of recovery of motor function.<br>
[0107] The full-length human ASM cDNA under the control of the human cytomegalovirus immediate-early (CMV) promoter, with an SV40 polyadenylation sequence, and a hybrid intron, was cloned into a plasmid containing ITRs from AAV serotype 2 (AAV2 ITR). Jin et al. (2002) J Clin Invest. 109:1183-1191. Hybrid vectors were produced by triple transfection using a series of helper plasmids containing serotype specific capsid coding domains in addition to the AAV type 2 replication genes. This strategy allows the packaging of AAV2 ITR vectors into each serotype-specific virion Rabinowitz, et al. (2002) J Virol. 76:791-801. With this approach the hASM recombinant genome was used to generate a series of rAAV-hASM vectors of various serotypes including AAV2/1, AAV2/2, AAV2/5, AAV2/7 and AAV2/8. Recombinant AAV vectors were purified by ion-exchange chromatography (Serotypes 2/1, 2/2 and 2/5). O'Riordan et al. (2000) J Gene Med 2: 444-54 or CsCI centrifugation (serotypes 2/8 and 2/7) Rabinowitz et al. (2002) J. Urrol. 76:791-801.

[0108] Human ASM antibodies are human specific and do not cross react with mouse ASM. Coster (Corning, NY) 9018 plates coated (100 ul/well) with monoclonal recombinant human ASM (rhASM) antibody (2 ug/ml) diluted in 50 mM sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) were incubated overnight @ 2-8cC. Excess coating antibody was removed and blocking diluent (KPL, Inc., MD) was added for 1 h @ 37ยฐC. Plates were washed with a microplate washer (Molecular<br>

Devices, CA) for two cycles. Standards, controls and samples diluted in standard dilution buffer (PBS, 0.05% Tween, 1% HP-BSA) were pipetted in duplicate and allowed to incubate for 1 h @ 37ยฐC. Plates were washed as described above. One hundred microliters of biotinylated recombinant human ASM (rhASM) antibody (diluted 1:20K in standard dilution buffer) was added to each well, allowed to incubate for 1 h @ 37ยฐC, and then removed with a microplate washer. Streptavidin - HRP (Pierce Biotechnology, Inc., IL) diluted 1:1 OK was then added (100 ul/well) and allowed to incubate for 30 min at room temperature. Plates were washed as described above and then incubated with SureBlue TMB (KPL, Inc., MD) for 15 minutes @ 36-38ยฐC. The reaction was stopped with stop solution (KPL, Inc., MD) and absorbance values were then read at 450 nm with a Spectra Max 340 plate reader (Molecular Devices, CA). Data analysis was completed using Softmax Pro 4.3 software (Molecular Devices, CA).<br>
[0109] The protein concentration for each sample was determined with a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Inc., IL) using bovine serum albumin as standard.<br>
[0110] Mice were transcardially perfused with fixative containing 2% paraformaldehyde, 0.03% glutaraldehyde, 0.002% CaCI2 in 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer at pH 6.5, followed by perfusion with the same fixative at pH 8.5. Mouse brains and spinal cords were dissected and post-fixed overnight at 4ยฐ C in pH 8.5 fixative without glutaraldehyde. The tissues were washed in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, embedded in 3.5% agar and cut into 50 urn sagittal sections with a vibratome.<br>
[0111] Brains and spinal cords were vibratome-sectioned sagittally at 50 urn intervals. Sections were processed for immunofluoresence with primary antibodies against human ASM (1:200). Sections were incubated in 10% donkey serum, 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 hour, followed by incubation with biotinylated mouse anti-human ASM in 2% donkey serum, 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 72 hours. After washing, the signal was amplified using a Tyramide Signal Amplification kit (PerkinElmer, Boston MA). Human ASM protein was<br>

[0112] Filipin Complex (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was first diluted in 100% methanol for a stock concentration of 1 mg/ml. Stock solution is stable for 4 weeks at -20ยฐ C. After washing with PBS, the sections were incubated in the dark for three hours in a freshly made 10 ug/mi filipin solution in PBS. Sections were then washed three times with PBS. Cholesterol deposits were visualized under an ultraviolet filter on a fluorescence microscope.<br>
[0113] Brains were processed for immunofluorescence using primary antibodies directed against the calcium binding protein, calbindin. Sections were washed with potassium phosphate buffer (KPB) and then rinsed with potassium phosphate buffered saline (KPBS). Sections were then blocked in 5% donkey serum, 0.25% Triton X-100 in KPBS for up to 3 hours and then incubated in 5% donkey serum, 0.2% Triton X-100 and mouse anti-calbindin (1:2500, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in KPBS. After 72 hours at 4ยฐ C sections were rinsed with KPBS with 0.1% Triton X-100 three times. Secondary antibody, donkey-anti mouse CY3 (1:333, Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) was added in KPBS + 0.1% Triton X-100 for 90 minutes at room temperature. Sections were washed with KPB and then mounted onto gel-coated slides. Calbindin-positive cells were visualized under epifluorescence. In order to quantify Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, four full-faced, medial cerebellar sections were selected from each animal. Calbindin-immunopositive Purkinje cells were viewed under a fluorescent microscope and cell bodies were counted at a magnification of 20X. Each lobe was counted separately. Two separate focal planes were counted per lobe. Only cells in focus were counted to insure that no cell was counted twice.<br>
[0114] Fifty (50) urn vibratome sections were first processed for immunofluorescence with antibodies directed against human ASM, as described above. The sections were then washed in PBS and stained for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT; rabbit polyclonal, 1:500, Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) with the protocol outlined above for calbindin. Rather than using<br>

a CY3 secondary antibody, however, donkey-anti-rabbit FITC (1:200, Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) was used. The staining was first visualized under epifluorescence and later images were acquired with a confocal microscope.<br>
[0115] Filipin staining was quantified as follows. Exposure-matched images were captured using a Nikon E600 wide field upright epifluorescence microscope equipped with a SPOT digital camera. The AAV2/1- ร-gal group was imaged first, and that exposure was used to acquire all additional images. Each image analyzed represents a medial sagittal plane through the length of each half-brain. Morphometric analysis was performed with Metamorph software (Universal Imaging Corporation). The AAV2/1- ร-gal images were thresholded; once established, the same threshold was used in all images. The following regions were manually selected by the user and analyzed separately: cerebellum, pons, medulla, midbrain, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus and striatum. Integrated intensity was measured in each region, and all measurements (n= 3/group) from a given group of animals were used to generate averages. The reduction in cholesterol in the treated animals was then calculated as the percent decrease of the integrated intensity compared to the knockout ร-gal injected mice. Positive hASM immunostaining was observed throughout the cerebellum (Table 1), pons, medulla and spinal cord following unilateral injection of AAV-ASM within the deep cerebellar nuclei.<br>

[0117] Within the cerebellum mice treated with AAV2/1-ASM and had the most widespread (i.e., spread between lobules within the same sagittal section) level of hASM expression, whereas mice treated with AAV2/2-ASM had the most restricted level of Human ASM protein expression. Human ASM protein expression in mice treated with AAV2/5-ASM, AAV2/7-ASM, and AAV2/8-ASM was intermediate between these two groups. Medial - lateral spread between ' sagittal sections was maximal in mice treated with serotypes 1 &amp; 8 and minimal is mice injected with serotype 2. Serotypes 5 &amp; 7 initiated medial -lateral spread patterns intermediate between serotypes 1 and 2. Each layer of the cerebellum (i.e., molecular, Purkinje and granular) was transduced by each AAV serotype; however, an increased affinity for the molecular layer was apparent for all serotypes. Purkinje cell transduction was maximal in mice treated with serotypes 1 and 5. Mice injected with serotype 7 had the fewest number of transduced Purkinje cells. Mice treated with serotype 8 also had few transduced Purkinje cells, but had less ASM expression within the granular layer when compared to serotypes 1, 2, 5 &amp; 7. Purkinje cells transduced with ASM appeared to have a healthy cytostructure. Quantitative analysis of AAV mediated hASM protein expression by ELISA in cerebellar tissue homogenates supports these immunohistochemical findings. Mice injected with serotypes 1 and 8<br>

[0120] As previously demonstrated by (Passini et al. (2003) in "Society for Neuroscience" New Orleans, LA), filipin clearance also occurred in areas anatomically connected with the injection site, but that did not stain positively for hASM. MetaMorph analysis indicated that a reduction in filipin staining occurred throughout the entire rostral caudal axis. In the cerebellum and brainstem filipin was maximally reduced in mice treated with AAV2/1-ASM and AAV2/8-ASM, whereas in the diencephalon and cerebral cortex mice injected with AAV2/8-ASM had the best overall level of filipin clearance (Table 2). Nevertheless, these results indicate that the level of hASM required to correct cholesterol storage pathology is the ASMKO mouse CNS is minimal (i.e., below the hASM immunoflourescence limit of detection).<br>
[0121] Histological studies indicate that the ASMKO mouse cerebellum undergoes rapid deterioration. More specifically, Purkinje cells progressively die off between 8 and 20 weeks of age (Sarna et al. (2001) Eur. J. Neurosci. 13:1813-1880 and Stewart et al. (2002) in "Society for Neuroscience" Orland, FL). Calbindin is a widely accepted Purkinje cell maker. Positive calbindin<br>

WO 2006/119341	PCT/US2006/016943<br>
staining in AAV-ASM treated mice would suggest that AAV mediated expression of hASM is therapeutic. Overall our results indicate that AAV mediated hASM expression in the cerebellum prevents Purkinje cell death in the ASMKO mouse (Table 3). As expected Purkinje cell survival did not occur in lobules l-lll; mice were injected at 7 weeks of age and by 8 weeks the majority of these cells have already died off. Purkinje cell survival in lobules IVA/was maximal in mice treated with serotype 1. In lobule VI no significant Purkinje cell survival was observed in AAV treated mice. In lobule VII only mice treated with serotype 5 showed significant Purkinje cell survival. In lobule VIII again mice treated with serotype 5 as well as serotype 2 showed significant Purkinje cell survival. In lobules IX and X there were no significant differences between WT and KO mice (or between AAV treated mice) in Purkinje cell counts. This was expected, because at 14 weeks of age (i.e., age at sacrifice) Purkinje cells in these lobules are still viable in ASMKO mice. Across all lobules Purkinje cell survival was maximal in mice treated with serotypes 1, 2, &amp; 5 and minimal in mice treated with serotypes 7 &amp; 8.<br>

[0124] One way to determine if AAV generated hASM is functionally active within the ASMKO CNS is to assess its influence on cholesterol storage pathology - a secondary metabolic defect of NPA disease. In all AAV treated mice (with exception to AAV2/1-(3gal) correction of cholesterol storage pathology overlapped with areas that were positive for hASM immunostaining indicating that each serotype vector is capable of generating a functional transgene product. As previously demonstrated, correction of abnormal cholesterol metabolism correction also occurred in areas anatomically connected with the injection site, but also in regions that did not stain positively for hASM, suggesting that the level hASM required for correction of cholesterol storage pathology is minimal. Consistent with these hASM histochemical and biochemical results, mice treated with serotypes 1 and 8 demonstrated a marked reduction in cholesterol storage pathology. Mice treated with serotypes 2, 5, &amp; 7 also showed a reduction in cholesterol storage pathology, but not to the same extent as mice treated with serotypes 1 &amp; 8.<br>
Therapeutically Relevant Model of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). [0125] Amytrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by a selective loss of motor neurons in the cortex, brain stem and spinal cord. Progression of the disease can lead to atrophy of limb, axial and respiratory muscles. Motor neuron cell death is accompanied by reactive gliosis, neurofilament abnormalities, and a significant loss of large myelinated fibers in the corticospinal tracts and ventral roots1"6. Although the etiology of ALS is poorly understood, accumulating evidence indicates that sporadic (SALS) and familial (FALS) ALS share many similar pathological features; thus, providing a hope that the study of either form will lead to a<br>
39<br><br>
WO 2006/119341	PCT/US2006/016943<br>
common treatment7. FALS accounts for approximately 10% of diagnosed cases, of which 20% are associated with dominantly inherited mutations in Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1)8. Transgenic mice that express the mutant human SOD1 protein (e.g., SOD1G93A mice) recapitulate many pathological features of ALS and are an available animal model to study ALS 9. For SALS, a myriad of pathological mechanisms have been implicated as the underlying cause, including glutamate induced excitotoxicity, toxin exposure, proteasome dysfunction, mitochondrial damage, neurofilament disorganization and loss of neurotrophic support1011.<br>
[0126] To date there is no effective therapy for the treatment of ALS. Neurotrophic factors such as insulin growth factor I (IGF-1) have been investigated extensively for their potential usefulness in the treatment of ALS. Intracranial delivery of viral vectors (that are capable of axonal transport) to regions of the CNS that are interconnected with brainstem and spinal motor neurons provides a means of administering potential therapeutics, such as IGF-1, to areas that would otherwise be difficult to target through prior art means.<br>
[0127] Without being limited as to theory, it is may be that these targeted regions will not necessarily need to have direct connections with motor neurons; that is, it may be sufficient for these targeted regions to have direct connections with cells (e.g., interneurons and astrocytes) that merely compose the motor neuron's cellular environment. This supposition is supported by studies in chimeric mice that are mixtures of normal and SOD1 mutant-expressing cells. These experiments showed that non-neuronal cells that did not express mutant SOD1 delayed degeneration and significantly extend survival of mutant-expressing motor neurons 13. Furthermore, additional experiments have demonstrated that cells that make up the cellular environment of a motor neuron (e.g., astrocytes and microglia) are important sources of neurotrophic factors, and damage to these cells (as occurs pathologically in ALS) has been suggested to be one of the underlying factors that contributes to motor neuron degeneration 11.<br>

WO 2006/119341	PCT/US2006/016943<br>
[0128] A region of the CNS that is likely to support the transport of a therapeutic viral vector and/or expressed protein to the cellular environment of motor neurons is the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) of the cerebellum. The DCN has extensive afferent and efferent connections both with the brainstem and spinal cord (see figure 1)14-19. Targeting the DCN in a mouse model of neurometabolic disease with viral vectors capable of axonal transport resulted in detection of transgene protein in both the brain stem and spinal cord 20. Interestingly transgene protein was detected in cells that were both positive and negative for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), a motor neuron marker.<br>
[0129] Overexpression of superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) gene mutations in mice and rats recapitulates the clinical and pathological characteristics of ALS in humans. Compounds active in retarding symptoms in this model have been shown to be predictive for clinical efficacy in patients with ALS, and therefore is a therapeutically relevant model of this disease. Such mouse models have been previously described in Tu et al. (1996) P.N.A.S. 93:3155-3160; Kaspar et al. (2003) Science 301:839-842; Roaul et al. (2005) Nat. Med. 11(4):423-428 and Ralph et al. (2005) Nat. Med. 11(4):429-433.<br>
[0130] The current experiments, therefore, sought to investigate the influence of bilateral DCN delivery of AAV-IGF-1 on disease progression in symptomatic (i.e., 90 day old) SOD1G93A mice. Specifically, the primary goals were to determine if delivery of AAV-IGF-1 resulted in (1) vector and/or protein delivery to the brainstem and spinal cord; (2) a reduction in neuropathology in the brainstem and spinal cord; (3) improvement in motor behavioral function; and (4) a significant extension of lifespan. The results indicate that injection of viral vectors to regions of the CNS that are interconnected with the brainstem and spinal cord is a viable approach for delivering potential therapeutic transgenes to the brainstem and spinal cord. Moreover, our results support the development of therapies that are designed to treat motor neuron degeneration through modification of their cellular environment.<br>

[0131] Two studies were performed in the G93A SOD1 (SOD1G93A mutant mouse, referred to here at the SOD1 mouse). This model closely mimics human ALS. There is progressive motor neuron degeneration with hindlimb motor deficits appearing around 90 days of age in the mouse. Death occurs around days 120-122. Each study had four treatment groups: 1) mice received AAV serotype 1 encoding for IGF-1 (AAV1-IGF-1); 2) mice received AAV serotype 1 encoding for green fluorescent protein (AAV1-GFP); 3) mice received AAV serotype 2 encoding for IGF-1 (AAV2-IGF-1); and 4)) mice received AAV serotype 2 encoding for green fluorescent protein (AAV2-GFP).<br>
[0132] Without being limited as to theory, IGF-1 is a therapeutic protein for the treatment of ALS due to its many actions at different levels of neuraxis (see Dore et al., Trends Neurosci, 1997, 20:326-331). In the brain: It is thought to reduce both neuronal and glial apoptosis, protect neurons against toxicity induced by iron, colchicine, calcium destabilizers, peroxides, and cytokines. It also is thought to modulate the release of neurotransmitters acetylcholine and glutamate. It is also thought to induce the expression of neurofilament, tublin, and myelin basic protein. In the spinal cord: IGF-1 is thought to modulate ChAT activity and attenuate loss of cholinergic phenotype, enhance motor neuron sprouting, increase myelination, inhibit demyelination, stimulate motor neuron proliferation and differentiation from precursor cells, and promote Schwann cell division, maturation, and growth. In the muscle: IGF-1 is thought to induce acetylcholine receptor cluster formation at the neuromuscular junction and increase neuromuscular function and muscle strength. In this experiment, the IGF-1 Ea form of the protein was utilized.<br>
[0133] Green fluorescent protein was utilized as a control protein, which also enabled the visualization of expression mediated by the injection of the AAV vectors.<br>
[0134] Ninety days after birth, SOD1 mice were injected bilaterally into the DCN with the AAV recombinant vectors. In one study, the dose was approximately 2.0 e10 gc/ml injected per site. Certain mice were sacrificed about 110 days after<br>
42<br><br>
WO 2006/119341	PCT/US2006/016943<br>
birth and their brain and spinal cord were analyzed for GFP staining, IGF-1 expression via immunohistochemistry, IGF-1 expression via ELISA, IGF-1 expression via RT-PCR, ChAT localization via immunohistochemistry, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression, motor neuron counts, functional testing (rocking and accelerating) on the rotarod as described above, grip strength of both the forelimb and hindlimb using a grip strength meter, and survival.<br>
[0135] A "death event" was entered when animals could no longer "right" themselves within 30 seconds after the animal was placed on its back, or animals were found dead by animal care technicians. "Death event" classification was performed by 2 individuals with the animal's group (GFP vs. IGF-1 being blinded) at time of assessment.<br>
[0136] GFP was detected in the brainstem and throughout each division of the spinal cord following bilateral delivery of a GFP expressing AAV vector to the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) (see Figures 13 and 14). Figure 22 shows GFP distribution within the mouse brain. In addition to the DCN, GFP positive staining was also observed in the olfactory bulbs, cerebral cortex, thalamus, brainstem, cerebellar cortex and spinal cord. All of these areas either receive projections from and/or send projections to the DCN. In addition, GFP positive fibers and/ or cells were observed in proximity to ChAT positive cells.<br>
[0137] IGF-1 mRNA was detected in the brainstem and in each division of the spinal cord in mice treated with AAV1-IGF-1 or AAV2-IGF-1 demonstrating that the vector underwent retrograde transport (see Figure 18). IGF-1 protein was detected in the brainstem and the spinal cord in mice treated with AAV1-IGF-1 or AAV2-IGF-1. A reduction in GFAP staining in the oromotor nuclei (for example, the motor trigeminal nucleus, facial nucleus, and hypoglossal nucleus) and in each division of the spinal cord was observed in mice treated with AAV1-IGF-1 or AAV2-IGF-1 (see Figures 15-17). GFAP is a marker of gliosis, which is a pathological hallmark of ALS. Delivery of AAV1-IGF-1 or AAV2-IGF1 led to significant functional improvement on the rotarod and grip strength tasks (see<br>
43<br><br>
WO 2006/119341	PCT/US2006/016943<br>
Figure 20). Delivery of AAV-IGF-1 AAV2-IGF1 also significantly extended the lifespan of the SOD1 mouse (see Figure 21 where median survival increased to 133.5 or 134 days in AAV-IGF-1 treated mice as compared to 121 or 120 days in AAV-GFP treated mice). Figure 19 illustrates that DCN delivery of AAV-IGF-1 promoted the survival of motor neurons. The difference between mice treated with AAV encoding for IGF-1 as compared to DCN delivery of AAV encoding for GFP is statistically significant to a p-value = 0.01 as indicated by the asterik.<br>
[0138] Regardless of serotype, AAV-IGF-1 treatment significantly promoted motor neuron survival, improved motor performance in both rotarod and grip strength tests, and significantly extended lifespan. IGF-1 expression was detected throughout the brainstem and spinal cord using PCR and ELISA.<br>
