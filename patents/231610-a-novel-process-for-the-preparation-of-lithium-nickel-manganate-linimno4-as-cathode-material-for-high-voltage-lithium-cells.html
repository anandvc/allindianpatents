				<td>The present invention relates to a novel process for the preparation of lithium nickel manganate (LiNiMnO4) as cathode material for high voltage lithium cells. The present invention more particularly relates to the preparation of lithium nickel manganate.<br>
(LiNiMnO4) a composite, which is very useful for high voltage lithium cells and can be prepared by chemical combustion method.<br>
The literature survey reveals the presence spinal LiMn2-xNioO4 as a solid state battery material for lithium cells of high voltage. Y.K. Sun etal has shown that this interesting compound can be synthesized in the lab by preparing solution of the soluble acetates of Li, Mn &amp; Ni with glycine. These solution was evaporated to dryness and was heated to 300°C initially and subsequently to 800°C for 10 hrs to obtain the desired composition of LiMn2.xNixO4 {Y K Sun, D W Kim &amp; Y M Choi, J Power Sources, 79(1999) 231].<br>
Another literature citation describes the preparation of this compound by heating a mixture any of lithium salts like Li2CO3 LiOH / LiNO3 with any of the manganese salts like MnO2 / MnCO3 and any of nickel salt like NiO / Ni(OH)2 / Ni(NO3)2 / NiCO2O4 of definite proportions. The optimum temperature for the synthesis is 850°C. [K.Amine, H.Tukamoto, H.Yasuda &amp; Y.Fujita, J.Electrochem, Soc., 143 (1996) 1607].<br>
In the above mentioned methods disadvantages are phase purity difficult to controlling of pH, requires Intermittent heating, Long time of heating, high temperature range 800-850°C.<br><br>
The objective of this invention is a novel process for the preparation of lithium nickel manganate (LiNiMnO4) as cathode material for high voltage lithium cells, which obviates the defects and drawbacks in other methods known in the literature.<br>
The main object of this invention is to formulate a new low temperature procedure for the synthesis of LiNiMnO4 cathode material for high voltage lithium cells.<br>
Further the object of this invention to ensure good cyclability of the lithium based compound and to replace cobalt based lithium salt in order to get better working efficiency and higher voltage when the cell is assembled.<br>
Still another objective is to use glycerol as a binding agent to make an uniform homogeneous mixture which allows uniform reaction to occur during heating and does not permit side reaction to occur.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to prepare LiNiMnO4 cathode material from nitrate source so as to reduce the temperature of formation of the compound.<br>
Accordingly the present invention relates to a novel process for the preparation of lithium nickel manganate (LiNiMnO4) as cathode material for high voltage lithium cells which comprises characterized in that heating a mixture of nitrates of lithium, manganese &amp; nickel in molar ratio 1:1:1 respectively with citric acid and glycerol mixture 1:4 molar ratio at a temperature of 200°C initially for 30 minutes to get dried mass, heating the said dried mass from 200 deg C to 650°C for 10 hours in order to get the final product LiNiMnO4.<br>
In the embodiment of this invention the temperature of the product preparation was in between 400°C to 650°C for 10 hours.<br><br>
In yet another embodiment of this invention the product obtained in lithium nickel manganate.<br>
Still in another embodiment of this invention glycerol is used as a binding agent. In another embodiment of this invention the molar ratio of the components used for the formation of the product (viz. lithium nickel manganate) is as follows Li: Ni: Mn :: 1 : 1 : 1.<br>
A novel method of preparing LiNiMnO4 was developed by dissolving nitrates of lithium, nickel and manganese of the appropriate composition ration in a solution of citric acid and glycerol mixture (1:4 molar ratio) at 90°C for 15 min. The resulting clear solution was further heated to 140°C to get a high viscous solution and this viscous solution was then heated to 180oC for getting a dried mass. This mass was then heated slowly from 200°C to 600°C for lOhrs in a furnace. A fine spinel product was left behind was then cooled gradually to room temperature and was then analyzed for purity and structure by x-ray. The product obtained by this method was found to be in a single phase of high purity.<br>
The novelty of the process $ lies in the use of binding agent.<br>
This is a low temperature process<br>
The product formed is of high purity substantiated by x-ray<br>
No partial reaction occurs<br>
Simplest of all the procedures known<br>
The starting materials used are the nitrates of Li, Ni and Mn which are not used in earlier<br>
processes.<br><br>

The powder was mixed with small quantities of glycerol and ground well in order to get a paste. The paste was heated initially slowly to 200°C &amp; subsequently heated strongly to 600°C for 10 hours.
