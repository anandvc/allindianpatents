TITLE<br>
GEAR TOOTH CHAMFERING AND ROUNDING MACHINE<br>
APPLICANT<br>
Premier Limited <br>
                    58, Nariman Bhavan<br>
Nariman Point Mumbai - 400 021<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
The present invention is directed to gear tooth chamfering and rounding machine and in particular to those machines which form chamfering and rounding to the gears already made by hobbing process utilizing tool having shape of end-mill cutter and pencil type cutter.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
In the chamfering process rotating generally end-mill shaped tools are brought into contact with a work piece generally for a gear already formed by hobbing process, which is stationary. Twin spindle head in which chamfering tools are mounted are driven by A.C induction motor. Two cutters remove the stock material, one from right flank of gear and one from left flank of gear.<br>
The cutter head is swiveled to the half of the required included angle per face. After completion of one tooth, work face mounted on work head slide moves backward. Work piece is then indexed by on tooth. This indexing is obtained by controlled movement through timing belt mechanism.<br>
After indexing by one tooth work piece brought forward rapidly and then in feed to the required depth, which results contact between work piece and chamfering tool.<br>
In rounding process, instead of twin spindle head single pencil cutter is directed mounted in cutter head spindle with tool holding adaptor. Rounding of tooth is achieved by interpolation of X, &amp; Z-axis. Interpolation on cutter movement (X-axis), work piece indexing (C-axis) and work piece linear movement (Z-axis). After completion of rounding one tooth, work piece slide moves backward and indexing by one tooth and brought forward for interpolation. This cycle repeats till all teeth on work piece are rounded.<br><br>
Over the years there are many approaches for chamfering and rounding of gears one vary common approach utilizes a linear slide for cutter head. The feed to the cutter is given by hydraulic for chamfering. In this mechanism work piece is stationary after indexing by one tooth. The chamfering tools are given feed to generate chamfer on tooth.<br>
Some of the chamfering machine uses to separate cutter heads, which removes the stock one from right flank of the gear and other from left flank of the gear. Individual cutter head has five manual controlled adjustments, which requires precise setting, and it was time consuming for setting.<br>
For rounding of gear tooth, rounding is obtained by coordinating the alternative movement of the cutter and rotary movement of work piece.<br>
The alternative movement of the cutter is obtained by rotation of cam, shaped in order to obtain radius or cusp rounding. A set of 4 cams allows working modulus from 1 to 16 inclusive.<br>
A regulation device allows changing modulus between minimum and maximum value of every cam.<br>
Work piece rotation is driven by 3 gears, which make the dividing system. The clamping of work piece and tool quick approach is driving by pneumatic equipment. Practical ness and quickness of setting the large choice of profiles offered by cams, and the possibility to work internal gears make the machine universal and suitable to work either small or big series.<br>
On prior art, gear chamfering machine work piece indexing is through indexing change gear and feed to the work head is by cam movement. The whole process  required   more  time  for  setting,   also  the  number  of  component<br><br>
assembled for machine are being a conventional machine. Some international publications such as JP2003251527, JP06238516, EP0522448, JP04013517, JP07016685, JP01246014 etc discloses different tooth formation and chamfer apparatuses for the gears. The dove tail type guide ways which are exposed to chips and swarf leading to deterioration as these slide way are located in a position which is very difficult to protect invention to provide a gear tooth chamfering and rounding machine of greatly simplified structure where stated drawbacks of a prior conventional machine are substantially eliminated.<br>

The work head moves upon linear motion guide ways positioned across the machine bed. The work head contains the work spindle and work drive mechanism for indexing/ rotating the work piece about its own longitudinal axis. The work head movement is controlled by A.C servo motor and for its positioning by precision ground ball screw. Drive to the ball screw is through coupling. The rapid travel rate for work head axis is more to reduce the auxiliary time during non-cutting period.<br>
The work piece indexing and rotation is controlled by AC servomotor through timing belt and pulley arrangement. The feed back system is used for AC servomotor is  built  in  encoder mounted  on  motor.     Work  piece  holding<br><br>
mechanism is by hydraulically operated cylinder. It is a double acting cylinder for clamping and de-clamping of work piece with a high pressure.<br>
