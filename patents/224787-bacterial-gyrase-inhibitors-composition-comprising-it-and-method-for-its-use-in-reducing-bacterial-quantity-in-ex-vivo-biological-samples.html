This application claims priority to US<br>
Provisional Patent Application 60/256,094 filed December 15, 2000 and US Provisional Patent Application 60/275,292 filed March 13, 2001, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention is in the field of medicinal chemistry and relates to compounds, and pharmaceutical compositions thereof, that inhibit bacterial gyrases. The compounds are useful as inhibitors of bacterial gyrase activity. The present invention also relates to methods for treating bacterial infections in mammals. The present invention also relates to methods for decreasing bacterial quantity in a biological sample.<br>
BACKGROUND ,,0F THE INVENTION<br>
Bacterial resistance to antibiotics has long been recognized, and it is today considered to be a serious worldwide health problem. As a result of. resistance, some bacterial infections are either difficult to treat with antibiotics or even untreatable. This problem has become especially serious with the recent development of multiple drug resistance in certain strains of bacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) , Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Enterococcus. The appearance of vancomycin resistant enterococcus was particularly alarming because vancomycin was formerly the<br>
only effective antibiotic for treating this infection, and had been considered for many infections to be the drug of "last resort". While many other drug-resistant bacteria do not cause life-threatening disease, such as enterococci, there is the fear that the genes which induce resistance might spread to more deadly organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, where methicillin resistance is already prevalent (De Clerq, et al., Current Opinion in Anti-infective Investigational Drugs, 1999, 1, 1; Levy, "The Challenge of Antibiotic Resistance", Scientific American, March, 1998).<br>
Another concern is how quickly antibiotic resistance can spread. For example, until the 1960's SP was universally sensitive to penicillin, and in 1987 only 0.02% of the SP strains in the U.S. were resistant. However, by 1995 it was reported that SP resistance to penicillin was about seven percent and as high as 30% in some parts of the U.S. (Lewis, FDA Consumer magazine (September, 1995); Gershman in The Medical Reporter, 1997).<br>
Hospitals, in particular, serve as centers for the formation and transmission of drug-resistant organisms. Infections occurring in hospitals, known as nosocomial infections, are becoming an increasingly serious problem. Of the two million Americans infected in hospitals each year, more than half of these infections resist at least one antibiotic. The Center for Disease Control reported that in 1992, over 13,000 hospital patients died of bacterial infections that were resistant to antibiotic treatment (Lewis, "The Rise of Antibiotic-Resistant Infections", FDA Consumer magazine, Sept, 1995).<br>
As a result of the need to combat drug-resistant bacteria and the increasing failure of the available drugs, there has been a resurgent interest in discovering new antibiotics. One attractive strategy for developing new antibiotics is to inhibit DNA gyrase, a bacterial enzyme necessary for DNA replication, and therefore, necessary for bacterial cell growth and division. Gyrase activity is also associated with events in DNA transcription, repair and recombination.<br>
Gyrase is one of the topoisotnerases, a group of enzymes which catalyze the interconversion of topological isomers of DNA (see generally, Kornberg and Baker, DNA Replication, 2d Ed., Chapter 12, 1992, W.H. Freeman and Co.; Drlica, Molecular Microbiology, 1992, 6, 425; Drlica and Zhao, Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews, 1997, 61, 377). Gyrase itself controls DNA supercoiling and relieves topological stress that occurs when the DNA strands of a parental duplex are untwisted during the replication process. Gyrase also catalyzes the conversion of relaxed, closed circular duplex DNA to a negatively superhelical form which is more favorable for recombination. The mechanism of the supercoiling reaction involves the wrapping of gyrase around a region of the DNA, double strand breaking in that region, passing a second region of the DNA through the break, and rejoining the broken strands. Such a cleavage mechanism is characteristic of a type II topoisomerase. The supercoiling reaction is driven by the binding of ATP to gyrase. The ATP is then hydrolyzed during the reaction. This ATP binding and subsequent hydrolysis cause conformational changes in the DNA-bound gyrase that are necessary for its activity. It has also been found that the level of DNA supercoiling (or relaxation) is<br>
. dependent on the ATP/ADP ratio. In the absence of ATP, gyrase is only capable of relaxing supercoiled DNA.<br>
Bacterial DNA gyrase is a 4 00 kilodalton protein tetramer consisting of two A (GyrA) and two B subunits (GyrB) . Binding, and cleavage of the. DNA is associated with GyrA, whereas ATP is bound and hydrolyzed by the GyrB protein. GyrB consists of an amino-terminal domain which has the ATPase activity, and a carboxy-terminal domain which interacts with GyrA and DNA. By contrast, eukaryotic type II topoisomerases are homodimers that can relax negative and positive supercoils, but cannot introduce negative supercoils. Ideally, an antibiotic based on the inhibition of bacterial DNA gyrase would be selective for this enzyme and be relatively inactive against the eukaryotic type II topoisomerases.<br>
The widely-used quinolone antibiotics inhibit bacterial DNA gyrase. Examples of the quinolones include the early compounds such as nalidixic acid and oxolinic acid, as well as the later, more potent fluoroquinolones such as norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and trovafloxacin. These compounds bind to GyrA and stabilize the cleaved complex, thus inhibiting overall gyrase function, leading to cell death. However, drug resistance has also been recognized as a problem for this class of compounds (WHO Report, "Use of Quinolones in Food Animals and Potential Impact on Human Health", 1998). With the quinolones, as with other classes of antibiotics, bacteria exposed to earlier compounds often quickly develop cross-resistance to more potent compounds in the same class.<br>
There are fewer known inhibitors that bind to GyrB. Examples include the coumarins, novobiocin and coumermycin Al, cyclothialidine, cinodine, and<br>
clerocidin. The coumarins have been shown to bind to GyrB very tightly. For example, novobiocin makes a network of hydrogen bonds with the protein and several hydrophobic contacts. While novobiocin and ATP do appear to bind within the ATP.binding site, there is minimal overlap in the bound orientation of the two compounds. The overlapping portions are the sugar unit of novobiocin and the ATP adenine (Maxwell, Trends in Microbiology, 1997, 5, 102) .<br>
For coumarin-resistant bacteria, the most<br>
prevalent point mutation is at a surface arginine residue that binds to the carbonyl of the coumarin ring (Argl36 in E. coli GyrB). While enzymes with this mutation show lower supercoiling and ATPase activity, they are also less sensitive to inhibition by coumarin drugs (Maxwell, Mol. Microbiol., 1993, 9, 681).<br>
Despite being potent inhibitors of gyrase supercoiling, the coumarins have not been widely used as antibiotics. They are generally not suitable due to their low permeability in bacteria, eukaryotic toxicity, and poor water solubility (Maxwell, Trends in Microbiology, 1997, 5, 102). It would be desirable to have a new, effective GyrB inhibitor that overcomes these drawbacks and, preferably, does not rely on binding to Argi36 for activity. Such an inhibitor would be an attractive antibiotic candidate, without a history of resistance problems that plague other classes of antibiotics.<br>
As bacterial resistance to antibiotics has become an important public health problem, there is a continuing need to develop newer and more potent antibiotics. More particularly, there is a need for antibiotics that represent a new class of compounds not<br>
previously used to treat bacterial infection. Such compounds would be particularly useful in treating nosocomial infections in hospitals where the formation and transmission of resistant bacteria are becoming increasingly prevalent..<br>

Example 11<br>
We have prepared other compounds of formula I by methods substantially simIIar to those described in the above Examples 1-6 and those illustrated in Schemes I-VI. The characterization data for these compounds is summarized in Table 3 below and includes mass spectral (as M+l) and 2H NMR data.<br>
2H NMR data is summarized in Table 3 below wherein "Y" designates 1H NMR data is avaIIable and was found to be consistant with structure. Compound numbers correspond to the compound numbers listed in Table 1.<br>
Example 12 Gyrase ATPase Assay<br>
The ATP hydrolysis activity of DNA gyrase was measured by coupling the production of ADP through pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase to the oxidation of NADH. This method has been described previously (Tamura and Gellert, 1990, J. Biol. Chem., 265, 21342).<br>
ATPase assays are carried out at 3 0°C in<br>
buffered solutions containing 100 mM TRIS pH 7.6, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 150 mM KCl. The coupling system contains (final concentrations) 2.5 mM phosphoenol pyruvate, 200 uM nicotinatnide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) , 1 mM DTT, 3 0 ug/ml pyruvate kinase, and 10 ug/ml lactate dehydrogenase. 40 nanomolar enzyme (374 kDa Gyr A2B2 subunit from Staphylococcus aureus) and a DMSO solution of the inhibitor to a final concentration of 4% are added and the reaction mixture is allowed to incubate for 10 minutes at 3 0°C. The reaction is then started by the addition of ATP to a final concentration of 0.9 mM and the rate of NADH disappearance at 34 0 nanometers is measured over the course of 10 minutes. The percent inhibition values are determined from rate versus<br>
concentration profiles and are reported as the average of duplicate values.<br>
Table 4 shows the results of the percent inhibition activity of selected compounds of this invention in the Gyrase inhibition assay at 10 µM concentration. The compound numbers correspond to the compound numbers in Table 1. Compounds having an activity designated as "A" provided a percent inhibition value below 50 percent; compounds having an activity designated as "B" provided a percent inhibition value between 50 and 75 percent; and compounds having an activity designated as "C" provided a percent inhibition value greater than 75 percent.<br>
Example 13 Susceptibility Testing in Liquid Media<br>
Compounds of this invention were also tested for antimicrobial activity by susceptibility testing in liquid media. Such assays were performed within the guidelines of the latest NCCLS document governing such<br>
practices: "M7-A5 Methods for dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria that Grow Aerobically; Approved Standard - Fifth Edition (2000)". Other publications such as "Antibiotics in Laboratory Medicine" (Edited by V. Lorian, Publishers.Williams and Wilkins, 1996) provide essential practical techniques in laboratory antibiotic testing. Essentially, several discrete bacterial colonies (3 to 7) from a freshly streaked plate were transferred to an appropriate rich broth medium such as MHB, supplemented where appropriate for the more fastidious organisms. This was grown overnight to high density followed by a 1 or 2-thousandfold dilution to give an inoculation density of between 5 x 10s and 5 x 106 CPU per mL. Alternatively, the freshly picked colonies can be incubated at 3 7°C for about 4 to 8 hrs until the culture equals or exceeds a turbidity of a 0.5 McFarland standard (approximately 1.5 x 108 cells per mL) and diluted to give the same CFU per mL as above. In a more convenient method, the inoculum was prepared using a commercially avaIIable mechanical device (the BBL PROMPT System) that involves touching five colonies directly with a wand, containing Crosshatch grooves at its bottom, followed by suspension of the bacteria in an appropriate volume of saline. Dilution to the appropriate inoculum cell density was made from this cell suspension. The broth used for testing consists of MHB supplemented with 50 mg per L of Ca2+ and 25 mg per L of Mg2+. Standard dilution panels of control antibiotics were made and stored as in the NCCLS standard M7-A5, the dilution range typically being in the 128 µg per mL to 0.015 p.g per mL (by 2-fold serial dilution) . The test compounds were dissolved and diluted fresh for experimentation on the same day; the same or simIIar<br>
ranges of concentration as above being used. The test compounds and controls were dispensed into a multiwell plate and test bacteria added such that the final inoculation was approximately 5 x 104 CFU per well and the final volume was 100 µL. The plates were incubated at<br>
3 5°C overnight (16 to 20 hr) and checked by eye for turbidity or quantitated with a multiwell plate reader. The endpoint minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) is the lowest concentration of drug at which the microorganism tested does not grow. Such determinations were also compared to the appropriate tables contained in the above two publications to ensure that the range of antibacterial activity is within the acceptable range for this standardized assay.<br>
Table 5 shows the results of the MIC assay for selected compounds of this invention. The compound numbers correspond to the compound numbers in Table 1. Compounds having an activity level designated as "A" provided an MIC of less than 10 µg/mL; compounds having an activity level designated as "B" provided an MIC of between 10 and 4 0 ng/mL; compounds having an activity level designated as "C" provided an MIC of greater than<br>
4 0 p.g/mL.<br>
