				<td>CONVEYOR DRIVE CONTROL SYSTEM<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[OOOl]	A drive control system for use in connection with a conveyor<br>
that can be used in a manufacturing operation, more specifically, a dynamic conveyor drive control system that employs a mathematical model to effectuate delivery of balanced power and speed control of a material handling system so as to inaximize efficiency of moving work material throughout a production facility.<br>
BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	It is well known to provide a conveyor to move material<br>
throughout a plant. In many instances, electric motors are utilized to drive a chain which in turn is routed throughout a manufacturing line or plant so as move a part (load) along a predetemhned path. The weight of the load(s) to be carried by a conveyor system are noraially predetermined and are factored into a foniiula for ascisrtaining the torque requirements for a given drive motor or set of drive motors that are required to move all anticipated loads at a given speed. Sensing devices such as limit switches or proximity switches are often used to monitor and effectuate the control of the movement of loads along the established conveyor path. The loads are typically supported and earned by an element of the conveyor mechanical system commonly called a "carrier".<br>
[0003]	A common type of conveyor system is a monoveyor which can<br>
transport a load or series of loads on carriers that are directly attached to the chain of the conveyor system. Another common type of chain conveyor is a "power &amp; free" system. As with the monoveyor systems, the primary moving element is a chain, however, in this case the chain is utilized to push detached carriers along the; path of the conveyor.   These detached<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
caiTiers are located in a separate "free rail". Mechanisms along the pathway of the conveyor allow the carrier to disengage, stop, and switch to different pathways of the conveyor system. The load in either of these sj'stems can be a work piece that needs to be delivered to various work stations in order for particular operations to be perfomied such as machining, and once machined, the work piece continues on the conveyor to the next station. Multi-drive systems are commonly used to deliver power and movement to tliese conveyors.<br>
[0004J	The problem however is that traditional multi- drive systems do<br>
not compensate well under all conditions for the changes in torque demand as loads advance along the conveyor line. This may cause the drive motor in any given zone along the conveyor line to operate inefficiently. For example, a drive motor at apaiticular zone that is temporarily carrying a substantial portion of the total load could be under performing by not producing sufficient torque output so as to move the work piece given the dynamic conditions of the conveyor line. By contrast, a different drive motor in ar.other zone that is temporarily carrying very little load cotild be over performing and producing too much torque output thus causing the conveyor chain and thus the cairiers and loads to advance along the conveyor line eiratically. This inconsistency amongst the zones can also cause undue stress on the components of the conveyor.<br>
[0005]	One method of determining the amount of torque required to be<br>
produced by a given motor or group of motors so as to properly advance a work piece on a. conveyor under all expected conditions is to use a mathematical model commonly refen^ed to as a chain pull calculation. Typically, a chain pull calculation is a static mathematical model that is utilized during the design phase of a chain conveyor. Once the pathway of the system is detennined and the speed and load requirements are established, a series of static chain pull calculations are completed. Each static calculation is carried out with conveyor loads shown at various potential positions on the system. These calculations are also used to determine the<br>
 <br>
<br>
optimal power delivery as well as location of the drive or drives along the path of the conveyor. When the mode! is utilized, drives are tj'pically located and sized such that motors of equal horsepower are placed along the chain path, hi essence, final placement and sizing of drives is based upon this mathematical model of the conveyor mechanical systenr and the limits imposed by the conveyor pathway that is determined in order to perfomi the work anticipated by tha,t design.<br>
[0006]	Presently, a number of control teclinologies are employed to<br>
allow multi-drive systems to perform the required work. All systems rely to some degree on motor "slip" to balance the relative torque demands during operation. Some systems utilize torque feedback techniques to adjust individual motor torque outputs, hi any case, the individual drive control systems "react" to the imposed load conditions. For this reason, chain conveyors are designed with the hmitations imposed by reactive drive systems in mind. With the cuixent available technologies employed, the longer the chain and the greater the quantity of drives utilized in a multi-drive system, the higher the likelihood of erratic performance. Therefore miulti-drive conveyors are avoided when possible. The present invention overcomes this problem.<br>
10007]	A recognized "mle of thumb" in the conveyor industry is to limit<br>
the total length of chain in any single continuous chain system to 2000 feet. This is primarily due to the stress imposed on the chain and mechanical guide components by the build up of "chain tension" that partially occurs as a result of the standard practice of maintaining a taut chain. This chain tension tends to increase, in general, as the length of the chain is increased. The chain is kept relatively taut to avoid mechanical jamming or binding and or erratic fluctuations in chain speed sometimes referred to as "surge" due to the effect of uncontrolled chain "telescoping" when proper chain tension is not maintained. Operational irregularities can result due to chain speed inconsistencies that can afl'ect both manual and automatic systems<br>
 <br>
<br>
interfacing v&gt;'ith the conveyor and in some cases caj-s present a safety hazard or cause negative quality impacts on product withm a plant or conveyor line.<br>
[0008]	Therefore, it would be desirable to provide a conveyor drive<br>
control system that overcomes the aforementioned problems. The preferred system should be dynamic and operable to constantly change performance output of every motoi- within the system, in view of the constantly changing loads on the S3'stem. It would also be desirable to provide a drive control system lliat improves the available technology such that torque demands on the drive system are anticipated and proactively met, speed requirements are maintained, and in addition, total continuous chain lenglh may be effectively increased well beyond the 2000 foot limitation so as to accommodate the total length of the work zone of the con^'eyor.<br>
[0009]	It would also be desirable to provide an improved drive control<br>
Si'stem for a multi-drive system that continuously senses the position and weight of a load or loads as they travel about the system, sends that information to a computer which in turn calculates torque requirements for each drive within the system, and then sends a corresponding signal back to a drive controller for producing the proper torque output for each drive within the materials handling system.<br>
[0010]	It would also be desirable to provide an improved drive control<br>
system that improves delivery of balanced power and sj)eed control throughout the multi-drive material handling system. It would also be beneficial to increase the work efficiency of these systems by reducing the amount and weight of the "return chain" of power &amp; fi-ee systems, extending the total work length of the chain, as well as a reduction in the total number of drives required to move all loads along the path of the conveyor system so as to provide cost savings.<br>
[0011]	It will be appreciated that the improved drive control system can<br>
be employed with many types of conveyo!"s where multiple motors are used to move one or<br>
<br>
more loads throughout a maniifecturing line.<br>
[0012]	One aspect of tlie present invention provides a drive control<br>
system for a conveyor comprising one or more variable speed motors for driving a conveyor device. A dyn.amic chain pull calculation program is operable to continuously calculate the torque requirements for each motor in the system. One or more sensors are employed that are operable to create a signal indicative of a load transiting a designated zone and, if required, additional data including the Vv'eight of such a load or loads, and send data to a PLC. The PLC then converts the data from each sensor and transmits a signal to a computer operating the dyivcxnk: chain pull calculation program. A computer is operable to process tlie signal from, the PLC using the dynamic chain pull calculation progi^am and in turn generates real time drive torque data for each motor. A motor controller is operable to control each variable speed motor within the system so that the proper torque is generated by each motor as is required for optimum perfonnance. The resulting drive control system is dynamic and continuously monitors torque requirements for each motor within the system given cunxnt load data so as to maximize efficiency of the conveyor.<br>
[0013]	Further areas of applicability of the present invention will<br>
become apparent from the detailed description provided herein. It should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating preferred embodiments of the present invention, are intended for purposes of illustration only, since various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this detailed description. It will be appreciated that the present invention can be utilized in a variety of conveyor systems, and where: it is desirable to efficiently transport-materials through a plant or facility.<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAV/INGS<br>
[0014]	Figure 1 illustrates a flow diagram for a conveyor drive control<br>
system;<br>
[0015)	Figure 2 is a plan view that schematically illustrates components<br>
of the drive control system; and<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0017]	A di'ive control system 10 is illustrated in Fig. 1 and includes a<br>
dyirainic chain pull calculation computer software program 12, and industrial computer 14, a PLC 16 with software 18, a plurality of drive controllers 20, 22 and 24, a plurality of drive motors 26, 28 and 30 and sensing devices 32. The drive control system 10 is integrated with a conveyor 34 which includes typical components for moving work pieces tliroughout an assembly line. It will be appreciated that the present drive control system 10 can be utilized wherever it is desired to dynamically control the movement of material fi"om place to place.<br>
[0018]	With continued reference to Fig. 1, an individual encoder 36 is<br>
placed in proximity to drive motors 26, 28 and 30 for counting and monitoring the links 38 that comprise a conveyor chain 40. The conveyor chain can be in excess of the 2,000 ft. limitation that is typically ascribed to chain conveyor applications. Through utilization of the encoders 36, the specific number of chain links between drive motors can be constantly monitored and such data processed by the PLC 16. The rotational angle of all encoders is continually measured by increments and is returned to the control system via signal 44. These signals are compared to incremental measurements coming from other drive related encoders witliin the control system.   The incoming incremental data is utilized to cause the control system to<br>
 <br>

respond in such a way as to adjust t]i&amp; relative speed of each drive so that the niuiiber of chain iinJcs within the defined zone belv/een drives remains constant. The synchronizing function of titis system in this manner will assure that some amount of induced slack chain is maintained between all drive points.<br>
{0019]	The PLC 16 includes software 18 for converting the data from<br>
the sensing devices 32. This data in turn is processed by the industrial computer 14 so as to identify all carriers or loads transiting various predefined zones as well as the weight characteristics of each carrier and load on the conveyor 34. The logic software program 18 also processes the encoder dala 44 tlmt is conveyed to the PLC 16. The encoder data 44 wotild include^ inter alia, the number of links counted as they exit the preceding zone and enter the succeeding zone of primary drive zone*.<br>
[0020]	It will be appreciated that (he PLC 16 itself can control the speed<br>
adjustments of the slave drive controllers 22 and 24 individually without the aid of the computer 14. Likewise, the present system could be configured to exclude the PLC 16 and instead have the computer 14 process and output the signals to thee controllers 20, 22 and 24. Torque output signal 46 traverses from the PLC 16 to the master controller 20. A second torque requirement output signal 48 comes from controller 16 and is delivered to a slave drive controller 22. A third torque output signal 50 is communicated from controllei 16 to another slave drive controller 24. It will be appreciated that the present drive control system 10, can include a plurality 52 of controllers, drive motors 54, and encoders 56 in communication with one another, as deemed necessary in order to make the conveyor system 34 operate properly. Thus, the control system 10 is flexible and can be adopted for application in large-scale conveyance situations employing conveyor lines well in excess of 2,000 feet. By contrast fewer controllers and motors can be used and the system 10 automatically adjusts for same,<br>
[0021]	The sensing devices 32 send signals 58 to the PLC 16.   The<br>
 <br>
Attorney Do jjan No. 66724-0003<br>
signals 58 caiyy data identifyiag the load transitions of a work piece on the conveyor 34, zone (ocation of a particular work piece on the conveyor 34, and other iirfonnation sucli as if a v,'orIc piece carriei' is running empty, etc.<br>
10022]	Once the progi-am 18 associated with the PLC converts the data<br>
indicative of work piece zone location and weight of the work piece, that new data is then conveyed 60 to the industrial computer 14. The d)Tiamic chain pull calculation program 12 then iritei-{7rets and processes that new data so as to ascertain actual load and position characteristics for each drive motor. That information in turn is tiien compared to the real time ciUTent speed and torque requirements of each individual drive motor 26, 28 and 30, in order to ascertain whether each is operating efficiently. In turn, signals 62 are generated fi-om the industrial computer 14, to the PLC 16 and its program 1S which in turn segments the signal 62 into its constituent parts, hi tuni, signals 46, 48 and 50 are then generated by the PLC 16, to their corresponding controller 20, 22 and 24, that is indicative of how each motor 26,28 and 30 should be performing. For example, it is found that slave motor 30 is lagging, which is when the torque output is not equal to the calculated torque demand, then PLC 16 would send a signal 50 to controller 24 that is indicative of the need to increase power to drive motor 30.<br>
[0023]	Thus, a dynamic drive cc^ntrol system 10 is operable so as to<br>
allov/ the overall system to dynamically adjust given current load characteristics on the conveyor system 34. Thi-ough the use of the dynamic chain pull calculation 12, constant infonnation is sent via sensing devices 32, through PLC 16, which continuously monitors and updates, the cun-ent performance characteristics of the conveyor system 34 to the computer 14. In turn, feedback infonnation via signal 62 automatically adjusts the performance of the motors 26, 28 and 30 to a desired level,<br>
[00241	With reference to figure 2, a schematic diagram is illustrated of<br>
the plan view of the novel conveyor system 10.  The system 10 is divided into tliree primary<br>
 <br>

zones 64, 70, and 74, the extent of v.'liich are defined, in part, by the drive assemblies 26, 28, and 30. Each primary zone consists of the cham path between the drive assemblies located at the head and tail of said zone. The drive assembly at the tail of any primary zone is by definition the head of the preceding zone. Tj^ically, the loads 66, 68, 72, and 76 represent a single load in progressive positions as the load traverses the conveyor system. Encoders 36 axe located at each drive assembly and may serve two functions. One function is to provide a speed feedbtick reference to the drive control system to mairitain programmed and synchi-onized speed among all active drives. A second function is to provide a means to count passing chain links at eacli drive assembly. This information is used by the control system to maintain constant link counts necessary to assure the calculated cbain slack in each succeeding primary zone. Within each zone, the system 10 via program 12 is programmed to include a target number of chain links for optimal performance. When the system 10 detennines that the preset target number of links are not the same as the actual number of links in a given zone, then the dynamic control system 10 is intelligent and will automatically adjust, via drive controllers 20, 22 and 24, the speed of the corresponding motors 26,28 and 30 so as to reconfigure the system so that the target number of links can be obtained so as to maximize optimal perfomiance. By doing so, the stress upon the links within each given zone, is minimized and chain tension is relieved which will increase conveyor chain life and gdlow for the application of increased chain lengths for all similar systems.<br>
[0025]	First primary zone 64 includes the portion of the conveyor<br>
between tirst drive assembly 26' and third drive assembly 30. Sensors 32 are located at the entry and exit of each primary zone 64, 70, and 74 and are also located at the entry and exit of all other secondary zones 84, 86, 88, 90, 92 and 94 for the purpose of tracking the loads while within each zone. First primary zone 64 is shown with the master drive 26, its encoder 36, and sensing devices 32, located at the extremities of the zone. As the load 66, enters Primary Zone<br>
 <br>
<br>
#1, its presence is detected by the first set of sensors 32 notif3'ing the PLC 16 that the load has entered the area of the chain path under the cop.trol of firs( drive assembly 26' and has exited the control zone of drive assembly number 36'. The load traisition is recognized by the computer 14 and the torque output of each drive is modified accordingly. As the same load 68, passes into the secondary zone 86 defined by the beginning of the inclined vertical bend 80, the industrial computer 14 recognizes that the load is now xaversing up the incline. The torque demand on the first drive assembly 26' is increased based upon the lift angle and weight of the load as is recognized through preprogramming into the computer 14 and thus die torque is further increased to com]3ensa.te for this demand. Note that the load vi'eight and incline angle are pre-detennined and calculated in the overall system chain pull calculation progi-ammed in the computer 14. It should also be noted that a plurality of secondary zones 84, 86, 88, 90, 92, and 94, within the primary drive .assembly zones may exist bounded by sensing devices to monitor general load locations within the specified zones as they traverse the conveyor system. In addition, it should be noted that a "load sensing" secondary zone may shift between the drive control purviews of succeeding primary drive zone controllers in some instances where overhauling load conditions exist (declines with drive assemblies upstream). For example, when a load is traversing down decline 78, it may be "held back" by the second drive assembly 28'. When there is no load on this decline 78, which is also secondary zone 92, this section of chain may be pulled by the third drive assembly 30' if conditions warrant.<br>
[0026]	A second primary zone 70 includes that portion of the conveyor<br>
system 34 having its own set of sensors 32, a third load position 72, slave motor 28 and an associated encoder 36. It will be appreciated that the sensors 32 can be of the proximity type or any other device that is commercially available and commonly used for these pmposes on material handling systems. Other types of sensors may be employed as desired.<br>
[0027]	A third zone 74 is provided and it describes a fourth load<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
position 76, sensors 32, and a slave drive motor 30 with its associated encoder 36, h will be appreciated that the conveyor system 34 can be broken dowai into as many zones as necessary to monitor and control the drive control system 10. The purpose of which is to provide segments of tiie conveyor system that employ its own motor and encoder which pj-ovides continuous feedback to the computing system of the drive control system 10. Such aiTangement allows the constiint monitoring of loads moving within and between secondary "load sensing" zones as well as monitoring the number of chain linlcs within each zone so as to optimize performance. The PLC 16 and industrial computer 14 are operable to process the signals from the encoders so as to compare the targeted prefen:ed number of chain links within a given zone, to the actual number of links within a given zone. In tum, the PLC 16 responds by adjusting the controllers 20, 22 and 24 respectively.<br>
[0028]	With reference to Fig. 3, a side elevation view of the sciiematic<br>
representation illustrating hovv' a workload traverses through a plant is depicted. For example, drive motor 26 propels a load 66 along a flat, continuous path mrtil it reaches an inclined vertical bend 80. When at position 68, the load is shown traveling up the incline 80, which generates increased torque demand on the conveyor system 34. In turn, drive motor 26 will automatically adjust to increase its torque output. This, in part, is done through the aid of a dynamic chain pull calculation program 12 wliich is capable of aiding the system in automatically adjusting to the overall system current torque needs.<br>
[0029]	Conversely, as the load 76 traverses back down a decline 78, the<br>
motors in the system will automatically adjust to accommodate same. It will be appreciated that the sensors 32 positioned around the conveyor hne will automatically sense load transitions into and out of primary zones and various other defined secondary zones within each drive zone positions and their associated weights, with said data being then directed via signal 58 to the PLC 16 as shown in Fig. 1,<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
[0030]	A description of ihe operation of the drive coiitroi system 10 H'ilj<br>
now be presented. With reference to Figs. 1 and 2, one aspect of the prefeired embodiment of the present invention includes one or more loads 66 being placed on a conveyor chain 40. It will be appreciated that the length of the chain can be in excess of 2,000 ft. because of the unique design herein. The conveyor system 34 can move a single load, or a plurality of loads througjiout tlie system, at any given time. As load 66 traverses within the first primary zone 64, the sensor 32 will automatically detect its position. The control system will recognize this condition as well as the load weight thus sending a signal 44 to the PLC 16. That data is processed by the logic program 18 which in tmir converts the information to a signal 60 which IS then delivered to the industrial computer 14. The dynamic chain pull calculation program 12 in turn processes the j-eal time signal 60 and majces a comparison to a preferred or bench mark performairce indicia x. A delta will now be recognized indicating the difference between the actual perfonnance and the prefeiied bench mark perfomiance x. The dynamic chain pull calculation program 12 processes this condition and automatically adjusts perfonnance of the system to make it closer to the bench mark perfonnance: level. This is accomplished by the industrial computer producing the signal 62 which is indicative of the drive torque requirements for the master drive motor 26, and for the other associated slave motors. The PLC 16 differentiates the signal 62 into select torque output requirements 46, 48 and 50 which in turn infomrs the controllers 20, 22 and 24 the desired tc)rque levels. Drive motors 26, 28 and 30 in turn receive signals 82 commensurate with the desired perfonnance automatically perfomred at the desired level. Thereafter, the drive motors impart motion to the drive chain 40 so that material advances throughout a plant in a smooth and consistent manner,<br>
[0031)	It will be appreciated that more than three controllers and motors<br>
can be slaved to the PLC 16. For example, a number up to "N" 52 can be integrated within the system and will allow for chain lengths of greater than 2,000 ft. It will also be appreciated that<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
each associated controller 52 will have its OH'II drive moto;- 54 and encoder 56 the combination of which become part of their own zone within the convevor 34,<br>
[0032]	Through this unique convej'or drive control system 10, the drive<br>
motors 28, 30, or 54 can be removed for maintenance, or other purposes, while in operation and when this condition is detected the other associated motors within the system 10, will automatically adjust under dynamic conditions and increase their performance as to accommodate for the missing motor. Further, the master drive motor 26 could be taken out of sendee and one of the slave drive motors 28, 30, etc., could be designated, either manually or automatically, as the new master drive. Likewise, the fbmier master drive 26 could be designated as a salve di'ive as desired when it is brought back into seiwice. Thus, the drive control system is flexible in that salve and master motors can be interchanged and the computer 14 or PLC 16 i^ay operate to control or effectuate said changes.<br>
[0033]	/uiother aspect of the operation of the present invention includes<br>
monitoring the number of chain links within a given zone as discussed above. This is accomplished by the associated encoders 36 counting the number of links 38 within the chain 40 as they traverse pass their associated motor. Prior to operation, the computer 14 will have been programmed to a predetermine desired number of links within each given zone. This creates the base line for which the computer to comparer whether or not the target number of links are appropriate within a given zone. As the system operates, the data produced by the chain and carrier movement vs'ill be delivered to the computer 14 which will recognize any discrepancy and automatically adjust the signal 62 back to the PLC 16. The associated controllers 20,22 and 24 will automatically adjust the speed of their associated drive motors so as to re-sync the system. The goal is to get back towards the target number of links within a given zone and produce a calculated level of slack chain. Such should reduce the stress on the links 38 within the chain 40 which in turn will increase longevity of the chain 40, This in tum<br>
 <br>
<br>
reduces operating costs and enliances efficiency. It should be noted that the calculated level of slack chain would be a minimal amount such that subsequent chain telescoping v/ould not cause the system to jam.<br>
[0034J	It should be noted that this invention is apphcable to conveyor<br>
systems with single drive control units which may be utilized to caiTy or deliver loads of vai'ious different weights at different time periods. This data (load weight) may be manually or automatically input as the carrier is loaded and the torque control will automatically adjust to the torque demand as required,<br>
[003S]	It is to be understood that the above description is intended to be<br>
illustrative and not limiting. Many embodiments will be apparent to those of skill in the art upon reading the above description. Therefore, the scope of the invention should be deteniiined, not with reference to the above description, but instead with reference to the appended claims, along with the full scope of equivalents; to which such claims are entitled.<br>
