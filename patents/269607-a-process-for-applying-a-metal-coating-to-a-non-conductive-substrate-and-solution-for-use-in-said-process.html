				<td>Process for applying a metal coating to a non-conductive substrate<br>
Field of the Disclosure<br>
The invention relates to a process for applying a metal coating to a non-<br>
conductive substrate and to a composition used in this process.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Various methods are known of coating non-conductive surfaces. In wet chemi-<br>
cal methods, the surfaces to be metallised are, after an appropriate preliminary<br>
treatment, either firstly catalysed and then metallised in an electroless manner<br>
and thereafter, if necessary, metallised electrolytically, or are directly electrolyti-<br>
cally metallised.<br>
Methods according to the first variant with electroless metallisation have, how-<br>
ever, proved disadvantageous, as process management of the electroless met-<br>
allising bath is difficult, treatment of the waste water from this bath is complex<br>
and expensive, and the process is lengthy and thus likewise expensive due to<br>
the low deposition speed of the metallising bath.<br>
Especially for metal coating of plastic parts, for example for sanitary fittings and<br>
for the automobile industry, and of parts which are used as casings for electrical<br>
appliances which are screened against electromagnetic radiation, the elec-<br>
troless metallising methods are problematic. In treatment of such moulded<br>
parts, generally relatively large volumes of the treatment solutions are carried<br>
over from one treatment bath into the next, as these have a shape by means of<br>
which the treatment solution is transported out of the baths when the parts are<br>
lifted out. As electroless metallising baths normally contain considerable quanti-<br>
ties of toxic formaldehyde and complex formers which are only removable with<br>
difficulty, in their treatment large quantities of these baths are lost and must be<br>
disposed of in a complicated manner.<br>
For this reason a series of metallising methods was developed, by means of<br>
which the non-conductive surfaces could be directly coated with metal without<br>
electroless metallisation (see, for example, EP 0 298 298 A2, US 4,919,768, EP<br>
0 320 601 A2, US 3,984,290, EP 0 456 982 A1 and WO 89/08375 A1).<br>
In EP 0 616 053 A1 there is disclosed a method for direct metallisation of non-<br>
conductive surfaces, in which the surfaces are firstly treated with a<br>
cleaner/conditioner solution, thereafter with an activator solution, for example a<br>
palladium colloidal solution, stabilised with tin compounds, and are then treated<br>
with a solution which contains compounds of a metal which is more noble than<br>
tin, as well as an alkali hydroxide and a complex former. Thereafter the surfaces<br>
can be treated in a solution containing a reducing agent, and can finally be elec-<br>
trolytically metallised.<br>
WO 96/29452 concerns a process for the selective or partial electrolytic metalli-<br>
sation of surfaces of substrates made from electrically non-conducting materials<br>
which for the purpose of the coating process are secured to plastic-coated hold-<br>
ing elements. The proposed process involves the following steps: a) preliminary<br>
treatment of the surfaces with an etching solution containing chromium (VI) ox-<br>
ide; followed immediately by b) treatment of the surfaces with a colloidal acidic<br>
solution of paNadium-/tin compounds, care being taken to prevent prior contact<br>
with adsorption-promoting solutions; c) treatment of the surfaces with a solution<br>
containing a soluble metal compound capable of being reduced by tin (II) com-<br>
pounds, an alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide, and a complex forming<br>
agent for the metal in a quantity sufficient at least to prevent precipitation of<br>
metal hydroxides; d) treatment of the surfaces with an electrolytic metallisation<br>
solution.<br>
The processes described in EP 0 616 053 A1 and WO 96/29452 are disadvan-<br>
tageous in that they require the use of a noble metal such as palladium which is<br>
a very expensive metal.<br>
Hence, it is the object underlying the present invention to provide a process re-<br>
quiring a reduced amount of a noble metal such as palladium to activate the<br>
surface of the non-conductive substrate to be metal-coated.<br>
Summary of the Disclosure<br>
This object is achieved by a process for applying a metal coating to a non-<br>
conductive substrate comprising the steps of<br>
(a) contacting the substrate with an activator comprising a noble metal/group<br>
IVA metal sol to obtain a treated substrate,<br>
(b) contacting said treated substrate with a composition comprising a solution<br>
of:<br>
(i) a Cu(ll), Ag, Au or Ni soluble metal salt or mixtures thereof,<br>
(ii) 0.05 to 5 mol/l of a group IA metal hydroxide and<br>
(iii) a complexing agent for an ion of the metal of said metal salt,<br>
wherein iminosuccinic acid or a derivative thereof is used as said complexing<br>
agent.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
It has been surprisingly found that the use of iminosuccinic acid or a derivative<br>
thereof makes it possible to substantially reduce the amount of noble metal<br>
such as palladium in the activator.<br>
Suitable iminosuccinic acid derivatives for use in the present invention include<br>
those having the formula (I) shown below:<br><br>
wherein R^ is selected from the group consisting of H, Na, K, NH4, Ca, Mg, Li<br>
and Fe,<br>
R2 is selected from the group consisting of<br><br>
-CH2-COOR1, -CH2-CH2-COOR1, -CH2-CH2-OH, -CH2-CHOH-CH3 and<br>
-CH2-CHOH-CH2OH, and<br>
R3 is selected from the group consisting of H, -CH2-COOR1, -CH2-CH2-COOR1,<br>
-CH2-CH2-OH, -CH2-CHOH-CH3 and -CH2-CHOH-CH2OH.<br>
The above mentioned compounds are described in DE 198 50 359 A1. WO<br>
00/26398 describes a method of producing compounds of formula (I) and their<br>
mixtures on the basis of carbohydrates by fermentation in the presence of mi-<br>
croorganisms.<br>
Preferably, the iminosuccinic acid derivative is the iminosuccinic acid sodium<br>
salt having the following structural formula:<br><br>
The non-conductive substrates to be coated according to the process of the<br>
present invention are not particularly limited. These substrates include plastic<br>
parts which are intensely structured, such for example as combs or articles de-<br>
signed with a substantial extension in the third dimension, e.g. coffee pots, tele-<br>
phone handsets, water pipe fittings, etc. However, also other non-conductive<br>
substrates such as ceramic substrates or other metal oxide non-conductive<br>
substrates can be coated according to the present invention. In addition, small<br>
surfaces such as through-hole walls of printed circuit boards can be coated.<br>
The substrate may then optionally be micro-etched with a chemical etchant,<br>
where the substrate comprises a non-conductive material having a metal layer<br>
on it such as a copper-clad substrate which is employed in the manufacture of<br>
circuit boards. An example of such a chemical etchant includes standard etch-<br>
ing agents containing a mixture of chromic and sulphuric acid. The micro-<br>
etching step is employed in order to prepare the metal layer such as the copper<br>
layer portion of the substrate for subsequent electroplating. Acid dips and water<br>
rinses may be included after etching.<br>
Prior to treating the substrate with an activator, it may be immersed in a com-<br>
mercial pre-dip containing NaCI, SnCl2 and HCI, the pH of which is below about<br>
0.5.<br>
The substrate then treated with an activator comprising a noble metal/Group<br>
IVA metal sol. Noble metals comprise Ag or Au or Group VIII noble metals in-<br>
cluding Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, Ir, Pt, or various mixtures of such noble metals. The<br>
preferred noble metals are the Group VIII noble metals and especially a metal<br>
comprising palladium.<br>
The activator of the present invention is prepared in such a fashion so that there<br>
is excess Group IVA metal compound reducing agent present, i.e., a<br>
stoichiometric excess of reducing agent (e.g., divalent tin) compared to the no-<br>
ble metal compound (e.g., divalent Pd) from which the activator is made. In this<br>
way the activator such as the Pd/Sn sol has residual divalent Sn that can func-<br>
tion as a reducing agent.<br>
The Group IVA metals that may be employed include, for example, Ge, Sn and<br>
Pb, or mixtures thereof Sn being preferred.<br>
The activator preferably will contain a stoichiometric excess of the Group IVA<br>
metal as compared to the noble metal. The Group IVA metal is substantially in<br>
its lowest oxidation state so that it will be available to reduce the more noble<br>
metal salts that are employed in forming the activator. Because it is also em-<br>
ployed in a stoichiometric excess based on the salts of the noble metal that are<br>
employed to form the activator, the excess of the Group IVA metal in combina-<br>
tion with the activator will also be substantially in its lowest oxidation state. The<br>
activator thus prepared with the excess of the Group IVA metal in its lowest oxi-<br>
dation state will also be available to reduce the Group IB or other more noble<br>
metal salts that are subsequently brought into contact with the activator, such<br>
as the salts of copper as described herein. The Group IVA metal is preferably<br>
employed as a salt, such as a halide and especially a chloride, but in any event,<br>
will be present in an amount so that the molar ratio of the Group IVA metal to<br>
the noble metal of the activator is from 4:1 to 95:1, especially 10:1 to 55:1 and<br>
preferably from 15:1 to 50:1. Some specific Group IVA metal salts that may be<br>
used in this regard comprise PbCI2, SnCI2 or a mixture of GeCI2 and GeCI4 dis-<br>
solved in dilute hydrochloric acid. The preferred Group IVA metal comprises tin<br>
and especially tin in the form of stannous chloride.<br>
The preparation of the activator is conventional and is disclosed in United<br>
States Patent No. 3,011,920 and United States Patent No. 3,682,671.<br>
The treated substrate, after the activator solution has been applied, is rinsed<br>
and then treated with the above mentioned composition comprising the Cu(ll),<br>
Ag, Au or Ni soluble metal salt, the group IA metal hydroxide and the iminosuc-<br>
cinic acid (derivative) as a complexing agent for the ions of the metal of the<br>
aforementioned metal salts, comprising Ag+, Ag2+, Au+, Au2+ and Ni2+ salts.<br>
Preferably, the metal salt is a Cu(ll) salt.<br>
Anywhere from 0.0002 to 0.2 mols/l and especially from 0.004 to 0.01 mols/l of<br>
the said metal salt may be employed in the bath where the solvent preferably<br>
comprises water.<br>
The bath includes a Group IA metal hydroxide in an amount from 0.05 to<br>
5 mol/l, preferably 1 to 3 mol/l and most preferred 1.5 to 2 mol/l. The Group IA<br>
metals in this regard comprise Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs or mixtures thereof, especially<br>
Li, Na, K and mixtures thereof and preferably a metal comprising Li.<br>
The composition used in the process for applying a metal coating to a non-<br>
conductive substrate further includes iminosuccinic acid or salt thereof or a de-<br>
rivative thereof according to formula (l) above as a complexing agent.<br>
The iminosuccinic acid sodium salt can form pentacoordinated complexes. The<br>
complex is formed via the nitrogen atom and all four carboxylic groups. Some<br>
complex formation constants for various metal ions are shown in the table be-<br>
low:<br><br>
The complexing agent is employed in an amount sufficient for the bath to form a<br>
thin, dense metal-rich catalytic film on the substrate with sufficient electrical<br>
conductivity for subsequent electroplating and at the same time produce rela-<br>
tively clean metal surfaces. In general, the complexing agent is used in an<br>
amount of 0.005 to 1 mol/l, preferably 0.01 to 0.3 mol/l and most preferably 0.03<br>
to 0.15 mol/l.<br>
In addition to the iminosuccinic acid or iminosuccinic acid derivative complexing<br>
agent further complexing agents may be used. These further complexing agents<br>
are used in general in an amount of 0.05 to 1.0mol/l and preferably 0.2 to<br>
0.5 mol/l. Suitable additional complexing agents include complexing agents se-<br>
lected from the group consisting of acetate, acetylacetone, citric acid, 1,2-<br>
diaminocyclohexane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid, dimethylglyoxime (50% diox-<br>
ane), 2,2'-dipyridyl, ethanolamine, ethylenediamine, ethylenediamine N.N.N'.N'-<br>
tetraacetic acid, glycine, N'-(2-hydroxyethyl)ethylenediamine-N,N,N,-triacetic<br>
acid, 8-hydroxy-2-methylquinoline (50% dioxane), 8-hydroxyquinoline-5-sulfonic<br>
acid, lactic acid, nitrilotriacetic acid, 1-nitroso-2-naphthol (75% dioxane), ox-<br>
alate, 1,10-phenanthroline, phthalic acid, piperidine, propylene-1,2-diamine,<br>
pyridine, pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid, 1-(2-pyridylazo)-2-naphthol (PAN), 4-(2-<br>
pyridylazo)resorcinal (PAR), pyrocatechol-3,5-disulfonate, 8-quinolinol, sali-<br>
cyclic acid, succinic acid, 5-sulfosalicyclic acid, tartaric acid, thioglycolic acid,<br>
thiourea, triethanoiamine, triethylenetetramine (trien), 1,1,1-trifluoro-3-2'-<br>
thenoylacetone (TTA).<br>
The preferred additional complexing agent for copper ions is an alkanolamine<br>
comprising for example monoethanolamine. Alkanolamines in addition to<br>
monoethanolamine that may be employed in this regard include the following<br>
lower alkanolamines: diethanolamine, triethanoiamine, monoisopropanolamine,<br>
diisopropanolamine, triisopropanolamine, mono-sec-butanolamine. di-sec-<br>
butanolamine, 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanediol, 2-amino-2-ethyl-1,3-propane-<br>
diol, 2-dimethylamino-2-rnethyl-1-propanol, tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane,<br>
and various mixtures of the alkanolamines.<br>
Other weak complexing agents can be used such as other amines, including<br>
aliphatic and cyclic, e.g., aromatic amines having up io 10 carbon atoms ali of<br>
which are described in Kirk-Othmer, Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology un-<br>
der "Amines". Additionally, mono and poly carboxylic acids having up to 8 car-<br>
bon atoms and their salts can be used and include amino acids. These acids<br>
are also defined in Kirk-Othmer, Id. under "Carboxylic Acids" and "Amino Acids".<br>
The preferred acids in this regard include gluconic acid, lactic acid, acetic acid<br>
and tartaric acid.<br>
The composition for use in the process according to the present invention may<br>
preferably be obtained from a kit-of-parts, said kit-of-parts comprising composi-<br>
tion (A) and (B) wherein composition (A) comprises:<br>
(A1) said iminosuccinic acid or a derivative thereof,<br>
(A2) said soluble metal salt<br>
and wherein composition (B) comprises:<br>
(B1) said group IA metal hydroxide.<br>
The use of two components (A) and (B) is advantageous in that component (A)<br>
comprises the essential compounds for use in the process according to the pre-<br>
sent invention, whereas component (B) is an alkaline solution adjusting the pH<br>
of the final composition. The use of such a separate alkaline solution makes it<br>
easier to control the alcalinity of the bath under operating conditions.<br>
The various anions of the above mentioned water-soluble metal salt include<br>
inorganic acid anions or mixtures thereof such as the halogen anions, i.e., F-,<br>
CI-, Br- or I-, CI- being especially preferred, sulfate or carbonate anions, lower<br>
molecular weight organic acid anions such as formate or acetate anions or sali-<br>
cylate anions and the like. Additionally, mixtures of the foregoing anions can be<br>
employed as well as salt-like anions such as CuCl22KCI.2H2O,<br>
CuCI22NaCI.2H2O and the various art known equivalents thereof.<br>
As mentioned above, the use of iminosuccinic acid or a derivative thereof<br>
makes it possible to substantially reduce the amount of noble metal such as<br>
palladium in the activator.<br>
According to the present invention, the activator comprises at least 10 mg/l of<br>
palladium as noble metal, preferably 30 - 50 mg/l.<br>
According to the prior art processes, such as described in EP-A-0 538 006 or<br>
EP-A-0 913 502, the activator requires a much higher concentration in the<br>
range of at least 200 mg/l, e.g. 250 mg/l palladium.<br>
After contacting with the activator, the substrates are treated with the composi-<br>
tion comprising a solution of the Cu(ll), Ag, Au or Ni soluble metal salts or mix-<br>
tures thereof, the group IA metal hydroxide and the iminosuccinic acid complex-<br>
ing agent, for example, about 10 minutes with the temperature above 60°C.<br>
Bath temperature may vary from 49°C to 82°C. Treatment time ranges from 4 to<br>
12 minutes or more which is typical for production purposes, however, may vary<br>
out of this range depending on the temperature and condition of the bath. The<br>
time used is actually the time necessary to provide the best metal coverage for<br>
the formation of the conductive film or to provide minimum required coverage.<br>
The conductive film is then electrolytically coated by methods well known in the<br>
art.<br>
Subsequent electroplating is best achieved if the coating is microetched in an<br>
acidic oxidising medium so that the adhesion and morphology of the electrolyti-<br>
cally applied metal coating (e.g. copper) is optimised. Microetching is effected<br>
by an acidic oxidising agent which is conventional in the art, however, it has<br>
been found that even short exposures (e.g. about one-half minute) to the micro-<br>
etch solution causes a loss in conductivity and if microetching is carried out over<br>
a period of time for about two minutes the coating loses substantially all of its<br>
conductivity which indicates it is most likely entirely removed from the substrate.<br>
Accordingly, after the substrate has been treated with the copper bath, for ex-<br>
ample, it is then preferably rinsed with water and subjected to a neutralisation<br>
and reducing bath to eliminate this problem. The neutralisation and reducing<br>
bath neutralises the residual alkali on the treated surfaces and also improves<br>
the resistance of the conductive film to oxidising chemical micro-etchants.<br>
The neutralisation and reducing steps may be conducted separately, i.e., in<br>
separate steps employing a first acid neutralisation bath and a second reducing<br>
bath.<br>
Reducing agents that may be employed in this regard are generally disclosed in<br>
United States Patent No. 4,005,051 and EP-A-0 616 053.<br>
The treated substrate may then be coated electrolytically with a further or a final<br>
metal coating. In other words, the application of the composition as described<br>
above to the substrates as defined herein comprises the first step (in a two-step<br>
process) for the application of a metal coating to a non-metallic substrate. In this<br>
first step, a coating is obtained on the surface of the substrate which signifi-<br>
cantly lowers the resistivity of the substrate as compared to the conductivity of<br>
the substrate prior to the application of the composition according to the present<br>
invention. Thus, the present invention is directed to a two-step process wherein<br>
the conductivity is increased initially by applying a very thin metal coating hav-<br>
ing a resistivity in the range of about 0.04 to 12 kO/cm and especially 0.8 to<br>
6 kO/cm.<br>
The present invention is further illustrated by the following examples.<br>
Example 1<br>
Two compositions (A) and (B) were prepared as shown below:<br>
Composition (A):<br>
(A1) according to Table 1 below,<br>
(A2) about 4.0% by weight CuSO4- 5H2O,<br>
(A3) according to Table 1 below,<br>
(A4) optionally about 0.01% by weight of a tenside,<br>
the remainder being water.<br>
Composition (B):<br>
(B1) 6.0% by weight sodium hydroxide,<br>
(B2) 9.0% by weight lithium hydroxide,<br>
the remainder being water.<br>
The pH of composition (A) was 4.1 and its density 1.2053 g/cm3. The pH of<br>
composition (B) was 13 and its density 1.12 g/cm3.<br>
90 ml/l of composition (A) and 300 ml/I of composition (B) were mixed to obtain<br>
a bath comprising the above mentioned components and ingredients.<br>
In total, four baths were prepared comprising the amounts of complexing agents<br>
as shown in Table 1 below.<br>
Plates made of ABS (Novodur P2MC) were treated with an etching solution<br>
containing chrome (VI) oxide for 10 minutes at a temperature of 70°C. After a<br>
rinsing treatment, chrome (VI) compounds adhering to the substrate surfaces<br>
were reduced to chrome (III) compounds by treating the substrate with a reduc-<br>
ing agent for one minute at room temperature.<br>
After a further rinsing treatment, the substrate was treated in a solution for three<br>
minutes at 40oC, the solution being composed as follows: Activator: Colloidal<br>
solution containing 40 mg/l palladium as palladium chloride (much less than<br>
conventionally used: 200 gm/l Pd), 35 g/l stannous chloride (18.5 g/l Sn) and<br>
350 ml/l hydrochloric acid with a pH of 1 or less for 4 minutes.<br>
After the activator treatment, the substrate was again rinsed.<br>
After the rinsing treatment, the substrate was immersed into the bath obtained<br>
from compositions (A) and (B) described above comprising the complexing<br>
agent in the amounts described in Table 1 below. Table 1 also lists the results<br>
of measurements relating to the amount of palladium, tin and copper adsorbed<br>
onto the surface of the substrate depending upon the amount of complexing<br>
agent used.<br>
The experiments further showed that the use of the iminosuccinic acid complex-<br>
ing agent made it possible to obtain fully metal-coated HBS plates at the palla-<br>
dium concentrations mentioned above.<br>
Further, a comparison between the solutions obtained by removing the metal<br>
coatings from the ABS surfaces shows that the surface that has been treated<br>
with the iminosuccinic acid complexing agent has a significantly higher copper<br>
concentration at a reduced palladium concentration in the activator as well as a<br>
lower tin concentration.<br>
Finally, a comparison between compositions with and without iminosuccinic acid<br>
complexing agent added shows that those substrate surfaces which have not<br>
been treated with the complexing agent have less copper so that a complete<br>
coating is not obtained.<br>
The results obtained in Example 1 are summarised in Table 1 below.<br>
Table 1: Results of adsorption measurements on surfaces obtained with activa-<br>
tor AKI (40 mg/l palladium)<br><br>
It is apparent from the experimental results described above that the use of the<br>
iminosuccinic acid complexing agent results in a significant higher deposition of<br>
copper metal on the substrate surface in the Cu-Link step. In this experiment<br>
the overall molar content of complexing agent is kept constant to better com-<br>
pare the results. The metallic copper is deposited by a redox reaction in ex-<br>
change of Sn:<br><br>
The oxidised Sn2+ ions are dissolved in the solution. Therefore, a increase<br>
deposition of Cu(0) results in a decreased amount of absorbed Sn(0), which<br>
also becomes apparent from Table 1.<br>
The process involving the use of this complexing agent can be carried out at a<br>
concentration as low as 40 to 50 mg/l of Pd in the activator. According to the<br>
prior art processes, a concentration of at least 150 mg/l Pd in the activator is<br>
required.<br>
The solution comprising the iminosuccinic acid complexing agent can be pre-<br>
pared more easily than the prior art complexing solutions and, finally, their long-<br>
term stability in respect of carbonate formation is increased.<br>
The higher amount of metallic Cu (0) absorbed on the substrate surface results<br>
in an excellent final metal coating deposited thereon. A treatment using baths 1<br>
and 3 shown in Table 1 in contrast does not result in a completely metallised<br>
surface of the non-conductive surface.<br>
Example 2<br>
The following experiment was performed to show the superior metallisation re-<br>
sults:<br>
The substrates treated with the baths listed in Table 1 were washed with water<br>
and then subjected to a subsequent copper electroplating step. A commercially<br>
available copper electroplating bath Cupracid® HT (Atotech Deutschland<br>
GmbH) was used, which contains 250 g/l copper sulfate, 50 g/l sulphuric acid,<br>
50 ppm chloride ions and a brightening agent.<br>
The electroplating operation was performed at a plating solution temperature of<br>
25°C and a current density of 3 A/dm2 for 15 min.<br>
Metallisation result:<br>
Bath 1: Poor: Incomplete coverage of the surface with copper<br>
Bath 2: Good: Complete coverage of the surface with copper<br>
Bath 3: Poor: Incomplete coverage of the surface with copper<br>
Bath 4: Good: Complete coverage of the surface with copper<br>
