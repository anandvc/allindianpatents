				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates an apparatus for the production of panels. Though the invention describes an apparatus for manufacture of construction panels such as aerated panels, such an apparatus can in-extended to other type of panels wherein the slurry is poured into multiple castings in pre-measured quantities.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
In the conventional method of manufacture of panels, facing sheets are located as side supports and chamber is formed. The slurry is prepared in a measured quantity separately arid then poured into the formed chamber to manufacture the panels.<br>
It is also known to prepare  the slurry  in a mixing tank  and  in substantial larger quantities and  transfer the slurry  to pre measurment tanks and feed to the panel chamber. In this system, when large number of panels are to be manufactured, it employs lot of time as each time pre-measuring tank is to be fed, signal to be taken for the level attained and emptying. This cycle is to be repeated.<br>
In the known process for manufacture of accreted panels, slurry is to be discharged into a panel chamber before aeration starts. A disadvantage of such a known process is that only small quantities of slurry can be prepared resulting in lower production rate. Further, in the conventional process, each panel chamber is to be brought nearer to the pre-measuring tank and then moved, which consumes more Lime and hampers mass production of panels.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
An   object   of   this   invention   is   to   propose   an   apparatus   for producing panels, which has a higher rate of production.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to propose an apparatus for producing panels which is<br>
automatic and hence the production of panels is cost effective.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to propose an apparatus for producing panels which provides a consistency in the size of the panels.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided an apparatus for the production of panels charactrised in that is:-<br>
a)	a distribution tank having a plurality of chambers, each of said<br>
chambers made in way to receive a slurry for formulation of the'<br>
panels;<br>
b)	a discharge valve with each of said chamber,<br>
c)	a flow discharge member disposed below of said discharge valves<br>
for receiving the slurry from the distribution tank,<br>
d)	a movable trolley assembly placed to be disposed below the said<br>
flow discharge member, said movable trolley assembly also having<br>
a plurality of chambers for receiving the slurry from said flow<br>
discharge member.<br>
In accordance with this invention, a prepared slurry is first fed into a distribution tank.<br><br>
The distribution tank has a plurality of separator plates disposed in a spaced relationship to each other and such as to define a plurality of chambers, a chamber being provided for storage of slurry required for each panel. The separator plates are connected in such a way to operate raising or lowering of said plates. In an initial operation, the separator plates are in a raised position and a prepared slurry is filled into said distribution tank. Once the filling operation is completed, the separator plates are lowered into the tank so as to define a plurality of chambers, a chamber being provided for storage of slurry required for manufacture of each panel.<br>
The distribution tank has a discharge valve disposed at the bo I lorn of each of said chambers. When the valves are actuated into an open status, the slurry from the chambers of the distribution tank flow into a slurry discharge member. The slurry discharge system comprises a flexible pipe connected to each of the discharge valves of the distribution tank at the upper end. The lower end of said pipes is connected to its respective slurry<br>
discharge nozzle. The slurry discharge nozzles are connected to any known means for causing a raising and lowering of said nozzles.<br>
The trolley assembly is disposed below the slurry discharge nozzles and slurry discharge nozzles are made to move down into the chambers of the panels mounted on trolley assembly which ensures that slurry is discharged into the chamber without any spillage.<br>
Once the slurry is discharged into the compartments i.e. chambers of the panels mounted on the trolley, the discharge nozzles are retrieved back, the top extrusions inserted on each of the chamber and trolley assembly moved to be next station. Meanwhile a next ' trolley assembly is disposed below slurry discharge nozzles and the process repeats.<br>
After preset period, top extrusion, side frames are removed, panel separated. The extrusions and supports are cleaned arid made ready for next trolley assembly and the process repeats.<br>
DESCRIPTION  0f  INVENTION  WITH  REFERENCE  TO DRAWINGS<br>
Futher objects and advantages of this invention will be more apparent from the ensuing description when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and wherein;<br>
Fig. 1     shows  the  apparatus  for  simultaneous production  of  multiple  panels,<br>
Fig.2      shows  a  side  view of  a  distribution tank,<br>
Fig.3     shows  a  plan  view of  a  distribution tank, and<br>
Fig.4      shows  a  movable  trolley with assembled chambers adapted  to be moved below the distribution tank<br>
Referring to Fig.l, the apparatus 1 for simultaneous production of multiple panels comprises a distribution tank 20 to feed slurry into assembly mounted on a movable trolley 40 through a flow discharge member 30. Thus slurry is poured into distribution tank 20 having a plurality of compartments 21 and such that the number of compartments 21 correspond to the number of panels to be formed.<br>
The slurry from compartments 21 flow into a flow discharge member 30 comprising discharge pipes or tubes 31 corresponding to the number of compartments 21. Thus, a tube 31 is provided for each compartment. The apparatus 1 further comrprises a movable trolley 40 having chambers 41 corresponding to the number of compartments 21 and tubes 31. As would be apparent from Fig.l, each chamber 41 has its respective tube 31 and compartment 21 so that a plurality of panels can be formed simultaneously.<br>
Reference is now made . to Figs. 2 and 3 which illustrates the distribution tank 20 having a plurality of compartments 21. Compartments 21 are formed by separator plates 22 disposed in a spaced and paralled relationship and such as to define said compartments. Actuating means are provided for raising and lowermrig off peases 222, saadd means comprising a bracket 23 at either end of tank 20, said bracket having a connecting link 24.<br>
One end of connecting link 24 is connected through a pin joint 25 to a hydraulic jack 26. Any known motive source (not shown) imparts a movement to hydraulic jack 26 for causing a movement to separator plates 22 and such as to allow a raising or lowering of said plates. In operation, plates 22 are raised and the slurry is fed into distribution tank 2O. Upon completion of feeding of slurry in tank plates 22 are lowered so as to form distinct compartments 21 to correspond to each panel.<br>
Figs. 2 and 3 show the means for raising and lowering of separator plates 22, such means are only illustrative in nature as any other raising and lowering means may be provided therefor.<br>
Each   of  compartment  21 has  a  discharge valve   27   for   facilitating  a  discharge   of the  slurry  therefrom and  into  discharge flow   means 30.  Reference  is  made  to  Fig. 1 which   illustrates the  discharge   means  to  comprise  a   plurality   of flexible  tubes  31, and  such that  each   tube  31  is connected   at  the   upper   end   to  its   respective<br>
discharge  valve 27.  A discharge  slurry  nozzle  32 is connected  to the?  opposite  end  of each of  pipes 31.<br>
Nozzles 32 regulates the discharge of slurry into trolley assembly 40. Trolley assembly 40 comprises a trolley platform 42 mounted on rotatable wheels 43 having an axle 44. A plurality of dividing frames 45 are mounted on platform 42 and in a spaced relationship to each other so as to define compartments 41 corresponding to those provided in distribution tank 20. Facing sheets 46 are disposed along the inner wall surface of dividing frames 45. A fixed clamp 47 and a movable clamp 48 is mounted on platform 42, a clamping screw 49 being provided with movable clamp 48. The clamping mechanism allows the compartments 41 to be held in position when the slurry aerates and creates a side thrust. The trolley assembly is moved below the injecting nozzles 32. In such a position, the injecting nozzles 32 move downwardly into the respective compartments 41 and discharge a<br><br><br>
predetermined quantity of slurry. Upon completion of the operation of discharge of slurry from distribution tank 10, valves 27 close and injecting nozzles 32 move upwardly and away from the compartments 41. The trolley 40 is now allowed to move to the next station and a top extrusion placed over each compartment 41 and the slurry allowed to aerate to form a panel in each compartment upon completion of the setting period, the top, bottom and side extrusions are removed, the panels are separated and subjected to the known step of curing.<br>
Several distinct advantages are derived by the apparatus of the present invention. One such advantage is that the process is continuous in nature. Yet another advantage is that a plurality of panels can be simultaneously produced.<br><br><br><br>
