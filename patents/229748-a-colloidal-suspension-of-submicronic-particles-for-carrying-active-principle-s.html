FLAMEL TECHNOLOGIES, Pare Club du Moulin a Vent, 33 avenue du Docteur G. Levy, F-69693 Cedex Venissieux, France,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
Retran05-12-  1;17:00   ;PLASSERAUD	!04 37 91  62 73        #  3/ 43<br>
WO 01/37809	PCT/FROO/02831<br>
COLLOIDAL SUSPENSION OF SUBMICRONIC PARTICLES AS VECTORS FOR ACTIVE PRINCIPLES AND METHOD FOR PREPARING<br>
SAME<br>
5  TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The field of the present invention is that of Vector Particles (PV), which are useful for the administration of active principles (PA). The latter are preferably medicaments  or nutrients  for  administration  to  an<br>
10 animal or human organism by the oral, nasal, vaginal, ocular, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intradermal, intraperitoneal, intracerebral or parenteral route, or the like. However, this may also involve cosmetic products or plant-production products,<br>
15  such  as  herbicides,  pesticides,  insecticides  or fungicides, or the like. In terms of chemical nature, the PAs most particularly,  but without limitation, involved in the invention are, for example, proteins, glycoproteins,       peptides,       polysaccharides,<br>
20 lipopolysaccharides, oligonucleotides, polynuclides and organic molecules.<br>
The present invention relates, more precisely, to colloidal suspensions of Vector Particles, advantageously  of  the  submicronic  type,  based  on<br>
25  polyamino acids (PAA). The present invention relates to both uncoated particles as such, and vector systems for PAs,  consisting of particles loaded with the PA(s) considered.  The present  invention  also  relates  to pulverulent solids comprising these PVs. The invention<br>
30 also relates to methods for preparing said colloidal suspensions of particles, with or without PAs.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
The encapsulation of PA into the PVs is intended in <br>
35 		particular to modify their duration of action and/or to convey them to the site of treatment and/or to increase the bioavailability of said PAs. Numerous encapsulation techniques have already been proposed. Such techniques are intended, on the one hand, to allow the transport<br><br>

- 2 -<br>
of the PA to its site of therapeutic action, while protecting it against attacks by the body (hydrolysis, enzymatic digestion and the like) and, on the other hand, to control the release of the PA at its site of <br>
5	action, in order to maintain the quantity available for the body at the desired level. The PAs involved in these vicissitudes of transport and of existence in the body are, for example, proteins, but may also be products which are completely, different, organic <br>
10  molecules of synthetic or natural origin.<br>
The review by M.J. HUMPHREY (Delivery system for peptide Drugs, published by S. DAVIS and L.ILLUM, Plenum Press, N.Y. 1986) reports the problem relating<br>
15  to the enhancement of the bioavailability of the PAs and the advantage of vector and controlled release systems.<br>
Among all the materials which can be envisaged for forming PVs, polymers are increasingly used because of<br>
20 their intrinsic properties. As regards the specifications which it is desired to obtain for the PVs, they are particularly demanding and comprise, in particular, the following specifications.<br>
1	The first specification desired for the PVs<br>
25           would be that the polymer constituting the<br>
	PVs is biocompatible, capable of being<br>
eliminated (by excretion) and/or<br>
biodegradable and, even better, that it is<br>
metabolized into products which are not toxic<br>
        30	for  the  body.  In  addition,  it  would be<br>
appropriate for the biodegradation in the body to be of a sufficiently short duration.<br>
2	It would be advantageous for the PVs to be<br>
able to  form a stable aqueous  suspension<br>
35	without the aid of an organic solvent and/or<br>
a surfactant.<br>
3	It would also be desirable for the PVs to<br>
have a sufficiently small size to be able to<br>
undergo,  in  suspension  in  a  liquid,  a<br><br>

sterilizing filtration by a filter whose pore diameter is less than or equal to 0.2 urn.<br>
4	It is desirable for the FVs and the PV-PA<br>
systems to be obtained by a method which is<br>
5	nondenaturing for the PA.<br>
5	The PVs advantageously ought to make it<br>
possible to control the rate of release of<br>
the PA.<br>
6	Another important specification would be that<br>
10	the PV-PA systems can constitute excellent<br>
injectable medicaments. This enhanced capacity for administration by injection -e.g. intravenous or intramuscular injection -"injectability" is characterized by:<br>
15	(i)  a reduced injected volume (for a given<br>
therapeutic dose) (ii) a low viscosity.<br>
These two properties are satisfied when the therapeutic dose of PA is associated with a<br>
20	minimal quantity of PA. In other words, the<br>
PVs should have a high PA load factor.<br>
7	The cost specific to the PVs in an injectable<br>
preparation should be reduced and, here<br>
again, it is appropriate for the PVs to have<br>
25	a high PA load factor. In the final analysis,<br>
the small size and a high load factor are major specifications sought for the PVs.<br>
8	It is also advantageous for the polymer<br>
constituting the PVs not to induce an immune<br>
30	response.<br>
The earlier technical proposals, which are described below, have tried to satisfy all these specifications. By way of illustration, there may be mentioned the <br>
35  earlier proposals (a) to (h):<br>
(a) Patent US-A-5 286 4 95 relates to a method of encapsulation by vaporization of proteins in aqueous phase, using materials having opposite    charges,    namely:    alginate<br><br>
Ret rar\05-1 2-     1;17:09	; PLASSERAUD	;04    37    91     62    73	#       6/    43<br>

(negatively   charged)    and   polylysine<br>
(positively   charged).   This   method   of<br>
manufacture makes  it possible to produce<br>
particles having a size greater than 35 jam.<br>
5       (b)  Moreover,  emulsion techniques are commonly<br>
used to prepare microparticles loaded with<br>
PA.   For   example,   patent   applications<br>
WO 91/06286,  WO 91/06287  and  WO 89/08449<br>
disclose such emulsion techniques in which<br>
10	organic  solvents  are  used  to  solubilize<br>
	polymers, for example, of the polylactic type.<br>
However, it was found that the solvents may<br>
be denaturing, in particular for peptide or<br>
polypeptide PAs.<br>
15 (c) Biocompatible PVs called proteinoids, which<br><br>
	have been described since 1970 by X. FOX and<br>
K. DOSE in "Molecular Evolution and the<br>
Origin of Life", Ed. Marcel DEKKER Inc<br>
(1977), are also known. Thus, patent<br>
         20	application WO 88/01213 proposes  a  system<br>
	based on a mixture of synthetic polypeptides,<br>
whose solubility depends on the pH. To obtain<br>
the matrix microparticles according to this<br>
invention, they solubilize the mixture of<br>
       25	polypeptides, and then with a change of pH,<br>
	they cause the precipitation of proteinoid<br>
particles. When the precipitation is carried<br>
out in the presence of a PA, the latter is<br>
encapsulated into the particle.<br>
 30   (d) There may also be mentioned, as a reminder,<br>
            patent US 4 351 337 which belongs to a field<br>
           which is different from that of the<br>
              vectorization of PA which is specific to the<br>
                invention. This patent discloses mass<br>
35	implants which are attached and located at<br>
quite precise sites in the body. These implants are hollow tubes or capsules of microscopic size (160 urn and having a length equal to 2 000 urn) , consisting of copolymers<br><br>
Retran05-i2- 1;17:09   ;PLASSERAUD<br><br>

	of copoly(amino acids) - e.g. poly(glutamic<br>
acid-leucine) or poly(benzyl glutamate-<br>
leucine) - which are obtained by<br>
copolymeri2ation of monomers of<br>
        5	N-carboxyanhydrides of amino acids (NCA). The<br>
	inclusion of a PA occurs through a technique<br>
for evaporation of solvent for a mixture of<br>
polymer and of PA. Patent US 4 450 150<br>
belongs to the. same family as patent<br>
       10	US 4 351 337  studied above and essentially<br>
has the same object. The constituent PAAs are poly(glutamic acid-ethyl glutamate).<br>
(e)	Patent   application   PCT/FR   WO 97/02810<br>
discloses a composition for the controlled<br>
15	release of active principles,  comprising a<br>
plurality  of  lamellar  particles  of  a biodegradable polymer,  which  is  at  least partially crystalline  (lactic acid polymer) and of a PA absorbed onto said particles. In<br>
20	this  case,  the  release  of  the  active<br>
principle occurs by desorption.<br>
(f)	The publication "CHEMISTRY LETTERS 1995, 707,<br>
AKIYOSHI ET AL" relates to the stabilization<br>
of insulin by supramolecular complexing with<br>
25	polysaccharides hydrophobized by grafting of<br>
cholesterol.<br>
(g)	The article which appeared in "MACROMOLECULES<br>
1997, 30, 4013-4017" describes copolymers<br>
composed of a polypeptide block based on<br>
30	L-phenylalanine,    (-benzyl-L-glutamate   or<br>
0-(tetra-O-acetl-D-glucopyranosyl)-L-serine, and a synthetic block, such as poly(2-methyl-2-oxazoline)  or  poly(2-phenyl-2-oxazoline). Polymers aggregate in aqueous medium to form<br>
35	particles of 400 nm,  which are capable of<br>
combining with an enzyme, lipase. The term combined means here that the protein adsorbs onto the particle by a physical phenomenon (no covalent bonding).<br><br>

(h)  Patent application FR 2 74 6 035 describes in<br>
particular,  page  28,  lines  3  to  16,  a<br>
colloidal   suspension  of  composite   gel<br>
microparticles,  obtained from a polyaminc<br>
5	acid of the polypolyleucine/sodium glutamate<br>
type, fractionated coconut oil (miglyol®) and deionized water or buffered saline solution (phosphate buffer pH 7.4 at 25°C) . The mean reference diameter D[4,3] of these composite<br>
10	gel microparticles is 2 800 nm. It is evident<br>
from all the examples of FR 2 74 6 035, that the smallest mean reference diameter D[4,3] is equal to 1 900 nm. Moreover, these composite gel microparticles<br>
.15	cannot   combine   with   insulin   in   the<br>
nondissolved state in colloidal suspension, according to a factor Ta&gt;7%. Under these conditions, it is obvious that the composite gel   microparticles   do   not  meet   the<br>
20	specifications,  and in particular not the<br>
specifications relating to injectability and to the  capacity  for  combination and  for release in relation to insulin. In  addition,  the  method  according  to<br>
25	FR 2 746 035 does not involve a nonaromatic<br>
polar solvent and the formation of microparticles does not occur spontaneously in aqueous medium, but involves the use of vigorous homogenization with the aid of a<br>
30	rotor/stator type device.<br>
(i) The subject of PCT application WO 96/29991 is polyamino acid particles useful for the vectorization of PA. These particles have a size of between 10 and 500 nm, preferably<br>
35	between 30 and 400 nm. In the examples of<br>
this PCT application, the size of the particles is measured by the radius of gyration. The radius of gyration of the particles obtained in these examples varies<br><br>
Retran05-12- 1;17:09  ;PLASSERAUD<br><br>

- 7 -<br>
	from 55 to 280 nm. Other techniques exist for<br>
measuring the size of colloidal particles.<br>
The determination of the mean hydrodynamic<br>
diameter (Dh) of the particles by quasi-<br>
        5	elastic light scattering (QELS) is an example<br>
of a convenient method of measurement. In the whole of the present disclosure, an Md procedure for measuring Dh is taken as reference. Md is described later. Thus, the<br>
10	Dh of the particles according to the examples<br>
of the PCT WO 9 6/29991 extends from 150 nm to 750 nm. It is to be noted that the PVs in question here consist of a hydrophobic core surrounded   by   hydrophilic   hair.   The<br>
15	hydrodynamic diameter of these objects is<br>
less than double their radius of gyration, as will be explained, for example, in the books "Dynamic Light Scattering", B.J. Berue and R. Pecaran (Wiley, 1976) and "Physicochemical<br>
20	Hydrodynamics", R.F. Probstein (Wiley 1994).<br>
The load factor Ta for the particles is conveniently expressed by the ratio of the mass of insulin to the mass of dry PV. According to the examples of WO 96/29991,<br>
25	with a PA consisting of insulin, is at best<br>
0.065 mg/mg, that is 6.5% by dry weight of insulin relative to the mass of PAA. Ta is measured according to a procedure Ma described later. The particles according to<br>
30	WO 96/29991 form spontaneously by bringing<br>
PAA into contact with an aqueous solution. The PAAs comprise neutral and hydrophobic amino acid monomers AAO and ionizable and hydrophilic monomers  AAI.  These  PAAs  are<br>
35	prepared by copolymerization of NCA of AAI<br>
precursors (e.g.: Glu-OMe) and of NCA of AAO<br>
(e.g. Leu) in solution in a dioxane/toluene<br>
mixture. The copoly(Glu-OMe) (Leu) obtained in<br>
solution is recovered by precipitation in<br><br>
Retran05-12- 1;17:09  ;PLASSERAUD<br><br>

water, filtration and drying. This copolymer<br>
is  then  subjected to  acid hydrolysis  by<br>
incorporating it into TriFluoroAcetic acid<br>
(TFA),  in which it dissolves. A copolymer<br>
5	Glu-O-Na)(Leu)    is    recovered    after<br>
neutralizing,   dialysis,   filtration   and<br>
freeze-drying. This coPAA is dispersed in an<br>
aqueous solution of NaCl and a suspension of<br>
nanoparticles   spontaneously   forms.   As<br>
10	indicated above, the latter have a Dh size<br>
greater than 150 nm and an insulin load<br>
factor Ta of 6.50%.<br>
It is therefore evident from the above that the earlier<br>
15 	technical proposals described above, and in particular proposal (i) , incompletely satisfy the new .specifications indicated above, and in particular a capacity for sterilizing by filtration, a high rate of degradation,   adaptability   to   constraints   for<br>
20 	administering medicaments by injection, low cost and high PA load factor.<br>
As regards the sterilizing filtration capacity, it is important that the PV particles are sufficiently small ~o pass,  in suspension in a liquid,  across filters<br>
25  whose cut-off is less than or equal to 0.2 um, without clogging.  Such  ease  and  efficiency  of  filtration sterilization   are   particularly   appreciated   for injectable medicaments. As regards the capacity for injection of the PVs, it is<br>
30 appropriate, for a given dose of PA, to be able to inject small volumes of liquid suspension, and that this suspension is not very viscous. This involves being able to reduce the quantities of excipient (PV) compared with the targeted therapeutic dose of PA and<br>
35  to provide PVs having a size which is as small as possible, while increasing, the loading capacity of PA. As   regards   the   specification   relating   to biodegradability of the PVs, the smaller the size of<br><br>

the PVs, the better it is and it allows their rapid elimination.<br>
In addition, it is appreciable to be able to reduce the quantities of excipient (PV) for economic reasons and <br>
5  	so as to enhance the tolerance of the injectable medicament.<br>
BRIEF DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Under these circumstances, an essential objective is to<br>
10  be able to provide novel PVs which spontaneously form, and without the aid of surfactants or of organic solvents, stable aqueous suspensions of PV. Another essential objective of the present invention is to provide novel PVs  in stable aqueous  colloidal<br>
15  suspension  or  in  pulverulent  form . and  based  on poly(amino acids)  (PAA),  these novel PVs having to satisfy as much as possible specifications 1 -o 8 of the abovementioned specifications. Another essential objective of the invention is to<br>
20  improve the particles disclosed in PCT application WO 96/29991.<br>
Another essential objective of the invention is to provide a novel suspension of PV whose characteristics are perfectly controlled, in particular in terms of PA<br>
25  load factor and in terms of control of kinetics of release of PA,<br>
Another essential objective of the invention is to. provide injectable medicinal suspensions. The specifications,   which   are   required   for   such<br>
30  suspensions, are a low volume for injection and a low viscosity. It is . important for the mass of colloidal particles per injection dose to be as low as possible, without limiting the quantity of active principle PA transported by these particles, so as not to damage the<br>
35  therapeutic efficacy.<br>
Another essential objective of the invention is to provide an aqueous colloidal suspension or a pulverulent solid comprising particles for carrying active  principles   satisfying  the   specifications<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION <br>
20  	The procedures Md and Ma for the Dh and Ta measurements are detailed below.<br>
Procedure Md:<br>
The pulverulent PAA powder is  suspended in a<br>
25      0.15 M aqueous sodium chloride solution at pH 7.4,<br>
25 °C and at a polymer concentration of between<br>
0.01  and  0.5 g/1  and,  preferably,  equal  to<br>
0.1 g/1. This suspension is stirred for 4 hours,<br>
and then introduced into the scattering cell of a<br>
30      light scattering apparatus,  of the Brookhaven<br>
type,  functioning with a laser beam having a<br>
wavelength of 488 nm and vertically polarized. The<br>
hydrodynamic  diameter  is  calculated  from  the<br>
electric field autocorrelation function by the<br>
35      cumulant method,  as  described  in the manual<br>

Procedure Ma:<br>
(a)	Preparation of an aqueous insulin solution:<br>
freeze-dried human recombinant insulin (Sigma<br>
No.  10259)  is  poured  into  a  0.1 N  HC1<br>
5	solution over 5 min at 25°C. This solution is<br>
	then poured into a phosphate buffer solution<br>
which is finally neutralized by adding 0.1 N<br>
NaOH. The solution is then allowed to stand<br>
for 30 min at room temperature, and then<br>
10	filtered on 0.8-0.2 μ acrodisc membrane. The<br>
mass of insulin is calculated according to the desired volume of solution, in order to obtain a concentration of 60 IU/ml.<br>
(b)	Dispersion of the vector particles in PAA to<br>
15           be combined in the insulin solution:  the<br>
		freeze-dried PVs are added to the insulin<br>
solution, in an amount of 10 mg PV/ml of<br>
solution. This mixture is stirred on a vortex<br>
two or three times, and then placed in <br>
        20	rocking shaker at room temperature for 18<br>
hours. The colloidal suspension is then stored at 4°C.<br>
(c)	Separation  of  free  insulin  from combined<br>
insulin  and  assay  of  free  insulin:  the<br>
2 5	solution containing zhe insulin and the PVs<br>
is centrifuged for 1 hour at 60 000 g at 20°C. The supernatant is placed in tubes provided with an ultrafiltration membrane (cut-off  100 000  Da)  and  centrifuged  at<br>
30	3 COO g, 2 hours at 20°C. The insulin in the<br>
filtrate is assayed by HPLC.<br>
One of the inventive bases of these novel vector particles PV, in stable aqueous colloidal suspension or <br>
35 	in the form of pulverulent solid, is due to the innovative selection of a group of polymers and of an innovative methodology which make it possible to obtain particles of submicronic size, which form a stable<br><br>

aqueous  colloidal  suspension  in  the  absence  of surfactants or solvents.<br>
Another inventive basis of these novel vector particles PV, in stable aqueous colloidal suspension or in the <br>
5 	 pulverulent solid state, is due to the innovative selection of a group of particular submicronic structured particles by their load factor Ta &gt; 7% and their size Da 
10 producing the particles. Indeed, the reduction in size and the increase in the loading capacity of the particles of polyamir.o acids was a priori not obvious. Thus, using the method for producing nanoparticles of polyamino acid taught in PCT application WO 96/29991,<br>
15  persons skilled in the art were not able to obtain, "to measure", particles which correspond to the new specifications, as defined above.<br>
Finally, it is by modifying the compositions of the polymers  and  the  operating  conditions  that  the<br>
20 inventors were able to isolate these structured particles of very small size which are based on PAA and which have, quite surprisingly and unexpectedly, a load capacity Ta for insulin which may be up to three tines higher  than  that  characteristic  of  the  particles<br>
25   according to WO 96/29991.<br>
 Advantageously,  the  suspension  according  to  the invention is characterized in that the submicronic particles  do not  acquire their cohesion  from the <br>
30  presence of the following three compounds: - I)    oil<br>
II)	aqueous phase<br>
III)	and  at  least  one  synthetic  non-crosslinked linear copolyamino acid comprising at<br>
35      least two different types of amino acid comonomer: hydrophilic AAI and hydrophobic AAO, unlike the suspension of microparticles according to patent application FR 2 746 035.<br><br>

The structure of the PAA polymers and the nature of the amino acids are chosen such that:<br>
•	the polymer chains are spontaneously<br>
structured  in  the  form  of  small-sized<br>
5	particles (PV),<br>
•	the particles form a stable colloidal<br>
suspension in water and in physiological<br>
medium,<br>
•	the PVs combine with proteins or other PAs in<br>
10	aqueous medium, by a spontaneous mechanism<br>
which is nondenaturing for the protein,<br>
•	the PVs release the PAs in physiological<br>
medium and, more precisely, in vivo; the<br>
kinetics of release depend on the nature of<br>
15	the PAA polymer which is the precursor for<br>
the PVs.<br>
Thus, by modifying the particular structure of the PAA, it is possible to control the phenomena for combining<br>
20  and releasing the PA from the kinetic and quantitative point of view.<br>
It is to the applicant's credit to have chosen, as constituent material of the PVs, a particular composition of polyamino acids which are amphiphilic<br>
25  and which therefore possess properties of the PVs in PAA, namely:<br>
•	possibility of spontaneously forming<br>
colloidal suspensions of PV which are<br>
compatible with the pH of the physiological<br>
30	media   encountered   in   the   therapeutic<br>
applications targeted,<br>
•	spontaneous combination of the PAs with PVs<br>
in the absence of another agent apart from<br>
water which serves as solvent for them and<br>
35	which,  in  the  case  of proteins,  is  not<br>
denaturing,<br>
•	possibility of releasing the PA from the PA-<br>
PV combination complex, under physiological<br>
conditions,    with   pharmacokinetic    and<br><br>

	pharmacodynamic  profiles,  which  make  it<br>
possible to envisage advantageous uses in the<br>
therapeutic field (PA vectorization),<br>
and which, moreover, have novel properties which are:<br>
        5	• filterability with a cut-off of less than or<br>
equal to 0.2 urn for sterilization purposes,<br>
•	improved biodegradability,<br>
•	optimized injection capacity.<br>
10   It was possible to obtain these new properties by virtue of the primary technical functions of the- PVs which are the small nanometric size and the high load factor. To define these PAAs a little further, it is possible<br>
15 to indicate that they can be of the alternating sequential, ordered (block) type or of . the random sequential, disordered type.<br>
Thus,  according to a  first embodiment of the  PVs according to the invention, the constituent .PAAs are of<br>
20 the "block" ' type and are characterized by an AAO/(AAI+AAO) molar ratio such that:<br>
•	10%<aao></aao>

Advantageously, the absolute length of each AAO block, expressed as number of AAO is such that:<br>
•	preferably, AAO &gt; 10,<br>

According to a second embodiment of the PVs according to the invention, the constituent PAAs are of the "random" type, that is to say are prepared by <br>
35 	simultaneous copolyinerization of AAI and AAO monomers, and the AAO/(AAO+AAI) molar ratio is such that:<br>
•	AAO/(AAO+AAI) &gt; 10%,<br>

According to a preferred characteristic of the invention, the constituent block or random PAAs of the particles have degrees of polymerization DP of between 30 and 600, preferably between 50 and 200, and still<br>
15  more preferably between 60 and 150.<br>
Advantageously, the constituent PAAs of the PV particles are "diblock" PAAs.<br>
The present invention relates, not only to suspensions 20  of uncoated particles, as defined above, but also to<br>
particles comprising at least one active principle PA.<br>
Preferably, the suspension according to the invention<br>
is aqueous and stable. These particles, loaded or not<br>
with PA, are advantageously in. dispersed form in a 25  liquid (suspension), preferably an aqueous liquid, but<br>
may also be in a pulverulent solid state, obtained from<br>

    Accordingly, the invention relates, apart from to a <br>
30	colloidal suspension (preferably aqueous suspension)    of PV, to a pulverulent solid comprising PVs and obtained from the suspension according to the invention. Another essential subject of the invention relates to the preparation of the selected particles (as described <br>

and in the form of a pulverulent solid. The method of preparation considered essentially consists in synthesizing precursor PAAs and in converting them to structured particles.<br><br>

The first step of the - method is based on known techniques of polymerization of anhydrides of N-carboxy-(-amino acids (NCA), described, for example, in<br>

aprotic copolymerization solvents, while avoiding any<br>
30 precipitation and the use of acid hydrolysis in the presence of water and of nonaromatic polar organic solvent, constitute novel and inventive modalities which lead to structured, discrete and submicronic particles with a high PA load capacity, and which form<br>
35  a stable colloidal suspension in aqueous medium. These particles are not at all comparable to a macroscopic agglomerated precipitate of the type mentioned above in relation to the earlier proposal (d).<br><br>

According to one variant, at the end of step 1, the<br>
copolymer poly(A00)(pAAI) obtained is precipitated -<br>
preferably  in  water  -  and  this  precipitate  is<br>
recovered. This variant corresponds to a batch mode for<br>

poly(AAO) (pAAI)  is  isolated  in  the  form  of  a<br>

In a known manner, the copolymerization takes place at 15  a temperature between 20 and 120 °C,. at atmospheric<br>
•pressure and in the presence of an amine-containing initiator, e.g.: NH3. Other experimental parameters, such as the concentration of NCA and/or polymer in the<br>
nonaromatic polar solvent (preferably NMP), and/or the 20  concentration or the nature of the protic cosolvent,<br>

10 The neutralization (step 3) is carried out in practice,   <br>
   for example, using sodium hydroxide.<br>
The salt formed after neutralization as well as che solvent are then removed by any appropriate physical<br>
15 separation treatment, for example by diafiltration (dialysis) (step 4) , filtration, pH modification, chromatography and the like.<br>
This gives an aqueous suspension of . structured particles which may be concentrated, for example, by<br>
20 distillation or any other suitable physical means: ultrafiltration, centrifugation.<br>
To separate, in step 6, the. particles from their liquid suspension medium, the aqueous phase is optionally removed, for example, by drying (e.g. in an oven) by<br>
25  freeze-drying or any other suitable physical means: ultrafiltration,  centrifugation.  A white pulverulent solid is recovered at the end of this step 6. According to one variant, the concentration step may be carried  out  by  a  chemical  treatment,  such  as  a<br>
30 reduction in the pH, which converts to an acid the hydrophilic part of the glutamate monomers, making them insoluble in water. These acidic PAA intermediates may be filtered, washed and dried. Said acidic intermediates nay be neutralized with a chemical base<br>

preparation of a colloidal suspension of submicronic particles and to a high load factor with the PAs. During this preparation of colloidal suspension, the amphiphilic PAAs poly(AAO)(AAI) of step 2 are placed in <br>
5 	an aqueous medium in which at least part of the AAIs is soluble and at least part of the AAOs is insoluble. The PAAs exist in the form of nanoparticles in this aqueous medium.<br>
An alternative for preparing the PV suspension <br>
10 	according to the invention consists in bringing the pulverulent solid, as described above and as product and by its method of production, into contact with a nonsolvent aqueous medium for the AAOs.<br>
15  To carry out the combination of one or more PAs with the particles, it is possible to use several methods in accordance with the invention. Nonlimiting examples of these methods are listed below. According to a first method, the combination of PA with<br>
   20  the particles is carried out by bringing a liquid phase<br>
(aqueous or otherwise) containing the PA into contact<br>
with the colloidal suspension of particles.<br>
According to a second method, the combination of the PA<br>
with the particles is carried out by bringing a PA in<br>
25  the  solid  state  into  contact  with  the  colloidal suspension of particles. The solid PA may be,  for example, in freeze-dried, precipitate or powdered form or the like. According to a third method, the pulverulent solid<br>
30  (PAA),  as  described above as product and by  its production characteristics,  is brought into contact with a liquid phase (aqueous or otherwise) containing the PA. According to a fourth method, the pulverulent solid, as<br>

In all these methods, the PA used may be in pure or preformulated form.<br>
 Given the . nanometric size of the particles, the <br>

EXAMPLES<br>
15  EXAMPLE 1 - Production, in aqueous stable colloidal suspension and in pulverulent solid form, of vector particles, from a block polyamino acid, poly(Leu/Glu) 40/80 diblock<br>
112.4 g of NCA-GluOMe (0.60 mol) and 4 49 g of N-methyl-<br>
20 2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) are introduced, with stirring, into a 1 liter reactor thermostated at 20°C. After dissolution, 21.38 g of a 0.34 M solution of ammonia in 1,4-dioxane (1.25 mol%/NCA) are added. The polymerization is monitored by measuring the carbon<br>
25  dioxide emitted into a gas bell jar and verified by disappearance of vibration bands characteristic of the NCAs at 1860 and 1790 cm-1. After 30 min, a solution of 47.17 g of NCA Leucine (0.30 mol) in 631 g of NMP is introduced. After 10 min of reaction, the temperature<br>
30  is increased to 60°C. The polymerization is monitored as above and is complete after 2 hours. The temperature of the reaction mixture obtained is increased to 80°C. 31.5 g of aqueous concentrated hydrochloric acid (35%, 12 M) are added, with mechanical stirring over 30 min,<br>
35  to 350 g of the reaction mixture obtained at the end of step 1. The reactor is then placed under reduced pressure regulated at 600 mBar for 6 hours. A mixture of 31.5 g of 35% hydrochloric acid and of 126 g of water is then added over 60 min, followed by a second<br><br>

phase of vacuum at 250 mBar for 18 hours. In this    example, the overall water/pure hydrochloric acid ratio is 7.6/1 by mass and the acidic aqueous phase/NMP ratio is 60/100 by mass. <br>
5  	The reaction mixture is then cooled to 50°C and then neutralized with aqueous sodium hydroxide (35% by mass). The NMP and the sodium chloride formed during the neutralization are removed by diafiltration against 20 volumes of Milli Q water, on a membrane with an MWCO<br>
10  of 1 000 Daltons (Pellicon II system, Millipore) . A stable  aqueous  colloidal  suspension  of  vector nanoparticles  is  thus  obtained.  The  suspension  of nanoparticles is finally freeze-dried. The contents of leucine motifs are determined by proton<br>
15  nuclear magnetic resonance (signals at 2.10., 2.22 and 2.58 ppm for 4H of Glu and at 0.85 ppm for 6H of Leu). The mean hydrodynamic diameter (Dh) is 70 nm (according to Md).<br>
20 EXAMPLE 2 - Combination of insulin with the nanoparticles of poly(Leu/Glu) 40/80<br>
   	 The procedure Ma is used. The concentration of free    <br>
 insulin, assayed by HPLC chromatography is equal to      <br>
 0.59 mg/ml and the combined insulin concentration equal <br>
25  	to 1.51 mg/ml is deduced therefrom. The load capacity   for a colloidal solution of 10 mg/ml reaches 1.51 mg/ml of insulin. Thus, the ratio of the mass of combined insulin to the bLE (Ta) mass is 15.1%.<br>

15 samples were kept at 4°C (± 2°C) while the other samples were maintained at laboratory temperature:25°C (±5°C). At given times, the samples are collected from the site of storage and equilibrated for 1 hour at room temperature before the analysis. The analytical methods<br>
20  are detailed, the results being presented in the form of two tables.<br>
1) Verification of the homogeneity of the colloidal solution:  Without  stirring the  suspension,  100  ul<br>
25 samples are collected thee times in order to represent the state of the solution at the top, in the middle and at. the bottom of the bottle. The refractive index of each sample is measured at 25 °C on an Abbe refractometer calibrated relative to pure water. Three<br>
30 readings are made for each sample and the three mean values are compared. Any variation in the concentration of the solution results in a difference in refractive index.<br>
