METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR ALLOCATING FREQUENCY<br>
RESOURCES BASED ON MULTIPLE FREQUENCY REUSE FACTORS<br>
IN CELLULAR COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a cellular communication system. More<br>
particularly, the present invention relates to a system and a method for allocating<br>
frequency resources based on multiple frequency reuse factors in a cellular<br>
communication system using an orthogonal frequency division multiple access<br>
(OFDMA) scheme.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
In general, in a cellular communication system, the same frequency<br>
resources can be used in two areas even when they are spaced apart from each<br>
other to achieve efficient and effective use of limited frequency resources. The<br>
concept of frequency reuse will be described with reference to FIG. 1, which is a<br>
schematic view illustrating the concept of frequency reuse in a conventional<br>
cellular communication system.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, frequency resource F1 used in a first cell 100 having<br>
a radius R can be used in a second cell 150 having a radius R, which is spaced<br>
from the first cell 100 by a distance D. This is called "frequency reuse".<br>
A frequency reuse factor K is obtained when the same frequency resource,<br>
that is, the same frequency band, is reused in K cell units. As the frequency reuse<br>
factor increases, a distance D between frequency reuse cells using the same<br>
frequency resource also increases. In addition, a wave is attenuated in proportion<br>
to a propagation distance, so that interference from using the same frequency<br>
resource is reduced as the frequency reuse factor is increased. The amount of<br>
frequencies available in one cell can be obtained by dividing the whole frequency<br>
band by the frequency reuse factor K, so efficiency of the whole system may is<br>
adversely affected as the frequency reuse factor increases.<br><br>
Frequency resource allocation according to the frequency reuse factor K<br>
will be described with reference to FIGS. 2A to 2F. FIG. 2A is a schematic view<br>
illustrating frequency resource allocation when the frequency reuse factor K is<br>
3( K = 3).Referring to FIG. 2A, if the frequency reuse factor K is 3,   of the<br>
whole frequency band is allocated to each of the three cells. FIG. 2B is a<br>
schematic view illustrating frequency resource allocation when the frequency<br>
reuse factor K is 4( K = 4) .As shown in FIG. 2B, if the frequency reuse factor K is<br>
4,   of the whole frequency band is allocated to each of the four cells.<br>
FIG 2C is a schematic view illustrating frequency resource allocation<br>
when the frequency reuse factor K is 7( K = 7). When the frequency reuse factor<br>
K is 7,   of the whole frequency band is allocated to each of the seven cells.<br>
FIG. 2D is a schematic view illustrating frequency resource allocation<br>
when the frequency reuse factor K is  In this case, , of the<br>
whole frequency band is allocated to each three cell unit of the total nine cells,<br>
respectively, so that the frequency reuse factor K is applied to each of nine<br>
cells.<br>
FIG. 2E is a schematic view illustrating frequency resource allocation<br>
when the frequency reuse factor K is  The whole frequency band<br>
is allocated to each three cell unit of the total twelve cells, so that the frequency<br>
reuse factor K is applied to each of twelve cells.<br>
FIG. 2F is a schematic view illustrating frequency resource allocation<br>
when the frequency reuse factor K is  As shown in FIG. 2F, if the<br>
frequency reuse factor K is of the whole frequency band is allocated to<br>
each three cell unit of the twenty-one cells so that the frequency reuse factor K<br>
  is applied to each of the twenty-one cells.<br>
In analog cellular communication system, a minimum signal to noise<br>
ratio (SNR) is required for making a wireless voice communication circuit. To<br><br>
satisfy the SNR, a minimum distance between cells is defined. The frequency<br>
reuse factor is also defined based on the SNR.<br>
In digital cellular communication system, a minimum SNR has various<br>
values depending on an error correction coding rate applied to the wireless circuit,<br>
modulation scheme, and transmission scheme. In particular, a code division<br>
multiple access (CDMA) communication system applies a frequency reuse factor<br>
of "1" to all cells by taking the minimum SNR, system capacity, and network<br>
design into consideration. Since the CDMA communication system applies the<br>
same frequency band to all cells, a code spreading/de-spreading process<br>
discriminates the cells from each other. In this manner, interference of adjacent<br>
cells is averaged so that data of a present service cell can be discriminated from<br>
data of other cells.<br>
The frequency reuse factor is an important factor in a radio packet<br>
cellular communication system using anorthogonal frequency division multiple<br>
access (OFDMA) scheme. As discussed above, if the frequency reuse factor K=l,<br>
system capacity improves and network design is easier. Hereinafter, a carrier to<br>
interference and noise ratio (CINR) of a downlink signal in a cellular<br>
communication system with the frequency reuse factor of 1 is described with<br>
reference to FIG. 3.<br>
FIG. 3 is a schematic view illustrating the CINR of a downlink in a<br>
cellular communication system employing the frequency reuse factor of 1. As<br>
shown in FIG. 3, in a cell center region 301 adjacent to a base station (BS),<br>
intensity of a downlink signal, that is, the CINR is not influenced by intensity of<br>
an interference signal having the same frequency band from adjacent cells, so a<br>
relatively high CINR is present. However, a cell boundary region 303 spaced<br>
from the BS is significantly influenced by the interference signal having the same<br>
frequency band from adjacent cells, so a relatively low CINR is present.<br>
When subscriber stations (SSs) are located in the cell boundary region<br>
303, if the cellular communication system provides a low error correction coding<br>
rate and a low modulation scheme, frequency efficiency of the SSs in the cell<br>
boundary region 303 may degrade even though the SSs can normally receive<br>
packet data from the BS.<br>
To solve the above problem, the frequency reuse factor K is set to K&gt;1.<br>
Even if the frequency reuse factor K is set to K&gt;1, the signal may be attenuated in<br>
proportion to the propagation distance of the wave, so the CINR of the downlink<br><br>
decreases in a direction of the cell boundary region 303. However, since the<br>
interference component is very small, the CINR of the downlink is relatively high<br>
if the frequency reuse factor K is set to K&gt;1 as compared with the CINR of the<br>
downlink when the frequency reuse factor is equal to 1. This will be described in<br>
detail with reference to FIG. 4.<br>
FIG. 4 is a graph illustrating the relationship between the CINR and a<br>
distance from the BS when a frequency reuse factor is 1 (K=l) and greater than 1<br>
(K&gt;1) are applied to the cellular communication system. As shown in FIG. 4, as<br>
the frequency reuse factor increases, frequency efficiency in the cell boundary<br>
region can improve. However, since each cell uses 1/K of the whole frequency<br>
band, capacity of the whole system is reduced as compared with that of the<br>
system employing the frequency reuse factor of 1.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be described with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following detailed description, a<br>
detailed description of known functions and configurations incorporated herein<br>
will be omitted when it may make the subject matter of the present invention<br>
unclear.<br>
FIG. 5 is a schematic view illustrating a frequency resource allocation<br>
operation based on multiple frequency reuse factors in an orthogonal frequency<br>
division multiple access (OFDMA) cellular communication system according to<br>
an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
As shown in FIG. 5 if a subscriber station(SS) is located in a cell center<br>
region 501 adjacent to a base station(BS), a carrier to interference and noise<br>
ratio(CINR) is relatively high, so the frequency reuse factor for the SS is 1. If the<br>
SS is located in a cell boundary region 503, the frequency reuse factor for the SS<br>
is greater than 1 (K&gt;1), preventing the CINR from being reduced. If the SS<br>
moves from the cell boundary region 503 to the cell center region 501, the<br>
allocated SS frequency resource changes from being greater than 1 (K&gt;1) to<br>
being equal to 1.<br>
In OFDMA cellular communication systems, frequency resource<br>
allocation is carried out in a sub-channel unit that includes at least one sub-carrier.<br>
Herein, a method for creating the sub-channel based on the multiple frequency<br>
reuse factors in the OFDMA cellular communication system according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention is described with reference to FIG. 6.<br>
FIG. 6 is a schematic view illustrating a procedure of creating the sub-<br>
channel based on multiple frequency reuse factors in the OFDMA cellular<br>
communication system according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br><br>
Referring to FIG. 6, if the OFDMA cellular communication system uses<br>
N sub-carriers, the N sub-carriers are divided into G groups. Each of the G groups<br>
consists of S sub-carriers, so that the following equation is satisfied:<br>
N = S × G.<br>
A first sub-channel is created by selecting one sub-carrier from each of<br>
the G groups. A second sub-channel is created by selecting one sub-carrier from<br>
each of the G groups, except for the sub-carrier allocated to the first sub-channel.<br>
The above procedure may be repeated until all sub-carriers of the G groups are<br>
allocated to the sub-channels. As a result, a set of S sub-channels is created.<br>
It is also possible to create a new set of S sub-channels having sub-<br>
carriers different from the above sub-carriers by varying the sub-carrier selection<br>
scheme. The number of sets of the S sub-channels including mutually different<br>
sub-carriers is (S!) . Herein, a combination of the sub-carriers forming the sub-<br>
channel will be referred to as a "sub-carrier combination".<br>
In the following description, a set of n sub-channels selected from<br>
among the (S!) sets of the S sub-channels is defined as An and an m sub-<br>
channel of the sub-channel set An is defined as  . Herein, n =[0, (S!) ], and m<br>
= [0, S-l]. S sub-channels forming the same sub-channel set An<br>
are orthogonal to each other. So, the sub-carriers forming each of the S sub-<br>
channels may not collide with each other.<br>
In addition, the sub-channels forming mutually<br>
different sets of the sub-channels are aligned without ensuring orthogonality<br>
therebetween. So, the sub-carriers forming mutually different sub-channels may<br>
collide with each other. In addition, C sub-channel sets An are selected from<br>
among the (S!)G sets of the S sub-channels. At this time, if a predetermined sub-<br>
channel is selected from each of the C sub-channel sets An&gt; respectively, the<br>
number of sub-carriers having the collision characteristics can be uniform. As a<br>
result, the total number of sub-carriers with collision characteristics between two<br>
sub-channel sets is proportional to the number of sub-channels. As a result, the<br>
sub-channel set is created by selecting sub-carriers from among the (S!) sets of<br>
the S sub-channels. The C sub-channel sets with mutually different sub-carrier<br>
combinations and sub-carriers representing uniform collision characteristics can<br>
be created through various schemes.<br>
Hereinafter, a method of managing the sub-channel with a frequency<br><br>
reuse factor of 1 in the OFDMA cellular communication system will be described.<br>
First, when frequency reuse factor equals 1, all sub-carriers in a<br>
predetermined cell of the OFDMA cellular communication system (all sub-<br>
channels) can be used in adjacent channels.<br>
If each cell uses a sub-channel set having the same sub-carrier<br>
combination, (that is, if each cell uses the same An), interference may occur<br>
variously in each sub-channel depending on the channel state thereof.<br>
Accordingly, when presently measured channel information is applied to a next<br>
time duration, it is impossible to predict the channel state.<br>
Hereinafter, a method of creating the sub-channel when the frequency<br>
reuse factor is 1 will be described with reference to FIGS. 7A and 7B.<br>
FIG. 7A is a schematic view illustrating a procedure of creating the sub-<br>
channel when the frequency reuse factor of 1 is applied in the OFDMA cellular<br>
communication system according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 7A, if the OFDMA cellular communication system uses<br>
N sub-carriers, C sub-channel sets An can be created from the N sub-carriers<br>
through various sub-carrier selection schemes. FIG. 7B is a schematic view<br>
illustrating a set of sub-carriers corresponding to FIG. 7A, allocated to cells<br>
forming the OFDMA cellular communication system according to an embodiment<br>
of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 7B, the C sub-channel sets An are allocated to the cells<br>
forming the OFDMA cellular communication system. Each sub-channel of the C<br>
sub-channel sets An is orthogonal to the other sub-channels in the same sub-<br>
channel set while representing the uniform collision characteristic with respect to<br>
the sub-channels of different sub-channel sets. Accordingly, if the C sub-channel<br>
sets An are allocated to each cell, the interference component from the adjacent<br>
cells can be averaged due to the uniform collision characteristics of the sub-<br>
carriers. So, if an amount of resource used in the adjacent cells is not changed,<br>
validity of channel state information measured in a predetermined time unit can<br>
be maintained. In this manner, the OFDMA cellular communication system can<br>
effectively manage the sub-channel based on the frequency reuse factor of 1.<br>
However, although the amount of inter-cell interference can be averaged,<br>
the CINR may be reduced from the interference components of adjacent cells. In<br>
particular, the CINR is significantly reduced in the cell boundary region.<br><br>
Error correction coding with very low rate and modulation schemes with<br>
lower modulation order can be applied to the SS located in the cell boundary<br>
region to ensure service coverage of the wireless cellular communication system.<br>
However, error correction coding with very low rate and modulation schemes<br>
with lower modulation order may degrade bandwidth efficiency, thereby<br>
significantly lowering the transmission rate for the SS located in the cell<br>
boundary region.<br>
Hereinafter, the average transmission rate of the SS and the average<br>
transmission rate according to the cell radius in the OFDMA cellular<br>
communication system based on a frequency reuse factor of 1 will be described<br>
with reference to Table 1. Values shown in Table 1 have been obtained through a<br>
simulation test using a round robin scheduling scheme, in which both the long-<br>
term fading and short term fading are taken into consideration for a channel<br>
environment. That is, the cell/sector is divided into a plurality of concentric<br>
circles, which do not overlap each other and have a predetermined region. Then,<br>
the average transmission rate of each SS allocated to each concentric circle is<br>
calculated. After that, the average transmission rate of each SS is calculated to<br>
obtain the average transmission rate for each radius (each concentric circle). In<br>
the table, the cell radius is normalized to the max cell radius.<br>
The average transmission rate for each radius can be defined as a function<br>
of the transmission rate of each SS with respect to the size of the cell region. The<br>
average transmission rates shown in Table 1 are average values of the<br>
transmission rates of the SSs allocated to the concentric circles, which are<br>
gradually lowered as the SSs move towards the boundary region of the cell or<br>
sector. For this reason, the average transmission rate corresponding to the circle<br>
having the largest size is lower than the average transmission rate in the vicinity<br>
of the center regionof the cell/sector due to the interference component of the<br>
adjacent cell/sector of the OFDMA cellular communication system employing<br>
the frequency reuse factor of 1.<br><br><br><br>
As described above, the OFDMA cellular communication system uses the<br>
frequency reuse factor K by taking the interference component from the adjacent<br>
cell/sector into consideration. So, the use of frequency resources exerting an<br>
influence upon the adjacent cell/sector are limited. For instance, the OFDMA<br>
cellular communication system with the frequency reuse factor K uses K<br>
frequency bands, each one being different from each other. Alternatively, the<br>
system logically divides the sub-carriers included in one frequency band into K<br>
sub-carrier groups.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the sub-carriers included in one<br>
frequency band are divided into K sub-carrier groups and the frequency reuse<br>
factor K is managed based on the K sub-carrier groups.<br>
Hereinafter, a procedure of creating the sub-channel in the OFDMA<br>
cellular communication system based on the frequency reuse factor K will be<br>
described with reference to FIGS. 8A and 8B.<br>
FIG. 8A is a schematic view illustrating the procedure of creating the sub-<br>
carrier in the OFDMA cellular communication system based on the frequency<br>
reuse factor of K according to an embodiment of the present invention. The sub-<br>
carriers formed in one frequency band are divided into K sub-carrier groups and<br>
the frequency reuse factor K is managed based on the K sub-carrier groups. In<br>
FIG. 8A, the frequency reuse factor is 3 (K=3).<br>
S sub-channels forming a predetermined sub-channel set An ares divided<br>
into three exclusive sub-channel groups defined as  . FIG. 8B is a<br>
schematic view illustrating a group of sub-carriers as shown in FIG. 8A allocated<br>
to sectors forming the cell of the OFDMA cellular communication .<br>
Referring to FIG. 8B, under the frequency reuse factor of 3, three sub-<br>
channel groups  are allocated to each sector of the cell. In an ideal<br>
case, inter-cell/sector interference rarely occurs so that the average transmission<br>
rate of the SS located in the boundary region of the cell or sector may increase.<br>
However, the resources allocated to each cell or sector is reduced to 1/3, so the<br>
capacity of the cell or sector is reduced.<br><br>
Hereinafter, the average transmission rate according to the cell radius in<br>
the OFDMA communication system based on the frequency reuse factors of 1 and<br>
3 will be described with reference to Table 2. Values shown in Table 2 have been<br>
obtained through a simulation test using a round robin scheduling scheme, in<br>
which both long-term fading and short term fading are taken into consideration<br>
for a channel environment. In the table, the cell radius is normalized to the max<br>
cell radius.<br><br>
As can be seen from Table 2, employing the frequency reuse factor of 3<br>
produces a superior transmission rate at the boundary region of the cell or sector<br>
and an inferior transmission rate at the cell center region adjacent to the BS as<br>
compared with the OFDMA cellular communication system employing the<br>
frequency reuse factor of 1. This results because the interference component from<br>
the adjacent cell or sector is reduced in the cell center region due to the long-term<br>
fading. In addition, since OFDMA cellular communication system employing the<br>
frequency reuse factor of 3 may use 1/3 of resource, system capacity is reduced as<br>
well.<br>
Hereinafter, a method of employing the frequency reuse factors 1 and K<br>
for improving bandwidth efficiency and system capacity of the OFDMA<br>
communication system according to an embodiment of the present invention will<br>
be described. As described above with reference to FIG. 5, relatively weak<br>
interference is applied to the SSs located in the cell center regionThe SSs located<br>
in the cell center region may operate based on the frequency reuse factor of 1. In<br>
contrast, the SSs located in the cell boundary region may operate with K&gt;1 to<br><br>
reduce the interference component applied to the SSs from the adjacent cell or<br>
sector. That is, if the OFDMA cellular communication system employs the<br>
frequency reuse factors 1 and K, the interference applied to the SSs from the<br>
adjacent cell/sector can be reduced in the boundary region of the cell/sector and<br>
system capacity can be improved in the cell center region.<br>
However, if the OFDMA cellular communication system employs the<br>
frequency reuse factors 1 and K without physically discriminating them, a<br>
relatively large interference component results. As a result, the CINR of the SS<br>
having the frequency reuse factor K may be reduced and performance thereof will<br>
be significantly degraded. To solve the above problem, orthogonality is ensured<br>
between frequency resources having mutually different frequency reuse factors.<br>
Hereinafter, a method of allocating frequency resources based on multiple<br>
frequency reuse factors according to first and second embodiments of the present<br>
invention will be described. According to the first embodiment of the present<br>
invention, different frequency reuse factors are applied to mutually different time<br>
domains.<br>
According to the second embodiment of the present invention, different<br>
frequency reuse factors are applied to mutually different frequency resources.<br>
First, the method of allocating frequency resource in the OFDMA cellular<br>
communication system based on multiple frequency reuse factors according to the<br>
first embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to FIG.<br>
9.<br>
FIG. 9 is a schematic view illustrating frequency resource allocation<br>
based on multiple frequency reuse factors in the OFDMA cellular communication<br>
system according to the first embodiment of the present invention.<br>
As shown in FIG. 9, according to the frequency resource allocation<br>
scheme of the present embodiment, a predetermined time. domain, that is, one<br>
frame 900 is divided into a field 903 employing a frequency reuse factor of 1 and<br>
a field 905 employing the frequency reuse factor K in the time domain. In the<br>
field 903 employing the frequency reuse factor of 1, all cells/sectors of the<br>
OFDMA cellular communication system use mutually different sub-channel sets<br>
in such a manner that all cells/sectors can be managed with the frequency reuse<br>
factor of 1.In the field 905 employing the frequency reuse factor of K, each<br>
cell/sector uses the same sub-channel set in such a manner that the cell/sector can<br><br>
be managed with the frequency reuse factor of K. In particular, the different sub-<br>
channel sets are divided into K exclusive groups such that one of them can be<br>
used.<br>
Hereinafter, a procedure of allocating frequency resources based on<br>
multiple frequency reuse factors in the OFDMA cellular communication system<br>
according to a second embodiment of the present invention will be described with<br>
reference to FIG. 10.<br>
FIG. 10 is a schematic view illustrating the procedure of allocating<br>
frequency resource based on multiple frequency reuse factors in the OFDMA<br>
cellular communication system according to a second embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 10, if the OFDMA cellular communication system uses<br>
N sub-carriers, the N sub-carriers are divided into G groups. Herein, each of the G<br>
groups consists of S sub-carriers, so that the following equation is satisfied:<br>
N = S × G.<br>
In addition, each of the G groups is divided into two sub-groups and the<br>
sub-groups include S1 sub-carriers and S2 sub-carriers.<br>
First, a first sub-channel is created by selecting one sub-carrier from each<br>
of the G sub-groups. A second sub-channel is created by selecting one sub-carrier<br>
from each of the G sub-groups except for the sub-carrier allocated to the first sub-<br>
channel. The above procedure may be repeated until all sub-carriers of the G sub-<br>
groups are allocated to the sub-channels. As a result, a set of S1 sub-channels are<br>
created. In addition, as mentioned above, it is also possible to create a new set An<br>
of C sub-channels having sub-carriers different from the above sub-carriers by<br>
varying the sub-carrier selection scheme. The sub-channels of the new set An are<br>
orthogonal to each other in the same sub-channel set while representing the<br>
uniform collision characteristics with respect to sub-channels in the other sub-<br>
channel set. The sub-channel set An is allocated to each cell/sector so that the<br>
cell/sector can be managed with a frequency reuse factor of 1.<br>
Next, a first sub-channel is created by selecting one sub-carrier from each<br>
of the G sub-groups including Sk sub-carriers. A second sub-channel is created by<br>
selecting one sub-carrier from each of the G sub-groups except for the sub-carrier<br>
allocated to the first sub-channel. The above procedure may be repeated until all<br>
sub-carriers of the G sub-groups are allocated to the sub-channels. As a result, a<br><br>
set of Sk sub-channels are created. The sub-channels are divided into K exclusive<br>
sub-channel groups and allocated to each of K cells/sectors, so that the<br>
cells/sectors can be managed with the frequency reuse factor K. In particular,<br>
since the sub-channels employing the frequency reuse factor of 1 and sub-<br>
channels employing the frequency factor K include mutually different sub-<br>
carriers, interference may be prevented even if the frequency reuse factors of 1<br>
and K are simultaneously employed.<br>
Table 3 shows a simulation test result of the OFDMA cellular<br>
communication system performing frequency resource allocation based on<br>
multiple frequency reuse factors according to first and second embodiments of the<br>
present invention.<br>
The simulation test was carried out with respect to three sectors and<br>
nineteen cells by applying the average unit transmission rate of a sector of a<br>
central cell to the sectors and cells while applying an ideal antenna model and a<br>
real antenna model to each sector. In addition, the simulation test result was<br>
obtained under the conditions of a route attenuation index of 3.8. The simulation<br>
test was carried out with a single path model by taking fading into consideration<br>
while applying a shadowing standard deviation of 8dB if shadowing is<br>
represented.<br>
When the frequency reuse factor of 3 is employed, time resource and<br>
frequency resource are supported such that interference among 3 sectors is<br>
minimized. In addition, the frequency reuse factors 1 and 3 are allocated to the<br>
OFDMA cellular communication systems in the same ratio. That is, a length of<br>
the frequency reuse factor of 1 is identical to a length of the frequency reuse<br>
factor of 3 in the time domain with S1 = Sk used in the frequency domain.<br><br><br>
As shown in Table 3, when the frequency reuse factors of 1 and 3 are<br>
applied to the OFDMA cellular communication system according to first and<br>
second embodiments of the present invention, system performance is improved<br>
by about 10% in view of the average unit transmission rate (bits/Hz/Sec) per each<br>
sector, as compared with system performance of the OFDMA cellular<br>
communication system employing the frequency reuse factor of 1 only.<br>
As mentioned above, frequency resources with different reuse factors are<br>
allocated when transmitting a real user packet. The frequency resource (OFDM<br>
symbols or sub-channels) having a predetermined frequency reuse factor is<br>
allocated for transmitting the user packets depending on the channel state of a<br>
receiver. Herein, the channel state of the receiver includes interference in the<br>
receiver or parameters corresponding to the interference. According to the present<br>
invention, the channel state of the receiver refers to the CINR. Since the greatest<br>
interference may occur when frequency reuse factor is 1, frequency resource<br>
allocation may be performed by using the CINR with respect to the frequency<br>
reuse factor=1. Allocation of frequency resources according to the channel state<br>
of the receiver may be done so that the frequency resource with the frequency<br>
reuse factor of 1 is primarily allocated for the user packet to be transmitted to the<br>
receiver having the largest CINR. The frequency resource with the largest<br>
frequency reuse factor is finally allocated to the user packet to be transmitted to<br>
the receiver having a minimum CINR.<br>
FIG. 11 is a flowchart illustrating a procedure of allocating frequency<br>
resource, which is allocated based on frequency reuse factors thereof, according<br>
to channel states of SSs in an OFDMA cellular communication system according<br>
to a second embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 11, channel state information is feedback to the BS<br>
from each SS (step S1101) and the BS allocates frequency resources with<br>
mutually different frequency reuse factors according to the channel state<br>
information of the SSs (step S1102). In addition, the BS sorts the SSs according<br>
to the frequency resources with different frequency resources allocated to the SSs<br>
in step S1102 for data transmission (step S1103) and transmits data to the SSs by<br>
scheduling the SSs according to a predetermined scheduling algorithm (step S<br>
1104).<br>
As mentioned above, according to the present invention, frequency<br>
resources are allocated based on multiple frequency reuse factors in the OFDMA<br>
cellular communication system, so that the CINR is not lowered in the cell<br><br>
boundary region, thereby improving system performance. In addition, according<br>
to the present invention, the multiple frequency reuse factors are applied<br>
according to the channel states of the SSs, so that system capacity can be<br>
increased and reliability of the service can be improved.<br>
