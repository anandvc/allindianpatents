				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of milk cake.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Milkcake is one of the heat desiccated popular traditional dairy products of the northern and central parts of India. Well defined grains having pronounced sweetish caramel flavour with high degree of stickiness, chewiness and moderate firmness characterize the Milkcake. Traditionally, Milkcake is prepared from denedar khoa, inner part of which is caramelized more intensively (dark brown colour) and layered in between, the less caramelized (light yellowish to brown colour) portion (Mathur, 1991); Patel et al., 1994; Ramesh, 2000; Karwasra etal, 2001; and Varma etal. 2005). At the present Milkcake is generally prepared by small scale manufacturers (halwais) in unorganized sector and marketed loose (wrapped in parchment paper or in card board boxes) without any protective packaging. The process of manufacture of Milkcake ahs been standardized (Ramesh, 2000 and Karwasra et al.,2001) but the shelf life of Milkcake is limited to a few days even at refrigerated temperature due to a high water activity and lack of package protection. No systematic work has been reported to extend the shelf life of Milkcake as such. The known process for the preparation of milk cake had the following disadvantages.<br>
a)	Limited shelf life<br>
b)	Unhygienic processing and post processing handling<br>
c)	Unattractive packaging<br>
d)	Quality not uniform and safety not ensured<br>
e)	Long distance marketing not possible<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of this invention is to propose  a process for the preparation of milkcake. Another object of  this   invention   is to propose    a   process for the preparation of milkcake which has a longer shelf life in comparison to that of the known art.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to propose a process for the preparation of milkcake which is cost effective.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION;<br>
According to this invention there is provided a process for the preparation of milkcake which comprises in the steps of:<br>
i)        standardization of buffalo milk,<br>
ii) boiling the standardized milk, and allowed to foam while scraping the vessel walls to achieve partial concentration;<br>
iii)       spreading the partially concentrated milk on a hot surface and the cogulated<br>
proteins being removed and allowed to mix with the remainder of the<br>
boiling concentrated, iv)      Adding citric acid to the boiling milk for partial coagulation to import a<br>
grain texture; v)       Spreading   and   scraping the concentrate   so as to   impart   a   paste like<br>
structure<br>
vi)       Adding sugar to obtain a semi solid  consistency, vii)     Adding additional sugar and finally potassium sorbate.<br>
This invention relates to a process for preparation of Milkcake following a standard procedure, which has more than two months shelf life under ambient conditions. The final product shows texture and organoleptic quality comparable to the product prepared by the conventional process except the colour gradient between the inner and outer portions packed Milkcake. The process of Milkcake manufacture<br>
comprises of standardization of buffalo milk to a fat: solids not fat (SNF) ratio of 0.4-0.8, the total solids content of the standardized milk being 10-18 percent. The standardized milk is boiled vigorously in a steam-heated jacketed stainless steel kettle at a steam pressure of 2.0-4.0 kg cm"2 and allowed to foam while frequently scraping the kettle walls with the help of a metal (iron) scraper to achieve partial (approximately 1:4) concentration until the foam tends to subside (i.e. 10-40 min). A portion of the partially concentrated milk is then spread on the hot surfaces (sides) of the kettle (under steam pressure, 0.5-1.5 kg cm"2) and the concentrate/coagulated proteins are quickly scraped down to mix with the remainder of the concentrate simmering in the bottom of the kettle. An amount (required to bring the acidity of milk of 0.15 to 0.20% LA) of citric acid in the form of aqueous solution (0.01-10.0 percent) is sprinkled over the boiling milk in the kettle (for partial coagulation) to achieve desired type of grains in the finished product. The spreading and scraping is continued for 10-40 min so as to impart a paste like consistency to the hot concentrate (concentration approx. 1:6). At this stage, the steam pressure is<br>
reduced to 1.0-2.0 kg cm-2 and half portion (2-10 percent on milk weigh basis) of crystalline sugar is added and the working continued for 3-10 min under low heat (0.5-1.5 kg cm"2) to achieve a semi solid consistency. To this, remaining half of the crystalline sugar is added and the hot mass is worked for another 2-10 min under steam pressure of 0.1-0.5 kg cm"2. Finally, steam is put off and 0.1-0.5 percent (on dry matter basis) potassium sorbate and 0.005-0.05 percent (on total fat basis) BHA are added and the working is further continued for 3-10 min. Hot mixture is transferred into laminate pouches or tin-free (easy open end) steel cans, sealed properly and subsequently thermized at about 60-100Â°C for 30-100 min in hot air oven. Then the packaged product is removed from the oven and allowed to cool to room temperature.<br>
Further objects and   advantages   of this invention will be more   apparent   from the ensuing example in the for of a flowchart.A portion of partially concentrated milk spread on the sides of the kettle and later mixed with the remaining portion; Steam pressure: 0.8-1.0 kg/cm2Addition of citric acid (0.05% solution) for adjusting acidity of milk to 0.18%LAFurther concentration (1:3); Steam pressure: 0.5-0.6 kg/cm2Addition of sugar (half portion)Further desiccation to a semi-solid consistency Steam pressure: 0.2-0.3 kg/cm2' Time: 2-3 min<br><br><br>
