Scheme 1 illustrates step (a).<br><br>
In step (a), a compound of Formula 2 is treated with a compound of Formula 3 wherein R3 is C1-C4 alkyl (a fumarate ester or maleate ester or a mixture thereof may be used) in the presence of a base and a solvent. The base is typically a metal alkoxide salt such as sodium methoxide, potassium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, potassium ethoxide, potassium tert-butoxide, lithium  tert-butoxide, and the like. Greater than 0.5 equivalents of base versus the compound of Formula 2 should be used, preferably between 0.9 and 1.3 equivalents. Greater than 1.0 equivalents of the compound of Formula 3 should be used, preferably between 1.0 to 1.3 equivalents. Polar protic and polar aprotic organic solvents can be used, such as alcohols, acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, N,N-dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide and the like. Preferred solvents are alcohols such as methanol and ethanol. It is especially preferred that the alcohol be the same as that making up the fumarate or maleate ester and the alkoxide base. The reaction is typically conducted by mixing the compound of Formula 2 and the base in the solvent. The mixture can be heated or cooled to a desired temperature and the compound of Formula 3 added over a period of time. Typically reaction temperatures are between 0 °C and the boiling point of the solvent used. The reaction may be conducted under greater than atmospheric pressure in order to increase the boiling point of the solvent. Temperatures between about 30 and 90 °C are generally preferred. The addition time can be as quick as heat transfer allows. Typical addition times are between 1 minute and 2 hours. Optimum reaction temperature and addition time vary depending upon the identities of the compounds of Formula 2 and Formula 3. After addition, the reaction mixture can be held for a time at the reaction temperature. Depending upon the reaction temperature, the required hold time maybe from 0 to 2 hours. Typical hold times are from about 10 to 60 minutes. The reaction mass then can be acidified by adding an organic acid, such as acetic acid and the like, or an inorganic acid, such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid and the like. Depending on the reaction conditions and the means of isolation, compounds of Formula 4 wherein R3 is H or compounds of Formula 4 wherein R3 is C1-C4 alkyl can be prepared. For example, a compound of Formula 4 wherein R3 is C1-C4 alkyl can be hydrolyzed in situ to a<br><br>
compound of Formula 4 wherein R3 is H when water is present in the reaction mixture. Compounds of Formula 4 wherein R3 is H can be readily transformed to compounds of Formula 4 wherein R3 is C1-C4 alkyl using esterification methods well-known in the art. Compounds of Formula 4 wherein R3 is C1-C4alkyl are preferred. The desired product, a compound of Formula 4, can be isolated by methods known to those skilled in the art, such as crystallization, extraction or distillation.<br>
In step (1) as illustrated in Scheme 2, a compound of Formula 4 is treated with a halogenating reagent usually in the presence of a solvent. Halogenating reagents that can be used include phosphorus oxyhalides, phosphorus trihalides, phosphorus pentahalides, thionyl chloride, dihalotrialkylphophoranes, dihalodiphenylphosphoranes, oxalyl chloride and phosgene. Preferred are phosphorus oxyhalides and phosphorus pentahalides. To obtain complete conversion, at least 0.33 equivalents of phosphorus oxyhalide versus the compound of Formula 4 should be used, preferably between 0.33 and 1.2 equivalents. To obtain complete conversion, at least 0.20 equivalents of phosphorus pentahalide versus the compound of Formula 4 should be used, preferably between about 0.20 and 1.0 equivalents. Compounds of Formula 4 wherein R3 is C1-C4 alkyl are preferred for this reaction.<br><br>
Typical solvents for this halogenation include halogenated alkanes, such as dichloromethane, chloroform, chlorobutane and the like, aromatic solvents, such as benzene, xylene, chlorobenzene and the like, ethers, such as tetrahydrofuran,p-dioxane, diethyl ether, and the like, and polar aprotic solvents such as acetonitrile, N,N-dimethylformamide, and the like. Optionally, an organic base, such as triethylamine, pyridine, N,N-dimethylaniline or the like, can be added. Addition of a catalyst, such as N,N-dimethylformamide, is also an option. Preferred is the process in which the solvent is acetonitrile and a base is absent. Typically, neither a base nor a catalyst is required when acetonitrile solvent is used. The preferred process is conducted by mixing the compound of Formula 4 in acetonitrile. The halogenating reagent is then added over a convenient time and the mixture is then held at the desired temperature until the reaction is complete. The reaction temperature is typically between 20 °C and the boiling point of acetonitrile, and the reaction time is typically<br><br>
less than 2 hours. The reaction mass is then neutralized with an inorganic base, such as sodium bicarbonate, sodium hydroxide and the like, or an organic base, such as sodium acetate. The desired product, a compound of Formula I, can be isolated by methods known to those skilled in the art, including crystallization, extraction and distillation.<br>
In step (2) the compound of Formula I wherein R3 is C1-C4 alkyl, an ester, can be hydrolyzed to a compound of Formula I wherein R3 is H, a carboxylic acid. The hydrolysis can be catalyzed by acids, metal ions, and by enzymes. lodotrimethylsilane is noted as an example of an acid which can be used to catalyze the hydrolysis (see Advanced Organic Chemistry, Third Ed., Jerry March, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. New York, 1985, pp. 334-338 for a review of methods). Base-catalyzed hydrolytic methods are not recommended for the hydrolysis of compounds of Formula I and can result in decomposition. The carboxylic acid can be isolated by methods known to those skilled in the ait, including crystallization, extraction and distillation.<br>
In step (3) as illustrated in Scheme 3, a compound of Formula I is treated with an oxidizing agent optionally in the presence of acid. A compound of Formula I wherein R3 is C1-C4 alkyl (i.e. a preferred product of step (1)) is preferred as starting material for step (3). The oxidizing agent can be hydrogen peroxide, organic peroxides, potassium persulfate, sodium persulfate, ammonium persulfate, potassium monopersulfate (e.g., Oxone®) or potassium permanganate. To obtain complete conversion, at least one equivalent of oxidizing agent versus the compound of Formula I should be used, preferably from about one to two equivalents. This oxidation is typically carried out in the presence of a solvent. The solvent can be an ether, such as tetrahydrofuran, p-dioxane and the like, an organic ester, such as ethyl acetate, dimethyl carbonate and the like, or a polar aprotic organic such as JV,iV-dimethylformamide, acetonitrile and the like. Acids suitable for use in the oxidation step include inorganic acids, such as sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid and the like, and organic acids, such as acetic acid, benzoic acid and the like. The acid, when used, should be used in greater than 0.1 equivalents versus the compound of Formula I. To obtain complete conversion, one to five equivalents of acid can be used. For the compounds of Formula I wherein X is CR2, the preferred oxidant is hydrogen peroxide and the oxidation is preferably carried out in the absence of acid. For the compounds of Formula I wherein X is N, the preferred oxidant is potassium persulfate and the oxidation is preferably carried out in the presence of sulfuric acid. The reaction can be carried out by mixing the compound of Formula I in the desired solvent and, if used, the acid. The oxidant can then be added at a convenient rate. The reaction temperature is typically varied from as low as about 0 °C up to the boiling point of the solvent in order to obtain a reasonable reaction time to complete the reaction, preferably less than 8 hours. The desired product, a compound of Formula II wherein<br><br>
R3 is C1-C4 alkyl, can be isolated by methods known to those skilled in the art, including crystallization, extraction and distillation.<br>
Scheme 3<br><br>
In step (4) as illustrated in Scheme 4, a compound of Formula II wherein R3 is C1-C4 alkyl, an ester, can be converted to a compound of Formula II wherein R3 is H, a carboxylic acid. Methods for converting esters to carboxylic acids are well known to those skilled in the art. Compounds of Formula II (R3 is C1-C4 alkyl) can be converted to compounds of Formula II (R3 is H) by numerous methods including nucleophilic cleavage under anhydrous conditions or hydro lytic methods involving the use of either acids or bases (see T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2nd ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York, 1991, pp. 224-269 for a review of methods). For the method of Scheme 4, base-catalyzed hydrolytic methods are preferred. Suitable bases include alkali metal (such as lithium, sodium or potassium hydroxides. For example, the ester can be dissolved in a mixture of water and an alcohol such as ethanol. Upon treatment with sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, the ester is saponified to provide the sodium or potassium salt of the carboxylic acid. Acidification with a strong acid, such as hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid, yields the carboxylic acid. The carboxylic acid can be isolated by methods known to those skilled in the art, including crystallization, extraction and distillation.<br><br>
It is noted that certain compounds of Formula I wherein R1 is halogen can be prepared from other compounds of Formula I wherein R1 is a different halogen or is a<br><br>
sulfonate group such as/&gt;-toluenesulfonate, benzenesulfonate and methanesulfonate. For example, a compound of Formula I wherein R1 is Br can be prepared by treating with hydrogen bromide the corresponding compound of Formula I wherein R1 is CI or p-toluenesulfonate. The reaction is conducted in a suitable solvent such as dibromomethane, dichloromethane or acetonitrile. The reaction can be conducted at or near atmospheric pressure or above atmospheric pressure in a pressure vessel. When R1 in the starting compound of Formula I is a halogen such as CI, the reaction is preferably conducted in such a way that the hydrogen halide generated from the reaction is removed by sparging or other suitable means. The reaction can be conducted between about 0 and 100 °C, most conveniently near ambient temperature (e.g., about 10 to 40 °C), and more preferably between about 20 and 30 °C. Addition of a Lewis acid catalyst (e.g., aluminum tribromide for preparing Formula I wherein R1 is Br) can facilitate the reaction. The product of Formula I is isolated by the usual methods known to those skilled in the art, including extraction, distillation and crystallization.<br>
Starting compounds of Formula I wherein R1 is halogen can be prepared as already described for Scheme 2. Starting compounds of Formula I wherein R1 is a sulfonate group can likewise be prepared from corresponding compounds of Formula 4 by standard methods such as treatment with a sulfonyl chloride (e.g., jp-toluenesulfonyl chloride) and base such as a tertiary amine (e.g., triethylamine) in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane.<br>

Utility<br>
The compounds of Formulae I, II and 4 are useful as synthetic intermediates for preparing a compound of Formula III<br><br>
wherein X, R1, R2 and n are defined as above; R6 is CH3, C1or Br; R7 is F, C1 Br, I or CF3; and R8 is C1-C4  alkyl.<br>
Compounds of Formula III are useful as insecticides.<br><br>
Compounds of Formula III can be prepared from compounds of Formula II (and in turn from compounds of Formula 4 and I) by the processes outlined in Schemes 5-7.<br>
Coupling of a pyrazolecarboxylic acid of Formula Ha (a compound of Formula II wherein R3 is H) with an anthranilic acid of Formula 5 provides the benzoxazinone of Formula 6. In Scheme 5, a benzoxazinone of Formula 6 is prepared directly via sequential addition of methanesulfonyl chloride in the presence of a tertiary amine such as triethylarhine or pyridine to a pyrazolecarboxylic acid of Formula Ha, followed by the addition of an anthranilic acid of Formula 5, followed by a second addition of tertiary amine and methanesulfonyl chloride. This procedure generally affords good yields of the benzoxazinone.<br>
