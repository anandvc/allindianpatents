				<td>BENZIMIDAZOLE-CARBOXAMIDE COMPOUNDS AS 5-HT4 RECEPTOR<br>
AGONISTS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention is directed to benzimidazole-carboxamide compounds which are useful as 5-HT4 receptor agonists. The invention is also directed to pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds, methods of using such compounds for treating or preventing medical conditions mediated by 5-HT4 receptor activity, and processes and intermediates useful for preparing such compounds.<br>
State of the Art<br>
Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is a neurotransmitter that is widely distributed throughout the body, both hi the central nervous system and in peripheral systems. At least seven subtypes of serotonin receptors have been identified and the interaction of serotonin with these different receptors is linked to a wide variety of physiological functions. There has been, therefore, substantial interest in developing therapeutic agents that target specific 5-HT receptor subtypes,<br>
In particular, characterization of 5-HT4 receptors and identification of pharmaceutical agents that interact with them has been the focus of significant recent activity. (See, for example, the review by Langlois and Fischmeister, J. Med, Chem. 2003, 46, 319-344.) 5-HT4 receptor agonists are useful for the treatment of disorders of reduced motility of the gastrointestinal tract. Such disorders include irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), chronic constipation, functional dyspepsia, delayed gastric emptying,<br>
gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), gastroparesis, post-operative ileus, intestinal pseudo-obstruction, and drug-induced delayed transit. In addition, it has been suggested that some 5-HT4 receptor agonist compounds may be used in the treatment of central nervous system disorders including cognitive disorders, behavioral disorders, mood disorders, and disorders of control of autonomic function.<br>
Despite the broad utility of pharmaceutical agents modulating 5-HT4 receptor activity, few 5-HT4 receptor agonist compounds are in clinical use at present. Accordingly, there is a need for new 5-HT4 receptor agonists that achieve their desired effects with minimal side effects. Preferred agents may possess, among other properties, improved selectivity, potency, pharmacokinetic properties, and/or duration of action.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention provides novel compounds that possess 5-HT4 receptor agonist activity. Among other properties, compounds of the invention have been found to be potent and selective 5-HT4 receptor agonists. In addition, preferred compounds of the invention have been found to exhibit favorable pharmacokinetic properties in an animal model which are predictive of good bioavailability upon oral administration.<br>
Accordingly, the invention provides a compound of formula (I):<br>

Additionally, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art, conventional protecting groups may be necessary to prevent certain functional .groups from undergoing undesired reactions. The choice of a suitable protecting group for a particular functional group, as well as suitable conditions for protection and deprotection, are well known in the art. For example, numerous protecting groups, and their introduction and removal, are described<br>

In formula (IV), X1 represents R3, C(R6R7)R8, or C(HR9)OR10, such that -C(O)X' corresponds to X, as set forth above formula (IV). In the amide coupling reaction of intermediate (H), between about 1 and about 1.5 equivalents of the carboxylic acid (IV) are first contacted with between 1 and about 1.5 equivalents of a toupling agent such as O-(7-axabenzotrizol-l-yl)-N,N,N',N'-tetramethylurornium hexafluorophosphate (HATU) in a polar aprotic solvent such as dimethylformamide or those discussed above.

Scheme A (Scheme Removed)<br>
where P1 and P2 independently represent an amino protecting group, such as tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc).<br>
First, a carboxylic acid of formula (VI) is reacted with a protected aminomethyl piperidine to form a protected intermediate of formula (VII). This reaction is typically conducted by contacting (VI) with between about 1 and about 2 equivalents of protected aminomethylpiperidine in a polar aprotic diluent, in the presence of an amide coupling agent described above, for example N-ethyl-N-(3-dimethylammopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) combined with hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) or 1,1'-carbonyldiimidazole (GDI) combined with l,4-diazabicyclo[2,2,2]octane (DABCO).

The protecting group P1 is removed from intermediate (VII) by conventional means to provide intermediate (VIII). For example, when Boc is used as the protecting<br>
group, it may be removed by treatment with an acid, such as trifluoroacetic acid or hydrochloric acid.<br>
An intermediate of formula (IX) is then formed by the reductive animation of intermediate (VIS) with a protected piperidine-carboxaldehyde. This reaction is typically conducted by contacting (VIII) with between about 1 and about 2 equivalents of the protected piperidine-carboxaldehyde in an inert diluent in the presence of between about 1 and about 2 equivalents of a reducing agent. Optionally, about one equivalent of a weak acid, such as acetic acid can be included to accelerate the reaction. The reaction may be conducted at a temperature between about 0 °C and about 30 °C, typically between about 20 °C and about 30 °C, for about 0.25 to about 2 hours, or until the reaction is substantially complete.<br>

Typical reducing agents include sodium triacetoxyborohydride, sodium borohydride, and sodium cyanoborohydride. The product (IX) is isolated by standard procedures. When the amine (VIII) is supplied as an acid salt, typically between about 1 and about 3 equivalents of an amine base, such as N,N-diisopropylethylamine, is included in the reaction. Finally, the protecting group P2 is removed from intermediate (IX) by conventional procedures to provide the piperidinylmethyl-piperidinylmethyl intermediate (II).<br>

where R represents methyl or hydrogen. Intermediate (XI) is reacted with a carboxylic acid R1C(O)OH to form the acid intermediate (VI). This reaction is typically conducted by contacting the acid or ester (XI) with between about 2 and about 4 equivalents of the carboxylic acid R1C(O)OH in an aqueous acidic solution. The reaction is typically conducted at a temperature in the range of about 80 °C to about 100 °C for about 12 to<br>
about 72 hours. The pH of the solution is then raised by the addition of base, such as sodium hydroxide, and the product isolated by conventional means.<br>
A convenient process for providing intermediate (XI) as the methyl ester uses 2-amino-3-nitrobenzoic acid methyl ester (X):  <br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
as the starting material. Typically, 2-amino-3-nitrobenzoic acid methyl ester (X) is dissolved in a polar diluent and reduced by exposure to a hydrogen atmosphere in the presence of a transition metal catalyst to provide the diaminobenzoic acid methyl ester (XI). The reaction is typically conducted at ambient temperature for about 12 to about 72 hours.<br>

The reaction is typically performed under the conditions described above for the reaction of amine (VIE) with the protected piperidine-carboxaldehyde in Scheme A. <br>
Intermediate (XIII) can be prepared by the reaction of 4-hydroxymethylpiperidine with a reagent L—X, of formula (III), followed by oxidation of the resulting intermediate. For example, for the particular case of X is -C(O)OCH3, intermediate (XIH) can be prepared as shown in Scheme E.<br>

First 4-hydroxymethylpiperidine is reacted with methylchloroformate to form the hydroxymethylpiperidine intermediate (XV). The reaction is typically conducted by contacting 4-hydroxymethylpiperidine in an aqueous solution with between about 3 and about 5 equivalents of methylchloroformate in the presence of between about 3 and about 5 equivalents of base. The reaction is typically conducted at a temperature in the range of about 0 °C to about 30 °C for about 12 to about 72 hours or until the reaction is substantially complete. Intermediate (XV) is then oxidized to form the formylpiperidinyl intermediate (XIII). The oxidation reaction typically makes use of an oxidation reagent such as a combination of oxalyl chloride and dimethylsulfoxide (Swern oxidation), a<br>
chromate reagent, such as pyridinium chlorochromate, or an oxidizing agent, such as sodium hypochlorite, together with a catalyst such as 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy free radical (TEMPO).<br>

Crystalline Forms<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides 4-(4-{[(2-isopropyl-lH-benzoimidazole-4-carbonyl)amino]methyl}-piperidin-l-yhnethyl)piperidine-l-carboxylic acid methyl ester in crystalline freebase form or a solvate thereof. Three distinguishable forms of crystalline 4-(4- {[(2-isopropyl-1 H-benzoimidazole-4-carbonyl)amino]methyl} -piperidin-l-ylmethyl)piperidine-l-carboxylic acid methyl ester (hereinafter compound 1) have been observed.<br>
Crystalline Form I of the present invention is a crystalline freebase. Form I is characterized by a powder x-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern having two or more diffraction peaks at 20 values selected from 15.08±0.20,15.41±0.20, 19.00±0.20, 19.70±0.20. and 23.68±0.20. In particular, Form I is characterized by a powder x-ray diffraction pattern having diffraction peaks at 29 values of 19.00±0.20 and 19.70±0.20.<br>
As is well known in the field of powder x-ray diffraction, peak positions of PXRD spectra are relatively less sensitive to experimental details, such as details of sample preparation and instrument geometry, than are the relative peak heights. Thus, in one aspect, the crystalline Form I is characterized by a powder x-ray diffraction pattern in which the peak positions are substantially in accordance with those shown in Figure 1.<br>
Form I has been further characterized by x-ray diffraction analysis of crystal structure, providing the following lattice parameters: unit cell is orthorhombic with dimensions a = 16.9053 A, b = 9.5172 A, c = 15.4659 A; space group is Pna2i; calculated density is 1.22 g/cm3. The resulting molecular structure confirms the chemical composition is that of compound !_ and that the assymetric unit does not contain water or other solvent molecules.   Powder x-ray diffraction peaks predicted from the derived atomic positions are in excellent agreement with observed results.<br>
Crystalline Form I of the present invention is also characterized by high temperature thermal stability as evidenced by its differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) profile which exhibits a peak in endothermic heat flow in the range of about 145 °C to<br>
about 155 °C, typically between about 146 and 148 °C as illustrated in Figure 2, which<br>
may be identified as a melting point. Furthermore, the thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) profile shows no significant weight change event below the onset of degradation which is above about 240 °C.<br>
In yet another aspect, the present crystalline form is characterized by its infrared absorption spectrum which shows significant absorption bands at about 766, 1097,1251, 1413, 1449, 1579, 1609, 1640, and 1696 cm'1.<br>
The present crystalline form has been demonstrated to have a reversible sorption/desorption profile with an exceptionally low level of hygroscopicity (i.e., less than about 0.25 % weight gain in the humidity range of 2 % relative humidity to 90 % relative humidity at room temperature) as shown in Figure 3.<br>
Additionally, crystalline Form I of compound 1. has been found to be stable upon exposure to elevated temperature and humidity. After storage for three months at 40 °C and 75 % relative humidity, there were no detectable changes in the DSC, TGA, or PXRD profiles, in the chemical purity as determined by HPLC analysis, and no observable changes in visual appearance. There were also no changes detectable by DSC, TGA, or PXRD after milling particles of Form I from a volume-based mean particle size of about 470 microns to a volume-based mean particle size of about 15, about 22, or about 29 microns.<br>
Crystalline Form n of compound 1 is characterized by the DSC and TGA profiles of Figure 4. TGA analysis shows an onset of weight loss in the temperature range of about 95 to about 105 °C , typically at about 100 °C, in a step profile consistent with water or solvent loss, while the DSC profile exhibits a peak in endothermic heat flow at between about 143 and about 145 °C, concurrent with the melting event. The PXRD pattern of Form II is indistinguishable from that of Form I. While positive identification has not been made, the TGA profile of Form II is consistent with the interpretation of Form n as a solvate.<br>
The third crystalline form of the invention has been identified as a monohydrate. Form HI is characterized by a powder x-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern having two or more diffraction peaks at 29 values selected from 9.14±0.20, 12.41±0.20,12.74±0.20, 17.75±0.20, 18.47±0.20, 20.63±0.20, 21.13±0.20, and 27.05±0.20, as illustrated in Figure 5. In particular, Form III is characterized by a powder x-ray diffraction pattern having diffraction peaks at 20 values of 9.14±0.20 and 20.63±0.20.<br>
The DSC and TGA profiles of Form III, shown in Figure 6, demonstrate the material undergoes a step profile weight loss with onset in the temperature range of about 65 to about 75 °C , typically at about 70 °C, and a peak in endothermic heat flow at a temperature between about 90 and about 100 °C, consistent with loss of the monohydrate water and subsequent melting.   Form III has been further characterized by x-ray diffraction analysis of crystal structure, providing the following lattice parameters: unit cell is monoclinic with dimensions a = 14.8101 A, b = 9.9985 A, c = 17.9222 A; p = 106.3020 °, space group is P21/n; calculated density is 1.23 g/cm3. The resulting molecular structure confirms the chemical composition is that of compound 1 and that the assymetric unit contains a single water molecule.<br>
The separate crystalline forms of the present invention may be reproducibly obtained by the following procedures. Crystalline Form I may be prepared by dispersing compound 1 in an inert diluent selected from acetonitrile, ether, cyclohexane, and ethyl acetate in a proportion of between about 15 mg and about 25 mg compound 1 per milliliter of diluent to form a mixture, and allowing the mixture to evaporate at ambient temperature, resulting in crystal formation.<br>
Alternatively, Form I may be obtained by a solvent exchange process from crude compound 1 in solution, without first isolating amorphous compound 1, as described in Example 216 below. Typically the reaction to prepare compound 1, is carried out in a polar aprotic diluent, such as dichloromethane, in which the compound is highly soluble. To prepare crystalline Form I, acetonitrile is added while vacuum distilling the crude reaction product to remove the dichloromethane. A mixture having between about 1 and about 200 mg compound 1 per milliliter of acetonitrile, typically between about 50 and about 125 mg compound 1 per milliliter of acetonitrile, is prepared from the residue remaining after distillation and heated to a temperature sufficient to dissolve the residue, for example a temperature of about 75 °C. The mixture is then cooled to a temperature of no more than about 20 °C to provide crystalline Form I, which is isolated by conventional procedures. In an exemplary process, the mixture is cooled until nucleation occurs, typically at a temperature of between about 55 and about 65 °C and held at that temperature for about an hour. It is then cooled at a rate of between about 0.25 and about 0.4 °C per minute to a temperature of about 20 °C. To increase the yield of crystalline Form I, the mixture may be further cooled at a rate of between about 0.5 and about<br>
0.75 °C per minute to a temperature of between about 0 and about 5 °C.<br>
To prepare Form 11, amorphous compound 1 is dispersed in hexane at ambient temperature to a final concentration of about 10 mg/mL and the resulting mixture is sonicated. After about 24 hours at ambient temperature, crystalline solids of Form n are obtained.<br>
Form in is prepared by dissolving amorphous amorphous compound !_ in a 1:1 ethanol: water solvent mixture at ambient temperature to a final concentration of about 20 mg/mL and sonicating the solution for about 30 seconds. The solution is allowed to partially evaporate in an uncapped vial. After about 24 hours, crystalline solids of Form III are obtained.<br>

Utility<br>
The benzimidazole-carboxamide compounds of the invention are 5-HT4 receptor agonists and therefore are expected to be useful for treating medical conditions mediated by 5-HT4 receptors or associated with 5-HT4 receptor activity, i.e. medical conditions which are ameliorated by treatment with a 5-HT4 receptor agonist. Such medical<br>
conditions include, but are not limited to, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), chronic constipation, functional dyspepsia, delayed gastric emptying, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GEKD), gastroparesis, post-operative ileus, intestinal pseudo-obstruction, and drug-induced delayed transit. In addition, it has been suggested that some 5-HT4 receptor agonist compounds may be used in the treatment of central nervous system disorders including cognitive disorders, behavioral disorders, mood disorders, and disorders of control of autonomic function.<br>
In particular, the compounds of the invention increase motility of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and thus are expected to be useful for treating disorders of the GI tract caused by reduced motility in mammals, including humans. Such GI motility disorders include, by way of illustration, chronic constipation, constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (C-IBS), diabetic and idiopathic gastroparesis, and functional dyspepsia.<br>
In one aspect, therefore, the invention provides a method of increasing motility of the gastrointestinal tract in a mammal, the method comprising administering to the mammal a therapeutically effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition comprising a phamiaceutically-acceptable carrier and a compound of the invention.<br>
When used to treat disorders of reduced motility of the GI tract or other conditions mediated by 5-HT4 receptors, the compounds of the invention will typically be administered orally in a single daily dose or in multiple doses per day, although other forms of administration may be used. The amount of active agent administered per dose or the total amount administered per day will typically be determined by a physician, in the light of the relevant circumstances, including the condition to be treated, the chosen route of administration, the actual compound administered and its relative activity, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, the severity of the patient's symptoms, and the like.<br>
Suitable doses for treating disorders of reduced motility of the GI tract or other disorders mediated by 5-HT4 receptors will range from about 0.0007 to about 20 mg/kg/day of active agent, including from about 0.0007 to about 1 mg/kg/day. For an average 70 kg human, this would amount to from about 0.05 to about 70 mg per day of active agent.<br>
In one aspect of the invention, the compounds of the invention are used to treat chronic constipation. When used to treat chronic constipation, the compounds of the<br>
invention will typically be administered orally in a single daily dose or in multiple doses per day. Preferably, the dose for treating chronic constipation will range from about 0.05 to about 70 mg per day.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, the compounds of the invention are used to treat irritable bowel syndrome. When used to treat constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome, the compounds of the invention will typically be administered orally in a single daily dose or in multiple doses per day. Preferably, the dose for treating constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome will range from about 0.05 to about 70 mg per day. In another aspect of the invention, the compounds of the invention are used to treat diabetic gastroparesis. When used to treat diabetic gastroparesis, the compounds of the invention will typically be administered orally in a single daily dose or in multiple doses per day. Preferably, the dose for treating diabetic gastroparesis will range from about 0.05 to about 70 mg per day.<br>
In yet another aspect of the invention, the compounds of the invention are used to treat functional dyspepsia. When used to treat functional dyspepsia, the compounds of the invention will typically be administered orally in a single daily dose or in multiple doses per day. Preferably, the dose for treating functional dyspepsia will range from about 0.05 to about 70 mg per day.<br>
The invention also provides a method of treating a mammal having a disease or condition associated with 5-HT4 receptor activity, the method comprising administering to the mammal a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention or of a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the invention.<br>
As described above, compounds of the invention are 5-HT4 receptor agonists. The invention further provides, therefore, a method of agonizing a 5-HT4 receptor in a mammal, the method comprising administering a compound of the invention to the mammal. In addition, the compounds of the invention are also useful as research tools for investigating or studying biological systems or samples having 5-HT4 receptors, or for discovering new 5-HT4 receptor agonists. Moreover, since compounds of the invention exhibit binding selectivity for 5-HT4 receptors as compared with binding to receptors of other 5-HT subtypes, particularly 5-HT3 receptors, such compounds are particularly useful for studying the effects of selective agonism of 5-HT4 receptors in a biological system or sample. Any suitable biological system or sample having 5-HT4 receptors may be employed in such studies which may be conducted either in vitro or in vivo.<br>
Representative biological systems or samples suitable for such studies include, but are 100 limited to, cells, cellular extracts, plasma membranes, tissue samples, mammals (such as mice, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, dogs, pigs, etc.) and the like.<br>
In this aspect of the invention, a biological system or sample comprising a 5-HT4 receptor is contacted with a 5-HT4 receptor-agonizing amount of a compound of the invention. The effects of agonizing the 5-HT4 receptor are then determined using conventional procedures and equipment, such as radioligand binding assays and functional assays, Such functional assays include ligand-mediated changes in intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), ligand-mediated changes in activity of the enzyme adenylyl cyclase (which synthesizes cAMP), ligand-mediated changes in incorporation of analogs of guanosine triphosphate (GTP), such as [35S]GTPyS (guanosine 5'-O-(y-thio)triphosphate) or GTP-Eu, into isolated membranes via receptor catalyzed exchange of GTP analogs for GDP analogs, ligand-mediated changes in free intracellular calcium ions (measured, for example, with a fluorescence-linked imaging plate reader or FLEPR® from Molecular Devices, Inc.), and measurement of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation. A compound of the invention may agonize or increase the activation of 5-HT4 receptors in any of the functional assays listed above, or assays of a similar nature. A 5-HT4 receptor-agonizing amount of a compound of the invention will typically range from about 1 nanomolar to about 500 nanomolar.<br>
Additionally, the compounds of the invention can be used as research tools for discovering new 5-HT4 receptor agonists. In this embodiment, 5-HT4 receptor binding or functional data for a test compound or a group of test compounds is compared to the 5-HT4 receptor binding or functional data for a compound of the invention to identify test compounds that have superior binding or functional activity, if any. This aspect of the invention includes, as separate embodiments, both the generation of comparison data (using the appropriate assays) and the analysis of the test data to identify test compounds of interest.<br>
Among other properties, compounds of the invention have been found to be potent agonists of the 5-HT4 receptor and to exhibit substantial selectivity for the 5-HT4 receptor subtype over the 5-HT3 receptor subtype in radioligand binding assays. Further, compounds of the invention of which particular mention was made have demonstrated superior pharmacokinetic properties in a rat model. Such compounds are thus expected to<br>
be highly bioavailable upon oral administration. In addition, these compounds have been<br>
shown not to exhibit an unacceptable level of inhibition of the potassium ion current in in vitro voltage-clamp model using isolated whole cells expressing the hERG cardiac potassium channel. The voltage-clamp assay is an accepted pre-clinical method of assessing the potential for pharmaceutical agents to change the pattern of cardiac repolarization, specifically to cause, so-called QT prolongation, which has been associated with cardiac arrhythmia. (Cavero et al, Opinion on Pharmacotherapy, 2000,1, 947-73, Fermini et al, Nature Reviews Drug Discovery, 2003, 2, 439-447) Accordingly, pharmaceutical compositions comprising compounds of the invention are expected to have an acceptable cardiac profile.<br>
There properties, as well as the utility of the compounds of the invention, can be demonstrated using various in vitro and in vivo assays well-known to those skilled in the art. Representative assays are described in further detail in the following examples.<br>

Assays were incubated for 60 min at room temperature, then the binding reactions were terminated by rapid filtration over 96-well GF/B glass fiber filter plates (Packard BioScience Co., Meriden, CT) presoaked in 0.3% polyethyleneimine. Filter plates were washed three times with filtration buffer (ice-cold 50mM HEPES, pH7.4) to remove unbound radioactivity. Plates were dried, 35 uL Microscint-20 liquid scintillation fluid (Packard BioScience Co., Meriden, CT) was added to each well and plates were counted in a Packard Topcount liquid scintillation counter (Packard BioScience Co., Meriden, CT). Binding data were analyzed using the non-linear regression procedure described above to determine Ki values. The BOTTOM (curve minimum) was fixed to the value for nonspecific binding, as determined in the presence of 10 µM MDL72222. The quantity [L] in the Cheng-Prusoff equation was defined as the concentration [3H]-GR65630.<br>
Selectivity lor me 5-HT4 receptor subtype with respect to the 5-HT3 receptor subtype was calculated as the ratio Ki(5-HT3A)/Ki(5-HT4(c)). The compounds of the invention which were tested in this assay had a 5-HT4/5-HT3 receptor subtype selectivity ranging from about 4000 to upwards of 400,000.<br>
Assay 3: Whole-cell cAMP Accumulation Flashplate Assay with HEK-293 cells expressing human 5-HT4(C) Receptors<br>
In this assay, the functional potency of a test compound was determined by measuring the amount of cyclic AMP produced when HEK-293 cells expressing 5-HT4 receptors were contacted with different concentrations of test compound.<br>
a.	Cell Culture<br>
HEK-293 (human embryonic kidney) cells stably-transfected with cloned human 5-HT4(c) receptor cDNA were prepared expressing the receptor at two different densities: (1) at a density of about 0.5-0.6 pmol/mg protein, as determined using a [3H]-GR113808 membrane radioligand binding assay, and (2) at a density of about 6.0 pmol/mg protein. The cells were grown in T-225 flasks in Dulbecco's Modified Eagles Medium (DMEM) containing 4,500 mg/L D-glucose (GIBCO-Invitrogen Corp.: Cat #11965) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (GIBCO-Invitrogen Corp.: Cat #10437) and (100 units) penicillin-(100 µg) streptomycin/ml (GIBCO-Invitrogen Corp.: Cat #15140) in a 5% CO2, humidified incubator at 37°C. Cells were grown under continuous selection pressure by the addition of geneticin (800 µg/mL: GIBCO-Invitrogen Corp.: Cat #10131) to the medium.<br>
b.	Cell Preparation<br>
Cells were grown to roughly 60-80% confluency. Twenty to twenty-two hours prior to assay, cells were washed twice, and fed, with serum-free DMEM containing 4,500 mg/L D-glucose (GIBCO-Invitrogen Corp.: Cat #11965). To harvest the cells, the media was aspirated and 10 mL Versene (GIBCO-Invitrogen Corp.: Cat #15040) was added to each T-225 flask. Cells were incubated for 5 min at RT and then dislodged from the flask by mechanical agitation, The cell suspension was transferred to a centrifuge tube containing an equal volume of pre-warmed (37°C) dPBS and centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 rpm. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet was re-suspended in pre-warmed (37°C) stimulation buffer (10mL equivalent per 2-3 T-225 flasks). This time was noted and marked as time zero. The cells were counted with a Coulter counter (count above 8<br>
µm, flask yield was 1-2x10' cells/flask). Cells were resuspended at a concentration of 5 x 105 cells/ml in pre-warmed (37°C) stimulation buffer (as provided in the flashplate kit) and preincubated at 37°C for 10 min.<br>
cAMP assays were performed in a radioimmunoassay format using the Flashplate Adenylyl Cyclase Activation Assay System with 125I-cAMP (SMP004B, PerkinElmer Life Sciences Inc., Boston, MA), according to the manufacturer's instructions.<br>
Cells were grown and prepared as described above. Final cell concentrations in the assay were 25 x 103 cells/well and the final assay volume was 100 µL. Test compounds were received as 10 mM stock solutions in DMSO, diluted to 400 uM into 50 mM HEPES pH 7.4 at 25°C, containing 0.1% BSA, and serial (1:5) dilutions then made in the same buffer. Cyclic AMP accumulation assays were performed with 11 different concentrations of compound ranging from 10 pM to 100 µM (final assay concentrations). A 5-HT concentration-response curve (10 pM to 100 µM) was included on every plate. The cells were incubated, with shaking, at 37°C for 15 min and the reaction terminated by addition of 100 µl of ice-cold detection buffer (as provided in the flashplate kit) to each well. The plates were sealed and incubated at 4°C overnight. Bound radioactivity was quantified by scintillation proximity spectroscopy using the Topcount (Packard BioScience Co., Meriden, CT).<br>
The amount of cAMP produced per mL of reaction was extrapolated from the cAMP standard curve, according to the instructions provided in the manufacturer's user manual. Data were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis with the GraphPad Prism Software package using the 3-parameter sigmoidal dose-response model (slope constrained to unity). Potency data are reported as pEC50 values, the negative decadic logarithm of the EC50 value, where EC50 is the effective concentration for a 50 % maximal response.<br>
Test compounds exhibiting a higher pEC50 value in this assay have a higher potency for agonizing the 5-HT4 receptor. The compounds of the invention which were tested in this assay, for example, in the cell line (1) having a density of about 0.5-0.6 pmol/mg protein, had a pEC50 value ranging from about 7.5 to about 9.5.<br>
Assay 4: In vitro Voltage Clamp Assay of Inhibition of Potassium Ion Current in Whole Cells Expressing the hERG Cardiac Potassium Channel<br>
CHO-K1 cells stably transfected with hERG cDNA were obtained from Gail Robertson at the University of Wisconsin. Cells were held in cryogenic storage until needed. Cells were expanded and passaged in Dulbecco's Modified Eagles Medium/F12 supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum and 200 µg/mL geneticin. Cells were seeded onto poly-D-lysine (100 ug/mL) coated glass coverslips, in 35 mm2 dishes (containing 2 mL medium) at a density that enabled isolated cells to be selected for whole cell voltage-clamp studies. The dishes were maintained in a humidified, 5% CO-2 environment at 37°C.<br>
Extracellular solution was prepared at least every 7 days and stored at 4°C when not in use. The extracellular solution contained (mM): NaCl (137), KC1 (4), CaCl2 (1.8), MgCl2 (1), Glucose (10), 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-l-piperazineethanesulphonic acid (HEPES) (10), pH 7.4 with NaOH. The extracellular solution, in the absence or presence of test compound, was contained in reservoirs, from which it flowed into the recording chamber at approximately 0.5 mL/min. The intracellular solution was prepared, aliquoted and stored at -20°C until the day of use. The intracellular solution contained (mM): KC1 (130), MgCla (1), ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether) N,N,N',N'-tetra acetic acid salt (EGTA) (5), MgATP (5), 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-l-piperazineethanesulphonic acid (HEPES) (10), pH 7.2 with KOH. All experiments were performed at room temperature (20-22°C).<br>
The coverslips on which the cells were seeded were transferred to a recording chamber and perfused continuously. Gigaohm seals were formed between the cell and the patch electrode. Once a stable patch was achieved, recording commenced in the voltage clamp mode, with the initial holding potential at -80 mV. After a stable whole-cell current was achieved, the cells were exposed to test compound. The standard voltage protocol was: step from the holding potential of-80 mV to +20 mV for 4.8 sec, repolarize to -50 mV for 5 sec and then return to the original holding potential (-80 mV). This voltage protocol was run once every 15 sec (0.067 Hz). Peak current amplitudes during the repolarization phase were determined using pClamp software. Test compounds at a concentration of 3 µM were perfused over the cells for 5 minutes, followed by a 5-minute washout period in the absence of compound. Finally a positive control (cisapride, 20 nM) was added to the perfusate to test the function of the cell. The step from -80 mV to +20 mV activates the hERG channel, resulting in an outward current. The step back to -50 mV<br>
results in an outward tail current, as the channel recovers from inactivation and deactivates.<br>
Peak current amplitudes during the repolarization phase were determined using pCLAMP software. The control and test article data were exported to Origin® (OriginLab Corp., Northampton MA) where the individual current amplitudes were normalized to the initial current amplitude in the absence of compound. The normalized current means and standard errors for each condition were calculated and plotted versus the time course of the experiment.<br>
Comparisons were made between the observed K+ current inhibitions after the five-minute exposure to either the test article or vehicle control (usually 0.3 % DMSO). Statistical comparisons between experimental groups were performed using a two-population, independent t-test (Microcal Origin v. 6.0). Differences were considered significant at p 
The smaller the percentage inhibition of the potassium ion current in this assay, the smaller the potential for test compounds to change the pattern of cardiac repolarization when used as therapeutic agents. For example, the compounds of Examples 1-14 which were tested in this assay at a concentration of 3 µM exhibited an inhibition of the potassium ion current of less than about 30 %, including, less than about 20 %.<br>
Assay 5: In vitro Model of Oral Bioavailability: Caco-2 Permeation Assay<br>
The Caco-2 permeation assay was performed to model the ability of test compounds to pass through the intestine and get into the blood stream after oral administration. The rate at which test compounds in solution permeate a cell monolayer designed to mimic the tight junction of human small intestinal monolayers was determined.<br>
Caco-2 (colon, adenocarcinoma; human) cells were obtained from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection; Rockville, MD). For the permeation study, cells were seeded at a density of 63,000 cells/cm2 on pre-wetted transwells polycarbonate filters (Costar; Cambridge, MA). A cell monolayer was formed after 21 days in culture. Following cell culture in the transwell plate, the membrane containing the cell monolayer was detached from the transwell plate and inserted into the diffusion chamber (Costar; Cambridge, MA). The diffusion chamber was inserted into the heating block which was equipped with circulating external, thermostatically regulated 37 °C water for temperature<br>
control. The air manifold delivered 95% O2/5% CO2 to each half of a diffusion chamber and created a laminar flow pattern across the cell monolayer, which was effective in reducing the unstirred boundary layer.<br>
The permeation study was performed with test compound concentrations at 100 µM and with14C-mannitol to monitor the integrity of the monolayer. All experiments were conducted at 37 °C for 60 min. Samples were taken at 0, 30 and 60 min from both the donor and receiver sides of the chamber. Samples were analyzed by HPLC or liquid scintillation counting for test compound and mannitol concentrations. The permeation coefficient (Kp) in cm/sec was calculated.<br>
In this assay, a Kp value greater than about 10 x 10"6 cm/sec is considered indicative of favorable bioavailability. Those compounds of the invention which were tested in this assay typically exhibited Kp values of between about 10 x 10"6 cm/sec and about 50 x 10"6 cm/sec.<br>
Assay 6: Pharmacokinetic Study in the Rat<br>
Aqueous solution formulations of test compounds were prepared in 0.1 % lactic acid at a pH of between about 5 and about 6. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (CD strain, Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were dosed with test compounds via intravenous administration (IV) at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg or by oral gavage (PO) at a dose of 5 mg/kg. The dosing volume was 1 mL/kg for IV and 2 mL/kg for PO administration. Serial blood samples were collected from animals pre-dose, and at 2 (TV only), 5, 15, and 30 min, and at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours post-dose. Concentrations of test compounds in blood plasma were determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis (LC-MS/MS) (MDS SCffiX, API 4000, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with a lower limit of quantitation of 1 ng/mL.<br>
Standard pharmacokinetic parameters were assessed by non-compartmental analysis (Model 201 for IV and Model 200 for PO) using WinNonlin (Version 4.0.1, Pharsight, Mountain View, CA). The maximum in the curve of test compound concentration in blood plasma vs. time is denoted Cmax. The area under the concentration vs. time curve from the time of dosing to the last measurable concentration (AUC(O-t)) was calculated by the linear trapezoidal rule. Oral bioavailability (F(%)), i.e. the dose-normalized ratio of AUC(O-t) for PO administration to AUC(O-t) for IV administration, was calculated as:<br>
F(%) = AUCpo/AUCIV x DoseIV/DosePO x 100%<br>
Test compounds which exhibit larger values of the parameters Cmax, AUC(O-t), and F(%) in this assay are expected to have greater bioavailability when administered orally. Preferred compounds of the invention had Cmax values typically ranging from about 0.06 to about 0,8 µg/mL and AUC(O-t) values typically ranging from about 0.14 to about 1.2 µg-hr/mL. By way of example, the compound of Example 1 had a Cmax value of 0.8 µg/mL, an AUC(O-t) value of 1.2 µg-hr/mL and oral bioavailability (F(%)) in the rat model of about 75%.<br>
