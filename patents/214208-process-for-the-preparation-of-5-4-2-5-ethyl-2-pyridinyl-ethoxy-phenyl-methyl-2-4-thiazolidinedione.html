The compound of formula 1 contains both basic nitrogen and acid nitrogen in its<br>
molecule, and can be converted to pharmacologically acceptable salt, when desired,<br>
by	using	a	suitable	acid	or	base.<br>
The acid salts may be mineral salts (e.g. hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulfate, etc.), organic acid salts (e.g. succinate, maleate, fumarate, malate, tartrate, etc.) and sulfonates (e.g. methanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, toluenesulfonate, etc.).
