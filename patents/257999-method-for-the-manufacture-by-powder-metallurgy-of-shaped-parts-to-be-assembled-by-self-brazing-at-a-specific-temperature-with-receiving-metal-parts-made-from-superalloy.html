The present invention concerns a method using powder<br>
metallurgy for producing moulded parts intended to be<br>
assembled by self-brazing to metal parts capable of<br>
receiving them and said receiving parts.<br>
It also concerns a method for assembling such moulded<br>
parts to receiving metal parts.<br>
In the continuation of the present document, the term<br>
"self-brazing" means the autogenous brazing of the moulded<br>
part on the receiving metal part, the elements effecting<br>
brazing being contained in the moulded part.<br>
The operation of self-brazing of the moulded part on<br>
the metal part may comprise or be followed by a diffusion<br>
heat treatment in the solid state, thus constituting what<br>
is commonly termed a brazing-diffusion operation, which<br>
treatment is intended to homogenize the composition and the<br>
structure of the moulded parts and of the area of<br>
connection by self-brazing.<br>
From Patent EP 0 075 497 there is known a method for<br>
assembly by brazing-diffusion of metal parts, such as<br>
components made of superalloy for gas turbines, which<br>
consists in interposing between the surfaces to be<br>
assembled a connecting layer of overall composition<br>
corresponding to a superalloy, and in carrying out a<br>
brazing-diffusion treatment on this assembly.<br>
The connecting layer consists of an intimate mixture<br>
of two alloy powders, the first powder, termed "basic<br>
powder", being a superalloy powder, and the second powder<br>
being a brazing powder of Ni-Co-Si-B alloy the liquidus<br>
temperature of which is below the solidus temperature of<br>
the mechanical parts and of the basic powder.<br>
The relatively low melting temperature of the brazing<br><br>
powder is provided by its content of Si and/or of B.<br>
In the continuation of the present document, the term<br>
"melting element" designates an element such as, by way of<br>
non-limiting example, silicon or boron, which substantially<br>
lowers the solidus temperature of the alloy into which it<br>
is introduced.<br>
The brazing-diffusion operation is carried out at a<br>
temperature such that the brazing powder melts and, flowing<br>
between the basic powder grains, makes it possible to<br>
decrease the porosity very rapidly and to obtain a compact<br>
connecting layer independently of the volume of powder<br>
employed.<br>
The application of the temperature is then maintained<br>
to diffuse the melting element or elements B and Si. The<br>
homogenization of the composition resulting from such<br>
diffusion raises the liquidus temperature of the melted<br>
areas which solidify while the temperature is maintained,<br>
diffusion continuing in the solid state.<br>
The result at the end of the brazing-diffusion<br>
operation is a homogeneous and dense structure with an<br>
absence of discontinuity between the parts to be assembled.<br>
The same document EP 0 07 5 497 gives several examples of application to superalloys based oh nickel or based on<br>
cobalt.<br>
One of the examples concerns the reconditioning of a<br>
fixed turbine blade, made of cobalt-based alloy KC25NW<br>
according to the AFNOR designation, cracked by thermal<br>
fatigue.<br>
For that, a paste containing an intimate mixture of<br>
the basic powder of Co superalloy, the brazing powder of<br>
Ni-Co-Si-B alloy and a volatile binding agent is applied in<br>
the previously cleaned and/or widened crack.<br>
The binding agent of the type consisting of a solution<br>
of acrylic resin in the monomer of the latter is eliminated<br>
by pyrolysis during the brazing-diffusion treatment at<br>
1200Â°C.<br><br>
The document EP 0 075 497 also provides for it being<br>
possible to apply, instead of a paste, a strip or tape<br>
obtained by lamination of an intimate mixture of basic and<br>
brazing powders and of acrylic resin.<br>
Patent EP 0 075 497 also provides for it being<br>
possible to add on an elementary part of simple shape in<br>
the form of a pre-sintered blank obtained from the mixture<br>
of basic and brazing powders, the surface of the pre-<br>
sintered blank acting as the connecting layer.<br>
The patent cites in particular as application the<br>
plugging of hub support holes on hollow turbine blades,<br>
made of alloy NK15CADT according to the AFNOR designation,<br>
coming from the foundry. For that, there is introduced<br>
into the hole a plug consisting of a pre-sintered blank<br>
containing 75% by weight of basic powder of alloy NK17CDAT<br>
according to the AFNOR designation, and 25% by weight of<br>
brazing powder of Ni-Co-Si-B alloy, and self-brazing is<br>
carried out at 1200Â°C for 15 minutes.<br>
The use of the method described in that patent is<br>
nevertheless subject to a certain number of limitations.<br>
The use of pastes or tapes containing, in addition to<br>
the basic and brazing powders, a binding agent which it is<br>
necessary to decompose and the decomposition products of<br>
which must be eliminated during brazing-diffusion, requires<br>
the use of furnaces capable of eliminating large quantities<br>
of gas coming from the pyrolysis of the binding agent.<br>
Such furnaces are poorly suited to the brazing-diffusion<br>
operation which takes placed at around 1200Â°C and generally<br>
under vacuum. <br>
Another problem to be solved is the production of<br>
elementary parts in the form of pre-sintered blanks. The<br>
document EP 0 075 497 does not indicate any method for<br>
producing such blanks and envisages only simple shapes.<br>
The shaping of the blanks may be envisaged by uniaxial<br>
cold compacting, but this method does not make it possible<br>
to produce very slender or thin shapes of homogeneous<br><br>
density because of friction between powder grains or<br>
between grains and walls of the compacting die. Moreover,<br>
in order to limit the friction, lubricants of the zinc stearate type or similar are used as additive to the<br>
powders; these lubricants are capable of introducing zinc<br>
into the blank, this element having a harmful effect on the<br>
service life of the superalloys.<br>
Other methods for shaping the blanks are in fact used,<br>
such as plasma spraying onto a rotating substrate and<br>
cutting of tapes by laser.<br>
Plasma sprayin makes it possible to produce blanks of<br>
tubular shape generated by rotation, by spraying metal<br>
powder onto a rotating cylindrical mandrel. Such a method<br>
has a very low yield, around 90% of the sprayed powder<br>
being sprayed elsewhere than onto the rotating mandrel,<br>
which severely affects the cost of producing the blanks,<br>
taking into account the extremely high cost of the metal<br>
powders sprayed. Furthermore, this method does not ensure<br>
clean edges at the end of the blank, which necessitates re-<br>
cutting and further increases the cost of the parts.<br>
The laser cutting of tapes obtained by slip casting,<br>
elimination of the solvent and sintering, makes it possible<br>
only to obtain relatively thin flat parts. The losses<br>
resulting from the laser cutting, however, are high and<br>
represent 2/3rds of the material employed.<br>
The consolidation of self-brazing pre-sintered blanks obtained by powder metallurgy is described in US Patent<br>
4. 937,042 which concerns the production of fixed facing<br>
friction parts of the fins of gas turbines. The blanks<br>
consist of a mixture of a first superalloy powder of the M-<br>
Cr-Al or M-Cr-Al-Y type not containing Si, and of a second<br>
powder of the M-Cr-Al-Si type containing around 10% by<br>
weight of Si, the element Si being the melting element and<br>
M representing the element Co or the element Ni or a<br>
combination of these two elements. The blanks are pre-<br><br>
sintered at a temperature below the solidus temperature of<br>
the second powder.<br>
The consolidation brought about by such pre-sintering<br>
is very limited, taking into account the low sintering<br>
capacity of the superalloys. The blanks thus obtained are<br>
therefore not easily handled.<br>
An endeavour has been made in the present invention to<br>
produce moulded parts intended to be assembled by self-<br>
brazing to receiving metal parts, the moulded parts being<br>
able to be of very varied and even complex shapes and<br>
having relatively precise dimensional characteristics, and<br>
being obtained by a powder metallurgy method having a high<br>
yield, that is to say, the ratio between the mass of the<br>
moulded part obtained and the mass of metal powders<br>
employed in order to do this is close to 1.<br>
An endeavour has also been made to produce moulded<br>
parts having a controlled relative density close to 1, the<br>
density of which is homogenous in the volume of the part<br>
and containing no harmful elements or "poisons" for the<br>
wear characteristics of these parts.<br>
An endeavour has also been made to produce relatively<br>
slender solid moulded parts the length/width ratio of which<br>
is, for example, at least 5 and relatively thin hollow<br>
moulded parts the diameter/thickness ratio of which is, for<br>
example at least 10.<br>
The subject of the present invention is firstly a<br>
method using powder metallurgy for manufacturing moulded<br>
parts intended to be assembled by self-brazing to receiving<br>
metal parts.<br>
The method employs two metal powders, a first powder<br>
termed "basic powder" making it possible to obtain the<br>
desired metallurgical characteristics, and a second powder<br>
termed "brazing powder" made of alloy including a melting<br>
element at a content such that the liquidus temperature of<br>
the brazing powder is below the solidus temperature of the<br>
basic powder, the basic powder not including in its<br><br>
chemical composition any voluntary addition of melting<br>
element.<br>
The chemical composition of the basic powder may if<br>
necessary be obtained from a mixture of powders.<br>
The chemical composition of the basic powder and that<br>
of the brazing powder make it possible to define a self-<br>
brazing temperature which is higher than the liquidus<br>
temperature of the brazing powder and below the solidus<br>
temperatures of the basic powder and the receiving part.<br>
The method according to the invention comprises the<br>
following sequence of steps:<br>
 a) a homogenous mixture of basic metal powder, brazing powder and a liquid binding agent is prepared.<br>
By binding agent there is understood here a<br>
constituent or a group of constituents making it possible<br>
to bind the metal powder grains to one another to form a<br>
mixture of homogeneous appearance.<br>
The binding agent in the continuation of the present<br>
document may comprise additives intended, for example, to<br>
facilitate the dispersion, the suspension of the metal<br>
powders, or to improve other characteristics of the<br>
mixture.		<br>
The qualifying adjective "liquid" for the binding <br><br>
agent comprises the molten state and corresponds to various consistencies that can be characterized by their viscosity.<br>
The binding agent is selected to be able to gain<br>
consistency when it is desired. By that there is to be<br>
understood assuming a state capable of retaining a shape<br>
contrary, for example, to the liquid state.<br>
b) The mixture thus prepared is injected into a mould of<br>
the moulded part to be produced, while applying an<br>
appropriate pressure to the said mixture.<br><br>
The geometry of the mould is adapted to that of the<br>
moulded parts to be produced, taking into account the<br>
dimensional variations resulting from the method, which<br>
dimensional variations a person skilled in the art is able<br>
to predict from experience or take account of from<br>
preliminary tests.<br>
The moulding is maintained in conditions of<br>
temperature, injection pressure and time such that the<br>
binding agent gains consistency.<br>
c)	Once the binding agent has become consistent, the<br>
moulded blank is removed from the mould.<br>
d)	The binding agent is eliminated from the moulded blank<br>
by a known appropriate means or combination of means such<br>
as, for example, physical, thermal or chemical means. This<br>
step is termed "binding agent elimination" and the blank<br>
which emerges from it is termed "with binding agent<br>
eliminated".<br>
e)	The blank with binding agent eliminated is subjected<br>
to a sintering treatment intended to densify it to a<br>
relative density of at least 95%,sintering being carried<br>
out at a temperature higher than the liquidus temperature<br>
of the brazing powder but below the temperature of the<br>
subsequent self-brazing treatment.<br>
The condition regarding the minimum sintering<br>
temperature makes it possible to ensure the sintering in<br>
the liquid phase necessary for obtaining moulded parts<br>
having a relative density close to unity, even in the case<br>
of basic powders having a low sintering capacity, a high<br>
density after sintering making it possible to limit<br>
dimensional changes during self-brazing.<br>
The condition regarding the maximum sintering<br>
temperature makes it possible to ensure the formation of a<br><br>
sufficient quantity of liquid phase during self-brazing to<br>
assemble the moulded part reliably to the receiving part.<br>
The self-brazing conditions themselves are known to a<br>
person skilled in the art of this type of assembly. <br>
The sequence of steps of the method of the invention,<br>
namely, preparation of an injectable mixture, moulding,<br>
extraction, elimination of the binding agent and sintering,<br>
corresponds schematically to those of a method for<br>
injection moulding of powdery metallic materials, which<br>
method is designated by MIM, an abbreviation of "metal<br>
injectionâmoulding".<br>
Variants of such MIM methods are described for example in the patents US 4,197,118, WO 88/07902 and WO 88/07903. <br>
The MIM techniques described in those patents filed 10<br>
to 20 years ago are used to produce finished parts having<br>
a relative density very close to unity, and a person<br>
skilled in the art was until now in no way incited to<br>
transpose these techniques to obtain components having<br>
characteristics opposed to the characteristics associated<br>
with the products resulting from the MIM techniques, the<br>
products obtained by the method of the invention being<br>
"semi-finished", not completely densified and intended to<br>
undergo partial fusion when they are made use of.<br>
Advantageously, but not exclusively, the method of the<br>
invention applies to basic metal powders of superalloys<br>
based on Ni, Co or Fe. The brazing powder is then an alloy<br>
of Ni, Co or Fe in which the melting element is Si, B or<br>
both these elements at the same time. <br>
Preferably, the brazing powder contains, in the case<br>
where the element Si is used alone or in combination as<br>
melting element, 2 to 12% by weight of Si.<br>
Preferably, in the case where the element B is used<br>
alone or in combination as melting element, the brazing<br>
powder contains 1 to 5% by weight of B.<br>
Preferably, the alloy of the brazing powder is<br>
selected from the following list of alloys: Ni-Si, Ni-B,<br><br>
Ni-Co-Si, Ni-Co-B, Ni-Co-Si-B, Ni-Cr-Al-Si, Ni-Co-Cr-Al-Si,<br>
Ni-Cr-B, Ni-Co-Cr-B.<br>
In the alloy of the brazing powder, the unspecified<br>
elements are present in their customary content, taking<br>
into account the base materials used and the methods for<br>
preparation of the alloy.<br>
Preferably, the percentage by weight of brazing powder<br>
in relation to the whole of the two metal powders is<br>
between 5 and 40% and depends on the nature of the two<br>
powders.<br>
Preferably again, the charge of metal powders is at<br>
least 50% by volume in the mixture produced with the<br>
binding agent.<br>
As indicated above, different variants of the MIM<br>
method may advantageously be employed in the method of the<br>
invention.<br>
The mechanism of gain of consistency of the blank in<br>
the mould may, according to a first variant of the method<br>
of the invention, be a physical liquid-solid change of<br>
state of the binding agent obtained by maintaining the<br>
mould at a temperature below the temperature of said change<br>
of state.	<br>
The temperature of the mould is of course selected<br>
such as to produce the solidification of the binding agent<br>
in spite of any possible supercooling phenomena and while<br>
taking account of the influence of the presence of any<br>
additives in the binding agent. <br>
According to a sub-variant of this first variant of<br>
the method of the invention, the binding agent may be or<br>
comprise a thermoplastic resin, the binding agent/metal<br>
powders mixture then being prepared at a temperature higher<br>
than the melting temperature of the binding agent and<br>
injected into the mould also at a temperature higher than<br>
this melting temperature.<br>
According to another sub-variant of this first variant<br>
of the method of the invention, the binding agent may be an<br><br>
aqueous or non-aqueous system liquid at ambient<br>
temperature, and the mixture prepared with the metal<br>
powders is injected into a mould cooled to a temperature<br>
below the solidification temperature of the binding agent.<br>
The step of elimination of the binding agent in this<br>
sub-variant comprises an operation of lyophilization or<br>
sublimation of the binding agent.<br>
According to another variant of the method of the<br>
invention, the binding agent is a thermosetting resin and<br>
the mechanism of gain of consistency of the binding agent<br>
is an accelerated polymerisation of the resin, for example<br>
in a heated mould.<br>
According to yet another variant of the method of the<br>
invention, the binding agent is capable of a sol-gel<br>
reaction which is employed during the moulding step. The<br>
step of elimination of the binding agent then comprises an<br>
operation of putting the binding agent, or its essential<br>
constituents, back into solution.<br>
Advantageously, in these different variants of the<br>
method of the invention, the step of elimination of the<br>
binding agent may comprise an operation of putting into<br>
solution at least one component of the binding agent by the<br>
chemical action of a solvent of the component or<br>
components.<br>
When the binding agent comprises a polymer, the step<br>
of elimination of the binding agent may advantageously<br>
comprise an operation of depolymerisation of said polymer<br>
by the chemical and/or catalytic action of a specific<br>
agent.<br>
Again advantageously, the step of elimination of the<br>
binding agent may comprise more than one operation, the<br>
final operation being an operation of thermal elimination<br>
of the binding agent.<br>
Very advantageously in this case, the operation of<br>
thermal elimination of the binding agent continues up to a<br>
temperature ensuring the start of consolidation or "pre-<br><br>
sintering" of the metal powders. This pre-sintering makes<br>
it possible to handle the blanks with binding agent<br>
eliminated, without risk of breakage, before subjecting<br>
them to the sintering step intended to densify them.<br>
In the continuation of the present document, the term<br>
"sintering" is reserved for the operation which transforms<br>
the "blanks" with binding agent eliminated into low<br>
porosity self-brazing moulded parts knowing that, during<br>
self-brazing, the physical process of sintering and<br>
elimination of the residual porosity continues in the<br>
moulded parts.<br>
Preferably, in order to permit the pre-sintering of<br>
the blanks with binding agent eliminated, the thermal<br>
elimination of the binding agent is terminated at a<br>
temperature within the melting range of the brazing powder<br>
and very preferably in the lower half of the range.<br>
Still more preferably, the sintering step is carried<br>
out at a temperature approximately 50Â°C below that of the<br>
subseguent self-brazing operation.<br>
Optionally, the operation of thermal elimination of<br>
the binding agent and the sintering step may be carried out<br>
successively in the same furnace without a return to<br>
ambient temperature between these two operations or steps.<br>
The moulded parts obtained after sintering have very<br>
regular dimensions which reguire little or no dimensional<br>
retouching by machining to be able to fit the receiving<br>
parts and produce a solid self-brazed assembly.<br>
Owing to the forced elimination of the binding agent<br>
during binding agent elimination, the moulded parts<br>
resulting from the method of the invention do not contain<br>
any chemical element other than those which constitute the<br>
metal powders employed.<br>
The present invention also covers a method of assembly<br>
of the self-brazing moulded parts, obtained by the<br>
manufacturing method according to the invention, to<br>
receiving parts which are superalloy components of<br><br><br>
aeronautic or land gas turbines.<br><br>
According to this method of assembly, the alloy of<br>
which the basic powder consists is selected for its<br>
compatibility with the superalloy of the receiving parts,<br>
and the moulded part is pre-assembled to the receiving part<br>
by arranging it in contact with or at a small clearance<br>
from the receiving part. This may impose known conditions<br>
regarding the shape and dimensions of the moulded part and<br>
of the facing portions of the receiving part.<br>
The pre-assembly between these two parts is then<br>
brought to a temperature higher than the liquidus<br>
temperature of the brazing powder and below the solidus<br>
temperature of the basic powder and of the receiving part<br>
in order to carry out self-brazing.<br>
Preferably, and in particular during the application<br>
of the method to the repair of parts, the self-brazing<br>
treatment is followed directly, or after returning to<br>
ambient temperature, by a diffusion treatment intended to<br>
diffuse the chemical elements, and especially the melting<br>
element or elements, and to homogenize the structure of the<br>
repaired area.<br>
The following figures illustrate in a non-limiting<br>
manner an example of a moulded part and examples of<br>
implementation of the manufacturing and assembly methods of<br>
the invention.<br>
Figure 1 shows a self-brazing moulded part of the<br>
annular bush type made of superalloy.<br>
Figure 2 is a diagram of the steps of a first variant<br>
of the manufacturing method according to the invention of<br>
the bush in Figure 1, which variant employs a thermoplastic<br>
resin.<br>
Figure 3 is a diagram of the steps of a second variant<br>
of the manufacturing method according to the invention of<br>
the bush in Figure 1, which variant also employs a<br>
thermoplastic resin.<br>
Figure 4 is a diagram of the steps of a third variant<br><br>
of the manufacturing method according to the invention of<br>
the bush in Figure 1, which variant employs a binding agent<br>
liguid at ambient temperature.<br>
Figure 1 shows a tubular self-brazing bush 1 made of<br>
nickel-based superalloy.<br>
Its outside diameter D is of the order of 12 mm and<br>
its thickness e of the order of 0.6 mm. It is therefore a<br>
thin part with a high D/e ratio, of the order of 20. Its<br>
height h is of the order of 10 mm.<br>
Since the bush is intended to be self-brazed in a<br>
blind hole of an aeronautic gas turbine blade made of<br>
superalloy having the commercial designation Rene 77 (Ni<br>
alloy of type NK15CDAT) , the tolerance on its outside<br>
diameter is very tight, of the order of a few hundredths of<br>
a mm, so as to centre the bush perfectly, to limit its<br>
geometric distortions during self-brazing and to facilitate<br>
its connection to the receiving part, i.e. the turbine<br>
blade.<br>
The bush 1 is made of nickel-based superalloy by the<br>
powder metallurgy method according to the invention by<br>
means of two metal powders, a basic powder A and a brazing<br>
powder B.<br>
The basic powder A is a known alloy powder having the<br>
commercial designation Astroloy (NK17CDAT according to the<br>
AFNOR designation). This material is completely compatible<br>
with the Rene 77 superalloy of the blade, especially from<br>
the point of view of solidus temperature and mechanical<br>
characteristics.<br>
The solidus temperature of the basic powder A is<br>
1240Â°C. Its liquidus temperature is 1280Â°C.<br>
The brazing powder B used to carry out the sintering<br>
of the Astroloy powder and self-brazing with the blade is<br>
an Ni-Co-Si-B alloy powder containing, by weight, 17% Co,<br>
4% Si, 2.7% B.<br>
The solidus temperature of the brazing powder B is<br>
965Â°C. Its liquidus temperature is 1065Â°C and is below the<br><br>
solidus temperatures of the basic powder A and of the<br>
blade.<br>
These data make it possible to define a self-brazing<br>
temperature of 1200Â°C which is higher than the liquidus<br>
temperature of the brazing powder but which is below the<br>
solidus temperature of the blade made of Rene 77 and that<br>
of the Astroloy powder A.<br>
Figure 2 describes a first variant of implementation<br>
of the method according to the invention.<br>
The two metal powders A and B are powders with<br>
spherical grains atomized with argon and their particle<br>
size grading is 53 Âµm or less.<br>
The two metal powders A and B are pre-mixed with one<br>
another under an inert atmosphere. The pre-mixing of the<br>
two metal powders A and B is designated by (A+B).<br>
The proportion by weight of Astroloy powder A to the<br>
brazing powder B is 3:1, which corresponds to a percentage<br>
by weight of 25% of powder B in the pre-mix (A+B) of the<br>
two metal powders.<br>
According to this first variant, a paste-like mixture<br>
is prepared from the two pre-mixed metal powders (A+B) with<br>
a binding agent L melted at around 180Â°C in a mixer under<br>
inert gas.<br>
The binding agent L consists of a mixture of wax C and<br>
of thermoplastic resin R, for example of the polyethylene<br>
or polypropylene type.<br>
The charge by volume of metal powders (A+B) in the<br>
mixture is 70%.<br>
The homogeneous mixture obtained is cooled and ground<br>
to constitute granulates.<br>
The granulates obtained may be handled and stored<br>
without any problem at ambient temperature, the grains of<br>
metal powders being coated with solidified binding agent.<br>
In the following step of injection moulding, the<br>
granulates are introduced into the Archimedean screw of a<br>
press of the type for injection moulding objects made of<br><br>
synthetic material, the Archimedean screw being heated to<br>
around 180-200Â°C so as to melt the binding agent of the<br>
granulates and to obtain a metallic paste, the viscosity of<br>
which is between 10' and 107 cpoise and which is therefore<br>
suitable for being injected by the Archimedean screw into<br>
a mould.<br>
The mould, produced from tool steel, is composed of<br>
two parts bearing one upon the other by a joining plane,<br>
the two parts, when they are placed upon one the other,<br>
delimiting an annular cavity or impression into which the<br>
metallic paste is injected by means of the Archimedean<br>
screw.<br>
The dimensions of the impression of the mould are<br>
those of the bush to be produced except for a coefficient,<br>
the blank undergoing dimensional variations during the<br>
subsequent manufacturing operations, especially shrinkage<br>
during sintering.<br>
In the case of the bushes in Figure 1, the impression<br>
therefore has dimensions equal to 1.15 x those of the bush.<br>
The shrinkage may not be isotropic; to define the<br>
dimensions of the mould, different shrinkage coefficients<br>
are then applied according to the directions.<br>
A person skilled in the art can predict these<br>
dimensional variations, if necessary by means of some<br>
preliminary tests intended to take into account the<br>
influence in particular of the characteristics of the metal<br>
powders and of the binding agent used, of the charge of<br>
metal powders in the mixture, and of the sintering<br>
conditions.<br>
The mould is maintained at the temperature of the<br>
order of 45Â°C to permit both correct filling of the<br>
impression and the solidification of the metallic paste in<br>
about 1 minute.<br>
 Once the blank has solidified, the two parts of the<br>
mould are separated and the blank is extracted from the<br>
impression.<br><br>
The construction of the mould should take into account<br>
the constraint of being able to extract the moulded blanks<br>
without damaging them, but taking into account such a<br>
constraint is known in the field of injection moulding.<br>
The following step of the method according to Figure<br>
2 is the elimination of the binding agent, which is carried<br>
out in two successive operations.<br>
A first operation is chemical binding agent<br>
elimination, DCS, by the action of a solvent which is<br>
hexane and which dissolves the wax of the binding agent.<br>
This binding agent elimination is carried out in the vapour<br>
phase and in the liquid phase by immersion.<br>
The second operation of binding agent elimination<br>
carried out is thermal binding agent elimination, DT, in a<br>
furnace under a hydrogen atmosphere.<br><br>
This second operation first comprises a rise and then<br>
maintaining around 400-500Â°C where pyrolysis of the<br>
thermoplastic resin not dissolved by the hexane takes<br>
place.<br>
Pyrolysis in a hydrogenated medium leaves almost no<br>
residue of the binding agent.<br>
The blank is extremely porous at that moment, the<br>
pores occupying the volume left free by the departure of<br>
the binding agent. The grains of metal powders have only<br>
a low cohesion between them, which means that the blank is<br>
sensitive to shocks and is not easily handled.<br>
The temperature is then raised in the thermal binding<br>
agent elimination furnace to 1000Â°C in order to carry out<br>
pre-sintering of the blanks with binding agent eliminated.<br>
At this temperature, higher than the solidus temperature of<br>
the brazing powder B (965Â°C) and located at l/3rd of its<br>
melting range, the powder B melts partially and the liquid<br>
phase from B infiltrates the surface of the unmelted powder grains, especially those of the basic powder A, forming<br>
metallic bridges between the grains and thereby effecting<br>
the consolidation of the structure.<br><br>
The blanks are maintained at 1000Â°C for around 10<br>
minutes, then cooled to ambient temperature.<br>
Pre-sintering at a lower temperature, slightly below<br>
the solidus temperature of the brazing powder B, for<br>
example at 950Â°C, would not permit the formation of metallic<br>
bridges and the blanks would be too fragile to be able to<br>
be handled subsequently, taking into account their very<br>
slight thickness, less than a mm.<br>
Pre-sintering at a temperature higher than 1000Â°C would<br>
result in the formation of too much liquid phase at the<br>
pre-sintering stage.<br>
A relatively slow rise to 1000Â°C also contributes to<br>
the quality of the pre-sintering. A speed of the rise of the order of 500Â°C/hour gives satisfactory results.<br>
After this operation of thermal elimination of the<br>
binding agent, the blanks are introduced into the sintering<br>
furnace, which is a vacuum furnace.<br>
Sintering is carried out by a rise in stages to 800Â°C,<br>
then by a rise to 1150Â°C, or a temperature above the<br>
liquidus temperature of the brazing powder B and 50Â°C below<br>
the temperature envisaged for the self-brazing of the<br>
bushes on the blade made of Rene 77.<br>
The bushes are maintained at 1150Â°C for 15 minutes.<br>
These conditions are sufficient to obtain forced<br>
densification of the parts to more than 96% while retaining<br>
sufficient potential for formation of the liquid phase<br>
during self-brazing.<br>
After cooling to ambient temperature, accelerated by<br>
 the introduction of argon into the furnace, the annular<br>
bushes are checked and if necessary retouched by<br>
rectification if, in particular, their outside diameter is<br>
too large for their use. <br>
Figure 3 describes a second variant for manufacturing<br>
the annular bushes in Figure 1.<br>
A homogeneous mixture is prepared from the same two<br>
metal powders (A+B) pre-mixed with a melted binding agent<br><br>
L which this time consists of a thermoplastic resin,<br>
polyacetal, the charge of metal powders being 65% by volume<br>
in the mixture. The mixture is granulated as in the first<br>
variant.<br>
As in the first variant, the granulates are heated<br>
until the binding agent melts and are injected into the<br>
mould of an injection moulding press.<br>
After their extraction from the mould, the solidified<br>
moulded blanks undergo catalytic binding agent elimination,<br>
 DCa, at 110Â°C by means of gaseous HNO3. <br>
 This agent depolymerizes the polyacetal which is<br>
transformed into a gaseous monomer, formaldehyde, which is<br>
evacuated.<br>
This step of catalytic elimination of the binding<br>
agent makes it possible to eliminate the binding agent<br>
almost completely, the operation of thermal elimination of<br>
the binding agent therefore being rendered unnecessary.<br>
The blank with binding agent eliminated is then directly sintered in a furnace under vacuum at 1150Â°C as for<br>
the first variant.<br>
Figure 4 describes a third variant for manufacturing<br>
the annular bushes in Figure 1.<br>
This time, a mixture is prepared from the same metal<br>
powders (A+B) pre-mixed with a binding agent L which is<br>
liquid at ambient temperature.<br>
The binding agent L may be an aqueous or non-aqueous<br>
system.<br>
In the case where an aqueous system is used, the major<br>
constituent of the binding agent is water, additives to the<br>
water improving the dispersion and the suspension of the<br>
metal powder grains, making it possible to condition the<br>
viscosity of the mixture at ambient temperature or having<br>
a cryo-protective role. Patent Application WO 88/07902<br>
describes such aqueous systems.<br>
The metallic slip thus constituted with the aqueous<br>
system L and a charge of the order of 60% of metal powders<br><br>
(A+B) has a viscosity of between 103 and 104 cpoise and may<br>
be conserved in closed receptacles before injection<br>
moulding.<br>
The injection moulding operation is then carried out<br>
in a mould made of tool steel cooled to -40Â°C or to a lower<br>
temperature.<br>
Patent EP 587 483 describes a press for injecting such<br>
slips and in particular the injection head of the press. Patent EP 626 224 describes a device for carrying out<br>
the moulding of such slips at temperatures below ambient<br>
temperature without causing frosting of the surface of the<br>
impression or of the joining plane of the mould.<br>
The use of a non-aqueous system as an alternative to<br>
an aqueous system is described in Patent Application WO<br>
88/07903.<br>
It is possible, for example, to use cyclohexane with<br>
additives such as a dispersant for dispersing the metal<br>
powders, and a colloid for conditioning the viscosity of<br>
the mixture.<br>
The mould is in this case maintained at a temperature<br>
of the order of -20Â°C.<br>
Whether the binding agent L is an aqueous system or a<br>
non-aqueous system, the metallic ice blocks extracted from<br>
the mould after solidification of the slip are kept at a<br>
low temperature and then the binding agent is eliminated in<br>
two operations.<br>
The first operation of elimination of the binding<br>
agent is a known lyophilization operation, the water or the<br>
cyclohexane being eliminated by sublimation during this<br>
operation.<br>
The second operation of elimination of the binding<br>
agent is a thermal binding agent elimination which makes it<br>
possible to burn the additives to the water or to the<br>
cyclohexane which have not been eliminated during<br>
lyophilization.<br>
The thermal binding agent elimination is conducted in<br><br>
the same manner as in the case of the variant of Figure 2,<br>
and also makes it possible to pre-sinter the blanks<br>
obtained by finally rising to 1000Â°C.<br>
The sintering step is also carried out in the same<br>
manner as for the variant of Figure 2.<br>
The method for manufacturing self-brazing moulded<br>
parts according to the invention is not of course limited<br>
to the variants described above.<br>
The results obtained on the annular bush in Figure 1<br>
manufactured according to the invention by the variant of<br>
Figure 2 are as follows:<br>
Absolute density of the sintered bush : 7.83, or a<br>
relative density of 98%.<br>
Carbon content of the bush = 0.03%,<br>
Grain size = nÂ°6.5 according to specification ASTM<br>
E112,<br>
Typical deviation on inside diameter = 0.01 mm,<br>
Mean deviation of circularity on inside diameter.<br>
The deviation of circularity is taken as equal to the<br>
difference between maximum diameter and minimum diameter<br>
over a same section.<br>
The mean deviation is taken as equal to the average of the<br>
deviations over a same batch of parts.<br>
The mean deviation of circularity on the inside diameter<br>
measured at 25% of the height of the bush is 0.02 mm.<br>
The mean deviation of circularity on the inside diameter<br>
measured at 75% of the height of the bush is 0.03 mm.<br>
A rapid description will now be given of the method of<br>
assembly according to the invention by means of the same<br>
example.<br>
There is produced in the turbine blade made of Rene 77<br>
superalloy a bore of very precise diameter, with a<br>
tolerance of a few hundredths of a mm, for example, and the<br>
outside diameter of the bush in Figure 1 is retouched if<br>
necessary to allow it to be force-fitted into the bore of<br>
the blade.<br><br>
This force-fit pre-assembly is then brought under<br>
vacuum to 1200Â°C, maintained at this temperature for 15<br>
minutes, then cooled to ambient temperature.<br>
The quality of the assembly obtained can then be<br>
checked.<br>
It is also possible to carry out a diffusion treatment<br>
in the solid state for 2 hours at 1200Â°C, either in the<br>
self-bra2ing furnace or subsequently after a return to<br>
ambient temperature.<br>
Finally, a quality heat treatment can be carried out<br>
on the assembly produced.<br><br>
