to the garnish-side-portion fixing hole 69 of the cross member<br>
  61 by threadedly inserting the screw 85 which constitutes the<br><br>
fastening member into a washer 86 accommodated in the garnish fixing portion 77 from behind. The screw 85 is invisible from a front side of the motorcycle and hence, the garnish 26 can provide an aesthetic appearance to the motorcycle 10.<br>
[0054]<br>
On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 21 and Fig. 22, the air cleaner casing 47 forms a pair of plate-like hooks 93 for fixing a starter magnet 92 on a right plate 91 thereof. Accordingly, the starter magnet 92 can be arranged on a portion of the air cleaner casing 47 where a cool wind relatively flows as an electrical component of the engine 18 and hence, it is possible to avoid troubles such as overheating of the engine.<br>
[0055]<br>
Further, on a body portion 94 of the drum cover 43 which covers the throttle valve 37, a triangular frame-like guide portion 95 is formed in a projecting manner, and the drain hose 45 and the breather hose 46 pass through the inside of the guide portion 95. Accordingly, it is possible to prevent the drain hose 4 5 and the breather hose 46 from being damaged due to a contact with other accessories.<br>
[0056]<br>
As shown in Fig. 23, Fig. 24 (A) and Fig. 24 (B) , the side<br>
cover 42 forms a pair of cylindrical fixing portions 96<br>
respectively on a front portion thereof.  The side cover 42<br>
I  is fixed to a bracket 97 which is fixed to a lower surface of<br><br>
the fuel tank 16 by threadedly inserting screws 99 into the respective fixing portions 96 from an inner side by way of a joint 98 which is rotatably mounted on the bracket 97. The joint 98 includes a pair of screw holes 101 on both sides of a rotation support projection 100. The screw holes 101 are formed by molding using projecting portions which are respectively formed on an upper mold and a lower mold not shown in the drawing asymmetrically.<br>
[0057]<br>
In the screen mounting structure of a motorcycle explained heretofore, the screw 85 is arranged below the wrap-around portion 83 of the screen 25 and hence, the rider who is the driver cannot directly see the screw 85 whereby the aesthetic appearance is enhanced. Further, the wrap-around portion 83 of the screen 25 and the upper frame of the cowl 24 are combined to form an upper end of a wind shield and hence, the rigidity of the screen 25 is increased thus suppressing the vibrations of the screen 25. Accordingly, it is possible to realize the structure which conceals the mounting portion of the screen 25 from the rider and the reduction of vibrations of the screen 25.<br>
[0058]<br>
Further, in the above-mentioned screen mounting structure of a motorcycle, the upper portion of the screen 25 is rigidly fixed and the lower portion of the screen 25 is<br><br>
resiliently fixed by the resilient member 84 and hence, the generation of  strain  in the  screen 25  can be prevented.<br>
[0059]<br>
Further, in the above-mentioned screen mounting structure of a motorcycle, in asseinbling the screen 25, the screen 25 can be temporarily mounted by fastening the center projection 79 of the screen 25 on the garnish 26 and the cowl<br>
24	in common and hence, assembling of the garnish 26, the screen<br>
25	and the cowl 24 can be easily performed.<br>
[0060]<br>
Further, in the above-mentioned screen mounting structure of a motorcycle, in assembling the screen 25, the screen 25 can be temporarily mounted by inserting the projecting plate 80 of the screen 25 (see Fig, 8) between the garnish 26 and the cowl 24 and hence, the gap between the screen 25 an the garnish 2 6 can be held at a fixed value thus contributing the appearance quality. Further, assembling of the garnish 2 6, the screen 25 and the cowl 24 can be easily performed,<br>
[0061]<br>
Further, in the above-mentioned screen mounting structure of a motorcycle, the notch receiving portions 87 formed on the left and right end portions of the garnish 26 are hooked on the cowl 24 and hence, it is possible to prevent the end portion A of the garnish 26 shown in Fig, 6 from floating<br><br>
from the cowl 24. Further, the garnish 26 can be temporarily mounted on the cowl 24 and hence, assembling of the garnish 26 and the cowl 24 can be performed easily.<br>
[0062]<br>
Further, in the above-mentioned screen mounting structure of a motorcycle, the garnish 26 and the cowl 24 are fastened in common using the common fastening pro j ecting plates 82 formed on the end portions of the screen 25 and hence, the rigidity of the assembled structure of the screen 25, the garnish 2 6 and the cowl 24 can enhanced.<br>
[0063]<br>
Further, in the above-mentioned screen mounting structure of a motorcycle, the inner panel 28 covers the stay mounting portion 67 with the stay member 29 from behind and hence, the stay mounting portion 67 is covered with and concealed by the inner panel 2 8 whereby the aesthetic appearance of the motorcycle can be enhanced.
