In the process aryl methyl ketones of formula 1 are reacted with haloacetate such as ethyl bromoacetate, ethyl chloroacetate and Zn in presence of catalytic amount of 12 in an aprotic organic solvent such as benzene,toluene,diethyl ether to gove beta-lrydroxyesters of formula 2.<br>
These beta-hydroxyesters can be isolated and purified by standard laboratory   methods such as column        chromatography     or can be used without purification      in the next<br>
step. p-Hydroxyesters of formula   2   are   new compounds and they have   not   been prepared earlier.<br>
In the process dehydration of p-hydroxyesters of formula 2 may be effected in aprotic organic solvent such as benzene, toluene, CH2C12 in presence of a dehydrating agent such as I2, p-toluene sulfonic acid or P2O3 to give α,ß-unsaturated esters of formula 3.

The α,ß-unsaturated esters of formula 3 are new compounds and they have not been prepared earlier.<br>
In the process reduction of α,ß-unsaturated esters of formula 3 is effected with a complex metal hydride such as LiAlH4 in an ether solvent such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, to give allylic alcohols of formula 4. These allylic alcohols of formula 4 can be isolated and purified by standard laboratory methods such as crystallization or column chromatography on silica gel. The allylic alcohols of formula 4 are new compounds and they have not been prepared earlier.<br>
In the process photooxygenation of allylic alcohols of formula 4 may be effected by passing oxygen gas or air in the solution of alcohol in an organic solvent and in the presence of a dye and a light source which provides visible light for a period in the range of 2 to 15 h, to give p.-hydroxyhydroperoxides of formula 5. These p-hydroxyhydroperoxides of formula 5 which are new chemical entities can be isolated and purified by standard laboratory methods such as crystallization or column chromatography or can be used in situ, without purification, in the next step. The dye which acts as a sensitizer i.e. converts 3O2 to highly reactive lO2 may be selected from methylene blue, rose bengal, tetraphenylporphine and the like. Organic solvent used may be selected from CH2C12, benzene, CH3CN, ethanol and the like.<br>
In the process reaction of ß-hydroxyhydroperoxides of formula 5 with aldehydes/ketones of formula 6 is done in an aprotic solvent in the presence of an acid catalyst to give trioxanes of formula 7. The aldehydes and ketones used may be such as isobutyraldehyde, benzaldehyde, p-fluorobenzaldehyde, acetone, ethyl methyl ketone, methyl    propyl    ketone,      cyclopentanone, cyclohexanone,    bicyclic ketone such as<br>
norcomphor and tricyclic ketone such as 2-adamantanone. The acid catalyst used may be such as HCl, H2SO4, p-toluenesulfonic acid, acidic resin like Amberlyst-15. The aprotic organic solvent used may be such as CH2C12, CHC13, benzene, CH3CN. These trioxanes of formula 7 can be isolated and purified by standard laboratory methods such as column chromatography and crystallization. These trioxanes are new chemical entities and they have not been prepared earlier. Some of the trioxanes of formula 7 have been tested against malarial parasites in mice and show promising antimalarial activity.<br>

Antimalarial Activity<br>
The   antimalarial activity of the test compounds   was evaluated   in rodent using multidrug resistant  strain  of Plasmodium yoelii Mgeriensis in Swiss mice.<br>
General Procedure : Random bred swiss mice of either sex (20 ± 2 gm) were inoculated intraperitoneally with 1 x 103 P. yoelii (MDR) parasites on day zero. The treatment with test compounds were administered to groups of 6 mice each at different dose levels ranging between 24-96 mg/kg/day. The treatment was administered via intramuscular route for 4 consecutive days (day 0-3).<br>
Blood smears from experimental mice were observed on day 4 and 7, day 10 and thereafter at regular interval till day 28 or death of the animal. The parasitaemia level on day 4 was compared with the vehicle control group and the percent suppression of parasitaemia in treated groups was calculated.<br>
For determing the curative dose of a compound the treated mice were observed till day 28. The dose at which no parasitaemia develop during the observation period has been recorded as the curative dose. The antimalarial data is summarized in Table-4.<br>
