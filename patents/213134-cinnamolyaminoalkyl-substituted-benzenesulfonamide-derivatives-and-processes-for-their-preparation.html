CINNAMOYIJ’LMINOALKYL-SUBSTITUTED BENZENESULFONANODE DERIVATIVES<br>
The present invention relates to cinnamoylaminoalkyl-substituted benzenesulfonamide derivatives of the fonnula I<br><br>
in which A(1), A(2), A(3), R(1), R(2), R(3), R(4), X, Y and Z have the meanings indicated below. The compounds of the formula I are valuable pharmaceutical active compounds which exhibit, for example, an inhibitory action on ATP-sensitive potassium channels in the cardiac muscle.and/or-in the cardiac netye and are suitable, for example, for the treatment of disorders of the cardiovascular system such as coronary heart disease, arrhythmias, cardiac insufficiency or cardiomyopathies, or for the prevention of sudden cardiac death or for improving decreased contractility of the heart. The invention furthermore relates to processes for the preparation of the compounds of the formula I, their use and pharmaceutical preparations comprising them.<br>
A hypoglycemic action is described for certain benzenesulfonylureas. Glibenciamide, which is used therapeutically as an agent for the treatment of diabetes mellitus, counts as a prototype of hypoglycemic sulfonylureas of this type. Glibenciamide blocks ATP-sensitive potassium channels and is used in research as a tool for the exploration of potassium channels of this type. In addition to its hypoglycemic action, glibenciamide additionally possesses other actions which are attributed to the blockade of precisely these ATP-sensitive potassium channels, which as yet, however, still cannot be utilized therapeutically. These include, in particular, an antifibrillatory action on the heart, in the treatment of ventricular fibrillation or its eariy<br><br>
stages with giibenclamide, however, the marked hypoglycemia simultaneously produced by this substance would be undesirable or even dangerous, as it can further worsen the condition of the patient.<br>
Various patent applications, for example US-A-5698596, US-A-5476850 or US-A-5652268 and WO-A-00/03978 (German Patent Application 19832009.4), disclose antifibrillatory benzenesulfonyjureas and -thioureas having decreased hypoglycemic action. WO-A-00/15204 (German Patent Application 19841534.6) describes the action of some of these compounds on the autonomic nen/ous system. The properties of these compounds, however, are not satisfactory in various respects, and there furthermore exists a need for compounds having a more favorable pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic property profile, which are better suited, in particular, to the treatment of a disturbed heart rhythm and its consequences. Various benzenesulfonylureas having an acylaminoalkyi substituent in which the acyl group can also be derived, inter alia, from cinnamic acids, are disclosed in German Laid-Open Specifications DE-A-1443878,.DE-A-1518816, DE-A-1518877 and DE-A-1545810. These compounds have a hypoglycemic action, but an action on the heart is not known as yet. Surprisingly, it has now been found that certain cinnamoylaminoalkyl-substituted benzenesulfonamide derivatives are distinguished by a marked action on ATP-sensitive potassium channels in the heart and further advantageous pharmacological actions.<br><br><br>

If groups, residues, substituents or variables can occur several times in the compounds of the formula I, they can all independently of one another have the meanings indicated and can in each case be identical or different.<br>
The term alkyl denotes straight-chain or branched saturated hydrocarbon residues. This also applies to residues derived therefrom such as, for example, alkoxy, alkoxycarbonyl or the residue -S(0)m-alkyl. Examples of alkyl residues are methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl, n-pentyl, 1-methylbutyl, isopentyl, neopentyl, tert-pentyl, n-hexyl orisohexyi. Examples of alkoxy are methoxy, ethoxy, n-propoxy, isopropoxy, tert-butoxy etc. The same applies to substituted alkyl residues, for example phenyl-alkyi- residues, or to divalent alkyl residues (alkanediyl residues), in which the substituents or the bonds via which the residues are bonded to the neighboring groups can be situated in any desired positions. Examples of alkyl residues of this type, which are bonded to two neighboring grcxups and which, inter alta, can represent the gYoup Y, are -CH2-,       ' -CH(CH3K -C(CH3)2-, -CH2-CH2-. -CH(CH3)-CH2- -CH2-CH(CH3K -CH2-CH2-CH2- or -CH2-CH2-CH2"CH2".<br>
Aikenyl and alkynyl denote straight-chain or branched, mono- or polyunsaturated hydrocarbon residues, in which the double bonds and/or triple bonds can be situated in any desired positions. Preferably, the residues aikenyl and alkynyl contain one double bond or one triple bond. Examples of aikenyl and alkynyl are vinyl, prop-2-enyl (allyl), prop-1-enyl, but-2-enyi, but-3-eny!, 3-methylbut-2-enyl, pent-2,4-dienyl, ethynyl, prop-2-ynyl (propargyl), prop-1-yny(, but-2-ynyl and but-3-ynyl. In substituted aikenyl residues and alkynyl residues, the substituents can be situated in any desired positions.<br>
Examples of cycioalkyi residues are cyclopropyl, cyciobutyl, cydopentyl, cyclohexyl or cycloheptyl.<br>
Halogen is fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine, preferably chlorine or fluorine.<br><br>
In substituted phenyl residues, the substituents can be situated in any desired positions. In monosubstituted phenyl residues, the substituent can be situated in the 2-position, the 3-position or the 4-position. In disubstituted phenyl residues, the substituents can be situated in the 2,3-position, 2,4-position, 2,5-position, 2,6-position, 3,4-position or 3,5-position. If a phenyl residue carries three substituents, these can be situated in the 2,3,4-position, 2,3,5-positJon, 2,3,6-position, 2,4,5-position, 2,4,6-position or 3,4,5-position. If a phenyl residue carries a further phenyl residue as a substituent, this second phenyl residue can also be unsubstituted or can be substituted by the substituents which are given for the first phenyl residue (apart from by a phenyl residue).<br>
Heteroaryl is understood as meaning residues of monocyclic or bicyciic aromatic ring systems, which in the case of the monocyclic systems have a 5-membered ring or a 6-membered ring and in the case of the bicyciic systems have two fused 5-membered rings,'a 6-membered ring fused to a 5-membered ring or two fused 6-membered rings. The heteroaryl residues can be conceived as being residues derived from cyclopentadienyl, phenyl, pentaienyl, indenyl or naphthyl by replacement of one or two CH groups and/or CH2 groups by S, 0, N, NH (or an N atom carrying a substituent such as, for example, N-CH3), where the aromatic ring system is retained or an aromatic ring system is formed. In addition to the one or two ring heteroatoms, they contain three to nine ring carbon atoms. Examples of heteroaryl are, in particular, furyl, thienyl, pyrrolyl, imidazoiyi, pyrazolyl, 1,3-oxazoiyl, 1,2-oxazolyl, 1,3-thiazolyl, 1,2-thiazolyl, pyridyi, pyrazinyl, pyrimidyl, pyridazinyl, indolyl, benzofuranyl, quinolyl, isoquinolyl or benzopyranyl. A heteroaryl residue can be bonded via any suitable carbon atom. For example, a thienyl residue can be present as a 2-thienyl residue or 3-thienyl residue, a furyl residue as a 2-furyl residue or 3-furyl residue, a pyridyi residue as a 2-pyridyl residue, 3-pyridyl residue or 4-pyridyi residue. A residue which is derived from 1,3-thiazole or from imidazole can be bonded via the 2-position, the 4-position or the 5-position. Suitable nitrogen heterocycies can also be present as N-oxides or as quaternary salts having an anion<br><br>
derived from a physiologically tolerable acid as a countehon. Pyridyi residues can be present, for example, as pyridine N-oxides.<br>
If two ring oxygen atoms are present in a saturated 4-membered to 7-membered<br>
heterocycle containing one or two oxygen atoms as ring heteroatoms, these are not<br>
bonded directly to one another, but at least one ring carbon atom is situated between<br>
them. Examples of saturated 4-membered to 7-membered heterocydes which<br>
contain one or two oxygen atoms as ring heteroatoms are oxetane, tetrahydrofuran,<br>
tetrahydropyran, oxepane, 1,3-dioxolane or 1,4-dioxane. Preferred heterocydes are<br>
those which contain one ring oxygen atom. Particulariy preferred heterocydes are<br>
tetrahydrofuran and tetrahydropyran. The saturated oxygen heterocydes can be<br>
bonded via any ring carbon atom, oxetane, for example, via the 2-position or the 3-<br>
position, tetrahydrofuran via the 2-position or the 3-position, tetrahydropyran via the<br>
2-position, the 3-position or the 4-position, 1,3-dioxoiane via the 2-position or the 4-<br>
position. Tetrahydrofuran and tetrahydropyran are preferably bonded via the 2-<br>
position,	,   ,<br>
The present invention includes all stereoisomeric forms of the compounds of the formula I. Asymmetric centers present in the compounds of the formula I can all independently of one another have the S configuration or the R configuration or the compounds can be present as an R/S mixture with respect to any of the asymmetric centers. The invention includes all possible enantiomers and diastereomers, as well as mixtures of two or more stereoisomeric forms, for example mixtures of enantiomers and/or diastereomers, in all ratios. Enantiomers, for example, are thus a subject of the invention in enantiomerically pure form, both as levorotatory and as dextrorotatory antipodes, in the form of racemates and in the form of mixtures of the two enantiomers in ail ratios. In the presence of cis/trans isomerism (or E/Z isomerism), both the cis form and the trans form and mixtures of these forms in all ratios are a subject of the invention. The preparation of individual stereoisomers can be carried out, if desired, by separation of a mixture according to customary methods, for example by chromatography or crystallization, or by use of stereochemically uniform starting substances in the synthesis or by stereoselective reactions. If<br><br>
appropriate, a denvatization or salt formation can be carried out before separation of stereoisomers. The separation of a stereoisomer mixture can be carried out at the stage of the compounds of the formula I or at the stage of an intermediate in the course of the synthesis. The invention also includes all tautomeric forms of the compounds of the formula 1.<br>
Physiologically tolerable salts of the compounds of the formula I are, in particular, nontoxic salts or pharmaceutically utilizable salts. They can contain inorganic or organic salt components. Such salts can be prepared, for example, from compounds of the formula I which contain one or more acidic groups, and nontoxic inorganic or organic bases. Possible bases are, for example, suitable alkali metal compounds or alkaline earth metal compounds, such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, or ammonia or organic amino compounds or quaternary ammonium hydroxides. Reactions of compounds of the formula I with bases for the preparation of the salts are in general carried out in a solvent or diluent according to customary procedures. On account of the physiological and chemical stability, advantageous salts are, in the presence of acidic groups, in many cases sodium, potassium, magnesium or calcium salts or ammonium salts which can carry one or more organic residues on the nitrogen. Salt formation on the nitrogen atom of the benzenesuifonamide group leads to compounds of the formula II<br><br>
R(4)   0<br><br>
R(2)<br><br>
II<br><br>
in which A(1), A(2), A(3), R(1), R(2), R(3), R(4), X, Y and Z have the meanings indicated above and the cation M, for example, is an alkali metal ion or an equivalent of an alkaline earth metal ion, for example the sodium, potassium, magnesium or calcium ion, or the unsubstituted ammonium ion or an ammonium ion having one or more organic residues. An ammonium ion which is M can also be, for example, the<br><br>
cation which is obtained from an amino acid by protonation, in particular a basic amino acid such as, for example, lysine or arginine.<br>
Compounds of the formula 1 which contain one or more basic, that is protonatable, groups can be present in the form of their acid addition salts with physiologically tolerable inorganic or organic acids and are used according to the invention, for example, as salts with hydrogen chloride, phosphoric add, sulfuric acid or organic carboxylic acids or sulfonic adds such as, for example, p-toluenesulfonic acid, acetic acid, tartaric acid, benzoic acid, fumaric acid, maleic add, citric acid etc. Acid addition salts can also be obtained from the compounds of the formula I by customary processes known to the person skilled in the art, for example by combination with an organic or inorganic acid in a solvent or diluent. If the compounds of the formula I simultaneously contain acidic and basic groups in the molecule, the present invention also includes, in addition to the salt forms described, inner salts or betaines (zwitterions). The present invention also includes all salts of the compounds of the formula I which, because of low physiological tolerability, are not directly suitable for use in pharmaceuticals, but are suitable, for example, as intermediates for chemical reactions or for the preparation of physiologically tolerable salts, for example by anion exchange or cation exchange.<br>
The present invention furthermore includes ail solvates of compounds of the formula I, for example hydrates or adducts with alcohols, and also derivatives of the compounds of the formula I such as, for example, esters and amides of acid groups, and prodrugs and active metabolites of compounds of the formula I.<br>

Also with respect to all preferred compounds of the formula I, the present invention includes all their stereoisomeric forms and mixtures thereof in all ratios, and their physiologically tolerable salts. Also from the preferred compounds which are a subject of the present invention per se, those compounds are excluded which are excluded above from the general definition of the compounds of the formula I by the disclaimer.<br>
Thus, for example, a group of preferred compounds is formed by those compounds of the formula I in which Z is NH, X is sulfur and R(2) is methyl, and the other residues have the general or preferred meanings indicated above, in all their stereoisomeric forms and mixtures thereof in all ratios, and their physiologically tolerable salts.<br>

in which R(2) has the meanings indicated above. Suitable bases are, for example, alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hydroxides, hydrides, amides or alkoxides, such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, sodium hydride, potassium hydride, calcium hydride, sodium amide, potassium amide, sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, potassium tert-butoxide, or quaternary ammonium hydroxides.

The salt of the formula V, however, can particularly advantageously also be produced in situ from the compound of the formula III and reacted directly with the isothiocyanate of the formula IV. Suitable inert solvents for the reaction are, for example, ethers such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), dioxane, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DME) or diglyme, ketones such as acetone or butanone, nltrHes such as acetbriitrile, nitro compounds such as nitromethane, esters such as ethyl acetate, amides such as dimethylformamide (DMF) or N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), hexamethylphosphortriamide (HMPT), sulfoxides such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene or xylenes. Mixtures of these solvents with one another are furthermore suitable. The reaction of the compounds of the formula 111 and/or V with the compound of the formula IV is usually earned out at temperatures from room temperature to 1 SO’'C.<br>

R(2)-N=C=0	VI<br>
in which R(2) has the meanings indicated above. The above explanations for the reaction with isothiocyanates correspondingly apply to the reaction with the isocyanates.<br>
Benzenesulfonylureas of the formula Id can also be prepared from the benzenesulfonamides of the formula III and/or their salts of the formula V by reaction with R(2)-substituted 2,2,2-trichloroacetamides of the formula VII<br>

The replacement of the sulfur atom in the thiourea group of the compounds of the formula Ic by an oxygen atom can be carried out, for example, with the aid of oxides or salts of heavy metals or by use of oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide, sodium peroxide or nitrous acid.<br>
Benzenesulfonylureas and -thioureas of the formulae id and Ic can also be prepared by reaction of amines of the formula R(2)-NH2 with benzenesulfonyl isocyanates and isothiocyanates of the formula VlII<br><br>

VIII<br><br>
in which A(1), A(2), A(3), R(1), R(3), R(4) and Y have the abovementioned meanings and X is oxygen or sulfur The sulfonyi isocyanates of the formula VIII (X = oxygen) can be obtained from the benzenesulfonamides of the formula III according to customary methods, for example using phosgene. The sulfonyl isothiocyanates of the formula VIII (X = sulfur) can be prepared by reaction of the sulfonamide of the formula III with alkali metal hydroxides and carbon disulfide in an organic solvent such as DMF, DMSO or NMP. The di-alkali metal salt of the sulfonyldithiocarbamic acid obtained in this case can be reacted in an inert solvent with a slight excess of phosgene or of a phosgene substitute such as triphosgene or with a chloroformic acid esteir,(2 equivalents) or wfth thionyl chloride. The solution of tKe sulfonyl iso(thio)cyanate of the formula VIII obtained can be reacted directly with the appropriate substituted amine of the formula R(2)-NH2 or, if compounds of the formula t are to be prepared in which R(2) is hydrogen, with ammonia.<br>
Correspondingly, starting from the benzenesulfonyl iso(thio)cyanates of the formula Vill, by means of addition of alcohols of the formula R(2)-0H compounds of the formula I can be prepared in which Z is oxygen, that is the benzenesulfonylurethane derivatives of the formula le<br><br>

in which A(1), A(2), A(3), R(1), R(2), R(3), R(4) and Y have the abovementioned meanings, but as mentioned R(2) is not hydrogen, and X is oxygen or sulfur. Compounds of the formula le can also be prepared, for example by reacting, analogously to the syntheses described above, benzenesulfonamides of the formula III and/or their salts of the formula V in an inert solvent, for example a high-boiling ether, with reactive carbonic acid derivatives, for example with chloroformic acid esters of the formula C1-C0-0R(2) or pyrocarbonic acid diesters of the formula (R(2)0-C(=0))20. Starting from the compounds of the formula le in which X is oxygen, compounds of the formula Id are obtainable by action of the appropriate amine of the formula R(2)-NH2 in an inert high-boiling solvent, for example toluene, at temperatures up to the boiling point of the respective solvent.<br>
Compounds of the formula I in which X is the cyanoimino group =N-CN are obtainable, for example, by reacting diphenyl N-cyanoiminocarbonates of the formula NC-N=C(0-C6H5)2 with a benzenesulfonamide of the formula III and/or its salt of the formula V in the presence of a base and then treating the N-cyano-0-phenylbenzenesulfonyiisourea obtained as an intermediate with an amine of the formula R(2)-NH2.<br>
The benzenesulfonamides of the formula III as starting compounds for the above-mentioned processes for the synthesis of the benzenesulfonyl(thio)ureas of the formula I can be prepared by or analogously to known methods such as are described in the literature, for example in the standard works such as Houben-Weyi, Methoden der Organischen Chemie [Methods of Organic Chemistry], Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart, and Organic Reactions, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York, and also in the patent documents indicated above, if appropriate with suitable adaptation of the reaction conditions which is familiar to the person skilled in the art. Use can also be made of synthetic variants which are known per se, but not mentioned here in greater detail. In the syntheses, it may also be appropriate to temporarily block functional groups which would react in an undesired manner or give rise to side reactions, by protective groups or to employ them in the form of precursor groups which are converted into the desired groups only later. Strategies of this type are<br><br>
known to the person skilled in the art. Starting substances, if desired; can also be formed in situ in such a way that they are not isolated from the reaction mixture but immediately reacted further.<br>
Thus, for example, p-substituted benzene derivatives of the formula IX<br>

IX<br><br>
in which Y has the abovementioned meanings and R(0), for example, is (Ci-C4)-alkyl, (Ci-C4)-alkoxy, bromine or nitro, can be reacted with trifiuoroacetic anhydride in the presence of pyridine in an inert solvent such as THF to give compounds of the formula X<br><br><br>
X<br><br>
in which Y and R(0) have the meanings indicated above.<br>
Starting from the compounds of the formula X in which R(0) is nitro, it is possible by means of a reduction of the nitro group using a reductant such as, for example, SnCl2 X 2 H2O in an inert solvent such as ethyl acetate, diazotization of the resulting amino group and subsequent reaction of the intermediate diazo compound by processes known per se, such as are described, for example, in Larock, Comprehensive Organic Transformations, VCH, 1989, for example by reaction with potassium iodide for the preparation of the iodo compounds, to obtain the corresponding p-haio-substituted compounds of the formula XI<br><br><br>
XI<br><br>
in which Y has the meanings indicated above and Hal is halogen.<br>
The compounds of the formula XI and the compounds of the formula X in which R(0) is (Ci-C4)-alkyl, (Ci-C4)-alkoxy or bromine, which are summarily designated as compounds of the formula XII<br><br><br>
R(1a)<br><br>
XII<br><br>
in which Y has the meanings indicated above and R(1a) is (Ci-C4)-alkyl, (CI-CA)-alkoxy or halogen, can be converted in a manner known per se into the benzenesulfonamides of the formula XIII<br><br><br>
XIII<br><br>
in which Y and R(1a) have the meanings mentioned. The sulfonamides of the formula Xlll can be prepared from the compounds of the formula XII in one, two or more steps, in particular, processes are preferred in which the acylamines of the formula XII are first converted into the 2,5-substituted benzenesulfonic acids or their derivatives such as, for example, the sulfonyl halides, by electrophilic reagents in the presence or absence of inert solvents at temperatures of -20°C to 120’C, preferably<br><br>
of O’C to 100'C. For this, it is possible to carry out, for example, suifonations with sulfuric acids or oleum, halosulfonations with halosulfonic acids such as chlorosulfonic acid, reactions with suifuryl halides in the presence of anhydrous metal halides, or reactions with thionyt halides in the presence of anhydrous metal halides with subsequent oxidations carried out in a known manner to give suifonyl chlorides. If sulfonic acids are the primary reaction products, these can either be converted into suifonyl acid halides directly in a manner known per se by means of acid halides such as, for example, phosphorus trihalides, phosphorus pentahalides, thionyl halides or oxalyl halides, or after treatment with amines such as, for example, triethylamine or pyridine, or alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hydroxides or reagents which form these basic compounds in situ. The sulfonic acid derivatives are converted into the sulfonamides of the formula XIII in a manner known from the literature. Preferably, sulfonyi acid chlorides are reacted with aqueous ammonia in an inert solvent such as, for example, acetone at temperatures of 0°C to lOO’'C.<br>
F’orthe preparation of compounds of the formula I in which R(1) is (Ci-C4)-alkyl, (Ci-C4)-alkoxy or halogen, the compounds of the formula XII! can be converted by treatment with an acid such as, for example, hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid, if appropriate with addition of a polar organic solvent such as methanol or ethanoi, at temperatures of 0*’0 up to the boiling point of the solvent, into the compounds of the fomiula XIV<br><br><br>
XIV<br><br>
in which R(1a) is (Ci-C4)-alkyl, {Ci-C4)-alkoxy or halogen and Y has the meaning indicated above. For the preparation of compounds of the formula I in which R(1) denotes the other abovementioned residues, the sulfonamide group in suitable compounds of the formula Xlil can first be temporarily protected by conversion into the N-(N,N-dimethylaminomethylene)suifonamide group. For example, starting from<br><br>
compounds of the formula XIII, the dimethylaminomethylene compounds of the formula XV<br><br>
R(1b)<br><br>
XV<br><br>
in which Y has the meanings mentioned and R(1b) is (Ci-C4)-alkoxy, bromine or iodine, can be prepared by reacting the compounds of the formula XIII, for example, with N,N-dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal or reacting with N,N-dimethylformamide in the presence of dehydrating agents such as thionyl chloride, phosphorus oxychloride or phosphorus pentachloride.<br>
The compounds of the formula XV in which R(1b) is (Ci-C4)-alkoxy can then be converted by ether cleavage into the phenols of the formula XVI<br><br><br>
XVI<br><br>
in which Y is as defined above. This ether cleavage is carried out, for example, by treatment of the methoxy compounds of the formula XV with acids or with Lewis acids such as boron trifluoride, boron trichloride, boron tribromide or aluminum trichloride or their etherates, preferably with boron tribromide in an inert solvent such as, for example, methylene chloride.<br>
The phenols of the formula XVI obtained can be converted into the compounds of the formula XVII<br><br><br>
XVII<br><br>
in which Y has the abovementioned meanings and R(1c) is one of the residues -0-(Ci-C4)-aIkyl-E(1)-(Ci-C4)-aikyl-D(1), -0-{Ci-C4)-aikyl which is substituted by an oxygen heterocycle, -0-{C2-C4)-alkenyl, -0-{Ci-C4)-alkyi-phenyl or-O-phenyl. This conversion is carried out by means of an 0-alkylation of the phenols of the formula XVI using appropriately substituted halogen compounds, for example iodides or bromides, or appropriately substituted sulfonic acid esters such as mesylates, tosyiates or trifiuoromethylsulfonates. Thus, for example, with 2-bromoethyl methyl ether or benzyl bromide, the compounds of the formula 1 are obtained in which R(1) is 2-methoxyethoxy- or benzyloxy. The 0-alkylation is in general carried out in the presence of abase in an inert solvent at temperatures of 0’*0 up to the boiling point   ■ of the solvent by processes known per se. The preparation of compounds of the formula XVII in which R(1c) is -0-phenyl is carried out by means of an 0-arylation of the phenols of the formula XVI using phenylboronic acids, for example phenylboronic acid or substituted phenylboronic acids such as 4-methoxyphenylboronic acid, in the presence of copper catalysts, for example copper(ll) acetate, for example analogously to the reactions described in Tetrahedron Lett. 39 (1998), 2937.<br>
Starting from the compounds of the formula XV in which R(1 b) is bromine or iodine, the compounds of the formula XVIII<br><br>
R(1d)<br><br>
xvm<br><br>
can be obtained in which Y has the meanings indicated and R(1d) is one of the residues (Ci-C4)-alkyl, phenyl, (CrCsj-alkenyl, (C2-C5)-alkynyl, heteroaryl.<br><br>
-S(0)m-phenyl or -S(0)m-(Ci-C4)-alkyl. This conversion into the compounds of the formula XVIII is carried out by means of palladium-catalyzed Suzuki coupling with arylboronic acids, for example phenylboronic add, 4-methoxyphenylboronic acid or 4-methylthiophenylboronic acid, or heteroarylboronic acids, for example thienylboronic acid, or by Stille coupling with trialkylstannanes, for example tributyistannylfuran, thmethylstannylpyridine or ethynyltributylstannane. The Suzuki coupling is carried out in the presence of pailadium(II) acetate and triphenylphosphine or tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium and a base such as, for example, cesium carbonate or potassium carbonate; corresponding reactions are described in the literature. The Stille coupling is carried out analogously to literature procedures using bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(lI) chloride as a catalyst. The preparation of suitable stannanes is described, for example, in Tetrahedron 49 (1993), 3325. The preparation of compounds of the formula XVlIi in which R(1d) is alkyl is carried out by Pd(0)-catalyzed Nikishi-Kumada coupling of the compounds of the formula XV in which R(1b) is iodine with an appropriate organozinc derivative in the presence of 1,1*-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene, palladium(II) acetate and copper(l) iodide as catalysts in an inert solvent; corresponding couplings are described, for example, in Synlett1996, 473.<br>
Compounds of the formula XVIII in which R(1d) is -S-phenyi or -S-(Ci-C4)-alkyl can be prepared analogously to literature procedures by means of a copper(I) iodide-catalyzed nucleophilic substitution reaction from the compounds of the formula XV in which R(1b) is iodine, using the sodium salt of the corresponding mercaptan. The thioether group thus introduced, and also a thioether group in another position of the molecule of the formula 1, can be oxidized to the sulfoxide group or to the sulfone group by standard processes, for example using a peracid such as m-chloroperbenzoic acid.<br>
The subsequent removal of the dimethyiaminomethylene group and/or the trifluoroacetyl group functioning as a sulfonamide protective group or amino protective group, respectively, from the compounds of the formulae XVII and XVlll then leads to the corresponding compounds having an H2N-Y group and H2N-SO2<br><br>
group, which are represented together with the compounds of the formula XIV by the formula XIX<br><br><br>
XIX<br><br>
in which Y and R(1) have the meanings indicated above for the formula 1. This removal of the protective groups can be carried out either under basic or under acidic conditions. Preferably, it is carried out by treatment of the compounds of the formulae XVII and XVII! in a suitable solvent, for example an alcohol, with acids such as, for example, hydrochloric acid.<br>
The benzenesulfonamides of the formula XIX are then reacted with cinnamic acid derivatives to give cinnamoylaminoalkyl-substituted benzenesulfonamides of the formula III. In general, this acylation is carried out by first converting the appropriate cinnamic acid into a reactive derivative, for example by reaction of the cinnamic acid with carbonylbisimidazole in an inert solvent such as, for example, THF, dioxane or DMF, and subsequent reaction with the amine of the formula XIX, if appropriate in the presence of a base such as triethylamine or pyridine. Reactive cinnamic acid derivatives which can be used, for example, are also cinnamic add halides or cinnamic anhydrides. The reactions are in this case preferably carried out at temperatures from 0*’0 up to the boiling point of the solvent chosen, particulariy preferably at room temperature. The acylation of the amines of the formula XIX with the cinnamic acids can also be carried out, for example, in the presence of condensing agents such as, for example, N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, 0-((cyano-(ethoxycarbonyl)methylene)amino)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TOTU) or 1-benzotriazolyloxytripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBOP).<br>
The steps for the preparation of the compounds of the formula I described can also be carried out in other sequences. Depending on the substituents to be introduced in<br><br>
the individual steps, one or the other variants can be more advantageous. Thus, for example, the preparation of the compounds of the formula III in which R(1) is one of the residues (Ci-C4)-alkyl, phenyl, (C2-C5)-alkenyl, (C2-C5)-alkynyl, heteroaryl, -S(0)m-phenyl or -S(0)m-{Ci-C4)-a[kyl, can also be carried out in such a way that a compound of the formula XIV in which R(1a) is iodine or bromine is first converted, by means of the coupling with a cinnamic acid derivative described above and temporary protection of the sulfonamide group, into a compound of the formula XX<br><br>
R(4)   0<br><br>

XX<br><br>
in which A(1), A(2), A(3), R(3), R(4) and Y are defined as for the formula 1 and Hal’ is iodine or bromine. Starting from the compound of the formula XX, it is then possible by means of the Suzuki, Stille or Nikishi-Kumada couplings described above with the appropriate coupling components mentioned above to obtain the compounds of the formula XXI<br><br>
A(1)<br>
R(4)   0<br><br>
//W<br>
0    0<br><br>
XXI<br><br>
in which A(1), A(2), A(3), R(1d), R(3), R(4) and Y have the meanings indicated above. The compounds of the formula XX! can then be converted into the compounds of the formula III by removal of the sulfonamide protective group « according to the process described above.<br><br>
The compounds of the formula I inhibit ATP-sensitive potassium channels and affect the action potential of cells, in particular of cardiac muscle cells. In particular, they have a normalizing action on a disturbed action potential, as is present, for example, in ischemias, and are suitable, for example, for the treatment and prophylaxis of disorders of the cardiovascular system, in particular of arrhythmias and their sequelae, for example of ventricular fibrillation. The activity of the compounds of the formula 1 can be demonstrated, for example, in the model described below in which the action potential duration is determined on the papillary muscle of the guinea pig.<br>
In addition to their action on ATP-sensitive potassium channels in the heart muscle cell, the compounds of the formula 1 also have an action on the peripheral and/or the central autonomic nervous system. In particular, they affect ATP-sensitive potassium channels of the vagal nervous system and have a stimulating action on the vagal nervous system, in particular a stimulating action on the vagal nervous system of the heart by inhibition of ATP-sensitive potassium channels in the cardiac nerve.<br>
In the ideal case, an optimum cooperation, adapted to the particular situation, exists between the vagal (or parasympathetic) nervous system (= depressing nervous system) and the sympathetic nervous system (= stimulating nervous system). In the<br>
'   case of disease, however, this cooperation can be disturbed and a dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system can be present, that is an imbalance can exist between the activity of the vagal nervous system and the activity of the sympathetic nervous system, Sympathovagal imbalance is understood in general as meaning an overactivity or hyperfunction of the sympathetic (= stimulating) nervous system<br>
)   and/or an impaired function or hypofunction of the vagal (= depressing) nervous system, where the two parts of the nervous system can mutually influence each other in particular, it is known that a hypofunction of the vagal system can result in a hyperfunction of the sympathetic system. For the avoidance of damage to ceils or organs of the body by overshooting biological or biochemical processes which are<br>
D   stimulated by too high an activity of the sympathetic nervous system, it is therefore attempted in such cases to balance out a sympathovagal imbalance, for example to restore the normal vagal activity by the treating a vagal dysfunction or hypofunction.<br><br>
Examples of diseases in which elimination of a harmful sympathovagal imbalance by treatment of a vagal dysfunction is possible are organic heart diseases, for example coronary heart disease, cardiac insufficiency and cardiomyopathies. Damages to health which result from an imbalance of the autonomic nervous system when the dysfunction relates to the heart are, for example, weakening of the myocardial contractile force and fatal cardiac arrhythmias. The significance of the autonomic nervous system for sudden cardiac death in heart disease was described, for example, by PJ. Schwartz (The ATRAMI prospective study: implications for risk stratification after myocardial infarction; Cardiac Electrophysiology Review 1998, 2, 38 - 40) or T. Kinugawa et al. (Altered vagal and sympathetic control of heart rate in left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure; Am. J. Physiol. 1995, 37, R310 - 316). Experimental investigations with electrical stimulation of the cardiac vagus nerve or stimulating analogs of the vagal transmitter acetylcholine, for example carbachol, confirm the protective action of a vagal activation against fatal cardiac arrhythmias (see, for example, E. Vanoli et al., Vagal stimulation and prevention of sudden death in conscious dogs with a healed myocardial infarction; Circ. Res. 1991, 68(5), 1471 -81).<br>
A sympathovagal imbalance, however, can also occur, for example, as a result of a metabolic disorder, for example diabetes mellitus (see, for example, A. J. Burger et al., Short- and long-term reproducibility of heart rate variability in patients with long¬standing type 1 diabetes mellitus; Am. J. Cardiol. 1997, 80, 1198 - 1202). A hypofunction of the vagal system can also temporarily occur, for example in the case of oxygen deficiency, for example oxygen deficiency of the heart, which leads to an undersecretion of vagal neurotransmitters, for example of acetylcholine.<br>
On account of the surprising ability of the compounds of the formula I to abolish a hypofunction of the vagal system or to restore the normal vagal activity, these compounds offer an efficient possibility of decreasing, eliminating or preventing dysfunctions of the autonomic nervous system, in particular in the heart, and its consequences such as, for example, the disease conditions mentioned. The efficacy<br><br>
of the compounds of the fomiula I in the abolition of dysfunctions of the autonomic nervous system, in particular of a vagal dysfunction of the heart, can be demonstrated, for example, in the model of chloroform-induced ventricular fibrillation in the mouse described below.<br>
The above and the following statements regarding the biological action on ATP-sensitive potassium channels in the heart and on the autonomic nervous system and the uses of the compounds of the formula I do not only apply to the compounds defined above which are per se a subject of the present invention, but also to the compounds of the formula 1 in which, simultaneously, X is oxygen, Z is NH, R(1) is halogen, (Ci-C4)-alkyi or -0-(Ci-C4)-alkyl and R(2) is (C2-C6)-alkyl or (C5-C7)-cycloalkyl, and their physiologically tolerable salts and prodrugs, that is also to the compounds which are excluded by the disclaimer in the above definition of the compounds but which likewise surprisingly have an action on the autonomic nervous system, in particular on the heart, and can abolish vagal dysfunctions. If not stated otherwise, in the above and the following statements regarding the biological action and the use, compounds of the formula I are expressly to be understood as including also the compounds excluded above by the disclaimer. The above explanations with respect to the compounds per se, for example with respect to preferred meanings of residues, correspondingly apply to all the compounds of the formula I as understood here. As particularly preferred groups of compounds with respect to the biological action and the uses, moreover those compounds of the formula I, including the compounds in which, at the same time, X is oxygen, Z is NH, R(1) is halogen, (Ci-C4)-alkyl or -0-{Ci-C4)-alkyl and R(2) is (C2-C6)-alkyl or (C5-C7)-cycloalkyl and their physiologically tolerable salts, may be mentioned here in which R(2) is (Ci-C3)-alkyl, in particular methyl, and/or X is sulfur.<br>
The compounds of the formula I and their physiologically tolerable salts can be used as pharmaceuticals on their own, in mixtures with one another or in the form of pharmaceutical preparations in animals, preferably in mammals, and in particular in humans. Mammals in which the compounds of the formula I can be used or tested are, for example, monkeys, dogs, mice, rats, rabbits, guinea pigs, cats and larger<br><br>
farm animals such as, for example, cattle and pigs. The invention therefore also relates to the compounds of the formula I - without the compounds in which, simultaneously, X is oxygen, Z is NH, R(1) is halogen, (Ci-C4)-alkyl or -0-(Ci-C4)-alkyl and R(2) is (C2-C6)-alkyl or (C5-C7)-cycloalkyl - and their physiologically tolerable salts and their prodrugs for use as pharmaceuticals. The invention also relates to pharmaceutical preparations (or pharmaceutical compositions) which contain an efficacious dose of at least one compound of the formula I - without the compounds in which, at the same time, X is oxygen, Z is NH, R(1) is halogen, (Ci-C4)-alkyl or -0-{Ci-C4)-alkyl and R(2) is (C2-C6)-alkyl or (C5-C7)-cycioalkyl - and/or a physiologically tolerable salt and/or a prodrug thereof as an active constituent and a pharmaceutically tolerable carrier, that is one or more pharmaceutically innocuous vehicles and/or additives.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations can be intended for enteral or parenteral use and normally contain about 0.5 to about 90 percent by weight of the compound of the formula I and/or its physioiogically tolerable salts. The amount of active compound of the formula 1 and/or its physiologically tolerable salts in the phannaceutical preparations is in general about 0.2 to about 1000 mg, preferably about 1 to about 500 mg. The pharmaceutical preparations can be produced in a manner known per se. For this, the compounds of the formula I and/or their physiologically tolerable salts are mixed together with one or more solid or liquid vehicles and/or excipients and, if desired, in combination with other pharmaceuticals, for example cardiovascular-active pharmaceuticals such as, for example, calcium antagonists, ACE inhibitors or P-blockers, and brought into a suitable dose form and administration form, which can then be used as a pharmaceutical in human medicine or veterinary medicine.<br>
Suitable vehicles are organic and inorganic substances which are suitable, for example, for enteral (for example oral or rectal) administration or for parenteral administration (for example intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous injection or infusion) or for topical or percutaneous application and do not react with the compounds of the formula I in an undesired manner. Examples which may be mentioned are water, vegetable oils, waxes, alcohols such as ethanol, propanediol or<br><br>
benzyl alcohols, glycerol, polyots, polyethylene glycols, polypropylene glycols, glycerol triacetate, gelatin, carbohydrates such as lactose or starch, stearic acid and its salts such as magnesium stearate, talc, lanolin, petroleum jelly or mixtures of vehicles, for example mixtures of water with one or more organic solvents, such as mixtures of water with alcohols. For oral and rectal administration, in particular pharmaceutical forms such as tablets, fiim-coated tablets, sugar-coated tablets, granules, hard and soft gelatin capsules, suppositories, solutions, preferably oily, alcoholic or aqueous solutions, syrups, juices or drops, furthermore suspensions or emulsions, are used. For topical administration, in particular ointments, creams, pastes, lotions, gels, sprays, foams, aerosols, solutions or powders are used. Solvents for solutions which can be used are, for example, water or alcohols such as ethanol, isopropanol or 1,2-propanediol or their mixtures with one another or with water. Further possible pharmaceutical forms are, for example, also implants. The compounds of the formula 1 and their physiologically tolerable salts can also be lyophilized and the lyophiiizates obtained used, for example, for the production of injection preparations. Liposorhal preparations are also possible, in particular for topical application. Examples of excipients (or additives) which can be present in the pharmaceutical preparations and which may be mentioned are lubricants, preservatives, thickeners, stabilizing agents, disintegrants, wetting agents, agents for achieving a depot effect, emulsifiers, salts (for example for affecting the osmotic pressure), buffer substances, colorants, flavorings and aromatizers. The pharmaceutical preparations, if desired, can also contain one or more further active compounds and/or, for example, one or more vitamins.<br>
On account of their ability to inhibit ATP-sensitive potassium channels, in particular in the heart, and/or to decrease or to eliminate an inadequate function of the vagal nervous system and thereby a vagal dysfunction or a dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system, in particular in the heart, the compounds of the formula I and their physiologically tolerable salts and prodrugs are valuable agents for therapy and prophylaxis which are suitable not only as antiarrhythmics and for the control and prevention of the sequelae of arrhythmias, but also for treatment and prophylaxis in other heart diseases or disorders of the cardiovascular system. Examples of<br><br>
diseases of this type which may be mentioned are cardiac insufficiency, cardiomyopathies, cardiac hypertrophy, coronary heart disease, angina pectoris, ischemias, vagal dysfunction of the heart or, for example, vagal dysfunction of the heart in diabetes mellitus. The compounds of the formula I can be generally employed in the therapy or prophylaxis of diseases which are associated with a dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system or a hypofunction or dysfunction of the vagal nervous system, in particular in the heart, or are caused by a dysfunction of this type or for whose therapy or prophylaxis an increase or normalization of the activity of the vagal nervous system is desired. The compounds of the formula 1 can also be employed in dysfunctions of the autonomic nervous system, in particular a vagal dysfunction in the heart, which occur as a result of a metabolic disorder such as, for example, diabetes mellitus.<br>
Above all, the compounds of the formula I are used as antian"hythmics for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias of very different origins and especially for the prevention 6f sudden cardiac death due to ‘rrhythiriia. Examples'of arrhythmic-  ••'■■ ■ ,/-disorders of the heart are supraventricular arrhythmias such as, for example, atrial tachycardia, atrial flutter or paroxysmal supraventricular arrhythmias, or ventricular arrhythmias such as ventricular extrasystoles, but in particular life-threatening ventricular tachycardia or the particularly dangerous ventricular fibrillation. They are particulariy suitable for those cases where arrhythmias are a result of a constriction of a coronary vessel such as occur, for example, in angina pectoris or during acute cardiac infarct or as a chronic result of a cardiac infarct. They are therefore particulariy suitable in postinfarct patients for the prevention of sudden cardiac death. Further syndromes in which arrhythmias of this type and/or sudden cardiac death due to arrhythmia play a role are, for example, cardiac insufficiency or cardiac hypertrophy as a result of chronically raised blood pressure.<br>
Moreover, the compounds of the formula 1 are able to positively affect decreased contractility of the heart and a weakened myocardial contractile force. This can be a disease-related decline in cardiac contractility, such as, for example, in cardiac insufficiency, but also acute cases such as heart failure as an effect of shock.<br><br>
Generally, the compounds of the formula I and their physiologically tolerable salts are suitable for improving cardiac function. Especially in a heart transplantation, under the influence of the compounds of the formula I the heart can also resume its capability faster and more reliably after the operation has taken place. The same applies to operations on the heart which necessitate temporarily stopping cardiac activity by means of cardioplegic solutions.<br>
By virtue of the fact that the compounds of the formula I, in addition to their direct cardiac action, that is the effect on the action potential of the cardiac muscle cells, also have an indirect action on the nervous system of the heart or the parts of the nervous system acting on the heart, they can decrease or prevent the undesired sequelae on the heart starting from the nervous system or mediated by the nervous system in the respective disease state present. Further damage to health such as a weakening of the myocardial contractile force or in some cases fatal cardiac arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation can thereby be reduced or avoided. Through the elimination or reduction of the dysfunction of the autonomic hervous system, the compounds of the formula I have the effect that the weakened myocardial contractile force is normalized again and the cardiac arrhythmias which can lead to sudden cardiac death can no longer result. By selection of compounds of the formula I having a suitable profile of action with respect to direct cardiac action (= direct effect on the action potential of the cardiac muscle cells and on account of this direct effect on the contractile force and direct antiarrhythmic action) on the one hand and the action on the cardiac nerves on the other hand, it is possible in a particularly efficient manner with the aid of the compounds of the formula I to favorably influence heart diseases. Depending on the syndrome present, it can also be advantageous in this case to employ compounds of the formula I which only have a relatively low direct cardiac effect and owing to this, for example, only have a relatively low direct effect on the contractile force of the heart or the formation of arrhythmias, but can improve or normalize the myocardial contractile force or the heart rhythm via the effect of the autonomic nervous system.<br><br>
The present invention therefore also relates to the use of the compounds of the formula I - including the compounds in which, at the same time, X is oxygen, Z is NH, R(1) is halogen, (Ci-C4)-alkyi or -0-(Ci-C4)-alkyl and R(2) is (C2-C6)-alkyl or (C5-C7)" cycloalkyl - and/or their physiologically tolerable salts and/or their prodrugs, for the therapy or prophylaxis of the syndromes mentioned, and the use for the production of pharmaceuticals for the therapy or prophylaxis of the syndromes mentioned. Of the compounds of the formula I in which, simultaneously, X is oxygen, Z is NH, R(1) is halogen, (Ci-C4)-alkyl or -0-{Ci-C4)-aikyl and R(2) is (C2-C6)-alkyi or (C5-C7)-cycioalkyl, preferred compounds for the therapy or prophylaxis of the syndromes mentioned and for the production of pharmaceuticals for the therapy or prophylaxis of the syndromes mentioned are those compounds which only have a slight effect on the blood sugar level.<br>
The dosage of the compounds of the formula I or their physiologically tolerable salts depends, as is customary, on the circumstances of the respective individual case and "is adjusted by the person skilled in the art according to the customary rules and procedures. It depends, for example, on the compound of the formula I administered, its potency and duration of action, on the nature and severity of the individual syndrome, on the sex, age, weight and the individual responsiveness of the human or animal to be treated, on whether treatment is acute or prophylactic or whether, in addition to compounds of the formula I, further active compounds are administered. Normally, in the case of administration to an adult weighing about 75 kg, a dose is needed which is about 0.1 mg to about 100 mg per kg per day, preferably about 1 mg to about 10 mg per kg per day (in each case in mg per kg of body weight). The daily dose can be administered in the form of an oral or parenteral individual dose or can be divided into several, for example two, three or four, individual doses. The administration can also be carried out continuously. In particular, if acute cases of cardiac arrhythmias are treated, for example in an intensive care unit, parenteral administration, for example by injection or by intravenous continuous infusion, can be advantageous. A preferred dose range in critical situations is then about 1 to about 100 mg per kg of body weight per day. If appropriate, depending on individual<br><br>
behavior, it may be necessary to deviate upwards or downwards from the doses indicated.<br>
Apart from as a pharmaceutical active compound in human medicine and veterinary medicine, the compounds of the formula I can also be employed, for example, as auxiliaries for biochemical investigations or as a scientific tool if a respective effect on ion channels is intended, or for the isolation or characterization of potassium channels. They can furthermore be used for diagnostic purposes, for example in in-vitro diagnoses of cell samples or tissue samples. The compounds of the formula I and their salts can further be used as chemical intermediates, for example for the preparation of further pharmaceutical active compounds.<br>

Pharmacological investigations<br>
Action potential duration in the papillary muscle of the guinea pig<br>
ATP deficiency states, such as are observed during ischemia in the cardiac muscle cell, lead to a shortening of the action potential duration. They are’egarded as one of the causes of so-called reentry arrhythmias, which can cause sudden cardiac death. The opening of ATP-sensitive potassium channels by the lowering of the ATP level is regarded as causing this (ATP = adenosine triphosphate). For the measurement of the action potential in the papillary muscle of the guinea pig a standard microelectrode technique was employed .<br>
Guinea pigs of both sexes were killed by a blow to the head, the hearts were removed, the papillary muscles were separated out and suspended in an organ bath. The organ bath was irrigated with Ringer's solution (136 mmoi/l of NaCl, 3.3 mmol/l of KCI, 2.5 mmol/l of CaCb, 1.2 mmoi/l of KH2PO4, 1.1 mmol/l of MgS04, 5.0 mmol/I of glucose, 10.0 mmol/l of N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N*-(2-ethanesulfonic acid) (HEPES), pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH) and aerated with 100% oxygen at a temperature of 37*'C. The muscle was stimulated by means of an electrode using square-wave impulses of 1 V and 1 ms duration and a frequency of 1 Hz. The action potential was derived and recorded by means of a glass microelectrode inserted intracellulariy, which was filled with 3 mol/l of KCI solution. The substance to be tested was added to the Ringer's solution in a concentration of 2 pmol/I. The action<br><br>
potential was amplified using an amplifier from Hugo Sachs (March-Hugstetten, Germany) and stored and analyzed by means of a computer. The duration of the action potential was determined at a degree of repolarization of 90% (APD90). The action potential shortening was produced by addition of a solution of the potassium channel opener Rilmakalim (HOE 234) (W. Linz et al., Arzneimittelforschung/Drug Research, 42 (II) (1992) 1180-1185) (rilmakalim concentration 1 pg/ml). 30 minutes after the administration of rilmakalim, the action potential duration was recorded. The test substance was then added and the action potential duration, which was prolonged again, was recorded after a further 60 minutes. The test substances were added to the bath solution as stock solutions in propanediol.<br>
The following APD90 values (in milliseconds) were recorded.<br>

Chloroform-induced ventricular fibrillation in the mouse (action in the case of vagal dysfunction)<br>
A hypofunction of the vagal nervous system leads to a hyperfunction of the sympathetic nervous system. Damages to health which result from an imbalance of the autonomic nervous system if the dysfunction relates to the heart, include weakening of the myocardial contractile force and fatal cardiac arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation. The action of the test substances was investigated in the model of chloroform-induced ventricular fibrillation in the mouse (see J. W. Lawson,<br><br>
Antiarrhythmic activity of some isoquinoline derivatives determined by a rapid screening procedure in the mouse; J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. (1968) 160, 22).<br>
The test substance was dissolved in a mixture of dimethylsuifoxide (DMSO) and 10 percent sodium hydrogencarbonate solution and administered intraperitoneally (i.p,). The dose was 3 mg/kg. 30 minutes later, the mouse was anesthetized with chloroform in a beaker. As soon as respiratory arrest had occurred under deep anesthesia (toxic anesthesia stage), the thorax of the animal was opened with a pair of scissors and the heartbeat was visually inspected. It can be detected at a glance here whether the heart is beating, fibrillating or has stopped. The respiratory arrest induced by chloroform leads, via absolute anoxia (oxygen deficiency) in combination with a direct stimulating action of chloroform on the sympathetic nervous system, to a strong stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system which in turn leads, in combination with the energy deficiency produced in the heart by oxygen deficiency, to the fatal arrhythmia, ventricular fibrillation. This toxic chloroform anesthesia led to ventricular fibrillation in 100% of the untreated mice (control). The percentage proportion of the mice having ventricular fibrillation in the individual test groups (with n animals) is indicated as the fibrillation ratio.<br>
The following fibrillation ratios were determined.<br>
Test substance	Fibrillation ratio (in %)<br>
Untreated control (n = 300)	100 %<br>
Example 1  (n = 10)	60 %<br>
Examples (n = 10)	70%<br>
Examples (n = 10)	60 %<br>
Examples (n = 10)	63 %<br>
Example 12 (n = 10)	63%<br>
The reduction in the percentage proportion of mice with ventricular fibrillation in comparison with the control (with a 100% fibrillation ratio) confirms that the<br><br>
compounds of the formula I significantly prevent the occurrence of ventricular fibrillation.<br>
The observed effect of atropine, the classical blocker of muscarinergic (vagal) receptors of the autonomic nervous system which blocks the action of the vagal transmitter acetylchoiine at the level of the receptor, allows a conclusion to be made about the mechanism of action. The experiment is carried out here as described above. The compound of Example 8 was administered to the animals of the first experimental group (n = number of animals = 20) in an amount of 10 mg/kg i.p. 30 min after the administration, the animals were anesthetized with chloroform and the fibrillation ratio was determined. Atropine was administered to the animals of the second experimental group (n = 10) in an amount of 1 mg/kg i.v. 15 min after the administration, the animals were anesthetized with chloroform and the fibrillation ratio was determined. First the compound of Example 8 in an amount of 10 mg/kg i.p. and then, after 15 min, atropine in an amount of 1 mg/kg i.v. were administered to the animals of the third group (n = 10). After a further 15 min, the animals were anesthetized with chloroform and the fibrillation ratio was determined.<br>

The results show that atropine decreases or prevents the protective action of the compounds of the formula I. This abolition of the protective action of the compounds of the formula 1 by atropine cleariy points to a vagal mechanism of action.<br>
The lacking or only very low hypoglycemic action of the compounds of the formula I can be determined, for example, by determination of the membrane potential on isolated (3 cells of the pancreas, for example according to the method described in US-A-5698596 or EP-A-612 724 whose relevant contents are part of the present disclosure and which are incorporated herein by reference, or it can be shown in suitable mammalian cells, for example CHO cells which are transfected with human SUR1/Kir6.2 proteins as mofecular constituents of pancreatic ATP-sensitive potassium channels.<br><br><br><br><br>
