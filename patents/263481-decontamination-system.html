				<td>DECONTAMINATION   SYSTEM FIELD   OF THE  INVENTION<br>
     The present invention relates  to a  decontamination  system, notably to a system for  ensuring that a medical  device  is â€¢made  safe after use on  one patient prior to use  on another patient.     The-invention preferably makes use  of  chlorine dioxide   (C102)  as a sterilant.<br><br>
BACKGROUND TO THE  INVENTION<br>
"Traditionally,   the word   ^decontamination'  has been applied to those cleaning procedures - automatic and/or manual - that<br>
     take place prior to -sterilisation.     Recent documentation,<br>
"however y~ha-s ~reete-fi-Q-e:d -the -word -to apply to._the... whole  series of procedures to ensure that  a -device is made safe  after use on one patient prior to  us-e  on  a  second.     Decontamination  can thus  include cleaning-,., .disinfecting and- sterilising."    This<br>
     statement is ta&amp;en from an article published in the  ISSM<br>
(Institute of Sterile Service Managers)   Journal,   Vol.   5,   No. 1  July-Septembej 2000.     The  statement helps to  explain what the decontamination, process has come to mean in modern UK hospitals and goes on to refer to HTM203Q,  which has been the<br>
     driver for change in processing many types of medical<br>
instruments.    The term   ^decontamination'  will be used herein to refer to the above  redefinition,   including  cleaning  and sterilising.<br>
      Health Technical Memorandum   (HTM)   2030 was  introduced  in  1993 and updated in 1997 and 2001 to  improve the sterile processing performance  of washer disinfectors.   HTM2030 addresses the use of washer-disinfectors for instruments,<br><br>
many of which cannot be autoclaved, for example flexible endoscopes.  In essence, it describes the need to wash instruments thoroughly before disinfection/sterilisation (by heat or by chemical); to be followed by the<br>
  disinfection/sterilisation stage and to culminate, in the case of chemical disinfection, in the rinsing of the instrument.  KTM2030 also addresses the need for the entire process to be recorded in a traceability and audit system.<br>
  Two-part sterilising solutions are used in applications where the active sterilising ingredient is unstable over time.  The solution is therefore prepared in situ shortly before it is to be used. A particularly important sterilising agent is chlorine dioxide, which may be formed from mixtures of<br>
  various reagents including: chlorite and acid; chlorate,<br>
peroxide and acid; and chlorite, hypochlorite, and a suitable buffer.  Chlorine dioxide has excellent sterilising and bactericidal properties, and oral ingestion in man and animals has been shown to be relatively safe.<br><br>
The cleaning of endoscopes and other medical equipment with suitable chlorine dioxide solutions is known.  See, for example, European Patent Number 0 785 719 and United States Patent Numbers 5,696,046 and 6,007,772, the contents of which<br>
  are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
It is not always: convenient to mix up batches of solutions for use in sterilising equipment.  For wiping down (rather than thoroughly cleaning inside and out) of endoscopes and 30  probes, wipes of alcohol, general-purpose detergent, or soapy water are generally used, but these are not as effective as chlorine dioxide.  It is desirable to be able readily to make up small quantities of two-component sterilising agents when<br><br>
desired and to be able to make such agents up in a form in which they may be readily handled for a particular application.  It is particularly desired to provide a decontamination system which meets the HTM2030 standard.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a decontamination system suitable for 10  decontaminating items of medical equipment such as endoscopes, the system comprising:<br>
(I)	a plurality of pre-clean wipes comprising moist-<br>
fabric members for wiping an item to be decontaminated;<br>
(II)	a two-part sterilant system comprising:    . .Ji_^^i--<br>
      (a)  a first part comprising a first reagent in a  .......<br>
carrier medium; and<br>
(b)  a second part which is miscible with the first part and which comprises a second reagent in a carrier medium;..-, wherein "the first reagent and the .second reagent will 20  react when mixed to provide a sterilising composition;<br>
the first part being contained in a dispenser whereby it may be dispensed as a fluid, and the second part being absorbed or impregnated in a plurality of sterilising wipes each of which comprises a fabric member in a sealed 25  container; and<br>
(III)	a plurality of rinse wipes, each rinse wipe<br>
comprising a moist, sterile, fabric member in its own sealed<br>
container.<br>
  The system enables an item such as a flexible endoscope to be decontaminated without the use of a conventional washer-disinfector and, indeed, without a water supply. Each of the three wipes performs one stage of the<br><br>
decontamination process.  The chemistry of the rinse wipe may be tailored or selected to give optimal surface rinsing for a given sterilant system.  For example, the rinse wipe may include an agent for neutralising an active ingredient of the 5  sterilant system (^sterilising wipe')-  In a preferred embodiment the 'sterilising wipe has ClOs as the active ingredient and ;the rinse wipe contains an antioxidant such as sodium thiosulphate for neutralising excess of C102.<br>
  In prior art decontamination processes, ie, in washer-disinfectors, which use filtered mains water or water produced by reverse osmosis, or in a manual procedure in which tap water or bottled sterile water may be used, the water is indiscriminate to the chemistry employed in the<br>
  disinfection process.  Consequently the sterilant may be<br>
insufficiently removed by rinsing, or an undesirable excess of rinse water may be required.<br>
The fabric members may be formed from any suitable fabrics, 20  either woven t&gt;r non-woven.  They may be of natural or man-made fibres, for example polyester, cotton, cellulose or mixtures thereof.  Other suitable fabrics will be well known to those skilled in the textile or fabric arts. The fabric members for each of the three types of wipe may be same or 25  different from each other.<br>
Pre-ClÂ«an WipÂ«<br>
The pre-clean wipe is moist and preferably provided in a   sealed container.  The container may be resealable, for<br>
example a canister with a lid, or a resealable sachet. In a preferred embodiment, each pre-clean wipe is provided in its own sachet which may be factory-sealed and disposed of after<br><br>
use.<br>
It is preferred that the pre-clean wipe contain additional components to improve its efficiency.  The wipe may contain 5  at least one surfactant to promote wetting and/or dissolution of organic deposits.  The surfactant may be a foaming surfactant such as a detergent or a soap, or a low-foam non-ionic surfactant such as Lanawet LF-6.  The pre-clean wipe may advantageously contain other agents, for example one or 10  more selected from the following: enzymes for digesting or solubilising organic deposits, humectants, buffers, preservatives, corrosion inhibitors, solvents, or anti- . foaming agents.<br><br>
15  St.eri.lant .Systam<br>
The term ^ fluid' is used herein to include liquids, foams., sprays, pastes, aerosols, powders, sols and gels. It is particularly preferred that the 'first part of the sterilant<br>
  system is dispensed as a foam or a spray to facilitate its.<br>
coverage of a desired area of the fabric member.  Optionally, the .dispenser may have a relatively large dispensing head, for supplying the fluid over all or a substantial part of a surface of .the fabric member.  For example, the dispensing<br>
  head may take the form of a rose or sprinkler with a<br>
multitude of small orifices to spread the fluid over the fabric member.<br>
The dispenser is preferably a pump-dispenser, notably a 30  trigger-operated dispenser, both for convenience and to<br>
facilitate the dispensing of metered quantities.  However, other pump dispensers could be used, for example, a squeeze bottle with a suitable spray or foam nozzle.  The invention<br><br>
will, for convenience, be described hereinafter with reference to the use of a trigger-operated dispenser, but it is to be understood that it is not limited to this embodiment. 5<br>
By putting up the first part in a trigger-operated dispenser, small quantities may be readily dispensed without risk of spillage.  Preferably the dispenser comprises a sprayer apparatus that provides the first part as a foam, so that it<br>
  is at least partly form-retaining and can be readily seen and manipulated.  We have also found that providing the first part in a foair. may have the beneficial effect of reducing the odour of chlorine dioxide when the wipe is activated.  The invention will for convenience be described with reference to<br>
  this preferred embodiment, but it will be understood that the invention is not limited to this embodiment.<br>
The trigger sprayer may include a mixing chamber to facilitate mizihg of the first part with air, for example as 20  described in United States patent number 5,337,929.<br>
By providing the second part absorbed in a fabric wipe, a sterilising wipe may readily be prepared by applying the first part to the fabric wipe.  The user may fold the wipe or 25  rub two halves together to facilitate mixing.  The wipes are particularly useful for cleaning, disinfecting, and sterilising surfaces and equipment, notably in a medical environment.<br>
  The first part may include a coloured component so that a<br>
visual indication of the coverage of the wipe with the first part can be made.<br><br><br>
In a preferred embodiment, at least one of the first and second parts is provided with ar: indicator reagent that changes colour to show that sufficient mixing has taken place.  Where the first part and the second part are of 5  different pE, the indicator may be a pH-sensitive indicator. Suitable indicators are well known to those skilled in the art, non-limiting examples including: phenol red, litmus, thymol blue, pentamethoxy red, tropeolin 00, 2,4-dinitrophenol, methyl yellow, methyl orange, bromophenol<br>
  blue, tetrabromophenol blue, alizarin sodium sulphonate, ct-naphthyl red, p-ethoxychrysoidine, bromocresol green, methyl red, bromocrescl purple, chlorophenyl red, bromothymol blue, p-nitrophenol, azolitmin, neutral red, rosalic acid, cresol red, a-naphtholphthalein, tropeolin 000, phenolphthale'U^et-<br>
  napntholbenzeiri, thymeIphthalein, nile blue, alizarin yellow, diazo violet, tropeolin "0, nitramin-e-, -pmrrer'-s- blue, trinitrobenzoic acid, and mixtures thereof.  It is preferred that the indicator is selected so that both parts are separately colourl&amp;ss 'and the -colour -develops -when the- two<br>
  parts are mixed.<br>
Alternatively, ar additionally, one or more fluorescent additives may be included so that the mixture fluoresces to indicate mixing.  Non-limiting examples of suitable 25  fluorescing agents include: 4-methylumbelliferone, 3,6-dihydrcxanthone, quinine, thioflavin, 1-napthol, harmine, coumarin, acridine orange, cotarmine, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The indicator (colour change or fluorescent) may be included 30  in either part.  Preferred proportions by weight are about '0.1 to 10%, notably about 0.5 to 2%.<br>
The carrier mediums may be fluids such as liquids or sols, or<br><br>
they may be more form-retaining or viscous compositions such as gels or pastes.  It is preferred that at least one reagent is present in an aqueous fluid, although other additives may of course be present.  Preferably both reagents are put up in 5  aqueous fluids.<br>
The trigger-operated dispenser may be a conventional atomizer or foamer, or other manual pump in which the contents are expelled manually by operation of the trigger by the user. 10  Alternatively, the dispenser may contain a propellant to<br>
dispense the contents when operation of the trigger opens a valve, as is well known in applications such as shaving foam canisters and the like.  Suitable dispensers will be well Icnown to those skilled in the art. 15<br>
The preferred sterilising agent is chlorine dioxide, which may be formed from suitable known reagents.  In a preferred embodiment one reagent is a chlorite (notably sodium chlorite) and the other is an acid, preferably with a buffer. 20  Suitable acids include lactic acid, citric acid, boric acid, phosphoric acid, acetic acid, sorbic acid, ascorbic acid, hydrochloric acid or mixtures thereof.  In a preferred embodiment a mixture of acids is used, notably a mixture of citric, sorbic and boric acids. 25<br>
A particularly preferred system is as described in EP 0 785 719, with the corrosion inhibitors optionally not included, and with other additives as desired for particular applications.  In addition to suitable indicators, optional 30  additives include foam-promoting agents or stabilizers,<br>
humectants, essential oils and fragrances.  Other sterilising agents may alsobe employed; for example chlorine or oxygen. Chlorine may be produced by reaction between a hypochlorite<br><br><br><br><br>
such  as   sodiurt: hypochlorite,   and  a  suitable  acid  or buffer. Oxygen may be produced by reaction between a peroxide  and  a catalyst  such as  catalase,   optionally in  the presence  of  a buffer.     For convenience  hereinafter,   the invention will be described with reference to  chlorine  dioxide  as  the sterilising agent.<br><br>
Suitable  foam promoters will be well  icnown to those, skilled in the  art.    Non-limiting examples include:   sodium lauretli<br>
     sulphate,   ammonium lauryl  sulphate,   cocamide DBA, cocamidopropyl betaine,   sodium lauryl  sarcosinate, cocamidopropylamine  oxide,   monoethanolamine lauryl  sulphate, cocamidopropyl hydr-oxysultaine,   cocoyl  sarcosinate.     -Ani.onic, cationic,   non-ionic., and amphoteric surfactants may be     -   "-â€¢â€¢<br>
     emplo}7ed  depending on the  chemistry of the reagents.     The<br>
foam -promoters are 'Selected to provide  a stable  foam<br>
structure.     The foam promoter may -comprise from about   0.1 to<br>
50% by weight  of the first part,   notably from about  1  to 10%,<br>
preferably -from about  3-to  6-%.--	'		 -   "<br><br>
Suitable foam stabilizers  well  known to those  skilled in the art may also be used,   in proportions  similar to those  for the foam-promoters.    Non-limiting examples  include: alkanolamides,   for  example monoethanolamides and<br>
     diethanolamides,   amine  oxides,   betaines,   protein hydrolysates and cellulose derivatives  such as  carboxymethylcellulose.<br>
In a preferred embodiment,   a humect ant  is  included in  at least  one  of the  first  and second parts.     Humectants  serve to 30     reduce the rate of evaporation of components  and  improve product  feel if direct  skin contact  is  involved.     We have found that the use of a humectant reduces the volatility of chlorine  dioxide,   which reduces the  odour  of  chlorine  dioxide<br><br><br>
and prolongs "he life of the activated mixture.  Won-limit ing examples of suitable humectants include sodium lactate and polyols, for example glycerine, sorbitol, propylene glycol, diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol. The huiuectant may be 5  present in any desired amount, particularly from about 0.1 to 50% by weight, notably from about 0.5 to 10-%, preferably from about 1 to 3%. â€¢<br>
Where one of the reagents is basic or oxidising, for example   sodium chlorite, it is particularly preferred that this<br>
reagent is provided in the trigger dispenser rather than in the wipe, because such reagents may react with the fabric over time.  Preferably the optional humectant is included in the first part, with the sodium chlorite or other first 15  reagent.<br>
The first and/or second part may further include a biocide to ensure that, in the event of poor mixing of the parts, a biocidal effect is still present. The first and/or second 20  part may also include a preservative.<br>
Equal weights of the first part and the second part may provide, when nixed, a sterilising composition having a pH of from 1.0 to 10.5, but it is preferred that the composition 25  has a pH of from 4.5 to 6.5 as this may result in a more stable compound.<br>
A plurality of fabric members may be provided in a single resealable container, for example a canister with a lid, or a 30  resealable sachet.  In a preferred embodiment, each fabric member is provided in its own sachet which may be factory-sealed and disposed of after use.  In a particularly preferred embodiment, each sealed sachet contains a single<br><br><br>
fabric wipe anc carries a removable adhesive label on its outer surface, the label containing informatiorj about the provenance of the wipe, for example its lot or batch number, its date of manufacture, or its expiry date.  The label may 5  be affixed to E record sheet and used as part of an audit trail tc pro\Tide a record that an item of equipment has been properly decontaminated and the date on which this was done. In one embodiment the label adhesive and the record sheet are selected so that, though the label is releasably adhered to<br>
  the sachet, it will become permanently adhered to the record sheet and cannot be removed intact.  This arrangement helps provide a permanent validation record of the decontamination process.  The record sheet may be provided in any convenient form, for example as a single sheet, as part of a loose^i&amp;arf<br>
  binder, or in an audit trail book.<br>
It will be understood that the sterilant system may optionally be provided as a stand-alone sterilant system, for use without the pre-clean wipe or the rinse wipe, or for use 20  as a replacement component in the decontaminant system.<br>
Rinse Wipe<br>
To maintain sterility of the wipes it is preferred that  each 25     fabric member is provided in its  own  sachet which is  factory-sealed and disposed of after use.     The   sachets may be  gamma-irradiated before or after sealing to ensure sterility.<br>
In addition to water   (preferably deionised water) ,   optional 30     components may comprise an antioxidant to neutralise  oxidant in the sterilant  system,   a sequestering agent to   sequester metal  salts  and improve cleaning,   and a lubricant to provide visual enhancement,   or   "shine'   to  a  decontaminated item such<br><br><br>
as an entioscope.  A preservative may optionally be included, to eliminate roxic residues and enhance product stability prior to gamma-irradiation.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The pump dispenser 2  shown in Figure  1  is a trigger sprayer of a  construction well  known per se.     The dispenser 2 comprises  a body 24  connected to a  sprayer head   4  by  an internally  screw-threaded connector ring 14.     A  spray nozzle<br>
     10 in the head is  connected to an aqueous liquid 12 by means of a dip tube 6.     A user dispenses  the  liquid 12  through the nozzle 10 by operation  of a trigger  8.     Rotation  of the nozzle allows the user to  dispense the  fluid as   either   a<br><br><br>
spray of fine droplets or as a foam.<br>
In the present example, the liquid 12 (first part) comprises 0.75% of a first reagent (sodium chlorite), 3.0% foam 5  promoter (Cocamidopropyl Betaine).  The remainder is<br>
deionised water.  In this specification, all parts are by weight unless otherwise indicated.  Operation of the trigger 8 dispenses the first part 12 as a foam.<br>
  An alternative design of pump dispenser 2 is illustrated in Figure 3.  The trigger B is formed integrally with the nozzle 10.  Depressing the trigger 8 dispenses a portion of the fluid contents as a foam (referred to as the "Activator Foam' because it activates the sterilising powers of a sterilising<br>
  wipe) .  A protective cap 26 is provided to cover the nozzle 10 and trigger 8 when not in use.<br>
Turning now to :Figures 2 and 4, a scalable container 20 is also of a construction well known per se. The container 20<br>
  is a hollow cylinder fitted with a cap 22.  The container 20 contains a roll of interleaved fabric sheets (or ^sterilising wipes') 18.  In this example, the fabric sheets 18 are to be used as sterilising wipes, but it will be understood that the sheets 18 could also be used for other applications such as<br>
  biocidal wound-dressings.<br>
The cap 22 has a central opening through which a tip of the central wipe 18 is disposed.  By pulling the central wipe 18, a user may remove this wipe from the container, leaving the 30  next wipe in its place.  A stopper 16 is provided on the cap 22 for releasably sealing the container 20.<br>
In this example, the wipes 18 are impregnated with an aqueous<br><br><br>
acid solution (second part).  In t.his example, the acid solution comprises 0.5% citric acid, 0.05% sorbic acid, 0.05% boric acic.  The solution also comprises 0.35% of a buffer (trisodium phosphate). The solution also comprises 0.25% 5  tr is odium citrate, 1.0% glycerine, 0.1% beuzotriazoie, 0.1% sodium molybdate and 0.3% sodium nitrate. The remainder is deionised water.<br>
The pump dispenser 2 and container 20 together comprise the 10  sterilant system.  To activate a sterilising wipe, a user removes the wipe IB from the container 20, and applies a portion of foam from the dispenser 2 to the wipe 18.  To facilitate mixing of the reagents in the foam and the wipe., the user may fold the wipe in half and crush or rub the...*-3^. 15  folded wipe before opening it our.  Preferably, one of the components is provided -with -a p-Kâ€”sen-s-iti-v-e indicator-'w-hich<br>
changes colour or becomes coloured when adequate mixing has<br>
%<br>
occurred, thereby indicating that sufficient ClOs has been<br>
generated in-the 'wipe.	._^_.	.....^-<br><br>
Once the sterilising wipe has been activated, it may be used for a number of applications, including wiping surfaces and sterilising medical equipment such as endoscopes.<br>
  The sterilant system illustrated in Figures 1-4 may be<br>
accompanied by a plurality of pre-clean wipes and a plurality of rinse wipes for treatment of an item to be de-contaminated respectively before and after treatment with a sterilising wipe.  Each wipe may be made from the same fabric and may<br>
  have the same dimensions.  All of the wipes may be identical except for the fluid with which they are impregnated or soaked.<br><br>
In the preferred embodiment  illustrated in  Figures   5-8,   each sterilising wipe  is provided in  its  own sealed  container  20, in this  example  a  sachet.     The  disinfectant  system  comprises Â£ box  32   of pre-clean  wipes  in  sachets  30,   a  box  28   of 5      sterilising wipes  in  sachets  20,   and a box 34   of  rinse  wipes in sachets  40.     Each  sachet 20,   30,   40 is  factory-sealed  and may be disposed of after the wipe  has been removed.     The  foam pump  dispenser 2  is  also provided in the box  28   of sterilising wipe sachets  20<br><br><br><br><br>
Each  sachet 20,   30,   40  is provided with a label   48   on the front,   identifying what  the relevant wipe is  for.     A label  50 on the back gives information about how the wipe  is to be used and other product details.<br>
In this example,   the pre-clean wipes contain the   fluid formulation set forth in Table 1.<br><br><br>

RINSE WIPE FORMULATION TABLE 2<br>
Sodium thiosulphate is -an antioxidant which helps to remove 15  traces of C102 from an item that has been sterilised.  EDTA sodium salt is a seguestrant for removing dissolved metal salts and improving cleaning.  The silicone emulsion functions as a lubricant to help 'shine' an item such as an endoscope and provide visual enhancement.  The preservative 20  is added before the rinse wipes are gamma-irradiated, to help, reduce or eliminate toxic residue and enhance product stability prior to irradiation.<br>
To decontaminate an item (in this example an endoscope), a 25  user first opens a pre-clean wipe sachet 30 and takes out the pre-clean wipe.  This wipe is used to remove soil and debris from the surface of the endoscope, in accordance with<br><br><br>
instructions on the label 50 of the sachet 30.  After pre-cleaning, the pre-clean wipe is disposed of, and the user activates a sterilising wipe 16 by removing it from its sachet 20 and applying a metered dose of foam from the 5  dispenser 2 (in this example, two measures of foam activator are applied in. accordance with instructions on the label 50 on the back of the sachet 20) .  After manipulating the wipe 18 to ensure mixing of the activator foam and the fluid in the wipe 18, the user waits about 15 seconds and then wipes 10  the surface of the endoscope for about 30 seconds.  Finally, a rinse wipe sachet 40 is opened and a rinse wipe is used to wipe down the surface of the endoscope.  The endoscope is now decontaminated and ready for use.<br>
  Referring now to Figure B, a record sheet 36 is illustrated for use in prox*iding a quality audit trail for an item of equipment decontaminated with an embodiment of the system of the present invention.  The record sheet 36 may be loose or it may be bound in a book or file.  The record sheet carries<br>
  boxes or other defined locations for recordal of information relating to the: decontamination of the item.  In the present example spaces are defined for recording the type of device .to be decontaminated, its reference number, its method of decontamination, and other details including the ID number of<br>
  the patient on which the device has most recently been used, the date and time of decontamination, and the name and signature of the responsible person.  The record sheet permits recording of the pre-clean wipe process, the 'sterilising process, and the rinse wipe process.  It also<br>
  provides information as to the immediate destination of the decontaminated item - either for use with the patient or return to storage.<br><br><br>
For  each   decontamination  history   of   each  device   on  the   record sheet  36 there is provided a  space  42  for receiving Â£  record book label  38  from the  back of  the   sterilising wipe  sachet 20.     The  user peels  the   sticky label   38   off the  sachet  and 5     affixes  it in the  space   42  as proof that the  sterilising  wipe IB  has been used,   and marks  adjacent  boxes to  confirm that "he wipe  IE has been properly activated by following the specified steps.     If the  decontaminated device is  to be returned for use on the  specified patient,   this  information<br>
     is  recorded on zhe record sheet.     Alternatively,   i'f the<br>
device is to be returned to storage,   a second sticky label, the   'patient's notes  label7   46  is peeled off the   sterilising wipe  sachet 20 and affixed in another box 44  on the record sheet  36.     This embodiment of-the  invention therefore<br>
     provides  a traceability system which uses the  sterilising wipe  sachet "20 as  evidence that the wipe -has -been used as a single-use process,   uniquely identified to a  specific instrument -at a specific time and date.<br>
     EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS Experiment  1<br>
Sterising wipes  18   in accordance .with one aspect   of the 25     invention were tested and compared with conventional wipes saturated with isopropanol   (IPA),   a  general-purpose detergent,   and sterile  deionised water.<br>
The test method to  evaluate effectiveness of the wipes  in 30     killing/removing test  organisms  dried onto test   surfaces, involved the following steps.<br>
1.       Mark out  a  six  inch   (30.5  cm)   square test   area  on the<br><br><br><br>
test surface.<br>
2.	Inoculate the test surface with 0.5 ml of test organism<br>
suspension.<br><br>
3.	Spread the inoculum over the test area using a plastic<br>
spreader.<br>
4.	Allow the inoculum to dry (about 30 minutes) .<br><br>
.<br>
Don a pair of disposable plastic gloves.<br>
6.	Prepare a ClOj wipe in accordance with the invention,<br>
using a prescribed mixing time.<br><br>
7.	Wipe the test area for the prescribed wiping time.<br>
8.	Place the wipe in 10 ml of universal neutraliser in a<br>
Universal bottle (Test Suspension A) . Vortex stir to release<br>
  organisms.<br>
9.	Wipe the entire test area with a cotton-tipped swab<br>
(thoroughly/10 times) .<br>
  10.  Dip the swab into 10 ml of universal neutraliser in a Universal bottle after each sampling of the test area and rotate the swab against the inner wall of the bottle to release organisms (Test Suspension B) .<br>
  11.  Prepare 5 serial deci-dilutions of Test Suspension A and Test Suspension B in diluent.<br>
12.  Inoculate 0.5 ml of each dilution onto a culture plate<br><br><br>
	and spread using a plastic spreader.  Incubate rne plates and<br>
	ao a viable count.<br>
13.  Calculate iogaD reductions achieved from the difference 5  in the initial inoculum and the number of test organisms recovered after disinfection with a C102 wipe.<br>
Test variables were as follows.  Test Surface<br>

TABLE 1 VC = Viable Count<br>
  Interpretation of Results<br>
1.  Washing/wiping with water, neutral detergent '(1% Bospec), or alcohol (70% 1PA) were ineffective<br>
  2.  For the notional 200 ppm C1Q2 wipes the best results were obtained with a mixing time of 15 seconds and a wiping<br>
time of 60 seconds.<br>
3.	For the notional 3.0"0 ppm CIDa wipes the "best results, ~<br>
  were obtained with a mixing time of 30 seconds and a wiping<br>
time of 60 seconds.<br>
4.	Results for 200 ppm C102 (notional) were surprisingly<br>
better than results for 300 ppm (notional) , except for mixing<br>
  times of 30 seconds combined with wiping times of -at least 30 seconds.<br>
5.	A wiping time of 60 seconds achieved better results than<br>
a wiping time of 30 seconds, which in turn achieved better<br>
  results than a wiping time of 15 seconds.<br>
6.  Both C102 concentrations achieved good results after a wiping time of 60 seconds.  The test surface was inoculated with 1 x 10s spores. After using the C102 wipes, surface 30  counts were reduced to 10 and 29 (200 ppm C102) and to 160 and 20 (300 ppin C102) .<br><br><br>
7.   A wipe containing 200 or 300 ppm may be useful, as may mixing times of 15 or 30 seconds (or, clearly, any intermediate times).  However, it is preferred that wiping rimes longer than 15 seconds are employed.<br><br><br><br>
These results were obtained using bacterial spores.  It is to be expected that a vegetative bacterium such as MRSA will be much more sensitive, so that lower ClOj concentrations and/or shorter mixing or wiping times may be effective against such bacteria.<br><br>
Further experiments (2-4) were carried out using 41 gsm spunlace sheets comprised of 50.5% wood pulp and 49.5% PET.<br>
  The sheets' dimensions were 160 mm x 180 mm x 0.36 mm.  In each experiment the wipes each contained 3 ml of Solution A (formulated as set forth below) , made by treating a canister of 50 wipes with 150 ml of Solution A.  Each wipe was activated with 1.5 ml of Solution B (formulated as set forth<br>

The insertion tube was 1 metre long, in good condition, with clear markings. The test site used was the 10 cm section between the 30 and 40 markings.<br>
     Test Method<br>
1. Immerse a cotton-tipped swab into a suspension of spores or vegetative cells.<br><br><br>
2.   Inoculate entire surface area of test sire with the suspension. Repeat several times. Regarding Â£. .subtilis spores, assume that (1) the volume of inoculum = 0.1 ml, and [2] the mortality rate on drying out is sero. Hence the 5  viable count of 'the inoculum - approximately 10e spores.<br>
Regarding P* aeruginosa .cells, assume that (1) the volume of inoculum = C.I ml, and (2) the mortality rate on drying out is 1 log. Hence the viable count of the inoculum = approximately 10e cells.<br>
  3.   Place inoculated insertion tube across the top of an<br>

cells were  recovered in duplicate  experiments. 15     2.       IPA wipes exhibited good activity  against P.   aeruginosa<br>
cells but did not  eliminate all of the  test  cells  -  40 viable<br>
cells were  recovered from the test  site  on the insertion<br>
tube.<br>
3.  IPA wipes were ineffective against B. subtilis spores. 20  IPA proved less effective than 1% Hospec or water which may<br><br><br>
be attributable to the coagulant properties of alcohol ('fixing spores on the test site) .<br>
.   Wipes saturated with 1% Hospec were ineffective against either B. suJbtilis spores or P. aeruginosa cells. 5  5.   Wipes saturated with water were ineffective against either B. snbtilis spores or P. aeruginosa cells.<br>

Interpretation of results<br>
1.	Wiping with a CIO; Wipe for 30 seconds was completely<br>
effective.  No test organisms were recovered from either the<br>
  test surface or the wipes in duplicate experiments.<br>
2.	Wiping the test surface with a 70% IPA wipe (Azowipe)<br>
for 30 seconds was ineffective. This could be due to:<br>
(a)	an exposure time of 30 seconds was not long enough to<br>
  kill the MRSA<br>
(b)	the IPA evaporated off the test surface before the<br>
minimum exposure time required to kill the MRSA<br>
(c)	the volume of IPA on the wipe was insufficient to<br>
deal with the &gt;10S MRSA dried onto the 18 inch test surface<br>
  (d)    a combination of the above.<br>
3.	Only 360 test organisms were recovered from the<br>
Azowipe. This could be due to :<br>
(a) entrapment of test organisms in the fibres<br>
  (b) incomplete/ slow neutralisation of the residual IPA on the wipe by the<br>
neutraliser (c) a combination of the above<br>
  4.   Wipes saturated-with either 1% Hospec or sterile water were ineffective.<br>

Interpretation of results<br>
1.	Spores dried out for 24 h at room temperature on a<br>
stainless steel test surface were not easy to dislodge using<br>
a Medical Wipe saturated with deionised water. With the 106<br>
inoculum the recovery was 4.0-8.4 x 103 spores leaving 2-3<br>
logio spores on the surface (assuming no mortality). With the<br>
106 inoculum the recovery was 1.3 -7.6 x 106 spores leaving 1-<br>
2 logic spores on the surface.<br>
2.	C102 Wipes were effective in killing/ removing spores<br>
dried out for 24 h at room temperature on the stainless steel<br>
test surface. With the 106 inoculum, no spores were recovered<br>
from either the surface or wipe which represents a 3-4 Iog10<br>
reduction on both the surface and wipe. With the 108<br><br><br>
inoculum, a 2-2 logic, reduction of spores was achieved on the surface anc a 3-4 logic reduction on the wipe.<br>
Thus., the invention provides e decontamination system which 5 can be prepared in sitv and which provides bactericidal, fungicidal, virucidal, and sporicidal fabrics. The system is particularly useful for sterilising wipes and for the dressing of wounds and ulcers.<br>
