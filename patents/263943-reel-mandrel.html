				<td>REEL   MAITOREL<br>
The invencion relates to a reel mandrel for v;inding shee metal, in particular rolled hot strip, comprising a mandrel body preferably configured as hollow-cylindrical, a spreading bar which can be adjusted relative to the mandrel body in the axial direction and a n-umber of segments which are radially adjustable by axial movement of the spreading bar relative to the mandrel body, wherein a number of fishplates hinge-mounted to the spreading bar and the segments are arranged between the spreading bar and the segments.<br>
(-<br>
Reel mandrels of this type are used to wind in particular metal strip after production or refining to form a coil.<br>
Known from EP 0 413 985 Bl is a reel mandrel for straight-edged winding of or unwinding of metal strip to form a coil or from a coil, in particular for winding rolled hot strip, comprising a driven reel mandrel which is supported so as to be rotatable, substantially consisting of a mandrel body, segments and spreading bar, wherein the segments can be spread in the r-^Hial direction with the intermediary of the spreading bar which is movable axially in the mandrel body and a coupling of a drive rotating vjith the reel mandrel, which is movable with the spreading bar. In this case, the coupling is arranged with a play corresponding to the spreading of the reel mandrel between an emergency de-spreading device and the housing of the hydraulic drive, wherein the emergency de-spreading device and the housing of the hydraulic drive are immovable with respect to the mandrel body in the axial direction and wherein the movement of the coupling in the sense of a reduction in the diameter of the reel mandrel is lim.ited by the emergency de-spreading device and the emergency de-spreading device<br><br>
makes it possible to additionally release the axial mobility of :;he spreading bar connected to the coupling by a certain amount of distance. Such a reel mandrel satisfactorily fulfils its allotted task of winding hot strip.<br>
DE 103 47 262 B3 discloses a grease distribution systerr. for a reel mandrel v;hereby the grease distributors are arranged in a grease distribution ring which is flange-mounted to the mandrel shaft at its end face and which is provided with channels which are connected to axial bores arranged in the mandrel shaft, said bores leading directly and/or via cross-bores to the lubrication points. The reel to be designated as a standard reel mandrel in this document further consists of a mandrel body, a spreading bar with fishplates for holding the segments. A shaft is screwed onto the end face of the mandrel body to which a roller bearing with housing is attached. This unit is then supported by a pivotable holder. The pivotable holder (hereinafter called mandrel mounting] grips around the roller bearing with its housing from two sides and supports this during the winding process. During removal of the coil the mandrel mounting pivots away from the roller bearing and its housing and thus e:xposes the path for removal of the '"i^'i 1<br>
The mandrel body is configured as open at the front so that the spreading bar with the fishplates and the pressure plates to the segments can be mounted inside the mandrel body.<br>
This design allows the spreading bar, the fishplates and the pressure plates to be mounted easily. The rigidity of this design is sufficient for the usual loading.<br>
As a result of the increasing tendency to roll and wind increasingly higher-strength steels,  the requirement for<br><br>
the reel mandrel of a hot-strip train will increase substantially. The loading can easily be between twice and three times the loading compared with a standard reel mandrel.<br>
.An example cf these high-strength steels are the tube q-aality stages according to the American API standard grade 3 and the quality stages X42 to A30. At present, the tube q-aality stages XlOO to X120 are being developed and beginning to be used. These materials constitute a completely new development. They should satisfy the requirement for higher strength, improved corrosion resistance and an increase in the collapse resistance (for marine use).<br>
The object of the present invention is thus to increase the stiffness of a reel mandrel of the genre specified initially and to thus provide a reel mandrel for winding high-strength and super high-strength steels.<br>
This object is achieved whereby when mounted, at least a number of fishplates of the reel mandrel pass through recesses in the mandrel body which are inserted in the mandrel body such that this is at least free from recesses at its axial end.<br>
Preferably all the fishplates pass through recesses in the mandrel body which are inserted in the mandrel body such that this is free frcm recesses at its axial ends.<br>
As a result of the configuration of the mandrel body provided according to the invention, which is closed at the end face and free from recesses, a substantially more rigid reel structure is obtained, as will be seen in detail.<br><br>
At least some of the recesses can be configured as rectangular openings in the mandrel body when viewed from above.<br>
The mandrel body mostly has a substantially cylindrical outer contour. At least one axial end of the mandrel body, preferably both axial ends of the mandrel body, is preferably free from recesses over an axial extension. It has proved effective if it is provided that this axial extension is at least 10%, preferably at least 15% of the outside diameter of the mandrel body.<br>
Preferably four recesses for passage of fishplates are distributed uniformly over the circumference of the mandrel body.<br>
The advantageous inventive concept can be used particularly effectively if special measures are taken for mounting the mandrel body. Accordingly, it is advantageously provided that at least one fishplate is pivotally mounted at a hinge point in the spreading bar, wherein the axis of the hinge point is arranged transversely to the axial direction of the spreading bar and wherein the end of the fishplate is arranged in a recess incorporated in the outer ■"■ircumf crcncc c~~ the S'^readinc bar. The -rer-^ss is preferably arranaed in an axial end of the spreading bar. Furthermore, a particularly simple possibility for mounting is obtained if it is further provided that the recess is configured in radial section such that the tangent at its one axial end points in the axial direction of the spreading bar.<br>
According to the invention, by suitable desig:. modifications to the spreading bar, the fishplates, the mandrel body and by changing the mounting sequence, the mandrel body is thus configured as closed at the front end to allow a higher loading capacity.<br><br>
This yields the following advantages:<br>
The mandrel body is overall stiffer (no more open profile).<br>
The linking of the rriandrel extension is better because larger pitch circle diameters for the draw-in bolts and more dra"^.'.'-in bolts are possible.<br>
An improvement in the centring of the mandrel extensioii can be achieved, i.e.:<br>
a)	The centring area is closed.<br>
b)	The centring has become larger in diameter.<br>
c)	As a result of the above points the area has become larger and the structure has become more rigid. The loading has thus been reduced.<br>
The end faces of the mandrel body and the mandrel extension are configured as more rigid (mandrel about 80% and mandrel extension about 5% improvement). The efficiency of the draw-in bolts has thus been improved.<br>
The wear plates of the mandrel segments are now supported on the closed mandrel body and no longer via the mandrel extension. The load on the draw-in bolts is thus reduced.<br>
Overall, a substantially more stable reel arrangement is obtained, which is suitable for reeling strong and high-strength strip.<br>
The drawings show exemplary embodiments according to the prior art and according to the invention. In the figures:<br>
Fig. 1    is a radial section through a part of a reel mandrel according to the prior art.<br><br>
Fig. 2    shows one axial end of the mandrel body of the<br>
reel mandrel according to Fig. 1, Fig. 3    shows the view B of rhe reel mandrel according to<br>
Fig. 2, Fig. 4    is a diagrair. O'f -rihs mandrel body according to the<br>
invention similar to Fig. 2, Pig. 5    shows the view C of the reel mandrel according to<br>
Fig. 4, Fig. 6    shows the axial end section of the mandrel i^ody,<br>
the spreading bar and a segment of a reel mandrel<br>
in radial section according to the prior art and Fig. 7    is a diagram of a reel mandrel according to the<br>
invention similar to Fig. 6.<br>
Figures 1 to 3 illustrate a previously known solution. The reel mandrel 1 shown comprises a mandrel body 2 configured as substantially cylindrical, in which a spreading bar 3 is arranged so that it can be displaced in the axial direction A relative to the mandrel body 2. A plurality of segments 4 are arranged displaceably i.e. so that they can be spread, around the mandrel body 2. During the axial displacement of the spreading bar 3 relative to the mandrel body 2, wedge-shaped run-in surfaces on the spreading bar, which are not shown, ensure that the segments 4 are pressed radially outwards. For details reference is made to EP 0 413 985 Bl in which this known embodiment is described in detail. The radial withdrawal of the segments during the axial movement of the spreading bar 3 in the opposite direction is ensured by fishplates 5 which are arranged on the spreading rod 3 and on the segments 4 in a hinged manner. This is also illustrated and described in further detail in said EP 0 413 985 Bl.<br>
A shaft 14 is screwed onto the front end of the mandrel body 2, a roller bearing with housing being mounted thereon. In Fig. 1 the bolting surface 15 of the shaft 14 (also designated as a mandrel extension) is shown on the<br><br>
mandrel body 2. The receptacle £or che roller bearing is designated by 16. The front end of the shaft 14 contacts the segments 14 via pressure plates 17.<br>
The entire unit is then supported by a pivotable holder The pivotable holder (also called mandrel mounting) grips from two sides around the roller bearing with its housing (not shown) and supports this during the -A-inding process. During removal of the wound coil the miandrel mounting pivots avjay from the roller bearing and its housing and thus exposes the path for removal of the coil.<br>
As can be seen in Figures 2 and 3, the mandrel body 2 is configured as open at the front, i.e. at the front: end, so that the spreading bar 3 with the fishplates 5 secured thereon can be mounted in the mandrel body 2. Simple mounting is thus ensured by the recesses 6 which are incorporated in the axial end 7 of the mandrel body 2.<br>
A relatively severe weakening of the axial end of the mandrel body 2 is thus disadvantageously obtained so that the reel mandrel is limited in its rigidity. The reeling of high-strength strip material is thus only possible to a limited extent with such a reel mandrel.<br>
To avoid this disadvantage, the invention provides the solution sketched in Figures 4 and 5. In this case, the axial end 7 of the mandrel body 2 is free from recesses 6. Rather, these are only provided after a first axial extension x - measured in the axial direction - and are provided as openings in the hollow-cylindrical wall of the mandrel body 2. In this case, the axial extension x is located at at least 10% of the outside diameter D of the mandrel body 2. At the same time, the recesses 6 as shown in Fig. 4 have a substantially rectangular contour.<br><br>
The following configuration is provided to ensure simple mounting of the reel mandrel:<br>
In the prior art {see Fig. S), the individual fishplates 5 are positioned with one end 10 at a hinge point 8 with the axis 9 cf the hinged joint in a recess 11. The recess 11 has a trough-shaped contour in radial section. The fishplates 5 project upvjards during assembly so that the spreading bar 3 with fishplates 5 secured thereto can be inserted into the mandrel body 2. This is made possible by the open configuration of the mandrel body 2 at the front end.<br>
However, in the solution according to the invention such mounting is not possible sine the mandrel body 2 is closed at the front end. Thus, as can be seen in Fig, 7, the recess 11 for the hinge point 8 of the fishplate 5 is designed so that it is arranged in an axial end 12 of nhe spreading bar 3. It is further provided that the recess 11 is configured in radial section such that the tangent T at its one axial end 13 points in the axial direction A of the spreading bar 3. It thus becomes possible to position the fishplates 5 arranged on the spreading bar 3 during assembly as indicated by the reference numeral 5'. In this position the spreading bar 3 together with the fishplates 5 can be inserted into the mandrel body 2.<br>
The operating mode of the fishplates 5 is determined by the distances a (see Fig. 6) or b [see Fig. 7). The distance b is designed by the person skilled in the art such that there are no problems of collisions with other components during assembly and after insertion of the spreading bar 3 into the mandrel body 2, the fishplates 5 can be folded from the position 5' into the position designated by 5. The adjacent components fin particular, the shape and size of the recesses 6) are optionally designed accordingly.<br><br>
The advantage of the proposed arrangement is that chat the spreading bar 3 together with fishplates 5 secured thereon can now be mounted easily.<br>
The proposed reel rfiandrel 1 is exceptionally suitable for winding high-strength and super high-strength materials.<br>
