Further, inventors of the present invention disclosed herbicidal phenoxypropionic acid N-alkyl-N-2-fluorophenyl amide compounds in International Pat. Publication No. WO 2000/05956.(Figure Remove)Even though) many of herbicides for rice have been recently developed and used, barnyard grass among weeds is the biggest problem in rice paddy.<br>
Development of herbicides to control barnyard grass is an urgent to one who is in the field of agriculture. After transplanting young rice, herbicides, developed until now, cannot effectively control the production of barnyard grass so that it causes a huge damage to harvest. It has been reported that the<br>
amount of rice harvest is decreased by 2% when barnyard grass is produced 1 week per 1 m2, decreased by about 10% when produced 5 weeks per 1 m2, decreased by about 19% when produced 10 weeks per 1 m2and decreased by about 35% when produced 20 weeks per 1 m2.<br>
Many different kinds of herbicides have been used for the purpose of controlling barnyard grass that damages in amount of harvest of rice. However, the herbicide with a^ broader herbicidal activity, environment-friendly property and cost-effectiveneis is still in demand.<br>
The inventors have intensively studied to provide herbicides to effectively control barnyard grass, and particularly, to find out selective herbicidal activity of phenoxypropionic acid N-alkyl-N-2-fluorophenyl amide compounds of formula (6). As a result, we completed this invention by finding that some phenoxypropionic acid N-alkyl-N-2-fluorophenyl amides of formula (6) exist as (R)- of (S)-stereoisomer, and (R)-stereoisomers provide higher stability to rice and better herbicidal activity compared to (S)-stereoisomers or mixtures thereof. This superior activity of (R)-stereoisomers is distinguished from the conventional inventions.<br>
Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide optically active herbicide compounds which exhibit excellent selectivity toward rice and prevent the production of harmful barnyard grass.<br>
[Disclosure of Invention!<br>
The present invention is to provide optically active herbicide phenoxypropionic acid N-methyl-N-2-fluorophenyl amides of formula (1) with<br>

reaction mixture at 0°C. The mixture was stirred at 0°C for 30 minutes and stirred at room temperature for additional 1 hour. After pouring water the reaction mixture was extracted three times with ethyl acetate. The combined organic solvent layer was dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude product was purified by column chromatography(eluent: ethyl acetate/n-hexane=l/2) to afford 240 mg of the target product,<br>

The compounds represented in the following Table 2 were prepared by the same procedure of example 10 except using of aniline compounds instead of N-methy 1-2,3/6- trirluuroaniline.<br>
Table 2(Table Remove)Formulation<br>
In order to use the compounds according to the present invention as herbicides, they should be formulated in such a suitable type such as wettable powder, emulsions, granules, dusts, suspensions and solutions by combining a carrier, a surfactant, a dispersing agent or a supplement agent. Many of these may be applied directly or after diluted with suitable media. Formulations can be prepared at spray volume of from hundreds liters to thousands liters per hectare. The formulations contain about 0.1% to 99% by weight of active ingredient(s) and 0.1% to 20% surfactant(s) or 0% to 99.9% solid or liquid diluent(s) are recommended to be added. The formulations will contain these<br>
ingredients in the following approximate proportions shown in Table 3. Table 3(Table Remove)The proportion of active ingredients depends on the intended use. Higher ratio of a surfactant is sometimes desired to active ingredients and is achieved by incorporation into the formulation or tank mixing.<br>
Solid diluentH with high absorption are preferred for wettable powder. Liquid diluents and solvents are preferred to be stable against phase separation at 0°C. All the formulations may contain a small amount of additives to prevent forming, caking, corifosion and growth of microorganisms.<br>
According tp conventional methods to prepare the composition, solutions can be made only by blending ingredients and fine solids by blending and pulverizing with hammer-mill. Suspensions can be made by wet-milling and granules can bit made by spraying the active ingredients on performed granular carrier.<br>
Preparation eixamples of typical formulations are as follows.<br>
Formulation 1: Wettftble Powder<br>
The ingredients are thoroughly blended, re-blended after spraying liquid surfactant on Ijhe solid ingredients and hammer-milled until all the solids are essentially under 100 um.<br>
Active ingredient (Compound of Example 3) 20 wt.%<br>
Dodecylphenpl polyethylene glycol ether      2 wt.%<br>
Sodium ligninsulfonate	4 wt.%<br>
Sodium silicon aluminate	6 wt.%<br>
Montmorilloliite	68 wt.%<br>
Formulation 2: Wett^ble Powder<br>
The ingredients are blended, hammer-milled until all the solids are under 25 um and packaged.<br>
Active ingredient (Compound of Example 3)        80 wt. %<br>
Sodium a|kyl naphthalenesulfonate	2 wt.%<br>
Sodium lijgninsulfonate	2 wt. %<br>
Synthetic amorphous silica	3 wt.%<br>
Kaolinite	13 wt.%<br>
Formulation 3: Emulsion<br>

Cyclohexiimone	20 wt.%<br><br>
Polyoxyethylene alkylaryl ether	11 wt.%<br>
Calcium plkylbenzenesulfonate	4 wt.%<br>
Methylnaphthalene	35 wt.%<br>
Formulation 4: Granule<br>
The ingredients were thoroughly blended. 20 parts by weight of water was added to 100 ;parts of weight the ingredient mixture. The ingredient mixture was granulated with a size of 14 to 32 mesh by using extrusive granulator and dried.<br>
Active ingredient (Compound of Example 3)       5 wt.%<br>
Sodium Ijmrylalcoholsulfonate	2 wt.%<br>
Sodium Hgninsulfonate	5 wt.%<br>

The formulations according to this invention were sprayed with diluting to a certain concentration.<br>
Utility<br>
The compounds according to the present invention represent high activity as leaf treatment herbicides for rice and especially effective in rice due to an excellent control of barnyard grass.<br><br>
The active ingredients can be used from 10 g to 4 kg per hectare, preferably from 50 g to 400 g. The amount of the compounds of the present invention depends on the amount and size of weeds and formulations. The herbicides of the present invention can be used as alone or in combination with other herbicides, insecticides or bactericides. Especially it is essential to add one agent selected from the group consisting of bentazon, quinclorac, propanil, simetryn, 2,4-D, fen<l linuron mcpa azafenidin carfentrazone molinate thiobencarb pendimethalin bensulfuron-methyl pyrazosulfuron-ethyl metsulfurofi-methyl thifensulfuron-methyl tribenuron-methyl trifluralin amidosulfuron bromoxynil butachlor mecoprop metribuzin bifenox benfuresate isoproturon cyhalofop-butyl mefenaset fenrrazamide pyriminobac-methyl bispyribac sodium azimsulfruon cyclosulfamuron pyanchor and mixtures thereof.></l>
The herbiciclal effect of the compounds of this invention was tested and the examples are as follows.<br>
Experimental Example 1: Leaf Treatment Test<br>
Seeds of rice, wheat, barley, corn, cotton, barnyard grass, common sorgum, large crabgcass and fall panicum were seeded at a pot with a surface area of 600 cm2. Wheji barnyard grass grown in a green house kept at 20 - 30 °C had three leaves, weftable powder prepared by mixing 1 part by weight of the active compound, 5 parts by weight of acetone and 1 part by weight of emulsifier and diluted with water was applied directly to the leaves in 2000 L per hectare. The concentration of the spray liquid was so chosen the particular<br><br>
amounts of the active compound desired. 14 days after the treatment, the degree of damage to the plants was rated in % damage in comparison to the development of untreated control.<br>
0%	no effect (same as untreated control)<br>
20%	slight effect<br>
70%	herbicidal effect<br>
100%	total destruction<br>
In the test, the active compound(s) of formula (1) according to the invention exhibited an excellent selectivity toward the plants and herbicidal activity against weeds.<br>
(Table Remove)Among the compounds of formula (1), herbicidal activity of (R)-2-[4-<br>
chloro-2-benzoxa/.oy3oxy]-phenoxy]propionic	acid-N-(2-flurorophenyl)-N-<br>
methyl amide (Exaniple 3) was compared to the (S)-stereoisomer and racemic mixture thereof and the result is summarized in table 5.<br>
(Table Remove)Therefore, the optically active compounds of the present invention may be vtry effective in rice farming. Further, it is proved that the optically active comjpounds are very stable for wheat, barley, beans, and corn and useful to control weeds.<br><br><br><br>
