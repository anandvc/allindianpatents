				<td>AXLE TORQUE BASED CRUISE CONTROL<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application relates to U.S. Patent Application No.<br>
11/934,234, filed on November 2, 2007. The disclosure of the above application<br>
is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002] The present disclosure relates to coordinating torque requests<br>
between a plurality of torque requesting modules including a cruise control torque<br>
request, and in particular to determining the cruise control torque request.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The background description provided herein is for the purpose<br>
of generally presenting the context of the disclosure. Work of the presently<br>
named inventors, to the extent it is described in this background section, as well<br>
as aspects of the description that may not otherwise qualify as prior art at the<br>
time of filing, are neither expressly nor impliedly admitted as prior art against the<br>
present disclosure.<br>
[0004] Powertrain control systems include a plurality of modules that<br>
require a certain amount of engine torque to operate properly. For example, an<br>
automatic transmission control module may need to momentarily reduce torque<br>
from the engine in order to change transmission gears. Another example may be<br>
an air conditioning clutch control module that needs engine torque to be<br>
<br>
 <br>
increased a moment prior to engaging an air conditioning compressor clutch.<br>
The engine torque increase helps maintain a constant engine speed when the<br>
compressor clutch engages, particularly when the engine is idling.<br>
[0005] Conventionally, these various modules affect torque actuators<br>
directly. For example, the automatic transmission control module may retard a<br>
spark advance to the engine to reduce the engine torque during the shift.<br>
Similarly, the air conditioning clutch control module may increase the spark<br>
advance to increase the engine torque during the moment prior to engaging the<br>
compressor clutch.<br>
[0006] As vehicle powertrain systems include more modules and more<br>
actuators that affect torque, the architecture of the prior art becomes<br>
cumbersome to maintain and undesirably difficult to troubleshoot. As an<br>
example of more actuators, hybrid vehicles include an engine and an electric<br>
motor that provide torque. Integrating the hybrid vehicle powertrain to existing<br>
torque-modifying modules can be undesirably cumbersome with the existing<br>
powertrain control architecture.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0007] The present disclosure will become more fully understood from<br>
the detailed description and the accompanying drawings, wherein:<br>
[0008] FIG. 1 is a functional block diagram of a vehicle powertrain<br>
according to the present disclosure;<br>
 <br>
[0009] FIGs. 2A and 2B are a functional block diagram of a coordinated<br>
torque control system for the vehicle powertrain according to the present<br>
disclosure;<br>
[0010] FIG. 3 is a functional block diagram of a driver-side torque<br>
request module according to the present disclosure; and<br>
[0011] FIG. 4 is a flow diagram that illustrates steps of a rate limited<br>
axle torque method according to the present disclosure.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0012] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is in<br>
no way intended! to limit the disclosure, its application, or uses. For purposes of<br>
clarity, the same reference numbers will be used in the drawings to identify<br>
similar elements. As used herein, the phrase at least one of A, B, and C should<br>
be construed to mean a logical (A or B or C), using a non-exclusive logical or. It<br>
should be understood that steps within a method may be executed in different<br>
order without altering the principles of the present disclosure.<br>
[0013] As used herein, the term module refers to an Application<br>
Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit, a processor (shared,<br>
dedicated, or group) and memory that execute one or more software or firmware<br>
programs, a combinational logic circuit, and/or other suitable components that<br>
provide the described functionality.<br>
[0014] Referring now to FIG. 1, a functional block diagram is shown of<br>
a vehicle powertrain 20. Powertrain 20 includes an internal combustion engine<br>
22 that develops torque. The amount of torque is established by one or more<br>
<br>
 <br>
actuators 24 that control at least one of fuel, ignition, residual exhaust gas or<br>
exhaust recirculation (EGR), number of cylinders firing, and airflow, to engine 22<br>
in accordance with commands from a powertrain control module (PCM) 26. It<br>
should be appreciated that engine 22 may be a diesel engine, in which case<br>
ignition and air flow are not controlled by PCM 26; however, the fuel amount,<br>
injection timing, residual exhaust gas or EGR, and turbo boost could be<br>
controlled to control the amount of torque. For example, EGR and boost control<br>
the air flow indirectly by displacing air with exhaust gas in a cylinder charge. A<br>
crankshaft position sensor 28 generates a signal that indicates a speed of engine<br>
22. Exhaust from engine 22 passes through a catalyst 30. Torque from engine<br>
22 can be used for driving accessory loads. An air conditioning compressor 29 is<br>
an example of an accessory load. PCM 26 can employ a compressor clutch 31<br>
to selectively couple and decouple air conditioning compressor 29 from the<br>
engine torque. Other examples of accessory loads include an alternator, a<br>
power steering pump, an air pump, and the like.<br>
[0015] Powertrain 20 may also include an electric motor 32 that<br>
provides torque in accordance with a torque command 34. The torque of electric<br>
motor 32 can be combined with the torque of engine 22 to provide power for<br>
powertrain 20. While electric motor 32 is shown coupled in series with the torque<br>
output of engine 22, it should be appreciated that other configurations are alsc<br>
contemplated to be within the scope of this description. For example, electric<br>
motor 32 may be implemented as one or more electric motors that provide torque<br>
directly to wheels 36 instead of passing through a transmission 38.<br>
 <br>
[0016] The combined torque of engine 22 and electric motor 32 is<br>
applied to an input of transmission 38. Transmission 38 may be an automatic<br>
transmission that switches gears in accordance with a gear change command 40<br>
from PCM 26. An output shaft of transmission 38 is coupled to an input of a<br>
differential gear 42. Differential gear 42 drives axles and wheels 36. Wheel<br>
speed sensors 44 generate signals that indicate a rotation speed of their<br>
respective wheels 36.<br>
[0017] PCM 26 receives an accelerator pedal position signal from a<br>
pedal position sensor 46. PCM 26 also receives a set speed signal from a cruise<br>
or speed control interface module 48. An adaptive cruise control sensor 50<br>
senses vehicles or other obstacles that are in a driving path and generates a<br>
signal that indicates a distance to the obstacles. The signal can be used to<br>
adjust a set speed that is provided via speed control interface module 48.<br>
[0018] Referring now FIGs. 2A and 2B, a functional block diagram is<br>
shown of a coordinated torque control system 100. Coordinated torque control<br>
system 100 can be implemented with PCM 26. FIGs. 2A and 2B join together to<br>
depict the complete functional block diagram. A first connector label "A" on FIG.<br>
2A overlays a second connector label "A" on FIG. 2B. A first connector label "3"<br>
on FIG. 2A overlays a second connector label "B" on FIG. 2B. FIGs. 2A and 2B<br>
are collectively referred to as FIG. 2.<br>
[0019] Coordinated torque control system 100 employs a torque<br>
request backbone module 102 that determines a propulsion torque demand and<br>
communicates the propulsion torque demand to a propulsion torque control<br>
 <br>
module 104. Torque request backbone module 102 determines the propulsion<br>
torque demand based on inputs from a plurality of torque requesting modules<br>
that are described below in more detail. The torque requesting modules include<br>
modules that want to affect one or more of actuators 24 to affect the engine<br>
torque. The propulsion torque demand represents the torque needed from<br>
engine 22 in order to satisfy the needs of the torque requesting modules such<br>
that they can carry out their respective control strategies.<br>
[0020] Propulsion torque control module 104 controls one or more of<br>
actuators 24-1, ..., 24-M, i.e. actuators 24, based on the net propulsion torque<br>
demand. Actuators 24 affect the engine torque. Examples of actuators 24<br>
include an ignition module that delivers an ignition spark to the engine at a<br>
specified ignition timing, a fuel injection module that delivers a specified amount<br>
of fuel to the engine at a specified time, an electronic throttle control module that<br>
moves a throttle valve to a specified opening, and the like.<br>
[0021] Each torque requesting module is categorized as either an axle<br>
torque requesting module or a propulsion torque requesting module. Axle torque<br>
requesting modules control at least one of vehicle speed and vehicle traction with<br>
the road surface. Propulsion torque requesting modules control the output<br>
torque of the engine and electric motor 32. The axle torque requesting modules<br>
are shown in FIG. 2A and will now be described in more detail.<br>
[0022] A driver-side torque request module 200 generates a driver<br>
torque request based on various driver-side input signals 108, including, but no:<br>
limited to, cruise control input signals and a pedal position signal. The driver<br>
 <br>
torque request represents the axle torque needed to accelerate the vehicle in<br>
accordance with at least one of the driver-side input signals 108, engine speed<br>
signal 28, and vehicle speed signal 44.<br>
[0023] Other axle torque requesting modules are represented by axle<br>
torque request modules 300-1, ..., 300-J, referred to collectively as axle torque<br>
request modules 300. A first example of an axle torque request module 300 is a<br>
traction/drag control module. The traction/drag control module determines axle<br>
torque changes needed to control positive wheel slip and negative wheel slip.<br>
Positive wheel slip refers to slip between a vehicle tire and the road surface due<br>
to excessive powertrain torque during acceleration. Negative wheel slip refers to<br>
slip between the vehicle tire and the road surface due to excessive braking axle<br>
torque during deceleration. The slip can be detected based on the signals from<br>
wheel speed sensors 44.<br>
[0024] A second example of an axle torque request module 300 is a<br>
vehicle over-speed protection module. The vehicle over-speed protection<br>
module determines a maximum axle torque limit in order to keep the vehicle<br>
speed below a predetermined speed limit.<br>
[0025] A third example of an axle torque request module 300 is a brake<br>
torque management module. The brake torque management module determines<br>
a maximum axle torque when the vehicle brakes are applied. The maximum axle<br>
torque prevents the axle torque from overcoming the brake torque of the vehicle<br>
brakes.<br>
 <br>
[0026] A fourth example of an axle torque request module 300 is a<br>
stability control module. The stability control module generates axle torque<br>
requests based on a yaw rate of the vehicle. A stability control module may be<br>
included in an electronic stability control system, such as the StabiliTrak system<br>
sold by General Motors.<br>
[0027] Torque control backbone module 102 includes an axle torque<br>
arbitration module 302 that receives the various torque requests and/or limits<br>
from driver-side torque request module 200, axle torque request modules 300,<br>
and a torque cutoff control module 306 (shown in FIG. 2B). Torque cutoff control<br>
module 306 is described further below. Axle torque arbitration module 302<br>
generates a net axle torque request based on the torque requests and/or limits<br>
and communicates the net axle torque request to an axle-to-propulsion (i.e. axle<br>
torque to engine torque) torque conversion module 304. The axle-to-propulsion<br>
torque conversion module 304 converts the net axle torque request to a<br>
corresponding propulsion torque request based on at least one of the gear ratios<br>
in the axle differential gear 42, diameter of wheels 36, a gear ratio of<br>
transmission 38, and torque converter gain. The axle-to-propulsion torque<br>
conversion module 304 communicates the corresponding propulsion torque<br>
request to a propulsion torque arbitration module 308 that is included in torque<br>
control backbone 102.<br>
[0028] Discussion will now move to the various propulsion torque<br>
requesting modules which are shown in FIG. 2B. A stall prevention module 402<br>
determines a minimum torque needed to keep engine 22 running. Stall<br>
 <br>
prevention module 402 may increase the minimum torque based on input from at<br>
least one of an engine crank and stop module 404 and an engine capacity<br>
protection module 406. Engine crank and stop module 404 increases the<br>
minimum torque request based on whether the engine is a new or green engine.<br>
A green requires a greater fuel injection pulse width to purge air from the fuel<br>
system when the vehicle is first assembled. To compensate for the increased<br>
fuel injection pulse width, engine crank and stop module 404 may also<br>
communicate with propulsion torque control module 104 so that it may retard the<br>
ignition timing and maintain the engine torque constant despite the increased fuel<br>
injector pulse width. Engine capacity protection module 406 provides a<br>
maximum torque limit for engine 22 based on mechanical limitations of<br>
powertrain 20. Examples of limitations include maximum torque limit of<br>
transmission 38, a maximum temperature limit of catalyst 30, and the like.<br>
[0029] Propulsion torque arbitration module 308 also receives<br>
propulsion torque requests from one or more other propulsion torque request<br>
modules 500-1, ..., 500-K, referred to collectively as propulsion torque request<br>
modules 500. An example of a propulsion torque request module 500 includes a<br>
transmission torque request module that generates a torque request to reduce<br>
the engine torque during transmission shifts. Other propulsion torque request<br>
modules 500 can include at least one of an engine over-speed protection module<br>
and an engine idle speed control module. The engine over-speed protection<br>
module determines a propulsion torque limit to prevent the engine speed or RPM<br>
from exceeding a predetermined engine speed. The engine speed can be<br>
 <br>
determined based on the signal from crankshaft position sensor 28. The engine<br>
idle speed control module determines the propulsion torque needed to maintain<br>
engine 22 at a predetermined idle speed during coasting or at idle with<br>
transmission in 38 in drive or neutral.<br>
[0030] Propulsion torque arbitration module 308 also receives reserve<br>
torque requests from one or more reserve torque request modules 502-1,<br>
502-N, referred to collectively as reserve torque request modules 502. Reserve<br>
torque refers to torque that will be needed from engine 22 in the future. A first<br>
example of a reserve torque request module 502 is an air conditioning<br>
compressor torque compensation module. The air conditioning compressor<br>
torque compensation module requests a reserve torque so that the engine speed<br>
remains fairly constant when compressor clutch 31 engages and disengages.<br>
[0031] A second example of a reserve torque request module 502 is a<br>
catalyst light-off module. When the engine is started cold the catalyst light-off<br>
module requests that the engine spark be retarded to increase the exhaust gas<br>
temperature and thereby heat catalyst 30 to its conversion temperature. To<br>
compensate for the torque loss that is caused by the retarded spark the catalyst<br>
light-off module can also request that the throttle opening be increased while the<br>
spark is retarded.<br>
[0032] A third example of a reserve torque request module 502 is an<br>
intrusive diagnostic module. An intrusive diagnostic, such as an idle catalyst<br>
monitor, needs to change the air/fuel ratio of the engine to perform a diagnostic<br>
module. The intrusive diagnostic module therefore requests reserve torque to<br>
 <br>
compensate for the torque effect of a diagnostic procedure that is about to<br>
execute.<br>
[0033] In some situations the propulsion torque needs to be minimized<br>
by momentarily turning off fuel and/or spark to the engine. Torque cutoff module<br>
306 generates the torque requests for these situations, which can include at least<br>
one of a clutch fuel cutoff and a deceleration fuel cutoff. A clutch fuel cutoff<br>
occurs when the vehicle is equipped with a manual transmission and the vehicle<br>
operator disengages the clutch. The clutch fuel cutoff prevents the engine speed<br>
from flaring beyond a predetermined speed when the clutch disengages and<br>
removes a load from the engine. The deceleration fuel cutoff occurs when the<br>
vehicle is coasting above a predetermined speed. The deceleration fuel cutoff<br>
helps increase engine braking. Deceleration fuel cutoffs are also communicated<br>
to axle torque arbitration module 302.<br>
[0034] Propulsion torque arbitration module 308 generates a total<br>
requested propulsion torque based on the torque requests and/or limits from the<br>
various propulsion torque request modules and the axle torque arbitration<br>
module. Propulsion torque arbitration module 308 communicates the total<br>
requested propulsion torque to propulsion torque control module 104.<br>
[0035] Torque control backbone 102 may also be configured to use<br>
with a hybrid electric vehicle. A hybrid electric vehicle includes engine 22 and<br>
electric motor 32, which cooperate to propel the vehicle. In a hybrid electric<br>
vehicle, the total axle torque request from axle torque arbitration module 302 is<br>
communicated to a hybrid control module 700. Hybrid control module 700<br>
 <br>
determines how much propulsion torque will be provided by electric motor 32 and<br>
how much will be provided by engine 22. Hybrid control module 700<br>
communicates the engine's share of the propulsion torque to propulsion torque<br>
arbitration module 308. The electric motor's share of the propulsion torque is<br>
communicated to electric motor 32 via torque command 34. Axle to propulsion<br>
torque conversion module 304 may be combined with hybrid control module 700.<br>
Also, torque cutoff module 306 may communicate deceleration fuel cutoff torque<br>
requests to hybrid control module 700 instead of axle torque arbitration module<br>
302.<br>
[0036] As described above with respect to FIGS. 2A and 2B, torque<br>
requests from certain modules within an engine control system may be mapped<br>
to an axle torque request, which is then converted to an engine torque request<br>
based on various transmission and axle ratios. In some implementations,<br>
transmission gear ratio information may not be secured. As such, a given axle<br>
torque request may be converted into a corresponding engine torque request that<br>
is too large for a current gear ratio. For example, a driver axle torque request of<br>
500 Nm corresponds to an engine torque request of 50 Nm in a gear ratio of 13<br>
(e.g. 1st gear). If the gear ratio is changed to 1, the resulting engine torque<br>
request would be 500 Nm.<br>
[0037] Accordingly, certain driver-side torque requests may be<br>
implemented (e.g. mapped) as engine torque requests. After the initial request is<br>
generated as an engine torque request, the engine torque request is converted to<br>
an axle torque request based on a desired ratio conversion. The axle torque<br>
 <br>
arbitration module 302 receives the resulting axle torque request, and the axle<br>
torque request is converted back to an engine torque request according to the<br>
same desired ratio conversion.<br>
[0038] Referring now to FIG. 3, the driver-side torque request module<br>
200 is shown in more detail, a pedal position signal 800 represents a vehicle<br>
acceleration requested by the vehicle operator. Pedal position signal 800 may<br>
be generated by the pedal position sensor 46.<br>
[0039] A cruise control torque request module 802 generates a cruise<br>
control torque request based on various inputs including, but not limited to, cruise<br>
control switch and brake inputs. The cruise control torque request represents an<br>
axle torque that is needed to maintain the vehicle at the set speed indicated via<br>
the interface module 48. An adaptive cruise control torque request module 804<br>
may communicate with cruise control torque request module 802 to modify the<br>
cruise control torque request based on the environment surrounding the vehicle.<br>
For example, adaptive cruise control torque request module 804 may request<br>
that the axle torque be reduced so that the vehicle decelerates and/or maintains<br>
at least a minimum following distance behind a second vehicle while the cruise<br>
control is active. An actual following distance can be indicated by the signal from<br>
adaptive cruise control sensor 50.<br>
[0040] A pedal-to-engine torque request module 806 receives the<br>
pedal position signal 800 and generates a pedal engine torque request signal<br>
accordingly. For example, the pedal-to-engine torque request module 806 may<br>
map a pedal position to a corresponding engine torque request. An engine-to-<br>
 <br>
axle torque conversion module 808 receives the pedal engine torque request<br>
signal and converts the pedal engine torque request to a pedal axle torque<br>
request. For example, the engine-to-axle torque conversion module 806 may<br>
store transmission and axle ratios.<br>
[0041] A final driver axle torque request module 810 receives the pedal<br>
axle torque request and the cruise control torque request and generates a final<br>
driver-side axle torque request accordingly. As described above with respect to<br>
FIGS. 2A and 2B, the axle torque arbitration module 302 generates a net axle<br>
torque request based on the torque requests and/or limits and communicates the<br>
net axle torque request to the axle-to-propulsion (i.e. axle torque to engine<br>
torque) torque conversion module 304.<br>
[0042] In certain situations, the cruise control torque request may be<br>
larger than the pedal torque request. A rate limit module 812 may limit the final<br>
engine torque request according to the pedal engine torque request and output a<br>
final torque request accordingly. For example, the rate limit module 812 may<br>
limit the final engine torque request bested on a torque change that corresponds<br>
to the pedal engine torque request. Ultimately, an amount of change of the final<br>
engine torque request output from the rate limit module 812 may be limited to an<br>
amount of change corresponding to the pedal engine torque request. As such,<br>
even if the cruise control torque request is larger than the pedal engine torque<br>
request, the rate limit module 812 may limit the resulting change in the requested<br>
torque to that requested by the pedal position signal 800.<br>
 <br>
[0043] The rate limit module 812 may further include a torque security<br>
rate limit offset. For example, the torque security rate limit offset may include,<br>
but is not limited to, a calibrated value and/or a dynamically calculated value<br>
based on other conditions such as gear, vehicle speed, and engine speed. The<br>
torque security rate limit offset may add to or subtract from the amount of change<br>
corresponding to the pedal engine torque request. In other words, the rate limit<br>
module 812 may further adjust any rate limit according to both the amount of<br>
change corresponding to the pedal engine torque request and the torque security<br>
rate limit offset.<br>
[0044] Consequently, any rate limit enforced by the rate limit module<br>
812 increases and decreases according to the pedal engine torque request. As<br>
such, the rate limit module 812 does not limit driver initiated pedal engine torque<br>
requests themselves, and instead only limits torque requests above the pedal<br>
engine torque request. For example, in a situation where the driver is not<br>
actuating the accelerator pedal and the pedal engine torque request is constant,<br>
any torque requests from the cruise control torque request module 802 may be<br>
limited at the rate limit module 812.<br>
[0045] Further, the rate limit module 812 may selectively not limit the<br>
final engine torque request to the pedal engine torque request when the axie<br>
torque arbitration module 302 selects a requestor other than the driver-side<br>
torque request module 200. For example, the rate limit module 812 may not limit<br>
the final engine torque request when the axle torque arbitration module 302<br>
selects one of the axle torque request modules 300.<br>
 <br>
[0046] Referring now to FIG. 4, a method 900 for determining a rate<br>
limited axle torque request begins in step 902. In step 904, the method 900<br>
selects one of a plurality of axle torque requests. In step 906, the method 900<br>
converts the axle torque request to an engine torque request. In step 908, the<br>
method 900 determines whether the selected one of the plurality of axle torque<br>
requests corresponds to a driver-side torque request. If true, the method 900<br>
continues to step 910. If false, the method 900 continues to step 912.<br>
[0047] In step 910, the method 900 adjusts the engine torque request<br>
according to at least one of the pedal engine torque request and a torque<br>
security rate limit offset. In step 912, the method 900 outputs the final engine<br>
torque request.<br>
[0048] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the foregoing<br>
description that the broad teachings of the disclosure can be implemented in a<br>
variety of forms. Therefore, while this disclosure includes particular examples,<br>
the true scope of the disclosure should not be so limited since other modifications<br>
will become apparent to the skilled practitioner upon a study of the drawings, the<br>
specification, and the following claims.<br>
