METHODS, SYSTEMS, AND COMPUTER PROGRAM PRODUCTS FOR<br>
PROVIDING INTERNET PROTOCOL MULTIMEDIA SUBSYSTEM (IMS)<br>
REGISTRATION SERVICES FOR NON-IMS DEVICES<br>
RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/791,697, filed April 13, 2006; the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
This application is related to a commonly-assigned, co-pending U.S. Patent Application entitled Methods, Systems, and Computer Program Products for Providing Internet Protocol Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) Services in Response to Advanced Intelligent Network (AIN) Triggers, filed on even date herewith, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD The subject matter described herein relates to telephone subscriber equipment registration. More particularly, the subject matter described herein relates to methods, systems, and computer program products for providing Internet protocol multimedia subsystem (IMS) registration services for non-IMS devices.<br>
BACKGROUND IP multimedia subsystem (IMS) networks allow IMS-compatible devices to establish voice calls and to receive call originating and call terminating services using IMS network elements. In an IMS network, an IMS-compatible subscriber device, such as an IMS-compatible handset, is homed to a serving call session control function (S-CSCF). When an IMS-compatible device connects to a network anywhere, the IMS-compatible device first obtains an IP address. The IP address may be obtained by static assignment or by a dynamic protocol, such as DHCP. The IMS device then registers with the home S-CSCF.    Registration involves communicating the IMS device or<br><br>
subscriber identity and the corresponding IP address to the S-CSCF. For example, IMS devices may be identified by SIP URIs. An example of an IMS device identity that may be associated with an IMS subscriber's SIP phone is <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="c88ca9a6889cada3ada4adabe6aba7a5">[email&#160;protected]</a>. The SIP phone may obtain an IP address of 196.10.10.1 when the phone connects to the network. Registration of the SIP phone involves communicating the association between 196.10.10.1 and <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="165277785642737d737a73753875797b">[email&#160;protected]</a> to the subscriber's S-CSCF. Registration of IMS devices can be accomplished through SIP messaging between the devices and their respective S-CSCFs.<br>
Once an IMS device is registered with its S-CSCF, the device can originate and terminate calls and receive call originating and call terminating services using IMS network elements. For example, when the IMS device originates a call, the S-CSCF is notified of the call origination and queries a database, referred to as a home subscriber server (HSS) database, to determining call originating services to be applied to the call. Examples of call originating services include prepaid calling services and number portability services. The S-CSCF may then obtain routing information and invite the terminating device to the join the call. If the IMS device is at the terminating leg of the call, the S-CSCF receives an invitation for the device to join the call, determines the terminating services to apply to the call, and signals with the originating S-CSCF to establish the call.<br>
It may be desirable to establish calls and to provide services using IMS nodes to non-IMS devices, such as 2G mobile phones and PSTN phones or black phones. 2G mobile phones and black phones are incapable of receiving calls or services using IMS network elements because such devices are not identifiable to the IMS network. For example, black phones and 2G mobile phones are incapable of registering with the IMS network because they do not have registration signaling capabilities. As a result, such devices can receive calls and services only by relying on PSTN network elements. Consequently, such devices may be limited in the types of service that they can receive and may be charged more for such services than the corresponding services available via the IMS network.<br><br>
Accordingly, in light of these difficulties, there exists a need for methods, systems, and computer program products for providing Internet protocol multimedia subsystem (IMS) registration services for non-IMS devices.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
The subject matter described herein includes methods, systems, and computer program products for providing IMS registration service to non-IMS devices. One method includes identifying activity involving a non-IMS device. In response to identifying the activity involving non-IMS device, an IMS network registration operation is performed on behalf of the non-IMS device.<br>
The subject matter described herein for providing IMS registration service to non-IMS devices can be implemented using a computer program product comprising computer executable instructions embodied in a computer-readable medium. Exemplary computer-readable media suitable for implementing the subject matter described herein include chip memory devices, disk memory devices, programmable logic devices, application specific integrated circuits, and downloadable electrical signals. In addition, a computer-readable medium that implements the subject matter described herein may be implemented on a single device or computing platform or may be distributed across multiple physical devices and/or computing platforms.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
In light of the problems associated with providing calls and services to non-IMS devices using IMS network elements, the subject matter described herein includes methods, systems, and computer program products for providing IMS registration services for non-IMS devices. Figure 1 illustrates an exemplary system 100 for providing IMS registration services for non-IMS devices according to an embodiment of the subject matter described herein. In Figure 1, serving call session control functions (S-CSCF-1) 102 and S-CSCF-2 104 are shown interconnected via an IMS network 106. S-CSCF-1 102 and S-CSCF-2 104 provide access points for subscriber devices seeking to communicate using IMS network 106. An IMS-compatible SIP device 108 is shown connected to S-CSCF-1 102. SIP device 108 may be any 3G or higher generation device, such as a 30 cell phone or a personal digital assistant (PDA). SIP device 108 may generate and respond to SIP signaling messages for call setup and teardown. SIP device 108 is assumed to be IMS compatible and thus capable of registering with IMS network 106 through its associated S-CSCF-1 102.<br>
A Softswitch 110 is shown interconnecting S-CSCF-2 104 to an end office 122 and a mobile switching center (MSC) 123. Softswitch 110 may convert signaling between a signaling system 7 (SS7) signaling interface with end office 122 and MSC 123 and a SIP signaling Interface with S-CSCF-2104. Softswitch 110 may include or control media gateways (not shown) to send media stream communications between end subscribers that communicate using system 100.<br>
As stated above, it may be desirable to establish calls and provide other services to non-IMS devices using IMS network elements. Examples of non-<br><br>
IMS devices shown in Figure 1 are PSTN phones 116 and 118 and 2G mobile phone 120. These devices have conventionally been incapable of registering with the IMS network. In order to register non-IMS devices 116,118, and 120 with IMS network 106, an IMS proxy 200 may be provided. IMS proxy 200 may have an IP address that can be used as an identity for non-IMS devices 116, 118, and 120 with the IMS network. In addition, IMS proxy 200 may perform registration on behalf of non-IMS devices 116,118, or 120. It may be desirable to register a non-IMS device 116, 118, and 120 with the IMS network if the subscriber has subscribed with his or her service provider to receive IMS services and to maintain that registration for a finite time period during which the device may seek to access the IMS services. In the IMS world, IMS compatible devices may be registered when they are turned on or when they enter a service area. In the PSTN world, registration may be triggered by predetermined activity involving a non-IMS device. Three examples of activity that may be used to trigger IMS registration include change in presence status of a non-IMS device, detection of PSTN signaling messages involving a non-IMS device, or detection of predetermined subscriber action to register a non-IMS device. Examples of how each of these activities can be used to trigger IMS registration of a non-IMS device will be described in detail below. An IMS registration may be maintained for a finite time period after the activity that triggered the registration or until deregistration is expressly triggered.<br>
In one example, IMS proxy 200 may receive updates from presence server 201 regarding the status of non-IMS devices 116,118, and 120 in order to identify activity regarding non-IMS devices 116,118, and 120 and trigger IMS registration for the devices. Figure 2A illustrates such an embodiment. In Figure 2A, IMS proxy 200 has an IP address of 192.100.10.10. IMS proxy 200 receives an update message from presence server concerning PSTN telephone number 9194605500 associated with non-IMS device 116. In the example illustrated in Figure 2A, it is assumed that IMS proxy 200 subscribes to the telephone number 9194605500 with presence server 201 to receive updates whenever the status of device 116 changes. For example, when a subscriber associated with device 116 initiates a call, a change in presence status and a corresponding update message may be generated.    In an<br><br>
alternate embodiment, IMS proxy 200 may query presence server 201 for status updates regarding each non-IMS device 116,118, and 120. IMS proxy 200 may be provisioned with the identities of devices 116,118, and 120 at the time the subscribers subscribe to receive IMS service with their telephone service provider.<br>
In response to receiving the update message, IMS proxy 200 may generate a corresponding registration message. The registration message may correlate the telephone number, 9194605500 to the IP address of IMS proxy 200. The registration message may be sent to S-CSCF 104 and the corresponding registration information may be stored in a registration database 202. In the illustrated example, registration database 202 includes a table structure 204. Table 204 includes a first column 206 that associates SIP to/from identifiers with corresponding IP addresses in column 208. In the illustrated example, row 210 associates the PSTN identifier 9194605500 with IP address 192.100.10.10, which corresponds to IMS proxy 200. The second row in table 204 associates the PSTN identifiers of non-IMS device 118 with the IP address of proxy 200. The third row 214 indicates that PSTN device is provisioned with S-CSCF 104 but is not registered. The final row in table 204 contains a mapping between a URL associated with an IMS subscriber and the corresponding IP address of the subscriber's device.<br>
In the example illustrated in Figure 2A, activity involving non-IMS devices is identified and IMS registration is triggered based on presence status update messages concerning non-IMS devices. In an alternate example, activity involving non-IMS devices 116, 118 and 120 may be identified and IMS registration may be triggered through monitoring SS7 signaling messages involving non-IMS devices. Figure 2B illustrates such an embodiment. In Figure 2B, IMS proxy 200 may include an interface with end office 122 and/or signaling link probes 220 and 222 that monitor signaling links that connect end office 122 and MSC 123 to Softswitch 110. The signaling links monitored may be SS7 over TDM links or SS7 over IP links. Accordingly, the signaling messages that are monitored may be SS7 messages over MTP transport or SS7 messages over IP transport, including SS7 over SIGTRAN over IP transport.<br><br>
In the illustrated example, when non-IMS phone 116 initiates a call, end office 122 generates an ISUP lAM message. The ISUP lAM message may be used to trigger IMS registration of device 116 so that IMS services may be provided to device 116. In another example, when a PSTN phone, such as device 116 initiates a call, a TCAP message may be generated. The TCAP message may be used to trigger IMS registration of a non-IMS device. In yet another example, a mobile phone, such as 2G handset 120, may register with the network. In response to the registration, MSC123 may generate a location update or registration notification message, depending on the network protocol being used. The location update or registration notification message may be used to trigger IMS registration of a non-IMS mobile device, such as device 120. In response to detecting the signaling messages, IMS proxy may generate a corresponding registration message and send the registration message to S-CSCF 104. S-CSCF 104 may be update registration database 202 to associate the PSTN identifier of the non-IMS device with the IP address of IMS proxy 200.<br>
In yet another alternate example, the action that triggers registration of a non-IMS device may be predetermined subscriber action, such as the dialing of predetermined registration digits that trigger an IMS registration. Figure 2C illustrates such an embodiment. In Figure 2C, the subscriber at non-IMS device 116 may dial predetermined digits, such as *99 that are recognized by end office 122 as a trigger for IMS registration. In response to receiving the *99 digits, end office may send a message, such as a TCAP message with a payload indicating an IMS registration, to IMS proxy 200. IMS proxy 200 may generate a corresponding registration message that registers the non-IMS device with S-CSCF 104.<br>
Once a registration action occurs, it may be desirable to terminate a registration after a predetermined time period. For example, if no further activity has been detected from an IMS device within an operator configurable time period after an initial registration, an entry may be removed from registration database 202. Such a timeout-based deregistration mechanism may be implemented using a deregistration timer at S-CSCF 104. Each entry may have an associated timestamp. If the timestamp of an entry is older than<br><br>
a predetermined amount, an entry may be removed. The timestamp of an entry may be updated each time new activity that would trigger an IMS registration is detected.<br>
Figures 3A and 3B illustrate the use of system 100 to connect a voice call between SIP device 108 and non-IMS phone 116 using the registration information generated and stored within registration database 202. In the message flow example illustrated in Figure 3A, a SIP INVITE message is received by S-CSCF-2 104. The SIP INVITE message includes the non-IMS called party number in the destination "To:" field and the source email address in the source "From:" field.<br>
Upon receipt of the SIP INVITE message, S-CSCF-2 104 may modify and forward the SIP INVITE message. By use of the information within routing table 204, the SIP INVITE message may be modified by addition of an IP address associated with 2G IMS proxy 200 within an "IP Dest. Add:" field. By performing a lookup within routing table 204 using the called party number which may be found within SIP To/From field 206 of row 210, S-CSCF-2 104 may identify the IP address of 2G IMS proxy 200 within IP destination address field 208 and may add it to the SIP INVITE message. In the message flow example illustrated within Figure 3A, the SIP INVITE message as modified may be fon/varded to Softswitch 110.<br>
Figure 3B illustrates the receipt of the modified SIP INVITE message by 2G IMS proxy 200 within Softswitch 110. Upon receipt of the modified SIP INVITE message, 2G IMS proxy 200 may originate and forward an SS7 initial address message (lAM) to end office 112. The 1AM message may include the called party number of non-IMS subscriber 116 as the destination of the lAM message. End office 112 terminates the lAM message and rings non-IMS phone 116. End office 112 formulates and forwards an address complete message (ACM) to Softswitch 110 to indicate that a trunk has been resen/ed for the voice call and to indicate that non-IMS phone 116 is ringing. Softswitch 110 originates and fonwards a SIP 180 RINGING message to S-CSCF-2 104.<br>
Returning to Figure 3A, S-CSCF-2104 forwards the SIP 180 RINGING message toward SIP device 108. Message forwarding may continue in this fashion until the SIP 180 RINGING message is received by SIP device 108.<br><br>
Call setup continues with a SIP 200 OK message (not shown) originating from end office 112 when non-IMS phone 116 is answered. At that point, voice communication may proceed and call setup may be completed.<br>
Accordingly, IMS capable devices may use SIP signaling within network system 100 to initiate voice calls with non-IMS devices that are registered using the IMS registration services described above. Because non-IMS phones are registered with the IMS network, IMS calls and other services can be provided to such devices.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates an exemplary process for registering non-IMS phones with an IMS network. In step 400, activity involving a non-IMS subscriber terminal is identified. Examples of activity that may be identified are described above with respect to Figures 2A-2C.<br>
In step 402, the process may, in response to identifying the activity involving non-IMS subscriber terminal, perform an IMS network registration operation on behalf of the non-IMS subscriber terminal. Registration may be affected using IMS proxy 200 as illustrated in Figures 2A-2C.<br>
Figure 5 illustrates an exemplary process for registering a non-IMS phone with an IMS network by having a Softswitch query a presence server for registration information for the non-IMS phone and for establishing a call with the non-IMS phone. Referring to Figure 5, in step 500, a presence server receives new presence information for a non-IMS phone. For example, the new presence information may be an indication that the non-IMS phone is initiating a new call.<br>
In step 502, the presence server is queried for status information for the non-IMS phone. For example, IMS proxy 200 may query presence server 201 for the status of IMS phone 116. Alternatively, IMS proxy 200 may subscribe to a non-IMS phone with the presence server so that proxy 200 will be notified when presence information changes for a non-IMS phone. At decision point 504, IMS proxy 200 waits for an update message to be received from presence server 201. As described above, the update message may be in response to eithera query or a subscription to IMS phone llSwith presence server 201. In step 506, once IMS proxy receives the update message, IMS proxy 200 sends<br><br>
registration information to an S-CSCF, such as S-CSCF-2 104, to register the non-IMS phone within an IMS network.<br>
Once registered with the IMS network, call setup SIP signaling messages may be processed on behalf of the non-IMS phone. Such messages may be processed by Softswitch 110 using registration information received from S-CSCF 104. At decision point 508, the process may wait to determine whether a SIP INVITE message has been received for the non-IMS phone. When a determination is made that a SIP INVITE message has been received for the non-IMS phone, the process may generate an SS7 lAM message and fonvard the lAM message to an end office, such as end office 122, to initiate a voice call to the non-IMS phone at step 510.<br>
At decision point 512, the process may wait for an SS7 ACM message to be received from end office 122. Upon receipt of an ACM message, the process may generate a provisional SIP 180 RINGING message and forward the message to S-CSCF-2 104 as a response to the SIP INVITE message at block 514. At decision point 516, the process may wait for an SS7 ANM message to be received. Upon receipt of an ANM message, the process may generate a success SIP 200 OK message and forward the message to S-CSCF-2 104 as a success response to the SIP INVITE message at block 518 and a voice call may be established with the non-IMS phone via a voice trunk.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates an exemplary process for registering a non-IMS by monitoring SS7 signaling messages associated with the non-IMS phone and for completing a call with the non-IMS phone. In steps 600 and 602, the process may monitor SS7 signaling messages to identify activity involving a non-IMS device that is provisioned to receive IMS services. For example, IMS proxy 200 may monitor SS7 signaling messages until ISUP, TCAP, MAP, IMAP, or other messages involving a non-IMS phone that is provisioned to receive IMS service are detected. In response to detecting such messages, control proceeds to step 604 where proxy 200 sends a registration message to the S-CSCF to register the non-IMS phone.<br>
Once registered with the IMS network, call setup SIP signaling messages may be processed on behalf of the non-IMS phone. The call setup signaling messages may be processed by Softswitch 110 using registration<br><br>
information obtained from S-CSCF 104. At decision point 606, the process may wait to determine whether a SIP INVITE message has been received for the non-IMS phone. When a determination is made that a SIP INVITE message has been received for the non-IMS phone, the process may generate an SS7 lAM message and forward the lAM message to an end office, such as end office 122, to initiate a voice call to the non-IMS phone at block 608.<br>
At decision point 610, the process may wait for an SS7ACM message to be received from end office 122. Upon receipt of an ACM message, the process may generate a provisional SIP 180 RINGING message and fonward the message to S-CSCF-2 104 as a response to the SIP INVITE message at block 612. At decision point 614, the process may wait for an SS7 ANM message to be received. Upon receipt of an ANM message, the process may generate a success SIP 200 OK message and forward the message to S-CSCF-2 104 as a success response to the SIP INVITE message at block 616 and a voice call may be established with the non-IMS phone via a voice trunk.<br>
Figure 7 is a flow chart illustrating an exemplary process for registering a non-IMS subscriber terminal with an IMS network in response to subscriber action according to an embodiment of the subject matter described herein. Referring to Figure 7, in step 700, DTMF digits are received from a non-IMS subscriber terminal. The DTMF digits may be predetermined digits that are associated with an IMS registration request. The DTMF digits may be received by end office 122. In step 702, in response to the DTMF digits, end office 122 may communicate a registration request to IMS proxy 200. The registration request may be a TCAP message with a payload indicating that an IMS registration is requested. In step 704, in response to the IMS registration request, a registration message is sent from IMS proxy 200 to S-CSCF 104. In block 706, S-CSCF 104 associates the non-IMS subscriber terminal identifier with the IMS proxy identifier in its registration database. The non-IMS subscriber terminal may be the PSTN directory number of the subscriber terminal. For mobile phones, the non-IMS subscriber terminal may be the IMSI or MSISDN number associated with the terminal. The IMS proxy identifier may be an IP address associated with the IMS proxy.<br><br>
In the examples described above, it is assumed that the non-IMS subscriber terminal is provisioned to receive IMS services. In an alternate example, a subscriber may subscribe to receive IMS services from any non-IMS terminal that the subscriber desires to use to communicate. For example, a subscriber may wish to use IMS services from a black phone in a hotel. In order to use the services, the black phone in the hotel must be registered with the IMS network. In order to register the black phone, the subscriber may initiate an IMS registration using a process similar to that illustrated in Figure 7 where the subscriber communicates predetermined DTMF digits to initiate an IMS registration, in addition to the registration initiating digits, the subscriber may also communicate a subscriber identifier to the IMS network. The subscriber identifier may be an identifier that the IMS network recognizes as an identifier that is provisioned to receive IMS services. The subscriber identifier along with the directory number of the hotel black phone may be registered with the IP address of the IMS proxy in a serving call session control function, as described above.<br>
AIN to IMS Trigger Mapping As described above, an additional problem with connecting non-IMS devices to an IMS network is providing a mechanism for mapping AIN triggers to registered non-IMS devices to IMS triggers, so that the IMS network can provide AIN-like services to the registered devices. Figure 8 is a network diagram illustrating an exemplary system for providing AIN to IMS trigger mapping according to an embodiment of the subject matter described herein. Referring to Figure 8, Softswitch 110 includes a 2G-AIN intenworking function 800 that maps PSTN triggers, such as call origination attempt triggers to AIN triggers. Softswitch 110 may also include 2G/IMS proxy 200, although proxy 200 is not illustrated in Figure 8 for simplicity. The IMS network may include one or more platforms 802, 804, and 806 that provide AIN-like services to IMS registered devices. In the illustrated example, platform 802 comprises a prepaid platform for providing prepaid calling services to IMS-registered devices. The IMS network may also include a home subscriber server (HSS) 808 that stores profiles for IMS-registered devices.  The IMS network may<br><br>
further include S-CSCF 104, which includes registration database 202 described above.<br>
In operation, when an IMS-registered device, such as black phone 116 goes off hook, a TCAP call origination attempt trigger message is generated by end office 112. AIN/IMS inter-working function 800 receives the TCAP message. In an alternate example, the trigger message may be a MAP message, an I NAP message, or a CAMEL-based message. AIN/IMS inter-working function 800 may translate, map, or encapsulate the AIN trigger and associated information, such as the subscriber identifier, into a form that may be communicated using a SIP message, such as a SIP invite, info, message, or other SIP message. In the illustrated example, a SIP invite message is used to communicate the call origination attempt trigger to the IMS network.<br>
The resulting trigger carrying SIP message is fon/varded to S-CSCF 104 that is associated with the 2G subscriber. The 2G subscriber is assumed to have been previously registered by IMS proxy 200 described above. In one implementation, S-CSCF 104 uses the 2G subscriber information in the SIP trigger message to query HSS 808. HSS 808 stores information associated with origination and termination attempt that is to be performed for the 2G subscriber. S-CSCF 104 receives information associated with the specified origination or termination attempt processing application and invokes the specified service on behalf of the 2G subscriber.<br>
Figure 9 illustrates in more detail the database stored by HSS 808. In Figure 9, HSS 808 includes a database 900 that stores information that indicates the type of trigger to be performed for a particular subscriber. In this example, database 900 indicates that the subscriber corresponding to 9194605500 receives application one (APP1) origination service. HSS 808 communicates this information to S-CSCF 104. S-CSCF 104 then queries platform 802 for the appropriate information. In the illustrated example, platform 802 is a prepaid application. The prepaid application may determine whether device 116 has sufficient prepaid credit to originate a call.<br>
Returning to Figure 8, once the subscriber is determined to have sufficient credit, S-CSCF 104 may generate a SIP message including the prepaid result.   AIN/IMS inter-working function 800 may receive the SIP<br><br>
message and translate, map, or decapsulate payload information in the SIP message and generate a corresponding response to the originally received 2G AIN trigger message. In the illustrated example, the response is a TCAP response message indicating the prepaid result. The response message may be communicated to end office 112.<br>
Figure 10 is a flow chart illustrating an exefnplary process for providing an IMS service in response to an AIN trigger according to an embodiment of the subject matter described herein. Referring to Figure 10, in step 1000, the firing of an AIN trigger concerning an IMS registered non-IMS device is detected. For example, referring to Figure 8, AIN/IMS inter-working function 18 may detect a call originating attempt trigger corresponding to a call originated by device 116.<br>
Returning to Figure 10, in step 1002, an IMS service to be provided in response to the AIN trigger is identified. Returning to Figure 8, inter-working function 800 communicates the firing of the call origination attempt trigger to the S-CSCF 104. S-CSCF104 queries HSS 808 to determine the type of IMS service to be provided. HSS 808 may determine whether an originating or terminating attempt trigger is to be applied based on the leg of the call for which the trigger was generated and may select the appropriate service to be applied for the subscriber and the trigger type. In Figure 9, the IMS service to be provided is identified as APP1 service or prepaid service.<br>
Returning to Figure 10, in step 1004, the IMS service is provided. Returning to Figure 8, in order to provide the IMS service, S-CSCF 104 queries prepaid platform 802 and receives a response indicating whether or not the call can be completed. S-CSCF 104 assumes a prepaid result message to inter-working function 800, which generates a corresponding TCAP message indicating the prepaid result and communicates the TCAP message to end office 122.<br>
The subject matter described herein is not limited to providing IMS services in response to call originating attempt triggers. For example, IMS services may also be provided in response to call terminating triggers. Examples of services that may be provided in response to call terminating trigger include call screening services.<br><br>
