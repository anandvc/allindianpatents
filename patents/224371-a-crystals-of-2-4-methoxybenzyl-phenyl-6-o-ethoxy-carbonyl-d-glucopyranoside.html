BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Crystalline forms a and |5 of the present invention can be prepared as follows.<br>
Crystals of 2-(4-methoxybenzyl)phenyl 6-O-ethoxy-<br>
carbonyl-(3-D-glucopyranoside were firstly obtained by dissolving an amorphous form of said compound in ethanol under heating, and then scratching a wall of a vessel for crystallization under ice-cooling. The crystals were obtained<br>
in a mixture of crystalline forms a and (3. The present inventors had eagerly studied for crystallizing conditions and found that crystalline forms a and (3 of the present invention could be prepared in a pure crystalline form by crystallizing from a particular solvent as described below.<br>
Crystalline form a of the present invention can be prepared as follows. An arbitrary form of 2-(4-methoxybenzyl)phenyl<br>
6-O-ethoxycarbonyl-|3-D-glucopyranoside is dissolved in a suitable first solvent (also referred to as "good solvent" ) under heating. Thereafter, to the solution is added, if required, a second solvent (also referred to as "poor solvent"), and the resulting mixture is stirred or stood for crystallization. The precipitated crystals are collected and dried to afford crystalline form a . Examples of first solvents include ethanol, isopropanol, ethyl acetate, acetone or methyl ethyl ketone, which can be used singly or as a mixture of one or more solvents. The amount of first solvents is varied depending on the type of the<br>
solvent, and is ordinarily in the range of about 2 to about 20 parts by weight on the basis of a part by weight of<br>
2	- (4 -methoxybenzyl) phenyl 6 -0-ethoxycarbonyl-(3-D-gluco-<br>
pyranoside. Examples of second solvents, which can be miscible<br>
with a solution of said compound in a first solvent, include<br>
hexane, heptane or water. The amount of second solvents is varied<br>
depending on the type of the solvent, and is ordinarily in the<br>
range of about 0.1 to about 5 parts by weight on the basis of<br>
a part by weight of a first solvent. The crystallizing temperature<br>
for crystalline form a is ordinarily below about 50° C, preferably<br>
in the range of about 20 to about 50° C. The crystallizing time<br>
is varied depending on the crystallizing temperature, and is<br>
ordinarily in the range of about 1 to about 24 hours.<br>
Crystalline form |3 of the present invention can be prepared as follows. An arbitrary form of 2-(4-methoxybenzyl)phenyl<br>
6-O-ethoxycarbonyl-|3-D-glucopyranoside  is  dissolved  in methanol, the amount of which is ordinarily in the range of about<br>
3	to about 10 parts by weight, preferably about 4 to about 6<br>
parts by weight on the basis of a part by weight of<br>
2- ( 4-methoxybenzyl)phenyl 6-O-ethoxycarbonyl-|3-D-gluco-<br>
pyranoside. Thereafter, the solution is concentrated under<br>
reduced pressure at a temperature of about 30 to about 40° C for<br>
crystallization, and the precipitated crystals are collected<br>
and dried to afford crystalline form (3. Alternatively,<br>
crystalline form |3 can be prepared by heating an amorphous form<br>
of 2-(4-methoxybenzyl)phenyl 6-0-ethoxycarbonyl-p-D-gluco-<br>
pyranoside at a temperature of about 120 to about 140° C for about<br>
1 to about 4 hours.<br>
Crystalline forms a and (3 thus obtained can be identified by their characteristic diffraction peaks as shown in the X-ray powder diffraction charts of fig. 1 or 2;<br>
(1)	crystalline form a has characteristic peaks at a<br>
diffraction angle (20± 0.1) of 5.6, 13.8, 14.6, 16.8, 17.7 and<br>
20.8 degrees as illustrated in fig. 1;<br>
(2)	crystalline form |3 has characteristic peaks at a<br>
diffraction angle (20 ± 0.1) of 4.7, 5.5, 7.3, 8.6, 14.5 and<br>
16.7 degrees as illustrated in fig. 2.<br>
Crystalline forms a and p of the present invention can be stored under ordinarily storage conditions such as 25 ° C/60% relative humidity and the like for a long period without changing their crystalline forms, and are also chemically stable.<br>
Crystalline forms a and |3 of the present invention have excellent f lowabilities and goodhandling properties, and can be formulated into powders, fine granules, granules, tablets, capsules or the like according to conventional methods.<br>
In the case of using a pharmaceutical composition comprising a crystal of the present invention as an active ingredient, various dosage forms can be administered depending upon their usages. Exemplary dosage forms include powders, granules, fine granules, dry syrups, tablets, capsules, injections, liquids, ointments, suppositories, poultices and the like, which are administered orally or parenterally.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions can be formulated by admixing, diluting  or dissolving with appropriate pharmaceutical<br>
additives such as excipients, disintegrators, binders, lubricants, diluents, buffers, isotonic agents, preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents, dispersing agents, stabilizing agents, solubilizing agents and the like, according to conventional formulation procedures depending upon their dosage forms.<br>
In the case of using a pharmaceutical composition for a medical treatment, the dosage of a crystal of the present invention as an active ingredient is appropriately determined depending on the age, sexor body weight of the individual patient, the severity of the disease, the condition to be treated and the like. A typical dosage for oral administration is in the range of from about 0.1 mg to about 1000 mg per day per adult human. A typical dosage for parenteral administration is in the range of from about 0.01 mg to about 300 mg per day per adult human. The dosages may be administered in single or divided doses, for example one to several times daily.<br>

The competent cell, Escherichia coll HB101 (Toyobo), was transformed according to usual method and then selection of the transformants was performed on the LB agar medium containing 50 (xg/mL of kanamycin. After the plasmid DNA was extracted and purified from the one of the transformants, amplifying of the DNA fragment coding for human SGLT2 was performed by the Pfu DNA Polymerase (Stratagene) -used PCR reaction, in which the following oligo nucleotides 0714F and 0715R, presented as Sequence Number 3 and 4 respectively, were used as the primers. The amplified DNA fragment was digested with restriction enzymes, Xho I and Hind III, and then purified with Wizard Purification System (Promega). This purified DNA fragment was inserted at the corresponding multi-cloning sites of pcDNA3.1 (-) Myc/His-B (Invitrogen), a vector for expressing of fusion protein. The competent cell, Escherichia coll HB101 (Toyobo), was transformed according to usual method and then selection of the transf ormant was performed on the LB agar medium containing 100 [ig/mL of ampicillin. After the plasmid DNA was extracted and purified from this transf ormant, the base sequence of the DNA fragment inserted at the multi-cloning sites of pcDNAS.l (-) Myc/His-B was analyzed. This clone had a single base substitution (ATC which codes for the isoleucine-433 was substituted by GTC) compared with the human SGLT2 reported by Wells et al (Am. J. Physiol., Vol. 263, pp. 459-465 (1992)).<br>
Sequentially, a clone in which valine is substituted for the isoleucine-433 was obtained. This plasmid vector expressing human SGLT2 in which the peptide presented as Sequence Number 5 is fused to the carboxyl terminal alanine residue was designated KL29.<br>
Sequence Number 1	ATGGAGGAGCACACAGAGGC<br>
Sequence Number 2	GGCATAGAAGCCCCAGAGGA<br>
Sequence Number 3	AACCTCGAGATGGAGGAGCACACAGAGGC<br>
Sequence Number 4	AACAAGCTTGGCATAGAAGCCCCAGAGGA<br>
Sequence Number 5	KLGPEQKLISEEDLNSAVDHHHHHH<br>
2) Preparation of the cells expressing transiently human SGLT2 KL29 , the plasmid coding human SGLT2. was transf ected into COS-7 cells (RIKEN CELL BANK RCB0539) by electroporation. Electroporation was performed with GENE PULSER II (Bio-Rad Laboratories) under the condition: 0.290 kV, 975 \iF, 2 x 106 cells of COS-7 cell and 20 [Ag of KL29 in 500 }AL of OPTI-MEM I medium (Gibco-BRL : LIFE TECHNOLOGIES) in the 0 .4 cm type cuvette. After the gene transfer, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended with OPTI-MEM I medium (1 mL/cuvette) . To each well in 96-wells plate, 125 \iL of this cell suspension was added. After overnight culture at 37 "C under 5 % CO2, 125 \tL of DMEM medium which is containing 10 % of fetal bovine serum (Sanko Jyunyaku), 100 units/mL sodium penicillin G (Gibco-BRL : LIFE TECHNOLOGIES), 100 \ig/mL streptomycin sulfate (Gibco-BRL : LIFE TECHNOLOGIES) was added<br>
to each well. After a culture until the following day, these cells were used for the measurement of the inhibitory activity against the uptake of methyl-a-D-glucopyranoside.<br>
3) Measurement of the inhibitory activity against the uptake of methyl-a-D-glucopyranoside<br>
After a test compound was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and diluted with the uptake buffer (a pH 7.4 buffer containing 140 mM sodium chloride, 2 mM potassium chloride, 1 mM calcium<br>
chloride, 1 mM magnesium chloride, 5 mM methyl-a-D-glucopyranoside, 10 mM 2-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethane sulfonic acid and 5mM tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane), each diluent was used as test sample for measurement of the inhibitory activity. After removal of the medium of the COS-7 cells expressing transiently human SGLT2, to each well 200 piL of the pretreatment buffer (a pH 7.4 buffer containing 140 mM choline chloride, 2 mM potassium chloride, 1 mM calcium chloride, 1 mM magnesium chloride, 10 mM 2-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazihyl]ethane sulfonic acid and 5 mM tris(hydroxy-methyl)aminomethane) was added, and the cells were incubated at 37° C for 10 minutes. After the pretreatment buff er was removed, 200 \JiL of the same buffer was added again, and the cells were incubated at 37° C for 10 minutes. The buffer for measurement was prepared by adding of 7 piL of methyl-a-D-(U-14C) glucopyranoside (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to 525 ^iL of the prepared test sample. For the control, the buffer for measurement without test compound was prepared. For estimate<br>
of the basal uptake in the absence of test compound and sodium, the buffer for measurement of the basal uptake, which contains 140 inM choline chloride in place of sodium chloride, was prepared similarly. After the pretreatment buffer was removed, 75 ^L of the buffer for measurement was added to each well, the cells were incubated at 37° C for 2 hours. After the buffer for<br>
measurement was removed, 200 \iL of the washing buffer (a pH 7.4 buffer containing 140 mM choline chloride, 2 mM potassium chloride, 1 mM calcium chloride, I mM magnesium chloride, 10<br>
mM methyl-a-D-glucopyranoside, 10 mM 2-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethane sulfonic acid and 5 mM tris(hydroxy-methyl)aminomethane)was added to each well and immediately removed. After two additional washing, the cells were solubilized by addition of 75 ^L of 0.2 N sodium hydroxide to each well. After the cell lysates were transferred to the<br>
PicoPlate (Packard) and 150 jJiL of MicroScint-40 (Packard) was added to each well, the radioactivity was measured with microplate scintillation counter TopCount (Packard). The difference in uptake was obtained as 100 % value by subtracting the radioactivity in the basal uptake from that in control and then the concentrations at which 50 % of uptake was inhibited (IC50 Value) were calculated from the concentration-inhibition curve by least square method. The result is shown in the following Table 1.<br><br>
