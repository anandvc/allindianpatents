COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10,rule 13<br>
WIRELESS NETWORK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM<br>
ANDREW CORPORATION of 10500 WEST 153RD STREET, ORLAND PARK, ILLINOIS 60462, U.S.A., AMERICAN Company<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br><br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a method and apparatus for managing a wireless network.  The invention may be used in a wireless network which communicates with mobile devices (such as cellphones or PDAs), for instance a cellular or PCS network.  The invention could also be used in other types of wireless networks, such as wireless Local Area Networks (LANs).<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is known to adjust the beam characteristics of the base station antennas in order to efficiently utilize network resources.   US 6141565 describes a system which determines network conditions, and selects a network parameter optimized with respect to the determined network conditions.  The network conditions are determined by monitoring selected network attributes, such as signal levels, bit error rates, frame error rates, voice quality measurement, data throughput, packet success probabilities, dropped call rates, ca origination and/or termination success rates, or the like.   The network parameters adjusted at thej base station may include sector orientation/rotation, sector or beam outboard reach, through attenuation or gain adjustment and/or antenna downtilt/uptilt.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT<br>
A preferred embodiment of the invention provides a method of managing a wireless communication network, the network including a plurality of antennas for communicating with devices via antenna beams, each antenna beam having a set of beam parameters, the method including the steps of:<br>
a)	receiving a request from a device;<br>
b)	modifying a first antenna beam in response to the request by adjusting one or more of the beam parameters of the first antenna beam; and<br><br><br><br>
2<br><br>
c)   communicating with the, device via the modified first antenna beam.<br>
In contrast with US 6141565 (which adjusts parameters in response to changes in overall network conditions), the invention adjusts parameters in direct response to a request from a specific device.<br>
The method of the preferred embodiment may also include the steps of transmitting a query to the device in response to the request, receiving a query response from the device; and performing step b) in accordance with the query response.  For instance, the query may ask the user of the device whether they are willing to pay a fee for immediate download or upload, or whether they are willing to accept a certain download or upload time.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The accompanying drawings which are incorporated in and constitute part of the specification, illustrate embodiments of the invention and, together with the general description of the invention given above, and the detailed description of the embodiments given beiow, serve to explain the principles of the invention.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
3<br><br>
Referring to Figure 1, a cellular wireless network has a network of cells 1 -4, each ceil being serviced by a respective base station 5-8. Each base station both transmits downlink signals to and receives uplink signals from mobile devices which are registered in its respective cell.<br>
The base stations 5-8 are controlled by a Network Management System (NMS) 10 shown in Figure 2.    The NMS is a software product running on a central server (not shown).<br>
Three alternative network management procedures will now be illustrated with reference to Figures 3 and 4 (Example 1), Figures 5, 6 and 7 (Example 2), and Figures 8 and 9 (Example 3) which each show a set of beams for servicing one of the cells 1-4.<br>
Example 1<br>
Each base station 5-8 has an array of antennas with a multi-beam radiation pattern shown in Figure 3,   Each beam 20-25 services a respective 60 degree sector of the cell 1.<br>
A paiij of mobile devices 30,31 are registered with beam' 21'.'  The method of Example 1 is as follows:<br>
1.	Mobile device 31 sends a request to the NMS 10, requesting download of a large data file.<br>
2.	The NMS 10 then sends a reply to the mobile device 31 depending on the size of the requested file. If the file meets or exceeds a predetermined threshold, then a message is sent to the mobile device 31 for display to a user, such as: "Thank you for your 100Mb data request. If you wish to receive the data now, then please press 1.  This will attract a surcharge of $10.  If you are able to receive the data later, then please press 0 and the data will be sent to you at a later time with no surcharge".<br>
3.	If the user enters "1", then the NMS 10 adjusts the network parameters to enable<br>
the data download. In this example, the network parameters are adjusted by:<br><br>
«•<br><br>
4<br><br>
a.   focusing the beam 21 onto the mobile device 31 as shown in Figure 4;<br>
b.	deregistering the mobile device 30 from the beam 21;<br>
c.	broadening the adjacent beam 20 as shown in Figure 4; and<br>
d.	registering the mobile device 30 with the beam 20.<br>
4.	The data download to device 31 is then made via focused beam 21.<br>
5.	If the user enters "0" then the NMS 10 determines the Best Time for Download (BTD).  This is done by performing a historical analysis of the network (for instance over the last month) to determine when the lowest data rates are being handled by the network.   For instance this may turn out to be at 2am on a Tuesday morning.<br>
6.	The NMS 10 then sends a message to the mobile device such as "Download scheduled for 2am Tuesday. OK?"<br>
7.	If the BTD is acceptable, then the user inputs an OK message and the data is downloaded at the BTD. The NMS 10 makes any necessary network changes at the BTD, such as the changes described above.<br>
Example 2<br>
Referring now to Figure 5, three mobile devices 40-42 are registered with beam 21.  The method of Example 2 is as follows:<br>
1.	Mobile devices 40-42 send requests to the NMS 10, requesting downloads of 500Kb, 5Mb and 10Mb files respectively.<br>
2.	Since the 500Kb file is below a preset threshold (for example a 1Mb threshold), the NMS 10 immediately downloads the 500Kb file to device 40 via beam 21.<br>
3.	At the same time as downloading the file to device 40, the NMS monitors the present network parameters and calculates how long the 5Mb and 10Mb downloads will take.<br><br>
4.	The NMS then sends messages to devices 41 and 42, such as: "if you decide to download now, the download will take X minutes" (X being the value calculated in the previous step). "If you wish to receive the data now, then please press 1.   If you are able to receive the data later, then please press 0 and the data will be sent to you at a later time."<br>
5.	If the device 42 enters "1" and the device 41 enters "0", then the NMS 10 adjusts the network parameters as shown in Figure 6 by:<br>
a.	focusing the beam 21 onto the mobile device 42;<br>
b.	deregistering the mobile devices 40,41 from the beam 21;<br>
c.	broadening the adjacent beam 20; and<br>
d.	registering the mobile devices 40,41 with the beam 20.<br>
6J The 10Mb data download to device 42 is then made via focused beam 21,<br>
i<br>
7.	The NMS 10 determines the Best Time for Download (BTD) for the 5Mb file to device 41.  This is done by performing a historicararia lysis of the network (for instance over the last month) to determine when the lowest data rates are being handled by the network.   For instance this may turn out to be at 2am on a Tuesday morning.<br>
8.	The NMS 10 then sends a message to the mobile device 41 such as "Download scheduled for 2am Tuesday. OK?"<br>
9.	If the BTD is acceptable, then the user inputs an OK message and the data is downloaded at the BTD.  The NMS 10 makes any necessary network changes at the BTD, iuch as the changes described above.<br>
10.If both of the devices 41,42 enter "1", then the NMS 10 adjusts the network parameters as shown in Figure 7 by:<br>
a.	focusing the beam 21 onto the mobile device 41;<br>
b.	deregistering the mobile devices 40,42 from the beam 21;<br>
6<br><br>
c.   focusing the beam 22 onto the mobile device 42;<br>
d.	registering the mobile device 42 with the beam 22;<br>
e.	broadening beams 20 and 23; and<br>
f.	registering the mobile device 40 with the beam 20.<br>
11 .The 5Mb data download to device 41 is then made via focused beam 21 and the 10Mb data download to device 42 is made via focused beam 22.<br>
Example 3<br>
Starting from the situation shown in Figure 5 {with three mobile devices 40-42 registered with beam 21), the method of Example 3 is as follows:<br>
1.	Mobile devices 40-42 send requests to the NMS 10, requesting downloads of 500Kb, 5Mb and 10Mb files respectively.<br>
2.	Since the 500Kb file is below a preset threshold (for example a 1Mb threshold), the NMS 10 immediately downloads the 500m file to device 40 via beam 21.<br>
3.	Since the 5Mb and 10Mb files are above the 1Mb threshold, the NMS 10 places the requests in a queue.  The order of the queue is based on the time of receipt of the request.  If the requests are received simultaneously, then the smaller file is placed in the queue above the larger file.  In this example, the 5Mb request for device 41 is placed in the queue above the 10Mb request for device 42.<br>
4.	The NMS 10 adjusts the network parameters as shown in Figure 8 by:<br>
a.	focusing the beam 21 onto the mobile device 41,'<br>
b.	deregistering the mobile devices 40,41 from the beam 21;<br>
c.	broadening the adjacent beams 20,22;<br>
d.	registering the mobile device 40 with the beam 20; and<br>
e.	registering the mobile device 42 with the beam 22.<br>
5.	The 5Mb data download to device 41 is then made via focused beam 21.<br>
7<br><br>
6.	At the same time as step 4, the NMS monitors the present network parameters and calculates how long the 5Mb download will take.<br>
7.	The NMS 10 then sends a message to device 42 such as: "since your request is greater than 1Mb, you have been placed in a queue.  We estimate that download will commence in Y minutes" (Y being the value calculated in the previous step).<br>
8.	At the end of the 5Mb download to device 41, the NMS 10 adjusts the network parameters as shown in Figure 9 by:<br>
a.	focusing the beam 21 onto the mobile device 42;<br>
b.	deregistering the mobile devices 40,41,42 from the beams 20,21,22;<br>
c.	narrowing the beam 22 to its original 60 degree width;<br>
d.	broadening the beam 20;<br>
e.	registering the mobile devices 40,41 with the beam 20; and<br>
f.	registering the mobile device 42 with the beam 21.<br>
9.	The 10Mb data download to device 42 is then wade via focused beam 21.<br>
Beam modification is performed in Examples 1-3 above by narrowing the azimutha! beam width and/or adjusting the azimuth beam angle.  However* other beam pattern parameters ' may be adjusted such as elevation beam width or elevation beam angle !ie downtilt). Various suitable methods of adjusting these beam pattern parameters are described in WO 02/05383.<br>
More specifically, as described in WO 02/05383, each base station may have a number of antennas for communicating with the mobile devices via an antenna beam having a width, azimuth angle and downtilt angle, the antenna including: a two dimensional array of radiating elements; and a feed network from a feed line to the radiating elements, the feed network including: downtilt phase shifting means for varying the phase of signals supplied to or received from the radiating elements so as to vary the downtilt angle of the antenna beam; azimuth phase shifting means for varying the phase of signals supplied to or received from the radiating elements so as to vary the azimuth angle of the antenna beam;<br>
8<br><br>
and beam width adjustment means for varying the power or phase of signals supplied to or received from the radiating elements so as to vary the width of the antenna beam.<br>
Alternatively, as also described in WO 02/05383, each base station may have a number of antennas for communicating with the mobile devices via an antenna beam having a width and an angle, the antenna including: a plurality of radiating elements; and a feed network from a feed line to the radiating elements, the feed network including: power dividing means for varying the division of power between radiating elements so as to vary the width of the antenna beam; and<br>
phase shifting means for varying the phase of signals supplied to or received from the radiating elements so as to vary the angle of the antenna beam.<br>
Typically the or each phase shifting means is adjusted by varying the relative position of two or more phase shifting components.<br>
As an alternative to the beam pattern adjustments described in WO 02/05383, the beam power may be adjusted.<br>
The adjustments described above in Examples 1-3 maximize the data transfer rate and make efficient use of the network resources, giving savings in operating expenses.<br>
Although Examples 1-3 above are given for a download td the mobile device, a similar process will be followed for an upload from the mobile device.<br>
