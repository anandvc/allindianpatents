[Title of the Invention] MOUNTING STRUCTURE OF SOUND SYSTEM IN MOTORCYCLE<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a mounting structure of a sound system in a motorcycle.<br>
[Background Art]<br>
[0002]<br>
Conventionally, there has been known a motorcycle which mounts a sound system such as a speaker and an amplifier thereon, In the conventional motorcycle of this type, the sound system is mounted on the vehicle by forming a space dedicated for mounting the sound system in a front side of a vehicle and by arranging the sound system in the space (see patent document 1  for example).<br>
Further, there also exists a motorcycle which mounts an electronic key system thereon. In such a motorcycle, a handle locking device which is interlocked with the electronic key system is provided, and the handle locking device is arranged on a side of a head pipe in the inside of a vehicle body cover which is arranged on a front side of the vehicle body (see patent document 2, for example).<br>
[Patent Document 1]  JP-B-3-49794 [Patent Document 2]  JP-A-2005-119421<br><br>
[Disclosure of the Invention]<br>
[Problems that the Invention is to solve]<br>
[0003]<br>
Here, a sound system such as an amplifier or a speaker is often large-sized and hence, a space in which the sound system is arranged becomes inevitably large. In a motorcycle which arranges a storing box for storing articles such as papers and small articles on a front side of a vehicle, for ensuring the above-mentioned space, there is no way but to design the storing box in a compact shape. However, with respect to a motorcycle, particularly with respect to a scooter-type motorcycle, a size of a storing capacity of the storing box is one of charms which a product appeals, and there has been a demand for obviating the reduction of storing capacity.<br>
Further, in the motorcycle which mounts the electronic key system thereon, a handle locking device interlocked with the electronic key system constitutes a part larger than a usual mechanical-key-type handle locking device. Accordingly, in mounting a sound system on the motorcycle, it is difficult to ensure a space for the handle locking device and hence, a layout of this type of part is restricted. [0004]<br>
The present invention has been made under such circumstances and it is an object of the present invention to provide a mounting structure of a sound system in a motorcycle<br><br>
which can effectively store a sound part without reducing an article storing capacity of a storing box or even when the motorcycle includes a handle locking device interlocked with an electronic key system. [Means for Solving the Problem] [0005]<br>
The present invention is characterized in that, in a motorcycle in which a vehicle body frame which supports a handle steering portion and an engine is covered with a vehicle body cover, a storing box which stores articles is arranged inside the vehicle body cover, and a sound operation device which instructs a reproduction operation or the like of a sound part is arranged in the vicinity of the handle steering portion, the sound part is arranged in the inside of a space which is surrounded by the storing box and the vehicle body cover.<br>
According to the present invention, the sound part is arranged in a space which is originally provided between the vehicle body cover and the storing box and hence, it is possible to effectively make use of a dead space attributed to the space and, at the same time, the reduction of the storing capacity of the storing box can be suppressed. In a scooter-type motorcycle in which a storing space is limited, it is possible to effectively arrange a sound part. [0006]<br>
In this case, out of the above-mentioned vehicle body<br><br>
cover, the storing box may be formed of an inner box formed in an inner cover which covers the handle steering portion from behind.<br>
When the sound part is arranged in the vicinity of the inner box, a distance between the sound part and a sound operation device which is mounted on the handle steering portion can be shortened thus facilitating the wiring connection between the sound part and the sound operation device.<br>
Further, the vehicle body frame may include a head pipe which steerablly supports a handle and a down frame which extends rearwardly and downwardly in the longitudinal direction of a vehicle from the head pipe, a power unit which includes the engine may be arranged below the down frame, and the storing box may be arranged in the vicinity of the head pipe.<br>
In this constitution, the sound part and the engine may be arranged largely remote from each other. By separating the sound part from the engine which constitutes a noise generating source, it is possible to reduce the influence of the noises of the engine asserted on the sound part. [0007]<br>
The vehicle body cover may be formed of a meter panel which covers the storing box from above.<br>
By arranging the sound part below the meter panel, it<br><br>
is possible to ensure a waterproof property of the sound part and a dead space formed on a front side of the vehicle can be effectively used.<br>
Further, the speaker may be mounted on the meter panel and, at the same time, an escape portion for avoiding the speaker may be formed on the sound part.<br>
In arranging the sound part below the meter panel, the escape portion for avoiding the speaker is formed in the sound part for preventing the speaker which is mounted on the meter panel and the sound part from interfering with each other and hence, the sound part and the speaker can be arranged close to each other thus eliminating a useless space. Accordingly, it is possible to form the constitution around the handle in a further compact shape. [0008]<br>
The present invention is also characterized in that, in a motorcycle in which a vehicle body frame which supports a handle steering portion and an engine thereon is covered with a vehicle body cover, and a sound operation device which instructs a reproduction operation or the like of a sound part is arranged in the vicinity of the handle steering portion, the motorcycle includes a handle locking device which makes steering of a handle inoperable during parking and mounts an electronic key system interlocked with the handle locking J  device thereon, the vehicle body frame includes a head pipe<br><br>
which steerably supports a handle steering shaft connected to the handle, the handle locking device is arranged in the inside of a space surrounded by one side of the handle steering shaft and the vehicle body cover, and the sound part is arranged in a space surrounded by another side of the handle steering shaft and the vehicle body cover.<br>
In the present invention, the handle locking device and the sound part are respectively arranged on one side and another side of the handle steering shaft separately and hence, even when a large-sized handle locking device interlocked with an electronic key system is mounted on the motorcycle, the sound part can be mounted on the side at which the handle locking device is not arranged whereby it is possible to efficiently arrange the sound part. [0009]<br>
In this case, the sound operation device may include an operation unit which is provided separately from the sound part, and the operation unit may be arranged on a portion of the vehicle body cover above the sound part and behind the handle steering portion.<br>
The operation unit provided separately from the sound part is arranged on the vehicle body cover behind the handle steering portion above the sound part and hence, it is possible to arrange the operation unit at a position where the operation unit  can exhibit  excellent  operability without  being<br><br>
influenced by a position of the sound part. [0010]<br>
Further, the handle locking device may be arranged on a side surface of the head pipe and a small storing box may be arranged in a space defined between the handle locking device and the vehicle body cover. On the other hand, a large storing box may be arranged in a space arranged on a side opposite to the head pipe which is covered with the vehicle body cover, and the sound part may be arranged in a space surrounded by an upper surface wall of the large storing box and the vehicle body cover.<br>
Due to such a constitution, by making use of a dead space surrounded by the upper surface wall of the large storing box and the vehicle body cover, it is possible to efficiently arrange the sound part. [0011]<br>
Further, operation switches or buttons for manipulating or operating functions interlocked with the above-mentioned electronic key system may be arranged to face an outer surface of the vehicle body cover on which the operation unit of the sound operation device is arranged.<br>
Here, the functions interlocked with the electronic key system means functions whose manipulations or operations are restricted by the electronic key system, and the handle locking device is one of such functions.<br><br>
In such a constitution, the switches or the buttons for operating the functions interlocked with the electronic key system are arranged to face the outer surface of the vehicle body cover on which the operation unit of the sound operation device is arranged, and a distance between the rider and the switches or the buttons can be shortened and hence, the operability of the switches or the buttons can be enhanced. [0012]<br>
Further, the operation unit may be configured such that the operation unit includes an upper casing having a plurality of operation portions, a lower casing having a printed circuit board for detecting an operation of the operation portion, and a sheet-like sealing member which is interposed between both of the casings. An opening into which a shaft connected to the printed circuit board of the lower casing penetrates is formed in the sealing member, an annular projecting portion which projects toward the upper casing side and a thick wall portion which is formed on a distal end of the projecting portion are formed on a peripheral portion of the opening, and a groove portion in which the thick wall portion is fitted is formed in the upper casing side. The thick wall portion can be deformed with the insertion thereof into the groove portion thus connecting the upper casing side and the sealing member.<br>
In such a constitution, the thick wall portion of the sealing member which is connected to the groove portion formed<br><br>
in the upper casing side is formed on the sealing member in an erected manner and hence, the thick wall portion which constitutes a connection portion can be arranged at a desired position of the sealing member thus increasing the degree of freedom in the arrangement of the connection portion. [Advantage of the Invention] [0013]<br>
According to the present invention, the sound part is arranged in the space which is originally provided between the vehicle body cover and the storing box and hence, it is possible to effectively make use of the dead space attributed to the space and, at the same time, the reduction of the storing capacity of the storing box can be suppressed. Accordingly, in the scooter-type motorcycle in which the storing space is limited, it is possible to efficiently arrange the sound part.<br>
Further, the sound part is arranged in the vicinity of the inner box and hence, a distance between the sound part and the sound operation device which is mounted on the handle steering portion can be shortened thus facilitating the wiring connection between the sound part and the sound operation device.<br>
The power unit including the engine is arranged below the down frame and the storing box is arranged in the vicinity of the head pipe and hence, the sound part and the engine can be arranged remote from each other.   Accordingly,  by<br><br>
separating the sound part from the engine which constitutes the noise generating source, it is possible to reduce the influence of the noises of the engine asserted on the sound part.<br>
Further, the sound part is arranged below the meter panel and hence, the waterproof property of the sound part can be ensured, and it is possible to effectively make use of the dead space on the front side of the vehicle.<br>
Still further, in arranging the sound part below the meter panel, the escape portion for avoiding the speaker is formed in the sound part for preventing the speaker mounted on the meter panel and the sound part from interfering with each other and hence, the sound part and the speaker can be arranged close to each other thus eliminating a useless space. Accordingly, it is possible to form the constitution around the handle in a further compact shape. [0014]<br>
Further, according to the present invention, the handle locking device and the sound part are respectively separately arranged on one side and another side of the handle steering shaft and hence, even when the large-sized handle locking device interlocked with the electronic key system is mounted on the motorcycle, the sound part can be mounted on the side at which the handle locking device is not arranged thus efficiently arranging the sound part.<br><br>
Further, the operation portion which is provided separately from the sound part is arranged on the vehicle body cover behind the handle steering portion above the sound part and hence, it is possible to arrange the operation unit at the position where excellent operability can be obtained without being influenced by the position of the sound part.<br>
Further, by making use of the dead space surrounded by the upper wall surface of the large storing box and the vehicle body cover, it is possible to efficiently arrange the sound part.<br>
Further, the switches or the buttons for operating the functions interlocked with the electronic key system are arranged to face the outer surface of the vehicle body cover on which the operation portion of the sound operation device is arranged and hence, the distance between the rider and the switches or the buttons can be shortened and hence, the operability of the switches or the buttons can be enhanced.<br>
Further, the thick wall portion is formed on the sealing member in an erected manner and hence, the thick wall portion which constitutes the connection portion can be arranged at the desired position of the sealing member thus increasing the degree of freedom in the arrangement of the connection portion. [Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention] [0015]<br>

[0022]<br>
The unit swing engine UE is constituted of a water-cooled engine E which arranges a cylinder axis thereof approximately horizontally and a belt-type continuously variable transmission M which transmits an output of the engine E to the rear wheel WR by changing an output of the engine E using a transmission belt and pulleys in a continuously variable manner. The continuously variable transmission M drives a crankshaft-side drive pulley in response to an operation of an electric motor 42 which constitutes a transmission actuator so as to change a transmission ratio in a continuously variable manner. A transmission case 43 of the continuously variable transmission M is contiguously mounted on a left side of the crankcase 44 in the engine E in a state that the transmission case 43 projects from the engine E, and the transmission case 43 extends to a left side of the rear wheel WR.  Further, on<br><br>
rear ends of both upper down frames 37, that is, on lower ends of the upper down frames 37, brackets 65 are mounted, and main stands 66 are rotatably supported on both brackets 65. By making the main stands 66 stand upright, it is possible to make the scooter-type vehicle stand by itself with the rear wheel WR held in a floated state. When the scooter-type vehicle is in a traveling state, the main stands 66 may be stored in a state that the rear wheel WR comes into contact with a ground. [0023]<br>
Fig. 2 is a perspective view of a steering portion of the scooter-type vehicle including the steering handle 26, and Fig. 3 is a view of the steering portion as viewed in the axial direction of the head pipe 27. In Fig. 2, numeral 50 indicates a handle post. The handle post 50 is, as shown in Fig. 1, mounted on an upper end of the steering stem 51 which is supported on the head pipe 27 . On an upper surface of the handle post 50, as shown in Fig. 2, the steering handle 26 is mounted by way of a pair of holders 52, while on the steering handle 26, a brake master cylinder 53, a brake lever 54 and the like are mounted in addition to the back mirror 17 6 and the switch case 178 described above. [0024]<br>
The meter panel 173 which integrally forms the meter visor 173a on a front portion thereof is arranged in front of the steering handle 26. Further, as shown in Fig. 2 and Fig.<br><br>
3, on the meter panel 173, a meter 55 which is provided for displaying information on the vehicle such as a vehicle speed and an engine rotational speed and a pair of speakers 56 which is arranged adjacent to both sides of the meter 55 are mounted. [0025]<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, the pair of speakers 56 respectively includes an approximately cylindrical case body 56a, and the case body 56a is arranged in a state that the case body 56a extends in approximately parallel with the above-mentioned steering stems 51 and is inclined in the direction toward a front side of the vehicle body. As shown in Fig. 4, the meter 55 includes a lower case 57, a meter body 58, a reflector plate 59 and a lens assembly 60, and the meter 55 is constituted by assembling these parts. The lower case 57, the reflector plate 59 and the lens assembly 60 have the approximately same profile, and on both peripheral portions of the respective parts, escape portions 61, 62 which are indented inwardly in an approximately arcuate shape are formed. [0026]<br>
As shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, the escape portions 61, 62 correspond to an approximately circular shape of the speakers 56 which are arranged on both sides of the meter 55, and outer peripheral portions of the speakers 56 are arranged close to and fitted in the escape portions 61, 62 and hence, it is possible to decrease a longitudinal size of the meter<br><br>
panel 173. Due to such a constitution, the meter panel 173 per se is miniaturized and hence, the constitution around the handle steering portion can be formed in a compact shape. On the meter 55, various kinds of display means on the vehicle such as a fuel gauge 55a of a fuel tank, a speedometer 55b, a digital display clock 55c, an engine tachometer 55d and a water temperature gauge 55e are mounted in order from a left side in the drawing. On the above-mentioned escape portions 61, 62 sides which are arranged close to the speakers 56, as the display means other than the speedometer 55b and the engine tachometer 55d, the water temperature gauge 55e, the fuel gauge 55a and the like are respectively arranged. The water temperature gauge 55e, the fuel gauge 55a and the like do not display required information during traveling and hence, these parts are compactly displayed on the" meter side portions arranged close to the speakers 56. Due to such a constitution, the speedometer 55b, the engine tachometer 55d and the like for displaying particularly required information during traveling are displayed on the center of the meter in a magnified manner thus enhancing the visibility of these parts. [0027]<br>
In this constitution, around the above-mentioned handle steering portion, a sound operation device 70 which instructs a reproduction operation and the like of the sound system is mounted. The sound operation device 7 0 is formed as a body<br><br>
separate from the meter 55 and, as shown in Fig. 3, the sound operation device 70 is arranged behind the head pipe 27 as viewed in the axial direction of the head pipe 27 (see Fig. 1) , that is, on a rider side. The meter 55 is arranged in front of the head pipe 27, that is, on a side remote from the rider side. [0028]<br>
The sound operation device 70 includes an operation unit<br>
72,	and an approximately arcuate escape portion 73 in which<br>
an outer peripheral portion of the handle post 50 is fitted<br>
is formed on a front periphery of the operation unit 72. On<br>
a surface of the operation unit 72, a laterally elongated<br>
display portion 74 which displays the sound reproduction<br>
information or the like thereon is mounted in a state that the<br>
display potion 74 is arranged adjacent to the escape portion<br>
73.	Further, a plurality of operation portions 71 is arranged<br>
in an approximately lateral row in approximately parallel to<br>
the display portion 74. These operation portions 71 are<br>
constituted of an external sound input operation portion (AUX)<br>
71a, an AM radio operation portion 71b, an FM radio operation<br>
portion 71c (these three parts described above being referred<br>
to as sound source switching operation portions) , a minus tuner<br>
71d for performing the selection of radio station or the<br>
selection of music, a volume control portion 71e on a control<br>
of a sound volume, a plus tuner 71f for performing the selection<br><br>
of a radio station or the selection of music, a traffic information receiving operation portion 71g, a muting electronic volume control portion 71h, and a low-and-high sound balance adjusting operation portion 71i for performing a sound operation and the like in order from a left side in the drawing. A power source operation portion 71j is arranged on a lateral side of the display portion 74. In this constitution, the volume control portion 71e is arranged in the vicinity of the steering portion and, at the same time, at an approximately center portion of the operation unit 72 of the sound operation device 70.<br>
[0029]<br>
Fig. 5 is a view of the sound operation device 70 as viewed from a rider's seat side, and Fig, 6 is a view as viewed from a rider's seat side in a state that the sound operation device 70 is removed. As shown in Fig. 5, the inner box (a storing box) 75 which is formed in the above-mentioned inner cover 158a<br>
(see. Fig. 1) is arranged below the sound operation device 70, and in left and right openings 75a, 75b formed in the inner box 75, a pocket cowl 77 (see Fig. 1) with a pocket cover 76<br>
(Fig. 1) is arranged for storing small articles in a drawable manner. Numeral 7 8 indicates an engine start switch. As shown in Fig. 6, a space K is defined between an upper surface of the inner box 75 and the meter panel 173 on which the meter visor 173a is integrally formed.<br><br>
Fig. 7 is a side view showing the constitution around the inner box 75, Fig. 8 is a top plan view showing such a constitution, and Fig. 9 is a perspective view showing such a constitution. As shown in Fig. 7, the above-mentioned space K is an approximately triangular space K in a side view which is surrounded by an upper surface of the inner box 75 which is arranged approximately horizontally, the meter panel 173 which is arranged in an approximately inclined manner in the frontward and upward direction with a predetermined angle, and case bodies 56a of the speakers 56 which are arranged in an approximately inclined manner in the frontward and downward direction with a predetermined angle. A side surface portion of the space K is covered with the front side cover 157. With respect to the space K, in the inside of a space Kl which is positioned above a left opening 75a of the inner box 75, as shown in Fig. 7 to Fig, 9, a sound part 7 9 is arranged in an approximately horizontal state. The sound part 7 9 constitutes the sound system and is connected to a battery power source, the pair of speakers 56 and the sound operation device 70 by way of connectors 79d (Fig. 7) . Further, although not shown in the drawing, the sound part 79 houses a power amplifier which changes a sound volume in an interlocking manner with an operation of the volume control portion 71e, AM and FM radio receivers which are connected to an antenna (not shown in the<br><br>
drawing) arranged on a rear portion of a vehicle body by way of an antenna line 79e (Fig. 7) and the like. Further, the sound part 7 9 includes an external sound input terminal for connecting a portable audio player (not shown in the drawing) , a connection terminal for a control line and the like. These terminals (not shown in the drawing) extend into the inside of an inner space of the left opening 7 5a of the inner box 75 which is positioned approximately right below the sound part 7 9, and the terminals can be connected to the portable audio player in the inside of the space. A casing of the sound part 7 9 has an approximately rectangular shape. On a deep end portion of the casing of the sound part 79, an escape portion 79a (Fig. 7) which is inclined in the oblique frontward direction for avoiding the case body 56a is formed for preventing the casing of the sound part 7 9 from interfering with the case body 56a of the speaker 56. [0031]<br>
In this constitution, as shown in Fig. 1, the sound part 79 and the unit swing engine UE are largely separated from each other in distance. The unit swing engine UE is arranged below the pair of left and right upper down frames 37 which is contiguously mounted on the head pipe 27 and extends in the rearward and downward direction, and the sound part 79 is arranged in the vicinity of the handle steering portion as described  above.    According  to  the  above-mentioned<br><br>
constitution, the sound part 79 is separated from the engine E which constitutes a noise generating source and hence, it is possible to reduce the influence of the noises of the engine E asserted on the sound part 79. [0032]<br>
Next, the manner of operation of the sound system is explained.<br>
In Fig. 3, when the sound system is turned on using the power source operation portion 71j and either one of the AM radio operation portion 71b and the FM radio operation portion 71c is operated, a sound source is switched to either one of the AM radio sound source and the FM radio sound source. Then, by operating the operation portion 71, it is possible to play the above-mentioned radio sound source using the pair of speakers 56 which is arranged in the vicinity of the handle steering portion. Here, by operating either one of the minus tuner 71d and the plus tuner 71f, it is possible to select the radio station, and by operating the volume control portion 71e which is arranged at an approximately center of the sound system, it is possible to control a sound volume. By operating the traffic information receiving operation portion 71g, the sound source is switched to a mode for receiving traffic information on a speedway, and by operating the muting electronic volume control portion 71h, the sound source is switched to a muting mode.<br><br>
The portable audio player, for example, an i-Pod (a registered trade mark) is connected to the respective terminals (not shown in the drawings) which extend into the inside of the inner space of the left opening 75a of the inner box 75, and the sound source of the sound system is switched to an external sound input mode by operating the external sound input operation portion 71a. Thereafter, by operating the operation portion 71, it is possible to play a music stored in the portable audio player using the pair of speakers 56 which is arranged in the vicinity of the handle steering portion. In this case, by operating either one of the minus tuner 7Id and the plus tuner 71f, the selection of music is performed, while by operating the volume control portion 71e arranged at the approximately center of the sound system, a volume control is performed. Also in this case, by operating the traffic information receiving operation portion 71g, the external sound input mode is switched to a mode for receiving traffic information on a speedway, while by operating the muting electronic volume control portion 71h, the external sound input mode is switched to a muting mode. [0034]<br>
In this constitution, as shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, the meter 55 for displaying the information on the vehicle and the sound operation device 70 which instructs the reproduction<br><br>
operation and the like in the sound system are constituted as bodies separate from each other. Accordingly, compared to the constitution in which these parts are present in mixture, the visibility of the meter 55 for the rider can be enhanced. During the traveling of the vehicle, it is necessary to confirm a meter display of the meter 55 and hence, the visibility of the meter 55 is important. However, the meter 55 is arranged in front of the head pipe 27, that is, on a side remote from the rider and hence, the sufficient visibility of the meter 55 can be ensured. Further, the sound operation device 7 0 is arranged behind the head pipe 27, that is, close to the rider side and hence, the operability of the sound operation device 70 can be enhanced while ensuring the visibility of the meter 55. [0035]<br>
On the sound operation device 70, the plurality of operation portions 71 for performing the sound operation or the selection of music is mounted. Out of these operation portions 71, the frequently-used volume control portion 71e on the volume control is arranged in the vicinity of the steering portion and on the center portion of the operation unit 72 of the sound operation device 70. Accordingly, when the rider performs a handle operation, the volume control portion 71e is always held close to the center of the steering portion thus further facilitating the operation of the volume<br><br>
control portion 71e.<br>
[0036]<br>
In this embodiment, as shown in Fig.7, in the inside of the space K which is a dead space surrounded by the upper surface of the inner box (storing box) 75, the meter panel 173 and the case body 56a of the speaker 56, the sound part 79 is arranged. Accordingly, it is possible to effectively use a dead space which originally exists in the sound system and hence, it is unnecessary to decrease a storing capacity of the storing box. Particularly, in the scooter-type vehicle, a storing space is limited and hence, by making use of the above-mentioned constitution, it is possible to efficiently arrange the sound part.<br>
[0037]<br>
In this embodiment, the sound part 7 9 is arranged on the upper surface of the inner box (storing box) 75 formed on the inner cover 158a which is arranged close to the sound operation device 70 and hence, a physical distance between the sound part 79 and the sound operation device 70 can be shortened. Accordingly, when the sound part 79 and the sound operation device 70 are connected with each other by way of the cable, a length of the cable can be shortened and hence, it is possible to prevent loosening or slacking of the cable and, at the same time, it is possible to prevent the cable from being entangled with other equipment or a vehicle-mounted device.<br><br>
[0038]<br>
In this embodiment, as shown in Fig. 7, the sound part 79 is arranged below the meter panel 173 and hence, it is unnecessary to provide specific water-proof equipment for the sound part 79 or to impart a water-proof function to the sound part 79. The waterproof-equipped meter panel 173 is used as a roof and hence, it is possible to ensure the water-proof property of the sound part 79.<br>
In this embodiment, as shown in Fig. 7, the escape portion 7 9a which is formed in an inclined manner in the oblique frontward direction for avoiding the case body 56a of the speakers 56 is formed in the sound part 79. Accordingly, when the sound part 79 is arranged in the space K, no useless space is formed between the sound part 79 and the case body 56a and hence, the sound part 79 and the case body 56a can be arranged close to each other as much as possible thus efficiently arranging the sound part 79 in the space K. [0039]<br>
In this embodiment, a terminal (not shown in the drawing) for connecting a portable audio player (not shown in the drawing) to the sound part 79 extends into the inside of the inner space of the inner box 75 and hence, the portable audio player can be connected to the sound part 79 in the inside of the space, and the inner space can be also used as a space for connecting the player. Here, in this embodiment, although the<br><br>
explanation has been made with respect to an example in which the sound part 79 is arranged between the inner box 75 and the vehicle body cover, the present invention is not limited to the above-mentioned arrangement structure, and the sound part 79 may be arranged between the other storing box, for example, the storing box 30 and the vehicle body cover. Also in this case, it is possible to obtain advantageous effects that a dead space between the storing box 30 and the vehicle body cover can be effectively used and, at the same time, the inner space of the storing box 30 can be also used as the space for connecting the player and the like. [0040]<br>
In this constitution, as shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, the escape portions 61^ 62 are formed in the meter 55, and the escape portions 61, 62 correspond to an approximately circular shape of the speakers 56 which are arranged on both sides of the meter 55 and hence, it is possible to decrease a longitudinal size of the meter panel 173 by allowing the outer peripheral portions of the speakers 56 to approach and to be fitted in the escape portions 61, 62. Due to such a constitution, the meter panel 173 per se is miniaturized and hence, it is possible to form the constitution around the handle steering portion in a compact shape. [0041]<br>
Further, in this constitution, on the meter 55, the water<br><br>
temperature gauge 55e, the fuel gauge 55a and the like which display the information unnecessary during traveling are displayed on side portions of the meter which are arranged close to the speakers 56 in a compact shape, and the speedometer 55b, the engine tachometer 55d and the like which display the information particularly necessary during traveling are displayed on the center of the meter in a magnified manner. Due to such a constitution, it is possible to enhance the visibility of these parts. [0042]<br>
The above-mentioned embodiment merely constitutes one embodiment of the present invention, and modifications and applications are arbitrarily conceivable without departing from the gist of the present invention. For example, the present invention is not limited to the scooter-type vehicle and is also applicable to various kinds of motorcycles such as a road-sport-use vehicle and a dual-purpose vehicle. [0043] [Second embodiment]<br>
Fig. 10 is a view as viewed from a rider's seat side showing a periphery of a sound operation device 70 according to a second embodiment to which the present invention is applied. Fig. 11 is a plan view with a part in cross section of a periphery of a steering portion of the sound operation device 70 in a state that a meter panel 173 is removed from the steering<br><br>
portion.<br>
In the second embodiment, parts having the substantially same constitutions as the parts of the above-mentioned first embodiment are given same numerals and their explanation is omitted.<br>
In the second embodiment of the present invention, in place of the engine start switch 78 shown in Fig. 6, as shown in Fig. 10, a main switch knob 278 of an electronic key system is provided. By operating the main switch knob 278, an electric circuit for operating electric lamps and an electric horn and for starting an engine and the like and a handle locking function are turned on or off. The handle locking function is a function of fixing a steering handle 2 6 at a turned state thus making the handle inoperable during parking. [0044]<br>
The main switch knob 278 takes three operation positions of 'LOCK", "OFF" and "ON" as shown in Fig. 10, and is operated to the desired operation position due to a rotational operation by the rider. Further, the main switch knob 278 is also configured to be operable by a pushing operation. When the main switch knob 278 is in a "LOCK" state, the electric circuit is interrupted, and the steering handle 26 assumes a locked state. When the main switch knob 278 assumes an OFF state, although the electric circuit is held in an interrupted state, the locking of the steering handle 26 is released and hence,<br><br>
the rider can move the vehicle by pushing. When the main switch knob 278 assumes an ON state, the interruption of the electric circuit is released and hence, the rider can start the engine E by pushing a starter switch 179 arranged on a right side of the handle. Further, in locking the vehicle, when the rider leaves the vehicle by a predetermined distance in a state that the main switch knob 27 8 is in an 'OFF" state or a "LOCK" state, the main switch knob 278 is automatically locked and a rotational operation of the main switch knob 27 8 becomes inoperable. [0045]<br>
The electronic key system is configured such that only when an ID which constitutes an electronic key stored in a remote control device 206 (see Fig. 14 and Fig. 15) carried by the rider and an ID given to the vehicle agree with each other through an electronic communication and, only when these IDs agree with each other, the rotational operation of the main switch knob 27 8 becomes possible. Due to such an electronic key system, when the rider who carries the regular remote control device 206 pushes the main switch knob 278, the ID authentication processing is performed via the remote control device 206 and, thereafter, the main switch knob 278 can be rotatably operated. Accordingly, it is unnecessary for the rider to insert a key into a key hole and hence, it is possible to obtain an advantageous effect that the locking and releasing<br><br>
operation of the vehicle can be facilitated.<br>
The main switch knob 278 is, as shown in Fig. 11, arranged close to a left side of a right opening 75b (small storing box) formed in an inner box 75 on a right side of a head pipe 27, A left opening 75a (large storing box) of the inner box 75 positioned on a left side of the head pipe 27 has a size and a capacity larger than a size and a capacity of the right opening 75b. Further, the inner box 75 is closed by a pocket cover 76 and the pocket cover 76 is locked (see Fig. 1). [0046]<br>
The sound operation device 70 is equal to the sound operation device shown in Fig. 5. As shown in Fig. 10 and Fig. 11, the sound operation device 70 is provided separately from a sound part 79 and is arranged above the sound part 79 and behind a steering stem 51 (handle steering shaft) which constitutes a boundary, that is, on a driver side. Further, the sound operation device 70 which is exposed on a surface of the vehicle body constitutes a portion of the vehicle body cover 34.<br>
In the second embodiment of the present invention, in a meter panel 173 which is arrangement adjacent to and is connected to the sound operation device 70 and constitutes a portion of the vehicle body cover 34, as shown in Fig. 10, a seat switch 281 which instructs releasing of locking of a rider's seat 31 and a box switch 282 which instructs releasing<br><br>
of locking of the inner box 75 are arranged at a position above the right side of the sound operation device 70. The seat switch 281 and the box switch 282 face an outer surface of the meter panel 173 through a hole 209 formed in the meter panel 173. [0047]<br>
As shown in Fig. 11, a steering stem 51 which is connected to the steering handle 26 (Fig. 10) is steerably supported on the head pipe 27 arranged inside the vehicle body cover 34 around the steering portion, and the sound part 79 is arranged between the meter panel 173 and an upper surface wall of the left opening 75a of the inner box 75 in the vicinity of a left side of the steering stem 51.<br>
On the other hand, a handle locking device 200 which is operated by the main switch knob 278 is arranged below the meter panel 173 and on a right side surface of the steering stem 51. The handle locking device 200 locks the handle by way of the head pipe 27 and hence, the handle locking device 200 is arranged in the vicinity of the head pipe 27. The handle locking device 200 constitutes a portion of the electronic key system, and the handle locking device 2 00 can change over the respective electric circuits and the handle locking function between an ON state and an OFF state. [0048]<br>
In the inside of the vehicle body cover 34, an antenna<br><br>
205	for transmitting ID signals to the remote control device<br>
206	(Fig. 14) carried by the rider is arranged adjacent to a right side of the handle locking device 200, and the antenna 205 is connected to the handle locking device 200,<br>
Further, an actuator 207 for releasing the locking of the rider's seat 31 and the inner box 75 is arranged in front of the antenna 205. A seat cable 212 and a box cable 213 which are described later extend from the actuator 207 , By arranging the antenna 205 and the actuator 207 in the vicinity of the handle locking device 200, a distance between the antenna 205 and the handle locking device 200, and a distance between the actuator 207 and the handle locking device 200 can be shortened and hence, the structure is advantageous for wiring. [0049]<br>
Fig. 12 is a perspective view showing the constitution of the inside of the vehicle as viewed from a rider side, and Fig. 13 is a perspective view showing the constitution of the inside of the vehicle as viewed from a front side of the vehicle.<br>
An approximately rectangular front frame 2 50 which extends in the substantially horizontal direction is mounted on a front portion of the head pipe 27. An upper frame 251 which extends in the oblique upward direction toward the rider side and a front surface frame 252 which extends in the downward direction are joined to the front frame 250. Further, a front sub frame 253 which extends toward the rider side is connected<br><br>
to a right side of the front frame 250. Aportion of the vehicle body cover 34 is supported on the upper frame 2 51 and the front surface frame 252. [0050]<br>
On the front sub frame 253, a seat switch 281, a box switch 282, the antenna 205, and the actuator 207 are mounted by way of respective stays (not shown in the drawing).<br>
Further, in the vicinity of the front frame 250, a boot 254 which stores connection terminals of various kinds of electric equipments therein, a pair of left and right headlight units 255, a bank angle sensor 256 and the like are arranged. [0051]<br>
Here, the explanation is made with respect to the handle locking device 200. Fig. 14 is a view showing the constitution of the handle locking device 200. Fig. 15 is a perspective view of the constitution around the handle locking device 200.<br>
The handle locking device 200 is, as shown in Fig. 14, constituted of a cylinder key 201 which makes the handle steering inoperable, a lock solenoid 202 which restricts the rotation of the cylinder key 201, the main switch 203 which performs a switching operation in response to the rotation of the cylinder key 201, and a control unit 204 which controls the main switch knob 278 and the electronic key system. The handle locking device 200 has many constitutional parts thereof and hence, the handle locking device 200 becomes a relatively<br><br>
large-sized part.<br>
Further, the antenna 205, the seat switch 281, the box switch 282, a receiver unit 210 which receives an ID of the remote control device 206, an actuator 207, and a controller 211 which controls ignition timing of the engine E and a fuel injection quantity are connected to the control unit 204.<br>
[0052]<br>
The control unit 2 04 performs a control such that the antenna 205 transmits an ID intrinsic to the vehicle to the remote control device 206 carried by the rider in response to an instruction from the rider. The remote control device 206 returns the received ID to a receiver unit 210 of the vehicle. Next, the control unit 204 collates the ID which the receive unit 210 receives with the ID intrinsic to the vehicle. When the authentication is finished, the locking by the electronic key system is released. To be more specific, when the rider pushes the main switch knob 278 in a state that the rider turns on the remote control device 206, the ID intrinsic to the vehicle is transmitted to the remote control device 20 6, and when the ID which the remote control device 206 returns is authenticated by the control unit 204, the locking solenoid 202 which restricts the rotation of the cylinder key 201 is operated so that the rotational operation of the main switch knob 278 becomes possible.<br>
[0053]<br><br>
As shown in Fig, 15, a seat cable 212 which is connected to a seat lock 221 for locking an open/close operation of the rider seat 31 and a box cable 213 which is connected to a box lock 222 for locking an open/close operation of the inner box 75 extend from the actuator 207. When the seat switch 281 and the box switch 282 which are arranged at a position above the right side of the sound operation device 70 are pushed, the control unit 204 of the handle locking device 200 operates the actuator 207, Accordingly, either one of the seat cable 212 and the box cable 213 which corresponds to the pushing operation is pulled and hence, the locking of the seat lock 221 or the box lock 222 is released. Further, the seat switch 281 and the box switch 282 are operable only when the main switch knob 27 8 is in a ^'LOCK" state or an "OFF" state thus preventing the erroneous release of locking of the rider seat 31 and the inner box 75 during traveling. [0054]<br>
Fig, 16 and Fig. 17 are cross-sectional views of a portion of the above-mentioned operation unit 72, Fig. 16 is a cross-sectional view taken along a line A-A in Fig. 3, and Fig. 17 is a cross-sectional view taken along a line B-B in Fig. 3.<br>
The operation unit 72 includes a lower casing 83 and an upper casing 84, and a sheet-like sealing member "91 is sandwiched between the respective casings 83, 84. On the upper<br><br>
casing 84, in addition to a volume control portion 71e which faces a rider side, the above-mentioned various kinds of operation portions 71 (see Fig. 3) are mounted in a row in the lateral direction. On the lower casing 83, a printed circuit board 80 which corresponds to the various kinds of operation portions 71 including the volume control portion 71e and to which operation signals are inputted when the volume control portion 71e or the like is operated is mounted. On the printed circuit board 80, a columnar-shape volume shaft 85 which is rotated in the circumferential direction interlockingly with the rotational operation of the volume control portion 71e is mounted by way of a holder 8 6, and the holder 86 is fixed to the printed circuit board 80 through a hole 80a from below the printed circuit board 80 using a small screw 87. [0055]<br>
To the upper casing 84, a guide 88 which extends in substantially parallel to the printed circuit board 80 is fixed. The volume shaft 85 penetrates an annular cylindrical portion 88a of the guide 88, and the volume shaft 85 is rotatably supported on the guide 88 by way of a shaft seal 89. [0056]<br>
Fig. 18 is a view showing the above-mentioned sealing member 91. Fig. 19 is a cross-sectional view of a D portion in Fig. 16 in an enlarged manner.<br>
The sealing member 91 is made of a resilient material,<br><br>
and has a profile slightly smaller than a profile of the upper casing 84 indicated by an imaginary line in Fig. 18. On a peripheral portion of the sealing member 91, a brim thick wall portion 91a having a thickness larger than thicknesses of other portions is formed along a brim of the peripheral portion. The brim thick wall portion 91a extends in the circumferential direction along an outer brim of the peripheral portion in a string manner. The brim thick wall portion 91a is, as shown in Fig. 16 and Fig. 17, interposed between respective brim portions 83a, 84a of the lower casing 83 and the upper casing 84 when the lower casing 83 and the upper casing 84 are joined to each other. [0057]<br>
In the sealing member 91, as shown in Fig. 18, an opening 91c is formed, and the above-mentioned volume shaft 85 penetrates the opening 91c (Fig. 16, Fig. 17). On a peripheral portion of the opening 91c of the sealing member 91, as shown in Fig. 16, an annular projecting portion 91b which projects toward the upper casing 8 4 is formed, and on a brim of an upper end of the projecting portion 91b, an end thick wall portion 91d having a thickness larger than thicknesses of other portions and substantially equal to the thickness of the brim thick wall portion 91a is formed. Further, as shown in Fig. 18, an annular groove 88c is formed in the guide 88 of the upper casing 84 in a state that the groove 88c faces the end thick<br><br>
wall portion 91d of the projecting portion 91b in an opposed manner. The end thick wall portion 91d of the projecting portion 91b is fitted in the annular groove 88c when the lower casing 83 and the upper casing 84 are joined to each other. Here, it is sufficient that the groove 88c is formed on a side of the upper casing 84. For example, the groove 88c may be formed in the upper casing 84 per se. [0058]<br>
Due to such a constitution, with the provision of the sealing member 91 which is interposed between the lower casing 83 and the upper casing 84, it is possible to prevent the intrusion of water or dusts into the inside of the lower casing 83. For example, even when water intrudes into the inside of the upper casing 84 through a gap formed between the vehicle body cover 34 and the volume control portion 71e, water is blocked by the brim thick wall portion 91a and the end thick wall portion 91d of the sealing member 91 and hence, the intrusion of water into the inside of the lower casing 83 can be prevented thus protecting the printed circuit board 80 arranged in the inside of the lower casing 83. [0059]<br>
The sealing member 91 is fixed in a state that the brim thick wall portion 91a is sandwiched between the outer brim portion 83a of the lower casing 83 and the outer brim portion 84a of the upper casing 84. Accordingly, when the upper casing<br><br>
84 is fastened to the lower casing 83 using small screws, the upper casing 84 is connected to the lower casing 83 in a state that the brim thick wall portion 91a is deformed by being sandwiched between the outer brim portion 83a and the outer brim portion 84a and hence, the adhesiveness of the brim thick wall portion 91a can be increased thus obtaining high sealing property.<br>
A mating surface of the lower casing 83 and the upper casing 84 is sealed by the brim thick wall portion 91a over the whole circumference thereof and hence, the sealing property of a side surface of the operation unit 72 can be ensured.<br>
Further, the outer brim portion 84a covers an outer side of the outer brim portion 83a from above and hence, water or the dusts hardly intrude into the inside of the brim thick wall portion 91a.<br>
Further, a support member 94 is mounted on the lower casing 83 in place, and the sealing member 91 is supported by the support member 94 from below. [0060]<br>
The annular end thick wall portion 91d which is mounted on the sealing member 91 in an erected manner is inserted into the annular groove 88c formed in the guide 88, and the above-mentioned casings are connected to each other in a state that the end thick wall portion 91d is deformed and hence, the adhesiveness of the end thick wall portion 91d can be increased<br><br>
thus obtaining high sealing property. In assembling the lower casing 83 and the upper casing 84, it is sufficient to insert the end thick wall portion 91d formed on the sealing member 91 into the groove 88c in an erected manner thus facilitating the assembling. [0061]<br>
In such a constitution, as shown in Fig. 18, in the sealing member 91, a distance L between the brim thick wall portion 91a and the opening 91c is,short.<br>
For example, assume a case in which the end thick wall portion 91d is not formed, a thick wall portion substantially equal to the brim thick wall portion 91a is formed on the brim portion of the opening 91c in place of the end thick wall portion 91d, a groove is formed in a side surface of a large-diametered portion 8 8b of the guide 88, and the guide 88 and the sealing member 91 are connected to each other by inserting the thick wall portion into the groove. In this case, a distance L between the brim thick wall portion 91a and the opening 91c is short and hence, it is difficult to form the thick wall portion having a length thereof sufficient for connecting the guide 88 and the sealing member 91 on the brim portion of the opening 91c.<br>
In this embodiment, the guide 88 and the sealing member 91 are connected to each other by making use of the end thick wall portion 91d mounted on the opening 91c in an erected manner<br><br>
and hence, even when the distance L between the brim thick wall portion 91a and the opening 91c is short, it is possible to ensure the end thick wall portion 91d having a sufficient length for connecting the guide 88 and the sealing member 91 whereby it is possible to connect the guide 88 and the sealing member<br>
91	with high sealing property. That is, by forming the end<br>
thick wall portion 91d on a surface of the sealing member 91<br>
in an erected manner, irrespective of a mounting position of<br>
the end thick wall portion 91d on the surface of the sealing<br>
member 91, it is possible to arrange a connection portion having<br>
sealing property at a desired position thus increasing the<br>
degree of freedom in arrangement.<br>
[0062]<br>
Fig. 20 is a cross-sectional view taken along a line C-C in Fig. 16.<br>
In an inner diameter side of the groove 88c of the guide 88, a slit 92 which is communicated with the groove 88c into which the end thick wall portion 91d is inserted is formed. A width W of the slit 92 is approximately half of the thickness of the end thick wall portion 91d. The slit 92 is provided for bleeding air when the end thick wall portion 91d is inserted into the groove 88c. In inserting the end thick wall portion 91d into the groove 88c, air is allowed to bleed from the slit<br>
92	and hence, it is possible to easily insert the end thick<br>
wall portion 91d in the groove 88c. The slit 92 is communicated<br><br>
with an inner side of the guide 88 and hence, there exists no possibility that water or the like intrudes into the inside of the operation unit 72 through the slit 92. [0063]<br>
In the second embodiment of the present invention, the handle locking device 200 and the sound part 79 are respectively arranged in a split manner such that the handle locking device 200 is arranged on one side of the steering stem 51 and the sound part 79 is arranged on another side of the steering stem 51 and hence, even when the large-sized handle locking device 200 interlocked with the electronic key system is mounted on the vehicle, the sound part 7 9 can be mounted on a side at which the handle locking device 200 is not arranged whereby it is possible to efficiently arrange the sound part 79.<br>
Further, the sound operation device 7 0 which is provided separately from the sound part 79 is arranged above the sound part 79 so as to constitute a portion of the vehicle body cover 34 at a position behind the steering stem 51 and hence, it is possible to arrange the sound operation device 70 at a position where excellent operability can be obtained without being influenced by a position of the sound part 79. Further, when the sound operation device 7 0 is formed as a body separate from the sound part 79, the sound part 79 can be miniaturized and hence, the sound part 79 can be arranged in a smaller space. [0064]<br><br>
Further, the handle locking device 200 is arranged on the side surface of the head pipe 27, and the right opening 75b of the inner box 75 is arranged in a space defined between the handle locking device 200 and the meter panel 173. On the other hand, on a side opposite to the head pipe 27, the left opening 75a of the inner box 75 which is larger than the right opening 75b is arranged below the meter panel 173, and the sound part 79 is arranged in a space surrounded by the upper surface wall of the left opening 75a and the meter panel 173 and hence, it is possible to efficiently arrange the sound part 79 by making use of the dead space surrounded by the upper surface wall of the left opening 75a and the meter panel 173.<br>
Further, the seat switch 281 and the box switch 282 which are interlocked with the electronic key system are arranged to face the outer surface of the meter panel 173 in a state that the seat switch 281 and the box switch 282 are arranged adjacent to the operation portion 71 of the sound operation device 70 and hence, and distance between the rider and the seat switch 281 and the box switch 282 is short whereby it is possible to obtain excellent operability. Further, the distance between the operation portion 71 and the seat switch 281 and the box switch 282 is short, that is, objects to be operated are arranged collectively and hence, it is possible to obtain excellent operability.<br>
nd thick wall portion 91d of the sealing<br><br>
member 91 which is connected to the groove 88c formed on the upper casing 84 side is mounted on the sealing member 91 in an erected manner and hence, it is possible to arrange the end thick wall portion 91d which constitutes a connection portion at a desired position of the sealing member 91 thus increasing the degree of freedom in the arrangement of the connection portion. [0065]<br>
Here, the above-mentioned embodiment constitutes one mode to which the present invention is applied, and the present invention is not limited to the above-mentioned embodiment. For example, although the seat switch 281 and the box switch 282 interlocked with the electronic key system are arranged to face the outer surface of the meter panel 173 in the above-mentioned embodiment, the present invention is not limited to such a constitution.   That is, switches for controlling locking of the handle or the like may be arranged to face the outer surface of the meter panel 173. Other detailed constitutions may be also arbitrarily modified.
