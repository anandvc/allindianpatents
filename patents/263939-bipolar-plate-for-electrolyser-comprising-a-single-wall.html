BIPOLAR PLATE FOR ELECTROLYSER COMPRISING A SINGLE WALL<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The electrochemical technology is at the basis of several processes of industrial<br>
relevance, such as the production of aluminium from molten salts, of copper, zinc,<br>
nickel, cobalt and lead from aqueous solutions obtained by leaching of ores, of<br>
chlorine and caustic soda from sodium chloride solutions, of chlorine and<br>
optionally hydrogen from hydrochloric acid solutions and of hydrogen and oxygen<br>
from alkaline or acidic aqueous solutions.<br>
In particular, in the case of chlorine-caustic soda electrolysis:<br>
2 NaCI + 2 H2O→Cl2 + H2 + 2 NaOH<br>
the industrial reactor known as electrolyser consists, in the technologically most<br>
advanced version of membrane electrolysis, of an assembly of elementary cells,<br>
each formed by two shells provided with perimetrical frames equipped with<br>
sealing gaskets, one membrane, two electrodes respectively known as anode and<br>
cathode secured to suitable supports and several nozzles for feeding the reactant-<br>
containing solutions and for discharging the products and the exhaust solutions.<br>
The membrane subdivides the internal volume of each elementary cell into two<br>
compartments, respectively the anodic one, containing the first of the two<br>
electrodes (anode) or current distributors (anodic) secured to the relevant<br>
supports, and the cathodic one containing the first of the two electrodes (cathode)<br>
or current distributors (cathodic) also secured to the relevant supports. Since the<br>
solutions, the reactants and the products present in the two compartments, being<br>
different (respectively sodium chloride solution and chlorine in the anodic<br>
compartment and caustic soda solution and hydrogen in the cathodic<br>
compartment) are characterised by a substantially different chemical<br>
aggressiveness, the construction materials of the two shells cannot be the same:<br>
in particular the anodic shell is built with titanium sheet and the cathodic shell with<br>
nickel sheet.<br>
When the single cells are assembled in electrical series to make up the<br>
electrolyser, the titanium anodic wall of one cell comes in contact with the nickel<br><br>
WO 2006/053768	PCT/EP2005/012381<br>
2<br>
cathodic wall of the subsequent cell.<br>
For a correct understanding of the content of the present invention, which will be<br>
illustrated in the following paragraphs, it is necessary to remind that from a<br>
constructional standpoint each elementary cell may be implemented as an<br>
independent unit consisting of a pair of shells, respectively cathodic and anodic,<br>
for instance as illustrated in DE 19816334 (constructive concept known to the<br>
experts in the field as "single cell").<br>
According to an alternative embodiment the elementary cell does not exist as<br>
independent unit, but is generated instead by the matching of suitable elements<br>
(known to the experts in the field as bipolar plates) when the electrolyser is<br>
assembled, as shown for instance in figure 3 of US 4,767,519. In the case of<br>
chlorine-caustic soda electrolysis each bipolar plate comprises an anodic shell of<br>
titanium and a cathodic shell of nickel coupled in correspondence of the walls, for<br>
example by welding. During the assemblage of a similar kind of electrolyser the<br>
bipolar plates with the membranes and the perimetrical gaskets intercalated in-<br>
between are compressed one against each other: it is in this moment that the<br>
matching of the titanium anodic shell with the nickel cathodic shell of the<br>
subsequent bipolar plate forms the elementary cells.<br>
In the case of alkaline water electrolysis:<br>
2 H2O→ 2 H2 + O2<br>
the two compartments, anodic and cathodic both contain a potassium hydroxide<br>
solution whose aggressiveness is not sensibly influenced by the presence of<br>
oxygen in the anodic compartment and of hydrogen in the cathodic one. Hence<br>
the two shells delimiting each elementary cell are usually made of the same<br>
material, nickel in particular, which is notoriously the metal characterised by best<br>
chemical resistance to alkaline solutions. This aspect has no effect at all in case<br>
the "single cell" design is adopted, while it brings to substantial constructional cost<br>
savings of the bipolar plates: in this case in fact the bipolar plate does not consist<br>
anymore of two mutually welded shells, as illustrated in the case of chlorine-<br>
caustic soda electrolysis, but rather of a single nickel sheet acting, once<br>
assembled the electrolyser, on one side as anodic wall delimiting the anodic<br><br>
WO 2006/053768	PCT/EP2005/012381<br>
3<br>
compartment of one cell and on the other side as cathodic wall delimiting the<br>
cathodic compartment of the subsequent cell (single wall hereafter).<br>
A totally equivalent situation occurs in the case of membrane water electrolysis,<br>
wherein the two solutions, anodic and cathodic, respectively consist of water and<br>
oxygen in the anodic compartment and of water and hydrogen in the cathodic<br>
compartment or, in a special process alternative, of water and oxygen in the<br>
anodic compartment and of humid hydrogen in the cathodic compartment. In both<br>
cases the construction material suited to both the anodic and cathodic conditions<br>
may be stainless steel, or preferably titanium considering its better chemical<br>
inertia.<br>
A further situation, wherein the construction material compatible with both fluids,<br>
anodic and cathodic, may be the same, is given by hydrochloric acid electrolysis<br>
in its two variants, the conventional one with chlorine and hydrogen evolution:<br>
2 HCI → H2 + Cl2<br>
or the oxygen cathode-depolarised one:<br>
4 HCI + O2 -&gt; 2 Cl2 + 2 H2O<br>
In both cases titanium and preferably some alloys thereof turn out to be<br>
compatible with the process conditions of both compartments, anodic (chlorine-<br>
containing hydrochloric acid solution) and cathodic (respectively hydrogen or<br>
oxygen with minor amounts of slightly acidic water). Thus, also in this case the<br>
bipolar plate may comprise a single sheet which during the electrolyser operation<br>
acts as anodic wall on one side and as cathodic wall on the other (see for<br>
instance US 5,770,035).<br>
A restraint to the adoption of the single wall bipolar plate design comes from the<br>
need of the two compartments, cathodic and anodic, to be provided with<br>
perimetrical flanges allowing to seal the same compartments, in co-operation with<br>
suitable gaskets, preventing the leakage of process fluids. In accordance with the<br>
known constructive procedures the perimetrical flanges are either obtained by<br>
moulding or by folding of the sheets constituting the compartment walls: in the<br>
case of bipolar plates comprising a pair of shells respectively destined to delimit<br>
an anodic compartment and a cathodic compartment, as happens in the case of<br><br>
WO 2006/053768	PCT/EP2005/012381<br>
4<br>
the chlorine-caustic soda electrolysis, each wall is processed to form only its own<br>
flange and this operation gives in general satisfying results in terms of planarity<br>
and of absence of mechanical defects. Conversely in the case of bipolar plates<br>
comprising a single wall it is necessary to proceed, operating with the known<br>
procedures, to a double forming since both flanges, cathodic and anodic, are<br>
necessarily part of the same wall. The double forming, independently from the fact<br>
that it is accomplished by moulding or by folding, introduces high mechanical<br>
stresses in the material with remarkable distortions and/or frequent mechanical<br>
defects such as tears.<br>
The problem is tackled in EP 1 366 212, where several types of perimetrical<br>
frames suitable for being used with bipolar plates comprising a single wall are<br>
described. In particular, it is proposed the use of a frame consisting of a bar or<br>
tube both with quadrangular profile, on a face of which the single wall of the<br>
bipolar element is welded, optionally in two subsequent passes in order to better<br>
ensure the absence of defects capable of releasing the process fluids to the<br>
external environment. In a further embodiment, the single wall is processed by<br>
moulding or folding so as to form a single flange, for instance the anodic flange,<br>
while the second flange, for instance the cathodic flange, is preassembled by<br>
moulding or folding of a suitable strip of identical material as that of the single<br>
wall: the preassembled cathodic flange is then secured by welding to the single<br>
wall already provided with the anodic flange. A further manufacturing alternative<br>
proposed as well in EP 1 366 212 provides that both flanges, anodic and cathodic,<br>
be preassembled in form of U-profiled frame obtained by moulding or folding of a<br>
suitable strip and that the single wall, completely planar, be secured, for instance<br>
by welding, in the middle of the frame. The problem of both manufacturing<br>
procedures is given by the need that the welds, whose linear development is<br>
remarkable, present no defect of a size such as to allow the outflow of the process<br>
fluids to the external environment. It follows that the procedure requires<br>
exasperated quality controls, moreover with the frequent intervention of the<br>
operators to eliminate the detected defects. All in all the construction turns out to<br>
be too expensive and not compatible with marketing requirements.<br><br>
WO 2006/053768	PCT/EP2005/012381<br>
5<br>
The above considered production cost aspect is further influenced by the securing<br>
procedures of the anodes and the cathodes, which comprise the production of the<br>
relevant supports and the execution of the required welds.<br>
The reduction of the latter costs was considered in WO 03/038154, which<br>
proposes to obtain the supports for the anodes and cathodes directly from the<br>
single wall through the moulding of projections, for instance of prismatic shape, on<br>
both faces. The anodes and cathodes are subsequently secured on the top of the<br>
projections, for example by welding: the above described procedure allows a<br>
saving since the support material is given by the single wall and the required<br>
welds are reduced to those for securing the anodes and the cathodes on the tops<br>
of the projections getting rid of the wall to support welds, which are needed when<br>
the supports are preassembled separately, as customary in the conventional<br>
constructions. The drawback which prevents from advantageously using the<br>
manufacturing procedure of WO 03/038154 is given by the remarkable<br>
deformation undergone by the sheet of the single wall during the moulding of the<br>
projections on both faces, with the consequence of a totally unacceptable<br>
planarity for bipolar plates which have to be assembled in a high number to form<br>
the industrial electrolysers.<br>
The survey of the prior art thus allows stating that the production of bipolar plates<br>
comprising a single wall, provided with anodic and cathodic flanges as well as of<br>
electrodes or current distributors with the relevant supports and characterised by<br>
suitable planarity and acceptable production costs on the commercial standpoint<br>
certainly represents an industrially relevant problem, with no viable solution so far.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
The present invention intends to solve the above outlined problem proposing a<br>
bipolar plate design comprising a single wall provided with flanges, anodic and<br>
cathodic, and with an anode and a cathode with the relevant supports as well as<br>
the relative manufacturing procedure characterised by a simplification both of the<br>
folding and/or moulding procedures and of the welding, and by a high quality<br>
standard as regards the planarity of the finished bipolar plate and the absence of<br>
defects capable of permitting the outflow of the process fluids to the external<br><br>

Under a first aspect, the invention consists of a bipolar plate comprising a single<br>
wall provided with anodic and cathodic flanges, wherein the flanges are formed by<br>
a preassembled frame provided with a suitable abutment surface for the single<br>
wall directed to facilitate the execution of the perimetrical fixing weld between<br>
frame and single wall.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the preassembled frame has a U-profile and<br>

of the single wall.<br>
In one alternative embodiment, the preassembled frame has a quadrangular<br>
section and is obtained by draft of a draw piece of the same material as that of the<br>
single wall.<br>
In one preferred embodiment the perimetrical welding is carried out employing the<br>
diode-laser technique.<br>
In one preferred embodiment only one of the two faces of the bipolar plate single<br>
wall is provided with longitudinal projections provided with an apex obtained by<br>
moulding, wherein said projections are aligned in parallel to one of the sides of the<br>
single wall itself.<br>
In one preferred embodiment the bipolar plate comprises a first electrode or<br>

secured to the apexes of the projections and to strip-shaped supports positioned<br>
on the face of the single wall free of projections; the strip-shaped supports are<br>
optionally positioned in the recesses of the projections with their foot in<br>
correspondence of the apex intrados.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Figure 1 sketches the type of design proposed by the prior art for the construction<br>
of a single wall-bipolar plate. In particular, the first flange (1a) is obtained by<br>
folding or moulding of the single wall (1) itself, while the second flange (2) is<br>
prepared separately as folded or moulded preassembled element making use of a<br>
suitable strip: the preassembled element is then welded to the single wall through<br>
the perimetrical weld (3) which involves the whole thickness of the two sheets (1)<br>
and (2). The so obtained frame is finally completed with a reinforcing bar (4) of<br>
metallic material, also carbon steel for instance, or of plastic material, such as for<br>
example fibreglass-reinforced vinyl polyester. The problem characterising this<br>
type of design derives from the presence of defects inside the weld (3): such<br>
defects may put in communication the two process fluids present in operation on<br>
the two sides of the bipolar plate, or one of the process fluids with the external<br>
environment. While the former type of defect is tolerable within certain limits, the<br>
latter type represents an utterly unfavourable occurrence. Of course, as known to<br>
the experts in the field, the welds may be checked according to several methods<br>
to identify the presence of defects capable of putting the interior of any chemical<br>
apparatus or part thereof in communication with the external environment. Such<br>
methods however slow down the production rates to a remarkable extent and<br>
finally determine a substantial increase in the production costs.<br>
Figures 2A, 2B and 2C sketch the solution to the problem of weld defects<br>
proposed by the present invention. In particular, the two flanges are formed by a<br>
single U-profiled frame-shaped element (5) which acts as barrier against the<br>
external environment for the process fluids, as it consists of a continuous sheet.<br>
This barrier action might be cancelled by defects contained in the weld (7) joining<br>
the frame (5) to the single wall (1): to prevent the problem, the joining weld (7) is<br>
executed by diode-laser technique. Such a procedure is characterised by the<br>
possibility of predetermining the penetration of the fusion with high precision, even<br>
in the case of the sheets making up the assembly, characterised by thicknesses<br><br>
WO 2006/053768	PCT/EP2005/012381<br>
10<br>
indicatively comprised between a few tenths of a millimetre and 2 millimetres: with<br>
a suitable adjustment, a weld bead (7) only partially penetrating the thickness of<br>
the frame sheet (5) is obtained, so that the latter is preserved as an effective<br>
barrier. Possible defects may only put in communication the process fluids<br>
present on the two sides of the bipolar plate: this presence cannot be excluded<br>
being inherent to the fusion welding process in itself, nevertheless it can be<br>
minimised by further adjusting the welding parameters so as to obtain a broad<br>
weld bead whose complete crossing by defects turns out to be substantially<br>
unlikely. In order to guarantee the preservation of these very favourable<br>
characteristics, the welding execution is facilitated by the peculiar profile of the<br>
frame (5) which in fact presents a planar abutment surface (6) directed to realise a<br>
regular contact with the peripheral edge of the single wall (1). In conclusion, the<br>
adoption of the frame design and of the welding procedures of the invention<br>
practically allows getting rid of the quality check procedures with a substantial<br>
saving in the production costs.<br>
It is to be noted that the employment of the diode laser welding technique would<br>
not be decisive in the case of the frame according to the prior art design of figure<br>
1: in fact while it is true that the welding parameters may be adjusted so as to<br>
avoid the complete fusion of the sheet (1), thereby ensuring the separation of the<br>
two process fluids present on the two sides of the single wall, it is also true that<br>
the presence of possible defects contained, as mentioned before, in the weld<br>
bead cannot be excluded. Such defects, if they are of sufficient size, would put the<br>
process fluid present on the flange (2) side in contact with the external<br>
environment. It follows that in any case, even with the adoption of a specialised<br>
welding technique such as the laser-diode one, the prior art designs, of which the<br>
one of figure 1 is an example, would anyway require the implementation of the<br>
complex and expensive quality checks.<br>
Figure 2C finally sketches a further embodiment of the invention wherein the two<br>
flanges are again integrated in a single element, which however has the shape of<br>
a closed frame (8) characterised by a quadrangular profile and including again the<br>
planar abutment surface (6). In this particular embodiment, which can be obtained<br><br>
WO 2006/053768	PCT/EP2005/012381<br>
11<br>
by continuous extrusion of quadrangular elements, the frame does not contain the<br>
reinforcing bar (4), and the required mechanical resistance to compression is<br>
ensured by a suitable thickness of the material. The hollow frame may be<br>
employed as a duct for feeding the reactants through suitable feed nozzles and<br>
suitable holes not shown in the figures.<br>
In conclusion, the frame of the invention and the welding procedure with diode-<br>
laser technique allows reducing the manufacturing costs in a significant way<br>
because the leak checks to be carried out on the finished bipolar plates are<br>
practically eliminated and nonetheless the bipolar plates assembled in the<br>
electrolysers or stacks turn out to be practically free from defects capable of<br>
putting the process fluids in communication with the external environment.<br>
To avoid cancelling the advantage deriving from the cost reduction of the frame-<br>
single wall assemblage it is necessary that also the costs of the subsequent<br>
assembling operations of the electrode supports and of the first and second<br>
electrode or current distributor be also limited.<br>
A way to obtain this result is disclosed in the previously cited patent application<br>
WO 03/038154 wherein the bipolar plate single wall is provided with projections<br>
on both sides by moulding: the projections act as supports whereon the first and<br>
second electrode or current distributor are subsequently secured. In this way only<br>
two series of welds are employed in correspondence of the apexes of the<br>
projections present on the two sides of the single wall. The procedure of WO<br>
03/038154, which also allows some advantages associated to the internal<br>
circulation of the process fluids, presents however a drawback which is difficult to<br>
overcome in the practice: the single wall, subjected to the double moulding<br>
necessary to obtain the projections on both sides, undergoes deep irreversible<br>
distortions with consequent lack of planarity and mechanical tears, which jointly<br>
cause a high percentage of rejections with a consequent critical burdening of the<br>
production costs.<br>
On the other hand as mentioned the conventional technique, sketched in figure 7<br>
of EP 1 366 212, effectively allows obtaining highly planar bipolar plates by<br>
employing strip-shaped supports whose fixing to the single wall jointly with the first<br><br>
WO 2006/053768	PCT/EP2005/012381<br>
12<br>
and second electrode or current distributor however requires carrying out four<br>
series of welds: it is clear therefore that the assembled elements are<br>
characterised by high quality but at the expense of the costs of production which<br>
undoubtedly turn out to be remarkable.<br>
The present invention achieves the scope of having bipolar plates of high planarity<br>
while keeping the production costs within reasonable and market-acceptable limits<br>
resorting to a hybridisation of the previously disclosed technologies.<br>
Figure 3 shows that the single wall (1) is provided with projections (9) on one side<br>
only: the moulding procedure is hence simplified with very reduced mechanical<br>
stresses. It follows that the deformations of the single wall after moulding are<br>
minimal and, if desired, easily eliminable by press rectification.<br>
Figures 4A and 4B sketch how the single wall (1) is then positioned on the<br>
abutment surface (6) of the perimetrical frame (5), optionally provided with a<br>
reinforcing bar (4), to be fixed by means of the weld (7).<br>
Figure 5 summarises the subsequent manufacturing step, in which the assembly<br>
of frame (5) and single wall (1) provided with projections (9) on one side only is<br>
equipped with a first electrode or current distributor (10) in contact with the apexes<br>
of the projections (9) and, on the side opposite the projections, with supports (11)<br>
in form of strips housed in the recesses of the projections: the mutual fixing of the<br>
three components (first electrode or current distributor (10), apexes of the<br>
projections (9) and supports (11)) is carried out through a single series of welds<br>
schematically indicated as (12). The best result in terms of mechanical stiffness,<br>
electric current conduction in operation and absence or in any case minimum<br>
number of defects is obtained making use of the laser welding technique for<br>
instance with a carbon dioxide-laser whose high fusion penetration allows<br>
securing the above seen components simultaneously. The supports (11) are<br>
positioned inside the projections (9) in contact with the apex intrados, which<br>
presents a planar portion to favour the contact with the foot of the same supports.<br>
The developing of the planar surface of the projection (9) apexes is limited to what<br>
required to achieve a good bearing seat for the support feet, in order to avoid that,<br>
during operation, the electrode or distributor (10) become the site for shielding<br><br>
WO 2006/053768	PCT/EP2005/012381<br>
13<br>
phenomena, which are hazardous in particular for the integrity of the ion-<br>
exchange membranes, if they are in contact with the first electrode fixed to the<br>
projections, or for the reaction gas diffusion, if gas diffusion electrodes are<br>
employed, in this case positioned on the first current distributor fixed to the<br>
projections. The supports (9) consist of sheet strips with a thickness indicatively<br>
comprised between 1 and 5 millimetres. The optimal thickness of the supports<br>
strips is the result of a compromise between the two needs of conducting the<br>
electric current in the best possible fashion (high thicknesses) and of preventing<br>
the same shielding zone-formation phenomenon seen in the case of the first<br>
electrode or current distributor, in correspondence of the junction areas with the<br>
second electrode or current distributor (low thicknesses).<br>
In figures 4 and 5 a preferred embodiment of the invention is represented,<br>
wherein the projections (9) have a prismatic shape with slightly lower length than<br>
the single wall, so as to facilitate the positioning of the supports (11) inside the<br>
same projections. It is of course also possible to produce projections consisting of<br>
aligned segments which have the merit of favouring the reaction fluid mixing in<br>
operation: in this case, the supports are fractioned as well in segments of length<br>
such that an easy housing of each segment inside each series of projections is<br>
permitted.<br>
Figure 6 shows a three-dimensional detail of the assembly of figure 5 (zone<br>
delimited by a circle) with a view from the side of the supports opposite the side<br>
wherein the first electrode or current distributor is in contact with the apexes of the<br>
projections: (4) indicates the reinforcing bar, (5) the perimetrical frame moulded in<br>
a single piece of strip, (16) the internal surface of projections (9), (11) the strip-<br>
shaped support whose foot in contact with the planar portion (13) of the projection<br>
apex is secured by the first series of welds (12).<br>
In figure 7 it is shown the completion of the element of figure 5 with the attainment<br>
of the bipolar plate in accordance with the invention: the second electrode or<br>
current distributor (14) is put in contact with the free terminal surfaces of the<br>
supports (11) and is secured by a single second series of welds (15), which may<br>
be carried out by various procedures, for instance by electrical resistance, electric<br><br>
WO 2006/053768	PCT/EP2005/012381<br>
14<br>
arc and preferably laser in consideration of the higher speed.<br>
In order that the various types of weld seen above present the required quality it is<br>
also necessary that the various components of the bipolar plate of the invention<br>
be maintained in a precise contact condition during the whole time of<br>
manufacturing. For this purpose the various components, frame and single wall<br>
during the step of execution of the fixing weld (7), first electrode or current<br>
distributor (10), single wall (1) fixed to the perimetrical frame (5) and supports (11)<br>
during the step of execution of the first single series of welds (12), and finally<br>
element obtained by means of the first single series of welds and second<br>
electrode or current distributor (14), should be accurately blocked within a suitable<br>
construction template.<br>
As regards the dimensions of the bipolar plate of the invention, the height of the<br>
projections and supports is selected in the simplest case so that the distance of<br>
the two electrodes or current distributors from the single wall surface results the<br>
same. This type of symmetrical design is employed for instance for the production<br>
of bipolar plates directed to be assembled in electrolysers for the conventional<br>
electrolysis of hydrochloric acid solutions and for the water electrolysis with<br>
potassium hydroxide solutions: in these cases the construction materials for the<br>
single wall provided with projections, for the supports and for the electrodes or<br>
current distributors are respectively titanium or alloys thereof and nickel. In both<br>
cases the solutions contain the product gases (respectively chlorine-hydrogen,<br>
and oxygen-hydrogen) as bubble dispersion: to favour the circulation of the<br>
biphasic fluids, a suitable depth of the anodic and cathodic compartments is<br>
required and therefore the projections and supports are dimensioned so as to<br>
achieve a surface distance of single wall - electrode or current distributor<br>
indicatively comprised between 30 and 50 millimetres. Optionally, one or both of<br>
the compartments, anodic and cathodic, may be equipped with devices directed to<br>
further promote the biphasic fluid circulation and to accelerate the gas bubble<br>
coalescence and the separation thereof from the liquid. Similar devices, such as<br>
channel and planar flow deflectors installed in a suitable position on one or both<br>
faces of the bipolar plate single wall, are for instance disclosed in WO 03/048420.<br><br>
WO 2006/053768	PCT/EP2005/012381<br>
15<br>
The bipolar plate of the invention can be advantageously used also for<br>
assembling electrolysers directed to the electrolysis of hydrochloric acid solutions<br>
and equipped with oxygen diffusion cathodes wherein, much as in the case of the<br>
conventional electrolysis, the construction material for the single wall provided<br>
with projections, supports and electrodes or current distributors is titanium or<br>
alloys thereof. The design can be modified in an interesting fashion: in fact if the<br>
oxygen diffusion cathode is installed on the side of the single wall provided with<br>
projections, the height of the latter is advantageously reduced since the process<br>
fluid on this side is oxygen or air which, being a gaseous phase, requires an<br>
entirely modest compartment width. It follows that the moulding operation is very<br>
simplified and that the single wall, subjected to moderate deformations, turns out<br>
being substantially planar without the need of subsequent straightening<br>
interventions. In particular, the single wall - electrode or current distributor<br>
distance is comprised between 5 and 10 millimetres. Moreover the moderate<br>
moulding stresses eliminate completely the possibility of generating those tears<br>
which are conversely a frequent event during the moulding of the projections of<br>
WO 03/038154.<br>
The other (anodic) side of the single wall is in contact with the hydrochloric acid<br>
solution containing a dispersion of chlorine bubbles: the correct circulation of this<br>
biphasic mixture requires that the compartment have an adequate depth and the<br>
supports are therefore designed with a height such that it ensures an electrode<br>
(anode) - single wall surface distance comprised between 30 and 50 millimetres<br>
as seen above.<br>
The bipolar plate of the invention is also usable for the construction of membrane<br>
fuel cell assemblies (known as stacks). Since in this kind of cells the process<br>
fluids are air on the cathode side and hydrogen or hydrogen-containing mixture on<br>
the anode side, the depth of both compartments, only crossed by gaseous<br>
phases, can be modest: it follows that the projections and likewise the supports<br>
have reduced heights (with the above seen advantages), with a single wall -<br>
electrode or current distributor distance even lower than 5 mm on both sides,<br>
anodic and cathodic.<br><br>
WO 2006/053768	PCT/EP2005/012381<br>
16<br>
In all the above disclosed applications of electrolysers or stacks comprising a<br>
multiplicity of bipolar plates of the invention a deterioration of the electrodes or<br>
current distributors, which must therefore be replaced with new components,<br>
takes place after a certain operating time. In the case of the second electrode or<br>
current distributor the replacement is carried out by eliminating the securing welds<br>
to the supports, for instance by grinding, and by welding the new replacement<br>
piece to the freed terminal surfaces of the supports. This procedure in general is<br>
to be avoided for the first electrode or current distributor since the risks of<br>
damaging the thin sheet of the projections is too high: a preferable alternative<br>
procedure provides that a new electrode or current distributor, thinner than the<br>
damaged one, be secured by welding, for instance by the cheap resistance spot-<br>
welding. The first damaged electrode or current distributor, which is then left in<br>
place, favours the homogeneous current distribution to the new thinner piece.<br>
The structure of the bipolar plate of the invention and the relevant assembly<br>
procedure of the various constituent elements justify the above given definition of<br>
hybridisation: in fact, the bipolar plate structure of the invention makes use<br>
advantageously of the projections moulded on the single wall and of the strip-<br>
shaped supports of the prior art mutually combining the same in a novel fashion.<br>
The disclosed combination allows assembling the components (first and second<br>
electrode or current distributor, single wall with projections on one side only and<br>
strip-shaped supports) with just two series of welds, obtaining the same<br>
economical advantages of the welding process of WO 03/038154, while avoiding<br>
to resort to excessively difficult moulding operations.<br>
In the descriptions contained in the present text, reference has been made to<br>
