Title A process for continuous carbonylation by supported ionic liquid-phase catalysis<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a process for continuous carbonylation of carbonylat-<br>
able reactants with carbon monoxide in the gaseous phase in the presence of a cata-<br>
lyst, wherein said catalyst is a Supported Ionic Liquid-Phase (SILP) catalyst comprising<br>
a solution of a Group VIII metal in an ionic liquid confined on a support<br>
Background Art<br>
Carbonylation of carbonylatable reactants, especially alcohols, in particular methanol,<br>
is an industrially important homogeneous catalysed batch reaction Processes for the<br>
manufacture of acetic acid from methanol by carbonylation are operated extensively<br>
throughout the world Acetic acid is used in a variety of applications, among which are<br>
in the manufacture of (poly) vinyl acetate, cellulose acetate, acetic anhydride, and ace-<br>
tyl chloride<br>
The manufacture of acetic acid from methanol and carbon monoxide at high tempera-<br>
ture and high pressure was described by BASF as early as 1913 In 1941 BASF devel-<br>
oped an improved process using Group VIII metal carbonyls as catalysts for carbonyla-<br>
tion reactions This led to the development of a high-pressure, high-temperature proc-<br>
ess (70 MPa, 250° C) with a cobalt iodide catalyst<br>
Monsanto developed a low-pressure process for the manufacture of acetic acid in the<br>
late 1960s with a rhodium iodide promoted catalyst system that demonstrated a pro-<br>
nounced higher selectivity and activity than the cobalt-based process, US patent No<br>
3,769,329 The Monsanto operating conditions in the reactor were milder (3-4 MPa and<br>
180-220°C) than in the BASF process<br>
In the early 1980s Celanese Chemical Company developed a low-reaction-water rho-<br>
dium-catalysed methanol carbonylation process using inorganic iodide salts to improve<br>
catalyst stability and activity, US patent No 5,001,259<br>
BP developed in the early 1990s a process using indium instead of rhodium in the cata-<br>
lyst system, a process known as the Cativa™ process ( Process Engineering, 1996,<br><br>
July, p21) Said process is claimed to improve catalyst stability, increase reaction<br>
rates, increase yields, and produce less liquid by-products<br>
Thomas Swan &amp; Co discloses in WO 01/07388 a continuous process for carrying out<br>
carbonylation reactions with carbon monoxide using a heterogeneous catalyst with or<br>
without use of a solvent medium, wherein at least one component is under supercritical<br>
or near cntical conditions<br>
Ionic liquids have been used as solvents for organic reactions and metal-catalysed re-<br>
actions including carbonylation reactions<br>
US 2004/0059153 (Institut Francars du Petrole) discloses a process for liquid phase<br>
carbonylation of alcohols by carbon monoxide in the presence of at least one catalyst<br>
comprising at least one rhodium and/or iridium complex and a halogenated promoter in<br>
at least one non-aqueous ionic liquid The liquid product of the process must be sepa-<br>
rated by distillation after decreasing the pressure Said decrease in pressure may<br>
cause more or less pronounced deactivation of the catalyst system used<br>
US patent No 4, 366,259 discloses a high pressure batch process for prepanng acetic<br>
acid and propronic acid and their esters by contacting a mixture of carbon monoxide<br>
and hydrogen gas with a catalyst system comprising a ruthenium-containing compound<br>
and a cobalt halide dispersed in a low melting quaternary phosphonium or ammonium<br>
base or salt The liquid product must be separated by distillation<br>
The liquid phase processes discussed above require separation of the reaction prod-<br>
ucts from the catalysts by distillation from the reactor or by flashing of the reaction solu-<br>
tion at reduced pressure Catalyst decomposition and precipitation may cause prob-<br>
lems during the flashing process wherein the liquid products from the reactor are sub-<br>
jected to a pressure decrease Furthermore these separation processes are often<br>
cumbersome, require additional reaction steps, and require the use of expensive corro-<br>
sion-resistant equipment<br>
US 2003/0212295 (Charles et al.) discloses a continuous process for the preparation of<br>
carbonylatable products wherein carbon monoxide, a reactant and a halide in the gas<br>
phase are contacted with a non-volatile catalyst solution comprising an ionic liquid and<br>
a Group VIII metal to produce a carbonylation product in the gas phase The process is<br><br>
said to be useful for the continuous preparation of acetic acid by the carbonylation of<br>
methanol The catalytically active component is incorporated in the ionic liquid, which is<br>
positioned in the reactor on a metal filter<br>
A need still exists for an improved process for the carbonylation of carbonylatable reac-<br>
tants, which provides for use of less catalyst materials, presents few requirements for<br>
the equipment used and allows a simple process design without the need for recircula-<br>
tion of and pressure change for the catalyst system<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for continuous carbonylation of carbonylat-<br>
able reactants with carbon monoxide in the gaseous phase in the presence of a cata-<br>
lyst, wherein said catalyst is a Supported Ionic Liquid-Phase (SILP) catalyst comprising<br>
a solution of a Group VIII metal in an ionic liquid confined on a support<br>
The present invention thus describes a highly efficient carbonylation process The use<br>
of a SILP catalyst provides a very large active catalyst area ensuring a very effective<br>
use of the catalyst Since the catalyst is maintained in the carbonylation reactor the<br>
process according to the invention obviates the need for subsequent separation of any<br>
catalyst under decreased pressure with the concomitant deactivation and decomposi-<br>
tion problems expenenced with pnor art carbonylation processes<br>
The present invention furthermore relates to an apparatus for carrying out the carbon-<br>
ylation process according to the invention charactensed in that it comprises<br>
i) at least one reactor 1,<br>
ii) at least one liquid evaporator 2,<br>
iii) at least one condenser 3,<br>
iv) at least one separator 4 to separate the product stream from residual process gas<br>
which is recycled to said at least one reactor<br>
Finally the present invention relates to the use of a SILP catalyst for use in the carbon-<br>
ylation process according to the invention<br><br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
The invention is explained in detail below with reference to the drawing(s), in which<br>
Fig 1 shows schematically the build-up of a SILP catalyst particle, and<br>
Fig 2 is a flow-sheet showing diagrammatically the process according to the invention<br>
Best Modes for Carrying out the Invention<br>
More particularly the present invention relates to a process for carbonylation of carbon-<br>
ylatable reactants, comprising<br>
i) continuously feeding to a reaction zone a carbonylatable reactant and carbon<br>
monoxide, wherein said carbonylatable reactant and carbon monoxide are in the<br>
gaseous phase,<br>
ii) continuously contacting said carbonylatable reactant and carbon monoxide with a<br>
SILP catalyst comprising a solution of a Group VIII metal in an ionic liquid con-<br>
fined on a support, and<br>
iii) continuously recovering from said reaction zone a gaseous effluent comprising a<br>
carbonylated product<br>
Although a carbonylation reaction may be performed simply as a reaction between a<br>
carbonylatable reactant and carbon monoxide it has been shown that an enhanced<br>
yield and selectivity may be obtained by the addition of a reaction promoter Conse-<br>
quently in a preferred embodiment of the continuous process according to the invention<br>
a reaction promoter is added to the liquid feed initially and re-circulated by the residual<br>
process gas A reaction promoter may act as a (co)-catalyst and is not consumed once<br>
steady-state conditions have been reached<br>
The Group VIII metal of the SILP catalyst used in the process according to the inven-<br>
tion may be any Group VIII metal which will react with carbon monoxide in the reaction<br>
medium to produce a metal-carbonyl complex Preferred Group VIII metals are se-<br>
lected from iron, ruthenium, rhodium, indium, nickel, cobalt, palladium or any combina-<br>
tions thereof<br><br>
Any source of catalyst precursor which will liberate the Group VIII metal by dissolution<br>
in an ionic liquid may be used as Group VIII metal catalyst precursor Examples of<br>
catalyst precursors include, without limitation, Rh(CO)2(acac), Rh(COD)(acac),<br>
[Rh(COD)CI]2, [Rh(CO)zCI]2, [Rh(CO)2l]2, [Rh(OAc)2]2, RhCI3 xH20, [lr(COD)CI]2,<br>
lr(CO)2(acac), lrCI3 x H20, Pd(OAc)2, Pd(acac)2, Co(acac)2 x H20, [Ru(COD)Cl2]x,<br>
wherein acac = acetylacetonate, OAc = acetate, and COD = 1,5-cyclooctadiene<br>
Ionic liquids are liquids composed solely of ions Ionic liquids are characterised by hav-<br>
ing a melting point below about 100 °C distinguishing ionic liquids from traditional mol-<br>
ten salts An advantage by using ionic liquids is their negligible vapour pressure below<br>
their point of decomposition This allows the separation of mixtures of ionic liquid and<br>
volatile substances, which makes them suitable as solvents for organic reactions Fur-<br>
thermore said fact means that ionic liquids are not lost by evaporation like common or-<br>
ganic solvents<br>
The physical and chemical properties of ionic liquids may be adjusted by selection of<br>
the ions of the ion pair, which again allows the designing of an ionic liquid having the<br>
properties desired Thus, the cation of an ionic liquid dictates to a large degree the<br>
melting point of said ionic liquid Generally the bigger the cation the lower the melting<br>
point Furthermore the degree of cation substitution influences the iipophilicity of an<br>
ionic liquid and thus the miscibility with an organic solvent Preferred cations of the<br>
ionic liquids used in the SILP catalysts employed in the process according to the inven-<br>
tion are quaternary nitrogen- and/or quaternary phosphorous-containing cations<br>
Particularly preferred cations of the ionic liquids are selected from the group consisting<br>
of<br>
0<br><br>
wherein R1, R2, R3, and R4 are independently selected from optionally substituted, lin-<br>

wherein R5 and R7 are independently selected from optionally substituted, linear or<br>
branched-chained C1-C2o alkyl, optionally substituted cyclic C3-C20 alky], and optionally<br>
substituted C6-C20 aryl, and<br>

chained C1-C20 alkyl, optionally substituted cyclic C3-C20 alkyl, and optionally substi-<br>
tuted C6-C2o aryl; and<br>
R11 and R12 are independently selected from hydrogen, optionally substituted, linear or<br>

substituted C6-C2o aryl, X is C, N, O, or S, n and in are each integers from 0 to 6 with<br>
the proviso that the sum 1 ^m+n 
Non-limiting examples of alkyl moreties of the substituents mentioned above include<br>
methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, iso-propyl,cyclo-propyl, n-butyl, iso-butyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, n-<br>
pentyl, n-hexyl, cyclo-hexyl.n-octyl, and iso-octyl Non-limiting examples of aryl groups<br>
include phenyl, benzyl, and ethyl-phenyl As examples of substituents of the above al-<br>
kyl and aryl groups may be mentioned, without limitation, halogen, such as fluoro,<br>
chloro, bromo or lodo, hydroxy, C1-C6 alkyl, and GrC6 alkoxy<br>
The anion of an ionic liquid is generally considered to be the ion having the most pro-<br>
found influence on the water-solubility thereof Thus a hydrophobic anion results in a<br>
poor water-solubility Likewise water is poorly soluble in an ionic liquid comprising a<br>
hydrophobic anion The viscosity of an ionic liquid depends largely on the anion, since<br>
the charge density on the anion may contribute to hydrogen bonds between the cation<br>
and the anion, the strength of hydrogen bonds being one of the significant causes of<br>
higher viscosity Preferred anions of the ionic liquids are selected from the group con-<br>
sisting of halides, nitrates, sulfates, sulfonates, sulfonyl amides, phosphates, borates,<br>
antimonates, and acetates or optionally halogen substituted hydrocarbyl derivatives<br>
thereof<br>
Examples of preferred ionic liquids for employment in the SILP catalysts for use in the<br>
process according to the invention are selected from tetrabutylphosphonium tetra-<br><br>
fluoroborate, N-butylpyridimum hexafluorophosphate, N-ethylpyndinium tetrafluorobo-<br>
rate, 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amide, 1-butyl-3-methyl-<br>
imidazolium tetrafluoroborate, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate, 1-<br>
butyI-3-methyIimidazoIium tnfluoromethylsulfonate, 1 -butyl-3-methylimidazolium<br>
bis(tnfluoromethyIsulfonyl)amide,	1 -ethyI-3~methylimidazolium<br>
bis(tnfluoromethylsulfonyl)am[de, 1-butyl-3-methyIimidazoIium acetate, 1 -butyl-3-<br>
methylimidazolium iodide, 1-ethyI-3-methylimidazoIium hydrogensulfate, 1-butyl-3-<br>
methylimidazolium methylsulfate, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium ethylsulfate, 1-butyl-3-<br>
methylimidazolium octylsulfate, 1,3-dimethylimidazolium octylsulfate, 1-butyl-3~<br>
ethylimidazolium p-toluenesulfonate, 1-ethyI-3-methylimidazoIium methanesulfonate,<br>
1,3-dimethyIimidazolium dimethylphosphate, l-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium thiocyanate,<br>
and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium dicyanamide, alone or as a mixture Particularly pre-<br>
ferred ionic liquids are 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(tnfluoromethylsulfonyl)amide, 1-<br>
butyl-3-methylimidazohum iodide, and 1-butyl -3-methylimidazolium octylsulfate<br>
Supported Ionic Liquid-Phase (SILP) catalysts comprise an ionic liquid as disclosed<br>
above having the catalytically active complex dispersed on an inert support material<br>
having a large surface area Said design allows the preparation of operationally solid<br>
catalysts which may be placed in the reactor bed while ensuring easy accessibility of<br>
the reactants to the active components of the catalyst in the ionic liquid In the present<br>
context a SILP catalyst refers to a catalyst wherein the catalytically active component is<br>
dissolved/ incorporated in the ionic liquid Ideally a SILP catalyst utilizes the advan-<br>
tages of both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis Thus the distance of diffu-<br>
sion is minimised since the ionic liquid is dispersed as a very thin film on a large sur-<br>
face area<br>
Fig 1 shows diagrammatically the exemplary design of a SILP catalyst particle,<br>
wherein an immobilised catalytic ionic liquid phase consisting of ionic liquid A+B" and a<br>
Group VIII metal represented as M+X"is dispersed at low liquid loading on a porous<br>
high-area support (By the term "low liquid loading" is meant the pore filling degree of<br>
an ionic liquid in the porous support Typically the desired liquid loading is below<br>
0 5 )Gaseous reactants diffuse into the porous structure of the SILP catalyst and reacts<br>
in the inter-phase of the thin ionic liquid catalyst film, where-after the product leaves the<br>
SILP particles again<br><br>
Suitable support materials are selected from the group consisting of silicas, polymers,<br>
zeolites, clays, alumina, titania, zirconia and combinations thereof A preferred support<br>
material is silica, since it is mechanically robust, possesses a large surface area and is<br>
easy to process to the desired particle sizes<br>
The process according to the invention may be used for the carbonylation of any car-<br>
bonylatable reactant The term "carbonylatable reactant" as used in the present context<br>
is intended to mean any organic reactant which is capable of reacting with carbon<br>
monoxide, under carbonylation conditions of temperature and pressure, to obtain a re-<br>
action product resulting from the insertion of carbon monoxide into one or more chemi-<br>
cal bonds Examples of carbonylatable compounds include alcohols, ethers, and car-<br>
boxylic acid esters having up to about 20 carbon atoms More particularly said carbon-<br>
ylatable reactants are selected from the group consisting of saturated or mono- or d1-<br>
unsaturated, linear or branched aliphatic C1-Cao reactants and saturated or mono- or d1-<br>
unsaturated aromatic reactants having from 7 to 20 carbon atoms<br>
If the desired product of the carbonylation process is an acid or a derivative thereof,<br>
such as an ester or ether thereof, preferred carbonylatable reactants are alcohols, in<br>
particular lower alcohols The most preferred alcohol is methanol, which is reacted with<br>
carbon monoxide to produce the industrially important chemical acetic acid<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the process according to the invention a reaction pro-<br>
moter is used Suitable reaction promoters are selected from the group consisting of<br>
halides, hydrogen halides, or alkyl or aryl halides having up to about 10 carbon atoms<br>
Preferred halides are selected from chlorine, bromine and iodine compounds, most<br>
preferably iodine compounds, that are gaseous under vapour phase carbonylation<br>
conditions Suitable halides include hydrogen halides such as hydrogen iodide and<br>
gaseous hydroiodic acid, alkyl and aryl halides having up to about 10 carbon atoms<br>
such as methyl iodide, ethyl iodide, methyl bromide, ethyl bromide, benzyl iodide and<br>
any mixtures thereof The halide may also be molecular halogen such as l2, Br2 or Cl2<br>
In the embodiment of the process according to the invention in which carbon monoxide<br>
is reacted with methanol to produce acetic acid, the most preferred reaction promoter is<br>
methyl iodide<br>
Scheme 1 below shows the essential steps of the catalytic cycle for the Monsanto car-<br>
bonylation process of methanol for the preparation of acetic acid Without wishing to be<br><br>
bound by any specific theory it is thought that the process according to the invention<br>
may be performed analogously for any carbonylatable reactant<br><br>
The reaction mechanism of the Monsanto process as it is believed to take place is thus<br>
as follows Methanol is first reacted with an iodide source (HI) to form methyl iodide<br>
Methyl iodide reacts with the rhodium complex by oxidative addition of methyl and io-<br>
dide to the rhodium complex under formation of an alkyl complex Said addition is fol-<br>
lowed by a migratory insertion of CO between the methyl group and the rhodium atom<br>
under formation of an unsaturated acyl complex having a free coordination site Said<br>
"free" coordination site is occupied by a new CO molecule and subsequently acetic<br>
acid iodide is separated by reductive elimination of the acyl group and one of the iodide<br>
ligands Acetic acid iodide is converted to acetic acid by reaction with water to reform<br>
the iodide source Said iodide source is by re-reaction with methanol converted to the<br>
reaction promoter methyl iodide<br>
The carbonylation reaction according to the invention may be carried out at a tempera-<br>
ture in the range from ambient to the temperature of decomposition of the ionic liquid at<br>
a pressure in the range 1-100 bar However, since the carbonylation reaction is to<br>
take place in the gaseous phase the temperature must be kept above the dew point of<br><br>
the carbonylation reaction mixture Typically the process according to the invention is<br>
carried out at a temperature in the range 100 -300° C, more preferably in the range<br>
150-230° C<br>
A wide range of pressures is available under which the carbonylation process accord-<br>
ing to the invention may be earned out provided maintenance of a gaseous state of all<br>
reactants is ensured Typically the process according to the invention is carried out at a<br>
pressure in the range 5-50 bar, more preferably in the range 10 - 30 bar<br>
The process according to the invention may be carried out in an apparatus shown dia-<br>
grammatically in Fig 2, wherein said apparatus comprises<br>
i) at least one reactor 1 ,<br>
u) at least one liquid evaporator 2,<br>
in) at least one condenser 3,<br>
iv) at least one separator 4 to separate the product stream from residual process gas<br>
which is recycled to said at least one reactor<br>
Through an evaporator inlet line 5 liquid carbonylatable reactant enters the evaporator<br>
2 In a preferred embodiment of the invention a liquid mixture of carbonylatable reac-<br>
tant and reaction promoter, at any desired ratio, such as about 20 1-1 1, preferably<br>
about 9 1-21, enters the evaporator 2 The process gas is evaporated by the evapora-<br>
tor and combined with re-circulated process gas from line 7 The reactant gas mixture<br>
enters the reactor 1 through a reactor inlet line 6 either at the bottom as shown on fig 2<br>
or at the top, if so desired The reactor 1 to be used in the process according to the in-<br>
vention may be any conventional fixed-bed or fluidised-bed reactor, wherein the SILP<br>
catalyst is present As an alternative to the above mentioned fixed-bed or fluidised-bed<br>
reactor a tube reactor may be employed A single reactor may be used, however, the<br>
use of more than one reactor, in series or parallel, is also contemplated in the present<br>
invention<br>
The reaction mixture is forced to pass the SILP catalyst, wherein the presence of the<br>
very thin film of ionic liquid containing the catalyst dispersed on a robust, inert, porous<br><br>
high-area support material 8 offers a highly efficient use of the ionic liquid catalyst<br>
phase The SILP catalyst thus requires smaller amounts of expensive metal catalyst<br>
and ionic liquid than any pnor art catalyst systems Due to the increased efficiency of<br>
the catalyst also a smaller reactor size may be used compared to prior art reaction de-<br>
signs in order to obtain similar catalyst efficiency The heat of the exothermic reaction<br>
may be removed by inter-stage cooling of a multi-bed reactor, through the fluidised bed<br>
design or as an alternative using a tube reactor with external cooling<br>
The product stream from the reactor 1 is fed to a condenser 3 through a condenser<br>
inlet line 9 either at the top as shown on fig 2 or at the bottom thereof, if so desired In<br>
the condenser 3 the gaseous reactants are evaporated from the top of the condenser 3<br>
and re-circulated via line 7 to the reactor 1 whereas the liquified reaction products are<br>
transferred to a separator 4 through a liquid reaction product line 10 In the separator 4<br>
a further separation of gaseous carbon monoxide and any other process gasses, if<br>
present, from the punfied liquid product stream is obtained The product stream from<br>
the separator 4 is processed further in a manner known per se employing e g frac-<br>
tional distillations and/or drying operations The separator 4 may be any separator<br>
known in the art, such as a common distillation unit, a flash distillation unit etc<br>
In each of the above described process steps a single unit operation device will nor-<br>
mally be used However, the invention also contemplates the use of more than one unit<br>
operation device, such as e g more than one distillation unit, if required<br>
A major advantage by the use of the above simple process design is the omission of<br>
any catalyst recirculation since the catalyst is maintained in the reactor Separation of<br>
the liquid phase currently employed in industrial plants often results in catalyst deacti-<br>
vation since carefully controlled conditions are required in order to avoid cntical low<br>
pressures in connection with flash distillation operations This also adds to a reduced<br>
demand for expensive catalyst material by the process according to the invention Fur-<br>
thermore the simplified process design provides economical benefits as a result of<br>
lower operating and running costs Existing plants may easily be adapted to the appa-<br>
ratus according to the invention or may be implemented at reduced plant investments<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The following examples illustrate the invention without limiting its scope or content<br><br>
S1LP CATALYST PREPARATION<br>
The l-bufyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide/dicarbonylduodorhodium(l) SILP catalyst em-<br>
ployed in the examples was prepared by initial stirring of a dry methanol solution (8 ml)<br>
containing 16 5 mg tetracarbonyldnododirhodium(l) (0 029 mmol) metal precursor and<br>
302 5 mg ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (1 137 mmol) under argon at-<br>
mosphere for 24 hours Subsequently, 0 600 g thermally pretreated (500 °C, 15 h, in<br>
air) silica support (silica gel 100, Merck, BET surface area 304 m2g"1&gt; pore volume<br>
1 01 cm3g"1. mean pore diameter (monomodal) 13 2 nm) was added, where after the<br>
suspension was left with slow stirring for additionally 4 hours before the volatile solvent<br>
was removed at reduced pressure at room temperature The residue consisting of fine<br>
red-brown SILP catalyst particles was then dried in a vacuum oven overnight (0 1<br>
mbar, 60 °C) and further kept in vacuo over phosphor pentaoxide prior to use<br>
CATALYTIC TEST SYSTEM<br>
Continuous, gas-phase carbonylations of methanol with carbon monoxide and methyl<br>
iodide as reaction promoter were performed in an all-heated stainless steel (AISI<br>
316Ti) catalyst test system with the SILP catalyst positioned as a fixed-bed in a tubular<br>
reactor, placed in a temperature controlled aluminum block oven The test system al-<br>
lowed the reactant feed composition to be controlled by gas- and liquid mass-flow con-<br>
trollers integrated with an evaporator and mixing unit and the reaction pressure to be<br>
controlled by a regulator valve equipped with a pneumatic actuator via connection to an<br>
electronic controller and pressure transducer Gas-phase reactants and products were<br>
analyzed continuously by an integrated on-line FID-GC using auto gas sampling<br>
Example 1<br>
1 00 g of SILP catalyst (containing 0 0437 mmol Rh metal), prepared as above, was<br>
positioned in a fixed catalyst bed in the tubular reactor where after the system was<br>
pressurized with carbon monoxide gas at a constant flow (FCo) of 50 ncm3min"1 to a<br>
constant reaction pressure (Pr) of 20 bara Meanwhile the reactor was heated to a con-<br>
stant reaction temperature (7r) of 180 °C and the rest of the test system to 160 °C<br>
When the preset reaction pressure and temperatures were reached the carbon monox-<br>
ide gas was bypassed the reactor, and a liquid mixture containing 75 25 w/w % of<br><br>
methanol methyl iodide was introduced into the bypassed reactant gas, after evapora-<br>
tion of the liquid mixture, with a constant flow (fiiq) of 0 69 gh"1 When the reactant gas<br>
mixture composition became constant, as determined by the FID-GC analysis, the<br>
methanol carbonylation reaction was started by allowing the reactant gas stream to<br>
flow through the SILP catalyst bed The carbonylation reaction was afterwards followed<br>
for 1 5 hour while determining the gas composition regularly by FID-GC analysis, allow-<br>
ing determination of methanol conversion and catalyst activity (as tum-over-frequency<br>
in mo! product formed per mol rhodium per hour) and selectivity for formation of the ob-<br>
served products acetic acid (AcOH), acetic acid methyl ester (AcOMe) and d1-<br>
methylether (MeOMe), respectively<br><br>
Example 2<br>
The results illustrated in this example are consecutive steady-state results obtained af-<br>
ter continuation of the methanol carbonylation reaction described in Example 1 at 180<br>
°C, using the 1-butyl-3-methylimidazo!ium lodide/dicarbonyldnodorhodium (I) SILP<br>
catalyst, at different reaction pressure and reactant flows, respectively<br><br><br><br><br>
