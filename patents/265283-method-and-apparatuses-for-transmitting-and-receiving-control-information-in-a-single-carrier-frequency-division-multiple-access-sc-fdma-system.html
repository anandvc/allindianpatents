METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR TRANSMITTING AND RECEIVING<br>
CONTROL INFORMATION TO RANDOMIZE INTER-CELL<br>
INTERFERENCE IN A MOBILE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
• The present invention generally relates to a mobile communication system. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method and apparatus for transmitting and receiving control information to randomize inter-cell interference caused by UpLink (UL) transmission in a future-generation multi-cell mobile communication system.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
In the field of mobile communication technologies, recent study in the area of Orthogonal,Frequency Division -Multiple Access (OFDMA) or Single Carrier-Frequency Division Multiple Access (SC-FDMA) reveals very promising for high-speed transmission on radio channels. The asynchronous cellular mobile communication standardization organization, 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is working on a future-generation mobile communication system, Long Term Evolution (LTE) in relation to the multiple access scheme.   <br>
The LTE system uses a different Transport Format (TP) for UpLink control information depending on data transmission or non-data transmission. When data and control information are transmitted simultaneously on the UL, they are multiplexed by Time Division Multiplexing (TDM). If only control information is. transmitted, ia■.particular frequency band is allocated for the control information.<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates a transmission mechanism when only control information is transmitted on the UL in a conventional LTE system. The horizontal axis represents time and the vertical axis represents frequency. One subframe 102 is^ defined in-time anda-Transmission (TX) bandwidth 120 is defined in frequency.<br><br>
Referring to FIG. 1, a basic UL time transmission unit, subframe 102 is Ims long and includes two slots 104 and 106 each 0.5ms long. Each slot 104 or 106 is comprised of a plurality of Long Blocks (LBs) 108 (or long SC-FDMA symbols) and Short Blocks (SBs) 110 (or short SC-FDMA symbols). In the illustrated case of FIG. 1, a slot is configured so as to have six LBs 108 and two SBs 110.<br>
A minimum frequency transmission unit is a frequency tone of an LB and a basic resource allocation unit is a Resource Unit (RU). RUs 112 and 114 each have a plurality of frequency tones, for example, 12 frequency tones form one RU. Frequency diversity can also be achieved by forming an RU with scattered frequency tones, instead of successive frequency tones.<br>
Since LBs 108 and SBs 110 have the same sampling rate, SBs 110 have a frequency tone size twice larger than that of LBs 108. The number of frequency tones allocated to one RU in SBs 110 is half that of frequency tones allocated to one RU in LBs ;108..Inlthe;illustrated,case.of FIG..1,-LBs 108 carry control information, while SBs 108 carry a pilot signal (or a Reference Signal (RS)). The pilot signal is a predetermined sequence by which a receiver performs channel estimation for coherent demodulation.<br>
If only control information is transmitted on the UL, it is transmitted in a predetermined frequency-band inthe LTE-system. In FIG. 1, the frequency band ■  is at least one of RUs 112 and 114 at either side ofTXbandwidth 120.<br>
In general, the frequency band carrying control information is defined in units of RUs. When a plurality of RUs is required, successive RUs are used to satisfy a single .carrier,property.,Frequency hopping can occur on a slot basis when frequency diversity for one subframe is increased .<br>
In FIG. 1, first control information (Control #1) is transmitted in RU 112 in a first slot 104 and in RU 114 in a second slot 106 by frequency hopping. Meanwhile, second control information (Control #2) is transmitted in RU 114 in first slot 104andinRU 112,insecond slot 106 by frequency hopping.<br><br>
The control information is, for example, feedback information indicating successful or failed reception of DownLink (DL) data, ACKnowledgment/Nagative ACKnowledgment (ACK/NACK) that is generally 1 bit. It is repeated in a plurality of LBs in order to increase reception performance and expand cell coverage. When 1-bit control information is transmitted from different users, Code Division Multiplexing (CDM) can be considered for multiplexing the 1-bit control information. CDM is characterized by robustness against interference, compared to Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM).<br>
A Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequence is discussed as a code sequence for CDM-. multiplexing of control information. Due to its constant envelop in time and frequency, the ZC sequence offers good Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) characteristics and excellent channel estimation performance in frequency. PAPR is the most significant consideration for UL transmission. A higher PAPR leads to a smaller cell coverage^ thereby-i increasing a signal power requirement for a User Equipment (UE). Therefore, efforts should be expanded toward PAPR reduction in UL transmission, first of all.<br>
A ZC sequence with good PAPR characteristics has a circular auto-correlation value of 0 with respect to a non-zero shift. Equation (1) below describes the ZC sequence mathematically.. .<br><br>
... .' -• .-\ hvni v;!;!iiih\ ^iihKiii.i.i ■!.■•-•..;    .-        .	■	^   '<br>
where  N   is the length of the ZC sequence,   p   is the index of the ZC<br>
sequence, and n denotes the index of a sample of the ZC sequence (n = 0,---,N-J). Because of the condition that p and M should be relatively prime numbers, the number of sequence indexes p varies with the sequence length  N. For N-6,  p = l,5. Hence, two ZC sequences are generated. If N<br>
is a prime number,  N-l, sequences are.generated.  .<br><br>
Two ZC sequences with different p values generated by equation (1) have a complex cross-correlation, of which the absolute value is  and the<br>
phase varies with p .<br>
How control information from a user is distinguished from control information from other users by a ZC sequence will be described, by way of example.<br>
Within the same cell,. 1-bit control information from different UEs is identified by time-domain cyclic shift values of a ZC sequence. The cyclic shift values are UE-specific to satisfy the condition that they are larger than the maximum transmission delay of a radio transmission path, thus ensuring mutual orthogonality among the UEs. Therefore, the number of UEs that can be accommodated for multiple accesses depends on the length of the ,ZC sequence and the cyclic shift values. For example, if the ZC sequence is 12 samples long and a minimum cyclic shift value ensuring orthogonality between ZC sequences is 2 samples, multiple accesses is available to six UEs (=12/2).<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates.a transmission mechanism in which control information from UEs is CDM-multiplexed, ■<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, first and second UEs 204 and 206 (UE #1 and UE #2) use the same ZC sequence, ZC #1 in'LBs in a cell 202 (Cell A) and cyclically shift ZC #1 by 0 208 and A 210 respectively, for user identification. In the illustrated case of FIG. 2, to expand cell coverage, UE #1 and UE #2 each generate a control..channel, signal,, by .repeating the modulation symbol of intended 1-bit UL control information six times, i.e. in six LBs and multiplying the repeated symbols by the cyclically shifted ZC sequence, ZC #1 in each LB. These control channel signals are kept orthogonal without interference between UE #1 and UE #2 in view of the circular auto-correlation property of the ZC sequence. A 210 is set to be larger than the maximum transmission delay of the radio transmission path. Two SBs in each slot carry pilots for coherent demodulation of the control information. For illustrative purposes, only one slot of the control information is shown in FIG. 2.<br><br>
In a cell 220 (Cell B), third and fourth UEs 222 and 224 (UE #3 and UE #4) use the same ZC sequence, ZC #2 in the LBs and cyclically shift ZC #2 by 0 226 and A 228 respectively, for user identification. In view of the circular auto¬correlation property of the ZC sequence, control channel signals from UE #3 and UE #4 are kept orthogonal without interference between them.<br>
This control information transmission scheme, however, causes interference between different cells as control channel signals from UEs in the cells use different ZC sequences. In FIG. 2, UE #1 and UE #2 of Cell A use different ZC sequences from those of UE #3 and UE #4 of Cell B. The cross-correlation property of the ZC sequences cause interference among the UEs in proportion to the cross-correlation between the ZC sequences. Accordingly, there exists a need for a method for reducing inter-cell interference caused by control information transmission as described above.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention provide transmission and reception operations of a UE and a Node B in the case where UL control information from a.plurality of UEs are multiplexed over a predetermined frequency area of a system ^frequency band.<br>
The present invention will be described in the context of CDM transmission of control information from a plurality of UEs in an SC-FDMA cellular communication system. Yet, the present invention is also applicable to multiplexing that does not share particular time-frequency resources, for example, FDM or TDM transmission of the1 control information. CDM can be one of various CDMA schemes including time-domain CDMA and frequency-domain CDM.<br>
For CDM, a ZC sequence is used, while any other code sequence with similar characteristics.-is:.availablec The. control information is 1-bit control information such as ACK/NACK. However, an inter-cell interference reduction method of the present invention is also applicable to control information with a plurality of bits such as a Channel Quality Indicator (CQI). In this case, each bit of the control information is transmitted in one SC-FDMA symbol. The inter-cell interference  reduction  method  is  also  applicable  to  CDM transmission  of<br><br>
different types of control information, for example, 1-bit control information and control information with a plurality of bits.<br>
Inter-cell interference occurs when UEs in adjacent cells transmit their control information using different ZC sequences of length N in M SC-FDMA symbols, i.e. M LBs being UL time transmission units.<br>
If the phases of the correlations between sequences in LBs from UEs within adjacent cells are randomized while the circular auto-correlation and cross-correlation properties of the ZC. sequence are maintained, the phase of interference between the adjacent cells is randomized across the LBs during accumulation of the LBs carrying the control information for a subframe at a receiver, thus decreasing the average interference power.<br>
In accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, each UE generates its ZC sequence on an LB basis in a subframe and applies a random sequence having a random phase or a random cyclic shift value to the ZC sequence in; each LB, .thereby: randomizing the ZC sequence. Then the UE transmits control information by the randomized ZC sequence. The random sequence is cell-specific. The interference randomization is further increased by use of a different random sequence of phase values or cyclic shift values for each UE.<br>
The present., inyentionrputs ,foruY.the.following three methods. In the following description, a ZC sequence of length N is denoted by  gp{n). The ZC<br>
sequence   gp{n)   is   randomized   over  M  LBs   and   control   information   is<br>
multiplied by the randomized ZC sequence g'^jdn) where k  denotes the index of a channel carrying the control information.<br>
Equation (2) describes the randomized ZC sequence according to Method 1.<br><br>
  	(2)<br>
where dk denotes a cyclic shift value of the same ZC sequence, by<br>
which channel k carrying the control information is identified. The cyclic shift value is preferably a time-domain cyclic shift value although it can be a frequency-domain cyclic shift value. In equation (2), mod represents modulo operation. For instance, A mod B represents the remainder of dividing A by B.<br>
SMm   is  an  orthogonal  code of length M,  being +ls  or -Is.  This<br>
orthogonal code can be a Walsh code where m denotes the index of an LB to which the control information is mapped. If the control information is repeated four times in the slots of a subframe, the chips of a Walsh sequence of length 4 are multiplied one to one by the LBs of each slot, and a combination of Walsh sequences for two slots in the subframe is different for each cell, thus randomizing inter-cell interference. For additional randomization, a different combination of Walsh sequences can be used for each UE.<br>
Equation (3) describes the randomized ZC sequence according to Method 2.<br>
  	(3)<br>
where $m  denotes a random phase value that changes the phase of the<br>
ZC sequence  gp(n) in each LB. Inter-cell interference is randomized by using<br>
different sets of random phase values, i.e. different random phase sequences y&gt;m) for adjacent cells' in LBs of a subframe.<br><br>
Equation (4) describes the randomized ZC sequence according to Method 3.<br>
  	(4)<br>
where A„, denotes a random cyclic shift value that changes the time-domain cyclic shift value dk of the ZC sequence gp(n) in each LB. Inter-cell<br>
interference is randomized by using different sets of random time-domain cyclic shift values, i.e. different random time-domain cyclic shift sequences  {A„,}  for<br>
adjacent cells in LBs of in a subframe. While the random cyclic shift values are used in the time domain herein; they can be adapted to be used in the frequency domain.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, a UE receives sequence information and random sequence information from a Node B by signaling in step 302. The sequence information is about a ZC sequence for use in transmitting control information, including the index of the ZC sequence and a cyclic shift value, and the random sequence information is used for randomizing the ZC sequence, including a random phase sequence being a set of random phase values or a random time-domain cyclic shift sequence being a set of random time-domain cyclic shift values, for application to LBs of a subframe. The signaling is upper-layer (e.g. L2) signaling or physical layer (LI) signaling. To randomize inter-cell interference, the random phase sequence or the random time-domain cyclic shift sequence is different for each.cell. For further interference randomization, the random phase sequence or the random'time-domain cyclic shift sequence can also be set to be different for each UE.<br>
In step 304, the UE generates control information and generates complex-valued modulation symbols (hereinafter, control symbols) using the control information. The number ;pf the control symbols is equal to that of LBs allocated for transmission of the control information. For example, if the control<br><br>
information is 1. bit, the UE creates as many control symbols as the number of the allocated LBs by repetition.<br>
In step 306, the UE generates the ZC sequence using the index and the cyclic shift value included in the sequence information. The UE then generates random values according to the random phase sequence or the- random time-domain cyclic shift sequence included in the random sequence information in step 308. The random values are a Walsh sequence, random phase values, or random time-domain cyclic shift values. These random values are different for each cell and/or each UE. The UE generates a randomized ZC sequence by applying the random values to the ZC sequence on an LB basis in step 310. In step 312, the UE multiplies the randomized ZC sequence by the control symbols, maps the products to the LBs, and transmits the mapped LBs.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, the Node B acquires a correlation signal by correlating a signal, received, from an intended UE in a plurality of LBs with a ZC sequence applied to the signal in step 402. In step 404, the Node B performs channel .estimation on a pilot signal received from the UE and performs channel compensation for the correlation signal using the channel estimate. The Node B acquires control information by applying random values corresponding to the UE to the channel-compensated correlation signal on an LB basis and thus removing random values from..the. channel-compensated correlation signal in step 406. The random values corresponding to the UE are known from random sequence information that the Node B transmitted to the UE.<br>
In the above transmission and reception of control information, an LB (i.e. an SC-FpMAsymbp})Jis.a.1bas]c _un.it to which the control information is mapped for transmission. The ZC sequence is repeated in units of LBs and the elements of the random phase sequence or the random time-domain cyclic shift sequence change LB by LB.<br>
In the case where a plurality of cells exist under the same Node B, UEs within each cell-multiplex-;their! control-channels using the same ZC sequence arid different time-domain cyclic shift values. If different random phase sequences or random time-domain cyclic shift sequences are used on an LB<br><br>
basis in the ceils of the Node B, orthogonality may be lost among UEs. Under this environment, therefore, a random phase sequence or a random time-domain cyclic shift sequence is specific to the Node B and the cells of the Node B use the same random sequence.<br>
Embodiment 1<br>
The first exemplary embodiment of the present invention implements Method 1 described in Equation (2).<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, the same 1-bit control information occurs 8 times in one subframe and is subject to frequency hopping on a slot basis in order to achieve frequency diversity. If two SBs and the first and last LBs carry pilots for channel estimation in each slot, the remaining LBs of the slot can be used for transmitting the control information. While one RU is used for transmitting the control information herein,.a..plurality,of RUs can be used to support a plurality of users.<br>
In a first slot, modulation symbols carrying the 1-bit control information occur four times,  for transmission  in  four LBs and  are multiplied by  an<br>
orthogonal code of length 4, (57  502 (=57.,., Sl^Sl^SJ^)) on an LB basis.<br>
SlJt represents chip x of the orthogonal code 57. The pilot sequence is also<br>
multiplied by an orthogonal code of length 4, (5/' 504 (=57'.,, 57'^ S1'J3 57'.,,,)) on an LB or SB basis. The use of orthogonal codes<br>
can increase the number of multiple-access users. For example, for length 4, four orthogonal codes are available. The use of the four orthogonal codes enable four times more users to be accommodated in the same time-frequency resources, as compared to non-use of orthogonal codes.<br>
In a second slot, the 1-bit control information occurs four times and is multiplied by an orthogonal.code of length 4, [52  506 (=S2_tl S2U S2J3 S2J4)]   .<br>
on an LB basis. The pilot sequence is also multiplied by an orthogonal code of<br><br>
length 4, (S2'  508 {=S2'4I S2'42 S2'l3 S2'44)) on an LB or SB basis.<br>
The Node B signals orthogonal codes SI 502, SI' 504, S2 506, and 52* 508 to the UE. Due to the nature of the orthogonal codes, their lengths should be multiples of 4. In FIG. 5, orthogonal codes of length 4 are applied to each slot. If frequency hopping does not take place on a slot basis in the transmission mechanism of FIG. 5, the control information may experience a negligibly small channel change in frequency during one-subframe transmission. Therefore, orthogonality is still maintained even though the length of the orthogonal codes is extended to one subframe. In this case, orthogonal codes of length 8 can be used for transmitting the control information in one subframe.<br>
A different combination of orthogonal codes to be applied to the slots of one subframe is set for each cell to randomize inter-cell interference.

Referring to FIG. 7B, control channel signal receiver 728 includes a correlator 740 and a derandomizer 742. A sequence generator 744 of correlator 740 generates a code sequence, for example, a ZC sequence used for the UE to generate 1-bit control information.

The second exemplary embodiment of the present invention implements Method 2 described in Equation (3).<br>
Referring to FIG. 8, one.slot;includes a-total of 7 LBs and the fourth LB carries a pilot signal in each slot. Hence, one sub frame has 14 LBs in total, and 2 LBs  are  used  for  pilot transmission  and   12  LBs  for control   information<br><br>
transmission. While one RU is used for transmitting control information herein, a plurality of RUs can be used to support a plurality of users.<br>
The same 1-bit control information occurs 6 times in each slot, thus 12 times in one subframe. For frequency diversity, frequency hopping is performed for the control information on a slot basis. A random phase is applied to a ZC sequence in each LB carrying the control information. The resulting randomization of the ZC sequence randomizes inter-cell interference.<br>
Random phase values applied to the ZC sequence in LBs are ^,&amp;.••*.#« 802 to 824. The ZC sequence is multiplied by  eJ*r {m = l,2,-~J2), thus being<br>
phase-rotated. As a random phase sequence, being a set of random phase values for LBs is cell-specific; hence, the inter-cell interference is randomized. That is, since the correlation between randomized ZC sequences used for LBs of different cells is randomly phase-rotated over one subframe, interference between control channels from the cells is reduced.<br>
The Node B signals the random phase sequence to the UE so that both are aware of the random phase [Sequence. .To reduce the inter-cell interference, a cell-specific random phase value can also be applied to the pilot signal. The Node B signals the random phase value to the UE so that both are aware of the random phase sequence.<br>

Hence, one-subframe has 12 LBs in total, and 4 LBs are used for pilot transmission and 12 LBs for control information transmission. The same 1-bit control information occurs 6 times in each slot, thus 12 times in one subframe. For frequency diversity, frequency hopping is performed for the control information on a slot basis.<br>

be used for LBs. A randomizer 1044 generates a random phase value for each LB and multiplies the random phase value by the ZC sequence in each LB. To do so, sequence generator 1042 receives sequence information such as a sequence length and a sequence index from controller 1010 and randomizer 1044 receives random sequence information about the random phase value for each LB from controller 1010. Then, randomizer 1044 rotates the phase of the ZC sequence by the random phase value in each LB, thus randomizing the phase of the ZC sequence.

A control information generator 1040 generates a modulation symbol having 1-bit control information and a repeater 1043 repeats the control symbol to produce as many control symbols as- the number of LBs allocated to the control information. A multiplier 1046 CDM-multiplexes the control symbols by multiplying the control symbols by the randomized ZC sequence on an LB basis, thus producing a control channel signal.<br>

data demodulator and decoder 1132. Components and an operation associated<br>
with UL data reception are well known in the art and therefore, will not be<br>
described herein.	....   .,       :i.,.<br>
Controller 1126 provides overall control to the operation of the receiver.<br><br>
It also generates control signals required for DEMUX 1124, IFFT processor 1120, demapper 1118, control channel signal receiver 1128, channel estimator 1130, and data demodulator and decoder 1132. Control signals related to UL control information and data are provided to control channel signal receiver 1128 and data demodulator and decoder 1132. A control signal indicating a sequence index indicating a pilot sequence allocated to the UE and a time-domain cyclic shift value is provided to channel estimator 1130. The sequence index and the time-domain cyclic shift value are used for pilot reception.<br>
DEMUX 1124 demultiplexes a signal received from P/S converter 1122 into a control channel signal, a data signal, and a pilot signal according to timing information received from controller 1126. Demapper ■ 1118 extracts those signals from frequency resources according to LB/SB timing information and frequency allocation information received from controller 1126.<br>
Upon receipt of a signal including control information from the UE through antenna 1110, CP remover 1112 removes a CP from the received signal. S/P converter 1114 converts the CP-free signal to parallel signals and FFT processor 1116 processes the parallel signals by FFT. After processing in demapper 1118, the FFT signals are converted to time signals in IFFT processor 1120. P/S converter.:1122:;serializes..the IFFT signals and DEMUX 1124 demultiplexes the serial signal into the control channel signal, the pilot signal, and the data signal.<br>
Channel estimator 1130 acquires a channel estimate from the pilot signal received from DEMUX 1124. Control channel signal receiver 1128 channel-compensates the; control ■..channel signal;.received, from DEMUX 1124 by the channel estimate and acquires the control information transmitted by the UE. Data demodulator and decoder 1132 channel-compensates the data signal received from DEMUX 1124 by the channel estimate and then acquires data transmitted by the UE based on the control information.<br>
When only control information1 is-transmitted without data on the UL, control channel signal receiver 1128 acquires the control information in the manner described with reference to FIGs. 8 and 9.<br><br>
Referring to FIG. 11B, control channel signal receiver 1128 includes a correlator 1140 and a derandomizer 1142. A sequence generator 1144 of correlator 1140 generates a code sequence, for example, a ZC sequence used for the UE to generate control information. To do so, sequence generator 1144 receives sequence information indicating a sequence length and a sequence index from controller 1126. The sequence information is known to both the Node B and the UE.<br>
A conjugator 1146 calculates the conjugate consequence of the ZC sequence. A multiplier 1148 CDM-demultiplexes the control channel signal received from DEMUX 1124 by multiplying the control channel signal by the conjugate sequence on an LB basis. An accumulator 1150 accumulates the product signal for the length of the ZC sequence. Multiplier 1148 of the correlator 1140 can be replaced with a phase rotator that changes the phases of<br>
the control channel signal on an LB basis according to the phase values  dk  of<br>
the sequence received from sequence generator 1144. A channel compensator 1152 channel-compensates the accumulated signal by the channel estimate received from channel estimator 1130.<br>
In derandomizer.. .1.1.42,, a: .random, value generator 1156 calculates the conjugate phase values of random phase values that the UE uses in transmitting the control information, according to random sequence information. A multiplier 1158 multiplies the channel-compensated signal by the conjugate phase values on an LB basis. Like multiplier 1046 of the transmitter, multiplier 1158 of derandomizer 1142 can be replaced with a phase rotator that changes the phases<br>
of the control channel signal Ton an LB basis according to the phase values <j>m or Am of the random sequence received from sequence generator 1156.<br>
An accumulator 1160 accumulates the signal received from multiplier 1158 for the number of LBs to which, the 1-bit control information was repeatedly mapped, thereby acquiring the 1-bit control information. The random sequence information is signaled from the Node B to the UE so that both are aware of the random sequence information.<br><br>
In a modified embodiment of the present invention, channel compensator 1152 is disposed between multiplier 1158 and accumulator 1160. While correlator 1140 and derandomizer 1142 are separately configured in FIG. I IB, sequence generator 1144 of correlator 1140. and random value generator 1 ] 56 of derandomizer 1142 can be incorporated into a single device depending on a configuration method. For example, if correlator 1140 is configured so that sequence generator 1144 generates a ZC sequence to which a random sequence is applied for each UE, multiplier 1158 and random value generator 1156 of derandomizer 1142 are not used. Thus, a device equivalent to that illustrated in FIG. 1 IB is achieved. In this case, like multiplier 1046 of the transmitter, multiplier 1148 of correlator 1140 can be replaced with a phase rotator that changes the phases of the control channel signal on a symbol basis according to<br>
the phase  values   (dk+&gt;„,)  or   (dt+Am)   of the sequence  received   from sequence generator 1144.<br>
Setting a different phase value for each LB to each UE can further increase the inter-cell interference randomization. The Node B signals the phase value of each LB to each UE.<br>
Aside from a random sequence as a phase sequence applied to 12 LBs carrying 1-bit control information, an orthogonal phase sequence such as a Fourier sequence can be used, in the second exemplary embodiment of the present invention. A Fourier sequence of length N is defined as Equation (5):<br><br>
•In Equation (5), a different cell-specific value h is set for each cell. When phase rotation is performed on an LB basis using a different Fourier sequence for each cell, there is no interference among cells if timing is synchronized among the cells.<br>
The first ,and second exemplary embodiments can be implemented in<br><br>
combination. In the transmission mechanism of FIG. 5, LBs carrying 1-bit control information are multiplied by an orthogonal code and then by a random phase sequence. As the random phase sequence is cell-specific, the inter-cell interference is reduced.<br>
Embodiment 3<br>
The third exemplary embodiment of the present invention implements Method 3 described in Equation (4).<br>
The time-domain cyclic shift value of a ZC sequence is cell-specific and changes in each LB that carries control information, thereby randomizing inter-cell interference. To be more specific, a cell-specific cyclic shift value Am applied to each LB is further applied in the time domain in addition to a cyclic<br>
shift value  dk  applied to each of .control channels that are CDM-multiplexed in<br>
the same frequency resource's within a cell. The Node B signals the cell-specific cyclic shift value to the HE. The cell-specific cyclic shift value is set to be larger than the maximum delay of a radio transmission path in order to keep the orthogonality of the ZC sequence.<br>
To reduce the inter-cell interference, a cell-specific random time-domain cyclic shift value.can.also.be.applied to the pilot signal. The Node B signals the random time-domain cyclic shift value to the UE so that the random time-domain cyclic shift sequence is known to both the Node B and the UE.<br>
Referring to FIG. 12A, one slot includes a total of 7 LBs and the fourth LB carries a pilot signal in each slot. Hence, one subframe has 14 LBs in total, and 2 LBs are used for pilot transmission and 12 LBs for control information transmission. While one RU is used for transmitting control information herein, a plurality of RUs can be used to support a plurality of users.<br>
Random time-domain cyclic shift values applied to the 12 LBs of the ZC sequence are A^A2,---,An  1202 to 1224. The ZC sequence is cyclically shifted<br>
by the random time-domain cyclic shift values 1202 to 1224 on an LB basis to randomize the control information.<br><br>
FIG. 12B is a detailed view of FIG. 12A. To CDM-multiplex different control channels within a cell, the same time-domain cyclic shift value  dk  (k<br>
is a control channel index) applies to each LB, and to randomize interference between control information from adjacent cells, different cell-specific time-domain cyclic shift-values 1202 to 1224 apply to LBs. That is, the ZC.sequence is additionally cyclically shifted by a time-domain cyclic shift value for each UE in the cell. Reference numerals 1230 and 1232 denote first and second slots, respectively in one subframe. For convenience' sake, frequency hopping is not shown.<br>
When a UE-specific time-domain cyclic shift is used for additional randomization, the time-domain cyclic shift values 1202 to 1224 indicate a UE-specific random sequence and-the combination of dk  and the time-domain<br>
"';■   -      .  -V.. :k\'  \:icyclic shift values 1202 to 1224 maintains orthogonality among the control channels within the same cell.<br>
FIG. 13 illustrates another transmission mechanism for control information according to the third exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Time-domain .cyclic; shift values of a ZC sequence for 12 LBs are Al,A2i--1An   1302 and 1324: The ZC sequence is cyclically shifted in each LB<br>
by a time-domain cyclic shift value in order to randomize control information.<br>
A transmitter and a receiver according to the third exemplary embodiment of the present invention are identical in configuration to those illustrated in FIGs. ,10A,and ,10B jand, EIGs.,..11A and 11B, except that the randomizer 1044 illustrated in FIG. 10B randomizes a ZC sequence with random time-domain cyclic shifts on an LB basis and the random value generator 1156 illustrated in FIG. 1 IB calculates the conjugate phase value of the random time-domain cyclic shift value of each LB and provides it to the multiplier 1158.<br>
The first and third exemplary &gt; embodiments can be implemented in combination. That is, in the transmission mechanism of FIG. 5, control information is multiplied by an orthogonal code, and then additionally by a<br><br>
random cyclic shift sequence on an LB basis as illustrated in Fig. 12 or Fig. 13. As the random cyclic shift sequence is different for each cell, the inter-cell interference is reduced.<br>
As is apparent from the above description, the present invention advantageously reduces inter-cell interference by applying a random phase or a cyclic shift value to each block on a cell basis or on a UE basis, when UL control information from different users is multiplexed in a future-generation multi-cell mobile communication system.<br>
While the invention has been shown and described with reference to certain exemplary embodiments of the present invention thereof, they are mere exemplary applications. For example, the exemplary embodiments of the present invention are applicable to control information with a plurality of bits such as a CQ1 as well as 1-bit control information. Also, a random value for a code sequence used for control information can be applied in a predetermined resource block basis as well as on an LB basis. Thus, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the scope of the present invention as further defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.<br><br>
