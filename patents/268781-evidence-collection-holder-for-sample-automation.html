This application further claims priority to provisional patent application Serial No. 60/567,081 filed April 30, 2004, and provisional patent application Serial No. 60/617,100 Wed October 7,2004.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The field of the present invention is devices for collecting biological samples. In particular, the several embodiments of the present invention provide a device having an absorbent for collection of oral fluids or blood specimens or cells thereon. Several embodiments of the specimen collection devices provide for recordation of identifying information and for division of the sample into separate identifiable portions to permit use of the specimen as law enforcement evidence. Generally, the embodiments of the invention further provide a holder for containing and/or securing the original specimen collection material or paper or absorbent that was used in the actual collection of the biological specimen or sample. The holder permits the original collection paper or absorbent to be processed by automated analysis equipment by securing the collection paper or absorbent in a holder that is structured to permit extraction of a test sample while maintaining the evidentiary requirements necessary for a proper chain of custody.<br>
The invention allows for collecting saliva from the mouth or blood samples from a suspect or mammal or DMA samples while later permitting extraction of portions of the sample collection absorbent for testing while maintaining the chain of evidence and identification of the specimen of saliva or blood.Background of the Invention<br>
Increasingly in law enforcement, it is necessary to collect biological samples as evidence of a crime or for use as identifying Information of a particular human as is the case of DMA collection from suspects. In the collection of biological specimens, it is necessary to associate information about the subject with the specimen at the time of collection as there is no manner for identifying a biological specimen by simple inspection. Therefore, a useful form of evidence collection device for use with biological specimens will contain, at least, a suspect information portion for recording subject information data thereon.<br>
The use of biological specimens as evidence further requires that the biological specimen be securely associated with me identifying information so as to assure that after collection of the specimen, the collection paper or absorbent cannot be intentionally or inadvertently switched to a different collection paper. At a minimum, a proper evidence collection device or holder should easily and dearly show that tampering was attempted either by damage to delicate indicia on the device or by overt damage to a strongly secured device. It is further beneficial If the evidence collection device can accommodate additional forms of evidence such as the application and storage of fingerprints on the evidence holder.<br>
A particular issue in the collection of the biological sample is that the sample collection is often taken from a living, uncooperative person. Often the sample is to be taken from the mouth of the suspect where a saliva or DNA specimen is needed. In this instance, the collection absorbent used will be attached to a handle or a stick. Once the specimen is on the absorbent, the handle is no longer needed, a present complicating factor in specimen storage and analysis due to the extra bulk and size.<br>
The foregoing issues relate, generally, to a process referred to as evidence "chain of custody." "Chain of custody" encompasses the procedures and documentation used to maintain and demonstrate the chronological history of the evidence. Documentation should include, for example, name or initials of the individual collecting the evidence, each person or entity subsequently having custody of it, dates the items were collected or transferred, agency and case number, victim's or suspect's name, and a brief description of the item. In biological samples, the principles of evidence or sample identification involved in maintaining proper "chain of custody" are especially critical as a fluid or cellular biological sample, once collected onto an absorbent, presents no distinguishing characteristics. This lack of visual characteristics<br>
foils any attempt to properly identify such a biological fluid or cellular sample once it has become separated from Its identifying information.<br>
Another problem or issue presented in the analysis of biological specimens is the need to extract or transfer the collected sample from the original collection absorbent and onto an alternate medium to permit analysis or testing of the specimen using the analysis equipment that Is available in the selected laboratory. Often it is necessary to separate the collection absorbent from its originally obtained identifying information that is directly associated with the original collection absorbent. This separation of specimen from identifying information can lead to mistakes in associating the specimen with the correct subject or suspect or can lead to the "chain of custody* being open to question in court and a failure of proof of a crime. Sample misidentification is a major source of error both in laboratory analysis and in substantiating criminal evidence.<br>
An additional issue associated with the collection of the biological sample Is the need to test or analyze the sample for comparison purposes with other specimens. The sample analysis must be conducted using preexisting instrumentation that is not amenable to maintaining the "chain of custody* of a biological specimen absorbent. For example, in automatic sample testing devices originally designed for the insurance testing industry, the standards of assuring the association of a specimen with its identifying information is not as rigorous as is required for evidence "chain of custody."<br>
Therefore, it would be a benefit if a biological sample holder and storage device were available which securely associated the biological specimen absorbent with the subject identifying information, and which permitted removal of any handle portion attached to the collection absorbent, and which was temper proof or tamper evident, and which provided ease of use for the collection law enforcement officer while in the field.<br>

Descritption of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
The purpose of the various inventive sample holders or specimen/sample carriage devices shown in the present application is to meet collection requirements that allow blood specimen collection or body fluid collection or DNA collection to qualify for secure evidence handling and for chain of custody proof requirements in law enforcement in particular, in an optimal situation, It is desirable that the sample holder used for adapting the sample or specimen collection device to an automated sampling system incorporate the original specimen collection absorbent and avoid the need for any transfer of the specimen onto a second absorbent or require the transfer of a bar code or other identifying material from the collection absorbent or DNA collector or sampling device onto the sample device holder. It is far more desirable and preferable that the original specimen collection absorbent and the same bar code that is attached to the original sample or specimen collection absorbent or device be inserted into the sample holder and be viewable from within the sample or specimen holder. It also Is important that the absorbent or sampling paper surface, while held within the holder, be exposed so that small portions or circles can be punched from the paper for delivery into testing vials for making the DNA determination.<br>
It is also another important feature that the sample holder have a locking feature so that once the sample collection device and/or absorbent is fixed within the holder, it is locked into the holder, and the holder cannot be tampered with or opened without the damage being evident. It is another benefit if the holder for such automated sampling avoids a secondary transfer of (he original collection absorbent 110 (Fig. 10) of collector or collection device 106 (Fig. 10) or any destruction of the original sample device 106 and/or collection absorbent 110 and maintains the original collection absorbent 110 (Fig. 10) attached or within its handle and bearing its original bar code marking and other identifying markings. This is desirable to eliminate any mix up between samples due to transfer of the original identifiers associated with the sample during the moment of sample collection onto sample holders used during analysis of the sample. It is another important benefit that separation of the sample from the handle or transfer of bar codes or other identity material be avoided. This is desirable to avoid complication of the chain of custody and to make an unambiguous association between the device that received the subject's blood specimen or went Into the subject's mouth to collect the sample and the sample that appears In the laboratory for analysis.<br>
Referring now to Figs. 1-43, a sample carriage device embodiment 10 is shown which allows the paper absorbent 110 of the specimen/sample collector 106 to be<br>
Inserted into the damage device 10 and the paper absorbent 110 captured within the carriage device and the paper separated from the coitector handle 114 (Fig. 10) by serrated edges 21 on device 10.<br>
Referring to Fig, 1, embodiment 10 is comprised of an upper portion 12 that is connected to a bottom portion 14 by the use of a hinge means or staple connection or fold along back edge 16 to permit top portion 12 to be separable from bottom portion 14 along front edge 18  Front edge 18 includes cutter portion 21 having teeth-like edges or serrations in front edge 18 the purpose of which shall be described hereinafter.<br>
In operation, a specimen or sample collector 106 such as the one shown in Figures 8 -10 can be used with any of the embodiments of Figs. 1-7. Other configurations or shapes of absorbents 110 may be used if the registration track or groove 22 of the sample carriage 10 is reconfigured to accept the alternate absorbent shape. The sample carriage 10 shown in Figs. 1-3 may be operated by removing the handle portion 106 from holder 108 (Fig 10) and inserting collection absorbent or paper 110, having a specimen or sampler thereon, into device 10 such that absorbent or paper 110 is visible within viewing or sample collection area or window 24.<br>
Once the collection paper 110 is positioned so as to be captured within the registration track or groove 22 of holder 10, top portion 12 is pressed against bottom portion 14 to secure absorbent 110 therebetween. Top portion 12 and bottom portion 14 are then held together by a securing means. In device 10, top portion 12 and bottom portion 14 are held together by a frictional fit between top portion 12 and bottom portion 14 as top portion 12 fits into a recessed area 28 of bottom portion 14. Alternatively, or additionally, the securing means may be a post 32 insertable into a detent 34 to lock together top portion 12 and bottom portion 14 as is shown in Figs 4-5 for embodiment 30 (Fig. 4). Alternative securing means wfll be apparent to those skilled in the art, means such as glue or tape or a staple or adhesive strip or a peel and stick or release liner or any convenient means of securing the two surfaces together to hold collection absorbent paper 110 within top portion 12 and bottom portion 14 also may be used. When absorbent paper 110 is secured within the holder 10, serration or cutter 21 may be used to separate the paper 110 from handle portion 106 by using the cutter 21 to separate handle 106 from absorbent 110. This then will present sample absorbent paper 110 locked into the device 10 as is shown in Fig. 3 wherein absorbent sample paper 110 is shown by the Crosshatch marks within the window 24 and with the paper now bearing reference numeral 110 to indicate that it Is the absorbent sample paper 110 taken from the holder 106.<br>
Once sample paper 110 is fixed within the holder 10, the paper may then be loaded into an automated sampling device such as an automated sample-punching machine such as a BSD-1000 manufactured in Australia, The automated sampling device will read bar code 26 on top surface 12 of device 10. A typical automated sampling device will then punch samples from collection paper 110 as it is held within window 24 of holder 10. It will be appreciated that bar code 26 is bar code 152b shown on collection device 106 in Fig. 10 and which has been transferred to the holder 10 during the process of capturing collection absorbent paper 110 within holder 10. Alternatively, a duplicate version of bar code 152b may be produced and placed on device 10 to serve as bar code 26.<br>
Referring now to Figs. 4 and 5, another embodiment, device 40, is shown which is similar in construction to device 10 of Figs. 1-3. In describing device 40, the same reference numbers will be used in describing structures that are similar to structures found in device 10. Device or sample holder 40 is comprised of a top or upper portion 12 that is separate from bottom portion 14. As upper or top portion 12 is fully separable from bottom portion 14, a securing means is provided to connect upper portion 12 to bottom portion 14 alter absorbent 110 has been inserted into registration track or groove 22 of bottom portion 14 In the embodiment 'of device 40, the securing means is post 32 which is inserted into void or detent 34 and which is captured therein. Device 40 also includes a cutter portion 21 with teeth-like edges or serrations that serve to allow the user of device 40 to tear absorbent 110 from handle 114 of collector 106 when absorbent 110 has been captured between upper or top portion 12 and bottom portion 14.<br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that devices 10 and 40 may involve the transfer of the identifying barcode 152b from the handle 106 of the collection device of Fig. 10 to sample holder 10 to provide the bar code shown in the position of bar code 26. However, it is possible to provide sample holder 10,40 as a unit that includes a specimen collector such as collector 106, both of which devices are pre-provfded with matching bar codes 26.<br>
It also should be appreciated that the embodiments shown in Figs. 1-5 involve modification of the structure of the device used to collect the sample. Specifically, the handle 114 is separated from paper 110 upon which the sample resides. While the embodiments of Figs, 1-5 do not contain all file preferred features of a preferred embodiment, they will be functional for some purposes in which a chain of custody or evidentiary issues are not as strict as within criminal chain of custody matters.<br>
The embodment in Figs. 6 and 7, now to be described, provides all the preferred objects. Referring now to Figs. 6-7, a specimen holder 50 is shown in which the entire collection handle 114 and collection paper 110 of collection device 106 (Fig. 10) is inserted into the holder 50. Holder 50 is comprised of an upper portion 12 and a bottom portion 14 which can be superimposed on one another and pressed together to interconnect to capture device 108 (Fig. 12) within registration groove 22 of holder 50. Top portion 12 and bottom portion 14 are held together, as described for the embodiments of Fig. 1-5, by any useful means of securing the top portion 12 to the bottom portion 14. Such means may be adhesive tape, staples, ultrasonic fusing of the material together if the holder were plastic, or an arrangement of locking posts and detents can be utilized such as Is shown in Figs. 6-7. In the embodiment of Figs. 6 &amp; 7, posts 32 are registerable and insertably lockable into detents 34. It also will be appreciated that the handie 114 can be shortened, if necessary, to fit into the device by cutting the handle 114 or providing a perforation line that allows breaking handle 114 to shorten it to a length compatible with holder 50.<br>
In operation, the function of the embodiment 50 of Figs. 6 &amp; 7 is as follows: A handle sample holder 106 having a bar code 152b and having a collection absorbent or paper 110 attached thereto such as the collection device 106 of Figs. 8-10 of the present application is inserted into bottom portion or half 14 of device 50. As is shown in Fig. 6, windows 52a, b and 54a, b are included on both top portion 12 and bottom portion 14 of holder 50, A support band 56 bridges windows 52a, b and S4a, b. Support band 56 supports device 106 within the holder 50 while allowing the bar code 152b on device 106 to be viewed and read with a bar code scanner and sample collection portion 110 of device 106 to be exposed and accessible and viewable at all times.<br>
It will be appreciated that during manufacture, bottom portion 12 and top portion 14 of device 50 can be constructed so the top and bottom portions are identical. Thus, the individual Inserting device 106 into the halves of the device need not select and match a top portion and a bottom portion. This can be achieved by simply manipulating the closure method so the top 12 and bottom 14 can be the same. In the case of the posts and detents, it would be possible to put alt the posts on either the top or the bottom or on one edge of the device, so identical tops and bottoms could be constructed.<br>
In operation, after device 106 has been inserted into holder 50 and top portion 12 connected to bottom portion 14, the resulting assembly Is as shown in Fig. 7. In Fig.7.device 106 is locked within  the compressed togetner.top and bottom halves 12,14 of device SO and bar code 152b of device 106 is visible within window 52a and collection paper 110 is visible and accessible through window 54a, b. It will be appreciated that as window 54a is aligned with window 54b, a portion of collection absorbent 110 may be removed by use of a punch to extract a sample of collection paper or absorbent 110 for testing. In addition, it will be appreciated that the original bar code attached to sample collection device 106 is still attached to device 106 and is visible through window 52a of device 50. Further, if additional or alternate bar code or Identification symbols are needed, they may be placed on device 50 as is shown by bar code label 26<br>
Referring now to Fig, 11, yet another embodiment of the holder, holder 60, will be discussed. Holder 60 is comprised of a holder bottom or body portion 14 to which is attached a foldable, closeable top portion or hood portion 12 and which is attached to body portion 14 at hinged edge 16. Attachment point or edge 16 can be any flexible hinge type of connection between body 14 and hood 12 that permits hingeabie opening of portion 12 with respect to body 14. Alternatively, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that portion 12 could be a separate cover from body portion 14, and the two portions 12 and 14 made connectable by interlocking weld means or post and detent means or other connection means as previously described for the devices shown in Figs. 1 -7. Again, the object is to contain a collection device 106 within holder 60 while presenting the identifying barcode 152b and the sample collection paper or portion 110 visible and available for reading and for the punching of sample disks from collection paper 110,<br>
In operation, device 60 of Fig. 11 is used as follows. A collection sample device such as device 106 of Figs. 8 -10 is placed on bottom portion 14 so that absorbent 110 covers window 24 on bottom 14 and handle 114 of device 106 is generally flush with the surface of bottom portion 14. Window 24 permits collection paper 110 to be viewed and paper disks to be punched from collection paper 110 when device 106 is mounted within holder 60. It will be appreciated that window 24 of top portion 12 of the device 60 has a simitar window portion 24 directly opposite and in registration with the window of top 12 and which is in base portion 14. This alignment of windows 24 permits a paper disk to be punched from collection paper 110 as absorbent paper 110 is held within device 60.

Moreover, the description and illustration of the inventions is by way of example, and the scope of the inventions is not limited to the exact details shown or described.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 33, an alternate embodiment of the device shown in Figs 25 and 26 is shown. In the embodiment of Fig. 33, two sample storage portions 760 are shown. The dual sample storage portions allow the collection agency to collect two<br>
different specimens (e.g saliva  and blood) from the same subject or duplicate samples (e.g., two saliva samples) from the same subject As in the devices of Figs. 25 and 26, the specimen absorbent is secured onto portion 760 by application of an adhesive-backed cover paper 661 as previously described.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 32, yet another alternate embodiment 910 is shown in which top layer 912 is shown in a peeled-up position to allow insertion of a collection absorbent 106 therein. Once the absorbent having the sample thereon has been inserted into the device, the top layer can be pressed against bottom layer 914 to capture the collection absorbent therebetween. In one embodiment, a releasable adhesive is used to secure top layer 912 to bottom layer 914. Alternatively, a release tiner (not shown) can be used to cover a permanent adhesive on bottom layer 914 until it is desired to secure top layer 912 to bottom layer 914 at which time the release liner can be removed to expose the adhesive. The use of a release liner is preferred in situations in which it is desired to permanently secure the collection absorbent into the device 910 and to reveal any attempt to re-open the device to tamper with the absorbent once it is placed into the device.<br>
First referring to Fig. 38, an embodiment of the present invention is shown in exploded view so each component comprising the device may be more easily described. DNA collection device 1200 comprises holder or holder portion 1202 having cavity 1204. Cavity 1204 is configured to accommodate handle 1216 and to allow support of DNA collection absorbent 1208 on absorbent support area 1203 at front end 1214 of holder 1202. Sliding cover 1210 is operably joined to handle 1216 to permit sliding cover 1210 to be moved over absorbent 1208 to protect absorbent 1208 and to be retracted to expose absorbent 1208. Handle 1216 comprises lower handle portion 1206b and upper handle portion 1206a having DNA absorbent 1208 captured therebetween. Hereinafter, this unit of lower handle portion 1206b, upper handle portion 1206a and absorbent 1208 will be referred to as handle 1216.<br>
Holder 1202, in a preferred embodiment, Is configured so handle 1216 may be inserted into cavity 1204 of holder 1202 from rear end 1212 of holder 1202. Once handle 1216 is entered into holder 1202 from rear end 1212, handle 1216 then may be pressed forwardly toward front end 1214 of holder 1202 to permit absorbent 1208 to rest upon and be supported by absorbent support area 1203, As handle 1216 is inserted from rear edge 1212, and as it is pressed forwardly towards front edge 1214, outside edges 1220a,b (Fig. 36) of handle 1216 are pressed underneath and frictionally captured by retaining flanges 1218a, 1218b of holder 1202. The forward movement of<br>
handle 1216 within holder1202 is ended when side stop 1222a,b and bottom stop 1224 protruding from lower handle portion 1206b contact rear end 1212 of holder 1202. The frictional capture of handle 1216 by flanges 1218a, 1218b firmly retains handle 1216 within holder 1202 and positions and retains absorbent 1208 on area 1203 of front end 1214 of holder 1202 during the collection of DNA samples. It will be appreciated, as will be described hereinafter, that the secure retention of handle 1216 on holder 1202 permits the ease of sliding movement of slidable cover 1210 during the operation of the ONA collection device 1200.<br>
The utility and operation of DNA collection device 1200 now will be described with reference to Figs. 34 - 38. In general, DNA collection device 1200 is provided In two operational forms, the first being shown in Figs. 34-35 wherein handle 1216, having slidable cover 1210 attached thereto, is mounted in holder 1202. It is in this configuration that absorbent 1208 is resting on absorbent support area 1203 on front end 1214 of holder 1202 to thereby provide support and reinforcement of absorbent 1208 as it is used for the collection of DNA samples from a subject. As described hereinafter, the configuration of Figs. 34 - 35, wherein holder 1202 support handle 1216, provides for support of absorbent 1208 during collection procedures and allows for the covering and protection of both top and bottom surfaces of absorbent 1208 during precoltection, collection, and post-collection procedures. This configuration also allows for moisture to evaporate from absorbent 1208 when the DNA collection procedure has involved a liquid or wet sample.<br>
The second general operational form of device 1200 is shown in Figs. 36 and 37 wherein holder 1202 has been removed from handle 1216 leaving slidabie cover 1210 attached to handle 1216. In this configuration, device 1200 is most conveniently used within the laboratory for manipulation of the handle 1216 during the removal of portions of absorbent 1208 for the performance of clinical testing on any sample collected on absorbent 1208. The use and operation of device 1200 while In the configuration shown in Figs. 36 and 37 will be described in detail hereinafter.<br>
Again referring to Figs. 34 and 35, the operation of device 1200 with handle 1216 contained in holder 1202 will be described. The configuration of device 1200 as shown in Figs. 34 and 35 is primarily intended for shipping of the device to the field officer or station where a DNA sample will be collected, for actual use of the device during the collection of the DNA sample and then for a return shipment gf the device to a clinical laboratory for analysis. Device 1200 is particularly suited to these operations as in Figs. 34 and 35, it can be seen that handle 1216 is contained completely within<br>
holder 1202 and is provided with siidabfe cover 1210 mounted atop handle 1216 as shown and described in Fig. 38. A comparison of Fig. 34 with Fig, 35 shows that in Fig. 34, slidable cover 1210 is poditioned or pushed rearwardly to expose absorbent 1208 to view and to use, whereas in Fig. 35, sifdabte cover 1210 is pushed or pressed forwardly so absorbent 1208 is hidden from view by slidaWe cover 1210.  Absorbent 1208 is protected from any unintentional and undesired contact with the surroundings by slidable cover 1210 protecting the top surface of absorbent 1208 and holder 1202 protecting the bottom surface of absorbent 1208. it will be appreciated that during shipping procedures and during operations prior to and after the collection of the DNA specimen, that device 1200 wilt have slidable cover 1210 pressed forwardiy as shown in Fig. 35 to protect absorbent 1208 from any extraneous DNA collection or from incidental damage during transporter manipulation preparatory to use or after use. Such extraneous DMA might be contributed to absorbent 1208 by the incidental brushing of absorbent 1208 on ttie body of the officer making the sample collection, or on alternate areas of mammalian remains that contain DNA, but which were not the intended area of collection for that sample.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 34, device 1200 is shown with slidable cover 1210 pushed rearwardly to expose absorbent 1208 and to allow collection of a DNA specimen thereon, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that with handle 1216 mounted within holder 1202 and slidable cover 1210 withdrawn rearwardly to expose absorbent 1208, that absorbent 1208 has only a single surface exposed for collection of DNA thereon. Also, it will be appreciated that absorbent 1208 is resting upon area 1203 of holder 1202 so that absorbent 1208 is supported by area 1203 during collection activities. Due to the support of absorbent 1208 by support area 1203 during collection activities, absorbent 1208 may be relatively roughly treated during the collection of a DNA specimen without undue harm to absorbent 1208.<br>
For example, when collecting a blood specimen from the ground or a roughened surface, the support of absorbent 1208 by support area 1203 allows pressure to be exerted against absorbent 1208 to achieve collection of the dried blood or liquid blood from a rough surface without having to apply support pressure to the back of absorbent 1208. In such a case, the operator might be Inclined to touch absorbent 1208 with their finger or other object to exert pressure on absorbent 1208 that might risk contamination of absorbent 1208 through the addition of extraneous DNA or other substances to absorbent 1208- Further, it will be appreciated that if a pool of liquid is presented, the option exists to simply remove handle 1216, having absorbent 1208 attached thereto,<br>
from capture with in holder  1202 to thereby allow dipping of absorbent 1208 into a liquid specimen- This removal of handle 1216 from holder 1202 would be followed by reinsertion of handle 1216 Into holder 1202 for transport of the now collected DNA specimen to a clinical laboratory for analysis. Those skilled in the art win appreciate that once the DMA specimen has been collected on absorbent 1208, slidable cover 1210 is moved forwardly to cover absorbent 1208. This covering of the top surface of absorbent 1208 by slidable cover 1210 and the covering of bottom surface of absorbent 1208 by support area 1203 of holder 1202 provides protection of absorbent 1208 from further contact with extraneous matter while allowing air to circulate across the sides and upper face of absorbent 1208 to allow evaporation of any liquid collected on absorbent 1208 and drying of the collected specimen to help avoid spoilage of the collected biological specimen.<br>
Examination of Figs. 34 and 35 also will show that slidable cover 1210 is closely fit between the vertical sides of flanges 1218a, 1218b to provide frictional resistance to the movement of siidable cover 1210 on handle 1216 when handle 1216 is contained within holder 1202. In this manner, factional resistance is provided to the sliding back and forth slidable cover 1210 thereby assisting in the retention of slidable cover 1210 in any position selected by an operator using device 1200 as shown in Figs. 34 and 35.<br>
Referring now to Rgs. 36 and 37, the operation of device 1200 in the configuration in which holder 1202 has been removed will be described. While the configuration of device 1200 is shown in Figs, 36 - 37, may be used during the collection of a bioiogica! sample in those cases when the attachment of holder 1202 might interfere with the sample collection or make the sample collection more difficult, the configuration shown in Figs. 36 - 37 generally is used within the clinical laboratory. When a biological specimen or sample has been collected on absorbent 1208, and the entire device shown in Figs. 34 - 35 has been shipped to a clinical laboratory for testing of the specimen, it is necessary that portions of absorbent 1208 be removed or punched from absorbent 1208. The removal of portions of absorbent 1208 allows a clinical analysis to be performed on those portions removed from absorbent 1208 while retaining a portion of the biological sample on absorbent 1208 as a continuing historical and evidentiary record. When it is desired to remove a portion of absorbent 1208 for clinical testing, handle 1216 is removed from holder 1202 and sliding cover 1210 is pushed rearwardly to expose absorbent 1208 and removal of portions of 1208 can be affected by punching or cutting of a portion of the absorbent from absorbent 1208.<br>
Examination of Flg 38 shows that slldable cover 1210 is provided with track followers 1226a,b which move fbrwardly and rearwardly within tracks 1228a,b of handle 1206a,b. Track followers 1226a,b are closely fit within tracks 1228a,b of handle 1206a,b and provide frictlonal resistance to the movement of slidabte cover 1210 along tracks 1228a,b. in this manner, frictional resistance is provided to the sliding back and forth slidable cover 1210 when handle 1216 is removed from holder 1202 thereby assisting In the retention of slldable cover 1210 in any position selected by an operator using device 1200 as shown in Figs. 36 and 37.<br>
