				<td>METHODS AND APPARATUS FOR THE COOLING OF FILAMENTS<br>
IN A FILAMENT FORMING PROCESS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD AND INDUSTRIAL<br>
APPLICABILITY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to the cooling of filaments in a filament forming process,<br>
and in particular, to methods and apparatus for the cooling of filaments in a filament<br>
forming process. The invention is useful in the production of continuous glass filaments<br>
for use in a wide range of applications including textiles and reinforcements.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A strand of glass filaments is typically formed by attenuating molten glass through<br>
a plurality of orifices in a bottom plate of a bushing. The filaments are attenuated by<br>
applying tractive forces to the streams of glass, so as to attenuate the streams from the<br>
orifices in the bottom plate. The filaments pass into contact with pre-pad sprays and<br>
thereafter, are coated with a size or binder material. The size or binder material serves to<br>
provide a lubricating quality to the individual filaments to provide them with abrasion<br>
resistance or to impart a desired array of properties to the strand in its ultimate application.<br>
The size material is applied after the filaments are formed. The filaments are gathered in<br>
parallel relationship to form a strand.<br>
The condition of the filaments prior to the application of the size material affects<br>
the efficiency and quality of the size application process. In conventional filament<br>
forming operations, solid or sticky sizing particles form at the points where the filaments<br>
contact the sizing film on the surface of a size applicator. The formation of these sizing<br>
particles is referred to as "plate out." A leading cause of "plate out" is a high filament<br>
temperature at the point of contact on the size applicator.<br>
"Plate out" that is not quickly remedied can lead to filament breaks, process<br>
interruptions, and lower glass filament forming efficiency. Accordingly, the size<br>
application process is affected by the temperature of the filaments as they contact the size<br>
applicator.<br>
In addition to the temperature of the filaments at the size applicator, the size<br>
application process is affected by the moisture conditions of the filaments. Since many<br>
types of size material have some moisture content, the amount of moisture on the<br>
filaments determines how much size material is applied to and retained on the filaments.<br>
High moisture content on the filaments upstream of the size applicator reduces the<br>
efficiency of the application of the size material. Too much moisture tends to dilute the<br>
size material picked up by the filaments. It also requires the size material on the size<br>
applicator to be constantly replenished, since the size application utilizes a closed system.<br>
A high moisture content on the filaments also promotes migration-induced wastes.<br>
If there is too much moisture on the filaments, the size material will migrate along the<br>
filaments as the filaments are wound on a collet. As the filaments are wound, migration of<br>
the size material results in a higher concentration of the material at the ends of the<br>
package, thereby reducing the quality of the final product.<br>
One proposed solution to the above problems is to coat the filaments with a pre-<br>
pad spray upstream of the size applicator. The pre-pad spray is usually applied by a pre-<br>
pad system that uses a nozzle. The pre-pad sprays serve multiple functions, including<br>
cooling the filaments and lubricating the filaments. Since too much moisture adversely<br>
affects the forming process, one solution is to use less pre-pad water. However, less pre-<br>
pad water with conventional systems results in less efficient cooling and higher filament<br>
temperatures.<br>
Another proposed solution is to use air instead of applying pre-pad sprays of water.<br>
While using air instead of water as a pre-pad spray reduces the amount of moisture to be<br>
dried from the collected strand, the filaments are insufficiently cooled to reduce the<br>
likelihood of "plate out."<br>
A need exists for an apparatus for cooling glass filaments in a filament forming<br>
process that results in an improved temperature uniformity among filaments. Similarly, a<br>
need exists for an efficient filament forming method that maintains low forming moisture<br>
conditions and improves the application of size material on the filaments.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The shortcomings of the prior art are overcome by the disclosed cooling systems<br>
and the methods of cooling filaments using the cooling systems. One embodiment of the<br>
cooling system includes one or more nozzles that direct a flow of air on the filaments<br>
above a pre-pad water spray. Alternatively, another cooling system utilizes air-atomizing<br>
nozzles to spray a mixture of air and water on the filaments.<br>
The cooling systems provide an improved distribution of cooling fluid particles to<br>
enhance the cooling of the filaments. The sprays from the nozzles have a higher<br>
momentum and are able to penetrate deeper into a filament fan than conventional cooling<br>
systems. The results are an improved temperature uniformity among the filaments and an<br>
overall reduction in temperature of the filaments prior to the application of size material.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION AND PREFERRED<br>
EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
A strand is typically formed from a group of filaments or fibers that are attenuated<br>
from a source of fiber-forming material. For glass strands, molten glass is delivered to a<br>
bushing that is electrically heated to maintain the glass in a molten state. The glass is<br>
pulled or attenuated as filaments from orifices in a bottom plate of the bushing.<br>
The current trend is to operate bushings at higher temperatures and higher<br>
throughputs. While the goal is to produce more glass, these conditions result in<br>
undesirable side effects at the size applicator, such as filament breaks and process<br>
interruptions. Higher filament temperatures also increase the likelihood of degradation of<br>
material.<br>
Conventional filament forming systems utilize pre-pad water sprays to cool<br>
filaments and provide lubrication to reduce contact point breaks. Since filaments tend to<br>
bundle together at the size applicator contact location, pre-pad sprays are used to enhance<br>
uniform lubrication.<br>
The cooling system of the present invention utilizes less water to cool filaments<br>
than conventional pre-pad systems. Accordingly, less water is needed to cool the<br>
filaments to a particular temperature upstream of a size applicator. The result is a lower<br>
forming moisture process that improves size application efficiency. Another result is a<br>
lower consumption rate of water.<br>
The effectiveness of a cooling system is related to the distribution of cooling fluid<br>
on the filaments and the ability of the cooling fluid to penetrate into the filament fan.<br>
Conventional cooling systems utilize nozzles that are unable to sufficiently penetrate the<br>
filament fan. Moreover, conventional nozzles provide inadequate coverage of cooling<br>
fluid on the filaments. Filaments that are conditioned by conventional cooling systems<br>
often have a non-uniform temperature distribution, which adversely affects the quality of<br>
resulting products.<br>
The cooling system of the present invention enhances the reduction in temperature<br>
of the filaments. The system also reduces the variations in temperature within-position<br>
and position-to-position. Within-position temperature variations are the variations or<br>
averages that are obtained for a single forming position or bushing. Position-to-position<br>
temperature variations represent the differences from one bushing position to another<br>
along a particular forehearth.<br>
The results achieved by the cooling system of the present invention are due to a<br>
balance between several factors, including: the flow rate of the cooling fluids, such as<br>
water and/or air, the nozzle locations; the angle at which the sprays are applied; and the<br>
spacing between nozzles. Regarding the nozzle locations, the nozzles should be far<br>
enough from, the bushing to permit the filaments to sufficiently form. The nozzles should<br>
also be located far enough upstream from the size applicators to maximize the effect of the<br>
cooling fluid.<br>
The angle at which the sprays are applied affects the depth of penetration of the<br>
filaments by the cooling fluid. Since a boundary layer is formed along the attenuated<br>
filaments, the penetration of the boundary layer and filament fan is a function of the<br>
direction of the sprays. When nozzles are oriented to blow from front to back across the<br>
filaments, much less air is carried with the filaments to the size applicator. If too much air<br>
is carried with the filaments, the size applicator may become dry, thereby adversely<br>
impacting the size application process.<br>
The spacing between nozzles is determined by the spray coverage of each nozzle<br>
and the desired coverage of the filaments. The nozzles can be placed so that each nozzle"s<br>
spray coverage overlaps that of another nozzle to a particular degree. This arrangement<br>
ensures that the filaments are covered with the cooling fluid.<br>
Many of the "plate outs" discussed above occur inside the fiber fan and not at the<br>
edges. Trapped hot air inside the fiber fan contributes to the frequency of "plate outs."<br>
The present invention includes a splitter shoe or comb between the size application and a<br>
gathering shoe to separate each fiber fan into several bundles or splits.<br>
The use of nozzles to spray the cooling fluids provides several benefits. For<br>
example, the output or spray distribution from a nozzle is adjustable. The nozzle also<br>
provides the localization or the concentration of the cooling fluid on a particular area.<br>
A filament forming system is shown in Fig. 1. The filament forming system 5<br>
includes forehearth 10 and a bushing 12 having a plurality of orifices through which a<br>
plurality of streams of molten glass are discharged.<br>
The filaments 30 are pulled downwardly by a winding apparatus 20 into a forming<br>
fan 32. The filaments 30 subsequently contact a size applicator 14 and a gathering shoe<br>
16. The applicator 14 coats the filaments 30 with a size or binder material. The applicator<br>
14 can be a belt applicator or any other conventional size applicator. The gathering shoe<br>
16 gathers the filaments 30 into one or more strands 34. The strand 34 is wound onto a<br>
rotating collet 18 to form a package 36.<br>
The filament forming system 5 includes a splitter shoe or comb 40 that is mounted<br>
on a rotating base 42. The comb 40 includes several teeth that separate the filaments into<br>
the desired number of strands. It will be appreciated that the base 42 can be rotated to<br>
move the comb 40 into and out of engagement with the filaments 30.<br>
The filament forming system 5 includes a cooling system 100 that conditions the<br>
filaments 30 upstream of the size applicator 14. In the illustrated embodiment, the cooling<br>
system is a fluid spray system that directs a cooling fluid into engagement with the<br>
filaments 34.<br>
A cooling system 100 embodying the principles of the invention is illustrated in<br>
Fig. 2. As previously discussed, filaments 30 are attenuated from bushing 12 and<br>
subsequently contact size applicator 14. Filaments 30 are attenuated from the bushing 12<br>
at very high rates of speed and have a high temperature. The filaments 30 are attenuated<br>
along the direction of arrow "A", referred to as the attenuation direction. Filaments<br>
entrain air during formation. Accordingly, air is pulled into the filament fan as the<br>
filaments are attenuated. The temperature and the movement of the filaments creates a<br>
boundary layer 144.<br>
The cooling system 100 illustrated in Fig. 2 includes multiple layers of nozzles<br>
130, 132. Several nozzles 130 (only one shown) are located at a first position 120 with<br>
respect to the bushing bottom plate 13. Nozzle 130 is coupled to a manifold 124 which<br>
supplies a fluid to the nozzle 130. The nozzle 130 is oriented with its outlet port 134<br>
directed at the filaments 30 in a first cooling region 160. During operation, the nozzle 130<br>
directs spray 140 at the filaments.<br>
Nozzles 132 are located at a second position 122 relative to the bushing 12.<br>
Nozzle 132 is coupled to a manifold 126 which supplies a fluid to the nozzle 132. The<br>
nozzle 132 is oriented with its outlet port 136 directed at the filaments 30 in a second<br>
cooling region 162. Spray 142 is directed at the filaments 130 from the second nozzle<br>
132.<br>
In the illustrated embodiment, the fluid supplied to nozzle 130 and forming spray<br>
140 is air and the fluid supplied to nozzle 132 and forming spray 142 is water. The air<br>
cools the filaments and the water lubricates and further cools the filaments.<br>
Preferably, the sprays 140, 142 are discharged from the nozzles 130,132 with<br>
sufficient momentum to pass through the boundary layer 144 and contact the filaments 30.<br>
For example, the total flow volume through nozzles 130 is in the range of 16 to 24<br>
gallons/hr and the total flow volume through nozzles 132 is in the range of 16 to 24<br>
gallons/hr. A higher momentum can be achieved with compressed air in nozzles 130 than<br>
water in nozzles 132.<br>
It will be appreciated that the distance between the nozzles 130,132 may vary<br>
depending on the desired temperature changes. Similarly, the distance between the<br>
nozzles 130 and the bushing 12 and the distance between the nozzles 132 and the size<br>
applicator 14 may vary. The angle at which the nozzles 130, 132 are oriented with respect<br>
to the bushing bottom plate 13 may be adjusted.<br>
Another embodiment of a cooling system embodying the principles of the<br>
invention is illustrated in Figs. 3 and 4. Filaments 30 are attenuated from the bottom plate<br>
13 of the bushing 12. Front and rear sides of the filament forming system 5 are defined<br>
relative to the side of the size applicator 14 that the filaments 30 contact. The side of the<br>
size applicator 14 that the filaments 30 contact is referred to as the front of the forming<br>
system. Accordingly, the rear side of the filament forming system is on the opposite side<br>
of the size applicator.<br>
Several nozzle positions are identified in Fig. 3. A primary front position 110 is<br>
shown on the front side of the filament forming system 5. A primary rear position 112 and<br>
a secondary rear position 114 are illustrated on the rear side of the system 5. Nozzles 130<br>
are shown in each of the positions 110, 112, 114. It will be appreciated that nozzles can be<br>
provided in any combination of the positions 110, 112, and 114. For example, nozzles 130<br>
may be located only in position 110.<br>
Each of the nozzles 130 is mounted at an angle C with respect to a horizontal plane<br>
that is parallel to the bushing bottom plate 13. Angle C is typically in the range of 0 to<br>
35°. It will be appreciated that this angle may vary for each nozzle for many reasons,<br>
including the type of filaments being attenuated, the desired disbursement of the sprays,<br>
the number of nozzles used, the positions in which the nozzles are located, etc.<br>
The nozzles 130 in position 110 are preferably in alignment in a row as shown in<br>
Fig. 4. An exemplary arrangement of the nozzles is illustrated in Fig. 4. The nozzles 130<br>
may be positioned in two or more groups depending on the desired spray distribution.<br>
The following dimensions are utilized to further describe the cooling system<br>
illustrated in Figs. 3 and 4. In this exemplary embodiment, nozzles 130 are located in<br>
position 110 only. The dimensions corresponding to the various reference letters are set<br>
forth below:<br>
A=14 inches (35.6 cm)<br>
C = 0 degrees<br>
D = 3 inches (7.6 cm)<br>
E=14 inches (35.6 cm)<br>
F= 1.75 inches (4.5 cm)<br>
G= 11.25 inches (28.5 cm)<br>
It will be appreciated that the above dimensions can be varied to modify the<br>
distribution of the spray on the filaments. In an alternative embodiment, the A, C, and D<br>
dimensions can be varied depending on the type of nozzle used and the desired distribution<br>
of the spray. Some of the relevant dimensions are:<br>
A = 14 inches (35.6 cm)<br>
C = 15 degrees (up from a horizontal plane)<br>
D = 2 inches (5.1 cm)<br>
Mist jet nozzles, discussed in greater detail below, may be utilized in this alternative<br>
embodiment.<br>
An alternative embodiment of a cooling system embodying the principles of the<br>
invention is now described. In this embodiment, nozzles 130 are air-atomizing nozzles<br>
that spray a mixture of air and water. It will be appreciated that air-atomizing nozzles may<br>
also be used with a layer of air nozzles and/or water nozzles.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 5, nozzles 130 are fluidically coupled to manifolds 124, 126.<br>
Manifold 124 is connected to a compressed air supply (not shown) and to an inlet port 138<br>
of the nozzles 130. Manifold 124 is connected to a pressurized water supply (not shown)<br>
and to another inlet port 139 of the nozzles 130.<br>
The relative positions of the manifolds 124, 126 in this embodiment are illustrated<br>
in Fig. 6. Each nozzle 130 has an inlet port 138 coupled to manifold 124 and an inlet port<br>
139 to manifold 126.<br>
The degree of atomization of water achieved by air-atomizing nozzles is<br>
determined by the relative pressures and flow rates of the water and air. The water and air<br>
may be mixed either external to or inside the air-atomizing nozzle. Compressed air is used<br>
to atomize and drive the water sprays. An advantage of this nozzle is that spray<br>
momentum due to the air flow is separated from the water flow rate. As a result, deep<br>
penetration to the filament fan can be easily achieved using a low water volume. It will be<br>
appreciated that the atomization may be varied depending on the desired spray and particle<br>
size.<br>
As discussed above, the filament forming system 5 includes a comb 40 that is<br>
movable into engagement with the filaments 30 to separate the filaments 30 into strands or<br>
bundles. As the bundles are separated apart, air can flow between the bundles of filaments<br>
30 to cool them, thereby enhancing a deeper penetration of the filaments by the cooling<br>
fluid. The teeth on the comb can be designed to achieve a particular arrangement of<br>
bundles to maximize the effectiveness of the cooling spray systems.<br>
Several different types of nozzles may be utilized to achieve the desired cooling<br>
and lubrication of the filaments. The preferred material for each of the nozzles and the<br>
manifolds is stainless steel.<br>
One type of nozzle is a water-pressurized mist-jet nozzle. The mist-jet nozzle can<br>
be used to spray cooling water. An exemplary mist-jet nozzle is a hollow cone model<br>
A200 from Steinen Manufacturing Co. The mist-jet nozzle utilizes internal fluid pressure<br>
to atomize the fluid in the nozzle instead of a second fluid. A hollow cone spray pattern is<br>
essentially a circular ring of liquid. This pattern is generally formed by using an inlet<br>
tangential to a whirl chamber, or by an internal grooved vane immediately upstream from<br>
the orifice. The whirling liquid results in a hollow cone configuration as it leaves the<br>
output orifice.<br>
Another type of nozzle is an external-mix, flat spray air-atomizing nozzle. An<br>
exemplary air-atomizing nozzle includes body model SUE 18A, fluid cap model 2050-SS<br>
and air cap model 62240-60 from Spraying Systems Co. in Wheaton, Illinois. A flat spray<br>
nozzle distributes the spray with a flat- or sheet-type appearance. The sprays from this<br>
type of nozzle apply both air cooling and pre-pad water lubrication at the same time.<br>
Accordingly, more cooling can be accomplished with out increasing the applied pre-pad<br>
moisture. The flow rate and momentum of both air and water can be independently<br>
controlled.<br>
Another type of nozzle is a compressed air nozzle. Some compressed air nozzles<br>
include: Vee-jet nozzles, Windjet nozzles, and blow-off nozzles. Each of these nozzles is<br>
operated by compressed air. Alternatively, the Vee-jet nozzle may be operated by<br>
pressurized water.<br>
An exemplary Vee-Jet nozzle is model T800050 from Spraying Systems. Vee-jet<br>
nozzles apply a thin, flat spray coverage and are capable of applying higher spray<br>
momentum and wider spray angles. An exemplary Windjet nozzle is model 727 from<br>
Spraying Systems. This Windjet nozzle generates a controlled flat fan distribution of<br>
compressed air. The blow-off nozzles may be L type or P type blow-off nozzles from<br>
Spraying Systems Co.<br>
Tests were conducted showing the effect that replacing conventional water pre-pad<br>
nozzles with different embodiments of the present invention has on temperature and other<br>
product characteristics. The process trials were run on various products using cooling<br>
methods of the present invention. Various product physical properties were evaluated.<br>
The tests show that the use of the cooling systems of the present invention reduces<br>
filament temperature and reduces moisture, as is seen be referring to the Table below. The<br>
temperatures below are in degrees Fahrenheit. Forming moisture percent is determined by<br>
weighing the package directly off the collet. The package is then reweighed after drying<br>
to measure the amount of water that was originally in the package. The forming solids<br>
percent is the percent of the gross strand weight that is chemical applied to the filaments.<br>
The "T#" values represent the temperature readings at different thermocouples located in a<br>
row perpendicular to the direction in which the filaments are attenuated. T1 represents the<br>
left most temperature reading and T19 represents the right most temperature reading of the<br>
filament fan as viewed from the front side of the filament forming system. The other<br>
readings are located between the filament fan.<br>
A first series of trials were conducted comparing conventional oil burner nozzles<br>
and mist-jet nozzles to apply a water spray on the filaments. A conventional standard oil<br>
burner nozzle setup was used in Trial 1 in Table A below. Trials 1-6 utilized two groups<br>
of four nozzles each. Trials 7-8 in Table A utilized two groups of five nozzles each.<br>
The dimensions provided in Table A relate to the reference characters A and D<br>
illustrated in Figs. 3 and 4. The angle values in Table A represent the angle of the nozzles<br>
relative to a horizontal plane parallel to the bushing bottom plate. The letters (d) and (u)<br>
represent angles down from or up above the horizontal plane, respectively. The spacing of<br>
the nozzles varied1 between Trials 1-6 and Trials 7-8. In Trials 1-6, the centers of the two<br>
groups of nozzles were approximately 11.25 inches (28.5 cm) apart. The distance between<br>
adjacent nozzles in a group was 2 inches (5.1 cm). In Trials 7-8, the centers of the two<br>
groups of nozzles were approximately 11.25 inches (28.5 cm) apart and the distance<br>
between adjacent nozzles in a group was 1.75 inches (4.5 cm).<br>
The pressure values in the "Press (psi)" column represent the water pressure in the<br>
nozzles. In Trials 7 and 8, the pressure values represent those of the five nozzles in each<br>
group. For example, in Trial 7, three of the five nozzles in each group were operating at<br>
95 psi (655 kPa) and the other nozzles in the group were at 40 psi (276 (kPa).<br>
The volume indicated in the "Total Flow Volume (gph)" column represent the flow<br>
of water through the nozzles collectively. While the total flow volume for Trial 7 was 20<br>
gph, the flow volume varied among the nozzles. The nozzles in each group had flow<br>
volumes of 1.5 gph, 2 gph, 3 gph, 2 gph, and 1.5 gph, with the 3 gph nozzle being the<br>
center nozzle in the arrangement. Similarly, the flow volumes of the nozzles in Trial 8<br>
were 2 gph, 2.5 gph, 3 gph, 2.5 gph, and 2 gph. Finally, the mist-jet nozzles used were<br>
model A200 from Steinen Manufacturing, with the exception that in Trial 7, one of the<br>
nozzles with a pressure of 95 and flow volume of 1.5 gph was model A100 from Steinen.<br>
A second series of trials were conducted comparing a conventional pre-pad nozzles<br>
and flat-jet nozzles for air and water. The results of these trials are illustrated in Table B<br>
below.<br>
In Trial 9, conventional pre-pad water spray nozzles were used. In Trials 10-13,<br>
flat-jet water nozzles were used instead of the conventional water spray nozzles. In Trials<br>
14-20, the flat-jet air nozzles were used in addition to convention water spray nozzles.<br>
The types of nozzle models and the nozzle arrangements varied in Trials 10-20. In<br>
Trials 10, 11, 14-16, 19, and 20, two groups of two nozzles each were used. The centers<br>
of the groups were located 11.25 inches (28.5 cm) apart. The centers of the nozzles in<br>
each group were 4.75 inches (12.1 cm) apart. In Trials 10, 11, and 14-16, nozzle model<br>
T8001 from Spraying Systems was used. In Trials 19 and 20, nozzle model T800050 from<br>
Spraying Systems was used.<br>
In Trials 12 and 13, two groups of three nozzles each were used. The centers of the<br>
groups were located 11.25 inches (28.5 cm) apart. The centers of the nozzles in each<br>
group were 3 inches apart. The nozzles in each group for these two trials were model<br>
T800050 on the ends and model T8001 in the center.<br>
In Trials 17 and 18, only two nozzles were used. The centers of the nozzles were<br>
spaced 11.25 inches (28.5 cm) apart. In these two trials, nozzle model Tl 10010 from<br>
Spraying Systems was used.<br>
In Trials 9-11 and 14-20, the total flow volume was evenly distributed to the<br>
nozzles in each group. In Trial 12, the flow volumes were 2.5 gph for the two end nozzles<br>
and 5 gph for the center nozzle. Similarly, in Trial 13, the flow volumes were 3 gph, 6<br>
gph, and 3 gph.<br>
A third series of trials were conducted comparing conventional pre-pad water spray<br>
nozzles and air-atomizing nozzles. The results of these trials are illustrated in Table C<br>
below.<br>
In Trial 21, conventional pre-pad water spray nozzles were used. In Trials 22-33,<br>
twin-fluid air-atomizing nozzles were used instead of the conventional water spray<br>
nozzles.<br>
The nozzle models and the nozzle arrangements varied in Trials 22-33. In Trials<br>
22-30, two groups of two nozzles each were used. The two groups of nozzles were spaced<br>
7 inches apart. The centers of the nozzles in each group were 4.25 inches (10.8 cm) apart.<br>
In Trials 22-27, nozzle model A2050 from Spraying Systems Co. was used. In Trials 28-<br>
30, nozzle model A1650 from Spraying Systems was used.<br>
In Trials 31-33, one group of two nozzles and one group of three nozzles were<br>
used. The centers of the groups were located 11.25 inches (28.5 cm) apart. In the groups<br>
of two nozzles, the centers of the nozzles were 4.25 inches (10.8 cm) apart. In the groups<br>
of three nozzles, the centers of the nozzles were 3 inches (7.6 cm) apart. For reasons of<br>
simplicity, the group of two nozzles is referred to as the left group and the group of three<br>
nozzles is referred to as the right group, from the perspective of the front side of the<br>
system, as described above.<br>
In Trial 31, the left and right nozzles were model Al 650. In Trial 32, the left and<br>
right nozzles were model A1450. In Trial 33, the left nozzles were model A1650 and the<br>
right nozzles were model A1450.<br>
The pressure information in Table C includes two numbers for the trials. The first<br>
number is the water pressure in psi and the second number is the air pressure in psi.<br>
In Trials 31-33, data was collected regarding the left and right filament fans. In<br>
Trials 31 and 32, the same water and air pressures were used in the left and right groups of<br>
nozzles. In Trial 33, the water and air pressures for the left group of nozzles directed at the<br>
left filament fan were 65 and 15 psi (448 and 103 kPa), respectively. The water and air<br>
pressures for the right group of nozzles were 95 and 15 psi (655 and 103 kPa),<br>
respectively.<br>
In Trials 31-33, the total flow volumes to the left and right groups of nozzles are<br>
represented by 7 and 10.5 gph, respectively. Finally, the moisture percentage and the<br>
strand solids percentage for each of the fans is separately indicated with the first value<br>
corresponding to the left fan and the second value corresponding to the right fan.<br>
It will be appreciated that there are many variations on the particular embodiments<br>
discussed above that would be consistent with the principles of the invention.<br>
For example, in a cooling system with nozzles at multiple positions, the first fluid<br>
sprayed on the filaments can be water and the second fluid sprayed on the filaments can be<br>
air.<br>
The number of nozzles in a particular layer or level of the cooling system may vary<br>
depending on the area of filaments to be cooled, the arrangement of the bushing bottom<br>
plate.<br>
The bushing and its bottom plate may have an annular configuration.<br>
Another cooling fluid other than water or air may be used so long as the integrity<br>
of the filaments and the filament forming process is maintained.<br>
The spacing of nozzles in a particular row can be centered on a bottom plate of the<br>
bushing. The nozzle may be symmetrical about the center of the bottom plate as well.<br>
The nozzles may be equally spaced apart. Alternatively, the spacing between nozzles may<br>
be non-uniform for various reasons, including anticipated heating patterns of the filaments<br>
in a fan.<br>
The flow rate of cooling fluid may be uniform for all nozzle in a particular nozzle<br>
position. Alternatively, the flow rate may vary among the nozzles. For example, since the<br>
center region of a filament fan is typically warmer than the edges of the fan, the nozzles<br>
directed at the center region may spray cooling fluid at a higher momentum and higher<br>
flow rate than nozzles at the edges.<br>
The size material can be applied with a size applicator other than a pad or belt<br>
arrangement. For example, the size material may be sprayed onto the filaments which<br>
subsequently contact a surface which collects the excess size material that has been<br>
sprayed.<br>
The cooling system of the present invention provides a greater temperature<br>
reduction in the filaments than a conventional pre-pad spray system. The temperature<br>
uniformity of the filaments attenuated from a single bushing and of the filaments<br>
attenuated from multiple bushings on a forehearth is enhanced.<br>
The cooling system of the present invention achieves a better uniform fluid<br>
distribution on the filaments. These nozzles also provide a finer particle size, which<br>
results in less water consumed during the cooling process. As a momentum of a spray at<br>
discharge increases, the penetration into the boundary layer adjacent the filaments<br>
increases, thereby providing a more uniform coverage. Aa end result is that a lower<br>
filament temperature can be achieved using less cooling fluid.<br>
