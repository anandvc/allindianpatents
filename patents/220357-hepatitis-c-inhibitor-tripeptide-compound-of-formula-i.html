FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to compounds, processes for their synthesis, compositions and methods for the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. In particular, the present invention provides novel peptide analogs, pharmaceutical compositions containing such analogs and methods for using these analogs in the treatment of HCV infection.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the major etiological agent of post-transfusion and community-acquired non-A non-B hepatitis worldwide. It is estimated that over 200 million people worldwide are infected by the virus. A high percentage of carriers become chronically infected and many progress to chronic liver disease, so-called chronic hepatitis C. This group is in turn at high risk for serious liver disease such as liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and terminal liver disease leading to death.<br>
The mechanism by which HCV establishes viral persistence and causes a high rate of chronic liver disease has not been thoroughly elucidated. It is not known how HCV interacts with and evades the host immune system. In addition, the roles of cellular and humoral immune responses in protection against HCV infection and •disease have yet to be established. Immunoglobulins have been reported for prophylaxis of transfusion-associated viral hepatitis, however, the Center for Disease Control does not presently recommend immunoglobulins treatment for this purpose. The lack of an effective protective immune response is hampering the development of a vaccine or adequate post-exposure prophylaxis measures, so in the near-term, hopes are firmly pinned on antiviral interventions.<br>
Various clinical studies have been conducted with the goal of identifying pharmaceutical agents capable of effectively treating HCV infection in patients afflicted with chronic hepatitis C. These studies have involved the use of interferon-alpha, alone and in combination with other antiviral agents. Such studies have shown that a substantial number of the participants do not respond to these<br><br>
therapies, and of those that do respond favorably, a large proportion were found to relapse after termination of treatment.<br>
Until recently, interferon (IFN) was the only available therapy of proven benefit approved in the clinic for patients with chronic hepatitis C. However the sustained response rate is low, and interferon treatment also induces severe side-effects (i.e. retinopathy, thyroiditis, acute pancreatitis, depression) that diminish the quality of life of treated patients. Recently, interferon in combination with ribavirin has been approved for patients non-responsive to IFN alone. However, the side effects caused by IFN are not alleviated with this combination therapy. Pegylated forms of interferons such as PEG-lntron® and Pegasys® can apparently partially address these deleterious side-effects but antiviral drugs still remain the avenue of choice for oral treatment of HCV.<br>
Therefore, a need exists for the development of effective antiviral agents for treatment of HCV infection that overcome the limitations of existing pharmaceutical therapies.<br>
HCV is an enveloped positive strand RNA virus in the Flaviviridae family. The single strand HCV RNA genome is approximately 9500 nucleotides in length and has a single open reading frame (ORF) encoding a single large polyprotein of about 3000 amino acids. In infected cells, this polyprotein is cleaved at multiple sites by cellular and viral proteases to produce the structural and non-structural (NS) proteins. In the case of HCV, the generation of mature nonstructural proteins (NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B) is effected by two viral proteases. The first one, as yet poorly characterized, cleaves at the NS2-NS3 junction (henceforth referred to as NS2/3 protease); the second one is a serine protease contained within the N-terminal region of NS3 (NS3 protease) and mediates all the subsequent cleavages downstream of NS3, both in cis, at the NS3-NS4A cleavage site, and in trans, for the remaining NS4A-NS4B, NS4B-NS5A, NS5A-NS5B sites. The NS4A protein appears to serve multiple functions, acting as a cofactor for the NS3 protease and possibly assisting in the membrane localization of NS3 and other viral replicase components. The complex formation of the NS3 protease with NS4A seems necessary to the processing events, enhancing the proteolytic efficiency at all of the<br><br>
sites. The NS3 protein also exhibits nucleoside triphosphatase and RNA helicase activities. NS5B is a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that is involved in the replication of HCV.<br>
A general strategy for the development of antiviral agents is to inactivate virally encoded enzymes that are essential for the replication of the virus.<br>
The following is a list of patent applications published in the last few years that disclose HCV NS3 protease inhibitor peptide analogs that are structurally different from the compounds of the present invention:<br>
GB 2,337,262; JP10298151; JP 11126861; JP 11292840; JP 2001-103993; US 6,159,938; US 6,187,905; WO 97/43310; WO 98/17679; WO 98/22496; WO 98/46597; WO 98/46630; WO 99/38888; WO 99/50230; WO 99/64442; WO 99/07733; WO 99/07734; WO 00/09543; WO 00/09558; WO 00/20400; WO 00/59929; WO 00/31129; WO 01/02424; WO 01/07407; WO 01/16357; WO 01/32691; WO 01/40262; WO 01/58929; WO 01/64678; WO 01/74768; WO 01/77113; WO 01/81325; WO 02/08187; WO 02/08198; WO 02/08244; WO 02/08251; WO 02/08256; WO 02/18369; WO 02/60926 and WO 02/79234.<br>
One advantage of the present invention is that it provides tripeptide compounds that are inhibitory to the NS3 protease, an enzyme essential for the replication of the hepatitis C virus.<br>
A further advantage of one aspect of the present invention resides in the fact that the compounds specifically inhibit the NS3 protease and do not show significant inhibitory activity against other serine proteases such as human leukocyte elastase (HLE), porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE), or bovine pancreatic chymotrypsin, or cysteine proteases such as human liver cathepsin B (Cat B). Furthermore, the compounds are active in cell culture and have good pharmacokinetic profile in vivo.<br>
A further advantage of the present invention is that it provides compounds that are orally bioavailable in mammals.<br><br>

EXAMPLE 10<br>
Cell Based HCV RNA Replication Assay<br>
Cell Culture<br>
Huh7 cells that stably maintain a subgenomic HCV replicon were established as<br>
previously described (Lohman et al., 1999. Science 285: 110-113) and designated<br>
as the S22.3 cell-line. S22.3 cells are maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Earle<br>
Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1mg/ml_ neomycin (Standard Medium). During the assay, DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS, containing 0.5% DMSO and lacking neomycin was used (Assay Medium). 16 hours prior to compound addition, S22.3 cells are trypsinized and diluted to 50 000 cells/ml in Standard Medium. 200uL (10 000 cells) are distributed into each well of a 96-well plate. The plate was then incubated at 37° with 5% C02 until the next day.<br>
Reagents and Materials:<br><br>

Preparation of Test Compound<br>
10uL of test compound (in 100% DMSO) was added to 2 ml of Assay Medium for a final DMSO concentration of 0.5% and the solution was sonicated for 15 min and filtered through a 0.22uM Millipore Filter Unit. 900ul was transfered into row A of a Polypropylene Deep-Well Titer Plate. Rows B to H, contain 400|jL aliquots of Assay Medium (containing 0.5% DMSO), and are used to prepare serial dilutions (1/2) by transferring 400ul from row to row (no compound was included in row H).<br>
Application of test compound to cells<br>
Cell culture medium was aspirated from the 96-well plate containing the S22.3 cells. 175uL of assay medium with the appropriate dilution of test compound was transferred from each well of the compound plate to the corresponding well of the cell culture plate (row H was used as the "No inhibition control"). The cell culture plate was incubated at 37° with 5% C02for 72h.<br>
Extraction of Total Cellular RNA<br>
Following the 72h incubation period, the total cellular RNA was extracted from the S22.3 cells of the 96-well plate using the RNeasy 96 kit (Qiagen®, RNeasy Handbook. 1999.). Briefly, assay medium was completely removed from cells and 100 pL of RLT buffer (Qiagen®) containing 143 mM p-mercaptoethanol was added to each well of the 96-well cell-culture plate. The microplate was gently shaken for 20 sec. 100 ML of 70% ethanol was then added to each microplate well, and mixed by pipetting. The lysate was removed and applied to the wells of a RNeasy 96 (Qiagen®) plate that was placed on top of a Qiagen® Square-Well Block. The RNeasy 96 plate was sealed with tape and the Square-Well Block with the RNeasy 96 plate was loaded into the holder and placed in a rotor bucket of a 4K15C centrifuge. The sample was centrifuged at 6000 rpm (~5600 x g) for 4 min at room temperature. The tape was removed from the plate and 0.8 ml of Buffer RW1 (Qiagen® RNeasy 96 kit) was added to each well of the RNeasy 96 plate. The RNeasy 96 plate was sealed with a new piece of tape and centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 4 min at room temperature. The RNeasy 96 plate was placed on top of another clean Square-Well Block, the tape removed and 0.8 ml of Buffer RPE (Qiagen® RNeasy 96 kit) was added to each well of the RNeasy 96 plate. The RNeasy 96 plate was sealed with a new piece of tape and centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 4 min at room temperature. The tape was removed and another 0.8 ml of Buffer RPE (Qiagen® RNeasy 96 kit) was added to each well of the RNeasy 96 plate. The RNeasy 96 plate was sealed with a new piece of tape and centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 min at room temperature. Tape was removed, the RNeasy 96 plate was placed on top of a rack containing 1.2-mL collection microtubes. The RNA was eluted by adding 50 uL of RNase-free water to each well, sealing plate with a new piece of tape and incubated for 1 min at room temperature. The plate was then centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 4 min at room temperature. The elution step was repeated with a second volume of 50 pi RNase-free water. The microtubes with total cellular RNA are stored at -70°.<br>
Quantification of Total Cellular RNA<br>
RNA was quantified on the STORM® system (Molecular Dynamics®) using the<br>
RiboGreen® RNA Quantification Kit (Molecular Probes®). Briefly, the RiboGreen<br>
reagent was diluted 200-fold in TE (10mM Tris-HCI pH =7.5, 1mM EDTA). Generally, 50uL of reagent was diluted in 10mL TE. A Standard Curve of ribosomal RNA was diluted in TE to 2ug/mL and pre-determined amounts (100, 50, 40, 20, 10, 5, 2 and OuL) of the ribosomal RNA solution are then transferred in a new 96-well plate (COSTAR # 3997) and the volume was completed to 100ul_ with TE. Generally, column 1 of the 96-well plate was used for the standard curve and the other wells are used for the RNA samples to be quantified. 10uL of each RNA sample that was to be quantified, was transferred to the corresponding well of the 96-well plate and 90uL of TE was added. One volume (100uL) of diluted RiboGreen reagent was added to each well of the 96-well plate and incubated for 2 to 5 minutes at room temperature, protected from light (a 10 DL RNA sample in a 200 uL final volume generates a 20 X dilution). The fluorescence intensity of each well was measured on the STORM® system (Molecular Dynamics®). A standard curve was created on the basis of the known quantities of the ribosomal RNA and the resulting fluorescent intensities. The RNA concentration in the experimental samples was determined from the standard curve and corrected for the 20X dilution.<br>

Real-Time RT-PCR<br>
The Real-Time RT-PCR was performed on the ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System using the TaqMan EZ RT-PCR Kit from (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems®). RT-PCR was optimized for the quantification of the 5' IRES of HCV RNA by using the Taqman technology (Roche Molecular Diagnostics Systems) similar to the technique previously described (Martell et al., 1999. J. Clin. Microbiol.<br><br>
37: 327-332). The system exploits the 5'-3' nucleolytic activity of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase. Briefly, the method utilizes a dual-labeled fluorogenic hybridization probe (PUTR Probe) that specifically anneals to the template between the PCR primers (primers 8125 and 7028). The 5' end of the probe contains a fluorescent reporter (6-carboxyfluorescein [FAM]) and the 3' end contains a fluorescent quencher (6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine[TAMRA]). The FAM reporter's emission spectrum was suppressed by the quencher on the intact hybridization probe. Nuclease degradation of the hybridization probe releases the reporter, resulting in an increase in fluorescence emission. The ABI Prism 7700 sequence detector measures the increase in fluorescence emission continuously during the PCR amplification such that the amplified product was directly proportion to the signal. The amplification plot was analysed early in the reaction at a point that represents the logarithmic phase of product accumulation. A point representing a defined detection threshold of the increase in the fluorescent signal associated with the exponential growth of the PCR product for the sequence detector was defined as the cycle threshold (Cr). CT-values are inversely proportional to the quantity of input HCV RNA; such that under identical PCR conditions, the larger the starting concentration of HCV RNA, the lower the CT. A standard curve was created automatically by the ABI Prism 7700 detection system by plotting the CT-against each standard dilution of known HCV RNA concentration.<br>
Reference samples for the standard curve are included on each RT-PCR plate. HCV Replicon RNA was synthesized (by T7 transcription) in vitro, purified and quantified by OD26o. Considering that 1ug of this RNA = 2.15 X 1011 RNA copies, dilutions are made in order to have 108, 107, 106, 105, 104, 103 or 102 genomic RNA copies / 5uL Total cellular Huh-7 RNA was also incorporated with each dilution (50ng / 5ul_). 5uL of each reference standard (HCV Replicon + Huh-7 RNA) was combined with 45uL of Reagent Mix, and used in the Real-Time RT-PCR reaction.<br>
The Real-Time RT-PCR reaction was set-up for the experimental samples that were purified on RNeasy 96 -well plates by combining 5ul of each total cellular RNA sample with 45uL of Reagent Mix.<br>

Following the termination of the RT-PCR reaction the data analysis requires setting of threshold fluorescence signal for the PCR plate and a standard curve was constructed by plotting the Ct value versus RNA copy number used in each reference reaction. The Ct values obtained for the assay samples are used to interpolate an RNA copy number based on the standard curve. Finally, the RNA copy number was normalized (based on the RiboGreen RNA quantification of the total RNA extracted from the cell culture well) and expressed as genome equivalents / ug of total RNA [ge/ug].<br>
The RNA copy number [g.e./ug] from each well of the cell culture plate was a measure of the amount of replicating HCV RNA in the presence of various concentrations of inhibitor. The % inhibition was calculated with the following equation:<br>
A non-linear curve fit with the Hill model was applied to the inhibition-concentration data, and the 50% effective concentration (EC50) was calculated by the use of SAS software (Statistical Software System; SAS Institute, Inc. Gary, N.C.).<br>
When the compounds of this invention were evaluated in the preceding enzymatic and cell based assays, the compounds were found to be highly active. More specifically, the compounds had IC50's below 0.1 uM in the NS3-NS4A protease assay, and EC50's below 0.5 uM in the cell based HCV RNA replication assay.<br>

the Human Leukocyte Elastase and Cathepsin B assays.<br>

Pharmacokinetic properties<br>
The present compounds also show good pharmacokinetic properties such as<br>
detectable plasma levels in the rat at 1 hour and 2h after an oral dose of 4 or<br>
5mg/kg.<br>
More explicitly, the following assay, an in vivo oral absorption screen, was used to<br>
determine plasma levels of test compounds in a rat after oral administration:<br>
Materials and Methods:<br>
1.        Method used to pool compounds ("cassette selection"):<br>
The selection of compounds to be pooled into a "cassette" was based on their structural similarity and physicochemical properties. A solid phase extraction method applicable to all the selected compounds was established. Based on the initial testing where each compound was spiked into rat plasma and run through HPLC or HPLC/MS at a concentration of 0.5 uM, the retention time, ionic mass, and the possible separation among compounds by HPLC and/or HPLC/MS were used<br>
as basis for pooling 3-4 compounds into one "cassette".<br>
2.	Oral vehicle and compound preparation:<br>
Each "cassette" contains 3-4 compounds at 5 or 4mg/kg for each compound. The cassettes were prepared as an oral suspension in 0.5% aqueous methylcellulose and 0.3% of polyoxyethylene (20) sorbiton monooleate (Tween-80). The dosing volume was 10mI/kg via oral gavage.<br>
3.	Dosing and plasma sampling:<br>
Male Sprague Dawley rats were fasted overnight in individual cages, with access to aqueous 10% dextrose. Two rats were dosed with each "cassette". Plasma samples (~1 ml) were collected at 1 and 2h post-dosing from the 2 rats and pooled for extraction and analysis.<br>
4.	Compound extraction and analysis:<br>
From each cassette, plasma samples at 1 and 2h, blank plasma, blank plasma spiked with all the compounds at 0.5 uM of each, are extracted by the solid phase extraction method. Samples were analyzed by HPLC and HPLC/MS for comparison purpose. Plasma concentrations are estimated based on the single concentration of 0.5 |jM standard.<br>
Results<br>
When assayed in the preceding screen the compounds of examples 1 to 8 of this invention were found to present in significant levels in the plasma at the 1 hour and 2 hour intervals following oral administration, averaging blood plasma levels of 0.83 uM and 0.75 pM respectively.<br>
This demonstration of in vivo oral absorption for the tripeptide compounds of this invention in noteworthy, in view of the poor oral absortion generally attributed to this class of peptides. The ready oral absorption renders the compounds useful for treating of HCV infection.<br><br><br>
