				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>INSIDE MACHINING CUTTING TOOL DELIVERY APPARATUS An apparatus can deliver a static cutting tool to a position located inside a workpiece to be machined. The cutting tool can be used for machining at least one surface inside of the workpiece. The cutting tool is operable in combination with an electronic controlled machine tool having at least one axially movable drive/support spindle. A cutting tool body can have at least one cutter and anb aperture adapted for receiving the axially movable drive/support spindle of the electronic controlled machine tool. A movable carriage can be used for realeasibly supporting the tool body and for transporting the tool body between a home position, where the tool body is spaced from coaxial alignment with the axially movable drive/support spindle of the electronic controlled machine tool, and a ready position, where the aperture of the tool body is in a coaxially aligned position with respect to the axially movable drive/support spindle of the electronic controlled machine tool. The carriage can be used for transferring support of the cutting tool body with respect to the movable drive/support spindle of the electronic controlled machine tool when the carriage is in the ready position.</td>

a drive for moving the carriage between the home position and the ready position.<br>
2.	The apparatus of claim 1 further comprising:<br>
a releasable lock for holding the tool body supported on the carriage when in the locked position, and for releasing the tool body from the carriage when in the released position,<br>
3.	The apparatus of claim 1 further comprising:<br>
a sensor/switch for detecting if the tool body is supported on the carriage in the locked position.<br>
4.	The apparatus of claim 1 further comprising:<br>
a frame adapted to be releasibly attached to a fixture for supporting the workpiece to be processed.<br>
5.	The apparatus of claim 1 further comprising;   .<br><br>
a drive for moving the carnage from the nome position to a service position.<br>
6.	The apparatus of claim 5, wherein the drive moves the carriage in an arc out of alignment with a path of movement between the home position and the ready position.<br>
7.	The apparatus of claim 1 further comprising:<br>
the tool body separated from the carriage and supported by the at least one drive/support spindle for movement from the ready position to a cutting position for machining at least one inside surface of the workpiece to be processed.<br>
8.	An apparatus for delivering a static cutting tool to a position located<br>
inside a workpiece to be machined, the cutting tool for machining at least one surface<br>
inside of the workpiece, the cutting tool operable in combination with an electronic<br>
controlled machine tool having at least one axially movable drive/support spindle,<br>
comprising:<br>
a cutting tool body having at least one cutter and an aperture adapted for receiving the axially movable drive/support spindle of the electronic controlled machine tool; and<br>
movable carriage means for releasibly supporting the tool body and for transporting the tool body between a home position, where the tool body is spaced from coaxial alignment with the axially movable drive/support spindle of the electronic controlled machine, and a ready position, where the aperture of the tool body is in a coaxially aligned position with respect to the axially movable drive/support spindle of the electronic controlled machine tool, the carriage means for transferring support of the cutting tool body with respect to the movable drive/support spindle of the electronic controlled machine tool when the carriage means is in the ready position.<br>
9.	The apparatus of claim 8 further comprising:<br><br>
drive means for moving the carriage means between the home position and the ready position.<br>
10.	The apparatus of claim 8 further comprising:<br>
releasable lock means for holding the tool body supported on the carriage means when in the locked position, and for releasing the tool body from the carriage means when in the released position.<br>
11.	The apparatus of claim 8 further comprising:<br>
sensor/switch means for detecting if the tool body is supported and<br>
oriented radially and axially correctly on the carriage means in the locked position.<br>
12.	The apparatus of claim 8 further comprising:<br>
