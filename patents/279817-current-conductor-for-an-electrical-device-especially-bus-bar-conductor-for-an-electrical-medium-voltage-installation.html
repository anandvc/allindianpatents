				<td>Current conductor for an electrical device, especially<br>
bus bar conductor for an electrical medium voltage<br>
installation<br>
Description<br>
The invention concerns a current conductor for an<br>
electrical device, especially a bus bar conductor for<br>
an electrical medium voltage switching station.<br>
Known medium voltage switching stations have a current<br>
conductor which has one or two ribbon conductors which<br>
are adjacent to each other, and with which screening<br>
elements, which are formed by semicircular profiles on<br>
both sides of the ribbon conductor, are associated; see<br>
ABB Calor Emag Taschenbuch (pocket book), Schaltanlagen<br>
(switching stations), 10th edition, page 397, Fig. 8-<br>
24.<br>
From EP 572 096, a bus bar conductor system for high<br>
- voltage systems, wherein three bus bars, each<br>
consisting of two bus bar sections in the shape of an<br>
arc of a circle, are fixed to a support, so that<br>
because of the shape a suitable field distribution is<br>
achieved, has become known. Such an arrangement is<br>
intended for high voltage, but not for medium voltage,<br>
which can be seen in particular in the fact that the<br>
bus bars are housed in metal cladding which is<br>
characteristic of high voltage installations.â€“<br>
From DE 31 37 783 Al, a gas-insulated three-phase<br>
current bus bar system, which in one alternative has a<br>
cylindrical shape which is divided in the region of a<br>
surface line, has become known; on the end edges facing<br>
each other, lugs, which project inwards, and via which<br>
connecting conductors, in particular connecting cables,<br>
can be connected with suitable fixing elements, are<br>
formed. In another arrangement which is also described<br>
 <br>
in this published specification, the bus bar consists<br>
of two sections of semi-cylindrical form, the concave<br>
sides of which face each other, the two sections being<br>
fixed to each other by means of a connecting device on<br>
one surface line, and it being possible to fix<br>
connecting elements for connecting cables and similar<br>
on the diametrically opposite surface line.<br>
The construction of such bus bars or current conductors<br>
is complicated.<br>
The object of the invention is to create a current<br>
conductor for an electrical device, especially a bus<br>
bar conductor for an electrical medium voltage<br>
installation, manufacture of said current conductor<br>
being simplified relative to the known device.<br>
This object is achieved with the features of Claim 1.<br>
According to the invention, the current conductor has a<br>
central section of electrically conducting material,<br>
and electrical components, e.g. connecting contact<br>
points and similar, or components of insulating<br>
material, in particular supporting elements, can be<br>
fixed to it. The current conductor also has, on both<br>
sides of the central section, connecting screening<br>
sections of electrically conducting material, which<br>
cover at least this and control the field, the<br>
screening sections also covering any inserted<br>
electrical components.<br>
According to an advantageous version, at least the<br>
central section can be produced from electrically<br>
conducting material by extrusion. Additionally, the<br>
screening elements can also be produced from<br>
electrically conducting material by extrusion.<br>
According to an advantageous version, the central<br>
 <br>
section can be produced from electrically conducting<br>
material by extrusion, in one piece with the screening<br>
elements, in which case the electrically conducting<br>
material can be aluminum or an aluminum alloy.<br>
However, there is also the possibility of producing the<br>
screening elements from electrically conducting<br>
plastic.<br>
According to an advantageous version of the invention,<br>
the central section can have a base section which is<br>
extended lengthways, and on which, preferably<br>
perpendicularly to it, fins which are arranged at<br>
intervals from each other and project in the same<br>
direction are formed, their free ends being provided<br>
with transverse beads, between which the electrical<br>
components can be fixed. The base section can be in<br>
flat or arc-shaped form.<br>
These transverse beads can each form an L or T shape<br>
with the fins, a sufficient distance for fixing the<br>
electrical components or any supporting elements being<br>
formed between the longitudinal edges, which face each<br>
other, of the transverse beads.<br>
The screening sections can connect on the base section<br>
of the central section, and in a further embodiment can<br>
be formed in one piece with it.<br>
In a further version of the invention, the screening<br>
sections can be formed of electrically conducting<br>
plastic.<br>
Each screening element is approximately C-shaped, with<br>
the concave sides facing each other and receiving the<br>
central section between them.<br>
The screening elements can be produced with each other<br>
 <br>
in one piece, preferably of electrically conducting<br>
plastic, it being possible to lock the central section<br>
inside the screening elements.<br>
Further advantageous versions of the invention can be<br>
taken from the other subclaims.<br>
On the basis of the drawings, in which some embodiments<br>
of the invention are shown, the invention, and further<br>
advantageous versions, improvements and further<br>
advantages, will be explained and described in more<br>
detail.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a first embodiment of a bus bar in cross<br>
section,<br>
Fig. 2 shows another embodiment of the bus bar, also<br>
in cross section,<br>
Fig. 3 shows a third embodiment of a bus bar,<br>
Fig. 4 shows a sectional view through the bus bar<br>
according to Fig. 1, and also shows a bus bar<br>
holder, and<br>
Fig. 5 shows three bus bars according to Fig. 1 on a<br>
single bus bar holder, similar to that of Fig.<br>
4.<br>
A bus bar according to the invention, or a current<br>
conductor 10 according to the invention, has a central<br>
section 11, which has a base section 12 in the form of<br>
a ribbon conductor. Onto this base section 12, at<br>
intervals from each other and running perpendicular to<br>
it, fins 13 and 14, on the free ends of which<br>
transverse fins 15 and 16 are formed, the edges 17 and<br>
18 of which, facing each other and having a distance D<br>
between them, are connected. On both sides of the base<br>
 <br>
section 12, approximately C-shaped screening sections<br>
19, 20, the free longitudinal edges 21 and 22 of which,<br>
facing each other, allow access to the central section<br>
11, are connected.<br>
Such an embodiment according to Fig. 1 can preferably<br>
be produced from aluminum by extrusion, without<br>
problems.<br>
Fig. 1 shows an electrical contact point 23, which is<br>
in the form of a tulip contact point with fingers (not<br>
shown in more detail) which are formed on a base plate<br>
24. A T-shaped projection 25, which grips behind the<br>
edges 17 and 18 of the transverse fins 15 and 16, is<br>
provided on the base plate 24, so that the contact<br>
point 23 can be fixed on the central section 11. The<br>
contact point 23 can be locked on, or screwed tight or<br>
pushed in in another suitable manner.<br>
From Figs. 4 and 5, it can be seen that the bus bar 10<br>
- can be fixed on a support 40 of insulating material.<br>
The support 40 of insulating material has elastic<br>
locking arms 41 and 42, which lock in behind the outer<br>
edge of the transverse fins 15 and 16 with their<br>
locking lugs 43 and 44, the two locking arms 41 and 42<br>
receiving the transverse fins 15 and 16 between them.<br>
The support 40 has, as can be seen in Fig. 5, a flat<br>
base 50 which is rectangular in cross section, and on<br>
which arms 51 to 53 are formed, so that the result is<br>
an E shape; the free ends of the arms 51 to 53 are in<br>
the form shown in Fig. 4, so that three bus bars 10a,<br>
10b and 10c can be locked onto the support 40,<br>
corresponding to the number of phases.<br>
In the embodiment according to Fig. 2, a central<br>
section 30 is provided, which has a flat base section<br>
31, on which fins 32 and 33, which run perpendicularly<br>
 <br>
to it, and transverse fins 34 and 35, which are formed<br>
on them, are formed. This central section, with the<br>
base section 31, the fins 32, 33 and the transverse<br>
fins 34, 35, can be produced by extrusion, and takes<br>
the current-carrying function of the bus bar.<br>
A C-shaped screening profile 36 is associated with this<br>
central section 30, and corresponding to the screening<br>
section 19 and 20, has legs 37 and 38, which are<br>
themselves C-shaped, and are to be connected to a<br>
middle section or coupling piece 39. On the inside of<br>
the middle section 39 of the C shape, locking lugs 54<br>
and 55, behind which the base section 31 can be locked,<br>
are formed. This screening profile 36 with the locking<br>
lugs 54, 55 can also be produced by extrusion, from<br>
either aluminum or an electrically conductive plastic.<br>
In the version according to Fig. 3, a central section<br>
60 with a base section 61, on the longitudinal edges of<br>
which fins 62, 63 running perpendicularly to it are<br>
formed, is provided, transverse fins 64 and 65 in turn<br>
connecting to the free ends of the fins 62, 63. On both<br>
sides of the base section 61, C-shaped screening<br>
elements 66 and 67 corresponding to the screening<br>
elements 19 and 20 are attached, for example by the<br>
central section 60 being partly run into the screening<br>
elements 66 and 67.<br>
In the case of the versions according to Figs. 2 and 3,<br>
a good electrically conducting connection between the<br>
central section 30 and the screening element 36, or 60<br>
and the: screening elements 66, 67, is essential, so<br>
that these too can exercise their function.<br>
The length of the legs 19, 20; 37, 38; 66, 67 depends<br>
on the size of electrically conducting components which<br>
can be fixed to the central section 11, so that in<br>
every case, these electrically conducting components<br>
 <br>
are covered by the screening legs.<br>
