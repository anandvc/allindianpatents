				<td>The present invention relates to a sputtering target (which may be referred to merely as a target hereinafter), a transparent conductive oxide made of the sputtering target, and a process for producing the sputtering target.<br>
The present invention relates particularly to a target maim it possible to suppress nodules generated when sputtering is used to form a transparent conductive oxide into a film, and to make the sputtering stable, a transparent conductive oxide made of such a target, and a process for producing such a target.<br>
In recent years, display devices have been remarkably developed. Liquid crystal display devices (LCD), electroluminescence display devices (EL), field emission displays (FED) or the like are used as display devices for office machines such as personal computers and word processors, or for control systems in factories. These display devices have a sandwich structure wherein a display element is sandwiched between transparent conductive oxides.<br>
As such transparent conductive oxides, indium tin oxide (which may be referred to ITO hereinafter) formed into a fihn by sputtering, ion plating or vapor deposition accounts for the main current, as disclosed in document I: "Technology on<br><br>
Transparent Conductive Film" (published by Ohmsha Ltd., 16Â»th\ committee on transparent oxides and photoelectric materials in Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, 1999).<br>
Such ITO is made of indium oxide and tin oxide of given amounts and is characterized by having superior transparency and conductivity, being capable of being etched with a strong acid, and having good adhesion to a substrate.<br>
In the meantime, as disclosed in JP-A-3-50148, JP-A-5-155651, JP-A-5-70943, JP-A-6-234565 and so on, there is knovm a target made of indium oxide, tin oxide and zinc oxide of given amounts, or a transparent electrode made from such a target into a film (which may be referred to as IZO hereinafter). This can be etched with a weak acid, and is widely used because it has good sinterability and transparency.<br>
As described above, ITO or IZO has superior performances as the material of a transparent conductive oxide, but has a problem that when a target is used to form ITO or IZO into a film, nodules (swellings) as shown in FIG. 2 (photograph) are easily generated in the surface of the target.<br>
Particularly when an amorphous ITO film is formed to improve etching property, there arises a problem that the surface of a target is reduced because of a very small amount of water or hydrogen gas introduced into a sputtering chamber for the deposition, so that nodules are more easily generated.<br>
When such nodules are generated in the surface of the target, the nodules are easily scattered by power of plasma during the sputtering. As a result, there arises a problem that the scattered substances adhere, as alien substances, to the transparent conductive oxide during or immediately after the formation of the film.<br><br>
The nodules generated in the surface of this target account for one of causes of abnormal electric discharge.<br>
Thus, as disclosed in JP-A-8-283934, as measures for suppressing the generation of nodules in a target, efforts are made to reduce pores by making the material of the target denser through sintering at high temperature. That is, a target having a 99%-denslty relative to the theoretical density thereof is produced, but even in this case nodules cannot be completely removed.<br>
In such a situation, it is desired to develop a target making it possible to suppress the generation of nodules when a film is formed by sputtering and make the sputtering stable.<br>
Thus, the present inventors made eager investigations repeatedly to solve the above-mentioned problems . As a result, the inventors have found out that nodules generated in the surface of a target are basically the remainders of excavation and the cause for generating this remainder of excavation depends on the value (for example, 10 pm or more) of the crystal grain size of metal oxides constituting the target.<br>
Namely, in the case that a target is struck out from the surface thereof by sputtering, the speeds of the striking-out are different dependently on the directions of crystal planes so that unevenness is generated in the surface of the target. It has been proved that the size of the unevenness depends on the crystal grain size of metal oxides present in the sintered body.<br>
Therefore, it can be considered that when a target made of a sintered body having a large crystal grain size Is used, unevenness generated in the surface of the target gradually gets larger so that nodules are generated from the convex portions<br><br>
of the unevenness.<br>
That is, an object of the present invention is to provide a target making it possible to suppress nodules generated when a transparent conductive oxide is formed into a film by sputtering, and to make the sputtering stable, a transparent conductive oxide made of such a target, and a process for producing such a target.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Referring to the drawings, embodiments 1 to 8 according to present inventions (first to sixth inventions) will be specifically described hereinafter.<br>
The drawings for reference merely illustrate the sizes and the shapes of respective constituent elements and the arrangement relationship therebetween schematically to such an extent that the present inventions can be understood. Accordingly, the present inventions are not limited to illustrated examples.  In the drawings, hatching for representing sections may be omitted.<br>
[First embodiment]<br>
The first embodiment is an embodiment related to the first invention, and is a sputtering target comprising at least indium oxide and zinc oxide, wherein the atomic ratio represented by In/(ln+zn) is set to a value within the range of 0.75 to 0.97, and further, a hexagonal layered compound represented by In^OjCZnOm wherein m is an integer of 2 to 20 is contained, and the crystal grain size of the hexagonal layered compound is set to a value of 5 pm or less.<br>
(1) Composition ratio<br>
In the first embodiment, about the composition of the respective metal oxides which are constituent components of the target, it is necessary to set the atomic ratio represented by In/(In+Zn) to a value within the range of 0.75 to 0.97.<br>
This is because if the atomic ratio represented by In/(In+Zn) is less than 0.75, the conductivity of the transparent conductive oxide obtained by sputtering may drop.<br><br>
On the other hand, if the atomic ratio represented by In/( In+Zn) is over 0.97, the In content becomes large so that nodules are easily generated in the sputtering.<br>
Accordingly, the atomic ratio represented by ln/(In+Zn) is more preferably set to a value within the range of 0.80 to 0.95, and still more preferably set to a value within the range of 0.85 to 0.95 since the balance between the conductivity of the resultant transparent conductive oxide and prevention of the generation of nodules becomes better.<br>
(2) Crystal structure 1<br>
The first embodiment is characterized by containing indium oxide and zinc oxide, out of the target-constituting elements, as a hexagonal layered compound represented by In^OjCZnO)^ wherein m is an integer of 2 to 20.<br>
The reasons why indium oxide and zinc oxide are not caused to be merely present as a mixture but are incorporated in the crystal form (crystal grain size: 5 pm or less) of the hexagonal layered compound are that the target can be made dense or the density of the target can be improved, and that the conductivity of the resultant transparent conductive oxide is improved.<br>
By causing indium oxide and zinc oxide to be contained in the crystal form of the hexagonal layered compound, the crystal growth of indium oxide can be suppressed. As a result, when sputtering is performed, the generation of nodules is prevented to make it possible to make the sputtering stable.<br>
The presence of the hexagonal layered compound represented by In203(ZnO)â can be verified by X-ray diffraction analysis of crystal structure. For example, if the X-ray diffraction analysis charts shown in FIGS. 5(a)-(d) and peaks<br><br>
charts thereof are obtained, the presence of the hexagonal layered compound represented by In203(ZnO)â can be recognized.<br>
(3) Crystal structure 2<br>
CD Crystal grain size<br>
In the first embodiment, it is necessary to set the crystal grain size of the hexagonal layered compound in the target to a value of 5 pm or less.<br>
This is because if this crystal grain size is over 5 pm, nodules are very easily generated when sputtering is performed.<br>
However, if the crystal grain size is excessively small, the control may become difficult or the kinds of the raw materials which can be used may be excessively limited.<br>
Accordingly, the crystal grain size of the hexagonal layered compound in the target is more preferably set to a value within the range of 0.1 to 4 pm, and is still more preferably set to a value within the range of 0.5 to 3 pm.<br>
(2) Relationship between the size of the crystal grains and the number of generated nodules<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, the relationship between the value of the crystal grain size of the hexagonal layered compound and the number of generated nodules will be described in detail herein.<br>
The transverse axis in FIG. 3 represents the si2e (pm) of crystal grains of the hexagonal layered compound, and the vertical axis in FIG. 3 represents the number of nodules generated per unit area and unit sputtering time (/8 hours/900 mm^).<br><br>
As can easily be understood from FIG. 3, if the crystal grain size of the hexagonal layered compound is 5 iim or less, the number of the generated nodules is zero /8 hours/goo mm^. On the other hand, if the crystal grain size of the hexagonal layered compound is over 5 van, the number of the generated nodules increases rapidly and nodules, the number of which is eight to thirty two /8 hours/900 mm^, are generated.<br>
Conversely speaking, it can be understood from FIG. 3 that it is effective to set the crystal grain size of the hexagonal layered compound to 5 pm or less, in order to prevent the generation of the nodules effectively, and the generation of the nodules can surely be prevented by setting the crystal grain size to 4 Jim or less.<br>
Q) Method of measuring the crystal grain size<br>
The crystal grain size of the hexagonal layered compound can be measured, using an electron beam microanalyzer (which may be referred to as an EPMA hereinafter).<br>
More specifically, after the surface of the target is polished into a smooth face, a microscope is used to enlarge the target surface by 5,000 times. In this state, a frame of 30 pm * 30 vâ¢ is set at an arbitrary position, and then the maximum size of crystal grains in the hexagonal layered compound observed inside this frame is measured with the EPMA. At 3 or more positions, the maximum sizes of the crystal grains are measured inside the frame. The average value thereof is calculated. This value can be used as the crystal grain size of the hexagonal layered compound.<br>
This crystal grain size of the hexagonal layered compound can easily be distinguished by mapping (concentration<br><br>
distribution) of zinc with the EMPA, whereby the crystal grain size can be actually measured.<br>
Â®  Control of the crystal grain size<br>
The crystal grain size of the hexagonal layered compound can be controlled into a given range by changing appropriately the selection of the kind of ingredient powder constituting the target, the average grain size of the ingredient powder, conditions for producing the target, or the like.<br>
For example, about the kind and the average grain size of the ingredient powder, it is advisable that the average grain size of zinc oxide powder used when the target is produced is set to 2 pm or less.<br>
This is because if the average grain size of the zinc oxide powder is over 2 iim, zinc oxide diffuses and moves easily to indium oxide to make it difficult to control the crystal grain size of the formed hexagonal layered compound. Conversely speaking, if the average grain size of the zinc oxide powder is 2 vun or less, indium oxide diffuses and moves easily to zinc oxide so that the value of the crystal grain size of the hexagonal layered compound can be controlled to 5 jam or less.<br>
However, if the average grain size of the zinc oxide powder becomes excessively small, the handling thereof may become difficult. Alternatively, it becomes necessary to conduct mixing and pulverizing treatment strictly, so that costs may rise.<br>
Therefore, the average grain size of the zinc oxide powder is preferably set to a value within the range of 0.1 to 1.8 yon, is more preferably set to a value within the range of 0.3 to 1.5 Jim, and is still more preferably set to a value within the<br><br>
range of 0.5 to 1.2 \un.<br>
On the other hand, it is preferred that the average grain size of the indium oxide powder is also made substantially equal to the average grain size of the zinc oxide powder.<br>
Therefore, the average grain size of the indium oxide powder used when the target is produced is preferably set to a value within the range of 0.1 to 1.8 pm, is more preferably set to a value within the range of 0.3 to 1.5 jim, and is still more preferably set to a value within the range of 0.5 to 1.2 pm.<br>
(4)	Bulk resistance<br>
The bulk resistance of the target is preferably set to a value less than 1 x 10"^ Q â¢  cm.<br>
This is because if the bulk resistance is 1 x lO"^ Q â¢ cm or more, abnormal electric discharge is caused during sputtering so that nodules may be generated in the target surface.<br>
However, if the bulk resistance is less than 0.5 " 10"^ Q "  cm, the nature of the resultant film may be crystalline.<br>
Therefore, the bulk resistance of the target is more preferably set to a value within the range of 0.5 x 10"^ to 0.9 X 10"^ Q â  cm, and is still more preferably set to a value within the range of 0.6 x lo"^ to 0.8 x lO"^ 0 â¢  cm.<br>
(5)	Density<br>
The density of the target is preferably set to a value of 6.7 g/cm^ or more.<br>
This is because if this density is a value of less than 6.7 g/cm\ the number of generated nodules may be large.<br><br>
However, if this density is over 7.1 g/cm^, the target itself becomes metallic so that the stability of sputtering cannot be grained. As a result, a film having superior conductivity and transparency may not be obtained.<br>
Therefore, the density of the target is more preferably set to a value within the range of 6.8 to 7.0 g/cm^.<br>
[Second embodiment]<br>
The second embodiment is an embodiment related to the second invention, and is a sputtering target of the first embodiment, which comprises 67 to 93% by weight of Indium oxide, and 5 to 25% by weight of tin oxide, and 2 to 8% by weight of zinc oxide, the atomic ratio of tin to zinc being set to a value of 1 or more.<br>
(1) Composition ratio Â® Indium oxide<br>
The composition of the respective metal oxides which are constituent elements of the target in the second embodiment is characterized in that the indium oxide content by percentage is set to a value within the range of 67 to 93% by weight.<br>
This is because if the indium oxide content is less than 67% by weight, crystallization by heat treatment becomes difficult so that the conductivity of the resultant transparent conductive oxide may drop. On the other hand, if the indium oxide content is over 93% by weight, crystallization is conversely liable to advance so that the nature of the film immediately after sputtering may become crystalline.<br>
Therefore, the indium oxide content is more preferably set to a value within the range of 80 to 93% by weight, and is<br><br>
still more preferably set to a value within the range of 74 to 93% by weight since the balance between the conductivity of transparent conductive oxide and the crystallinity thereof becomes better.<br>
CD Tin oxide<br>
The tin oxide content by percentage in the target is set to a value within the range of 5 to 25% by weight.<br>
This is because If the tin oxide content is less than 5% by weight, the conductivity is not Improved even if the crystallization is advanced by heat treatment. Conversely, the conductivity of the resultant transparent conductive oxide may drop.<br>
On the other hand, if the tin oxide content is over 25% by weight, the transparent conductive film does not crystallize even by heat treatment so that the conductivity may drop and nodules may easily be generated.<br>
Therefore, the tin oxide content is more preferably set to a value within the range of 5 to 20% by weight, and is still more preferably set to a value within the range of 7 to 15% by weight since the balance between the crystallinity of the transparent conductive oxide and the conductivity plus the prevention of generation of the nodules becomes better.<br>
d) Zinc oxide<br>
The zinc oxide content by percentage in the target is set to a value within the range of 2 to 8% by weight.<br>
This Is because if the zinc oxide content is less than 2% by weight, the transparent conductive oxide obtained in sputtering crystallizes easily. Alternatively, the crystal<br><br>
grain size of the target becomes larger so that nodules may easily be generated during sputtering.<br>
On the other hand, if the tin oxide content is over 8% by weight, the transparent conductive oxide may not crystallize even by heat treatment so that the conductivity of the transparent conductive oxide may not be improved. If the tin oxide content is over 8% by weight, the bulk resistance of the target may excess 1 &gt; 10"^ Q " cm so that stable sputtering may not be attained.<br>
Therefore, the zinc oxide content is more preferably set to a value within the range of 2 to 6% by weight, and is still more preferably set to a value within the range of 3 to 5% by weight since the balance between the conductivity of the resultant transparent conductive oxide plus the bulk resistance of the target and the prevention of generation of the nodules becomes better.<br>
@ Tin/zinc<br>
Preferably, the atomic ratio of tin to all the metal atoms is substantially equal to or more than the atomic ratio of zinc to all the metal atoms. Specifically, the atomic ratio of tin to zinc is preferably set to a value of 1 or more.<br>
This is because if the atomic ratio of tin to zinc is a value of less than 1, the diffusion and movement of tin is reduced even by heat treatment so that the so-called doping effect becomes small. As a result, the conductivity of the resultant transparent conductive oxide may drop.<br>
However, if this atomic ratio of tin to zinc is excessively large, unreacted tin remains as an ionic impurity so that the conductivity may drop by the so-called ionic impurity<br><br>
scattering.<br>
Therefore, the atomic ratio of tin to zinc is preferably set to a value within the range of 2 to 10, and is still more preferably set to a value within the range of 3 to 5.<br>
Â© Ratio between percentages by weight of tin atoms and zinc atoms<br>
The value of the percentage by weight of tin atoms to all the metal atoms (Sn/(In+Sn+Zn) Â» 100) is preferably at least 3% larger than the value of the percentage by weight of zinc atoms to all the metal atoms {Zn/(In+Sn+Zn) x lOO)).<br>
This is because if the difference between these percentages (%) by weight is made larger than 3%, the doping effect of tin based on heat treatment can be effectively derived. Therefore, the conductivity of the resultant transparent conductive oxide can be effectively improved.<br>
However, if the difference between these percentages (%) by weight is excessively larger, the conductivity may drop by the above-mentioned ionic impurity scattering.<br>
Therefore, the ratio between the percentages by weight of tin atoms and zinc atoms is more preferably set to a value within the range of 4 to 30%, and is still more preferably set to a value within the range of 5 to 20%.<br>
(2) Crystal structure 1<br>
In the target of the second embodiment, indium oxide and zinc oxide are preferably contained as a hexagonal layered compound represented by the general formula: InjOj (ZnO) â wherein m is an integer of 2 to 20 in the same way as in the first embodiment.<br><br>
(3) Crystal structure 2<br>
(D Spinel structural compound<br>
The crystal structure of the second embodiment is characterized in that in the target a spinel structural compound represented by Zn^SnO, is contained instead of the hexagonal layered compound or together with the hexagonal layered compound, and the crystal grain size of the spinel structural compound is set to a value of 5 pm or less.<br>
This is because the density of the target can be made high and the conductivity thereof can be improved by causing tin oxide and zinc oxide to be present in the form of the crystal of the spinel structural compound represented by Zn^SnO^. Accordingly, by using such a target, a further improvement can be made in stability when sputtering is performed.<br>
By incorporating these hexagonal layered compound and spinel structural compound, the growth of the crystal of indium oxide is suppressed so that the whole of the sputtering target becomes fine and dense crystal texture. Thus, the conductivity of the resultant transparent conductive oxide can also be improved.<br>
Â© X-ray diffraction analysis<br>
The presence of the spinel structural compound represented by ZnjSnO^ can be verified by X-ray diffraction analysis of crystal structure.<br>
For example, if the X-ray diffraction analysis charts shown in FIGs. 6(a)-(d) and peaks charts thereof are obtained, the presence of the spinel structural compound represented by Zn^SnO^ can be recognized.<br><br>
(3) Crystal grain size<br>
The crystal grain size of the spinel structural compound is preferably set to a value of 5 jim or less. This is because if this crystal grain size is over 5 pm, nodules are remarkably liable to be generated in sputtering.<br>
However, if this crystal grain size becomes excessively small, the control may become difficult or the kinds of the raw materials which can be used may be excessively limited.<br>
Accordingly, the crystal grain size of the spinel structural compound in the target is more preferably set to a value within the range of 0.1 to 4 lam, and is still more preferably set to a value within the range of 0.5 to 3 nm.<br>
As described in the first embodiment, the crystal grain size of the spinel structural compound can easily be distinguished by mapping (concentration distribution) of zinc with the EPMA in the same manner as about the hexagonal layered compound, whereby the crystal grain size can be actually measured.<br>
@ Relationship between the value of the crystal grain size and the number of generated nodules<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, the relationship between the value of the crystal grain size of the spinel structural compound and the hexagonal layered compound and the number of generated nodules will be described in more detail herein.<br>
The transverse axis in FIG. 4 represents the value (jim) of crystal grain size in the state that the spinel structural compound and the hexagonal layered compound coexist, and the vertical axis therein represents the number of nodules generated per unit area and unit sputtering time (/8 hours/900<br><br>
mmM â¢<br>
As can easily be understood from FIG. 4, if the crystal grain size of the spinel structural compound and the hexagonal layered compound is 5 urn or less, the number of the generated nodules is 0 /8 hours/900 mm^. On the other hand, if the crystal grain size of the spinel structural compound and the hexagonal layered compound is over 5 {im, the number of the generated nodules increases rapidly and nodules, the number of which is 5 to 32 /8 hours/900 mm\ are generated.<br>
Conversely speaking, it can be understood from FIG. 4 that it is effective to set the crystal grain size of the spinel structural compound and the hexagonal layered compound to 5 yim or less, in order to prevent the generation of the nodules effectively, and the generation of the nodules can surely be prevented by setting the crystal grain size to 4 jim or less.<br>
Â© Control of the crystal grain size<br>
The crystal grain size of the spinel structural compound can be controlled into a given range by changing appropriately the selection of the kind of ingredient powder constituting the target, the average grain size of the ingredient powder, conditions for producing the target, or the like.<br>
For example, about the kind and the average grain size of the ingredient powder, it is preferred to set the average grain size of zinc oxide powder used when the target is produced to 2 iim or less, set the average grain size of tin oxide powder to a value within the range of 0.01 to 1 pm, and make the average grain size of the tin oxide powder smaller than that of the zinc oxide powder.<br>
This is because if each of the average grain sizes of the<br><br>
zinc oxide powder and the tin oxide powder is limited into such a range, diffusion and movement thereof can be controlled so that the crystal grain sizes of the hexagonal layered compound and the spinel structural compound in the target can easily be controlled (5 ]im or less).<br>
Therefore, the average grain size of the tin oxide powder is more preferably set to a value within the range of 0.02 to 0 . 5 ^m, is still more preferably set to a value within the range of 0.03 to 0.3 pm, and is most preferably set to a value within the range of 0.05 to 0.2 jim. A desired target can be obtained by producing the hexagonal layered compound and the spinel structural compound beforehand, making the compounds into desired grain sizes, and mixing them with the indiiam oxide powder.<br>
(4) Bulk resistance and density<br>
In the second embodiment, the bulk resistance of the<br>
target is preferably set to a value less than 1 x 10"^ Q â¢ cm and the density of the target is preferably set to a value of 6.7 g/cm^ or more in the same manner as in the first embodiment.<br>
[Third embodiment]<br>
The third embodiment is an embodiment related to the third invention, and is a transparent conductive oxide obtained using a sputtering target wherein the atomic ratio represented by In/(In+Zn) is set to a value within the range of 0.75 to 0.97, and further, a hexagonal layered compound represented by In^OjtZnO)^ wherein m is an integer of 2 to 20 is contained, and the crystal grain size of the hexagonal layered compound is set to a value of 5 jim or less.<br><br>
(1)	Target<br>
In the third embodiment, the used target is the same as in the first embodiment. Therefore, the target is a target wherein the atomic ratio represented by In/(In+Zn) is within the range of 0.75 to 0.97, more preferably a target wherein the atomic ratio represented by In/(In+Zn) Is within the range of 0.80 to 0.95, and still more preferably a target wherein the atomic ratio represented by In/{In+Zn) is within the range of 0.85 to 0.95.<br>
(2)	Film thickness<br>
The film thickness of the transparent conductive oxide can be appropriately selected dependently on use purpose, the material of the substrate on which the transparent conductive oxide is deposited, and so on. In general, the film thickness preferably ranges from 3 to 3,000 nm.<br>
The reasons for this are as follows. If this film thickness is less than 3 nm, the conductivity of the transparent conductive oxide is liable to be insufficient. On the other hand, if the film thickness is over 3,000 nm, the light transmittance thereof may drop or cracks or the like may easily be generated in the transparent conductive oxide when the transparent conductive oxide is deformed in or after the step of producing the transparent conductive oxide.<br>
Therefore, the film thickness of the transparent conductive oxide is preferably set to a value within the range of 5 to 1,000 nm, and is more preferably set to a value within the range of 10 to 800 nm.<br>
FIGs. 7 and 8 show effects of the film thickness on the<br><br>
resistance change rate and the light transmittance curve of the transparent conductive oxide, respectively.<br>
It Is understood from FIG. 7 that even if the film thickness of the transparent conductive oxide (substrate: PET) is changed to 68 nm (curve A), 100 nm (curve B) and 200 nm (curve C), respectively, the resistance change rates thereof hardly<br>
have difference in a 1000-hour heating test at 90Â°C.<br>
According to FIG. 8, in the case that the film thickness of IZO was changed to 100 nm (curve B), 220 nm (curve C), and 310 nm (curve D), respectively, a tendency that the light transmittance at the respective wavelengths dropped slightly if the film thickness was made larger was found out.<br>
(3) Substrate<br>
When the target is used to form the transparent conductive oxide into a film, the film is preferably formed on a substrate.<br>
Such a substrate is preferably a glass substrate or a film or sheet substrate made of a transparent resin.<br>
More specific examples of the glass substrate Include glass plates made of soda lime, lead glass, borosilicate glass, high-purity silica glass, non-alkali glass and so on.<br>
Of these glass plates, the non-alkali glass plate is more preferred since no alkali ions diffuse into the transparent conductive oxide.<br>
The transparent resin is preferably a resin having a sufficiently high light transmittance and a superior electric insulation.  Specific examples thereof include polyester resins such as polyethylene terephthalate resin, polycarbonate resin, polyarylate resin, polyether sulfone resin, acrylic resin, polyimide resin, polyamide resin, and maleimide resin.<br><br>
Of these resins, polycarbonate resin, polyarylate resin, polyethylene terephthalate resin, or polyether sulfone resin is suitably used since these resins also have heat resistance.<br>
(4)	Heat treatment<br>
In the transparent conductive oxide of the third embodiment, the conductivity thereof can be made high by heat treatment (including crystallizing treatment) after the formation Into the film.<br>
About conditions for such heat treatment, treatment time is preferably set to a value within the range of 0.5 to 3 hours in the temperature range of 180 to SOCC, preferably in the temperature range of 200 to 250Â°C.<br>
It has been proved that if such heat treatment conditions are used, the resistivity of the transparent conductive oxide Immediately after the formation into the film can be made low, for example, in a rate of 20 to 80%.<br>
(5)	Resistivity<br>
The resistivity of the transparent conductive oxide is preferably set to a value of 800 pQ * cm or less.<br>
If this resistivity exceeds 800 pQ â  cm, uses which can be applied may be excessively limited.<br>
Therefore, the resistivity of the transparent conductive oxide is more preferably set to a value of 600 pQ â¢ cm or less, and is still more preferably set to a value of 300 \iQ â¢ cm or less.<br>
(6)	Light transmittance<br>
As shown by the curve B (IZO/7059 glass) in FIG. 8, the<br><br>
light transmittance (at a wavelength of 500 nm or 550 nm) of the transparent conductive oxide is preferably a value of 75% or more, more preferably a value of 80% or more in the case that the thickness thereof is, for example, 100 nm.<br>
If the transparent conductive oxide has such a light transmittance, the transparent conductive oxide can be suitably used as transparent electrodes of various display devices such as liquid crystal display elements and electroluminescence display elements, for which high transparency and conductivity are required.<br>
The curve A in FIG. 8 is the transmittance curve of the glass substrate (7059 glass); the curve C is an example wherein an IZO film of the third embodiment, which had a thickness of 220 nm, was formed on the glass substrate; the curve D is an example wherein an IZO film of the third embodiment, which had a thickness of 310 nm, was formed on the glass substrate; and the curve E is an example wherein an ITO film, which had a thickness of 220 nm, was formed on the glass substrate.<br>
(7) Refractive index<br>
As shown by the curve B (lzo/7059 glass) in FIG. 9, the refractive index (at a wavelength of 500 nm) of the transparent conductive oxide is preferably a value of 2.5 or less in the case that the thickness thereof is, for example, 90 nm.<br>
If the transparent conductive oxide has such a low refractive index, the transparent conductive oxide can be suitably used as transparent electrodes of various display devices such as liquid crystal display elements and electroluminescence display elements, for which high transparency and anti-reflectivity are required.<br><br>
The curve A in FIG. 9 is an example wherein an IZO film of the third embodiment, which had a thickness of 30 nm, was formed on a glass substrate (7059 glass).<br>
(8)	Surface roughness (P-V value)<br>
The P-V value (according to JIS B0601) of the transparent conductive oxide, as an index for the surface roughness thereof, is preferably set to a value of 1 pm or less.<br>
If the transparent conductive oxide has such a P-V value, the generation of wire-snapping or short circuits can be effectively prevented even if the transparent conductive oxide is used as transparent electrodes of various display devices such as liquid crystal display elements and electroluminescence display elements.<br>
In the case that the surface roughness of the transparent conductive oxide is represented by other indexes , Ra (according to JIS B0601) thereof is preferably set to a value of 100 nm or less and Rz (JIS B0601) thereof is preferably set to a value of 500 nm or less.<br>
(9)	Method of forming a film<br>
When the transparent conductive oxide is formed into a film on a substrate, the following can be used: a magnetron sputtering machine, an electron beam machine, an ion plating machine, a laser ablation machine or the like. More preferably, a magnetron sputtering machine is used.<br>
About conditions for forming the film using, for example, such a magnetron sputtering machine, plasma output varies to some extent dependently on the area of the target or the film thickness of the transparent conductive oxide. However, it is<br><br>
in general preferred to set the plasma output to a value within the range of 0.3 to 4 W per cm^ of the target area and set film-forming time to a value of 5 to 120 minutes.<br>
Such film-forming conditions make it possible to obtain the transparent conductive oxide having a desired film thickness easily.<br>
(10) Uses<br>
Examples of preferred uses of the third embodiment include a transparent electrode of a liquid crystal display element, a transparent electrode of an electroluminescence element, a transparent electrode of a solar cell, a parent material when these transparent electrodes are formed by etching, an antistatic film, and an anti-icing heater for window glass.<br>
[Fourth embodiment]<br>
The fourth embodiment is an embodiment related to the fourth invention, and is a transparent conductive oxide obtained using a sputtering target of the third embodiment, which comprises 67 to 93% by weight of indium oxide, and 5 to 25% by weight of tin oxide, and 2 to 8% by weight of zinc oxide, the atomic ratio of tin to zinc being set to a value of 1 or more.<br>
(1) Target<br>
As the target used in the fourth embodiment, the same target as in the second embodiment can be used.<br>
That is, the target is a target comprising 67 to 93% by weight of indium oxide, 5 to 25% by weight of tin oxide, and<br><br>
2 to 8% by weight of zinc oxide.<br>
As the composition of the target, more preferred is a composition comprising 74 to 93% by weight of indium oxide, 5 to 20% by weight of tin oxide, and 2 to 6% by weight of zinc oxide. Still more preferred is a composition comprising 80 to 89% by weight of indium oxide, 8 to 15% by weight of tin oxide, and 3 to 5% by weight of zinc oxide.<br>
In the target used in the fourth embodiment, the value of the atomic ratio of tin atoms in tin oxide, which is a constituent component of this transparent conductive oxide, to all the metal atoms is equal to or more than the atomic ratio of zinc atoms in zinc oxide to all the metal atoms in the same manner as in the second embodiment. In short, the atomic ratio of tin to zinc is preferably set to a value of 1 or more.<br>
In the target used in the fourth embodiment, it is more preferred to use an oxide target having a form in which indium oxide and zinc oxide make a hexagonal layered compound represented by In203{ZnO)â wherein m is 2 to 20 and the hexagonal layered compound Is locally positioned in crystal of indium oxide.<br>
The value of m in the formula representing this hexagonal layered compound is 2 to 20, preferably 2 to 8, and more preferably 2 to 6.<br>
The purity of the target used in the fourth embodiment Is preferably 98% or more.<br>
If this purity is less than 98%, the chemical stability, conductivity or light transmittance of the resultant film may deteriorate by the presence of impurities.<br>
Therefore, the purity is more preferably 99% or more, and is still more preferably 99.9% or more.<br><br>
In the case of using a sintered target, the relative density (theoretical density) of this target is preferably set to 96% or more.  If this relative density is less than 96%, a drop in film-forming speed or film quality is easily caused.<br>
Therefore, the relative density of the sintered target is more preferably 9 7% or more, still more preferably 98% or more.<br>
The relative density (theoretical density) of the target is the sum value calculated from the densities of the respective raw materials and the respective added amounts (% by weight) thereof.<br>
(2) Crystallizing treatment<br>
About the transparent conductive oxide of the fourth embodiment, it is preferred to use the above-mentioned target to make the transparent conductive oxide into an amorphous film by sputtering, and subsequently crystallize the film at 230Â°C or higher.<br>
The reason why the amorphous transparent conductive oxide is formed in this way when the film is made by sputtering is that the etching property of the amorphous transparent conductive oxide is better than that of crystalline transparent conductive oxide even if the compositions of metal oxides constituting the transparent conductive oxides are the same.<br>
Next, the amorphous transparent conductive oxide is crystallized into a transparent conductive oxide. Such a transparent conductive oxide has a highly improved conductivity. Such a transparent conductive oxide has stability in electric resistance at high temperature or at high moisture, as shown in FIG. 7.<br><br>
Heat treatment temperature when the amorphous transparent conductive oxide is crystallized is more preferably a value of 250Â°C or higher, still more preferably a value of 280Â°C or higher.<br>
As this heat treatment temperature is higher, a more favorable effect is produced since crystallizing speed is faster. However, the heat treatment temperature is preferably set to a temperature which does not cause thermal deformation of the transparent substrate. Therefore, for example, in the case that a resin is used as the substrate, the heat treatment temperature is preferably set to a temperature of 250Â°C or lower. In the case that a glass substrate is used, this temperature is preferably set to a temperature of 500Â°C or lower. The crystal type obtained by the heat treatment is preferably made to blxbite type crystal of only indium oxide in light of the heat treatment temperature. This is because if the other hexagonal layered compounds or spinel structural compounds are contained, the conductivity may drop by the so-called ionic impurity scattering.<br>
Referring to FIG. 10, the effect of the crystallizing temperature will be described in more detail.<br>
The transverse axis in FIG. 10 represents heat treatment temperature (Â°C) as the crystallizing temperature, and the vertical axis therein represents resistivity (pQ " cm).<br>
As can easily be understood from FIG. 10, if the heat treatment temperature is less than 230Â°C, the value of the resistivity becomes very high, that is. 3,200 iiQ " cm. Conversely, if the heat treatment temperature is over 350Â°C, the value of the resistivity becomes high, that is, 1,000 ji Q â¢ cm.<br><br>
Conversely speaking, in order to make effectively the value of the resistivity low, for example. Into a value of 500 pQ â  cm or less, the heat treatment temperature is preferably set to a value within the range of 230 to 320Â°C, is more preferably set to a value within the range of 240 to 300Â°C, and is still more preferably set to a value within the range of 250<br>
to 290Â°C according to FIG. 10.<br>
(3) Etching treatment<br>
The transparent conductive oxide of the fourth embodiment is preferably etched to have a given shape.<br>
That is, the amorphous transparent conductive oxide made into a film by sputtering can easily be etched with, for example, an aqueous solution having a concentration of 5% by weight of oxalic acid.<br>
By making the temperature of the etching treatment high, etching property can be improved. For example, in the case that etching is performed at 40 to 50Â°C, the etching speed can be made to a value of 0.1 vim/minute or more.<br>
Accordingly, this amorphous transparent conductive oxide is characterized by being easily etched without using a strong acid such as hydrochloric acid or aqua regia as an etching solution or requiring complicated operations such as attachment of a protective film onto a wiring electrode as performed for conventional ITO films.<br>
It is particularly preferred to use, as the etching solution, an aqueous solution having a concentration of 3 to 10% by weight of oxalic acid.  If the concentration of oxalic acid in this aqueous solution is thinner than 3% by weight, sufficient etching speed may be obtained. On the other hand.<br><br>
if this concentration is over 10% by weight, crystal may be generated in the solution.<br>
It is also preferred to set the temperature of the etching solution to a value within the range of 30 to 90Â°C. This is because if the temperature of the etching solution is less than 30""C, the etching speed may excessively drop and if the temperature of the etching solution is over 90Â°C, the management of the etching solution may become difficult.<br>
Therefore, the temperature of the etching solution is more preferably set to a value within the range of 35 to 70Â°C, and is still more preferably set to a value within the range of 40 to 50Â°C.<br>
(4)	Film thickness<br>
The form of the transparent conductive oxide is not particularly limited. For example, a film form is preferred.<br>
In this case, the film thickness can be appropriately selected dependently on the use thereof, the material of the substrate on which the transparent conductive oxide is deposited, and so on. The film thickness preferably ranges from 3 to 3,000 nm in the same manner as in the third embodiment.<br>
(5)	Multilayered composite<br>
It is preferred to fit, to the transparent conductive oxide, a gas barrier layer, a hard coat layer, an antireflection layer, and the like on the substrate face opposite to the face on which the transparent conductive oxide is deposited, thereby making a multilayered composite.<br>
As the material for forming such a gas barrier layer, there is used ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer, polyvinyl alcohol.<br><br>
sputtering conditions when the transparent conductive oxide is deposited on the transparent substrate by direct sputtering vary dependently on the method of the direct sputtering, the composition of the sputtering target, the property of the used machine, and so on.  It is therefore difficult to specify the conditions without reservation. However, in the case of DC magnetron sputtering, an example of the conditions is preferably set as follows.<br>
(Vacuum degree)<br>
About the attainment vacuum degree in direct sputtering, it is preferred to reduce the pressure inside a vacuum tank beforehand Into a value of 1 x 10"^ Pa or less before the sputtering.<br>
The vacuum degree in the sputtering is preferably set to a value within the range of 1.3 x lO"^ to 6,7 Pa.<br>
The reasons for this are as follows.  If the vacuum degree in the sputtering is higher than 1.3 x lO"^ Pa, stability of plasma may deteriorate. On the other hand, if this vacuum degree is lower than 6.7 Pa, it may be difficult to raise the voltage applied to the target.<br>
Therefore, the vacuum degree in the sputtering is more preferably set into the range of 2.7 x lO"^ to 1.3 Pa, and is still more preferably set into the range of 4.0 x lO"^ to 6.7 X 10"" Pa.<br>
(Applied voltage)<br>
The voltage applied to the target in the sputtering is preferably set to a value within the range of 200 to 500 V.<br>
The reasons for this are as follows. If this applied<br><br>
voltage is less than 200 V, it may become difficult to obtain a good quality thin film or the speed of the film-formation may be restricted. On the other hand, if this applied voltage is over 500 V, abnormal electric discharge may be caused.<br>
Therefore, the voltage applied to the target in the sputtering is more preferably set to a value within the range of 230 to 450 V, and is still more preferably set to a value within the range of 250 to 420 V.<br>
(Sputtering gas)<br>
As the sputtering gas (atmospheric gas) in the sputtering, a mixed gas of an inert gas, such as argon gas, and oxygen gas is preferred. Therefore, in the case that argon gas is used as the inert gas, the blend ratio (volume ratio) of argon gas to oxygen gas is preferably set to 0.6:0.4 to 0.999:0.001.<br>
That is, the partial pressure of oxygen is preferably set to a value within the range of 1 x 10"* to 6.7 x 10"^ Pa, is more preferably set to a value within the range of 3 x 10"* to 1 x 10"^ Pa, and is still more preferably set to a value within the range of 4 x lO"* to 7 x lO"^ Pa.<br>
Outside the range of this blend ratio and this partial pressure of oxygen, the resultant transparent conductive oxide may neither have a low resistance nor a high light transmittance.<br>
(D Film-forming conditions 2<br>
In the method of depositing the transparent conductive oxide on the transparent substrate by reactive sputtering, a target made of an alloy of indium, tin and zinc is used as the sputtering target.<br><br>
This alloy target may be obtained, for example, by dispersing powder or chips of tin and zinc into melted indium, and then, cooling this dispersant.<br>
The purity of this alloy target is preferably 98% or more, more preferably 99% or more, and still more preferably 99.9% or more in the same manner as about the target for direct sputtering.<br>
Conditions for the reactive sputtering vary dependently on the composition of the sputtering target, the property of the machine used, and so on. However, the vacuum degree and voltage applied to the target in the sputtering, and substrate temperature are preferably made equivalent to the conditions for DC direct sputtering.<br>
As the atmospheric gas, a mixed gas of an inert gas, such as argon, and oxygen gas is preferred. The percentage of oxygen gas is preferably set to a value higher than that in direct sputtering.<br>
In the case that argon gas is used as the inert gas, the blend ratio (volume ratio) of argon gas to oxygen gas is preferably set to 0.5:0.5 to 0.99:0.01.<br>
(7) Uses<br>
Since the transparent conductive oxide of the fourth embodiment has the above-mentioned properties, the transparent conductive oxide is suitable for a transparent electrode of a liquid crystal display element, a transparent electrode of an electroluminescence element, a transparent electrode of a solar cell, a parent material when these transparent electrodes are formed by etching, an antistatic film, an anti-icing heater for window glass, or the like.<br><br>
[Fifth embodiment]<br>
The fifth embodiment is an embodiment related to the fifth invention, and is a transparent conductive oxide of the third or fourth embodiment, wherein the half band width of a binding energy peak of the oxygen IS orbit, which is measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), is set to 3 eV or less.<br>
(1) Half band width of a binding energy peak of the oxygen IS orbit<br>
The transparent conductive oxide of the fifth embodiment can be obtained by using the target of the first to the second embodiments and forming a film by sputtering.<br>
The half band width of a binding energy peak of the oxygen IS orbit in the surface of the transparent conductive oxide, which is measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), is preferably set to 3 eV or less.<br>
This is because if this half band width is over 3 eV, initial connection resistivity may become large or connection resistance during long-term use may increase markedly.<br>
However, if this half band width is 1 eV or less, the range for selecting raw materials which can be used may be excessively limited or the control of the half band width may be difficult.<br>
Therefore, this half band width is more preferably set to a value within the range of 1 to 2.9 eV, and is still more preferably set to a value within the range of 2.0 to 2.8 eV.<br>
The reason why the half band width of the binding energy peak of the oxygen IS orbit is limited into the given range in this way is based on the following finding.<br>
That is, when the surface state of the transparent<br><br>
conductive oxide formed into a film by sputtering is measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), two peaks make their appearance, one thereof being a peak originating from its metal oxide, and the other thereof being a peak originating from its element other than the metal-oxygen-the metal, for example, hydrogen or carbon bonds as shown in FIG. 13. In the case that the transparent conductive oxide wherein the peak originating from the bonds of the element other than the metal-oxygen-the metal, that is, the binding energy peak of the oxygen IS orbit is relatively large is connected to an external electric circuit such as a liquid crystal driving circuit, the connection resistance thereof may increase or during long-term use thereof the connection resistance may increase.<br>
Thus, in the fifth embodiment, the half band width of the binding energy peak of the oxygen IS orbit in the surface of the transparent conductive oxide, which is measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), is set to the given value. In this way, the initial connection resistance is reduced and further the tendency of a gradual increase in the connection resistance in long-term use is suppressed.<br>
(2) Measurement method<br>
The half band width of the binding energy peak of the oxygen IS orbit in the surface of the transparent conductive oxide can be calculated from the oxygen IS orbit peak and the base line thereof.<br>
That is, the binding energy peeik of the oxygen IS orbit can be obtained as one oxygen IS orbit peak, as shown in FIG. 12, using an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS).<br>
Next, in the resultant oxygen IS orbit peak, the base line<br><br>
thereof can be set up using Shirley"s equation. Since the length from this base line to the peak can be obtained, the position in the middle of the length can be set.<br>
Next, in the set position in the middle of the length, the binding energy width of the oxygen is orbit can be actually measured. Therefore, this energy width can be defined as the half band width.<br>
(3) Control of the half band width<br>
CD Water content in a vacuum tank<br>
The half band width of the binding energy peak of the oxygen IS orbit of the transparent conductive oxide, which is measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, can easily be controlled by the water content in a vacuum tank at the time of sputtering.<br>
That is, in order to obtain the transparent conductive oxide having a half band width of 3 eV or less, the water content in the vacuum tank is preferably set to a value within the range of 1 X 10"^ to 1 &gt;" 10"" Pa when the film thereof is formed by sputtering.<br>
More preferably, sputtering is performed while the water content in the vacuum tank is kept within the range of 1 x lO"* to 1 X 10"" Pa.<br>
(2) Applied voltage<br>
Vfhen the film of the transparent conductive oxide is formed by sputtering, the half band width of the transparent conductive oxide can be controlled by the voltage applied to the sputtering target.<br>
For exeimple, the applied voltage is preferably set to a<br><br>
value within the range of 200 to 500 V in the same manner as in the fourth embodiment.<br>
(S) Sputtering gas<br>
In order to control the half band width of the transparent conductive oxide easily into the given range, a mixed gas of an inert gas, such as argon gas, and oxygen gas is preferably used as the sputtering gas (atmospheric gas).<br>
In the case that argon gas is used as the inert gas in the mixed gas, the blend ratio of argon gas to oxygen gas is preferably set to a value of 0.6:0.4 to 0.999:0.001.<br>
When such a mixed gas is used, the conductivity of the resultant transparent conductive oxide becomes good. Moreover, the resultant transparent conductive oxide can have a high light transmittance.<br>
(4) Substrate<br>
As the substrate used when the transparent conductive oxide is formed, a glass substrate or a film or sheet substrate made of a transparent resin is preferred.<br>
Examples of the glass substrate include transparent glass plates made of soda lime, lead glass, borosilicate glass, high-purity silica glass, non-alkali glass and so on. Of these glass plates, the non-alkali glass plate is more preferred since no alkali ions diffuse into the transparent conductive oxide.<br>
The transparent resin is preferably a resin having a sufficiently high light transmittance and a superior electric insulation.  Specific examples thereof include polyester resins such as polyethylene terephthalate, polycarbonate resin, polyarylate resin, polyether sulfone resin, acrylic resin.<br><br>
polyimide resin, polyamlde resin, and malelmlde resin.<br>
The light transmlttance of the transparent substrate use^ herein is 70% or more, preferably 80% or more, and more preferably 90% or more In either case of the transparent glass substrate or the substrate made of transparent resin.<br>
The thickness of the transparent substrate is appropriately selected dependently on the use of the transparent conductive oxide or the material thereof. The thickness is usually set to a value within the range of 15 pm to 3 mm, and is preferably set to a value within the range of 50 iim to 1 ram.<br>
(5) Intermediate layer<br>
In the fifth embodiment, an intermediate layer having a thickness of 0 . 5 to 10 jim is preferably disposed on the substrate surface at the side on which the transparent conductive oxide is disposed, in order to improve adhesion thereof to the transparent conductive oxide.<br>
As this intermediate layer, there is suitably used a layer composed of a monolayer structure or a multilayer structure, which is made of a metal oxide (which may be a silicon oxide), a metal nitride (which may be a silicon nitride), a metal carbide (which may be a silicon carbide), a crosslinking resin or the like.<br>
Examples of the metal oxide Include AljOj, SiO,, (0<x zno and tio examples of the metal nitride include ain si3n4 tin. exeimples carbide sic b4c. crosslinking resin epoxy phenoxy ether acrylic resin.></x>
In the case that the substrate made of a transparent resin<br><br>
is used as such an intermediate layer, its form preferably has a bilayer structure wherein a crosslinklng layer and an inorganic material layer are successively deposited.<br>
In the case that a transparent glass material is used as the transparent substrate, its form preferably has a bilayer structure wherein an inorganic material layer and a crosslinklng resin layer are successively deposited. This Is because such a bilayer structure causes a further improvement in the adhesion than a monolayer structure.<br>
In either case, the transparent conductive oxide having better thermal stability can be obtained if the inorganic material layer is arranged on the side which the transparent conductive oxide of the intermediate layer contacts.<br>
In the case that the crosslinklng layer is disposed as the intermediate layer on the surface of the substrate made of the transparent resin, an adhesive layer or a gas barrier layer may be interposed between the substrate surface and the crosslinklng resin layer. Examples of an adhesive agent used to form such an adhesive layer include epoxy-type, acrylurethane-type, and phenoxyether-type adhesive agents. In the case that this transparent conductive material is used as a transparent electrode of a liquid crystal display element, the gas barrier layer makes it possible to prevent water vapor, oxygen or the like to diffuse into the liquid crystal.<br>
(6) Transparent conductive oxide Â® Etching<br>
The transparent conductive oxide of the fifth embodiment is amorphous, and has superior etching property. Accordingly, this amorphous transparent conductive oxide can easily be<br><br>
etched without using a strong acid such as hydrochloric aclct or aqua regia as an etching solution or requiring complicated operations, such as attachment of a protective film onto a wiring electrode, as performed for conventional ITO films.<br>
It is preferred to use, as the etching solution for this amorphous transparent conductive oxide, an aqueous solution having a concentration of 3 to 10% by weight of oxalic acid, which does not cause corrosion of wiring electrodes of display devices.<br>
The reasons for this are as follows. If the concentration of oxalic acid In the aqueous solution Is thinner than 3% by weight, sufficient etching speed may not be obtained. On the other hand, if the concentration of oxalic acid in the aqueous solution is over 10% by weight, crystal may easily be generated in the solution.<br>
(2) Heat treatment<br>
It is preferred to pattern the amorphous transparent conductive oxide by etching and subsequently crystallize the oxide by heat treatment, thereby improving the conductivity and further stabilizing the electric resistance at high temperature and high humidity.<br>
In this case, the heat treatment temperature for the crystallization is preferably set to a value of 230Â°C or higher, is more preferably set to a value of 250""C or higher, and is still more preferably set to a value of 280Â°C or higher.<br>
As the heat treatment temperature Is higher, a more favorable effect is generally produced since crystallizing speed Is faster. However, the heat treatment temperature is preferably set to a temperature at which the substrate is<br><br>
thermally deformed, or lower. For example, in the case that a transparent resin is used as the substrate, the heat treatment<br>
temperature is preferably set to a temperature of 250Â°C or lower. In the case that a glass substrate is used, the heat treatment<br>
temperature is preferably set to a temperature of SOO^C or lower.<br>
(3) Film thickness<br>
The thickness of the transparent conductive oxide can be appropriately selected dependently on the use thereof, the material of the substrate on which the transparent conductive oxide is deposited, and so on. The film thickness preferably ranges from 3 to 3,000 nm in the same manner as in the third embodiment or the forth embodiment.<br>
Â® Uses<br>
Such a transparent conductive oxide can be suitably used as a transparent electrode for a liquid crystal display element, a transparent electrode for an electroluminescence element, a transparent electrode for a solar cell, or the like to make good use of superior transparency, conductivity and etching property.<br>
[Six embodiment]<br>
The sixth embodiment is an embodiment related to the sixth invention, and Is a transparent conductive oxide formed on a colored layer disposed on a substrate. This embodiment will be described by way of an example of a color filter.<br>
(1) Structure<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 11(d), the color filter of the sixth<br><br>
embodiment is a color filter made by depositing, on a substrate 10, an organic colored layer 12 and a transparent conductive film (electrode) 24 in this order. The organic colored layer 12 is composed of RGB pixels (red pixels, green pixels and blue pixels) 14, 16andl8, and a black matrix (light shading layer) 20 disposed therebetween.<br>
This color filter is a color filter which comprises 67 to 93%, preferably 74 to 93% by weight of indium oxide, 5 to 25%, preferably 5 to 20% by weight of tin oxide, and 2 to 8%, preferably 2 to 6% by weight of zinc oxide; has a composition that the atomic ratio of tin to all metal atoms is not less than the atomic ratio of zinc to all the atoms; and has the transparent conductive film 24 crystallized as an electrode by heat-treating a transparent conductive film 22, which is eimorphous when deposited, at a temperature of 200Â°C or higher, more preferably at a temperature within the range of 230 to 300Â°C.<br>
(2) Transparent conductive film<br>
The reason why the composition of the transparent conductive oxide constituting the transparent conductive film is set into the above-mentioned range is that the sintered body target made of the transparent conductive oxide having this composition range makes sputtering at low temperature possible.<br>
That is, by forming a transparent conductive film from the sintered body using sputtering, the transparent conductive film which is amorphous and superior in etching property can be formed on the organic colored layer even if the temperature of the substrate is set to 200Â°C or lower.<br>
Therefore, a fear that the organic colored layer as an undercoat is damaged In the sputtering is relieved.<br><br>
The thickness of this transparent conductive film preferably ranges from 3 to 3,000 nm as described about the first embodiment.<br>
(3)	Substrate<br>
Examples of the substrate used in the color filter include films and sheets made of glass or synthetic resins superior in transparency, such as polycarbonate, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyarylate, and polyethersulfone.<br>
(4)	Colored layer<br>
The organic colored layer disposed over the substrate may directly be formed on the substrate, or pixels of the organic colored layer may be separated from each other in plan and further light shading layer is disposed therebetween (black matrix).<br>
Next, in this organic colored layer disposed on the substrate or adjacently to the light shading layer, a composition made of a coloring agent and a binder resin is used.<br>
Exeimples of this coloring agent which can be used include perylene pigments, lake pigments, azo pigments, quinacrldon pigments, anthraquinone pigments, anthracene pigments, isoindoline pigments, isoindollnone pigments, phthalocyanine pigments, triphenylmethane basic dyes, indanthrone pigments, indophenol pigments, cyanine pigments, and dioxadine pigments.<br>
The binder resin is preferably a resin having heat resistance. There is suitably used, for example, epoxy resin, urethane resin, urea resin, acrylic resin, polyvinyl alcohol resin, polyimide resin, or a mixture thereof. Of these resins, polyimide is particularly preferred since It has high heat<br><br>
resistance.<br>
Furthermore, the kind of the above-mentioned light shading layer is not particularly limited if it prevents interaction between the organic colored layer pieces. For exeunple, a layer made of a chromium film, a partially-oxidized chromium film, an organic colored layer colored into black or the like is suitably used.<br>
(5) Forming Method<br>
(D Formation of the colored layer<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 11(b), in order to form the organic colored layer 12, it is preferred to blend and disperse respective pigments in red, blue and green, which are selected from the above-mentioned coloring agents, and a binder resin in a solvent for them, thereby producing a paste, and subsequently form RGB pixels by photolithography.<br>
For example, it is advisable to apply the paste onto a substrate or a light shading layered worked into a stripe, semi-cure the paste, form a green organic colored layer (G pixels) in the form of a stripe corresponding to the pixels by photolithography, and then cure this.<br>
Red and blue organic colored layers (R pixels and B pixels) may also be formed in the same manner.<br>
If necessary, a protective layer made of polyimide resin may be formed on this organic colored layer.<br>
(2) Formation of the amorphous transparent conductive film<br>
Next, the amorphous transparent conductive film is formed on the organic colored layer or on the protective layer deposited on this organic colored layer, as illustrated in FIG.<br><br>
11(c).<br>
Preferably, this amorphous transparent conductive film is formed, using a target having a composition of 67 to 93%, preferably 74 to 93% by weight of indium oxide, 5 to 25%, preferably 5 to 20% by weight of tin oxide, and 2 to 8%, preferably 2 to 6% by weight of zinc oxide, wherein the atomic ratio of tin to all metal atoms is not less than the atomic ratio of zinc to all the atoms and further the crystal grain size of a contained hexagonal layered compound is 5 pm or less.<br>
Vfhen the transparent conductive film is formed on the organic colored layer or the protective layer, a magnetron sputtering machine is suitably used.<br>
Therefore, conditions when the amorphous transparent conductive film is formed vary to some extent dependently on the area or the thickness of the target. The amorphous transparent conductive film having a desired thickness can be usually obtained by setting plasma output into the range of 0.3 to 4 W per cm^ of the target area and setting forming time to a value of 5 to 120 minutes.<br>
The thickness of the amorphous transparent conductive film, which varies dependently on the kind of a display device to which the film is applied, usually ranges from 3 to 3,000 nm, preferably ranges from 20 to 600 nm, and more preferably ranges from 30 to 200 nm.<br>
d) Etching of the amorphous transparent conductive film<br>
In etching property, the resultant amorphous transparent conductive film is far better than any crystalline transparent conductive film. Therefore, in etching treatment for patterning, there can be used an aqueous solution of a weak acid<br><br>
which does not cause corrosion of wiring material, for example, an aqueous solution having an oxalic acid concentration of 3 to 10% by weight.<br>
For example, under conditions of 40 to 50Â°C using a solution having an oxalic acid concentration of 5% by weight as an etching solution, the amorphous transparent conductive film has such a superior etching property that the etching speed is 0.1 pra/minute or more.<br>
Â® Crystallization of the transparent conductive film<br>
Next, the formed amorphous transparent conductive film is preferably subjected to heat treatment so as to be crystallized after the patterning of the film by the etching, as illustrated in FIG. 11(d).  In this way, a crystalline transparent conductive film having superior heat resistance and moisture resistance is prepared.<br>
Preferably, the heat treatment condition in this case is set to 200Â°C or higher, preferably 230Â°C or higher, and more preferably 250Â°C or higher, and treatment time is set to a value of 0.5 to 3 hours.<br>
[Seventh embodiment]<br>
The seventh embodiment is an embodiment related to a process for producing the first and second inventions, and is a first process for producing a sputtering target containing a hexagonal layered compound represented by Inj03(ZnO)â wherein m is an integer of 2 to 20, the crystal grain size of the hexagonal layered compound being a value of 5 pm or less. This process is a process for producing the sputtering target, comprising the steps (1) to (3):<br><br>
(1)	the step of blending indium oxide powder with zinc oxide powder having an average grain size of 2 pm or less,<br>
(2)	the step of making a formed body wherein the atomic ratio of ln/(In+Zn) is within the range of 0.75 to 0.97, and<br>
(3)	the step of sintering the formed body at a temperature of 1,400^0 or higher.<br>
(1) Blending step (D Mixing pulverizer<br>
Respective metal oxides used as ingredients for producing the target are homogenously mixed and pulverized using an ordinary mixing pulverizer, such as a wet ball mill, bead mill, or an ultrasonic device.<br>
Â® Average grain size of the ingredient powders<br>
In the mixing and pulverizing the ingredient powders, the powders are preferably pulverized into finer grains since the crystal grain size of the hexagonal layered compound in the target is easily controlled (5 iim or less). Specifically, the indium oxide powder, the zinc oxide power and so on are preferably subjected to mixing pulverization in the manner that the average grain size thereof will be 2 pm or less, more preferably within the range of 0.1   to 1.8  [2m, still more preferably within the range of 0.3 to 1.5 \im.   and still more and more preferably within the range of 0.5 to 1.2 \im.<br>
In the meantime, in the case that tin oxide powder is blended to generate a spinel structural compound, the average grain size of the tin oxide powder is preferably set to a value within the range of 0.01 to 1 v&gt;m, is more preferably set to a value within the range of 0.1 to 0.7 pm, and is still more<br><br>
preferably within the range of 0.3 to 0.5 jim.<br>
This is because by limiting the average grain size of the tin oxide powder into such a range, the crystal grain size of the hexagonal layered compound and the spinel compound in the target can easily be controlled (5 pm or less).<br>
d) Kind of the ingredient powders<br>
The indium compound and the zinc compound used as the Ingredients are preferably oxides or compounds which will be oxides after sintering, that is, indium oxide precursors or zinc oxide precursors.<br>
Examples of the Indium oxide precursors and the zinc oxide precursors include sulfides, sulfates, nitrates, halides (chlorides, bromides and so on), carbonates, organic acid salts (acetates, oxalates, propionates, naphthanoates and so on), alkoxide compounds (methoxide compounds, ethoxlde compounds, and so on), and organic metal complexes (acetyl acetonate compounds and so on) of indium and zinc.<br>
Of these, nitrates, organic acid salts, alkoxides and organic metal complexes are preferred since they are completely thermally decomposed even at low temperature so that no impurities remain.<br>
(2) Pre-sintering step<br>
Next, this mixture is preferably pre-sintered, which is an optional step, after the mixture of the indium compound, the zinc compound and the tin compound is obtained.<br>
In this pre-sintering step, heat treatment is preferably performed at 500 to 1,200""C for 1 to 100 hours.<br>
This is because the thermal decomposition of the Indium<br><br>
compound, the zinc compound and the tin compound may become insufficient under the heat treatment condition at less than 500Â°C or for less than 1 hour. On the other hand, if the heat treatment condition is over 1,200Â°C or over 100 hours, the grain may be made coarse and large-sized.<br>
It is therefore particularly preferred to perform the heat treatment (pre-sintering) under the conditions of the<br>
temperature range of 800 to 1,200Â°C for 2 to 50 hours.<br>
The pre-sintered body obtained herein is preferably pulverized before being formed and sintered. The pulverization of the pre-sintered body is preferably performed with a ball mill, a roll mill, a pearl mill, a jet mill or the like, in the manner that the grain size thereof will be from 0.01 to 1.0 Jim.<br>
(3)	Forming step<br>
Next, the resultant pre-sintered body is used to be formed into a shape suitable for a target in the forming step.<br>
For such forming processing, mold forming, casting forming, injection forming or the like is performed.  In order to obtain a sintered body having a high sintered density, it is preferred to form the pre-sintered body by CIP {cold isostatic press) or the like, and subsequently subject the resultant formed body to sintering treatment, which will be described after.<br>
In the forming processing, a forming aid such as polyvinyl alcohol, methyl cellulose, polywax or oleic acid may be used.<br>
(4)	Sintering step<br>
Next, the resultant fine powder is granulated and then<br><br>
formed into a desired shape by press forming, and the formed body is sintered and subjected to HIP (hot isostatic press) sintering or the like.<br>
About sintering conditions in this case, the sintering is performed in the atmosphere of oxygen gas or pressured oxygen gas, usually at 1,400 to Leoo^C, preferably at 1,430 to 1,550Â°C, and more preferably at 1,500 to 1,540Â°C for 30 minutes to 72 hours, preferably for 10 to 48 hours.<br>
In the meantime, if the mixture of the indium oxide power and the zinc oxide powder is sintered in the atmosphere containing no oxygen or is sintered at a temperature of less than 1,400Â°C, the reactivity of zinc oxide with indium oxide drops so that crystal of a hexagonal layered compound may be insufficiently formed. Consequently, the density of the resultant target cannot be sufficiently improved so that the generation of nodules cannot be sufficiently suppressed in the sputtering.<br>
The temperature-raising rate in this case is preferably<br>
from 10 to 50Â°C/minute.<br>
If the mixture of the indium oxide powder and the zinc oxide powder having the given ratio therebetween is sintered in the atmosphere of oxygen gas or pressured oxygen gas at a<br>
temperature of 1,400Â°C or higher in this way, crystal of the hexagonal layered compound made of indium oxide and zinc oxide is generated to be unevenly distributed in gaps between the crystal grains of indium oxide. This suppresses crystal growth of indium oxide so that a sintered body having a fine crystal texture is formed.<br>
In the above-mentioned blending step, at least zinc oxide having an average grain size of 2 VÂ«TI or less is used; therefore.<br><br>
the sintered body having a crystal grain size of 5 nm or less is obtained.<br>
(5)	Reducing step<br>
In order to make the bulk resistance of the resultant sintered body uniform as a whole, reducing treatment is preferably performed in a reducing step, which is an optional step.<br>
As such a reducing method, there is used a method based on reducing gas, or reduction based on vacuum sintering or an inert gas.<br>
In the case based on the reducing gas, hydrogen, methane, carbon monoxide, a mixed gas of these gases and oxygen, or the like may be used.<br>
In the case of the reduction based on sintering in the inert gas, nitrogen, argon, a mixed gas of these gases and oxygen, or the like may be used.<br>
Reduction temperature is from 100 to 800Â°C, preferably from 200 to SOO^C. Reduction time is from 0.01 to 10 hours, preferably from 0.05 to 5 hours.<br>
(6)	Working step<br>
Preferably, the sintered body obtained by such sintering is cut into a shape suitable for being fitted to a sputtering machine in a working step, and a fitting member is attached to the cut body to prepare a sputtering target.<br>
In the sputtering target obtained in the last step, the composition of the respective metal oxides, which are constituent elements of the target, is set into the above-mentioned range, and grains having a size of 2 vwn or less are<br><br>
used to sinter the oxides in the atmosphere of oxygen gas or pressured oxygen gas at a temperature of 1,400Â°C or higher, thereby causing Indium oxide and zinc oxide to be present in the form of hexagonal layered compound crystal. Therefore, the bulk resistance of this target is reduced and the target has a fine crystal texture having a crystal grain size of 5 )im or less.<br>
Accordingly, when this target is used to form a film by sputtering, the generation of nodules is suppressed. Since the scattering of the nodules by plasma is markedly reduced, the sputtering can be made stable so that a high-quality transparent conductive oxide to which no alien substances are attached can be obtained.<br>
[Eighth embodiment]<br>
The eighth embodiment is related to another process for producing the first and second inventions, and is a second process for producing a sputtering target containing a hexagonal layered compound represented by InjOaCZnO)^ wherein m is an integer of 2 to 20, the crystal grain size of the hexagonal layered compound being a value of 5 pm or less. This process is a process for producing the sputtering target, characterized by comprising the steps (1) to (5):<br>
(1)	the step of producing a hexagonal layered compound represented by InP3{ZnO)â wherein m is an Integer of 2 to 20,<br>
(2)	the step of adjusting the produced hexagonal layered compound to have a grain size of 5 ]im or less,<br>
(3)	the step of blending the hexagonal layered compound having the adjusted grain size with indium oxide powder,<br>
(4)	the step of making a formed body wherein the atomic<br><br>
ratio of In/(In+Zn} is within the range of 0.75 to 0.97, and (5) the step of sintering the formed body at a temperature<br>
of 1,400Â°C or higher.<br>
If the sputtering target is produced in this way, the average grain size of the hexagonal layered compound and so on in the target can be very strictly adjusted. Therefore, the generation of nodules can be effectively prevented when the target is used to perform sputtering.<br>
(1)	Step of producing a hexagonal layered compound<br>
When a hexagonal layered compound represented by InjOaCZnO)^ wherein m is an integer of 2 to 20 is produced, it is preferred to use a wet ball mill, a bead mill, or an ultrasonic device to mix homogeneously respective powders of indium oxide (In^Oj) and zinc oxide (ZnO), which are ingredients, in the same manner as in the seventh embodiment.<br>
Next, the mixture is preferably subjected to heat<br>
treatment at a temperature of 1200 to 1300Â°C for 30 minutes to 3 hours when the hexagonal layered compound is obtained.<br>
Since the average grain size of the hexagonal layered compound is controlled in the grain size adjusting step which will be described later. Indium oxide powder and zinc oxide powder having an average grain size of 2 pm or less are not necessarily necessary in the step of producing the hexagonal layered compound.<br>
(2)	Step of adjusting the grain size of the hexagonal layered<br>
compound<br>
This is a step of making the average grain size of the produced hexagonal layered compound to a value of 5 pm or less.<br><br>
By adjusting the grain size of the hexagonal layered compound in this way, the generation of nodules can be effectively prevented when the resultant target is used.<br>
However, if the average grain size of the hexagonal layered compound is made excessively small, the control thereof may become difficult or the yield may drop to result in economical disadvantages. Therefore, the average grain size of the hexagonal layered compound is more preferably set to a value within the range of 0.1 to 4 \m,  and is still more preferably set to a value within the range of 0.5 to 3 urn.<br>
The method of adjusting the grain size of the hexagonal layered compound is not particularly limited. However, the adjustment can be carried out by pulverizing the compound homogeneously in, for example, a wet ball mill, a bead mill, or an ultrasonic device and then sieving the resultant grains.<br>
(3)	Step of blending indium oxide powder<br>
This is a step of blending the hexagonal layered compound having the adjusted grain size with indium oxide powder.<br>
That is, the indium oxide powder is preferably blended in the manner that the atomic ratio of In/(In+Zn) will be within the range of 0.75 to 0.97 in the formed body.<br>
It is also preferred to add a spinel compound together with the indium oxide powder. That is, it is also preferred to subject zinc oxide (ZnO) and tin oxide (SnOj) to heat treatment at a temperature of 800 to 1200""C for 30 minutes to 3 hours, subsequently adjust the grain size thereof to 5 pm or less, and perform the addition at this stage.<br>
(4)	Step of making a formed body<br><br>
The conditions in this step are preferably made to the, same as in the seventh embodiment. That is, in order to obtain a dense target, it is preferred to make a formed body beforehand by CIP (cold isostatic press) or the like.<br>
(5) Sintering step<br>
The conditions in this step are preferably made to the same as in the seventh embodiment. That is, it is preferred to sinter the formed body obtained in (4) in the atmosphere of<br>
oxygen gas or pressured oxygen gas at 1,400 to l,6aoÂ°C for 30 minutes to 72 hours.<br>
Examples<br>
The present invention will be described in more detail by way of Examples and Comparative Examples.<br>
[Example 1]<br>
(1) Production and evaluation of a sputtering target<br>
(D Production of a target<br>
Indium oxide having an average grain size of 1 iim and zinc oxide having an average grain size of 1 \m. as ingredients, were blended with each other in the manner that the atomic ratio of In/(In+Zn) would be 0.83, and this was supplied to a wet ball mill, and mixed and pulverized for 72 hours to yield fine ingredient powder.<br>
The fine ingredient powder was subjected to granulation, and subsequently the resultant grains were press-formed into a size having a diameter of 10 cm and a thickness of 5 mm. This was put into a firing furnace and fired in pressured oxygen gas at 1,450Â°C for 36 hours to yield a sintered body (target) made<br><br>
of the transparent conductive material.<br>

[Example   26]<br>
(1)   Formation of  an organic  colored layer on  a  substrate<br>
A glass substrate was used as a substrate to form a light shading layer made of chromium oxide on a surface thereof.    The<br><br>
formation of the light shading layer was performed by sputtering, and the thickness of the chromium oxide layer was set to 0.1 um.<br>
Next, the light shading layer was worked into the form of a lattice having a line width of 30 iim by photolithography. The pitch thereof along one direction was 110 pm, and the pitch thereof along the direction perpendicular thereto was 330 pm.<br>
Next, a phthalocyanine green pigment (Color Index No 74160 Pigment Green 36) was used as a green pigment, and a paste wherein it was dispersed in and mixed with a transparent polyimide precursor solution Semicofine SP-910 (made by Toray Industries, Inc.) was applied to the chromium oxide layer in the lattice form. This was semi-cured to form a green organic colored layer in the form of stripe having a width of 90 pm and a pitch of 330 jim, which corresponded to pixels. Thereafter, this was cured. The thickness of this green organic colored layer was set to 1.5 pm.<br>
As a red pigment, a quinacridon pigment (Color Index No 73905 Pigment Red 209) was used, and as a blue pigment, a phthalocyanine blue pigment (Color Index No 74160 Pigment Blue 15-4) was used. From pastes obtained by dispersing/mixing these in/with the above-mentioned polyimide precursor solutions, respectively, a red organic colored layer and a blue organic colored layer were formed in the same way as above.<br>
By applying the above-mentioned polyimide precursor solution onto these organic colored layers and curing the applied layer, a protective layer having a thickness of 2 pm was formed.<br>
(2) Formation of a transparent conductive film<br><br>
A transparent conductive film (transparent conductive oxide film) was formed on the organic colored layers of the glass substrate having the organic colored layers obtained in the above-mentioned (1) by sputtering.<br>
A sputtering target used herein was produced as follows. That is, a mixture of 80% by weight of indium oxide powder, 15% by weight of tin oxide powder and 5% by weight of zinc oxide was mixed and pulverized in a wet ball mill. Thereafter, the resultant was subjected to granulation, and the grains were press-formed. The resultant was sintered in pressured oxygen<br>
gas in a firing furnace at 1,450Â°C for 36 hours to yield a target [A6] having a crystal grain size of 4.0 pm.<br>
The resultant target [A6] was fitted to the DC magnetron sputtering machine, and then a transparent conductive film was formed on the organic colored layer of the glass substrate by sputtering.<br>
About sputtering conditions in this case, argon gas into which an appropriate amount of oxygen gas was incorporated was used as atmosphere, and sputtering pressure, attainment pressure, substrate temperature, applied electric power, and film-forming time were 3 x 10"^ Pa, 5 " 10"^ Pa, 25Â°C, 100 W, and 20 minutes, respectively.<br>
As a result thereof, a transparent conductive film having a film thickness of about 120 nmwas formed on the organic colored layer.<br>
The crystallinity of this transparent conductive film was observed by X-ray diffraction analysis. As a result, it was proved that the film was amorphous.<br>
Substrate temperature was set to 180Â°c at the time of sputtering to form a transparent conductive film on the organic<br><br>
colored layer of another glass substrate. This transparent conductive film was also amorphous.<br>
The ingredient composition and physical properties of the transparent conductive film are shown in Table 11.<br>
(3)	Evaluation of the etching property of the transparent<br>
conductive film<br>
The etching property of the resultant transparent conductive film was evaluated.<br>
That is, parts of the transparent conductive film formed on the organic colored layer were etched at 40Â°C with an aqueous solution containing an oxalic acid concentration of 5% by weight, and then a section in the boundary portion between etched portions and non-etched portions was observed with an electron microscope.<br>
As a result, it was found out that no transparent conductive film remained in the etched portions, and the edge portion of the transparent conductive film remaining in the non-etched portions had a sectional shape inclined smoothly toward the etched portions.<br>
Thus, it was proved that the resultant transparent conductive film had good workability even in etching using a weak acid.<br>
When the etching workability of this transparent conductive film was evaluated, evaluation criteria described in Example 4 were adopted. The evaluation results are shown in Table 2.<br>
(4)	Crystallization of the transparent conductive film by heat<br>
treatment<br><br>
Next, the transparent conductive film formed on the organic colored layer of the glass substrate and obtained in the above-mentioned (2) was subjected to heat treatment.<br>
About heat treatment conditions in this case, the film was heated to 230Â°C at a temperature-rising rate of 20Â°C/minute in the atmosphere of argon gas. The time for keeping 230Â°C was set to 1 hour.<br>
The transparent conductive film subjected to this heat treatment was crystalline, and the resistivity thereof measured by a four-probe method was 230 x 10"* Q â¢ cm.<br>
Furthermore, about the transparency of this transparent conductive oxide film, the light transmittance about light having a wavelength of 500 nmwas 82% according to a spectrometer. Thus, the transparency was also superior.<br>
Bad effects by this heat treatment, such as thermal deterioration of the organic colored layer, were not observed.<br>
