DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the invention, a master blend binder for use in construction materials is provided which is particularly useful in areas where water resistance is an important consideration, such as for backer boards for baths and showers, floor underlay applications and exterior sheathing boards.   Further uses of the inventive binder are for materials such as fiberboard, siding, trim boards, strucmral framing, self-leveling floors, road patching materials, fire-proofmg sprays, and fire-stopping materials.<br><br>
A master blend binder according to the invention preferabl includes about 20 wt. % to about 75 wt. % calcium sulfate beta-hemihydn (i.e., beta-gypsum), about 10 wt.% to about 60 wt.% Portland cement (Type III is preferred), and about 4 wt.% to about 20 wt.% silica fiime. The ratio of silica fume to Portland cement should be at least about 0.3/] when the binder is produced by dry-blending the gypsum, Portland ceme and silica fume.  If the silica fume is dispersed in water, followed by mixing with dry-blended gypsum and Portland cement, the ratio of silica fume to Portland cement should be at least about 0.2/1.0.    Aggregate and/or fiber may be added to the master blend binder to form a construction material.<br>
Preferred binders according to the invention may be categorized by application.  For interior applications, such as fiberboard, for use in relatively dry areas, Binder I set forth in Table I, is preferred.<br>
For interior applications, such as shower backer boards, for use in relatively wet areas. Binder II set forth in Table II, is preferred.<br><br><br>
For exterior applications, such as siding and roofing, Binder<br>
III set forth in Table III, is preferred.<br>

The beta-gypsum component of the inventive master blend<br>
binder is calcium sulfate beta hemihydrate, commonly referred to as stucco.<br>
Beta-gypsum is traditionally less expensive than alpha-gypsum.   Alpha-<br>
hemihydrate powder has a higher apparent density and smaller related<br>
surface area than beta-hemihydrate, resulting in a lower water requirement<br><br>
for the same workability and a higher compressive strength of the set material.  However, boards made from the inventive composition have exhibited more than adequate strength for interior applications such as backer boards and floor underlayments and exterior applications, such as exterior sheeting and eaves.<br>
The Portland cement component of the master blend binde according to the invention may be any of Types I, II, III, IV, or V (or ^ mixtures thereof) as set forth according to ASTM standards.   However, Type III Portland cement is preferred.   Type III Portland cement develof an earlier high strength than Type I and Type II Portland cement.<br>
Blended cements also may be used in master blend binders according to the invention.  Blended cements are blends of Portland cemi with one or more pozzolanic materials such as fly ash and blast-furnace slag.   The pozzolanic materials that are added to produce a "blend" with Portland cement are distinguished from the pozzolanic aggregate compon which may be used with binders according to the invention in that the components of the cement "blend" have a particle size which is in the sa range as the particle size range of Portland cement.   Portland cement particle size may be defined as having approximately 15% of the particle retained on a 325 mesh screen.   In other words, at least 85% of the Portland cement particles pass through a 325 mesh screen (allows particli having a diameter of up to 45 microns to pass through).<br>
The silica fume component of the binder according to the invention is an extremely active pozzolan and prevents the formation of ettringite.   The silica fume for use in the invention is very fine (particle average diameter of between about 0.1 microns and about 0.3 microns), has a high surface area (between about 20 meters/gram and about 30 meters/gram as measured by BET (Baumer Emit &amp; Tellers)), and is highly amorphous (between about 92 wt. % and about 97 wt. % amorphous SiOj (glassy material)).<br><br>
The silica fume component according to the invention includes at most about 0.6 wt.% alumina in the form of aluminum oxide (AI2O3).  Preferably, the silica fume component according to the invention is made from the Silicon Metal Process.  Certain silica fume producing processes, such as that from the ferrosilicon alloy industry, are not acceptable for use in the invention as such silica fume includes more than about 0.6 wt. % alumina.  An example of a silica fiime acceptable for use in the invention is set forth in Table IV below.<br>
Table IV also includes a description of a rice-husk ash, which is an acceptable substitute for the silica fume component of the invention.   Because rice-husk ash is currently more expensive to procure than silica fume, it is not as desirable for commercial applications.<br><br>
In contrast to the silica fiime and rice-husk ash components, acceptable for use in the present invention, page 19 of Malhotra, M. and Mehta, P. Kumar, Pozzolanic and Cementitious Materials. Advances in Concrete Technology. Vol. 1, discloses typical oxide analyses of silicon<br><br>
fumes made from the ferrosilicon alloy industry having SiO2 amounts of as low as 83% and AI2O3 amounts from between 1.00% and 2.5%.  Page 18 discloses oxide analyses of certain North American blast-fiimace slags which have Si02 amounts of as low as 33% and AI2O3 amounts as high as 10.8%.  Thus, not all pozzolans, and specifically, not all silica fumes, are acceptable for use according to the invention.<br>
Binders according to the invention may be prepared by either a "dry" or a "wet" process.   In a "dry" process, the three, dry, binder components (calcium sulfate hemihydrate, Portland cement, and silica fiime) are fed to a mixer, such as a large batch or continuous mixer, and blended.   The dry-blend is then mixed with water, and other components, as desired, to form a construction product.   In a "wet" process, the calcium sulfate hemihydrate and the Portland cement are dry-blended, but the silica fume is first mixed with water (i.e., dispersed in the water).   The water containing dispersed silica fume is then mixed with the dry-blended calcium sulfate hemihydrate/Portland cement mixture.<br>
Binders according to the invention made by either the "dry" or "wet" process may then be mixed with aggregate or other fillers to produce compositions according to the invention for use in a variety of applications.   For example, binders according to the invention may be mixed with pozzolanic aggregate and/or cellulosic fiber, to produce compositions according to the invention.<br>
Compositions according to the invention may include about 10 wt. % to 1(X) wt. % of the master blend binder mixed with about 90 wt. % to about 0 wt. % of an aggregate (preferably pozzolanic aggregate) or fiber (preferably about 15 wt% to about 30 wt. % cellulosic fiber), to form a construction material.<br>
Compositions made with binders according to the invention produce construction materials which set up quickly, exhibit high strength and durability, and are water resistant.   Products produced from<br><br>
compositions according to the invention may be produced on a continuous line.  Because compositions according to the invention set up quickly (typically in three minutes or less), building materials made from such compositions can be handled (e.g. sheets can be cut into smaller sheets or boards) much faster than products made from Portland cement alone. Unlike traditional gypsum board, boards or other products made from compositions according to the invention do not require kiln drying, and in fact, kiln drying should be avoided.<br>
A pozzolanic aggregate which may be mixed with a master blend binder of the invention to create a composition according to the invention may include natural or man-made aggregate that contains a substantial percentage of amorphous silica.   Natural pozzolanic aggregates are of volcanic origin and include trass, diatomaceous earth, pumice, and perlite.   Man-made pozzolanic aggregates include fly ash and FILLITE (hollow silicate spheres which may be made from fly ash; produced by Finite Division of Boliden Intertrade, Inc. Atlanta, Georgia).   As compared to Portland cement "blend" components of the invention, pozzolanic aggregates used with master blend binders to provide compositions according to the invention are defined herein as having an average particle size larger than that of Portland cement (i.e., average particle diameter larger than 45 microns).<br>
Pozzolanic aggregates contain a substantial amount of amorphous silica which possesses little or no cementitious properties. However, in the presence of moismre, pozzolanic aggregates have surfaces that are chemically reactive with calcium hydroxide at standard temperatures to form hydrated calcium silicate (CSH) which, in compositions and methods according to the invention, are believed to become a homogeneous part of a cementitious system due also to the presence of the finely divided silica fume component of the invention. Compositions according to the invention which include both a pozzolanic<br><br>
aggregate and silica fiime (or rice-husk ash), result in cementitious materials wherein the transition zone between the aggregate and a cement paste is densified and thus produces a cured product of higher compressive strength than compositions which utilize a pozzolanic aggregate alone or silica fume with an inert aggregate.  It is believed that the mechanism which causes changes in the microstructure of compositions according to the invention to result in higher compressive strengths is associated with two effects: a pozzolanic effect and a micro-filler effect (due to the fine size and spherical shape of the silica fume).<br>
Cellulosic fibers may be mixed with a master blend binder of the invention to form a composition according to the invention.   Preferred fibers are wood and paper fibers, including recycled waste paper fibers and saw dust, other ligneous materials such as flax and cotton, and mixtures of such fibers.  Wood fiber is a particularly preferred cellulosic fiber component for a composition according to the invention.<br>
Most preferably, the fiber is obtained from debarked wood<br>
which is refined to long thin flakes having a thickness of about 0.008<br>
inches (about 0.2 mm) to about 0.013 inches (about 0.33 mm) and a length<br>
of up to about 1.18 inches (about 30 mm).  The flaked wood is then milled<br>
and screened and possibly further refined using known processes in order<br>
to provide fibers or fiber flakes of substantially constant geometry.	i<br>
If the wood fiber material used in a composition according to ", the invention is waste paper, such paper must first be processed to remove foreign material such as plastic, dirt and metals.  The paper is then further processed by shredding, preferably with a hammermill/screen assembly. The shredded paper is then preferably dry-refined to result in fibers of substantially constant geometry.<br>
As stated above, compositions according to the invention for use in interior applications preferably are made using the Binder I set forth in Table I.  Such a binder may be mixed with cellulosic fiber to produce a<br><br>
fiberboard according to the inveniion.   rreieraoiy, inicnor iiDerooarus according to the invention include (i) about 70 wt. % to about 90 wt. % of the Binder I disclosed in Table I; and (ii) about 30 wt. % to about 10 wt. % of a fiber component.   Depending on the application, it may be desirable to utilize the Binder II disclosed in Table II for a fiberboard interior application, or even the Binder III disclosed in Table III if the fiberboard is to be used in an exterior application subjected to the elements.   For example, a preferred composition for making outdoor siding includes (i) about 70 wt. % to about 75 wt. % of the Binder III disclosed in Table III; and (ii) about 30 wt. % to about 25 wt. % of a wood fiber component. Another preferred composition for making outdoor siding includes (i) about 82 wt. % to about 85 wt. % of the Binder III disclosed in Table III; and (ii) about 18 wt.% to about 15 wt.% cellulosic fiber component.<br>
The fiber component is preferably selected from wood fibers, plant fibers, and paper fibers.   It also may be glass fibers, polyethylene fibers, polypropylene fibers, nylon fibers, and other plastic fibers.<br>
A fiberboard according to the invention may be manufacmred by the following process:<br>
Raw gypsum may be calcined at about 160°C (320°F) to about 175°C (347°F) to form calcium sulfate hemihydrate.   The calcined gypsum can be post-ground to a finer particle size if, for example, certain strengths, water requirements, and working properties are desired.<br>
All components of the composition, including gypsum, cement, silica fume, water, fiber, and any other additives preferably are added to the batch on a weight basis.   Moisture in the wood fiber is measured and compensated for in the make-up water when mixed.<br>
The gypsum powder is fed to a mixer, such as a large batch or continuous mixer, and blended with Portland cement and silica fume. Alternatively, only the gypsum powder and the Portland cement are dry mixed and the silica fume is dispersed in water.<br><br>
In a second mixer, the fiber is mixed with water (or the silica fume/water mixture) to allow the fiber/water mixture to loosen.  The blended dry components of the binder are then added to the fiber/water mixture (or the fiber/water/silica fume) and intensively mixed.  Although water may be added to the binder/fiber mixture (or to the binder prior to mixing with the fiber), preferably, the water is added to the fiber and then the dry binder components are added to the water/fiber mixture.<br>
Most preferably, the water addition to the fiber and the subsequent binder addition to the wetted fiber are performed with the aid o computer control so that it is possible to add to the fiber the total quantity of water required for the process (i.e. a slight stoichiometric excess amoun of water required for hydration), and then vigorously mix the wetted fiber with the binder.<br>
Other ingredients, such as set control additives (e.g. accelerators), water reducing agents, water repellent additives, retarders, and latex or polymer modifiers may be added to the fiber/binder mixture. Some additives may be added to the dry binder mixture prior to mixing with the wet fiber.   Preferably, the composition includes about .01 wt.% tc about 1.5 wt.% retarder, based upon the total weight of the composition.<br>
The mixed composition is then conveyed directly to a forming machine which spreads an endless mat onto an elongated belt of a continuous press.  The mat enters the press on the conveyor belt, is pressed and may be cut into sections, and exits on a conveyor belt in the form of an endless board-ribbon or panel sections.  A pressing machine which can be used for this purpose is the BISON-HYDRO-DYN-PRESS (Bison GmbH, Springe, Germany).  In such a press, the hydration of the board occurs quickly and may be hastened by warming the board in the press up to an optimal hydration temperature.  Preferred processing conditions include pressing at room temperature (about 25°C) at pressures up to about thirty (30) kg/cm^ for a press/clamping time of about three (3) to about<br><br>
eight (8) hours.  Clamping time is minimized utilizing compositions according to the invention as compared to cement fiberboard which requires up to about sixteen hours of press/clamping time.<br>
The board-ribbon (or panel sections) leaving the press has sufficient green strength so that it can be transferred onto a conveyor which will carry the board forward to a cutting station.  Hydration may continue as the board-ribbon or panel sections are conveyed to the board cutter. The board-ribbon is then cut or sawed to a desired panel length.  If necessary, the panels are then dried to a final moisture content.<br>
Finally the board panels are trimmed and, if desired, split lengthwise to a final dimension.   Boards are typically cut into 3 ft. (0.9 meter) x 5 ft. (1.5 meter) sheets, and have a thickness between about 1/2 inch (about 1.3 cm) and about 5/8 inch (about 1.6 cm).<br>
«<br>
Compositions for construction materials such as backer boards and floor underlays according to the invention preferably are made from the Binder II disclosed in Table II.   Such compositions may include about 10 wt. % to about 50 wt. % of a pozzolanic aggregate (about 25 wt. % to about 35 wt.% is preferred).   A preferred aggregate for use in such construction materials is pumice.  Pumice is desirable as it is relatively light weight and can be sized to result in a product of desirable strength and physical properties.   For example, Hess Pumice Products Inc. manufactures a size No. 10 pumice aggregate that measures about 93% greater than 1400 microns, while the size No. 5 pumice aggregate has a particle size measurement of about 23% greater than 1400 microns.<br>
Although aggregates such as calcium carbonate, crystalline silica and different types of clay could be included in the composition, it has been found that the use of a pozzolanic aggregate results in a product according to the invention having superior properties.  As explained above, this is believed to occur because the surfaces of the pozzolanic aggregate filler react with free lime to form hydrated calcium silicate (pozzolanic<br><br>
reaction) which becomes part of the product matrix.  Such a reaction is only possible with pozzolanic aggregates.<br>
With reference to Figure 1, a backer board 1 according to the invention comprises a core 3 made from a cementitious composition according to the invention and adjacent cover sheets 5 and 7 disposed at either side thereof.  Such a board may be manufactured by the following process:<br>
Raw gypsum may be calcined at about 160°C (320°F) to about 175°C (347°F) to form calcium sulfate hemihydrate.  The calcined gypsum can be post-ground to a finer particle size if, for example, certain strengths, water requirements, and working properties are desired.   In a "dry" blend process according to the invention, the gypsum powder is fed to a mixer and blended with Portland cement, silica fiime and optionally, a pozzolanic aggregate.   The pozzolanic aggregate may be pumice, perlite, trass, or fly ash or a mixture thereof.    Cellulosic fiber may be added to the binder/aggregate mixmre.   Other ingredients that may be included in the composition are set control additives (e.g. accelerators), water reducing agents, water repellent additives and latex or polymer modifiers.  The resulting dry blend is combined with a slight stoichiometric excess of water to produce a slurry.<br>
In a "wet" process according to the invention, the silica fume component is first dispersed in water.  The gypsum and Portland cement are dry blended, followed by mixing with the silica fume/water mixture to produce a slurry.  In comparison to the "dry process" where the ratio of silica fume to Portland cement should be at least about 0.30/1.0, utilizing a "wet" pre-dispersed silica fume, the silica fume to Portland cement ratio may be lowered to a minimum of about 0.20/1.0.<br>
The binder/aggregate (and/or fiber) slurry, which forms the core 3 of the board, may be poured onto a lower, continuous cover sheet 5 which is disposed on a conveyor.   Then, an upper continuous cover sheet 7<br><br>
is placed on the core as it moves on the conveyor.  The cover sheets 5 and 7 are preferably made from fiberglass matt, fiberglass scrim, or a composite of both.  The cover sheets may also be non-woven or woven materials, such as polyethylene, polypropylene or nylon.  As the slurry sets, scrim and mat are imbedded into the slurry matrix during the forming process.  As the covered board moves along the conveyor line in a continuous sheet, the board gains sufficient strength so that it can be handled.  The board is then cut into sections, (for backer boards, usually either 3 ft. x 5 ft. or 3 ft. x 4 ft. sheets) and transferred to pallets.  The board thickness preferably ranges between about 1/8 inch and about 5/8 inch.   The boards are then preferably stacked and cured from one to seven days (particularly preferred about three days) at a temperature of about 16°C (60T) to about 27°C (80T) (i.e. room temperature) and a humidity of about 40% to about 70%, after which the boards may be sent to a customer.   The stacking of the boards advantageously provides a moist environment for curing.   The boards may be cured at temperatures and humidities outside of the above-stated ranges resulting in an acceptable product.   However, this may extend the curing time.   A board according to the invention usually substantially reaches a majority of its strength about fourteen to about twenty-eight days after formation.<br>
When preparing a board or other product according to the invention, the forced drying required for gypsum board should be avoided. An alternative curing procedure is to cover or wrap the boards in plastic wrapping for about three to seven days, depending upon the formulation of the composition, to retain moisture for continuous curing.  Such covered boards have exhibited about 50% higher strength than normal gypsum boards of the same density.   Also, the covered boards develop about 70%<br><br>
When a board or other product, such as a floor underlayment, having a thickness of about 1/8 inch is desired, the cementitious composition thereof is preferably made from Binder I which i then mixed with up to about 50 wt. % pozzolanic aggregate filler, resulting in a very strong thin product, especially useful, for example, for floor underlayments.<br>
Compositions according to the invention may also be used to prepare self-leveling floor compositions and road patching materials.   Such materials are preferably made from the Binder III disclosed in Table III. The binder is then mixed with aggregate, such as a local quartz sand, to form the floor or road patching material.<br>
Preferably, a self-leveling floor composition according to the invention includes (i) about 15 wt. % to about 75 wt.% the Binder III disclosed in Table III; and (ii) about 85 wt.% to about 25 wt.% aggregate in the form of sand.   The aggregate component may further include up to about 2 wt. % FILLITE pozzolanic aggregate.  Because of its low density, FILLITE addition of amounts as low as about 1 wt. % of the composition provide a considerable volume of aggregate (see Example 2, Table II for FILLITE physical properties).<br>
A preferred road patching composition according to the invention includes (i) about 25 wt. % to about 100 wt. % of the Binder III disclosed in Table III; and (ii) about 75 wt.% to about 0 wt.% sand.<br>
Fire-proofing sprays and fire-stopping materials may also be prepared using master blend binders according to the invention. Such fire-proofing and fire-stopping materials preferably include about 54 wt. % to about 99 wt. % of the Binder I disclosed in Table I, about 0 wt. % to about 27 wt.% pozzolanic aggregate, about 1 wt.% to about 16 wt.% vermiculite oar, about 0 wt. % to about 2 wt. % glass fiber, and about 0 wt. % to about<br><br>
acrylic resins and mixtures thereot (e.g., a cellulosic thickener, such as METHACEL (produced by Dow Chemical USA, Midland, MI).  If a pozzolanic aggregate is used, it is preferably FILLITE or perlite or mixmres thereof.<br>
EXAMPLE 1 A master blend binder according to the invention having a silica fume/Portland cement ratio of about 0.3/1.0 was prepared with the components set forth in the amounts stated in Table V below:<br>

In order to form a floor composition of a smooth consistency, composition #1 was mixed with about 26 wt. % water and composition #2 was mixed with about 24 wt. % water.  The density of composition #1 was 107 Ibs./ft3.  The density of composition #2 was 111.62 lbs./ftBoth compositions were allowed to dry at about 2rC (70°F) and a relative humidity of about 50%.  The compressive strengths of samples (2 inch by 2 inch by 2 inch cubes) of each of the compositions were tested after 2 hours of drying, and after 1, 3, 7 and 28 days by pressing in an Instron press according to ASTM C472-9A.<br><br>
The results of the compressive strength tests are shown in Fig. 2.  Composition #1 according to the invention exhibited a greater compressive strength than Composition #2 for all samples tested.  Although the compressive strengths of both compositions were similar after curing for 28 days, the advantage of a composition according to the invention is evident when the densities of the two compositions are taken into consideration.   Typically, a composition having a higher density should also exhibit a higher compressive strength.  However, in this instance, Composition #1 according to the invention had a lower density than Composition #2, and yet exhibited a slightly higher compressive strength.<br>

The materials identified in Table VII were dry mixed to form the master blend binder.   Then, about 75 wt. % of the binder was mixed with about 25 wt.% pumice aggregate (Hess Products, Inc., Malard City, Idaho) and 100 grams thereof was mixed with 43 grams of water.  To<br><br>
improve the workability of the mixture, a water reducing agent (lignosulfonates and/or naphthalene sulfonates manufactured by Georgia Pacific Corp. and Henkel Corp., respectively) was added.   The mixture was then formed into two-inch by two-inch by two-inch (2" x 2" x 2") cubes to evaluate strength gain over the time lapse of twenty-eight days. The cubes were sealed in a plastic bag and kept at room temperature (about 25°C).<br>
For the purpose of comparison, about 75 wt. % of the master blend binder of Table VII was mixed with about 25 wt. % of calcium carbonate (CaCOj), a non-pozzolanic aggregate having about the same particle size as the pumice, and 100 grams thereof was mixed with 44 grams of water.    This mixture also was formed into two-inch by two-inch by two-inch (2" x 2" x 2") cubes to evaluate strength gain over the time lapse of twenty-eight days.   The cubes were sealed in a plastic bag and kept at room temperature (about 25 °C).<br>
The density and wet compressive strengths for the samples made according to the invention and the comparative samples made with CaCOs were measured and are shown in Table VIII below:<br><br><br>
Table VIII illustrates the acceptable weight strength development of the samples made from a composition according to the invention.<br>
A second test was performed on the composition made from 75 wt.% master blend binder of Table VII and the pumice aggregate to smdy durability.   A four and one-half inch (4 1/2") diameter, one-half inch (1/2") thick patty of the composition was placed under running water for a period of two months.   No deterioration of the patty was visible and the total weight loss of the patty after the two-month test was 0.5%.<br>
In other tests, the master blend binder disclosed in Table VII was blended with up to about 50 wt. % pozzolanic aggregate filler (pumice or perlite), with and without foaming agent, to produce boards according to the invention.   Such boards exhibited acceptable physical properties as tested to pertinent ASTM standards.<br><br>

About 75% by weight of the dry-blended binder identified in Table IX was mixed with about 25 wt. % (dry weight) of wood fiber that had been mixed with water (slight stoichiometric excess).  The wetted fiber and binder were vigorously mixed, formed into mats and pressed into sample boards using a laboratory press (manufactured by Bison GmbH, Springe, Germany).   The pressing conditions included 30 kg/cm^ pressure; press temperamre of about 25°C; and a press time of three hours.<br>
The samples exhibited excellent dry and wet durability even when subjected to a continuous water spray.   The final products had an extremely smooth surface.<br>
Certain physical properties of boards made according to Example 3 were tested, including percent linear variation (ASTM D 1037), percent water absorption (ASTM D 1037), Mor"s 3-Point Loading (ASTM C 947; and nail pull (ASTM C 473).  For each of these tests, gypsum/cement/silica fume (GCSF) boards made according to Example 3 were compared to cement fiber boards made of about 82 wt. % Portland cement and about 18 wt.% cellulosic fiber.  The press time required for the cement fiber boards ranged between seven to ten hours.<br>
The results of the tests are set forth in the following tables:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
As shown in the tables above, boards made according to the invention exhibited comparable or improved physical properties as<br>

It is noted that the silica fume/Portland cement ratio of the products produced in Examples 4 and 5 was at least about .50/1.0. Although this ratio produces an acceptable product, it is not as cost effective as products made from a "dry" blend process having a silica fume/Portland cement ratio of 0.30/1.0.<br>

The gypsum and Portland cement components of each of the binders identified in Table XVIII were dry mixed.  Both of the binders were prepared by pre-dispersing silica fume in water, followed by mixing the silica fume/water mixture with the dry-blended gypsum/Portland cement mixture.  For each 600 grams of binder, 360 cc of water was used.   The cementitious mixmres were formed into two-inch by two-inch by two-inch<br><br>
(2" X 2" X 2") cubes which were sealed in a plastic bag and cured at room temperature (about 25°C) for about twenty-eight days.  The cubes were subjected to compressive strength tests and then each cube was immersed in a separate container of water, as a continuous ongoing test.<br>
The fissures (cracks) that occurred in the cubes during the compressive strength test, exposed cross sections of the cube cores to "sulfate reactivity," and thus to the possibility of the formation of ettringite.  Ettringite formation was monitored by checking the pH of the water twice a month, followed by changing (replacing) the water with fresh tap water.  Samples whose water measured a pH above 8.5 indicated ettringite formation.   Samples measuring a pH of less than 7.5 indicated that aggressive ettringite formation was not occurring.  The water-immersed cube samples made from the Binder "A" maintained a pH of about 7.0 over six months.  Water-immersed cubes made from the comparative Binder "B" were consistently at or above pH 8.5, indicating that aggressive ettringite formation was occurring.<br>
The formation of ettringite also became apparent visually in the cubes made from the comparative binder.   Fig. 6 shows a cube made from the Binder "A,"  after six months of water immersion.   Fig. 7, shows a cube made with the comparative Binder "B," also after six months of water immersion.<br>
To fiirther verify the formation of ettringite XRD (X-Ray Diffraction) tests were run on both cubes.  The chart shown in Fig. 8 is for the cube shown in Fig. 6 made from the inventive Binder "A" and the chart shown in Fig. 9 for the cube shown in Fig. 7 made from the comparative Binder "B."   The charts illustrate Intensity (counts per second) vs. 2-Theta Angle (degrees).   These charts show ettringite formation in both of the cubes.  However, the chart (Fig.9) for the comparative cube shown in Fig. 7 indicates higher, increasing, amounts of aggressive ettringite formation.<br><br><br>

Rather than dry-blending the gypsum, Portland cement, and ilica fume components, the silica fume was pre-dispersed in water and the ilica fume/water mixture was then mixed with a dry blend of gypsum and •ortland cement.  For each 600 grams of binder, 360 cc of water was sed.   The mixture was then formed into two-inch by two-inch by two-inch 2" X 2" X 2") cubes which were sealed in a plastic bag and cured at room jmperature (about 25°C).   The cubes were subjected to compressive trength tests twenty-eight days after their formation.   The cubes exhibited xcellent wet compressive strength of between 4429 and 4455 ounds/square inch.<br>
