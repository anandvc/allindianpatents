				<td>Holder for parts to be painted<br>
The invention relates to the field of tools for<br>
supporting components to be surface-treated, and more<br>
particularly components to be painted, for a vehicle<br>
equipped with a chassis.<br>
In this field, patent US 5 879 021 has proposed a<br>
carriage of adjustable size for transporting a<br>
plurality of components to be painted by a painting<br>
facility. Such a carriage juxtaposes, side by side, the<br>
components to be painted and allows them to move<br>
translationally over the entire length of the painting<br>
facility. The treatment cost with such a tool is in<br>
particular proportional to the length of the carriage<br>
divided by the speed of. translation through the<br>
painting installation. A reduction in the treatment<br>
cost is achieved in that document by the density of<br>
juxtaposition of the components.; However, the cost<br>
remains proportional to the size of the components to<br>
be treated.<br>
Patent application EP-A-013 966 discloses a device for<br>
holding vehicle components, making it easier to carry<br>
out a painting operation. That document proposes a<br>
positionally adjustable holder that can be adapted to<br>
various types of components.<br>
Moreover, patents US 5 . 127 359, US 6 109,	600 and<br>
US 6 173 947 disclose holders for large	vehicle<br>
components that are individually treated,	such as<br>
fenders.<br>
The above documents all describe tools for painting<br>
vehicle components that have the drawback of imposing a<br>
specific painting operation on the components in<br>
question. This may result in color variations or<br>
variations in the thickness of the treatment compared<br><br>
to the treatment of other types of components,<br>
especially compared to the treatment of the vehicle<br>
chassis.<br>
Finally, patent US 4 872 963 describes a holder for suspended components. The holder is conducting and is<br>
used for attaching a plurality of components intended<br>
to be dipped into a protective electrolytic bath. The<br>
holder described is connected to an electrode so that<br>
each component is in electrical contact with the<br>
holder. However, nothing in that document allows the<br>
treatment of suspended components to be harmonized with<br>
the treatment of other types of component.<br>
In addition, such a tool is suitable for components of<br>
very small dimensions, but is not suitable for components of intermediate size. This is because a<br>
specific problem arises in the case of the treatment of<br>
components having an overall size smaller than an<br>
external door, but nevertheless larger than nuts and<br>
bolts or handles. This type of component of<br>
intermediate size comprises, for example, glove box<br>
doors, or floor hatches. These components are often<br>
visible and exposed to the ambient environment so that<br>
it is generally necessary for the treatment of these<br>
components to have the same characteristics, both<br>
esthetic and technical, as the treatment of the chassis<br>
or body of the vehicle. The corrosion resistance of<br>
these components must in particular' be harmonized with<br>
that of the chassis. Such corrosion resistance is often<br>
achieved by a cataphoretic treatment.<br>
The invention proposes a tool for holding components<br>
that have to be surface-treated that solves these<br>
drawbacks and provides a treatment whose<br>
characteristics are identical to that of other types of<br>
component, especially identical to the treatment of the<br>
vehicle chassis.<br><br>
The object of the invention is also to very greatly<br>
reduce the cost of treating vehicle components,<br>
particularly components of intermediate size.<br>
The invention proposes a tool that is particularly well<br>
suited for a treatment using, a liquid bath, for example<br>
a painting treatment or an electrolytic treatment, and<br>
in particular a cataphoretic painting treatment.<br>
In one embodiment, the subject of the invention is a<br>
holder for components that have to be surface-treated,<br>
for a vehicle equipped with a chassis, which holder<br>
comprises means for fastening the components so that<br>
they move translationally with the holder, at least one<br>
means for electrically connecting at least one<br>
component to the holder, a means for electrically<br>
connecting the holder to an electrode, the two<br>
electrical connection means being electrically<br>
connected together. The holder includes at least one<br>
means for mechanically fastening the holder to the<br>
vehicle chassis.<br>
It should be understood that such a holder, since it is<br>
fastened to the chassis of the vehicle, allows the<br>
components that it supports to undergo a surface<br>
treatment identical to that undergone by the vehicle<br>
chassis. It should also be understood that such a<br>
holder very greatly reduces the treatment costs that<br>
are partly masked by the vehicle chassis treatment<br>
costs.<br>
Advantageously, the holder includes means for<br>
mechanically fastening each component to the holder,<br>
which, for example, offer a contact area, for contact<br>
between each component and the holder, of less than 10%<br>
and preferably less than 1% of the area of said<br>
component distributed over at most ten and preferably<br><br>
at most four separate regions. The mechanical fastening<br>
means may also include means for electrically<br>
connecting the component to the holder.<br>
It should be understood that such a holder, which<br>
electrically connects and mechanically fastens the<br>
components to be painted, is particularly suitable for<br>
cataphoretic painting treatments in which the liquid of<br>
the cataphoresis bath is in perpetual movement.<br>
When the chassis includes a part forming the cabin of<br>
the vehicle, the holder, equipped with the components<br>
to be treated, advantageously has an overall external<br>
volume that can be introduced into the inside of said<br>
cabin.<br>
Advantageously, the area of the contact between the<br>
holder and the vehicle chassis is located on the<br>
transmission tunnel in the cabin of the vehicle. This<br>
is because the transmission tunnel of a vehicle<br>
generally lies in the length direction of the vehicle<br>
and passes, in the cabin, between the seat positions.<br>
When the chassis is in the painting phase, the seats<br>
are not installed so that the transmission tunnel<br>
forming an integral part of the chassis is in a raised<br>
position inside the cabin of the vehicle. It should be<br>
understood that, since the holder for the components to<br>
be painted is fixed onto this transmission tunnel, it<br>
will also be in a raised position inside the cabin, so<br>
that the presence of the holder equipped with these<br>
components to be painted does not impede the work of<br>
the. operators inside the cabin. This position is<br>
particularly well suited for cataphoretic painting<br>
treatments for treating both the outside surfaces and<br>
the inside surfaces in the same way.<br>
Advantageously, the holder of the invention has a<br>
contact area, for contact with the cabin, that is<br><br>
divided into at least two contact regions that are<br>
spaced apart by at least 10% and preferably by at least<br>
50% of the large dimension of the components to be<br>
painted. It should be understood that such a holder<br>
therefore benefits from a bed on the transmission<br>
tunnel that is sufficiently large to withstand the<br>
forces exerted by the liquid on the components to be<br>
painted. This feature is particularly important in the<br>
case of components with a generally flat appearance<br>
that are treated cataphoretically. This is because when<br>
such components enter the cataphoresis bath, there is a<br>
"spoon effect" which means that when the components are<br>
not completely immersed in the bath, they have a<br>
tendency to float on top of this bath. If the seating<br>
provided by the means for fastening the holder to the<br>
vehicle chassis is insufficient, the holder and the<br>
components that it contains . are detached when the<br>
components come into contact with the surface of the<br>
bath.<br>
Also advantageously, the entire holder is made of a<br>
material that withstands a temperature between 2 0°C and<br>
200°C. In addition, the means for fastening the<br>
components to the holder may be provided with parts of<br>
low thermal inertia that are intended to be handled.<br>
This allows the holder to be used for the baking phase<br>
that follows the cataphoretic treatment.<br>
Other features and advantages of the invention will<br>
become apparent on reading the detailed description of<br>
a few. embodiments given by- way of nonlimiting example<br>
and illustrated by the appended drawings in which:<br>
- figure 1 is a perspective view of one embodiment<br>
of a holder according to the invention;<br><br>
-	figure 2 is a section on II-II of figure 1,<br>
showing the components to be painted and the<br>
transmission tunnel; and<br>
-	figure 3 is a schematic representation of the<br>
chassis of the vehicle on which the holder is intended<br>
to be installed.<br>
As illustrated in figure 1, the holder, in this<br>
embodiment, comprises a longitudinal member 1, a front<br>
cross-member 2 and a rear cross-member 3 that are<br>
vertical and fastened to the longitudinal member 1. A<br>
horizontal front arm 4 and a horizontal rear arm 5<br>
extend transversely to the axis of the longitudinal<br>
member 1. A frame 6 extends vertically from the<br>
left-hand edge of the arms and comprises a front post 7<br>
and a rear post 8 rising up from the left-hand edges of<br>
the respective front and rear arms. A transverse bar 9<br>
joins the top edge 10a of the front post 7 to the top<br>
edge of the rear post 8. Transverse reinforcements 11a<br>
and l1b ensure that the posts are held rigidly on the<br>
respective front and rear arms.<br>
The longitudinal member 1 is equipped with a front<br>
fastening means 12 comprising a horizontal lateral<br>
plate 13 that is approximately rectangular and fastened<br>
to the longitudinal member 1. The fastening means 12<br>
also includes a handle 14, in the unlocked position in<br>
figure 1. The longitudinal member 1 also comprises a<br>
cylindrical cross-member 15 transverse to the axis of<br>
the longitudinal member 1 and fastened to the bottom<br>
surface la of the longitudinal member 1.<br>
A rear tab 16 projects from the main part of the<br>
longitudinal member 1 and has a horizontal part 16a<br>
downwardly offset and parallel to the longitudinal<br>
member 1, the upper surface of the horizontal portion<br><br>
16a being lower than the lower part 15a of the<br>
cylindrical cross-member 15.<br>
A front bracket 17 and a rear bracket 18 each comprise<br>
a respective vertical part 19, - 20 fastened to the<br>
left-hand end of the front arm and rear arm<br>
respectively, and also include a respective horizontal<br>
portion 21, 22, these portions being parallel to the<br>
longitudinal member. A front inclined bracket 23 and a<br>
rear inclined bracket 24 each include a respective fixed part 25, 26, these parts being fastened to the<br>
front and rear arms respectively both inclined toward<br>
the top of the front and rear posts, respectively. They<br>
also include a respective part 27, 28, which are<br>
perpendicular to the inclined parts and parallel to the<br>
axis of the longitudinal member 1. The inclined<br>
brackets 23 and 24 are each equipped with a respective<br>
lateral stop 31 and 32. The same applies to the<br>
brackets 21 and 22, each of the lateral stops rising<br>
perpendicular to the brackets and parallel to the parts<br>
fixed to the arms. Likewise, each of the brackets 17,<br>
18, 23, 24 is equipped with a respective contact stop<br>
33, 34, 35, 36. The contact stops 33, 35, 3 6 each have<br>
a respective bearing surface 37, 39, 40. The same<br>
applies to the contact stop 34.<br>
A front sole plate 41 and a rear sole plate 42 are<br>
fastened to the top of the front post and rear post<br>
respectively. The front sole plate 41 has a vertical<br>
part 43 extending downward and parallel to. the front<br>
post 7. It also has an inclined part 44 extending to<br>
the right of the post toward the fixed part 25 of the<br>
inclined bracket 23. Likewise, the rear sole plate 42<br>
has a vertical part 45 extending downward parallel to<br>
the post 8 and an inclined part 46 extending to the<br>
right toward the fixed part 26 of the inclined bracket<br>
24. The vertical part 43 and the inclined parts 44 and<br>
46 possess a respective contact stop 47, 49 and 50,<br><br>
each contact stop being, equipped with a bearing surface<br>
51, 53, 54 respectively. The same applies to the<br>
vertical part 42.<br>
Figure 2 shows the holder according to the invention<br>
equipped with a vertical component 55 to be treated and<br>
with an inclined component 56 to be treated. The holder<br>
is fastened to a vehicle transmission tunnel 57,<br>
indicated by the dotted lines in the figure. The front<br>
fastening means 12 includes a 'cross-member 59 and an<br>
oblong piece 60, both these being fastened so as to<br>
rotate as one with the handle 14 and able to rotate<br>
relative to the plate 13. An opening 61 made in the<br>
transmission tunnel allows the oblong piece 60 to be<br>
introduced into the transmission tunnel 57. When the<br>
handle 14 is pivoted through one quarter of a turn,, the<br>
oblong piece 60 slides beneath the lower wall 58 of the<br>
transmission tunnel.<br>
It should be noted that the plate 12 is not in direct<br>
contact with the upper surface 62 of the transmission<br>
tunnel. The same applies to the bottom surface la of<br>
the longitudinal member 1. This is because the rear tab<br>
16 is introduced into a slot 70 (visible in figure 3)<br>
of the transmission tunnel so that the horizontal<br>
portion 16a is in contact with the lower wall 58 of the<br>
transmission tunnel. The entire holder is therefore<br>
fastened by three contact regions to the transmission<br>
tunnel. The portion 16a of the rear tab 16 and the<br>
portion 60a of the oblong piece 60 are in contact with<br>
the lower surface 58 of the transmission tunnel while<br>
the lower part 15a of the cylindrical cross-member 15 is in contact with the upper part 62 of. the<br>
transmission tunnel 57. Thus, the upper part 62 of the<br>
transmission tunnel is almost entirely disengaged and<br>
capable of being treated cataphoretically without being<br>
impeded by the presence of the holder.<br><br>
The contact between the portion 16a of the rear tab and<br>
the surface 58 of the transmission tunnel and the.<br>
contact between the oblong piece 60 and the inner<br>
surface 58 of the transmission tunnel make it possible<br>
to ensure electrical contact between the entire holder<br>
and the chassis. In an electrolytic treatment or a<br>
cataphoretic treatment, the entire chassis is in turn<br>
connected to an electrode, such as an anode. Thus, all<br>
the components to be treated are connected via the<br>
transmission tunnel and via the contact stops to the<br>
electrode.<br>
Handles 63, 64, 65, 66 are screwed into the stops 47,<br>
33, 49 and 35 respectively, passing through the<br>
components 55 and 56 to be treated. The areas of<br>
contact 63a, 64a, 65a and 66a of the handles in contact<br>
with the components to be treated have been reduced to<br>
a minimum and correspond to areas that will, not be<br>
treated and will have to be touched up subsequently or<br>
masked, for example by a plastic cover. The contact<br>
areas 51, 37, 53 and 39 have also been reduced to a<br>
minimum for the same reason. They also fulfill the<br>
function of electrical contact between the holder and<br>
the components 55 and 56 to be treated. The handles 63,<br>
64, 65, 6 6 are made of a material having a low thermal<br>
inertia, such as plastic. This allows the operator to<br>
be able to easily dismantle the components as soon as<br>
the vehicle equipped with the holder and with the<br>
components to be treated leaves the baking step that is<br>
usually about 180°C. Similar handles.are used to fasten<br>
the components 55 and 56 to be painted onto the<br>
brackets 18 and 24, onto the right-hand part 45 and<br>
onto the inclined part 46. The positions of the points<br>
of contact and of the bearing surfaces depend on the<br>
shapes of the components to be painted, which may be<br>
flat or curved.<br><br>
As may be seen in figure 3, the holder equipped with<br>
the components to be treated, which is shown by the<br>
dotted lines, is housed inside the cabin 67 of the<br>
vehicle. The transmission tunnel 57 occupies a region<br>
located between the seats (which are not shown),<br>
passing through a portion of the chassis forming the<br>
cabin 67 of the vehicle. The chassis also includes a<br>
front floor 68a and 68b and a rear floor 69a and 69b.<br>
The rear floor is higher than the front floor. The<br>
cross-members 2 and 3 allow the arms 4 and 5 of the<br>
holder to be raised so that they can lie above the rear<br>
floor 69a or 69b.<br>
The entire holder is fastened to two slots made in the<br>
transmission tunnel 57, the slot 70 receiving the rear<br>
tab 16 and the slot 61 receiving the front fastening<br>
means 12. The slot 61 is for example a slot serving for<br>
passage of the gear lever. The slot 70 may also serve<br>
to expel the air so that the cataphoresis liquid<br>
penetrates more easily into the transmission tunnel.<br>
Other ways of fastening the holder onto the<br>
transmission tunnel are also suitable, such as clasps,<br>
magnets or other devices for fastening onto the tunnel<br>
with a small area. Two contact regions separated in the<br>
length direction of the chassis, a significant distance<br>
apart relative to the dimensions of the metal sheets to<br>
be treated, help to improve the seating of the holder<br>
on the chassis and to resist the "spoon effect" when<br>
the chassis of the vehicle penetrates the cataphoresis<br>
bath.<br>
In one particular embodiment, the longitudinal member 1<br>
uses a hollow beam of square cross section with sides<br>
of 40 mm, and likewise the cross-members 2 and 3 and<br>
the arms 4 and 5. The posts 7 and 8 and the transverse<br>
bar 9 use a hollow beam of square cross section with<br>
sides of 2 0 mm. The sole plates and the brackets are<br><br>
made from 4 mm thick metal sheet and the contact stops<br>
use an M6 nut. The cylindrical cross-member 19 has for<br>
example a diameter of 12 mm. Other embodiments of the<br>
invention are produced with a different architecture,<br>
adapted to the type of components to be treated.<br><br>
