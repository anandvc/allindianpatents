				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to an environmentally benign process for preparation of (+)2-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-methyl butanoic acid. More particularly, the present invention provides a method for optical resolution of (±)2-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-methyl butanoic acid (hereinafter referred to as CPA) which may be carried out in water and partly/totally miscible organic solvents preferably alcohols containing C1-C.s carbon chain. The method provides a simpler process besides the effective-recovery and recycle of undesired isomer (-) CPA, resolving agent, and the organic solvent employed thereby resulting quantitative yields. The method of invention makes it possible to use same solvent system for the process of refining the salt to obtain high optical purity of CPA in one refinement which makes the process simpler less cumbersome, more efficient, and thereby advantageous for industrial application Background of the invention<br>
CPA is an important component, of commercially important synthetic pyrithroids such as fenvalarate, flucythrinate, esfenvalerate etc. The bioefficacy of esters (A alpha isomer of fenvalarate) obtained by reaction of optically active (+) CPA acid is increased by two to four folds in comparison to that of esters of racemie caboxylic acids.<br>
Reference is made to UK Patent Application GB 2014137A, wherein the resolution of CPA using aqueous ethanol in large quantities is described. The drawback of this process is use of large quantity of aqueous ethanol, and 1:1 equivalent of resolving amine and longer reaction time which prohibits its industrial application. The recovery of ethanol from aqueous solution further complicates the process in separation of the valuable solvent and its recycle.<br>
JP Patent 55-136245 by Sumitomo Chemical Company Ltd. Japan claims a method for the optical resolution of (+) CPA with optical purity of +45.93° of (+) CPA acid with an yield of 41.7% based on (±) CPA charged. However, this claim could not be reproduced in practice under the same experimental conditions as described therein. What was achieved was optical rotation of + 40.5° against claimed value [(+)45.93"] and the claimed value could not be obtained even after five crystallizations and modifications in the experimental conditions (see Table 1 herein) This patent also employs three solvent system for resolution of (±) CPA and<br>
purification of salt is carried out in a different solvent system than used for resolution<br>
of acid. The inherent draw back of this cited reference is because of the use of<br>
different solvent systems for optical resolution causing the cross contamination of the<br>
solvents and the separation of which poses environmental and commercial problems<br>
and needs innovation to obviate these problems.<br>
JP Patent 62-185044 describes the asymmetric reduction of olefin derivatives<br>
in presence of noble metal catalyst modified with optically active binaphthyl<br>
derivative under pressure. The draw back of this method, is poor recycle of expensive<br>
catalyst and very high pressure, both of which are difficult to adopt for commercial<br>
production.<br>
Reference is made to EP 0 060 466A1 wherein the CPA is resolved using<br>
DBA. This method suffers from the disadvantage of repetitive crystallization to obtain<br>
(+) and (-) salts of CPA involving longer crystallization times (24 hrs) and also a<br>
different solvent system is employed for refinement of salt of CPA, which is<br>
disadvantageous for industrial application.<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for production<br>
of optically pure (+) CPA which obviates the drawbacks of the prior art detailed<br>
above.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a process for the production of<br>
optically pure (+) CPA which with less number of refmements(one/two) and using the<br>
same solvent system used for resolution of (±)CPA for refinements.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a process for the production of<br>
optically pure (+) CPA which enables the effective recovery and recycling of (-) CPA<br>
after racemization.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide a process for the production of<br>
optically pure (+) CPA wherein the recovery of the optically active resolving amine is<br>
done in an effective manner and its recycle is significant in conserving reagent and<br>
enhancing the cost effectiveness of the process.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide an environmentally friendly<br>
process for the production of optically active (+) CPA by enabling the recycling of the<br>
resolving agent, acid and the organic solvent used.<br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
The process of the invention involves recovery and recycling of the undesired<br>
R-isomer, recover and recycle of the expensive resolving agent and use of a solvent<br>
system wherein the loss of solvent to environment is minimized. In this quest for<br>
development of a suitable methodology, a comprehensive search for a better solvent<br>
system was undertaken to overcome the problems encountered in referred patent JP-<br>
55-136245. The results are tabulated in Table-2 (page Nos. 28 to 34). After<br>
evaluation of the data of Table-2 it was observed that optical resolution can be carried<br>
out in water and partly/totally miscible organic solvents preferably alcohols like<br>
butanol, propanol for the preparation of (+) CPA.<br>
The present method is carried out in water and partly/totally miscible organic<br>
»<br>
solvents and the latter being preferably, alcohols containing C3-C5 carbon units and to<br>
use the same solvent system for refining process of diastereomeric salt so as to obtain<br>
+CPA with high optical purity. Despite many methods known in literature, the<br>
chemical method of resolution through salt formation with organic base and its<br>
fractional crystallization or the diastereomeric salt formation with optically active<br>
amine, is preferred and the latter being more practicable for industrial application<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the optical resolution of (+)<br>
CPA is performed by its diastereomeric salt formation using a resolving agent. The<br>
result of resolution is determined by two equilibria as disclosed in the article "A<br>
convenient method for optical resolution via diastereomeric salt formation" by<br>
M.ACS et al in Tetrahedron Vol. 41, No. 12, pp 2465-2470". The theoretical<br>
possibility for a resolution via diastereomeric salt formation is due to differences in<br>
physico chemical properties of the diastereomeric salt pairs formed during the course<br>
of reaction of racemate (AB) and resolving agent (RH) with opposite chemical<br>
The virtual (chemical) yield is dependant on solubility of the salt in a given<br>
solvent system but optical yield is controlled by solubility differences. The solubility<br>
differences of salts is effected by a chiral and achiral factors. The resolutions<br>
mediated by diastereomeric salts depend principally on solubility differences and on<br>
the equilibration between salt and solution. It is important to note that sometimes the<br>
insoluble diastereomeric salt crystallizes out and Ijie more soluble distereomeric salt is<br>
likely to undergo exchange with the racemate thereby increasing the formation of<br>
more insoluble diastereomeric salt provided the resolving agent used is less than<br>
stoicheiometric amount. This phenomenon will yield preferentially diastereomeric<br>
salt of one of the enantiomers more than the other. During the course of resolution in<br>
a two solvent system the reactants are soluted in their convenient solvent. The<br>
resolving agent solution is added to that of racemate with stirring. In this two phase<br>
system, a rather complicated equilibrium takes place at the liquid-liquid interface as a<br>
result of which the crystallization/precipitation starts and continues at liquid-liquid<br>
interface which necessitates continuous mixing. The crystallization/precipitation is<br>
carried out by cooling at a predetermined temperature for a certain period of time.<br>
The optical resolution is carried out usingJJpmmercially available optically<br>
active amines such as different acyclic, heterocyclic, aromatic amines, basic amines<br>
like, brucine, cinchonine, morphine, stychine, basic aminoacids, glycine, agrinine,<br>
and the like, more preferably optically active amine is an aryl amine containing 8 to<br>
20 carbons especially, alpha-phenylethyl amine (herein after referred as PEA) or ct~<br>
phenyl-p(p-tolyl)ethylamine, a-phenyl-p-phenylethyl amine or N, N-dialkyl aphenylethylamine<br>
or N,N- dimethyl or di-propyl, di-isopropyl or N-methyl, N-ethyl or<br>
higher alkyl amines.<br>
The optical resolution of (±)CPA as for the solvent used in the reaction, the<br>
main criteria is the crystallization/precipitation of the desired diastereomeric salt from<br>
the solvent system employed usually water, hydroxylic or an aliphatic, aromatic or<br>
carboacyclic hydrocarbon solvents like alcohol having 1-5 carbon atoms such as<br>
methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, n-butanol, isobutanol, sec.butanol, tert-butanol,<br>
ethylene glycol, methoxy ethanol isopropylalcohol, or preferably alcohol containing<br>
3-4 carbon atoms such as n-propanol, isopropanol, or preferably alcohol containing,<br>
n-butanol, tert. Butanol, sec.butanol, more preferably butanol, propanol, water or<br>
mixtures thereof. In the present invention the said alcohols are mixed with water in<br>
different proportions form 0-100% more preferably in the range of 20-40%.<br>
The quantity of resolving agent used for the optical resolution of racemic CPA<br>
is variable and it is in the range of 0.5-1.0 mole against one mole of acid, more<br>
preferably in the range of 0.4-0.8. Resolving agent can be added in one lot or over a<br>
period of time ranging from 5 minutes to 120 minutes, more preferably 10-40 minutes<br>
at a temp, from 25° C to 100°C more preferably from 30°C to 70°C.<br>
The (±)CPA is reacted with optically active amine in the solvent as<br>
mentioned above in the presence of appropriate amount of water. The temp, of<br>
reaction is not limited, but it is desirable to keep temp, at 40°-150° during or after the<br>
reaction, in order to obtain (+) CPA of high optical purity while keeping the temp, at<br>
above mentioned range, the precipitated salt of (+) CPA and amine, is separated from<br>
mother liquor preferably by slow cooling. At this stage, the remaining CPA in mother<br>
liquor is in (-) form. The separating temp, is 25° to 70°C or more preferably 30°<br>
to 55°C. The separation of PEA salt is effected by filteration/centrifiigation while<br>
cooling the filtrate by external means/or at ambient temp. The (+)CPA-(-)PEA salt is<br>
washed with the same solvent system used for resolution to remove any adhering<br>
mother liquor and separated by filtration/centrifugation. The washings obtained is<br>
kept aside for use in washings of salt of subsequent batches or mixed as the case may'<br>
be. The (+)CPA-(-) PEA salt thus obtained is subjected to refinement either by using<br>
fresh solvent system as used in resolution step or by the filtrate obtained from<br>
previous batches of refinement provided the optical rotation is in the acceptable range.<br>
The slurry thus obtained is refluxed for a period ranging from 60 to 240 minutes more<br>
preferably 60-180 mts. and then cooled to 35°-70°C more preferably 45°-60°C over a<br>
period of 60-360 minutes more preferably 60-180 minutes followed by<br>
filtration/centrifugation at above mentioned temp. The (+)CPA - (-) PEA salt<br>
obtained if necessary is recharged into reactor and alcoholic aqueous Solvents more<br>
preferably butanol water in the concentration of 20-40% water, more preferably 30-<br>
35% is added and heated to reflux for about 20-120 minutes more preferably 30-40<br>
minutes, followed by filtration/centrifugation. The (+)CPA - (-) PEA salt is dried in<br>
vacuum oven at a temperature ranging from 50°-80°C preferably at 50-60°C. The<br>
filtrate is recycled for refinement of (+)CPA-(-) PEA salt of fresh batches as such<br>
without any further operations, as mentioned above. The dried (+)CPA-(-) PEA salt<br>
thus obtained is liberated with mineral or organic acids like hydrochloric acid, sulfuric<br>
acid, acetic acid in aqueous medium. The liberated (+)CPA is extracted into organic<br>
solvent like chloroform, Dichloromethane, Dichloroethane or mixtures thereof, or<br>
aromatic hydrocarbons like toluene, benzene and the organic layer is concentrated<br>
under vacuum at 50°-80°C to obtain (+)CPA. The acidified aqueous layer obtained<br>
after recovery of (+)CPA is kept aside to recover the resolving amine.<br>
The mother liquor contain the undesired optically active CPA moiety (- form)<br>
usually as amine salt and washings of (+)CPA - (-)PEA salt obtained from resolution^<br>
is treated to recover the undesired acid. Normally the mother liquor is subjected to<br>
distillation under reduced pressure of 20-100 mm of Hg, more preferably 25-30 mm<br>
of Hg. at a still temp, from 40°-100°C, more preferably 60°-80°C. The distillate<br>
obtained is recycled after estimation of moisture content. The bottoms, thus obtained<br>
is made free of organic solvent and acidified with mineral acids such as hydrochloric<br>
acid, sulfuric acid, organic acids like acetic acid or aqueous Alkali such as sodium or<br>
potassium hydroxide or calcium hydroxide for recovery of (-) CPA or resolving agent<br>
as the case may be.<br>
The (-)CPA-(-) PEA salt is acidified with mineral or organic acids like<br>
hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, acetic acid in aqueous medium. The liberated (-)CPA<br>
is extracted into organic solvent like chloroform, Dichloromethane, Dichloroethane<br>
or mixtures thereof, or aromatic hydrocarbons like toluene, benzene and the organic<br>
layer is concentrated under vacuum at 50°-80°C to obtain (-)CPA which is racemized<br>
for further use in resolution. The acidified aqueous layer containing (-) PEA is taken<br>
for recovery of optically active resolving agent by combining with acidified aqueous<br>
layer obtained from (+) CPA recovery.<br>
The two acidified aqueous layers obtained after recovery (+)CPA and (-) CPA<br>
are mixed as aqueous layer streams and cool??4 ~ 5-20°C, more preferably 5-10° and<br>
extracted with aqueous alkali solution of c, t aration ranging from 10-80% more<br>
preferably 30-60% resulting in separation of crude layer of optically active resolving<br>
agent which is separated out. Aqueous alkali solution is extracted with aromatic<br>
hydrocarbon solvents like benzene, toluene or chlorinated hydrocarbon solvents like<br>
chloroform, Dichloromethane, Dichloroethane and concentrated to recover optically<br>
active resolving agent. Optically active resolving agent thus obtained is recycled for<br>
further batches after ascertaining optical purity.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration and therefore should<br>
not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLE -1<br>
In a suitable reaction vessel, 42.2g of (±)-CPA and 138.0g of 30% aqueous npropanol<br>
was charged and heated to form a solution. A solution of 14.2g (-) PEA in<br>
42g of 30% aqueous n-propanol was added to the above solution at 52°C. The mixture<br>
was heated to the reflux temperature for (88°C) about 60 minutes and the contents<br>
were allowed to reach to 37°C under stirring in about 120 minutes. The precipitated<br>
(+) CPA-(-) PEA salt(cake) was filtered off and washed with 50g of 30% aqueous npropanol<br>
twice separating the filtrate each time. The wet cake was dried and weighed.<br>
The general procedure followed for liberation of the (+)CPA from its amine salt was<br>
described below. A small portion of the salt (2.0g) was extracted with 30ml of 40%<br>
Sulphuric acid. The liberated (+) CPA, was extracted with 2 x 20 ml of DCM and<br>
concentrated to obtain (+) CPA, which was dried and analysed for its optical purity by<br>
polorimetry. The same procedure was followed for all the examples described below.<br>
Dry weight = 23.16 g. aD = +41.09° [CHC13, C = 6.00]<br>
EXAMPLE-2<br>
To 42.26g of (±)-CPA was added under stirring 120g of 20% aqueous nbutanol<br>
to form a solution. A solution of 14.26g of (-) PEA in 40g of 20% aqueous nbutanol<br>
was added to above solution at 55°C. The reaction mixture was refluxed for<br>
about 90 minutes and allowed to cool slowly to 37°C in about 90-120 minutes. The<br>
precipitated CPA-(-)PEA salt (cake) was filtered off and washed with 50g of 20%<br>
aqueous butanol under stirring twice separating the filtrate each time. The wet cake<br>

CPA. The cake (6.38kg) obtained is charged into the reactor and recrystallized using<br>
19.18 kg of Butanol and 8.3kg of water by heating the reaction mixture to vigorous<br>
reflux under stirring (92-93°C), maintained at that temperature for 60- minutes and<br>
then allowed to cool to 55-60°C over a period of 120minutes. Recrystallized slurry is<br>
filtered under vacuum (120-lOOmm). The filtrate obtained (27.06kg) is kept in storage<br>
tank to be used for subsequent batches of recrystallization of cake. The cake obtained<br>

glass stirred reactor, followed by 2.96kg of distilled water and 9.1kg of toluene. 2.37<br>
kg of 40% aqueous Sulphuric acid is added to the contents of the reactor over a period<br>
of 30-40 minutes under stirring and mixed well for 15-20 minutes, after which the<br>
layers are allowed to separate. The acidified aqueous layer (SA-1; 6.41kg) containing<br>
PEA- HSO4 is stored for recovery of (-) PEA. The toluene layer is washed with<br>
distilled water (3 x 3.0kg) till pH. of aqueous layer is neutral. The aqueous layers are<br>
kept aside for reuse in subsequent batches. The toluene layer is concentrated under<br>
reduced pressured (40-30 mm) at 40-50°C to obtain 1.99 kg of (+) CPA of optical<br>
purity 42.8 (CHCb, C=6.05) which is subsequently converted to acid chloride to be<br>
used in preparation of Esfenvalerate.<br>
The mother liquor (ML-1, 28.319kg) and washing (WS-1; 10.02) obtained<br>
from above described resolution process of (±) CPA containing R enriched (-) CPA is<br>
fed into a Rotary evaporator equipped with vacuum system, and made free of butanol<br>
and water at a temperature of 60°-70°C under vacuum (21-6 mm) by addition of<br>
5.1kg of fresh distilled water during distillation. After ensuring the complete removal<br>
of solvent, 1.97 kg of 40% aqueous Sulphuric acid is fed into the reactor and mixed<br>
for 20-40 minutes, followed by addition of 5.08kg of toluene. The liberated (-)CPAPEA<br>
sulfate solution is transferred into a 20.0 lit. glass stirred reactor and stirred for<br>
20-30 minutes after which the layers were allowed to separate. The acidic aqueous<br>
layer containing (-)PEA -HSO4 (RA-1; 4.2kg) is stored to be mixed with<br>
corresponding acidic aq. layer obtained from (+)CPA acid recovery to liberate (-<br>
)PEA. Toluene layer is washed with distilled water (3 x 3.0kg) till pH of aqueous<br>
layer is neutral. These washings are stored for reuse in subsequent batches. Toluene<br>
layer (8.39kg) is concentrated in Rota evaporator, under vacuum (40-6mm) at<br>
temperature of 40-50°C to obtain 3.67kg (-) CPA which is dried in vacuum tray drier<br>
at 40-45°C to yield 3.3kg of (-) CPA which is subsequently racemised to (±) CPA.<br>
The acidified aqueous layers (SA-1, 6.4kg ; RA-1, 4.2kg) obtained from recovery of<br>
corresponding (+)CPA and (-) CPA are mixed and charged into 20.0 lit. glass stirred<br>
reactor and cooled to 10-5°C. 2.04kg of 50% caustic lye solution is added while<br>
stirring the contents in 60-75 minutes and the layers are allowed to separate out.<br>
Upper layer containing (-) PEA is separated out (2.14kg) and stored to be used for<br>
further batches of racemiation of (±)CPA. Aqueous layer is washed twice (2 x 2.0kg)<br>
with toluene. Toluene layer was estimated for PEA content and recycled for further<br>
batches.<br>
The main advantages of the present invention are:<br>
1. The present invention makes it possible to obtain high optically pure (+)CPA with<br>
less number of refinements(one/two) and utilizes same solvent system as used for<br>
resolution of (±)CPA for refinements.<br>
