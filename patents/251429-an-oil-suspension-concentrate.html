Description<br>
Concentrated oily suspension<br>
The present invention relates to the field of crop protection compositions. In particular, the invention relates to liquid formulations in the form of oil suspension concentrates comprising herbicidally active compounds from the group of the thienylsulfonamides.<br>
In general, active compounds for crop protection are not employed in pure form. Depending on the area of use and the type of use, and on physical, chemical and biological parameters, the active compound is used as an active compound formulation in a mixture with customary auxiliaries and additives. Also known are combinations with further active compounds for widening the activity spectrum and/or for protecting crop plants (for example by safeners, antidotes).<br>
In general, formulations of active compounds for crop protection should have high chemical and physical stability, should be easy to apply and easy to use and have broad biological action combined with high selectivity.<br>
In general, herbicidally active compounds from the group of the sulfonamides have high chemical reactivity and tend to be degraded chemically, for example by hydrolysis.<br>
One possibility of formulating chemically unstable active compounds is the preparation of solid formulations. Thus, formulations of active compounds from the group of the sulfonamides, in the form of powders, granules and tablets are known (for example in EP 764404, WO 9834482, WO 9313658). However, the processes for preparing solid formulations, for example in the form of granules and tablets, are generally complicated, in particular when auxiliaries and additives or active<br><br>
compounds having a low melting point are incorporated. Moreover, solid formulations are generally more difficult to apply and less user-friendly. Liquid formulations of sulfonamides are described, for example, in US 4599412, US 4683000, US 4671817, EP 0245058, WO 01/82693, EP 0313317, EP 0514768, EP 0163598 and EP 0514769. Thienylsulfonamides are described, for example, in WO 01/05788, WO 03/026426 and WO 03/026427.<br>
It was an object of the present invention to provide an improved formulation of crop protection agents, which formulation has a high chemical and physical stability.<br>
This object is achieved by the specific oil suspension concentrate of the present invention.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to an oil suspension concentrate comprising<br>
a)	one or more herbicidally active compounds from the group of the thienylsulfonamides, preferably in suspended form, and<br>
b)	one or more organic solvents.<br>
In addition, the oil suspension concentrate according to the invention may optionally also comprise, as further components:<br>
c)	one or more safeners,<br>
d)	one or more sulfosuccinates,<br>
e)	one or more agrochemically active compounds differing from a) and c),<br>
f)	one or more inorganic salts, and<br>
g)	customary auxiliaries and additives.<br>
The term "oil suspension concentrate" (OD) is to be understood as meaning a suspension concentrate based on organic solvents. Here, one or more active compounds are suspended in the organic solvent, further active compounds may be dissolved in the organic solvents.<br><br>
In the oil suspension concentrate according to the invention, the thienylsulfonamide a) is present in suspended form in the organic solvent. This means that the major portion (in % by weight) of thienylsulfonamide a) is present undissolved in finely distributed form, a minor portion of the thienylsulfonamide a) may be dissolved. Preferably, more than 50% by weight, particularly preferably more than 80% by weight, very particularly preferably more than 90% by weight, of the thienylsulfonamide a) are suspended in the organic solvent, in each case based on the total amount of thienylsulfonamide a) in the oil suspension concentrate according to the invention.<br>

- and salts of the compounds of the formula (I).<br>
Particular preference is given to thienylsulfonylaminocarbonyltriazolinones, for example to the compounds of the formula (II) mentioned below which are known, for example, from WO 03/026427,<br><br><br><br><br>
For the purpose of the present invention, the thienylsulfonamides contained as component a) in the oil suspension concentrates according to the invention are in each case to be understood as meaning all use forms, such as acids, esters, salts and isomers, such as stereoisomers and optical isomers. Thus, in addition to neutral compounds, their salts for example with inorganic and/or organic counterions are in each case meant to be included. Thus, sulfonamides are capable of forming salts,<br><br>
for example, in which the hydrogen of the -SO2-NH group is replaced by an agriculturally suitable cation. These salts are, for example, metal salts, in particular alkali metal salts or alkaline earth metal salts, in particular sodium and potassium salts, or else ammonium salts or salts with organic amines. Salt formation may also take place by addition of an acid to basic groups, such as, for example, amino and alkylamino. Acids suitable for this purpose are strong inorganic and organic acids, for example HCI, HBr, H2SO4 or HNO3. Preferred esters are the alkyl esters, in particular the d-Cio-alkyl esters, such as methyl esters.<br>
Whenever the term "acyl radical" is used in this description, this means the radical of an organic acid which is formally formed by removing an OH group from the organic acid, for example the radical of a carboxylic acid and radicals of acids derived therefrom, such as thiocarboxylic acid, unsubstituted or N-substituted iminocarboxylic acids or the radicals of carbonic monoesters, unsubstituted or N-substituted carbaminic acids, sulfonic acids, sulfinic acids, phosphonic acids, phosphinic acids.<br>
An acyl radical is preferably formyl or acyl from the group consisting of CO-R2, CS-RZ, C0-0R2, CS-ORz, CS-SRz, SORz and S02Rz, where RZ is in each case a CrCio-hydrocarbon radical, such as CrCio-alkyl or C6-Cio-aryl, which is unsubstituted or substituted, for example by one or more substituents from the group consisting of halogen, such as F, CI, Br, I, alkoxy, haloalkoxy, hydroxyl, amino, nitro, cyano and alkylthio, or Rz is aminocarbonyl or aminosulfonyl, where the two last-mentioned radicals are unsubstituted, N-monosubstituted or N,N-disubstituted, for example by substituents from the group consisting of alkyl and aryl. Acyl is, for example, formyl, haloalkylcarbonyl, alkylcarbonyl, such as (CrC4)-alkyl-carbonyl, phenylcarbonyl, where the phenyl ring may be substituted, or alkyloxy-carbonyl, such as (CrC4)-alkyloxycarbonyl, phenyloxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, alkylsulfonyl, such as (CrC4)-alkylsulfonyl, alkylsulfinyl, such as CrC4-(alkylsulfinyl), N-alkyl-1-iminoalkyl, such as N-(Ci-C4)-1-imino-(CrC4)-alkyl, and other radicals of organic acids.<br><br>

A heterocyclic radical or ring (heterocyclyl) can be saturated, unsaturated or heteroaromatic and unsubstituted or substituted; it preferably contains one or more heteroatoms in the ring, preferably from the group consisting of N, O and S; it is preferably an aliphatic heterocyclyl radical having 3 to 7 ring atoms or a heteroaromatic radical having 5 or 6 ring atoms and contains 1, 2 or 3 heteroatoms. The heterocyclic radical can, for example, be a heteroaromatic radical or ring (heteroaryl), such as, for example, a mono-, bi- or polycyclic aromatic system in which at least one ring contains one or more heteroatoms, for example pyridyl, pyrimidinyl, pyridazinyl, pyrazinyl, triazinyl, thienyl, thiazolyl, oxazolyl, furyl, pyrrolyl, pyrazolyl and imidazolyl, or it is a partially or fully hydrogenated radical, such as oxiranyl, oxetanyl, pyrrolidyl, piperidyl, piperazinyl, triazolyl, dioxolanyl, morpholinyl, tetrahydrofuryl.

The oxo group may also be present at the hetero ring atoms, which may exist in different oxidation states, for example in the case of N and S.<br>
Substituted radicals, such as substituted hydrocarbon radicals, for example substituted alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aryl, phenyl and benzyl, or substituted heterocyclyl or heteroaryl, are, for example, a substituted radical which is derived from an<br><br>

In these radicals, preference is given to the lower carbon skeletons having, for example, 1 to 6 carbon atoms and, in the case of unsaturated groups, 2 to 6 carbon atoms, unless specified otherwise. Alkyl radicals, also in the composite meanings such as alkoxy,<br><br>
haloalkyl, etc., are, for example, methyl, ethyl, n- or isopropyl, rv, iso, t- or 2-butyl, pentyls, hexyls, such as n-hexyl, isohexyl and 1,3-dimethylbutyl, heptyls, such as n-heptyl, 1-methylhexyl and 1,4-dimethyIpentyl; alkenyl and alkynyl radicals have the meaning of the possible unsaturated radicals which correspond to the alkyl radicals; alkenyl is, for example, allyl, 1-methylprop-2-en-1-yl, 2-methyl-prop-2-en-1-yl, but-2-en-1-yl, but-3-en-1-yl, 1-methyl-but-3-en-1-yl and 1-methyl-but-2-en-1-yI; alkynyl is, for example, propargyl, but-2-yn-1-yl, but-3-yn-1-yl, 1-methyl-but-3-yn-1-yl.<br>

For the purpose of the present invention, the term "vegetable oils" is to be understood as meaning, for example, oils of oleaginous plant species, such as soybean oil, rapeseed oil, corn oil, sunflower oil, cottonseed oil, linseed oil, coconut oil, palm oil, thistle oil, walnut oil, arachis oil, olive oil or castor oil, in particular rapeseed oil, where the vegetable oils also include their transesterification products, for example alkyl esters, such as rapeseed oil methyl ester or rapeseed oil ethyl ester.<br>
The vegetable oils are preferably esters of C10-C22-, preferably C12-C20-, fatty acids. The Ci0-C22-fatty acid esters are, for example, esters of unsaturated or saturated Cio-C22-fatty acids having, in particular, an even number of carbon atoms, for example erucic acid, lauric acid, palmitic acid and in particular C-i8-fatty acids such as stearic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid or linolenic acid.<br>
Examples of vegetable oils are Ci0-C22-fatty acid esters of glycerol or glycol with Cio-C22-fatty acids, or Cio-C22-fatty acid CrC2o-alkyl esters which can be obtained, for example, by transesterification of the glycerol or glycol Ci0-C22-fatty acid esters mentioned above with CrC2o-alcohols (for example methanol, ethanol, propanol or butanol). The transesterification can be carried out by known methods as described, for example, in Rompp Chemie Lexikon, 9th edition,<br><br>
volume 2, page 1343, Thieme Verlag Stuttgart.<br>
The vegetable oils can be contained in the oil suspension concentrates according to the invention for example in the form of commercially available vegetable oils, in particular rapeseed oils, such as rapeseed oil methyl ester, for example Phytorob® B (Novance, France), Edenor® MESU and the Agnique® ME series (Cognis, Germany) the Radia® series (ICI), the Prilube® series (Petrofina), or biodiesel or in the form of commercially available plant-oil-containing formulation additives, in particular those based on rapeseed oils, such as rapeseed oil methyl esters, for example Hasten® (Victorian Chemical Company, Australia, hereinbelow referred to as Hasten, main ingredient: rapeseed oil ethyl ester), Actirob® B (Novance, France, hereinbelow referred to as Actirob B, main ingredient: rapeseed oil methyl ester), Rako-Binol® (Bayer AG, Germany, hereinbelow referred to as Rako-Binol, main ingredient: rapeseed oil), Renol® (Stefes, Germany, hereinbelow referred to as Renol, vegetable oil ingredient: rapeseed oil methyl ester) or Stefes Mero® (Stefes, Germany, hereinbelow referred to as Mero, main ingredient: rapeseed oil methyl ester).<br>
Examples of synthetic fatty acid esters are, for example, those derived from fatty acids having an odd number of carbon atoms, such as Cn-C2i-fatty acid esters.<br>
Preferred organic solvents b) are aromatic hydrocarbons and/or aliphatic hydrocarbons and fatty acid esters, such as vegetable oils, such as triglycerides of fatty acids having 10 to 22 carbon atoms, which may be saturated or else unsaturated, straight-chain or branched and which may or may not carry further functional groups, such as corn oil, rapeseed oil, sunflower oil, cottonseed oil, linseed oil, soybean oil, coconut oil, palm oil, thistle oil or castor oil, and their transesterification products, such as fatty acid alkyl esters, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The solvents may be present on their own or as a mixture. The solubilizing power of the solvent or solvent mixture used for the thienylsulfonamide(s) used (component a) is preferably low.<br><br>
The total proportion of solvents in the oil suspension concentrates according to the invention is generally between 5 and 95% by weight, preferably in the range between 20 and 80% by weight. The proportion of polar solvents such as aprotic polar solvents is generally below 20% by weight, preferably in the range from 0 to 10% by weight.<br>

All of the above combinations may also comprise one or more agrochemically active compounds (e), in particular those selected from the group consisting of (E1), (E2), (E3), (E4), (E5), (E6), (E7), (E8), (E9), (E10), (E11), (E12), (E13), (E14), (E15), (E16), (E17), (E18), (E19), (E20), (E21), (E22), (E23), (E24), (E25), (E26), (E27), (E28) and (E29).<br><br>
The above combinations may furthermore also comprise one or more sulfosuccinates d) and/or one or more inorganic salts f), and also customary auxiliaries and additives g).<br>
If the oil suspension concentrates according to the invention comprise, as component a), a plurality of thienylsulfonamides, for example mixtures of thienylsulfonamides of the formula (I) or (II) and/or their salts, at least one of the thienylsulfonamides is present in suspended form, but it is also possible for all thienylsulfonamides to be present in suspended form.<br>
The oil suspension concentrates according to the invention can be prepared by known processes, for example by mixing the components. Thus, it is possible, for example, to prepare a premix by dissolving the optional sulfosuccinate d) in the organic solvent b) and, if appropriate, adding further auxiliaries and additives g) to this solution. Any soluble agrochemically active compounds c) and e) used are then dissolved in the premix. Once this dissolution process has ended, solid thienylsulfonamide a) and, if appropriate, any insoluble active compounds c) and e) used are suspended in the mixture. The coarse suspension is, if appropriate after pregrinding, subjected to fine grinding.<br>
In another embodiment, solid thienylsulfonamide a) and, if appropriate, any insoluble components c), e) and g) used are suspended in the organic solvent b) which optionally contains a sulfosuccinate d) and subjected to grinding. Any soluble active compounds c) and e) used and any auxiliaries and additives from g) which do not require grinding or are not required for the grinding process are added after grinding.<br>
To prepare the mixtures, it is possible to use customary mixing apparatus which, if required, are thermostatted. For pregrinding, it is possible to use, for example, high-pressure homogenizers or mills operating by the rotor-stator principle, such as Ultraturrax homogenizers, for example those from IKA, or toothed colloid mills, for example from Puck. For fine grinding, it is possible to use, for example, bead mills<br><br>
which operate batch-wise, for example from Drais, or bead mills which operate continuously, for example from Bachofen. The preparation process can be adapted to the properties of the components employed and to technical and safety requirements and to economical considerations, and pregrinding and even fine grinding may be dispensed with, if required.<br>
The components a) to f) used for the preparation may comprise water as a minor component which is then also found in the oil suspension concentrates according to the invention. Accordingly, the oil suspension concentrates according to the invention may comprise small amounts of water, in general from 0 to 5% by weight. Preferably, the oil suspension concentrates according to the invention are not subjected to any drying.<br>
For application, the oil suspension concentrates according to the invention may, if required, be diluted to herbicidal compositions in a customary manner (using, for example, water), to give, for example, suspensions, emulsions, suspoemulsions or solutions, preferably suspoemulsions or emulsions. It may be advantageous to add further agrochemically active compounds (for example tank mix components in the form of appropriate formulations) and/or auxiliaries and additives customary for application, for example self-emulsifying oils, such as vegetable oils or paraffin oils, and/or fertilizers to the spray liquors obtained. Accordingly, the present invention also provides such herbicidal compositions based on the oil suspension concentrates according to the invention.<br>
The herbicidal compositions according to the invention have outstanding herbicidal activity against a broad spectrum of economically important monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous harmful plants. Even perennial weeds which produce shoots from rhizomes, rootstocks or other perennial organs and which are difficult to control are controlled well. In this context, it does not matter whether the substances are applied before sowing, pre-emergence or post-emergence. Specific examples may be mentioned of some representatives of the monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous weed flora which can be controlled by the herbicidal compositions according to the<br><br>
invention, without the enumeration being a restriction to certain species.<br>
Examples of monocotyledonous weed species on which the herbicidal compositions act efficiently are Apera spica venti, Avena spp., Alopecurus spp., Brachiaria spp., Digitaria spp., Lolium spp., Echinochloa spp., Panicum spp., Phalaris spp., Poa spp., Setaria spp. and Bromus spp. such as Bromus catharticus, Bromus secalinus, Bromus erectus, Bromus tectorum and Bromus japonicus, and Cyperus species from the annual group, and, among the perennial species, Agropyron, Cynodon, Imperata and Sorghum and also perennial Cyperus species.<br>
In the case of the dicotyledonous weed species, the spectrum of action extends to genera such as, for example, Abutilon spp., Amaranthus spp., Chenopodium spp., Chrysanthemum spp., Galium spp. such as Galium aparine, Ipomoea spp., Kochia spp., Lamium spp., Matricaria spp., Pharbitis spp., Polygonum spp., Sida spp., Sinapis spp., Solanum spp., Stellaria spp., Veronica spp. and Viola spp., Xanthium spp., among the annuals, and Convolvulus, Cirsium, Rumex and Artemisia in the case of the perennial weeds.<br>
The compositions according to the invention also act outstandingly efficiently on harmful plants which are found under the specific cultures in rice, such as, for example, Echinochloa, Sagittaria, Alisma, Eleocharis, Scirpus and Cyperus.<br>
If the herbicidal compositions according to the invention are applied to the soil surface before germination, the weed seedlings are either prevented completely from emerging or else the weeds grow until they have reached the cotyledon stage, but then their growth stops, and, eventually, after three to four weeks have elapsed, they die completely.<br>
If the herbicidal compositions according to the invention are applied post-emergence to the green parts of the plants, growth likewise stops drastically a very short time after the treatment, and the weed plants remain at the growth stage of the point of time of application, or they die completely after a certain time, so that in this manner competition by the weeds, which is harmful to the crop plants, is eliminated very<br><br>
early and in a sustained manner.<br>
The herbicidal compositions according to the invention are distinguished by a rapidly commencing and long-lasting herbicidal action. As a rule, the rainfastness of the active substances in the combinations according to the invention is advantageous. A particular advantage is that the dosages used in the herbicidal compositions and the effective dosages of herbicidal compounds can be adjusted to such a low level that their soil action is optimally low. This not only allows them to be employed in sensitive crops in the first place, but groundwater contaminations are virtually avoided. The active compound combination according to the invention allows the required application rate of the active substances to be reduced considerably.<br>
The abovementioned properties and advantages are necessary for weed control practice to keep agricultural crops free from undesired competing plants, and thus to ensure and/or increase yield levels from the qualitative and quantitative angle. These novel compositions markedly exceed the technical state of the art with a view to the properties described.<br>
While the herbicidal compositions according to the invention have an outstanding herbicidal activity against monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous weeds, crop plants of economically important crops, for example dicotyledonous crops such as soybean, cotton, oilseed rape, sugar beet, or graminaceous crops such as wheat, barley, rye, oats, millet, rice or corn, are damaged only to a minor extent, if at all. This is why the present compounds are highly suitable for the selective control of undesired plant growth in plantations of agricultural crops or of ornamentals.<br>
In addition, the herbicidal compositions according to the invention have outstanding growth-regulatory properties in crop plants. They engage in the plants' metabolism in a regulatory manner and can thus be employed for provoking direct effects on plant constituents and to facilitate harvesting such as, for example, by triggering desiccation and stunted growth. Moreover, they are also suitable for the general control and inhibition of undesired vegetative growth without simultaneously<br><br>
destroying the plants. Inhibition of vegetative growth is very important in a large number of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous crops since lodging can thus be reduced, or prevented completely.<br>
By virtue of their herbicidal and plant-growth-regulatory properties, the herbicidal compositions according to the invention can also be employed for controlling harmful plants in crops of genetically modified plants which are known or yet to be developed. As a rule, the recombinant plants are distinguished by specific advantageous characteristics, for example by resistances to certain pesticides, in particular certain herbicides, resistances to plant diseases or the causative organisms of plant diseases such as specific insects or microorganisms such as fungi, bacteria or viruses. Other specific characteristics relate, for example, to the harvested material with regard to quantity, quality, storability, composition and specific constituents. Thus, for example, transgenic plants are known whose starch content is increased, or whose starch quality is altered, or those where the harvested material has a different fatty acid composition.<br>
The use of the compositions according to the invention in economically important transgenic crops of useful plants and ornamentals, for example of graminaceous crops such as wheat, barley, rye, oats, millet, rice and corn, or else crops of sugar beet, cotton, soybean, oilseed rape, potatoes, tomatoes, peas and other vegetables, is preferred. Preferably, the compositions according to the invention can be employed as herbicides in crops of useful plants which resist the phytotoxic effects of the herbicides, or have been made to resist these effects by recombinant techniques.<br>
When using the herbicidal compositions according to the invention in transgenic crops, effects are frequently observed in addition to the effects against harmful plants to be observed in other crops, which are specific for the application in the transgenic crop in question, for example a modified or specifically widened weed spectrum which can be controlled, modified application rates which may be employed for application, preferably good combining ability with the herbicides to<br><br>
which the transgenic crop is resistant, and an effect on growth and yield level of the transgenic crop plants.<br>
The present invention therefore furthermore also relates to a method for controlling undesired vegetation, preferably in crops of plants such as cereals (for example wheat, barley, rye, oats, rice, corn and millet), sugar beet, sugar cane, oilseed rape, cotton and soybean, especially preferred in monocotyledonous plants such as cereals, for example wheat, barley, rye, oats, and their hybrids such as triticale, rice, corn and millet, where one or more herbicidal compositions according to the invention are applied to the harmful plants, plant parts, seeds of the plants or the area on which the plants grow, for example the area under cultivation.<br>
The plant crops may also be genetically modified or have been obtained by mutation selection; they preferably tolerate acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibitors.<br>
The oil suspension concentrate of the present invention has excellent chemical stability during preparation and storage and is suitable in particular also for combinations of active compounds having different physicochemical properties, for example of a herbicidal thienylsulfonamide which is poorly soluble in organic solvents with a soluble safener and, if appropriate, further soluble agrochemically active compounds. Moreover, the oil suspension concentrate has excellent physical stability, is easy to apply and easy to use and has high biological effectiveness and crop plant compatibility (selectivity).<br>
The oil suspension concentrates described in the examples below were prepared as follows: a premix was prepared in which all soluble components from d), f) and g) and also, if appropriate, the thickener were homogeneously distributed in the solvent or solvent mixture b). Soluble active compounds c) and e) were then dissolved in the premix. Following the dissolution process, solid thienylsulfonamide a) and further insoluble components from c) to g) were suspended in the mixture. The coarse suspension was, after pregrinding, subjected to fine grinding.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
