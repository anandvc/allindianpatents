"COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS FOR RECOVERING HYDROCARBON FLUTOS<br>
FROM A SUBTERRANEAN RESERVOIR"<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0001] In the first stage of hydrocarbon recovery the sources of energy present in the<br>
reservoir are allowed to move the oil, gas, condensate etc. to the producing wells(s) where they<br>
can flow or be pumped to the surface handling facility. A relatively small proportion of the<br>
hydrocarbon in place can usually be recovered by this means. The most widely used solution to<br>
the problem of maintaining the energy in the reservoir and ensuring that hydrocarbon is driven to<br>
the producing well(s) is to inject fluids down adjacent wells. This is commonly known as<br>
secondary recovery.<br>
[0002] The fluids normally used are water (such as aquifer water, river water, sea water,<br>
or produced water), or gas (such as produced gas, carbon dioxide, flue gas and various others). If<br>
the fluid encourages movement of normally immobile residual oil or other hydrocarbon, the<br>
process is commonly termed tertiary recovery.<br>
[0003] A very prevalent problem with secondary and tertiary recovery projects relates to<br>
the heterogeneity of the reservoir rock strata. The mobility of the injected fluid is commonly<br>
different from the hydrocarbon and when it is more mobile various mobility control processes<br>
have been used to make the sweep of the reservoir more uniform and the consequent<br>
hydrocarbon recovery more efficient. Such processes have limited value when high permeability<br>
zones, commonly called thief zones or streaks, exist within the reservoir rock. The injected fluid<br>
has a low resistance route from the injection to the production well. In such cases the injected<br>
fluid does not effectively sweep the hydrocarbon fluids from adjacent, lower permeability zones.<br>
When the produced fluid is re-used this can lead to fluid cycling through the thief zone to little<br>
benefit and at great cost in terms of fuel and maintenance of the pumping system.<br>
[0004] Numerous physical and chemical methods have been used to divert injected fluids<br>
out of thief zones in or near production and injection wells. When the treatment is applied to a<br>
producing well it is usually termed a water (or gas etc.) shut-off treatment. When it is applied to<br>
an injection well it is termed a profile control or conformance control treatment.<br>
[0005] In cases where the thief zone(s) are isolated from the lower permeability adjacent<br>
zones and when the completion in the well forms a good seal with the barrier (such as a shale<br>
layer or "stringer") causing the isolation, mechanical seals or "plugs" can be set in the well to<br>
block the entrance of the injected fluid. If the fluid enters or leaves the formation from the<br>
bottom of the well, cement can also be used to fill up the well bore to above the zone of ingress.<br>
1<br>
[0006] When the completion of the well allows the injected fluid to enter both the thief<br>
and the adjacent zones, such as when a casing is cemented against the producing zone and the<br>
cement job is poorly accomplished, a cement squeeze is often a suitable means of isolating the<br>
watered out zone.<br>
[0007] Certain cases are not amenable to such methods by virtue of the facts that<br>
communication exists between layers of the reservoir rock outside the reach of cement. Typical<br>
examples of this are when fractures or rubble zones or washed out caverns exist behind the<br>
casing. In such instances chemical gels, capable of moving through pores in reservoir rock have<br>
been applied to seal off the swept out zones.<br>
[0008] When such methods fail the only alternatives remaining are to produce the well<br>
with poor recovery rate, sidetrack the well away from the prematurely swept zone, or the<br>
abandon the well. Occasionally the producing well is converted to a fluid injector to increase the<br>
field injection rate above the net hydrocarbon extraction rate and increase the pressure in the<br>
reservoir. This can lead to improved overall recovery but it is worthy of note that the injected<br>
fluid will mostly enter the thief zone at the new injector and is likely to cause similar problems in<br>
nearby wells. All of these are expensive options.<br>
[0009] Near wellbore conformance control methods always fail when the thief zone is in<br>
widespread contact with the adjacent, hydrocarbon containing, lower permeability zones. The<br>
reason for this is that the injected fluids can bypass the treatment and re-enter the thief zone<br>
having only contacted a very small proportion, or even none of the remaining hydrocarbon. It is<br>
commonly known amongst tliose skilled in the art, that such near wellbore treatments do not<br>
succeed in significantly improving recovery in reservoirs having crossfiow of the injected fluids<br>
between zones.<br>
[0010] A few processes have been developed with the aim of reducing the permeability in<br>
a substantial proportion of the thief zone and, or at a significant distance from the injection and<br>
production wells. One example of this is the Deep Diverting Gel process patented by Morgan et<br>
al (1). This has been used in the field and suffered from sensitivity to unavoidable variations in<br>
quality of the reagents which resulted in poor propagation. The gelant mixture is a two<br>
component formulation and it is believed that this contributed to poor propagation of the<br>
treatment into the formation.<br>
[0011] The use of swellable cross linked superabsorbent polymer microparticles for<br>
modifying the permeability of subterranean formations is disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,465,792<br>
and 5,735,349. However, swelling of the superabsorbent microparticles described therein is<br>
2<br>
induced by changes of the carrier fluid from hydrocarbon to aqueous or from water of high<br>
salinity to water of low salinity.<br>
[0012] Cross linked, expandable polymeric microparticles and their use for modifying the<br>
permeability of subterranean formations and increasing the mobilization and/or recovery rate of<br>
hydrocarbon fluids present in the formation are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,454,003 Bl;<br>
6,709,402 B2; 6,984,705 B2 and 7,300,973 B2 and in published U.S. Patent Application No.<br>
2007/0204989 Al.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0013] We have discovered novel polymeric microparticles in which the microparticle<br>
conformation is constrained by reversible (labile) internal crosslinks. The microparticle<br>
properties; such as particle size distribution and density, of the constrained microparticle are<br>
designed to allow efficient propagation through the pore structure of hydrocarbon reservoir<br>
matrix rock, such as sandstone. On heating to reservoir temperature and/or at a predetermined<br>
pH, the reversible (labile) internal crosslinks start to break allowing the particle to expand by<br>
absorbing the injection fluid (normally water).<br>
[0014] The ability of the particle to expand from its original size (at the point of<br>
injection) depends only on the presence of conditions that induce the breaking of the labile<br>
crosslinker. It does not depend on the nature of the carrier fluid or the salinity of the reservoir<br>
water. The particles of this invention can propagate through the porous structure of the reservoir<br>
without using a designated fluid or fluid with salinity higher than the reservoir fluid.<br>
[0015] The expanded particle is engineered to have a particle size distribution and<br>
physical characteristics, for example, particle rheology, which allow it to impede the flow of<br>
injected fluid in me pore structure. In doing so it is capable of diverting chase fluid into less<br>
thoroughly swept zones of the reservoir.<br>
[0016] The rheology and expanded particle size of the particle can be designed to suit the<br>
reservoir target, for example by suitable selection of the backbone monomers or comonomer ratio<br>
of the polymer, or the degree of reversible (labile) and irreversible crosslinking introduced during<br>
manufacture.<br>
[0017] In an embodiment, the present disclosure is directed to compositions comprising<br>
at least two different highly cross linked expandable polymeric microparticles having different<br>
chemical structures and having unexpanded volume average particle size diameters of from about<br>

ppm of labile cross linkers and from 0 to about 300 ppm of non-labile cross linkers.<br>
[0018] In another embodiment, the present disclosure is directed toward compositions<br>
comprising highly cross linked expandable polymeric microparticles having different chemical<br>
structures and having unexpanded volume average particle size diameters of from about 0.05 to<br>
about 5,000 microns and cross linking agent contents of from about 100 to about 200,000 ppm of<br>
labile cross linkers and from 0 to about 300 ppm of non-labile cross linkers, and a viscosified<br>
aqueous solution.<br>
[0019] In yet another embodiment, the present disclosure is directed toward compositions<br>

structures and having unexpanded volume average particle size diameters of from about 0.05 to<br>
about 5,000 microns and cross linking agent contents of from about 100 to about 200,000 ppm of<br>
labile cross linkers and from 0 to about 300 ppm of non-labile cross linkers, and at least one<br>
subterranean reservoir treatment.<br>
[0020] In still yet another embodiment, the present disclosure is directed toward<br>
compositions comprising at least two different highly cross linked expandable polymeric<br>
microparticles having unexpanded volume average particle size diameters of about 0.05 to about<br>

linkers and from 0 to about 300 ppm of non-labile cross linkers, wherein the at least two different<br>
highly cross linked expandable polymeric microparticles have different cross linking agent<br>
contents.<br>

6<br>
surfactant. See, U.S. Pat. No. 3,734,873, the entire content of which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
[0032] "Fluid mobility" means a ratio that defines how readily a fluid moves through a<br>
porous medium. This ratio is known as the mobility and is expressed as the ratio of the<br>
permeability of the porous medium to the viscosity for a given fluid.<br>
1. 2 = — for a single fluid x flowing in a porous medium.<br>
[0033] When more than one fluid is flowing the end point relative permeabilities must be<br>
substituted for the absolute permeability used in equation 1.<br>
2. /L = — for a fluid x flowing in a porous medium in the presence of one or more<br>
other fluids.<br>
[0034] When two or more fluids are flowing the fluid mobilities may be used to define a<br>
Mobility ratio.<br>
_ Ax TJykrx<br>
3. M = — =<br>
Ay TpcKry<br>
[0035] The mobility ratio is of use in the study of fluid displacement, for example in<br>
water flooding of an oil reservoir where x is water and y is oil, because the efficiency of the<br>
displacement process can be related to it. As a general principle at a mobility ratio of 1 the fluid<br>
front moves almost in a "plug flow" manner and the sweep of the reservoir is good. When the<br>
mobility of the water is ten times greater than the oil viscous instabilities, known as fingering,<br>
develop and the sweep of the reservoir is poor. When the mobility of the oil is ten times greater<br>
than the water the sweep of the reservoir is almost total.<br>

degraded by certain conditions of heat and/or pH, after it has been incorporated into the polymer<br>
structure, to reduce the degree of crosslinking in the polymeric microparticle of this invention.<br>

[0039] "Monomer" means a polymerizable allylic, vinylic or acrylic compound. The<br>

non-labile cross linker is present in an amount from about 0 to about 100 ppm. In another<br>
embodiment, the non-labile cross linker is present in an amount of from about 5 to about 300<br>
ppm. In another embodiment, the non-labile cross linker is present in an amount of from about 2<br>
to about 300 ppm. In another embodiment, the non-labile cross linker is present in an amount of<br>
from about 0.1 to about 300 ppm. In the absence of a non-labile cross linker, the polymer<br>
particle, upon complete scission of labile cross linker, is converted into a mixture of linear<br>
polymer strands. The particle dispersion is thereby changed into a polymer solution. This<br>
polymer solution, due to its viscosity, changes the mobility of the fluid in a porous medium. In<br>
the presence of a small amount of non-labile cross linker, the conversion from particles to linear<br>
molecules is incomplete. The particles become a loosely linked network but retain certain<br>
'structure.' Such 'structured' particles can block the pore throats of porous media and create a<br>
blockage of flow.<br>
[0043] In an aspect of the present disclosure, the polymeric microparticles of this<br>
disclosure are prepared using an inverse emulsion or microemulsion process to assure certain<br>
particle size range. In an embodiment, the unexpanded volume average particle size diameter of<br>
the polymeric microparticles is from about 0.05 to about 5,000 microns. In an embodiment, the<br>
unexpanded volume average particle size diameter of the polymeric microparticles is from about<br>
0.1 to about 3 microns. In another embodiment, the unexpanded volume average particle size<br>
diameter of the polymeric microparticles is from 0.1 to about 1 microns. In yet another<br>
embodiment, the unexpanded volume average particle size diameter of the polymeric<br>
microparticles is from about 0.05 to about 50 microns.<br>
[0044] Representative preparations of cross-linked polymeric microparticles using<br>
microemulsion process are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,956,400; 4,968,435; 5,171,808;<br>
5,465,792 and 5,737,349.<br>
[0045] In an inverse emulsion or microemulsion process, an aqueous solution of<br>
monomers and cross linkers is added to a hydrocarbon liquid containing an appropriate surfactant<br>
or surfactant mixture to form an inverse monomer microemulsion consisting of small aqueous<br>
9<br>
droplets dispersed in the continuous hydrocarbon liquid phase and subjecting the monomer<br>
microemulsion to free radical polymerization.<br>
[0046] In addition to the monomers and cross linkers, the aqueous solution may also<br>
contain other conventional additives including chelating agents to remove polymerization<br>
inhibitors, pH adjusters, initiators and other conventional additives.<br>
[0047] The hydrocarbon liquid phase comprises a hydrocarbon liquid or mixture of<br>
hydrocarbon liquids. Saturated hydrocarbons or mixtures thereof are preferred. Typically, the<br>
hydrocarbon liquid phase comprises benzene, toluene, fuel oil, kerosene, odorless mineral spirits<br>
and mixtures of any of the foregoing.<br>
[0048] Surfactants useful in the microemulsion polymerization process described herein<br>
include sorbitan esters of fatty acids, ethoxylated sorbitan esters of fatty acids, and the like or<br>
mixtures thereof. Preferred emulsifying agents include ethoxylated sorbitol oleate and sorbitan<br>
sesquioleate. Additional details on these agents may be found in McCutcheon's Detergents and<br>
Emulsifiers, North American Edition, 1980.<br>
[0049] Polymerization of the emulsion may be carried out in any manner known to those<br>
skilled in the art. Initiation may be effected with a variety of thermal and redox free-radical<br>
initiators including azo compounds, such as azobisisobutyronitrile; peroxides, such as t-butyl<br>
peroxide; organic compounds, such as potassium persulfatc and redox couples, such as sodium<br>
bisulfite/sodium bromate. Preparation of an aqueous product from the emulsion may be effected<br>
by inversion by adding it to water which may contain an inverting surfactant.<br>
[0050] Alternatively, the polymeric microparticles cross linked with labile cross links are<br>
prepared by internally cross linking polymer particles which contain polymers with pendant<br>
carboxylic acid and hydroxyl groups. The cross linking is achieved through the ester formation<br>
between the carboxylic acid and hydroxyl groups. The esterification can be accomplished by<br>
azeotropic distillation (U.S. Pat. No. 4,599,379) or thin film evaporation technique (U.S. Pat. No.<br>
5,589,525) for water removal. For example, a polymer microparticle prepared from inverse<br>
emulsion polymerization process using acrylic acid, 2-hydroxyethylacryIate, acrylamide and 2-<br>
acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonate sodium as monomer is converted into cross linked<br>
polymer particles by the dehydration processes described above.<br>
[0051] The polymeric microparticles are optionally prepared in dry form by adding the<br>
emulsion to a solvent which precipitates the polymer such as isopropanol, isopropanol/acetone or<br>
methanol/acetone or other solvents or solvent mixtures that are miscible with both hydrocarbon<br>
and water and filtering off and drying the resulting solid.<br>
10<br>
[0052] An aqueous suspension of the polymeric microparticles is prepared by<br>
redispersing the dry polymer in water.<br>
[0053] Upon injection into a subterranean formation, the polymeric microparticles flow<br>
through the zone or zones of relatively high permeability in the subterranean formation under<br>
increasing temperature conditions, until the composition reaches a location where the<br>
temperature or pH is sufficiently high to promote expansion of the microparticles.<br>
[0054] Unlike conventional blocking agents such as polymer solutions and polymer gels<br>
that cannot penetrate far and deep into the formation, the composition of this invention, due to<br>
the size of the particles and low viscosity, can propagate far from the injection point until it<br>
encounters the high temperature zone.<br>
[0055] Also, the polymeric microparticles of this invention, due to their highly<br>
crosslinked nature, do not expand in solutions of different salinity. Consequently, the viscosity<br>
of the dispersion is not affected by the salinity of the fluid encountered in the subterranean<br>
formation. Accordingly, no special carrier fluid is needed for treatment. Only after the particles<br>
encounter conditions sufficient to reduce the crossl inking density, is the fluid rheology changed<br>
to achieve the desired effect.<br>
[0056] Among other factors, the reduction in crosslinking density is dependent on the rate<br>
of cleavage of the labile cross linker. In particular, different labile crossllnkers, have different<br>
rates of bond cleavage at different temperatures. The temperature and mechanism depend on the<br>
nature of the cross-linking chemical bonds. For example, when the labile cross linker is PEG<br>
diacrylate, hydrolysis of the ester linkage is the mechanism of de-crosslinking. Different<br>
alcohols have slightly different rates of hydrolysis. In general, methacrylate esters will hydrolyze<br>
at a slower rate than acrylate esters under similar conditions. With divinyl or diallyl compounds<br>
separated by an azo group such as the diallylamide of 2,2'-Azobis(isbutyric acid), the mechanism<br>
of de-crosslinking is elimination of a nitrogen molecule. As demonstrated by various azo<br>
initiators for free radical polymerization, different azo compounds indeed have different half-life<br>
temperatures for decomposition.<br>
[0057] In addition to the rate of de-crosslinking, and without wishing to be bound to any<br>
theory, it is believed that the rate of particle diameter expansion also depends on the total amount<br>
of remaining crosslinking. We have observed that the particle expands gradually initially as the<br>
amount of crosslinking decreases. After the total amount of crosslinking passes below a certain<br>
critical density, the viscosity increases explosively. Thus, by proper selection of the labile crosslinker,<br>
both temperature- and time-dependent expansion properties can be incorporated into the<br>
polymer particles.<br>
11<br>
[0058] The particle size of the polymer particles before expansion is selected based on<br>
the calculated pore size of the highest permeability thief zone. The crosslinker type and<br>
concentration, and hence the time delay before the injected particles begin to expand, is based on<br>
the temperature both near the injection well and deeper into the formation, the expected rate of<br>
movement of injected particles through the thief zone and the ease with which water can<br>
crossflow out of the thief zone into the adjacent, lower permeability, hydrocarbon containing<br>
zones. A polymer microparticle composition designed to incorporate the above considerations<br>
results in a better water block after particle expansion, and in a more optimum position in the<br>
formation.<br>
[0059] An aspect of the present disclosure is to demonstrate the synergistic effects that<br>
result from combining the polymeric microparticles described herein with additional treatments.<br>
The additional treatments may include, for example, a second polymeric microparticle having a<br>
chemical structure that is different from a first polymeric microparticle, a viscosified aqueous<br>
solution, a subterranean reservoir treatment, and combinations thereof. The skilled artisan will<br>
appreciate that the additional treatments should not be limited to the exemplary treatments<br>
discussed herein and that any additional treatments known in the art to be useful for improving<br>
recovery of hydrocarbon fluids from a subterranean formation may be combined with polymeric<br>
microparticles for an enhanced synergistic effect, which results, at least in part, due to polymer<br>
entanglement, hydrogen bonding, electrostatic effects and Van der Waals effects.<br>
[0060] In an embodiment, at least two different polymer microparticles having different<br>
chemical structures may be used in combination or in conjunction with each other for enhanced<br>
oil recovery, for modifying the permeability of subterranean formations and for increasing the<br>
mobilization and/or recovery rate of hydrocarbon fluids present in the formations.<br>
[0061] The different polymeric microparticles may be injected separately into the<br>
subterranean formation. Alternatively, the different polymeric microparticles may be mixed or<br>
blended prior to, during, or after injection. For example, the different polymeric microparticles<br>
may be premixed prior to injection into the subterranean formation. The different polymeric<br>
microparticles may also be mixed or blended during the simultaneous injection of the two<br>
different polymeric microparticles into the subterranean formation. Further, the different<br>
polymeric microparticles may also be mixed or blended within the subterranean formation as a<br>
result of repeated, consecutive applications of each of the different polymeric microparticles.<br>
[0062] There are many benefits that may result from the use of the at least two different<br>
polymeric microparticles having unexpanded volume average particle size diameters of about<br>
0.05 to about 5,000 microns and cross linking agent contents of about 100 to about 200,000 ppm<br>
12<br>
of labile cross linkers and from 0 to about 300 ppm of non-labile cross linkers. For example, the<br>
use of at least two different polymeric microparticles having different chemical structures<br>
provides for an application dosage of expandable polymeric microparticles that contains a broad<br>
distribution of half-lives and/or microparticle sizes. This broad distribution of half-lives and/or<br>
microparticle sizes allows different fractions of the distribution of polymer microparticles to<br>
expand at different rates due to the effect of pH or temperatures, for example, thereby allowing<br>
microparticles with higher levels of labile cross linker to flow to deeper areas of the subterranean<br>
formation. As such, the blend comprises polymeric microparticles that are able to expand at<br>
different rates, which prevents the complete activation of an application of expandable polymeric<br>
microparticles at a single lower temperature thief zone. This prevention allows portions of the<br>
application dosage to flow further from the application site and deeper into the subterranean<br>
formation before activating. Further, whether the distribution of half-lives in the blended<br>
polymeric mixture is bi-modal depends upon the distribution of half-lives of the two polymers.<br>
[0063] For example, an application of a blend of at least two different unactivated<br>
microparticles can be injected into a well that contains a temperature gradient or non-uniform<br>
temperature zones. The microparticles that are sensitive to lower temperatures will activate in<br>
lower temperature zones, thus, changing the proportion of unactivated microparticles to a greater<br>
concentration of higher temperature microparticles, which will activate in higher temperature<br>
zones. As previously discussed, the difference in temperature allows portions of the application<br>
dosage to flow further from the application site and deeper into the subterranean formation before<br>
activating.<br>
[0064] The use of at least two different polymeric microparticles would also provide the<br>
benefit of a time-release effect. Specifically, the at least two polymeric microparticles would be<br>
expected to activate at different rates due to their different activation half-lives. By expanding at<br>
different rates, the polymeric microparticles would provide the benefit of filling in thief zones<br>
exposed to the microparticles over periods of time. This provides better coverage over broader<br>
areas of the thief zone and also provides for deeper penetration from the injection site of the<br>
application dose into the thief zones than would be seen with a single mix of lower temperature<br>
sensitive unactivated microparticles.<br>
[0065] Further, the use of at least two different polymeric microparticles allows<br>
unactivated expandable polymeric microparticles to be entrapped in the activated expandable<br>
polymeric microparticles. The unactivated microparticles will be held in place until action by a<br>
specific pH level or temperature degrades the labile cross-linker of the unactivated polymeric<br>
microparticles, thereby causing it to activate. This late stage activation would be expected to<br>
13<br>
provide a reinforcing effect for earlier activated microparticles. This late stage activation also<br>
provides protection against degradation, dislodgement, slippage, and/or erosion of the polymer in<br>
thief zones.<br>
[0066] In an embodiment of the present disclosure, a blend of at least two different<br>
polymeric microparticles is provided. As such, the at least two different polymeric<br>
microparticles may have any number of characteristics that differ from each other. For example,<br>
in an embodiment, the unexpanded volume average particle size diameter of a first highly cross<br>
linked expandable polymeric microparticle is greater than the unexpanded volume average<br>
particle size diameter of a second highly cross linked expandable polymeric microparticle.<br>
Similarly, in an embodiment, the labile cross linking agent content of a first highly cross linked<br>
expandable polymeric microparticle is greater than the labile cross linking agent content of a<br>
second highly cross linked expandable polymeric microparticle. In an embodiment, the nonlabile<br>
cross linking agent content of a first highly cross linked expandable polymeric<br>
microparticle is greater than the non-labile cross linking agent content of a second highly .cross<br>
linked expandable polymeric microparticle.<br>
[0067J In an embodiment, the labile cross linker is selected from diacrylates and<br>
polyfunctional vinyl derivatives of a polyalcohol. The labile cross-linker may also be<br>
polymethyleneglycol diacrylate.<br>
[0068] In an embodiment, the composition includes cross linked anionic, amphoteric,<br>
ion-pair or betaine-containing polymeric microparticles.<br>
[0069] In an embodiment, the composition is in the form of an emulsion or aqueous<br>
suspension.<br>
[0070] In an embodiment, at least one of the cross linked polymeric microparticles is<br>
anionic. The anionic polymeric microparticle may be prepared by free-radical polymerization<br>
from about 95 to about 10 mole percent of nonionic monomers and from about 5 to about 90<br>
mole percent anionic monomers. The nonionic monomer may be acrylamide and the anionic<br>
monomer may be 2-acrylamido-2-methyl-l-propanesulfonic acid.<br>
[0071] In an embodiment, the non-labile cross linker is methylene bisacrylamide.<br>
[0072] The diameter of the expanded polymeric microparticles may be greater than one<br>
tenth of the controlling pore throat radius of the rock pores in the subterranean formation.<br>
Alternatively, the diameter of the expanded polymeric microparticles may be greater than one<br>
fourth of the controlling pore throat radius of the rock pores in the subterranean formation.<br>
[0073] In another embodiment, a composition is provided that includes highly cross<br>
linked expandable polymeric microparticles having unexpanded volume average particle size<br>
14<br>
diameters of about 0.05 to about 5,000 microns and cross linking agent contents of about 100 to<br>
about 200,000 ppm of labile crosslinkers and from 0 to about 300 ppm of non-labile cross<br>
linkers, and a viscosified aqueous solution. The viscosified aqueous solution may include<br>
additives selected from the group consisting of water-soluble polymers, brines, surfactants, and<br>
combinations thereof.<br>
[0074] The viscosified aqueous solutions may be prepared by any methods known in the<br>
art to alter the viscosity of aqueous solutions. For example, the viscosified aqueous solutions<br>
may be prepared by dissolving appropriate water-soluble polymers to effectively increase<br>
solution viscosity. The solutions may also be prepared via the use of brines that can alter the<br>
density and viscosity of the solution. Further, the solutions may also be prepared by dissolving<br>
surfactants that increase solution viscosity either in fresh water or in brines. The skilled artisan<br>
will immediately appreciate that the methods described herein for altering the viscosity of<br>
aqueous solutions are for exemplary purposes only and that the methods for obtaining viscosified<br>
aqueous solutions should not be limited to the examples described herein.<br>
[0075] There are many benefits that result from the use of a blend of polymeric<br>
microparticles and a viscosified aqueous solution. For example, the addition of a second polymer<br>
solution to the unactivated polymeric microparticle will have the effect of a viscosity modifier to<br>
either increase or decrease the viscosity of the application. Either increasing or decreasing the<br>
viscosity of the polymer application will allow for very precise control of the application dosage<br>
properties to target the path of least resistance to reduce the total amount of polymeric<br>
microparticles required in each polymer application. Similar to the composition having at least<br>
two different polymeric microparticles, controlling the viscosity of a polymer application allows<br>
for variations in the rate of displacement of the unactivated polymeric microparticles from the<br>
injection site.<br>
[0076] Further, the use of a composition having polymeric microparticles and a<br>
viscosified aqueous solution can also offer additional benefits with respect to improving recovery<br>
of hydrocarbon fluids. For example, if a viscosified aqueous solution is injected prior to the<br>
injection of the polymeric microparticles, the viscosified aqueous solution can provide defined<br>
discrimination of the path of least resistance to the flow of the polymeric microparticles. As<br>
such, the injected viscosified aqueous solution provides better targeting of the main thief zone<br>
paths and aids in improving the overall effectiveness of the polymer application. Moreover, in an<br>
embodiment where the viscosified aqueous solution contains a large amount of surfactants, the<br>
viscosified aqueous solution may also provide, for example, a lubricating effect that helps to<br>
15<br>
ensure that the polymeric microparticles of the polymer application will flow further from the<br>
application site and deeper into the formation before activation.<br>
[0077] The diameter of the expanded polymeric microparticles may be greater than one<br>
tenth of the controlling pore throat radius of the rock pores in the subterranean formation.<br>
Alternatively, the diameter of the expanded polymeric microparticles may be greater than one<br>
fourth of the controlling pore throat radius of the rock pores in the subterranean formation.<br>
[0078] In yet another embodiment, a composition is provided that includes both highly<br>
cross linked expandable polymeric microparticles having unexpanded volume average particle<br>
size diameters of about 0.05 to about 5,000 microns and cross linking agent contents of about 100<br>
to about 200,000 ppm of labile crosslinkers and from 0 to about 300 ppm of non-labile cross<br>
linkers, and at least one subterranean reservoir treatment. In an embodiment, the at least one<br>
subterranean reservoir treatment is an injectable fluid. The fluid may be any fluid known in the<br>
art and used in the recovery of hydrocarbon fluids from subterranean reservoirs. For example,<br>
the fluid may be selected from the group consisting of water, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen,<br>
polymer solutions, gels, surfactants, alkaline-enhanced chemicals, acids, bases, steam, foams, and<br>
combinations thereof.<br>
[0079] Examples of subterranean reservoir treatments include both chemical and thermal<br>
treatments. Specifically, chemical treatments may include injection of fluids into the<br>
subterranean formation. The skilled artisan will appreciate that the chemicals injected into the<br>
subterranean formation may be any chemicals that are known in the art for use in recovery of<br>
hydrocarbon fluids from a subterranean reservoir and may include, for example, polymers and<br>
gels to control the movement of water and oil in the reservoir, surfactants or alkaline-enhanced<br>
chemicals that release the oil from the reservoir rock surfaces, or foams capable of displacing oil<br>
from the reservoir to the producing well. The skilled artisan will also appreciate that the gases<br>
injected into the subterranean formation may be any gases that are known in the art for use in<br>
recovery of hydrocarbon fluids from a subterranean reservoir. Thus, the gases may include, for<br>
example, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen, and combinations thereof. Similarly, the skilled<br>
artisan will also appreciate that the thermal treatments may include any thermal treatments<br>
known in the art for recovering heavy oil where heat is used to lower the viscosity of the oil.<br>
Accordingly, a thermal treatment includes, for example, the injection of steam.<br>
[0080] The addition of an unactivated polymeric microparticle to a standard enhanced oil<br>
recovery (EOR) technique improves the effectiveness of the standard EOR technique.<br>
Specifically, the combination of the unactivated polymeric microparticle with the standard EOR<br>
technique will have the effect, depending upon the treatment type, of decreasing or increasing the<br>
16<br>
half-life of the unactivated polymeric microparticle due to the effects of chemical and/or thermal<br>
action upon the microparticle. The activation of the polymeric microparticle will aid in blocking<br>
thief zones, thereby allowing for an observed improvement of a standard EOR treatment.<br>
[0081] In still yet another embodiment, compositions are provided that include at least<br>
two different highly cross linked expandable polymeric microparticles having unexpanded<br>
volume average particle size diameters of about 0.05 to about 50 microns and cross linking agent<br>
contents of about 1,000 to about 200,000 ppm of labile cross linkers and from 0 to about 300<br>
ppm of non-labile cross linkers, wherein the at least two different highly cross linked expandable<br>
polymeric microparticles have different cross linking agent contents.<br>
[0082] In an embodiment, the amount of labile cross linkers of a first polymeric<br>
microparticle may be greater than the amount of labile cross linkers of a second polymeric<br>
microparticle. Similarly, the amount of non-labile cross linkers of a first polymeric microparticle<br>
may also be greater than the amount of non-labile cross linkers of a second polymeric<br>
microparticle. The ability to vary the amount of cross linkers in a composition comprising at<br>
least two different polymeric microparticles allows the polymeric microparticles to expand at<br>
different rates, due to the effects of pH or temperature, for example, allowing the microparticles<br>
with higher levels of labile cross linker to flow to deeper areas of a subterranean formation.<br>
[0083] In an embodiment, a first polymeric microparticle comprises a polymeric<br>
backbone that is the same as a polymeric backbone of a second polymeric microparticle. As used<br>
herein, a polymeric backbone refers to the primary chain of repeat units that are derived from<br>
smaller molecules, called monomers, which react to bond together to form a long chain. The<br>
polymeric backbone may have ether molecules or atoms bonded at various locations along the<br>
primary chain.<br>
[0084] Accordingly, in another aspect of the present disclosure, methods of using the<br>
above-described compositions are provided. The methods are directed toward improving<br>
recovery of hydrocarbon fluids from a subterranean formation comprising injecting into the<br>
subterranean formation one or more of the compositions previously described herein, as well as<br>
variations or combinations thereof.<br>
[0085] For example, in an embodiment, a method for improving recovery of hydrocarbon<br>
fluids from a subterranean formation is provided. The method includes injecting into a<br>
subterranean formation at least two different cross linked polymeric microparticles having<br>
different chemical structures and having cross linking agent contents of from about 100 to about<br>
200,000 ppm of labile cross linkers and from 0 to about 300 ppm of non-labile cross linkers. The<br>
microparticles have a smaller diameter than the pores of the subterranean formation and the labile<br>
17<br>
cross linkers break under the conditions of temperature and pH in the subterranean formation to<br>
form expanded microparticles.<br>
[0086] The at least two different polymeric microparticles having different chemical<br>
structures may be injected separately into the subterranean formation. Alternatively, the at least<br>
two different polymeric microparticles may be mixed or blended prior to, during, or after<br>
injection. For example, the at least two different polymeric microparticles may be mixed prior to<br>
the injection into the subterranean formation. Alternatively, the at least two different polymeric<br>
microparticles may be mixed during the simultaneous injection into the subterranean formation.<br>
Further, the mixing may occur inside the subterranean formation. When mixing occurs inside the<br>
subterranean formation, the mixing may be effectuated by alternating injections of at least two<br>
different polymeric microparticles.<br>
[0087] In an embodiment, the at least two different highly cross linked expandable<br>
polymeric microparticles are added to injection water as part of a secondary or tertiary process<br>
for the recovery of hydrocarbon fluids from the subterranean formation. The injection water may<br>
be added to the subterranean formation at a temperature lower than the temperature of the<br>
subterranean formation. The injection water may also be added directly to a producing well.<br>
[0088] In an embodiment, the injection into the subterranean formation of the at least two<br>
different highly cross linked expandable polymeric microparticles is used in a carbon dioxide and<br>
water tertiary recovery project.<br>
[0089] In an embodiment, the injection into the subterranean formation of the at least two<br>
different highly cross linked expandable polymeric microparticles is used in a tertiary oil<br>
recovery process, one component of which constitutes water injection.<br>
[0090] In an embodiment, the subterranean formation is a sandstone or carbonate<br>
hydrocarbon reservoir.<br>
[0091] In another embodiment, a method for improving recovery of hydrocarbon fluids<br>
from a subterranean formation is provided. The method includes injecting into the subterranean<br>
formation both highly cross linked expandable polymeric microparticles having unexpanded<br>
volume average particle size diameters of about 0.05 to about 5,000 microns and cross linking<br>
agent contents of about 100 to about 200,000 ppm of labile cross linkers and from 0 to about 300<br>
ppm of non-labile cross linkers, and a viscosified aqueous solution. The microparticles have a<br>
smaller diameter than the pores of the subterranean formation and the labile cross linkers break<br>
under the conditions of temperature and pH in the subterranean formation to form expanded<br>
microparticles. In an embodiment, the viscosified aqueous solution includes additives selected<br>
18<br>
from the group consisting of water-soluble polymers, brines, surfactants, and combinations<br>
thereof.<br>
[0092] The highly cross linked expandable polymeric microparticles and the viscosified<br>
aqueous solution may be injected separately into the subterranean formation. Alternatively, the<br>
highly cross linked expandable polymeric microparticles and the viscosified aqueous solution<br>
may be mixed or blended prior to, during, or after injection. For example, the highly cross linked<br>
expandable polymeric microparticles and the viscosified aqueous solution may be mixed prior to<br>
the injection into the subterranean formation. Alternatively, the highly cross linked expandable<br>
polymeric microparticles and the viscosified aqueous solution may be mixed during the<br>
simultaneous injection into the subterranean formation. Further, the mixing may occur inside the<br>
subterranean formation. When mixing occurs inside the subterranean formation, the mixing may<br>
be effectuated by alternating injections of the highly cross linked expandable polymeric<br>
microparticles and the viscosified aqueous solution.<br>
[0093] In yet another embodiment, the present disclosure is directed to a method for<br>
improving recovery of hydrocarbon fluids from a subterranean formation. The method includes<br>
injecting into the subterranean formation both highly cross linked expandable polymeric<br>
microparticles having unexpanded volume average particle size diameters of about 0.05 to about<br>
5,000 microns and cross linking agent contents of about 100 to about 200,000 ppm of labile cross<br>
linkers and from 0 to about 300 ppm of non-labile cross linkers, and at least one subterranean<br>
reservoir treatment. The microparticles have a smaller diameter than the pores of the<br>
subterranean formation and the labile cross linkers break under the conditions of temperature and<br>
pH in the subterranean formation to form expanded microparticles.<br>
[0094] In an embodiment, the at least one subterranean reservoir treatment is an<br>
injectable fluid. The fluid may be any fluid known in the art and used in the recovery of<br>
hydrocarbon fluids from subterranean reservoirs. For example, the fluid may be selected from<br>
the group consisting of water, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen, polymer solutions, gels,<br>
surfactants, alkaline-enhanced chemicals, acids, bases, steam, foams, and combinations thereof.<br>
[0095] The expandable polymeric microparticles and the subterranean reservoir treatment<br>
may be injected separately into the subterranean formation. Alternatively, the expandable<br>
polymeric microparticles and the subterranean reservoir treatment may be mixed or blended prior<br>
to, during, or after injection. For example, the expandable polymeric microparticles and the<br>
subterranean reservoir treatment may be mixed prior to the injection into the subterranean<br>
formation. Alternatively, the expandable polymeric microparticles and the subterranean reservoir<br>
treatment may be mixed during the simultaneous injection into the subterranean formation.<br>
19<br>
Further, the mixing may occur inside the subterranean formation. When mixing occurs inside the<br>
subterranean formation, the mixing is effectuated by alternating injections of the expandable<br>
polymeric microparticles and the subterranean reservoir treatment.<br>
[0096] In an embodiment, the at least one subterranean reservoir treatment includes a<br>
fluid injection. The fluid may be any fluid known in the art and used in the recovery of<br>
hydrocarbon fluids from subterranean reservoirs. For example, the fluid may be selected from<br>
the group consisting of water, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen, polymer solutions, gels,<br>
surfactants, alkaline-enhanced chemicals, acids, bases, steam, foams, and combinations thereof.<br>
[0097] In still yet another embodiment, a method for improving recovery of hydrocarbon<br>
fluids from a subterranean formation is provided. The method includes injecting into a<br>
subterranean formation at least two different cross linked polymeric microparticles having cross<br>
linking agent contents of from about 100 to about 200,000 ppm of labile cross linkers and from 0<br>
to about 300 ppm of non-labile cross linkers, wherein the at least two different highly cross<br>
linked expandable polymeric microparticles have different cross linking agent contents. The<br>
microparticles have a smaller diameter than the pores of the subterranean formation and the labile<br>
cross linkers break under the conditions of temperature and pH in the subterranean formation to<br>
form expanded microparticles.<br>
[0098] The at least two different polymeric microparticles having different cross linking<br>
contents may be injected separately into the subterranean formation. Alternatively, the at least<br>
two different polymeric microparticles may be mixed or blended prior to, during, or after<br>
injection. For example, the at least two different polymeric microparticles may be mixed prior to<br>
the injection into the subterranean formation. Alternatively, the at least two different polymeric<br>
microparticles may be mixed during the simultaneous injection into the subterranean formation.<br>
Further, the mixing may occur inside the subterranean formation. When mixing occurs inside the<br>
subterranean formation, the mixing may be effectuated by alternating injections of at least two<br>
different polymeric microparticles.<br>
[0099] The foregoing may be better understood by reference to the following examples,<br>
which are presented for purposes of illustration and are not intended to limit the scope of the<br>
present disclosure.<br>
EXAMPLES 1-8<br>
[00100] Preparation of the Polymeric Microparticle<br>
[00101] The polymeric microparticle of this invention is readily prepared using<br>
inverse emulsion polymerization techniques as described below.<br>
20<br>
[00102] A representative emulsion polymer composition is prepared by<br>
polymerizing a monomer emulsion consisting of an aqueous mixture of 164.9 g of 50%<br>
acrylamide, 375.1 g of 58% sodium acrylamido methylpropane sulfonate (AMPS), 16.38 g water,<br>
0.5 g 40% pentasodium diethylenetriaminepentaacetate, 3.2 g of 1% solution of<br>
methylenebisacrylamide (mba), and 36.24 g polyethyleneglycol (PEG) diacrylate as the dispersed<br>
phase and a mixture of 336 g petroleum distillate, 60 g ethoxylated sorbitol oleate and 4 g<br>
sorbitan sesquioleate as the continuous phase.<br>
[00103] The monomer emulsion is prepared by mixing the aqueous phase and the<br>
oil phase, followed by homogenization using a Silverson Homogenizer. After deoxygenation<br>
with nitrogen for 30 minutes, polymerization is initiated by using sodium bisulfite/sodium<br>
bromate redox pair at room temperature. The temperature of the polymerization is not regulated.<br>
In general, the heat of polymerization will take the temperature from about 25 °C to about 80 °C<br>
in less than 5 minutes. After the temperature peaks, the reaction mixture is heated at about 75 °C<br>
for an additional 2 hours.<br>
[00104] If desired, the polymeric microparticle can be isolated from the latex by<br>
precipitating, filtering, and washing with a mixture of acetone and isopropanol. After drying, the<br>
oil and surfactant free particle can be redispersed in aqueous media. The average particle size of<br>
this latex particle measured in deionized water, using a Malvern Instruments' Mastersizer E, is<br>
0.28 micron.<br>

EXAMPLE 9<br>

[00106] Sand Pack Test<br>
[00107] This Example demonstrates that the polymeric microparticles of this<br>
invention can be propagated with a conformation constrained by the built-in reversible crosslinks<br>
and will expand in size when these break, to give a particle of suitable size to produce a<br>
substantial effect.<br>
[00108] In the sand pack test, a 40 foot long sand pack of 0.25 inches internal<br>
diameter, made from degreased and cleaned 316 stainless steel tubing, is constructed in eight<br>
sections, fitted with pressure transducers, flushed with carbon dioxide gas and then placed in an<br>
oven and flooded with synthetic oil field injection water.<br>
[00109] A dispersion of a representative polymeric microparticles is prepared in<br>
the synthetic injection water and injected into the pack to fill the pore volume. Pressure drops<br>
across the tube sections are monitored for signs of conformation change of the polymer particle<br>
as the reversible cross-links are hydrolysed. The "popping open" of the polymer particles is<br>
observed as a steep rise in the pressure drop. The sand pack test is described in detail in WO<br>
01/96707.<br>
[00110] The data for representative polymeric microparticles shows that the<br>
particles are able to travel through the first two sections of the sand pack without changing the<br>
RRF of the sections. However, particles in the last section, after accumulating a sufficient<br>
amount of residence time, have expanded and give a higher value of RRF. The higher RRF value<br>
is maintained after the injection fluid is changed from polymer dispersion to brine.<br>
[00111] This experiment clearly demonstrates two aspects of the invention which<br>
are:<br>
[00112] 1. The polymeric microparticles with a conformation constrained by<br>
the built-in reversible crosslinks can be propagated through a porous media.<br>
[00113] 2. The microparticles will expand in size when crosslinks break, to<br>
give a particle of suitable size to produce a substantial effect, even in a high permeability porous<br>
medium.<br>
EXAMPLE 10<br>
[00114] Activation of the Polymeric Microparticles by Heat<br>
[00115] As the particles expand in a medium of fixed volume, the volume fraction<br>
occupied by them increases. Consequently, the volume fraction of the continuous phase<br>
decreases. This decrease in free volume is reflected in an increase in the viscosity of the<br>
22<br>
dispersion. Activation of the microparticles of present disclosure by heat can be demonstrated in<br>
a bottle test.<br>
[00116] To carry out a bottle test, a dispersion containing 5000 ppm of the kernel<br>
particles is prepared in an aqueous medium (e.g., a synthetic brine). Dispersing of particles can<br>
be accomplished by vigorous stirring or by using a homogenizer. To prevent oxidative<br>
degradation of the expanding particles during monitoring, 1000 ppm sodium thiosulfate can be<br>
added to the mixture as an oxygen scavenger.<br>
[00117] The bottles were placed in a constant temperature oven to age. Then, at a<br>
predetermined time, a bottle can be removed from the oven and cooled to 75oF. The viscosity<br>
was measured at 75 °F using Brookfield LV No.l spindle at 60 rpm (shear rate 13.2 sec"1).<br>
[00118] Activation of the polymeric microparticles by heat can be demonstrated by<br>
monitoring the viscosity change of aqueous dispersions of particles aged at different temperature.<br>
[00119] It should be understood that various changes and modifications to the<br>
presently preferred embodiments described herein will be apparent to those skilled in the art.<br>
Such changes and modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the<br>
present subject matter and without diminishing its intended advantages. It is therefore intended<br>
that such changes and modifications be covered by the appended claims.<br>
