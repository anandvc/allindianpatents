				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of binder formulation useful for the preparation of agglomerated flavoured tea<br>
The tea plant belongs to the genius camellia [Camellia sinensis] cultivated in East Asian countries viz, China, Burma, India, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, etc Basically, two varieties of the tea plant are recognised viz, [1] The Chinese variety Smesis [2] The Assamese variety Assamica<br>
India is the largest producer of tea Total production of tea touched 800 million Kg in the year of 1999 and export was 253 million kg The black tea contains 5 - 8% moisture, 22 0 - 36 0% protein, 3 - 4% caffeine, 4 6-7 8% ash, 10 -25% tannins, 0 15-6 13 carbohydrates, 33 70 - 45 96% total soluble solids, 9 74 -17 65% crude fibre<br>
Tea is the most widely used ancient beverage in the world The concept of flavouring tea is an age-old tradition Tea is generally flavoured with natural and nature identical flavours, viz, Lemon, Mint, Bergamot, Rose, Ginger, etc Non-conventional teas viz, instant, decaffeinated and flavoured teas are in great demand Instant tea and decaffeinated tea are also being flavoured and sold in the market There is a steady increase in market for scented black tea, scented black decaffeinated teas, spiced teas, special decaffeinated, China jasmine tea and Earl grey tea (Bergamot) in U K , U S A , Middle Eastern countries and Japan<br>
This process involves the use of black tea dust, encapsulated Bergamot flavour and flavour emulsion as ingredients No other preservative or colour is used in this process The agglomerated flavoured tea obtained remains stable for 3 months at accelerated conditions of storage [40°C, 65% RH]<br>
From literature and patent search, it is seen that no process for the production of emulsion to prepare agglomerated flavoured tea has been reported<br>
The patent search has revealed that agglomeration techniques used in some of the food materials are given below<br>
Agglomeration tendency of gums like locust bean gum, carboxy methyl cellulose, sodium alginate and kappa carrageenan during top spray fluodized bed coating has been reported (ISSN 0023-6438 Lebens Mittil Wissenschaft - und - Technology, 31,6 (c), 576-584, 1998)<br>
Carbohydrate coatings (Pectin, gum ghatti, starch and resistant starch-C ) on absorption of lipid by potato chips during frying has been useful in producing chips with low lipid content (ISSN  04191-4217, Dissertation abstracts- international - B56,12 (C) 6485,1996 )<br>
Coating of fruits with a mixture of lecithin, methyl anthranilite is done to minimise oxidational deterioration and controls microorganisms (Canadian patent PN 890874 (C) J Fruits-vegetables and nuts, 1972 )<br>
Agglomeration techniques used in Alitame in chewing gums is reported (US 458989, Wngley jr II, Chicago USA 1991)<br>
The above mentioned references deal with coating techniques for fruits and vegetables using gum, carbohydrate, mixture of Lecithin and methyl anthralinite But no process is reported for production of emulsion formulation which is used in the preparation of agglomerated flavoured teas<br>
The tea leaves have different surface characterstics from that of fruits and vegetables Providing a flavour coating is highly difficult Hence an emulsion formulation<br>
is required for coating the flavour powder on the surface of tea which is already conditioned<br>
The main objective of the present invention is a process for the preparation of the binder formulations useful for preparation of agglomerated flavoured tea<br>
Accordingly a process for the preparation of binder formulations useful for the preparation of agglomerated flavoured tea, which comprises<br>
a)	homogenizing a mixture of 0 1% to 0 3% Gum arabica, 0 1 to 0 3% Lecthine and 0 5 to 1 5% volatile oil selected from bergamot, lemon and mint in water,<br>
b)	homogenizing mechanically at a speed of 1000 to 1500 rpm for a period of 2 to 5 minutes intermittently at a viscosity ranging between 1 4 to 16 mps at a temperature of 20 30°C and at a surface tension of 56 2-64 4 mN/m to obtain the said product<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the binder composition may be obtained form the following<br>
Gum Arabica	0 1-0 3%<br>
Lecithin	0 1-0 3%<br>
Volatile Oil	0 5-1 5%<br>
Balance is deminerahsed water<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the coating efficiency of the binder formulation may be effected with different concentration of binder are<br>
(Table Removed) Yet in another embodiment of the present invention, the coating efficiency of the binder formulation may be effected with different concentration of binders are<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
Flow   chart   for   the   production   of   emulsion   formulation   for agglomerated flavoured tea ( bergamot)<br>
(Flow chart  Removed) <br>
The novelty of the present invention comprises<br>
[1] Binder formulation consisting of Gum Arabica, Lecithin and volatile oil of<br>
bergamot/lemon/mint/any other specific to that flavour useful in the preparation of<br>
agglomerated flavoured tea [2] It is observed 54-56% of flavour powder is coated on tea dust with variation of Gum<br>
Arabica from 0 1 to 0 3% in emulsion formulation (Table-1) [3] It is observed 56% of flavour powder is coated on tea dust using minimum to 0 3%<br>
concentration of Lecithin in emulsion formulation (Table-1) [4] Coating efficiency is obtained maximum i e 56% using the emulsion formulation<br>
containing 0 1 to 0 2% of Gum Arabica and Lecithin   Coating efficiency is the<br>
uptake of material in the coated tea per unit weight of control tea Physico chemical<br>
characteristics of agglomarated flavoured tea are presented in Table 2<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustrations of this new invention<br>
Example 1 1L of emulsion formulation was prepared using 0 1g of Gum Arabica, 0 1g Lecithin weighed into a 100ml beaker to which 0 9gm of bergamot volatile oil and 10ml of water were added This was mixed well with glass rod for one minute Again 50ml of water was added and homogenized at 10,000 rpm for 2 minutes This was transferred into a 1L beaker Another 540ml water was added and homogenized for 2 minutes at the same speed This was collected into a bottle, viscosity was determined (14m Pas at 24°C ) Finally it was stoppered and sealed Thus prepared binder formulation (1L) was sufficient for production of 10kg of agglomerated flavoured tea<br>
Example 2<br>
1L of emulsion formulation was prepared using 0 15g of Gum Arabica, 0 15g Lecithin weighed into a 100ml beaker to which 0 9gm of lemon volatile oil and 10ml of water were added This was mixed well with glass rod for one minute Again 50ml of water was added and homogenized at 10,000 rpm for 2 m.nutes This was transffered into a 1L beaker Another 540ml water was added and homogenized for 2 minutes at the same speed This was collected into a bottle, viscosity was determined (15 m Pas at 24°C) Finally it was stoppered and sealed Thus prepared binder formulation ( 1L) was sufficient for production of 10kg of agglomerated flavoured tea<br>
Example 3<br>
A 714 g of tea dust was mixed with 143 ml of water in a rotating drum for 3 mm Material was removed and passed on to VFBD for drying and completed in single pass at 125°C/50°C of inlet and outlet temperature The dried pre - conditioned tea was mixed with 286 g of flavour powder in Sigma mixer for 1 mm Then the mixture passed through a newly fabricated ribbon mixer (20 kg/h capacity) with flow rate of 333 g/min by adjusting the feed rate Spray nozzle was fixed towards the end of the mixer, so that little mixing was given to the material before it falls into VFBD 280 ml of emulsion was sprayed through spray nozzle at the rate of 40 ml/mm on to the mixture, and further dried in VFBD for 15 mm in 3 passes Then the material was passed through granulator with 16 BS for 1 mm Final passing through 100 BS yielded agglomerated flavoured tea 83% (top) and uncoated flavour 13 0% (bottom) The ratio of tea dust, flavour powder and emulsion used is 2 55 1 02 1 00 respectively, covered by Indian Patent No 405/DEL/2001 dated 29/03/2001<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
