ABUSE RESISTANT AMPHETAMINE COMPOUNDS<br>
CROSS REFERENCE RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[001] This application claims benefit under 35 U.S.C. 119(e) to U.S. provisional<br>
application No. 60/473,929 filed May 29, 2003 and provisional application No.<br>
60/567,801 filed May 5, 2004, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference in<br>
their entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
(i) Field of the Invention<br>
[002] The invention relates to amphetamine compounds, compositions and<br>
methods of delivery and use comprising amphetamine covalently bound to a<br>
chemical moiety.<br>
[003] The invention relates to compounds comprised of amphetamine covalently<br>
bound to a chemical moiety in a manner that diminishes or eliminates<br>
pharmacological activity of amphetamine until released. The conjugates are stable<br>
in tests that simulate procedures likely to be used by illicit chemists in attempts to<br>
release amphetamine. The invention further provides for methods of therapeutic<br>
delivery of amphetamine compositions by oral administration. Additionally, release<br>
of amphetamine following oral administration occurs gradually over an extended<br>
period of time thereby eliminating spiking of drug levels. When taken at doses<br>
above the intended prescription, the bioavailability of amphetamine, including peak<br>
levels and total amount of drug absorbed, is substantially decreased. This decreases<br>
the potential for amphetamine abuse which often entails the use of extreme doses (1<br>
g or more a day). The compositions are also resistant to abuse by parenteral routes<br>
of administration, such as intravenous "shooting", intranasal "snorting", or<br>
inhalation "smoking", that are often employed in illicit use. The invention thus<br>
provides a stimulant based treatment for certain disorders, such as attention deficit<br>
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which is commonly treated with amphetamine.<br>
Treatment of ADHD with compositions of the invention results in substantially<br>
decreased abuse liability as compared to existing stimulant treatments.<br><br>
WO 2005/000334	PCT/US2004/017204<br>
2<br>
(ii) Background of the Invention<br>
[004] The invention is directed to amphetamine conjugate compounds,<br>
compositions, and methods of manufacture and use thereof. In particular, the<br>
invention is directed to an anti-abuse/sustained release formulation which maintains<br>
its therapeutic effectiveness when administered orally. The invention further relates<br>
to formulations which diminish or reduce the euphoric effect while maintaining<br>
therapeutically effective blood concentrations following oral administration.<br>
[005] Amphetamine is prescribed for the treatment of various disorders, including<br>
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obesity and narcolepsy.<br>
Amphetamine and methamphetamine stimulate the central nervous system and have<br>
been used medicinally to treat ADHD, narcolepsy and obesity. Because of its<br>
stimulating effects amphetamine and its derivatives (e.g., amphetamine analogues)<br>
are often abused. Similarly, p-methoxyamphetamine, methylenedioxyamphetaminc,<br>
2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine, 2,4,5-trimethoxyamphetamine and 3,4-<br>
methylenedioxymethamphetamine are also often abused.<br>
[006] In children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), potent CNS<br>
stimulants have been used for several decades as a drug treatment given either alone<br>
or as an adjunct to behavioral therapy. While methylphenidate (Ritalin) has been the<br>
most frequently prescribed stimulant, the prototype of the class, amphetamine<br>
(alpha-methyl phenethvlamine) has been used all along and increasingly so in recent<br>
years. (Bradley C, Bowen M, "Amphetamine (Benzedrine) therapy of children's<br>
behavior disorders." American Journal of Orthopsvchiatry 11: 92) (1941).<br>
[007] The potential for abuse of amphetamines is a major drawback to its use. The<br>
high abuse potential has earned it Schedule II status according to the Controlled<br>
Substances Act (CSA). Schedule II classification is reserved for those drugs that<br>
have accepted medical use but have the highest potential for abuse. The abuse<br>
potential of amphetamine has been known for many years and the FDA requires the<br>
following black box warning in the package inserts of products:<br><br>
WO 2005/000334	PCT/US2004/017204<br>
3<br>
AMPHETAMINES HAVE A HIGH POTENTIAL FOR ABUSE. ADMINISTRATION OF<br>
AMPHETAMINES FOR PROLONGED PERIODS OF TIME MAY LEAD TO DRUG<br>
DEPENDENCE AND MUST BE AVOIDED. PARTICULAR ATTENTION SHOULD BE PAID<br>
TO THE POSSIBILITY OF SUBJECTS OBTAINING AMPHETAMINES FOR<br>
NONTHERAPEUTIC USE OR DISTRIBUTION TO OTHERS, AND THE DRUGS SHOULD BE<br>
PRESCRIBED OR DISPENSED SPARINGLY.	<br>
[008] Furthermore, recent developments in the abuse of prescription drug products<br>
increasingly raise concerns about the abuse of amphetamine prescribed for ADHD.<br>
Similar to OxyContin, a sustained release formulation of a potent narcotic analgesic,<br>
Adderall XRÂ® represents a product with increased abuse liability relative to the<br>
single dose tablets. The source of this relates to the higher concentration of<br>
amphetamine in each tablet and the potential for release of the full amount of active<br>
pharmaceutical ingredient upon crushing. Therefore, like OxyContin, it may be<br>
possible for substance abusers to obtain a high dose of the pharmaceutical with rapid<br>
onset by snorting the powder or dissolving it in water and injecting it. (Cone, E. J.,<br>
R. V. Fant, et al., "Oxycodone involvement in drug abuse deaths: a DAWN-based<br>
classification scheme applied to an oxycodone postmortem database containing over<br>
1000 cases." J Anal Toxicol 27(2); 57-67; discussion 67) (2003).<br>
[009] It has been noted recently that "53 percent of children not taking medication<br>
for ADHD knew of students with the disorder either giving away or selling their<br>
medications. And 34 percent of those being treated for the disorder acknowledged<br>
they had been approached to sell or trade them." (Dartmouth-Hitchcock, 2003)<br>
"Understanding ADHD Stimulant Abuse." http://12.42.224.168/healthyliving/<br>
familyhome/jan03familyhomestimulantabuse.htm). In addition, it was reported that<br>
students at one prep school obtained Dexedrine and Adderall to either swallow<br>
tablets whole or crush and sniff them. (Dartmouth-Hitchcock (2003).<br>
[010] According to the drug enforcement administration (DEA, 2003):<br>
Methylphenidate and amphetamine can be abused orally or the tablets can be<br>
crushed and snorted or dissolved in water and injected. The pattern of abuse<br>
is characterized by escalation in dose, frequent episodes of binge use<br>
followed by severe depression and an overpowering desire to continue the<br>
use of these drugs despite serious adverse medical and social consequences.<br><br>
WO 2005/000334	PCT/US2004/017204<br>
4<br>
Rendering this potent stimulant resistant to abuse, particularly by parenteral<br>
routes such as snorting or injecting, would provide considerable value to this<br>
otherwise effective and beneficial prescription medication.<br>
(DEA (2003). "Stimulant Abuse By School Age Children: A Guide for<br>
School<br>
Officials."http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/pubs/brochures/stimulant/stim<br>
ulant_abuse.htm).<br>
[011] Typically, sustained release formulations contain drug particles mixed with<br>
or covered by a polymer material, or blend of materials, which are resistant to<br>
degradation or disintegration in the stomach and/or in the intestine for a selected<br>
period of time. Release of the drug may occur by leeching, erosion, rupture,<br>
diffusion or similar actions depending upon the nature of the polymer material or<br>
polymer blend used. Additionally, these formulations are subject to breakdown<br>
following relatively simple protocols which allows for abuse of the active<br>
ingredient.<br>
[012] Conventionally, pharmaceutical manufacturers have used hydrophilic<br>
hydrocolloid gelling polymers such as hydroxypropyl methylcellulose,<br>
hydroxypropyl cellulose or Pullulan to formulate sustained release tablets or<br>
capsules. These polymers first form a gel when exposed to an aqueous environment<br>
of low pH thereby slowly diffusing the active medicament which is contained within<br>
the polymer matrix. When the gel enters a higher pH environment such as that<br>
found in the intestines, however, it dissolves resulting in a less controlled drug<br>
release. To provide better sustained release properties in higher pH environments,<br>
some pharmaceutical manufacturers use polymers which dissolve only at higher<br>
pHs, such as acrylic resins, acrylic latex dispersions, cellulose acetate phthalate, and<br>
hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate, either alone or in combination with<br>
hydrophilic polymers.<br>
[013] These formulations are prepared by combining the medicament with a finely<br>
divided powder of the hydrophilic polymer, or the hydrophilic and water-insoluble<br>
polymers. These ingredients are mixed and granulated with water or an organic<br>
solvent and the granulation is dried. The dry granulation is then usually further<br>
blended with various pharmaceutical additives and compressed into tablets.<br><br>
WO 2005/000334	PCT/US2004/017204<br>
5<br>
[014] Although these types of formulations have been successfully used to<br>
manufacture dosage forms which demonstrate sustained release properties, these<br>
formulations are subject to several shortcomings including uneven release and are<br>
subject to abuse.<br>
[015] The need exists for an abuse resistant dosage form of amphetamine which is<br>
therapeutically effective. Further the need exists for an amphetamine dosage form<br>
which provides sustained release and sustained therapeutic effect.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
[016] The invention provides covalent attachment of amphetamine and derivatives<br>
or analogs thereof to a variety of chemical moieties. The chemical moieties may<br>
include any substance which results in a prodrug form, i.e., a molecule which is<br>
converted into its active form in the body by normal metabolic processes. The<br>
chemical moieties may be for instance, amino acids, peptides, glycopeptides,<br>
carbohydrates, nucleosides, or vitamins.<br>
[017] The chemical moiety is covalently attached either directly or indirectly<br>
through a linker to the amphetamine. The site of attachment is typically determined<br>
by the functional group(s) available on the amphetamine.<br>
[018] In one embodiment of the invention, the chemical moiety is a carrier peptide<br>
as defined herein. The carrier peptide may be attached to amphetamine through the<br>
carrier's N-terminus, C-terminus or side chain of an amino acid which may be either<br>
a single amino acid or part of a longer chain sequence (i.e. a dipeptide, tripeptide, an<br>
oligopcptide or a polypeptide). Preferably, the carrier peptide is (i) an amino acid,<br>
(ii) a dipeptide, (iii) a tripeptide, (iv) an oligopeptide, or (v) polypeptide. The carrier<br>
peptide may also be (i) a homopolymer of a naturally occurring amino acid, (ii) a<br>
heteropolymer of two or more naturally occurring amino acids, (iii) a homopolymer<br>
of a synthetic amino acid, (iv) a heteropolymer of two or more synthetic amino<br>
acids, or (v) a heteropolymer of one or more naturally occurring amino acids and<br>
one or more synthetic amino acids, A further embodiment of the carrier and/or<br>
conjugate is that the unattached portion of the carrier/conjugate may be in a free and<br><br>
WO 2005/000334	PCT/US2004/017204<br>
6<br>
unprotected state. Preferably, synthetic amino acids with alkyl side chains are<br>
selected from alkyls of C1-C17 in length and more preferably from C1-C6 in length.<br>
[019] Covalent attachment of a chemical moiety to amphetamine can decrease its<br>
pharmacological activity when administered through injection or intranasally.<br>
Compositions of the invention, however, provide amphetamine covalently attached<br>
to a chemical moiety which remains orally bioavailable. The bioavailability is a<br>
result of the hydrolysis of the covalent linkage following oral administration.<br>
Hydrolysis is time-dependent, thereby allowing amphetamine to become available in<br>
its active form over an extended period of time. In one embodiment, the<br>
composition provides oral bioavailability which resembles the pharmacokinetics<br>
observed for extended release formulations. In another embodiment, release of<br>
amphetamine is diminished or eliminated when delivered by parenteral routes.<br>
[020] In one embodiment, the compositions maintain their effectiveness and abuse<br>
resistance following the crushing of the tablet, capsule or other oral dosage form. In<br>
contrast, conventional extended release formulations used to control the release of<br>
amphetamine through incorporation into matrices are subject to release of up to the<br>
entire amphetamine content immediately following crushing. When the content of<br>
the crushed tablet is injected or snorted, the large dose of amphetamine produces the<br>
"rush" effect sought by addicts.<br>
[021] In one embodiment, the amphetamine is attached to a single amino acid<br>
which is either naturally occurring or a synthetic amino acid. In another<br>
embodiment, the amphetamine is attached to a dipeptide or tripeptide, which could<br>
be any combination of the naturally occurring amino acids and synthetic amino<br>
acids. In another embodiment, the amino acids are selected from L-amino acids for<br>
digestion by proteases.<br>
[022] In another embodiment, the side chain attachment of amphetamine to the<br>
polypeptide or amino acid are selected from homopolymers or heteropolymers of<br>
glutamic acid, aspartic acid, serine, lysine, cysteine, threonine, asparagine, arginine,<br>
tyrosine, and glutamine. Examples of peptides include, Lys, Ser, Phe, Gly-Gly-Gly,<br>
Leu-Ser, Leu-Glu, homopolymers of Glu and Leu, and heteropolymers of (Glu)n-<br><br>
WO 2005/000334	PCT/US2004/017204<br>
7<br>
Leu-Ser. In a preferred embodiment, the composition is selected from Lys-Amp,<br>
Ser-Amp, Phe-Amp, and Gly-Gly-GIy-Amp.<br>
[023] In another embodiment, the invention provides a carrier and amphetamine<br>
which are bound to each other but otherwise unmodified in structure. This<br>
embodiment may further be described as the carrier having a free carboxy and/or<br>
amine terminal and/or side chain groups other than at the location of attachment for<br>
the amphetamine. In a preferred embodiment, the carrier, whether a single amino<br>
acid, dipeptide, tripeptide, oligopeptide or polypeptide, comprises only naturally<br>
occurring amino acids.<br>
[024] Another embodiment of the invention provides a method for delivering<br>
amphetamine dosage which prevents euphoria, comprising administering to a patient<br>
in need a composition formulated for oral dosage comprising amphetamine<br>
covalently attached to a chemical moiety wherein said blood levels of amphetamine<br>
maintain a therapeutically effect level but do not result in a euphoric effect.<br>
[025] In another embodiment, the covalent attachment of a chemical moiety<br>
substantially decreases the potential for overdose by decreasing the toxicity of<br>
amphetamine at doses above those considered therapeutic, while maintaining its<br>
pharmaceutical activity within a normal dose range. Covalent attachment of the<br>
chemical moiety may decrease or eliminate the pharmacological activity of<br>
amphetamine. Therefore, restoring activity requires release of the amphetamine<br>
from the chemical moiety. At higher doses partial or complete saturation of<br>
processes responsible for amphetamine release may be reached thus diminishing or<br>
eliminating the release of harmful levels of active amphetamine. For example,<br>
aspects of pharmacological activity, release, saturation are further depicted in figures<br>
1-55.<br>
[026] In another embodiment of the invention, the covalent attachment of a<br>
chemical moiety substantially decreases the potential for overdose by decreasing the<br>
rate or overall amount of absorption of the amphetamine when given at doses above<br>
those considered therapeutic.<br><br>
WO 2005/000334	PCT/US2004/017204<br>
8<br>
[027] In another embodiment of the invention, the covalent attachment of a<br>
chemical moiety substantially decreases the potential for overdose by increasing the<br>
rate or overall amount of clearance of amphetamine when given at doses above those<br>
considered therapeutic.<br>
[028] Another embodiment provides a method of treating a patient suffering from<br>
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, narcolepsy or obesity comprising providing,<br>
administering, prescribing, etc. compositions of the invention.<br>
[029] Another embodiment of the invention provides a method for delivering<br>
amphetamine, comprising providing a patient with a therapeutically effective<br>
amount of amphetamine covalently attached to a chemical moiety which provides a<br>
therapeutically bioequivalent AUC when compared to amphetamine alone but does<br>
not provide a Cmax which results in euphoria when taken orally.<br>
[030] Other objects, advantages and embodiments of the invention are described<br>
below and will be obvious from this description and practice of the invention.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[086] In accordance with the present invention and as used herein, the following<br>
terms are defined with the following meanings, unless explicitly stated otherwise.<br>
For additional methods of attaching amphetamine to carriers, see application number<br>
U.S. 10/156,527, and/or PCT/US03/05524 and/or PCT/US03/05525 each of which<br>
is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
[087] The invention utilizes covalent modification of amphetamine to decrease its<br>
potential for causing overdose or abuse. The amphetamine is covalently modified in<br>
a manner that decreases its pharmacological activity, as compared to the unmodified<br>
amphetamine, at doses above those considered therapeutic. When given at lower<br>
doses, such as those intended for therapy, the covalently modified amphetamine<br>
retains pharmacological activity similar to that of the unmodified amphetamine. The<br>
covalent modification of amphetamine may comprise the attachment of any<br>
chemical moiety through conventional chemistry.<br>
[088] Compounds, compositions and methods of the invention provide reduced<br>
potential for overdose, reduced potential for abuse or addiction, and/or improve<br>
amphetamine's characteristics with regard to high toxicities or suboptimal release<br>
profiles. Without wishing to be limited to the below theory, we believe that<br>
overdose protection results from a natural gating mechanism at the site of hydrolysis<br>
that limits the release of the active amphetamine from the prodrug at greater than<br>
therapeutically prescribed amounts. Therefore, abuse resistance is provided by<br>
limiting the "rush" or "high" available from the active amphetamine released by the<br>
prodrug and limiting the effectiveness of alternative routes of administration.<br>
Further, it is believed that the prodrug itself does not cross the blood brain barrier<br>
and is thus substantially absent from the central nervous system.<br>
[089] Throughout this application the use of "peptide" is meant to include a single<br>
amino acid, a dipeptide, a tripeptide, an oligopeptide, a polypeptide, or the carrier<br>
peptide. Oligopeptide is meant to include from 2 amino acids to 70 amino acids.<br><br>
WO 2005/000334	PCT/US2004/017204<br>
15<br>
Further, at times the invention is described as being an active agent attached to an<br>
amino acid, a dipeptide, a tripeptide, an oligopeptide, polypeptide or carrier peptide<br>
to illustrate specific embodiments for the active agent conjugate. Preferred lengths<br>
of the conjugates and other preferred embodiments are described herein.<br>
[090] Throughout this application the use of "chemical moiety" is meant to include<br>
at least amino acid(s), peptide(s), glycopeptide(s), carbohydrate(s), lipid(s),<br>
nucleoside(s), or vitamin(s).<br>
[091] Carbohydrates include sugars, starches, cellulose, and related compounds.<br>
e.g., (CH2O)n, wherein n is an integer larger than 2 or Cn(H2O)n_1, with n larger than<br>
5. More specific examples include, for instance, fructose, glucose, lactose, maltose,<br>
sucrose, glyceraldehyde, dihydroxyacetone, erythrose, ribose, ribulose, xylulose,<br>
galactose, mannose, sedoheptulose, neuraminic acid, dextrin, and glycogen.<br>
[092] A glycoprotein is a carbohydrate (or glycan) covalently linked to protein.<br>
The carbohydrate may be in the form of a monosaccharide, disaccharide(s),<br>
oligosaccharide(s), polysaccharide(s), or their derivatives (e.g. sulfo- or phospho-<br>
substituted).<br>
[093] A glycopeptide is a carbohydrate linked to an oligopeptide composed of L-<br>
and/or D-amino acids. A glyco-amino-acid is a saccharide attached to a single<br>
amino acid by any kind of covalent bond. A glycosyl-amino- acid is a compound<br>
consisting of saccharide linked through a glycosyl linkage (O-, N- or S-) to an amino<br>
acid.<br>
[094] A "composition" as used herein refers broadly to any composition containing<br>
a described molecule conjugate(s). The composition may comprise a dry<br>
formulation, an aqueous solution, or a sterile composition. Compositions<br>
comprising the molecules described herein may be stored in freeze-dried form and<br>
may be associated with a stabilizing agent such as a carbohydrate. In use, the<br>
composition may be deployed in an aqueous solution containing salts, e.g., NaCl,<br>
detergents, e.g., sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and other components.<br>
[095] "Amphetamine" shall mean any of the sympatho mimetic phenethylamine<br>
derivatives which have central nervous system stimulant activity, such as but not<br><br>
WO 2005/000334	PCT/US2004/017204<br>
16<br>
limited to, amphetamine, methamphetamine, p-methoxyamphetamine,<br>
methylenedioxyamphetamine, 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine, 2,4,5-<br>
trimethoxyamphetamine and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine.<br><br>
Amphetamine	Methylphenidate<br>
[100] Other embodiments are described according to the following abbreviations.<br>
Lys-Amp = L-lysine-d-amphetamine, Lys-Amph, Lysine-Amphetamine,<br>
KAMP, K-amphetamine, or 2,6-diaminohexanoic acid-(l-methyl-2-<br>
phenylethyl)-amide<br>
Phe-Amp = Phenylalanine-Amphetamine, FAMP, or<br>
2-amino-3-phenylpropanoicacid-(l-methyl-2-phenylethyl)-amide,<br>
Ser-Amp = Serine-Amphetamine, SAMP, or<br>
2-amino-3-hydroxylpropanoic acid-(l-methyl-2-phenylethyI)-amide,<br>
Gly3-Amp = GGG-Amphetamine, GGGAMP, or<br>
2-Amino-N-({ [(1 -methyl-2-phenyl-ethylcarbomyl)-rnethyl]-carbornyl} -<br>

[101] This patent is meant to cover all compounds discussed regardless of absolute<br>
configurations. Thus, natural, L-amino acids are discussed but the use of D-amino<br>
acids are also included. Similarly, references to amphetamine should be interpreted<br>
as inclusive of dextro- and levo-isomers.<br>
[102] Furthermore, the following abbreviations may be used throughout the patent.<br>
BOC = t-butyloxycarbonyl<br>
CMC = carboxymethylcellulose<br>
DIPEA = di-isopropyl ethyl amine<br>
mp = melting point<br>
NMR = nuclear magnetic resonance<br>
OSu = hydroxysuccinimido ester<br><br>

[103] "In a manner inconsistent with the manufacturer's instructions" is meant to<br>
include but is not limited to consuming amounts greater than amounts described on<br>
the label or ordered by a licensed physician, and/or altering by any means (e.g.<br>
crushing, breaking, melting, separating etc.) the dosage formulation such that the<br>
composition maybe injected, inhaled or smoked.<br>
[104] Use of the phrases such as "decreased", "reduced", "diminished" or<br>
"lowered" is meant to include at least a 10% change in pharmacological activity<br>
with greater percentage changes being preferred for reduction in abuse potential and<br>
overdose potential. For instance, the change may also be greater than 25%, 35%,<br>
45%, 55%, 65%, 75%, 85%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or increments therein.<br>
[105] For each of the recited embodiments, the amphetamine may be any of the<br>
above discussed stimulants. In one embodiment, the amphetamine is<br>
dextroamphetamine or methylphenidate.<br>
[106] The attached chemical moiety may be any chemical substance that decreases<br>
the pharmacological activity until amphetamine is released. Preferably the chemical<br>
moiety is a single amino acid, dipeptide or tripeptide. Amphetamine binds to<br>
specific sites to produce various effects (Hoebel, et al, 1989). The attachment of<br>
certain chemical moieties can therefore diminish or prevent binding to these<br>
biological target sites. Further, the covalent modification may prevent stimulant<br>
activity by preventing the drug from crossing the blood-brain barrier. Preferably,<br>
absorption of the composition into the brain is prevented or substantially diminished<br>
and/or delayed when delivered by routes other than oral administration.<br>
[107] The attached chemical moiety may further comprise naturally occurring or<br>
synthetic substances. This includes, but is not limited to, the attachment of<br>
amphetamine to amino acids, peptides, lipids, carbohydrates, glycopeptides, nucleic<br>
acids or vitamins. These chemical moieties could be expected to affect delayed<br>
release in the gastrointestinal tract and prevent rapid onset of the desired activity,<br>
particularly when delivered by parenteral routes. (Hoebel, B. G., L. Hernandez, et<br>
al., "Microdialysis studies of brain norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine release<br><br>

during ingestive behavior. Theoretical and clinical implications." Ann N Y Acad Sci<br>
575: 171-91) (1989).<br>
[108] For each of the recited embodiments, the amino acid or peptide may<br>
comprise of one or more of the naturally occurring (L-) amino acids: alanine,<br>
arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glycine, glutamic acid, glutamine,<br>
histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, proline, phenylalanine, serine,<br>
tryptophan, threonine, tyrosine, and valine. In another embodiment, the amino acid<br>
or peptide is comprised of one or more of the naturally occurring (D) amino acids:<br>
alanine, arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glycine, glutamic acid,<br>
glutamine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, proline, phenylalanine,<br>
serine, tryptophan, threonine, tyrosine, and valine. In another embodiment, the<br>
amino acid or peptide is comprised of one or more unnatural, non-standard or<br>
synthetic amino acids such as, aminohexanoic acid, biphenylalanine,<br>
cyclohexylalanine, cyclohexyl glycine, diethylglycine, dipropylglycine, 2,3-<br>
diaminoproprionic acid, homophenylalanine, homoserine, homotyrosine,<br>
naphthylalanine,	norleucine,	ornithine,	pheylalanine(4-fluoro),<br>
phenylalanine(2,3,4,5,6 pentafluoro), phenylalanine(4-nitro), phenylglycine,<br>
pipecolic acid, sarcosine, tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid, and tert-leucine.<br>
In another embodiment, the amino acid or peptide comprises of one or more amino<br>
acid alcohols, for example, serine and threonine. In another embodiment the amino<br>
acid or peptide comprises of one or more N-methyl amino acids, for example, N-<br>
methyl aspartic acid.<br>
[109] In another embodiment, the specific carriers are utilized as a base short chain<br>
amino acid sequence and additional amino acids are added to the terminus or side<br>
chain. In another embodiment, the above amino acid sequence may have one more<br>
of the amino acids substituted with one of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids. It<br>
is preferred that the substitution be with an amino acid which is similar in structure<br>
or charge compared to the amino acid in the sequence. For instance, isoleucine<br>
(IIe)[I] is structurally very similar to leucine (Leu)[L], whereas, tyrosine (Tyr)[Y] is<br>
similar to phenylalanine (Phe)[F], whereas serine (Ser)[S] is similar to threonine<br>
(Thr)[T], whereas cysteine (Cys)[C] is similar to methionine (Met)[M], whereas<br><br>
WO 2005/000334	PCT/US2004/017204<br>
19<br>
atanine (Ala)[A] is similar to valine (Val)[V], whereas lysine (Lys)[K] is similar to<br>
arginine (Arg)[R], whereas asparagine (Asn)[N] is similar to glutamine (Gln)[Q],<br>
whereas aspartic acid (Asp)[D] is similar to glutamic acid (Glu)[E], whereas<br>
histidine (His)[H] is similar to proline (Pro)[P], and glycine (Gly)[G] is similar to<br>
tryptophan (Trp)[W]. In the alternative, the preferred amino acid substitutions may<br>
be selected according to hydrophilic properties (i.e., polarity) or other common<br>
characteristics associated with the 20 essential amino acids. While preferred<br>
embodiments utilize the 20 natural amino acids for their GRAS characteristics, it is<br>
recognized that minor substitutions along the amino acid chain which do not effect<br>
the essential characteristics of the amino acid chain are also contemplated.<br>
[110] In one embodiment, the carrier range is between one to 12 chemical moieties<br>
with one to 8 moieties being preferred. In another embodiment, the number of<br>
chemical moieties is selected from 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7. In another embodiment, the<br>
molecular weight of the carrier portion of the conjugate is below about 2,500, more<br>
preferably below about 1,000, and most preferably below about 500 kD. In one<br>
embodiment, the chemical moiety is a single lysine. In another embodiment, the<br>
chemical moiety is a lysine bound to an additional chemical moiety.<br>
[1ll] Another embodiment of the invention is a composition for preventing<br>
overdose comprising amphetamine which has been covalently bound to a chemical<br>
moiety.<br>
[112] Another embodiment of the invention is a composition for safely delivering<br>
amphetamine comprising a therapeutically effective amount of said amphetamine<br>
which has been covalently bound to a chemical moiety wherein said chemical<br>
moiety reduces the rate of absorption of the amphetamine as compared to delivering<br>
the unbound amphetamine.<br>
[113] Another embodiment of the invention is a composition for reducing<br>
amphetamine toxicity comprising amphetamine which has been covalently bound to<br>
a chemical moiety wherein said chemical moiety increases the rate of clearance<br>
when given at doses exceeding those within the therapeutic range of said<br>
amphetamine.<br><br>
WO 2005/000334	PCT/US2004/017204<br>
20<br>
[114] Another embodiment of the invention is a composition for reducing<br>
amphetamine toxicity comprising amphetamine which has been covalently bound to<br>
a chemical moiety wherein said chemical moiety provides a serum release curve<br>
which does not increase above amphetamine's toxicity level when given at doses<br>
exceeding those within the therapeutic range of amphetamine.<br>
[115] Another embodiment of the invention is a composition for reducing<br>
bioavailability of amphetamine comprising amphetamine covalently bound to a<br>
chemical moiety wherein said bound amphetamine maintains a steady-state serum<br>
release curve which provides a therapeutically effective bioavailability but prevents<br>
spiking or increased blood serum concentrations compared to unbound amphetamine<br>
when given at doses exceeding those within the therapeutic range of amphetamine.<br>
[116] Another embodiment of the invention is a composition for preventing a Cmax<br>
spike for amphetamine when taken by mean other than orally while still providing a<br>
therapeutically effective bioavailability curve if taken orally comprising an<br>
amphetamine which has been covalently bound to a chemical moiety.<br>
[117] Another embodiment of the invention is a composition for preventing a toxic<br>
release profile in a patient comprising amphetamine covalently bound to a chemical<br>
moiety wherein said bound amphetamine maintains a steady-state serum release<br>
curve which provides a therapeutically effective bioavailability but prevents spiking<br>
or increase blood serum concentrations compared to unbound amphetamine.<br>
[118] Another embodiment of the invention is a compound of Formula I:<br>
A-Xn-Zm<br>
wherein A is an amphetamine as defined herein; X is a chemical moiety as defined<br>
herein and n is between 1 and 50 and increments thereof; and Z is a further chemical<br>
moiety different from X which acts as an adjuvant and m is between 1 and 50 and<br>
increments thereof. In another embodiment, n is between 1 and 50, more preferably<br>
between 1 and 10, and m is 0.<br>
[119] Embodiments of the invention provide amphetamine compositions which<br>
allow the amphetamine to be therapeutically effective when delivered at the proper<br><br>
WO 2005/000334	PCT/US2004/017204<br>
21<br>
dosage but reduces the rate of absorption or extent of bioavailability of the<br>
amphetamine when given at doses exceeding those within the therapeutic range of<br>
amphetamine. Embodiments of the invention also provide amphetamine<br>
compositions wherein the covalently bound chemical moiety increases the rate of<br>
clearance of amphetamine when given at doses exceeding those within the<br>
therapeutic range of the amphetamine.<br>
[120] In another embodiment, the amphetamine compositions have substantially<br>
lower toxicity compared to unbound amphetamine. In another embodiment, the<br>
amphetamine compositions reduce or eliminate the possibility of overdose by oral<br>
administration. In another embodiment, the amphetamine compositions reduce or<br>
eliminate the possibility of overdose by intranasal administration. In another<br>
embodiment, the amphetamine compositions reduce or eliminate the possibility of<br>
overdose by injection. In another embodiment, the amphetamine compositions<br>
reduce or eliminate the possibility of overdose by inhalation.<br>
[121] In another embodiment, the amphetamine conjugates of the invention may<br>
further comprise a polymer blend which comprises a hydrophilic polymer and/or a<br>
water-insoluble polymer. The polymers may be used according to industry<br>
standards to further enhance the sustained release/abuse resistant properties of the<br>
amphetamine conjugate without reducing the abuse resistance. For instance, a<br>
composition might include: about 70% to about 100% amphetamine conjugate by<br>
weight, from about 0.01% to about 10% of a hydrophilic polymer (e.g.<br>
hydroxypropyl methylcellulose), from about 0.01% to about 2.5% of a water-<br>
insoluble polymer (e.g. acrylic resin), from about 0,01% to about 1.5% of additives<br>
(e.g. magnesium stearate), and from about 0.01% to about 1% colorant by weight.<br>
[122] Hydrophilic polymers suitable for use in the sustained release formulations<br>
include one or more natural or partially or totally synthetic hydrophilic gums such as<br>
acacia, gum tragacanth, locust bean gum, guar gum, or karaya gum, modified<br>
cellulosic substances such as methylcellulose, hydroxomethylcellulose,<br>
hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose,<br>
carboxymethylcellulose; proteinaceous substances such as agar, pectin, carrageen,<br><br>
WO 2005/000334	PCT/US2004/017204<br>
22<br>
and alginates; and other hydrophilic polymers such as carboxypolymethylene,<br>
gelatin, casein, zein, bentonite, magnesium aluminum silicate, polysaccharides,<br>
modified starch derivatives, and other hydrophilic polymers known to those of skill<br>
in the art, or a combination of such polymers. These hydrophilic polymers gel and<br>
would dissolve slowly in aqueous acidic media thereby allowing the amphetamine<br>
conjugate to diffuse from the gel in the stomach. When the gel reaches the intestines<br>
it would dissolve in controlled quantities in the higher pH medium to allow further<br>
sustained release. Preferred hydrophilic polymers are the hydroxypropyl<br>
methylcelluloses such as those manufactured by The Dow Chemical Company and<br>
known as Methocel ethers, such as Methocel E10M.<br>
[123] Other formulations may further comprise pharmaceutical additives including,<br>
but not limited to: lubricants such as magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, zinc<br>
stearate, powdered stearic acid, hydrogenated vegetable oils, talc, polyethylene<br>
glycol, and mineral oil; colorants such as Emerald Green Lake, FD&amp;C Red No. 40,<br>
FD&amp;C Yellow No. 6, D&amp;C Yellow No. 10, or FD&amp;C Blue No. 1 and other various<br>
certified color additives (See 21 CFR, Part 74); binders such as sucrose, lactose,<br>
gelatin, starch paste, acacia, tragacanth, povidone polyethylene glycol, Pullulan and<br>
corn syrup; glidants such as colloidal silicon dioxide and talc; surface active agents<br>
such as sodium lauryl sulfate, dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate, triethanolamine,<br>
polyoxyethylene sorbitan, poloxalkol, and quarternary ammonium salts;<br>
preservatives and stabilizers; excipients such as lactose, mannitol, glucose, fructose,<br>
xylose, galactose, sucrose, maltose, xylitol, sorbitol, chloride, sulfate and phosphate<br>
salts of potassium, sodium, and magnesium; and/or any other pharmaceutical<br>
additives known to those of skill in the art. In one preferred embodiment, a<br>
sustained release formulation further comprises magnesium stearate and Emerald<br>
Green Lake.<br>
[124] An amphetamine conjugate, which is further formulated with excipients, may<br>
be manufactured according to any appropriate method known to those of skill in the<br>
art of pharmaceutical manufacture. For instance, the amphetamine-conjugate and a<br>
hydrophilic polymer may be mixed in a mixer with an aliquot of water to form a wet<br>
granulation. The granulation may be dried to obtain hydrophilic polymer<br><br>
WO 2005/000334	PCT/US2004/017204<br>
23<br>
encapsulated granules of amphetamine-conjugate. The resulting granulation may be<br>
milled, screened, then blended with various pharmaceutical additives such as, water<br>
insoluble polymers, and/or additional hydrophilic polymers. The formulation may<br>
then tableted and may further be film coated with a protective coating which rapidly<br>
dissolves or disperses in gastric juices.<br>
[125] However, it should be noted that the amphetamine conjugate controls the<br>
release of amphetamine into the digestive tract over an extended period of time<br>
resulting in an improved profile when compared to immediate release combinations<br>
and prevention of abuse without the addition of the above additives. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, no further sustained release additives are required to achieve a blunted<br>
or reduced pharmacokinetic curve (e.g., reduced euphoric effect) while achieving<br>
therapeutically effective amounts of amphetamine release when taken orally.<br>
[126] The compounds of the invention can be administered by a variety of dosage<br>
forms. Any biologically-acceptable dosage form known to persons of ordinary skill<br>
in the art, and combinations thereof, are contemplated. Examples of preferred<br>
dosage forms include, without limitation, chewable tablets, quick dissolve tablets,<br>
effervescent tablets, reconstitutable powders, elixirs, liquids, solutions, suspensions,<br>
emulsions, tablets, multi-layer tablets, bi-layer tablets, capsules, soft gelatin<br>
capsules, hard gelatin capsules, caplets, lozenges, chewable lozenges, beads,<br>
powders, granules, particles, microparticles, dispersible granules, cachets and<br>
combinations thereof.<br>
[127] The most effective means for delivering the abuse-resistant compounds of<br>
the invention is orally, to permit maximum release of the amphetamine, and provide<br>
therapeutic effectiveness and/or sustained release while maintaining abuse<br>
resistance. When delivered by oral route the amphetamine is released into<br>
circulation, preferably over an extended period of time as compared to amphetamine<br>
alone.<br>
[128] Formulations of the invention suitable for oral administration can be<br>
presented as discrete units, such as capsules, caplets or tablets. These oral<br>
formulations also can comprise a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid or a<br><br>
WO 2005/000334	PCT/US2004/017204<br>
24<br>
non-aqueous liquid. The formulation can be an emulsion, such as an oil-in-water<br>
liquid emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. The oils can be administered by<br>
adding the purified and sterilized liquids to a prepared enteral formula, which is then<br>
placed in the feeding tube of a patient who is unable to swallow.<br>
[129] Soft gel or soft gelatin capsules may be prepared, for example by dispersing<br>
the formulation in an appropriate vehicle (vegetable oils are commonly used) to<br>
form a high viscosity mixture. This mixture is then encapsulated with a gelatin<br>
based film using technology and machinery known to those in the soft gel industry.<br>
The industrial units so formed are then dried to constant weight.<br>
[130] Chewable tablets, for example may be prepared by mixing the formulations<br>
with excipients designed to form a relatively soft, flavored, tablet dosage form that is<br>
intended to be chewed rather than swallowed. Conventional tablet machinery and<br>
procedures, that is both direct compression and granulation, i.e., or slugging, before<br>
compression, can be utilized. Those individuals involved in pharmaceutical solid<br>
dosage form production are versed in the processes and the machinery used as the<br>
chewable dosage form is a very common dosage form in the pharmaceutical<br>
industry.<br>
[131] Film-coated tablets, for example may be prepared by coating tablets using<br>
techniques such as rotating pan coating methods or air suspension methods to<br>
deposit a contiguous film layer on a tablet.<br>
[132] Compressed tablets, for example may be prepared by mixing the formulation<br>
with excipients intended to add binding qualities to disintegration qualities. The<br>
mixture is either directly compressed or granulated then compressed using methods<br>
and machinery known to those in the industry. The resultant compressed tablet<br>
dosage units are then packaged according to market need, i.e., unit dose, rolls, bulk<br>
bottles, blister packs, etc.<br>
[133] The invention also contemplates the use of biologically-acceptable carriers<br>
which may be prepared from a wide range of materials. Without being limited<br>
thereto, such materials include diluents, binders and adhesives, lubricants,<br>
plasticizers, disintegrants, colorants, bulking substances, flavorings, sweeteners and<br><br>
WO 2005/000334	PCT/US2004/017204<br>
25<br>
miscellaneous materials such as buffers and adsorbents in order to prepare a<br>
particular medicated composition.<br>
[134] Binders may be selected from a wide range of materials such as<br>
hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, ethylcellulose, or other suitable cellulose derivatives,<br>
povidone, acrylic and methacrylic acid co-polymers, pharmaceutical glaze, gums,<br>
milk derivatives, such as whey, starches, and derivatives, as well as other<br>
conventional binders known to persons skilled in the art. Exemplary non-limiting<br>
solvents are water, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, methylene chloride or mixtures and<br>
combinations thereof. Exemplary non-limiting bulking substances include sugar,<br>
lactose, gelatin, starch, and silicon dioxide.<br>
[135] Preferred plasticizers may be selected from the group consisting of diethyl<br>
phthalate, diethyl sebacate, triethyl citrate, cronotic acid, propylene glycol, butyl<br>
phthalate, dibutyl sebacate, castor oil and mixtures thereof, without limitation. As is<br>
evident, the plasticizers may be hydrophobic as well as hydrophilic in nature.<br>
Water-insoluble hydrophobic substances, such as diethyl phthalate, diethyl sebacate<br>
and castor oil are used to delay the release of water-soluble vitamins, such as<br>
vitamin B6 and vitamin C. In contrast, hydrophilic plasticizers are used when water-<br>
insoluble vitamins are employed which aid in dissolving the encapsulated film,<br>
making channels in the surface, which aid in nutritional composition release.<br>
[136] It should be understood that in addition to the ingredients particularly<br>
mentioned above, the formulations of this invention can include other suitable<br>
agents such as flavoring agents, preservatives and antioxidants. Such antioxidants<br>
would be food acceptable and could include vitamin E, carotene, BHT or other<br>
antioxidants known to those of skill in the art.<br>
[137] Other compounds which may be included by admixture are, for example,<br>
medically inert ingredients, e.g., solid and liquid diluent, such as lactose, dextrose,<br>
saccharose, cellulose, starch or calcium phosphate for tablets or capsules, olive oil or<br>
ethyl oleate for soft capsules and water or vegetable oil for suspensions or<br>
emulsions; lubricating agents such as silica, talc, stearic acid, magnesium or calcium<br>
stearate and/or polyethylene glycols; gelling agents such as colloidal days;<br><br>
WO 2005/000334	PCT/US2004/017204<br>
26<br>
thickening agents such as gum tragacanth or sodium alginate, binding agents such as<br>
starches, arabic gums, gelatin, methylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose or<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone; disintegrating agents such as starch, alginic acid, alginates or<br>
sodium starch glycolate; effervescing mixtures; dyestuff; sweeteners; wetting agents<br>
such as lecithin, polysorbates or laurylsulphates; and other therapeutically<br>
acceptable accessory ingredients, such as humectants, preservatives, buffers and<br>
antioxidants, which are known additives for such formulations.<br>
[138] For oral administration, fine powders or granules containing diluting,<br>
dispersing and/or surface-active agents may be presented in a draught, in water or a<br>
syrup, in capsules or sachets in the dry state, in a non-aqueous suspension wherein<br>
suspending agents may be included, or in a suspension in water or a syrup. Where<br>
desirable or necessary, flavoring, preserving, suspending, thickening or emulsifying<br>
agents can be included.<br>
[139] Liquid dispersions for oral administration may be syrups, emulsions or<br>
suspensions. The syrups may contain as carrier, for example, saccharose or<br>
saccharose with glycerol and/or mannitol and/or sorbitol. The suspensions and the<br>
emulsions may contain a carrier, for example a natural gum, agar, sodium alginate,<br>
pectin, methylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose or polyvinyl alcohol.<br>
[140] The dose range for adult human beings will depend on a number of factors<br>
including the age, weight and condition of the patient. Tablets and other forms of<br>
presentation provided in discrete units conveniently contain a daily dose, or an<br>
appropriate fraction thereof, of one or more of the compounds of the invention. For<br>
example, units may contain from 5 mg to 500 mg, but more usually from 10 mg to<br>
250 mg, of one or more of the compounds of the invention.<br>
[141] It is also possible for the dosage form to combine any forms of release<br>
known to persons of ordinary skill in the art. These include immediate release,<br>
extended release, pulse release, variable release, controlled release, timed release,<br>
sustained release, delayed release, long acting, and combinations thereof. The<br>
ability to obtain immediate release, extended release, pulse release, variable release,<br><br>
WO 2005/000334	PCT/US2004/017204<br>
27<br>
controlled release, timed release, sustained release, delayed release, long acting<br>
characteristics and combinations thereof is known in the art.<br>
[142] Compositions of the invention may be administered in a partial, i.e.,<br>
fractional dose, one or more times during a 24 hour period, a single dose during a 24<br>
hour period of time, a double dose during a 24 hour period of time, or more than a<br>
double dose during a 24 hour period of time. Fractional, double or other multiple<br>
doses may be taken simultaneously or at different times during the 24 hour period.<br>
The doses may be uneven doses with regard to one another or with regard to the<br>
individual components at different administration times.<br>
[143] Likewise, the compositions of the invention may be provided in a blister<br>
pack or other such pharmaceutical package. Further, the compositions of the present<br>
inventive subject matter may further include or be accompanied by indicia allowing<br>
individuals to identify the compositions as products for a prescribed treatment. The<br>
indicia may additionally include an indication of the above specified time periods<br>
for administering the compositions. For example, the indicia may be time indicia<br>
indicating a specific or general time of day for administration of the composition, or<br>
the indicia may be a day indicia indicating a day of the week for administration of<br>
the composition. The blister pack or other combination package may also include a<br>
second pharmaceutical product.<br>
[144] It will be appreciated that the pharmacological activity of the compositions<br>
of the invention can be demonstrated using standard pharmacological models that<br>
are known in the art. Furthermore, it will be appreciated that the inventive<br>
compositions can be incorporated or encapsulated in a suitable polymer matrix or<br>
membrane for site-specific delivery, or can be functionalized with specific targeting<br>
agents capable of effecting site specific delivery. These techniques, as well as other<br>
drug delivery techniques, are well known in the art.<br>
[145] In another embodiment of the invention, the solubility and dissolution rate of<br>
the composition is substantially changed under physiological conditions encountered<br>
in the intestine, at mucosal surfaces, or in the bloodstream. In another embodiment<br>
the solubility and dissolution rate substantially decrease the bioavailability of the<br><br>
WO 2005/000334	PCT/US2004/017204<br>
28<br>
amphetamine, particularly at doses above those intended for therapy. In another<br>
embodiment, the decrease in bioavailability occurs upon intranasal administration.<br>
In another embodiment, the decrease in bioavailability occurs upon intravenous<br>
administration.<br>
[146] For each of the described embodiments, one or more of the following<br>
characteristics may be realized: The toxicity of the amphetamine conjugate is<br>
substantially lower than that of the unbound amphetamine. The covalently bound<br>
chemical moiety reduces or eliminates the possibility of overdose by oral<br>
administration. The covalently bound chemical moiety reduces or eliminates the<br>
possibility of overdose or abuse by intranasal administration. The covalently bound<br>
chemical moiety reduces or eliminates the possibility of overdose or abuse by<br>
injection.<br>
[147] The invention further provides methods for altering amphetamines in a<br>
manner that decreases their potential for abuse. Methods of the invention provide<br>
various ways to regulate pharmaceutical dosage through covalent attachment of<br>
amphetamine to different chemical moieties. One embodiment provides a method of<br>
preventing overdose comprising administering to an individual amphetamine which<br>
has been covalently bound to a chemical moiety.<br>
[148] Another embodiment provides a method of safely delivering amphetamine<br>

unbound amphetamine.<br>
[149] Another embodiment provides a method of reducing amphetamine toxicity<br>
comprising providing a patient with amphetamine which has been covalently bound<br>

doses exceeding those within the therapeutic range of amphetamine.<br>
[150] Another embodiment provides a method of reducing amphetamine toxicity<br>

which does not increase above the amphetamine's toxicity level when given at doses<br>
exceeding those within the therapeutic range for the unbound amphetamine.<br>
[151] Another embodiment provides a method of reducing bioavailability of<br>
amphetamine comprising providing amphetamine covalently bound to a chemical<br>

or increase blood serum concentrations compared to unbound amphetamine when<br>
given at doses exceeding those within the therapeutic range for the unbound<br>
amphetamine.<br>
[152] Another embodiment provides a method of preventing a Cmax spike for<br>
amphetamine while still providing a therapeutically effective bioavailability curve<br>
comprising providing amphetamine which has been covalently bound to a chemical<br>
moiety.<br>

curves similar to those of Figures 6-55.<br>
[154] Another embodiment provides a method for preventing a toxic release profile<br>
in a patient comprising administering to a patient amphetamine covalently bound to<br>
a chemical moiety, wherein said bound amphetamine maintains a steady-state serum<br>

spiking or increase blood serum concentrations compared to unbound amphetamine,<br>
particularly when taken at doses above prescribed amounts.<br>
[155] Another embodiment of the invention is a method for reducing or preventing<br>
abuse of amphetamine comprising providing, administering, or prescribing said<br>

[179] Male Sprague-Dawley rats were provided water ad libitum, fasted overnight<br>
and dosed by oral gavage L-lysine-d-amphetamine or d-amphetamine sulfate. In all<br>
studies doses contained equivalent amounts of d-amphetamine base. Plasma d-<br>
amphetamine concentrations were measured by ELISA (Amphetamine Ultra,<br>

amphetamine with only minimal reactivity (0.6%) of the major d-amphetamine<br>
metabolite (para-hydroxy-d-amphetamine) occurring. L-Iysine-d-amphetamine was<br>
also determined to be essentially unreactive in the ELISA (

[181] Example 6 illustrates that when lysine is conjugated to the active agent<br>
amphetamine the peak levels of amphetamine are decreased while bioavailability is<br>
maintained approximately equal to amphetamine. The bioavailability of<br>
amphetamine released from L-lysine-d-amphetamine is similar to that of<br>
amphetamine sulfate at the equivalent dose, thus L-lysine-d-amphetamine maintains<br>
its therapeutic value. The gradual release of amphetamine from L-lysine-d-<br>
amphetamine and decrease in peak levels reduce the possibility of overdose.<br>

Example 8: Oral bioavailability of L-lysine-d-amphetamine at various doses<br>
approximating a range of therapeutic human doses compared to a<br>
suprapharmacological dose<br>
[183] Male Sprague-Dawley rats were provided water ad libitum, fasted overnight<br>
and dosed by oral gavage with 1.5, 3,6, 12, and 60 mg/kg of amphetamine sulfate or<br>
L-lysine-d-amphetamine containing the equivalent amounts of d-amphetamine.<br>
Concentrations of d-amphetamine were measured by ELISA.<br>
[184] It has been demonstrated that when lysine is conjugated to the active agent d-<br>
amphetamine the levels of d-amphetamine at 30 minutes post-administration are<br>
decreased by approximately 50% over a dose range of 1.5 to 12 mg/kg. However,<br>
when a suprapharmcological dose (60 mg/kg) is given the levels of d-amphetamine<br>
from L-lysine-d-amphetamine only reached 8% of those seen for d-amphetamine<br>
sulfate (Tables 8 and 9, Fig. 10). The substantial decrease in oral bioavailability at a<br>
high dose greatly reduces the abuse potential of L-lysine-d-amphetamine.<br>

[185] An additional oral PK study illustrated in Fig. 11 shows the d-amphetamine<br>
blood levels of a 60 mg/kg dose over an 8 h time course. In the case of d-<br>
amphetamine blood levels quickly reached a very high level and 8 of 12 animals<br>
either died or were sacrificed due to acute symptoms of toxicity. Blood levels<br><br>

(Dexadrine Spansule capsules) were orally administered to rats as intact capsules or<br>
as crushed capsules and compared to a dose of L-lysine-d-amphetamine containing<br>
an equivalent amount of d-amphetamine base (Fig. 14). The crushed capsules<br>
showed an increase in CmaX and AUCinf of 84 and 13 percent, respectively, as<br>

Example 13. Oral Bioavaialabilitv of L-lvsine-d-amphetamine compared to d-<br>
amphetamine at escalating doses.<br>
[191] As shown in Figs. 15-19, the fraction of intact L-lysine-d-amphetamine<br>
absorbed following oral administration in rats increased non-linearly in proportion to<br>
escalating doses from 1.5 to 12 mg/kg (d-amphetamine base). The fraction absorbed<br>
at 1.5 mg/kg was only 2.6 percent whereas it increased to 24.6 percent by 12 mg/kg.<br>
The fraction absorbed fell to 9.3 percent at the high dose of 60 mg/kg. Tmax ranged<br>
from 0.25 to 3 hours and peak concentrations occurred earlier than for d-<br>
amphetamine in L-lysine-d-amphetamine dosed rats. L-lysine-d-amphetamine was<br>
cleared more rapidly than d-amphetamine with nearly undetectable concentrations<br>
by 8 hours at the lowest dose.<br>
[192] Tmax for d-amphetamine from L-lysine-d-amphetamine ranged from 1.5 to 5<br>
hours as compared to 0.5 to 1.5 following administration of d-amphetamine sulfate.<br>
The difference in time to reach maximum concentration was greater at higher doses.<br>
Cmax of d-amphetamine following oral delivery of L-lysine-d-amphetamine was<br>
reduced by approximately half as compared to Cmax following i-amphetamine<br>
sulfate administration at doses of 1.5 to 6 mg/kg, approximating human equivalent<br>
doses (HEDs) in the therapeutic range (HED d-amphetamine sulfate; 19.9 to 39.9<br>
mg). HEDs are defined as the equivalent dose for a 60 kg person in accordance to<br>
the body surface area of the animal model. The adjustment factor for rats is 6.2. The<br>
HED for a rat dose of 1.5 mg/kg of d-amphetamine, for example, is equivalent to<br><br>
WO 2005/000334	PCT/US2004/017204<br>
45<br>
1.5/6.2 x 60 = 14.52 d-amphetamine base; which is equivalent to 14.52/.7284 = 19.9<br>
mg d-amphetamine sulfate, when adjusted for the salt content.<br>
[193] At doses above HEDs in the targeted therapeutic range (12 and 60 mg/kg;<br>
HED d-amphetamine sulfate 79.8 and 399 mg), Cmax was reduced by 73 and 84<br>
percent, respectively, as compared to d-amphetamine sulfate. AUCs of d-<br>
amphetamine following oral administration of L-lysine-d-amphetamine were similar<br>
to those of d-amphetamine sulfate at lower doses. As observed with Cmax, however,<br>
the AUCs for d-amphetamine from L-lysine-d-arnphetamine were substantially<br>
decreased compared to those of d-amphetamine sulfate at higher doses with the<br>
AUCinf reduced by 76% at the highest dose (60 mg/kg; HED 399 mg d-amphetamine<br>
sulfate.<br>
[194] In summary, oral bio availability of d-amphetamine from L-lysine-d-<br>
amphetamine decreased to some degree at higher doses in rats. However,<br>
pharmacokinetics with respect to dose were nearly linear for L-lysine-d-<br>
amphetamine at doses from 1.5 to 60 mg/kg (HED d-amphetamine sulfate; 19.9 to<br>
797.2 mg) with the fraction absorbed ranging from 52 to 81 percent (extrapolated<br>
form 1.5 mg/kg dose). Pharmacokinetics of d-amphetamine sulfate was also nearly<br>
linear at lower doses of 1.5 to 6 mg/kg (HED; 19.9 to 79.7) with the fraction<br>
absorbed ranging form 62 to 84. In contrast to L-lysine-d-amphetamine, however,<br>
parameters were disproportionately increased at higher doses for d-amphetamine<br>
sulfate with the fraction absorbed calculated as 101 and 223 percent (extrapolated<br>
form 1.5 mg/kg dose), respectively, for the suprapharmacological doses of 12 and 60<br>
mg/kg (HED d-amphetamine sulfate; 159.4 and 797.2 mg).<br>
[195] The results suggest that the capacity for clearance of d-amphetamine when<br>
delivered as the sulfate salt becomes saturated at the higher doses whereas the<br>
gradual hydrolysis of L-lysine-d-amphetamine precludes saturation of d-<br>
amphetamine elimination at higher doses. The difference in proportionality of dose<br>
to bioavailability (Cmax and AUC) for d-amphetamine and L-lysine-d-amphetamine<br>
is illustrated in Figs. 20-22. The pharmacokinetic properties of L-lysine-d-<br>
amphetamine as compared to d-amphetamine at the higher doses decrease the ability<br><br>
WO 2005/000334	PCT/US2004/017204<br>
46<br>
to escalate doses. This improves the safety and reduces the abuse liability of L-<br>
Iysine-d-amphetamine as a method of delivering d-amphetamine for the treatment of<br>
ADHD or other indicated conditions.<br>
Example 14. Intranasal Bioavailability of L-lvsine-d-amphetamine compared to d-<br>
amphetamine.<br>
[196] As shown in Figs. 23-24, bioavailability of d-amphetamine following bolus<br>
intranasal administration of L-lysine-d-amphetamine was approximately 5 percent of<br>
that of the equivalent d-amphetamine sulfate dose with AUCinf values of 56 and<br>
1032, respectively. Cmax of d-amphetamine following L-lysine-d-amphetamine<br>
administration by the intranasal route was also about 5 percent of that of the<br>
equivalent amount of d-amphetamine sulfate with values of 78.6 ng/mL and 1962.9<br>
ng/mL, respectively. As with intravenous administration, Tmax of d-amphetamine<br>
concentration was delayed substantially for L-lysine-d-amphetamine (60 minutes) as<br>
compared to Tmax of d-amphetamine sulfate (5 minutes), again reflecting the gradual<br>
hydrolysis of L-lysine-d-amphetamine. A high concentration of intact L-lysine-d-<br>
amphetamine was detected following intranasal dosing suggesting that the large<br>
decrease in bioavailability of d-amphetamine was due to minimal hydrolysis of L-<br>
lysine-d-amphetamine when delivered by this route. It appears that only minimal<br>
amounts of d-amphetamine can be delivered by intranasal administration of L-<br>
lysine-d-amphetamine.<br>
Example 15. Intravenous Bioavaialabilitv of L-lysine-d-amphetamine compared to<br>
d-amphetamine.<br>
[197] As shown in Figs. 25-26, bioavailability of d-amphetamine following bolus<br>
intravenous administration of L-lysine-d-amphetamine was approximately one-half<br>
that of the equivalent d-amphetamine sulfate dose with AUCinf values of 237.8 and<br>
420.2, respectively. Cmax of d-amphetamine following L-lysine-d-amphetamine<br>
administration was only about one-fourth that of the equivalent amount of d-<br>
amphetamine with values of 99.5 and 420.2, respectively. Tmax of d-amphetamine<br>
concentration was delayed substantially for L-lysine-d-amphetamine (30 minutes) as<br>
compared to Tmax of d-amphetamine sulfate (5 minutes), reflecting the gradual<br>
hydrolysis of L-lysine-d-amphetamine. In conclusion, the bioavailability of d-<br><br>
WO 2005/000334	PCT/US2004/017204<br>
47<br>
amphetamine by the intravenous route is substantially decreased and delayed when<br>
given as L-lysine-d-amphetamine. Moreover, bioavailability is less than that<br>
obtained by oral administration of the equivalent dose of L-lysine-d-amphetamine.<br>

Example 19. LC/MS/MS analysis of Bioavailability in Dogs<br>
Example Experimental Design:<br>
[202] This was a non-randomized, two-treatment crossover study. All animals<br>
were maintained on their normal diet and were fasted overnight prior to each dose<br>
administration. L-lysine-d-amphetamine dose was based on the body weight<br>
measured on the morning of each dosing day. The actual dose delivered was based<br>
on syringe weight before and after dosing. Serial blood samples were obtained from<br>
each animal by direct venipuncture of a jugular vein using vacutainer tubes<br>
containing sodium heparin as the anticoagulant. Derived plasma samples were<br><br>
WO 2005/000334	PCT/US2004/017204<br>
53<br>
stored frozen until shipment to the Quest Pharmaceutical Services, Inc. (Newark,<br>
DE). Pharmacokinetic analysis of the plasma assay results was conducted by<br>
Calvert. Animals were treated as follows:<br><br>

3M	IV	2	1	2	2<br>
The mg units in the dose concentration and dose level refer to the free base form of<br>
test article.<br>
Administration of the Test Article:<br>
[203] Oral: The test article was administered to each animal via a single oral<br>
gavagc. On Day 1, animals received the oral dose by gavage using an esophageal<br>
tube attached to a syringe. Dosing tubes were flushed with approximately 20 mL tap<br>
water to ensure the required dosing solution was delivered.<br>
[204] Intravenous: On Day 8, animals received L-lysine-d-amphetamine as a<br>
single 30-minute intravenous infusion into a cephalic vein.<br>
Sample Collection:<br>
[205] Dosing Formulations: Post-dosing, remaining dosing formulation was saved<br>
and stored frozen.<br>
[206] Blood: Serial blood samples (2 mL) were collected using venipuncture tubes<br>
containing sodium heparin. Blood samples were taken at 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12,<br>
24, 48, and 72 hours post-oral dosing. Blood samples were collected at 0, 0.167,<br>
0.33", 0.49 (prior to stop of infusion), 0.583, 0.667, 0.75, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, and 23<br>
hours post-intravenous infusion start. Collected blood samples were chilled<br>
immediately.<br>
[207] Plasma: Plasma samples were obtained by centrifugation of blood samples.<br>
Duplicate plasma samples (about 0.2 mL each) were transferred into prelabeled<br>
plastic vials and stored frozen at approximately -70Â°C.<br><br>
WO 2005/000334	PCT/US2004/017204<br>
54<br>
Sample Assay:<br>
[208] Plasma samples were analyzed for L-lysine-d-amphetamine and d-<br>
amphetamine using a validated LC-MS/MS method with an LLOQ of 1 ng/mL for<br>
both analytes.<br>
[209] Microsoft Excel (Version 6, Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA) was used for<br>
calculation of mean plasma concentration and graphing of the plasma concentration-<br>
time data. Pharmacokinetic analysis (non-compartmental) was performed using the<br>
WinNonlinÂ® software program (Version 4.1, Pharsight, Inc. Mountain View, CA).<br>
The maximum concentration, CmaX, and the time to Cmax, Tmax, were observed values.<br>
The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) was determined using<br>
linear-log trapezoidal rules. The apparent terminal rate constant (ï¬z) was derived<br>
using linear least-squares regression with visual inspection of the data to determine<br>
the appropriate number of points (minimum of 3 data points) for calculating ï¬z. The<br>
AUC(O-inf) was calculated as the sum of AUC(0-t) and Cpred/ï¬z, where Cpred was<br>
the predicted concentration at the time of the last quantifiable concentration. The<br>
plasma clearance (CL/F) was determined as the ratio of Dose/AUC (0-inf). The<br>
mean residence time (MRT) was calculated as the ratio of AUMC(0-inf)/AUC (0-<br>
inf), where AUMC(O-inf) was the area under the first moment curve from the time<br>
zero to infinity. The volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) was estimated as<br>
CL*MRT. Half-life was calculated as In2/ï¬z. The oral bioavailability (F) was<br>
calculated as the ratio of AUC(O-inf) following oral dosing to AUC(O-inf) following<br>
intravenous dosing. Descriptive statistics (mean and standard deviation) of the<br>
pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using Microsoft Excel.<br>
[210] The objectives of this study were to characterize the pharmacokinetics of L-<br>
lysine-d-amphetamine and d-amphetamine following administration of L-lysine-d-<br>
amphetamine in male beagle dogs. As shown in Fig. 27, in a cross-over design, L-<br>
lysine-d-amphetamine was administered to 3 male beagle dogs orally (2 mg/kg) and<br>
intravenously (2 mg/kg, 30-minute infusion). Blood samples were collected up to<br>
24 and 72 hour after the intravenous and oral does, respectively. Plasma samples<br><br>
WO 2005/000334	PCT/US2004/017204<br>
55<br>
were analyzed using a LC-MS/MS assay which provided an LLOQ of 1 ng/mL for<br>
both analytes.<br>
[211] The mean L-lysine-d-amphetamine and d-amphetamine plasma<br>
concentration-time profiles following an intravenous or oral dose of L-Iysine-d-<br>
amphetamine are presented in Figs. 29 and 30, respectively. Comparative profiles of<br>
L-lysine-d-amphetamine to d-amphetamine following both routes are depicted in<br>
Figs. 27-28. Individual plots are depicted in Figs. 31-32. The pharmacokinetic<br>
parameters are summarized in Tables 29-37.<br>
[212] Following a 30-minute intravenous infusion of L-lysine-d-amphetamine, the<br>
plasma concentration reached a peak at the end of the infusion. Post-infusion L-<br>
lysine-d-amphetamine concentration declined very rapidly in a biexponential<br>
manner, and fell below the quantifiable limit (1 ng/mL) by approximately 8 hours<br>
post-dose. Results of non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis indicate that L-<br>
lysine-d-amphetamine is a high clearance compound with a moderate volume of<br>
distribution (Vss) approximating total body water (0.7 L/kg). The mean clearance<br>
value was 2087 ml7hâ¢kg (34.8 mL/minâ¢kg) and was similar to the hepatic blood<br>
flow in the dog (40 mL/minâ¢kg). Consequently, L-lysine-d-amphetamine is a<br>
moderate to high hepatic extraction compound with significant first pass effects<br>
(including the conversion to d-amphetamine) following oral administration.<br>
[213] L-lysine-d-amphetamine was rapidly absorbed after oral administration with<br>
Tmax at 0.5 hours in all three dogs. Mean absolute oral bioavailablity was 33%.<br>
Since significant first pass effects are expected for L-lysine-d-amphetamine, a 33%<br>
bioavailability suggests that L-lysine-d-amphetamine is very well absorbed in the<br>
dog. The apparent terminal half-life was 0.39 hours, indicating rapid elimination, as<br>
observed following intravneous administration.<br>
[214] Plasma concentration-time profiles of d-amphetamine following intravenous<br>
or oral administration of L-lysine-d-amphetamine were very similar, with Cmax, Tmax<br>
and AUC values for both routes essentially the same. At a 2 mg/kg oral dose of L-<br>
lysine-d-amphetamine, the mean Cmax of d-amphetamine was 104.3 ng/mL. The<br><br>
WO 2005/000334	PCT/US2004/017204<br>
56<br>
half-life of d-amphetamine was 3.1 to 3.5 hours, much longer when compared to L-<br>
lysine-d- amphetamine.<br>
[215] In this study, L-lysine-d-amphetamine was infused over a 30 minute time<br>
period. Due to rapid clearance of L-lysine-d-amphetamine it is likely that<br>
bioavailability of d-amphetamine from L-lysine-d-amphetamine would decrease if a<br>
similar dose were given by intravenous bolus injection. Even when given as an<br>
infusion the bioavailability of d-amphetamine from L-lysine-d-amphetamine did not<br>
exceed that of a similar dose given orally and the time to peak concentration was<br>
substantially delayed. This data further supports that L-lysine-d-amphetamine<br>
affords a decrease in the abuse liability of d-amphetamine by intravenous injection.<br>

Example 20. Delayed Cardiovascular Effects of L-lysine-d-amphetamine as<br>
Compared to d-amphetamine Following Intravenous Infusion.<br>
[216] Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) are increased by d-amphetamine<br>
even at therapeutic doses. Since L-lysine-d-amphetamine is expected to release d-<br>
amphetamine (albeit slowly) as a result of systemic metabolism, a preliminary study<br>
was done using equimolar doses of d-amphetamine or L-lysine-d-amphetamine to 4<br>
dogs (2 male and 2 female). The results suggest that the amide prodrug is inactive<br>
and that slow release of some d-amphetarmne, occurs beginning 20 minutes after the<br>
first dose. Relative to d-amphetamine, however, the effects are less robust. For<br>
example, the mean blood pressure is graphed in Fig. 35. Consistent with previously<br>
published data (Kohli and Goldberg, 1982), small doses of d-amphetamine were<br>
observed to have rapid effects on blood pressure. The lowest dose (0.202 mg/kg,<br>
equimolar to 0.5 mg/kg of L-lysine-d-amphetamine) produced an acute doubling of<br>
the mean BP followed by a slow recovery over 30 minutes.<br>
[217] By contrast, L-lysine-d-amphetamine produced very little change in mean<br>
BP until approximately 30 minutes after injection. At that time, pressure increased<br>
by about 20-50%. Continuous release of d-amphetamine is probably responsible for<br>
the slow and steady increase in blood pressure over the remaining course of the<br>
experiment. Upon subsequent injections, d-amphetamine is seen to repeat its effect<br><br>
WO 2005/000334	PCT/US2004/017204<br>
61<br>
in a non-dose dependent fashion. That is, increasing dose 10-fold from the first<br>
injection produced a rise to the same maximum pressure. This may reflect the state<br>
of catecholamine levels in nerve terminals upon successive stimulation of d-<br>
amphetamine bolus injections. Note that the rise in mean blood pressure seen after<br>
successive doses of L-Iysine-d-amphetamine (Fig. 35) produces a more gradual and<br>
less intense effect. Similar results were observed for left ventricular pressure (Fig.<br>
36). These results further substantiate the significant decrease in d-amphetamine<br>
bioavailability by the intravenous route when given as L-Iysine-d-amphetamine. As<br>
a result the rapid onset of the pharmacological effect of d-amphetamine that is<br>
sought by persons injecting the drug is eliminated.<br>

Example 21. Pharmacodynamic (Locomotor) Response to Amphetamine vs. L-<br>
lysine-d-amphetamine by Oral Administration<br>
[218] Male Sprague-Dawley rats were provided water ad libitum, fasted overnight<br>
and dosed by oral gavage with 6 mg/kg of amphetamine or L-lysine-d-amphetamine<br>
containing the equivalent amount of d-amphetamine. Horizontal locomotor activity<br>
(HLA) was recorded during the light cycle using photocell activity chambers (San<br>
Diego Instruments). Total counts were recorded every 12 minutes for the duration<br>
of the test. Rats were monitored in three separate experiments for 5, 8, and 12<br><br>
WO 2005/000334	PCT/US2004/017204<br>
63<br>
hours, respectively. Time vs. HLA counts for d-amphetamine vs. L-lysine-d-<br>
amphetamine is shown in Figs. 37-38. In each experiment the time until peak<br>
activity was delayed and the pharmacodynamic effect was evident for an extended<br>
period of time for L-lysine-d-amphetamine as compared to d-amphetamine. The<br>
total activity counts for HLA of Lys-Amp dosed rats were increased (11-41%) over<br>
those induced by d-amphetamine in all three experiments (Tables 40 and 41).<br>

Example 22. Pharmacodynamic Response to Amphetamine vs. L-lvsine-d-<br>
amphetamine by Intranasal Administration<br>
[219] Male Sprague-Dawley rats were dosed by intranasal administration with 1.0<br>
mg/kg of amphetamine or L-lysine-d-amphetamine containing the equivalent<br>
amount of d-amphetamine. In a second set of similarly dosed animals<br>
carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) was added to the drug solutions at a concentration<br>
of 62.6 mg/ml (approximately 2-fold higher than the concentration of L-lysine-d-<br>
amphetamine and 5-fold higher than the d-amphetamine content). The CMC drug<br>
mixtures were suspended thoroughly before each dose was delivered. Locomotor<br><br>
WO 2005/000334	PCT/US2004/017204<br>
64<br>
activity was monitored using the procedure described in the section titled example 7.<br>
As shown in Figs. 39-40, the activity vs. time (1 hour or 2 hours) is shown for<br>
amphetamine/CMC vs. L-lysine-d-amphetamine and compared to that of<br>
amphetamine vs. L-lysine-d-amphetamine CMC. As seen in Fig. 39, addition of<br>
CMC to L-lysine-d-amphetamine decreased the activity response of IN dosed rats to<br>
levels similar to the water/CMC control, whereas no effect was seen on<br>
amphetamine activity by the addition of CMC. The increase in activity over<br>
baseline of L-lysine-d-amphetamine with CMC was only 9% compared to 34% for<br>
Lys-Amp without CMC when compared to activity observed for d-amphetamine<br>
dosed animals (Table 42). CMC had no observable affect on d-amphetamine<br>
activity induced by IN administration.<br>

â¢	AH animals in Groups 4-6 exhibited increased motor activity within<br>

â¢	One female rat dosed at 1000 mg/kg was found dead on Day 2.<br>
Necropsy revealed chromodacryorrhea, chromorhinorrhea, distended<br>
stomach (gas), enlarged adrenal glands, and edematous and distended<br>
intestines.<br>
â¢	A total of 4 rats had skin lesions of varying degrees of severity on<br>
Day 3.<br>
â¢	One male rat dosed at 1000 mg/kg was euthanatized on Day 3 due to<br>
open skin lesions on the ventral neck.<br>
â¢	All remaining animals appeared normal from Day 4 through Day 7.<br>
[223] Animals were observed for signs of toxicity at 1, 2 and 4 h post-dose, and<br>
once daily for 7 days after dosing and cage-side observations were recorded.<br>
Animals found dead, or sacrificed moribund were necropsied and discarded, A total<br>
of one animal/sex/group was necropsied upon scheduled or unscheduled death.<br>
[224] Cage-side observations and gross necropsy findings are summarized in Table<br>
5. The data are not sufficient to establish a lethal dose, however, the study indicates<br>
that the lethal oral dose of L-lysine-d-amphetamine is above 1000 mg/kg, because<br>
only one death occurred out of a group of six animals. Although a second animal in<br>
this dose group was euthanatized on Day 3, it was done for humane reasons and it<br>
was felt that this animal would have fully recovered. Observations suggested drug-<br>
induced stress in Groups 4-6 that is characteristic of amphetamine toxicity (NTP,<br>
1990; NIOSH REGISTRY NUMBER: SI1750000; Goodman et. al. 1985). All<br>
animals showed no abnormal signs on Days 4-7 suggesting full recovery at each<br>
treatment level.<br>
[225] The lack of data to support an established lethal dose is believed to be due to<br>
a putative protective effect of conjugating amphetamine with lysine. Intact L-lysine-<br>
d-amphetamine has been shown to be inactive, but becomes active upon metabolism<br>
into the unconjugated form (d-amphetamine). Thus, at high doses, saturation of<br><br>
WO 2005/000334	PCT/US2004/017204<br>
67<br>
metabolism of L-lysine-d-amphetamine into the unconjugated form may explain the<br>
lack of observed toxicity, which was expected at doses greater than 100 mg/kg,<br>
which is consistent with d-amphetamine sulfate (NTP, 1990). The formation rate of<br>
d-amphetamine and the extent of the formation of amphetamine may both attribute<br>
to the reduced toxicity. Alternatively, oral absorption of L-lysine-d-amphetamine<br>
may also be saturated at such high concentrations, which may suggest low toxicity<br>
due to limited bioavailability of L-lysine-d-amphetamine.<br>

Activity.<br>
[226] It was anticipated that the acylation of amphetamine, as in the amino acid<br>
conjugates discussed here, would significantly reduce the stimulant activity of the<br>
parent drug. For example, Marvola (1976) showed that N-acetylation of<br>
amphetamine completely abolished the locomotor activity increasing effects in mice.<br>
To confirm that the conjugate was not directly acting as a stimulant, we tested<br>
(Novascreen, Hanover, MD) the specific binding of Lys-Amp (10"9 to 10'5 M) to<br>
human recombinant dopamine and norepinephrine transport binding sites using<br>
standard radioligand binding assays. The results (see Table 45) indicate that the<br>
Lys-Amp did not bind to these sites. It seems unlikely that the conjugate retains<br>
stimulant activity in light of these results. (Marvola, M. (1976). "Effect of acetylated<br>
derivatives of some sympathomimetic amines on the acute toxicity, locomotor<br>
activity and barbiturate anesthesia time in mice." Acta Pharmacol Toxicol (Copenh)<br>
38(5): 474-89).<br>

Example 26: In Vitro Assessment "Kitchen Tests" to Release Amphetamine.<br>
[227] It was anticipated that attempts would be made by illicit chemists to treat the<br>
compound with various easily accessible physical and chemical methods by which<br>
to release free amphetamine from the conjugate. An abuse-resistant preparation<br>
would have the additional feature of not releasing d-amphetamine when exposed to<br>
water, acid (vinegar), base (baking powder and baking soda), and heat. In several<br>
tests with L-lysine-d-amphetamine and GGG-Amp, no amphetamine was detected<br>
after the following treatments:<br><br>
	Vinegar	Tap Water	Baking Powder	Baking Soda<br>
L-Iysine-d-<br>
amphetamine	0%	0%	0%	0%<br>

Samples were heated to boiling for 20-60 minutes in each test.<br>
Example 27. Bioavailability of Various Amino Acid-Amphetamine Compounds<br>
Administered by Oral, Intranasal. and Intravenous Routes.<br>
[228] Oral Administration. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were provided water ad<br>
libitum, fasted overnight, and dosed by oral gavage with amphetamine or amino<br>
acid-amphetamine conjugates containing the equivalent amount of amphetamine.<br>
[229] Intranasal Administration. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were dosed by<br>
intranasal administration with 1.8 mg/kg of amphetamine or lysine-amphetamine<br>
containing the equivalent amount of amphetamine.<br>
[230] The relative in vivo performance of various amino acid-amphetamine<br>
compounds is shown in Figs. 42-50 and summarized in Table 46. Intranasal<br>
bioavailability of amphetamine from Ser-Amp was decreased to some degree<br>
relative to free amphetamine. However, this compound was not bioequivalent with<br>
amphetamine by the oral route of administration. Phenylalanine was bioequivalent<br>
with amphetamine by the oral route of administration, however, little or no decrease<br>
in bioavailability by parenteral routes of administration was observed. Gly3-Amp<br>
had nearly equal bioavailability (90%) by the oral route accompanied by a decrease<br><br>
WO 2005/000334	PCT/US2004/017204<br>

in Cmax {14%). Additionally, Gly3-Amp showed a decrease in bioavailabiiity<br>
relative to amphetamine by intranasal and intravenous routes.<br>

Example 28. Decreased Oral Cmax of d-Amphetamine Conjugates.<br>
[231] Male Sprague-Dawley rats were provided water ad libitum, fasted overnight<br>
and dosed by oral gavage with amphetamine conjugate or d-amphetamine sulfate.<br>
All doses contained equivalent amounts of d-amphetamine base. Plasma d-<br>
amphetamine concentrations were measured by ELISA (Amphetamine Ultra,<br>
109319, Neogen, Corporation, Lexington, KY). The assay is specific for d-<br>
amphetamine with only minimal reactivity (0.6%) of the major d-amphetamine<br>
metabolite (para-hydroxy-d-amphetamine) occurring. Plasma d-amphetamine and L-<br>

amphetamine sulfate into the nasal flares. All doses contained equivalent amounts of<br>
d-amphetamine base. Plasma d-amphetamine concentrations were measured by<br>
ELISA (Amphetamine Ultra, 109319, Neogen, Corporation, Lexington, KY). The<br>
assay is specific for d-amphetamine with only minimal reactivity (0.6%) of the<br>

amphetamine conjugate or d-amphetamine sulfate. All doses contained equivalent<br>
amounts of d-amphetamine base. Plasma d-amphetamine concentrations were<br>
measured by ELISA (Amphetamine Ultra, 109319, Neogen, Corporation, Lexington,<br>

Example 31. Attachment of Amphetamine to Variety of Chemical Moieties<br>
[234] The above examples demonstrate the use of an amphetamine conjugated to a<br>
chemical moiety, such as an amino acid, which is useful in reducing the potential for<br>
overdose while maintaining its therapeutic value. The effectiveness of binding<br>
amphetamine to a chemical moiety was demonstrated through the attachment of<br>
amphetamine to Iysine (K), however, the above examples are meant to be illustrative<br>
only. The attachment of amphetamine to any variety of chemical moieties (i.e.<br>
peptides, glycopeptides, carbohydrates, nucleosides, or vitamins)as described below<br>

[235] Male Sprague-Dawley rats were provided water ad libitum, fasted overnight<br>
and dosed by oral gavage with L-lysine-d-amphetamine or d-amphetamine sulfate.<br>
All doses contained equivalent amounts of d-amphetamine base. As shown in Figs.<br>

appreciable amounts in serum but was not detected in brain tissue indicating that the<br>

[236] A clinical evaluation of the pharmacokinetics and oral bioavaiiability of L-<br>
lysine-d-amphetamine in humans was conducted. L-lysine-d-amphetamine was<br>
orally administered at doses approximating the lower (25 mg) and higher (75 mg)<br>
end of the therapeutic range based on d-amphetamine base content of the doses.<br>
Additionally, the higher dose was compared to doses of Adderall XRÂ® (Shire) or<br>
Dexadrine SpansuleÂ® (GlaxoSmithKline) containing equivalent amphetamine base<br>
to that of the higher L-lysine-d-amphetamine dose. Treatment groups and doses are<br>
summarized in Table 47. All levels below limit quantifiable (blq 
treated as zero for purposes of pharmacokinetic analysis.<br>
[237] The concentrations of d-amphetamine and L-lysine-d-amphetamine intact<br>
conjugate following administration of L-lysine-d-amphetamine at the low and high<br>
dose for each individual subject as well as pharmacokinetic parameters are presented<br>

Adderall XRÂ® or Dexadrine SpansuleÂ® for each individual subject as well as<br>
pharmacokinetic parameters are presented in Tables 52 and 53, respectively.<br>
Concentration-time curves showing L-Iysine-d-amphetamine intact conjugate and d-<br>
amphetamine (ng/mL, Figures 52A and 53A and uM, Figures 52B and 53B) are<br>
presented in Figures 52 and 53. Extended release of d-amphetamine from L-lysine-<br>
d-amphetamine was observed for both doses and pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax<br>
and AUC) were proportional to dose when the lower and higher dose results were<br>
compared (Table 43, 50 and 54; Figures 52 and 53). Significant levels of d-<br>
amphetamine were not observed until one-hour post administration. Only small<br>
amounts (1.6 and 2.0 percent of total drug absorption, respectively for 25 and 75 mg<br>
doses; AUCinf - molar basis) of L-lysine-d-amphetamine intact conjugate were<br>
detected with levels peaking at about one hour Table 49 and 51). The small amount<br>
of intact conjugate absorbed was rapidly and completely eliminated with no<br>
detectable concentrations present by five hours even at the highest dose.<br>
[238] In a cross-over design (identical subjects received Adderall XRÂ® doses<br>
following a 7-day washout period), the higher L-lysine-d-arnphetamine dose was<br>
compared to art equivalent dose of Adderall XRÂ®. Adderall XRÂ® is a once-daily<br>
extended release treatment for ADHD that contains a mixture of d-amphetamine and<br>
l-amphetamine salts (equal amounts of d-amphetamine sulfate, d-/l-amphetamine<br>
sulfate, d-amphetamine saccharate, and d-/l-amphetamine aspartate). An equivalent<br>
dose of extended release Dexadrine SpansuleÂ® (contains extended release<br>
formulation of d-amphetamine sulfate) was also included in the study. As observed<br>
in pharmacokinetic studies in rats, oral administration of L-lysine-d-amphetamine<br>
resulted in d-amphetamine concentration-time curves similar to those of Adderall<br>
XRÂ® and Dexadrine SpansuleÂ® (Figures 54 and 55). The bioavailability (AUCinf) of<br>
d-amphetamine following administration of L-lysine-d-amphetamine was<br>
approximately equivalent to both extended release amphetamine products (Table<br>
54). Over the course of twelve hours, typically the time needed for effective once-<br>
daily treatment of ADHD, the bioavailability for L-lysine-d-amphetamine was<br>
approximately equivalent to that of Adderall XRÂ® (d-amphetamine plus l-<br>
amphetamine levels) and over twenty percent higher than that of Dexadrine<br><br>
WO 2005/000334	PCT/US2004/017204<br>
74<br>
SpansuleÂ®. Based on the results of this clinical study, L-lysine-d-amphetamine<br>
would be an effective once-daily treatment for ADHD. Moreover, L-lysine-d-<br>
amphetamine afforded similar pharmacokinetics in humans and animal models,<br>
namely, delayed release of d-amphetamine resulting in extended release kinetics.<br>
Based on these observations L-lysine-d-amphetamine should also have abuse-<br>
resistant properties in humans.<br><br>

CLAIMS<br>
1.	A compound comprising amphetamine covalently attached to a chemical moiety, selected<br>
from L-lysine-d- amphetamine, a salt thereof and an ester thereof.<br>
2.	The compound according to claim 1, which is L-lysine-d-amphetamine.<br>
3.	The compound according to claim 1, which is a salt or an ester of L-lysme-d-amphetamine.<br>
4.	The compound according to claim 3, which is L-lysine-d-amphetamine mesylate.<br>
5.	The compound according to claim 3, which is L-lysine-d-amphetamine hydrochloride.<br>
6.	The pharmaceutical composition in a form suitable for oral administration, comprising L-<br>
lysine-d-amphetamine or a salt or ester thereof and a pharmaceutically acceptable additive<br><br>
7.	The pharmaceutical composition according to claim 6, consisting essentially of L-lysine-d-<br>
amphetamine or a salt or ester thereof and a pharmaceutically acceptable additive.<br>
8.	The pharmaceutical composition according to claim 6 or 7, wherein said L-lysine-d-<br>
amphetamine salt is L-lysine-d-amphetamine mesylate.<br>
9.	The pharmaceutical composition according to claim 6 or 7, wherein said L-lysine-d-<br>
amphetamine salt is L-lysine-d-amphetamine hydrochloride.<br><br>
10.	The pharmaceutical composition according to any one of claims 6 to 9, wherein said form<br>
suitable for oral administration is selected from the group consisting of a tablet, a capsule, a<br>
caplet, an oral solution, a powder, a granule, a sachet, a syrup, an emulsion and a suspension.<br>
11.	The pharmaceutical composition according to any one of claims 6 to 10, wherein the<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable additive comprises at least one additive selected from the group<br>
consisting of diluents, binders and adhesives, lubricants, plasticizers, disintegrants, colorants,<br>
bulking substances, flavorings, sweeteners, buffers, adsorbents and combinations thereof.<br>
12.	The use of L-lysine-d-amphetamine or of an ester or a salt thereof for preparing a<br>
medicament for the treatment of ADHD.<br>
83<br><br>
13.	The use according to claim 12, characterized in that the salt of L-lysine-d-amphetamine is<br>
selected from L-lysine-d-amphetamine mesylate and L-lysine-d-amphetamine hydrochloride.<br>
14.	The pharmaceutical composition of claim 6, wherein said L-lysine-d-amphetamine or salt<br>
thereof is in an amount sufficient to provide a pharmacologically effective amount to treat a<br>
patient in need of amphetamine.<br>
15.	The pharmaceutical composition of claim 14, wherein said L-lysine-d-amphetamine or salt<br>
thereof is in an amount sufficient to provide a therapeutically bioequivalent AUC when<br>
compared to amphetamine alone, but in an amount insufficient to provide a Cmax which results in<br>
euphoria.<br>
94<br><br><br>
The invention describes compounds compositions and methods or using the some comprising a chemical moiety<br>
covalently attached to amphetamine. These compounds and compositions are useful for reducing or preventing abuse and overdose<br>
of amphetamine. These compounds and compositions find particular use in providing an abuse-resistant alternative treatment for<br>
certain disorders, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), ADD, narcolepsy, and obesity. Oral bioavailability of<br>
amphetamine is maintained at therapeutically useful doses. At higher doses bioavailability is substantially reduced, thereby providing<br>
a method of reducing oral abuse liability. Further, compounds and compositions of the invention decrease the bioavailability of<br>
amphetamine by parenteral routes, such as intravenous or intranasal administration, further limiting their abuse liability.<br></td>
