				<td>Description<br>
Radio network and method for transmitting data in a radio<br>
network<br>
The invention relates to a radio network comprising devices<br>
transmitting data, said devices seizing one of several<br>
available frequency channels for the duration of the data<br>
transmission and comprising a monitoring facility, which also<br>
seizes the used frequency channel during pauses between the<br>
individual data transmissions.<br>
The invention further relates to a method for transmitting<br>
data in a radio network, with devices in the radio network<br>
which transmit data seizing one of several available frequency<br>
channels for the duration of the data transmission and the<br>
used frequency channel also being seized during pauses between<br>
the individual data transmissions.<br>
A radio network and/or a method of this type are known from DE<br>
199 46 540 A1.<br>
In many fields, like for instance in industry, science and<br>
medicine, self-organizing radio networks and networks without<br>
infrastructure, so-called ad-hoc networks, are used<br>
increasingly. A known example of a network of this type is the<br>
wireless local area network (WLAN) according to the IEEE<br>
802.11 standard; Radio links can be established here at any<br>
point between devices (stations), without being dependent upon<br>
fixedly installed base stations or a defined radio network<br>
design. Links from a station to a target station can be<br>
realized in a plurality of possible ways either directly or by<br>
means of relay stations. A limited frequency range with a<br><br>
predetermined number of frequency channels is available for<br>
the communication, of which only a small number can in turn be<br>
used at the same time without any overlap.<br>
To prevent frequency conflict in the case of adjacent or<br>
spatially overlapping radio networks, it is known in the case<br>
of a radio network to be newly formed that by intercepting the<br>
available frequency channels it is determined which of them<br>
are already seized in order on this basis to be able to select<br>
a free frequency channel. Newly activated devices are however<br>
not able to establish the seizure of a frequency band if no<br>
data transmission takes place on this frequency at the time of<br>
its activation.<br>
With the radio network and/or method known from DE 199 46 540<br>
A1 mentioned in the introduction, provision is made for this<br>
reason to additionally seize the used frequency channel during<br>
the pauses between individual data transmissions, for instance<br>
by means of a burst signal, in order to signal the seizure of<br>
the frequency channel to devices in another radio network. In<br>
particular, if data is only transmitted sporadically and/or at<br>
large time intervals, this known type of additional seizure of<br>
the frequency channel is however associated with a relatively<br>
high energy consumption.<br>
To solve this problem, provision is made in accordance with<br>
the invention for the monitoring facility to be embodied in<br>
the case of the radio network of the type cited in the<br>
introduction so as to monitor the seized frequency channel for<br>
an attempted seizure by means of device which does not belong<br>
to the radio network and to perform the additional seizure of<br>
the frequency channel as a function of the detection of such<br>
an attempt.<br><br>
For the method of the type cited in the introduction, the<br>
object is correspondingly achieved such that the seized<br>
frequency channel is monitored for an attempted seizure by<br>
means of a device which does not belong to the radio network<br>
and the additional seizure of the frequency channel takes<br>
place as a function of the detection of such an attempt.<br>
The additional seizure of the frequency channel used for the<br>
data transmission then only takes place if a device which does<br>
not belong to the radio network attempts to seize this<br>
frequency channel and this attempt is detected. The method<br>
according to the invention is thus particularly advantageous<br>
for such radio networks in which data is only transmitted<br>
sporadically and/or at large time intervals.<br>
The additional seizure of the frequency channel by means of<br>
the existing network can take place for instance in that a<br>
sequence of data is sent to an address which is not available<br>
in the existing radio network or that data is transmitted in<br>
the form of broadcasts and these are forwarded by all routers<br>
(relay stations) in the radio network, so that an additional<br>
seizure of the frequency channel is produced as a result.<br>
Furthermore, the transmission power can be increased during<br>
the increase in the seizure. The transmission power can then<br>
also be increased in particular if the attempt to seize the<br>
frequency channel is detected by a third-party device during a<br>
data transmission between the devices in the radio network,<br>
because the original transmission power was not sufficiently<br>
high for instance in order to signalize the seizure of the<br>
frequency channel to the third-party device.<br><br>
The monitoring of the frequency channel of the existing<br>
network can take place in a restricted fashion permanently or<br>
temporally in respect of the pauses between individual data<br>
transmissions if newly activated devices are not able to<br>
determine the seizure of the frequency band. The monitoring of<br>
the frequency channel of the existing network and/or the<br>
increase in the seizure of the frequency channel can take<br>
place by means of all or individual devices of the existing<br>
network or by means of separate devices provided herefor.<br>
To further explain the invention, reference is made below to<br>
the figures in the drawing, in which;<br>
Figure 1 shows a detailed exemplary embodiment of two locally<br>
overlapping radio networks and<br>
Figure 2 shows a detailed example of the course of the method<br>
according to the invention<br>
Figure 1 shows, in a highly diagrammatic manner, first radio<br>
network 1 consisting of devices 11 to 16 which communicate<br>
with one another in a frequency channel x and a second radio<br>
network 2 to be newly formed with the devices 21 to 25.<br>
As shown in Figure 2, the device 16 in the first radio network<br>
1 communicates sporadically in the frequency channel x and<br>
monitors during the pauses therebetween whether a device which<br>
does not belong to network 1 is attempting to seize the<br>
frequency channel x. If the device 22 of the radio network 2<br>
to be newly formed is activated, it attempts to find a free<br>
frequency channel. This can take place such that the device 22<br>
discovers the frequency channel x to be free at this point in<br>
time because no data is currently being transmitted in the<br><br>
existing network 1. However as soon as the device 22 attempts<br>
to seize the frequency channel x, this is detected by the<br>
device 16 in the first network, which consequently performs an<br>
additional seizure of the frequency channel x by transmitting<br>
a sequence of data. This is in turn identified by the device<br>
22, which consequently switches to another frequency channel<br>
y.<br>
The facility 26, 26', which contains the functionality of<br>
monitoring the frequency channel x of the existing network 1<br>
and the functionality of the additional seizure of the<br>
frequency channel x, may include all or individual devices in<br>
the existing network 1 or separate devices provided as extra<br>
herefor. For instance an attempted third-party seizure of the<br>
used frequency channel z by the active devices in each<br>
instance, e.g. 16, of the network 1, can be detected and<br>
notified to a separate device 27, which then performs the<br>
additional seizure of the frequency channel x.<br><br>
