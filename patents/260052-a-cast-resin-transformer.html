Description<br><br>
Transformer with electrical shield<br>
The invention relate to a transformer, in particular a cast-resin transformer, having at least one lower voltage winding and at least one upper voltage winding.<br>
When producing a transformer, in particular a cast-resin transformer, and subsequently installing, it in very different environments, a very wide variety of safety aspects need to be taken into consideration. Owing to the voltages used in the medium-voltage and high-voltage range, it is absolutely necessary to prevent the outer casing; of the transformer from being touched. For this reason, the transformers are protected by external covers or protective walls.<br>
Furthermore, only electrical shields between the primary winding and the lower voltage winding of the transformer are known from the prior art. This shielding reduces the capacitive and/or inductive coupling of the windings to one another and reduces the coupling impedance at higher frequencies. For example, DE 41 2 3 812 A1 describes a transformer having at least one primary winding and at least one lower voltage winding, a shield being arranged between the primary winding and the lower voltage finding, which shield is connected to the ground of the transformer via a nonreacti.ve resistor. This therefore likewise results in the reduction of undesired stray inductances and/or stray impedances in the transformer windings.<br>
DE 89 14 262.4 01 describes a transformer with shielding windings between the primary winding and the lower voltage winding. In this case, a shield is selected as an insulated,<br><br>
electrically unclosed winding consisting of a magnetizable material. In order to avoid a short circuit in the electrical shield, no closed winding should be provided.<br>
One disadvantage with all the previous transformers, in particular cast-resin itransformers, from the prior art is the need for a complex protective housing or outer protection around the transformer when it is installed outdoors. A protective housing is . likewise necessary when installing the transformer in climatically unfavorable or severely contaminated environments. In cast-resin transformers, this protective housing is also required for preventing a person from touching the transformer. In order to avoid a voltage flashover, the distance between the outer protective housing and the outside of the transformer needs to be selected to be sufficiently great according to the prior art. Owing to this disadvantage, it is necessary to provide larger actuating faces than is necessary for the operation of a transformer.<br>
The object of the present invention is therefore to provide a compact transformer which is easy to produce and has protection against electric shock.<br>
According to the invention, the object is achieved by virtue of the fact that an electrical shield is arranged around the upper voltage winding. The upper voltage winding is in particular a medium-voltage or high-voltage winding. As a result, the voltage potential between the coil surface and the upper voltage winding, whicih may be carrying a high voltage, is advantageously set to zero, and therefore a voltage flashover is prevented even in the event of touching contact by a person. Advantageously, the electrical shield surrounds the<br><br>
upper voltage winding virtually completely apart from the incoming and outgoing electrical lines.	<br>
In an advantageous configuration of the transformer, the electrical shield is connected to the electrical ground and is therefore grounded. Owing to the grounding of the electrical shield, the risk of a person touching jthe electrical shield is minimized or prevented. Advantageously, the electrical shield coaxially surrounds the cylindrical upper voltage winding, the electrical shield being interrupted in the radial direction, and the interspace thus produced insulating the ends of the electrical shield i.n the radial direction with respect to one another. In this case, the ends of the shield need to overlap one another. This advantageous configuration of the electrical shield prevents short-circuit currents within the electrical shield. In the interspace, in addition insulation may prevent<br>
an electrical connection between the thus created ends of the<br>
electrical shield. Advantageously, the ends of the electrical shield overlap one another in order to ensure complete shielding. In the region of overlap, insulation, ideally a thin insulating film, can be introduced so as to avoid short-circuit currents.<br>
In an advantageous configuration of the transformer, the electrical shield is an electrically conductive material, such as a braided wire, for example, and therefore represents a Faraday cage. The transformer is preferably configured in such a way that the distance of the interspace between the electrical shield and the upper voltage winding is selected such that, depending on the dielectric located in the interspace between the electrical shield and the primary winding, protection against a voltage <br><br>
breakdown is provided. In the event of the transformer being cast with cast resin, the distance of the shield from the upper voltage winding is to be selected such that a vol tagc breakdown via the cast resin located in the interspace is ruled out. This distance should be selected in a similar manner for other insulation materials. <br>
In order to ensure the installation of a cast-resin transformer which has been possible to date in climatically unfavorable environments or environments which are susceptible to contamination for the transformer according to the invention as well, the electrical shield needs to be protected against external contact influences. In the simplest case, this can be ensured by an outer plate. Likewise, casting of a transformer with cast resin, a so-called "casting", provides the possibility of the casting surrounding the electrical shield and of a distance remaining between the outer wall of the casting and the electrical shield. Owing, to the fact that the upper voltage winding and, the electrical shield are cast jointly, partial discharges are substantially reduced since the interspace between the upper voltage winding and the shield is not filled with air. At the same time, the joint casting increases the dimensional, stability of the electrical shield and ensures a constant distance between the upper voltage winding and the electrical shield.<br>
In an alternative configuration, the upper voltage winding with the electrical shield and the lower voltage winding are cast jointly with cast resin. As a result a very compact design of the transformer is possible and, at the same time, a dimensionally stable and positionally stable electrical shield around the upper voltage winding is ensured.<br><br>
In one advantageous configuration, the transformer has at least one guide for the electrical connections, which are located in the interior of the transformer, of the upper voltage winding and/or of the lower voltage winding, the guide being connected to a bushing arranged on the outer wall of the transformer. Owing to this electrical shielding on all sides and grounding of the outer transformer casing, complete electrical shielding and therefore protection against electric shock for people is provided. Furthermore, this provides the possibility provided for cast-resin transformers of an installation of the transformer in climatically unfavorable environments or environments which are susceptible to contamination for the transformer according to the invention as well. Advantageously, the bushing and/or the fixing flange are connected to the electrical shield and therefore to ground.<br>
Advantageously, the transformer comprises at Least two castings, an upper voltage winding with shield and a lower voltage winding being cast together in each casting. The castings thus produced are arranged around a common core, the upper voltage windings and/or the respective electrical shields and/or the lower voltage windings in each case being interconnected by means of plugs/connectors and high-voltage cables. Owing to the use of plugs, a rapid connection of the windings is provided. <br>
Advantageously, the transformer designed in this way is cooled by an air-cooling and/or water-cooling system in the interspace between the upper voltage winding and the lower voltage winding. In order to assist the circulation of heat and therefore the transport of heat within the cooling channels, fans are arranged in a suitable manner. In particular, in the case of a<br><br>
horizontal arrangement of the transformer according to the invention with an air-cooling system, the fan prevents an accumulation of heat within the cooling channels and therefore damage to the transformer. Alternatively, in the case of an air-cooling and/or liquid-cooling system, the use of an external heat exchange device is possible. This configuration according to the invention is primarily suitable in the case of installation on ships.<br>
Further embodiments according to the invention can be found in<br>
the dependent claims. The invention will be explained in more<br><br>
detail with reference to the following accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows a perspective, partially sectional drawing of the transformer according to the invention with two<br><br>
shielded upper voltage and lower voltage windings according to the invention;<br>
Figure 2 shows a sectional drawing along the line 1-] in figure 1;<br>
Figure 3 shows a perspective, partially sectional drawing of the transformer according to the invention with a shielded upper voltage winding according to the invention and a lower voltage winding.<br>
Figure 1 shows a perspective, partially sectional drawing of the transformer 1 according ! to the invention with two electrically connected upper voltage windings 3a, 3b and two lower voltage windings 2a, 2b, the upper voltage windings 3a, 3b coaxially surrounding the lower voltage windings 2a, 2b. The lower voltage windings 2a, 2b each have electrical connections 9, a guide 8 making it possible to connect the electrical connections 9 outside of the<br><br>
transformer 1 by means of a bushing 10. An electrical : shield 4a, 4b, which is connected to the electrical ground 11, is arranged around the upper voltage winding 3a, 3b. The electrical shield 4a, 4b in this case surrounds the upper voltage windings 3a, 3b in each case virtually completely in the axial direction. In the partial, drawing, no bushing 10 is illustrated for reasons of clarity. <br>
Figure 2 is a sectional drawing through the perspective<br>
illustration of figure 1 along the line I-I . The lower voltage<br>
windings 2a, 2b are connected to the bushing 10, such as<br>
produced by the company Elastimold®, located on the outer wall<br>
of the transformer 1 via electrical connections 9 within the<br>
guide 8. In the example illustrated, the bushing 10 is arranged<br>
on the outer wall of the transformer 1, in the present example<br>
this being the electrical shield 4a, 4b. As a result, the<br>
fixing flange 10 is electrically connected to the electrical<br>
shield 4a, 4b and electrically grounded by the electrical<br>
connection to ground 11. The distance 5 between the lower<br>
voltage windings 2a, 2b and the upper voltage windings 3a, 3b<br>
can be used as a cooling channel. It is also possible for the<br>
partial segments of the transformer 1 to be cast individually<br>
and for these so-called castings, comprising in each case one<br>
upper voltage winding 3a, lower voltage winding 2a and the<br>
electrical shield 4a, to be dimensioned such that the outer <br>
wall of this casting goes beyond the electrical shield 4 a in <br>
the axial direction. This distance should be selected in such a<br>
way that a voltage flashover from the electrical shield 4a to<br>
the outer wall of the casting (not illustrated here) is<br><br>
ensured.		<br><br>
Furthermore, a transformer 1 designed according to the invention, despite the embodiments of the lines on the outside of the transformer 1 according to the invention, makes it possible for cast-resin transformers to be installed in climatically unfavorable environments or environments which are susceptible to contamination. Owing to the use of bushings 10 protected on both sides on the outer wall of the transformer 1, the possible ingress of dirt is suppressed.<br>
Figure 3 shows a perspective, partially sectional drawing of the transformer 1 according to the invention with an electrically shielded upper voltage winding 3a and a lower voltage winding 2a, the upper voltage winding 3a coaxially surrounding the lower voltage winding 2a. The electrical shield 4a in the form of a braided wire is only indicated as a dashed line. The upper voltage winding 3a is almost completely surrounded by the electrical shield 4a and cast jointly with cast resin. At the same time, the lower voltage winding 2b, only indicated schematically, is likewise cast with the electrically shielded upper voltage winding 2a. This allows for a very compact design of the transformer according to the invention. Cooling channels are formed in the casting between the shielded upper voltage winding 2a and the lower voltage winding 2b, these interspaces being formed by suitable rod-shaped elements during the casting process. The arrangement, shape and size of the interspaces 5 need to be matched to the respective requirements, such as the expected thermal loading or the thermal capacity of the cooling medium, for example.<br><br>
