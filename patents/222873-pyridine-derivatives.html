Detailed description of the invention<br>
The compounds of the invention can be prepared from corresponding phenol<br>
derivatives (IV), wherein R2, R3, X, Z and Y are the same as defined above.<br><br>
The syntheses are shown in Scheme 1, wherein formula (IV) is abbreviated as<br>
Ar-OH (IV). Pyridin-2-yloxy derivatives (1) are obtained by reactions with a suitable<br>
halopyridines (2) where R1 can be hydrogen, nitro, cyano, halogen, or amide and X1<br>
chlorine or bromine. The nitropyridine and nicotinamide derivatives can be reduced<br>
to corresponding amines (3) and (4), respectively.<br><br><br>
The reaction of 2-chloro-5-chlorome1hylpyridine (5) with diemethylamine<br>
results in (6-chloropyridin-3-ylmethyl)dimethylamine (6), which in turn can be<br>
reacted with phenol derivatives (IV), as shown in Scheme 2.<br><br>
Nicotinic acid derivatives (12) and their esters (11) are obtained as shown in<br>
Scheme 3. The esterification of 6-chloronicotinic acid and its reaction with phenol<br>
derivatives (IV) gives nicotinic acid ester derivatives (11) (R can be lower alkyl).<br>
Nicotinic acid derivatives (12) are obtained upon hydrolysis.<br><br>
The aminopyridine derivatives (3) are reacted with suitable amino acids and<br>
other carboxylic acid derivatives using 1-(dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylacarbodi-<br>
imide hydrochloride as an coupling agent to result in amide derivatives (13) as shown<br>
in the following Scheme 4 wherein R5 is as defined above. Optionally the amide<br><br>
derivatives of (13) can be obtained by well-known acylation methods. Protecting<br>
groups are removed if needed.<br><br>
4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-ylmethyl)benzoic acid (17) is obtained as described in<br>
the following Scheme 5. 4-Chloromethylbenzoic acid (14) is first esterified to a<br>
methyl ester to protect an acid group in the following reaction. 4-Chloromethyl-<br>
benzoic acid methyl ester (15) is then allowed to react with 1-methylpiperazine to<br>
give 4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yhnethyl)benzoic acid methyl ester (16). Methyl ester is<br>
cleaved by heating with potassium hydroxide in methanol. 4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-<br>
ylmethyl)benzoic acid is reacted as described above in Scheme 4 with aminopyridine<br>
derivatives (3) to result in N-4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-ylmethyl)benzamide derivatives<br>
of (13). By a similar manner other N-4-(piperazin-1-ylmethyl)benzamide derivatives<br>
of (13) can be prepared.<br><br>
The 2-chloroacetamide derivatives (13') where R5 is CH2C1 are reacted with<br>
sodium azide to result in azide derivatives (18) which in turn are reduced to corres-<br>
ponding 2-aminoacetamide derivatives (19) as shown in the following Scheme 6<br>
wherein R7 and R8 are as defined above. The acetamide derivatives (20) are obtained<br>
from 2-chloroacetamide derivatives (13') by reaction with various amines. The amide<br>
moiety of acetamide derivatives (20) can be reduced in order to result in<br>
corresponding amines (21).<br><br>
As shown in the following Scheme 7, wherein R2 and R3 are the same as<br>
defined above, 6- and 7-hydroxyflavane derivatives (23) are obtained from corres-<br>
ponding fiavanones (22) by Clemmensen reduction. 6- and 7-hydroxyflavanones (22)<br>
are commercially available or can be synthesised by methods described in the litera-<br>
ture, e.g. J. Org Chem., 1960,25,1247-9 and J. Org. Chem., 1958, 23, 1159-61 or as<br>
described later in Scheme 9.<br><br><br>
The following Scheme 8, wherein R2 and R3 are the same as defined above,<br>
describes the synthesis of 2-phenyl indan-5-ols (30). Condensation of p-anisaldehyde<br>
(24) with substituted phenyl acetic acid (25) gives mixture of cis-and trans-isomers<br>
of the corresponding acrylic acid (26). After hydrogenation and intramolecular<br>
Friedel-Crafts reaction carbonyl functionality of 1-indanones (28) can be reduced by<br>
Clemmensen reduction. Finally methoxy indane (29) is refluxed in concentrated<br>
hydrobromic acid to obtain 2-phenyl indan-5-ols (30).<br><br><br>
6-Hydroxyflavanone derivatives can be synthesised as shown in Scheme 9<br>
wherein R2, R3 and R12 are as defined above. 2',5'-Dihydroxyacetophenone or<br>
corresponding propiophenone (32) is condensed with appropriate benzaldehyde (31)<br>
resulting in a mixture of desired 6-hydroxyflavanone (34) and the corresponding<br>
chalcone (35). The chalcone can be cyclised to flavanone.<br><br>
The benzaldehyde derivatives of (31) wherein R2 and R3 can contain pyridine<br>
moiety are obtained by the reaction of hydroxybenzaldehydes (35) with pyridine<br>
derivatives (36) (where X1 can be chlorine or bromine and R' hydrogen, nitro or<br>
halogen) as shown in Scheme 10.<br><br>
2-Phenylchroman-4,6-diol derivatives (39) are obtained from corresponding<br>
6-hydroxyflavanones (38) by reduction as shown in Scheme 11 wherein R2, R3 and<br><br>
R12 are as defined above. These diol derivatives can be reduced further into 6-<br>
hydroxyflavanes (40).<br><br>
The following Scheme 12, wherein R2 and R3 are the same as defined above,<br>
describes the synthesis of 7-hydroxyisoflavones (45) and 7-hydroxyisoflavans (46),<br>
Acylation of 3-methoxyphenol (41) with substituted phenyl acetic acids (42) gives<br>
the corresponding 2-hydroxydeoxybenzoins (43) which can be cyclised with triethyl-<br>
orthoformate to yield isoflavones (44). Deprotection with hydrobromic acid and<br>
catalytic hydrogenation gives 7-hydroxyisoflavans (46).<br><br><br>
The following Scheme 13 describes the synthesis of 2-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-<br>
benzo[1,4]oxathiin-6-ol (50). The reaction of 2-mercaptobenzene-1,4-diol (47) with<br>
styrene epoxide (48) in the presence of base gives sulphide (49). The ring closure<br>
with an acid ion exchanger affords 2-phenyl-2,3-dihydrobenzo[1,4]oxathiin-6-ol<br>
(50).<br><br><br>
The following Scheme 14 describes the synthesis of 6-phenyl-5,6,7,8-tetra-<br>
hydro-naphthalen-2-ol (55) and 6-hydroxy-2-phenyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-naphthalen-1-<br>
one (54). Palladium catalyzed á-arylation of 6-methoxy-1-tetralone (51) gives 6-<br>
methoxy-2-phenyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-naphthalen-1-one (53) which after demethylation<br>
leads to the phenolic compound (54). Reduction with triethylsilane gives 6-phenyl-<br>
5,6,7,8-tetrahydronaphthalen-2-ol (55).<br><br><br>
The following Scheme 15, wherein R2 and R3 are as defined above and R" is<br>
an appropriate protecting group, describes the synthesis of 2,3-dihydro-2-phenyl-<br>
benzo[l,4]dioxin-6-ols (60). After the protecting hydroxyl groups of 2,5-dihydroxy-<br>
acetophenone are removed, this ketone rearranges with peracids and gives a phenol<br>
(56) after hydrolysis. The phenol (56) is condensed with a haloketone and after<br>
reduction and removal of protection groups the hydroxyphenol (59) is cyclised to a<br>
2,3-dihydro-2-phenyl-benzo[1,4]-dioxin-6-ol (60).<br><br><br>
Dihydroxyflavane derivatives (61) can be reacted with pyridine derivatives in<br>
a similar manner as described for compound (1) in Scheme 1. 4-Chromanol<br>
derivative of (62), where R* is OH, can be reduced to corresponding flavane with<br>
triethylsilane in acidic media. 5-nitropyridine derivatives (62) are reduced to corres-<br>
ponding 2-aminoderivatives (63), which in turn can be acylated or mesylated or<br>
reacted with various aminoacid- or carboxylic acid derivatives as described in<br>
Scheme 4 for compound (13).<br><br><br>
When the nitro group in the benzyloxy derivatives (65) is reduced by<br>
hydrogenation using palladium as catalyst there are obtained [6-(5-aminopyridin-2-<br>
yloxy)chroman-2-yl]phenol derivatives (68) which in turn can be acylated or<br>
mesylated. These phenol derivatives (69) can then be reacted with pyridine<br>
derivatives (2) to result in derivatives like (70) as shown in the following Scheme 17.<br>
The reduction with zinc leads to amines like (66) which in turn can be acylated,<br>
mesylated or reacted with various amino acid- or carboxylic acid derivatives as<br>
described in Scheme 4 for compound (13).<br><br>
Alkyl derivatives of aminopyridines (3) can be obtained by reductive<br>
amination as shown in Scheme 18 for dimethylamine derivatives (71). In the course<br>
of the reaction the amine moiety is partially rearranged from 5 to 4 position.<br><br><br>
The following Scheme 19, describes the synthesis of l-methyl-3-<br>
(pyridinyl)thiourea (73) and N-methyl-N-(pyridynyl)guanidine (74) derivatives.<br>
Aminopyridine derivatives (3) were reacted with methyl isothiocyanate to result in<br>
tioura derivatives (73), which in turn were treated first with methyl iodide and then<br>
with methanolic solution of ammonia in order to obtain guanidine derivatives (74).<br><br>
Salts and esters of the compounds, when applicable, may be prepared by<br>
known methods. Physiologically acceptable salts are useful as active medicaments.<br>
Examples are the salts with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic<br>
acid or nitric acid, and salts with organic acids such as methanesulfonic acid, citric<br>
acid or tartaric acid. Physiologically acceptable esters are also useful as active<br>
medicaments. Examples are the esters with aliphatic or aromatic acids such as acetic<br>
acid or with aliphatic or aromatic alcohols such as ethanol.<br>

Inhibition of ouabain-induced arrhythmias<br>
Ouabain by blocking of sodium-potassium ATPase increases intracellular<br>
sodium which is changed for calcium via NCX. Increased intracellular calcium is<br>
leading to overload of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and spontaneous calcium release<br>
from SR inducing delayed afterpolarizations (DADs). Equivalence for DADs in force<br>
signal is aftercontractions (ACs) which are seen as spontaneous twitches after the<br>
pacing controlled twitch.<br>
The antiarrhythmic effects of the title compounds of Examples 13, 33, 14a<br>
and 14b were examined. The results are shown in Figures 1 to 3. Figure 1 shows the<br>
effects of the compounds on the start time of fast rise of ouabain-induced after-<br>
contractions. Figure 2 shows the effects of the compounds on the maximum heights<br>
of ouabain-induced aftercontractions in guinea-pig papillary muscles. Figure 3 shows<br>
the effects of the compounds on the time to maximum heights of ouabain-induced<br>
aftercontractions in guinea-pig papillary muscles.<br>
In general, the compounds of the invention delayed appearance and decreased<br>
the amplitude of aftercontractions. The title compound of Example 33, at 10 µM<br>
concentration, was able to inhibit completely the emergency of ouabain-induced<br>
second aftercontraction.<br>
