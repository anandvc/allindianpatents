				<td>CONDENSATE REMOVAL SYSTEM ROOFTOP AIR CONDITIONER<br>
Cross Reference to Related Applications<br>
[0001]	This application is related to the following pending applications being<br>
concurrently filed herewith and assigned to the assignee of the present invention:<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
10002]	This invention relates to a low profile air conditioning unit for<br>
installation upon the roof of a vehicle and, in particular, upon the rooftop of a passenger bus.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0003]	Rooftop air conditioners have been installed upon buses and the like<br>
for a number of years. Typically, both the condenser and the evaporator sections of the unit are mounted outside the passenger compartment of the vehicle upon the roof. Conditioned air from the unit is passed into the vehicle through an opening in the roof and return air is passed back into the unit through a second roof opening. The compressor servicing the unit is generally located in the engine compartment of the vehicle and is driven directly from the engine. Refrigerant lines are passed back<br>
from the engine compartment to the rooftop unit through the interior of the vehicle.<br>
These interior lines can pose a constant danger due to the lines leaking or sweating.<br>
[0004]	In U.S. Patent 4,870,833 there is disclosed a rooftop air conditioning<br>
unit for a motor vehicle that utilizes an electrical driven compressor that is contained along with an inverter in the rooftop unit. Power to the unit is provided by a generator that is driven directly from the engine of the vehicle. In this arrangement the refrigerant lines passing between the engine compartment and the air conditioning unit are eliminated thus avoiding any danger of the lines leaking or sweating inside the vehicle. However, the removal of condensate from the rooftop unit itself still poses a problem.<br>
[0005]	A window air conditioner is described in U.S. Patent 5,337,580 in<br>
which an axial flow condenser fan is mounted with the condenser coil and the compressor in the outdoor section of the unit. The evaporator coil is contained in the indoor section of the unit. A cone shaped condensate slinger is connected to the condenser fan motor and is arranged to throw condensate generated by the indoor evaporate coil against the outdoor condenser coil. A portion of the condensate that contacts the heated surfaces of the condenser coil is evaporated to improve the efficiency of the unit. The remaining condensate is collected in the condenser pan and is permitted to drain as moisture to the outdoors discharges from the unit as a vapor in the cooling air stream.<br>
[0006]	Many rooftop air conditioning units that are mounted on buses or<br>
recreational vehicles simple drain the condensate from the evaporator over the roof of the vehicle or multiple drain lines requiring costly installation and maintenance. The moisture, over a period of time forms an unsightly stain on the vehicles finish and films the window surfaces reducing the drivers visibility and thus posing a potential hazard. Attempts to incorporate more effective condensate removal systems for these types of roof top units invariably produce an increase in the height of the unit which, in turn, increase the amount of drag acting on the vehicle as it moves through the air.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br><br>
[0007]	It is a primary object of the present invention to improve rooftop air<br>
conditioning units for vehicles and, in particular, for buses, recreational vehicles and<br>
the like.<br>
[0008]	It is a further object of the present invention to more efficiently<br>
remove condensate from a rooftop air conditioning unit of a motor vehicle.<br>
[0009]	Another object of the present invention is to provide an effective way<br>
of removing condensate from a rooftop air conditioning unit that contains multiple<br>
evaporator coils and condenser coils.<br>
[0010]	A still further object of the present invention is to provide an efficient<br>
condensate removal system for a rooftop air conditioning unit for a bus or the like<br>
without having to increase the height and size of the unit.<br>
[0011]	Yet another object of the present invention is to remove condensate<br>
from the rooftop air conditioning unit of a bus in a clean and an aesthetically<br>
pleasing manor.<br>
[0012]	Yet another object is to eliminate installation and maintenance of<br>
condensate hoses and connections.<br>
[0013]	These and other objects of the present invention are provided by a<br>
rooftop air conditioning unit that includes multiple evaporator coils and condenser<br>
coils. An enclosure is mounted adjacent to the evaporator section of the unit that<br>
contains a pair of vertical side walls and a pair of opposed condenser coils that form<br>
the end walls of the enclosure. The enclosure further includes a bottom wall and a<br>
top wall that has an opening for housing a condenser fan. The fan is connected to<br>
the drive shaft of a fan motor which is suspended inside the enclosure. The drive<br>
shaft of the motor is aligned along the central axis of the enclosure and a slinger dish<br>
is mounted beneath the motor and is secured to the shaft. The bottom wall of the<br>
enclosure slopes inwardly for the side wall and end walls of the enclosure toward the<br>
central axis of the enclosure. Condensate generated by the evaporator coils is<br>
conducted into the enclosure and collects in the center of the enclosure beneath the<br>
slinger dish. The slinger dish opens upwardly towards the motor and contains a<br>
suction port for the drawing condensate collected in the center of the enclosure into<br>
the dish. A series of distribution ports direct the condensate over the inside surface<br><br>
of the dish and the condensate is then broadcast outwardly over the surfaces of the two condenser coils. The condenser coil are placed at an acute angle with regard to the central axis of the enclosure to considerable reduce the height of the unit. Preferably, each coil forms an angle of between 40° and 50° with the central axis of the enclosure.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawing<br>
[0014]	For a further understanding of these and objects of the present<br>
invention, reference will be made to the following detailed description of the<br>
invention which is to be read in association with the drawings, wherein:<br>
[0015]	FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a bus that includes a rooftop air<br>
conditioning unit that encompasses the teachings of the present invention;<br>
[0016]	FIG. 2 is an enlarged perspective view of the air conditioning unit<br>
with the cover removed and parts broken away to more clearly show the internal<br>
components of the unit;<br>
[0017]	FIG. 3 is a partial side elevation of the condenser section of the air<br>
conditioning unit;<br>
[0018]	FIG. 4 is an enlarged perspective view of the slinger dish used in the<br>
practice of the invention for distributing condensate upon the heat exchanger surface<br>
of the two condenser coils; and<br>
[0019]	FIG. 5 is a sectional view taken along line 5-5 in Fig. 3.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
[0020]	Turning initially to Fig. 1, there is shown a motorized bus that is<br>
generally references 10. The bus engine 11 is mounted in the rear of the vehicle in its own motor compartment. An air conditioning unit 13 is mounted upon the roof 14 of the bus and is arranged to provide conditioned air to the passenger compartment of the vehicle. The air conditioning unit is housed within a low profile cover 15 that is designed to reduce air resistance as the bus moves in a forward direction. A pair of openings 16 and 17 are provided in the top surface of the cover over the two condenser coils 18 and 19 of the unit. A circular opening 20 is also<br><br>
provided in the cover between openings 16 and 17 directly over the condenser fan<br>
21. Outside air is drawn into the fan and is passed through the condenser coils to<br>
cool the coil heat exchanger surfaces before being exhausted upwardly by the fan 21.<br>
[0021]	As will be explained below, the present unit contains an electrically<br>
driven refrigerant compressor and an inverter for providing regulated current to the compressor and other electrical components of the unit including the condenser and evaporator fans. An electrical generator 24 is mounted in the motor compartment of the vehicle and is driven directly off the engine 11. The generator provides the necessary electrical input to the unit via electrical lines 25 that pass along the inside of the bus roof.<br>
[0022]	With further reference to Figs. 2 and 3 there is illustrated the internal<br>
components of the rooftop unit. The unit contains three main sections that include an evaporator section 27, a condenser section 28 and a compressor and alternator section 29. The evaporator section 27 contains two opposed evaporator coils 30 and 31 that are inclined inwardly at an angle at either end of the support frame 33 of the unit. Each evaporator coil is serviced by its own evaporator fan 35 that is suspended from a cross member 37 supported in the top of the frame. Each evaporator fan is arranged to draw return air from the passenger compartment through a ceiling opening 38 and direct the return air over a companion evaporator coil via an air duct 39. The air is conditioned as it passes over the heat exchanger surfaces of the coil and is delivered back into the passenger compartment via a supply air opening (not shown) in the ceiling of the bus.<br>
[0023]	The condenser section 28 of the air conditioning unit is mounted<br>
upon the unit frame 33 immediately adjacent to the evaporator section 28. The condenser section includes an enclosure generally referenced 40 that houses the components of the condenser section. The enclosure includes a pair of opposed vertical side walls, one of which is denoted at 41, and two opposed end walls that formed by the previously noted condenser coils 18 and 19. The enclosure also includes a top wall 42 and a bottom wall 43. A circular opening is provided in the top wall of the enclosure and is axially aligned with the central vertically disposed axis 50 of the enclosure. A single condenser fan 21 is connected to the drive shaft<br><br>
51 of an electrical motor 52 that is suspended inside the enclosure by any well known, suitable means. The motor and the drive shaft are both coaxially aligned along the vertical axis 50 of the housing.<br>
[0024]	The bottom wall 43 of the housing is inclined inwardly from side<br>
walls and end walls of the enclosure to create a low section or recess 55 in the floor directly under the condenser fan.<br>
[0025]	As illustrated in Fig. 5, a channel 60 is located between the<br>
evaporator section of the housing and the condenser section. Condensate generated by the two evaporator coils is gravity fed into the channel through a suitable outlet port or, alternatively, a tube or the like leading from each evaporator section. The channel, in rum, is arranged to gravity feed the condensate to at least one inlet port 62 in side wall 41 of the condenser enclosure. The condensate is then conducted by the inclined floor of the enclosure to the recessed collection area 55 located beneath the condenser motor.<br>
[0026]	The drive shaft of the condenser fan passes through the motor casing<br>
and extends downwardly from the bottom of the motor. A concave shaped slinger<br>
dish 65 (Fig. 4) is mounted upon the lower section of the drive shaft so that the dish<br>
«<br>
can communicate with the condensate that is maintained within the collection area<br>
55. As illustrated in Fig. 3, the dish is mounted on the motor shaft so that the dish<br>
opens upwardly towards the motor. A cylindrical mounting hub 67 is centrally<br>
located inside the dish and is integral with the dish. A central bore 68 passes<br>
through the hub and the motor drive shaft passes partially down into the bore. The<br>
shaft is locked to hub by a set screw 69 so that the dish turns with the motor shaft.<br>
The bottom section of the bore communicates with a suction port 70 that opens<br>
upwardly through the dish from the collecting region of the enclosure floor. A series<br>
of distribution ports 71 are circumferentially spaced around the bottom portion of the<br>
flange and are arranged to pass into the lower bore opening.<br>
[0027]	In operation, the dish is arranged to turn with the condenser fan at a<br>
relatively high speed which is sufficiently high enough to cause condensate in the collection area to be drawn into the bore of the flange through the suction port. The condensate in the bore is discharged from the flange through the distribution ports so<br><br>
that it contacts the inner surface of the dish. The spinning dish creates a relatively large centrifugal force that acts to drive the condensate outwardly from the dish surface and the condensate is broadcasted over the heat exchanger surfaces of the two condenser coils. The condensate is at least partially evaporated upon the two condenser coils and is carried out of the unit in the form of a vapor. The condensate that is not evaporated drops to the floor of the enclosure and is returned to the center collection region of the enclosure under the influence of gravity and is re-broadcasted over the condenser coils so that eventually all of the condensate passes out of the unit in the form of a vapor.<br>
[0028]	An electrically driven compressor 80 is mounted in the compressor<br>
and alternator section of the unit within a common housing along with a inverter 81.<br>
As noted, the inverter is arranged to receive power from the generator and to<br>
provide a regulated output to the compressor and the evaporator and condenser fans.<br>
[0029]	While the present invention has been particularly shown and<br>
described with reference to the preferred mode as illustrated in the drawing, it will be understood by one skilled in the art that various changes in detail maybe effected therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the claims.<br><br><br><br><br>
