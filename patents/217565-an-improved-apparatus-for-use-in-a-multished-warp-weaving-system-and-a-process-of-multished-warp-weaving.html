				<td>This invention relates to an improved apparatus for use in a multisheci warp weaving system and a process thereof,<br>
Multished warp weaving systems are known in the prior art, one of the multisheci warp weaving system is called as weft way system in which a multiplicity of sheds move in the warp direction along a flat path. The pther system is called as curved warp wave system or rotor systems in which a multiplicity of sheds is moved in the warp direction along a covered path. The third system is known as flat warp way system wherein a multiplteitp of sheds are formed by conventional healds and j these sheds moved in the warp direction along a flat<br>
There are certain disadvantages associated with all these \ conventional weaving systems/devices. One of the main disadvantage is that none of these conventional systems gives higher productivity as compared to single phase looms of the air jet type, due to the reason that sheds are formed one by one (though a number of them exist in any given time) rather than a number of them formed in a batch. As these sheds are formed one after another the speed of the process cannot be faster that the speed of shedding which by itself cannot be very high due to the reciprocating nature of this operation.<br>
Another  disadvantage  is that a  small  weft carriers have to move in unison with slowly moved  sheds and therefore reduces the productivity.<br>
Another  disadvantage is that the  sheds  are formed  one  after another and therefore  the  speed  of shedding  is  low and hence the productivity  cannot  he faster than the frequency of the same.<br>
Yet  another disadvantage is that  the  cloth produced  is skewed i.e. the warp and weft yarn are  not at 90 °angle.<br>
Still  another  disadvantage is that  of  the incorporation  of complicated weft rewinding  system on the weaving system  which reduces the speed of the loom.<br>
/'"'<br>
Yet another disadvantage is that the lamellar elements  employed  in  the  weaving  system  for   shed formation causes excessive  warp to rotor friction.<br>
Another disadvantage is that the weft  supply packages and picking remain attached to the shed  during its  transfer  to the fell to the cloth  and  thereby  a large  number of these systems are required though  only some of them are working at a time.<br>
Still   another   disadvantage  is   that   a complicated folding  and unfolding lamellar structure is provided  with  the looms and which acts as a  type  for weft propulsion and retains the sheds during transit  is required in the system.<br>
Another  disadvantage  is  that  weft  supply package  and weft supply system have to travel with  the trave 11 incj sheds.<br>
Therefore  the  main object  of  the  present invention  is  to  provide an apparatus  for  use  in  a multished   warp   weaving  system   to   increase   the productivity thereof.<br>
Another  object  of  this  invention  is   to provide  an improved weaving system which  obviates  the disadvantages associated with the  prior art.<br>
Another  object  of  this  invention  is   to provide a weaving system having the means to  facilitate the  movement  of  the weft supply  and  picking  system alongwith the sheds smoothly.<br>
A  further  object of this  invention  is  to provide an improved process to minimise the harsh action of shed forming elements on warp.<br>
Another  object  of  this  invention  is   to provide  an  improved  process wherein equal  number  of picks  are  simultaneously inserted through  the  formed sheds.<br>
According to this invention there is provided an improved apparatus for use in a multished warp weaving system characterised in that is plurality of rolling bars connected with each other by means of a arcular links to form a pressure bar chain, sprockets being provided at one side of said chain for supporting said chain, said chain being provided over a lamellar chain comprising a plurality of warp and separation plates connected with each other by means of the long pins, guide rollers being provided for supporting said lamellar chain thereon, a pair of warp delivery rollers being provided at one side of said chain and a pair of take-up rollers being provided at the other end of said chains for effecting let off a take up action.<br>
Further according to this invention there is provided a process of multished warp weaving characterised by the step of forming a plurality of parallel sheds simultaneously, opening said shed throughout the warp width by pressing warp thread individually, inserting the picks through each of said shed, raising the pressure bar chain partially, beating-up said picks by moving the lamellar chain towards the fell of the cloth, moving the comb one by one out of the warp after the fell of the cloth is struck, pushing the comb one by one into the warp simultaneously and then reducing the warp tension for the next cycle of weaving.<br><br>
In   accordance   with  this   invention   the<br>
apparatus for use with the multished warp weaving system has rolling bars connected with each other by means of<br>
arcuiar links. The roll ing/pressure bars are provided at a predetermined distance between each other and are<br>
linked together by means of arcuiar links. This assembly constitute a pressure bar chain assembly and is<br>
supported on a plurality of sprockets. This assembly can be raised or lowered on the lamellar chain. The<br>
lamellar chain has warp end separation plates having shedding projections provided integrally therewith at a<br>
preselected sits and in accordance with the pattern of the weave desired to be woven. The warp end separation<br>
plate are of following kinds<br>
1.    the warp end separation plate having no projection 2.    the warp end separation plate with projection only on right side,<br>
3.	the warp end separation plate  having  projection<br>
only on left side and<br>
4.	the warp end separation plate with projection  on<br>
both the sides.<br>
These warp end separation plates are assembled to form lamellar chain in accordance with the weave pattern.<br>
Each warp end separation plate has a window provided between the shedding projection and a projected spite<br>
provided towards one end of the separation plates.   The<br><br>
warp and separation plates are assembled such that to form a tubular path for the picking medium and the picks. The plurality of spite of warp end separation plate forms a comb for effecting the beating during the weaving process, The adjacent section (wrap end separation plate) of the lamellar chain are hinged together by means of long pins and the lamellar chain is supported on the guide rollers. This chain is adapted to roll towards the fell of the cloth and backward. The pressure bar chain is supported on a pair of rollers provided between either ends of the pressure chain. One pair of said rollers is provided to deliver extra warp during shedding and rotate backward to retruct wrap at the time of beat-up. The other pair of rollers are provided to effect let off and take-up action during the weaving process.<br>
Further in  accordance with  this  invention  following  steps  are followed during the weaving process:-<br>
1. a number of parallel sheds are formed simultaneously and each one is open through out the warp width by pressing individual warp thread (under low tension) between profiled lamellar having number of raised portions interspersed with the straight portions in accordance with weave pattern form below and pressure bars from above.<br>
2.	equal  number  of picks are then  inserted  through<br>
each of the so formed sheds.<br>
3,	raising  the pressure bar partially in  conjunction<br>
with   tightening  the  warp,  thus  resulting   in reduction in shed opening.<br>
4.   beating  up  of each pick by  moving  the  profiled lamellar   chain  which  comprises  beat-up   combs towards the fell of the cloth.<br>
5.   moving  the comb one by one out of the line of  the warp after the fell of the cloth is struck by  them to effect the beat—up of corresponding pick. 6.   pushing  the  combs  one  by  one  into  the   warp simultaneously  with the movement of the combs  one by one out of the line of warp and then<br>
7,   reducing  the  warp tension to prepare it  for  the steps mentioned above for the next site.<br>
An  apparatus  for use in  a  multished  warp weaving  system and a process of multished warp  weaving according to a preferred -embodiment is herein  described and illustrated in the accompanying drawings wherein:-Fig. 1       shows the plan view of the device,<br>
Fig»2-~Fig,7  shows operational steps formed  during  the weaving process.<br>
Referring to the drawings particularly fig. 1<br>
the  apparatus for ise in roultished warp weaving  system has  a  plurality of rolling bars 10 adapted  to  extend<br>
o/er  the  entire width of the warp.  The  ends  of  the r ill ing  bars  are secured with each other by  means  of<br>
arcular  links 11 in order to constitute a pressure  bar chain  2.   The  pressure  bar  chain 2 is supported  on<br>
sprocket  12,  The pressure bar chain 2 and sprocket  12 forms a pressure bar chain assembly adapted to be raised<br>
or  lowered  on  to the lamellar  chain 1 by a  suitable raising and lowering mechanism.  Pairs of warp  delivery<br>
rollers  14 rotate forward to deliver extra warp  during shedding and are adapted to rotate back to retract  warp<br>
at  the  time  of  beat-up.   Delivery  rollers  14   in conjection with the take—up rollers 15 are also used  to<br>
effect  let  off and take-up action during  the  weaving process.   The pressure bar chain assembly 2 is provided<br>
over a lamellar chain assembly 1.  The lamellar chain is made  of fined sheet metal warp end separation plates  3<br>
having   shedding  projections  4 embossed  in  them  at preselected sits in accordance with the pattern of weave<br>
desired to be woven.  These warp end separation plates 3 are of the following kind:-<br>
1.    the warp end separation plate having no projection<br>
2.	the? warp end separation plate with projection only<br>
on right side,<br>
3.	the warp end separation plate  having  projection<br>
only on left side and<br>
4.	the warp end separation plate with projection  on<br>
both the sides.<br>
These  warp  end  separation  plates  3   are<br>
assembled  to  form the lamellar chain 1  in  accordance with  the  weave  pattern. Each plate  3  has  a  window<br>
portion  5  through  which the  picking  operation  take place.   The portion between the shedding  projection  4<br>
and  the   projected spite 6  provided in the  warp  end separation   plate  constitutes  the  window   5.    The<br>
adjacent  end  of the warp end separation  plate  3  (as shown in fig.lA) are hinged together by means of a pin 7<br>
to form a lamellar chain 1. The spite 6 forms a comb for effecting  heat-up  action  during  the  weaving.    The<br>
windows  5  of the warp end separation plate  3  form a channel  which provides a tubular path for  the  picking<br>
medium and the pick.  The pressure bar chain 2 can  roll towards the? fell of the cloth 9 and backward.<br>
According  to the process of  this  invention the  rolling bars 10 of the pressure chain 2 are set  at<br>
their top position and the warp is tensioned as shown in fig.2.  All the warp ends are in one plane just touching<br>
top of upper shedding.  During the next step of  weaving the   rolling  bars  10 are brought to  the  lower  most<br>
position  and  the sheds are fully opened  as  shown  in fiq.3.   The multiple picks as shown in fig.4  are  then<br>
inserted  simultaneously and are kept in face with  each other,<br>
As  shown in fig. 5  and when the  picking  is<br>
over the rolling  bars 10 are moved in the  intermediate position  and the sheds are partially opened.  At   this<br>
position the beat—up step is  started.  During  beating, and  as  shown in fig. 6 lamellar shedding chain  1  and<br>
pressure  bar chain 2 starts moving towards fell of  the cloth.    As. shown in fig.7 the pressure bars are  moved<br>
towards  the  top  position and the  beat—up  action  is completed and the apparatus is ready for the next  cycle<br>
of weaving.<br>
According  to the process of  this  invention<br>
and  with  the  help of  the  shedding  system  employed multiple sheds are open and close simultaneously in  one<br>
step,however, the frequency of shedding is allowed to be low  without effecting the productivity.   The  shedding<br>
takes place at the time when the warp is very loose and therefore the warp receives a very gentle treatment  and<br>
breaks are minimised.  As sheds are open through out the width of the warp pick speed is maximised.  The  beat—up<br>
action  is done in open shed and warp to  pick  friction dt3»s not come in picture to ensure gentle treatment  of<br>
warp and weft during beat-up step. Further the warp  are individually controlled during shedding therefore a very<br>
big weave pattern both warp on weft way is possible.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
