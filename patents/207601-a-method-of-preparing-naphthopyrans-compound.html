THE PATENTS ACT 1970 [39 OF 1970]<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10, Rule 13]<br>
"A METHOD OF PREPARING NAPHTHOPYRANS COMPOUND"<br>
CORNING SAS, a French limited company of 7bis Avenue de Valvins, 77920 Samois sur Seine, France,<br><br>
The  following  specification   particularly  describes  the  nature   of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br>
GRANTED<br><br><br><br><br>
The present invention relates to novel naphthopyran-type compounds which are annelated in C5-C6 with an indene- or dihydronaphthalene-type carbocycle, and which have, in particular, photochromic properties. The invention also relates to photochromic compositions and photochromic ophthalmic articles (lenses for example) which contain said naphthopyrans. The invention also covers the preparation of these novel compounds.<br>
The photochromic compounds are capable of changing colour under the influence of a poly- or mono-chromatic light (UV for example) and of returning to their initial colour when the luminous irradiation ceases, or under the influence of temperature and/or a poly- or mono-chromatic light different from the first.<br>
The photochromic compounds find applications in various fields, e.g. for the manufacture of ophthalmic lenses, contact lenses, solar protection glasses, filters, camera optics or photographic apparatus optics or other optical devices and observation devices, glazing, decorative objects, bill elements or even for information storage by optical inscription (coding).<br>
In the field of ophthalmic optics, and in particular the spectacles trade, a photochromic lens which comprises one or more photochromic compounds must have :<br>
-	a high transmission in the absence of ultraviolets,<br>
-	a low transmission (high colourability) under solar irradiation,<br>
-	adapted coloration and discoloration kinetics,<br>
-	a tint acceptable to the consumer (grey or brown preferably) with preferably a maintenance of the chosen tint during the coloration and the discoloration of the lens,<br>
-	a maintenance of the performances, the properties, within a temperature range of 0-40°C,<br>
-	a significant durability, since these objectives sought after are sophisticated corrective lenses and therefore expensive.<br>
These lens characteristics are in fact determined by the active photochromic compounds which they contain; compounds which must furthermore be perfectly compatible with the organic or inorganic, even hybrid support which constitutes the lens.<br><br>
Moreover, it is to be noted that obtaining a grey or brown tint may necessitate the use of at least two photochromes of different colours, i.e. having distinct maximal absorption wavelengths in the visible. This combination further imposes other requirements of the photochrornic compounds. In particular, the coloration and discoloration kinetics of the (two or more) combined active photochrornic compounds must be essentially identical. The same applies for their stability with time and also for their compatibility with a plastic, inorganic or organic-inorganic hybrid support.<br>
Amongst the numerous photochrornic compounds described in the prior<br>
art, benzopyrans and naphthopyrans may be cited which are described in patents or<br>
patent applications: US-A-3,567,605, US-A-3,627,690, US-A-4,826,977,<br>
US-A-5,200,116,	US-A-5,238,981,     US-A-5,411,679,       US-A-5,429,744,<br>
US-A-5,451,344,	US-A-5,458,814,     US-A-5,651,923,        US-A-5,645,767,<br>
US-A-5,698,141,	US-A-5,783,116,     WO-A-95 05382,       FR-A-2,718,447,<br>
WO-A-96 14596, WO-A-97 21698, which are of the reduced formulae below :<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Benzopyrans<br><br>
2H-Naphthopyrans<br><br>
3H-Naphthopyrans<br><br>
In particular, patent documents WO-A-99 31082 and US-A-5,869,658 claim 5H-naphthopyran-type structures in which there exists an aryl group in R4 :<br><br><br><br><br><br>
WO-A-99 31082<br><br>
US-A-5,869,658<br><br>
These compounds claim to satisfy the specifications defined above. In reality, if these compounds really do have one or more of the basic properties sought after, such as a high transmission in the absence of ultraviolets and a high colourability under solar irradiation, none of the compounds described hitherto have the complete combination of the properties sought after which are necessary for the production of<br><br>
satisfactory articles. In particular, none of these compounds is intrinsically grey or brown and the necessity of using an additional photochrome in order to obtain one of these two tints does subsist.<br>
In this context, it is to the credit of the inventors for having been interested in this type of derivative as a base for developing novel photochromes, and for having proposed a novel family of molecules which have particularly advantageous photochromic properties.<br>
Thus, according to a first of its aspects, the present invention relates to compounds of formulae (I) and (II):<br><br><br>

number of carbons in order to be branched (i.e. more than 3, more than 3, and more<br>
than 4 carbon atoms respectively).<br>
The compounds of the invention - annelated naphthopyrans of formulae<br>
(I) and (II) - have very fast discoloration kinetics combined with a high colourability. Amongst said compounds of the invention, preferred are those which<br>
have the formulae (I) and/or (II) in which :<br>
• R1 , R2 are identical or different and represent independently optionally substituted aryl or heteroaryl groups the basic structure of which is selected from the group comprising phenyl, naphthyl, biphenyl, pyridyl, furyl, benzofuryl, dibenzofuryl, N-(C1-C6)alkylcarbazole, thienyl, benzothienyl, dibenzothienyl and julolidinyl groups ; R1 and/or R2 representing, advantageously, a para-substituted phenyl group; or R1 and R2 together form an adamantyl or norbornyl group ;<br><br>
•	R4 and R5 represent, independently, a halogen, an alkyl group or an alkoxy group;<br>
•	R7 represents a hydroxy or an alkyl group and R$ represents a hydrogen or an alkyl group ;<br>
•	m and n = 1 and o = 0.<br>
According to a second of its aspects, the present invention relates to a method of preparation of the compounds (I) and (II), characterised in that it comprises condensing :<br>
•	an intermediate product of formula (III) or (IV) which are given<br>
below :<br><br>
in which R3, R4, R5, R6, m, n and o are as defined supra with reference to formulae (I) and (II);<br>
•	with a derivative of propargylic alcohol, having formula (V)<br>
below:<br><br>
in which R1 and R2 are as defined supra with reference to formulae<br>
(I) and (II);<br>
the condensation (III) or (IV)/(V) being carried out advantageously<br>
in the presence of a catalyst, this catalyst being preferably selected<br>
from    the    group     comprising    para-toluenesulphonic    acid,<br>
dodecylsulphonic acid or bromoacetic acid ;<br>
or<br>
•	with an aldehyde derivative, having formula (V) below :<br><br><br>
in which R1 and R2 are as defined supra with reference to formulae (I) and (II);<br>
the   condensation    (III)    or   (IV)/(V')    being    carried    out,<br>
advantageously, in the presence of a metallic complex, preferably a<br>
complex of titanium, titanium (IV) ethoxide being particularly<br>
preferred.<br>
In practice, the condensation reaction between compounds (III) or (IV)<br>
and (V) or (V') can take place in solvents such as toluene, xylene or tetrahydrofuran,<br>
to which appropriate catalysts are optionally added. For more details on the<br>
condensation of compounds (III) or (IV)/(V'), reference may be made to the EP-A-0<br>
562 915 patent application.<br>
The compounds of formula (V) are known to the person skilled in the art and are obtained from the corresponding ketone according to a method described notably in the WO-A-96 14596 patent application. The ketone is itself commercial or is prepared according to the known methods such as the Friedel Crafts method (cf. WO-A-96 14596 and cited references).<br>
Aldehydes (V), which are derivatives of (V), are obtained by rearrangement in an acid medium (cf. J. Org. Chem., 1977, 42, 3403).<br><br>
The oxidation in the air of the compounds (IIa) in the presence of a basic PTC such as benzyltrimethylammonium hydroxide leads to compounds (IIb) which<br>
In the case of the compounds of formula II, the condensation of the compounds of formula IV with compounds of formula V or V leads to the intermediate Ha (compound of formula (II) in which R7 = R8 = H) which can be derivatised, notably in the following manner :<br><br>
are hydroxyalkylated by organometallic reagents such as methyllithium in order to provide compounds (IIe).<br>
Alternatively, compounds (Ha) can be alkylated by metallation with a base such as butyllithium, and then reaction with an alkyl iodide such as CH3I in order to provide compounds (IId) and then compounds (IIe).<br>
The preparation of the other compounds of formula (II) is within reach of the person skilled in the art. For all intents and purposes, it may still be indicated in a non-limiting way :<br>
-	that the compounds of formula (II) in which R7 + R8 = cycloalkyl can be prepared from the corresponding compounds of formula (IId) above in which "R7" is an alkyl functionalised with a leaving group. Said "compounds of formula (IId)" are subjected to an intramolecular nucleophilic substitution of said leaving group; and<br>
-	that compounds of formula (II) in which R7 or Rg = alkoxy, -OCOR9 -OCOOR9 can be obtained in a classical manner from the corresponding compounds of formula (II) in which R7 or Rg = OH.<br>
Compounds of formula (III) and (IV) are obtained according to a synthesis scheme, the various steps of which are adaptations of known methods. The preferred general synthesis scheme is given below :<br><br>
In a first step, acid VI (commercial or prepared according to known methods) is converted into acid chloride VII. The latter chloride is then allowed to<br><br>
condense with a p-tetralone VIII or a p-indanone X in the presence of a large excess of NaH in order to lead to intermediates IX and XI which are cyclised to give III and IV, respectively, by heating in the presence of an acid such as phosphoric acid.<br>
According to a third of its aspects, the invention also relates to the novel intermediate products of formulae (III) and (IV), recalled below :<br><br>
in which R3, R4, R5, R6, m, n and o are as defined above with reference to formulae (I) and (II).<br>
According to a fourth of its aspects, the object of the invention is (co)polymer(s) and/or reticulate(s) obtained by polymerising and/or cross-linking and/or grafting at least one compound (I) or (II) as defined above. The compounds (I) and (II) according to the invention can be per se (co)monomers and/or be comprised in (co)polymerisable and/or cross-linkable (co)monomers. The (co)polymers and/or reticulates thus obtained can constitute photochromic matrices such as those presented infra.<br>
According to a fifth of its aspects, the present invention relates to the use of said compounds of formula (I) or (II) of the invention as photochromic agents. Another object of the invention is, therefore :<br>
-	firstly, novel photochromic compounds which are constituted by the C5-C6-annelated naphthopyran derivatives such as defined above, taken alone or in a mixture of themselves and/or with at least one other photochromic compound of another type and/or with at least one non-photochromic colouring agent ;<br>
-	secondly, novel photochromic compositions which comprise at least one compound (I) or (II) as defined above, and/or at least one linear or cross-linked (co)polymer containing at least one compound (I) or (II) according to the invention in its structure. Such photochromic compositions can contain at least one other photochromic compound, of another type and/or at least one non-photochromic colouring agent and/or at least one stabilising agent. These   photochromic   compounds   of  another   type,   non-photochromic<br><br>
colouring agents, and stabilising agents are prior art products known to the<br>
person skilled in the art. Within the context of the present invention, combinations of photochromic compounds of the invention and/or combinations of photochromic compounds of the invention and photochromic compounds of another type according to the prior art are particularly recommended ; such combinations being interesting in that they are suitable for generating grey or brown tints, which are desired by the public in applications such as ophthalmic spectacles or solar spectacles. These additional photochromic compounds can be those known to the person skilled in the art and described in the literature, e.g. chromenes (US-A-3,567,605, US-A-5,238,981, WO-A-94 22850, EP-A-0 562 915), spiropyrans or naphthospiropyrans (US-A-5,238,981) and spiroxazines (Crano et al., "Applied Photochromic Polymer Systems", Ed. Blackie &amp; Son Ltd, 1992, chapter 2 ).<br>
Said compositions according to the invention can also comprise :<br>
-	non-photochromic colouring agents which enable adjusting the tint,<br>
-	and/or one or more stabilising agents, such as an anti-oxidising agent for example,<br>
-	and/or one or more anti-UV,<br>
-	and/or one or more anti-radicals,<br>
-	and/or one or more photochimic excited state deactivators.<br>
These additives can notably enable improving the durability of said compositions.<br>
The compounds of the invention envisaged within the context of their photochromic applications can be used in solution. Thus, a photochromic solution can be obtained by dissolving at least one of said compounds in an organic solvent such as toluene, dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran or ethanol. The solutions obtained are in general colourless and transparent. When exposed to sunlight, they develop a strong coloration and regain the colourless state when they are placed in an area of less exposure to the sun's rays or, in other words, when they are no longer submitted to UV. In general, a very low concentration of product (of the order of 0.01 to 5% by weight) is sufficient to obtain an intense coloration.<br>
The compounds according to the invention are furthermore compatible with support matrices of organic polymer or of inorganic material (even of an inorganic-organic hybrid material), in a form included in said matrices as well as in the form of a coating of said matrices.<br><br>
Also, within the context of the fifth aspect of the invention in relation to the photochromic applications, the object of the invention is a matrix which comprises :<br>
-	at least one compound (I) or (II), as defined supra ;<br>
-	and/or at least one (co)polymer and/or reticulate, as defined supra ;<br>
-	and/or at least one composition, as presented above.<br>
The most interesting applications of the compounds of the invention are in fact those in which the photochrome is dispersed uniformly within or on the surface of a matrix formed by a polymer and/or copolymer and/or mixture of (co)polymers.<br>
Following the example of their behaviour in solution, the compounds (I) or (II), included in a polymer matrix are colourless or slightly coloured in the initial state and rapidly develop an intense coloration under a UV light (365 nm) or under a light source of the solar type. Finally, they regain their initial coloration once the irradiation ceases.<br>
The methods of implementation which can be envisaged in order to obtain such a matrix are very varied. Amongst those known to the person skilled in the art, the diffusion in the (co)polymer, from a suspension or solution of the photochrome, in a silicone oil, in an aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon, or in a glycol, or from another polymer matrix, can be cited for example. The diffusion is commonly carried out at a temperature of 50 to 200°C for a period of time of 15 minutes to several hours, according to the nature of the polymer matrix. Another implementation technique consists in mixing the photochrome in a formulation of polymerisable materials, depositing this mixture on a surface or in a mould, and then carrying out the copolymerisation. These implementation techniques , and others, are described in the article by Crano et ah "Spiroxazines and their use in photochromic lenses" published in Applied Photochromic Polymer Systems, Ed. Blackie and Son Ltd -1992.<br>
The following products may be mentioned as examples of preferred polymer materials for forming matrices which are useful in optical applications of the photochromic compounds according to the invention :<br>
- those obtained from alkyl, cycloalkyl, (poly or oligo)ethylene glycol, aryl or arylalkyl mono-, di- tri- or tetraacrylate or mono-, di-, tri- or tetramethacrylate, which is optionally halogenated or which comprises at least one ether and/or ester and/or carbonate<br><br>

Such resins have   been   described   by   the   Applicant   in   the   French   patent   Application FR-A-2,762,845.<br><br>
The amount of photochrome used in the (co)polymer matrix depends upon the degree of darkening desired. Usually, between 0.001 and 20% by weight of it is used.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
EXAMPLE 1:	SYNTHESIS OF COMPOUND (C1)<br><br>
Step 1 :<br>
Thionyl chloride (16 ml) is allowed to react with homoveratric acid 6 (19.6 g) in dichloromethane (100 ml) in the presence of a catalytic amount of DMF (0.5 ml). Stirring is effected under reflux for 4h. The solvent is then evaporated off to provide 22.7 g of acid chloride 7 (yellow oil). Step 2:<br>
NaH (800 mg of a 60% suspension in mineral oil) is cautiously added in portions to a solution of 7 (2.14 g) and 2-indanone 10 (1.32 g) in THF (15 ml). Stirring is effected under reflux for 1h, and then 0.4 g of sodium hydride are added. Stirring is continued for 1h, and the mixture is then hydrolysed with a 1N solution of HCl. After extraction and evaporation of the solvents, the reaction mixture is purified by silica column chromatography to provide compound 11 (1.04 g, yellow powder). Step 3 :<br>
15 ml of an 85% aqueous solution of phosphoric acid are added to a solution of 11 (2.5 g) in toluene (30 ml). The water present in the medium is distilled off with the aid of a Dean-Stark apparatus. Stirring is effected under reflux for 5h.<br><br>
The mixture is cooled, water is added, and the precipitate of naphthol 4 (800 mg dry, beige solid) is filtered off. Step 4:<br>
A few crystals of pTSA (para-toluenesulphonic acid) are added to a solution of 400 mg of naphthol 4 and 370 mg of 1,1-diphenylpropyn-l-ol in 10 ml of chloroform. Stirring under reflux is effected for 1h. The reaction mixture is then purified by filtration over silica. The solid obtained is recrystallised to provide 160 mg of slightly pink crystals which are pure by 'H NMR.<br>
EXAMPLE 2 :	SYNTHESIS OF COMPOUND (C2)<br>
Step 1:<br>
0.5 ml of a 40% by weight solution of benzyltrimethylammonium hydroxide is added to a solution of compound C1 (160 mg) in 15 ml of THF. Reaction is allowed with air for 2h, and the mixture is poured into H2O and is acidified with 1N HC1 solution. The precipitate is filtered off and recrystallised to provide 110 mg of orange crystals. Step 2:<br>
1 ml of a 1M solution of methyllithium are added at 0°C to a solution of 190 mg of the product of step 1 in 10 ml of THF. Reaction is allowed for 10 min, and 0.5 ml of methyllithium are then added. After stirring for 10 min at 0°C, the mixture is hydrolysed with a 1N HC1 solution and is extracted with ethyl acetate. After evaporation of the solvent, the reaction mixture is purified over silica, and the recrystallised to provide 110 mg of yellow crystals, correct by 'H NMR.<br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 3:	SYNTHESIS OF COMPOUND (C3)<br>
Step 1 :<br>
This step is analogous to step 1 of Example 1. 18.5 g of a yellow oil are obtained from 16.1 g of homoveratric acid 6 and 4.1 ml of thionyl chloride.<br>
Step 2 :<br>
5.47 g of a white solid, which is in accordance with the desired product 9 by 'H RMN, are obtained according to a method which is analogous to that of step 2 of Example 1, from 7.67 g of 2-tetralone 8, 8.21 g of NaH and the product of step 1, Step 3 :<br>
2.05 g of a slightly yellow solid are obtained according to a method which is analogous to that of step 3 of Example 1, from 3 g of the product of step 2. Step 4:<br>
A few crystals of pTSA are added to a solution of 1 g of the product of step 3 and 889 mg of 1,1-diphenylpropyn-l-ol in 100 ml of chloroform. Stirring is effected under reflux for 4h. The mixture is cooled, and purified by filtration over silica to provide 513 mg of an orange solid, correct by 'H NMR.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 4 : SYNTHESIS OF COMPOUND (C4)<br>
A few crystals of pTSA are added to a solution of 470 mg of the product of step 3 of Example 3 and 554 mg of l,l-bis(p-methoxyphenyl)-propyn-l-ol in 50 ml of chloroform. Stirring under reflux is effected for 4h. The mixture is cooled, and purified by filtration over silica to provide 509 mg of a pink solid, correct by 'H NMR.<br>
