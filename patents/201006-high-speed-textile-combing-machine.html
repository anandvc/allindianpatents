				<td>(HIGH SPEED TEXTILE COMBING MACHINE   )<br>
This invention relates to a high speed textile combing machine which is capable of producing higher nipping rate. This machine processes laps with higher feed weight.<br>
Known combing machines are driven by a main motor. This motor drives the main drive shaft through pulleys and belt. This main drive shaft provides the input drive to the head stock which houses the gearing. Output drives are provided for driving the comb shaft, nipper shaft and detaching roller shaft. The drive fi"om the comb shaft is utilized for driving the rotating elements of the delivery end namely, the drafting system, coiler, can plate, feed roller, table calender roller and aspirator drum. This drive arrangement has many gears including angular gears. Large number of gears in the gear train limits the working speed of the machine. Noise generation is yet another inherent problem faced with when gear trains of large number of gears are in operation.<br>
Combing machines in which the batt to be combed is unwound by the rotation of the lap feed rollers fixjm a lap disposed thereon are known. The batt is delivered to the feed rollers mounted in oscillating nippers through an eccentric roller attached to tiie top nipper drive shaft and the guide plate attached to the bottom nipper bracket. Since the feed rollers mounted on the oscillating nipper are driven periodically it will result in non uniform stretch on the haU between the lap feed roller and nipper feed roller, if the eccentric roller and nipper feed roller movement is not synchronized.<br><br>
Air turtxilance may also affect the batt if not properly protected therefrom. In high speed combing machines, the batt is to be guided from tiie lap feed roller area to the nif^jer feed roller area to avoid stretch on the batt between these areas.<br>
Combing process is known to persons^ldlled in the art The combing head has rotating lap rollers, rotatable comb shaft, an oscillating nipper shaft and detaching roller pairs. The nipper s^iaft reciprocates between the open and closed position of the nippers. The top nipper and the bottom nipper are articulated such that the nif^r pairs close and open periodically due to the oscillating movements of the nipper shaft. The lap unwound due to the rotation of lap rollers moves to the nip of the nippers via a feed plate and nipper feed rollers. In the closed position the lap is clamped in the nip of the nippers and the tufts projecting fix)m the nippers is combed by the revolving comb and is taken by the detaching roller pair when the nif^r reaches its open position. Since the nippers oscillate continuously, its mass exerts certain Umitation on the speed of the comber. In order to have better fibre control, it is imperative that the distance between the nipper feed roller and detaching roller is kept as minimum as possible. For high speed combing, the nippers should be capable of handling heavier laps in the order of 60-80 grams per meter.<br>
The detaching rollers receive the combed tufts which are delivered in succession. Combed tufts are formed into a web which is delivered down stream to a pair of delivery rollers mounted on the frame. In the known combing machines, a web guide plate is disposed between the detaching<br><br>
rollers and delivery rollers to guide the web. The delivery rollers rotate continuously at a constant speed whereas the detaching rollers are rotated forward and backward resulting in the wave formation of the web. This wave formation will increase according to increase in the number of nips produced by the comber. During high speed operation, wave formation will cause lapping on the rubber cot mounted upper detaching roller.<br>
High speed combing machines must have a drafting system with better fibre control with &amp;cilities to provide higher drafts.<br>
Can changers for ejecting a full can while replacing the same with an empty can positioned beneath the coiler head of the comber are known. One such linear can changer essentially consists of a reciprocating slider assembly for receiving and positively positioning an empty can, preparatory to subsequent can change operation. The can beneath the coiler is mounted on a rotating can plate and positioned with suitable guide means. Upon filling of the can beneath the coiler, the slider assembly reciprocates to replace the fiill can beneath the coiler with an empty can. The slider assembly reciprocates to its home position leaving the empty can on the drive means to receive the sHver delivered by the coiler. This reciprocating motion is achieved by pneumatic cylinders which are long as it has to transfer the empty can fi'om the home position to the position beneath the coiler. This is much pronounced when the diameter of the can is large. The size of the can changer has also to be increased to accommodate a large pneumatic cylinder.<br><br>
The object of this invention is to provide a drive arrangement which will overcome the drawbacks of the existing drive arrangement. This is particularly suitable for high speed combing machines.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide a synchronizing means between the nipper feed roller and the lap feed roller to maintain a uniform stretch on the batt between the lap feed rollers and the nipper feed rollers when the batt is routed through the guide sheet provided to facilitate the working of the comber at high speed.<br>
A web guide device is also provided to reduce wave formation of the web during high speed combing.<br>
A cost effective can changer also is incorporated in the high speed textile combing machine of this invention.<br>

Lap stretch compensator:<br>
Part of the combing head shown in figure 4 has lap rollers (65) and (65a), rotating comb shaft (77), nipper shaft (78) rotateable in reciprocation<br><br>
and two detaching rollers (79, 79a), all mounted on the machine frame. The nipper shaft (78) which reciprocates between the two positions shown in figure 5 and 6. The rear end of the bottom nipper (68) is attached to the crank (81). Front end of the bottom nipper attached to the arm (80) pivotally mounted to the comb shaft (77), The lap which is to be combed is carried on the lap rollers (65) and (65a) in the form of coil. The lap unwind due to the rotation of the lap rollers (65,65a) and goes to the lap stretch compensator<br>
(69)	and moves there on to the nipper feed roller (66) and there from to the<br>
nip between the top and bottom ni{^rs.<br>
Guide sheet (69a) of the lap stretch compensator (69) is rigidly fitted to the frame of the Comber and disposed such that the slightly curved edge (69al) of the guide plate (69a) is just held above the top nipper drive shaft (71). This guide sheet (69a) guide the batt in the region from the lap feed roller (65) to the guide plate (69b) of the lap stretch compensator (69),<br>
Eccentrics (70) are hinged on the top nipper drive shaft (71) such that the axes of the top nipper drive shaft (71) and the eccentrics (70) are parallel to each other and the eccentric can swing freely on the top nipper drive shaft (71). For ease of mounting and dismantling, the eccentrics (70) described in this embodiment consisting of top and bottom part such that the eccentric<br>
(70)	can be advantageously mounted on the top nipper drive shaft (71). A<br>
pin (72) is provided to the bottom part of the eccentric (70) such that the<br>
axes of the pin (72) and the top nipper drive shaft (71) are parallel to each<br>
other.<br><br>
Supports (73) provided with pins (74) for holding the guide plate (69b) of the lap stretch compensator (69) are fastened to the bottom nipper bracket. The lap stretch compensator (69) employs a contour so as to guide the batt gently. Guide plate (69b) of the lap stretch compensator (69) is provided with a hinge (76) to facilitate suspending the same in the pin (72) provided in the bottom part of the eccentrics (70). The hinge is made of synthetic material to facilitate quiet operation in the absence of metal to metal contact.<br>
For fixing the bottom portion of the guide plate (69b) of tiie lap stretch compensator (69) forks (75) are fitted on it. The forks (75) along with the lap stretch compensator guide plate (69b) can be gently inserted to the pins (74) attched to the supports (73).<br>
The extreme backward movement position of the oscillating nipper (67) is illustrated in Figure 6. In this position, the distance between the lap feed roller (65) and the nipper feed roller (66) reduces as compared to its extreme forward movement position as illustrated in Figure 5. Due to the reduction in the distance between the lap feed roller (65) and nipper feed roller (66), and the batt is slackened.<br>
One end of the guide sheet (69b) of the lap stretch compensator is hinged to the pin (74) of the support (73) attached to the oscillating bottom nipper (68) and the other end hinged to the pin (72) of the eccentric (70), which can swing fi-eely about the top nipper drive shaft (71). The guide sheet (69b) swing the eccentric (70) through an angle and the guide sheet<br><br>
(69b)   assumes the position as shown in figure 6 suf^rt the batt and compensate the slag.<br>
Figure 5 illustrates the extreme forward movement position of the oscillating nipper (67). At this position the distance between the lap fe^ roller (65) and nipper feed roller (66) increases, and the batt is stretched. By virtue of the fixing arrangement of the guide plate (69b), as explained earlier, the guide plate swings the eccentric (70) through an angle opposite to that as compared during the backward movement of the oscillating nipper, and the guide plate assumes the position as shown in figure 5 and supports the batt.<br>
The embodiment as explained above i&amp;cilitate the movement of the lap stretch compensator guide plate (69b) in synchronization with the forward and backward movement of the oscillating nipper (67) in such a way tiiat, the effective length of the batt guide sur&amp;ce is continuously altered and the stretch of the batt delivered to ftic nipper feed rollers (66) is maintained uniformly throughout the combing cycle. Also the lap stretch compensator (69) according to this invention guide the batt fiiUy and thereby the air turbulence will not have any impact on the batt.<br>
The nipper used in this invention is made of light weight material such as aluminum alloy with minimum linkages and designed suitable for handling heavier laps say in the order of 60-80 grams per meter for high speed running of the comber. In order to have better fibre control it is imperative that the distance between the nipper feed roller and detaching<br><br>
roller should be adopted as minimum as possible and for this purpose a distance ot 40 mm is used.<br>
Web guide device:<br>
The invention is directed to web guide device for a combing machine comprising detaching roller pairs (79, 79a, 84, 85) disposed in vertical overlying relation to each other to deliver fibre web and a pair of delivery rollers (86,87) for receiving the web which is delivered by the detaching roller. The web guiding device comprising a curved guide plate (89) positioned between the detaching rollers (84,85) and delivery rollers (86,87) and a directing changing plate (90). The edge of tiie curved web guide plate (89) is kept at a distance (D) of 7mm to 13mm from a line parallel to the edge of the curved guide plate (89) and a line passing through the centre of the lower detaching roller (84). The curved guide plate (89) is provided with a curved guide sur&amp;ce (89.1) and a second guide sur&amp;ce (89.2) facing the detaching roller to deflect the web delivered from the detaching rollers in an upward direction. The web (W) which is deflected in upward direction establishes contact with the sur&amp;ce of a direction changing plate (90), preferably made of non metallic material. The direction changing plate (90) is so positioned to divert the web in tiie direction of the delivery rollers (86,87). The curvature of the curved guide plate forming an ogee curve ensures a smooth flow of web from detaching roller pair (84,85) and deHvery roller pair (86,87). The curvature of the web guide device is so selected that it ensures a smooth flow of web from detaching roller pair (84,85) to the delivery roller pair (86,87).    The length of the direction<br><br>
changing plate (90) is selected as at least equal to the length of the sur&amp;ce of the curved guide plate (89).<br>
The combing machine has pluralily of combing heads, which comprises two pairs of detaching rollers (79,79a) and (84,85) as well as a pair of delivery rollers (86,87). The detaching rollers (79,79a,84,85) and the delivery rollers (86,87) are mounted so as to be rotated about respective horizontal axes within a machine firame (88) of the combing machine. The rollers (84,85) of the downstream pair of detaching rollers are disposed in vertical overlying relation to each other in order to deUver a fibre web (W) in a substantially horizontal direction (H).<br>
The direction changing plate (90), is located at a distance above the section (89.1) of the curved guide plate (89). The direction changing plate (90) has a surface &amp;cing the curved surface of the curved guide plate, to deflect the web W passing fi-om the section (89.1) of the curved guide plate in a forward direction, away from the detaching rollers (84,85) and towards the pair of delivery rollers (86,87). The direction changing plate (90) extends parallel to the upper sur&amp;ce (89.1) of the curved guide plate (89).<br>
The direction changing plate (90) prevent movement of the web (W) in to the area of the upper detaching roller (85) and clearer roller (91) bearing on the upper detaching n^er (79a,85), to eliminate the risk of lapping. The direction changing plate (90) may be mounted on the machine frame. The web (W) deflected on the direction changing plate (90) is diverted to second section (892) of the curved guide plate and is guided smoothly towards the deUvery rollers (86,87).<br><br>

A steel reinforced tape (110) is laid as shown in the figure 13. The tape (110) envelops the rollers (105, 106, 107, 108) as shown and the free ends of the same is rigidly fastened to the frame (92). The slider assembly is rigidly connected to the steel reinforced tape (110) through connectors (111,112).<br>
Once the can kept underneath the coiler is filled with the predetermined length of sliver, a suitable switching means in conjunction with counting means may be provided for stopping the machine and to initiate the can change cycle. To facilitate can changing, the piston of the pneumatic cylinder (109) is actuated by electro pneumatic means. By virtue of the arrangement of pulleys and tape, as explained, for a displacement of distance L of the piston rod of the said pneumatic cylinder (109^ the slider assembly (98) is displaced by a distance 2L in the direction opposite to that of the movement of the piston rod. The stroke length of the cylinder is<br><br>
so set that the slider assembly (98) along with the empty can kept on it, and held in position by the guides, reaches its predetennined position. The empty can is positioned exactly beneath the coiler (42) to receive the sliver. During the process of the movement of the slider assembly along with the empty can, the full can alredy present on the can plate beneath tiie coiler is pushed out. Sensing means are provided to control the forward movement of the piston. Once the slider assembly reaches its predetermined position, the tbrward movement of the piston ceases and the backward movement of the piston is started. During the backward movement of the piston, the can guides (94, 95, 96, 97) retain the empty can (SC) on the can plate (50) and the slider assembly (98) alone reaches its home position.<br>
Working of the combing machine:<br>
Having discussed hereinabove, the various components of the high speed combing machine, we shall discuss the working of the machine hereinafter.<br>
The lap kept on the lap roller (65, 65a) unwound in the form of sheet due to the rotation of the lap rollers is fed to the nipper feed roller (66) through the lap stretched compensator (69). The nipper feed roller feed the lap to the oscillating nipper (67). The portion of the lap to be combed is held in the nip of the nippers and the comb which is rotatably mounted on the comb shaft (77) combs the lap and the short fibres present therein is combed out. The short fibres are removed by the revolving brush roller and carried by suction arrangement. Combed lap in the form of fleece is taken over by the detaching roller (79,79a,84,85) and fed to the dehvery roller (86,87) through the ogee       shaped curved guide plate ( 89) of the web guiding<br><br>
device. The fleece is taken through the condenser of the table via the take off rollers and sliver is formed. This table has means for collecting plurality of slivers received from the plurality of combing heads. These slivers are delivered to the drafting arrangement in the form of a single sliver. Drafting rollers (11, 12, 13, 14, 15) in co-operation with the rotatably mounted pneumatically loaded and friction driven top rollers resting on them, draft the fibre sliver. Drafted sliver is passed through a pair of calender rollers (59, 59a) and laid over the conveyer belt. The drafted sliver is then fed to the nip of the delivery calender roller through (54, 54a) through delivery condenser and is deposited into the sliver can mounted on the can plate (53) via the coiler (42) delivery plate. After a predetermined length of sliver is deposited, the can changer ejects the full can and places an empty can for subsequent filling.<br>
