Background of invention<br>
This invention relates to certain 3-hydroxy-/v",1,6-trialkyl-4-oxo-1,4-dihydropyridine-2-carboxamide of formula I as orally active iron chelators. Members of the 3-hydroxy-4-oxo-1,4-dihydropy7idfnTciass are well known for their ability to chelate iron in physiological environment and these have been reported as useful in the treating iron related disorders such as thalassaemia and anemia, see US4840958, US5480894, US5688815, J. Med. Chem. 1999, 42(23), 4818-4823.<br>
3-Hydroxy-A/,1,6-trialkyl-4-oxo-1,4-dihydropyridine-2-carboxamide are bidentate iron I chelators with potential for oral administration, see Bioorganic &amp; Medicinal Chemistry 9 (2001), 563-567. A patent application has been published emphasizing the pharmacological properties of this class of compound, see W098/54318. Compounds of formula I have been tested in iron mobilization efficacy assay in rat via the mode of oral administration. The results are reported in Table 3 of W098/54318. Compounds of formula I are chelators possessing high pFe3+ values and show great promise in their ability to remove iron under in-vivo conditions.<br>
3-Hydroxy-/V, 1,6-trimethyl-4-oxo-1,4-dihydropyridine-2-carboxamide has been prepared by the method, described in examples 45 to 48, 53 and 58 of W098/54318. Allomaltol (1) is converted to 2-(1-hydroxymethyl)-6-methylpyromeconic acid (2) according to the procedure described in<br>
FR1516463. The 2-(1-hydroxymethyl)-6-methylpyromeconic acid (2) is reacted with benzyl bromide in sodium hydroxide in a 10 : 1 mixture of methanol and water to give the 2-hydroxymethyl-3-benzyloxy-6-methyl-pyran-4(1 H)-one (3) which is then oxidized with dimethyl sulfoxide and sulfur trioxide.pyridine complex to give 2-formyl-3-benzyloxy-6-methyl-pyran-4(1H)-one (4). Oxidation of the 2-formyl derivative with sulfamic acid and sodium hypochlorite in acetone and water affords 2-carboxyl-3-benzyloxy-6-methyl-pyran-4(1H)-one (5). The 2-carboxyl derivative is reacted with<br><br>
dicyclohexyldiimide and 2-mercaptothiazoline and 4-dimethylaminopyridine to give the 3-(2-carbonyl-3-benzyloxy-6-methyl-4(1 H)-pyran-2-yl)-1,3-thiazolidine-2-thione (6) which is reacted with methylamine in tetrahydrofuran to give 3-benzyloxy-6-methyl-4(1 H)-pyran-2-yl)-2-carboxy-(N-methyl)-amide (7). Compound (7) is converted to 1,6-dimethyl-3-benzyloxy-4(1H)-pyridinone-2-carboxy-(N-methyl)-amide (8) with methylamine in alcohol. The 3-benzyloxy derivative was deprotected with hydrogenation using Pd/C in dimethylformamide as illustrated in Scheme 1 to give 1,6-dimethyl-3-hydroxy-4(1H)-pyridinone-2-carboxy-)N-methyl)-amide (9):<br><br><br>

The IUPAC name of the chemicals shown in Scheme 1 is further clarified<br>
below:<br>
Compound (3): 2-hydroxymethyl-3-benzyloxy-6-methyl-pyran-4(1 H)-one has<br>
an alternate IUPAC name 3-(benzyloxy)-2-(hydroxymethyl)-6-rnethyi-4H-<br>
pyran-4-one.<br>
Compound (5): 2-carboxyl-3-benzyloxy-6-methyl-pyran-4(1H)-one has an alternate IUPAC name 3-(benzyloxy)-6-methyl-4-oxo-4H-pyran-2-carboxylic acid.<br>
Compound (8): 1,6-dimethyl-3-benzyloxy-4(1H)-pyridinone-2-carboxy-(N-methyl)-amide has an alternate IUPAC name: 3-(benzyloxy)-N,1,6-trimethyl-4-oxo-1,4-dihydropyridine-2-carboxamide.<br>
Compound (9): 1,6-dimethyl-3-hydroxy-4(1 H)-pyridinone-2-carboxy-(N-methyl)-amide has an alternate IUPAC Name: 3-hydroxy-N,1,6-trimethyl-4-oxo-1,4-dihydropyridine-2-carboxamide.<br>
When compared to the above process, the applicant's invention introduces a number of advantages over the existing process:<br>
1.	It affords 1,6-dimethyl-3-benzyloxy-4(1 H)-pyridinone-2-carboxy-)N-methyl)-amide in considerably higher yields than existing procedures.<br>
2.	It is amenable to industrial scale production since 3-hydroxy-6-methyl-4(1H)-pyran-2-yl)-2-carboxy-(N-methyl)-amide can be made in less process steps from economically, commercially available reagents.<br><br>
3.	It avoids the use of oxidizing agent such as DMSO, sulfur<br>
trioxide pyridine and the need for column chromatography using diethyl ether and the isolation of the intermediate 2-formyl-3-benzyloxy-6-methyl-pyran-4(1 H)-one. It avoids the generation of large amount of industrial waste and the execution of the synthesis in two distinct separate steps for the conversion of 2-hydroxymethyl-3-benzyloxy-6-methyl-pyran-4(1 H)-one to 3-benzyloxy-2-carboxy-6-methyl-pyran-4(1 H)-one. The conversion of 2-hydroxymethyl-3-benzyloxy-6-methyl-pyran-4(1 H)-one to 3-benzyloxy-2-carboxy-6-methyl-pyran-4(1 H)-one is achieved in one single process step using baking soda (sodium bicarbonate), sodium hypochlorite solution, and TEMPO. The labour cost is significantly reduced because of the short reaction time and ease of work-up.<br>
4.	It avoids the isolation and purification of intermediates such as 3-<br>
hydroxy-2-hydroxymethyl-6-methyl-pyran-4(1H)-one, 3-benzyloxy-2-formyl-6-<br>
methyl-pyran-4(1 H)-one, (3-benzyloxy-6-methyl-4(1 H)-pyran-2-yl)-2-carboxy-<br>
(N-methyl)-amide. The isolation of these intermediates involve extra process<br>
step, labor cost, and waste disposal, thereby rendering the process more expensive.<br>
5.	It eliminates the use of intermediate 3-(2-carbonyl-3-benzyloxy-6-methyl-4(1 H)-pyran-2-yl)-1,3-thiazolidine-2-thione. It does not use 2-mercaptothiazoline, which requires its removal as chemical waste in the later step.<br>
6.	It avoids the use of reagent dicyclohexyldiimide and the generation of dicyclohexylurea waste that are skin irritant.<br>
7.        It does not require three distinct steps for the conversion of 2-carboxyl-3-benzyloxy-6-methyl-pyran-4(1 H)-one to 3-benzyloxy-A/,1,6-trialkyl-4-oxo-1,4-dihydropyridine-2-carboxamide. The conversion is achieved in one single process step. The labour cost is significantly reduced because of the short reaction time and ease of work-up.<br><br>
8.        An efficient process is described for the large scale manufacturing of 2-chlorokojic acid, a key intermediate for the synthesis of allomaltol. The existing literature process is not amenable to large-scale synthesis.<br>
Therefore, one object of the invention is to provide novel process for the production of 1,6-dimethyl-3-benzyloxy-4(1 H)-pyridinone-2-carboxy-(N-methyl)-amide and 1,6-dimethyl-3-hydroxy-4(1 H)-pyridinone-2-carboxy-(N-methyl)-amide from readily available, inexpensive and relatively safe starting material. Other objects of this invention can be recognized by those skills in the art from the summary of invention and detailed description of embodiments thereof.<br>
Summary of Invention<br><br>
According to one aspect of the invention, a process is provided to make the compound of formula I which comprises of the step of oxidation of III to the acid of formula II in a single process step as shown in scheme 2. The oxidants are TEMPO, baking soda, sodium hypochlorite and potassium bromide. Compound II is then reacted with 1,1'-carbonyldiimidazole and ethylamine in an inert solvent to give a compound of formula I in a single process step. The alcohol protective group R5 can be deprotected to give a<br><br>
compound of formula I wherein R5 is hydrogen. The compound of formula III is in turn prepared from the compound of formula IV in a single process step.<br>
Detailed Description of Invention<br>
Allomaltol (compound of formula IV wherein R1 = Me, R4 = H, R5 = H) is reacted with formaldehyde in a sodium hydroxide solution in methanol and water for a period of 6 to 16 hrs. Benzyl chforide was added and the reaction was heated to reflux for 4 to 12 hours, preferably 6 hours. The benzylated alcohol (compound of formula III wherein R1 = Me, R4 = H, R5 = CH2Ph) is isolated by traditional means. This procedure eliminates the use of a more expensive reagent benzyl bromide and the need to isolate the diol intermediate 3-hydroxy-2-hydroxymethyl-6-methyl-pyran-4(1H)-one. The preparation is achieved in one manufacturing process step. The amount of methanol is critical for the success of the experiment, the preferred amount of solvent mixture is methanol and water in the ratio of 3 : 2.<br>
The alcohol III is then oxidized to the acid (compound of formula II wherein R1 = Me, R4 = H, R5 = CH2Ph) in a single process step. Jones reagent (chromium trioxide in sulfuric acid) converts the compound III to acid II in acetone, but the yield is extremely low and is less than 10%. A large amount of chromium waste is created. However, TEMPO, sodium hypochlorite, baking soda and potassium bromide affords the acid in very good yield, without chromatography and further recrystallization. The reaction is carried out in an ice bath, with the internal reaction temperature of less than 10°C. The reagents are extremely cheap and the reaction time is less than 24 hours. TEMPO is used in catalyti; amount.<br>
The various procedures for the preparation of the acid of formula II can be found in Example 3 below. One preferred condition for the TEMPO oxidation of the compound of formula III at laboratory scale involves the use of dichloromethane as a solvent. 5 to 6 ml of dichlormethane is used per gm of a compound of formula II. A mixture of 10% sodium bicarbonate solution (0.8 to 0.9 mole of sodium bicarbonate per mole of alcohol II) in water, sodium bicarbonate solid (2.5 mol per mole of alcohol of formula<br><br>
II) and potassium bromide (0.1 mole per mole of alcohol of formula II) is added to form a mixture. This mixture is vigorously stirred with a mechanical stirrer in a round bottom flask cooled in an ice bath. About 0.01 mole of TEMPO per mole of alcohol and a phase transfer catalyst such as 0.05 mole of tetra-n-butylammonium chloride hydrate per mole of alcohol II are added. The oxidation is then initiated by the slow addition of two mole of sodium hypochlorite in solution (strength 12 to 16% commercial grade) per mole of alcohol II used, with a temperature of the reaction maintained between 0 to 10°C. The preferred pH of the top aqueous layer is maintained between 7.5 to 8.5 during the reaction. To ensure the alcohol of formula III is completely oxidized to the alcohol, additional sodium bicarbonate (0.7 to 0.9 mole per mole alcohol II) and potassium bromide (0.1 mole per mole of alcohol II) are added, followed again by the slow addition of sodium hypochlorite solution (0.6 to 0.8 mole per mole of alcohol II). A third cycle of addition of sodium bicarbonate and sodium hypochlorite solution is sometimes required to drive the reaction to completion. The preferred mode of work-up involves isolating the upper layer of the reaction, filtering off the insoluble salt and then using sodium thiosulfate to destroy any unreacted sodium hypochlorite. Upon acidification with hydrochloric acid to pH 1, the acid of formula II precipitated and can be isolated by suction filtration.<br>
Another preferred procedure for the oxidation of alcohol II to acid of formula II in plant scale involves first suspending the alcohol II in a mixture of water and acetone. Sodium bicarbonate (one mole per mole of alcohol II) is then added with vigorous stirring in an ice bath. Potassium bromide (0.3 mol per mole of alcohol II) and TEMPO (0.02 mole per mole of alcohol) are added when the internal temperature of the reaction is at the range of 0 to 7°C, preferably at 5°C. Sodium hypochlorite solution (10% solution, 3 mole of sodium hypochlorite per mole of alcohol II) is added over a period of 2 to 4 hrs with the internal temperature maintained at below 10°C. The reaction mixture is maintained at a temperature below 10°C in an ice bath for an additional 3 hrs. Excess sodium hypochlorite is destroyed by the addition of solid sodium bisulfite at temperature below 5°C. Hydrochloric acid is then added over a period of 0.5 to 1 hr to precipitate out the compound of formula II. After 2 to 4 hrs, the acid of formula III can be isolated by suction filtration. This procedure eliminates the use of halogenated solvent and the use of a phase transfer catalyst in manufacturing of the compound of formula II when acetone and water are used as reaction solvents.<br><br><br>
In compound of formula I wherein R6 is hydrogen and R3 = R2, the acid II is converted to the amide of formula I in one single process step. The acid is reacted with 1,1'-carbonyldiimidazole in an inert solvent over a period of several hours to give the intermediate A. Without isolation, a solution of methyiamine (R3R6NH2 = CH3NH2) in alcohol is added to generate the amide intermediate B. Again without isolation, the reaction temperature is elevated to between 60 to 100°C, preferably 70 to 80°C for a few hours, to afford the amide of formula I wherein R6R3N = R2NH. A typical example is the single process step manufacturing of a compound of formula I wherein R1 = Me, R2 = Me, R3 = Me, R6 = H, R4 = H, R5 = CH2Ph). The experimental procedure can be further found in example 4 below. The inert solvent used for the formation of intermediate A is preferably dimethylformamide or methyl isobutyl ketone. The alcohol used is methanol. For large- scale reaction, tetrahydrofuran is used to replace the methanol. In a typical reaction, the acid of formula II is reacted with 1,1'-carbonyldiimidazole at temperature between 40 to 60°C, preferably 45 to 50°C for a period of 3 to 5 hrs, preferably 4 hrs. The solution is cooled to room temperature and then reacted with a solution of methyiamine in tetrahydrofuran over a period of 1 to 4 hrs to give the key intermediate B. The excess inert solvent such as methyl isobutyl ketone is removed by evaporation under vacuum. Without isolation, the intermediate B is mixed with a solution of methyiamine (R2NH2 = CH3NH2) in methanol and heated at the reflux temperature of methanol for 1.5 to 2.5 hr. Additional methyiamine in methanol is added from time to time, the reaction is further refluxed until all intermediate B is converted to the compound of formula I wherein R3R6N = R2NH. One preferred method of isolation is to evaporate the solvent under vacuum and then prepare the hydrochloride salt of the compound of formula I by adding in hydrochloric acid in methanol. The hydrochloride salt can be easily isolated by filtration.<br>
In the preparation of a compound of formula I wherein the R2NH2 used is not the same as R3R6NH, the acyl imidazole intermediate A is prepared in the same manner as above, and then reacted with a solution of R3R6NH2 to give the amide intermediate<br><br>
C. A solution of RNH2 in alcohol is added and the mixture is refluxed in a similar manner above to give a compound of formula I. The product can be isolated by traditional means. Experimental procedure for this method can be found in example 5 below.<br>
The 3-benzyl alcohol protective group (compound of formula I wherein R5 = CH2Ph) can be removed by hydrogenation reaction or by acid. Procedures for the removal of protective group can be found in Greene, T.W., in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1981.<br>
The starting materials required in this process are commercially available in kilogram to metric ton quantities. Allomaltol is prepared from the zinc reduction of 2-chlorokojic acid. The literature reported the use of excess thionyl chloride for the preparation of 2-chlorokojic acid. The reaction is heterogeneous and the procedure is not amenable to large-scale synthesis and manufacture. However, 2-chlorokojic acid can be prepared from kojic acid using 1 to 1.2 equivalent thionyl chloride in an inert solvent. The preferred inert solvent is acetonitrile and the product is easily isolated by filtration.<br>
The above description details a general method for the conversion of compound III to II then to compound I.<br>
The present invention will be more fully understood by the following examples which illustrate the invention, but are not considered limiting to the scope of the invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
Preparation of Chlorokojic acid<br>
A 2-litre 3-neck round bottom flask was equipped with a mechanical stirrer. The flask was charged with kojic acid (0.25 kg, 1.759 mol) and 750 ml acetonitrile at 0°C. The kojic acid was insoluble in acetonitrile and stayed as a suspension. Thionyl chloride (140 ml, 1.919 mol) was added dropwise via a dropping funnel at ice bath<br><br>
temperature. The solid slowly dissolved to give a red clear solution. After 15 minutes, a white solid appeared. After 3 hrs at 0°C, the insoluble solid was filtered. The solid was filtered by suction filtration. The solid was mixed with water (0.5L) and then filtered. The acetonitrile mother liquor was reduced to 15% of the original volume and filtered. The solid was washed with water (200 ml) and then acetonitrile (50 ml). The combined solid was dried to constant weight (269 g, 95.2% yield). M.p. 166 -168°C [lit value 166 - 167°C]. 1H-NMR (DMSO-d6) 5: 4.66 (s, 2H, CH2CI), 6.57 (s, 1H, CH), 8.12 (s, 1H, CH), 9.3 (br. s, 1H, OH).<br>
Example 2<br>
Preparation of 3-(benzyloxy)-2-(hydroxymethyl)-6-methyl-4H-pyran-4-one Procedure I:<br>
