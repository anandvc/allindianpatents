				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a process for the removal of impurities and recovery of heat from the<br>
exothermic process for the conversion of oxygenates to light olefins.<br>
Light olefins have traditionally been produced through the process of steam or catalytic cracking.<br>
Because of the limited availability and high cost of petroleum sources, the cost of producing light<br>
olefins from such petroleum sources has been steadily increasing. Light olefins serve as feeds for the<br>
production of numerous chemicals. As the emerging economies of the Third World strain toward<br>
growth and expansion, the demand for light olefins will increase dramatically.<br>
The search for alternative materials for Ught olefin production has led to the use of oxygenates<br>
such as alcohols and, more particularly, to the use of methanol, ethanol, and higher alcohols or their<br>
derivatives. These alcohols may be produced by fermentation or from synthesis gas. Synthesis gas can<br>
be produced from natural gas, petroleum liquids, and carbonaceous materials including coal, recycled<br>
plastics, municipal wastes, or any organic material. Thus, alcohol and alcohol derivatives may provide<br>
non-petroleum based routes for the production of olefin and other related hydrocarbons.<br>
Molecular sieves such as microporous crystalline zeolite and non-zeolitic catalysts, particularly<br>
silicoaluminophosphates (SAPO), are known to promote the conversion of oxygenates to hydrocarbon<br>
mixtures. The process may be generally conducted in the presence of one or more diluents which may<br>
be present in the oxygenate feed in an amount between 1 and 99 molar percent, based on the total<br>
number of moles of all feed and diluent components fed to the reaction zone (or catalyst). US-A-<br>
4,861,938 and US-A-4,677,242 particularly emphasize the use of a diluent combined with the feed to<br>
the reaction zone to maintain sufficient catalyst selectivity toward the production of light olefin •<br>
products, particularly ethylene.<br>
The conversion of oxygenates to olefins takes place at a relatively high temperature, generally<br>
higher than 250°C, preferably higher than 300°C. In the conversion of oxygenates to olefins, as<br>
significant amount heat is released in the highly exothermic reaction. Because the reactor effluent<br>
typically is at a higher temperature than the temperature of feedstock, many methods and schemes have<br>
been proposed to manage the heat of reaction generated from the process in order to avoid problems in<br>
the operation of the process. Processes are sought which effectively use the heat of reaction which was<br>
transferred to the reactor effluent to avoid operating problems while reducing the overall utility<br>
2<br>
consumption in the conversion of the oxygenate feedstock to produce light olefins and while<br>
minimizing the production of waste streams from the process.<br>
As opposed to conventional naphtha cracking process for the production of light olefins, in the<br>
present invention, the light olefins are produced by the catalytic conversion of an oxygenate, which<br>
also produces one mole of water for every mole of oxygenate converted. When the oxygenate is<br>
converted in the presence of a non-zeoiitic molecular sieve such as SAPO-34 or SAPO-17, there is<br>
essentially no heavy hydrocarbon phase formed. Furthermore, the present invention is carried out in a<br>
fluidized bed reactor which can result in the carryover of catalyst fines from the fluidized bed reactor in<br>
the reactor effluent stream. Therefore, quench schemes are sought which recover the heat of reaction<br>
from the reactor effluent, while minimizing the production of aqueous waste streams.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a process for converting an oxygenate to light olefins with<br>
improved heat recovery from reactor effluent streams and improved waste recovery which minimizes<br>
overall utility requirements. In the present process, the reactor effluent is quenched with an aqueous<br>
stream in a two-stage process to facilitate the separation of hydrocarbon gases from any entrained<br>
catalyst fines, remove water and any heavy byproducts such as C6+ hydrocarbons. In addition, the<br>
process of the present invention avoids the previously unknown problem of the build up of corrosive<br>
materials, particularly organic acids such as acetic, formic and propanoic acid in the operation of a<br>
conventional single column quench system. It was discovered that the reactor effluent can contain<br>
small amounts of acetic acid which could build up in conventional quench process schemes. According<br>
to the present invention, the reactor effluent is first passed to a first stage quench tower wherein the<br>
reactor effluent is contacted with a relatively pure aqueous stream and a neutralizing agent, inttoduced<br>
at the top of the quench tower, to provide a hydrocarbon vapor sdream and a first stage bottoms stream<br>
or waste water stream. A portion of the waste water stream withdrawn from the bottom of the quench<br>
tower is recycled to the quench tower at a point above where the reactor effluent is introduced to die<br>
quench tower. In the process of the present invention, the waste water stream produced from the first<br>
Stage quench tower is a much smaller drag stream than would be produced by a single quench tower<br>
and the waste water stream of the present invention comprises heavy organic oxygenates and<br>
byproducts, such as high molecular weight alcohols and ketones, and neutralized organic acid<br>
3<br>
components, in addition to any carryover of catalyst fines. Heat integration with the reactor feedstream<br>
at the particular points in the process with the hydrocarbon vapor stream withdrawn from the quench<br>
tower and with the product water from the bottom of the water stripper provide improved overall heat<br>
recovery from the reactor and provide improved operating stabihty for the overall process.<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention is a process using a two-stage quench for recovering<br>
heat and removing impurities from a reactor effluent stream withdrawn from a fluidized exothermic<br>
reaction zone. The process comprises the steps of passing a preheated feedstream comprising an<br>
oxygenate to an intercondenser to at least partially vaporize the preheated feedstream by indirect heat<br>
exchange to provide a partially vaporized feedstream. The partially vaporized feedstream is passed to a<br>
feed vaporizer to fully vaporize the partially vaporized feedstream to provide a vaporized feedstream.<br>
The vaporized feedstream is passed to a feed side of a feed superheater having a feed side and an<br>
effluent side to raise the vaporized feedstream to effective conversion conditions by indirect heat<br>
exchange with a reactor effluent stream to provide a superheated feedstream. The superheated<br>
feedstream is passed to the fluidized exothermic reaction zone and therein the superheated feedstream<br>
is contacted with a particulate catalyst at conversion conditions to at least partially convert the<br>
oxygenate to produce the reactor effluent stream comprising light olefins, impurities, water and catalyst<br>
particles. The reactor effluent stream is passed to the effluent side of the feed superheater to cool the<br>
reactor effluent stream to provide a desuperheated vapor effluent stream. The desuperheated vapor<br>
effluent stream is passed to a first stage tower of a two-stage quench zone comprising the first stage<br>
tower and a second stage tower. An overhead stream comprising the light olefins and a first stage<br>
bottoms stream comprising impurities, catalyst particles, and water are recovered from the first stage<br>
tower. A first portion of the first stage bottoms stream and a neutralization stream are retumed to an<br>
upper portion of the first stage tower. At least a second portion of the first stage bottoms stream is<br>
withdrawn from the process as a drag stream. The overhead stream or at least a portion of the first stage<br>
bottoms stream is passed to the intercondenser to cool the overhead stream or the bottoms stream by<br>
indirect heat exchange with the preheated feedstream to provide a cooled overhead stream or a cooled<br>
bottoms stream. The overhead stream is passed to the second stage tower to separate the light olefins<br>
and water to provide a vapor product stream comprising light olefins and a purified water stream. A i<br>
first portion of the purified water stream is retumed to the upper portion of the first stage tower, a<br>
second portion of the purified water stream is cooled in a product heat exchanger to provide a cooled<br>
purified water stream, and the cooled purified water stream is retumed to an upper portion of the<br>
4<br>
•<br>
second stage tower. A third portion of the purified water stream is passed to a water stripper column to<br>
provide a water stripper overhead stream and a highly purified water stream. A feedstream is preheated<br>
in a feed preheater by indirect heat exchange with the highly purified water stream to produce the<br>
preheated feedstream.<br>
In a further embodiment, the present invention is a two-stage quench tower process for<br>
removing impurities from a superheated reactor effluent stream withdrawn from an oxygenate<br>
conversion complex. The process comprises the steps of passing the superheated reactor effluent stream<br>
comprising light olefin, water, and organic acids to a feed/effluent exchanger to desuperheat the<br>
superheated reactor effluent stream by indirect exchange with a vaporized feedstream to provide a<br>
desuperheated stream. The desuperheated stream is passed to a first tower of a two-stage quench zone<br>
containing a first tower and a second tower. The desuperheated stream is contacted in an upper portion<br>
of the first tower with a neutralized water stream to condense at least a portion of the water to provide a<br>
first stage bottoms stream comprising water and neuttalized organic acids and a first stage overhead<br>
sdream comprising light olefins and water. The first stage overhead stream is passed to the second<br>
tower and is therein contacted with a cooled purified water stream to provide a light olefin product<br>
stream and a purified water stream. A first portion of the purified water stream is cooled to provide the<br>
cooled purified water stream. A second portion of the purified water stream is passed to a water stripper<br>
column to provide a high purity water stream and a sttipper overhead stream. The stripper overhead<br>
stream is admixed with the first stage overhead stream, and the first stage overhead stream is cooled<br>
prior to passing die first stage overhead stream to the second stage tower, or a second portion of the<br>
purified water stream is passed to a water stripper to provide a high purity water stream and a stripper<br>
overhead stream, a portion of the first stage bottoms stream is cooled and admixed with a neutralization<br>
stream and a third portion of the purified water stream to provide the neuttalized water stream. A fourtii<br>
portion of the purified water stream is returned to the first tower.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention comprises a process for the catalytic conversion of a feedstock comprising one<br>
or more aliphatic hetero compounds comprising alcohols, halides, mercaptans, sulfides, amines, ethers,<br>
and carbonyl compounds or mixtures thereof to a hydrocarbon product containing light olefinic<br>
products, i.e., C2, C3 and/or C4 olefins. The feedstock is contacted with a silicoaluminophosphate<br>
molecular sieve at effective process conditions to produce light olefins. Silicoaluminophosphate<br>
molecular sieves which produce light olefins are generally employable in the instant process. The<br>
preferred silicoaluminophosphates are those described in US-A-4,440,871. Silicoaluminophosphate<br>
molecular sieves employable in the instant process are more fully described hereinafter.<br>
In the instant process the feedstream comprises an oxygenate. As used herein, the term<br>
"oxygenate" is employed to include alcohols, ethers, and carbonyl compounds (aldehydes, ketones,<br>
carboxylic acids, and the Uke). The oxygenate feedstock preferably contains from 1 to 10 carbon atoms<br>
and, more preferably, contains from 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Suitable reactants include lower straight or<br>
branched chain alkanols, and their unsaturated counterparts. Representatives of suitable oxygenate<br>
compounds include methanol, dimethyl ether, ethanol, diediyl ether, methylethyl ether, formaldehyde,<br>
dimethyl ketone, acetic acid, and mixtures thereof.<br>
In accordance with the process of the present invention, an oxygenate feedstock is catalytically<br>
converted to hydrocarbons containing aliphatic moieties such as — but not limited to — methane,<br>
ethane, ethylene, propane, propylene, butylene, and limited amounts of other higher aliphatics by<br>
contacting the aliphatic hetero compound feedstock with a preselected catalyst. A diluent is required to<br>
maintain the selectivity of the catalyst to produce light olefins, particularly ethylene and propylene. The<br>
use of steam as the diluent provides certain equipment cost and thermal efficiency advantages. The [<br>
phase change between steam and liquid water can be employed to advantage in transferring heat<br>
between the feedstock and the reactor effluent, and the separation of the diluent from the product f<br>
requires simple condensation of the water to separate the water from the hydrocarbons. Ratios of 1<br>
mole of feed to 0.1-5 moles of water have been disclosed.<br>
The oxygenate conversion process of the present invention is preferably conducted in the vapor<br>
6<br>
phase such that the oxygenate feedstock is contacted in a vapor phase in a reaction zone with a<br>
molecular sieve catalyst at effective conversion conditions to produce olefinic hydrocarbons, i.e., an<br>
effective temperature, pressure, WHSV and, optionally, an effective amount of diluent, correlated to<br>
produce olefinic hydrocarbons. The process is affected for a period of time sufficient to produce the<br>
desired light olefin products. The oxygenate conversion process is effectively carried out over a wide<br>
range of pressures, including autogenous pressures. At pressures between 0.001 atmospheres (0.76 torr)<br>
and 1000 atmospheres (760,000 torr), the formation of light olefin products will be affected although<br>
the optimum amount of product will not necessarily form at all pressures. The preferred pressure is<br>
between 0.01 atmospheres (7.6 torr) and 100 atmospheres (76,000 torr). More preferably, the pressure<br>
will range from 1 to 10 atmospheres. The pressures referred to herein for the process are exclusive of<br>
the inert diluent, if any, that is present and refer to the partial pressure of the feedstock as it relates to<br>
oxygenate compounds and/or mixtures thereof. The temperature which may be employed in the<br>
oxygenate conversion process may vary over a wide range depending, at least in part, on the selected<br>
molecular sieve catalyst. In general, the process can be conducted at an effective temperature between<br>
200° and 700°C.<br>
In the oxygenate conversion process of the present invention, it is preferred that the catalysts<br>
have relatively small pores. Preferably, the small pore catalysts have a substantially uniform pore<br>
structure, e.g., substantially uniformly sized and shaped pore with an effective diameter of less than 5<br>
Angstroms. Suitable catalyst may comprise non-zeolitic molecular sieves and a matrix material.<br>
Non-zeolitic molecular sieves include molecular sieves which have the proper effective pore<br>
size and are embraced by an empirical chemical composition, on an anhydrous basis, expressed by the<br>
empirical formula:<br>
(ELxAlyPz)02<br>
where EL is an element selected from the group consisting of silicon, magnesium, zinc, kon, cobalt, '<br>
nickel, manganese, chromium and mixtures thereof, x is the mole fraction of EL and is at least 0.005, y<br>
is the mole fraction of Al and is at least 0.01, z is the mole fraction of P and is at least 0.01 and x + y +<br>
z = 1. When EL is a mixture of metals, x represents the total amount of the element mixture present. A<br>
preferred embodiment of the invention is one in which the element (EL) is silicon (usually referred to<br>
as SAPO). The SAPOs which can be used in the instant invention are any of those described in US-A-<br>
7<br>
•<br>
•<br>
4,440,871; US-A-5,126,308, and US-A-5,191,141 and include the SAPO-34 and SAPO-17.<br>
The preferred oxygenate conversion catalyst may be, and preferably is, incorporated into solid<br>
particles in which the catalyst is present in an amount effective to promote the desired hydrocarbon<br>
conversion. In one aspect, the solid particles comprise a catalytically effective amount of the catalyst<br>
and at least one matrix material, preferably selected from the group consisting of binder materials, filler<br>
materials, and mixtures thereof to provide a desired property or properties, e.g., desired catalyst<br>
dilution, mechanical strength, and the like to the solid particles. Such matrix materials are often, to<br>
some extent, porous in nature and may or may not be effective to promote the desired hydrocarbon<br>
conversion. If matrix materials, e.g., binder and/or filler materials, are included in the catalyst<br>
composition, the non-zeolitic molecular sieves preferably comprise 1 to 99 percent, more preferably 5<br>
to 90 percent and still more preferably 10 to 80 percent, by weight of the total composition.<br>
During the oxygenate conversion reaction coke, is deposited on the catalyst. The coke has the<br>
effect of reducing the number of active sites on the catalyst which thereby affects the extent of the<br>
conversion. During the conversion process a portion of the coked catalyst is withdrawn from the<br>
reaction zone and regenerated to remove at least a portion of the carbonaceous material and returned to<br>
the oxygenate conversion reaction zone. Depending upon the particular catalyst and conversion, it can<br>
be desirable to substantially remove the carbonaceous material e.g., to less than 1 weight percent, or<br>
only partially regenerate the catalyst, e.g., to from 2 to 30 weight percent carbon.<br>
The oxygenate conversion process of the instant invention will be further illustrated in terms of<br>
a methanol-to-olefin (MTO) process which produces light olefins including ethylene and propylene<br>
from methanol. The reaction products which are withdrawn from the MTO reactor must be cooled and<br>
separated from water, a byproduct of the conversion, in a quench tower before the olefin products are<br>
recovered. In the quench tower, most of the water is condensed and the light hydrocarbons and light<br>
oxygenates are removed from the top of the quench tower as an overhead stream and the water is<br>
removed from the bottom of the quench tower. Water removed from the quench tower comprises some<br>
dissolved Ught hydrocarbons and heavy byproducts including heavy oxygenates including alcohols and<br>
ketones which have a normal boiling point greater than or equal to water and which must be removed<br>
by stripping the water heavy byproducts with light gases such as steam or nitrogen. The feedstream<br>
passed to an MTO reactor can be refined methanol (essentially pure), or raw methanol containing water<br>
comprising up to 30 weight percent water. The feedstream is heated and vaporized prior to being<br>
8<br>
charged to the fluidized bed MTO reactor. This requires a considerable amount of energy. Therefore, it<br>
is necessary to recover as much as energy of the reactor effluent and use it to heat and vaporize the<br>
feedstream. However, water is substantially the only condensation product in the quench tower. Thus,<br>
the operating temperatures within the quench tower closely approach the bubble/dew point of pure<br>
water at the operating pressure. Although methanol and water have a boiling point differential of over<br>
16°C (60°F), there is a difference in operating pressure between the methanol vaporization and the<br>
water condensation stages. This differential is due to the pressure drop through heat exchangers, the<br>
MTO reactor, piping, etc. This pressure differential results in closing the difference between the feed<br>
vaporization and product condensation temperatures, making meaningful heat exchange difficult. The<br>
presence of any water in the methanol feed, depresses the boiling point curve and exacerbates the<br>
problem. Because it is difficult to completely vaporize the feedstream using only indirect heat<br>
exchange between the feedstream and the reactor effluent, a considerable amount of external heat<br>
provided by heating the feedstream with steam is required to insure that the feedstream is fully<br>
vaporized prior to introducing the feedstream to the reaction zone. The reaction zone can comprise<br>
either a fixed bed or a fluidized reaction zone, but a fluidized reaction zone is preferred.<br>
In the operation of conventional quench systems, essentially all of the water withdrawn from die<br>
bottom of the quench tower is contaminated and must undergo further treatment before it can be<br>
returned to the process and the pumparound is cooled by indirect heat exchange with the feedstream.<br>
The present invention significantiy reduces the treatment requirement for quench tower bottoms,<br>
provides purified water for immediate process to reduce the overall utility requirements of the process,<br>
and reduces the steam required to fully vaporize the feedstream. In the present invention, the reactor<br>
effluent is desuperheated and passed to a first stage quench tower. In one embodiment, a hydrocarbon<br>
vapor stream, comprising Ught olefins and water, is withdrawn from the top of the first stage quench<br>
tower and heat exchanged indirectly in an intercondenser with a portion of the feedstream to cool or at<br>
least partially condense the hydrocarbon vapor stream and provide a portion of the heat of the reaction<br>
to heat the feedstream. The subsequently cooled or at least partially condensed hydrocarbon vapors are<br>
passed to a second stage separation tower, or product separator, to further reduce the amount of water<br>
in the hydrocarbon vapor stream. A Ught olefin vapor stream is recovered from die top of the second<br>
stage separation tower, and a relatively pure aqueous stream, or purified water stream, is recovered<br>
from the bottom of die second stage separation tower. A portion of the purified water stream is returned<br>
to die first stage quench tower and the remaining portion is passed to a water stripper zone wherein any<br>
9<br>
remaining oxygenates such as dimethyl ether and methanol and small amounts of light hydrocarbons<br>
such as propane are removed from the purified water stream as a stripper overhead stream, and a high<br>
purity product water stream is removed from the bottom of the water stripper zone. The stripper<br>
overhead stream is combined with the hydrocarbon vapors withdrawn from the top of the first stage<br>
quench tower prior to the exchange with die feedstream portion. The present invention may include<br>
either an intercooler in the form of the intercondenser as described herein above to indirecdy exchange<br>
heat between a preheated feedstream and an overhead stream withdrawn from the first stage quench<br>
tower of the two-stage quench system, or include an intercooler which indirectly exchanges heat<br>
between a preheated feedstream and that portion of the bottom of the first stage quench tower which is<br>
cooled and returned to the first stage quench tower as a first stage pumparound stream. These schemes<br>
are shown in FIG. 2 and FIG. 3, respectively. In both schemes, a portion of the water in the reactor<br>
effluent stream is condensed and removed from the process from the bottom of the first stage quench<br>
tower as a relatively small drag stream comprising impurities, catalyst fines, and neutralized organic<br>
acids. In both schemes, the drag stream withdrawn from the first stage tower is less than 20 weight<br>
percent of the total recovered water which is the combination of the drag stream and the net, or highly<br>
purified water removed from the water stripper column. Preferably, the drag stream withdrawn from<br>
the first stage tower bottoms stream comprises at least 5 weight percent and less than 15 weight percent<br>
of the total recovered water; and more preferably, the drag stream withdrawn from the first stage tower<br>
bottoms stream comprises less than 10 weight percent of the total recovered water. In both schemes it<br>
was discovered that organic acids such as acetic acid, formic acid, and propanoic acid were present in<br>
the reactor effluent stream and that these organic acids could be neutralized by the injection of a<br>
neutraUzation material into the first stage pumparound stream. In this matter, any organic acid is<br>
neutralized and removed in the drag stream as a dissolved salt. By removing the acid at this point in the<br>
process, corrosion and fouUng problems diroughout the remainder of the product recovery train are<br>
mitigated at an early point in the process scheme. It is preferable that the neutralization material<br>
comprises caustic, although ammonia or amines or mixtures thereof can be employed.<br>
The scheme illustrated in FIG. 2 which includes an intercondenser offers the greatest energy<br>
savings. An unexpected advantage of the FIG. 2 scheme which employs the intercondenser form of<br>
intercooler is that the retum of the purified water to the first stage quench tower and the drag stream are<br>
de-coupled. This de-coupling allows the drag stiream flow in line 25 (FIG. 2) to be independentiy<br>
controlled to adjust of the quality of the purified water produced from the second stage tower or<br>
10<br>
product separator 46 (FIG. 2), Thus, the scheme shown in FIG. 2 permits the greatest flexibility in<br>
process operation to control the removal of impurities and water from the hydrocarbon product.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention improves the energy-efficiency of the overall process by ensuring<br>
that the indirect heat exchange between die reactor effluent and the feedstream takes place in a<br>
condensing vapor/boiUng liquid exchanger which provides the maximum overall transfer between these<br>
streams in the feed superheater, thereby reducing the considerable steam requirement and totally<br>
vaporizing the feedstream prior to entering the reactor.<br>
An altemative method of vaporizing a portion of the feedstream comprises passing a portion of<br>
the feedstream to the water stripping column and withdrawing a portion of the water stripper overhead<br>
stream comprising the vaporized oxygenate and passing a portion of the water stripper overhead stream<br>
to the exothermic reaction zone.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates the prior art approach to quenching the fluidized reactor effluent from the<br>
oxygenate conversion process. An example of such an approach is disclosed in publication WO<br>
99/55650. With reference to FIG. 1, the reactor effluent in line 1 is passed to a feed/effluent exchanger<br>
11 to indirectiy transfer a portion of the heat of reaction from the reactor effluent to the feedstock<br>
charged to the reactor to provide a cooled reactor effluent stream in line 2. The cooled reactor effluent<br>
stream in line 2 is passed to the water quench tower 12 to provide an olefinic overhead stream in line 3<br>
and an aqueous stream in line 4. A portion of the aqueous stream in line 5 is withdrawn via lines 4 and<br>
5 as an aqueous waste stream, and a portion of the aqueous stream in line 4 is passed via line 6 to a<br>
cooler 13 to provide a cooled pumparound stream in line 7 which is remmed to the water quench tower<br>
12 at a point above the point where the reactor effluent stream in line 2 was introduced.<br>
The two-stage quench process of the present invention is illustrated in FIG. 2 wherein a reactor<br>
effluent stream in line 20 at reactor effluent conditions including a temperature ranging from 250° to<br>
550°C is passed to a feed superheater, or feed/effluent exchanger 40 to cool the reactor effluent stream<br>
to provide a cooled reactor effluent stream in line 21. The cooled reactor effluent stream in line 21 is<br>
introduced to a first stage quench tower 42 having an upper portion 42a and a lower portion 42b. In the<br>
first stage quench tower 42, the cooled reactor effluent stream in line 21 which is introduced in the<br>
lower portion 42b of the first stage quench tower is contacted with a pumparound stream introduced in<br>
11<br>
line 24' to produce a first stage overhead stream in line 26 withdrawn from the upper portion 42a of the<br>
first stage quench tower and comprising a reduced amount of water relative to the cooled reactor<br>
effluent stream. An aqueous stream, or first stage quench tower bottoms stream, (comprising water,<br>
impurities, oxygenates, and catalyst fines) in line 23 is withdrawn from the lower portion 42b of the<br>
first stage quench tower 42. At least a portion of the aqueous stream is withdrawn from the process via<br>
line 23 and line 25 as an aqueous waste stream, or a drag stream, and passed for further treatment to a<br>
water treatment zone (not shown). The impurities in the drag stream include neutralized acids (organic<br>
salts). The neutraUzed acids result from the injection of an effective amount of a neutralizing stream in<br>
line 47 into the pumparound stream in line 24 to neutraUze organic acids to prevent corrosion and<br>
fouUng in the first and second stage quench towers. The drag stream, or the aqueous waste stream,<br>
comprises the majority of the impurities and catalyst fines, now concentrated into a small drag stream<br>
which comprises between 5 and 10 weight percent of the total recovered water. The remaining portion<br>
of the aqueous stream in line 23 is returned to the first stage quench tower 42 via lines 24 and 24' as the<br>
pumparound stream. The first stage overhead stream in Une 26 is passed via lines 26 and 26' to an<br>
intercondenser 45 wherein the first stage overhead stream is cooled by indirect heat exchange to<br>
provide a cooled first stage overhead stream in line 22. A water stripper overhead stream in line 31'<br>
which is essentially all vapor is withdrawn from a water stripper column (not shown) and admixed with<br>
the first stage overhead stream in line 26 prior to passing the first stage overhead stream to the<br>
intercondenser 45 via lines 26 and 26'.<br>
The coohng of the first stage overhead stream in line 26' and the reactor effluent stream in line<br>
20 is provided by a novel heat exchange sequence which is only made possible by the present<br>
invention. Accordingly, a preheated feedstream in line 39 comprising an oxygenate and up to 30 weight<br>
percent water is passed to a feed side of the intercondenser 45 to cool the first stage overhead stream in<br>
line 26' by indirect heat exchange with the preheated feedstream in line 39 to provide a partially<br>
vaporized feedstream in Une 37 and the cooled first stage overhead stream in line 22. The partially<br>
vaporized feedstream in line 37 is passed to a feed vaporizer 46 to essentially fully vaporize the<br>
feedstream and produce a vaporized feedstream in line 37'. The vaporized feedstream in line 37' is<br>
passed to the feed superheater 40. The feed superheater 40 is a preferably a vertical exchanger having a<br>
feed side and an effluent side. In the feed superheater 40, the reactor effluent stream in line 20, a<br>
superheated vapor stream, is indirectly heat exchanged with a fully vaporized feedstream in line 37' to<br>
desuperheat the reactor effluent stream and to superheat the feedstream prior to passing die superheated<br>
12<br>
feedstream in line 25 to the oxygenate conversion zone (not shown in FIG. 2).<br>
The cooled first stage overhead stream in line 22 is passed to a second stage tower, or product<br>
separator 46, having an upper separation zone 46a and a lower separation zone 46b, the product<br>
separator providing a second-stage overhead stream comprising Ught olefins in line 27 and a purified<br>
water stream comprising less than 10,000 ppm-wt oxygenates in Une 28. Following conventional water<br>
stripping in a water stripper column to strip oxygenates from the purified water stream to provide a<br>
highly purified water stream, the highly purified water stream comprises less than 500 ppm-wt<br>
oxygenates, and more preferably, after conventional water stripping, the highly purified water stream<br>
comprises between 10 and 100 ppm-wt oxygenates. At least a portion of die purified water stream is<br>
returned to the first stage tower via lines 28 and 29 as a quench tower make up stream, and a portion of<br>
the purified water stream is withdrawn from the lower separation zone 46b via lines 30 and 31 as a net<br>
purified water stream. The net purified water stream in line 31 is passed to the water stripper column<br>
(not shown) and a water stripper overhead stream is returned in line 31' as described hereinabove. A<br>
second portion of die purified water stream is conducted via lines 30 and 32 as a first separator<br>
pumparound stream to a secondary heat exchanger 48 to produce a first cooled purified water stream in<br>
Une 34. The first cooled purified water stream is returned to the second-stage tower 46 at a point above<br>
the point where the first stage overhead stream in line 22 was introduced at the upper portion of the<br>
lower separation zone 46b. A side draw stream in line 35 is withdrawn from a lower portion of the<br>
upper separation zone 46a and passed to a tertiary heat exchanger 50 to provide a second cooled water<br>
stream, or second separator pumparound stream in line 36 which is returned to second-stage tower 46<br>
in the upper separation zone 46a. The secondary heat exchanger 48 can be a product heat exchanger in<br>
an olefin separation zone (not shown) wherein the purified water stream in Une 32 is cooled by indirect<br>
heat exchange to provide the first cooled purified water stream in line 34.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 3 which is an altemate embodiment of the present invention, the partial<br>
vaporization of the preheated feedstream is performed in an intercooler 84 which cools a portion of the<br>
first stage quench tower bottoms stream in Une 64 by indirect heat exchange with the preheated<br>
feedstream in line 94. According to FIG. 3, a reactor effluent stream in Une 60 is passed to a feed<br>
superheater 80 wherein the reactor effluent stream is desuperheated and passed in line 61 to a first stage<br>
quench tower 82. The first stage quench tower 82 is part of a two-stage quench zone comprising the<br>
first stage quench tower 82 and a second stage tower 86, or product separator. A purified water stream<br>
in line 67 is passed to an upper portion of the first stage quench tower 82 and an overhead stream in<br>
13<br>
line 62 is recovered. The overhead stream in line 62 comprises light olefins and water. A first stage<br>
bottoms stream in line 63 is removed from the bottom of the first stage quench tower 82. The first stage<br>
bottoms stream comprises impurities, catalyst particles, and water. A first portion of the first stage<br>
bottoms stream is withdrawn from the process as a drag stream in line 65. A second portion of the first<br>
stage bottoms stream is passed via lines 63 and 64 to an intercooler 84 which cools the second portion<br>
of the first stage bottoms stream by indirect heat exchange as described hereinabove to provide a<br>
cooled first stage bottoms stream in line 66. A neutraUzing stream in line 95 is injected into line 66 to<br>
neutralize organic acid impurities such as acetic, formic, and propanoic acids which were surprisingly<br>
discovered in the reactor effluent and converts the organic acids to organic salts. The neutralizing<br>
stream is selected from the group consisting of caustic, ammonia, and amines. The cooled first stage<br>
bottoms stream in line 66 and when required a second stage purified water stream in line 70 are<br>
admixed to provide the purified water stream in line 67 which is retumed to an upper portion of the<br>
first stage quench tower 82. The flow of the second stage purified water stream in line 70 is not a<br>
normal flow; it is only required when an insufficient amount of heat is removed by the intercooler 84.<br>
The overhead stream in line 62 is passed to the second stage tower 86, or product separator, and therein<br>
contacted with a cooled purified water stream in line 74 to further separate water from the first stage<br>
overhead stream to produce a light olefin product stream in line 68 and a purified water stream in line<br>
69. A first portion of the purified water stream in hne 69 is retumed to the first stage quench tower as<br>
described hereinabove via line 70. A second portion of the purified water stream is passed via lines 69,<br>
71, and 73 to a primary second stage exchanger 88 to provide the cooled purified water stream in Une<br>
74. The cooled purified water stream in line 74 is retumed to a lower portion of the second stage tower<br>
at a point above a point where the first stage overhead stream was introduced to the second stage tower<br>
86. A side draw stream in line 75 is withdrawn from the second stage tower 86 at a point above the<br>
return of Une 74 and passed to a secondary exchanger 90 to cool the side draw stream and provide a<br>
second cooled water stream in line 77. The second cooled water stream in line 77 is retumed to the top<br>
of the second stage tower. A third portion of the purified water stream in line 69 is withdrawn via lines<br>
69, 71, and 72 to a water stripping zone (not shown) wherein the purified water stream is stripped to<br>
produce a high purity water stream comprising less than 500 ppm-wt oxygenates. Preferably, the high<br>
purity water sdream comprises between 10 and 100 ppm-wt oxygenates. According to FIG. 3, the<br>
preheated feedstream in line 94 is passed to the intercooler 84 to cool the first stage bottoms stream and<br>
at least partially vaporize the feedstream to provide a partially vaporized feedstream in line 92. The<br>
14<br>
partially vaporized feedstream in line 92 is passed to a feed vaporizer 93 which substantially vaporizes<br>
the feedstream to provide a vaporized feedstream in line 92'. The vaporized feedstream in Une 92' is<br>
passed to the feed side of the feed superheater 80 to superheat the feedstream to produce a superheated<br>
feedstream in line 91, which can now be passed to die MTO reactor (not shown), and to desuperheat<br>
the reactor effluent stream in Une 60. The Ught olefin product stream in line 68 is passed to a product<br>
separation zone (not shown) for the separation of individual olefin products. The olefin products<br>
include ethylene, propylene, and butylenes.<br>
FIG. 4 represents and integration of die present invention as depicted in FIG. 2 with a complex<br>
for the production of propylene from a system to the conversion of oxygenates into light olefin<br>
products. Referring to FIG. 4, a feedstream in line 175 is passed to a feed preheater 234 to provide a<br>
preheated feedstream in line 140. The preheated feedstream in line 140 is passed to an intercondenser<br>
208 to partially vaporize the preheated feedstream to provide a partially vaporized feedstream in line<br>
141. The partially vaporized feedstream in line 141 is passed to a feed vaporizer 179 which<br>
substantially vaporizes the feedstream to provide a vaporized feedstream in line 178. The vaporized<br>
feedstream in line 178 is passed to a feed side of a feed superheater 204 to superheat the feedstream to<br>
provide a superheated feedstream in line 142 by indirect exchange with the reactor effluent stream in<br>
Une 143. The reactor effluent stream in line 143 is withdrawn from an oxygenate conversion reaction<br>
zone 202 which contains a fluidized catalyst which is periodically or continuously circulated in a<br>
conventional manner to the regeneration zone 200 to maintain the selectivity and the conversion<br>
desired. Reaction zone 202 is maintained at effective conditions for the conversion of the oxygenate to<br>
produce light olefin products. The reactor effluent stream comprises light olefins, water, impurities,<br>
unreacted oxygenates, and catalyst fines. In the feed superheater 204, tiie reactor effluent stream is<br>
desuperheated to produce a desuperheated vapor effluent stream in Une 144. The desuperheated vapor<br>
effluent stream in line 144 is passed to a first stage quench tower 206 of a two-stage quench zone<br>
containing the first stage quench tower 206 and a second stage tower or product separator 210. In the<br>
first stage quench tower 206, the desuperheated vapor effluent stream is contacted with a purified water<br>
stieam in line 149 which is introduced at the top, or upper portion of die first stage quench tower 206.<br>
A first stage overhead stream in line 145 is withdrawn from the first stage quench tower 206 and passed<br>
via lines 145 and 151 to an intercondenser 208 to provide a cooled first stage overhead stream in line<br>
152. The intercondenser 208 provides indirect heat transfer between die preheated feedstream in Une<br>
140 and the first stage quench tower overhead stream in Une 151 to partially vaporize the preheated<br>
15<br>
feedstream and cool the first stage overhead stream. A first stage bottoms stream comprising catalyst<br>
fines, impurities, and water is withdrawn from the first stage quench tower 206 via Une 146 and a<br>
portion of which is withdrawn as a drag stream in line 148. The drag stream in line 148 comprises from<br>
5 to 15 weight percent of the total recovered water which is the sum of the drag stream and the highly<br>
purified water stream in line 177 which is withdrawn from the water stripper column 214. The<br>
remaining portion of the first stage bottoms stream is injected with a neutralizing stream in line 180 and<br>
retumed to an upper portion of the first stage quench tower in line 147 as a quench pumparound stream.<br>
The cooled first stage overhead stream in line 152 is passed to the second stage tower 210, or product<br>
separator, to separate die light olefins from water to provide a vapor product stream in line 154<br>
comprising light olefins, and a purified water stream in line 153. A first portion of the purified water<br>
stream is retumed to the upper portion of the first stage quench tower via lines 153 and 149. A second<br>
portion of the purified water stream in line 153 is passed via line 171 to a product heat exchanger 232<br>
to provide a cooled purified water stream in line 172. The cooled purified water stream in line 172 is<br>
retumed to an upper portion of the second stage tower 210. A third portion of the purified water stream<br>
is passed via lines 153 and 153' to a water stripper column 214 to provide a water stripper overhead<br>
stream in line 150 and a highly purified water stream in line 170. The highly purified water stream in<br>
line 170 is passed to feed preheater 234 to further cool the highly purified water stream to provide a<br>
cooled highly purified water stream in Une 177 while simuhaneously preheating the feedstream in line<br>
175 by indirect exchange. The water stripper overhead stream in line 150 is admixed with the first stage<br>
overhead stream in line 145 prior to introducing the first stage overhead stream to the intercondenser<br>
208 via Une 151. The highly purified water stream in line 177 wUl have an oxygenate content less than<br>
500 ppm-wt. The highly purified water stream can be withdrawn for reuse anywhere in the process as<br>
pure water or treated further in a conventional molecular sieve adsorption process to further reduce the<br>
oxygenate content in a manner weU known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The vapor product stream in line 154 is passed to a series of steps to produce the individual<br>
light olefin products. Initially, the vapor product stream is passed to a compression zone 216 to provide<br>
a compressed olefin stream in line 155. The compressed olefin stream in Une 155 is passed to an<br>
oxygenate removal zone 218 for the removal of any unreacted oxygenates. The oxygenate removal<br>
zone 218 can comprise either a conventional absorption based process or a conventional adsorption<br>
process using a molecular sieve to selectively remove oxygenates. An essentially oxygenate-free<br>
stream is withdrawn from the oxygenate removal zone in Une 156 and passed to a caustic wash zone<br>
16 [<br>
I<br>
i<br>
I<br>
220 wherein the essentially oxygenate-free stream is contacted with an aqueous caustic solution to<br>
remove carbon dioxide. An essentially carbon dioxide free light olefin stream is withdrawn in line 157<br>
and passed to a dryer zone 222 for the removal of water. The dryer zone 222 comprises a conventional<br>
desiccant dryer system employing a molecular sieve. A dry olefinic product stream is withdrawn from<br>
the dryer zone in line 158 and passed to a conventional light olefin recovery zone which is illustrated<br>
by a deethanizer zone 224 wherein a stream comprising components with boiling points lower than<br>
propylene, or a propylene and heavier stream, is withdrawn from the deethanizer zone 224 in line 160<br>
and passed to further ethylene recovery (not shown). A propylene and heavier stream is withdrawn<br>
from the deethanizer zone and passed via Une 164 to a depropanizer zone 228. In the depropanizer zone<br>
228, a C3 hydrocarbon stream comprising propane and propylene is separated from a C4+ stream in<br>
line 165 having boiling points heavier than propane. The C4+ stream in line 165 is withdrawn for<br>
further recovery of butylenes. The C3 hydrocarbon stream is passed to a propane/propylene splitter<br>
reboiler 230 to separate a high purity propylene product (greater than 95 mole percent propylene) in<br>
line 166 from a propane stream in line 169. According to the present invention, the second portion of<br>
the purified water stream in line 171 is employed to heat the propane/propylene splitter reboiler 230, or<br>
product heat exchanger, thereby cooling die third portion of the purified water stream to provide the<br>
cooled purified water stream in line 172.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example I<br>
Column A of Table 1 shows the key process heat exchangers and specific energy inputs to a<br>
prior art complex which uses a single stage quench tower in the production of 1.2 metric tonnes per<br>
annum of light olefins by the conversion of a methanol feedstream. The key process heat exchangers<br>
include a feed preheater which heats the feed by indirect exchange with stripped waste water streams;<br>
an intercooler which exchanges heat between the preheated feedstream and the recirculated quench<br>
tower bottoms stream; and a feed superheater which exchanges heat with the reactor effluent. The heat<br>
input to the process includes a feed vaporizer to vaporize the feed prior to indirect heat exchange with<br>
the reactor effluent; a feed stripper reboiler which supplies heat for the separation of oxygenates from<br>
the quench tower bottoms stream; and, heat recovered from the use of a catalyst cooler in the reaction<br>
zone. The methanol feedstream comprises crude methanol having 82 weight percent methanol and 18<br>
17<br>
weight percent water. In the prior art scheme, the methanol feedstream is converted in a fluidized<br>
reaction zone over a SAPO-34 non-zeolitic catalyst at an operating pressure of 200 to 350 kPa (30 to 50<br>
psia) and a temperature of 450° to 480°C to produce a reactor effluent stream comprising an equal<br>
amount of ethylene and propylene. The prior art scheme requires an overall energy input of 150 gJoules<br>
(giga-Joules) per hour and for comparison purposes is shown as with relative energy requirement for<br>
the conventionally operated single column quench scheme as a value of 1.0.<br>

Example II<br>
The prior art scheme described with respect to column A of Table 1 was modified to include the<br>
two-stage quench scheme described with reference to FIG. 3. Column B of Table 1 shows the impact of<br>
the two-stage quench scheme with an intercooler (as described in reference to FIG. 3.) on the individual<br>
process exchangers and the overall energy requirements of the oxygenate conversion complex relative<br>
•<br>
to the prior art scheme of Example I. Although the two-stage quench scheme with the intercooler<br>
significantly reduces the amount of waste water to be treated, it requires a 4 percent increase in the total ;<br>
energy input to the process. Thus, a 90 percent reduction in the production of waste water is achieved, ;<br>
but there is no energy advantage for the change from a single column to a two-stage quench zone.<br>
Example III<br>
The prior art scheme of column A was again modified to correspond to the two-stage quench<br>
scheme of the present invention as disclosed in FIG. 2. Column C of Table illustrates the impact of the<br>
addition of the intercondenser to the two-stage quench scheme. The addition of the intercondenser to<br>
•<br>
the two-stage quench scheme achieves the 90 percent decrease in the waste water production, and in<br>
19<br>
addition results in a more overall energy efficient process. As shown by a comparison of the prior art<br>
scheme in column A and that of the present invention according to FIG. 2 as shown in column C, the<br>
total relative energy input shows an unexpected 17 percent advantage over the prior art for the scheme<br>
using the two-stage quench scheme with the intercondenser. It is beUeved that a portion of this<br>
advantage is achieved by using heat recovered from die first stage quench tower overhead stream to<br>
partially vaporize the preheated feedstream which reduced the need for external heat to fully vaporize<br>
the feedstream prior to the indirect heat exchange and improves the efficiency of the indirect heat<br>
exchange between the fully vaporized feedstream and the reactor effluent.<br>
Example IV<br>
The presence of water in the feedstream during the preheating, vaporizing, and superheating<br>
steps can have a profound influence on the total energy input to the process. Removal of the associated<br>
water will result in a significant improvement in the energy efficiency of the overall complex. Table 2<br>
shows a 50 percent energy advantage in the relative energy input between the process of the present<br>
invention for an essentially pure methanol feed (99.85 percent methanol) in column D over the prior art<br>
single quench column scheme as shown in column A. In order to achieve this advantage, the size of the<br>
intercondenser increases to more than twice the capacity of the intercondenser in column C of Table 1.<br>
Thus, there is an advantage to limit the amount of water in the crude methanol in the feedstream to a<br>
value between 0.001 and 30 weight percent to achieve the benefit of the present invention over the<br>
prior art.<br>

The present invention's use of the intercondenser decouples the drag stream and purified water recycle to the first stage quench tower. A comparison of the schemes of the present invention (B-D '<br>
corresponding to the columns B-D in Tables 1 and 2) with the single stage quench tower (A) of the j<br>
prior art is shown in Table 3 to illustrate the drag stream. In Table 3, the relative flow rates are<br>
expressed in weight fractions of the reactor effluent flow. The pumparound in the single stage quench<br>
tower and in the first stage quench tower ranged from 4:1 to 6:1. The drag stream withdrawal from the<br>
two-stage quench zone ranged from 0.04 to 0.05. In Cases B, C, and D, the stripped water now can be<br>
upgraded to boiler feed water quality because the higher boiling contaminants have been removed in<br>
the drag stream.<br>
