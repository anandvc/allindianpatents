To the invention belong all compounds having formula (I), racemates, mixtures of diastereomers and the individual steroisomers. Thus compounds in which the substltuents on potentially asymmetrical carbon atoms are in either the reconfiguration or the S-configuration belong to the invention.<br>
Also prodrugs, i.e. compounds which when administered to humans by any known route, are metabolised to compounds having formula (I), belong to the invention. Prodrugs are bioreversible derivatives of drug molecules used to overcome some barriers to the utility of the parent drug molecule. These barriers include, but are not limited to, solubility, permeability, stability, presystemic metabolism and targeting limitations (J. Stella, Trodrugs as therapeutic”, Expert Opin. Ther. Patents, 14(3), 277-280, 2004). In particular this relates to compounds with primary or secondary amino or hydroxy groups. Such compounds can be reacted with organic acids to yield compounds having formula (I) wherein an additional group is present which is easily removed after administration, for instance, but not limited to amidine, enamine, a Mannich base, a hydroxyl-methylene derivative, an 0-(acyloxymethylene carbamate) derivative, carbamate, ester, amide or enaminone. A pro-drug is an inactive compound, which when absorbed is converted into an active form (Medicinal Chemistry: Principles and Practice, 1994, BBN 0-85186-494-5, Ed.: F. D. King, p. 216).<br>
Due to the CB receptor activity the compounds according to the invention are suitable for use in the treatment of psychiatric disorders such as psychosis, anxiety, depression, attention deficits, memory disorders, cognitive disorders, appetite disorders, obesity, addiction, appetence, drug dependence and neurological disorders such as neurodegenerative disorders, dementia, dystonia, muscle spasticity, tremor, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, stroke, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, Huntington's disease, Tourette's syndrome, cerebral ischaemia, cerebral apoplexy, craniocerebral trauma, stroke, spinal cord injury, neuroinflamrnatory disorders, plaque sclerosis, viral encephalitis,<br>
demyelinisation related disorders, as well as for the treatment of pain disorders, including neuropathic pain disorders, and other diseases involving cannabinoid neurotransmission, including the treatment of septic shock, glaucoma, cancer, diabetes, emesis, nausea, asthma, respiratory diseases, gastrointestinal disorders, sexual disorders, gastric ulcers, diarrhoea and cardiovascular disorders.<br><br>
PHARMACOLOGICAL METHODS<br>
In vitro affinity for human cannabinoid CB1 receptors<br>
The affinity of the compounds of the invention for cannabinoid CBn receptors can be determined using membrane preparations of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells in which the human cannabinoid CB1 receptor is stably transfected in conjunction with [3H]CP-55,940 as radioligand. After incubation of a freshly prepared cell membrane preparation with the [3H]-Iigand, with or without addition of compounds of the invention, separation of bound and free ligand is performed by filtration over glassfiber filters. Radioactivity on the filter is measured by liquid scintillation counting.<br>
In vitro affinity for human cannabinoid CB2 receptors<br>
The affinity of the compounds of the invention for cannabinoid CB2 receptors can be determined using membrane preparations of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells in which the human cannabinoid CB2 receptor is stably transfected in conjunction with [3H]CP-55,940 as radioligand. After incubation of a freshly prepared cell membrane preparation with the [3H]-ligand, with or without addition of compounds of the invention, separation of bound and free ligand is performed by filtration over glassfiber filters. Radioactivity on the filter is measured by liquid scintillation counting.<br>
In vitro antagonism on human cannabinoid CB1 receptors<br>
In vitro CBi receptor antagonism can be assessed with the human CB1 receptor cloned in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. CHO cells are grown in a Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) culture medium, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Medium is aspirated and replaced by DMEM, without fetal calf serum, but containing [3HI-arach]donic acid and incubated overnight in a cell culture stove (5% CO2/95% air; 37 QC; water-saturated atmosphere). During this period [3H]-arachidonic acid is incorporated in membrane phospholipids. On the test day, medium is aspirated and cells are washed three times using 0.5 mL DMEM, containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Stimulation of the CB1 receptor by WIN 55,212-2 leads to activation of PLA followed by release of [3H]-arachidonic acid into the medium. This WIN 55,212-2-induced release is concentration-dependently<br>
antagonized by CB1 receptor antagonists. The CB1 antagonistic potencies of the test compounds are expressed as pA2 values.<br><br>
In vivo antagonism on human cannabinoid CBn receptors<br>
In vivo CB1 antagonism can be assessed with the CP-55,940-induced hypotension test in rat. Male normotensive rats (225-300 g; Harlan, Horst, The Netherlands) are anaesthetized with pentobarbital (80 mg/kg ip). Blood pressure is measured, via a cannula inserted into the left carotid artery, by means of a Spectramed DTX-plus pressure transducer (Spectramed B.V., Bilthoven, The Netherlands). After amplification by a Nihon Kohden Carrier Amplifier (Type AP-621G; Nihon Kohden B,V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands), the blood pressure signal is registered on a personal computer (Compaq Deskpro 386s), by means of a Po-Ne-Mah data-acquisition program (Po-Ne-Mah Inc., Storrs, USA). Heart rate is derived from the pulsatile pressure signal. All compounds are administered orally as a microsuspension in 1% methylcellulose 30 minutes before induction of the anesthesia which is 60 minutes prior to administration of the CB-i receptor agonist CP-55,940. The injection volume is 10 mL kg-1. After haemodynamic stabilization the CB-, receptor agonist CP-55,940 (0.1 mg kg”1 i.v.) is administered and the hypotensive effect established. (Wagner, JA ef a/., Hemodynamic effects of<br>
cannabinoids: coronary and cerebral vasodilation mediated by cannabinoid CB1 receptors. Ear. J. PhatrnacoL 2001, 423,203-210).<br>
This hypotension test can also be used to assess CB1 receptor agonistic effects of the compounds. Such CBi agonistic effects on blood pressure may be counteracted by a selective CB-, receptor antagonist such as rimonabant.<br>
Cannabinoid receptor agonistic or partial agonistic activity of compounds of the invention can be determined according to published methods, such as assessment of in vivo cannabimirnetic effects (Wiley, J. L et a!., J Pharmacol Exp. Ther. 2001,<br>
296, 1013).<br>
The compounds of the invention can be brought into forms suitable for administration by means of usual processes using auxiliary substances and/or liquid or solid carrier materials.<br>
Compounds of the present invention are generally administered as pharmaceutical compositions which are important and novel embodiments of the invention because of the presence of the compounds, more particularly specific compounds disclosed<br><br>
herein. Types of pharmaceutical compositions that may be used include but are not limited to tablets, chewable tablets, capsules, solutions, parenteral solutions, suppositories, suspensions, and other types disclosed herein or apparent to a person skilled in the art from the specification and general knowledge in the art.<br>

Alfahaloketones can be obtained by halogenation of the corresponding ketone. The reaction of affa-halo carbonyl compounds and thioamide can produce a wide range of thiazole derivatives. More in particular, condensation of alfa-bromoketones with ethyl thiooxamate provides (2-ethoxy-carbonyl)thiazoles of general formula (II).<br><br><br>
Compounds of formula (II) can be converted to the corresponding N-methoxy-N-methylamide (III) and subsequently reacted with an alkyliithium or aryl lithium reagent to give a compound of general formula (1), wherein X represents subgroup (i).<br>
Compounds of general formula (II) can be amidated with an amine of general formula R3R4NH into a compound of general formula (I) wherein X represents subgroup (if). Such amidations can be catalyzed by (CH3)3AL (For more information on aluminum-mediated conversion of esters to amides, see: J. I. Levin, E. Turos, S. M. Weinreb, Synth. Commun. (1982), 12, 989-993.)<br>
Alternatively, a compound having formula (II) is converted into the corresponding carboxylic acid and subsequently reacted with a so-called halogenating agent such as for example thionyl chloride (SOCI2). This reaction gives the corresponding carbonyl chloride that is subsequently reacted with a compound having formula R3R4NH wherein R3 and R4 have the meanings as described above. Alternatively, the ester group in (II) can be converted to the corresponding carboxylic acid. This carboxylic acid can be reacted with a compound having formula R3R4NH wherein R3 and R4 have the meanings as described hereinabove via activating and coupling methods such as formation of an active ester, or in the presence of a so-called coupling reagent, such as for example, DCC, HBTU, HOAT (N-hydroxy-7-azabenzotriazole), BOP, CIP (2-chloro-1,3-dimethyIimida2olinium hexafluoro-Dhosphate), PyAOP (7-azabenzotriazol-1-yloxytris(pyrroIidino)-phosphonium hexa-luorophosphate) and the like. (For more information on activating and coupling methods see a) M. Bodanszky, A. Bodanszky: The Practice of Peptide Synthesis, Springer-Verlag, New York, 1994; ISBN: 0-387-57505-7; b) K. Akaji et aL, Tetrahedron Lett. (1994), 35, 3315-3318; c) F. Albericio et al., Tetrahedron Lett. 1997), 38,4853-4856).<br>
According to these procedures the following compounds can be prepared. They are itended to further illustrate the invention in more detail, and therefore are not deemed to restrict the scope of the invention in any way.<br><br>

Hz, 3H), 1.28-1.40 (m, 4H), 1.66-1.76 (m, 2H), 2.93-3,00 (m, 2H), 4.00 (br s, 1H), 7,35-7.46 (m, 3H), 7.58-7.64 (m, 2H).<br>
Part D: To a magnetically stirred suspension of 5-(n-perrtyI)-4-phenyithiazole-2-carboxylic acid (1.18 g, 0.0043 mol) in anhydrous dichloromethane (35 ml) is successively added 7-aza-1-hydroxybenzotriazoie (HOAT) (1.46 gram, 0.0107 mol), 7-azabenzotriazoI-1-yioxytris(pyrroIidino)phosphonium hexafluorophos- phate (PyAOP) (5.59 gram, 0.0107 mol), diisopropylethyiamine (2.24 ml, 0.0129 mol) and aniline (0.98 ml, 0.0107 mol) and the resulting solution is stirred for 16 hours at room temperature. The resulting mixture is concentrated and purified by flash chromatography (silica gel / dichloromethane) to give N-pheny!-5-(n-pentyl)-4-phenylthiazole-2-carboxamide (0.89 gram, 59 % yield). 1H-NMR (400 MHz, CDCb): d<br><br><br>

Example 9<br>
Part A: 1-Bromo-1-phenylheptan-2-one (19.98 gram, 0.074 mol) and ethyl thiooxamate (15.0 gram, 0.112 mol) are dissolved in absolute ethanol (200 mL). The resulting mixture is heated at reflux temperature for 2 hours. After evaporation in vacuo the crude material is dissolved in a mixture of water and dichloromethane. The dichloromethane layer is separated and the water layer is extracted three times with dichloromethane. The collected organic layers are dried (MgSO4), filtered and concentrated. The resulting material is purified by column chromatography (silica gel<br><br>
Analogously were prepared:<br>
