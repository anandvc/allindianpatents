FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention, in general, relates to network and facsimile data transfer. More importantly, this invention relates to heterogeneous offline method for sending network and facsimile data.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
MFP supports different applications for transferring data like Fax, Scan to Email, and Scan to FTP, etc. When user wants to send fax data then user has to select fax application for transferring data using PSTN line. Similarly if user wants to send scanned data over the network then user needs to select appropriate network application which support network protocols like SMTP, FTP, SMB, etc. In this scenario only one session of fax, email or ftp is allowed; user can't use the machine for multiple fax/email session. User has to wait till previous session is complete.<br>
LIMITATIONS<br>
1.	Multiple session of one application can't be started.<br>
2.	If MFP is busy in sending fax data then user can't initiate another fax session.<br>
3.	User canâ€™t use other application communication channel for sending the data.<br>
2<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Transmitter MFP uses different communication channels to send data to destination MFP. Now we will provide document server, which will receive this data from these different channels and redirect the data to destination machine as per the communication protocol requested by the transmitter MFP. In this case, document server can queue the request from MFP.<br>
Suppose if one email session is in progress then user cannot send another email because email communication channel is busy. But in this proposed method transmitter MFP will take user request and through other free channel it sends the data to document server with job log information. This job log information will specify how the document server will forward that received data to destination machine.<br>
Accordingly, this invention explains a method for sending network and facsimile data comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	selecting an application through which the user wants to send data;<br>
(b)	checking if the selected application is adapted to send the said data;<br>
( c)	checking for the availability of a free communication channel if the selected<br>
application is busy;<br>
(d)	selecting a free communication channel for sending said data;<br>
(e)	creating a job information as per the user requirement;<br>
3<br><br>
(f) 	sending the said job information to a data server; and<br>
(g) 	reading the said job information  and sending the data to the required destination by the said data server.<br>
For transmitting a network data, an application network driver take the request from the application and sends the data on the network as per the application requested channel. The application which wants to send network data first checks the application channel for data transmission. If the said communication channel is busy then application searches other application free channel where if there is no free channel available then application reports error to the user. If the free channel is available then application will initiate the user request and send the data to document server with actual destination information as job log information. The document server parses the job log information from the application and send the data to requested destination.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS Figure 1 illustrates data transmission through different channels.<br>

Figure 2 illustrates check before starting new session.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates sending data when requested channels are busy.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates sending data when requested channel is busy through document<br>
server.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings.It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates data transmission through different channels Figure 1 shows how the different network embedded applications like Scan to Email, Scan to FTP, Scan to SMB. and Scan to HTTP/HTTPS etc allocate/define different channels (memory in/out buffer) for transmitting or receiving the network data. Network driver (Network Interface Card Driver) will use these channels for<br>
5<br><br>
corresponding application and execute appropriate control command or do bulk data transfer.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates check before starting new session.<br>
Figure 2 is the flow diagram which shows that application will first check the channel for executing the request. If the channel is busy then application will not execute the request otherwise it will execute request appropriately.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates sending data when requested channels are busy. Figure 3 explain how the proposed method will optimize the different channels for data transmission. Application which wants to use it channel for transmitting the data and if its channel is busy, then application will search for other free channels. If any other transmitting channel is free then application will use that channel to transmit the data to document server. After sending the data to document server, application will also send the actual destination information as a job log to server. Document server will then send the data to actual destination by using the job log.<br>
The flow chart figure 3 describes the exact working of the invention.<br>
â€¢	Selecting an application through which the user wants to send data.<br>
â€¢	Checking if the selected application is busy.<br>
6<br><br>
â€¢	If the selected application is not busy start sending data through the application.<br>
â€¢	If the selected application is busy then a check is made for the availability of a free communication channel.<br>
â€¢	If there is no free communication channel then the operation is terminated.<br>
â€¢	If there is a free channel, the said free channel is selected.<br>
â€¢	Then a job log information is created as per the user requirement.<br>
â€¢	Then the said job log information is send to the data server.<br>
â€¢	The data server reads the job log information and sends the data to the required destination.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates sending data when requested channel is busy through document<br>
server.<br>
Figure 4 shows how different channel can be used for data transmission. Network<br>
application can optimize the channel usage by checking the unused channel for<br>
transmission of its data.<br>
Embedded devices which have different network application for supporting different network protocol for data transmission can use this proposed method as follows:-<br>
1- For Transmitting a network data, application network driver (Network Interface<br>
card Driver) take the request from application and send the data on the<br>
network as per the application requested channel.<br>
7<br><br>
2-	Application which wants to send network data will first check its channel for data transmission.<br>
3-	If the channel is busy then application will search other application free channel. If there is no free channel available then application will report error to user.<br>
4-	If the free channel is available then application will initiate the user request and send the data to document server with actual destination information as a job log.<br>
5-	Document server is the pre-configured device server which will be use for transmitting a data as per the application job log. Document server will parse the job log information from the application and send the data to requested destination machine/user.<br>
The main objective of this method is to effectively utilize the different communication protocol provided by the machine. When requested communication protocol is busy then the machine will search for free communication protocol through which it can send the data to destination machine using document server. So in this case even the requested protocol is busy machine can still send the data to requested destination machine without user knowledge that it sending the data through different communication protocol.<br>
8<br><br>
ADVANTAGES<br>
1.	We can effectively use the entire communication channel supported by MFP.<br>
2.	User needs not to wait for communication channel to free for sending the data.<br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatus can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a microchip, microprocessor, handheld communication device, computer, rendering device or a multi function device.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart there from.<br>
