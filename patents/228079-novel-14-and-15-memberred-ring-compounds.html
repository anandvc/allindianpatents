suitable for pharmaceutical use. Salts and solvates of compounds of the invention which<br>
are suitable for use in medicine are those wherein the counterion or associated solvent<br>
40 is pharmaceutically acceptable. However, salts and solvates having non-<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable counterions or associated solvents are within the scope of<br><br><br>
WO 2004/101587<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/005083<br><br>
the present Invention, for example, for use as intermediates In the preparation of other<br>
compounds of the invention and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and solvates.<br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable derivative" as used herein means any<br>
5 pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate or prodrug, e.g. ester, of a compound of the<br>
invention, which upon administration to the recipient is capable of providing (directly or<br>
indirectly) a compound of the Invention, or an active metabolite or residue thereof. Such<br>
derivatives are recognizable to those skilled in the art, without undue experimentation.<br>
Nevertheless, reference is made to the teaching of Burger's Medicinal Chemistry and<br>
10 Drug Discovery, 5th Edition, Vol 1: Principles and Practice, which is incorporated herein<br>
by reference to the extent of teaching such derivatives. Preferred pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable derivatives are salts, solvates, esters, carbamates and phosphate esters.<br>
Particularly preferred pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives are salts, solvates and<br>
esters. Most preferred pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives are salts and esters, in<br>
15 particular salts.<br>
The compounds of the present Invention may be in the form of and/or may be<br>
administered as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. For a review on suitable salts see<br>

Typically, a pharmaceutical acceptable salt may be readily prepared by using a desired<br>
acid or base as appropriate. The salt may precipitate from solution and be collected by<br>
filtration or may be recovered by evaporation of the solvent. For example, an aqueous<br>
solution of an acid such as hydrochloric acid may be added to an aqueous suspension of<br>
25 a compound of formula (I) and the resulting mixture evaporated to dryness (lyophilised)<br>
to obtain the acid addition salt as a solid. Alternatively, a compound of formula (I) may<br>
be dissolved in a suitable solvent, for example an alcohol such as isopropanol, and the<br>
add may be added in the same solvent or another suitable solvent. The resulting acid<br>
addition salt may then be precipitated directly, or by addition of a less polar solvent such<br>
30 as diisopropyl ether or hexane, and isolated by filtration.<br>
Suitable addition salts are formed from inorganic or organic acids which form non-toxic<br>
salts and examples are hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, sulphate, blsulphate,<br>
nitrate, phosphate, hydrogen phosphate, acetate, trifluoroacetafe, maleate, malate,<br>
35 fumarate, lactate, tartrate, citrate, formate, gluconate, succinate, pyruvate, oxalate,<br>
oxaloacetate, trifluoroacetate, saccharate, benzoate, alkyl or aryl sulphonates (eg<br>
methanesulphonate, ethanesulphonate, benzenesulphonate or p-toluenesulphonate)<br>
and isethionate. Representative examples Include trifluoroacetate and formate salts, for<br>
example the bis or tris trifluoroacetate salts and the mono or diformate salts, in particular<br>
40 the tris trifluoroacetate salt and the diformate salt A further representative example of a<br>
formate salt is the tris formate salt.<br><br><br>

PCT/EP2004/005083<br><br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable base salts Include ammonium salts, alkali metal salts such<br>
as those of sodium and potassium, alkaline earth metal salts such as those of calcium<br>
and magnesium and salts with organic bases, including salts of primary, secondary and<br>
tertiary amines, such as isopropylamine, diethylamine, ethanolamine, trimethylamine,<br>
5 dicyclohexyl amine and N-methyl-D-glucamine.<br>
Compounds of the invention may have both a basic and an acidic centre may therefore<br>
be in the form of zwitterlons.<br>
10 Those skilled in the art of organic chemistry will appreciate that many organic<br>
compounds can form complexes with solvents in which they are reacted or from which<br>
they are precipitated or crystallized. These complexes are known as "solvates". For<br>
example, a complex with water Is known as a "hydrate". Solvates of the compound of<br>
the invention are within the scope of the invention. The salts of the compound of formula<br>
15 (I) may form solvates (e.g. hydrates) and the invention also includes all such solvates.<br>
The term "prodrug" as used herein means a compound which is converted within the<br>
body, e.g. by hydrolysis In the blood, into its active form that has medical effects.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs are descrlbed in T. Higuchi and V. Stella,<br>
20 "Prodrugs as Novel Delivery Systems", Vol. 14 of the ACS. Symposium Series, Edward<br>
B. Roche, ed., "Bloreversible Carriers in Drug Design", American Pharmaceutical<br>
Association and Pergamon Press, 1987, and in D. Fleisher, S. Ramon and H. Barbra<br>
"Improved oral drug delivery: solubility limitations overcome by the use of prodrugs",<br>
Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews (1996) 19(2) 115-130, each of which are incorporated<br>
25 herein by reference.<br>
Prodrugs are any covalently bonded carriers that release a compound of structure (I) In<br>
vivo when such prodrug is administered to a patient. Prodrugs are generally prepared by<br>
modifying functional groups in a way such that the modification is cleaved, either by<br>
30 routine manipulation or In vivo, yielding the parent compound. Prodrugs include, for<br>
example, compounds of this invention wherein hydroxy, amine or sulfhydryl groups are<br>
bonded to any group that, when administered to a patient, cleaves to form the hydroxy,<br>
amine or sulfhydryl groups. Thus, representative examples of prodrugs include (but are<br>
not limited to) acetate, formate and benzoate derivatives of alcohol, sulfhydryl and amine<br>
35 functional groups of the compounds of structure (I). Further, in the case of a carboxylic<br>
acid (-COOH), esters may be employed, such as methyl esters, ethyl esters, and the<br>
like. Esters may be active in their own right and/or be hydrolysable under in vivo<br>
conditions in the human body. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable In vivo hydrolysable<br>
ester groups include those which break down readily in the human body to leave the<br>
40 parent acid or its salt.<br><br><br>

5 asymmetric carbon atom. In the general formula (I) as drawn, the solid wedge shaped<br>
bond Indicates that the bond is above the plane of the paper. The broken bond indicates<br>
that the bond Is below the plane of the paper.<br>
It will be appreciated that the substituents on the macrollde may also have one or more<br>
10 asymmetric carbon atoms. Thus, the compounds of structure (I) may occur as individual<br>
enantiomers or diastereomers. Ail such isomeric forms are included within the present<br>
invention, including mixtures thereof.<br>
Where a compound of the invention contains an alkenyl group, cis (Z) and trans (E)<br>

of the compound of the invention and, where appropriate, the individual tautomeric forms<br>
thereof, together with mixtures thereof.<br>
Separation of diastereoisomers or cis and trans isomers may be achieved by<br>
20 conventional techniques, e.g. by fractional crystallisation, chromatography or H.P.L.C. A<br>
stereoisomerc mixture of the agent may also be prepared from a corresponding optically<br>
pure intermediate or by resolution, such as H.P.L.C., of the corresponding mixture using<br>
a suitable chiral support or by fractional crystallisation of the diastereoisomeric salts<br>
formed by reaction of the corresponding mixture with a suitable optically active acid or<br>
25 base, as appropriate.<br>
The compounds of structure (I) may be in crystalline or amorphous form. Furthermore,<br>
some of the crystalline forms of the compounds of structure (I) may exist as polymorphs,<br>
which are included in the present invention.<br>

The compounds of the Invention may be formulated for administration in any convenient<br>
15 way for use in human or veterinary medicine and the invention therefore includes within<br>
its scope pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of the invention adapted<br>
for use in human or veterinary medicine. Such compositions may be presented for use In<br>
a conventional manner with the aid of one or more suitable excipients, diluents and/or<br>
carriers. Acceptable excipients, diluents and carriers for therapetic use are well known<br>
20 in the pharmaceutical art, and are described, for example, in Remington's<br>
Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Co. (A. R. Gennaro edit. 1985). The choice<br>
of pharmaceutical excipient, diluent and/or carrier can be selected with regard to the<br>
intended route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. The<br>
pharmaceutical compositions may comprise as ~ or in addition to - the excipient, diluent<br>
25 and/or carrier any suitable binder(s), lubricant(s), suspending agent(s), coating agent(s),<br>
solubilising agent(s).<br>
Preservatives, stabilisers, dyes and even flavouring agents may be provided in the<br>
pharmaceutical composition. Examples of preservatives include sodium benzoate, sorbic<br>
30 acid and esters of p-hydroxybenzolc acid. Antioxidants and suspending agents may be<br>
also used.<br>
For some embodiments, the agents of the present invention may also be used in<br>
combination with a cyclodextrin. Cyclodextrins are known to form inclusion and non-<br>
35 inclusion complexes with drug molecules. Formation of a drug-cyclodextrin complex may<br>
modify the solubility, dissolution rate, bioavailability and/or stability property of a drug<br>
molecule. Drug-cyclodextrin complexes are generally useful for most dosage forms and<br>
administration routes. As an alternative to direct complexation with the drug the<br>
cyclodextrin may be used as an auxiliary additive, e. g. as a carrier, diluent or solubiliser.<br>
40 Alpha-, beta- and gamma-cyclodextrins are most commonly used and suitable examples<br>
are described in WO 91/11172, WO 94/02518 and WO 98/55148.<br><br><br>

The compounds of the invention may be milled using known milling procedures such as<br>
wet milling to obtain a particle size appropriate for tablet formation and for other<br>
formulation types. Finely divided (nanoparticulate) preparations of the compounds of the<br>
invention may be prepared by processes known in the art, for example see International<br>
5 Patent Application No. WO 02/00196 (SmithKline Beecham).<br>
The routes for administration (delivery) include, but are not limited to, one or more of:<br>
oral (e. g. as a tablet, capsule, or as an ingestable solution), topical, mucosal (e. g. as a<br>
nasal spray or aerosol for inhalation), nasal, parenteral (e. g. by an injectable form),<br>
10 gastrointestinal, intraspinal, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, intravenous, intrauterine,<br>
intraocular, intradermal, intracranial, intratracheal, intravaglnal, intracerebroventricular,<br>
intracerebral, subcutaneous, ophthalmic (including intravitreal or intracameral),<br>
transdermal, rectal, buccal, epidural and sublingual.<br>
15 There may be different composition/formulation requirements depending on the different<br>
delivery systems. By way of example, the pharmaceutical composition of the present<br>
invention may be formulated to be delivered using a mini-pump or by a mucosal route,<br>
for example, as a nasal spray or aerosol for inhalation or ingestable solution, or<br>
parenterally in which the composition is formulated by an injectable form, for delivery, by,<br>
20 for example, an intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous route. Alternatively, the<br>
formulation may be designed to be delivered by both routes.<br>
Where the agent is to be delivered mucosaJly through the gastrointestinal mucosa, it<br>
should be able to remain stable during transit though the gastrointestinal tract; for<br>
25 example, it should be resistant to proteolytic degradation, stable at acid pH and resistant<br>
to the detergent effects of bile.<br>
Where appropriate, the pharmaceutical compositions can be administered by inhalation,<br>
in the form of a suppository or pessary, topically in the form of a lotion, solution, cream,<br>
30 ointment or dusting powder, by use of a skin patch, orally in the form of tablets<br>
containing excipients such as starch or lactose, or in capsules or ovules either alone or<br>
in admixture with excipients, or in the form of elixirs, solutions or suspensions containing<br>
flavouring or colouring agents, Or they can be injected parenterally, for example<br>
intravenously, intramuscularly or subcutaneously. For parenteral administration, the<br>
35 compositions may be best used in the form of a sterile aqueous solution which may<br>
contain other substances, for example enough salts or monosaccharides to make the<br>
solution isotonic with blood. For buccal or sublingual administration the compositions<br>
may be administered in the form of tablets or lozenges which can be formulated in a<br>
conventional manner.<br>

For topical administration by inhalation the compounds according to the invention may be<br>
delivered for use in human or veterinary medicine via a nebuliser.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be used in combination with other therapeutic<br>
35 agents. The invention thus provides, in a further aspect, a combination comprising a<br>
compound of the invention or a pharmaceutlcally acceptable derivative thereof together<br>
with a further therapeutic agent.<br>
When a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutlcally acceptable derivative thereof<br>
40 is used in combination with a second therapeutic agent active against the same disease<br>
state the dose of each compound may differ from that when the compound is used<br>
alone. Appropriate doses will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art It will be<br><br><br>
WO 2004/101587<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/005083<br><br>
appreciated that the amount of a compound of the invention required for use In treatment<br>
will vary with the nature of the condition being treated and the age and the condition of<br>
the patient and will be ultimately at the discretion of the attendant physician or<br>
veterinarian. The compounds of the present invention may for example be used for<br>
5 topical administration with other active Ingredients such as corticosteroids or antifungals<br>
as appropriate.<br>
The combinations referred to above may conveniently be presented for use in the form<br>
of a pharmaceutical formulation and thus pharmaceutical formulations comprising a<br>
10 combination as defined above together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or<br>
excipient comprise a further aspect of the invention. The individual components of such<br>
combinations may be administered either sequentially or simultaneously in separate or<br>
combined pharmaceutical formulations by any convenient route.<br>
15 When administration is sequential, either the compound of the invention or the second<br>
therapeutic agent may be administered first. When administration is simultaneous, the<br>
combination may be administered either in the same or different pharmaceutical<br>
composition.<br>
20 When combined in the same formulation it will be appreciated that the two compounds<br>
must be stable and compatible with each other and the other components of the<br>
formulation. When formulated separately they may be provided in any convenient<br>
formulation, conveniently in such manner as are known for such compounds in the art.<br>
25 The compositions may contain from 0.01-99% of the active material. For topical<br>
administration, for example, the composition will generally contain from 0.01-10%, more<br>
preferably 0.01-1% of the active material.<br>
Typically, a physician will determine the actual dosage which will be most suitable for an<br>
30 individual subject. The specific dose level and frequency of dosage for any particular<br>
individual may be varied and will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of<br>
the specific compound employed, the metabolic stability and length of action of that<br>
compound, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, mode and time of<br>
administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the severity of the particular condition,<br>
35 and the Individual undergoing therapy.<br>
For oral and parenteral administration to humans, the daily dosage level of the agent may<br>
be in single or divided doses.<br>
40 For systemic administration the dally dose as employed for adult human treatment it will<br>
range from 2-100mg/kg body weight, preferably 5-60mg/kg body weight, which may be<br>
administered in 1 to 4 daily doses, for example, depending on the route of administration<br><br><br>
WO 2004/101587<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/005083<br><br>
and the condition of the patient When the composition comprises dosage units, each unit<br>
will preferably contain 200mg to 1g of active ingredient The duration of treatment will be<br>
dictated by the rate of response rather than by arbitrary numbers of days.<br>
