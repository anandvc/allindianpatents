				<td>The present invention is about antagonistic anti-hTNFSF13b human antibodies. TNF<br>
family ligands are known to be among the most pleiotropic cytokines. inducing a large<br>
number of cellular responses, including proliferation, cytotoxicity, anti- viral activity,<br>
immunoregulatory activities, and the transcriptional regulation of several genes. The TNF<br>
family of cytokines and receptors has undergone a large expansion in the last few years<br>
with the advent of massive EST sequencing. TNFSF13b is the official name adopted by<br>
the TNF Congress for BLyS, TALL-1, BAFF, THANK, neutrokine-a, and zTNF (for<br>
review see Locksley et al. Cell 2001 104: 487). HumanTNFSF13b (hTNFSF13b) is a 285-<br>
amino acid type II membrane-bound protein that possesses a N- terminal cleavage site<br>
that allows for the existence of both soluble and membrane bound proteins. Functionally,<br>
TNFSF13b appears to regulate B cell and some T cell immune responses.<br>
Studies of septic shock syndrome and other disorders arising from overproduction of<br>
inflammatory cytokines have shown that an afflicted host will often counter high cytokine<br>
levels by releasing soluble cytokine receptors or by synthesizing high-affinity anti-<br>
cytokine antibodies. Methods of treatment that mimic such natural responses are<br>
considered as viable therapeutic approaches for alleviating cytokine-mediated disease.<br>
Thus, there is a well-recognized need for human antibodies that bind cytokines. such as<br>
TNFSF13b, that are involved in the regulation of cellular immune processes with high<br>
affinity and that have the capacity to antagonize the activity of the targeted cytokine in<br>
vitro and in vivo. Although international patent application WO00/50597 non-<br>
descriptively discloses antibodies directed at TNFSF13b, that application does not<br>
specifically describe the structural or functional characteristics of such antibodies.<br>
The present invention provides anti-hTNFSF13b human antibodies, or antigen- binding<br>
portions thereof. The antibodies of the invention are characterized by high affinity<br>
binding to TNFSF13b polypeptides, slow dissociation kinetics, and the capacity to<br>
antagonize at least one in vitro and/or in vivo activity associated with TNFSF13b<br>
polypeptides. The present invention also provides anti-hTNFSF13b human antibodies<br>
comprising a polypeptide selected from the group consisting of a polypeptide as shown in<br>
SEQ ID NO: 2, a polypeptide as shown in SEQ ID NO: 4, a polypeptide as shown in SEQ<br>
ID NO: 6, a polypeptide as shown in SEQ ID NO: 8, a polypeptide as shown in SEQ ID<br>
NO: 10, a polypeptide as shown in SEQ ID NO: 12, a polypeptide as shown in SEQ ID<br>
NO: 14, and a polypeptide as shown in SEQ ID NO: 16.<br>
In another embodiment, the invention provides an isolated anti-hTNFSF13b<br>
human antibody which binds to a hTNFSF13b polypeptide and dissociates from the<br>
hTNFSF13b polypeptide with a Koff rate constant of 1 X 10-4 s-1 or less, as determined<br>
by surface plasmon resonance, or which inhibits TNFSF13b induced proliferation in an in<br>
vitro neutralization assay with an IC50 of 1 x 10-8 M or less.<br>
In an preferred embodiment, the invention provides an isolated anti-hTNFSF13b<br>
human antibody that has the following characteristics:<br>
a) inhibits TNFSF13b induced proliferation in an in vitro neutralization assay<br>
with an IC50 of 1 x 10-8 M or less;<br>
b) has a heavy chain CDR3 comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID<br>
NO: 16; and<br>
c) has a light chain CDR3 comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID<br>
NO:8.<br>
The invention also provides methods of treating or preventing acute or chronic<br>
diseases or conditions associated with B cell and some T cell activity including, but not<br>
limited to, autoimmune disorders, such as systemic lupus crythematosus, rheumatoid<br>
arthritis, and/or neoplasia comprising the administration of an anti-hTNFSF13b human<br>
antibody of the present invention.<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention provides sequences that encode the<br>
novel anti-hTNFSF13b human antibodies, vectors composing the polynucleotide<br>
sequences encoding anti-hTNFSF13b human antibodies, host cells transformed with<br>
vectors incorporating polynucleotides that encode the anti-hTNFSF13b human antibodies,<br>
formulations comprising anti-hTNFSF13b human antibodies and methods of making and<br>
using the same.<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention provides the epitope of the antigen<br>
to which the novel anti-hTNFSF13b human antibodies bind. Thus, the invention also<br>
provides a use of an antibody that binds the epitope of the present invention thereby<br>
neutralizing the TNFSF13b activity for the treatment or prevention of acute or chronic<br>
diseases or conditions associated with B cell and some T cell activity including, but not<br>
limited to, autoimmune disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid<br>
arthritis, and/or neoplasia.<br>
The invention also encompasses an article of manufacture comprising a packaging<br>
material and an antibody contained within said packaging material, wherein the antibody<br>
neutralizes TNFSF13b activity for treatment or prevention of a human subject suffering<br>
from a disorder in which TNFSF13b activity is detrimental, and wherein the packaging<br>
material comprises a package insert which indicates that the antibody neutralizes by<br>
binding an epitope of TNFSF13b, wherein the epitope comprises lysine at position 71,<br>
threonine at position 72, tyrosine at position 73, and glutamic acid at position 105; and a<br>
package insert that provides for administration of the dosage form that results in<br>
neutralizing TNFSF13b activity.<br>

In order that the present invention may be more readily understood, certain terms<br>
are first defined.<br>
An antibody is an immunoglobulin molecule comprised of four polypeptide<br>
chains, two heavy (H) chains (about 50-70 kDa) and two light (L) chains (about 25 kDa)<br>
inter-connected by disulfide bonds. Light chains are classified as kappa and lambda.<br>
Heavy chains are classified as gamma, mu, alpha, delta, or epsilon, and define the<br>
antibody's isotype as IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, and IgE, respectively. Each heavy chain is<br>
comprised of a heavy chain variable region (abbreviated herein as HCVR) and a heavy<br>
chain constant region. The heavy chain constant region is comprised of three domains,<br>
CH1, CH2, and CH3 for IgG, IgD and IgA, and 4 domains, CH1, CH2, CH3, CH4 for<br>
IgM and IgE. Each light chain is comprised of a light chain variable region (abbreviated<br>
herein as LCVR) and a light chain constant region. The light chain constant region is<br>
comprised of one domain, CL. The HCVR and LCVR regions can be further subdivided<br>
into regions of hypervariability, termed complementarity determining regions (CDRs),<br>
interspersed with regions that are more conserved, termed framework regions (FR). Each<br>
HCVR and LCVR is composed of three CDRs and four FRs, arranged from amino-<br>
terminus to carboxy-terminus in the following order: FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3,<br>
CDR3, FR4. The assignment of amino acids to each domain is in accordance with well<br>
known conventions. [Rabat, et al, Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth<br>
Edition, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, NIH Publication No. 91-3242<br>
(1991); Chothia, et al., J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917 (1987); Chothia, et al., Nature 342:878-<br>
883 (1989)]. The functional characteristics of the antibody to bind a particular antigen are<br>
determined by the CDRs.<br>
In the present disclosure the term "antibody" is intended to refer to a monoclonal<br>
antibody per se. A monoclonal antibody can be a human antibody, chimeric antibody,<br>
humanized antibody, Fab fragment, Fab' fragment, F(ab')2, or single chain FV fragment.<br>
Preferably the term "antibody" refers to human antibody.<br>
The term "human antibody" includes antibodies having variable and constant<br>
regions corresponding to human germline immunoglobulin sequences. Human antibodies<br>
have several advantages over non-human and chimeric antibodies for use in human<br>
therapy. For example, the effector portion of a human antibody may interact better with<br>
the other parts of the human immune system (e.g., destroy the target cells more efficiently<br>
by complement-dependent cytotoxiciry (CDC) or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity<br>
(ADCC)). Another advantage is that the human immune system should not recognize the<br>
human antibody as foreign, and, therefore the antibody response against such an injected<br>
antibody should be less than against a totally foreign non-human antibody or a partially<br>
foreign chimeric antibody. In addition, injected non-human antibodies have been reported<br>
to have a half-life in the human circulation much shorter than the half-life of human<br>
antibodies. Injected human antibodies will have a half-life essentially identical to<br>
naturally occurring human antibodies, allowing smaller and less frequent doses to be<br>
given.<br>
The term "hTNFSF13b" refers to the human form of a member of the tumor<br>
necrosis factor family of ligands described in international patent applications<br>
WO98/18921 and WOOO/50597 (referred to therein as neutrokine-a). The term<br>
"TNFSF13b" is intended to encompass hTNFSF13b as well as homologs of hTNFSF13b<br>
derived from other species. The terms "hTNFSF13b" and "TNFSF13b" are intended to<br>
include forms thereof, which can be prepared by standard recombinant expression<br>
methods or purchased commercially (Research Diagnostics Inc. Catalog No. RDI-3113,<br>
rhuBAFF, Flanders, N.J.) as well as generated synthetically.<br>
The phrase "biological property", "biological characteristic", and the term<br>
"activity" in reference to an antibody of the present invention are used interchangeably<br>
herein and include, but are not limited to, epitope affinity and specificity (e.g., anti-<br>
hTNFSF13b human antibody binding to hTNFSFl 3b), ability to antagonize the activity of<br>
the targeted polypeptide (e.g., TNFSF13b activity), the in vivo stability of the antibody,<br>
and the immunogenic properties of the antibody. Other identifiable biological properties<br>
or characteristics of an antibody recognized in the art include for example, cross-<br>
reactivity, (i.e., with non-human homologs of the targeted polypeptide, or with other<br>
proteins or tissues, generally), and ability to preserve high expression levels of protein in<br>
mammalian cells. The aforementioned properties or characteristics can be observed or<br>
measured using art-recognized techniques including, but not limited to ELISA,<br>
competitive ELISA, surface plasmon resonance analysis, in vitro and in vivo<br>
neutralization assays (e.g., Example 2), and immunohistochemistry with tissue sections<br>
from different sources including human, primate, or any other source as the need may be.<br>
Particular activities and biological properties of anti-hTNFSF13b human antibodies are<br>
described in further detail in the Examples below.<br>
The phrase "contact position" includes an amino acid position in the CDR1,<br>
CDR2 or CDR3 of the heavy chain variable region or the light chain variable region of an<br>
antibody which is occupied by an amino acid that contacts antigen. If a CDR amino acid<br>
contacts the antigen, then that amino acid can be considered to occupy a contact position.<br>
"Conservative substitution" or "conservative amino acid substitution" refers to<br>
amino acid substitutions, either from natural mutations or human manipulation, wherein<br>
the antibodies produced by such substitutions have substantially the same (or improved or<br>
reduced, as may be desirable) activity(ies) as the antibodies disclosed herein.<br>
The term "epitope" as used herein refers to a region of a protein molecule to which<br>
an antibody can bind. An "immunogenic epitope" is defined as the part of a protein that<br>
elicits an antibody response when the whole protein is the immunogen.<br>
The term "binds" as used herein, generally refers to the interaction of the antibody<br>
to the epitope of the antigen. More specifically, the term "binds" relates to the affinity of<br>
the antibody to the epitope of the antigen. Affinity is measured by Kd.<br>
The term "inhibit" or "inhibiting" includes the generally accepted meaning, which<br>
includes neutralizing, prohibiting, preventing, restraining, slowing, stopping, or reversing<br>
progression or severity of a disease or condition.<br>
The term "neutralizing" or "antagonizing" in reference to an anti-TNFSF13b<br>
antibody or the phrase "antibody that antagonizes TNFSF13b activity" is intended to refer<br>
to an antibody or antibody fragment whose binding to TNFSF13b results in inhibition of a<br>
biological activity induced by TNFSF13b polypeptides. Inhibition of TNFSF13b<br>
biological activity can be assessed by measuring one or more in vitro or in vivo indicators<br>
of TNFSF13b biological activity including, but not limited to, TNFSF13b-induced<br>
proliferation, TNFSF13b-induced immunoglobulin secretion, TNFSF13b-induced<br>
prevention of B cell apoptosis, or inhibition of receptor binding in a TNFSF13b receptor<br>
binding assay. Indicators of TNFSF13b biological activity can be assessed by one or<br>
more of the several in vitro or in vivo assays known in the art. (see, for example, Moore,<br>
P.A., et al., Science, 285:260-263 (1999); Schneider, P., et al.,J. Exp. Med., 189:1747-<br>
1756 (1999); Shu, H., et al., J. Leuko. Biol., 65:680-683 (1999); Mukhopadhyay, A., et<br>
al., J. Biol. Chem., 274:15978-15981 (1999); Mackay, F. et al.. J. Exp. Med., 190:1697-<br>
1710 (1999); Gross, J.A., et al.. Nature, 404:995-999 (2000); and Example 2).<br>
Preferably, the ability of an antibody to neutralize or antagonize TNFSF13b activity is<br>
assessed by inhibition of B cell proliferation as shown in Example 2.<br>
The term "Koff", as used herein, is intended to refer to the off rate constant for<br>
dissociation of an antibody from the antibody/antigen complex.<br>
The term "Kd", as used herein, is intended to refer to the dissociation constant or<br>
the "off" rate divided by the "on" rate, of a particular antibody-antigen interaction. For<br>
purposes of the present invention KD was determined as shown in Example 4<br>
An "isolated" antibody is one that has been identified and separated and/or<br>
recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its<br>
natural environment are materials that would interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses<br>
for the antibody, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or non-<br>
proteinaceous solutes. Ordinarily, an isolated antibody is prepared by at least one<br>
purification step. In preferred embodiments, the antibody will be purified (1) to greater<br>
than 95% by weight of antibody as determined by the Lowry method, and most preferably<br>
more than 99% by weight, and (2) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under reducing or<br>
nonreducing conditions using Coomassie blue, or preferably, silver stain. Preferably, an<br>
"isolated antibody" is an antibody that is substantially free of other antibodies having<br>
different antigenic specificities (e.g., an isolated antibody that specifically binds<br>
hTNFSF13b substantially free of antibodies that specifically bind antigens other than<br>
hTNFSF13b polypeptide).<br>
The phrase "nucleic acid molecule" includes DNA molecules and RNA molecules.<br>
A nucleic acid molecule may be single-stranded or double-stranded, but preferably is<br>
double-stranded DNA.<br>
The phrase "isolated nucleic acid molecule", as used herein in reference to nucleic<br>
acids encoding antibodies or antibody fragments (e.g., HCVR, LCVR, CDR3) that bind<br>
hTNFSF13b polypeptide, includes a nucleic acid molecule in which the nuclcotide<br>
sequences encoding the antibody, or antibody portion, are free of other nucleotide<br>
sequences encoding antibodies or antibody fragments that bind antigens other than<br>
hTNFSF13b polypeptide, which other sequences may naturally flank the nucleic acid in<br>
human genomic DNA. Thus, for example, an isolated nucleic acid of the invention<br>
encoding a HCVR region of an anti-hTNFSF13b human antibody contains no other<br>
sequences encoding HCVR regions that bind antigens other than hTNFSF13b<br>
polypeptide.<br>
The term "vector" includes a nucleic acid molecule capable of transporting<br>
another nucleic acid to which it has been linked. One type of vector is a "plasmid", which<br>
refers to a circular double stranded DNA loop into which additional DNA segments may<br>
be ligated. Another type of vector is a viral vector, wherein additional DNA segments<br>
may be ligated into the viral genome. Certain vectors are capable of autonomous<br>
replication in a host cell into which they are introduced (e.g., bacterial vectors having a<br>
bacterial origin of replication and episomal mammalian vectors). Other vectors (e.g.,<br>
non-episomal mammalian vectors) can be integrated into the genome of a host cell upon<br>
introduction into the host cell, and thereby are replicated along with the host genome.<br>
Moreover, certain vectors are capable of directing the expression of genes to which they<br>
are operatively linked. Such vectors are referred to herein as "recombinant expression<br>
vectors" (or simply, "expression vectors"). In general, expression vectors of utility in<br>
recombinant DNA techniques are often in the form of plasmids. In the present<br>
specification, "plasmid" and "vector" may be used interchangeably as the plasmid is the<br>
most commonly used form of vector. However, the invention is intended to include such<br>
other forms of expression vectors, such as vital vectors (e.g., replication defective<br>
retroviruscs, adenoviruses, and adeno-associated viruses), that serve equivalent functions.<br>
Nucleic acid is "operably linked" when it is placed into a functional relationship<br>
with another nucleic acid sequence. For example, DNA for a presequence or secretory<br>
leader is operably Iinked to DNA for a polypeptide if it is expressed as a preprotein that<br>
participates in the secretion of the polypeptide; a promoter or enhancer is operably linked<br>
to a coding sequence if it affects the transcription of the sequence; or a ribosome binding<br>
site is operably linked to a coding sequence if it is positioned so as to facilitate translation.<br>
Generally, "Operably indeed" means that the DNA sequences being linked are contiguous,<br>
and, in the case of a secretory leader, contiguous and in reading frame. However,<br>
enhancers do not have to be contiguous. Linking is accomplished by ligation at<br>
convenient restriction sites. If such sites do not exist, the synthetic oligonucleotide<br>
adaptors or linkers are used in accordance with conventional practice.<br>
The term "recombinant" in reference to an antibody includes antibodies that are<br>
prepared, expressed, created or isolated by recombinant means. Representative examples<br>
include antibodies expressed using a recombinant expression vector transfected into a<br>
host cell, antibodies isolated from a recombinant, combinatorial human antibody library,<br>
antibodies isolated from an animal (e.g., a mouse) that is transgenic for human<br>
immunoglobulin genes antibodies prepared, expressed, created or isolated by any<br>
means that involves splicing of human immunoglobulin gene sequences to other DNA<br>
sequences. Such recombinant human antibodies have variable and constant regions<br>
derived from human germline immunosequences.<br>
The phrase "recombinant host cell" (or simply "host cell") includes a cell into<br>
which a recombinant expression vector has been introduced. It should be understood that<br>
such terms are intended to refer not only to the particular subject cell but to the progeny of<br>
such a cell. Because certain modifications may occur in succeeding generations due to<br>
either mutation or environmental influences, such progeny may not, in fact, be identical to<br>
the parent cell, but are stall included within the scope of the term "host cell" as used<br>
herein.<br>
Recombinant human antibodies may also be subjected to in vitro mutagenesis (or,<br>
when as animal transgenic for human Ig sequence is used, in vivo somatic mutagenesis)<br>
and, thus, the amino acid sequences of the HCVR and LCVR regions of the recombinant<br>
antibodies are sequences that, while derived from those related to human germline HCVR<br>
and LCVR sequences, may not naturally exist within the human antibody germline<br>
repertoire in vivo.<br>
Transgenic animals (e.g., mice) that are capable, upon immunization, of producing<br>
a full repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin<br>
production can be employed. Transfer of the human germ-line immunoglobulin gene<br>
array in such germ-line mutant mice will result in the production of human antibodies<br>
upon antigen challenge (see, e.g., Jakobovits, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90:2551-<br>
2555, (1993); Jakobovits, et al., Nature, 362:255-258, (1993; Bruggemann, et al.. Year in<br>
Immun., 7:33 (1993); Nature 148:1547-1553 (1994), Nature Biotechnology 14:826<br>
(1996); Gross, J.A., et al.. Nature, 404:995-999 (2000); and U.S. patents nos. 5,877,397,<br>

and 5,545,806 (each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all<br>
purposes)). Human antibodies can also be produced in phage display libraries<br>
(Hoogenboom and Winter, J. Mol. Biol., 227:381 (1992); Marks, et al., J. Mol. Biol.,<br>
222:581 (1991)). The techniques of Cole et al. and Boerner, et al. are also available for<br>
the preparation of human monoclonal antibodies (Cole, et al.. Monoclonal Antibodies and<br>
Cancer Therap, Alan R. Liss, p. 77 (1985) and Boerner, et al., J. Immunol., 147(l):86-95<br>
(1991)).<br>

Various aspects of the invention are described in further detail in the following<br>
subsections.<br>
The present invention relates to human monoclonal antibodies that are specific for<br>
and neutralize bioactive hTNFSF13b polypeptides. Also disclosed are antibody heavy<br>
and light chain amino acid sequences which are highly specific for and neutralize<br>
TNFSF13b polypeptides when they are bound to them. This high specificity enables the<br>
anti-hTNFSF13b human antibodies, and human monoclonal antibodies with like<br>
specificity, to be immunotherapy of TNFSF13b associated diseases.<br>
In one aspect, the invention provides an isolated human antibody comprising at<br>
least one of the amino acid sequences shown in SEQ ID NOS: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, or 16<br>
and that binds a TNFSF13b polypeptide epitope with high affinity, dissociates from a<br>

and CDR3 polypeptide of the HCVR as shown in SEQ ID NO: 16.<br>
More preferred, the anti-hTNFSF13b human antibody comprises a light chain<br>
variable region (LCVR) polypeptide as shown in SEQ ID NO: 2 or a heavy chain variable<br>
region (HCVR) polypeptide as shown in SEQ ID NO: 10. Even more preferred, the anti-<br>
hTNFSF13b human antibody comprises the LCVR polypeptide as shown in SEQ ID NO:<br>
2 and the HCVR polypeptide as shown in SEQ ID NO: 10.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the isolated human antibody dissociates from a bound<br>
TNFSF13b polypeptide with a Koff rate constant of 5 x 10-5 s-1 or less, and inhibits<br>
TNFSF13b induced proliferation in an in vitro neutralization assay with an IC50 of 1 x<br>
10-7 M or less. In more preferred embodiments, the isolated human antibody dissociates<br>
from a bound TNFSF13b polypeptide epitope with a Koff rate constant of 1 x 10-5 s-1 or<br>
less and inhibits TNFSF13b induced proliferation in an in vitro neutralization assay with<br>
an IC50 of 1 x 10-8 M or less. In an even more preferred embodiment, the isolated anti-<br>
TNFSF13b human antibody dissociates from a bound hTNFSF13b polypeptide with a<br>
Koff rate constant of 5 x 10-6 s-1 or less and inhibits TNFSF13b induced proliferation in<br>
an in vitro assay with an IC50 of 1 x 10-9 M or less. Examples of anti-hTNFSF13b<br>
human antibodies that meet, the aforementioned kinetic and neutralization criteria include<br>
4A5-3.1.1-B4 antibodies.<br>
The most preferred anti-hTNFSF 13b human antibody of the present invention is<br>
referred to herein as 4A5-3.1.1-B4. 4A5-3.1.1-B4 has LCVR and HCVR polypeptide<br>
sequences as shown in SEQ ID NO:2 and SEQ ID NO: 10, respectively. The poly-<br>
nucleotide sequence encoding the LCVR and HCVR of 4A5-3.1.1-B4 is shown in SEQ<br>
ID NO: I and SEQ ID NO:9, respectively. The properties of the anti-hTNFSF 13b human<br>
antibodies of the present invention are specifically disclosed in the Examples.<br>
Particularly notable is the high affinity for TNFSF13b polypeptide, slow dissociation<br>
kinetics, and high capacity to antagonize TNFSF13b polypeptide activity demonstrated by<br>
4A5-3.1.1-B4.<br>
The Koff of an anti-hTNFSF 13b human antibody can be determined by surface<br>
plasmon resonance as generally described in Example 4. Generally, surface plasmon<br>
resonance analysis measures real-time binding interactions between ligand (recombinant<br>
TNFSF13b polypeptide immobilized on a biosensor matrix) and analyte (antibodies in<br>
solution) by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) using the BIAcore system (Pharmacia<br>
Biosensor, Piscataway, NJ). SPR analysis can also be performed by immobilizing the<br>
analyte (antibodies on a biosensor matrix) and presenting the ligand (recombinant<br>
TNFSF13b in solution).<br>
In one aspect, the present invention is also directed to the cell lines which produce<br>
the anti-hTNFSF13b human antibodies of the present invention. The isolation of cell<br>
lines producing monoclonal antibodies of the invention can be accomplished using<br>
routine screening techniques known in the art. A hybridoma which produces an anti-<br>
hTNFSF13b human antibody of the present invention has been deposited with ATCC,<br>
(ATCC PTA-3674) as disclosed herein.<br>
A wide variety of host expression systems can be used to express the antibodies of<br>
the present invention including bacterial, yeast, baculoviral, plant, and mammalian<br>
expression systems (as well as phage display expression systems). An example of a<br>
suitable bacterial expression vector is pUC119 (Sfi). Other antibody expression systems<br>
are also known in the art and are contemplated herein.<br>
An antibody of the invention can be prepared by recombinant expression of<br>
immunoglobulin light and heavy chain genes in a host cell. To express an antibody<br>
recombinantly, a host cell is transfected with one or more recombinant expression vectors<br>
carrying DNA fragments encoding the immunoglobulin light and heavy chains of the<br>
antibody such that the light and heavy chains are expressed in the host cell. Preferably,<br>
the recombinant antibodies are secreted into the medium in which the host cells are<br>
cultured, from which medium the antibodies can be recovered. Standard recombinant<br>
DNA methodologies are used to obtain antibody heavy and light chain genes, incorporate<br>
these genes into recombinant expression vectors, and introduce the vectors into host cells.<br>
The isolated DNA encoding the HCVR region can be converted to a full-length<br>
heavy chain gene by operatively linking the HCVR-encoding DNA to another DNA<br>
molecule encoding heavy chain constant regions (CH1, CH2, and CH3). The DNA<br>
sequences of human heavy chain constant region genes are known in the art and DNA<br>
fragments encompassing these regions can be obtained by standard PCR amplification.<br>
The heavy chain constant region can be an IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, lgG4, IgA, lgE, IgM or IgD<br>
constant region and any allotypic variant therein as described in Kabat, (Kabat, el al.<br>
Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, U.S. Department of<br>
Health and Human Services, N1H Publication No. 91-3242 (1991)), but most preferably is<br>
an IgG1, or IgG4 constant region. Alternatively, the antibody portion can be an Fab<br>
fragment, a Fab' fragment, F(ab')2, or a single chain FV fragment. For a Fab fragment<br>
heavy chain gene, the HCVR-encoding DNA can be operatively linked to another DNA<br>
molecule encoding only the heavy chain CH1 constant region.<br>
The isolated DNA encoding the LCVR region can be converted to a full-length<br>
light chain gene (as well as a Fab light chain gene) by operatively linking the LCVR-<br>
encoding DNA to another DNA molecule encoding the light chain constant region, CL.<br>
The DNA sequences of human light chain constant region genes are known in the art and<br>
DNA fragments encompassing these regions can be obtained by standard PCR<br>
amplification. The light chain constant region can be a kappa or lambda constant region.<br>
To create a scFV gene, the HCVR- and LCVR-encoding DNA fragments are<br>
operatively linked to another fragment encoding a flexible linker, e.g., encoding the amino<br>
acid sequence Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser- Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser (Gly4-<br>
Ser)3, such that the HCVR and LCVR sequences can be expressed as a contiguous single-<br>
chain protein, with the LCVR and HCVR regions joined by the flexible linker (see e.g.,<br>
Bird et al. Science 242:423-426 (1988); Huston, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. USA<br>
85:5879-5883 (1988); McCafferty, et al., Nature 348:552-554 (1990)).<br>
To express the antibodies of the invention, DNAs encoding partial or full-length<br>
light and heavy chains, obtained as described above, are inserted into expression vectors<br>
such that the genes are operatively linked to transcriptional and translational control<br>
sequences. The antibody gene is ligated into a vector such that transcriptional and<br>
translational control sequences within the vector serve their intended function of<br>
regulating the transcription and translation of the antibody gene. The expression vector<br>
and expression control sequences are chosen to be compatible with the expression host<br>
cell used. The antibody light chain gene and the antibody heavy chain gene can be<br>
inserted into separate vector or, more typically, both genes are inserted into the same<br>
expression vector. The antibody genes are inserted into the expression vector by standard<br>
methods (e.g., ligation of complementary restriction sites on the antibody gene fragment<br>
and vector, or blunt end ligation if no restriction sites are present). Additionally, or<br>
alternatively, the recombinant expression vector can encode a signal peptide that<br>
facilitates secretion of the anti-hTNFSF13b human antibody chain from a host cell. The<br>
anti-hTNFSF13b human antibody chain gene can be cloned into the vector such that the<br>
signal peptide is linked in-frame to the amino terminus of the antibody chain gene. The<br>
signal peptide can be an immunoglobulin signal peptide or a heterologous signal peptide<br>
(i.e., a signal peptide from a non-immunoglobulin protein).<br>
In addition to the antibody chain genes, the recombinant expression vectors of the<br>
invention carry regulatory sequences that control the expression of the antibody chain<br>
genes in a host cell. Regulatory sequences comprise promoters, enhancers and other<br>
expression control elements (e.g., polyadenylation signals) that control the transcription or<br>
translation of the antibody chain genes. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art<br>
that the design of the expression vector, including the selection of regulatory sequences<br>
may depend on such factors as the choice of the host cell to be transformed, the level of<br>
expression of protein desired, etc. Preferred regulatory sequences for mammalian host<br>
cell expression include viral elements that direct high levels of protein expression in<br>
mammalian cells, such as promoters and/or enhancers derived from cytomegalovirus<br>
(CMV) (such as the CMV promoter/enhancer), Simian Virus 40 (SV40) (such as the<br>
SV40 promoter/enhancer), adenovirus, (e.g., the adenovirus major late promoter<br>
(AdMLP)) and polyoma.<br>
In addition to the antibody chain genes and regulatory sequences, the recombinant<br>
expression vectors of the invention may carry additional sequences, such as sequences<br>
that regulate replication of the vector in host cells (e.g., origins of replication) and<br>
selectable marker genes. The selectable marker gene facilitates selection of host cells into<br>
which the vector has been introduced. For example, typically the selectable marker gene<br>
confers resistance to drugs, such as G418, hygromycin, or methotrexatc, on a host cell<br>
into which the vector has been introduced. Preferred selectable marker genes include the<br>
dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene (for use in dhfr-host cells with methotrexate<br>
selection/amplification) and the neo gene (for G4I8 selection).<br>
For expression of the light and heavy chains, the expression vectors) encoding the<br>
heavy and light chains is transfected into a host cell by standard techniques. The various<br>
forms of the term "transfection" are intended to encompass a wide variety of techniques<br>
commonly used for the introduction of exogenous DNA into a prokaryotic or eukaryotic<br>
host cell, e.g., electroporation, calcium-phosphate precipitation, DEAE-dextran<br>
transfection and the like. Although it is theoretically possible to express the antibodies of<br>
the invention in either prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cells, expression of antibodies in<br>
eukaryotic cells, and most preferably mammalian host cells, is the most preferred because<br>
such eukaryotic cells, and in particular mammalian cells, are more likely than prokaryotic<br>
cells to assemble and secrete a properly folded and immunologically active antibody.<br>
Preferred mammalian host cells for expressing the recombinant antibodies of the<br>
invention include Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO cells) (including dhfr-CHO cells,<br>
described in Urlaub and Chasin, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 77:4216-4220 (1980), used<br>
with a DHFR selectable marker, e.g., as described in R.J. Kaufman and P.A. Sharp, Mol.<br>
Biol., 159:601-621 (1982)), NSO myeloma cells, COS cells and SP2 cells. When<br>
recombinant expression vectors encoding antibody genes are introduced into mammalian<br>
host cells, the antibodies are produced by culturing the host cells for a period of time<br>
sufficient to allow for expression of the antibody in the host cells or, more preferably,<br>
secretion of the antibody into the culture medium in which the host cells are grown.<br>
Antibodies can be recovered from the culture medium using standard protein purification<br>
methods.<br>
Host cells can also be used to produce portions of intact antibodies, such as Fab<br>
fragments of scFV molecules. It will be understood that variations on the above<br>
procedure are within the scope of the present invention. For example, it may be desirable<br>
to transfect a host cell with DNA encoding either the light chain or the heavy chain (but<br>
not both) of an antibody of this invention. Recombinant DNA technology may also be<br>
used to remove some or all of the DNA encoding either or both of the light and heavy<br>
chains that is not necessary for binding to hTNFSF13b. The molecules expressed from<br>
such truncated DNA molecules are also encompassed by the antibodies of the invention.<br>
In a one system for recombinant expression of an antibody of the invention, a recombinant<br>
expression vector encoding both the antibody heavy chain and the antibody light chain is<br>
introduced into dhfr-CHO cells by calcium phosphate-mediated transfection. Within the<br>
recombinant expression vector, the antibody heavy and light chain genes are each<br>
operatively linked to enhancer/promoter regulatory elements (e.g., derived from SV40,<br>
CMV, adenovirus and the like, such as a CMV enhancer/AdMLP promoter regulatory<br>
element or an SV40 enhancer/AdMLP promoter regulatory element) to drive high levels<br>
of transcription of the genes. The recombinant expression vector also carries a DHFR<br>
gene, which allows for selection of CHO cells that have been transfected with the vector<br>
using methotrexate selection/amplification. The selected transformant host cells are<br>
culture to allow for expression of the antibody heavy and light chains and intact antibody<br>
is recovered from the culture medium. Standard molecular biology techniques are used to<br>
prepare the recombinant expression vector, transfect the host cells, select for<br>
transformants, culture the host cells and recover the antibody from the culture medium.<br>
Antibodies or antigen-binding portions thereof of the invention can be expressed in an<br>
animal (e.g., a mouse) that is transgenic for human immunoglobulin genes (see e.g.,<br>
Taylor, L.D., et al. Nucl. Acids Res., 20:6287-6295(1992)). Plant cells can also be<br>
modified to create transgenic plants that express the antibody or antigen binding portion<br>
thereof, of the invention.<br>
In view of the foregoing, another aspect of the invention pertains to nucleic acids,<br>
vectors, and host cell compositions that can be used for recombinant expression of the<br>
antibodies and antibody portions of the invention. Preferably, the invention features<br>
isolated nucleic acids that encode CDRs of 4A5-3.1.1-B4, or the full heavy and/or light<br>
chain variable region of 4A5-3.1.1-B4. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the invention<br>
features an isolated nucleic acid encoding an antibody heavy chain variable region that<br>
encodes the 4A5-3.1.1-B4 heavy chain CDR3 comprising the amino acid sequence of<br>
SEQ ID NO: 16. Preferably, the nucleic acid encoding the antibody heavy chain variable<br>
region further encodes a 4A5-3.1.1-B4 heavy chain CDR2 which comprises the amino<br>
acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 14. More preferably, the nucleic acid encoding the antibody<br>
heavy chain variable region further encodes a 4A5-3.1.1-B4 heavy chain CDR1 which<br>
comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 12. Even more preferably, the isolated<br>
nucleic acid encodes an antibody heavy chain variable region comprising the amino acid<br>
sequence of SEQ ID NO: 10 (the full HCVR region of 4A5-3.1.1-B4).<br>
In other embodiments, the invention features an isolated nucleic acid encoding an<br>
antibody light chain variable region that encodes the 4A5-3.1.1-B4 light chain CDR3<br>
comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:8 Preferably, the nucleic acid<br>
encoding the antibody light chain variable region further encodes a 4A5-3.1.1-B4 light<br>
chain CDR1 which comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:4. Even more<br>
preferably, the isolated nucleic acid encodes an antibody light chain variable region<br>
comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 (the full LCVR region of 4A5-<br>
3.1.1-B4).<br>
In other embodiments, the invention features an isolated nucleic acid encoding an<br>
antibody light chain variable region that encodes the 4A5-3.1.1-B4 light chain CDR3<br>
comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:8 Preferably, the nucleic acid<br>
encoding the antibody light chain variable region further encodes a 4A5-3.1.1-B4 light<br>
chain CDR1 which comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:4. Even more<br>
preferably, the isolated nucleic acid encodes an antibody light chain variable region<br>
comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 (the full LCVR region of 4A5-<br>
3.1.1-B4).<br>
In another embodiment, the invention provides an isolated nucleic acid encoding a<br>
heavy chain CDR3 domain comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 16 (i.e.,<br>
the 4A5-3.1.1-B4 HCVR CDR3). This nucleic acid can encode only the CDR3 region or,<br>
more preferably, encodes an entire antibody heavy chain variable region (HCVR). For<br>
example, the nucleic acid can encode a HCVR having a CDR2 domain comprising the<br>
amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 14 (i.e., the 4A5-3.1.1-B4 HCVR CDR2) and a<br>
CDR1 domain comprising the amino acid sequence of SED ID NO: 12 (i.e., 4A5-3.1.1-B4<br>
HCVR CDR1).<br>
In still another embodiment, the invention provides an isolated nucleic acid<br>
encoding an antibody light chain variable region comprising the amino acid sequence of<br>
SEQ ID NO:2 (i.e., the 4A5-3.1.1-B4 LCVR). Preferably this nucleic acid comprises the<br>
nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, although the skilled artisan will appreciate that due<br>
to the degeneracy of the genetic code, other nucleotide sequences can encode the amino<br>
acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2. The nucleic acid can encode only the LCVR or can also<br>
encode an antibody light chain constant region, operatively linked to the LCVR. In one<br>
embodiment, this nucleic acid is in a recombinant expression vector.<br>
In still another embodiment, the invention provides an isolated nucleic acid<br>
encoding an antibody heavy chain variable region comprising the amino acid sequence of<br>
SEQ ID NO:10 (i.e., the 4A5-3.1.1-B4 HCVR). Preferably this nucleic acid comprises<br>
the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:9, although the skilled artisan will appreciate that<br>
due to the degeneracy of the genetic code, other nucleotide sequences can encode the<br>
amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:10. The nucleic acid can encode only the HCVR or<br>
can also encode a heavy chain constant region, operatively linked to the HCVR. For<br>
example, the nucleic acid can comprise an IgG1 or IgG4 constant region. In one<br>
embodiment, this nucleic acid is in a recombinant expression vector.<br>
Those of ordinary skill in the art are aware that modifications in the amino acid<br>
sequence of the antibody can result in an antibody that display equivalent or superior<br>
functional characteristics when compared to the original antibody. Alterations in the<br>
antibodies of the present invention can include one or more amino acid insertions,<br>
deletions, substitutions, truncations, fusions, and the like, either from natural mutations or<br>
human manipulation. The present invention encompasses antibodies disclosed herein<br>
further comprising one or more amino acid substitutions provided that the substituted<br>
antibodies have substantially the same (or improved or reduced, as may be desirable)<br>
activity(ies) as the antibodies disclosed herein. Preferably, a CDR of the present invention<br>
has 3 or less conservative substitutions. Preferably, a CDR of the present invention has 2<br>
or less conservative substitutions. Preferably, a CDR of the present invention has one<br>
conservative substitution. The skilled artisan will recognize that antibodies having<br>
conservative amino acid substitutions can be prepared by a variety of techniques known in<br>
the art. For example, a number of mutagenesis methods can be used, including PCR<br>
assembly, Kunkel (dut-ung-) and thiophosphate (Amersham Sculptor kit) oligonucleotide-<br>
directed mutagenesis. Conservative substitutions of interest are shown in Table 1 along<br>
with preferred substitutions.<br>
Table 1. Conservative Substitutions<br>
The invention also provides recombinant expression vectors encoding an antibody<br>
comprising a polypeptide selected from the group consisting of a polypeptide as shown in<br>
SEQ ID NO: 2, a polypeptide as shown in SEQ ID NO: 4, a polypeptide as shown in SEQ<br>
ID NO: 6, a polypeptide as shown in SEQ ID NO: 8, a polypeptide as shown in SEQ ID<br>
NO: 10, a polypeptide as shown in SEQ ID NO: 12, a polypeptide as shown in SEQ ID<br>
NO: 14; and a polypeptide as shown in SEQ ID NO: 16.<br>
The invention also provides recombinant expression vectors encoding both an<br>
antibody heavy chain and an antibody light chain. For example, in one embodiment, the<br>
invention provides a recombinant expression vector encoding:<br>
a) an antibody heavy chain having a variable region comprising the amino acid<br>
sequence of SEQ ID NO: 10; and<br>
b) an antibody light chain having a variable region comprising the amino acid<br>
sequence of SEQ ID NO:2.<br>
Once expressed, the whole antibodies, their dimers, individual light and heavy<br>
chains, or other immunoglobulin forms of the present invention can be purified accoiding<br>
to standard procedures of the art, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, ion<br>
exchange, affinity, reverse phase, hydrophobic interaction column chromatography, gel<br>
electro-phoresis and the like. Substantially pure immunoglobulins of at least about 90 to<br>
95% homogeneity are preferred, and 98 to 99% or more homogeneity most preferred, for<br>
pharmaceutical uses. Once purified, partially or to homogeneity as desired, the<br>
polypeptides may then be used therapeutically or prophylactically, as directed herein.<br>
The antibodies of the present invention can be incorporated into pharmaceutical<br>
compositions suitable for administration to a subject. Typically, the pharmaceutical<br>
composition comprises an antibody or antibody portion of the invention and a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, carrier, and/or excipient. The pharmaceutical<br>
compositions for administration are designed to be appropriate for the selected mode of<br>
administration, and pharmaceutically acceptable diluents, carrier, and/or excipients such<br>
as dispersing agents, buffers, surfactants, preservatives, solubilizing agents, isotonicity<br>
agents, stabilizing agents and the like are used as appropriate.<br>
A pharmaceutical composition comprising an anti-hTNFSF13b human antibody of<br>
the present invention can be administered to a mammal at risk for or exhibiting<br>
autoimmunity related symptoms or pathology such as systemic lupus erythematosus using<br>
standard administration techniques by intravenous, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous,<br>
pulmonary, transdermal, intramuscular, intranasal, buccal, sublingual, or suppository<br>
administration.<br>
The antibodies of the invention can be incorporated into a pharmaceutical<br>
composition suitable for parenteral administration. Peripheral systemic delivery by<br>
intravenous or intraperitoneal or subcutaneous injection is preferred. Suitable vehicles for<br>
such injections are straightforward. In addition, however, administration may also be<br>
effected through the mucosal membranes by means of nasal aerosols or suppositories.<br>
Suitable formulations for such modes of administration are well known and typically<br>
include surfactants that facilitate cross-membrane transfer.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions typically must be sterile and stable under the<br>
conditions of manufacture and storage. Therefore, pharmaceutical compositions may be<br>
sterile filtered after making the formulation, or otherwise made microbiologically<br>
acceptable. A typical composition for intravenous infusion could have a volume as much<br>
as 250 mL of fluid, such as sterile Ringer's solution, and 1-100 mg per mL, or more in<br>
antibody concentration. Therapeutic agents of the invention can all be frozen or<br>
lyophilized for storage and reconstituted in a suitable sterile carrier prior to use.<br>
Lyophilization and reconstitution can lead to varying degrees of antibody activity loss<br>
(e.g. with conventional immune globulins, IgM antibodies tend to have greater activity<br>
loss than igG antibodies). Dosages may have to be adjusted to compensate. The pH of<br>
the formulation will be selected to balance antibody stability (chemical and physical) and<br>
comfort to the patient when administered. Generally, pH between 6 and 8 is tolerated.<br>
TNFSF13b plays a critical role in the pathology associated with a variety of<br>
diseases involving immune and inflammatory factors. Therefore, a pharmaceutical<br>
composition comprising an anti-hTNFSF13b human antibody of the invention can be used<br>
to treat disorders in which TNFSF13b activity is detrimental, for example immune<br>
diseases including autoimmune diseseases and inflammatory diseases. Preferred disorders<br>
include, but are not limited to, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis,<br>
juvenile chronic arthritis, Lyme arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, inflammatory<br>
bowel disease, asthma, allergic diseases, psoriasis, graft versus host disease, organ<br>
transplant rejection, acute or chronic immune disease associated with organ<br>
transplantation, sarcoidosis, infectious diseases, parasitic diseases, female infertility,<br>
autoimmune thrombocytopenia, autoimmune thyroid disease, Hashimoto's disease,<br>
Sjogren's syndrome, and cancers, particularly B or T cell lymphomas or myelomas.<br>
More preferably, a pharmaceutical composition comprising an anti-hTNFSF 13b<br>
human antibody and/or antibody fragment of the invention is used to treat systemic lupus<br>
erythematosus.<br>
The use of the antibody of an anti-hTNFSF 13b human antibody of the present<br>
invention in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of at least one of the<br>
aforementioned disorders in which TNFSF13b activity is detrimental is also contemplated<br>
herein.<br>
In certain situations, an antibody of the invention will be co-formulated with<br>
and/or co-adminstered with one or more additional therapeutic agents that are used in the<br>
treatment of autoimmune and/or inflammatory diseases. Such combination therapies may<br>
advantageously utilize lower dosages of the administered therapeutic agents, thus<br>
avoiding possible toxicities or complications associated with the various monotherapies.<br>
It will be appreciated by the skilled practitioner that when the antibodies of the invention<br>
are used as part of a combination therapy, a lower dosage of antibody may be desirable<br>
than when the antibody alone is administered to a subject (e.g., a synergistic therapeutic<br>
effect may be achieved through the use of combination therapy which, in turn, permits use<br>
of a lower dose of the antibody to achieve the desired therapeutic effect).<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may include a "therapeutically<br>
effective amount" or a "prophylactically effective amount" of an antibody of the<br>
invention. A "therapeutically effective amount" refers to an amount effective, at dosages<br>
and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired therapeutic result. A<br>
therapeutically effective amount of the antibody may vary according to factors such as the<br>
disease state, age, sex, and weight of the individual, and the ability of the antibody or<br>
antibody portion to elicit a desired response in the individual. A therapeutically effective<br>
amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the antibody or antibody<br>
portion are outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects. A "prophylactically<br>
effective amount" refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time<br>
necessary, to achieve the desired prophylactic result. Typically, since a prophylactic dose<br>
is used in subjects prior to or at an earlier stage of disease, the prophylactically effective<br>
amount will be less than the therapeutically effective amount.<br>
Dosage regimens may be adjusted to provide the optimum desired response (e.g., a<br>
therapeutic or prophylactic response). For example, a single bolus may be administered,<br>
several divided doses may be administered over time or the dose may be proportionally<br>
reduced or increased as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation.<br>
Given their ability to bind to hTNFSFl 3b, antibodies, of the invention can be used<br>
to detect TNFSF13b polypeptides (e.g, in a biological sample, such as serum or plasma),<br>
using a conventional immunoassay, such as an enzyme linked immunosorbent assays<br>
(EL1SA), an radioimmunoassay (RIA) or tissue immunohistochemistry. The invention<br>
provides a method for detecting TNFSF13b in a biological sample comprising contacting<br>
a biological sample with an antibody, or antibody portion, of the invention and detecting<br>
either the antibody (or antibody portion) bound to hTNFSF13b or unbound antibody (or<br>
antibody portion), to thereby detect hTNFSFl 3b in the biological sample. The antibody is<br>
directly or indirectly labeled with a detectable substance to facilitate detection of the<br>
bound or unbound antibody. Suitable detectable substances include various enzymens,<br>
prosthetic groups, fluorescent materials, luminescent materials and radioactive materials.<br>
Examples of suitable enzymes include horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, ß-<br>
galactosidase, or acetylcholinesterase; examples of suitable prosthetic group complexes<br>
include streptavidin/biotin and avidin/biotin; examples of suitable fluorescent materials<br>
include umbelliferone, fluorescein, fluorescein isothiocyanatc, rhodamine,<br>
dichlorotriazinyl-amine fluorescein, dansyl chloride or phycoerythrin; an example of a<br>
luminescent material includes luminol; and examples of suitable radioactive material<br>
include 1251, 131I, 35S, or 3H.<br>
Alternative to labeling the antibody, TNFSF13b can be assayed in biological fluids<br>
by a competition immunoassay utilizing TNFSF13b standards labeled with a detectable<br>
substance and an unlabeled anti-hTNFSF13b human antibody. In this assay, the<br>
biological sample, the labeled TNFSF13b standards and the anti-hTNFSF13b human<br>
antibody are combined and the amount of labeled TNFSF13b standard bound to the<br>
unlabeled antibody is determined. The amount of TNFSF13b in the biological sample is<br>
inversely proportional to the amount of labeled rTNFSF13b standard bound to the anti-<br>
hTNFSF13b human antibody.<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention provides a use of an antibody that<br>
neutralizes TNFSF13b activity by binding an epitope of TNFSF13b. The epitope was<br>
identified as described in Example 10. For reference, the soluble portion of hTNFSF13b<br>

another embodiment, the amino acids involved in binding the novel anti-hTNFSF13b<br>
human antibodies comprise asparagine at position 109 and at least one of the amino acids<br>
selected from the group consisting of: lysine at position 71, threonine at position 72, and<br>

The following examples are intended to illustrate but not to limit the invention.<br>
Example 1: Generation of Anti-hTNFSF13b Human Monoclonal Antibodies<br>
Monoclonal antibodies were generated using the HuMAb-Mouse™ technology at<br>
Medarex by immunizing the mice with soluble hTNFSF13b (amino acids 133-285,<br>
purchased from RDI, Flanders, NJ). Both the HCo7 and HCo12 mice were used. Mice<br>
were immunized with 15 µg to 50 µg soluble hTNFSF13b in R1B1, Freund's complete<br>
adjuvant or Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Eight mice producing serum antibody titers to<br>
hTNFSFl 3b were injected i.v. with 10µg hTNFSF13b in PBS. The spleen was harvested<br>
three days later from each mouse and fused with myeloma cells according to the method<br>
described in Zola (Zola, H. Monoclonal antibodies: A Manual of Techniques. CRC Press,<br>
Boca Raton, FL. (1987)).<br>
Hybridomas were tested for binding to hTNFSF13b and to make sure they were<br>
expressing human immunoglobulin heavy and light chains. Antibody binding to<br>
hTNFSFl 3b was detected by ELISA as follows:<br>
Plates were coated with 50 µl of 5µg/ml hTNFSF13b in PBS overnight at 4°C.<br>
Plates were then emptied and blocked with 100 µl PBS + 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) + 5%<br>
chicken serum for 1 hour at room temperature. After washing three times with PBST, the<br>
plates were drained and 100 µl diluted secondary reagents (HRP-HulgGFc, Jackson<br>
cat# 109-036-098 or HRP-HuKappa, Bethyl cat#A80-l 15P; 1:5000 in blocking buffer)<br>
was added per well. After an I hour incubation al room temperature plates were washed<br>
three times as described above. Plates were developed using 10 ml citrate phosphate<br>
buffer pH 4.0, 80 µl ABTS, 8 µl H2O2 per plate. After incubating 30 min. to 1 hour at<br>
room temperature, absorbance of the plates was read A415-A490. Hybridomas that<br>
showed binding to hTNFSF13b and that were huIgG heavy chain and human kappa light<br>
chain were selected for subcloning.<br>
Cell culture media of subcloned hybridomas was concentrated in Amicon ProFlux<br>
Ml 2 tangential filtration systems using an Amicon S3Y30 UF membranes. The<br>
concentrated media was passed over protein-A Sephaose columns (5 to 20 ml column) at<br>
a flow rate of 5 ml/min. The columns were washed with buffer A (PBS, pH 7.4) until the<br>
absorbance returned to baseline and the bound polypeptides were eluted with 50 mM<br>
citric acid, pH 3.2. Fractions were immediately neutralized with 1M Tris, pH 8.0.<br>
Fractions were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing antibody were pooled<br>
and concentrated using an Ultrafree centrifugal filter unit (Millipore, 10 kDa molecular<br>
weight cut-off).<br>
Example 2: Functional Activity of Anti-hTNFSF13b Human Antibodies<br>
Neutralizing activity of the anti-hTNFSF13b human antibodies of the invention<br>
was measured using a murine II-1 dependent B cell line, T1165.17. The cells were<br>
washed three times with assay media (RPM11640 containing 10% FBS, 1 mM sodium<br>
pyruvate, 5 x 10-5 M 2-mercaptoethanoJ and penicillin, streptomycin and fungizone) to<br>
remove IL-1. The cells were resuspended at 100,000 cells/ml in assay media containing<br>
2.5 ng/ml soluble huTNFSF13b and plated at 5000 cells/well in a 96 well plate and<br>
incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2. Supematants from ELISA positive hybridomas were<br>
included at a 1:4 dilution. Forty-eight hours later, 20 µl of Promega CellTiter 96 Aqueous<br>
One Solution (Madison, WI) was added and the plate incubated for 5 more hours at 37°C<br>
in 5% CO2. Absorbance was read at A490, to measure proliferation. An example of<br>
neutralization activity for one of the hybridoma supematants, 4A5-3.1.1-B4, is shown in<br>
Figure 1. As a control, the antibodies were added to IL-1 stimulated cells. There was no<br>
evidence of inhibition of IL-1 stimulated proliferation, only the hTNFSF13b stimulated<br>
proliferation.<br>
The neutralizing antibodies were tested for the ability to inhibit TNFSF13b<br>
augmented primary human B cell proliferation in response to anti-IgM stimulation.<br>
Primary human B cells were isolated from human blood using CD 19 positive selection<br>
using the MACS magnetic isolation system (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA). The B cells<br>
were added to wells of a 96-well plate at 2 x 105 cells per well in complete RPMI<br>
containing 10% FCS (complete RPMI is RPMI1640 containing 10 mM L-glutamine, 100<br>
U/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, 1 mM sodium puruvate, 0.1 mM non-essential<br>
amino acids, and 1 x 10-5 M ß-mercaptoethanol). Some of the wells were coated with 10<br>
µg/ml anti-human JgM in PBS (BD PharMingen, Clone G20-127), overnight at 4°C and<br>
washed four times with PBS before use. Some of the cells were stimulated with soluble<br>
hTNFSFl 3b (25 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of neutralizing anti-hTNFSF13b<br>
antibody (2.5 µg/ml). Figure 2 illustrates the ability of 4A5-3.1.1-B4 to neutralize the<br>
stimulatory effect of hTNFSF13b.<br>
Example 3: Characterization of Monoclonal Antibodies<br>
All of the neutralizing anti-hTNFSFl 3b antibodies were either human 1gGl or<br>
human IgG4. They were also assayed for their ability to bind to hTNFSF13b in a<br>
denatured state, i.e., hTNFSF13b separated on SDS-PAGE and blotted onto<br>
nitrocellulose. All of the neutralizing antibodies failed to bind hTNFSFl 3b in a Western<br>
blot while several of the non-neutralizing antibodies were able to do so.<br>
Experiments utilizing the BIACore system were performed to determine if non-<br>
neutralizing antibodies and neutralizing antibodies bound to the same site on<br>
hTNFSF13b. First, 4A5-3.1.1-B4 was coated onto a chip followed by injection of<br>
hTNFSFl 3b and then a saturating amount of non-neutralizing antibody. Once saturation<br>
was achieved, a high concentration of 4A5-3.1.1-B4 was run over the chip. Eleven of the<br>
non-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies were unable to compete for the same binding site<br>
as 4A5-3.1.1-B4. One non-neutralizing hybridoma was able to block the binding of 4A5-<br>
3.1.1-B4 by approximately 45%, indicating that it may have an epitope near the 4A5-<br>
3.1.1-B4 epitope.<br>
Using the same experimental design, it was also determined that the neutralizing<br>
mAb, 4A5-3.1.1-B4, could compete for the same binding site as one of the receptors for<br>
hTNFSF 13b, TACl. These experiments suggest that TACl-Fc and 4A5-3.1.1-B4 may<br>
have overlapping epitopes on hTNFSF13b.<br>
4 A5-3.1.1-B4 was immobilized on a solid phase by passing the antibody solution<br>
over an IMAC resin loaded with Co+2. Following binding, the cobalt was oxidized to the<br>
+3 state by incubation of the resin with a dilute peroxide solution. After washing the<br>
resin, native hTNFSF13b and hTNFSFl3b that was modified (by reduction/alkylation or<br>
by thermal denaturation) was passed over the column. After washing, the bound protein<br>
was eluted with an acidic solution and the eluted proteins were analyzed by MALDI MS.<br>
4A5-3.1.1-B4 bound native recombinant hTNFSF13b, but did not bind either the<br>
chemically or thermally modified hTNFSFl 3b. Therefore, the 4A5-3.1.1-B4 appears to<br>
recognize a conformational epitope on soluble hTNFSF13b.<br>
Recombinant soluble hTNFSFl 3b (RDI) was incubated with 4A5-3.1.1-B4 or<br>
anti-TNFSFl 3b rabbit polyclonal antibody (MoBiTec, Marco Island, FL; against amino<br>
acids 254 to 269 of hTNFSF13b) on ice for 2 hours and the protein mixture was applied<br>
to a size-exclusion HPLC (two, tandem TosoHaas TSK-GEL G3000PW columns)<br>
equilibrated in PBS at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. Proteins were eluted with PBS. As<br>
controls, antibody solutions and the solution of hTNFSFl 3b were analyzed separately.<br>
Human TNFSF13b eluted from the size exclusion column in a position consistent with a<br>
trimer of TNFSF13b molecules. The elution of trimeric hTNFSFl 3b shifted to an earlier<br>
timepoint in the presence of 4A5-3.1.1-B4 but not in the presence of anti-TNFSF13b<br>
polyclonal antibodies indicating the binding of trimeric hTNFSF 13b to the 4 A5-3.1.1-B4<br>
antibody. This data suggests that the neutralizing mAb 4A5-3.1.1-B4 binds to a<br>
conformational epitope on hTNFSF 13b.<br>
Example 4: Affinity Measurement of Monoclonal Antibodies by BIAcore<br>
The affinity of various anti-hTNFSF13b human antibodies for hTNFSF13b was<br>
measured using a BIAcore 2000 instrument system. The system utilizes the optical<br>
properties of Surface Plasmon Resonance to detect alteration in protein concentration of<br>
interacting molecules within a dextran biosensor matrix. Except where noted, all reagents<br>
and materials were purchased from BIAcore AB (Upsala, Sweden). All measurements<br>
were performed at 25°C. Samples were dissolved in HBS-EP buffer (150 mM NaCl, 3<br>
mM EDTA, 0.005% (w/v) surfactant P-20, and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4). Goat ami-<br>
mouse IgG (Fc specific; Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) was immobilized on<br>
flow cell 1 on a CM5 sensor chip using the amine coupling kit. Goat anti-human IgG (Fc<br>
specific; Jackson Immunoresearch) was immobilized on flow cell 2 also by amine<br>
coupling. Both antibodies were immobilized to reach 700 response units each.<br>
Binding of recombinant hTNFSF13b (Research Diagnostics, Inc., Flanders, NJ)<br>
was evaluated using multiple analytical cycles. Each cycle was performed at a flow rate<br>
of 30 nl/min. and consisted of the following steps: injection of 150 µl of 4A5-3.1.1-B4 at<br>
20 ng/ml, injection of 250 µl of hTNFSFl 3b (starling at 50 nM and using 2 fold serial<br>
dilutions for each cycle) followed by 15 minutes for dissociation, and regeneration using<br>
90 nl of 10 mM glycine HC1, pH 1.5.<br>
Association and dissociation rates for each cycle were evaluated using a Langmuir<br>
1:1 binding model in the BlAevaluation software. The KD of 4A5-3.1.1-B4 for<br>
hTNFSFl 3b was determined to be 38 pM.<br>
Example 5: Cloning and Sequencing of Heavy and Light Chain Antigen Binding<br>
Regions<br>
The variable region for the heavy and light chain for the neutralizing human mAb<br>
4A5-3.1.1-B4 were cloned and sequenced using the following protocols.<br>
mRNA was prepared from 2 x 106 hybridoma cells using the Micro-Fast Track<br>
protocol (Invitrogen) supplied with the kit. cDNA was prepared from 200 µl of ethanol<br>
precipitate of mRNA using cDNA Cycle kit (lnvitrogen) by spinning the aliquot of<br>
mRNA for 30 min. at 14,000 rpm at 4°C followed by washing the pellet with 70%<br>
ethanol. The air dried pellet was resuspended in 11.5 µl of sterile water and cDNA was<br>
prepared following the kit's instructions. The optional second round of cDNA systhesis<br>
was omitted but the cDNA was cleaned using the pheno/chlorform extraction step and<br>
ethanol precipitation. The cDNA pellet was resuspended in 30 µl of TE for use in PCR.<br>
The PCR reactions were set up with degenerate primers at the 5' end of the<br>
variable region for the heavy and light chain paired with 3' primers in the constant region.<br>
For each 50 µl reaction, 1 µl of cDNA was used. The reaction was set up as directed for<br>
use with Pful followed by 20 cycles. The PCR products were checked by running 5 µl of<br>
each reaction on a 1% agarose gel. The positive reactions were cloned using the Zero<br>
Blunt TOPO PCR cloning kit (Invitrogen). Minipreps from the positive clones were<br>
sequenced and analyzed for productive gene rearrangements. Results from independenl<br>
PCR reactions and sequencing of multiple clones revealed the sequences as described<br>
below.<br>
Example 6: Species Crossreactivity of Anti-hTNFSF13b Human Antibodies with<br>
non-human TNFSF13b<br>
In order to determine the species crossreactivity of the neutralizing mAbs, an<br>
ELISA was set up utilizing 4A5-3.1.1-B4 as both the capture and detecting mAb. Human<br>
recombinant TNFSF13b was used as the standard curve. Human TNFSF13b could be<br>
detected in the culture supernatant from CHO cells transfected with a vector expressing<br>
hTNFSF13b, supematants from cultured human monocytes or human serum or plasma.<br>
Supematants from CHO cells expressing murine TNFSF13b were tested for reactivity in<br>
the ELISA and were negative. 4A5-3.1.1-B4 was also unable to immunopreciptate<br>
murine TNFSF13b but was able to immunoprecipitate human TNFSF13b. Murine<br>
TNFSF13b was used in the proliferation assay described in Example 2. Using this<br>
proliferation assay, 4A5-3.1.1-B4 was unable to neutralize the proliferation induced by<br>
murine TNFSF13b. This indicates that 4A5-3.1.1-B4 is unable to recognize murine<br>
TNFSF13b.<br>
Example 7: Amino Acid sequence of Heavy Chain 4A5-3.1.1-B4<br>
Below is the amino acid sequence of the heavy chain 4A5-3.1.1-B4 antibody<br>
which comprises the HCVR and the lgG4 constant region. The human IgG4 constant<br>
region has a serine at position 231. However, this position at 231 was substituted from a<br>
serine to a proline which introduces a structural change in the hinge region for obtaining<br>
optimal inter-chain disulfide bonds. This reduces the generation of half antibodies. Half<br>
antibodies are formed from one heavy chain and one light chain.<br>
In addition, an alanine for phenylalanine substitution at position 237 and an<br>
alanine or glutamic acid substitituion for leucine at position 238 can be made to lessen the<br>
effector function of the antibody.<br>
Example 8: Amino Acid sequence of Heavy Chain 4A5-3.1.1-B4<br>
Below is the amino acid sequence of the heavy chain 4A5-3.1.1-B4 antibody<br>
which comprises the HCVR and the IgGl constant region.<br><br>
Example 9: Amino Acid sequence of Light Chain 4A5-3.1-1-B4<br>
Below is the amino acid sequence of the light chain 4A5-3.1.1-B4 antibody which<br>
comprises the LCVR and the kappa constant region.<br><br>
Example 10: Identification of the Epitope Tor 4AS-3.1.1-B4<br>
The epitope to which 4A5-3.1.1-B4 bound and neutralized human TNFSF13b was<br>
determined. Human and murine TNFSF13b sequences were aligned as shown below:<br><br>
A homology model was created for human TNFSF13b based on the known crystal<br>
structure for several TNF family members. Exposed residues that are different between<br>
mouse and human TNFSF13b are potential binding sites for 4A5-3.1.1-B4 since 4A5-<br>
3.1.1-B4 neutralizes human but not mouse TNFSF13b.<br>
Three potential epitopes were identified: 1) K71, T72, Y73, El05; 2) Q26, S29,<br>
L139, D140; and 3) L53, K55, ES6, K119. Mutagenesis was performed to make chimeric<br>
molecules by changing the amino acid sequence from human to mouse. Chimera A was<br>
L139R, D140N; Chimera B was K71P, T721, Y73F; Chimera C was K71P, T721, Y73F,<br>
E105K; Chimera D was L53V, K55R, E56Q; Chimera E was E105K.<br>
Using the proliferation assay as described in Example 2, all of the chimeras were<br>
tested for functional activity and neutralization by 4A5-3.1.1-B4. Initial assays were<br>
performed using supematants from 293 transient transfections for each of the chimeras<br>
and both human TNFSF13b and murine TNFSF13b parent molecules. All of the<br>
chimeras induced similar proliferation indicating that the chimeras produced were<br>
functional. Using 6 ug/ml of 4A5-3.1.1-B4, 100% neutralization was observed with<br>
human TNFSF13b and chimeras A, B, D and E. No neutralization was observed for<br>
murine TNFSF13b or chimera C. Purified TNFSF13b mutants were produced for<br>
chimera A, B, and C and the assay was repeated using 11 ng/ml of each parent TNFSF13b<br>
or chimera TNFSF13b and 1 ug/ml of 4A5-3.1.1-B4. The results showed 100%<br>
neutralization was observed with human TNFSF13b and chimera A, 88% neutralization<br>
with chimera B, and no neutralization was observed for murine TNFSF13b or chimera C.<br>
Example 11: In vivo studies using 4A5-3.1.1-B4<br>
Transgenic mice overexpressing soluble human TNFSF13b are generated using<br>
established techniques as described by Hogan, B. et al. (1986) Manipulating the Mouse<br>
Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, NY] as modified by Fox<br>
and Solter (Mol. Cell. Biol. 8: 5470, 1988). Briefly, a DNA fragment encompassing the<br>
hTNFSF13b gene is microinjected into the male pronuclei of newly fertilized one-cell-<br>
stagc embryos (zygotes) of the FVB/N strain. The embryos are cultured in vitro overnight<br>
to allow development to the two-cell-stage. Two-cell embryos are then transplanted into<br>
the oviducts of pseudopregnant CD-I strain mice to allow development to term. To test<br>
for the presence of the transgene in the newborn mice, a small piece of toe is removed<br>
from each animal and digested with proteinase K to release the nucleic acids. A sample<br>
of the toe extract is subsequently subjected to PCR analysis to identify transgene-<br>
containing mice.<br>
The hTNFSF13b transgenic mice had a dramatic increase in peripheral B cells,<br>
generally about three fold compared to age and sex matched littermates. There was a<br>
slight increase in peripheral T cells as well. The hTNFSF13b transgenic mice were<br>
treated with 4A5-3.1.1-B4 to determine if neutralization of hTNFSF13b would result in a<br>
reduction in B cell numbers back to normal levels. At 15 weeks old, female hTNFSF13b<br>
mice were injected subcutaneously twice a week for three weeks with either 25 ug of<br>
4A5-3.1.1-B4 or isotype control antibody. Four days after the last injection of antibody,<br>
the mice were sacrificed and the spleen removed for analysis. B and T cell numbers were<br>
calculated by determining the percentage of CD 19+ cells, for B cells, and CD3+ cells, for<br>
T cells using flow cytometry and absolute white blood cell count for each spleen. The<br>
results are shown below demonstrate that in vivo administration of 4A5-3.1.1-B4 to<br>
hTNFSFl 3b transgenic mice is able to restore the normal numbers of T and B cells<br>
(average + standard deviation)<br>
