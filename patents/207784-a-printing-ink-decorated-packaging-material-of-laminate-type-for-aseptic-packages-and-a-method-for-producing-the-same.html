A   PRINTING  INK-DECORATED  PACKAGING  MATERIAL  FOR<br>
ASEPTIC PACKAGES, AND A METHOD OF PRODUCING THE SAME<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a printing ink-decorated packaging material of laminate type for aseptic packages according to the preamble to independent Claim 1. The present invention also relates to a method of producing the printing ink-decorated packaging material according to the preamble to independent Claim 7.<br>
BACKGROUND ART •<br>
Wahin the packaging industry, use is often made of dimensionally stable, liquid-tight packages of a single use disposable nature for packing and transporting liquid foods under aseptic conditions so that the packed food, without the risk of bacteriological or other attack, may be stored for lengthy storage times (so-called extended shelf-life) in the unopened package with retained pristine quality and freshness. A large group of so-called aseptic single use disposable packages is produced from a packaging material of laminate type comprising a core layer of paper or paperboard and other liquid-tight coatings of plastic, normally polyethylene, on both sides of the core layer.<br>
in order to impart to the aseptic package additional tightness properties, for example tightness properties vis-ci-vis light, oxygen gas etc., the packaging material is provided with at least one additional so-called barrier layer between the core layer and one of the two outer, liquid-tight plastic coatings which is intended to face inwards when the packaging material is reformed into packages.<br>
Such a barrier layer may consist of a polymer, for example poly amide, amoung the barrier layer most generally consists of a foil of aluminium (Anfoa) which, apart from superior oxygen gas and light barrier properties, also possesses the advantage that it makes for mechanically strong and bacteriologically tight sealing joints by means of rapid inductive themosealing technique, as a person skilled in the art will be aware.<br>
Conventionally, aseptic packaging material of the type described above produced in that a web of paper or paperboard is coated with outer,  plastic coatings, normally polyethylene, which are extruded on<br><br>
uoilt suies of the web. The plastic-coated web is thereafter provided with an aluminium foil which serves as oxygen gas and light barrier and which is brought together with and bonded to the outer plastic coating on one side of the wco by means of an adhesive applied between the web and the aluminium foil. The web is then coated with one or more additional layers of plastic, normally polyethylene, which are extruded on the foil-clad side of the web for the formation of one of the two outer liquid-tight coatings of plastic described by way of introduction, i.e. that coating which is to face inwards when the packaging material is reformed into packages. The other of the two above-mentioned outer plastic coatings is normally provided with decorative artwork (hereinafter referred to as decor) of printing ink, preferably water-based printing ink, which is applied on the outside of the plastic coating in the desired pattern by means of conventional printing techniques.<br>
From the above-described packaging material, aseptic packages are produced in that both the packaging material and the relevant contents are sterilized prior to the filling operation, whereafter the filling phase is carried out under sterile (aseptic) filling atmosphere in order to avoid reinfection of the sterilized contents.<br>
Nowadays, the production of packages most generally takes place using modern, high-speed packing and filling machines of the type which, either from a web or from prefabricated sheet blanks of the packaging material, form, fill and seal the packages.<br>
Prom, for example a web, aseptic packages are produced in that the web for the purpose of sterilization, is led down into and through a bath of aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution, whereafter the web is dried and reformed into a tube by both longitudinal edges of the web being united wiih one another in an overlap joint seal. The tube is filled with the relevant sterilized contents, for example liquid food, and is divided into closed, filled i?aekarres by repeated transverse seals below the level of the contents in the tube. Tne packages are separated from one another by incisions or cuts in the transverse sealing zones and are given the desired geometric, normally paraiielepipedic configuration, by a further forming and sealing operation for the' formation 01 the finished, aseptic packages.<br>
Printing inks for the described application are most often water-based and therefore require thai ihe surface on which they are to be applied (in this<br><br>
case the one outer plastic coating of the packaging material) is sufficiently hycirophiiic to achieve good adhesion between the printing ink and the<br>
printing surface.<br>
A surface of polyethylene, which is used as the decor-carrying plastic surface ,n the above described prior art packaging material is, however, hydrophobic (water repellent) and must therefore be modified in order to make for the desired good adhesion. For the purpose of promoting adhesion, ihe packaging material is therefore subjected to a surface treatment rnodfiying its polarity which is normally based on the concept that the piasiic surface in question is treated with electric corona discharges (so-called corona treating),-whereby the plastic surface is given the desired hydrophilic character prior to the application of the water-based printing ink decor.<br>
One serious problem inherent in the prior art printing ink decorated packaging material is that at least certain of the printing ink components present in the water-based printing ink tend to interact with hydrogen peroxide when the printing ink-decorated packaging material is led down into and through the hydrogen peroxide bath, as described above. Such an interacdon not only leads to the printing ink d£cor of the packaging material being destroyed ("fading"), but also results in excessively high consumption of hydrogen peroxide because of the undesired interaction.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
One object of the present invention is therefore to obviate the above-outlined drawback in the prior art technique.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to realise a printing ink-decorated packaging material for aseptic packages which is weil-adapted for sterilzation by means of aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution, without the risk of interaction between the printing ink and the hydrogen peroxide leading io a deterioration in quality, and without excessive consumption of hv'ciro-en peroxide.<br>
Vet a further object of the present invention is to realise a printing ink-decoraied packaging material tor aseptic packages which is susceptible to Sterizaling using aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution with retained pristine printing ink quality and with but minimum consumption of  peroxide as compared with the prior art printing ink-decorated<br><br><br>
 a further object o( the present invention is to proauce a priming ink-decorated packaging material for aseptic packages, the packaging material displaying, in addition to good printing properties, particularly good liquid tightness properties.<br>
SOLUTION<br>
These and other objects are attained according to the present invcraion in that a packaging material of the type described by way of introduction has been given the characterizing features as set forth in Claim 1. Advantageous embodiments of the packaging material according to the present jnvention have further been given the characterizing features as set forth in the appended subclaims.<br>
OUTLINE OF THE INVENTION<br>
One explanation for the above described interaction problem, and the intimately related excessive consumption of hydrogen peroxide, may be that the surface treatment carried out for the purpose of promoting adhesion by means oi electric corona discharges (corona treating) is so powerful that it not only generates the intended surface modification of the outer plastic coating of the packaging material (printing surface), but is even so powerful thai the outer plastic coating is "broken up" because of the electric discharges. Such "broken up" regions of the plastic coating have such surface polarity (hydrophilic) that they tend to excessively absorb and retain hydrogen peroxide when the packaging material is brought into contact with the aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution in connection with the reforming of the packaging material into aseptic packages, as described above.<br>
This problem is solved elegantly and effectively according to the present invention in that the printing ink-decorated packaging material is provided with a protective layer of a water-based dispersion of polyethylene or acid-modified polyethylene applied on the decor-carrying outer plastic coating of the packaging material.<br>
A protective layer of water-based polyethylene or acid-modified poiyoiivviene gives ihe printing ink-decorated outer plastic coating an effective protection against printing ink/hydrogen peroxide interaction, at the time it effectively protects such "broken up" regions of the<br><br>
corona-ireat-qd plastic coating against contact with aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution in connection with the sterilization of the packaging whereby consumption of hydrogen peroxide is drastically reduced.<br>
Examples of usable acid-modified polyethylene dispersions for the protectee layer in the packaging material according to the present invention are eriyl acrylic acid copolymer (EAA) and ethyl methacrylic acid copolymer (EMA), preferably ethyl acrylic acid copolymer (EAA).<br>
in another aspect of the present invention, a method is realised of producing the printing ink-decorated packaging material according to the present invention, which is characterized in that the outer plastic coating serving as the decor carrier is coated with an aqueous dispersion of poiyetr.ydene or acid-modified polyethylene by so-called dispersion coating.<br>
dispersion coaling, which is a known coating method, may be  with the printing phase and thus makes for a rational production and distribution of printing ink-decorated packaging material, even if the prinimg ink-decorated packaging material is to be produced in very small series for extremely limited markets.<br>
before precisely, the packaging material production may be carried out in two main stages at separate worksites of which the first or central stage is based on producing a prefabricated material, i.e. a non-decorated but otherwise complete packaging material, in normal industrial production volumes in a central, separate production plant, and from the central plant shipping out such prefabricated material to smaller, local production plants where the non-decorated semi-manufactured packaging material is provided wiih me desired local d6eor and coated with its protective layer by dispersion coating.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Further advantageous characterizing features of both the packaging<br>
rnaterial and the manner of its manufacture according to the present<br>
invention will be apparent from the following description, with reference to<br>
the accompanying Drawings, in which;<br>
rig. 1 schematically shows a cross section of a printing ink-decorated<br>
Packaging material according to the invention; and<br>
Figs. 2A and 2B together schematically illustrate the manner of<br>
manufacture of the packaging material illustrated in Fig. 1.<br><br>
DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Fig. 1 thus schematically shows a cross section of a packaging material according to the invention for so-called aseptic packages of per se known type. The packaging material, carrying the generic reference numeral 10, comprises a core layer 11 of rigid, but foldable paper of suitable packaging quainy for dimensionally stable packages of a single use disposable nature, and outer, liquid-tight coatings 12 and 13 of plastic, preferably polyethylene, on hotn sides of the core layer 11.<br>
between the core layer 11 and one of the two outer plastic coatings 12, the packaging material 10 has a foil 14 of aluminium which serves as the light and oxygen gas  barrier and which, with good adhesion, is bonded to the be layer II by means of an interjacent layer 15 of suitable adhesive.<br>
As is apparent from Fig, 1, the packaging material 10 also has a layer 16 or sealing plastic, preferably polyethylene, applied between the aluminum foil 14 and the outer plastic coating 12 in order to achieve good  between the aluminium foil 14 and the outer plastic coating 12 which, on reforming of the packaging material 10 into aseptic packages, is to face inwards in the package.<br>
The other, outer plastic coating 13 of the packaging material 10 which is also preferably of polyethylene is the carrier of decor 17 of water-based printing; ink as described above, which is applied on the outside of the piastic coating 13 using conventional printing techniques.<br>
The layer 17 of printing ink (the decor) is covered by a protective transparent layer 18 of water-based polyethylene or acid-modified polyemylene, preferably ethyl acrylic acid copolymer (EAA), which, by means of so-called dispersion coating, is applied on the decor layer 17 for protecting the subjacent printing ink on contact of the packaging material 10 with aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution in connection with the reforming of ine packaging material 10 into aseptic packages as described above.<br>
 will further be apparent from Fig. 1 that the packaging material 10, according to a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention, is also edge-covered with a thin layer 19 for protecting the otherwise freely exposed incision edge 20 of the packaging material, in particular the cut incision su rface 11a of the "imbibing" fibre layer 11 of the packaging material 10, As a result of the thus applied edge-covering layer 19, there will be attained  according to the invention a practically entirely liquid-tight<br><br>
packaging material which neither requires extra strips or other complicated modification, for example slicing or edge folding, of the packaging material in order to protect the otherwise permanently exposed fibre edge in the longitudinal overlap joint on the inside of the package, as a person skilled in the art will be aware. The edge-covering layer 19 also contributes in preventing edge imbibing when the packaging material 10 is led down into and through the aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution in connection with the reforming of the packaging material 10 into aseptic packages, whereby the risk of accompanying hydrogen peroxide residues is minimised or totally eliminated.<br>
The edge-covering 19 may consist of the same material and be applied<br>
simultaneously with the d£cor-protective covering layer 18 after and/or in<br>
connection with the decoration of the packaging material 10 with printing<br>
ink.	;<br>
Preferred materials for the edge-covering layer 19 are thus a water-based dispersion of polyethylene or a water-based dispersion of an acid-modified polyethylene, e.g. ethyl acrylic acid copolymer (EAA) and ethyl methacrylic acid copolymer (EMA) which is preferably also applied by dispersion coating in the same stage and with the same equipment as the decor-protective coating layer 18.<br>
The packaging material 10 in Fig. 1 is produced according to the invention by the method which is schematically illustrated in Figs. 2A and 215. In order to facilitate a comparison of the figures, the same reference numerals as in Fig. 1 have been employed for identical or similar packaging material parts and details in Figs. 2A and 2B.<br>
As was pointed out earlier, the method according to the present invention may be divided into two main stages, of which the first or central production stage is shown in Fig. 2A and the second or local production stage is shown in Fig. 2B. In order to avoid misunderstanding, it should however be pointed out that the production stage which is shown in Fig. 2A is conventional while the production stage in Fig. 2B involves characterizing features according to the present invention, and that both of the production stages together make for a rational production and distribution of specifically decorated packaging materials for extremely limited markets, even if the printing ink-decorated packaging material is to be produced in very small production volumes.<br><br>
A web 11 of rigid, but foldable paper is unwound trom a magazine reel IT (to the left in Fig. 2A) and is led via a bending roller 21 through a nip 22 between a pair of cooled press rollers 23, 23 at the same time as both sides of the web 11 are coated with outer coatings 13 and 15 of plastic, preferably polyethylene, which are extruded on both sides of the web by means of extruders 24 and 25, respectively, disposed in connection with the roller nip 22. The plastic-coated web is led via a further bending roller 26 through a nip at 27 between a pair of cooled rollers 28, 28, at the same time as the web is united with an aluminium foil 14 unwound from a magazine reel 14', the aluminium foil being permanently united with the web by means of a layer 29 of suitable adhesive which is extruded between the two webs by means of an extruder 30 disposed in connection with the nip. Thereafter, the web is coated with a first and second outer layer of plastic 16 and 12, respectively, which are extruded on the foil-clad side of the web by means of extruders (not shown) in a per se known manner.<br>
The thus produced packaging material is thereafter wound up on a magazine reel 31 for further transport to a local production plant where the prefabricated packaging material is provided with d§cor of printing ink and is coated with an outer ddcor-protecting layer in accordance with the present invention.<br>
At the local production unit, which may be integrated in a line for packaging production, a web of the prefabricated packaging material is unwound from a magazine reel 31 (to the left in Fig. 2B) and is led through a conventional printing station at 32 in which the packaging material is provided with its desired d£cor of water-based printing ink which, using conventional printing techniques, is applied on the outside of the outer plastic coating 13 of the packaging material in the desired pattern. From the printing station, the thus printing ink-decorated web is led to a coating station at 33 in which the printing ink d6cor (and preferably also the exposed incision edges) of the packaging material are covered with a layer of a water-based dispersion of polyethylene or a water-based dispersion of acid-modified polyethylene which, by means of dispersion coating, is applied in a blanket layer over the printing ink d£cor as well as the packaging material edges for the formation of the finished packaging material 10 according to the invention.<br>
It will thus be apparent from the foregoing description that the<br><br>
previously enumerated objects of the present invention are effectively attained by the printing ink-decorated packaging material and its manner of manufacture, respectively, according to the invention. In particular, the present invention specifically realises a printing ink-decorated packaging material which, unlike similar prior art packaging materials, may be employed with practically any known printing ink* whatever, without the risk that the d6cor - well protected by the outer covering layer - is destroyed in connection with the packaging material being, for the purpose of sterilization, led down into and through an aqueous hydrogen peroxide bath. A particularly advantageous printing ink-decorated packaging material will further be realised if, in the method according to the present invention, the exposed fibre incision edges of the packaging material are also covered by a covering layer applied by dispersion coating, whereby the packaging material becomes particularly liquid-tight and the risk of excessive hydrogen peroxide consumption because of so-called edge imbibing may be eliminated.<br>
It will be obvious to a person skilled in the art that many modifications in respect of the above packaging material details, disclosed merely by way of example, are possible without departing from the inventive concept. Such modifications and alterations thus lie within the spirit and scope of the inventive as this is defined in the appended Claims.<br><br><br><br>
