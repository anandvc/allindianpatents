				<td>This invention relates to a method of manufacture of Asbestos free low heat, low wear composite brake blocks for Railway Coaches &amp; Locomotives by hot compression moulding process- "Previously, these brake blocks were made of Grey Cast Iron to grade Fg220, having the hardness in the range of 180 to 220 BHN. Since, during brake application, metal to metal contact was in force, the tread of the wheel used to wear more rapidly along with the wear of the cast iron brake blocks. Thus, brake blocks and wheel life was reduced necessitating the frequent renewal of both brake blocks and the wheel in the Railway coaches and Locomotives.<br>
The asbestos free low heat low wear composite brake blocks are attached to the brake gear system of coaches &amp; Locomotives for application of braking force to retard/ stop the movement of the rolling stock. There are two types of brake blocks, ( L &amp; K type) which depends upon type of back plate which fits with the brake head for coaching stock , one type each for WDM2 type locos and WDG4,WDP4 type locos This shall have the following main characteristics:<br>
1.	The ingredients of the brake block to be environment friendly.<br>
2.	Low heat generation while braking.<br>
3.	Wear rate should be minimum.<br>
4.	It should not damage the wheel tread.<br>
5.	Cost effective.<br>
6.	Operation &amp; ingredients should be similar to both the type of brake blocks.<br>
The ingredients of the composite mixture shall have the following characteristics:<br>
1.	User friendly while manufacturing.<br>
2.	Should develop wear resistance properties to the brake block.<br>
3.	Should impart adequate density to the brake block<br>
4.	Possesses the required work hardening properties to the brake block.<br>
5.	Possesses heat dissipating properties<br>
6.	Should not have adverse effect on the wheels.<br>
7.	Adequate   control,   in  fixing   the   hardness   of  the   brake   block,   during manufacturing process.<br><br>
8.	Should have the tendency of becoming a solid block of required shape, at a particular temperature &amp; pressure while manufacturing.<br>
9.	Environmental friendly and susceptible for re-cycling.<br>
The asbestos free low heat, low wear composite brake blocks has a holder ( Clip) attached to the steel plate called back plate which in turn is moulded with the ingredients of asbestos free composite material.<br>
This brake block unit is fixed on the brake head through a brake head key and hangs vertically on the wheel thread. Whenever the brake force is applied on the brake head, the brake block unit moves horizontally towards the circumference of the Rail wheel and retards the movement of the rolling vehicle through frictional force.<br>
The method herein has the following advantages :-<br>
That the various ingredients of the composite brake blocks are so selected that the final product has the capability of withstanding the braking force without disintegrating itself, and dissipating the heat generated during the course of brake application quickly and without adversely affecting the wheel tread. The method herein is also streamlined to render it simple, convenient and feasible for mass production. The final product is also absolutely environmental friendly, as it does not cause any kind of pollution during production, storage or application.<br>
The various other feature of this invention will be apparent from the following further description given hereunder in respect thereof<br>
The method of manufacture of asbestos free low heat, low wear composite brake blocks for Railway coaches &amp; Locomotives, according to this invention, comprises of mixing the ingredients in selected proportion as in page 6, placing the cleaned and adhesive coated back plate assembly in the mould, filling the correct quantity of composite material mixture in the preheated metallic mould, closing the mould hydraulically, soaking the entire mould under the temperature between 120-135Â° C and suitable pressure of 40 T for a specified time of 50 Minutes, opening the mould hydraulically , removing the set brake block from the mould , dressing the brake block all round and curing under controlled temperature of 120 C in an oven for a specified time of 24 hrs.<br><br>

The back plate is designed with stiffeners on either side as shown in fig 2 to give extra strength and to eliminate breakage in service.<br>
The back plate and holder (Clip) are prepared separately and assembled together making it an integral part permanently. This is then grit blasted, cleaned further and adhesive solution is applied over the surfaces 'A" as shown in Figure2. The back plate assembly is air dried and kept ready for moulding.<br>
The entire mould is preheated to the required temperature. The mould release solution is applied to the female mould cavity and male mould as shown in Figure 11 to 13.<br><br>
The ready back plate assembly is placed inside the female mould cavity to rest over the bottom male die and properly aligned. The specified quantity of asbestos free composite material mixture is properly filled in the female mould cavity and covered with the male die at the top. The mould is closed hydraulically and the specified pressure is applied through the top die over the entire mould assembly.<br>
The heating and pressure application over the mould is continued for a specified time, allowing the complete setting of the composite mixture in the cavity for getting a homogeneous product of brake block unit. The mould is opened hydraulically and the brake block is ejected out and further dressed to remove the burrs.<br>
The dressed brake blocks are cured in the hot air oven under controlled temperature for a specified period to acquire the required hardness. The brake blocks with the specified hardness are marked with the wear limit line as shown in Figure9.<br>
The mould consists of three parts namely the bottom die, middle female mould cavity and the top male die. The bottom and top male die parts are freely sliding in the female die cavity.<br>
The inner surface of the top male die is suitably designed to accommodate the centre line contact with the wheel tread during brake application.<br><br>
The method comprises of selecting the specific ingredients in the following proportions<br><br>
