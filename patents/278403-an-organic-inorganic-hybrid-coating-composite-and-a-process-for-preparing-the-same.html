				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
This invention relates to an organic-inorganic hybrid coating composite.<br>
The present invention also relates to a process for preparing organic-<br>
inorganic hybrid coating composition.<br>
. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The out of the bath surface of zinc and zinc alloy coatings are highly<br>
susceptible to corrosion. Corrosion products formed on zinc coating are<br>
generally referred to as white rust'. Inorganic chromate passivation is<br>
usually applied directly after galvanizing in line to enhance the corrosion<br>
protection properties of zinc and zinc alloy steel. This technique is widely<br>
applied as an economical method of corrosion prevention.<br>
In recent past a new technology was developed in the post treatment of<br>
galvanized sheets known as "Thin Organic Coating" (TOC) or "Organic<br>
Composite Coating". This coating formulation contains both organic and<br>
inorganic compounds in the formulation.<br>
The prior art mention in United States Patent No. 3036934, 5482787 and<br>
5294485 describe the TOC coating formulations which contains the<br>
chromium compound more particularly, the hexavalent chromium.<br>
However, hexavalent chromium is classified as hazardous substances<br>
(toxic, sensitizing and carcinogenic).<br>
In the present work, the organic coating developed is environmental<br>
friendly. It does not contain any of the chromium compounds.<br>
 <br>

 <br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The objective of this invention is to develop an organic composite coating<br>
formulation that after application on GI surface gives 1 to 9 lam dry film<br>
coating thickness depends on the application method. This coating can<br>
be applied in continuous galvanizing line as a post treatment process to<br>
improve the corrosion resistance performance of the product.<br>
Another objective of this invention is to make the organic composite<br>
coating formulation such that after application on galvanized material, it<br>
not only enhance the corrosion resistance but also give the lubrication,<br>
paint adhesion, anti-finger resistance.<br>
The organic composite coating formulation comprises of styrene acrylic<br>
emulsion, polyurethane dispersion, polyethylene wax, colloidal silica,<br>
zinc oxide, corrosion inhibitors such as zinc oxide (ZnO) and along with<br>
either or the combination of zinc phosphate, sodium phosphate, sodium<br>
phosphate dibasic dodecahydrate etc. The additives such as dispersing<br>
agent, antifoaming agent, antifouling agents etc are used during the<br>
organic composite coating preparation. All the constituents are<br>
commercially available and are collected from different sources.<br>
The organic composite coating formulations made from commercially<br>
available chemicals whose detail is given in Table 1 below.<br>
 <br>
Table 1: The name and basic properties of commercially available<br>
chemicals.<br>
 <br>
The commercial available polymers were diluted before coating<br>
formulation and the diluted polymers was used for the further synthesis,<br>
as per the detail given below.<br>
 <br>
1.	Both the acrylic polymers, Visicryl-7650 and Worleecryl-7120,<br>
contain about 50% of the solid content. This styrene acrylic<br>
emulsion was dissolved in water under high stirring condition to<br>
make 30% solid content and then filtered it with 300 μm filter<br>
cloth.<br>
2.	This commercial grade Polyurethane dispersion, Cytec-1035,<br>
contains 35% solid content. This polyurethane dispersion was<br>
dissolved in water under high stirring condition to make 25% solid<br>
content and then filtered it by 300 μm filter cloth.<br>
3.	The nano scale zinc oxide particle used in this work was below<br>
100 nm in size. Zinc oxide is water insoluble pigment. The nano<br>
zinc oxide was taken and made slurry forms by adding deionized<br>
water with the help of Mortar and pestle and then added dispersing<br>
agent and put in the planetary mill for milling and grinding for 30<br>
minutes for complete dispersion.<br>
Synthesis and application of organic composite coating<br>
The organic-inorganic hybrid coating formulation was made from the<br>
above modified constituents. The constituents were added as per the<br>
sequence mentioned below in Table 2 under mild stirring and then<br>
filtered it by 300 μm filter cloth. The Table 2 given below describes the<br>
coating formulation chemistry.<br>
The above formulation was applied on galvanized sheet samples of size<br>
150x100 mm by dip coating process followed by oven drying at 80 degree<br>
C for 30 minutes. In this process of coating application, 6-8 μm of the<br>
dry film formed on GI surface. The coating properties were evaluated by<br>
simulated corrosion test like salt spray, water immersion and cyclic<br>
corrosion tests, as given in Table 3.<br>
 <br>
Table 2: Formulations (ingredients concentration noted in parts by<br>
weight)<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Table 3- corrosion resistance performance Test procedure of 8 micron<br>
organic coated GI sheet sample.<br>
 <br>
Corrosion performance evaluation<br>
The edges of the sheet were covered by lacquer to prevent the galvanic<br>
corrosion from the edges during corrosion tests. The salt spray test,<br>
cyclic corrosion test and water immersion test were done as per standard<br>
ASTMB117, SAE J2334 and ASTMD823 respectively. The 10% white<br>
rust formation on the sample surface was considered as failure. It was<br>
observed in salt spray test that the example 1 and 2 showed salt spray<br>
test that the example 1 and 2 showed salt spray resistance of 24 and 72<br>
hours respectively. The example 1 contains only the polymer resin where<br>
as the example 2 formulation contains polymer as well as the nano zinc<br>
oxide. The examples 3 to 11 contain corrosion inhibiting compound along<br>
with the resin and nano ZnO that enhance the organic coating<br>
performance.<br>
 <br>
The best performance was observed in example 5 to 8 in salt spray test.<br>
In cyclic corrosion test, the example 2 to 11 passed 1900 hours of test<br>
time. In water immersion test, the example 6 to 11 showed the similar<br>
performance and passed 420 hours in test medium.<br>
Zinc oxide Dispersion technique:<br>
Zinc oxide is water insoluble pigment, it was dispersed by various<br>
techniques. First of all nano zinc oxide was taken and made slurry forms<br>
by adding deionized water with the help of Mortar and pestle and then<br>
added dispersing agent and put in the planetary mill for milling and<br>
grinding for 30 minutes for complete dispersion. Now the calculated<br>
amount of dispersed nano zinc oxide was added in the polymer matrix<br>
while the solution was in stirring condition. The polymer solution was<br>
then kept for ultrasonication (ELMAS 30 H Elmasonic Cleaner bath) for<br>
30 minutes for the breakdown of agglomeration of the nano particles.<br>
Further, the solution was agitated in high speed homogenizer during<br>
stirring and added about few drops of dispersing agent to get the<br>
complete breakdown of and dispersion of the particle in the polymer<br>
matrix.<br>
 <br>
