				<td>FIBROUS SHEET COATED WITH BIODEGRADABLE COMPOSITION<br>
AND ITS USE AS FOOD WRAP<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	The Field of the Invention<br>
The present inven ion relates generally to biodegradable polymers or polymer<br>
blends and sheets manufactured therefrom. More particularly, the present invention<br>
relates to fibrous sheets that are coated or impregnated with biodegradable polymers or<br>
blends that render the sheets more resistant to liquids. The resulting sheets are suitable<br>
for a number of applications, such as disposable wraps, bags, pouches or other packaging<br>
materials.<br>
2.	The Relevant Technology<br>
As affluence grows, so does the ability to purchase and accumulate more things.<br>
Never before in the history of the world has there been such a large number of people<br>
with such tremendous buying power. The ability to purchase relatively inexpensive<br>
goods, such as books, tools, toys and food, is a luxury enjoyed by virtually all levels of<br>
society, even those considered to be at the poorer end of the spectrum. Because a large<br>
percentage of what is purohased is prepackaged, there has been a tremendous increase in<br>
the amount of disposable packaging materials that are routinely discarded into the<br>
environment as solid waste. Thus, as society becomes more affluent, it generates more<br>
disposable trash.<br>
Some packaging materials are only intended for a single use, such as boxes,<br>
cartons, pouches, bags and wraps used to package items purchased from wholesale and<br>
retail outlets. Even the advent of computers and "paperless" transactions has not<br>
stemmed the rising tide of packaging wastes. Indeed, the onset of "e-commerce" has<br>
spawned a great mail-order fad, thus creating a whole new market of individually<br>
packaged and shipped items.<br>
Moreover, the modern, fast-paced lifestyle has greatly disrupted traditional eating<br>
routines in which people prepared their own meals and sat down as a family or group.<br>
Instead, people grab food on the run, thus creating ever-increasing amounts of fast-food<br>
packaging materials that are used once and then discarded. In view of the high volume of<br>
disposable packaging materials being generated, some countries, particularly those in<br>
Europe, have mandated either the recycling of fast food generated wastes or the use of<br><br>
packaging materials which are "biodegradable" or "compostable". Environmental<br>
activists commonly pressure companies that generate solid waste to find more<br>
environmentally friendly alternatives. There is therefore an ever-present need to develop<br>
biodegradable alternatives to nonbiodegradable packaging materials.<br>
Paper, paperboard and other fibrous sheets made from natural cellulose-based<br>
fibers are biodegradable. However, fibrous sheets tend to be porous. As a result, they do<br>
not provide good barriers against water, oil or other liquids. When fibrous sheets are used<br>
in applications where they will be exposed to liquids, they must generally be treated with<br>
a liquid-resistant material, such as paraffin wax or plastic. By doing so, however, the<br>
fibrous sheets are no longer biodegradable, but are as resistant to degradation as plastic or<br>
paraffin wax.<br>
In view of the foregoing, it would be an advancement in the art to provide fibrous<br>
sheets that were resistant to liquids and that were biodegradable. In addition or<br>
alternatively, it would be a further advancement in the packaging art to provide improved<br>
fibrous sheets that were not only resistant to liquids, but still had good breathability and<br>
water vapor transmission compared to conventional fibrous sheets treated with wax or<br>
plastic.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention encompasses fibrous sheets that are coated or impregnated with<br>
biodegradable polymers or polymer blends in order to yield sheets that are more resistant<br>
to liquids (generally "treated sheets" or 'treated fibrous sheets"). The treated sheets can<br>
be used to manufacture a wiere variety of articles of manufacture, including packaging<br>
materials, such as wraps, bags, pouches., cartons, jugs, cups, plates, bowls, trays, platters,<br>
lids, straws, and the like.<br>
Exemplary fibrous sheets that may be treated with biodegradable polymers<br>
include, but are not limited to, tissue papers, paper sheets, felts, paperboard, wovens and<br>
nonwovens. In one aspect of the invention, fibrous sheets are coated or impregnated with<br>
a biodegradable polymer blend comprising at least one thermoplastic biodegradable<br>
polymer having relatively high stiffness and at least one thermoplastic biodegradable<br>
polymer having relatively high flexibility. Thus, the present invention provides blends<br>
that possess or demonstrate surprising syrergistic effects that are particularly well-suited<br>
by use in treating fibrous sheets<br>
For example, blends containing a relatively stiff BIOMAX polymer, a modified<br>
polyethylene terephthalate (PBT) sold by DuPont, and a relatively soft or flexible<br><br>
polymer ECOFLEX, an aliphaic-aromatic copolymer sold by BASF, and/or EASTAR<br>
BIO, an aliphatic-aromatic copolymer sold by Eastman Chemical, have been shown to<br>
have strength and elongation properties which are superior to either biopolymer taken<br>
alone. Other stiff biopolymer:; include; BAK, a polyesteramide sold by Bayer, and<br>
polylactic acid (PLA).<br>
BIOMAX is characterized as having a relatively high glass transition temperature<br>
and is highly crystalline at roo: n temperature. BIOMAX tends to be quite stiff or brittle<br>
when formed into films or sheets. It also has poor elongation or elasticity. ECOFLEX<br>
and EASTAR BIO, on the other hand, are characterized as having relatively low glass<br>
transition temperatures and are relatively amorphous or noncrystalline at room<br>
temperature, all of which contribute to the high softness, elasticity and high elongation.<br>
Even so, various blends of BIOMAX and ECOFLEX and/or EASTAR BIO actually<br>
exhibit higher elongation than ECOFLSX by itself, as well as higher break stress<br>
compared to either BIOMAX or ECOFLEX by themselves.<br>
Other polymer blends that can be used to treat fibrous sheets include, but are not<br>
limited to, a blend of ECOFLEX, PLA and thermoplastic starch (TPS) and a blend of<br>
BAK (a polyesteramide manufactured by Bayer Corporation) and TPS. In each case,<br>
blending a biopolymer havirg a relatively low glass transition temperature with a<br>
biopolymer having a relatively high glass transition temperature results in a polymer<br>
blend that exhibits the desired characteristics of each polymer by itself. In some cases,<br>
the blends exhibit better properties, while diminishing or minimizing the negative<br>
properties of each biopolymer by itself.<br>
In general, biodegradable polymers that may be characterized as being relatively<br>
"stiff or less flexible include polymers tliat have a glass transition temperature of at least<br>
about 10°C. Conversely, biodegradable: polymers that may be characterized as being<br>
relatively '"soft" include polymers that have a glass transition temperature less than about<br>
0°C. "Stiff biodegradable polymers preferably have a glass transition temperature of at<br>
least about 15°C, more preferably at least about 25°C, and most preferably at least about<br>
35°C. "'Soft" biodegradable polymers preferably have a glass transition temperature of<br>
less than about -4°C, more preferably less than about-10°C, more especially preferably<br>
less than about -20°C, and most preferably less than about -30°C. In addition, "stiff<br>
polymers tend to be more crystalline, while "soft" polymers are generally less crystalline<br>
and more amorphous, particularly at room temperature.<br><br>
When a blend of soft and stiff biodegradable polymers is used to coat or<br>
impregnate a fibrous sheet, the relatively stiff biodegradable polymer may have a<br>
concentration in a range of about 20% to about 99% by weight of the blend of<br>
biodegradable polymers exclusive of the fibrous sheet and any fillers. The stiff<br>
biodegradable polymer preferably has a concentration of at least about 30% by weight of<br>
the polymer blend, more preferably at least about 40% by weight of the polymer blend,<br>
more especially preferably greater than, but not including, 50% by weight of the polymer<br>
blend, and most preferably greater man about 55% by weight of the polymer blend.<br>
When a blend of soft and stiff biodegradable polymers is used to coat or<br>
impregnate a fibrous sheet, the relatively soft biodegradable polymer may have a<br>
concentration in a range oi about 1% to about 80% by weight of the blend of<br>
biodegradable polymers. The soft biodegradable polymer preferably has a concentration<br>
up to about 70% by weight of the polymer blend, more preferably up to about 60% by<br>
weight of the polymer blend, 	more especially preferably less than, but not including, 50%<br>
by weight of the polymer blend, and most preferably up to about 45% by weight of the<br>
polymer blend.<br>
Biodegradable polymers used to treat fibrous sheets within the scope of the<br>
present invention include, bu: are not limited to, synthetic polyesters, semi-synthetic<br>
polyesters made by fermentation (e.g., PHB and PHBV), polyesteramides,<br>
polycarbonates, and polyester urethanes. It is also within the scope of the invention to<br>
optionally include a variety oi natural polymers and their derivatives, such as polymers<br>
comprising or derived from starch, cellulose, other polysaccharides and proteins. A<br>
single biodegradable polymer blended with an inorganic filler (e.g., silica or calcium<br>
carbonate) may also be used to treat a fibrous sheet in order to yield a treated sheet that is<br>
more heat resistant.<br>
It is within the scope of the invention to incorporate inorganic and organic fillers<br>
in order to decrease self-adhesi on, lower the cost, and increase the modulus of elasticity<br>
(Young's modulus) of biodegradable polymers used to treat fibrous sheets as well as the<br>
resulting sheets. Examples cf inorganic fillers include calcium carbonate, titanium<br>
dioxide, silica, aluminum oxide talc, mica, and the like. Examples of organic fillers<br>
include wood flour, ground seeds, cellulose particles, polymeric particles, ungelatinized<br>
starch granules, and the like. In addition, plasticizers may be used to impart desired<br>
softening and elongation properties.<br><br>
In the case of fibrous sheets intended to be used as "wraps", such as wraps used to<br>
enclose meats, other perishable food items, and especially fast food items (e.g.,<br>
sandwiches, burgers and desse:t items), it may be desirable to provide wraps having good<br>
"dead-fold" properties so that once folded, wrapped or otherwise manipulated into a<br>
desired orientation, such wrape will tend to substantially maintain their orientation so as<br>
to not spontaneously unfold or unwrap, as occurs with a large number of plastic sheets<br>
and films (e.g., polyethylene). Dead-fold is a measure of the ability of a sheet or film to<br>
retain a crease, crinkle or other bend. It is measured independently of self cling, heat<br>
sealing, or the use of an adhesive to maintain a desired orientation.<br>
Whereas the fibrous sheets themselves may impart or inherently possess dead-fold<br>
properties, polymers and poiylner blends used to treat fibrous sheets may be engineered<br>
so as to have a relatively high Young's modulus, preferably at least about 100 MPa, more<br>
preferably at least about 150 MPa, and most preferably at least about 200 MPa. In<br>
general, increasing the concentration of the stiff biopolymer will tend to increase the<br>
Young's modulus and the resulting dead-fold properties. It should be understood,<br>
however, that Young's modulus only Loosely correlates to dead-fold and does not, in<br>
every case, serve to define or predict the dead-fold properties of a sheet or film formed<br>
from a polymer or polymer blead.<br>
Including particulate fillers within the polymer or polymer blend used to coat or<br>
impregnate a fibrous sheet is another way to increase dead-fold of the resulting sheet.<br>
When used to increase dead-feId, particulate fillers are typically included in an amount of<br>
at least about 5% by weight of the polymer or polymer blend, preferably at least about<br>
10% by weight, more preferably at least about 15% by weight, more especially preferably<br>
at least about 20% by weight, and most preferably at least about 30% by weight of the<br>
polymer or polymer blend usee to treat a. fibrous sheet.<br>
Yet another way to increase dead-fold is to increase the surface area, or "bulk<br>
hand feel", of treated sheets according to the invention. This may be accomplished, for<br>
example, by disrupting the generally smooth, planar nature of the treated sheet, e.g., by<br>
embossing, crimping, quilting or otherwise texturing the sheet so as to have regularly<br>
spaced-apart or random hills md valleys rather than simply being a perfectly smooth,<br>
planar sheet. A treated sheet may be textured, for example, by passing the sheet through<br>
a pair of knurled or other embossing-type rollers. Such texturing increases the ability of a<br>
treated sheet to take and mainain a fold, thus improving the dead-fold properties of the<br>
sheet.<br><br>
The surface area of a treated sheet may also be increased by incorporating<br>
particulate fillers within the polymer or polymer blend used to coat or impregnate the<br>
fibrous sheet in order form surface irregularities within the surface of the treated sheet.<br>
This may be accomplished, for example, by incorporating filler particles, at least a portion<br>
of which, have a particle size diameter equal to or greater than the thickness of the<br>
polymer or polymer blend one or both sides of the treated sheet.<br>
When used to wrap foods, or whenever good dead-fold properties are desired,<br>
treated sheets according to the invention can be engineered so as to have a dead-fold of at<br>
least about 50% (i.e., when creased using a standard dead-fold test, the sheets and films<br>
will maintain at least about 50% of their original crease). Preferably, the treated sheets<br>
will have a dead-fold of at least about 60%, more preferably at least about 70%, more<br>
especially preferably at least about 80%. and most especially preferably at least about<br>
90%. Treated fibrous sheets according to the invention can have dead-fold approaching<br>
or equal to 100% (i.e., when folded such sheets remain folded absent the application of an<br>
external force sufficient to reverse the fold). By way of comparison, sheets and films<br>
made from polyethylene (e.g., for use in making sandwich or garbage bags) typically<br>
have a dead-fold of 0%.<br>
In some cases, it may be desirable for treated sheets according to the invention to<br>
"breath". As set forth above, particulate fillers, both organic and inorganic, can be used<br>
to increase the modulus of elasticity and/or dead-fold. Such fillers can also<br>
advantageously create "cavitaton" whenever sheets or films used to coat or impregnate<br>
fibrous sheets are stretched dufing processing. Cavitation occurs as the thermoplastic<br>
polymer fraction is pulled in either a monoaxial or biaxial direction and the filler particles<br>
create a discontinuity in the flim or sheet that increases in size during stretching. In<br>
essence, a portion of the stretched polymer pulls away from the filler particles, resulting<br>
in tiny cavities in the vicinity of the filler particles. This, in turn, results in greatly<br>
increased breathability and vap or transmission of the sheets and films. The ability of<br>
inorganic filler particles to create cavitation increases as the particle size diameter<br>
approaches or exceeds the thickness of the polymer or polymer blend.<br>
Another advantage of utilizing biodegradable polymers to treat fibrous sheets is<br>
that biopolymers are generally able to accept and retain print much more easily than<br>
conventionai plastics or waxes nsed to treat papers. Many plastics and waxes are highly<br>
hydrophobic and must be surface oxidized in order to provide a chemically receptive<br>
surface to which ink can adhere. Biodegradable polymers, on the other hand, typically<br><br><br>
include a significant fraction of oxygen-containing moieties, such as ester, amide and/or<br>
urethane groups, to which inks can more readily adhere.<br>
The treated sheets according to the invention may comprise single or multiple<br>
layers as desired. The fibrous sheets can be impregnated or coated on one or both sides,<br>
or any portion thereof. Multiple fibrous sheets can be joined or sandwiched together with<br>
one or more layers of biodegradable polymers, and optionally one or more auxiliary<br>
sheets (e.g., metals foils). Fibrous sheets may be coated or impregnated by film blowing,<br>
co-extrusion, casting, and coating techniques known in the art. In one embodiment, a<br>
thermoplastic biodegradable composition is heated to a molten state and then spread over<br>
a fibrous sheet using a doctor blade. In another embodiment, the thermoplastic<br>
biodegradable composition is sprayed onto the fibrous sheet. Thermoplastic<br>
biodegradable polymers used to treat fibrous sheets result in treated sheets that can be<br>
heat sealed to join two ends together to form sacks, pockets, pouches, and the like. They<br>
can be laminated onto existing sheets or substrates.<br>
Notwithstanding the advantages of using biodegradable polymers and polymer<br>
blends compared to polyethylene or other non-biodegradable polymers, biodegradable<br>
polymers tend to have a n.uch lower melt flow index (MFI) compared to non-<br>
biodegradable polymers such as polyethylene, which makes biodegradable polymers<br>
more difficult to spread or spray onto a fibrous sheet. It may therefore be advantageous<br>
to incorporate one or more of water, solvent, or plasticizer, and/or increase the<br>
temperature of the biodegradable polymer or polymer blend well above its softening<br>
temperature or range, but without burning or otherwise harming it, to increase its MFI so<br>
as to facilitate the coating or impregnating process.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, 4-5 lb/1000 ft2 (12-15 1b/3000 ft2) tissue paper is<br>
treated with a biodegradable polymer blond to render it more resistant to penetration by<br>
liquids. Of course, it is certainly within the scope of the invention to utilize any weight<br>
paper or tissue paper, e.g., tissue paper ranging in weight from 8 lb/3000 ft2 up to 60<br>
1b/3000 ft2. One of the benefits of coating or impregnating a fibrous sheet with a<br>
biodegradable polymer or polymer blend, as compared to simply making a sheet or film<br>
from the polymer blend itself, s that the: fibrous sheet core increases the thermal stability<br>
of the resulting article of manufacture. This is beneficial in the case of wraps because<br>
increasing the thermal stability increases their ability to be microwaved without<br>
degrading or melting onto the food that is wrapped therein.<br><br>
5	Increasing the amount of inorganic fillers within the biodegradable polymer or<br>
polymer blend used to coat or impregnate a fibrous sheet also increases the<br>
microwaveability of the resitting wraps. Providing biodegradable polymer wraps that are<br>
microwaveable is an improvement over wraps made using polyethylene, which are<br>
neither biodegradable nor microwave safe.<br>
10	These and other advantages and features of the present invention will become<br>
more fully apparent from the following description and appended claims, or may be<br>
learned by the practice of the invention as set forth hereinafter.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
I. INTRODUCTION<br>
The invention relates to fibrous sheets that are coated or impregnated with<br>
inventive biodegradable polymers or polymer blends. The treated fibrous sheets<br>
according to the invention are in many ways superior to conventional plastics that suffer<br>
from their inability to degrade when discarded into the environment, that are not readily<br>
printable absent special treatment, and that generally have poor dead-fold properties. The<br>
treated sheets can be engineered to have improved strength, flexibility, elongation,<br>
temperature stability, microwaveability, processability, and dead-fold.<br>
In one aspect of the invention, a biodegradable polymer blend used to treat fibrous<br>
sheets includes at least one biopolymer having relatively high stiffness and at least one<br>
biopolymer having relatively nigh flexibility. When blended together, it is possible to<br>
derive the beneficial properties from each polymer while offsetting or eliminating the<br>
negative properties of each polymer when used separately.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, one or more biodegradable polymers used to<br>
coat a fibrous sheet are blended with a significant quantity of an inorganic filler in order<br>
to greatly increase the heat stability of the resulting treated sheet. Fibrous sheets<br>
themselves tend to have greater heat stability compared to sheets and films formed using<br>
biodegradable polymers. Adding an inorganic filler to the biodegradable polymer or<br>
polymer blend (e.g., in a concentration of at least about 30% by weight of the<br>
biodegradable polymer composition used to coat or impregnate the fibrous sheet) further<br>
increases the heat stability of treated sheets according to the invention. In the case of<br>
wraps used to protect food, such wraps can better withstand hot foods and being<br>
microwaved.<br><br>
The treated sheets according to the invention are suitable for use as packaging<br>
materials, such as wraps, bags, pouches, coverings, laminate coatings, cartons, jugs, cups,<br>
plates, bowls, trays, platters, lids, straws, and the like.<br>
Biodegradable polymers that may be used to treat fibrous sheets according to the<br>
present invention include, but are not limited to, synthetic polyesters, naturally derived<br>
polyesters, polyester amides, polycarbonates, and polyester urethanes, but may also<br>
include a variety of natural polymers and their derivatives, such as polymers and<br>
derivatives of starch, cellulose, other polysaccharides, and proteins. Particulate fillers,<br>
both organic and inorganic, n ay be incorporated into the polymers used to treat fibrous<br>
sheets to improve the dead-fold properties, increase bulk hand feel, create cavitation,<br>
reduce cost, and/or decrease self-adhesion of the treated sheets. Plasticizers may be<br>
added to impart desired softer ing and elongation properties. Treated fibrous sheets may<br>
optionally be embossed, crimped, quilted or otherwise textured to improve bulk hand feel<br>
and dead-fold. The biopolymers and biopolymer blends according to the invention more<br>
readily accept and retain print compared to conventional plastics or waxed papers because<br>
they typically include oxygen-containing moieties, such as ester, amide, or urethane<br>
groups, to which inks can readily adhere.<br>
The terms "sheets" and "films" are to be understood as having their customary<br>
meanings as used in the thermoplastic and packaging arts Nevertheless, because the<br>
distinction between what constitutes a "sheet" and what constitutes a "film" largely turns<br>
on the thickness of the article of manufacture; the distinction is somewhat arbitrary (i.e.<br>
some articles may constitute both sheets and films). Because the biodegradable<br>
compositions according to tht invention can be used to manufacture a wide variety of<br>
articles of manufacture, including articles useful to wrap, package or otherwise package<br>
food or other solid substrates, including sheets and films having a wide variety of<br>
thicknesses (both measured and calculated), it is not the intention of this disclosure to<br>
precisely distinguish, in all cases, between what may arguably constitute a "sheet" versus<br>
articles that may arguably constitute a "film". Therefore, when the present disclosure<br>
refers to "sheets and films" and "sheets or films", the intention is to designate the entire<br>
universe of articles of manufacture that may arguably constitute "sheets", "films" or both.<br>
The terms "polymer b end" and "biodegradable polymer composition" includes<br>
two or more unfilled polymers and/or one or more polymers into which one or more types<br>
of solid fillers have been addec.<br><br>
The term "microwaveable" refers to biodegradable polymer compositions and<br>
treated sheets that can be placed together with food into a microwave oven and<br>
microwaved so as to heat the food without the composition melting or otherwise<br>
transferring from the treated sheet onto the food.<br>
II. TREATED SHEETS<br>
Treated sheets according to the invention include any fibrous sheet that has been<br>
coated or impregnated with a biodegradable polymer blend to render the fibrous sheet<br>
more resistant to liquids, such as water, oils or solvents. Specific examples of fibrous<br>
sheets and biodegradable polymer blends that may be used to manufacture treated sheets<br>
within the scope of the invention will now be discussed in greater detail.<br>
A. Fibrous Sheets<br>
It is within the scope of the invention to coat or impregnate various fibrous sheets<br>
known in the art. Examples include a wide variety of tissue papers, ordinary paper,<br>
paperboard, felts, wovens and nonwovens. In one embodiment:, the fibrous sheet<br>
comprises a 12-15 lb/3000 fr tissue paper. Coating or impregnating 12-15 lb/3000 ft2<br>
tissue paper yields treated sheets that ars especially suitable for use as food wraps. It will<br>
be appreciated that it is within the scope of the invention to treat tissue papers and papers<br>
having a wide range of possible weights, e.g., from 8 lb/3000 ft2 to 60 lb/3000 ft2.<br>
B. Biodegradable Polymers,<br>
Biodegradable polymers that may be used within the scope of the present<br>
invention to coat or impregna te fibrous sheets include those which degrade through the<br>
action of living organisms, light, air, water and combinations of the foregoing. Such<br>
polymers include a range of synthetic polymers, such as polyesters, polyester amides,<br>
polycarbonates and the like. Naturally-derived semi-synthetic polyesters (e.g. from<br>
fermentation) can also be use. Biodegradation reactions are typically enzyme-catalyzed<br>
and generally occur in the presence of moisture. Natural macromolecules containing<br>
hydrolyzable linkages, such as protein, cellulose and starch, are generally susceptible to<br>
biodegradation by the hydrolytic enzymes of microorganisms. A few man-made<br>
polymers, however, are also biodegradable. The hydrophilic/hydrophobic character of<br>
polymers greatly affects their biodegradability, with more polar polymers being more<br>
readily biodegradable as a general rule. Other characteristics that affect polymer<br>
biodegradability include crystallinity, chain flexibility and chain length.<br>
Besides being able to biodegrade., it is often important for a polymer or polymer<br>
blend to exhibit certain physical properties, such as stiffness, flexibility, water-resistance,<br><br>
oil-resistance, solvent resistance, strength, elongation, temperature stability, moisture<br>
vapor transmission, gas permeability, and/or dead-fold. The intended application of a<br>
particular treated fibrous sheet will often dictate which properties are necessary in order<br>
for a particular polymer, polymer blend, or treated sheet manufactured therefrom to<br>
exhibit the desired performance criteria. When used to form treated sheets suitable for<br>
use as packaging materials, desired performance criteria may include elongation, dead-<br>
fold, strength, printability, imperviousness to liquids, breathability, temperature stability,<br>
and the like.<br>
Because of the limited number of biodegradable polymers, it is often difficult, or<br>
even impossible, to identify one single: polymer or copolymer which meets all, or even<br>
most, of the desired performance criteria for a given application. This is particularly true<br>
in the area of packaging materials. Polymers that have a high glass transition temperature<br>
(Tg) are often difficult, if not mpossible, to blow or cast into films on a mass scale. On<br>
the other hand, polymers that nave a very low glass transition temperature typically have<br>
relatively low softening and/or melting points, which makes them difficult to mass<br>
produce into sheets and films without the tendency of blocking, or self adhesion.<br>
Moreover, such sheets and films may lack adequate strength, water vapor barrier<br>
properties, high temperature stability, and/or modulus to be suitable for certain<br>
applications, such as in the ma mfacture of wraps or laminates coatings.<br>
In one aspect of the ir vention, it has been discovered that compositions suitable<br>
for coating or impregnating :ibrous sheets can be obtained by blending one or more<br>
"stiff", or high glass transition temperature, polymers with one or more "soft", or low<br>
glass transition temperature, polymers. In another aspect of the invention, polymers or<br>
polymer blends can be filled with particulate fillers, and/or treated sheets or films made<br>
therefrom can be textured, in oder to yield sheets having improved dead-fold properties.<br>
Notwithstanding the benefits that can be derived from using a blend of stiff and<br>
soft polymers, particularly when extruding or blowing films or sheets used to coat fibrous<br>
sheets, it will be appreciated that there are coating methods that do not require the<br>
formation of an extruded or blown film or sheet, such as spreading using a doctor blade or<br>
spray coating. In such cases, it may not be necessary to use a polymer blend. It may be<br>
desirable, however, to use water, a solvent, or plasticizer to increase the MFI to facilitate<br>
the coating or impregnation process. It may be desirable to incorporate a significant<br>
quantity of an inorganic fille (e.g. silica or limestone) in order to increase the heat<br><br>
stability of the resulting treated sheet, In the case of a food wrap, increasing the heat<br>
stability increases the microwaveability of the treated sheet.<br>
1. Stiff Polymers.<br>
Even though the use of terms such as "stiff" and "soft" polymers may be<br>
somewhat arbitrary, such classifications are useful when determining which polymers to<br>
blend together in order to obtain a polymer blend having the desired performance criteria.<br>
In general, those polymers that may be characterized as being relatively "stiff', or less<br>
flexible, typically include polymers which have a glass transition temperature of at least<br>
about 10°C. Stiff polymers will preferably have a glass transition temperature of at least<br>
about 15°C, more preferably at least about 25°C, and most preferably at least about<br>
35°C. The foregoing temperatures attempt to take into consideration the fact that the<br>
"glass transition temperature" is not always a discreet temperature but is often a range of<br>
temperatures within which the polymer changes from being a glassy and more brittle<br>
material to being a softer and more flexible material.<br>
The glass transition temaperature should be distinguished from the melting point of<br>
a polymer at or beyond which a thermoplastic polymer becomes plastic and deformable<br>
without significant rupture. Although there is often a positive correlation between a<br>
polymer's glass transition temperature (Tg) and its melting point (Tm), this is not strictly<br>
the case with all polymers. In some cases the difference between Tg and Tmmay be large.<br>
In other cases it may be relatively small. It is generally the case, however, that the<br>
melting point of a stiffer polymer will typically be greater than the melting point of a<br>
softer polymer.<br>
Preferred "stiff polymlers include, but are not limited to, modified polyethylene<br>
terephthalates (such as those manufactured by Du Pont), polyesteramides (such as those<br>
manufactured by Bayer), polylactic acid-based polymers (such as those manufactured by<br>
Cargill-Dow Polymers and Dianippon Ink), terpolymers based on polylactic acid,<br>
polyglycolic acid and polyoaprolactone (such as those manufactured by Mitsui<br>
Chemicals), polyalkylene carbonates (such as polyethylene carbonate manufactured by<br>
PAC Polymers), and polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB).<br>
A presently preferred stiff biopolymer includes a range of modified polyethylene<br>
terephthalate (PET) polymers manufactured by DuPont, and sold under the trade name<br>
BIOMAX. Various modified PET polymers of DuPont are described in greater detail in<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,053,482 to Tietz, U.S. Patent No. 5,097,004 to Gallagher et al., U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,097,005 to Tietz U.S. Patent No. 5,171,308 to Gallagher et al., U.S. Patent<br><br>
No. 5,219,646, to Gallagher e;. al., and U.S. Patent No. 5,295,985 to Romesser et al. For<br>
purposes of disclosing "stiff polymers, the foregoing patents are disclosed herein by<br>
reference.<br>
In general, the modified PET polymers of DuPont may be characterized as<br>
comprising alternating units of a terephthalate constituent and an aliphatic constituent,<br>
with the aliphatic constituent comprising a statistical distribution of two or more different<br>
aliphatic units derived from two or more different diols, such as ethylene glycol,<br>
diethylene glycol, triethylene oxide, polyethylene glycol, lower alkane diols, both<br>
branched and unbranched, and derivatives of the foregoing. A portion of the aliphatic<br>
units may also be derived from an aliphatic diacid, such as adipic acid. In addition, a<br>
fraction of the phenylene groups within the repeating terephthalate units may be<br>
sulfonated and neutralized with an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal base. Both the<br>
aliphatic portion of the modified PET polymer as well as the statistically significant<br>
quantity of sulfonated terephtlhalate units contribute significantly to the biodegradability<br>
of the BIOMAX polymer.<br>
Some BIOMAX gradf s of polymers have a melting point of 200-208°C and a<br>
glass transition temperature of 40-60°C. BIOMAX 6926 is one such grade. It is a<br>
relatively strong and stiff polymer that, when blended with a softer polymer, yields a<br>
mixture that can readily be formed into sheets and films. In addition, or in the alternative,<br>
one or more particulate fillers may be included in order to impart desired properties<br>
described more fully herein.<br>
In general, modified polyethylene terephthalates that would be expected to have<br>
properties suitable for use as a "stiff biodegradable polymer consist essentially of<br>
recurring structural units havin g the following general formula:<br>
—[—C(O)—R- -C(O)—OGO—]a—[-C(O)-Q—O—] —<br>
wherein up to about 40 mole % of R is selected from the group consisting of a<br>
chemical bond and one or more divalent, non-aromatic, C1-C10 hydrocarbylene radicals,<br>
and the remainder of R is at lee st about 85% mole % p-phenylene radical,<br>
wherein G includes from 0 to about 30 mole % of a polyethylene ether radical<br>
selected from the group consisting of:<br>
—(CH2)2—O—(CH2)2— and — (CH2)2—O—(CH2)2—O—(CH2)2—<br>
and the remainder of G is selected from the group consisting of polyalkylene ether<br>
radicals of molecular weight at least about 250 (number average), and —(CH2)2—,<br><br>
—(CH2)3—, and —(CH2)4— radicals,<br>
wherein Q is derived from a hydroxy acid of the formula:<br>
HO[—C(O)—Q—D—]xH<br>
wherein x is an integer and such, hydroxy acids have a melting point at least 5°C.<br>
below their decomposition temperature, and Q is selected from the group consisting of a<br>
chemical bond and hydrocarbylene radicals —(CH2)n—, where n is an integer from 1 to<br>
5, — C(R1)H—, and —C(R1)HOH2—. wherein R' is selected from the group consisting of<br>
—CH3 and —CH2CH3, and wherein "d" and "b" are mole fractions of the polymer, and<br>
the mole fraction "a" may be 0.6 to 1 and, correspondingly, mole fraction ub" may be 0 to<br>
0.4, and wherein about 0.1 to about 15 mole %, preferably about 0.1 to about 2.5 mole %,<br>
of the polymer contains alkali metal or alkaline earth metal sulfo groups, especially about<br>
1.5 to about 2 mole % of such groups.<br>
Another stiff biopolyrner that may be used in manufacturing polymer blends<br>
according to the present invention includes polylactic acid (PLA). Polylactic acid<br>
typically has a glass transition temperature of about 59°C. and a melting point of about<br>
178°C PLA has low elongaton and is quite hard. It is a strong thermoplastic material<br>
that can be injection molded, extruded, cast, thermoformed, or used as spun or melt-<br>
blown fibers to produce nonwc ven goods.<br>
Polymers based on or including PLA first found commercial application as<br>
medical sutures in 1970. Higli polymers of lactic acid (Mn=50,000-l 10,000) are strong<br>
thermoplastics that can be fabricated into useful products that can be broken down by<br>
common soil bacteria. Potential applications of PLA include paper coatings for<br>
packaging (food and beverage cartons), plastic foam for fast foods, microwavable<br>
containers, and other consume r products such as disposable diapers or yard waste bags.<br>
PLA can be a homopolymer or it may be copolymerized with glycolides, lactones or other<br>
monomers. One particularly attractive feature of PLA-based polymers is that they are<br>
derived from renewable agricu rural products.<br>
Because lactic acid is difficult to polymerize directly to high polymers in a single<br>
step on a commercial scale, most companies employ a two-step process. Lactic acid is<br>
first oligomerized to a linean chain with a molecular weight of less than 3000 by<br>
removing water. The oligome is then depolymerized to lactide, which is a cyclic dimer<br>
consisting of two condensed lactic acid molecules. This six-member ring is purified and<br><br><br>
subjected to ring opening polymerization to produce polylactic acid with a molecular<br>
weight of 50,000-110,-000.<br>
Because lactic acid has an asymmetric carbon atom, it exists in several isomeric<br>
forms. The lactic acid most commonly sold commercially contains equal parts of L-(+)-<br>
lactic acid and D-(-)-Iactic acid and is therefore optically inactive, with no rotatoiy power.<br>
The racemic mixture is called DL-lactic acid.<br>
Another stiff polymer fiat may be used within the inventive polymer blends is<br>
known as CPLA, which is a derivative ofPLA and is sold by Dianippon Ink. Two classes<br>
of CPLA are sold and are refeired to as "CPLA hard" and "CPLA soft", both of which<br>
comprise "stiff polymers", as that term has been defined herein. CPLA hard has a glass<br>
transition temperature of 60°C, while CPLA soft has a glass transition temperature of<br>
5 PC.<br>
Bayer corporation manufactures polyesteramides sold under the name BAK.<br>
Polyester amides manufactured by Bayer are described more fully in U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,644,020 to Timmermann et al For purposes of disclosing biodegradable polymers, at<br>
least some of which constitute "stiff' polymers, the foregoing patent is incorporated<br>
herein by reference. One form of BAK is prepared from adipic acid, 1,4-butanediol, and<br>
6-aminocaproic acid. BAK 1(H5, a polyesteramide having an Mn of 22,700 and an Mw of<br>
69,700 and which contains aromatic constituents, has a melting point of 125°C. BAK<br>
2195 has a melting point of 175°C. Although the glass transition temperatures of BAK<br>
1095 and BAK 2195 are difficult to measure, because BAK appears to behave like a stiff<br>
polymer in the sense that improved properties may be obtained by blending BAK with a<br>
soft polymer, the inventors believe that the glass transition temperature of BAK polymers<br>
is essentially at least about 10 0C. For purposes of understanding the meaning and scope<br>
of the specification and clains, polyestsr amides such as BAK, as well as others that<br>
behave like BAK and can be ised as a "stiff' polymer, shall be deemed to have a glass<br>
temperature of at least about 10°C.<br>
Mitsui Chemicals, Inc. manufactures a terpolymer that includes units derived from<br>
polylactide, polyglycolide and polycaprolactone that have been condensed together.<br>
Thus, this polymer is an aliph itic polymer and may be characterized as a PLA/PGA/PCL<br>
terpolymer. Three grade of :his polymer are available, H100J, S100 and T100. The<br>
H100J grade PLA/PGA/PCL terpolymer has been analyzed to have a glass transition<br>
temperatures of 74°C. and a rr elting point of 173°C.<br><br>
PAC Polymers Inc. manufactures polyethylene carbonate (PEC) having a glass<br>
transition temperature range of 10-28°C. PEC is a "stiff' polymer for purposes of the<br>
present invention.<br>
Polyhydroxybutyrates (FHBs) can act as either a stiff or soft polymer depending<br>
on their molecular weight, whetlier they li£.ve been modified using chain extenders and/or<br>
branching agents, whether the;' have been copolymerized with another polymer, and<br>
depending on the other constituents with it. the overall thermoplastic composition. In this<br>
sense, PHBs are unique amon;; biopolymers and may be of special interest for use in<br>
making wraps, laminate coatings, packaging materials, and the like.<br>
As discussed more fully below, native or dried gelatinized starch can be used as<br>
particulate fillers in order to ircrease the dead-fold properties of sheets and films made<br>
from a particular polymer or polymer blend. However, to the extent that starches become<br>
thermoplastic but retain a substantially portion of their crystallinity, such starches may act<br>
as "stiff, rather than "soft", pc lymers.<br>
2. Soft Polymers.<br>
In general, those biopolymers that may be characterized as being "soft", or less<br>
rigid, typically include polymers which have a glass transition temperature of less than<br>
about 0°C. Soft biopolymers within the scope of the invention will typically have a glass<br>
transition temperature of less than about 0°C, preferably less than about -4Q(O, more<br>
preferably less than about -100C, more especially preferably less than about -20°C, and<br>
most preferably less than about -30°C. The foregoing temperatures attempt to take into<br>
consideration the fact that the "glass transition temperatures" of "soft" polymers are not<br>
always discreet temperatures but often comprise a range of temperatures.<br>
Preferred "soft" biopolymers within the scope of the present invention include, but<br>
are not limited to, aliphatic-aromatic copolyesters (such as those manufactured by BASF<br>
and Eastman Chemical), aliphatic polyesters which include repeating units having at least<br>
5 carbon atoms, e.g., polyhydroxyvalerate, polyhydroxybutyrate-hydroxyvalerate<br>
copolymer and polycaprolactone (such as those manufactured by Daicel Chemical,<br>
Monsanto, Solvay, and Union Carbide), and succinate-based aliphatic polymers, e.g.,<br>
polybutylene succinate (PBS), polybutylene succinate adipate (PBSA), and polyethylene<br>
succinate (PES) (such as those manufactured by Showa High Polymer).<br>
U.S. Patent Nos. 5,817,721, 5,863,991, 5,880,220, 5,889,135, 5,936,045,<br>
6,018,004, 6,046,248, 6,111,(58, 6,114,042, 6,201,034, 6,258,924, 6,297,347, 6,303,677,<br>
6,353,084, all to Warzelhan et. al., and assigned to BASF, disclose a range of aliphatic-<br><br>
aromatic copolyesters within the scope of the invention, as do U.S. Patent No. 6,103,058<br>
to Yamamoto et ai. and U.S. Patent No. (5,120,895 to Kowitz et al. Similarly, U.S. Patent<br>
Nos. 5,292,783., 5,446,079, 6,559,171.. 5,580,911, 5,599,858 and 5,900,322, all to<br>
Buchanan et al. and assigned tc Eastman Chemical, as well as U.S. Patent Nos. 6,020,393<br>
and 6,922,829 to Khemani, also assigned to Eastman Chemical, disclose aliphatic-<br>
aromatic copolyesters within the scope of the invention. For purposes of disclosing "soft"<br>
polymers, the foregoing patents are incoiporated herein by reference.<br>
A preferred "soft" polymer that may be used in the manufacture of polymer<br>
blends includes aliphatic-aromatic copolyesters manufactured by BASF and sold under<br>
the trade name ECOFLEX. The aliphatic-aromatic copolyesters manufactured by BASF<br>
comprise a statistical copolyester derived from 1,4-butanedioi, adipic acid, and<br>
dimethyiterephthalate (DMT). In some cases, a diisocyanate is used as a chain<br>
iengthener. Branching agents may also be used to yield branched, rather than linear,<br>
copolymers.<br>
Copolyxnerization of aliphatic monomers, such as diols and diacids, with aromatic<br>
monomers, such as diols and diacids (e.g., terephthalic acid or diester derivatives such as<br>
DMT), is one way to improve the performance properties of aliphatic polyesters.<br>
However, questions have been raised within the industry regarding the complete<br>
biodegradability of aliphatic-atomatic copolyesters because aromatic copolyesters such as<br>
PET are known to be resistant to microbial attack. Nevertheless, researchers have<br>
discovered that aliphatic-aromatic copolyesters are indeed biodegradable and that the<br>
biodegradability of these copolyesters is related to the length of the aromatic sequence.<br>
Block copolyesters with relatively long Exomatic sequences are less rapidly degraded by<br>
microorganisms compared to random copolyesters having more interrupted aromatic<br>
sequences. Film thickness is also a factor, with thicker films degrading more slowly due<br>
to their reduced surface to volume ratio than thinner films, al] things being equal. The<br>
polymer presently sold under the name ECOFLEX S BX 7000 by BASF has a glass<br>
transition temperature of-33°C. and a melting range of 105-115oC.<br>
Another "soft" aliphatic-aromatic copolyester is manufactured by Eastman<br>
Chemical Company and is sald under the trade name EASTAR. BIO. The aliphatic-<br>
aromatic copolyester manufadured by Eastman is a random copolymer derived from 1,4-<br>
butanediol, adipic acid, and dimethyiterephthalate (DMT). One particular grade of<br>
EASTAR BIO, known as EASTAR BIO 14766, has a glass transition temperature of<br>
-33°C and a melting point oi 112°C. I: has a tensile strength at break in the machine<br><br>
direction of 19 MPa, an elongation at break of 600%, and a tensile modulus of elasticity<br>
of 97 MPa (tangent). It has an Blmendorf tsar strength of 282 g.<br>
Polycaprolactone (PCL) is a biodegradable aliphatic polyester having a relatively<br>
low melting point and a very to v glass transition temperature. It is so named because it is<br>
formed by polymerizing -caprolactone. The glass transition temperature of PCL is<br>
-60°C. and the melting point is only 60°C. Because of this PCL and other similar<br>
aliphatic polyesters with low melting points are difficult to process by conventional<br>
techniques such as film blowing and blow molding. Films made from PCL are tacky as<br>
extruded and have low melt strength over 130°C. Also, the slow crystallization of this<br>
polymer causes the properties to change over time. Blending PCL with other polymers<br>
improves the processability of PCL. One common PCL is TONE, manufactured by<br>
Union Carbide. Other manufactures of PCL include Daicel Chemical, Ltd. and Solvay.<br>
Though the use of PCL is certainly within the scope of the invention, it is currently a less<br>
preferred soft biopolymer that aliphatic-aromatic polyesters, which give overall better<br>
performance.<br>
e-Caprolactone is a seven member ring compound that is characterized by its<br>
reactivity. Cleavage usually takes placs at the carbonyl group. e-Caprolactone is<br>
typically made from cyclohexanone by a peroxidation process. PCL is a polyester made<br>
by polymerizing e-caprolactone. Higher molecular weight PCL may be prepared under<br>
the influence of a wide variey of catalysts, such as aluminum alkyls, organometallic<br>
compositions, such as Group I;, IIa, IIb, or IIIa metal alkyls, Grignard reagents, Group II<br>
metal dialkyls, calcium or other metal amides or alkyl amides, reaction products of<br>
alkaline earth hexamoniates, alkaline oxides and acetonitrile, aluminum trialkoxides,<br>
alkaline earth aluminum or boron hydrides, alkaline metal or alkaline earth hydrides or<br>
alkaline metals alone. PCL is typically prepared by initiation with an aliphatic diol (HO-<br>
R-OH), which forms a terminal end group.<br>
Another "soft" aliphatic polyester that may be used in manufacturing the inventive<br>
polymer blends is polyhydroxybutyrate-hydroxyvalerate copolymer (PHBV), which is<br>
manufactured using a microbial-induced fermentation process. One such PHBV<br>
copolyester, manufactured by the Monsanto Company, has a glass transition temperature<br>
of about 0°C. and a melting point of about 170°C. If possible, PHBV copolyesters should<br>
be formulated and/or modified so as have a glass transition temperature less than about<br>
-5°C.<br><br>
In the fermentation process used to manufacture PHBV, a single bacterium<br>
species converts corn and potato feed stocks into a copolymer of polyhydroxybutyrate<br>
and hydroxyvalerate constituent;. By manipulating the feed stocks, the proportions of the<br>
two polymer segments can be varied to make different grades of material. All grades are<br>
moisture resistant while still being fully biodegradable. The world producers of PHBV<br>
are Monsanto, with its BIOPOL., product, and METABOLIX, with its various grades of<br>
polyhydroxy-alkanqates (PHAs). Polyhydroxyvalerate (PHV) is also an example of a<br>
"soft" polymer.<br>
As set forth above, polyhydroxybutyrates (PHBs) can act as either a stiff or soft<br>
polymer depending on their molecular weight, whether they have been modified using<br>
chain extenders and/or branch ,ng agents, whether they have been copolymerized with<br>
another polymer, and depending on the other constituents within the overall thermoplastic<br>
composition. In this sense, PFIBs are unique among biopolymers and may be of special<br>
interest for use in making wrap laminate coatings, packaging materials, and the like.<br>
Another class of "soft" aliphatic polyesters are based on repeating succinate units<br>
such as polybutylene succinate (PBS), polybutylene succinate adipate (PBSA), and<br>
polyethylene succinate (PBS). Each of these succmate-based aliphatic polyesters are<br>
manufactured by Showa High Polymer, Ltd. and are sold under the trade name<br>
BIONELLE. PBS (Bionolle 001) has a glass transition temperature of-30°C. and a<br>
melting point of 114°C. PBSA (Bionolle 3001) has a glass transition temperature of<br>
-35°C. and a melting point of 95°C. PES (Bionolle 6000) has a glass transition<br>
temperature of ~4°C. and a melting point of 102° .<br>
The target applications for BIONOLLE include films, sheets, filaments, foam-<br>
molded products and foam-expanded products. BIONOLLE is biodegradable in compost,<br>
in moist soil, in water with act vated sludge, and in sea water. PBSA degrades rapidly in<br>
a compost environment, so it s similar to cellulose, whereas PBS degrades less rapidly<br>
and is similar to newspaper in terms of biodegradation.<br>
BIONOLLE is manufactured according to a patented two-step process of<br>
preparing succinate aliphatic polyesters with high molecular weights and useful physical<br>
properties. In a first step, a low molecular weight hydroxy-terminated aliphatic polyester<br>
prepolymer is made from a glycol and an aliphatic dicarboxylic acid. This<br>
polymerization is catalyzed by a titanium catalyst such as tetraisopropyltitanate,<br>
tetraisopropoxy titanium, dibutoxydiacetoacetoxy titanium, or tetrabutyltitanate. In the<br><br>
second step, a high molecular weidght polyester is made by reacting a diisocyanate, such<br>

Finally, although starch, such as modified starch or starch that has been<br>
gelatinized with water and subsequently dried, is known to have a high glass transition<br>
temperature (i.e., 70-85°C.) and be very crystalline at room temperature, certain forms of<br>
starch in which the crystallinity 1 as been greatly reduced or destroyed altogether can have<br>
very low glass transition temperatures and may, in fact, constitute "soft" biodegradable<br>
polymers within the scope of the invention. As discussed more fully below, native or<br>
dried gelatinized starch can be u; ;ed as particulate fillers in order to increase the dead-fold<br>
properties of sheets and films made from a particular polymer or polymer blend.<br>
Moreover, to the extent that starches become thermoplastic but retain a substantially<br>
portion of their crystallinity, such starches may act as "stiff, rather than "soft", polymers.<br>
Nevertheless, there exists a range of thermoplastic starch polymers that can behave as<br>
"soft" polymers.<br>
For example, U.S. Paten: No. 5,362,777 to Tomka is a landmark patent and was<br>
the first attempt to manufactun what is known as thermoplastically processable starch<br>
(TPS). TPS is characterized a: a thermoplastic starch polymer formed by mixing and<br>
heating native or modified stareh in the presence of an appropriate high boiling plasticizer<br>
(such as glycerin and sorbitol) in a manner such that the starch has little or no<br>
crystallinity, a low glass transition temperature, and very low water (less than 5%,<br>
preferably less than about 1% bv weight while in a melted state after venting and prior to<br>
conditioning). When blended with appropriate hydrophobic polymers, such as the stiff<br>
polymers disclosed herein, e.g., polyesteramides such as BAK, TPS can have a glass<br>
transition temperature as low as -60°C, and typically below about -20°C.<br><br>
Although it is within the : cope of the invention to include thermoplastic polymers<br>
based on starch that include plas icizers such as glycerine, sorbitol, propylene glycol and<br>
the like, it is preferable, when manufacturing packaging materials that will come into<br>
contact with food products, to ut lize therraoplastic starch polymers that are made without<br>
the use of such plasticizers, which can potentially diffuse into food. Preferred<br>
thermoplastic starch polymers for use in making food wraps may advantageously utilize<br>
the natural water content of naive starch granules to initially break down the granular<br>
structure and melt the native starch. Thereafter, the melted starch can be blended with<br>
one or more synthetic biopolyners, and the mixture dried by venting, in order to yield a<br>
final polymer blend. Where is desired to make food wraps or other sheets or films<br>
intended to contact food using a thermoplastic starch polymer made with a high boiling<br>
liquid plasticizer, it will be preferable to limit the quantity of such thermoplastic starch<br>
polymers to less than 10% by weight of the polymer mixture, exclusive of any solid<br>
fillers.<br>
C. OTHER COMPONENTS<br>
There are a number of optional components which may be included within the<br>
biodegradable polymer blends in order to impart desired properties. These include, but<br>
are not limited to, plasticizers. lubricants., fillers, natural polymers and nonbiodegradable<br>
polymers.<br>
1. Plasticizers and Lubricants.<br>
Plasticizers and lubncants may optionally be added in order to improve<br>
processing, such as extrusion film blowing, spreading or spraying, or final mechanical<br>
properties, particularly of polymer blends that are relatively stiff. A stiffer polymer blend<br>
may be dictated by other performancs criteria, such as high temperature stability,<br>
strength, lower elongation, higher dead-fold, resistance to "blocking" during and after<br>
processing, and the like. In such cases, a plasticizer may allow the polymer blend to<br>
satisfy certain processing and/or performance criteria.<br>
In the case where a biodegradable polymer or polymer blend is spread or sprayed<br>
onto a fibrous sheet, it may be advantageous to use a plasticizer to increase the melt flow<br>
index (MFI) of the molten polymer or polymer blend. Increasing the MFI of a molten<br>
polymer or polymer blend facilitates high speed coating. In general, when certain<br>
biodegradable polymers are heated to above their softening point, they have an MFI<br>
between about 2-10 g/10 mia. Increasing the MFI preferably to at least about 40 g/10<br>
min., more preferably to at least about 70 g/10 min., and most preferably to at least about<br><br>
100 g/10 min. greatly facilitates spreading or spraying a molten biodegradable polymer<br>
blend.<br>
Suitable plasticizers wthin the scope of the invention, particularly when<br>
incorporated into a polymer blend that is intended to be used in the manufacture of wraps<br>
and other packaging materials that will come into contact with food, will preferably be<br>
safe if consumed, at least in smaller quantities.<br>
Exemplary plasticizers that may be used in accordance with the present invention<br>
include, but are not limited to, soybean oil, caster oil, TWEEN 20, TWEEN 40, TWEEN<br>
60, TWEEN 80, TWEEN 85, sorbitan monolaurate, sorbitan monooleate, sorbitan<br>
monopalmitate, sorbitan trioleat s, sorbitan monostearate, PEG, derivatives of PEG, N,N-<br>
ethylene bis-stearamide, N,N-ethylene bis-oleamide, polymeric plasticizers such as<br>
poly(l,6-hexamethylene adipate), and other compatible low molecular weight polymers.<br>
Examples of lubricants include salts of fatty acids, an example of which is<br>
magnesium stearate.<br>
Volatile plasticizers that can be removed during or after the coating process, such<br>
as water or volatile solvents, may be used to facilitate high speed coating. Examples of<br>
volatile solvents that may be used, preferably by recovering and reusing such solvents,<br>
include, but are not limited to, chloroform, methylene chloride, other chlorinated<br>
hydrocarbons, ethyl alcohol, sopropyl alcohol, other alcohols, acetone, methyl ethyl<br>
ketone, other ketones, and the like.<br>
It has been found, for e cample, that including 200 ppm water increases the MFI of<br>
a molten biodegradable polymer composition from 4 g/10 min. to about 40 g/10 min.<br>
Whereas many of the biodegrmdable polymers described herein are "hydrophobic" in the<br>
sense that they do not dissolve or degrade when exposed to water at room temperature,<br>
they do contain polar moieties that greatly increase the affinity of such polymers for water<br>
while heated to a molten state Thus, it is possible to blend some amount of water within<br>
molten a biodegradable polyner that would otherwise be hydrophobic when cooled to<br>
room temperature.<br>
2. Solid Fillers.<br>
Particulate fillers may optionally be added for a number of reasons, including but<br>
not limited to, increasing the Young's modulus, dead-fold properties, rigidity,<br>
breathability, thermal stability, microwaveability, and insulating ability, and for<br>
decreasing the cost and tendency of the polymer blend to "block" or self-adhere during<br>
processing. Other fillers, like fibers having a high aspect ratio, may increase the strength,<br><br>
fracture energy and dead-fold properties of the sheets and films according to the<br>
invention. In general, fillers within the scope of the invention will generally fall within<br>
three classes or categories: (1) inorganic paniculate fillers, (2) fibers and (3) organic<br>
fillers.<br>
a. Inorganic Particulate Fillers<br>
The terms "particle" or' particulate filler" should be broadly interpreted to include<br>
filler particles having any of a variety of different shapes and aspect ratios. In general,<br>
"particles" are those solids having an aspect ratio (i.e., the ratio of length to thickness) of<br>
less than about 10:1. Solids heving an aspect ratio greater than about 10:1 may be better<br>
understood as "fibers", as that tsrm will be defined and discussed hereinbelow.<br>
Virtually any known filler, whether inert or reactive, can be incorporated into the<br>
biodegradable polymer blends. In general, adding an inorganic filler will tend to reduce<br>
the cost of the resulting polymer blend. If a relatively small amount of inorganic filler is<br>
used, the effects on the properties of the final composition are minimized, while adding a<br>
relatively large amount of inorganic filler will increase those effects. In those cases<br>
where adding the inorganic filler will tend to detract from a critical physical parameter,<br>
such as tensile strength or flexibility, only so much of the filler should be added in order<br>
to reduce the cost of the res uiting composition, while retaining adequate mechanical<br>
properties required by the in;ended use. However, in those cases where adding the<br>
inorganic filler will improve one or more desired physical properties of a given<br>
application, such as stiffness, compressive strength, dead-fold, heat resistance,<br>
microwaveability, insulating ability, and/or breathability, it may be desirable to increase<br>
the quantity of added filler in order to provide this desired property while also proving<br>
greatly decreased cost.<br>
It will be appreciated 1 hat one of ordinary skill in the art, using a microstructural<br>
engineering approach, can self ct the types and amount of the various inorganic fillers that<br>
may be included within the pc lymer blend in order to engineer a final material having the<br>
desired properties while taking advantage of the cost-reducing properties of adding the<br>
inorganic filler.<br>
In general, in order to maximize the quantity of inorganic filler while minimizing<br>
the deleterious mechanical effects of adding the filler as much as possible, it may be<br>
advantageous to select filler p articles in a manner that decreases the specific surface area<br>
of the particles. The specifie surface area is defined as the ratio of the total particle<br>
surface area versus the total particle volume. One way to decrease the specific surface<br><br>
area is to select particles that ha ve a more uniform surface geometry. The more jagged<br>
and irregular the particle surface geometry, the greater will be the ratio of surface area to<br>
volume of that particle. Another way to decrease the specific surface area is to increase<br>
the particle size. In view of the advantages of decreasing the specific surface area of the<br>
inorganic filler, it will be preferable to include inorganic filler particles having a specific<br>
surface area in a range fiom about 0.1 m2/g to about 400 m2/g, more preferably in range<br>
from about 0.15 m2/g to about 50 m2/g, and most preferably in a range from about 0.2<br>
m2/g to about 2 m2/g.<br>
Related to decreased specific surface area in improving the rheology and final<br>
strength properties of the polymer blends of the present invention is the concept of<br>
particle packing. Particle packing techniques allow for a reduction in "wasted" interstitial<br>
space between particles while maintaining adequate particle lubrication and, hence,<br>
mixture rheology, within the melted polymer blend, while also allowing for more efficient<br>
use of the thermoplastic phase as a binder in the final hardened polymer blends of the<br>
present invention. Simply stated, particle packing is the process of selecting one or more<br>
ranges of particle sizes in order that the spaces between larger particles are substantially<br>
occupied by a selected group c f smaller particles.<br>
In order to optimize the packing density of the inorganic filler particles,<br>
differently sized particles having sizes ranging from as small as about 0.01 micron to as<br>
large as about 2 mm may be used. Of course, the thickness and other physical parameters<br>
of the desired article to be manufactured from any given polymer blend may often dictate<br>
the upper particle size limit, in general, the particle packing will be increased whenever<br>
any given set of particles is m.xed with another set of particles having an average particle<br>
size (i.e., width and/or length) that is at least about 2 times bigger or smaller than the<br>
average particle size of the f rst group of particles. The particle packing density for a<br>
two-particle system will be rr aximized whenever the size ratio of a given set of particles<br>
is from about 3-10 times the size of another set of particles. Similarly, three or more<br>
different sets of particles may be used to further increase the particle packing density.<br>
The degree of packing; density that will be "optimal" will depend on a number of<br>
factors including, but not imited to, the types and concentrations of the various<br>
components within both the thermoplastic phase and the solid filler phase, the shaping<br>
method that will be employed, and the desired mechanical and other performance<br>
properties of the final articles to be manufactured from a given polymer blend. One of<br>
ordinary skill in the art will be able to determine the optimal level of particle packing that<br><br>
will optimize the packing density through routine testing. A more detailed discussion of<br>
particle packing techniques can be found in U.S. Patent No. 5,527,387 to Andersen et al.<br>
For purposes of disclosing particle packing techniques that may be useful in maximizing<br>
or optimizing particle packing density, the foregoing patent is incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
In those cases where it is desired to take advantage of the improved properties of<br>
rheology and binding efficiency utilizing particle packing techniques, it will be preferable<br>
to include inorganic filler part c[es having a natural particle packing density in a range<br>
from about 0.55 to about 0.95, more preferably in range from about 0.6 to about 0.9, and<br>
most preferably in a range from about 0.7 to about 0.85.<br>
Examples of useful inorganic fillers that may be included within the<br>
biodegradable polymer blends include such disparate materials as sand, gravel, crushed<br>
rock, bauxite, granite, limestone, sandstone, glass beads, aerogels, xerogels, mica, clay,<br>
alumina, silica, kaolin, micrcspheres, hollow glass spheres, porous ceramic spheres,<br>
gypsum dihydrate, insoluble salts, calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, calcium<br>
hydroxide, calcium aluminate, magnesium carbonate, titanium dioxide, talc, ceramic<br>
materials, pozzolanic materials, salts, zirconium compounds, xonotlite (a crystalline<br>
calcium silicate gel), lightweight expanded clays, perlite, vermiculite, hydrated or<br>
unhydrated hydraulic cement particles, pumice, zeolites, exfoliated rock, ores, minerals,<br>
and other geologic materials. A wide variety of other inorganic fillers may be added to<br>
the polymer blends, including materials such as metals and metal alloys (e.g., stainless<br>
steel, iron, and copper), balls or hollow spherical materials (such as glass, polymers, and<br>
metals), filings, pellets, flakes and powders (such as mierosilica).<br>
The particle size or range of particle sizes of the inorganic fillers will depend on<br>
the wall thickness of the film sheet, or other article that is to be manufactured from the<br>
polymer blend. In general, the larger the wall thickness, the larger will be the acceptable<br>
particle size. In most cases, it will be preferable to maximize the particle size within the<br>
acceptable range of particle sizes for a. given application in order to reduce the cost and<br>
specific surface area of the inorganic filler. For films that are intended to have a<br>
substantial amount of flexibility, tensile: strength, bending endurance and relatively low<br>
dead-fold and breathability (e.g., plastic bags) the particle size diameter of the inorganic<br>
filler will preferably be less than about 20% of the wall thickness of the film. For<br>
example, for a film or sheet having a thickness of 40 microns, it may be preferable for the<br>
inorganic filler particles to have a particle size diameter of about 8 microns or less.<br><br>
On the other hand, it may be desirable in some cases for at least a portion of the<br>
filler particles to have a larger particle size diameter, such as a diameter that is equal to or<br>
greater than the thickness of the polymeric sheet or film. Utilizing filler particles whose<br>
diameters equal or exceed the th chiess of the polymeric sheet or film disrupts the surface<br>
of the sheet or film and increases the surface area, which can advantageously increase the<br>
bulk-hand-feel and/or dead-folo. properties of the sheet or film. In the case where the<br>
sheets or films are mono or biaxial stretched, the use of larger filler particles (e.g., larger<br>
than 20% of the wall thickness of the film) creates definitive discontinuities that yield<br>
sheets and films having a high degree of cavitation. Cavitation results in sheets having a<br>
touch and feel that more closely resembles the touch and feel of paper. In addition, it<br>
greatly increases the breathabilty and waiter vapor transmission of the sheets and films.<br>
The amount of particulate filler added to a polymer blend will depend on a variety<br>
of factors, including the quantiy and identities of the other added components, as well as<br>
the specific surface area, packing density, and/or size distribution of the filler particles<br>
themselves. Accordingly, the concentration of particulate filler within the polymer blends<br>
may be included in a broad range from a:; low as 0% by volume to as high as about 90%<br>
by volume of the polymer blend. Because of the variations in density of the various<br>
inorganic fillers than can be used, it may be more correct in some instances to express the<br>
concentration of the in organ c filler in terms of weight percent rather than volume<br>
percent. In view of this, the inorganic filler components can be included within a broad<br>
range from as low as 0% by veight to as high as 95% by weight of the polymer blend,<br>
preferably in a range from about 5% to about 90% by weight.<br>
In those cases where is desired for the properties of the thermoplastic phase to<br>
predominate due to the required performance criteria of the articles being manufactured,<br>
the inorganic filler will prefeiably be included in an amount in a range from about 5% to<br>
about 50% by volume of polymer blend. On the other hand, where it is desired to create<br>
highly inorganically filled systems, the inorganic filler will preferably be included in an<br>
amount in a range from about 50% to about 90% by volume.<br>
In light of these competing objectives, the actual preferred quantity of inorganic<br>
filler may vary widely. In general terms, however, in order to appreciably decrease the<br>
cost of the resulting polymer blend and/or to impart increased dead-fold, heat-resistance,<br>
insulation ability, and/or microwaveability, the inorganic filler component will typically<br>
be included in an amount of at least about 10% by weight of the overall composition,<br>
preferably at least about 15% by weight, more preferably at least about 20% by weight,<br><br>
more especially preferably at least about 30% by weight, and most preferably at least<br>
about 35% by weight of the ove: all composition.<br>
b. Discrete Fibers<br>
In addition to the fibrous sheet being treated, discrete fibers can optionally be used<br>
in order to improve the physical properties of the polymer blends. Like the<br>
aforementioned fillers, fibers will typically constitute a solid phase that is separate and<br>
distinct from the thermoplastic phase. However, because of the shape of fibers, i.e., by<br>
having an aspect ratio greater than at least about 10:1, they are better able to impart<br>
strength and toughness than particulate fillers. As used in the specification and the<br>
appended claims, the terms "fioers" and "fibrous material" include both inorganic fibers<br>
and organic fibers. Fibers may be added to the moldable mixture to increase the<br>
flexibility, ductility, bendability, cohesion, elongation ability, deflection ability,<br>
toughness, dead-fold, and fraclure energy, as well as the flexural and tensile strengths of<br>
the resulting sheets and articles.<br>
Fibers that may be incorporated into the polymer blends include naturally<br>
occurring organic fibers, such as cellulosic fibers extracted from wood, plant leaves, and<br>
plant stems. In addition, inorganic fibers made from glass, graphite, silica, ceramic, rock<br>
wool, or metal materials may also be used. Preferred fibers include cotton, wood fibers<br>
(both hardwood or softwood :fibers, examples of which include southern hardwood and<br>
southern pine), flax, abaca, sisal, ramie, hemp, and bagasse because they readily<br>
decompose under normal conditions. Even recycled paper fibers can be used in many<br>
cases and are extremely inexpensive and plentiful.<br>
The fibers used in making the sheets and other articles of the present invention<br>
preferably have a high length to width ratio (or "aspect ratio") because longer, narrower<br>
fibers can impart more strength to the pclymer blend while adding significantly less bulk<br>
and mass to the matrix than thicker fibers. The fibers will have an aspect ratio of at least<br>
about 10:1, preferably greater than about 25:1, more preferably greater than about 50:1,<br>
and most preferably greater than about 100:1.<br>
The amount of fibers added to the polymer blends will vary depending upon the<br>
desired properties of the finished article of manufacture, with tensile strength, toughness,<br>
flexibility, and cost being the principle criteria for determining the amount of fiber to be<br>
added in any mix design. Accordingly, the concentration of fibers within the polymer<br>
blends of the present invention can be ncluded in a broad range from 0% to about 90%<br>
by weight of the polymer blend. If included at all, fibers will preferably be included in an<br><br>
amount in a range from about 1% to about 80% by weight of the polymer blend, more<br>
preferably in a range from about 3% to about 50% by weight, and most preferably in a<br>
range from about 5% to about 30% by weight of the polymer blend.<br>
c. Organic Fillers<br>
The polymer blends may also include a wide range of organic fillers. Depending<br>
on the melting points of the polymer blend and organic filler being added, the organic<br>
filler may remain as a discrete particle and constitute a solid phase separate from the<br>
thermoplastic phase, or it may partially or wholly melt and become partially or wholly<br>
associated with the thermoplastic phase.<br>
Organic fillers may cofnprise a wide variety of natural occurring organic fillers<br>
such as, for example, seagel, cork, seeds, gelatins, wood flour, saw dust, milled polymeric<br>
materials, agar-based materials, native starch granules, pregelatinized and dried starch,<br>
expandable particles, and the like. Organic fillers may also include one or more synthetic<br>
polymers of which there is vietually endless variety. Because of the diverse nature of<br>
organic fillers, there will not generally be a preferred concentration range for the optional<br>
organic filler component.<br>
Organic fillers can partially or wholly take the place of inorganic fillers. In some<br>
cases, organic fillers can be seslected that will impart the same properties as inorganic<br>
fillers, such as to increase dee d-fold, the: bulk hand feel, breathability and water vapor<br>
transmission. When included at all, the organic filler component will typically be<br>
included in an amount of at least about 5% by weight of the overall composition,<br>
preferably at least about 10% by weight, more preferably at least about 20% by weight,<br>
and more especially preferably at least a.bout 30% by weight, and most preferably at least<br>
about 35% by weight of the overall composition.<br>
3. Natural Polymers,<br>
In addition to thermoplastic starch or starch particles, other natural polymers that<br>
may be used within the polyner blends comprise or are derivatives of cellulose, other<br>
polysaccharides, polysaccharicle gums and proteins.<br>
Examples of starches and starch derivatives include, but are not limited to,<br>
modified starches, cationic ani anionic starches, and starch esters such as starch acetate,<br>
starch hydroxyethyl ether, alkyl starches, dextrins, amine starches, phosphates starches,<br>
and dialdehyde starches.<br>
Examples of derivatives of cellulose include, but are not limited to, cellulosic<br>
esters (e.g., cellulose formate, cellulose acetate, cellulose diacetate, cellulose propionate,<br><br>
cellulose butyrate, cellulose valerate, mixed esters, and mixtures thereof) and ceilulosic<br>
ethers (e.g.', methylhydroxyethy cellulose, hydroxymethylethylcellulose, carboxymethyl-<br>
cellulose, methylcellulose, ethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxyethylpropyl-<br>
cellulose, and mixtures thereof).<br>
Other polysaccharide-based polymers that can be incorporated into the polymer<br>
blends of the invention include alginic acid, alginates, phycocolloids, agar, gum arabic,<br>
guar gum, acacia gum, carragsenan gum, furcellaran gum, ghatti gum, psyllium gum,<br>
quince gum, tamarind gum, locust bean gum, gum karaya, xanthan gum, and gum<br>
tragacanth, and mixtures or derivatives thereof.<br>
Suitable protein-based polymers include, for example, Zein® (a prolamine derived<br>
from com), collagen (extracted from animal connective tissue and bones) and derivatives<br>
thereof such as gelatin and glue, casein (the principle protein in cow milk), sunflower<br>
protein, egg protein, soybean protein, vegetable gelatins, gluten and mixtures or<br>
derivatives thereof.<br>
4. Non Biodegradable Polymers.<br>
Although polymer blends preferably include biodegradable polymers, it is<br>
certainly within the scope of the invention to include one or more polymers which are not<br>
biodegradable. If the nonbioc egradable polymer generally comprises a disperse phase<br>
rather than the dominant continuous phase, polymer blends that include a<br>
nonbiodegradable polymer will nevertheless be biodegradable, at least in part. When<br>
degraded, the polymer blend may leave behind a nonbiodegradable residue that<br>
nevertheless is superior to the waste left behind by sheets and films that are entirely made<br>
of nonbiodegradable polymers.<br>
Examples of common nonbiodegradable polymers suitable for forming sheets and<br>
films include, but are not Unrated to, polyethylene, polypropylene, polybutylene, PET,<br>
PETG, PETE, polyvinyl chloride, PVDC, polystyrene, polyamides, nylon,<br>
polycarbonates, polysulfides, polysulfones, copolymers including one or more of the<br>
foregoing, and the like.<br>
D. Polymer Blends.<br>
1. Concenpration Ranges of Biodegradable Polymers.<br>
The concentrations of the various components within the polymer blends used to<br>
treat fibrous sheets will depend on a number of factors, including the desired physical and<br>
mechanical properties of the treated sheet, the performance criteria of articles to be<br><br>
manufactured from a treated sheet, the processing equipment used to manufacture and<br>
convert the blends and treated sheets into the desired article of manufacture, and the<br>
particular components within the blends. One of ordinary skill in the art will be able, in<br>
light of the specific examples and other teachings disclosed herein, to select and optimize<br>
the concentrations of the various components through routine testing.<br>
In view of the wide variety of polymer blends within the scope of the invention, as<br>
well as the wide variety of different properties that may be engineered within the blends,<br>
the hard and soft polymers may be included within widely varying concentration ranges.<br>
In those cases where the polymer blend or composition includes a blend of stiff and soft<br>
biodegradable polymers, the one or more stiff biodegradable polymers within the<br>
inventive blends may have a c oncentration in a range from about 20% to about 99% by<br>
weight of the biodegradable polymers exclusive of the fibrous sheet and any fillers,<br>
preferably a concentration of at least about 30% by weight of the polymer blend, more<br>
preferably at least about 40% by weight of the polymer blend, more especially preferably<br>
greater than, but not including 50% by weight of the polymer blend, and most preferably<br>
at least about 55% by weight of the polymer blend.<br>
Similarly, when a blend of stiff and soft polymers is employed, the soft polymers<br>
may have a concentration in a range from about 1% to about 80% by weight of the<br>
biodegradable polymers exclusive of the fibrous sheet and any fillers, preferably a<br>
concentration up to about 70 % by weight of the polymer blend, more preferably up to<br>
about 60% by weight of the polymer blend, more especially preferably less than, but not<br>
including, 50% by weight of he polymer blend, and most preferably up to about 45% by<br>
weight of the polymer blend.<br>
The foregoing concernrations are measured in terms of the blend of hard and soft<br>
polymers exclusive of any optional components that may be added, as described and<br>
identified above.<br>
2. Properties of Polymer Blends and Treated Sheets.<br>
The polymer blends may be engineered to have a variety of desired properties as<br>
described herein. The properties of the final treated fibrous sheet will depend on a<br>
number of factors, including mix design of the polymer blend, processing conditions,<br>
post-formation processing, poduct size,, particularly thickness, and the like. In the case<br>
of treated sheets intended to be used as "wraps", such as wraps used to enclose meats,<br>
other perishable food items, and especially fast food items (e.g., sandwiches, burgers and<br>
dessert items), it will generally be desirable to provide treated sheets having good "dead-<br><br>
fold" properties so that once folied, wrapped or otherwise manipulated into a desired<br>
orientation, such wraps will tend to maintain their orientation so as to not spontaneously<br>
unfold or unwrap, as which occurs with a large number of plastic sheets and films (e.g.,<br>
polyethylene).<br>
In order to improve the dead-fold properties of treated sheets biodegradable<br>
polymers may be selected which yield blends having a relatively high Young's modulus,<br>
preferably at least about 100 MPa, more preferably at least about 150 MPa, and most<br>
preferably at least about 200 MPa. In general, increasing the concentration of the stiff<br>
biodegradable polymer will tend to increase the Young's modulus. The Young's<br>
modulus may also be increased by loading the polymer blends with one or more fillers,<br>
such as particulate or fibrous fillers, as described above.<br>
In addition to, or instead of, increasing the Young's modulus to improve dead-<br>
fold, the treated sheets may be optionally processed to increase the "bulk hand feel" of a<br>
sheet, which is done by disrupt ng the generally planar nature of the sheet. This can be<br>
done, for example, by embossing, crimping, quilting or otherwise texturing the sheet so as<br>
to have regularly spaced-apart or random hills and valleys rather than simply a smooth,<br>
planar sheet. This may be done, for exsimple, by passing the sheet through a pair of<br>
knurled or other embossing-type rollers. Such texturing increases the ability of a sheet to<br>
take and maintain a fold, crinkle, creases; or other bend, thus improving the dead-fold<br>
properties of the sheet.<br>
Another way to increase the surface area of the treated sheets according to the<br>
invention so as to increase their bulk hand feel aod/or dead-fold is to include particulate<br>
fillers in which at least a porticn of the particles have a particle size diameter that equals<br>
or exceeds the thickness of the polymer coating. In this way, treated sheets can be<br>
manufactured that have dead-fold approaching or equaling 100%, which exceeds the<br>
dead-fold properties of virtually all conventional paper or plastic wraps and sheets<br>
currently on the market. An example of a conventional sheet or wrap having 100% dead-<br>
fold is aluminum or other meta i foils.<br>
Other properties that may be desirable when manufacturing food wraps are beat<br>
resistance, microwaveability, ;nd insulation ability. Increasing the amount of inorganic<br>
filler within the polymer blend or composition used to coat or impregnate a fibrous sheet<br>
tends to increase the heat resistance, microwaveability, and insulation ability of the<br>
treated fibrous sheets. It has teen found, for example, that a soft biodegradabJe polymer<br>
can be blended with an inorganic filler, such as ground or precipitated silica, to yield<br><br>
abiodegradable polymer composition that includes at least about 30% by weight of the<br>
inorganic filler. Adding at least about 30% by weight inorganic filler to a soft<br>
biodegradable polymer yields a treated fibrous sheet that does not break down when<br>
placed in a microwave oven.<br>
The use of fillers, coupled with specific processing techniques, can also be used to<br>
create "cavitation". Cavitatior. occurs as the thermoplastic polymer fraction is pulled in<br>
either a monoaxial or biaxial direction and the filler particles create a discontinuity in the<br>
film or sheet that increases in size during stretching. During stretching, a portion of the<br>
stretched polymer pulls away from the filler particles, resulting in tiny cavities in the<br>
vicinity of the filler particles. This, in turn, results in greatly increased breathabiliry and<br>
vapor transmission of the sheets and fibms. It also results in films or sheets having a<br>
touch and feel that much more closely resembles the touch and feel of paper, as<br>
contrasted with conventional plastic sheets and films. The result is a sheet, film or wrap<br>
that can be used for applications that are presently performed or satisfied using paper<br>
products (i.e., wraps, tissues, printed materials, etc.)<br>
Treated sheets accordirg to the invention can have any desired thickness. Treated<br>
sheets suitable for wrapping, inclosing or otherwise covering food items or other solid<br>
substrates will typically have a measured thickness between about 0.0003" and about<br>
0.01" (about 7.5-250 microns , and a calculated thickness between about 0.00015" and<br>
about 0.005" (about 4-125 mic-ons).<br>
The measured thickness will typically be between 10-100% larger than the<br>
calculated thickness when the sheets and films are made from compositions that have a<br>
relatively high concentration of particulate filler particles, which can protrude from the<br>
surface of the treated sheet. This phenomenon is especially pronounced when significant<br>
quantities of filler particles having a particle size diameter that is larger than the thickness<br>
of the polymer matrix are used.<br>
Treated sheets suitable for use as wraps will preferably have a measured thickness<br>
in a range from about 0.0004' to about 0.005" (about 10 to about 125 microns), more<br>
preferably in a range from about 0.0005" to about 0.003" (about 12 to about 75 microns),<br>
and most preferably in a range from about 0.001" to about 0.002" (about 25 to about 50<br>
microns). On the other hand, ireated sheets suitable for use as wraps will preferably have<br>
a calculated thickness in a range from about 0.0002" to about 0.003" (about 5 to about 75<br>
microns), more preferably in a range from about 0.0003" to about 0.002" (about 7.5 to<br><br>
about 50 microns), and most preferably in a range from about 0.0005" to about 0.0015"<br>
(about 12 to about 40 microns),<br>
The difference betweet the calculated and measured thickness tends to increase<br>
with increasing filler content and also with increasing particle size. Conversely, the<br>
difference between the calculated and measured thickness tends to decrease with<br>
decreasing filler content and also with decreasing particle size. Treated sheets that<br>
include no fillers, or lower quantities of fillers having a particle size diameter that is<br>
substantially lower than the thickness of the polymer matrix, will have a measured<br>
thickness that is similar or equal to the calculated thickness.<br>
Another important property of the biodegradable blends is that when such blends<br>
are used to coat or impregnate fibrous sheets, the treated sheets are readily printable<br>
without further processing. 1 hus, another advantage of utilizing the inventive polymer<br>
blends in the manufacture of wraps is that such blends are generally able to accept and<br>
retain print much more easily than conventional plastics or waxed papers. Many plastics<br>
and waxes are highly hydropliobic and must be surface oxidized in order to provide a<br>
chemically receptive surfacero which ink can adhere. Biodegradable polymers, on the<br>
other hand, typically include oxygen-containing moieties, such as ester or amide groups,<br>
to which inks can readily adhe re.<br>
3. Measuring Dead-Fold<br>
The term "dead-fold" refers to the tendency of a sheet to maintain a crease,<br>
crinkle, fold or other bend. The dead-fold properties of a sheet can be accurately<br>
measured using a standard tesi known in the art. This test provides the ability to compare<br>
and contrast the dead-fold properties of various sheets. The following equipment is<br>
useful in performing the standard dead-fold test: (1) a semicircular protractor, divided<br>
along a 1" diameter semicircle; (2) a weight consisting of a smooth-faced metal block that<br>
is 0.75" ± 0.05" by 1.25" ± 0.05" and of such a thickness so as to weigh 50 g± 0.05 g; (3)<br>
a 1" x 4" template for cutting test specimens; (4) a timer or stopwatch capable of timing to<br>
1 second; (5) a utility knife or other cutting tool; and (6) a humidity chamber.<br>
The first step is preparation of an appropriately sized sample. In the case where a<br>
sheet has different properties in the machine direction compared to the cross-machine<br>
direction it may be useful to measure and average the dead-fold properties in both<br>
directions. The standard sample specimen is a 1" x 4" strip of the sheet to be tested.<br><br>
The second step is a conditioning step in order to ensure uniformity of test<br>
conditions. The specimens are conditioned by placing them in a humidity chamber at 23<br>
C and 50% relative humidity fir a minimum of 24 hours.<br>
The third step is the actual dead-fold test of each conditioned test strip. The<br>
specimen is removed from the 1aumidity chamber and its weight recorded. A light mark is<br>
made 1" from one end of the test strip. The test strip is then placed on a flat surface and<br>
bent over at the mark but without creasing the strip. Next, the weight is placed squarely<br>
and gently over the bend with two thirds (or 0.5") of the weight overlapping the specimen<br>
so that a crease is formed, and with one third or (0.25") of the weight overhanging the<br>
crease. The edges of the weight parallel to the strip should project evenly (about 0.125")<br>
beyond each side of the strip. The weight is allowed to rest on the specimen for 10<br>
seconds. Then it is removed. After exactly 30 seconds, the angle formed by the crease is<br>
measured.<br>
The foregoing process i s repeated using the other side of the strip and using as<br>
many additional strips as will give a statistically accurate measure of the dead-fold<br>
properties of a given sheet or film. The average angle A is then input into the following<br>
formula to determine the percenrage dead-fold C for a given sample:<br>
C = 100*(180-A)/180<br>
If the angle A is 0° (i.e. where the crease is maintained so that no spring back is<br>
observed), the sample has 100% dead-fold (C = 100*(180-0)/180 = 100%). At the other<br>
extreme, if the angle A is 180° (i.e., where the sample springs all the way back so that the<br>
sample is essentially flat, the simple has 0% dead-fold (C = 100*(180-180)/180 = 0%).<br>
In the middle, a sample that sp: ings back half way so as to form a right angle has 50%<br>
dead-fold (C = 100*(180-90)/18) = 50%).<br>
When used to wrap foods, or whenever good dead-fold properties are desired,<br>
treated sheets according to the vention can be manufactured so as to have a dead-fold of<br>
at least about 50%. Preferably, reated sheets will have a dead-fold of at least about 60%,<br>
more preferably at least about 20%, more especially preferably at least about 80%, and<br>
most preferably at least about 90%. Treated sheets according to the invention have been<br>
developed that have a dead-fold approaching or equal to 100%. By way of comparison,<br>
sheets and films made from polyethylene (e.g., for use in making sandwich or garbage<br>
bags) typically have a dead-fold of 0%. Standard paper wraps commonly used in the fast<br>
food industry typically have a dead-fold between about 40-80%. Thus, treated sheets<br>
according to the invention can be manufactured so as to have dead-fold properties that<br><br>
meet or exceed those of standard paper wraps, and which are many times greater than<br>
conventional plastic films and sheets, often orders of magnitude greater.<br>
III. METHODS OF MANUFACTURING POLYMER BLENDS AND FIBROUS<br>
SHEETS<br>
It is within the scope of the invention to employ any manufacturing apparatus<br>
known in the art of manufacturing thermoplastic compositions to form the polymer and<br>
any coating apparatus to coat or impregnate fibrous sheets with the polymer blends.<br>
Examples of suitable mixing apparatus that can be used to form polymer blends according<br>
include a twin-shafted kneader with meshing screws having kneading blocks sold by the<br>
Buss Company, a BRABENDER mixer, a THEYSOHN TSK 045 compounder, which is<br>
a twin-shaft extruder with shafts rotating in the same direction and which has multiple<br>
heating and processing zones, a BUSS KO Kneader having a heatable auger screw, a<br>
BAKER-PERKINS MPC/V-30 double and single auger extruder, single or twin auger<br>
OMC extruders, a Model EPV 60/56D extruder, a BATTAGGION ME100 direct-current<br>
slow mixer, a HAAKE Reomex extruder, a COLLIN Blown Film Extruder, a<br>
BATTENFELD-GLOUCESTER Blown Film Extruder, and a BLACK-CLAWSON Cast<br>
Film Extruder.<br>
Many of the foregoing mixers are also extruders, which makes them suitable for<br>
extruding films or sheets from the polymer blends, which can then be laminated together<br>
with a fibrous sheet. Alternativey, polymer blends can be made using transfer-line-<br>
injection technology where resin manufacturers can inject the various minor components<br>
of these blends into the main poly components during manufacture. One of ordinary skill<br>
in the art will be able to select and optimize an appropriate manufacturing apparatus<br>
according to the desired article to be manufactured. Once a thermoplastic melt has been<br>
formed using any of the above-mentioned mixers, or any other appropriate mixing and<br>
melting apparatus known in the thermoplastic art, virtually any molding, extrusion,<br>
shaping or coating apparatus known in the thermoplastic molding or processing art can be<br>
used to produce finished articles of manufacture comprising fibrous sheets that have been<br>
coated or impregnated with a polymer blend to render the sheets more resistant to<br>
penetration by liquids.<br>
In a preferred embodiment for manufacturing sheets and films from the polymer<br>
blends, which can then be laminated together with fibrous sheets, the sheets and films can<br>
be manufactured using a compounding twin screw extruder to prepare the blends, and a<br>
blown film or cast film line to make he films and sheets. Blown films and sheets tend to<br><br>
have similar, if not identical, styrength and other performance properties in the biaxial<br>
direction due to how they are processed (i.e., they are extruded as a tube and then<br>
expanded in all directions by bl<br>
owing air within the confines of the tube, causing it to<br>
expand like a balloon). Cast films or sheet:;, on the other hand, unless subjected to biaxial<br>
stretching, will be substantially stronger (e.g. will have substantially greater tensile<br>
strength) in the machine direction and will be substantially more tear resistant in the<br>
cross-machine direction. When extruding a thermoplastic material, the polymer<br>
molecules tend to be oriented in the machine direction. Machine direction orientation is<br>
further increased if the extruded sheet or film is passed through a nip to decrease the sheet<br>
or film thickness in the machine direction.<br>
The treated sheets according to the invention may be coated or impregnated on<br>
one or both sides as desired. The / may be formed by laminating a fibrous sheet with one<br>
or more sheets or films, co-extruding a sheet or film of a polymer blend with a fibrous<br>
sheet, dipping, spreading (e.g., using a doctor blade), spraying, and the like. Because a<br>
portion of the treated sheets are thermoplastic, the sheets can be post-treated by heat<br>
sealing to join two ends together to form sacks, pockets, pouches, and the like. They can<br>
be laminated onto existing sheets or substrates.<br>
Monoaxial or biaxial stretching of slieets and films used to coat a surface of a<br>
fibrous sheet can be used to create cavitation. To create cavitation, a particulate filler is<br>
included that yields discontinuities as the sheet or film is stretched while still in a<br>
thermoplastic condition. Cavitation increases: the breathability and vapor transmission of<br>
the sheets and films. It also results in films or sheets having a touch and feel that much<br>
more closely resembles the touch and feel of paper compared to conventional<br>
thermoplastic sheets and films.<br>
When employing certain coating or impregnating techniques, such as spreading or<br>
spraying a biodegradable polymer composition onto a fibrous sheet, it may be<br>
advantageous to increase the MFI of the molten polymer composition. This allows the<br>
molten polymer composition to flow more readily so as to coat or impregnate the fibrous<br>
sheet. Preferably, the molten polyrner composition has an MFI of at least about 40 g/10<br>
min., more preferably at least about 70 g/10 min., and most preferably at least about 100<br>
g/10min.<br>
As discussed above, the MFI can, depending on the biodegradable polymer or<br>
polymer blend, be increased to a desired level by heating it to a higher temperature. In<br>
some cases, however, heating a polymer to temperature that might theoretically decrease<br><br>
the MFI to an acceptable level might, instead, scorch, burn or otherwise damage the<br>
polymer composition. In such cases it may be desirable to add a plasticizer to the<br>
polymer composition. The plast icizer might be a volatile or non-volatile plasticizer, as<br>
discussed above.<br>
According to one embodiment, water is added to increase the MFI of the molten<br>
polymer composition. Adding 2(0 ppm water to a polymer composition has been found<br>
to increase the MFI from 4 g/10 min. to 40 g/10 min. Based on this, one of ordinary skill<br>
can adjust the water concentration as desired to raise or lower the MFI to a predetermined<br>
level.<br>
In the case of a spray coating method, one or more volatile solvents, such as<br>
alcohols, ketones, or chlorinated hydrocarbons, can be used to raise the MFI of the molten<br>
polymer composition. During or a fter the coating process, as the volatile solvent is driven<br>
off by evaporation, the solvent is a dvantageously recovered and reused for both economic<br>
and environmental reasons.<br>
IV. EXAMPLES<br>
The following examples are presented in order to more specifically teach<br>
compositions and process conditio is for forming biodegradable polymer blends, as well<br>
as treated fibrous sheets therefrom. The examples include various mix designs of the<br>
inventive biodegradable polymer blends as well various processes for manufacturing the<br>
blends and then forming polymeric sheets and films therefrom.<br>
EXAMPLES 1-3<br>
Biodegradable polymer films were manufactured from biodegradable polymer<br>
blends having the following mix designs, with the concentrations being expressed in<br>
terms of weight percent of the entire polymer blend:<br><br>
The foregoing polymer bleids were blended and blown into films at Gemini<br>
Plastics, located in Maywood, California, using DuPont supplied BIOMAX 6926 (both<br>
new and old lots), a silica master bach in BIOMAX 6926 base resin supplied by DuPont,<br>
and ECOFLEX-F resin obtained fro: n BASF. The films were blown using a Gemini film<br>
blowing extruder (L/D 24/1) equipped with a 2 inch barrier mixing screw containing a<br><br>
Maddock shear mixing tip, and a 4 inch diameter annular die with a die gap of 0.032-<br>
0.035".<br>
Even though a typical quantity of silica antiblock was used (i.e., 0.16%),<br>
significant blocking of the film was obseived for the film made using the mix design of<br>
Example 3 (i.e. 20% ECOFLEX); however, there was no observed blocking of the 5 and<br>
10% ECOFLEX blends of Examples 1 and 2. For purposes of comparison, films of neat<br>
ECOFLEX and BIOMAX were manufactured. The neat ECOFLEX films were<br>
manufactured using BASF ECOI LEX-F resin and a 30% talc master batch in the same<br>
resin. The neat BIOMAX film: (new and old) included 0.16% SiO2, while the neat<br>
ECOFLEX films included 4 5% talc;. The mechanical properties of the<br>
BIOMAX/ECOFLEX blend films and the control BIOMAX and neat ECOFLEX-F films<br>
were measured under ambient conditions. The data generated is show graphically in<br>
Charts 1-8 depicted in Figures 1-8. respectively.<br>
Chart 1, depicted in Figure 1, is a plot of the strain rate versus percent elongation<br>
at break for the various films tested. At 500 mm/min. strain rate, both new and old<br>
BIOMAX films displayed poor elongation. The neat ECOFLEX films and all of the films<br>
made from the BIOMAX-ECOFLEX blends had significantly better elongations than the<br>
neat BIOMAX films at all of the strain rates studied. On the other hand, the 20%<br>
ECOFLEX blend of Example 3 exhibited equal or better elongation compared to the neat<br>
ECOFLEX films at lower strain rates, ever though these films included nearly 80%<br>
BIOMAX, which was shown to have very poor elongation.<br>
Chart 2, depicted in Figure 2, is a plot of percent elongation versus percentage of<br>
ECOFLEX in the BIOMAX/ECO]'LEX blends measured at a fixed strain rate of 500<br>
mm/min. As represented by Chat 2, there was a nearly linear improvement in the<br>
percent elongation as the concentration of ECOFLEX was increased. Moreover, the 20%<br>
ECOFLEX blend of Example 3 had an elongation as good as the neat ECOFLEX films.<br>
Chart 3, depicted in Figure 3, similarly plots the percent elongation versus the<br>
percentage of ECOFLEX in the BIOMAX/ECOFLEX blends measured at a fixed strain<br>
rate of 1000 mm/min. Again, a dramatic improvement in the elongation of the<br>
BIOMAX/ECOFLEX blend was seen as the concentration of ECOFLEX reached 10 and<br>
20%, respectively, although the tren 1 was not as clear as the data in Chart 2, measured at<br>
a fixed strain rate of 500 mm/min.<br>
Chart 4, depicted in Figure 4, is a plot of the strain rate versus break stress of the<br>
various films. Again, neat ECOFLEX and all of the BIOMAX/ECOFLEX blends had<br><br>
significantly better break stress than the neat BIOMAX films at all of the strain rates<br>
studied. Moreover, the BIOMAK/ECOFLEX blends had significantly better break stress<br>
than the neat ECOFLEX films at all strain rates, thus showing that the<br>
BIOMAX/ECOFLEX blends are all stronger in tensile strength than either of neat<br>
BIOMAX or ECOFLEX.<br>
Chart 5, depicted in Figure 5, is a plot of the break stress versus percent<br>
ECOFLEX in the BIOMAX/ECOFLEX blends of Examples 1-3 measured at a fixed<br>
strain rate of 500 mm/min. Once again, a. nearly linear increase in break stress was<br>
observed as the concentration of ECOFLEX was increased. Moreover, the 20% blend of<br>
Example 3 exhibited the surprising and unexpected result of having nearly twice the<br>
break stress as the neat ECOFLEX film, and nearly three times the break stress as the neat<br>
BIOMAX film.<br>
Chart 6, depicted in Figure 6, is a plot of the break stress versus percent<br>
ECOFLEX in the BIOMAX/ECC FLEX blends of Examples 1-3 measured at a fixed<br>
strain rate of 1000 mm/min. At this strain rate, the 10% ECOFLEX blend of Example 2<br>
had the highest break stress, with a maximum peak stress of 72 MPa.<br>
Charts 7 and 8, depicted in Figures 7 and 8, respectively, plot the water vapor<br>
permeability coefficient (WVPC) of the various films as a function of the concentration<br>
of ECOFLEX within the films. In Chart 7, the estimated trend line is based on a WVPC<br>
of 7.79 x 10"3 g cm/m2/d/mm Hg, which is the lowest measured WVPC for a neat<br>
ECOFLEX film. In Chart 8, the esimated trend line is alternatively based on a WVPC of<br>
42 x 10"3 g cm/m2/d/mm Hg, which is the highest measured WVPC for a neat ECOFLEX<br>
film. The data in Charts 7 and 8 irdicate that the water vapor barrier properties of the 5<br>
and 10% ECOFLEX blends of Examples 1 and 2 were essentially the same as that of the<br>
neat BIOMAX film. The WVPC data for all samples were measured by the standard<br>
procedures described in the Test Method ASTM F 1249-90.<br>
Chart 9, depicted in Figure 9, is a plot of the modulus of various films as a<br>
function of the concentration of ECOFLEX within the films. Surprisingly, the modulus<br>
of blends containing BIOMAX ard ECOFLEX are significantly higher than of neat<br>
BIOMAX and ECOFLEX. Becaust one of the uses of the films manufactured according<br>
to the present invention is as a wrab having good dead-fold properties, and because the<br>
degree of dead-fold is believed to be related to the modulus of a film, blends of BIOMAX<br>
and ECOFLEX appear to have superior dead-fold properties over each of the neat<br><br>
BIOMAX and ECOFLEX films, with the 5% and 10% blends exhibiting the highest<br>
modulus.<br>
The foregoing films are used to laminate at least one side of a fibrous sheet, such<br>
as a tissue paper, more particularly a 12-15 lb/3000 ft2 tissue paper, to yield a treated<br>
sheet. The treated sheet can be used as a food packaging wrap that resists penetration by<br>
water and oils found in food.<br>
EXAMPLES 4-5<br>
Films were manufactured from biodegradable polymer blends having the<br>
following mix designs, with the concentrations being expressed in terms of weight<br>
. percent of the entire polymer blends:<br><br>
The films were blown usir.g a Gemini film blowing extruder (L/D 24/1) equipped<br>
with a 2 inch barrier mixing screw containing a Maddock shear mixing tip, and a 4 inch<br>
diameter annular die with a die g;.p of 0.032-0.035". The film of Example 5 had better<br>
dead-fold properties than the film of Example 4, which might be attributable to the higher<br>
concentration of talc within the blend used in Example 5.<br>
The foregoing films are used to laminate at least one side of a fibrous sheet, such<br>
as a tissue paper, more particulary a 12-15 lb/3000 ft2 tissue paper, to yield a treated<br>
sheet. The treated sheet can be used as a food packaging wrap that resist penetration by<br>
water and oils found in food.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
A film was manufactured from a biodegradable polymer blend having the<br>
following mix design, with the concentration being expressed in terms of weight percent<br>
of the entire polymer blend:<br>
ECOFLBX-F	20%<br>
Thermoplastic Starch	50%<br>
Polylactic Acid	15%<br>
Inorganic Filler	15%<br>
The Thermoplastic Starch was obtained from Biotec Biologische<br>
Natuverpackungen GmbH &amp; Co., KG ("Biotes"), located in Emmerich, Germany. The<br>
polylactic acid was obtained from Cargill-Dow Polymers, LLC, located in Midland,<br><br>
Michigan, USA. The inorganic filler was calcium carbonate obtained from OMYA,<br>
division Pluess-Staufer AG, located in Oftringen, Switzerland.<br>
The foregoing blend was manufactured and blown into films using a proprietary<br>
extrusion line thermoplastic statch extrusion/film blowing apparatus manufactured and<br>
assembled specifically for Biote<. in particular the extrusion blowing apparatus was></.>
manufactured by Dr. Collin GmbH, located in Ebersberg, Germany. A detailed<br>
description of an extrusion/film blowing apparatus similar to the one used by Biotec is set<br>
forth in U.S. Patent No. 5,525,281 to Lorcks et al. U.S. Patent No. 6,136,097 to Lorcks et<br>
al. discloses processes for manufacturing intermediate thermoplastic starch-containing<br>
granulates that can be further processed to make films and sheets. For purposes of<br>
disclosure, the foregoing patents are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The film had a modulus of 215.65 MPa. Thus, it had excellent dead-fold<br>
properties as a result of the inclus on of the inorganic filler and the polylactic acid, which<br>
is a generally stiff, crystalline polrmer at room temperature. As set forth above, PLA has<br>
a glass transition temperature between 50-60°C. The ECOFLEX and thermoplastic starch<br>
(TPS) both acted as soft, low glass transition temperature polymers. The TPS, when<br>
blended with additional polymers and at very low water, has a glass transition<br>
temperature approaching -60°C. The ECOFLEX and TPS thus assisted the blowability<br>
and flexibility of the blend. The TPS also increased the natural polymer content, thus<br>
making the film more biodegradable.<br>
The foregoing film is used :o laminate: at least one side of a fibrous sheet, such as<br>
a tissue paper, more particularly a 12-15 lb/3000 ft2 tissue paper, to yield a treated sheet.<br>
The treated sheet can be used as a food packaging wrap that resists penetration by water<br>
and oils found in food.<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
A film was manufactured from a biodegradable polymer blend having the<br>
following mix design, with the concentration being expressed in terms of weight percent<br>
of the entire polymer blend:<br>
Thermoplastic Starcl	30%<br>
BAK1095	60%<br>
Inorganic Filler	10%<br>
The thermoplastic starch wa,; obtained from Biotec. The BAK 1095 was obtained<br>
from Bayer AG, located in Köln, Germany, and was an aliphatic-aromatic<br><br>
polyesteramide. The inorganic filler was calcium carbonate obtained from OMYA,<br>
division Piuess-Staufer AG, loc ated in Oftringen, Switzerland.<br>
The foregoing blend was manufactured and blown into films using the proprietary<br>
thermoplastic starch extrusion/1 Urn blowing apparatus described in Example 6. The film<br>
had excellent dead-fold propert.es as a result of the inclusion of the inorganic filler and<br>
the BAK 1095, which is a some what stiff, crystalline polymer at room temperature even<br>
though it is classified as "film gade". As set forth above, BAK 1095 behaves as if it has<br>
a glass transition temperature of at least .10°C. Because the glass transition temperature<br>
of BAK 1095 is relatively low compared to PLA, considerably more BAK could be<br>
included without destroying the film-blow;ing properties and flexibility of the resulting<br>
film. The TPS acted as the soft, low glass transition temperature polymer, and further<br>
assisted the blowability and flexibility of the blend. It also increased the natural polymer<br>
content, thus making the film more biodegradable.<br>
The foregoing film is usec to laminate at least one side of a fibrous sheet, such as<br>
a tissue paper, more particularly a 12-15 lb/3000 ft2 tissue paper, to yield a treated sheet.<br>
The treated sheet can be used as a food packaging wrap that resists penetration by water<br>
and oils found in food.<br>
EXAMPLES 8-12<br>
Films were manufactureo from biodegradable polymer blends having the<br>
following mix designs, with the coocentrations being expressed in term of weight percent<br>
of the entire polymer blend:<br><br>
The tale was supplied by luzenac, located in Englewood, Colorado, having a<br>
particle size of 3.8 microns. The titanium dioxide was supplied by Kerr-McGee<br>
Chemical, LLC, located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, grade TRONOX 470, having a<br>
particle size of 0.17 micron. The calcium carbonate was supplied by Omnia, located in<br>
Lucerne Valley, California, particle size of 2 microns. The foregoing blends were<br><br>
manufactured on a Werner Pfeiderer ZSK twin-screw extruder, and blown into sheets<br>
using a Gemini film blowing extruder (L/D 24/1) equipped with a 2 inch barrier mixing<br>
screw containing a Maddock shear mixing tip, and a 4 inch diameter die. All of the films<br>
had excellent dead-fold properties. The polymer blends of Examples 10-12 were also<br>
extruded into sheets using a sing.e screw extruder and a 14 inch flat cast-film die, and the<br>
usual nip-rolls and film take-up assembly normal to such a system. All of these films also<br>
had excellent dead-fold properties.<br>
The foregoing films are used to laminate at least one side of a fibrous sheet, such<br>
as a tissue paper, more particularly a 12-15 lb/3000 ft2 tissue paper, to yield a treated<br>
sheet. The treated sheet can be used as a food packaging wrap that resists penetration by<br>
water and oils found in food.<br>
Examples 13-61<br>
Blown and cast films and sheets were manufactured from biodegradable polymer<br>
blends having the following mix designs, with the concentrations being expressed in term<br>
of weight percent of the entire polymer blend:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
92%, 92%, 91%, 100%, 100%, 100%, 100% and 100%, respectively. Although films<br>
made from the other compositiors were net tested for dead-fold, they would be expected<br>
to have relatively high dead-fold compared to conventional biopolymers (i.e., at least<br>
about 80%). The water vapor transmission rate for films made using the compositions of<br>
Examples 36, 38, 41 and 43 were 91.94, 9132, 98.29 and 80.31 g/m2/day, respectively.<br>
The composition of Example 60 was processed and blown into a film using a<br>
BATTENFELD-GLOUCESTER Blown Film Extruder. A film made from this<br>
composition was found to have a vater vapor transmission rate of 42.48 g/m2/day.<br>
The composition of Examp e 61 was processed and blown into various films using<br>
both a BATTENFELD-GLOUCESTER Blown Film Extruder and a BLACK-CLAWSON<br>
Cast Film Extruder. The film formed using the BATTENFELD-GLOUCESTER Blown<br>
Film Extruder apparatus was tested and found to have a dead-fold of 100%. Two<br>
different thicknesses of films were formed using the BLACK-CLAWSON Cast Film<br>
Extruder, one having a thickness of 1.3 mils (0.0013") and another having a thickness of<br>
1.8 mils (0.0018"). Both had a distinctive machine direction orientation because they<br>
were cast, rather than blown, films. The 1.3 mil film had a dead-fold of 99%, and the 1.8<br>
mil film had adead-foldof 100%.<br>
The foregoing films and sheets are used to laminate at least one side of a fibrous<br>
sheet, such as a tissue paper, more particularly a 12-15 lb/3000 ft2 tissue paper, to yield a<br>
treated film or sheet. The treated film or sheet can be used as a food packaging wrap that<br>
resists penetration by water and oils found in food.<br>
EXAMPLE 62<br>
Any of the foregoing biodegradable polymer blends is used to coat or impregnate<br>
at least one side of a fibrous sheet. The polymer blend is heated, mixed or otherwise<br>
processed into a thermoplastic melt and then spread over a surface of a fibrous sheet<br>
using a doctor blade.   The fibrous  sheet is moved while the doctor blade remains<br>
stationary. Alternatively, the polymer blend is sprayed onto the fibrous sheet using spray-<br>
coating techniques known in the art.<br>
EXAMPLE 63<br>
Any of the foregoing b, odegradable polymer blends is modified by adding silica<br>
or replacing some or all of the calcium carbonate with silica. The modified composition<br>
is used to coat or impregnate at least one side of a fibrous sheet. The polymer blend is<br>
heated, mixed or otherwise processed into a thermoplastic melt and then spread over a<br>
surface of a fibrous sheet usin£ a doctor blade. The fibrous sheet is moved while the<br>
doctor blade remains stationary Alternatively, the polymer blend is sprayed onto the<br>
fibrous sheet using spray-coating techniques known in the art.<br>
Any of the foregoing compositions is modified by removing at least a portion of<br>
the particulate filler and then usiag the modified biodegradable composition to coat one<br>
or both sides of a fibrous sheet.<br>
