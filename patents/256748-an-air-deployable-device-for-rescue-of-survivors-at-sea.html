				<td>FIELD QF INVENTION<br>
This  invention  relates to a  rescue  device which  is  deployed  from an aircraft to  save  life  of survivors at sea. PRIOR flRT<br>
One of the mode of operation adopted for rescue of servivors at sea is either by sending ships or helicopters to spot of accident. The survivors are picked up by ships or a dinghy is thrown over board helicopter for rescue of them.<br>
Another mode of operation adopted for  rescue<br>
of  survivors at sea is that the helicopter locates  the<br>
survivors  and  gives information to shore  station  for<br>
taking  appropriate  action for rescue of  survivors  at<br>
sea.  Following the information, life rafts are  dropped<br>
in the vicinity of the survivors.<br>
The  above mode of operation has  limitations that  the  time  taken by a ship to reach  the  spot  of accident  is too long and the survivors; may  lose  their lives by the time the help reaches them.<br>
Further  limitation of  existing  operational modes  is  that the helicopter with its slow  speed  can<br>
cover  a  short distance in comparison to a  fixed  wing aircraft and may not be much useful in emergencies.<br>
The  further disadvantage of the above  modes of operation is that the numbers of dinghies/life rafts which  are thrown by hand from helicopter, is  small  in number and they have a lower capacity and can  therefore be able to save only a few survivors at a time.<br>
Yet   another  disadvantage  of  ship   being utilized  for rescue operation is that ship can  not  be taken  nearer to the survivors because of fear of  their getting  dragged  in to propeller wake of the  ship  and getting killed instead of saving their life. OBJECTS QF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
The primary object of this invention is to propose an air-deployable device for rescue of survivors at sea..<br>
Another  object of the present  invention  is to  propose  an air-deployable device which  can  rescue survivors  at  sea  within  a  relatively  shorter  time thereby enabling saving of more lives.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is  to  propose an air-deployable device for  rescue  of survivors at sea which enables rescue of survivors  over short range as well as at longer range.<br>
Yet another object of present invention is to<br>
propose an air deployable rescue device  which can  drop dinghy/life  raft very close to the survivors, such   as<br>
in  the  vicinity of 200 meters from them, so  that  the survivors can reach to the device immediately as soon as<br>
it  is sighted by them thus increasing their chances  of survival.<br>
Further object of the present invention is to<br>
propose  an  air--deployable rescue device  that  can  be deployed  from  a  height such as between   300  to  500<br>
meters  which is most convenient to the  pilot,  thereby avoiding the need for the aircraft to foe brought to  low<br>
altitude  which  is  dangerous  especially  due  to  bad visibility at close proximity to sea surface.<br>
Yet  further object of this invention  is  to propose  an  air-deployaxble rescue  device that  can  be<br>
deployed even when an aircraft is moving with high speed between  300 to 400 km/h thereby enabling the  pilot  of<br>
the aircraft to release the device without slowing  down as  soon  as marooned sailors are  sighted,  the  device<br>
being  capable of withstanding shock and  vibrations  of aircraft at such a speed.<br>
Further object of the present invention is to propose an air-deployable device for rescue of survivors at  sea which has a fast descent  rate due to which  the device reaches the sea-surface within a short period.<br>
Still further object of the present invention is to propose an air-deplayable device for rescue of survivors at sea which after release from the aircraft, on-impact with sea-surface, ejects out the dinghy out of shell and dinghy out of shell and dinghy or raft gets inflated within a very short time thereby enabling with a short period, the availability of the raft to the survivors who can climb into it and save their lives.<br>
Yet  further object  of this invention is  to<br>
propose  a  device which can  rescue  relatively  larger<br>
number of survivors in a single instance as the sise  of<br>
the device is so designed to adopt a dinghy/life raft of<br>
larger size which has a large carrying capacity.<br>
Still further object of the present invention is to propose a device which is totally safe for deployment from an aircraft as it incorporates a parachute system with cartridge cutters which ensures that device is safely brought to water surface with adequate speed, at the same time avoiding damage to the device.<br>
Still further object of this invention is to propose a device in which the dinghy on inflatation does not get dragged rapidly because of shell remaining attached to it which acts as an anchor.<br>
Further object of the present invention is to<br>
propose   a  device of such a design that  a  number  of<br>
these  devices can be deployed from an aircraft  in  the<br>
same   sorty,  thus  saving lives  of  large  number  of<br>
survivors at a time.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Referring to Fig 01, the device comprises of five major assemblies namely Shell Assembly (1), Impact Sensor Assembly (2), Lock Release Mechanism (3), Dinghy / Life Raft 
Referring to Fig 02 the Shell Assembly (1) (Fig 1) is made of Aluminium Sheet designed to house all the major assemblies mentioned above. The Shell Assembly consists of four main parts, Nose Cone (6), Centre Body (7), Tail Body (8) and Rail Assembly (9). Nose Cone (6) houses Impact Sensor Assembly (2) and Lock Release Mechanism (3). The body is divided into two compartments. The front compartment viz Dinghy compartment has openable doors (10) with locking arrangements. A bracket (11) is provided in this compartment to fix C02 cylinder, of Dinghy, firmly. A dinghy (4) is placed in this compartment. A Parachute with Cutters (5) is housed in Tail Compartment. The shell assembly (1) is provided with two Lugs (12) to load the device on the aircraft.<br>
Referring  to fig. 3, impact sensor  assembly<br>
(2)	is designed  to operate lock release mechanism  (3)<br>
on   impact   with  water.    According   to   preferred<br>
embodiment, the assembly has 10mm thick plate (.13) which on impact transfers the impact energy to the main  shaft<br>
(14).  The main shaft is held in position by balls  (15) with  radial springs (16).  As and when impact force  is<br>
felt  on  impact  plate  (13),  the  main  spring   (17) compresses  there-by releasing balls from  the  grooves.<br>
The  main  shaft (14) is forced to move  rearward.   The rearward movement is converted by cam (18) to move  bell<br>
crank  with roller (19) (fig.4) which is a part of  lock release   mechanism,  to  activate  the   lock   release<br>
mechanism.<br>
Referring  to fig. 4, lock release  mechanism<br>
(3)	(fig.l),  consists of two concentric  springs  (20)<br>
which are held in compressed condition by a plate  (21).<br>
The  plate is held in position by a lever (22) which  is<br>
connected  through  ball crank with  roller  (19).   The<br>
roller  rests  on  the cam (18)  of  the  impact  sensor<br>
assembly.   As  soon  as ball cranck  moves  because  of<br>
activation   of  impact   sensor   assembly   (2),   the<br>
compressed  concentric springs (20) get stretched  fully<br>
and  two cables 20a attached to plate get  pulled.   One<br>
cable  opens the doors where as other one activates  the<br>
head (valve) of the C02 Gas cylinder.  The gas  inflates<br>
the  dinghy (4) and the increase in volume   forces  the<br>
dinghy out of the shell.  The gases further inflates the<br>
dinghy to its maximum size.<br>
Fig.  5 shows a fully inflatted  dinghy  with<br>
canopy  (23), two buoyancy chambers (24), an entry  port<br>
(25)  and  an indicting lamp (26).  It has  rope  ladder<br>
(27)  and  lifelines  attached  all  around  to   enable<br>
survivors  holding on to the  dinghy till they are  able<br>
to  get  in.   It has also an   attachment  for  fitting<br>
anchor.<br>
Referring  to fig. 6 (a) and 6(b),  parachute<br>
with  cutters (5) is housed in tail compartment  of  the<br>
device.  On deployment of the device parachute (28) gets<br>
pulled  out from a cover (29) in which it is packed  and<br>
simultaneously  safety pins (30) of cartridge (31)  also<br>
get pulled out.  The pyro technique train gets  ignited,<br>
burns  to  give  a delay of 4  seconds  and  operates  a<br>
cartridge to activate the cutter.  During the 4  seconds<br>
the aircraft moves forward to safe distance, so that the<br>
opened  parachute does not interact with aircraft.   The<br>
cutters now cut the cord of parachute pack (32) to deploy the parachute (31). The device descends vertically down with speed of 20m/s.<br>
METHOD QE1 USE<br>
Referring  to fig. 7, the functioning of  the<br>
complete  system  is  described  herein  briefly.    The<br>
aircraft, after location of survivors, positions  itself<br>
500  meters  from  them taking  into  consideration  the<br>
direction of wind and tide in that area.  Aircraft moves<br>
further and releases the device such that it should fall<br>
in  vicinity  of  approximately  200  meters  from   the<br>
survivors.   On  release a lanyard pulls out   parachute<br>
from the  cover and pulls out safety pins of the cutters<br>
too.  Because of weight of the device, weak link  shears<br>
off and device gets separated from the aircraft.   While<br>
descending  down,  after delay of 4 seconds the  cutters<br>
operate  which cut the cord of pack and  parachute  gets<br>
deployed.  The device, with the parachute descends  down<br>
vertically  within  15 to 20 seconds.   On  impact  with<br>
water,  main shaft 14 of impact sensor assembly 2  moves<br>
rearward  by  which cam 18 transfers the force  to  lock<br>
release mechanism through bell crank, and roller 19.  The<br>
concentric  springs 2*0 for lock release  mechanism  pull<br>
two cables 2(3a which activate  CO  cylinder and open the doors.  The dinghy/life raft starts getting inflated and<br>
pushes doors to open.  The dinghy is thrown out of shell 1 and gets fully inflated in upright position within 15 to<br>
20 seconds.  The shell assembly connected to dinghy  (4) acts  as an  anchor which prevents drifting  of  dinghy.<br>
The  survivors  can  climb into dinghy  (4)  using  rope ladders (27).  The survivors can make use of food items,<br>
drinking  water,  medicines,  distress  signals,  torch, paddles and knife etc. till they are picked up by rescue<br>
ship.<br>
It is to be understood that the device of the<br>
invention    disclosed   herein   is   susceptible    to modifications/adaptations  by those skilled in the  art.<br>
