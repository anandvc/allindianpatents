The compounds of general formulae II to XX used as starting<br>
materials, some of which are known from the literature, may<br>
be obtained by methods known from the literature and<br>
moreover their production is described in the Examples.<br>
Thus, for example, a compound of general formula II is<br>
obtained by reacting a corresponding nitrile which in turn<br>
is conveniently obtained by processes f to h, with a<br>
corresponding thio or alcohol in the presence of hydrogen<br>
chloride or bromide.<br>
A compound of general formulae IV, V, VIII, X and IXX used<br>
as starting material is conveniently obtained according to<br>
a process of the present invention.<br>
A starting compound of general formula XI in which U<br>
denotes a halomethyl group is conveniently obtained by<br>
cyclisation of a corresponding ester which is substituted<br>
in the o-position by a suitable halogen atom and a<br>
methoxyacetamido group, to form a corresponding bicyclic 2-<br>
alkoxymethyl compound, optionally subsequent hydrolysis and<br>
optionally subsequent amidation of a resulting carboxylic<br>
acid with a corresponding amine, converting the<br>
alkoxytnethyl compound thus obtained into the corresponding<br>
halomethyl compound, which can if necessary be subsequently<br>
converted into the desired compound by means of a suitable<br>
compound. If the cyclisation is carried out with a<br>
suitable carbonic acid derivative, a starting compound of<br>
general formula XI is obtained wherein U denotes a hydroxy,<br>
mercapto or amino group.<br>
A starting compound of general formula XIII is obtained by<br>
cyclisation of a corresponding o-disubstituted ester,<br>
followed by saponification of the resulting ester and<br>
- 37 -<br>
subsequent amidation of the carboxylic acid thus obtained<br>
with a corresponding amine.<br>
Furthermore, an imidazopyridine substituted in the 5-<br>
position by a methyl group and obtained by cyclisation can<br>
be converted, via the corresponding N-oxide, into the<br>
corresponding hydroxymethyl compound which is converted by<br>
oxidation into the desired carboxylic acid of general<br>
formula XIII.<br>
The compounds of general formulae III, VI, VII, IX and XII<br>
used as starting materials are obtained by conventional<br>
methods, for example by reducing an aromatic ester<br>
substituted in the o-position by an optionally substituted<br>
amino group and a nitro group, and optionally subsequent<br>
cyclisation of the resulting o-diamino compound with a<br>
corresponding carboxylic acid.<br>
Furthermore, the compounds of general formula I obtained<br>
may be separated into their enantiomers and/or<br>
diastereomers.<br>
Thus, for example, the compounds of general formula I<br>
obtained which occur in racemate form may be separated by<br>
methods known per ae (see Allinger N. L. and Eliel E. L. in<br>
"Topics in Stereochemistry", Vol. 6, Wiley Interscience,<br>
1971) into their optical antipodes, and compounds of<br>
general formula I having at least 2 asymmetric carbon atoms<br>
may be separated on the basis of their physical-chemical<br>
differences using known methods, e.g. by chromatography<br>
and/or fractional crystallisation, into the diastereomers<br>
thereof, which, if they occur in racemic form, may<br>
subsequently be separated into the enantiomers as mentioned<br>
above.<br>
The separation of enantiomers is preferably effected by<br>
column separation on chiral phases or by recrystallisation<br>
- 38 -<br>
from an optically active solvent or by reacting with an<br>
optically active substance, especially acids and the<br>
activated derivatives thereof or alcohols, which forms<br>
salts or derivatives such as e.g. esters or amides with the<br>
racemic compound, and separation of the diastereomeric salt<br>
mixture or derivative thus obtained, e.g. on the basis of<br>
their different solubilities, whilst the free antipodes may<br>
be released from the pure diastereomeric salts or<br>
derivatives by the action of suitable agents. Particularly<br>
common, optically active acids are, for example, the D- and<br>
L-forms of tartaric acid, and dibenzoyltartaric acid, di-otolyl<br>
tartaric acid, malic acid, mandelic acid,<br>
camphorsulphonic acid, glutamic acid, aspartic acid and<br>
quinaldic acid. Examples of optically active alcohols<br>
include for example (+)- or (-)-menthol and examples of<br>
optically active acyl groups in amides include, for<br>
example, (+)- or (-)-menthyloxycarbonyl.<br>
Moreover, the compounds of formula I obtained may be<br>
converted into the salts thereof, particularly for<br>
pharmaceutical use into the physiologically acceptable<br>
salts thereof with inorganic or organic acids. Examples of<br>
suitable acids include for example hydrochloric acid,<br>
hydrobromic acid, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, fumaric<br>
acid, succinic acid, lactic acid, citric acid, tartaric<br>
acid or maleic acid.<br>
In addition, the new compounds of formula I thus obtained,<br>
if they contain a carboxyl group, may subsequently, if<br>
desired, be converted into the salts thereof with inorganic<br>
or organic bases, more particularly, for pharmaceutical<br>
use, into the physiologically acceptable salts thereof.<br>
Examples of suitable bases include for example sodium<br>
hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, cyclohexylamine,<br>
ethanolamine, diethanolamine and triethanolamine.<br>
- 39 -<br>
As already mentioned, the new compounds of general formula<br>
I and the salts thereof have valuable properties. Thus,<br>
the compounds of general formula I wherein E denotes a<br>
cyano group are valuable intermediate products for<br>
preparing the other compounds of general formula I and the<br>
compounds of general formula I wherein E denotes an<br>
RbNH-C(=NH)~ group and the tautomers, the stereoisomers and<br>
the physiologically acceptable salts thereof have valuable<br>
pharmacological properties, particularly a thrombininhibiting<br>
effect, an effect of prolonging the thrombin<br>
time and an inhibitory effect on related serine proteases<br>
such as e.g. trypsin, urokinase factor Vila, factor Xa,<br>
factor IX, factor XI and factor XII, whilst a few compounds<br>
such as for example the compound of Example 16<br>
simultaneously also have a slight inhibitory effect on<br>
thrombocyte aggregation.<br>

A = 2-[N-(4-amidinophenyl)-aminomethyl]-benzthiazole-<br>

Method:<br>
The thrombin time was determined using a Biomatic BIO<br>
coagulometer made by Messrs. Sarstedt.<br>
As the test substance, 0.1 ml of human citrated plasma and<br>
0.1 ml diethylbarbiturate buffer (DBA buffer) were added to<br>
the test strip prescribed by the manufacturer. The mixture<br>
was incubated for one minute at 37°C. The clotting<br>
reaction was started by the addition of 0.3 U test thrombin<br>
in 0.1 ml DBA buffer. The time is measured using the<br>
apparatus from the addition of the thrombin up to the<br>
clotting of the mixture. Mixtures to which 0.1 ml of DBA<br>
buffer were added were used as the controls.<br>
According to the definition, a dosage-activity curve was<br>
used to determine the effective concentration of the<br>

substance, i.e. the concentration at which the thrombin<br>
time is double compared with the control.<br>

By way of example, no acute toxic side effects were<br>
observed when compounds A, D, E and G were administered to<br>
rats in doses of up to 10 mg/kg i.v. The compounds are thus<br>
well tolerated.<br>
In view of their pharmacological properties the new<br>
compounds and the physiologically acceptable salts thereof<br>
are suitable for the prevention and treatment of venous and<br>
arterial thrombotic diseases, such as for example the<br>
treatment of deep leg vein thrombosis, for preventing<br>
reocclusions after bypass operations or angioplasty<br>
(PT(C)A), and occlusion in peripheral arterial diseases<br>
such as pulmonary embolism, disseminated intravascular<br>
coagulation, for preventing coronary thrombosis, stroke and<br>
the occlusion of shunts or stents. In addition, the<br>
compounds according to the invention are suitable for<br>
antithrombotic support in thrombolytic treatment, such as<br>
for example with rt-PA or streptokinase, for preventing<br>
long-term restenosis after PT(C)A, for preventing<br>
metastasis and the growth of clot-dependent tumours and<br>
fibrin-dependent inflammatory processes.<br>
