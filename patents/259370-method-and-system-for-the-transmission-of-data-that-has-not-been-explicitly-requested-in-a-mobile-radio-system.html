				<td>The invention relates to a system and a method for the transmission of data that has not been explicitly requested in a mobile radio system.<br>
The volume of information, such as data or multimedia content for example, exchanged in mobile radio networks based on packet transmission is growing all the time. Since requesting information using the keypad of a mobile radio receiver is not very convenient, it is possible to request the desired information using so-called push services. In this case information is automatically delivered by a server to the mobile radio receiver without the latter having explicitly requested the specific data.<br>
The mobile radio user typically specifies a group of topics or a general information field, according to which the desired information is then delivered to him on his mobile radio receiver. In technical terms, push services are network-initiated point-to-point services.<br>
The basic design of a possible push service system is described in the TR 23.974 specification of the 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project) organization.<br>
Problems emerge however because the information transmitted using the push service is not delivered to the mobile radio user following an actual request by said user. Mobile radio receivers have only a limited storage capacity for incoming information. Problems can therefore arise because the sender of the information does not know whether he can still send the information to the mobile radio receiver.<br>
Incoming information is usually indicated by the mobile radio receiver with the aid of an acoustic signal. If information is continually arriving in the mobile radio receiver, then this constitutes an annoyance for the mobile radio subscriber. It is therefore desirable to find a way of receiving push services with which the user of this service is not constantly disturbed by incoming messages.<br>
Moreover, with known push services there is the problem that when a large volume of data is received, the user has difficulty deciding which data is important for him and which he has received as information that is less important to him. It is therefore desirable for the user of push services to receive the data in accordance with its importance.<br>
The object of the present invention is to disclose an improved system for the transmission of data that has not been explicitly requested in a mobile radio system.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention by a transmission system having the features of claims 1 and 8, or respectively by a transmission method having the features of claims 16 and 23. Preferred embodiments emerge from the dependent claims.<br>
The system according to the invention for the transmission of data that has not been explicitly requested in a mobile radio system has an application computer, a transmission network and a mobile radio receiver. The application computer may be, for example, an application server which sends the push services to the mobile radio receiver via a transmission network, for example an Internet protocol connection.<br>
The transmission network is a network that enables the connection between the application computer and the mobile radio receiver. The transmission network may be, for example, a GPRS (General Packet Radio Service) network.<br>
The mobile radio receiver is a terminal that supports the use of push services.<br>
If information is to be forwarded from the application computer to the mobile radio receiver, then this is only sensible if the transmission network knows how much storage space is available to the mobile radio receiver to store push service information. For this reason, the mobile radio receiver indicates to the transmission network how much storage space is still available to it for storing the push services.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the mobile radio receiver also indicates to the transmission network when no more storage space for data is available in the mobile radio receiver.<br>
If the need should nevertheless arise to send information to the mobile radio receiver even although storage space is no longer available in the mobile radio receiver, there are basically two options. On the one hand, information not sent can be buffered. As soon as storage space becomes available in the mobile radio receiver again, said buffered information is forwarded to the mobile radio receiver.<br>
On the other hand, according to one embodiment of the present invention, it is also possible for the mobile radio receiver to release already occupied storage areas for overwriting with received information. This is conceivable, for example, for storage areas to which less relevant information has been written. The user has the option here of defining which information he considers less important, or which particular storage areas are to be released for overwriting with more important information respectively.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the transmission network has a storage means for buffering data received from the application computer. The storage means may be any known<br>
type of storage here. The information of the push service is forwarded from the application computer to the transmission network. If it is not immediately possible to forward the information to the particular mobile radio receiver, the information is buffered in the storage means. It is thus always possible to send data from the application computer to the transmission network. As soon as the mobile radio receiver is ready to receive again, the buffered data is forwarded from the storage means to the mobile radio receiver.<br>
The forwarding of the buffered data depends here on the information indicated by the mobile radio receiver. For instance, if the mobile radio receiver indicates to the transmission network that no storage is currently available for receiving information, then the storage means stores the data intended for the mobile radio receiver until the mobile radio receiver indicates to the transmission network that sufficient storage space is again available for receiving the data. The information is exchanged here via the air interface.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the present invention, the transmission network has a network computer which initiates the transmission to the mobile radio receiver. The network computer receives from the mobile radio receiver information relating to its available storage capacity. The initiation of a transmission by the network computer is performed here depending on the information indicated by the mobile radio receiver. The network computer thus executes certain control functions in the transmission system. The network computer knows which data is buffered in the storage means, or which data transmission to the mobile radio receiver has not yet been executed.<br>
The invention also relates to a system for the transmission of data that has not been explicitly requested in a mobile radio system, in which the mobile radio system has an application computer, a transmission network and a mobile radio receiver, and the mobile radio receiver notifies the transmission network of information relating to the transmission of the data.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the information of the mobile radio receiver indicates to the transmission network when the data is to be sent to the mobile radio receiver. For this purpose the transmission network is notified of a time window which is best for the data of the push service to be sent to the mobile radio receiver. The background of this is that the user does not want to be continually disturbed by receiving the push services. As a result of this procedure, the user always knows exactly when new push service data can arrive. In this case the mobile radio subscriber determines the time of transmission by means of an input on his mobile radio receiver. It is however also conceivable for the network operator to determine the time of transmission, e.g. depending on the network load.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the mobile radio receiver transmits the desired time of transmission of the data to a network computer, which initiates the transmission accordingly.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the present invention, the information of the mobile radio receiver indicates to the transmission network the order in which the data is to be sent to the mobile radio receiver. If a user has subscribed to a plurality of push services, he can assign a particular value to each push service. If several push services arrive, the data is transmitted to the mobile radio receiver in accordance with the value, that is to say with a higher or lower priority. For instance, it is possible here to assign stockmarket information a higher priority than sports information. A new item of stockmarket information is then forwarded to the user more quickly than a new item of sports information. It is however also conceivable for the network operator to specify the values.<br>
The same applies analogously when a storage means is used to buffer information received from the application computer. The processing,<br><br>
i.e. the forwarding of the buffered information, is again performed on the basis of the values assigned to the push service to which the user has subscribed.<br>
The buffered data is forwarded depending on the information indicated by the mobile radio receiver. The user thus determines in which way he wishes to receive the push services.<br>
The network computer receives the information relevant for the time or order of transmission from the mobile radio receiver. The network computer thus executes certain control functions in the transmission system. For instance, it also initiates the transmissions from the transmission network, i.e. the storage means, to the mobile radio receiver.<br>
The invention will be explained in greater detail below in relation to exemplary embodiments with reference to the accompanying drawings. The features illustrated there and also the features already described above may be essential to the invention not only in the combinations stated, but also individually or in different combinations. In the drawings:<br>
Figure 1 shows a schematic representation of a system for the<br>
transmission of data that has not been explicitly requested in a mobile radio system; and<br>
Figure 2 shows a schematic representation of a system for the<br>
transmission of data that has not been explicitly requested in a mobile radio system in the case of transmission dependent on a value.<br>
Figure 1 shows an application computer 1, a transmission network 2 having a storage means 4 and a network computer 5. Figure 1 also shows a mobile radio receiver 3. Push service data is, as indicated by the arrow 7, sent from the application computer 1 to the transmission network 2. Said data is buffered there in the storage<br>
means 4. As indicated by the arrow 8, the network computer 5 receives from the mobile radio receiver 3 information relating to the available storage capacity in the mobile radio receiver. Depending on said information, the data stored in the storage means 4 is sent, as shown by the arrow 10, to the mobile radio receiver 3.<br>
If, for example, a large amount of information is to be sent from the application computer 1 to the transmission network 3, and the network computer 5 has learned from the mobile radio receiver 3 that the latter currently does not have sufficient storage space available for receiving the information of the application computer 1, then the data is buffered in the storage means 4. As soon as sufficient storage space is available to the mobile radio receiver 3 again, e.g. because the user has read old information and then deleted it, said information is sent to the network computer 5. The network computer accordingly initiates a forwarding of the information buffered in the storage means 4 to the mobile radio receiver 3.<br>
In addition, if the mobile radio receiver 3 indicates to the network computer 5 that there is no longer sufficient storage space available to it for receiving new information, it is also possible for said receiver to release storage areas for overwriting with newly received data. It would also be conceivable for information already read by the user, but which nevertheless continues to be stored in the mobile radio receiver, to be overwritten here. The information as to which storage areas can be overwritten is forwarded to the network computer 5 under the user's control. The network computer 3 initiates the further transmission accordingly.<br>
Figure 2 shows a further exemplary embodiment of the system according to the invention for the transmission of data that has not been explicitly requested in a mobile radio system. The elements of application computer, transmission system, storage means, network computer and mobile radio receiver are represented in Figure 2 analogously to those explained above with reference to Figure 1.<br>
Arrows 6, 7, 8 indicate that information can arrive from the application computer 1 sequentially in the transmission network 2, i.e. the storage means 4.<br>
In one exemplary embodiment, data buffered in the storage means 4 is sent sequentially in series from a particular point in time to the mobile radio receiver 3. The first data stream 9 is therefore sent, then the data stream 10 and finally the data stream 11. In this case the user specifies to the network computer 5 via the mobile radio receiver 3 the time information relating to when he wishes to receive the data of the push service.<br>
In another exemplary embodiment, data relating to different push service topics is sent from the application computer 1 to the transmission network 2. For instance, traffic bulletins are received first via the data stream 6. This is followed by weather reports via the data stream 7, and finally politics news via the data stream 8. The data is buffered in the storage means 4. Since weather information has the highest priority for the user, and also politics news is more important to him than traffic bulletins, he has accordingly notified the network computer 5 that in the case of buffered information he always wishes to receive the weather information, then the politics news, and finally traffic bulletins. Accordingly, weather information is sent first via the data stream 9, then politics news is sent via the data stream 10, and finally traffic bulletins are sent via the data stream 11 from the' storage means 4 to the mobile radio receiver 3.<br>
It can also be arranged for this procedure to be used only if buffering is used because of a lack of storage capacity in the mobile radio receiver 3. It is furthermore also conceivable for push service information always to be buffered for a given period of time so that a selection based on its importance can be made. A combination with a time-dependent transmission is accordingly also possible.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
