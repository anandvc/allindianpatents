CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application 60/648,153<br>
filed on January 28, 2005. The provisional application is incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH<br>
This invention was made with United States government support awarded by<br>
the National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease<br>
(Grant No. AI053725). The United States government has certain rights in this<br>
invention.<br>
INTRODUCTION<br>
The CD1d molecule is a member of the CD1 family of b2 microglobulin-<br>
associated molecules. In contrast to class I and II major histocompatibility complex<br>
(MHC) molecules that present protein antigens to CD8+ and CD4+ T cells,<br>
respectively, CD1 molecules have evolved to capture and process both foreign and<br>
self lipid antigens for display to T cells. CD1a, -b, and -c molecules have been<br>
shown to present foreign microbial antigens to human TCRab T cells. In contrast,<br>
CDId-restricted T cells, or NKT cells, are a population of innate-like<br>
memory/effector cells expressing both NK receptors and a conserved, semi-<br>
invariant TCR (Va14-Ja18/Vb8 in mice and Va24-Ja18/Vb11 in humans). Like NK<br>
cells, NKT cells constitutively express mRNA but not protein for IFN-g, evidencing<br>
their poised effector stage. NKT cells have been implicated in suppression of<br>
autoimmunity and graft rejection, promotion of resistance to pathogens, and<br>
promotion of tumor immunity.<br>
While NKT cells are known to respond to a-GalactosylCeramide (aGal-Cer),<br>
a surrogate ligand derived from a marine sponge, lack of knowledge of their natural<br>
antigens has previously precluded understanding of the mechanisms of their<br>
peripheral activation and recruitment, as well as their thymic development.<br>
The inventors have previously identified a natural endogenous antigen,<br>
isoglobotrihexosylceramide (iGb3), which is presented to NKT cells by LPS-<br>
activated dendritic cells. This work suggests that iGb3 is a primary ligand for NKT<br>
cells. However, the partial diversity of the b-chain of the TCR suggests that multiple<br>
natural antigen specificity may be possible.<br>
2<br><br>
SUMMARY<br>
Described herein is the inventors' surprising discovery that glycolipids<br>
derived from members of the Class Alphaproteobacteria also act as natural ligands<br>
of CD1d molecules to activate NKT cells.<br>
In one aspect, the invention provides a method of activating an NKT cell<br>
comprising contacting the NKT cell with a bacterial glycolipid complexed with a<br>
CD1d molecule. In some embodiments, the bacterial glycolipid may be derived from<br>
a member of the class Alphaproteobacteria.<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides a method of inducing cytokine<br>
expression by an NKT cell comprising contacting a T-cell receptor of the NKT cell<br>
with a bacterial glycolipid complexed with a CD1d molecule.<br>
In yet another aspect, the invention provides a method of stimulating an<br>
immune response in a subject comprising administering to the subject an effective<br>
amount of NKT cells activated by contacting a T-cell receptor of the NKT cells with a<br>
bacterial glycolipid complexed with a CD1d molecule.<br>
In further aspects, the invention provides methods of improving vaccine<br>
efficacy, promoting tumor rejection, modulating autoimmunity, inhibiting allergen-<br>
induced hypersensitivity, and treating an infection in a subject by administration of<br>
an effective amount of a bacterial glycolipid derived from a member of the Class<br>
Alphaproteobacteria.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SEVERAL EMBODIMENTS<br>
CD1- restricted T cells carry out both effector and helper functions and<br>
interact with a variety of cell types, including macrophages, dendritic cells, NK cells,<br>
T cells and B cells, thereby contributing to both innate and adaptive immune<br>
responses. A subset of these T cells, NKT cells, also known as CD Id-restricted T<br>
cells or CD1d tetramer+ T cells, are characterized by invariant TCRa chains, self<br>
lipid reactivity and rapid effector responses. These cells play an important role in a<br>
number of immune functions, including antimicrobial responses, antitumor immunity<br>
and in regulating the balance between tolerance and autoimmunity.<br>
In the absence of foreign antigens, NKT cells are stimulated by exposure to<br>
CD1+ antigen presenting cells, such as monocytes, dendritic cells (DC) and<br>
macrophages. Classes of self-antigens that can be presented to and recognized by<br>
NKT cells include phospholipids, such as phosphatidylinositol,<br>
phosphatidylethanolamine and phophatidylglycerol, as well as sphingolipids.<br>
However, not all classes elicit a response in NKT cells in terms of cytokine release.<br>
NKT cells also are known to recognize a-galactosylceramide (aGal-Cer), a<br>
glycosphingolipid found in marine sponges. This molecule has no known<br>
immunological or other physiological function in mammals, but is widely used by<br>
investigators to study NKT activation. Prior to the present invention, activation of<br>
NKT by direct presentation of microbial glycolipids was not known.<br>
NKT cells are rapidly activated upon stimulation by CD1d presented polar<br>
lipid antigens. "Activation," as the term is used herein and in the art, refers to<br>
secretion by NKT cells of IFN-g, IL-4, IL-2, IL-10, IL-13, GM-CSF or TNF-a, or<br>
combinations of these cytokines, upon contact with CD1d presented stimulatory<br>
antigens. Alternatively, "activation" may refer to upregulated expression of cell-<br>
surface markers for activated T-cells, for example, CD69.<br>
Activation of NKT cells in accordance with the invention comprises<br>
contacting an NKT cell, or more specifically, a T cell receptor (TCR) of the NKT cell,<br>
with a CD1d-complexed bacterial polar lipid. Glycolipids are suitable species of<br>
polar lipids. Thus, in some embodiments, activation of NKT cells comprises<br>
contacting an NKT cell with a bacterial glycolipid derived from a member of the<br>
Class Alphaproteobacteria. "A T cell receptor of an NKT cell," as the term is used<br>
herein, refers to the conserved, semi-invariant TCR of NKT cells comprising, e.g.,<br>
5<br><br>
Va14-Ja18/vb8 in mice and VaT24-Ja18/Vb11 in humans. "Contacting," as used<br>
herein, refers to the in vitro addition of bacterial glycolipid in solution to immobilized,<br>
soluble, or insoluble CD1d molecules, or to the in vivo administration of bacterial<br>
glycolipid to a subject having antigen presenting cells which express cell surface<br>
CD1d molecules.<br>
Activation of NKT cells may be measured in vitro or ex vivo by any suitable<br>
method. An example of an in vitro test permitting evaluation of NKT cell activation is<br>
co-culturing NKT cells with antigen presenting cells (APC), such as dendritic cells<br>
(DC), in the presence of a bacterial glycolipid activator or putative activator, and<br>
subsequently assaying for IFN-g or other secreted cytokines in the supernatant.<br>
Alternatively, activation of NKT cells can be measured ex vivo by administering a<br>
bacterial glycolipid antigen to a subject or by administering CD1d+ antigen<br>
presenting cells after ex vivo contact with bacterial glycolipids to a subject. The<br>
NKT cells from these subjects can be isolated by, e.g., CD1d-tetramer staining and<br>
gating via flow cytometry, and subsequently assayed for surface CD69 (early T-cell<br>
activation antigen) and/or intracellular IFN-g by suitable methods.<br>
Alphaproteobacteria is a class in the phylum Proteobacteria comprised<br>
mostly of bacteria having two major phenotypes: purple non-sulfur bacteria and<br>
aerobic bacteriochlorophyll-containing bacteria. Bacterial members of the class of<br>
Alphaproteobacteria are primarily isolated from soil, lakes or ponds. Several<br>
members are known human pathogens.<br>
The class Alphaproteobacteria includes six orders: Rhodospirillales,<br>
Rickettsiales, Rhodobacterales, Sphingomonadales, Caulobacterales and<br>
Rhizobiales (Garrity, GM et al., Taxonomic Outline of the Procaryotic Genera,<br>
BERGEY'S MANUAL of Systematic Bacteriology, 2nd Ed, April 2001, incorporated<br>
herein by reference). Bacterial glycolipids which may be useful in activating NKT<br>
cells may be derived from members of any of these orders. However, members of<br>
orders Rickettsiales, Sphingomonadales and Rhizobiales are contemplated to be<br>
particularly suitable.<br>
The order Rickettsiales includes three families:	Rickettsiaceae,<br>
Ehrlichiaceae and Holosporaceae. Polar lipids derived from members of<br>
Ehrlichiaceae in the genus Ehrlichia are contemplated to be suitably used in<br>
methods of the invention. For example, E. muris- derived glycolipids may be<br>
suitable.<br>
The order Sphingomonadales includes the family Sphingomonadaceae.<br>
Glyclolipids derived from members of this family in the genus Sphingomonas, for<br>
example, from S. capsulata, are contemplated to be suitable.<br>
6<br><br>
The order Rhizobiales includes ten families: Rhizobiaceae, Bartonellaceae,<br>
Brucellaceae, Phyllobacteriaceae, Methylocystaceae, Beijerinckiaceae,<br>
Bradyrhizobiaceae, Hyphomicrobiaceae, Methylobacteriaceae and Rhodobiaceae.<br>
Glycolipids derived from members of Brucellaceae in the genus Brucella are<br>
contemplated to be suitably used in methods of the invention.<br>
Sphingomonas capsulata is a pathogen of the Alphaproteobacteria class<br>
which is a gram-negative, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-negative bacteria whose cell<br>
wall lipids have been extensively characterized. Glycolipids derived from the cell<br>
walls of these bacteria may be used to activate NKT cells in accordance with the<br>
invention.<br>
Similarly, members of the genus Ehrlichia are gram-negative, LPS-negative<br>
bacteria whose cell wall lipids may be used to activate NKT cells. Although the cell<br>
membrane lipids of Ehrlichia are not as well-characterized as those of<br>
Sphingomonas capsulata, it is contemplated that members of this genus will<br>
function to activate NKT cells in suitable activation assays, as well as in vivo.<br>
Brucella is another genus in this class known to be pathogenic. The four<br>
species of this genus that can infect humans include B. abortus, B. suis, B.<br>
melitensis and B. canis. Brucellosis disease in humans is characterized as either an<br>
acute febrile disease or a persistent disease with a wide variety of symptoms. It is a<br>
true zoonosis in that virtually all human infections are acquired from animals.<br>
Subclinical infection is common. In contrast to Erlichia and Sphingomonas spp., the<br>
outer cell membrane comprises a dominant LPS component and three main groups<br>
of proteins. It is contemplated that particular fractions or components of these<br>
bacterial cell membranes may be used to directly activate NKT cells in accordance<br>
with the invention.<br>
As noted, bacterial glycolipids are suitably derived from bacteria of the class<br>
Alphaproteobacteria. "Derived from," refers to isolation and/or purification from<br>
bacterial sources, and also refers to de novo synthesis of bacterial compounds, or<br>
compounds rationally designed based on bacterial compounds, using suitable<br>
synthetic processes known in the art. As will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill<br>
in the art, "bacterial glycolipids" may also include heat killed or attenuated bacteria<br>
in the context of the methods of the invention. For example, contacting a NKT cell<br>
with a bacterial glycolipid suitably includes contacting a NKT cell with a heat killed or<br>
attenuated bacteria, as well as isolated or synthetic bacterial glycolipids.<br>
The term "glycolipid" designates any compound containing one or more<br>
monosaccharide residues bound by a glycosidic linkage to a hydrophobic moiety<br>
such as an acylglycerol, a sphingoid, a ceramide (N-acylsphingoid) or a prenyl<br>
7<br><br>
phosphate. In particular, one or more saccharides bound to a ceramide moiety may<br>
be particularly useful in activating NKT cells.<br>
Bacterial glycolipids suitable for use in methods of activating NKT cells may<br>
be generally of the structural formula (I):<br><br>
wherein — indicates either a single bond wherein X is H or lower alkyl, or an ionic<br>
bond wherein X is a counter ion; R1 and R2 are independently selected from the<br>
group consisting of-H, -OH, a monosaccharide and an oligosaccharide; R3 is -H or -<br>
OH; R4 is -H or -OH or, together with R7, forms a double bond; R5 and R6 are<br>
independently C1-C30 alkyl, wherein the C1-C30 alkyl is saturated or unsaturated or<br>
comprises one or more cyclopropyl groups; and R7 is -H or, together with R4, forms<br>
a double bond. As used herein, the term "lower alkyl" is meant to refer to a straight<br>
or branched, saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon radical having 1 to 4 carbon<br>
atoms. Specific examples of such hydrocarbon radicals are methyl, ethyl, propyl,<br>
isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, t-butyl, ethenyl, propenyl, butenyl, isobutenyl, isopropenyl,<br>
formyl, acetyl, propionyl, butyryl or cyclopropyl. Also as used herein, a "counter ion"<br>
is any positively charged species that can associate via an ionic bond with a<br>
negatively charged carboxylate on the glycolipid.<br>
Some representative examples of suitable bacterial glycolipids for<br>
complexing with CD1d molecules and activating NKT cells are depicted in FIG. 5.<br>
PBS 30, PBS 45 and PBS 59 were synthesized based on known Sphingomonas cell<br>
membrane molecules and were found to activate NKT cells in vitro. Conversely,<br>
PBS 50 and PBS 60 do not activate NKT cells. The remaining compounds depicted<br>
in FIG. 5 were rationally designed based on the following features determined to be<br>
common among glycolipids capable of activating NKT cells: 1) an alpha-type<br>
8<br><br>
glycosidic linkage and 2) oxidation at the 6-position on the carbohydrate moiety of<br>
the glycolipid.<br>
In some embodiments, activation of NKT cells by administration of a<br>
bacterial glycolipid in accordance with the invention may provide a means by which<br>
an immune response may be stimulated in a subject. An "immune response" as<br>
used herein refers to any elevated level of humoral or cellular response that is<br>
measurable in a subject in comparison to the subject's baseline, or unstimulated,<br>
state. Methods of measuring both humoral and cellular immune responses are well-<br>
known in the art. As will be appreciated, the in vivo response of NKT cells is<br>
influenced, in part, by the cellular environment during activation. TH1 immune<br>
responses are characterized predominantly by release of, e.g., IL-2, 1FN-g, IL-12<br>
and TNF-a. In contrast, TH2 cytokines predominantly include IL-4, IL -5, IL -6, IL -<br>
10, and IL-13. The in vivo response of NKT cells may also be influenced by antigen<br>
concentration or prior, or repeated, antigen exposure. Activation may be further<br>
mediated by interactions with co-stimulatory molecules on NKT cells and APCs,<br>
e.g., CD40/CD40L interactions.<br>
In addition to cytokine secretion, activated NKT cells are potently cytolytic via<br>
release of perforin and granzymes, as well as granulysin, and can contribute directly<br>
to bacterial cell and/or tumor cell killing via secretion of these molecules.<br>
Thus, activating NKT cells in a subject by administration of an effective<br>
amount of a bacterial glycolipid to a subject may generate an anti-microbial immune<br>
response and thereby provide a means of treating an infection in the subject. The<br>
infection may be viral, bacterial or parasitic and the anti-microbial immune response<br>
may be sufficient to inhibit the growth of, or kill a microbe, including e.g., viruses,<br>
bacteria or parasites. Administration may be carried out by any method employed in<br>
the art, including intraperitoneal, intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous,<br>
transcutaneous, oral, nasopharyngeal or mucosal absorption, among others.<br>
As mentioned, methods of the invention may also be employed in the<br>
treatment of cancer, or in promoting tumor rejection, by inducing an<br>
antihyperproliferative immune response in a mammai. "Treating" or "treatment" of<br>
cancer in a mammal includes one or more of: (1) inhibiting growth of the cancer, i.e.,<br>
arresting its development, (2) preventing spread of the cancer, i.e. preventing<br>
metastases, (3) relieving the cancer, i.e., causing regression of the cancer, (4)<br>
preventing recurrence of the cancer, (5) palliating symptoms of the cancer, and (6)<br>
promoting rejection of one or more solid tumors.<br>
In a particular embodiment, bacterial glycolipids in accordance with the<br>
invention can be administered as an adjuvant to improve vaccine efficacy when co-<br>
9<br><br>
administered with a vaccine. As used herein the term "co-administration" or "co-<br>
administering" refers to administration of at least two components concurrently, i.e.,<br>
simultaneously in time, or sequentially, i.e., administration of one component,<br>
followed by administration of the other component.<br>
Adoptive transfer methods are based on administering cells that have been<br>
contacted with bacterial glycolipids ex vivo to stimulate an immune response in a<br>
subject. In some embodiments, the cells may be NKT cells that are activated ex<br>
vivo and injected into a subject to provide or enhance an immune response to, e.g.,<br>
cancerous cells or microbes. In some embodiments, administration of activated<br>
NKT cells may induce an antihyperproliferative immune response to promote solid<br>
tumor rejection. In other embodiments, the cells may be antigen presenting cells<br>
that have been contacted with bacterial glycolipids ex vivo to allow complexing of<br>
the bacterial glycolipids with the CD1d molecules expressed by the antigen<br>
presenting cell, e.g., a dendritic cell. Antigen presenting cells can then be<br>
administered, e.g., by injection into the subject, to provide a suitable immune<br>
response. This method of administration allows for stimulation of the immune<br>
response with minimal exposure of the subject or the subject's cells to the bacterial<br>
glycolipids.<br>
Activation of NKT cells may also be employed in methods of modulating<br>
autoimmunity or inhibiting allergen-induced hypersensitivity. Both direct<br>
administration of bacterial glycolipids, as well as adoptive transfer methods are<br>
contemplated for these particular treatments.<br>
The following examples are provided to assist in a further understanding of<br>
the invention. The particular materials and conditions employed are intended to be<br>
further illustrative of the invention and are not limiting upon the reasonable scope<br>
thereof.<br>
Example 1. In vitro stimulation of NKT cells with heat-killed bacteria.<br>
Bacterial strains Sphingomonas capsulata (ATCC 14666) and Salmonella<br>
typhimurium R71 were grown in Mueller-Hinton Agar. Ehrlichia muris were prepared<br>
as described by Ismail N et al., J. Immunol. 172, 1786-1800 (2004), incorporated<br>
herein by reference. Bacteria were heat killed by 2-hour exposure to 74°C and 2.5 -<br>
5x106 cfu equivalent/well were used for in vitro stimulation.<br>
Stimulation assays were performed with whole spleen cells (5x105 per 200 ml<br>
well) or with purified T cells and antigen presenting cells. T cell populations used in<br>
the assays comprised sorted CD1d-aGal-Cer+ mouse spleen cells (5x104 per 200ml<br>
well), human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) (5x105 per 200ml well) (obtained<br>

after Ficoll centrifugation of heparinized blood) or human NKT cell lines (2.5x105 per<br>
200ml well). Human Va24 NKT cells were derived from PBL stimulated with aGal-<br>
Cer and were maintained by repeated rounds of stimulation with PHA and IL-2 in the<br>
presence of irradiated PBMC and EBV transformed B cells in vitro. Antigen<br>
presenting cells were dendritic cells that were derived from bone marrow, stimulated<br>
with GMCSF/IL-4 (2 ng/mL and 5 ng/mL, Biosource) and cultured at 2.5x105 per 200<br>
ml well for mouse assays, and irradiated allogeneic human PBMC fresh or cultured<br>
for 5 days with recombinant human GMCSF/IL-4, (100 mg/mL of each cytokine, R&amp;D<br>
Systems) (2x105 per 200 ml well) for human assays. Cells were washed twice and<br>
starved for 6 hours in medium alone before addition to the stimulation experiments.<br>
NKT cells were stimulated with heat-killed bacteria as indicated above for 48<br>
hrs in 96 well round bottom plates in RPMI 1640 (Biofluids) supplemented with<br>
glutamine, antibiotics, 5x10-5 M 2-ME and 10% FCS (mouse studies) or 5% AB<br>
serum (human studies). Concentrations of mouse and human IFN-g. in the<br>
supernatant were measured at 48 hours using the respective ELISA kits (BD<br>
Bioscience, lower detection limit of 12.5 pg/ml).<br>
Whole spleen cells were stimulated for 6 days with 5x108 heat killed bacteria<br>
or 100 ng/mL aGal-Cer, and the frequency of CD1d-aGal-Cer+ NKT cells were<br>
measured at stimulation and 2,4 and 6 days post-stimulation.<br>
At 6 days post stimulation, CD1d-aGal-Cer, CFSE and aB220 (BD<br>
Pharmingen) labeling and staining procedures were performed and cells were<br>
analyzed by FACS. To generate CD1d-aGal-Cer tetramers, a mixture of 5 ml of<br>
aGal-Cer (from 1mg/ml stock solution in DMSO), 10 ml of PBS 0.5% Tween 20, 10<br>
ml of biotinylated CD1d (1 mg/ml), and 75 ml of PBS was incubated at 37°C for 1 hr,<br>
and lipid-loaded CD1d was purified by centrifugation dialysis and complexed with<br>
streptavidin-APC. (Benlagha K. et al., J. Exp. Med. 191, 1895-1903 (2000).) Cells<br>
were analyzed on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) with CellQuest software.<br>
Results are reported in FIGS. 1A-C. Mouse CD1d tetramer-sorted NKT cells<br>
co-cultured with fresh bone marrow derived CD1+/- or CD1-/- DC secreted IFN-g in a<br>
CD1d-dependent manner when stimulated with heat killed Sphingomonas and<br>
Erlichia, as well as control Salmonella and aGal-Cer. (FIG. 1A, left.) Similarly,<br>
human NKT cells co-cultured with PBMC-derived DC secreted IFN-g in a CD1d-<br>
dependent manner upon stimulation, where CD1d dependence was illustrated using<br>
blocking with 1 mg/mL anti-CD1d antibodies or control IgGl (FIG. 1A, right.) Whole<br>
spleen cell suspensions cultured in the presence of heat-killed bacteria for 6 days<br>
showed a marked expansion and proliferation of NKT cells, only slightly less than<br>
that induced by pure aGal-Cer. (FIG. 1B-C.)<br>
11<br><br>
Example 2. Differential requirements for the IFN-Y response to Sphingomonas<br>
and Ehrlichia versus Salmonella.<br>
Whole spleen cells co-cultured with DC of genotype MyD88-1-, Triflps2/lps2 and<br>
MyD88-1-Trif lps2/lps2 (lacking one or the two adaptors MyD88 and TRIF for TLR<br>
signaling) or CD1-l- were stimulated for 48 hours with 5x106 heat killed Salmonella,<br>
Sphingomonas or Ehrlichia. Concentrations of mouse and human IFN-y. in the<br>
supernatant were measured at 48 hours using the respective ELISA kits (BD<br>
Bioscience, lower detection limit of 12.5 pg/ml).<br>
DC were pulsed with heat-killed bacteria, prepared as described in Example<br>
1 and added to human NKT cell preparations in the presence of IB4 (Griffonia<br>
Simplicifolia isolectin B4) (Vector Laboratories) which binds the terminal<br>
disaccharide of iGb3, but does not bind to aGal-Cer. IFN-y production was<br>
measured at 48 hours.<br>
Hexb-l- DC, which fail to generate iGb3 in the lysosome because they lack<br>
the b-hexosaminidase needed to remove the terminal GalNAc of iGb4, the precursor<br>
of iGb3, were pulsed with heat-killed bacteria as described above and added to NKT<br>
cell cultures. IFN-Y production was measured at 48 hours.<br>
Results are reported in FIGS. 2A-C. In the whole spleen cell culture assay,<br>
Salmonella-induced IFN-Y was drastically reduced to 2-15% of control, on average,<br>
in the absence of either one or the two TLR adaptors (FIG. 2A). In sharp contrast,<br>
the splenic IFN-Y response to LPS-negative Ehrlichia and Sphingomonas was<br>
largely independent of MyD88 and TRIF. CD1d-l- spleen cells lacking NKT cells<br>
failed to respond to Sphingomonas and Ehrlichia, whereas the response to<br>
Salmonella was only marginally reduced (FIG. 2A, left). Likewise, wild type NKT<br>
cells co-cultured with MyD88-deficient DC responded to Sphingomonas and<br>
Ehrlichia but not Salmonella (FIG. 2A, right). Altogether, these results suggested<br>
that in total spleens exposed to heat-killed Salmonella, IFN-K production was<br>
initiated after TLR signaling of antigen presenting cells and subsequent recruitment<br>
of NKT cells as well as other cell-types such as NK cells.. In contrast, IFN-Y<br>
stimulation by Ehrlichia and Sphingomonas was primarily dependent on NKT cells<br>
and CD1d with minimal contribution of TLR.<br>
Similarly, lectin IB4 binding did not impair the stimulation of NKT cells by DC<br>
pulsed with heat-killed Ehrlichia or Sphingomonas, consistent with direct recognition<br>
of a distinct microbial antigen. However, the lectins readily blocked stimulation by<br>
Salmonella (FIG. 2B), suggesting that for the Salmonella NKT response,<br>
endogenous iGb3 is the likely ligand.<br>
12<br><br>
Hexb-l- DC pulsed with heat-killed Ehrlichia or Sphingomonas stimulated<br>
NKT cells as well as wild-type DC. (FIG. 2C) In contrast, Salmonella-pulsed Hexb-l-<br>
DC did not stimulate NKT cells.<br>
Together, the results identify the endogenous ligand iGb3, rather than a<br>
microbial antigen, as the target of NKT cells in their response to Salmonella<br>
infection.<br>
Example 3. NKT cell stimulatory response to synthetic glycolipid antigens.<br>
a-glucuronosylceramide (PBS 30) and a-galacturonosylceramide (PBS 59),<br>
derived from known Sphingomonadaceae cell membrane antigens, were<br>
synthesized as described in Example 5. PBS 50, a b-glucuronosylceramide, served<br>
as a control compound. The structures of these compounds are shown in FIG. 3A.<br>
The immunological properties of the above compounds in NKT cells were<br>
measured. Human Va24-Ja18 NKT cells and fresh purified mouse NKT cells were<br>
co-cultured with DC pulsed with aGal-Cer or synthetic glycolipid at concentrations<br>
ranging from 0.001 to 1000 ng/mL. IFN-Y production was measured at 48 hours as<br>
described above.<br>
CD1d tetramers were prepared as described in Example 1 using synthetic<br>
glycolipids PBS 30, PBS 59 and PBS 50 and oGal-Cer, and were used to stain<br>
human NKT cells and mouse spleen cells.<br>
Results are shown in FIGS. 3 B-C. Both a-glucuronosylceramide (PBS 30)<br>
and to a lesser degree, a-galacturonosylceramide (PBS 59) strongly activated<br>
mouse and human NKT cell proliferation as well as IFN-y secretion, whereas control<br>
b-glucuronosylceramide (PBS 50) did not (FIG. 3B). Tetramers of CD1d-a-<br>
glucuronosylceramide (PBS 30) stained all human NKT cells and ~25% of mouse<br>
NKT cells (FIG. 3C). Thus, these findings revealed that the lipids replacing LPS in<br>
the cell wall of some species of Gram-negative bacteria may be directly recognized<br>
by the conserved TCR of innate-like NKT cells.<br>
Example 4. In vivo role of NKT cells during microbial infection.<br>
CD1d-l- mice were generated at the University of Chicago, Ja18-l- mice were<br>
obtained from Dr. Taniguchi, Chiba University (Japan) and Hexb-l- mice were<br>
obtained from R. Proia, National Institutes of Health. All mice were in the C57/BL6<br>
background. In all cases, littermates obtained from heterozygous matings were<br>
genotyped by PCR and used for comparative analysis. All mice were raised in a<br>
pathogen-free environment at University of Chicago according to the Institutional<br>
Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines.<br>
13<br><br>
Six- to seven-week old C57/BL6 mice were intravenously inoculated with<br>
100 ml Sphingomonas (1x107), Ehrlichia (1x108) or Salmonella (1x106) suspended in<br>
PBS. Twenty-four hours post-infection, isolated NKT cells gated as tetramer+/B220-<br>
were analyzed by FACS for surface CD69 (early T-cell activation antigen) and<br>
intracellular IFN-Y. Results, shown in FIG. 4A, confirm that NKT cells are activated<br>
and secrete IFN-Y within 24 hours after infection in vivo.<br>
To determine whether hexb is required for antigen processing in response to<br>
Salmonella and Sphingomonas infection in vivo, Hexb+/-and Hexb+/- littermates were<br>
challenged intraperitoneally with 5x106 Sphingomonas or Salmonella. Two hours<br>
post-challenge, 5x106 CFSE-labelled Va14 transgenic thymocytes were<br>
intrasplenically injected in a volume of 50ml (Bendelac A. et al., J. Exp. Med. 184,<br>
1285-12293 (1996), incorporated herein by reference). At 24 hours post-challenge,<br>
intracellular staining for IFN-Y was performed. Results are shown in FIG. 4B. The<br>
difference between Hexb+/- and Hexb+/- was statistically significant only for<br>
Salmonella challenged mice, demonstrating that IFN-Y production by NKT cells in<br>
response to Salmonella infection requires lysosomal iGb3, whereas the response of<br>
NKT cells to Sphingomonas does not require lysosomal iGb3.<br>
To characterize the role of NKT cells in controlling infection in vivo, Ja18-/-<br>
and CD1-/- mice and their littermate controls were injected intravenously with either<br>
5x106 or 1x106 Sphingomonas. Bacterial burden in the lungs was assessed at<br>
intervals indicated in FIG. 4C. Bacterial counts were performed after tissue<br>
homogenization in 0.5% Triton X-100 and cultured for colony formation. The results<br>
demonstrate that both Ja18-/- and CD1-/- mice had delayed bacterial clearance<br>
compared to heterozygous littermate controls, with up to 12-14 times higher<br>
bacterial load in the lung at early time points.<br>
For survival experiments, Ja18-/- and CD1-/- mice and their littermate controls<br>
were injected intravenously with a high dose of 5x108 Sphingomonas. Dead or<br>
moribund (euthanized) mice were recorded every 2-4 hours post-infection. The<br>
results, shown in FIG. 4D, demonstrate that infection with a high dose of<br>
Sphingomonas was rapidly lethal in wild-type mice, whereas a majority of NKT<br>
deficient mice survived.<br>
To test whether lethality was associated with cytokine release,<br>
Sphingomonas (1x107) was intravenously injected in Ja18-/- and CD1-/- mice and<br>
their littermate controls. At intervals specified in FIG. 4E, serum levels of IFN-Y and<br>
IL-12 p40 were measured. The results indicate that the lethal outcome in wild-type<br>
mice was associated with the explosive release of IFN-Y and IL-12 in the serum,<br>
whereas NKT deficient mice produced significantly less cytokines.<br>
14<br><br>
For Ehrlichia infection experiments, mice were infected intraperitoneally with<br>
500ml of a 10-1 dilution of Ehrlichia muris stock. The Ehrlichia load in the lungs,<br>
livers and spleens of CD1d-/- and control Itttermates was determined by real-time<br>
PCR of the Ehrlichia dsb gene (Ismail, N. et al., J. Immunol. 172, 1786-1800 (2004))<br>
at 2 and 7 days post-infection. Results, reported in FIG. 4F, show that NKT<br>
deficient mice demonstrate an inability to clear Ehrlichia.<br>
Example 5. Synthesis of bacterial glycolipid PBS 61.<br>
FIG. 6 depicts a suitable route of synthesis for PBS 61. To a vigorously<br>
stirred solution of compound "1" (Ando, H.; Manabe, S.; Nakahara, Y.; Ito, Y.<br>
Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2001, 40, 4725-4728.) (453 mg, 0.976 mmol) in CH2CI2 (3<br>

bis(acetoxy)iodobenzene (BAIB) (345 mg, 1.07 mmol) to produce intermediate<br>
compound "2" in FIG. 6. Additional BAIB (345 mg, 1.07 mmol) was added after 1<br>
hour. The reaction was stirred until TLC indicated complete conversion of the<br>
starting material (~1.5 hour). The reaction mixture was extracted with CH2CI2 twice<br>
and the combined organic layers were dried over MgSO4 and concentrated. A short<br>
