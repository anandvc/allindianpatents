				<td>The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of Hemiacetal 4- Hydroxy-6, 6-dimethyl -3- oxabicyclo [3,1,0] - Hexan 2-one (Hemiacetal) from the Enol-lactone of (-)-lR-cis-2, 2-Dimethyl -3-(2'- oxopropyl)-cyclo propane ca'rboxylic acid (C9-Enol lactone).<br>
Hemiacetal is an important intermediate for many insecticides such as Deltamethrin, Lambdacyhalothrin, Alphamethrin and Tralomethrin.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
The preparation of Hemiacetal from C9- Enol-lactone by ozonolysis followed by reductive quenching is known in prior art. Many reducing agents such as Sodium sulphite, Sodium bi-sulphite, Dimethyl sulphide, Thiourea, Zinc and acetic acid are known. Catalytic hydrogenation of the ozonide for the preparation of Hemiacetal is also reported. These are described in the following patents:<br>
US 5,276,167 (EP 541,446), US 4,837, 341(EP 277, 052), US 4,769,478 (EP 23,454), US 4,132, 717, US 4, 409, 398, FR 1, 580,474 and IN 155, 125 read with an article published by the same authors in Tetrahedron, Volume 49, 1989, p-767-774.<br>
Indian Patent No. 155, 125 read with an article published by the same authors in Tetrahedron, Volume 49, 1989, p-767-774, reports a yield of 57.8% of Hemiacetal, in addition to a side product, namely the methyl ester of 3-Formyl-2, 2-dimethyl cyclopropane carboxylic acid, of structural formula III, in 25.2% yield. The real<br>
disadvantage in the Indian patent No. 155,125, read with an article published by the same authors in Tetrahedron, Volume 49, 1989, p-767-774, is the formation of side product methyl ester of 3-Formyl-2, 2-dimethyl cyclopropane carboxylic acid of structural formula III in 25.2% yield. The total yield of Hemiacetal, I, and the side product, III, was 83 % based on C 9 Enol lactone.<br>
We have overcome the above disadvantage by modifying the work -up and isolation techniques.<br>
Hemiacetal can be readily converted into lR-Cis-2, 2-dimethyl-3-(l'-hydroxy-2 ,2',2'- tri bromoethyl) - cyclopropane caorboxylic acid ( Bromoacid) of structural formula IV, which can be ultimately converted into Deltamethrin. These have been shown in our Indian Patent applications Numbers 2228/Del/98, 2227/Del/98, 2262/Del/98 and 3262/Del/98.<br>
The reaction of Hemiacetal with Bromoform in the presence of alcoholic potassium hydroxide and a suitable solvent at -10° C to - 15° C, gives Bromoacid in &gt; 77% yield, in 2 to 3 hours.<br>
However, under similar conditions the methyl ester of 3-Formyl-2,2-dimethyl cyclopropane carboxylic acid of formula III, does not completely react to give the Bromoacid. The yield of Bromoacid is very low ( ~ 25%) and substantial quantity of methyl ester of 3-Formyl-2,2-dimethyl cyclopropane carboxylic acid, remains unreacted. Even at higher temperatures (upto 40°C ) and prolonged reaction time (12 hours) the reaction does not proceed to completion.<br>
Methyl ester of 3-Formyl-2,2-dimethyl cyclopropane carboxylic acid of formula III can be converted into Deltamethrin by first carrying out a Wittig reaction with Bromoform to get the methyl ester of Deltamethric acid and this in turn can be converted into Deltamethrin. However, this process is comparatively very expensive.<br>
It is therefore profitable to either minimize or eliminate the formation of methyl ester of 3-Formyl-2,2-dirnethyl cyclopropane carboxylic acid.<br>
In our improved process, we have reduced the quantities of methanol and DMS, but increased the time of hydrolysis with aqueous oxalic acid solution from 3 to 6 hours at 25- 30 ° C in order to increase the yield of Hemiacetal from 57.8 to 75. 12 % and simultaneously reduce the quantity of the side product III from 25. 2 to 
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of Hemiacetal, 4- Hydroxy-6, 6-dimethyl -3- oxabicyclo [3,1,0] - Hexan -2-one from the Enol-lactone of (-)-lR-cis-2,2-Dimethyl -3-(2'- oxopropyl )- cyclo propane carboxylic acid (C9-Enol lactone) comprising.<br>

Example<br>
C9 Enol lactone ( 59.18 gm, 90.84%, 0.3537 mole) was dissolved in methanol ( 262 ml, moisture content 0.05%). The solution was cooled to -15 °C and ozonized oxygen passed at -15 to -10 °C for 3 hours, until ozonolysis was complete. Nitrogen was purged through the solution to remove traces of dissolved ozone. The solution was added slowly to a pre-cooled solution of Dimethyl sulphide (24 gm, 91%, 0.4243 mole) in methanol (30 ml) during 30 minutes, under stirring. The temperature of the reaction mass was raised to 30 °C and the mass was further<br>

To the residue obtained ( 108 gm) aqueous oxalic acid solution ( 0.5 % , 1240 ml) was added and the mass was stirred at room temperature ( 25 ± 5 C ) for six hours , until the hydrolysis was complete ( TLC, silica gel plate, 20% ethyl acetate-petroleum ether eluent), and the product was extracted with ethyl acetate ( 120 + 60 + 60 ml) . Solvent was stripped off at 50 to 55 ° C/ 200 to 10mm Hg, (recovery of ethyl acetate 200 ml) to yield 50 gms of a crude Hemiacetal which was purified by crystalization from acetone - petroleum ether mixture (48 gm, 1:1 w/w ) to get pure Hemiacetal ( 38 .5 gm, mp: 111- 112 ° C, yield 75. 12% )<br>
