Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a protective structure and ,in particular, to a protective structure adapted to protect beach settlements such as beach village, fishermen communities and beach resorts from high rising tidal waves, such as, Tsunami and the like. Importantly, the protective structure of the invention can serve as a simple and cost effective provision to take care of the problems of beach settlements in tackling tidal waves, especially high rising tidal waves and provide for a safe and convenient to use protective structure which can be easily obtained and readily installed in beach locations. The protective system of the Invention is adapted to protect against tidal waves and is also developed keeping in view the need to maintain the natural and environmental beauty of sea beaches and the like which are subject to such tidal destruction. The protective system can also favor as provision for comfortable sitting and viewing of the sea and possibly also serve as implement for children / kids to play such as by way of its adaptability as a children slide. The protective structure can be obtained In forms such as huge seashells or many other aesthetic and artistic forms to add beauty to the beach location.<br>
Background Art<br>
It is well known that tidal waves especially high rising tidal waves are a matter of regular concern to beach settlements such as beach villages, fishermen communities and beach resorts due to the huge detection to life and material and consequential hazards related to such beach settlements..Tldal waves at times can attain dangerous proportion and It is very difficult to predict when such destructive waves can lash against the coastal / beach settlements and locations. Moreover, apart from the regular hazards of such tidal waves, the high rising tidal waves such as those generated by Tsunamis are totally unpredictable and hence Is a constant source of worry to beach settlements.<br><br>
Importantly, while beach settlements need protection against such hazards of high rising tidal waves, it is also Important to ensure that provision of such protective structures / measures do not affect the natural beauty, given the natural sea view and landscape of such coastal / beach resorts for which such locations are famous especially to the tourists. Therefore, high rising tidal waves such as Tsunamis the occurrence of which Is difficult to predict and can take place after gap of time may be years or decades, any structure made to protect beach settlement against such tidal waves should not be Inconvenient to the public day to day access / viewing from sea beaches and enjoying of its natural beauty. Therefore, If a wall is made in front of the beach as a protective means, considering that its purpose would be to protect the beach against Tsunami or high tidal waves the same should be constructed to be high of sufficient height and continuous almost like a fort to withstand the high tidal Tsunami ,At such height and to withstand such force It should also essentially be thick with deep strong foundation for secured damage free two dimensional structure. While it is obvious that building such a structure would be both laborious and cost extensive, even otherwise, such a structure would not be suitable since It would seriously affect the natural environmental attraction of such locations. It is also obvious that a wall put along the sea beach would not only obstruct the sea view but also obstruct the sea breeze, thereby, affecting seriously the natural beauty or the attraction of such places, especially to the tourists.<br>
It is also known to protect the beach settlements against tidal waves by provision of early warning systems to inform the beach settlers about sub oceanic quakes, which can cause Tsunami. However, such early warning systems are also found to be problematic and unreliable as the same are subject to some false alarm / sirens<br><br>
which unnecessarily disturb the regular activities and lifestyle of such beach settlements. The sub oceanic sensors are placed along the fault zones of subduction zones where the sub oceanic quakes usually happen. Moreover, while such alarm systems or early warning systems can rise an alarm that an earth quake can happen it can never precisely predict at which shore line and at what time the tidal waves such as Tsunami will strike.<br>
Also, it is known from studies on Tsunami that the Tsunami life span is like an innocent baby to a monster adult. Since Tsunami originates as a result of sub oceanic quakes at the subduction zones, the baby Tsunami born in such region is quite and calm such that It is not even felt by ships in and around such region, but as the Tsunami crawls towards the shore it grows to a monster. Therefore, there is a natural lifespan of Tsunami from its origin to destructive worst phase which can be taken as Tsunami Mama (Mother natures) warning to her children that the monster attack Is on the way which is popularly known as sea recession. Thus by way of such natural warning system mother nature also serves to Indicate sometimes hours before of a tidal wave like Tsunami strike.<br>
Thus, while there may be possible natural early warning systems to Indicate high tidal wave like Tsunami attack through pre-attack sings or warnings which can help to save Some lives but such warning signals are of no use as far as the destruction and damage caused to properties and material belongings of beach settlers / tourists. Such loss of property make survival of people who are saved of their lives more difficult leading to serious possible mental and psychological sufferings apart from physical discomfort. Moreover, such early warning signals when sounded lead to chaotic conditions which again add to the further complexities in situations of such tidal waves resulting in destruaion / damages.<br><br>
It is thus important to not only provide for possible early warning system against such high rising tidal waves such as, Tsunami but also ensure by way of some protective system the safety of life and material along beach settlements against such tidal waves. More importantly, the protective system should also be such that it does not affect the natural   beauty and view of such coastal / beach locations and maintain Its natural sanctity and environmental attraction, especially to the tourists.<br>
Oblects of the Invention<br>
It Is the thus the basic object of the present invention to provide for a protective structure / system which would be simple and convenient to install and which would enable effective protection of beach settlements such as beach villages, fishermen communities and beach resorts from high rising tidal waves, such as, those experienced during Tsunami and the tike.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide for a protective structure/ system which can be Installed In beaches and along coastal regions to protect against high rising tidal waves such as Tsunami which would also favour maintaining the natural sanctity, view of such coastal / beach locations and continue to maintain the much desired tourist attraction to travel to such locations.<br>
Yet another object of the present Invention is to provide for a protective system / strcture which could withstand forces of high tidal waves such as, Tsunami and yet would not require thick and deep strong foundation, such as wall like view obstructing structures and would  therefore, be simple and cost effective to obtain and on the other hand would be effective In tackling or withstanding Tsunamic height and force.<br><br>
Yet another object of the present Invention is to provide for a protective structure / system to protect beach settlements which can be selectively and advantageously disposed in spaced apart locations along the sea beach / coastal locations and built to add aesthetic value and purpose in locations such as those involving scenic beauty and purposes of beaches and coastal regions.<br>
Yet another object of the present Invention is to provide for a simple and protective stmcture / systems which would act against high tidal waves such as Tsunami and the like and can also be obtained fn a manner which would fawnir tourists by way of providing for sitting provisions on beaches and even as implements for playing of children such as children slides and thereby value add to the attraction of such beaches / coastal regions and at the same time take care of protecting the life and property of beach settlements.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide for a Tsunami prewarning system by way of provision of appropriate audio and visual sensors, which can set off atam , from atop the Tsunami protective structure, in the event of formation of a Tsunami.<br>
Summary off the Invention<br>
Thus basic of the present invention there is provided a protective structure adapted to protect beach settlements against tidal waves such as Tsunami and the like comprising:<br>
A compartmented protective structure having a wider top and a narrowed down rear lower portion adapted for forceful flushing down of water from the top to the lowest compartment at the base.<br><br>
Preferably, the compartmented protective structure comprises of a top head compartment, a neck compartment, a middle compartment and a base compartment , said head ,neck and middle compartments inter connected at the rear part with the base compartment.<br>
In accordance with a preferred aspect of the invention the said head compartment has a projected front with respect to the base constituting a cantilever type projectlon/shade/support.<br>
The said base comprises an outward slope adapted to force the in coming water back to the sea.The said base portion facing the ground/beach Is provided with means for swinging action such as a shaped configuration adapted for a swinging action.<br>
The said base portion facing the ground/beach Is further shaped complimentary to the top cantilever type projectlon/shade/support such as to provide flexiblltty and stability to the structure. Additionally, the said base Is further provided with anchorage means to secure with respect to the sand and impart extra stability to the structure.<br>
In accordance with yet another aspect of the present invention the said middle part of the structure is preferably adapted as a seating region with said neck and head regions acting as cantilever type shade for the person seated in the middle region.It is also possible that the said back of the structure comprise a slanted/angled surface preferably as children slide.<br>
While the protective structure can be of any suitable sizes depending upon its end use/application, preferably the same can comprising of a height of preferably about 15 feet, width preferably of 10 feet In the front/top and 3 feet In the rear/lower<br>
region.<br><br>
The height of the structure gradually slopes towards the towards the rear.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the present Invention there Is provided a system of protective structures adapted to protect beach settlements against tidal waves such as Tsunami and the like comprising selectively disposed plurality of protective structures as herein descrlt)ed in appropriate gaps along the beach such as to nullify the destructive force of the tidal wave.<br>
In accordance with yet another aspect of the present invention there Is provided a method for protecting beach settlements against tidal waves such as Tsunami arxl the tike comprising the step of selectively disposing plurality of protective structures such as herein descrll)ed in appropriate gaps along the beach such as to nullify the destructive force of the tidal<br>
It ts thus possible by way of the afore discussed protective structure / system to favour protecting beach settlements such as beach villages, fishermen communities and beach resorts from high rising tidal waves by partial accommodation of water and cutting through the wavelength, height and force.<br>
In accordance with preferred aspect, the topmost of the protective structure / system can be as high as IS', the width of the structure can be 10' In the front reducing to almost 3' In the rear part. It Is ,however, possible to selectively provide for protective structure of varying dimensions such as to obtain giant or mini protective structures depending upon the requirement of the locations where such structure need to be installed.<br>
Advantageously, the protective structure of the Invention can also be adapted such that the same can also serve as a sitting provision for tourists along beaches with possible cantilever type projecting sheets of the top.<br><br>
The protective / systems by way of its compartmented construction and shape and configuration Is adapted to withstand high tidal wave forces even as high as those generated by Tsunami. The functional advantages of the protective structure / system take care of cutting through the length height and force of such tidal lase. In particular, as the Tsunami or tidal wave approaches the beach provided with such protective structure / systems the water enters the protective structures, more particularly, the compartmented regions facing the sea. This Initial action of water entering the compartmented regions of the protective system / structure is adapted to create a major cut through the wave length, height and force. The selective disposition in spaced apart manner of piurality of such protective structure / systems along the beach help to totally nullify the destructive forces of Tsunami.<br>
The narrower tower rear part of the protective structure is selectively provided for a forceful slashing down of water to the lowest compartment base. This is achieved by way of interconnection there between the head, neck and middle compartments at the inner rear part with the base.<br>
Advantageously, the base Is provided with an outward sk&gt;pe to lead the Incoming water back to the sea. The base is also provided with a selective shape at the ground contact In order to create a swinging action for the protective structure / system. Such a shape of the base is preferably a complementary shape to the top front cantilever form of the protective structure, which make tlie structure totally Hexlble and stable to withstand even the power of Tsunami at Itt extreme.<br>
The base Is also provided with anchorage means such anchorage foots adapted to penetrate into the sand with appropriate angle to thereby impart additional stablltty to the protective structure.<br><br>
In accordance with another aspect of the invention, adequate number of solar cells provided on top of the protective structure will provideself sufficient energy for the sensors positioned on the protective structure in order to sense the Impending danger of a Tsunami, if the situation warrants. LED'S provided on the protective structure can blink, provide light and ensure aesthetic appearance of the proteaive structure during nights. Sensors, both audio and visual provide on the head of the protective structure at the crown can set off alarm, which Is also provided on the top of the head at the crown, in the event of a recession In the water at the seashore.<br>
The detail of the Invention, Its objects and advantages are explained hereunder In greater detail In relation to non-limiting exemplary illustration of the protective structure / system of the Invention.<br>
In the accompanying figures:<br>
Figure 1:     Illustrates the front view of the protective structure / system to protect against high rising tidal waves of the present Invention.<br>
Figure 2:     is a side perspective view of the protecthra system of figure 1<br>
Figure 3 :     Is a back view of the protective strucUjre of Figure 1<br>
Rgure 4 :     Is a perspective view of the protective structure of Figure 1<br>
Figure 5 :   is a view of the base compartment of the protective system of the invention<br><br>
Figure 6 :   is further embodiment of the protective structure in accordance with the Invention.<br>
Reference is first invited to Figures 1 and 2 that illustrate the construction of the protective structure to protect against high rising tidal waves in accordance with present Invention. As shown In said figures, the protective structure comprises of compartmented regions adapted to face the tidal waves comprising head compartment (1), neck compartment (2), middle compartment ( 3) and a base compartment (4). As the tidal wave approaches and lashes against the protective structure, water enters the compartmented regions and creates a major cut to the wavelength, height and force of the ttdal waves. Since the protective structures are maintained spaced apart along the beach such multiple protective structure help In nullifying the destructive force of Tsunami. As also apparent from the figures the protective structure can comprise of the height of about IS', width of 10' In the front portion and reducing to almost 3' In the rear part. There is thus gradual narrowing of the structure from the top to Its lower part. Such narrow, lower rear part of the protective system provides a forceful flushing down of water to the lowest compartment, the base (4). Such flushing down of the water Is possible by way of the interconnection of the head, neck and middle compartment at the Inner rear part with the base.<br>
As ftirther apparent from accompanying figures, the head portion Is provided with a projection (5), which can fav(xir to serve as a cantilever type shade. It is also possible to adapt the middle compartment (3) as a bench /sitting provision for visitors / tourist to sit while the neck (2)and head (1) regions are adapted to form a cantilever shade for the middle portlon(3} which can then serve as a sunshade or protective cover on top of the person sitting In the middle compartment.<br><br>
Reference is now invited to accompanying Figure 3 and 4 and which illustrate the possible adaptability of the protective system rear portion (6) to act as a slide such as a children slide for the kids to play while the parents are relaxing In the front beach.<br>
Reference is now Invited to accompanying Figure 5 which illustrate the configuration of the base compartment (4).As shown In said figure the base (4A) Is provided with an outward slope to lead the Incoming water back to the sea.The base is also given a selective shape {4B) at the ground contact In order to create a swing action for the protective structure. This is a complimentary shape to the top front cantilever form of the protective structure which make It totally flexible and stable structure to overcome the extreme tidal forces of Tsunaml. Furthermore the base (s also provided with anchor foots (4C) adapted to penetrate Into the sand with appropriate angle to thereby provide extra stability to the structure.<br>
It would be apparent from the above that based on the above basic constructional features of ttte protective system adapted to cut through the wave length, height and force of tidal waves^ It is pc^slble to provide such protective structure as huge sea shells or any other aesthetic and artistic form to value add to the beauty of coastal / beach locations. Importantly, the protective system while provMIng forthe much required protection against tidal wave being of selective attractive narrow lower rear part construction will ^vour clear sea view at nonnat tHonan height and would therefore ensure muiintenance of natural beauty and sea view of such coastal / beach locations. The protective system would therefore serve as a simple onA cost effective means to protect beach settlements against unknown hazards of tidal waves and will also be adapted to value add to the natural beauty and environmental attraction of beaches and like locations.<br><br><br>
