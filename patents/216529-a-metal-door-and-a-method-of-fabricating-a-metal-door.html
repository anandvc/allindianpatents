DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Turning first to Figure 1, a door embodying the present invention has a unitary rectangular frame 2 with a pair of substantially rectangular panels 5 secured thereto and a core 3 of cellular synthetic resin filling the cavity.<br>
As best seen in Figure 8, the frame 2 is a continuous unitary metallic member of generally uniform cross section which includes a pair of parallel stiles 4 and upper and lower rails 6. Preferably, the ends of the frame 2 are joined in the middle of lower rail 6 as seen in Figures 15-17,<br>
As best seen in Figures 4-7, the frame cross section includes a planar central portion 31, a pair of flanking marginal portions 33 which are inwardly offset from the plane of central portion 31, and a pair of channels 35 between the Marginal portions 33 and central portion 31. The marginal portions 33 have inwardly directed flanges or tail portions 37 along their outer edges and distal segments 34 on the ends of the tail portions 37 extend inwardly at an angle of about 17,5° to the body of the tail portion. It is to be noted that the frame member cross section is generally symmetrical along its length. As illustrated in the drawings, various recesses and openings are provided at appropriate locations on the stiles 4 for the attachment of hinges (not shown) and a lockset and/or dead bolt (not shown). As seen in Figures 5, 10, 11, 16 and 17, the metal of the strip may be punched to provide dimples which will seat the fasteners (not shown) for securing the hinges and lockets. Figures 12-14 show the lockset area with an embossed recess 20.   An opening may also be formed in a rail 6 for the insertion of a foamable resin to provide the core 3 hereinafter described. All of these recesses and openings are in central portion 31 of the frame element.<br>
As best seen in Figure 19, the metallic panel 5 is generally planar and rectangular, and it may have an embossed face 8 as seen therein. As seen in Figures 4<br>
and 5, the edges of the longer sides of the panel 5, i.e., the sides Which will be vertical when the door is Installed, have flanges 10 extending at a right angle to the plane of the<br>
face 8 of the panel 5 and these seat in the channels 35 of the stiles 4.  As also seen, the ends of the flanges 10 have reversely and inwardly bent segments 12 which deflect when the flanges 10 are inserted into the channels 35. This produces a snap fit and fractional engagement with the sidewalls of the channels 35 to secure the panisls 5 on the frame 2. The edges of the shorter side of panels 5, i.e., the sides which will be horizontal when the door is installed also have flanges 16 which extend at a right angle to the face and these seat on the surface of the marginal portions 33 of the upper and lower rails 6 of the frame 2 and sierve both to prevent the panels 5 from sliding verically on the frame 2 and to prevent deformation of the door from its desired rectangular configuration.<br>
Backing blocks 7 of wood or plastic may be placed within the door frame 2 to support a lockset (not shown) and to provide backing for the attachment of hinges or other items such as emergency closures and handles (not shown) in a conventional manner. The remainder of the space bounded by the frame 2 and panels 5 is filled with a cellular synthetic resin core 3. If the core 3 is provided by introducing beads or pellets which are expanded or in place by heat, the expanding material of the core 3 extends between and engages the tail portions 27 and the inwardly projecting distal segments 12 of the frame 2, further serving to strengthen and rigidify door 1 as well as to provide insulation therebetween.  The 17.5o inward inclination of the distal segments 37 has been found to maximize this engagement.<br>
As diagtammatically illustrated in Figure 22, the frame 3 of the door may be formed in a single piece from a coil of metal strip of suitable thickness and width. The strip is first prenotched and prepunched and then roll formed into the desired cross section. The roll, formed strip is next embossed with the desired recesses and notched, and finally cut into desired lengths. These lengths are bent at the notches which are located at the comers to form the desired rectangular shape.<br>
The ends of the frame element are then fastened together to complete the frame 2. As seen in Figures 15-17, the ends 18 of the length of strip providing the frame 2 may overlap and be secured by clenching or staking (not shown) or by any other suitable means such as the insertion of a tongue into a slot, welding, rivets, etc.<br>
To assure optimum engagement between the frame 2 and the panels 5, the width of channels 35 is greater than twice the thickness of the panels 5 so that the angularly oriented segments 12 snap fit therein and be retained therein.<br>
This assembly of the panels 5 to the frame 2 begins with the positioning of a first panel 5 on an assembly table with the flanges 10, and top flange l6 extending upwardly. The frame 2 is placed atop the prepositioned panel 5 and pressed downwardly, causing the channel flanges 10 to enter into the channels 35 and deflect the segments 12 which the snap fit and frictionally engage the channel walls. The top and bottom edges have perpendicular flanges 33 which snugly fit over the rails 6.<br>
A second panel 5 is now placed on the frame 2 and pressed downwardly into engagement therewith in the same fashion. In one embodiment, the bottom portions of both panels 5 may be bent to provide the bottom flanges 16 which extend over the surface of the bottom rail 6 to lock the assembly in a squared condition.<br>
Lastly, the cellular synthetic resin core 3 may be provided in a conventional manner by introducing, through an opening in the frame, a foamable fluid synthetic resin into the cavity and foaming it in place or by inserting prefoamed plastic beads into the door interior through an opening previously formed in the frame 3 and applying heat to cause the beads to expand. Alternatively, the core 3 may be produced by an open pour process in Which the resin is introduced before the top panel is: placed thereon and the top panel placed thereon, after which the resin cures fully.<br>
Thus, it can be seen from the foregoing detailed specification and attached drawings that the metal door of the present invention is readily and easily fabricated with a minimum of assembly labor and steps. The continuous frame eliminates many of the problems encountered by assembling separate stiles and rails.<br><br><br><br>
