WATER HEATERS IN BEVERAGE DISPENSING MACHINES"<br>
The present invention relates to a method and an apparatus for treating linnescale deposits within water heaters in beverage dispensing machines.<br>
Water heaters are l<nown to be subject limescale build-up on the surfaces which contact water. in fact heating water leads ionization of dissolved salts and these tend deposit a layer surface heater. causes formation hard deposits are difficult remove detrimental operation heater associated ducts. such reduce efficiency thermal exchange between hot thereby causing waste energy. moreover excessive may cause ducts obstructed.></nown>
Different apparatuses have been provided for reducing, by way of vibrations, the limescale build-up within water heaters, such as boilers, flash-heaters, etc..<br>
EP-A-1378194, in the name of "Fianara International B.V.", discloses an apparatus for preventing the limescale deposits within the water heater of a beverage dispensing machine. The apparatus is provided with on ultrasound transmitter and an ultrasound receiver, such as piezo-electric transducers, directly or indirectly coupled to the water heater. The ultrasound transmitter is powered during all the operation time of the beverage dispensing machine to generate oscillations which are transmitted to the heater body and then picked up by the receiver. An amplifier amplifies the oscillations and, without altering the phase, feeds back the oscillations to the transmitter, through the<br><br>
water heater to oscillate at its natural frequency, thereby avoiding the limescale build-up over the heater surfaces. The apparatus provides low power of piezo-electric transducers, included in the range fronn 100 mW to 250 nnW, for long time.<br>
The apparatus according to EP-A-1378194 requires an amplifier to be provided with an ultrasound receiver and the related circuitry, this leading to a complicated assembly and high production and maintenance costs. Setting up the circuitry can be complicated. The amplifier and the circuitry need to be cooled, especially if located next to the water heater, this requiring a particular attention during installation of the apparatus.<br>
Moreover if the piezo-electric transducers are made of a ceramic material, they must be thermally isolated from the water heater. In fact, when the temperature of the transducers exceeds the Curie temperature of the ceramic material, the transducers cease to operate. Thus an insulating material must be provided between each transducer and the water heater. Such insulating material should promote sound transmission in order to allow propagation of the oscillations.<br>
GB-A-2227254, in the name of "Instants Limited", refers to a method and the related apparatus for removing, or preventing, the formation of limescale deposits within a water heater. Water is oscillated at high frequencies by inducing ultrasonic vibrations, for instance by way of a piezo-electric device, in the range of 20 kHz to 100 kHz. Vibrations, which are transmitted to the water heater, are generated continuously to avoid a limescale build-up or to remove the deposits. Known methods and apparatuses for removing or preventing limescale build-up within water heaters have several drawbacks.<br>
3<br><br>
occur in troublesome noise generation. Moreover the water heater must be expressly designed to sustain the mechanical stresses which are maximized, in that the oscillations are at the heater natural frequency. Heaters normally utilized within beverage dispensing machines have a simple design and are unexpensive. Weldings, fittings, couplings, etc., between heater parts may fail under uninterrupted vibrations. A design of the water heater which takes into account such risks easily leads to an increase of production costs. Causing the water heater to continuously vibrate, for long time, at high frequencies may also result in mechanical failures. Moreover such a solution is power consuming.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to overcome the drawbacks of known solutions by providing a method and an apparatus for removing the limescale deposits within the water heater of a beverage dispensing machine which is easy to implement, effective and power saving.<br>
This and other objects are achieved by the method according to the present invention as set forth in claim 1.<br>
Advantageously the method provides the step of discontinuously inducing high energy ultrasonic vibrations within the water heater to achieve detachment of limescale deposits from the heater surfaces. "Discontinuously" means at discrete time intervals, which are relatively short with respect to the time the machine is powered, and not continuously, as required by known solutions. The number of time intervals of activation is within the range of 1 to 10, depending on the duration of each time interval. The total time of activation preferably is within the range of 15 to 40 minutes and preferably not longer than 30 minutes. This allows for an evident power saving. Duration of the time<br>
4<br><br>
minutes and can be empirically set to a proper value in order to effectively achieve removal, or desired substantial reduction, of limescale deposits within the v/ater heater.<br>
The applicant has found that effective treatment of limescale deposits vv'ithin a 20 litres heater can be achieved by inducing high energy oscillations within the heater body for short time intervals, i.e. of less than 20 minutes, thereby reducing power consumption and noise generation with respect to prior art solutions.<br>
Preferably, frequency of the oscillations is different from the natural frequency of the water heater, this minimizing the risks of submitting the same water heater to destructive mechanical stresses or generating noise.<br>
The ultrasonic oscillations can be generated by powering at least one piezo-electric transducer directly or indirectly coupled to the heater. For instance the piezo-electric transducer can be attached to a wall of the water heater to directly transmit vibrations to its surfaces. Alternatively the transducer can be submersed in the water contained within the heater. By inducing vibrations of the water, also the heater body vibrates. Proper electrical insulation of the transducer must be provided to avoid current flow through the water. The method according to the present invention is particularly suitable for treating limescale deposits within the water heater of beverage dispensing machines, for instance nnachines which deliver coffee, tea, cappuccino, chocolate or any hot drink.<br>
The step of inducing ultrasonic vibrations is preferably carried out once a day, at the shut-down or at the s-tart-up of the same machine, or more times per day. This can be accomplished simply by powering the piezo-electric transducer for a preset time interval, preferably<br><br>
Suitable frequencies for such application are included in the range from 20 kHz to 100 kHz, preferably in the range from 25 kHz to 35 kHz. By inducing vibrations at 30 kHz in a typical water heater of a beverage dispensing machine limescale deposits can be removed, or drastically reduced, in less than 30 minutes, normally in 15 minutes. Duration of the time interval(s) for inducing vibrations vv/ithin the water heater can be set to a total of 30 minutes per day. One or more cleaning steps can be accomplished by implementing the method of the invention to achieve the desired reduction of the limescale build¬up, thereby maintaining the efficiency of the heater and the related beverage dispensing machine.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, vibrations are induced by scanning the frequencies included within the range 20 kHz to 100 kHz. Scanning of the frequencies, i.e. inducing vibrations at different frequencies during operation of the piezo-electric transducer, may be carried out in several ways.<br>
For instance the piezo-electric transducer may be powered to vibrate the water heater at a frequency which increases or decreases as an analog quantity in the aforesaid range. This can be achieved by powering the piezo-electric transducer at continuously increasing/decreasing voltages.<br>
As alternative, the piezo-electric transducer may be powered to vibrate the water heater at frequencies which increase or decrease as a train of impulses, each impulse being at a given frequency. For instance the transducer is firstly powered at 20 kHz for five seconds, then at 30 kHz for the following five seconds, then at 40 kHz for the following ten seconds, etc.. This can be achieved by powering the piezo-electric   transducer  at  discontinuously  increasing/decreasing<br>
6<br><br>
The present invention also relates to an apparatus for rennoving, or reducing, the limescale deposits within a water heater as set forth in claim 11.<br>
A suitable device for inducing ultrasonic vibrations may comprise one or more piezo-electric transducers. For a typical coffee machine water heater, a single ceramic piezo-electric transducer can be utilized in the shape of a disc having a diameter of about 40 mm and height of about 5 mm; in order to reach the required oscillations amplitude, i.e. to provide high energy oscillations, the transducer is powered with 100 to 200 Volts. The disc is attached to the lateral wall of the heater and is controlled to implement the aforesaid method.<br>
In order to induce high energy oscillations within the heater body, the piezo-electric transducer power is about 2 Watts, i.e. at least 10 times higher than the power provided by the apparatuses according to prior art. Generally, the piezo-electric transducer power is included in the range from 100 mW to 5 W. According to the present invention, such high energy oscillations are induced for short time intervals, preferably when the beverage dispensing machine is in stand-by or non operative.<br>
The method and the apparatus of the present invention can be advantageously applied to clean the mixing chambers normally provided within the beverage dispensing machines. Ingredients such as water and milk powder, water and cocoa powder, etc., are mixed by a mixer rotating in the chamber. Residues may build up on the surfaces which cause hygienical problems. Oscillations can be induced to the chamber instead of the heater, in order to detach such alimentary residues from the chamber surfaces and the mixer to provide an effective cleaning process.<br>

Figure 1 shows a flow chart of the method according to the present invention for removing, or reducing, the limescale deposits within a water heater of a beverage dispensing machine. The method comprises the step of inducing high energy ultrasonic vibrations to the water heater by powering an ultrasonic generator directly or indirectly coupled to the same heater. For instance, the water heater supplies hot water to a beverage dispensing machine for preparing coffee, chocolate, cappuccino, tea, etc..<br>
Differently from the method disclosed in prior art, in the present invention the ultrasonic vibrations are induced discontinuously, at short discrete time intervals. Preferably oscillations are at a frequency different from the natural frequency of the water heater. Resonance<br>
8<br><br>
figure 1 the step of evaluating the natural frequency of the heater is optional.<br>
Vibrations are induced discontinuously, i.e. at discrete time intervals, not continuously, to minimize energy consumption. For instance the ultrasonic generator can be powered once a day, during the start-up or the shut-down of the heater or the related machine, for a preset time interval. Alternatively, the ultrasonic generator can be powered at regular time intervals and for example for up to 30 minutes. In other words, the step of inducing ultrasonic vibrations to the water heater can be carried out once a day, more times per day, every hour, every 30 minutes, etc., independently upon water consumption or it can be carried out upon heating a preset volume of water, for instance every time 20 litres have been heated.<br>
The natural frequency of the heater is known per se. For example producers of beverage dispensing machine can evaluate experimentally the value of the natural frequency, thereby setting a different frequency for the oscillations of the ultrasonic generator. Alternatively, the method may comprise the step of sensing the amplitude of the heater oscillations when the ultrasonic generator is powered. If the value of such amplitude is close to the value of the amplitude of the oscillations at the natural frequency, or is considered to cause excessive stress of the heater weldings, couplings, etc., then the frequency of the induced vibrations is changed. By inducing vibrations at frequencies different form the natural frequency of the heater, mechanical stresses are minimized, as well as the noise produced by the vibrating surfaces of the heater 5. As shown in the flow chart of figure 2, when the frequency of the induced vibrations is changed, the duration of the time interval is<br>
9<br><br>
generator is powered at low frequencies, for instance in the range of 20 to 25 IcHz, duration of each time interval for inducing vibrations is maximized, being for instance in the range from 20 to 30 minutes. When the ultrasonic generator is powered at high frequencies, for instance in the range from 35 to 100 kHz, duration of each time interval for inducing vibrations is minimized, being for instance in the range from 1 to 10 minutes. The same principle applies for what concerns the power, which is included in the range from 100 mW to 5 W. When the frequency of the induced vibrations is about the natural frequency of the heater, the power is controlled to be minimized. The ultrasonic generator can be powered in such a way to scan all the frequencies included in the range 20 kHz to 100 kHz, as it will be explained later. Frequencies supplied to the ultrasonic generator affect frequencies of the oscillations induced within the water heater body. In other words, the frequency of the oscillations can change during the aforesaid time interval. If the natural frequency of the heater is included in the scanned range, such frequency is rapidly trespassed to avoid resonance, thereby minimizing noise produced by vibrating surfaces of the heater 5. The natural frequency data is obtained from the producer or by tests.<br>
The method of the present invention can be advantageously applied to machines for preparing and dispensing hot beverages, such as coffee, chocolate, tea, cappuccino, etc.. Substantially removing, or reducing, limescale deposits from the water heater of such machines allows for keeping the efficiency of the thermal exchange, with evident advantages for what concerns the operation of the machines and the power saving. The method of the present invention, as shown in the flow chart of<br><br>
warming water, or the related beverage dispensing macliine is not dispensing a drink. In other words, when the machine is not dispensing a beverage, being for \ns\ance in stand-by, or the water heater is not powered, the same water heater undergoes a descaling and cleaning step by carrying out the method of the invention. This can be done when the beverage dispensing machine is turned on, or when it is turned off. Alternatively it can be done at preset time intervals during the operating time.<br>
An apparatus 1 according to the present invention is schematically shown in figure 4, wherein the water heater is known per se. The heater can be a flash-heater, a tube boiler, etc.. The apparatus 1 comprises an ultrasonic generator 2 connected to a power unit 3. A control unit 4 manages operation of the ultrasonic generator 2 and the power unit 3. The ultrasonic generator 2 is shown attached to a wall of the water heater 5 of a beverage dispensing machine (not shown) to induce vibrations within such heater 5. The generator 2 can be glued, welded, or jointly fixed to the heater body. Alternatively the ultrasonic generator 2 can be submersed in the water (electrically insulated) contained within the heater 5 to induce vibrations in the water, thereby vibrating also the heater 5.<br>
The water heater is known per se, defining a volume for the water to be heated and to be supplied for preparation of a beverage. For instance water is supplied within the heater through an intake conduit 7 from an external source. Hot water is delivered though the conduit 6 for processing. An heat source 8 is provided, typically an electric heating member.<br>
Alternatively a flash heater can be used. Differently from the aforesaid heater, wherein a volume of water is collected and heated, flash<br><br>
through passages, pipes, labyrinths, or similar tlow constrictions. Heating the water promotes deposition of dissolved salts in a layer on the internal surfaces of the heater 5. The layer of limescale which builds up is detrimental to the operation of the heating member 8 and downstream devices of the beverage dispensing machine such as the outlet pipe 6. In particular the deposition of limescale reduces the efficiency of the heating member 8. This problem can be overcome by inducing vibrations through the generator 2, allowing for detachment of the deposits from the heater 5 surfaces. Preferably the ultrasonic generator is a piezo-electric transducer which can operate at frequencies included in the range from 20 kHz to 100 kHz. A suitable generator is a circular ceramic piezo-electric transducer having a diameter of about 40 mm and height of about 5 mm.<br>
A suitable transducer is available by "PI Ceramic GmbH", coded PRYY-0980, made of a material designated PIC 181 and classified "100" in accordance with the standard EN 50324-1, and "I" in accordance with the standard DOD-STD-1376A. Such transducer has a Curie temperature of about SSOX. Since typical heaters of the beverage dispensing machine run at temperatures below 150°C, the aforesaid transducer can be applied to the heater with no need for thermal insulation. In other words the transducer designated PIC 181 can sustain high temperatures, thereby allowing for any insulating material not to be interposed between the same transducer and the heater, this maximizing transmission of the oscillations.<br>
It has been found that, for effectively removing or reducing limescale deposits within the water heater of a common beverage dispensing machine, a suitable range for the frequency of the induced vibrations<br>
12<br><br>
mW to 20 W. Limescale detached from the heater 5 surfaces can be<br>
expelled in conventional way, for example by filtering the water<br>
supplied through conduit 6.<br>
Preferably the ceramic piezo-electric transducer is powered at 2 (two)<br>
Watts, this promoting generation of high energy oscillations within the<br>
heater body.<br>
The power unit 3 can be an external power source, for instance<br>
providing from 150 Volts to 200 Volts. Alternatively the power unit 3 is<br>
the beverage machine power unit, for instance a transformer.<br>
The unit 4 controls operation of the piezo-electric transducer 2. A<br>
suitable electrical scheme of the control unit 4 is shown in figure 5. It is<br>
simpler than the circuitry which has to be provided for the apparatus<br>
according to EP-A-1378194. No amplifier is provided, neither a second<br>
transducer working as a receiver.<br>
The powering unit provides 24 Volts DC. A bridge D2 corrects the<br>
alternate  voltage  at  the  connector  CON4.  A transformer  unit  is<br>
provided for switching voltage by the integrated circuit U5 from 24 V<br>
to 240 V. Frequency of the alternate voltage is given by the clock<br>
signal CLOCKULTRA. Signal ENABLE triggers the activation/shut-down<br>
of the control unit 4.<br>
Control unit 4 triggers powering of the transducer 2 according to the<br>
method of the present invention, i.e. at given time intervals and<br>
frequencies different from the natural frequency of the water heater 5.<br>
Powers are preferably greater than the ones known from the prior art.<br>
For instance  the  transducer  2  is  powered  at five   (5)   Watts for<br>
promoting generation of high energy oscillations.<br>
The natural frequency of the heater 5 can be ascertained by the<br>
manufacturer of the beverage dispensing machine. Thus the value of<br><br>
control unit 4 to activate the transducer 2 at different frequencies. The time intervals can be adjusted by the control unit 4 depending on the frequency of the vibrations. When induced frequencies are low, for instance in the range of 20 to 25 kHz, duration of time intervals is at the maximum, for instance in the range from 20 to 30 minutes. When frequencies are higher and more energizing, for instance in the range from 35 to 100 kHz, duration of time intervals is minimized, being for instance in the range from 30 seconds to 10 minutes. The control unit 4 can collect information about the operation of the beverage dispensing machine to trigger the piezo-electric transducer 2 when the machine is in stand-by or non operative. For instance the control unit 4 can determine the most appropriate cleaning frequency depending on variables taken into account, such as water hardness, dispensing throughputs, user's inputs, etc..<br>
The transducer 2, the control unit 4 and the power unit 3 are economic parts available on the market. Thus the apparatus 1 is easy to assemble and not expensive.<br>
With reference to figure 6, it is shown a schematic diagram frequency vs. time relating to possible operating conditions of the apparatus according to the present invention. Provided that powering of the ultrasonic generator is operated discontinuously, as described above, during the operating time lapse the same generator may be powered, as shown in figure 6, to scan all the frequencies comprised within the range 20 kHz to 100 kHz. This can be accomplished by the integrated circuit U5 shown in figure 5 applying a continuously increasing voltage to the piezo-electric transducer 2. The frequencies of the vibrations induced to the water heater 5 increase correspondingly. As shown in the diagram, the function f(t) of the<br><br>
ramp. The time interval is 30 seconds up to 300 seconds (five minutes). It is to be understood that if the natural frequency of the water heater 5 is included in the range to be scanned, such a frequency is skipped, i.e. the integrated circuit U5 is controlled to avoid powering the piezo¬electric transducer 2 at the natural frequency.<br>
Figure 7 relates to a different diagram of the frequency versus time, wherein the function f(t) is a train of separate impulses. Function f(t) is not continuous within the indicated time interval of 60-600 seconds, but is a sort of "step function", whereby the piezo-electric transducer 2 is first powered at 40 kHz for a first time interval of 10 seconds, then is powered at 50 kHz for the following 10 seconds, etc., according to the following scheme:<br>
Frequency [kHz]	time interval [s]<br>
40	60 up to 70 (duration 10)<br>
45	70 up to 80 (duration 10)<br>
55	80 up to 90 (duration 10)<br>
60	90 up to 100 (duration 10)<br>
75	100 up to 300 (duration 200)<br>
80	300   up   to   600   (duration<br>
300). It is to be understood that both functions f(t) shown in figures 6 and 7 may also be decreasing, i.e. starting at the highest frequency and lowering as time lapses.<br>
Scanning of the frequencies allows for effectively detaching limescale deposits within the water heater 5 which may have different thickness or characteristics. In other words, scanning of all frequencies, or several frequencies, within the aforesaid range of 20 kHz up to 100 kHz has found to improve the efficacy of the method according to the<br><br>
most appropriate frequency for promoting its detaching.<br>
Advantageously, the method and the apparatus 1 according to the<br>
present invention allow for the effective removal, or reduction, of<br>
limescale deposits within water heaters, at the same time minimizing<br>
power consumption and noise generation.<br>
After detachment of the limescale deposits from the heater surfaces<br>
has been achieved, detached limescale waste is collected or flushes<br>
out through the water outlet conduits.<br>
The method and the apparatus according to the present invention<br>
can be similarly applied also to clean chambers provided within<br>
beverage dispensing machine for mixing ingredients, such as water<br>
and milk powder or water and cocoa powder. Oscillations induced by<br>
the transducer 2 can be directed to detach residues from the surfaces<br>
of the mixing chamber and the mixer.<br>
Mixing chambers are normally made of a plastic material which can<br>
absorb vibrations generated by the operation of the transducer 2,<br>
thereby reducing efficiency of the apparatus 1. It is preferable to fill<br>
the mixing chamber with water and induce oscillation within the filled<br>
chamber.<br><br><br>
