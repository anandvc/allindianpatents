"SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR DETERRING SOFTWARE PIRACY IN A<br>
VOLUME LICENSE ENVIRONMENT<br>
MICROSOFT CORPORATION, a Corporation of the State of Washington<br>
having a place of business at One Microsoft Way, Redmond, Washington<br>
98052, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the<br>
invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br><br>
SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR DETERRING SOFTWARE PIRACY IN A<br>
VOLUME LICENSE ENVIRONMENT<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to the field of software piracy deterrence and in particular to<br>
the field of volume licensing of software using a volume license key (VLK).<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTÏON<br>
Software piracy is a worldwide problem that costs software vendors huge sums of<br>
money every year. One form of piracy known as casual copying is sharing and installing<br>
software on multiple computers, in violation of the end user license agreement. Product<br>
activation is one way to reduce this type of piracy.<br>
Product activation commonly relies on the submission of an installation<br>
identification code and/or a hardware identifier to the software vendor. The software<br>
vendor in response returns an activation confirmation code. In one type of product<br>
activation, a unique product key is provided with each package of boxed software.<br>
Typically, after some grace period, (a period of time after installation of software during<br>
which the software will run without being activated), a customer must contact the software<br>
vendor to activate his copy of the software. Failure to do so frequently results in<br>
inactivation of the software or in degraded functionality of the software. Typically the<br>
unique product key is used to generate a unique product identification code, which may be<br>
combined with a hashed hardware-related value to generate an installation identification<br>
code that is specifïc to the machine the software runs on. An activation confirmation that<br>
enables the software to run is typically returned to the customer. In this regard, an<br>
activation confirmation can also be a license file, or a binary that represents a license. At<br>
each login the licensed software checks to see that it is running on essentially the same<br>
hardware it was activated on. If the check fails, reactivation is required before the software<br>
will run again.<br>
Corporate customers commonly purchase a volume license. It is not feasible for<br>
corporate customers who may have hundreds or thousands of machines in their domain to<br><br><br><br><br>
-1-<br><br>
contact the software vendor for each software copy installed to receive a machine-specific<br>
activation code. Typically, therefore, holders of volume licenses do not have to contact the<br>
software vendor to activate their software, because the software bypasses the activation<br>
requirement when a volume license key is detected. Hence, the same volume license key<br>
can be used on many different computers, none of which require activation in order for the<br>
software to run, before or after the grace period has expired. This handy feature of the<br>
volume license key makes it an attractive target for piracy.<br>
It would be helpful if there were a way to make pirating of volume license keys<br>
more difficult.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENT1ON<br>
A software-vendor-signed file containing an enterprise-specific VLK, a license ID,<br>
network environment binding hashes, and any policy data is provided to the volume<br>
license holder along with the licensed software. This enterprise-specific license file can be<br>
stored in central servers, such as on an installation server, or it can be stored on the local<br>
machine as well. The enterprise-specific license file can be rather large (e.g.. over l .44 MB<br>
so that the file will not fit on a floppy disk. In one embodiment an unattended installation<br>
script can refer to the enterprise-specific VLK license file or VLK license file can be<br>
deployed after or during install process via some other method (e.g. manual or automated<br>
file copy operation). The script contains the locations of the enterprise-specific license file.<br>
Upon logon, the enterprise-specific license file is read, the data authenticated and the<br>
software is activated. If the software system is not able to verify the license data while<br>
network-connected, the software will continue to be fully functional within a grace period,<br>
beyond which the software will function in reduced functionality mode or the user may<br>
request a signed extension from the software vendor. If the environment binding cannot be<br>
verified while the machine is disconnected from the network, the system will continue to<br>
be functional only with disconnected features until it is re-joined to a network. The grace<br>
period flag is marked in a location unique to each operating system (OS) installation on<br>
which the software is installed. The flag can be validated through the software.<br>
If an enterprise cannot obtain a signed VLK license file from the software vendor,<br>
the enterprise may generate the license file using a software vendor supplied hardware<br>
device, e.g. a smartcard. By generating the license file itself without having to submit<br>
-2-<br><br>
characteristics of its computing environment to the software vendor, the enterprise need<br>
not compromise the security characteristics of its computing environment.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS<br>
Exemplary Computing Environment<br>
FIG. l and the following discussion are intended to pro vide a brief general<br>
description of a suitable computing environment in which the invention may be<br>
implemented. It should be understood, however, that handheld, portable, and other<br>
computing devices of all kinds are contemplated for use in connection with the present<br>
invention. While a general purpose computer is described below, this is but one example,<br>
and the present invention requires only a thin cliënt having network server interoperability<br>
and interaction. Thus, the present invention may be implemented in an environment of<br>
networked hosted services in which very little or minimal cliënt resources are implicated,<br>
e.g., a networked environment in which the cliënt device serves merely as a browser or<br>
interface to the World Wide Web.<br>
Although not required, the invention can be implemented via an application<br>
programrning interface (API), for use by a developer, and/or included within the network<br>
browsing software which will be described in the general context of computer-executable<br>
instructions, such as program modules, being executed by one or more computers, such as<br>
cliënt workstations, servers, or other devices. Generally, program modules include<br>
-3-<br><br>
routines, programs, objects, components, data structures and the üke that perform<br>
particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. Typically, the functionality of<br>
the program modules may be combined or distributed as desired in various embodiments.<br>
Moreover, those skilied in the art will appreciate that the invention may be practiced with<br>
other computer system configurations. Other well known computing systems.<br>
environments, and/or configurations that may be suitable for use with the invention<br>
include, but are not limited to, persona! computers (PCs), automated teller machines,<br>
server computers, hand-held or laptop devices, multi-processor systems, microprocessor-<br>
based systems, programmable consumer electronics, network PCs, minicomputers,<br>
mainframe computers, and the like. The invention may also be practiced in distributed<br>
computing environments where tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are<br>
linked through a Communications network or other data transmission medium. In a<br>
distributed computing environment, program modules may be located in both local and<br>
remote computer storage media including memory storage devices.<br>
FIG. l thus illustrates an example of a suitable computing system environment 100<br>
in which the invention may be implemented, although as made clear above. the computing<br>
system environment 100 is only one example of a suitable computing environment and is<br>
not intended to suggest any limitation as to the scope of use or functionality of the<br>
invention. Neither should the computing environment 100 be interpreted as having any<br>
dependency or requirement relating to any one or combination of components illustrated in<br>
the exemplary operating environment 100.<br>
With reference to FIG. l, an exemplary system for implementing the invention<br>
includes a genera! purpose computing device in the form of a computer 110. Components<br>
of computer 110 may include, but are not limited to, a processing unit 120, a system<br>
memory 130, and a system bus 121 that couples various system components including the<br>
system memory to the processing unit 120. The system bus 121 may be any of several<br>
types of bus structures including a memory bus or memory controller, a peripheral bus, and<br>
a local bus using any of a variety of bus architectures. By way of example, and not<br>
limitation, such architectures include Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) bus, Micro<br>
Channel Architecture (MCA) bus, Enhanced ISA (EISA) bus, Video Electronics Standards<br>
-4-<br><br>
Association (VESA) local bus. and Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) bus (also<br>
known as Mezzanine bus).<br>
Computer 110 typically includes a variety of computer readable media. Computer<br>
readable media can be any available media that can be accessed by computer 110 and<br>
includes both volatile and nonvolatile media, removable and non-removable media. By<br>
way of example, and not limitation, computer readable media may comprise computer<br>
storage media and communication media. Computer storage media includes both volatile<br>
and nonvolatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or<br>
technology for storage of information such as computer readable instructions, data<br>
structures, program modules or other data. Computer storage media includes. but is not<br>
limited to, RAM, ROM, EEPROM, flash memory or other memory technology, CDROM,<br>
digital versatile disks (DVD) or other optical disk storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic<br>
tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium which<br>
can be used to store the desired information and which can be accessed by computer 110.<br>
Communication media typically embodies computer readable instructions. data structures,<br>
program modules or other data in a modulated data signal such as a carrier wave or other<br>
transport mechanism and includes any information delivery media. The term "modulated<br>
data signal" means a signal that has one or more of its characteristics set or changed in<br>
such a marmer as to encode information in the signal. By way of example, and not<br>
limitation, communication media includes wired media such as a wired network or direct-<br>
wired connection, and wireless media such as acoustic, RF, infrared, and other wireless<br>
rnedia. Combinations of any of the above should also be included within the scope of<br>
computer readable media.<br>
The system memory 130 includes computer storage media in the form of volatile<br>
and/or nonvolatile memory such as read only memory (ROM) 131 and random access<br>
memory (RAM) 132. A basic input/output system 133 (BIOS), containing the basic<br>
routines that help to transfer information between elements within computer 110, such as<br>
during start-up, is typically stored in ROM 131. RAM 132 typically contains data and/or<br>
program modules that are immediately accessible to and/or presently being operated on by<br>
processing unit 120. By way of example, and not limitation, FIG. la illustrates operating<br>
system 134, application programs 135, other program modules 136, and program data 137.<br>
-5-<br><br>
The computer 110 may also include other removable/non-removable;<br>
volatile/nonvolatile computer storage media. By way of example only, FIG. la illustrates a<br>
hard disk drive 141 that reads rrom or vvrites to non-removable, nonvolatile magnetic<br>
media, a magnetic disk drive 151 that reads from or vvrites to a removable, nonvolatile<br>
magnetic disk 152, and an optical disk drive 155 that reads from or writes to a removable,<br>
nonvolatile optical disk 156, such as a CD ROM or other optical media. Other<br>
removable/non-removable, volatile/nonvolatile computer storage media that can be used in<br>
the exemplary operating environment include, but are not limited to. magnetic tape<br>
cassettes, flash memory cards, digital versatile disks, digital video tape, solid state RAM,<br>
solid state ROM, and the like. The hard disk drive 141 is typicaliy connected to the system<br>
bus 121 through a non-removable memory interface such as interface 140, and magnetic<br>
disk drive 151 and optical disk drive 155 are typicaliy connected to the system bus 121 by<br>
a removable memory interface, such as interface 150.<br>
The drives and their associated computer storage media discussed above and<br>
illustrated in FIG. l provide storage of computer readable instructions, data stnictures,<br>
program modules and other data for the computer 110. In FIG. l, for example, hard disk<br>
drive 141 is illustrated as storing operating system 144. application programs 145, other<br>
program modules 146, and program data 147. Note that these components can either be the<br>
same as or different from operating system 134, application programs 135, other program<br>
modules 136, and program data 137. Operating system 144. application programs 145,<br>
other program modules 146, and program data 147 are given different numbers here to<br>
illustrate that, at a minimum, they are different copies. A user may enter commands and<br>
information into the computer 110 through input devices such as a keyboard 162 and<br>
pointing device 161, commonly referred to as a mouse, trackball or touch pad. Other input<br>
devices (not shown) may include a microphone, joystick, game pad, satellite dish, scanner,<br>
or the like. These and other input devices are often connected to the processing unit 120<br>
through a user input interface 160 that is coupled to the system bus 121, but may be<br>
connected by other interface and bus stnictures, such as a parallel port, game port or a<br>
universal serial bus (USB).<br>
A monitor 191 or other type of display device is also connected to the system bus<br>
121 via an interface, such as a video interface 190. A graphics interface 182, such as<br>
-6-<br><br>
Northbridge, may also be connected to the system bus 121. Northbridge is a chipset that<br>
communicates with the CPU, or host processing unit 120, and assumes responsibility for<br>
accelerated graphics port (AGP) Communications. One or more graphics processing units<br>
(GPUs) 184 may communicate with graphics interface 182. Inthis regard, GPUs 184<br>
generally include on-chip memory storage. such as register storage and GPUs 184<br>
communicate with a video memory 186. GPUs 184, however. are but one example of a<br>
coprocessor and thus a variety of coprocessing devices may be included in computer 110.<br>
A monitor 191 or other type of display device is also connected to the system bus 121 via<br>
an interface, such as a video interface 190, which may in turn communicate with video<br>
memory 186. In addition to monitor 191, computers may also include other peripheral<br>
output devices such as speakers 197 and printer 196, which may be connected through an<br>
output peripheral interface 195.<br>
The computer 110 may operate in a networked environment usmg logical<br>
connections to one or more remote computers, such as a remote computer 180. The remote<br>
computer 180 may be a personal computer, a server, a router, a network PC a peer device<br>
or other common network node, and typically includes many or all of the elements<br>
described above relative to the computer 110, although only a memory storage device 181<br>
has been illustrated in FIG. la. The logical connections depicted in FIG. la include a local<br>
area network (LAN) 171 and a wide area network (WAN) 173, but may also include other<br>
networks. Such netwerking environments are commonplace in offices, enterprise-wide<br>
computer networks, intranets and the Internet.<br>
When used in a LAN netwerking environment, the computer 110 is connected to<br>
the LAN 171 through a network interface or adapter 170. When used in a WAN<br>
netwerking environment, the computer 110 typically includes a modem 172 or other means<br>
for establishing Communications over the WAN 173, such as the Internet. The modem 172,<br>
which may be mtemal or extemal, may be connected to the system bus 121 via the user<br>
input interface 160, or other appropriate mechanism. In a networked environment, program<br>
modules depicted relative to the computer 110, or portions thereof, may be stored in the<br>
remote memory storage device. By way of example, and not limitation, FIG. la illustrates<br>
remote application programs 185 as residing on memory device 181. It will be appreciated<br>
-7-<br><br>
that the network connections shówn are exemplary and other means of establishing a<br>
Communications link between the computers may be used.<br>
One of ordinary skill in the art can appreciate that a computer 110 or other cliënt<br>
device can be deployed as part of a computer network. In this regard, the present invention<br>
pertains to any computer system having any nurnber of memory or storage units, and any<br>
number of applications and processes occurring across any number of storage units or<br>
volumes. The present invention may apply to an environment with server computers and<br>
client computers deployed in a network environment, having remote or local storage. The<br>
present invention may also apply to a standalone computing device, having programrning<br>
language functionality, interpretation and execution capabilities.<br>
Systems and Methods for Deterring Software Piracy<br>
FIG. 2 is a block diagram of a system of environment-binding-enforced distnbution<br>
for deterring piracy of software in accordance with one embodiment of the invention.<br>
Server 204 or vendor 202 may be connected to one or more clients 206 or 208 via a<br>
network such as a WAN, LAN (wired or wireless), intranet, the Internet, or other suitable<br>
network. In Fig. 2, the dotted lines illustrate alternate implementations of the invention,<br>
illustrating that server 204 is optiona] since its role is for initial license file discovery and is<br>
not required for implementing the invention.<br>
A software vendor may provide a volume license holder a copy of volume licensed<br>
software 212 on some media such as, but not limited to, a CD ROM. Accompanying the<br>
software 212 may be an enterprise-specific or volume-license-holder-specific VLK 222. In<br>
one embodiment of the invention, the VLK 222 is embedded within a relatively large file,<br>
called the license file 224. The license file 224 may be constructed based upon, for<br>
example, an identificatie n for the company and products that are licensed to the company,<br>
and may include environmental binding information like hashes of the names of domain<br>
controllers (DCs), active directories (ADs), etc. In an exemplary embodiment, the license<br>
file is a relatively large system file. The particular file type selected may be any type of<br>
file type, including, but not limited to image or audio file formats. VLK 222 may be<br>
embedded anywhere in the data, which in one embodiment is then signed with a private<br>
key to generale the license file 224. In one embodiment of the invention, the size of the<br>
license file 224 is greater than 1.44 Megabytes (MB), such as, for example, 2 MB, to<br>
-8-<br><br>
prevent copying the licensé file 224 onto a floppy disk. In one embodiment of the<br>
invention. the licensé file 224 is provided on a CD ROM containing only the licensé file<br>
224 and having a volume label different from the volume label of the CD ROM containing<br>
the associated software 212.<br>
In the above-described environment in which the licensé holdefs software 212 is<br>
distributed among clients 206, 208, etc. At logon, an activation code resident on cliënt<br>
machines 206, 208, etc. reads the content of the licensé file 224 to verify that the licensé<br>
file 224 has not been tampered with. As utilized herein, activation refers to a process for<br>
validating software licensé data, nebvork environment binding and enabling the software<br>
to be functional within a period of time without further binding validation. In this regard,<br>
during the software installation process, VLK 222 and/or licensé file 224 can be<br>
transmitted to clients 208, or to clients 206, e.g., via server 204. The verification process<br>
includes checking the licensé on the local machine agaïnst the binding or policy defmed in<br>
the licensé. It is optional to receive the licensé file from the server location.<br>
The integrity of licensé file 224 can be verified by checking the signature of the<br>
file. If the licensé file 224 has not been tampered with, i.e., if the integrity is verified, the<br>
software is allowed to run. If the licensé file 224 has been tampered with, the software will<br>
run in a reduced functionality mode.<br>
Large scale deployments of software are typically too costly and time-consuming<br>
for an administrator to personally set up large numbers of machines. In addition,<br>
administrators often do not want end users to personally activate their machines. Hence,<br>
such installations are therefore usually automated, using unattended or remote processes.<br>
Activation of volume licensed software can be performed during setup or can be<br>
performed at a later time. An unattended answer file is a text file that is used in conjunction<br>
with a software setup routine to bypass normal setup prompts. An unattended file can, for<br>
example, enter a VLK automatically, configure proxy settings and auto-activate the system<br>
on behalf of the end user, either through the target machine's local area netwerk (LAN) or<br>
via the Internet. Activation can also be performed after setup using command-line scripts.<br>
When installing the volume licensed software on clients 206, 208, etc. an<br>
installation image may be prepared with the aid of an unattended file. The unattended file<br>
is a specialized script that performs the unattended installation. The software 212 is<br>
-9-<br><br>
installed on the cliënt machines 206, 208, etc. by executing the script. The script sets the<br>
location of the license file 224 to a list of known locations, including server 204.<br>
Alternatively, the license file 224 may be copied onto the cliënt machines if the file is part<br>
of the installation image. Upon logon, the license file 224 is read, the data authenticated<br>
and the cliënt machines 206, 208, etc, are activated. If the environment characteristics<br>
specified in the license file 224 cannot be verified while the system is connected, the<br>
system will continue to function in the grace period, Beyond the grace penod. the system<br>
may function in the reduced functionality mode or the end user may request an extension<br>
from software vendor 202. If the license data cannot be verified while the system is<br>
disconnected, the software will continue to be functional only with disconnected features<br>
until the system joins a network again.<br>
In various embodiments, when in the grace period and there is network<br>
connectivity, but the system of the invention cannot validate the environment, the system<br>
can contact a central location that can check for leaKage and grant an additional term of<br>
grace period. For example, a hash of license file and HWÏD could be transmitted to the<br>
central location, and a server can check the hash agüinst a black list, and then send down to<br>
the cliënt location a signed license with a perpetual date.<br>
In this regard, in one embodiment, if the VLK file check fails. the result is failure.<br>
In another embodiment, if the VLK file check fails, the VLK license file can be parsed,<br>
and then a search may be made of various listed servers for a new license file.<br>
In a black-op scenario, an enterprise cannot obtain a license from the software<br>
vendor in connection with the VLK environment. Thus, in one embodiment, in the black-<br>
op case, the enterprise can generale its own license file signed by piece(s) of hardware that<br>
are issued by the software vendor.<br>
FIG. 3 is a block diagram of an enterprise off-line system 250 for deterring<br>
software piracy in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. In the off-line<br>
system, an enterprise receives the VLK 222 and the software vendor 202 supplied security<br>
hardware device 252. The hardware device 252 is c^pable of performing signing<br>
operations to generate license file 225 which is identical to license file 224 in format The<br>
installation of the volume licensed software on cliënt machines 206 and 208, the activation<br>
process, and the license validation procedure are the same as described in FIG 2 in which<br>
- 10-<br><br>
the VLK license file is signed and also from the software vendor. As with Fig. 2. in Fig. 3.<br>
the dotted lines illustrate alternate implementations of the invention.<br>
FIG. 4 is a flow diagram of a method of making software pirating more diffïcult in<br>
environment binding enforced system. At step 402, an enterprise-specific VLK and its<br>
associated license file are received. An installation image of the associated volume-<br>
licensed software may be prepared, for installation on one or more cliënt machines. At step<br>
404, the enterprise-specific or volume-license-holder-specific license file may be stored on<br>
a central server or deployed to cliënt machines. The enterprise-specific or volume-license-<br>
holder-specific license file is not freely accessible to cliënt machines associated with the<br>
server. A specialized script may be prepared that performs the unattended installation.<br>
At step 406, the software is installed on the cliënt machine or machines. At step<br>
408, the script sets the location of the ïicense file in a list of known locations in the system,<br>
either as deployed on the cliënt machine(s) or by publishing the locations of the license file<br>
to cliënt machine(s), e.g., via windows management interface (WMI) or via a hardcoded<br>
registry key. At step 410. upon logon, an activation routine retrieves the location of the<br>
license file. In the case of the license file being on a remote server, the script may<br>
optionally verify the location of the license file, e.g., by comparing Internet Protocol (IP)<br>
addresses. At step 412, the activation routine reads the data from the license file, verifies<br>
that the data is authentic. verifies the environment characteristics specified in the license<br>
file, and activates the software. If the environment characteristics specified in the license<br>
file cannot be verified while the system is connected, the system wil! continue to function<br>
in the grace period. Bevond the grace period, the system may function in the reduced<br>
functionality mode or the end user may request an extension from software vendor. If the<br>
license data cannot be verified while the system is disconnected, the software will continue<br>
to be functional only with disconnected features until the system joins a network again.<br>
