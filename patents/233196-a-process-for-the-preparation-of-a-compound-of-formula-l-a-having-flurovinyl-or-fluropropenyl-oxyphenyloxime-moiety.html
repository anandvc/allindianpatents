The present invention relates to novel fungicidal compounds having a fluorovinyl-or fluoropropenyl-oxyphenyloxirne moiety, a process for preparing same and a fungicidal composition containing same as an active ingredient.<br>
Description of the Prior Art<br>
A number of fungicidal compounds have been in practical use to protect crops from various pathogenic fungi, and the\ may be classified into several groups according to their similar structural features. However, the repetitive use of a fungicide over a long period induces the appearance of new fungal strains resistant not only 10 the particular fungicide but also to related fungicides having common structural features. For this reason, continuous efforts have been undertaken to develop novel fungicides.<br>
Such efforts have led to the development of new fungicides, e.g., propenoic esters derived from strobilurin (U.S. Patent No. 4,994,495; WO 94/19331; U.S. Patent No. 5,003,101) and other propenoic ester fungicides disclosed in EP A 0 278 595 (Zeneca), EP A 0 782 982 (Novatis), WO 96/33164 (Ciba-Geigy), WO 96'33164 (Rhone-Poulenc AgTo). WO 98/56774 (BASF), WO 99/06379 (BASF), WO 99/23066 (Agrevo UK). German Patent Nos. 724,200 and 732,846 (both BASF), and British Patent No. 22.893 (Agrevo UK). However, these propenoic ester derivatives still have the problem of limited fungicidal activity.<br>

A mycelial mass was ground using a homogenizer, inoculated uniformly on soil of a pot wherein a Nakdong rice plant having 2 or 3 leaves and an height of 5 cm grew, and kept in humidity polyvinyl chamber for 5 days to induce RSB. L A. on a leaf sheath was measured to calculate an C.V.<br>
