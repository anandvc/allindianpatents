Description<br>
Percyquinnin, a process for its production and its use as a pharmaceutical.<br>
This invention relates to a compound named Percyquinnin, which is obtainable by cultivation of the Basidiomycete Stereum complicatum, ST 001837 (DSM 13303), and to its pharmaceuticaily acceptable salts and derivatives. The present invention further relates to a process for the production of Percyquinnin, to the fungus ST 001837 (DSM 13303), to the use of Percyquinnin and its pharmaceuticaily acceptable salts and derivatives as pharmaceuticals, in particular to their use as lipase inhibitors, and to pharmaceutical compositions comprising Percyquinnin or a pharmaceuticaily acceptable salt or derivative thereof.<br>
Lipid metabolism normally keeps a delicate balance between synthesis and degradation. When the balance is upset, hyperlipidemia may occur, which in turn can cause atherosclerosis, hypertension, diabetes etc. Modulators of lipid metabolism are expected to be useful in controlling these disorders. Inhibition of lipolysis in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) is supposed to reduce hyperglycemia. The initial event in the utilization of fat as an energy source is the hydrolysis of triacylglycerol by lipases, e.g. hormone sensitive lipase and monoacylglycerol lipase. Hydrolyses of triacylglycerols let to increase levels of glycerol and fatty acids in the blood. Lipase inhibitors are expected to reduce both plasma fatty acid levels and hyperglycemia with reduced side effects.<br>
Obesity and hypercholesterolemia are to a relevant degree related to high nutritional fat intake. The key enzyme of dietary triglyceride absorption is pancreatic lipase. Inhibition of pancreatic lipase may therefor result in inhibition of fat absorption.<br>
It has now been found that a novel compound named Percyquinnin inhibits the lipolyse. The present invention thus relates to Percyquinnin, a compound of the formula:<br><br><br>
and to its pharmaceutically acceptable salts and derivatives, such as esters, ethers and obvious chemical equivalents, including all stereoisomeric forms and all tautomeric forms.<br>
Percyquinnin has the molecular formula C12H16O3{208 Da) and may be characterized by any one or more of its physico-chemical and spectral properties given beiow, such as its 1HNMR spectroscopic data and its 13C NMR spectroscopic data, provided in Table 1 and 2.<br>
Percyquinnin may be described as a new p-lactone with an annelated five membered ring carrying a hydroxymethyl moiety and a 2,3-isopentenyi sidechain at the a-position of the lactone. Percyquinnin has a hitherto unreported new structure. A chemical abstract literature search established Percyquinnin to be a new compound. No other compound represented the structural features of Percyquinnin.<br>
Percyquinnin is obtainable by cultivation of a microorganism referred to as culture no. ST 001837 (henceforth referred to as ST 001837), This fungus used for the production of Percyquinnin was collected at Percy Quinn, Mississippi State Park  in Pike County, USA. The fungus ST 001837 belongs to the order of Basidiomycetes species Stereum complicatum and has been deposited on 11th of February 2000 with the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSM2 - Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen<br><br>
GmbH), Braunschweig, Germany and has been given the accession number DSM No. 13303.<br>
Thus, the present invention further provides a process for the production of the novel compound named Percyquinnin from Basiciomycetes species ST 001537, its mutants and yanants, under aerobic conditions in a nutrient medium containing one or more sources of carbon and one or more sources of nitrogen and optionally nutrient inorganic salts and/or trace elements, followed by isolation of the said compound and purification in a customary manner.<br>
The nutrient medium preferably contains sources of carbon, nitrogen and nutrient inorganic salts. The carbon sources are, for example, starch, glucose, sucrose, dextrin, fructose, molasses, glycerol, lactose or galactose, preferably glucose. The sources of nitrogen are, for example, soyabean meal, peanut meal, yeast extract, beef extract, peptone, malt extract, com steep liquor, gelatin or casamion acids, preferably malt extract and yeast extract The nutrient inorganic salts are. for example sodium hydrogen phosphate, potassium hydrogen phosphate, ammonium hydrogen phosphate, sodium chloride, calcium chloride, calcium carbonate, potassium nitrate, ammonium sulphate or magnesium sulphate, preferably ammonium hydrogen phosphate.<br>
The cultivation of ST 001837 may be carried out at temperatures between 20-35°C and pH between 3.0 and 8.0. Preferably ST 001837 is cultivated at 25°C (±1°C) and pH between 3 and 5.<br>
The cultivation of ST 001837 is preferably carried out for 96-300 hours when an optimal yield of the lipase inhibitor Percyquinnin of the invention is obtained. It is particularly preferred to carry out the cultivation by fermentation for 216-264 hours under submerged conditions for example in shake flasks as well as in laboratory fermenters. The progress of fermentation and formation of the Percyquinnin can be detected by High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and by measuring the bioactivity of the culture broth. In the resulting culture broth Percyquinnin is present in the culture filtrate as well as in mycelium, preferably in the mycelium.<br><br>
Percyquinnin can be isolated using known separation techniques. Thus, it can be recovered from the culture filtrate by extraction with a water immiscible solvent such as ethyi acetate, dichloromethane, chloroform or butanol at pH 5-8 or by hydrophobic interaction chromatography using polymeric resins such as "Diaion HP-20® or "MCI® Gel CHP-20P" (Mitsubishi Chemical Industries Limited, Japan). "Amberiite XAD'^ (Rohm and Hass Industries U.S.A.), activated charccal or ion exchange chromatography at pH 5-8. The preferred method is chromatography on MCI® Ge! CHP-20P. The active m.aterial can also be recovered from mycelium by extraction with a water miscible solvent such as methanol, acetone, acetonitrile. n-propanol or /so-propano! or a water immiscible solvent such as ethyl acetate, dichloromethane, chloroform or butano! at pH 5-8 and the preferred method is the extraction with methanol. Concentration and lyophilization of the extracts gives the active crude material.<br>
The inhibitor Percyquinnin of the present invention may, for example.be recovered from the crude materia! as follows ;<br>
By fractionation using any of the following techniques: normal phase chromatography (using alumina or silica gel as stationary phase and eluents such as petroleum ether, ethy! acetate, methylene chloride, acetone, chloroform, methanol or combinations thereof and additions of amines such as NEts). reverse phase chromatography (using reverse phase silica gei like dimethyloctadecytsilyl-silica gel, also called RP-18 or dimethyloctylsilyl silica gel also called RP-8 as stationary phase and eluents such as water, buffers viz. phosphate, acetate, citrate (pH 2-8) and organic solvents such as methanol, acetonitrile. acetone, tetrahydrofuran or combinations of these solvents), gel permeation chromatography using resins such as®Sephadex LH-20 (Pharmacia Chemical Industries. Sweden), TSKge! ^Toyopear! HW (TosoHaas. Tosoh Corporation, Japan) in solvents such as methanol, chloroform, acetone, ethyi acetate or their combinations or ®Sephadex G-10 and G-25 in water; or by counter-current chromatography using a biphasic eluent system made up of two or more solvents such as water, methanol, ethanol, iso-propanol, n-propanol, tetrahydrofuran, acetone, acetonitrile, methylene chloride, chloroform, ethyl acetate, petroleum ether, benzene and<br><br>
toluene. These techniques may be used repeatedly or a combination cf the different techniques may be used. The preferred method is chromatography over reverse phase silica gel (RP-18).<br>
The compound Percyquinnin may be convened into pharmaceutically acceptable salts and derivatives, like esters and ethers and other obvious chemical equivalents, which are all covered by the present invention. The salts and derivatives can be prepared by standard procedures known to one skilled in the art. Salts like sodium and potassium salts, for example, may be prepared by treating Percyquinnin with suitable sodium or potassium bases.<br>
Esters and ethers may be prepared by the methods given in the literature, for example, in Advanced Organic Synthesis, 4th Edition, J, March, John Wiley &amp; Sons., 1992. Esters may be formed by reaction with carboxylic acids or e. g, amino acids e.g. leucin, glycin or alanin. The amino group of the amino acid may be deprotected after esterification or protected e. g. with a formyl group. Esterification may be done in the presence of a dehydrating agent e.g. dicydohexylcarbodiimid (DCC) as described in the literature (Smith et aL, J, Am. Chem, Soc. 1958, 80, 6204; Arrieta et al. Synth. Commun 1983, 13, 471).<br>
The double bonds may be reduced by the methods given in the literature, for example in Advanced Organic Synthesis, 4th Edition, J. March, John Wiley &amp; Sons., 1992, p. 771-775 or as in R! Bloch et al., J. Org, Chem, 1987, 52, 4603-4505. They may be hydrohalogenated by methods described by H.O. House in "Modern Synthetic Reactions", W.A. Benjymin, Inc., New York (1972), pp 446-452. Hydroxyiated derivatives may be produced by reaction of the double bonds with reagents like OSO4 as described in the literature e.g. in Chem. Rev. 1980, 80, 187.<br>
Derivatives may also be formed by conversion of the double bonds into epoxides by oxidation e.g. with MCPBA like described in Advanced Organic Synthesis. 4th Edition, J. March, John Wiley &amp; Sons., 1992. p. 826 or as in A. J. Pearson et al., J. Org, Chem. 1986, 51, 2505-2511.<br><br>
Derivatives may also be formed by ozonoiysis of the double bond of the isopentenyl side chain. Depending on the work-up procedure this may let to an aldehyd (e.g. with Zn/ HOAc or dimethylsuifid/methanol). to an carboxylic acid (e.g. with H2O2) or to an alcohol (e.g. with LiAIH4 or NaBHu) as functional group [W. Curruthers, "Some Modern Methods of Organic Synthesis'. Cambridge University Press (1971), Chpt. 6; White, King and O'Brien, Tetrahedron Lett. 3591 (1971); Bailey, P. S., "Ozonisation in Organic Chemistry". V0LI and Vol. 2, New York. Academic Press (1978, 1982)]. By reaction of the so formed aldehydes with phosphoranes as known in the literature as the Wittig reaction, side chains with 4 to 10 carbon atoms may be introduced. The new introduced chains may carry e. g. OR1 (R1= H or alky! with 1 to 4 carbon atoms), NR2R3 (R2R3=H or alkylrest with 1 to 4 carbon atoms), F, 01. Br or I as functional groups as described in: HJ. Bestmann et al.. "Selected Topics of the Wittig Reaction in the Synthesis of Natural Products". Topics in Current Chemistry 109.85(1983).<br>
Percyquinnin shows inhibition of lipase with an IC50 of 2 µM (NBD-assay.see example 6).<br>
The invention also relates to the use of Percyquinnin in the form of their racemates, racemic mixtures and pure enantiomers, and to their diastereomers and mixtures thereof.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are particularly suitable for medical applications because of their greater solubility in water compared with the initial compounds on which they are based. These salts must have a pharmaceutically acceptable anion or cation. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of Percyquinnin are salts of inorganic acids such as hydrochloric add, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric, metaphosphoric, nitric and sulfuric acids, and organic acids such as, for example, acetic acid, benzenesulfonic, benzoic, citric, ethanesulfonic, fumaric, gluconic, glycolic, isethionic. lactic, lactobionic. maleic, malic, methanesulfonic, succinic, p-toluenesulfonic, tartaric and trifluoroacetic acids. It is particularly preferred to use the chloride for medical purposes. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable basic salts are<br><br>
ammonium salts, alkali metal salts (such as sodium and potassium salts) and alkaline earth metal salts (such as magnesium and calcium salts).<br>
Salts with a pharmaceutically unacceptable anion likewise fall within the scope of the invention as useful intermediates for preparing or purifying pharmaceutically acceptable salts and/or for use in non-therapeutic, for example in vitro, applications.<br>
The term 'physiologically functional derivative" used herein refers to any physiologically tolerated derivative of a compound according to the invention, for example an ester, which is able on administration to a mammal, such as, for example, to humans, to form (directly or indirectly) such a compound or an active metabolite thereof.<br>
A further aspect of this invention is the use of prodrugs of Percyquinnin. Such prodrugs can be metabolized in vivo to Percyquinnin. These prodrugs may themselves be active or not.<br>
Percyquinnin may also exist in various polymorphous forms, for example as amorphous and crystalline polymorphous forms. All polymorphous forms of Percyquinnin fall within the scope of the invention and are a further aspect of the invention.<br>
All references hereinafter to Percyquinnin refer to Percyquinnin as described above and to the salts, solvates and physiologically functional derivatives thereof as described herein.<br>
The amount of Percyquinnin necessary to achieve the desired biological effect depends on a number of factors, for example the specific compound chosen, the intended use, the mode of administration and the clinical condition of the patient. The daily dose is generally in the range from 0.3 mg to 100 mg (typically from 3 mg to 50 mg) per day and per kilogram body weight, for example 3-10 mg/kg/day. An intravenous dose may be, for example, in the range from 0.3 mg to 1.0 mg/kg, which can suitably be administered as infusion of 10 ng to 100 ng per kilogram and per<br><br>
minute. Infusion solutions suitable for these purposes may contain, for example, from 0.1 ng to 10 mg, typically from 1 ng to 10 mc. per milliliter. Single doses may contain, for example, from 1 mg to 10 g of the active ingredient. Thus, amipoules for injections may contain, for example, from 1 mg to 100 mg, and single dose formulations which can be administered orally, such as, for example, tablets or capsules, may contain, for example, from 1,0 to 1000 mg, typically from 10 to 600 mg. In the case of pharmaceutically acceptable salts, the above weight data are based on the weight of the aminothiazole ion derived from the salt. Percyquinnin can be used for prophylaxis or therapy of the above mentioned states themselves as compound, but they are preferably in the form of a pharmaceutical composition with a compatible carrier. The carrier must, of course, be compatible in the sense of compatibility with other ingredients of the composition and not be harmful to the patient's health. The carrier may be a solid or a liquid or both and is preferably formulated with the compound as single dose, for example as tablet, which may contain from 0,05% to 95% by weight of the active ingredient. The pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention may be produced by one of the known pharmaceutical methods which essentially consists of mixing the ingredients with pharmacologically acceptable carriers and/or excipients.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention are those suitable for oral, rectal, topical, peroral (for example sublingual) and parenteral (for example subcutaneous, intramuscular, intradermal or intravenous) administration, although the most suitable mode of administration depends in each individual case on the nature and severity of the condition to be treated and on the nature of Percyquinnin used in each case. Coated formulations and coated slow-release formulations also fall v/ithin the scope of the invention. Acid- and gastric fluid-resistant formulations are preferred. Suitable gastric fluid-resistant coatings comprise cellulose acetate phthalate, polyvinyl acetate phthalate, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate and anionic polymers of methacryiic acid and methyl methacrylate.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutical compounds for oral administration may be in the form of separate units such as, for example, capsules, cachets, pastilles or tablets, each of which contains a defined amount of Percyquinnin; as powder or granules; as solution<br><br>
or suspension in an aqueous or nonaqueous liquid; or as an oii-in-water or water-in-oi! emulsion. These compositions may, as already mentioned, be prepared by any suitable pharmaceuticai method which induces a step in which the active ingredient and the carrier (which may consist of one or more additional ingredients) are brought into contact. !n general, the compositions are produced by uniform and homogeneous muxing of the active ingredient with a liquid and/or finely dispersed solid carrier, after which the product is shaped if necessary. Thus, for example, a tablet can be produced by compressing or shaping the powder or granules of the compound, where appropriate with one or more additional ingredients. Compressed tablets may be produced by tabletting the compound in free-flowing form, such as. for example, a powder or granules, where appropriate mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent and/or one (or more) surface-active/dispersing agents in a suitable machine. Shaped tablets can be produced by shaping, in a suitable machine, the compound which is in powder form and has been moistened with an inert liquid diluent.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for peroral (sublingual) administration comprise suckable tablets which contain Percyquinnin with a flavoring, normally sucrose, and gum arabic or tragacanth, and pastilles which contain the compound in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerol or sucrose and gum arabic.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutical compositions for parenteral administration comprise preferably sterile aqueous preparations of Percyquinnin, which are preferably isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient. These preparations are preferably administered intravenously, although administration can also take place by subcutaneous, intramuscular or intradermal injection. These preparations can preferably be produced by mixing the compound with water and making the resulting solution sterile and isotonic with blood. Injectable compositions according to the invention generally contain from 0.1 to 5% by weight of the active compound.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutical compositions for rectal administration are preferably in the form of single-dose suppositories. These can be produced by mixing Percyquinnin<br><br>
with one or more conventional solid carriers, for example cocoa butter, and shaping the resulting mixture.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutical compositions for topical use on the skin are preferably in the form of an ointment, cream, lotion, paste, spray, aerosol or oil. Carriers which can be used are petrolatum, lanolin, polyethylene glycols, alcohols and combinations of two or more of these substances. The active ingredient is generally present in a concentration of from 0.1 to 15% by weight of the composition, for example from 0.5 to 2%.<br>
Transdermal administration is also possible. Suitable pharmaceutical compositions for transdermal applications may be in the form of single plasters which are suitable for long-term dose contact with the patients epidermis. Plasters of this type suitably contain the active ingredient in an aqueous solution which is buffered where appropriate, dissolved and/or dispersed in an adhesive or dispersed in a polymer. A suitable active ingredient concentration is about 1% to 35%, preferably about 3% to 15%. As a particular option, the active ingredient can be released by electrotransport or iontophoresis as described, for example, in Pharmaceutical Research. 2 (6): 318 (1986).<br>

Preparation and Purification .of Lipase<br>
Adipocytes from male rats (Wistar 220-250 g) were isolated by collagenase treatment as described in the literature. The fat cells of 10 rats were washed three times each by flotation with 50 ml homogenization buffer (25 m! Tris/HCl. pH 7.4, 0.25 M sucrose, 1mM EDTA, ImM DTT, 10 pg/ml Leupeptin, 10 µg/ml Antipain, 20 µg/ml Pepstatin). Afterwards 10 ml homogenization buffer was added. The fat cells were homogenized in a teflon-in-glass device (Braun-Melsungen) at 1500 rpm and 15 °C. The homogeneous product was centrifuged (Sorvall SM 24 tubes, 500 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C). The layer between the upper fat layer and the pellet was separated<br><br>
and centrifuged again. Separation of the under layer was repeated and centrifuged a third time at 2000 rpm for 45 min at 4 °C. The resulting mother layer was added to 1 g Heparin Sepharose (Pharmacia-Biotech, CL-6B, washed five times v/iih 25 mM Tris/HCI, pH 7.4. 150 mM NaCl). After incubation for 60 min at-4 °C (shaked in intervals of 15 min) the solution was centrifuged (Sorvall SM24 tubes, 3000 rpm, 10 min, 4 *=C). The upper layer was adjusted to pH 5.2 with acetic acid and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C, The precipitates were isolated by centrifugation (Sorvall SS34 tubes, 12000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C) and suspended in 2.5 ml 20 mM Tris/HCI, pH 7,0, 1mM EDTA, 65 mM NaCI. 13% sucrose, 1mM DTT, 10 pg/ml Leupeptin/PepstatinAntipain. The suspension was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 25 mM Tris/HCI, pH 7.4, 50% glycerols, 1mM DTT. 10 pg/ml Leupeptin, Pepstatin, Antipain and aftepA'ards absorbed on a hydroxyapatit column (0.1 g/1 ml suspension equilibrated with 10 mM pottasium phosphate, pH 7.0, 30% glycerol, 1 mM DTT). The column was washed with the equilibration buffer for four times (flow: 20-30 ml/h). The lipase eluted with 0.5 M pottasium phosphate buffer. The product was dialyzed and concentrated (5-10 times) by ultrafiltration (Amicon Diaflo PM 10) at 4 °C. The semipure lipase can be stored for 4-6 weeks at -70 °C.<br>
Example 6: Bioactivity Assay<br>
A fluorescent lipid analog, mono-NBD-acylglycerol (NAG) was used as substrate, which shifts its color upon integration into phospholipid vesicles from 481 nm to 550 nm. The test compound solved in DMSO was diluted with assay buffer (25 mM Tris/HCI, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCI) 1:5, To 2.5µl of this solution 180 µl of sonicated substrate solution were added (20 µg/ml phosphatidylcholine, 10 µg/ml phosphatidylinositol, 50 µg/ml NAG in assay buffer). After preincubation at 30 °C for 15 min 20 µl of enzyme solution, prediluted 1:2 in assay buffer were added and absorption at 485 nm was immediately measured. After 60 min incubation at 30 °C absorption was determined again. The increase in absorbance at 480 nm was a<br><br>
measurement for the enzyme activity. The determination of IC50 values was carried out using 10 concentrations of the freshly dissolved test compound. For data analysis, the software packet GRAPHIT , Eisvier-Biosoft was used.<br>
