				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method and a device<br>
for cooling a high voltage transformer for a microwave oven,<br>
and more particularly to a method and a device for cooling a<br>
high voltage transformer for a microwave oven so as to rapidly<br>
remove heat generated from a coil and a core in the operation<br>
of the high voltage transformer, thereby improving performance<br>
and quality of the microwave oven and the high voltage<br>
transformer.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
Generally, high voltage transformers are used in<br>
electronic appliances for preparing food using a high<br>
frequency, such as microwave ovens. The high voltage<br>
transformer is a kind of a power feed unit, which heats a<br>
heater of a magnetron for generating high frequency microwave<br>
and simultaneously constitutes a half-wave voltage doubler<br>
circuit, thereby applying high voltage of 4,000V to the<br>
magnetron via a condenser so that the magnetron generates the<br>
high frequency microwave.<br>
In a process for manufacturing the above-described high<br>
voltage transformer, in order to protect the high voltage<br>
transformer from vibration, noise and heat generated by a<br>
strong magnetic field occurring when voltage is applied to an<br>
input side of the high voltage transformer, an impregnation<br>
step, in which the high voltage transformer is impregnated with<br>
an impregnant such as varnish, must be performed.<br>
In case the high voltage transformer is manufactured by<br>
passing through the aforementioned impregnation step, the<br>
process for manufacturing the high voltage transformer is<br>
complicated and consequently equipment for manufacturing the<br>
high voltage transformer is increased in size. Further,<br>
since, in the high voltage transformer manufactured by passing<br>
through the impregnation step, the heat generated from the<br>
coil is not conducted to the core or the outside, the high<br>
voltage transformer is disadvantageous that it is difficult to<br>
miniaturize.<br>
The aforementioned high voltage transformer has another<br>
problem. That is, fires frequently break out by the<br>
thermosetting of varnish due to the heat. Since the coil<br>
charged with electricity is exposed to the outside, the coil<br>
is always in danger of fires and electric shocks.<br>
In order to solve such problems, the present inventor(s)<br>
filed a method for manufacturing a non-impregnated high<br>
voltage transformer. Hereinafter, this patent application<br>
will be described with reference to Figs. 1 and 2.<br>
A plurality of E-type and I-type cores 1 and 2 are<br>
continuously manufactured by punching a steel plate 100 using<br>
a press, and vertically stacked so that the stack structures<br>
of the E-type and I-type cores 1 and 2 have a designated <br><br>
height so as to correspond to a width of a hole of a bobbin 4<br>
to be integrated therewith.<br>
The stack structure of the E-type cores 1 is inserted<br>
into the holes of the bobbins 4, provided with coils 5 wound<br>
thereon. Then, a two component adhesive 7, which is rapidly<br>
cured at room temperature, is coated at a designated amount<br>
and thickness on the upper surface of a central supporting<br>
portion la of the stack structure of the E-type cores 1, and<br>
the stack structure of the I-type cores 2 is attached to the<br>
central portion la coated with the two component adhesive 7.<br>
Contact portions between both external corners of the<br>
upper surfaces of both side supporting portions lb of the<br>
stack structure of the E-type cores 1 and both edges of the<br>
lower surface of the stack structure of the I-type cores 2 are<br>
welded, and several portions along the outer circumferences of<br>
the stack structure of the E-type cores 1 and the stack<br>
structure of the I-type core 2 are welded, thereby forming<br>
several welding areas 8.<br>
An anticoirosive is sprayed on the surfaces of the stack structures of the E-type and I-type cores 1 and 2 and the<br>
exposed welding areas 8, thereby forming a rustproof layer 3.<br>
Embossed segments 6a or rivets 6b are used to fix the stack<br>
structures of the E-type and I-type cores 1 and 2 so as to<br>
form one block, thereby manufacturing a high voltage<br>
transformer.<br>
As described above, the process for manufacturing the<br>
high voltage transformer without an impregnation step reduces<br>
a number of steps, improves productivity of the high voltage<br>
transformer, reduces the production cost of the high voltage<br>
transformer, and increases quality of the high voltage<br>
transformer due to the reduction of vibration and noise<br>
generation.<br>
Insulation papers 10 are disposed along the outer<br>
surfaces of the coils 5 contacting the stack structures of the<br>
E-type cores 1 and I-type cores 2, thereby conducting the heat<br>
generated from the coil 5 to the core.<br>
 in the above-described conyentional high voltage<br>
transformer, the insulation papers are used to conduct the<br>
heat generated from the coil to the core. However, since the<br>
heat generated from the coil is conducted to the core only via<br>
the insulation papers, a sufficient cooling rate by the heat<br>
conduction is not expected.<br>
That is, the heat generated from the coil is conducted<br>
to the core via the insulation papers, and the heated core is<br>
cooled by means of a blast fan serving to forcibly cool the<br>
heat. However, since a portion of the high voltage<br>
transformer mounted on an external device is sealed, the<br>
cooling effect due to the forcible cooling using the blast fan<br>
is weak.<br>
Particularly, since the high voltage transformer is not<br>
sealed but exposed to the outside when the high voltage<br>
transformer is mounted on the external device, the high<br>
voltage transformer exposes to a user to several dangers, such<br>
as an electrical shock, thereby being poor in terms of safety.<br>

of the above problems, and it is an object of the present<br>

A non-impregnated high voltage transformer 50 of the<br>
present invention is manufactured by continuously punching a<br>
steel plate by a press so as to form E-type and I-type thin<br>
plates, by stacking the E-type and I-type thin plates so as to<br>
form E-type and I-type cores, by inserting first and second<br>
coils into the E-type core and inserting a pass core and a<br>
heater coil into the first and second coils, and by attaching<br>
the I-type core to the E-type core using a two component<br>
adhesive.<br>
In order to prevent the separation of the E-type and I-<br>
type cores, contact portions between the E-type core and the<br>
I-type core and several portions along the outer<br>
circumferences of the E-type and I-type cores are welded.<br>
Then, embossed segments or rivets are used to fix the E-type<br>
and I-type cores in a stacking direction. An anticorrosive is sprayed on the surfaces of the E-type and I-type cores and the<br>
exposed welding portions, thereby protecting the manufactured<br>
high voltage transformer from corrosion, vibration and noise.<br>
By the above process, the manufacturing of the high voltage<br>
transformer is completed. <br>
The high voltage transformer 50 manufactured by the above-described process is accommodated within a container 51<br>
with a designated size so as to receive the high voltage transformer 50 therein. The container 51 is sealed with a<br>
cover 52, and a cooling oil 54 is injected into the container<br>
51 via an injection port 53 formed in the cover 52. Then, the<br>
injection port 53 is sealed. The cooling oil 54 injected into the container 51 absorbs heat of a high temperature generated<br>
from a coil 56 and a core 57 of the high voltage transformer<br>
50, and then radiates the absorbed heat via the container 51<br>
and the cover 52, thereby serving to cool the high voltage<br>
transformer 50.<br>
Electrical connection lines 60 are connected to<br>
terminals 61 provided on the upper surface of the cover 52 so<br>
as to supply power to the high voltage transformer 50 and to<br>
supply the power from the high voltage transformer 50 to an<br>
end external device.<br>
Preferably, the container 51 is made of a material with<br>
excellent thermal conductivity such as aluminum or thermally<br>
rolled steel plate, and the cooling oil 54 injected into the<br>
container 51 is a nonconductiye and incombustible cooling oil. <br><br>
Fixing means 65 is further provided within the container 51 so<br>
as to fix the high voltage transformer 50 and the electrical<br>
connection lines 60 leading from the transformer 50 and to<br>
maintain a gap between the high voltage transformer 50 and the<br>
container 51.<br>
The fixing means 65 comprises a lower guide 66 disposed<br>
on the bottom of the container 51 so as to support the lower<br>
surface of the high voltage transformer 50, and a upper guide<br>
67 disposed on the top of the container 51 so as to support<br>
the upper surface of the high voltage transformer 50 and the<br>
electrical connection lines 60.<br>
The lower guide 66 includes a base 68 formed as a thin<br>
film and made of a fire retarding material by molding,<br>
provided with legs 67 protruding therefrom, and a through hole<br>
69 formed in the center of the base 68 so that the cooling oil<br>
54 is injected to the container 51 therethrough.<br>
A dented step 70 is formed along the edge of the through<br>
hole 69 so as to receive and guide the edge of the lower.<br>
surface of the high voltage transformer 50. Otherwise, L-type<br>
dented steps may be respectively formed on only four corners<br>
of the bottom of the container 51 so as to guide four corners<br>
of the lower surface of the high voltage transformer 50.<br>
The lower guide 67 includes a flat base 75 made of a<br>
fire retarding material by molding, and ribs 76 protruding<br>
from the upper and lower surfaces of the base 75 and so as to<br>
compensate the gap between the upper surface of the high<br>
voltage transformer 50 and the cover 52.<br>
Generally, the terminals 61 include two or three units<br>
separated from each other by a designated distance. In case the terminals 61 include five units separated from each other<br>
and integrated into one block, the terminals 61 are<br>
advantageous in terms of automation of cooling the high<br>
voltage transformer 50, and operation efficiency and<br>
productivity of the device for cooling the high voltage<br>
transformer 50. However, in this case, since a distance<br>
between pins 77 connected to the electrical connection lines f 60 7 is short, the terminals 61 is influenced by breakdown voltage. <br>
Herein, an upper insulation paper 77-1 is disposed below<br>
pin holes 52-1 formed through the cover 52, and a lower<br>
insulation paper 78 is disposed on the lower surfaces of heads<br>
of the pins 77 fixed to the pin holes 52-1 by means of<br>
packings 77-2. The lower insulation paper 78 is cut at areas<br>
between the pins 77, and the cut portions of the lower<br>
insulation paper 78 are downwardly bent. The downwardly bent<br>
portions 79 of the lower insulation paper 78 serve to<br>
guarantee a sufficient insulation distance between the pins<br>
77.<br>
Figs. 7 and 8 show auxiliary cooling means 80 for<br>
rapidly cooling the cooling oil 54 absorbing the heat<br>
generated from the coil 56 and the core 57, installed on the<br>
external surface of the container 51 accommodating the high<br>
voltage transformer 50.<br>
The auxiliary cooling means 80 may include a plurality<br>
of folds 81 formed integrally with the container 51 as shown<br>
in Fig. 7, or a plurality of radiation fins 82 formed on the external surface of the container 51 and separated from each<br>
other by the same distance as shown in Fig. 8, thereby rapidly<br>
cooling the container 51 absorbing the heat conducted from the<br>
cooling oil 54 in forcibly cooling the heat by means of a<br>
blast fan.<br>

effectively treat the electric connection lines 60 leading<br>
from the high voltage transformer 50, and to improve a fixed<br>
structure of the container 51.<br>
For this purpose, the container 51 comprises a base 101,<br>
a case 102, and a cover 103. Corrugated portions 108 with concave portions 10 6 and convex portions 107 in a semicircular<br>
shape are formed on each of side surfaces of the case 102 of<br>
the container 51, thereby more rapidly cooling the cooling oil<br>
54 absorbing the conducted heat by convection current.<br>
Instead of the aforementioned semicircular shape, each<br>
of the corrugated portions 108 may have various shapes such as<br>
rectangle, triangle, etc., as long as the corrugated portions<br>
108 include the concave portions 106 and the convex portions<br>
107 arranged in a horizontal direction of the side surfaces<br>
105 of the case 102.<br>
Alternatively, the corrugated portions 108 may include<br>
the concave portions 106 and the convex portions 107 arranged<br>
in a vertical direction of the side surfaces 105 of the case<br>
102, as shown in Fig. 18.<br>
The electrical connection lines 60 leading from the high<br>
voltage transformer 50 pass through via holes 111 formed<br>
through a cover 103, each hole being provided with a<br>
protrusion 110. A bush 112 for protecting the corresponding<br>
electrical connection line 60 is inserted into the via holes<br>
111.<br>
The insides of the protrusions 110 are filled with an<br>
epoxy 113 so as to prevent the cooling oil 54 from flowing thereinto through the via holes 111 and the bushes 12.<br>
The bush 112 may be inserted into the via hole 111 from<br>
the inside of the protrusion 110 as shown in Fig. 11, or from<br>
the outside of the protrusion 110 as shown in Fig. 12.<br>
The case 102 and the base 101 of the container 51 are<br>
fixed to each other by tightly jointing the case 102 and the<br>
base 101 with each other and then by welding designated<br>
portions of the jointed case 102 and base 101 by brazing, arc<br>
welding, or electric welding.<br>
The high voltage transformer 50 is fixed to the base 101<br>
by argon welding the high voltage transformer 50 mounted on<br>
the base 101 via weld holes 115 formed through the base 101.<br>
The case 102 and the cover 103, and the case 102 and the<br>
base 101 are respectively fixed to each other by forming<br>
curling portions 116 on the upper end of the case 102 and the<br>
edge of the cover 103, and on the lower end of the case 102<br>
and the edge of the base 101, by engaging the curling portions<br>
116 with each other, and by pressing the engaged portions. In<br>
order to more firmly fix the case 102 and the cover 103, and<br>
the case 102 and the base 101 to each other, if necessary,<br>
after the pressing step, a welding step may be further<br>
performed.<br>
Instead of the auxiliary cooling means 80 for improving<br>
the cooling effect in the container 51 of the first<br>
embodiment, a plurality of heat pipes 120 for circulating a refrigerant introduced thereinto so as to cool the heat are<br>
installed in the container 51, thereby improving the cooling<br>
of the container 51.<br>
Preferably, radiation fins 121 are fixed to portions of<br>
the heat pipes 120 exposed to the outside, thereby improving<br>
the cooling effect.<br>
As described above, in the present invention, the high<br>
voltage transformer 50 is inserted into the container 51, the<br>
cooling oil 54 is injected into the container 51, and the<br>
container 51 is covered with the cover 52. Then, the<br>
container 51 incorporating the high voltage transformer 50 is<br>
installed in products such as microwave ovens.<br>
In accordance with the first embodiment, power is<br>
inputted to and outputted from the high voltage transformer 50<br>
so as to operate the high voltage transformer 50 via the<br>
terminals 61 provided on the upper part of the cover 52.<br>
In accordance with the second embodiment, the electrical<br>
connection lines 60 leading from the high voltage transformer<br>
50 and having a connection part at their ends are protruded<br>
from the cover 103 and exposed to the outside, thereby<br>
improving the connection of the high voltage transformer 59<br>
and an end product requiring the high voltage transformer 59.<br>
In case the electrical connection lines 60 are protruded<br>
from the cover 103 and are exposed to the outside, since the<br>
bushes 112 and epoxy 113 are used as means for preventing the<br>
cooling oil 54 from flowing thereinto through via holes 111<br>
formed through the cover 103, reduction of the cooling effect<br>
due to the leakage of the cooling oil 54 is prevented.<br>
The above-described high voltage transformer 50 of the<br>
present invention is installed on the end product. Then, the<br>
cooling oil 54 filling the interior of the container 51<br>
absorbs the heat of a high temperature generated from the coil<br>
56 and the core 57, and then conducts the absorbed heat to the<br>
container 51.<br>
The heat conducted to the container 51 is rapidly cooled<br>
by means of the heat exchange by the operation of the blast<br>
fan installed on the outside of the container 51.<br>
Particularly, since the interior of the container 51 is<br>
filled with the cooling oil 54, the cooling oil 54 reaches<br>
deep into the coil 56 and the core 57 so as to absorb the heat<br>
generated therefrom in operating the high voltage transformer<br>
50. In the first embodiment, the cooling effect is further<br>
improved by the auxiliary cooling means 80 such as the folds<br>
81 or the radiation fins 82 formed integrally with the<br>
container 51.<br>
In the second embodiment, when the cooling oil 54<br>
absorbing the heat conducted from the coil 56 and the core 57<br>
reaches the convex portions 107 of the corrugated portions 108<br>
formed on each side surface 105, outwardly protruding from the<br>
side surfaces 105, since the cooling oil 54 within the concave<br>
portions 107 are circulated by convection current, the cooling<br>
effect is further improved.<br>
Further, in case the heat pipes 120 serving as the<br>
auxiliary cooling means are fixed within the container 51 and<br>
partially protruded to the outside, since the protruded<br>
portions of the heat pipes 120 are rapidly cooled by the blast<br>
fan, the heat exchange between the protruded portions and<br>
internal portions of the heat pipes 120 is improved and the<br>
cooling effect is also improved.<br>
The fixing means 65 prevents the movement of the high<br>
voltage transformer 50 inserted into the container 51 due to<br>
the vibration generated in operating the high voltage<br>
transformer 50. Such function of the fixing means 65 will be<br>
described as follows.<br>
In the first embodiment, when the high voltage<br>
transformer 50 is mounted on the bottom 71 of the container 51<br>
by means of the lower guide 66 interposed between the bottom<br>
71 of the container 51 and the lower surface of the high<br>
voltage transformer 50, the lower and upper guides 66 and 67<br>
prevent the movement of the high voltage transformer 50, i.e.,<br>
fix the high voltage transformer, thereby allowing the cooling<br>
oil 54 to freely circulate in the space between the container<br>
51 and the fixed high voltage transformer 50.<br>
In the second embodiment, the high voltage transformer<br>
50 is fixed to the base 101 by welding the high voltage<br>
transformer 50 into the base 101 via the weld holes 115 formed<br>
through the base 101. Although the cooling device of the<br>
second embodiment does not have the lower and upper guides 66<br>
and 67, the movement of the high voltage transformer 50 due to<br>
the vibration generated in operating the high voltage<br>
transformer 50 is sufficiently prevented and simultaneously<br>
the high voltage transformer 50 is grounded.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, since the<br>
container 51 incorporating the high voltage transformer 50 is<br>
filled with the cooling oil 54 and sealed, the container 51<br>
maximizes its cooling effect, and reduces the size of the high voltage transformer 50 compared to a conventional high voltage<br>
transformer with the same capacity as the transformer 50 of<br>
the present invention.<br>
Further, since the high voltage transformer 50 is not<br>
exposed to the outside, the high voltage transformer 50 is not<br>
disclosed to high voltage in inspecting and repairing<br>
peripheral parts, thereby protecting users from dangers such<br>
as an electrical shock.<br>
As apparent from the above description, the present<br>
invention provides a method and a device for cooling a high<br>
voltage transformer for a microwave oven, in which the high<br>
voltage transformer is sealed so as to separate a coil and a<br>
core from the outside and to improve a cooling effect, and in<br>
which electric connection lines leading from the high voltage<br>
transformer are effectively treated and a fixed structure of a<br>
container for accommodating the high voltage transformer is<br>
improved so as to protect users of the high voltage<br>
transformer from dangers such as an electrical shock occurring<br>
in inspecting the microwave oven, thereby improving<br>
performance and quality of the microwave oven and the high<br>
voltage transformer.<br>
Although the preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention have been disclosed for illustrative purposes, those<br>
skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications, additions and substitutions are possible, without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention as disclosed in the<br>
