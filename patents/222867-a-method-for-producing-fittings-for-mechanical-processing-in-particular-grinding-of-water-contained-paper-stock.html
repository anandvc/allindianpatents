				<td>The Invention relates to a method for producing fittings for the mechanical<br>
processing in particular grinding of water-containing paper stock.<br>
Fittings produced in this way can serve in particular for grinding paper fibre,<br>
dispersing impurities, in the paper stock or deflaking, thus dissolving paper stock<br>
agglomerates. They are then used in grinding machines (refiners), deflakers or<br>
dispersers. Such machines have at least one rotor and at least one stator with<br>
either discoid or conical surfaces to which the fittings are attached, so that gaps<br>
can form between them. Many fittings have lands and grooves on the working<br>
surfaces, giving rise to what are called "blade fittings*. Other fittings, example as<br>
inserts in dispensers, have the form of toothed rings. OE 195 23 704 Al discloses<br>
and describes disperser fittings. It is known that, in addition to the form of the<br>
lands, grooves and teeth, the material of which they are produced also has an<br>
effect on the processing of the fibre.<br>
With mechanical processing using such fittings, the paper fibres are present in a<br>
pumpable suspension, that is with a solids content of approximately 2-6%, or as<br>
tough material with a solids content in excess of this, Dispersers generally work<br>
at a solids content of between 15 and 25%.<br>
The fittings are subjected to wear and must therefore be replaced at certain<br>
intervals. But even before this the wear can also leed to the processing effect<br>
changing, for form, in particular edge form, and surface of the fittings have an<br>
overwhelming influence on the processing effect. The disadvantage of these<br>
changes is that from a certain point of time onwards it is no longer possble for<br>
the same machine to operate optimally.<br>
It is therefore understandable that considerable costs art incurred for tht<br>
development of fittings, which is reflected in the configuration of its form and in<br>
the choice of material. It has been shown that materials which are particularly<br>
well suited for processing elements have properties which can prove highly<br>
problematic when used for the base body of the fittings. In particular, this relates<br>
to materials which are very hard and brittle and therefore do not exhibit the<br>
toughness required for the base body. Further, such materials are relatively<br>
expensive and complex to produce and can be processed only at considerable<br>
expense, compared with normal metallic materials.<br>
The base body of a processing tool produces the connection of the processing<br>
elements to the other components, example those of a grinding machine. Due to<br>
the high forces occurring in such a grinding machine, high strength demands are<br>
made on the base body. It must also be possible to attach it securely to the<br>
grinding machine, for which example highly braced screws are required. Because<br>
of these demands, a particularly solid and tough material is required.<br>
DE 196 03 548 A1 discloses a process for producing fittings, in which these are<br>
assembled from separately produced parts. According to this publication a high-<br>
temperature soldering process can be used under vacuum for this purpose.<br>
These well-suited processes are, however, expensive to carry out and do not<br>
always result in adequate strength.<br>
WO 99/37402 Al describes a process for producing refiner fittings, with which<br>
although it is possible for a different material to be selected for the blades than<br>
for the base plate. It is very expensive and complicated due to the plurality of<br>
individual components which have to be fitted together precisely.<br>
The object of the invention is to configure the process for producing fittings such<br>
that their production is made substantially easier, and yet particularly suitable<br>
hard materials can be used for highly stressed processing elements.<br>
The object is achieved by the features of the invention.<br>
The mask used for the process may consist of a metal sheet of uniform<br>
thickness, in which the openings have been produced by later cutting. In this<br>
case, it is quite possible to produce different openings for fittings with a different<br>
grinding effect, as per requirements. The outline contour of the mask can be<br>
somewhat smaller than that of the associated base body. The mask can easily be<br>
connected to the base body, example by welding seams In other cases prior to<br>
inserting the elements. Since the processing elements are first produced<br>
separately, it is possible to use optimal materials for these and in the process to<br>
create the form of the fitting relatively easily. Using the mask, there is the<br>
possiblity of positioning the processing elements precisely and securely at the<br>
current places on the base body and keeping them there during the subsequent<br>
procedural step. Since a relatively large number of processing elements is as a<br>
rule required for a fitting, it is useful to carry out inserting the elements into the<br>
mask with the aid of an automatically operating device. The advantage of the<br>
process is not only rapid execution and good automation, but it also offers very<br>
good strength, because the processing elements can be connected both to the<br>
base body and also to the mask. A high-temperature soldering process is<br>
particularly well suited to this, with which all the connections belonging to a<br>
processing unit can be readily produced at the same time. Such processes are<br>
mostly performed at very high temperature, example over 1000Â°C, preferably<br>
approximately 1050Â°C. Then a protective gat atmosphere, example argon, is<br>
advantageously used; a vacuum is also conceivable, though more expensive.<br>
It is also possible to solder not only tht procesting elements and mask together,-<br>
but in the same procedural step also the mask to the base body, which results in<br>
greater strength of the entire fitting.<br>
The expensive processing of the hard structures on the processing elements can<br>
often be omitted, since the precision of the fittings produced in this way is<br>
greater than example in conventional fittings, that is fully cast ones.<br>
The invention will now be explained by means of the accompanying drawings, in<br>
which:<br>
Figure 1 shows part of a grinding fitting in the production process according to<br>
the invention;<br>
Figure 2 shows part of grinding fitting on completion of the production process<br>
according to the invention;<br>
Figure 3 shows a spectral form of the processing elements;<br>
Figure 4 shows a 90Â° segment of a grinding fitting for disc refiners;<br>
Figure 5 shows part of a cone refiner provided with a grinding fitting;<br>
Figure 6 shows part of a disperser or deflating fitting produced according to the<br>
invention;<br>
Figure 7 shows a variant of tht fitting illustrated in Figure 6.<br>
Figure 1 shows a part of a base body 1, fitted with a mask 3, the connection<br>
being produced here by welding seams 7. The mask 3 is provided with a<br>
relatively large number of continuous openings 4. A processing element 5 is<br>
already inserted into the opening shown on the far left. The processing elements<br>
5 era strip-like and can produced axampla from roiled profiles. They have a<br>
surface which is constant over the height, which therefore also corresponds to<br>
that of the foot 6. The openings 4 and the form of the foot 6 match each other<br>
such that the processing element 5 can be inserted without play into the opening<br>
4. In typical cases, in which a high-temperature soldering process is carried out,<br>
the solder can already have been applied to the corresponding surfaces prior to<br>
inserting. Deposits of solder in the form of small depressions or grooves can be<br>
produced advantageously in the components to be connected (not shown here).<br>
The mask 3 can also be inserted, thus embedded, into a correspondingly formed<br>
base body.<br>
Figure 2, which illustrates Finished fitting 2 both in perspective and in section,<br>
shows that the soldering surface 9 (illustrated as bold lines) connects the<br>
processing elements 5 both to the base body 1 and to the mask 3. Because the<br>
stress of the fitting during operation can be relatively high, this large-surface<br>
connection offers a particular advantage. The soldering surface 9, here also<br>
extends over the contact surfaces between mask 3 and base body 1, which is<br>
however not always required and increases processing costs. The thickness c of<br>
the mask 3 is as a rule between 2 and 10 mm. The fitting 2 partially shown in<br>
Figure 2 can example be understood as a grinding segment (see Figure 4) for a<br>
disc refiner, which is known to contain a plurality of strip-like processing<br>
elements 5. Such fittings are also known as blade fittings. They are provided with<br>
screw holes 10 and are screwed on to the rotor or the stator of the disc refiner.<br>
These are known to be wearing parts, which therefore have to be renewed at<br>
certain intervals.<br>
Figure 3 shows a possible way of specially shaping the form of the processing<br>
elements 5, made easier by the process according to the invention. On the upper<br>
surface opposite the plane parallel to the direction of motion the leading edge of<br>
cut example in the rotor in the direction of motion (arrow 18) has an angle a of<br>
between 0 and 10Â° and on the front side opposite the plane perpendicular<br>
thereto has an angle y likewise of between 0 and 10Â°. This avoids unwanted<br>
edge rounding.<br>
It is also readily possible to apply the process according to the invention if a<br>
fitting for a cone refiner is to be produced. Then the base body 1', as shown in<br>
Figure 5, has the form of a truncated cone or a part thereof. This too can be<br>
provided with a mask 3, into which the processing elements 5 are to be inserted<br>
and fixed in the above described manner. From Figure 5 it is also evident that<br>
the fittings produced according to the process described can belong both to the<br>
rotor 11 and to the stator 12. In most refiners it is known for rotor and stator to<br>
be provided with blade fittings. The suspension 14 to be ground ii fed in<br>
between the blades through the machine. The rotor 11 is driven by the shaft 13.<br>
There are also applications in the field of dispersing and deflating of paper stock<br>
in which fitting* are used which are provided with highly stressed toothed<br>
processing elements. Here too, the process according to tht invention can be<br>
applied. Figures 6 and 7 accordingly each show a base body 1 with a mask 3<br>
placed thereon and a number of already inserted processing elements. Several<br>
different tooth forms an illustrated by way of example, example single cubic<br>
teeth 15 of chamfered teeth 16, which act as processing elements in the context<br>
of the invention. It should optionally be weighed up as to whether a relatively<br>
large number of simply formed, easy-to-produce individual teeth is used, or<br>
whether several teeth are to be combined into larger or smaller teeth groups 17,<br>
17' and then inserted into the mask 3. The production of such a fitting is similar,<br>
as already described, that is the feet of the processing elements 5', thus the<br>
teeth or teeth groups, and the openings in the mask 3 have approximately the<br>
same form, so that the processing elements 5' can be inserted. Next again<br>
comes the final fixing of the processing elements with the mask 3 and the base<br>
bodyl.<br>
Hard brittle metal alloys which have been optimized for fibre processing can be<br>
used as material for the processing elements. They can also be hardened either<br>
after the high-temperature soldering or during that process. For example, after<br>
high-temperature soldering cooling can be performed so rapidly that the<br>
processing elements harden thermally with use of carbon steels.<br>
The base body may be made of relatively tough Cr-Ni steel. S9ince it is covered<br>
up to the paper stock suspension by the mask and processing elements, it can<br>
also be made of non-corrosion resistance steel farther reducing costs. A further<br>
possibility is the coating of the base body with corrosion-resistant material.<br>
The mask can be produced advantageously from relatively tough Cr-Ni steel<br>
sheet, in which the openings have been produced by laser cutting.<br>
