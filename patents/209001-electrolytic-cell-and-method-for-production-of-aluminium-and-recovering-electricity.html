Title of Invention<br>
Electrolytic cell for the production of aluminium and a method for maintaining a crust on a sidewall and for recovering electricity.<br>
Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an electrotytic cell for time production of aluminium, a motion for maintaining a cost on the sidewalk of an electrolytic cell for producing aluminum and a method for recovering electricity from an electrolytic cell for producing aluminum.<br>
Background Art<br>
Aluminium is produced in electrolytic cells comprising an electrolytic tank having a cathode and an anode which is either a   anode or a plurality of prefaced carbon anodes. Aluminum oaken is supplied to a cryolite-based bath in which the aluminum   is dissolved. During the eledrolytic process aluminum is produced at the cathode and fonn a molten aluminum layer on the bottom of the electrolytic tank with the crinoline bath floating on the top of the aluminum layer. CO-gas Is produced at the anode causing consumption of the anode. The operating temperature of the cryolite batik Is normally in the range of about 920 to about 950 <br><br>
The electrolytic tank consists of an outer steel shell having cart  blocks in the bottom. The blocks are connected to electrical busbars whereby time cart  blocks function as a cathode. The sidewalls of the electrolytic tank are generally lined with refractory material against tie steel shell, and a layer of caisson blocks or   paste Is formed on the inset of tie refractory material. There BTB several types of lining materials and ways of nagging the sidewalk lining.<br>
During the operation of the electrolytic cell, a crust or ledge of frozen bath funs on the sidewalls of time electrolytic tank. This layer may, during operation of time electrolytic cell, vary in thickness. The formation of this crust and its thickness are critical to time operation of time cell. If Vane crust becomes too thick. it will disturb the operation of the cell as the temperature of the bath near the walls becomes cooler than the temperature in the bulk of the bath,<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Cells, and more preferably to the heat exchangers 14 for all electrolytic cells in a plotline. This is Indicated in figure 2 where there is shown a second heat exchanger 14Afbr a second electrolytic cell.<br>
The electricity produced in generator 20 results in a substantial reduction of the effective energy consumed in the electrolytic cell per ton-produced aluminum.<br><br>
The second closed loop 18 has a pump 22 for circulating the florid cooling medium and a conventional bleed arrangement 23.<br>
As noted above, it is prefenred that the majority of parts of the first closed loop 10 and the heat exchanger 14 are arranged in the heat resistant and heat insulating material 6. This prefenred embodiment Is Illustrated in Figure 3 wherein each electrolytic tank has an inlet and an outlet for connecting the piping of the second closed loop 18. The outflow pipe 10A and inflow pipe ' 10B of the first dosed loop 10, as well as the portion of pipe IOC in the upper part 9 of evaporation cooled panel 7, are as shown. These connectors allow the third cooling medium to circulate through the heat exchanger 14. A crust 24 of frozen bath is then formed on the sidewise of the cell.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
