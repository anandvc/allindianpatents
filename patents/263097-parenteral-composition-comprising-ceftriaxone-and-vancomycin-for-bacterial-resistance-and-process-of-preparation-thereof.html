				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition as a method of treatment of non-ocular infective conditions for use against multi drug resistant bacteria. The particular of the invention discloses a pharmaceutical composition containing two different antibiotics, a glycopeptide and a cephalosporin, combined with the help of at least one solublizing/stabilizing agent and is present in dry powder form. The method of treatment disclosed by the invention follows a parenteral route of administration after reconstitution with a suitable solvent.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Use of antibacterial agents has grown rapidly over the past few years and so has the resistance of bacterial strains to antibiotics that use these agents as detailed by Sharma Rashmi et al; Indian J Med Sci 2005 in their article:" Antibacterial resistance: Current problems and possible solutions". New range of bacterial strains that are resistant to multiple drugs has also evolved.<br>
Penicillin, which is the first known antibiotic, has exhibited an excellent efficacy toward Staphylococci. However, penicillin resistant bacteria that degrade penicillin, emerged with the period of time. Research and development of penicillinase resistant penicillins (PRP) such as methicillin and cephems antibiotics provided solutions in clinical aspects to many problems posed by the penicillin resistant bacteria.<br>
However, in recent years, as a result of overuse and misuse of third-generation cephem antibiotics, which have weak antibacterial potency on Staphylococci and which are resistant to these antibiotics have selectively proliferated. Such bacteria have come to spread in hospitals, leading to rise in number of cases of hospital acquired infections. In particular, methicillin-resistant Staphalococcus aureus bacteria, commonly known as MRSA, has emerged, against which all known beta-lactam agents are ineffective. MRSA is an example of multiple-drug-<br>
resistant bacteria that are broadly resistant to not only penicillin antibiotics but also cephem antibiotics and aminoglycoside antibiotics individually. Examples of currently used antibiotics against MRSA infections include formulations containing glycopeptides such as vancomycin<br>
(VCM).<br>
However, VCM is involved in resistance to bacteria such as MRSA as discussed in 'Emergence of low level vancomycin resistance in MRSA' by Assadullah S et al 2003. In addition, combinations of multiple antibiotics have been conventionally investigated aiming at the enhancement of antibacterial potency in an article 'Re-emerging Staphylococci Infections' by Barry Kreiswirth. Therefore, there exists an urgent need to the development of novel antibacterial combination drugs which are effective on resistant bacteria and can act synergistically as is done in the invention.<br>
There have been many attempts to combat broad-spectrum gram negative and gram positive bacteria. These include administration of multiple antibacterial agents such as vancomycin and ceftriaxone. Ceftriaxone is less active against gram positive cocci than first generation cephalosporin. However, it is markedly active against gram negative bacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae including beta lactamase producing strains and penicillin resistant strains such as Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeaea and N. meningitis. It is also active against Staphylococcus aureus including penicillinase producing strains but not against mcthicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Whereas vancomycin acts against variety of gram positive bacteria including methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staph, epidermidis, Vancomycin shows high level acquired transferable resistance against Enterococci which appears to be plasmid mediated.<br>
The use of multiple antibacterial agents for prevention and treatment of a variety of infectious disease states are found to be synergistic in vitro .Ribes S et al J Antimicrob Chemother 2005 in their article explained that an additive effect was observed when combinations of ceftriaxone plus vancomycin were studied at sub inhibitory concentrations.<br>
The emergence of multidrug-resistant pneumococci and, more recently, of pneumococci tolerant to vancomycin are important public health concerns worldwide (Henriques Normark et al, Clin. Infect. Dis. 2001; Novak, R, Nature 1999; R. M. Atkinson et al 40th Intersci. Cost. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother., 2000; A. Marchese, et al 40th Intersci. Conf. Antimicroo. Agents Chemother., 2000).<br>
Various earlier investigations show that combination of vancomycin and ceftriaxone is more active against bacteria than monotherapy alone against commonly encounterd pathogens in bacterial meningitis. Violeta Rodriguez-Cerrato, Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2003 ;the aims of their study were to assess the bacteriologic effectiveness of these agents against experimental meningitis caused by vancomycin tolerant pneumococci and to compare the results with those obtained by conventional therapy with vancomycin and ceftriaxone in combination.<br>
'Rifampicin+ceftriaxone versus vancomycin+ceftriaxone in the treatment of penicillin- and cephalosporin-resistant pneumococcal meningitis in an experimental rabbit model' by Suntur BM et al in Int J Antimicrob Agents. 2005 found Ceftriaxone+rifampicin was as effective as ceftriaxone+vancomycin.<br>
Kaplan SL (2002) found that ceftriaxone and vancomycin are useful in the treatment and management of pneumococcal meningitis. Kaplan mentions that the standard empiric therapy for suspected bacterial meningitis for infants and children older than 1 month of age is the combination of cefotaxime or ceftriaxone and vancomycin. Treatment is modified after antimicrobial susceptibilities are available.<br>
Jaing, TH, et al, in their 2002 publication reported a treatment of meningitis caused by highly-penicillin-resistant Streptococcus mitis in a leukemic child. The paper reported the case of a patient that was successfully treated with a combination of vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor.<br>
Cottangnoud P et. al. (2002) found that in experimental rabbit meningitis, cefepime given at a<br>
dose of 100 mg/kg was associated with concentrations in the cerebrospinal' fluid of between 5.3 and 10 mg/L and a bactericidal activity of -0.61 +/- 0.24 Delta log(10) cfu/mL x h, similar to the standard regimen of ceftriaxone combined with vancomycin (-0.58 +/- 0.14 Delta log( 10) cfu/mL x h) in the treatment of meningitis due to a penicillin- and quinolone-resistant pneumococcal mutant strain (MIC 4 mg/L).<br>
Banon et. al.(2001) worked on time-kill evaluation in Spain. In this study the bactericidal activity of four antimicrobial regimens against ten clinical isolates of S. pneumoniae (five with an intermediate resistance to penicillin and five highly resistant ones), was determined by means of kill kinetics studies using either penicillin, or ceftriaxone, in combination with vancomycin, or fosfomycin.<br>
Desbiolles et. al(2001) worked on fractional maximal effect method for in vitro synergy between amoxicillin and ceftriaxone, and between vancomycin and ceftriaxone, against Enterococcus faecalis and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. They reported an assessment of the use of a new in vitro testing method and graphical representation of the results to investigate the potential effectiveness of combinations of amoxicillin (AMZ) plus ceftriaxone (CRO), and of CRO plus vancomycin (VAN) against strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRP strains) highly resistant to penicillin and cephalosporins. Consequently, either of the combinations was proposed for use for the treatment of PRP infections.<br>
Huebner et. al.(2000) reported that ceftriaxone or cefotaxime should be used in combination with vancomycin for the treatment of meningitis until a cephalosporin-resistant pneumococcal cause is excluded.<br>
Roos (1999) studied bacterial meningitis therapy using a combination of third generation cephalosporins and vancomycin. He has suggested that initial empiric therapy for community-acquired bacterial meningitis should be based on the possibility that penicillin-resistant pneumococci may be the etiologic organisms and, hence, should include a combination of<br>
third-generation cephalosporin (cefotaxime or ceftriaxone) and vancomycin.<br>
Climo et. al.,1999 found that combinations of vancomycin and beta-lactams are synergistic against staphylococci with reduced susceptibilities to vancomycin. . Evidence of synergism between combinations multiple antibacterial agents such as vancomycin and cephalosporins against 59 isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococci (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus haemolyticus) was collected . They concludec that the combination of vancomycin and beta-lactams with antistaphylococcal activity is ar effective regiment for the treatment of infections with clinical strains of staphylococci which demonstrate reduced susceptibility to glycopep tides. In a study of antimicrobial resistance of invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae in Slovenia, 1993-1995, Cizman M et. al. (1997) found that all penicillin-resistant isolates (intermediate resistance) were susceptible to cefotaxime, ceftriaxone and vancomycin.<br>
DISADVANTAGES OF PRIOR ART<br>
One feature of the references stated above is that each drug of the combination used in the multiple antibacterial agent treatments reported therein was individually administered one after the other without specific or predetermined ratio. Such administration and also the coadministration as mentioned in case of some of the above references have a number of disadvantages. These are as stated here:<br>
l.Drugs mentioned as the combinations used in the multiple drug treatment are administered one after the other.<br>
2. These drugs are not available in a premixed compositions as single drug.<br>
3.There is complexity involved in administration of the drug as more number of pricks is required and the time of administration is also long.<br>
4.Treatment time is prolonged to about 14 days in case of individual administration of these drugs and to about 7 days in case of co-administration of the composition of invention.<br>
5.Cost to the patient is higher due to increased hospitalization time.<br>
6.The failure rate is higher due to inconsistency of dose. Kazragis et al (1996) have giver ceftriaxone at a dose of 25 mg/kg of body weight administered every 12 h and Vancomycin at 30 mg/kg administered every 12 h; Ulla-Stina Salminen et.al.(1999) have given 2 g dosage of ceftriaxone and 500 mg of vancomycin iv every 6 h for 48 h.<br>
7. Due to non availability of fixed dose at fixed intervals, chances of development of resistance are very high in case of prior art.<br>
The individual administration of the Ceftriaxone and vancomycin components of drugs described in the prior art fails to solve the treatment problem satisfactorily because of following: reasons:<br>
1.	The   components   are   administered   one   after   the   other   and   individually   in different doses,<br>
2.	The    components    are    administered    either    in    equal    proportions    or    the ratio is undefined and not fixed.<br>
3.	The success rate of such a treatment is not as per the desired levels.<br>
4.	Use of oral route with parenteral route is adopted in some cases,(e). Co-administration has    to    be    done    very    carefully    as    two    individual    components    are chemically compatible with each other, (f). Due to incompatibility of individual components	more	precautions	are	required	to taken like use of different syringes for individual component and difference in time of administration of two drugs.<br>
ADVANTAGES OF INVENTION<br>
 An essential requirement for successful antibacterial therapy is that drug must reach a<br>
site of infection at concentrations near or higher than the minimal inhibitory concentrations. Furthermore, these concentrations must be maintained for a certain minimal time as achieved by the composition of invention. The differences in the ability of various antibacterial agents to reach site of infection sometimes have greater influence on determining the agent for treatment than the differences in the agents' intrinsic antibacterial activity.<br>
Parenteral administration is generally the preferred method of drug delivery in emergency situations, and is also useful in treating subjects with digestive tract illnesses or swallowing difficulties, as well as subjects who are uncooperative, unconscious, or otherwise unable or unwilling to accept oral medication. Moreover, parenteral routes of administration offer numerous benefits over oral delivery in many situations, for a wide variety of drugs. One advantage of parenteral administration is that therapeutically effective blood serum concentrations of the drug are achieved in a shorter time than is achievable by other routes of administration. This results in more rapid onset o' therapeutic action and more complete delivery to a site of infection, as compared with othe-routes of administration such as oral, transmucosal, transdermal, rectal and vaginal routes. This is especially true of intravenous injection, whereby the drug is placed directly in the bloodstream. Hence the present invention is developed in parenteral form only.<br>
Parenteral administration can also result in more predictable blood serum concentrations of a drug than oral administration. This is because losses in the gastrointestinal tract due to metabolism, partial or total degradation of the drug, binding to food, and other causes are. eliminated. In addition, the effective use of some antibacterial agents requires continuous controlled administration to achieve the desired effect.<br>
Another aspect of parenteral drug theory that has been considered hitherto is that are<br>
parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter/precipitation and discoloration prior to administration, whenever possible. Although existing individua formulations exhibit satisfactory clarity when prepared in accordance with recommenoec manufacturer's instructions, it is mandatory to further reduce and minimize the particulas formations/ precipitations that occur in the combining pharmaceutical compositions reconstitution as is done in prior art. The above mentioned prior art references disclose a number of useful compositions. However, there still exists a need in the medical field for pharmaceutical compositions that use multiple antibacterial agents and also for methods of treatment and prevention for infective conditions, using such compositions that:<br>
(a)ensure rapid delivery of therapeutic agent(s) to the site of an infective condition,<br>
(b)are safe and chemically compatible to each other<br>
(c)can be administered easily without posing any medical hazard,<br>
(d)provide effective treatment of the hospitalised patient for the treatment of bacterial infections and other complications associated with a non-ocular infective condition, (e)provide efficacy against a wide variety of infectious organisms, (f)have a potential to administer a lower dose of a therapeutic agent while still providing efficacy, and<br>
(g)have a potential to administer a higher dose of an antibacterial agent without<br>
increased<br>
side effects.<br>
(h) ensure improvement of the therapeutic index of an active agent while decreasing its general toxicity and minimizing the risk of systemic effects.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Accordingly, the objects of the present invention are described as below: An object of the present invention is to provide pharmaceutical compositions that are safe, that have efficacy against a wide variety of infectious organisms, and to provide a composition that is useful in providing effective treatment against non-ocular infective conditions of a multi drug resistant bacteria.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a method of treatment of non-ocular infective conditions that ensures rapid therapeutic delivery of therapeutic agent(s) to the site of the infective condition.<br>
Further object of the present invention is to provide pharmaceutic ally effective dose for<br>
parenteral administration for hospitalized patients with acute or serious non-ocular<br>
infections.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide dosage forms that have a<br>
potential to provide effective treatment without increased side effects.<br>
A further objective of the present invention is to provide a process of making pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention.<br>
A still further objective of the present invention is to provide a chemically compatible stable formulation that is easy to administer.<br>

The inventors have found that this composition advantageously overcomes the bacteria resistance that is experienced by the monotherapy described in the prior art. They have discovered that the glycopeptide component of the composition of the present inventio-provides a bactericidal action against a variety of gram positive bacteria, whereas the cephalosporin elements exhibit a high degree of stability in the presence of beta-lactamases of both gram positive and gram negative bacteria.<br>
The present invention also provides a novel method of treatment of non-ocular infective conditions. The method comprises administering to a subject, by parenteral administration, the composition described in the preferred embodiment in combination therapy with a suitable solvent vehide. The combination therapy thus described is administered to a subject who has clinical signs of an infective condition. Parenteral methods of administration are an important option for delivery of therapeutic agents<br>
especially for drugs like vancomycin which are poorly absorbed when administered orally, and to which bacterial resistance tends to develop in gastrointestinal tract. Ceftriaxone is also administered through intravenous route effectively.<br>
Combination therapy refers to a treatment regimen wherein the two antibacterial agents are administered together in such a way as to provide a beneficial effect from co-action of these therapeutic agents. Such beneficial effect can include, but is not limited to, pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic co-action of the therapeutic agents. Combination therapy, for example, results in lowering the dosage of one or both agents than would normally be administered during monotherapy described in the prior art, thus decreasing risk or incidence of adverse effects associated with higher doses. Alternatively, combination therapy also results in increased therapeutic effect at the normal dose of each agent in monotherapy. Furthermore, combination therapy maximizes the therapeutic effect.<br>

They have also found that when administered intravenously, the combination therapy of the invention provides enhanced treatment options as compared to administration of either the antibacterial agent.<br>
Combination therapy according to the invention provides effective treatment of an<br>
infective condition, and reduces the time required to resolve the infective condition<br>
caused by bactena particularly the multi-drug-resistant varieties such as MRSA and<br>
Staphylococcal species. It is found by the inventors that the method of treatment<br>
disclosed  in  this  invention  also  reduces:   the  risk  of developing  such  infective<br>
conditions. Therefore the combination therapy as described herein can be administered<br>
prior to or following surgery or hospital admission prevent or reduce the risk of a<br>
subject developing an infection caused mainly by MRSA and Staphylococcal species.<br>
