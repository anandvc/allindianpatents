				<td>The invention relates to a dust an-sting attachment device for a vacuum deanery.<br>
The basic function of a vacuum cleaner iÂ« collection, catchments and disposal of dust by the action of moving air. The prime mover of the vacuum cleaner drives a centrifugal fan, which generates a suction pressure, creating a strong stream of air. The airflow is used to dfsptace the dust from a given surface. The displaced dust is carried by the air into the body parts of the vacuum cleaner. The dust-laden air is normally filtered to separate dust from air and the filtered air is released back in to the surroundings. The dust collected by the filter or a bank of filters will be disposed safely, hygienbally and conveniently using paper bags or doth dust bags. This method of air filtration has the folk wing disadvantages.<br>
a) Filters offer resistance to airflow.<br><br>
b)	The pores of filters get clogged by the incoming dust further increasing the resistance to airflow.<br>
c)	Larger particles can block the pores and reduce effective area of the fitter.<br>
d) The cumulative effect of the above would be to lower efficiency of vacuum cleaner due to restrictions on air flow.<br>
e) Due to reduction in airflow, the speed of vacuum cleaner motor increases resulting in below optimum perfonnance.<br>
The dust arresting attachment device according to the invention provkJes a solution to overcome the abovementioned dissadvantages by attaching it to the suction line of a vacuum cleaner.<br>
The invention provides a dust arresting attachment device for a vacuum cleaner, said device comprising an elongated dust collecting<br><br>
bowl for collecting heavier dust particles received from the suction tube of a vacuum deaner, an elongated hollow filter extendirig into the dust collecting bowl forming a conduit with space between a filtering surface all around the elongated surfece and the wall of the dust collecting bowl, a dust arrestor cap which closes the end of the filter extending into the said dust collecting t&gt;owl, the other end of the fitter being seailngly attached to a cover assembly having an inlet and outlet said cover assembly being attachable to suction hose of the vacuum cleaner to allow the sucked air to enter the said inlet and exit through the saki outlet provided in the sakl cover assembly, after perfonning cyclonk; separation of heavy dust particles.<br>
The dust arresting attachment device according to the invention is attachable to the suction of the vacuum cleaner at the position of the suction hose upstream of the floor brush. The device according to the invention employs a construction in which relatively heavier dust partk^les are trapped in a dust-collecting bowl by cydonk: separatk&gt;n.<br><br>
The dust arresting attachment device according to the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
Figure 1 shows a preferred embodiment of the attachment device according to the invention.<br>
Figure 2 shows a blown up view of a preferred embodiment of the dust device shown in figure 1.<br>
Figure 3 shows a vacuum cleaner attached with a dust arresting attachment device according to the invention.<br>
The dust arresting attachment device according to the invention comprises an elongated dust collecting bow) (9) with a cover assembly having an inlet (10) and outlet (11) for attaching to the suction line of a vacuum deaner. Preferably the cover assembly comprises a top cover (1) and a bottom cover (3) with a center partition (2) assembled together to provide an airtight cover for the<br><br>
open end of the dust coHecting bowl (9). The center partition (2) Is provided with an opening (12) and an elongated hollow filter (7) with an filtering surface all around the elongated surface (6) is sealingly attached to the center partition (2) so that the filtered air entering the hollow portion of the filter (7) through elongated filtering surface is passed to the outlet (11) in the top cover (10). The end of the elongated fitter (6) extending into the dust collecting bowl (9) is provided with a dust arrestor cap (8). The sucked air entering the conduit t&gt;etween the inner wall of the dust collecting bowl (9) and the outer surface of the fitter (6) through the inlet (10) undergoes a cyclonic motion whk^ separates the heavier dust particles in the dust lader air sucked in and traps it in the dust collecting bow) (9). The air passing through the elongated fitter surface (7) ar&gt;d entering the inskle the hollow fitter will have only very fine dust. Thus the air reaching the vacuum clean cleaner dust collection bag will not have heavier dust partk^les whk^ clogs the holes of the collection bag. Separation of heavier partk^les form the sucked air is achieved without substantially reducir^g the efficier&gt;cy of the vacuum cleaner.<br><br>
The top cover (1), the center partition (2) and the bottom cover (3) are assembled by means of any suitable fixing means (4). Preferably a washer (5) is provided between the edge of surface of the dust collecting bowl (9) and the edge surface of the bottom cover to obtain a air tight seal at the joint between cover assembly and the dust collecting bowl (9). The dust collecting bowl is preferably made of clear polycarbone wHh a elongated portion and round bottom providing a gentle conical shape. The elongated portion is provided with a slight taper along the axis to provide a conical bowl having a smaller diameter at the bottom than the diameter at the end joining the cover assembly.<br>
The prime mover of the vacuum cleaner creates suction pressure at the main dust receptacle. This creates a strong stream of air through the floor nozzle or any applied accessory at the hose end of the vacuum cleaner. This aerodynamic force of the working air dislodges the dust on the surface to be cleaned. The dust-laden air passes through the nozzle, then through the extension tube and enters the<br><br>
device. The dust-laden air is made to pass over a special conduit such that a tangential force is created on the air stream. This causes a centrifugal force to be generated on the dust particles by whirling action.<br>
The dust arresting attachment device may be attached at any portion of the suction line. It is ideally located immediately after the suction nozzle so that the suction nozzle is connected to the hose through the device.<br><br><br>

1. A dust arresting attachment device for a vacuum cleaner, said device comprising an elongated dust collecting bowl (9) for collecting heavier dust particles received from the suction tube of a vacuum cleaner , an elongated hollow filter (6) extending into the dust collecting bowl (9) forming a conduit with space between a filtering surface (7) all around the elongated surface and the wall of the dust collecting bowl (9), a dust arrestor cap (8) which doses the end of the filter extending into the said dust collecting bowl (9), the other end of the filter being sealingly attached to a cover assembly {1, 2, 3) having an inlet (10) and outlet (11) said cover assembly being attachable to suction hose of the vacuum cleaner to allow the sucked air to enter the said inlet (10) and exit through the said outlet (11) provided in the said cover assembly after performing cyclonic separation of heavy dust particles.<br><br>
