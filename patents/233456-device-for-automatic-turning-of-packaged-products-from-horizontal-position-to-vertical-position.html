COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See section 10; Rule 13)<br>
"DEVICE FOR AUTOMATIC TURNING OF SACHET STRINGS FROM HORIZONTAL POSITION TO VERTICAL POSITION"<br>
1 8 MAY 2004<br>
MULTI PACK SYSTEMS PVT. LTD., an Indian Company of 2,ld Floor, Paqtriot Complex, Ellora Park, Baroda, Gujarat 390 007, India.<br>
The following specification (particularly) describe the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
DEVICE FOR AUTOMATIC TURNING OF SACHET STRINGS FROM HORIZONTAL POSITION TO VERTICAL POSITION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a device for automatic turning of packaged products from horizontal position to a vertical position. More particularly, the present invention relates to a device for turning sachets arriving in horizontal position on a flat conveyor belt to a vertical position for being placed on an in-feed conveyor of flow wrap machine.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
To the best of the Applicants knowledge, there is no automatic device developed so far for the purpose of turning sachets strings arriving in horizontal position on a flat conveyor belt to a vertical position.<br>
As present, the turning of the sachet strings is done manually. The existing mechanism of manual turning of sachet strings is depicted in Figure 1 and the working of the device is described here below.<br>
Multiple rows of sachet strings in horizontal position arrive on single flat conveyor belt. Workmen standing along the flow direction of the sachet strings manually turn the sachet strings and place them in a vertical position on the conveyor belt. Due to involvement of human labor, the process of packaging the product is slow. Thus is a need to automate the process of turning the sachet strings from horizontal position to vertical position.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a device for automatic turning of packaged products from horizontal position to a vertical position.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a device for transferring sachets arriving in horizontal position on a flat conveyor belt to a vertical position for being placed on an in-feed conveyor of flow wrap machine.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a device for turning packaged products arriving in-a horizontal position on a flat conveyor belt to a vertical position for being placed on an in-feed conveyor of flow wrap machine.<br>
2<br><br>
STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a device for automatic turning packaged products from horizontal position to a vertical position, said device comprising a flat conveyor belt carrying the packaged products in a horizontal position and one or more twist product guides mounted on the flat conveyor belt, such that the twist product guides progressively turns the sachet strings from horizontal to vertical position, wherein the twist product guide comprises a means for guiding an incoming sachet string to a sachet mounting portion, wherein the sachet mounting portion is preferably in the form of a flat platform for facilitating an end of the sachet string to mount on to a ramp portion, said ramp portion being suffixed by a tilting portion to tilt / turn the sachet coming on the ramp progressively from horizontal position to vertical position such that at the end of the tilting portion, the sachet string acquires right vertical position and a stabilizing portion optionally being provided after the turning portion to prevent falling down of the sachet.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
In the drawings accompanying the specification,<br>
Figure 1 represents the prior art method for turning sachets.<br>
Figure 2 represents the device developed in accordance with the present invention.<br>
Figure 3 represents the working of the device of the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>

In an embodiment of the present invention, the device of the present invention comprises of one or more twist (rotate) product guides to be mounted on the flat conveyor belt such that the twist (rotate) product guides progressively turns the sachet strings from horizontal to vertical position.<br>
3<br><br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the conveyor belt comprises of one or more strip belts.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, conveyor belt carries one or more sachet strings at the same time.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the number of sachet strings carried by the conveyor belt at a given time is equal to or less than the number of strip belts on the conveyor belt.<br>
In one more embodiment of the present invention, the number of twist (rotate) product guides mounted on the conveyor belt is equal to or less than the number of strip belts on the conveyor belt.<br>
In one another embodiment of the present invention, the twist (rotate) product guide comprises of a means for guiding the incoming sachet strings to a sachet mounting portion, wherein the sachet mounting portion is preferably in the form of a flat platform for facilitating an end of the sachet string to mount on to a ramp portion, said ramp portion being suffixed by a means to tilt the sachet progressively to turn the sachets coming on the ramp from a horizontal position to a vertical position such that at the end of the turning portion, the sachet string acquires right vertical position and a stabilizing portion optionally being provided after the turning portion to prevent falling down of the sachet.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the device is located on the conveyor such that it is located at one side of the path of the product in the conveyor belt.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the device is located at the path of the product in the conveyor belt so as to provide sufficient space for the product standing vertically to pass further in the same vertical position.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the rod has a diameter in the range of 3 to 6 mm.<br>
4<br><br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the rod has a diameter of 5 mm.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the length of the rod is in the range of 100 to 300 mm.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the height of the sachet mounting portion is equal to the diameter of the rod.<br>
In one more embodiment of the present invention, height of the sachet mounting portion is 5 mm.<br>
In one another embodiment of the present invention, the angle of inclination of the ramp is in the range of 5° to 75°.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the ramp portion increases the height of the sachet string from 5 mm to 40 mm.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the turning portion is being formed by a wedge.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the wedge can be placed on or after the ramp portion.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the stabilizing portion supports the turned sachets thereby preventing them from falling down.<br>
In one more embodiment of the present invention, the width of the twist (rotate) product guide may be in the range of 5 mm to 20 mm.<br>
In one another embodiment of the present invention, the length of the twist (rotate) product guide may be in the range of 300 to 800 mm. .<br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention, the width of the sachet string is greater than the width of the twist (rotate) product guide.<br>
5<br><br>
WORKING OF THE NEWLY DEVELOPED MECHANISM FOR AUTOMATIC TURNING OF SACHET STRINGS<br>
The device of the present invention works as follows:<br>
Multiple rows of sachet strings arrive from single belt conveyor onto automatic sachet strings turning device. There are multiple rows of strip belts on the turning device. Each belt carries individual sachet string and transfers the same from one end of the device to the other.<br>
The Applicants have now designed special profile of twist product guides, which are mounted above strip belts on turning device. The sachets strings which are transferred by strip belts are guided by these guides.<br>
The design of the profile of guides is made such that during travel of sachets strings, the guides progressively turn them from the horizontal position to vertical position. At the end of the guide, the strings acquire right vertical position.<br>
The workman standing near the turning device then manually places the strings on the in feed conveyor of flow wrap machine.<br>
