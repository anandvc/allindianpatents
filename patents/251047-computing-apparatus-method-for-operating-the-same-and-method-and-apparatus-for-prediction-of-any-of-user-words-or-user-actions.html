BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The invention relates to user entry of information into a system with an input device. More<br>
particularly, the invention relates to contextual prediction of intended user inputs and<br>
actions.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
For many years, portable computers have been getting smaller and smaller. The principal<br>
size-limiting component in the effort to produce a smaller portable computer has been the<br>
keyboard. If standard typewriter-size keys are used, the portable computer must be at<br>
least as large as the keyboard. Miniature keyboards have been used on portable<br>
computers, but the miniature keyboard keys have been found to be too small to be easily<br>
or quickly manipulated by a user. Incorporating a full-size keyboard in a portable computer<br>
also hinders true portable use of the computer. Most portable computers cannot be<br>
operated without placing the computer on a flat work surface to allow the user to type with<br>
both hands. A user cannot easily use a portable computer while standing or moving.<br><br><br>
In the latest generation of small portable computers, called Personal Digital<br>
Assistants (PDAs), companies have attempted to address this problem by<br>
incorporating handwriting recognition software in the PDA. A user may directly enter<br>
text by writing on a touch-sensitive panel or screen. This handwritten text is then<br>
converted by the recognition software into digital data. Unfortunately, in addition to<br>
the fact that printing or writing with a pen is in general slower than typing, the<br>
accuracy and speed of the handwriting recognition software has to date been less<br>
than satisfactory. Also, there are memory constraints. Recognition software often<br>
needs more memory than is available on the device. This is especially true with<br>
such devices as mobile telephones.<br>
Presently, a tremendous growth in the wireless industry has spawned reliable,<br>
convenient, and very popular mobile communications devices available to the<br>
average consumer, such as cell phones, two-way pagers, PDAs, etc. These<br>
handheld wireless communications and computing devices requiring text input are<br>
becoming smaller still. Recent advances in two-way paging, cellular telephones,<br>
and other portable wireless technologies have led to a demand for small and<br>
portable two-way messaging systems, and especially for systems which can both<br>
send and receive electronic mail ("e-mail"). Some wireless communications device<br>
manufacturers also desire to provide to consumers devices with which the consumer<br>
can operate with the same hand that is holding the device.<br>
Disambiguation Background<br><br>
Prior development work has considered use of a keyboard that has a reduced<br>
number of keys. As suggested by the keypad layout of a touch-tone telephone,<br>
many of the reduced keyboards have used a 3-by-4 array of keys. Each key in the<br>
array of keys contains multiple characters. There is therefore ambiguity as a user<br>
enters a sequence of keys, since each keystroke may indicate one of several letters.<br>
Several approaches have been suggested for resolving the ambiguity of the<br>
keystroke sequence, referred to as disambiguation.<br>
One suggested approach for unambiguously specifying characters entered on a<br>
reduced keyboard requires the user to enter, on average, two or more keystrokes to<br>
specify each letter. The keystrokes may be entered either simultaneously (chording)<br>
or in sequence (multiple-stroke specification). Neither chording nor multiple-stroke<br>
specification has produced a keyboard having adequate simplicity and efficiency of<br>
use. Multiple-stroke specification is inefficient, and chording is complicated to learn<br>
and use.<br>
Other suggested approaches for determining the correct character sequence that<br>
corresponds to an ambiguous keystroke sequence are summarized in the article<br>
"Probabilistic Character Disambiguation for Reduced Keyboards Using Small Text<br>
Samples," published in the Journal of the International Society for Augmentative and<br>
Alternative Communication by John L. Arnott and Muhammad Y. Javad (hereinafter<br>
the "Arnott article"). The Arnott article notes that the majority of disambiguation<br>
approaches employ known statistics of character sequences in the relevant<br>
language to resolve character ambiguity in a given context.<br><br>
Another suggested approach based on word-level disambiguation is disclosed in a<br>
textbook entitled Principles of Computer Speech, authored by I. H. Witten, and<br>
published by Academic Press in 1982 (hereinafter the "Witten approach"). Witten<br>
discusses a system for reducing ambiguity from text entered using a telephone<br>
touch pad. Witten recognizes that for approximately 92% of the words in a 24,500<br>
word dictionary, no ambiguity will arise when comparing the keystroke sequence<br>
with the dictionary. When ambiguities do arise, however, Witten notes that they<br>
must be resolved interactively by the system presenting the ambiguity to the user<br>
and asking the user to make a selection between the number of ambiguous entries.<br>
A user must therefore respond to the system's prediction at the end of each word.<br>
Such a response slows the efficiency of the system and increases the number of<br>
keystrokes required to enter a given segment of text.<br>
H. A. Gutowitz, Touch-Typable Devices Based on Ambiguous Codes and Methods<br>
to Design Such Devices, WO 00/35091 (June 15, 2000) discloses that the design of<br>
typable devices, and, in particular, touch-type devices embodying ambiguous codes<br>
presents numerous ergonomical problems and proposes some solutions for such<br>
problems. Gutowitz teaches methods for the selection of ambiguous codes from the<br>
classes of strongly-touch-typable ambiguous codes and substantially optimal<br>
ambiguous codes for touch-typable devices such as computers, PDA's, and the like,<br>
and other information appliances, given design constraints, such as the size, shape<br>
and computational capacity of the device, the typical uses of the device, and<br>
conventional constraints such as alphabetic ordering or Qwerty ordering.<br><br>
Eatoni Ergonomics Inc. provides a system called WordWise, (Copyright 2001 Eatoni<br>
Ergonomics Inc.), adapted from a regular keyboard, and where a capital letter is<br>
typed on a regular keyboard, and an auxiliary key, such as the shift key, is held<br>
down while the key with the intended letter is pressed. The key idea behind<br>
WordWise is to choose one letter from each of the groups of letters on each of the<br>
keys on the telephone keypad. Such chosen letters are typed by holding down an<br>
auxiliary key while pressing the key with the intended letter. WordWise does not use<br>
a vocabulary database/dictionary to search for words to resolve ambiguous,<br>
unambiguous, or a combination thereof entries.<br>
Zi Corporation advertises a next word prediction, eZiText(R) (2002 Zi Corporation),<br>
but to our knowledge does not anywhere suggest the presentation of multiple<br>
predictions, or the reorder of selection lists to give precedence to words matching<br>
context.<br>
Other next word production systems that are known include iTAP, which is offered<br>
by Motorola's Lexicus division (http://www.motorola.com/lexicus/). and the adaptive<br>
recognition technology offered by AIRTX (http://www.airtx.com/).<br>
Disambiguating an ambiguous keystroke sequence continues to be a challenging<br>
problem. For example, known approaches to disambiguation focus primarily upon<br>
completion of a partially entered sequence, and not upon predicting an as yet<br>
unentered sequence. Further, the user context is not typically taken into account<br>
when disambiguating an entered sequence, nor does the disambiguation of an<br><br>
entered sequence result in the taking of an action on behalf of a user, but rather<br>
merely focuses on the completion and display to a user of an intended sequence.<br>
It would be advantageous to provide an approach to processing user inputs that<br>
results in predicting an as yet unentered sequence. Further, it would be<br>
advantageous to provide an approach in which the user context is taken into<br>
account when disambiguating an entered sequence. Additionally, it would be<br>
advantageous to provide an approach in which the disambiguation of an entered<br>
sequence results in the taking of an action on behalf of a user.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention concerns user entry of information into a system with an input device.<br>
A scheme is provided in which an entire word that a user wants to enter is predicted<br>
after the user enters a specific symbol, such as a space character. If the user<br>
presses an ambiguous key thereafter, rather than accept the prediction, the<br>
selection list is reordered. For example, a user enters the phrase "Lets run to<br>
school. Better yet, lets drive to ".""" After the user presses the space, after first<br>
entering the second occurrence of the word "to," the system predicts that the user is<br>
going to enter the word "school" based on the context in which the user has entered<br>
that word in the past. Other predictions may be available if the user had previously<br>
entered text with the same context (for example, "to work", "to camp"). These<br>
predictions are presented if the user presses the "next" key; the key specified for<br>
scrolling through the list. Should the user enter an ambiguous key after the space,<br>
then a word list is reordered to give precedence to the words that match context. For<br><br>
example, if the user presses the ambiguous key that contains the letters 'a', 'b', and 'c', the<br>
word "camp" is given precedence in the list.<br>
The invention can also make predictions on other forms of context, such as the person to<br>
whom the message is sent, the person writing the message, the day of the week, the time<br>
of the week, etc.<br>
Other embodiments of the invention contemplate anticipation of user actions, as well as<br>
words, such as a user action in connection with menu items, or a user action in connection<br>
with form filling.<br>
User actions or inputs can affect the automatic changing of the device's state based on<br>
context. For example, the system might use context to change a mobile telephone from<br>
'ring' to 'vibrate', during the time that the calendar shows that the user is in a meeting.<br>
Another embodiment uses location context to increase the mobile telephone volume when<br>
the user is outside or when the telephone detects high levels of background noise.<br>
In another embodiment, the system learns the user habits. For example, based on the<br>
learned user action, the system is able to offer services to the user that the user may not<br>
be aware of.<br>
In another embodiment, word prediction is based on the previous word context (bigram<br>
context), but might also use the previous 'n' words (trigram context, etc).<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention concerns user entry of information into a system with an input device. A<br>
scheme is provided in which an entire word that a user wants to enter is predicted after the<br>
user enters a specific symbol, such as a space character. If the user presses an<br>
ambiguous key thereafter, rather than accept the prediction, the selection list is reordered.<br>
For example, a user enters the phrase "Lets run to school. Better yet, lets drive to "."""<br>
After the user presses the space, after first<br><br><br>
entering the second occurrence of the word "to," the system predicts that the user is<br>
going to enter the word "school" based on the context in which the user has entered<br>
that word in the past. Other predictions may be available if the user had previously<br>
entered text with the same context (for example, "to work", "to camp"). These<br>
predictions are presented if the user presses the "next" key; the key specified for<br>
scrolling through the list. Should the user enter an ambiguous key after the space,<br>
then a word list is reordered to give precedence to the words that match context. For<br>
example, if the user presses the ambiguous key that contains the letters 'a', 'b', and<br>
'c', the word "camp" is given precedence in the list.<br>
The invention can also make predictions on other forms of context, such as the<br>
person to whom the message is sent, the person writing the message, the day of the<br>
week, the time of the week, etc.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, rather than explicitly define the context<br>
parameters, such as sender/recipient/email/SMS/reply/forward/new email etc, the<br>
system is passed a series of parameters by the device which may or may not be<br>
relevant and the system learns which of the parameters are relevant for prediction<br>
and which ones are not.<br>
In other embodiments of the invention, prediction may go beyond words and predict<br>
phrases. Prediction also may depend on grammar, semantics etc.<br><br>
Other embodiments of the invention contemplate anticipation of user actions, as well<br>
as words and phrases, such as a user action in connection with menu items, or a<br>
user action in connection with form filling.<br>
In further embodiments, the knowledge gained from user patterns can be<br>
uploaded/downloaded and/or served from a server allowing this information to be<br>
shared between devices and applications.<br>
Discussion<br>
For purposes of the discussion herein, with regard to the contextual completion of<br>
words, the term 'Next Word Prediction' (NWP) means, inter alia:<br>
1)	Predicting, after entering a space character, the entire next word that the user<br>
wants to enter, and<br>
2)	If the user presses an ambiguous key, rather than accept the prediction, the<br>
selection lists are reordered.<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic representation of a device 14 having a display 10 and user<br>
information input mechanism 12, and that incorporates next word prediction<br>
technology according to the invention. In Fig. 1, the user has entered the phrase<br>
"Lets run to school. Better yet, lets drive to." The user presses space after entering<br>
the word "to," and the system predicts that the user is next going to enter the word<br><br>
"school," based on the context in which the user has entered the word "school" in the<br>
past. In this case, only the previous word for the context is looked at. The last time<br>
the user entered the word "to," he entered the word "school" directly after. In the<br>
example of Fig.1, the user has entered the word "to" again, and the prediction word<br>
"school" is present. If in the past the user had entered other words after the word<br>
"to," those additional predictions are provided, as well, in a list, for example. In this<br>
example, context information comes from previous text entered in this message<br>
only. In a preferred embodiment, context information is compiled from text entered<br>
in prior messages/sessions as well.<br>
Predictions are made when the context in the current message matches the context<br>
in text the user previously entered. The concept of context can be very general.<br>
Context can mean the nature of the text entered. Context can also be combined<br>
with other contexts, such as, for example:<br>
a)	The person to whom a message is sent;<br>
b)	The person writing the message;<br>
c)	The day of the week;<br>
d) The time of day.<br>
Finally, the prediction system might not know what the most important factors are for<br>
context, e.g. are they:<br><br>
•	Text and message recipient?;<br>
•	Text and message writer?;<br>
•	All three?.<br>
A further embodiment starts with a very broad set of possible factors and performs<br>
on-the-fly factor analysis of the user behavior to determine the most effective factor<br>
to include as context. This system does more than adapt to user behavior based on<br>
a priori specified factors, such as text, recipient, author, day, that are recorded, but<br>
is also intelligent enough to determine which factors are most important and<br>
emphasize those. This allows for better prediction.<br>
Another example of prediction contemplated by the invention is based upon time of<br>
day. For example, when entering a message "let's meet for" at lunchtime, the word<br>
"lunch" is automatically predicted as the next word in the phrase. Later in the day the<br>
word "dinner" is predicted. The phrases stored also can have time of day associated<br>
with them as one of their attributes. This can be used to decide which phrases are<br>
relevant when the user is entering text.<br>
Prediction of User Actions<br>
Prediction can also be applied to other concepts as well, such as menus and user<br>
actions. When a user clicks a menu, the context module is provided with a keyword<br><br>
for that menu as the preceding context word. The context module then produces<br>
the entries previously selected from that menu because they are in the context<br>
database as entries preceded by that keyword, and those words can be re-ordered<br>
to the top of the menu. When a menu entry is selected, the context module then<br>
automatically notes it as having occurred with the menu tag as context for re-<br>
ordering to the front next time.<br>
For example, when the user clicks the "Edit" menu, the context module is provided<br>
"Edit:" as context. If the last time a user clicked "Edit" the user chose "Find," then<br>
"Find" is shown at the front of the menu. If the user moves past that to "Replace,"<br>
then a use of "Replace" in the context of "Edit:" is marked, so that the next time the<br>
user selects the "Edit" menu, "Replace" becomes the first entry, followed by "Find"<br>
and the other less-frequently used entries.<br>
Note that for cell phones with limited screen space, moving commonly used entries<br>
to the front of a menu can make them immediately visible when they otherwise are<br>
not visible without scrolling.<br>
In one embodiment, learning is used, in simple case context and reorder, to predict<br>
the next macro-level user interface (Ul) behavior the user is expected to perform.<br>
Instead of reordering menus based on past usage, the normal menu format is<br>
superceded entirely by reordering immediate options for the next state/application<br>
the user is expected to go to, and the most likely option can be performed<br>
automatically, if desired.<br><br>
For example, consider the situation where the system knows that whenever a user is<br>
in the settings mode on the phone, and they are choosing an input method or<br>
language, they are very likely to move next to their favorite messaging application.<br>
Then, instead of presenting the user with the normal menu tree to get to the<br>
messaging application, the system:<br>
a)	Goes there automatically, or if that is found to not be feasible;<br>
b)	Presents that as a visible prominent option right there in the settings window,<br>
along with the next most likely option.<br>
The last option would be "go to standard menu tree." This way, the user is<br>
presented with the most likely next end state, rather than the most likely behavior<br>
directly from here, which in a normal phone would be going back to the menu tree.<br>
The user does not have to navigate a menu tree at all, but rather has one click (or<br>
no click) to go to the next task.<br>
Additional embodiments of the invention apply to contexts that, for example pose<br>
any of the following questions:<br>
•	What end state is the user most likely to be in immediately after a messaging<br>
application?<br>
•	What end state is the user most likely to be in after entering something into a<br>
phonebook?<br><br>
•	What end state is the user most likely to be given the last two places he<br>
was?<br>
•	Given the time of day?<br>
•	Should a factor analysis be performed on the fly to isolate the most relevant<br>
factor's involved in deciding what the next move should be?<br>
Forms<br>
Form filling is another useful function performed by the invention. Context sensitivity<br>
by field attribute, e.g. date only predicts months, day switches to numeric mode etc.<br>
This can similarly be applied to form input. The browser, or other form-input<br>
software, can provide the prompt for the input cell as context for text entry of the<br>
cell. Thus, for example, when a form prompts for "Name:" the user's name is<br>
available with few to no keystrokes, and other names he might fill in on forms are<br>
also made easier to enter.<br>
Implementation of contextual word prediction in Tegic T9 Technology<br>
The herein disclosed next word prediction invention has been applied to Tegic<br>
Corporation's T9 technology (see www.tegic.com and www.t9.com). T9 technology<br>
combines the groups of letters found on each key of an input device, e.g. each<br>
phone key, with a fast-access dictionary of words, and recognizes what a user wants<br><br>
to input as text as he types. T9 offers the most commonly-used word for every key<br>
sequence entered by default and then lets the user access other choices with one or<br>
more presses of the NEXT or space key.<br>
A block diagram of a preferred embodiment of a reduced keyboard disambiguating<br>
system hardware for a T9 implementation of the invention is provided in Fig. 2. The<br>
keyboard 54 and the display 53 are coupled to a processor 100 through appropriate<br>
interfacing circuitry. Optionally, a speaker 102 is also coupled to the processor. In<br>
this embodiment, the processor 100 receives inputs from the keyboard, and<br>
manages all output to the display and speaker. The processor 100 is coupled to a<br>
memory 104. The memory includes a combination of temporary storage media,<br>
such as random access memory (RAM), and permanent storage media, such as<br>
read-only memory (ROM), floppy disks, hard disks, or CD-ROMs. The preferred<br>
memory 104 contains all software routines necessary to govern system operation.<br>
Preferably, the memory contains an operating system 106, disambiguating software<br>
108, associated filtering of ambiguous text entry software and/or extending and<br>
interpreting software 110, and a contextual database 116, the latter of which is<br>
discussed in additional detail below. The memory also includes a vocabulary<br>
database 30. Optionally, the memory may contain one or more application<br>
programs 112, 114. Examples of application programs include word processors,<br>
software dictionaries, and foreign language translators. Speech synthesis software<br>
may also be provided as an application program, thereby allowing the reduced<br>
keyboard disambiguating system to function as a communication aid. Therefore, the<br>
output, in this case, might be vocally output from the speaker.<br><br>
It should be appreciated and understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the<br>
discussion herein applies to symbols and sequences of symbols, which, when<br>
combined, make an object or part of an object. A typical example of a symbol is a<br>
character in any language, such as a letter, digit, punctuation mark, or any other<br>
symbol from a language. A typical example of an object or part of an object is a<br>
word or part of a word. However, the discussion herein equally applies to Japanese<br>
kana and Korean jamos. Also, it should be noted that the objects do not have to be<br>
linguistic, as the claimed disambiguating system herein can be used to predict icons,<br>
phone numbers, or inventory records, as long as a type of symbolic string<br>
representation is present. Therefore, it should be appreciated that use of the terms<br>
such as letter, word, word stem, and the like are not limited to only those<br>
applications, and are used to facilitate ease of reading and understanding the<br>
discussion herein.<br>
For purposes of the discussion herein, T9 systems comprise at least three<br>
components:<br>
•	An integration layer. This component contains the user interface (Ul) and handles<br>
communications between the device and the T9 core. Communications can occur<br>
either through an event-based or a function-based API, discussed below.<br>
•	A core engine, for example the core engine known as the T9 core, which is<br>
provided by Tegic.<br><br>
•	One or more language databases (LDBs). Each LDB contains information on a<br>
particular language. T9 uses this information to generate lists of words for that<br>
language. LDBs can include, for example, any of Alphabetic T9 LDBs, Chinese T9<br>
LDBs, and Korean T9 LDBs.<br>
Supplemental Databases<br>
Alphabetic T9 and Chinese T9 implementations can include the following<br>
supplemental databases:<br>
•	User Database (Alphabetic T9). An Alphabetic T9 UDB contains custom words<br>
entered by the user. Typically, these are words that cannot be generated by the<br>
LDB, such as names, e-mail addresses, and instant messaging IDs. The database<br>
also contains information on how frequently a user selects words—both custom<br>
words and words from the LDB.<br>
•	Context Database (Alphabetic T9). An Alphabetic T9 CDB contains information on<br>
the words the user has previously entered. T9 requires this information for its next-<br>
word prediction and CDB word completion features. The context database contains<br>
recently entered words. Alphabetic T9 uses this information to provide predicted and<br>
completed words in the selection list, and to reorder full and completed words in the<br>
selection list.<br>
•	Manufacturer Database (Alphabetic T9). An Alphabetic T9 MDB contains words<br>
one wants to make available to T9 users but which typically cannot be generated by<br><br>
the LDB. MDB entries can include geographic locations, stock ticker symbols, and<br>
URLs.<br>
•	Chinese User Database (Chinese T9). A Chinese T9 CUDB contains user-entered<br>
character phrases, i.e. strings of Chinese characters that together form a phrase.<br>
•	Chinese Automatically Reordering User Database (Chinese T9). A Chinese T9<br>
CAUDB contains recently entered characters from a Chinese T9 LDB.<br>
Generating Selection-List Words<br>
When the user enters an active key sequence, Alphabetic T9 checks its databases<br>
(LDB, UDB, CDB, and MDB) for words that match the key sequence.<br>
The Alphabetic T9 selection list is designed to provide the words a user most likely<br>
desires, based on 1) how frequently the user enters the word, 2) how common the<br>
word is in the language and 3) the previous context in which the keys were entered,<br>
so that the words appear at the beginning of the selection list.<br>
The relative order of selection-list items depends on which databases are enabled<br>
and which features, such as selection list reordering and word completion and word<br>
prediction, are enabled.<br>
The first word in Alphabetic T9's selection list is active by default. The term active<br><br>
word refers to the currently active selection-list word.<br>
An example of the selection list order is given below. It is assumed that keys have<br>
been entered and no T9 database or database features are disabled.<br>
1)	CDB words of length of key sequence.<br>
2)	Reordered (highly used) LDB and Custom user words of length of key<br>
sequence.<br>
3)	Top LDB words of length of key sequence.<br>
4)	Less commonly used Custom words of length of key sequence.<br>
5)	Less commonly used Manufacturer (MDB) words of length of key sequence.<br>
6)	Remaining LDB words of length of key sequence.<br>
7)	CDB words that are longer than entered key sequence (these are completed<br>
by T9).<br>
8)	Custom and manufacturer words that are longer than entered key sequence<br>
(these are completed by T9).<br>
9)	Words that are result of multiple database lookups. These are attempts to<br>
match URLs and other long sequences.<br>
Processing an Accepted Word<br>
When the user accepts the active word by moving the cursor off the word (pressing<br>
keys that correspond to the T9 key values T9KEYRIGHT, or T9KEYLEFT)<br>
Alphabetic T9:<br><br>
•	Adjusts the word's selection frequency value if it is in the UDB as a custom word.<br>
•	Adjusts the word's selection frequency value if it is in the LDB and Alphabetic T9's<br>
selection list reordering feature has not been disabled.<br>
When the user accepts the active word by entering a space (pressing keys that<br>
correspond to the T9 key value T9KEYSPACE) Alphabetic T9 performs the actions<br>
above, as well as the following actions:<br>
•	Adds to the UDB as a custom word all the characters between the newly entered<br>
space and the one before it, if the UDB and LDB do not already contain the word.<br>
•	Adds to the CDB all the characters between the newly entered space and the one<br>
before it.<br>
Predicting the Next Word<br>
Fig. 3 is a flow diagram showing a next word prediction method according to the<br>
invention. As text is entered, the words are stored in the CDB in the order in which<br>
they were entered by the user. When the user enters a word (300), Alphabetic T9<br>
attempts to predict the next word desired (302) if the implementation includes a<br>
CDB. Alphabetic T9 searches the CDB (304) for the first previous occurrence of the<br>
most recently entered word. If Alphabetic T9 finds the word (306), whatever word<br>
appears after it in the database is offered to the user as a predicted word (308). If<br>
the word is not found (306), processing is complete and T9 waits for next key entry<br><br>
(314). If the predicted word is accepted by the user (310) the word is processed; T9<br>
records use of word (316). If the user does not accept the word (310), but presses<br>
the 'next' key (312), the CDB is searched for the next most recent occurrence of the<br>
word just entered (318). If found, the word following it in the database is presented<br>
as a prediction (306 and 308). If the user does not accept the word (310), and does<br>
not press the next key, no processing is complete, and T9 waits for next key entry<br>
(314), as further described in connection with Fig. 4.<br>
Alphabetic T9 creates a selection list of predicted words. The maximum number of<br>
predicted words in the selection list depends on the literal value of the #define<br>
constant T9MAXCDBMATCHES. Unless a different value is assigned, this constant<br>
is set to 6.<br>
The user selects and accepts a predicted word using the same process used in T9<br>
for selecting and accepting a word. After the user accepts a predicted word (310),<br>
Alphabetic T9 processes the word (312). It will be appreciated by those skilled in<br>
the art that the invention may be applied to other disambiguation systems than T9,<br>
as well as other forms of T9 than Alphabetic T9.<br>
Processing Words<br>
Fig. 4 is a flow diagram showing the processing of words in a next word prediction<br>
method according to the invention. When the user presses the Space key (400), to<br>
indicate the start of a new word, Alphabetic T9:<br><br>
•	Adds to the UDB as a custom word (404) all the characters between the newly<br>
entered space and the one before it, if the UDB and LDB do not already contain the<br>
word (402).<br>
•	Adds to the CDB all the characters between the newly entered space and the one<br>
before it (406).<br>
•	Adjusts the word's selection frequency value (410) if it is in the UDB as a custom<br>
word (408).<br>
•	Adjusts the word's selection frequency value (410) if it is in the UDB as a LDB<br>
reordered word (414).<br>
•	Adds the word to UDB as LDB reordered word (416) if it is in the LDB and<br>
Alphabetic T9's selection list reordering or LDB word completion features have not<br>
been disabled (412).<br>
Alphabetic T9 Context Database<br>
The following discussion describes how to implement and operate an Alphabetic T9<br>
Context Database (CDB). A CDB contains information on recently entered words.<br>
Alphabetic T9 uses this information to include predicted and completed words in the<br>
selection list. Whereas Alphabetic T9 checks its other databases only for words that<br>
match the current active key sequence, Alphabetic T9 also checks the CDB for the<br>
most recently accepted word, i.e. the most recently entered non-active word. CDB<br>
words do not necessarily have to match the active word to be included in the<br><br>
selection list. For predicted words, which appear in the preferred embodiment only<br>
when there is no active key sequence, the CDB match depends on the word before<br>
the active word. For completed CDB words, the match depends on both the word<br>
before the active word and the key sequence of the active word.<br>
If Alphabetic T9 finds in the CDB the word the user has entered, Alphabetic T9<br>
suggests the word that immediately follows in the CDB as a predicted word. For<br>
example, if the CDB contains the word pair "text message" and the user enters the<br>
word "text" and then presses the Space key, Alphabetic T9 places "message" in the<br>
selection list as a predicted word.<br>
Also, if Alphabetic T9 finds in the CDB the word the user has entered, Alphabetic T9<br>
suggests the word that immediately follows in the CDB as a completed word if the<br>
word matches the active key sequence, although the completed word contains<br>
additional characters. For example, if the CDB contains the word pair "text message"<br>
and the user enters the word "text," adds a space, and then enters the key<br>
sequence 6-3-7-7, which corresponds to the first four letters in the word "message",<br>
Alphabetic T9 places "message" in the selection list as a completed word.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, CDB word completion operates independently of UDB<br>
custom-word completion, LDB word completion, and MDB word completion.<br>
Implementing a CDB<br>
To implement an Alphabetic T9 CDB, the integration layer should:<br><br>
1.	Allocate persistent memory for the database.<br>
2.	Call T9AWCdbActivate to activate the CDB.<br>
3.	Indicate the CDB's size.<br>
4.	Reset the database, if desired.<br>
5.	Indicate that the integration layer writes data to the database, if necessary.<br><br>
6.	Disable next-word prediction, if desired.<br>
7.	Disable CDB word completion, if desired.<br>
8.	Handle requests submitted by T9.<br>
9.	Copy the database to persistent memory after T9 termination.<br>
The implementation process described above assumes the CDB is stored in non-<br>
volatile memory and that CDB data are copied to RAM before activating CDB<br>
operations. If a different storage model is used, some of the steps above may not<br>
apply.<br>
Allocating Persistent Memory<br><br>
The integration layer must allocate persistent memory to store the CDB. When the<br>
integration layer activates CDB operations by calling T9AWCdbActivate, it copies<br>
the CDB from persistent memory to RAM. The database is referenced as an<br>
instance of the CDB Data Structure (T9AWCdblnfo).<br>
Activating CDB Operations<br>
If there is no existing CDB, e.g. the first time CDB operations are activated on the<br>
device, the integration layer must initialize all T9AWCdblnfo structure fields values to<br>
0. If the integration layer has copied an existing CDB from persistent memory to<br>
RAM, it should not modify any T9AWCdblnfo structure field values.<br>
The integration layer activates CDB operations by calling T9AWCdbActivate. When<br>
the integration layer calls this function, it provides a pointer to an instance of the<br>
CDB Data Structure (T9AWCdblnfo) for which it has allocated memory.<br>
After the integration layer has activated enabled CDB operations, Alphabetic T9<br>
automatically searches the CDB. The type of information Alphabetic T9 searches the<br>
CDB for depends on whether there is an active key sequence:<br>
•	If there is an active key sequence, Alphabetic T9 searches the CDB for words that<br>
match the key sequence.<br>
•	If there is no active key sequence, Alphabetic T9 searches the CDB for the most<br><br>
recently entered word. Alphabetic T9 requires this information for next-word<br>
prediction.<br>
Indicating a CDB's Size<br>
A CDB's size is indicated by the value of T9AWCdblnfo.wDataSize. The wDataSize<br>
field indicates the total size of T9AWCdblnfo. This includes the data area, where<br>
CDB data are stored, several related variables used by T9, and any structure-<br>
padding bytes added by the compiler environment.<br>
If T9's Function API is used, it is not necessary to set the value of<br>
T9AWCdblnfo.wDataSize directly. Instead, the size of the CDB data area is provided<br>
as an argument to the function T9AWCdbActivate. While handling the function, T9<br>
sets the value of T9AWCdblnfo.wDataSize.<br>
One can make the CDB area as large wanted, but it must be at least<br>
T9MINCDBDATABYTES bytes. It is recommended, however, that the CDB be 1800<br>
*	T9SYMBOLWIDTH bytes in size.<br>
Resetting the CDB<br>
When the integration layer activates CDB operations, Alphabetic T9 ensures the<br>
integrity of the database by:<br>
•	Ensuring the CDB is the same size that T9 is expecting.<br><br>
•	Verifying that the CUDB is at least T9CCUDBMINSIZE bytes in size and is an even<br>
number of bytes.<br>
•	Verifying that the CDB uses the same character encoding as the LDBs.<br>
If Alphabetic T9 detects a problem, it resets the CDB, which deletes all CDB data.<br>
This process occurs without any action by the integration layer, and Alphabetic T9<br>
does not notify the integration layer that the CDB has been reset. The integration<br>
layer can explicitly reset the CDB by calling T9AWCdbReset. Under most<br>
circumstances, the integration layer does not need to call this function.<br>
Indicating the Integration Layer Writes Data to the CDB<br>
If the CDB is stored in a memory area that Alphabetic T9 cannot write to, the<br>
integration layer must write data to the database. Also, one may wish to have the<br>
integration layer write data to the CDB if it is desired to monitor what is written to the<br>
database or maintain a shadow copy of the CDB in non-volatile storage.<br>
The integration layer informs Alphabetic T9 that it writes data by calling<br>
T9AWSetCdbWriteByOEM.<br>
After the integration layer calls this event, Alphabetic T9 requests that the integration<br>
layer write data by calling T9REQCDBWRITE. If it is no longer necessary for the<br>
integration layer to write data to the CDB, the integration layer calls<br><br>
T9AWCIrCdbWriteByOEM to indicate that Alphabetic T9 can write data directly.<br>
Disabling Next-Word Prediction<br>
When CDB operations are activated, T9 by default provides predicted words, i.e.<br>
words the user may want to enter, based on the words the user has already entered.<br>
Next-word prediction is available in both Ambiguous and Multitap text-entry modes.<br>
Alphabetic T9 places predicted words in the selection list when the word the user<br>
has just entered is found in the CDB as the first part of one or more word pairs.<br>
Whatever word appears in the CDB after each instance of the word the user has just<br>
entered is provided as a predicted word.<br>
It is possible to disable this functionality if one wants to use only CDB word<br>
completion, and not next-word prediction, in an Alphabetic T9 implementation. To<br>
disable CDB word completion, the integration layer calls T9AWCIrCdbPrediction. To<br>
re-enable next-word prediction, the integration layer calls T9AWSetCdbPrediction.<br>
Disabling CDB Word Completion<br>
When CDB operations are activated, Alphabetic T9 by default places in the selection<br>
list completed CDB words that match the active sequence (and contain additional<br>
characters) if the word immediately before the active word is in the CDB immediately<br>
before the completed word(s). One can disable this functionality if one want to use<br>
only next-word prediction, and not CDB word completion, in an Alphabetic T9<br><br>
implementation. To disable CDB word completion, the integration layer calls<br>
T9AWCIrCdbCompletion. To re-enable CDB word completion, the integration layer<br>
calls T9AWSetCdbCompletion.<br>
Note that CDB word completion operates independently of UDB custom word<br>
completion, LDB word completion, and MDB word completion. Many of the words in<br>
a CDB are also in other Alphabetic T9 databases. Alphabetic T9 suppresses these<br>
duplicates from the selection list. However, the potential effect of this duplication on<br>
other API events functions should be noted. For example, a UDB custom word that<br>
is deleted from the database still appears in the selection list if that word is also in<br>
the CDB. Likewise, if one were to disable LDB word completion, words in the LDB<br>
still appear in the selection list as completed words if they are also in the CDB and<br>
CDB word completion is enabled.<br>
Handling T9 Requests<br>
Depending on how the CDB is implemented, the integration layer may need to<br>
handle the following T9 request:<br>
• T9REQCDBWRITE—Requests that the integration layer write data to the CDB. T9<br>
submits this request only if the integration layer informs T9 that it, and not T9, writes<br>
data to the CDB.<br>
Copy an Updated CDB to Persistent Memory<br><br>
The integration layer should copy the CDB data to persistent memory when it<br>
terminates Alphabetic T9 if the database has been modified during the T9 session.<br>
T9 increments the value of T9AWCdblnfo.wUpdateCounter whenever it modifies the<br>
database. The integration layer can determine whether the database has been<br>
modified by comparing the value of wUpdateCounter after the session to its value<br>
before the session. If the value is different, the integration layer must copy the<br>
updated CDB data to persistent memory. Note that it is likely that T9 modifies the<br>
CDB during every session.<br>
Operating an Alphabetic T9 CDB<br>
Alphabetic T9 CDB operations consist of the following tasks:<br>
•	Adding data to a CDB.<br>
•	Retrieving data from a CDB.<br>
•	Deleting data from a CDB.<br>
Adding Data to a CDB<br>
Alphabetic T9 automatically adds data to the CDB. Note that if the CDB is stored in<br>
a memory area that T9 cannot write to, the integration layer must write data to the<br>
CDB.<br><br>
Retrieving Data from a CDB<br>
Alphabetic T9 automatically retrieves data from the CDB.<br>
Deleting Data from a CDB<br>
Alphabetic T9 does not permit users or the integration layer to delete words from the<br>
database. Instead, Alphabetic T9 automatically begins deleting the oldest words in<br>
the database when it is nearly full. This removal process is referred to as garbage<br>
collection, and it occurs without any action by the user or integration layer.<br>
Operation<br>
In the presently preferred embodiment of the invention, saved context data are used<br>
to return a prediction of the next word upon pressing the space, and to filter the word<br>
completions after entering key strokes. This, in principle, allows a user to reduce the<br>
number of keystrokes by quickly retrieving words that are correctly predicted based<br>
on the previous word or words. This completion feature is presently implemented by<br>
saving user entered text in a Context DataBase (CDB), and returning those words<br>
that match context and keystrokes.<br><br>
NWP saves the recently entered user text and uses that text to predict the next word<br>
that the user enters. For example, if the user has typed the phrases 'hello Leslie,'<br>
hello Inger,' and 'Hello Helena' in the recent past, when the user types and accepts<br>
the word 'hello' by hitting space, the invention suggests:<br>
Leslie<br>
Inger<br>
Helena<br>
as possible next words.<br>
If the user does not accept one of these words, but rather continues typing, the<br>
invention uses context to prioritize completions presented to the user. In an<br>
embodiment employing a 12-key input device, if the above user types the 4 key after<br>
hitting space, the selection list presented to the user is:<br>
i<br>
h<br>
g<br>
4<br>
Inger<br>
Helena<br>
If the above user types the 43 key after hitting space, selection list presented to the<br>
user is:<br><br>
he<br>
if<br>
id<br>
ie<br>
ge<br>
gf<br>
Helena<br>
After a space, the context database (CDB) objects make up the entire selection list.<br>
After pressing ambiguous keys, CDB objects appears as follows:<br>
•	If CDB objects are of the length of the active key sequence, the objects appear<br>
at the top of the selection list.<br>
•	If CDB objects are of a length greater that is than that of the active key<br>
sequence, the objects appear at the top of the completion portion of the list.<br>
System state tracks completions after space with:<br>
pFieldlnfo-&gt;nWordLen	=	0;<br>
pFieldlnfo-&gt;nCompll_en	=	length of context word.<br><br>
After a user selects ambiguous keys, system state tracks CDB completions in the<br>
preexisting way:<br>
pFieldlnfo-&gt;nWordl_en	= length of active key sequence;<br>
pFieldlnfo-&gt;nComplLen	= length of completion.<br>
API<br>
The T9 API consists of a global structure which holds word, wordlist, and buffer<br>
information that is used by the customer, and a set of events or functions for<br>
building, accepting, and deleting words, scrolling through word lists, and more. In<br>
alphabetic T9, the API structure is referred to as the T9AWFieldinfo structure (often<br>
referred to as pAWFieldlnfo). The T9AWFieldlnfo contains data that is specific to<br>
alphabetic T9. The T9AWFieldlnfo structure contains another structure, T9Fieldlnfo<br>
(often referred to as pFieldlnfo), which contains general word data that is also used<br>
in Japanese, Chinese, and Korean T9.<br>
New API structure data and functions were added to T9 to implement NWP. The<br>
NWP feature is active if the host has allocated space for the context database and<br>
set the pFieldlnfo-&gt;pCdblnfo to a non-zero value.<br>
The following function API event is added to activate the CDB:<br><br>
T9AWCdbActivate(T9AWFieldlnfo*pAWFieldlnfo,<br>

The following request type is added:<br>

This is used to request writes to CDB if external write is on.<br>
There is no additional direct access to write to the CDB through the API.<br>

pfieldlnfo	= T9 fieldinfo<br>
psWordBuf	= buffer holding text<br>
nLen	= word length<br>

This function activates the CDB.<br>
Database<br>
Present minimum database size requirements are 1800 * symbol width (300 words *<br>
6 chars/word * symbolwidth bytes/char). This is 1800 for one-byte systems, and<br>
3600 for two-byte systems.<br>
The CDB saves recently entered text in the same form that the user enters it. The<br>
text is stored in a circular buffer. New words overwrite the least recent word in the<br>
CDB.<br>
The CDB has global information in its header:<br>
T9U16 wDataSize; /* Total size in bytes of this struct*/<br>
T9U16 wUpdateCounter; /* Count incremented each time user database<br>
modified */<br>
T9U16 wSymbolClass; /* T9 enum value indicating symbol table mapping for<br>
CDB*/<br>
T9U16 wDataBeginOffset; /* Offset to beginning of data */<br>

Reads<br>
When requesting a word from the CDB, the system word builder passes a context<br>
buffer. Using the context buffer the CDB retrieves context matches in order of<br>
recency.<br>
Writes<br>
When the space key is hit, or white space is entered explicitly, the built word is<br>
written to the CDB. "This happens in both ambiguous and multitap (MT) modes.<br>
The word also goes through its normal RUDB processing. There is no garbage<br>
cleanup in the CDB.<br>
Context Buffer<br>
A context buffer is maintained. The context buffer is updated on the pressing of<br>
space key and is cleared with any action that tends to lose context, such as<br>
cursoring and clearing. In a word API this is attached to the flushword function of a<br>
separate confirm function.<br>
Functional Description<br><br>
In the T9 embodiment, the NWP feature is active if:<br>
a)	the compile includes the code for this feature; and<br>
b)	the field info member pFieldlnfo-&gt;pCdbinfo points to valid memory.<br>
The functional elements that apply when the next word prediction feature is active in<br>
T9 are listed below:<br><br>
FD100: T9 core saves in the CDB every recent word that was used. The number of<br>
words saved depends on the size allocated by the OEM to the CDB.<br>
FD200: T9 ambiguous and MT modes return next word predictions after a space if there<br>
is an active word or the previous key hit is a T9 number key.<br>
FD300: T9 ambiguous and MT modes return next word predictions after right arrow and<br>
space if there is an active word before the right arrow is pressed.<br><br>
FD301: The result of FD300 and FD200 mean:<br>
•	After cursoring off a word, and moving around the buffer, T9 does not present<br>
a prediction after space is hit.<br>
•	"Cursoring around the buffer," means pressing either the left arrow or the right<br>
arrow, and ending with the cursor to the right of a word. The only exception is<br>
when the right arrow is hit to only flush (deactivate) a word.<br>
•	T9 presents a prediction if a prediction is active and the user hits space to<br>
clear the prediction, hits clear again to clear the space, and then hits space<br>
again.<br><br>
FD400: T9 always produces context matches when starting a word if that word is<br>
preceded by a space and another word. As an example, no prediction is delivered after<br>
cursoring around the buffer to the right of a word and hitting key space. However, if the<br>
user continues to type ambiguous number keys, context matches are delivered in the<br>
selection list.<br>
FD500: CDB predictions/completions are retrieved in order of recency.<br>
FD600: CDB is language independent.<br><br>
FD700: After pressing space, the limit of the number of CDB matches is determined by<br>
the compile-time macro T9MAXCDBMATCHES. After the user presses number keys,<br>
there is no limit on the number of CDB matches delivered from the CDB to the builder.<br>
FD800: No CDB predictions/completions are delivered across sentence punctuation.<br>
Sentence punctuation is defined as trailing punctuation on a non-emoticon. See<br>
FD1200 for definition of emoticon.<br>
FD900: CDB predictions/completions are removed after pressing clear with a word<br>
active, but completions are delivered as the user begins typing again.<br>
FD1000: There is no aging of the CDB; the least recent word is replaced by the most<br>
recent word entered.<br><br>
FD1100: Context bigrams are recorded in the CDB on pressing space if there is an<br>
active word, or the previously hit key is a T9 number key. If the user cursors off a word,<br>
context is broken in the CDB.<br>
FD1200: Candidates for context predictions are subject to the following processing:<br>
•	If the word has no leading punctuation, trailing punctuation is stripped unless<br>
this looks like an emoticon. T9 assumes a word with trailing or leading<br>
punctuation is an emoticon if the word is more than one character and the<br>
number of non-alpha characters (punctuation and numbers) is at least one-<br>
half the total number of characters in the word. This is the same rule that is<br>
used for user database (UDB) processing.<br>
•	If the word HAS leading punctuation, the word is rejected unless it appears to<br>
be an emoticon.<br>
FD1300: If the user has pressed a number of T9 keys, context selection list items of the<br>
length of the key sequence are delivered at the beginning of the selection list. Context<br>
selection list items with completions are delivered at the top of the completion portion of<br>
the list, followed by MDB, UBD, and LDB in previously specified order.<br>
FD1400: If caps-lock is on when space is hit, predicted words are entirely in upper<br>
case.<br><br>
FD1500: The leading word is agnostic to case, but the trailing word is case sensitive.<br>
So if one types in "cab fee" and then turns on caps-lock and types in "CAB" and space,<br>
the system predicts "FEE." If one types in "cab fee," then types in "CAB" using shift<br>
rather than caps-lock, and then selects space, the system predicts "fee." Likewise, if<br>
one types in "Cab fee" and then types in "cab" and space, the system predicts "fee."<br>
FD1600: Switches are available to turn on/off context predictions, and to turn on/off<br>
context completions.<br>

Reorder of non-completed words<br>
RUDB processes around reordering of non-completed words remain unchanged.<br>
Clearing<br><br>
Context predictions are not delivered after clearing a current word, but are delivered<br>
as the user begins typing again.<br>
Punctuation<br>
No context predictions are delivered across sentence punctuation.<br>
Aging<br>
There is no aging of the CDB, the least recent word is replaced by the most recent<br>
word entered.<br>
Garbage collection<br>
When space is needed to enter a new word into the CDB, the least recent word in<br>
the CDB is removed to make room.<br>
Entering words in MT<br>
Data for CDB is collected while in MT, and context predictions/completions are<br>
delivered in MT.<br>
My Words<br><br>
CDB processing occurs on the addition of space character, whether or not the<br>
context word was entered in a user maintained MyWords database.<br>
Although the invention is described herein with reference to the preferred<br>
embodiment, one skilled in the art will readily appreciate that other applications may<br>
be substituted for those set forth herein without departing from the spirit and scope<br>
of the present invention. For example, user actions or inputs can effect the<br>
automatic changing of the device's state based on context. For example, the<br>
system might use context to change a mobile telephone from 'ring' to 'vibrate',<br>
during the time that the calendar shows that the user is in a meeting. Another<br>
embodiment uses location context to increase the mobile telephone volume when<br>
the user is outside or when the telephone detects high levels of background noise.<br>
In another embodiment, the system learns the user habits. For example, based on<br>
the learned user action, the system is able to offer services to the user that the user<br>
may not be aware of.<br>
In another embodiment, word prediction is based on the previous word context<br>
(bigram context), but might also use the previous 'n' words (trigram context, etc).<br>
Accordingly, the invention should only be limited by the Claims included below.<br><br>
We claim:<br>
1.	A method for prediction of any of user words or user actions, comprising<br>
operations of:<br>
responsive to a user entering an input sequence into a input device or<br>
performing a specific action associated with said input device, predicting an entire next<br>
word or words that said user wants to enter or an action a user wants to be taken by said<br>
device;<br>
said predicting operation comprising operations of:<br>
said user entering a specific symbol or taking a specific action;<br>
responsive thereto, providing a keyword for a menu based upon context of an<br>
immediately preceding user input sequence or action;<br>
depicting to said user entries previously selected from said menu which are<br>
stored in a context database as entries preceded by said keyword; reordering said entries<br>
in said menu;<br>
when a menu entry is selected, automatically noting it as having been selected<br>
with a menu tag for use as context when re-ordering in the future.<br>
2.	The method as claimed in claim 1, which involves:<br>
responsive to said user entering a specific symbol or taking a specific action,<br>
and based upon context of an immediately preceding user input sequence or action,<br>
superseding normal menu format by reordering immediate options for a next<br>
state/application a user is predicted to go to.<br>
3.	The method as claimed in claim 2, which involves the step of:<br>
automatically performing a most likely option.<br>
4.	A computing apparatus, comprising:<br>

processor programmed to perform operations to receive input characters and symbols<br>
from the input device, manage output to the display, and perform actions within the<br>
apparatus, the operations comprising:<br><br><br>
responsive to the user completing entry of a word, searching the context<br>
database for occurrences of the entered word and upon finding the entered word in the<br>
context database offering to the user one or more words occurring after the entered word<br>
in the context database as a predicted next entry;<br>
responsive to context of the apparatus, predicting a user action other than entry<br>
of text via the input device and automatically changing apparatus state to carry out the<br>
predicted action;<br>
where said context of the apparatus comrpises arrival of a start time for an<br>
entry of an calendar application of the apparatus, and said predicted action comprises<br>
invoking a silent mode of operation of the apparatus.<br>
5.	A computing apparatus, comprising:<br>
a user input device;<br>
a display; a context database comprising a list of words entered by a user in an<br>
order of entry; a processor coupled to the input device and display and context database,<br>
the processor programmed to perform operations to receive input characters and<br>
symbols from the input device, manage output to the display, and perform actions<br>
within the apparatus, the operations comprising:<br>
responsive to the user completing entry of a word, searching the context<br>
database for occurrences of the entered word and upon finding the entered word in the<br>
context database offering to the user one or more words occurring after the entered word<br>
in the context database as a predicted next entry; responsive to context of the<br>
apparatus, predicting a user action other than entry of text via the input device and<br>
automatically changing apparatus state to carry out the predicted action;<br>
where said context of the apparatus comprises user selection of a prescribed<br>
menu entry, and said predicted action includes configuring the menu to streamline an<br>
expected user-invoked follow up action.<br>
6.	A computing apparatus, comprising:<br>

a display; a context database comprising a list of words entered by a user in an<br>
order of entry;<br>
a processor coupled to the input device and display and context database, the<br>
processor programmed to perform operations to receive input characters and symbols<br>
from the input device, manage output to the display, and perform actions within the<br>
apparatus, the operations comprising:<br>
responsive to the user completing entry of a word, searching the context<br>
database for occurrences of the entered word and upon finding the entered word in the<br><br><br>
context database offering to the user one or more words occurring after the entered word<br>
in the context database as a predicted next entry;<br>
responsive to context of the apparatus, predicting a user action other than entry<br>
of text via the input device and automatically changing apparatus state to carry out the<br>
predicted action;<br>
where said context of the apparatus comprises a change in application state of a<br>
first application, and said predicted action comprises one of the following:<br>
automatically opening a second application, streamlining opening of the second<br>
application, prioritizing access to functions offered by the second application.</td>
