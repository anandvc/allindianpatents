				<td>The present invention relates to novel squaraine based dyes. More particularly, the<br>
present invention relates to squaraine based dyes with terminal aminoanthracene or<br>
acridinium units with absorption maximum above 700 nm of the formula 1 (la, Ib, Ic).<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
formula 1 :<br>
A process for the preparation of novel squaraine based dyes has been disclosed and claimed<br>
in our co-pending appj, no.nf .33172001. _,,<br>
Squaraine dyes belong to a class of compound formed by the condensation reaction ofe<br>
different nucleophiles such as aniline or pyrrole with squaraic acid (3,4-dihydroxy-3-<br>
cyclobutene-l,2-dione). Due to their unique properties, squaraine dyes are used in layered<br>
photo-responsive imaging devices to extend the response capability of such devices to visible;:<br>
and infrared illumination. These photo-responsive devices can therefore be utilised, Toiii<br>
example, in conventional electrophotographic copiers as well as laser printers. These<br>
photoresponsive devices may comprise single or multilayered members containing<br>
photoconductive materials comprising squaraine compositions in a photogenic layer.<br>
Photoconductive imaging members containing certain squaraine compositions are known.<br>
Also known are layered photoresponsive devices containing photogenerating layers and<br>
transport layers as described for example, in US Patent Nos. 4123270,4353971, 3838095 and<br>
3824099. Examples of photogenerating layer compositions disclosed in U.S. Pat 4,123,270<br>
include 2, 4 - bis(2 - methyl - 4 - dimethylaminophenyl) -1,3- cyclobutadiene -diylium -<br>
1,3- diolate, 2 - 4 - bis - (2 - hydroxy - 4 - dimethylaminophenyl) - 1 ,3 — cyclobutadine -<br>
diylium - 1, 3, diolate, and 2,4-bis-(p-dimethylaminophenyl)l-3-cyclobutadine-diylium-l,3-<br>
diolate. Other patents disclosing photoconductive devices with squaraines are U.S. Pat No.<br>
6,042980, U.S. Pat. No. 6,040,098, U.S.Pat No. 5,342,719, U.S. Pat. No. 4,471,041, U.S. Pat.<br>
No. 4,486,520, U.S. Pat. No. 4,508,803, U.S. Pat No. 4,507,480, U.S. Pat No. 4,552,822, U.S.*<br>
Pat No. 4,390,610, U.S. Pat No. 4,353,971 and U.S. Pat No. 4, 391,388.<br>
Infrared absorbing dyes with high extinction coefficients are also useful for<br>
generating heat in the medium. In such a process exposure of the medium containing the dye<br>
to infrared actinic radiation of a frequency absorbed by the dye, results in generation of heat<br>
within parts of the medium exposed to the radiation. Materials, which undergo localized<br>
changes of state when, exposed to radiation of high energy density, e.g. laser light can be<br>
used in optical recording media. The thermally induced changes of state are associated with<br>
changes in the optical properties and are utilized for information and data recording. Use of"<br>
squaraine dyes for such applications is described inJJ.S. Pat No. 4, 830, 951. jChe medium<br>
may also comprise a thermally sensitive material capable of undergoing a colour change upon<br>
exposure to heat. Use of squaraine dyes for such applications is described %i U.S. Pat No.<br>
4,623,896, U.S. Pat No. 4,663,518, U.S. Pat No. 4, 720,449, U.S. Pat No. 4,960,901 andU.Sr<br>
-BalNo.5,153,169. Many of the known squaraine dyes are fluorescent compounds emitting light in the<br>
visible and near-infrared region. Consequently another use proposed for squaraine dyes is in<br>
the area of assays. Fluorescent compounds have achieved wide application in assays because<br>
of their ability to emit light upon excitation with light with energy within certain energy<br>
ranges. More specifically there is considerable interest in fluorescent dyes emitting in the<br>
near-infrared region. Such fluorescers have found employment as labels in chemical and*<br>
biochemical processes. Fluorescent labels find applications in immunoassays, involving<br>
specific binding pairs, such as ligands and receptors, for example, antigens and antibodies.<br>
Another use of fluorescent compounds is to incorporate such compounds into a cell wall or<br>
liposome. The cell or the liposome with the fluorescent compound incorporated therein can<br>
also be employed in assays. For example, dyes incorporated into cell membranes are useful in<br>
the area of blood typing where a change in fluorescence because of agglutination of cells is<br>
determined. Liposomes containing fluorescent dyes also find application in immunoassays.<br>
Furthermore such fluorescent compounds should be preferably soluble in aqueous medium or<br>
be at least water compatible.<br>
Laser beams find use in the assay area as means for irradiating a fluorescent<br>
compound. In the filed of assays it is important to avoid background signals produced in<br>
relation to the amount of the analyte, contributed by materials other than the analyte. For<br>
example serum or plasma from a patient is often used to conduct the assay. Serum is itself<br>
fluorescent, however the materials in the serum or plasma that are fluorescent normally<br>
absorb light at wavelengths below 600 nm. Therefore it is desirable that the dyes employed in<br>
fluorescence assays possess absorption maximum greater than 600 nm, since the signal to<br>
noise ratio improves with increasing wavelength of absorption and emission of the dye. A<br>
major bottleneck in the complete utilization of near infrared absorbing dyes for such<br>
applications is that dyes absorbing in this region have low fluorescence quantum yields.<br>
Squaraine dyes synthesized sing aromatic heterocyclic for use in such applications have been<br>
described in U.S. Pat No.5,310,922; U.S. Pat No. 5,329,019, and U.S. Pat No. 5,416,214.<br>
However, the squaraine dyes described in these patents possess absorption and emission<br>
maxima below 700 nm.<br>
Furthermore, several patents disclose processes for preparing squaraine compositions.<br>
For example, U.S. Pat No.4,524,220 illustrates a squaraine forming process by the reaction of<br>
squaric acid, and an aromatic aniline in the presence of an aliphatic amine. In addition, a<br>
process for the preparation of squaraines by the reaction of an alkyl squarate, and an aniline<br>
derivative in the prescience of aliphatic alcohol, and an optional acid catalyst is described in<br>
U.S. Pat No.4,524,219. U.S. Pat No.4,524,218 discloses a process for the preparation of<br>
squaraines by the reaction of squaric acid with an aromatic amine, and a composition selected<br>
from the group consisting of phenols and phenol squaraines, which reaction is accomplished<br>
in the presence of an aliphatic alcohol, squaraines, which reaction is accomplished in the<br>
presence of an aliphatic alcohol, and an optional azeotropic catalyst. Other processes for<br>
preparing squaraines are illustrated in U.S. Pat No. 4,525,592, which describes the reaction of<br>
dialkyl squarate, and an aniline derivative in the presence of an aliphatic alcohol and an acid<br>
catalyst. A method for synthesis of squaraines and intermediates for the synthesis of these<br>
compounds is described in U.S. Pat No.5,919,950. Process for preparation of squarylium dyes<br>
is also described in U.S. Pat No. 5,656,750 and a method for making water soluble squaraine<br>
dyes is described in U.S. Pat No.5,625,062.<br>
Novel unsymmetrical squaraines and methods for their preparation have been<br>
described in U.S. Pat No.4,521,621 and U.S. Pat No. 5,030,537. Although the above<br>
squaraines, and processes thereof are suitable for their intended purposes, there continues to<br>
be a need for other squaraine dyes with strong absorption and emission characteristics beyond<br>
the 700 nm region. More specifically with regard to imagine devices, there remains a need for<br>
stable imaging dyes with certain stable physical and electrical characteristics, with improved<br>
sensitivity in the &gt;700nm region. Enabling the use of such dyes in different imaging and<br>
printing processes, including processes wherein diode lasers are used. New infrared dyes are<br>
needed which absorb at specific wavelength for such applications. Use of naptholactam<br>
squaric acid dyes which belong to a class of Squaraine dyes that contain hetrocyclic enamine<br>
type terminal groups in optical recording materials is described in U.S. Pat No. 4,830,951.<br>
Squaraine dyes possessing tertiary arylamine end groups have the potential for better stability<br>
than those with the heterocyclic enamine type end groups. It has however hitherto not been<br>
possible to produce squaraine dyes containing tertiary arylamine end groups absorbing<br>
beyond 700 nm. Squaraine dyes containing aminothiophcne terminal groups possessing<br>
absorption red shifted to that of squaraine dyes containing terminal dialkylaniline groups has<br>
been reported. The maximum absorption wavelength that could be observed was 705 nm<br>
[Kiel, D.; Hartmann, H.; and Moschny, T., Dyes and Pigments, 17,19,(1991)]. A squaraine<br>
derivative containing 2,3-dihydropyrimidine terminal groups with absorption in the 800 nm<br>
region has been reported [Glieter, R.; Pflasterer, G.; Nuber, B., J. Chem. Soc., Chem.<br>
Commun. 452 (1993); U.S. Pat No. 5,625,062]. However these squaraine derivative contain<br>
secondary amines.<br>
Also, there continues to be a need for new fluorescent dyes with improved absorption<br>
in the near infrared region, possessing long fluorescent lifetimes for application as biological<br>
probes for the analysis of DNA, lipids, peptides and proteins [Soper, S. A. Mattingly, Q.I., J.<br>
Am, Chem Sue. 116,3744, (1994)].<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide novel squaraine based dyes.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a process for the preparation of<br>
squaraine based dyes containing tertiary amino anthracene.<br>
It is a further object of the invention to provide novel squaraine dyes possessing high<br>
extinction coefficients in the near infrared region and hence useful as near infrared absorbed<br>
in thermal imaging processes.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide novel squaraine dyes useful inter alia as<br>
near infrared fluorescent labels for immunoassays<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The aim of the present invention is to provide novel tertiary amino anthracene<br>
containing squaraine compositions and processes for the preparation thereof. The novel<br>
squaraine dyes and novel compositions containing such dyes have an absorption ranging from<br>
650-820 nm with a maximum ranging from 780 to 800 nm and both lipophilic and<br>
hydrophilic dyes are reported in this invention. In addition, novel squaraine dyes with<br>
absorption maxima in the 900 nm region, containing acridine chromophores is also reported.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be prepared by a reaction sequence,<br>
some or all of the individual steps of which are separately known in the art. Most of the<br>
squaraine dyes of the present invention can be made according to procedures similar to those<br>
described in literature [Sprenger, H.-E., Ziegenbein, W. Angew, Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 6,553,<br>
(1967); Sprenger, H.E-; Ziegenbein W. Angew, Chem Int. Ed Engl. 7,530 (1968); Schmidt.<br>
A. H. synthesis 961 (1980)]. In general, squaric acid (3,4-dihydroxy-3-cyclobutene-l,4-<br>
dione) is condensed with the aminoanthracene derivatives under conditions for removing<br>
water from reaction mixture and purifying the dye by crystallization or chromatography. The<br>
group or functionality imparting hydrophilicity or lipophilicity to the compound of the<br>
invention can be introduced into the aminoanthracene derivative before the condensation<br>
reaction.<br>
The squaraine dyes of the patent can be conjugated to specific binding pair (sbp)<br>
members such as antigens and antibodies by techniques that are known in the art. On the<br>
other hand, a linking group as described above can be introduced to the squaraine dye or the<br>
sbp member for attachment to the other component. A functionality for attachment of<br>
carboxylic acid, hydroxyl, thio, amino, aldehydic, amido, activated ethylenes such as<br>
maleimide, sulfonic acid, and the like can be introduced into the squaraine dye or the sbp<br>
member if such functionality is not originally present in the dye. Methods of conjugation<br>
involving sbp members are described in e.g. U.S. Pat No.3,817,837. The dyes produced by<br>
the processes of the present invention may be used in any of the applications in which prior<br>
art near infrared absorbers have been used. The dye can be used in printing inks intended to<br>
provide markings that can be read under near infrared radiation, for example, on packages of<br>
consumer items intended to be scanned by infrared laser scanners. The dyes may also be<br>
useful as charge transfer materials in xerography and electro photography.<br>
The novel squaraine dyes described in the present investigation possess high<br>
extinction coefficients in the near infrared region and will hence be useful as near infrared<br>
absorbed in thermal imaging processes described in the U.S. Pat No. 4,602,263 U.S. Pat<br>
No.4,826,976 and U.S. Pat No.4,830,951.<br>
The dyes may be used in imaging processes wherein absorption or near infrared<br>
radiation by the dye results in acid generation in the medium described in U.S. Pat No. 5,<br>
286,612.<br>
Yet another application of the dyes is its use as near infrared fluorescent labels for<br>
immunoassays.<br>

The present invention has been completed based on the above findings and<br>
accordingly the present invention provides novel squaraine based dyes containing<br>
aminoanthracene terminal groups represented by formula la and formula Ib and<br>
thereof as well as squaraine dyes containing acridine as terminal groups <br>
Formula Ic and derivatives thereof. <br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides novel squaraine based dyes containing terminal aminoanthracene or acridine represrnted by the formula 1 (1a, 1b, 1c)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
and a process for the prepatation thereof which comprises reacting squaric acid with an anthracene or an acridine chromophore in an organic solvent with simultaneous removeal of water formed, cooling the reaction mixture, filtering and drying the residue obtained, recrystallising the residue in an organic solvent to obtain pure product.<br>
An embodiment of present invention is that these novel dyes posses absorption<br>
maxima that are significantly red shifted compared to earlier reported arylamine containing<br>
squaraine dyes such as squaraine dyes containing terminal aniline groups. Another<br>
embodiment of the squaraine dyes of the present investigation that they possess very large<br>
extinction coefficient making them useful in optical recording media which require<br>
generation of heat in the medium following light absorption.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention is that the dyes undergo reversible oxidation<br>
and the oxidation potentials of these dyes make them highly suitable for use in imaging<br>
application such as in photoacid generation and electroreprographic copies as well as in laser<br>
printers.<br>
Yet another embodiment of the invention is that the dyes are highly fluorescent and<br>
can be used as fluorescent labels in immunoassays.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration and therefore should not be<br>
construed to limit the scope of the present investigation.<br>

EXAMPLE - 4<br>
There is considerable interest in the development of new near - infrared absorbing<br>
dyes, especially in the 750-800 nm region for use with diode lasers. Figure 1 shows the<br>
absorption spectrum of formula la in toluene and its absorption spectrum in the solid state is<br>
shown in Figure 3. Figure 2 shows the absorption spectrum of formula Ic in dichloromethane<br>
and its absorption spectrum in the solid state is shown in Figure 4. In solution the compound<br>
formula la shows a. sharp absorption band with absorption maximum around 780 nm and<br>
compound Formula Ic shows a sharp absorption band with maximum around 900 nm. In the<br>
solid state, both the compounds shows panchromatic absorption throughout the visible region<br>
and near-infrared region (upto 1000 nm in the case of Formula la and upto 1700 nm in the<br>
case of formula Ic). The absorption maxima and extinction coefficients of the dyes in<br>
different solutions and also in the solid state are listed in Table 1. The close match of the<br>
absorption maxima of the dyes with the output of semiconductor based solid state lasers make<br>
these dyes ideal candidates for applications in optical recording systems, thermal writing<br>
displays and laser, printing systems.<br>

electrode, El,ox and E2,ox are 0.13 and 0.36V versus SCE.<br>
The reversibility of the oxidation of the dyes as well as the ease of oxidation makes<br>
these dyes highly suitaole for use in imaging processes involving photo-acid-generating<br>
processes. In the acid generating process excitation of the dye by absorption of infrared<br>
radiation is followed by transfer of an electron from the excited state dye molecule to an<br>
electron acceptor which is essentially a super acid precursor, resulting in the generation of the<br>
acid. Accordingly, to increase acid generation, it is desirable that the dye has a sufficiently<br>
low oxidation potential to provide a favourable free energy charge (G°) for electron transfer.<br>
The oxidation potentials of the squaraines. The one electron oxidation potential of arylamine<br>
squaraines reported earlier in the range of 2.9 - 5.5 V versus Ag/AgCl whereas for the<br>
present dye it is of the order of 0.13 V versus Ag/AgCl.<br>
Table 2 lists the El, ox and E2,ox values of formula la and formula Ib in<br>
dichloromethane versus Ag/AgCl.<br>

EXAMPLE-6 <br>
Figure 6 shows the emission spectrum of formula la in toluene. The emission band is<br>
fairly sharp with a maximum at 824 nm. The emission quantum yield of formula la in<br>
toluene is 0.16 and the fluorescence lifetime is 1.78 ns. Table 3 summarises the fluorescence<br>
maxima and quantum yields of formula la and formula Ib respectively.<br>
The difference in the absorption and emission maxima for this class of dyes is much<br>
larger than these for the corresponding squaraine dyes containing terminal aniline groups.<br>
The desirable properties of near-infrared absorbing dyes for applications in<br>
fluorescent assays are (i) high quantum yield of fluorescence, (ii) large differences between<br>
the absorption and emission maxima and (iii) sensitivity of the aforementioned fluorescence<br>
properties on the nature of the medium. The data summarized in Table 3, show that the novel<br>
squaraine dyes described in the present invention fulfill all these characteristics. Although the<br>
fluorescence quantum yields of these dyes are lower than that of the anilino squaraines, the<br>
very large bathochromic shift in the absorption and emission maxima of the aminoanthracene<br>
squaraines makes these dyes more suitable for applications as fluorescent labels in<br>
fluorescence assays. Moreover the dyes have much higher fluorescence quantum yields,<br>
compared to near-infrared fluorochromes with high fluorescence efficiencies reportedjn the<br>
literature, such as IR-125 and IR-132 [Soper, S.A and Mattingly, Q.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc.,<br>
116.3744, (1994)].<br>

ADVANTAGES<br>
The squaraine based dyes of the present invention posses satisfactory properties<br>
required of near infrared absorbing dyes.<br>
1. Squaraine dyes containing aminoanthracene terminal groups represented by<br>
structures Formula la and Ib and acridine as terminal group represented by<br>
structure formula Ic are pure single substances.<br>
2. Their synthetic methodology is simple and economical.<br>
3. They are stable to atmospheric influences and daylight.<br>
4. They possess strong absorption in the near infrared region with absorption<br>
maxima centred around 780 - 800 nm.<br>
5. Because of their strong absorption in the near infrared region the dyes are<br>
sensitive to light from solid state diode lasers emitting at near infrared wavelength<br>
above 700 nm.<br>
6. The dyes can be used in optical recording systems requiring generation of heat, in<br>
the medium following light absorption as described in US Pat. No. 4,830,951.<br>
7. The dyes undergo reversible one and two electron oxidation reaction at potential<br>
much lower than that reported for squaraine dyes containing terminal aniline<br>
groups. The dyes can hence behave as excited state electron donors making them<br>
useful as sensitizers for photoacid generation as described in US, Pat No.<br>
5,286,612.<br>
8. The dyes posses high quantum yields of fluorescence in nonpolar environments<br>
and can hence be useful as fluorescent labels in immunoassays.<br>
