COAXIAL COMMUNICATION CABLE HAVING BIMETALLIC OUTER CONDUCTOR<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a coaxial cable, and more<br>
particularly to an improved low-loss coaxial cable having enhanced attenuation<br>
and mechanical bending properties.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Coaxial cables are commonly used today in the transmission of<br>
broadband signals, such as cable television signals and cellular telephone broadcast<br>
signals, for example. One typical type of coaxial cable includes a core containing<br>
an inner conductor, an aluminum sheath surrounding the core and serving as an<br>
outer conductor, and a foam polymer dielectric which surrounds the inner<br>
conductor and electrically insulates it from the surrounding metallic sheath. A<br>
protective jacket is often provided surrounding the metallic sheath.<br>
Coaxial cable manufacturers continue to strive to improve the<br>
electrical performance of the cable, and in particular, to lower the signal<br>
attenuation at high frequency. At the same time, any alterations in the cable design<br>
must maintain adequate mechanical characteristics, such as cable bending<br>
performance and resistance to unwanted deformation during installation, which can<br>
impair the electrical performance. U.S. Patent 4,104,481 addressed these concerns<br>
by improving the composition of the foam dielectric. U.S. Patent 4,472,595<br>
provided improvements in cable performance by reducing the stiffness of the<br>
tubular sheath in relation to the stiffness of the cable core.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides an improved cable with excellent<br>
mechanical performance and with lowered attenuation at high frequency. In<br>
accordance with the present invention, the cable uses an outer tubular sheath<br>
formed of a bimetallic material of two different metals.<br>
The cable comprises at least one inner conductor, a foam dielectric<br>
surrounding this inner conductor, and an electrically and mechanically continuous<br>
tubular sheath formed of a bimetallic material closely surrounding the foam<br>
dielectric and being adhesively bonded thereto. The bimetallic tubular sheath<br>
includes an inwardly facing layer of a first metal bonded to the dielectric and an<br>
outwardly facing layer of a second metal different from the first metal. The<br>
inwardly facing first metal layer preferably has a lower resistivity than the<br>
outwardly facing second metal layer.<br>
The wall thickness of the tubular metallic sheath is suitably less<br>
than about 750 micrometers and the first metal layer may have a thickness less<br>
than about 100 micrometers. In a further more specific aspect, the first metal is<br>
copper and the second metal is aluminum.<br>
The coaxial cable may further include a protective outer jacket<br>
surrounding the sheath. Preferably, the tubular metallic sheath has a thickness of<br>
no greater than about 2.5 percent of its outer diameter.<br>
In one specific embodiment, the coaxial communications cable<br>
comprises a center conductor extending coaxially of the longitudinal axis of the<br>
cable and formed of a copper-clad aluminum bimetallic conductor, a low loss foam<br>
dielectric surrounding the inner conductor, and an electrically and mechanically<br>
continuous smooth-walled tubular sheath formed of a bimetallic material closely<br>
surrounding said foam dielectric. The bimetallic tubular sheath includes an<br>
inwardly facing copper layer and an outwardly facing aluminum layer<br>
metallurgically bonded to the copper layer. The sheath has a wall thickness of less<br>
than 750 micrometers and the wall thickness is no greater than about 2.5 percent of<br>
its outer diameter. A thin continuous layer of adhesive is disposed between the<br>
foam dielectric and the sheath and serves to bond the foam dielectric to the<br>
inwardly facing copper layer to form a structural composite. A polymeric jacket<br>
surrounds the tubular sheath and is bonded to the outwardly facing aluminum<br>
layer.<br>
The present invention provides a coaxial communication cable comprising<br>
at least one inner conductor, a foam dielectric surrounding said at least one inner<br>
conductor, and an electrically and mechanically continuous tubular sheath<br>
formed of a bimetallic material closely surrounding said foam dielectric and being<br>
adhesively bonded thereto, said bimetallic tubular sheath having an inwardly<br>
facing copper layer bonded to said dielectric and an outwardly facing aluminum<br>
layer, and wherein said aluminum layer is of such a thickness as to constitute<br>
more than half the overall cross sectional thickness of the bimetallic material.<br>
These and other features of the present invention will become more<br>
readily apparent to those skilled in the art upon consideration of the following<br>
detailed description which describes both the preferred and alternative<br>
embodiments of the invention.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The drawing figure is a perspective view showing a coaxial cable in<br>
accordance with the present invention in cross-section and with portions of the<br>
cable broken away for purposes of clarity of illustration.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The drawing illustrates a coaxial cable produced in accordance with<br>
the present invention. The coaxial cable comprises a core 10 which includes an<br>
inner conductor 11 of a suitable electrically conductive material, and a surrounding<br>
continuous cylindrical wall of expanded foam plastic dielectric material 12.<br>
Preferably, the foam dielectric 12 is adhesively bonded to the inner conductor 11<br>
by a thin layer of adhesive 13 such that the bond between the inner conductor 11<br>
and dielectric 12 is stronger than the dielectric material. The inner conductor 11<br>
may be formed of solid copper, copper tubing or of copper-clad aluminum. The<br>
inner conductor 11 preferably has a smooth surface and is not corrugated. In the<br>
embodiment illustrated, only a single inner conductor 11 is shown, but it is to be<br>
understood that the present invention is applicable also to cables having more than<br>
one inner conductor insulated from one another and forming a part of the core 10.<br>
Furthermore, in the illustrated embodiment, the inner conductor 11 is a wire<br>
formed of an aluminum core 1 la with a copper outer cladding layer 11b.<br>
The dielectric 12 is a low loss dielectric formed of a suitable plastic<br>
such as polyethylene. Preferably, in order to reduce the mass of the dielectric per<br>
unit length and hence reduce the dielectric constant, the dielectric material should<br>
be of an expanded cellular loam composition, and in particular, a closed cell foam<br>
composition is preferred because of its resistance to moisture transmission.<br>
Preferably, the cells of the dielectric 12 are uniform in size and less than 200<br>
microns in diameter. One suitable foam dielectric is an expanded high density<br>
polyethylene polymer such as described in commonly owned U.S. Pat. No.<br>
4,104,481, issued Aug. 1,1978. Additionally, expanded blends of high and low<br>
density polyethylene are preferred for use as the foam dielectric. The foam<br>
dielectric has a density of Less than about 0.28 g/cc, preferably, less than about 0.25<br>
g/cc.<br>
Although the dielectric 12 of the invention generally consists of a<br>
uniform layer of foam material, the dielectric 12 may have a gradient or graduated<br>
density such that the density of the dielectric increases radially from the inner<br>
conductor 11 to the outside surface of the dielectric, either in a continuous or a<br>
step-wise fashion. For example, a foam-solid laminate dielectric can be used<br>
wherein the dielectric 12 comprises! a low density foam dielectric layer surrounded<br>
by a solid dielectric layer. These constructions can be used to enhance the<br>
compressive strength and. bending properties of the cable and permit reduced<br>
densities as low as 0.10 g/cc along the inner conductor 11. The lower density of<br>
the foam dielectric 12 along the inner conductor 11 enhances the velocity of RF<br>
signal propagation and reduces signal attenuation.<br>
Closely surrounding the core is a continuous tubular smooth-walled<br>
sheath 14. The sheath 14 is characterized by being both mechanically and<br>
electrically continuous. This allows the sheath 14 to effectively serve to<br>
mechanically and electrically seal the cable against outside influences as well as to<br>
seal the cable against leakage of RF radiation. The tubular sheath 14 has a wall<br>
thickness selected so as to maintain a T/D ratio (ratio of wall thickness to outer<br>
diameter) of less than 2.5 percent. Preferably, the thickness of the bimetallic<br>
sheath 14 is less than 2.5% of its outer diameter to provide the desired bending and<br>
electrical properties of the invention. In addition, the tubular bimetallic sheath 14<br>
is smooth-walled and not corrugated. The smooth-walled construction optimizes<br>
the geometry of the cable to reduce contact resistance and variability of the cable<br>
when connectorized and to eliminate signal leakage at the connector.<br>
In the preferred embodiment illustrated, the tubular bimetallic<br>
sheath 14 is made from a bimetallic strip formed into a tubular configuration with<br>
the opposing side edges of the strip butted together, and with the butted edges<br>
continuously joined by a continuous longitudinal weld, indicated at 15. The<br>
welding may be carried out generally as described in U.S. Patents 4,472,595 and<br>
5,926,949, which are incorporated herein by reference. While production of the<br>
sheath 14 by longitudinal welding has been illustrated as preferred, persons skilled<br>
in the art will recognize that other methods for producing a mechanically and<br>
electrically continuous thin walled tubular bimetallic sheath could also be<br>
employed.<br>
The bimetalic strip from which the sheath is formed is composed of<br>
two metal layers metallurgically bonded to one another to form a integral unitary<br>
metal strip. The two metal layers are formed of different metals having different<br>
electrical resistivities. In producing the tubular sheath, the metal layers are<br>
preferably oriented so that the lower resistivity metal layer 14a is inwardly facing<br>
and the higher resistivity metal layer 14b faces outwardly of the tubular sheath in<br>
order to improve the attenuation properties of the cable. While various different<br>
metals could be selected, in a preferred embodiment, the invention uses a<br>
bimetallic strip of copper and aluminum. The thickness of the strip is less than<br>
about 750 micrometers (desirably less than about 500 micrometers) and the copper<br>
layer has a thickness less than about 100 micrometers. Most desirably, the<br>
thickness of the copper is such that in the sheath, after fabrication and sinking onto<br>
the cable core, the copper layer has a thickness between 25 and 75 micrometers. In<br>
certain other specific applications, it may be desirable for the copper layer to be<br>
oriented outwardly, e.g. for compatibility with connectors (providing a copper-to-<br>
copper connection) or for improved mechanical performance.<br>
The inner surface of the tubular sheath 14 is continuously bonded<br>
throughout its length and throughout its circumferential extent to the outer surface<br>
of the foam dielectric 12 by a thin layer of adhesive 16. A preferred class of<br>
adhesive for this purpose is a random copolymer of ethylene and acrylic acid<br>
(EAA). The adhesive layer 16 should be made as thin as possible so as to avoid<br>
adversely affecting the electrical characteristics of the cable. Desirably, the<br>
adhesive layer 16 should have a thickness of about 25 micrometers or less.<br>
The outer surface of the sheath 14 is surrounded by a protective<br>
jacket 18. Suitable compositions for the outer protective jacket 18 include<br>
thermoplastic coating materials such as polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride,<br>
polyurethane and rubbers. Although the jacket 18 illustrated in Figure 1 consists<br>
of only one layer of material, laminated multiple jacket layers may also be<br>
employed to improve toughness, strippability, burn resistance, the reduction of<br>
smoke generation, ultraviolet and weatherability resistance, protection against<br>
rodent gnaw-through, strength resistance, chemical resistance and/or cut-through<br>
resistance. In the embodiment illustrated, the protective jacket 18 is bonded to the<br>
outer surface of the sheath 14 by an adhesive layer 19 to thereby increase the<br>
bending properties of the coaxial cable. Preferably, the adhesive layer 19 is a thin<br>
layer of adhesive, such as the EAA copolymer described above. Although an<br>
adhesive layer 19 is illustrated in the drawing, the protective jacket 18 can also be<br>
directly bonded to the outer surface of the sheath 14.<br>
The coaxial cables of the present invention are beneficially designed<br>
to limit buckling of the bimetallic sheath during bending of the cable. During<br>
bending of the cable, one side of the cable is stretched and subject to tensile stress<br>
and the opposite side of the cable is compressed and subject to compressive stress.<br>
If the core is sufficiently stiffin radial compression and the local compressive yield<br>
load of the sheath is sufficiently low, the tensioned side of the sheath will elongate<br>
by yielding in the longitudinal direction to accommodate the bending of the cable.<br>
Accordingly, the compression side of the sheath preferably shortens to allow<br>
bending of the cable. If the compression side of the sheath does not shorten, the<br>
compressive stress caused by bending the cable can result in buckling of the<br>
sheath.<br>
The ability of the sheath to bend without buckling depends on the<br>
ability of the sheath to elongate or shorten by plastic material flow. Typically, this<br>
is not a problem on the tensioned side of the cable. On the compression side of the<br>
tube, however, the sheath will compress only if the local compressive yield load of<br>
the sheath is less than the local critical buckling load. Otherwise, the cable will be<br>
more likely to buckle thereby negatively affecting the mechanical and electrical<br>
properties of the cable.<br>
The coaxial cables of the present invention have enhanced bending<br>
characteristics over conventional coaxial cables. One feature which enhances the<br>
bending characteristics of the cable is the use of a very thin bimetallic sheath 14.<br>
In an aluminum/copper bimetallic sheath, the relatively lower compressive yield<br>
strength of the aluminum component contributes to the avoidance of buckling<br>
failures during bending. The copper component, which has a higher compressive<br>
yield strength, is of such thinness mat it does not adversely impact the overall<br>
compressive yield strength of the bimetallic sheath and the presence of the copper<br>
component of the bimetallic sheath contributes significantly to enhanced electrical<br>
performance, i.e. attenuation values. Preferably, the aluminum layer is of such a<br>
thickness as to constitute more than half, and preferably more than three-fourths of<br>
the overall cross sectional thickness of the bimetallic strip from which the sheath is<br>
formed.<br>
Another feature which enhances the bending characteristics of the<br>
coaxial cable of the invention is that the sheath 14 is adhesively bonded to the<br>
foam dielectric 12 and the protective jacket 18. In this relationship, the foam<br>
dielectric 12 and the jacket 18 support the sheath 14 in bending to prevent damage<br>
to the coaxial cable. The bending characteristics of the coaxial cable are further<br>
improved by providing an adhesive layer 19 between the tubular bimetallic sheath<br>
14 and the outer protective jacket 18.<br>
Furthermore, increased core stiffness in relation to sheath stiffness<br>
is beneficial to the bending characteristics of the coaxial cable. Specifically, the<br>
coaxial cables of the invention have a core to sheath stiffness ratio of at least 5, and<br>
preferably of at least 10. In addition, the minimum bend radius in the coaxial<br>
cables of the invention is significantly less than 10 cable diameters, more on the<br>
order of about 7 cable diameters or lower. The reduction of the tubular sheath wall<br>
thickness is such that the ratio of the wall thickness to its outer diameter (T/D ratio)<br>
is no greater than about 2.5 percent and preferably no greater than about 1.6<br>
percent. The reduced wall thickness of the sheath contributes to the bending<br>
properties of the coaxial cable and advantageously reduces the attenuation of RF<br>
signals in the coaxial cable. The combination of these features and the properties<br>
of the sheath 14 described above results in a cable with a unique combination of<br>
electrical performance (e.g. low attenuation values) and mechanical bending<br>
performance.<br>
It is understood that upon reading the above description of the<br>
present invention, one skilled in the art could make changes and variations<br>
therefrom. These changes and variations are included in the spirit and scope of the<br>
