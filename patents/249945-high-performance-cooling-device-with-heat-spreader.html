				<td>HIGH PERFORMANCE COOLING DEVICE WITH HEAT SPREADER<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to a cooling device including a heat<br>
spreader for removing heat from a component connected with the cooling device.<br>
More specifically, the present invention relates to a cooling device that includes a heat<br>
spreader made from a dissimilar material with a higher thermal conductivity than a<br>
material of a heat mass of the cooling device so that heat in a component connected<br>
with the cooling device is efficiently removed.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is well known in the electronics art to place a heat sink in contact with an<br>
electronic device so that waste heat generated by operation of the electronic device is<br>
thermally transferred to the heat sink thereby cooling the electronic device. With the<br>
advent of high clock speed electronic devices such as microprocessors (uP), digital<br>
signal processors (DSP), and application specific integrated circuits (ASIC), the<br>
amount of waste heat generated by those electronic devices and the operating<br>
temperature of those electronic devices are directly proportional to clock speed.<br>
Therefore, higher clock speeds result in increased waste heat generation which in turn<br>
increases the operating temperature of the electronic device. However, efficient<br>
operation of the electronic device requires that waste heat be continuously and<br>
effectively removed.<br>
Heat sink devices have become commonplace as a means for dissipating<br>
waste heat from electronic devices such as the types described above. In a typical<br>
application, a component to be cooled is carried by a connector that is mounted on a<br>
PC board. A heat sink is mounted on the component by attaching the heat sink to the<br>
connector using a clip or fasteners, for example. Alternatively, the heat sink is mounted<br><br>
to a PC board that carries the electronic device and fasteners or the like are used to<br>
connect the heat sink to the PC board via holes that are drilled in the PC board.<br>
The need to drill holes can be one disadvantage to using fasteners because the<br>
fasteners or other mounting hardware used for connecting the heat sink to the PC<br>
board are usually electrically conductive and there is a risk of an electrical short due to<br>
contact between a PC board trace and the mounting hardware. Moreover, to avoid<br>
electrical shorts, the PC board traces can be routed around the hole, but that routing<br>
requires keep out zones that can complicate the routing of the traces.<br>
Typically, a heat sink used in conjunction with a modem high clock speed<br>
electronic device will use an electrical fan mounted on top of the heat sink or within a<br>
cavity formed by cooling fins/vanes of the heat sink. The cooling fins increase the<br>
surface area of the heat sink and maximize heat transfer from the heat sink to ambient<br>
air that surrounds the heat sink. The fan causes air to circulate over and around the<br>
cooling fins thereby transferring heat from the cooling fins into the ambient air.<br>
As mentioned previously, with continuing increases in clock speed, the amount<br>
of waste heat generated by electronic devices has also increased. Accordingly, to<br>
adequately cool those electronic devices, larger heat sinks and/or larger capacity fans<br>
(i.e. in CFM) are required. Increasing the size of the heat sink results in a greater<br>
thermal mass and a greater surface area from which the heat can be dissipated.<br>
Increases in fan capacity provide for more air flow through the cooling fins.<br>
There are disadvantages to increased fan and heat sink size. First, if the size of<br>
the heat sink is increased in a vertical direction (i.e. in a direction transverse to the PC<br>
board), then the heat sink is tall and may not fit within a vertical space in many<br>
applications, such as the chassis of a desktop computer. Second, if the PC board has<br>
a vertical orientation, then a heavy and tall heat sink can mechanically stress the PC<br>
board and/or the electronic device resulting in a device or PC board failure.<br><br>
Third, a tall heat sink will require additional vertical clearance between the heat<br>
sink and a chassis the heat sink is contained in to allow for adequate air flow into or out<br>
of the fan. Fourth, if the heat sinks size is increased in a horizontal direction, then the<br>
amount of area available on the PC board for mounting other electronic devices is<br>
limited. Fifth, when the heat sink has a cylindrical shape formed by the fins it is often<br>
not possible to mount several such heat sinks in close proximity to each other because<br>
air flow into and out of the fins is blocked by adjacent heat sinks with a resulting<br>
decrease in cooling efficiency.<br>
Finally, increases in fan size to increase cooling capacity often result in<br>
increased noise generation by the fan. In many applications such as the desktop<br>
computer or a portable computer, it is highly desirable to minimize noise generation. In<br>
portable applications that depend on a battery to supply power, the increased power<br>
drain of a larger capacity fan is not an acceptable solution for removing waste heat.<br>
In the above mentioned heat sink with cooling fins there are additional<br>
disadvantages to mounting the fan within a cavity formed by the fins. First, a substantial<br>
portion of a heat mass of the heat sink is partially blocked by the fan because the fan is<br>
mounted directly on the heat mass and therefore blocks a potential path for heat<br>
dissipation from the heat mass because air from the fan does not circulate over the<br>
blocked portion of the heat mass.<br>
Second, without the fan, a depth of the fins could extend all the way to a center of<br>
the heat mass; however, the depth and surface area of the fins is reduced by a<br>
diameter of the fan because the fan is mounted in a cavity having a diameter that is<br>
slightly larger than the fans diameter to provide clearance for the fan blades.<br>
Consequently, the heat mass of the heat sink must be made broader to compensate for<br>
the reduced surface area of the fins. The broader heat mass increases the size, cost,<br>
and weight of the heat sink.<br>
Third, the reduced depth of the fins makes it easier for the fins to be bent if<br>
damaged. One possible consequence of a bent fin is that it will contact and damage<br><br>
the fan blades and/or cause the fan to stall thereby damaging the fan or causing the fan<br>
to fail. Fourth, because the fan is mounted in the cavity formed by the fins, power leads<br>
for the fan must be routed through a space between the fins. Sharp edges on the fins<br>
can cut the power leads or cause an electrical short. In either case, the result is that the<br>
fan will fail. Fifth, glue is typically used to mount the fan to the heat sink and the glue can<br>
get into the fan and cause the fan to fail. Any of the above mentioned fan failure modes<br>
can lead to a failure of the electronic device the heat sink was designed to cool<br>
because air circulation generated by the fan is essential to effectively dissipate waste<br>
heat from the electronic device.<br>
Some prior heat sinks attempt to overcome the aforementioned disadvantages<br>
of a larger heat mass or increased fin area by using a metal heat spreader that is<br>
joined with the heat sink. Typical processes for joining the heat spreader with the heat<br>
sink include brazing, soldering, heat shrink fitting, vacuum brazing, micro forging and<br>
shrink fitting.<br>
One disadvantage of those processes is that they are very expensive resulting in<br>
a higher cost for the heat sink. Another disadvantage is that the above processes are<br>
limited in their ability to join dissimilar metals for the heat sink and the heat spreader,<br>
particularly if the metal for the heat spreader has superior thermal conductivity<br>
properties over the metal for the heat sink. A disadvantage of the shrink fitting process<br>
is that a thermal resistance between the heat spreader and the heat sink is high due to<br>
micro gaps between the heat spreader and the heat sink. Finally, depending on the<br>
application, another potential disadvantage to the above processes is that once joined,<br>
the heat sink and the heat spreader cannot be easily removed for servicing or for a field<br>
upgrade to a better material for the heat spreader.<br>
Consequently, there is a need for a cooling device with a heat spreader that<br>
allows for the use of dissimilar materials that are optimized for efficient thermal<br>
conduction and heat dissipation. There is also a need for a cooling device with a heat<br>
spreader that eliminates micro gaps between the heat spreader and a heat mass so<br>
that there is a low thermal resistance between the heat spreader and the cooling<br><br>
device. There is a need for a cooling device with a heat spreader that provides an<br>
inexpensive processes for joining the heat spreader with the cooling device. There<br>
exists a need for a cooling device with dissimilar materials for the heat mass and the<br>
heat spreader that allows the heat spreader to be fixedly connected with the heat mass<br>
to prevent the heat mass and the heat spreader from separating from each other.<br>
Finally, there exists a need for a cooling device with a heat spreader that allows for<br>
easy disassembly and in field servicing.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Broadly, the present invention is embodied in a cooling device for dissipating<br>
waste heat from a component to be cooled. The cooling device includes a heat mass<br>
made from a first material and including a base, an arcuate boss that is surrounded by<br>
an arcuate groove, a taper bore extending from the base to the boss, and an aperture<br>
extending from the boss to the taper bore. A fastener including a head and a threaded<br>
shaft is inserted through the aperture with the head in contact with the boss. A heat<br>
spreader made from a second material that is dissimilar to the first material includes a<br>
taper wall that complements the taper bore of the heat mass, a mounting surface<br>
adapted to thermally connect with the component, a threaded aperture adapted to<br>
receive the threaded shaft of the fastener. Optionally, a thermal sealant is connected<br>
with the taper wall and/or the taper bore.<br>
The heat spreader is inserted into the taper bore and the threaded shaft is<br>
threaded into the threaded aperture and the head of the fastener is turned to urge the<br>
taper wall into contact with the taper bore. The optional thermal sealant is operative to<br>
seal micro gaps between the taper bore and the taper wall so that a thermal resistance<br>
between the heat mass and the heat spreader is reduced.<br>
Extending from the heat mass are a plurality of vanes that are spaced apart from<br>
each other to define a primary slot between adjacent vanes and extending to the heat<br>
mass. The vanes have a surface area that increases in a radially outward direction<br><br>
from an axis of the heat mass and a portion of the surface area of the vanes also<br>
increase in a direction that is along the axis. The vanes include a top face upon which a<br>
fan can be mounted, an aerodynamically profiled inner wall that defines a chamber that<br>
surrounds the boss and the groove, and an outer wall including a surface profile that<br>
widens from the base to the top face and includes a smooth curved portion, a draft<br>
portion, and a smooth radially outward portion. Furthermore, the surface area of the<br>
vanes is increased by a plurality of fins formed in each vane by a secondary slot<br>
extending through a portion of the vane.<br>
An air flow entering the chamber creates a three-dimensional air flow that<br>
dissipates heat from the cooling device. First, the air flow exits through the vanes and<br>
a portion of the fins in an exhaust flow that dissipates heat from the vanes and the fins.<br>
Second, the exhaust flow creates a low pressure region within the chamber that induces<br>
an intake flow into the chamber through a major portion of the fins and a top portion of<br>
the vanes thereby dissipating heat from the fins and the vanes. Third, the low pressure<br>
region induces a surface flow along the inner wall so that the surface flow wets the<br>
groove and the boss as it passes over the groove and the boss to dissipate heat from<br>
the heat mass.<br>
The cooling device of the present invention solves the aforementioned<br>
disadvantages of prior heat sinks. The cooling device can be mounted to a component<br>
to be cooled by using a clip to connect the cooling device with a connector that carries<br>
the component. Therefore, holes need not be drilled in a PC board to mount the<br>
cooling device. The cooling device employs vanes that extend deep within the heat<br>
mass and the surface area of the vanes increases from a bottom of the cooling device<br>
to a top of the cooling device and in a radially outward direction from the heat mass.<br>
Furthermore, each vane is split into at least two fins thus further increasing the surface<br>
area available for cooling. As a result, the codling device need not be made taller to<br>
increase vane surface area and the cooling device need not be made wider to<br>
increase the size of the heat mass.<br><br>
The top of the cooling device is adapted to mount a fan so that the heat mass is<br>
not blocked by the fan and air can circulate over the heat mass thus further dissipating<br>
heat from the cooling device. The fan can include a shroud that surrounds the blades<br>
unlike the fans that are mounted in a cavity formed by fins of prior heat sink devices.<br>
However, the cooling device can also mount a fan without a shroud using a clip or<br>
space frame to mount the fan to the top of the cooling device. Because the fan is<br>
mounted on top of the cooling device, the wires of the power leads for the fan are not<br>
routed through the vanes or fins thereby eliminating the risk of the wires being cut or<br>
short circuited.<br>
The shape of the cooling device (wider at the top than at the bottom) allows for<br>
several of the cooling devices to be placed adjacent to each other without blocking air<br>
flow into and out of the vanes and fins.<br>
The vanes of the cooling device can be tangentially oriented with a circle<br>
centered on an axis of the heat mass and the vanes can be inclined at an angle with<br>
respect to the axis such that the angle of inclination substantially matches or closely<br>
approximates a pitch angle of the blades of a fan. The tangential orientation and the<br>
inclination of the vanes reduces fan noise due to air shock losses.<br>
The heat spreader can be mounted with the heat mass using a fastener or the<br>
like thereby eliminating the problems and costs associated with the prior welding or<br>
brazing of dissimilar metals to each other. Additionally, the use of the fastener allows<br>
for easy in field servicing, repairs, and upgrades to the cooling device. Furthermore, if<br>
necessary, the heat spreader can be fixedly connected with the heat mass by<br>
preventing removal of the fastener and/or by welding, brazing, soldering the heat<br>
spreader to the heat mass.<br>
Moreover, a second material for the heat spreader can be selected for its<br>
superior thermal conductivity properties for efficient conduction and dissipation of<br>
waste heat from the component connected with the mounting surface of the heat<br>
spreader. Furthermore, the optional thermal sealant of the present invention solves the<br><br>
aforementioned problems caused by micro gaps between prior heat spreaders and<br>
heat sinks by sealing those micro gaps thereby reducing a thermal resistance between<br>
the heat spreader and the heat mass.<br>
Other aspects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent<br>
from the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
In the following detailed description and in the several figures of the drawings,<br>
like elements are identified with like reference numerals.<br>
As shown in the drawings for purpose of illustration, the present invention is<br>
embodied in a cooling device for dissipating heat from a component that is in thermal<br>
communication with a heat spreader of the cooling device. The thermal communication<br>
can be by direct contact between the heat spreader and the component or by an<br>
intermediate material (e.g a thermal interface material) positioned between the cooling<br>
device and the component as will be described below. The component can be any<br>
heat source, such as an electrical component, for example.<br>
The cooling device includes a heat mass made from a first material and<br>
including a base, a boss surrounded by a groove with the groove and the boss<br>
symmetrically positioned about an axis of the heat mass, a taper bore extending from<br>
the base to the boss, and an aperture extending from the boss to the taper bore. The<br>
boss has a convex arcuate surface profile and the groove has a concave arcuate<br>
surface profile.<br>
A fastener including a head and a threaded shaft is inserted through the aperture<br>
with the head in contact with the boss. A heat spreader made from a second material<br>
that is dissimilar to the first material includes a taper wall that complements the taper<br>
bore of the heat mass, a mounting surface adapted to thermally connect with the<br>
component, and a threaded aperture adapted to receive the threaded shaft of the<br>
fastener. Optionally, a thermal sealant that can be connected with the taper wall, the<br>
taper bore, or both the taper wall and the taper bore as will be described below.<br>
The heat spreader is inserted into the taper bore and the threaded shaft is<br>
threaded into the threaded aperture and the head of the fastener is turned to urge the<br>
taper wall into contact with the taper bore. The optional thermal sealant is operative to<br>
seal micro gaps between the taper bore and the taper wall so that a thermal resistance<br><br>
between the heat mass and the heat spreader is reduced.<br>
A plurality of vanes are in contact with the heat mass and surround the heat<br>
mass. The vanes are spaced apart from one another to define a primary slot between<br>
adjacent vanes that extends to the heat mass. The vanes have a surface area that<br>
increases in a radially outward direction from the axis and in a direction along the axis.<br>
A plurality of fins are formed in each vane by a secondary slot extending through a<br>
portion of each vane.<br>
The vanes include a top face and an aerodynamically profiled inner wall that<br>
includes a first portion extending from the groove and terminating at a second portion<br>
that extends to the top face. The inner wall defines a chamber that surrounds the<br>
groove. The vanes also include an outer wall having a surface profile that widens from<br>
the base to the top face. The surface profile includes a smooth curved portion, a draft<br>
portion, and a smooth radially outward portion.<br>
An air flow entering the chamber creates a three-dimensional air flow that<br>
dissipates heat from the cooling device. First, the air flow exits the primary slots and a<br>
bottom portion of the secondary slots in an exhaust flow that dissipates heat from the<br>
vanes and the fins. Second, the exhaust flow creates a low pressure region within the<br>
chamber that induces an intake flow into the chamber through a major portion of the<br>
secondary slots and a top portion of the primary slots thereby dissipating heat from the<br>
fins and the vanes. Third, the low pressure region induces a surface flow along the first<br>
and second portions of the inner wall so that the surface flow wets the groove and the<br>
boss as it passes over the groove and the boss to dissipate heat from the heat mass.<br>
The heat spreader is operative to increase a thermal conductivity of the cooling<br>
device by effectively spreading waste heat from the component to a larger surface area<br>
on the heat mass to reduce a heat concentration at an interface between the heat<br>
spreader and the heat mass. The second material of the heat spreader is dissimilar to<br>
the first material of the heat mass and is selected based on properties for superior heat<br>
conduction and heat dissipation as compared with similar properties for the first<br><br>
material of the heat mass.<br>
As an example, a component having a surface of 30.0 mm x 30.0 mm is in<br>
contact with the mounting surface of the heat spreader such that a thermal contact area<br>
of 30.0 mm * 30.0 mm = 900.0 mm2 is established between the component and the<br>
heat spreader. Because the second material of the heat spreader makes the heat<br>
spreader a better thermal conductor than the heat mass, the waste heat from the<br>
component is conducted through the heat spreader and is then transferred to the heat<br>
mass. However, the contact area between the taper bore of the heat mass and the<br>
taper walls of the heat spreader is greater than the aforementioned thermal contact<br>
area of 900.0 mm2 at the mounting surface. Therefore, the heat is spread out over a<br>
larger surface area and heat concentration per unit of area is reduced when compared<br>
to the heat concentration at the thermal contact area.<br>
If the component generates 80.0 W of waste heat, then heat concentration on the<br>
surface is 80.0 = 900.0 mm2 = 0.0889 W/mm2. If that waste heat is conducted more<br>
efficiently through the heat spreader due to a higher thermal conductivity of its second<br>
material, then the heat spreader can absorb more heat than the heat mass. Assuming<br>
for the purpose of this example, that the heat spreader conducts all of the heat from the<br>
component, then if the heat spreader has a diameter of 40.0 mm at the mounting<br>
surface, a diameter of 25.0 mm at the top, and a height of 20.0 mm, then a surface area<br>
of the heat spreader that is in contact with the heat mass is: (3.14) * (s) * ® + r) = 3.14<br>
* 21.31 (20 + 12.5) = 2174.68 mm2. Hence, heat concentration at the heat mass will<br>
be 80.0 W -r 2174.68 = 0.03678 W/ mm2. Accordingly, 0.03678 W/ mm2 at the heat<br>
mass is significantly less than the 0.0889 W/mm2 at the mounting surface of the heat<br>
spreader.<br>
In FIGS. 1a, 1b and 2a through 2c, a cooling device 10 for dissipating heat from<br>
a component (not shown) includes a heat mass 11, a boss 13, and a groove 15 that<br>
completely surrounds the boss 13. The boss 13 and the groove 15 are symmetrically<br>
positioned about an axis Z-Z of the heat mass 11. The boss 13 has a convex arcuate<br><br>
surface profile and the groove 15 has a concave arcuate surface profile. The arcuate<br>
profiles of the boss and the groove (13,15) blend into each other as illustrated by a<br>
dashed line a. The cooling device 10 further includes a base 17. The heat mass 11<br>
also includes a tape bore 14 extending from the base 17 to the boss 13 and an<br>
aperture 14a extending from the boss 13 to the taper bore 14. The aperture 14a is a<br>
through hole that is adapted to receive a shaft of a fastener (see FIG. 1b) as will be<br>
described below. The heat mass 11 is made from a first material. Optionally, a<br>
thermal sealant can be applied to the taper bare 14 as depicted by dashed arrows 44.<br>
In FIG. 1b, the cooling device 10 includes a heat spreader 40 that includes a<br>
mounting surface 19 adapted to thermally connect the heat spreader 40 with the<br>
component (not shown), a taper wall 41 having a profile (see reference numeral 41 p in<br>
FIGS. 7a and 7b) that complements the taper bore 14 of the heat mass 11, and a<br>
threaded aperture 43. A fastener 45 including a head 47 and a threaded shaft 49 is<br>
inserted through the aperture 14a with the head 47 in contact with the boss 13. The<br>
threaded shaft 49 is threaded into the threaded aperture 43 and the head 47 is turned<br>
(e.g. using a wrench, nut driver, Allen wrench,;hex driver, TORX® driver, etc.) to thread<br>
the fastener 45 into the heat spreader 40 thereby urging the taper wall 41 into contact<br>
with the taper bore 14.<br>
The heat spreader 40 is made from a second material that is dissimilar to the<br>
first material of the heat mass 11. The heat spreader 40 must be a better thermal<br>
conductor than the heat mass 11. Accordingly, the dissimilarity between the first and<br>
second materials can be accomplished using different materials for the heat mass 11<br>
and the heat spreader 40 or by using different alloys of the same material (e.g. copper<br>
(Cu) for the heat mass 11 and a copper alloy for the heat spreader 40) for the heat<br>
mass 11 and the heat spreader 40. As another example, aluminum (Al) or an<br>
aluminum alloy can be used for the heat mass 11 and copper (Cu) or a copper alloy for<br>
the heat spreader 40.<br><br>
The first material for the heat mass 11 can be a material including but not limited<br>
to aluminum (Al), an aluminum alloy, copper (Cu), a copper alloy, and a ceramic<br>
material.<br>
The second material for the heat spreader 40 can be a material including but not<br>
limited to copper (Cu), a copper alloy, silver (Ag), a silver alloy, silicon (Si), gold (Ag),<br>
graphite, a carbon fiber material, a carbon fiber reinforced material, and a gold alloy.<br>
Preferably, the fastener 45 should be made from a high tensile strength material<br>
so that a pulling load resulting from the tightening of the head 47 will not damage the<br>
fastener 45 or the threaded shaft 49. Furthermore, it is preferable for the material for<br>
the fastener 45 to be rust resistant. For example, a stainless steel material can be<br>
used to accomplish the tensile strength requirement and the rust resistance<br>
requirement. Preferably, the head 47 includes either an Allen key slot or a Hex/Square<br>
head slot in order to withstand an assembly torque required to tighten the fastener 45.<br>
The torque required to adequately tighten the fastener 45 will be application and<br>
material dependent; however, the torque can be in a range including but not limited to<br>
6.0 lbs-inch to about 500.0 lbs-inch.<br>
In some applications it may be desirable to prevent the fastener 45 from being<br>
removed after it has been tightened. For instance, to prevent loosening of the fastener<br>
45 which could result in a higher thermal resistance between the taper wall 41 of the<br>
heat spreader 40 and the taper bore 14 of the heat mass 11 because the taper wall 41<br>
is no longer urged into firm thermal contact with the taper bore 14. To that end, as one<br>
example, the fastener 45 can have a sealant/adhesive such as LOCTITE® applied to<br>
the threaded shaft 49 prior to insertion and tightening. Consequently, after the<br>
sealant/adhesive has set, the fastener 45 is fixedly connected with the heat mass 11,<br>
the heat spreader 40, or both the heat mass 11 and the heat spreader 40.<br>
Alternatively, the fastener 45 can be fixedly connected using a process including<br>
but not limited to welding, friction stir welding, soldering, or brazing to the head 47 to the<br><br>
boss 13 of the heat mass 11, for example.<br>
In FIG. 4a, a seam S between the head 47 and the boss 13 can be welded,<br>
soldered, or brazed to fixedly connect the heat spreader 40 to the heat mass 11 and/or<br>
to prevent removal of the fastener 45. As another alternative, a spring or lock washer<br>
can be used to secure the fastener 45 thereby preventing removal. The above are only<br>
examples and the present invention is not limited to the above means for preventing the<br>
fastener 45 from being removed after insertion into the threaded aperture 43.<br>
Depending on the type of material selected for the second material of the heat<br>
spreader 40, the material for the fastener 45 can be selected to be identical to the<br>
second material or it can be an alloy of the second material so that a thermal mass of<br>
the heat spreader 40 is increased and a contact area between the heat spreader 40<br>
and the heat mass 11 is also increased due the fastener 45 being in thermal contact<br>
with the threaded aperture 43, the aperture 14a, and the boss 13. As described herein,<br>
a thermal sealant can be applied to the head 47 and/or the threaded shaft 49 to seal<br>
micro voids and to reduce thermal resistance between the fastener 45, the heat mass<br>
11 and the heat spreader 40.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, to prevent removal of the heat<br>
spreader 40 from the heat mass 11, the heat spreader 40 is fixedly connected with the<br>
heat mass 11 using a process including but not limited to brazing, soldering, friction stir<br>
welding (FSW), or welding a portion of the heat spreader 40 to the heat mass 11. For<br>
example, in FIGS. 1b and 4b, a seam S between the mounting surface 19 and the<br>
base 17 can be welded, soldered, or brazed to fixedly connect the heat spreader 40<br>
with the heat mass 11. Another advantage to fixedly connecting the heat spreader 40<br>
to the heat mass 11 is that taper wall 41 and the taper bore 14 are held in thermal<br>
contact with each other thereby reducing thermal resistance. The fastener 45 can also<br>
be fixedly connected as described above.<br><br>
The method and compounds used for welding, soldering, or brazing will depend<br>
on the materials for the heat mass 11 and the heat spreader 45. For example, EN<br>
Plating is essential for soldering copper (Cu) to aluminum (Al).<br>
In FIG. 12d, an optional thermal sealant 44 is connected with the taper walls 41<br>
and can cover the top and side surfaces of the taper walls 41 as depicted by the<br>
dashed circles 44 in FIGS. 7a and 7b. The thermal sealant 44 is connected with the<br>
taper walls 41 prior to the above step of inserting the heat spreader 40 in the taper<br>
bore 14 and tightening the fastener 45. Alternatively, the thermal sealant 44 can be<br>
connected with the taper bore 14 (see FIG. 1a) or connected with both the taper bore<br>
14 and the taper walls 41. However, it may be easier to coat, deposit, or connect the<br>
thermal sealant 44 on the taper walls 41.<br>
Suitable materials for the thermal sealant 44 include but are not limited to a<br>
thermally conductive paste, a thermally conductive grease, silicone, paraffin, a phase<br>
transition material, graphite, a coated aluminum foil, and carbon fiber. The thermal<br>
sealant 44 can be screen printed, pasted, dip coated, dispensed by a tool, or applied<br>
with a brush to the taper walls 41 of the heat spreader 40, for example.<br>
In FIG. 1a, a plurality of vanes 21 are in contact with the heat mass 11 and the<br>
vanes 21 are spaced apart from one another tp define a primary slot P (see FIGS. 2a<br>
and 2c) between adjacent vanes 21. The vanes 21 have a surface area that increases<br>
in a radially outward direction from the axis Z-Z as indicated by the dashed arrow r. At<br>
least a portion of the vanes 21 have a surface area that increases in a direction along<br>
the axis Z-Z as shown by dashed arrow y.<br>
Preferably, the primary slot P extends to the heat mass 11 and the primary slot P<br>
includes a first arcuate surface profile 21a along the heat mass 11. The first arcuate<br>
profile 21a terminates on a plane H-H (see FIG. 1a). It is also preferable that the vanes<br>
21 are equidistantly spaced apart from each another. By extending the primary slot P<br>
to the heat mass 11, air flow through the vanes 21 also wets the heat mass 11 to<br><br>
dissipate heat therefrom. The first arcuate surface profile 21a can be an arc having a<br>
radius from about 38.0 millimeters to about 45.0 millimeters.<br>
One advantage of the cooling device 10, is that a fan (not shown) for generating<br>
an air flow is not mounted on the heat mass 11. Consequently, the vanes 21 can extend<br>
deep into the heat mass 11 (as illustrated by arrow e) and the depth of the vanes 21<br>
provides a large surface area for efficient dissipation of waste heat and exposes the<br>
heat mass 11 to an air flow (see FIGS. 3a and 3b) that wets over the boss 13 and the<br>
groove 15 so that additional waste heat can be dissipated from the heat mass 11.<br>
The vanes 21 also include a top face 29, an aerodynamically profiled inner wall<br>
26	including a first portion 25 that extends from the groove 15 and terminates at a<br>
second portion 27 that extends to the top face 29. The first portion 25 blends with the<br>
arcuate profile of the groove 15 as illustrated by dashed line b and the first portion 25<br>
blends with the second portion 27 as illustrated by dashed line C. The second portion<br>
27	blends with the top face 29 as illustrated by dashed line d. The inner wall 26 can<br>
include additional portions and the present invention is not to be construed as being<br>
limited to the first and second portions (25,27). The inner wall 26 defines a chamber<br>
30 that surrounds the groove 15.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, as illustrated in FIGS. 1a, 1b, and<br>
2c, the first portion 25 of the inner wall 26 is a slope surface and the second portion 27<br>
of the inner wall 26 is a concave arcuate surface. The sloped and concave arcuate<br>
surfaces aerodynamically interact with an air flow into the chamber 30 so that the air<br>
flows along the first and second portions (25,27) of the inner wall 26 and wet over the<br>
groove and the boss (15,13) to dissipate heat from the heat mass 11 as will be<br>
described below in reference to FIGS. 3a and 3b.<br>
The first portion 25 can be inclined at an angle ψ with respect to the axis Z-Z as<br>
illustrated in FIG. 1a. The angle ψ can be in a range from about 15.0 degrees to about<br><br>
75.0 degrees. If the vanes 21 have a tangential orientation with a circle about the axis<br>
Z-Z as will be discussed below in reference to FIG. 6, then the first portion 25 will have<br>
a tangential orientation with the groove 15. The angle ψ will vary based primarily on an<br>
output of a fan (not shown) in cubic feet per minute (CFM).<br>
In FIG. 1b, the vanes 21 further include an outer wall 32 having a surface profile<br>
that widens from a bottom 11a of the heat mass 11 to the top face 29 and includes a<br>
smooth curved portion 33, a draft portion 35, and a smooth radially outward portion 37.<br>
The draft portion 35 an be substantially parallel to the axis Z-Z or the draft portion 35<br>
can be inclined at an angle A.<br>
In FIGS. 2a through 2c, the vanes 21 include at least one secondary slot S that<br>
extends through a portion of each vane 21 to define a plurality of fins 23 (two are<br>
shown) in each vane 21. By splitting at least a portion of each vane 21 into a plurality of<br>
fins 23, the available surface area for dissipating waste heat is increased and the<br>
secondary slot S provides an additional air flow path between the fins 23 that further<br>
increases waste heat dissipation.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the secondary slot S extends to<br>
the heat mass 11 and the secondary slot S includes a second arcuate profile 23a (see<br>
dashed line in FIG. 1a) along the heat mass 11. The second arcuate profile 23a<br>
terminates on the plane H-H. By extending the secondary slot S to the heat mass 11,<br>
the airflow through the fins 23 also wets the heat mass 11 to dissipate heat therefrom.<br>
The second arcuate profile 23a can be an arc having a radius from about 31.0<br>
millimeters to about 38.0 millimeters.<br>
Reference points for a center of the above mentioned radiuses (i.e. for 21a and<br>
23a) will be positioned outside the cooling device 10 and the actual location of the<br>
center will depend on the arcs radius. However, the position of the center of the radius<br>
will be at least about 5.0 millimeters out side of the cooling device 10 to accommodate<br>
a cutting tool used in a machining process for making the cooling device 10. The<br><br>
position of the center of the radius is a limitation imposed by a machining process that<br>
uses cutting wheels to form the vanes 21 and the fins 23. If the vanes 21 and the fins 23<br>
can be diecasted or impact forged, then the arc radius could be reduced and the<br>
position of the center of the radius could come inside the cooling device 10. The<br>
cooling device 10 can be made amendable to a diecasted or impact forged process<br>
by reducing the number of vanes 21.<br>
In FIGS. 3a and 3b, heat dissipation by an air flow F entering the chamber 30 is<br>
illustrated. A portion of the air flow F exits the chamber 30 through the primary slots P<br>
and a bottom portion of the secondary slots S (not shown) in an exhaust flow E. The<br>
exhaust flow E passes over the vanes 21 and the fins 23 and dissipates heat therefrom.<br>
A low pressure region AP is created within the chamber 30 by the exhaust flow E.<br>
Consequently, the low pressure region AP induces an intake flow I into the chamber 30<br>
through a major portion of the secondary slots S and a top portion of the primary slots P<br>
(not shown) thereby dissipating heat from the fins 23 and the vanes 21. The low<br>
pressure region AP also induces a surface flow B along the aerodynamically shaped<br>
first and second portions (25,27) of the inner wall 26. The surface flow B passes over<br>
the arcuate profiles of the groove and boss (15,13) thereby dissipating heat from the<br>
heat mass 11 as the surface flow B circulates back towards (i.e. it is a balancing air<br>
flow) the low pressure region AP. Therefore, another advantage of the cooling device<br>
10 is that waste heat is efficiently dissipated by a three-dimensional air flow<br>
(comprising E, I, and B) through the vanes 21 and the fins 23, and passing over the<br>
groove and boss (15,13).<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the arcuate surface profile of the<br>
boss 13 includes but is not limited to a profile of a sphere, a frustum of a sphere, a<br>
cone, and a frustum of a cone. In FIG. 1a, the boss 13 has a conical surface profile. On<br>
the other hand, the surface profile could also be spherical. In FIG. 1b, the boss 13 has<br>
a surface profile that is a frustum of a cone due to a substantially flat head 47 of the<br>
fastener 45. However, depending on the shape of the head 47, the combined shape of<br>
the head 47 and the boss 13 can result in a conical surface profile. The boss 13 could<br><br>
also have a surface profile that is a frustum of a sphere.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the arcuate surface profile of the<br>
groove 15 includes but is not limited to a semi-circular profile as illustrated in FIGS. 1a<br>
and 1b. Preferably, the boss 13 has a diameter dB (see FIG. 1a) that is less than a<br>
diameter of a hub 79 of a fan 70 (see FIG. 9). The groove 15 should have a radius rG<br>
(see FIG. 9) that provides a smooth change in air flow direction for the surface flow B<br>
as it transitions from the first portion 25 to the groove 15 so that the surface flow B flows<br>
over the groove 15 and onto the boss 13 (see FIG. 3a). As mentioned previously, the<br>
boss 13, the groove 15, and the inner wall 26 (i.e. 25 and 27) can be formed by forging,<br>
machining, or diecasting.<br>
In FIGS. 5a and 5b, the vanes 21 can be inclined at angle with respect to the<br>
axis Z-Z. In FIG. 5a, the vanes 21 are inclined at an angle β measured between a line<br>
21c and the axis Z-Z. The line 21c is measured along the primary slot P of the fins 23.<br>
The inclination of the angle β includes but is not limited to a range from about 0 (zero)<br>
degrees to about 25.0 degrees. In another embodiment of the present invention as<br>
illustrated in FIG. 5b, the angle at which the vanes 21 are inclined with respect to the<br>
axis Z-Z includes a first angle δ1 measured between a line 21 d and the axis Z-Z and a<br>
second angle δ2 measured between a line 21 e and the axis Z-Z. The first angle δ1 is<br>
measured along the smooth radially outward portion 37 of the fins 23. The inclination of<br>
the first angle δ1 includes but is not limited to a range from about 0 (zero) degrees to<br>
about 25.0 degrees. The second angle δ2 is measured along the smooth curved<br>
portion 33 of the fins 23. The inclination of the second angle δ2 includes but is not<br>
limited to a range from about 5.0 degrees to about 18.0 degrees. Because the fins 23<br>
are defined by the vanes 21, the fins 23 and the vanes 21 are inclined at the angles (β,<br>
δ1 and δ2) as described above.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention as illustrated in FIG. 6, the vanes 21<br>
have a tangential orientation with respect to a circle Ct (shown in dashed line) centered<br><br>
about the axis Z-Z (shown as a "+") and having a predetermined diameter. In FIG. 6, an<br>
example of the tangential orientation of the vanes 21 is illustrated by a plurality of the<br>
vanes 21 having tangent lines t drawn through their primary slots P and tangentially<br>
crossing a perimeter of the circle Ct. A line M through the axis Z-Z (shown as a M+")<br>
and a parallel line N that also is tangential to the circle Ct define a radius R<br>
therebetween and the predetermined diameter of the circle Ct is two times the radius<br>
R (that is: Ct = 2 * R). The predetermined diameter includes but is not limited to a<br>
range from about 3.0 millimeters to about 12.0 millimeters.<br>
In FIGS. 5a, 5b, and 6, at least a portion of the top face 29 of the vanes 21<br>
includes a substantially planar portion 29a (shown as a dashed line). Preferably the<br>
substantially planar portion 29a covers the entirety of the top face 29 as illustrated in<br>
FIG. 6. One advantage of the substantially planar portion 29a of the top face 29 is that<br>
a fan can be mounted on the substantially planar portion 29a.<br>
In FIGS. 4a and 4b the cooling device 10 is depicted with the heat spreader 40<br>
already connected with the taper bore 14 and the fastener 45 inserted in the aperture<br>
14a with the head 47 in contact with the boss 13. The head 47 of the fastener can be<br>
substantially flat as illustrated or the head 47 can have a profile that complements the<br>
shape of the boss 13 in order to streamline the air flow F through the chamber 30.<br>
In FIG. 4b, the mounting surface 19 of the heat spreader 40 is illustrated as<br>
being substantially flush with the base 17 of the heat mass 11. However, the mounting<br>
surface 19 need not be flush with the base 17. For example, the mounting surface 19<br>
can be inset from the base 17 or the mounting surface 19 can extend outward of the<br>
base 17.<br>
In FIGS. 4c and 4d, the heat spreader is not mounted to the taper bore 14 of the<br>
heat mass 11. The taper bore 14 includes an upper portion denoted as 14t where the<br>
aperture 14a terminates. As illustrated, the portion 14t is substantially planar (i.e. flat);<br>
however, the portion 14t can be arcuate or sloped and an actual shape of the portion<br><br>
14t will depend on the shape of the heat spreader 40 because the shape of the taper<br>
bore 14 and the taper walls 41 of the heat spreader 40 should be complementary in<br>
order to facilitate mating the heat spreader 40 to the taper bore 14 and to increase a<br>
contact area between the heat spreader 40 and the heat mass 11. A larger contact<br>
area increases heat transfer from the heat spreader 40 to the heat mass 11 and<br>
distributes the transferred heat over a larger surface area.<br>
in FIGS. 7a and 7b, the heat spreader 40 includes a taper wall 41 having a<br>
profile 41 p that is a sloped profile such that the heat spreader has a shape of a cone.<br>
In FIG. 1b and 7b, the shape of the heat spreader 40 is that of a frustum of a cone<br>
because a top surface 411 is flat. The top surface 411 complements the portion 14t of<br>
the taper bore 14 and the taper wall 41 complements the taper bore 14 (see FIG. 4c).<br>
However, the shape of the heat spreader 40 and the taper bore 14 are not<br>
limited to the shapes illustrated herein. In FIG. 7c, the heat spreader 40 includes a<br>
taper wall 41 with an arcuate profile and a top surface 411 that is flat. In FIG. 7d, the<br>
heat spreader 40 includes a taper wall 41 with an arcuate profile. In either case, the<br>
taper bore 14 would include a complementary arcuate profile.<br>
In FIG. 8, a fan 70 is positioned to be mounted on the substantially planar portion<br>
29a of the top face 29. The fan 70 generates an air flow (see reference letter F in FIG.<br>
3a) into the chamber 30 of the cooling device 10 in a direction indicated by dashed<br>
arrow af. A shroud 73 houses a rotor hub 79 having a plurality of fan blades 77. The<br>
rotor hub 79 is rotatably mounted on a stator 71 and the fan blades 77 rotate in a<br>
direction indicated by arrow IT. Several holes 75 through the shroud 77 are adapted to<br>
receive a fastener 89.<br>
A mounting ring 80 including a frame 81 and several mounting fixtures 83 is<br>
abutted against a surface 37a of the smooth radially outward portion 37. The diameter<br>
of the smooth radially outward portion 37 at the surface 37a is greater than an inside<br>
diameter of the frame 81 of the mounting ring 80 so that the frame 81 can be urged into<br>
snug contact with the smooth radially outward portion 37 without sliding off of the vanes<br><br>
and fins (21,23). The only way to slide the mounting ring 80 off of the vanes and fins<br>
(21,23) is in the direction of the base 17 because the diameter of the vanes and fins<br>
(21,23) narrows in that direction.<br>
The mounting fixtures 83 receive the fastener 89 and optionally an additional<br>
fastener 87 such that the fan 70 is firmly connected with the top face 29 as illustrated in<br>
FIG. 8. The fasteners (87, 89) can be a nut and bolt as shown or another type of<br>
fastener. Preferably, a rotational axis B-B of the fan 70 is colinear with the axis Z-Z of<br>
the cooling device 10 when the fan 70 is connected with the mounting ring 80.<br>
Examples of suitable materials for the mounting ring 80 include but are not limited to<br>
metals, plastics, or ceramics. The mounting ring 80 can be produced by machining,<br>
casting, molding, and pressure diecasting.<br>
Although the previous discussion has focused on fasteners as one means of<br>
connecting the mounting ring 80 with the fan 70, the present invention is not to be<br>
construed as being limited to fasteners only. For instance, a latch on the fan could mate<br>
with a complementary latching profile on the mounting ring 80. Because the mounting<br>
ring 80 can be formed by an injection molding process, many possibilities exist for<br>
effectuating the mounting of the fan 70 to the mounting ring 80 and fasteners are an<br>
example of one of those many possibilities.<br>
In FIG. 8, the fan 70 is shown mounted on the substantially planar portion 29a of<br>
the top face 29. For purposes of illustration, only one set of fasteners (87,89) are<br>
shown installed through the holes 75 and the mounting fixtures 83. A power lead 72 of<br>
the fan 70 is positioned so that it is not necessary for the power lead 72 to be routed<br>
through or to come into contact with the vanes or fins (21, 23). Although shown with only<br>
two wires (+ and -) the power lead 72 can include additional wires such as one or more<br>
additional wires for communicating with a circuit that controls the fan 70 (e.g turning fan<br>
70 on or off, or controlling fan speed) or for determining if the fan 70 is operating<br>
properly.<br><br>
Although only one fan 70 is shown in FIG. 8, two or more fans 70 can be<br>
stacked one upon the other with the holes 75 aligned so that a longer fastener 89 can<br>
be inserted through the holes 75 an into the mounting fixtures 83 of the mounting ring<br>
80. Therefore, another advantage of the cooling device 10 of the present invention is<br>
that a plurality of fans can be used to generate the air flow F into the chamber 30. The<br>
use of more than one fan 70 allows for redundant cooling if one or more fans should fail.<br>
In contrast, prior fan assisted heat sinks in which the fan is mounted in a cavity formed<br>
by the fins, it is very difficult to mount more than one fan in the cavity. Moreover,<br>
because the fan 70 is not mounted in the chamber 30, the risks associated with routing<br>
the power lead 72 through the vanes 21 is eliminated because the fan 70 is mounted on<br>
the top face 29.<br>
An additional advantage to mounting the fan 70 on the top face is that if one or<br>
more of the vanes and fins (21,23) are damaged, the blades 77 will not come into<br>
contact with a damaged vane or fin (21,23); therefore, potential damage to the blades<br>
77 or the fan 70 is eliminated. In FIGS. 2a, 2b and 3b, a notch 31 can be formed in the<br>
fins 23. The notch 31 can have a shape the complements an indexing tab (not shown)<br>
on the shroud 73 so that when the fan 70 is mounted on the top face 29 the indexing tab<br>
mates with the notch 31. The notch 31 can be used to ensure proper orientation of the<br>
fan 70 with respect to the cooling device 10 and/or to prevent relative movement<br>
between the shroud 73 and the cooling device 10.<br>
In FIG. 9, the tangential orientation of the vanes 2, as was described above in<br>
reference to FIG. 61 can be determined by two factors. A first factor is a height h1 from<br>
the top of the boss 13 to the top face 29. For example, when the height h1 is about 7.5<br>
millimeters, the vanes 21 can be tangential to the circle C, having a diameter of about<br>
6.5 millimeters. On the other hand, a second factor is a height h2 from the top of the<br>
boss 13 to a bottom 76 of the fan blades 77. For instance, the diameter of the circle<br>
Ct can be from about 3.0 millimeters to about 12.0 millimeters when the height h2<br>
varies from about 2.0 millimeters to about 8.5 millimeters. The above are examples<br>
only and the heights (h1, h2) are not to be construed as being limited to the ranges set<br><br>
forth above.<br>
The angle (β, δ1 and δ2) at which the vanes 21 are inclined relative to the axis<br>
Z-Z as described above can be set to substantially match or closely approximate a<br>
pitch angle θ of the fan blades 77 as illustrated in FIG. 9. On the other hand, the angles<br>
(β, δ1, and δ2) can be set so that they are within a predetermined range of the pitch<br>
angle θ. For example, the pitch angle 0 can be about 15.0 degrees and the angle β<br>
can be about 17.0 degrees or the pitch angle θ can be about 12.0 degrees and the<br>
angle δ1 can be about 10.0 degrees and the angle δ2 can be about 8.0 degrees.<br>
Another advantage of the cooling device 10 of the present invention is that the<br>
aforementioned tangential orientation and inclination of the vanes 21 and the<br>
aerodynamically profiled first and second portions (25,27) of the inner wall 26 provide<br>
a low resistance path to the air flow F thereby reducing airflow shock noise.<br>
Additionally, because of the low resistance path, the fan 70 can be a lower RPM fan<br>
which produces lower noise levels and can be operated on less power than a higher<br>
RPM fan.<br>
The cross-sectional view of the cooling device 10 in FIG. 9 also depicts<br>
radiuses for the arcuate shapes of the boss 13, the groove 15, the second portion 27,<br>
the first arcuate surface profile 21a, and the second arcuate surface profile 23a.<br>
The arcuate profile of the boss 13 can have a radius rB that is dependent in part<br>
on a desired thermal mass for the boss 13. For instance, for a thermal mass of about<br>
50.0 grams, the radius rB for the boss 13 is about 15.0 millimeters. Similarly, the<br>
arcuate profile of the groove 15 has a radius rG of about 2.5 millimeters. The actual<br>
values for rB and rG will be application dependent and the above values are examples<br>
only. The present invention is not to be construed as being limited to the values set<br>
forth above.<br><br>
Furthermore, the arcuate surface profiles for the first and second arcuate surface<br>
profiles (21a, 23a) have a radius of rv and rF respectively. For example, the radius rv<br>
can be from about 38.0 millimeters to about 45.0 millimeters and the radius rF can be<br>
from about 31.0 millimeters to about 38.0 millimeters. The second portion 27 of the<br>
inner wall 26 has a radius rc. The radius rc can be about 20.0 millimeters, for<br>
example. The actual values for rv, rF and rG will be application dependent and the<br>
above values are examples only. The present invention is not to be construed as being<br>
limited to the values set forth above.<br>
The above mentioned radiuses can be determined by a machining process<br>
used to form the cooling device 10. Reference points for the radiuses need not be<br>
relative to a point on the cooling device 10. The radiuses rB, rG and rc can be formed<br>
by a forging process. They can also be machined or produced using a diecasting<br>
process. The radiuses rv and rF can be formed by machining after forging the cooling<br>
device 10 from a blank or material.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention as illustrated in FIG. 10, a fan 74<br>
without a shroud (i.e. it lacks the shroud 73 of FIGS. 7 and 8) is positioned over the top<br>
face 29 of the cooling device 10 by a space frame 90. A stator 71 of the fan 74 is<br>
connected with the space frame 90 and a plurality of arms 91 span the width of the top<br>
face 29 and fingers 93 at the ends of the arms 91 clamp the space frame 90 to the<br>
cooling device 10 approximately at the surface 37a of the smooth radially outward<br>
portion 37. Consequently, a hub 79 and blades 77 of the fan 74 are positioned over the<br>
chamber 30 so that an air flow from the fan 74 can enter the chamber 30 as was<br>
described above. Moreover, power leads 72 from the fan 74 can be routed away from<br>
the fins and vanes (21, 23) of the cooling device 10 and away from the fan blades 77.<br>
The space frame 90 can be integrally formed with the stator 71 or the space<br>
frame 90 can be made from a metal or plastic material, preferably plastic because it is<br>
electrically non-conductive.<br><br>
In another embodiment of the present invention as illustrated in FIG. 13, the base<br>
17 of the cooling device 10 includes at least two projections 22 that extend outward of<br>
the base 17. A thermal interface material 24 is in contact with the mounting surface 19<br>
of the heat spreader 40 and is positioned between the projections 22. The projections<br>
22 protect the thermal interface material 25 from damage when the mounting surface<br>
19 is in contact with a component 50. The projections 22 can also protect the thermal<br>
interface material from damage during manufacturing, transit, and/or handling. The<br>
thermal interface material 24 is in contact with a component face 51 of the component<br>
50 and the thermal interface material 24 provides a thermally conductive path for waste<br>
heat from the component face 51 to be communicated through the mounting surface 19<br>
and into the heat mass 11. The projections 22 prevent the thermal interface material 24<br>
from being crushed, deformed, or otherwise damaged when the cooling device 10 is<br>
mounted on the component 50 and/or during manufacturing, transit, and handling.<br>
The projections 22 extend outward of the base 17 by a distance dp The distance<br>
dp will be application dependent and will depend on among other things a thickness of<br>
the thermal interface material 24. The distance dp can be from about 0.2 millimeters to<br>
about 1.0 millimeters. Preferably, the mounting surface 19 is a substantially planar<br>
surface (i.e. it is substantially flat) and the mounting surface 19 is substantially<br>
perpendicular to the axis Z-Z (i.e. about 90.0 degrees, see angle α in FIG. 10).<br>
Additionally, the thermal interface material 24 seals micro voids (i.e. gaps)<br>
between the mounting surface 19 and the component face 51 thereby enhancing<br>
thermal transfer from the component 50 to the cooling device 10. Suitable materials for<br>
the thermal interface material 24 include but are not limited to a thermally conductive<br>
paste, a thermally conductive grease, silicone, paraffin, a phase transition material,<br>
graphite, a coated aluminum foil, and carbon fiber. The thermal interface material 24<br>
can be screen printed or pasted to the mounting surface 19 of the heat spreader 40, for<br>
example.<br><br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, as illustrated in FIGS. 11 and<br>
12d, the mounting surface 19 of the heat spreader 40 can include the above mentioned<br>
projections 22 that extend outward of the mounting surface 19 by the distance dp and<br>
are operative to protect the thermal interface material 24 from damage as described<br>
above. Preferably, either the base 17 or the mounting surface 19 include the<br>
projections 22.<br>
In FIG. 13, a system for dissipating heat 100 includes the cooling device 10 as<br>
described above, a fan 70 connected with the top face 29 as described above, a<br>
component 50 to be cooled by the cooling device 10, and a base mount 300. A<br>
component face 51 of the component 50 is in contact with the mounting surface 19, or<br>
as described above in reference to FIG. 11, a thermal interface material 24 may be<br>
positioned intermediate between the component face 51 and the mounting surface 19.<br>
In either case, waste heat is thermally communicated through the component<br>
face 51 into the mounting surface 19 either by direct contact between the component<br>
face 51 and the mounting surface 19 or via the thermal interface material 24. The base<br>
mount 300 urges the mounting surface 19 and the component face 51 into contact with<br>
each other so that heat from the component is thermally communicated into the cooling<br>
device 10.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the mounting surface 19 of the heat<br>
spreader includes the projections 22 that extend outward of the mounting surface 19<br>
and the thermal interface material 24 is positioned intermediate between the<br>
projections 22 as described above in reference to FIGS. 11 and 12d. Alternatively, the<br>
base 17 can include the projections 22 that extend outward of the base 17 and the<br>
thermal interface material 24 can be connected with the mounting surface 19 and<br>
positioned intermediate between the projections 22 as described above.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the component 50 is carried by<br>
a support unit 99. The support unit includes but is not limited to a socket, a substrate,<br>
and a PC board. The socket can be mounted to a PC board in a manner that is well<br><br>
understood in the electronics art. For instance the component can be a micro<br>
processor that is inserted into a socket that is solder onto a PC board. The base<br>
mount 300 is removably connected with the support unit 99.<br>
On the other hand, the support unit can be a PC board on which the component<br>
50 is soldered or otherwise electrically connected with. Although the present invention<br>
has described the cooling device 10 in terms of its usefulness in dissipating waste heat<br>
from electronic components, the cooling device 10 and the system 100 are not to be<br>
construed as being limited to cooling electronic devices exclusively. Accordingly, the<br>
component 50 can be any heat generating device from which it is desirable to remove<br>
heat. To that end, the support unit 99 need not be a PC board or a socket. The support<br>
unit 99 can be a substrate that carries the component 50. The component 50 may or<br>
may not be in electrical communication with the substrate.<br>
In FIG. 13, the base mount 300 is a base plate such as the type used for<br>
mounting a heat sink to a PC board. A plurality of holes 300a formed in the base mount<br>
300 and a plurality of holes 99a formed in the support unit 99 receive fasteners (87,89)<br>
that removably connect the base mount 300 with the support unit 99. Although a nut and<br>
bolt are shown, other fasteners and other fastening methods can be used to removably<br>
connect the base mount 300 with the support unit 99.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the system 100 can include a<br>
shroudless fan 74 as was described above in reference to FIG. 10. The shroudless fan<br>
74 includes the space frame 90 for supporting the fan 74 and for positioning the<br>
shroudless fan 74 adjacent to the top face 29 and over the chamber 30 so that the air<br>
flow af enters the chamber 30. As previously mentioned, the space frame 90 includes<br>
a plurality of arms 91 that span the width of the top face 29 and fingers 93 on the arms<br>
91 clamp the space frame 90 to the smooth radially outward portion 37 of the outer wall<br>
32.<br>
Preferably, the heat mass 11, the base 17, and the vanes 21 are<br>
homogeneously formed. An extrusion process can be used to homogeneously form the<br><br>
heat mass 11, the base 17, and the vanes 21. The cooling device 10 can be made<br>
from a variety of thermally conductive materials including but not limited to copper,<br>
electrolytic copper, aluminum, and alloys of aluminum and copper, ceramics, and<br>
silicon (Si) substrates. An exemplary material for the cooling device 10 is aluminum<br>
1060 or aluminum 6063. For example, the heat mass 11, the base 17, and the vanes<br>
21 can be homogeneously formed from an extruded rod or from a forged nutshell.<br>
The cooling device 10 can be manufactured by a variety of processes including<br>
but not limited to those listed below. First, the cooling device 10 can completely<br>
machining from an extruded bar stock. Second, a diecasting, forging, or pressing<br>
process can be used to form either one or both of the internal and external features (26,<br>
32) of the cooling device 10, followed by a machining process to form the base 17, the<br>
mounting surface 19, the projections 22, the cylindrical neck 18, and the attachment<br>
groove 18g. Next cutting wheels can be used to form the primary P and secondary S<br>
slots for the vanes 21 and the fins 23 respectively, followed by deburring and<br>
degreasing. Third, impact forging the complete cooling device 10 including the vanes<br>
21 and fins 23. Fourth, pressure diecasting the complete cooling device 10 including<br>
the vanes 21 and fins 23.<br>
An exemplary model of the cooling device 10 was created with a diameter of 65<br>
mm at the top face 29 and a diameter of 50 mm at the bottom surface 11a of the heat<br>
mass 11. The base 17 had a diameter of 40 mm and height of 6.5 mm from the bottom<br>
surface 11a. The cooling device 10 had a total height from the mounting surface 19 to<br>
the top face 29 of about 38 mm. The heat mass 11 had a total height of about 22 mm<br>
from the mounting surface 19 to a top of the boss 13. The smooth curved portion 33<br>
had a radius of about 33 mm and the draft portion 35 had a diameter of about 63 mm.<br>
Moreover, for the fan 70, a Delta® fan, model number EFB0612VHB, and<br>
having dimensions of 60 mm x 60 mm x 15 mm in length, breadth, and height was<br>
mounted to the cooling device 10 as illustrated in FIG. 14. The cooling device 10 was<br>
then mounted on a processor carried by a PGA 370 connector that was soldered onto<br>
a mother board. The processor had a top surface of approximately 9 mm x 11 mm and<br><br>
a thermal output of 36 watts. The cooling device 10 as described in this paragraph was<br>
capable of maintaining the case temperature of the processor at 38.0 degrees Celsius<br>
at an ambient temperature of 25.0 degrees Celsius. Based on the above<br>
temperatures, a temperature difference of 13.0 degrees Celsius for 36 watts of thermal<br>
power results in an estimated thermal resistance for the cooling device 10 of 0.3611<br>
degrees Celsius per watt (13.0 degrees Celsius / 36 watts = 0.3611).<br>
Although several embodiments of the present invention have been disclosed<br>
and illustrated, the invention is not limited to the specific forms or arrangements of parts<br>
so described and illustrated. The invention is only limited by the claims.<br><br>
