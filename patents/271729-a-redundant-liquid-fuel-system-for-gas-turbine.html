A typical fuel oil system generally consist of:<br>
	-	a Fuel Oil Stop Valve;<br>
	-	a fuel Oil Pump driven by Accessory Gear Box of the Gas Turbine;<br>
	-	a Bypass Valve;<br>
	-	a Servo Valve;<br>
	-	a Trip Valve;<br>
	-	a Duplex Filter;<br>
	-	a How Divider;<br>
	-	a Selector Valve;<br>
	-	Piping circuit having the necessary instrumentation, and<br>
	-	a Control Panel<br>
In a typical liquid fuel system mounted on an accessory base, fuel is received<br>
from a forwarding system at a predetermined point. The fuel flows through the<br>
stop valve, the accessory gear box driven by the main fuel pump, a high-<br>
pressure filter and free wheeling flow divider. The flow divider meters essentially<br>
equal fuel to each combustor. The total fuel flow is controlled by a bypass valve<br>
around the main fuel pump which is modulated by the gas turbine control<br>
system.<br>
Objects of the Invention:<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to propose a redundant liquid<br>
fuel system which eliminates the disadvantages of the prior art.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose a redundant liquid fuel<br>
system which achieves the dual role of normal operation as an on-base system<br>
and substitute operation in the case of failure of the on-base system, thereby<br>
maintaining a continuous operation of the gas turbine.<br>
An yet another object of the present invention is to propose a redundant liquid<br>
fuel system which eliminates the requirement of a forced feed lub oil system.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to propose a redundant liquid fuel<br>
system which is simple in construction and cheaper in manufacturing.<br><br>

Summary of the Invention:<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a redundant liquid fuel system adaptable to gas<br>
turbines for pumping, metering and supplying pressurizes fuel via fuel nozzles to<br>
the combustors of the gas turbines, the system comprising a skid base for<br>
accommodating the devices of the system. A solenoid operated fuel stop valve is<br>
provided being operably connected to a protection means for shutting of fuel<br>
supply to the turbine during shutdown of the plant. A three-screw fuel pump and<br>
motor assembly is provided for pumping the fuel including metering and delivery<br>
of the pressurized and measured fuel. A hydraulic operated bypass valve is<br>
arranged for modulating high pressure fuel flow from the pump . A liquid fuel<br>
flow divider for equally distributing input fuel flow to the gas turbine is disposed.<br>
The redundant liquid fuel system of the invention attains significance on two<br>
fronts viz. availability and maintainability of the gas turbine. The Redundant<br>
liquid fuel system supplements the on-base system under normal conditions and<br>
assumes the role of a substitute system in the event of e failure of the on-base<br>
system. This ensures a continuous availability of the gas turbine.<br>
Since at any given point of time, only one of the systems will be operational,<br>
maintenance can be carried out on the other one even while the gas turbine is<br>
running. This is particularly valid if the downtime required of replacements of<br>
components like pump and flow divider due to failure of any of these is<br>
constituted. Thus the maintainability of the gas turbine is also improved<br>

	-	a plurality of etectrical junction boxes, conduit and wining.<br>
	-	a three-way valve (4) connected to the hydraulic operated stop valve (3),<br>
		the fuel pump (5), and to the standard fuel system.<br>
The base assembly (1) incorporates the following features:<br>
	a.	Welded Structure made From low Carbon steel material.<br>
	b.	Foundation anchor bolt attachment holes,foundation hardware (bolts,nuts<br>
		washers etc.) and mounting pads.<br>
	c.	Lifting lugs to allow uniform lift of the entire skid by means of cables and<br>
		spreader bars.<br>
	d.	The base provides rigid support for the pump-motor<br>
		assemble, filters,vaIves, flow divider, piping and other skid quipment.<br>
	e.	The floor plate is constructed with a durable, rigid, slip-resistant material<br>
		(e.g. checkered carbon steel ptate painted with sand bearing epoxy of<br>
		galvanized grating).<br>
2.	A Solenoid Operated Fuel Stop Valve (2)<br>
		The solenoid-operated fuel oil stop valve (2) is an emergency valve,<br>
		operated from a protection system (not shown),which shuts off the supply<br>
		of the fuel to the turbine(10) during normal or emergency shutdowns.<br>
3.	A Hydraulic Operated Fuel Stop Valve (3)<br>
		The fuel oil stop valve (3) is an emergency valve, operated from the<br>
		protected system, which shuts off the supply of the fuel to the turbine<br>
		(10) during normal or emergency shutdowns.<br><br>
7<br>
	When an etectric trip occurs, the solenoid valve (2), causes dump valve<br>

	(8) and entering into the combustion chambers of the Gas Turbine (10).<br>
7.	A Liquid Fuel Flow Dividder(B).<br>
	The flow divider (8) equally distributes input fuel flow to the combustion<br>
	nozzles of the Gas Turbine (10).<br>
8.	A Selector Valve (5).<br>
	A selector valve (9) with pressure gauges is provided at the output of the<br>
