				<td>FIELD  OF   THE    INVENTION<br>
The        present      invention      relates      to     a     herbal         pharmaceutical preparation   for   the   treatment   of   ieucoderma. BACKGROUND  OF   THE    INVENTION<br>
Leucoderma or vitiligo is a disease commonly associated with failure of pigmentation of the skin. Para-ami nobenzoic acid, panthothenic acid and biotin are alleged to function in the process deal ing with pigmentation of the skin. It is true that gray-haired condition has been produced in rats, dogs, guinea-pigs and silver foxes on certain types of deficient diets: but it seems a far cry from this experi mental procedure to the process of aging as it occurs in human being. An enzyme tyrosinase converts   Tyrosine   into   melanin,    a  brownish  black   pigment     present<br>
    in    'skin   and   hair.    The   mechanism  by   which   this   transformation      is<br>
       hydroxylation'	<br>
accompl ished      i s   not   known.    Accordi ng   to   Raper,    a   <br>
of   benzene   nucleus   possibly   takes   place,    followed   by   ring   closure whereby   indole   derivatives   are   formed.<br>
para- ami nobenzoic   acid   modifies   the   for mation   of   melanin.     In      the<br><br>
Tyrosi ne-tyrosi nase  reaction, a typical red stage 1  is  reached<br>
before the black preclpitate of melani n is obtained. In the presence of the acid, the red stage is not seen and in the place of the black mel ani n precipi tate, a browni sh product i s obtai ned. It has also been claimed that mel anophore hormone of the pi tui tary accelerates the tyrosine-tyrosi nase reaction. There are di fferent  degrees  and forms of the di sease and the  cure mai nly<br><br>
i<br>
 1<br><br>
depends  on  the  extent of manifestation. This  is  due  to  the shortage or complete absence of tyrosinase In the system. Several ayurvedic  preparations are known to be prescribed  for  vitiiigo such  as  a composi tion comprisl ng Psora! ia  Coryf ol i a,  common! y known  as  buchki dana  and Pavoni a  Odorata,  common! y  known  as udi cha.  Another commonly prescribed compost ti on i s a mi xture  of Pl umbago  Rosea  Linn. ( Raktachita) and  Mussaenda  frondosa  Lin (Nagbal11). However, presentl y no cure is known for the  disease, particul arl y in its advanced stages. OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It  is  therefore  an  object of  this  invention  to  propose  a pharmaceutical preparation for the treatment of 1 eucoderma. It is a further object of this invention to propose a  pharmaceutical preparation for the treatment of leucoderma which is  cheap and can be made easily avail able.<br>
Another  object of this Invention is to propose a  pharmaceutical preparation  for the treatment of 1 eucoderma which  is  efficient even for advanced stages of the di sease. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordi ng to this invention, there is provided a pharmaceuti ca! preparation for the treatment of leucoderma comprising tyrosine, a dil uent and optional ly methionine and an inorganic salt of zi nc.<br>
According to this invention, there is further provided a  process for  the  preparati on  of a pharmaceuti cal  composition  for  the<br>
2<br><br>
treatment of &amp; process for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for the treatment of leucoderma comprising mixing tyrostne with a diluent and optionally conventional additives such as herein described to obtain a first mixture, preparing a second mixture of methionine and the diluent and adding the second mixture to the first mixture, before adding the zinc salt thereto.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparation is in the form of an oral formulation or a topical formulation.<br>
The topical formulation comprises tyrostne and a diluent in a carrier such as water.<br>
About 1 to 3 gms of the mixture of tyrostne and the diluent is dissolved in about 45 to 135 ml distilled water and 5 to 15 ml of a preservative such as 90% rectified spirit Is added to It to obtain the topical formulation.<br>
The oral formulation comprises tyrosine, methlonlne, diluent and an Inorganic salt of zinc<br>
In accordance with this invention, the oral formulation is prepared by thoroughly mixing tyrosine with a diluent and slowly Increasing the proportion of the diluent to obtain a mixture of tyrosine and the dfluent. Thereafter, methlonlne Is mixed with the diluent and the dilution is slowly increased by increasing the proportion of sugar to obtain a mixture of methionine and the diluent. The two mixtures are then mixed thoroughly and zinc sulphate Is added to It, followed by a further mixing.<br>
Thereafter, optional additives are added to the mixture obtained to obtain the oral formulation.<br>
3<br><br>
About 5 to 9 gms of the mixture of tyrosine and the diluent Is mixed with 1 to 5 gms of methfonfne mixture and about 1 gm of (he Inorganic salt of zinc Is mixed together to obtain the oral formulation. Ths inorganic saft of zinc Is any salt of zinc, preferably a sulphate.<br>
The diluent used Is a sugar such as lactose, fructose, sucrose, glucose, etc., preferably lactose.<br>
The binder Is a compound such as carboxymethyl cellulose; the disintegrate used is starch; the glidant used is such as aerosil; magnesium stearate. The lubricant used Is a compound such as talcum powder and the preservative Is a p-hydroxybenzoate compound such as methyl paraben (methyl p-hydroxybenzoate), propyl paraben (propyl p-hydroxybenzoate) etc.<br>
The carrier used for the topical formulation Is a solvent such as water.<br>
The Invention win now be explained In greater detail with the help of the following norvllmftlng examples.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
About 1 gm of tyroslne Is thoroughly mixed with about 9 gms of lactose (80-100 mesh) placed in a mortar and the mixture is macerated for 60 mins. Every 6 mins. of maceration is followed by mixing for 1 min. This process is repeated 10 times. The mixture Is transferred in a bigger mortar and fresh lactose of 90 gms is mixed with it for about 10 mins. It is again macerated<br>
4<br><br>
for 5 mi ns. and mixed for a minute. This process is repeated 1Ø times. Fresh lactose, 9ØØ  gms is taken In a big mortar and the mi xture obtained earlier is poured over it, foil owed by thorough mixing for about 10 mins. . This is again followed by maceration for 5 mins. and mixing for a min. , 10 ti mes to obtain the tyrosine mixture of 1000 dilution.<br>
In  a similar way, about 300 mg of methionine is mixed  with  2.7 gms of 1actose for about 5 mins. . This is fol 1 owed by  maceration for 5 mi ns. and mi xi ng for a mi n. , 10 times to obtai'n a  mi xture. In another mortar, about 27 gms lactose Is taken and the  mixture i s  poured  over i t and mi xed thoroughly.  It i s macerated  for  5 mins.  and mi xed for a mi n. , 10 tl mes to obtain a mi xture,  which is  agal n  mi xed  wi th about 270 gms of 1 actose.  This  is  agai n followed  by  maceration for 5 mins. and mixing for  1  mi n. ,  10 ti mes to obtai n the methionine mi xture of 1000 di 1 ution. TOPICAL FORMULATION<br>
About 2 gms of the tyrosi ne mixture is dissolved in about 90 ml distil 1 ed  water and to this sol uti on, about 10 ml 90%  recti f i ed spirit  is added and the mixture is shaken to obtain the  topical formul ation. ORAL FORMULATION<br>
About 7 gms of tyrosi ne mi xture and 3 gms of methi on!ne are mixed thoroughly for about 20 mins. and 100 mgs or 0.1 gms zinc sut phate, pul verised to a very fine mesh size added to the mixture with thorough mixing.<br>
5<br><br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
For  the  preparation  of cap lets? tyrosine  and  methionine  are diluted separately with lactose (80-100mesh) as per  homoeopathic method  of  dilution  to 1000 times. Both the  diluted  forms  of tyrosine  and  methionine  are  we 31  mixed.  Zinc  sulphate   is pulverised  to  very fine mesh. Powder obtained, le.  mixture  of tyrosine  +  methionine  are mixed  geometrically  with  zinc sulphate  powder.  So all the three active ingredients  are  well mixed with lactose. This mixed powder is the starting for  tablet (cap let) manufacture. FOR THE PRODUCTION OF 5 Ø , Ø Ø Ø  CAPLET<br>
1. Tyrosine 0.7 mg x 1 Ø Ø Ø  = 0.7 g x 50,000     35 kgs.<br>
2. Methionine 0.3 mg x 1000 = 0.3 g x 50,000  15 fcgs.<br>
