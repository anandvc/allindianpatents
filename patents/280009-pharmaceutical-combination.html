3.PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION:<br>
The following specification describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br>
 <br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical combination is useful for the treatment of metabolic syndrome. The invention also relates to a method for the treatment of said metabolic disorders/diseases, comprising simultaneous, separate or sequential administration of effective amounts of specific active compounds and/or co-treatment, in a ratio which provides an additive and synergistic effect, and to the combined use of these specific compounds for the manufacture of corresponding pharmaceutical combination preparations. The present invention relates more specifically to a pharmaceutical combination comprising Hydroxychloroquine and a DPP-IV inhibitor or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, for the treatment of Type-2 diabetes mellitus.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
According to the American Heart Association, about 60% of male and nearly 50% of female are overweight, in which approximately 18% are relatively obese. Obesity can lead to metabolic syndrome, apart from other factors, which is characterized by a group of metabolic risk factors in one person. They include: (a) central obesity, indicated by excessive fat tissue in and around the abdomen; (b) dyslipidemia (blood fat disorders, mainly high triglycerides and low HDL cholesterol, that foster plaque buildups in artery walls); (c) elevated blood pressure; (d) insulin resistance or glucose intolerance (the body can't properly use insulin or blood sugar); (e) prothrombotic state (e.g., high fibrinogen or plasminogen activator inhibitor in the blood); and (f) pro-inflammatory conditions. The underlying causes of metabolic disorders/syndrome may include overweight/obesity, physical inactivity and genetic factors. People with metabolic syndrome are at increased risk of coronary heart disease, other diseases related to plaque buildup in artery walls (e.g., stroke and peripheral vascular disease) and Type 2 diabetes. According to the American Diabetes Association, 20.6% of adults over the age of 60 have diabetes and 34.8% of all adults have either diabetes or pre-diabetes. Metabolic syndrome has become increasingly common in the western world. The syndrome is closely associated with a generalized metabolic disorder called insulin resistance, in which the body cannot use insulin efficiently. Metabolic syndrome is also called insulin resistance syndrome, which leads to Type 2 diabetes.<br>
 <br>
Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (type 2 diabetes mellitus) is characterized by both increased peripheral insulin resistance and abnormal insulin secretion. At least three abnormalities of insulin secretion are recognized: in the first phase, insulin secretion is lost and in the second phase insulin is both delayed and inadequate in the face of elevated circulating glucose levels. Several metabolic, hormonal, and pharmacological entities are known to stimulate insulin secretion including glucose, amino-_acids and gastrointestinal peptides. The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) has established that lowering of blood glucose is associated with decreases in the onset and progression of diabetic   microvascular   complications   (Diabetes   Control   and   Complications   Trial Research Group; N. Engl. J. Med. 1993, 329, 977-986). Impaired Glucose Tolerance is an impairment of glucose homeostasis closely related to type 2 diabetes mellitus. Both conditions convey a great risk of macrovascular disease. Therefore, one therapeutic focus is on optimizing and potentially normalizing glycemic control in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, conditions of impaired fasting plasma glucose, or IGT. Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-Iike peptide (GLP-1) are the 2 major incretin hormones released after meals to enhance glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and control the increase in glucose levels. In patients with type 2 diabetes, a loss of activity of GIP for insulinotropic function and a reduced secretion of GLP-1 exist in response to oral glucose while GLP-1 action is preserved. GLP-1 is therefore an attractive avenue for treating type 2 diabetes. GLP-1 is degraded by dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV). Dipeptidyl Peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) inhibiting agents are of particular pharmacological significance, and represent a novel class of oral antihyperglycemic agents for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Specific DPP-4 inhibitors either already approved for marketing or under clinical development for the treatment of Type   2   diabetes   include   sitagliptin,   vildagliptin,   saxagliptin,   melogliptin,   P93/01 (Prosidion), alogliptin, denagliptin, Roche 0730699, TS021 (Taisho), and E3024 (Eisai), linagliptin, carmegliptin, gosogliptin, teneligliptin and dutogliptin. For example, oral administration of sitagliptin, vildagliptin, alogliptin, and saxagliptin to human Type 2 diabetics has been found to reduce fasting glucose and postprandial glucose excursion in association with significantly reduced HbAlc levels. The therapeutic utility of these antihyperglycemic agents rest on their ability to increase active (intact) levels of incretin peptides,    including    glucagon-like    peptide-1     (GLP-1)    and    glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP).<br>
 <br>
Hydroxychloroquine, a commonly used antirheumatic medication, has hypoglycemic effect and may reduce the risk of diabetes. The previous studies in diabetic rats show that hydroxychloroquine significantly elevates insulin blood concentration resulting in reduced blood glucose. It is also reported to inhibit insulin metabolism by inhibiting cytosolic insulin metabolizing enzyme. Clinically, hydroxychloroquine showed improvement in sulphonylurea refractory patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. Along with anti-hyperglycemic effects, hydroxychloroquine is also associated with cardiovascular benefits. Clinical studies show that changes in lipids with hydroxychloroquine may lead to a significant reduction in IHD risk. However, in more than 10% of patients glycaemic control with monotherapy cannot be maintained. Since the disease itself is progressive and the therapeutic attempts to achieve and maintain glycemic control often fail in the long run, type 2 diabetic patients are required to be treated with a combination of therapies/drugs. Metabolic disorders lead to a cascade of aforementioned diseases and it is always advantageous if oral treatment for diabetes mellitus would be a treatment that not only controls the glycemic level, but also prevents the development of atherosclerosis and other complications associated with metabolic disorders.<br>
The object of the present invention is to develop a pharmaceutical drug products for the treatment of metabolic disorders, and which products ameliorate at least one symptom of the condition/disease or improves the condition thereof, if not all, in the treatment of diseases arising out of metabolic syndrome, especially diabetes mellitus.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Accordingly, in one aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical combination for treating metabolic disorders, especially diabetes mellitus. The combination is also useful for achieving weight loss and weight control by preventing much of the calories of a carbohydrate-containing food from having an impact. Consumption of the combination of active drugs according to the invention affects the metabolic pathways of carbohydrate metabolism, resulting in less glucose getting into the body and more glucose in the bloodstream getting shunted to the muscles. Consumption of the combination according to the present invention by a subject promotes an increase in the ratio between lean and adipose tissue in the subject.<br>
 <br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides a method of treating diabetes and associated metabolic disorders comprising administration of Hydroxychloroquine and a DPP-IV inhibitor or their pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The method comprises simultaneous, separate or sequential administration of effective amounts of the above active compounds and/or co-treatment, in a ratio which provides an additive and synergistic effect.<br>
The present invention provides a novel composition(s) or kit comprising of hydroxychloroquine or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts and DPP-IV inhibitors for simultaneous, separate, sequential, including in alternation, or combined use, especially in the prevention, delay of progression or treatment of conditions mediated by dipeptidylpeptidase - IV (DPP-IV), in particular diabetes, more particularly, type 2 diabetes mellitus, conditions of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), conditions of impaired fasting plasma glucose, metabolic acidosis, ketosis, arthritis, obesity and osteoporosis, Specific DPP-4 inhibitors according to the invention are selected from, but not limited to, sitagliptin, vildagliptin, saxagliptin, melogliptin, P93/01 (Prosidion), alogliptin, denagliptin, Roche 0730699, TS021 (Taisho), E3024 (Eisai), linagliptin, carmegliptin, gosogliptin, teneligliptin and dutogliptin and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br>

effective amounts of the above active compounds and/or co-treatment with other medications, in a ratio which provides an additive and synergistic effect.<br>
The treatment aims diseases arising out of metabolic disorders, for example, those of (a) central obesity, indicated by excessive fat tissue in and around the abdomen; (b) dyslipidemia (blood fat disorders, mainly high triglycerides and low HDL cholesterol, that foster plaque buildups in artery walls); (c) elevated blood pressure; (d) insulin resistance or glucose intolerance (the body can't properly use insulin or blood sugar); (e) prothrombotic state (e.g., high fibrinogen or plasminogen activator inhibitor in the blood); (f) pro-inflammatory conditions such as osteoarthritis ; and/or a combinations of one or more of the afore-mentioned diseases.<br>
The method of treatment primarily useful for the control of blood glucose/sugar levels especially in Type 2 diabetes mellitus, apart from reduction of other bio-chemical parameters such as, HbAlc, and serum triglycerides.The combination not only reduces the level of bad cholesterol (LDL), but also increases the levels of good cholesterol (HDL).<br>
Specific DPP-4 inhibitors according to the invention are selected from, but not limited to, sitagliptin, vildagliptin, saxagliptin, melogliptin, P93/01 (Prosidion), alogliptin, denagliptin, Roche 0730699, TS021 (Taisho), E3024 (Eisai), linagliptin, carmegliptin, gosogliptin, teneligliptin and dutogliptin and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. One preferred DPP-4 inhibitor according to the invention is sitagliptin.<br>
Accordingly, the preferred embodiment of the invention provides a pharmaceutical combination comprising hydroxychloroquine and sitagliptin or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, or a prodrug thereof.<br>
The quantity of each substance to be administered will vary depending upon the DPP-IV inhibitor used, subject to be treated severity of disease or condition being treated, body weight and age of the subject, the manner of administration and the like, which can readily be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art. The method for oral administration may comprise hydroxychloroquine, or its pharmaceutical salt for an average adult, in a quantity range from 50 mg to 500 mg calculated based on the weight<br>
 <br>
of hydroxychloroquine free base, more preferably a dose of 150 to 400 mg may be administered as a daily dose. The DPP-IV inhibitor, for example, Sitagliptin, as phosphate monohydrate salt for an average adult patient may be used in range of 5 to 100 mg per day, more preferably in an amount of 10 mg 50 mg.<br>
Accordingly, a daily dosage of 100 mg to 500 mg of hydroxychloroquine free base and 3.5 mg to 80 mg of sitagliptin free base, or the corresponding dosage of the respective salt, solvate, or a prodrug thereof, may be conveniently administered to a patient in need thereof.<br>
The pharmaceutical combination according to the present invention, wherein sitagliptin is fixed in a range from 3.5 mg to 80 mg calculated based on the weight of sitagliptin free base.<br>
The pharmaceutical combination according to the present invention, wherein, sitagliptin is more preferably fixed in a range from 6 mg to 31 mg calculated based on the weight of sitagliptin free base.<br>
The present combination drugs or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvate or prodrugs thereof can be delivered to the subject using a wide variety of routes or modes of administration. Suitable routes of administration include, but are not limited to, oral, transdermal, transmucosal, intestinal and parenteral administration, including intramuscular, subcutaneous and intravenous injections. A preferred mode of administration includes in oral dosage form.<br>
Typically a fixed dose combination of hydroxychloroquine and DPP-IV inhibitor can be administered once or twice a day for short term or long term treatment to a patient suffering from metabolic syndrome/diseases, especially diabetes Mellitus. Long term treatment refers to an extended period of time, typically longer than two weeks, and includes any length of time whereby the individual/subject (mammal) exhibits improvement in disease conditions/symptoms. This dosage formulation will be beneficial for prophylactic treatment of individuals who are identified to develop metabolic disorders or pre-diabetic symptoms.<br>
 <br>
Prediabetes, also referred as borderline diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and/or impaired fasting glucose (IFG) is the state in which some but not all of the diagnostic criteria for diabetes are met. It is often described as the "gray area" between normal blood sugar and diabetic levels. While in this range, patients are at risk for not only developing type 2 diabetes, but also for cardiovascular complications. In a way, prediabetes is a misnomer since it is an early stage of diabetes and hence is recommended as a parameter to identify those who are at increased risk of developing the disease. The present invention also provides novel composition(s) or kit or co-pack/combi-pack comprising of hydroxychloroquine or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates or prodrugs thereof and DPP-IV inhibitors for simultaneous, separate, sequential, including in alternation, or combined use, especially in the prevention, delay of progression or treatment of conditions mediated by dipeptidylpeptidase - IV (DPP-IV), and metabolic disorders, in particular diabetes, more particularly, type 2 diabetes mellitus, conditions of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), conditions of impaired fasting plasma glucose, metabolic acidosis, ketosis, arthritis, obesity and osteoporosis.<br>
The quantity of hydroxychloroquine or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts and DPP-IV inhibitors in the composition may be fixed in range from 100 mg to 500 mg calculated based on the weight of hydroxychloroquine free base, more preferably a dose of 150 to 400 mg and the DPP-IV inhibitor, for example, Sitagliptin, as phosphate monohydrate salt may be used in range of 5 to 100 mg, more preferably in an amount of 10mg 50 mg, for oral use, respectively.<br>
The composition of hydroxychloroquine along with DPP-IV inhibitors can be manufactured in combination with pharmaceutical carriers or diluents. For oral use, suitable pharmaceutical carriers include inert diluents or fillers thereby forming oral dosage forms such as tablets, powders, capsules, syrups or suspensions and the like.<br>
The fixed dose formulation of the present invention is preferably in the form of tablets or capsules, wherein tablets/capsules can be prepared in immediate release, modified/controlled release, extended or in sustained release form. Dosage form may be, for example, but not limited to, a multilayer tablet, a two-layer tablet, or capsules or<br>
 <br>
sachets containing the active ingredients in separate granulates or beads, either granulate<br>
or bead, optionally being coated with a protective coating or an enteric-coating.<br>
For example, tablets containing variety of excipients such as disintegrants such as starch,<br>
complex silicates together with binding agents such as poly vinyl pyrrolidone, sucrose,<br>
gelatin and acacia. Lubricants such as magnesium silicate/stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate<br>
and talc are often used in tableting purposes. Solid compositions of the present invention<br>
can also be filled into soft and hard gelatin capsules.<br>
For soft gelatin capsule, the composition may be solubilized in suitable vegetable or<br>
edible oil such as sunflower oil, corn oil, peanut oil or any other suitable oil.<br>
The safety, efficacy and additive &amp; synergistic effect of the combination of hydroxychloroquine with a DPP-IV inhibitor in type-2 diabetes is established by the following experiment.<br>
PHARMACOLOGICAL EVALUATION:<br>
In this study we compared the efficacy in terms of potency of hydroxychloroquine with or without the DPP-IV inhibitor for example, Sitagliptin phosphate and the biochemical parameters such as serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, SGOT, SGPT, creatinine and urea levels were monitored &amp; compared with disease induced model &amp; normal control rats.<br>
Study design:<br>
Experimental study on fixed dose combination of hydroxycloroquine with sitagliptin An experimental study was conducted in Institute of Pharmaceutical Research and Education, Wardha, India to demonstrate the efficacy of combination of hydroxychloroquine with sitagliptin in diabetes. In this experiment 48 Wistar rats weighing 130 - 150 g of either sex were divided randomly into 8 groups consisting of 6 rats each. The study drugs suspended in vehicle [0.1 % w/v suspension of Tween 80 and carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) in water] were administered for orally for 21 days. Group 1 (normal vehicle control) consisted of normal rats that neither received streptozotocin nor any test drug; Group 2 served as streptozotocin induced diabetic control (Diabetes was induced in rats by single administration of streptozotocin (60 mg/kg/i.p) dissolved in 0.1 M-citrate buffer, pH 4.5). Forty-eight hours later, blood samples were collected and<br>
 <br>
glucose levels were determined to confirm the development of diabetes. Only those animals which showed hyperglycemia (blood glucose levels&gt;250 mg/d1) were considered as diabetic and received vehicle orally; Group 3 was diabetic rats treated with dose equivalent to human therapeutic dose of sitagliptin (STG) ( 11 mg/kg); Group 4 was diabetic rats treated with dose equivalent to human therapeutic dose of Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) (46 mg/kg), Group 5 was diabetic rats treated with combination of HCQ 46 mg/kg and STG11 mg/kg; Group 6 was diabetic rats treated with subtherapeutic dose of HCQ 23 mg/kg; Group 7 was diabetic rats treated with subtherapeutic dose of STG 5.5 mg/kg and Group 8 was diabetic rats treated with combination of HCQ 23 mg/kg and STG 5.5 mg/kg.<br>
Blood glucose level was measured in normal and experimental rats at 1st, 7th, 14th and 21st day of administration. For other biochemical parameters i.e. Insulin, HbAlc, Triglycerides, Total Cholesterol, HDL, SGOT, SGPT, Total Protein, Albumin, Creatinine and Urea Blood samples were collected lh after the last dose administration from 18 h fasted rats through the retro-orbital plexus under chloroform anesthesia and analyzed using autoanalyzer (Microlab 2000). Other parameters like body weight, food intake and water intake were evaluated weekly till day 21st.<br>
Baseline parameters did not differ significantly between the groups. After inducing diabetes, the serum levels of glucose, HbAlc, total cholesterol, triglycerides, SGOT, SGPT, creatinine and urea levels were high as compared to normal control rats. Oral administration of sitagliptin and hydroxychloroquine alone at therapeutic dose showed significant improvement in blood glucose levels on day 14th while combination of STG and HCQ at therapeutic dose showed highly significant decrease in blood glucose on day 7th as compared to diabetic control. Combination of therapeutic doses of hydroxychloroquine and sitagliptin showed significantly more fall in blood glucose levels as compared to individual treatment groups.<br>
Serum Insulin levels were significantly reduced (p 
 <br>
STG and HCQ for 21 days at therapeutic and subtherapeutic dose showed significant reduction in HblAc level as compared to diabetic control (p
Diabetic control rats showed significant rise in serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, SGOT, SGPT, creatinine and urea levels as compared to normal control rats. There were significant reductions in serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, SGOT, SGPT levels of the diabetic rats treated with combination of sitagliptin and hydroxychloroquine at therapeutic dose and sub-therapeutic dose as compared to the diabetic control group. Creatinine and serum urea level were significantly reduced only by combination treatment at therapeutic dose.<br>
Similarly diabetic control rats showed significant fall in HDL-C, albumin &amp; total protein levels as compared to normal control rats. After treatment for 21 days with therapeutic dose combinations there was significant rise in HDL-C levels as compared to the diabetic control group. While significant rise in albumin and total protein levels was observed in both the groups treated with therapeutic and sub-therapeutic dose combinations as compared to the diabetic control group. A significant reduction in body weight of diabetic animals was observed on day 14 and day 21 when compared with normal rats. Treatment of diabetic animals with combination shown significant increase in the body weight. Average food and water intake in diabetic animals was increased significantly compared to normal animals. Combination treatment groups shown decrease in food and water intake.<br>
