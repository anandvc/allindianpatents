The present application is being filed as addition of Patent to invention disclosed<br>
in Indian Patent Application No 1337/CAL/97 (	) of 16th July, 1997.<br>
According to Patent Application No 1337/CAL/97, there has been disclosed an "IMPROVED RAZOR BLADE ASSEMBLY".<br>
r<br>
The present invention relates to wet shaving implements and is directed more particularly to Razor Blade Assembly which as a whole is movable on handle assembly during shaving operation and consists of individual blade components having a base, formed by fixing a L-shaped metal back-up rib, which is fixed to the blade by insert moulding with engineering grade polymer. The base support is independently movable during shaving operation and the blades follow the contours of the face on their own during shaving process.<br>
In particular the improved cartridge consists of an antifriction strip blades and guard bar assembled together on a body and replaceable on an unit to be fitted to a suitable razor handle. It is already provided in various Patents that in a blade assembly, in which various blades arc fitted to an assembly, move on the shaving surface and also it is known that this assembly is adopted to take the contours of the shaving surface during the process of shaving.<br>
It is known in the art to provide a razor blade assembly winch may be connected to, and used in conjunction with a razor handle to facilitate shaving operation. U S. Patent No.3,724,070 shows a blade assembly in which blade means are held between blade assembly surfaces adapted to engage the surface being shaved in front of and behind, respectively, cutting edge portions of the blade means. Such surfaces arc generally referred to a "guard" and "cap"<br><br>
-3-<br>
It is known that the shaving efficiency of safety razor assembly is improved if the blade assembly is adopted to pivot on the razot handle during a shaving operation, permitting the blade assembly to follow the contours of a surface being shaved more closely For improved shaving pivotally movable razor handle assembly can take the surface of the skin contour to be shaved in response to forces encounter during shaving apart from fixed type razor blade assembly The above facilities illustrated in U S Patent Nos 3,935,639, 3;939,247, 3,724,070, 3,950,849, 4,026,016, 4,083,104 to get more shaving efficiency independently Movable blades giving better response to force encounter during shaving<br>
Another means by which increased shaving efficiency may be obtained in that of retaining the blade assembly, as a whole, stationary but permitting movement of individual components thereof in response to forces encountered during shaving In U.S Patent No 4,168,571 there is shown a blade assembly in which the guard, cap and blade means are each moveable independently of each other in dynamic fashion Indian Patent No- 155035 in which it has been shown a blade assembly in which the guard element and blade means are independently moveable In Indian Patent/Specification No 160909, there is shown a blade assembly in which the blade means, guard element is independently moveable and the blade assembly as a whole moves pivotally on a suitable razor assembly<br>
U S Patent No 4,492,024 there is disclosed a safety razor blade assembly adapted for pivotal movement, as a whole on a razor handle during a shaving operation, and having blade means moveable within the blade assembly in response to forces encountered shaving operation<br>
It is now observed that in all the conventional cartridges mentioned above, single blade or plurality of blades are fixed rigidly to the body of the cartridge without any flexible support provided in between the blades and therefore the effectiveness and flexibility of those kind of blades arc greatly reduced Moreover, in the absence of proper support the single blade or multiple blades fail to take the shave of the shaveable surface of the face in response to forces applied during the shaving process<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
Moreover, it has been mentioned in previous Patents in the art that the base of the blade is made of engineering grade polymer But while manufacturing the cartridge as per prior art it has been observed that there is a tendency for bending of the blades while the base is formed by insert moulding This is because of dissimilar properties, particularly in terms of coefficient of expansion and contraction of metal and polymer The shrinkage factor of polymer is much higher (approximately 0 02 mm/cm) as compared to steel, which has a coefficient of expansion in much lower range For this reason it is found that a slight curvature results in the blades after being moulded by polymer and which results in discomfort during shaving On measurement it has been observed that the blade gets distorted within the maximum and minimum limits of 0 12 mm and 0 05 mm respectively<br>
According to an object of the present invention is to provide an improved shaving blades cartridge which is normal in its constructional design and obviates all disadvantages and drawbacks associated with conventional shaving blade cartridges existing in the art<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide an improved shaving blade cartridge which is simple but rigid in its construction, easy to operate, effective in its use and having over all flexibility in operation<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an improved shaving blade cartridge having a base formed by fixing L-shaped metal back up rib such that the top portion of the rib and back portion of the blade are wrapped together by insert moulding with engineering grade polymer Independently moveable "L" shape blade assembly having we components 16 and 18 which is shown in Fig 3 and it fixing by moulding process with engineering grade polymer<br>
A still object of the present invention is to provide an improved razor blade assembly wherein both the back portion of the blade and the top portion of the rib have got matching perforations so that the said portions arc wrapped together by insert moulding with engineering grade polymer For proper fixing the blade 16 with "L" shaped metal back up nb 18 there is so many matching perforation in both components for wrapped to gathet by moulding process with engineering grade polymer<br><br>
-5-<br>
Another object is "L" shaped metal back up ob 18, which is 'shown in Fig.3, gives better rigidity as well as comfort during shaving Alongwith that another object of present invention is integrated guard bar gives better control of shaving geometry i. e., protrusion and shaving angle According to an object of the present invention is to provide an improved Razor Blade Assembly where the base of the blade is thicker than the actual thickness of the blades, thereby achieving greater rigidity, as well as flexibility and comfort during shaving Yet another object of the present invention is to provide improved shaving blade cartridge, provided with an integrated guard bat to control the protrusion and shaving angle, more closely, thereby enabling better and comfortable shave<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide an improved shaving blade cartridge comprising of body member having top, middle and bottom blades, supported by metal back up ribs, partially wrapped with engineering grade polymer base which enable the blade to be independently resilient in relation to forces encountered during shaving and follows the contours of the shaving surface and at the same time maintaining a close control on the protrusion and shaving angle of the blades with with respect to "guard bar" and "cap" to give a comfortable shave<br>
A still another object of the present invention is to provide an improved razor blade assembly where the metal base is partially wrapped with engineering grade polymer on the top portion keeping the bottom vertical portion exposed thereby providing optimum rigidity and flexibility to the blades after being assembled<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an improved shaving blade cartridge, which ts elegant in its appearance, cheaper in original costs, stronger in its construction and light in weight<br>
Keeping the above objects in mind, according to the present "invention there is provided an improved Razor Blade Assembly comprising an antifriction stop, a plurality of blades supported by metal base charactenzed in that the top portion of said metal base being moulded with the blade by insert moulding of engineering grade polymer through matching<br><br>
