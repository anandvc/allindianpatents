This invention relates to a hand-held labelling or printing device with a belt or wheel printing nechaniam and with a stepping device for serial (TRANSLATOR'S ALTERNATIVE SUGGESTION: continuous) numbering, whereby the stepping device has a pivotably mounted stepping lever, actuatable by an actuator handle on the unit.<br>
Known devices include many different types of embodiments, and a large number of such devices are in use. They are used primarily in supermarkets or other stores, in which preferably packaged merchandise must be provided with a label, or another sort of printed information medium.  The labelling devices are used to print labels, or sometimes to print information directly on the merchandise packages.  The devices are required to make both unchanging impressions, e.g. the selling price on one group of merchandise, and, can also be required to print serial numbers, for example. A line of print accordingly consists of a finite number of printed symbols, each of which is located on a printing wheel, or on a printing belt. To keep the printing wheels to a reasonable size, the capacity of the wheels is limited.  On the other hand, a printing belt can have several times more symbols than a printing wheel, e.g. two or three times the number of symbols, for which reason units with a belt printing mechanism, with the same maximum number of symbols per row of the printing mechanism, can be used in more applications than a corresponding wheel printing mechanism.<br>

Summary<br>
A hand-held laballing or printing mechanism with a belt or wheel printing mechanism (4) has a stationary handle (8) and a hand lever (7) mounted so that it can pivot. By means of this hand lever, the printing mechanism is pivoted toward the label which is located in the printing area, which label is then printed.<br>
The housing of the printing mechanism projects beyond the housing (2) of the labelling unit.  To properly utilize the space inside the housing [2),  only the gear wheels (20) which act as pulleys for the printing belts (23) are located inside the area of the printing mechanism housing (12) that is located inside the unit housing (2). The invention teaches that additional devices which must be located in a wider portion of the printing mechanism housing (4) are located in the vicinity of the gear wheels (22) which are distant from the printing area.  Consequently, the gear wheals or pulley wheels which are closer to the printing area can be kept relatively small, which also helps to reduce the size of the housing in this area.<br>

into a oosnb-like structure/ which is riveted by means of rivets 44 to a shoulder of the depression 41b.  Bach detent element 42 is engaged in one of the latch locators 39 of the corresponding gear wheel. Because the detent elements 42 are arranged abreast (TRANSLATOR'S ALTERNATIVE SUGGESTION: in alignment), the result is an orientation of all the teeth of all the gear wheels, also abreast (TRANSLATOR'S ALTERNATIVE SUGGESTION: in alignment).  In this manner, a precise orientation of all the symbols of the printing belts 23 is also achieved.  Figure 9 also shows an external collar 45, the two ends of which forms stops 46 and 47 for the wheel 33, which wheel 33 has teeth over only a portion of its circumference, is non-rotationally connected to the drive shaft of the stepping device, and is in particular molded integrally to the drive shaft and is made of plastic.<br>
Inserted on the hollow shaft 24 fastened to the housing, on the free end facing the housing wall 19, there is a control device 48, by means of which the number of pivoting movements of the stepping lever 28 can be specified, which causes an indexing movement of the belt or belts 23.  Depending on the setting of this control device, the units-wheel can be made to advance by one step, e.g. after each pivoting movement of the stepping lever 28, or only after each second pivoting movement of the lever.<br>
As shown in Figure 10, the essential elements of this control device 48 are a ring-shaped notched disc 49 which is rotationally mounted on the hollow shaft 24 fastened to the housing, and a control ring 50 which is rotationally fastened to the notched disc 49 so that the control ring 50 can be actuated in angular (TRANSLATOR'S ALTERNATIVE SUGGESTION:  rotational) stages.  On the inside circumference of the control ring 50, there are index notches 51. For the tens counter, there are ten index notches 51. A control device latch 52 can be inserted in the index notches 51 as desired.  In the illustrated embodiment, this control device latch 52 is designed the same  as the latches 38 and is immediately next to the bearing lug 36a (Figure 4). This latch 52 is also spring-loaded. On the outside circumference of<br>
