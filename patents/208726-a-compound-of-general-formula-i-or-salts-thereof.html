The invention thus also provides a method of combating fungi at a locus infested or liable to be infested therewith, which comprises applying to the locus a compound of formula I.<br>
The invention also provides an agricultural composition comprising a compound of formula I in admixture with an agriculturally acceptable diluent or carrier.<br>
The composition of the invention may of course include more than one compound of the invention.<br>
In addition, the composition can comprise one or more additional active ingredients, for example compounds known to possess plant-growth regulant, herbicidal, fungicidal, insecticidal, acaricidal, antimicrobial or antibacterial properties. Alternatively the compound of the invention can be used in sequence with the other active ingredient.<br>
The diluent or carrier in the composition of the invention can be a solid or a liquid optionally in association with a surface-active agent, for example a dispersing agent, emulsifying agent or wetting agent. Suitable surface-active agents include anionic compounds such as a carboxylate, for example a metal carboxylate of a long chain fatty acid; an N-acylsarcosinate; mono- or di-esters of phosphoric acid with fatty alcohol ethoxylates or alkyl phenol ethoxylates or salts of such esters; fatty alcohol sulfates such as sodium dodecyl sulfate, sodium octadecyl sulfate or sodium cetyl sulfate; ethoxylated fatty<br><br>
alcohol sulfates: ethoxylated alkylphenol sulfates; lignin sulfonates; petroleum sulfonates; alkyl-aryl sulfonates such as alkyl-benzene sulfonates or lower alkylnaphthalene sulfonates, e.g. butyl-naphthalene sulfonate; salts of sulfonated naphthalene-formaldehyde condensates; salts of sulfonated phenol-formaldehyde condensates; or more complex sulfonates such as the amide sulfonates, e.g. the sulfonated condensation product of oleic acid and TV-methyl taurine; the dialkyl sulfosuccinates, e.g. the sodium sulfonate of dioctyl succinate; acid derivatives of alkyl glycosides and alkylpolyglycosides materials and their metal salts, e.g. alkyl polyglycoside citrate or tartrate materials; or mono-, di- and tri-alkyl esters of citric acid and their metal salts.<br>
Nonionic agents include condensation products of fatty acid esters, fatty alcohols, fatty acid amides or fatty-alkyl- or aikenyl-substituted phenols with ethylene and/or propylene oxide; fatty esters of polyhydric alcohol ethers, e.g. sorbitan fatty acid esters: condensation products of such esters with ethylene oxide, e.g. polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters; alkyl glycosides, alkyl polyglycoside materials; block copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide; acetylenic glycols such as 2,4,7,9-tetramethyl-5-decyne-4,7-diol, ethoxylated acetylenic glycols; acrylic based graft copolymers; alkoxylated siloxane surfactants; or imidazoline type surfactants, e.g. l-hydroxyethyl-2-alkylimidazoline.<br>
Examples of a cationic surface-active agent include, for instance, an aliphatic mono-, di-, or polyamine as an acetate, naphthenate or oleate; an oxygen-containing amine such as an amine oxide, polyoxyethylene alkylamine or polyoxypropylene alkylamine: an amide-linked amine prepared by the condensation of a carboxylic acid with a di- or polyamine; or a quaternary ammonium salt.<br>
The compositions of the invention can take any form known in the art for the formulation of agrochemicals, for example, a solution, an aerosol, a dispersion, an aqueous emulsion, a microemulsion, a dispersible concentrate, a dusting powder, a seed dressing, a fumigant, a smoke, a dispersible powder, an emulsifiable concentrate, granules or an impregnated strip. Moreover it can be in a suitable form for direct application or as a concentrate or primary composition which requires dilution with a suitable quantity of water or other diluent before application.<br><br>
A dispersible concentrate comprises a compound of the invention dissolved in one or more water miscible or semi-water miscible solvents together with one or more surface activeand/or polymeric material. Addition of the formulation to water results in the crystalisation of the active ingredient, the process being controlled by the surfactants and/or polymers resulting in a fine dispersion.<br>
A dusting powder comprises a compound of the invention intimately mixed and ground with a solid pulverulent diluent, for example, kaolin.<br>
An emulsifiable concentrate comprises a compound of the invention dissolved in a water-immiscible solvent which forms an emulsion or microemulsion on addition to water in the presence of an emulsifying agent.<br>
A granular solid comprises a compound of the invention associated with similar diluents to those that may be employed in dusting powders, but the mixture is granulated by known methods. Alternatively it comprises the active ingredient absorbed or coated on a pre-formed granular carrier, for example, Fuller's earth, attapulgite, silica or limestone grit.<br>
Wettable powders, granules or grains usually comprise the active ingredient in admixture with suitable surfactants and an inert powder diluent such as clay or diatomaceous earth.<br>
Another suitable concentrate is a flowable suspension concentrate which is formed by grinding the compound with water or other liquid, surfactants and a suspending agent.<br>
The concentration of the active ingredient in the composition of the present invention, as applied to plants is preferably within the range of 0.0001 to 1.0 per cent by weight, especially 0.0001 to 0.01 per cent by weight. In a primary composition, the amount of active ingredient can vary widely and can be, for example, from 5 to 95 per cent by weight of the composition.<br>
The invention is generally applied to seeds, plants or their habitat. Thus, the compound can be applied directly to the soil before, at or after drilling so that the presence of active compound in the soil can control the growth of fungi which may attack seeds. When the soil is treated directly the active compound can be applied in any manner which allows it to<br><br>
be intimately mixed with the soil such as by spraying, by broadcasting a solid form of granules, or by applying the active ingredient at the same time as drilling by inserting it in the same drill as the seeds. A suitable application rate is within the range of from 5 to 1000 g per hectare, more preferably from 10 to 500 g per hectare.<br>
Alternatively the active compound can be applied directly to the plant by, for example, spraying or dusting either at the time when the fungus has begun to appear on the plant or before the appearance of fungus as a protective measure. In both such cases the preferred mode of application is by foliar spraying. It is generally important to obtain good control of fungi in the early stages of plant growth, as this is the time when the plant can be most severely damaged. The spray or dust can conveniently contain a pre- or post-emergence herbicide if this is thought necessary. Sometimes, it is practicable to treat the roots, bulbs, tubers or other vegetative propaguie of a plant before or during planting, for example, by dipping the roots in a suitable liquid or solid composition. When the active compound is applied directly to the plant a suitable rate of application is from 0.025 to 5 kg per hectare, preferably from 0.05 to 1 kg per hectare.<br>
In addition, the compounds of the invention can be applied to harvested fruits, vegetables or seeds to prevent infection during storage.<br>
In addition, the compounds of the invention can be applied to plants or parts thereof which have been genetically modified to exhibit a trait such as fungal and/or herbicidal resistance.<br>
In addition the compounds of the invention can be used to treat fungal infestations in timber and in public health applications. Also the compounds of the invention can be used to treat insect and fungus infestations in domestic and farm animals.<br>
Compounds of the invention may be prepared, in known manner, in a variety of ways.<br>

Collections of compounds of formula I may also be prepared in a parallel manner, either manually, automatically or semi-automatically. This parallel preparation may be applied to the reaction procedure, work-up or purification of products or intermediates. For a review of such procedures see by S.H. DeWitt in "Annual Reports in Combinatorial Chemistry and Molecular Diversity: Automated synthesis", Volume 1, Verlag Escom 1997, pages 69 to 77.<br>
Furthermore, compounds of the formula I may be prepared using solid-supported methods, where the reactants are bound to a synthetic resin. See for example: Barry A. Bunin in "The<br><br><br>
Combinatorial Index", Academic Press, 1998 and "The tea-bag method" (Houghten, US 4,631,211; Houghten etal., Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci, 1985, 82, 5131-5135).<br>
