				<td>A SYSTEM FOR INSPECTING AND/OR SEGREGATING BANJO BOLTS<br>
AND A PROCESS THERREOF<br>
Field of invention<br>
The present invention relates to the method for eliminating missing of (i) radial holes (ii) axial hole in a banjo bolt and a system to perform the method. The system is a combination of high intensity diffusive type sensors and a rotary encoder. This can be further developed for checking the presence/absence of a hole on a cylindrical member. Also it can be used on any manufacturing device where light sensor/rotary encoder co-relation exists.<br>
Background and priori art<br>
Basically holes are drilled in Banjo bolts by using bench drilling machine manually. Due to this following problems are encountered.<br>
1.	Blank without holes mixes with good products.<br>
2.	Missing operation i.e. missing of axial / radial holes again mixes with good products<br>
3.	Broken drills or burrs inside drilled holes and drilled holes will be partially blocked.<br>
4.	Partial hole depth<br>
Also there were lots of mix up problems in plating and before packing.<br>
Banjo bolts are used in lubrication of engines. The mixing of aforesaid bad products with good products results in cease of engine and thereby customer complaints.<br>
The operation sequence of drilling is as follows:<br>
•	A suitable fixture to hold the component for axial hole drilling.<br>
•	Axial hole drilling<br>
•	A suitable fixture to hold the component for radial hole drilling.<br>
•	Radial hole drilling<br>
•	Deburring operation<br><br>
 Today the auto manufacturers are introducing automated assembly lines. Parts are directly fed into the assembly line without any incoming inspection and human involvement. Hence parts have to be defect free and have consistent quality. Any mixing of defective parts i.e. without hole (blanks), with partially completed operations entering into the automated assembly line may cause stoppage and severe damage of assembly line. Customers insist on defect free supplies that can be directly fed to assembly line without any incoming inspection also, maintaining just in time inventory, no scope for rejection and segregation. This necessitates a final quality check by sorting of banjo bolt before despatch to provide the guarantee of 100% defect free supply as expected by the customer.<br>
Objects of invention<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a banjo bolt inspection system which is capable of eliminating banjo bolts having no hole, missing or partially completed holes or of holes filled with broken drill bit etc. and hence avoid mixing of bad products in accepted ones.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for scanning the hole through out 360° of the rotation of the fixture with respect to an encoder. This will eliminate parts with broken drilling bits trapped inside the hole.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to inspect the banjo bolts and determine the hole tolerance so that banjo bolts having under size/over size holes can be eliminated.<br>
Summary of invention<br>
The present invention relates to a banjo bolt inspection system which is capable of eliminating banjo bolts with missing holes, undersize/oversize holes, holes having broken drill bit trapped inside them. The system is a combination of rotating encoder and photo electric sensors. This system has been developed for checking presence /absence of hole in a banjo bolt and can be extended on any manufacturing device where rotating encoder/photo electric or laser sensor co-relation exists.<br>
Particularly, the present invention provides an off line inspection system for monitoring banjo bolts mounted   on a   rotating spindle by scanning the banjo bolt using a photo<br><br>
electric light beam/ laser so that 100% okay products are obtained   prior to dispatch.<br>

Brief description of the accompanying drawings:<br>
Fig.l shows flow diagram of the inspection system-setting cycle.<br>
Fig.2 shows flow diagram for continuous running.<br>
Fig. 3 shows the total system.<br>
Fig.4 shows the concept of hole inspection.<br>
Fig. 5 shows the schematic diagram of the complete system.<br>
Fig.6 shows the equipment of banjo bolt inspection system.<br>
The working of the Banjo inspection system is as follows:<br>
i)	Place the component into the fixture with A/F driving and press the cycle start<br>
Button ii)        CPU sends signal to the drive and spindle rotation starts at 30 rpm (max.) iii)      After first scanning of the hole , PLC will wait for next hole signal from the<br>
machine, then spindle rotation stops iv)       Unloading gripper grips the component, lift up and rotates to 90°C and drops<br>
into chute, v)        Same time signal is sent to dumper to open/close, vi)       Gripper goes back to its home position, vii)      Next cycle starts after pre-determined time delay through an external timer.<br>
Figure5 shows the schematic diagram of the complete system.<br>
The system contains 3 sections namely, manual system, Mechanical system and<br>
Pneumatic system.<br>
The pneumatic system consists of filters, direction control valves and flow control valves.<br>
The mechanical system comprises photo electric sensor for sensing the defects in the<br>
banjo bolts, a motor, spindle and fixture assembly to position the bolt, which has to be<br>
inspected. The pneumatic system and mechanical system are connected through<br>
pneumatic pipes. It also comprises a rotary encoder, which co ordinates the positioning of<br>
the bolt to be examined and sends these information to the central processing unit. The<br>
manual system consists of a programmable logic array, which is operated by a manual<br>
operator. The manual system coordinates the pneumatic and mechanical system.<br>
The banjo bolt inspection system of the present invention will be capable of sensing included angle variation due to defects in the hole (or no hole) by using high beam vs encoder arrangement. This combination of the system with a central processing unit and MMI will ensure that parts delivered to accepted bin will confirm to specialization and 100% defect free. Bad parts will get segregated providing scope for analysis and<br><br>
 improvement.<br>
All systems used for detecting bad parts in inspection process used either a light sensor/laser and rotating encoder in conjunction and develops a relation between rotation of the spindle with respect to a linear displacement sensor (in this case light beam), based on which the product evaluation and subsequent rejections are done. This system uses a combination of rotational position and distance by means of light beam to segregate parts in inspection to ensure zero defect and can be used on any manufacturing/inspection<br>
operation where a co-relation exists between linear distance and rotational position.<br>
Case Study:	Product:	M73780<br>
M10xl 0x 23 Banjo Bolt<br>
2 holes (Radial), One hole (axial)<br>
Setting cycle for radial hole:<br>
•	Adjust photo electric sensor slide and rotate the spindle and check the included angle in MMI.<br>
•	As per calculation the included angle = 30 degrees.<br>
•	The value recorded by MMI = 28° (This is mainly due to centering error while placing the component on to the fixture and hole diameter variation).<br>
•	Set the limit in MMI:	Lower: 25°<br>
Upper:   32°<br>
•	Found that any component enters less than 25° and more than 32° is rejected.<br>
•	Found that component which gives less than 25° is due to burrs blocked the hole partially and some dust lodged inside the hole.<br>
Setting Cycle for axial hole:<br>
•	The axial tool and cylinder reed switch is set for particular depth of the axial hole.<br>
•	If the axial hole depth is less or more from specified limit is found to be rejected.<br>
•	In some of the bolts, axial holes have not crossed the radial hole and duly rejected by the system due to length variation. Engine will be ceased if such bolts enters in engine<br><br>
lubrication circuit.<br>
ADVANTAGES:<br>
The present invention provides 100% defect free products.<br>
The present invention solves the problem of mixing of bad products with good products<br>
thereby resulting in cease of engine and customer complaints.<br><br><br>
