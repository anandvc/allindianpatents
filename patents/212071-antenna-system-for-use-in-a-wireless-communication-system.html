				<td>Filed of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an antenna system for use in a wireless communication system; and, more particularly, to an antenna system incorporated therein an array of phase shifters for steering beams in three-dimensional.<br>
Description of the Prior Art<br>
As is well known, it is sometimes desirable to adjust the orientation of a radiation beam emitted from a broadcast antenna. In particular, if a broadcast antenna is installed at a higher altitude than other antennas that communicate with the broadcast antenna, it must be tilted downward to steering a radiation beam emitted therefrom. This down tilting of the radiation beam alters a coverage angle and may reduce interference with nearby broadcast antennas, and may enhance communications with mobile users situated in valleys below the broadcast antenna.<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, there is shown a conventional antenna system 10, which is capable of mechanically down tilting a beam 16 radiated from an antenna 12 incorporated into the antenna system 10. The antenna is mounted atop a mast 14<br>
at a height above ground which is in many cases about 200 feet.<br>
In case when the orientation of a radiation beam is adjusted downward, the entire antenna 12 must be mechanically down tilted. One of the major shortcomings is that this approach is generally regarded as too rigid and too expensive. There is the approach that electrically down tilting the radiation beam by adjusting the relative phases of the radiation associated with each of several radiators of an antenna.<br>
Referring to Fig. 2, there is shown a schematic diagram illustrating a conventional antenna system 20, which is capable of electrically down-tilting a beam 26 radiated from an antenna array 22 incorporated into the antenna system 20. In the system, the antenna array 22 incorporates therein an array of radiators and a single point signal feed network provided with a scan network to couple the single point network to the array 22 of radiators. The scan network includes a plurality of transmission lines between the feed network and each radiator. Among these electrical down tilting methods is a capacitive coupling method, in which an adjustable capacitance is placed in series with the transmission lines to provide a plurality of signals to each radiator of the antenna array 22, thus causing the desired phase shifts. A phase shifter is associated with each radiator of the antenna array 22 such that the phase shifted beam from each radiator constructively interferes with the<br>
beam 26 from every other radiator to produce a composite beam radiating at an angle from a line normal to the surface of the antenna. By changing the phase shift provided by each phase shifter, the beam can be scanned across the antenna surface. Another such approach is to use different lengths of transmission lines for feeding the different elements to produce a permanent electrical down tilting.<br>
There are a number of problems associated with the above-described antenna systems 10, 20, however. First of all, both of the antenna systems 10, 20 cannot steer a radiation beam in horizontal direction.<br>
Another problem of the prior art is that it requires a number of phase shifters corresponding to the number of the transmission lines in the prior art antenna systems 10, 20.<br>
In addition, in the prior art antenna systems 10, 20, it requires a mechanically complex, for example using a rack and pinion assembly or a number of phase shifters corresponding to the number of radiators, for providing the desired phase shift.<br>
Further, the prior art antenna systems 10, 20 cannot modulate a width of beam in horizontal and in vertical.<br>
Finally, a beam is scanned in vertical and in horizontal by utilizing the prior art antenna systems, it has too much scan loss.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide an antenna array capable of electrically elevating a beam emitted therefrom by utilizing a multi-line phase shifter.<br>
It is another abject of the present invention to provide an antenna system for electrically steering a beam emitted therefrom in horizontal by using a multi-line phase shifter.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide an antenna system capable of electrically steering a. beam radiated therefrom in both vertical and Azimuth direction.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide an antenna system for selectively switching a beam width in horizontal by using a switchable divider.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
There are illustrated in Figs. 3 to 12 various views of an antenna system 100 for use in a wireless communication in accordance with preferred embodiments of the present invention.<br>
In Fig. 3, there is provided a block diagram of an antenna system 100 for use in a wireless communication system. The antenna system comprises a beam control board 110, a switchable divider block 120, a first phase shifter (P/S) block 150, a combiner/divider (C/D) block 160, a second P/S block 170 and an array 180 of M x N radiators, wherein M and N are positive integers, respectively. The array 180 includes M number columns C1 to CM and N number of rows RI to RN/ each of the columns C1 to CM including N number of radiators. For example, N numbers of radiators in the first column C1 represent R11 to RIN, respectively. The radiators in each column are vertically oriented and the columns C1 to CM are positioned parallel with each other. The antenna system 100 further comprises a vertical motor driver 130 and a horizontal motor driver 140. The switchable divider block 120 includes N<br>
number of switchable dividers 1201 to 120N and the C/D block 160 includes M number of C/Ds 1601 to 160N. And, The first P/S block 150 includes N number of first P/Ss 1501 to 150N and the second P/S block 170 includes M number of second P/Ss 1701 to 170M.<br>
In the system 100, a control signal is inputted to the beam control board 110 through a control port installed therein. The beam control board generates a first, a second and a third control signals, wherein the first control signal is used for horizontal beam width switching (HBWSw), the second control signal is used for horizontal beam steering (HBSt) and the third control signal is used for vertical beam down tilting (VBDT).<br>
Meanwhile, N number of signals is inputted to the switchable dividers 1201 to 120N through an input port. Each of the swichable dividers 1201 to 120N is capable of varying its operating mode.<br>
Referring to Fig. 4, there is a schematic representation of a switchable divider 1201 for use in the present invention. The switchable divider 1201 includes an input port RX1. for receiving an RF signal from the input port, first transmission lines 44n-44M1, second transmission lines 46n-46M1, isolation resistors 45n-45M1, output ports TXn-TXM1, a first switch 41 and a second switch 42. The switchable divider 1201 is described in an M-way operating mode. In the preferred embodiment, the switchable divider 1201 operates as a divider to equally divide the RF signal into M number of output<br>
signals at a maximum operating mode. The swichable divider 1201 can vary its operating mode based on the first control Signal from the beam control board 110 via line L10 The switchable divider 1201 is described in detail in commonly owned U.S. Pat. 5,872,491 issued Feb. 16, 1999, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Referring back to Fig. 3, each of the switchable dividers 1201 to 120N provides a plurality of divided signals to the first P/Ss 1501 to 150N through lines L41 to L4N/ respectively. In each of the switchable dividers 1201 to 120N, the number of divided signals is equal to that of the operating modes. In the preferred embodiment, the antenna system 100 can modulate a width of beam emitting from its antenna array 180 by changing the number of operating modes. The simulation data are shown in Figs. IDA to 10C.<br>
On the other hand, the horizontal motor driver 140 generates N number of motor control signals in response to the second control signal from the beam control board 110 through line L20. Each motor control signal is inputted to a corresponding first P/S via line L22 and used for rotating a dielectric member incorporated into the corresponding first P/S.<br>
Referring to Figs. 5 and 6, each of the divided signals from the output ports TXu to TXMN of the switchable divider block 120 is inputted to a corresponding input port of the first P/S block 150. For example, the divided signals from TXu to TXM1 are inputted to RXn to RXm of the first phase<br>
shifter 1501.<br>
Referring to Fig. 6, there is shown a detailed diagram representing a relationship between the first phase shifter 1501 and neighbor elements shown in Fig. 3. The first phase shifter 1501 includes a dielectric member (not shown), M number of transmission lines, M number of input ports RX- to RXM1 and M number of output ports TXn to TXM1. As shown in this figure, it is possible to simultaneously modulate phases of the divided signals from the switchable divider 1201 by rotating the dielectric member at a predetermined angle  1. The electrical lengths of the transmission lines located at a half portion increase to a predetermined degree, those of the other portion decrease to the predetermined degree, simultaneously. The first P/S 1501 is described in detail in commonly owned U.S. Patent application entitled: "SIGNAL PROCESS APPARATUS FOR PHASE-SHIFTING N NUMBER OF SIGNALS INPUTTED THERETO", Ser. No. to be determined, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, each of the first P/Ss 1501 to 150N can implement a horizontal beam steering. For example, if the horizontal motor driver 140 send a motor control signal to the first P/S 1601 to rotate the dielectric member at the predetermined angle  1. Half of divided signals from the switchable divider 1201 are phase-shifted in advance and the other are phase-delayed after passing through the first P/S 1501. Therefore, in the row RI of the antenna array 180, each of the radiators R11 to RM1 receives a different signal, which<br>
is linearly symmetric with respect to a center point of the row R1 That is, the antenna can electrically steering a beam emitted from the row R1 in horizontal based on the rotation of the dielectric member.<br>
The phase-shifted signals are transmitted to the C/D block 160 through line L50. The detailed description is described with reference to g. 7. The first phase shifter 1501, 1502 and 150N include output ports TXu to TXM1, TX21 to TX2M and TXIN to TXMN, respectively. And also, the CDs 1601, 1602 and 160M include input ports RXu to RX1N RX21 to RX2N and RXM1 to RXMN respectively. Each of the phase-shifted signals from the output ports TXn to TXMN is transmitted to a corresponding input port. For example, if a phase-shifted signal from the output port TX21 of the first phase shifter block 150 is transmitted to the input port RX21 of the C/D block 160. That is, an output port TXMN is connected to a input port RXMN in such a way that the sub-index of the output port TXMN corresponds to that of the input port RXMN<br>
Each of the C/Ds 1601 to 160M transmits the phase-shifted signals from the first P/Ss 1501-150M to the corresponding second phase shifter through lines" L71 to L7M as shown in Fig. 3. Each of the second phase shifter 1701-170M transmits the signals from the C/D block 160.<br>
Referring to Fig. 8, there is shown a detailed diagram representing a relationship between the second phase shifter 1701 and neighbor element shown in Fig. 3. The function and the structure of the second P/S 1701 is similar to those of<br>
the first P/S 1501 except that the second P/S 1701 has N number of transmission lines. And also, it is possible to simultaneously modulate phases of signals inputted to the input ports RX11 to RXNN by rotating the dielectric member at a predetermined angle  2- The electrical lengths of the transmission lines located at a half portion increase to a predetermined degree, those of the other portion decrease to the predetermined degree, simultaneously.<br>
Down tilting is used to decrease a cell size from a beam shape directed to the horizon to the periphery of the cell. This provides a reduction in beam coverage, yet allows a greater number of users to operate within a cell since there is a reduction in the number of interfering signals. In the preferred embodiment, this down tilting can be obtained by rotating the dielectric members incorporated into the second P/S 170; to 170M for each column C1 to CM. Specifically, in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the signals inputted through half of the input ports RXn to RXi(N-1)/2 are shifted in advance and the signals inputted through the input ports RXIN/2 to RX1N are delayed in phase after passing through the output ports TX11 to TXiN. The amount of shifted phase has a linear symmetry with respect to the center points of each column C1-CM due to a symmetric arrangement of the second phase shifter.<br>
Referring to Fig. 9, there is shown a schematic representation of a beam radiated from the antenna system with carrying out a down-tilt in accordance with the present<br>
invention. If the second P/S does not rotates the dielectric member, the signals outputted from the output ports TXn to TX1N are located at a phase plane PP1. In this case, the beam radiated from the array 180 of the radiators RU to RMN has a beam pattern BPi. Whereas, if the second P/S rotates the dielectric member to the predetermined angle  2, the signals outputted from the output ports TXu to TXIN are located at a phase plane PP2. Therefore, the beam radiated from the array 180 of the radiators RU to RMN has a beam pattern BP2 which is rotated a degrees from the beam pattern BP1.<br>
Referring to Fig. 10A, there are shown antenna gain plots on polar coordinate in the horizontal plane at the level of the antenna when the antenna system 100 of Fig. 3 implements the down tilting with rotating the dielectric members of the second P/Ss 1701 to 170M.<br>
Fig. 10B shows antenna gain plots on polar coordinate in the horizontal plane when the antenna system of Fig. 3 implements the horizontal beam steering with rotating the dielectric members of the first P/Ss 1501 to 150N.<br>
Fig. 10C plots an antenna gain when the antenna system of Fig. 3 implements the horizontally beam width switching. In this case, the array 180 is made of radiators R11 to R48 for applying IMT-2000. That is the number of columns is 4 and the number of rows is 8. The first phase shifter block 150 has only one first phase shifter in order to control all of the rows in the same manner. Therefore, the switchable divider block 120 has one switchable divider. The switchable divider<br>
is set to operate at 4-way at a maximum operating mode. As can be shown, when the switchable divider operates at 4-way, the beam radiated from the array 180 has a HPBW (half power beam width) to be approximately 32 degrees. If the switchable divider operates at 3-way, the beam has HPBW to be approximately 45 degrees. And, the switchable divider operates at 2-way, the beam has HPBW to be approximately 64 degrees.<br>
Fig. 11 represents a graph showing a comparison data between the present invention and a conventional antenna system based on PCS band due to no existing electrical tilting antenna for IMT-2000. A solid line, a dot line and one dot-dash line represent a no down tilting, a 3-way beam control and an existing electrical down tilting, respectively. When the prior art antenna is electrically down tilted, it has a scan loss with 0.9 dB and a side lobe level with 7.6 dB. Whereas, the antenna system 100 implements a 3-way beam control in accordance with the present invention, the beam radiated from the array 180 has a scan loss with 0.2 dB and a side lobe level with 12.7 dB. Therefore, the present invention can increase call quality and reducing interference.<br>
Fig. 12 is a diagram illustrating an exemplary application of the present invention for IMT-2000. In IMT-2000, the base station controls the cell on the basis of 6 sectors. Therefore, an antenna system must be installed in each sector. As can be shown, if the sector #1 is a high capacity zone, the antenna system 100 controls the beam with<br>
10 degrees of VBDT, -15 degrees of HBDS and 32 degrees of HBWS. On the other hand, if the sector #3 has a low capacity zone, the antenna system 100 controls the beam with 5 degrees of VBDT, 0 degree of HBDS and 64 degrees of HBWS, whereby the present invention can control the beam based on the communication environment.<br>
In comparison with the prior art antenna system, the present invention can implement a 3-way beam control. The 3-way beam control can implement simultaneously a vertical beam, electrical down tilt, a horizontal beam steering and a horizontal beam width switching. The present invention implement the vertical beam electrical d6wn tilt and the horizontal beam steering on the basis of column or row. This is achieved by utilizing a number multi-line phase shifters. The present invention also the horizontal beam width switching on the basis of row by utilizing a number of switchable dividers. The present invention can control cell coverage more flexible than any other prior arts by utilizing the 3-way beam control. .Therefore, the antenna system becomes friendly with user and the communication environment.<br>
As for the horizontal beam width switching, it should also be noted that the present invention is not limited to use of the switchable dividers in a different operating mode provided that the operating signals from the switchable dividers are transmitted to the corresponding radiators of the antenna array with maintaining an equal space each other.<br>
The present invention may implement a vertical beam width<br><br>
switching by replacing the C/Ds with switchable C/Ds.<br>
Further, the present invention can enhance performance and reduce cost by using a multi-line phase shifter.<br>
