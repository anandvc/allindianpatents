FIG. 4E illustrates one image frame of a "mother and daughter" as a test image and a test image segmented by the color image segmentation method according to the present invention.<br>
Best mode for carrying out the Invention<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, which illustrates a flowchart illustrating a color image segmentation method according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a color image is input (step 102), and pixel values of an input image are quantized into several representative pixel values (step 104) In order to classify an image in natural scenes, the representative pixel values<br><br>
consist of 10-20 values. In this embodiment, quantization is performed using three representative pixel values for convenience of explanation. Next, a class-map is formed by assigning labels corresponding to a quantized representative pixel values (step 106).<br>
More preferably, a window centered at a pixel to be processed in an entire image is defined. That is, when d is a positive integer, preferably between 3 and 10, a window B which is centered at a pixel p and has a size of d x d, is defined. Also, an assumption is made that i is the number between 1 and C, and Z, is a set of all the pixels in the window B. In other words, an assumption is made that Zi is classified into a C number of classes. Preferably, the d determining the size of the window is an integer inclusive of and between 3 and 10.<br>
Also, an assumption is made that mi is the average of positions of Ni data points in class Zi as: (equation 1)<br>
(Equation Removed)<br><br><br>
Also, Sr and Sw are defined by: (equation 2)<br>
(Equation Removed)<br><br><br>
(equation 3)<br>
(Equation Removed)<br><br><br>
respectively.<br>
Next, a J-value with respect to each pixel in a class-map is obtained (step 108). The J-value with respect to each pixel in the class-map is defined as follows, (equation 4)<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
The J-values obtained by equation 3 are converted into a gray scale value between 0 and 255, so that a gray scale image having values and capable of being referred to as a J-image is obtained (step 110). The J-image has the same form as a three-dimensional topographic map containing valleys and mountains that actually represent region centers and region boundaries, respectively.<br>
Lastly, the J-image is segmented based on a region growing method (step 112). The region growing method is known to one of ordinary skill in the art as a method used for the segmentation of a digital image, therefore, an explanation thereof is not given.<br>
FIGS. 2A through 2C illustrate class-maps and J-values formed according to a color image segmentation method of FIG. 1. The J-value at the center pixel is 1.720 in the class-map of FIG. 2A, and in the class-map of FIG. 2B, the J-value at the center pixel is 0, and in the class-map of FIG. 2C, the J-value at the center pixel is obtained as 0.855. Here, like in the class-map of FIG. 2A, in the case where pixels represented as + located at the left of the center pixel, pixels represented as 0 located at the right of the center pixel, and pixels represented as * located at the right of the center pixel form regions most clearly, the J-value is 1.720, a relative large value. Also, like in the class-map of FIG. 2B, in the case where the pixels represented as +, the pixels represented as 0, and the pixels represented as * are uniformly distributed and hardly form regions, the J-value is 0. Furthermore, like in the class-map of FIG. 2C, in the case where the pixels represented as * located at the right of the center pixel form regions, but the pixels represented as 0 and * hardly form regions, the J-value is 0.855. That is, the larger the J-value is, the more likely that the pixel is near to a region boundary, therefore, a segmentation based on the region growing method by using this point can be performed.<br><br>
FIGS. 3A and 3B illustrate segmented class-maps.<br>
It is necessary to check whether a segmentation is performed well with respect to each region in the segmented class-maps and to represent the same as quantized values. For this purpose, when Jk is the J-value obtained with respect to a k-region, and Mk is the number of pixel points of a k-th region, and N is the total number of pixel points in the class-map, the averaged J-value is calculated as: (equation 5)<br>
(Equation Removed)<br><br>
The calculated values are represented as quantized values whether a segmentation is performed well with respect to each region in the segmented class-maps or not.<br>
In the case of the segmented class-map shown in FIG. 3A, J is 0, on the other hand, in the case of the segmented class-map shown in FIG. 3B, J is 0.05. That is, in the case of regions of a fixed number, especially in the case of better segmentation, the averaged J-value is small. This occurs because the region contains a few uniformly distributed color classes in the case where a region is well segmented. Accordingly, the averaged J-value is small.<br>
FIG. 4A illustrates one image frame of a "container" as a test image and a test image segmented by the color image segmentation method according<br>
to the present invention.    Referring to FIG. 4A,  J  of an image before<br>
segmentation is 0.232, but, J of the image after segmentation is 0.071. Also, it is evident that regions in the test image are well segmented.<br>
FIG. 4B illustrates one image frame of a "foreman" as a test image and a test image segmented by the color image segmentation method according<br>
to the present invention.    Referring to FIG. 4B,   .7   of an image before<br>
segmentation is 0.238, but ./ of the image after segmentation is 0.1 05. Also, it is evident that regions in the test image are well segmented.<br><br>
FIG. 4C illustrates one image frame of a "coast" as a test image and a test image segmented by the color image segmentation method according to<br>
the present invention.     Referring to FIG. 4C,   7  of an image before<br>
segmentation is 0.494, but J of the image after segmentation is 0.093. Also, it is evident that regions in the test image are well segmented.<br>
FIG. 4D illustrates one image frame of a "flower garden" as a test image and a test image segmented by the color image segmentation method<br>
according to the present invention.   Referring to FIG. 4D, J of an image<br>
before segmentation is 0.435, but J of the image after segmentation is 0.088. Also, it is evident that regions in the test image are well segmented.<br>
FIG. 4E illustrates one image frame of a "mother and daughter" as a test image and a test image segmented by the color image segmentation<br>
method according to the present invention.   Referring to FIG. 4E, J of an<br>
image before segmentation is 0.438, but J of the image after segmentation is 0.061. Also, it is evident that regions in the test image are well segmented.<br>
That is, as described referring to FIG. 4A through 4E, J of the image segmented by the color image segmentation method according to the present invention is smaller than J of the image before segmentation.<br>
In the above embodiment, the calculation of a specific function is explained as an example, however, this is only for explanation. The scope of the present invention defined in the appended claims is not limited to the embodiment, and it is obvious that one of ordinary skill in the art can use another modified function representing the degree of difference from the color of peripheral pixels.<br>
Furthermore, the above color image segmentation method can be embodied in a computer program. Codes and code segments composing the program can be easily inferred to by a skilled computer programmer in the art. Also, the program can be stored in computer readable media, read and executed by a computer, and it can thereby realize the color image processing<br><br>
method. The media can include magnetic media, optical media, and carrier waves.<br>
As described above, according to the present invention, a color image can be automatically segmented without user's assistance and is robust with respect to an input image containing noise.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
In the above color image segmentation method according to the present invention, a robust segmentation is possible even when segmenting an image containing much noise or texture. Furthermore, an automatic segmentation is possible without user's assistance such as segmentation performed manually by a user, therefore, the segmentation speed is high. The color image segmentation method can be applied to object-based image processing such as that used in MPEG-7.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
