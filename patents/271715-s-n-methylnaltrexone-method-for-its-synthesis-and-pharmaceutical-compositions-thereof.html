(S)-N-METHYLNALTREXONE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to (5)-N-methylnaltrexone (S-MNTX), stereoselective<br>
synthetic methods for the preparation of S-MNTX, pharmaceutical preparations<br>
comprising S-MNTX and methods for their use.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Methylnaltrexone (MNTX) is a quaternary derivative of the pure opioid<br>
antagonist, naltrexone. It exists as a salt. Names used for the bromide salt of MNTX in<br>
the literature include: Methylnaltrexone bromide; JV-Methylnaltrexone bromide;<br>
Naltrexone methobromide; Naltrexone methyl bromide; MRZ 2663BR. MNTX was first<br>
reported in the mid-70s by Goldberg et al as described in US Patent No. 4,176,186. It is<br>
believed that addition of the methyl group to the ring nitrogen forms a charged<br>
compound with greater polarity and less liposolubility than naltrexone. This feature of<br>
MNTX prevents it from crossing the blood-brain barrier in humans. As a consequence,<br>
MNTX exerts its effects in the periphery rather than in the central nervous system with<br>
the advantage that it does not counteract the analgesic effects of opioids on the central<br>
nervous system.<br>
MNTX is a chiral molecule and the quaternary nitrogen can be in R or S<br>
configuration. (See FIG. 1.) It is unknown whether the different stereoisomers of MNTX<br>
exhibit different biological and chemical properties. All of the reported functions of<br>
MNTX described in the literature indicate that MNTX is a peripheral opioid antagonist.<br>
Some of these antagonist functions are described in U.S. Patents 4,176,186, 4,719,215,<br>
4,861,781, 5,102,887, 5,972,954, 6,274,591, 6,559,158, and 6,608,075, and in U.S.<br>
Patent Application Serial Nos. 10/163,482 (2003/0022909A1), 10/821,811<br>
(20040266806), 10/821,813 (20040259899) and 10/821,809 (20050004155). These uses<br>
include reducing the side-effects of opioids without reducing the analgesic effect of<br>
opioids. Such side-effects include nausea, emesis, dysphoria, pruritus, urinary retention,<br>
bowel hypomotility, constipation, gastric hypomotility, delayed gastric emptying and<br>
immune suppression. The art discloses that MNTX not only reduces the side-effects<br>
stemming from opioid analgesic treatment but also reduces the side-effects mediated by<br>
endogenous opioids alone or in conjunction with exogenous opioid treatment. Such side-<br><br>
WO 2006/127898<br><br>
PCT/US2006/020232<br><br>
-2-<br>
effects include inhibition of gastrointestinal motility, post-operative gastrointestinal<br>
dysfunction, idiopathic constipation and other such conditions including, but not limited<br>
to, those mentioned above. However, it is unclear from the art whether the MNTX used<br>
in these studies was a mixture of R and S stereoisomers or a single stereoisomer.<br>
The art suggests that isolated stereoisomers of a compound sometimes may have<br>
contrasting physical and functional properties, although it is unpredictable whether this is<br>
the case hi any particular circumstance. Dextromethorphan is a cough suppressant,<br>
whereas its enantiomer, levomethorphan, is a potent narcotic. R,R-methylphenidate is a<br>
drug to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), whereas its enantiomer,<br>
S,S-methylphenidate is an antidepressant. S-fluoxetine is active against migraine,<br>
whereas its enantiomer, R-fluoxetine is used to treat depression. The S enantiomer of<br>
citalopram is therapeutically active isomer for treatment of depression. The R enantiomer<br>
is inactive. The S enantiomer of omeprazole is more potent for the treatment of heartburn<br>
than the R enantiomer.<br>
Bianchetti et al, 1983 Life Science 33 (Sup I):415-418 studied three pairs of<br>
diastereoisomers of quaternary narcotic antagonist and their parent tertiary amines,<br>
levallorphan, nalorphine, and naloxone, to see how the configuration about the chiral<br>
nitrogen affected in vitro and in vivo activity. It was found that the activity varied<br>
considerably depending on how the quaternary derivatives were prepared. In each series,<br>
only the diastereomer obtained by methylation of the N-allyl-substituted tertiary amine<br>
(referred to as "N-methyl diastereomer") was potent in displacing H-naltrexone from rat<br>
brain membranes, and acting as a morphine antagonist in the guinea-pig ileum.<br>
Conversely, diastereoisomers obtained by reacting N-methyl-substituted tertiary amines<br>
with allyl halide (referred to as "N-allyl diastereomers") did not displace 3 H-naltrexone<br>
and had negligible antagonist activity and slight agonist action in the guinea-pig ileum.<br>
In vivo findings were generally consistent with those in vitro. Thus only the "N-methyl"<br>
but not the "N-allyl diastereomers" inhibited morphine-induced constipation in rats and<br>
behaved as antagonists. The author stated that the prepared materials appeared to be<br>
pure by *H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis, but these methods are<br>
not accurate. The author cites a literature reference for the assignment of the R<br>
configuration to the "N-methyl diastereomer" of nalorphine. No assignment is proposed<br>
for the levallorphan and naloxone diastereomers. It would be adventurous to extrapolate<br><br>
WO 2006/127898<br><br>
PCT/US2006/020232<br><br>
-3-<br>
the configuration to these diastereomers (RJ. Kobylecki et al, J. Med. Chem. 25, 1278-<br>
1280,1982).<br>
Goldberg et al.'s US Patent No. 4,176,186, and more recently Cantrell et al.'s<br>
WO 2004/043964 A2 describe a protocol for the synthesis of MNTX. Both describe a<br>
synthesis of MNTX by quaternizing a tertiary N-substituted morphinan alkaloid with a<br>
methylating agent. Both Goldberg et al. and Cantrell et al. are silent as to the<br>
stereoisomer(s) produced by the synthesis. The authors remained cautiously silent about<br>
the stereochemistry because the stereochemistry could not be determined based on prior<br>
art. The cyclopropylmethyl side-chain in naltrexone is different from the prior art side-<br>
chains and may have affected the stereochemical outcome in the synthesis of MNTX, as<br>
may other reaction parameters such as temperature and pressure. Based on the method<br>
of synthesis described in each, it is unknown whether the MNTX so produced was R, S<br>
or a mixture of both.<br>
S-MNTX in pure form, and a method of making pure S-MNTX have not been<br>
described in the literature. Researchers would have been unable to definitively<br>
characterize and distinguish the stereoisomer(s) obtained by the Goldberg et al. or<br>
Cantrell et al. synthesis in the absence of S-MNTX as a standard.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
S-MNTX has now been produced in high purity, permitting the characterization<br>
of its relative retention time in chromatography versus that of (i?)-JV-methymaltrexone<br>
(R-MNTX). S-MNTX has been found to have activity different from the activity of<br>
MNTX reported in the literature.<br>
The present invention provides highly pure S-MNTX, crystals of highly pure S-<br>
MNTX and intermediates thereof, novel methods for making highly pure S-MNTX,<br>
methods for analyzing S-MNTX in a mixture of R-MNTX and S-MNTX, methods of<br>
distinguishing R-MNTX from S-MNTX, methods of quantifying S-MNTX,<br>
pharmaceutical products containing the same and related uses of these materials.<br>
S-MNTX, and salts thereof are provided. A protocol for obtaining S-MNTX was<br>
unpredictable from the prior art. In addition, it has been discovered, surprisingly, that S-<br>
MNTX has opioid agonist activity.<br><br>

According to one aspect of the invention, a composition is provided. The<br>
composition is an isolated compound of the S configuration with respect to nitrogen of<br>
Formula I:<br><br>
wherein X is a counterion.<br>
S-MNTX is a salt. Therefore, there will be a counterion, which for the present<br>
application, includes the zwitterion. More typically, the counterion is a halide, sulfate,<br>
phosphate, nitrate, or anionic-charged organic species. Halides include fluoride,<br>
chloride, iodide and bromide. In some important embodiments, the halide is iodide and<br>
in other important embodiments the halide is bromide. In some embodiments the<br>
anionic-charged species is a sulfonate or a carboxylate. Examples of sulfonates include<br>
mesylate, besylate, tosylate, and triflate. Examples of carboxylates include formate,<br>
acetate, citrate, and fumarate.<br>
According to the invention, S-MNTX is provided in isolated form. By isolated, it<br>
is meant at least 50% pure. In important embodiments, S-MNTX is provided at 75%<br>
purity, at 90% purity, at 95% purity, at 98% purity, and even at 99% purity or above. In<br>
one important embodiment, the S-MNTX is in a crystal form.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, a composition is provided. The<br>
composition is MNTX, wherein the MNTX present in the composition is greater than .<br>
10% in S configuration with respect to nitrogen. More preferably, the MNTX present in<br>
the composition is greater than 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%,<br>
96%, 97%, 98%, 98.5%, 99%, 99.5%, 99.6%, 99.7%, 99.8%, and even 99.9% in S<br>
configuration with respect to nitrogen. In some embodiments there is no detectable R-<br>
MNTX as measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).<br>
The composition in some embodiments is a solution, in others an oil, in others a<br>
cream, and in still others a solid or semi-solid. In one important embodiment, the<br>
composition is a crystal.<br><br>

According to another aspect of the invention, a pharmaceutical preparation is<br>
provided. The pharmaceutical preparation includes any one of the compositions of S-<br>
MNTX described above in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The pharmaceutical<br>
preparation contains a effective amount of S-MNTX. In some embodiments, there is little<br>
or no detectable R-MNTX in the composition. If present, R-MNTX is at a level such<br>
that effective amounts of S-MNTX are administered to a subject. In some embodiments,<br>
the pharmaceutical preparation further includes a therapeutic agent other than MNTX. In<br>
one embodiment, the therapeutic agent is an opioid or opioid agonist. Examples of<br>
opioids or opioid agonists are alfentanil, anileridine, asimadoline, bremazocine,<br>
burprenorphine, butorphanol, codeine, dezocine, diacetylmorphine (heroin),<br>
dihydrocodeine, diphenoxylate, fedotozine, fentanyl, funaltrexamine, hydrocodone,<br>
hydromorphone, levallorphan, levomethadyl acetate, levorphanol, loperamide,<br>
meperidine (pethidine), methadone, morphine, morphine-6-glucuronide, nalbuphine,<br>
nalorphine, opium, oxycodone, oxymorphone, pentazocine, propiram, propoxyphene,<br>
remifentanyl, sufentanil, tilidine, trimebutine, tramadol, or combinations thereof. In<br>
some embodiments, the opioid or opioid agonist does not readily cross the blood brain<br>
barrier and, therefore, has substantially no central nervous system (CNS) activity when<br>
administered systemically (i.e., it is of the class of agents known as "peripherally<br>
acting") agents. In other embodiments the therapeutic agent is an opioid antagonist.<br>
Opioid antagonists include peripheral mu opioid antagonists. Examples of peripheral mu<br>
opioid antagonists include quarternary derivatives of noroxymorphone (See Goldberg et<br>
al, US Patent No. 4,176,186, and Cantrell et al WO 2004/043964), piperidine N-<br>
alkylcarboxylates such as described in U.S. patents 5,250,542; 5,434,171; 5,159,081;<br>
5,270,328; and 6,469,030, opium alkaloid derivatives such as described in U.S. patents<br>
4,730,048; 4,806,556; and 6,469,030, quaternary benzomorphan compounds such as<br>
described in U.S. patents 3,723,440 and 6,469,030.<br>
In one embodiment, the peripheral opioid antagonist is R-MNTX. R-MNTX is<br>
the predominant form of MNTX following the manufacturing procedures described in<br>
the prior art, although it is believed that such preparations are contaminated with S-<br>
MNTX. Pure R-MNTX can be synthesized using the following protocol. In brief,<br>
stereoselective synthesis of R-MNTX is carried out by adding a hydroxyl protecting<br>
group to naltrexone to yield 3-O-protected-naltrexone; methylating the 3-O-protected-<br>
naltrexone to yield 3-0-protected-R-MNTX salt; and removing hydroxyl protecting<br><br>
WO 2006/127898<br><br>
PCT/US2006/02O232<br><br>
-6-<br>
group to yield R-MNTX. The hydroxyl protecting group can be added in the presence of<br>
each or both: an organic solvent, e.g. tetrahydrofuran, and/or a tertiary amine that is not<br>
naltrexone, e.g. triethylamine. The naltrexone can be methylated by reacting the 3-0-<br>
protected-naltrexone with methyl iodide to produce 3-0-protected-R-MNTX iodide salt.<br>
Naltrexone can be protected by a hydroxyl protecting group such as isobutyryl. The 3-0-<br>
protected-R-MNTX iodid e salt can be treated with hydrobromic acid to remove the<br>
protecting group and produce R-MNTX bromide/iodide salt, and the bromide/iodide salt<br>
can be passed through an anion exchange resin column (bromide form) to yield R-<br>
MNTX bromide.<br>
In other embodiments, the therapeutic agent is not an opioid, opioid agonist, or an<br>
opioid antagonist. For example, the therapeutic agent can be an antiviral agent, antibiotic<br>
agent, antifungal agent, antibacterial agent, antiseptic agent, anti-protozoal agent, anti-<br>
parasitic agent, antiinflammatory agent, a vasoconstrictor agent, a local anesthetic agent,<br>
an anti-diarrheal agent, an anti-hyperalgesia agent, or combinations thereof.<br>
In one aspect of the invention, the S-MNTX is combined with an anti-diarrhea<br>
agent that is loperamide, loperamide analogs, N-oxides of loperamide and analogs,<br>
metabolites and prodrugs thereof, diphenoxylate, cisapride, antacids, aluminum<br>
hydroxide, magnesium aluminum silicate, magnesium carbonate, magnesium hydroxide,<br>
calcium carbonate, polycarbophil, simethicone, hyoscyamine, atropine, furazolidone,<br>
difenoxin, octreotide, lansoprazole, kaolin, pectin, activated charcoal, sulphaguanidine,<br>

subcarbonate, bismuth subcitrate, bismuth citrate, tripotassium dicitrato bismuthate,<br>
bismuth tartrate, bismuth subsalicylate, bismuth subnitrate and bismuth subgallate,<br>
opium tincture (paregoric), herbal medicines, plant-derived anti-diarrheal agents or<br>
combinations thereof.<br>
In one aspect of the invention, the S-MNTX is combined with an anti-<br>
inflammatory agent that is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSATD), a tumor<br>
necrosis factor inhibitor, basiliximah, daclizumab, infliximab, mycophenolate, mofetil,<br>
azothioprine, tacrolimus, steroids, sulfasalazine, olsalazine, mesalamine, or combinations<br>
thereof.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations of the invention can take on a variety of forms,<br>
including, but not limited to a composition that is enteric coated, a composition that is a<br>
controlled release or sustained release formulation, a composition that is a solution, a<br><br>

-7-<br>
composition that is a topical formulation, a composition that is a suppository, a<br>
composition that is lyophilized, a composition that is in an inhaler, a composition that is<br>
in a nasal spray device, and the like. The composition can be for oral administration,<br>
parenteral administration, mucosal administration, nasal administration, topical<br>
administration, ocular administration, local administration, etc. If parenteral, the<br>
administration can be subcutaneous, intravenous, intradermal, intraperitoneal, intrathecal,<br>
etc.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, a method for synthesizing S-MNTX<br>
salt is provided. The method involves combining (iodomethyl) cyclopropane with<br>
oxymorphone in a first solvent to produce an iodo salt of S-MNTX. Counterions then<br>
may be substituted, optionally, for iodide by transferring the iodo salt S-MNTX to a<br>
second solvent and exchanging iodide for a counterion other than iodide. In one<br>
important embodiment, the iodo salt of S-MNTX is transferred from the first solvent to a<br>
second solvent, and the iodide is exchanged in the second solvent for bromide to produce<br>
a bromo salt of S-MNTX. The preferred first solvent is a dipolar aprotic solvent. Most<br>
preferred is N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP). The preferred second solvent is at least<br>
isopropyl acetate or dioxane. The method of the invention also involves purifying the<br>
salt of S-MNTX by chromatography, recrystallization, or a combination thereof. In one<br>
embodiment, the purification is by multiple recrystailizations. The reaction can be<br>
carried out across a wide temperature spectrum and at atmospheric conditions. In<br>
important embodiments, the reaction in the first solvent is conducted under a controlled<br>
reaction temperature between 65° to 75° C, preferable at about 70° C, and the reaction in<br>
the second solvent is conducted at room temperature.<br>
More broadly, the method involves synthesizing S-MNTX plus counterion by<br>
combining a cyclopropylmethyl derivative with oxymorphone in a first solvent to<br>
produce the S-MNTX plus counterion. The cyclopropylmethyl derivative contains a<br>
leaving group. Preferably the leaving group is a halide or sulfonate . Preferably the<br>
leaving group is iodide. The first solvent may be a dipolar aprotic solvent. Examples of<br>
such solvents are N-methylpyrrolidone, dimethyl formamide, methylphosphoramide,<br>
acetone, 1,4-dioxane, and acetonitrile and combinations thereof. Preferred is N-<br>
methylpyrrolidone. The first solvent can be a dipolar protic solvent. Examples are 2-<br>
propanol, 1-propanol, ethanol, methanol. The method can further involve exchanging the<br>
counterion of S-MNTX with another counterion. Examples of counterions are bromide,<br><br>
WO 2006/127898<br><br>
PCT/US2006/020232<br><br>
-8-<br>
chloride, fluoride, nitrate, sulfonate, or carboxylate. The sulfonate can be mesylate,<br>
besylate, tosylate or triflate. The carboxylate can be formate, acetate, citrate and<br>
furnarate. The method can involve transferring the S-MNTX counterion to a second<br>
solvent prior to exchanging the counterion of S-MNTX with another counterion. The<br>
method can further involve purifying the S-MNTX plus counterion, for example by<br>
recrystallization, by chromatography or by both.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, method is provided for inhibiting<br>
diarrhea in a subject, by administering to a subject in need of such treatment a<br>
pharmaceutical composition containing S-MNTX in an amount effective to treat or<br>
prevent the diarrhea. The pharmaceutical preparation can be of the type described above.<br>
The diarrhea can be acute or chronic. The diarrhea can be caused by any variety of<br>
circumstances, alone or combined, such as caused by an infectious agent, food<br>
intolerance, food allergy, malabsorption syndrome, reaction to a medication or<br>
nonspecific etiology. In some embodiments, the diarrhea is associated with irritable<br>
bowel disease or with inflammatory bowel disease. In one embodiment the<br>
inflammatory bowel disease is celiac disease. In another embodiment the inflammatory<br>
bowel disease is Crohn's disease. In yet another embodiment, the inflammatory bowel<br>
disease is ulcerative colitis. In other embodiments the diarrhea results from stomach or<br>
bowel resection, removal of a gall bladder, or organic lesions. In other embodiments, the<br>
diarrhea is associated with a carcinoid tumor or vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-<br>
secreting tumor. In still other embodiments, the diarrhea is chronic functional<br>
(idiopathic) diarrhea.<br>
According to the invention, the S-MNTX may be administered in conjunction<br>
with an anti-diarrhea agent that is not S-MNTX. By in conjunction with, it is meant at<br>
the same time or close enough in time whereby both agents are treating the condition at<br>
the same time. In one embodiment, the agent is an opioid or an opioid agonist. In<br>
another embodiment, the agent is not an opioid or an opioid agonist.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, a method is provided for reducing a<br>
volume of discharge from a ileostomy or cholostomy in a subject. The method involves<br>
administering to a subject in need of such reduction a pharmaceutical composition<br>
containing S-MNTX in an amount effective to reduce the volume of discharge from the<br>
ileostomy or cholostomy. The pharmaceutical preparation can be of the type described<br>
above.<br><br>

According to another aspect of the invention, a method is provided for reducing a<br>
rate of discharge from a ileostomy or cholostomy in a subject. The method involves<br>

According to another aspect of the invention, a method for analyzing S-MNTX in<br>
a mixture of R-MNTX and S-MNTX is provided. The method involves conducting high<br>
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and applying S-MNTX to the<br>
chromatography column as a standard. The method preferably involves applying both S-<br>
MNTX and R-MNTX as standards to determine relative retention/elution times. Relative<br>
Retention times of R and S-MNTX are disclosed therein. In one aspect of this invention,<br>
the chromatography is conducted using two solvents, solvent A and solvent B, wherein<br>
solvent A is an aqueous solvent and solvent B is a methanolic solvent and wherein both<br>
A and B contain trifiuroacetic acid (TFA). Preferably, A is 0.1% aqueous TFA and B is<br>
0.1% methanolic TFA. In important embodiments the column comprises a bonded, end-<br>
capped silica. In important embodiments, the pore size of the column gel is 5 microns.<br>
In a most preferred embodiment, the column, flow rate and gradient program are as<br>
follows:<br>
Column:	Luna C18(2), 150x4.6 mm, 5 u<br>
Flow Rate:	1 mL/min<br>
Gradient Program:<br><br>
Time (min)	%A	%B<br>

Detection can be carried out conveniently by ultraviolet (UV) @ 230 nm wavelength.<br>
The foregoing HPLC also can be used to determine the relative amount of S-MNTX and<br>
R-MNTX by detennining the area under the respective R and S curves in the<br>
chromatogram produced.<br><br>

According to another aspect of the invention, methods are provided for ensuring<br>
the manufacture of S-MNTX (which is an opioid agonist) that is free of R-MNTX (which<br>
is an opioid antagonist). The methods permit for the first time the assurance that a<br>
pharmaceutical preparation of S-MNTX which is intended for agonist activity is not<br>
contaminated with a compound that opposes the activity of S-MNTX. In this aspect of<br>
the invention, a method is provided for manufacturing S-MNTX. The method involves:<br>
(a) obtaining a first composition containing S-MNTX, (b) purifying the first<br>
composition by chromatography, recrystallization or a combination thereof, (c)<br>
conducting HPLC on a sample of purified first composition using R-MNTX as a<br>
standard, and (d) determining the presence or absence of R-MNTX in the sample. In<br>
important embodiments, both R-MNTX and S-MNTX are used as standards to<br>
determine, for example, relative retention time of R-MNTX and S-MNTX. In one<br>
embodiment, the purifying is multiple recryallization steps or multiple chromatography<br>
steps. In another embodiment, the purifying is carried out until R-MNTX is absent from<br>
the sample as determined by HPLC. It should be understood, however, that the<br>
"purified first composition" in some aspects of the invention is not necessarily free of<br>
detectable R-MNTX. The presence of such R-MNTX, for example, might indicate that<br>
further pruification steps should be conducted if pure S-MNTX is desired. The methods<br>
can further involve packaging purified first composition that is free of HPLC detectable<br>
R-MNTX. The methods farther can include providing indicia on or within the packaged,<br>
purified first composition indicating that the packaged, purified first composition is free<br>
of HPLC detectable R-MNTX. The method further can involve packaging a<br>
pharmaceutical^ effective amount for treating anyone of the conditions described herein.<br>
The first composition containing S-MNTX can be obtained by the methods described<br>
herein. Pure R-MNTX can be obtained as described herein.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, a packaged product is provided.<br>
The package contains a composition comprising S-MNTX, wherein the composition is<br>
free of HPLC detectable R-MNTX, and indicia on or contained within the package<br>
indicating that the composition is free of detectable R-MNTX. The composition can take<br>
on a variety of forms, including, but not limited to, a standard for use in laboratory<br>
experiments, a standard for use in manufacturing protocols, or a pharmaceutical<br>
composition. If the composition is a pharmaceutical composition, then one important<br>
form of indicia is writing on a label or package insert describing the characteristics of the<br><br>
WO 2006/127898<br><br>
PCT/US2006/020232<br><br>
-14-<br>
pharmaceutical preparation. The indicia can indicate directly that the composition is free<br>
of R-MNTX, or it can indicate the same indirectly, by stating for example that the<br>
composition is pure or 100% S-MNTX. The pharmaceutical composition can be for<br>
treating any of the conditions described herein. The pharmaceutical composition can<br>
contain an effective amount of the pure S-MNTX and can take any of the forms<br>
described below as if specifically recited in this summary, including, but not limited to,<br>
solutions, solids, semi-solids, enteric coated materials and the like.<br>
These and other aspects of the invention are described in greater detail below.<br>

DETAILED DESCRD7TION<br>
The invention provides for the compound, S-MNTX, synthetic routes for<br>
stereoselective synthesis of S-MNTX, substantially pure S-MNTX, crystals of<br>
substantially pure S-MNTX, methods of analysis of S-MNTX, pharmaceutical<br>
preparations containing substantially pure S-MNTX, and methods for their use.<br>
S-MNTX, also called (S)-N-(cyclopropylmethyl)-noroxymorphone methyl salt<br>
has the structure in Formula I:<br><br><br>
WO 2006/127898<br><br>
PCT/US2006/020232<br><br>
-15-<br>
wherein X is a counterion. The counterion can be any counterion, including a<br>
zwitterion. Preferably the counterion is pharmaceutical^ acceptable. Counterions<br>
include halides, sulfates, phosphates, nitrates, and anionic-charged organic species. The<br>
halide can be iodide, bromide, chloride, fluoride, or combinations thereof. In one<br>
embodiment the halide is iodide. In a preferred embodiment the halide is bromide. The<br>
anionic-charged organic species may be a sulfonate or carboxylate.<br>
It is believed that the methods of manufacture and the agonist properties of S-<br>
MNTX apply equally to S-quarternary derivatives of noroxymorphone other than where<br>
the derivative is cyclopropylmethyl. Thus, the invention is intended to embrace S-<br>
quarternary derivatives of noroxymorphone where the cyclopropylmethyl is replaced<br>
with a moiety R, where R is a 1 -20 carbon hydrocarbyl consisting exclusively of carbon<br>
and hydrogen, including alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, and aryl, substituted or unsubstituted<br>
with hydrocarbons or with one or more atoms such as nitrogen, oxygen, silicon,<br>
phosphorus, boron, sulfur, or halogen (described in PCT publicationWO 2004/043964.)<br>
In important embodiments, R is allyl, chloroallyl, or propargyl. In important<br>
embodiments, the hydrocarbyl contains 4-10 carbons.<br>
"Alkyl", in general, refers to an aliphatic hydrocarbon group which may be<br>
straight, branched or cyclic having from 1 to about 10 carbon atoms in the chain, and all<br>
combinations and subcombinations of ranges therein. "Branched" refers to an alkyl group<br>
in which a lower alkyl group, such as methyl, ethyl or propyl, is attached to a linear alkyl<br>
chain. In certain preferred embodiments, the alkyl group is a Ci -C5 alkyl group, i.e., a<br>
branched or linear alkyl group having from 1 to about 5 carbons. In other preferred<br>
embodiments, the alkyl group is a Ci -C3 alkyl group, i.e., a branched or linear alkyl<br>
group having from 1 to about 3 carbons. Exemplary alkyl groups include methyl, ethyl,<br>
n-propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl,<br>
nonyl and decyl. "Lower alkyl" refers to an alkyl group having 1 to about 6 carbon<br>
atoms. Preferred alkyl groups include the lower alkyl groups of 1 to about 3 carbons.<br>
An "alkylating agent" is a compound that can be reacted with a starting material<br>
to bind, typically covalently, an alkyl group to the starting material. The alkylating agent<br>
typically includes a leaving group that is separated from the alkyl group at the time of<br>
attachment to the starting material. Leaving groups may be, for example, halogens,<br>
halogenated sulfonates or halogenated acetates. An example of an alkylating agent is<br>
cyclopropylmethyl iodide.<br><br>

"Organic solvent" has its common ordinary meaning to those of skill in this art.<br>
Exemplary organic solvents useful in the invention include, but are not limited to<br>
tetrahydrofuran, acetone, hexane, ether, chloroform, acetic acid, acetonitrile, chloroform,<br>
cyclohexane, methanol, and toluene. Anhydrous organic solvents are included.<br>
"Dipolar aprotic" solvents are protophilic solvents that cannot donate labile<br>
hydrogen atoms and that exhibit a permanent dipole moment. Examples include acetone,<br>
ethyl acetate, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), dimethyl formamide (DMF) and N-<br>
methylpyrrolidone.<br>
"Dipolar protic" solvents are those that can donate labile hydrogen atoms and that<br>
exhibit a permanent dipole moment. Examples include water, alcohols such as 2-<br>
propanol, ethanol, methanol, carboxylic acids such as formic acid, acetic acid, and<br>
propionic acid.<br>
S-MNTX exhibits properties different from those of R-MNTX and different<br>
properties from a mixture of S- and R- MNTX. Those properties include mobility on<br>
chromatography columns, biological and functional activity, and crystal structure. It is<br>
believed that the in vivo clearance rate, the side-effect profile, and the like may also<br>
differ from R-MNTX or mixtures of R-MNTX and S-MNTX. As discovered and<br>
claimed herein, pure S-MNTX behaves as an agonist of peripheral opioid receptors as<br>
demonstrated by inhibition of gastrointestinal transit. As a consequence, S-MNTX<br>
activity may be interfered with or antagonized by R-MNTX in mixtures containing both<br>
R-MNTX and S-MNTX. It therefore is highly desirable to have S-MNTX in isolated<br>
and substantially pure form.<br>
In one aspect of the invention, methods for the synthesis of S-MNTX are<br>
provided. S-MNTX may be produced at a purity of greater than or equal to 10%, 20%,<br>
30%, 40%, 50 %, 60 %, 70 %, 75%, 80 %, 85 %, 90 %, 95 %, 97 %, 98 %, 98.5%, 99%,<br>
and 99.5% area under the curve (AUC) based on chromatographic techniques. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the purity of S-MNTX is 98% or greater. The amount of R-<br>
MNTX in the purified S-MNTX may be less than or equal to about 90%, 80%, 70%,<br>
60%, 50 %, 40 %, 30 %, 20 %, 10 %, 5 %, 3 %, 2 %, 1 %, 0.5 %, 0.3 %, 0.2 %, 0.1 %<br>
(AUC) or undetectable by chromatographic techniques described herein. It will be<br>
apprriciated by the skilled artisan that the detection of the methods will depend upon the<br>
detection and quantitation limits of the employed technique. Quantitation Limit is the<br>
lowest amount of R-MNTX that can be consistently measured and reported, regardless of<br><br>
WO 2006/127898<br><br>
PCT/US2006/020232<br><br>
-17-<br>
variations in laboratories, analysts, instruments or reagent lots. Detection Limit is the<br>
lowest amount of R-MNTX in a sample which can be detected but not necessarily<br>
quantitated as an exact value. In one embodiment of the invention the detection limit is<br>
0.1% and the quantitation limit is 0.2%. In yet another embodiment the detection limit is<br>
0.02% and the quantitation limit is 0.05%.<br>
Various synthetic protocols were attempted to synthesize S-MNTX. Many of the<br>
syntheses failed to make S-MNTX or failed to make S-MNTX at acceptable purity levels<br>
or yields. In the successful method of the invention, S-MNTX was synthesized via the<br>
direct alkylation of oxymorphone while leaving the phenolic OH group of oxymorphone<br>
unprotected (FIG. 2). Oxymorphone was reacted with the methylcyclopropane species<br>
iodomethyl cyclopropane. The S-MNTX salt that results includes a counterion. such as<br>
iodide, that can then be exchanged for a preferred counterion such as bromide. The<br>
starting material in the synthesis of S-MNTX, oxymorphone, may be obtained at about<br>
95 % yield through the demethylation of oxycodone, for example, with boron tribromide.<br>
Alternatively, the oxymorphone may be obtained through commercial sources.<br>
An alkylation reaction may be performed in a solvent, or solvent system, that<br>
may be anhydrous. The solvent system may be a single solvent or may include a<br>
combination of two or more solvents. Suitable solvent systems may include dipolar<br>
aprotic solvents such as N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), dimethyl formamide (DMF),<br>
hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA), acetone, 1,4-dioxane and acetonitrile. and dipolar<br>
protic solvents such as 2-propanol. Solvent systems may also include dipolar aprotic<br>
solvents in combination with aliphatic ethers, such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), 1,2-<br>
dimethoxyethane (glyme), diethyleneglycol dimethyl ether (diglyme), 1,4-dioxane,<br>
methyl t-butyl ether (methyl 1,1,-dimethylethyl ether, or 2-methyl-2-methoxypropane)<br>
diethyl ether, other polar solvents may also be included in some embodiments. For<br>
instance, the solvent system may include acetone, methylethylketone, diethylketone (3-<br>
pentanone), and t-butylmethylketone(3,3-dimethylbutan-2-one). Alkylation solvent<br>
systems may also include aliphatic or alicyclic congeners of any of the compounds<br>
disclosed above. Solvent systems may include two or more solvents in any proportion<br>
and appropriate proportions for a particular alkylation reaction may be determined<br>
through routine experimentation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, surprisingly, NMP<br>
proved the preferred solvent.<br><br>
WO 2006/127898<br><br>
PCT/US2006/020232<br><br>
-18-<br>
The solvent may be used at a ratio of less than, greater than, or equal to about 1,<br>
2, 3,4, 5, 10 or more volumes. In some cases it may be preferred to minimize the<br>
amount of solvent used, such as when product is to be transferred from the solvent using<br>
a liquid/liquid extraction or when product is to be crystallized or when the solvent is to<br>
be removed from the product.<br>
The alkylating agent may be added to the starting material in various molar ratios,<br>
such as less than 8,12, 16,20, 24 or greater than 24 equivalents per equivalent of starting<br>
material. In some instances, it has been found that reaction efficiency (production of S-<br>
MNTX) may be substantially independent of the amount of alkylating agent used.<br>
In one set of embodiments, alkylation may be performed using the Finkelstein<br>
reaction. An alkyl halide, such as cyclopropylmethyl chloride, can be combined with a<br>
halide salt, such as sodium iodide, to continuously supply a reactive halogenated<br>
alkylating agent, such as cyclopropylmethyl iodide, that is replenished as it is consumed.<br>
Starting materials may be alkylated at atmospheric pressure in an open vessel or<br>
under pressure. The reaction is conducted such that the temperature is maintained or<br>
controlled over the reaction time at a prescribed temperature using methods/equipment as<br>
are known in the art. One device for maintaining a controlled temperature throughout<br>
the alkylation reaction is a heater/chiller unit. Controlling the temperature throughout the<br>
alkylation reaction inhibits or reduces temperature fluctuations. In one embodiment, the<br>
temperature does not exceed 110° C, preferably does not exceed 100° C. For example,<br>
oxyrnorphone may be alkylated in an open or closed vessel over a range of from 50 to<br>
100° C, 60 to 90° C, or 65 to 75° C. The reaction is allowed to proceed up to about 22<br>
hours, preferably for about 15 to 22 hours, more preferably about 16 to 20 hours. It is<br>
contemplated that reaction times may be shortened through the use of microwave<br>
irradiation. In one embodiment, reactants are placed in a closed vessel at 70° C for about<br>
17 hours to produce a product having a ratio of oxyrnorphone to S-MNTX of about 1:1.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the alkylation is conducted at 70° C for about 20 hours in an<br>
open vessel (atmospheric pressure) wrapped to reduce exposure to light.<br>
In some embodiments, S-MNTX may be isolated from the solvent in which it is<br>
produced. For example, the solvent may be removed from a residue containing the S-<br>
MNTX, or any S-MNTX may be transferred from the alkylation solvent to a transfer<br>
solvent. Transfer solvents may be polar or non-polar and may have boiling points below<br>
100°C. Transfer solvents may include esters, aldehydes, ethers, alcohols, aliphatic<br><br>
WO 2006/127898<br><br>
PCT/US2006/020232<br><br>
-19-<br>
hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons and halogenated hydrocarbons. Specific transfer<br>
solvents include, for example, dioxane, ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, methanol,<br>
ethanol, dichloromethane, acetonitrile, water, aqueous HBr, heptane, and MTBE. In one<br>
embodiment, a mixture of isopropyl acetate and dioxane can be used to at least partially<br>
isolate S-MNTX from NMP. Upon mixing one or more of these solvents with a solution<br>
of S-MNTX in NMP, a light colored solid may develop that becomes an oil over time.<br>
Any residue obtained from the solvent may be worked up to purify and isolate the<br>
product, S-MNTX. Purification and isolation may be done using methods known to<br>
those skilled in the art, such as by using separation techniques like chromatography,<br>
recrystalization, or combinations of various separation techniques as are known the art.<br>
hi one embodiment, flash chromatography using a CI 8 column may be used with an<br>
aqueous methanol solvent modified with 0.2 % HBr. Methanol content may vary from,<br>
for example, about 2.5 % to about 50 %. In a preferred embodiment, the S-MNTX is<br>
purified using recrystallization.The process may be repeated until desired purity of<br>
product is obtained. In one embodiment, S-MNTX is recrystallized at least two times,<br>
three times, or four or more times to achieve the desired level of purity. For example, S-<br>
MNTX may be obtained at purities of greater than or equal to 50 %, 80 %, 85 %, 90 %,<br>
95 %, 97 %, 98 % , 98.5 %, 99.8% (AUC) based on chromatographic techniques. Any<br>
impurities may include the starting material, oxymorphohe of less than 0.2%, with no<br>
detectable R-MNTX. Recrystallization may be achieved using a single solvent, or a<br>
combination of solvents. A preferred recrystallization is achieved by dissolving S-<br>
MNTX in a polar solvent, and then adding a less polar cosolvent. In a more preferred<br>
embodiment, S-MNTX is purified by recrystallization from methanol and the cosolvent<br>
CH2CI2/IPA (6:1). The recrystallization is repeated to achieve desired purity.<br>
S-MNTX, and its derivatives, are produced in the salt form. Derivatives such as<br>
zwitterions of S-MNTX are included. S-MNTX, as shown in FIG. 1, may include a<br>
positively charged quaternary ammonium group and may be paired with a counterion<br>
such as a monovalent or multivalent anion. These anions may include, for example,<br>
halides, sulfates, phosphates, nitrates and charged organic species such as sulfonates and<br>
carboxylates. Preferred anions include halides such as bromide, chloride, iodide,<br>
fluoride, and combinations thereof. In some embodiments, bromide is most preferred.<br>
Specific anions may be chosen based on factors such as, for example, reactivity,<br>
solubility, stability, activity, cost, availability and toxicity.<br><br>

Counterions of the S-MNTX salt can be exchanged for alternative counterions.<br>
Wlien an alternative counterion is desired, an aqueous solution of an S-MNTX salt can<br>
be passed over an anion exchange resin column to exchange some or all of the<br>
counterion of the S-MNTX salt for a preferred alternative counterion. Examples of anion<br>
exchange resins include AG 1-X8 in a 100 to 200 mesh grade, available from Bio-Rad.<br>
In another embodiment, the S-MNTX cation can be retained on a cation exchange resin<br>
and can then be exchanged by removing the S-MNTX from the resin with a salt solution<br>
that includes a preferred anion, such as bromide or chloride, forming the desired S-<br>
MNTX salt in solution.<br>
The S-MNTX of the present invention has numerous utilities. One aspect of the<br>
invention is S-MNTX as a chromatographic standard in identifying and distinguishing S-<br>
MNTX from other components in a sample in a chromatographic separation. Another<br>
aspect of the invention is the use of S-MNTX as a chromatographic standard in<br>
identifying and distinguishing S-MNTX in a mixture containing S-MNTX and R-<br>
MNTX. Isolated S-MNTX is also useful in the development of protocols for purifying<br>
and distinguishing S-MNTX from R-MNTX in reaction mixtures. Such protocols are<br>
described herein and also in co-pending application entitled "Synthesis of (R)-N-<br>
Methylnaltrexone", attorney docket number P0453.70119US00, filed on even date<br>
herewith.<br>
Tne S-MNTX may be provided in a kit form with instruction for its use as a<br>
standard. The kit may further comprise an authentic R-MNTX as a standard. The S-<br>
MNTX for use as a standard preferably has a purity of 99.8% or greater with no<br>
detectable R-MNTX.<br>
One aspect of the invention is a method of resolving and identifying S-MNTX<br>
and R-MNTX in a solution of MNTX. The S-MNTX also is useful in HPLC assay<br>
methods of quantifying an amount of S-MNTX in a composition or mixture in which the<br>
method comprises applying a sample of the composition or mixture to a chromatography<br>
column, resolving the components of the composition or mixture, and calculating the<br>
amount of S-MNTX in the sample by comparing the percentage of a resolved component<br>
in the sample with the percentage of a standard concentration of S-MNTX. The method<br>
is particularly useful in reverse phase HPLC chromatography. The S-MNTX of the<br>
present invention by virtue of its agonist activity on opioid receptors, is useful as a<br><br>
WO 2006/127898<br><br>
PCT/US2006/020232<br><br>
-21-<br>
standard of agonist activity in in vitro and in vivo opioid receptor assays such as those<br>
described herein.<br>
The S-MNTX can be used to regulate a condition mediated by one or more<br>
peripheral opioid receptors, prophylactically or therapeutically, to agonize peripheral<br>
opioid receptors, in particular peripheral mu opioid receptors. The subjects being<br>
administered S-MNTX may receive treatment acutely, chronically or on an as needed<br>
basis.<br>
The subjects to which the S-MNTX is administered are vertebrates, in particular<br>
mammals. In one embodiment the mammal is a human, nonhuman primate, dog, cat,<br>
sheep, goat, horse, cow, pig and rodent. In a preferred embodiment, the mammal is a<br>
human.<br>
Mu and other opioid receptors exist in the gastrointestinal tract. Of the major<br>
classes of opioid receptors in the GI tract, mu receptors are principally involved in<br>
modulation of GI activity. Kappa opioid receptors may play a role (Manara L et al Ann.<br>
Rev. Phamacol. Toxicol, 1985, 25:249-73). In general, the S-MNTX is used to prevent<br>
or treat conditions associated with the need for activation or modulation of opioid<br>
receptors, in particular, peripheral opioid receptors. Of interest is the use of S-MNTX to<br>
prevent or treat conditions associated with the need for activation or modulation of<br>
opioid receptors in the GI tract, in particular mu opioid receptors. Such conditions which<br>
may be prevented or treated include diarrhea and used to prevent or inhibit certain forms<br>
of gastrointestinal dysfunction including certain forms of inflammatory bowel syndrome,<br>
and eating and digestive disorders.<br>
In one aspect, S-MNTX can be used to treat diarrhea. Gastrointestinal function is<br>
regulated, at least in part, by one or more opioid receptors as well as endogenous opioids.<br>
Opioid antagonists are known to increase gastrointestinal motility and may thus be used<br>
effectively as a treatment for constipation. Opioid agonists on the other hand, in<br>
particular peripheral opioid agonists such as loperamide are known to decrease<br>
gastrointestinal motility and can be useful in treating diarrhea in mammals. S-MNTX as<br>
discovered by Applicants as an opioid agonist, can be administered to a patient in need of<br>
treatment for diarrhea. Diarrhea as used herein is defined as one or more of the<br>
following: 1) stool loose in consistency; 2) passing of greater than 3 stools per day;<br>
and/or 3) passing a stool volume of &gt; 200 g (150 ml) per day. S-MNTX is administered<br>
in an amount effective to prolong the transit time of intestinal contents resulting in<br><br>

reduced fecal volume, increase fecal viscosity and bulk density and diminished loss of<br>
fluid and electrolytes.<br>
The S-MNTX of the present invention by virtue of its opioid agonist activity is<br>
useful in the prevention and treatment of diarrhea having diverse etiology including acute<br>
and chronic forms of diarrhea, including chronic functional (idiopathic) diarrhea.<br>
Acute diarrhea or short-term diarrhea as used herein is diarrhea lasting less than 1<br>
week in duration, typically 1 to 3 days. Chronic diarrhea, ongoing or prolonged diarrhea<br>
as used herein is diarrhea lasting 1 week or longer duration. Chronic diarrhea may last<br>
for months or even years and may be continuous or intermittent. Various forms and<br>
causes of diarrhea which may benefit from treatment using S-MNTX include, but are not<br>
limited to those described below.<br>
Viral gastroenteritis or "stomach flu" caused by any virus including but not<br>
limited to rotavirus, Norwalk virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simples virus, Hepatitis<br>
virus, and Adenovirus, is amenable to treatment using S-MNTX.<br>
Food poisoning and traveler's diarrhea which occur from eating food or drinking<br>
water contaminated with organisms such as bacteria and parasites are amenable to<br>
treatment using S-MNTX. Bacteria commonly causing diarrhea include Escherichia<br>
coli, Salmonella, Shigella, Clostridia, Campylobacter, Yersinia, and Listeria. Parasites<br>
which cause diarrhea include Giardia lamblia, Entamaeba histolytica, and<br>
Cryptosporidium. Fungus which may cause diarrhea includes Candida.<br>
Certain medical conditions can also lead to diarrhea including malabsorption<br>
syndromes such as lactose intolerance, celiac disease (sprue or gluten malabsorption),<br>
cystic fibrosis, intolerance to the protein in cows milk or other specific foods like beans,<br>
or fruits. Allergies to specific foods is another condition which may cause<br>
gastrointestinal irritation and/or allergic reaction leading to diarrhea. Typical food<br>
allergens include peanuts, com and shellfish. Diarrhea caused by or associated with<br>
these medical conditions is amendable to treatment using S-MNTX of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Other medical conditions that lead to diarrhea, in particular chronic diarrhea<br>
include inflammatory bowel diseases which include Crohn's disease and ulcerative<br>
colitis, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and immune deficiency may also benefit from S-<br>
MNTX to prevent or treat the diarrhea.<br><br>

-23-<br>
S-MNTX is useful in preventing and treating diarrhea caused by medications<br>
and/or therapies such as antibiotics, laxatives containing magnesium, chemotherapeutics<br>
for cancer treatment and high dose radiation therapy.<br>
Diarrhea is also associated with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, nerve disorders such<br>
as autonomic neuropathy or diabetic neuropathy, carcinoid syndrome, vasoactive<br>
intestinal polypeptide-secreting tumor, and anatomical conditions of the gastrointestinal<br>
tract including short bowel syndrome, gastrectomy, bowel resection with or without<br>
ileostomy or colostomy, and removal of the gall bladder. Such conditions are amenable<br>
to treatment using S-MNTX.<br>
S-MNTX may be administered through any route, oral or parenteral, including<br>
intraperitoneal, intravenous, vaginal, rectal, intramuscular, subcutaneously, aerosol, nasal<br>
spray, transmucosal, transdermal, topical, colonic, and the like for the prevention and<br>
treatment of diarrhea.<br>
S-MNTX is also useful in methods of reducing a volume of discharge from a<br>
ileostomy or cholostomy in a subject. The S-MNTX is provided in an amount effective<br>
to reduce the volume of discharge from the ostomy, compared to the volume of discharge<br>
from the ostomy in the absence of S-MNTX. S-MNTX is also useful in controlling the<br>
rate of discharge from an ostomy, in particular in reducing the rate of discharge in a<br>
subject in need of lower rate of discharge.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, a method is provided for inhibiting<br>
gastrointestinal motility in a subject. The method involves administering to a subject in<br>
need of such inhibition a pharmaceutical composition containing S-MNTX in an amount<br>
effective to inhibit gastrointestinal motility in the subject. According to the invention,<br>
the S-MNTX may be administered in conjunction with another motility inhibiting agent<br>
that is not S-MNTX. In one embodiment, the agent is an opioid or an opioid agonist.<br>
Opioids and opioid agonists are described above. In another embodiment, the agent is<br>
not an opioid or an opioid agonist. Examples of such nonopioid gastrointestinal motility<br>
inhibiting agents include, for example, cisapride, antacids, aluminum hydroxide,<br>
magnesium aluminum silicate, magnesium carbonate, magnesium hydroxide, calcium<br>
carbonate, polycarbophil, simethicone, hyoscyamine, atropine, furazolidone, difenoxin,<br>

In another aspect, S-MNTX may be used to treat eating and digestive disorders.<br>
Eating disorders and digestive disorders amenable to treatment using S-MNTX according<br>
to the invention comprise, but are not limited to, the regulation of pathological<br>
imbalanced appetite, loss of appetite or diminished appetite, induced for example by<br>
pregnancy, cancer, infectious diseases such as influenza, HCV or HIV, as a result of<br>
catabolism, cachexy, anorexia, especially anorexia nervosa, dysorexia, dysponderosis,<br>
adiposity, bulimia, obesity, gastroparesis, especially neurogenic gastroparesis, diabetic<br>
gastroparesis, myogenic gastroparesis or gastroparesis induced by drugs, gastroatonia,<br>
gastroparalysis or enteroparesis, and stenosis of the gastrointestinal tract, especially<br>
stenosis of the pylorus.<br>
Pain has been defined in a variety of ways. For example, pain can be defined as<br>
the perception by a subject of noxious stimuli that produces a withdrawal reaction by the<br>
subject Analgesia, is the reduction of pain perception. Agents that selectively block an<br>
animal's response to a strong stimulus without obtunding general behavior or motor<br>
function are referred to as analgesics. Opiates and opioid agonists affect pain via<br>
interaction with specific opioid receptors. Given the discovery that S-MNTX has opiate<br>
agonist activity on gastrointestinal transit in rats, there is a rationale for using S-MNTX<br>
in treatment of pain.<br>
In general, administration of S-MNTX and derivatives thereof according to the<br>
invention can be used to facilitate management of pain that is associated with any of a<br>
wide variety of disorders, conditions, or diseases. "Pain" as used herein, unless<br>
specifically noted otherwise, is meant to encompass pain of any duration and frequency,<br>
including, but not limited to, acute pain, chronic pain, intermittent pain, and the like.<br>
Causes of pain may be identifiable or unidentifiable. Where identifiable, the origin of<br>
pain may be, for example, of malignant, non-malignant, infectious, non-infectious, or<br>
autoimmune origin. One embodiment is the management of pain associated with<br>
diseases, disorders, or conditions that require short-term therapy, e.g., dental procedures,<br><br>
WO 2006/127898<br><br>
PCT/US2006/020232<br><br>
-26-<br>
bone fractures, outpatient surgeries, for which therapy involves treatment over a period<br>
of hours up to 3 days. Of particular interest is the management of pain associated with<br>
disorders, diseases, or conditions mat require long-term therapy, e.g., chronic and/or<br>
persistent diseases or conditions for which therapy involves treatment over a period of<br>
several days (e.g., about 3 days to 10 days), to several weeks (e.g., about 2 weeks or 4<br>
weeks to 6 weeks), to several months or years, up to and including the remaining lifetime<br>
of the subject. Subjects who are not presently suffering from a disease or condition, but<br>
who are susceptible to such may also benefit from prophylactic pain management using<br>
the compositions and methods of the invention, e.g., prior to traumatic surgery. Pain<br>
amenable to therapy according to the invention may involve prolonged episodes of pain<br>
alternating with pain-free intervals, or substantially unremitting pain that varies in<br>
severity.<br>
In general, pain can be nociceptive, somatogenic, neurogenic, or psychogenic.<br>
Somatogenic pain can be muscular or skeletal (i.e., osteoarthritis, lumbosacral back pain,<br>
posttraumatic, myofascial), visceral (i.e., pancreatitis, ulcer, irritable bowel), ischemic<br>
(i.e., arteriosclerosis obliterans), or related to the progression of cancer (e.g., malignant<br>
or non-malignant). Neurogenic pain can be due to posttraumatic and postoperative<br>
neuralgia, can be related to neuropathies (i.e., diabetes, toxicity, etc.), and can be related<br>
to nerve entrapment, facial neuralgia, perineal neuralgia, postamputation, thalamic,<br>
causalgia, and reflex sympathetic dystrophy.<br>
Specific examples of conditions, diseases, disorders, and origins of pain<br>
amenable to management according to the present invention include, but are not<br>
necessarily limited to, cancer pain (e.g., metastasis or non-metastatic cancer),<br>
inflammatory disease pain, neuropathic pain, postoperative pain, iatrogenic pain (e.g.,<br>
pain following invasive procedures or high dose radiation therapy, e.g., involving scar<br>
tissue formation resulting in a debilitating compromise of freedom of motion and<br>
substantial pain), complex regional pain syndromes, failed-back pain (e.g., acute or<br>
chronic back pain), soft tissue pain, joints and bone pain, central pain, injury (e.g.,<br>
debilitating injuries, e.g., paraplegia, quadriplegia, etc., as well as non-debilitating injury<br>
(e.g., to back, neck, spine, joints, legs, arms, hands, feet, etc.)), arthritic pain (e.g.,<br>
rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, arthritic symptoms of unknown etiology, etc.),<br>
hereditary disease (e.g., sickle cell anemia), infectious disease and resulting syndromes<br>
(e.g., Lyme disease, AIDS, etc.), headaches (e.g., migraines), causalgia, hyperesthesia,<br><br>
WO 2006/127898<br><br>
PCT/US2006/020232<br><br>
-27-<br>
sympathetic dystrophy, phantom limb syndrome, denervation, and the like. Pain can be<br>
associated with any portion(s) of the body, e.g., the musculoskeletal system, visceral<br>
organs, skin, nervous system, etc.<br>
The methods of the invention can be used to manage pain in patients who are<br>
opioid naive or who are no longer opioid naive. Exemplary opioid naive patients are<br>
those who have not received long-term opioid therapy for pain management. Exemplary<br>
non-opioid naive patients are those who have received short-term or long-term opioid<br>
therapy and have developed tolerance, dependence, or other undesirable side effect. For<br>
example, patients who have intractable adverse side effects with oral, intravenous, or<br>
intrathecal morphine, transdermal fentanyl patches, or conventionally administered<br>
subcutaneous infusions of fentanyl, morphine or other opioid can achieve good analgesia<br>
and maintain favorable side-effects profiles with deliver of S-MNTX and derivatives<br>
thereof.<br>
The term "pain management or treatment" is used here to generally describe<br>
regression, suppression or mitigation of pain so as to make the subject more comfortable<br>
as determined by subjective criteria, objective criteria, or both. In general, pain is<br>
assessed subjectively by patient report, with the health professional taking into<br>
consideration the patient's age, cultural background, environment, and other<br>
psychological background factors known to alter a person's subjective reaction to pain.<br>
As mentioned above, S-MNTX can be administered together with a therapeutic<br>
agent that is not S-MNTX, including but not limited, therapeutic agents that are pain<br>
relieving agents. In one embodiment, the pain relieving agent is an opioid or opioid<br>
agonist. In another embodiment, the pain relieving agent is a nonopioid pain relieving<br>
agent such as a corticosteroid or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSATD). Pain<br>

tooth extraction.<br>
As a preventative or treatment for peripheral hyperalgesia, S-MNTX can be<br>
administered using any pathway that provides for delivery of the compound to an<br>
afflicted area. Administration may be oral or parenteral. Methods of administration also<br>
include topical and local administration. S-MNTX can be applied to any body surface<br>
including skin, joints, eyes, lips and mucosal membranes.<br>
S-MNTX may be delivered in combination with other compounds, such as those<br>
disclosed herein, that provide anti-hyperalgesic effects, including, but not limited to, pain<br>
medications, itching medications, anti-inflammatory agents, and the like. S-MNTX also<br>
may be administered with other compounds used to treat the conditions causing the<br>
inflammation, such as antivirals, antibacteriais, antifungals, and anti-infectives. These<br>
other compounds may act and be administered locally or systemically and may be part of<br>
the same composition or may be administered separately. Such compounds are<br>
described in greater detail below.<br>
Inflammation is often associated with an increase in Tumor Necrosis Factor<br>
(TNF) production and it is believed that a decrease in TNF production will result in a<br>
reduction in inflammation. Peripherally acting opioid agonists have been shown to<br>
decrease TNF production (U.S. Patent No. 6,190,691). The peripherally selective k-<br>
opioid, asimadoline, has been shown to be a potent anti-arthritic agent in an adjuvant-<br>
induced arthritis animal model (Binder, W. and Walker, J.S. Br. J. Pharma 124:647-<br>
654). Thus the peripheral opioid agonist activity of S-MNTX and derivatives thereof<br>
provide for prevention and treatment of inflammatory conditions. While not being<br>
bound by theory, the anti-inflammatory effect of S-MNTX and derivatives thereof may<br>
be through inhibition of TNF production, directly or indirectly. The S-MNTX or<br>
derivatives thereof may be administered systemically or locally. S-MNTX may be<br>
administered in combination with another TNF inhibitor such as loperamide and<br>
diphenoxylate or with other anti-inflammatory agents described herein.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention is prevention and/or treatment of a<br>
systemic inflammatory condition, preferably inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid<br><br>

arthritis, cachexia, asthma, Crohn's disease, endotoxin shock, adult respiratory distress<br>
syndrome, ischemic/reperfusion damage, graft-versus-host reactions, bone resorption,<br>
transplantation or lupus using S-MNTX or derivatives thereof.<br>
In still another group of embodiments, the inflammatory condition amenable to<br>
treatment using S-MNTX or derivatives thereof is associated with multiple sclerosis,<br>
diabetes or wasting associated with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or<br>
cancer.<br>
In one group of embodiments, a skin inflammatory condition, preferably<br>
psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, UV-induced inflammation, contact dermatitis or<br>
inflammation induced by other drugs, including, but not limited to RETIN-A (all-trans-<br>
retinoic acid) is amenable to treatment using S-MNTX or derivative thereof.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is a method of treating a non-allergic<br>
inflammatory skin condition comprising the administration of S-MNTX in an amount<br>
effective to treat the inflammatory condition. Non-allergic inflammatory skin conditions<br>
are associated with irritant contact dermatitis, psoriasis, eczema, pruritus, seborrheic<br>
dermatitis, nummular dermatitis, lichen planus, acne vulgaris, comedones, polymorphs,<br>
nodulokystic acne, conglobata, senile acne, secondary acne, medicinal acne, a<br>
' keratinization disorder, and blistery dermatoses.<br>
Certain patients particularly amenable to treatment are patients having the<br>
symptoms of any one of the foregoing conditions. The patients may have failed to obtain<br>
relief or ceased to obtain reliefer a consistent degree of relief of their symptoms using<br>
other therapies. Such patients are said to be refractory to the conventional treatments.<br>
The condition may be induced or a consequence of one or more diverse conditions<br>
including, but not limited to, a disease condition, a physical condition, a drug-induced<br>
condition, a physiological imbalance, stress, anxiety, and the like. The conditions may<br>
be an acute condition or chronic condition.<br>
Subjects can be treated with a combination of the S-MNTX and a therapeutic<br>
agent other than the S-MNTX. In these circumstances the S-MNTX and the other<br>
therapeutic agent(s) are administered close enough in time such that the subject<br>
experiences the effects of the various agents as desired, which typically is at the same<br>
time. In some embodiments the S-MNTX will be delivered first in time, in some<br>
embodiments second in time, and still in some embodiments at the same time. As<br>
discussed in greater detail below, the invention contemplates pharmaceutical<br><br>

PCTYUS2006/020232<br><br>
-32-<br>
preparations where the S-MNTX is administered in a formulation including another<br>
pharmaceutical agent. These formulations may be such as those described in U.S. Patent<br>
Application Serial No. 10/821,809, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its<br>
entirety herein. Included are solid, semisolid, liquid, controlled release and other such<br>
formulations.<br>
One important class of therapeutic agent which can be part of the prevention and<br>
treatment protocol together with the S-MNTX are opioids. It has been surprisingly found<br>
by Applicants that S-MNTX used in combination with the opioid, morphine results in an<br>
enhanced and apparently synergistic inhibition of gastrointestinal transit. Thus, the<br>
present invention provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising S-MNTX in<br>
combination with one or more opioids. This will permit alteration of doses not<br>
previously obtainable. For example, where a lower dose of opioid is desirable in treating<br>
certain peripherally mediated conditions this now is possible by combination with S-<br>
MNTX treatment.<br>
The opioid can be any pharmaceutically acceptable opioid. Common opioids are<br>
those selected from the group consisting of alfentanil, anileridine, asimadoline,<br>
bremazocine, burprenorphine, butorphanol, codeine, dezocine, diacetyhnorphine<br>
(heroin), dihydrocodeine, diphenoxylate, fedotozine, fentanyl, funaltrexamine,<br>
hydrocodone, hydromorphone, levailorphan, ievomethadyl acetate, levorphanol,<br>
loperamide, meperidine (pethidine), methadone, morphine, morphine-6-glucoronide,<br>
nalbuphine, nalorphine, opium, oxycodone, oxymorphone, pentazocine, propiram,<br>
propoxyphene, remifentanyl, sufentanil, tilidine, trimebutine, and tramadol.<br>
Depending on the desired effect to be achieved the opioid may be administered<br>
parenterally or other systemic route to affect both the central nervous system (CNS) and<br>
peripheral opioid receptors. The desired effect of the opioid in combination with S-<br>
MNTX may be prevention or treatment of diarrhea, prevention or treatment of pain from<br>
any cause or etiology including prevention or treatment of peripheral hyperalgesia. When<br>
the indication is prevention or treatment of peripheral hyperalgesia, it is desirable to<br>
provide an opioid which does not have concomitant CNS effects or alternatively to<br>
administer the opioid topically or locally such that the opioid does not substantially cross<br>
the blood brain barrier but provide an effect on peripheral opioid receptors.<br><br>

The pharmaceutical preparations of the invention, when used alone or in<br>
cocktails, are admdnistered in therapeutically effective amounts. A therapeutically<br>
effective amount will be determined by the parameters discussed below; but, in any<br><br>
WO 2006/127898<br><br>
PCT/US2006/020232<br><br>
-40-<br>
event, is that amount which establishes a level of the drag(s) effective for treating a<br>
subject, such as a human subject, having one of the conditions described herein. An<br>
effective amount means that amount alone or with multiple doses, or the rate of delivery<br>
necessary to delay the onset of, lessen the severity of, or inhibit completely, lessen the<br>
progression of, or halt altogether the onset or progression of the condition being treated<br>
or a symptom associated therewith. In the case of diarrhea, an effective amount can be,<br>
for example, that amount which results in one or more of the following : 1) decreasing<br>
the frequency of bowel movements; 2) increasing the consistency of the stool, and/or 3)<br>
decreasing the stool volume to less than 200 g per day. In one embodiment, an effective<br>
amount is an amount that results in 3 or less per bowel movments per day, preferably 2<br>
or less per day, more preferably 1 bowel movement per day. In certain instances, the<br>
amount is sufficient to decrease bowel movements within 12 hours of administration of<br>
the MNTX, 10 hours, 8 hours, 6 hours, 4 hours, 2 hours, 1 hour and even immediately<br>
upon administration, depending upon the mode of administration. Intravenous<br>
administration can produce an immediate effect. In restoring gastrointestinal function,<br>
an effective amount can be, for example, that amount necessary to increase oral-cecal<br>
transit time. For management or treatment of pain, an effective amount can be, for<br>
example, that amount to sufficient to make a subject more comfortable as determined by<br>
subjective criteria, objective criteria or both. In the case of peripheral hyperalgesia, an<br>
effective amount can be, for example, that amount which relieves a symptom of<br>
peripheral hyperalgesia such as hypersensitivity to pain or pruritis. For the prevention or<br>
treatment of inflammation, an effective amount can be, for example, the amount<br>
sufficient to reduce or lessen the redness, swelling, or tissue damage associated with the<br>
inflammation or to increase the mobility of an affected area such as a joint. When<br>
administered to a subject, effective amounts will depend, of course, on the particular<br>
condition being treated; the severity of the condition; individual patient parameters<br>
including age, physical condition, size and weight; concurrent treatment; frequency of<br>
treatment; and the mode of adirnnistration. These factors are well known to those of<br>
ordinary skill in the art and can be addressed with no more than routine experimentation.<br>
Generally, oral doses of S-MNTX will be from about 0.05 to about 40 mg/kg,<br>
from 0.05 to about 20.0 mg/kg, from about 0.05 to about 10 mg/kg, or from about 0.05 to<br>
about 5 mg/kg body weight per day. Generally, parenteral administration, including<br>
intravenous and subcutaneous administration, will be from about 0.001 to 1.0 mg/kg,<br><br>
WO 2006/127898<br><br>
PCT/US2006/020232<br><br>
-41-<br>
from about 0.01 to 1.0 mg/kg, or from about 0,1 to 1.0 mg/kg body weight depending on<br>
whether administration is as a bolus or is spread out over time such as with an I.V. drip.<br>
It is expected that doses ranging from about 0.05 to 0.5 mg/kg body weight will yield the<br>
desired results. Dosage may be adjusted appropriately to achieve desired drug levels,<br>
local or systemic, depending on the mode of administration. For example, it is expected<br>
that the dosage for oral administration of the S-MNTX in an enterically-coated<br>
formulation would be lower than in an immediate release oral formulation. In the event<br>
that the response in a patient is insufficient at such doses, even higher doses (or<br>
effectively higher dosage by a different, more localized delivery route) may be employed<br>
to the extent that the patient tolerance permits. Multiple doses per day are contemplated<br>
to achieve appropriate systemic levels of compounds. Appropriate systemic levels can<br>
be determined by, for example, measurement of the patient's peak or sustained plasma,<br>
level of the drug. "Dose" and "dosage" are used interchangeably herein.<br>
A variety of administration routes are available. The particular mode selected<br>
will depend, of course, upon the particular combination of drugs selected, the severity of<br>
the condition being treated, or prevented, the condition of the patient, and the dosage<br>
required for therapeutic efficacy. The methods of this invention, generally speaking,<br>
may be practiced using any mode of administration that is medically acceptable, meaning<br>
any mode that produces effective levels of the active compounds without causing<br>
clinically unacceptable adverse effects. Such modes of administration include oral,<br>
rectal, topical, transdermal, sublingual, intravenous infusion, pulmonary, intra-arterial,<br>
intra-adipose tissue, intra-lymphatic, intramuscular, intracavity, aerosol, aural (e.g., via<br>
eardrops), intranasal, inhalation, intra-articular, needleless injection, subcutaneous or<br>
intradermal (e.g., transdermal) delivery. For continuous infusion, a patient-controlled<br>
analgesia (PCA) device or an implantable drug delivery device may be employed. Oral,<br>
rectal, or topical administration may be important for prophylactic or long-term<br>
treatment. Preferred rectal modes of delivery include administration as a suppository or<br>
enema wash.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage<br>
form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. All<br>
methods include the step of bringing the compounds of the invention into association<br>
with a carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the<br>
compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing the compounds of the<br><br>
WO 2006/127898<br><br>
PCT/US2006/020232<br><br>
-42-<br>
invention into association with a liquid carrier, a finely divided solid carrier, or both, and<br>
then, if necessary, shaping the product.<br>
When administered, the pharmaceutical preparations of the invention are applied<br>
in pharmaceutically acceptable compositions. Such preparations may routinely contain<br>
salts, buffering agents, preservatives, compatible carriers, lubricants, and optionally oilier<br>
therapeutic ingredients. When used in medicine the salts should be pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable, but non-pharmaceutically acceptable salts may conveniently be used to<br>
prepare pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and are not excluded from the scope of<br>
the invention. Such pharmacologically and pharmaceutically acceptable salts include,<br>
but are not limited to, those prepared from the following acids: hydrochloric,<br>
hydrobromic, sulfuric, nitric, phosphoric, maleic, acetic, salicylic, p-toluenesulfonic,<br>
tartaric, citric, methanesulfonic, formic, succinic, naphthalene-2-sulfonic, pamoic, 3-<br>
hydroxy-2-naphthalenecarboxylic, and benzene sulfonic.<br>
It should be understood that when referring to MNTX, R- and S-MNTX, and<br>
therapeutic agent(s) of the invention, it is meant to encompass salts of the same. Such<br>
salts are of a variety well known to those or ordinary skill in the art. When used in<br>
pharmaceutical preparations, the salts preferably are pharmaceutically-acceptable for use<br>
in humans. Bromide is an example of one such salt.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations of the present invention may include or be<br>
diluted into a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier. The term "pharmaceutically-<br>
acceptable carrier" as used herein means one or more compatible solid or liquid fillers,<br>
diluents or encapsulating substances which are suitable for administration to a human or<br>
other mammal such as non-human primate, a dog, cat, horse, cow, sheep, pig, or goat.<br>
The term "carrier" denotes an organic or inorganic ingredient, natural or synthetic, with<br>
which the active ingredient is combined to facilitate the application. The carriers are<br>
capable of being commingled with the preparations of the present invention, and with<br>
each other, in a manner such that there is no interaction which would substantially impair<br>
the desired pharmaceutical efficacy or stability. Carrier formulations suitable for oral<br>
administration, for suppositories, and for parenteral administration, etc., can be found in<br>
Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa.<br>
Aqueous formulations may include a chelating agent, a buffering agent, an anti-<br>
oxidant and, optionally, an isotonicity agent, preferably pH adjusted to between 3.0 and<br>
3.5. Examples of such formulations that are stable to autoclaving and long term storage<br><br>

are described in co-pending U.S. Application Serial No. 10/821,811, entitled<br>
"Pharmaceutical Formulation."<br>
Chelating agents include, for example, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)<br>
and derivatives thereof, citric acid and derivatives thereof, niacinamide and derivatives<br>
thereof, sodium desoxycholate and derivatives thereof, and L-glutamic acid, N, N-<br>
diacetic acid and derivatives thereof.<br>
Buffering agents include those selected from the group consisting of citric acid,<br>
sodium citrate, sodium acetate, acetic acid, sodium phosphate and phosphoric acid,<br>
sodium ascorbate, tartaric acid, maleic acid, glycine, sodium lactate, lactic acid, ascorbic<br>
acid, imidazole, sodium bicarbonate and carbonic acid, sodium succinate and succinic<br>
acid, histidine, and sodium benzoate and benzoic acid, or combinations thereof.<br>
Antioxidants include those selected from the group consisting of an ascorbic acid<br>
derivative, butylated hydroxy anisole, butylated hydroxy toluene, alkyl gallate, sodium<br>
meta-bisulfite, sodium bisulfite, sodium dithionite, sodium thioglycollate acid, sodium<br>
formaldehyde sulfoxylate, tocopheral and derivatives thereof, monothiogiycerol, and<br>
sodium sulfite. The preferred antioxidant is monothiogiycerol.<br>
Isotonicity agents include those selected from the group consisting of sodium<br>
chloride, mannitol, lactose, dextrose, glycerol, and sorbitol.<br>
Preservatives that can be used with the present compositions include benzyl<br>
alcohol, parabens, thimerosal, chlorobutanol and preferably benzalkonium chloride.<br>
Typically, the preservative will be present in a composition in a concentration of up to<br>
about 2% by weight. The exact concentration of the preservative, however, will vary<br>
depending upon the intended use and can be easily ascertained by one skilled in the art.<br>
The compounds of the invention can be prepared in lyophilized compositions,<br>
preferably in the presence of a cryoprotecting agent such as mannitol, or lactose, sucrose,<br>
polyethylene glycol, and polyvinyl pyrrolidines. Cryoprotecting agents which result in a<br>
reconstitution pH of 6.0 or less are preferred. The invention therefore provides a<br>
lyophilized preparation of therapeutic agent(s) of the invention. The preparation can<br>
contain a cryoprotecting agent, such as mannitol or lactose, which is preferably neutral or<br>
acidic in water.<br>
Oral, parenteral and suppository formulations of agents are well known and<br>
commercially available. The therapeutic agent(s) of the invention can be added to such<br>
well known formulations. It can be mixed together in solution or semi-solid solution in<br><br>
WO 2006/127898<br><br>
PCT/US2006/020232<br><br>
-44-<br>
such fonrrulations, can be provided in a suspension within such formulations or could be<br>
contained in particles within such formulations.<br>
A product containing therapeutic agent(s) of the invention and, optionally, one or<br>
more other active agents can be configured as an oral dosage. The oral dosage may be a<br>
liquid, a semisolid or a solid. An opioid may optionally be included in the oral dosage.<br>
The oral dosage may be configured to release the therapeutic agent(s) of the invention<br>
before, after or simultaneously with the other agent (and/or the opioid). The oral dosage<br>
may be configured to have the therapeutic agent(s) of the invention and the other agents<br>
release completely in the stomach, release partially in the stomach and partially in the<br>
intestine, in the intestine, in the colon, partially in the stomach, or wholly in the colon.<br>
The oral dosage also may be configured whereby the release of the therapeutic agent(s)<br>
of the invention is confined to the stomach or intestine while the release of the other<br>
active agent is not so confined or is confined differently from the therapeutic agent(s) of<br>
the invention. For example, the therapeutic agent(s) of the invention may be an<br>
enterically coated core or pellets contained within a pill or capsule that releases the other<br>
agent first and releases the therapeutic agent(s) of the invention only after the therapeutic<br>
agent(s) of the invention passes through the stomach and into the intestine. The<br>
therapeutic agent(s) of the invention also can be in a sustained release material, whereby<br>
the therapeutic agent(s) of the invention is released throughout the gastrointestinal tract<br>
and the other agent is released on the same or a different schedule. The same objective<br>
for therapeutic agent(s) of the invention release can be achieved with immediate release<br>
of therapeutic agent(s) of the invention combined with enteric coated therapeutic agent(s)<br>
of the invention. In these instances, the other agent could be released immediately in the<br>
stomach, throughout the gastrointestinal tract or only in the intestine.<br>
The materials useful for achieving these different release profiles are well known<br>
to those of ordinary skill in the art. Immediate release is obtainable by conventional<br>
tablets with binders wrhich dissolve in the stomach. Coatings which dissolve at the pH of<br>
the stomach or which dissolve at elevated temperatures will achieve the same purpose.<br>
Release only in the intestine is achieved using conventional enteric coatings such as pH<br>
sensitive coatings which dissolve in the pH environment of the intestine (but not the<br>
stomach) or coatings which dissolve over time. Release throughout the gastrointestinal<br>
tract is achieved by using sustained-release materials and/or combinations of the<br><br>
WO 2006/127898<br><br>
PCTYUS2006/020232<br><br>
-45-<br>
immediate release systems and sustained and/or delayed intentional release systems (e.g.,<br>
pellets which dissolve at different pHs).<br>
In the event that it is desirable to release the therapeutic agent(s) of the invention<br>
first, the therapeutic agent(s) of the invention could be coated on the surface of the<br>
controlled release formulation in any pharmaceutically acceptable carrier suitable for<br>
such coatings and for permitting the release of the therapeutic agent(s) of the invention,<br>
such as in a temperature sensitive pharmaceutically acceptable carrier used for controlled<br>
release routinely. Other coatings which dissolve when placed in the body are well<br>
known to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
The therapeutic agent(s) of the indention also may be mixed throughout a<br>
controlled release formulation, whereby it is released before, after or simultaneously with<br>
another agent. The therapeutic agent(s) of the invention may be free, that is, solubilized<br>
within the material of the formulation. The therapeutic agent(s) of the invention also<br>
may be in the form of vesicles, such as wax coated micropellets dispersed throughout the<br>
material of the formulation. The coated pellets can be fashioned to immediately release<br>
the therapeutic agent(s) of the invention based on temperature, pH or the like. The<br>
pellets also can be configured so as to delay the release of the therapeutic agent(s) of the<br>
invention, allowing the other agent a period of time to act before (lie therapeutic agent(s)<br>
of the invention exerts its effects. The therapeutic agent(s) of the invention pellets also<br>
can be configured to release the therapeutic agent(s) of the invention in virtually any<br>
sustained release pattern, including patterns exhibiting first order release kinetics or<br>
sigmoidal order release kinetics using materials of the prior art and well known to those<br>
of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
The therapeutic agent(s) of the invention also can be contained within a core<br>
within the controlled release formulation. The core may have any one or any<br>
combination of the properties described above in connection with the pellets. The<br>
therapeutic agent(s) of the invention may be, for example, in a core coated with a<br>
material, dispersed throughout a material, coated onto a material or adsorbed into or<br>
throughout a material.<br>
It should be understood that the pellets or core may be of virtually any type.<br>
They may be drug coated with a release material, drug interspersed throughout material,<br>
drug adsorbed into a material, and so on. The material may be erodible or nonerodible.<br><br>
WO 2006/127898<br><br>
PCT/US2006/020232<br><br>
-46-<br>
The therapeutic agent(s) of the invention, may be provided in particles. Particles<br>
as used herein means nano or microparticles (or in some instances larger) which can<br>
consist in whole or in part of the therapeutic agent(s) of the inventions or the other agents<br>
as described herein. The particles may contain the therapeutic agent(s) in a core<br>
surrounded by a coating, including, but not limited to, an enteric coating. The<br>
therapeutic agent(s) also may be dispersed throughout the particles. The therapeutic<br>
agent(s) also may be adsorbed into the particles. The particles may be of any order<br>
release kinetics, including zero order release, first order release, second order release,<br>
delayed release, sustained release, immediate release, and any corabiiiation thereof, etc.<br>
The particle may include, in addition to the therapeutic agent(s), any of those materials<br>
routinely used in the art of pharmacy and medicine, including, but not limited to,<br>
erodible, nonerodible, biodegradable, or nonbiodegradable material or combinations<br>
thereof. The particles may be microcapsules which contain the antagonist in a solution<br>
or in a semi-solid state. The particles may be of virtually any shape.<br>
Both non-biodegradable and biodegradable polymeric materials can be used in<br>
the manufacture of particles for delivering the therapeutic agent(s). Such polymers may<br>
be natural or synthetic polymers. The polymer is selected based on the period of time<br>
over which release is desired. Bioadhesive polymers of particular interest include<br>
bioerodible hydrogels described by H.S. Sawhney, C.P. Pathak and J.A. Hubell in<br>
Macromolecules, (1993) 26:581-587, the teachings of which are incorporated herein.<br>
These include polyhyaluronic acids, casein, gelatin, glutin, polyaahydrides, polyacrylic<br>
acid, alginate, chitosan, poly(methyl methacrylates), poly(ethyl methacrylates),<br>
poly(butylmethacrylate), poly(isobutyl methacrylate), poly(hexylmethacrylate),<br>
poly(isodecyl methacrylate), poly(lauryl methacrylate), poly(phenyl methacrylate),<br>
poly(methyl acrylate), poly(isopropyl acrylate), poly(isobutyl acrylate), and<br>
poly(octadecyl acrylate).<br>
The therapeutic agent(s) may be contained in controlled release systems. The<br>
term "controlled release" is intended to refer to any drag-containing formulation in which<br>
the manner and profile of drug release from the formulation are controlled. This refers to<br>
immediate as well as nonirnmediate release formulations, with nommmediate release<br>
formulations including but not limited to sustained release and delayed release<br>
formulations. The term "sustained release" (also referred to as "extended release") is<br>
used in its conventional sense to refer to a drug formulation that provides for gradual<br><br>
WO 2006/127898<br><br>
PCT7US2006/020232<br><br>
-47-<br>
release of a drug over an extended period of time, and that preferably, although not<br>
necessarily, results in substantially constant blood levels of a drug over an extended time<br>
period. The term "delayed release" is used in its conventional sense to refer to a drug<br>
formulation in which there is a time delay between administration of the formulation and<br>
the release of the drug therefrom. "Delayed release" may or may not involve gradual<br>
release of drug over an extended period of time, and thus may or may not be "sustained<br>
release." These formulations may be for any mode of administration.<br>
Delivery systems specific for the gastrointestinal tract are roughly divided into<br>
three types: the first is a delayed release system designed to release a drug in response to,<br>
for example, a change in pH; the second is a timed-release system designed to release a<br>
drug after a predetermined time; and the third is a microflora enzyme system making use<br>
of the abundant enterobacteria in the lower part of the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., in a<br>
colonic site-directed release formulation).<br>
An example of a delayed release system is one that uses, for example, an acrylic<br>
or cellulosic coating material and dissolves on pH change. Because of ease of<br>
preparation, many reports on such "enteric coatings" have been made. In general, an<br>
enteric coating is one which passes through the stomach without releasing substantial<br>
amounts of drug in the stomach (i.e., less than 10% release, 5% release and even 1%<br>
release in the stomach) and sufficiently disintegrating in the intestinal tract (by contact<br>
with approximately neutral or alkaline intestine juices) to allow the transport (active or<br>
passive) of the active agent through the walls of the intestinal tract.<br>
Various in vitro tests for determining whether or not a coating is classified as an<br>
enteric coating have been published in the pharmacopoeia of various countries. A<br>
coating which remains intact for at least 2 hours, in contact with artificial gastric juices<br>
such as HC1 of pH 1 at 36 to 38 °C and thereafter disintegrates within 30 minutes in<br>
artificial intestinal juices such as a KH2PO4 buffered solution of pH 6.8 is one example.<br>
One such well known system is EUDRAGIT material, commercially available and<br>
reported on by Behringer, Manchester University, Saale Co., and the like. Enteric<br>
coatings are discussed further, below.<br>
A timed release system is represented by Time Erosion System (TES) by<br>
Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. and Pulsincap by R. P. Scherer. According to these<br>
systems, the site of drug release is decided by the time of transit of a preparation in the<br>
gastrointestinal tract. Since the transit of a preparation in the gastrointestinal tract is<br><br>
WO 2006/127898<br><br>
PCT/US2006/020232<br><br>
-48-<br>
largely influenced by the gastric emptying time, some time release systems are also<br>
enterically coated.<br>
Systems making use of the enterobacteria can be classified into those utilizing<br>
degradation of azoaromatic polymers by an azo reductase produced from enterobacteria<br>
as reported by the group of Ohio University (M. Saffran, et al., Science, Vol. 233: 1081<br>
(1986)) and the group of Utah University (J. Kopecek, et al, Pharmaceutical Research,<br>
9(12), 1540-1545 (1992)); and those utilizing degradation of polysaccharides by beta-<br>
galactosidase of enterobacteria as reported by the group of Hebrew University<br>
(unexamined published Japanese patent application No. 5-50863 based on a PCT<br>
application) and the group of Freiberg University (K. H. Bauer et al., Pharmaceutical<br>
Research, 10(10), S218 (1993)). In addition, the system using chitosan degradable by<br>
chitosanase by Teikoku Seiyaku K. K. (unexamined published Japanese patent<br>
application No. 4-217924 and unexamined published Japanese patent application No. 4-<br>
225922) is also included.<br>
The enteric coating is typically, although not necessarily, a polymeric material.<br>
Preferred enteric coating materials comprise bioerodible, gradually hydrolyzable and/or<br>
gradually water-soluble polymers. The "coating weight," or relative amount of coating<br>
material per capsule, generally dictates the time interval between ingestion and drug<br>
release. Any coating should be applied to a sufficient thickness such that the entire<br>
coating does not dissolve in the gastrointestinal fluids at pH below about 5, but does<br>
dissolve at pH about 5 and above. It is expected that any anionic polymer exhibiting a<br>
pH-dependent solubility profile can be used as an enteric coating in the practice of the<br>
present invention. The selection of the specific enteric coating material will depend on<br>
the following properties: resistance to dissolution and disintegration in the stomach;<br>
impermeability to gastric fluids and drug/carrier/enzyme while in the stomach; ability to<br>
dissolve or disintegrate rapidly at the target intestine site; physical and chemical stability<br>
during storage; non-toxicity; ease of application as a coating (substrate friendly); and<br>
economical practicality.<br>
Suitable enteric coating materials include, but are not limited to: cellulosic<br>
polymers such as cellulose acetate pTithalate, cellulose acetate trimellitate,<br>
hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate, hydroxypropyhmethyl cellulose succinate and<br>
carboxymethylcellulose sodium; acrylic acid polymers and copolymers, preferably<br>
formed from acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, methyl acrylate, ammonium methylacrylate,<br><br>
WO 2006/127898<br><br>
PCT/US2006/020232<br><br>
-49-<br>
ethyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate and/or ethyl methacrylate (e.g., those copolymers<br>
sold under the trade name EUDRAGIT); vinyl polymers and copolymers such as<br>
polyvinyl acetate, polyvinylacetate phthalate, vinylacetate crotonic acid copolymer, and<br>
ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers; and shellac (purified lac). Combinations of different<br>
coating materials may also be used. Well known enteric coating material for use herein<br>
are those acrylic acid polymers and copolymers available under the trade name<br>
EUDRAGIT from Rohm Pharma (Germany). The EUDRAGIT series E, L, S, RL, RS<br>
and NE copolymers are available as solubilized in organic solvent, as an aqueous<br>
dispersion, or as a dry powder. The EUDRAGIT series RL, NE, and RS copolymers are<br>
insoluble in the gastrointestinal tract but are permeable and are used primarily for<br>
extended release. The EUDRAGIT series E copolymers dissolve in the stomach. The<br>
EUDRAGIT series L, L-30D and S copolymers are insoluble in stomach and dissolve in<br>
the intestine, and are thus most preferred herein.<br>
A particular methacrylic copolymer is EUDRAGIT L, particularly L-30D and<br>
EUDRAGIT L 100-55. In EUDRAGIT L-30D, the ratio of free carboxyl groups to ester<br>
groups is approximately 1:1. Further, the copolymer is known to be insoluble in<br>
gastrointestinal fluids having pH below 5.5, generally 1.5-5.5, i.e., the pH generally<br>
present in the fluid of the upper gastrointestinal tract, but readily soluble or partially<br>
soluble at pH above 5.5, i.e., the pH generally present in the fluid of lower<br>
gastrointestinal tract. Another particular methacrylic acid polymer is EUDRAGIT S,<br>
which differs from EUDRAGIT L-30D in that the ratio of free carboxyl groups to ester<br>
groups is approximately 1:2. EUDRAGIT S is insoluble at pH.below 5.5, but unlike<br>
EUDRAGIT L-30D, is poorly soluble in gastrointestinal fluids having a pH in the range<br>
of 5.5 to 7.0, such as in the small intestine. This copolymer is soluble at pH 7.0 and<br>
above, i.e., the pH generally found in the colon. EUDRAGIT S can be used alone as a<br>
coating to provide drug delivery in the large intestine. Alternatively, EUDRAGIT S,<br>
being poorly soluble in intestinal fluids below pH 7, can be used in combination with<br>
EUDRAGIT L-30D, soluble in intestinal fluids above pH 5.5, in order to provide a<br>
delayed release composition which can be formulated to deliver the active agent to<br>
various segments of the intestinal tract. The more EUDRAGIT L-30D used, the more<br>
proximal release and delivery begins, and the more EUDRAGIT S used, the more distal<br>
release and delivery begins. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that both<br>
EUDRAGIT L-30D and EUDRAGIT S can be replaced with other pharmaceutically<br><br>

acceptable polymers having similar pH solubility characteristics. In certain<br>
embodiments of the invention, the preferred, enteric coating is ACRYL-EZE™<br>
(methacrylic acid co-polymer type C; Colorcon, West Point, PA).<br>
The enteric coating provides for controlled release of the active agent, such that<br>
drug release can be accomplished at some generally predictable location. The enteric<br>
coating also prevents exposure of the therapeutic agent and carrier to the epithelial and<br>
mucosal tissue of the buccal cavity, pharynx, esophagus, and stomach, and to the<br>
enzymes associated with these tissues. The enteric coating therefore helps to protect the<br>
active agent, carrier and a patient's internal tissue from any adverse event prior to drug<br>
release at the desired site of delivery. Furthermore, the coated material of the present<br>
invention allows optimization of drug absorption, active agent protection, and safety.<br>
Multiple enteric coatings targeted to release the active agent at various regions in the<br>
gastrointestinal tract would enable even more effective and sustained improved delivery<br>
throughout the gastrointestinal tract.<br>
The coating can, and usually does, contain a plasticizer to prevent the formation<br>
of pores and cracks that would permit the penetration of the gastric fluids. Suitable<br>
plasticizers include, but are not limited to, triethyl citrate (Citroflex 2), triacetin (glyceryl<br>
triacetate), acetyl triethyl citrate (Citroflec A2), Carbowax 400 (polyethylene glycol<br>
400), diethyl phthalate, tributyl citrate, acetylated monoglycerides, glycerol, fatty acid<br>
esters, propylene glycol, and dibutyl phthalate. In particular, a coating comprised of an<br>
anionic carboxylic acrylic polymer will usually contain approximately 10% to 25% by<br>
weight of a plasticizer, particularly dibutyl phthalate, polyethylene glycol, triethyl citrate<br>
and triacetin. The coating can also contain other coating excipients such as detackifiers,<br>
antifoaming agents, lubricants (e.g., magnesium stearate), and stabilizers (e.g.,<br>
hydroxypropylcellulose, acids and bases) to solubilize or disperse the coating material,<br>
and to improve coating performance and the coated product.<br>
The coating can be applied to particles of the therapeutic agent(s), tablets of the<br>
therapeutic agent(s), capsules containing the therapeutic agent(s) and the like, using<br>
conventional coating methods and equipment. For example, an enteric coating can be<br>
applied to a capsule using a coating pan, an airless spray technique, fluidized bed coating<br>
equipment, or the like. Detailed information concerning materials, equipment and<br>
processes for preparing coated dosage forms may be found in Pharmaceutical Dosage<br>
Forms: Tablets, eds. Lieberman et al. (New York: Marcel Dekker, Inc., 1989), and in<br><br>

Ansel et al., Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems, 6th Ed. (Media,<br>
PA: Williams &amp; Wilkins, 1995). The coating thickness, as noted above, must be<br>
sufficient to ensure that the oral dosage form remains intact until the desired site of<br>
topical delivery in the lower intestinal tract is reached.<br>
In another embodiment, drug dosage forms are provided that comprise an<br>
enterically coated, osmotically activated device housing a formulation of the invention.<br>
In this embodiment, the drag-containing formulation is encapsulated in a semipermeable<br>
membrane or barrier containing a small orifice. As known in the art with respect to so-<br>
called "osmotic pump" drug delivery devices, the semipermeable membrane allows<br>
passage of water in either direction, but not drug. Therefore, when the device is exposed<br>
to aqueous fluids, water will flow into the device due to the osmotic pressure differential<br>
between the interior and exterior of the device. As water flows into the device, the drug-<br>
containing formulation in the interior will be "pumped" out through the orifice. The rate<br>
of drug release will be equivalent to the inflow rate of water times the drug<br>
concentration. The rate of water influx and drug efflux can be controlled by the<br>
composition and size of the orifice of the device. Suitable materials for the<br>
semipermeable membrane include, but are not limited to, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl<br>
chloride, semipermeable polyethylene glycols, semipermeable polyurethanes,<br>
semipermeable polyamides, semipermeable sulfonated polystyrenes and polystyrene<br>
derivatives: semipermeable poly(sodium styrenesulfonate), semipermeable<br>
poly(vinylben2yltrimethylairunonium chloride), and cellulosic polymers such as<br>
cellulose acetate, cellulose diacetate, cellulose triacetate, cellulose propionate, cellulose<br>
acetate propionate, cellulose acetate butyrate, cellulose trivalerate, cellulose trilmate,<br>
cellulose tripalmitate, cellulose trioctanoate, cellulose tripropionate, cellulose<br>
disuccinate, cellulose dipalmitate, cellulose dicylate, cellulose acetate succinate,<br>
cellulose propionate succinate, cellulose acetate octanoate, cellulose valerate palmitate,<br>
cellulose acetate heptanate, cellulose acetaldehyde dimethyl acetal, cellulose acetate<br>
ethylcarbamate, cellulose acetate methylcarbamate, cellulose dimemylaminoacetate and<br>
ethylcellulose.<br>
In another embodiment, drug dosage forms are provided that comprise a<br>
sustained release coated device housing a formulation of the invention. In this<br>
embodiment, the drag-containing formulation is encapsulated in a sustained release<br>
membrane or film. The membrane may be semipermeable, as described above. A<br><br>
WO 2006/127898<br><br>
PCT/US2006/020232<br><br>
-52-<br>
semipermeable membrane allows for the passage of water inside the coated device to<br>
dissolve the drug. The dissolved drug solution diffuses out through the semipermeable<br>
membrane. The rate of drug release depends upon the thickness of the coated film and<br>
the release of drug can begin in any part of the GI tract. Suitable membrane materials for<br>
such a membrane include ethylcellulose.<br>
In another embodiment, drug dosage forms are provided that comprise a<br>
sustained release device housing a formulation of the invention. In this embodiment, the<br>
drug-containing formulation is uniformly mixed with a sustained release polymer. These<br>
sustained release polymers are high molecular weight water-soluble polymers, which<br>
when in contact with water, swell and create channels for water to diffuse inside and<br>
dissolve the drug. As the polymers swell and dissolve in water, more of drug is exposed<br>
to water for dissolution. Such a system is generally referred to as sustained release<br>
matrix. Suitable materials for such a device include hydropropyl methylcellulose,<br>
hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose and methyl cellulose.<br>
In another embodiment, drug dosage forms are provided that comprise an enteric<br>
coated device housing a sustained release formulation of the invention. In this<br>
embodiment, the drug containing product described above is coated with an enteric<br>
polymer. Such a device would not release any drug in the stomach and when the device<br>
reaches the intestine, the enteric polymer is first dissolved and only then would the drug<br>
release begin. The drag release would take place in a sustained release fashion.<br>
Entericaiiy coated, osmoticaily activated devices can be manufactured using<br>
conventional materials, methods and equipment. For example, osmoticaily activated<br>
devices may be made by first encapsulating, in a pharmaceutically acceptable soft<br>
capsule, a liquid or semi-solid formulation of the compounds of the invention as<br>
described previously. This interior capsule is then coated with a semipermeable<br>
membrane composition (comprising, for example, cellulose acetate and polyethylene<br>
glycol 4000 in a suitable solvent such as a methylene chloride-methanol admixture), for<br>
example using an air suspension machine, until a sufficiently thick laminate is formed,<br>
e.g., around 0.05 mm. The semipermeable laminated capsule is then dried using<br>
conventional techniques. Then, an orifice having a desired diameter (e.g., about 0.99<br>
mm) is provided through the semipermeable larninated capsule wall, using, for example,<br>
mechanical drilling, laser drilling, mechanical rupturing, or erosion of an erodible<br>
element such as a gelatin plug. The osmoticaily activated device may then be entericaiiy<br><br>

-53-<br>
coated as previously described. For osmotically activated devices containing a solid<br>
carrier rather than a liquid or semi-solid carrier, the interior capsule is optional; that is,<br>
the semipermeable membrane may be formed directly around the carrier-drug<br>
composition. However, preferred carriers for use in the drug-containing formulation of<br>
the osmotically activated device are solutions, suspensions, liquids, immiscible liquids,<br>
emulsions, sols, colloids, and oils. Particularly preferred carriers include, but are not<br>
limited to, those used for enterically coated capsules containing liquid or semisolid drug<br>
formulations.<br>
Cellulose coatings include those of cellulose acetate phthalate and trimellitate;<br>
methacrylic acid copolymers, e.g. copolymers derived from methylacrylic acid and esters<br>
thereof, containing at least 40% methylacrylic acid; and especially hydroxypropyl<br>
methylcellulose phthalate. Methylacrylates include those of molecular weight above<br>
100,000 daltons based on, e.g. methylacryiate and methyl or ethyl rnethyiacryiate in a<br>
ratio of about 1:1. Typical products include Endragit L, e.g. L 100-55, marketed by<br>
Rohm GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany. Typical cellulose acetate phthaiates have an acetyl<br>
content of 17-26% and a phthalate content of from 30-40% with a viscosity of ca. 45-90<br>
cP. Typical cellulose acetate trimellitates have an acetyl content of 17-26%, a trimellityl<br>
content from 25-35% with a viscosity of ca. 15-20 cS. An example of a cellulose acetate<br>
trimellitate is the marketed product CAT (Eastman Kodak Company, USA).<br>
Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthaiates typically have a molecular weight of from<br>
20,000 to 130,000 daltons, a hydroxypropyl content of from 5 to 10%, a methoxy content<br>
of from 18 to 24% and a phthalyl content from 21 to 35%. An example of a cellulose<br>
acetate phthalate is the marketed product CAP (Eastman Kodak, Rochester N.Y., USA).<br>
Examples of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthaiates are the marketed products having<br>
a hydroxypropyl content of from 6-10%, a methoxy content of from 20-24%, a phthalyl<br>
content of from 21-27%, a molecular weight of about 84,000 daltons, sold under the<br>
trademark HP50 and available from Shin-Etsu Chemical Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan, and<br>
having a hydroxypropyl content, a methoxyl content, and a phthalyl content of 5-9%, 18-<br>
22% and 27-35%, respectively, and a molecular weight of 78,000 daltons, known under<br>
the trademark HP55 and available from the same supplier.<br>
The therapeutic agents may be provided in capsules, coated or not. The capsule<br>
material may be either hard or soft, and as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art,<br>
typically comprises a tasteless, easily administered and water soluble compound such as<br><br>
WO 2006/127898<br><br>
PCT/US2006/020232<br><br>
-54-<br>
gelatin, starch or a cellulosic material. The capsules are preferably sealed, such as with<br>
gelatin bands or the like. See, for example, Remington: The Science and Practice of<br>
Pharmacy, Nineteenth Edition (Easton, Pa.: Mack Publishing Co., 1995), which<br>
describes materials and methods for preparing encapsulated pharmaceuticals.<br>
A product containing therapeutic agent(s) of the invention can be configured as a<br>
suppository. The therapeutic agent(s) of the invention can be placed anywhere within or<br>
on the suppository to favorably affect the relative release of the therapeutic agent(s). The<br>
nature of the release can be zero order, first order, or sigmoidal, as desired.<br>
Suppositories are solid dosage forms of medicine intended for administration via<br>
the rectum. Suppositories are compounded so as to melt, soften, or dissolve in the body<br>
cavity (around 98.6 °F) thereby releasing the medication contained therein. Suppository<br>
bases should be stable, nonirritating, chemically inert, and physiologically inert. Many<br>
commercially available suppositories contain oily or fatty base materials, such as cocoa<br>
butter, coconut oil, palm kernel oil, and palm oil, which often melt or deform at room<br>
temperature necessitating cool storage or other storage limitations. U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,837,214 to Tanaka et al. describes a suppository base comprised of 80 to 99 percent by<br>
weight of a lauric-type fat having a hydroxyl value of 20 or smaller and containing<br>
glycerides of fatty acids having 8 to 18 carbon atoms combined with 1 to 20 percent by<br>
weight diglycerides of fatty acids (which erucic acid is an example of). The shelf life of<br>
these type of suppositories is limited due to degradation. Other suppository bases<br>
contain alcohols, surfactants, and the like which raise the melting temperature but also<br>
can lead to poor absorption of the medicine and side effects due to irritation of the local<br>
mucous membranes (see for example, U.S. Patent No. 6,099,853 to Hartelendy et al.,<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,999,342 to Ahmad et al., and U.S. Patent No. 4,765,978 to Abidi et<br>
al.).<br>
The base used in the pharmaceutical suppository composition of this invention<br>
includes, in general, oils and fats comprising triglycerides as main components such as<br>
cacao butter, palm, fat, palm kernel oil, coconut oil, fractionated coconut oil, lard and<br>
WITEPSOL®, waxes such as lanolin and reduced lanolin; hydrocarbons such as<br>
VASELINE®, squalene, squalane and liquid paraffin; long to medium chain fatty acids<br>
such as caprylic acid, lauric acid, stearic acid and oleic acid; higher alcohols such as<br>
lauryl alcohol, cetanol and stearyl alcohol; fatty acid esters such as butyl stearate and<br>
dilauryl malonate; medium to long chain carboxylic acid esters of glycerin such as<br><br>

-55-<br>
triolein and tristearin; glycerin-substituted carboxylic acid esters such as glycerin<br>
acetoacetate; and polyethylene glycols and its derivatives such as macrogols and<br>
cetomacrogol. They may be used either singly or in combination of two or more. If<br>
desired, the composition of this invention may further include a surface-active agent, a<br>
coloring agent, etc., which are ordinarily used in suppositories.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition of this invention may be prepared by uniformly<br>
mixing predetermined amounts of the active ingredient, the absorption aid and optionally<br>
the base, etc. in a stirrer or a grinding mill, if required at an elevated temperature. The<br>
resulting composition, may be formed into a suppository in unit dosage form by, for<br>
example, casting the mixture in a mold, or by forming it into a gelatin capsule using a<br>
capsule filling machine.<br>
The compositions according to the present invention also can be administered as<br>
a nasal spray, nasal drop, suspension, gel, ointment, cream or powder. The<br>
administration of a composition can also include using a nasal tampon or a nasal sponge<br>
containing a composition of the present invention.<br>
The nasal delivery systems that can be used with the present invention can take<br>
various forms including aqueous preparations, non-aqueous preparations and<br>
combinations thereof. Aqueous preparations include, for example, aqueous gels,<br>
aqueous suspensions, aqueous liposomal dispersions, aqueous emulsions, aqueous<br>
microemulsions and combinations thereof. Non-aqueous preparations include, for<br>
example, non-aqueous gels, non-aqueous suspensions, non-aqueous liposomal<br>
dispersions, non-aqueous emulsions, non-aqueous microemulsions and combinations<br>
thereof. The various forms of the nasal delivery systems can include a buffer to maintain<br>
pH, a pharmaceutically acceptable thickening agent and a humectant. The pH of the<br>
buffer can be selected to optimize the absorption of the therapeutic agent(s) across the<br>
nasal mucosa.<br>
With respect to the non-aqueous nasal formulations, suitable forms of buffering<br>
agents can be selected such that when the formulation is delivered into the nasal cavity of<br>
a mammal, selected pH ranges are achieved therein upon contact with, e.g., a nasal<br>
mucosa. In the present invention, the pH of the compositions should be maintained from<br>
about 2.0 to about 6.0. It is desirable that the pH of the compositions is one which does<br>
not cause significant irritation to the nasal mucosa of a recipient upon administration.<br><br>

The viscosity of the compositions of the present invention can be maintained at a<br>
desired level using a pharmaceutically acceptable thickening agent. Thickening agents<br>
that can be used in accordance with the present invention include methyl cellulose,<br>
xanthan gum, carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, carbomer, polyvinyl<br>
alcohol, alginates, acacia, chitosans and combinations thereof. The concentration of the<br>
thickening agent will depend upon the agent selected and the viscosity desired. Such<br>
agents can also be used in a powder formulation discussed above.<br>
The compositions of the present invention can also include a humectant to reduce<br>
or prevent drying of the mucus membrane and to prevent irritation thereof. Suitable<br>
humectants that can be used in the present invention include sorbitol, mineral oil,<br>
vegetable oil and glycerol; soothing agents; membrane conditioners; sweeteners; and<br>
combinations thereof. The concentration of the humectant in the present compositions<br>
will vary depending upon the agent selected.<br>
One or more therapeutic agents may be incorporated into the nasal delivery<br>
system or any other delivery system described herein.<br>
A composition formulated for topical administration may be liquid or semi-solid<br>
(including, for example, a gel, lotion, emulsion, cream, ointment, spray or aerosol) or<br>
may be provided in combination with a "finite" carrier, for example, a non-spreading<br>
material that retains its form, including, for example, a patch, bioadhesive, dressing or<br>
bandage. It may be aqueous or non-aqueous; it may be formulated as a solution,<br>
emulsion, dispersion, a suspension or any other mixture.<br>
Important modes of administration include topical application to the skin, eyes or<br>
mucosa. Thus, typical vehicles are those suitable for pharmaceutical or cosmetic<br>
application to body surfaces. The compositions provided herein may be applied topically<br>
or locally to various areas in the body of a patient. As noted above, topical application is<br>
intended to refer to application to the tissue of an accessible body surface, such as, for<br>
example, the skin (the outer integument or covering) and the mucosa (the mucous-<br>
producing, secreting and/or containing surfaces). Exemplary mucosal surfaces include<br>
the mucosal surfaces of the eyes, mouth (such as the lips, tongue, gums, cheeks,<br>
sublingual and roof of the mouth), larynx, esophagus, bronchial, nasal passages, vagina<br>
and rectum/anus; in some embodiments, preferably the mouth, larynx, esophagus, vagina<br>
and rectum/anus; in other embodiments, preferably the eyes, larynx, esophagus,<br>
bronchial, nasal passages,and vagina and rectum/anus. As noted above, local application<br><br>
WO 2006/127898<br><br>
PCTTUS2006/020232<br><br>
-57-<br>
herein refers to application to a discrete internal area of the body, such as, for example, a<br>
joint, soft tissue area (such as muscle, tendon, ligaments, intraocular or other fleshy<br>
internal areas), or other internal area of the body. Thus, as used herein, local application<br>
refers to applications to discrete areas of the body.<br>
With respect to topical and/or local administration of the present compositions,<br>
desirable efficacy may involve, for example, penetration of therapeutic agent(s) of the<br>
invention into the skin and/or tissue to substantially reach a hyperalgesic site to provide<br>
desirable anti-hyperalgesic pain relief. The efficacy of the present compositions may be<br>
about the same as that achieved, for example, with central opiate analgesics. But, as<br>
discussed in detail herein, the efficacy achieved with therapeutic agent(s) of the<br>
invention is preferably obtained without the undesirable effects that are typically<br>
associated with central opiates including, for example, respiratory depression, sedation,<br>
and addiction, as it is believed that therapeutic agent(s) of the invention does not cross<br>
the blood brain barrier.<br>
Also in certain preferred embodiments, including embodiments that involve<br>
aqueous vehicles, the compositions may also contain a glycol, that is, a compound<br>
containing two or more hydroxy groups. A glycol which is particularly preferred for use<br>
in the compositions is propylene glycol. In these preferred embodiments, the glycol is<br>
preferably included in the compositions in a concentration of from greater than 0 to about<br>
5 wt. %, based on the total weight of the composition. More preferably, the<br>
compositions contain from about 0.1 to less than about 5 wt. % of a glycol, with from<br>
about 0.5 to about 2 wt. % being even more preferred. Still more preferably, the<br>
compositions contain about 1 wt. % of a glycol.<br>
For local internal administration, such as intra-articular administration, the<br>
compositions are preferably formulated as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous-based<br>
medium, such as isotonically buffered saline or are combined with a biocompatible<br>
support or bioadhesive intended for internal administration.<br>
Lotions, which, for example, may be in the form of a suspension, dispersion or<br>
emulsion, contain an effective concentration of one or more of the compounds. The<br>
effective concentration is preferably to deliver an effective amount, typically at a<br>
concentration of between about 0.1-50% [by weight] or more of one or more of the<br>
compounds provided herein. The lotions also contain [by weight] from 1% to 50% of an<br>
emollient and the balance water, a suitable buffer, and other agents as described above.<br><br>

glycols of molecular weight 200 to 3000, glycerol, sorbitol, sorbitan, polyoxyethylene<br>
sorbitol, polyoxyethylene sorbitan and hydrophilic wax esters. Suitable anionic<br>
emulsifiers include, but are not limited to, the fatty acid soaps, e.g., sodium, potassium<br>
and triethanolamine soaps, where the fatty acid moiety contains from 10 to 20 carbon<br>
atoms. Other suitable anionic emulsifiers include, but are not limited to, the alkali metal,<br>
ammonium or substituted ammonium alkyl sulfates, alkyl arylsulfonates, and alkyl<br>
ethoxy ether sulfonates having 10 to 30 carbon atoms in the alkyl moiety. The alkyl<br>
ethoxy ether sulfonates contain from 1 to 50 ethylene oxide units. Among satisfactory<br>
cationic emulsifiers are quaternary ammonium, morpholinium and pyridinium<br>
compounds. Certain of the emollients described in preceding paragraphs also have<br>
emulsifying properties. When a lotion is formulated containing such an emollient, an<br>
additional emulsifier is not needed, though it can be included in the composition.<br>
The balance of the lotion is water or a C2 or C3 alcohol, or a mixture of water and<br>
the alcohol. The lotions are formulated by simply admixing all of the components<br>
together. Preferably the compound, such as loperamide, is dissolved, suspended or<br>
otherwise uniformly dispersed in the mixture.<br>
Other conventional components of such lotions may be included. One such<br>
additive is a thickening agent at a level from 1% to 10% by weight of the composition.<br>
Examples of suitable thickening agents include, but are not limited to: cross-linked<br>
carboxypolymethylene polymers, ethyl cellulose, polyethylene glycols, gum tragacanth,<br>
gum kharaya, xanthan gums and bentonite, hydroxyethyl cellulose, and hydroxypropyl<br>
cellulose.<br>
Creams can be formulated to contain a concentration effective to deliver an<br>
effective amount of therapeutic agent(s) of the invention to the treated tissue, typically at<br>
between about 0.1%, preferably at greater than 1% up to and greater than 50%,<br>
preferably between about 3% and 50%, more preferably between about 5% and 15%<br>
therapeutic agent(s) of the invention. The creams also contain from 5% to 50%,<br>
preferably from 10% to 25%, of an emollient and the remainder is water or other suitable<br>
non-toxic carrier, such as an isotonic buffer. The emollients, as described above for the<br>
lotions, can also be used in the cream compositions. The cream may also contain a<br><br>
WO 2006/127898<br><br>
PCT/US2006/020232<br><br>
-61-<br>
suitable emulsifier, as described above. The emulsifier is included in the composition at<br>
a level from 3% to 50%, preferably from 5% to 20%.<br>
These compositions that are formulated as solutions or suspensions may be<br>
applied to the skin, or, may be formulated as an aerosol or foam and applied to the skin<br>
as a spray-on. The aerosol compositions typically contain [by weight] from 25% to 80%,<br>
preferably from 30% to 50%, of a suitable propellant. Examples of such propellants are<br>
the chlorinated, fluorinated and chlorofluorinated lower molecular weight hydrocarbons.<br>
Nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide, butane, and propane are also used as propellant gases.<br>
These propellants are used as understood in the art in a quantity and under a pressure<br>
suitable to expel the contents of the container.<br>
Suitably prepared solutions and suspensions may also be topically applied to the<br>
eyes and mucosa. Solutions, particularly those intended for ophthalmic use, may be<br>
formulated as 0.01%-10% isotonic solutions, pH about 5-7, with appropriate salts, and<br>
preferably containing one or more of the compounds herein at a concentration of about<br>
0.1%, preferably greater than 1%, up to 50% or more. Suitable ophthalmic solutions are<br>
known [see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,116,868, which describes typical compositions of<br>
ophthalmic irrigation solutions and solutions for topical application]. Such solutions,<br>
which have a pH adjusted to about 7.4, contain, for example, 90-100 mM sodium<br>
chloride, 4-6 mM dibasic potassium phosphate, 4-6 mM dibasic sodium phosphate, 8-12<br>
mM sodium citrate, 0.5-1.5 mM magnesium chloride, 1.5-2.5 mM calcium chloride, 15-<br>
25 mM sodium acetate, 10-20 mM D.L.-sodium, .p.-hydroxybutyrate and 5-5.5 mM<br>
glucose.<br>
Gel compositions can be formulated by simply admixing a suitable thickening<br>
agent to the previously described solution or suspension compositions. Examples of<br>
suitable thickening agents have been previously described with respect to the lotions.<br>
The gelled compositions contain an effective amount of therapeutic agent(s) of<br>
the invention, typically at a concentration of between about 0.1-50% by weight or more<br>
of one or more of the compounds provided herein.; from 5% to 75%, preferably from<br>
10% to 50%&gt;, of an organic solvent as previously described; from 0.5% to 20%,<br>
preferably from 1% to 10% of the thickening agent; the balance being water or other<br>
aqueous or non-aqueous carrier, such as, for example, an organic liquid, or a mixture of<br>
carriers.<br>
The formulations can be constructed and arranged to create steady state plasma<br><br>

PCT/US2006/020232<br><br>
-62-<br>
levels. Steady state plasma concentrations can be measured using HPLC techniques, as<br>
are known to those of skill in the art. Steady state is achieved when the rate of drug<br>
availability is equal to the rate of drug elimination from the circulation. In typical<br>
therapeutic settings, the therapeutic agent(s) of the invention will be administered to<br>
patients either on a periodic dosing regimen or with a constant infusion regimen. The<br>
concentration of drug in the plasma will tend to rise immediately after the onset of<br>
administration and will tend to fall over time as the drug is eliminated from the<br>
circulation by means of distribution into cells and tissues, by metabolism, or by<br>
excretion. Steady state will be obtained when the mean drug concentration remains<br>
constant over time. In the case of intermittent dosing, the pattern of the drug<br>
concentration cycle is repeated identically in each interval between doses with the mean<br>
concentration remaining constant. In the case of constant infusion, the mean drug<br>
concentration will remain constant with very little oscillation. The achievement of<br>
steady state is determined by means of measuring the concentration of drug in plasma<br>
over at least one cycle of dosing such that one can verify that the cycle is being repeated<br>
identically from dose to dose. Typically, in an intermittent dosing regimen, maintenance<br>
of steady state can be verified by determining drag concentrations at the consecutive<br>
troughs of a cycle, just prior to administration of another dose. In a constant infusion<br>
regimen where oscillation in the concentration is low, steady state can be verified by any<br>
two consecutive measurements of drug concentration.<br>
Fig. 7 shows a kit according to the invention. The kit 10 includes a vial 12<br>
containing opioid tablets. The kit 10 also includes a vial 14 containing S-MNTX tablets<br>
which comprise pellets, some of which are enterically coated with pH sensitive material<br>
and some of which are constructed and arranged to release the S-MNTX immediately in<br>
the stomach. The kit also includes instructions 20 for administering the tablets to a<br>
subject who has diarrhea or who has symptoms of diarrhea. The instructions include<br>
indicia, for example writing, indicating that the S-MNTX is pure S-MNTX free of R-<br>
MNTX.<br>
In some aspects of the invention, the kit 10 can include optionally or alternatively<br>
a pharmaceutical preparation vial 16 and a pharmaceutical preparation diluent vial 18.<br>
The vial containing the diluent for the pharmaceutical preparation is optional. The<br>
diluent vial contains a diluent such as physiological saline for diluting what could be a<br>
concentrated solution or lyophilized powder of S-MNTX. The instructions can include<br><br>

-63-<br>
instructions for mixing a particular amount of the diluent with a particular amount of the<br>
concentrated pharmaceutical preparation, whereby a final formulation for injection or<br>
infusion is prepared. The instructions 20 can include instructions for treating a patient<br>
with an effective amount of S-MNTX. It also will be understood that the containers<br>
containing the preparations, whether the container is a bottle, a vial with a septum, an<br>
ampoule with a septum, an infusion bag, and the like, can contain additional indicia such<br>
as conventional markings which change color when the preparation has been autoclaved<br>
or otherwise sterilized.<br>
This invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and<br>
the arrangement of components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the<br>
drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or of<br>
being carried out in various ways. Also, the phraseology and terminology used herein is<br>
for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting. The use of<br>
"including," "comprising," or "having," "containing", "involving", and variations<br>
thereof herein, is meant to encompass the items listed thereafter and equivalents thereof<br>
as well as additional items.<br>
Examples<br>
A number of different synthetic pathways and protocols were attempted to find an<br>
efficient method for the production and purification of S-MNTX. A description of some<br>
of these are provided below. Also provided are procedures for producing reagents,<br>
intermediates and starting materials.<br>
Example I<br>
Deprotection of Oxycodone to Oxymorphone. Oxymorphone was synthesized<br>
from oxycodone. The deprotection of oxycodone to oxymorphone was done using<br>
conditions previously described in the literature. (lijima, I.; Minamikawa, J.; Jacobson,<br>
A. E.; Brossi, A.; Rice, K. C. J. Med. Chem. 1978, 21(A), 398.) Yields ranged from 58-<br>
64% with purification consisting of filtration through a short plug of silica gel to remove<br>
baseline material. Purified oxymorphone was used for the alkylation reactions. Yields<br>
of oxymorphone up to 95% were obtained without purification. HPLC purities of this<br>
crude material were typically about 94%.<br><br>
WO 2000/127898<br><br>
PCT/US2006/020232<br><br>
-64-<br>
Preparation of (Iodomethyl)cyclopropane. (Iodomethyl)cyclopropane was<br>
prepared from (bromomethyi)cyclopropane through a Finlcelstein reaction. Typical<br>
yields ranged from 68-70% and typical purities were 89-95% (AUC) by GC, with the<br>
starting bromide as the only major impurity.<br>
Direct Alkylation of Oxymorphone. Direct alkylation of oxymorphone with<br>
cyclopropylmethyliodide as the alkylating agent proved to give productive yields of S-<br>
MNTX. The pathway is illustrated in FIG. 2. The direct alkylation of oxymorphone was<br>
observed to proceed to nearly 50% conversion as observed by HPLC (AUC), and was<br>
investigated further.<br>
Oxymorphone was combined with, cyclopropylmetbyl iodide in NMP (10 vol)<br>
and heated to 70 °C. The results are summarized below in Table 1. The decomposition<br>
of the alkylating agent did not completely consume the reagent during the reaction time<br>
and thus was not limiting the reaction from proceeding to completion. In addition, the<br>
ratio of oxymorphone to S-MNTX showed that the reaction proceeded to nearly 1:1<br>
regardless of the number of equivalents of alkylating agent.<br>

Work up procedure. Since the presence of NMP in the crude product was<br>
found to prevent retention, a means of removing it was required. A mixture of<br>
isopropyl acetate and dioxane formed a flocculent, a light colored solid that eventually<br>
became an oil. The use of isopropyl acetate and the mixture of isopropyl<br>
acetate/dioxane were compared to determine which was more effective at removing the<br>
NMP. In each case, the product and starting material were precipitated from the<br>
mixture and NMP remained in solution. Analysis of the supernatant liquid and the<br>
precipitated material by HPLC showed no significant difference between the two.<br><br>
WO 2006/127898<br><br>
PCT/US2006/020232<br><br>

Purification. Once the NMP was removed from the product, the residue was<br>
subjected to repetitive sequential reverse-phase chromatography using Biotage Flash<br>
chromatography systems, equipped with CI8 cartridges. Initial chromatography was<br>
carried out using 50% aqueous methanol containing 0.2% HBr as a modifier. The<br>
solvent system was incrementally reduced in methanol content until 5% aqueous<br>
methanol was settled upon. The chromatography was repeated until S-MNTX was<br>
isolated at a purity of 89% (AUC). The counterion was not detectable by MS, but was<br>
expected to be a mixture of iodide and bromide.<br>
With the workup and purification defined, the chemistry was scaled up and 28 g<br>
of oxycodone-HCl was carried through the process. The first step, demethylation, was<br>
carried out in one reaction using the procedure described in the literature and afforded 17<br>
g of oxymorphone, after recrystallization from hot ethanol (10 volumes). The second<br>
step was carried out in five equal smaller reactions because of equipment limitations<br>
resulting from the size and mode of heating of the pressure tubes. Although analyzed<br>
separately, the mixtures were combined for the workup and purification after analysis<br>
indicated similar composition. The isopropyl acetate trituration proceeded as expected<br>
and the precipitated residue was dissolved into 20% aqueous methanol containing 0.2%<br>
HBr and was purified by chromatography on a Biotage Flash 40s, equipped with a CI 8<br>
cartridge and eluted with 5% aqueous methanol containing 0.2% FfBr. The fractions<br>
were analyzed by HPLC and the fractions of similar composition were combined,<br>
separated into 
concentrated and rechromatographed on a Biotage Flash 75L, equipped with a CI 8<br>
cartridge. This chromatographic procedure was repeated to enhance the purity.<br>
Eventually it was discovered that the HBr modifier was unnecessary and was removed<br>
from the eluent. After six chromatographic purifications, nearly 11 g of S-MNTX iodide<br>
was isolated at approximately 80% purity (AUC).<br>
It became apparent that during the concentration of the fractions that some form<br>
of decomposition was occurring and resulted in a significant darkening of the product.<br>
The decomposition was attributed to the iodide counterion and, thus, the material was<br>
passed through an anion-exchange column to exchange the iodide for bromide. Once the<br>
eluent containing product was collected, concentration did not appear to result in the<br>
familiar darkening and afforded a yellow oil. The chromatography was continued,<br>
separating the product streams by purity level (AUC by HPLC). Once the bulk of the<br><br>
WO 2006/127898<br><br>
PCT/US2006/020232<br><br>
-66-<br>
material had been enhanced to approximately 90% purity, additional chromatography<br>
was carried out using 2.5% aqueous methanol as the eluent and eventually improved the<br>
purity of some material to &gt;95% (AUC).<br>
All the product streams were combined and lyophilized to afford free-flowing<br>
powders, 741 mg of S-MNTX was isolated at 95% pure, 2.5 g of S-MNTX was isolated<br>
at 90% purity, and 1.0 g of S-MNTX was isolated at 79% purity (AUC). The fractions of<br>
recovered oxymorphone were collected and recrystallized from ethanol to afford 2.4 g<br>
(&gt;99% purity, AUC).<br>
Reagent Preparation. In a series of experiments directed to producing S-<br>
MNTX, starting materials and reagents were obtained or made as described below.<br>
Equipment and instrumentation data are also provided.<br>
All nonaqueous reactions were performed under dry nitrogen. Unless otherwise<br>
noted, reagents were purchased from commercial sources and used as received. Proton<br>
nuclear magnetic resonance spectra were obtained on a Broker Avance 300 spectrometer<br>
at 300 MHz with tetramethylsilane used as an internal reference. Carbon nuclear<br>
magnetic resonance spectra were obtained on a Bruker Avance 300 Spectrometer at 75<br>
MHz with the solvent peak used as the reference. Infrared spectra were obtained on a<br>
Perkin-Elmer Spectrum 1000 spectrophotometer. Mass spectra were obtained on a<br>
Finnigan mass spectrometer.<br>
Thin layer chromatography (TLC) was performed using 2.5 x 10 cm Anaitech<br>
Silica Gel GF plates (25 microns thick). Visualization of TLC plates was performed<br>
using UV and potassium permanganate stain. HPLC analysis was performed on a Varian<br>

The synthesis and purification of S-MNTX were monitored using the above<br>
HPLC protocol. S-MNTX is distinguished from R-MNTX using the HPLC conditions<br>
described. Authentic R-MNTX for use as a standard may be made using the protocol<br>
described herein. In a typical HPLC run, S-MNTX elutes about 0.5 minutes before R-<br>
MNTX elutes. The retention time of S-MNTX is approximately 9.3 minutes; the<br>
retention time of R-MNTX is about 9.8 minutes.<br>

Typical Alkylation Reaction. The substrate was charged to a 250-mL Parr flask<br>
along with 10 volumes alkylating agent. If dimethyl formamide (DMF) or NMP was<br>
used as a cosolvent, 2.5 volumes were added. The flask was placed in a Parr shaker<br>
(hydrogen tank closed off) and heated to the reaction temperature with shaking under<br>
pressure. Pressures typically seen during the reaction were 10-15 psi. The reaction was<br>
periodically sampled and analyzed by MS and HPLC to determine the extent of reaction<br>
and the nature of the products. At the end of the reaction, the mixture was transferred to<br>
a round-bottom flask with methanol and the volatiles removed. The residue was then<br>
chromato graphed on silica gel eluting with 90:10:0.1 methylene<br>
chloride/methanol/ammonium hydroxide.<br>
Preparation of the Ion-Exchange Column. AG 1-X8 resin (Bio-Rad, analytical<br>
grade, 100-200 mesh, chloride form) was packed into a glass column (50 mm * 200<br>
mm) and was washed with 1 N HBr (1 L, prepared with deionized (DI) water). The<br>
column was washed with DI water (approximately 10 L) until the eluent reached a pH of<br>
6-7.<br>
Preparation of S-MNTX. Into five, 25-mL threaded closure pressure tubes were<br>
combined oxymorphone (3.6 g, 11.9 mmol), cyclopropylmethyl iodide (17.39 g, 95.6<br>
mrnoi), and N-methyi pyrrolidone (3.6 ink). The tubes were sealed with threaded Teflon<br>
caps and placed into a 6-well reactor block, preheated to 70 °C. After 24 h, the reactions<br>
were visibly biphasic and HPLC analysis, sampling both solid and liquid phases, showed<br>
that the reactions proceeded to approximately 50% conversion. Heating was<br>
discontinued and the five reaction mixtures were transferred to a 1-L, round-bottom flask<br>
using methanol to transfer the mixtures and rinse the tubes. The methanol was removed<br>
under reduced pressure and the resulting NMP solution was treated with isopropyl<br>
acetate (900 mL), which resulted in both solid and oily precipitates. The oil was agitated<br>
with a spatula to afford a sticky solid. The supernatant liquid was decanted from the<br>
solid into a fluted filter paper. The solid collected in the filter paper was combined with<br>
the original solid, using methanol to aid in the recovery. The resulting solution was<br>
concentrated to a dark, viscous oil. The oil was dissolved into 20% aqueous methanol<br>
containing 0.2% HBr (20 mL) and was purified by chromatography on a Biotage Flash<br>
75L equipped with a CI 8 cartridge. The fractions were analyzed by HPLC on a Luna<br><br>

PCT/US2006/020232<br><br>
-69-<br>
C18(2) column (4 x 20 mm) and the product fractions were combined and concentrated.<br>
The resulting "purified" product dissolved into DI water (approximately 20 mL) and the<br>
chromatography was repeated with the process being repeated until the purity was<br>
enhanced to approximately 70% (AUC). The approximately 70% pure product<br>
(approximately 18 g) was dissolved into DI water (20 mL) and passed through a column<br>
of AG 1-X8 anion-exchange resin converted to the bromide form (see additional<br>
procedure) (5 x 25 cm). The column was eluted with DI water until no MNTX was<br>
detectable in the eluted stream. The aqueous solution was concentrated and the residue<br>
was dissolved into DI water (10 mL), which was purified by chromatography further<br>
using the Biotage Flash 75L system equipped with a CI 8 cartridge and eluted with 5%<br>
aqueous methanol. The fractions were analyzed by HPLC on a Luna CI8(2) column(4.6<br>
x 150 mm) and the product stream was partitioned into four streams based on purity<br>
(AUC); &gt;90%, 50-90% with fast impurities. 50-90% with slow impurities, and 
The less-pure material was recycled through the chromatography to enhance the purity,<br>
which ultimately resulted in 3.0 g of S-MNTX that was 90% pure (AUC). The less-pure<br>
fractions were purified by chromatography further to provide approximately 1 g of 90%<br>
pure material, which was combined with 1.0 g of the 90% pure material previously<br>
isolated and purified by chromatography on a Biotage Flash 75L equipped with a CI8<br>
cartridge and eluted with 2.5% aqueous methanol. The chromatography was repeated to<br>
enhance the purity until &gt;95% (AUC) was achieved. At the conclusion, the product<br>
streams were lyophiiized from water to afford 741 rng of S-MNTX at 95.6% purity<br>
(AUC); 2.54 g of S-MNTX at 90% purity (AUC); and 1.08 g of S-MNTX at 79% purity<br>
(AUC).<br>

Optimization of the Synthesis and Purification of S-MNTX<br>
Preparation of the Ion-Exchange Column. AG 1-X8 Resin (Bio-Rad,<br>
analytical grade, 100-200 mesh, chloride form, 50 wt equiv) was packed into a glass<br><br>

column and was washed with 1 N HBr (approximately 100 vol, prepared with DI water).<br>
The column was washed with DI water until the eluent reached a pH of 6-7.<br>
Preparation of S-MNTX. A 250-mL, jacketed, three-neck flask was charged<br>
with oxymorphone (5.0 g, 16.6 mmol), NMP (5 mL) and copper wire (1.2 g, cut into 3-4<br>
mm pieces). The flask was wrapped in aluminurn foil and was connected to a pre-<br>
equilibrated heater/chiller set at 70 °C. Cyclopropylmethyl iodide (24.16 g, 132.7 mmol)<br>
was added to the mixture and the reaction was stirred for 20 h. Analysis of a reaction<br>
aliquot by HPLC revealed a 1:1 ratio of 2:3. The reaction mixture was transferred into<br>
an Erlenmeyer flask containing IP Ac (250 mL) that was vigorously stirred with an<br>
overhead mechanical stirrer. After the oily material solidified, the solid was filtered off<br>
and was transferred back into the flask; the filtrate was analyzed by HPLC and was<br>
discarded. The combined solid residues were dissolved in aqueous methanol and were<br>
filtered through a column of ion-exchange resin (Bio-Rad AG 1-X8, 50 wt equiv,<br>
converted to bromide form). The column was eluted with DI water and was rinsed until<br>
no UV active material was detected (254 nm\ The resulting anusous solution was<br>
concentrated and the residue was dissolved in IPA (5 vol) with a minimum amount of<br>
methanol to achieve solution. The solvent was stripped to remove traces of water and the<br>
resulting solid was dissolved in hot methanol (3 vol at approximately 50 °C). An<br>
ambient temperature mixture of methylene chloride/isopropyl alcohol (CH2CI2/IPA) (6<br>
vol/1 vol) was added and the resulting solution was allowed to stand uider anbient<br><br>
2 days. The solid was collected by filtration and afforded 2.8 g of a nearly 1:1 mixture of<br>
2 and S-MNTX. The solid was recrystallized from hot methanol (MeOH) (3 vol at<br>
approximately 50 °C) by adding CH2CI2/IPA (6 vol/1 vol), and allowing the mixture to<br>
cool. The isolated solid (2.1 g, 29% based on weight) was found to be 94.1% pure<br>
(AUC) by HPLC analysis.<br>
Purification of S-MNTX. The lots of S-MNTX of purity &gt;94% (AUC) were<br>
combined and carried through the recrystallization procedure of dissolving in hot<br>
methanol (3 vol at approximately 50 °C) and then adding a CH2C12/IPA (6 vol/1 vol)<br>
mixture. The mixture was allowed to cool to ambient temperature and the solid was<br>
collected by filtration. Four iterations were required to improve the purity of S-MNTX<br>
from 94% to &gt;99% and the overall mass recovery was 60%. In total, 8.80 g of S-MNTX<br>
were purified to 99.8%(AUC) as determined by HPLC analysis. The lR NMR, 13C<br><br>

Opiate Receptor Binding of (S)-TY-methylnaltrexone<br>
Radioligand binding assays were conducted to determine the binding specificity<br>
of S-N-metfiynaltrexone for u.-, K-, and 5-opiate receptors using methods adapted from<br>

In Vitro Pharmacology of S-MNTX: p. (mu, MOP) Receptor Bioassay<br>
Experimental Conditions. Segments of guinea pig terminal ileum were<br>
suspended in 20-ml organ baths filled with an oxygenated (95 % 02 and 5 % C02) and<br>
pre-warmed (37°C) physiological salt solution of the following composition (in rnM):<br>
NaCi 118.0, KCi 4.7, MgS04 1.2, CaCi2 2.5, KH2P04 1.2, NaHC03 25.0 and glucose<br>
11.0 (pH 7.4). Additional experimental conditions were as described in Hutchinson et al.<br>
(1975) Brit. J. Pharmacol., 55 ; 541-546.<br>
Indomethacin (1 uM), nor-binaltorphimine (0.01 pM), methysergide (1 pM),<br>
ondansetron (10 pM) and GR113808 (0.1 uM) were also present throughout the<br>
experiments to prevent prostanoid release and to block the k-opioid, 5-HT2, 5-HT3 and<br>
5-HT4 receptors, respectively. The tissues were connected to force transducers for<br>
isometric tension recordings. They were stretched to a resting tension of 1 g then allowed<br>
to equilibrate for 60 min during which time they were washed repeatedly and the tension<br>
readjusted. Thereafter, they were stimulated electrically with pulses of minimal intensity<br>
to trigger maximal contractions and 1 ms duration, delivered at 0.1 Hz by a constant<br>
current stimulator. The experiments were carried out using a semi-automated isolated<br>
organ system possessing eight organ baths, with multichannel data acquisition. .<br><br>

Experimental Protocols<br>
Test for agonist activity. The tissues were exposed to a submaximal<br>
concentration of the reference agonist DAMGO (0.1 uM) to verify responsiveness and to<br>
obtain a control response. Following extensive washings and recovery of the control<br>
twitch contractions, the tissues were exposed to increasing concentrations of S-MNTX or<br>
the same agonist. The different concentrations were added cumulatively and each was<br>
left in contact with the tissues until a stable response was obtained or for a maximum of<br>
15 min. If an agonist-like response (inhibition of twitch contractions) was obtained, the<br>
reference antagonist naloxone (0.1 uM) was tested against the highest concentration of<br>
S-MNTX to confirm the involvement of the u receptors in this response.<br>
Test for antagonist activity. The tissues were exposed to a submaximal<br>
concentration of the reference agonist DAMGO (0.1 p.M) to obtain a control response.<br>
After stabilization of the DAMGO-induced response, increasing concentrations of S-<br>
MNTX or the reference antagonist naloxone were added cumulatively. Each<br>
concentration was left in contact with the tissues until a stable response was obtained or<br>
for a maximum of 15 min. If it occurred, an inhibition of the DAMGO-induced response<br>
by S-MNTX indicated an antagonist activity at the u. receptors.<br>
Analysis and Expression of Resuits. The parameter measured was the<br>
maximum change in the amplitude of the electrically-evoked twitch contractions induced<br>
by each compound concentration. The results are expressed as a percent of the control<br>
response to DAMGO (mean values). The EC50 value (concentration producing a half-<br>
maximum response) or IC50 value (concentration causing a half-maximum inhibition of<br>
the response to DAMGO) were determined by linear regression analysis of the<br>
concentration-response curves.<br>
Results. The effects of S-MNTX investigated from 1.0E-08 M to 1.0E-04 M for<br>
agonist and antagonist activities at the u-opioid receptors in the guinea pig ileum<br>
bioassay are presented in Table IV. 1 where those of the reference compounds are also<br>
reported. The EC50 and IC50 values determined for S-MNTX are indicated in Table IV.2.<br>
In the field-stimulated guinea pig ileum, the p. receptor agonist DAMGO induced<br>
a concentration-dependent decrease in the twitch contraction amplitude which was<br>
reversed by the antagonist naloxone in a concentration-dependent manner.<br>
In the untreated tissues, S-MNTX also caused a concentration-dependent and<br><br>

naloxone-sensitive decrease in the twitch contraction amplitude.<br>
In the tissues previously depressed with DAMGO, S-MNTX did not produce any<br>
recovery of the twitch contraction amplitude but caused a further decrease.<br>
These results indicate that S-MNTX behaves as an agonist at the u.-opioid<br>
receptors in this tissue.<br>

The effect of S-N-methylnaltrexone (purity- 99.81% S-AT-methylnaltrexone; 0.19%<br>
oxymorphone; no detectable R-MNTX), as well as an authentic source of R-MNTX<br>

S-MNTX or R-MNTX was administered subcutaneously to rats<br>
(Crl:CD®(SD)BR; 5-8wks old; 180-250 gms wt) at concentrations of 1.0, 3.0, or 10.0<br>

After 15 minutes, rats were subcutaneously injected with saline (lmL/kg) or morphine (3<br>
mg/kg). A 10% suspension of activated charcoal in 0.25% methylcellulose was<br>
aobiinistered orally at 10 mL/kg to the rats 20 minutes (±2 minutes) after the<br>
subcutaneous dose of morphine or saline. The rats were euthanized 25 minutes (±3<br>
minutes) after receiving the charcoal and the intestines were removed and lightly<br>
stretched on moist paper along a meterstick. The small intestine from pyloric sphincter<br>
to caecum was measured and the distance traveled by the charcoal as a fraction of that<br>
length was evaluated for each rat.<br><br>

Values for charcoal motility were expressed as a percent effect and were<br>

percent effect was calculated using the following formula:<br><br>
Results<br>
The results from the GI transit study are shown in Table 1. Morphine, known to<br>
affect both central and peripheral opioid receptors, decreased GI motility as reported in<br>
the literature. R-MNTX, a peripherally selective mu opioid receptor antagonist, had no<br>
effect on GI transit when administered alone. R-MNTX administered prior to morphine<br>
reversed the GI slowing effect of morphine as would be expected from an opioid<br>
antagonist. The antagonist activity of R-MNTX on morphine was dose-dependent, with<br>
a partial reversal at 1 mg/kg and reversal at 3 or 10 mg/kg to the degree that GI transit<br>
was returned to values that were not statistically significantly different from the control<br>
value. In contrast to the antagonist activity of R-MNTX, S-MNTX had agonist activity<br>
when used alone, i.e. it resulted in decreased GI motility as reflected in a statistically<br>
significantly decrease in GI transit. The agonist activity of S-MNTX in decreasing GI<br>
motility was even more pronounced using S-MNTX and morphine in combination. The<br>
combination of S-MNTX + morphine had a dramatic synergistic agonist effect in<br>
decreasing GI motility to levels not observed using either compound alone. The agonist<br>
activity of S-MNTX was manifested as a slowing of GI transit when it was administered<br>
by itself and also by the increase in the inhibitory effect of morphine when the two<br>
agents were used in combination.<br>

Tests for Anti-Diarrheal Activity<br>
(a) Castor Oil Test in Rats [see, e.g., Niemegeers et al. (1972) Arzneim<br>
Forsch 22:516-518; U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,867,979; 4,990,521; 4,824,853]<br>
Rats are fasted overnight. Each animal is treated intravenously with the desired<br>
dose of the compound to be tested. One hour thereafter, the animal receives 1 ml of<br>
castor oil orally. Each animal is kept in an individual cage and about 2 hours after the<br>
castor oil treatment, each animal is assessed for the presence or absence of diarrhea. The<br>
ED50 value is determined as that dose in mg/kg body weight at which no diarrhea is<br>
present in 50% of the tested animals.<br>
For example, young female Wistar rats (230-250 g body weight) are fasted<br>
overnight and in the morning each animal is treated orally with a dose level of the<br>
compound to be tested. One hour thereafter, the animal receives 1 ml of castor oil orally.<br>
Each animal is kept in an individual cage. At different selected time intervals (e.g., 1,2,<br><br>
WO 2006/127898<br><br>
PCT/US2006/020232<br><br>
-77-<br>
3,4,6 and 8 hrs) after the castor oil treatment, the presence or absence of diarrhea is<br>
noted. In more than 95% of 500 control animals, severe diarrhea is observed 1 hour after<br>
treatment with castor oil. Using this all-or-none criterion, a significant positive effect<br>
occurs with the tested compound if no diarrhea is observed 1 hour after the castor oil<br>
treatment. A minimum of 5 dose levels are used per drug, each dose level being given to<br>
10 rats on ten different days. The ED50 value, i.e., the dose level at which such effect is<br>
observed in 50% of the animals, for the compounds, such as the compounds of formula<br>
(II), generally ranges from about 0.01 to about 10 mg/kg.<br>
(b)	Castor Oil Test in Mice [See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,326,075]<br>
Groups of mice are orally dosed with test compound and one-half hour later all<br>
mice are given 0.3 ml of castor oil. Three hours after castor oil administration, all of the<br>
mice are checked for diarrhea and the dose of testing compound which protected 50% of<br>
the mice from diarrhea is the ED50 dose,<br>
(c)	Ricinus Oil Test [See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,990,521]<br>
Rats, such as female Wistar rats or other laboratory strains, are fasted overnight.<br>
Each animal is treated orally with a dose level of the test compound. One hour<br>
thereafter, the animal is given an amount, typically 1 ml, of ricinus oil orally, each<br>
animal is kept in an individual cage and 1 hour after the ricinus oil treatment, the<br>
presence or absence of diarrhea is noted. The ED50 value is determined as that dose in<br>
mg/kg body weight at which no diarrhea is present in 50% of the treated animals.<br>
(d)	Antagonism of PGE2 -induced Diarrhea in Mice<br>
Anti-diarrheal activity can be determined by assessing the effects of a compound<br>
as an antagonist of PGE2-induced diarrhea in mice [see, e.g., Dajani et al. 1 975)<br>
European Jour. Pharmacol. 34:105-113; and Dajani et al. (1977) J. Pharmacol. Exp.<br>
Ther. 203:512-526; see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,870,084]. This method reliably elicits<br>
diarrhea in otherwise untreated mice within 15 minutes. Animals that are pretreated with<br>
the test agent in which no diarrhea occurs are considered protected by the test agent. The<br>
constipating effects of test agents are measured as an "all or none" response, and diarrhea<br>
is defined as watery unformed stools, very different from normal fecal matter, which has<br>
well-formed boluses, and is firm and relatively dry.<br>
Standard laboratory mice, such as albino mice of the Charles River CD-I strain,<br>
are used. They are typically kept in group cages. The weight range of the animals when<br>
tested is between 20-25 g. Pelleted rat chow is available ad libitum until 18 hours prior<br><br>
WO 2006/127898<br><br>
PCT/US2006/020232<br><br>
-78-<br>
to testing, at which time food is withdrawn. Animals are weighed and marked for<br>
identification. Five animals are normally used in each drug treatment group and<br>
compared with controls. Mice weighing 20-25 g are housed in group cages, and fasted<br>
overnight prior to testing. Water is available. Animals are challenged with PGE2 [0.32<br>
mg/kg i.p. in 5% ETOH] one hour after test drug treatment, and immediately placed<br>
individually, for example, in transparent acrylic boxes. A disposable cardboard sheet on<br>
the bottom of the box is checked for diarrhea on an all or nothing basis at the end of 15<br>
minutes.<br>

The total number of writhes for each mouse are recorded. The mean number of<br>
writhes for the control and each test article group are compared using an ANOVA<br>
followed by a relevant multiple comparison test and percent inhibition calculated.<br>
2.	Phenylquinone (PPQ) Writhing Assay<br>
Mice (CD-I, male) are weighed and placed in individual squares. The test or<br>
control article are administered and after the appropriate absorption time, the PPQ<br>
solution (0.02% aqueous solution) is administered intraperitoneally. Each animal is<br>
observed closely for ten minutes for exhibition of writhing.<br>
The total number of writhes for each mouse are recorded. The mean number of<br>
writhes for the control and each test article group are compared using an ANOVA<br>

Following an overnight fast, rats are placed in groups often. Twenty rats<br>
are used as vehicle controls. The rats are then sequentially injected with a 20% Brewer's<br>
yeast suspension into the plantar surface of the left hind paw. Two hours later the rats<br>
are administered the test article, reference drug, or control vehicle. One hour after dose<br>
administration, the pain threshold of the inflamed and non-inflamed paw is measured by<br>
a "Analgesia Meter" that exerts a force which increases at a constant rate along a linear<br>
scale.<br>
The control group threshold and standard deviation for the inflamed paw<br>
and non-inflamed paw are calculated. Rats in the test article group and reference group<br>
are considered protected if the individual pain threshold exceeds the control group mean<br>
threshold by two standard deviations of the means.<br>
4. Hot Plate Analgesia Assay<br>
Each mouse (CD-I, male) serves as its own control throughout the experiment.<br>
The mice are placed sequentially on a Hot Plate Analgesia Meter (set for 55°C ± 2°C).<br>
The mice react characteristically to the heat stimulus by:<br>
1.	Licking the forepaw<br>
2.	Rapid fanning of the hind paw<br>
3.	A sudden j ump off the hot plate<br>
Any of the three types of reactions are taken as an end point to the heat stimulus.<br>
The mouse is removed from the hot plate immediately upon displaying the end point.<br>
The reaction time is measured quantitatively by the number of seconds that elapse<br>
between the placing of the mouse on the hot plate and the display of a definitive end<br>
point. Elapsed time is measured by a stop watch accurate to at least 1/5 of a second.<br>
Only mice whose control reaction time is 10.0 seconds or less are used. At 15, 30, 60<br>
and 120 minutes (± 1 to 5 minutes) after test or control article adrninistration, reaction<br>
times will be obtained and recorded for the group sequentially.<br>
Analgesic response is an increase in reaction time of the mouse to the heat<br>
stimulus. Percent analgesia is calculated from the average response of the group often<br>

To evaluate the potential ability of a test article to produce an analgesic response to<br>
thermal stimulation in rats.<br>
Following an overnight fast, rats are weighed and placed in groups often. The test or<br>
vehicle control articles are administered. A Tail Flick Analgesia Meter is used. Sixty<br>
minutes following oral administration (or as recommended by the Sponsor), the tail of<br>
each rat is exposed to a specific intensity of heat stimulus and the time required to elicit a<br>
response (a characteristic tail flick) is recorded.<br>
Percent analgesia will be calculated using the mean control response compared to the<br>
mean test article response.<br>

Identification of Compounds for Use as Peripheral Anti-Hyperalgesics<br>
In general, the methods described above, are also useful for assessing peripheral<br>
anti-hyperalgesic activities of test compounds. Most preferred among the methods for<br>
assessing anti-hyperalgesic activity are those described in Niemegeers et al. (1974) Drug<br>
Res. 24:1633-1636.<br>
1.	Assessment of Ratio [C] of the ED50 Value [A] in a Test for Anti-<br>
diarrheal Activity, Such as the Castor Oil Test, to the ED50 Value [B] in a Test of CNS<br>
Effects, Such as the Tail Withdrawal Test<br>
The agents intended for use in the methods and compositions can be identified by<br>
their activity as anti-diarrheals, and their lack of CNS effects. In particular, the selected<br>
compound exhibits anti-hyperalgesic activity in any of the standard models, discussed<br>
above, and, preferably, either (a) the ratio of these activities [B/A], as measured in<br>
standard assays, is substantially greater or equal to [at least equal to, more preferably at<br>
least about 2-fold greater] than the ratio of such activities for diphenoxylate; or (b) the<br>
activity of the compound in an assay that measures CNS activity is substantially less [at<br>
least two-fold, preferably 3-fold or more] than diphenoxylate.<br>

The mu opioid receptor is G; coupled, which works by inhibiting a cAMP<br>
increase. Thus in these experiments, cellular cAMP was increased by addition of 10|xM<br>
forskolin. Prior addition of DAMGO, or similar agonists, e.g. endomorphin-1, fentanyl,<br>
or morphine, inhibited this forskolin-mduced increase. The absence of agonist effect,<br>
produced a result equivalent to forskolin alone. Therefore, increasing agonist<br>
concentration decreased cAMP levels.<br>
Antagonists, such as CTOP, naloxone and ciprodime inhibited the cAMP<br>
inhibition. Thus full antagonist effect was equivalent to forskolin without any addition<br>
of u.-opioid agonist. In these experiments, antagonist was added, then 30uM DAMGO,<br>
then forskolin. Therefore, increasing antagonist concentration increased cAMP.<br>
