METHOD FOR UTILIZING HYDROCARBON WASTE MATERIALS<br>
AS FUEL AND FEEDSTOCK<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Held of the Invention<br>
5 [0001] The present invention relates to using hydrocarbon waste materials,- more<br>
specifically, heavy petroleum hydrocarbons including petroleum sludge, tank bottoms,<br>
or residue having an API gravity of about five to about thirty into useful feels and<br>
products.<br>
2.	Background of the Invention<br>
10 [0002] Oil producers generate significant amounts of petroleum waste materials. For<br>
example, operating companies generate a significant volume of petroleum waste<br>
materials, including thousands of cubic meters of oily wastes annually, much of which<br>
are tank bottoms sludge and various refinery and production wastes. Furthermore,<br>
various amounts of non-leaded hydrocarbon products, waste solvents, and slop oil<br>
15 waste materials are generated. These waste materials are often contaminated by water<br>
and insoluble solids. Some of these sludges contain between fifty to ninety percent<br>
oil. The annual disposal costs for these materials can be a significant operating<br>
expense to operating companies, which is lost. Much of these materials are now<br>
"land-farmed" creating potential environmental problems. In the "USA and elsewhere,<br>
20 such disposal techniques are believed to have led to highly toxic superfund sites.<br>
Furthermore, local regulations are expected to limit or eliminate land farming in the<br>
near future. Therefore, it is important that proper steps are taken to utilize or dispose<br>
of such waste materials.<br>
[0003] Heavy residue, petroleum waste, and sludge materials are formed during<br>
25     production,   handling,   and processing  of the  petroleum hydrocarbons.      The<br>
transportation and use of the heavy hydrocarbons are difficult because of their high<br>
viscosity and poor stability.   At ambient conditions, heavy hydrocarbons, such as a<br><br><br>
WO 2006/039714	PCT/US2005/035827<br>
refinery residue, have an API gravity of about thirty or less. These oily materials are<br>
often contaminated with, solid or semi-solid waste materials and water.<br>
[0004] Due to improvements in the refining processes over the past fifty years,<br>
additional lighter products are "being recovered from every barrel of hydrocarbon<br>
5 waste oil. Thus, the residue and heavy materials, such as bunker fuel, being produced<br>
in various refineries are undergoing significant changes in quality including a greater<br>
concentration of asphaltenes. The presence of a larger concentration of asphaltenes in<br>
fuels has a great impact on fuel usage in various applications. Asphaltenes are polar<br>
compounds that tend to agglomerate into very large structures in liquid hydrocarbons.<br>
10 These agglomerates lead to viscosities that are much higher than if the asphaltenes<br>
were not structured. The asphaltene molecule appears to carry a core of<br>
approximately five stacked flat sheets of condensed aromatic rings, one above the<br>
other giving an overall height of sixteen to eighteen Angstroms. The average sheet<br>
diameter appears to range from six to fourteen Angstroms. The molecular weight of<br>
15 petroleum asphaltenes can range from about 1,000 to 50,000. A refinery residue after<br>
it is extracted with a solvent exists in a solid state such that its viscosity cannot be<br>
measured, and one has to heat the material at a sufficiently high temperature (&gt;100°C)<br>
to make this material into a low viscosity material suitable for transport.<br>
[0005] In storage tanks or tankers, fuel sludge, tank bottom, etc. are formed when<br>
20      asphaltenes are separated from the fuel and deposited on the bottom of the tank.<br>
Furthermore, fuel sludges are formed when different fuels including residual fuels are<br>
blended when one of the components contains significant amount of asphaltene.  In<br>
hydrocarbon waste upgraded by hydrotreating and hydrocracking processes, the<br>
relatively unreactive portion of the hydrocarbon waste, termed "residue," can be<br>
25     formed, which requires further processing.   Refinery wastes, tank bottoms sludge,<br>
waste solvents, slop oil, lube oil waste, and other hydrocarbon waste produced during<br>
refining are environmentally hazardous and can create a disposal problem.    In<br>
blending   of  different   hydrocarbon  wastes   or   hydrocarbon   waste   products,<br>
asphaltene/resin ratio is altered and fuels become unstable as asphaltenes separate and<br>
30     agglomerate.  Furthermore, as stated earlier, fuel sludges are formed when different<br><br><br>
WO 2006/039714	PCT/DS2005/035827<br>
fuels including residual fuels are blended, especially when one of the components<br>
contains higher amounts of asphaltenes. During transportation, asphaltenes deposit<br>
and clog reservoir pores and pipelines. Utilization of hydrocarbon waste involves<br>
various steps such as storage, transportation, and combustion, partial oxidation or<br>
5 further refining and the like. The presence of asphaltenes can affect each of these<br>
steps.<br>
[0006] U.S. Pat. No. 5,133,781 issued to DeRosa et al. discloses a method of<br>
stabilizing asphaltenes in hydrocarbons by dissolving the asphaltenes in<br>
tetrahydrofuran, phosphochlorinating the asphaltenes, and then reacting the<br>
10 phosphochlorinated-asphaltenes with equimolar amounts of aliphatic or aromatic<br>
alcohols. The 781 Patent stabilizes the asphaltenes for use in bituminous liquids until<br>
well into the refining process.<br>
[0007] Attempts have been made to convert sewage sludge waste into useful fuels.<br>
As an example, in U.S. Patent No. 5,356,540 issued to Khan, a pumpable aqueous<br>
15 slurry of sewage sludge is produced by the step of dewatering the sewage sludge to<br>
produce an aqueous slurry having a solids content of about 10 to 25 wt. %. The<br>
aqueous slurry of sewage sludge is then pretreated to improve its slurrying<br>
characteristics by one or a combination of (a) heating, (b) hydrothermal treatment, and<br>
(c) heating, mixing and shearing the aqueous slurry of sewage sludge. The following<br>
20 materials are then mixed together at a temperature in the range of about ambient to<br>
400° F to produce a pumpable aqueous slurry having a solids content in the range of<br>
about 30 to 65 wt. %: (a) pretreated aqueous slurry of sewage sludge; (b) a nonionic<br>
water-soluble alkoxylated alkylphenol additive; and (c) sewage sludge-containing<br>
material and/or solid carbonaceous fuel-containing material to increase the solids<br>
25 loading. When using the techniques taught by this patent with industrial hydrocarbon<br>
sludge streams, the effects are often limited in duration.<br>
[0008] Introduction into refining, partial oxidation (gasification), or combustion<br>
processes are possible avenues to dispose of petroleum hydrocarbons, such as tank<br>
bottoms sludge or residue. Having 5% by weight or greater asphaltene concentration<br><br><br>
WO 2006/039714	PCT/US2005/035827<br>
in asphaltene-rich hydrocarbons, however, tends to cause difficulties in pumping, fuel<br>
injections, atomization, spray and combustion or partial oxidation. Asphaltene rich<br>
particles have a long burning time, which results in larger flame size. Combustion<br>
ignition is delayed for these fuels. la a combustion chamber, unbumed carbon and<br>
5 soot are produced. Other difficulties include excessive wear in piston ring and<br>
cylinder liner; fracture of piston rings, and increased deposits on combustion chamber.<br>
During combustion, the presence of asphaltenes creates non-homogeneous fuel<br>
mixtures that result in a non-uniform spray pattern. Larger fuel particles containing<br>
asphaltenes do not atomize or vaporize contributing to incomplete combustion that<br>
10     leads to deposits and various pollutants being formed in the combustion system.<br>
[0009] A need exists for a method of utilizing petroleum hydrocarbon wastes that will<br>
reduce disposal costs and risks associated with disposal of the hydrocarbon wastes. A<br>
goal is to provide a process that utilizes the hydrocarbon waste as a fuel source in a<br>
process that will not result in deleterious results within the process. A further goal is<br>
15 to provide a process that efficiently utilizes the asphaltenes contained within<br>
hydrocarbon waste streams.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0010] The present invention advantageously provides a method of utilizing<br>
petroleum sludge or a hydrocarbon waste stream as a fuel source without resulting in<br>
20 deleterious results as a result of using such fuel source within the process. Costly<br>
pretreatment of the sludge or hydrocarbon waste stream, while acceptable, is not<br>
required in the present invention, which results hi a cost saving.<br>
[0011] In this process, hydrocarbon waste stream is heated and mixed with various<br>
additives at a temperature in a range of about 35° C to 90° C in the absence of air,<br>
25     while being continuously passed through a centrifuge to separate material into various<br>
fractions, namely a separated solids, an aqueous phase, and an oil phase.<br>
[0012] Each of the separated solids fraction are preferably used as a fuel source.<br>
Separated solids fraction is mixed with water to produce a pumpable slurry fuel<br><br><br>
WO 2006/039714	PCT/US2005/035827<br>
having a solids content in a range of about 50 to 60 wt. %. The water can be newly<br>
added water from an external source or a portion of aqueous phase or combinations<br>
thereof. Pumpable slurry fuel can be burned as fuel in a gasifier, furnace, boiler,<br>
incinerator, or the hike. Separated solids can also be used as an additive for asphalt.<br>
5 Oil phase is preferably used as a fuel within a refinery. A heavier aromatic portion of<br>
the oil phase can serve as a feedstock for making carbon fiber. The suitable boiling<br>
fraction that can serve as a feedstock for making carbon fiber is the between 400°C<br>
and520°C.<br>
[0013] Fuel properties of hydrocarbon waste stream having an API gravity, varying<br>
10     from about 5 to about 30 are improved by mixing the hydrocarbon waste stream with<br>
a diluent solvent sufficient to reduce the viscosity of the hydrocarbon to a range of<br>
about 250 centipoise (cP) to about 1000 cP. The mixing is preferably performed at a<br>
temperature of about 35°C to 100°C. The waste material is centrifuged, filtered, and<br>
separated into various products or fractions, namely separated solids, aqueous phase,<br>
15     and oil phase.   Separated solids contain substantial amounts of asphaltenes. Other<br>
additives can be added to hydrocarbon waste stream as described herein.<br>
[0014] In addition to the method embodiments, the apparatus useful to perform the<br>
methods described herein is also advantageous provided.<br>

10 [0018] Referring to FIG. 1, as an embodiment of the present invention, the method<br>
preferably includes the step of heating hydrocarbon waste stream 12 to a preferable<br>
preselected temperature range of between about 30 °C and about 100 °C in the<br>
absence of air. This step of heating lowers viscosity of hydrocarbon waste stream 12<br>
creating warmed hydrocarbon waste stream 16.   The step of heating hydrocarbon<br>
15 waste stream 12 more preferably includes heating hydrocarbon waste stream 12 to a<br>
heated temperature within a range of about 50°C to about 100°C.<br>
[0019] After being heated, warmed hydrocarbon waste stream 16 is then mixed with a<br>
diluent solvent stream 18a to reduce a viscosity of warmed hydrocarbon waste stream<br>
16 to a reduced viscosity. Once diluent solvent stream 18a has been added, warmed<br>
20 hydrocarbon waste stream 16 is then centrifuged to produce oil phase stream 32,<br>
aqueous phase stream 20, and separated solids stream 28, jointly called produced<br><br><br>
WO 2006/039714	PCTYUS2005/035827<br>
streams or fractions. Bach of these produced streams can be collected separately.<br>
Separated solids stream 28 contains substantial amounts of asphaltenes. Separated<br>
solids stream 28 and water are combined to produce a slurry fuel 30. The water can<br>
be newly added water from an external source 24 or a portion of aqueous phase 22 or<br>
5 combinations thereof. Slurry fuel 30 preferably has a solids content of at least 50<br>
weight percent. Slurry fuel 30 is preferably used to produce asphalt or as fuel for a<br>
gasification process. Slurry fuel 30 more preferably contains about 50 — 60 weight<br>
percent solids. Oil phase stream 32 preferably is used as a fuel source in refineries.<br>
At least a portion of oil phase 34 is preferably recycled as feed to the step of<br>
10 centrifuging warmed hydrocarbon waste stream 16. A heavier aromatic portion of the<br>
oil phase stream 32 can serve as a feedstock for making carbon fiber. The suitable<br>
boiling fraction of the portion of the oil phase stream 32 that can serve as a feedstock<br>
for making carbon fiber is the between 400°C and 520°C.<br>
[0020] The amount of diluent solvent stream 18a added to warmed hydrocarbon waste<br>
15      stream 16 can be chosen to reach a preselected viscosity of oil phase stream 32, or a .<br>
preselected concentration of asphaltenes in warmed hydrocarbon waste stream 16,<br>
based on the type of hydrocarbon waste stream 16. Alternately, the amount of diluent<br>
solvent 18a can be determined by optimizing these two factors. Amounts preferably<br>
in the range of about 0.005 to about 8 weight percent of diluent solvent stream 18a in<br>
20     warmed hydrocarbon waste stream 16 are preferred.   This advantageously provides<br>
desirable levels of stability of oil phase stream 32.   More preferably, the range is<br>
between about 0.5 to about 5.0 weight of diluent solvent stream 18a in warmedhydrocarbon waste stream 16. Even more preferably, (he range is between about 1.0<br>
to about 3.0 weight percent. With a warmed hydrocarbon waste stream 16 containing<br>
25     a large concentration of asphaltenes, the concentration of diluent solvent stream 18a is<br>
preferably up to 25 weight percent. ■<br>
[0021] Once diluent solvent stream 18ais added to wanned hydrocarbon waste stream<br>
16, a viscosity of warmed hydrocarbon waste stream 16 is reduced.   The desired or<br>
target viscosity of the oil phase stream 32 will depend on the ultimate use of oil phase<br>
30     stream 32, keeping in mind that a viscosity within the preferably range of<br>
 about 10 to<br><br><br>
"WO 2006/039714	PCT/US2005/035827<br>
about 1000 centipoise (cP), and more preferably about 200 to about 900 cP, is<br>
preferred at 25 to 70 degree C for most transportation and utilization purposes.<br>
[0022] The viscosity of heavy hydrocarbon stream having an API gravity that ranges<br>
from about 5 to about 30 is significantly reduced by exposing the hydrocarbon stream<br>
5      to a diluent solvent stream 18a, followed by separation of the produced streams as<br>
discussed above.   The combined heating and mixing of warmed hydrocarbon<br>
waste stream 16 with the diluent solvent stream 18a produces a hydrocarbon<br>
fuel comprising oil phase stream 32 that has a viscosity level that can be<br>
conveniently transported through pipelines without deposit formation.    Preferred<br>
10     pipeline viscosities range from about 400 cP to about 1000 cP.<br>
[0023] Examples of preferred diluents for transportation of hydrocarbon waste oil or<br>
refinery waste or residue to a refinery or a utilization site are lighter components of<br>
petroleum, such as gasoline, naphtha, diesel fuel, and mixtures thereof, is general, the<br>
amount of viscosity reducing additive, or diluent solvent stream 18 a, is from about 5<br>
15 weight percentage to about 50 weight percentage, and more preferably about 20<br>
weight percentage to about 35 weight percentage, of warmed hydrocarbon waste<br>
stream 16. About 20 weight percentage to 35 weight percentage of diesel, gasoline<br>
and naphtha is typically sufficient to reduce the viscosity of warmed hydrocarbon<br>
waste stream 16 to less than about 1000 cP to less than about 600 cP at 35 °C.  In<br>
20 preferred embodiments of the present invention, hydrocarbon waste stream 12 is<br>
preferably selected from the group consisting of petroleum heavy hydrocarbon waste,<br>
tank bottom, petroleum heavy fractions, bunker fuel, petroleum sludge, refinery waste,<br>
and combinations thereof.<br>
[0024] Foreign materials or contaminants, such as sand, dirt, and the like, can exist in<br>
25 hydrocarbon waste stream 12. The methods described herein optionally include the<br>
step of prefiltering hydrocarbon waste stream 12 prior to the step of heating<br>
hydrocarbon waste stream 12 to remove contaminants from hydrocarbon waste stream<br>
12. Alternately, prefiltering can occur prior to centrifugation.<br><br>
WO 2006/039714	PCT/US2005y035827<br>
[0025] la preferred embodiments of the present invention, diluent solvent stream 18a<br>
is preferably selected from the group consisting of gasoline, naphtha, kerosene, diesel<br>
fuel, and combinations thereof. Other suitable diluent solvents 18a will be apparent to<br>
those of skill hi the art and are to be considered within the scope of the present<br>
5     invention.<br>
[0026] Slurry fuel 30 produced by mixing separated solids stream 28 with at least a<br>
portion of aqueous phase 22 can be used to produce road asphalt. Slurry fuel 30 can<br>
also be made by adding an external source of water 24 to separated solids stream 28 or<br>
a combination of an external water source 24 and at least a portion, of aqueous phase<br>
10 22. An advantage of using aqueous phase stream 20 is that it reduces the disposal<br>
costs associated with disposing of aqueous phase stream 20. Slurry fuel 30 can also<br>
be used in gasification processes or combustion processes as a fuel. Separated solids<br>
stream 28 can be used as an additive in road asphalt.<br>
[0027] To improve the stability of hydrocarbon waste stream 12, an asphaltenes<br>
15     dispersing agent 18b is preferably added to warmed hydrocarbon waste stream 16.<br>
In preferred embodiments of the present invention that include adding an asphaltenes<br>
dispersing agent 18b to warmed hydrocarbon waste stream  16, asphaltenes<br>
dispersing agent 18b is preferably selected from the group consisting of toluene,<br>
xylene,   tetralin,   furan,   phenol,   ethyl   benzoate,   butaldehyde,   acetophenone,<br>
20     cyclohexanone, and combinations thereof,    Asphaltenes dispersing agent 18b is<br>
preferably added so that asphaltenes dispersing agent 18b has a concentration of about<br>
0.1 weight percent to about 25 weight percent of warmed hydrocarbon waste stream<br>
16 with dispersing agent,     In addition to improving the stability of warmed<br>
hydrocarbon waste stream 16, asphaltenes dispersing agent 18b also advantageously<br>
25     enhances the solubility of the asphaltenes, which enhances the yield of oil phase<br>
stream  32   that is  recoverable from warmed  hydrocarbon waste  stream   16.<br>
Asphaltenes dispersing agent 18b is preferably added to warmed hydrocarbon waste<br>
stream 16 using conventional methods at any time during or after centrifugation of<br>
warmed hydrocarbon waste stream 16, depending on the nature of the waste.<br><br>
WO 2006/039714	PCT/US2005/035827<br>
[0028] In preferred embodiments of the present invention, the invention includes the<br>
step of adding an emulsion breaker additive 18c to warmed hydrocarbon waste stream<br>
16 so that emulsion breaker additive 18c has a concentration of less than 100 ppm.<br>
Chemical emulsion breaker additives 18c disrupt the interfacial tensions between oil<br>
5 and water and allow droplets to coalesce and separate. Suitable emulsion breaker<br>
additives 18c for the present invention preferably include nonionic surfactants,<br>
polyglycols, polyglycol esters, ethoxylated resins, ethoxylated nonylphenols,<br>
polyhydric alcohols] sulfuric acid salts', |and combinations thereof. A preferable<br>
nonionic surfactant preferably includes a polycrylamide polymer. If oil phase stream<br>
10 32 is going to subsequently be used in oil field production, emulsion breaker additive<br>

preferably has a concentration of less than 1 weight percent of warmed hydrocarbon<br>
waste stream 16.  Filter aid 18d is preferably selected from the group consisting of<br>
20 diatomite, siliceous materials, cellulose materials, and combinations thereof.<br>
Commercial filter aids 18d are available from companies, such as Aderco Chemical<br>
Products Inc. headquartered in Quebec.<br>
[0030] The extent of fuel properties improvements made to hydrocarbon waste stream<br>
12	can be optimized based on the time/duration/type of additive and the nature and<br>
25     type of additive as well as the degree of desired separation.  The effect of viscosity<br>
reduction is retained for at least seven days.<br>
[0031] As another embodiment of the present invention, a method for utilizing a<br>
hydrocarbon waste stream having an API gravity varying from about 5 to about 30 is<br>
advantageously provided. In this embodiment, hydrocarbon waste stream 12 is heated<br><br>
10<br><br>
WO 2006/039714	PCT/US2005/035827<br>
preferably in a temperature range of about 35° C to about 100 DC in the absence of air,<br>
and more preferably in a range of about 50°C to about 90°C.<br>
[0032] Warmed hydrocarbon waste stream 16 with then mixed with a solvent 18 that<br>
is preferably selected from the group consisting of diluent solvent stream 18 a,<br>
5 asphaltenes dispersing agent 18b, emulsion breaker additive 18c, filter aid 18d, and<br>
combinations thereof. Warmed hydrocarbon waste stream 16 is then preferably<br>
centrifuged to produce oil phase stream 32, aqueous phase stream 20, and separated<br>
solids stream 28.<br>
[0033] Separated solids stream 28 and water 24 are mixed to form a slurry fuel 30 that<br>
10     has a solids content at least 50 wt%. The water can be newly added water from an<br>
external source 24 or a portion of aqueous phase 22 or combinations thereof.   Oil<br>
phase stream 32 can be used as a fuel in a refinery.  Slurry fuel 30 can be used as an<br>
additive for asphalt.   Slurry fuel 30 can also be used as fuel in combustion and<br>
gasification processes.  At least a portion of oil phase 34 can be recycled within the<br>
15    • process as a feed for the step of cenrrifuging warmed hydrocarbon waste stream 16.<br>
[0034] In addition to the method embodiments of the present invention, an apparatus<br>
embodiment is also advantageously provided, as shown in Fig. 1. In this embodiment,<br>
the apparatus 10 preferably includes a heater 14, a centrifuge 20, and a mixer 42.<br>
Heater 14 is preferably used for heating hydrocarbon waste stream 12 in the<br>
20 temperature range between about 35°C and about 100°C in the absence of air. Mixer<br>
42 is preferably used for mixing warmed hydrocarbon waste stream 16 with solvent<br>
18 that is preferably selected from the group consisting of diluent solvent stream 18a,<br>
asphaltenes dispersing agent 18b, emulsion breaker additive 18c, a filter aid 18d, and<br>
combinations thereof.   Centrifuge 20 is preferably used for centrifugmg warmed<br>
25 hydrocarbon waste stream 16 to produce oil phase stream 32, aqueous phase stream<br>
20, and separated solids stream 28.<br>
[0035] An additional mixer 44 can be provided for mixing separated solids stream 28<br>
with at least a portion of aqueous phase 22 to produce slurry fuel 30 having a solids<br><br>
11<br><br>
WO 2006/039714	PCTYUS2005/035827<br>
content at least 50 weight percent, and more preferably in the range of about 50 to<br>
about 60 weight percent.<br>
[0036] Heater 14, first mixer 42, and centrifuge 20 can be combined in a single three<br>
phase centrifuge 20. Other suitable types of equipment that can function as heater 14,<br>
5 first mixer 42, second mixer 44, and centrifuge 20 will be known to those of skill in<br>
the art and are to be considered within the scope of the present invention. For<br>
example, embodiments including a mixer-can include any device capable of mixing<br>
two or more compounds together.<br>
[0037] In preferred embodiments of the present invention, the present invention<br>
10     preferably includes a prefilter for prefiltering hydrocarbon waste stream 12 prior to<br>
heating hydrocarbon waste stream 12 to remove contaminants from hydrocarbon<br>
waste stream 12.<br>
[0038] Each of the fractions collected from the step of centrifuging warmed<br>
hydrocarbon waste stream 16 can be used in subsequent processes.  For example, a<br>
15 catalyst 40 preferably in a reactor 36 can be added to oil phase stream 32 to produce a<br>
fuel that can be used within refineries. Catalyst 40 is preferably selected from the<br>
group consisting of molybdenum, iron, cobalt, nickel, vanadium, and combinations<br>
thereof. The type of catalyst 40 that is added will depend upon the type of process in<br>
which the fuel will be used. Once added, catalyst 40 preferably has a concentration of<br>
20     less than 1 weight percent of the produced fuel.<br>
[0039] As an advantage of the present invention, the processes described herein can<br>
be used with a variety of hydrocarbon waste streams and can be controlled based upon<br>
the ultimate final use of oil phase stream 32 and slurry fuel 30. As another advantage,<br>
the processes described herein convert substantially all of hydrocarbon waste stream<br>
25 12 into useful produced streams. As a result, disposal costs normally associated with<br>
disposal of hydrocarbon waste stream 12 are virtually ehminated.<br>
[0040] Another advantage of the present invention is that the reduction of viscosity of<br>
hydrocarbon waste stream 12 lasts substantially longer than the reduction of viscosity<br><br>
12<br><br>
WO 2006/039714	PCT/PS2005/035827<br>
obtained from the application of heat alone. The reduced viscosity attained through<br>
heating alone will revert to its original viscosity after the heat has been removed from<br>
hydrocarbon waste stream 12 and it has been allowed to cool to ambient temperature.<br>
Here, the reduction in viscosity lasts substantially longer than by heating alone.<br>
5 [0041] While the invention has been shown or described in only some of its forms, it<br>
should be apparent to those skilled in the art that it is not so limited, but is susceptible<br>
to various changes without departing from the scope of the invention.<br>
[0042] For example, the centrifuging steps can be effectuated with a three-phase<br>
centrifuge, a series of centrifuges, or the like. As another example, slurry fuel 30 can<br>
10 be used for other uses besides for asphalt. Other modifications, such as adding an<br>
external source of water to make slurry fuel 30, are to be considered within the scope<br>
of the present invention. As another example, the mixers can include a pipeline that<br>
enables two or more compounds to combine.<br><br>
