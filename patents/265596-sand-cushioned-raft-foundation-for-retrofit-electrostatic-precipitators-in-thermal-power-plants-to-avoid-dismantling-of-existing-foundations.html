				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to foundations of electrostatic precipitators in<br>
thermal power plants, more particularly the invention relates to a sand<br>
cushioned raft foundation for retrofit electrostatic precipitators in thermal<br>
power plants in poor soil conditions which avoids dismantling of existing<br>
foundations.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART<br>
Electrostatic precipitator is an equipment in a thermal power plant which<br>
extracts the ash which comes along with the flue gas which is the product of<br>
burning pulverized coal in a boiler in the thermal power plant.<br>
The electrostatic precipitator uses the electrical phenomenon called "corona"<br>
discharge which under high voltage turns the flue gas into a ionized state<br>
where the negatively charged ash particles are attracted towards the positive<br>
electrodes called collecting electrodes which is rapped at intervals and<br>
collected in the ash hoppers at the bottom of the electrostatic precipitators.<br>
The weight of the collected ash and the weight of the collecting electrodes<br>
constitute the major vertical loads on the foundations of the supporting<br><br>
structure of the electrostatic precipitators apart from the wind and seismic<br>
loads.<br>
The electrostatic precipitators are designed for a particular value of<br>
permissible emission levels i.e. (the amount of dust particles present in the<br>
flue gas that is let into the atmosphere through the chimney). These emission<br>
levels are normally fixed by the pollution control boards of the Central/State<br>
Governments.<br>
The permissible emission levels had been revised at intervals and in 1980's<br>
these values were around 150mg/NM3 to around 50mg/NM3 now.<br>
The revision in the permitted emission levels require the modification to the<br>
already installed electrostatic precipitators designed for a higher emission<br>
levels to bring down the emission level to the current norms. The revision<br>
increases the vertical load on the foundation of the electrostatic precipitator<br>
as both the amount of collected ash and size of the collecting electrodes<br>
increase considerably.<br>
Most of the times the electrostatic precipitators are dismantled and newly<br>
designed bigger electrostatic precipitators are installed to satisfy the current<br>
emission norms.<br>
This process of dismantling the existing electrostatic precipitator and<br>
installing a new bigger electrostatic precipitator in the same location i.e.<br>
between the boiler and the induced draft fan is called retrofitting.<br><br>
The retrofitting of electrostatic precipitator involves the dismantling of<br>
electrostatic precipitator's and its foundations, most of the times, and the<br>
new foundations of the new electrostatic precipitator is cast in the old<br>
location designed for new loads.<br>
Dismantling of old foundation is always a laborious and time consuming work<br>
which is normally done using "jack hammers". The time taken for the<br>
dismantling of the reinforced cement concrete foundation having steel<br>
reinforcement in the concrete is more than that of plain cement concrete<br>
foundations and all the foundations of electrostatic precipitators are of<br>
reinforced cement concrete only.<br>
To avoid the dismantling of existing old foundations in a retrofitting of<br>
electrostatic precipitator the foundations are designed in such a way that the<br>
interferences of the existing foundations are avoided using different shapes of<br>
foundations other than the normal, square or rectangular foundation. The<br>
size and shape of the foundations designed is tailor made for particular<br>
location at particular site and cannot be standardized.<br>
Sometimes the existing foundations of the old electrostatic precipitators are<br>
modified to take the additional load due to the bigger new electrostatic<br>
precipitator. This is possible in some cases depending upon the locations of<br>
the old electrostatic precipitator columns with respect to the new electrostatic<br>
precipitator columns.<br>
In the prior art, at times grade beams on top of the existing foundations are<br>
used to support the new electrostatic precipitator columns if the new<br><br>
electrostatic precipitator column loads are not beyond the load carrying<br>
capacity of the old foundations.<br>
Additional columns can also be introduced if necessary to augment the load<br>
carrying capacity of the existing columns along with the grade beams if the<br>
loads from the new electrostatic precipitators are higher than the load carry<br>
capacities of the existing foundations.<br>
At times a single isolated foundation can be strengthened to take additional<br>
loads by increasing size of the base of the footing and the pedestals which<br>
support the electrostatic precipitator columns.<br>
These modifications always involve chipping of concrete using jack hammers,<br>
welding of reinforcement, providing additional concrete and application of<br>
bonding agent which is also a time consuming job which takes about the<br>
same time which is required for the dismantling of the old foundation.<br>
The modifications of existing foundations or strengthening of the existing<br>
foundation to carry additional loads can be done only in cases where the<br>
existing concrete is of the grade which is permitted by the new Indian<br>
Standards (IS-456-2000). For example the earlier codes permitted M-15<br>
grade for Reinforced cement concrete foundation in 1980's and M-25 is the<br>
minimum grade of concrete that can be used in foundations at present as per<br>
IS-456-2000.<br>
Since the retrofitting of electrostatic precipitators are normally done after<br>
about 20 years, the grade of concrete in the existing foundation will be<br>
normally lower than the grade permitted in the present Indian Standards (IS-<br><br>
456-2000). This warrants the retrofit electrostatic precipitators are to be<br>
provided with new foundations.<br>
The new foundations of the electrostatic precipitators are normally designed<br>
as simple isolated foundations where the soil conditions are very good. Pile<br>
foundations are provided in places where the soil conditions are very bad.<br>
Pile foundations are special foundations cast in to the holes drilled into the<br>
earth for about 10 to 25m, with special machinery for drilling and casting of<br>
reinforced cement concrete piles.<br>
The present invention provides a novel alternative which is the raft or mat<br>
foundation interconnecting all the columns of a new electrostatic precipitator<br>
unlike the other two type of foundation namely isolated foundations and pile<br>
foundations where the foundations are provided for a single column.<br>
The raft foundations are normally used in poor soil conditions. They are<br>
comparatively cheaper than the pile foundations in a poor soil condition but<br>
can be cast using conventional concreting equipment unlike pile foundation<br>
which needs special machinery for drilling and casting.<br>
The bearing capacity of the soil of a raft foundation in almost double than<br>
that of the isolated foundations for the same soil type and settlements are<br>
also almost 50% less than that of the isolated foundations.<br>
Because space availability in a retrofit electrostatic precipitator site is always<br>
critical since the old electrostatic precipitator is always replaced with a bigger<br>
electrostatic precipitator and the original layout of machines are not designed<br><br>
for future expansion, the raft foundation is ideal because raft foundation<br>
occupies the minimum foot print.<br>
The present invention seeks to overcome the drawbacks of the prior art.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION:<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a sand cushioned raft<br>
foundation for the retrofit Electrostatic Precipitators in thermal power plants<br>
which avoids the dismantling of the existing foundation footings.<br>
Another object of the invention to provide sand cushioned Raft Foundation<br>
for Retrofit Electrostatic Precipitators adapted to thermal Power Plant which is<br>
cheaper and requires less time to execute than dismantling the existing<br>
foundations and making a new foundation.<br>
Another object of the invention to provide sand cushioned raft foundation for<br>
retrofit electrostatic precipitator which has an increased bearing capacity than<br>
that of a normal isolated foundation.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide sand cushioned raft<br>
foundation for retrofit electrostatic precipitator in thermal power plants which<br>
have less settlement for the same soil condition and loads compared to<br>
normal isolated foundations.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide a sand cushioned raft<br>
foundation for retrofit electrostatic precipitator in thermal power plants which<br>
does not need any special equipment to cast the foundations like in the case<br>
of pile foundations.<br><br>
A still further object of the invention is to provide sand cushioned raft<br>
foundation for retrofit electrostatic precipitator in thermal power plants, to<br>
reduce the footprint required for the foundation.<br>
A still further object of the invention is to provide sand cushioned raft<br>
foundation for retrofit electrostatic precipitator in thermal power plants, in<br>
which fly ash, a recycled material can be used instead of sand for the back<br>
fill. Fly ash is an environmentally 'green' material.<br>
A still further object of the invention is to provide a one meter cantilever from<br>
the edge of the pedestals to reduce the pressure on the sand cushion.<br>
A still further object of the invention is to provide a bigger than normal size of<br>
pedestals to reduce the punching shear capacity of the raft foundations.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION:<br>
According to the invention, the sand cushioned raft foundation for<br>
electrostatic precipitator is cast about one meter above the existing<br>
foundation footing top level.<br>
Sand is used as a back filling material between the existing foundation and<br>
the new raft foundation which acts as a cushion.<br>
The pedestals of the existing foundation alone are removed from the footing<br>
by chipping along the edges to expose the reinforcements and after cutting<br>
the exposed reinforcements along the periphery of the pedestal bottom, the<br>
pedestal is pushed down using a hydraulic crane and removed from site.<br><br>
Excavation is done initially up to the bottom of existing foundations and<br>
entire originally backfilled material is removed before sand filling.<br>
Good coarse river sand is used for backfilling .<br>
The bearing capacity of the sand used for backfilling is always higher than the<br>
bearing pressure of the raft foundation, which is always low because of the<br>
large area of the raft foundation.<br>
The soil cushion avoids the increased local stresses which the new raft<br>
foundation will be subjected to if the new foundation is put on top of the old<br>
foundation without soil cushion.<br>
Murram /fly ash/quarry dust/plain cement concrete can also be used<br>
effectively as the backfilling material instead of sand according to the<br>
availability of the material locally at cheaper cost.<br>
The raft foundation with soil cushion avoids dismantling of footings of the old<br>
existing foundations which involves both time and money.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWING:<br>
Fig.l. shows the sectional elevation of the sand cushioned raft foundation for<br>
retrofit electrostatic precipitator in thermal power plants, according to the<br>
invention.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
A raft foundation (1) for a retrofit electrostatic precipitator in thermal power<br>
plants exerts very low pressure on the soil because of its vast area as the<br>
foundation interconnects all the columns of an electrostatic precipitator.<br>
According to the invention the material for the sand cushion (2) used for<br>
backfilling can also murram/ fly ash/ quarry dust/ plain cement concrete,<br>
according to the availability of the material at lower cost. The thickness of the<br>
sand cushion (2) is at least lm to avoid local stresses on the raft due to the<br>
existing foundation below.<br>
The raft foundation (1) foot print is the lowest among other types of<br>
foundation used in retrofit electrostatic precipitator foundations, namely<br>
isolated and pile foundation.<br>
Because of the large area of the raft, the settlement of foundation is lower<br>
than that of the normal isolated foundations.<br>
The old pedestals (3) of the existing foundation alone are removed by<br>
chipping the edges along the periphery at the bottom of the pedestal (3) and<br>
pushing the pedestals (3) down with hydraulic crane.<br>
The footings (4) of the old foundations are not dismantled and the sand<br>
cushion is provided above the footings.<br>
The sand cushioned raft foundation (1) considerably reduces the unequal<br>
settlements of the foundation compared to normal isolated foundations.<br><br>
The sand cushion (2) distributes the pressure uniformly to the soil below and<br>
to the footing of the existing foundation.<br>
The raft foundation can be designed as a flexible foundation using available<br>
software because of the soil cushion.<br>
The raft foundation (1) according to the invention has very low bearing<br>
pressure in the range of 6 to 10 T/m2. This raft foundation (1) is provided<br>
with a cantilever(5) which is lm long, from the outer pedestals(6) to reduce<br>
the corner and edge stresses. The cantilever (5) also reduces the bearing<br>
pressure by 15-20%.<br>
The pedestals (6) which rest over the raft foundation (1) support the columns<br>
of the retrofit electrostatic precipitation. These pedestals (6) are provided in<br>
size of 1.2m x 1.2m against lm x lm in prior art, to reduce therein punching<br>
shear stress.<br>
The sand cushioned raft foundation (1) can be used for all retrofit<br>
electrostatic precipitators irrespective of the size and in any soil condition.<br><br>
