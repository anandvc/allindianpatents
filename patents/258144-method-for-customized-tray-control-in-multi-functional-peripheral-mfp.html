				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention, in general, relates to the field of Multi Functional peripherals (MFP) and in specifically relates to the Control Tray and Output Tray Control in MFP. More particularly, this invention relates to a method for customized tray control in MFP.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
In order to comprehend the current state of this technology, United States Patent bearing number 5,157,448 entitled "Automatic copier or printer paper tray lock" is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The said patent describes a reproduction machine paper loading drawer interlock system which provides protection from jams by preventing drawer opening during sheet feeding there from, yet provides more frequent and/or rapid drawer access for copy paper loading, particularly desirable for loading one drawer while running the machine and feeding sheets from another drawer, by independently operating each paper drawer interlock from the existing wiring and electrical signals for the paper feeder drive for that drawer, without any wiring or unique software requirements from the machine controller, or requiring any machine "cycle out" signals there from, or actuation of any manually actuated unlocking switches.<br><br>
Figure 1 illustrates the related art. Mostly in Network based MFP where the user would have to print any kind of data including confidential data, the user has to be near the printer until the document is printed.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention proposed herein describes an MFP, which includes a covered output tray which can be remotely controlled together with a locking mechanism for the output tray.<br>
Generally, in a network printer all the output documents come and fall on the same output tray. In case any personal or confidential document is printed, the printed document needs to be secured for a specific time so that the user can come and collect the same.<br>
The invention is to have a covered output tray and a locking mechanism for the same so that the output tray lock can be controlled in a customized way, by allowing the user to lock the output tray once the printing job starts and till it ends. Once the print job is over the user is informed about the end of job in order that the user may collect the same. The tray lock is automatically unlocked after the print job is over.<br>
Also, in case of receiving FAX, if the FAX is configured as secure FAX, the Document output is locked before the fax documents are printed and unlocked<br><br>
after the end of printing so that the user need not be worried about the loss of document or wait in close proximity for monitoring while all fax documents are printed. In case of receiving FAX the user may be sent a message on the end of fax printing so that the user may collect the same.<br>
The output Tray Locking can be customized that in case of FAX the user can override the request to lock the door in case if he feels that is not needed.<br>
The user can go and collect the documents once the document is printed. The user need not wait and secure till all documents are printed.<br>
The primary advantage of the proposed invention is that the user need not manually wait near the MFP till the documents are printed.<br>
Accordingly, this invention explains a method for customized tray control in MFP comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	receiving a print job over network;<br>
(b)	checking the source of the job by the MFP;<br>
(c)	checking whether the Output tray lock option flag is set to true;<br>
(d)	locking the output tray by the MFP before processing the job if Output Tray lock option Flag is true;<br>
(e)	processing the job by MFP and sending the Job end message to user if the said flag is set to false;<br>
(f)	initializing the timing counter and sending a message to User after the job<br><br>
processing is over; (g) periodically checking whether the timer is elapsed; and (h) opening the Tray and sending message to the user if the said time is<br>
elapsed.<br>
The said step of waiting continues till the said time is elapsed and while waiting if user enters password, the password is validated and if the password matches the tray is opened prompting user to enter password again. If password matches the tray is opened and the timing counter is cleared. If any error encountered in locking the output tray occurs which needs manual intervention the MFP sends an error message to the user. The lock unlocks itself after a pre-defined time set after the print job is over, or based on a password entered by the user to authenticate the user for unlocking the output tray. In FAX reception, if the FAX is configured as secure FAX then the document output is locked before the fax documents are printed and unlocked after the end of printing.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>

Figure 3 is a flow diagram illustrating the working of an embodiment of the proposed method.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
The invention described hereinunder describes an MFP, which includes a covered output tray which can be remotely controlled together with a locking mechanism for the output tray. Figure 2 illustrates a Sample Model of MFP with Door and Lock Mechanism for securing documents.<br><br>
As in illustrative example of the Printing job given in figure 3 may be explained as<br>
below:<br>
Steps:<br>
1)	The Print job is received over Network (1).<br>
2)	The MFP checks the user from whom the job has come and checks whether he has set the Output Tary lock option flag to true (2).<br>
3)	If Flag is true then the MFP tries to lock the output tray before processing the job. If any error encountered in locking the output tray (3) which needs manual intervention the MFP sends an error message to user (3a)., else. Go to step 5.<br>
4)	If flag is set to false then MFP process the job and send the Job end message to user (4a).<br>
5)	Process the Job and after the job processing is over initialise the timing counter and send a message to User (4).<br>
6)	Periodically check whether the timer is elapsed (7) if elapsed Open the Tray and send Message to USER (8), else continue to wait.<br>
7)	While waiting if user enters password, validate password, if password matches open tray or prompt user to enter password again.<br>
8)	If Password Matches (6) open tray and clear Timing Counter (9).<br>
Steps on receipt of a print Job:<br>
Parse Data and Initialize Printer settings, such as selecting paper type, Emulation etc. These are done based on the standard PJL that will be present in the data stream. In similar way the data is parsed to find whether the option to<br><br>
lock the Output Tray is sent. This will be sent in a standard way using PJL command as follows. @PJL SET LOCKOUTPUTTRAY=TRUE. This will set the LOCKOUTPUTTRAY to TRUE for the current Print Job.<br>
Once this is set TRUE then the Printer sends a command "LOCK" to the standard Locking Mechanism Interface provided. The Interface will send appropriate command/set flag as required by the Locking Mechanism so that the LOCK is applied.<br>
The MFP processes the print Job and once it completes, a countdown timer is initiated for a specified time out. MFP also sends Job End message to user, so that the user can come to the MFP and on Validation can UNLOCK and collect the documents. E.g. "<user name> Printing Complete: Output Tray Will UNLOCK in 90 seconds".<br>
The User can enter the Password through the standard Ul (User Interface) provided and MFP validates the Password. If Password Matches the MFP send UNLOCK command through the Standard Interface to the Locking Mechanism. The Locking Unit Unlocks the Lock and the User can collect the printed documents.<br>
If the User fails to enter Password with in the time the timer gets elapsed the MFP automatically send the UNLOCK command. This is done so that the MFP doesn't LOCK the output tray forever.<br><br>
The User can also set the Timeout Option when he sets the LOCKOUTPUTTRAY. This is done by sending the PJL as below. @PJL SET LOCKOUTPUTTRAYTIMEOUT=<x in sec>. The time out seconds can range from 1 to 180. If value is less than 1 them its set as 1, and values greater than 180 will be set to 180.<br>
By default the LOCKOUTPUTTRAY is False if that is not set to TRUE and printer doesn't LOCK the output tray. Hence the Timing information in the JOB END message is also not sent after Printing JOB is complete.<br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a microchip, microprocessor, handheld communication device, computer, rendering device or a multi function device.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by<br><br>
the appended claims unless they depart therefrom.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
