				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a mobile terminal and, more particularly,<br>
to a hinge unit capable of suitably adjusting force required for a user to open and<br>
close a mobile phone body as necessary, and a mobile terminal having the hinge<br>
unit.<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
Figure 1 is a perspective view of a mobile terminal in accordance with a<br>
related art, Figure 2 is an exploded perspective view of a hinge unit of the mobile<br>
terminal in accordance with the related art, and Figure 3 is a sectional view of the<br>
hinge unit in accordance with the related art.<br>
The related art mobile terminal includes: a second body 110 having<br>
various circuit components therein, a key pad 102 formed at its front surface to<br>
allow a user to input information, and a battery 106 mounted at its rear surface; a<br>
first body 120 rotatably connected with the second body 110 and having an LCD<br>
116 for displaying information desired by a user; hinge connection parts 112 and<br>
114 formed between the second body 110 and the first body 120 and rotatably<br>
connecting the second body 110 and the first body 120; and a hinge unit 122<br>
installed in the hinge connection parts 112 and 114 and generating a torque when<br>
the first body 120 is opened and closed.<br>
The hinge unit 122 includes a housing 130 fixed at the hinge connection<br>
part 114 of the first body 120 and having a space therein, a moving cam 132<br>
mounted to be linearly moved in the housing 130; a fixed cam 134 disposed to<br>
contact with the moving cam 132; a head 136 having the fixed cam 134 mounted<br>
t.hereon and fixed to the hinge connection part 112; and a spring 138 disposed<br>
inside the housing 130 and applying certain elastic force to the moving cam 132.<br>
The operation of the hinge unit of the related art mobile terminal will now<br>
be described.<br>
When the first body 120 is rotated in an opened direction to open the first<br>
body 120, the housing 130 fixed at the hinge connection part 114 of the first body<br>
120 and the head 136 fixed at the hinge connection part 112 of the second body<br>
110 are relatively rotated.<br>
Then, the fixed cam 134 fixed at the head 136 is rotatably moved, and<br>
accordingly, the fixed cam 134 is rotated along the moving cam 132, to thereby<br>
linearly move the moving cam 132. At this time, the spring 138 supported by the<br>
moving cam 132 is compressed to apply an elastic force to the moving cam 132 to<br>
generate torque when the first body 120 is opened and closed.<br>
However, the related art mobile terminal has the following problem. That<br>
is, since the spring of the hinge unit has the uniform elastic force, it has the same<br>
torque. Thus, the user must use the same amount of force to open or close the<br>
first body, a problem arises in that the force applied for opening and closing the<br>
first body cannot be controlled in spite of a personal difference of the force.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a mobile<br><br>
terminal for allowing a user to control force for opening and closing a first body<br>
according to a condition of the user by controlling torque of a hinge unit.<br>
To achieve these and other advantages and in accordance with the<br>
purpose of the present invention, as embodied and broadly described herein,<br>
there is provided a mobile terminal including: a second body; a first body rotatably<br>
connected with the second body; a hinge connection part rotatably connecting the<br>
second body and the first body; and a hinge unit mounted at the hinge connection<br>
part and controlling torque applied to the first body when the first body is opened<br>
and closed.<br>
The hinge unit includes: a housing fixed at one of the first body and the<br>
second body and having a space therein; a moving cam mounted to be linearly<br>
moved in the housing; a fixed cam disposed to contact with the moving cam and<br>
rotatably disposed inside the housing; a head having the fixed cam mounted<br>
thereon and fixed to the other remaining one of the second body and the first<br>
body; a spring disposed inside the housing and applying elastic force to the<br>
moving cam; and a torque controller mounted inside the housing and controlling<br>
torque in opening and closing the first body by varying tensile force of a spring<br>
applied to the moving cam.<br>
The torque controller includes: a support plate disposed to be movable<br>
inside the housing and supporting the spring; and a control bolt threaded with the<br>
support plate and linearly moving the support plate according to user's<br>
manipulation.<br>
The hinge unit in accordance with the present invention includes a<br>

Figure 4 is a perspective view of a mobile terminal in accordance with the<br>
present invention.<br>
The mobile terminal in accordance with the present invention includes: a<br>
second body 10 having a PCB with various circuit components mounted thereon<br>
and a key pad 102 formed at its front surface to allow a user to input information;<br>
a first body 20 rotatably connected with the second body 10 and having an LCD<br>
22 for displaying information desired by a user; hinge connection parts 14 and 16<br>
formed between the second body 10 and the first body 20 and rotatably<br>
connecting the second body 10 and the first body 20; and a hinge unit 30 installed<br>
at the hinge connection parts 14 and 16, generating a torque when the first body<br>
20 is opened and closed, and allowing the user to control torque.<br>
Figure 5 is an exploded perspective view of the mobile terminal in<br>
accordance with the present invention, and Figure 6 is a sectional view of the<br>
hinge unit in accordance with the present invention.<br>
The hinge unit 30 includes: a housing 32 fixed at one of the hinge<br>
connection parts 14 and 16 of the first body 20 and the second body 10 and<br>
ihaving a space therein, a moving cam 36 mounted to be linearly moved in the<br>
housing 32; a fixed cam 38 disposed to contact with the moving cam 36 and<br>
rotatably disposed inside the housing 32; a head 40 having the fixed cam 38<br>
mounted thereon and fixed to the other remaining one of the hinge connection<br>
parts 14 and 16 of the second body 10 and the first body 20; a spring 42 disposed<br>
inside the housing 32 and applying elastic force to the moving cam 36; and a<br>
torque controller 44 mounted inside the housing 32 and controlling torque in<br>
opening and closing the first body 20 by varying tensile force of a spring 42<br>
applied to the moving cam 36.<br>
The housing 32 is formed in a polygonal shape with both sides thereof<br>
opened, and a cover 34 is inserted to one side thereof. The cover 34 is fixedly<br>
nserted at an outer circumferential surface of the housing 32 and has a through<br>
hole 56 through which the torque controller 44 is exposed.<br>
The housing 32 includes a plurality of stopping holes 48 in a<br>
circumferential direction, and stopping hooks 50 are formed in the circumferential<br>
direction and bent in an inward direction and caught by the stopping holes 48.<br>
Namely, when the cover 34 is inserted at the outer circumferential surface of the<br>
housing 32, the stopping hooks 50 of the cover 34 are caught at the stopping<br>
holes 48 of the housing 32, thereby locking the housing 32 and the cover 34.<br>
Herein, when the housing 32 is fixed at the hinge connection part 16 of<br>
the first body 20, the head 40 is fixed to the hinge connection part 14 of the<br>
second body 10, and when the housing 32 is fixed at the hinge connection unit 14<br>
of the second body 10, the head 40 is fixed to the hinge connection part 16.<br>
The moving cam 36 is disposed to be linearly moved inside the housing<br>
32 and its outer circumference is formed in the same polygonal shape as the<br>
housing 32 so that the moving cam 36 cannot be rotated. A first cam face 52 is<br>
formed at one side of the moving cam 36 and the other side of the moving cam 36<br>
supports one end portion of the spring 42.<br>
The fixed cam 38 has a circular outer circumference so as to be rotatably<br>
disposed inside the housing 32. A second cam face 54 is formed at one side<br>
thereof and contacts with a first cam face 52 of the moving cam 36, and a fixing<br>
part 58 to be inserted into a fixing hole 56 formed at the head 40 is formed at the<br>
other side of the fixed cam 38.<br>
A cam shaft 60 is formed in a longitudinal direction at the fixed cam 38,<br>
and the moving cam 36 is inserted to be linearly movable into the cam shaft 60 go<br>
guide linear movement of the moving cam 36.<br>
The torque controller 44 includes a support plate 62 having the same<br>
polygonal outer circumference as an inner circumference of the housing 32 so as<br>
to be linearly moved into the inner circumference of the housing 32, the other side<br>
of the spring 42 being supported by one side of the support plate 62, a control bolt<br>
64 threaded with the support plate 62 in order to linearly move the support plate<br>
62, and disposed such that one end portion of the control bolt is exposed through<br>
the through hole 56 formed at the cover 34; and a support spring 66 installed<br>
between inner wall faces of the support plate 62 and the housing 32 and<br>
preventing the support plate 62 from being inclined when being moved.<br>
The outer circumference of the support plate 62 is formed as a plate type<br>
in a polygonal shape, and a female screw 70 into which a male screw 68 of the<br>
control bolt 64 is threaded is formed at the center of the support plate 62. One<br>
side of the support plate 62 supports spring 42 and the other side supports the<br>
support spring 66, so that when the control bolt 64 is rotated, it is linearly moved<br>
inside the housing 32 to control tensile force of the spring 42.<br>
As shown in Figure 7, the male screw 68 to be threaded with the female<br>
screw 70 of the control bolt 64 is formed at one circumferential surface of the<br>
control bolt 64, and a tool insertion hole 74 is formed at the other end portion, into<br>
which a tool for rotating the control bolt 64 is inserted.<br>
The control bolt 64 is rotatably mounted at the through hole of the cover<br>
and its linear movement is prevented. Namely, a support 72 is formed at one side<br>
of the control bolt 64 and extended in an outward direction so as to be supported<br>
at an inner side of the cover 34, and a groove 76 is formed in a circumferential<br>
direction at a portion positioned at an outer surface of the cover 34, in which a<br>
snap ring 78 is mounted.<br>
Supported by the support 72 and the snap ring 78 at an inner side and at<br>
an outer side of the cover 34, the control bolt 64 can make a rotational movement<br>
but not a linear movement.<br>
The snap ring 80 is mounted at the end portion of the control bolt 64 in<br>
order to prevent the control bolt 64 from being released fro the support plate 62.<br>
One end of the support spring 66 is supported by the support plate 62 and<br>
the other end thereof is supported by the inner circumference of the cover 34,<br>
allowing certain elastic force to the support plate 62 to thereby prevent inclination<br>
or distortion of the support plate 62 when the support plate 62 is linearly moved.<br>
The operation of the mobile terminal constructed as described above will<br>
be explained as follows.<br>
Figures 8 and 9 show operational state of the hinge unit in accordance<br>
with the present invention.<br>
When a user rotates the control bolt 64 clockwise by using a tool, the<br>
support plate 62 threaded with the control bolt 64 is linearly moved in a forward<br>
direction, shortening the length (L1) of a free field of the spring 42. Accordingly, a<br>
tensile force of the spring 42 increases. The support plate 62 is supported by the<br>
support spring 66 so that the support plate 62 cannot be inclined or distorted<br>
when being linearly moved.<br>
Conversely, if the user rotates the control bolt 64 counterclockwise, the<br>
support plate 62 threaded with the control bolt 64 is linearly moved in a backward<br>
direction. Then, a length (L2) of the free field of the spring 42 is lengthened and<br>
the tensile force of the spring 42 is reduced.<br>
In this manner, the user can vary the tensile force of the spring 42 by<br>
controlling the length of the free field of the spring 42 by rotating the control bolt<br>
64 clockwise or counterclockwise. And accordingly, force working between the first<br>
can face 52 of the moving cam 36 and the second cam face 54 of the fixed cam<br>
38 differs, so that the user can control force applied for opening and closing the<br>
first body 20.<br>
As so far described, the mobile terminal in accordance with the present<br>
invention has the following advantage.<br>
That is, for example, by installing the torque controller at the hinge unit,<br>
the user can control force for opening and closing the first body by directly<br>
controlling torque of the hinge unit. Thus, the user can conveniently use the<br>
mobile phone.<br>
As the present invention may be embodied in several forms without<br>
departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof, it should also be<br>
understood that the above-described embodiments are not limited by any of the<br>
details of the foregoing description, unless otherwise specified, but rather should<br>
