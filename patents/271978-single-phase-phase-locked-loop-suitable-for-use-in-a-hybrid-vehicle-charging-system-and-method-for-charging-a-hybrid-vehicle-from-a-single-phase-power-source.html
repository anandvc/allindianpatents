				<td>SINGLE-PHASE PHASE LOCKED LOOP SUITABLE FOR USE IN A<br>
HYBRID VEHICLE CHARGING SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR<br>
CHARGING A HYBRID VEHICLE FROM A SINGLE-PHASE POWER<br>
SOURCE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]      The present invention generally relates to electric and hybrid<br>
vehicles and more particularly relates to charging systems for electric and<br>
hybrid vehicles and more specifically relates to a single-phase phase locked<br>
loop suitable for use in an electric or hybrid vehicle charging system.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Contemporary commercially available hybrid vehicles are<br>
generally of the dual-mode type having a liquid fueled (gas) powered engine<br>
that drives a generator for charging a battery array. The battery array powers<br>
one or more electric motors that propel the vehicle using direct current (DC)<br>
power alone or in cooperation with the gas engine.<br>
[0003] A potential alternate or supplemental charging source for the<br>
battery array of a hybrid vehicle is to "plug in" the vehicle to a public or<br>
private utility company power grid. This can be done in a driveway, a garage<br>
or in a public parking structure. However, to properly charge the battery<br>
array, the charging power waveform must be phase locked to the incoming<br>
power grid voltage. This can be done for commercial 3-phase (or multi-phase)<br>
power signals, however, most home power arrangements do not have 3-phase<br>
power systems available and most home owners will not undergo the expense<br>
to install them just to charge a hybrid vehicle.<br>
[0004] Accordingly, it is desirable to provide a single-phase charging<br>
arrangement for a hybrid vehicle so that a hybrid vehicle can be charged from<br>
a home line current. Furthermore, other desirable features and characteristics<br>
 <br>
of the present invention will become apparent from the subsequent detailed<br>
description and the appended claims, taken in conjunction with the<br>
accompanying drawings and the foregoing technical field and background.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005] In one embodiment, a charging system for a hybrid vehicle<br>
includes a single-phase phase locked loop (PLL) coupled to a standard (110<br>
volt, 60 Hz in the United States) power grid voltage. The incoming phase<br>
voltage is delayed one quarter cycle to create an imaginary phase, which is<br>
orthogonal to the power grid voltage and considered as a second phase signal<br>
for the PLL. By applying a transform matrix (discussed below), the present<br>
invention is able to phase lock to a single-phase power grid voltage and<br>
efficiently and safely charge a hybrid vehicle.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF AN EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT<br>
[0015] As used herein, the word "exemplary" means "serving as an<br>
example, instance, or illustration." The following detailed description is<br>
merely exemplary in nature and is not intended to limit the invention or the<br>
application and uses of the invention. Any embodiment described herein as<br>
"exemplary" is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous<br>
over other embodiments. All of the embodiments described in this Detailed<br>
Description are exemplary embodiments provided to enable persons skilled in<br>
the art to make or use the invention and not to limit the scope of the invention<br>
which is defined by the claims. Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound<br>
by any expressed or implied theory presented in the preceding technical field,<br>
background, brief summary or the following detailed description.<br>
[0016] Referring now to FIG. 1A, a hybrid vehicle 2 is shown which<br>
employs the single-phase phase locked loop (PLL) charging system of the<br>
present invention. According to the present invention, the hybrid vehicle 2<br>
can have an internal battery array charged by being electrically coupled via a<br>
cable 4 to a public or private utility power grid (not shown). In this way, the<br>
present invention affords the advantage of being able to charge the battery<br>
array of the hybrid vehicle without operating the vehicle or consuming fuel<br>
(gas).<br>
[0017]       In this regard, any of the concepts disclosed here can be applied<br>
generally to "vehicles," and as used herein, the term "vehicle" broadly refers<br>
 <br>
to a non-living transport mechanism. Examples of such vehicles include<br>
automobiles such as buses, cars, trucks, sport utility vehicles, vans, vehicles<br>
that do not travel on land such as mechanical water vehicles including<br>
watercraft, hovercraft, boats and ships, and mechanical rail vehicles such as<br>
trains, trams and trolleys, etc. In addition, the term "gas engine" is not limited<br>
by any specific propulsion technology such as gasoline or diesel fuel. Rather,<br>
gas engine also include hydrogen vehicles, ethanol vehicles and vehicles<br>
which operate using various other alternative fuels.<br>
[0018] Referring now to FIG. 1B, a chassis 6 of the hybrid vehicle 2 is<br>
shown along with major drive train components. Generally, contemporary<br>
hybrid vehicles have a battery array 8 (typically a 300 volt battery array for a<br>
standard sized automobile) and a gas engine 10. Alternately, the present<br>
invention could be used with an entirely direct current (DC) propulsion system<br>
(i.e., a vehicle without a gas engine). For electric (DC) power, an electric<br>
motor 9 (more than one can be used) provides front-wheel drive propulsion for<br>
the hybrid vehicle 2. In on embodiment, the electric motor 9 is powered by<br>
alternating current (AC) generated by a switching circuit as is known in the<br>
art. Alternately, the electric motor 9 can be a DC motor powered directly from<br>
the battery array 8.<br>
[0019] In one embodiment, the gas engine 10 drives a generator 12, which<br>
can recharge the battery array 8 when required while the vehicle is operating.<br>
A dual-mode transmission 14 allows the gas engine to provide rear-wheel<br>
propulsion via a drive shaft 16 and a differential 18. As discussed in<br>
conjunction with FIG. 1A, battery array 8 charging circuitry 20 is coupled to a<br>
power grid voltage via cable 4. Thus, the present invention affords the<br>
opportunity for the hybrid vehicle 2 to be charged from a standard (single-<br>
phase, 110 volts, 60 Hz in the U.S.) power grid voltage available generally in<br>
homes and businesses.<br>
[0020] Referring now to FIG. 2, the single-phase phased locked loop<br>
(PLL) 22 in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is<br>
shown in block diagram form. The single-phase power grid voltage 24 (Va) is<br>
 <br>
delayed (26) preferably by one-quarter cycle and the phase delayed signal 28<br>
(Vb) is applied to a transform matrix 30. The phase delayed signal 28 is<br>
orthogonal to the power grid voltage 24 and can be used as an imaginary<br>
second phase signal for phase locking purposes as will be explained below.<br>
The transform matrix 30 produces Vd 32 and Vq 34 and Vq is multiplied by a<br>
gain factor (1/Vm) where:<br>
 <br>
[0023] Referring now to FIG. 3A and FIG. 3B, an illustration of how the<br>
transformation matrix 30 modifies Va and Vb to create Vd and Vq in<br>
accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. As can be seen,<br>
Vd (/d) is phase shifted (9 31) from Va (/a) and Vq (/q) is phase shifted from<br>
Vb (fb) as follows:<br>
 <br>
[0027] Equation 5 demonstrates that the phase difference can be reduced<br>
to zero by using the transform matrix 30 along with phase lock elements 32,<br>
loop filter 34 and integrator (1/S) 36 such that an output signal 38 can be<br>
phased locked to the power grid voltage 24.<br>
[0028] Referring now to FIG. 4, a charging control system 40 is shown in<br>
block diagram form. The charging control system 40 includes the single-<br>
phase PLL 22 of FIG. 2 and operates to afford the present invention an<br>
alternative or supplemental charging ability for the battery array 8 of the<br>
hybrid vehicle 2. As shown in FIG. 4, a DC power source 42 (which in one<br>
embodiment can be the battery array 8 of FIB. 1B) is coupled by an H-Bridge<br>
 <br>
circuit 44 to a public or private utility company 46 that provides a single-phase<br>
power grid voltage 24 to the PLL 22. As shown in conjunction with FIG. 2,<br>
the PLL 22 provides a phase locked output signal 38 to the charging controller<br>
48 that monitors and charges the battery array 8.<br>
[0029] Referring now to FIG. 5, there is shown an illustration of the<br>
nominal frequency of utility power available in the United States. As can be<br>
seen, the nominal frequency resides in the range of 59.95 Hz to 60.05 Hz with<br>
the normal frequency deviation (50) residing between 59.99 Hz to 60.01 Hz.<br>
Phase error in the incoming power grid voltage can damage equipment or<br>
cause equipment malfunctions. Accordingly, phase error in the power grid is<br>
tightly regulated. Accordingly the normal frequency deviation 50 sets a<br>
minimum operating performance specification for any charging system for a<br>
hybrid vehicle that intends to offer battery array charging from a standard<br>
home (single-phase) grid voltage.<br>
[0030] Referring now to FIG. 6A and FIG. 6B, the phase tracking<br>
operation of the present invention can be seen. FIG. 6A represents the ideal<br>
case of zero degrees of phase difference (51) between the incoming power grid<br>
voltage 24 and the output phase locked signal (38). After a quarter cycle time<br>
delay 52, the phase locked loop tracking waveform 38 demonstrates that the<br>
PLL 22 has achieved phase lock with the incoming power grid voltage as can<br>
be seen at all of the zero-crossings 56. As another example, FIG. 6B<br>
illustrates a power grid voltage arriving thirty degrees out of phase (58),<br>
however, after the same quarter cycle delay 52, the PLL 22 of the present<br>
invention has achieved phase lock with the incoming power grid voltage as<br>
can be seen from the zero-crossings 56. However, it will be understood by<br>
those skilled in the art that the PLL 22 of the present invention can acquire<br>
phase lock across any phase shift of the incoming power grid signal within a<br>
quarter cycle of the incoming waveform.<br>
[0031] While rapid phase locking performance is provided by the present<br>
invention, the PLL 22 of the present invention must be able to maintain a<br>
phase lock over a wide range of incoming power grid voltage phase error (as<br>
 <br>
discussed above in reference to FIG. 5). Referring now to FIG. 7, the phase<br>
lock performance of the present invention over a wide range of incoming<br>
power grid phase error can be seen. The present invention provides reliable<br>
phase lock performance from 58 Hz to 62 Hz; well beyond the nominal<br>
frequency deviation discussed in conjunction with FIG. 5. More particularly,<br>
as can be seen (60) around the normal deviation, the present invention reliably<br>
achieves phase lock after only one-quarter cycle given the normal incoming<br>
power grid voltage phase error to be able to charge an electric vehicle or a<br>
hybrid vehicle from a standard single-phase power grid voltage. Accordingly,<br>
the present invention affords the opportunity to recharge the battery array of<br>
an electric vehicle or a hybrid vehicle from a standard single-phase power grid<br>
voltage without operating the vehicle or consuming fuel.<br>
[0032] Some of the embodiments and implementations are described<br>
above in terms of functional and/or logical block components and various<br>
processing steps. However, it should be appreciated that such block<br>
components may be realized by any number of hardware, software, and/or<br>
firmware components configured to perform the specified functions. For<br>
example, an embodiment of a system or a component may employ various<br>
integrated circuit components, e.g., memory elements, digital signal<br>
processing elements, logic elements, look-up tables, or the like, which may<br>
carry out a variety of functions under the control of one or more<br>
microprocessors or other control devices. In addition, those skilled in the art<br>
will appreciate that embodiments described herein are merely exemplary<br>
implementations.<br>
[0033] In this document, relational terms such as first and second, and the<br>
like may be used solely to distinguish one entity or action from another entity<br>
or action without necessarily requiring or implying any actual such<br>
relationship or order between such entities or actions. Furthermore, depending<br>
on the context, words such as "connect" or "coupled to" used in describing a<br>
relationship between different elements do not imply that a direct physical<br>
connection must be made between these elements. For example, two elements<br>
 <br>
may be connected to each other physically, electronically, logically, or in any<br>
other manner, through one or more additional elements.<br>
While at least one exemplary embodiment has been presented in the foregoing<br>
detailed description, it should be appreciated that a vast number of variations<br>
exist. It should also be appreciated that the exemplary embodiment or<br>
exemplary embodiments are only examples, and are not intended to limit the<br>
scope, applicability, or configuration of the invention in any way. Rather, the<br>
foregoing detailed description will provide those skilled in the art with a<br>
convenient road map for implementing the exemplary embodiment or<br>
exemplary embodiments. It should be understood that various changes can be<br>
made in the function and arrangement of elements without departing from the<br>
scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims and the legal<br>
