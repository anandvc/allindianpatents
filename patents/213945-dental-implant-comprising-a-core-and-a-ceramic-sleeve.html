				<td>DENTAL IMPLANT COMPRISING A CORE AND A CERAMIC SLEEVE<br>
The invention relates to dental implant comprising a core and a ceramic<br>
sleeve. It has for its object a dental implant or prosthetic component, comprising<br>
a metallic or synthetic core and an external ceramic sleeve.<br>
There are known dental implants provided to be inserted at least in part in<br>
an osseous recess. To give these implants both satisfactory mechanical<br>
resistance and biological compatibility with the organic tissues of the patient, it has<br>
been proposed to provide a strong metallic core with a cladding or with an external<br>
sleeve of ceramic that can be integrated by the living organism. Reference could<br>
particularly be had to the patents FR2778091 (BENHAMOU), DE2419080<br>
(KIRSCHNER), FR2745998 (PROSIS), FR2693900 (PROSIS), US4713006<br>
(HAKAMATSUKA), US5310343 (HASAGAWA) and (EP0405556) (TDK).<br>
A problem to be solved is in the connection between the core and the<br>
external ceramic sleeve. According to a first technique, this connection is carried<br>
out by means of a mass that is cohesive to ceramic fixed by heat on the core<br>
(DE2419080). According to a second technique, this connection is a mechanical<br>
connection, either by force fitting (FR2745998 and FR2693900), or by screwing<br>
(US5310343, US4713006). There has also been proposed by FR2778091 a third<br>
solution, consisting in carrying out this connection by cementing.<br>
Generally speaking, the obtained connection is strong. However, it has<br>
become apparent that this strength could finally rely on the reliability of the<br>
connection between the core and the external ceramic layer, and to the genera)<br>
resistance of the implant.<br>
Moreover, as to connections according to which the ceramic layer and the<br>
core are of separate assembled elements, a difficulty to be overcome is in the<br>
delicate centering between the ceramic layer and the core.<br>
In the case of connection by force fitting, the drawback referred to above<br>
relates to the rigidity of the connection which is correspondingly greater. Moreover,<br>
force fitting gives rise to undesirable stresses in the assembled elements, and<br>
particularly in the ceramic element, which renders it fragile.<br>
In the case of connection by screwing, the clearance present between the<br>
screw threads makes more difficult to this extent the centering, and requires, as in<br>
US4713006, the use of a flexible intermediate mass for absorbing this clearance.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a dental implant or<br>
prosthetic component of the type mentioned above, whose connection between the<br>
core, which can be metallic or ceramic, and the external ceramic sleeve, will be<br>
firm without thereby involving a rigidity that is prejudicial to this connection. Still<br>
according to this object, there is proposed such a connection with precise centering<br>
between the core and the external ceramic layer.<br>
The inventive step of the present invention consists generally in making the<br>
choice of a cemented connection between the core and the external ceramic<br>
sleeve. This external sleeve is formed by a sleeve separate from the core<br>
connected to this latter by sliding thereon and is fixed by cementing. This<br>
connection is effected by providing between the core and the sleeve a reserve to<br>
receive the cement, this reserve being of a volume sufficient to permit relative<br>
mobility between the sleeve and the core, so as to absorb shocks to which the<br>
implant is subjected, clearanceing a shock absorbing role permitting a function of<br>
resilience, without thereby lessening the firmness of the obtained connection, nor<br>
giving way to substantial clearance between the core and the ceramic sleeve.<br>
It will also be seen that the sleeve, being formed independently of the core,<br>
particularly by molding, to then be fixed on the latter, is easy to obtain with<br>
dimensions relative to those of the core, for formation of the reserve.<br>
This reserve for the reception of cement is particularly formed by a spacing<br>
between the corresponding walls of the core and the sleeve, so as to provide<br>
between them a clearance, of the order comprised between 80 to 150 microns.<br>
To promote the adherence of the cement to the metal, the core preferably<br>
has striations.<br>
The cement used is preferably a mono-component resin without a solvent,<br>
that is polymerized by exposure to UVA.<br>
More particularly, this cement is preferably a thixotropic cement of a density<br>
of the order of 1.12g/cm3 at 25°C, whose hardening time under exposure to<br>
40mW/cm2 is of the order of 10 seconds. This cement has after polymerization a<br>
Shore hardness of the order of 75D, with a temperature resistance comprised<br>
between -55°C and +135°C.<br>
Preferably, the material at the core is titanium or other metal, whilst that of<br>
the sleeve is zirconia or alumina.<br>
The core can also be made of a synthetic material.<br>
The present invention will be better understood and the details thereof will<br>
be made clear, from the description which follows of examples of embodiment, with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Figures 1 to 4 are views in longitudinal half cross-section of different<br>
respective embodiments of a dental implant according to a first embodiment of the<br>
invention.<br>
Figures 5 and 6 are longitudinal half cross-sectional views of a mono-block<br>
prosthetic component.<br>
Figures 7 and 8 are longitudinal half cross-sectional views of different<br>
modifications respectively of embodiment of a prosthetic dental component<br>
according to a second embodiment of the invention, in which the stump is<br>
comprised by two elements, respectively a and b, provided to be assembled with<br>
each other.<br>
In the figures, a dental implant or the like comprises a metallic core 1 and an<br>
external layer 2 of ceramic, which envelopes at least partially the core 1. The<br>
external ceramic layer is constituted by a sleeve 2 of zirconia obtained by molding,<br>
which is connected after it is produced, about the core 1, to which it is fixed by<br>
cementing.<br>
A clearance J is provided between the corresponding facing surfaces of the<br>
core 1 and the sleeve 2, to form between these latter a reserve 3 for the reception<br>
of the cement.<br>
