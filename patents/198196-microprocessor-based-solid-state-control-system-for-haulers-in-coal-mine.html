Brief Description of The Invention :-<br>
The system as per the invention is a microprocessor based controller for a squirrel cage induction motor, which is so interfaced through the control panel to the conventional system, to enable the operation of motor by choice either by conventional system or through microprocessor.<br>
The system as per the invention is a microprocessor based solid state control system housed in a sheet metal housing. The housing has three portions divided such as to comprise:-<br>
1.	Top - mode selector portion.<br>
2.	Centre - MBSC control system portion.<br>
3.	Lower - motor control system portion.<br>
The wiring and cabling is done such as desired to run the system in the MBSC mode or the Conventional mode.<br><br>
The system has the MBSC mode and conventional mode wherein the user has an option to make the choice.<br>
(i) The top mode selector is a changeover unit which allows and enables the user to changeover from conventional mode to MBSC mode or vice versa.<br>

The second key pad only has four keys-start, stop, speed and direction frequently used by the operator. The first key pad is under the supervision and control of the authorized supervisor and the second key pad is operated by the layman operator.<br>
Description of The Invention :-<br>
This invention is related to hauling of coal tubs in mines more specifically it is a non-linear resistance conventional system. Therefore the conventional system breaks down very frequently and consumes very high power, thus it hampers the production and safety.<br>
Accordingly it is a principal object of the invention to provide a linear frequency control implemented with microprocessor based solid state controller within a covered housing positioned away at a safe distance and clean environment, controllable both at point of hauling and at housing end suitably. The<br><br>
present invention is not limited to any specific size and dimension and can be of any suitable size.<br>
While various changes can be incorporated in the detail construction, it is understood that such changes will be within the spirit and scope of the present invention as is defined by the claims.<br>
The mode selector changeover unit enables the user to select one of the two modes either MBSC mode or conventional mode to control the motor and thereby the haulage operation. The incoming voltage enters into the air circuit breaker.<br>
The reduction gear box interfaced to the squirrel cage motor shaft reduces the motor speed to 30:1 and drives the rope drum. The coal tub connected to the one end of the rope is transported from underground to surface.<br>
In the conventional mode, the control is manual, whereas in the MBSC mode, the output is directly interfaced to the squirrel cage Induction motor. Further in the MBSC mode, the system control program is controlled from the main key pad attached to the system. The second remote key pad enables the operator to operate the simple On/Off/speed/direction only. The description and operation of MBSC system is as follows:<br>
Three phase AC motors are comprised of two major components, the stator and the rotor. The stator is a set of three electrical windings held stationary in the motor housing. The rotor is a metal cylinder, fixed to the motor drive shaft, which rotates within the stator. The arrangement of the stator coils and the presence of three-phase AC voltage give rise to a rotating magnetic field, which drives the rotor. The speed at which the magnetic field rotates is known as the synchronous speed of the motor. Synchronous speed is a function of the frequency at which the voltage is alternating and the number of poles in the stator windings.<br><br>
The strength of the magnetic field in the gap between the rotor and stator is proportional to the amplitude of the voltage at a given frequency. The output torque capability of the motor is, therefore, a function of the applied voltage amplitude at a given frequency. When operated below (rated) speed, AC motors run in the range of constant torque. The microprocessor - based system is interfaced to the AC three phase induction motor as shown in Fig (1).further is interfaced with reduction gear box and rope drum.<br>
Incoming AC line voltage is converted to a pulsating DC voltage by the input diode bridge of the MBSC system. The DC voltage is supplied to filter capacitor bank through a charging circuit, which limits inrush current to the capacitors during power-up. The pulsating DC voltage is filtered by the capacitor, which reduces the ripple level. The filtered DC voltage enters the control section of the system, composed of six output intelligent/insulated gate bi-polar transistors (IGBTs), which make up the three output legs of the system. Each leg has one intelligent/IGBT connected to the positive bus voltage and one connected to the negative bus voltage. Alternatively switching on each leg, the intelligent/IGBT produces an alternating voltage on each of the corresponding motor windings. By switching each output intelligent/IGBT at a very high frequency (known as the carrier frequency) for varying time intervals, the system is able to produce smooth, three phase, sinusoidal output current wave which optimizes motor performances. Therefore, the power consumption is reduced by 20-40% and improved the hauler efficiency by eliminating many conventional problematic power consuming modules of conventional system.<br>
The control module consists of 16-bit microprocessor, keypad and display. System programming is accomplished via the keypad or the serial communication port. During operation the system can be controlled via the keypad, by control devices wired to the control terminal strip. The power board of MBSC system contains the control and protection circuits, which govern the six, output IGBTs. The power board also contains a charging circuit for the filter capacitors, a motor<br><br>
current feedback circuit, a voltage feedback circuit, and a fault signal circuit. It has several built in protection circuits. These include phase-to-phase and phase-to-ground short circuit protection; high and low line voltage protection, protection against excessive ambient temperature, and protection against continuous excessive output current. Activation of any of these circuits will cause the drive and thereby haulage system to shut down in a fault condition.<br>

Fig. 8illustrates the current Vs Speed graph of conventional haulage system<br><br>
Practical Investigation Of The Invention Shown In The Graph :-<br>
Fig.8 shows the current Vs Speed graph of conventional haulage system, As per the graph the conventional system takes 60 amps current at a speed of 0 rpm initially. The current was varied from 60 amps to 40 amps at a speed varying from zero to 125 RPM. Further the current was varying with speed up to 60 amps at full speed of 750 rpm. The relation is a non linear and is very poor control. Therefore, conventional system requires 60 amps current initially and excess current was wasted as a heat. At zero speed or at full speed the current drawn is maximum (60 amp).<br>
Fig. 7 shows the graph between current and speed of slip ring induction motor with Microprocessor Based Solid State Control (MBSC) system. As per the graph the MBSC system took zero Amps current at zero speed initially. The current was varying from zero to 60 Amps with the speed of 0 to 750 RPM. The current was linearly varying from zero to 60 Amps with speed. The relation was linear and is a good control over the speed. Therefore, MBSC system requires zero Amps current initially and the power saving was more initially and less in later stages. The sudden small jump at 35 Amp was due to non-uniformity of haulage road gradient. The behavior of the hauler with MBSC system was linear. Therefore better control achieved and efficiency of the hauler was improved.<br>
Advantages Of The Invention :-<br>
Following components of the conventional haulage system are eliminated by introducing the MBSC system<br>

•	Series of resistance units<br>
