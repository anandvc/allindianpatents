TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Improved Gastrin Releasing Peptide Compounds<br>
Cross reference to related applications<br>
This application claims the benefit of the filing date of U.S. Provisional Application No. 10/341,577,. filed January 13,2003.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]    This invention relates to novel gastrin releasing peptide (GRP) compounds which are useful as diagnostic imaging agents or radiotherapeutic agents. These GRP compounds are labeled with radionuclides or labels detectable by in vivo light imaging and include the use of novel linkers between the label and the targeting peptide, which provides for improved pharmacokinetics.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]    The use of radiopharmaceuticals (e.g., diagnostic imaging agents, radiotherapeutic agents) to detect and treat cancer is well known. In more recent years, the discovery of site-directed radiopharmaceuticals for cancer detection and/or treatment has gained popularity and continues to grow as the medical profession better appreciates the specificity, efficacy and utility of such compounds.<br>
[0003]    These newer radiopharmaceutical agents typically consist of a<br>
targeting agent connected to a metal chelator, which can be chelated to (e.g., complexed with)<br>
a diagnostic metal radionuclide such as, for example, technetium or indium, or a therapeutic<br>
metal radionuclide such as, for example, lutetium, yttrium, or rhenium. The role of the metal"<br>
chelator is to hold (i.e., chelate) the metal radionuclide as the radiopharmaceutical agent is<br>
delivered to the desired site. A metal chelator which does not bind strongly to the metal<br>
radionuclide would render the radiopharmaceutical agent ineffective for its desired use since<br>
the metal radionuclide would therefore not reach its desired site. Thus, further research and<br>
development led to the discovery of metal chelators, such as that reported in U.S. Pat, No.<br>
5,662,885 to Pollak et. al., hereby incorporated by reference, which exhibited strong binding<br>
affinity for metal radionuclides and the ability to conjugate with the targeting agent.<br>
Subsequently, the concept of	"spacer" to create a physical separation between the<br>
metal chelator and the targeting agent was further introduced, for example in U.S. Pat. 5,976,495 to Pollak et. al.. hereby incornorated by reference.<br><br>
[0004]    The role of the targeting agent, by virtue of its affinity for certain binding sites, is to direct the diagnostic agent, such as a radiopharmaceutical agent containing the metal radionuclide, to the desired site for detection or treatment. Typically, the targeting agent may include a protein, a peptide, or other macromolecule which exhibits a specific affinity for a given receptor. Other known targeting agents include monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), antibody fragments (Fab 's and (Fab)2 cs), and receptor-avid peptides. Donald J. Buchsbaum, "Cancer Therapy with Radiolabeled Antibodies; Pharmacokinetics of Antibodies and Their Radiolabels; Experimental Radioimmunotherapy and Methods to Increase Therapeutic Efficacy," CRC Press, Boca Raton, Chapter 10, pp. 115-140, (1995); Fischman, et al. "A Ticket to Ride: Peptide Radiopharmaceuticals," The Journal of Nuclear Medicine, vol. 34, No. 12, (Dec. 1993).<br>
[0005]    In recent years, it has been learned that some cancer cells contain gastrin releasing peptide (GRP) receptors (GRP-R) of which there are a number of subtypes. In particular, it has been shown that several types of cancer cells have over-expressed or uniquely expressed GRP receptors. For this reason, much research and study have been done on GRP and GRP analogues which bind to the GRP receptor family. One such analogue is bombesin (BBN), a 14 amino acid peptide (i.e., tetradecapeptide) isolated from frog skin which is an analogue of human GRP and which binds to GRP receptors with high specificity and with an affinitv similar to GRP.<br>
[0006]    Bombesin and GRP analogues may take the form of agonists or antagonists. Binding of GRP or BBN agonists to the GRP receptor increases the rate of cell division of these cancer cells and such agonists are internalized by the cell, while binding of GRP or BBN antagonists generally does not result in either internalization by the cell or increased rates of cell division. Such antagonists are designed to competitively inhibit endogenous GRP binding to GRP receptors and reduce the rate of cancer cell proliferation. See, e.g., Hoffken, K.; Peptides in Oncology II, Somatostatin Analogues and Bombesin Antagonists (1993), pp. 87-112. For this reason, a great deal of work has been, and is being pursued to develop BBN or GRP analogues that are antagonists. E.g., Davis et al., Metabolic Stability and Tumor Inhibition of Bombesin/GRP Receptor-Antagonists, Peptides, vol. 13, pp. 401-407, 1992.<br>
[0007]    In designing an effective compound for use as a diagnostic or<br>
therapeutic agent for cancer, ir is important that the drug have appropriate in vivo targeting<br>
and pharmacokinetic nroner,:-:*s. For e\t-.^iA ;? ^ ----i--r-^i.-, ,-!'or-u^--	-...<:></:><br>
the radiolabeled peptide have high specific uptake by the cancer cells (e.g., via GRP receptors). In addition, it is also preferred that once the radionuclide localizes at a cancer site, it remains there for a desired amount of time to deliver a highly localized radiation dose to the site.<br>
[0008]    Moreover, developing radiolabeled peptides that are cleared efficiently from normal tissues is also an important factor for radiopharmaceutical agents. When biomolecules (e.g., MAb, Fab or peptides) labeled with metallic radionuclides (via a chelate conjugation), are administered to an animal such as a human, a large percentage of the metallic radionuclide (in some chemical form) can become "trapped" in either the kidney or liver parenchyma (i.e.. is not excreted into the urine or bile). Duncan et ah; Indium-111-Diethylenetriaminepentaacetic Acid-Octreotide Is Delivered in Vivo to Pancreatic, Tumor Cell, Renal, and Hepatocyte Lysosomes, Cancer Research 57, pp. 659-671, (Feb. 15. 1997).   . For the smaller radiolabeled biomolecules (i.e., peptides or Fab), die major route of clearance of activity is through the kidneys which can also retain high levels of the radioactive metal (i.e., normally &gt;10-15% of the injected dose). Retention of metal radionuclides'in the kidney or liver is clearly undesirable. Conversely, clearance of the radiopharmaceutical from the blood stream too quickly by the kidney is also undesirable if longer diagnostic imaging or high tumor uptake for radiotherapy is needed.<br>
[0009]    Subsequent work, such as that in U.S. Pai. 6,200,546 and US 2002/0054855 to Hoffman, et. al, hereby incorporated by reference, has attempted to overcome this problem by forming a compound having the general formula X-Y-B wherein X is a group capable of complexing a metal, Y is a covalent bond on a spacer group and B is a bombesin agonist binding moiety. Such compounds were reported to have high binding affinities to GRP receptors, and the radioactivity was retained inside of the cells for extended time periods. In addition, in vivo studies in normal mice have shown that retention of the radioactive metal in the kidneys was lower than that known in the art, with the majority of the radioactivity excreted into the urine.<br>
[0010]    New and improved radiopharmaceutical and other diagnostic compounds which have improved pharmacokinetics and improved kidney excretion (i.e., lower retention of the radioactive metal in the kidney) have now been found for diagnostic imaging and therapeutic uses. For diagnostic imaging, rapid rena! excretion and low retained levels of radioactivity are critical for improved images. For radiotherapeutic use, slower<br><br>
blood clearance to allow for higher tumor uptake and better tumor targeting with low kidney retention are critical.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0125]    In the following description, various aspects of the present invention will be further elaborated. For purposes of explanation specific configurations and details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, it will also be apparent to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without the specific details. Furthermore, well known features may be omitted or simplified in order not to obscure the present invention.<br>
[0126]    In an-embodiment of the present invention, there are provided new and improved compounds for use in diagnostic imaging or radiotherapy. The compounds include an optical label or a chemical moiety capable of complexing a medically useful metal ion or radionuclide (metal chelator) attached to a GRP receptor targeting peptide by a linker or spacer group.<br>
[0127]    In general, compounds of the present invention may have the formula:<br>
M-N-O-P-G<br>
wherein M is the metal chelator (in the form complexed with a metal radionuclide or not), or an optical label, N-O-P is the linker, and G is the GRP receptor targeting peptide. Each of the metal chelator, optical label, linker, and GRP receptor targeting peptide is described in the discussion that follow.<br>
[0128]    In another embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a new and improved linker or spacer group which is capable of linking an optical label or a metal chelator to a GRP receptor targeting peptide. In general, linkers of the present invention may have the formula;<br>
N-O-P<br>
wherein each of N, O and P are defined throughout the specification.<br>
[0129]    Compounds meeting the criteria defined herein were discovered to<br>
have improved pharmacokinetic properties compared to other GRP receptor targeting peptide<br><br>
conjugates known in the art. For example, compounds containing the linkers of the present invention were retained in the bloodstream longer, and thus had a longer half life than prior known compounds. The longer half life was medically beneficial because it permitted better tumor targeting which is useful for diagnostic imaging, and especially for therapeutic uses, where the cancerous cells and tumors receive greater amounts of the radiolabeled peptides.<br>
1A.      Metal Chelator<br>
[0130]    The term :'metal chelator" refers to a molecule that forms a complex with a metal atom, wherein said complex is stable under physiological conditions. That is, the metal will remain complexed to the chelator backbone in vivo. More particularly, a metal chelator is a molecule that complexes to a radionuclide metal to form a metal complex that is stable under physiological conditions and which also has at least one reactive functional group for conjugation with the linker N-O-P. The metal chelator M may be any of the metal chelators known in the art for complexing a medically useful metal ion or radionuclide. The metal chelator may or may not be complexed with a metal radionuclide. Furthermore, the metal chelator can include an optional spacer such as, for example, a single amino acid (e.g., Gly) which does not complex with the metal, but which creates a physical separation between the metal chelator and the linker.<br>
[0131]    The metal chelators of the invention may include, for example, linear, macrocyclic, terpyridine, andNaS, N2S2, orN4 chelators (see also, U.S. 5,367,080, U.S. 5,364,613, U.S. 5,021,556, U.S. 5,075,099, U.S. 5,886,142, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety), and other chelators known in the art including, but not limited to, HYNIC, DTPA, EDTA, DOTA, TETA, and bisamino bisthiol (BAT) chelators (see also U.S. 5,720,934).

[0138]    In a preferred embodiment, the metal chelator includes cyclic or acyclic polyaminocarboxylic acids such as DOTA (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane -1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid), DTPA (diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid), DTPA-bismethylamide, DTPA-bismorpholineamide, Cm4pml0d2a (4-carbonylmethyl-10-phosponomethyl-1,4,7,10-Tetraazacyclododecane-l,7-diacetic acid), DO3A7V-[[4,7,10-Tris(carboxymethyl)~l34,7,10-tetraazacyclododec-l-yl]acetyl, HP-D03A, D03A-monoamide and derivatives thereof.<br>
[0139]    Preferred metal radionuclides for scintigraphy or radiotherapy include 99mTc, 51Cr, 67Ga, 68Ga, 47Sc, 5ICr, 167Tm, I41Ce, mIn, 168Yb, 175Yb, 140La, 90Y, 88Y, !53Sm, 166Ho, 165Dy, 166Dy, 62Cu, wCu, 67Cu, 97Ru, I03Ru, 186Re, 188Re, 203Pb, 2I1Bi, 212Bi, 213Bi, 214Bi, 105Rh, !09Pd, 117mSn, 149Pm, 161Tb, 177Lu, 198Au and 199Au and oxides or nitrides thereof. The choice of metal will be determined based on the desired therapeutic or diagnostic application. For example, for diagnostic purposes (e.g., to diagnose and monitor therapeutic progress in primary tumors and metastases), the preferred radionuclides include 4Cu,    Ga,    Ga, 99mTc, and U1ln, with   mTc and     In being especially preferred. For therapeutic purposes (e.g., to provide radiotherapy for primary tumors and metastasis related to cancers of the prostate, breast, lung, etc.), the preferred radionuclides include 64Cu, 90Y, 105Rh, mIn, !17mSn, 149Pm, ,53Smf 161Tb, 166Dy, 166Ho, 175Yb, 177Lu, 186/188Re, and 199Au, with 177Lu and 90Y being particularly preferred. 99mTc is particularly useful and is a preferred for diagnostic radionuclide because of its low cost, availability, imaging properties, and high specific activity. The nuclear and radioactive properties of 99mTc make this isotope an ideal scintigraphic imaging agent. This isotope has a single photon energy of 140 keV and a radioactive half-life of about 6 hours, and is readily available from a    Mo-  mTc generator. For example, the   mTc labeled peptide can be used to diagnose and monitor therapeutic progress in primary tumors and metastases. Peptides labeled with     Lu,    Y or other therapeutic radionuclides can be used to provide radiotherapy for primary tumors and metastasis related to cancers of the prostate, breast, lung, etc.<br><br>
IB.	Optical Labels<br>
[0140]    In an exemplary embodiment, the compounds of the invention may be conjugated with photolabels, such as optical dyes, including organic chromophores or fluorophores, having extensive delocalized ring systems and having absorption or emission maxima in the range of 400-1500 nm. The compounds of the invention may alternatively be derivatized with a bioluminescent molecule. The preferred range of absorption maxima for photolabels is between 600 and 1000 nm to minimize interference with the signal from hemoglobin. Preferably, photoabsorption labels have large molar absorptivities, e.g. &gt; 105 cm^M"1, while fluorescent optical dyes will have high quantum yields. Examples of optical dyes include, but are not limited to those described in WO 98/18497, WO 98/18496, WO 98/18495, WO 98/18498, WO 98/53857, WO 96/17628, WO 97/18841, WO 96/23524, WO 98/47538, and references cited therein. For example, the photolabels may be covalently linked directly to compounds of the invention, such as, for example, compounds comprised of GRP receptor targeting peptides and linkers of the invention.  Several dyes that absorb and emit light in the visible and near-infrared region of electromagnetic spectrum are currently being used for various biomedical applications due to their biocompatibility, high molar absorptivity, and/or high fluorescence quantum yields. The high sensitivity of the optical modality in conjunction with dyes as contrast agents parallels that of nuclear medicine, and permits visualization of organs and tissues without the undesirable effect of ionizing radiation. Cyanine dyes with intense absorption and emission in the near-infrared (NIR) region are particularly useful because biological tissues are optically transparent in this region. For example, indocyanine green, which absorbs and emits in the NIR region has been used for monitoring cardiac output, hepatic functions, and liver blood flow and its functionalized derivatives have been used to conjugate biomolecules for diagnostic purposes (R. B. Mujumdar, L. A. Ernst, S. R. Mujumdar, et ah, Cyanine dye labeling reagents: Sulfoindocyanine succinimidyl esters. Bioconjugate Chemistry, 1993, 4(2), 105-111; Linda G. Lee and Sam L. Woo.

2D.      Other Linking Groups<br>
[0152]    Other linking groups which may be used within the linker N-O-P include a chemical group that serves to couple the GRP receptor targeting peptide to the metal chelator or optical label while not adversely affecting either the targeting function of the GRP receptor targeting peptide or the metal complexing function of the metal chelator or the detectability of the optical label. Suitable other linking groups include peptides (i.e., amino acids linked together) alone, a non-peptide group (e.g., hydrocarbon chain) or a combination of an amino acid sequence and a non-peptide spacer.<br>
[0153]    In one embodiment, other linking groups for use within the linker N-O-P include L-glutamine and hydrocarbon chains, or a combination thereof.<br>
[0154]    In another embodiment, other linking groups for use within the linker N-O-P include a pure peptide linking group consisting of a series of amino acids (e.g., diglycine, triglycine. gly-gly-glu, gly-ser-gly, etc.), in which, the total number of atoms between the N-terminal residue of the GRP receptor targeting peptide and the metal chelator or the optical label in the polymeric chain is 
[0155]    In yet a further embodiment, other linking groups for use within the linker N-O-P can also include a hydrocarbon chain [i.e., Rr(CH2)n-R-2] wherein n is 0-10, preferably n = 3 to 9, Ri is a group (e.g., H2N-, HS-, -COOH) that can be used as a site for covalently linking the ligand backbone or the preformed metal chelator or metal complexing backbone or optical label; and Rn is a group that is used for covalent coupling to the N-terminal NH^-group of the GRP receptor targeting peptide (e.g., Ro is an activated COOH group). Several chemical methods for conjugating ligands (i.e., chelators) or preferred metal chelates to biomolecules have been well described in the literature [Wilbur, 1992; Parker, 1990; Hermanson, 1996; Frizberg et ah, 1995]. One or more of these methods could be used to link either the uncomplexed ligand (chelator) or the radiometal chelate or optical label to the linker or to link the linker to the GRP receptor targeting peptides. These methods include the formation of acid anhydrides, aldehydes, arylisothiocyanates, activated esters, orN-hydroxysuccinimides [Wilbur, 1992; Parker, 1990; Hermanson, 1996; Frizberg et al., 1995].<br>
[0156] In a preferred embodiment, other linking groups for use within the linker N-O-P may be formed from linker precursors having electrophiles or nucleophiles as set forth below:<br><br>
LP1: a linker precursor having on at least two locations of the linker the same electrophile El or the same nucleophile Nul;<br>
LP2: a linker precursor having an electrophile El and on another location of the linker a different electrophile E2;<br>
LP3: a linker precursor having a nucleophile Nul and on another location of the linker a different nucleophile Nuz; or<br>
LP4: a linker precursor having one end functionalized with an electrophile El and the other with a nucleophile Nul.<br>
[0157]    The preferred nucleophiles Nul/Nu2 include-OH, -NH, -NR, -SH, -HN-NH2, -RN-NH2, and -RN-NHR', in which R? and R are independently selected from the definitions for R given above, but for R' is not H.<br>
[0158]    The preferred electrophiles E1/E2 include -COOH, -CH=0 (aldehyde), -CR=OR' (ketone), -RN-C=S, -RN-C=0,-S-S-2-pyridyl, -S02-Y, -CH2C(=0)Y ,<br>
and<br><br><br><br>
3.	GRP receptor targeting peptide<br>
[0159]    The GRP receptor targeting peptide {i.e., G in the formula M-N-O-P-G) is an}' peptide, equivalent, derivative or analogue thereof which has a binding affinity for the GRP receptor family.<br>
[0160]    The GRP receptor targeting peptide may take the form of an agonist or an antagonist. A GRP receptor targeting peptide agonist is known to "activate" the cell following binding with high affinity and may be internalized by the cell. Conversely, GRP receptor targeting peptide antagonists are known to bind only to the GRP receptor on the cell without being internalized by the cell and without "activating" the cell. In a preferred embodiment, the GRP receptor targeting peptide is an agonist.<br><br>
[0161]    In a more preferred embodiment of the present invention, the GRP agonist is a bombesin (BBN) analogue and/or a derivative thereof. The BBN derivative or analog thereof preferably contains either the same primary structure of the BBN binding region (i.e., BBN(7-14) [SEQ ID NO:l]) or similar primary structures, with specific amino acid substitutions that will specifically bind to GRP receptors with better or similar binding affinities as BBN alone (i.e., Kd
[0162]    It is well documented in the art that there are a few and selective number of specific amino acid substitutions in the BBN (8-14) binding region (e.g., D-Ala for L-Gly1' or D-Trp5 for L-Trp°), which can be made without decreasing binding affinity [Leban et ah, 1994; Qin et ah, 1994; Jensen et ah, 1993]. In addition, attachment of some amino acid chains or other groups to the N-terminal amine group at position BBN-8 (i.e., the Trp  residue) can dramatically decrease the binding affinity of BBN analogues to GRP receptors [Davis et ah, 1992; Hoffken, 1994; Moody et al.; 1996; Coy, et ah, 1988; Cai et ah, 1994]. In a few cases, it is possible to append additional amino acids or chemical moieties without decreasing binding affinity.<br>
[0163]    Analogues of BBN receptor targeting peptides include molecules that target the GRP receptors with avidity that is greater than or equal to BBN, as well as muteins, retropeptides and retro-inverso-peptides of GRP or BBN. One of ordinary skill will appreciate that these analogues may also contain modifications which include substitutions, and/or deletions and/or additions of one or several amino acids, insofar that these modifications do not negatively alter the biological activity of the peptides described therein. These substitutions may be carried out by replacing one or more amino acids by their synonymous amino acids. Synonymous amino acids within a group are defined as amino acids that have sufficient physicochemical properties to allow substitution between members of a group in order to preserve the biological function of the molecule.<br>
[0164]    Deletions or insertions of amino acids may also be introduced into the defined sequences provided they do not alter the biological functions of said sequences. Preferentially such insertions or deleti-.ns should be limited to 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 amino acids and<br><br>
should not .emove or physically disturb or displace amino acids which are critical to the functional conformation. Muteins of the GRP receptor targeting peptides described herein may have a sequence homologous to the sequence disclosed in the present specification in which amino acid substitutions, deletions, or insertions are present at one or more amino acid positions. Muteins may have a biological activity that is at least 40%, preferably at least 50%, more preferably 60-70%, most preferably 80-90% of the peptides described herein. However, they may also have a biological activity greater than the peptides specifically exemplified, and thus do not necessarily have to be identical to the biological function of the exemplified peptides. Analogues of GRP receptor targeting peptides also include peptidomimetics or pseudopeptides incorporating changes to the amide bonds of the peptide backbone, including thioamides, methylene amines, and E-olefms. Also peptides based on the structure of GRP, BBN or their peptide analogues with amino acids replaced by N-substituted hydrazine carbonyl compounds (also known as aza amino acids) are included in the term analogues as used herein.<br>
[0165]    The GRP receptor targeting peptide can be prepared by various methods depending upon the selected chelator. The peptide can generally be most conveniently prepared by techniques generally established and known in the art of peptide synthesis, such as the solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) approach. Solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) involves the stepwise addition of amino acid residues to a growing peptide chain that is linked to an insoluble support or matrix, such as polystyrene. The C-terminal residue of the peptide is first anchored to a commercially available support with its amino group protected with an N-protecting agent such as a t-butyloxycarbonyl group (Boc) or a fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) group. The amino protecting group is removed with suitable deprotecting agents such as TFA in the case of Boc or piperidine for Fmoc and the next amino acid residue (in N-protected form) is added with a coupling agent such as N,N5-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), or N,N'-diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC) or2-(lH-benzotriazol-l-yl)-l,l,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU). Upon formation of a peptide bond, the reagents are washed from the support. After addition of the final residue, the peptide is cleaved from the support with a suitable reagent such as trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) or hydrogen fluoride (HF).<br>
[0166]    The linker may then be coupled to form a conjugate by reacting'the free amino group of the Trp8 residue of the GRP receptor targeting peptide with an appropriate functional group of the linker. The entire construct of chelator, linker and<br><br>
targeting moiety discussed above may also be assembled on resin and then cleaved by agency of suitable reagents such as trifluoroacelic acid or HF, as well.<br>
4.	Labeling And Administration Of Radiopharmaceutical Compounds<br>
[0167]    Incorporation of the metal within the radiopharmaceutical conjugates can be achieved by various methods commonly known in the art of coordination chemistry. When the metal is 99mTc, a preferred radionuclide for diagnostic imaging, the following general procedure can be used to form a technetium complex. A peptide-chelator conjugate solution is formed by initially dissolving the conjugate in water, dilute acid, or in an aqueous solution of an alcohol such as ethanol. The solution is then optionally degassed to remove dissolved oxygen. When an -SH group is present in the peptide, a thiol protecting group such as Acm (acetamidomethyl), trityl or other thiol protecting group may optionally be used to protect the thiol from oxidation. The thiol protecting group(s) are removed with a suitable reagent, for example with sodium hydroxide, and are then neutralized with an organic acid such as acetic acid (pH 6.0-6.5). Alternatively, the thiol protecting group can be removed in situ during technetium chelation. In the labeling step, sodium pertechnetate obtained from a molybdenum generator is added to a solution of the conjugate with a sufficient amount of a reducing agent, such as stannous chloride, to reduce technetium and is either allowed to stand at room temperature or is heated. The labeled conjugate can be separated from the contaminants    mTc(V and colloidal    mTcC&gt;2 chromatographically, for example with a C-l 8 Sep Pak cartridge [Millipore Corporation, Waters Chromatography Division, 34 Maple Street, Milford, Massachusetts 01757] or by HPLC using methods known to those skilled in the art.<br>
[0168]    In an alternative method, the labeling can be accomplished by a transchelation reaction. In this method, the technetium source is a solution of technetium that is reduced and complexed with labile ligands prior to reaction with the selected chelator, thus facilitating ligand exchange with the selected chelator. Examples of suitable ligands for transchelation includes tartrate, citrate, gluconate, and heptagluconate. It will be appreciated that the conjugate can be labeled using the techniques described above, or alternatively, the chelator itself may be labeled and subsequently coupled to the peptide to form the conjugate; a process referred to as the uprelabeled chelate" method. Re and Tc are both in row VIIB of the Periodic Table and they are chemical congeners. Thus, for the most part, the complexation chemistry of these two metals with ligand frameworks that exhibit high in vitro and in vivo stabilities are the same [Eckelman, 1995] and similar chelators and procedures<br><br>
can be used to label with Re. Many " mTc or     '  J Re complexes, which are employed to<br>
form stable radiometal complexes with peptides and proteins, chelate these metals in their +5<br>
oxidation state [Lister-James et ah, 1997]. This oxidation state makes it possible to<br>
selectively place 99mTc- or      ]   Re into ligand frameworks already conjugated to the<br>
«<br>
biomolecule, constructed from a variety of 99mTc(V) and/or 186/18SRe(V) weak chelates (e.g., 99mTc- glucoheptonate, citrate, gluconate, etc.) [Eckelman, 1995; Lister-James et al., 1997; Pollaketal., 1996].<br>
5.	Diagnostic and Therapeutic Uses<br>
[0169]    When labeled with diagnostically and/or therapeutically useful metals or optical labels, compounds of the present invention can be used to treat and/or detect any pathology involving overexpression of GRP receptors (or NMB receptors) by procedures established in the art of radiodiagnostics, radiotherapeutics and optical imaging.  [See e.g., Bushbaum, 1995; Fischman et al., 1993; Schubiger et al., 1996; Lowbertz et al., 1994; Krenning et al., 1994; examples of optical dyes include, but are not limited to those described in WO 98/18497, WO 98/18496, WO 98/18495, WO 98/18498, WO 98/53857, WO 96/17628, WO 97/18841, WO 96/23524, WO 98/47538, and references cited therein.]<br>
[0170]    GRP-R expression is highly upregulated in a variety of human tumors. See e.g., WO 99/62563. Thus, compounds of the invention may be widely useful in treating and diagnosing cancers, including prostate cancer (primary and metastatic), breast cancer (primary and metastatic), colon cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, non small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, gastrinomas, melanomas, glioblastomas, neuroblastomas, uterus leiomyosarcoma tumors, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasias [PIN], and ovarian cancer. Additionally, compounds of the invention may be useful to distinguish between conditions in which GRP receptors are upregulated and those in which they are not (e.g. chronic pancreatitis and ductal pancreatic carcinoma, respectively<br>
[0171]    The compounds of the invention, which, as explained in more detail in the Examples, show higher uptake in tumors in vivo than compounds without the novel linkers disclosed herein, exhibit an improved ability to target GRP receptor-expressing tumors and thus to image or deliver radiotherapy to these tissues. Indeed, as shown in the Examples, radiotherapy is more effective (and survival time increased) using compounds of the invention.<br><br>
[0172]    The diagnostic application of these compounds can be as a first line diagnostic screen for the presence of neoplastic cells using scintigraphic, optical, sonoluminescence or photoacoustic imaging, as an agent for targeting neoplastic tissue using hand-held radiation detection instrumentation in the field of radioimmuno guided surgery (RIGS), as a means to obtain dosimetry data prior to administration of the matched pair radiotherapeutic compound, and as a means to assess GRP receptor population as a function of treatment overtime.<br>
[0173]    The therapeutic application of these compounds can be defined as an agent that will be used as a first line therapy in the treatment of cancer, as combination therapy where these agents could be utilized in conjunction with adjuvant chemotherapy, and/or as a matched pair therapeutic agent. The matched pair concept refers to a single unmetallated compound which can serve as both a diagnostic and a therapeutic agent depending on the radiometal that has been selected for binding to the appropriate chelate. If the chelator cannot accommodate the desired metals, appropriate substitutions can be made to accommodate the different metal while maintaining the pharmacology such that the behavior of the diagnostic compound in vivo can be used to predict the behavior of the radiotherapeutic compound. When utilized in conjunction with adjuvant chemotherapy any suitable chemotherapeutic may be used, including for example, antineoplastic agents, such as platinum compounds (e.g., spiroplatin, cisplatin, and carboplatin), methotrexate, adriamycin, mitomycin, ansamitocin, bleomycin, cytosine, arabinoside, arabinosyl adenine, mercaptopolylysine, vincristine, busulfan, chlorambucil, melphalan (e.g., PAM, a, L -PAM or phennylalanine mustard), mercaptopurine, mitotane. procarbazine hydrochloride, dactinomycin (actinomycin D), daunorubcin hydrochloride, doxorubicin hydrochloride, taxol, mitomycin, plicamycin (mithramycin), aminoglutethimide, estramustine phosphate sodium, flutamide, leuprolide acetate, megestrol acetate, tamoxifen citrate, testolactone, trilostane, amsacrine (m-AMSA), asparaginase (L-asparaginase) Erwina aparaginase, etoposide -(VP-16), interferon a-2a, interferon a-2b, teniposide (VM-26), vinblastine sulfate (VLB), and arabinosyl. In certain embodiments, the therapeutic may be monoclonal antibody, such as a monoclonal antibody capable of binding to melanoma antigen.<br>
[0174]    A conjugate labeled with a radionuclide metal, such as J mTc, can be administered to a mammal, including human patients or subjects, by intravenous, subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injection in a pharmaceutical^ acceptable carrier and/or solution such as salt solutions like isotonic saline. Radiolabeled scintigraphic imaging agents<br><br>
provided by the present invention are provided having a suitable amount of radioactivity.  In forming 99mTc radioactive complexes, it is generally preferred to form radioactive complexes in solutions containing radioactivity at concentrations of from about 0.01 millicurie (mCi) to 100 mCi per mL. Generally, the unit dose to be administered has a radioactivity of about 0.01 mCi to about 100 mCi. preferably 1 mCi to 30 mCi. The solution to be injected at unit dosage is from about 0.01 mL to about 10 mL. The amount of labeled conjugate appropriate for administration is dependent upon the distribution profile of the chosen conjugate in the sense that a rapidly cleared conjugate may need to be administered in higher doses than one that clears less rapidly. In vivo distribution and localization can be tracked by standard scintigraphic techniques at an appropriate time subsequent to administration; typically between thirty minutes and 180 minutes depending upon the rate of accumulation at the target site with respect to the rate of clearance at non-target tissue. For example, after injection of the diagnostic radionuclide-labeled compounds of the invention into the patient, a gamma camera calibrated for the gamma ray energy of the nuclide incorporated in the imaging agent can be used to image areas of uptake of the agent and quantify the amount of radioactivity present in the site. Imaging of the site in vivo can take place in a few minutes. However, imaging can take place, if desired, hours or even longer, after the radiolabeled peptide is injected into a patient. In most instances, a sufficient amount of the administered dose will accumulate in the area to be imaged within about 0.1 hour to permit the taking of scintiphotos.<br>
[0175]    The compounds of the present invention can be administered to a patient alone or as part of a composition that contains other components such as excipients, diluents, radical scavengers, stabilizers, and earners, all of which are well-known in the art. The compounds can be administered to patients either intravenously or intraperitoneally.<br>
[0176]    There are numerous advantages associated with the present invention. The compounds made in accordance with the present invention form stable, well-defined 99mTc or 18 n Re labeled compounds. Similar compounds of the invention can also be made by using appropriate chelator frameworks for the respective radiometals, to form stable, well-defined products labeled with I53Sm, 90Y, 166Ho, 105Rh, 199Au, 149Pm, 177Lu, mIn or other radiometal. The radiolabeled GRP receptor targeting peptides selectively bind to neoplastic cells expressing GRP receptors, and if an agonist is used, become internalized, and are retained in the tumor cells for extended time periods. The radioactive material that does not<br><br>
reach (i.e., does not bind) the cancer cells is preferentially excreted efficiently into the urine with minimal retention of the radiometal in the kidnevs.<br>
6.	Optical Imaging, Sonoluminescence, Photoacoustic Imaging and<br>
Phototherapy<br>
[0177]    In accordance with the present invention, a number of optical parameters may be employed to determine the location of a target with in vivo light imaging after injection of the subject with an optically-labeled compound of the invention. Optical parameters to be detected in the preparation of an image may include transmitted radiation, absorption, fluorescent or phosphorescent emission, light reflection, changes in absorbance amplitude or maxima, and elastically scattered radiation. For example, biological tissue is relatively translucent to light in the near infrared (NIR) wavelength range of 650-1000 nm. NIR radiation can penetrate tissue up to several centimeters, permitting the use of compounds of the present invention to image target-containing tissue in vivo. The use of visible and near-infrared (NIR) light in clinical practice is growing rapidly. Compounds absorbing or emitting in the visible, NIR, or long-wavelength (UV-A, &gt;350 nm) region of the electromagnetic spectrum are potentially useful for optical tomographic imaging, endoscopic visualization, and phototherapy.<br>
[0178]    A major advantage of biomedical optics lies in its therapeutic potential. Phototherapy has been demonstrated to be a safe and effective procedure for the treatment of various surface lesions, both external and internal. Dyes are important to enhance signal detection and/or photosensitizing of tissues in optical imaging and phototherapy. Previous studies have shown that certain dyes can localize in tumors and serve as a powerful probe for the detection and treatment of small cancers (D. A. Bellnier et al., Murine pharmacokinetics and antitumor efficacy of the photodynamic sensitizer 2-[l-hexyloxyethyl]-2-devinylpyropheophorbide-a, J. Photochem. Photobiol., 1993, 20, pp. 55-61; G. A.

Reynolds et al., Imaging of spontaneous canine mammary tumors using fluorescent contrast agents, Photochem. Photobiol., 1999, 70, pp. 87-94). However, these dyes do not localize preferentially in malignant tissues.<br>
[0179]    In an exemplary embodiment, the compounds of the invention may be conjugated with photolabels, such as optical dyes, including organic chromophores or<br><br>
fluorophores, having extensive delocalized ring systems and having absorption or emission maxima in the range of 400-1500 nm. The compounds of the invention may alternatively be derivatized with a bioluminescent molecule. The preferred range of absorption maxima for photolabels is between 600 and 1000 nm to minimize interference with the signal from hemoglobin. Preferably, photoabsorption labels have large molar absorptivities, e.g. &gt; 103 CUT'M*1, while fluorescent optical dyes will have high quantum yields. Examples of optical dyes include, but are not limited to those described in WO 98/18497, WO 98/18496, WO 98/18495, WO 98/18498, WO 98/53857, WO 96/17628, WO 97/18841, WO 96/23524, WO 98/47538, and references cited therein. For example, the photolabels may be covalently linked directly to compounds of the invention, such as, for example, compounds comprised of GRP receptor targeting peptides and linkers of the invention. Several dyes that absorb and emit light in the visible and near-infrared region of electromagnetic spectrum are currently being used for various biomedical applications due to their biocompatibility, high molar absorptivity, and/or high fluorescence quantum yields. The high sensitivity of the optical modality in conjunction with dyes as contrast agents parallels that of nuclear medicine, and permits visualization of organs and tissues without the undesirable effect of ionizing radiation. Cyanine dyes with intense absorption and emission in the near-infrared (NIR) region are particularly useful because biological tissues are optically transparent in this region (B. C. Wilson, Optical properties of tissues. Encyclopedia of Human Biology, 1991, 5, 587-597). For example, indocyanine green, which absorbs and emits in the NIR region has been used for monitoring cardiac output, hepatic functions, and liver blood flow (Y-L. He, H. Tanigami, H. Ueyama, T. Mashimo, and I. Yoshiya, Measurement of blood volume using indocyanine green measured with pulse-spectrometry: Its reproducibility and reliability. Critical Care Medicine, 1998, 26(8), 1446-1451; J. Caesar, S. Shaldon, L. Chiandussi, et ah, The use of Indocyanine green in the measurement of hepatic blood flow and as a test of hepatic function. Clin. Sci. 1961, 21, 43-57) and its functionalized derivatives have been used to conjugate biomolecules for diagnostic purposes (R. B. Mujumdar, L. A. Ernst, S. R. Mujumdar, et ah, Cyanine dye labeling reagents: Sulfoindocyanine succinimidyl esters. Bioconjugate Chemistry, 1993, 4(2), 105-111; Linda G. Lee and Sam L. Woo.

[0180]    After injection of the optically-labeled compound, the patient is    • scanned with one or more light sources (e.g., a laser) in the wavelength range appropriate for the photolabel employed in the agent. The light used may be monochromatic or polychromatic and continuous or pulsed. Transmitted, scattered, or reflected light is detected via a photodetector tuned to one or multiple wavelengths to determine the location of target-containing tissue (e.g., tissue containing GRP) in the subject. Changes in the optical parameter may be monitored over time to detect accumulation of the optically-labeled reagent at the target site (e.g. the tumor or other site with GRP receptors). Standard image processing and detecting devices may be used in conjunction with the optical imaging reagents of the present invention.<br>
[0181]    The optical imaging reagents described above may also be used for acousto-optical or sonoluminescent imaging performed with optically-labeled imaging agents (see, U.S. 5,171,298, WO 98/57666, and references therein). In acousto-optical imaging, ultrasound radiation is applied to the subject and affects the optical parameters of the transmitted, emitted, or reflected light.  In sonoluminescent imaging, the applied ultrasound actually generates the light detected. Suitable imaging methods using such techniques are described in WO 98/57666.<br>
[0182]    Various imaging techniques and reagents are described in U.S. Patents 6,663,847, 6,656,451, 6,641,798, 6,485,704, 6,423,547, 6,395,257, 6,280,703, 6,277,841, 6,264,920, 6,264,919, 6,228,344, 6,217,848, 6,190,641, 6,183,726, 6,180,087, 6,180,086, 6,180,085, 6,013,243, and published U.S. Patent Applications 2003185756, 20031656432, 2003158127, 2003152577, 2003143159, 2003105300, 2003105299, 2003072763, 2003036538, 2003031627, 2003017164, 2002169107, 2002164287, and 2002156117.<br>
7.	Radiotherapy<br>
[0183]    Radioisotope therapy involves the administration of a radiolabeled compound in sufficient quantity to damageor destroy the targeted tissue. After administration of the compound (by e.g., intravenous, subcutaneous, or intraperitonal injection;, the radiolabeled pharmaceutical localizes preferentially at the disease site (in this instance, tumor tissue or other tissue that expresses the GRP receptor). Once localized, the radiolabeled<br><br>
compound then damages or destroys the diseased tissue with the energy that is released during the radioactive decay of the isotope that is administered. As discussed herein, the invention also encompasses use of radiotherapy in combination with adjuvant chemotherapy (or in combination with any other appropriate therapeutic agent).<br>
[0184]    The design of a successful radiotherapeutic involves several critical factors:<br>
1.	selection of an appropriate targeting group to deliver the radioactivity to the disease site;<br>
2.	selection of an appropriate radionuclide that releases sufficient energy to damage that disease site, without substantially damaging adjacent normal tissues; and<br>
3.	selection of an appropriate combination of the targeting group and the radionuclide without adversely affecting the ability of this conjugate to localize at the disease site. For radiometals, this often involves a chelating group that coordinates tightly to the radionuclide, combined with a linker that couples said chelate to the targeting group, and that affects the overall biodistribution of the compound to maximize uptake in target tissues and minimize uptake in normal, non-target organs.<br>
[0185]    The present invention provides radiotherapeutic agents that satisfy all three of the above criteria, through proper selection of targeting group, radionuclide, metal chelate and linker.<br>
[0186]    Radiotherapeutic agents may contain a chelated 3+ metal ion from the class of elements known as the lanthanides (elements of atomic number 57-71) and their analogs (i.e. MJ  metals such as yttrium and indium). Typical radioactive metals in this class include the isotopes 90-Yttrium, Ill-Indium, 149-Promethium, 153-Samarium, 166-Dysprosium, 166-Holmium, 175-Ytterbium, and 177-Lutetium. All of these metals (and others in the lanthanide series) have very similar chemistries, in that they remain in the +3 oxidation state, and prefer to chelate to ligands that bear hard (oxygen/nitrogen) donor atoms, as typified by derivatives of the well known chelate DTPA (diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid) and polyaza-polycarboxylate macrocycles such as DOTA (1,4,7,10-tetrazacyclododecane-N, N\N",N"'-tetraacetic acid and its close analogs. The structures of these chelating ligands, in their fully deprotonated form are shown below.<br><br><br>
[0187]    These chelating ligands encapsulate the radiometal by binding to it via multiple nitrogen and oxygen atoms, thus preventing the release of free (unbound) radiometal into the body. This is important, as in vivo dissociation of 3+ radiometals from their chelate can result in uptake of the radiometal in the liver, bone and spleen [Brechbiel MW, Gansow OA, "Backbone-substituted DTP A ligands for 90Y radioimmunotherapv", Bioconj. Chem. 1991; 2: 187-194; Li, WP, Ma DS, Higginbotham C, Hoffman T, Ketring AR, Cutler CS, Jurisson, SS,,; Development of an in vitro model for assessing the in vivo stability of lanthanide chelates." Nucl. Med. Biol. 2001; 28(2): 145-154; KasokatT, UrichK. Arzneim.-Forsch, "Quantification of dechelation of gadopentetate dimeglumine in rats". 1992; 42(6): 869-76]. Unless one is specifically targeting these organs, such non-specific uptake is highly undesirable, as it leads to non-specific irradiation of non-target tissues, which can lead to such problems as hematopoietic suppression due to irradiation of bone marrow.<br>
[0188]    For radiotherapy applications any of the chelators for therapeutic radionuclides disclosed herein may be used. However, forms of the DOTA chelate [Tweedle MF, Gaughan GT, Hagan JT, "l-Substituted-l,4,7-triscarboxymethyl-l,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane and analogs." US Patent 4,885,363, Dec. 5, 1989] are particularly preferred, as the DOTA chelate is expected to de-chelate less in the body than DTPA or other linear chelates.<br>
[0189]    General methods for coupling DOTA-type macrocycles to targeting groups through a linker (e.g. by activation of one of the carboxylates of the DOTA t© form an active ester, which is then reacted with an amino group on the linker to form a stable amide bond), are known to those skilled in the art. (See e.g. Tweedle et al. US Patent 4,885,363).<br><br>
Coupling can also be performed on DOTA-type macrocycles that are modified on the backbone of the polyazadng,<br>
[0190]    The selection of a proper nuclide for use in a particular radiotherapeutic application depends on many factors, including:<br>
a.	Physical half-life - This should be long enough to allow synthesis and<br>
purification of the radiotherapeutic construct from radiometal and conjugate, and delivery of<br>
said construct to the site of injection, without significant radioactive decay prior to injection.<br>
Preferably, the radionuclide should have a physical half-life between about 0.5 and 8 days.<br>
b.	Energy of the emissionfs) from the radionuclide - Radionuclides that<br>
are particle emitters (such as alpha emitters, beta emitters and Auger electron emitters) are<br>
particularly useful, as they emit highly energetic particles that deposit their energy over short<br>
distances, thereby producing highly localized damage. Beta emitting radionuclides are<br>
particularly preferred, as the energy from beta particle emissions from these isotopes is<br>
deposited within 5 to about 150 cell diameters. Radiotherapeutic agents prepared from these<br>
nuclides are capable of killing diseased cells that are relatively close to their site of<br>
localization, but cannot travel long distances to damage adjacent normal tissue such as bone<br>
marrow.<br>
c.	Specific activity (i.e. radioactivity per mass of the radionuclide) -<br>
Radionuclides that have high specific activity (e.g. generator produced 90-Y, 111 -In, 177-Lu)<br>
are particularly preferred. The specific activity of a radionuclide is determined by its method<br>
of production, the particular target that is used to produce it, and the properties of the isotope<br>
in question.<br>
[0191]    Many of the lanthanides and lanthanoids include radioisotopes that have nuclear properties that make them suitable for use as radiotherapeutic agents, as they emit beta particles. Some of these are listed in the table below.<br><br><br><br>
[0192]    Methods for the preparation of radiometals such as beta-emitting lanthanide radioisotopes are known to those skilled in the art, and have been described elsewhere [e.g. Cutler C S, Smith CJ, Ehrhardt GJ.; Tyler TT, Jurisson SS, Deutsch E. "Current and potential therapeutic uses of lanthanide radioisotopes." Cancer Biother. Radiopharm. 2000; 15(6): 531-545]. Many of these isotopes can be produced in high yield for relatively low cost, and many (e.g. 90-Y, 149-Pm, 177-Lu) can be produced at close to carrier-free specific activities (i.e. the vast majority of atoms are radioactive). Since nonradioactive atoms can compete with their radioactive analogs for binding to receptors on the target tissue, the use of high specific activity radioisotope is important, to allow delivery of as high a dose of radioactivity to the target tissue as possible.<br>
[0193]    Radiotherapeutic derivatives of the invention containing beta-emitting isotopes of rhenium (    -Re and " -Re) are also particularly preferred.<br>
8.	Dosages And Additives<br>
[0194]    Proper dose schedules for the compounds of the present invention are known to those skilled in the art. The compounds can be administered using many methods which include, but are not limited to, a single or multiple IV or IP injections. For radiopharmaceuticals, one administers a quantity of radioactivity that is sufficient to permit imaging or, in the case of radiotherapy, to cause damage or ablation of the targeted GRP-R bearing tissue, but not so much that substantive damage is caused to non-target (normal tissue). The quantity and dose required for scintigraphic imaging is discussed supra. The quantity and dose required for radiotherapy is also different for different constructs, depending on the energy and half-life of the isotope used, the degree of uptake and clearance of the agent from the body and the mass of the tumor. In general, doses can range from a single dose of about 30-50 mCi to a cumulative dose of up to about 3 Curies.<br>
[Insert dosage info for optical compounds]<br>
[0195]    The compositions of the invention can include physiologically acceptable buffers, and can require radiation stabilizers to prevent radiolytic damage to the<br><br>
compound prior u injection. Radiation stabilizers are known to those skilled in the art, and may include, for example, para-aminobenzoic acid, ascorbic acid, gentistic acid and the like.<br>
[0196]    A single, or multi-vial kit that contains all of the components needed to prepare the diagnostic or therapeutic agents of this invention is an integral part of this invention. In the case of radiopharmaceuticals, such kits will often include all necessary ingredients except the radionuclide.<br>
[0197]    For example, a single-vial kit for preparing a radiopharmaceutical of the invention preferably contains a chelator/linker/targeting peptide conjugate of the formula M-N-O-P-G, a source of stannous salt (if reduction is required, e.g., when using technetium), or other pharmaceutical^ acceptable reducing agent, and is appropriately buffered with pharmaceutically acceptable acid or base to adjust the pH to a value of about 3 to about 9. The quantity and type of reducing agent used will depend highly on the nature of the exchange complex to be formed. The proper conditions are well known to those that are skilled in the art. It is preferred that the kit contents be in lyophilized form. Such a single vial kit may optionally contain labile or exchange ligands such as glucoheptonate, gluconate, mannitol, malate, citric or tartaric acid and can also contain reaction modifiers such as diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid (DPTA), ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), or a, P, or y-cyclodextrin that serve to improve the radiochemical purity and stability of the final product. The kit may also contain stabilizers, bulking agents such as mannitol, that are designed to aid in the freeze-drying process, and other additives known to those skilled in the art.<br>
[0198]    A multi-vial kit preferably contains the same general components but employs more than one vial in reconstituting the radiopharmaceutical. For example, one vial may contain all of the ingredients that are required to form a labile Tc(V) complex on addition of pertechnetate (e.g. the stannous source or other reducing agent). Pertechnetate is added to this vial, and after waiting an appropriate period of time, the contents of this vial are added to a second vial that contains the chelator and targeting peptide, as well as buffers appropriate to adjust the pH to its optimal value. After a reaction time of about 5 to 60 minutes, the complexes of the present invention are formed. It is advantageous that the contents of both vials of this multi-vial kit be lyophilized. As above, reaction modifiers, exchange ligands, stabilizers, bulking agents, etc. may be present in either or both vials.<br><br>
General Preparation Of Compounds<br>
[0199]    The compounds of the present invention can be prepared by various methods depending upon the selected chelator. The peptide portion of the compound can be most conveniently prepared by techniques generally established and known in the art of peptide synthesis, such as the solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) approach. Because it is amenable to solid phase synthesis, employing alternating FMOC protection and deprotection is the prefeaed method of making short peptides. Recombinant DNA technology is preferred for producing proteins and long fragments thereof.<br>
[0200]    Solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) involves the stepwise addition of amino acid residues to a growing peptide chain that is linked to an insoluble support or matrix, such as polystyrene. The C-terminal residue of the peptide is First anchored to a commercially available support with its amino group protected with an N-protecting agent such as a t-butyloxycarbonyl group (Boc) or a fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) group. The amino protecting group is removed with suitable deprotecting agents such as TFA in the case of Boc or piperidine for Fmoc and the next amino acid residue (in N-protected form) is added with a coupling agent such as diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC). Upon formation of a peptide bond, the reagents are washed from the support. After addition of the final residue, the peptide is cleaved from the support with a suitable reagent such as trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) or hydrogen fluoride (HF).<br>
Alternative Preparation of the Compounds via Segment Coupling<br>
[0201]    The compounds of the invention may also be prepared by the process known in the art as segment coupling or fragment condensation (Barlos, K. and Gatos, D. ; 2002 "Convergent Peptide Synthesis" in Fmoc Solid Phase Synthesis - A Practical Approach', Eds. Chan, W.C. and White, P.D.; Oxford University Press, New York; Chap. 9, pp 215-228). In this method segments of the peptide usually in side-chain protected form, are prepared separately by either solution phase synthesis or solid phase synthesis or a combination of the two methods. The choice of segments is crucial and is made using a division strategy that can provide a manageable number of segments whose C-terminal residues and N-terminal residues are projected to provide the cleanest coupling in peptide synthesis. The C-terminal residues of the best segments are either devoid of chiral alpha carbons (glycine or other moieties achiral at the carbon cc to the carboxyl group to be activated in the coupling step j or are compromised of amino acids whose propensity to<br><br>

B.	Materials<br>
[0205]    The Fmoc-protected amino acids used were purchased from Nova-Biochem (San Diego, CA, USA), Advanced Chem Tech (Louisville, KY., USA), Chem-Impex International (Wood Dale 111., USA), and Multiple Peptide Systems (San Diego, CA., USA). Other chemicals, reagents and adsorbents required for the syntheses were procured from Aldrich Chemical Co. (Milwaukee, WI, USA) and VWR Scientific Products (Bridgeport, NJ., USA). Solvents for peptide synthesis were obtained from Pharmco Co. (Brookfield CT., USA). Columns for HPLC analysis and purification were obtained from Waters Co. (Milford, MA., USA). Experimental details are given below for those that were not commercially available.<br>
C.	Instaimentation for Peptide Synthesis<br>
[0206]    Peptides were prepared using an Advanced ChemTech 496 Q MOS synthesizer, an Advanced ChemTech 357 FBS synthesizer and/or by manual peptide synthesis. However the protocols for iterative deprotection and chain extension employed were the same for all.<br>
D.	Automated synthesis with the Symphony instrument (made by Rainin)<br>
[0207]    The synthesis was run with Symphony Version 3 supplied by Protein Technologies Inc. Novagel TGR resin, with a substitution of 0.25 mmol/g, was used, and each well contained 0.2 g of the resin (50 jamol). The amino acids were dissolved inNMP and the concentration was 0.25M. A 0.25M solution of HBTU and N-Methylmorpholine in DMF was prepared and used for the coupling. All the couplings were carried out for 2.0 h. The cleavage was done outside the machine by transferring the resin to another reaction vessel and using reagent B as iji the manual synthesis<br>
E.	Instrumentation Employed for Analysis and Purification<br>
[0208]    Analytical HPLC was performed using a Shimadzu-LC-lOA dual pump gradient analytical LC system employing Shimadzu-ClassVP software version 4.1 for<br><br>
system control, data acquisition, and post run processing. Mass spectra were acquired on a Hewlett-Packard Series 1100 MSD mass spectrometer interfaced with a Hewlett-Packard Series 1100 dual pump gradient HPLC system fitted with an Agilent Technologies 1100 series autosampler fitted for either direct flow injection or injection onto a Waters Associates XTerra MS CIS column (4.6 mm x 50 mm, 5u particle, 120A pore). The instrument was driven by a PIP Kayak workstation using 'MSD .Anyone' software for sample submission and HP Chemstation software for instrument control and data acquisition. In most cases the samples were introduced via direct injection using a 5 jaL injection of sample solution at a concentration of 1 mg/mL and analyzed using positive ion electrospray to obtain m/e and m/z (multiply charged) ions for confirmation of structure. 'H-NMR spectra were obtained on a<br>
1 T<br>
Varian Innova spectrometer at 500 MHz.     C-NMR spectra were obtained on the same instrument at 125.73 MHz. Generally the residual  H absorption, or in the case of   C-NMR, the "C absorption of the solvent employed, was used as an internal reference; in other cases tctramethylsilane (u = 0.00 ppm) was employed. Resonance values are given in {i units. Micro-analysis data was obtained from Quantitative Technologies Inc. Whitehouse NJ. Preparative HPLC was performed on a Shimadzu-LC-8A dual pump gradient preparative HPLC system employing Shimadzu-ClassVP software version 4.3 for system control, data acquisition, fraction collection and post run processing<br>
F.	General Procedure for Peptide Synthesis<br>
[0209]    Rink Amide-Novagel HL resin (0.6 mmol/g) was used as the solid support.<br>
G.	Coupling Procedure<br>
[0210]    In a typical experiment, the first amino acid was loaded onto 0.1 g of the resin (0.06 mmol). The appropriate Fmoc-amino acid in NMP (0.25M solution; 0.960 mL was added to the resin followed by N-hydroxybenzotriazole (0.5M in NMP; 0.48 mL)) and the reaction block (in the case of automated peptide synthesis) or individual reaction vessel (in the case of manual peptide synthesis) was shaken for about 2 min. To the above mixture, diisopropylcarbodiimide (0.5M in NMP; 0.48 mL) was added and the reaction mixture was shaken for 4h at ambient temperature. Then the reaction block or the individual reaction vessel was purged of reactants by application of a positive pressure of dry nitrogen.<br><br>
H.        Washing Procedure<br>
[0211]    Each well of the reaction block was filled with 1.2 mL of NMP and the block was shaken for 5 min. The solution was drained under positive pressure of nitrogen. This procedure was repeated three times. The same procedure was used, with an appropriate volume of NMP, in the case of manual synthesis using individual vessels.<br>
I.	Removal of Fmoc Group<br>
&gt; [0212]    The resin containing the Fmoc-protected amino acid was treated with<br>
1.5 mL of 20% piperidine in DMF (v/v) and the reaction block or individual manual synthesis<br>
vessel was shaken for 15 min. The solution was drained from the resin. This procedure was<br>
repeated once and the resin was washed employing the washing procedure described above.<br>
J.	Final coupling of ligand fDOTA and CMDOTA)<br>
[0213]    The X-terminal amino group of the resin bound peptide linker construct was deblocked and the resin was washed. A 0.25M solution of the desired ligand and HBTU in NMP was made, and was treated with a two-fold equivalency of DIEA. The resulting solution of activated ligand was added to the the resin (1.972 mL; 0.48 mmol) and the reaction mixture was shaken at ambient temperature for 24-30 h. The solution was drained and the resin was washed. The final wash of the resin was conducted with 1.5 mL dichloromethane (3X).<br>
K.        Deprotection and purification of the final peptide<br>
[0214]    A solution of reagent B (2 mL; 88:5:5:2 - TFA:Phenol:Water:TIPS) was added to the resin and the reaction block or individual vessel was shaken for 4.5h at ambient temperature. The resulting solution containing the deprotected peptide was drained into a vial. This procedure was repeated two more times with 1 mL of reagent B. The combined filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure using a Genevac HT-12 series II centrifugal concentrator. The residue in each vial was then triturated with 2 mL of Et20 and the supernatant was decanted. This procedure was repeated twice to provide the peptides as colorless solids. The crude peptides were dissolved in water/acetonitrile and purified using either a Waters XTerraMS CI 8 preparative-HPLC column (50 mm x 19 mm, 5 micron particle size, 120Apore size) or a Waters-YMC CI 8 ODS column (250 mm x 30 mm i.d., 10 micron particle size. 120 A pore size). The fractions with the products were collected and analyzed by FIPLC. The fractions with &gt;95% purity were pooled and the peptides isolated by Ivonhilization. .<br><br>

IN VITRO AND IN VIVO TESTING OF COMPOUNDS<br>
Example XLIII: In vitro Binding Assay for GRP Receptors in PC3 Cell Lines -<br>
Figures 14 A-B<br>
[0228]    To identify potential lead compounds, an in vitro assay that identifies compounds with high affinity for GRP-R was used. Since the PC3 cell line, derived from human prostate cancer, is known to exhibit high expression of GRP-R on the cell surface, a radio ligand binding assay in a 96-well plate format was developed and validated to measure the binding of;" I-BBN to GRP-R positive PC3 cells and the ability of the compounds of the invention to inhibit this binding. This assay was used to measure the IC50 for RP527 ligand, LI 34 ligand (controls) and compounds of the invention which inhibit the binding of ^ I-BBN to GRP-R. (RP527 =N,N-dimethylglycine-Ser-Cys(Acm)-Gly-5-aminopemanoic acid-BBN (7-14) [SEQ. ID.NO: 1], which has MS = 1442.6 and IC50 - 0.84).

[0229]    The Radioligand Binding Plate Assay was validated for BBN and BBN analogues (including commercially available BBN and LI) and also using   mTc RP527 as the radioligand,<br>
A.        Materials and Method:<br>
1.	Cell culture:<br>
PC3 (human prostate cancer cell line) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in RPMI 1640 in tissue culture flasks (Corning). This growth medium was supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FBS (Hyclone, SH30070.03), 10 mM HEPES (GibcoBRL, 15630-080), and antibiotic/antimycotic (GibcoBRL, 15240-062) for a final concentration of penicillin-streptomycin (100 units/mL), and fungizone (0.25 jig/mL). All cultures were maintained in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% C02/95% air at 37°C, and passaged routinely using 0.05% trypsin/EDTA (GibcoBRL 25300-054) where indicated. Cells for experiments were nlated at a concentration of 2.0x10" /well either \r.<br><br>
96-well white /clear bottom microtiter plates (Falcon Optilux-I) or 96 weil black/clear collagen I cellware plates (Bccktor. Dickinson Biocoat). Plates were used for binding studies on day 1 or 2 post-plaiing.<br>
2.	Binding buffer:<br>
RPMI.1640 supplemented with 20mM HEPES, 0.1H BSA (w/v), 0.5 mM PMSF (AEBSF), bacitracin (50 mg/500 ml): pH 7.4.<br>
U:I-BBN (carrier free, 2200 Ci/mmole) was obtained from Perkin-Elmer.<br>
B.        Competition assay with i:5I-BBN for GRP-R in PC3 cells:<br>
A 96-well plate assay was used to determine the IC50 of various compounds of the invention to inhibit binding of 12:,I-BBN to human GRP-R. The following general procedure was followed:<br>
All compounds tested were dissolved in binding buffer and appropriate dilutions were also done in binding buffer. PC3 cells (human prostate cancer cell line) for assay were plated at a concentration of 2.0x10 /well either in 96-well white /clear bottomed microtiter plates (Falcon Optilux-I) or 96 well black/clear collagen I cellware plates (Beckton Dickinson Biocoat). Plates were used for binding studies on day 1 or 2 post-plating. The plates were checked for confluency (&gt;90% confluent) prior to assay.   For the assay, RP527 or LI 34 ligand, (controls), or compounds of the invention at concentrations ranging from 1.25x10~9M to 5x10" M, was co-incubated with<br>
I-BBN (25,000 cpm/well). These studies were conducted with an assay volume of 75 \x\ per well. Triplicate wells were used for each data point. After the addition of the appropriate solutions, plates were incubated for 1 h at 4°C to prevent internalization of the ligand-receptor complex. Incubation was ended by the addition of 200 \x\ of ice-cold incubation buffer. Plates were washed 5 tines and blotted dry. Radioactivity was detected using either the LKB CompuGamma counter or a microplate scintillation counter.<br>
[0230]    Competition binding curves for RP527 (control) and L70, a mpound of the im-ention can be found in Figures 14A-B These data show that the IC50 of<br><br>
of the LI 34 control was 5nM.   IC50 values for those compounds of the invention tested can be found in Tables  1-3, sugra, and show that they are comparable to that of the controls and thus would be expected to have sufficient affinity for the receptor to allow uptake by receptor bearing cells in vivo.<br>
C.        Internalization &amp; Efflux assay:<br>
These studies were conducted in a 96-well plate . After washing to remove serum proteins, PC3 cells were incubated with 1OI-BBN. I"Lu-L134 or radiolabeled compounds of this invention for 40 mm, at 37 °C. Incubations were stopped by the addition of 200 jil of ice-cold binding buffer. Plates were washed twice with binding buffer. To remove surface-bound radioligand, the cells were incubated with 0.2M acetic acid (in saline), pH 2.8 for 2 min. Plates were centrifuged and the acid wash media were collected to determine the amount of radioactivity which was not internalized. The ceils were collected to determine the amount of internalized  " I-BBN, and all samples were analyzed in the gamma counter. Data for the internalization assay was normalized by comparing counts obtained at the various time points with the counts obtained at the final time point (T40 min).<br>
For the efflux studies, after loading the PC3 cells with 123I-BBN or radiolabeled compounds of the invention for 40 min at 37°c, the unbound material was washed off, and the % of internalization was determined as above. The cells were then resuspended in binding buffer at 37°C for up to 3h At   0.5, 1,2, or 3 h. the amount remaining internalized relative to the initial loading level was determined as above and used to calculate the percent efflux recorded in Table 5.<br>

Fxample LIII - In vivo Pharmacokinetic Studies<br>
A.        Tracer dose biodistribution:<br>
Low dose pharmacokinetic studies (e.g., biodistribution studies) were performed using the below-identified compounds of the invention in xenografted, ?C3 tumor-bearing nude mice ([Ncr]-Foxnl<nu>). In all studies, mice were administered 100 jiL of l77Lu-labelled test compound at 200 jiCi/kg, I.v., with a residence time of 1 and 24 h per group (n=3-4). Tissues were analyzed in an LKB 1282 CompuGamma counter with appropriate standards.<br><br>

[0245]    Pharmacokinetic comparison at 1 and 24 h in PC3 tumor-bearing nude mice<br>
(200 jiCi/kg; values as % ID/g) of Lu-177 labelled compounds of this invention compared to control<br><br>
[0246]    Whereas the distribution of radioactivity in the blood, liver and kidneys after injection of L64 and L70 is similar to that of the control compound, LI 34, the uptake in the tumor is much higher at 1 and 24 h for both L64 and L70. L63 also shows high tumour uptake although with increased blood and liver values at early times. Uptake iri fhe mouse pancreas, a normal organ known to have GRP receptors is much higher for L64, L70 and L63 than for L134.<br>
Example LIV-Receptor Subtype Specificity<br>
Currently, four mammalian members of the GRP receptor family are known: the GRP-preferring receptor (GRP-R), neuromedin-B preferring receptor (NMB-R), the bombesin receptor subtype 3 (BB3-R) and the BB4 receptor subtype. The receptor subtype specificity of    Lu-L245 was investigated. The results indicate      Lu-L245 binds specifically to GRP-R and NMB-R, and has little affinity for BB3-R.<br>
1 77<br>
The subtype specificity of the Lutetium complex of L245 [    Lu-L24] (prepared as described supra) was determined by in vitro receptor autoradiography using the procedure described in Reubi et ah, "Bombesin Preceptor Subtypes in Human Cancers: Detection with the Universal Radioligand (125)I-[D-TYR(6), beta-ALA, PHE(13), NLE(14)] Bombesin (6-14)", Clin.Cancer Res. 8:1139-1146 (2002) and tissue samples that had been previously found to express only one subtype of GRP receptor. Human ileal carcinoid tissue was used as a source for NMB-R, human prostate carcinoma for GRP-R and human bronchial carcinoid for BB3-R subtype receptors. A compound known as the Universal ligand,   " I-[DTyr , BAla" ; Hhe   ,<br><br>
Nle14]-BBN(6-14), which binds to all three subsets of GRP-R; was used as a positive control. The following results were seen.<br>
Table 8<br>
Receptor Subtype Specificity of' Lu-L245 as Measured by Competition Assay with Universal Ligand on Hunan Tissue Samples<br><br>
These results indicate that L245 derivatives are expected to bind well to human prostate carcinoma, which primarily expresses GRP-R. They also indicate that L245 derivatives are not expected to bind well to normal human pancreas (which primarily expresses the BB3-R receptor), or to cancers which primarily express the BB3-R receptor subtype.<br>
Example LV - Radiotherapy Studies<br>
A.        Short Term Efficacy Studies:<br>
Radiotherapy studies were performed using the PC3 tumor-bearing nude mouse model. Lu-177 labelled compounds of the invention L64, L70, L63 and the treatment control compound L134 were compared to an untreated control group. (n=12 for each treatment group and n=36 for the untreated control<br>

group). For the first study, mice were administered 100 uL of    Lu-kbelled compound of the invention at 30 mCi/kg, i.v, or s.c. -under sterile conditions. The subjects were housed in a barrier environment for up to 30 days. Body weight and xumor size (by caliper measurement) were collected on each subject 3 times per week for the duration of the study. Criteria for early termination included: death; loss of total body weight (TBW) e;qual to or greater than 20%; tumor size equal to or greater than 2 cmv. Results are displayed in Figure 15A. These results show that animals treated with L70, L64 or L63 have increased survival over the control animals given no treatment and over those animals given the same dose of LI 34.<br><br>
A repeat study was performed with L64 and L70 using the same dose as before but using more animals per compound (n=46) and following them for longer. The results of the repeat study are displayed in Figure 15B. Relative to the same controls as before (n=36), both L64 and L70 treatment give significantly increased survival (p

Alternative Preparation of L64 and L70 Using Segment Coupling<br>
[0247]    Compounds L64 and L70 can be prepared employing the collection of intermediates generally represented by A-D (Figure 19), which themselves are prepared by standard methods known in the art of solid and solution phase peptide synthesis (Synthetic Peptides - A User's Guide  1992, Grant, G., Ed. WH. Freeman Co., NY, Chap 3 and Chap 4 pp 77 - 25S; Chan, W.C. and White, P.D. Basic Procedures in Fmoc Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis - A Practical Approach 2002, Chan, W.C. and White, P.D. Eds Oxford University Press, New York, Chap, j pp 41 - 76; Barlos, K and Gatos, G.

Eds Oxford University Press, New York, Chap. 9 pp 216 - 22S.) which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0248]    These methods include Aloe, Boc, Fmoc or benzyloxycarbonyl-based peptide synthesis strategies or judiciously chosen combinations of those methods on solid phase or in solution. The intermediates to be employed for a given step are chosen based on the selection of appropriate protecting groups for each position in the molecule, which may be selected from the list cf groups shown in Figure 1. Those of ordinary skill in the art will also understand that intermediates, compatible with peptide synthesis methodology, comprised of alternative protecting groups can also be employed and that the listed options for protecting groups shown above serves as illustrative and not inclusive, and that such alternatives are well known in the art.<br>
* [0249] This is amply illustrated in Figure 20 which outlines the approach. Substitution of the intermediate C2 in place of CI shown in the synthesis of L64, provides L70 when the same synthetic strategies are applied.<br><br>
