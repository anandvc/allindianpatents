of.<br>
Chaudhry Om Singh<br>
E1/44, Arera colony,<br>
Bhopal 462016,<br>
M.P.<br>
.An Indian National<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner  in which it is to be performed.<br>
GRANTED                       17 DEC 2004  <br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to a system for transferring porous granulated powdery material, especially alumina in hyper dense phase mode through air slides having zero or less than one degree inclination. This invention is also about potential fluidisation &amp; the manner in which it is performed at very low pressure.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Systems conventionally used in industry for filling alumina in pot hoppers<br>
are<br>
Over head crane and bucket and Rare phase, a high pressure system,<br>
transporting alumina at high pressure.<br>
Over head crane and bucket is the standard alumina feeding system in most of the smelter. This system is inherently environment non friendly. There is loss of alumina due to dusting typically .02 ton of alumina per ton of metal. There is also heavy dependency and heavy usage of over head cranes for charging alumina particularly after a break down.<br>
Rare phase, a high-pressure system is generally known as pipe in pipe system. This system transfers alumina at 4-5 kg/cm2. Trere are again requirement of air compressors, special switching valves, higher instrumentations and result in higher capital costs. Again due to high speed of transfer Lumina attrition is high, thus adversely effecting smelter operating efficiency. The maintenance costs of this system are high. The wear and tear of the pipelines, used for alumina transfer, is high. As high-pressure air is used for conveying, the operating cost of the system is also high.<br>
Conventional Fluidisation<br>
Granular porous materials like Alumina can only slide on the surfaces having inclination more than their Angle of Repose. But if Alumina is fluidised with 3 to 5 Kg / square centimetre pressure, it can slide even at lower angle and conventionally on the surfaces having 7 to 10 degree inclination. In this system air is used to reduce the coefficient of friction between Alumina particles so that Angle Of Repose is reduced and<br><br><br>
Alumina slides at 7 to 10 inclined surface instead of at originally 35 to 37 degree.<br>
This system is used in industry for transferring Alumina at short distances of 10 to 20 Meters. The drawback in the above mentioned system is that this system cannot be used for transferring Alumina at distance of 300 to 500 meters, as it will require a gradient of 35 to 60 meters, which is not viable as well as feasible in running plants.<br>
Potential Fluidisation<br>
Angle of repose is a function of friction between two particles. It can be reduced by smoothing the particles surface or by providing lubrication. Alumina particle being highly porous, adsorb air at its surface, acquiring bouncy / air cushioning / fluidization. With fluidization, friction between the two particles reduces on account of air cushioning. With special/potential fluidization friction becomes zero, alumina behaves like a fluid and follows some of the fluid characteristics. On removing air it acquires its original angle of repose.<br>
In Potential Fluidization, Alumina is fluidised with very low pressure and high volume air so that entire porosity of each and every particle is filled with air. A loss weight situation is created, Particles starts floating in air. Quantity of air is optimised, creating mushy, cloudy hyper dense mass of Alumina. This mushy hyper dense mass of Alumina behaves somewhat like fluid and starts moving towards low pressure anywhere in the system. Once the particles start floating, Angle Of Repose has no relevance. Alumina can move at zero inclination.<br><br><br>
OBJECTIVE OF THE INVENTION:<br>
It is an object of the invention to obviate the drawbacks in the above-mentioned transferring system.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a system where in the alumina is fluidised with very low pressure (.075 to .10 kg/cm2) and high volume air so that entire porosity of each and every particle is filled with air, a loss weight situation is created and particles start floating in air and starts moving towards low pressure anywhere in the system.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a system where in   angle Of repose has no relevance even alumina can move at zero inclination.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a system where there is virtually no attrition of alumina during transfer.<br>
It is yet another object of the invention to provide a system where capital cost, maintenance cost and operating cost are minimum.<br>
It is still another object of the invention to provide a method of transferring Alumina in hyper dense phase mode through air slides having zero or less than one degree inclination.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
In order to achieve the above objectives and others, the present invention provides a system for transferring porous granulated powdery material, especially alumina in hyper dense phase mode through air slides having zero or less than one degree inclination comprising a discharging means, one or more air slides in fluid connection with the said discharging means, a fluidising media with particular air permeability dividing the said air slide into two chambers, the upper chamber having arrangements to receive and discharge the alumina, the lower chamber having connection for supply of high volume low pressure air, a balancing / dedusting column including a bag house and a fan connected to the said upper chamber for regulating the air flow through air slide, a low pressure high volume air supply pipe line connected to the said lower chamber to provide more or<br><br><br>
less equal pressure over the entire length of the air slide and a receiving means at a lower level to that of feeding point of alumina to air slide to collect alumina.<br>
The discharging means can be silo, hopper bin or a storage tank having sufficient alumina, so that when connected to air slide, the pressure in the air slide shall not be able to bleed through alumina container, what so ever kind of container it may be.<br>
The air slide can be of any shape, size and length depending upon the quantum and distance of the alumina to be transferred.<br>
The air slide can be of one of the shapes selected from round, square, oblong, elliptical and polygonal.<br>
The air slide is a mild steel fabricated enclosed structure.<br>
The air slide can also be provided with glass window for observing the movement of alumina.<br>
Where there is plurality of air slides, they can be arranged in one row or in multiple rows one above the other.<br>
Generally a vibrating screen is disposed between the discharging means and the air slide to separate any foreign material finding its way to air slides.<br>
The fluidising media is a thick fabric specially produced for particular air permeability or a powdered sintered plate or a composite of pinhole perforated sheet.<br>
The balancing column is of any shape and size till it balances the weight of fluidised floating mass against the air pressure in alumina chamber and does not allow alumina to go to dedusting bag house.<br>
The balancing column is one of the shapes selected from round, square, oblong, elliptical and polygonal.<br><br><br>

The air pressure and volume regulating of air flow can also be controlled by PLC.<br>
The receiving means is of any shape and size.<br>
The receiving means can also be a chute feeding to an elevator or air slide.<br>
This invention also provides a method of transferring porous granulated powdery material, especially alumina in hyper dense phase mode through air slides having zero or less than one degree inclination, which comprises the steps of discharging the alumina into a air slide, fluidising the said alumina with low pressure and high volume air to make it hyper dense and mushy within the said air slide and collecting the said hyper dense and mushy alumina in a receiving means.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the air slide in turn connected in series with plurality of air slides each having independent balancing column covering the entire length of the building.<br>
In yet another embodiment of present invention, the air pressure and volume regulating of air flow is controlled by PLC<br>
