				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a device for guiding yam for a spinning frame especially in a ring spinning frame.<br>
In ring spinning frames generally a rail, also being called ring rail, is arranged extending in longitudinal direction, said rail, which by means of traction elements, usually via a belt pulley, is being connected with a gear, whereat the traction elements are led over deviations and which over part of their path, are being guided in horizontal-longitudinal direction of the frame and transverse to it.<br>
From the DE Al 43 43 966 for instance a driving device for a ring rail of a ring spinning frame is known whereat the ring rail is being connected via traction elements with a driving device. For such a solution it is of advantage to employ springs to pull the ring rail downward in order to keep the traction elements always tensioned tightly and that during each state of movement a reliable guidance of the ring rail may be ensured. It is to be considered disadvantageous, that due to the numerous elements being employed in the transmission mechanism, the assembly expenditure as well as the time needed for maintenance are extremely high.<br>
It is the task of the present invention to provide a device according to the preamble of the first claim, by which as few driving elements as possible are being applied to achieve an exact control of the movement.<br>
Said task is being solved by a device with the characteristics of the independent claim. The depending claims relate to preferred further embodiments.<br>
In a device for guiding yarn according to the invention a transmission element is being applied to carry out a back and forth translatorical preferably vertical movement, whereat for the actuation of the transmission element a traction element is being provided    which    is    guided    transverse   to    the   transmission     element,    and<br><br>
whereat for the transmission of motion at least one, preferably several connecting rods are being connected at the transmission element and at the traction element. For a swivelling element at the connecting rod or for the traction element itself a drive unit is being provided. The traction element can for instance be furnished as a spindle being shiftable in longitudinal direction or as a spindle nut on a spindle which is non-shiftable in longitudinal direction.<br>
If a flexible type traction element is being employed, it can envelop a swivel element which acts on the connecting rod. It can be of advantage to provide for a design that the turning direction i.e. swivel direction of several swivel elements is counter clockwise, wherefor between one swivel element and a further swivel element at least one deviation element is being arranged in such a way that the swivel elements perform counter motions. For that case a swivel element and an additional swivel element are designed as circular parts, so that a traction element can be led around the circumferences of said elements. One end of a respective connecting rod is being pivotally connected to a swivelling element. The device for guiding yarn or a transmission element as part of it can, if applicable, be connected with a ring rail by a pushing rod, which are being supported in a guide. A drive unit consisting of a motor with a transmission gear is positively connected with a traction element, which preferably is being furnished as a threaded spindle which is non-shiftable in longitudinal direction, whereat threaded sleeves, being shiftable along the threaded spindle, as swivel elements being connected with connecting rods, are being rotatable against each other. At the other end of the connecting rod a transmission element is connected, whereat between each connecting rod and a swivel element i.e. traction element and a connecting rod a pivot bearing is being provided. At one end the swivel element can also be provided with a stationary pivotal, while at the other end, in connection with the connecting rod, it has a shiftable pivotal.<br>
The swivel element can comprise a longitudinal guide extending parallel to a traction element, in particular in form of a threaded sleeve on a spindle. The connecting rods are either driven in one and the same direction or in counter, i.e. mirror inverted<br><br>
direction.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a device for guiding yarn for a spinning frame, characterized in that a transmission element of the device is movable translatorically in order to carry out a reciprocating movement and that for actuation of transmission element a traction element is being provided, which is guided transverse to the transmission element, whereat for the transmission of movement a connecting rod is being furnished to connect the transmission element and the traction element.<br>
In the following the invention is being described in more detail according to the drawing, wherein shows:<br>
Fig. 1	a device for guiding yam in two variants of embodiments of the drive<br>
elements and<br>
Fig. 2	a further exemplified embodiment in schematic view.<br>
A transmission element 18 of the device can be connected with a ring rail 12 through pushing rods 14, which in particular are being guided vertically by way of a second guide 16. However, also a solution can be chosen, whereat the transmission element 18 and the ring rail 12 consist of one and same machine element. In this case said element is also to be supported by a suitable guide similar to the second guide 16 with the pushing rods 14, so that the device can carry out translatoric movements. At the transmission element 18 connecting rods 21 and 23 of a first transmission mechanism<br><br>
or connecting rods 22 or other connecting rods 22, 24 of a second transmission mechanism are being connected. In the first case a first swivel element 31 is connected to a connecting rod 21, fiirther, to at least one third connecting rod 23 a third swivel element 43. Thereby the first and the third swivel elements 41 and 43 at one end are supported stationary but swivelable. A traction element 31, preferably furnished as a threaded spindle, engages at one end, opposite the transmission element 18, with the first connecting rod 21 i.e. the third connecting rod 23, whereat between the traction element 31, in the form of a spindle, and the connecting rod 21 or the third connecting rod 23, preferably a threaded sleeve is being provided. The traction element is being moved through a first guide 31c in longitudinal direction of the spinning frame. Alternatively the transmission element 18 or the ring rail 12 can also be moved by a second or fourth connecting rod 22, 24, 25, whereat a second and a fourth diverting element 42, 44, basically are being designed as circular discs with a drive unit 50. Around the circumference of the swivel elements 42 and 44 a traction element 32 is led whereat it is suitable to provide a positively connected drive. For this the traction element 32 is an endless element which is being led over both swivel elements 42, 44. Ifthe traction element<br><br>
being routed via two diverting rollers 33, 34 is being diverted each from the top downwards i.e. from the bottom upwards, the swivel elements 42, 44 can be moved circularly in counter beat, whereby also the second connecting rod 22 and the fifth connecting rod 25 according to figure 1 can carry out movements which are mirror inverted to each other. The arrows between the second swivel element 42 and the fourth swivel element 44 show the movement of the traction element in the various sections. If the left swivel element 42 is turned in clockwise direction, according to arrow 32 and if swivel elements 33 and 34 are being provided, then this leads to a turning movement of the fourth swivel element 44 according to the arrow next to the numeral 34. The second connecting rod 22 and the fifth connecting rod are then moving towards each other, whereat respective longitudinally acting forces within the transmission element 18 counterbalance each other and whereby merely resulting vertical forces parallel to the pushing rods 14 occur.<br>
An other exemplified embodiment is shown in figure 2, whereat preferably in the middle of a traction element 35 a motor 50 with a transmission gear 51 provides turning movement for the traction element 35. The left and right ends each of the traction element 35 are being provided with threaded sections with a pitch being cut in such a way that the swivel element 46 and 48 each with inside thread, simultaneously move towards and away from each other. Thereby the connecting rod 21 and 23, which at one end are connected to the transmission element and at the other end to the swivel element 46, i.e. 48, carry out a shifting movement at the transmission element 18. It is suitable to arrange guides 31b in longitudinal direction of the traction element 35 within the range of the swivel elements 46 and 48. In this exemplified embodiment the longitudinal forces are also counterbalanced to each other by the first connecting rod 21 i.e. the third connecting rod 23 within the transmission element 18, so that the guides 16 practically do not bear transversal forces of the connecting rods.<br>
Figure 3 relates to a similar exemplified embodiment as figure 1, however with the difference that additionally to the first device for guiding yarn 10, a second chain<br><br>
dotted device 10a is shown schematically, with basically identical parts corresponding to the first device for guiding yarn 10. The drive unit 50 can be designed in such a way, that additionally to the first swivel elennent 42, for instance in the form of a disc with a traction element guided on it, a further swivel element 42a can be driven, which is being supported on a common axis with the first swivel element 42. A traction element 47a, for instance being furnished as belt or rope is being connected via a deviation roller 49a to the horizontally shiftably supported traction element 31a. The traction elements 31 and 31a are arranged in staggered manner within the lower part of the spinning frame. In a double sided spinning frame having a row of spinning units on both longitudinal sides, then there are two traction elements 31 each of the first device guiding yarn 10 and two further traction elements 31a of the second device being provided. The latter can for instance be utilised for transport tasks within the spinning frame. The drive unit 50 can be switched from the first device of the yarn guide 10 to the second arrangement 10a i.e. vice versa, in that a coupling element alternatingly connects the first device 10 or the second device 10a with the drive unit 50. As described above, the horizontal movement of the traction element 31a is being transmitted onto a connecting rod 21a, which is connected to a swivel element 41a. The lower end of the swivel element 41a is stationarily arranged in a pivot bearing in the spinning frame as is customary in ring spinning frames. Since the length of the swivel element 41a, i.e. 41 is the same as the upper partial length of the connecting rod 21a, i.e. 21, during horizontal movement of the traction elements 31, i.e. 31a an exclusive vertical movement of the transmission element 18a, i.e. 18 results. It is understood that in the described configuration the device 10 and 10a can only be operated alternatingly.<br>
Spring elements being fastened on the traction element 31 acting against the forces of gravity of the device, that is in the direction of the arrow near 41 in figure 1 can contribute to a considerable load reduction on the motor 50.<br><br>
With the shown exemplified embodiments the shifting mechanism for the device for the guiding yarn can thus be designed cost effective and robust.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
