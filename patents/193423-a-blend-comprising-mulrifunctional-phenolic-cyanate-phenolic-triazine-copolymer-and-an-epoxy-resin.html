				<td>This invention relates to certain novel blends of phenolic cyanate-phenolic triazine copolymers and epoxy resins, as vk^ell as to articles preparec from said blends. More particularly, this invention relates to such blends which have improved properties.<br>
2. Prior Art<br>
Phenolic resins are a class of synthetic materials which greatly vary in molecular structure. Therefore, a multitude of applications for these products exists as a result of the array of physical properties that arise from the synthetic options. However, phenolics disadvantageously exhibit less than desirable thermal oxidative stability and produce an extensive, uncontrollable amount of volatile by-products during crosslinking.<br>
In order to obviate certain of the disadvantages attendant to phenolics, U.S. Patent No. 4,970,276 proposed a modified multifunctional phenolic cyanate/phenolic thazine copolymer ("PT resin") which had greater oxidative, mechanical, and thermal stability as compared to conventional phenolic resins, and did not produce volatile by-products during crosslinking. Further, these PT resins possessed better elongation properties and higher glass transition temperatures than the conventional phenolic resins. Additional examples of such PT resins are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,970,276, 4,978,727. and 5,126,412.<br>
Another approach for producing thermosettable blends having<br>
mproved mechanical properties is by blending dicyanate esters with epoxy<br>
esins as disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,612,359, 4,506,603, 4,477,629,<br>
1,546,131, 4,487,915, 3,562,214 and in Shimo. et al   "r.r^-o^^r^:	*<br><br>

May, 1991). These blends lave been useful in the production of base materials for printed circuits as lisciosed in Patent Nos. DE 4022255, DO 290844, DE 4125420, and DE 224835.<br>

It would be desirable to provide a thermosettable resin blend which, len cured, is superior to prior art phenolic resins and dicyanate blends in e or more of the properties selected from glass transition temperature, xural strength, flexural modulus, elongation, and water absorption.<br><br><br><br>

Methods for producing reinforced and/or filled blends include melt blending, extrusion and molding processes, simple mixing and dispersion of both materials in suitable medium by methods known in the art.<br>
For coloring purposes, a curable resin blend of this invention may include white pigments such as titanium dioxide, and coloring pigments or various organic dyes and pigments, such as lead yellow, carbon black, iron black, molybdenium red, prussian blue, navy blue, cadmium yellow, and cadmium red.<br>
The curable resin blends of the present invention may be prepared by either a wet process or a dry process, both of which are conventionally known in the art. Choice of the process is determined by the proportion of components and final use of the blend.<br>
In the wet process, each component is individually dissolved in a solvent, then all of the components are blended so as to obtain a curable resin blend having the desired proportion; Alternatively, at least one of the components is dissolved in a solvent, and the other components are added thereto. In view of the high viscosity of both the PT resin and epoxy, it is preferred that, when selecting the latter embodiment, at least these two components are initially dissolved in a solvent before other components are added thereto. Otherwise, it may be necessary to heat the PT resin-epoxy mixture to temperatures ranging from'about 65" C to about 75 "C in order to lower the viscosity and improve the mixing thereof, and thus reduce the likelihood of non-uniformities in the end product.<br>
The blends prepared according to the wet process contain a solvent or solvents. The solvent may be removed by heating the blend or by keeping the blend under a reduced pressure.<br><br>
Solvents suitable for dissolving the components employed in the wet process include, for example, ketones, such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, and the like, as well as tetrahydrofuran, methylene chloride, dimethylformamide,1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone , and the like.<br>
According to the dry process, the PT resin and epoxy resin components are continuously mixed via conventional means at temperatures of about 65 **C to about 75 "C until homogeneous. An effective amount of a solution comprised of from about 15 to about 25 percent, based upon the total weight of the solution, of catalyst predissolved in an alkyl phenol solvent, such as nonylphenol, dodecylphenol, o-cresol, 2-sec.butylphenol and 2,6-dinonylphenol, most preferably nonylphenol, may optionally be added thereto such that the amount of catalyst in the homogenously blended blend is from about 0.06 to about 0.07 percent, based upon the total weight of the blend. The resulting blend is continuously stirred for about 20 minutes to about 1 hour until homogeneous.<br>
Further details regarding both the wet process and the dry process are described in "Formulating with Dow Epoxy resins Electrical Laminates' by the Dow Chemical Company (Feb. 19S0).<br>
The method of curing the resin blend of this invention is not restricted in particular. Usually it is performed by heating. Generally a temperature of about 18 "C to about 400 "C, preferably a temperature of about 100 °C to about 300 ®C., is selected. The time required for curing differs depending upon the form in which the resin blend of this invention is used, i.e. depending upon whether it is a thin film, or a relatively thick molded article or laminate. Usually, a period sufficient for curing the resin may be selected from the range of from about 1 hour to about 2 hours. When the resin blend of this invention is to be used in molded articles, such as those produced via resin transfer molding, compression molding, injection molding, and the like, laminates or bonded stmctures, it is desirable to apply pressure during the heat curing mentioned above.<br>
Other curing methods involve use of microwave, radio frequency, ionizing radiation, electron beams from various types of accelerators, gamma-<br><br>
rays from isotopes such as cobalt 60, sunlight, and active energy, for example, light radiated from a light source such as tungsten lamp, or a low-pressure or high-pressure mercury lamp. In the case of photocuring, the resin blend of this invention may contain up to 5 percent, based upon the total weight of the blend, of a known photosensitizer, for example, an organic carbonyl compound such as benzoin, benzoin methyl ether, benzathrone, anthraquinone and benzophenone, or a combination of a sensitizing dye such as eosine, erythrosine or acridine with a amine. Such a photocurable resin blemd containing a photosensitizer is effective in coating applications.<br>
The blends of the present invention are preferably employed to prepare articles including, but not limited to, composites and laminates i.e. electrical laminates such as printed circuit boards or rigid substrates suitable for the production of printed circuits boards. In preparing the boards, one or more plies, preferably about 4 to 8 plies of a fibrous substrate are coated and/or impregnated with the blend of the present invention and laminated. Conventional coating equipment can be employed. Subsequent to coating and/or impregnating or laminating the substrate is cured at a temperature of about 100°C to about 3000C for about 1 hour to about 2 hours to form a rigid substrate. The blends can be used to coat and/or impregnate fibrous substrates such as fiberglass, nylon, paper such as that obtainable from DuPont under the tradename "Thermounf, polyimides, graphite, and the like. The substrate can be in the form of woven fabric, mat, monofilament, multifilament rovings, and the like.<br><br>
The ratio of the blend of the present invention to the substrate in a prepreg may vary from based upon the total weight of the preimpregnated substrate or "prepreg", about 20:80 to about 50:50, and preferably from about 35:65 to about 40:60. As used herein "prepreg" shall refer to the substrate coated with the uncured resin blend of the present invention.<br>
After the rigid substrate is formed, at least one ply, preferably 1 to about 2 piles, of a sheet of copper or other electrically conductive material, e.g. gold, silver, aluminum and the like, can then be laminated to the rigid substrate using laminating conditions such as pressure of about 0.34 Mpa to about 2.76 Mpa and temperatures of about 50^C<br><br>
to about 300 °C applied for about 30 to about 300 minutes. Then a circuit can be etched into the conductive layer using techniques well-known to form circuit boards.<br>
The following non-limiting examples are presented to further illustrate the present invention.<br>
