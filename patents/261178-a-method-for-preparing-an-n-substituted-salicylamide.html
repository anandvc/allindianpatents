				<td>Manufacture Process of Organic Compounds<br>
The present invention relates to a method of preparing N-'substituted salicylamides or derivatives thereof and their derivatives, e.g. their salts. In particular, the present invention relates to a method of preparing (N:(5-chlorosalicy!cyl)-8-aminocaprylic acid (5-CNAC) and its corresponding disodium monohydrate.<br>
The N-substituted salicylamides as prepared by the method of the present invention are suitable for use in compositions for delivering active agents via oral or other routes of administration to mammals.<br>
BACKGROUND TO INVENTION<br>
Processes for preparing N-substituted salicylamides are known such as that shown in Scheme 1.<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
The oligosalicylate is obtained from the corresponding salicylic acid upon treatment with acetic anhydride. Coupling of the amino acid is promoted with a base, preferably potassium carbonate in a suitable solvent (like dioxane). Yields are generally in the order of 50 %.<br>
An exemplary compound synthesised by this prior art process is 5-CNAC, which is commonly used as a delivery agent for therapeutic agents and is used in pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention provides, amongst other things, a method for making N-substituted salicylamides in which a salicylic acid or a salicylic acid whose carboxy group is derivatised, for example an ester or a derivative comprising a peptide coupling agent, in any event unprotected at its phenolic hydroxy group, is reacted with an amine under basic conditions, i.e. conditions in which at least a proportion of the phenolic hydroxy group is deprotonated, in an aprotic solvent, e.g. DMF (dimethylformamide). The carboxy group of the starting salicylic acid is typically esterified or otherwise derivatised, e.g. activated.<br>
The invention further provides a method for making a salt of an N-substituted salicylamide, where an N-substituted salicyfamide is contacted with a base, e.g. an alkali metal base, for example by contacting the salicylamide with a basic aqueous solution containing an alkali metal (or other) cation. Normally the aqueous solution comprises an acetone/water mixture.<br>
In particular, the present invention relates to a method of preparing (N-(5-chlorosalicyloyl)-8-aminocaprylic acid (5-CNAC) and its saits, notably its corresponding disodium monohydrate. The method comprises reacting methyl-5-chloro-salicylate with amino-octanoic acid (or derivative thereof, for example amino-octane-nitrile) under basic conditions in an aprotic solvent, e.g. dimethylformarhide. The basic conditions may be created by pre-reacting the methyl-5-chloro-salicylate with a base such as, for example, an alcoholate, e.g. NaOMe, or by including the base in the reaction mixture. The disodium monohydrate salt may be formed by reacting the 5-CNAC with NaOH in an acetone/water mixture.<br>
The N-substituted salicyiamides, especially 5-CNAC, as prepared by the method of the present invention are suitable for use in compositions for delivering active agents via oral or other routes of administration to mammals. The method may therefore further comprise incorporating the salicylamide, whether as free acid, ester or salt, into a pharmaceutical composition containing also an active agent. The composition typically contains a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or excipient as well as an active agent.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates in embodiments to a method of preparing N-substituted salicylamides or derivatives thereof and their salts from the corresponding unÂ¬protected salicylic acid ester as shown in Scheme 2. The phenolic hydroxy group is unprotected. The carboxy group of the acid may be in the form of the free acid, but usually it is derivatised, e.g. esterified or activated as illustrated in Scheme 2:<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
The species of formula (I') may be formed by deprotonation of compounds of formula (I) below by reaction with a base. The base may be an alcoholate, for example an alkali metal alcoholate, such as, e.g. alkoxide., Species of formula (I') may be formed<br><br>
prior to step A, or may be formed in situ during step A by including a base in the salicylate/amino acid/DMF reaction mixture.<br>
The source of species of formula (I') may therefore be a preformed salt, for example in the.case that the base is an alkali metal alcoholate, then the compound of formula (I') may be in the form of the alkali metal salt; for example if NaOMe were used, then the compound of formula (V) may be in the form, fully or partially, of the sodium salt. In an alternative set of compounds, compounds of formula (I') may be in the form of other salts, such as an ammonium salt. The deprotonation step is exemplified in Scheme 4:<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
Step B may be a single step reaction, involving acid work up of a compound in whichR7 is a carboxyl group. In other cases, R7 must be converted into a carboxyl group, for example by hydrolysis of a nitrile group; in this instance, step B comprises the conversion reaction and, if appropriate, a subsequent work up to the acid. Thus, embodiments are shown in reaction schemes B1 and B2:<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
Scheme B1 illustrates a class of reactions where compound (III) can be converted to compound (IV) by treating it with acid, as in the case where R7 comprises carboxyl groups in the form of.a salt<br>
Scheme B2 illustrates a class of reactions where R7 is converted to a carboxy group by base hydrolysis, as for example in the case of a nitrile group. After the hydrolysis is performed, the base is contacted with an acid to convert the carboxly groups into the acid form.<br>
The reaction steps A, B and C, although shown in sequence, may be carried out independently of one another, especially step C.<br>
In the above schemes, the symbols have the following meanings:<br>
n is from 1 to 8, preferably n is 6;<br>
m is from 1 to 4, preferably m is 1;<br>
R1 is an ester-forming group, e.g. a linear or branched alkyl containing 1,2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 carbon atoms, halogen, or other carboxy activating group such as, for example, hydroxysuccinamidyl; hydroxysuccinimidyl or pentaf luorophenyl or any peptide coupling reagent such as, for example, carbonyl diimidazol, dicyclihexyl carbodiimide, phosphoric anhydride; and<br>
the or each R2 may be independently selected from -OH, NR3R4, halogen, C1, C2, C3 or C4 alkyl, C1,C2,C3 or C4 haloalkyl, C1, C2, C3 or C4 alkoxy, C1, C2, C3 or C4 alkenyl; and<br>
the or each R5 and each R6 are independently selected from hydrogen, -OH, NR3R4, halogen, d, C2, C3 or C4 alkyl, C1, C2, C3 or C4 alkoxy, C1, C2, C3 or C4 alkenyl and each R5 and each R6 are not required to be the same; and<br>
R3 and R4 are each independently selected from hydrogen, -OH, C1, C2, C3 or C4 alkyl, C1, C2, C3 or C4 haloalkyl, C1, C2, C3 or C4 alkoxy, C1, C2, C3 or C4 alkenyl.<br>
Halogen, a preferred R2 group, may be selected from chloro, fluoro, bromo and iodo. Most preferred as R2 is chloro.<br>
In a preferred embodiment every R5 and every R6 is hydrogen.<br>
Preferably R1 is alkyl and comprises 1,2, 3 or 4 carbon atoms and particularly comprises 1 or 2 carbon atoms. In an exemplary embodiment, R1 is methyl.<br>
Most preferably NR3R4 is NH2.<br>
Most preferably, m is 1 and R2is CI. Particularly preferably R2 is located at position 5.<br>
R7 is a carboxy group (-COOH) or moiety convertible to a carboxy group, for example an amide or nitrile. Preferably, R7 is a protected carboxy group or equivalent, i.e. a moiety which will be substantially inert to reaction with -NR3R4 groups during step A but convertible thereafter to a carboxy group. Nitrile is preferred.<br>
When R7 is a nitrile, step B is preferably step B2. When R7 is a carboxy group, Step B is preferably step B1.<br>
M is an alkali metal and may be K or Li. Most preferably, the alkali metal M is Na (and therefore M+ is Na+). Y is a basic counterion, e.g. carbonate or hydroxide. Particularly preferably MY is NaOH.<br>
In compounds (I), (III) and (IV). the phenolic hydroxy group may be in the form of a salt, for example a sodium salt.<br>
Compounds of the formula (IV) or (V) may contain trace amounts of DMF. Preferably, the compounds contain less than 1 % DMF e.g. less than 0.1 %, such as less than 0.05% DMF. The amount of DMF present is suitably measured by headspace gas chromatography.<br>
Compounds of the formula (V) may be hydrates, for example mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, (Formula Removed)<br>
penta- or hexa- hydrates. In particular, compounds of formula V are monohydrates:A particularly preferred compound of formula (IV) has the structure:<br>
(Structure Removed)<br>
A particularly preferred compound of formula (V) is:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The invention includes the preparation of anhydrides. Included also is the transformation of the acid (IV) or salt (V) to alternative solvates, alternative salts and/or to ester or other prodrug forms.<br>
The process of the present invention may be conducted under the following exemplary conditions:<br>
Step A<br>
React compounds I and II under basic conditions in DMF. The basic conditions,<br>
which will cause at least a proportion of the OH groups to be O-, may be created by pre-reacting the compound of formula (I) with a strong base (e.g. NaOMe or another alcoholate), or by including a strong base in the reaction mixture. Typically, the reaction is carried out at an elevated temperature of, e.g., at least 90oC and often no<br><br>
more than 1259C (e.g. from 95oC to 110oC) and in practice the mixture is stirred. The duration of the reaction may be from, for example, about 6 to 12 hours.<br>
Step B<br>
B1<br>
If the product of step A comprises a salt, it is subjected to acid work-up, for example as follows: at a temperature of, for example from about 30oC to about 55oC for example 40oC to 50oC, the product is treated with acid, e.g. hydrochloric acid (25-50% m/m, e.g. 30-40% m/m). The resultant acid is isolated. If the resulting product forms a suspension, the mixture may be cooled, for example, to about 5-0oC and the solid collected by e.g. filtration. If the resulting product is in solution (or partially in solution) the product solution may be extracted, by e.g. ethylactetate, the solvent evaporated to dryness. The product (IV) may be recrystalised in e.g. hot ethanol/water.<br>
B2<br>
If R7 of compound (II) is not a carboxy group, it is then, following step A, converted to a carboxy group. For example, a nitrile may be reacted with a base, e.g. NaOH. In some methods, a nitrile and NaOH or another strong base in e.g. aqueous solution are refluxed, suitably for up to 3 hours, to form the corresponding sodium carboxylate. Following the disappearance of the e.g. nitrile group, the solution may then be treated with a strong acid, for example concentrated sulphuric acid at a temperature of e.g. from about 30oC to about 55oC, for example 40oC to 50oC. The product is then isolated, e.g. extracted with an organic solvent for example an alkyl ester, e.g. ethylacetetate. Suitably, the solvent is then evaporated to dryness and the product (IV) recrystallised in, e.g., hot ethanol/water<br>
Step C<br>
Step C is itself inventive. Compound (IV), acetone and water are combined. The acetone.water ratio may be from about 5:1 v/v to about 15:1 v/v, e.g. about 10:1 to 11:1. A base is added to the mixture suitably at a slightly elevated temperature, e.g. about 40oC to 60oC, for example 45oC to 55oC. Further acetone may be added, for example as an acetone/water mixture, (e.g. from 2:1 v/v to 4:1 v/v, such as 3:1 v/v), suitably keeping the temperature at a moderately elevated level (e.g. 45oC-55oC). The salt is then isolated. One procedure is as follows: if the temperature is above 50oC, it is reduced to 50oC or less (e.g 40oC to 50oC such as 45oC to 48oC) and seed<br>
crystals are added to induce crystallisation, before further reducing the temperature [e.g. to 0oC to 5oC) to finish the crystallisation step prior to isolating the crystals. Stirring is suitably continued throughout. The crystals may be dried under vacuum 50-60 mbar at 50-55Â°C for at least 24 hours.<br>

Example 1<br>
Preparation of N-(5-chlorosalicyloyl)-8-aminocaprylic acid from amino-octane-nitrile<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 round bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirrer, is charged under nitrogen with the sodium salt of methyl-5-chloro-salicylate (20.8 g, 100 mmole), prepared from methyl-5-chloro-salicylate and sodium methylate in toluene, 8-aminoctane-nitrile (14.8 g, 105 mmole) and dimethylformamide (150 mL). The solution is heated to 100-<br>
110Â°C and stirred over night. The next morning a process steering control showed less than 1.5 % of starting material. The clear slightly brown solution was therefore concentrated to dryness (rotavapor) to yield a waxy solid (44.4 g). The latter was treated with sodium hydroxide (20 g in 180 ml water) and stirred under reflux over approximately three hours. Again, a process steering control showed the disappearance of the nitrite intermediate. The solution was then treated at 50Â°C with  about 20 g of cone. Sulphuric acid. Then ethyl acetate (150 ml) is added and the emulsion acidified with further 33 g of sulphuric acid (pH 1.7). Then, the aqueous phase is removed, and the remaining organic phase washed twice with water (50 ml each). The organic phase was then concentrated to dryness (rotavap) to yield 42 g of a solid residue, with was dissolved in hot ethanol/water (112 ml ethanol 95 %, 168 ml water). At 65Â°C the clear solution was saturated with 56 ml water, inducing the desired product to crystallise. The suspension was then cooled to 0Â°C and stirred for an hour. Finally, the solid was collected by filtration and dried under vacuum to yield a pure compound (26.4 g, 85 % of the theory).<br>
Example 2<br>
Preparation of N-(5-chlorosalicyloyl)-8-aminocaprylic acid from amino-octanoic acid<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
A round bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirrer, is charged under nitrogen with methyl-5-chloro-salicylate (18.7 g, 100 mmole), 8-amino-octanoic acid (15.2 g, 95 mmole) and dimethylformamide (60 mL). To the suspension is added a solution of sodium methylate (35.1 g a 30 % m/m). The suspension was then heated to 95-100Â°C, whereas methanol distilled off. After 24 h stirring, a control showed 98 % conversion. Therefore, water was added (160 ml), followed at 40Â°C by hydrochloric acid (22 ml, 37 % m/m) to drop the pH to a value of 2.2. The suspension formed was then cooled to 0Â°C, and the solid collected by filtration, to yield after drying the compound (28 g, 88 % of theory).<br>

N-5-(chlorosalicyloyl;-8-aminocaprylic acid (3.5 kg, 11.15 mol), acetone (9450 ml) and water (875 ml, purified) were placed in a 50 litre vessel under a nitrogen atmosphere and stirred at 45-55Â°C (jacket 60Â°C) until a clear solution was formed (20 to 30 minutes). Sodium hydroxide (297 g, 30 % w/w, 22.3 mol) was added in such a way as to maintain the temperature at 45-55Â°C, followed by a solution of acetone/water 3:1 v/v (1050 ml). The hot (50Â°C) solution was passed then over a polishing filter and the filtrate transferred to an other clean vessel heated to 45 to 55Â°C. The transfer line was rinsed with hot (45-55Â°C) acetone/water 3:1 v/v (1050 ml), and then acetone (about 10.5 litre) was added in such a way to keep the temperature around 45-55Â°C (jacket 55Â°C). Then, the temperature was lowered to 45-48Â°C and seed crystals (4 g) were added. The mixture was stirred for about 20-30 minute to obtain a fine suspension and induce crystallization, then more acetone (28 I) were added over one hour in such a way as to maintain a temperature of 45-50Â°C (jacket 55Â°C). Afterwards, a slow stirring was prolonged for one hour at 45-50Â°C, then the temperature was lowered to 0-5Â°C over a period of two hours. Stirring was continued at 0-5Â°C for an hour, then crystals were collected by centrifugation, washed with cold acetone/water 95:5 v/v (71) and dried under vacuum 50-60 mbar at 50-55Â°C for at least 24 hours to yield 4.19 kg of 5-CNAC di-sodium monohydrate (95 % yield).<br><br><br><br><br>
