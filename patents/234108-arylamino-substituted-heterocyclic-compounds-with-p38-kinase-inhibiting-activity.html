P-38 INHIBITORS RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
Priority is claimed herein to U.S. provisional patent application Serial Nos. 60/475,662, filed June 3,2003, and 60/531,541, filed December 19, 2003, entitled "P-38 INHIBITORS." For U.S. national stage purposes and where appropriate, the disclosures of the above-referenced provisional applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. HELD<br>
Provided herein are aminoaryl substituted 5-membered heterocyclic compounds which have cytokine inhibitory activity. Also provided are the uses of aminoaryl substituted 5-membered heterocyclic compounds for treating conditions associated with p38α  and β kinases and for treating p38 kinase-associated conditions. BACKGROUND<br>
A large number of cytokines participate in the inflammatory response, including IL-1, IL6, IL-8 and TNF-α. Overproduction of cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF-a are implicated in a wide variety of diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, endotoxin shock, osteoporosis, Alzheimer's disease, and congestive heart failure, among others (Henry et al., Drugs Fut., 24:1345-1354 (1999); Salituro et al., Curr. Med. Chem., 6:807-823 (1999)). Evidence in human patients indicates that protein antagonists of cytokines are effective in treating chronic inflammatory diseases, such as, for example, monoclonal antibody to TNF-a (Remicade) (Rankin et al., Br 1 Rheumatol, 34:334-342 (1995)), and soluble TNF-α receptor-Fc fusion protein (Etanercept) (Moreland et al.",; 25 Ann. Intern. Med., 130:478-486 (1999)).<br>
The biosynthesis of TNF-a occurs in many cell types in response to an external stimulus, such as, for example, a mitogen, an infectious organism, or trauma, Important mediators of TNF-a production are the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, and in particular, p38 kinases. These kinases are activated in response to various stress stimuli, including but not limited to proinflammatory cytokines, enflqtoxin, ultraviolet light, and osmotic shock. Activation of p38 requires dual phosphorylation by upstream MAP kinase kinases (MKK3 and MKK6) on threonine and tyrosine within a Thr-Gly-Tyr motif characteristic of p38 isozymes.<br><br>
There are four known isoforms of p38, i.e., p38cc, p38β, p38γ, and p385. The α and β isoforms are expressed in inflammatory cells and are key modulators of TNF-α production. Inhibiting the p38αand p enzymes in cells results in reduced levels of TNF-α expression. Also, administering inhibitors of p38α and β in animal models of inflammatory disease has proven that such inhibitors are effective in treating those diseases. Accordingly, the p38 enzymes serve an important role in inflammatory processes mediated by EL-1 and TNF-α . Compounds that reportedly inhibit p38 kinase and cytokines such as 1L-1 and TNF-α  for use in treating inflammatory diseases are disclosed in US Pats. Nos. 6,277,989 and 6,130,235 to Scios, Inc; US Pats. Nos. 6,147,080 and 5,945,418 to Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc; US Pats Nos. 6,251,914, 5,977,103 and 5,658,903 to Smith-Kline Beecham Corp.; US Pats. Nos. 5,932,576 and 6,087,496 to G.D. Searle &amp; Co,; WO 00/56738 and WO 01/27089 to Astra Zeneca; WO 01/34605 to Johnson &amp; Johnson; WO 00/12497 (quinazoline derivatives as p38 kinase inhibitors); WO 00/56738 (pyridine and pyrimidine derivatives for the same purpose); WO 00/12497 (discusses the relationship between p38 kinase inhibitors); and WO 00/12074 (piperazine and piperidine compounds useful as p38 inhibitors).<br>

In addition, pyrrolotriazine kinase inhibitors are disclosed in WO 02/40486, assigned to Bristol-Myers Squibb. Recent applications: WO 03/032970, WO 03/033482, WO03/032971, WO 03/032986, WO 03/032980, WO 03/032987, WO 03/033483, WO 03/033457 and WO 03/032972 are incorporated into this application.

particular test compound that elicits a dose-dependent response at 50% of maximal expression of a particular response that is induced, provoked or potentiated by the particular test compound.<br>
As used herein, a prodrug is a compound that, upon in vivo administration, is metabolized by one or more steps or processes or otherwise converted to the biologically, pharmaceutically or therapeutically active form of the compound. To produce a prodrug, the pharmaceutically active compound is modified such that the active compound will be regenerated by metabolic processes. The prodrug may be designed to alter the metabolic stability or the transport characteristics of a drug, to mask side effects or toxicity, to improve the flavor of a drug or to alter other characteristics or properties of a drug. By virtue of knowledge of pharmacodynamic processes and drug metabolism in vivo, those of skill in this art, once a pharmaceutically active compound is known, can design prodrugs of the compound (see, e.g., Nogrady (1985) Medicinal Chemistry A Biochemical Approach, Oxford University Press, New York, pages 388-392).<br>
It is to be understood that the compounds provided herein may contain chiral centers. Such chiral centers may be of either the (R) or (S) configuration, or may be a mixture thereof. Thus, the compounds provided herein may be enantiomerically pure, or be stereoisomeric or diastereomeric mixtures.<br>
As used herein, substantially pure means sufficiently homogeneous to appear free of readily detectable impurities as determined by standard methods of analysis, such as thin layer chromatography (TLC), gel electrophoresis, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and mass spectrometry (MS), used by those of skill in the art to assess such purity, or sufficiently pure such that further purification would not detectably alter the physical and chemical properties, such as enzymatic and biological activities, of the substance. Methods for purification of the compounds to produce substantially chemically pure compounds are known to those of skill in the art. A substantially chemically pure compound may, however, be a mixture of stereoisomers. In such instances, further purification might increase the specific activity of the compound. The instant disclosure is meant to include all such possible isomers, as well as, their racemic and optically pure forms. Optically active (+) and (-), (R)- and (S)-, or (D)- and (L)-isomers may be prepared using chiral synthons or<br><br>
chiral reagents, or resolved using conventional techniques, such as reverse phase HPLC. When the compounds described herein contain olefinic double bonds or other centers of geometric asymmetry, and unless specified otherwise, it is intended that the compounds include both E and Z geometric isomers. Likewise, all tautomeric forms are also intended to be included.<br>

A second method of preparing 2-aminooxazoles of type (XII) is outlined in scheme 13. Reaction of an appropriately substitited isothiocyanate with an acylazide of the type described in schemes 14a-14d in the presence of a phosphine such as triphenylphosphine in a solvent such as dichloromethane or dioxane at a temperature from room temperature to 100 °C<br>
Caution: Appropriate safety methods, which are known to those experienced in conducting azide reactions, such as use of a blast shield, blast wall, or similar containment device, particularly when the reaction involves heating the organic azide, as well as the use of appropriate personal protection to avoid exposure to azides which may be toxic, must be exercised during the preparation and use of organic azides.<br><br>
Azides useful herein may be prepared using one of the sequences outlined in schemes 14a-14d.<br>
Scheme 14a outlines the treatment of the oc-bromoketone with sodium azide in<br>
a solvent such as acetone, generally at room temperature, to yield the desired a-azidoketones useful as intermediates herein. a-Bromoketones are either commercially available or readily prepared by reaction of a ketone with a 10 brominating agent such as bromine in acetic acid or pyridinium bromide per bromide and 30% hydrobromic acid.<br><br><br><br>
Scheme 14d illustrated preparation of a-bromoketone by reaction of an aryl bromide with tributyl-(l-ethoxyvinyl) tin and bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium dichloride to provide an intermediate enol ether. Treatment of the enol ether with N-bromosuccinamide at a temperature from 0°C to room temperature yields the <x-bromoketone. as previously described treatment of the a-bromoketone with sodium azide in acetone gives a-azidoketone.></x-bromoketone.><br>
Imidazoles useful herein may be prepared according to the method outlined in scheme 15. Reaction of a guanidine with an a-bromoketone yields 2-aminoimidazoles of type (XIV) in the presence of a base, such as potassium carbonate, in a solvent, such as N,N-dimethylformamide, provides the desired aminoimidazoles. It is recognized that more than one isomeric imidazole can form during this reaction and the desired product can be obtained by a suitable chromatographic method or by recrystalization. (Bioorg. Med. Chem. Letters 12: 3125-3128(2002))<br><br><br>
Amines attached to aryl or heteroaryl ring systems are useful as intermediates herein. There are many methods of preparing such intermediates known to one skilled in the art of organic chemistry. Several methods of preparing amines useful herein are illustrated in schemes 16-18.<br>
Substituted aniline of type (XV) can be prepared from commercially available methyl 4-iodobenzoate as depicted in scheme 16, Nitration followed by reduction of the nitro group yields the aniline. Palladium-catalyzed coupling with ethynyltrimethylsilane, followed by desilylation and saponification gives the desired ethynyl-substituted aminobenzoic acid. Coupling with methoxyamine using coupling agent EDC affords the desired aniline (XV). (Eur. J. Org. Chem, 4607 (2001))<br><br>
Alternatively, substituted aniline of type (XV) can be prepared 4-amino-3-nitrobenzoic acid as depicted in scheme 17. Iodide substitution of the aryldiazonium salt, followed by esterification with methanol gives methyl 4-iodo-3-nitrobenzoate. The nitro group can be reduced by SnCU to give the desired aniline. Palladium catalyzed coupling with ethynyltrimethylsilane, followed by desilylation and saponification yields the ethynyl-substituted aminobenzoic acid. Coupling with methoxyamine using coupling agent EDC affords the desired aniline (XV). (Eur. J. Org. Chem., 4607 (2001))<br><br><br><br>

D.       Formulation of pharmaceutical compositions<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein contain therapeutically effective amounts of one or more of the cytokine activity modulators provided herein that are useful in the prevention, treatment, or amelioration of one or more of the symptoms of diseases or disorders associated with cytokine activity, in one embodiment, p38 kinase activity. Such diseases or disorders include, but are not limited to, inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, destructive bone disorders, proliferative disorders, angiogenic disorders, infectious diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, and viral diseases.<br>
The compositions contain one or more compounds provided herein. The compounds are formulated into suitable pharmaceutical preparations such as solutions, suspensions, tablets, dispersible tablets, pills, capsules, powders, sustained release formulations or elixirs, for oral administration or in sterile solutions or suspensions for parenteral administration, as well as transdermal patch preparation and dry powder inhalers. Typically the compounds described above are formulated into pharmaceutical compositions using techniques and procedures well known in the art (see, e.g., Ansel Introduction to Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Fourth Edition 1985,126).<br>
In the compositions, effective concentrations of one or more compounds or pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives is (are) mixed with a suitable pharmaceutical carrier or vehicle. The compounds may be derivatized as the corresponding salts,<br><br>
esters, enol ethers or esters, acids, bases, solvates, hydrates or prodrugs prior to formulation, as described above. The concentrations of the compounds in the compositions are effective for delivery of an amount, upon administration, that treats, prevents, or ameliorates one or more of the symptoms of diseases or disorders associated with cytokine activity or in which cytokine activity is implicated. Such diseases or disorders include, but are not limited to, inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, destructive bone disorders, proliferative disorders, angiogenic disorders, infectious diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, and viral diseases.<br>
Typically, the compositions are formulated for single dosage administration. To formulate a composition, the weight fraction of compound is dissolved, suspended, dispersed or otherwise mixed in a selected vehicle at an effective concentration such that the treated condition is relieved or ameliorated. Pharmaceutical carriers or vehicles suitable for administration of the compounds provided herein include any such carriers known to those skilled in the art to be suitable for the particular mode of administration.<br>
In addition, the compounds maybe formulated as the sole pharmaceutically active ingredient in the composition or may be combined with other active ingredients. Liposomal suspensions, including tissue-targeted liposomes, such as tumor-targeted liposomes, may also be suitable as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These may be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art. For example, liposome formulations may be prepared as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,522,811. Briefly, liposomes such as multilamellar vesicles (MLV's) maybe formed by drying down egg phosphatidyl choline and brain phosphatidyl serine (7:3 molar ratio) on the inside of a flask. A solution of a compound provided herein in phosphate buffered saline lacking divalent cations (PBS) is added and the flask shaken until the lipid film is dispersed. The resulting vesicles are washed to remove unencapsulated compound, pelleted by centrifugation, and then resuspended in PBS.<br>
The active compound is included in the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier in an amount sufficient to exert a therapeutically useful effect in the absence of undesirable side effects on the patient treated.<br>
The concentration of active compound in the pharmaceutical composition will depend on absorption, inactivation and excretion rates of the active compound, the<br><br>
physicochemical characteristics of the compound, the dosage schedule, and amount administered as well as other factors known to those of skill in the art. For example, the amount that is delivered is sufficient to ameliorate one or more of the symptoms of diseases or disorders associated with cytokine activity or in which cytokine activity is implicated, as described herein.<br>
The effective amount of a compound of provided herein may be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art, and includes exemplary dosage amounts for a mammal of from about 0.05 to 100 mg/kg of body weight of active compound per day, which may be administered in a single dose or in the form of individual divided doses, such as from 1 to 4 times per day. It will be understood that the specific dose level and frequency of dosage for any particular subject may be varied and will depend upon a variety of factors, including the activity of the specific compound employed, the metabolic stability and length of action of that compound, the species, age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the subject, the mode and time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, and severity of the particular condition.<br>
The active ingredient may be administered at once, or may be divided into a number of smaller doses to be administered at intervals of time. It is understood that the precise dosage and duration of treatment is a function of the disease being treated and may be determined empirically using known testing protocols or by extrapolation from in vivo or in vitro test data. It is to be noted that concentrations and dosage values may also vary with the severity of the condition to be alleviated. It is to be further understood that for any particular subject, specific dosage regimens should be adjusted over time according to the individual need and the professional judgment of the person administering or supervising the administration of the compositions, and that the concentration ranges set forth herein are exemplary only and are not intended to limit the scope or practice of the claimed compositions.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives include acids, bases, enol ethers and esters, salts, esters, hydrates, solvates and prodrug forms. The derivative is selected such that its pharmacokinetic properties are superior to the corresponding neutral compound.<br>
Thus, effective concentrations or amounts of one or more of the compounds<br><br>
described herein or pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof are mixed with a suitable pharmaceutical carrier or vehicle for systemic, topical or local administration to form pharmaceutical compositions. Compounds are included in an amount effective for ameliorating one or more symptoms of, or for treating or preventing diseases or disorders associated with cytokine activity or in which cytokine activity is implicated, as described herein. The concentration of active compound in the composition will depend on absorption, inactivation, excretion rates of the active compound, the dosage schedule, amount administered, particular formulation as well as other factors known to those of skill in the art.<br>
The compositions are intended to be administered by a suitable route, including orally in form of capsules, tablets, granules, powders or liquid formulations including syrups; parenterally, such as subcutaneously, intravenously, intramiscularly, with inteasternal injection or infusion techniques (as sterile injectable aq. or non-aq. solutions or suspensions); nasally such as by inhalation spray; topically, such as in the form of a cream or ointment; rectally such as in the form of suppositories; liposomally; and locally. The compositions can be in liquid, semi-liquid or solid form and are formulated in a manner suitable for each route of administration. In certain embodiments, administration of the formulation include parenteral and oral modes of administration. In one embodiment, the compositions are administered orally.<br>
Solutions or suspensions used for parenteral, intradermal, subcutaneous, or topical application can include any of the following components: a sterile diluent, such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oil, polyethylene glycol, glycerine, propylene glycol or other synthetic solvent; antimicrobial agents, such as benzyl alcohol and methyl parabens; antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid and sodium bisulfite; chelating agents, such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA); buffers, such as acetates, citrates and phosphates; and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose. Parenteral preparations can be enclosed in ampules, disposable syringes or single or multiple dose vials made of glass, plastic or other suitable material.<br>
In instances in which the compounds exhibit insufficient solubility, methods for solubilizing compounds may be used. Such methods are known to those of skill in this art, and include, but are not limited to, using cosolvents, such as<br><br>
dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), using surfactants, such as TWEEN®, or dissolution in aqueous sodium bicarbonate. Derivatives of the compounds, such as prodrugs of the compounds may also be used in formulating effective pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
Upon mixing or addition of the compound(s), the resulting mixture may be a solution, suspension, emulsion or the like. The form of the resulting mixture depends upon a number of factors, including the intended mode of administration and the solubility of the compound in the selected carrier or vehicle. The effective concentration is sufficient for ameliorating the symptoms of the disease, disorder or condition treated and may be empirically determined,<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions are provided for administration to humans and animals in unit dosage forms, such as tablets, capsules, pills, powders, granules, sterile parenteral solutions or suspensions, and oral solutions or suspensions, and oil-water emulsions containing suitable quantities of the compounds or pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof.

Unit-dose forms as used herein refers to physically discrete units suitable for human and animal subjects and packaged individually as is known in the art. Each unit-dose contains a predetermined quantity of the therapeutically active compound sufficient to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier, vehicle or diluent. Examples of unit-dose forms include ampoules and syringes and individually packaged tablets or capsules. Unit-dose forms may be administered in fractions or multiples thereof. A multiple-dose form is a plurality of identical unit-dosage forms packaged in a single container to be administered in segregated unit-dose form. Examples of multiple-dose forms include vials, bottles of tablets or capsules or bottles of pints or gallons. Hence, multiple dose form is a multiple of unit-doses which are not segregated in packaging.<br>
The composition can contain along with the active ingredient: a diluent such as lactose, sucrose, dicalcium phosphate, or carboxymethylcellulose; a lubricant, such as magnesium stearate, calcium stearate and talc; and a binder such as starch, natural gums, such as gum acaciagelatin, glucose, molasses, polvinylpyrrolidine, celluloses and derivatives thereof, povidone, crospovidones and other such binders known to<br><br>
those of skill in the art. Liquid pharmaceutically administrable compositions can, for example, be prepared by dissolving, dispersing, or otherwise mixing an active compound as defined above and optional pharmaceutical adjuvants in a carrier, such as, for example, water, saline, aqueous dextrose, glycerol, glycols, ethanol, and the like, to thereby form a solution or suspension. If desired, the pharmaceutical composition to be administered may also contain minor amounts of nontoxic auxiliary substances such as wetting agents, emulsifying agents, or solubilizing agents, pH buffering agents and the like, for example, acetate, sodium citrate, cyclodextrine derivatives, sorbitan monolaurate, triethanolamine sodium acetate, triethanolamine oleate, and other such agents. Actual methods of preparing such dosage forms are known, or will be apparent, to those skilled in this art; for example, see Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., 15th Edition, 1975. The composition or formulation to be administered will, in any event, contain a quantity of the active compound in an amount sufficient to alleviate the symptoms of the treated subject.<br>
Dosage forms or compositions containing active ingredient in the range of 0.005% to 100% with the balance made up from non-toxic carrier may be prepared. For oral administration, a pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic composition is formed by the incorporation of any of the normally employed excipients, such as, for example pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, talcum, cellulose derivatives, sodium crosscarmellose, glucose, sucrose, magnesium carbonate or sodium saccharin. Such compositions include solutions, suspensions, tablets, capsules, powders and sustained release formulations, such as, but not limited to, implants and microencapsulated delivery systems, and biodegradable, biocompatible polymers, such as collagen, ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, polyorthoesters, polylactic acid and others. Methods for preparation of these compositions are known to those skilled in the art. The contemplated compositions may contain 0.001%-100% active ingredient, in one embodiment 0.1-85%, in another embodiment 75-95%.<br>
The compounds may be administered in a form suitable for immediate release or extended release. Immediate release or extended release may be achieved with suitable pharmaceutical compositions or, particularly in the case of extended release,<br><br>
with devices such as subcutaneous implants or osmotic pumps. Exemplary compositions for topical administration include a topical carrier such as PLASTBASE® (mineral oil gelled with polyethylene).<br>
