OXYGEN SCAVENGING COMPOSITION<br>
FUTURA POLYESTERS LIMITED<br>
an Indian Company<br>
of Paragon Condominium, 3rd floor, Pandurang Budhkar Marg,<br>
Mumbai 400 013, Maharashtra, India<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE<br>
INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br>
OXYGEN SCAVENGING COMPOSITION Technical Field<br>
This invention relates to polyester resins used in food packaging applications for foods and other items for human consumption.<br>
Particularly, this invention relates to polyester resins used for packaging oxygen sensitive food items including alcoholic beverages, fruit beverages and the like, where the oxygen permeation levels are to be maintained at very low levels.<br>
Background<br>
In this specification the term 'polyester resin' or 'carrier resin' or 'resin carrier' is understood to mean and include any thermoplastic homo polymer or a co polymer and particularly, a PET(Polyethylene Terephthalate) resin or a PTN(Polytrimethylene Naphthalate) resin or PBN(Polybutylene Naphthalate) resin or a Polytrimethylene Terephthalate (PTT) resin or PBT(Polybutylene Terephthalate) resin or a combination or alloy blend of any of these alone or with a naphthalate or butylene compound and includes all linear or branched polyesters.    Preferably, the term 'carrier resin' or 'resin<br>
carrier' is a resin having a lower melting point than the resin included in the term 'polyester resin'.<br>
Polyester resins and carrier resins are typically prepared by processes well known in the<br>
art which typically comprise reacting a diol such as 1,3 propanediol, 1,4 butenediol, ethylene glycol, trimethylene glycol, or resorcinol with a dicarboxylic acid such as terephthalic acid, isopththalic acid, or its esters such as phthalic esters or naphthalic esters in a melt phase polymerization step in an approximate 1:1 stoichiometric reaction, preferably in the presence of a catalyst such as antimony or titanium compounds. Melt phase polymerization is followed by post polymerization steps such as crystallization in the temperature range of 100 to 150 degrees Celsius and solid phase polymerization in the temperature range of 195 to 235 degrees Celsius either in a discontinuous batch<br>
process or a continuous solid state process. These steps increase the intrinsic viscosity of the resin to a value suitable for conversion into a desired packaging material.<br>
2<br><br>
These resins are converted to walled containers for food items and other items by typically by an extrusion, a blow molding process or an injection molding or stretch blow molding process or the resin is extruded in the form of a film which is in turn used for making containers such as pouches for packaging food and other items. Hereinafter, the term 'container' will deem to include all containers whether rigid walled or flexible walled, of any shape or size and dimension and includes a pouch, a blister pack, a pharmaceutical pack, a bottle, and a lidded container.<br>
One of the parameters affecting the efficiency of these containers is its oxygen transmission and absorption property. Gases affect items packaged in these containers in two primary ways. Each resin has its own gas transmission rate and a walled container, depending on the thickness of the wall and other parameters, will transmit moisture and gases according to a predetermined 'transmission rate'. Secondly, many packaged items release gases in the packed state and these gases again need to be dealt with. Gases, particularly, oxygen effect the items stored within these containers, in that, they effect the freshness, taste and cause deterioration of the nutrients and flavor components of items, particularly food and medicinal products. Also the formation of oxidative byproducts affects product quality.<br>
One of the measures used to attenuate the affect of gases is the use of preservatives like sorbates, ascorbates, benzoates, and sulfur dioxide. The use of such preservatives is now being seriously questioned. In fact, the use of preservatives is increasingly being banned.<br>
Another method of preventing the ingress of oxygen is the use of 'passive barrier' methods. "Passive" gas barrier protection is offered by certain polymeric layers like ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH) or polyvinylidene dichloride (PVDC). In passive barrier there is only a physical blocking of oxygen ingress or egress from the container and there is no reaction with the oxygen. Oxygen scavenging by polymer barrier films especially in the form of multi layers is well known and described in several prior art references including the following US Patents : 5,648,020, 5,498,364, 5,425,986, 5,399,289, 5,350,622 which deal with an oxygen barrier layer in a multi layered container. Such layers are generally of EVOH, PVDC, polyisoprene and the like.<br>
3<br><br>
Yet another method of reducing oxygen is the use of oxygen scavenging agents in the resin, which act as a barrier to oxygen or which absorb oxygen entrapped in the container. These are referred to popularly as 'active barrier protection agents'. "Active" Oxygen barrier agents or scavenging agents act as barriers to oxygen. In active oxygen protection there is reaction with the oxygen by the oxygen scavenging agent and this scavenging process protects an oxygen sensitive product by not only preventing oxygen from reaching the product from the outside but also absorbing oxygen present within a container.<br>
The benefits of oxygen scavenging are numerous. Reduced oxygen enhances freshness, retains taste and protects nutrients and flavor components of food products. Also the<br>
formation of oxidative by-products which may affect product quality are decreased. It also eliminates the need of using preservatives like sorbates, ascorbates, benzoates, sulfur dioxide and the like.<br>
Various types of oxygen scavengers are used in packaging systems in order to protect them from the detrimental effects of oxygen exposure. There are primarily three types of oxygen scavengers, which are widely utilized. The most conventional approach is the use of metal based absorbers such as iron or its lower oxides, Cobalt or Copper based metals or their lower oxides. Here, the finely divided metal or its lower oxide gets oxidized to its higher state by oxygen in the presence of appropriate humidity or moisture conditions. The second approach of oxygen scavenging is by making use of low molecular weight organic compounds like ascorbic acid or sodium ascorbate which bind oxygen by oxidizing carbon-carbon double bonds. The third method incorporates a polymeric based oxygen scavenging resin along with a catalyst. The polymeric system binds oxygen through oxidation of the polymer chain. Irrespective of the type of oxygen absorber, oxygen scavengers have to satisfy certain other requirements. For instance, the oxygen scavengers should not be themselves affected during the process of extrusion, they should not impair the look of the container, they should not affect the clarity of the container and finally they should conform to existing packaging processes and equipment.<br>
A variety of oxygen scavengers have been suggested both in mono layer and multi layer containers. For example, in the OXBAR barrier system the oxygen scavenging<br>
4<br><br>
component is a polyamide like MXD-6 nylon coupled with a transition metal catalyst (e.g. cobalt). This type of oxygen scavenger has been described in US Patents 5,759,653, 5,239,016, 5,049,624, 5,034,252, 5,021,515 et al., EP 380,830, 380,319, 301,719 and in New Zealand Patent 227,779.<br>
US Patents 5,518,792 and 5,405,880 suggest Oxygen scavengers based on polypropylene, US 5,399,289, 5,310,497 and 5,211,875, EP 0520257 and WO 95/04776) have suggested polybutadiene, US patents 5,700,554 and 5,529,833 disclose polyisoprene , (US 5,492,742, 5,364,555, 6,465,065 &amp; 6,391,406 and EP 328336, disclose monomelic and oligomeric oxidizable compounds such as ascorbic acids and ascorbates, salicylic acid , US 5,529,833 discloses the use of chelates squalene and unsaturated fatty acids; US Patent discloses 5,776,361; WO 94/12590 discloses polyterpenes and dihydroantharcene. Compositions comprising copolyamides consisting of 50 % polyamide segments and active oxygen scavenging polyolefin oligomer segments are disclosed in US 6,506,463. Mixture of polymers which comprises at least 40 % of 2,6-naphthalate units and up to 60 % ethylene terephthalate units giving high oxygen barrier are described in US 6,534,169.<br>
AmosorbDFC oxygen scavengers from BP Amoco are block polycondensates comprising predominantly polycondensate segments and an oxygen scavenging amount of polyolefin oligomer segments like polybutadiene especially in the presence of a transition metal catalyst, such as cobalt and optionally with benzophenone are described in US 6,558,762, and 6,365,247<br>
Chevron Phillips in association with Cryovac Corp. has developed an oxygen scavenging polymer (OSP) which claims distinction from other oxygen scavenging polymers in that scavenging is conducted without the generation of degradation products that may easily migrate out of the polymer matrix which in turn could cause negative organoleptic effects. The OSP system is a blend of two components - 90% blend is an oxidizable polymer, ethylene methacrylate cyclohexnyl methyl acrylate (EMCM) as the oxidizable resin and 10 % is a catalyst master batch consisting of a cobalt salt and a proprietary photoinitiator (PI). The oxygen scavenging process is catalyzed by the formation of free radicals triggered by the UV activation process. Refer US Patents 5,627,239 &amp; 5,736,616, and WO 9948963,98/51758 and 98/51759.<br>

ActiTUF developed by M &amp; G Polymers has a proprietary oxygen scavenger technology which gets activated only when the container is filled with beverage.<br>
Inert thin film barrier coatings like ActisTM film of amorphous carbon, Diamond-Like-Carbon (DLC), Bairocade a thermo set epoxy amine, Plasma-Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD) of silicon dioxide, Glaskin silicon dioxide etc. are generally used for good barrier properties for gases like oxygen, carbon dioxide and the like.<br>
Nanocomposites like clays dispersed in a polymer matrix which create a tortuous path for the passage of gas provide effective barrier improvement. AegisOX is a polymerized nanocomposite nylon resin specially formulated for high oxygen and carbon dioxide barrier performance. Triton has a patented technology based on the inclusion of inert inorganic fillers that exhibit a platelet nanostructure which can be easily compounded with a base resin like PET to improve the barrier property.<br>
Also in the emerging gas barrier technology Liquid Crystal Polymers play an important role.<br>
Most of these commercial oxygen scavengers are capable of absorbing significantly less than 0.4ml of oxygen per gram of the copolymer.<br>
The oxidation of iron Fe is the basis for some widely used oxygen scavenger systems. Oxygen absorption occurs in two stages and requires water vapor to be present. The Fe first combines with oxygen and water to form ferrous hydroxide. Further reaction with oxygen and water forms ferric hydroxide which gets stabilized as hydrated ferric oxide 4Fe + 6H20 + 302 -&gt; 4Fe(OH)3 -» 2Fe203.6H20<br>
The amount of oxygen adsorbed is a function of initial Fe powder morphology and its specific surface area. By stoichiometry for typical materials one gram of Fe will absorb approximately 300cc of oxygen.<br>
Iron based oxygen absorbers have been suggested in US Patents 4,127,503 of Nov.28,1978 which describes iron based oxygen absorbers having a metal powder, preferably iron, covered with a metal halide. Ageless developed by Mitsubishi Corp. is<br>
6<br><br>
composed of finely divided ferrous oxide, a chloride salt and a humectant sealed inside a permeable paper or plastic packet much like that used for silica gel but unlike silica gel the packets cannot be reused once exhausted.<br>
US 4,192,773 describes metal halide coated iron powder as oxygen scavengers.<br>
Other oxygen-scavenging systems are disclosed in US 4,299,719 which states that ferrous carbonate can be combined with a mixture of a reduced iron powder and a metal halide; or an alkali metal hydroxide and/or an alkaline earth metal hydroxide or calcium oxide to give oxygen absorbing composition and US 4,510,162 which discloses an oxygen absorbent composition comprising iron particles and yeast mixed together with moisture, the moisture being provided by a vinegar/water solution or a mixture of ascorbic acid and sodium bisulfate.<br>
US 4,711,741 makes use of iron in combination with halogen containing oxy acid salts like NaClO4 or NaCl03 as a composition for oxygen absorbing.<br>
Oxygard is a polymer based oxygen scavenger containing about 75 % polyolefin and 25 % reduced iron and is described in US Patent 5,153,038.<br>
US 5,928,560 claims acceleration of oxygen absorption rate in the iron system, besides water, by the addition of an acid.<br>
US 6,899,822 describes an oxygen absorbing composition for use as a component of a plastic packaging material which includes in relatively sufficient proportions iron, acidifier and electrolyte with the latter two components at high concentrations.<br>
US 6,780,916 deals with a resin composition of film forming polyester of PET, PEN, PBT &amp; PTT containing an oxygen scavenger comprising iron particles as the preferred metal amongst other metals and having a size of between about 1 to 70 microns . Though the color and haze values are discussed for the stretch blow molded bottles no information is available on the oxygen scavenging capacity of the resin.<br>
7<br><br>
US 6,666,988 and 6,508,955 describe an iron-based oxygen scavenging packet which exhibits an increased rate of oxygen absorption in the presence of an accelerator comprising water. The addition of an electrolyte, either dissolved in the water or added as a solid in the oxygen scavenger packet, further increases the rate of oxygen uptake. Electrolytes like NaCl, MgCl2 &amp; CaCl2 are suggested.<br>
JP 62-215,010 discloses a deodorizing fiber obtained by treating thermoplastic fibers with inorganic particles of divalent ferrous iron and L-ascorbic acid.<br>
US 6,616,861 claims a rapid rate of oxygen absorption by introducing an alcohol-water mixture as an activator for iron-based absorber systems<br>
US 6,586,514 describes oxygen-scavenging compositions comprising an oxidizable metal component, an electrolyte component and a solid, non-electrolytic, acidifying component. Examples of oxidizable metals disclosed include iron, zinc, copper, aluminum, and tin. Examples of suitable electrolyte components include various electrolytic alkali, alkaline earth and transition metal halides, sulfates, nitrates, carbonates, sulfites and phosphates, such as sodium chloride, potassium bromide, calcium carbonate, magnesium sulfate and cupric nitrate.<br>
All the aforesaid prior art suggestions require that to obtain sufficient oxygen absorption in active-barrier packaging, high loadings of scavenger compositions, including the iron particle based compositions, are often necessary. This typically requires that wall structures of the bottles containing a scavenging composition be relatively thick which results in other undesirable characteristics.<br>
From the prior art on iron based oxygen scavengers it is clear that iron based oxygen scavengers have been used predominantly for food packaging applications and sparingly for demanding applications like for packaging beer, fruit juices, ketchup and the like in polyester bottles wherein because of the nature of the products, the permissible oxygen permeation level is very low.<br>
There is a need for an oxygen scavenging agent and a resin blend for food packaging applications, for foods required particularly for human consumption, especially oxygen<br>
8<br><br>
sensitive food items such as alcoholic beverages (beer), fruit beverages, where oxygen levels permitted are relatively very low.<br>
An object of this invention is to provide packaging media with an oxygen scavenging composition of the present invention for storing human consumption food items.<br>
Another object of this in invention is to provide an oxygen scavenging composition, which does not substantially affect the color of the article , typically a bottle or other polymer container made from the resin incorporating such an agent.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide such an oxygen scavenging agent which will perform with desired results with relatively lesser amount of loadings. Yet another object of the invention is to provide an oxygen scavenging composition which is easy to handle, store and utilize, which does not warrant elaborate precautions and practices.<br>
The applicants have surprisingly found that the use of fine iron particles in the micron range combined with nano sized iron particles either alone or in combination with a halide promoter and an acid salt catalyst enhances the oxygen absorption rate of an oxygen scavenging composition and meets with the objects of this invention.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention even better advantage is obtained by incorporating the oxygen scavenger as a master batch in a carrier resin comprising a passive barrier component like PTN or an alloy blend of PET with PTN or PET with PBN and deriving the advantage of both active and passive oxygen barrier properties .<br>
The primary feature of the present invention is the provision of an oxygen scavenging composition comprising a judicious mixture of micron size and nano-sized iron particles and additives dispersed uniformly in a suitable non reactive carrier resin having a passive barrier component of an alloy blend of PET with PTN or PBN or PBT and the like, as a master batch having a lower melting point to facilitate easy and uniform dispersion of the active component in a passive barrier medium acting as the carrier.<br>
9<br><br>
Therefore, the oxygen scavenging composition in accordance with this invention acts both as an active and a passive barrier and is triggered by moisture / water for its reaction with oxygen.<br>
Yet another feature of the present invention is the development of a master batch containing a carrier resin comprising alloy blends of PET with PTN, PBN or PBT or their copolyesters as the carrier and having a maximum high loading (of ~ 25 %) of the oxygen scavenger incorporated in it.<br>
One more feature of the present invention is to have in the carrier resin used for the master batch, passive barrier additives, amber or other color pigment composition and ultraviolet light absorbers which are critical for sensitive packaging applications like (beer).<br>
A particular feature of the present invention is the benefit of delayed action of oxygen absorption arising from the presence of a mixture of relatively coarse and fine micron sized iron particles in addition to the nano sized particles.<br>
One more claim of the present invention is the additional passive oxygen scavenging action performed by the carrier resin like the alloy of PET with PTN, PBN or PBT and their blends but more preferably by the alloy of PTN with PET blend due to their excellent passive barrier action towards gases.<br>

Therefore the present invention discloses an iron-based active oxygen scavenging composition comprising a mixture of iron particles of 1 to 50 micron and preferably a mixture of 1 to 10 micron and 15 to 30 micron along with nano sized iron particles of 5 to 50 nanometers (nm).<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an Oxygen scavenging composition which acts both as an active and passive barrier, said composition comprising a resin carrier, mixed micron size and nano-sized iron particles, and optionally at least one alkali bisulphate, and/or a metal halide, and/or ascorbic acid or a metal ascorbate and other desired additives.<br>
Typically, the metal ascorbate is at least one ascorbate selected from a group consisting of sodium ascorbate, potassium ascorbate, sodium ascorbate, magnesium ascorbate, calcium ascorbate, zinc ascorbate, chromium ascorbate,<br>
The resin carrier is selected preferably from an alloy blend of Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) with Polytrimethylene Naphthalate (PTN), Polybutylene Naphthalate(PBN),<br>
14<br><br>
Polybutyiene Terephthalate (PBT), Isophthalic acid modified PET like PETI or their copolyesters and their alloy blends preferably PET with PTN or PET with PBN due to their excellent passive barrier properties.<br>
The iron particle mixture with a particle size in the range of 1 to 50 micron and preferably a mixture of 1 to 10 micron and 15 to 30 micron along with nano sized iron particles of 5 to 50 nanometers (nm) surprisingly have a synergistically an additional enhanced rate of oxygen absorption. The oxygen scavenging composition for additional benefit also includes metal halide, ascorbates and bisulfates of alkali metals.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the oxygen scavenging composition comprises a carrier in the form of a polyester resin selected from an alloy of PET with PTN or PBN or their copolyesters and their blends but preferably PET with PTN or PET with PBN at a maximum of 75:25 % composition.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the percentage of oxygen scavenger that is incorporated in said composition is up to a maximum of 25 %.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, an electrolyte in the form of a metal halide to facilitate the oxidation of iron particles and bisulfates of alkali metals is incorporated in said composition.<br>
In order to accelerate the oxidation reaction, an acidic component is incorporated in said oxygen scavenging composition in the form of bisulfate of alkali metals and ascorbates of alkali metals. Bisulfates and ascorbates being acidic in nature, they accelerate the iron oxidation reaction by promoting the formation of hydronium ions (H3O+). This hydronium ion helps in abstracting the electrons from iron and facilitates the formation of Fe2+, which is a prerequisite for its reaction with oxygen and act as the oxygen scavenger. The oxidation reaction is provided in the following sequence.<br><br>
15<br><br>
Advantageously, the iron particles used in the present invention are pre-treated with C3 to C8 alcohols preferably selected from Propanol, Butanol and the like, under refluxing conditions. These alcohols are effective reductants under dehydrogenation conditions and cause the renewal of the surface of iron particles i.e. they increase the exposure of the number of iron atoms per surface area which helps to increase the oxidation efficiency of iron.<br>
Still advantageously, the oxygen scavenging composition of the present invention is compounded with carrier resins containing appropriate quantities of barrier additives, green, blue and amber color compositions, ultraviolet light absorbers and the like.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the said composition has an enhanced oxygen absorbing capacity of well over 0.4ml/gm.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the oxygen scavenging composition comprising polyester resin is achieved by making use of melt mixing equipments like twin screw extruders.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the pelletized master batch of the oxygen scavenging composition is dried and stored under an inert atmosphere such as nitrogen for further use.<br>
The oxygen scavenging composition of the present invention gets triggered by the presence of moisture / water.<br>
Appropriate quantities of the oxygen scavenging composition in accordance with this invention can be incorporated in a dried polyester resin preferably selected from a group consisting of an alloy of PET with PTN or PBN or PBT or their copolyesters and blends preferably PET with PBN or PBT and more preferably with PTN prior to extrusion/injection molding/stretch blow molding. The quantities should be such that the final quantity of the iron particle mix in the polyester resin should be in the region of 2500 ppm to 3500 ppm.<br>
16<br><br>
PTN's excellent passive barrier property compared to the other polymers towards gases are well known.<br>
Table - I gives the comparison of the oxygen permeability of the different polyesters. As a carrier for the oxygen scavenger in the present invention PTN is preferred for the master batch because of its superior barrier property towards oxygen and the presence of PTN will augment the function of the iron particle mixture of the present invention.<br>

The present invention, the active oxygen scavenger developed and described in die present invention has increased oxygen absorption rate and is effective in its application at lesser loadings thereby improving the characteristics of the packaging eg. botde.<br>
Since the oxygen scavenging composition in accordance with tiiis invention is activated by contact with water or water vapor, mono layered single walled barrier bottles or containers made of polyester resin impregnated with the oxygen scavenging composition can be useful for packing highly oxygen sensitive food items such as alcoholic beverages, fruit juices and health beverages which require total absence of<br>
oxygen for the duration of intended shelf life.<br>
17<br><br>
A particular feature of the invention is that since part of the iron composition is nano sized and similar in size to the wavelength of light they do not affect the clarity of the container. Also the presence of nano sized iron particles in the master batch developed and described herein surprisingly also acts as a passive barrier in addition to its main active barrier function.<br>
The invention is further explained in the form of following examples. However, this examples should not in any way be considered as limiting the scope of the invention, since, this examples are of exemplary in nature.<br>
Example 1<br>
20 g of iron powder consisting of a mixture of particle sizes of ~6 micron, -24 micron and 10 nm in the ratio of 10:70:20 were refluxed with the n-butanol for 12 hours. 200 mg of sodium bisulfate, 80 mg of sodium<br>
chloride were added along with 6 ml of water and further refluxed for 3 hours. Following this the alcohol was distilled off and the mixed iron powder impregnated with the bisulfate and the metal halide was dried at 75°C and the resulting dry powder was stored under nitrogen. This dry oxygen scavenger was found to be capable of absorbing oxygen in the presence of moisture.<br>
The iron particle mix component of the oxygen scavenging composition was incorporated in carrier resin preforms and bottles made therefrom were tested for oxygen absorption by the gas chromatographic method.<br>
The efficiency data of the Oxygen Scavenging component of the present invention in relation to known compositions was tabulated in the following Table - II, which was evaluated by a specially designed manometric method to provide a qualitative figure of oxygen absorption by Oxygen Scavenger also by a gas chromatographic procedure to obtain quantitative values in comparison with the theoretical values.<br>

Note:<br>
(i)       In U tube manometer the mm Hg rise is directly proportional to the quantity of Oxygen absorbed by the oxygen scavenger.<br>
19<br><br>
(ii) For gas chromatographic (GC) procedure, oxygen scavenger incorporated performs or bottles are powdered or cut into pieces and a known quantity is taken in a vial. To this a known quantity of water is added and heated to 60°C for 2 hours for acceleration of oxygen absorption. The head space air sample is analyzed by GC at definite time intervals.<br>
(iii) The theoretical quantity of oxygen capable of being absorbed by the oxygen scavenger is based on the oxygen absorption value of 300 ml per gram of iron.<br>
(iv) The ml/g value is another way of expressing the oxygen scavenging capacity which helps to compare with the published values for oxygen scavenger samples of the prior art.<br>
The delayed action by the presence of the mixed micron sized iron particles as described in this invention is elaborated in the following Table - III. Example 1 was repeated with different compositions of the mixture of micron sized iron particles. Nano sized particles were not added so that the influence of the proportion of different sizes of micron particles can be clearly seen.<br>

It is seen from the table that the oxygen absorption rate distinctly differs with the micron size and that the  rate is less for the finer micron size. This delayed action is<br>
20<br><br>
advantageous for the alcoholic beverage like beer in the container as the oxygen scavengers capacity will last throughout the period of storing the alcoholic beer and protect the beer from oxygen ingress.<br>
The oxygen scavenger (OS) incorporated in the master batch with a carrier resin was blended with PET having different passive barrier additives and injection molded into preforms and subsequently stretch blow molded into bottles. The OS containing preforms and bottles were tested for their oxygen absorption capability by GC. Results are given in Table - IV.<br>

2.	Oxygen Scavenger at 2200 ppm (24:6 micron of 2000:200) in a PET carrier resin containing 5 % PTN<br>
3.	Oxygen Scavenger at 3400 ppm in a PET carrier resin containing 8 % PTN and 1000 ppm nano silica as an additional passive barrier additive<br>
4.	Oxygen Scavenger at 3400 ppm in a PET carrier resin containing 8 % PTN and 500 ppm each of nano silica and nano clay as additional passive barrier additives.<br>
It follows from the table that the oxygen absorption by the OS in the bottles are generally about 40 - 65 % of the theoretical absorption which is understandable as the oxygen absorbing iron is dispersed in the polymer matrix and may not be easily available for combination with oxygen especially in the short period of testing time.<br>

In Examples 1 to 7 the carrier resin for making the MB was PET-PTN alloy. The Oxygen Scavenging capacities in these experiments followed the order Example 7&gt;1&gt;5&gt;4&gt;2&gt;3&gt;6.<br>
Similar experiments i.e. 1 to 7 were carried out with PET-PBN alloy instead of the PET-PTN alloy. Though the trend of Oxygen Scavenging capacities were same in these experiments the Oxygen Scavenging efficiency was observed to be ~ 10% less than that observed with PET-PTN alloy as the carrier.<br>
Experiments were also conducted to judge the performance of the Oxygen Scavenging composition with different % compositions of PTN as well as in different size of bottles. The oxygen absorption results obtained by Gas Chromatography are given in Table-V.<br>

As can be seen from the Table above the various preforms and bottles which contain the oxygen scavenger show sufficient oxygen absorption which is satisfactory taking into consideration the presence of the oxygen scavenger iron particles mixture well dispersed in the polymer matrix.<br>
Several advantages arise as a result of the oxygen scavenging composition of the present invention.<br>
1.	The composition increases the oxygen absorbing rates due to the presence of nano sized iron particles which are so small and their aspect ratio is so high that properties improve with lower loadings of the oxygen scavenger as compared to the use of only micron sized particles.<br>
2.	The oxygen scavenging composition of the present invention enhances the barrier properties of the polyester resin by slowing down the permeation of gas molecules through the resin matrix.<br>
3.	The oxygen scavenging composition of the present invention is of low cost and has an improved efficiency.<br>
4.	The oxygen scavenging composition of the present invention is used to provide active as well as passive oxygen barred packaging containers that can increase the shelf-life of oxygen-sensitive human consumption products by absorbing oxygen present inside the head-space of the container as well as from the container wall in addition to absorbing oxygen permeating from the outside.<br><br>
5.	In the present composition, the limitations in the form of coloration, bottle blowing difficulty, loss of strength in the bottles and decreased barrier performance in the bottles are overcome by adopting the oxygen scavenging composition having a combination of nano and micron sized metal particles.<br>
6.	In the present composition, the presence of mixed micron size particles of iron in addition to the nano sized particles, helps in a delayed action of the oxygen scavenger to take care of the oxygen ingress during prolonged storage.<br>
7.	The polyester carriers like an alloy of PET with PTN, PBN and PBT used in making the master batch containing the oxygen scavenger also play a role by their passive barrier effect in oxygen ingress. The preferred carrier resin is a PET-PTN alloy blend due to its excellent barrier property.<br>
24<br><br>
8.        The Fe based OS particles in the PET-PTN carrier resin is stable and in the bottle gets triggered by moisture / water thus giving a reasonable shelf life for the resin and bottle.<br>
