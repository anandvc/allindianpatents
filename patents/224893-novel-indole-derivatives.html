				<td>Novel indole derivatives.<br>
The present invention relates to novel heteroaryl derivatives potently binding to the 5-HTlA receptor, pharmaceutical compositions containing these compounds and the use thereof for the treatment of certain psychiatric and neurological disorders. Many of the compounds of the invention have also potent serotonin reuptake inhibition activity and are thus considered particularly useful for the treatment of depression.<br>
Furthermore, many compounds of the invention have also effect at dopamine D3 and D4 receptors and are considered to be useful for the treatment of psychosis.<br>
Background Art<br>
Clinical and pharmacological studies have shown that 5-HTJA agonists and partial agonists are useful in the treatment of a range of affective disorders such as generalised anxiety disorder, panic disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, depression and aggression.<br>
It has also been reported that 5-HT1A ligands may be useful in the treatment of ischaemia.<br>
An overview of 5-HT1A antagonists and proposed potential therapeutic targets for these antagonists based upon preclinical and clinical data are presented by Schechter et al. Serotonin 1997, Vol.2, Issue 7. It is stated that 5-HTJA antagonists may be useful in the treatment of schizophrenia, senile dementia, dementia associated with Alzheimer's disease, and in combination with SSRI antidepressants also to be useful in the treatment of depression.<br>
5-HT reuptake inhibitors are well-known antidepressant drugs and useful for the treatment of panic disorders and social phobia.<br>
The effect of combined administration of a compound that inhibits serotonin reuptake and a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist has been evaluated in several studies (Innis, R.B. et al. Eur. J. Pharmacol 1987,143, p 195-204 and Gartside, SB. Br. J. Pharmacol 1995,115, p 1064-1070, Blier, P. et aL Trends Pharmacol Sci. 1994, 75, 220). In these studies it was found<br><br>
that combined 5-HT1A receptor antagonists and serotonin reuptake inhibitors would produce a more rapid onset of therapeutic action.<br>
Dopamine D4 receptors belong to the family of dopamine D2-like receptors which is considered to be responsible for the antipsychotic effects of neuroleptics. Dopamine D4 receptors are primarily located in areas of the brain other than striatum, suggesting that dopamine D4 receptor ligands have antipsychotic effect and are devoid of extrapyramidal activity.<br>
Accordingly, dopamine D4 receptor ligands are potential drugs for the treatment of psychosis and positive symptoms of schizophrenia and compounds with combined effects at dopamine D4, and serotonergic receptors may have the further benefit of improved effect on negative symptoms of schizophrenia, such as anxiety and depression, alcohol abuse, impulse control disorders, aggression, side effects induced by conventional antipsychotic agents, ischaemic disease states, migraine, senile dementia and cardiovascular disorders and in the improvement of sleep.<br>
Dopamine D3 receptors also belong to the family of dopamine D2-like receptors. D3 antagonistic properties of an antipsychotic drug could reduce the negative symptoms and cognitive deficits and result in an improved side effect profile with respect to EPS and hormonal changes.<br>
Accordingly, agents acting on the 5-HTi A receptor, both agonists and antagonists, are believed to be of potential use in the therapy of psychiatric and neurological disorders and thus being highly desired. Furthermore, antagonists, at the same time having potent serotonin reuptake inhibition activity and/or D4 and/or D3 activity, may be particularly useful for the treatment of various psychiatric and neurological diseases.<br>
Previously, closely related structures have been reported:<br>
WO 9955672 discloses a general formula in which indole derivatives having 5-HT1A<br>
receptor and D2 receptor affinity are included<br>
EP 900792 discloses a general formula in which indole derivatives axe embraced as 5-HT1A<br>
and 5-HTID as well as D2 receptor ligands.<br><br>
It has now been found that a class of indole derivatives is particularly useful as 5-HT1A ligands. Furthermore, it has been found that many of these compounds have other highly beneficial properties as e.g. potent serotonin reuptake inhibition activity and/or affinity for the D4 receptor.<br>

3H-5-carboxamido tryptarnine (3H-5-CT) to cloned human 5-HT1A receptors stably expressed in transfected HeLa cells (HA7) (Fargin, A. et al. J. Biol. Chem. 1989,264, 14848) is determined in vitro. The assay was performed as a modification of the method described by Harrington, M.A. et al. 1 Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994, 268, 1098. Human 5-HT1A receptors (40 u.g of cell homogenate) were incubated for 15 minutes at 37 °C in 50 mM Tris buffer at pH 7.7 in the presence of H-5-CT. Non-specific binding was determined by including 10 μm of metergoline. The reaction was terminated by rapid filtration through Unifilter GF/B filters on a Tomtec Cell Harvester. Filters were counted in a Packard Top Counter.  Compounds Id, 2b, 2e and 2o were tested and showed IC50 values of less than 50 nM.<br>
The compounds of the invention have also been tested for their effect on re-uptake of serotonin in the following test:<br><br>
Using this method, the ability of drugs to inhibit the accumulation of 3H-5-HT into whole rat brain synaptosomes is determined in vitro. The assay was performed as described by Hyttel, J. Psychopharmacology 1978, 60, 13. Compounds la, Id, 11, 2b, 2e and 2o were tested and showed IC1-6 values of less than 20 nM.<br>
The 5-HT1A antagonistic activity of some of the compounds of the invention has been estimated in vitro at cloned 5-HT1A receptors, stably expressed in transfected HeLa cells (HA7). In this test, 5-HT1A antagonistic activity is estimated by measuring the ability of the compounds to antagonize the 5-HT induced inhibition of forskolin induced cAMP accumulation. The assay was performed as a modification of the method described by Pauwels, PJ. et al. Biochem. Pharmacol 1993,45,375, Compounds la, Id, 11,2b and 2e were tested and showed IC50 values of less than 7000 nM.<br>
Some of the compounds of the invention have also been tested for their in vivo effect on 5-HT1A receptors in the assay described by Sanchez. C. et al. Eur. X Pharmacol 1996,315, pp 245. In this test, antagonistic effects of test compounds are determined by measuring the ability of the test compounds to inhibit 5-MeO-DMT induced 5-HT syndrome.<br><br>
The compounds of the present invention possess valuable activity as serotonin re-uptake inhibitors and have antagonistic effect at 5-HT1A receptors. The compounds of the invention are therefore considered useful for the treatment of diseases and disorders responsive to the inhibition of serotonin re-uptake and antagonistic activity at 5-HT1A receptors. Diseases responsive to the inhibition of serotonin re-uptake are well-known in the art and include affective disorders, such as depression, psychosis, anxiety disorders including general anxiety disorder, panic disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, etc.<br>
As explained above, the antagonistic activity at 5-HT1A receptors of the compounds of the invention will counteract the negative feed back mechanμm induced by the inhibition of serotonin reuptake and is thereby expected to improve the effect of the serotonin reuptake inhibiting activity of the compounds of the invention.<br>
The compounds as claimed herein are therefore considered to be particularly useful as fast onset of action medicaments for the treatment of depression. The compounds may also be useful for the treatment of depressions which are non-responsive to currently available SSRIs.<br>
Some of the compounds of the invention have also been found to have affinity to dopamine D3 and D4 receptors in the following two assays.<br><br>
By this method, the inhibition by drugs of the binding of [3H]YM-09151-2 (0.06 nM) to membranes of human cloned dopamine D4.2 receptors expressed in CHO-cells is determined in vitro. Method modified from NEN Life Science Products, Inc., technical data certificate PC2533-10/96.<br><br>
By this method, the inhibition by drugs of the binding [3H]Spiperone (0.3 nM) to membranes of human cloned dopamine D3-receptors expressed in CHO-cells is determined<br><br>
in vitro. Method modified from R.G. MacKenzie et al. Eur. J. Pharm.-Mol. Pharm. Sec. 1994,266, 79-85.<br>
Some of the compounds of the invention have also been tested for their in vivo effect on 5-HT1A receptors in the assay described by Sanchez, C. et al. Eur. J. Pharmacol 1996, 315, pp 245. In this test, antagonistic effects of test compounds are determined by measuring the ability of the test compounds to inhibit 5-MeO-DMT induced 5-HT syndrome.<br>
Accordingly, as the compounds of the invention show affinities in the described tests, they are considered usefid in the treatment of affective disorders, such as depression, generalised anxiety disorder, panic disorder, obsessive compulsive disorders, social phobia and eating disorders, and neurological disorders such as psychosis.<br><br><br><br>
