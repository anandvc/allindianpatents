Field of the invention<br>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for analysing samples of biological<br>
material. More particularly, it concerns the investigation of processes in samples such as<br>
cells, in a way that may not interfere with cell functioning. Such investigation may<br>
provide greater understanding of complex processes in life science and medicine, assist the<br>
evaluation of new drug candidates, and enable the detection of disease or abnormal<br>
processes.<br>
Background<br>
Examination of live samples provides access to the dynamics of cellular and sub-cellular<br>
processes. The study of small-scale cellular processes has typically been carried out using<br>
light microscopy.<br>
In some cases, the complexity of the processes is such that tools are required to isolate<br>
specific types of processes which can be studied in isolation, or in combination with a<br>
small number of other processes. The use of labels (in the form of fluorescent molecules in<br>
fluorescence microscopy) has provided tools of this nature.<br>
A label may be extrinsic (that is, added to a sample) or intrinsic (such as a molecule which is present in the sample that is inherently distinctively coloured or fluorescent).<br><br>
A fluorescent molecule has a specific excitation spectrum, being more strongly excited at<br>
some wavelengths and less strongly excited at others. It also has a specific emission<br>
spectrum, emitting more intensely at some wavelengths, and less intensely at others. The<br>
excitation and emission spectra may range from the ultraviolet to the infrared.<br><br>
 A wide range of fluorescent labels have been developed from chemical molecules, such as<br>
Rhodarnine and Fluorescein. Further fluorescent labels have been developed from<br>
molecules found in luminescent organisms, for example the Aequorea Jellyfish which has<br>
provided the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), and various corals providing DsRed and<br>
HcRed. These have been termed AFPs (Aequorea Fluorescent Proteins).<br>
The fluorescent labels may be associated with specific molecules of interest (DNA, RNA,<br>
proteins, carbohydrates, antibodies, etc). Alternatively they may be made to-be sensitive to<br>
certain characteristics (such as ionic concentration, pH, voltage potential, temperature, the<br>
presence of a specific enzyme, the presence of specific enzyme substrates, force), altering<br>
their fluorescent properties according to these characteristics. These labels may be<br>
introduced into cells by passing through the cell membrane or by injection. Alternatively<br>
they may be formed internally as part of the normal functioning of the cell, in the case of<br>
the genetically encoded labels such as the AFPs.<br>
In a known apparatus for imaging samples as shown in Figure la, a microscope 10 is fitted<br>
with a light source 12 for illuminating a sample 4b. It may be in the form of a lamp, laser<br>
or light emitting diode, for example. The microscope is fitted with optical filters 14 so<br>
that the light emanating from the sample may be observed at selected wavebands.<br>
Examination of the spatial and temporal distribution of light from the sample may provide<br>
information on the structure and dynamics of the sample.<br>
Phase contrast illumination may be employed to enhance imaging of thin samples.<br>
Polarised light may be used to permit the visualisation of very thin samples with small<br>
refractive index changes, for example using differential interference contrast (DIC)<br>
techniques.<br>
The microscope is fitted with an image acquisition system, comprising a light sensitive<br>
detector 16 (sensitive from the ultraviolet to the infrared) such as a CCD camera, and<br>
recording means such as a video recorder or computer 18 with a memory device 20, so<br>
that dynamic behaviour of the sample may be captured and analysed offline. For example,<br>
the velocity, distance travelled and path of moving parts of the sample may be monitored.<br><br>
The system may employ a focus drive mechanism for altering the position of the imaging<br>
focus plane. Various algorithms may be used to establish and maintain the optical focal<br>
plane. Volumetric (XYZ) and volumetric time series (XYZT) data may be acquired using<br>
deconvolution techniques. By selecting suitable excitation wavebands and/or selecting<br>
suitable optical filter sets, volumetric multi-wavelength (XYWZ) and volumetric multi-<br>
wavelength time series (XYWZT) data may be acquired.<br>
Operations of the microscope are controlled by a microscope controller 24 in response to<br>
commands from processing means in the form of computer 18. Instructions may be<br>
entered into the computer by a user using keyboard 26, a mouse 28 and a display 30.<br>
By way of example, Figure la shows control lines extending from the controller to the<br>
microscope for aspects such as filter selection along line 32, selection of an objective lens<br>
34, 34' along line 36, focus along line 22, a liquid dispenser 38 along line 40, an<br>
environmental unit 42 along line 44 for modifying environmental conditions of a sample<br>
46, and a sample transport unit 48 for moving the sample 46 relative to a lens of the<br>
microscope by control via line 50.<br>
The apparatus may also include an activation light source 52 for generating an activating<br>
light beam 54 for use as discussed below. The direction of the activating light beam may<br>
be adjusted by a guide 56.<br>
The activating light beam 54 is incident on a dichroic mirror 60. The mirror directs the<br>
beam towards an objective lens 34, and the beam is then incident on the sample 46. Light<br>
emanating from the sample 46 passes back through the objective lens 34, but is not<br>
diverted by mirror 60 so that is passes through a filter 14 before impinging on detector 16.<br>
An output signal from the detector 16 is fed to the computer 18 along line 62. <br>
The environmental unit 42 may control the temperature of the sample, and/or the<br>
composition and flow of gas over the sample, for example.<br><br>
Software loaded onto the computer enables it to acquire image data carried on the output<br>
signal from the detector.<br>
The software also allows the user to select parameters for the operation of various aspects<br>
of the apparatus, such as the activating light beam, for example.<br>
The controller allows the activating light beam to be directed by the setting of one or more<br>
of the following parameters:<br>
•	the one or more regions of interest on the sample (location, size and shape)<br>
•	the wavebands<br>
•	the power level<br>
•"	the time of start of activation<br>
•	the duration of activation<br>
•	the number of repeat activation cycles<br>
•	the delay between activation cycles.<br>
The computer permits recording of the image data from the detector via a digitiser at a<br>
given data rate. The filter sets in the microscope and the waveband of the illuminating<br>
light source 12 may be controlled to permit acquisition of data sets of one or more<br>
wavelengths.<br>
A known apparatus for imaging biological samples including fluorescent labels is shown in<br>
Figure lb. It is similar to the apparatus shown in Figure la. However, instead of<br>
iUumination light source 12, it includes an excitation light source 11, which generates a<br>
light beam 55. This light source is capable of exciting one or more fluorescent labels<br>
present in the sample by irradiating them with one or more specific wavebands. Filters 14<br>
may be chosen so as to pass light emitted by labels at selected wavebands.<br>
Figure 1c illustrates attachment of a fluorescent label 2, 2' to a component of interest 4, 4'<br>
in a sample 6. Multiple labels may be used to provide information on the coincident<br><br>
localisation of labelled components, revealing, for example, the organization of the<br>
cytoskeleton of a cell.<br>
The excitation light source 11 employed in the apparatus of Figure 1 may be pulsed and<br>
the detector may be fitted with a gating device, so that the time taken for a fluorescent<br>
label to emit light following the pulse may be used to distinguish between different labels<br>
in a technique termed fluorescent lifetime imaging (FLIM) [ref. R. Cubedda, J. Phys. D:<br>
Appl, Phys., 2002, Vol. 35, R61-R76].<br>
An activating light beam 54 may enable a deeper understanding of the dynamic processes<br>
in a sample such as a living cell (in many cases this may be based on the excitation light<br>
source) to be obtained. The activating light beam may be directed to portions of the<br>
sample in such a manner that the intense light from this beam alters the sample and/or<br>
bleaches labels present in the sample and reduces their fluorescence. By observing the<br>
subsequent changes in the light emanating from this region, and/or elsewhere in the<br>
sample, information can be obtained on mechanisms of interaction and/or exchange of<br>
various labelled components.<br>
The beam may act to perforate a cell wall to allow the entry of an external agent, to dissect<br>
all or part of the cell, to destroy all or part of the cell, or to change the environment of the<br>
sample.<br>
A graph plotting the intensity of fluorescence at a bleached region against time is shown in<br>
Figure 1d.<br>
For example, the rapid recovery of fluorescence at the bleached portion suggests to what<br>
extent the label is free to return to the region. The mechanism, diffusion or local<br>
synthesis, may be determined by estimation of diffusion rates and the mobile fraction [ref.<br>
AxelRod,.Biophys. J., 1977, Vol. 18, pp. 129-131.].<br>
Further analysis and experimentation may provide access to information about molecular<br>
binding rates, assembly/disassembly and transport mechanisms [ref. J. Lippincott-Schwartz<br><br>
et al, Nature Supp Imaging in Cell Biol, Sept 2003, S7-S14.]. Such techniques are popular<br>
to explore the dynamics and regulation of processes in cells, for example protein<br>
trafficking, lifetime and fate (recycling and breakdown).<br>
Conventionally, such bleaching techniques may be applied as a "bleaching protocol"<br>
comprising four phases as illustrated in Figure le:<br>
(1)	a pre-bleach phase in which the sample is imaged using normal fluorescence for a<br>
period of time;<br>
(2)	a bleach phase during which the activating light beam is directed to iUuminate a<br>
predefined region with light of a specific wavelength with a specified higher power<br>
level for a certain period of time;<br>
(3)	a post-bleach phase in which the sample is again imaged using normal fluorescence<br>
for a period of time; and<br>
(4)	an analysis phase in which the data which has been collected is processed to<br>
determine parameters of interest, such as diffusion rate and mobile fraction<br>
according to fluorescence intensity in various regions on the image at various time<br>
points.<br>
A set of related techniques are commonly referred to as FRAP (Fluorescence recovery<br>
after photo-bleaching). Variants of the basic protocol may be used to further explore the<br>
system, by repeated bleaching of the same region, and bleaching other portions etc (FLAP,<br>
FLIP, iFRAP) [ref. J. Lippincott-Schwartz et al, see above; Phair et al, Nature, 2000,<br>
Vol. 404, pp. 604-609.].<br>
Alternatively, a label in the sample, the sample itself or its environment may comprise a<br>
caged compound that releases an active group when ihuminated by the activating light<br>
beam - a process known as uncaging [ref. J.C. Politz, Trend Cell Biol., 1999, Vol. 9, pp.<br>
284-287.]. The active group may be a fluorescent label. Alternatively, the active group<br><br>
may not be a fluorescent label, for example the active group may instead affect the pH of<br>
the sample. The active group may have an indirectly visible or otherwise measurable<br>
effect on the sample.<br>
In addition a technique known as pattern photo-bleaching may be using to observe changes<br>
in structure [ref. J. Ellenberg et al, Nature Supp Imaging in Cell Biol, Sept 2003,<br>
S14-S19.]. In this technique, the bleaching process is used to introduce visually distinctive<br>
landmark patterns on part of the sample, for example a grid, movement of which may be<br>
tracked over time to understand, for example, mechanisms of membrane deformation or<br>
shear.<br>
Recent developments in fluorescent probes has resulted in new labels (photo-switchable<br>
labels) which are sensitive to the incident light, in such as way that they change their<br>
optical properties, altering their emission spectrum and/or their excitation spectrum.<br>
Examples include the photo-activatable GFP (PA-GFP) and Kaede [ref. J. Lippincott-<br>
Schwartz et al, see above.]. Furthermore, some of these probes allow their properties to be<br>
altered reversibly or irreversibly. Such probes may be activated (made to emit more<br>
intensely), or quenched (made to emit less intensely) in different wavebands. For example<br>
the kindling FP KFP1 [ref. D.M. Chudakov et al, J. Biol. Chem., 2003, Vol. 278(9), pp.<br>
7215-7219.].<br>
Instrumentation has'been developed with an adapted activating light beam to excite photo-<br>
switchable labels and force them to undergo the change in optical properties. This may, for<br>
example, be useful in revealing or hiding labelled components during the course of an<br>
experiment and in studying long term processes such as organism development [ref. D.M.<br>
Chudakov et al, Nature Biotechnology, Feb 2003, Vol. 21, pp. 191-194.].<br>
Hereinafter, the term photo-modification will be used to include photo-bleaching and its<br>
variants (FRAP, iFRAP, FLIP, FLAP), photo-activation, photo-switching, and pattern<br>
photo-bleaching.<br><br>
Conventional control of an activating light beam involves setting up a number of activation<br>
i<br>
parameters and requires the user to be able to estimate the appropriate values. In general,<br>
these are determined by trial and error using surplus material. It may be desired to set the<br>
depth of activation to be say 30% (as is the case in the illustration of Figure Id) and the<br>
appropriate laser power setting and duration must be determined to achieve this.<br>
Similarly, the recovery time of the curve will determine the appropriate sampling regime<br>
in the post-bleach period (number of images, interval between images) which in turn is<br>
determined by the diffusion coefficient.<br>
These activation parameters must be defined prior to the experiment. They cannot be<br>
adapted to suit changing conditions. This means that the approach can only be applied to<br>
changing samples by trial and error. Thus fast changes and/or rare events can be extremely<br>
difficult to study.<br>
In addition, in existing photo-bleaching procedures, the recovery after bleaching prevents<br>
long time course experiments (10mins+) in the tracking of change since the labels recover<br>
over shorter periods and thereafter there is no discernible bleached area.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The present invention provides a method of analysing a sample of biological material using<br>
apparatus including processing means, comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	irradiating the sample with electromagnetic and/or ionizing radiation;<br>
(b)	detecting electromagnetic radiation emanating from the sample and generating a<br>
signal in response thereto; and<br>
(c)	modifying the sample, labels in the sample and/or the environmental conditions of<br>
the sample with the apparatus in response to user input after the beginning of step (a)<br>
and/or in response to analysis by the processing means of the signal generated in<br>
radiation detection step (b).<br>
The present invention may enable combination of imaging, measurement of one or more<br>
characteristics in the images collected, and modification of the sample, labels in the<br><br>
sample, and/or the environmental conditions of the sample, with manual and/or automatic<br>
determination of the modification parameters according to the measurement made.<br>
In comparison, conventional systems require the user to enter modification parameters<br>
manually before the start of the experiment, and so prevent dynamic setting and<br>
modification of those parameters, and thus interactive probing of complex systems.<br>
Thus, in accordance with the invention, such modifications may be determined and<br>
executed "in real time", interactively, as the experiment progresses. This flexibility<br>
allows longer time course experiments to be conducted. It also allows rare, brief and/or<br>
rapid events to be detected and acted upon, such as all fertilisation or mutation events.<br>
Events that are difficult for a human operator to detect, such as coincident events can be<br>
detected and acted upon.<br>
Where the present method is carried out using a light microscope, the irradiation is<br>
provided by an Ulumination light source. The electromagnetic radiation emanating from<br>
the sample may in that case be in the form of light transmitted by the sample if ihuminated<br>
from below, or reflected light if the same is illuminated from above.<br>
In a preferred approach, the sample includes fluorescent labels, step (a) comprises<br>
irradiating the sample with excitation energy, and step (b) comprises detecting fluorescent<br>
radiation emitted by labels in the sample when excited by the excitation energy.<br>
The excitation energy may be in the form of electromagnetic energy (preferably light) or<br>
ionizing radiation, for example.<br>
The modification step (c) may comprise irradiating at least a portion of the sample with an<br>
energy beam. If labels are present in the sample, this beam may be selected such that the<br>
fluorescence of labels in the portion is reduced or "bleached". In a particular embodiment,<br>
steps (a) to (c) are-repeated after step (c), the period of time between the end of step (c)<br>
and the start of step (a) and/or the parameters of step (c) when repeated being dependent<br>
on said analysis by the processing means.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment, me apparatus operates so as to cycle between irradiation and<br>
modification phases, and the resultant change in the appearance of the sample is detected.<br>
In another approach, the modification step (c) comprises irradiating at least a portion of the<br>
sample with an energy beam so as to modify the optical properties of photo-switchable<br>
fluorescent labels in the portion.<br>
For example, it may be desirable to measure intra-cell diffusion many times over an<br>
extended period. Repeating a known FRAP experiment would have a cumulative photo-<br>
bleaching effect; soon the cell would not be visible. Using photo-switchable labels, a<br>
region can be switched rather than bleached. According to the present invention, a<br>
diffusion (or other) process may be measured, and when it is determined by the processing •<br>
means that the process and/or its measurement is complete, the photo-switchable labels<br>
may be "quenched", returning them to their original state, before repeating the process.<br>
By avoiding repeated photo-bleaching a sample can be imaged for longer, and the present<br>
invention enables a process to be repeated and/or a series of measurements to be carried<br>
out in response to detected fluorescent radiation over a prolonged period.<br>
Avoidance of repeated photo-bleaching is also beneficial as an activating light beam is<br>
often intense and its use may result in damage to the sample, or the creation of reactive<br>
species such a singlet oxygen, which may perturb the process under study, requiring<br>
sophisticated control experiments, and is thus not truly non-invasive. [Ref. D E Wolf, M<br>
Edidin, P R Dragsten, 1980, and Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77: 2043-2045.]<br>
t.<br>
After step (c), the environmental conditions of the sample may again be changed and the<br>
light emanating from the sample thereafter detected for analysis.<br>
In another embodiment, the environmental change is selected to cause labels in the sample<br>
to release a substance.	|<br><br>
In a further embodiment, the environmental change is selected to modify the manner in<br>
which the sample and/or labels in the sample respond to irradiation. For example, it may<br>
change the colour of the sample or the excitation spectrum and/or emission spectrum of<br>
labels in the sample. In particular the environmental change may be controlled activation<br>
light.<br>
The ability to modify the response of the labels in the course of a process may avoid a<br>
need to physically introduce labels during the experiment. The procedures for introducing<br>
the labels into the sample during an experiment are quite difficult to master, requiring<br>
additional equipment, knowledge and skill on the part of the user. Experiments often have<br>
to be repeated many times. In the case of microinjection, such procedures are also invasive<br>
to the sample. It can be seen that interactive modification of labels already present in the<br>
sample may not require physical introduction of additional labels. Labels may be activated<br>
or "switched on" in a selected region.<br>
In a further preferred approach, the modification step (c) comprises modifying the physical .<br>
structure of at least part of the sample. For example, this may involve forming an opening<br>
in a membrane of a selected cell in the sample to allow material to pass therethrough. The<br>
opening may be formed using a localised energy beam such as a laser,, for example. In<br>
this way, an individual cell may be selected in the sample which is exhibiting behaviour of<br>
interest, and the user can form an opening in the cell wall to allow in material in response<br>
to that behaviour. The intensity of the energy beam is preferably selected such that the cell<br>
membrane is able to close or "heal" the opening shortly after its formation. Forming an<br>
opening in a cell in this way to allow the ingress of genetic material is often referred to as<br>
"transfection".<br>
The opening may allow agents such as labels into the cell to interact wim or to highlight a<br>
specific structure and/or process in the cell, or otherwise alter its optical properties. It<br>
may allow genetic material to pass into the cell. Alternatively, material may be allowed to<br>
pass into the cell so as to kill it.<br><br>
In contrast to dispensing a liquid into a sample to alter the composition of the sample as a<br>
whole, modification of an individual structure such as a cell is permitted using the<br>
technique described above. It may also be employed in combination with liquid<br>
dispensing, whereby the liquid dispensing step provides the material which passes through<br>
the opening formed by the energy beam.<br>
The environmental conditions of the sample to be changed may be its temperature, the<br>
concentration of a certain ion, the pH of the sample, the voltage potential of the sample,<br>
the presence of a specific enzyme, or the pressure of the sample. Labels in the sample<br>
may be sensitive to these conditions and activate when a predetermined range is reached.<br>
In another embodiment, the environment of the sample is changed by altering the<br>
composition of the gas adjacent to the sample. For example, labels in the sample may be<br>
activated by exposure to a predetermined gas or concentration of a predetermined gas,<br>
such as oxygen.<br>
In a further embodiment, the environment of the sample is changed by irradiating it with<br>
activation energy.<br>
The sample may be irradiated with an activation energy beam arranged to irradiate a<br>
selected portion of the sample. The beam may define a pattern, such as a grid, for<br>
example.<br>
A parameter (or parameters) of the activation energy- irradiation determined by the<br>
processor may be one or more of the following examples: the start time of the irradiation;<br>
the portion of the sample to be irradiated; the waveband(s) of the energy; the power level;<br>
the duration of the irradiation; the number of repeat cycles of the activation irradiation<br>
energy; and the delay between repeat cycles.<br>
The modification carried out in step (c) of a process embodying the invention may be<br>
applied to a region of the sample selected in response to the user input and/or the analysis<br>
by the processing means.<br><br>
A parameter of the modification of step (c) may be determined by the processing means<br>
with reference to data stored by the apparatus.<br>
In a further implementation, the modification of step (c) is dependent on detection of the<br>

Preferably, data generated by the analysis by the processing means is stored by the<br>
apparatus so as to facilitate reference thereto in deterrrrirring a parameter of a subsequent<br>

identify a specific location in a sample for a modification by tiie modification means.<br>
Detailed description of the invention	»<br>
Prior art and embodiments of the invention will now be described by way of example with<br>
reference to the accompanying schematic drawings, wherein:<br>
Figure la shows a block diagram of a known light microscopy apparatus for investigating<br>
processes in a sample;<br>
Figure lb shows a block diagram of a known fluorescence microscopy apparatus for<br>
investigating processes in a sample;<br>
Figure lc illustrates known use of fluorescent labels;<br>
Figure Id shows a typical bleach recovery curve for a fluorescent label;<br>
Figure le shows a flow diagram of a known bleaching protocol; and<br>
Figures 2 to 7 show flow diagrams of modification protocols according to respective<br>
embodiments of the invention.<br>
The embodiments described with reference to Figures 2 to 7 concern photo-modification of<br>
a sample and/or labels in a sample. It will be appreciated that the modification carried out<br>
in accordance with the invention may take other forms.<br>
Figures 2 to 7 represent diagrammatically protocols followed by processing means of a<br>
suitable apparatus, together with associated inputs and control outputs fed to other parts of<br>
the apparatus.<br>
Figure 2 shows a first embodiment of the invention, which allows interactive control of<br>
photo-modification. A user interface allows parameters to be set and/or modified during<br>
the running of the experiment. The parameters control operation of the activating light<br>
source and/or ancilliary devices such as the examples given in the Figure which may<br>
modify the sample, labels in the sample and/or the immediate environment of the sample.<br><br>
In an implementation in which the activating light beam bleaches fluorescent labels in the<br>
sample, this protocol may be termed "FRAP on demand".<br>
In the embodiment of Figure 2, the system allows the user to set the parameters of the<br>
activating light beam comprising, the region of interest on the sample, the waveband(s),<br>
the power level at those wavebands, and the duration of activation. The user is able to<br>
image the sample and determine the start time of activation by a suitable action such as a<br>
keypress.<br>
The user may be able to determine one or more of the duration or end of activation, the<br>
number of repeat cycles and the delay between cycles of activation, and the wavelength of<br>
the activation by a suitable action such as a key press.<br>
Furthermore, the user may be able to determine the location of activation and/or the size<br>
and shape of the irradiated region by suitable action such as manipulation of an input<br>
device such as a computer mouse.<br>
A label may have a temperature sensitive domain, and the sample may be held on a holder,<br>
the temperature of which may be controlled by the user via the computer to activate the<br>
labels at an appropriate point in a process.<br>
A label may be sensitive to gas such as oxygen, and the sample environmental unit<br>
controlled by the user via the computer to activate the labels in the course of an<br>
experiment.<br>
Figure 3 shows a second embodiment that allows the use of a knowledge base to assist the<br>
user in setting and/or modifying the parameters.<br>
In the embodiment of Figure 3, the system is as Figure 2, and additionally allows a less<br>
experienced user to set certain high level parameters of photo-modification parameters<br>
such as the type of label to be bleached, and the system uses a knowledge base to<br><br>
determine the low level parameters to be used by the hardware, such as the wavelength and<br>
power level.<br>
Additionally, a more experienced user may be able to modify the knowledge base.<br>
In an implementation in which the activating light beam bleaches fluorescent labels in the<br>
sample, this protocol may be termed "expert FRAP".<br>
Figure 4a shows a third embodiment that uses information extracted from the images<br>
collected during the pre-modification (observation) phase to set the photo-modification<br>
parameters.<br>
In an implementation in which the activating light beam bleaches fluorescent labels in the<br>
sample, this protocol may be termed "clever FRAP".<br>
Figure 4b shows the third embodiment implemented in the form of a state machine. Each<br>
phase in the protocol is repeated until an exit condition is met. For the pre-modification<br>
phase, the exit condition is when the image analysis module sends the start signal. For the<br>
modification phase, the exit condition is when the image analysis module sends the stop •<br>
signal. The additional parameters to send are not shown in this diagram.<br>
In the embodiment of Figures 4a and 4b, me system allows the user to set certain<br>
parameters of the activating light beam, whilst setting others on the basis of information<br>
extracted from the data acquired during the pre-modification phase. In particular, the<br>
image data may be analysed to detect an event such as the motion of a component in the<br>
sample such as a cell in order to trigger the activating light beam.<br>
The user may be able to determine the duration or end of activation by suitable action such<br>
as a key press!<br>
The data may be analysed to:<br><br>
determine- location of a moving portion of the sample to direct the activating light<br>
beam;<br>
determine a change in intensity of part of the sample to direct the activating light<br>
beam;<br>
determine relative change in intensity of part of the sample to direct the activating<br>
light beam;<br>
determine relative change in fluorescent lifetime of part of the sample to direct the<br>
activating light beam;<br>
locate one or more substructures of interest, such as cellular components,<br>
organelles, vesicles or other particles, where the location and/or size of the particle(s) is<br>
used to direct the activating light beam;<br>
locate one or more substructures of interest such as cellular components,<br>
organelles, vesicles or other particles, where the location, motion, shape, speed, direction,<br>
relative distance and/or size of the particle(s) is used to trigger the activating light beam;<br>
detect key events in the cell cycle (such as cell division, cell death, viral invasion,<br>
endoctyosis, exocytosis, tubulation, gene transfer etc.) and/or coincidence of more than<br>
one event to trigger the activating light beam;<br>
automatically control the instrument;<br>
direct the setting of the irradiation source;<br>
direct the setting of the emission wavelength. For example, by following changes<br>
in emission wavelength and adjusting the wavelength of the irradiation light to maximise<br>
the emission intensity of labels in a sample, it is possible to measure changes to<br>
characteristics of the sample and do so more effectively;<br>
direct the setting of the polarisation of the light;<br>
direct the setting of the focus drive mechanism and thus the plane of focus of the<br>
microscope;<br>
direct a sample transport mechanism;<br>
set the temperature of a sample heater; and<br>
control a liquid dispensing mechanism.<br>
The data may be preprocessed to remove distortions due to deformation or motion of all or<br>
part of the sample.<br><br>
Figure 5 shows a fourth embodiment in which an image analysis module processes the<br>
image data acquired at each phase to determine the most appropriate parameter settings,<br>
for example, the amount of light to in order to complete photo-modification.<br>
In the embodiment of Figure 5, the system allows the user to set certain parameters of the<br>
activating light beam, whilst the system sets others on the basis of information extracted<br>
from the data acquired during the pre-bleach phase, during the bleach phase, and during<br>
the post-bleach phase. In particular, the image data may be analysed to detect an event<br>
such as the change of a component in the sample in order to end a phase.<br>
Figure 6 shows a fifth embodiment in which the system moves from a monitor phase to a<br>
modification phase according to the information extracted from the images collected. In an<br>
implementation in which the activating light beam bleaches fluorescent labels in the<br>
sample, this protocol may be termed "automated FRAP".<br>
This is expected to be particularly useful when used in conjunction with photo-switching<br>
labels which can be activated and quenched repeatedly and used to track the lifecycle of<br>
individual components.<br>
In the embodiment of Figure 6, the system allows the switching between a monitor phase<br>
during which the sample is imaged using the excitation light source, and a modification<br>
phase, during which the sample is imaged using the activating light source. The transition<br>
between the two phases and parameters for the phase is determined by the analysis of the .<br>
image data collected.<br>
Figure 7 shows a sixth embodiment in which the system moves from a monitor phase to a<br>
modification phase according to the information extracted from the images acquired and<br>
collects the information about the sample behaviour to the activating beam at a number of<br>
parameter settings so as to set up the knowledge base mentioned in Figure 3. In an<br>
implementation in which the activating light beam bleaches fluorescent labels in the<br>
sample, this protocol may be termed "autoconfig FRAP".<br><br>
In the embodiment of Figure 7, the system allows the control of the pre-modification<br>
phase, modification phase, post-modification phase and analysis phase as described in<br>
relation to Figure 5. The parameters used at each stage are those that permit an exploration<br>
of the possible parameters of the sample so as to quickly and efficiently determine the<br>
hardware settings (laser power, modification duration, etc) by an iterative process, and<br>
these settings are passed to knowledge base mentioned in connection with Figure 3. With<br>
the appropriate filter sets, the system may be able to image during the modification phase,<br>
for example during a bleach process, to monitor the parameters of the modification.<br>
In a further embodiment, the sample contains one or more photo-switchable labels, so that<br>
the activating light beam is able to activate, quench or switch the label as described above<br>
in order to observe the labelled component over short (fast moving components), medium,<br>
or long time scales (rare events or configurations).<br>
The labels may comprise a naturally occurring fluorescent molecule such as NADH, a<br>
calcium probe such as "Fura", and/or an antibody tagged with a fluorescent molecule and<br>
bound to a selected species.<br>
The labels may comprise a pair of fluorescent molecules with overlapping emission-<br>
excitation spectra of the types used in fluorescence resonant energy transfer ("FRET"), and<br>
the activating light beam may be set to photo-bleach the acceptor molecule in a region of<br>
the sample, so that the FRET process may be confirmed in that region.<br>
One of the FRET pair may be a photo-switching label, and the activating light beam may<br>
be set to switch the photo-switching label in a region of the sample, so that the FRETing<br>
process may be confirmed in that region.<br>
The labels may comprise a caged compound that releases an active group when illuminated<br>
by the activating light beam [ref. J.C. Politz, see above.].<br><br>
In a further embodiment, the excitation light source 11 may emit one or more spectral<br>
bands from a broadband light source such as a lamp. Furthermore, the excitation light<br>
source may be controllable to provide excitation light at more than one distinct waveband<br>
in order to distinguish between different labels. In some processes, it may be<br>
advantageous for the excitation light source to be pulsed.<br>
The excitation light source may be of the type employed in fluorescent speckle microscopy<br>
[ref. M.C. Adams et al, Methods, 2002, Vol. 29, pp. 29-41.]).<br>
In a further embodiment, the activating light beam may be derived from the same source as<br>
the excitation light.<br>
The activating light beam may be:<br>
pulsed;<br>
an optical trap or optical tweezer arrangement;<br>
a laser dissection mechanism for removing a region of interest from the sample for<br>
subsequent handling; or<br>
a laser ablation mechanism for removing a region of interest from the sample for<br>
subsequent handling.<br>
A localised energy beam may be employed to form an opening in a structure, such as a<br>
cell, in response to detected radiation emanating from a sample. Preferably, a laser is<br>
used. This may be a Tirsapphire, argon-ion or frequency-shifted Nd:YAG laser for<br>
example. Alternatively, a diode laser can be employed which may be less costly.<br>
Exposing a cell to 0.3mW of violet light from a diode laser for 40ms has been found to<br>
perforate a cell membrane. The beam was focussed onto the cell using'a xlOO microscope<br>
objective lens to form a spot about 1 micron in diameter. This results in a power density<br>
of around 1200MW/m2. The cell membrane was able to "heal" itself shortly after the<br>
process without apparently suffering any long term damage or mutation [ref. Optics<br>
Express, Vol.13, page 595].<br><br>
The same light source may be used to generate the localised energy beam to form an<br>
opening in a structure as is used to generate the activating light beam, and for the<br>
excitation light beam.<br>
In a further embodiment, the system may have one or more photo-detectors such as photo-<br>
multiplier tubes and a scanning arrangement of the excitation light beam and/or me<br>
emission light path to the detector and/or the detector to observe parts or all the sample.<br>
The system may have more than one imaging detector fitted with different light filtering<br>
components to distinguish between different labels.<br>
The detector may be fitted with a gating device, and the excitation light source may be<br>
pulsed, so that the time taken for the fluorescent label to emit light following the pulse may<br>
be used to distinguish between different labels.<br>
The controller may be implemented in hardware and/or software.<br>
In a further embodiment, the system may use a confocal principle, collecting light at a<br>
single image plane by the use of one or more pinholes and a scanning mechanism.<br>
Alternatively, a structured iUumination technique may be utilised to section a sample<br>
optically at different depths [ref. M.A.A. Neil, R. Juskaitis and T. Wilson, Optical<br>
Letters, 22(24): 1905-1907, Dec. 15 1997]. This may be more cost effective than a laser<br>
scanning confocal system, as it can be carried out using a conventional light microscope.<br>
A total internal reflection (TIRF) principle may be employed in which the excitation light<br>
source is directed to be internally reflected at the sample-sample carrier surface, thus<br>
exciting only-parts of the sample close to the surface [ref. Y. Sako and T. Yanagida,<br>
Nature Supp Imaging in Cell Biol, Sept 2003, SS1-SS5..].<br>
Furthermore, the system may use a deconvolution principle, capturing a group of images<br>
focused at different imaging planes, and applying a deconvolution process to allow<br><br>
volumetric (XYZ) data to be acquired. Volumetric time series (XYZT) data, volumetric<br>
multi-wavelength (XYWZ) data, or volumetric multi-wavelength time series (XYWZT)<br>
data may be acquired.<br>
A multi-photon microscope employing a long wavelength (800-1200nm) high speed pulsed<br>
laser may form the excitation light source and/or as the activating light beam [ref. J.<br>
Pawley, Handbook of Confocal Microscopy].<br>
The light or fluorescence microscope may be replaced with a simplified arrangement of<br>
sample holder, magnifying objective lens and dichroic mirror to direct light from the<br>
irradiation light source and the activating light beam to the sample, and collect the emitted<br>
light beam and to direct it to a detector.<br>
Alternatively, the fluorescence microscope may be replaced by an endoscope.<br>
The sample may be a homogenous population of cells such as a cell culture. Alternatively,<br>
the sample may be a heterogenous multi-cellular assembly such as a cell culture; a multi-<br>
cellular assembly such as a tissue culture; a stem cell sample; a tissue sample; an organ,<br>
such as an eye or retina, or the inside of the gut or a blood vessel; a whole animal, such as<br>
the worm C.elegans, an insect, fish, mammal or amphibian; a whole or part of a plant or<br>
fungus, a dividing cell or an embryo; one of more samples held in a multi-site carrier such<br>
as a slide, or a multi-well plate, which is scanned sequentially; or a material sample<br>
undergoing some change such as diffusion of one or more species.<br><br>

ABSTRACT<br><br><br>
A METHOD OF ANALYSING A SAMPLE AND APPARATUS THEREFOR<br>
Fluorescent labels are used as labels to investigate processes in biological<br>
samples without affecting their normal functioning. A method of analysing a<br>
sample (48) using fluorescent labels and apparatus including processing means<br>
(18) comprises the steps of:<br>
(a)	irradiating (12) the sample (48) with<br>
excitation energy;<br>
(b)	detecting (16) fluorescent radiation emitted by labels in the sample (48)<br>
when excited by the excitation energy; and<br>
(c)	modifying the environmental conditions (42) of the sample with the<br>
apparatus in response to user input after the beginning of step (a) and/or in<br>
response to analysis by the processing means (18) of the results of the<br>
fluorescent radiation detection step (b).<br>
Thus modifications may be determined and executed interactively as an<br>
experiment progresses, and therefore directed towards specific structures and/or<br>
events identified as of particular interest in the course of the experiment.</td>
