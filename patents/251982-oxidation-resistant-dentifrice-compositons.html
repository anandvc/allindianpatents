				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>[0001J The invention relates to dentifrices compositions containing antioxidant active ingredients. In particular, the invention relates to non-aqueous dentifrices showing oxidation stability.<br>
[0002]       Formulated dentifrices such as tooth pastes and gels contain a number of functional and active ingredients, each of which contribute to one or a number of desirable properties. Properly formulated dentifrices are suitable for regular use to promote oral health. Functional additives include abrasive materials that remove stains and other materials from tooth surfaces, foaming agents that disperse other ingredients and provide for delivery of the active and functional materials to the oral surfaces, and tartar control agents to prevent the formation of calculus on tooth surfaces, as well as aesthetic functional ingredients such as flavors and pigments. Active ingredients include anticaries agents that provide a source of fluoride ion upon use. Various compositions also contain compounds or components with antibacterial properties, for example to reduce the formation of plaque on the surfaces. Further active ingredients include those with anti-inflammatory properties for prophylaxis and treatment of conditions such as gingivitis.<br>
[0003]       Antioxidants have been proposed as ingredients of oral care compositions such as dentifrices. The antioxidants may act as a stabilizing agent by protecting a readily oxidizable ingredient from degradation. In addition, components with antioxidant activity can also act as agents to enhance oral and/or whole body health.<br>
[0004]       Ideally, dentifrice compositions should be stable during manufacture, shipping, and use by the consumer. An important function of antioxidant components of <br>
dentifrice compositions is to prevent deterioration of the dentifrice. In various aspects, such deterioration could manifest itself as a loss of efficacy in various active ingredients or a loss in the esthetic properties of the dentifrice, such as taste and appearance.<br>
[0005]      In one mode of operation, antioxidant components act by themselves being sacrificially oxidized in order that other components of the composition can be protected. Unsightly oxidation products of the antioxidant additives in a dentifrice composition can lead to undesirable coloring or browning of the compositions. Such discoloration can be noticeable especially in compositions that are lightly colored or are pigmented to be white.<br>
[0006]      It is thus always desirable to provide toothpaste and other dentifrice compositions with a wide variety of active and functional materials. It is further desirable to provide antioxidant properties to the dentifrice composition, without leading to undesirable side affects such as discoloration.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0007]      According to one aspect of the invention, dentifrice compositions are provided that contain various plant components such as flavonoids, catechins, and polyphenols. Sources of the plant components include a variety of plant extracts such as rosemary extract and green tea extract. Toothpastes and other dentifrices are provided that contain the components yet are resistant to discoloration from oxidation.<br>
[0008]      Thus, in one aspect the invention provides low water tooth pastes containing a variety of plant extracts. Alternatively, the invention provides dentifrice compositions containing humectants, abrasive compounds, and a variety of plant extracts, such as rosemary and green tea extracts, along with an additional antioxidant component.<br><br>
Examples of antioxidants include stannous compounds, sodium metabisulfite, BHT, ammonium sulfate, and potassium stannate. The invention also provides methods for promoting oral health of a subject animal comprising applying a composition as discussed above to the oral surfaces of the animal.<br>

|0019]      The term "inhibiting" herein with respect to a condition such as inflammation in an oral tissue encompasses prevention, suppression, reduction in extent or severity, or amelioration of the condition.<br>
(0020]      In one embodiment, the invention provides an oral or dentifrice composition, such as a tooth paste or gel, containing at least one humectant, at least one abrasive compound, at least one plant-derivable compound, and less than 10% by weight water, preferably less than 8% by weight, and more preferably less than 6% by weight water. In various embodiments, the plant-derivable compounds are selected from the group consisting of flavonoids, catechins, polyphenols, and tannins. In various aspects, the plant-derivable compounds are components of plant extracts, wherein the extracts are preferably present in the oral composition at a level of about 0.001% to about 5% by weight, preferably about 0.01% to 1% by weight. In certain embodiments, the oral compositions further comprise an antioxidant material, non-limiting examples of which include stannous compounds, stannates, ammonium sulfate, BHT, and sodium meta-bisulfite. The tooth pastes or dentifrices can be formulated with additional active and functional materials such as anticalculus systems, antibacterial compositions, anticaries agents, and the like.<br><br>
[0021       In another embodiment, the invention provides a tooth paste or gel composition containing 1% to 70% by weight of at least one humectant, 1% to 70% by weight of at least one abrasive compound, less than 10% by weight water, and 0.001% to 5% by weight, preferably 0.01 to 1 % by weight, of a plant extract that contains one or more organic components selected from the group consisting of flavonoids, catechins, polyphenols, and tannins. In various preferred embodiments, the oral composition contains less than 6% by weight water. As before, the compositions are optionally formulated with other functional and active materials such as, without limitation, anticalculus, anticaries, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory agents.<br>
[0022]      In a further embodiment, the invention provides methods for promoting oral health of a subject animal comprising applying any of the toothpaste or dentifrice compositions described above to the oral surfaces of the animal. The invention contemplates methods for veterinary as well as human use.<br>
[0023]       In one aspect, the methods of the invention are based in part of the discovery that discoloration of dentifrice compositions including flavonoid, cataechin, polyphenol, or tannin compounds can be reduced or mitigated by formulating the composition to contain less than 10% by weight water, by adding certain antioxidant materials to the formulation, or both. Thus, in one embodiment, the invention provides methods for reducing the extent of discoloration in a toothpaste where the toothpaste contains plant extracts or other components that comprise one or more of the compounds noted above. The flavonoid, catechin, polyphenol, and/or tannin compounds tends to oxidize and discolor the toothpaste composition over time. The methods comprise at least one of formulating the toothpaste to contain less than 10% by weight water and adding to the toothpaste an amount<br><br>
effective to reduce discoloration of an antioxidant selected from group exemplified by stannous compounds; stannate compounds; ammonium sulfate; phenol antioxidants such as BHT; hydroquinones such as BHA; and metabisulfite salts such as sodium metabisulfite and potassium metabisulfite. In various embodiments, the compositions used in the method contain less than 8% by weight water or less than 6% by weight water. The flavonoid and other components of the dentifrice compositions are generally derived from a variety of plant extracts, such as without limitation rosemary extract and green tea extract. The compositions used in the methods are optionally formulated to contain other functional and active materials such as anticalculus agents, antibacterial agents, anticaries ingredients, and the like.<br>
[0024|      A number of plant extracts can be used in the dentifrice composition to provide a source of flavonoid, catechin, polyphenol, and tannin components. Generally, the plant extracts contain a number of oxidizable species that tend to produce color over time when formulated into a composition such as a tooth paste or gel.  These are called plant-derivable compounds because they occur naturally in plants and can be isolated from them. Non-limiting examples of plants from which extracts can be provided include Rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary), Camellia sinensis (green tea), Origanum vulgare (oregano), Scutellaria baicalensis (baikal skullcap), Vitis vinifera (grape seed and grape skin), and other Scutellaria species such as S. orthocalyx and 5. lateriflora. Such plant extracts are generally prepared by extraction of leaves or other components of the plants by known methods. Non-limiting examples include extraction with a variety of solvents such as water, alcohols (especially ethanol), supercritical fluids such as carbon dioxide, and chlorofluorocarbons. Solvent soluble components are thus extracted from various plant materials by various<br><br>
known methods. Many plant extracts are commercially available. Suppliers include Sabinsa Corporation and Indena S.p.A., and Guangzhou-Honsea Sunshine BST.<br>
[002S]       In various embodiments, oral compositions contains from about 0.001 to about 5.0 weight percent of plant extract or of plant-derivable compounds. In various embodiments, compounds such as flavonoids, catechins, polyphenols, and tannins are added directly to oral compositions of the invention. Suitable levels are from about 0.001 to about 5 percent by weight of the oral composition, for example from 0.01 to 5%, 0.01 to 1%, 0.05 to 2%, 0.05 to 2%, 0.1 to 1%, 0.1 to 0.5%, and 0.1 to 0.3%.  The compounds make up less than 100% of the extract, so relatively higher levels of added extract are needed to achieve a certain level of the compounds. However, in various embodiments, the compositions contain plant extracts at the levels listed above.<br>
[0026]      Optional antioxidants for use in dentifrice compositions of the invention include stannous compounds. Stannous compounds include organic and inorganic sources capable of releasing stannous ion. Non-limiting inorganic sources include stannous chloride, fluoride, sulfate, phosphate, metaphosphate, and pyrophosphate.  Organic source include, without limitation, stannous acetate, tartrate, citrate, malate, malonate, gluconate, and oxalate. Further non-limiting examples of antioxidants include stannate materials such as potassium stannate; ammonium sulfate; phenolic antioxidants such as BHT; hydrioquinone antioxidants such as BHA; and sulfur containing antioxidants such as sodium or potassium metabisulfite.<br>
[0027]       Other non-limiting examples of antioxidants are found for example in the chapter on Antioxidants of the Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 4th<br><br>
edition, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference. Preferred antioxidants for use in oral compositions are those that are compatible with other components of the composition and are not hazardous to health. For example, it is preferred to use antioxidants that are generally regarded as safe, and particular individual components that are on the GRAS list of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Preferred antioxidants include ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid, ascorbyl palmitate, thiodipropionic acid, calcium ascorbate, dilauryldithiopropionate, gum guaiac, sodium ascorbate, BHT, BHA, and tocopherols. Mixtures and combinations of antioxidants can be used. If present, the antioxidant is added in a level effective to reduce or mitigate discoloration that would otherwise result from oxidation of the flavonoid components of the toothpaste. Without limitation, treatment levels range from about 0.01% to about 1% of the antioxidant, based on the total weight of the dentifrice composition. For the stannous and stannate antioxidant, preferred ranges include from about 0.05% to about 0.5%, preferably from about 0.1% to about 0.5%.<br>
[0028]      In various embodiments, the dentifrice compositions contain relatively low amounts of water. In many aspects, the dentifrice compositions contain less water than typical of current commercial formulations. In one embodiment, the compositions contain less than 10% by weight water, for example less than 8% by weight and less than 6% by weight water. The total amount of water in the dentifrice compositions includes contributions from water intentionally added as a component and water present as a byproduct or solvent for various other components. In various embodiments, the dentifrice compositions are formulated without adding water as a separate component. The resulting water content of the dentifrice composition is then derived from the residual water present as solvent or byproduct in the various components. As discussed above, a formulated dentifrice<br><br>
generally contains 10% or less by water, preferably less than 8% and more preferably less than 6%.<br>
[0029] Flavonoids are members of a large category of plant products that derive from y-pyrone. In one aspect, the compounds are derived either from 2-phenylbenzopyrone (1) or 3-phenylbenzopyrone (2)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Individual flavanoids can be classified into various groups, which differ among themselve; by the oxidation level and/or the substitution pattern on the heterocyclic ring (ring C) Among the groups are chalcones, flavanones, isoflavanones, flavones, anthocyanidin (flavylium cations), flavan-3-ols (catechins), flavan-3,4-diols (proanthocyanidins) biflavonoids and oligomeric flavonoids, isoflavonoids, aurones, and free beta ring flavonoids Many of these groups are illustrated here.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 [0030]      There are many hundreds or thousands of flavonoid compounds that have been isolated and identified from plants. Flavonoids are components of plant extracts, since they are soluble in the solvents used to prepare the extracts.  The basic classes of flavonoids differ according to the oxidation state of ring B and the site of attachment of ring C, as indicated above. Within a class, individual flavonoids differ by the number and position of substituent groups on positions 1 - 8 and 1' - 6'. The most common constituents include hydroxy, methoxy, and sugars. Among the flavones and flavonones, positions 3', 4', 5, and 7 are the most commonly substituted, while for the flavonols, anthocyanidins, and flavan-3-ols, position 3 is often additionally substituted. The number of substituents varies widely, and can range from zero to eight, with four to six being most common.<br>
[0031]       Flavonoids occur frequently in plants as glycosides, with hexoses such as glucose, galactose, and rhamnose and pentoses such as arabinose and xylose being the most common. For flavanones and flavones the 7-hydroxyl is most commonly glycosylated; for flavonols it the 3- and 7-hydroxyls, while for the anthocyanins it is the 3- and 5-hydroxyls. The sugars attached to the flavonoids in this way are often themselves esterified, for example with p-coumaric, eaffeic, ferulic, and sinapic acid.<br>
[0032]      Another class of flavonoids is the free B-ring flavones and flavanols, which have no substituent groups on the B-ring. Free B-ring flavonoids have been reported to have diverse biological activity. Sources include the roots of Scutellaria species such as S. baicalensis, S. lateriflora, and S. orthocalyx,<br>
[0033]       Depending on the basic skeleton, flavonoids can be detected by their absorption in the visible between about 330 and 370 nanometers.  Aromatic esters such as<br>
coumaric, caffeic, ferulic, and sinapic are usually marked by an additional band between about 307 and 340 nanometers.<br>
(0034]       In various embodiments, flavonoid compounds as described above represent minor components of the plant extracts. For example, rosemary extract contains major amounts of carnosic, ursolic, and oleanolic acid and lesser amounts of flavonoids, while the extract of Scutellaria baicalensis contains baicilin. As a result, even though many flavonoids are colored as shown by their absorption in the visible region, their treat levels in preferred embodiments are sufficiently low that pigmenting is not unacceptably interfered with. For example, white dentifrices and tooth pastes can be formulated by adding white pigments such as titanium dioxide that tend to mask any slight amount of color in the flavonoids present at low levels. Alternatively, compositions can be pigmented with colored pigments that are compatible with or even augment any natural color given by the flavonoids.<br>
[0035]      Polyphenols are a class of plant-derivable compounds characterized by the presence in the molecular structure of two or more phenyl rings that contain a hydroxy substituent.  Depending on the substitution pattern of the flavonoids shown above, many of the flavonoids are also polyphenols.<br>
[0036)      Tannins are a broad but well defined category of plant-derivable compounds. Tannins are polyphenolic secondary metabolites of higher plants. Representative of one class of tannins are the galloyl esters and their derivatives, where galloyl moieties are attached to a variety of polyol, catechin, and triterpenoid cores (gallotannins, ellagitannins, and complex tannins, respectively). Another class includes complex tannins that are oligomeric and polymeric proanthocyanadins; these can have<br>
various interflavanyl coupling and substitution patterns. Tannins are described in Natural Products Reports, vol. 18, p. 641-649 (Royal Society of Chemistry, 2001), the entire description of which is incorporated by reference.<br>
[0037]       The compounds are plant-derivable in that they can be isolated from the leaves and other parts of higher plants such as those described above. In various preferred embodiments, the compounds are added in the form of plant extracts. These are complex mixtures of solvent soluble components which, as described above, are isolated by solvent extraction of parts of the plants.<br>
[0038]      In dentifrice compositions with a relatively high amount of water, and in various embodiments where the compositions lack suitable levels of antioxidants, oxidation of the plant-derivable compounds over time can lead to an undesirable darkening or browning even of pigmented dentifrices, which would be a disadvantage or drawback in the eyes of many consumers. In various embodiments, compositions of the invention overcome such a drawback.<br>
100.39J      In addition to the plant derivable compounds and the optional antioxidant components, the oral or dentifrice compositions of the invention contain orally acceptable amounts of a number of other active and non-active materials that are commonly found in tooth pastes and the like. In various embodiments, advantages are provided by certain combinations of these otherwise conventional components with each other and with the plant extracts and plant-derivable compounds described here.<br>
[0040]       In various embodiments, dentifrice compositions contain at least one humectant, useful for example to prevent hardening of a toothpaste upon exposure to air.<br>
Any orally acceptable humectant can be used, including without limitation polyhydric alcohols such as glycerin, propylene glycol, sorbitol, xylitol and low molecular weight polyethylene glycol (PEG). Most humectants also function as sweeteners. One or more humectants are optionally present in a total amount of about 1% to about 70%, for example about 1% to about 50%, about 2% to about 25%, or about 5% to about 15% by weight of the composition.<br>
[0041 ]       In one embodiment a composition of the invention comprises at least one abrasive, useful for example as a polishing agent. Any orally acceptable abrasive can be used, but type, fineness (particle size) and amount of abrasive should be selected so that tooth enamel is not excessively abraded in normal use of the composition. Suitable abrasives include without limitation silica, for example in the form of silica gel, hydrated silica or precipitated silica, alumina, insoluble phosphates, calcium carbonate, resinous abrasives such as urea-formaldehyde condensation products and the like. Among insoluble phosphates useful as abrasives are orthophosphates, polymetaphosphates and pyrophosphates. Illustrative examples are dicalcium orthophosphate dihydrate, calcium pyrophosphate, β-calcium pyrophosphate, tricalcium phosphate, calcium polymetaphosphate and insoluble sodium polymetaphosphate. One or more abrasives are optionally present in an abrasive effective total amount, typically about 5% to about 70%, for example about 10% to about 50% or about 15% to about 30% by weight of the composition. Average particle size of an abrasive, if present, is generally about 0.1 to about 30 μm, for example about 1 to about 20 μm or about 5 to about 15μm<br>
[0042]       In another embodiment the compositions comprise an orally acceptable anticalculus agent. One or more such agents can be present. Suitable anticalculus agents<br>
include without limitation phosphates and polyphosphates (for example pyrophosphates), polyarninopropanesulfonic acid (AMPS), zinc citrate trihydrate, polypeptides such as polyaspartic and polyglutamic acids, polyolefin sulfonates, polyolefin phosphates, diphosphonates such as azacycloalkane-2,2-diphosphonates (e.g., azacycloheptane-2,2-diphosphonic acid), N-methyl azacyclopentane-2,3-diphosphonic acid, ethane-1-hydroxy-1,1-diphosphonic acid (EHDP) and ethane-l-amino-l,l-diphosphonate, phosphonoalkane carboxylic acids and salts of any of these agents, for example their alkali metal and ammonium salts. Useful inorganic phosphate and polyphosphate salts illustratively include monobasic, dibasic and tribasic sodium phosphates, sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP), tetrapolyphosphate, mono-, di-, trisodium pyrophosphates, tetrasodium pyrophosphates(TSPP), disodium dihydrogen pyrophosphate, sodium trimetaphosphate, sodium hexametaphosphate and the like, wherein sodium can optionally be replaced by potassium or ammonium. Other useful anticalculus agents include polycarboxylate polymers. These include polymers and copolymers of carboxylic monomers such as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, and maleic anhydride. Non-limiting examples include polyvinyl methyl ether/maleic anhydride (PVME/MA) copolymers, such as those available under the Gantrez™ brand from ISP, Wayne, NJ. In various embodiments, the anticalculus agent is made of phosphate compounds such as STPP and TSPP, and polycarboxylate polymer such as the Gantrez® types as an anionic carboxylate component. Still other useful anticalculus agents include sequestering agents including hydroxycarboxylic acids such as citric, fumaric, malic, glutaric and oxalic acids and salts thereof, and aminopolycarboxylic acids such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). One or more anticalculus agents are optionally<br><br>
