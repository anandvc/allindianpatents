Stabilized medium and high voltage cable insulation composition<br>
The invention relates to a polyethylene composition for use as insulation for wire and cable that has improved scorch resistance, the stabilized composition is suitable for use as cable insulation of medium and high voltage power cables.<br>
Insulation compositions generally include a polyethylene, a peroxide crosslinking agent and a stabilizer. Polymers containing peroxides are vulnerable to scorch, i.e. to premature crosslinking occurring during the extrusion process.<br>
There are several key factors which must be considered when making the choice of an appropriate stabilizing system. These factors include the crosslinking speed and the degree of crosslinking, resistance to scorch at extrusion temperatures, efficient retention of mechanical properties before and after high temperature aging, no exudation to the polymer surface and a high degree of cleanliness.<br>
US Patent 6,191,230 described a polyethylene composition containing as scorch inhibitor a substituted hydroquinone, 4,4'-thiobis(2-methyl-6 -tert.-butylphenol); 4,4'-thiobis(2 -tert.-butyl-5-methylphenol); or mixtures thereof.<br>
In order to remove electroconductive impurities the European Patent Application EP-A-613154 describes a process to prepare a polyethylene composition whereby the crosslinking agent and/or the stabilizer are blended into a low density polyethylene after being subjected to a purification process.<br>
Cleanliness is a critical parameter and there is still a need to provide clean insulating material containing polyethylene crosslinkable compositions which can be extruded with a minimum of premature crosslinking and yet showing a sufficient crosslinking speed.<br>
It has now been found that an improved insulation material can be obtained by using a liquid stabilizing system.<br><br>
Thus, the invention relates to a composition comprising<br>
(a)	a polyethylene<br>
(b)	a scorch inhibitor having a melting point below 50 °C at atmospheric pressure, and<br>
(c)	an organic peroxide.<br>
Scorch inhibitors having a melting point below 50 °C at atmospheric pressure are e.g.<br>

The compounds of the formulae I, II and III are prepared by processes which are known per se and described in US 4,759, 862 and US 4,857,572 (formula I) or in US 5,008,459 (formula II and III).<br>
Polyethylene, as that term is used herein, is a homopolymer of ethylene or a copolymer of ethylene and a minor proportion of one or more alpha-olefins having 3 to 12 carbon atoms, and preferably 4 to 8 carbon atoms, and, optionally, a diene, or a mixture or blend of such homopolymers and copolymers. The mixture can be a mechanical blend or an in situ blend. Examples of the alpha-olefins are propylene, 1-butene, 1-hexene, 4-methyM-pentene, and 1-octene. The polyethylene can also be a copolymer of ethylene and an unsaturated ester such as a vinyl ester, e.g., vinyl acetate or an acrylic or methacrylic acid ester<br>
Suitable polyethylenes are so-called high pressure polyethylenes. A variety of such polymers are commercially available. The high pressure polyethylenes are preferably homopolymers of ethylene having a density in the range of 0.910 to 0.930g/cm'. The homopolymer can also have a melt index in the range of about 1 to about 5 g per 10 minutes, and preferably has a<br><br>
melt index in the range of about 0.75 to about 3 g per 10 minutes. Melt index is determined under ASTMD-1238.<br>
The crosslinking agent is an organic peroxide including dialkyl peroxides such as dicumyl peroxide, di -tert.-butyl peroxide, tert.-butyl cumyl peroxide, 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-di(t-butyl-peroxy)-hexane, 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-di(t-amylperoxy)-hexane, 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-di(t-butylperoxy) hexane-3, 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-di(t*amylperoxy)hexyne-3, <x di peroxide and mixtures thereof. other suitable organic peroxides are: succinic acid benzoyl tert.-butyl peroxy-2-ethyl hexanoate p-chlorobenzoyl peroxy isobutylate isopropyl carbonate laurate acetate diperoxy phthalate maleic cyclohexanone benzoate. preferred are dialkylperoxides.></x>
The organic peroxides have a decomposition temperature in the range of 100 to 200°C. Especially preferred is dicumyl peroxide, having a decomposition temperature of 150°C.<br>
The organic peroxide and the scorch inhibitor are incorporated into the polyethylene by known methods, for example by melt blending in a roll mill, a kneading extruder or a mixer at a temperature lower than the decomposition temperature of the peroxide or by a soaking method whereby the liquid scorch inhibitor/peroxide blend is mixed until the whole liquid phase is soaked into the polymer.<br>
The scorch inhibitor and/or the peroxide can be added to the polyethylene either before or during processing.<br>
The amount of the scorch inhibitor is in the range from 0.01 to 1wt%, preferably 0.1 to 0.5wt%,<br>
The amount of the peroxide is in the range from 0.5 to 5 wt% preferably 1 to 3wt%.<br>
Optionally epoxidized soya bean oil can be added in an amount 1 to 3wt%, preferably 2wt% to the polymer to stabilize the polymer against color degradation.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment the process is carried out in an extruder. The polyethylene or the polyethylene/peroxide blend is introduced into the extruder and the scorch inhibitor having a melting point below 50 °C or the scorch inhibitor and the peroxide is added, for example, through a side feed to said extruder, optionally after being filtered.<br>
The extrudate is then crosslinked by exposing it to a temperature greater than the decomposition temperature of which the organic peroxide decomposes. The extrusion can be done around one or more electrical conductors to form a medium voltage or high voltage cable. The conductor is either a bare conductor or the conductor is surrounded by primary insulation and /or semicon layer. The cable is then exposed to crosslinking temperatures.<br>
The crosslinking may be carried out in any conventional fashion such as in an oven or in a continuous vulcanization tube, optionally, but not necessarily under nitrogen atmosphere and increased pressure.<br>
The stabilized composition is suitable for use as cable insulation of medium and high voltage power cables. A range for medium voltage is 1 kV to 40 kV. "High voltage" relates to a valve voltage exceeding about 40 kV, especially 40-110kV.<br>
Advantages of the inventionjs a surprisingly high resistance to scorch at extrusion temperature^hile_majntaining a satisfactory_crosslinking speed and crosslinking density The mechanical properties before and after heat aging meet the industrial standard requirements.<br>
The following examples illustrate the invention in detail.<br>
Compound preparation<br>
A low density polyethylene (d=0.923g/cm3), type Escorene LD 100 MED from Exxon Mobil Chemical, is heated up to 90°C in a static oven. The stabilizer and the peroxide are heated up to 70°C by exposure to a water bath. The clear stabilizer/peroxide melt is added to the warm polymer granulate and kept in the oven for approximately 60min. Every ten minutes<br><br>
the mixture is quickly removed and thoroughly shaken. The procedure is repeated until the whole liquid phase was soaked into the polymer.<br>
Examples of laboratory results:<br>
Scorch resistance<br>
In order to simulate cable extrusion condition's, 43 g of each compound are weighed and stir melted at 30 rpm in a lab kneader, type Brabender Plasticorder 814 300, at an initial mass temperature of 120°C. The material is kneaded under a constant load of 2.0 kg until the minimum torque is obtained and a subsequent remarkable increase in torque could be observed. The scorch time is determined as the period between minimum torque and an increase by 1Nm starting from the minimum torque. A longer scorch time means fewer problems occur due to premature crosslinking during extrusion. Tab. 1 shows the results.<br>
Crosslinking procedure<br>
The production of crosslinked PE-LD plaques (thickness: 1.5 mm) is carried out in three compression molders atdifferent temperatures: In the first mold a defined weight of material is spread out in a frame and heated up to 120"C for six minutes. During that time the pressure is increased stepwise from 0 to 150 bar. In the next step the frame with the plaques is transferred to a second compression molder and left at 180°C for 15 min for completion of crosslinking. Finally, the plaques are cooled down from 180°C to room temperature within ten minutes.<br>
Crosslinking Speed In the Rheometer<br>
5g of each sample are heated up to 180°C in a Moving Die Rheometer (Monsanto MDR<br>
2000). At test temperature the samples are exposed to a periodical alternating stress at<br>
constant amplitude (3° torsion at 1.66 Hz) until the maximum torque is obtained. The<br>
criterion is the constant crossliijiking speed, which is a measure of the interaction between<br>
i crosslinking agent and antioxidant.<br><br><br>
Gel Content<br>
The amount of insolubles is generally a measure of the degree of crosslinking obtained A defined weight of the crosslinked plaques is exposed to a solvent (toluene, xylene or decaline) at 90°C for 24h. The soluble parts are filtered through a sieve and both sieve and sample are washed with the corresponding solvent. Afterwards both are dried in a vacujm dryer until a constant weight is obtained.<br>
The Gel content was determined according to the formula: Get content (%) = 100 (W, - W 2)/W3 W,    «      Weight of Sieve and insolubles after vacuum drying WH    =      Weight of the annealed, empty sieve before filtration W2    =      Weight of the polymer sample<br>
All results (Table 2) are in the typical range expected for this kind of application.<br><br><br>
Thermal Aging and Mechanical Tests<br>
Tensile bars (dimensions according to DIN 53-504-82) are punched from the crosslinked<br>
plaques and split into four sets for oven aging at 150°C for 0, 3, 10 and 14 days. The tensile<br>
bars are evaluated for retention of tensile strength and elongation (yield; break).<br>
All results (Tables 3 and 4) are within the standard range of results expected for this<br>
application.<br><br><br><br>
Reduced Exudation of Stabilizers<br>
It is examined how the liquid systems behave in comparison to the solid ones. A high<br>
tendency for migration of stabilizers to the polymer surface can cause various problems,<br>
such as loss of active radical scavengers and a sticky surface lumping together the granules<br>
during storage. Exudation of stabilizers and peroxides is also known to have a negative<br>
impact on the extrusion process and the cable product and exudation dust may foul filters<br>
and cause slippage and instability in the extrusion process.<br>
The example compares the sweat out or exudation behavior of the different systems after conditioning at 55°C. Both Invention A and Invention B show an impressive improvement in terms of compatibility with the polymer. This offers a further opportunity for the converter to<br><br>
increase the additive loadings if appropriate, especially where higher scorch resistance is desired, without expecting severe problems with exudation..<br>
Each formulation is kept in the oven at 55°C in order to simulate antioxidant plate out. At the appropriate recall interval, an aliquot is extracted from the oven and measured for surface exudation. The samples are washed with methylene chloride (about 15 seconds contact with polymer) and the solution is then transferred to a round bottom flask and evaporated to dryness. The resultant residue is reconstituted with a standard solution and analyzed quantitatively via liquid chromatography.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
