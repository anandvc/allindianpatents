				<td>DescriptionTechnical  Field<br>
The  present  invention  relates  to  a  method  of  pleating and  folding  a  tubular  blank  of  filter  paper,   elongated  in appearance  and  containing  measured  and  separate  quantities  of a  substance  with  which  to  prepare  an  infusion,   in  such  a  way as  to  obtain  a  filter  bag  exhibiting  two  distinct  envelopes. The  method  in  question  comprises  the  steps  of:<br>
-	conveying  tubular  blanks  of  filter  paper  singly  and  in succession  along  a  feed  direction  extending  substantially tangential  to  a  rotatable  wheel  equipped  with  radial  grippers affording  relative  arms  by  which  each  filter  bag  is  taken  up, compacted  and  conveyed  further;<br>
-	taking  up  a  tubular  blank  of  filter  paper  in  a  position above  at  least  three  bearing  elements  ordered  along  the  feed direction,   of  which  two  are  stationary,   shaped  in  such  a  way as  to  converge  toward  the  wheel  and  offered  to  opposite  ends of  the  tubular  blank,  whilst  the  third  is  capable  of  movement transversely  to  the  feed  direction;<br>
-	forming  a  pleat  in  an  intermediate  portion  of  the  tubular blank;<br>
-	folding  the  tubular  blank  double  in  such  a  way  as   to  draw<br>
the  relative  envelopes  together,   by  inducing  a  movement  that<br>
commences  in  the  position  at  which  the  tubular  blank  is  taken<br>
up  above  the  bearing  elements  and  terminates  at  a  position  in<br>
which  the  tubular  blank,   guided  by  the  stationary  bearing elements,   comes  to  rest  between  the  arms  of  the  gripper  with the  two  ends  close  together.<br>
The  method  relates  in  particular  to  a  twin  envelope  type of  filter  bag  in  which  the  pockets  containing  the  substance terminate  in  closures  created  with  folds  made  in  the  paper mechanically.<br>
Bags  of  the  type  in  question  are  utilized  widely  in  the packaging  of  substances  intended  for  infusion,   in  particular tea,'herbal  powders  etc.,   for  the  reason  that  the  division  of the  measure  into  two  half-measures  results  in  an  easier  and â€¢ swifter  contact  with  water  and  therefore  a  better  preparation of  the  beverage.   The  bag  is  fashioned  from  a  tubular  blank  of filter  paper,   cut  initially  from  a  continuous  strip  that  has been  folded  and  secured  longitudinally  to  produce  the  tubular section:   a  pleat  of  familiar  "W"  profile  is   formed  across  the middle  part  of  the  blank,   serving  to  separate  the  two  pockets or  envelopes,   whereupon  the  two  envelopes  are  rotated  about the  pleat  and  brought  together  side  by  side  to  establish  the final  shape  of  the  bag.<br>
Background  Art<br>
In  a  first  method  of  the  type  in  question,   implemented using  a  manufacturing  machine  of  broadly  conventional  design (see  DE  1  001  944),   the  tubular  blanks  are  directed  onto  a wheel  equipped  with  grippers,   which  is  rotatable  and  capable thus  of  movement  intermittently  through  a  succession  of  work stations.   The  pleat  is   formed  by  interaction  with  the  wheel at  one  of  these  stations,   whereupon  the  two  envelopes  are folded  double  and  brought  together  by  relative  arms  emerging from  the  wheel.<br>
Having  thus  received  its  essential  shape,   the  filter  bag undergoes  further  operations,   chief  among  which  being  the formation  of  a  closure  effected  by  folding  the  ends  of  the tubular  blank  in  suitable  manner.<br>
By  reason  of  the  fact  that  the  manufacturing  operations mentioned  above  are  brought  about  on  a  structure  moving  at high  speed,   and  intermittently moreover,   the  contents  of  the bag  are  subjected  to  a  certain  agitation  that  can  cause  the substance  in  the  envelopes  to  shift  and  collect  in  localized areas;   the  dimensions  of  the  bag  thus  become  enlarged  at  the points  which  favour  the  accumulation  of  the  substance,   and  it becomes  impossible  to  obtain  a  package  of  compact  proportions when  several  bags  are  assembled  for  wrapping.<br>
By  reason  also  of  the  fact  that  the  ends  of  the  tubular blank  remain  open  when  the  envelopes  are  folded  double,   it can  happen  that  the  contents  drift  across  the  areas  where  the end  folds  are  to  be  made  subsequently,   thus  compromising  the efficiency  of  the  resulting  closures.<br>
A  second  method  of  manufacturing  this  type  of  filter  bag from  tubular  blanks   (see  IT  1  207   630)   comprises  the  step  of heat-sealing  the  closures  of  the  envelopes  before  forming  the central  pleat  and  then  folding  the  chambers  together.<br>
The  pleating  and  folding  steps  both  occur  remotely  from the  gripper  wheel  in  this  instance.   More  exactly,   the  blank is  folded  double  through  the  agency  of  specifically  designed transfer  means  by  which  the  blanks  are  forced  to  pass  through stationary  converging  rests,   so  that  the  envelopes  are  drawn gradually  together.<br>
In  this  method  there  is  obviously  no  possibility  that the  contents  of  the  envelopes  will  penetrate  the  respective closures,   since   these  are  secured  before  the  transfer  takes<br>
place;   nonetheless,   the  heat-sealed  closure  represents  an even  greater  drawback  due  to  the  risk  of  the  beverage  being contaminated  by  the  adhesive  utilized.<br>
Accordingly,   the  object  of  the  present  invention  is  to overcome  the  drawbacks  outlined  above.<br>
Disclosure  of  the  Invention<br>
The  stated  object   is  realized  in  a  pleating  and  folding method  as  characterized  by  the  appended  claims,   of  which  the salient  feature  is  substantially  that  it  comprises  a  step, effected  between  the  steps  of  forming  the  pleat  and  folding the  tubular  blank  around  the  pleat,   in  which  the  ends  of  the blank  are  pinched  by  the  action  of  movable  pressure  elements operating  in  conjunction  with  fixed  bearing  elements.   The purpose  of  such  a  pinching  step  is  to  prevent  the  contents  of the  envelopes  from  shifting  toward  the  ends  of  the  bag  during its  movement  toward  the  wheel.<br>
To  additional  advantage,   the  steps  of  forming  the  pleat and  folding  the  tubular  blank  around  the  pleat  are  effected both  simultaneously  and  through  the  agency  of  the  same  active elements.   This  allows  on  the  one  hand  of  achieving  shorter cycle  times,   and  on  the  other,   of  utilizing  machines  able  to perform  the  method  with  a  limited  number  of  working  parts:   a factor  bringing  clear  benefits  of  economy  in  construction  and reliability  in  operation.<br>
The  invention  will  now  be  described  in  detail,   by  way  of example,   with  the  aid  of  the  accompanying  drawings,   in  which: -   figs  1,   2   and  3   illustrate  a  succession  of  steps,   viewed schematically  in.  side  elevation  and  with  certain  details omitted,   reflecting  a  possible  implementation  of  the  method disclosed;<br>
Therefore, the present invention provides for a method of manufacturing a filter bag by pleating and folding an elongatedly shaped tubular blank of filter paper containing measured and separate quantities of an infusionable substance, so as to obtain a filter bag with two envelopes, comprising the steps of:<br>
conveying tubular blanks of filter paper singly and in succession along a feed direction extending tangential to a rotatable wheel equipped with radial grippers affording relative arms by which each filter bag is taken up, compacted and conveyed further;<br>
taking up a tubular blank in a position above at least three bearing elements ordered along the feed direction, of which two are stationary, shaped in such a way as to converge toward the wheel and offered to opposite ends of the tubular blank, whilst the third is capable of movement transversely to the feed direction; forming a pleat in an intermediate portion of the tubular blank; folding the tubular blank double in such a way as to draw the relative envelopes together, by inducing a movement that commences in the position at which the tubular blank is taken up and terminates at a position in which the tubular blank, guided by the stationary bearing elements, comes to rest between the arms of the gripper with the two ends close together; and<br>
comprising a further step, effected between the steps of forming the pleat and folding the tubular blank, in which the ends of the blank are pinched by the action of respective movable pressure elements operating in conjunction with the stationary bearing elements so as to prevent the contents of the envelopes from escaping during the movement of the bag toward the wheel.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The invention will now be described in detail, by way of example, with the aid of the<br>
accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
figs 1, 2 and 3 illustrate a succession of steps, viewed schematically in side elevation and with certain details omitted, reflecting a possible implementation of the method disclosed;<br>
-	fig  4  illustrates  a  bag  containing  a  substance  with  which<br>
to  prepare  an  infusion,   as  obtained  in  the  final  step  of  the<br>
method  disclosed.<br>
As  indicated  in  the  accompanying  drawings,   the  method  to which  the  invention  relates  is  one  of  pleating  and  folding  a tubular  blank  1  of  filter  paper,   elongated  in  appearance  and containing  measured  and  separate  quantities  of  a  substance with  which  to  prepare  an  infusion,   to  the  end  of  obtaining  a filter  bag  5  that  exhibits  two  distinct  envelopes  6,   as  shown in  fig  4.<br>
The  method  consists  essentially  in  the  steps  of:<br>
-	conveying  tubular  blanks  1  along  a  feed  direction;<br>
-	taking  up  a  tubular  blank  1  in  a  position  above  three bearing  elements  7,   8  and  9;<br>
-	fashioning  a  W-profiled  pleat  12  across  an  intermediate portion  10c  of  the  tubular  blank  1;<br>
-	pinching  the  ends  10a  and  10b  of  the  tubular  blank  1;<br>
-	folding  the  tubular  blank  1  double.<br>
In  the  initial  step,   the  tubular  blanks  1  are  caused  to advance  singly  and  in  succession  along  a  feed  direction  2 extending  substantially  tangential  to  a  rotatable  wheel  3 equipped  with  radial  grippers  4  affording  respective  pairs  of arms  15,   by  which  the  bags  5  are  taken  up  and  compacted   (see fig  1)   before  being  conveyed  further,   all  in  the  context  of  a process  implemented  with  packaging  equipment  of  conventional embodiment  not  illustrated  in  the  drawings.<br>
In  the  second  step,   a  tubular  blank  1  is  positioned  over the  three  bearing  elements   7,   8   and  9,   which  are  ordered  in sequence  along  the  feed  direction  2.   Two  of  the  elements   7 and  9  are  designed  to  receive  the  opposite  ends  10a  and  10b of   the  tubular  blank  1:   these  occupy  fixed  positions  and  are<br>
embodied  with  surfaces  converging  toward  the  wheel  3  beneath. The  third  element  9  is  capable  of  movement  transversely  in relation  to  the  feed  direction  2  and  performs  a  plurality  of functions:   as  discernible  from  the  drawings,   in  effect,   this same  bearing  element  8  also  assists  in  forming  the  pleat  12, and  accordingly  is  provided  with  a  forming  die  11  of  suitable shape  designed  to  interact  with  a  further  die  13  of  matching profile  carried  by  the  end  of  a  forming  element  14  positioned above  the  tubular  blank  1.<br>
The  step  of  pinching  the  ends  10a  and  10b  of  the  tubular blank  is  brought  about  through  the  agency  of  movable  pressure elements  16,   operating  in  conjunction  with  the  stationary bearing  elements  7  and  9,   which  engage  the  blank  1  in  such  a manner  as  to  prevent  the  contents  of  the  envelopes  6  from moving  toward  the  corresponding  ends  10a  and  10b.   Observing the  drawings,   it.will  be  appreciated  that  such  a  movement would  be  favoured  by  the  forces  of  inertia  generated  during the  initial  movement  of  the  bag  5  toward  the  wheel  3,   which is  characterized  by  a  certain  acceleration.<br>
At  the  same  time  as  the  pinching  action  is  applied,   the tubular  blank  1  is  also  folded  double  so  as  to  draw  the  two envelopes  6  together,   as  indicated  in  fig  2.   In  effect,   the folding  operation  begins  at  the  position  in  which  the  tubular blank  1  is  taken  up  onto  the  two  stationary  elements  7  and  9, and  terminates,   following  a  movement  guided  by  these  selfsame elements,   at  a  position  in  which  the  blank  1  lies  between  the arms   15  of  the  gripper  4  with  the   two  ends   10a  and  10b  drawn together   (fig  3).<br>
It  is  preferable  that  the  step  of  folding  the  tubular blank  1  should  be  implemented  simultaneously  with  the  step  of forming  the  pleat  12.   This  can  be  brought  about  by  causing<br>
the third bearing element 8 and the forming element 14, drawn into mutual engagement with the tubular blank 1 between them, to  move  together  as  one  toward  the  wheel.<br>
The  steps  of  the  method  described  thus   far  are  followed by  the  steps  of  returning  the  top  die  13   to  a  level  above that  of  the  plane  occupied  by  the  tubular  blanks  1  advancing along  the  feed  direction  2,   then  causing  the  third  element  8 to  disengage  from  the  bag  5  and  the  gripper  4  and  reassume  a position  of  readiness  to  engage  the  next  tubular  blank  1.   One possible  way  of  bringing  about  this  particular  step,   and  of implementing  the  method  in  general,   is  described  in  another application  for  patent  filed  in  the  same  name  as  the  present application:   it  will  be  seen  from  the  reference  in  question that  the  disengagement  might  be  effected  simply  by  rendering the  third  element  8  capable  also  of  translational  movement parallel  with  the  axis  20  of  the  wheel  3,   thereby  removing any  obstacle  to  the  movement  of  the  bag  5  and  the  gripper  4, hence  to  the  rotation  of  the  wheel  3.<br>
To  the  end  of  reducing  overall  cycle  times  when  carrying the  method  into  effect,   the  pinching  step  would  coincide  only with  the  initial  stage  of  the  folding  step.   In  effect,   the simultaneous  activation  of  these  two  steps  is  required  only while  there  is  an  acceleration  in  the  movement  of  the  bag, given  that  during  the  subsequent  deceleration  it  will  be  the selfsame  forces  of  inertia  that  tend  to  keep  the  contents  of the  envelopes  6  in  place  by  carrying  them  toward  the  bottom of  the  bag  5.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
