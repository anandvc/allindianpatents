2 APPLICANTS<br><br>
M/S MAHINDRA &amp; MAHINDRA LTD GATEWAY BUILDING, APOLLO BUNDER, FORT, MUMBAI 400001. MAHARASHTRA. INDIA A Company registered under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 NATIONALITY: INDIA <br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-                      <br>
                                                                                        Granted <br>
23-2-2005 <br><br><br><br>
Field Of Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to achieving maximum performance in the working of the Hydraulic lift system , Auxiliary valve system, Transmission lubrication system and alike system(s) used in tractor(s) or similar vehicle(s), by improving volumetric efficiency of it's oil pump(s). In the present invention a lower portion of a vehicle body (transmission housing) is used as a common reservoir for storing oil which is used for the functioning of above system(s) and by means of oil pump(s) means are provided for continuous supply of oil as per the system(s) requirement.<br>
Background Of the Invention :<br>
A vehicle(s) like traotor(s) or similar vehicle(s) (hereafter mentioned as vehiclefs]) provided with Hydraulic lift system, Auxiliary valve system, Transmission lubrication system and alike system(s) for its various applications. For the functioning of above system(s) oil pump(s) is provided in the vehicle, which sucks oil from the oil reservoir &amp; supplies oil to the various hydraulically operated system(s) at required flow rate. The hydraulic lift system &amp; auxiliary valve system are used to operate several vehicle attachments &amp; / or implements. Along with agricultural application these vehicle(s) can also be fitted with attachments used on earthmoving machinery like front-end loader, dozer, backhoe &amp; alike, which makes this machine versatile. Further transmission lubrication systern(s) is used for the lubrication of various transmission components.<br>
To supply sufficient oil quantity to all above means a lower portion of a vehicle body (transmission housing) is employed as a common oil reservoir. The common oil reservoir should be able to continuously supply oil to an oil pump(s) under various<br><br><br>
vehicle operating conditions like sideways tilting, moving upwards or downwards on a gradient and / or changeover for higher capacity pump(s). The performance of all oil operated system(s) strongly depends upon continuous supply of required oil in all above mentioned vehicle operating conditions, which in turn depends upon pump(s) volumetric efficiency.<br>
It is observed that a certain minimum oil level is required above the strainer located in the common oil reservoir for achieving maximum pump(s) volumetric efficiency. In common oil concept sometimes it is difficult to maintain required oil level at various vehicle operating conditions. This may leads to starvation of hydraulics pump(s), slower hydraulic lifting, reduced lifting capacity, increased oil temperature, reduced pump(s) life, increased transmission lubrication related failures and alike. The resulting effect of this will be, loss in machine(s) productivity and customer / consumer dissatisfaction.<br>
In current practices, for maintaining required oil level in a common oil reservoir, manufacturers of a vehicle(s) have provided plurality of holes in between different oil compartments, connected different oil compartments by means of pipes , located strainer at center of gravity of common oil reservoir, uses additional oil quantity. In spite of above solutions it is difficult to achieve maximum pump(s) volumetric efficiency as per the system(s) requirement at various vehicle operating conditions. Also these solutions are limited to the specific size of oil pump(s) and there will be further drop in pump(s) volumetric efficiency to changeover for higher size of oil pump(s).<br>
Therefore it is the requirement of a vehicle manufacture(s) to provide a means in the oil supply system(s), which will always insure required oil level in a common oil reservoir at various vehicle operating conditions. The said means will minimize oil return lead time while flowing from control valve to common oil reservoir. Thus increasing the<br><br><br><br>
pump(s) volumetric efficiency which further helps in achieving maximum performance of hydraulics lift system, auxiliary valve system, transmission lubrication system and alike hydraulically operated systems. Also the oil management system can be established in a vehicle with minimum oil quantity resulting cost saving. This provides benefits in terms of, increase in machine(s) productivity and achieving customer / consumer satisfaction.<br>
Summary of the Invention :<br>
The prime objective of this Invention is to achieve maximum performance of hydraulics lift system, auxiliary valve system, transmission lubrication system and alike hydraulically operated systems in a vehicle(s) like tractor(s) or similar vehicle(s) by improving oil pump(s) volumetric efficiency.<br>
As per the primary objective of this invention a means of oil reservoir chamber and duct is provided at the delivery side of control valve, which will ensure required oil level in a common oil reservoir, thereby achieving maximum oil pump(s) volumetric efficiency used in various hydraulics system(s) of a vehicle.<br>
Another objective of the present invention to achieve same and / or maximum performance of the above oil operated system(s) during various vehicle operating conditions like sideways tilting, moving upwards or downwards on a gradient &amp; other incline.<br>
It is additional advantage of this invention to achieve maximum performance of the oil operated system(s) with minimum oil quantity and at the same time avoid structural changes in a common oil reservoir required for improving oil pump(s) volumetric efficiency or changeover to higher size of oil pump(s).<br><br><br>
Brief description Of the Drawings :<br>
Figure 1 shows the common oil supplies system(s) used in a vehicle for achieving maximum performance of hydraulically operated system(s) during various operating conditions of a vehicle.<br>
Details descriptions of the preferred embodiments:<br>
Figure 1 shows the common oil supplies system(s) used in vehicle(s) like tractor(s) or similar vehicle(s). An oil supply system(s) for hydraulics lift system, auxiliary valve system &amp; other hydraulically operated system(s) comprising of, common oil reservoir, strainer (oil filtration 7), suction line (8), oil pump (9), delivery line (10), auxiliary valve (11), control valve (12), oil chamber (13), duct (14), interconnecting oil supply lines (16,20,21). During working of these system(s) said oil pump (9) sucks oil available in a common oil reservoir from suction line (8) through strainer (7). Said common oil reservoir is formed by lower portion of a vehicle body (transmission housing) such as rear compartment (6), range compartment (5), speed compartment (4), shuttle compartment (3) &amp; other compartments of vehicle body. Oil is being supplied as per the required flow rate to various oil operated system(s) through delivery line (10), which is used by increasing it's pressure for the functioning of these system(s). During functioning of the system(s), high pressure oil in the oil supply system(s) is thrown back into the oil chamber (13), provided on the delivery side of control valve (12) through delivery port. High pressure oil collected in the oil chamber (13), is then diverted again towards the suction point i.e. at strainer (7), located on suction side at suitable location in a common oil reservoir where the maximum oil level is always maintained at different vehicle operating conditions through duct (14). Thus the unique arrangement of oil chamber (13) and duct (14) allows high pressure oil which is in the form of jet &amp; / or sprinkle reach to the suction point in a common oil reservoir very fast. Therefore reduces the lead time between suction and delivery of oil,<br><br><br><br>
used for the functioning of various oil operated system(s), which in turn doesn't allow oil level to move below the required oil level (18) in a common oil reservoir. Thus ensure maximum volumetric efficiency of the oil pump(s) (9), which further ensures working of hydraulics lift system, auxiliary valve system &amp; alike hydraulically operated system(s) to full of its expectations.<br>
On other part of it since required oil level is maintained in a common oil reservoir which improve the volumetric efficiency of scavenging pump (17) there by achieving better performance of transmission lubrication system comprising of said common oil reservoir, suction line (15), scavenging pump (17), lubricating lines &amp; passages (16).<br>
Hence achieving maximum performance of hydraulics lift system, auxiliary valve system and transmission lubricating system &amp; alike oil operated system(s) by improving volumetric efficiency of the pump(s) being used for supplying required oil quantity.<br><br><br>
