				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
Aminoketone Asymmetric Reductase and Nucleic Acid thereof Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an aminoketone asymmetric reductase, a nucleic acid coding the enzyme, a microorganism producing the enzyme, and a met hod of producing an optically active aminoalcohol using them. Background Art<br>
Ephedrines have conventionally been used for sweating, alleviating fever, suppressing coughs, and so forth. Among them,  d-pseudoephedrine has been known to have  an antiinflammatory effect. On the other hand, 1-ephedrine has been known to have pharmacological effects for constricting blood vessels, increasing blood pressure, sweating, and the like, and is medically in use as a sympathomimetic agent.  Also, 1-ephedrine is used for curing bronchial asthma. Hence, a method of producing an optically active p-aminoalcohol including an optically active ephedrine is useful in the pro cess of making a medicine or its intermediates, whereby an effective producing method is desired.<br>
Conventionally used as a method of producing a (3-aminoalcohol  having  a  desirable  optical  activity comprises the steps of yielding a racemic (3-aminoalcohol, and then producing a specific optically active substance by an optical resolution, asymmetric synthesis, or the like.<br>
Since the racemic 3-aminoalcohol has two asymmetric carbons within its molecular, however, a complicated step has been necessary for yielding a specific optically active substance.<br>
For example, Ger. (East) 13683, Aug. 27, 1957 reported that, in the case of an optically active ephedrine which is       a       kind       of       3~aminoalcohol, erythro-l-2-methylamino-l-phenyl-l-propanol,      i.e., 1-ephedrine  can  be  produced by  reducing/condensing methylamine with an optically active phenylacetylcarbinol obtained from benzaldehyde by fermentation utilizing a yeast.<br>
It was further reported that a pseudoephedrine can be made by producing oxazoline from 1-ephedrine by acetic anhydride, thenhydrolyzing it, and inverting it to its threo form, i.e., d-pseudoephedrine (U.S. Patent No. 4237304).<br>
As mentioned above, making pseudoephedrine having a desirable optical activity from l-phenyl-2-methylamino-l-propanone necessitates a step of yielding an optically active erythro form of ephedrine and then inverting it into a threo form, thereby increasing and complicating the number of steps and lowering the yield.<br>
Further, the above-mentioned making of pseudoephedrine yields a considerable amount of diastereomer as a byproduct when reducing a material ketone substance, whereas the diastereomer is hard to recover as<br>
a material, which has been economically disadvantageous.<br>
On the other hand, though the method disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. HEI 8-98697 can produce an optically active 2-amino-l-phenylethanol derivative from a 2-amino-l-phenylethanol compound having one asymmetric carbon atom within its molecule by using a specific microorganism, no effective method of producing a (B-aminoalcohol having two asymmetric carbon atoms has been known yet.

In the following, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be explained in detail.<br>
When nucleotides, amino acids, and the like are expressed by their abbreviations in the specification and drawings, they are based on IUPAC-IUB Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature or meanings of words conventionally used in this field. Optical isomers of amino acids will be represented by their L-form unless otherwise specified.<br>
First, the protein of the present invention will be explained.<br>
The protein of the present invention is a protein,<br>
which is an aminoketone asymmetric reductase, having an effect of producing d-pseudoephedrine by acting on 1-2-methylaminopropiophenone, and having the following physiochemical properties:<br>
substrate: 1-2-methylaminopropiophenone optimum pH: pH 8.1 optimum temperature: 55°C coenzyme: NADP<br>
molecular weight: about 28500 Da homotetramer The said protein not only has an effect of producing d-pseudoephedrine         by        acting        on 1-2-methylaminopropiophenone,  but  also  exhibits  a reduction      activity     with      respect      to 1-2-dimethylaminopropiophenone,    aminoacetone,    and l-amino-2-butanone. Also, it acts on l-amino-2-propanol, thereby producing aminoacetone.<br>
As properties other than the physiochemical properties mentioned above, influences of variousmetal ions or inhibitors have been studied, whereby inhibitions by a,a'-Dipyridyl, o-Phenanthrolin, and EDTA have been confirmed.<br>
The said protein is obtained by culturing a microorganism having an aminoketone asymmetric reduction activity, and purifying from the resulting cell.<br>
The culturing method is not restricted in particular, and known methods can be employed as long as it can grow<br>
the microorganism in use.  Normally, a liquid medium including a carbon source, a nitrogen source, and other nutrients is used. Any carbon source is usable as long as the  above-mentioned  microorganism  can  utilize  it. Specifically, sugars such as glucose, fructose, sucrose, dextrin, starch, and sorbitol; alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, and glycerol; organic acids such as fumaric acid, citric acid, acetic acid, and propionic acid, and their salts; hydrocarbons such as paraffin; their mixtures; or the like can be used. Any nitrogen source is usable as long as the above-mentioned microorganism can utilize it. Specifically, ammonium salts of inorganic acids such as ammonium  chloride,  ammonium  sulfate,  and  ammonium phosphate; ammonium salts of organic acids such as ammonium fumarate and ammonium citrate; nitrates such as sodium nitrate  and  potassium  nitrate;  nitrogen-containing inorganic or organic compounds such as meat extracts, yeast extracts, malt extracts, and peptone; their mixtures; or the like can be used.  Nutrient sources used for normal culture such as inorganic salts, trace metal salts, and vitamins may also be added to the culture as appropriate. Substances  accelerating  the  proliferation  of  the microorganism, buffer substances effective in keeping the pH of the medium, and the like may also be added to the culture if necessary.<br>
The microorganism can be cultured under a condition<br>
suitable for its growth. Specifically, the culture can be carried out in a medium with a pH of 3 to 10, preferably 4 to 9, and a temperature of 0°C to 50°C, preferably 20°C to 40°C. The microorganism can be cultured under aerobic or anaerobic conditions. The culture time is preferably 10 to 150 hours, and should be determined appropriately depending on each microorganism.<br>
From thus cultured microorganism, its culture medium is filtered or centrifuged, so as to obtain cells, which are then washed well with water or a buffer solution. The washed cells are suspended in an appropriate amount of buffer solution, and the cells are disrupted. The disruption method is not restricted in particular, examples of which include mechanical disruption methods using a mortar, a DYNO-Mill, a French press, a ultrasonic disrupter, and the like. From thus obtained homogenate of the cells, solids are removed by filtration or centrifuge, and from thus obtained cell-free extracts, the aminoketone asymmetric reductase is collected by a normal method of enzyme isolation.<br>
Such an enzyme isolation method is not restricted in particular, and known methods can be used therefor. For example, the enzyme can be purified by salting out such as ammonium sulfate sedimentation; gel filtration by Sephadex or the like; ion-exchange chromatography using a carrier having a diethylaminoethyl group, a carboxymethyl group,<br>
or the like; hydrophobia chromatography using a carrier having a hydrophobia group such as butyl group, octyl group, or phenyl group; pigment gel chromatography; electrophoresis; dialysis; ultrafiltration; affinity chromatography; high-performance liquid chromatography; and the like.<br>
Further, the said enzyme can be used as an immobilized enzyme. Such a method is not restricted in particular, and known methods can be used, examples of which include immobilized enzymes and enzyme-producing cells, which can be immobilized by carrier binding such as covalent binding and adsorption, crosslinking, entrapment, and the like. Condensing agents such as glutaraldehyde, hexamethylene diisocyanate, and hexamethylene diisothiocyanate may also be used as necessary.  Examples of other immobilizing methods include a monomer method gelling a monomer by polymerization reaction; a prepolymer method polymerizing a molecule greater than a normal monomer; a polymer method gelling a polymer; immobilization using polyacrylamide; immobilization using natural polymers such as alginic acid, collagen,  gellatin,  agar,  and  K-carrageenan;  and immobilization  using  synthetic  polymers  such  as photocurable resins and urethane polymers.<br>
Thus pur if led enzyme is considered to be fully purified if a single band is confirmed by electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE or the like).<br>

Also, the protein of the present invention is a protein comprising the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID N0:l in the Sequence Listing; andprotein derived from the protein comprising the said amino acids sequence, comprising deletion, insertion, substitution or addition of one or more<br>
amino acids, and having an aminoketone asymmetric reduction activity.<br>
The method of providing such a deletion, insertion, substituion, or addition is not restricted in particular, and known methods can be used.  Examples of the methods include those described in the Japanese Biochemical Society, ed., "Sequel to Biochemical Experiment Lecture 1, Gene Study Method II", p. 105 (Susumu Hirose), Tokyo Kagaku Dojin (1986);  the Japanese Biochemical Society,  ed.,  "New Biochemical Experiment Lecture  2,  Nucleic Acid III (Recombinant DNA Technique) ", p. 233 (Susumu Hirose) , Tokyo Kagaku Dojin (1992); R. Wu, L. Grossman, ed., "Methods in Enzymology", Vol. 154, p. 350 &amp; p. 367, Academic Press, New York (1987);R.Wu, L.Grossman, ed., "Methods in Enzymology", Vol. 100, p. 467 &amp; p. 468, Academic Press, New York (1983) ; J.A. Wells et al., "Gene", Vol. 34, p. 315 (1985); T. Grundstroem et al., "Nucleic Acids Res.", Vol. 13, p. 3305 (1985); J. Taylor et al., "Nucleic Acids Res.", Vol. 13, p. 8765 (1985); R. Wu ed., "Methods in Enzymology", Vol. 155, p. 568, Academic Press, New York (1987); and A.R. Oliphant et al., "Gene", Vol. 44, p. 177 (1986).  Specific examples include site-directedmutagenesis (site-specified mutagenesis) , Kunkel method, and dNTP [aS] method (Eckstein method) utilizing a synthetic oligonucleotide or the like, and region-specific mutagenesis using sulfurous acid, nitrous acid, or the like.<br>
There are cases where sugar chains are added to many proteins, whereby the addition of sugar chains can be regulated by substituting one or more amino acids. Therefore, the protein of the present invention encompasses proteins having the above-mentioned sugar chains regulated in the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID N0:l in the Sequence Listing as long as they have the above-mentioned aminoketone asymmetric reduction activity.<br>
Thus obtained protein of the present invention can be modified by amino acid residues contained therein by a chemical technique, or can be altered into its derivatives by modification or partial decomposition using enzymes such as peptidases, e.g., pepsin, chymotrypsin, papain, bromelain, endopeptidase, and exopeptidase.<br>
When the protein is produced by gene recombination, it may be expressed as a fusion protein, and then be converted/processed in vivo or in vitro into one having a biological activity substantially the same as that of a natural aminoketone asymmetric reductase.

It also seems that the present invention may encompass those having a primary structure conformation substantially equivalent to that of the natural aminoketone asymmetric reductase or a part thereof,  and  those  having  a  biological  activity substantially equivalent to that of the natural aminoketone asymmetric reductase.  Further, the present invention may encompass one of naturally occurring mutants.

The nucleic acid of the present invention will now be explained.<br>
The nucleic acid of the present invention is a nucleic acid coding a protein comprising the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID N0:l in the Sequence Listing.<br>
Since there are a plurality of nucleotide sequences (codons) coding one amino acid, there are a number of nucleic acid coding the protein comprising the amino acid sequence<br>
set forth in SEQ ID N0:l in the Sequence Listing. Such nucleic acids are also included in the nucleic acid of the present invention. Here, "coding a protein" means to encompass those having a nucleotide sequence coding one of two complementary chains of DNAif DNAhas two chains, whereby the nucleic acid of the present invention also encompasses . nucleic acids comprising nucleotide sequences directly coding the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID N0:l in the Sequence Listing, or nucleic acids comprising nucleotide sequences complementary thereto.<br>
Also, the nucleic acid of the present invention is a nucleic acid comprising the nucleotide sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:2 in the Sequence Listing.<br>
The nucleotide sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 2 in the Sequence Listing is the nucleotide sequence of DNA obtained by extracting genome DNA from the above-mentioned microorganism, and then subjecting it to PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) using a synthetic oligonucleotide primer designed according to the amino acid sequence of aminoketone asymmetric reductase.<br>
Though the method of extracting genome DNA from the above-mentioned microorganism is not restricted in particular, for example, cells of microoganism obtained by culture (e.g., Rhodococcus erythropolis MAK-34 strain) are disrupted, chromosome DNA is centrifuged by a normal method, RNA is thereafter decomposed and removed, and<br>
deproteinization is carried out, so as to purify DNA. For these operations, reference can be made to "Plant Biotechnology Experiment Manual", Noson-Bunkasha, p. 252. Any microorganism capable of producing an aminoketone asymmetric reductase belonging to the genus Rhodococcus can favorably be used as a DNA source.<br>
As the method of preparing the oligonucleotide primer used in the above-mentioned PCR, known methods can be used, whereby the synthetic oligonucleotide primer is prepared according to amino acid information of aminoketone asymmetric reductase.<br>
For example, the synthetic oligonucleotide primer can be prepared according to amino acid information of a purified aminoketone  asymmetric  reductase  obtained  from  the above-mentioned microorganism capable of producing an aminoketone  asymmetric  reductase.    In  general,  a degenerated primer or the like is prepared according to the amino acid sequence.  The primer can be prepared by methods known in this field. For example, it can be synthesized by  phosphodiester  method,  phosphotriester  method, phoshoramidite  method,  or  the  like  using  a  DNA autosynthesizer.  Specifically, an aminoketone asymmetric reductase is purified from cells obtained by culturing Rhodococcus erythropolis in a nutrient medium, and is segmented by a peptide hydrolase if necessary, so as to collect information about the amino acid sequence of the<br>
enzyme.  From thus obtained information of the amino acid sequence, a preferable synthetic oligonucleotide primer is prepared. Using this primer, PCR is carried out with the genome DNA of aminoketone asymmetric reductase employed as a template.  The PCR reaction can be carried out by known methods in this field, methods substantially the same thereto, or altered methods.  For example, it can be carried out according to methods described in R. Saiki, etal., Science, Vol. 230, pp. 1350 (1985); R. Saiki, et al., Science, Vol. 239, pp. 487 (1988); and Henry A. Erlich, PCR Technology, Stockton Press .  The reaction canbe carried out, for example, by utilizing commercially available kits and reagents.<br>
The resulting amplified DNA fragments is sequenced, is confirmed to include a sequence homologous to the amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme, and is labeled with an isotope, so as to be used as a probe for subsequent experiments and the like.  The nucleotide sequence can be determined by dideoxy methods such as Ml 3 dideoxy method, for example, Maxam-Gilbert method, and the like.  The determination can be carried out by using commercially available sequencing kits such as Taq dye primer cycle sequencing kit, for example, automatic sequencer such as fluorescent DNA sequencer, for example, and the like.  For labeling the probe or the like with a radioisotope or the like, commercially available labeling kits such as random primed DNA labeling kit (Boehringer Mannhaim) can be used,<br>
for example.<br>
The gene of aminoketone asymmetric reductase of the<br>
present invention can be cloned by the following method,<br>
for example.  Specifically,  for example, the genetic<br>
