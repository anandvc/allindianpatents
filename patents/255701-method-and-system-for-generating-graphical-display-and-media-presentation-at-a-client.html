METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR GENERATING GRAPHICAL DISPLAY AND<br>
MEDIA PRESENTATION AT A CLIENT<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Cross-Reference to Related Application<br>
[0001J This application claims priority to co-pending U.S. patent application number<br>
10/098,157, filed March 14,2002, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Field Of Invention<br>
[0002] The invention generally relates to distributed processing, and, more particularly, to<br>
generating a display having graphical and/or media components at a client.<br>
Description of Prior Art<br>
[0003] A thin-client protocol is used for displaying output, produced by an application<br>
running on a server, on a client with limited processing capabilities. Two exemplary thin client<br>
protocols are ICA, Independent Computing Architecture from Citrix Systems, Inc., Ft.<br>
Lauderdale, FL and RDP, Remote Desktop Protocol from Microsoft, Inc., Redmond, WA. The<br>
client is also sometimes referred to as a remote terminal session. One thin-client protocol	<br>
intercepts commands by the application program to the server operating system ("OS") to draw<br>
to a display screen. The intercepted commands are transmitted to the remote session using, for<br>
example, one or more presentation layer packets. When the remote session (e.g., thin-client)<br>
receives the command, the remote session passes the received commands to the remote session<br>
OS. The thin-client draws the application program output on its display using the received<br>
commands. In this manner, the application program appears to be executing on the thin-client.<br>
[0004] Typically, when the application program draws images to the display screen, the<br>
image is represented as a bitmap. A bitmap format of an image is generally a very large data set<br>
Thus, the thin-client protocol must transmit over the network the bitmap representation of an<br>
image, which is a large amount of data, along With the applicable commands on how to display<br>
the bitmap representation. For networks of low bandwidth, this results in a large time delay<br>
before the complete image is received and displayed on the client. This can result in<br>
inconvenience and unhappiness for the user of the client. Also, if the user is paying directly for<br>
bandwidth used, for example in a wireless network, transmission of these large bitmap formats<br>
results in large costs associated with each transmission.<br><br>
[0005] A similar problem exists when the application program renders a media presentation.<br>
Typically, a video file is rendered as a series of bitmaps and audio information is rendered using<br>
pulse code modulation. Accordingly, the thin-client protocol transmits the series of bitmaps<br>
representing the video file and/or the pulse code modulated signal representing the audio<br>
information over the network. This transmission is inefficient, requiring excessive bandwidth<br>
and significant CPU usage. Moreover, even where sufficient bandwidth is available, an<br>
unresponsive graphical user interface may result at the client. Video playback, for example, is<br>
often of low quality, may appear "jerky," and may synchronize poorly with the audio<br>
presentation.<br>
[0006] There is, therefore, a need for an improved approach to rendering images and media<br>
presentations in a remote terminal session.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007] The invention, according to one advantage, lowers the time and cost of transmitting images and other non-textual elements, originally represented in large bitmap formats, by 	<br>
substituting, prior to transmission, available compressed formats for the bitmap formats.	<br>
Typically, transmitting the compressed formats instead of the bitmap formats can significantly reduce the necessary bandwidth. The client decompresses the received data using available	<br>
libraries. The client then substitutes the decompressed image for the original bitmap	<br>
representations using, for example, modified thin-client protocol commands with other<br>
identifying data.<br>
[0008] According to another advantage of the invention, a compressed data set, representing<br>
at least a portion of a media stream, is intercepted on a first computing device before it is<br>
decompressed. Alternatively, where the compressed data set is decompressed on the first<br>
computing device, the resulting decompressed data set is re-compressed on the first computing<br>
device. By transmitting the compressed data set, rather than the decompressed data set, over a<br>
network, which may have limited bandwidth, the time and cost of transmitting the data set is<br>
consequently reduced.<br>
[0009] In one aspect, the invention relates to a method for generating a graphical display at a<br>
client. The method includes transmitting output from an application program executing on a<br>
server to the client, identifying a bitmap representation within the application output, and<br>
determining a check value for the bitmap representation. The method also includes retrieving a<br>
compressed data format of the bitmap representation using at least in part the check value and<br>
transmitting to the client the compressed data format in place of the bitmap representation.<br><br>
[0010] In another aspect, the invention relates to a method for generating a graphical display<br>
at a client. The method includes transmitting output from an application program executing on a<br>
server to the client and identifying a non-textual element within the application output. The<br>
method also includes retrieving a compressed data format associated with the non-textual<br>
element and transmitting to the client the compressed data format in place of the non-textual<br>
element.<br>
[0011] In one embodiment of this aspect of the invention, the method includes identifying a<br>
textual element within the application output and transmitting to the client the textual element.<br>
In another embodiment, the method includes receiving the compressed data format, and<br>
optionally the textual element, at the client and generating a display at the client using the<br>
compressed data format, and optionally the textual element. In another embodiment, the method<br>

packet. In yet another embodiment, the method includes transmitting the at least one<br>
presentation layer protocol packet using a command for transmitting a file in its native format.<br>
[0012] In another embodiment, the method includes conforming the at least one presentation<br>
layer protocol packet to a remote access protocol, a thin-client protocol, and/or a presentation<br>
protocol. In still another embodiment, the non-textual element is a bitmap representation and the<br>
method includes replacing the bitmap representation with the compressed data format. In<br>
another embodiment, the method includes determining the capability of the client to render the<br>
non-textual element using the compressed data format. The method further includes, upon<br>
determination that the client cannot render the non-textual element using the compressed data<br>
format, transmitting an image-rendering library capable of rendering the non-textual element<br>
using the compressed data format.<br>
[0013] In another embodiment, the method includes intercepting the application output and<br>
inspecting the intercepted output for a bitmap representation of the non-textual element. In yet<br>
another embodiment, the method includes calculating a first check value for a bitmap<br>
representation of the non-textual element and searching an image store for the compressed data<br>
format having a check value identical to the first check value.<br>
[0014] In another aspect, the invention relates to a system for generating a graphical display<br>
at a client. The system includes an output filter module and aserver agent. The output filter<br>
module is configured to intercept output produced by an application program, identify a non-<br>
textual element of the output, and retrieve a compressed data format associated with the non-<br><br>
textual element. The server agent is configured to transmit to the client the compressed data<br>
format in place of the non-textual element.	<br>
[0015] In one embodiment of this aspect of the invention, the system includes a server node,<br>
which includes the server agent and the output filter module. In another embodiment, the system<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0036] In one aspect, the invention pertains to methods, systems, and articles of manufacture<br>
for generating a graphical display. A compressed data format, associated with a non-textual<br>
element or a bitmap representation of an image, is transmitted over a network from a server to a<br>
client, in place of the non-textual element or the bitmap representation, for subsequent display.<br>
[0037] In broad overview, FIG. 1 illustrates a system 100 to generate a display for a remote<br>
terminal session that includes a first computing system ("client node") 105 in communication<br>
with a second computing system ("server node") 110 over a network 115. For example, the<br>
network 115 can be a local-area network (LAN), such as a company Intranet, or a wide area<br>
network (WAN), such as the Internet or the World Wide Web. A user of the client node 105 can<br>
be connected to the network 115 through a variety of connections including standard telephone<br>
lines, LAN or WAN links (e.g., Tl, T3, 56kb, X.25), broadband connections (ISDN, Frame<br>
Relay, ATM), and wireless connections. The client node 105 includes a client transceiver 130 to<br>
establish communication with the network 115. The server node 110 includes a server<br>
transceiver 135 to establish communication with the network 115. The connections can be<br>
established using a variety of communication protocols (e.g., ICA, RDP, HTTP, TCP/IP, IPX,<br>
SPX, NetBIOS, Ethernet, RS232, and direct asynchronous connections).<br>
[0038] The server node 110 can be any computing device capable of providing the requested<br>
services of the client node 105. Particularly, this includes generating and transmitting commands<br>
and data to the client node 105 that represent the output being produced by an application<br>
program 140 executing on the server 110. The server node 110 includes the server transceiver<br>
135, the executing application program 140, a server agent 150, an output filter module 155 and<br>
an image store 160. The server agent 150 includes a module that interfaces with a client agent<br>
175 and other components of the server node 110 to support the remote display and operability<br>
of the application program 140. The server agent module 150 and all modules mentioned<br>
throughout the specification are implemented as a software program and/or a hardware device<br>
(e.g., ASICs or FPGAs). 	<br>
[0039] For clarity, all of these components are shown on server node 110. It is to be<br>
understood that the server node 110 can represent a single server or can represent several servers<br>
in communication with each over the network 115 or another network (not shown). In multiple<br>
server embodiments, the functionality of the components can be distributed over the available<br>
servers. For example, in one embodiment with multiple servers, the transceiver 135, the<br>
application program 140, the server agent 150 and the output filter module 155 are on an<br><br>
application server and the image store 160 is on a storage device, such as a disk in a RAID<br>
system.<br>
[0040] The client node 105 can be any computing device (e.g., a personal computer, set top<br>
box, wireless mobile phone, handheld device, personal digital assistant, kiosk, etc.) used to<br>
provide a user interface to the application program 140 executing on the server node 110. The<br>
client node 105 includes the client transceiver 130, a display 145, a client agent 175 and a<br>
graphics library 180 (also referred to as an image-rendering library). The client agent 175<br>
includes a module, implemented as a software program and/or a hardware device (e.g., an ASIC<br>
or an FPGA) that receives commands and data from the server node 110 and from a user (not<br>
shown) of the client node 105. The client agent 175 uses the received information when<br>
interacting with other components of the client node 105 (e.g., when directing the operating<br>
system to output data onto the display 145). The client agent 175 also transmits requests and<br>
data to the server node 110 in response to server-issued commands or user actions at the client<br>
node 105.<br>
[0041] The server node 110 hosts one or more application programs 140 that can be accessed<br>
by the client nodes 105. Examples of such applications include word processing programs such<br>
as MICROSOFT Word and spreadsheet programs such as MICROSOFT Excel, both<br>
manufactured by Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Washington. Other examples include<br>
financial reporting programs, customer registration programs, programs providing technical<br>
support information, customer database applications, and application set managers. Another<br>
example of an application program is Internet Explorer, manufactured by Microsoft Corporation<br>
of Redmond, Washington, and this program will be used as an exemplary application program<br>
140 in the following discussion. It is understood that other application programs can be used.<br>
[0042] During execution of the application program 140, for example Internet Explorer, the<br>
server node 110 communicates with the client node 105 over a transport mechanism. In one<br>
embodiment, the transport mechanism provides multiple virtual channels 185 through the<br>
network 115 so the server agent 150 can communicate with the client agent 175. One of the<br>
virtual channels 185 provides a protocol for transmitting graphical screen data from the server<br>
node 110 to the client node 105. The server 110 executes a protocol driver, in one embodiment<br>
as part of the server agent 150, that intercepts graphical display interface commands generated<br>
by the application program 140 and targeted at the server's operating system. The protocol<br>
driver translates the commands into a protocol packet suitable for transmission over the transport<br>
mechanism.<br><br>
[0043] The application program 140, in this example Internet Explorer, executing on the<br>
server 110, retrieves a web page. As explained above, the application program 140 generates<br>
graphical display commands to the server operating system, as if it was going to display the<br>
output at the server node 110. The server agent 150 intercepts these commands and transmits<br>
them to the client agent 175. The client agent 175 issues the same or similar commands to the<br>
client operating system to generate output for the display 145 of the client node 105.<br>
[0044J In one embodiment, a web page has both textual elements (e.g., titles, text, and ASCII<br>
characters) and non-textual elements (e.g., images, photos, icons, and splash screens)<br>
incorporated therein. The non-textual elements are sometimes transmitted to the Internet<br>
Explorer application program 140 from a web server (not shown) in a compressed data format<br>
(e.g., a file or a data stream), also referred to as the non-textual element's native format.<br>
Examples of compressed formats are JPEG, GIF, and PNG. The non-textual element<br>
represented in a compressed data format may be, for example, 20 kilobytes in size. That same<br>
non-textual element decompressed into its bitmap representation is, for example, 300 kilobytes<br>
in size.<br>
[0045] The application program 140, when generating the display of the web page, retrieves,<br>
for example, a JPEG data format of a non-textual element and decompresses the JPEG data<br>
format into a bitmap for display. The output filter module 155 determines that the bitmap<br>
representation is from a compressed format and obtains the corresponding compressed format of<br>
the non-textual element from the image store 160, as explained in more detail below. In one<br>
embodiment, the image store 160 is persistent storage. In other embodiments, the image store<br>
160 is temporary storage, cache, volatile memory and/or a combination of temporary and<br>
persistent storage.<br>
[0046] The server agent 150 replaces the bitmap representation of the non-textual element<br>
with the compressed non-textual element that the output filter module 155 retrieved from the<br>
image store 160. The server agent 150 transmits the non-textual element in the compressed<br>
format, along with the graphical display interface commands associated with the bitmap<br>
representation, to the client node 105. In one embodiment the server agent 150 uses a unique<br>
protocol command that identifies a transmission of a non-textual element that is not in bitmap<br>
representation, even though the associated commands are applicable to a bitmap representation<br>
of a non-textual element. In other embodiments other identifying techniques can be used. For<br>
example, the protocol command can have a modifier comment, or a command switch. The<br>
command can also use a change of context or a combination of multiple commands.<br><br>
[0047] The client agent 175 receives the transmission of the non-textual element file in the<br>
compressed data format, along with the graphical display interface commands associated with<br>
the bitmap representation of the non-textual element. The client agent 175 determines that the<br>
non-textual element is in the compressed data format and not the bitmap representation. In one<br>
embodiment, the client agent 175 makes this determination because the non-textual element in<br>
compressed format is transmitted using a unique protocol command. In another embodiment, the<br>
size of the non-textual element data and/or other characteristics about the non-textual element<br>
included with the associated graphical display interface commands are enough to enable the<br>
client agent 175 to make the determination.<br>
[0048] The client agent 175 determines whether the client node 105 contains the necessary<br>
library 180 to decompress the compressed format of the non-textual element. If the client node<br>
105 has the appropriate graphics Iibrary(ies) 180 installed to perform the decompression<br>
algorithms, the client agent 175 uses the library 180 to decompress the compressed format of the<br>
non-textual element into its bitmap representation. The client agent 175 performs the received<br>
associated graphical display interface commands on the bitmap representation to generate the<br>
non-textual element of the output of the application program 140 on the client display 145.<br>
[0049] In one embodiment, the client agent 175 does not contain all the decompression<br>
algorithms to decompress the non-textual element from a compressed fonnat into a bitmap<br>
representation. If the client node 105 does not have the appropriate graphics library(ies) 180<br>
installed to perform the decompression algorithms, the client agent 175 requests the needed<br>
graphics library from the server node 110. In another embodiment, the client agent 175<br>
determines if a predetermined set of the most widely used graphics libraries 180 are installed on<br>
the client node 105 prior to receiving any non-textual elements from the server node 110. If the<br>
most widely used graphics libraries 180 are not installed on the client node 105, the client agent<br>
175 requests the missing libraries from the server node 110 prior to receiving any non-textual<br>
elements from the server node 110.<br>
[0050] In yet another embodiment, the client agent 175 determines which graphics libraries<br>
180 the client node 105 includes and transmits that library information to the server agent 150.<br>
In this embodiment, when the server agent 150 receives the compressed data format of a bitmap<br>
representation from the output filter module 155, the server agent 150 determines, using the<br>
transmitted library information, whether the client node 105 can render the compressed data<br>
format. If the server agent 150 determines that the client node 105 has the applicable library, the<br>
server agent 150 substitutes the compressed data format for the bitmap representation of the non-<br><br>
textual element. If the server agent 150 determines that the client node 105 does not have the<br>
applicable library, the server agent 150 does not substitute the compressed data format for the<br>
bitmap representation of the non-textual element and instead transmits the bitmap representation<br>
to the client 105.<br>
[0051] For the server agent 150 to replace the bitmap representation of the non-textual<br>
element with the non-textual element in the compressed format, the output filter module 155<br>
determines that the bitmap representation is from a compressed format contained in the image<br>
store 160. To make this determination, the output filter module 155 calculates one or more<br>
check values for the bitmap representation. For example, the output filter module 155 can<br>
calculate a single check value for the entire bitmap representation and/or the output filter module<br>
155 can calculate four check values, one for each quadrant for the entire bitmap representation.<br>
In another example, the output filter module 155 can calculate N check values, one for each of<br>
the N lines in the bitmap representation. A check value is the result of an algorithm that<br>
generates a substantially unique value for different arrangements of data. The check value is, for<br>
example, a checktag, a Cyclic Redundancy Code ("CRC"), a check sum, or a result of a hashing<br>
function. The check value is based on the bitmap representation and not the data as arranged in a<br>
compressed data format. However, when the compressed data format is stored in the image store<br>
160, it is stored with a check value attribute that corresponds to the one or more check values of<br>
the bitmap representation of the compressed data when decompressed.<br>
[0052] In one embodiment, the check value is a checktag that includes a fixed identifier and<br>
a unique identifier. The fixed identifier and the unique identifier are combined together and<br>
concealed within an image. The fixed identifier is used to identify the checktag as such; the<br>
unique identifier is used to identify a specific image. The fixed identifier is, for example, a<br>
globally unique identifier that is statistically unlikely to be found within a image. For example,<br>
the fixed identifier is a byte sequence that is easily recognizable during debugging and that has a<br>
balanced number of zero and one bits. The unique identifier is a sequential identifier uniquely<br>
allocated for each image in the cache. The sequential unique identifier is XOR masked with<br>
another value so that the image identifiers with a small value (the most likely value) will be more<br>
likely to have a balanced number of zero and one bits.<br>
[0053] The checktag is encoded into RGB color components, independently of whether the<br>
RGB components are part of the image or part of the color palette. More specifically, the<br>
checktag is treated as a stream of 160 bits (i.e., 20 separate bytes, each of which starts at bit 0,<br>
the least significant, and finishes at bit 7, the most significant bit). The least significant bit of<br><br>
each byte is overwritten by the next bit of the checktag. The other 7 bits of each byte remain<br>
unaltered.<br>
[0054] A checktag is decoded by simply reversing the encoding procedure. After the<br>
checktag is decoded, the fixed identifier and the unique identifier are retrieved from the<br>
checktag. The retrieved fixed identifier is validated against a previously stored fixed identifier to<br>
identify the checktag as such. Where a match is found, the unique identifier is then used to<br>
retrieve information that is relevant to the identified image, such as the bitmap data associated<br>
with the image.<br>
[0055] The output filter module 155 searches the image store 160 for a non-textual element<br>
in compressed data format that has a check value attribute that is the same as one or more check<br>
values the output filter module 155 calculates for the bitmap representation. The output filter<br>
module 155 retrieves the compressed format of non-textual element with the same check value<br>
attribute as the one or more check values and sends the compressed format of the non-textual<br>
element to the server agent 150 for transmittal to the client agent 175 in place of the bitmap<br>
representation.<br>
[0056] The server node 110 stores compressed formats of non-textual elements in the image<br>
store 160 the first time the application program 140 calls a graphics library (not shown) to create<br>
a bitmap representation from a compressed format file. The output filter module 155 calculates<br>
the associated check value of the bitmap representation as the application program 140<br>
decompresses the compressed format and generates the bitmap representation. As described<br>
above, the output filter module 155 can calculate the check value when the bitmap representation<br>
is complete, when a quadrant of the bitmap representation is complete, or when a line of the<br>
bitmap representation is complete. The server 110 stores the compressed format file and the<br>
associated check value attribute in the image store 160 and retrieves the compressed format file<br>
the first and any subsequent times the application program 140 generates the associated non-<br>
textual element.<br>
[0057] Whether, the server 110 stores the compressed format file and its associated check<br>
value attribute(s) in the image store 160 in a temporary portion (e.g., RAM memory buffer or<br>
cache) or a persistent portion (e.g., disk or non-volatile memory buffer) is based at least in part<br>
on design and hardware limitations (e.g., the size of the persistent storage). One exemplary<br>
criterion used to make that determination is the number of times the application program 140<br>
generates the non-textual element For example, if the application program 140 generates a<br>
particular non-textual element more than a predetermined number of times, the server 110 stores<br><br>
the compressed format file and its associated check value attribute(S) corresponding to that<br>
particular non-textual element persistently in the image store 160.<br>
[0058] In other embodiments, the server 110 stores the non-textual element if it is static or<br>
complex. For example, if the application program 140 always generates a splash screen at<br>
initialization, the server 110 stores the compressed format file corresponding to that splash<br>
screen in the persistent portion of the image store 160. In another embodiment, if the non-textual<br>
element is complex, static and/or generated repeatedly but does not have a corresponding<br>
compressed format file, the output filter module 155 generates a compressed format file for that<br>
non-textual element, in a standards-based or proprietary-based format. In any subsequent<br>
transmissions, the server agent 150 transmits the generated compressed format file in place of the<br>
bitmap representation. If the compressed format is a proprietary-based format, the server agent<br>
150 determines whether the client node 105 includes the applicable proprietary-based graphics<br>
library to decompress the compressed format file into a bitmap representation. If not included on<br>
the client node 105, the server agent 150 transmits the applicable library to the client node 105<br>
for installation.<br>
[0059] Although the illustrated embodiment depicts the image store 160 on the server node<br>
110, in an alternate embodiment, at least a portion of the image store (not shown) is on the client<br>
node 105. In this alternate embodiment, the output filter module 155 calculates the one or more<br>
check values of the bitmap representation and transmits the one or more check values to the<br>
server agent 150. The server agent 150 transmits these one or more check values to the client<br>
agent 175. The client agent 175 searches the portion of the image store on the client node 105<br>
for a compressed data format stored with an identical one or more check values attribute. The<br>
client agent 175 transmits the results of this search to the server agent' 150.<br>
[0060] If the compressed data format for the non-textual element exists on the client node<br>
105, the server agent 150 does not have to send either the compressed data format or the bitmap<br>
representation over the network 115. The server agent 150 only transmits the graphical display<br>
interface commands associated with the bitmap representation of the non-textual element. If the<br>
compressed data format for the non-textual element does not exist on the client node 105, the<br>
output filter module 155 obtains the corresponding compressed format of the non-textual<br>
element from the image store 160. The server agent 150 replaces the bitmap representation of<br>
the non-textual element with the non-textual element in the compressed data format that the<br>
output filter module 155 retrieved from the image store 160. The server agent 150 transmits the<br><br>
non-textual element in the compressed format, along with the graphical display interface<br>
commands associated with the bitmap representation, to the client node 105.<br>
[0061] FIG. 2 illustrates an exemplary embodiment of a process 200 to generate a display for<br>
a remote terminal session, using the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 1. The output filter module<br>
155 monitors the output of the application program 140 by monitoring calls made to the<br>
operating system of the server node 110. When the output filter module 155 detects (step 205) a<br>
display command from the application program 140, the output module 155 determines (step<br>
210) whether the application program 140 is generating a bitmap representation of a non-textual<br>
element.<br>
[0062] If the application program 140 is not generating a bitmap representation of a non-<br>
textual element, the output filter module 155 transmits (step 215) the display command to the<br>
server agent 150, which transmits that command, or a representative command defined in the<br>
protocol, to the client agent 175. If the application program 140 is generating a bitmap<br>
representation of a non-textual element, the output filter module 155 calculates (step 220) one or<br>
more check values corresponding to the bitmap representation of the non-textual image.<br>
[0063] Using the one or more calculated check value(s), the output filter module 155<br>
searches the image store 160 to determine (step 225) whether a compressed data format with<br>
identical check value attribute(s) exists. If there is a compressed data format in the image store<br>
160 with check value attribute(s) identical to the one or more check values the output filter<br>
module 155 calculates, the output module 155 replaces (step 230) the bitmap representation of<br>
the non-textual element with the compressed data format. The output module 155 transmits (step<br>
230) the compressed data format to the server agent 150 for eventual transmission to the client<br>
agent 175. The output module 155 also transmits all of the commands associated with the<br>
replaced bitmap representation along with the compressed data format.<br>
[0064]	If there is not a compressed data format with identical one or more check value<br>
attributes in the image store 160, the output module 155 determines (step 235) whether the<br>
bitmap representation of a non-textual element corresponding to the compressed data format<br>
meets a predetermined criterion for persistent storage (e.g., any of the criteria described above).<br>
If the output module 155 determines (step 235) that the predetermined criterion is met, the output<br>
module 155 stores (step 240) the compressed data format and the corresponding check value<br>
attribute, identical to the one or more calculated check values, in the persistent portion of the<br>
image store 160. If the output module 155 determines (step 235) that the predetermined criterion<br>
is not met, the output module 155 stores (step 245) the compressed data format and the<br><br>
corresponding check value attribute, identical to the one or more calculated check values, in the<br>
temporary portion of the image store 160.<br>
[0065] Once the output module 155 stores (step 240 or 245) the compressed data format and<br>
the corresponding check value attribute, identical to the one or more calculated check values, in<br>
the image store 160, the output module 155 replaces (step 230) the bitmap representation of the<br>
non-textual element with the compressed data format. The output module 155 transmits (step<br>
230) the compressed data format to the server agent 150 for eventual transmission to the client agent 175. The output module 155 continues monitoring the output generated by the application<br>
program 140 until the output module 155 detects (step 205) another display command from the<br>
application program 140.<br>
[0066] In another aspect, the invention pertains to methods, systems, and articles of<br>
manufacture for generating a media presentation. In one embodiment, a compressed data set,<br>
representing at least a portion of a media stream, is intercepted on a first computing device and<br>
transmitted, over a network, to a second computing device, where it is decompressed and<br>
presented to a user. In another embodiment, a decompressed data set, representing at least a<br>
portion of a media stream, is intercepted and compressed on the first computing device and then<br>
transmitted, as above, to the second computing device, where it is again decompressed and<br>
presented to the user.<br>
[0067] FIG. 3 illustrates one embodiment of a system 300 that generates a media<br>
presentation according to this aspect of the invention. The system 300 includes a first computing<br>
device, e.g., a server 310, in communication with a second computing device, e.g., a client 305,<br>
over a network 315. Generally speaking, except as set forth below, the client 305, the server<br>
310, and the network 315 have the same capabilities as the client 105, the server 110, and the<br>
network 115, respectively, described above.<br>
[0068] As shown, the client 305 includes at least a client transceiver 330, a client agent 375,<br>
and a presentation interface 345. The client agent 375 may be implemented as a software<br>
program and/or as a hardware device, such as, for example, an ASIC or an FPGA. The client<br>
agent 375 uses the client transceiver 330 to communicate over the network 315 and generates a<br>
presentation having media and non-media components at the presentation interface 345.<br>
[0069] In one embodiment, the server 310 is an application server. As illustrated, the server<br>
310 includes at least a server transceiver 335, an application program 340, a server agent 350, a<br>
first output filter module 355A, and a second output filter module 355B. The server agent 350,<br>
the first output filter module 355 A, and the second output filter module 355B may be<br><br>
implemented as a software program and/or as a hardware device, such as, for example, an ASIC<br>
or an FPGA. The server agent 350, the first output filter module 355A, and the second output<br>
filter module 355B use the server transceiver 335 to communicate over the network 315.<br>
[0070] In another embodiment, the aforementioned components 335, 340,350,355A, and<br>
355B are distributed over several servers in communication with each other over the network<br>
315, or over another network (not shown). Alternatively, in yet another embodiment, two or<br>
more of the aforementioned components 335,350, 355A, and 355B may be combined into a<br>
single component, such that the functions, as described below, performed by two or more of the<br>
components 335,350, 355A, and 355B are performed by the single component.<br>
[0071] The application program 340 illustrated in FIG. 3 is any application program 340 that<br>
renders, as part of its output, a media stream. The media stream may be a video stream, an audio<br>
stream, or, alternatively, a combination thereof. In addition, the application program 340 may<br>
output non-media graphical information. In this context, non-media graphical information refers<br>
generally to all graphical information outputted by the application program 340 without the use<br>
of a codec or the equivalent, such as, for example, static graphical information, including, but not<br>
limited to, toolbars and drop-down menus. Non-media graphical information also includes, for<br>
example, information for locating the static graphical information on a display screen. The<br>
application program 340 may be, for example, the MICROSOFT ENCARTA application<br>
program manufactured by the Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Washington.<br>
[0072] In one embodiment, the application program 340 uses external codecs, such as, for<br>
example, codecs installed in the operating system of the server 310, to decompress a compressed<br>
data set representing at least a portion of a media stream. In another embodiment, the codecs<br>
used by the application program 340 are embedded in the application program 340 itself. In yet<br>
another embodiment, the server 310 may include any number of executing application programs<br>
340, some of which use external codecs, others of which use embedded codecs.<br>
[0073] Where the application program 340 uses external codecs and desires to output a<br>
media stream, it requests that the operating system of the server 310 use the external codecs to<br>
decompress the compressed data set representing at least a portion of the media stream for<br>
subsequent display. Where the codecs used by the application program 340 are embedded in the<br>
application program 340 itself, the application program 340, when desiring to output a media<br>
stream, uses the embedded codecs to decompress the compressed data set itself for subsequent<br>
display. Additionally, the application program 340 may generate and transmit graphical display<br><br>
commands, associated with the non-media graphical information, to the operating system of the<br>
server 310.<br>
[0074] In accordance with the present invention, the application program 340 performs these<br>
tasks as if the application program 340 was going to generate a presentation having media and<br>
non-media components at the server 310. As explained below, the first output filter module<br>
355A, the second output filter module 355B, and the server agent 350 intercept the compressed<br>
data set being passed to the external codecs, the decompressed data set generated by the<br>
embedded codecs, and the graphical display commands associated with the non-media graphical<br>
information, respectively, and (after first compressing the decompressed data set generated by<br>
the embedded codecs) transmit them, over the network 315, to the client agent 375. The client<br>
agent 375, as explained below, then decompresses the received compressed data sets and issues<br>
the same or similar graphical display commands, associated with the non-media graphical<br>
information, to the operating system of the client 305 to generate .a presentation having media<br>
and non-media components at the presentation interface 345 of the client 305.<br>
[0075] The first output filter module 355A and the second output filter module 355B are<br>
invoked as an application program 340 using external codecs attempts to invoke an external<br>
codec to output a media stream. The first output filter module 355A intercepts an original<br>
compressed data set representing at least a portion of the media stream. Instead of<br>
decompressing the data set, as an external codec would, the first output filter module 355A<br>
transmits the original compressed data set Over the network 315 to the client agent 375. Where<br>
the media stream includes a video stream, the second output filter module 355B acting as an OS-<br>
level renderer captures information for locating images of the video stream on a display screen<br>
and transmits the information over the network 315 to the client agent 375.<br>
[0076] In another embodiment, when an application program 340 that uses embedded codecs<br>
attempts to invoke, for example, an OS-level Tenderer to output a media stream, the second<br>
output filter module 355B is invoked. The second output filter module 355B intercepts a first<br>
decompressed data set representing at least a portion of the media stream from the output of die<br>
application program 340. The second output filter module 355B then compresses, as explained<br>
below, the intercepted first decompressed data set and transmits the resulting compressed data<br>
set, over the network 315, to the client agent 375. The second output filter module 355B, as<br>
above, also captures, where the media stream includes a video stream, information for locating<br>
images of the video stream on a display screen and transmits the information over the network<br>
315 to the client agent 375.<br><br>
[0077] In another embodiment, the server agent 350 intercepts and transmits to the client<br>
agent 375, over the network 315, the graphical display commands associated with the non-media<br>
graphical information outputted by the application program 340.<br>
[0078] Additionally, in one embodiment, the first output filter module 355A, the second<br>
output filter module 355B or both (where the application program 340 uses external codecs), or<br>
the second output filter module 355B (where the application program 340 uses embedded<br>
codecs), captures timing information associated with the media stream and transmits the timing<br>
information, over the network 315, to the client agent 375. More specifically, the output filter<br>
module 355A, 355B captures, and transmits to the client agent 375, presentation times for each<br>
frame of the media stream, thereby enabling the client agent 375 to synchronize video and audio<br>
streams and to maintain the correct frame rate.<br>
[0079] As shown, the server agent 350 interfaces with the server transceiver 335 and the<br>
application program 340. In one embodiment, as explained below, the server agent 350 receives<br>
from the client agent 375, over the network 315, a list of media formats supported by the client<br>
agent 375. Upon receiving the list of supported media formats, the server agent 350 registers the<br>
output filter modules 355A, 355B by manipulating the configuration of the server 310. In one<br>
embodiment, for example, the server agent 350 registers the output filter modules 355A, 355B<br>
by editing the registry of the server 310. The server agent 350 then informs the client agent 375<br>
that the server 310 can handle all such media formats.<br>
[0080] At the client 305, the client agent 375 interfaces with the client transceiver 330 and<br>
the presentation interface 345. The client agent 375, as described below, initially informs the<br>
server agent 350 of the media formats supported by the client agent 375. The client agent 375<br>
also receives from the output filter modules 355A, 355B, over the network 315, the compressed<br>
data set and any associated timing information. Moreover, the client agent 375 receives over the<br>
network 315, from the second output filter module 355B, any information for locating images of<br>
a video stream on a display screen and, from the server agent 350, the graphical display<br>
commands associated with the non-media graphical information.<br>
[0081] The client agent 375, using either external or embedded codecs, decompresses the<br>
compressed data set and, together with the graphical display commands associated with the non-<br>
media graphical information, any information for locating images of a video stream on a display<br>
screen, and any timing information, generates a media presentation at the presentation interface<br>
345. The presentation interface 345 has, in one embodiment, a display screen that renders a<br>
graphical display, such as, for example, a video presentation. In another embodiment, the<br><br>
presentation interface 345 includes a speaker that renders an audio presentation. The client 305<br>
may include any number of presentation interfaces 345.<br>
[0082] The information provided in specifying the media formats supported by the client<br>
agent 375 may determine the mode of operation at the server 310. If the compressed data set is<br>
in a format that is not supported by the client agent 375, the second output filter module 355B<br>
may recompress the decompressed data set into a supported format.<br>
[0083] Referring now to FIGS. 4A, 4B, and 4C, one embodiment of a method 400 that<br>
generates a media presentation at the client 305, using the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 3, is<br>
illustrated. When the client 305 and the server 310 are both connected to the network 315, the<br>
client agent 375, at step 404, informs the server agent 350 of all the media formats supported by<br>
the client agent 375. In one embodiment, the list of supported media formats is created by<br>
enumerating the external codecs installed on the client 305. For example, the codecs installed in<br>
the operating system of the client 305 are enumerated by the client agent 375, over the network<br>
315, to the server agent 350. In another embodiment, the list of supported media formats is<br>
created by enumerating the codecs embedded in the client agent 375. For example, where the<br>
client agent 375 is implemented as a software program, the codecs embedded in the software<br>
program are enumerated by the client agent 375, over the network 315, to the server agent 350.<br>
Alternatively, the client agent 375 creates the list of supported media formats, and informs the<br>
server agent 350 of those supported media formats, by enumerating both the external codecs<br>
installed on the client 305 and the codecs embedded in the client agent 375.<br>
[0084] In one embodiment, the client agent 375 generates globally unique identifiers<br>
("GUIDs") and associates each GUID with a particular codec. The client agent 375 then<br>
transmits the list of generated GUIDs to the server agent 350 to inform the server agent 350 of<br>
the media formats supported by the client agent 375. In another embodiment, the client agent<br>
375 transmits a list of four character codes, each four character code being associated with a<br>
particular codec, to the server agent 350 to inform the server agent 350 of the media formats<br>
supported by the client agent 375.<br>
[0085] Upon receiving the list of supported media formats from the client agent 375, the<br>
server agent 350 registers, at step 408, the first output filter module 355A and/or the second<br>
output filter module 355B on the server 310, as associated with the supported media formats.<br>
The server agent 350, at step 412, then reports back to the client agent 375 that the server 310<br>
can handle all of the enumerated media formats.<br><br>
[0086] At step 416, an application program 340 starts executing on the server 310. When the<br>
application program 340 identifies within its output, at step 420, the presence of media content,<br>
such as, for example, a media stream, the first output filter module 355A, the second output filter<br>
module 355B, or both are invoked. If, at step 424, the application program 340 uses external<br>
codecs, both the first output filter module 355A and the second output filter module 355B are<br>
invoked at step 428 as the application program 340 attempts to invoke an external codec. The<br>
first output filter module 355 A then intercepts, at step 432, an original compressed data set<br>
representing at least a portion of the media stream and transmits, at step 436, the original<br>
compressed data set to the client agent 375, without decompressing the data set. The client agent<br>
375, at step 440, receives the original compressed data set and decompresses, at step 444, the<br>
original compressed data set to generate a decompressed data set. The client agent 375 uses<br>
either external codecs installed on the client 305 or codecs embedded in the client agent 375<br>
itself to decompress the original compressed data set.<br>
[0087] If, instead, at step 424, the application program 340 uses codecs embedded in the<br>
application program 340 itself, the second output filter module 355B is, at step 448, invoked as<br>
the application program 340 attempts to invoke an OS-level Tenderer to display the<br>
decompressed data set. The second output filter module 355B then intercepts, at step 452, a first<br>
decompressed data set, representing at least a portion of the media stream, from the output of the<br>
application program 340 and compresses, at step 456, the intercepted first decompressed data set.<br>
A variety of compression techniques, including both lossy compression techniques and lossless<br>
compression techniques, may be used by the second output filter module 355B, at step 456, to<br>
compress the media stream.<br>
[0088] Where the media stream is a video stream, the intercepted first decompressed data set<br>
may be compressed, at step 456, by the second output filter module 355B using, for example, a<br>
lightweight lossy video encoding algorithm, such as, for example, MJPEG compression. In<br>
using-the lightweight lossy video encoding algorithm, the second output filter module 355B may<br>
choose the desired compression ratio or it may use a predetermined compression ratio. The<br>
degree of quality loss chosen by the second output filter module 355B will, typically, depend on<br>
the available bandwidth of the network connection. For example, where a user of the client 305<br>
uses a slow modem to connect to the network 315, the second output filter module 355B may<br>
choose to use low quality video. Where, on the other hand, a user of the client 305 uses a LAN<br>
link or a broadband connection to connect to the network 315, the second output filter module<br>
355B may choose to use a higher quality video.<br><br>
[0089] Following compression of the intercepted first decompressed data set at step 456, the<br>
second output filter module 355B transmits, at step 460, the compressed data set to the client<br>
agent 375 in place of the first decompressed data set. The client agent 375, at step 464, receives<br>
the compressed data set and decompresses, at step 468, the compressed data set to generate a<br>
second decompressed data set. Again, the client agent 375 uses either external codecs installed<br>
on the client 305 or codecs embedded in the client agent 375 itself to decompress the compressed<br>
data set.<br>
[0090] Regardless of whether the application program 340 uses external or embedded<br>
codecs, where the media stream, at step 470, includes a video stream, the second output filter<br>
module 355B, at step 472, captures information for locating images of the video stream on a<br>
display screen and transmits the captured information over the network 315 to the client agent<br>
375. The client agent 375, at step 474, receives the information for locating the images of the<br>
video stream on the display screen.<br>
'<br>
[0091] Regardless, again, of whether the application program 340 uses external or embedded<br>
codecs and regardless, moreover, of whether the media stream, at step 470, includes a video<br>
stream, the server agent 350, at step 476, intercepts and transmits, over the network 315,<br>
graphical display commands, associated with the non-media graphical information outputted by<br>
the application program 340, to the client agent 375. The client agent 375, at step 480, receives<br>
the graphical display commands associated with the non-media graphical information.<br>
[0092] Where, at step 484, the output filter module 355A, 355B captures timing information<br>
associated with the media stream, the output filter module 355A, 355B transmits, at step 488, the<br>
timing information to the client agent 375. The client agent 375 receives, at step 492, the timing<br>
information and generates, at step 496, the media presentation at the presentation interface 345.<br>
To generate the media presentation at the presentation interface 345, the client agent 375 uses the<br>
timing information, the graphical display commands associated with the non-media graphical<br>
information, and, where the media stream includes a video stream, the information for locating<br>
the images of the video stream on a display screen to seamlessly combine the decompressed data<br>
set (or, more specifically, where the application program 340 uses embedded codecs, the second<br>
decompressed data set) with the non-media graphical information.<br>
[0093] Where the output filter module 355A, 355B does not capture timing information<br>
associated with the media stream, the client agent 375 generates, at step 496, the media<br>
presentation at the presentation interface 345 using only the decompressed data set (or, more<br>
specifically, where the application program 340 uses embedded codecs, the second<br><br>
decompressed data set), the graphical display commands associated with the non-media<br>
graphical information, and, where the media stream includes a video stream, the information for<br>
locating the images of the video stream on a display screen.<br>
