Description<br>
Method and design for transmission of data.<br>
The Invention relates to a method for transmission of data, as well as to a lay out for implementation of the method.  The expression "data" relates itself within the framework of this application for patent also to language data.  The expression,"transmission" comprises the procedures during sending and receiving.<br>
Many mobile wireless systems; as, for example, the non-European mobile wireless system GSM use a combination of the multiple access method frequency multiplex (Frequency Division Multiple Access-FDMA) and time multiplex (Time Division Multiple Access -TDMA), where, in each case a frequency channel within the framework of 8 time-slots is apportioned and during the different time-slots useful or control data are transmitted by, as a rule, different participants (subscribers).  Usually, especially during telephone operation for sending and for receiving in each case a timeslot of a framework are assigned to a connection.<br>
Especially one can differentiate between the procedure of the sending, receiving and of the adjacent-cell-obseration, which usually, in each case, are implemented in different timeslote. Thereby it is possible to use a commnon antenna for sending and receiving, which according to the timeslot is connected with a reversing-switch-with-the sending or receiving aerial.<br>
Monitoring of neighbouring cells signifies, that within a wireless network (cellular network) consisting of several cells of the communication transmitting device (especially mobile station) during an existing connection not only the receiving quality of<br><br>
-2-<br>
the wireless signal of the basic station instantaneously allocated to the linkare, but also the receiving qualities of the wireless signals of the basic station of the neighbouring cells are determined (neighbouring cells observation).<br>
If it is found thst the receiving quality of the wireless signals of the basic station of a neighbouring cell is better that the basic station instantaneously allocated to the linkage, then the connection as a rule, is changed-over (handed over) to this basic station.  Since these procedures of the reception and of  the neighbouring cell monitoring takes place, as a rule, in different timeslots, the two procedures can be implemented in a simple manner with a receiving aerial and especially with an oscillator rather synthesiser, although these take place in different frequency ranges (neighbouring cells use for reasons of interference usually different frequencies).<br>
Now in order to transmit the higher bit rates basing on such a system it is possible to assign several timeslots to a connection for sending and/or receiving.  This can, however, lead thereto tn case of very high bit rates, that the communication transmitting device in all either sends or receives 8 timeslots.  Thereby no neighbouring cell monitoring can be conducted any more, since these can take place only in timeslots, in which it is neither sent nor received.<br>
If the bit rate is further raised, then it is even necessary, to send and to, receive  simultaneously and also to implement the neighbouring cell monitoring.  Also this is not possible with the uptil now known methods and arrangements.<br><br>
-3-<br>
The Invention therefore has the task as the basis, to indicate a method and an arrangement for implementation of the method, with which it is possible in cellular networks, in which a neighbouring cell monitoring is implemented. to transmit with lowest-possible expense the high bit rates.<br>
This task is accomplished with the ehlp of a method with features according to claim no. 1.  There for sending and receiving of data in cellular wireless network, in which by the communication transmission device usually a neighbouring cell monitoring is implemented, which processes the wireless signals (FA) of the<br>
basic station instantaneously allocated to the linkage (BSA) through a receiving aerial (EA) of a communication transmission device (KE), and processes the wireless signals (FB) of the basic station (BSB) of the neighbouring cells at the least within a given time through another receiving aerial (EB) of the communication transmitting device (KE).<br>
The Invention is based upon accordingly thoughts, to process the wireless signals (FD) from the basic stations (BSB) of the adjacent cells (NZ) through a second receiving aerial provided with for this purpose (EB) and, in fact, at the least then, when on the ground of too high bit rates the wireless signals (FB) from the basic station (BSB) of the neighbouring cells cannot be processed<br>
any more through the receiving aerial (EA).<br>
According to the realisation of the receiving aerial (EA, EB) and of the subsequent signal processing  parts (SV, SVD) by an expert, the receiving aerial there can have different structural components.  In each case the processing within the both of the receiving aerials (EA, EB) bases on an-own oscillator (VCO1, VCO2).<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
It Is achieved through the Invention, that the wireless signals (FB) from the basic station (BSB) of the neighoouring cells (neighbouring cells monitoring) during (also during the same time-slots) the reception of the wireless signal (FA) of the basic station (BSA) instantaneously assigned to the linkage is possible,<br>
although the wireless signals lie in another frequency range as the wireless signals (FB).<br>
In case of a preferred form of execution of the Invention the sending and receiving signals of the communication transmission device are transmitted through a common antenna (A1) and are separated from one another through a sending and receiving switch connected in series to the antenna (A1),<br>
Through the use of a sending/receiving switch (SE) it is achieved, that according to the frequency range of the signals an inlet selection is implemented and thereby simultaneously can be sent -and received through an antenna (A1), without influencing the sending signals through the receiving signals and vice versa.<br>
A preferred form of execution provides, that in time-spans, in<br>
which no neighbouring cell monitoring is conducted, the wireless signals (FA) can be received by the basic station (BSA) Instantaneously assigned to the connection besides the antenna (A1) also through the additional antenna (A2) and therefore be processed besides the receiving aerial (EA) also the receiving aerial (EB) be and a further signal processing is conducted on the basis of an as such known antenna diversity method.<br>
Thereby a substantial improvement in the detection of the received data can be achieved, thet means, the bit error rate can be<br>
substantially reduced at similar conditions through the antenna<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
diversity method.<br>
Through introduction of the Invention in the system concent of existing cellular mobile wireless network as the GSK, it is possible through little modification of the transmission protocol on the basis of the existing structure to render possible the transmission of higher bit rates.<br>
Further developments-of the Invention follows from the sub claims. Arrangements for the implementation of the method are indicated in the claims 4 to 6.<br>
For elucidation of the posing of the problem underlying the Invention and for clarification, of the forms of execution of the Invention help the/accompanyese figures listed-on in the following.<br>
It show :<br>
Fig. 1  a schematic representation of the outfield (surrounding), in which the method in accordance with the Invention can be conducted.<br>
Fig. 2  a schematic representation of a communication transmission device in accordance with the Invention.<br>
Fig. 3 a schematic representation of a variation of execution of a communication transmission device in accordance with the Invention.<br>
The Invention is described in details In the following with the help of the preferred example of execution and with the help of the figures.<br>
As it is "to recognise In the figures 1 and 2, the wireless signals (FA) of the basic station (BSA) instantaneously assigned to the<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
linkage are processed through a receiving aerial (EA) of a communication transmission device (KE), rand the wireless signals (PB) from the basic station (BSB) of the neighbouring cells (Nz)<br>
through another receiving aerial (SB) of the communication transmission device (KE).  According to the realisation of the<br>
communication transmission device (KE) in the receiving aerials<br>
component<br>
(EA, EB) and in the signal processing/       (SV) different structural component (assembles)  are contained.  In each case the frequency range in in each case the frequency ranges, In which both the different receiving aerials (EA, EB) are operated with the help of two different voltage controlled oscillators (VGO1, VCO2) are realised.<br>
The sending and receiving signals of the communication transmission device are transmitted through a common antenna (A1) and are separated from one another through a sending/receiving switch coupled at the outlet side to the antenna (A1) with the help of, an inlet selection (ES).  The sending and receiving switch (SE) obstructed through filter, that eventually simultaneously transmitted sending and receiving signals disturb each other too much.<br>
Another execution-variant of the method in accordance with the Invention provides, that as is shown in figure no, 3, in the" periods, in which no neighbouring cells monitoring is conducted, the wireless signals (FA) received from the basic station allocated instanteneously to the linkage received through an additional antenna (A2) and according to an inlet selection (ES) are switched-on through a reverse switch in such a manner to the receiving aerial (EB), that these can be processed further through this receiving aerial (EB).  On top of it, a further signal processing can be implemented on the basis of the antenna diversity<br><br>
7<br>
method. There are the multiple reception of the wireless signals (FA) through (he antennas (A1, A2) is used, in order to detect the signals with a lower rate of errors,<br>
A communication transmission device (KE) in accordance with the invention for implementation of the method is provided with an antenna (Al), a sending out aerial (S)/ a receiving aerial (EA) for processing of the wireless signals (FA) of the basic station (BSA) instantaneously assigned to the linkage, a second receiving aerial (EB) for processing of the wireless signals (FB) of the basic stations (BSB) of the adjacent cells and a signal processing part (SV). The different frequencies, in which both the receiving aerials (EA, EB) are operated,, are thereby realised with the help of two different voltage-controlled oscillators (VC01,VC02).<br>
An advantageous form of execution of the communication transmission gadget is represented in Figure No. 2 schematically and possesses, besides that, a sending out/receiving switch (SE) for separation of the sending-out and receiving signals of the communication transmission gadget (KE) with the help of an inlet selection (ES).<br>
