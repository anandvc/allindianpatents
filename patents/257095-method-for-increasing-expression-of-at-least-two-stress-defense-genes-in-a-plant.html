Method for increasing expression of stress defense genes<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a method of increasing<br>
expression amounts of stress defense genes involved in stress<br>
tolerance or stress resistance in plants, and a method of<br>
imparting various stress defense effects by increasing the<br>
expression amounts of the stress defense genes involved in the<br>
stress tolerance or the stress resistance.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Plants adapt to various types of environmental stress such<br>
as the temperature and salt of their habitats. However, in terms<br>
of temperature stress, for example, plants are susceptible to hot<br>
or cold temperatures when exposed to environments over or under<br>
the maximum or minimum optimum growth temperature, leading to<br>
impairment upon the gradual or sudden loss of the physiological<br>
functions of cells. Elf forts have been made to expand the<br>
temperature adaptability of plants by breeding means such as<br>
selection or cross breeding in order to make use of wild plants<br>
adapted to various temperature environments for food crops,<br>
horticultural plants, and the like. The planting period in which<br>
vegetables, flowers and ornamental plants, fruit trees, and the<br>
like can be cultivated has been expanded by such breeding means<br>
as well as by protected horticulture. However, Japan in<br>
particular extends a considerable length to the north and south,<br>
with extreme variation in climate and considerable change in<br>
seasons from area to area, resulting in a greater risk of crop<br>
exposure to temperature environments that are not conducive to<br>
growth, depending on the area and season. Rice, for example,<br>
which originates in tropical regions, can now be cultivated in<br>
cooler areas such as the Tohoku district and Hokkaido as a result<br>
of improvements in varieties since the Meiji period, and are now<br>
cultivated as staples of these regions, but unseasonably low<br>
temperatures in early summer in these areas recently have<br>
resulted in cold-weather damage, leading to the problem of severe<br>
shortages even now. Recently, abnormal atmospheric phenomena<br>
attributed to global warming or El Nino have resulted in major<br>
crop damage, and the rice shortages caused by severe cold-weather<br>
damage in 1993 are still remembered. Culinary plants include many<br>
crops of tropical origin among fruits and vegetables such as<br>
tomatoes, cucumbers, melons, and water melon. Such crops are in<br>
high demand and are extremely important in terms of agriculture,<br>
and they have long been involved in greenhouse culture. However,<br>
since the oil shock of 1974, the conservation of resources and<br>
lowering warming costs have become a problem. The conservation of<br>
resources in protected horticulture has been studied from a<br>
variety of perspectives, from the structural concerns of green<br>
houses to cultivation techniques, but the most basic<br>
consideration is increasing the cold tolerance of crops.<br>
Hot; temperature can be a major form of stress for plants,<br>
and, in particular, the growth and yield of crops is tremendously<br>
affected by heat during summer.<br>
In regard to salt stress, it is said that about 10% of all<br>
land surface area is salt damaged, and the spread of saline soil,<br>
primarily in arid areas such as Southeast Asia and Africa is<br>
becoming a serious agricultural problem.<br>
Drought stress can be a major form of stress for plants, and<br>
is significantly affected by the amount and distribution of<br>
precipitation when temperature is not a limiting factor. The<br>
growth and yield of crops is tremendously dependent upon drought<br>
stress Ln semi-arid regions and the like which are important<br>
areas of crop cultivation.<br>
Osmotic stress or water stress can be a major form of stress<br>
for plants, arid is significantly affected by the amount and<br>
distribution of precipitation when temperature is not a limiting<br>
factor. The growth and yield of crops is tremendously dependent<br>
upon osmotic: stress or water stress in semi-arid regions and the<br>
like which are important areas of crop cultivation.<br>
Cross breeding, breeding making use of recent genetic<br>
engineering techniques, methods making use of the action of plant<br>
hormones and plant regulators, and the like have been employed to<br>
improve tolerance against these various types of stress.<br>
Stress-tolerant plants have thus far been produced using<br>
genetic engineering techniques. Genes reported to have been used<br>
in the improvement of cold tolerance include fatty acid<br>
desaturase genes of membrane lipids (co-3 desaturase gene,<br>
glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase gene, and stearoyl-ACPdesaturase<br>
gene), pyruvic-phosphate dikinase genes involved in<br>
photosynthesis, and genes coding for proteins with<br>
cryoprotection/preverition activity (COR15, COR85, and kinl) .<br>
Genes reported to have been used in the improvement of<br>
tolerance against salt, drought, and water stress include glycine<br>
betaine synthetase genes of osmotic regulators (choline<br>
monooxygenase gene and betaine aldehyde hydrogenase gene) and<br>
proline synthetase genes (l-pyroline-5-carboxylate synthetase).<br>
As the method of improving the stress tolerance by<br>
increasing the expression amount of the stress defense gene<br>
involved in the stress tolerance or the stress resistance, the<br>
method of utilizing a gene encoding a transcription factor (DREB<br>
gene) has been reported (Non-patent document 1: Nature<br>
Biotechnology, 17, 287-291, 1999; Patent document 2: The Plant<br>
Cell, 10, 1391-1406, 1998) . In both reports, it has been<br>
described that the expression amount of the stress defense gene<br>
group such as rd29A, kinl and P5CS are increased to enhance the<br>
tolerance against drought stress, salt stress and freeze stress<br>
by excessively expressing the DREB gene constantly in plants, but<br>
remarkable inhibition of growth is observed, individuals which<br>
stop the growth and development and are withered are observed,<br>
and adverse effects on the growth and development are shown.<br>
There are the cases in which the gene involved in the<br>
stress tolerance or the stress resistance other than DREB gene<br>
has been introduced. It has been known that a cold regulated<br>
protein/LEA protein is a late embryogenesis abundant (LEA)<br>
protein and is induced by stress, and it has been reported that<br>
the tolerance against drought stress and salt stress is enhanced<br>
by introducing HV1 which is the LEA protein into rice plant<br>
(Plant Physiology, 110, 249-257, 1996). It has been reported that<br>
a pathogen related PR-1 protein is a protein induced by pathogen<br>
infection and that the tolerance against heavy metal stress and<br>
pathogen infection stress is enhanced by introducing a CABPR1<br>
gene which is one of PR-1 (pathogenesis-related protein I) into<br>
tobacco (Plant; Cell Rep., Feb 18, 2005). Peroxidase is known to<br>
be one (EC 1.11.1.7) of cell wall enzymes in the plants and to be<br>
induced by disease and stress. It has been reported that the<br>
tolerance against oxidative stress and pest stress is enhanced by<br>
introducing it into the plants(Plant Physiology, 132, 1177-1185,<br>
2003; J. Econ. Entomol., 95(1), 81-88, 2002). However, for these<br>
stress tolerance and stress resistance, at most only two types of<br>
stress tolerances are imparted by introducing one type of the<br>
gene involved in the stress tolerance and the stress resistance<br>
into the plant. In the natural world, the plants suffer multiple<br>
stresses simultaneously, and thus, it is necessary to impart<br>
defense effects on the multiple stresses simultaneously in order<br>
to increase productivity of crops. Also, in many of the plants<br>
transformed with the forgoing genes, actually the sufficient<br>
effect to an industrially applicable extent has not been obtained,<br>
and actually these plants have not come into practical use.<br>
There are genes suggested to be deeply involved in stress<br>
although they have not been introduced into the plant. It has<br>
been reported that an old regulated protein/corlS is a gene<br>
induced by low temperature stress and is deeply involved in<br>
freeze stress tolerance (Pro. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 93, 13404-<br>
13409, 1996; Pro. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 95, 14570-14575, 1998).<br>
It. has been reported that an early response dehydration<br>
prote.in/ERD15 is a gene induced by drought stress and is deeply<br>
involved in drought stress tolerance (Plant Physiology, 106, 1707,<br>
1994). It has been reported that a salt stress induced tonoplast<br>
intrinsic protein/aquaporin and a water channel protein/aquaporin<br>
of Gene Number 7 are water channel proteins induced by stress,<br>
and are deeply involved in the tolerance against salt stress,<br>
osmotic stress and low temperature stress (Mol. Cells., 9(1), 84-<br>
90, L999; Foods Food Ingredients J. Jpn., 176, 40-45). It has<br>
been reported that a dehydration induced protein/RD22 is a<br>
protein induced by drought stress, and is deeply involved in<br>
drought: stress tolerance (Plant Cell., 15(1), 63-78, 2003). It<br>
has been reported that a senescence associated protein senl is a<br>
protein induced by aging stress, salt stress, osmotic stress and<br>
low temperature stress, and is deeply involved in the tolerance<br>
against aging stress, salt stress, osmotic stress and low<br>
temperature stress (Plant Physiology, 130, 2129-2141, 2002).<br>
Additionally, there are genes shown to be involved in the stress<br>
tolerance and the stress resistance. If these genes are<br>
introduced into the plant, the stress resistance corresponding to<br>
each gene is enhanced, but it is difficult to increase the<br>
expression amounts of the multiple stress defense genes<br>
simultaneously.<br>
Owing to environmental problems and food problems, it is a<br>
very important subject to impart the stress defense effects to<br>
the plants, and several attempts to improve the stress defense<br>
have been performed by gene recombination technology, but<br>
actually the sufficient effect to an industrially applicable<br>
extent has not been obtained, and actually no plants has come<br>
into practical use. Furthermore, the expression levels of the<br>
stress defense gene group have been increased to improve the<br>
stress tolerance by excessively expressing the gene encoding DREB<br>
which is one of transcription factors in the plants. However, the<br>
remarkable inhibitory effect on the growth and development is<br>
observed, and it is problematic in that seeds can not be<br>
collected. Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to<br>
provide a method of imparting various stress defense effects by<br>
simply increasing expression amounts of multiple stress defense<br>
genes w.i thin the range in which no adverse effect is given to the<br>
growth and development of plants before and/or during<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
As a result of an extensive study for accomplishing the<br>
above object, the present inventors have found that a polyamine<br>
amount before and during encountering stress is increased by<br>
isolating a spermidine synthase (SPDS) gene, introducing the gene<br>
into a plant and excessively expressing the gene under promoter<br>
control, thereby increasing expression levels of multiple genes<br>
involved in stresses and improving parameters for various stress<br>
tolerances within the range in which no adverse effect is given<br>
to the growth and development of plants. Furthermore, the present<br>
inventors have found that various stress tolerance parameters are<br>
improved by similarly increasing the expression levels of the<br>
multiple genes involved in stresses to impart the stress defense<br>
effects using not only the spermidine synthase (SPDS) gene but<br>
also an S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (SAMDC) gene, an<br>
arginine decarboxylase (ADC) gene, an ornithine decarboxylase<br>
(ODC) gene and a spermine synthase (SPMS) gene capable of<br>
controlling an amount of contained spermidine or spermine. In<br>
addition, the present inventors have found that it can be<br>
important to excessively express in a form containing 5'-nontranslated<br>
region concerning the ADC gene, the ODC gene and the<br>
SAMDC gene having 5'-non-translated region (e.g., uORF: small<br>
upstream open reading frame) which has been described to control<br>
an expression amount and a translation amount. That is, the<br>
present invention relates to imparting the stress defense effects<br>
to the plants.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
As used in the present invention, "stress" refers to stress<br>
received from the environment, such as high temperatures, low<br>
temperatures, low pH, low oxygen, oxidation, osmotic pressure,<br>
drought, water, weak light, cadmium, ozone, air pollution, UV<br>
rays, pathogens, salt, herbicides, intense light, flooding, aging,<br>
heavy metals and pests. As used in the present invention, "nontrans<br>
formants" or "untransformed plants" mean any plants to which<br>
at least one gene selected from exogenous spermidine synthase<br>
(SPDS) genes, S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (SAMDC) genes,<br>
arginine decarboxylase (ADC) genes, ornithine decarboxylase (ODC)<br>
genes and spermine synthase (SPMS) genes has not been introduced.<br>
As such, wild species, as well as cultivated varieties<br>
established through common cross breeding, natural or artificial<br>
variants thereof, transgenic plants incorporating exogenous genes<br>
other than sperrnidine synthase genes, and the like are all<br>
included. Documents cited in this specification are incorporated<br>
herein by reference.<br>
Polyamine synthase gene<br>
In the present invention, unexpectedly it has been found<br>
that the expression amounts of multiple genes (stress defense<br>
genes) involved in stress defense are increased by introducing a<br>
polyamine synthase gene into the plant. Furthermore, the present<br>
inventors have found the method in which the expression amounts<br>
of the multiple stress defense genes are increased within the<br>
range in which no adverse effect is given to the growth and<br>
development of the plants to impart various stress defense<br>
effects by transforming the plants particularly with the<br>
polyamine synthase gene such as spermidine synthase (SPDS) gene,<br>
S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (SAMDC) gene, arginine<br>
decarboxylase (ADC) gene, ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) gene and<br>
spermine synthase (SPMS) gene capable of increasing the amount of<br>
contained spermidine or spermine among the polyamine synthase<br>
genes. Herein, the SPDS gene, the SAMDC gene, the ADC gene, the<br>
ODC gene and the SPMS gene are sometimes collectively referred to<br>
as the "polyamine synthase gene". Therefore, the "polyamine<br>
synthase gene" includes the SAMDC gene, the ADC gene, the ODC<br>
gene and the SPMS gene.<br>
As used in the present invention, "spermidine synthase"<br>
(SPDS) genes" are genes cording for amino acids of enzymes<br>
involved in spermidine or spermine biosynthesis. The SPDS is a<br>
rate-.limi.ting enzyme which produces spermidine. Spermidine<br>
synthase: (SPDS: EC2.5.1.16) is an enzyme catalyzing the reaction<br>
producing sperrnidine and methylthioadenosine from putrescine and<br>
adenosy]methylthiopropylamine. "Arginine decarboxylase (ADC)<br>
genes" are genes coding for amino acids of enzymes involved in<br>
spermidine or spermine biosynthesis. The ADC is a rate-limiting<br>
enzyme which produces spermidine. Arginine decarboxylase (ADC:<br>
EC4.1.1. 19.) is an enzyme catalyzing the reaction producing<br>
agrnatine and carbon dioxide from L-arginine.<br>
"S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (SAMDC) genes" are genes<br>
coding tor amino acids of enzymes involved in spermidine or<br>
spermine biosynthesis. S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (SAMDC:<br>
EC4.1.1.50.) is an enzyme catalyzing the reaction producing<br>
adenosylmethylthiopropylamine and carbon dioxide from<br>
S-adenosylmethionine. "Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) genes" are<br>
genes coding for amino acids of enzymes involved in spermidine or<br>
spermine biosynthesis. Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC: EC4.1.1.17.)<br>
is an enzyme catalyzing the reaction producing putrescine and<br>
carbon dioxide from L-ornithine. "Spermine synthase (SPMS) genes"<br>
are genes coding for amino acids of enzymes involved in spermine<br>
biosynthesis. The SPMS is a rate-limiting enzyme which produces<br>
spermidine. For carrying out the present invention, the most<br>
preferable "polyamine synthase genes" are SPDS genes.<br>
These polyamine synthase genes may be derived from any,<br>
such as plants, microbes and animals, as long as the gene<br>
expression for stress defense is enhanced without causing adverse<br>
effects on growth. Genes which are already isolated can also be<br>
used. For example, spermidine synthase (SPDS) genes have been<br>
isolated from plants such as Arabidopsis thaliana and tabacco<br>
(Plant Cell Physiol., 39(1), 73-79, (1998)), tomatoes (Plant<br>
Physiol., 120, 935, (1999)), coffee (Plant Science., 140, 161-168,<br>
(1999)), peas (Plant Molecular Biology, 39, 933-943, (1999)),<br>
apples (Mol. Gen. Genomics, 268, 799-807, (2003)), Cucurbita<br>
ficifclA.a Bouche (W002/23974, W003/84314) . Furthermore, it has<br>
been attempted that the spermidine synthase (SPDS) gene is<br>
introduced into tobacco which is a model plant, and the change of<br>
contained polyamine has been examined, but the expression level<br>
of the stress defense genes and the improvement of environmental<br>
stress tolerances have not been examined (Journal of Plant<br>
Physiology, 162: 989-1001, 2004). Arginine decarboxylase (ADC)<br>
genes have been isolated from oats (Mol. Gen. Genet., 224, 431-<br>
436 (1990)), tomatoes (Plant Physiol., 103, 829-834 (1993)),<br>
Arabidopsis thaliana (Plant Physiol., Ill, 1077-1083 (1996)),<br>
peas (Plant Mol. Biol., 28, 997-1009 (1995)), and Cucurbita<br>
ficifolia Bouche (W002/23974, W003/84314); S-adenosylmethionine<br>
decarboxylase (SAMDC) genes have been isolated from potatoes<br>
(Plant Hoi. Biol., 26, 327-338 (1994)), spinach (Plant Physiol.,<br>
107, 1461-1462 (1995)), and Cucurbita ficifolia Bouche<br>
(W002/23974, W003/84314); ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) genes<br>
have been isolated from datura (Biochem. J., 314, 241-248<br>
(1996)); spermine synthase (SPMS) genes have been isolated from<br>
Arabidopsis thaliana (EMBO J., 19, 4248-4256, (2000))<br>
In one preferable embodiment of the present invention, it<br>
is important that the ADC gene, the ODC gene or the SAMDC gene is<br>
excessively expressed in a form of containing the 5'-nontranslated<br>
region (e.g., uORF) which affects the expression and<br>
the translation under the control of an inducible type promoter.<br>
The "uORF" of the present invention indicates an upstream<br>
open reading frame, and is present 5' upstream (5'-non-translated<br>
region) of the ORF which encodes amino acids. The uORF is present<br>
in the 5'-non-translated region of the polyamine synthase genes<br>
(ADC gene, ODC gene and SAMDC gene), and is believed to control<br>
the expression arid the translation of the polyamine synthase<br>
genes.<br>
According to the present invention, the polyamine synthase<br>
gene isolated from microorganisms and animals can express the<br>
stress defense genes such as DREB, CBF1, LEA and COR about 1.1 to<br>
10 times, preferably about 1.3 to 10 times, more preferably about<br>
1.4 to 8 times and particularly about 1.5 to 5 times more highly<br>
compared with non-transformants. More preferably, the polyamine<br>
synthase gene isolated from the microorganisms and the animals<br>
can express the stress defense genes such as DREB, CBF1, LEA and<br>
COR in the range of about 1.5 to 4 times more highly compared<br>
with the non-transformants.<br>
In addition, polyamine synthase genes can also be isolated<br>
from various plants. Specific examples include dicotyledons such<br>
as Cucurbitaceae; Solanaceae; Brassicaceae such as Arabidopsis<br>
thaliand; Papilionaceae such as alfalfa and Vigna unguiculata;<br>
Malvaceae; and Asteraceae; or monocotyledons such as Gramineae,<br>
including rice, wheat, barley, and corn. Cucurbitaceae,<br>
Brassicaceae and Gramineae are preferred, and Cucurbita ficifolia<br>
Bouche, Arabidopsis thaliana, rice, corn, wheat, cotton, soybeans<br>
and rapeseed are more preferred.<br>
In the invention, the most suitable conditions for<br>
obtaining polyamine synthase genes are also found. That is, plant<br>
tissue in which the plant-derived polyamine synthase genes of the<br>
invention are isolated may be in the form of seeds or in the<br>
process of growing. The genes may be isolated from part or all of<br>
the tissue of growing plants. Any part can be used to isolate<br>
genes, but whole plants, buds, flowers, ovaries, fruit, leaves,<br>
stems, roots, and the like are preferred. Roots and leaves are<br>
more preferred.<br>
Preferred examples of polyamine metabolism-related enzyme<br>
genes used in the present invention include the spermidine<br>
synthase gene. Specific examples include:<br>
* DNA having the base sequence represented by base numbers 77<br>
through 1060 in the base sequence given in SEQ ID NO. I<br>
(Cucurbita ficifolia Bouche);<br>
* DNA having the base sequence represented by base numbers 118<br>
through 1281 in the base sequence given in SEQ ID NO. 3 (rice) ;<br>
and<br>
* DNA having the base sequence represented by base numbers 456<br>
through 1547 in the base sequence given in SEQ ID NO. 5 (Cucurbita<br>
ficifoUa Bouche) .<br>
* DNA having the base sequence represented by base numbers 541<br>
through 2661 in the base sequence given in SEQ ID NO. 7 (Cucurbita<br>
ficifolia Bouche) .<br>
* DNA having the base sequence represented by base numbers 1<br>
through 1020 in the base sequence given in SEQ ID NO. 9<br>
 (Arabidopsis thaliana) .<br>
Further examples include:<br>
* DNA having a base sequence capable of hybridizing under<br>
stringent conditions with DNA or their complementary chains<br>
having any of the above sequences, and coding for a polypeptide<br>
with spermidine synthase activity equivalent to those sequences.<br>
Still further examples include:<br>
* DNA comprising any of the above amino acid sequences with 1 or<br>
more bases deleted, substituted, inserted, or added, and coding<br>
for a polypeptide with spermidine synthase activity equivalent to<br>
those sequences.<br>
"Polyamine synthase genes" include known genes as well as<br>
DNA having a base sequence capable of hybridizing under stringent<br>
conditions with the genes or their complementary chains, and<br>
coding for a polypeptide with polyamine synthase activity<br>
equivalent to those sequences. Furthermore, DNA comprising amino<br>
acid sequences encoded by any of the above DNA, in which 1 or<br>
more bases deleted, substituted, inserted, or added, and coding<br>
for a polypeptide with polyamine synthase activity equivalent to<br>
those sequences are included.<br>
The "stringent conditions" referred to here mean conditions<br>
under which base sequences coding for a polypeptide with enzyme<br>
activity equivalent to the polyamine synthase (e.g. spermidine<br>
synthase) encoded by a specific polyamine synthase gene (e.g.<br>
polyamine) synthase genes) sequence form hybrids with the specific<br>
sequence (referred to as specific hybrids), and base sequences<br>
coding for polypeptides with no such equivalent activity do not<br>
form hybrids with the specific sequence (referred to as nonspecific<br>
hybrids). One with ordinary skill in the art can readily<br>
select such conditions by varying the temperature during the<br>
hybridization reaction and washing process, the salt<br>
concentration (luring the hybridization reaction and washing<br>
process, and so forth. Specific examples include, but are not<br>
limited to, conditions under which hybridization is brought; about<br>
at 42°C in 6 x SSC (0.9 M NaCl, 0.09 M trisodium citrate) or 6 x<br>
33PE (3M NaCl, 0, 2 M NaH2P04, 20 mM EDTA-2Na, pH 7.4), and the<br>
product, is washed with 0.5 x SSC at 42°C. Preferably, the<br>
condition where the hybridization is performed in 50%<br>
formaldehyde, 6 x SCC (0.9 M NaCl, 0.09M trisodium citrate) or 6<br>
x SSPE (3 M NaCl, 0.2 M NaH2P04, 20 mM EDTA2Na, pH 7.4) at 42°C<br>
and washing with 0.1 x SCC at 42°C is further performed is<br>
included.<br>
The "base sequences with 1 or more bases deleted,<br>
substituted, inserted, or added" referred to here are widely<br>
known by those having ordinary skill in the art to sometimes<br>
retain physiological activity even when the amino acid sequence<br>
of a protein generally having that physiological activity has one<br>
or more amino acids substituted, deleted, inserted, or added.<br>
Genes that have such modifications and that code for a polyamine<br>
synthase (e.g. spermidine synthase) can also be used in the<br>
present invention. For example, the poly A tail or 5', 3' end<br>
nontranslation regions may be "deleted," and bases may be<br>
"deleted" to the extent that amino acids are deleted. Bases may<br>
also be "substituted," as long as no frame shift results. Bases<br>
may also be "added" to the extent that amino acids are added.<br>
However, it is essential that such modifications do not result in<br>
the loss of polyamine synthase (e.g. spermidine synthase)<br>
activity. "Genes with one or more bases deleted, substituted, or<br>
added" are preferred. Such modified DNA can be obtained by<br>
modifying the DNA base sequences of the invention so that amino<br>
acids at specific sites are substituted, deleted, inserted, or<br>
added by site-specific mutagenesis, for example (Nucleic Acid<br>
Research, Vol. 10, No. 20, 6487-6500 (1982)).<br>
Polyandries<br>
Polyamines, the general term for aliphatic hydrocarbons<br>
with 2 or more primary amino groups, are ubiquitous natural<br>
substances in organisms, with more than 20 types discovered so<br>
far. Typical polyamines include putrescine, spermidine, and<br>
spermine. The known primary physiological action of polyamines<br>
includes (1) nucleic acid stabilization and structural<br>
modification through interaction with nucleic acids; (2)<br>
promotion of various nucleic acid synthesis systems; (3)<br>
activation of protein synthesis systems; and (4) stabilization of<br>
cell membranes and enhancement of membrane permeability of<br>
substances. Reports on the role of polyamines in plants include<br>
cell protection and promotion of nucleic acid or protein<br>
biosynthesis during cellular growth or division. As used in the<br>
invention, "spermidine" , one of the typical polyamines, is an<br>
ubiquitous natural substance in organisms, and is an aliphatic<br>
hydrocarbon with three primary amino group.<br>
The involvement of polyamines in various types of<br>
environmental stress has recently been reported. They have been<br>
implicated in cold stress (J. Japan Soc. Hortic. Sci., 68, 780-<br>
787 (1999); J. Japan Soc. Hortic. Sci., 68, 967-973 (1999); Plant<br>
Physiol. 124, 431-439 (2000)); salt stress (Plant Physiol. 91,<br>
500-504 (1984)); acid stress (Plant Cell Physiol. 38(10), 1156-<br>
1166 (1997)); osmotic stress (Plant Physiol. 75, 102-109 (1984));<br>
pathogen infection stress (New Phytol., 135, 467-473 (1997)); and<br>
herbicide stress (Plant Cell Physiol. 39(9), 987-992 (1998)), but<br>
all of these reports assume the involvement of polyamines based<br>
on the correlation between growth reaction or stress tolerance<br>
and changes in polyamine concentration, yet their involvement at<br>
the genetic level between environmental stress tolerance and<br>
polyamine synthase genes was not well studied.<br>
There are other cases in which the polyamine synthase gene<br>
has been introduced into the plant, but regulation of the<br>
expression amount of the stress defense gene has not been studied.<br>
For example, the plant transformed with the spermidine synthase<br>
(SPDS) gene has been reported in tobacco (Non-patent document <br>
Journal of Plant Physiology 161, 989-1001, 2004). The SPDS gene<br>
derived from Datura stramonium has been excessively expressed<br>
constantly in tobacco, and the change of contained polyamine<br>
amounts has been examined. However, the change of the expression<br>
amount of the stress defense genes and the stress tolerance are<br>
not shown at all. The method of increasing the expression amounts<br>
of the stress defense gene group by transforming the plant with<br>
the spermidine synthase (SPDS) gene thereby imparting the stress<br>
defense effects has not been reported until now. Also, the method<br>
of increasing the expression amounts of the stress defense gene<br>
group by transforming the plant with the S-adenosylmethionine<br>
decarboxylase (SAMDC) gene, the arginine decarboxylase (ADC) gene,<br>
the ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) gene and/or the spermine<br>
synthase (SPMS) gene thereby imparting the stress defense effects<br>
has not been reported until now. In addition, it has been<br>
attempted that the polyamine synthase gene is introduced into the<br>
plant, and the change of the contained polyamine amounts has been<br>
examined, but the relationship between the expression level of<br>
the stress defense gene and the improvement of various stress<br>
tolerances has not been examined at all. In the present invention,<br>
the relationship between the expression levels of the stress<br>
defense genes and stress defense genes and the improvement of<br>
various stress tolerances has been disclosed for the first time.<br>
As a result of an extensive study for imparting the stress<br>
defense effects to the plants, the present inventors have found<br>
that it is very important for imparting or improving various<br>
stress tolerances to increase the amount of contained spermidine<br>
or spermine before or during encountering stresses by<br>
transforming the plant with the spermidine synthase (SPDS) gene<br>
and increase the expression levels of the stress defense genes by<br>
the action of increased spermidine or spermine thereby imparting<br>
the stress defense effects. Without wishing to be bound to any<br>
theory, the present inventors believe that (1) spermidine or<br>
spermine increased by transforming the plant with the SPDS gene<br>
acts as a second messenger (signal transducing substance) and<br>
activates tyrosine kinase involved in signal transduction thereby<br>
inducing the expression of the stress defense genes, and (2)<br>
spermidine or spermine increased by transforming the plant with<br>
the SPDS gene is metabolized by polyamine oxidase (PAO) resulting<br>
in increased levels of hydrogen peroxide which activate the<br>
signai transduction thereby inducing the expression of the stress<br>
defense qenes. Since the increase of contained spermidine or<br>
spermine and the action thereof are important for the induction<br>
of the expression of the stress defense genes and the increase of<br>
the expression level thereof, likewise the effect of increasing<br>
the expression levels of the stress defense genes is obtained<br>
also using the S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (SAMDC) gene,<br>
the arginine decarboxylase (ADC) gene, the ornithine<br>
decarboxylase (ODC) gene or the spermine synthase (SPMS) which<br>
can increase the amount of contained spermidine or spermine. A<br>
time period that the expression level of the stress defense gene<br>
is enhanced may be any of constantly, under the condition of nonstress,<br>
before encountering stress and under the condition of<br>
stress. However, the present inventors have found that it is<br>
important to increase the expression amounts of the stress<br>
defense genes within the range in which no effect is given to the<br>
growth and development of the plant constantly or under the<br>
condition of non-stress and impart the stress defense effects to<br>
the plant previously (preliminarily) before encountering stress<br>
(vaccine effect), thereby exhibiting the excellent tolerance and<br>
resistance against various stresses when encountering stress. In<br>
addition, the present inventors have found that the expression<br>
levels of the stress defense genes such as DREB, CBF1 and COR are<br>
increased within the range in which no adverse effect is given to<br>
the growth and development to impart the stress defense effects<br>
by introducing the gene such as SPDS, SAMDC, ADC, ODC and SPMS<br>
into the plant and excessively expressing it under the control of<br>
the promoter, thereby improving the parameters of various stress<br>
tolerances and enhancing the productivity (e.g., yield) and<br>
characters, and have completed the present invention.<br>
Stress defense genes<br>
In the present invention, the "stress defense gene" is a<br>
gene whose expression/induction or expression amount is increased<br>
when the plant encounters stress, and the gene involved in or<br>
ssociated with the stress tolerance. In one preferable<br>
embodiment of the invention, the stress defense genes are the<br>
following 49 genes or the genes having 60% or more, preferably<br>
70% or more, more preferably 80% or more, still more preferably<br>
85% or more and particularly 90% or more homology to these genes<br>
with specific Accession Number.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
number<br>
In another preferable embodiment, the stress defense genes<br>
can belong to the following 1 to 11 categories:<br>
I. CBF1/DREBlB<br>
For example, CBF1, DREB1B of Gene Numbers I, 25 and 42 are<br>
the genes encoding the transcription factors expressed and<br>
induced by stresses (The Plant Cell, 10, 1391-1406, 1998, Proc.<br>
Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 94, 1035-1040, 1997, Plant Physiol., 130,<br>
639-648, 2002), and are shown to have an ERF/AP2 DNA binding<br>
domain arid act as a factor to activate the transcription (Biochem.<br>
Biophys. Res. Commun., 290, 998-1009, 2002, Physiol. Plant, 112,<br>
171-175, 2001). It has been reported that the tolerance against<br>
environmental stresses such as drought, freeze and low<br>
temperature is enhanced by introducing CBF1, DREBlB genes into<br>
the plant (Science, 280, 104-106, 1998, Plant Physiol., 127, 910-<br>
917, 2001, Plant Physiol., 130, 618-626, 2002).<br>
II. CBF3/DREB1A<br>
For example, DREB1A, CBF3 of Gene Numbers 27 and 28 are the<br>
genes encoding the transcription factors expressed and induced by<br>
stresses (The Plant Cell, 10, 1391-1406, 1998, Plant J., 16, 433-<br>
442, 1998, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 250, 161-170, 1998,<br>
Plant Physiol., 130, 639-648, 2002), and are shown to have an<br>
ERF/AP2 DNA binding domain and act as a factor to activate the<br>
transcription (Plant Cell, 13, 61-72, 2001, Biochem. Biophys. Res.<br>
Commun., 290, 998-1009, 2002, The Plant Journal, 38, 982-993,<br>
2004) . It has been reported that the tolerance against<br>
environmental stresses such as drought, salt, freeze and low<br>
temperature is enhanced by introducing CBF1, DREBlB genes into<br>
the plant (The Plant Cell, 10, 1391-1406, 1998, Nat. Biotech., 17,<br>
287-291, 1999, Plant Physiol., 124, 1854-1865, 2000) .<br>
III. DREB2B<br>
For example, DREB2B of Gene Number 32 is the gene encoding<br>
the transcription factors expressed and induced by drought and<br>
salt stress (The Plant Cell, 10, 1391-1406, 1998, Plant Mol.<br>
Biol., 42, 657-665, 2000) , and are shown to have an ERF/AP2 DNA<br>
binding domain and act as a factor to activate the transcription<br>
 (Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 290, 998-1009, 2002) .<br>
IV. LTI78, COR78, rd29A<br>
For example, it has been reported that LTI78(low<br>
temperature induced protein 78), COR78 and rd29A of Gene Number<br>
38 are the genes encoding the proteins expressed and induced by<br>
low temperature stress, drought stress and salt stress and are<br>
deeply involved in the tolerance against low temperature stress,<br>
drought stress and salt stress (Plant Physiol., 103, 1047-1053,<br>
1993, Plant Mol. Biol., 21, 641-653, 1993, Plant Cell, 6,251-264,<br>
1994, Journal of Experimental Botany, 47, 291-305, 1996, Plant<br>
Physiol, 130, 2129-2141, 2002). It has been reported that the<br>
genes (DREB1A, DREB2A) encoding the transcription factors which<br>
bind to the promoter of rd29A are isolated and that the<br>
expression amount of rd29A is increased by introducing the DREB1A<br>
gene into the plant thereby enhancing the tolerance against<br>
environmental stresses such as drought, salt, freeze and low<br>
temperature (The Plant Cell, 10, 1391-1406, 1998, Nat. Biotech.,<br>
17, 287-291, 1999, Plant Physiol., 124, 1854-1865, 2000).<br>
V. RD22/rd22<br>
For example, it has been reported that RD22 and rd22 of<br>
Gene Number 8 are the genes encoding the proteins expressed and<br>
induced by drought stress and are deeply involved in the<br>
tolerance against drought stress (The Plant Cell, 5, 1529-1539,<br>
1993, Mol. Gen. Genet., 247, 391-398, 1995, The Plant Cell, 9,<br>
1859-1868, 1997, Plant Cell., 15(1), 63-78, 2003) .<br>
VI. Corlb<br>
For example, it has been reported that cor15 of Gene Number<br>
3 is the gene encoding the protein expressed and induced by low<br>
temperature stress and drought stress and is deeply involved in<br>
the freeze stress tolerance (Plant Mol. Biol., 23, 1073-1077,<br>
1993, Journal of Experimental Botany, 47, 291-305, 1996). It has<br>
been reported that the freeze stress tolerance is enhanced by<br>
introducing cor!5 gene into the plant (Pro. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA,<br>
93, 13404-13409, 1996, Journal of Plant Physiology, 163, 213-219,<br>
2006), and that the freeze stress tolerance of a chloroplast was<br>
enhanced when the freeze stress tolerance of the chloroplast<br>
isolated from the transformed plant was examined (Pro. Natl. Acad.<br>
Sci. USA, 95, 14570-14575, 1998).<br>
VII. ERD15<br>
For example, it has been reported that ERD15 of Gene Number<br>
5, 30 and 37 are the genes encoding the proteins induced by<br>
drought stress and are deeply involved in the tolerance against<br>
drought stress (Plant Physiology, 106, 1707, 1994) .<br>
VIII. LEA protein<br>
For example, LEA protein of Gene Number 2 is known to be<br>
the gene encoding late embryogenesis abundant(LEA)protein and to<br>
be expressed and induced by various stresses, and it has been<br>
reported that the tolerance against drought stress and salt<br>
stress is enhanced by introducing HVA1 gene which is the LEA<br>
protein gene derived from barley into rice plant, and that the<br>
salt stress tolerance is enhanced in yeast in which the LEA<br>
protein gene derived from tomato has been highly expressed (Plant<br>
Physiology, 110, 249-257, 1996, Gene, 170, 243-248, 1996).<br>
IX. PR-1<br>
For example, PR-1 of Gene Number 4 is known to be the gene<br>
encoding the protein induced by pathogen infection, and to have<br>
an antibacterial activity (Physiol. Mol. Plant Pathol., 55, 85-97,<br>
1999). It has been reported that the tolerance against heavy<br>
metal stress and pathogen infection stress is enhanced by<br>
introducing CABPR1 (Capsicum annuum basic pathogenesis-related<br>
protein 1) gene which is one of PR-1(pathogenesis-related protein<br>
1) into tobacco (Plant Cell Rep., Feb 18, 2005).<br>
X. Peroxidase<br>
For example, peroxidase of Gene Number 19 or 44 is known to<br>
be one (EC 1.11.1.7) of cell wall enzymes in the plant and to be<br>
induced by diseases and stresses, and it has been reported that<br>
the tolerance against oxidative stressoxidative stress and pest<br>
stress ir&gt; enhanced by introducing it into the plant (Plant<br>
Physiology, 132, 1177-1185, 2003, J. Econ. Entomol., 95(1), 81-88,<br>
XI. Hslpro-1<br>
For example, it has been reported that Hslpro-1 (nematode<br>
resistance protein) gene of Gene Number 22 is isolated as a<br>
tolerance gene of nematode and is deeply involved in nematode<br>
tolerance (Science, 275, 832-834, 1997, Plant Mol. Biol., 52,<br>
643-660, 2003) .<br>
In the above 49 genes or genes having 60% or more homology<br>
to the genes and further the genes belonging to I to XI, the<br>
description of the gene of each Gene Number is only an<br>
exemplification, and the stress defense gene can be changed<br>
depending on the type of the plant. Therefore, when the<br>
expression amounts of two or more of 49 genes, genes having 60%<br>
or more homology to the genes and the stress defense genes<br>
belonging to I to XI are increased in the transformant obtained<br>
by introducing the specific polyamine synthase gene into the<br>
plant, this case is included in the method of the present<br>
invention.<br>
For the above stress defense genes, the expression amounts<br>
of two or more of 49 genes (including the genes having 60% or<br>
more homology) and distinct genes of I to XI may be increased,<br>
and the expression amounts of two or more of the genes belonging<br>
to the same group may be increased.<br>
Imparting of stress defense effects<br>
As noted above, in the present invention, "stress" includes<br>
stress received from the environment, such as high temperatures,<br>
low temperatures, low pH, low oxygen, oxidation, salt, osmotic,<br>
drought, water, flooding, cadmium, copper ozone, air pollution,<br>
UV rays, intense light, weak light, pathogens, disease pests,<br>
herbicides and aging . Of these, "heat stress" is stress on<br>
plants due to exposure of the plants to environments over the<br>
upper Limit of optimal growth temperature of the plant. Plants<br>
subject to heat stress are damaged as a result of gradual or<br>
sudden Joss of cellular physiological function. "Cold stress" is<br>
stress on plants due to exposure of the plants to environments<br>
below the minimum optimal growth temperature of the plant. Plants<br>
subject to cold stress are damaged as a result of gradual or<br>
sudden loss of cellular physiological function. "Salt stress" is<br>
stress on plants due to exposure of the plants to environments<br>

as a result of gradual or sudden loss of cellular physiological<br>
function. "Herbicide stress" is stress on plants due to exposure<br>
of the plants to environments over the maximum optimal growth<br>
herbicide concentration of the plant. Plants subject to herbicide<br>

which the plant receives by being infected or diseased with a<br>
pathogen which is unsuitable for plant growth, and the plant<br>
which has received pathogen stress damages physiological<br>
functions gradually or rapidly to cause the disease. "Pest<br>
stress" is stress which the plant receives by insect damage or<br>

In the present invention, the "method of imparting the<br>
stress defense effects" refers to the method of imparting the<br>
stress defense effects in comparison with the period before<br>

productivity decrease due to low temperature stress which the<br>
plant encounters in the growth process by imparting the stress<br>
defense effects to the plant. The "method of imparting high<br>
temperature stress defense effects" is the method capable of<br>
avoiding or reducing the growth inhibition, the disease and the<br>
productivity decrease due to high temperature stress which the<br>
plant: encounters in the growth process by imparting the stress<br>
defense effects to the plant. The "method of imparting salt<br>
stress defense effects" is the method capable of avoiding or<br>
reducing the growth inhibition, the disease and the productivity<br>
decrease-: due to salt stress which the plant encounters in the<br>
growth process by imparting the stress defense effects to the<br>
plant. The "method of imparting osmotic stress defense effects"<br>
is the method capable of avoiding or reducing the growth<br>
inhibition, the disease and the productivity decrease due to<br>
osmotic stress which the plant encounters in the growth process<br>
by imparting the stress defense effects to the plant. The "method<br>
of imparting oxidative stressoxidative stress defense effects" is<br>
the method capable of avoiding or reducing the growth inhibition,<br>
the disease and the productivity decrease due to oxidative<br>
stressoxidative stress which the plant encounters in the growth<br>
process by imparting the stress defense effects to the plant. The<br>
"method of imparting herbicide stress defense effects" is the<br>
method capable of avoiding or reducing the growth inhibition, the<br>
disease and the productivity decrease due to herbicide stress<br>
which the plant encounters in the growth process by imparting the<br>
stress defense effects to the plant. The "method of imparting<br>
freeze stress defense effects" is the method capable of avoiding<br>
or reducing the growth inhibition, the disease and the<br>
productivity decrease due to freeze stress which the plant<br>
encounters in the growth process by imparting the stress defense<br>
effects to the plant. The "method of imparting drought stress<br>
defense effects" is the method capable of avoiding or reducing<br>
the growth inhibition, the disease and the productivity decrease<br>
due to drought stress which the plant encounters in the growth<br>
process by imparting the stress defense effects to the plant. The<br>
"method of imparting pathogen infection stress defense effects"<br>
is the method capable of avoiding or reducing the growth<br>
inhibition, the disease and the productivity decrease due to<br>
pathogen infection stress which the plant encounters in the<br>
growth process by imparting the stress defense effects to the<br>
plant. The "method of imparting pest stress defense effects" is<br>
the method capable of avoiding or reducing the growth inhibition,<br>
the disease arid the productivity decrease due to pest stress<br>
which the plant encounters in the growth process by imparting the<br>
stress defense effects to the plant. The "method of imparting<br>
disease stress defense effects" is the method capable of avoiding<br>
or reducing the growth inhibition, the disease and the<br>
productivity decrease due to disease stress which the plant<br>
encounters in the growth process by imparting the stress defense<br>

defense effects" is the method capable of avoiding or reducing<br>
the growth inhibition, the disease and the productivity decrease<br>
due to aging stress which the plant encounters in the growth<br>
process by imparting the stress defense effects to the plant. The<br>
"method of imparting heavy metal stress defense effects" is the<br>
method capable of avoiding or reducing the growth inhibition, the<br>
disease and the productivity decrease due to heavy metal stress<br>
which the plant encounters in the growth process by imparting the<br>
stress defense effects to the plant. The stabilization of<br>
cultivation, the enhancement of productivity and yield, and the<br>
effective utilization of the cultivation, the environment, the<br>
period, the region and the area can be anticipated by using the<br>
expression amounts of the stress defense genes as indicators or<br>
controlling them. In addition, it is possible to anticipate the<br>
enhancement of productivity of various useful substances (e.g.,<br>
starch, protein) obtained from the plants by increasing the<br>
productivity and the yield of the plants. The expression amount<br>
of the stress defense gene can be utilized as the indicator for<br>
the method of selecting and diagnosing cultivation effective<br>
crops.<br>
A method of the invention can be carried out by introducing<br>
an exogenous polyamine synthase gene to plants having no<br>
exogenous polyamine synthase gene through genetic engineering<br>
means arid making it retained in a stable manner. As used herein,<br>
"retained in a stable manner" means that the polyamine synthase<br>
gene is expressed in the plant at least in which the polyamine<br>
synthase gene has been introduced, and is retained in the plant<br>
cells long enough to result in the improvement of stress<br>
tolerance. The polyamine synthase gene is, therefore, preferably<br>
incorporated on the chromosomes of the host plant. The polyamine<br>
synthase gene or genes should even more preferably be retained in<br>
subsequent generations.<br>
As used herein, "exogenous" means not intrinsic to the plant,<br>
but externally introduced. Accordingly, an "exogenous polyamine<br>
metabolism-related enzyme gene" may be a polyamine synthase gene<br>
homologous to the host plant (that is, derived from the host<br>
plant:) , which is externally introduced by genetic manipulation.<br>
The use of a host-derived polyamine synthase gene is preferred in<br>
consideration of the identity of the codon usage.<br>
The exogenous polyamine synthase gene may be introduced into<br>
plants by any method of genetic engineering. Examples include<br>
protoplast fusion with heterologous plant cells having the<br>
polyamine synthase gene, infection with a plant virus having a<br>
viral genome genetically manipulated to express the polyamine<br>
synthase gene, or transformation of host plant cells using an<br>
expression vector containing the polyamine synthase gene.<br>
The;: plants of the invention are preferably transgenic plants<br>
which are obtained by the transformation of cells of plants<br>
lacking the exogenous polyamine synthase gene in an expression<br>
vector containing the exogenous polyamine synthase under the<br>
control of a promoter capable of functioning in plants.<br>
Examples of promoters capable of functioning in plants<br>
include the 35S promoter of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV)<br>
which functions in plant cells, the nopaline synthase gene (NOS)<br>
promoter, octopine synthase gene (DCS) promoter, phenylalanine<br>
ammonia lyase (PAL) gene promoter, and chalcone synthase (CHS)<br>
gene promoter, ubiquitin (Ubi-1) promoter, peroxidase gene<br>
promoter. Other well-known plant promoters not limited to these<br>
are also available.<br>
Constitutive promoters include a CaMV35S promoter, an actin<br>
promoter (Plant Cell, 2, 163-171, 1990), an ubiquitin promoter<br>
(Plant Mol. Biol., 18, 675-689, 1992) and a rice cyclophilin<br>
promoter (Plant Mol. Biol., 25, 837-843, 1994). If not only the<br>
promoter to constantly or constitutively express in entire organs<br>
but also the promoter specific for the organ or tissue is used,<br>
it: is possible to express the objective gene only in the<br>
particular organ or tissue, and impart the stress defense effects<br>
only to the particular organ or tissue. As the promoter specific<br>
for leaf tissues, an aldP promoter(Mol. Gen. Genet., 248, 668-674,<br>
1995) and a rbcs promoter(Plant Cell Physiol., 35, 773-778, 1994)<br>
can be utilized. As the promoter specific for flower tissues, a<br>
chsA chalcone synthase promoter (Plant Mol. Biol., 15, 95-109,<br>
1990) and an LAT52 promoter (Mol. Gen. Genet., 217, 240-245,<br>
1989) can be utilized. As the promoter specific for roots, root<br>
tubers and stem tubers, an SbPRPl promoter (Plant Mol. Biol., 21,<br>
109-119, 1993) and a sporamin promoter (Mol. Gen. Genet., 225,<br>
369, 199L) can be utilized. For example, the stress defense<br>
effects can be imparted only to the root tuber by using the<br>
polyamine synthase gene and the sporamin promoter which works<br>
specifically for the root tuber.<br>
As inducible promoters, a stress inducible promoter, a<br>
temperature inducible promoter, a light inducible promoter, a<br>
period inducible promoter, a pathogen inducible promoter, and a<br>
disease inducible promoter and the like can be utilized. For<br>
example, by the use of the polyamine synthase gene and the<br>
promoter (e.g., BN115 promoter: Plant physiol.,106, 917-928,<br>
1999) which can induce the transcription only when the plant<br>
encounters the low temperature, it is possible to control<br>
polyamine metabolism of the plant only at low temperature to<br>
impart the low temperature stress defense effect. By the use of<br>
the polyamine synthase gene and the promoter (e.g., Atmyb2<br>
promoter: The Plant Cell, 5, 1529-1539, 1993) which can induce<br>
the transcription only when the plant encounters the drought, it<br>
is possible to control polyamine metabolism of the plant only at<br>
drought to impart the drought stress defense effect. By the use<br>
of peroxidase promoter (Patent No. 3571639, Patent No. 3259178)<br>
induced by various stresses, it is possible to control polyamine<br>
metabolism of the plant only at various stresses to impart the<br>
various stress defense effect. Furthermore, by the use of the<br>
polyamine synthase gene and the promoter which works in a<br>
vegetative stage, it is possible to impart the stress defense<br>
effects only in the vegetative stage.<br>
Preferably, from a notion that it is particularly important<br>
for the stress defense to previously (preliminarily) impart the<br>
stress defense effects to the plant (vaccine-like effect) by<br>
increasing the expression amounts of the stress defense genes<br>
within the range where no adverse effect is given to the growth<br>
and development of the plant before encountering stress,<br>
preferably the steady or constitutive promoter, the promoter<br>
specific tor the organ or the tissue, and the promoter specific<br>
for the period depending on the growth and development can be<br>
used. In particular, the steady or constitutive promoter is<br>
preferable.<br>
The exogenous polyamine synthase gene in the expression<br>
vector of the present invention is located downstream of the<br>
promoter so that transcription is controlled by the promoter<br>
capable of functioning in plants. A transcription termination<br>
signal (terminator region) capable of functioning in plants<br>
should also be added downstream of the polyamine synthase gene.<br>
An example is the terminator NOS (nopaline synthase) gene.<br>
The expression vector of the present invention may also<br>
contain a cis-regulatory element such as an enhancer sequence.<br>
The expression vector may also contain a marker gene for<br>
selecting transformants such as a drug-resistance gene marker,<br>
examples of which include the neomycin phosphotransferase II<br>
(NPTII) gene, the phosphinothricin acetyl transferase (PAT) gene,<br>
and the glyophosate resistance gene. Because the incorporated<br>
gene is sometimes dropped in the absence of selection pressure,<br>
it is advantageous to ensure that a herbicide resistance gene is<br>
also present on the vector so that the use of a herbicide during<br>
cultivation will always result in conditions involving selection<br>
pressure.<br>
To facilitate mass production and purification, the<br>
expression vector should also contain a selection marker gene<br>
(such as ampicillin resistance gene or tetracycline resistance<br>
gene) in E. coli and a replication origin capable of autonomous<br>
replication in E. coli. The expression vector of the present<br>
invention can be constructed in a simple manner by inserting the<br>
selection marker gene as needed and an expression cassette of the<br>
polyamine synthase gene at the cloning site of an E. coli vector<br>
(pUC or pBR series).<br>
When the exogenous polyamine metabolism-related enzyme gene<br>
is introduced by infection with Agrobacterium tumefaciens or<br>
Aqrobacterium rhizogenes, the polyamine synthase gene expression<br>
cassette can be inserted in the T-DNA region (region transferred<br>
to plant chromosome) on a Ti or Ri plasmid of the cells. At<br>
present, binary vector systems are used in standard methods of<br>
transformation with Agrobacterium. The necessary functions for T--<br>
DNA transfer are independently provided by both the T-DNA itself<br>
and the Ti (or Ri) plasmid, these structural elements being<br>
divided on separate vectors. The binary plasmid has 25 bp border<br>
sequences at both ends necessary for cleaving and combining the<br>
T-DNA, and the plant hormone gene inducing crown gall (or hairy<br>
root) is removed, simultaneously providing room for inserting the<br>
exogenous gene. Examples of commercially available binary vectors<br>
include pBHOl and pBI121 (by Clontech) . The Vir region involved<br>
in the incorporation of the T-DNA has trans action on the<br>
separate Ti (or Ri) plasmid referred to as the helper plasmid.<br>
Various conventionally known methods can be used for the<br>
transformation of the plants. Examples include the PEG method in<br>
which protoplasts are isolated from plant cells by treatment with<br>
a cell wall-degrading enzyme such as cellulase or hemicellulase,<br>
and polyethylene glycol is added to a suspension of the<br>
protoplasts and an expression vector containing the<br>
aforementioned polyamine synthase gene expression cassette to<br>
incorporate the expression vector into the protoplasts by a<br>
process such as endocytosis; the liposome method in which an<br>
expression vector is introduced by ultrasonic treatment or the<br>
like into lipid membrane vesicles such as phosphatidylcholine,<br>
and the vesicles are fused with protoplasts in the presence of<br>
PEG; methods of fusion in a similar process using micelles; and<br>
electroporation in which electrical pulses are applied to a<br>
suspension of protoplasts and an expression vector to incorporate<br>
the vectors in the external solution into the protoplasts.<br>
However, these methods are complicated in that they require a<br>
culturing technique for the redifferentiation of the protoplasts<br>
into plants. Processes for introducing the gene into intact cells<br>
with cell walls include direct injection such as microinjection<br>
in which a micropipette is inserted into cells to inject the<br>
vector DNA in the pipettes under hydraulic or gas pressure into<br>
the cells, or the particle gun method in which metal<br>
microparticles coated with DNA are accelerated through the<br>
detonation of an explosive or gas pressure and thus introduced<br>
into the cells, and methods involving the use of infection with<br>
Agrobacterium. Drawbacks of microinjection are the need for<br>
considerable training and the small number of cells that are<br>
handled. It is therefore more desirable to transform plants with<br>
more convenient methods such as the Agrobacterium method and the<br>
particle gun method. The particle gun method is useful in that<br>
genes can be directly introduced into the apical meristem of<br>
plants while cultivated. In the Agrobacterium method, the genomic<br>
DNA of a plant virus such as the tomato golden mosaic virus<br>
(TGMV) or another gemirii virus is simultaneously inserted between<br>
the border sequences into the binary vector, so that the viral<br>
infection can spread throughout the entire plant and the target<br>
gene can be simultaneously introduced into the entire plant<br>
simply by inoculating cells at any location of the cultivated<br>
plant with the viral cell suspension. These methods are known in<br>
the art, and the ordinary skilled person can choose a suitable<br>
method for a plant being transformed.<br>
Transformed plants in accordance with the invention can be<br>
evaluated, for example, for their cold stress tolerance by low<br>
temperature treatment for 1 to 10 days at 0 to 20°C, followed by<br>
growth at 25 to 30°C to study the state of growth, low temperature<br>
damage, or the like. In the transformed plants produced in the<br>
present invention, for example, the low temperature stress<br>
tolerance can be evaluated by low temperature treatment at 0 to<br>
20°C for 1 to 10 days followed by growing at 25 to 30°C to examine<br>
the state; of growth, low temperature damages, and the like. The<br>
low temperature stress tolerance can be evaluated by growing<br>
maize at 10 to 18°C for the whole growth period and examining the<br>
state of growth and the wet weight (yield). Heat stress tolerance<br>
can be evaluated by low temperature treatment for 1 to 10 days at<br>
35 to 50°C, followed by growth at 25 to 30°C to study the state of<br>
growth, high temperature damage, or the like. The high<br>
temperature stress tolerance can be evaluated by growing maize at<br>
35 to 45°C for the whole growth period and examining the state of<br>
growth and the wet weight (yield). Salt stress tolerance can be<br>
evaluated by studying the state of growth, salt stress damage, or<br>
the like following growth at 25 to 30°C on medium containing 10 to<br>
300 mM NaCl. The salt stress tolerance can be evaluated by<br>
growing the maize in the potting compost containing 10 to 15 mM<br>
NaCl for the whole growth period and examining the state of<br>
growth and the wet weight (yield). Drought and water stress<br>
tolerance can be evaluated by studying the state of growth and<br>
the extent of damage after the supply of water has been<br>
terminated. The tolerance against drought and water stress can be<br>
evaluated by growing the maize in the potting compost where<br>
watering is limited and examining the state of growth and the wet<br>
weight (yield).<br>
Examples of plants which may be transformed in the<br>
invention include, but are not limited to, dicotyledons,<br>
monocotyledons, herbaceous plants, and shrubs. Examples include<br>
sweet potatoes, tomatoes, cucumbers, squash, melons, watermelon,<br>
tobacco, Arabidopsis thaliana, bell peppers, eggplant, beans,<br>
taro, spinach, carrots, strawberries, white potatoes, rice, corn,<br>
alfalfa, wheat, barley, soybeans, rapeseed, sorghum, Eucalyptus,<br>
poplar, kenaf, Eucormia ulmoides, sugarcane, sugar beet, cassava,<br>
betterave, sago palm, Chenopodium album, lilies, orchids,<br>
carnations, roses, chrysanthemum, petunias, Torenia fournieri,<br>
antirrhinum, cyclamen, gypsohila, geranium, sunflowers, Zoisia<br>
japonica, cotton, matsutake mushrooms, shiitake mushrooms,<br>
mushrooms, ginseng, citrus fruits, bananas, and kiwi fruit. Sweet<br>
potatoes, tomatoes, cucumbers, rice, corn, soybeans, wheat,<br>
petunias, Torenia fournieri, Eucalyptus, and cotton are preferred.<br>
According to the present invention, it became possible to<br>
increase the polyamine amount before or during encountering<br>
stress by introducing the polyamine synthase gene into the plant<br>
and to impart multiple stress defense effects by increasing the<br>
expressxon amounts of multiple genes involved in the stress<br>
tolerance or the stress resistance. Furthermore, it is possible<br>
to anticipate the stabilization of the cultivation, the<br>
enhancement of the productivity and the yield, and the<br>
enlargement of the cultivation regions and the areas. Furthermore,<br>
it is also possible to anticipate the enhancement of the<br>
productivity of useful substances (e.g., starch, natural dyes)<br>
obtained from the plants by increasing the productivity and the<br>
yield of the plants.<br>
The plants of the present invention are not limited to<br>
entire plants (whole plants) and include callus thereof, seeds,<br>
all plant tissues, leaves, stems, vines, roots, root tubers or<br>
stem tubers, flowers and the like. In addition, progenies thereof<br>
are also included in the plants of the present invention.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is illustrated in further detail by the<br>
following examples, but they are provided only as examples and do<br>
not in any way limit the scope of the invention.<br>
Method of analyzing polyamine<br>
A wild type (non-recombinant plant) and transformants (gene<br>
recombinant plants) can be simultaneously cultivated, and the<br>
amounts of polyamine contained in the leaf, stem, root, seed,<br>
fruit and the like can be examined. Since the amount of contained<br>
polyamine is changed depending on the state of growth, it is<br>
important to examine the tissues whose growth periods and<br>
cultivation periods are the same (e.g., in the case of leaves,<br>
the same leaf age) by cultivating under the same condition.<br>
Polyamine includes free polyamine, combined polyamine and bound<br>
polyamine, extraction methods thereof are different, but all can<br>
be analyzed (Plant Cell Physiol., 43(2), 196-206, 2002). As a<br>
specific example, the method of analyzing free polyamine in the<br>
leaf will be described in detail. The leaves (about 0.1 to 1.0 g)<br>
(young leaves at the same leaf age) are sampled and frozen/stored.<br>
Dilution internal standard solution (1,6-hexanediarnine, internal<br>
standard content = 7.5 or 12 nrnol) and 5% perchloric acid aqueous<br>
solution (5 to 10 mL per 1.0 g specimen fresh weight) were added<br>
to the sampled specimen, and was thoroughly ground down and<br>
extracted using an ornnimixer at room temperature. The ground<br>
solution was centrifuged at 4° C, 35,000 x g for 20 minutes, and<br>
the supernatant: was collected and was taken as the free polyamine<br>
solution. Four hundred microliters of free polyamine solution,<br>
2 0 0 o f saturated sodium carbonate aqueous solution, and 200 [XL<br>
of dansyl chloride/acetone solution (10 mg/mL) were added into a<br>
microtube with a screw cap, and lightly mixed. After firmly<br>
closing with a tube stopper and covering with aluminum foil,<br>
dansylation was conducted by heating for 1 hour in a 60°C water<br>
bath. After allowing the tube to cool, 200 of proline aqueous<br>
solution (100 mg/mL) was added and mixed. The tube was covered<br>
with aluminum foil and heated again for 30 minutes in a water<br>
bath. After standing to cool, the acetone was removed by spraying<br>
nitrogen gas, and then 600 of toluene was added and vigorously<br>
mixed. After allowing the tube to stand quietly and separate into<br>
2 phases, 300 to 4 0 0 o f toluene in the upper layer was<br>
separated into a microtube. The toluene was completely removed by<br>
spraying nitrogen gas. 100 to 200 ^L of methanol was added to the<br>
tube and the dansylated free polyamine was dissolved. The free<br>
polyamine content of putrescine, spermidine and spermine was<br>
assayed by the internal standard method using high performance<br>
liquid chromatography connected to a fluorescence detector<br>
(exitataon wavelength is 365 run, emission wavelength is 510 run) .<br>
A piBondapak C18 (manufactured by Waters, Co.: 027324, 3.9x300 mm,<br>
particle size 10 [4m) was used for the HPLC column. The polyamine<br>
content in the specimens was calculated by deriving the peak<br>
areas of the polyamine and internal standard from the HPLC charts<br>
of the standard solution and specimens. For example, from the<br>
results of the polyamine analysis, cell lines in which the amount<br>
of contained spermidine or spermine has been increased 1.1 to <br>
times compared with non-transformed plant (wild type) which has<br>
not been transformed with the exogenous polyamine synthase gene<br>
are selected or screened in the cell lines of transformants<br>
transformed with the exogenous polyamine synthase gene.<br>
Method of analyzing stress defense gene using microarray<br>
T3 homozygous cell lines in which the amount of contained<br>
spermidine or spermine has been increased 1.1 to 3.0 times<br>
compared with the wild type are selected in the transformants.<br>
The seeds from the wild type (WT) and the T3 homozygous cell<br>
lines (TSP-16, OSP-2) are seeded in plastic pots containing the<br>
potting compost (Metromix 250 supplied from Hyponex Japan).<br>
Sufficient water is given to the soil, which is then covered with<br>
Saran wrap to perform the cold temperature treatment for 2 days<br>
(synchronization). The pots after the cold temperature treatment<br>
are transferred to a cultivation room, and acclimation for about<br>
one week is performed under a long day condition (22°C, 16 hours'<br>
light, 50 fimol m~2 sec"1 PPFD) . After one week, the Saran wrap is<br>
removed, and the cultivation is started under the above long day<br>
condition. On the 50th day (just before internode elongation)<br>
after the start of cultivation, an overground part and a root<br>
part are separately sampled. Their fresh weights are measured,<br>
and immediately they are frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at<br>
-80°C. Total RNA is extracted using TRIZOL reagent(supplied from<br>
GIBCO-BRL) in accordance with its protocol. Furthermore, the<br>
total RN7i is purified using RNeasy column (supplied from Qiagen)<br>
in accordance with its protocol. Probes are prepared from 40 (xg<br>
of 3 kinds of total RNA (WT, TSP-16, OSP-2). The probes are<br>
prepared using LabelStar Array labeling kit (supplied from<br>
Qiagen) by Cyanine 3-dUTP and Cyanine 5-dUTP in accordance with<br>
its protocol. cDNA array chips (donated by Professor Takayuki<br>
Kawauchi of Nara Institute of Science and Technology Graduate<br>
University) and/or DNA array chips (Arabidopsis supplied from<br>
Agilent Technologies) are used for the array analysis. The array<br>
chips are prehybridized in prehybridization buffer (4*SSC, 1% BSA,<br>
0.1% SDS) at 37°C for one hour. The array chips are washed with<br>
highly purified Milli Q water. This manipulation is repeated<br>
twice. Contained water is removed using a plate centrifuge (1500<br>
rpm, 5 minutes) . The array chips are dried in an incubator set at<br>
65°C for one or more hours. Hybridization is performed using the<br>
probe produced by LabelStar Array labeling kit. The array chips<br>
are hybridized with hybridization buffer (4 x SSC, 10 x Denhart<br>
solution, 1% BSA, 0.2% SDS, 1 of poly A, 0.03 of<br>
yeast tRNA) containing 35 of the probe at 60 to 65°C for 17<br>
hours. After the hybridization, the array chips are washed with<br>
washing solutions starting from 1 x SSC and 0.2% SDS at 65°C to<br>
finally 0.2 x SSC at room temperature. Scanning and data analysis<br>
are performed using Scan ArraySOOO and QuantArray software<br>
(supplied from GSI Lumonics) or ScanArray4000XL (supplied from<br>
Packard Biochip Technologies). A fluorescence value of a negative<br>
control is used for background, and the background is subtracted<br>
from a fluorescence value of each spot. Either a median<br>
normalization method or a global normalization method is used for<br>
the normalization. In order to increase reliability of the<br>
microarray analysis, the analysis is repeated several times for<br>
each array chip.<br>
Example 1: Cloning spermidine synthase gene derived from plant<br>
A spermidine synthase gene derived from Cucurbita ficifolia<br>
Bouch was acquired in accordance with the description in Example<br>
2 in W002/23974 (FSPD1, SEQ ID NOS:1 and 2). A spermidine<br>
synthase gene (OSPD2, SEQ ID NOS:3 and 4) derived from the rice<br>
plant was acquired by the method shown below. In accordance with<br>
the description in Example 2 in W002/23974, the spermidine<br>
synthase gene(FSPDl, SEQ ID NOS:1 and 2) derived from Cucurbita<br>
ficifolia Bouch, an S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase gene<br>
(FSAM24, SEQ ID NOS:5 and 6) and an arginine decarboxylase gene<br>
(FADC76, SEQ ID NOS:7 and 8) were obtained. A spermidine synthase<br>
gene (FSPM5, SEQ ID NOS:9 and 10) derived from Arabidopsis<br>
tha Liana was obtained in accordance with the description in<br>
Example 1 in ,JP 2002-351750 A. The spermidine synthase gene<br>
(OSPD2, SEQ ID NOS:3 and 4) derived from the rice plant was<br>
acquired by the method shown below.<br>
(1) Preparation of poly (A) + RNA<br>
After removing rice chaff from fully matured seeds of a<br>
rice plant cultivar ("Yukihikari"), the seeds were immersed in<br>
70% ethanol for 5 minutes, and subsequently sterilized by<br>
immersing them in a sterilization solution (5% sodium<br>
hypochlorite, 0.02% Triton X-100) for 20 minutes in a beaker<br>
similarly sterilized. The sterilized seeds were washed three<br>
times with sterilized water in the sterilized beaker. After<br>
washing, the seeds were placed on a growth medium (MS inorganic<br>
salts, MS vitamins, 30 g/L of sucrose, 8 g/L of Phytagar, pH 5.8),<br>
and cultured in a plant incubator (MLR-350HT, supplied from<br>
Sanyo) at 26°C under a light place condition (45 mol nf2 s"1, a<br>
light phase for 16 hours and a dark phase for 8 hours,<br>
hereinafter this light condition is referred to as the light<br>
place). On about 10th day, the low temperature treatment was<br>
started by lowering the temperature in the incubator to 12°C at<br>
day and night. On 3 days after the start of the treatment,<br>
sampling was performed. The samples were stored at -80°C until<br>
use for RNA extraction.<br>
Young seedlings (about 3 g) were immediately frozen in<br>
liquid nitrogen, and finely pulverized in a mortar in the<br>
presence of liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted using TRIZOL<br>
reagent(supplied from GIBCO-BRL) in accordance with its protocol.<br>
A total RNA solution was incubated at 65°C for 5 minutes, and then<br>
rapidly cooled on ice. An equivalent amount of 2 x binding buffer<br>
(10 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM EDTA2Na, I M NaCl, 0.5% SDS, pH 7.5) was<br>
added to this total RNA solution. This mixture was overlaid in an<br>
oligo dT cellulose column (supplied from Clontech) previously<br>
equilibrated with equilibration buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM<br>
EDTA2Na, 0.5 M NaCl, 0.5% SDS, pH 7.5). Then, the column was<br>
washed with about 10 time amount of the foregoing equilibration<br>
buffer, and subsequently, the poly (A) + RNA was eluted with<br>
elution buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM EDTA2Na, pH 7.5). The<br>
foregoing aqueous solution of 3 M sodium acetate at 1/10 time<br>
amount and ethanol at 2.5 time amount were added to the resulting<br>
elution, and the mixture was then left stand at -80°C. Thereafter,<br>
the centrifugation at 1.0,000 x g was performed, and the resulting<br>
precipitate was washed with 70% ethanol and dried under reduced<br>
pressure?. This dried preparation was dissolved again in 500 [iL of<br>
TE buffer, and repeatedly purified on the oligo dT cellulose<br>
column. The obtained poly (A) + RNA derived from the young<br>
seedlings of the rice plant to which the cold temperature<br>
treatment had been given was used for making a cDNA library.<br>
(2) Preparation of cDNA library<br>
The cDNA library was prepared using a Marathon cDNA<br>
Amplification Kit (by Clontech) according to protocol. The poly<br>
(A) +RNA was used as template, and reverse transcriptase and<br>
modified lock-docking oligo(dT) primer with two degenerate<br>
nucleotide positions at the 3' end were used to synthesize cDNA.<br>
A Marathon cDNA adapter (the 5' end phosphorylated to facilitate<br>
binding to both ends of the ds cDNA with T4 DNA ligase) was<br>
ligated to both ends of the synthesized cDNA. The resulting<br>
adapter-linked cDNA was used as a cDNA library.<br>
(3) Design of PCR primers<br>
The? base sequences of spermidine synthase genes already<br>
isolated from plants or mammals were compared. Regions with<br>
extremely highly conserved homology were selected to synthesize<br>
DNA oligomers (sequence primers I 'II).<br>
SPDS primer I (SEQ ID NO. 11): 5' -GTTTTGGATGGAGTGATTCA-3'<br>
SPDS primer II (SEQ ID NO. 12): 5'-GTGAATCTCAGCGTTGTA-3'<br>
(4) Amplification by PCR<br>
The cDNA library obtained in (2) was used as template, and<br>
the sequence primers designed in (3) were used for PCR. The PCR<br>
steps involved 5 cycles of 30 seconds at 94°C, 1 minute at 45°C,<br>
and 2 minutes at 72°C, followed by 30 cycles of 30 seconds at 94°C,<br>
1 minute at 55°C, and 2 minutes at 72°C.<br>
(5) Agaiose GeJ Electrophoresis<br>
The PCR amplified products were separated by<br>
electrophoresis with 1.5% agarose, and the electrophoresed gel<br>
was stained with ethidium bromide to detect amplified bands on a<br>
UV transi1lumiriator.<br>
 (6) Verification and Recovery of PCR Amplified Products<br>
The detected amplified bands were verified and were cut out<br>
of the agarose gel with a razor. The pieces of gel were<br>
transferred to 1.5 mL microtubes, and the DNA fragments were<br>
isolated and purified from the gel using a QIAEX II Gel<br>
Extraction Kit (by QIAGEN). The recovered DNA fragments were<br>
subcloned to the pGEMT cloning vector (by Promega), transformed<br>
with E. coli, and then used to prepare plasmid DNA in the usual<br>
manner.<br>
(7) Sequencing<br>
The sequencing of the sequences inserted into the plasmids<br>
were determined by the dideoxy method (Messing, Methods in<br>
Enzymol., 101, 20-78 (1983)).<br>
(8) Detection of Homology<br>
A homology search of the base sequences of these genes<br>
against a database of known gene base sequences revealed that the<br>
obtained genes had 70 to 100% homology with known plant-derived<br>
spermidine synthase (SPDS) genes<br>
(9) Isolation of full length gene<br>
The full length gene was isolated by 5' -RACE (rapid<br>
amplification of cDNA ends) using Marathon cDNA Amplification Kit<br>
(supplied from Clontech) and the method of integrating 3'-RACE<br>
(Chenchik et al., 1995). 5'-RACE was performed by PCR with the<br>
cDNA library as a template using API primer (5'-<br>
CCATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3' ) and a primer (5'-<br>
TCCCTCGCGTAGCTGTCGGGTTTGA-3') specific for the gene. The PCR was<br>
performed with 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 seconds, 60°C for 45<br>
seconds and 72°C for 2 minutes and then one cycle of 94°C for 30<br>
seconds, 60°C for 45 seconds and 72°C for 7 minutes. 3'-RACE was<br>
performed by PCR with the cDNA library as a template using API<br>
primer -CCATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3' ) and a primer (5'-<br>
ACACAACGCCTCCTGGTCGAAGAGC-3') specific for the gene. The PCR was<br>
performed with 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 seconds, 60°C for 45<br>
seconds and 72°C for 2 minutes and then one cycle of 94°C for 30<br>
seconds, 60°C for 45 seconds and 72°C for 7 minutes. Gene<br>
fragments obtained in 5'-RACE and 3'RACE were subcloned into<br>
pGEM-T cloning vector (supplied from Promega), respectively.<br>
Furthermore, all base sequences were determined in accordance<br>
with the foregoing method, and analyzed by DINASIS-Mac version<br>
3.6 software package (supplied from Hitachi Software Engineering)<br>
The full length spermidine synthase gene derived from<br>
Cucurbita fid folia Bouch was designated as FSPD1 (SEQ ID NOS: 1<br>
and 2), the full length spermidine synthase gene derived from the<br>
rice plant was designated as OSPD2 (SEQ ID NOS:3 and 4), the full<br>
length S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase gene was designated as<br>
FSAM24 (SEQ ID NOS:5 and 6), the full length arginine<br>
decarboxylase gene was designated as FADC76 (SEQ ID NOS:7 and 8),<br>
and the full length spermidine synthase gene derived from<br>
Arabidopsis thaliana was designated as FSPM5 (SEQ ID NOS:9 and<br>
10) .<br>
The obtained FSPDl and OSPD2 were compared with known<br>
spermidine synthase genes derived from the plants at amino acid<br>
level, and consequently, FSPDl was observed to have about 80%<br>
homology to the spermidine synthase gene derived from the other<br>
plant. OSPD2 was observed to have 100% homology to OsSPDS2<br>
(Journal of Plant Physiology, 161, 883-886, 2004) which was the<br>
spermidine synthase gene derived from the rice plant. FSAM24 was<br>
compared with known S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase genes<br>
(SAMDC genes) derived from the plants at amino acid level, and<br>
consequently FSAM24 was observed to have 63 to 66% homology.<br>
FADC76 was compared with known arginine decarboxylase genes<br>
derived from the plants, and consequently, FADC76 was observed to<br>
have 71 to 77% homology. FSPM5 was compared with spermidine<br>
synthase gene (ACL5: GeriBarik Accession Number AF184093) derived<br>
from Arabidopsis thaliana at amino acid level, complete<br>
concordance of the amino acids was observed.<br>

pRK2013 helper plasmid were cultured for 1 night at 37°C on LB<br>
medium containing 50 mg/L kanamycin, and the Agrobacterium C58<br>
strain was cultured for 2 nights at 37°C on LB medium containing<br>
50 mg/L kanamycin. Cells were harvested from 1.5 mL of each<br>
culture in Eppendorf tubes and then washed with LB medium. The<br>
cells were suspended in 1 mL of LB medium, 100 \iL each of the<br>
three types of cells were mixed to inoculate LB agar medium and<br>
cultured at 28°C to allow the plasmids to be conjugated with the<br>
Agrobacterium (tripartite conjugation). After 1 or 2 days,<br>
portions were scraped with a platinum loop and smeared on LB agar<br>
medium containing 50 mg/L kanamycin, 20 mg/L hygromycin, and 25<br>
mg/L chloramphenicol. After 2 days of culture at 28°C, a variety<br>
of single colonies were selected. The resulting transformants<br>
were designated C58/pBl35S-FSPDl+/-, C58/pBIC2-FSPDl+/-,<br>
C58/pBl35S-F3AM24+/-, C58/pBIC2-FSAM24+/-, C58/pBI35S-FADC76+/-,<br>

C58/pB!35S-FSPM5+/- or C58/pBIC2-FSPM5+/-. Transgenic Arabidopsis<br>
thaliana was prepared by reduced pressure infiltration ((3)<br>
through (6) below).<br>
(3) Cultivation of Arabidopsis thaliana<br>
Potting compost Metromix (Hyponex Japan) was placed in<br>
plastic pots, the surfaces were covered with netting mesh, and 2<br>
to 5 seeds (donated by Professor Takayuki Kawauchi of Nara<br>
Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University) of<br>
Arabidopsis thaliana (referred to below as the "Columbia strain"<br>
or "wild type") were inoculated through the interstices of the<br>
mesh. The pots were placed for 2 days at 4°C in a low temperature<br>
chamber to germinate, and were then transferred for cultivation<br>
under 22°C long-day conditions (16 hour long day/8 hour night) .<br>
After about 4 to 6 weeks, lateral shoots were induced by top<br>
pruning plants in which the main axis flower stalk was extended<br>
to between 5 and 10 cm. After about 1 to 2 weeks of top pruning,<br>
the plants were infected with Agrobacterium.<br>
( 4 ) Preparation of Agrobacterium suspension<br>
Two days before infection, the Agrobacterium prepared in<br>
(2) above was used to inoculate 10 mL LB medium containing<br>
antibiotics (50 mL kanamycin, 20 mL hygromycin) for 24<br>
hours of shaking culture at 28°C. Portions of the culture were<br>
transferred to 1000 ml LB medium containing antibiotics (50 jxg/mL<br>
kanamycin, 20 /mL hygromycin) for about another 24 hours of<br>
shaking culture at 28°C (to an OD60o of between 1.2 and 1.5). Cells<br>
were harvested from the culture at ambient temperature and were<br>
resuspended in suspension medium for infiltration (0.5 x MS salt,<br>
0.5 x Gamborg B5 vitamin, 1% sucrose, 0.5 g/L MES, 0.44 ^M<br>
benzylaminopurine, 0.02% Silwet-77) to an ODeoo of between 0.8 and<br>
1.<br>
(5) Agrobacterium Infection<br>
The potting soil in the pots of Arabidopsis thaliana<br>
prepared in (3) above was watered to prevent the potting soil<br>
from absorbing the Agrobacterium suspension prepared in (4) above.<br>
Approximately 200 to 300 mL of the Agrobacterium suspension was<br>
placed in 1000 mL beakers, and the potted Arabidopsis thaliana<br>
was turned upside down to dip the plants in the suspension. The<br>
beakers in which the pots had been placed were put into a<br>
dessicator, which was suctioned with a vacuum pump to about -<br>
0.053 MPa (400 mmHg) , and the plants were then allowed to stand<br>
for about 10 minutes. The negative pressure was gradually<br>
released, the plants were then taken out of the Agrobacterium<br>
suspension, the excess Agrobacterium suspension was wiped off<br>
with a Kimtowel, and the pots were placed on their sides in deepbottomed<br>
trays. A small amount of water was introduced, and the<br>
plants were covered with saran wrap. The plants were allowed to<br>
stand in this manner for about 1 day. The saran wrap was then<br>
removed, and the pots were placed upright and irrigation was<br>
stopped for about I week. The potting compost was then gradually<br>
watered, and seeds were harvested from matured pods for about 3<br>
to 5 weeks. The harvested seeds were strained through a tea<br>
strainer to eliminate debris and husks, and the seeds were placed<br>
in a dessicator and thoroughly dried.<br>
(6) Obtaining Transformed Plants<br>
100 \iL (about 2000) seeds obtained in (5) above were<br>
transferred to 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes and soaked for 2 minutes in<br>
70% ethanol and 15 minutes in 5% sodium hypochlorite solution,<br>
and the seeds were finally washed five times with sterile water<br>
to disinfect the seeds. The disinfected seeds were transferred to<br>
15 mL falcon tubes, about 9 mL of 0.1% aseptic agar solution was<br>
added, and the contents were vigorously mixed. A 0.1% agar<br>
mixture of seeds was evenly spread on selection medium (1 x MS<br>
salt, 1 x Gamborg B5 vitamin, 1% sucrose, 0.5 g/L MES, 0.8% agar,<br>
100 mg/L carbenicillin, 50 mg/L kanamycin, 40 mg/L hygromycin, 8<br>
g/L Phytagar, pH 5.7) like plating the phages. The plates were<br>
dried for about 30 minutes in a clean bench, a 4°C low temperature<br>
treatment was performed for 2 days, the plates were transferred<br>
to a 22°C growth chamber, and transformants with antibiotic<br>
resistance were selected. Plants with about 3 to 5 true leaves<br>
were again transferred to fresh selection medium and cultivated<br>
until 4 to 6 true leaves had grown. Transformants with antibiotic<br>
resistance (Tl) were planted in pots filled with compost and<br>
acclimated under humid conditions for about 5 to 7 days. After<br>
acclimation, the plants were cultivated at 23°C under long day<br>
conditions (16 hour long days/8 hour nights). The resulting<br>
transformed plants (Tl) and plants T2 grown from seeds (T2)<br>
obtained from the transformed plants were analyzed for genes<br>
introduced by PCR or Southern hybridization and their levels of<br>
expression by Northern hybridization were analyzed, and<br>
transformants which are confirmed that the target spermidine<br>
synthase genes had been incorporated in a stable manner and<br>
expressed was selected. Seeds T3 were also harvested from the<br>
plants T2, and antibiotic resistance tests (segregation analysis)<br>
were conducted to obtain homozygotes (T2) based on the proportion<br>
in which transformants appeared. Seeds T2 and seeds T3 obtained<br>
from the homozygotes (T3 homozygous cell line) were used in the<br>
following tests.<br>
(7)Northern Blotting Analysis<br>
In order to confirm expression levels of FSPD1 and OSPD2 in<br>
T2 transformants obtained in (6), Northern blotting was performed.<br>
Total RNA was extracted from untransformed wild type (WT) and T2<br>
transfonnant (FSPD1 introduced cell lines: TSP-14, 15, 16, 17,<br>
19; OSPD2 introduced cell lines: OSP-1, 2) rosette leaves. The<br>
RNA extraction was performed according to an ordinary method. 10<br>
Hg of the resulting total RNA was electrophoresed on 1.5%<br>
formaldehyde agarose gel and blotted over night on HyBond N nylon<br>
membranes. The RNA was fixed with a UV crosslinker and then prehybridized<br>
for 2 hours at 42°C in pre-hybridization buffer (50%<br>
formamide, 5 x SSPE, 5 x Denhardt's, 0.1% SDS, 80 [iq/mL salmon<br>
sperm DNA, pH 7.0). Probes were prepared with the use of 32P-dCTP<br>
and a random label kit (by Amersham) from the cDNA of the rice<br>
SPDS gene fracment arid Cucurbits ficifolia Bouche SPDS gene<br>
fragment obtained in (6) of Example 1. The probe was added to the<br>
pre-hybridization mixture for hybridization over night at 42°C.<br>
After the hybridization, the membranes were washed twice for 30<br>
minutes at 55°C, beginning with a washing solution containing 2 x<br>
SSC and 0.1% SDS, for 30 minutes at 50°C with a washing solution<br>
containing 0.5 x SSC and 0.1% SDS, and ending with a washing<br>
solution containing 0.1 x SSC and 0.1% SDS. Autoradiographs of<br>
the membranes were taken using X-ray film (Kodak). Part of the<br>
results of Northern blotting are given in Figure l.The results in<br>
Figure 1 show that no expression of the exogenous Cucurbita<br>
ficifolia Bouche SPDS gene (FSPD1) or rice SPDS gene (OSPD2) was<br>
detected in the wild type (WT), but that signals were detected in<br>
all the cell lines at high levels, and expression of FSPD1 and<br>
OSPD2 was confirmed.<br>
(8) Polyamine analysis<br>
Cell lines were selected from the results of PCR (or<br>
Southern analysis), Northern analysis or Western analysis.<br>
Polyamine analysis was performed for the cell lines in which the<br>
polyamine metabolism-relating enzyme gene had been absolutely<br>
introduced and the gene was stably expressed. The cell lines,<br>
TSP-14, TSP-15, TSP-16, TSP-17, TSP-19 and TSP-101, in which<br>
F3PD1 had been introduced in a sense direction, the cell lines,<br>
TSA-1 and TSA-4 in which FSAM24 had been introduced in the sense<br>
direction, the cell lines, TAD-3 and TAD-5, in which FADC76 had<br>
been introduced in the sense direction, and the cell lines, TSM-3<br>
and TSM-7, in which FSPM5 had been introduced in the sense<br>
direction were selected. The cell lines, OSP-1, OSP-2, OSP-5 and<br>
OSP-7, in which OSPD2 had been introduced in the sense direction<br>
were selected. About 0.1 to 0.5 g of rosette leaves were sampled<br>
from wild type (WT) and transformants (TSP, OSP), and stored<br>
frozen. Diluted internal standards (1,6-hexanediamine, internal<br>
standard amount = 7.5 or 12 nmol) as well as 5% perchloric acid<br>
aqueous solution (5 to 20 mL per 1.0 g live weight of sample)<br>
were added to the samples, which were thoroughly milled and<br>
extracted at ambient temperature in an omnimixer. The milled<br>
solution was centrifuged at 35,000 x g at 4°C for 20 minutes, a<br>
supernatant solution was collected, and the solution was made a<br>
free polyamine solution. The free polyamine solution (400 piL) ,<br>
200 (IL of saturated aqueous solution of sodium carbonate and 200<br>
[iL of dansyl chloride/acetone solution (10 mg/mL) were added into<br>
a microtube with a screw cap, and gently mixed. The cap of the<br>
tube was tightly sealed followed by being covered with aluminium<br>
foil, and the mixture was heated in a water bath at 60°C for one<br>
hour to perform dansylation. After cooling the tube, 200 piL of an<br>
aqueous solution of proline (100 mg/mL) was added and mixed. The<br>
tube was covered with aluminium foil and heated again in the<br>
water bath for 30 minutes. After cooling, acetone was removed by<br>
blowing nitrogen gas, then 600 of toluene was added and mixed<br>
vigorously. The tube was left stand to separate two phases, and<br>
subsequently, 300 to 400 L of an upper layer toluene layer was<br>
dispensed in a microtube. Toluene was completely removed by<br>
blowing the nitrogen gas to the dispensed toluene. The dansylated<br>
free polyamine was dissolved by adding 200 of methanol to the<br>
tube. Putrescine, sperrnidine and free polyamine of spermine were<br>
quantified by an inner standard method using high performance<br>
liquid chromatography connecting a fluorescence detector<br>
(excitation wavelength: 365 run, luminescence wavelength: 510 run).<br>
The HPLC column was a fiBondapak CIS (027324 by Waters, 3.9 x 300<br>
mm, 10 pirn particle diameter). The polyamine content of the<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
samples was calculated by determining the peak area of the<br>
internal standard and each polyamine based on the HPLC chart of<br>
the standard solutions and samples. The results are given in<br>
As is shown in Table 2, it has been demonstrated that the<br>
amounts of putrescine, spermidine and spermine contained in the<br>
cell lines in which FSPD1, FSAM24, FADC76, FSPM5 or OSPD2 which<br>
was the spermidine synthase gene had been introduced in the sense<br>
direction were signi ficantly increased compared with those in the<br>
wild type (WT) and that the amounts of total polyamine contained<br>
were also significantly increased compared with that in the wild<br>
type (WT) . In particular, the amounts of contained spermidine and<br>
spermine were remarkably increased. It has been shown that the<br>
amounts of contained spermidine and spermine were increased in<br>
the range of 1.1 to 3.0 times compared with those in the wild<br>
type (non-transformant) by introducing FSPD1, FSAM24, FADC76,<br>
FSPM5 or OSPD2 into the plant. Adverse effects such as growth<br>
inhibition and fertility reduction were not observed in the<br>
transformants (cell lines) in which the amounts of contained<br>
spermidine and spermine had been increased in the range of 1.1 to<br>
3.0 times compared with those in the wild type (non-transformant).<br>
Example 3: Microarray analysis of transgenic Arabidopsis<br>
3 hornozygous cell lines in which the amounts of contained<br>
spermidine and spermine had been increased in the range of 1.1 to<br>
3.0 times compared with those in the wild type were selected in<br>
the T3 transformants. The seeds from the wild type (WT) and the<br>
T3 homozygous cell lines (TSP-16, OSP-2) were seeded in plastic<br>
pots containing the potting compost (Metromix 250 supplied from<br>
Hyponex Japan). Sufficient water was given to the soil, and the<br>
pots were covered with Saran wrap, to which the cold temperature<br>
treatment (synchronization) was given for 2 days. After the cold<br>
temperature treatment, the pots were transferred to the<br>
cultivation room, and the acclimation for about one week was<br>
performed under the long day condition (22°C, lighten for 16 hours,<br>
50 molsec"'1 PPFD) . After one week, the Saran wrap was<br>
removed, and the cultivation was started under the above long day<br>
condition. On the 50th day (just before internode elongation)<br>
after the start of the cultivation, an overground part and a root<br>
part were separately sampled. Their fresh weights were measured,<br>
and immediately they were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at<br>
-80°C. Total RNA was extracted using TRIZOL reagent (supplied<br>
from G1BCO-BRL) in accordance with its protocol. Furthermore, the<br>
total RNA was purified using RNeasy column (supplied from Qiagen)<br>
in accordance with its protocol. Probes were prepared from 40 fig<br>
of 3 kinds of total RNA (WT, TSP-16, OSP-2). The probes were<br>
prepared using LabelStar Array labeling kit (supplied from<br>
Qiagen) by Cyanine 3-dUTP and Cyanine 5-dUTP in accordance with<br>
its protocol. cDNA array chips (donated by Professor Takayuki<br>
Kawauchi of Nara Institute of Science and Technology Graduate<br>
University) and/or DNA array chips (Arabidopsis supplied from<br>
Agilent Technologies) were used for the array analysis. The array<br>
chips were prehybridized in prehybridization buffer (4*SSC, 1%<br>
BSA, 0.1% SOS) at 37°C for one hour. The array chips were washed<br>
with highly purified Mill! Q water. This manipulation was<br>
repeated twice. Contained water was removed using the plate<br>
centrifuge (1500 rpm, 5 minutes). The array chips were dried in<br>
the incubator set at 65°C for one or more hours. Hybridization<br>
was performed using the probe produced by the LabelStar Array<br>
labeling kit. The array chips were hybridized with hybridization<br>
buffer (4 x SSC, 10 x Denhart solution, 1% BSA, 0.2% SDS, 1 ng/fiL<br>
of poly A, 0.03 .g/(xL of yeast tRNA) containing 35 of the<br>
probe at 60 to 65°C for 17 hours. After the hybridization, the<br>
array chips were washed with washing solutions starting from 1 x<br>
SSC and 0.2% SDS at 65°C to finally 0.2 x SSC at room temperature.<br>
Scanning and data analysis were performed using Scan Array5000<br>
and QuantArray software (supplied from GSI Lumonics) or<br>
ScanArray4000XL (supplied from Packard Biochip Technologies). The<br>
fluorescence value of the negative control was used for the<br>
background, and the background was subtracted from the<br>
fluorescence value of each spot. Either the median normalization<br>
method or the global normalization method was used for the<br>
normalization. In order to increase reliability of the microarray<br>
analysis, the analysis was repeated several times for each array<br>
chip. The stress defense genes whose expression amounts had been<br>
increased (Ratio of expression amount is in the range of 1.5 to<br>

Example 4: Evaluation of stress defense capacity<br>
(1) Evaluation of Osmotic stress Tolerance<br>
The surfaces of seeds of the transformants (TSP-15, 16, 17)<br>
obtained in Example 2 and the wild type (WT: Columbia strain)<br>
were sterilized in the same manner as in section (6) of Example 2.<br>
Germination growth media containing 100 mM and 200 mM sorbitol (1<br>
x MS salt, 10 g/L sucrose, 0.1 g/L myo-inositol, 5% MES, 8 g/L<br>
Phytagar, pH 5.7) was inoculated with the sterilized seeds one at<br>
a time. Inoculation was followed by about 2 days of low<br>
temperature treatment at 4°C, and then by the start of cultivation<br>
at 22°C under conditions involving long days (16 hour long days/8<br>
hour nights). The state of growth after inoculation was monitored,<br>
particularly the state of the growth of plants on germination<br>
growth media during weeks 6 and 10. The results are given in<br>
Figure 2.<br>
Several days following inoculation, TSP-15, 16, and 17<br>
showed improved germination than the wild type (WT) on growth<br>
medium containing 100 mM and 200 mM sorbitol, revealing improved<br>
growth. In week 6 after inoculation, TSP-15, 16, and 17 plants on<br>
medium containing 100 mM and 200 mM sorbitol were larger than the<br>
WT, with significantly less impaired growth. The results for TSP-<br>
17 in particular are given in Figure 2. After week 7 following<br>
inoculation, the plants on TSP-15, 16, and 17 containing 200 mM<br>
sorbitol in particular exhibited far improved growth,<br>
particularly the roots, compared to WT. In week 10 following<br>
inoculation, there were significant differences in both the parts<br>
above ground and the roots. The results for TSP-16 in particular<br>
are given in Figure 2. Some of the WT were found to have yellowed<br>
and died due to impaired growth.<br>
From the above results, it has been demonstrated that the<br>
osmotic stress defense effect can be imparted to the plant by<br>
introducing the spermidine synthase gene (FSPD1, OSPD2).<br>
(2) Evaluation of drought stress tolerance<br>
The transformants (T3 homozygous cell lines) selected from<br>
the transformants (TSP-15, TSP-16) were used. The seeds from the<br>
obtained transformants and the wild type (WT: Columbia strain)<br>
were seeded in plastic pots containing the potting compost,<br>
Metromix (supplied from Hyponex Japan). Inoculation was followed<br>
by about 2 days of low temperature treatment at 4°C, and the pots<br>
were then placed in plastic vats to start cultivation at 23°C<br>
under conditions involving long days (16 hour long days/8 hour<br>
nights). Rosette leaves had fully developed by about week 3 after<br>
inoculation. Individuals characterized by uniform growth at the<br>
time the rosette leaves had fully developed were selected, water<br>
was then fed into the vats to ensure uniform soil moisture, and<br>
water was filled to the middle of the plastic pots. After 5 days,<br>
a constant soil moisture was confirmed, and drought stress<br>
treatment was started (termination of water feed). The state of<br>
growth was monitored immediately after water termination.<br>
Withering from drought stress damage was noted in the wild<br>
type (WT) on day 13 after the start of drought treatment. 50% of<br>
the WT plants had died by Day 14 of drought treatment. Meanwhile,<br>
in the transformants, 20% of the plants died of drought treatment<br>
and higher survival rate than in the WT was shown. By Day 15,<br>
100% of WT withered whereas 30 to 40% of the transformants<br>
survived. The results are given in Figure 3. From the results in<br>
Fig. 3, it has been evidently confirmed that the wild type: WT<br>
(left) withered whereas the transformants: T3 homozygous cell<br>
lines (middle and right) survived.<br>
Two transformants (T3 homozygous cell lines) selected from<br>
the transformant (OSP-2) were used. The seeds from the obtained<br>
two transformants and the wild type (WT: Columbia strain) were<br>
seeded in plastic pots containing the potting compost, Metromix<br>
(supplied from Hyponex Japan). Inoculation was followed by about<br>
2 days of low temperature treatment at 4°C, and the pots were then<br>
placed in plastic vats to start cultivation at 23°C under<br>
conditions involving long days (16 hour long days/8 hour nights).<br>
Rosette leaves had fully developed by about week 4 after<br>
inoculation. Individuals characterized by uniform growth at the<br>
time the rosette leaves had fully developed were selected, water<br>
was then fed into the vats to ensure uniform soil moisture, and<br>
water was filled to the middle of the plastic pots. After 5 days,<br>
a constant soil moisture was confirmed, and drought stress<br>
treatment was started (termination of water feed). The state of<br>
growth was monitored immediately after water termination.<br>
Withering from drought stress damage was noted in the wild<br>
type (WT) on day 14 after the start of drought treatment. 50% of<br>
the WT plants had died by Day 15 of drought treatment. Meanwhile,<br>
in two transformants, 20% of the plants died of drought treatment,<br>
and the higher survival rate than in WT was shown. By Day 18<br>
after the start of the treatment, 100% of WT withered whereas 50%<br>
of the transformants survived. The results are given in Figure 4.<br>
From the results in Fig. 4, it has been evidently confirmed that<br>
the wild type: WT (left) withered whereas the transformants: T3<br>
homozyqous cell lines (middle and right) survived.<br>
From the above results, it has been demonstrated that the<br>
drought: stress defense effect can be imparted to the plant by<br>
introducing the spermidine synthase gene (FSPD1, OSPD2).<br>
(3) Evaluation of Cold stress Tolerance (Freeze Stress Tolerance)<br>
The transformants (T3 homozygous cell lines) selected from<br>
the transformants (TSP-15, TSP-16) were used. The seeds from the<br>
obtained transformants and the wild type (WT: Columbia strain)<br>
were seeded in plastic pots containing the potting compost,<br>
Metromix (supplied from Hyponex Japan). For about 2 days after<br>
seeding, the cold temperature treatment at 4°C was performed,<br>
subsequently the pots was placed in a plastic tray, and the<br>
cultivation was started at 23°C under the long day condition<br>
(lighten for 16 hours and darken for 8 hours). Until about 4<br>
weeks after seeding and until rosette leaves were completely<br>
developed, the plants were grown. At a time point when the<br>
rosette leaves were completely developed, individuals at the same<br>
growth stage were selected, and then transferred to a growth<br>
chamber at -5°C to start the freeze stress treatment. The freeze<br>
stress treatment was performed in a dark phase for 40 hours.<br>
After the treatment, the plants were returned to the room at<br>
ambient temperature at 23°C under the long day condition, and the<br>
state of growth was observed.<br>
From immediately after returning to the ambient temperature,<br>
in the wild type (WT), a submerged state and wilting which were<br>
freeze stress disorders were observed. By Day 5 after returning<br>
to the ambient temperature, all plants withered in WT. Meanwhile,<br>
30 to 40% of the plants survived in the transformants. The<br>
results were given in Fig. 5. From the results in Fig. 5, it has<br>
been evidently confirmed that the wild type: WT (left) withered<br>
whereas the transformants: T3 homozygous cell lines (middle and<br>
right) survived. Similar results were obtained in the cell line<br>
(OSP-2) in which the spermidine synthase gene (OSPD2) derived<br>
from the rice plant had been introduced.<br>
From the above results, it has been demonstrated that the<br>
low temperature stress (freeze stress) defense effect can be<br>
imparted to the plant by introducing the spermidine synthase gene<br>
(SPDS) into the plant.<br>
(4) Evaluation of Salt Stress Tolerance<br>
The surfaces of seeds of the transformants (TSP-16)<br>
obtained in Example 2 and the wild type (WT: Columbia strain)<br>
were sterilized in the same manner as in section (6) of Example 2.<br>
Germination growth medium containing 75 mM NaCl (75 mM NaCl, 1 x<br>
MS salt, 10 g/L sucrose, 0.1 g/L myo-inositol, 5% MES, 5 g/L<br>
Gellan gum, pH 5.7) was inoculated with the sterilized seeds one<br>
at a time. Inoculation was followed by about 2 days of low<br>
temperature treatment at 4°C, and then by the start of cultivation<br>
at 22°C under conditions involving long days (16 hour long days/8<br>
hour nights). In week 6 after inoculation, the extent of plant<br>
growth on the germination growth medium was observed. The results<br>
are given in Figure 6.<br>
From the results in Fig. 6, the remarkable growth<br>
inhibition was observed in WT which was control on the medium<br>
containing 75 mM NaCl, and the entire plant was whitened or<br>
yellowed to stop the growth and wither. Meanwhile, in the<br>
transformants in which the spermidine synthase gene had been<br>
introduced, the growth inhibition was given, but true leaves were<br>
developed and the growth continued as they were although it was<br>
late. Similar results were obtained in the cell line (OSP-2) in<br>
which the spermidine synthase gene (OSPD2) derived from the rice<br>
plant had been introduced.<br>
From the above results, it has been demonstrated that the<br>
salt stress defense effect can be imparted to the plant by<br>
introducing the spermidine synthase gene (SPDS) into the plant.<br>
(5) Evaluation of Herbicide stress Tolerance<br>
The; surfaces of seeds (cell lines: pBI121 (35S-GUS) , TSP-15,<br>
TSP-16, TSA-1, TAD-3) and the wild type (WT: Columbia strain)<br>
were sterilized in the same manner as in section (6) of Example 2.<br>
Germination growth medium containing 2 \iM paraquat (PQ) (2 [M<br>
paraquat, 1 x MS salt, 1C) g/L sucrose, 0.1 g/L myo-inositol, 5%<br>
MES, 5 g/L Gellan gum, pH 5.7) was inoculated with the sterilized<br>
seeds one at a time. Inoculation was followed by about 2 days of<br>
low temperature treatment at 4°C, and then by the start of<br>
cultivation at 22°C under conditions involving long days (16 hour<br>
long days/8 hour nights). The number of germinating individuals<br>
(germination rate) was observed on day 10 after inoculation, and<br>
the number of individuals surviving (survival rate) was observed<br>
on day 20. The results are given in Table 5.<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
The results of Table 5 show that the wild type and vector<br>
control line (pBI121) had extremely low germination and survival<br>
rates as a result of toxicity caused by paraquat, whereas cell<br>
lines TSP-15, TSP-16, TSA-1, TAD-3 which contained polyamine<br>
synthase genes retained high germination and survival rates.<br>
From the above results, it has been demonstrated that the<br>
herbicide stress defense effect can be imparted to the plant by<br>
introducing the polyamine synthases (SPDS, SAMDC, ADC) genes into<br>
the plant.<br>
Exarnp_le_5: Production of transgenic sweet potato<br>
Sweet potato Kokei 14 (donated by Professor Takiko Shimada<br>
at Ishikawa Agricultural College, Agricultural Resource Institute,<br>
hereinafter referred to as "Kokei 14" or "wild type") was grown<br>
and cultivated in a container under usual cultivation management<br>
to collect tens of cane tops (about 5 cm in length) containing<br>
shoot apex. The cane tops were immersed for two minutes in a 300-<br>
ml beaker to which 150ml of ethanol had been added, followed by<br>
dipped for 2 minutes in a beaker to which 150ml of disinfecting<br>
solution (5% sodium hypochlorite, 0.02% Triton X-100) had been<br>
added. Sterilized cane tops were washed with an aqueous<br>
sterilized solution placed in a sterilization beaker. After<br>
washing, about 0.5 mm of tissue containing meristematic tissue<br>
was aseptically removed under stereoscopic microscope. The tissue<br>
was then plated in embryogenic callus induction medium [4F1<br>
plate:LS medium (1.9g/l KN03, 1.65g/l NH4N03, 0.32g/l MgS04-7H20,<br>
0.44g/l CaCl2-2H20, 0.17g/l KH2P04, 22.3mg/l MnS04-4H20, 8.6mg/l<br>
ZnS04-7H20, 0.025mg/l CuS04-5H20, 0.025mg/l CoCl2-6H20, 0.83mg KI,<br>
6.2mg H3F303, 27.8mg FeS04-7H20, 37.3mg/l Na2-EDTA, 100mg/l myoinositol,<br>
0.4mg/l thiamine hydrochloride), Img/L 4-<br>
fluorophenoxyacetic acid(4FA), 30g/L sucrose, 3.2g/l gellan gum,<br>
pH5.8] and then cultured in plant incubators (MLR-350HT, by<br>
Sanyo) under dark condition at 26°C. After one month culture,<br>
embryogenic calli capable of regeneration to plant body were<br>
selected from proliferated tissue. The selected embryogenic calli<br>
were continued to proliferate with transferred to a new 4F1 plate<br>
every month. Agrobacterium was infected as follows. Transformed<br>
Agrobacterium strains, EHA101/pBI35S-FSPDl+/-, EHAl01/pBIC2-<br>
FSPD1+/- (CaMV35S promoter had been replaced with the peroxidase<br>
promoter derived from the horseradish), EHA101/pBl35S-FSAM24+/-,<br>
EHA101/pBIC2-FSAM24+/- (CaMV35S promoter had been replaced with<br>
the peroxidase promoter derived from the horseradish),<br>
EHA101/pBI35S-FADC76+/-, EHA101/pBIC2-FADC76+/- (CaMV35S promoter<br>
had been replaced with the peroxidase promoter derived from the<br>
horseradish) were cultured in LB medium containing 50 mg/L of<br>
kanamycin and 50 mg/L of hygromycin at 27°C for two nights.<br>
Subsequently, about two rice grains of microbial cells were<br>
picked up, suspended in 50 mL of an infection medium (LS medium,<br>
20 mg/L of acetosyringone, 1 mg/L of 4FA, 30 g/L of sucrose, pH<br>
8), and shaken at 26°C at 100 rpm under complete darkness for one<br>
hour. The suspension was transferred to 300-ml sterilized beaker<br>
in which stainless steel basket was placed. The embryogenic calli<br>
which were cultured two to three weeks were placed on the basket<br>
of the beaker for dipping for two minutes. The calli together<br>
with the basket were placed on doubled sterilized filter paper to<br>
remove the excess moisture. The calli were transferred on coculture<br>
medium (4F1A20 plate: LS medium, lmg/1 4FA, 20mg/l 3,5'-<br>
dimethcxy-4x-hydroxy-acetophenone, 30g/l sucrose, 3.2g/l gellari<br>
gum, pH5.8) and co-cultured for three days at 22 °C under dark<br>
condition. The embryogenic calli which were co-cultured for three<br>
days were transferred on the basket of the 300-ml beaker in which<br>
the sterilized stainless basket was placed. A 50 ml of<br>
disinfection solution containing carbenicillin in a final<br>
concentration of 500mg/l in sterilized water was added to the<br>
beaker. The calli was fully washed for several minutes by<br>
anchoring the basket with tweezers. The embryogenic calli<br>
together with the basket were placed in the 300-ml beaker to<br>
which the disinfection solution was added for further washing.<br>
After repeating the same washing procedure, the excess moisture<br>
of the calli was removed on a sterilized filter paper to arrange<br>
and culture the calli in selection (4FlHmCar plate: LS medium,<br>
lmg/1 4FA, 25mg/l hygromycin, 500mg/l carbenicillin, 30g/l<br>
sucrose, 3.2g/l gellan gum, pH5.8) at 26 °C under dark condition.<br>
For selection of the transformed callus, the embryonic callus<br>
cultured for 2 weeks was cultured by transferring to a new<br>
4FlHmCar plate every two weeks. Non-transformed calli turned<br>
brown, but part of transformants were embryogenic calli with pale<br>
yellow.After 60 days of culture on the selection medium, the<br>
transformed embryogenic calli were transferred to somatic cell<br>
embryogenic medium (A4GlHmCar plate: LS medium, 4mg/l ABA, lmg/1<br>
GA3, 25mg/l hygromycin, 500mg/l carbenicillin, 30g/l sucrose,<br>
3.2g/l gellan gum, pH5.8) to culture for two weeks at 26 °C under<br>
weak light, and all long-day condition (30~40/lmol/m'Ys) and then<br>
transferred to plant body forming medium (AO.O5HmCar plate: LS<br>
medium, 0.05mg/l ABA, 25mg/l hygromycin, 500mg/l carbenicillin,<br>
30g/l sucrose, 3.2g/l gellan gum, pH5.8) to sulture in the same<br>
condition. The transformants were transferred to a new A0.05HmCar<br>
plate every two weeks. Since the transformed cells turned green<br>
to form somatic cell embryo derived from embryogenic calli,<br>
somatic cell embryo was transferred to plant grouth medium (OG<br>
plate: LS medium, 30g/l sucrose, 3.2g/l gellan gum, pH5.8) to<br>
form shoot. For the constructs in which FSAM24 and FADC76 had<br>
been controlled by the 35S promoter, the number of obtained<br>
transformants was obviously lower compared with the constructs<br>
controlled by the C2 promoter. Since the SAMDC gene and the ADC<br>
gene which act upstream of the polyamine metabolism largely<br>
affect the polyamine metabolism, when FSAM24 and FADC76 were<br>
controlled the constitutive promoter such as 35S promoter, it was<br>
likely that the excessive or rapid change of the polyamine amount<br>
adversely affected the growth. For the constructs in which FSAM24<br>
and FADC76 had been controlled by the 35S promoter, many<br>
transformants as possible were assured, and among them, the<br>
transformants where the increase of the polyamine amount had been<br>
in the range of 1.1 to 4.0 times which had little or no effect on<br>
the growth and development were selected. The introduced gene was<br>
confirmed and the expression was analyzed for the obtained<br>
transformants. Specifically, to confirm the introduced gene,<br>
genomic DNA was prepared and then analyzed by PCR method arid<br>
Southern hybridization. For the expression of the introduced gene,<br>
RNA was prepared, and then analyzed by Northern hybridization. As<br>
a result, the transformed sweet potatoes (transformants) in which<br>
the objective gene had been introduced and expressed could be<br>
obtained. Furthermore, the expression level and the translation<br>
level were examined in detail by Northern blotting and Western<br>
blotting, and cell lines in which the polyamine synthase gene had<br>
been introduced and the gene was stably expressed or translated<br>
were selected. Cell lines TSP-SS-1, TSP-SS-2, TSP-SS-3, TSP-SS-4,<br>
TSP-SS-5, TSP-SS-6. TSP-SS-7, TSP-CS-1, TSP-CS-3, TSP-CS-4 and<br>
TSP-CS-5 in which FSPD1 was introduced in a sense direction (+)<br>
were selected. TSP-SS-1, TSP-SS-2, TSP-SS-3, TSP-SS-4, TSP-SS-5,<br>
TSP-SS-6 and TSP-SS-7 were cell lines in which CaMV 35S promoter<br>
was introduced. TSP-CS-1, TSP-CS-3, TSP-CS-4 and TSP-CS-5 were<br>
cell lines in which a peroxidase promoter (C2 promoter) derived<br>
from horseradish was introduced. The cell lines, TSA-SS-1, TSASS-<br>
2, TSA-SS-5, TSA-SS-6, TSA-CS-1, TSA-CS-7 and TSA-CS-9 in<br>
which E'SAM24 had been introduced in the sense direction were<br>
selected, TSA-SS-1, TSA-SS-2, TSA-SS-5 and TSA-SS-6 were the cell<br>
lines in which the CaMV35S promoter had been introduced as the<br>
promoter, and TSA-CS-1, TSA-CS-7 and TSA-CS-9 were the cell lines<br>
in which the peroxidase promoter (C2 promoter) derived from the<br>
horseradish had been introduced. The cell lines, TAD-SS-1, TADSS-<br>
2, TAD-SS-4, TAD-CS-1, TAD-CS-8 and TAD-CS-10 in which FADC76<br>
had been introduced in the sense direction were selected, TAD-SS-<br>
1, TAD-SS-2 and TAD-SS-4 were the cell lines in which the CaMV35S<br>
promoter had been introduced as the promoter, and TAD-CS-1, TADCS-<br>
8 and TAD-CS-10 were the cell lines in which the peroxidase<br>
promoter (C2 promoter) derived from the horseradish had been<br>
introduced.<br>
(2) Analysis of polyamine<br>
For the transformed sweet potatoes produced in (1), the<br>
cell lines controlled by the constitutive 35S promoter or the<br>
inducible C2 promoter were selected, and polyamine was analyzed<br>
under non-stress condition. Approximately 0.3 to 0.9 g of young<br>
leaves from the transgenic plants (TSP, TSA, TAD) and the wild<br>
type plants (WT), which were cultivated at the same time, were<br>
sampled, frozen and stored. Dilution internal standard solution<br>
(1, 6-hexanediamine, internal standard content = 7.5 or 12 nmol)<br>
and 5% perchloric acid aqueous solution (5 to 10 mL per 1.0 g<br>
specimen live body weight) were added to the sampled specimen,<br>
and was thoroughly ground down and extracted using an omnimixer<br>
at room temperature. The ground solution was centrifuged at 4°C,<br>
35,000 x g for 20 minutes, and the supernatant was collected and<br>
was taken as the free polyamine solution. Four hundred<br>
microliters of free polyamine solution, 200 of saturated<br>
sodium carbonate aqueous solution, and 200 of dansyl<br>
chloride/acetone solution (10 mg/mL) were added into a microtube<br>
with a screw cap, and lightly mixed. After firmly closing with a<br>
tube stopper and covering with aluminum foil, dansylation was<br>
conducted by heating for 1 hour in a 60°C water bath. After<br>
allowing the tube to cool, 200 [XL of proline aqueous solution<br>
(100 mg/mL) was added and mixed. The tube was covered with<br>
aluminum foil and heated again for 30 minutes in a water bath.<br>
After standing to cool, the acetone was removed by spraying<br>
nitrogen gas, and then 600 (XL of toluene was added and vigorously<br>
mixed. After allowing the tube to stand quietly and separate into<br>
2 phases, 300 [XL of toluene in the upper layer was separated into<br>
a microtube. The toluene was completely removed by spraying<br>
nitrogen gas. 200 (XL of methanol was added to the tube and the<br>
dansylated free polyamine was dissolved. The free polyamine<br>
content of putrescine, spermidine and spermine was assayed by the<br>
internal standard method using high performance liquid<br>
chromatography connected to a fluorescence detector (excitation<br>
wavelength: 365nm • emission wavelength: 510nm) . A (XBondapak<br>
C18 (manufactured by Waters, Co.: 027324, 3.9x300 mm, particle<br>
size 10 urn) was used for the HPLC column. The polyamine content<br>
in the specimens was calculated by deriving the peak areas of the<br>
polyamine and internal standard from the HPLC charts of the<br>
standard solution and specimens. A part of the results is shown<br>
in Table 6.<br>
As is evident in Table 6, it has been demonstrated that the<br>
amounts of contained putrescine, spermidine and spermine were<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
significantly increased and the total amounts of contained<br>
polyamine were also significantly increased in the cell lines<br>
(TSP-SS, TSA-SS and TSD-SS) in which the polyamine synthase gene<br>
(FSPD1, FSAM24 and FADC76) had been introduced in the sense<br>
direction under the control of the 35S promoter and the cell<br>
lines (TSP-CS) in which the gene had been introduced in the sense<br>
direction under the control of the C2 peroxidase promoter<br>
compared with the wild type (WT). Although, in TSA (FSAM24), the<br>
S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (SAMDC) gene largely affects<br>
the polyamine metabolism, the translation level was suppressed<br>
and no excessive increase of contained polyamine was observed<br>
because the SAMDC gene containing all 5'-non-translated region<br>
(uORF) had been introduced into the plant. In TAD (FADC76), the<br>
arginine decarboxylase (ADC) gene also largely affects the<br>
polyamine metabolism as with the SAMDC gene, but the translation<br>
level was suppressed and no excessive increase of contained<br>
polyamine was observed because the ADC gene containing all 5'-<br>
non-translated region (uORF) had been introduced into the plant.<br>
Example 6: Evaluation of stress tolerance of transgenic sweet<br>
potato<br>
(1) Evaluation of salt stress tolerance<br>
The cell lines (TSA-CS-1, TAD-CS-1) were selected in the<br>
transformed cell lines. Stem cuttings from two transformed cell<br>
lines and the wild type (WT) were planted to the growth medium<br>
(MS medium, 20 g/L of sucrose, 3.2 g/L of gellan gum, pH 5.8) in<br>
the presence or absence of high concentration of 150 mM NaCl, and<br>
transferred to the growth chamber (temperature at 25°C, lighten<br>
for 16 hours, 50 punol m"2 s"1 PPFD) to start the salt stress study.<br>
One month after the start of the study, salt stress diseases were<br>
examined. As a result, in the leaves in the wild type (WT), a<br>
yellowing phenomenon which was one of the salt stress diseases<br>
was noticeably observed. Meanwhile, in the leaves in the two<br>
transformed cell lines (TSA-CS-1, TAD-CS-1), the yellowing<br>
phenomenon was not observed at all. A leaf sight of TSA-CS-1 was<br>
shown in Fig. 7. From the above results, it has been shown that<br>
growth disorder due to the salt stress is milder and the<br>
tolerance against the salt stress is remarkably excellent in the<br>
transformants in which the SAMDC gene or the ADC gene was<br>
excessively expressed under the control of the stress/ diseaseinducible<br>
promoter compared with wild type when encountered to<br>
the salt stress for a short period with higher salt concentration<br>
(150 mM) than the usual salt stress condition.<br>
(2) Evaluation of tolerance against moderate environment (low<br>
temperature, weak light) stress<br>
The cell Lines (TSP-SS-1, TSP-SS-2, TSP-SS-4) were selected<br>
in the transformed cell lines. Stem cuttings (15 to 20 per line)<br>
from the three transformed lines and the wild type (WT) were<br>
planted in plastic pots filled with the commercially available<br>
potting compost (Sansan bed soil) to radicate. After radicating,<br>
the plants were cultivated in a closed system glass green house<br>
(temperature at 22 to 25°C, humidity at 55%, natural day length)<br>
for about; one month until the fifth leaf was completely developed.<br>
Thereafter, the plants were transferred to the moderate<br>
environment of 21 to 22°C and light intensity of 40 rno! m2 s~l<br>
PPFD (16 hours day length) , and after 3 months, root tuber<br>
formation was surveyed. A formation rate of the root tubers and a<br>
root sight: upon survey were shown in Figs. 8 and 9, respectively<br>
(fine roots were removed to show the root tubers easily in the<br>
transformants) . In the wild type, the root tuber was not formed<br>
at all. Meanwhile, the root tubers were formed in the<br>
transformants, and the formation rates of the root tubers in<br>
three transformants were 33, 80 and 89%, respectively. In a<br>
reproducibility study in which the plants were cultivated under<br>
the moderate environment of the same condition, the similar<br>
results were obtained. In the wild type, the root tuber was not<br>
formed at all, but the root tubers were formed in the<br>
transformants, and the formation rates of the root tubers were 50<br>
to 83% depending on the cell lines.<br>
(3) Evaluation of tolerance against salt/drought/water stresses<br>
Two cell lines (TSP-SS-1, TSP-SS-4) were selected from the<br>
transformed cell lines. The two transformed cell lines and the<br>
wild type (WT: Kokei 14) were used to perform the cultivation<br>
experiment in the closed system glass green house. Stem cuttings<br>
with one sprout were prepared, and planted in the commercially<br>
available bed soil (Sansan bed soil) to radicate followed by<br>
being grown in the closed system glass green house (temperature<br>
at 23°C/21°C, humidity at 55%, natural day length) until the fifth<br>
leaf was completely developed. Seedlings at the same growth stage<br>
were selected in these seedlings after 3 weeks. Four stems were<br>
planted in each 6 per line of 30 L planters filled with 20 L<br>
potting compost (Sansan bed soil) (2 planters per treatment<br>
group), and cultivated in the closed system glass green house<br>
(set temperature at 23 to 24°C/21 to 22°C, humidity at 55%,<br>
natural day length). As fertilizers, 3.6 g of potassium sulfate<br>
and 13.4 g of Ecolong (14-12-14, 100 day type) per planter were<br>
 (DM-8M supplied from Sansyo) in all planters. Groups were divided<br>
into a non-stress group (control group), a salt stress group and<br>
a drought: stress group, and two planters were given to each group.<br>
In the salt stress group, 80 g of NaCl per 100 L of the potting<br>
compost was mixed with soil all layers when planted, and further<br>
1.5 months after planting, 40 g of NaCl per 100 L of the potting<br>
compost was additionally given. The NaCl concentration was<br>
totally about 21 mmol/L per planter. The salt stress was started<br>
when fix planted. For affusion in the salt stress group and the<br>
control group, pF 2.3 of a soil water suction pressure was an<br>
affusion point, the amount of tap water (1.5 to 6 L/time per<br>
planter) where pF was lowered to a field capacity (pF 1.5) was<br>
given. The drought stress was given by limiting the affusion, and<br>
0.75 to 3 L of water was given to the planter when pF became 2.9.<br>
The drought stress treatment was started one week after fix<br>
planting in consideration of taking roots after fix planting.<br>
About 4 months (harvesting stage) after fix plating, wet weight<br>
of the root tuber and the number of root tubers were surveyed.<br>
For poiyamine analysis, the amounts of free polyamine contained<br>
in the Leaves and the root tubers at the harvest were examined.<br>
The growth (wet; weight) of the underground part (root tubers) by<br>
about 4 months after fix planting and a root sight were shown in<br>
Figs. 10 and 11, respectively. The wet weight of the root tubers<br>
in the transformants was significantly heavier than in the wild<br>
type for the control group, and the root tuber weight per plant<br>
was about 40 g heavier in the transformants than in the wild type.<br>
The wet weight of the root tubers in the transformants was<br>
significantly heavier than in the wild type for the salt stress<br>
group, and the root tuber weight per plant was about 60 g heavier<br>
in the transformants than in the wild type. The wet weight of the<br>
root tubers in the transformants was significantly heavier than<br>
in the wild type for the drought group, and the root tuber weight<br>
pe.r plant was about 30 g heavier in the transformants than in the<br>
wild type. Further, the numbers of the root tubers were shown in<br>
Table b. 'In the transformants, the number of root tubers per<br>
plant was 2 more regardless of the presence and absence of the<br>
stress treatment. It was confirmed that the yield of the root<br>
tubers and the number of root tubers were obviously increased in<br>
the transformants compared with the wild type. Free polyamine in<br>
the leaf and the root tuber was analyzed 2 months after fix<br>
planting and at the harvest. The results at the harvest were<br>
shown in Fig. 12. Particularly, the amounts of spermidine (spd)<br>
contained in the leaf and the root tuber in the transformants<br>
were significantly increased about 2 times compared with the wild<br>
type regardless of the presence or absence of the stress<br>
treatment. Depending on the treatment group, the amounts of<br>
contained putrescine (Put) and spermine (Spm) were also increased.<br>
From the above results, under both non-stress condition and<br>
stress condition, it was shown that the formation of the root<br>
tubers (roots) was improved to increase the root tuber yield and<br>
the number of root tubers by increasing the polyamine level in<br>
the sweet potato. Next, the amount of contained starch which was<br>
a major component of the root tuber was examined. The root tuber<br>
with similar size was selected from each plant, and about 100 to<br>
200 g of a root tuber piece was sampled from a vicinity of a<br>
center of the root tuber. The root tuber piece was cut finely,<br>
and 500 ml, of distilled water was added to pulverize by a blender<br>
mixer for 1.5 minutes. A pulverization solution was filtrated<br>
with a sieve of 75 [m, and a filtrated solution was collected.<br>
The sieve was washed with 500 mL of distilled water and the<br>
filtrate was collected. The filtrated solution was left stand for<br>
several hours to precipitate starch, and a supernatant was<br>
discarded. Subsequently, 500 mL of distilled water was added,<br>
stirred to wash starch, and left stand to precipitate starch<br>
followed by discarding the supernatant. This manipulation was<br>
repeated three times or more to thoroughly wash starch. The<br>
precipitated starch after washing was dried in air at room<br>
temperature for 2 days or more. The dried starch was collected<br>
and weighed to calculate the amount of contained starch per wet<br>
weight and a starch yield (g/plant). As a result, in all<br>
treatment groups, the amount of contained starch per root tuber<br>
wet weight was higher in the transformants than in the wild type,<br>
and particularly, in the drought stress group, the amount of<br>
contained starch in the wild type was 12% whereas that in the<br>
both transformants (TSP-SS-1, TSP-SS-4) was 17% which was high.<br>
The starch yields were 39.6 g/plant in the wild type, 48.3<br>
g/plant in TSP-SS-1 and 49.8 g/plant in TSP-SS-4 in the salt<br>
stress group, as well as 13.8 g/plant in the wild type, 21.1<br>
g/plant in TSP-SS-1 and 21.8 g/plant in TSP-SS-4 in the drought<br>
stress group. In both treatment groups, the starch yield was<br>
higher in the transformants than in the wild type. From the above,<br>
it has been demonstrated that the amount of contained starch<br>
which is the major component of the root tuber and the starch<br>
yield are increased by increasing the polyamine level in the<br>
plant.<br>
According to the present invention, by being capable of<br>
imparting the stress defense effects of the plant, it is possible<br>
to avoid the diseases due to various stresses which the plant<br>
encounters in its growth and development process and reduce the<br>
growth inhibition, it is also possible to anticipate the<br>
stabilization of cultivation, the enhancement of productivity,<br>
the enlargement of cultivation regions and the enlargement of<br>
cultivation periods, and it is anticipated to largely contribute<br>
to the industry. It becomes possible to cultivate the plants in<br>
barren lands and salt accumulated soils, and it can be<br>
anticipated to contribute to the global warming and the food<br>
problem.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
