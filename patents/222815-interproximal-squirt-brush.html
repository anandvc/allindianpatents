"INTERPROXIMAL SQUIRT BRUSH"<br>
â€¢HAN, Johnny, Steve, An American national of   1830 Debann PL, Rowland Heights, CA 91748, U.S.A.<br>
HAN, Mei-Ling, Pauling, An American national of   1830 Debann PL, Rowland Heights, CA 91748, U.S.A.<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
Background of the Present Invention<br>
Field of the Present Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a dental instrument, and more particularly to an interproximal squirt brush, which can substantially clean and remove stains and food      residuals between teeth and around implants by both physical therapy and chemical treatment.<br>
Description of Related Arts<br>
Gum disease (periodontitis) is one of the common dental problems. Periodontal disease, especially in the early stages, is usually not painful such that many people having<br>
        gum disease do not even realize it. Researches report that the periodontal disease is an infection in the gums caused by the bacteria in plaque, wherein plaque and bacterial build up on and between the teeth. To prevent the gum disease, dentists always suggest having a better oral hygiene by brushing and flossing regularly. In addition, mouthwash is also considered as one of the effective methods for removing plaque and bacterial. By<br>
     reducing the amount of plaque on your teeth, you can reduce the amount of bacteria in your mouth.<br>
Brushing method is the most common method for removing plaque built-up on the teeth. However, due to the structure of the toothbrush, the bristles of the toothbrush cannot effectively remove the plaque from the areas between teeth and around the gums. 20 Therefore, flossing becomes the effective way to help the user to remove plaque and debris from between the teeth, especially the areas inaccessible to the toothbrush. It is ideal to use the mouthwash after brushing and/or flossing since the mouthwash with medicament is capable of not only effectively removing oral bacteria and stain on the teeth but also reducing bad breath.<br>
2<br><br>
However, the flossing technique of holding the floss by hand leads to different operational result depending on the users. Flossing requires the user to floss up, down, right, left, front and back. This six-step process is too cumbersome and time consuming. Therefore, the conventional floss is disadvantageous in practical use. An improved   toothpick, which combines the advantages of both toothbrush, floss, and mouthwash, comprises a brush head having a size adapted to fit between the teeth and gum line to brush the areas thereof. Due to the friction between the brush head and the gum line, tenderness during dry brushing always gives discomfort to the user. An improper brushing the gum line may even cause the gum bleeding.<br>
     Summary of the Present Invention<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide an interproximal squirt brush for substantially cleaning and removing stains and/or food residuals between teeth and around implants by both physical therapy and chemical treatment.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an interproximal squirt bush,<br>
      wherein a user is able to use the interproximal squirt brush with mouthwash, which<br>
combines the flossing and mouthwash techniques, in one step to remove oral bacteria<br>
between the gums and teeth, stain and plaque built on the teeth, and to reduce bad breath<br>
at the same time.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an interproximal squirt brush,  wherein the solution is guided to apply on the brush head such that when the brush head fits between the teeth and gum line during brushing process, the solution ont only penetrates through the area between the teeth and around the gum line to remove the stain and bad breath, but also functions as a lubricant to minimize the friction between the brush member and the gum line so as to prevent gum bleed and uncomfortable feeling to  the user. In other words, the solution, such as medicament can be used for the present<br>
3<br><br>
invention to control infection between the gums thus preventing the growth of gum disease.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an interproximal squirt brush, wherein the brush head has a retention portion inserted into an opening of the solution  container to retain the brush head in position such that the solution contained in the solution container can be substantially applied on the brush head by a compression force applied on the solution container. Accordingly, there are additional shapes, animal characters, and sizes for the solution container that can be attached to the brush head, such as the elongating and shrinking brush end.<br>
 	Another object of the present invention is to provide an interproximal squirt brush,<br>
wherein the cleaning operation is easy and simple by fitting the brush head between the teeth and around gum line to brush therewith and by squeezing the solution towards the brush head.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an interproximal squirt brush,<br>
     wherein not only the brush head is replaceably mounted to the solution container but also<br>
the solution can be refilled into the solution container so as to extend the service life span<br>
of the interproximal squirt brush of the present invention. For example, the solution can<br>
be easily replaced by removing a rubber stopper at the bottom of the solution container.<br>

The brush head 20, according to the preferred embodiment, is an interproximal brush arranged to fit between the teeth and around the gum line of the user so as to clean the teeth and massage the gum. As shown in Fig. 1, the brush head 20 is replaceably mounted to the solution container 10 such that the user is able to replace the used brush   head 20 from the solution container 10 with a new brush head 20 by inserting the brush head 20 into the opening 121 of the solution container 10.<br>
The brush arm 21, which is made of bendable material such as metal wire, is a wiring arm wherein the retention portion 212 of the brush arm 21, having a loop shaped, is formed by bending a tail portion of the wiring arm to form a U-shaped structure in such  a manner that when the retention portion 212 of the brush arm 21 is slidably inserted into the opening 121 of the solution container 10, the retention portion 212 of the brush arm 21 is arranged to bias against the inner wall of the nozzle head 12 so as to hold the brush head 20 in position, as shown in Fig. 2.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, a diameter of the opening 121 is slightly smaller than a<br>
      width of the retention portion 212 of the brush arm 21 such that when the retention<br>
portion 212 of the brush arm 21 is inserted into the opening 121 of the solution container<br>
10, the retention portion 212 of the brush arm 21 biases against the inner wall of the<br>
8<br><br>
nozzle head 12 to slightly deform a shape of the nozzle head 12. In other words, the retention portion 212 of the brush arm 21 is arranged to bias against the inner wall of the nozzle head 12 so as to hold the brush head 20 in position, as shown in Fig. 2.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, a diameter of the opening 121 is slightly smaller than a   width of the retention portion 212 of the brush arm 21 such that when the retention portion 212 of the brush arm 21 is inserted into the opening 121 of the solution container 10, the retention portion 212 of the brush arm 21 biases against the inner wall of the nozzle head 12 to slightly deform a shape of the nozzle head 12. In other words, the retention portion 212 of the brush arm 21 provides the urging force as the locking force to  securely retain the brush head 20 in position.<br>
In addition, the dispensing channel 200 is the clearance formed between the retention portion 212 of the brush arm 21 and the inner wall of the nozzle head 12 wherein the dispensing channel 20 is capable of allowing the solution W passing therethrough towards the brush portion 211 of the brush arm 21.<br>
