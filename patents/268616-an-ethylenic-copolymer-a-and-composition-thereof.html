				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
ETHYLENIC COPOLYMER, COMPOSITION CONTAINING THE COPOLYMER AND<br>
USE THEREOF<br>
Technical Field [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to an ethylenic copolymer, a composition containing the copolymer and their use. More specifically, the present invention relates to a novel ethylenic copolymer composed of only ethylene and an α-olefin and having excellent cross-linking properties, a composition containing the copolymer and to use thereof.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0002]<br>
An ethylene-a-olefin copolymer has been conventionally used for various applications.<br>
[0003]<br>
For example, since a crosslinked foamed product using an ethylene-a-olefin copolymer is high in mechanical strength and is lightweight and flexible, it is used for interior and exterior materials for construction, automotive parts such as door glass run  channels  and  the  like,  packaging  materials,  daily<br><br>
necessities, and others. Here, since a non-crosslinked foamed product is weight-reduced but is low in mechanical strength, when it is used for the applications as described above, the mechanical strength has been improved by subjecting a resin to crosslinking reaction to bond molecular chains in the foamed product.<br>
[0004]<br>
In addition, the crosslinked foamed product of a resin is also used for footwears or footwear parts, for example, soles<br>
(mainly, midsoles) of sports shoes or the like. The reason is that it is required for footwears or footwear parts to have a condition in which they are lightweight and have a mechanical strength and rebound resilience high enough to inhibit deformation caused by long-term use and to withstand severe use conditions.<br>
[0005]<br>
It is widely known that crosslinked foamed products of ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers are conventionally used for shoe soles. However, since the crosslinked foamed products, which are molded using the ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer composition, have a high specific gravity and a high compression set, when used, for example, for shoe soles, there is a problem that the soles are heavy and compressed by long-term use and the mechanical strength such as rebound resilience and the like is<br><br>
losing. [0006]<br>
In Patent Documents 1 and 2, there are described inventions, respectively, relating to a crosslinked foamed product using an ethylene-α-olefin copolymer and a crosslinked foamed product using a mixture of an ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer and an ethylene-α-olefin copolymer. However, these inventions improve low specific gravity properties and low compression set properties, but do not provide sufficient performance. In addition, in Patent Document 3, there is described an ethylene-α-olefin-specific non-conjugated polyene random copolymer. However, it becomes clear from the studies of the present inventors that there is a room for improvement from the standpoint of providing a foamed product with consistent quality and having a low specific gravity and a low compression set (CS) . For this reason, there is a demand for the appearance of a foamed product with consistent quality and having a low specific gravity and a low compression set (CS) and an ethylene-α-olef in copolymer and a composition having high crosslinking properties which may be used for the production of the foamed product. [0007]<br>
In addition, the present applicant has proposed a resin composition containing an ethylene-α-olefin copolymer and an ethylenic copolymer rubber (see Patent Document 4).  When the<br>
resin composition is used as a raw material for coating an electric wire, it is disclosed that the resin composition is more excellent in balance between weather resistance and mechanical strength, compared to the case where a copolymer containing an ethylene-propylene-diene rubber is used as a raw material for coating an electric wire (for example, see Patent Document 5). However, a further improvement has been demanded in the balance between weather resistance and mechanical strength when the resin composition is used for wire coating. [0008]<br>
On the other hand, an olefinic thermoplastic elastomer is used for automotive parts, industrial machine parts, electronic and electric device parts, building materials and the like as an alternative of a vulcanized rubber. However, there is a demand for a material having excellent tensile strength, breaking elongation and rubber elasticity. For example, it is known that a molded article having a low-temperature property and tensile strength, which is improved as compared with a conventional vulcanized rubber, is produced by the use of a composition containing a crystalline polyolefin resin and an ethylene-α-olefin-non-conjugated polyene copolymer rubber prepared using a metallocene catalyst (see patent Document 6) . However, there has been a demand for the appearance of a thermoplastic elastomer capable of producing a molded article<br>
that is more excellent in balance between mechanical strength<br>
and toughness such as tensile elongation and the like.<br>

Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
[0029]<br>
Fig.l is a schematic view showing the specific gravity measurement range and five specific gravity measurement sites<br>
(shown by asterisks) on a flat surface of a foamed molded sample. Here, the specific gravity measurement range is set in a range of 20 mm or more inward from each of the four sides of the flat surface of the foamed molded sample.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention [0030]<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be specifically explained. [0031] <ethylenic copolymer><br>
The ethylenic copolymer (A) of the present invention is a copolymer composed of only ethylene and an α-olefin having 3 to 20 carbon atoms and preferably is a copolymer composed of<br>
ethylene and an α-olefin having 3 to 10 carbon atoms. The α-olefin having 3 to 20 carbon atoms, which is a copolymerization component, may be one kind alone, or two or more kinds.<br>
[0032]<br>
The type of the α-olefin constituting the ethylenic copolymer (A) is clear from the type of a copolymerization monomer in producing the ethylenic copolymer (A) . However, the type of the α-olefin in an ethylenic copolymer may be identified, for example, by measuring the 13C-NMR spectra of a sample obtained by uniformly dissolving approximately 200 mg of an ethylenic copolymer in 1 mL of hexachlorobutadiene in a sample tube with a diameter of 10 mm under the measurement conditions of a temperature of 120°C, a frequency of 25.05 MHz, a spectrum width of 1500 Hz, a pulse repeating time of 4.2 seconds and a 45 degree-pulse width of 6 µsec. In the present invention, the ethylene content of the ethylenic copolymer (A) is not particularly limited but is usually 50 to 95% by mole in the total constitutional units.<br>
[0033]<br>
The ethylenic copolymer (A) of the present invention satisfies the following requirements (a) , (b) and (c) , and preferably simultaneously satisfies the following requirements<br>
(a), (b), (c) and (d) .<br>
(a) the vinyl-group content per 1000 carbon atoms is 0.06 to 1,<br>
as measured by infrared absorption spectroscopy,<br>
(b)	the ratio, MFR10/MFRR2.16 is 8.5 or less,<br>
(c)	the density is 0.850 to 0.910 g/cm3, and<br>
(d)	the melt flow rate (MFR, ASTM D1238) at 190°C under a load of 2.16 kg is 0.01 to 200 g/10 min.<br>
[0034]<br>
Hereinafter, these requirements will be further explained.<br>
[0035]<br>
(a) Vinyl-Group Content<br>
The ethylenic copolymer (A) of the present invention has a vinyl-group content from 0.06 to 1, preferably from 0.06 to 0.8, more preferably from 0 . 06 to 0 . 5 and further more preferably from 0 . 06 to 0 . 2 per 1000 carbon atoms . In the present invention, the vinyl-group content in a polymer is determined by infrared absorption spectroscopy (IR method).<br>
[0036]<br>
In the ethylenic copolymer (A), a vinyl group is usually present at the terminal of a copolymer. The ethylenic copolymer<br>
(A) of the present invention is excellent in crosslinking properties because it has a relatively high vinyl-group content, that is, 0.06 to 1 per 1000 carbon atoms. However, if the ethylenic copolymer (A) has a vinyl-group content of 1 or more per 1000 carbon atoms, the vinyl-group amount of a copolymer<br>
becomes excessively large and the crosslinkage or breakage of the polymer main chain easily excessively occurs during the hot molding processing, there may cause problems such as the variation in MFR2.16, burning and the like during the molding processing. [0037]<br>
In addition, in the present specification, the quantification of the vinyl group may be typically performed by (1) preparing a mixed sample using a polyethylene containing neither vinyl type unsaturated bond nor vinylidene type unsaturated bond and 1, 2-polybutadiene (the vinyl-group content of which is already known) and preparing a calibration curve by performing infrared absorption measurements, and then (2) performing infrared absorption measurements for the measurement sample and (3) calculating. Further, it is confirmed that polyethylene contains neither vinyl type unsaturated bond nor vinylidene type unsaturated bond by the fact that no absorption band is observed in the region between 1000 cm-1 and 850 cm-1 by infrared absorption measurements. Specifically, the quantification of the vinyl group was carried out in the following manner using an infrared spectrophotometer FT-IR 350 Type manufactured by JASCO Corporation. [0038]<br>
By using, as standard samples, a powder of polyethylene<br>
 (HI-ZEX 2200J (trade Name), manufactured by Prime Polymer Co., Ltd.) containing neither vinyl type unsaturated bond nor vinylidene type unsaturated bond and 1,2-polybutadiene (double-bond amount of which is already known, BR830, manufactured by JSR Corporation) as a vinyl group type olefin, approximately 5 g of each sample was weighed to the fourth decimal place, and both of the samples were dissolved in chloroform at 23 °C, and then the chloroform was evaporated to obtain a mixed sample. An infrared absorption measuring film was prepared from the mixed sample by hot rolling at 180°C. In addition, the vinyl-group content in BR830 manufactured by JSR Corporation is 93% by mole (by infrared absorption spectroscopy, Molello method), and using this value, the number of vinyl-type double bonds in the 1,2-polybutadiene per 1000 carbon atoms is calculated. Then, samples having the different numbers of vinyl-type double bonds (n: vinyl content per 1000 carbon atoms) , in which the mixing ratio between polyethylene and vinyl type olefin was changed, were subjected to 5-level infrared absorption measurement in the range of n from 0.05 to 1 to obtain a common tangent line at the maximum point in the vicinity of 940 to 850 cm"1. The common tangent line was used as a base line, and the absorbance Ds at the key band (910 cm-1) of the vinyl group and the value D0 of the base line were read out. Further, the thickness L (cm) of each sample was accurately read out by a<br>
micrometer, and the absorbance D/L = (Ds-D0)/L of each sample per the unit thickness of the key band was calculated. Then, a relationship between the absorbance and the number n of the vinyl-type double bonds is graphically represented to obtain a calibration curve for the vinyl-group amount per 1000 carbon atoms.<br>
[0039]<br>
For the sample to be measured, an infrared absorption measuring film was prepared by hot rolling and D/L was determined in the same manner as described above. The calibration curve obtained above was used to calculate the vinyl-group amount per 1000 carbon atoms.<br>
[0040]<br>
(b) MFR10/MFR2,16<br>
The ethylenic copolymer (A) of the present invention has the ratio MFR10/MFR2.16 of 8.5 or less, preferably 8. 0 or less and more preferably 4.0 to 8.0. Here, MFR10 represents a melt flow rate (g/10 min) measured at 190°C under a load of 10 kg in accordance with ASTM D1238, and MFR2.16 represents a melt flow rate (g/10 min) measured at 190°C under a load of 2.16 kg in accordance with ASTM D1238.<br>
[0041]<br>
The ratio MFR10/MFR2.16 is an index of the degree of long chain branching of a copolymer.   If a copolymer has an<br>
MFR10/MFR2.16 value of 8.5 or less, it is represented that the<br>
copolymer has less long chain branching.<br>
[0042]<br>
(c)	Density<br>
The ethylenic copolymer (A) of the present invention has a density from 0.850 to 0.910 g/cm3 and preferably from 0.855 to 0.910 g/cm3.  Further, the density of the ethylenic copolymer<br>
(A) of the present invention is a value measured at 23°C in accordance with ASTM D1505.<br>
[0043]<br>
If the density satisfies the range, the ethylenic copolymer<br>
(A) is excellent in balance between the rigidity and the impact-resistant strength.<br>
[0044]<br>
(d)	MFR<br>
The melt flow rate (MFR, ASTM D1238) at 190°C under a load of 2.16 kg of the ethylenic copolymer (A) of the present invention is appropriately selected depending on the applications and is not particularly limited, but is preferably from 0. 01 to 200 g/10 min, more preferably from 0.1 to 100 g/lOmin, further more preferably from 0.1 to 40 g/10 min, especially preferably from 0.1 to 25 g/10 min and most preferably from 0.1 to 10 g/10 min. [0045] <production method of ethylenic copolymer><br>
Olefin Polymerization Catalyst<br>
The ethylenic copolymer (A) of the present invention has the properties and its production method is not particularly limited. However, the ethylenic copolymer (A) may be produced, for example, by copolymerizing ethylene with one or more kinds selected from α-olefins having 3 to 20 carbon atoms in the presence of an olefin polymerization catalyst comprised of the following catalyst components [A] and [B].<br>

Production of Ethylenic Copolymer (A)<br>
The ethylenic copolymer (A) of the present invention may be suitably produced by copolymerizing ethylene with at least one kind of α-olefin having 3 to 20 carbon atoms in the presence of the olefin polymerization catalyst. The polymerization is not particularly limited, but is preferably carried out by conducting solution polymerization at a temperature range of 0 to 200°C in the presence of a solvent.<br>
[0085]<br>
In the polymerization, the method for using each of the components and the sequence of addition are optionally selected. For example, a method in which the catalyst component (A) and the catalyst component (B) are added to a polymerization reactor in an arbitrary order may be mentioned.<br>
[0086]<br>
In the method, two or more of the respective catalyst components may be brought into contact with each other in advance.<br>
[0087]<br>
When the ethylenic copolymer (A) of the present invention is produced by copolymerization of ethylene and at least one kind of α-olefin having 3 to 20 carbon atoms using the olefin polymerization catalyst as mentioned above, the catalyst component [A] is used in the amount in the range of usually 10-9<br>
to10-1 mol, preferably 10-8 to 10-2 mol per liter of reaction volume.<br>
[0088]<br>
The component (b-1) is used in an amount so that the molar ratio [(b-1)/M] of the component (b-1) to all transition metal atoms (M) in the component (A) is usually 1 to 10000 and preferably 10 to 5000. The component (b-2) is used in an amount so that the molar ratio [(b-2)/M] of the component (b-2) to all transition metal atoms (M) in the component (A) is usually 0.5 to 50 and preferably 1 to 20. The component (b-3) is used in the amount in the range of usually from 0 to 5 mmol and preferably approximately from 0 to 2 mmol per liter of polymerization volume.<br>
[0089]<br>
Here, the feeding molar ratio of ethylene to an α-olefin having 3 to 20 carbon atoms may be appropriately selected depending on the properties of the intended ethylenic copolymer<br>
(A) and is not particularly limited, but is usually from 10:90 to 99.9:0.1, preferably from 30:70 to 99.9:0.1 and more preferably from 50:50 to 95.0:5.0.<br>
[0090]<br>
As the α-olefin having 3 to 20 carbon atoms, there may be mentioned a linear or branched α-olefin, for example, propylene, 1-butene, 2-butene, 1-pentene, 3-methyl-l-butene, 1-hexene,<br>
4-methyl-l-pentene, 3-methyl-l-pentene, 1-octene, 1-decene, 1-dodecene and the like. Among these α-olefins, 1-butene, 1-hexene, 4-methyl-l-pentene and 1-octene are especially preferably used. In the present invention, among these α-olefins, an α-olefin having 3 to 10 carbon atoms is more preferably used. [0091]<br>
The "solution polymerization", which is preferably employed for the production of the ethylenic copolymer (A) , is generally referred to as a process of carrying out polymerization in a state in which a polymer is dissolved in a hydrocarbon solvent that is inert to the copolymerization reaction. In the solution polymerization according to the present invention, the polymerization temperature is usually from 0 to 200°C, preferably from 20 to 190°C and more preferably from 40 to 180°C. [0092]<br>
In the solution polymerization according to the present invention, when the polymerization temperature is less than 0°C, since the polymerization activity is extremely reduced, it is impractical in view of productivity and further the vinyl-group content of the ethylenic copolymer (A) may be decreased. In addition, in the polymerization temperature range of 0°C or higher, as the temperature becomes higher, the solution viscosity during the polymerization is decreased and the removal<br>
of polymerization heat becomes easier and further the vinyl-group content of the ethylenic copolymer (A) is increased. However, if the polymerization temperature exceeds 200°C, the polymerization activity may be extremely reduced. The polymerization pressure is usually from normal pressure to 10 MPa gauge pressure, preferably normal pressure to 8 MPa gauge pressure, and the polymerization reaction may be carried out in any of batch, semi-continuous and continuous processes. The reaction time (when the copolymerization is carried out by a continuous process, mean retention time) varies depending on the conditions such as the catalyst concentration, polymerization temperature and the like and may be appropriately selected, but is usually from one minute to 3 hours, and preferably from 10 minutes to 2 . 5 hours . Further, the polymerization may be carried out at two or more stages which have different reaction conditions. The molecular weight of the resulting ethylenic copolymer (A) may be controlled by changing the hydrogen concentration or the polymerization temperature in the polymerization system, and moreover by the amount of the catalyst component (B) to be used. When hydrogen is added to the polymerization system, the amount is suitably approximately 0.001 to 5000 NL per 1 kg of the ethylenic copolymer to produce. In addition, the vinyl-group content of the resulting ethylenic copolymer (A) may be increased by increasing the polymerization<br>
temperature and by significantly reducing the hydrogen addition amount. Further, the ratio MFR10/MFR2.16 of the resulting ethylenic copolymer (A) becomes an index showing that the smaller the ratio is, the less the long-chain branched structure is. However, in the case of coordination polymerization as shown in the Examples described later, it is considered that the long-chain branched structure in the ethylenic copolymer (A) is generated by reinsertion of the molecular chain (macromonomer) having a terminal vinyl group generated by the (3-dehydrogenation reaction. For this reason, the value of MFR10/MFR2.16 of the ethylenic copolymer (A) may be controlled by increasing or decreasing the ratio of the macromonomer concentration to the ethylene concentration ([macromonomer]/[ethylene]) in the solution. In general, if the ratio [macromonomer]/[ethylene] is high, the amount of long-chain branch in the ethylenic polymer is increased, and if the ratio [macromonomer]/[ethylene] is low, the amount of long-chain branch in the ethylenic polymer is decreased. As the technique of increasing or decreasing the ratio [macromonomer]/[ethylene] in the solution, the following methods [1] to [4] are mentioned. [1] Polymerization Temperature<br>
The lower the polymerization temperature is, the less the (3-dehydrogenation reaction occurs. For this reason, if the polymerization   temperature   is   decreased,   the   ratio<br>
 [macromonomer]/[ethylene] becomes small and the amount of long-chain branch in the ethylenic copolymer is decreased. [2] Polymer Concentration<br>
If the polymer concentration in the solution is decreased, the macromonomer concentration is also relatively decreased and the ratio [macromonomer]/[ethylene] becomes small, and the amount of long-chain branch in the ethylenic copolymer is decreased. [3] Ethylene Conversion Rate<br>
If the ethylene conversion rate is decreased, the ethylene concentration in the solution is increased and the ratio [macromonomer]/[ethylene] becomes small, and the amount of long-chain branch in the ethylenic copolymer is decreased. [4] Solvent Species<br>
If a high boiling point solvent is used as a polymerization solvent, the ethylene concentration in the solution is increased and the ratio [macromonomer]/[ethylene] becomes small, and the amount of long-chain branch in the ethylenic copolymer is decreased. [0093]<br>
In addition, the ratio [macromonomer]/[ethylene] may be increased or decreased and the amount of long-chain branch in the ethylenic polymer may be changed by controlling the chain transfer  reaction  to  Al  except  for  controlling  the<br>
p-dehydrogenation reaction. [0094]<br>
The solvent used in the solution polymerization is usually an inert hydrocarbon solvent and preferably a saturated hydrocarbon solvent having a boiling point of 50 to 200°C under normal pressure. Specific examples of the solvent include an aliphatic hydrocarbon such as pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, decane, dodecane, kerosene and the like; and an alicyclic hydrocarbon such as cyclopentane, cyclohexane, methylcyclopentane and the like. In the category of the "inert hydrocarbon solvents" relating to the high temperature solution polymerization of the present invention, aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylene and the like and a halogenated hydrocarbon such as ethylene chloride, chlorobenzene, dichloromethane and the like are also included, and the use of them is not limited. As described above, in the high temperature solution polymerization according to the present invention, an organoaluminum oxy compound of the aromatic hydrocarbon soluble type which has been generally conventionally used, as well as a modified methyl aluminoxane such as MMAO which is dissolved in aliphatic hydrocarbon and alicyclic hydrocarbon may be used. As a result, if the aliphatic hydrocarbon or the alicyclic hydrocarbon is used as a solvent for solution polymerization, it becomes capable of almost completely eliminating the<br>
probability that the aromatic hydrocarbon is mixed in the polymerization system or in the resulting ethylene polymer. That is, the high temperature solution polymerization method according to the present invention has characteristics capable of reducing the environmental burden and minimizing the impact on human health.<br>
[0095]<br>

The radical generator is used after directly mixing with the product to be modified and the polar monomer, but may be used after dissolving in a small amount of an organic solvent. This organic solvent is not particularly limited for use, as long as it is an organic solvent capable of dissolving the radical generator. [0104]<br>

Among these, carbon dioxide, nitrogen and argon are the most excellent because they are not required to be turned into vapor, inexpensive and unlikely to cause environmental pollution and ignition. [0132]<br>
If the physical foaming agent is used as the foaming agent (D) in the present invention, it leaves no decomposition residue and thus may prevent the mold from contaminating during the crosslinking foaming process of the composition. Moreover, since the physical foaming agent is not powdery, it is excellent in kneadability. In addition, if the physical foaming agent is used, abnormal odor of the resulting foamed product (for example, ammonia odor generated upon decomposition of ADCA) may be prevented from generating. [0133]<br>
Further, in the present invention, the chemical foaming agent may be used as the foaming agent (D) as long as it causes no adverse effect such as odor, mold contamination and the like. These chemical foaming agents may be used alone or in combination with two or more kinds, or in combination with a physical foaming agent and a chemical foaming agent. [0134]<br>
As the storing method of the physical foaming agent, in the case of small-scale production, carbon dioxide, nitrogen and the like may be used in a state where they are stored in a steel bottle and supplied to an injection molding machine, an extrusion molding machine and the like through a pressure reducing valve, or may be pressurized by a pump and the like and to supply to an injection molding machine, an extrusion molding machine and<br>

However, the addition amount of the chemical foaming agent may be appropriately increased or decreased by the intended expansion ratio because the gas volume generated varies depending on the types and grades of the foaming agent used.<br>
[0138]<br>
Further, when a physical foaming agent is used as the foaming agent (D) , the addition amount of the physical foaming agent is appropriately determined depending on the intended expansion ratios, but is in the range of usually from 0.1 to 15 parts by mass and preferably from 0.5 to 10 parts by mass, based on the total 100 parts by mass of the ethylenic copolymer (A) and the ethylene-polar monomer copolymer (Bl). [0139]<br>

The various kinds of additives include those which are well known<br>
as additives capable being added to an olefinic resin. [0141]<br>
The ethylenic copolymer composition (1) of the present invention may be suitably used for various applications, especially for the application of the foaming molding process. [0142] <production of foamed molded article><br>
A foamed molded article of the present invention may be produced by subjecting the ethylenic copolymer composition (1) to foaming molding, and preferably, may be produced by subjecting an ethylenic copolymer composition (1) containing the radical generator (C) and the foaming agent (D) to crosslinking foaming molding. [0143]<br>
The ethylenic copolymer composition (1) used for producing a foamed molded article is in an non-crosslinked and unfoamed state and may be in a melted state or may be a pellet or sheet which is cooled and solidified. [0144]<br>
When the foamed molded article is produced by using a pellet of the ethylenic copolymer composition (1), the pellet is prepared using a granulator by mixing the ethylenic copolymer (A) and ethylene-polar monomer copolymer (Bl), as well as each of a component such as the radical generator (C), the foaming<br>
agent (D), other additives and the like in the proportion with the use of a Henschel mixer; melting and plasticizing the mixture with the use of a kneader such as a Banbury mixer, a roller, an extruder and the like at a temperature where the radical generator (C) and/or the foaming agent (D) may not be decomposed; and homogeneously mixing and dispersing the resulting mixture. [0145]<br>
As the method for producing a foamed molded article by crosslinking foaming, there may be mentioned, for example, crosslinking by heat treatment and ionizing radiation crosslinking. In the case of the crosslinking by heat treatment, the ethylenic copolymer composition (1) preferably contains the radical generator (C) and the auxiliary crosslinking agent. In addition, in the case of the ionizing radiation crosslinking, the ethylenic copolymer composition (1) preferably contains the auxiliary crosslinking agent. [0146]<br>
A foamed molded article of the present invention may contain various kinds of additives such as filler, heat stabilizer, weather stabilizer, flame retardant, hydrochloric acid absorbent, pigment and the like, if needed, as long as the objects of the invention are not impaired. These additives may be contained in the ethylenic copolymer composition (1) in advance, and may be added and used during the production of the<br>
foamed molded article. [0147]<br>
In addition, when the foamed molded article is produced using a sheet of the ethylenic copolymer composition (1), the sheet may be prepared, for example, by feeding the pellet obtained as mentioned above to an extruder or a calendar molding machine. Further, an expandable sheet in a non-crosslinked and unfoamed state may be prepared by a method in which each of the components constituting the ethylenic copolymer composition (1) are kneaded by a blender and the like, and then the resultant is molded into a sheet by a calendar roll or is made into a sheet by a press molding machine, or by a method in which the pellet is kneaded by an extruder, and then the resultant is made into a sheet by passing through a T-die or a cyclic die. [0148]<br>
The foamed molded article of the present invention may be non-crosslinked or crosslinked and the production method is not particularly limited, but it may be produced, for example, by the following methods. [0149]<br>
For example, when the foamed molded article is produced using the expandable sheet, a sheet of the ethylenic copolymer composition (1) obtained as mentioned above may be obtained using a calendar molding machine, a press molding machine or a T-die<br>
extruder. Preferably, a sheet of the ethylenic copolymer composition (1) may be obtained using a calendar molding machine, a press molding machine or a T-die extruder. During the molding of the sheet, when the ethylenic copolymer composition (1) contains the radical generator (C) and the foaming agent (D) , the sheet is preferably molded at their decomposition temperature or less, and specifically, the sheet is preferably molded by setting the condition that the temperature at which the components constituting the ethylenic copolymer composition<br>
(1) is in a melted state, is 100 to 1300C, for example.<br>
[0150]<br>
In exemplifying a method for producing a primary foamed product from the sheet obtained by the method, for example, the sheet is cut into a volume of 1.0 to 1.2 times the volume of a mold, and placed in the mold maintained at 130 to 200°C. A primary foamed product (non-crosslinked or crosslinked foamed product) is produced under the conditions that the mold clamping pressure is, for example, 30 to 300 kgf/cm2 and the holding time is 10 to 90 minutes.   That is, a foamed molded article<br>
(non-crosslinked or crosslinked foamed product) is produced by heat treatment. In addition, the holding time may be increased or decreased accordingly beyond the range because it is dependent on the thickness of the mold.<br>
[0151]<br>
A mold for the (crosslinked) foamed product is not particularly limited in shape, but a mold having a shape suitable for producing sheets is usually used. This mold preferably has a completely closed structure so that the melted resin and the gas generated during the decomposition of the foaming agent may not escape. Further, the mold form preferably has a taper on the inner surface from the viewpoint of the releasability of the resin.<br>
[0152]<br>
In addition to the methods, the foamed molded article of the present invention may be produced by an extrusion foaming method in which for example, the ethylenic copolymer composition<br>
(1) is extruded from an extruder and is foamed simultaneously when it is opened into the atmosphere. That is, a foamed product may be produced by heat treatment.<br>
[0153]<br>
Further, there may be mentioned a method (injection foaming method) of injecting the ethylenic copolymer composition (1), preferably an ethylenic copolymer composition (1) containing the radical foaming agent (C) and the foaming agent (D) into a mold at the decomposition temperature or less of the radical generator<br>
(C) and the foaming agent (D) , and maintaining at a temperature, for example, of approximately from 130 to 200°C in the mold and crosslinking foaming of the resulting mixture.  That is, a foamed<br>
product may be produced by heat treatment. [0154]<br>
It is also preferable that a predetermined shape is given to the primary foamed product obtained by the method by compression molding. The compression molding conditions at this time are such that the mold temperature is in the range of 130 to 200 °C, the clamping pressure is in the range of 30 to 300 kgf/cm2, the compression time is in the range of 5 to 60 minutes and the compression ratio is in the range of 1.1 to 3.0 and preferably 1.3 to 2. [0155]<br>
In addition, in order to obtain a crosslinked foamed product by a crosslinking method by ionizing irradiation, first, the ethylenic copolymer composition (1), preferably an ethylenic copolymer composition (1) containing an organic thermally decomposable foaming agent is melt-kneaded at a temperature lower than the decomposition temperature of the foaming agent (D), and the resulting kneaded product is molded into a sheet shape to obtain a foamed sheet. [0156]<br>
Next, the resulting foamed sheet is irradiated with a predetermined dose of ionizing radiation to crosslink, and then the resulting crosslinked foamed sheet is heated at the decomposition temperature or higher of the organic thermally<br>
decomposable foaming agent to obtain a crosslinked foamed product in a sheet state.  That is, a foamed product may be produced by heat treatment. [0157]<br>
As the ionizing radiation, an α-ray, ß-ray, -ray, electron beam, neutron beam, X-ray or the like are used. Among these, the -ray of cobalt-60 and the electron beam are preferably used. [0158]<br>
The product shape of the foamed product includes, for example, a sheet shape, a thick board shape, a net shape, a molded shape and the like. [0159]<br>
A secondary foamed product may be produced by giving a predetermined shape to the crosslinked foamed product obtained as mentioned above by compression molding. An example of the compression molding conditions at this time is that the mold temperature is in the range of 130 to 200°C, the clamping pressure is in the range of 30 to 300 kgf/cm2, the compression time is in the range of 5 to 60 minutes and the compression ratio is in the range of 1.1 to 3.0. [0160]<br>
Among the production methods above, a foamed molded article is preferably obtained by heat treating the ethylenic copolymer composition (1) or preferably an ethylenic copolymer composition<br>
 (1) containing the radical generator (C) and the foaming agent<br>
(D) .<br>
[0161]<br>
Further, a foamed molded article of the present invention preferably has a specific gravity of 0 . 03 to 0 . 30 . In addition, the compression set (CS, %) and specific gravity (d) of the foamed molded article of the present invention are not particularly<br>
limited, but preferably satisfy the requirement, CS≤-279x(d) + 95 in view of capable of providing a foamed molded article which is light weight and has a small compression set. Since such a foamed molded article has a good stress relaxation for compression and is suitable for the application requiring sag resistance, it is preferably used for the laminated product, footwears or footwear parts which are described later. Further, the lower limit of the CS value is not particularly limited, but for example, a preferred embodiment is that the CS value is 10% or more and preferably 25% or more. [0162] <laminated product and footwear part><br>
The foamed molded article of the present invention is also preferably a laminated product in which the foamed molded article is laminated with other raw materials or the foamed molded articles of the present invention are laminated with each other. The foamed molded article of the present invention, which is a<br>
laminated product, is preferably a laminated product having a layer composed of the foamed molded article (non-crosslinked or crosslinked foamed product) of the present invention and a layer composed of at least one material selected from the group consisting of polyolefin, polyurethane, rubber, leather and artificial leather, which are described above. [0163]<br>
As the other material constituting a laminated product, preferably one kind of material selected from the group consisting of polyolefin, polyurethane, rubber, leather and artificial leather, a well-known one may be used without any particular limitation. Such a laminated product is especially suitable for footwear parts. [0164]<br>
The footwear parts includes, for example, shoe soles, midsoles, innersoles, soles, sandals and the like. [0165]<br>
Since the footwears and footwear parts according to the present invention use the foamed molded article of the present invention or the foamed molded article of the present invention which is a laminated product, they are lightweight and may suppress the deformation caused by long-term use.

the like may be added if necessary in an arbitrary stage. [0198]<br>
The ethylenic resin composition (2) according to the present invention has excellent crossliniking properties and excellent flexibility and is more excellent in elongation properties and hue than a common single EPDM, because the ethylenic copolymer (A) , which is a component of the ethylenic copolymer composition (2), contains a relatively large number of vinyl groups.

[0225]<br>
Uses of Thermoplastic Elastomer Composition<br>
The thermoplastic elastomer composition of the present invention may be used for various applications without having any restrictions. For example, in a molded article produced from a conventional EPDM, a cost saving may be realized by using the thermoplastic elastomer composition instead of EPDM. In addition, the thermoplastic elastomer composition of the present invention is most suitably molded to use as automotive interior parts or automotive exterior parts.  The automotive interior and<br>
exterior parts obtained from the thermoplastic elastomer composition of the present invention are usually produced according to the following conventional methods.<br>
(1)	The thermoplastic elastomer composition is fed into<br>
a plastic processing machine such as extrusion molding machine<br>
equipped with a T-die, a calendar molding machine and the like,<br>
followed by to mold into a desired shape, for example, a sheet<br>
shape and the like.<br>
(2)	The thermoplastic elastomer composition is molded into<br>
a desired shape by injection molding.<br>
[0226]<br>
The automotive interior and exterior parts thus obtained may contain, for example, 1 to 200 parts by mass of an olefinic resin based on 100 parts by mass of the olefinic thermoplastic elastomer composition. The olefinic resin used here is not particularly limited, but low density polyethylene, linear low density polyethylene, polypropylene, propylene-ethylene block copolymer, polybutene-1, crystalline ethylene-α-olefin copolymer (for example, ethylene-4-methyl-l-pentene random copolymer) and the like are preferable. [0227]<br>
In addition, on the top surface layer of the automotive interior parts obtained from the thermoplastic elastomer composition of the present invention, a surface layer composed<br>
of at least one compound selected from polyurethane, saturated polyester, acrylic ester resin, polyvinyl chloride and isocyanate resin may be provided. As the saturated polyester used to form such a surface layer, polyethylene terephthalate, polybutylene terephthalate and derivatives thereof, and the like are used. As the acrylic ester resin, polymethyl (meth) acrylate, polyisobutyl(meth)acrylate, poly-2-ethylhexyl(meth)acrylate and the like are used. Further, as the isocyanate resin, polyhexamethylene diisocyanate, polyisophorone diisocyanate and the like are used. [0228]<br>
Such a surface layer preferably has a thickness of 300 urn or less . A primer layer may be interposed between the top surface layer and such a surface layer. Further, the automotive interior and exterior parts obtained from the thermoplastic elastomer composition of the present invention may constitute a laminated product with a polyolefin foamed product or a laminated product with a polyolefin resin. As the polyolefin used here, polyethylene, polypropylene and the like are preferred. [0229]<br>
Such a laminate is produced, for example, by extruding the olefinic thermoplastic elastomer composition by an extruder equipped a T-die and then passing the extruded sheet-like thermoplastic elastomer composition in a melted state through<br>
a pair of rolls in a condition in which it is laminated with a polyolefin foamed product sheet, or by the sequential injection molding of a polyolefin resin and an olefinic thermoplastic elastomer. Such automotive interior parts include, for example, a top surface layer and the like of a door trim, instrumental panel, ceiling, steering wheel, console box, seat sheet and the like. Examples<br>

Hereinafter, the present invention will be explained in more detail with reference to Examples, but it should be construed that the present invention is in no way limited to these Examples.<br>
[0231]<br>
In the following Examples and Comparative Examples, physical properties were measured or evaluated in the following manners.<br>
[0232]<br>
[Physical Properties Evaluation of Copolymer] Density<br>
The density was determined at 23°C in accordance with ASTM D1505.<br>
[0233] MFR<br>
The MFR was determined at 190°C in accordance with ASTM D1238. The measurement value obtained under a load of 2.16 kg was defined as MFR2.16 and the measurement value obtained under a load of 10 kg was defined as MFR10.<br>
[0234] Molecular Weight Distribution (Mw/Mn)<br>
The molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn) was determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) at 140°C using o-dichlorobenzene as the solvent. The measurement was made by using Gel Permeation Chromatography Alliance GPC-2000 Model manufactured by Waters Corporation in the following manners. Two columns of TSK gel GNH6-HT and two columns of TSK gel GNH6-HTL<br>
(each 7.5 mm in diameter and 300 mm in length) were used, the column temperature was set at 140°C, the mobile phase was o-dichlorobenzene (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. ) containing 0.025% by mass of BHT (Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited) as an antioxidant, the flow rate was 1.0 mL/min, the sample concentration was 15 mg/10 mL, the sample injection volume was 500 uL, and a differential refractometer was used as a detector. Standard polystyrenes manufactured by Toso Corporation, Ltd. were used for Mw4x106 and those manufactured by Pressure Chemical Company were used for l000≤Mw ≤4xl06.<br>
[0235]<br>
 [Physical Properties Evaluation of Foamed Molded Article] Specific Gravity<br>
The specific gravity was measured in accordance with JIS K7222. If a foamed product is a cube, the sampling was made from the site which was cut from 20 mm or more inside from each of the four sides of a flat surface of the maximum area and the site which was 2.5 mm or more cut from the surface of the parallel flat surface. In addition, even when the foamed product to be sampled is a cube having various shapes, a sample was prepared from the site which was cut from 20 mm or more inside from each of the ends (side surfaces) and 2.5 mm or more from the surface of the upper and lower surfaces by setting the surface showing the maximum area of the molded article to the upper surface and setting the surface located at the opposite side of the upper surface to the lower surface sandwiching the molded product between the surfaces. [0236]<br>
For example, in the case of a midsole, a sample was prepared from the site which was cut 20 mm or more inside from each of the ends and 2. 5 mm or more from the both surfaces of the roughly parallel flat surface. [0237]<br>
The measurement is taken as the average of five sites of a molded product.  In addition, the difference between the<br>
maximum and the minimum measurement values of the specific gravity at the five sites, which is a measure of the uniformity of quality of a molded product, is preferably 0.08 or less and more preferably 0 . 06 or less . If the range exceeds 0 . 08, it means that the quality of the molded product (hardness, mechanical properties, compression set and the like) is not constant. The five sites to be measured are shown in Fig.l. [0238] Compression Set (CS)<br>
The compression set (CS) was measured in accordance with JIS K6262 . A foamed product was cut out into a cylindrical shape having a diameter of 30 mm and a length of 15 mm or more, and then each of two parallel flat surfaces of the cylinder was cut off 2.5 mm or more from the surface of the parallel flat surface to use as a sample having a thickness of 10 mm. [0239]<br>
In addition, even when a foamed product to be sampled is a cube having various shapes, the foamed product was cut out into a cylindrical shape having a diameter of 30 mm and a length of 15 mm or more, and then each of two parallel flat surfaces of the cylinder was cut off 2. 5 mm or more from the surface of the parallel flat surface to use as a sample having a thickness of 10 mm. [0240]<br>
In order to cut out from a molded product to a cylindrical shape or cut off a molded product from the surface of a parallel flat surface, a  cylindrical cutter may be employed. [0241]<br>
The sample was compressed by 50%, left to stand at 50°C environment for 6 hours, and the compression set was measured 30 minutes after the sample was released from the compression. The compression set (CS) was calculated from the following equation. [0242]<br>

The tear strength was measured under an environment at 23 °C in accordance with ASTM D3574.  A tear tester is used as the<br>
testing machine and the tear speed is set at 100 mm/min.  The tear strength Tr (N/mm) was calculated from the following equation. [0244]<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>

Production of Ethylene-1-Butene Copolymer 0<br>
Copolymerization of ethylene and 1-butene was carried out continuously at a polymerization temperature of 110°C by using a stainless steel polymerization vessel (stirring rotation number=500 rpm) having a substantial internal volume of 1 L and a stirring blade in a completely filled state. The copolymerization reaction was carried out by continuously supplying hexane at 1.32 L/h, ethylene at 56 g/h, 1-butene at 210 g/h, hydrogen at 0.1 NL/h, bis(p-tolyl)methylene(cyclopentadienyl)<br>
(1,1,4,4,7,7,10,10-octamethyl-l,2,3,4,7,8,9,10-octahydrodi benzo(b,h)-fluorenyl)zirconium dichloride at 0.00035 mmol/h, a tailor made methylaluminoxane/hexane solution (Trade name: TMAO-341) manufactured by Toso Finechem Corporation at 0.18 mmol/h in terms of aluminum and triisobutylaluminum at 1.0 mmol/h from the side of the polymerization vessel to the liquid phase, so that the polymerization pressure was maintained at 3.8 MPaG. Further, a hexane solution of the continuously obtained ethylene-1-butene copolymer was stored in a holding drum, and methanol was added to the solution at 0.2 mL/h as a catalyst deactivating agent to terminate the polymerization. [0317]<br>
The hexane solution of the resulting ethylene-1-butene copolymer was taken out every one hour and the polymer was precipitated from the polymerization solution in 2L of methanol, and the precipitate was dried at 130°C for 10 hours under vacuum to obtain an ethylene-1-butene copolymer 0. [0318]<br>
The ethylene-1-butene copolymer 0 as obtained above was obtained at a yield of 62.0 g/h, and had a density of 0.860 g/cm3 and an MFR (load of 2.16 kg at 190°C) of 0.48 g/10 min, an Mw/Mn of 2.1, an MFR10/MFR2.16 of 6.5 and a content of vinyl groups of 0.06 per 1000 carbon atoms. [0319]<br>
[Comparative Example 14] Preparation of Catalyst Solution<br>
Into a glass flask fully purged with nitrogen gas, 0.63 mg of bis(1,3-dimethylcyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride was added, and 1.57 mL of a toluene solution of methylaminoxane (AL; 0.13 mmol/L) and 2.43 mL of toluene were further added to obtain a catalyst solution. [0320] Production of Ethylene-1-Butene Copolymer P<br>
The atmosphere in a stainless steel autoclave having a substantial internal volume of 2 L was fully replaced with nitrogen and then the autoclave was charged with 912 mL of<br>
hexane, 320 mL of 1-butene and 0 mL of hydrogen and the temperature in the system was increased to 80°C. Subsequently, polymerization was started by injecting 0.9 mmol of triisobutylaluminum and 2 . 0 mL of the catalyst solution (0.0005 mmol as Zr) as prepared above into the system with ethylene. Thereafter, the total pressure therein was kept at 8 . 0 kg/cm2-G by continuous supply of ethylene so as to perform the polymerization at 80°C for 30 minutes. [0321]<br>
The polymerization was stopped by adding a small amount of ethanol to the system, and then unreacted ethylene was purged. The resulting polymer solution was immersed in a largely excessive amount of methanol to precipitate a polymer. The polymer was recovered by filtration, and the filtered polymer was dried overnight under a reduced pressure to obtain an ethylene-1-butene copolymer P. [0322]<br>
The ethylene-1-butene copolymer P as obtained above had a density of 0.861 g/cm3 and an MFR (load of 2.16 kg at 190 °C) of 0.50 g/10 min, an Mw/Mn of 2.0, an MFR10/MFR2.16 of 6.0 and a content of vinyl groups of 0.05 per 1000 carbon atoms. [0323] [Example 12]<br>
