				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
PHARMACEUTICAL AGENT COMPRISING A BENZAMIDE •<br>
DERIVATIVE AS ACTIVE INGREDIENT Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition and in particular to a pharmaceutical formulations comprising as an active ingredient a benzamide derivative or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof/ that is useful as a pharmaceutical agent, in particular an anticancer agent. Background Art<br>
Benzamide derivatives or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof according to the present invention have an ability of inhibiting histone deacetylating enzymes and of inducing differentiation, and are useful as therapeutic or ameliorating agents for diseases that are involved in cellular growth such as malignant tumors, autoimmune diseases, skin diseases, infections, blood vessel diseases, allergic diseases, gastrointestinal disorders, hormonal diseases, diabetes mellitus, and the like, enhancers of the effect of gene therapy, or immunosuppressants.  In particular, they are effective as anti-tumor agents and are effective against hematopoietic organ tumors and solid tumors (Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 10-152462),<br>
However, though the benzamide derivatives and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof of the present invention are stable per se, they become unstable .and decompose markedly over time when combined with additives such as light silicic acid anhydride, lactose, corn   • . starch, carboxymethyl cellulose, magnesium alminate metasilicate, titanium oxide, polyethylene glycols and polysorbates that are commonly used in order to produce dosage forms suitable for oral, percutaneous, or tissue administration. "<br>
Furthermore, when they are formulated into tablets<br>
by the wet granulation, the most common granulation method of preparing solid formulations, they become further unstable and yield, in large quantities/ decomposed products different from simple hydrolyzates, resulting in pharmaceutical formulations in which the ratio of an active ingredient is as low as about 0.001 to 25%, which noticeably decompose, and therefore which are unsuitable as pharmaceutical solid formulations to be provided as medical drugs.  Also, pharmaceutical formulations that employ ingredients commonly used for liquids such as polysorbates, polyethylene glycols, and glycerin were unstable.  Thus it was difficult to use, as medical drugs, pharmaceutical formulations that contain a benzaroide derivative or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof at about 0.001 to 25% as an active ingredient. Disclosure of Invention<br>
The present invention is intended to enhance the stability of compositions containing as an active ingredient a pharmaceutically useful benzamide derivative or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and to effectively use them as a pharmaceutical formulation.<br>
In order to solve the above problems, intensive research was conducted on the effects of temperature, humidity, and physicochemical properties on the solutions, powders, and solid shaped products to which a benzamide derivative or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof has been added.  As a result, the inventors have found that the problem of instability of an active ingredient can be solved and stable and excellent pharmaceutical formulations can be produced by using selectively, among the additives commonly used for pharmaceutical formulations, those additives that do not easily induce decomposition of benzamide derivatives, adding an organic acid salt, an amino compound and an inorganic basic substance, and the like as a stabilizer, producing using the dry granulation or adjusting pH in<br>
the range of 4 to 12, preferably in the range of pH 7 to 11, and thereby have completed the present invention. Thus, the present invention relates to [1] a pharmaceutical formulation comprising a benzamide derivative represented by the formula (1):<br><br>

Example 1.<br>
Compound 1 (1 g) was mixed with 1 g each of D-mannitol, partly pregelatinized starch, carmellose calcium, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, magnesium stearate, and talc to prepare a powder formulation.  Similarly, lactose, corn starch, crystalline cellulose, carmellose, light-weight silicic acid anhydride, magnesium aluminum metasilicate, and titanium oxide were mixed to prepare a comparative control sample.  After these formulations were stored at an air-tight condition at 60°C for 4 weeks and at an open condition at 40°C and at a relative humidity of 75% for 3 months, they were subjected to HPLC analysis.  The percentage (%) of degradation products relative to the active ingredient was shown in Table 1.  The powder formulation prepared by mixing 1:1 with D-mannitol, partially gelatinized starch, carmellose calcium, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, magnesium stearate or talc was stable.<br>
