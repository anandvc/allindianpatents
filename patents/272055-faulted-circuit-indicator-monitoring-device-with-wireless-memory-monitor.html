MEMORY MONITOR<br>
Inventors: Douglas A. Park. Witold R. Teller, Donald C. Hicks. Luther S. Anderson. Steven A. McMahon<br>
Cross-Reference to Related Applications<br>
[001]	This application claims benefit under 35 U.S.C. ยง 119(e) of United States<br>
Provisional Application entitled "FAULTED CIRCUIT INDICATOR WITH WIRELESS MEMORY MONITOR," filed on May 19, 2006 having serial number 60/802,218, naming Douglas A. Park, Witold Teller, Donald C. Hicks, Luther S. Anderson, and Steven A. McMahon as inventors, the complete disclosure thereof being incorporated by reference.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[002]	The present invention relates generally to systems, methods and<br>
apparatuses for wirelessly interfacing with a power system protection, control, or measuring device, and more particularly to systems, methods and apparatus<br><br>
for wirelessly viewing and modifying memory locations within a power system protection, control, or measuring device.<br>
Description of the Prior Art<br>
[003]	Power transmission and distribution systems may include power system<br>
protection, monitoring, and control devices such as protective relays, faulted circuit indicators, and the like. Throughout, the term "power system device" will include any power system protection, monitoring, or control device. Faulted circuit indicators (FCIs) play a vital role in detecting and indicating faults and locations of faulted conductors to decrease the duration of power outages and improve the reliability of power systems throughout the world. Electrical utilities depend on faulted circuit indicators to help their employees quickly locate faulted conductors. Most conventional faulted circuit indicators utilize a mechanical target or an LED to provide a visual indication of a faulted conductor. By visually scanning faulted circuit indicators located at a site, an electrical utility crew can quickly locate a fault. Industry statistics indicate that faulted circuit indicators reduce fault location time by 50% - 60% versus the use of manual techniques, such as the "refuse and sectionalize" method. Nonetheless, electrical utilities still spend substantial amounts of time and money determining the locations of faults on their networks.<br>
[004]	Electrical utilities rely on a number of additional techniques to further<br>
decrease time spent locating faults. For instance, modern faulted circuit<br><br>
indicators frequently have one or more contact outputs that activate on the detection of a fault. These contact outputs can be connected to a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition ("SCADA") system, allowing remote monitoring of a given faulted circuit indicator's status. This technique works well for above-ground sites, where a cable from the faulted circuit indicator to a monitoring device can be installed, and the monitoring device can be connected to a remote site by a communications line. However, this technique is expensive for underground sites, where an underground communications fine must be installed.<br>
[005]	Another recent advancement is the use of radio frequency ("RF")<br>
technology within fault circuit indication systems. In one prior art system, each faulted circuit indicator contains a two-way radio that communicates the occurrence of a fault to an intelligent module installed within 100 feet of the faulted circuit indicator. The intelligent module then uses the existing telephone network to communicate a fault occurrence to a remote site, triggering the dispatch of a team to the fault site. However, this system is vulnerable to phone network outages, in addition, a crew dispatched to the fault site must then monitor a readout located on the intelligent module to ensure that the fault has been properly cleared. As the Intelligent modules are frequently located on power line poles, viewing an intelligent module's readout may be inconvenient.<br>
[006]	An improvement on this system is the use of a wireless device to monitor<br>
radio signals from RF equipped faulted circuit indicators. Using a wireless<br><br>
device, a utility crew can quickly locate a fault and determine when the fault has been properly cleared by monitoring the display of the wireless device.<br>
[007]	The technology within faulted circuit indicators has also improved.<br>
Primitive electromechanical units gave way to more sophisticated analog electronic units, which have given way to microprocessor driven units. Modern faulted circuit indicators utilize sophisticated algorithms both to detect faults and conserve battery life. In addition, faulted circuit indicators may be connected to other "monitoring" units which also use microprocessor based algorithms. However, as more sophisticated microprocessor based algorithms have been introduced, problems with the implementation of the algorithms have escaped detection until deployment in the field. Therefore, methods to troubfeshoot defects in the field have become more important.<br>
[008]	The traditional way to troubleshoot a microprocessor based device is<br>
through the use of a debugger. A debugger is a program that runs concurrently with another program and monitors the other program. Simple debuggers allow the user to stop execution of the embedded software and view and manipulate memory locations. More sophisticated debuggers allow a user to stop execution of the monitored program at a desired time, say at the execution of a particular instruction or the occurrence of a particular condition, and monitor the status of the computer on which the program is running. Status information may include the contents of memory, the status of microprocessor pins, the value of registers, and other information. In addition, debuggers also allow users to step<br><br>
through instructions and view how status information within the computer<br>
changes.<br>
[009]	Debugging embedded systems, such as faulted circuit indicators and<br>
faulted circuit indicator monitors, once they have been deployed can present<br>
special challenges. Generally, a separate computer running the debugger must<br>
be attached to the embedded device through a debugging port. Through the<br>
years a number of different debugging ports have been developed. Two of the<br>
most commonly used are RS232 and IEEE1149.1 (IEEE stands for the Institute<br>
of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, where 1149.1 refers to a particular<br>
standard that Is alternatively known as "JTAG"). RS232 is a standard serial<br>
communications port. A debugger using an RS232 port relies on special<br>
software running on the embedded system that will respond to debugging<br>
commands sent over the RS232 port. The debugging software running on the<br>
embedded system is often referred to as "monitor software." Because of this,<br>
debuggers relying on RS232 ports are vulnerable to defects in the embedded<br>
system software that may cause the monitor software to cease execution.<br>
[0010]	IEEE1149.1 addresses many of the problems with RS232 based<br>
debugging software. IEEE1149.1 relies on custom hardware built into the embedded microprocessor. This custom hardware includes a collection of pins that form a port, as well as custom hardware within the microprocessor that responds to commands sent over the port. The use of JTAG alleviates the risk<br><br>
of a crash in the embedded system software, which terminates the ability to continue debugging the embedded system.<br>
[0011 ]	Both RS232 and IEEE1149.1 require the use of a wired connection<br>
between a debugging computer and the embedded device. As many faulted circuit indicators and faulted circuit indicator monitors are deployed in underground locations where deep standing water is frequently present, field debugging using a wired connection is often inconvenient or even untenable.<br>
[0012]	Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide a simple wireless<br>
debugging tool for a faulted circuit indicator monitor allowing a user to view the contents of the faulted circuit indicator monitor's memory and to modify the contents of the faulted circuit indicator monitor's memory. Summary of the Invention<br>
[0013]	The present invention achieves its objective through the use of a<br>
wireless communications system for viewing memory locations within a power system device. The system includes a wireless device with an input mechanism, which the user may use to indicate memory locations that the user wishes to view. The wireless device also includes a radio frequency transmitter, which is used to transmit a message to the power system device containing the memory locations the user wishes to view. The power system device, on receiving the message through a radio frequency receiver, retrieves the selected memory locations using its microprocessor and generates a response message including the contents of the memory locations selected by the user.<br><br>
The message is then transmitted through a radio frequency transmitter within<br>
the power system device to the wireless device, where it is displayed on a<br>
display.<br>
[0014]	In another embodiment, the present invention encompasses a system for<br>
wirelessly modifying memory locations within a power system device. The system includes a wireless device with an input mechanism, which the user may use to indicate memory locations that the user wishes to modify as well as the values that the user wishes to input into those locations. The wireless device also includes a radio frequency transmitter, which is used to transmit a message to the power system device containing the selected memory locations as well as the desired contents of those memory locations. The power system device, on receiving the message through a radio frequency receiver, uses an embedded microprocessor to modify the selected memory locations with the new values selected by the user.<br>

Detailed Description of the Illustrated Embodiment<br>
[0015]	FIG. 1 illustrates a faulted circuit indicator monitoring system in<br>
accordance with the present invention. A number of overhead faulted circuit indicators 207 each contain a two-way radio that communicates the occurrence of a fault via a short range antenna 203 to a local site 110 having an intelligent module 106 installed near the faulted circuit indicators 207. The intelligent module then uses the existing wired telephone network (not shown) or a long range RF antenna 114b to communicate the fault occurrence to a remote site 112 via another long range RF antenna 114a. The remote site 112 Includes a remote module 107, which is connected to another site (not shown) via a wired connection 116. When a fault is detected by a faulted circuit indicator, the<br><br>
occurrence is communicated In the manner described above to the remote site<br>
112, triggering the dispatch of a team to the fauit site. The fault team then uses<br>
a wireless device 102 or equipment installed in a vehicle 104 to determine<br>
precisely which conductor 205 is faulted. Note that the conductors could also be<br>
underground 200 and only accessible through an access port (agr. a manhole)<br>
118. Faulted circuit indicators 206 attached to the underground conductors are<br>
wired to a radio interface unit 400 with a separate short range antenna 202 to<br>
communicate with the wireless device 102 (e.g., a wireless handheld device).<br>
In another embodiment, the wirefess device may be installed in a vehicle 104.<br>
[0016]	Referring to the drawings, and to FIG. 2 in particular, a wireless device<br>
communicates with a monitor connected to a number of power system devices. For illustration purposes only, the wireless device is in the form of a handheld device whereas the power system devices are in the form of underground faulted circuit indicators (not shown). The wireless device generally communicates through a radio frequency faulted circuit indicator monitor 400. The faulted circuit indicator monitor 400 includes a housing 402. A number of probe cavities 304 for connecting faulted circuit indicators (not shown) protrude from the housing 402. The radio frequency faulted circuit indicator monitor 400 also includes a microprocessor 310 with some amount of randomly accessible memory 312 (e.g., any type of randomly accessible memory, such as SRAM, DRAM, Internal registers, FLASH, etc.). Note that the memory need not be integrated within the microprocessor. The microprocessor Is coupled to an RF<br><br>
transceiver 322, which is coupled to an antenna 202 directiy or via a radio<br>
frequency cabie 208. The radio frequency faulted circuit indicator monitor 400<br>
communicates with a wireless device 102. A wide variety of wireiess<br>
communications protocols could be used, such as 802.11. The particular<br>
wireless communications protocol used is not significant to this invention, and<br>
as wireless communications protocols are well known in the art, no such<br>
protocol Is described.<br>
[0017]	Turning to FIG. 3, possible data formats for messages used to monitor<br>
and modify memory locations within the radio frequency faulted circuit indicator monitor are detailed. The "peek request" message 600 of FIG. 3A is sent by the wireless device to the radio frequency faulted circuit indicator monitor, and is used to retrieve the contents of a particular memory location or range of memory locations within the radio frequency faulted circuit indicator monitor. In the illustrated embodiment, the peek request message 600 contains a header 602 with data identifying the desired message (i.e.; peek request), and may include Information (e.g. an identification number of the faulted circuit indicator monitor) about the sending unit and/or the receiving unit. In addition, the illustrated peek request message 600 contains a field with the start address 604 of the data the user wishes to view as well as the number of bytes 606 starting at the start address 604 that the user wishes to view. To ensure reliability, the peek request message may also contain a cyclical redundancy check (CRC) 608, which is used to validate the contents of the message. Alternatively, the<br><br>
peek request message could use a different means for data validation, such as a checksum or parity bit.<br>
[0018]	FIG. 3B illustrates a "peek response" message 700, which contains the<br>
data requested by the peek request message. In the illustrated embodiment, the peek response message contains a header 702, with information identifying the message as a peek response, as well as information about the sending and/or receiving unit. In addition, the peek response message contains a data payload 704, with the contents of the memory locations requested. To ensure reliability, the peek response message may contain a CRC 706, which is used to validate the contents of the message. Alternatively, the peek response message could use a different means for data validation, such as a checksum or parity bit. The peek response message may also include the status of the faulted circuit indicator monitor, which may include, for example, a result from a self test such as a memory (RAM and/or flash memory) test, the expected useful life expectancy, battery usage, and the like.<br>
[0019]	FIG. 3C illustrates a "poke request" message 800, which is used to<br>
modify memory locations in the faulted circuit indicator or faulted circuit indicator monitor. In the illustrated embodiment, the poke request message 800 contains a header 802, with information identifying the message as a poke request, as well as Information about the sending and/or receiving unit in addition, the poke request message 800 contains a start address 804, which Identifies the address or range of addresses the user wishes to modify. The<br><br>
poke request message also contains a field with the number of bytes 806 to<br>
modify, as well as a data field 808 containing the bytes to be put into the<br>
address or range of addresses. Note that another scheme to identify the<br>
particular memory location or range of memory locations would work Just as<br>
weil. Finally, the poke request message may contain a CRC 810, which is used<br>
to validate the contents of the message. Alternatively, the poke request<br>
message could use a different means for data validation, such as a checksum<br>
or parity bit.<br>
[0020]	The poke request message could also be used to initiate a control or<br>
command in the faulted circuit indicator or faulted circuit indicator monitor. In this embodiment, the poke request message 800 may include a start address 804 which indicates to the faulted circuit indicator or faulted circuit indicator monitor that the data 808 includes a command or control. The data may indicate to the faulted circuit indicator or faulted circuit indicator monitor to undergo any of the available commands or controls on the faulted circuit indicator or faulted circuit indicator monitor, such as, for example, a Power on Reset (POR) which resets ail faulted circuit indicator latches to a closed state. Another example of a command or control is requiring the faulted circuit indicator or faulted circuit indicator monitor to undergo a complete FLASH and RAM self test. The command or control may require the faulted circuit indicator or faulted circuit indicator monitor to undergo a system test and write the results to a particular address, which may be later viewed using a peek request. Other<br><br>
commands or controls may require the faulted circuit indicator or faulted circuit indicator monitor to undergo an update of Data Flash, extend operating modes, decrease operating modes, or change a state of operation.<br>
[0021]	FIG. 3D illustrates a "poke response" message 900, which is used to<br>
acknowledge the poke request message 800. In the illustrated embodiment, the poke response message 900 contains a header 902, with information identifying the message as a poke response, as well as information about the sending and/or receiving unit. To ensure reliability, the poke response message may also contain a CRC 904, which is used to validate the contents of the message. Alternatively, the poke response message could use a different means for data validation, such as a checksum or parity bit.<br>
[0022]	FIG. 3E illustrates another "poke response" message 1000, which is<br>
used to acknowledge the poke request message 800 and indicate that the poke was successful. In the illustrated embodiment, the poke response message 1000 contains a header 1002, with information identifying the message as a poke response, as well as information about the sending and/or receiving unit. The illustrated poke response message 1000 also includes a status byte 1006, which communicates that the poke was successful, that is, that the requested memory change had taken place. To ensure reliability, the poke response message may also contain a CRC 1004, which is used to validate the contents of the message. Alternatively, the poke response message could use a different means for data validation, such as a checksum or parity bit.<br><br>
[0023]	As illustrated in Figure 4, during operation the user will first identify a<br>
particular power system device that the user wishes to troubleshoot. For example, the power system device may be in the form of a faulted circuit fndicator or faulted circuit indicator monitor (or other power system device) 400. As shown at 500, the user will then use the wireless device 102 to specify the device and select a particular memory location or locations within the power system device which the user wishes to view. As shown at 502, the wireless device 102 will then transmit a peek request message (e.g. a peek request for the memory location of step 500) to the power system device 400 that the user previously selected. As shown at 504, the targeted power system device 400 will retrieve the selected memory location or locations located therein. Thereafter, as shown at 506, the power system device 400 responds with a peek response message containing the contents of the memory locations the user wished to view. The wireless device 102 receives the message and displays the requested values as shown at 508. Depending on the contents of the memory location or locations that the user viewed, the user may wish to modify the contents of those locations.<br>
[0024]	To modify the contents of memory in the power system device 400, the<br>
user begins by choosing the address or addresses to modify using the wireless device 102 (as shown at 510), along with the values to place into the chosen memory locations (as shown at 512). The wireless device 102 then generates a poke request message (e.g. selected location and values), which is wirelessly<br><br>
transmitted to the targeted device as shown at 514. As discussed herein, the<br>
poke request message may include a command or control for the power system<br>
device 400 to execute. The power system device 400 recognizes in 520<br>
whether the poke request message includes a command or control. If the poke<br>
request message does include a command or control, the power system device<br>
400 executes the command or control in 522. The targeted device may further<br>
generate a poke response message in 524 including the success/failure or<br>
other status that is wirelessly transmitted to the wireless device 102. The poke<br>
response message may indicate the success of the poke. The wireless device<br>
102 then displays the success/failure or other status in 518. If, however, the<br>
poke request does not include a command or control, the microprocessor<br>
embedded within the targeted device then processes and executes the poke<br>
request message as shown at 516. Finally, the targeted device may further<br>
generate a poke response message in 524 including the success/failure or<br>
other status that is wirelessly transmitted to the wireless device 102. The poke<br>
response message may indicate the success of the poke. The wireless device<br>
102 then displays the success/failure or other status in 518.<br>
[0025]	In one embodiment, the poke may be followed by a peek to verify that<br>
the contents of the memory were modified as requested. To accomplish this peek sequence, the user selects a particular memory location or locations within the power system device that the user wishes to view using the wireless device 102. This will likely be the memory location(s) for which the modification<br><br>
was requested In the prior poke. Next, as shown at 502, the wireless device 102 wilf then transmit a peek request message (e.g. memory location of step 500) to the power system device 400 that the user previously selected. As shown at 504, the targeted power system device 400 will retrieve the memory location or locations located therein. Thereafter, as shown at 506, the power system device 400 responds with a peek response message containing the contents of the memory locations the user wished to view. The wireless device 102 receives the message and displays the contents of the message as shown at 508. The wireless device 102 may compare the contents of the memory locations requested with the requested modification and indicate to the user whether the requested modification did occur.<br>
[0026]	In yet another embodiment, either the peek or poke message could<br>
include any data related to the fauited circuit indicator or the power system associated therewith. For example, the message could contain information relating to the location of the faulted circuit indicator or the location of a condition in the power system. In one embodiment, the message could include data relating to the GPS location of the faulted circuit indicator or the GPS location of a fault on a a transmission line.<br>

purposes of illustration and description, and is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed. The description was selected to best explain the principles of the invention and practical application of these<br><br>
principles to enable others skilled in the art to best utilize the invention In various embodiments and various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated.
