FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to monomeric analogs of human<br>
insulin. More specifically, the present invention relates to<br>
a hexamer complex comprising an insulin analog, zinc, and a<br>
phenolic derivative.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Since the introduction of insulin in the 1920's, continuous<br>
strides have been made to improve the treatment of diabetes<br>
mellitus. Major advances have been made in insulin, purity,<br>
and availability. Various formulations with different time-<br>
actions have also been developed. Despite these<br>
improvements, subcutaneous injection therapy still falls<br>
short of providing the patient with convenient regulation<br>
and normalized glycemic control. Frequent excursions from<br>
normal glycemia levels over a patient's lifetime lead to<br>
hyper-or hypoglycemia, and long term complications including<br>
retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy, and micro- and<br>
macroangiopathy.<br>
To help avoid extreme glycemic levels, diabetics often<br>
practice multiple injection therapy whereby insulin is<br>
administered with each meal. However, this therapy has not<br>
yet been optimized. The most rapid-acting insulin<br>
commercially available peaks too late after injection and<br>
lasts too long to optimally control glucose levels.<br>
Recently, considerable effort has been devoted to create<br>
insulin formulations and insulin analog formulations that<br>
alter the kinetics of the subcutaneous absorption process.<br><br>
Because all commercial pharmaceutical formulations of<br>
insulin contain insulin in the self-associated state and<br>
predominately in the zinc-hexamer form, it is believed that<br>
the rate-limiting step for the absorption of insulin from<br>
the subcutaneous injection depot to the bloodstream is the<br>
dissociation of the self-aggregated insulin hexamer. Brange<br>
et al. in Diabetes Care 13: 923-954 (1990). To accelerate<br>
this absorption process, monomeric insulin analogs have been<br>
developed. These monomeric analogs possess a comparatively-<br>
more rapid onset of activity than insulin while retaining<br>
the biological activity of native human insulin. They<br>
provide a rapid absorption to bring the injection time and<br>
peak action of insulin into closer proximity with<br>
postprandial glucose excursion associated in the response to<br>
a meal. The preparation of various monomeric analogs is<br>
disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/388,201<br>
(Chance et al., EPO publication number 383 472), and Brange<br>
et al., EPO publication number 214 826.<br>
unfortunately, the modifications to insulin, which cause<br>
these analogs to be monomeric, also result in a high rate of<br>
polymer formation in parenteral formulations. Because the<br>
expiration of insulin preparations occurs when levels of 1%<br>
polymer are obtained (U.S. Pharmacopoeia, 1990), minimizing<br>
this type of degradation is extremely important in reducing<br>
undesirable side effects. Therefore, it was desirable to<br>
formulate monomeric analogs in such a manner to cause the<br>
analog to self-associate to form a stable conformation, yet<br>
maintain its rapid absorption.<br>
The addition of certain metal ions, primarily zinc, enhance<br>
the chemical stability by driving the insulin to associate<br>
and form hexamers, specifically the Zn(II)-T6 conformation.<br><br>
Further, phenolics have been shown to specifically bind to<br>
the insulin hexamer and induce an allosteric conformational<br>
change whereby the eight N-terminal amino acids of the B-<br>
chain are converted from the extended conformation to an<br>
alpha-helix. Derewenda, et al. Nature, 338: 594-596 (1989).<br>
This phenolic-bound conformation state is known as the<br>
Zn(II)-R state.<br>
In stark contrast to these well-established observations<br>
that insulin readily aggregates in the presence of zinc to<br>
form well defined, stable zn-hexamer structure, early<br>
studies with monomeric insulin analogs revealed that any<br>
aggregation between zinc and the insulin analog is distinct<br>
from that observed with insulin. B. H. Frank, Text and Slide<br>
copies of Lecture given at the Conference on Insulin "Self-<br>
Association and Conformational Studies on Human Proinsulin<br>
and Insulin Analogs", University of York, (Aug. 29-Sep. 1,<br>
1989). Further, the highly stable Zn-hexamer complex as seen<br>
with insulin is not observed with monomeric analogs. Id.<br>
Brems et al. Protein Engineering, 5:6, 527-533 (1992),<br>
disclose that monomeric LysB28 ProB29 -hi is less prone to<br>
dimerization and self-association to higher molecular weight<br>
forms than human insulin. Brems et al. continue to conclude<br>
that Asp828 ProB29 -hi, AlaB28 ProB29 -hi, and LysB28 ProB29 -hI<br>
show little or no Zn-induced association and that ProB29<br>
insulin, LysB28 insulin, AspB28 insulin, and AlaB28 insulin<br>
demonstrate Zn-induced association, but less than Zn-<br>
insulin. Subsequent, unpublished experimental observations<br>
by the present inventors suggest that association with zinc<br>
is observed; however, such association between the analog<br>
and zinc differs from insulin. The association that is<br>
observed with these analogs is to a multitude of higher<br>
molecular weight forms and distinct from the predominate,<br><br>
well-defined, Zn-insulin hexamers. Therefore, it is clear<br>
that monomeric insulin analogs do not form the Zn(II)-T6<br>
conformation in a manner analogous to insulin.<br>
In view of the published literature, it is surprising that<br>
the present invention affords monomeric insulin analogs in a<br>
well defined, stable zinc-phenol hexamer complex. This<br>
hexamer complex is uniquely different from those complexes<br>
observed with insulin under identical conditions. Insulin<br>
complexes with zinc and phenol are in a Zn(II)-R6<br>
conformation. The hexamer complex of the present invention<br>
is not identical to this conformation. Also quite<br>
remarkably, the insulin analog hexamer complex has a much<br>
greater propensity to dissociate than insulin. This<br>
propensity to dissociate translates into the desired fast-<br>
acting property.<br>
Brange et al. in Current Opinion in Structural Biology<br>
1:934-940 (1991) disclose various fast-acting stable insulin<br>
monomers and state that the obvious route to creating a<br>
fast-acting insulin is to prevent dimer or hexamer<br>
formation. Likewise, Brange et al. in Diabetes Care 13: 923-<br>
954 (1990) disclose that when insulin is administered as a<br>
hexamer, in addition to its slower free diffusion, the<br>
hexamer must be sterically more hindered than a monomer<br>
during the diffusion transport in the subcutis and/or during<br>
its passage through the capillary membrane. Further when<br>
injected subcutaneously, the Zn(II)-R6 conformation does not<br>
dissociate directly but must transform through the Zn(II)-T6<br>
conformation. These conformational changes and the<br>
dissociation therefrom delay the onset of activity.<br>
Therefore, one skilled in the art at the time of invention<br>
believed that efforts to chemically stabilize the monomeric<br><br>
insulin analog with zinc by forming a well defined, hexamer<br>
complex would be unsuccessful, or if successful, would<br>
sacrifice the rapid onset of action desired.<br>
The present formulation is a zinc-phenolic induced hexamer<br>
complex that is absorbed rapidly. The rate of absorption for<br>
the hexamer complex is at least two times that observed with<br>
insulin. Yet, when the hexamer complex is formulated, it is<br>
equally stable when compared to insulin against chemical<br>
degradation. Therefore, it is surprising that the present<br>
invention converts a monomeric insulin analog to a well-<br>
defined, stable zinc-phenol hexamer complex. Remarkably;<br>
when formulated, this hexamer complex retains the fast-<br>
acting properties associated with the monomeric insulin<br>
analog. Accordingly, the present invention provides a<br>
parenteral formulations of the insulin analog hexamer<br>
complex that is stable and fast-acting.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention provides a human insulin analog complex,<br>
which comprises: six molecules of a human insulin analog,<br>
two zinc ions, and at lease three molecules of a phenolic<br>
derivative selected from the group consisting of m-cresol,<br>
phenol, or a mixture of m-cresol and phenol; such that the<br>
analog complex is a hexamer. The invention further provides<br>
parenteral formulations comprising the hexamer complex.<br>

All amino acid abbreviations used in this disclosure are<br>
those accepted by the United States Patent &amp; Trademark<br>
Office as set forth in 37 C.F.R. § l/833(b)(2). A<br>
particularly preferred monomeric insulin analog is LysB28<br>
ProB29-human Insulin (B28 is Lys; B29 is Pro) .<br>
The term "treating", as used herein, describes the<br>
management and care of a patient for the purpose of<br><br>
combating the disease, condition, or disorder and includes<br>
the administration of a compound of present invention to<br>
prevent the onset of the symptoms or complications,<br>
alleviating the symptoms or complications, or eliminating<br>
the disease, condition, or disorder.<br>
The term "isotonicity agent" refers to an agent that is<br>
physiologically tolerated and embarks a suitable tonicity to<br>
the formulation to prevent the net flow of water across the<br>
cell membrane. Compounds, such as glycerine, are commonly<br>
used for such purposes at known concentrations.<br>
The term "phenolic derivative" or "phenolic" is m-cresol,<br>
phenol or a mixture of m-cresol and phenol. Preferably,<br>
phenolic is m-cresol.<br>
The term "physiologically tolerated buffer" is known in the<br>
art. A physiologically tolerated buffer is preferably a<br>
phosphate buffer, like sodium phosphate. Other<br>
physiologically tolerated buffers include TRIS, sodium<br>
acetate, or sodium citrate. The selection and concentration<br>
of buffer is known in the art.<br>
The insulin analogs of the present invention complex with<br>
zinc ions and a phenolic derivative to form a stable,<br>
hexamer conformation. Both the zinc and phenolic derivative<br>
are critical to achieve a complex that is stable and capable<br>
of rapid dissociation and onset of action. The hexamer<br>
complex consists of two zinc ions per hexamer of human<br>
insulin analog and at least three molecules of a phenolic<br>
derivative selected from the group consisting of m-cresol,<br>
phenol, or a mixture of m-cresol and phenol.<br><br>
 Soluble monomeric analog is converted to the hexamer complex<br>
by dissolving the monomeric analog in a diluent containing<br>
the phenolic derivative at a pH of about 7.5 and adding<br>
zinc. Zinc is preferably added as a salt. Representative<br>
examples of zinc salts include zinc acetate, zinc bromide,<br>
zinc chloride, zinc fluoride, zinc iodide and zinc sulfate.<br>
The skilled artisan will recognize that there are many other<br>
zinc salts which also might be used in the process of the<br>
present invention. Preferably, zinc acetate or zinc chloride<br>
is used because these salts do not add new chemical ions to<br>
commercially accepted processes.<br>
Dissolution of the analog may be aided by what is commonly<br>
known as an acid dissolution, i.e., the pH is lowered to<br>
about 3.0 to 3.5 with a physiologically tolerated acid,<br>
preferably HC1 to aid in the dissolution of the monomeric<br>
analog. Other physiologically tolerated acids include acetic<br>
acid, citric acid, and phosphoric acid. The pH is then<br>
adjusted with a physiologically tolerated base, preferably<br>
sodium hydroxide to about 7.4 to 7.5. Other physiologically<br>
tolerated bases include potassium hydroxide and ammonium<br>
hydroxide.<br>
The hexamer complex may be formulated into stable, rapid<br>
acting parenteral formulations. The concentration of insulin<br>
analog in the formulation is about 0.5 mg/ml to about 20<br>
mg/ml; preferably about 1.2 mg/ml to about 17.5 mg/ml; most<br>
preferably, about 3.5 mg/ml. In general, the concentration<br>
of zinc is about 10 µg/ml to about 50 µg/ml. The optimal<br>
concentration of zinc in the formulation is from about 14<br>
µg/ml to about 35 µg/ml, of which two zinc ions are bound to<br>
each hexamer. When formulated, the hexamer complex binds as<br>
many as seven phenolics. Generally, when formulated six<br><br>
phenolics are bound to the hexamer. Accordingly, excess<br>
phenolic is preferably added to the formulation. The<br>
phenolic also acts as a preservative. Therefore, the<br>
preferred concentration is about 23 mM to 35 mM, most<br>
preferably 29 mM. The phenolic is preferably m-cresol.<br>
An isotonicity agent, preferably glycerin, may be added to<br>
the formulation. The concentration of the isotonicity agent<br>
is in the range known in the art for insulin formulations,<br>
preferably about 16 mg/ml. The pH of the formulation may be<br>
buffered with a physiologically tolerated buffer, preferably<br>
a phosphate buffer, like sodium phosphate.<br>
At the time of invention, the published literature suggested<br>
that one skilled in the art needed to eliminate aggregation<br>
in order to get rapid absorption. Therefore, it is quite<br>
surprising that the formulated hexamer analog brings a rapid<br>
onset of action. Unlike insulin, the formation of an insulin<br>
analog hexamer complex does not adversely effect the time<br>
required to achieve peak serum insulin analog concentration.<br>
FIG. 1 demonstrates, in human patients, the mean glucose<br>
infusion rate response to a formulation containing monomeric<br>
LysB28 ProB29 -hi (formulated without zinc) ; a formulated<br>
LysB28 ProB29 -hi hexamer; and human Regular insulin. The<br>
formulated hexamer complex retains the rapid action of<br>
B29	B29<br>
monomeric Lys Pro -hI. The absorption rate is<br>
significantly more rapid than Regular human insulin. Thus,<br>
the results in FIG. 1 illustrate: First, hexamer LysB28 ProB29<br>
-hI and monomeric LysB28 ProB29 -hI have similar rates of<br><br>
absorption; second, both hexameric and monomeric LysB29 ProB29<br>
-hI have faster rates of absorption than insulin.<br><br>
The formulation comprising the insulin analog complex as<br>
hexamer is stable. In comparative studies, monomeric LysB28<br>
Pro -hI shows the greatest rate of degradation with a<br>
1.63% per week increase in polymer formation over the six<br>
week study. Unformulated human insulin undergoes a slower<br>
rate of polymer formation of 0.61% per week. Upon<br>
formulation, however, the rate of high molecular weight<br>
polymer formation is reduced to 0.095% per week for insulin.<br>
Formulated LysB28 ProB29 -hI, as a hexamer complex, exhibits a<br>
diminished rate of higher molecular weight polymer formation<br>
of 0.11% per week, which is comparable to the rate seen for<br>
formulated insulin. These studies are exemplified in Example<br>
1 and illustrated in FIG. 2.<br>
The insulin analog of the present invention can be prepared<br>
by any of avariety of recognized peptide synthesis<br>
techniques including classical (solution) methods, solid<br>
phase methods, semi synthetic methods, and more recent<br>
recombinant DNA methods. For example, Chance et al., U.S.<br>
patent application Ser. No. 07/388,201, EPO publication<br>
number 383 472, and Brange et al., EPO publication number<br>
214 826, disclose the preparation of various monomeric<br>
analogs.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The following examples and preparations are provided merely<br>
to further illustrate the preparation of the insulin analogs<br>
and the invention. The scope of the invention is not<br>
construed as merely consisting of the following examples.<br><br>
Preparation 1<br>
Protein stock Preparation:<br>
Unformulated samples of insulin and LysB28 ProB29 -hI were<br>
prepared at 3.5 mg/ml in 7 mM sodium phosphate, and with or<br>
without 1.25 mg/ml m-cresol, 1.09 mg/ml phenol and 16 mg/ml<br>
glycerol, depending on the experiment performed. Samples of<br>
LysB28 ProB29 -hI as a hexamer complex were prepared in an<br>
identical fashion except 19.7 mu.g/ml zinc was added. A11<br>
samples were taken through an acid excursion step to pH 3.0<br>
at which time zinc was added in the formulation lots. The pH<br>
was then adjusted to 7.4. Protein concentrations were<br>
determined prior to the addition of phenolics by UV<br>
absorption spectroscopy using an AVIV model 14 DS double-<br>
beam spectrophotometer. Protein concentrations were<br>
calculated as described in Frank, B. H., Pekar, A. H. and<br>
Veros, A. J. (1972) Diabetes, 21 (suppl. 2), 486-491.<br>
Example 1<br>
Chemical Stability:<br>
Degradation is initiated by incubating formulated and<br>
unformulated preparations of insulin and monomeric and<br>
hexameric LysB28 ProB29 -hI at 30 DEG C. The formulated<br>
insulin and hexamer LysB28 Pro529 -hI contained: 3.5 mg/ml<br>
protein, 16 mg/ml glycerol, 7 mM dibasic sodium phosphate<br>
heptahydrate, 1.25 mg/ml m-cresol, 1.09 mg/ml phenol, and<br>
0.0245 mg/ml zinc oxide at a pH of 7.3 to 7.4. The<br>
unformulated insulin and monomeric LysB28 ProB29 -hI<br>
contained: 3.5 mg/ml protein, 16 mg/ml glycerol, 7 mM<br>
dibasic sodium phosphate heptahydrate, 1.25 mg/ml m-cresol,<br>
and 1.09 mg/ml phenol at a pH of 7.3 to 7.4. At seven day<br><br>
intervals, samples were removed from the 30°C incubation and<br>
assayed for formation of high molecular weight species using<br>
size-exclusion HPLC. Analysis is performed by injecting 20<br>
µl samples into a Dupont Zorbax GF-250 Special (9.4 x 250<br>
mm) column using a mixture of 0.4M ammonium bicarbonate and<br>
acetonitrile as the eluting solution (flow rate of 0.5<br>
ml/min at ambient temperature and detection at 214 ran). The<br>
percent polymer formation is determined from the ratio of<br>
the high molecular weight peak to the total area of the<br>
monomer and high molecular weight peaks. The results are<br>
illustrated in FIG. 2.<br>
Example 2<br>
Static Light Scattering:<br>
The in vitro dissociation properties of monomeric LysB28<br>
Pro829 -hI, LysB28 Pro829 -hI as a hexamer complex, and insulin<br>
are probed using static light scattering.<br>
Three formulated and unformulated protein stock solutions<br>
are prepared as described except that the unformulated<br>
protein stock solutions did not contain zinc, glycerol, or<br>
preservatives. Using these 3.5 mg/ml stocks, a series of<br>
dilutions is prepared for both insulin and LysB28 Pro829 -hI<br>
spanning the protein concentration range of 3.5 mg/ml to 0.2<br>
mg/ml. All dilutions are made to a final volume of 10 ml<br>
with 7 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, in order to mimic<br>
the subcutaneous site upon injection. All solutions were<br>
filtered through 0.2 µm Gelman low protein binding filters<br>
before performing SLS measurements. The protein<br>
concentration for these samples is determined using reversed<br>
phase HPLC.<br><br>
For analysis of the formulated samples, protein-free solvent<br>
blanks were prepared for each set of protein samples. These<br>
blanks contained excipients at the same concentration as the<br>
corresponding protein sample sets. For analysis of the<br>
unformulated samples, a single blank of 7 mM sodium<br>
phosphate is used. Using these appropriate solvent blanks<br>
insured that data reflected only solute scatter and not an<br>
added contribution due to solvent changes.<br>
Static light scattering (SLS) experiments are performed<br>
using a Brookhaven Instruments 2030AT autocorrelator and<br>
goniometer. All measurements are made with a 1 mm pinhole at<br>
90° scattering angle using a Lexel Model 3500 argon ion<br>
laser set at 488 nm. The temperature is maintained at 25°C<br>
by a Neslab RTE-110 temperature bath. The signal at the<br>
photomultiplier tube is calibrated using 0.1 urn filtered<br>
toluene.<br>
Weight-average molecular weights are calculated using the<br>
equations described in Cantor, C. R., and Schimmel, P. R.,<br>
Biophysical Chemistry, W. H. Freeman and Company, New York,<br>
pp. 838-843 (1982). FIG. 3 discloses the results of the<br>
light scattering study. The in vitro dissociation profile of<br>
LysB28 Pro829 -hI as a hexamer complex and insulin are quite<br>
different. The insulin analog results demonstrate a rapid<br>
dissociation, which allows for a faster absorption than<br>
human insulin. Even though both preparations contain<br>
hexameric association states and the formulations are<br>
equally stable against chemical degradation, hexamer Lys<br>
Pro829 -hI has a greater propensity to dissociate than<br>
insulin.<br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1.	A human insulin analog complex, which comprises: six<br>
molecules of a human insulin analog, two zinc ions,<br>
and at least three molecules of a phenolic derivative<br>
selected from the group consisting of m-cresol,<br>
phenol, or a mixture of m-cresol and phenol, wherein<br>
the human insulin analog is LysB28ProB29-human insulin.<br>
2.	A parenteral pharmaceutical formulation comprising the<br>
human insulin analog complex of Claim 1.<br>
3.	The parenteral pharmaceutical formulation of Claim 2,<br>
which comprises about 3.5 mg/ml LysB28ProB29-human<br>
insulin, about 19.7 ug/ml zinc, about 7 mM sodium<br>
phosphate, about 16 mg/ml glycerin, and about 29 mM tri-<br>
cresol.<br><br><br><br>
Abstract<br><br><br>
The present invention discloses a human insulin<br>
analog hexamer complex and formulations. More specifically,<br>
the present invention relates to various parenteral<br>
formulations, which comprise: human insulin analogs in a<br>
hexamer conformation, zinc ions, and at least three molecules<br>
of a phenolic derivative selected from the group consisting<br>
of m-cresol, phenol, or a mixture of m-cresol and phenol.<br>
The formulation provides a rapid onset of action.</td>
