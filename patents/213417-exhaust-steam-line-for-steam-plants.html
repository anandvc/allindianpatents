FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention concerns an exhaust steam line for steam plants.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The purpose of an exhaust steam line of a steam plant, particularly of a steam turbine, is to convey the exhaust steam from the outlet of the steam turbine, i.e. from its turbine exhaust steam socket, via a main exhaust steam line to branch lines, through which the exhaust steam is conveyed to individual condensation elements. This is carried out as extensively as possible by operating with vacuum. The line of an exhaust steam for an air-cooled condensator uses usually diameters between 1 m and 10 m.<br>
Inside the exhaust line local flow losses occur, that are caused by a local change of the cross-section for the flow or of the direction of the flow. Despite the step-by-step reduction of the cross-section of the line in the case of known exhaust steam lines at the joint of the branch line a loss of pressure can be expected at the joint opening of the branch line of the exhaust line of the steam passing freely by this joint opening. From the German patent specification 1 945 314 an exhaust steam line is known, wherein an as small as possible loss of pressure should be achieved at the branching-offs of the branch lines by that the reduction of the cross-section of the line is achieved in each case by two pipes with different diameters that are pushed into one another, while the smaller pipe is inserted into the larger one by forming an annular space so far, that the joint<br><br>
-2-<br>
opening of the branch line in the larger pipe is covered in the radial direction. It is a disadvantage of this embodiment, that the loss of pressure cannot be reduced past a minimal value. In the case f this deflection of the flow of the exhaust steam losses will occur in principle in the region of the joints. In addition to these flow losses pressure losses will occur due to the length of the line.<br>
When the main exhaust steam line runs horizontally in the vicinity of the floor, long upwards running branch lines have to be appropriately provided. Therefore the horizontally running main exhaust steam line is installed higher, so that the individual branch lines could be made shorter. This, however, makes it necessary to provide at least two 90° deflections within the main exhaust steam line, while for the purpose of reduction of the resistance coefficient scoop elbows have to be installed inside the curves. These may have a very great tare weight of 7 to 201 on the one hand and result in greater installation expenses on the other.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
Based on the above the object of the invention is to produce an exhaust steam line for steam plants with reduced installation and material costs, while at the same time the loss of pressure is as small as possible.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the invention is achieved by an exhaust steam line having the features of the invention. The core of the invention is the arrangement of the main exhaust steam line steam at an angle to the horizontal, in fact so that the<br><br>
-3-<br>
main exhaust steam line rises in the direction of flow of the exhaust steam, while the branching-off angle measured between a linear section of the main exhaust steam line and the branch lines is smaller than 90° and the length of the individual branch lines, viewed in the direction of flow of the exhaust steam, decreases.<br>
The basic idea of the new direction of the line is base on the principle of an as direct joining as possible between the joint of the main exhaust steam line at a low height to a plurality of joints of the branch lines on the distributor pipe at a greater height. The rising arrangement of the main exhaust steam line has the advantage, that although the individual branch lines have different lengths, in totality they can be constructed shorter than it would be the case in an entirely horizontally running main exhaust steam line. By virtue of this the length of the flow path is reduced altogether.<br>
Ttie use of less material leads to weight reduction in the exhaust steam line and not least also to savings of expenses as well as also with regard to assembly. The reason for the cost saving in the assembly is, inter alia, that the branch lines made up from individual ring segments are shorter and consequently fewer welding operations are required to join the ring segments with one another. In addition, the total assembled weight is less, enabling a simpler manipulation. Finally, the load on the foundation is lower, so that smaller foundations can be used.<br>
When compared with arrangements with right-angled configurations between the main exhaust steam line and the branch lines, a basic advantage is that the flow<br><br>
-4-<br>
losses, resulting in pressure losses, are reduced. The pressure loss is proportional to the resistance coefficient of the pipeline system. The magnitude of the resistance coefficient is determined by the number and construction of the curves and pipe branching-offs. In the region of the joints of the branch fines the resistance coefficient is reduced by setting the main exhaust steam line obliquely in accordance with the invention. In principle the smaller the branching-off angle the lower the resistance coefficient. The branchlng-off angle is measured between the plane of the cross-section of the main exhaust steam line and the plane of the cnoss-section of a branch line. In the case of parallel cross-section planes this angle is 0°. In the case of the arrangement according to the invention the usual branching-off angle is reduced from 90° by the angle of inclination of the main exhaust steam line, so that at each joint of a branch line the resistance coefficients will be lower than in the case of a 90° deflection. This results in an considerably lower overall level of loss and a smaller pressure loss within the exhaust steam line than is the case in the known arrangements with right-angled configurations.<br>
A further advantage is that the main exhaust steam line rises relatively smoothly from the lower height level of the steam turbine. The branching-off angle, measured relative to the horizontal, is in a range of 5° to 60°. The angle is preferably in a range of 10° to 20°. Greater angles have the disadvantage, that the resistance coefficient in the transition area from the horizontal linear section of the main exhaust steam line to the oblique linear section of the main exhaust steam line would be greater, so that greater pressure losses would occur already early. In the case of very small branching-off angles, in particular at branching-<br><br>
-5-<br>
off angles below 100, the pressure losses are considerably lower than in the case for 90° bends commonly used. In addition., there is no need for additional deflecting devices, e.g. scoop elbows, due to which the exhaust steam line according to the invention can have a simpler construction. Furthermore, the return of the condensate against the direction of the steam flow in the main exhaust steam line will be better.<br>
The choice of the branching-off angle depends on the length of the main exhaust steam line and the relevant plant conditions. Important is that for the changing of the height level of the main exhaust steam line no 90° bends should be present inside the line, only branching-offs that are considerably smaller than 90°.<br>
Within the scope of the invention it is possible that via an oblique gradient a first main exhaust steam line and a second main exhaust steam line are connected to a common central line. This corresponds essentially to a V-shaped arrangement of the main exhaust steam lines with a central steam supply, for which the above mentioned advantages are also valid.<br>
At least one of the branch lines is arranged in the direction of flow of the exhaust steam at an oblique rising branching-off angle to the main exhaust steam line. Therefore the top ends of the branch lines and their joints are not in the same vertical plane. In this arrangement the flow losses at the individual joints are reduced once again.<br><br>
-5a-<br>
lt is considered as particularly advantageous when the branch line at the external ends of the main exhaust steam line has the same orientation as the main exhaust steam line. In the sense of the invention under "same orientation" the parallelness or congruence of the longitudinal axes of the main exhaust steam line and of the branch line Is understood. In the case of this configuration the angle of the main exhaust steam line relative to the horizontal is decisively determined by the horizontal and vertical distance of the last condensation element from the turbine. Since the main exhaust steam line blends into the final branch line without any curvature, the main exhaust steam line is correspondingly shorter. In the case of this arrangement the total weight is further reduced despite the somewhat longer last branch line.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the exhaust steam line according to the invention at least one branch line is divided at least into two partial lines. By virtue of this the exhaust steam flow, flowing through the branch line, is divided into two , each of them flowing to a condensation element. Under certain geometric conditions it is more expedient to divide the branch line into two partial lines, instead of providing a further branch line, that would have had to be directly connected to the main exhaust steam line. By virtue of the additional<br>
branching off of the branch line into two or more partial lines it is possible to further reduce the material usage and to reduce the total assembled weight. The partial lines are advantageously arranged obliquely rising at a branching-off angle relative to the branch line. In this manner the flow losses can be kept as low as possible. The branching-off angles are markedly smaller than 90°.<br><br>
-5b-<br>
In the region of at least one joint of a branch line or of a partial line a sheet metal deflector is provided to divide the exhaust steam flow into partial exhaust steam flows. The purpose of the sheet metal deflector is to divide the exhaust steam flow with as small as possible flow losses. The flow losses are preferably identical in each partial exhaust steam flow. The ratio of the partial exhaust steam flows corresponds to the ratio of distributor pipes following a joint. If, for example, there are altogether five branching-offs from a main exhaust steam line, while the same amount of exhaust steam should be supplied to the individual distributor pipes, then, viewed in the direction of the flow, at the first joint 1/5 of the exhaust steam flow has to be branched off. At the next joint 1/4 of the reduced exhaust steam flow is to be branched off. Correspondingly, 1/3 and 1/2 at the following joints. If a branch line is divided into two partial lines, each leading to a distributor pipe!, double quantity of exhaust steam is to be supplied to the corresponding branch line.<br>
The oblique direction of the main exhaust steam line makes a freer supply of the cooling air below the condensator elements possible, that depending on the arrangement may lead to a lower height of the platform and consequently to the reduction of the cost of the steel structure. In addition the accessibility of the plant is improved, since one can pass through under the main exhaust steam line.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The invention is explained in the following in detail based on the embodiments schematically illustrated in the accompanying drawings. They show in:<br>
Figs. 1 and 2- the state-of-the-art regarding the direction of exhaust steam lines for air -cooled condensators,<br><br>

Figs.6.1 and 6.2 - two embodiments of the exhaust steam line according to the invention with a V-shaped configuration for the central exhaust steam supply, and<br>
Fig.7 - a further embodiment of the exhaust steam line according to the invention.<br>
and<br>
Fig.8 - a variation of the embodiment according to Fig.7.<br>
Fig.1 shows the state-of-the-art an exhaust steam line 1 with a horizontal main exhaust steam line 2 with branch lines 3 extending from it vertically upwards. Distributor pipes 30 of condensation elements, not illustrated In detail, are joined to the top ends of the branch lines 3. This configuration of an exhaust steam line 1 has the disadvantage that the individual branch lines 3 are very long and have to be appropriately supported along their lengths. Since for the purpose of compensation of thermal longitudinal changes compensators are provided in the branch lines 3, the individual sections of the branch lines 3 have to be positionally orientated on the steel structure, not illustrated in detail. The cost of this is not insignificant. The total length of the line is relatively great, so that considerable tonnages have to be transported. The expense of assembling is consequently also high.<br>
In the embodiment according to Fig.2, that is also according to the state-of-the-art, a horizontal linear section of the main exhaust steam line 2 is provided in a raised position, so that the individual branch lines 3 can be executed shorter. The advantage of this is that the correspondingly lighter branch lines 3 can be less expensively orientated regarding their positions despite the inclusion of compensators. On the other hand at least two 90° bends of the main exhaust<br><br>
7<br>
steam line are required so that to divert the exhaust steam flow exiting in the horizontal direction to the vertical linear section and then again from the vertical linear section to the horizontal linear section. Without additional scoop elbows in the curves these diversions, each at 900, would lead to high flow losses. In the case of larger plants the weight of such a scoop elbow is approx. 7-20t, which have to be supported in the lifted position. This great weight may be an additional problem in the case of an earthquake. Because the horizontal linear section of the main exhaust steam line, including the scoop elbow, is of considerable weight, in the transition to the vertical linear section of the main exhaust steam line in earthquake-prone areas special support constructions have to be employed to absorb the vertically acting earthquake tremors.<br>
In the state-of-the-art spring supports 4 are used to compensate for the thermal longitudinal changes, so that to ensure an adequate support of the horizontally extending linear section of the main exhaust steam line. There is, however, the risk that in the case of vertical earthquake tremors the relatively great weight of the main exhaust stem line and of the scoop elbow cannot be absorbed by the springs of the spring supports, consequently additional shock-brakes have to be provided in the form of hydraulic absorbers. These shock-brakes, In combination with the springs of the spring supports 4, form a spring-absorber arrangement. that prevents the forces Introduced during an earthquake to continue from the main exhaust steam line 2 to the steam turbine, to which the main exhaust steam line 2 is finally connected. The spring supports 4, in combination with the shock-brakes, are relatively expensive components, as depending from the length of the main exhaust steam line 2 a number of them have to be provided to ensure an even raising and lowering of the horizontal linear section of the main exhaust steam line 2. In Fig.2 the further spring supports 4 are schematically indicated by twice broken lines.<br>
Fig.3.1 shows the exhaust steam line 5 according to the invention, that differs from the embodiments of Figs.1 and 2. i.e. from the state-of-the-art, by that the main exhaust steam line 10 is arranged in the direction of flow of the exhaust steam rising at an angle W to the horizontal H. In this example the branching-off angle W is 10°. Altogether five branch lines 6, rising vertically upwards, are<br><br>
8<br>
connected to the main exhaust steam line 10. while the cross-section of the line is reduced after each joint 7 of a branch line 6. In this configuration the branch line 6, on the right in the plane of the figure, is considerably shorter than the first rising branch line 6 in the left half of the figure. Due to the oblique arrangement the branching-off angle Wl between the rising linear section 9 of the main exhaust steam line 10 and the respective branch lines 6 is smaller than 900. In this embodiment it is 80". The resistance coefficient of the pipe branches are therefore smaller than in the case of a 900 branching-off.<br>
A further advantage is that the branching-off angle W2 between the horizontal linear section 8 and the rising linear section 9 of the main exhaust steam line 10 results in very slight resistance coefficients within this bend, so that there is no need for a scoop elbow. In the case of a reduced overall length of the lines the exhaust steam can be fed to the condensation elements (not shown in detail) at the upper ends of the branch lines 6 without the use of scoop elbow/s with simultaneously reduced pressure losses.<br>
The rising linear section 9 of the main steam exhaust line 10 Is mounted on hinged supports 11. The hinged supports 11 compensate for the thermal longitudinal changes acting in the longitudinal direction of the rising linear section 9. In the case of vertically acting earthquake loads the rising linear section 9 does not execute any undue force on the steam turbine, so that the construction expenses for the exhaust steam line 5 according to the invention is lower overall. By virtue of the rise of the main exhaust steam line 10a freer entry of the air below the platfomi of the air-cooled condensation elements is possible. In addition, the accessibility of the entire plant is improved. In the embodiment of Fig.1 very often long paths had to be covered, since the direct path was blocked by the main exhaust steam line 2, provided near to the floor. In the case of the arrangement according to the invention it is possible to pass under the main exhaust steam line 10. A further advantage is the reduced area of the exhaust steam line 5 to wind loads. It is clear, that in the case of the direction of the line according to Figs.3.1 and 3.2 the total area ofengagement is smaller than in the case of the embodiments according to Figs.1 or 2.<br><br>
9<br>
The embodiment of Fig.3.2 differs from that of Fig.3.1 by that the individual branch lines 6', 6", 6'" are not at right angles to the horizontal, but extend also obliquely rising. In this embodiment the slope of the rising liner section 9 of the main exhaust steam line and of the angle W is so chosen, that the branch line 6"' provided at the external end of the riising liner section 9 has the same orientation as the rising linear section 9 of the main exhaust steam line. In the case of the embodiment of Fig.3.2 the angle W is in fact greater relative to the horizontal H than in the case of the embodiment of Fig.3.1, so that slightly higher flow losses will occur in the transition region from the horizontal linear section 8 to the rising linear section 9, although the branching-off angle, designated by W3', W3", between the rising linear section 9 and the branch lines 6', 6" are smaller than in the case of the embodiment of Fig.3.1, so that these flow losses at the joints 7 of the individual branch lines 6', 6" are smaller both individually and in total. For this reason the cross-section of the line of the rising linear section 9 can be dimensioned smaller from the first joint 7 onward, resulting in considerable savings in material and weight, so that lower assembly weights and lower assembly expenses are possible. Consequently lower tare, wind, earthquake and foundation loads will result.<br>
Each piece of the rising linear section 9 situated between two joints 7 is carried by a support 11'. In principle the branching-off angles W3',W3" may be different. The branching-off angles W3', W3" can become in particular smaller towards the external end of the rising linear section 9 and become even zero, as is shown in Fig.3.2.<br>
According to the state-of-the-art exhaust steam lines 12, 13 are known, as they are illustrated in Figs.4 and 5. These embodiments essentially correspond to the arrangements according to Figs.1 and 2 mirror-imaged about a vertical axis, with the difference that in this case a total of 4 to 12 branch lines are provided, that are connected to a central line 15 via transversely extending branches of the main exhaust steam lines 14. Fig.5 also illustrates the spring supports 4, already explained for this embodiment in Fig.2. The disadvantages were explained based on Figs.1 and 2 and are applicable also for this embodiment.<br><br>
10<br>
The embodiment according to the invention of Fig.6.1 also shows a central line 16, from which a main exhaust steam line 17 and a main exhaust steam line 18 extends to the right and the left, respectively, with opposite directed rises. The individual main exhaust lines 17, 18 are again mounted on supports 11, In particular on hinged supports. With regards to the advantages of this embodiment reference Is made to the description of Fig.3.1, that also applies for this variation of the exhaust steam line 19 according to the invention.<br>
In principle the hinged supports 11 can be substituted by stationary supports with a teflon/high-grade steel sliding footing.<br>
The embodiment of Fig.6.2 differs from that of Fig.6.1, Inter alia, by that the angle W between the horizontal H and the main exhaust steam lines 17, 18 Is increased. The angle W is so chosen, that in each case the last branch line 6'" or the one at the end extends aligned with the main exhaust steam line 17, 18. For this reason the external branch line 6'" has become to a certain extent a component of the main exhaust steam line 17,18. A further difference is that the branch lines 6" in the middle of the individual main exhaust steam lines 17, 18 are not at right angles to the horizontal H, as is the case for Flg.6.1, but are also sloping. The branching-off angle between the main exhaust steam line 17, 18 and these branch lines 6" is designated by W3". When compared with the embodiments of Figs.4 and 5, one can recognise that the branching-off angle W3" is markedly smaller than 90° and is even smaller than that of the embodiment in Fig.6.1. The shorter,, and consequently lighter, exhaust steam lines 6, 6", 6'" contribute also in the case of this execution to the reduction of the tare, wind, earthquake and foundation loads.<br>
Fig.7 shows an embodiment of an ejxhaust steam line 20, wherein the angle W between the horizontal H and the main exhaust steam line 21 is greater in comparison with the previous embodiments. The main exhaust steam line 21 is connected directly to a central line 22 without a horizontally extending Intermediate piece. The angle W is again so chosen, that the last or final branch line 6*" extends aligned with the main exhaust steam line 21. Because in this embodiment the main exhaust steam line 21 rises relatively steeply, the<br><br>
11<br>
branching-off angle W2 between the branch lines 6, 6a vertically rising from the main exhaust steam line 21 and the main exhaust steam line 21 is very small, so that the flow losses in the joints 7 of the main exhaust steam line 21 are low. The peculiarity of this embodiment is that the branch line 6a is divided into two partial lines 23, 24, while each partial line 23, 24 leads to a condensation element, not illustrated in detail. The branch line 6a, originating from the main exhaust steam line 21, extends first vertically upwards up to a joint 7a. The partial line 24 branches off from this joint 7a at a branching-off angle W4, whereas the other partial line 23 is continued vertically upwards as a straight extension of the branch line 6a. By virtue of the additional partial line 24 the need for a further branch line, that would have had to be extended to the main exhaust steam line 21, is eliminated. Therefore, particularly in the case of steeply rising exhaust steam lines 21. it is advisable to provide additional branches or partial lines on the individual branch lines.<br>
Fig.8 shows an enlarged detail of the embodiment of Fig.7. In contrast to the previous embodiment, sheet metal deflectors 25, 26, 27 are integrated in the joints 7, 7a. The sheet metal deflectors 25, 26, 27 serve the purpose of dividing the exhaust steam flow into partial exhaust steam flows in accordance with the ratios of the distributor pipes following the joint 7, 7a. In the embodiments of Figs.7 and 8 altogether four distributor pipes of the condensation elements are supplied with exhaust steam. Accordingly at each joint a division of the exhaust steam flow is carried out in a ratio of 1:1. The even division is achieved by that the sheet metal deflectors 25, 26, 27 are mounted inside the main exhaust steam line 21 and the branch line 6a, respectively already before the respective joints 7, 7a. A circular cross-section of the main exhaust steam line 21 and of the branch line 6a is divided by this into two half-circle each. If the cross-section of the main exhaust steam line 21 and of the branch line 6a is not a circular cross-section, an even division of the area is carried out. Each sheet meta! deflector 25, 26, 27 is so constructed, that an even division of the area is accomplished both before the joints 7, 7a and in the region of the joints 7, 7a. What is essential in this case is that the pressure losses of the par1.ial exhaust steam flows in the region of the joints 7, 7a are almost the same and the volume of the exhaust steam is divided into equal volumes.<br><br>
12<br>
In the embodiment shown the sheet metal deflectors 25, 26, 27 are angled. The front linear region 28 of the respective individual sheet metal deflectors 25, 26, 27 has a length L corresponding to the diameters D1, D2, D3 of the main exhaust steam line 21 and the exhaust steam line 6a of the respective joint 7, 7a.
