				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method for improving coke strength. More<br>
particularly it relates to a method for improving metallurgical coke strength by<br>
water quenching after carbonization in coke oven battery adaptable to blast<br>
furnace use.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
It has been established that upon quenching the coke undergoes the same<br>
physico-mechanical changes as any solid. Depending on the rate of cooling, the<br>
stress in coke pieces of various sizes and shapes act in different ways. When<br>
these stresses exceed their threshold limits, it leads to weakening of coke due to<br>
formation of cracks and micro fissures. The hot red coke is pushed out from the<br>
oven; its appearance is characterized by a network of fissures extending<br>
throughout the coke mass, with a large central crack running through the height<br>
of the oven. During the subsequent quenching, handling and screening<br>
operations, breakage tends to occur along these fissures. It is a fact that coke is<br>
heterogeneous with respect to its physical properties, in that it contains fissures,<br>
cracks and other weaknesses and hence, the strength of the coke is determined<br>
by the degree of fissuring and other weaknesses in the coke. These flaws in the<br>
structure of coke, which determine its behaviour in use, stem from the<br>
composition, preparation of the charge to the oven and on the condition of<br>
carbonization.<br><br>
The prior art investigations carried out by different authors have shown that the<br>
electric resistivity, the heat of wetting, reactivity, volume changes and other<br>
physico-mechanical and physico-chemical properties reflect changes in the<br>
structure of coke at different energy levels.<br>
In high temperature range, where the structure is denser and more strongly<br>
stressed, at the coke pushing temperature (1000 to 850°C) the quenching rate<br>
must be minimal as possible. When the final temperature from 850-650°C is<br>
maintained the coke structure is still quite stressed and the temperature gradient<br>
between the surface of the coke and center being rather high, the quenching<br>
rate can be increased slightly. When the final temperature range from 650-200°C<br>
is maintained the rate of quenching may be increased to such an extent as to<br>
prevent the generation of stress exceeding the ultimate strength of the coke.<br>
It has not yet been established conclusively to what extent residual fissures<br>
influence the mechanical strength of cokes. In part, the difficulty in assessing<br>
their role lies in the lack of comprehensive methods of characterization, which<br>
enable fissuring to be quantified and compared.<br>
It is quite evident from the analysis of coke made through various quenching<br>
methods described above that the strength characteristics of coke depends not<br>
only on the selection of coal and preparation of coal blends for coking, but also<br>
on the method of quenching of coke after it is pushed from coke oven chamber.<br>
The present invention is aimed to solve the difficulties of prior arts as narrated<br>
above to solve the long standing and extent problem in coke quenching to fond<br>
out appropriate cooling method.<br><br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore, an object of the present invention to propose a method of<br>
improving coke strength by water quenching which eliminates the disadvantage<br>
of existing state of Arts.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose a method of improving<br>
coke strength by water quenching which decreases residual fissures in coke.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to propose a method of improving<br>
coke strength by water quenching which is eco-friendly.<br>

DETAILS DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE<br>
INVENTION<br>
The present invention comprises of a quenching tower to cool hot coke. A<br>
quenching tower is a reinforced concrete frame with brick line structure. The<br>
water used for quenching is recycled after settling in the breeze pond and<br>
pumped up to the overhead tanks of the quenching tower. Near coke oven<br>
battery a semi flood quench system is employed, which means the water sprayed<br>
on the quenching car is not allowed to drain away and creates a pool of water in<br>
the quenching car. The coke floats in the car, levels itself and gets quenched<br>
more uniformly and instantly. A quenching method was developed to study the<br>
effect of coke quenching under different condition in coke oven battery under<br>
existing condition of quenching system (See Table 1)<br>
The coke samples after quenching were collected from wharf for each trial. Each<br>
sample was subjected to screen analysis on 100mm, 80mm, 50mm, 40mm,<br>
30mm, 20mm and 10mm size screens. The plus 50mm size coke (50Kg lot) was<br>
stabilized and M40, M10, CSR &amp; CRI were determined.<br>
The fissure analysis was done in Quantimet 550 Image analyzer using Leica<br>
software. The coke was sliced to 25mm X25 X 15mm and subjected to image<br>
analyzer and total area was measured. Area of each micro fissures present in<br>
total area was measured in manual mode then area percentages of micro<br>
fissures were calculated. In this analysis differentiation was made between pores<br>
and fissures. In pores, length was considered equal to width whereas, in fissures,<br>
it was assumed that length was not equal to width and the basic parameters<br>
recorded were area, perimeter, breadth and length.<br>
Figures 1 to 9 shown the parameters in the ordinates in coke quality parameter<br>
with respect of top quenching condition, side quenching and gap between two<br><br>
quenching cooling method, herein denoted in the abscissae as quenching<br>
conditions. The parameters used are coke strength after reaction (CSR), coke<br>
reactivity index (CRI), Micum Indices (M40 and M10), micro-fissures and coke<br>
moisture. The starting material utilized in the process may be derived from any<br>
coal source which is suitable for metallurgical coke making and coke quality<br>
parameter can be determined by standard practice.<br>
For evaluation of quality of coke on cooling the said parameters are compared<br>
with the 10,15 and 20 seconds of quenching with water the carbonized coke<br>
from 1000°C. Good quality coke is assessed for room temperature strength<br>
which is important at the time of charging and in stock zone of blast furnace. It<br>
was observed that from the graph in Figure 1, 4 and 7 that slow cooling<br>
improves M40 and M10 decreases due to which performance of coke in stack zone<br>
of blast furnaces improves. Fig 3, 6 and 9 showed that micro-fissures and coke<br>
moisture is lower with compared to higher cooling rate.<br>
Considering all the aspects from above test results it is recommended that<br>
methods of 15 seconds top quenching, 15 seconds of side quenching and<br>
keeping 20 seconds gap between side quenching and second top quenching of<br>
40 seconds most suitable fro carbonized coke cooling. But the present invention<br>
qualify an improved process guides to produce metallurgical grade of coke<br>
applicable to all the above three quenching conditions on precise process control<br>
to be maintained with slow cooling rate when quenched in water from higher<br>
temperature. The proposed invention has developed methods of cooling of<br>
carbonized coke at high temperature (1000°C) of different combinations of<br>
quenching conditions through characterize evaluation from test results to<br>
maintain compatible coke strength after carbonization to produce metallurgical<br>
grade coke.<br>
The invention as narrated hereinabove and illustrated with an exemplary<br>
embodiment of the invention should not be read and construed in a restrictive<br><br>
manner as various modifications of the apparatus, adaptations and alterations of<br>
the constructive parts of the apparatus and method steps, coke sizes and<br>
process control steps are possible within the scope and limit of the invention as<br>
defined in the encompassed appended claims.<br>
