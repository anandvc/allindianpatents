				<td>Process for Catalytically Generating Organic<br>
Substances by Partial Oxidation<br>
This invention relates to a process for catalytically gener-<br>
ating organic substances by partial oxidation of an organic<br>
feedstock in the presence of molecular oxygen at temperatures<br>
in the range from 200 to 500°C in one or more series-<br>
connected reactors containing a catalyst for generating a<br>
gaseous product mixture.<br>
The conversion of the feedstock into the end product is ef-<br>
fected in one or more oxidation steps, where in each oxida--<br>
tion step the individual molecules of the feedstock can re-<br>
lease one ore more atoms of hydrogen and/or carbon and also<br>
bind individual oxygen atoms. The carbon released combines<br>
with oxygen to form carbon dioxide and/or carbon monoxide,<br>
and the hydrogen released combines with oxygen to form water-<br>
Part of the feedstock usually is oxidized completely to form<br>
carbon dioxide and/or carbon monoxide, and another part is<br>
converted to other organic substances. The oxygen reguired<br>
for the oxidation reaction is withdrawn from the carrier gas<br>
(usually ambient air preheated in a heat exchanger) . Due to<br>
the various oxidation reactions, the entire process is highly<br>
exothermal. In accordance with the invention, e.g. phthalic<br>
anhydride, maleic anhydride is generated from butane or ben-<br>
zene, acrylic acid is generated from propylene, and acetic<br>
acid is generated from C4 hydrocarbons or anthraquinone.<br>
A typical product generated according to this principle in<br>
large amounts all over the world is phthalic anhydride from a<br>
feed mixture which contains orthoxylene or naphthalene and<br>
molecular oxygen in the concentration usual for ambient air<br>
or increased by additional enrichment. The generation of<br>
phthalic anhydride is effected at temperatures in the range<br>
from 200 to 500°C in a reactor containing a catalyst, through<br>
which reactor flows a cooling fluid and from which reactor<br>
gaseous product mixture containing phthalic anhydride vapor<br>
is withdrawn. This generation of phthalic anhydride will be<br>
represented below by way of example for all organic products<br>
to be generated by partial catalytic oxidation in the gas<br>
phase, where it is also possible to use a plurality of se-<br>
ries-connected reactors.<br>
Such process employing a multi-tube reactor is known from<br>
U.S. patent 4,592,412. The reactor comprises a multitude of<br>
vertical tubes in which the granular catalyst is disposed.<br>
The catalyst on the basis of vanadium pentoxide may also be<br>
formed of carrier elements coated with a catalytic mass. A<br>
cooling fluid flows around the outside of the numerous tubes<br>
containing the catalyst, in order to dissipate the heat re-<br>
leased by the exothermal reaction. In the known process mol-<br>
ten salt is preferably used as cooling fluid, which requires<br>
complex and therefore expensive apparatuses.<br>
Apart from high investment costs, the multi—tube reactor de-<br>
scribed above is also problematic for various other reasons.<br>
Due to the high weight and large dimensions of the reactor<br>
(150 to 250 t and 7 to 9 m diameter alone for the tube bundle<br>
with usual reactor sizes), cost-intensive special transports<br>
are required. Required pre-material in non-commercial dimen-<br>
sions as well as labor-intensive manufacture lead to long de-<br>
livery times in the manufacture of the reactor. The random<br>
bed of the catalyst in the individual tubes causes a large<br>
pressure loss on the gas side in conjunction with a high con-<br>
sumption of energy for the conveyance of the feed gas. in ad-<br>
dition, this type of construction involves a number of fur-<br>
ther, mostly process- or reaction-related problems which will<br>
be discussed in detail below.<br>
Modern high-performance catalysts require very uniform tem-<br>
peratures to evolve a high selectivity and to achieve a long<br>
service life. The admissible temperature difference of the<br>
cooling fluid inside the space surrounding the tubes there-<br>
fore is closely limited. In the known process, this requires<br>
large recirculation flow rates of the cooling fluid in con-<br>
junction with a high energy consumption and high investment<br>
costs for the recirculation pumps.<br>
Typically, in all known oxidation processes employing a reac-<br>
tor with stationarily incorporated catalyst (fixed bed) the<br>
conversion of the feedstock into the end product and the re-<br>
lated development of heat over the entire catalyst packing is<br>
effected very nonuniformly, as it is noted that for instance<br>
in the phthalic anhydride process more than 90 % of the reac-<br>
tion heat are produced on the inlet-side half of the catalyst<br>
packing (main reaction zone). In the reactor according to the<br>
known process, reaction temperatures far above the tempera-<br>
ture of the tube wall are obtained in the catalyst of the<br>
main reaction zone due to the poor heat transfer between<br>
catalyst and tube wall, whereas in the outlet-side half of<br>
the catalyst packing-(secondary reaction zone) the reaction<br>
temperature is very close to that of the cooling fluid. In<br>
the inlet-side half of the catalyst there is mostly formed<br>
what is called a hot spot, whose temperature can come close<br>
to the self-ignition temperature of the product. Even with<br>
minor variations of the reaction conditions there is thus a<br>
risk of an ignition of the gas with a partial or total damage<br>
of the catalyst due to overheating. At high temperatures in<br>
the catalyst a feedback effect can in addition accelerate the<br>
process of overheating, as experience has shown that with in-<br>
creasing reaction temperature the activity of the catalyst<br>
and hence the amount of oxidized feedstock is increasing,<br>
where the additional generation of heat can easily lead to<br>
the self-ignition temperature of the gas being reached. In<br>
addition, with increasing activity the selectivity of the<br>
catalyst is decreased, i.e. the product yield is decreased<br>
and more byproducts are formed.<br>
For an economic production of phthalic anhydride there should<br>
advantageously be used a reactor feed gas with a rather high<br>
concentration of feedstock. For plants of the same perform-<br>
ance smaller and thus less expensive apparatuses can be used.<br>
In the known process, however, the above-described risk of<br>
the over-reaction of the catalyst impedes an increase in con-<br>
centration to the extent desirable for such economy.<br>
It is the object underlying the invention to further develop<br>
the above-mentioned process and increase the product yield<br>
with improved operational safety and less expensive opera-<br>
tion. It should be possible to employ not only one reactor,<br>
but also a plurality of series-connected reactors, in order<br>
to be able to expand e.g. existing plants.<br>
In accordance with the invention this is achieved in that at<br>
least one reactor constitutes a cooling-tube reactor with<br>
cooling tubes through which flows a cooling fluid, where in<br>
the cooling-tube reactor 40 to 100 wt-% of the total amount<br>
of the catalyst are disposed as coating on the outside of the<br>
cooling tubes, and the feed mixture containing the feedstock<br>
and the molecular oxygen gets in contact with the catalyst<br>
layers. Part of the entire amount of catalyst may also be<br>
provided on uncooled surfaces in the cooling-tube reactor.<br>
Another essential aspect of the invention consists in that<br>
for dissipating the reaction heat in the cooling-tube reactor<br>
an evaporable liquid is used instead of the molten salt com-<br>
monly used in the known tubular reactor, e.g. diphyl may be<br>
used as cooling fluid. Subsequently, reference is made in<br>
part to the production of phthalic anhydride, but the expla-<br>
nations are analogously true for the production of other sub-<br>
stances.<br>
Preferably, at least half the cooling tubes in the cooling-<br>
tube reactor are designed as ribbed tubes with ribs protrud-<br>
ing on the outside, the ribs being at least partly coated<br>
with catalyst. By using ribbed tubes instead of smooth tubes,<br>
the catalytically active surface can be increased considera-<br>
bly without increasing the tube diameter or the number of<br>
tubes. Expediently, it is ensured that at least 10 wt-% of<br>
the entire amount of catalyst are applied on the ribs as<br>
coating. The catalyst coatings mostly have layer thicknesses<br>
in the range from 0.05 to 5 mm.<br>
Coating the cooling tubes with catalyst mass provides an im-<br>
proved heat transfer from the catalyst onto and through the<br>
tube wall to the cooling fluid. In the main reaction zone of<br>
the cooling-tube reactor, the high reaction temperatures un-<br>
favorable for the known process can thus be reduced consid-<br>
erably.<br>
Another advantage of the cooling-tube reactor consists in<br>
that by using tubes ribbed on the outside, the gas-side heat<br>
exchanging surface can be increased economically to a multi-<br>
ple of the usual surface area of the reactors used in the<br>
known process. By increasing the surface area, the reaction<br>
heat can be dissipated more easily and with a reduced tem-<br>
perature gradient, which leads to an additional decrease of<br>
the reaction temperatures. By decreasing the reaction tem-<br>
peratures, the selectivity of the catalyst and thus the prod-<br>
uct yield can usually be increased during oxidation reac-<br>
tions. The operational safety is increased to the extent in<br>
which the distance between catalyst temperature and self-<br>
ignition temperature of the gas can be increased.<br>
Another considerable advantage of the decrease of the reac-<br>
tion temperature as described in the two preceding paragraphs<br>
consists in the possibility of increasing the concentration<br>
of the feedstock in the carrier gas far above the concentra-<br>
tions possible in the known process without a risk of overre-<br>
action, as the reaction temperature can be kept at a suffi-<br>
ciently safe distance from the self-ignition temperature of<br>
the gas. The resulting reduction of the amount of carrier gas<br>
to be conveyed also results in a saving of energy for the op-<br>
eration of the carrier gas blower, for the preheating of the<br>
carrier gas and, when cooling the product mixture, to a depo-<br>
sition of product.<br>
An additional saving of energy is obtained by the inventive<br>
arrangement of the catalyst mass on the rib surfaces of the<br>
cooling tubes. This leads to a considerable reduction of the<br>
gas-side pressure loss over the entire cooling-tube reactor<br>
as compared to the principle of the random packing with cata-<br>
lyst bodies, which is commonly used in the known multi-tube<br>
reactor. Apart from the above-described saving of energy<br>
there is also obtained a reduction of costs in the blower and<br>
its drive required for conveying the carrier gas; due to the<br>
lower conveying pressure, the blower may be of a simpler and<br>
less expensive construction, and the drive may be designed<br>
smaller due to the lower demand of energy.<br>
In the cooling-tube reactor, the exchange of old, spent cata-<br>
lyst against new catalyst can be performed within a shorter<br>
period than in the multi-tube reactor, in which each tube<br>
must be filled individually with high accuracy, in the prin-<br>
ciple underlying the invention, the individual tube bundles<br>
can be designed withdrawable from the reactor, whereby tube<br>
bundles with spent catalyst can be replaced by newly coated<br>
tube bundles in a time- and cost-saving way. The with-<br>
drawability of the bundles also facilitates the removal of<br>
the spent catalyst mass and the subsequent new coating, which<br>
can be performed without a standstill of the reactor for in-<br>
stance in the factory of the catalyst manufacturer. The tube<br>
bundles can easily be fabricated in a standard size, whereby<br>
it is possible to reuse the newly coated bundles in a reactor<br>
of another plant operator.<br>
In view of the great reaction heat obtained in the inlet por-<br>
tion of the reactor, it is of considerable importance for the<br>
economy of the inventive process to keep the number of the<br>
cooling tubes at a minimum. This is achieved e.g. by using a<br>
material with a higher thermal conductivity than steel (e.g.<br>
copper) for the ribs in the main reaction zone. As a result,<br>
relatively large ribs of smaller thickness can be used,<br>
whereby small temperature differences between rib edge and<br>
inner tube can be achieved.<br>
In the secondary reaction zone of the cooling-tube reactor,<br>
where considerably less reaction heat is obtained, steel ribs<br>
of the same dimension as in the main reaction zone may, how-<br>
ever, be used. This has the additional advantage of equal<br>
geometric conditions in all parts of the reactor.<br>
For the heat transfer properties of a ribbed tube, the shape<br>
of the individual rib is also important apart from the dimen-<br>
sions and the material. A round rib for instance has a more<br>
favorable temperature distribution than a rib of square or<br>
rectangular shape. Therefore, this shape is particularly<br>
suited for zones of the reactor with a high thermal load. In<br>
the case of a square or rectangular shape, however, larger<br>
heat-exchanging surfaces per unit volume can be accommodated.<br>
This is in turn advantageous in zones with a lower thermal<br>
load. When using rectangular ribs, it may be advantageous to<br>
choose rib length and width for instance in a ratio 2 : 1, so<br>
that each rib can be connected with both legs of the U-tube.<br>
Under an extremely high thermal load, a rib of variable<br>
thickness may also be advantageous, i.e. the rib thickness<br>
then is largest close to the inner tube and constantly de-<br>
creases towards the edge.<br>
In particular in the outlet region of the cooling-tube reac-<br>
tor, it is not necessary at all points that the catalyst be<br>
cooled intensively by a cooling fluid. Therefore, it may be<br>
expedient and economic when 5 to 40 wt—% of the entire amount<br>
of catalyst are provided on uncooled surfaces of metal or<br>
other suitable materials. It may be advantageous to alter-<br>
nately pass the reaction gas over uncooled and cooled cata—<br>
lytically coated surfaces.<br>
One of the main advantages when using an evaporable cooling<br>
fluid in the cooling-tube reactor as compared to the molten<br>
salt commonly used in the known multi-tube reactor is the<br>
uniform temperature, which only depends on the pressure of<br>
the fluid, while at the same time having a better heat trans-<br>
fer. Since the absorption of heat is advantageously effected<br>
by evaporation and not by an increase in temperature as in<br>
the case of molten salt, the recirculation flow rate of the<br>
cooling fluid does not play a major role as long as at least<br>
so much liquid is supplied to each cooling tube as must be<br>
evaporated for the required dissipation of heat.<br>
When the recirculated cooling fluid is distributed over the<br>
individual cooling tubes, the behavior of the fluid described<br>
below may turn out problematic:<br>
Due to the different amount of cooling fluid to be evaporated<br>
in the cooling tubes of different reaction zones, different<br>
pressure losses are formed in the interior of the cooling<br>
tubes, where in zones of high heat: transfer with much genera-<br>
tion of vapor a high pressure loss is obtained, and in zones<br>
of low heat transfer with little generation of vapor a low<br>
pressure loss is obtained. When all cooling tubes on the side<br>
of the coolant are arranged in parallel, there is obtained<br>
less flow through the tubes with much generation of vapor<br>
than through tubes with little generation of vapor. For the<br>
process, a higher flow through tubes with much generation of<br>
vapor is, however, more advantageous than in the case of<br>
tubes with little generation of vapor. Expediently, this is<br>
achieved by using flow restrictors of a different flow resis-<br>
tance on the inlet or outlet side of each individual tube.<br>
The flow resistance of the flow restrictors is expediently<br>
adapted to the expected generation of vapor in the respective<br>
tube.<br>
Another advantage of using an evaporable cooling fluid con-<br>
sists in that upon separation of the liguid phase in the<br>
steam drum, the vapors of the cooling fluid formed in the<br>
cooling tubes can be used in other parts of the phthalic an-<br>
hydride plant. What is particularly advantageous is the high<br>
temperature level of the available vapor. Complex and expen-<br>
sive heating means, e.g. an electric heating or a fired,<br>
separate heat transfer system, which must be designed for<br>
temperatures of at least 300°C, can easily be replaced<br>
thereby. This results in considerable savings in the invest-<br>
ment and operating costs.<br>
It may be advantageous for the process to operate the various<br>
reaction zones at different temperatures. This may be ef-<br>
fected e.g. by connecting the reactor to two or more separate<br>
cooling systems. The cooling fluid may be of the same or of a<br>
different composition of substances.<br>
The feed mixture may flow through the cooling-tube reactor<br>
substantially horizontally or substantially vertically (from<br>
the top to the bottom or vice versa). When the reactor is de-<br>
signed with vertical flow, space is saved and the cooling<br>
tubes may be designed as U-tubes without a welding seam to-<br>
wards the gas space and be welded in the reactor such that in<br>
the case of a leakage of a welding seam no cooling fluid can<br>
get into the gas space.<br>
The cooling-tube reactor can be used alone or connected in<br>
series with one or more other reactors, which can be provided<br>
before and/or behind the cooling reactor. Only as an example,<br>
the multi-tube reactor, the fluidized-bed reactor and the<br>
liquid-phase reactor should be mentioned here.<br>
Embodiments of the process employing a cooling-tube reactor<br>
will be explained with reference to the drawing. Reference is<br>
made to the production of phthalic anhydride, but another<br>
substance may also be generated analogously.<br>
In the drawing<br>
Fig. 1 shows a flow diagram of the process,<br>
Fig. 2 shows a longitudinal section of a cooling tube por-<br>
tion in an enlarged representation,<br>
Fig. 3 shows a flow diagram of the process with two sepa-<br>
rate cooling circuits, and<br>
Fig. 4 shows a flow diagram of the process with two reac-<br>
tors.<br>
In the cooling-tube reactor (1) as shown in Fig. 1, the va-<br>
porous feed mixture, which contains orthoxylene or naphtha-<br>
lene and molecular oxygen, flows through the upper inlet (2).<br>
In the reactor, the catalyst (5) is disposed as coating on<br>
the outside of numerous cooling tubes (3) for at least<br>
40 wt-%, cf. Figs. 3 and 4, onto which cooling tubes ring-<br>
shaped ribs (4) are welded. In Fig. 2, such tube portion is<br>
shown, which on the outside is provided with the catalyst,<br>
coating (5) indicated as dots.<br>
The reactor (1) of Fig. 1 has a preheating zone (6), a main<br>
reaction zone (7) and a secondary reaction zone (8), each<br>
having slightly different temperatures. Through these zones,<br>
the feed mixture flows downwards and past the catalyst-coated<br>
tubes. The vaporous product mixture, which contains phthalic<br>
anhydride vapor, leaves the reactor (1) through the outlet<br>
(10) and is then cooled in a manner known per se and not rep-<br>
resented here (e.g. U.S. patent 4,592,412).<br>
All zones (6, 7, 8) have bundles of ribbed tubes (3), through<br>
which flows cooling fluid. Beside the cooled tubes, there are<br>
also uncooled metallic or non-metallic surfaces (9) with<br>
catalyst coating, which above all belong to the secondary re-<br>
action zone (8). The bundles of the preheating zone (6) in<br>
the inlet region of the reactor (1) may, however, selectively<br>
be coated catalytically or be uncoated.<br>
The individual tube bundles may either be withdrawably incor-<br>
porated in the reactor or be welded to the same. The various<br>
parts of a tube bundle are for instance inseparably connected<br>
with each other, and the catalyst coating is performed at the<br>
finished bundle, which is not represented in detail in the<br>
drawing. The largest part of the length of the cooling tubes<br>
extends horizontally inside the reactor corresponding to a<br>
lying U-shape of the tubes, whereby welds in the gas space<br>
are avoided. The problem of thermal stresses due to thermal<br>
expansion is also largely avoided thereby.<br>
The cooling fluid comes as liquid from line (11) from a steam<br>
drum (13) and by means of the pump (12) is distributed over<br>
the various tubes via lines (lla to lle). Expediently, the<br>
cooling fluid enters the cooling tubes (3) from below as liq-<br>
uid and partly evaporates in the cooling tubes, whereby the<br>
heat of evaporation is utilized for cooling. As suitable<br>
cooling fluid, diphyl may for instance be used, a synthetic<br>
heat transfer oil. Partly evaporated cooling fluid leaves the<br>
tubes (3) through lines (14a to 14e) and flows through line<br>
(14) to the steam drum (13).<br>
Cooling fluid vapor escapes in line (15) through the throttle<br>
valve (16) and is cooled in a heat exchanger (17). The con-<br>
densate formed flows to an intermediate container (19) via<br>
line (18) and is then recirculated to the steam drum (13)<br>
through the pump (20) and line (21). A pressure control (22)<br>
monitors the pressure in the steam drum (13) and keeps it ap-<br>
proximately constant at a predetermined value, the throttle<br>
valve (16) being actuated if necessary via the signal line<br>
(23). By means of the approximately constant pressure, the<br>
temperature of the liquid cooling fluid in line (11) and of<br>
the partly evaporated cooling fluid in the cooling tubes (3)<br>
is kept at the desired temperature, which usually lies in the<br>
range from about 300 to 400°C, when diphyl is used as cooling<br>
fluid.<br>
When two reactors are employed, e.g. when a plant is ex-<br>
panded, the other reactor is disposed either before the inlet<br>
(2) or behind the outlet (10) of the cooling-tube reactor<br>
(1).<br>
Fig. 3 shows the same reactor as Fig. 1, but which now is<br>
connected to two separate cooling circuits. The secondary re-<br>
action zone (8) of the reactor can thereby be operated at<br>
temperatures which are independent of the temperatures of the<br>
main reaction zone (7). As is represented in Fig. 1, the<br>
cooling tubes (3) of the main reaction zone (7) are provided<br>
with cooling fluid via lines (lle to lie) from the steam drum<br>
(13). The cooling tubes (3) of the secondary reaction zone<br>
(8), however, contain cooling fluid from the second steam<br>
drum (26), and the temperatures of the cooling fluids in the<br>
two steam drums (13 and 26) may be different. Partly evapo-<br>
rated and unevaporated cooling fluid flows through lines<br>
(27a, 27b) into the collecting line (27) and from there into<br>
the steam drum (26). The pressurization of the steam drums<br>
(13 and 26), the condensation and recirculation of the con-<br>
densed cooling fluid are effected in the same way as de-<br>
scribed already in conjunction with Fig. 1.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the process, part of the<br>
reaction heat generated is utilized for heating means of the<br>
phthalic anhydride plant which are disposed outside the reac-<br>
tor region, for instance in the thermal pretreatment and in<br>
the distillation of the crude phthalic anhydride. For this<br>
purpose, cooling fluid may selectively be withdrawn as vapor<br>
via line (15a) or as liquid via line (llf) and be supplied to<br>
the means to be heated. The condensed vapor or the cooled<br>
liquid is subsequently recirculated into the reactor cooling<br>
circuit via line (18a).<br>
Fig. 4 shows a similar cooling-tube reactor (1) as Fig. 1,<br>
but without the preheating zone (6) and the main reaction<br>
zone (7). Before this cooling-tube reactor, another reactor<br>
is provided, in the present case a multi-tube reactor of a<br>
conventional type, in which the preheating of the feed gas<br>
and the main reaction take place. This other reactor is re-<br>
ferred to as tubular reactor in the further description of<br>
Fig. 4 and in Example 2.<br>
In this tubular reactor (31), the vaporous feed mixture which<br>
contains orthoxylene or naphthalene and molecular oxygen<br>
flows through the inlet (32). In the tubular reactor (31),<br>
the catalyst (34) is disposed in granular form inside numer-<br>
ous indirectly cooled tubes (33).<br>
For dissipating heat and for temperature control a cooling<br>
fluid is used, for instance a molten salt which enters the<br>
lower part of the tubular reactor (31) via line (35), flows<br>
through said lower part on the outside of the tubes and<br>
leaves the same again at the upper end via line (36). A de-<br>
tailed representation and description of the means for con-<br>
veying and recooling the cooling fluid is omitted here, as it<br>
is known.<br>
The tubular reactor (31) has a preheating zone (6) and a main<br>
reaction zone (7). Through these zones, the feed mixture<br>
flows downwards inside the tubes (33) filled with catalyst<br>
(34). The vaporous product mixture, which contains phthalic<br>
anhydride vapor and also considerable amounts of unreacted<br>
feedstock as well as possible intermediate products, leaves<br>
the tubular reactor (31) through the outlet (37) and flows<br>
through line (38) to the cooling-tube reactor (1) for further<br>
reaction.<br>
Into the reactor (1), the vaporous mixture from the tubular<br>
reactor (31) flows through the upper inlet (2). In the reac-<br>
tor (1), the catalyst is at least partly disposed on the out-<br>
side of numerous cooling tubes (3), as described in conjunc-<br>
tion with Fig. 1. In contrast to Fig. 1, the reactor (1) of<br>
Fig. 4 only has the secondary reaction zone (8), as the pre-<br>
heating zone (6) and the main reaction zone (7) are already<br>
disposed in the tubular reactor (31). The vaporous product<br>
mixture, which contains phthalic anhydride vapor, but is vir-<br>
tually free from unreacted feedstock or possible intermediate<br>
products, leaves the reactor (1) through the outlet (10) and<br>
is then cooled in a manner known per se, which is not repre-<br>
sented here (e.g. U.S. patent 4,592,412).<br>
The dissipation of heat and the temperature control of the<br>
reactor (1) of Fig. 4 are effected in the same way as de-<br>
scribed in Fig. 1 by means of a partly evaporated cooling<br>
fluid.<br>
Example 1:<br>
There is employed a procedure comprising only one reactor<br>
corresponding to Fig. 1. The cooling-tube reactor (1) is de-<br>
signed for an hourly volume flow of air preheated to 180°C in<br>
an amount of 60,000 m3 in the normal condition, which air is<br>
mixed with 6000 kg orthoxylene as feedstock in the vaporous<br>
condition. The temperature of the gas mixture entering the<br>
reactor through the inlet (2) is 150°C. The orthoxylene used<br>
is reacted in the main reaction zone (7) for 90 %, and the<br>
rest is reacted in the secondary reaction zone (8) to obtain<br>
the end product phthalic anhydride and the byproducts.<br>
The reactor is disposed vertical, the gas entering from<br>
above. The reactor has a rectangular shape with a width of<br>
3200 mm and a depth of 3100 mm, the height is about 6 m, the<br>
overall heights of the gas-side hoods at the inlet and outlet<br>
being included therein. Inside the reactor, there are each<br>
disposed two ribbed-tube heat exchanger bundles at the same<br>
level one beside the other. The entering gas mixture first of<br>
all flows through the preheating zone (6), which is made of a<br>
pair of U-shaped ribbed-tube heat exchanger bundles made of<br>
steel and arranged in parallel, and is thereby heated to<br>
250°C. Liquid diphyl flows through the tubes (3) of the bun-<br>
dles, which diphyl enters the tubes (lle) with a temperature<br>
of 370°C and when flowing through the tubes is cooled to<br>
about 320°C at the outlet (14e).<br>
The preheated feed gas subsequently flows through the main<br>
reaction zone (7), which consists of 15 pairs of U-shaped<br>
ribbed-tube heat exchanger bundles arranged in parallel,<br>
which on their outer surface are coated with a catalytic<br>
mass. The same chiefly consists of vanadium pentoxide and ti-<br>
tanium dioxide. During the contact of the gas mixture with<br>
the catalyst, the orthoxylene contained therein reacts with<br>
the oxygen likewise contained therein to form phthalic anhy-<br>
dride and other byproducts, reaction heat being released.<br>
Through the inside of the tubes (3), diphyl is flowing, which<br>
absorbs the reaction heat by evaporation, whereby the cata-<br>
lyst temperature can be maintained. Each bundle is equipped<br>
with 21 U-tubes (3) arranged in parallel. The U-shaped ribbed<br>
tubes have an outside diameter of 30 mm and a wall thickness<br>
of 2 mm, the straight tube length is 3.0 m. The ribs have an<br>
outside diameter of 60 and a thickness of 0.5 mm. The ma-<br>
terial for ribs and inner tubes is copper. The distance be-<br>
tween two adjacent ribs is 1.5 mm, so that each U-tube has<br>
3000 ribs. The rib surface area of each bundle provided with<br>
a catalytic coating is 273.1 m2.<br>
The thermal output of all ribbed tubes of the main reaction<br>
zone (7), which will be dissipated in the case of an expected<br>
90 % conversion of the orthoxylene used, is about 22.600 kw.<br>
Due to the required tenperature differences with respect to<br>
the heat transfer inside the tube wall and in the rib as well<br>
as between tube wall and the evaporating diphyl, the tempera-<br>
ture increases from the inside of the tube to the rib edge.<br>
In this example it is 370°C for the evaporating liquid, 374°C<br>
for the rib at the rib base, and 384°C at the rib edge. Due<br>
to a favorable arrangement of each pair of bundles, each off-<br>
set by 180°C, with respect to the one preceding in the gas<br>
stream and the succeeding one, the overall height of the en-<br>
tire main reaction zone is 1950 mm.<br>
The reaction gas mixture subsequently flows through the sec-<br>
ondary reaction zone (8), in which the remaining orthoxylene<br>
is converted. The reaction heat generated is about 2500 kW.<br>
The secondary reaction zone consists of 20 ribbed-tube heat<br>
exchanger bundles and 10 elements without cooling of honey-<br>
comb-shaped catalytically coated monolithic ceramic bodies<br>
(9). As regards design, dimension and arrangement, the<br>
ribbed-tube heat exchanger bundles are largely identical with<br>
the bundles used for the main reaction zone (7) with the dif-<br>
ference that for the secondary reaction zone the thickness of<br>
the ribs is 1 mm and the bundles are completely made of<br>
steel. Like in the main reaction zone, the bundles are offset<br>
in pairs. After the bottommost 5 pairs of bundles there is<br>
each provided a layer of uncooled elements of monolithic bod-<br>
ies.<br>
The diphyl recirculation pump (12) sucks in the liquid diphyl<br>
required for the individual reactor zones from a steam drum<br>
(13), which is mounted at a level of 11 m above the pump. As<br>
required, it supplies different amounts of liquid diphyl to<br>
the individual reactor zones, namely 100 m3/h to the preheat-<br>
ing zone, 2000 m3/h to the main reaction zone and 200 ma/h to<br>
the secondary reaction zone.<br>
The diphyl emerging from the bundles of the individual reac-<br>
tor zones partly in liquid form, partly in vaporous form is<br>
recirculated to the steam drum (13) via a common collecting<br>
line (14). In the steam drum, vapor phase and liquid phase<br>
are separated from each other, and the liquid is available<br>
for another recirculation. The pressure in the steam drum is<br>
7.5 bar, which corresponds to a saturated steam temperature<br>
of 370°C. The amount of diphyl vapor discharged via line (15)<br>
is 400.000 kg/h.<br>
The vaporous diphyl discharged from the steam drum (13)<br>
through line (15) is largely reliquefied in several condens-<br>
ers (17), collected in the container (19) and recirculated to<br>
the steam drum (13) via the pump (20).<br>
In one of the condensers, the condensation heat is used for<br>
generating saturated steam of 51 bar. In another condenser<br>
connected in parallel thereto, the saturated steam thus gen-<br>
erated is superheated to a temperature of 330°C and is thus<br>
available for driving a steam turbine. By means of the heat<br>
transferred per hour by the condensation of 400,000 kg diphyl<br>
vapor, about 37 tons of superheated steam are thus generated.<br>
For heating the distillation of the crude phthalic anhydride<br>
with a heat requirement of 2000 kW, another part of vaporous<br>
cooling fluid is withdrawn in an amount of 32,000 kg/h. The<br>
cooling fluid condensed in the heat—consuming devices flows<br>
back through line (18a) into the coolant system of the reac-<br>
tor.<br>
Example 2:<br>
There is employed a procedure corresponding to Fig. 4. The<br>
two reactors (31) and (1) are designed for a volume flow of<br>
carrier gas (preheated ambient air) of 60.000 Nm3/h, which<br>
carrier gas is loaded with orthoxylene in an amount of 7200<br>
kg/h as feedstock in the vaporous condition. The temperature<br>
of the gas mixture entering the tubular reactor (31) through<br>
the inlet (32) is 143°C.<br>
The tubular reactor (31) has 15,000 vertically arranged steel<br>
tubes (33) with an inside diameter of 25 mm and a length of<br>
3.4 m. The catalyst (34) inside the tubes has a filling level<br>
of 3.1 m and consists of ring-shaped carrier bodies of an in-<br>
ert ceramic material with a diameter of 7 mm and a length of<br>
7 mm, which are provided with a thin layer of catalytic mate-<br>
rial, chiefly consisting of vanadium pentoxide.<br>
The gas mixture of preheated air and vaporous orthoxylene,<br>
which is used as feedstock, enters the tubes (33) from above<br>
with a temperature of 144"C. When flowing through the upper,<br>
catalyst-free part of the tubes with a length of about 150 mm<br>
and the uppermost 100 mm of the catalyst packing, the gas is<br>
heated in the preheating zone (6) to a reaction temperature<br>
of 330°C.<br>
Due to the subsequently starting reaction, the gas is heated<br>
even more and upon exceeding the cooling fluid temperature of<br>
350°C dissipates heat to the tube wall. At a level of 500 mm<br>
below the inlet of the catalyst bed, the gas reaches its<br>
highest temperature of 410°C (hot spot). Below the hot spot,<br>
the gas is cooled again and upon leaving the tubes (33)<br>
reaches a temperature of 360°C.<br>
Upon contact of the gas mixture used with the catalyst (34)<br>
in the main reaction zone (7) , the orthoxylene contained<br>
therein reacts to form phthalic anhydride and other byprod-<br>
ucts, reaction heat being released. The reaction conditions<br>
are such that about 10 % of the orthoxylene used leave the<br>
tubular reactor (31) unreacted together with the reaction gas<br>
via line (38).<br>
The thermal output to be dissipated from the reactor (31) by<br>
the cooling fluid in the case of an expected 90 % conversion<br>
of the orthoxylene used is about 18.000 kW.<br>
The cooling-tube reactor (1) is arranged vertically, as is<br>
represented in Fig. 4, the gas mixture entering from above.<br>
This reactor has a rectangular shape with a width of 3.2 m<br>
and a depth of 3.1 m, and the height is about 4 m, the over-<br>
all heights of the gas-side hoods at the inlet and at the<br>
outlet being included. Inside the reactor (1), two ribbed-<br>
tube heat exchanger bundles (3) or two uncooled elements (9)<br>
are each disposed one beside the other at the same level, as<br>
will be described in detail further below.<br>
The reaction gas from the tubular reactor (31) flows around<br>
the bundles (3) and the uncooled elements (9) in the cooling-<br>
tube reactor (1). Both the bundles and the elements are<br>
coated on their surface with a catalytic mass. When the gas<br>
mixture gets in contact with the catalyst, the orthoxylene<br>
contained therein and the intermediate products formed in the<br>
tubular reactor (31) react with the oxygen likewise contained<br>
therein to form phthalic anhydride and other byproducts, re-<br>
action heat being released. The reaction heat generated in<br>
the reactor (1) is about 3000 kW.<br>
The reactor (1) has 20 ribbed-tube heat exchanger bundles (3)<br>
and 10 elements (9) formed of honeycomb-shaped monolithic ce-<br>
ramic bodies without cooling. The U-shaped ribbed tubes (3)<br>
of the bundles are provided on their outer surface with a<br>
catalytic coating, the nonolithic bodies of the elements (9)<br>
being provided on the inside of the honeycombs. In both of<br>
them, the catalytic mass largely consists of vanadium pentox-<br>
ide.<br>
The bundles are arranged in pairs. After the bottommost 5<br>
pairs of bundles there is each provided a layer of uncooled<br>
elements (9) of monolithic bodies, which are likewise ar-<br>
ranged in pairs.<br>
Diphyl flows through the inside of the tubes (3) of the bun-<br>
dles, which diphyl absorbs the reaction heat by evaporation,<br>
whereby the catalyst temperature can be maintained.<br>
Each bundle is fitted with 21 U-tubes (3) arranged in paral-<br>
lel. The U-shaped ribbed tubes have an outside diameter of 30<br>
mm and a wall thickness of 2 mm, the straight tube length is<br>
3.0 m. The ribs have an outside diameter of 60 mm and a<br>
thickness of 1 mm. The material for ribs and inner tubes is<br>
steel. The distance of two adjacent ribs is 1.5 mm, so that<br>
each U-tube has 2400 ribs. The catalytically coated rib sur-<br>
face of each bundle is 218.5 m2.<br>
Due to the required temperature differences for heat transfer<br>
inside the tube wall and in the rib as well as between tube<br>
wall and the diphyl to be evaporated, the temperature in-<br>
creases from the inside of the tube to the rib edge. In this<br>
example it is 350°C for the evaporating liquid, 350.5°C for<br>
the rib at the rib base, and 360°C at the rib edge.<br>
The uncooled elements consist of catalytically coated honey-<br>
comb-shaped monolithic elements with an edge length of 150 x<br>
150 x 150 mm. Since the reaction heat released in the honey-<br>
combs is not dissipated, the gas is heated by 1 to 5°C when<br>
flowing through a monolithic element. This elevated tempera-<br>
ture is decreased again when the gas flows through the subse-<br>
quent cooled bundle by releasing heat at the ribbed tubes.<br>
Due to a favorable arrangement of each pair of bundles offset<br>
by 180° with respect to the one preceding and succeeding in<br>
the gas stream, the overall height of the entire reaction<br>
zone (8) is 2.1 m.<br>
The liquid diphyl required for cooling the reactor tubes is<br>
sucked in by the diphyl recirculation pump (12) from a steam<br>
drum (13), which is mounted at a level of 10 m above the<br>
pump. It conveys 250 m3/h.<br>
The diphyl emerging from the bundles via lines (14a) and<br>
(14b) partly in liquid form, partly in vaporous form is re-<br>
circulated to the steam drum (13) via a common collecting<br>
line (14). In the steam drum, vapor phase and liquid phase<br>
are separated from each other, and the liquid is available<br>
for another recirculation. By means of a throttle valve (16)<br>
in the vapor outlet line (15), which is actuated by a pres-<br>
sure controller (22) via a pulse line (23), the pressure in<br>
the steam drum is constantly maintained at a pressure of 5.6<br>
bar, which corresponds to the saturated steam temperature of<br>
350°C. The amount of diphyl vapor discharged via line (15) is<br>
about 45.000 kg/h. The discharge pressure of the pump for<br>
overcoming the flow resistances in the bundles with the in-<br>
corporated throttle bodies as well as in the tube lines sup-<br>
plying and discharging diphyl is 1 bar.<br>
The vaporous diphyl discharged from the steam drum (13)<br>
through line (15) is largely religuefied in a condenser (17),<br>
collected in the container (19) and recirculated to the steam<br>
drum (13) via the pump (20). The condensation heat is used<br>
for generating saturated steam of 51 bar. By means of the<br>
heat transferred by the condensation of 45.000 kg/h diphyl<br>
vapor, 4 t/h steam.are thus generated.<br>
