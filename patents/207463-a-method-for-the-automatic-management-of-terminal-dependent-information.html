A METHOD FOR THE AUTOMATIC MANAGEMENT OF TERMINAL-DEPENDENT INFORMATION<br>
Technical Area<br>
The present invention concerns, according to a first aspect, a method for the automatic management of terminal-dependent information in a wireless communication network.<br>
According to a second aspect, the present invention concerns at least one software product for the automatic management of information in a wireless communication network.<br>
Background to the Invention<br>
Mobile terminals are managed in wireless communication systems such as GSM and UMTS. These terminals satisfy the standards that are required in order to be approved in the communication system, but an ever-increasing part of the functionality is of such a nature that it is either not standardised at all, or at least not standardised in a unified manner. Furthermore, the terminals have different properties with respect to the ability to present information and with respect to the set of services built into the terminal.<br>
Certain parts of the settings relating to services are stored on SIM cards. It is possible for an operator to influence these before the subscription is purchased. The operator cannot normally influence the settings that are stored in the memory of the terminal before the subscriber has purchased the terminal (unless the terminal is intimately packaged with a certain specified subscription).<br>
Furthermore, subscribers change terminals while keeping an existing subscription. It is possible that the new terminal does not have the same abilities as the previous terminal.<br>
Manual configuration of services is generally currently required in order for these to be adapted to a particular type of terminal.<br>
This is often experienced as complicated by many users, and it is considered to be a contributory factor to the fact that certain services are seidom or never used. It is obvious that this is a significant disadvantage with existing solutions.<br><br>
WO 2004/004390	PCT/SE2003/001117<br>
2<br>
Each mobile unit in a wireless communication network such as GSM or UMTS has a unique identity. The terminal itself is aware of this identity and it is primarily intended to be used as theft-protection. The network can request the identity from the terminal during communication with the network before further communication is permitted.<br>
This terminal identity, IMEI, contains information about the manufacturer, model number, serial number and, in certain cases, also the current version of software.<br>
There is currently no possibility for an external service (that is, a service outside of BSC/RNC/MSC/SGSN) to request this identity.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
One part of the invention has the purpose of making this identity known to external services on request. The invention describes a number of possible methods for collecting information about the terminal identity.<br>
It is possible that it is undesirable for security reasons to expose the exact information concerning which unique terminal that is being used, and thus general information in the form of properties such as, for example, the model number are generated. The operator can choose, in order to increase the security further, to publish only generic subservices which means that the current terminal of the subscriber never leaves the domain of the operator.<br>
By correlating the identity of the terminal with information that is available in advance concerning the properties of different models, it is possible with the aid of the invention to present information about properties to services, which can automatically adapt information for the relevant terminal.<br>
It is the intention of the present invention to solve the problems described above. This is achieved according to a first aspect with a method for the automatic management of terminal-dependent information in a wireless communication network as specified in claim 1. The method comprises the following steps:<br>
-	the detection of the unique identity for the terminal that the subscriber is currently using;<br>
-	the adaptation of information for the type of terminal detected; and<br>
-	the presentation of the adapted information on the said terminal.<br><br>
WO 2004/004390	PCT/SE2003/001117<br>
3<br>
The need for manual configuration of services such that they are adapted to a certain type of terminal is reduced or eliminated with this method. A further advantage of the method is that registration of the terminal type used can be made in a database. This database can be used for tailored information for users with a particular type of terminal.<br>
A further advantage of the method is that it makes it possible to generate stimuli for external services during the exchange of terminal used by a subscriber.<br>
Furthermore, the method makes possible automatic migration of service profiles when the subscriber exchanges the terminal.<br>
A further advantage in this context is obtained if the step of detecting the type of terminal takes place through monitoring and probing signal links.<br>
A further advantage in this context is obtained if the step of detecting the type of terminal takes place through monitoring and probing signal links for the detection of MSISDN-IMSI mapping.<br>
A further advantage in this context is obtained if the method also comprises the steps:<br>
-	the request by the user of a service via SMS/USSD or conversation;<br>
-	the exchange of IMEI information between MSC and BSC/RNC or between SGSN and BSC/RNC for the subscriber,<br>
-	the capture of current IMEI information about the subscriber by probing the signal link;<br>
-	the detection by an application server of the request;<br>
-	the request by the application server for terminal properties from the configuration server;<br>
-	the discovery by the configuration server of a unique subscriber identity either by reading information that is stored locally or by a request to HLR.<br><br>
-	the reading by the configuration server of stored IMEI for the subscriber;<br>
-	the remapping by the configuration server of IMEI to properties;<br>
-	the return by the configuration server of the properties to the application server; and<br>
-	the transmission of a terminal-dependent configuration to the terminal via SMS or other information channel.<br>
According to one embodiment, a further advantage is obtained if the method further comprises the steps:<br><br>
WO 2004/004390	PCT/SE2003/001117<br>
4<br>
-	the request by the user of a service via SMS/USSD or conversation;<br>
-	the detection by an application server of the request;<br>
-	the request by the application server for properties;<br>
-	the request by the configuration server for IMEI via modified ATI or a new operation involving HLR.<br>
-   the request by HLR to the terminal for IMEI via MSC/SGSN;<br>
-	the remapping by the configuration server of IMEI to properties;<br>
-	the return by the configuration server of the properties to the application server; and<br>
-	the transmission of a terminal-dependent configuration to the terminal via SMS or other information channel.<br>
A further advantage is obtained in this context if the step in which HLR requests IMEI from the terminal occurs in two steps:<br>
-	the request by HLR to MSC/SGSN for IMEI for the subscriber; and<br>
-	the request by MSC/SGSN to the terminal for IMEI for the subscriber via BSC.<br>
A further advantage is obtained according to one embodiment if the method also comprises the steps:<br>
-	the request by the application server for properties from the configuration server;<br>
-	the discovery by the configuration server of the unique subscriber identity either by reading information that is stored locally or by an enquiry to HLR;<br>
-	the reading by the configuration server of stored IMEI for the subscriber;<br>
-	the contact by the configuration server to collaborating configuration servers if the IMEI information is not present in the local database, whereby the relevant collaborating configuration servers are determined by a request to HLR;<br><br>
-	the remapping by the configuration server of IMEI to properties;<br>
-	the conversion by the application server of terminal-independent information to terminal-dependent information; and<br>
-	the delivery of terminal-dependent information to the terminal.<br>
A further advantage is obtained in this context if the conversion step takes place based on attributes in the properties.<br><br>

The software product, at least one such, comprises software modules in order to carry out the steps according to the method according to the present invention, where the said product or products are run on the said computer, at least one such.<br>
The need for manual configuration of services in order for these to be suitable for a certain type of terminal is reduced or eliminated with this product or products.<br>
A further advantage of the software product is that the registration of the terminal type used can be made in a database. This database can be used for tailored information for users of a certain type of terminal.<br>
