The invention relates to an apparatus for reproducing a selected screen in a video compact disc (hereinafter referred to as "V-CD") reproducing<br>
system.<br>
Currently, audio/video infonnation data are recorded on video CD using Moving Picture Experts Group (hereinafter referred to as "MPEG"), which is regarded as the audio/video information recording media of a next-generation. MPEG is an international standard which has been established by experts of ISO/IEC, Joint Technical Committee (JTC). By using MPEG, a motion image that is about 74 minutes long can be stored on 12 cm diameter CD. The ISO/IEC, JTC was organized by ISO and lEC, which are international standardizing organizations for compressing and coding a digital motion image.<br>
Referring to FIG.l, a sector of recording data on the V-CD has a sync (12 bytes), a header (4 bytes), a sub-header (8 bytes) indicating the characteristics of the sector, user's data (2324 bytes), and an error detection code EDC (4 bytes). The user's data consists of many packs, each having an ISO 11172 layer. Each pack includes a system clock reference (hereinafter referred to as "SCR"), a sy.stem header, and many packets. A<br><br><br>
ime reference point of the pack is indicated in the SCR as the number of a clock. Each jacket has a packet start code and a stream recognizing code, a packet length, header data and the packet data. The header data includes a decoding time stamp (hereinafter referred .0 as "DTS"') for indicating a decoding starting time and a presentation time stamp [hereinafter referred to as "PTS"; represented by the number of the reference clqck) for ndicating a show starting time.<br>
MPEG decoder decodes packet data on the basis of control data, such as the SCR, the DTS, or the PTS, in the V-CD reproducing system for reproducing the recorded information in the V-CD recorded as described above.<br>
MPEG video data has three kinds of basic code screen data, which are called intra picture (hereinafter referred to as "1 picture") data, a predicted picture (hereinafter referred to as "P picture") data and a bi-directional predicted picau-e (hereinafter referred to as "B picture") data. As shown in FIG. 3, the I picture data are obtained by iornpressine and coding a still screen which is a reference picture when any further pictures are compressed and coded, That is, a standard picture is needed at first for coding Differential Pulse Code Modulation (DPCM), and the I picture serves as the reference picmre.<br>
The P picture is a predicted screen, which is the predicted screen that is the nearest to the original screen from an I picture or from the P picmre which has been previously generated as shown in FIG. 3.<br>
As shown in PIG. 3, the B picmre, which is also a predicted screen, may be is formed by predicting a picture in the forward direction while using the I picmre and the P picmre. However, the B picture may also be formed by predicting a picmre in the reverse direction while using the following I picture and P picmre, which composes an average<br><br>
picture by using the pictures predicted in the forward and the reverse-directions, and then selects the picture from these pictures which is the most similar to the original one. As a displaying and decoding method of the MPEG video data having the 1 picmre, the P picture, and the B picture, a forward reproducing mode, a forward slow speed reproducing mode, a forward high speed researching mode, and a backward high speed researching mode may be included. In the forward reproducing mode, the<br>
reproducing mode, the reproducing operation is performed at a slower speed than that of the forward reproducing mode. In the forward high speed researchmg mode, the forward search operation is performed at a high speed. In the backward high speed researchmg mode, the backward search operation is performed at a high speed. U.S. Patent No. 5,400,150. issued to Jong-Sam Woo, describes an embodiment of a selected screen reproducing method in a V-CD reproducing system.<br>
However, in order to watch a specific screen when an optical disc is being played, the user should stop the current operation, and go back to the position of the corresponding selected screen, and then reproduce the optical disc or set the pause mode and watch in detail the screen while the optical disc is being played. In such a case, when the number of the corresponding screens is one or two, the user can easily perform the reproducing operation. However, when the number of the corresponding screens is more than two. the user will have to manually operate the disc player to perform the reproducing operation.<br>

MPEG video decoder 461 decodes MPEG video signal 4412 from CD-ROM decoder 44, which is synchronized with the video synchronizing clock of about 90kHz, and outputs MPEG video signal 4611. Second D/A converting section 462 analog-converts MPEG video signal 4511 and outputs the analog-converted MPEG video signal 4621. RGB encoder 463 converts analog-converted MPEG video signal 4621 from second D/A converting section 462 mto a composite image signal 461 having R.G.B. color signals.<br>
As shown in FIG. 5, key input section 47 includes a power key 47a, a channel key .   47b for selecting a desired channel, a playback key 47c for reproducing optical disc 100, a slow speed playback key 47d for slowly reproducing optical disc 100, a forward/ backward high speed search key 47e for forward/backward searching optical disc 100 at a high speed, a specific screen memory key 47f for memorizing a specific screen, a last screen key 47g for selecting a last screen key and a specific screen playback key 47h for reproducing a specific screen, Key input section 47 generate.s commands for controlling operating menu.<br>
As shown in FIG. 6, a time information memory 45 writes and stores in second micom 472 time information (e.g. minute, second and sector number start code of I picture) of a selected screen under the control of first micom 471. FIG. 8 shows an example of data pattern which are stored in time information memory 45 shown in FIG. 4 by operating specific screen memory key 47f.<br>
FIG. 6 is a schematic diagram for explaining the data format of a picmre layer bit stream in the decoded MPEG video signal by the CD-ROM decoder shown in FIG. 4. The picture layer bit stream in the decoded MPEG video signal by the CD-ROM decoder has a picture start code (32bytes), a temporal reference (lObytes), and a picmre coding type (3bytes). In the picture coding type, I picmre, P picmre, B picmre, and D picmre<br><br>
may be seated as 001(2), 010(2), 011(2) and 100(2), respectively.<br>
FIG. 7 is a circuitry diagram for showing an embodiment of the I picture detection section 49 shown in FIG. 4. Referring to FIG. 7, an I picture detecting section 49 judges the type of a picture by detccthig a strat code and a picture coding type data of an I picture among MPEG video signal 4171, which is outputted from CD-ROM decoder 44. I picture detecting section 49 includes a first shift register 71, a second shift register 72, a third shift register 73, a first AND gate 74, a second AND gate 75, and a third AND gate 76.<br>
First shift register 71 receives from CD-ROM decoder 44 four picture star, codes (each of the codes is composed of 8 bytes), a temporal reference (10 bytes) and a picmre coding type (3 bytes) from an MPEG video data in tjje unit of a byte m order, and then outouts the output sicnal for the picmre start code, the output signal for the temporal reference and the output signal for the picture coding type data. Second and third shift registers 72 and 73 are connected with the output terminal of first shift register 71. Second and third shift registers 72 and 73 receive from first shift register 71 the outputs signal for picture start code and the output signal for temporal reference,  and outputs a picture start code detecting signal and a temporal reference detecting signal, respectively. First AND gate 74 logically combines the picmre start code detecting signal from second shift register 72 and the temporal reference detecting signal from third shift register 73, and outputs a first picture detecting signal 741.  Second AND gate 75 logically combines the picmre coding type signals 71111 from first shift register 71 and outputs a second<br>
picture  detecting signal 751.  Third  AND gate 74 and second picture detecting signal 751 from<br>
signal 741 supplied by first AND gate 74 and second picmre detecting signal 751 from second AND gate 75, and outputs the picmre coding type detecting signal 761.<br><br>
Second shift register 72 has a first register 721, a second register 722, a third register 723, and a fourth register 724. First register 721 latches a first code $00 of picture start code, which is inputted to first shift register 71 and is shifted through third shift register 73, fourth register 724, third register 723, and second register 722 of second shift register 72, and outputs the first code to first AND gate 74, as shown in FIG.6. Second register 722 latches a second code $00 of picture start code, which is inputted to first shift register 71 and is shifted through third shift register 73, fourth register 724, and third register of second shift register 72, and outputs the second code to first register 721 of second shift register 72, Third register 723 latches a third code SO1 of picture start code, which is inputted to first shift register 71 and is shifted through third shift register 73 and fourth register 724 of second shift register 72, and outputs the third code to second register 722 of second shift register 72. Fourth register 724 latches a fourth code SCO of the picture start code, which is inputted to first shift register 71 and is shifted through third shift register 73, and outputs the fourth code to third register 723 of second shift register 72.<br>
That is, I picture detecting section 46 detects the picture start codes (each of the codes is composed of 8 bytes) and the temporal reference (10 bytes), then detects the picture coding type (3bytes) which is outputted by following them, and thereby discriminates the kind of coding types of optical disc 100.<br>
A control section 40 has a first micom 401 and a second micom 402. Control section 40 temporarily stores time information of an I picture screen signal according to the I picture screen being detected by I picture detecting section 49, and stores in the time information memory 48 the temporarily stored time information of the I picture screen signal according to whether or not a specific screen memory mode is selected, then<br><br>
control the data reading section 41, based on the stored information of time information<br>
memory 48 of whether or not a specific screen playback mode is selected, controls the operation of MPEG audio signal processing section 45 and MPEG video signal processing section 46,  First micom 401 controls optical pickup 47 by controlling servo circuit 413 according to an operation command signal from the key input section 47 shown in FIG. 5, so that optical pickup 47 is moved to a desired sector position on optical disc 100. Second micom 402 receives control signals such as SCR, DTS, and PTS, and outputs a first and second control signal 4021 and 4022 based on the control signals to control the decoding operations of MPEG audio decoder 451 and MPEG video decoder 461. Second micom 402 has a storing buffer (not shown) for storing the time information of an I picture screen which is temporarily detected by I picture detection section 49.<br>
Hereinafter, the operation of a method for reproducing a selected screen in a V-CD reproducing system according to an embodiment of the present inventiori will be described in detail, with reference to FIGS. 9(A) and 9(B).<br>
An optical disk 100 is loaded on V-CD reproducing system 4 by a user, Then, the user pushes a playback key 47c of key input section 47 so that playback command signal 471 is inputted into a first micom 401 of a control section 40, Accordingly, since first micom 401 of control section 40 controls servo circuit 413 of a selected screen data reading section 41. an optical pickup 412 of data reading section 41 reads out data recorded in optical disk 100 in accordance with the MPEG algorithm, and outputs audio/video reading data 4121.<br>
Then, preamplifier 42 amplifies 414 audio/video reading data 4121 and outputs amplified signal 4141. Then, DPS 43 processes amplified signal 4141 in the form of a serial bit stream and outputs a serial bit streamed signal 4151. Then, CD-ROM decoder<br><br>
44 decodes serial bit streamed signal 4151 and seperates into control signals such as SCR, DTS, and PTS (step S1).<br>
Then, I picture detecting section 49 checks whether or not I picture screen data 491, which is the picture start code and the ! picture coding type data, is detected from MPEG video data 4411 of MPEG data 441 in step S2.<br>
According to the result of the check in step S2, in step S3, if I picture screen data 491 is detected, then first micom 402 temporarily stores the time information of I picture screen data 491 in a storing buffer (not shown), e.g, the minutes, the second, and the sector number in which start code is in.<br>
Then, in step S4, first micom 401 judges whether a moment screen memory key 47f is inputted. According to the result of the judgement in step S4, if a specific screen memory key 47f is not pushed, then second micom 402 judges whether or not a specific screen rriemory  mode is selected.<br>
According to the result of the judgement at step S4, it a specific screen me:nory mode is not selected, second micom 402 erases the temporarily stored time information m the storing buffer (not' shown) according to the control signal from first micom 401.<br>
On the other hand, if a specific screen memory mode is selected, that is, if the<br>
user pushes a specific memory key 47f in order to reproduce and watch a specific screen<br>
and the corresponding sound later while reproducing the V-CD, then first micom 401<br>
recognizes the inputted signal from specific memory key 47f and transmits it to second<br>
micom 402. Then, second micom 402 reads the time information of the I picmre screen<br>
which is temporarily stored sequentially in the storing buffer (not shown) and stores the<br>
pointed time information in time information memory 48 as a pointer [0], a pointer<br>
[1]	a pointer [Nl, and so on (step S5), as shown in FIG. 8.<br><br>
Then, in step S6, first micom 401 judges whether or not the data recorded on optical disc 100 are reproduced completely,<br>
According to the result of the judgment in step S6, if the data recorded in optical disc iOO are not reproduced completely, then control section 40 returns the V-CD reproducing system 4 to step S1 and repeats the operation after step S1, but if the data recorded in optical disc 100 are reproduced completely, in step S1 first micom 401 judges whether or not a specific screen reproducing mode is selected by checking whether or not a specific screen reproducing key 47h is pushed.<br>
According to the result of the judgment in step S7, if the specific screen reproducing mode is selected, in step S8, first micom 401 judges whether a last screen key 47g of key input section 47. is pushed,<br>
According to the result of the judgment in step S8, if the last screen key 47g is pushed, in step S9, second micom 402 reads the last time information data which have pointed to in time information memory 48, this is then transmitted these to first micom 401,<br>
Then, first micom 401 controls servo circuit 413 of data reading section 41 so that optical pickup 413 may be positioned in the selected sector based on the time information.<br>
Thus, optical pickup 413 is moved to the sector in which the last specific screen selected is positioned under the control of servo circuit 413 at step SIO, and the data in the sector are reproduced in step Sll. That is, I picture screen data, the following picwre screen (B or P picture), and the corresponding sound data are reproduced.<br>
At the same time, step 812, first micom 401 judges whether or not the reproducing time of the last specific screen selected has passed for the predetermined time, e.g. 10 seconds.<br><br>
According to the result of the judgement at step S12, if the predetermined time of 10 seconds has not passed, then control section 40 returns the V-CD reproducing system 4 to step Sll and repeats the operation after step Sll. But if 10 seconds has passed, then in step S13, secorid micom 402 reduces current pointer value by 1 and judges whether or not the next pointer information data are stored in time information memory 48.<br>
According to the result of the judgement at step S13, if the next pointer information data are not stored in time information memory 48, then the operation of reproducing the data is ended. But if the next pointer information data are stored in time information memory, then in step S14, first micom 401 moves optical pickup 412 to the sector position in which the I picture screen data of the next specific screen selected is located on the basis of the next pointer information data by controlling servo circuit 413. Then, control section 40 returns the V-CD reproducing system 4 to step Sll and repeats the operation after step Sll,<br>
In other words,  if a last selected screen key 47g is pushed, then an I picture scree<br>
of the last screen selected corresponding to a last pointer [1], pointer [2], 	and pointer<br>
[N] is displayed on a monitor (not shown) as shown in FIG. 8. Then, a following picture screen, e.g. B or P picture screen, is displayed and the corresponding sound is simultaneously outputted for a predetermined time. Subsequently, as the value of the pointer is mcreased, a next I picmre screen, a picture screen following the next I picture screen, and the corresponding sound are periodically outputted for the predetermined time.<br>
According to the result of the judgment in step S8, if the last screen key 47g is not pushed, then in step S9, second micom 402 reads the time information data which is first pointed to in time information memory 48, this is then transmitted to first micom 401.<br><br>
Accordingly, first micom 401 controls servo circuit 413 of selected screen data reading section 41 so that optical pickup 413 is positioned in the selected sector based on the time information,<br>
Accordingly, in step SIO, optical pickup 413 is moved to the sector in which the first selected specific screen is positioned under the control of servo circuit 413, then the data in the sector is reproduced in step Sll. That is, I picture screen data, the following picture screen (B or P picture), and the corresponding sound data are reprosuced.<br>
At the same time, in step S12, first micom 401 judges whether or not the reproducing time of the first selected specific screen has passed for the predetermined time, e.g. 10 seconds.<br>
According to the result of the judgment in step S12, if the predetennined time of 10 seconds has not passed, then control section 40 returns V-CD reproducing system 4 to step Sll and repeats the operation after step Sll, But if the 10 seconds has passed, then in step S13, second micom 402 increases the current pointer value by i and judges whether *ht next pointer infonnation data are stored in time information memory 48,<br>
According to the result of the judgement at step S13, if the next pointer information data are not stored in time information memory 48, then the operation of reproducing the data is ended. But if the next pointer information data are stored in time information memory, in step S14, first micom 401 moves optical pickup 412 to the sector position in which I picture screen data of the selected next specific screen are located on the basis of the next pointer information data by controlling servo circuit 413. Then, control section 40 returns the V-CD reproducing system 4 to step Sll and repeats the operation after step Sll.<br>
In other words, if a last selected screen key 47g is pushed, an I picmre screen of<br><br>
' the last selected screen corresponding to a last pointer [1], pointer [2],...pointer [N] is<br>
displayed on a monitor(not shown) as shown in FIG. 8. Then a following picture screen, e.g. B or P picture screen, is displayed and the corresponding sound is outputted for a predetermined time at the same time. Subsequently, as the value of the pointer is increased, a next I picture screen, a picture screen following the next I picture screen, and the corresponding sound are periodically outputted for the predetermined time.<br>
As described above, according to the present invention, since the control sectice selectively stores the specific screen data while reproducing an optical disc whereon the data are recorded by an MPEG method, if a specific screen playback mode is selected, among the screens and the corresponding sounds which have been reproduced after reproducing the optical disc has been completed, the selectively stored specific screens and the corresponding sound are outputted for a predetermined time periodically,  Thus, the user can reproduce a selected specific screen and the corresponding sound again. The present invention also has the additional advantage of editing a selected specific screen and the corresponding sound may be performed,<br>
It is understood that various other modifications will be apparent to and can be readily made by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of this invention. Accordingly, it is not intended that the scope of the claims appended thereto be limited to the description as set forth herein, but rather that the clamis be constructed as encompassing all the features of the patentable novelty that resides in the present invention, including all the features that would be treated as equivalents thereof by those skilled in the art of the subject which this invention pertains.<br><br><br>
