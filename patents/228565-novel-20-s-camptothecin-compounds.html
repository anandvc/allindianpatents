The present invention related to novel water soluble C-5-O-substituted analogues of 20(S)-Camptothecin having the general formula 1,<br><br>
or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, wherein R1 represents hydrogen or a group selected from hydroxy, (C1-C6) alkoxy, nitro, substituted amino, where the amino group is mono or disubstituted wherein the substituent is selected from (C1-C6) alkyl or substituted (C1-C6) alkyl, wherein the substituents are selected from hydroxy, (C1-C6) alkoxy, or {C1-Cg) alkyiamino;<br>
R represents hydrogen or (C1-C6) alkyl; and<br>
R represents substituted (C[-C6) alkyl, where substituent is selected from halogen, hydroxy, (C1-C6) alkoxy, or amino in which the amino group can be unsubstituted or mono, or disubstituted wherein the substituent is selected from hydroxy, or (C1-C8) alkyl when the amino group is disubstituted the substitutents are independent or combined together to form a cyclic ring having 6 ring atoms, the ring atoms are carbon atoms and nitrogen atoms.<br>
All the compounds of the formula I are prepared by reacting the compounds of the general formula 2,<br><br>
having 20 (S)-chiral carbon where R', R have the meaning given above, with the compounds of the formula R-OH where R' has the meanings given above.<br><br><br>
and was isolated from Camptotheca acnuminata by Wall and co-workers in 1966. However, its development as a potential drug for cancer treatment has been abandoned due to several unacceptable side effects on humans and as well as its low water solubility and high toxicity problems. Since the discovery of its mechanism of action as an inhibitor of topoisomerise I by Liu and co-workers in 1985 [L.FXiu, etal., J.BiolChem. 260, 14873 (1985)], the research interests on camptothecin has once again taken momentum.<br>
To overcome this problem of low water solubility and high toxicity of camptothecin, over the last 30 years, several research groups all over the world have prepared and investigated a number of camptothecin analogues involving the modification of rings A-E or the introduction of a variety of substituents on all the five rings of camptothecin of the formula 3[ M.E, wall eta!., y-A/ef/C/iem., 2£, 2689 (1993); R.P. Hertzberg etal., J. MedChem, 715 (1989); S.W.Sawada etal,, Chem.Pharm.BuU, 11(2), 310 (1993)]. Among the various camptothecin analogues prepared to date, only one of them namely, CPT-ll having the formula 4[ Chem.Pharm.Bnll,2 1446 (1991) ],<br><br>
was introduced as anti-cancer drug in Japan and Mexico and two more compounds namely, topotecan of the formula 5 [ JMedChem., H, 981(1991) ] and 9-aminocamptothecin of the formula 6 [ J.MedChem., 22, 2358 (1986) ],<br><br><br>
were currently undergoing extensive clinical trials. The extensively studied Structure activity relationship(SAR) on camptothecin of the formula 3[M.E.Wall etal., JMed.Chem.M, 2689 (1993)] has revealed that 20(S)-a-hydroxy-5-Iactone (E-ring) moiety in camptothecin is essential for its activity. However, according to recent reports by Ejima et.al., an amino group at C-20 position in 7-ethyI-10-melhoxycamptothecin of the formula 7[ A. Ejima etal., Chem. Pharm.Buli, 42(3), 683 (1992)].<br><br>
exhibited potent camptothecin like inhibititon of topoisomerase I activity. Both these reports are contrary to the assumption that 20(S)-a-hydroxy functionality in camptothecin is an essential feature for its anticancer activity. Based on the activity results obtained for the camptothecin analogues prepared so far in the literature, it was also established that ethyl substitution at C-7 position of camptothecin of the formula 3 plays an important role in the enhancement of anticancer activity by imparting stability to the E-ring lactone [T.G.Burke eta!., JMed.Chem 3Z 40 (1994)].<br><br>
Although the modification of substituents on rings A and B of camptothecin was taken up at a rapid pace to generate novel CPT analogues, ring 'C analogues of camptothecins were limited presumably because of the research work catried out by Sawada et al., which claimed that the substituents at C-5 position of camptothecin has resulted into the reduction of anti-tumor activity of camptothecins and produced inactive analogues [Sawada S.et.al., Chem. Pharm. Bull, 39(10), 2574(1991) ]. The C-5 substituted camptothecins claimed by Sawada et a!., ( JP 58,154,584 ; US 4, 513,138 ; US 4, 473,692 ; US 4,545,880 ; US 4, 339, 282 ) have the stmctural formula 10,<br><br>
where R represents hydroxy, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, acyloxy groups , R represents methoxy at 9th position, hydroxy, lower alkoxy, acyloxy, SH, thioalkyl, thioacyl, nitro, amino, alkylamino, acylamino and halogen at 10th position and R represents lower alkyl, lower aralkyl, CH2OH, COOH, COOMe, CH2OR' where R' represents lower alkyl or acyl group.<br>
The recent findings by K.H.Lee et al,,[ Bio.Org. MedChem.Lett.,(1), 77 (1995)] which includes the preparation of 5-hydroxymethyl camptothecin by the reaction of formaidehyde in N,N-dimethylformamide and 4-piperidinopiperidine on 20(S)-camptothecin, has revealed the reduced anti¬tumor activity of these compounds. Also, Danishefsky et al., prepared some of the C-5 substituted 20(RS)-camptothecin derivatives by a totally synthetic approach [ US 5,391,745 and US 5,446, 047].<br>
However, the synthetically prepared 5-substituted camptothecin derivative of the formula II [ Terasawa et.al., Heierocycles, 1S,81(1994)] claimed to have anti-tumor activity comparable to that of 20(S)-camptothecin.<br><br><br>
■ Keeping all these factors in mind, we focussed.our research studies on 20(S)-camptothecin aimed at the design of novel camptothecin analogues which can exhibit improved water solubility and improved stability of lactone form in solutioh. We identified an oxidative reaction in alcoholic solvents for this purpose. The resultant findings have culminated into the discovery of a novel synthetic transformation which can introduce a variety of alkoxy groups at C-5 position of 20(S)-camptothecins which upon acid hydrolysis produced C-5 hydroxy camptothecins of the formula 2,<br><br>
in which X represents NH, CH2 and sulfur which is the subject mattetiifr co-pending applications<br>
for Indian patent bearing the Nos<br>
respectively.	USIMPS:?-<br>
The process of preparaing thefcompounds of the formula I have been described and claimed in our<br>
co-pending application no.    _ ■_.	These applications have been divided out of the application<br>
no. 914/MAS/ 94 where the invention was originally described.<br>
Hence, the discovery led to a facile and versatile semi-synthetic methodology by which virtually every camptothecin derivative known in the literature can be transformed into a vatriety of C-5 substituted camptothecin aniogues. Therefore, the present invention provides a novel process for the preaparation of various C-5-O-substituted 20(S)-camptothecin derivatives of the formula 1<br><br>
starting from the compounds of the formula 2. Furthermore, the vast variety of substituents represented by OR- at the C-5 carbon of 20(S)-camptothccins of the general formula I made these compounds to possess water solubility ranging from O.OImg to 2mg per ml. All the compounds prepared by the present mvention exhibited significant in viiro anti-tumor activity against a wde range of human tumor cell lines.<br>

The results shown in Table 1 and 2 were obtained from conducting experiments at U. S. National Cancer Institute (NCI) . The proptocol followed for these experiments is given below :<br>
Each test compound was screened against a battery of 60 human cell lines obtained from eight organs. In a typical procedure, the cell suspensions that were diluted according to the particular ceU type and the expected target cell density (5000-40,000 cells per well based on cell growth characteristics) were added into 96-wen microliter plates. Inoculates were allowed a preincubation period of 24h at 37°C for stabilization.     Dilutions at twice the intended test<br><br>
concentrations were added at time zero in 100-).i] aliquots to microtiter plate wells. Usaually test compounds were evaluated at five 10-fold dilutions. The highest well concentration used in the test is 10 M. The cells are then incubated in the presence of drug (the test compound ) for further 48h in 5% CO2 atmosphere and 100% humidity. At the end of this time, the adherent cells are fixed to the plate by means of trichloroacetic acid, and after a number of washes, the cell layer is treated with the protein stain Sulforhodamine B. The optical density which is proportional to protein mass, is then read by automated spectrophotometric plate readers at a wavelength of 515 nm. Readings are transfered to a microcomputer and final reports are generated using especially developed software.<br>
