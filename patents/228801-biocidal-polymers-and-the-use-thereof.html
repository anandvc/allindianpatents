				<td>"BIOCIDAL POLYMERS AND THE USE THEREOF"<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the use of highly crosslinked, porous N-halamine<br>
biocidal polymers for inactivating pathogenic microorganisms and viruses in water and<br>
air filtration applications, thereby rendering the water and/or air safe for human<br>
consumption. The invention also relates to the use of these polymers for inactivating<br>
microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, and yeasts that can cause noxious odors and<br>
infections in commercial products, such as disposable diapers, infant swimwear,<br>
incontinence pads, bandages, sanitary napkins, pantiliners, sponges, mattress covers, shoe<br>
inserts, animal litter, carpets, fabrics, and air filters, thereby rendering the products free of<br>
noxious odors and pathogenic organisms under normal 	use conditions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
While a variety of biocidal polymers  [e.g.,  quaternary ammonium salts,<br>
phosphonium materials, halogenated sulfonamides, and biguanides (see Trends Polym.<br>
Sci. 4:364 (1996))] have been synthesized and tested for biocidal activity, a relatively<br>
new class of compounds known as N-halamines has been shown to have far superior<br>
properties including biocidal efficacy, long-term stability, and rechargeability once the<br>
efficacy has been lost.  One example of a biocidal N-halamine polymer is poly-1,3-<br>
dichloro-5-methyl-5-(4'-vinylphenyl)hydantoin, which is an inexpensive derivative of<br>
polystyrene, and which was first described m U.S. Patent No. 5,490,983, incorporated<br>
herein by reference in its entirety. Subsequent disclosures of its biocidal properties for<br>
use in disinfecting applications for water filters have recently occurred [see Ind. Eng.<br>
Chem. Res. 53:168 (1994); Water Res. Bull. 32:793 (1996); Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 54:4106<br>
(1995); J. Virolog. Meth. 66:263 (1997); Trends in Polym. Sci. 4:364 (1996); Water<br>
Cond. &amp; Pur. 39:96 (1997)].  The polymer is effective against a broad spectrum of<br>
pathogens including Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli,<br>
Candida albicans, Klebsiella terrigena, Legionella pneumophila, and rotavirus, among<br>
others. The polymer causes large log reductions in contact times on the order of a few<br>
seconds in water disinfectant applications. Furthermore, the polymer is effective at pH<br>
values at least in the range of about 4.5 to about 9.0 and at temperatures at least in the<br>
range of about 4°C to about 37°C, and is capable of action even in water containing<br>
heavy chlorine demand caused by bioburden.<br><br>
The biocidal hydantoin polymer is insoluble in water and organic compounds and<br>
will thus not migrate in liquid media. The polymer is stable for long periods of time in<br>
dry storage (a shelf life of at least one year at ambient temperature). The polymer can be<br>
produced on an industrial scale. Furthermore, all evidence obtained to date suggests that<br>
the polymer is non-toxic and non-sensitizing to humans and animals upon contact.<br>
A variety of microorganisms such as certain bacteria, fungi, and yeasts are<br>
capable of aiding the decomposition of bodily fluids, such as urine and blood, or in the<br>
formation of biofilms, that produce undesirable odors in otherwise useful commercial<br>
products. Bacteria such as Bacterium ammoniagenes and Proteus mirabilis are known to<br>
accentuate the decomposition of urea to form noxious ammonia gas through a urease<br>
enzyme catalysis mechanism (see for example U.S. Patent No. 5,992,351). The polymer<br>
poly-l,3-dichloro-5-methyl-5-(4'-vinylphenyl)hydantoin has been shown to be effective<br>
at inactivating Proteus mirabilis and thus minimizing the undesirable odor created by<br>
ammonia gas (U.S. Patent Application No. 09/685,963, incorporated herein by reference<br>
in its entirety). Also, the polymer is insoluble in bodily fluids so as not to migrate to skin<br>
surfaces, thus rendering it useful for disposable diapers, incontinence pads, bandages,<br>
sanitary napkins, and pantiliners.<br>
However, the preparation of poly-l,3-dichloro-5-methyl-5-(4'-<br>
vinylphenyl)hydantoin as uniform particles is tedious, requiring a three-step synthesis and<br>
the use of reagents such as potassium cyanide and carbon disulfide, as well as a high-<br>
pressure reactor in one of the steps. When fully chlorinated, the polymer binds about<br>
20% by weight chlorine, which causes a noticeable chlorine odor. Thus, new biocidal<br>
compounds are desired to be developed having fewer of these disadvantages.<br>
U.S. Patent Application No. 09/948,945 incorporated herein by reference in its<br>
entirety, describes biocidal beads of highly crosslinked (polystyrene! having pendant<br>
N-halamine groups. In this application, the aforementioned shortcomings in the prior art<br>
were addressed. However, other alternatives are desired. The present application fulfills<br>
the shortcomings of the prior art and provides further related advantages.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a polymer having repeating styrene units that have<br>
pendant halogenated and nonhalogenated N-halamine groups linked to the benzene ring<br>
of the styrene through a methylene group. The non-halogenated forms are referred to as<br>
N-halamine precursors.  In one aspect, the present invention relates to methylated<br><br>
polystyrene compounds having pendant N-halamine precursors and to the biocidal<br>
methylated polystyrene compounds having N-halamine groups and to the methods for<br>
their preparation.<br>
An N-halamine group is a heterocyclic, monocyclic 4 to 7 membered ring,<br>
wherein at least 3 members of the ring are carbon, from 1 to 3 members of the ring are<br>
nitrogen heteroatom, from 0 to 1 member of the ring is oxygen heteroatom, and wherein 0<br>
to 2 carbon members are carbonyl. At least one ring nitrogen has a chlorine or bromine<br>
atom bonded to it. A precursor N-halamine group is the heterocyclic group without any<br>
chlorine or bromine atoms on any ring nitrogens. A precursor N-halamine group has a<br>
hydrogen, or a hydroxy alkyl group bonded to all ring nitrogens that are not bonded to a<br>
linking group. In one embodiment the linking group is a methylene group. The<br>
methylene group bonds the N-halamine or N-halamine precursor group to the benzene<br>
ring of polystyrene. Representative of N-halamine and N-halamine precursor groups are<br>
the halogenated and nonhalogenated hydantoins, imidazolidinones, oxazolidinones, and<br>
isocyanurates.<br>
The polymeric compounds of the invention are preferably derived from<br>
methylated polystyrene particles. The particles can be used in absorbent articles that have<br>
an absorbent core with absorbent material. Methylated polystyrene refers to a<br>
polystyrene having a methylene group bonded to the benzene ring of the polystyrene.<br>
The methylene group is a linkage to the N-halamine or N-halamine precursor group. A<br>
representative methylated polystyrene is poly(p-methyl)styrene. A representative<br>
functionalized methylated polystyrene is poly(p-chloromethyl)styrene. In one<br>
embodiment of the invention, chloromethylated polystyrene crosslinked with<br>
divinylbenzene is used as a starting material for making the compounds of the invention.<br>
However, other crosslinking agents may be utilized. Anticipated uses for the biocidal<br>
compounds of this invention are for the disinfection of a variety of bacteria-carrying<br>
media, including, but not limited to, water, oil, and air. The compounds of the invention<br>
can be combined with absorbent materials and incorporated into absorbent products for<br>
the disinfection and the prevention of noxious odors caused by the decomposition of<br>
organic materials contained in bodily fluids.<br>
A further embodiment of the invention relates to the synthesis of methylated<br>
polystyrene having N-halamine precursor groups, and their biocidal derivatives.  N-<br><br>
halamine precursors are made biocidal when at least one ring nitrogen is bonded to a<br>
halogen. Preferably, the halogen is either a chlorine or bromine atom.<br>
In one embodiment to make the compounds of the invention, porous beads of<br>
highly crosslinked functionalized methylated polystyrene reactive toward N-halamine<br>
precursors is used as the starting material. The methylated polystyrene is functionalized<br>
by placing a halogen, such as a chlorine atom, on the methyl group, making the<br>
polystyrene reactive toward a N-halamine or a N-halamine precursor group.<br>
In one embodiment, the invention provides a polystyrene having a N-halamine<br>
precursor group bonded to at least some of the benzene rings of the polystyrene by a<br>
methylene group.<br>
In another embodiment, the invention provides a polystyrene having a biocidal N-<br>
halamine group bonded to at least some of the benzene rings of the polystyrene by a<br>
methylene group.<br>
In a further embodiment, the invention provides a method for making a<br>
methylated polystyrene having pendant N-halamine precursor groups. The method<br>
includes reacting a functionalized methylated polystyrene with an N-halamine precursor<br>
and an alkali metal base to produce a methylated polystyrene having pendant N-halamine<br>
precursor groups. In one embodiment, the appropriated functionalized methylated<br>
polystyrene is reacted with an N-halamine precursor and the base for from about 12 to<br>
about 96 hours at a temperature of from about 70° to about 120°C. To make the<br>
polystyrene biocidal requires halogenating the methylated polystyrene having pendant<br>
N-halamine precursor groups to produce the biocidal methylated polystyrene having<br>
pendant N-halamine groups.<br>
An alternate embodiment for making a methylated polystyrene having pendant<br>
N-halamine precursor groups includes reacting an N-halamine precursor with an alkali<br>
metal base to produce an alkali metal salt of the N-halamine precursor. In one<br>
embodiment, the N-halamine precursor is reacted with the alkali metal base for from<br>
about 15 minutes to about 2 hours at a temperature of from about 25° to about 100°C.<br>
The method includes reacting the alkali metal salt of the N-halamine precursor with a<br>
functionalized methylated polystyrene to produce a methylated polystyrene having<br>
pendant N-halamine precursor groups. In one embodiment, the appropriated<br>
functionalized methylated polystyrene is reacted with the N-halamine precursor salt for<br>
from about 4 to about 96 hours at a temperature of from about 70° to about 120°C. Either<br><br>
method of making a methylated polystyrene having pendant N-halamine precursor groups<br>
is used to make the biocidal derivative, and involves halogenating the methylated<br>
polystyrene having pendant N-halamine precursor groups to produce the biocidal<br>
methylated polystyrene having pendant N-halamine groups.<br>
One embodiment of the invention relates to the use of the biocidal polymeric<br>
compounds in filters for the disinfection of water and air.<br>
One embodiment of the invention relates to the disinfection and control of odor in<br>
bodily fluids in applications such as disposable diapers, infant swimwear, incontinence<br>
pads, bandages, sanitary napkins, pantiliners, and the like.<br>
Biocidal compounds made according to the present invention using<br>
chloromethylated polystyrene beads as a starting material require fewer steps to<br>
synthesize and produce less chlorine outgassing than the previously produced N-halamine<br>
polymer of U.S. Patent No. 5,490,983 to Worley et al., while maintaining a reasonable<br>
biocidal efficacy. Chloromethylated polystyrene beads have been utilized in the past to<br>
prepare ion-exchange resins and weakly biocidal polyquatemary ammonium salts (U.S.<br>
Patent No. 4,349,646 and U.S. Patent No. 4,826,924), but have not been functionalized<br>
with potent biocidal N-halamine moieties.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
The present invention may be understood more readily by reference to the<br>
following detailed description of specific embodiments and the examples included<br>
therein.<br>
One embodiment of the invention provides a polymer having a repeating unit,<br>
wherein the repeating unit has the structure:<br><br><br>
The moieties R of the repeating unit are selected from among the following<br>
N-halamine precursors when X is hydrogen, or N-halamines when X is chlorine or<br>
bromine:<br><br><br><br>
wherein R1, R2, R3, and R4 are independently selected from C1-C4 alkyl, phenyl,<br>
or aryl; X is hydrogen, chlorine, or bromine, at least one of which must be chlorine or<br>
bromine when the compound is a biocidal N-halamine, X is not chlorine or bromine for<br>
N-halamine precursors. "Independently selected" encompasses all the combinations of<br>
the one or more Rn groups possible with the moieties selected from C1-C4 alkyl, phenyl<br>
and aryl. Thus, the Rn groups can all be the same group or can all different groups or any<br>
other combination. The repeating unit appears consecutively if the polymeric compound<br>
is a homopolymer, or alternatively with one or more different repeating units if the<br>
polymeric compound is a copolymer.<br>
In one aspect of the invention, methylated polystyrene having pendant<br>
N-halamine precursor groups and biocidal methylated polystyrene having pendent<br>
N-halamine groups are provided, wherein the N-halamine and N-halamine precursor<br>
groups are either a halogenated or nonhalogenated hydantoin, imidazolidinone,<br>
oxazolidinone, or isocyanurate.<br>
In one embodiment, the invention provides a methylated polystyrene having<br>
pendant N-halamine precursor groups. The methylated polystyrene is derived from<br>
highly crosslinked chloromethylated polystyrene. The methylated polystyrene having<br>
pendant N-halamine groups is biocidal by virtue of the halogen bonded to a nitrogen of<br>
the heterocyclic moiety. The methylated polystyrenes of the invention are highly<br>
crosslinked and therefore are insoluble polymer beads. In one embodiment, the<br>
methylated polystyrene having pendant N-halamine groups is a biocidal polymer bead.<br>
The biocidal polymer beads can be employed in a filter for water, cutting oils, or<br>
air disinfection. The biocidal polymer beads can be mixed with an absorbent material.<br>
Suitable absorbent materials include the materials in disposable diapers, including natural<br>
and synthetic fibers. Among the natural fibers are cellulose fibers, most commonly<br>
derived from wood pulp. Synthetic fibers include polyolefins, among others. Polyolefins<br>
include polypropylene and polyethylene.  Superabsorbent polymers may be combined<br><br>
with the biocidal polymers of the present invention. In absorbent articles, the biocidal<br>
polymer of the invention can make up from about 0.1 to about 5.0 weight percent, more<br>
preferably a weight percent of about 1.0 for applications involving bodily fluids,<br>
including disposable diapers, infant swimwear, incontinence pads, bandages, sanitary<br>
napkins, pantiliners, mattress covers, shoe inserts, sponges, and animal litter. The weight<br>
percent is based on the combined weight of the polymer and any absorbent core<br>
components, such as wood pulp, any synthetic or natural fibers, cellulose fibers,<br>
polyolefin fibers, superabsorbent polymers, and the like. For air filters, coatings, or<br>
simple embedment of the biocidal polymer into available filter materials, a weight<br>
percent of from about 0.1 to about 2.0, more preferably a weight percent from about 0.5<br>
to about 1.0 is considered suitable. The weight percent is based on the combined weight<br>
of polymer and any filler materials.<br>
The biocidal polymer beads of the invention will inactivate pathogenic<br>
microorganisms and viruses contained in water or air media that comes in contact with<br>
the beads. In some applications, it is desirable to allow the media to flow through and<br>
contact the beads. The biocidal beads prevent or minimize noxious odors. It is believed<br>
the biocidal beads inactivate the microorganisms that enhance the decomposition of<br>
organic matter in bodily fluids to ammonia or other noxious materials. When biocidal,<br>
the beads will prevent or minimize noxious odors in air filters by inactivation of<br>
microorganisms including those that cause mildew and molds, as well as those from any<br>
liquid or aerosol which might contact the surface of the beads. The mechanism of action<br>
of the biocidal polymer is believed to be a result of surface contact of the microorganism<br>
with chlorine or bromine atoms covalently bound to the N-halamine groups of the<br>
polymer. The chlorine or bromine atoms are transferred to the cells of the<br>
microorganisms where they cause inactivation through a mechanism not completely<br>
understood, but probably involving oxidation of essential groups contained within the<br>
enzymes comprising the organisms.<br>
A wide variety of cartridge filtration devices can be used that incorporate the<br>
biocidal polymer beads, including very large units in small water treatment plants and in<br>
the air-handling systems of large aircraft, hotels, and convention centers, and small filters<br>
as might be employed in household carafes and for faucets and portable devices for<br>
backpacking and military field use. A broad variety of absorbent and filler materials can<br>
be used in combination with the biocidal polymer to aid in preventing noxious odors.<br><br>
Absorbent materials are able to hold fluids, aerosol particles, and solid contaminants for<br>
sufficient periods of time such that the biocidal polymer beads can make contact with the<br>
odor-causing microorganisms. Absorbent materials include, but are not limited to,<br>
swellable clays, zeolites, alumina, silica, cellulose, wood pulp, superabsorbent polymers<br>
and fibers, including polyolefin fibers, such as polypropylene fibers and polyethylene<br>
fibers. The absorbent material can contain further adjuvants such as deodorants,<br>
fragrances, pigments, dyes, and mixtures of these for cosmetic purposes. The biocidal<br>
polymer beads can be used within the absorbent cores of diapers, incontinence products,<br>
infant swimwear, pantiliners, sanitary napkins, and the like.<br>
A marked advantage of the biocidal polymer beads of this invention over prior<br>
odor-controlling technology is that the beads of the invention are much more effective<br>
biocides against pathogenic microorganisms, such as S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, than<br>
are the commercial biocides, such as the quaternary ammonium salts. The biocidal<br>
polymer beads can serve a dual function: inactivation of odor-causing microorganisms<br>
and inactivation of disease-causing pathogens. For this reason, the biocidal polymer<br>
beads will have widespread use in medical settings.<br>
It should be understood that the practice of this invention applies to odors<br>
generated by both human and animal fluids as well as to airborne and waterbome<br>
organisms.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides methods for making methylated<br>
polystyrene having pendant N-halamine precursor groups and methylated polystyrene<br>
having pendent N-halamine groups. As an initial matter, a methylated polystyrene is<br>
obtained that has been functionalized to react toward an N-halamine precursor or an N-<br>
halamine group. In one embodiment, the methylated polystyrene is functionalized by<br>
bonding a chlorine atom to the methylene group. One representative functionalized<br>
methylated polystyrene is poly(p-chloromethyl)styrene.	Crosslinked<br>
poly(chloromethyl)styrene is available from commercial vendors ranging up in size from<br>
very small microparticle sizes.<br>
Generally, chemical reactions proceed best when all reactants are dissolved in a<br>
solvent that ensures maximum contact of the reactants. It was unexpected that the<br>
heterogeneous reaction of the highly crosslinked chloromethylated polystyrene beads,<br>
which were insoluble in dimethylformamide (DMF), would proceed well in DMF when<br>
simply mixed with N-halamine precursor compounds. However, the reactions carried out<br><br>
in heterogeneous phases proved to provide adequate reaction of N-halamine precursors to<br>
the functionalized methylated polystyrene beads.  The biocidal polymer beads can be<br>
made in a variety of particle sizes dependent upon the particle size of the starting highly<br>
crosslinked chloromethylated polystyrene. Another advantage of the highly crosslinked<br>
chloromethylated  polystyrene  is  that  the  beads  are  porous  allowing  efficient<br>
heterogeneous reactions to be performed.  Nonporous beads could be used also with<br>
concomitant lower biocidal efficacy.  Ideally, for the applications described herein, the<br>
particle size of the biocidal polymer bead is preferably in the range of from about 100 to<br>
about 1500m, more preferably in the range of from about 200 to about 800 m.<br>
Particle  sizes  within  these  ranges  provide  adequate  flow  characteristics  for<br>
microbiologically contaminated fluids and lessen the risk of exposure of the respiratory<br>
systems of workers to fine aerosolized particles.  These two factors provide a marked<br>
improvement  over  the  powder  versions  of  poly-l,3-dichloro-5-methyl-5-(4'-<br>
vinylphenyl)hydantoin   or   poly-1,3-dibromo-5-methyl-5-(4'-vinylphenyl)hydantoin<br>
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,490,983 and use for odor control as described in U.S.<br>
Patent Application No. 09/685,963. Preferably, for the applications contemplated herein,<br>
the biocidal polymer beads should have pore sizes in the range of from about 10 to about<br>
100 nm, more preferably, in the range of from about 30 to about 70 nm.  The porous<br>
structure is advantageous in the synthetic reaction step because the highly crosslinked<br>
beads are insoluble in organic solvents and water.  The degree of crosslinking of the<br>
starting chloromethylated polystyrene should be in the range of from about 3 to about<br>
10 weight percent to ensure hardness and lack of solubility.  In one embodiment, the<br>
degree of crosslinking is from about 5 to about 8 weight percent. There are many types<br>
of highly crosslinked, porous chloromethylated polystyrene beads that can be used in the<br>
synthetic reaction step of this invention.  Providers of crosslinked chloromethylated<br>
polystyrene beads include the Suqing Group (Jiangyin, Jiangsu, PRC) and the Purolite<br>
Company (Philadelphia, PA).<br>
Representative methods of making a methylated polystyrene having pendant<br>
N-halamine precursors are as follows. In one embodiment, clean, highly crosslinked<br>
porous chloromethylated polystyrene beads are suspended in a medium, such as DMF.<br>
The chloromethylated polystyrene beads are reacted with an N-halamine precursor, such<br>
as 5,5-dimethylhydantoin, in the presence of an alkali metal carbonate, such as potassium<br>
carbonate, at a temperature from about 70° to about 120°C, preferably about 95 °C, for<br><br>
about 12 to about 96 hours to yield the methylated polystyrene having pendant<br>
N-halamine precursor groups. The time for this reaction is typically 72 hours when an<br>
alkali metal carbonate is employed.<br>
In an alternate embodiment, the alkali metal salt of the N-halamine precursor is<br>
prepared first by reacting an N-halamine precursor with an alkali metal base for from<br>
about 15 minutes to about two hours at a temperature of from about 25° to about 100°C.<br>
The alkali metal base is preferably a carbonate, a hydroxide, or a hydride, and includes an<br>
alkali metal chosen from sodium or potassium. The reaction time between the<br>
N-halamine precursor and chloromethylated polystyrene is reduced if the alkali metal salt<br>
of the N-halamine precursor is prepared first. The salt is then used in the subsequent<br>
reaction between the alkali metal salt of the N-halamine precursor with the<br>
chloromethylated polystyrene to yield the methylated polystyrene having pendant<br>
N-halamine precursor groups. The time and temperature for this subsequent reaction is<br>
from about 4 to about 96 hours at a temperature of from about 70° to about 120°C, but<br>
typically is about 12 hours or less. Thus, the overall preparation time can be reduced by<br>
employing the latter two-step reaction method.<br>
The isolated product beads made through either method are washed in boiling<br>
water for purification purposes. After having made the methylated polystyrene bead<br>
having pendant N-halamine precursor groups, an aqueous suspension of the bead is<br>
chlorinated or brominated to render the bead biocidal. Halogenation is accomplished by<br>
exposing the bead to a source of free chlorine (e.g., gaseous chlorine, sodium<br>
hypochlorite, calcium hypochlorite, sodium dichloroisocyanurate) or free bromine (e.g.,<br>
liquid bromine, sodium bromide/potassium peroxymonosulfate) in aqueous base. If<br>
chlorine gas is used, the reactor is preferably chilled to about 10°C to prevent undesirable<br>
side reactions. Ambient temperature can be employed for the other noted sources of free<br>
halogen, and the reactions can be carried out in a reactor or in situ in a cartridge filter<br>
packed with the unhalogenated precursor. Using these methods, typical loadings of about<br>
6-7% by weight chlorine and about 8-9% by weight bromine on the beads are generally<br>
obtained.<br>
The present invention is more particularly described in the following examples<br>
which are intended as illustrative only since numerous modifications and variations<br>
therein will be apparent to those skilled in the art.<br><br>
EXAMPLES<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
A Representative Preparation of Chlorinated Methylated Polystyrene Hydantoin Beads<br>
Porous beads of 5.6% crosslinked chloromethylated polystyrene (containing<br>
20.85% by weight chlorine) obtained from Suqing Group (Jiangyin, Jiangsu, PRC)<br>
having particle sizes in the range 180 to 425 m, but undetermined pore sizes, were<br>
cleaned by soaking them in acetone (400 mg/mL) for 30 minutes at 25°C and then by<br>
passing 3 portions of acetone (0.5 mL per g) through them in a filter funnel. Following<br>
drying to constant weight under vacuum at 50°C, 20.3 g (about 0.12 mole of active<br>
chlorine) of the beads were suspended in 150 mL of anhydrous DMF in a 250 mL flask<br>
fitted with a condenser. Then 16.5 g of anhydrous potassium carbonatg (0.12 mole) and<br>
15.4 g (0.12 mole) of 5,5-dimethylhydantoin were added, and the mixture was stirred for<br>
72 hours at 95°C. After cooling the mixture to 25°C, suction filtration was used to isolate<br>
the beads. The beads were then soaked in 500 mL of boiling water for 15 minutes and<br>
subsequently washed with three 100 mL portions of boiling water. Then the beads were<br>
dried under vacuum at 85°C to constant weight (27.2 grams or 34.0% add-on weight).<br>
An infrared spectrum of a small sample of the beads (crushed to a powder) in a KBr<br>
pellet exhibited prominent bands at 1715 and 1776 cm*1, which demonstrated the<br>
presence of the hydantoin functional group (the two expected carbonyl stretching bands).<br>
Then 10.0 g of the porous beads having hydantoin functional groups as described<br>
above were suspended in a flask containing 50 mL of 5.25% sodium hypochlorite and<br>
50 mL of water, and the pH was adjusted to 7.5 by the addition of 2 N acetic acid. The<br>
mixture was stirred for 45 minutes at 25°C, filtered, and washed with three 100 mL<br>
portions of water at 25°C. The thus chlorinated beads were dried under vacuum at 50°C<br>
until their weight became constant.  A sodium thiosulfate/iodometric titration indicated<br>
that the chlorine loading of the dried beads was 6.23% by weight. An infrared spectrum<br>
of a small sample of the beads (crushed to a powder) in a KBr pellet exhibited prominent<br>
bands at 1726 and 1790 cm-1 as expected for a monochlorinated hydantoin functional<br>
group.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
An Alternative Representative Preparation of<br>
Chlorinated Methylated Polystyrene Hvdantoin Beads<br>
The potassium salt of 5,5-dimethylhydantoin was prepared by reacting 25.6 grams<br>
(0.2 mole) of 5,5-dimethylhydantoin with 11.2 grams (0.2 mole) of potassium hydroxide<br>
in 100 mL of boiling ethanol with stirring. The ethanol and product water were removed<br>
under vacuum to obtain the white salt. The salt was added to 200 mL of anhydrous DMF<br>
and heated to 95°C until all of the salt dissolved. Then 8.12 grams (about 0.048 mole of<br>
active chlorine) cleaned chloromethylated polystyrene beads were added and the mixture<br>
was heated with stirring at about 100°C for 12 hours. The unreacted potassium salt of the<br>
hydantoin and the DMF were recycled for further use, and the beads functionalized with<br>
hydantoin groups were washed and dried under vacuum at 85°C until constant weight as<br>
in Example 1. The weight of the beads prepared in this manner was 11.0 grams (35.5%<br>
by weight add-on). Chlorination of the beads as in Example 1 produced a chlorine<br>
loading of 6.3% by weight. This alternate method of preparing the chlorinated beads<br>
would appear to be superior to that in Example 1 as the reaction time for functionalization<br>
with the hydantoin moiety is reduced considerably (from 72 to 12 hours).<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Representative Preparation of Brominated Methylated Polystyrene Hydantoin Beads<br>
Methylated polystyrene hydantoin beads (5.0 grams) prepared as described in<br>
Example 1 were suspended in a solution containing 40 mL of 10% sodium hypobromite<br>
and 40 mL of water. The pH was adjusted to 7.0 using 2 N acetic acid. The mixture was<br>
stirred for 1 hour at 25°C. The brominated beads were removed by filtration, washed<br>
with three 100 mL portions of water, and dried under vacuum until constant weight was<br>
obtained. The bromine content determined by sodium thiosulfate/iodometric titration was<br>
8.2% by weight. An infrared spectrum of a small sample of the beads (crushed to a<br>
powder) in a KBr pellet exhibited prominent bands at 1714 and 1776 cm*1 consistent with<br>
the presence of a monobrominated hydantoin functional group.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Representative Preparation of Chlorinated Methylated<br>
Polystyrene Hvdroxvmethvlhydantoin Beads<br>
Porous beads of 5.6% crosslinked chloromethylated polystyrene (containing<br>
20.85% by weight chlorine) obtained from Suqing Group (Jiangyin, Jiangsu, PRC)<br><br>
having particle sizes in the range 180 to 425 m, but undetermined pore sizes, were<br>
cleaned as described in Example 1. Following drying to constant weight under vacuum at<br>
50°C, 10.57 g (about 0.062 mole of active chlorine) of the beads were suspended in<br>
150 mL of anhydrous DMF in a 250 mL flask fitted with a condenser. Then 10.7 g of<br>
anhydrous potassium carbonate (0.078 mole) and 12.3 g (0.078 mole) of 1-<br>
hydroxymethyl-5,5-dimethylhydantoin were added, and the mixture was stirred for<br>
48 hours at 100°C. After cooling the mixture to 25°C, suction filtration was used to<br>
isolate the beads functionalized with hydantoin groups. The beads were then washed<br>
with three 100 mL portions of water, soaked in 250 mL of boiling water for 15 minutes,<br>
and subsequently washed with two 100 mL portions of water. Then the beads were dried<br>
under vacuum at 85°C to constant weight (13.98 grams or 32.3% add-on weight). An<br>
infrared spectrum of a small sample of the beads (crushed to a powder) in a KBr pellet<br>
exhibited prominent bands at 1715 and 1777 cm-1 which demonstrated the presence of<br>
the hydantoin functional group (the two expected carbonyl stretching bands).<br>
Then 5.0 g of the porous beads functionalized with hydantoin groups as described<br>
above were suspended in a flask containing 40 mL of 5.25% sodium hypochlorite and<br>
40 mL of water, and the pH was adjusted to 7.5 by the addition of 2 N acetic acid. The<br>
mixture was stirred for 1 hour at 25°C, filtered, and washed with three 100mL portions<br>
of water at 25°C. The thus chlorinated beads were dried under vacuum at 50°C until their<br>
weight became constant. A sodium thiosulfate/iodometric titration indicated that the<br>
chlorine loading of the dried beads was 6.83% by weight. An infrared spectrum of a<br>
small sample of the beads (crushed to a powder) in a KBr pellet exhibited prominent<br>
bands at 1728 and 1792 cm-1 as expected for a monochlorinated hyroxymethylhydantoin<br>
functional group.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
Representative Preparation of Chlorinated Methylated Polystyrene Imidazolidinone<br>
Beads<br>
To a 250 mL flask were added 2.84 g (0.02 mole) of 2,2,5,5-<br>
tetramethylimidazolidin-4-one (TMIO) prepared as described in Tsao, etal., Biotech.<br>
Prog. 7:60 (1991); 0.49 g (0.02 mole) of sodium hydride; and 100 mL of anhydrous<br>
DMF. After stirring the mixture for 2 hours at 25°C, 6.0 g (0.035 mole of active<br>
chlorine) of chloromethylated polystyrene beads were added. The mixture was stirred at<br>
95°C for 48 hours, cooled, filtered, and the beads functionalized with imidazolidinone<br><br>
groups were washed with two 100 mL portions of water and then held in boiling water for<br>
15 minutes. After filtration, the beads were again washed with two 100 mL portions of<br>
water and then dried under vacuum at 75°C until constant weight (6.65 g) was obtained.<br>
The percent by weight add-on was 10.8%. This add-on percentage was lower than for the<br>
other beads described in previous examples. An infrared spectrum of a small sample of<br>
the beads (crushed to a powder) in a KBr pellet exhibited prominent bands at 1613 and<br>
1696 cm"1 which demonstrated the presence of the imidazolidinone functional group<br>
most probably bonded to the polymer beads at the amide nitrogen of the heterocyclic<br>
moiety.<br>
Then 3.4 g of the beads functionalized with imidazolidinone groups were soaked<br>
in 20 mL of 5.25% sodium hypochlorite and 20 mL water at a pH of 7.5 (adjusted by<br>
addition of 4 N acetic acid) at 25°C for 1 hour. After filtration and washing with three<br>
100 mL portions of water, the beads were dried to constant weight under vacuum at 50°C.<br>
A sodium thiosulfate/iodometric titration indicated that the chlorine loading of the dried<br>
beads was 2.85% by weight. An infrared spectrum of a small sample of the beads<br>
(crushed to a powder) in a KBr pellet exhibited prominent bands at 1609 and 1717 cnr1<br>
indicative of a rather low chlorine loading.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
Stability of Chlorinated Methylated Polystyrene Hvdantoin Beads<br>
Chlorinated methylated polystyrene hydantoin beads prepared as described in<br>
Example 1 (5.0 g) were dried under vacuum at about 50°C until constant weight was<br>
obtained. These beads were stored in a capped brown bottle. Periodically over 90 days<br>
samples were removed for analytical determination of chlorine content using a sodium<br>
thiosulfate/iodometric titration procedure. The data are shown in Table 1.<br><br><br>
It can be concluded that the chlorine stability of the beads is quite good and that<br>
the beads remain biocidal for more than 96 days.<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
Biocidal Efficacy Testing of Representative Biocidal Polymer Beads<br>
The beads as prepared in Examples 1-4 were tested for biocidal activity against<br>
two pathogens contained in water. In the tests, about 3.3-3.4 g of biocidal halogenated<br>
beads were packed into glass columns having inside diameter 1.3 cm to a length of about<br>
7.6 cm; the empty bed volumes of the beads ranged from 2.9 to 4.4 mL. Identical sample<br>
columns of unhalogenated beads were prepared to be used as controls. After washing the<br>
columns with demand-free water until less than 0.2 mg/L of free chlorine or 0.5 mg/L of<br>
free bromine could be detected in the effluent, an aqueous solution of 50 mL of pH 7.0<br>
phosphate-buffered, demand-free water containing 3.6-5.5 x 106 CFU (colony forming<br>
units)/mL of the Gram positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6538) or<br>
4.9-6.8 x 106 CFU (colony forming units)/mL of the Gram negative bacterium 0157:H7<br>
Escherichia coli (ATCC 43895) was pumped through the column at a measured flow rate<br>
of about 2.9 to 4.4 mL/second, so as to achieve a contact time of about 1 second in the<br>
column per pass.  A 25 L aliquot of the effluent was quenched with 0.02 N sodium<br>
thiosulfate before plating, and the remainder of the 50 mL inoculum was immediately<br>
recycled through the column.  This process was repeated 4 more times, i.e., 6 passes<br>
through the column.  The contact times necessary to achieve complete inactivation<br>
(6.6-6.8 logs/mL) of the two bacteria were 1-2 seconds for the chlorinated methylated<br>
polystyrene hydantoin beads and less than or equal to 1 second for the brominated<br>
methylated polystyrene hydantoin beads and the chlorinated methylated polystyrene<br>
hydroxymethylhydantoin  beads. For  the  chlorinated  methylated  polystyrene<br>
imidazolidinone beads, longer contact times (2-3 seconds for a 6.6 log/mL reduction of<br><br>
S. aureus and about 6 seconds for about a 4.0 log/mL reduction of E. coli) were required.<br>
The control columns containing unhalogenated beads gave no reduction of either<br>
bacterium in a contact time of greater than 60 seconds when the same concentrations of<br>
the inoculums were employed, indicating that the bacteria in the halogenated columns<br>
were inactivated, rather than just removed by filtration.<br>
The results in this example indicate that the beads prepared as described in<br>
Examples 1-5 possess considerable efficacy against bacterial pathogens in aqueous<br>
solution and are excellent materials for use in the disinfection of water, in particular for<br>
recirculated water.<br>
EXAMPLE 8<br>
Odor Control<br>
Beads prepared as described in Example 1 containing chlorine loadings of about<br>
6.2% by weight were evaluated as to their efficacies in controlling ammonia generation<br>
through inactivation of Proteus mirabilis.<br>
Blends of 5-10 mg of chlorinated beads and 1.0 g of wood pulp (0.5 or 1.0% by<br>
weight beads) were prepared by mixing with 200 mL of distilled water in a blender<br>
(Hamilton Beach 7 Blend Master Model 57100, whip setting). Following vacuum<br>
filtration, which produced wood-pulp pads, and drying in air at 25°C, the samples were<br>
placed in Petri dishes.<br>
An inoculum known to provide a high level of odor was formulated. The<br>
formulation included 9 mL of a mixture of 25 mL of pooled human female urine and<br>
1.25 g of urea and 1 mL of an aqueous suspension of about 1.3 x 108 CFU/mL of Proteus<br>
mirabilis.<br>
Each sample, including a control of wood pulp with nonhalogenated polymer, was<br>
inoculated with 1 mL of the formulation described above, and the Petri dishes were<br>
sealed with parafilm and incubated at 37°C for 24 hours. The samples were then<br>
measured for ammonia production using Drager tubes (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA,<br>
and Lab Safety Supply, Janesville, WI) capable of detection in the range 0.25 to 30 mg/L.<br>
The control sample registered an ammonia concentration greater than 30 mg/L in a<br>
contact time interval of 2 to 4 hours, while the chlorinated samples (0.5 and 1.0%<br>
bead/wood pulp mixtures) registered ammonia concentrations of only 1.5 to 2.0 mg/L<br>
after 4 hours contact and only about 2.0 mg/L after 24 hours contact.<br><br>
It can be concluded that the porous chlorinated beads are highly effective at<br>
preventing ammonia generation and hence noxious odor even at very low blends with an<br>
absorbent material like wood pulp.<br>
While the preferred embodiment of the invention has been illustrated and<br>
described, it will be appreciated that various changes can be made therein without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br>
