The fact that the active compounds are well tolerated by plants at the concentrations required for controlling plant diseases permits the treatment of aerial parts of plants, of propagation stock and seeds, and of the soil.<br>
The active compounds are employed particularly successfully for controlling cereal diseases, such as, for example, against Erysiphe, Fusarium, Pseudocercosporella and Puccinia species, or for controlling diseases in viticulture or fruit and vegetable production, such as, for example, against Venturia, Sphaerotheca, Phyto-phthora and Plasmopara species, or else for controlling rice diseases, such as, for example, Pyricularia species. Furthermore, the active compounds according to the invention have a very powerful and broad in-vitro activity.<br>
Depending on their particular physical and/or chemical properties, the active compounds can be converted into the customary formulations, such as solutions, emulsions, suspensions, powders, foams, pastes, granules, aerosols, microencapsulations in polymeric substances and in coating compositions for seed, or else ULV cold- and hot-fogging formulations.<br>
These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixing the active compounds with extenders, that is, liquid solvents, liquefied gases under pressure, and/or solid carriers, optionally with the use of surface-active agents, that is, emulsifiers and/or dispersants, and/or foam formers. In the case of the use of water as an extender, organic solvents can, for example, also be used as auxiliary solvents. The following are mainly suitable as liquid solvents: aromatics such as xylene, toluene or alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated aromatics or chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons such as chlorobenzenes, chloroethylenes or methylene chloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane or paraffins, for example mineral oil fractions, alcohols such as butanol or glycol and their ethers and esters, ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents such as dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulphoxide, or else water. Liquefied gaseous extenders or carriers are to be understood as meaning liquids which are gaseous at ambient temperature and under atmospheric pressure, for example aerosol propellants such as halogenohydrocarbons, or else butane,  propane,  nitrogen and  carbon dioxide.   Suitable  solid  carriers  are:   for<br><br>
example ground natural minerals such as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous earth, and ground synthetic minerals such as highly-disperse silica, alumina and silicates. Suitable solid carriers for granules are: for example crushed and fractionated natural rocks such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite and dolomite, or else synthetic granules of inorganic and organic meals, and granules of organic material such as sawdust, coconut shells, maize cobs and tobacco stalks. Suitable emulsifiers and/or foam formers are: for example nonionic and anionic emulsifiers such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, for example alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, alkylsulphonates, alkyl sulphates, arylsulphonates, or else protein hydrolysates. Suitable dispersants are: for example lignin-sulphite waste liquors and methylcellulose.<br>
Adhesives such as carboxymethylcellulose and natural and synthetic polymers in the form of powders, granules or latices, such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl acetate, or else natural phospholipids such as cephalins and lecithins and synthetic phospholipids can be used in the formulations. Other additives can be mineral and vegetable oils.<br>
It is possible to use colorants such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide, titanium oxide and Prussian blue, and organic dyestuffs such as alizarin dyestuffs, azo dyestuffs and metal phthalocyanine dyestuffs, and trace nutrients such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum and zinc.<br>
The formulations generally comprise between 0.1 and 95 per cent by weight of active compound, preferably between 0.5 and 90 %.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention, as such or in their formulations can also be used as a mixture with known fungicides, bactericides, acaricides, nematicides or insecticides, for example to widen the spectrum of action or to prevent the build-up of resistance. In many cases, synergistic effects are obtained, i.e. the activity of the mixture is greater than the activity of the individual components.<br>

The salts are removed by filtration, the filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure, the residue is taken up in 600 ml of ethyl acetate, and the organic phase is washed in succession with 50 ml of saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution and with 50 ml of semi-saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution.

Preparation of a precursor of Formula (XHD<br>
Example (XIII-1)<br>
A mixture of 60^ *	in 2.3 I of suiphoiane is dried by<br>
distilling off 500 ml of liquid at 145°C and 20 mbar. 1054 g of 5-chloro-4,6-di-fluoropyrimidine (DE-A 3843558) and 25 g of tetraphenylphosphonium bromide are subsequently added, 5 bar of nitrogen is injected and the mixture is stirred for 24 hours at 240°C, during which process the pressure rises to 11 bar. The reaction mixture is cooled to 80°C and the pressure is released. The mixture is now reheated slowly under atmospheric pressure, during which process the product distils off. When the bottom temperature has reached 200°C, the pressure is reduced to 150 mbar to accelerate the distillation and to obtain further product. In total, 664 g (70.7 % of theory) of 4,5,6-trifluoropyrimidine of boiling point 86 to 87°C are obtained.<br>
