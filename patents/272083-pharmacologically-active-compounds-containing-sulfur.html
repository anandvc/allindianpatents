				<td>PHARMACOLOGICALLY ACTIVE COMPOUNDS CONTAINING SULFUR<br>
Field of Invention<br>
This invention relates to pharmacologically active compounds containing sulfur which can<br>
be transformed to pharmacologically active di-sulfide compounds, and to methods for<br>
preparing the same in vitro or formulating to allow for in vivo formation of the di-sulfide<br>
compounds. The compounds according to this invention are preferably formed between a<br>
pharmaceutically active compound containing a thiol (sulfhydryl), sulfinyl, sulfonyl or<br>
sulfonamide group and a pharmacologically acceptable thiol compound.<br>
Background<br>
Sulfur in organic compounds plays a varied and critical role in biological systems. The<br>
simple sulfur containing amino acid cysteine is a significant protein building block. It<br>
participates in complex metal binding roles, binding to other sulfur groups, protein folding<br>
bonding and reduction-oxidation (REDOX) functions. Sulfur atoms are also an important<br>
part of amino acid building blocks of peptides, proteins, enzymes, membranes, nucleic<br>
acids and DNA.<br>
Many pharmaceutically active compounds (PACs) contain a thiol (sulfhydryl), sulfinyl<br>
(SO), sulfonyl (SO2) or sulfonamide (SONR'R' where R' is hydrogen or alkyl) group<br>
which undergoes oxidation-reduction (REDOX) reactions with thiol (sulfhydryl),<br>
disulfide, sulfinyl or sulfonyl groups attached to proteins, enzymes (eg gastric<br>
H,K,ATPase), peptides (e.g. glutathione) or simple molecules (eg cysteine). The binding<br>
of the PAC to these groups is a reversible process influenced by a number of factors,<br>
including pH, presence of other oxidising and reducing groups, physiological REDOX<br>
buffer systems, REDOX catalysts, enzymes, and temperature.<br>
In most physiological systems there is a need to maintain a healthy dynamic REDOX<br>
balance both inside and outside cells.<br>
The sulfur group of PACs may be particularly important to drug activity. The range of<br>
activities of PACs containing sulfur groups cover anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory, anti-<br><br>
rheumatic, anti-ulcer, anti-viral, anti-psychotic, mucolytic, hepatoprotectant, diuretic,<br>
fungicidal, diabetic activities amongst others. The extent of sulfur group content in PACs<br>
indicates the biological/pharmacological significance of sulfur content in drug molecules.<br>
Examples of pharmaceutically active compounds (PACs) containing sulfinyl, sulfonyl or<br>
sulfonamide groups include proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and compounds having anti-<br>
ulcerant activity, such as Omeprazole, Omeprazole isomers such as S-Omeprazole,<br>
Esomeprazole (NexiumÂ®), R-Omeprazole, Lansoprazole, Pantoprazole, Rabeprazole,<br>
Pariprazole, Tenatoprazole, Leminoprazole and their isomers or metabolites.<br>
However, despite their biological activity and pharmaceutical benefit, PACs containing<br>
sulfur groups are typically relatively unstable, can present formulation difficulties, and/or<br>
be of low bioavailability.<br>
Sulfur containing PACs may also be unstable in the acid environment of the stomach.<br>
Examples include the proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) such as Omeprazole. Elaborate and<br>
costly formulations have been developed and continue to be developed in attempts to<br>
address these problems (see for example WO 94/25070, WO 00/27366 and AU 13541/00).<br>
Thus, there is a need for a PPI formulation that does not involve an enteric coat but is still<br>
stable under stomach acidic conditions.<br>

hi accordance with the present invention, compounds of the formula I are formed by a<br>
reaction between a PAC containing a sulfhydryl, sulfinyl, sulfonyl or sulfonamide group<br>
with a pharmacologically acceptable sulfhydryl compound either in vitro or in vivo. The<br>
reaction in vitro can occur in an aqueous solution, in a polar protic solvent such as<br>
methanol, ethanol, butanol or a mixture of water and polar protic solvent without the<br>
addition of an acid. In one embodiment, the reaction in vitro is carried out in an aqueous<br>
solution at a molar ratio of PAC to pharmacologically acceptable sulfhydryl compound of<br>
at least 1:2 to 1:10. Compounds of the formula I can also be prepared in vivo by mixing a<br>
PAC containing a sulfhydryl, sulfinyl, sulfonyl or sulfonamide group with a<br>
pharmacologically acceptable sulfhydryl compound at a molar ratio of PAC to<br>
pharmacologically acceptable sulfhydryl compound of at least 1:2 to 1:10 and optionally<br><br>
one ore more auxiliaries or excipients without the addition of an acid. In one embodiment<br>
the PAC is in a dry powder form that is blended with a sulfhydryl compound that is also in<br>
dry powder form. Administration of the mixture or dry powder blend to a subject allows<br>
for the in vivo formation of the compounds of formula I.<br>
The resulting compounds of the formula I are water soluble, and may be concentrated by<br>
standard techniques such as chromatography (including high performance liquid<br>
chromatography (HPLC) or column chromatography), diafiltration, or evaporation.<br>
Alternatively, compounds of the formula I may be recrystallised from solution according<br>
to standard techniques.<br>
Examples of PACs which may be used in accordance with the invention are proton pump<br>
inhibitors (PPIs) of the general formula B shown below:<br><br>
wherein<br><br><br>
As shown above, the sulfur group of the PPIs may be in the sulfinyl form and is linked<br>
through two covalent bonds to the rest of the PAC structure.<br>
The structure and synthesis of PPIs are disclosed in the following patents, which are<br>
incorporated herewith by reference: Omeprazole is disclosed in US Patent 4,255,431 and<br>
EP0005129, Pantoprazole is disclosed in US Patent 4,758,579 and EP 166287,<br>
Lanzoprazole is disclosed in US Patent 4,628,098 and EP 174726, Leminoprazole is<br>
disclosed in GB 2163737, Tenatoprazole is disclosed in EP254588 and Rabeprazole is<br>
disclosed in US Patent 5,045,552.<br>
These PPIs are all substituted benzimidazoles and have the same mechanism of action.<br>
They are distinctive in that under acidic conditions, protonation of the pyridine and<br>
benzimidazole nitrogens results in formation of a tetracycline sulfenamide with a terminal<br>
thiol group, which is the active form of the drug binding to exposed cysteine residues on<br>
the hydrogen-potassium ATPase enzyme system at the surface of the gastric parietal cells<br>
to form covalent disulfide bonds that inhibit the activity of the pump.<br>
The structure and synthesis of other PACs are described in the literature as indicated<br>
above, and will be known to those skilled in the art.<br>
In particular embodiments of the invention the PACs employed are Omeprazole,<br>
Omeprazole isomers such as S-Omeprazole, Esomeprazole (NexiumÂ®), R-Omeprazole,<br><br>
Lansoprazole, Pantoprazole, Rabeprazole, Pariprazole, Leminoprazole, Tenatoprazole and<br>
their isomers, pharmaceutically acceptable salts or metabolites.<br>
In particular embodiments of the invention compounds of the formula (I) having a<br>
structure (V):<br><br>
wherein:<br>
RA, RB and Rc independently represent hydrogen, C1-6 alkyl, C1-6 alkoxy, C3-6 cycloalkyl,<br>
C3-6 cycloalkoxy, C1-6 fluoroalkyl or C1-6 fluoroalkoxy; and RD represents hydrogen, C1-6<br>
alkyl, C1-6 alkoxy, C1-6 fluoroalkyl or C1-6 fluoroalkoxy or halogen.<br>
Compounds of formula (V) include those shown in Table 1 below.<br><br><br>
Contrary to all of the current PPI formulations where the acid labile PPI is protected from<br>
exposure to acidic conditions usually by an enteric or oil coating, as disclosed herein the<br>
present invention allows the stabilisation of the PPI by conversion to a disulfide complex<br>
either in vitro or in vivo.<br>
The present invention also provides stable, ready-to-use oral or injectable administrable<br>
acid stable PPI compositions in solid or liquid form suitable for direct administration as<br>
liquid, gels, pastes, powders, tablets or for filling into capsules for human or animal use.<br>
The compositions can optionally also comprise one or more auxiliaries or excipients.<br>
The present invention also provides compositions comprising one or more compounds of<br>
the formula I as defined above for example the invention provides dry powder, tablet or<br>
injectable formulations for the in vivo production of compounds of formula I as defined<br>
above that have one or more proton pump inhibitors as described above and one or more<br>
sulfhydryl compounds as described above.<br>
The PPIs used in accordance with the invention have increased protection from acid<br>
inactivation in the stomach and are efficiently absorbed directly into the stomach region.<br>
Compositions of the invention are of high potency and bioavailability.<br>
PPIs contemplated herein for use in accordance with the present invention include<br>
Omeprazole, Omeprazole isomers such as S-Omeprazole, Esomeprazole (NexiumÂ®), R-<br>
Omeprazole, Lansoprazole, Pantoprazole, Rabeprazole, Pariprazole, Tantoprazole,<br>
Leminoprazole, together with their isomers, pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof as<br>
well as their metabolic prodrug forms. However, those skilled in the art will appreciate<br>
that the invention is not so limited, but that any pharmaceutically acceptable PPI may be<br>
employed. The disulfide compound that results from the reaction of the PPI and the<br>
sulfhydryl compound is stable under stomach acidic conditions and when formulated into<br>
a solid dosage form, the formulation does not need to be enterically coated.<br>
US 6,093,743 refers to creation of a "prodrug of proton pump inhibitors" by producing a<br>
hydrolysable sulfinyl or arylsulfonyl group attached to the benzimidazole nitrogen or<br><br>
includes a group that forms a Mannich base with the benzimidazole nitrogen. Applicant<br>
believes such a compound remains unstable to acid conditions.<br>
PPIs are also themselves classed as pro-drugs which after administration are altered to a<br>
tetracycline sulfenamide with a terminal thiol group, which is the active form of the drug<br>
binding to the cysteine residue(s) in the H+/K+ ATPase gastric proton pump in the<br>
secretory membrane of the parietal cell to form covalent disulfide bonds that inhibit the<br>
activity of the pump.<br>
This binding process was originally thought to be irreversible but is now known to be<br>
reversed by glutathione and other endogenous reducing agents in parietal cells. This<br>
invention utilizes the ability of PPIs to reversibly bind with these types of reducing agents<br>
which has led to the development stabilising proton pump inhibitors with increased<br>
bioavailability.<br>
The present invention is applicable to any pharmaceutically acceptable compound (PAC)<br>
which contains a sulfhydryl, sulfinyl, sulfonyl or sulfonamide group which forms a<br>
covalent bond with the sulfhydral group of a pharmacologically acceptable thiol<br>
compound. The resulting compounds or complexes are stable in the acid conditions of the<br>
stomach, and on tissue absorption undergo disulfide interchange with relevant enzymes or<br>
proteins in the body.<br>
To describe the transport mechanisms of PACs as di-sulfides which can rapidly exchange<br>
with other biological sulfhydryl and di-sulfide groups in the body, the present inventor has<br>
coined the term "Zipper Effect". While not wishing to be bound to any one theory, the<br>
inventor believes that this mechanism also temporarily opens up pathways by dynamic<br>
reversible disengagement of protein disulfide bonds. This Zipper Effect results in<br>
improved chemical transport and increased micro circulation or diffusion particularly of<br>
beneficial bio-chemicals. Other simple sulfur compounds such as N-acetyl-cysteine also<br>
typically disrupt protein disulfide bonds and is used as a mucolytic to thin out mucous<br>
fluid. Another example is the role of the simple plasma sulfur compounds glutathione and<br><br>
glutathione disulfide which are in a state of dynamic equilibria acting as a plasma<br>
reduction-oxidation buffer system.<br>
The compounds of the present invention allow for optimization of suitable PAC/disulfide<br>
compound pairing. The dynamic REDOX reversible nature of a disulfide bond formation<br>
and the Zipper Effect mentioned above is believed to significantly facilitate<br>
bioavailability. The PAC and sulfhydryl content of compounds of the present invention<br>
provides improved therapeutic benefit as a consequence of reversible disulfide bond<br>
formation.<br>
As disclosed herein the compounds of the present invention can be formed either in vitro<br>
as part of the formulation or in vivo by incorporating the unreacted PAC and thiol<br>
compound in the formulation.<br>
Typically under aqueous conditions, a PAC as herein before described can react with a<br>
thiol compound as hereinbefore described, at a molar ratio between 1:2 to 1:10, optionally<br>
at a temperature between 5 to 40Â°C. The resulting compounds may be water soluble.<br>
The di-sulfide compounds of the present invention or the PAC and thiol compound can be<br>
incorporated into typical pharmaceutical compositions such as liquids, emulsions,<br>
suppositories, solutions, plasters (for example TTS), gels, pastes, powders, tablets,<br>
granules, pellets, capsules, injectable, as well as confectionary and foodstuffs. The<br>
compounds and compositions according to the invention can be administered by any<br>
suitable route, such as orally, parenterally, intraveneously or percutaneously. The suitable<br>
route for administration will vary from case to case as will be appreciated by those skilled<br>
in the art.<br>
Compositions of the invention may include additional ingredients commonly used in the<br>
formulation of human and veterinary medicines with the exception of substances which<br>
cause or contribute to catalytic oxidation reactions in the preparations such as metal based<br>
pigments or dyestuffs. For example, fragrances and flavouring agents such as caramel,<br>
carrot, apple, cinnamon, vanilla and the like; colouring agents such as approved F&amp;C<br><br>
dyestuffs, natural colouring such as beta carotene and natural vegetable oil colouring<br>
components. (It should be noted that no metal based pigments or dyestuffs should be used<br>
which might contribute to catalytic oxidation reactions in the preparations). Natural<br>
sweeteners such as sugar, molasses solids, artificial sweeteners such as saccharins,<br>
cyclamates; REDOX buffers such as ascorbates, pH buffers, preservatives such as<br>
parabens; antioxidants such as BHT, BHA; viscosity and rheology agents such as natural<br>

oil, maize oil, sesame oils such as peanut oil, saffiower oil, olive oil, cottonseed oil, maize<br>
oil, sesame oil, arachis oil or coconut oil; silicone oils, including polysiloxanes, such as<br>
methyl polysiloxane, phenyl polysiloxane and methylphenyl polysolpoxane; volatile<br>
silicones; mineral oils such as liquid paraffin, soft paraffin or squalane; cellulose<br>
derivatives such as methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, sodium<br>
carboxymethylcellulose or hydroxypropylmethylcellulose; lower alkanols, for example<br>

palmitate, isopropyl myristate or ethyl oleate; polyvinylpyrridone; agar; carrageenan; gum<br>
tragacanth or gum acacia, and petroleum jelly. Typically, the carrier or carriers will form<br>
from 1% to 99.9% by weight of the compositions.<br>
Formulations suitable for oral administration may be presented in discrete units, such as<br>
capsules, sachets, lozenges, or tablets, each containing a predetermined amount of the<br>
active compound; as a powder or granules; as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or<br>
non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsion. Such formulations may<br>
be prepared by any suitable method of pharmacy which includes the step of bringing into<br>
association the active compound and a suitable carrier (which may contain one or more<br>
accessory ingredients as noted above). In general, the formulations of the invention are<br>
prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active compound with a liquid or<br>
finely divided solid carrier, or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the resulting mixture<br><br>
such as to form a unit dosage. For example, a tablet may be prepared by compressing or<br>
moulding a powder or granules containing the active compound, optionally with one or<br>
more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing, in a<br>
suitable machine, the compound of the free-flowing, such as a powder or granules<br>
 optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, and/or surface active/dispersing<br>
agent(s). Moulded tablets may be made by moulding, in a suitable machine, the powdered<br>
compound moistened with an inert liquid binder.<br>
Liquid forms for oral administration may contain, in addition to the above agents, a liquid<br>
 carrier. Suitable liquid carriers include water, oils such as olive oil, peanut oil, sesame oil,<br>
sunflower oil, safflower oil, arachis oil, coconut oil, liquid paraffin, ethylene glycol,<br>
propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, glycerol, fatty<br>
alcohols, triglycerides or mixtures thereof.<br>
 Formulations suitable for buccal (sublingual) administration include lozenges comprising<br>
the active compound in a flavoured base, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; and<br>
pastilles comprising the compound in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerin or sucrose<br>
and acacia.<br>
 Compositions of the present invention suitable for parenteral administration typically<br>
conveniently comprise sterile aqueous preparations of the active compounds, which<br>
preparations may be isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient. These preparations<br>
are typically administered intravenously, although administration may also be effected by<br>
means of subcutaneous, intramuscular, or intradermal injection. Such preparations may<br>
i conveniently be prepared by admixing the compound with water or a glycine buffer and<br>
rendering the resulting solution sterile and isotonic with the blood. Injectable<br>
formulations according to the invention generally contain from 0.1% to 60% w/v of active<br>
compound(s) and are administered at a rate of 0.1 ml/minute/kg or as appropriate.<br>
Parenteral administration is a preferred route of administration for the compounds of the<br>
 present invention.<br><br>
Formulations suitable for rectal administration are typically presented as unit dose<br>
suppositories. These may be prepared by admixing the active compound with one or more<br>
conventional solid carriers, for example, cocoa butter, and then shaping the resulting<br>
mixture.<br>
Compositions of the invention may also comprise one or more additional<br>
pharmacologically active ingredients. Examples include: tranquilizers (for example from<br>
the group of the benzodiazepines, e.g. diazepam), spasmolytic drugs (e.g. bletamiverine or<br>
camylofine), anticholinergic drugs (e.g. oxyphencyclimine or phencarbamide), local<br>
anesthetics (e.g. tetracaine or procaine), optionally also enzymes, vitamins or amino acids.<br>
For example, the compounds of formula I can be used in combination with other<br>
pharmaceutical compounds which buffer or neutralize gastric acid or which inhibit the<br>
secretion of acid, such as, for example, antacids (such as, magaldrate), H2-receptor<br>
blockers (for example cimetidine, ranitidine), P-CAB inhibitors or gastrin antagonists.<br>
Such additional compounds may enhance the main action of the compound of formula I in<br>
an additive or superadditive sense, eliminate or reduce side-effects, and/or obtain a more<br>
rapid onset of action. Combination with NSAIDs (such as, for example, aspirin,<br>
etofenamate, diclofenac, indomethacin, ibuprofen or piroxicam) for preventing the<br>
gastrointestinal damage caused by the NSAIDs, or with antibacterial substances (such as,<br>
for example, cephalosporins, tetracyclins, penicillins, macrolides, nitroimidazoles or else<br>
bismuth salt) for controlling Helicobacter pylori is also possible. Antibacterial<br>
combination partners for compounds of the invention include, for example, meziocillin,<br>
ampicillin, amoxicillin, cefalothin, cefoxitin, cefotaxim, imipenem, gentamycin, amicacin,<br>
erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, clarithromycin, azithromycin and<br>
combinations	thereof	(e.g.	clarithromycin+metronidazole	and<br>
amoxicillin+clarithromycin).<br>
Throughout this specification and the claims which follow, unless the context requires<br>
otherwise, the word "comprise", and variations such as "comprises" or "comprising", will<br>
be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or step or group of integers or<br>
steps but not the exclusion of any other integer or step or group of integers or steps.<br><br>
The reference in this specification to any prior publication (or information derived from<br>
it), or to any matter which is known, is not, and should not be taken as an<br>
acknowledgment or admission or any form of suggestion that that prior publication (or<br>
information derived from it) or known matter forms part of the common general<br>
knowledge in the field of endeavour to which this specification relates.<br>
Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the invention described herein is susceptible to<br>
variations and modifications other than those specifically described. It is to be understood<br>
that the invention includes all such variations and modifications. The invention also<br>
includes all of the steps, features, compositions and compounds referred to or indicated in<br>
this specification individually or collectively, and any and all combinations of any two or<br>
more of said steps or features.<br>
The present invention will now be described with reference to the following non-limiting<br>
examples.<br>
Example 1<br>
Proton pump inhibitor with a -S=O sulfinyl (oxidising) group can react with the<br>
sulfhydryl (reducing) group of, for example, N-acetyl cysteine according to the following<br>
chemical equation:<br>
PAC-S-O + SH-C PAC-S-S-C<br>
where PAC-S=O is a PPI and SH-C is a N-acetyl cysteine molecule or a cysteine residue<br>
group on an amino acid, peptide or protein. The PAC-S-S-C disulfide covalent bonded<br>
product is more stable than the original PPI in the presence of acids. PPIs are normally<br>
acid labile resulting in PPI metabolites which are either less active or inactive.<br>
These compounds are in a state of dynamic equilibria with formation and disengagement<br>
of disulfide covalent bonds.<br><br>
The covalent bonded PPI is capable of transferring from one coordination site to another.<br>
Thus a proportion of the bound PPI in the complex will be transferred to other cellular<br>
sites, plasma etc with a proportion reaching the parietal cell membrane where it binds to<br>
the cell proton pump cysteine residues forming a disulfide bond.<br>
Example 2<br>
Disulfide interchange can be illustrated by the following chemical equation:<br>
PAC-S-S-C + G-S-S-G ââPAC-S-S-G + C-S-S-G<br>
where G-S-S-G is a typical glutathione di-sulfide product which can under go dynamic<br>
interchange with the PAC-S-S-C disulfide covalent bonded product.<br>
The PAC may be derived from any compound with a residual sulfinyl group such as a PPI.<br>
Example 3<br>
Preparation of Omeprazole- N-Acetyl Cysteine Disulfide Complex in vitro<br>
The mole ratio of Omeprazole to N-Acetyl Cysteine should typically be a minimum 1:2<br>
but more typically 1:2.5 or higher.<br>
140 g of N-acetyl cysteine and 100g of Omeprazole was added to 260 g of water at 20Â°C<br>
and stirred over one hour until a clear solution was obtained. The reaction was slightly<br>
exothermic. Such reactions can typically rise in temperature to about 40Â°C. Larger batch<br>
sizes may require cooling to maintain the batch temperature below 40Â°C. The<br>
Omeprazole-N-acetyl cysteine disulfide solution was stored below 10Â°C.<br>
Samples of the disulfide solution of Example 3 when analysed by HPLC showed the<br>
disulfide compound as an earlier peak with a shorter retention time than Omeprazole. The<br>
parameters used in the HPLC analysis were as follows:<br>
Instrumental Parameters:	<br>

accordance with Example 3<br><br>
Other proton pump inhibitors or PACs referred to herein can be made in a similar fashion.<br>
The disulfide compounds in these examples may be recrystallised, or recovered by HPLC,<br>
or other established techniques, and then formulated into tablets, powders, pastes,<br>
capsules, injectable or other dosage forms.<br>
Example 4<br>
Human or Veterinary Powder Formulation for in vivo formation of Omeprazole-N-Acetyl<br>
Cysteine Disulfide Complex<br>
The mole ratio of Omeprazole or Omeprazole salts to N-acetyl cysteine should typically<br>
be a minimum 1:2 but more typically 1:2.5 or higher.<br>
The following powdered ingredients were mixed together in the proportions shown:<br><br><br>
As can be seen from Table 3, the typical retention time for N-acetyl cysteine is<br>
approximately 1.40 minutes. The typical retention time for Omeprazole is approximately<br>
6.59 minutes. The typical retention time for the Omeprazole-N-acetyl cysteine disulfide is<br>
approximately 1.56 minutes as can be seen in Table 2 of Example 3.<br>
The dry powder blend can be added directly to food or just prior to use can be mixed with<br>
water to make a stable suspension for oral or nasal tube administration to humans or<br>
animals.<br>
Example 5<br>
Preparation of Omeprazole plus N-Acetyl Cysteine Human Application Tablets for in vivo<br>
formation of Disulfide Complex<br>
The following ingredients were mixed together in the proportions shown:<br>
All ingredients were preferably minus 200 mesh (particle size)<br>
Omeprazole	20 mg<br>
N-Acetyl Cysteine	40 mg<br>
Light Magnesium Oxide	100 mg<br>
Croscarmellose sodium	7.0 mg<br>
Magnesium stearate	3.0 mg<br>
and auxiliaries/excipients up to	350 mg.<br>
The mixture was compressed into tablets having a weight of 350 mg per tablet, so that<br>
each tablet contained 20 mg of Omeprazole which was the label claim. The tablet<br>
required no enteric coating.<br>
The conversion of the Omeprazole to the acid stable Omeprazole-N-Acetyl Cysteine<br>
disulfide compound took place in vivo and the formulations required no enteric coating.<br><br>
Other proton pump inhibitors or PACs referred to herein can be formulated in a similar<br>
fashion and then formulated into powders, tablets, capsules, pastes, pellets, granule,<br>
injectable or other dosage forms.<br>
Example 6<br>
Preparation of Omeprazole plus N-Acetyl Cysteine Human Injectable<br>
The following ingredients were mixed together in the proportions to give a clear solution.<br>
Omeprazole	20 mg<br>
N-Acetyl Cysteine	70 mg<br>
Water for Injection	5 ml<br>
Stored at 0-5 degrees Celsius in amber vials.<br>
Example 7<br>
Preparation of Omeprazole - N-Acetyl Cysteine Horse Paste<br>
Mixed lOOgrams of OmeprazoleâN Acetyl Cysteine disulfide solution as prepared in<br>
Example 3 with 2 grams of xanthan gum to make a paste.<br>
Biological Examples<br>
Samples prepared in Examples 4, 6 and 7 were tested on horses.<br>
The protocol adopted was to administer the samples to the horses with their evening food<br>
then withdraw access to water for the following 20 hours. During the 15 to 19 hour period<br>
small samples of stomach fluid were withdrawn for pH measurement.<br>
Control samples were run based on a commercial Omeprazole oil based product and an<br>
enteric coated product. All were dosed at the equivalent of 4 mg of Omeprazole per kg of<br>
horse body weight.<br><br><br><br>
As the tests on the above samples show, the acid suppression activity of the Omeprazole -<br>
N-Acetyl Cysteine disulfide either as the in vivo type powder formulation of Example 4,<br>
the in vitro injectable of Example 6 or the in vitro formulation of Example 7 compared<br>
well with the commercially available oil and enteric coated type products.<br><br>
