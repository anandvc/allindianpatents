				<td>GLASS FIBER FILLED THERMOPLASTIC COMPOSITIONS<br>
WITH GOOD SURFACE APPEARANCE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to glass-reinforced thermoplastic molding<br>
compositions and more particularly to compositions containing grafted<br>
acrylate rubber and polyamide.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A glass fiber reinforced thermoplastic molding composition suitable<br>
for the preparation of articles having good surface properties is disclosed.<br>
The composition contains a resinous blend and a filler component. The<br>
resinous blend contains<br>
(i) 20 to 50 wt.% of a grafted acrylate rubber (ii) 2 to 10 wt.% of a first<br>
copolymer containing structural units derived from styrene,<br>
(meth)acrylonitrile and maleic anhydride<br>
(iii) 20 to 80 wt.% polyamide, and (iv) 0 to 40 wt.% of a second copolymer<br>
containing structural units derived from styrene and (meth)acrylonitrile. The<br>
filler component of the inventive composition contains (a) 1 to 29 percent of<br>
milled glass fibers and (b) 1 to 29 percent of chopped glass fibers, the<br>
percent being relative to the weight of the molding composition. The<br>
inventive composition may optionally further contain a positive amount of a<br>
wollastonite. Molded articles that are prepared of the composition feature<br>
good mechanical properties and excellent surface quality.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Thermoplastic molding compositions that contain grafted acrylate<br>
rubber are known. Also known are such compositions that are reinforced<br>
with glass fibers. The challenge of obtaining such reinforced compositions<br>
that are suitable for making molded articles of exceptionally good surface<br>
qualities has not yet been met.<br>
The objective of the work leading to the present invention therefore<br>
has been to develop a thermoplastic molding composition that combines<br>
the good properties of grafted acrylate rubber with the reinforcing effect of<br>
glass fibers without sacrificing the surface quality of the molded article.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The thermoplastic molding composition of the present invention<br>
contains a resinous blend and a filler component. The resinous blend<br>
contains<br>
(i) 20 to 50, preferably 25 to 45 percent of a grafted acrylate rubber<br>
(herein referred to as ASA),<br>
(ii) 2 to 10, preferably 4 to 8 percent of a first copolymer having a<br>
weight average molecular weight of 60,000 to 180,000, preferably 100,000<br>
to 140,000 g/mole and containing structural units derived from styrene<br>
(including substituted styrene wherein substituents are halogens or alkyl<br>
groups, as well as alpha methyl styrene), (meth)acrylonitrile and maleic<br>
anhydride, and<br>
(iii) 20 to 80, preferably 25 to 60 percent of polyamide.<br>
(iv) 0 to 40, preferably 5 to 25 percent by weight of a second<br>
copolymer having a weight average molecular weight of 70,000 to 200,000,<br>
preferably 105,000 to 155,000 g/mole, the structure of which contains units<br>
derived solely from styrene and (meth)acrylonitrile.<br>
The filler component of the inventive composition contains<br>
(a) 1 to 29 percent of milled glass fibers having an average length of<br>
about 1/64" to 1/16", and<br>
(b)1 to 29 percent of chopped glass fibers,<br>
the percents, all occurrences, being relative to the weight of the molding<br>
composition.<br>
Optionally, the inventive composition may further contain a positive<br>
amount of up to 29 percent by weight, preferably up to 10 percent (relative<br>
to the weight of the molding composition) of wollastonite, in the form of<br>
particles having an average length of 20 to 300, preferably 30 to 250<br>
microns and particle diameter of 2 to 20, preferably 3 to 12 microns.<br>
The ASA Resin<br>
Component (a), the ASA resin (acrylate-styrene-acrylonitrile<br>
interpolymer), is known as an impact-modified, substantially thermoplastic<br>
resin which comprises a SAN matrix in which is dispersed an acrylate<br>
elastomer phase as impact modifier. Advantageous ASA resins which are<br>
commercially available comprise a crosslinked (meth)acrylate elastomer, a<br>
crosslinked SAN copolymer and a substantially linear SAN copolymer.<br>
Methylated styrenes such as a-methyL styrene or vinyl toluene may be<br>
used in place of all or part of the styrene.<br>
The ASA resins may be prepared by a variety of known methods<br>
involving emulsion or bulk polymerization. The preferred ASA resins are of<br>
core-shell structure; these structures are well known in the art and have<br>
been disclosed in, among others U.S. Patent 3,944,631 that is<br>
incorporated herein by reference. The (meth)acrylate elastomer core<br>
portion of these resins may be composed of alkyl, aryl, or arylalkyl esters of<br>
acrylic or methacrylic acids. These may be prepared by a two-step process<br>
in which the (meth)acrylate elastomer core (which may by at least partially<br>
crosslinked, such as by the known incorporation of polyfunctional vinyl<br>
compounds) is covered with a thermoplastic shell of polymethyl<br>
methacrylate, polystyrene, styrene-acrylonitrile copolymer, or similar vinyl<br>
(co)polymers.<br>
Other ASA resins which may be advantageously used in the<br>
composition of the invention are the types disclosed in U.S. Patents<br>
3,655,824; 3,830,878; 3,991,009; 4,433,102; 4,442,263; and 4,409,363, all<br>
of which are incorporated herein by reference. These ASA resins are<br>
thermoplastic resins that are typically made of an acrylate ester, styrene (or<br>
a-methylstyrene), and acrylonitrile. These resins exhibit good impact, heat<br>
distortion and weathering characteristics.<br>
The ASA component of the inventive composition is present in an<br>
amount of 20 to 50, preferably 25 to 45 percent by weight relative to the<br>
weight of the resinous blend.<br>
The First Copolymer<br>
The first copolymer, having weight average molecular weight of<br>
60,000 to 180,000, preferably 100,000 to 140,000 g/mole, contains<br>
structural units derived from styrene (including substituted (a-<br>
methyl)styrene wherein substituents are halogens or alkyl groups),<br>
(meth)acrylonitrile and maleic anhydride.<br>
Structurally, the first copolymer contains 50 to 90, preferably 60 to<br>
80 wt. percent of units derived from styrene, 10 to 50, preferably 20 to 40<br>
wt. percent of units derived from (meth)acrylonitrile and 0.2 to 30,<br>
preferably 0.5 to 5 wt. percent of units derived from maleic anhydride, the<br>
wt. percents being relative to the weight of the first copolymer. The<br>
preparation of the first copolymer is conventional.<br>
The first copolymer is present in the inventive composition in an<br>
amount of 2 to 10, preferably 4 to 8 percent by weight relative to the<br>
weight of the resinous blend.<br>
The Polvamide Resin<br>
The poiyamide resins used in the blends of this invention are well<br>
known in the art and embrace semi-crystalline and amorphous resins<br>
having a molecular weight of at least 5000 and commonly referred to as<br>
nylons. Suitable polyamides include those described in U.S. Patents<br>
2,071,250; 2,071,251; 2,130,523; 2,130,948; 2,241,322; 2,312,966;<br>
2,512,606; 3,393,210; 2,071,250; 2,071,251; 2,130,523; 2,130,948;<br>
2,241,322; 2,312,966; and 2,512,606; all incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The poiyamide resin may be produced by condensation of equimolar<br>
amounts of a saturated dicarboxylic acid containing from 4 to 12 carbon<br>
atoms with a diamine, in which the diamine contains from 4 to 14 carbon<br>
atoms. Excess diamine can be employed to provide an excess of amine<br>
end groups over carboxyl end groups in the poiyamide. Examples of<br>
polyamides include polyhexamethylene adipamide (66 nylon),<br>
polyhexamethylene azelaamide (69 nylon), polyhexamethylene<br>
sebacamide (610 nylon), and polyhexamethylene dodecanoamide (612<br>
nylon), the polyamide produced by ring opening of lactams, i.e.,<br>
polycaprolactam, polylauric lactam, poly-11-amino-undecanoic acid,<br>
bis(paraaminocyclohexyl) methane dodecanoamide. It is also possible to<br>
use in this invention polyamides prepared by the copolymerization of two of<br>
the above polymers or terpolymerization of the above polymers on their<br>
components, e.g., an adipic, isophthalic acid hexamethylene diamine<br>
copolymer. Preferably, the polyamides are linear with a melting point in<br>
excess of 200 degrees C. The term "nylon" as used herein refers to nylon<br>
containing conventional compounding ingredients as are known to those<br>
skilled in the art. Examples of the polyamide resin are Nylon 4, Nylon 6,<br>
Nylon 7, Nylon 8, Nylon 9, Nylon 11, Nylon 12, Nylon 66, Nylon 610, etc.<br>
These polyamide resins may be used alone or in combination.<br>
The polyamide component of the inventive composition is present in<br>
an amount of 20 to 80, preferably 25 to 60 percent relative to the weight of<br>
the resinous blend.<br>
The Second Copolymer<br>
The second copolymer, having weight average molecular weight of<br>
70,000 to 200,000, preferably 105,000 to 155,000 g/mole, the structure of<br>
which contains units derived solely from styrene and (meth)acrylonitrile<br>
wherein the structural units derived from styrene amount to about 55 to 85<br>
% and the units derived from acrylonitrile amount to 15 to 45%, the<br>
percents being relative to the weight of the second copolymer. The<br>
preparation of the second copolymer is conventional.<br>
The second copolymer is present in the inventive composition in an<br>
amount of 0 to 40, preferably 5 to 25 percent by weight relative to the<br>
weight of the resinous blend.<br>
The Filler Component<br>
The filler component of the inventive composition contains 1 to 29<br>
percent of milled glass fibers having an average length of about 1/64" to<br>
1/16" and 1 to 29 percent of chopped glass fibers, the percent being<br>
relative to the weight of the molding composition. In an additional<br>
embodiment of the invention the filler component further contains<br>
wollastonite. The wollastonite is in the form of particles having an average<br>
length of 20 to 300, preferably 30 to 250 microns and particle diameter of 2<br>
to 20, preferably 3 to 12 microns.<br>
(a) Milled Glass Fibers<br>
Milled glass fibers have been widely used as a filler for polymeric<br>
systems, see, for instance, U.S. Patents 4,381,352,4,680,214, and<br>
4,861,803. The standard milled glass fiber used in the industry has a<br>
diameter of about 16 micrometers and average length of about 1/64" to<br>
1/16". More information relative to the milled glass fibers has been<br>
disclosed in S. H. Metzger, Jr. and K. Seel, "High Modulus RIM<br>
Elastomers for Automotive Exterior Body Panels" in J. Cell. Plastics, 268-<br>
273 (1981) and in U.S. Patent 4,381,352, both incorporated herein by<br>
reference. The length of a glass fiber can be expressed in various ways,<br>
such as average fiber length or as bulk density. For example, the average<br>
length of a "1/16-inch" milled glass fiber is about 0.006 inches (0.253 mm)<br>
and the bulk density of such a fiber is about 0.500 g/cm3. It has now been<br>
found that milled glass fiber, having a diameter of 10 to 20 micrometers<br>
provides unexpected advantages when used as a filler for the inventive<br>
composition.<br>
The inventive composition contains 1 to 29, preferably 3 to 25<br>
percent of milled glass fibers the percent being relative to the weight of the<br>
molding composition.<br>
(b) Chopped Glass Fibers<br>
Chopped glass fibers have been widely used as a filler for polymeric<br>
systems. The standard cut length of the chopped glass fibers used in the<br>
invention is 1 to 20 mm, preferably 2 to 10 mm. The nominal diameter of<br>
the chopped glass fibers used is 2 to 50 micrometers, preferably 5 to 20<br>
micrometers.<br>
The inventive composition contains 1 to 29, preferably 3 to 25<br>
percent of chopped glass fibers the percent being relative to the weight of<br>
the molding composition.<br>
The Optional Component<br>
Characterized in terms of the physical dimensions of its particles,<br>
the median diameter (D50) of the optional wollastonite component in the<br>
context of the present invention is about 2 to 20, preferably 3 to 12, most<br>
preferably 5 to 10 microns and its length is about 20 to 300, preferably 30<br>
to 250, most preferably 100 to 200 microns. The median diameter of the<br>
wollastonite, is determined as equivalent spherical diameter by Sedigraph<br>
(X-ray). The length (volume-weighted mean) is determined microscopically<br>
by image analysis. The amount of the optional wollastonite in the inventive<br>
composition is a positive amount of up to 29 percent, preferably up to 10<br>
percent (the percents being relative to the weight of the molding<br>
composition).<br>
Other additives known in the art for their art recognized function may<br>
also be included in the inventive composition in functional amounts. These<br>
include flame retarding agents, mold release agents, lubricants and<br>
stabilizers, including thermal, hydrolytic and UV stabilizers as well as dyes<br>
and pigments.<br>
The inventive composition offers distinct advantages over<br>
corresponding compositions that contain chopped glass fibers. The surface<br>
properties of the instant compositions are surprisingly and unexpectedly<br>
improved there over.<br>
The preparation of the inventive composition is conventional and<br>
may be carried out by following procedures and using equipment that are<br>
well known to the art-skilled.<br>
The invention will be better understood with reference to the<br>
following examples, which are presented for purposes of illustration rather<br>
than for limitation, and which set forth the best mode contemplated for<br>
carrying out the invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The properties of the exemplified compositions were determined as noted<br>
below:<br>
Flexural properties: determined at room temperature using an<br>
Instron universal machine with cross-head speed of 0.05 in/minute in<br>
accordance with ASTM D-790. The test specimens measured 6.35 cm x<br>
1.27 cm x 3.18 cm.<br>
Tensile properties: determined at room temperature using an<br>
Instron universal machine with cross-head speed of 5 mm/minute in<br>
accordance with ASTM D-638. Type I tensile bars were used as test<br>
specimens.<br>
Impact Strength (Izod @ 1/8" and 1/4" thickness) at room<br>
temperature (RT) was determined in accordance with ASTM D256. The<br>
test specimens measured 6.35 cm x 1.27 cm x indicated thickness.<br>
Vicat - is the softening temperature (1 Kg), °C determined according to ASTM<br>
D1525. The temperature of the oil increased at a rate of 2°C/minute.<br>
DTUL- is the deflection temperature under load (264 psi (1.8 MPa)),<br>
°C, determined according to ASTM D648. The temperature of the oil<br>
increased at a rate of 2°C/minute.<br>
The quality of the surface of molded articles was evaluated visually<br>
and ranked from "good" (1) to "poor" (5)-The base line for the ranking is<br>
that of an unfilled-ASA the ranking of which is 1. The ranking considered<br>
the presence/absence of smudges, and streaks and locals of non-uniform<br>
color. The inclusion of black pigment in the compositions aided the<br>
evaluations because surface defects are more noticeable in molding thus<br>
pigmented.<br>
The parts of Molding-1 were made with the tool with the dimension<br>
of 4" x 6"x 0.1", with the fan gate thickness of 0.1". The dimensions of the<br>
tool used in making the parts of Molding-2 were 3.5" x 2.25" x 0.158". The<br>
tool was side gated with the gate size of 0.1".<br>
Compositions in accordance with the invention and comparative<br>
examples were prepared and their properties determined; a summary of<br>
the testing is presented in the following tables. In addition to the<br>
components indicated below, each of the compositions also contained<br>
identical amounts of an antioxidant, light absorber, light stabilizer and<br>
pigment, which have no criticality in the present context.<br>
The compounding of the compositions and the molding of test<br>
specimens were carried out following the procedures summarized below:<br>
The compositions that were tested were identical in terms of the<br>
compositional makeup of their resinous components and additives.<br>
The resinous component of each of the compositions contained<br>
35.0 wt. % of ASA rubber.<br>
6.0 wt. % of a copolymer of styrene, acrylonitrile, and maleic<br>
anhydride (the relative amounts of these components were 66.5 /32.5/1%;<br>
the weight-average molecular weight of the copolymer was 115,000<br>
g/mole).<br>
44 wt. % of a polyamide 6 having relative viscosity of 48 (measured<br>
as a solution in formic acid) determined in accordance with ASTM D789.<br>
15 wt. % of a copolymer of styrene-acrylonitrile (SAN) containing<br>
67.5 wt.% styrene and 32.5 wt.% acrylonitrile (weight-average molecular<br>
weight of 133,000 g/mole).<br>
The component designated ASA 1 - used in Examples 1 and 2-<br>
contained SAN grafted onto a crosslinked poly(butyl acrylate-acrylonitrile)<br>
rubber substrate having a monomodal particle size distribution and an<br>
average particle size of 0.15 microns.<br>
The component designated ASA 2 - used in Examples 3 and 4 was a<br>
blend of SAN-grafted butyl acrylate rubbers. In each of the components of this<br>
blend the acrylate rubber substrate had a core-shell structure wherein core<br>
contained styrene and the shell was crosslinked poly(butyl acrylate). The one<br>
SAN-grafted butyl acrylate had average particle sizes of 0.4 microns and the<br>
second SAN-grafted butyl acrylate had average particle sizes of 0.15 microns.<br>
The filler components contained:<br>
Chopped glass fibers having average length of 1/8" and an average<br>
filament diameter of 10 micrometers, PPG 3540.<br>
Milled glass fiber, average length 1/32" and average filament diameter of<br>
15.8 micrometers, a product of Owens Corning<br>
Wollastonite, average particle size of 8 micrometers, a product of Nyco.<br>
Each of the compositions further contained:<br>
N,N'-hexamethylene bis[3-(3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionamide] - an<br>
antioxidant -1 pphr (parts per one hundred weight of resin);<br>
2-(2'-hydroxy-3',5' -di-tert-amyi phenyl) benzotriazole - light absorber - 0. 5 pphr;<br>
bis(2,2,6,6,-tetramethyl-4-piperidinyl) sebacate- light stabilizer - 0. 5 pphr.<br>
Also included in each was 4.3 pphr of a color concentrate containing carbon<br>
black (25 % relative to the weight of the concentrate) and 75 wt % SAN<br>
copolymer (wt. 31% Acrylonitrile). None of the components is believed to have<br>
criticality in the present context.<br>
The percents of chopped glass fibers and milled glass fibers<br>
indicated in the tables below are in terms of percentage relative to the<br>
weight of molding compositions<br>
The results show that moldings made of the inventive compositions feature<br>
surface of bett+er quality than corresponding articles made of closely<br>
related compositions that do not contain the inventive filler.<br>
The results show that moldings made of the inventive compositions feature<br>

Although the invention has been described in detail in the foregoing for the<br>
 purpose of illustration, it is to be understood that such detail is solely for that<br>
purpose and that variations can be made therein by those skilled in the art<br>
without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention except as it may be<br>
limited by the claims.<br>
