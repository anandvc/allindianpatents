COMPLETE SPECIFICATION [See Section 10 and Rule 13]<br>
FLAME-RESISTANT, IMPACT-RESISTANT MODIFIED POLYCARBONATE<br>
	MOULDING AND EXTRUSION MASSES'<br>
BAYER AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT, a body corporate organised under the laws of Germany, D-51368, Leverkusen, Germany,<br>
The  following  specification  particularly describes  and  ascertains  the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to flame resistant graft polymer-modified polycarbonate moulding compositions containing phosphate compounds, which compositions exhibit excellent flame retardancy, very good mechanical properties and elevated heat resistance.<br>
piphosphates are known as flame retardant additives; JP 59 202 240 describes the production of such a product from phosphorus oxychloride, diphenols such as hydroquinone or bisphenol A and monophenols such as phenol or cresol. These diphosphates may be used as flame retardants in polyamide or polycarbonate. However, this document makes no reference to improved heat resistance due to the addition of the oligomeric phosphate to polycarbonate moulding compositions.<br>
EP-A 0 363 608 describes flame resistant polymer blends prepared from aromatic polycarbonate, copolymer or graft copolymer containing styrene together with oligomeric phosphates as flame retardant.<br>
EP-A 0 767 204 describes flame resistant polyphenylene oxide (PPO) or polycarbonate mixtures which contain a mixture of oligophosphates (of the bisphenol A (BPA) oligophosphate type) and monophosphates as the flame retardant. Elevated flame retardant contents give rise to disadvantageous mechanical properties and reduced heat resistance.<br>
EP-A 0 611 798 and WO 96/27600 describe moulding compositions which, in addition to polycarbonate, contain oligomeric, terminally alkylated phosphoric acid esters of the BPA type. Due to the alkylation, elevated contents are required in order to achieve effective flame retardancy, which is highly disadvantageous for many applicational properties (mechanical properties, heat resistance).<br><br>
Le A 33 591-Foreign<br>
EP-A 0 754 531 describes reinforced PC/ABS moulding compositions which are suitable for precision components. Flame retardants which are used also include inter alia BPA type oligophosphates. The elevated filler contents have a highly disadvantageous effect on mechanical properties.<br>
EP-A 771 851  describes moulding compositions which contain aromatic polycarbonate, graft polymer based on diene rubber/SAN copolymer, a phosphate and tetrafluoroethylene polymers, wherein the polycarbonate has differing molecular weights. Resistance to loss of impact strength, to heat and moisture is stated as the advantage.<br>
EP-A 755 977 describes polymer blends prepared from aromatic polycarbonate, graft copolymer having a rubber content of 
EP-A 747 424 describes thermoplastic resins which contain phosphate compounds having a molecular weight of approx. 500 to 2000 and of phosphate compounds having a molecular weight of approx. 2300 to 11000 as the flame retardant, wherein numerous thermoplastic resins are listed. The elevated molecular weights of the phosphorus compounds distinctly impairs flow behaviour of the moulding compositions.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide flame retardant, graft polymer-modified PC moulding compositions, which are distinguished by very good mechanical properties, elevated heat resistance and a low burn time in fire behaviour, as a result of which these moulding compositions are suitable for the production of housing components of a complicated geometry.<br><br><br>
LeA33 591-Foreign<br>
It has now been found that graft polymer-modified polycarbonate moulding compositions which contain phosphorus compounds having a selected number of repeat units have the desired range of properties.<br>

Monomers B.l are preferably mixtures of<br>
B.l.l 50 to 99 parts by weight of vinyl aromatics and/or ring-substituted vinyl aromatics (such as for example styrene, a-methylstyrene, p-methylstyrene, p-chlorostyrene) and/or (meth)acrylic acid (C,-Cg)-alkyl esters (such as for example methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate) and<br>
B.l.2 1 to 50 parts by weight of vinyl cyanides (unsaturated nitriles such as acrylonitrile and methacrylonitrile) and/or (meth)acrylic acid (C1-C8)-alkyl esters (such as for example methyl methacrylate, n-butyl acrylate, t.-butyl acrylate) and/or derivatives (such as anhydrides and imides) of unsaturated carboxylic acids (for example maleic anhydride and N-phenylmaleimide).<br>
Preferred monomers B.l.l are selected from among at least one of the monomers styrene, a-methylstyrene and methyl methacrylate, preferred monomers B.l.2 are selected from among at least one of the monomers acrylonitrile, maleic anhydride and methyl methacrylate.<br>

Preferred grafting backbones B.2 are diene rubbers (for example based on butadiene, isoprene etc.) or mixtures of diene rubbers or. copolymers of diene rubbers or mixtures thereof with further copolymerisable monomers (for example according to B.l.l and B. 1.2), providing that the glass transition temperature of component B.2 is 
Pure polybutadiene rubber is particularly preferred.<br>
Particularly preferred polymers B are, for example, ABS polymers (emulsion, bulk and suspension ABS), as are described for example in DE-OS 2 035 390 (=US patent 3 644 574) or in DE-OS 2 248 242 (= GB patent 1 409 275) or in Ullmann, Enzyklopddie der Technischen Chemie, volume 19 (1980), pp. 280 et seq.. The gel content of the grafting backbone B.2 is at least 30 wt.%, preferably at least 40 wt.% (measured in toluene).<br>
The graft copolymers B are produced by free-radical polymerisation, for example by emulsion, suspension, solution or bulk polymerisation, preferably by emulsion polymerisation or bulk polymerisation.<br>

(co)polymerisation of the graft monomers in the presence of the grafting backbone and are also isolated during working up.<br>
