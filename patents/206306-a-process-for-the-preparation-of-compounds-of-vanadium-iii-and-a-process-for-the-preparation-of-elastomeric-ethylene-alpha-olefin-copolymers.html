CATALYTIC COMPONENT BASED ON VANADIUM AND ITS USE IN THE PREPARATION OF EP(D)M,<br>
The present invention relates to catalytic components and their use in the preparation of (co)polymers of alpha-olefins, particularly in the preparation of elastomeric ethylene-propylene (EPM) copolymers and ethylene-propylene-diene (EPDM) terpolymers.<br>
It is known in literature that effective catalytic components for the (co)polymerization of alpha-olefins consist of organic compounds of Vanadium (in oxidation state 3 or 5) soluble in hydrocarbon solvents. Typical examples of the above organic compounds of Vanadium are:<br>
Vanadyl trihalides, alkoxyhalides and alkoxides<br>
such as VOCI3, VOCl2(OBu) and VO(OC2H5)3;<br>
Vanadium tetrahalides and Vanadium alkoxy halides<br>
such as VC1A and VCl3(OBu);<br>
Vanadium and Vanadyl acetyl acetonates and chloro<br>
acetyl acetonates, such as V(AcAc)3, VOCl2(AcAc),<br><br>
VO(AcAc)2 wherein (AcAc) is an acetylacetonate;<br>
Complexes between Vanadium halide and Lewis bases<br>
such as VC13.2THF wherein THF is tetrahydrofuran.<br>
The preferred Vanadium compound is V(III) acetyl acetonate.<br>
The above Vanadium compounds are used in the presence of cocatalysts essentially consisting of organic compounds of Aluminium and optionally in the presence of halogenated promoters.<br>
The Vanadium compounds of the prior art have the disadvantage however of an insufficient productivity.<br>
New compounds of Vanadium soluble in hydrocarbon solvents have now been found which overcome the above inconveniences.<br>
In accordance with this, the present invention relates to compounds of Vanadium having the general formula VLj, wherein V is trivalent Vanadium and L is a ligand having general formula (I):<br><br>
wherein R is selected from H and monofunctional hydrocarbyl radicals, it is preferably selected from H and C-C hydrocarbyl radicals; n is an integer between<br><br>
2 and 13 excluding 4 and 5, and is preferably seiecteu<br>
from 2 and 3.<br>
The compounds having general formula VL^ which are most preferred are those selected from Vanadium (III) 2-acetyl cyclopentanoate and V(III) 2-formylcyclopenta-noate, the preferred being V(III) 2-formylcyclopenta-noate.<br>
The complex having general formula VLj can be prepared by the reaction of a Vanadium (III) halide with the compound LH, i.e. with the ketone corresponding to the ligand having general formula (I), for example with 2-formylcyclopentanone or 2-acetylcyclo-pentanone.<br>
A further object of the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of compounds having general formula VLj which comprises the reaction of a Vanadium (III) trihalide, preferably Vanadium (III) trichloride, with a cycloalkanone, excluding cyclohexa-none and cycloheptanone, substituted in one of the alpha positions with respect to the ketone with an R-CO- radical, wherein R has the meaning defined above.<br>
The reaction preferably takes place at a temperature of between 0*C and 100°C.<br>
In the preferred embodiment the V(III) trihalide and cycloalkanone are reacted (in an almost equimolar<br><br>
quantity) in water, an environment in which the VL^ formed is practically insoluble. The VLj can be easily recovered by extraction with an organic solvent, for example toluene.<br>
A further object of the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of elastomeric ethylene/ a lpha-olef in copolymers, preferably ethylene-propylene, and optionally a third dienic monomer, in suspension of liquid monomer, in the presence of a catalyst containing Vanadium and a cocatalyst basically consisting of an organic compound of Aluminium and optionally in the presence of a halogenated promoter, characterized in that the catalyst containing Vanadium is selected from those having general formula VLj, wherein V is trivalent Vanadium and L is a ligand<br><br>
wherein R is selected from H and C^-C2Q monofunctional hydrocarbyl radicals, and is preferably selected from H and C^-Cj hydrocarbyl radicals; n is an integer selected from between 2 and 3 or between 6 and 13, preferably between 2 and 3, and even more preferably 2.<br><br>
The elastomeric copolymers which can be obtained with the process of the present invention contain from 35 to 85% by weight of ethylene, preferably from 45% to 75% by weight, and have an intrinsic viscosity, determined in o-dichlorobenzene at 135°C, of between 0.5 and 6 dl/g, preferably from 1 to 3 dl/g.<br>
The term alpha-olefins refers to alpha-olefins having from 3 to 10 carbon atoms, for example propylene, butene-1, pentene-1, hexene-1; it is preferably however for the higher alpha-olefin to be propylene, thus obtaining the so-called EPM elastomeric copolymers.<br>
As is known to experts in the field, ethylene and alpha-olefins can be copolymerized with other dienic monomers to give EPDM elastomeric terpolymers. In this case the content of diene must be less than 20%, preferably from 2 to 15%.<br>
These termonomers can be selected from: 00 dienes with a linear chain such as 1, 4-hexadiene and 1,6-octadiene;<br>
00 acyclic dienes with a branched chain such as 5-methyl-l,4-hexadiene; 3,7-dimethyl-l,6-octadiene; 3,7-dimethyl-l,7-octadiene;<br>
0 ° acyclic dienes with a single ring such as 1,4-cyclohexadiene; 1,5-cyclooctadiene; 1,5-cyclodode-<br><br>
cadiene;<br>
00 dienes having bridge-linked alicyclic rings such as methyltetrahydroindene; dicyclopentadiene; bicyclo [2.2.2]hepta2,5-2,5-diene; alkenyl, alkylidene, cycloa-lkenyl and cycloalkylidene norbornenes such as 5-methy-lene-2-norbornene; 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene (ENB); 5-propenyl-2-norbornene.<br>
Among the non-conjugated dienes typically used for preparing these copolymers, dienes containing at least a double bond in a stretched ring, are preferred, even more preferably 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene (ENB).<br>
In the preparation process of elastomeric copolymers the compound VL3 is used together with a cocatalyst selected from those having the general formula RnAlXm wherein R is a  ^-C^ alkyl  radical, X is a halogen, m+n =3, m is an integer from 0 to 2.<br>
Alkyl Aluminium chlorides such as A1(C2H5)2C1, A1(C2H5)C12, are particularly useful, the most preferred being diethylaluminium chloride.<br>
The molar ratio between cocatalyst and Vanadium can vary from 5 to 1000, preferably from 9 to 60.<br>
In the copolymerization process in addition to the Vanadium compound of the present invention and the cocatalyst, it is preferable, as is known to experts in the field, to also use a catalysis promoter. These<br><br>
catalysis promoters normally belong to the group of chlorinated organic compounds, for example ethyl trichloroacetate, n-butyl perchlorocrotonate, diethyl dichloromalonate, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform. The molar ratio between promoter and Vanadium can vary from 0/1 to 1000/1, preferably from 0.5/1 to 40/1, even more preferably from 1/1 to 10/1.<br>
The process of the present invention is carried out in solution or in suspension, preferably in suspension, in a reaction medium in which the polymer is substantially insoluble.<br>
In the preferred embodiment the reaction medium prevalently consists of one of the comonomers, to which a saturated hydrocarbon, such as propane, butane, pentane, hexane or aromatics, preferably propane, is optionally added as diluent.<br>
The polymerization temperature is maintained at a value of between -5°C and 65°C, preferably from 25°C to 50°C. The contact times vary from 10 minutes to 6 hours, preferably from 15 minutes to 1 hour.<br>
The polymerization is generally carried out with hydrogen as moderator and molecular weight regulator, operating at a total pressure from 5 to 100 bars, preferably from 8 to 30 bars, with a ratio between partial ethylene pressure and partial hydrogen pressure<br><br>
of more than 4, preferably more than 20. Other compounds however, for example diethylzinc, can be used as molecular weight regulators.<br>
The catalytic component of the present invention, under the same conditions, gives higher catalytic yields with respect to the catalytic components of the prior art, for example Vanadium (III) acetylacetonate.<br>
The following examples provide a better understanding of the present invention. EXAMPLES<br>
All the reagents are commercial products; the solvents used in the polymerization and the promoters were- deaerated under nitrogen and anhydrified on alumina and molecular sieves.<br>
The organic compounds of aluminium were used in solution diluted in hexane.<br>
The complexes of Vanadium were characterized by 1HNMR spectrum with a Bruker AM 3 00 spectrometer at room temperature. The samples were prepared by dissolving the compounds in deuterated toluene.<br>
The signals observed, as a result of the paramagnetic nucleus of the Vanadium, are distributed over a region ranging from about 94 to 150 ppm.<br>
The copolymers obtained in the following examples were characterized as follows:<br><br>
A)   The composition and product of the reactivity ratios (rrr2) were determined by infra-red analysis of :he polymer in the form of 0.2 mm thick films using an !TIR spectrophotometer of Perkin Elmer model 1760.<br>
