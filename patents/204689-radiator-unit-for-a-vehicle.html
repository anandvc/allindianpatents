&amp;<br>
THE PATENTS RULES, 2003<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"A RADIATOR UNIT FOR A VEHICLE"<br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, having a place of business at 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a radiator unit for a vehicle having a radiator, which is provided, on the top portion thereof, with a water supply cap to be opened or closed by a rotational operation and is mounted on a vehicle, and a radiator "Vcover fixed to the radiator such that it covers the radiator from the outside.<br><br>
[RELATED ART]<br>
A conventional radiator unit is already disclosed in Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. 63-106320.<br>
[PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION] In this connection, a water supply cap can be opened or closed by a rotational operation, and in the conventional unit disclosed in the above gazette, the water supply cap is covered with a grill fixed to the radiatdr to prevent the water supply cap from being operated out of mischief but no thought is put into keeping the closed position of the water supply cap. Further, it is impossible to judge, in the state in which the water supply cap is covered with the grill, whether the water supply cap is at a closed position or at an open position, and hence a work for checking the position of the water supply cap is required when the grill is assembled, which makes assembling work more troublesome.<br>
The present invention has been made in view of such circumstances, and the object of the present invention is to provide a radiator unit for a vehicle capable of preventing parts from increasing in number, improving the efficiency of assembling, and keeping the water supply cap at the closed position.<br><br>
[MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEM]<br>
In order to accomplish the above object, the invention as claimed in claim 1 is a radiator unit for a vehicle comprising<br><br><br>
a radiator, which has a water supply cap opened or closed by v a rotational operation on its top and is mounted on a vehicle, and a radiator cover which covers the radiator from the outside and is mounted on the radiator, and is characterized in that a position regulating part which is engaged with the water supply cap at a closed position to enable the radiator cover to be mounted on the radiator and to prevent the water supply cap from turning to an open position is integrally mounted on the radiator cover such that it covers the water supply cap.<br>
According to such a constitution, in the case where the radiator cover is mounted on the radiator, when the water supply cap is at the closed position, the position regulating part is engaged with the water supply cap to mount the radiator cover on the radiator. Therefore, this can eliminates the need for specially checking that the water supply cap is at the closed position and makes it possible to check the position of the water supply cap only by mounting the radiator cover on the radiator and can improve assembling performance.  Still further, the position regulating part of the radiator cover is engaged with the water supply cap to prevent the water supply cap from turning from the closed position to the open position. Therefore, it is possible to prevent the parts from increasing in number and to keep the water supply cap at the closed position.<br>
Further, the invention as claimed in claim 2 is characterized in that a cutaway portion to expose a part of<br><br>
the  water   supply  cap   to   the  outside   is  made   in  the  position regulating  part,    in  addition   to   the   constitution  of   the invention  as   claimed   in   claim  1.     According   to   such  a constitution,   it  is possible  to  easily check  the presence of the water  supply cap  from the outside  of  the  radiator  cover.<br>
The present invention relates to a radiator unit for a vehicle comprising a radiator, which has a water supply cap opened or closed by a rotational operation on its top and is mounted on a vehicle, and a radiator cover, which covers the radiator from the outside and is mounted on the radiator, characterized in that a position regulating part, which is engaged with the water supply cap at a closed position to enable the radiator cover to be mounted on the radiator and to prevent the water supply cap from turning to an open position, is integrally mounted on the radiator cover such that it covers the water supply cap.<br><br>

First, in FIG. 1 to FIG. 2, a vehicle body frame F of a scooter type motorcycle V provided with a front wheel Wf steered by a steering handlebar 11 and a rear wheel Wr driven by a swing type power unit P is divided into three parts of a front frame 12, a center frame 13, and a rear frame 14. The front frame 12 is formed of a casting of aluminum alloy<br><br>
integrally provided with a head pipe 12a, a down tube 12b and r  a step floor support part 12c.  The center frame 13 for supporting the power unit P such that the power unit P can swing up and down via a pivot shaft 15 is formed of a casting of aluminum alloy and is joined to the rear end of the front frame 12 .  The rear frame 14 extending backward upward of the power unit P is formed of a circular pipe and a fuel tank 16 is supported on the top thereof. A helmet case 17 is supported on the top of the center frame 13 and the helmet case 17 and the fuel tank 16 are covered with a cover 19 having a seat 18 integrally formed therewith, wherein the cover 19 can be opened and closed.<br>
The power unit P includes a water-cooled single cylinder 4-cycle engine E, a belt type continuously variable transmission T extending from the left side of the engine E toward the rear of a vehicle body, and the rear top surface of the continuously variable transmission T is joined to the rear end of the center frame 13 via a rear cushion 20. An air cleaner 21 is supported on the top surface of the continuously variable transmission T and a muffler 22 is supported on the right side of the continuously variable transmission T and a main stand 23 which can stand and tilt is supported on the bottom surface of the engine E.<br>
In FIG. 3 to FIG. 5, the engine main unit 25 of the engine E has a first engine block 32 and a second engine block 33 which are divided by a dividing surface 30 extending in the vertical<br><br>
direction along a crankshaft 31. The first engine block 32 is integrally provided with a cylinder block 32a in which a cylinder bore 41 is made and a crankcase half part 32b which constitutes a crankcase with the second engine block 33, and a cylinder head 34 is joined to the front end of the first engine block 32, and a head cover 35 is joined to the front end of the cylinder head 34.<br><br>
Such an engine main unit 25 is mounted on the vehicle body frame F along the front and rear direction of the vehicle body frame F with the axis L of the cylinder bore 41 slightly sloped upward, and a bracket 27 provided on the top of the first engine block 32 is supported by a pivot shaft 15 fixed to the center frame 13 of the vehicle body frame F via a mount rubber 28 such that it can swing.<br>
The belt type continuously variable transmission T has a right side casing 37 and a left side casing 38 which are joined to each other and the front right side of the right side casing 37 is joined to the left side of the first and second engine blocks 32, 33. Further, a speed reduction gear casing 39 is joined to the rear right side of the right side casing 37.<br>
A piston 42 slidably fitted in the cylinder bore 41 made in the first engine block 32 is connected to the crankshaft 31 via a connecting rod 43. A cam shaft 44 is rotatably supported by the cylinder head 34, and an intake valve and an exhaust valve (both not shown) provided on the cylinder head<br><br>
34 are opened and closed by the cam shaft 44. A timing chain 45 is received in a chain passage 40 made in the first engine block 32 and the timing chain 45 is looped around a drive sprocket 46 mounted on the crankshaft 31 and a driven sprocket 47 mounted on the cam shaft 44, whereby the cam shaft 44 is rotated one revolution per two revolutions of the crankshaft 31.<br>
A drive pulley 54 is provided on the left end of the crankshaft 31 projecting inside the right side casing 37 and the left side casing 38. The drive pulley 54 has a fixed side pulley half body 55 fixed to the crankshaft 31 and a moving side pulley half body 56 capable of moving close to or away from the fixed side pulley half body 55 . The moving side pulley half body 56 is energized in the direction close to the fixed side pulley half body 55 by a centrifugal weight 57 moving outside in the radial direction in response to an increase in the revolution of the crankshaft 31.<br>
[0017]<br>
A driven pulley 59 mounted on an output shaft 58 supported between the rear portion of the right side casing 37 and the speed reduction gear casing 39 is provided with a fixed side pulley half body 60 relatively rotatably supported by the output shaft 58 and a moving side pulley half body 61 moving close to or away from the fixed side pulley half body 60, and the moving side pulley half body 61 is energized toward the fixed side pulley half body 60 by a spring 62. Further, a starting clutch 63 is provided between the fixed side pulley<br><br>
half body 60 and the output shaft 58. An endless V-belt 64 is looped between the drive pulley 54 and the driven pulley 59.<br>
A middle shaft 65 and an axle 66, which are parallel to the output shaft 58, are supported between the right side casing 37 and the speed reduction gear casing 39, and a speed reducing gear train 67 is provided between the output shaft 58, the middle shaft 65 and the axle 66. The rear wheel Wr is provided on the right end of the axle 66 passing through the speed reduction gear casing 39 and projecting to the right side.<br>
The rotational power of the crankshaft 31 is transmitted to the drive pulley 54 and then from the drive pulley 54 to the V-belt 64, the driven pulley 59, the starting clutch 63, the speed reducing gear train 67, and finally to the rear wheel Wr.<br>
When the engine E is rotated at low speeds, a centrifugal force applied to the centrifugal weight 57 of the drive pulley 54 is small and hence the groove width between the fixed side pulley half body 60 and the moving side pulley half body 61 is decreased by the spring 62 of the driven pulley 59 and a transmission gear ratio becomes LOW. When the number of revolution of the crankshaft 31 increases from this state, the centrifugal force applied to the centrifugal weight 57 increases and the groove width between the fixed side pulley half body 55 and the moving side pulley half body 56 of the drive pulley 54 decreases, and as the groove decreases, the<br><br>
groove width between the fixed side pulley half body 60 and the moving side pulley half body 61 of the driven pulley 59 increases.  Therefore, the transmission gear ratio is continuously variably changed from the LOW to the TOP.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 6 in combination, a rotor 69 is fixed to the right side of the crankshaft 31, and a stator 70 constituting an alternator 68 in cooperation with the rotor 69 is fixed to the first and second engine blocks 32, 33 such that the stator 70 is surrounded by the rotor 69. A cooling fan 71 is fixed to the right end of the crankshaft 31 outside the alternator 68 and a radiator 72 is arranged such that the radiator 72 and the alternator 68 sandwiches the cooling fan 71. A support case 73 provided on the radiator 72 is fixed to the first and second engine blocks 32, 33 such that the support case 73 surrounds the cooling fan 71, and the radiator 72 is covered from the outside with a radiator cover 74, which is made of synthetic resin and is fixed to the support case 73 of the radiator 72.<br>
WZTT<br>
Referring now to FIG. 7 and FIG. 8 in combination, a louver 75 for introducing air from the outside surface is provided on the outside of the radiator cover 74 and a plurality of discharge ports 76 are made in the support case 73 on the side of the cooling fan 71. When the cooling fan 71 is operated, the air introduced from the louver 75 passes through the radiator 72 to cool the radiator 72 and is discharged outside from the discharge ports 76.<br><br><br>
The radiator 72 has an upper tank 77, a lower tank 78, a cooling core 79 for connecting the upper and lower tanks 77, 78, and the support case 73. The support case 73 is fixed to the upper and lower tanks 77, 78. In this manner, the cooling air introduced from the louver 75 into the radiator 72 side passes through the cooling core 79 to cool cooling water in the radiator 72.<br>
The radiator 72 constitutes a part of a cooling unit 83 for circulating the cooling water of a water jacket 82 provided on a cylinder block 32a and a cylinder head 34 of the first engine block 32 in the engine main unit 25. The cooling unit 83 includes a water pump 84 for supplying the cooling water to the water jacket 82, the radiator 72 interposed between the water jacket 82 and the inlet port of the water pump 84, and a thermostat for changing the state in which the cooling water from the water jacket 82 bypasses the radiator 72 and returns to the water pump 84 and the state in which the cooling water passing through the radiator 72 from the water jacket 82 returns to the water pump 84 according to the temperature of the cooling water.<br><br>
A thermostat case 86 receiving the thermostat 85 therein is joined to the right side of the cylinder head 34 and the water pump 84 provided on the right side end of a cam shaft 44 is received in a space surrounded by the cylinder head 34 and the thermostat case 86.<br><br><br>
A water supply pipe 87 extending upward is provided on one end of the upper tank 72 along the front and rear direction of the vehicle body frame F (the rear end portion in this embodiment) and a water supply cap 88 opened or closed by a rotational operation is mounted on the top end of the water supply pipe 87. Further, a connection pipe 89 projecting forward is integrally formed with the other end of the lower tank 78 along the front and rear direction of the vehicle body frame F (the front end portion in this embodiment).<br>
The radiator 72 like this is mounted on the first and second engine blocks 32, 33 of the engine main unit 25 in a position slanting at an angle Oi with respect to the axis L of a cylinder bore 41 made in the engine main unit 25 . Accordingly, when the engine main unit 25 is mounted on the vehicle body frame F, the radiator 72 is in a position slanting forward at an angle )3 with respect to a horizontal plane and the water supply cap 88 is arranged at the uppermost position in the cooling unit 83 and the connection pipe 89 is arranged at the lowest position in the cooling unit 83.<br>
By setting the radiator 72 in the position slanting at the angle Oi with respect to the axis L of the cylinder bore 41, it is possible to dispose the radiator 72 in such a way that the engine main unit 25 avoids a pivot shaft 25 for supporting the vehicle body frame F and to secure a space in which an exhaust pipe 90 connected to the exhaust port of the<br><br>
cylinder head 32 is arranged in the rear direction of the radiator 72 to improve the degree of flexibility in the arrangement of the exhaust pipe 90.<br>
The one end of a first conduit 91 made of a rubber hose or the like and for introducing the cooling water of the radiator 72 to the thermostat 85 side is connected to the connection pipe 89 of the radiator 72 and the other end of the first conduit<br>
91	is connected to a thermostat case 86.<br>
The radiator 72 is disposed at a position where at least part of the upper tank 77 (front portion in this embodiment) overlaps the cylinder block 32a of the engine main unit 25 when viewed from the side. A second conduit 92, whose one end is connected to the cylinder block 32a such that it is connected to the upper portion of the water jacket 25, is disposed in the range where the upper tank 77 overlaps the cylinder block 32a when viewed from the side such that the second conduit 92 extends nearly horizontally with respect to the direction of width of a motorcycle, and the other end of the second conduit<br>
92	is connected to the front portion of the upper tank 77.<br><br>
The one end of the third conduit 93 made of a rubber hose or the like and for introducing the cooling water from the water pump 84 is connected to the thermostat case 86 and the other end of the third conduit 93 is connected to a connection pipe 94 provided on the cylinder block 32a of the first engine block 32 such that it communicates with the bottom portion of the<br><br>
water jacket 82.<br>
A pipe (not shown) for introducing the cooling water from the water jacket 82 is connected to a carburetor 95 connected to the intake port of the cylinder head 32 so as to increase the temperature of the carburetor 95 and the forth conduit 96 made of a rubber hose or the like and for introducing the cooling water having increased the temperature of the carburetor 95 is connected to the thermostat case 86.<br>
The fifth conduit 97 made of a rubber hose or the like and for purging air from the water pump 84 is connected to the top of the thermostat case 86. The fifth conduit 97 and a conduit (not shown) connected to the top of the cylinder block 32a so as to purge air from the top of the water jacket 82 are connected in common to the sixth conduit 98 made of a rubber hose or the like and the sixth conduit 98 is connected to the rear top portion of the upper tank 77 of the radiator 72.<br>
Further, one end of a seventh conduit 100 made of a rubber hose or the like is connected to a water supply pipe 87 and the other end of the seventh conduit 100 is connected to a reservoir (not shown) which is open to atmosphere and is disposed apart from the radiator 72.  When the cooling water in the radiator 72 increases in temperature and is expanded, the extra cooing water overflows into the reservoir and when the cooling water in the radiator 72 decreases in temperature, the cooling water is returned from the reservoir to the radiator<br><br>
72. By the flow of the cooling water between the radiator 72 and the reservoir in this manner, the air stored in the water supply pipe 87 is discharged. That is, when the engine E is driven, the air can be purged from the cooling unit 83.<br>
In the cooling unit 83 like this, in the state in which the warming-up of the engine E is finished, the cooling water discharged from the water pump 84 driven by the cam shaft 44 is supplied to the water jacket 82 in the first engine block 32 and the cylinder head 34 via the thermostat case 86 and the third conduit 93 and cools the engine E while it passes through the water jacket 82 and then is supplied to the upper tank 77 of the radiator 72 via the second conduit 92. The cooling water flows from the upper tank 77 through the cooling core 79 to the lower tank 78 and decreases in temperature while it flows the radiator 72 and is returned to the water pump 84 through the first conduit 91 and the thermostat 85. On the other hand, when the engine E is in warming-up and the temperature of the cooling water is low, the thermostat 85 works so that the cooling water bypasses the radiator 72 and circulates, and the cooling water does not pass through the radiator 72 but circulates through the water jacket 82, the carburetor 95, and the water pump 84 and rapidly increases in temperature.<br>
Referring to FIG. 7 and FIG. 8, a position regulating part 74a, which engages with a water supply cap 88 at a closed position and enables the radiator cover 74 to be fixed to the radiator 72 and prevents the water supply cap 88 from turning<br><br>
to an open position, is integrally fixed to the radiator cover 74, which is fixed to the support case  of the radiator 72 so that the radiator cover 74 covers the radiator 72, in such a way that the position regulating part 74a covers the water supply cap 88. Further, a cutaway portion 99 to expose a part of the water supply cap 88 to the outside is made in the position regulating part 74a.<br>
UMZTT<br>
Next, describing the operation of the present embodiment, in the radiator 72 constituting a part of the cooling unit 83 capable of circulating the cooling water of the water jacket 82 provided in the engine main unit 25, a water supply pipe 87 extending upward is integrally fixed to the rear end portion of the upper tank 77 along the front and rear direction of the vehicle body frame F, and the water supply cap 88 is removably mounted on the top end of the water supply pipe 87, and the radiator 72 is mounted on the engine main unit 25 in a position slanting at an angle |3 with respect to a horizontal plane such that the water supply cap 88 is disposed at the uppermost position in the cooling unit 83. That is, by slanting forward with respect to the horizontal plane the radiator 72 having an ordinary shape and provided with the upper and lower tanks<br>
77,	78 and the cooling core 79 for connecting these tanks 77,<br>
78,	the cap 88 mounted on the top end portion of the water supply pipe 87 provided on the rear end portion of the upper tank 77 is disposed at the uppermost position in the cooling unit 83.<br>
Therefore, it is possible to avoid an increase in costs<br><br>
caused by forming the radiator 72 into a specific shape and by providing a tank, connected to the radiator 72 and disposed apart from the radiator 72, with a water supply cap, and to improve performance in air purging and water pouring from the water supply pipe 87 by comparatively increasing a head difference in the cooling unit 83 when water is poured from the water supply pipe 87.<br><br><br><br>
Further, a connection pipe 89 for connecting the first conduit 91, which introduces the cooling water from the radiator 72 to the thermostat 85, is fixed to the front end portion of the lower tank 78 along the front and rear direction of the vehicle body frame F, and the slanting position of the radiator 72 is set with respect to the horizontal plane such that the connection pipe 89 is disposed at the lowest position in the cooling unit 83. Therefore, it is possible to purge air from the bottom portion in the cooling unit 83 and to increase the performance in pouring water without increasing the length of the cooling core 79 of the radiator 72.<br><br>
Further, the radiator 72 is disposed at the position where at least a part of the upper tank 77 overlaps the cylinder block 32a when viewed from the side, and one end of the second conduit 92 disposed in the range where the upper tank 77 overlaps the cylinder block 32a when viewed from the side and extending nearly horizontally is connected to the cylinder block 32a so that it is connected to the water jacket 82 and the other end of the second conduit 92 is connected to the upper tank 77.<br><br>
Therefore, it is possible to shorten the second conduit 92 for connecting the radiator 72 and the cylinder block 32a so as to flow the cooling water between the water jacket 82 and the radiator 72 and to make the cooling water circulation circuit in the cooling unit 83 compact in size.<br>
Still further, the position regulating part 74a, which engages with the water supply cap 88 at the closed position and enables the radiator cover 74 to be mounted on the radiator 72 and prevents the water supply cap 88 from turning to the open position, is integrally fixed to the radiator cover 74 such that it covers the water supply cap 88.  Accordingly, in the case where the radiator cover 74 is mounted on the radiator 72, when the water supply cap 88 is at the closed position, the position regulating part 74a is engaged with the water supply cap 88 to mount the radiator cover 74 on the radiator 72.  Therefore, this can eliminates the need for specially checking that the water supply cap 88 is at the closed position and makes it possible to check the position of the water supply cap 88 only by mounting the radiator cover 74 on the radiator 72 and can improve assembling performance. <br>
Still further, the position regulating part 74a of the radiator cover 74 is engaged with the water supply cap 88 to prevent the water supply cap 88 from turning from the closed position to the open position. Therefore, it is possible to prevent the parts from increasing in number and to keep the water supply cap 88 at the closed position.<br><br>
Still further, since the position regulating part 74a is provided with the cutaway portion 99 to expose a part of the water supply cap 88 to the outside, it is possible to easily check the presence of the water supply cap 88 from the outside of the radiator cover 74.<br><br>
While the embodiment of the present invention has been described above, the present invention is not limited to the above embodiment but may be variously modified in design within the spirit and scope defined by the appended claims.<br>
10 045],<br>
For example, while the case where the present invention is applied to the motorcycle V has been described in the above embodiment, the present invention can be also applied to the other vehicle such as a three-wheeled vehicle.<br>
[EFFECT OF THE INVENTION]<br>
As described above, according to the invention as claimed in claim 1, it is possible to check the position of the water supply cap only by mounting the radiator cover on the radiator and hence to improve the assembling performance. Further, it is possible to prevent the water supply cap from turning from the closed position to the open position by mounting the radiator cover on the radiator. Therefore, it is possible to avoid the parts from increasing in number and to keep the water cap at the closed position.<br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br><br>
1.	A radiator unit for a vehicle comprising a radiator (72), which has a water supply cap (88) opened or closed by a rotational operation on its top and is mounted on a vehicle, and a radiator cover (74), which covers the radiator (72) from the outside and is mounted on the radiator (72), characterized in that a position regulating part (74a), which is engaged with the water supply cap (88) at a closed position to enable the radiator cover 74 to be mounted on the radiator (72) and to prevent the water supply cap (88) from turning to an open position, is integrally mounted on the radiator cover (74) such that it covers the water supply cap (88).<br>
2.	A radiator unit for vehicle as claimed in claim 1, wherein a cutaway portion (99) for exposing a part of the water supply cap (88) to the outside is made in the position regulating part (74a).<br>
