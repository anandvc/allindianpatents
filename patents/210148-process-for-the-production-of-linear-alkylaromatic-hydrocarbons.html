PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF LINEAR ALKYLAROMATIC HYDROCARBONS<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the production of linear alkyl aromatic hydrocarbons.<br>
More specifically, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of linear alkylbenze-nes (LAB) containing from 10 to 14 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain.<br>
Linear alkylbenzenes, for example containing from 10 to 14 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain, are generally intermediates which are used in the detergent industry.<br>
Processes for the synthesis of linear alkylbenzenes are known in the art. US patent 5.276.231 describes a process for the preparation of alkylaromatic derivatives, such as LAB, which consists in dehydrogenating a   paraffin stream and alkylating an aromatic compound, for example benzene, with this dehydrogenated stream. Hydrofluoric acid is used as alkylatiori catalyst .<br><br>
The by-products obtained in the first dehydrogenation step, essentially of an aromatic nature, are removed by adsorption on molecular sieves or by liquid-liquid extraction, as their presence reduces the activity of the alkylation catalyst and therefore the selectivity to LAB.<br>
The objective of the present invention is to increase the selectivity of the formation reaction of alkylbenzenes obtained by the continuous alkylation of benzene with mono-olefins coming from the dehydrogenation of n-paraffins and containing, as well as non-converted n-paraffins, the aromatic by-products produced during the dehydrogenation itself. A further objective of the present invention is to increase the selectivity of the dehydrogenation reaction.<br>
The Applicant has now found that these objectives, and others, can be reached by reducing the content of aromatic by-products present in the dehydrogenated stream to values of less than 1.2% by weight of the total in the stream, preferably less than 0.9%, without resorting to particular physical extraction treatment. This result can be obtained by effecting a hydrogenation reaction on the recycled paraffin stream coming from the alkylation and essentially consisting of paraffins and aromatic by-products as well as, posse-<br><br>
by, non-reacted olefins (present in traces) .<br>
The hydrogenation reaction of the recycled stream is carried out under particular conditions, as described hereunder, to transform the aromatic by-products into cycloparaffins.<br>
These cycloparaffins are subsequently partly dehydrogenated to cyclo-olefins and act as agents for alkylating the benzene in the alkylation and produce non-linear LAB (iso-LAB). The remaining cycloparaffins that are retransformed into aromatics in this phase, re-enter the cycle but their concentration in the feeding stream of the alkylation reactor is reduced under stationary conditions to values of less than 1.2%, generally less than 0.9%.<br>
US patent 5.276.231 discloses the possibility of hydrogenating the recycled paraffins. This hydrogenation however substantially has the purpose of eliminating the non-reacted olefins during the alkylation of benzene, as their presence is considered harmful for the dehydrogenation catalyst.<br>
The present invention therefore relates to a process for the production of linear alkylaromatic hydrocarbons, containing from 10 to 14 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain, comprising the following operating cycle:<br><br>
(a)	dehydrogenating   n-paraffins to the corresponding n-olefins obtaining a mixture also comprising diolefins and aromatic by-products as well as light cracking products and hydrogen;<br>
(b)	selectively hydrogenating the diolefins formed during step (a) into mono-olefins, obtaining a mixture essentially consisting of mono-olefins and n-paraffins, in addition to the aromatic by-products formed in step (a) ;<br>
(c)	feeding the stream coming from step (b) , together with a stream consisting of an aromatic hydrocarbon, to an alkylation unit in which an alkylation catalyst is present;<br>
(d)	feeding the alkylation product to a distillation section for the recovery of the excess aromatic hydrocarbon, a paraffinic stream essentially consisting of   n-paraffins and aromatic byproducts, and the alkylated aromatic product, respectively;<br>
(e)	subjecting the paraffinic stream coming from (d) to a hydrogenation step to transform the aromatic by-products into cycloparaffins;<br>
(f)	recycling the stream coming from step (e) to the dehydrogenation unit of step (a) .<br>
The   n-paraffins in. the charge are preferably<br><br>
introduced into the cycle before step (e).<br>
Step (a), for the dehydrogenation of n-paraffins, is carried out according to procedures well-known to experts in the field. The reaction is thus effected in the presence of a catalyst comprising a noble metal supported on porous material. The catalyst generally comprises an element of the platinum group in a ratio of O.Ol-j-2% by weight, with respect to the total (catalyst + carrier), an alkaline or earth-alkaline metal in a ratio of 0.1-’5% by weight, and it may optionally also contain a constituent selected from one or more of the following metals:<br>
tin: from 0.1 to 1% by weight;<br>
indium: from 0.1 to 1% by weight;<br>
tallium: from 0.1 to 1% by weight.<br>
In the case of the contemporary presence of indium and thallium, these are present in such quantities that the ratio In/Tl is a 0.3 whereas the ratio Pt/In + Tl is a 1.5.<br>
In addition, the dehydrogenation reaction of step<br>
(a) is carried out at a temperature ranging from 400 to<br>
500°C, at a pressure within the range of 0.1 to 10<br>
kg/cm’ and with a space velocity (LHSV) ranging from 0.1<br>
to 100 h'‘	 <br>
The dehydrogenation reaction preferably takes<br><br>
place in the presence of hydrogen, with a molar ratio hydrogen/n-paraffins ranging from 0.5 to 20, and only partially to reduce secondary cracking and isomerization reactions and the formation of by-products such as diolefins and aromatic hydrocarbons.<br>
At the end of the dehydrogenation reaction the stream essentially consists of linear mono-olefins (10-20% by weight), small quantities of non-linear olefins (generally less than 3% by weight), aromatic by-products (0.1-0.7% by weight), diolefins (0.5-3% by weight) and non-reacted n-paraffins.<br>
During the above step (a) for the dehydrogenation of n-paraffins to olefins, significant quantities of diolefins are therefore formed. Their extent is entirely linked to the conversion and conditions under which the dehydrogenation is carried out. Their presence subsequently leads, during the alkylation step (c), to the formation of impurities such as, for example, tetra lines in the alkylbenzenes and heavy, high-boiling products such as, for example, diphenyl alkanes, tetralines and indanes with a higher molecular weight.<br>
In order to reduce the disadvantages mentioned above, a selective hydrogenation of the diolefins, step (b) of the process of the present invention, to mono-olefins, is consequently effected.<br><br>
step (b) for the selective hydrogenation of the diolefins is carried out on a fixed-bed catalyst based on nickel supported on alumina, partially poisoned, or on a catalyst based on noble metals such as palladium supported on carbon or alumina. In any case, the ratio Hg/diolefins is maintained at more than 1 and, generally, between 1.1 and 5, depending on the catalyst used and the process conditions selected.<br>
The above step (b) can be carried out at a temperature ranging from 50 to 250°C depending on the type of catalyst used and at a pressure ranging from 1 to 2 0 kg/cm’, whereas the space velocity of the flow can vary from 0.5 to 20 h"'. In this way, conversion yields of the diolefins of up to 100% are obtained with a selectivity of up to 90%.<br>
The alkylation reaction, step (c) of the process of the present invention, is carried out after mixing the reagents with the alkylation catalyst. Any aromatic hydrocarbon can be used in the alkylation process of the present invention even if benzene and toluene are preferred.<br>
Catalysts which can be used for the purpose are those traditionally used in this type of reaction, for example HF or AICI3 or solid catalysts of an acidic nature (heterogeneous).<br><br>
The quantity of catalyst used generally ranges from 0.05% to 10% in moles with respect to the olefin whereas the molar ratio aromatic (benzene)/olefin is between 1 and 20, preferably between 3 and 15.<br>
The alkylation reaction of step (c) is generally carried out at a temperature ranging from 20 to 160°C, at a pressure ranging from 1 to 20 kg/cm’, for times varying from 5 to 180 minutes.<br>
At the end of the alkylation reaction a mixture is obtained, essentially consisting of alkylated product, paraffins and by-products coming from both the dehydro-genation and alkylation reactions. This mixture is consequently treated for the recovery of the alkylated product.<br>
The stream leaving the alkylation step is sent to a distillation section from which LAB is recovered with a purity of more than 99%.<br>
The linear alkylbenzene obtained according to the process of the present invention has improved characteristics in terms of purity and overall linearity. The content of cyclic compounds such as dialkyltetralines and dialkylindanes is reduced to values of less than 1% by weight, generally less than 0.5%.<br>
The excess aromatics hydrocarbon, recycled to the alkylation reactor, a paraffinic stream also containing<br><br>
the aromatic by-products formed during the dehydrogenations reaction (step (a) of the present invention) and a stream of high-boiling secondary products, are recovered from the distillation section.<br>
The high-boiling products prevalently consist (&gt; 80%) of polyalkylates having a molecular weight &gt; 350, with a high fraction of dialkylated having a molecular weight &gt; 360. These products can be used as such, for example as auxiliaries in the textile industry, or they can be subjected to further transformation and used as sulfonic acids with a high molecular weight in the lubricating field.<br>
The non-reacted n-paraffins during the dehydrate-nation step and the aromatic by-products formed during the same reaction are recovered from the distillation section. These aromatic products consist of at least 75% by weight of alkyl and polyalkylbenzenes and compounds with tetramine and naphthalene rings.<br>
The paraffinic stream is recycled to the dehydro-genation. To avoid the accumulation of the aromatic byproducts in the cycle, these are hydrogenated to the corresponding cycloparaffins in an appropriate unit.<br>
This second hydrogenation generally takes place<br>
with a fixed-bed catalyst under percolation conditions<br>
(trickle-bed) or immersed in the reagent liquid, even<br><br>
if there is also the possibility of operating in vapour phase.<br>
The catalysts and operating conditions can be selected by the expert in the field on the basis of his own experience and preferred technologies. In any case, the objective to be reached is the highest possible transformation of the aromatic by-products (at least higher than 90%).<br>
For example, in the case of a "trickle-bed" reactor, the hydrocarbon stream and hydrogen are in "down-flow" equicurrent at a pressure ranging from 1 to 100 Kg/cm’, preferably between 15 and 50 Kg/cm’, and a space velocity, calculated on the liquid charge at 20°C, ranging from 1 to 80 h"', preferably between 10 and 40 h"*" - The quantity of hydrogen is calculated on the stoichiometric value of the reaction with an excess equal to 20-30% in moles.<br>
The temperature can vary, depending on the cat<br>
list, from 50 to 500’C, preferably between 100 and<br>
250 	. .<br>
The hydrogenation catalyst consists of one or more metal components or their salts. These metals are selected from those belonging to group VIII and IVA of the periodic table of elements. Preferred metals, however, are nickel, platinum and palladium.<br><br>
The metal components are supported on inorganic inert materials such as alumina, silica, or their mixtures, clays, synthetic or natural zeolites, etc., in the physical form of cylinders, spherules, extruded products, etc.<br>
The reaction conditions of the hydrogenation phase of step (e) are deliberately more forced that those required for saturating olefinic double bonds. Consequently these, if present, are hydrogenated before the aroma i c compounds.<br>
A few illustrative examples are provided for a better understanding of the present invention and for its embodiment but in no way limit the scope of the invention itself.<br>
The bromine index is measured according to ASTM D 1491, the Acid Wash Colour according to ASTM D 848-62. EXAMPLE 1<br>

The reaction mass has a residence time in the reactor of 60 minutes, at a temperature of 50*’C and a pressure of 4 Kg/cm’. At the outlet of the reactor, the mixture is sent to a separator where the upper organic part and that consisting of the acid are continuously removed. The level is regulated in this container so as to obtain an average residence time of 1.5 hours.<br>

CLAIMS<br>
1. A process for the production of linear alkyl aroma-tic hydrocarbons, containing from 10 to 14 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain, comprising the following operating cycle:<br>
(a)	dehydrogenating   n-para f ins to the corresponding n-olefins in a dehydrogenation reactor obtaining a mixture also comprising diolefins and aromatic by-products as well as light cracking products and hydrogen;<br>
(b)	selectively hydrogenating the diolefins formed during step (a) into mono-olefins, obtaining a mixture essentially consisting of mono-olefins and n-paraffins, in addition to the aromatic by-products formed in step (a);<br>
(c)	feeding the stream coming from step (b) , together with a stream consisting of an aromatic hydrocarbon, to an alkylation unit in which an alkylation catalyst is present;<br>
(d)	feeding the alkylation product to a distillation section for the recovery of the excess aromatic hydrocarbon, a paraffin stream essentially consisting of   n-paraffins and aromatic by-products, and the alkylated aromatic product, respectively;<br><br>
(e)	subjecting the paraffinic stream to a hydro-gelation step to transform the aromatic byproducts into cycloparaffins;<br>
(f)	recycling the stream coming from step (e) to the dehydrogenation unit of step (a).<br>
The process according to claim 1, wherein the dehydrogenation reaction of the n-paraffins is carried out in the presence of a catalyst comprising a noble metal supported on porous material. The process according to claim 2, wherein the catalyst comprises an element of the platinum group in a ratio of 0.01-H2% by weight, with respect to the total, an alkaline or earth-alkaline metal in a ratio of 0. l-r5% by weight, and optionally a constituent selected from one or more of the following metals:<br>
tin: from 0.1 to 1% by weights-indium: from 0.1 to 1% by weight; tallium: from 0.1 to 1% by weight. The process according to claims 2 or 3,, wherein, in the case of the contemporary presence of indium and tallium, these are present in such quantities that the ratio In/Tl is a 0.3 whereas the ratio Pt/In + Tl is a 1.5. The process according to any of the previous<br><br>
claims, wherein the dehydrogenation reaction takes place in the presence of hydrogen, with a molar ratio hydrogen/n-paraffins ranging from 0.5 to 20. The process according to any of the previous claims, wherein step (b) for the selective hydro-gelation of diolefins is carried out on a fixed-bed catalyst based on nickel supported on alumina, partially poisoned, or on a catalyst based on noble metals supported on carbon, with a molar ratio hydrogen/n-paraffins with a ratio H2/diolef-ins higher than 1.<br>
The process according to any of the previous claims, wherein the alkylation reaction is carried out in the presence of a catalyst selected from HF, AICI3, or from solid catalysts of an acidic nature (heterogeneous).<br>
The process according to claim 1, wherein the catalyst is used in quantities ranging from 0.05% to 10% in moles with respect to the olefin whereas the molar ratio aromatic hydrocarbon/olefin is between 1 and 20.<br>
The process according to any of the previous claims, wherein the hydrogenation step (e) takes place with a fixed-bed catalyst selected from metal of group VIII and IVA, of the periodic<br><br>
table, supported on inorganic inert materials such as alumina, silica, or their mixtures, clays, zeolites, synthetic or natural, in the physical form of cylinders, spherules, extruded products. 5 10. The process according to any of the previous claims, wherein the charges   n-paraffins are introduced into the cycle before step (e) .<br><br></td>
