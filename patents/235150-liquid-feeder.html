3.   PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the<br>
invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br><br>
QUID FEEDER<br>
The entire disclosure of Japanese Patent Application No. 2004-070090 filed on March 12, 2004, including specification, claims, drawings and summary is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a liquid feeder for feeding liquid, such as ink or varnish, to a sheet held on an impression cylinder so as to perform, for example, printing or coating on the sheet. More particularly, the invention relates to a liquid feeder for use in a screen printing unit of a screen printing machine for performing screen printing on sheets.<br>
Description of the Related Art:<br>
A conventional screen printing machine employs a rotary screen. The rotary screen includes a hollow cylinder rotatably supported and formed as follows: a thin screen (made of, for example, stainless steel or nickel) in which small holes are etched in image patterns is formed into a cylindrical shape. In the interior of the hollow cylinder are provided an ink fountain fixedly supported by a frame,and a squeegee. The squeegee pushes out ink through the small holes of the hollow cylinder, thereby printing the image patterns on sheets. In View of its capability of thick-application printing in special ink or the like, rotary screen printing is employed for imparting high quality to, for example, appearance and tactile impression.<br>
When printing is performed on sheets by use of such a rotary screen, the following problem is potentially involved. Since a sheet is held on an impression cylinder, which is in contact with the rotary screen, by means of a gripper, projection of the gripper from the outer circumferential surface of the impression cylinder may cause damage to the rotary screen.<br>
In order to cope with the above problem, Japanese Kohyo(PCT) Patent Publication No. 2000-504643 discloses the following technique. A gripper and a gripper pad aredisposed in the interior of a notch of an impression cylinder from the outer circumferential surface of the impression cylinder.An openable and closable cover is provided for covering the notch. When a sheet is to be gripped or released, the cover is opened or closed synchronously with gripping or un gripping of the gripper, thereby allowing gripping or releasing of the sheet and preventing damage to the rotary screen, which could otherwise result from protrusion of the rotary screen into the notch of the impression cylinder or contact between the rotary screen and a projecting object (gripper).<br>
In order to cope with the above problem, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (kokai) No. 2001-225445 discloses the following technique. In place of the gripper and the gripper pad, a suction head is provided in the interior of the notch of the impression cylinder. A portion of the notch other than that where the suction head is provided is covered with a cover. When a sheet is to be held, the suction head is activated to suction-hold the sheet. When a sheet is to be released, the suction head is deactivated to release the sheet. In this manner, a sheet is held or released, and there is prevented<br>
2<br><br>
damage to the rotary screen, which could otherwise result from protrusion of the rotary screen into le notch of the impression cylinder or contact between the rotary screen and a projecting object.<br>
However, the impression cylinder described in Japanese Kohyo (PCT) Patent Publication No. 2000-504643 is rotated while the cover that covers the entire notch undergoes opening and closing. Accordingly, when the notch is covered with the cover, high-speed rotation of the impression cylinder may cause vibration of the cover, resulting in a failure to align the cover with the outer circumferential surface of the impression cylinder. Therefore, application of the disclosed technique to high-speed printing is difficult. Also, the vibrating cover may come into contact with the hollow cylinder of the rotary screen, causing damage to the rotary screen.<br>
In the impression cylinder described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (kokai) No. 2001-225445, the suction mechanism for suction-holding a sheet becomes complex, resulting in increased cost .Also, when a sheet is transferred to the suction mechanism from an upstream cylinder, deformation (undulation) of the sheet in the sheet width direction may cause failure of the suction mechanism to suction-hold the sheet.<br>
Occurrence of such a problem is not limited to the case where thick-application printing is performed on sheets in special ink or the like by use of the rotary screen. Such a problem may also arise in the case where liquid is fed from a liquid-feeding cylinder to a sheet held on the impression cylinder, as in the case of application of varnish to a sheet by use of the rotary screen .<br>

downstream end portion and a rotationally upstream end portion of the notch 100a, thereby bstantially establishing circumferential continuity of the outer circumferential surface of the impression cylinder 100. The gap guards 105 and the gripper pads 101 differ in position with Yi respect to the axial direction of the impression cylinder 100.<br>
As viewed in the axial direction of the impression cylinder 100 (FIG. 3), the guide surface 105a of each of the gap guards 105 has the following configuration: a clearance CI is present between the guide surface 105a and the outer circumferential surface of the impression cylinder 100 at a rotationally upstream end portion of the notch 100a; a clearance C2 is present between the guide surface 105a and the gripper pad 101 at the rotationally upstream end portion of the notch 100a; and the guide surface 105a is flush, in a continuous manner, with the outer circumferential surface of the impression cylinder 100 at a rotationally downstream end portion of the notch 100a.<br>
Furthermore, the position and geometry of the guide surface 105a of each of the gap guards 105 are selected so as to establish the following conditions: as viewed in the axial direction of the impression cylinder 100 (FIG. 3), a rotationally upstream portion of the guide surface 105a overlaps with the guide surface 104a of each of the grippers 104 over a lap region LI, and a rotationally downstream portion of the guide surface 105a coincides with the outer circumferential surface of the impression cylinder 100 over a lap region L2.<br>
In FIG. 4, reference numeral 106 denotes a cam follower for rotating the gripper shaft 102. In the present embodiment, the gripper pads 101, the gripper shaft 102, the gripper holders 103, the grippers 104, and other relevant components constitute a gripper device.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 1 to 3, a rotary screen 27, which serves as a liquid-feeding cylinder, is in contact with the impression cylinder 100 of the screen printing unit 20e at a position located rotationally downstream of the transfer cylinder 26d. The rotary screen 27 includes a hollow cylinder 27a, an ink fountain 27b provided in the interior of the hollow cylinder 27a, and a squeegee 27c. The hollow cylinder 27a is rotatably supported and formed as follows: a thin screen (made of, for example, stainless steel or nickel) in which small holes are etched in image patterns is formed into a cylindrical shape.<br>
The rotary screen 27 can perform printing as follows: while the hollow cylinder 27a is rotated synchronously with rotation of the impression cylinder 100, the squeegee 27c pushes out liquid, such as special ink, contained in the ink fountain 27b, through the small holes of the hollow cylindc ;• 27a, thereby printing image patterns corresponding to the small holes on the sheet 1 held on the impression cylinder 100.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, a transfer cylinder 26e is in contact with the impression cylinder 100 of the screen printing unit 20e at a position located rotationally downstream of the rotary screen 27. A transport cylinder 28 of a drying unit 20f is in contact with the transfer cylinder 26e at a position located rotationally downstream of the impression cylinder 100. A drying lamp 29 for irradiating ultraviolet rays (UV) is disposed in the vicinity of the transport cylinder 28 at a position located rotationally downstream of the transfer cylinder 26e.<br>
8<br><br>
A delivery cylinder 31 of a delivery unit 30 is in contact with the transport cylinder 28 of the drying lit 20f at a position located rotationally downstream of the drying lamp 29. A sprocket 32 is coaxially provided on the delivery cylinder 31 in a unitarily rotatable condition. A delivery platform 35 is provided in the delivery unit 30. A sprocket 33 is provided above the delivery platform 35. A delivery chain 34 is looped around and extends between the sprockets 32 and 33. A plurality of unillustrated delivery grippers are attached, at predetermined intervals, to the delivery chain 34.<br>
Next will be described operation of the thus-configured printing machine in which the liquid feeder according to the present embodiment is employed.<br>
The sheets 1 are fed one by one from the feed platform 11 of the feeder 10 onto the feeder board 12. While the swing arm shaft pregripper 13 transfers each of the sheets 1 from the feeder board 12 to the impression cylinder 21a of the first offset printing nit 20a of the printing section 20, the ink feeder 24a and dampener 25a of the first offset printing unit 20a feed ink and dampening water, respectively, to the plate cylinder 23a. When ink is transferred from the plate cylinder 23a to the rubber cylinder 22a, the ink is transferred from the rubber cylinder 22a to the sheet 1; i.e., the sheet 1 undergoes printing in the first color. Then, the sheet 1 is transferred, via the transfer cylinder 26a, to the impression cylinder 21b of the second offset printing unit 20b. Similarly to the case of the first offset printing unit 20a, the sheet 1 undergoes printing in the second color in the second off st.; printing unit 20b. Similarly, the sheet 1 undergoes printing in the third and fourth colors in the third and fourth offset printing units 20c and 20d, respectively. Then, the sheet 1 undergoes gripping change, via the transfer cylinder 26d, to gripping by the gripper pads 101 and grippers 104 of the impression cylinder 100 of the screen printing unit 20e. The sheet 1 undergoes thick application printing in special ink or the like, which is effected in the previously described manner by the rotary screen 27 of the screen printing unit 20e.<br>
When the sheet 1 is gripped by means of the grippers 104 and the corresponding gripper pads 101, the guide surfaces 104a of the grippers 104 are flush, in a substantially continuous manner, with the outer circumferential surface of the impression cylinder 100 at the rotationally upstream portion of the notch 100a of the impression cylinder 100. Also, the guide surfaces 105a of the gap guards 105 extend along the outer circumferential surface of the impression cylinder 100 in such a manner as to establish circumferential continuity between the guide surfaces 104a of the grippers 104 and the rotationally downstream end of the notch 100a of the impression cylinder 100. Accordingly, even when the rotary screen 27 comes into contact with the grippers 104, the rotary screen 27 is free from damage. Also, the rotary screen 27 does not protrude into the notch 100a. In other words, when the notch 100a comes under the rotary screen 27, the guide surfaces 104a of the grippers 104 and the guide surfaces 105a of the gap guards 105 guide the rotary screen 27 in the same manner as does the outer circumferential surface of the impression cylinder 100.<br>
As mentioned previously, at a rotationally upstream end portion of the notch 100a, the clearances CI and C2 are present respectively between the guide surfaces 105a of the gap guards 105 and the outer circumferential surface of the impression cylinder 100 and between the guide surfaces 105a of the gap guards 105 and the gripper pads 101. Accordingly, when the sheet 1 is gripped between the grippers 104 and the corresponding gripper pads 101, the gripped edge (leading edge) of the sheet 1<br>
9<br><br>
does not interfere with the gap guards 105, thereby preventing damage to the sheet 1.<br>
Furthermore, as viewed in the axial direction of the impression cylinder 100, a rotationally upstream portion of the guide surface 105a of each of the gap guards 105 overlaps with the guide surface 104a of each of the grippers 104 over the lap region LI, and a rotationally downstream portion of the guide surface 105a coincides with the outer circumferential surface of the impression cylinder 100 over the lap region L2. Accordingly, when the rotary screen 27 moves from the guide surfaces 104a of the grippers 104 to the guide surfaces 105a of the gap guards 105, or from the guide surfaces 105a of the gap guards 105 to the outer circumferential surface of the impression cylinder 100, the rotary screen 27 can be reliably free from even a slight protrusion into the notch 100a.<br>
After undergoing thick-application printing in special ink or the like which is effected by the rotary screen 27, the sheet 1 is transferred, via the transfer cylinder 26e, from the impression cylinder 100 to the transport cylinder 28 of the drying unit 20f. Through irradiation with UV from the drying lamp 29, the printed special ink or the like is dried. Subsequently, the sheet 1 is transferred to the delivery cylinder 31 of the delivery unit 30 and is then transported on the moving delivery chain 3 i while being gripped by the delivery grippers. Then, the sheet 1 is delivered onto the delivery platform 35.<br>
As described above, the liquid feeder of the present embodiment has the following structural features. The gap guards 105 are fixedly attached to the notch 100a of the impression cylinder 100 in such a manner as to allow the grippers 104 to project from inside the notch 100a, and have the respective guide surfaces 105a, as parts of their outer surfaces. The guide surfaces 105a extend between a first end portion and a second end portion of the notch 100a with respect to the circumferential direction of the impression cylinder 100 and have a curvature substantially equal to that of the outer circumferential surface of the impression cylinder 100. The guide surfaces 105a are flush, in a continuous manner, with the outer circumferential surface of the impression cylinder 100 at the circumferentially second end portion of the notch 100a, whereas a clearance is formed between the guide surfaces 105a and the outer circumferential surface of the impression cylinder 100 at the circumferentially first end portion of the notch 100a. Also, each of the grippers 104 has the guide surface 104a as a part of its outer surface. The guide surfaces 104a have a curvature substantially equal to that of the outer circumferential surface of the impression cylinder 100 in such a manner that the guide surfaces 104a are flush, in a continuous manner, with the outer circumferential surface of the impression cylinder 100 at the circumferentially first end portion of the notch 100a. Furthermore, the guide surfaces 105a of the gap guards 105 and the guide surfaces 104a of the grippers 104 overlap each other with respect to the axial direction of the impression cylinder 100. The guide surfaces 105a of the gap guards 105 and the outer circumferential surfaces of the impression cylinder 100 overlap each other with respect to the axial direction of the impression cylinder 100.<br>
Thus, even during high-speed printing, the liquid feeder according to the present embodiment can prevent, by means of a simple structure, collision between the grippers 104 and the rotary screen 27 and protrusion of the rotary screen 27 into the notch 100a without inducing vibration of the impression cylinder 100 of the screen printing unit 20e.<br>
10<br><br>
Accordingly, the liquid feeder according to the present embodiment can feed special ink or the like:, a favorable condition, from the rotary screen 27 to the sheet 1 held on the impression cylinder 100 rotating even at high speed, so that even high-speed printing in special ink or the like can be performed in a favorable condition at low cost.<br>
At a rotationally upstream end portion of the notch 100a, the clearances CI and C2 are present respectively between the guide surfaces 105a of the gap guards 105 and the outer circumferential surface of the impression cylinder 100 and between the guide surfaces 105a of the gap guards 105 and the gripper pads 101. Accordingly, when the sheet 1 is gripped between the grippers 104 and the corresponding gripper pads 101, the gripped edge (leading edge) of the sheet 1 can be prevented from colliding with the gap guards 105, thereby greatly reducing wasted paper. As viewed in the axial direction of the impression cylinder 100, a rotationally upstream portion of the guide surface 105a of each of the gap guards 105 overlaps with the guide surface 104a of each of the grippers 104 over the lap region LI, and a rotationally downstream portion of the guide surface 105a coincides with the outer circumferential surface of the impression cylinder 100 over the lap region L2. Accordingly, when the rotary screen 27 moves from the guide surfaces 104a of the grippers 104 to the guide surfaces 105a of the gap guards 105, or from the guide surfaces 105a of the gap guards 105 to the outer circumferential surface of the impression cylinder 100, the rotary screen 27 can be free from even a slight protrusion into the notch 100a. Therefore, damage to the rotary screen 27 can be prevented more reliably.<br><other embodiments><br>
According to the first embodiment, a plurality of the bar-like gap guards 105 are provided at predetermined intervals along the axial direction of the impression cylinder 100 in such a manner as to allow the grippers 104 to project from inside the notch 100a of the impression cylinder 100. In another embodiment of the present invention, as shown in FIG. 5, a plate-like gap guard 205 is fixedly attached to the notch 100a of the impression cylinder 100 in such a manner as to cover the notch 100a. The gap guard 205 has a guide surface 205a in which cutouts 205b are formed for allowing the corresponding grippers 104 to project from inside the notch 100a of the impression cylinder 100. Still another embodiment of the present invention includes an auxiliary gap guard 105 provided at a position where the gripper 101 is not present in the vicinity thereof, and a contact member 107 provided on the outer circumferential surface of the rotary screen 27. As shown in FIG. 6, as viewed in the axial direction of the impression cylinder 100, the auxiliary gap guard 105 is provided in such a manner that its outer surface is flush, in a continuous manner, with the outer circumferential surface of the impression cylinder 100 at a rotationally upstream end portion of the notch 100a of the impression cylinder 100.<br>
The auxiliary gap guard 105 has a relief groove 105b having a relief surface and formed at a rotationally upstream end portion of its outer surface. The relief surface corresponds to the upper end surface of the gripper pad 101; specifically, the relief surface is descendingly inclined in the rotational direction of the impression cylinder 100. The contact member 107 is formed in such a manner as to fit into the relief groove 105b while damage to the leading edge of the sheet 1 is prevented, protrusion of the rotary screen 27 into the notch 100a can be prevented by means of a simple structure . In this case, when the contact member 107 assumes such a shape as to come into close contact with the relief surface of the relief groove 105b of the auxiliary gap guard 105, the<br>
11<br><br>
auxiliary gap guard 105 and the contact member 107 can prevent deformation of he hollow linder 27a of the rotary screen 27. A further embodiment of the present invention includes a relief member 108 provided in the notch 100a of the impression cylinder 100 at a position where the gripper pad 101 and the gap guard 105 are absent, and a contact member 109 provided on the outer circumferential surface of the rotary screen 27 and corresponding to the relief member 108. As shown in FIG. 7, the relief member 108 is located at a rotationally upstream end portion of the notch 100a. The relief member 108 is substantially identical in shape with the gripper pad 101 and has a relief surface. Accordingly, damage to the leading edge of the sheet 1 can be prevented moiv: reliably. In this case, when the contact member 109 assumes such a shape as to come into close contact with the relief surface of the relief member 108, the relief member 108 and the contact member 109 can prevent deformation of the hollow cylinder 27a of the rotary screen 27. The above embodiments are described while mentioning the screen printing unit 20e and the drying unit 20f which are disposed downstream of the first to fourth offset printing units 20a to 20d. However, the present invention is not limited thereto. For example, as shown in FIG. 8, the screen printing unit 20e and the drying unit 20f may be disposed upstream of the first to fourth offset printing units 20a to 20d. Alternatively, as shown in FIG. 9, the screen printing unit 20e and the drying unit 20f may be disposed between the first and second offset printing units 20a and 20b and the third and fourth offset printing units 20c and 20d. The above embodiments are described while mentioning application to the printing machine in which the offset printing units 20a to 20d and the screen printing unit 20e are combined. However, the present invention is not limited thereto. For example, as shown in FIG. 10, the liquid feeder of the present invention may be applied to a printing machine that includes the feeder 10, the screen printing unit 20e, the drying unit 20f, and the delivery unit 30 without employment of the offset printing units. Alternatively, the liquid feeder of the present invention may be used in combination with a machining unit other than a printing unit; for example, a rotary blanking unit. The above embodiments are described while mentioning thick-application printing that is performed in such a manner 27b of the rotary screen 27 of the screen printing unit 20e. However, the present invention is not limited thereto. For example, the liquid feeder of the present invention may be applied to any case where liquid is fed from the iquid feeding cylinder to a sheet held on the impression cylinder, such as application to a coating apparatus for applying, to a sheet, varnish contained in the ink fountain of the rotary screen.<br>
