Figure 3 (a) to 3 (b): Shows the embodiments of the invention in which both ends of the conductive path of the tamper evident secured seal are visible on first section.<br>
Figure 4 (a) to 4 (b): Shows the embodiments of the invention in which both ends of conductive path of the tamper evident secured seal are visible on third section.<br>
Detailed description of the Invention:<br>
The above, and the other objects, features &amp; advantages of invention will become apparent from following description read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
5<br><br>
Meanings of the reference numerals used in the figures are as follow:<br>
1	- Tamper evident secured seal according to present invention.<br>
2	- polyvinyl copolymer sheet<br>
3	- electrically conductive path<br>
4	- One end of electrically conductive path<br>
5	- another end of electrically conductive path<br>
6	- hologram<br>
7	- barcode and numbering<br>
8	- manufacture's identification<br>
9	- safety instructions<br><br>
S1- first section of the polyvinyl copolymer sheet<br>
S2- middle section of the polyvinyl copolymer sheet<br>
S3- third section of the polyvinyl copolymer sheet<br>
Now referring to figure 1 the tamper proof secured seal (1) of the present invention is shown. It comprises a polyvinyl copolymer sheet (2) with adhesive coating. The adhesive coating is of solvent free synthetic rubber based pressure sensitive adhesive. The reason of selecting polyvinyl copolymer material with coating for making the seal is to make the seal waterproof and non-tearable. This sheet (2) is divided in to three sections (S1, S2, S3). The first section (S1) bears a manufactures identification (8) along with bar code (7) containing certain information, middle section (S2) accommodates the hologram (6) over it and third section (S3) bears the safety instructions (9). The bar code can contain any information like serial number of product, company's code number etc. safety instruction may any printed warning regarding non tampering of the seal.<br>
The tamper proof secured seal (1) of the present invention further includes an open looped electrically conductive path (3). This conductive path (3) is used for detecting the tampering of the seal (1). This conductive path (3) consists of two ends (4, 5). The conductive path (3) is placed on the polyvinyl copolymer sheet (2). The conductive path (3) is placed in such way that both ends (4, 5) of an open looped electrically conductive path (3) are visible on either first section (S1) and/or third section (S3) of said polyvinyl copolymer sheet. If somebody tries to tamper the seal (1) at the middle section (S2), same can be easily detectable just by<br>
6<br><br>
checking the electrical conductivity across the both ends (4, 5) of the conductive path (3). If the conductivity is there between both ends (4, 5) that means seal (1) is ok and if conductivity is not found between both ends (4, 5) that means seal (1) is tampered.<br>
Seal (1) also consist of a hologram (6). The hologram (6) is placed in the middle section of the polyvinyl copolymer sheet (2). The hologram (6) is placed over the middle section of the polyvinyl copolymer sheet (2) in such way that the conductive path (3) is in between the hologram (6) and polyvinyl copolymer sheet (2). The portion of the conductive path (3) which is under the hologram (6) is not visible.<br>
The main purpose of using hologram (6) is to provide the high level of the security. Also following advantages are provided by the hologram:<br>
i.	It can not be optically scanned by computer<br>
ii.	It can not be reproduced with a photocopier.<br>
iii.	It minimizes the document tampering.<br>
iv.	It provides quick and easy optical validation.<br>
v.	Hologram can contain embedded and hidden images.<br>
Referring to figure 2 (a) to 2 (i) various embodiment of the invention in which one end of the conductive path of the tamper evident secured seal is visible on first section and other on third section are shown.<br>
Referring to figure 3 (a) to 3 (b) the embodiments of the invention in which both ends of the conductive path of the tamper evident secured seal are visible on first section are shown.<br>
Referring to figure 4 (a) to 4 (b) the embodiments of the invention in which both ends of conductive path of the tamper evident secured seal are visible on third section are shown.<br>
Now we will see how the tamperproof seal (1) of the present invention is manufactured. For this first a sheet (2) of a polyvinyl copolymer material is taken. Then this sheet is coated with the adhesive coat of solvent free synthetic rubber based pressure sensitive adhesive. The coating is done by roll to roll hot coating process. Thereafter sheet (2) is cut in a proper<br>
7<br><br>
dimension as per the need by guillotine machine. Then this sheet (2) is divided in three sections (S1, S2, S3) in which first section (S1) bears a manufactures identification (8) along with bar code (7) containing certain information, middle section (S2) for accommodating the hologram (6) over it and third section (S3) for bearing the safety instructions (9). Then an open looped electrically conductive path (3) is placed on polyvinyl copolymer sheet (2) by screen printing process. The conductive path (3) is placed in such way that both ends (4, 5) of the open looped electrically conductive path (3) are visible on either first section (S1) and/or third section (S3) of the polyvinyl copolymer sheet (2). The conductive path (3) is made up of conductive silver based ink. Then hologram (6) is laminated over middle section (S2) of the polyvinyl copolymer sheet (2) and finally bar coding and numbering is done on the first section (S1) of polyvinyl copolymer sheet (2).<br>
Industrial Applicability:<br>
The tamper evident secured seal are often used to detect tampering with the objects containing valuables, confidential information, or calibration/ equipment settings. Typical applications includes file cabinets, air craft hatches, entry doors, envelops, cartons, electronic components. More particularly it is used in energy meters i.e. electric meters provided by electricity board and electricity distribution companies.<br>
The present invention is not limited to the above described embodiments, and various alterations, modifications, and / or alternative applications of the invention may be possible, if desired, without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention which can be read from the claims and the entire specification. All these possible alterations, modifications, and / or alternative applications of the invention are also intended to be within technical scope of the present invention.<br>
