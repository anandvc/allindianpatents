				<td>PROCESS FOR PREPARING A PROTECTED 4-AMINOMETHYL-PYRROLIDIN-3-ONE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a novel process for preparing a protected 4-aminomethyl-pyrrolidin-3-one, novel intermediates produced during this process, and its use in the preparation of quinolone antibiotics.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Compounds of formula (1):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which P1 and P2 are protecting groups<br>
are useful as intermediates for preparing compounds of formula (2)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R is C1-4 alkyl or C1-4 haloalkyl, and salts therof e.g. the dihydrochloride salts;<br>
which are in turn useful as intermediates for preparing quinolone antibiotics, such as those disclosed in USP 5,633,262 and EP 688772A1. The intermediate of formula (2) in which R is methyl  is of particular<br>
use   in    the    production    of   the    compound    (R,S)-7-(3-aminomethyl-4-methoxylminopyrrolidin-l-yl)-l-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-4-oxo-l,4-dihydro-l,8-n aphthyridine-3-carboxylic   acid   and   salts   thereof,   especially   (R,S)-7-(3-aminomethyl-4-.syn-methoxyimino-pyrrolidin-1-yl)- l-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-4-o xo-l,4-dihydro-l,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic   acid   methanesulfonate   and hydrates thereof including the sesquihydrate disclosed in WO 98/42705.<br>
EP 688772A1 discloses a process for the production of a compound of formula (2) as depicted in Scheme 1:<br>
Scheme 1<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
in Scheme 1 Boc represents t-butoxycarbonyl, and has the same meaning throughout the present specification.<br>
There are however several drawbacks with the process of scheme 1, particularly if it. is to be used on a tens to hundreds of kilogramme scale for commercial production, these include:<br>
a)	The  process is somewhat inefficient since the use of a reducing<br>
agents, such  as,  platinum  under hydrogen atmosphere,  palladium metal, lithium   aluminum   hydride(LAH),   lithium   borohydride(LiBH4),   sodium<br>
borohydride(NaBH4), or NaBH4-trifluoroacetic acid complex, etc., reduces both the ketone and cyano groups, requiring reoxidation of the alcohol to regenerate the ketone.<br>
b)	Reducing agents other than NaBH4-trifluoroacetic acid complex do not completely reduce the cyano group, resulting in the production of several side products and thus a reduction in yield and purity. Although the use of NaBH4-trifluoroacetic acid complex as a reducing agent may improve the yield and purity of the product, its use results in the discontinuous generation of hydrogen gas. Therefore, explosion risk cannot be adequately prevented by simple exhaust-incineration equipment, and it is not easy to apply this reduction process to production on a large scale. In addition, since the process for preparing the complex itself has many problems, such as formation of side products, etc., it is inappropriate for use on a large scale.<br>
c)	Side reactions which are not observed in small scale production â€¢ occur more frequently in a large  scale production which leads to a reduction in yield. The undesired side products, some of which are not clearly identified, make the separation and/or purification of the desired product difficult. Side products which have been identified include the compound of formulae (3) and (4):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
It is assumed that the side products (3) and (4) are produced by reactions of the starting 4-cyano-l-(N-t-butoxy-carbonyl)pyrrolidin-3-one with sodium borohydride and trifluoroaceric acid. The by-product of formula (3) is particularly troublesome as it is not easily removed by recrystallization.<br>
d)	The pyridine-sulfur trioxide complex used during the oxidation of the hydroxy group is expensive, making it unsuitable for use on an industrial or commercial scale. In addition, the dimethytsulfide formed as a side product during the oxidation is not environmentally acceptable,<br>
e)	When a transition metal catalyst such as platinum is used in hydrogenation reaction, the reaction does not well proceeded using a catalytic amount of platinum and a low pressure of hydrogen, and thus cannot be used commercially.<br>
Thus, it is desirable to find an alternative process for the production of the compounds of formulae (1) and (2), particularly one in which an a -cyanoketone derivative can be selectively reduced in such a way that the subsequent reoxidation of the hydroxy group is not required.<br>
The present invention is based on the finding that the cyano group of an a-cyanoketone derivative can be selectively reduced to effectively produce the compound of formula (1) using Raney-nickel under hydrogen as reducing agent. The reaction conditions used in this process are very mild and thus can be used for industrial production. The use of a Raney-nickel catalyst gives several advantages over the prior art process described above, for example it does not require the additional oxidation reaction, also, the formation of side products markedly decreases compared with the process using NaBH4 as a reducing agent, which leads to a stoichiometric reaction and a good yield.<br>
DISCLOSUE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The    present   invention    provides   a   process    for   preparing    a compound of formula (1):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which P1   and P2 are protecting groups; comprising<br>
a)	reaction of a compound of formula (5):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein P1 is defined for formula (1); with a Raney-nickel catalyst in a solvent under hydrogen to produce a compound of formula (6):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein P1 is defined for formula (1);<br>
b)	protecting the ammo group to produce a compound of formula (7):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein P1 and P2 are defined for formula (1); and<br>
c)     selective reduction of the double bond to produce the compound of formula (1).<br>
The present invention also provides the novel intermediates of formulae (6) and (7).<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The process of the invention is summarized in Scheme 2: Scheme 2<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
The above process is more specifically explained hereinafter.<br>
In step a) - reduction of the cyano group, the solvent is<br>
preferably an alcohol or ether, e.g. methanol or isopropanol, which have<br>
been found to improve the reaction rate. However, suitable solvents are<br>
not restricted to alcohols and ethers, and various inert solvents which do<br>
not adversely affect the reaction can be used providing the hydrogen<br>
pressure is controlled, The solvent may be used in an amount of 2 to<br>
20 times by volume, preferably 2 to 5 times by volume with respect to<br>
the   compound   of   formula   (5).	The   reaction   is   advantageously<br>
conducted in the presence of one or more additives selected from the group consisting  of ammonia  water  gaseous  ammonia  and  acetic  acid,<br>
etc.    These additives may be used in an amount of 2 molar equivalents or   more,   preferably   2   to   4   molar   equivalents   with   respect   to   the compound of formula (5).    The use of these additives has been shown to improve tire purity of the resulting compounds of formula (6).<br>
The step a) reaction is suitably carried out under hydrogen pressures ranging from atmospheric to about 50 atms, preferably from 4 to 10 atms, and suitably at temperatures ranging from room temperature to 60oC. Various types of Raney-nickels can be used as the catalyst in this reduction reaction, however, Raney-nickel of W-2 type or a similar type thereof is preferably used.<br>
In step b) - protection of the amino group, any suitable amino protecting group may be used. The protecting group is preferably removable under acidic conditions. Examples of protecting groups include formyl, acetyl, trilluoroacetyl, benzoyl, para-toluenesulfonyl, methoxycarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl, t-buthoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, para-methoxybenzyl, trityl, tetrahydropyranyl and pivaloyl. Particular protecting groups that may be mentioned include acetyl t-buthoxycarbonyl, and pivaloyl. The preferred protecting group for both P1 and P2 is t-buthoxycarbonyl. Protection of the amino group may be achieved using conditions familiar to those skilled in the art. For example by reaction of the compound of formyla (6) with a suitable base, e.g. selected from the group consisting of lithium t-butoxide, lithium isopropoxide.. potassium t-butoxide, sodium t-butoxide, and lithium chloride, sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide. The base is suitably used in an amount of 2.0 molar equivalents or more, preferably 2.0- to 4.0 molar equivalents with respect to the compound of formula (6). Any solvents conventionally used in organic reactions, such as for example, tetrahydrofuran, toluene, dioxane, dimethoxyethane, etc. may be used, suitably in an amount of 5 to 20 times by volume with respect to<br>
the compound of formula (6). It is desirable to carry out the reaction at temperatures ranging from -40 to 10oC The reagent for introducing an amino-protecting group may be selected from the group consisting of, for example, di(t-butoxy)dicarbonate, pivaloyl chloride and acetyl chloride, preferably in an amount of 0.9 to 1.5 molar equivalents with respect to the compound of formula (6). The resulting compound of formula (7) may be purified by recrystallization, for example, from a solvent mixture of alcohol and water e.g.  1:1 to 3:1 by volume.<br>
In step c) - reduction of the double bond, the selective reduction is preferably carried out using a metal catalyst, e.g. a transition metal catalyst, such as Raney-nickel, palladium-carbon or Lindiar's catalyst, e.g. in an amount of 0,5 to 20% by weight, preferably 0.5 to 5% by weight with respect to the compound of formula (7), under hydrogen e.g. at a pressure from .1. to 3 atms. It is desirable to maintain the pH of the reaction solution at 3 to 5 or 8 to 10 using an organic amine or buffer solution in order to selectively reduce the double bond at 4-position of the pyrrolidine ring without reducing the oxo group at 3-position with respect to the hydroxy group. Organic amines which can be used include tertiary alkyiamines such as triethylamine, tri(n-butyl)amine, diisopropylethylamine, etc., aromatic amines such as pyridine, 4-dimemylaminopyndine, 4-(4-methylpiperidm- l-yl)-pyridine, imidazole, quinoline, isoquinoline, etc.; anilines such as dimethylamline, etc.; and chiral amines such as triethanolamine, quinine, quinidine, etc. The amine is suitably used in an amount of 0.01 to 10 molar equivalents, preferably 1 to 10 molar equivalents with respect to the starting compound of formula (7), The amines can be used alone or as mixtures in various ratios. Any conventionally used ternary amines in organic reactions can be used for the present reaction although they are not specifically listed above.    ,<br>
Any organic solvents, preferably one or more selected from the group consisting of alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, etc., ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, etc.; ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, etc.; esters such as ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, etc. can be used. The auxiliary agents including the organic amine, etc. are selected appropriately depending on the solvent used. The solvent is suitably used in an amount of 5 to 100 limes by volume, preferably 5 to 20 times by volume with respect to the compound of formula (7).<br>
When a buffer solution is used instead of the organic amines for adjusting the pH of the reaction solution, only the solvents which do not suddenly precipitate -the inorganic salt during' the mixing step can be used, examples of which are retrahydrofuran, dioxane, acetone, methanol, ethanol, etc. Tetrahydrofuran is most preferred. Solvents which are not miscible with aqueous solutions, such as ethyl acetate and diethylether, can also be used in this reaction. Any buffer solution which can adjust the pH of the reaction solution at 3 to 5 or 8 to 10 can be used, examples of which are phosphates, acetates, borates, etc. Acetate and borate buffer solution are the most preferred.<br>
The step c) reaction is suitably carried out at temperatures ranging from 0 to 50 Â°C, preferably 5 to 40 oC.<br>
