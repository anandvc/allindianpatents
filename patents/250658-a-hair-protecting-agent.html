				<td>BODY SURFACE PROTECTING COMPOSITION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to a composition that is used in applications to <br>
prevent or reduce disorders on a body surface (skin, hair, and the like), specifically <br>
relates to a body surface protecting composition. In particular, the present invention<br>
relates to a body surface protecting composition which has the excellent effects of<br>
accelerating the recovery of the barrier functions of skin and hair, and preventing<br>
degradation of those functions.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002] Skin barrier functions include a function that prevent invasion by foreign<br>
matter from outside the skin into a body, and a function that prevents water content in<br>
the body from escaping to the outside. When the barrier function of the skin is<br>
degraded, rough skin or inflammation of the skin such as rash can result from<br>
external stimulation, and dry chapped skin can result from an increase in the<br>
transpiration of water from the skin, and therefore itchiness and skin trouble can<br>
easily occur. Furthermore, the barrier function of the hair is primarily a function of<br>
preventing water and aqueous components from escaping to the outside. When the<br>
barrier function of the hair is reduced, the tensile strength and viscoelasticity of the<br>
hair will be degraded, the feel on the skin will be poor, hair styling will be difficult, and<br>
not only will this induce a deterioration in appearance such as luster, but will also<br>
cause damage such as split ends and broken hair.<br>
[0003] Conventionally moisturizing agents have been added to cosmetic materials<br>
in order to improve and prevent this type of dry condition in skin and hair. For<br>
example, patent document 1 discloses a cosmetic material for skin that contains a<br>
polyol such as glycerin or ethylene glycol, or urea, hyaluronic acid or an amino acid<br>
or the like as a moisturizing agent. However, with these cosmetic materials, the<br>
effect is temporary and is insufficient for resolving the aforementioned problems.<br>
Furthermore, this cosmetic material is not used for applications to reduce and prevent<br>
damage to the surface of the body, and there is no comment whatsoever concerning<br>
an effect of accelerating improvements in the barrier function of the skin or preventing<br>
a degradation in that function. Furthermore, according to recent dermatological<br>
research, simple application of a moisturizing agent onto the surface of skin will<br>
increase the moisture of the skin for a short period of time, but in actuality may hinder<br>
the intrinsic function of the skin to retain moisture in the skin, and is known to<br>
damage the condition of the skin.<br>
[0004] Furthermore, patent document 2 for instance discloses a composition<br>
comprising an anionic surfactant with two chains and two hydrophilic groups, and<br>
discloses the use as a cosmetic material with moisturizing effects. However, this<br>
composition is also not used for applications to reduce and prevent damage to the<br>
surface of the body, and it dose not disclose any effect of accelerating improvements<br>
in the barrier function of the skin or preventing any degradation in that function, and<br>
does not disclose a compound that has those effects.<br>
[0005] Furthermore, patent document 3 discloses a moisture retaining composition<br>
which does not feel sticky by the combined use of a double chain amide compound<br>
with a polyhydric alcohol. However, this moisture retaining material is essentially a<br>
polyhydric alcohol, and similar to patent document 1, is not used for applications to<br>
reduce and prevent damage to the surface of the body, and it does not disclose any<br>
effect of accelerating improvements in the barrier function of the skin or preventing a<br>
degradation in net function, and only discloses the fact that a double chain amide<br>
compound works to reduce the stickiness when the composition is applied.<br>
[0006] Patent document 4 discloses a composition with low irritability that contains<br>
an anionic surfactant with a double chain bipolar acyl group, but it only disclose the<br>
low irritability of the composition, and dose not disclose any application for preventing<br>
or reducing damage to the surface of the body, nor any effect of proactively<br>
accelerating an improvement of the skin barrier function or preventing a degradation<br>
of that function.<br>
[0007] Patent document 5 discloses an agent to improve skin damage and metabolic<br>
disorders using a Gemini type surfactant, but the Gemini surfactant disclosed in this<br>
document is only a carrier for transporting physiologically active materials through<br>
skin or membrane, and does not show an effect of accelerating an improvement in<br>
the skin barrier function or preventing deterioration of that function.<br>
[0008] On the other hand, a type of sphingolipid such as ceramides obtained either<br>
naturally or synthetically are well-known as substances which improve the skin<br>
barrier function, and for example, patent document 6 discloses a liquid crystal<br>
composition using various types of ceramides, patent document 7 discloses an<br>
external medicine that contains ceramides or substances with a structure similar to a<br>
ceramide, and patent document 8 discloses a skin care agent that contains<br>
ceramides, and discloses a composition that improves skin turn over, improves skin<br>
roughness, and has excellent permeability and moisture retaining properties.<br>
However, all of the ceramides used in these inventions have low water solubility, and<br>
not only cause difficulty when creating a composition, but also require improvisations<br>
in order to permeate into the skin and hair, and cause restrictions on the degree of<br>
freedom of the formulation.<br>
[0009] Therefore there is demand for a raw material which has a strong effect at<br>
accelerating the recovery of the barrier function of skin and hair or in other words the<br>
surface of the body, and has good water solubility.<br>
[0010] On the other hand, in patent document 9, the present inventors have<br>
disclosed a surfactant consisting of a composition containing an acyl group<br>
comprising an N-long chain acyl acidic amino acid derivative made by reacting N-<br>
long chain acyl acidic amino acid anhydride with at least one compound selected<br>
from compounds which have m functional groups of at least one type selected from a<br>
group consisting of a hydroxyl group, an amino group, and a thiol group in the<br>
molecule, as well as a manufacturing method thereof. In this publication, the<br>
surfactant obtained provides surface activity at low concentrations and has been<br>
confirmed to have low irritability.<br>

DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
[0011] An object of the present invention is to provide a body surface protecting<br>
composition which has an excellent effect of accelerating recovery of the barrier<br>
function of skin and hair when that function has deteriorated due to skin trouble or the<br>
like.<br>
[0012] As a result of diligent investigations, the present inventors have discovered<br>
that a multi-chains and multiple hydrophilic group-type compound that has two or<br>
more hydrophobic groups and two or more hydrophilic groups in a molecule has an<br>
excellent effect of improving the barrier function of the skin and hair that is required<br>
because of skin trouble or the like.<br>
[0013] As described above, this multi-chain multiple hydrophilic group-type<br>
compound is known to be a surfactant, but the effect of improving the barrier function<br>
of skin and hair is entirely unknown.<br>
Furthermore, single chain single hydrophilic group-type compounds which have<br>
essentially the same basic constitutional units as multi-chain multiple hydrophilic<br>
group-type compounds can not provide the effect of accelerating recovery of the<br>
barrier function of skin, and conversely cause the barrier function to deteriorate.<br>
Therefore, it was unexpected that multi-chain multiple hydrophilic group-type<br>
compounds have the effect of improving the barrier function of skin and hair.<br>
[0014] Furthermore, the present inventors have discovered that the effect of<br>
improving the barrier function of skin and hair with the present invention is increased<br>
when the multi-chain multiple hydrophilic group-type compound forms a liquid crystal,<br>
and the liquid crystal formation is facilitated by combining a oil-based component with<br>
the multi-chain multiple hydrophilic group-type compound.<br>
[0015] In other words, the present invention is a body surface protecting composition<br>
comprising, (A) at least one type of multi-chain multiple hydrophilic group-type<br>
compound having two or more hydrophobic groups and two or more hydrophilic<br>
groups in the molecule.<br>
[0016] In the multi-chain multiple hydrophilic group compound of (A), it is preferable<br>
that at least one of the hydrophobic groups is an acyl group, and at least one of the<br>
hydrophilic groups is a carboxyl group, sulfonate group, sulfate ester group,<br>
phosphate ester group, or a salt thereof, and it is more preferable that the<br>
aforementioned multi-chain multiple hydrophilic group-type compound further has an<br>
amino acid residue in the molecule.<br>
[0017] Furthermore, a preferred multi-chain multiple hydrophilic group-type<br>
compound of (A) is a compound expressed by the following formula (1).<br>
[0018]<br>
[C1]<br>
Qn-X • • • (1)<br>
[0019] (In formula (1), X represents a spacer with a molecular weight of one million<br>
or less, has m functional group residues that may be the same or different, and may<br>
have other functional groups. Q represents a functional group as expressed by the<br>
following formula (2), the functional groups may be the same or different.<br>
[0020]<br>
[C2]<br><br>
[0021] In formula (2), Z represents a site of bonding with a functional group residue<br>
contained in X, R1 represents a hydrocarbon group that may be substituted with a<br>
saturated or unsaturated substitution group of from 2 to 20 carbon atoms, R2<br>

may also be substituted with a substitution group, and Y represents a carboxyl group,<br>
a sulfonate group, a sulfate ester group, a phosphate ester group, or a salt thereof, j<br>
and k independently represent either 0, 1, or 2, but j and k cannot both be 0 at the<br>
same time, n is an integer from 2 to 20. Furthermore, m is an integer such that m &gt;<br>
n.).<br>
[0022] In particular, the aforementioned multi-chain multiple hydrophilic group-type<br>
compound of (A) preferably is a compound expressed by the following formula (3).<br>
[0023]<br>
[C3]<br><br>
[0024] (In formula (3), R11 and R12 each independently represent a hydrocarbon<br>
group which may be substituted with a saturated or unsaturated substitution group of<br>
from 8 to 20 carbon atoms, R21 and R22 each independently represent either a<br>
hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl group of from 1 to 3 carbon atoms that may be<br>
substituted with a substitution group, each Y' independently represents a carboxyl<br>
group or a salt thereof, each W independently represents -0-, -S-, or -NR'- (where<br>
R' represents a hydrogen atom or a hydrocarbon group of from 1 to 10 carbon atoms<br>
which may be substituted with a substitution group), and T represents a spacer of<br>
from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, j1, j2, k1, and k2 independently represent either 0, 1, or 2,<br>
but j1 and k1, and j2 and k2 cannot be both 0 at the same time.).<br>
[0025] Furthermore, the multi-chain multiple hydrophilic group-type compound of (A)<br>
preferably forms a liquid crystal, and therefore the body surface protecting<br>
composition also preferably comprise an oil component (B).<br>
[0026] In the present invention, the multi-chain multiple hydrophilic group-type<br>
compound refers to a compound that has two or more hydrophobic groups and two or<br>
more hydrophilic groups in a molecule, and the hydrophobic groups are not<br>
necessarily restricted to chain compounds.<br>

[0048] X preferably has from 1 to carbons, more preferably from 1 to 20 carbons.<br>
Furthermore, X is preferably in a naturally existing form, because the biodegradability<br>
will be excellent.<br>
[0049] When X is an amino acid residue, the affinity of the compound expressed in<br>
formula (1) towards skin and hair will be high, and the compound expressed in<br>
formula (1) will easily permeate into skin and hair so the effect of improving the<br>
barrier function will be further accelerated.<br>
[0050] In formula (1), Q is a substitution group expressed in formula (2), and each<br>
functional groups may be the same or different.<br>
[0051]<br>
• [C5]<br><br>
[0052] In formula (2), R1 represents a hydrocarbon group that may be substituted<br>
with a saturated or unsaturated substitution group of from 2 to 20 carbon atoms, and<br>
may be a straight chain, branched chain, or ring. A saturated or unsaturated<br>
hydrocarbon group of from 8 to 20 carbon atoms is preferable.<br>
[0053] In formula (2), R2 represents a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl group of from 1<br>
to 3 carbon atoms such as a carboxyl group, a sulfonate group, a sulfate ester group,<br>
a phosphate ester group, or salts thereof, and may also be substituted. Examples<br>
include a methyl group, an ethyl group, a propyl group, an isopropyl group, a<br>

dihydroxy(iso)propyl group, a carboxymethyl group, a carboxyethyl group, a<br>

[0054] In formula (2), Y represents a carboxyl group, a sulfonate group, a sulfate<br>
ester group, a phosphate ester group, or a salt thereof. Salts of carboxyl groups,<br>

[0055] In formula (2), Z is a site of a bonding with a functional group residue<br>
contained in X.<br>
[0056] A preferred substitution group Q expressed in formula (2) is a residue of an<br>
N-acylated acidic amino acid because the effect of improving the barrier function of<br>
the skin and hair will be further enhanced. Acidic amino acid as used in the present<br>
invention refers to a monoaminodicarboxylic acid having 2 carboxyl groups and 1<br>
amino group present in a molecule, and the amino group may be an N-methyl group<br>
or an N-ethyl group. The substitution group Q expressed in formula (2) can be any<br>
optical isomers of a D-isomer, L-isomer or racemic body, but Q is preferably a<br>
residue of an L-acidic amino acid compound because the biodegradability will be<br>
excellent.<br>
[0057] Examples of acidic amino acids include glutamic acid, asparatic acid,<br>
lanthionine, ß-methyllanthionine, cystathionine, diencolic acid, felinine, aminomalonic<br>
acid, ß-oxyasparginic acid, a-amino-a-methylsuccinic acid, ß-oxyglutamic acid, ?-<br>

aminosebacic acid, and pantotenic acid.<br>
[0058] The top layer of human skin and hair is a layer known as the horny layer, and<br>
this horny layer consits of cells that have been keratinized (keratinized cells), and<br>
"intercellular lipids" that fill in the gaps of the cells. The barrier function of the skin is<br>
thought to be primarily dependent on the "intercellular lipids", and these "intercellular<br>
lipids" are primarily made of ceramides, and align in plane to adopt a "lamellar<br>
structure" that retains moisture between the structural elements. Degradation of the<br>
barrier function of skin and hair is thought to be caused by a loss of ceramides from<br>
the horny layer for some reason, and by disorganizing of the lamellar structure of the<br>
intercellular lipids.<br>
[0059] It is hypothesized that the multi-chain multiple hydrophilic group-type<br>
compound expressed by formula (1) can easily align in a plane because of the bulk<br>
balance and positional relationship of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups, and<br>
when the multi-chain multiple hydrophilic group-type compound permeates into the<br>
horny layer of skin where the intracellular lipid lamellar structure has become<br>
disorganized, the compound can easily create the lamellar structure together with the<br>
remaining ceramide. Furthermore, the surface activity and the permeability are high,<br>
so the compound easily penetrates into the horny layer when applied to the surface<br>
of the skin. Therefore, it is thought that when the multi-chain multiple hydrophilic<br>
group-type compound expressed by formula (1) is applied to the surface of the skin,<br>
the compound permeates into the horny layer, acts in a manner similar to ceramide<br>
replacing the ceramide that was lost, and restores the barrier function of the skin.<br>
[0060] The compound expressed by formula (1) is preferably the compound<br>
expressed by the following formula (3).<br>
[0061]<br>
[C6]<br><br>
[0062] (In formula (3), R11 and R12 each independently represent a hydrocarbon<br>
group which may be substituted with a saturated or unsaturated substitution group of<br>
from 8 to 20 carbon atoms, R21 and R22 each independently represent either a<br>
hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl group of from 1 to 3 carbon atoms that may be<br>
substituted with a substitution group, each Y' independently represents a carboxyl<br>
group or a salt thereof, each W independently represents -O-, -S-, or -NR- (where<br>
R' represents a hydrogen atom or a hydrocarbon group of from 1 to 10 carbon atoms<br>
which may be substituted with a substitution group), and T represents a spacer of<br>
from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, j1, j2, k1, and k2 independently represent either 0, 1, or 2,<br>
but j1 and k1, and j2 and k2 cannot both be 0 at the same time.)<br>
[0063] In this case, (A) have three carboxyl groups or salts thereof as hydrophilic<br>
groups, and this is preferable because the solubility will be improved and the<br>
permeability towards skin and hair will be enhanced as compared to a conventionally<br>
known double chain double hydrophilic group-type amphipathic substance or the<br>
compound where X has a hydroxyl group as a hydrophilic group.<br>
[0064] Specific examples of compounds expressed by formula (1) are shown below.<br>
[0065]<br>
[C7]<br>
[0077] The compound expressed by formula (1) can be prepared by reacting N-acyl<br>
acidic amino acid anhydride expressed by formula (4) with a polyhydroxyl compound,<br>
polyamino compound, polythiol compound, or a compound which has m functional<br>
groups and such as a hydroxyl group, amino group, or thiol group or the like in a<br>
molecule, either in water, solvent blends with an organic solvent and water, or an<br>
inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, benzene, toluene, xylene, carbon tetrachloride,<br>
chloroform, and acetone, or without a solvent, at a temperature that is from -5°C to<br>
200°C but in any case, above the melting point.<br>
[0078]<br>
[C19]<br><br>
[0079] The compound expressed by formula (1) can be prepared for example by<br>
dissolving N-acyl acidic amino acid mono lower ester or the like (such as methyl ester<br>
or an ethyl ester) and a polyhydroxyl compound, polyamino compound polythiol<br>
compound, or a compound having m functional groups such as hydroxyl group,<br>
amino group, or thiol group or the like in a molecule, in an appropriate solvent such<br>
as dimethylformamide, adding a catalyst such as potassium carbonate, and reacting<br>
while heating under reduced pressure at a temperature of -5°C - 250°C, followed by<br>
removing the reaction solvent; or by heating and melting them without a solvent,<br>
adding a catalyst such as sodium hydroxide and performing an ester replacement<br>
reaction at a temperature of room temperature to 250°C.<br>

present invention is not particularly restricted, but the amount of multi-chain multiple<br>
hydrophilic group-type compound of (A) is preferably from 0.001 to 20 mass%, more<br>
preferably from 0.01 to 10 mass%, and yet more preferably from 0.01 to 5 mass%. If<br>
the amount of multi-chain multiple hydrophilic group-type compound is below the<br>
aforementioned range, the effect of improving or preventing a degradation in the<br>
barrier function of the skin may not be sufficient.<br>

Examples<br>
[0100] The present invention will be described below in further detail using examples.<br>
Evaluation of the test samples for both the examples of the present invention and the<br>
comparative examples was carried out as shown below.<br>
[0101] 1. Skin Barrier Function Recovery Ratio<br>
The skin barrier recovery ratio is defined as shown below using the transepidermal<br>
water loss (TEWL (g/Hr-m2)), and evaluated based on the following criteria. The<br>
TEWL was measured using a Cutometer MPA 580 manufactured by COURAGE +<br>
KHAZAKA Electronic GMBH Corp..<br>
(Definition of Skin Barrier Function Recovery Ratio)<br>
TEWL recovery ratio (%)=[((TEWLsds) - (TEWL over time))/((TEWLSDs) - (TEWLo))] x<br>
100<br>
Herein, TEWI_o,TEWLSds, and TEWL over time are defined as shown below.<br>
TEWLo: The TEWL was measured on the forearm of a panel of 5 healthy males. TE<br>
WI_o was defined as the initial average value of TEWL for the panel.<br>
TEWLsds: A 5 mass% concentration of sodium lauryl sulfate (SDS) was applied to<br>
the forearm of each panel member in order to induce a condition of reduced skin<br>
barrier function and rough dry skin, and then the TEWL value was measured. The<br>
average value for the TEWL at this time was defined as TEWLsds- This SDS<br>
process was carried out to the extent that the average value of TEWL changed from<br>
7 g/m2hr for the healthy skin to 14 -17 g/m2hr for rough dry skin.<br>
TEWL over time: 2 uL/cm2 of test sample at an appropriate concentration was<br>
openly applied twice a day to the aforementioned rough skin, and the TEWL was<br>
measured over time for four days. The average value for the TEWL at this time was<br>
defined as TEWL over time.<br>
(Skin Barrier Function Recovery Ratio Evaluation Criteria)<br>
Skin barrier function recovery ratio is 60% or higher: ®<br>
Skin barrier function recovery ratio is 40% or higher and less than 60%: O<br>
Skin barrier function recovery ratio is 20% or higher and less than 40%: A<br>
Skin barrier function recovery ratio is less than 20%: x<br>
[0102] 2. Horny layer Condition<br>
Rough dry skin condition was induced in the same way as the evaluation for the skin<br>
barrier function recovery rate on the forearm of 5 healthy males, and then the test<br>
sample was openly applied, and the condition of the horny layer was observed four<br>
days later using a microscope (trademark, USB Microscope M2-S; manufactured by<br>
Scalar Corp.) at a zoom of 50X. The condition of the horny layer that was observed<br>
in this manner was evaluated according to the following criteria, and based on the<br>
average value of a panel of five persons, and evaluation of O was made if the<br>
average value was less than 1 point, A if the average value was 1 or higher but less<br>
than 2, and x if the average value was 2 or higher.<br>
Homy layer cells, skin ridges, skin grooves are clearly arranged: 0 points<br>
Horny layer cells, skin ridges, skin grooves are arranged: 1 points<br>
Horny layer cells, skin ridges, skin grooves are somewhat irregular: 2 points<br>
Horny layer cells, skin ridges, skin grooves are visible but irregular: 3 points<br>
Horny layer cells, skin ridges, skin grooves are blurred and irregular: 4 points<br>
[0103] 3. Human Patch Results<br>
0.1 g of test sample was impregnated into wax paper of 1 cm2, and plastered in a<br>
covered condition on healthy skin on the forearm of a panel of 5 healthy males for 24<br>
hours. After 24 hours, the TEWL was measured and the results of this human patch<br>
test were evaluated by the following criteria. A large increase rate in TEWL means<br>
that the sample tends to destroy the barrier function and cause rough dry skin.<br>
O: Average increasing rate of TEWL is below 10%<br>
A: Average increasing rate of TEWL is 10% or higher, but less than 30%<br>
x: Average increasing rate of TEWL is 30% or higher<br>
[0104] 4. Uniformity, Smoothness, and Stylability of Hair<br>
The test sample was thoroughly applied to a bundle of damaged hair that was<br>
prepared by the method shown below, which was then blow dried while combing.<br>
Evaluation was carried out by a panel of 10 persons from the viewpoint of "uniformity<br>
from hair roots to hair tips", "smoothness of the hair", and the "stylability of the hair".<br>
The evaluation criteria for "uniformity from hair roots to hair tips", "smoothness of the<br>
hair", and the "stylability of the hair" was as shown below.<br>
7 or more persons gave an assessment of "good": O<br>
From 4 to 6 persons gave an assessment of "good": A<br>
3 or less persons gave an assessment of "good": x<br>
(Method for Preparing Damaged Hair)<br>
A bundle of damaged hair was prepared by repeating 4 cycles of a process<br>
consisting of applying a permanent wave treatment, brushing 100 times, bleaching,<br>
brushing 100 times,to a bundle of healthy hair (15 cm, 1 g).<br>
[0105] 5. Hair Damage Recovery Ratio<br>
The hair damage recovery rate was defined by the following formula using damage<br>
recovered hair prepared by immersion in a test sample for 1 minute and then drying<br>
the aforementioned damaged hair.<br>
Hair damage recovery ratio (%) = tensile strength of damage recovered hair/tensile<br>
strength of healthy hair x 100<br>
Wherein the tensile strength is defined as the breaking strength per unit cross-<br>
section area, and the breaking strength and the cross-section area of the hair are<br>
measured as shown below.<br>
(a) Breaking Strength<br>
The breaking strength was determined using a tensilon tensile tester.<br>
¦ Tensile speed- ¦ -20 mm/min<br>
• Test hair length- ¦ -40 mm<br>
¦ Chart speed ¦• ¦ 100 mm/min<br>
• N number = 5<br>
(b) Cross-sectional area of a hair<br>
After having measured the breaking strength, the hair was cut at a position<br>
approximately 20 mm from the tip using a razor, and the area was determined by<br>
measuring a microscope image.<br>
6. Liquid Crystal Condition<br>
A test sample was dispersed by heating, and then observed at a magnification of 40X<br>
using a cross nicol polarized light microscope (CX31-P manufactured by Olympus<br>
Corporation), and the liquid crystal condition was evaluated according to the following<br>
criteria.<br>
30 or more maltese cross images can be observed from all view ®<br>
Maltese cross images can be observed from all view, but ® conditions not met<br>
Maltese cross image can be observed depends on view A<br>
Maltese cross image cannot be observed from any view x<br>
[0106] [Acyl Compound Manufacturing 1]<br>
9.1 g of L-lysine monohydrochloride (0.05 mol) was blended with 57 g of water. This<br>
solution was adjusted to a pH of 10 - 11 with a 25% aqueous solution of sodium<br>
hydroxide, while maintaining the reaction temperature at 5°C, and a reaction was<br>
carried out by adding 31.1 g (0.1 mol) of N-lauroyl-L-glutamic anhydride over 2 hours<br>
while stirring. After continuous stirring of the solution for 2 hours, tertiary butanol was<br>
added until the concentration in the solution was 20 mass%, and then 75% sulfuric<br>
acid was added in drops to adjust the pH to 2, and the temperature of the solution<br>
was adjusted to 65°C. After the addition of the sulfuric acid was complete, stirring<br>
was stopped, the solution was allowed to sit for 20 minutes at 65°C, and then the<br>
solution separated into an organic layer and an aqueous layer, and the organic layer<br>
was separated. Tertiary butanol and water were added to the separated organic<br>
layer, and the temperature was maintained at 65°C while stirring for 20 minutes.<br>
After stopping stirring, the solution was allowed to sit and separate into an organic<br>
layer and an aqueous layer. After repeating the same water washing operation on<br>
the organic layer obtained, the solvent was removed from the organic layer, and then<br>
the solution was neutralized to a pH of 6.7 (25°C) using sodium hydroxide followed<br>
by adjusting to a solid content of 30 mass%, and the solution was dried to obtain the<br>
compounds (mixtures) expressed in the following formula (5).<br>
[0107]<br>
[C20]<br>
The compounds (mixture) as expressed in the following formula (6) were obtained<br>
using the same method and conditions as example 1, with the exception that 31.1 g<br>
of N-lauroyl-L-glutamic anhydride was replaced with 39.5 g (0.1 mol) of N-stearoyl-L-<br>
glutamic anhydride, and instead of neutralizing the pH of the solution to 6.7 (25°C)<br>
and adjusting the solid content to 30 mass%, the pH was neutralized to 7 (60°C), and<br>
the solid content was adjusted to 20 mass%.<br>
[0110]<br>
[C21]<br>
[0112] [Acyl Compound Manufacturing 3]<br>
The compounds (mixture) as shown in the following formula (7) were obtained using<br>
the same method and conditions as example 1, with the exception that the 31.1 g of<br>
N-lauroyl-L-glutamic anhydride was replaced with 31.1 g (0.1 mol) of N-cocooyl-L-<br>
glutamic anhydride, and potassium hydroxide was used for neutralization when the<br>
solution was neutralized and adjusted to a solid content of 30 mass% and a pH of 6.7<br>
(25°C).<br>
[0113]<br>
[C22]<br>
[0115] [Examples 1 through 9 and Comparative Examples 1 through 6]<br>
The components shown in Table 1 were combined in the amounts (mass parts)<br>
shown in Table 1 to prepare body surface protecting compositions for examples 1<br>
through 9 and comparative examples 1 through 6. (Total amount was 100 parts,<br>
remainder was purified water). The skin barrier function recovery ratio and the<br>
condition of each layer was evaluated for each body surface protecting composition.<br>
The results are shown in Table 1.<br>
[0117] [Examples 10 through 12 and Comparative Examples 7 through 9]<br>
Body surface protecting composition were prepared by combining the components<br>
shown in Table 2 in the amount (mass part) shown in Table 2. A human patch test<br>
was performed and the effect on the barrier function was confirmed for each<br>
i composition for protecting human body surface. The results are shown in Table 2.<br><br>
mass%.<br>
[0119] Compositions containing the multi-chain multiple hydrophilic group-type<br>
D compound of manufacturing examples 1 through 3 were confirmed as not having a<br>
negative effect on the barrier function. On the other hand, a composition containing<br>
sodium lauroyl glutamate, a composition containing sodium lauroyl glutamate and<br>
lysine, and a composition containing potassium cocoyl glycine, which are single<br>
chain-type compounds that have basic constitutional units similar to the multi-chain<br>
multiple hydrophilic group-type compounds of examples 1 and 3 were confirmed as<br>
degrading the barrier function.<br>
[0120] From the above, it was confirmed that multi-chain multiple hydrophilic group-<br>
type compounds have an effect on improving the barrier function of skin and hair<br>
originating from their overall structure.<br>

[0131] (Evaluation)<br>
The skin barrier function recovery ratio, hair uniformity, smoothness, and stylability,<br>
and liquid crystal condition were evaluated for Examples 20 through 24 and<br>
Comparative Examples 10 and 11. The results are shown in Table 3.<br>
[0133] Formation of liquid crystal was confirmed in the compositions of Examples 20<br>
through 22 and 24, and in particular, formation of spherical crystals were clearly<br>
confirmed in the compositions of Examples 21, 22, and 24.<br>
[0134] From the above, it was confirmed that a body surface protecting composition<br>
containing multi-chain multiple hydrophilic group-type compound (A) of the present<br>
invention formed liquid crystals, and it was also confirmed that the formation of liquid<br>
crystal was facilitated when the composition also contained oil-based component (B).<br>
Furthermore, when liquid crystals were formed, in addition to the function of<br>
accelerating skin barrier recovery, the effect of improving hair, particularly hair tips,<br>
that had been damaged was also confirmed.<br>
[0135] Example 25<br>
Body surface protecting compositions were prepared by combining the components<br>
shown in Table 4 in the amount (mass part) shown in Table 4. The liquid crystal<br>
condition of these compositions was evaluated. The results are shown in Table 4.<br><br>
Observations were made at 40X zoom using a cross nicol polarized light microscope.<br>
®: 30 or more maltese cross images can be observed from all view<br>
O: Maltese cross images can be observed from all view<br>
A: Maltese cross image can be observed depends on view<br>
x: Maltese cross image can not be observed from any view<br>
[0137] Formation of liquid crystals was confirmed in the composition where<br>
cholesterol (molecular weight 387) and lauric acid (molecular weight 200) were<br>
added with a molar ratio to a multi-chain multiple hydrophilic group-type compound<br>
(molecular weight 835) of from 1/50 to 50/1, and in particular, formation was clearly<br>
confirmed in the composition with a molar ratio of from 1/10 to 10/1, and very<br>
remarkable formation of liquid crystals was confirmed in the composition with a molar<br>
ratio of from 1/5 to 5/1.<br>
[0138] From the above, it was confirmed that a composition containing multi-chain<br>
multiple hydrophilic group-type compound (A) of the present invention could easily<br>
form a liquid crystal composition if oil-based component (B) was used in combination<br>
in a specific range within the ratio.<br>
[0139] [Examples 26 through 28, Comparative Examples 12]<br>
Body surface protecting compositions were prepared by combining the components<br>
shown in Table 5 in the amount (mass part) shown in Table 5. Comparative Example<br>
12 was purified water alone. The hair damage recovery rate was measured for each<br>
composition. The results are shown in Table 5.<br>
have an excellent effect of improving hair that has been damaged, and that effect will<br>
be increased if an oil-based component (B) is used in combination.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>

accelerate recovery of the barrier function of skin and hair when that function has<br>
deteriorated due to skin trouble or the like and will prevent degradation of the barrier<br>
function, and therefore can be used by adding to cosmetic compositions,<br>
pharmaceutical compositions, and body surface protecting agents and the like.<br>
