the N-oxides, the pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts and the stereochemically<br>
isomeric forms thereof.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) can be prepared according to art-known procedures.<br>
In particular, compounds of formula (I') can generally be prepared by reacting an intermediate of formula (II-A) wherein W1 is a suitable leaving group such as, for example, a halogen, with an amino derivative of formula (III) optionally in a solvent such as, for example, water, 2-propanol, diethylether, l-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone and the like, and optionally in the presence of an acid such as. for example, 1 N hydrochloric acid in diethylether. It may be convenient to perform the reaction under a reaction-inert atmosphere such as, for example, oxygen free argon or nitrogen.<br><br>
In this and the following preparations, the reaction products may be isolated from the reaction medium and, if necessary, further purified according to methodologies generally known in the art such as, for example, extraction, crystallization, distillation, trituration and chromatography.<br>
Analogously to the reaction procedure described above, H-NR'R2 (VI) can also be reacted with an intermediate of formula (II-B).<br><br>
(II-B)	(VI)	(I)<br>
Suitable solvents for the above reaction include, for instance, 2-propanol or 1,4-dioxane.<br>
In case Q is NR'R2 and R2 contains a hydroxy moiety, it may be convenient to perform<br><br>
the above reaction with a protected form of intermediate (VI) whereby the hydroxy moiety bears a suitable protecting group P being, for instance, a benzyl, and subsequently removing the protective group according to art-known methodologies, such as, for example, reacting with BBr3 in dichloromethane under nitrogen atmosphere.<br>
It is also possible to react H-X'-R6 with an intermediate of formula (II-C) in a suitable solvent such as, for example, 1,4-dioxane, thus obtaining compounds of formula (I') wherein L is -X1-R6, said compounds being represented by formula (I'-c).<br><br>
Depending 0,1 the nature of X a suitable base or acid may be used to improve the reaction rate. For instance, in case X is -0-, sodium hydride may be used as suitable base; or in case X1 is NR3, HC1 may be used as a suitable acid.<br>
The compounds of formula (I') may further be prepared by converting compounds of formula (I') into each other according to art-known group transformation reactions.<br>
For instance, compounds of formula (I') whereby Q is NR'R2 and R1 and R2 are taken together to form mono- or di(C1-12alkyl)aminoC1-4alkylidene, said compounds being<br>
represented by formula (I'-a), may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula (I') wherein R1 and R2 are hydrogen, with an intermediate of formula (I-V) or a functional derivative thereof.<br><br><br>
Also, compounds of formula (I) wherein Q is NR'R2 and R1 and R2 are hydrogen may further be reacted with an acyl nalide or an alkyl chloroformate in a reaction-inert solvent such as, for example dichloromethane, in the presence of a suitable base, such as, for example, pyridine, to form the corresponding amide, respectively, carbamate derivative.<br>
Some of the compounds of formula (I') and some of the intermediates in the present in¬vention may contain an asymmetric carbon atom. Pure stereochemically isomeric forms of said compounds and said intermediates can be obtained by the application of art-known procedures. For example, diastereoisomers can be separated by physical methods such as selective crystallization or chromatographic techniques, e.g. counter current distribution, liquid chromatography and the like methods. Enantiomers can be obtained from racemic mixtures by first converting said racemic mixtures with suitable resolving agents such as, for example, chiral acids, to mixtures of diastereomeric salts or compounds; then physically separating said mixtures of diastereomeric salts or compounds by, for example, selective crystallization or chromatogiaphic techniques, e.g. liquid chromatography and the like methods; and finally convening said separated diastereomeric salts or compounds into the corresponding enantiomers. Pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also be obtained from the pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate intermediates and starting materials, provided that the intervening reactions occur stereospecifically.<br>
An alternative manner of separating the enantiomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I') and intermediates involves liquid chromatography, in particular liquid chromatography using a chiral stationary phase.<br>
The above specified reaction procedures for the preparation of compounds of formula (F) or subgroups thereof, can also be applied for the preparation of compounds of formula (I).<br>
Some of the intermediates and starting materials are known compounds and may be commercially available or may be prepared according to art-known procedures.<br>
Intermediates of formula (II-A) wherein Q is NRlR2, said intermediates being represented by formula (II-A-1), can be prepared by reacting a pyrimidine derivative of formula (V) wherein W2 is a suitable leaving group such as, for example, a halogen, with HNR'R2 (VI) in a reaction inert solvent such as, for example, 1,4-dioxane, 2-propanol or the like. Different regio-specific isomers may be formed and can be<br><br>
separated from one another using suitable separation techniques such as, for example, chromatography.<br><br>
(V)	(VI)	(II-A-1)<br><br>
(V)	(III)	(II-B)<br>
A particular subgroup of the intermediates of formula (II-B) is represented by formula<br><br>
Intermediates of formula (II-B) can be prepared analogously to the preparation of compounds of formula (I') starting from intermediates (II-A) and (III).<br>
Particular intermediates of formula (II'-B) are those wherein W is a halogen, more in particular, a chloro atom.<br>
Intermediates of formula (V) whereby Q is NR1R2 and the L is L/-CH2 and is attached in the 2 position of the pyrimidine ring and W2 is chloro, said intermediates being represented by formula (V-a), can be prepared by reacting an imidamide of formula (VII) with a propanedioic acid ester of formula (VIII) in a solvent such as, for example, ethanol, and in the presence of, for instance, sodium, and subsequently reacting the thus formed intermediate of formula (IX) with a suitable reagent such as, for example, phosphoryl chloride.<br><br>
Intermediates of formula (V) whereby Q is NR1R2 and L is L'-CH2 and is attached in the 4 or 6 position of the pyrimidine ring and W2 is chloro, said intermediates being represented by formula (V-b), can be prepared by reacting an intermediate of formula (X) with urea or a functional derivative thereof, in a solvent such as, for example, ethanol, and in the presence of, for instance, sodium, and subsequently reacting the thus formed intermediate of formula (XI) with a suitable reagent such as, for example, phosphoryl chloride.<br><br>
Intermediates of formula (V) wherein Q is NR1'R2 and L is L'-CH2 and is attached anywhere on the pyrimidine ring, said intermediates being represented by formula (V-c), can be prepared by reacting an intermediate of formula (XII-1), for Q is NR'R2 and formula (XII-2) for Q is hydrogen, wherein W2 is a suitbale leaving group such as, for example, a halogen, with an intermediate of formula (XIII) wherein W3 is a suitable leaving group such as, for example, a halogen, according to the procedure of a Grignard reaction.<br><br>
Intermediates of formula (V) whereby Q is NR'R2 and L is -0-R6 or -NH-R6 and is attached in the 4 or 6 position of the pyrimidine ring, said intermediates being represented by formula (V-d), can be prepared by reacting an intermediate of formula (XIV) with an intermediate of formula (XII) wherein W2 is a suitable leaving group such as, for example, a halogen, in a reaction-inert solvent such as, for example, tetrahydrofuran or 1,4-dioxane, and in the presence of a suitable base such as, for example, potassium hydroxide or diisopropyl ethaneamine, or sodium hydride.<br><br><br>
The intermediates of formula (V-a) to (V-d) can analogously be prepared for the compounds of formula (I') wherein Q is hydrogen. To this effect, there is one leaving group W2 less on the pyrimidine ring of the respective starting material.<br>
Compounds of formula (I') and some of the intermediates may have one or more stereogenic centers in their structure, present in a R or a S configuration.<br>
The compounds of formula (I') as prepared in the hereinabove described processes may be synthesized as a mixture of stereoisomeric forms, in particular in the form of racemic mixtures of enantiomers which can be separated from one another following art-known resolution procedures. The racemic compounds of formula (I) may be converted into the corresponding diastereomeric salt forms by reaction with a suitable chiral acid. Said diastereomeric salt forms are subsequently separated, for example, by selective or fractional crystallization and the enantiomers are liberated therefrom by alkali. An alternative manner of separating the enantiomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I) involves liquid chromatography using a chiral stationary phase. Said pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also be derived from the corresponding pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate starting materials, provided that the reaction occurs stereospecifically. Preferably if a specific stereoispmer is desired, said compound will be synthesized by stereospecific methods of preparation. These methods will advantageously employ enantiomerically pure starting materials.<br>
The compounds of the present invention and the intermediates of formula (II'-B) show antiretroviral properties, in particular against Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), which is the aetiological agent of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) in humans. The HIV virus preferentially infects human T-4 cells and destroys them or changes their normal function, particularly the coordination of the immune system. As a result, an infected patient has an everdecreasing number of T-4 cells, which moreover behave abnormally. Hence, the immunological defense system is unable to combat infections and neoplasms and the HIV infected subject usually dies by opportunistic infections such as pneumonia, or by cancers. Other conditions associated with HIV<br><br>
infection include thrombocytopaenia, Kaposi's sarcoma and infection of the central nervous system characterized by progressive demyelination, resulting in dementia and symptoms such as, progressive dysarthria, ataxia and disorientation. HIV infection further has also been associated with peripheral neuropathy, progressive generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL) and AIDS-related complex (ARC).<br>
The present compounds also show activity against HIV-1 strains that have acquired resistance to art-known non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. They also have .little or no binding affinity to human α-1 acid glycoprotein.<br>
Due to their antiretroviral properties, particularly their anti-HIV properties, especially their anti-HIV-1-activity, the compounds of the present invention are useful in the treatment of individuals infected by HIV and for the prophylaxis of these individuals. In general, the compounds of the present invention may be useful in the treatment of warm-blooded animals infected with viruses whose existence is mediated by, or depends upon, the enzyme reverse transcriptase. Conditions which may be prevented or treated with the compounds of the present invention, especially conditions associated with HIV and other pathogenic retroviruses, include AIDS, AIDS-related complex (ARC), progressive generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL), as well as chronic CNS diseases caused by retroviruses, such as, for example HIV mediated dementia and multiple sclerosis.<br>
The compounds of the present invention or any subgroup thereof may therefore be used as medicines against above-mentioned conditions. Said use as a medicine or method of treatment comprises the systemic administration to HIV-infected subjects of an amount effective to combat the conditions associated with HIV and other pathogenic retroviruses, especially HIV-1.<br>
The compounds of the present invention or any subgroup thereof may be formulated into various pharmaceutical forms for administration purposes. As appropriate compositions there may be cited all compositions usually employed for systemically administering drugs. To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, an effective amount of the particular compound, optionally in addition salt form, as the active ingredient is combined in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. These pharmaceutical compositions are desirable in unitary dosage form suitable, particularly, for administration orally, rectally, percutaneously. or by parenteral injection. For example, in preparing the<br><br>
compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols and the like in the case of . oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, syrups, elixirs and solutions; or solid carriers such as starches, sugars, kaolin, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of powders, pills, capsules, and tablets. Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit forms, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. For parenteral compositions, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, at least in large part, though other ingredients, for example, to aid solubility, may be included. Injectable solutions, for example, may be prepared in which the carrier comprises saline solution, glucose solution or a mixture of saline and glucose solution. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed. Also included are solid form preparations which are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations. In the compositions suitable for percutaneous administration, the carrier optionally comprises a penetration enhancing agent and/or a suitable wetting agent, optionally combined with suitable additives of any nature in minor proportions, which additives do not introduce a significant deleterious effect on the skin.<br>
It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such dosage unit forms are tablets (including" scored or coated tablets), capsules, pills, powder packets, wafers, injectable solutions or suspensions and the like, and segregated multiples thereof.<br>
Those of skill in the treatment of HIV-infection could determine the effective daily<br>
	amount from the test results presented here. In general it is contemplated that an<br>
effective daily amount would be from 0.01 mg/kg to 50 mg/kg body weight, more<br>
preferably from 0.1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg body weight. It may be appropriate to<br>
administer the required dose as two, three, four or more sub-doses at appropriate<br>
intervals throughout the day. Said sub-doses may be formulated as unit dosage forms,<br>
	for example, containing 1 to 1000 mg, and in particular 5 to 200 mg of active ingredient<br>
per unit dosage form.<br>
The exact dosage and frequency of administration depends on the particular compound<br><br>
of formula (I) used, the particular condition being treated, the severity of the condition being treated, the age, weight and general physical condition of the particular patient as well as other medication the individual may be taking, as is well known to those skilled in the art. Furthermore, it is evident that said effective daily amount may be lowered or increased depending on the response of the treated subject and/or depending on the evaluation of the physician prescribing the compounds of the instant invention. The effective daily amount ranges mentioned hereinabove are therefore only guidelines and are not intended to limit the scope or use of the invention to any extent.<br>
Also, the combination of an antiretroviral compound and a compound of the present invention can be used as a medicine. Thus, the present invention also relates to a product containing (a) a compound of the present invention, and (b) another antiretroviral compound, as a combined preparation for simultaneous, separate or sequential use in anti-HIV treatment. The different drugs may be combined in a single preparation together with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. Said other antiretroviral compounds may be known antiretroviral compounds such as nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, e.g. zidovudine (3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine, AZT), didanosine (dideoxy inosine; ddl), zalcitabine (dideoxycytidine, ddC) or lamivudine (3'-thia-2'-3'-dideaxycytidine, 3TC) and the like; non-nucleoside reverse transciptase inhibitors such as suramine, foscamet-sodium (trisodium phosphono formate), nevirapine (ll-cyclopropyl-5,ll-dihydro-4-rnethyl-6H-dipyrido[3,2-b : 2',3'-e] [l,4]diazepin-6-one), sustiva (efavirenz), tacrine (tetrahydroaminoacridine) and the like; compounds of theTIBO (tetrahydro-imidazo[4,5,l-jk][l,43-benzodiazepine~ 2(lH)-one and thione)-type e.g. (S)-8-chloro-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-5-memyl-6-(3-rnethyl-2-butenyl)imidazo-[4,5,l-jk][l,4]benzodiazepine-2(lH)-thione; compounds of the a-APA (a-anilino phenyl acetamide) type e.g. a-[(2-nitro-phenyl)amino]-2,6-dichloro-benzene-acetamide and the like; TAT-inhibitors, e.g. RO-5-3335 and the like; protease inhibitors e.g. indinavir, ritanovir, saquinovir and the like; NMDA receptor inhibitors e.g. pentamidine; α-glycosidase inhibitor e.g. castanospermine and the like; Rnase H inhibitor e.g. dextran (dextran sulfate) and the like; or immunomodulating agents, e.g. levamisole, thymopentin and the like.<br>

C. Pharmacological example<br>
Example C. 1<br>
A rapid, sensitive and automated assay procedure was used for the in vitro evaluation of<br>
anti-HIV agents. An HIV-1 transformed T4-cell line, MT-4, which was previously<br>
shown (Koyanagi et al.. Int. J. Cancer, 36,445-451, 1985) to be highly susceptible to<br><br>
and permissive for HIV infection, served as the target cell line. Inhibition of the HIV-induced cytopathic effect was used as the end point. The viability of both HIV- and mock-infected cells was assessed spectrophotometrically via the in situ reduction of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT). The 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50 in μM) was defined as the concentration of compound<br>
that reduced the absorbance of the mock-infected control sample by 50%. The percent protection achieved by the compound in HIV-infected cells was calculated by the following formula :<br><br>
whereby (ODT)HIV is the optical density measured with a given concentration of the test compound in HIV-infected cells; (ODC)HIV IS THE optical density measured for the  control untreated HIV-infected cells; (ODC)MOCK IS THE OPTICAL density measured for the control untreated mock-infected cells; all optical density values were determined at 540 nm. The dose achieving 50% protection according to the above formula was defined as the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50 in uM). The ratio of CC50 to IC50<br>
was defined as the selectivity index (SI). The compounds of formula (I) were shown to inhibit HIV-1 effectively. Particular IC50, CC50 and SI values are listed in Table 7<br>
hereinbelow.<br>
