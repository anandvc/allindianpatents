PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br>
1<br>
Description:<br>
Thread traversing device for a winding mechanism of a textile machine producing cross-wound bobbins<br>
The invention relates to a thread traversing device for a winding mechanism of a textile machine producing cross-wound bobbins with the features of the preamble of claim 1.<br>
It is known in conjunction with textile machines producing cross-wound bobbins, that, to produce a cross-wound bobbin, it is necessary, on the one hand, to set the bobbin into rotation and, on the other hand, to traverse the thread winding onto the rotating bobbin along the bobbin surface. To produce a traversing movement of this type of the winding-on thread, various thread traversing mechanisms are known here, which are also described in detail in the patent literature.<br>
So-called thread guide drums, for example, are very widespread and, in the case of very fast-running winding machines, apart from the thread traversing, also simultaneously bring about the peripheral drive for the cross-wound bobbin. However, with mechanisms of this type, which are described, for example, in DE 42 37 860 Al, bobbins .can only be wound in the manner of "random winding". In other words bobbins, in which the winding ratio becomes smaller in the course of the bobbin travel with the increasing bobbin diameter. Moreover, as there is always the same thread transferring angle in the case of thread guide drums of this type, regardless of the bobbin diameter, in the case of certain winding conditions, so-called winding patterns occur, if no particular measures are taken. As winding patterns of this type would lead to considerable problems<br>
2.<br><br>
2<br>
during subsequent unwinding, a large number of special pattern disrupting methods have already been developed.<br>
In order to be able to provide bobbins with a predeterminable winding pattern, for example a precision or step precision winding, a constant or at least partially constant ratio between the winding speed and the speed of the thread traversing has to be adhered to during the bobbin travel. To produce bobbins of this type it is therefore necessary to separate the drive of the bobbin from the drive of the traversing thread guide.<br>
Winding devices, in which the drive of the bobbin is separated from the drive of the thread traversing mechanism, are described, for example in DE 198 58 548 Al. These known winding devices each have a single motor-loaded drive roller and a separate thread traversing mechanism, which has a thread transferring arm. This so-called finger thread guide is driven here via an electromotive single drive, which is equipped at the extremes of the pivoting region with energy storage devices, for example a magnetic spring. By optimising the form of the thread transferring arm, for example, the mass inertia of these thread traversing systems could be minimised, so high traversing frequencies can be produced with thread traversing systems of this type.<br>
In these thread traversing systems, the thread-guiding part of the thread transferring arm, which is called, in brief, a thread guide, below, describes a circular path, however, while the thread running on between the drive roller and bobbin body has to be deposited in a straight line. Because of this circular path of the thread guide, it is not possible in these<br>
3<br><br>
3<br>
thread traversing mechanisms to position the thread guide close to the winding-on positions of the thread onto the bobbin. In other words, between the thread guide and the actual winding-on position on the bobbin there is a relatively large distance which, moreover, depends on the diameter of the bobbin. In practice this means that the larger this distance, also known as the drag length, the more the thread runs behind the thread guide and the greater the absolute lift distance becomes between the traversing width of the thread guide and the transferring width of the thread.<br>
To avoid drag errors of this type, winding mechanisms with thread transferring systems have already been proposed, in which a thread guide is traversed directly along the bobbin surface. A winding mechanism with a separate drive for the bobbin rotation and thread traversing, which has a thread guide traversing close to the bobbin surface, is described in EP 0 453 622 Al, for example. In this known winding mechanism, the bobbin is rotated by means of a driven support roller via frictional engagement. The thread traversing takes place via a belt thread guide driven by a single motor. In other words, a thread guide sliding in a linear guide is connected to a microprocessor-controlled stepping motor via a continuous traction mechanism, which is guided via lateral deflection rollers. The thread guide, in this case, slides back and forth parallel to the cross-wound bobbin surface and, specifically, as close as possible to the bobbin surface.<br>
The drawback in a winding mechanism of this type is, however, that thread traversing systems of this type have a very high mass inertia. In other words, in systems of this type, a relatively long and correspondingly heavy continuous trac ion<br>
4<br><br>
4<br>
means, two deflection rollers and the band drive itself have to be constantly alternately accelerated and braked again.<br>
Starting from thread traversing devices of the type described at the outset, the invention is based on the object of developing a thread traversing device, which intrinsically unites the advantages of the known thread traversing devices, without having their drawbacks.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention by a thread traversing device, which has the features of claim 1.<br>
Advantageous configurations of the invention are the subject of the sub-claims.<br>
The thread traversing device according to the invention not only has the advantage that the traversing thread guide, as in a belt thread guide, can be positioned in the direct vicinity of the cross-wound bobbin surface and therefore of the thread winding positions or a clamping gap, which affects the shortening of the drag length of the thread, but the thread traversing mechanism according to the invention is also distinguished by favourable mass inertia circumstances. In other words by dispensing with a closed belt and corresponding deflection pulleys, it is possible, on the one hand, to minimise the mass of the thread traversing mechanism to be moved, which has a positive effect on the achievable traversing frequency of the thread guide, and, on the other hand, to keep the drag errors so small that no negative consequences occur for the build-up of the cross-wound bobbin.<br>
5<br><br>
5<br>
It is provided, in this case, in an advantageous embodiment, as described in claim 2, that the finite connection means is configured as a flexible band and is supported in the traversing region in a stationary linear guide. According to claim 3, the connection means is also supported outside the traversing region in a stationary, circular guide. Guide means of this type reliably prevent the connection means being able to be bent up or down during the winding operation.<br>
The single motor drive of the thread traversing mechanism is installed in the region of the central point of the circular guide. In other words the motor shaft of the single drive rotates about the centre axis of 'the circular guide (claim 4) and drives the thread guide, in this case, via a stop means, to which the finite, flexible connection means is fixed.<br>
As shown in claim 5, the stationary guide is advantageously configured as a guide link, in which the connection means is supported during the traversing of the thread guide.<br>
The connection means is advantageously attached to the motor shaft of the single motor drive as stated in claim 6, via a lever, which is non-rotatably fastened to the motor shaft. A lever of this type, manufactured from fibre-reinforced plastics material, for example, not only has high rigidity and durability, but also has, with a corresponding configuration, a relatively low moment of inertia. In other words, by corresponding optimisation of the lever shape, the mass to be moved can be minimised.<br>
According to claim 7, a stationary guide corresponds to a movable,  circular or pitch circle-shaped band carrier,  on<br>
-6<br><br>
6<br>
which the connection means is deposited on withdrawal. In other words, the connection means is connected to the motor shaft of the drive via a movable circular or pitch circle-shaped band carrier and is over-grasped by a stationary guide, which prevents the connection means escaping upwardly when pressure forces are introduced.<br>
As shown in claim 8, the connection means is preferably manufactured from a material, in which a good ratio is provided between strength and mass. In other words the connection means is manufactured from a light material which nevertheless has tensile strength and is pressure-resistant. A configuration of this type ensures that the weight of the mass to be moved of the thread traversing mechanism is kept relatively low which has a positive effect on the traversing speed which can be achieved. Moreover, by using a material of this type, it is ensured that a thread transferring range adjusted is precisely adhered to; in other words, a precise thread transfer can be achieved.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment, the finite connection means of the thread traversing mechanism, as described in claim 9 is manufactured from a composite material, for example a fibre-reinforced plastics material or, as described in claim 10, a thin steel band is used as the connection means. In both cases, a comparatively economical connection means is obtained, the shear rigidity of which can be further increased in that the connection means, as shown in claim 11, receives profiling.<br>
In other words, the connection means has a cross-sectional profile, which may be, for example, ridge roof-shaped (claim<br>
7<br><br>
7<br>
12), arcuate (claim 13) or undulating (claim 14). Each of these cross-sectional profilings described above- and merely stated as possible embodiments, leads to a significant increase in the shear rigidity of the connection means, without impairing the flexibility thereof.<br>
The invention will be described in more detail hereinafter with the aid of an embodiment shown in the drawings.<br>
In the drawings:<br>
Fig. 1 shows schematically a workstation of a textile machine producing cross-wound bobbins, comprising a thread traversing mechanism according to the invention,<br>
Fig. 2 shows a schematic, perspective view of the thread traversing mechanism according to the invention.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a schematic side view of the workstation 2 of a textile machine producing cross-wound bobbins, in the present case a so-called automatic cross-winding bobbin machine 1.<br>
At- the workstations 2 of automatic cross-winding bobbin machines 1 of this type, as known and therefore not described in more detail, the spinning cops 3 produced on a ring spinner are rewound to form large-volume cross-wound bobbins 5.<br>
The cross-wound bobbins 5 are transferred after their completion by means of an automatically operating service unit (not shown), preferably a so-called cross-wound bobbin changer, to a machine-length cross-wound bobbin transporting<br>
8<br><br>
8<br>
mechanism 7, and transported to a bobbin loading station or the like arranged at the end of the machine.<br>
Automatic cross-winding bobbin machines 1 of this type generally also have a logistical mechanism in the form of a bobbin and tube transporting system 6. The spinning cops 3 or empty tubes circulate in this bobbin and tube transporting system 6, on transporting plates 11. Of the bobbin and tube transporting system 6, Fig. 1 only shows the cop feed section 24, the storage section 25 which can be driven in a reciprocating manner, one of the transverse transporting sections 26 leading to the winding heads 2, and the tube return section 27.<br>
The individual winding heads also have, as known and therefore only indicated, various mechanisms, which ensure proper operation of workstations of this type. One of these mechanisms is, for example, the winding device 4. The winding device 4 has a creel 8, which is movably mounted about a pivot axis 12. The creel 8 may also be pivotably mounted here, for example for producing conical cross-wound bobbins, about a further axis (not shown) arranged orthogonally to the pivot axis 12.<br>
As can be seen, in particular, from Fig. 2, the cross-wound bobbins 5 rests during the winding process with its surface on a drive roller 9, which is connected to an electromotive drive 21, which is connected in turn via a control line 22 to the winding head computer 28 of the workstation 2. In other words, the electromotively loadable drive roller 9 which can be controlled in a defined manner, rotates the cross-wound bobbin 5 by frictional engagement during the winding operation.<br>
9<br><br>
9<br>
In an alternative embodiment (not shown), the cross-wound bobbin is driven via a speed-controllable drive mechanism, which is preferably configured as an electronically commutatable d.c. motor and arranged directly on the creel 8 or integrated into the creel 8.<br>
In this case, the cross-wound bobbin 5 lies on a driveless support or pressure roller during the winding process and entrains it by frictional engagement.<br>
To traverse the thread during the winding process, a thread traversing mechanism 10 is provided. This thread traversing mechanism 10, which is only indicated schematically in Fig. 1 and shown perspectively in Fig. 2 and which traverses the thread 16 between the two end faces 19 of the cross-wound bobbin 5, consists, according to the invention, substantially of a thread guide 13 guided in a sliding manner in a linear guide 18 and displaceably mounted parallel to the surface 17 of the cross-wound bobbin 5, a finite connection means 20 and an electromechanical drive 14. As can be seen from Fig. 2, a lever 29 is fixed to the motor shaft 30 of the drive 14, which is connected to the winding head computer 28 of the workstation 2 via a control line 15. A flexible, finite connection means 20 that has tensile and shear strength, for example a thin steel band is connected to this lever 29 and has a thread guide 13 at the end. The connection means 20 is supported, in this case, in the region of the lever 29, for example on a guide link 23 and slides in the traversing region B in the linear guide 18. In other words, with corresponding control of the reciprocating electromotive single drive 14, for example a stepping motor, the lever 29 oscillates back and<br>
10<br><br>
10<br>
forth between two adjustable end positions at a predeterminable frequency. The thread guide 13 is traversed via the connection means 20, which has tensile strength and is pressure-resistant, inside the traversing region B which can be predetermined by the end positions of the lever 29, in the direct vicinity of the winding-on points of the thread 16 onto the surface of the cross-wound bobbin or the clamping gap and ensures that the thread 16 is wound on at a constant crossing angle and with a short drag length onto the cross-wound bobbin 5.<br>
The finite, flexible connection means 20 is, in this case, advantageously manufactured from a material, which has a good ratio between strength and mass. In other words, the connection means 20 is manufactured, for example, from a composite material, preferably a fibre-reinforced plastics material. However, a thin steel band can be used, as an alternative, as the connection means 20.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the connection means 20 also has profiling, by means of which the shear rigidity of the connection means 20, in particular, is significantly increased. The cross-sectional profile may be ridge roof-shaped, arcuate or undulating, for example.<br>
The cross-sectional profile of the connection means is, in this case, expressly not to be limited to the above-described cross-sectional shapes, however, but is also to comprise further known cross-sectional shapes, which are suitable for increasing the shear rigidity of the connection means.<br>
