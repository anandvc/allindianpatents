his invention relates to Working Models of the Solar System which demonstrate the relative motions of le Sun and one or more of the other bodies of the Solar system. More specifically, the invention relates to Working Model of the Solar system demonstrating the relative motions of the Sun, the Earth and the loon<br>
v'orking models of the solar system are, and have been, referred to as Tellurians, orreries and other terms. 1 the specification and claims hereinbelow, the expression 'Working models of the solar system' is also itcnded to cover Tellurians. Orreries and other such synonymous terms.<br>
a working models of the Solar system, the object is to demonstrate the complex relative motions of the uii, the Earth and the Moon, the features of said relative motions being:<br>
[)	the diurnal motion of the Earth, that is, the rotation of the Earth about its own axis, which causes<br>
the cycles of days and nights; ii)        the orbital motion of the Earth round the Sim leading to the change of seasons; iii)       the inclinations of the Earth's axis to the plane of the Earth's orbit; iv)        the directions of the Earth's axis in space remaining constant during the motion of the Earth in its<br>
orbit;<br>
v)	the variations in seasons and in the lengths of days and nights and in simlight hours as a<br>
consequence of (ii), (iii) and (iv); vi)        the orbital motion of the Moon round the Earth; vii)      the formation of moon phases, eclipses and the umbras and penumbras as a consequence of (vi);<br>
and viii)      the motion of the Moon about its own axis such that the same side of the Moon constantly faces<br>
the Earth.<br>
iVorkdng models of the Solar system of the invention provide demonstration of all the abovementioned eatures unlike existing models of the Solar system.<br><br>
Furthemiore, in the existing working models of the Solar system the following disach'antages/drawbacks have been observed:<br>
(i)	complicated, bulky and heavy drive systems comprising long gear trains and/or rail systems both<br>
of which have high frictional resistance; (li)        the necessity to provide multiple prime movers; (iii)       the problem of demonstrating the unclianging direction of the Earth's axis in space during the<br>
orbital motion of the Earth; and (iv)        the problem of providing for the orbital motion of the Moon round the Earth with the same side of<br>
the Moon constantly facing the earth.<br>
In the Working Models of the Solar system, according to the invention, all the drives comprise wheels/pulleys which are coupled to each other by means of one or more strings, ropes or belts. Tliis adoption of stringed, roped or belted drives to working models of the Solar s&gt;'stem is novel.<br>
The advantages of adoption of said stringed, roped or belted drives to working models of the Solar system are:<br>
(i)	low friction in the drive system and consequently lower power consumption;<br>
(ii)        simpler and more lightweight design and construction;<br>
(iii)       easily adapted to use of a single prime mover which may be manual, electrical, clockwork or<br>
other types; and (iv)        reduction iii cost.<br>
In the interests of succinctness, the expression 'a pair of coupled wheels/pulleys' in the description and claims hereinbelow is intended to mean two wheels/pulleys drivingly connected to each other by means of<br><br>
one or more strings, ropes or belts. Similarly, the expression 'a pair of stringed, roped or belted wheels/pulleys' is also intended to mean the same.<br>
In a pair of stringed, roped or belted wheels/pulleys if one of said wheels/pulleys is held stationary and the other is moved in an orbit around the first then the said other will undergo rotation about its own axis during said orbital motion, the rate of said rotation being dependent upon the ratio of diameters of said first and second wheels/pulleys. And, if the diameters of said pair of wheels/pulleys are equal then the said other will undergo exactly one revolution during one orbit around the said first. This is a novel drive.<br>
This novel drive comprising a pair of coupled wheels/pulleys wherein one of said wheels/pulleys is held stationary while the other undergoes rotation on its own axis when made to move in orbit round the first is referred to in the specification and claims hereinbelow as the 'orbital drive'.<br>
This is in contrast to the conventional drive wherein in a pair of coupled wheels/pulleys one of said wheels/pulleys is the driver and the other the driven.<br>
This novel orbital drive is adapted to working models of the solar system so as to demonstrate with a high degree of synchronisation the constancy of the direction of the Earth's axis in space during the orbital motion of the Earth around the Sun.<br>
This is achieved by providing an orbital drive wherein both wheels/pulleys are of the same diameter. One of said wheels/pulleys is mounted on the Sun globe axis and is held stationary thereon. The other wheel/pulley forms the platform upon which the Earth and Moon globes are mounted Said platform wheel/pulley is rotatably moimted on the outer end of a radial arm the irmer end thereof being rotatingly located on the Sum globe axis such that upon rotation of said arm said platform wheel/pulley together with the Earth and Moon globes mounted thereupon move in an orbit around the Sun globe. The platform wheel/pulley is riged with an and  which forms the axis of the Earth globe, that is, for the diurnal rotation thereof and for the orbital motion  of  the Moon globe about the Earth globe. It will be observed that diuing<br><br><br>
own axis consequently maintaining with a high degree of synchronisation the constancy of the direction of the axis of the Earth globe in space.<br>
Said orbital drive is also used in the rotation of the Earth globe about its own axis corresponding to the diurnal rotation of the Earth. For this purpose a wheel/pulley is provided which is rigid with said Earth globe, the combination being rotatably mounted upon said axle which is located upon, and rigid with said platform wheel/pulley.    A wheel/pulley located on the Sun globe axis and held stationary thereupon is coupled with said Earth wheel/pulley to form an orbital drive for said Earth globe. The ratio of diameters of said two wheels/pulleys forming this orbital drive is such that the number of rotations made by the Earth globe during one orbit thereof round the Sun globe corresponds with the revolutions made by the Earth on its axis during one whole year, that is, during one complete orbit of the Sun by the Earth.<br>
Said orbital drive is also used for the motion of the moon globe. For this purpose, a wheel/pulley rigid with the said Moon globe is rotatably mounted on said axle the rotation thereof being independent of said Earth wheel/pulley which as mentioned hereinabove, is also rotatably mounted on the same axle. Said moon wheel/pulley is coupled to a wheel/pulley located on the Sun globe axis and held stationary thereon to form an orbital drive. The ratio of diameters of said two wheels/pulleys is chosen to be such that  the revolutions made by said moon wheel/pulley on its own axis during its orbit round the Sun globe corresponds with the number of orbits made by the Moon round the Earth in one complete solar year. Said moon globe is mounted rigid on an arm which extends from said Moon wheel/pulley and is rigid therewith, said arm being shaped such that the centreline of the Earth and Moon globes is perpendicular to the said Earth globe axis and further the following points are demonstrated:<br>
(i)	the distance between the Earth and the Moon in relation to the mean distance between the Earth<br>
and the Sun; (ii)        the angle the plane of the Moon's orbit makes with  the plane of the Earth's orbit; and<br>
(iii)       the same side of the Moon faces the Earth throughout the orbit of the Moon around the Earth.<br><br>
It will be observed that the working models of the Solar system of the invention overcome/avoid the disadvantages/drawbacks mentioned hereinabove.<br>
In a pair of coupled wheels/pulleys wherein the axial separation of said w heels/pullers changes dunng operation thereof the problem of the slackness of the coupling strings, ropes or belts arises   In the working models of the invention, tliis problem has been solved in a no\ el manner b\ incuns of idler/vvheels/pulle&gt;s which engage said strings, ropes or belts and are urged outwards by spring means so as to maintain substantially constant tension therein.<br>
Said idler wheels/pulleys are of small diameter and are mounted on arms which are either made of spring steel or are spring loaded. These idler wheels/pulleys engage said coupling strings, ropes or belts and provide substantially constant tension therein. It will be observed that as the common axis of the Earth and Moon wheels/pulleys maintains a constant direction in space during the movement of said wheels/pulleys in orbit around the Sun globe, the axial distance between the Solar globe axis and said wheels/pulleys will vary during said orbit. This would cause slackening of said strings, ropes and belts. This problem is circumvented by the provision of said idler wheels/pulleys.<br>
In a pair of coupled wheels/pulleys wherein the planes of the two wheels/pulleys are different and not coincident, the coupling strings, ropes or belts are liable to slip off. In the working models of the solar system of the invention this problem has been solved in a novel manner by mounting such wheels/pulleys in between the arms of generally C-shaped brackets which are provided with suitable guides for said strings, ropes or belts.<br>
Said generally C-shaped brackets have fairly long arms between which wheels/pulleys are mounted. Located on the ends of said arms are small suitably shaped guides which guide said strings, ropes or belts and prevent the slipping off of said strings, belts or ropes. Alternatively, guide wheels/pulleys can be used.<br><br>
According to the invention, therefore, there is provided a Working Model of the Solar System for demonstrating the relative motions of the Sun, the Earth and the Moon, comprising:<br>
a.	three globes representing the Sun (9), the Earth (14) and the Moon (20);<br>
b.	one or more wheels/pulleys associated with each said globe, pairs of said wheels/pulleys being coupled<br>
together by one or more strings, ropes or belts;<br>
c.	a radial ann (4) rotatably mounted on the axis of said Sun Globe and extending outwards therefrom;<br>
d.	a first said wheel/pulley (7), that is coupled by means of an orbital drive to a stationary wheel/pulley<br>
(10) located on said Sun Globe axis, said first wheel/pulley (7) being rotatably mounted upon the outer end<br>
of said radial arm (4), and that forms a platform that is rigid with an axle (13) that constitutes the axis upon<br>
which are rotatably mounted said Earth Globe (14) and furthennore an arm that is rigid with said Moon<br>
Globe (20) located at the outer end thereof;<br>
e.	a second said wheel/pulley (16), that is coupled by means of a said orbital drive to a stationary<br>
wheel/pulley (11) located on said Sun Globe axis, that is rigid with said Earth Globe (14) and that is<br>
rotatably mounted on said axle (13);<br>
f.	a third said wheel/pulley (17) that is coupled by means of a said orbital drive to a stationary<br>
wheel/pulley (12) located on said Sun Globe axis, tliat is rigid with said arm (19) carrying said Moon Globe<br>
(20) and that is rotatably mounted on said axle (13);<br>
g.	idler wheels/pulleys (22) urged outwards by spring means, engaging, at least, those of said strings,<br>
ropes or belts where the axial distance between the coupled pulleys/wheels thereof varies during operation<br>
of said coupled wheels/pulleys thereof; and<br>
h.  generally C-shaped brackets (23) with the wheels/pulleys mounted between the arms thereof and<br>
provided with suitable guides thereupon for said strings, ropes or belts, at least, in cases of those said pairs<br>
of coupled wheels/pulleys wherein the wheels/pulleys thereof are in different planes.<br>
The invention will now be described in detail with reference to Fig. 1 of the accompanying drawing wherein reference numeral 1 denotes the drive motor of the working model of the solar system. The drive may be manual, electric, clockwork or of other types. The Drive motor drives a belted counter pulley 2 that is of a larger diameter so as to cause speed reduction. A small pulley is located on the shaft of the counter pulley 2 and rotates with the counter pulley. Said small pulley drives the main grooved wheel 3 which is mounted on the axis of the Sun globe 9. The Sun globe axis forms the central axis of the<br><br>
working model. The grooved wheel 3 transmits motion to various parts of the working model through further grooved wheels located on the central axis.<br>
A radial arm 4 is attached to groov ed wheel 3 and rotates therewith. The outer end of the radial arm 4 carries a hollow tube 6. A grooved pulley 7, that is. the said platform wheel/pulley ha\ing a vertical axle 8 is mounted upon hollow tube 6 such that axle 8 rotates within hollow tube 6.<br>
The Sun globe 9 comprises an illuminated dome mounted on the central axis, the dome being of sufficiently large size for the creation of umbras and penumbras. Mounted on the central axis between the dome 9 and wheel 3 are three grooved wheels 10. 11 and 12 which are held stationarj' thereupon. Wheel 10 located the lowermost has the smallest diameter of the three, while wheel 11 having the largest diameter is located in the middle. Wheel 12 of the intermediate diameter is the uppermost. All three wheels 10,11 and 12 are fixed and do not rotate and form the said stationary wheels/pulleys of the said three orbital drives.<br>
The lowermost wheel 10 is coupled to pulles 7 and wheels 10 and 7 are the same diameter. Pulley 7 being located on radial arm 4 goes into orbit around the Sun globe 9 when the radial arm 4 rotates. With one complete orbit around the Sun globe 9 the pulley 7 describes one rotation about its own axis. An axle 13 is mounted upon pulley 7 at an angle of 23-1/2 degrees to the vertical and carries the globe 14 representing the Earth. The earth globe therefore, has its a.\is inclined at 23-1/2 degrees to the vertical and it will be observed that the inclination in space remaiits imchanged as the Earth globe 14 moves in orbit around the Sun globe 9.<br>
A grooved wheel 16, which is the said Earth wheel/pulley is attached to a tube 15 which is rotatably mounted on axle 13. The Earth globe 14 is mounted at the upper end of tube 15 and as the wheel 16 is coupled to the middle wheel 11 on the central axis, when the radial arm 4 rotates the Earth globe 14 undergoes rotation about its own axis, that is. the axis of tube 15 and axle 13. The diameters of wheels 16<br><br>
and 11 are such that a complete rotation of arm 4 about the central axis causes 365 rotations of the Earth globe 14 about its ovra axis, that is, while it negotiates one orbit round the Sun globe 9.<br>
Between globe 14 and wheel 16 is located another grooved wheel 17 which is the said Moon wheel/pulley and which is attached to another tube 18 which is mounted on tube 15 and rotated around tube 15. Wheel 17 is coupled to wheel 12 on the central axis and forms an orbital drive. A rod 19 is attached to wheel 17 and projects radially outward from wheel 17. At a short distance from the centre of wheel 17 the rod 19 has a 90 degree bend so that the end of rod 19 points in space generally upwards at an angle corresponding to the inclination in space of the axis of the Moon. Globe 20 is mounted at the end of said rod 19 and represents the Moon and is referred herein as the moon globe.<br>
As wheels 17 and 12 are coupled, rotation of radial arm 4 causes the Moon globe 20 to orbit around the Earth globe 14, the orbital plane of the moon globe 20 being at an angle to the orbital plane of the Earth globe 14 corresponding to the actual inclination in the solar system. This arrangement demonstrates the eclipses of the Moon and the Sun.<br>
Moon globe 20 is rigid with the rod 19 so that as the Moon globe 20 moves in its orbit the same side of Moon globe 20 faces the Earth globe 14 corresponding to the situation in the Solar system.<br>
As the axes of wheels 16 and 17 are inclined to the vertical, when the radial arm rotates round the central axis, the belts of wheels 16 and 17 will undergo periodical slackening. To maintain substantially constant tension therein, four arms 21 carrying idler pulleys 22 at their outer ends are provided. These arms are spring-loaded and their pulleys 22 engage the respective belts to provide tension in the respective belts. The spring-loaded idler pulleys 22 not only provide belt tension but also act as guides for the behs. This is a novel arrangement.<br>
As the axes of the two pairs of wheels, 16 and 11 and 17 and 12 are inclined to each other, thdr respective belts would have a tendency to slip off the pulleys. This is prevented by a novel arrangement in which<br><br>
each of wheels 16 and 17 is mounted within the amis of a generally C-shaped bracket 23 provided with suitably contoured, cun'ed guides located on said C-shapcd brackets to guide the belts and prevent slipping off of the belts.<br><br><br>
