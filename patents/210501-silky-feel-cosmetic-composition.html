COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (See Section 10 and Rule 13)<br>
SILKY FEEL COSMETIC COMPOSITION"<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVERL LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai - 400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed,<br><br>
WO2004/082653<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/001783<br><br>
SILKY FEEL COSMETIC EMOLSION CHASSIS<br>
The invention concerns a cosmetic emulsion base with silky<br>
feel aesthetics.<br>
5  Aesthetics are an important attribute of a cosmetic lotion or cream.  Consumers" judgement of such products is significantly determined by the aesthetics of skinfeel.<br>
Similar to different models of an automobile, cosmetic products often use a common chassis as a base formulation. 10  Product line variants such as moisturizing, anti-aging,<br>
herbal-and sunscreen formulations usually dose the featured variant additive at levels of less than 5% into a  chassis.  Manufacture costs are reduced through use of a chassis system.<br>
15  The difficulty has been to devise a chassis with the appropriate skinfeel aesthetics.  Furthermore, it is desirable to include high levels of glycerin for moisturization.  This presents a challenge for thickening and emulsifying agents to overcome the negative feel of<br>
20  glycerin.<br>
U.S. 2002/0131946 Al (Pham et al.) discloses non-sticky cosmetic moisturizing compositions based on glycerin and polymeric wetting agents, one of which is described as<br>
Pemulen® TR2.  Other than removing stickiness, there is no<br>
25  disclosure that these compositions impart any-particular skinfeel advantage.<br>
l<br><br>
2 -<br>
There is a need for a cosmetic concentrate chassis which delivers a silky skinfeel which can. be formulated with a variety of actives and promotional ingredients.  Still another need is to provide a concentrate with exceptional aesthetics and that imparts a high level of moisturization when applied to the body.<br>
Thus, according to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a cosmetic composition which includes: (i)  from 10 to 50% by weight of glycerin; (ii)  from 0.1 to 10% by weight of a co-polymer formed from a major portion of a monoolefinically unsaturated carboxyiic acid or anhydride monomer of 3 to 6 carbon atoms and a minor portion of a<br>
ClO"C22 acrylate or methacrylate ester monomer; (iii) from about 1% to about 30% of a crystalline gel structurant comprising a surfactant and co-surfactant irTan amount and type exhibiting an enthalpy as measured by Differential Scanning Calorimetry ranging from about 2 to about 15 Joule per gram, and wherein the composition has a normal force of from about +5 to about +50 grams thereby achieving a silky sensory feel on skin, the glycerin to co-polymer being present in a weight ... ratio ranging from about 350:1 to about 10:1;   the crystalline gel structurant being anionic or nonionic;<br>
when anionic the surfactant comprising a C10-C22 fatty acid and a salt of the fatty acid, the fatty acid and salt"being present in a ratio from 100:1<br>
to 1:100 and co-surfactaht comprising a C10-C22<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
fatty alcohol and a C1-C200 ester of a C10-C22 fatty acid, the alcohol and ester being present in a weight ratio from 100:1 to 1:100; and<br>
when nonionic the surfactant comprising a C1-C200<br>
ester of a C10-C22 fatty acid and the co-surfactant<br>
comprising a mixture of C10-C22  fatty alcohol, a<br>
glyceryl ester of C10-C22 fatty acid and a C10-C22 unesterified fatty acid.<br>
Cosmetic compositions of the present invention are provided with a tnoisturization effective amount of glycerine, which also is known as glycerol in the art.  Amounts of glycerin range from about 10% to about 50%, preferably from 12% to 35%, optimally from 15% to 30% by weight of the composition.<br>
Another component of compositions according to the present invention -is that of an emulsifying or non-emulsifying co¬polymer. The co-polymer is formed from a carboxylic monomer in an amount from about 50% to 99% by weight and a long chain acrylate ester in an amount from about 1% to 50% by weight of the composition. Amounts of the carboxylic monomer and the acrylate ester are based on the combined weight of both components.  It should be understood that more than one carboxylic monomer and more than one acrylate ester can be used in the monomer charge.<br><br>
- 3A -<br>
Co-polymers of this invention can be prepared from a monomeric mixture -which contains two essential monomeric ingredients, each in certain proportions, one being a monomeric olefinically-unsaturated carboxylic monomer of 3 to 6 carbon atoms and the other being an acrylic ester having a long chain aliphatic group.  Optionally, there is included in the monomeric mixture a crosslinking monomer. Amount of- the carboxylic monomer is generally in a major proportion, whereas the acrylic ester is used in a minor proportion. In a preferred embodiment, amount of the carboxylic monomer is 80% to 99%, but especially 90% to 98% by weight, whereas amount of the co-monomer is from 20% down to 1%, especially 10% down to 2% by weight, based on the weight of the two monomers.<br>
The co-polymers of a carboxylic monomer and an acrylic ester having a long chain aliphatic group can have polymerized<br><br>
WO 2004/082653<br><br>
PCT7EP2004/001783<br><br>
therein a minor proportion of a lower alkyl ester of-.acrylic acid, such as ethyl acrylate, in amount of 0% to 40% by weight, preferably 5% to 30%, based on the total monomer<br>
charge.<br>
5  The carboxyiic monomers useful in the production of the co¬polymers of this invention are the olefinically-unsaturated carboxyiic acids containing at least one activated carbon-to-carbon olefinic double bond, and at least one carboxyl group; that is, an acid containing an olefinic double bond 10  which readily functions in polymerization because of its presence in the monomer molecule either in the alpha-beta position with respect to a carboxyl group, or as a part of a terminal methylene grouping.  The anhydrides can also be used, especially maleic anhydride.<br>
15  The preferred carboxyiic monomers for use in the co-polymer are the monoolefinic acrylic acids having the general<br>
structure:<br>
20 <br>
wherein R is a substituent selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, halogen, hydroxyl, lactone, lactam, the cyanogen (-C-N) groups, monovalent alkyl radicals, monovalent alkaryl radicals and monovalent cycloaliphatic radicals.  Of this 25  class, acrylic acid itself is most preferred because of its<br>
generally lower cost, ready availability, and ability to form superior polymers. Another particularly preferred carboxyiic monomer is maleic anhydride.<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2004/082653<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/001783<br><br>
The preferred acrylic ester monomers having long chain aliphatic groups are derivatives of acrylic acid having the formula: <br>
5<br>
wherein R is selected from hydrogen, methyl and ethyl<br>
2<br>
groups, and R is selected from alkyl groups having from 8<br>
to 30 carbon atoms and oxyalkene and carbonyloxyalkylene groups, preferably alkyl groups of 10 to 22 carbon atoms. 10  The oxyalkene and carbonyloxalkylene groups are particularly oxyethylene and carbonyloxyethylene groups- Representative higher alkyl acrylic esters are decyl acrylate, lauryl acrylate, stearyl acrylate, behenyl acrylate and myristyl acrylate, and the corresponding methacrylates.<br>
15  The modified polymers described herein, when tested in the form of 0.2% aqueous mucilages, have viscosity of 100 to 50,000 cps, preferably 250 to 40,000 cps and especially 500 to 35,000 cps.  In the form of 1.0%, aqueous mucilages they have viscosity of 1,000 to 100,000 cps, preferably 2,000 to<br>
20  90,000 cps, and especially 2,500 to 85,000 cps.  These viscosities are measured using the Brookfield RVT Model Viscometer at spindle speed of 20 rpm in the pH range of 7.2 to 7.6 at 25oC.<br>
Commercially the emulsifying and non-emulsifying co-polymers 25  as described above are available from the Noveon Corporation<br>
under the trademarks Pemulen® TR2 and Ultrez® 21.  The CTFA<br>
3<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
name is acrylates/C10-C30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer. Amounts of the co-polymer used within the cosmetic compositions of this invention will range from about 0.1% to about 10%, preferably from about 0.1% to about 1%, more preferably from about 0.1% to about 0.5%, optimally from 0.25% to 0-5% by weight of the composition.<br>
Relative amounts by weight of glycerin to the co-polymer may range from about 350-.1  to about 10:1, preferably from about 150:1 to about 50:1.<br>
A crystalline gel structurant will also be present in compositions according to the present invention.  The structurant will include both a surfactant and a co-surfactant.  The nature of the surfactant and co-surfactant will depend upon whether the crystalline gel structurant is anionic or nonionic.<br>
For structurants that are anionic, the surfactants are QLQ-<br>
C22 fatty acids and salts (i.e. soap) thereof, and<br>
particularly combinations of these materials.  Typical counterions forming the fatty acid salt are those of ammonium, sodium, potassium, lithium, trialkanolammonium (e.g. triethanolammonium) and combinations thereof. Amounts of the fatty acid to the fatty acid salt when both present range from about 100:1 to about 1:100, preferably from about 50:1 to about 1:50, and optimally from about 3:1 to about 1:3 by weight.  Illustrative fatty acids include behenic acid, stearic acid, isostearic acid, myristic acid, lauric acid, oleic acid, hydroxystearic acid and combinations thereof.  Most preferred is stearic acid.  Among the fatty acid salts, the most preferred is sodium stearate.<br><br><br>
The co-surfactant for an anionic crystalline gel structurant<br>
is a combination of a C10-C22 fatty alcohol, a C1.-C200 ester<br>
of a C10-C22 fatty acid.  Relative amounts of the ester to<br>
the alcohol range from about 100:1 to about 1:100, preferably from about 50:1 to about 1:50, and optimally from about 3:1 to about 1:3 by weight.  Typical fatty alcohols include behenyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, cetyl alcohol, myristyl alcohol/ lauryl alcohol, oleyl alcohol and combinations thereof.  Esters of the fatty acid preferably<br>
are polyol esters such as C2-C3 alJcoxylated alcohol esters.<br>
Among these are the polyethoxy, polypropoxy and block. polyethyoxy/polypropoxy alcohol esters.  Particularly preferred are such esters as PEG-100 stearate, PEG-20 stearate, PEG-80 laurate, PEG-20 laurate, PEG-100 palmitate, PEG-20 palmitate, and combinations thereof. Preferably the co-surfactant comprises cetyl alcohol and PEG-100 stearate.<br>
The relative amount of surfactant and co-surf act ant for the anionic structurant may range from about 50:1 to about 1:50, preferably from about 10:1 to about 1:10, and optimally from about 3:1 to about: 1:3 by weight.<br>
Nonionic type crystalline gel structurants will have a surfactant and a co-surfactant different than that for the anionic systems.  The nonionic structurant surfactants are<br>
C1-C200 esters of C10-C22 fatty acid.  Esters of the fatty acid preferably are polyol esters such as C2-C3 alkoxylated<br>
alcohol esters.  Among these are-the polyethoxy, polypropoxy and block polyethyoxy/polypropoxy alcohol esters. Particularly preferred are such esters as PEG-100 Btearafce,<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
PEG-20 stearate, PEG-80 laurate, PEG-2-0 laurate, PSG-100 palmitate, PEG-20.palmitate and combinations thereof.<br>
The co-surfactant of a nonionic structurant will be a combination of a C10-C22 fatty alcohol, glyceryl esters of a<br>
C10-C22 fatty acid, and a C10-C22 unesterified fatty acid. Relative amounts of the ester to the alcohol may range from about 100:1 to about 1:100, preferably from about 50:1 to about 1:50, and optimally from about 3:1 to about 1:3 by weight. Relative amounts of the combination of glyceryl ester and fatty alcohol to unesterified fatty acid may range from about 100:1 to about 1:100, preferably from about 50:1 to about 1:50, and optimally from about 3:1 to about 1:3 by weight.  Typical fatty alcohols include behenyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, cetyl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, lauryl alcohol, oleyl alcohol and combinations thereof.<br>
The relative amount of surfactant and co-surfactant in ,a nonionic structurant may range from about 50:1 to about 1:50, preferably from about 10:1 to about 1:10, and optimally from about 3:1 to about 1:3 by weight.<br>
A crystalline gel structurant is formed by the surfactant and co-surfactant.  Indeed, the surfactant and co-surfactant combination in their relative ratio and type of material is defined by an enthalpy which may range from about 2 to about 15 Joules per gram, preferably from about 2.5 to about 12<br><br>
WO 2004/082653<br><br>
PCT7EP2004/001783<br><br>
Joules per gram, and optimally from about 3.5 to about 8 Joules per gram, as measured by Differential Scanning Calorimetry.  Furthermore, the crystalline gel structurant system advantageously may have a melting point ranging from about 30 to about 70°C, preferably from about 45 to about 65°C, and optimally from about 50 to about 60°C.<br>
Compositions of the present invention are not limited by any pH range.  However, a preferred pH ranges from about 5.5 to about 8.<br>
Thickeners other than the aforementioned co-polymer may but are ordinarily not present in compositions according to this invention. By the term thickener is meant any material which at 2% in water generates a viscosity greater than 5,000 cps, particularly greater than 10,000 cps as measured on a Brookfield RVT model viscometer at spindle speed of 20 rpm in a pH range 7.2 to 7.6 at 25 °C.<br>
Normal forces which are positive numbers reflect- a silky smooth skinfeel of the formulation. Negative values have been identified with a draggy feel which many consumers dislike.  Normal force is measured in the following manner. A rheometer that has a shear rate mode capability and a normal force transducer is utilized to measure the high shear normal force.  These devices are available from Rheometric Scientific ARES, TA Instruments AR2000, and Paar Physica MCR.  Samples are compressed between concentric parallel plates of diameter 25 mm and gap (vertical distance between the two plates) of 100 microns.  The measurements are made in a continuous logarithmic shear sweep mode with a<br><br><br>
WO 2004/082653<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/001783<br><br>
shear rate range of 0.1 to 10,000 s .  Each sweep takes 5<br>
minutes, and is conducted at ambient condition (20-25°C). The normal force is calculated by subtracting the baseline<br>
(defined as the normal force value at or near 100 s ) from<br>
the highest normal force value measured between 1000 and 10,000 s-1.  A positive normal force of 5 grams and especially 10 grams or greater is correlated to products/materials with silky sensations during rubbing in application. .<br>
The higher the positive value of the normal force, the better are the aesthetics.  Ordinarily, excellent aesthetics are achieved when the normal force ranges from about +5 to about +50 grams.  Particularly desirable is a positive" normal force in the range from about +10 to about +60 grams, optimally from about +25 to about +40 grams.<br>
Moisturization is an important aspect along with the sensory feel of compositions of this invention.  For this reason, the compositions may advantageously have a SkiCon Value ranging from about 10 to about 80, preferably from about 20 to about 70, optimally from about 25 to about 60.<br>
The SkiCon Value is measured with a SkiCon 200 instrument. Moisturization is measured on the skin surface through a conductance evaluation (micro Siemens).  Depth of measurement is approximately less than 15 urn.  The methodology involves the use of panelists (usually 10-20 in number).  These panelists are requested to pre-wash with a<br>
standard Ivory® soap.  After 30 minutes, the panelists" skin<br><br><br>
WO 2004/082653<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/001783<br><br>
are measured using the SkiCon 200 instrument.  A sample of 0.05 gram experimental product is then applied onto a 5 x 5 cm area marked on an inner forearm.  Post-application "measurements are taken two hours after the initial 5  treatment.<br>
Advantageously, compositions of the present invention will have low foamability. Lather Volume as measured" by the Lather Volume Test described in U.S. Patent 6,153,208, herein incorporated by reference ordinarily will be less 10  than 60 ml, but preferably less than 30 ml. ■<br>
A variety of other components may be present in the concentrates of the present invention.  Foremost is that of water. Amounts of water may range from about 1% to about 90%, preferably from about 30% to about 80%, optimally from 15  about 50% to about 80% by weight of. the composition.<br>
Emollient materials may be included in compositions of invention. These may be in the form of silicone oils, synthetic esters and hydrocarbons. Amounts of the emollients may range anywhere from about 0.1% to about 20  preferably between about 1% and about 50% by weight of composition.<br>

As is evident from Tables II-III, a silky skinfeel as 5  reflected by the positive normal force values is attained<br>
only in instances where Pemulen® TR2 is present.<br>
Particularly good performance was achieved where the surfactant/co-surfactant ratio ranged from 30:70 to 70:30. Optimum effect was in the 40:60 to 60:40 ratio area."<br>
10  Sample 5P when formulated without any glycerin and in the presence of 0.3% Pemulen® TR2 exhibited a normal force of 0,0. "A control sample similar to sample 5 without either Pemulen® TR2 or glycerin had a normal force of -23.  The synergistic combination of optimized crystalline gel<br>

SkiCon Value readings were taken on formulations according to the present invention utilizing different levels of glycerin. Table IV details the test results.  They illustrate the 5  excellent moisturization of high glycerol levels which,<br>
except for the presence of crystalline gel structurant and co-polymer, would impart a sticky/tacky sensory feel to the<br>
skin.  Thus, the presence of Pemulen® and the optimized        (<br>
crystalline gel structurant network despite high glycerin 10  levels provided an unexpected pleasant silky skin sensory, while still delivering increased moisturization.<br>
