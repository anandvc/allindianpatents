This invention pertains to a process and catalyst for the hydro-oxidation of olefins, such as propylene, by oxygen in the presence of hydrogen to olefin oxides, such as propylene oxide.<br>
Olefin oxides, such as propylene oxide, are used to alkoxylate alcohols to form polyether polyols, which find significant utility in the manufacture of polyurethanes and synthetic elastomers. Olefin oxides are also important intemiediates in the manufacture of alkylene glycols, such as propylene glycol, and alkanolamines, such as isopropanolamine, which are useful as solvents and surfactants.<br>
Propylene oxide is produced commercially via the well-known chlorohydrin process wherein propylene is reacted with an aqueous solution of chlorine to produce a mixture of propylene chlorohydrins. The chlorohydrins are dehydrochlorinated with an excess of alkali to produce propylene oxide. This process suffers from the production of a low concentration salt stream. (See K. Weissermel and H. J. Arpe, Industrial Organic Chemistry, 2nd ed., VCH Publishers. Inc.. New York, NY, 1993, pp. 264-265.)<br>
Another well-known route to olefin oxides relies on the transfer of an oxygen atom from an organic hydroperoxide or peroxycartboxylic acid to an olefin. In the first step of this oxidation route, a peroxide generator, such as isobutane, ethylbenzene, or acetaldehyde, is autoxidized with oxygen to fomi a peroxy compound, such as t-butyl hydroperoxide, ethylbenzene hydroperoxide, or peracetic acid. The peroxide is used to epoxidlze the olefin, typically in the presence of a transition metal catalyst, including titanium, vanadium, molybdenum, and other metal compounds or complexes. Along with the olefin oxide produced, this process disadvantageously produces equimoiar amounts of a coproduct, for example, an alcohol, such as t-butanol or methylphenylcarbinol, or an acid, such as acetic acid, Coproducts such as t-butanol and acetic acid must be recycled or their value must be captured in the market place. Other coproducts must be further processed into products of commercial value; for example, methylphenylcartbinol must be dehydrated to form styrene. {Industrial Organic Chemistry, ibid., pp. 265-269.)<br>
More recently, the direct oxidation of olefins, such as propylene, with oxygen in the presence of hydrogen and a catalyst has been reported to yield olefin oxides, such as        ^ ^^ propylene oxide, as illustrated in EP-A1-0,709,360. It is taught that the catalyst comprises Ci^, ^ ultrafine particles of metallic gold deposited on titanium dioxide, preferably, the crystalline f^^^
 <br>
operated at temperatures of greater than about 100°C, the catalyst exhibits low olefin oxide<br>
selectivity and high water production.	A<br>
Other hydro-oxidation processes are known, for example, as described in	o<br>
international patent publications WO 98/00413 and WO 98/0041 , wherein an olefin, such   C as propylene, is reacted with oxygen in the presence of hydrogen and a catalyst comprising gold deposited on a titanosilicate support or gold deposited on a support comprising a disorganized phase of titanium dispersed on silica. International patent publication WO 98/00414 describes a similar process wherein the catalyst comprises gold and a promoter metal, such as a Group 1, Group 2, or lanthanide rare earth metal, deposited on a titanrum-containing support. The catalysts of these references achieve better lifetime and better hydrogen efficiency at comparable olefin selectivity when compared with the catalyst of EP-A1-079, 360. The catalyst of WO 98/00414 also exhibits higher activity than the catalyst of EP-A1-0,709,36,0. Nevertheless, improvements in activity, lifetime, and hydrogen efficiency are still desirable.<br>
This Invention is a novel hydro-oxidation process of preparing an olefin oxide directly from an olefin and oxygen in the presence of hydrogen. The process comprises contacting an olefin having three or more cartDon atoms with oxygen in the presence of hydrogen and in the presence of a catalyst under process conditions sufficient to produce the con'esponding olefin oxide. The unique catalyst which is employed in the process of this invention comprises oxidized gold dispersed on a titanium-containing support. The words "oxidized gold" mean that the gold is present as non-metallic gold, that is, gold in one or more positive oxidation state(s) of greater than 0. Any modem analytical method (for example, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) or combination of analytical methods that can determine the presence of oxidized gold can be suitably employed.<br>
The novel process of this invention is useful for producing an olefin oxide directly<br>
from oxygen and an olefin having three or more carbon atoms. Unexpectedly, the process<br>
of this invention produces the olefin oxide at high operating temperatures and over a<br>
sustained period of time with high activity and high selectivity. Partial and complete<br>
combustion products, such as acrolein and cariDon dioxide, are produced in low amounts in<br>
the process of this invention. Significantly/the process of this invention can be operated at<br>
highertemperatures than prior art processes, specificall	temperatures from greater than^<br>
about 130°C up to about 300°0. Operation at higher temperatures advantageously provides steam credits from the heat produced. Accordingly, the process of this invention can be integrated into a total plant design wherein the heat derived from the steam is used to drive additional processes, for example, the separation of the olefin oxide from water, the<br><br>
latter being produced as a co-product of the hydro-oxidation process. Even more advantageously, in prefen-ed embodiments of the process of this invention, the hydrogen efficiency, as measured by the molar ratio of water to olefin oxide produced, is significantly improved when compared with processes of the prior art. In prefen-ed embodiments, for example, a water to olefin oxide molar ratio of less than about 10:1 can be achieved over sustained periods of time at high operating temperatures. Even more advantageously/in preferred embodiments, the process achieves improved olefin conversion with little deactivation over a period of at least about 100 hours. Most advantageously, the process can be conducted using lower gold loadings than those used in prior art processes.<br>
In another aspect, this invention is a unique catalyst composition comprising oxidized gold dispersed on a titanium-containing support. As noted hereinbefore, the oxidized gold comprises non-metallic gold, that is, gold characterized by one or more oxidation states greater than 0.<br>
The novel composition of this invention can be effectively used in the aforementioned hydro-oxidation process wherein an olefin having three or more cariDon atoms is converted to the corresponding olefin oxide. Besides being active and highly selective for the olefin oxide, in preferred embodiments, the novel catalyst of this invention utilizes hydrogen more efficiently and exhibits a significantly longer lifetime, as compared with catalysts of the prior art. Moreover, the catalyst of this invention achieves this high perfomiance level at operating temperatures which are higher than those used in prior art processes. Operation at higher temperatures results in useful steam credits for ainning associated or downstream processes. As an added advantage, the catalyst of this invention can be operated with lower gold loadings than those used in prior art processes.  A lower gold loading provides advantageous economic benefits. Accordingly, this unique catalyst possesses highly desirable properties for the process of oxidizing propylene and higher olefins to their corresponding olefin oxides.<br>
In one prefen-ed embodiment, the catalyst of this invention can be advantageously prepared by an impregnation technique that greatly simplifies commercial preparation, as<br>
compared with the prior art preparation method involving deposition-precipitation. The<br>
im■pregnation method advantageously avoids the handling of large volumes of gold-containing solutions and the need for carefully controlling pH.<br>
The novel hydro-oxidation process of this invention comprises contacting an olefin having three or more carbon atoms with oxygen in the presence of hydrogen and an    epoxidation catalyst under process conditions sufficient to prepare the corresponding olefin oxide. Optionally, a diluent may be employed in the process. The relative molar quantities<br><br>
of olefin, oxygen, hydrogen, and optional diluent can be any which are sufficient to prepare the desired olefin oxide. In a preferred embodiment of this invention, the olefin is a C<br>
3-12<br>
olefin, and it is converted to the corresponding C3-12, olefin oxide. In a more prefen-ed embodiment, the olefin employed is a C3-1 olefin, and it is converted to the con-esponding C3-4 olefin oxide. In a most preferred embodiment, the olefin is propylene, and the olefin<br><br>
oxide is propylene oxide.<br>
The novel catalyst which is employed in the epoxidation process of this invention comprises oxidized gold dispersed on a titanium-containing support. The oxidized gold is characterized as having a positive oxidation state, or combination of positive oxidation states, greater than 0. In other words, the oxidized gold is non-metallic gold. One skilled in the art will recognize that metallic gold (or elemental gold) has an oxidation state of 0.<br>
In a prefen-ed embodiment, the titanium-containing support comprises titanium grafted onto a titanosilicate^ as described in detail hereinafter. In another preferred embodiment, the titanium-containing support comprises titanium dispersed on a support, prepared by a method comprising dispersing a titanium-containing monomer, dimer, polymer, or mixture thereof onto a support. In another preferred embodiment, the titanium-containing support comprises titanium dispersed on silica, prepared by a method comprising dispersing a titanium-silicon oxide monomer, dimer, polymer, or mixture thereof onto a support. In one preferred embodiment, the catalyst of this invention excludes oxidized gold deposited on bulk titanium dioxide.<br>
In yet another preferred embodiment, the catalyst further comprises a promoter metal which is defined as any metal or metallic ion which enhances the performance of the catalyst. More preferably, the promoter metal is selected from silver. Group 1, Group 2. the lanthanide rare earth and actinides elements of the Periodic Table, as referenced in the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 75 ed,, ORG Press, 1994. In yet another prefen-ed embodiment, the titanium-containing support is prepared by a method comprising dispersing a mixture containing a promoter metal alkoxide and a titanium alkoxide on silica.<br>
Any olefin containing three or more carbon atoms or mixture of such olefins can be employed in the process of this invention. Monoolefins are suitable, as are compounds containing two or more olefinic bonds, such as dienes. The olefin can be a simple hydrocarition containing only carbon and hydrogen atoms; or alternatively, the olefin can be substituted at any of the cartbon atoms with an inert substituent. The term "inert", as used herein, requires the substituent to be substantially non-reactive in the process of this invention. Suitable inert substituents include, but are not limited to, halides, ether, ester, alcohol, and aromatic moieties; preferably, chloro, C1-2,  ether, C1-12  and C1-12 alcohol<br><br>
moieties, and C4-12 aromatic moieties. Non-limiting examples of olefins which are suitable for the process of this invention include propylene, 1-butene. 2-butene. 2-methylpropene, 1-pentene, 2-pentene, 2-methyl-1-butene, 2-methyl-2-butene, 1-hexene, 2-hexene, 3-hexene, and analogously, the various isomers of methylpentene, ethylbutene, heptene, methylhexene, ethylpentene, propylbutene, the octenes, including preferably 1 -octene, and other higher analogues of these; as well as butadiene, cyclopentadiene, dicyclopentadiene, styrene, a-methylstyrene, divinyibenzene, ally! alcohol, allyl ether, allyl ethyl ether, allyl butyrate, allyl acetate, allyl benzene, allyl phenyl ether, allyl propyl ether, and allyl anisole. Preferably, the olefin is an unsubstituted or substituted C3-12 olefin, more preferably, an unsubstituted or substituted C3-4 olefin. Most preferably, the olefin is propylene. Many of the aforementioned olefins are available commercially; others can be prepared by chemical processes known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The quantity of olefin employed can vary over a wide range provided that the corresponding olefin oxide is produced in the process. Generally, the quantity of olefin depends upon the specific process features, including for example, the design of the reactor, the specific olefin, and economic and safety considerations. Those skilled in the art will know how to detemiine a suitable range of olefin concentrations for the specific process features. In light of the disclosure herein, the quantity of olefin is typically greater than 1, preferably, greater than 10, and more preferably, greater than 20 mole percent, based on the total moles of olefin, oxygen, hydrogen, and optional diluent. Typically, the quantity of olefin is less than 99, preferably, less than 85, and more preferably, less than 70 mole percent, based on the total moles of olefin, oxygen, hydrogen, and optional diluent.<br>
Oxygen is also required for the process of this invention. Any source of oxygen is acceptable, including air or essentially pure molecular oxygen. Other sources of oxygen may be suitable, including ozone and nitrogen oxides, such as nitrous oxide. Molecular oxygen is preferred. The quantity of oxygen employed can vary over a wide range provided that the quantity is sufficient for producing the desired olefin oxide. Ordinarily, the number of moles of oxygen per mole of olefin used in the feedstream is less than 1. Preferably, the quantity of oxygen is greater than 0.01, more preferably, greater than 1, and most preferably greater than 5 mole percent, based on the total moles of olefin, hydrogen, oxygen, and optional diluent. Preferably, the quantity of oxygen is less than 30, more preferably, less than 25, and most preferably less than 20 mole percent, based on the total moles of olefin, hydrogen, oxygen, and optional diluent. Above about 20 mole percent, the concentration of oxygen may fall within the flammable range for olefin-hydrogen-oxygen mixtures.<br><br>
Hydrogen is also required for the process of this invention. In the absence of hydrogen, the activity of the catalyst is significaltly .  Any source of hydrogen can<br>
be used in the process of this invention, including for example, molecular hydrogen obtained from the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons and alcohols. In an alternative embodiment of this invention, the hydrogen may be generated in situ in the olefin oxidation reactor, for example, by dehydrogenating alkanes, such as propane or isobutane, or alcohols, such as isobutanol. Alternatively, hydrogen may be used to generate a catalyst-hydride complex or a catalyst-hydrogen complex which can provide the necessary hydrogen to the process.<br>
Any quantity of hydrogen can be employed in the process provided that the amount is sufficient to produce the olefin oxide. Suitable quantities of hydrogen are typically greater than 0.01, preferably, greater than 0.1, and more preferably, greater than 3 mole percent, based on the total moles of olefin, hydrogen, oxygen, and optional diluent. Suitable quantities of hydrogen are typically less than 50, preferably, less than 30, and more preferably, less than 20 mole percent, based on the total moles of olefin, hydrogen, oxygen, and optional diluent.<br>
In addition to the above reagents, it may be desirable to employ a diluent with the reactants, although the use thereof is optional. Since the process of this invention is exothenmic, a diluent beneficially provides a means of removing and dissipating the heat produced. In addition, the diluent provides an expanded concentration regime in which the reactants are non-flammable. The diluent can be any gas or liquid which does not inhibit the process of this invention. The specific diluent chosen will depend upon the manner in which the process is conducted. For example, if the process is conducted in a gas phase, then suitable gaseous diluents include, but are not limited to, helium, nitrogen, argon. methane, carbon dioxide, steam, and mixtures thereof. Most of these gases are essentially inert with respect to the process of this invention. If the process is conducted in a liquid phase, then the diluent can be any oxidation stable and themially stable liquid. Examples of suitable liquid diluents include aliphatic alcohols, preferably C1-10 aliphatic alcohols, such as methanol and t-butanol; chlorinated aliphatic alcohols, preferably C1-10 chlorinated alkanols, such as chloropropanol; chlorinated hydrocartbons, preferably C1-10 chlorinated hydrocartbons, such as dichloroethane and chlorinated benzenes, including chlorobenzene and dlchlorobenzene; aromatic hydrocartbons, preferably, C1-15 aromatic hydrocartDons, such as benzene, toluene, and xylenes; ethers, preferably, C2-20 ethers, including tetrahydrofuran and dioxane; as well as liquid polyethers, polyesters, and polyaicohols.<br><br>
If a diluent is used in the gas phase, the amount of diluent is typically greater than 0, preferably greater than 0.1. and more preferably, greater than 15 mole percent, based on the total moles of olefin, oxygen, hydrogen, and diluent. If a diluent is used in the gas phase, the amount of diluent is typically less than 90, preferably, less than 80, and more preferably, less than 70 mole percent, based on the total moles of olefin, oxygen, hydrogen, and diluent. If a liquid diluent (or solvent) is used in the liquid phase, the amount of liquid diluent (or solvent) is typically greater than 0, and preferably, greater than 5 weight percent, based on the total weight of the olefin and diluent. If a liquid diluent is used in the liquid phase, the amount of liquid diluent is typically less than 99, and preferably, less than 95 weight percent, based on the total moles of olefin and diluent.<br>
The concentrations of olefin, oxygen, hydrogen, and diluent disclosed hereinabove are suitably based on the reactor designs and process parameters disclosed herein. Those skilled in the art will recognize that concentrations other than those disclosed herein may be suitably employed in other various engineering realizations of the process.<br>
The unique catalyst which is beneficially employed in the hydro-oxidation process of this invention comprises gold on a titanium-containing support, characterized in that gold is present as oxidized gold, or in equivalent words, non-metallic gold. Oxidized gold is defined as any gold specie(s) having an oxidation state or combination of oxidation states greater than 0. Any modem analytical technique which can determine the gold oxidation state(s) or their relative amounts can be employed, including, for example. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). XPS data can be collected on a Kratos Axis 165 XPS instrument or a PHI 5400 XPS instrument using the features and conditions noted hereinafter, or any equivalenynstrument thereof. In some embodiments of the catalyst, particulariy those wherein organic iigands are present. X-rays may induce reduction of a portion of the oxidized gold. Under these circumstances, the percentage of oxidized gold measured by XPS may be lower than the actual percentage in the catalyst. In addition to XPS, high resolution transmission electron spectroscopy (HR-TEM) can be employed to analyze for the presence or absence of metallic gold particles. Any high resolution transmission electron microscope having a point to point resolution of 2 A or higher resolution can be employed for this purpose. Mie scattering, measured on an ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectrometer (UV-VIS DRS), for example, a DBS Model UV-3101 PC scanning through the 525 nm region, can also be employed to analyze for the presence or absence of metallic gold. When the catalyst is essentially white or faintly colored, essentially no peak above background is observed in the Mie scattering region, or at most, a very weak peak may be observed. These observations are consistent with the absence or near-absence of<br><br>
metallic gold. A gold elemental analysis can confimi the presence of gold and. by<br>
implication, oxidized gold when other techniques do not reveal the presence of metallic gold<br>
particles. Preferably, the gold oxidation state ranges from greater than 0 to about +3. Jn<br>
contrast, metallic gold has an oxidation state pj Q..	"^ ^<br>
Typically, the oxidized gold comprises greater than 30 percent by weight of the total gold content. Preferably, the oxidized gold comprises greater than 50 percent, and more preferably, greater then 70 percent by weight of the total gold content. In one of the most preferred embodiments, the catalyst comprises essentially oxidized gold, which means that greater than 90 percent by weight of the total gold content is oxidized. In another most preferred embodiment, the catalyst comprises greater than 95 weight percent oxidized gold.<br>
If metallic gold is present, no limitation Is placed on its absolute amount or particle size; however, the typical and preferred quantities of oxidized gold relative to metallic gold have been noted hereinbefore. Typically, the average size of metallic gold particles, when they are present, is less than 150 nm, even more typically, less than 50 nm. as measured by HR-TEM, In a preferred embodiment, essentially no metallic gold is present, which appears to correlate with better hydrogen efficiency (low water to olefin oxide molar ratio) in the hydro-oxidation process. When the catalyst contains essentially no metallic gold and the support is white, the catalyst is typically white or has a faint color.<br>
The gold loading on the support can be any amount which yields an active catalyst in the process of this invention. Generally, the gold loading is reaterthan about 0,001 weight percent (10 parts per million), preferably, greater than 0.005, and more preferably, greater than 0.01 weight percent, based on the total weight of the catalyst. Generally, the gold loading is less than 20, preferably, less than 10, and more preferably, less than 5.0 weight percent, based on the total weight of the catalyst. In one preferred embodiment, the process is advantageously conducted at a gold loading of less than 0.5 weight percent, more preferably, less than 0.1 weight percent.<br>
The titanium-containing support may take a variety of fomis. Preferably, the titanium in the support exists essentially as non-metallic titanium. The support, itself, can be any material, for example, to which titanium can be affixed including amorphous or crystalline silicas, such as siiicalite or MGM-41; aluminas; metallosilicates, such as, aluminosilicates and titanosiiicates; promoter metal silicates, such as, the silicates of Groups 1 and 2, and the lanthanide and actinide elements; and other refractory oxides and like support materials. Still other titanium-containing supports which are suitable for the hydro-oxidation process of this invention include porous crystalline titanosiiicates of the prior art, such as TS-1, TS-2, Tl-beta, TI-MCM-41, and Ti-MGM-48, as well as, stoichiometric and non-stoichlometric<br><br>
promoter metal titanates. The promoter metal titanates can also be crystalline or amorphous. Non-limiting examples of these include the titanates of Group 1, Group 2. and the lanthanide and actinide metals. Preferably, the promoter metal titanate is selected from magnesium titanate, calcium titanate, barium titanates, strontium titanate, sodium titanate, potassium titanate, and the titanates of erbium, lutetium, thorium, and uranium. As a further alternative, amorphous and crystalline titanium oxides, including the anatase, rutile, and brookite phases of titanium dioxide, can be suitably employed as the titanium-containing support.<br>
The titanium-containing support may be crystalline, quasi-crystalline, or amorphous, and may contain a regular or irregular arrangement of non-connecting or interconnecting micropores and/or mesopores. As used herein, the tenri "micropore" implies a pore diameter (or critical dimension as in the case of a non-circular perpendicular cross-section) ranging from 4 A to 20 A, while the term "mesopore" implies a pore diameter or critical dimension ranging from greater than 20 A to 500 A.<br>
In those instances wherein titanium is affixed to the support, the titanium loading can be any which gives rise to an active catalyst in the process of this invention. Typically, the titanium loading is greater than 0.02 weight percent, preferably, greater than 0.1 weight percent, based on the weight of the support. Typically, the titanium loading is less than 20 weight percent, and preferably, less than 10 weight percent, based on the weight of the support.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, the titanium-containing support possesses a plurality (two or more) of titanium coordination environments, resulting in a plurality of titar]iium_ species. The coordination environment relates to the number of bonds and the geometry of the bonds to titanium. As applied to titanosilicates, the coordination environments can include framework and non-framework titanium. By way of explanation, a crystalline titanosilicate possesses a three-dimensional structure, known as a "framework," constructed from SiO tetrahedra, wherein each oxygen atom bridges two silicon atoms. A framework titanium is defined as a titanium atom which has replaced a framework silicon. In contrast, non-framework titanium is defined as a titanium atom/ion which is connected to the framework typically through an oxygen bridge. There is no limitation on the manner In which the non-framework titanium is bonded onto the framework. Any type of bonding ranging from very weak interactions (weak Coulombic interactions) to fully coordinated (anchored or grafted) bonds, are acceptable. Thus, deposited, dispersed, and grafted  models are contemplated. A full description of suitable metal-support interactions can be found in B. Deimon in "Preparation of Solid Catalysts," Handbook of Heterogeneous<br><br>
Catalysis, Vol. 2, G. Ertl, H. Knozinger, and J. Weitkamp, eds., VCH Veriagsgesellschaft mbH, Weinheim, Germany. 1997, pp. 264-286. In another aspect, the titanium in this prefen-ed support, whether framework or non-framework titanium, is not limited to any particular site coordination, so long as there are a plurality of coordination sites. Coordinations, such as tetrahedral, trigonal bipyramidal, square pyramidal, octahedral, and distorted variations thereof are all acceptable. The plurality of coordination types may also be satisfied by having two or more variations of the same coordination, for example, two different types of tetrahedral coordination, as determined by analytical techniques described hereinafter. Non-limiting examples of supports containing non-framework and, optionally, framework titanium include titania (or other discrete titanium-containing compositions) occluded onto a support material, such as, a silicate or metallosilicate (for example, titanosilicate) framework; titanium deposited as ions or ion clusters onto a support material, such as, a refractory oxide or a metallosilicate (for example, titanosilicate) framewori
A novel modified titanosilicate has now beerj discovered which is a more preferred titanium-containing support for the process of this invention. This modified titanosilicate comprises a quasi-crystalline material with an MFI structure, as determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), and possesses a plurality of titanium species, as determined, for example, by XPS and/or US-VIS DRS, At least one titanium species is believed to be a framewori
The silicon to titanium atomic ratio (Si:Ti) of the titanosilicate support can be any ratio which provides for an active and selective epoxidation catalyst in the process of this invention. A generally advantageous Si:Ti atomic ratio is equal to or greater than about 5:1, preferably, equal to or greater than about 10:1. A generally advantageous Si:Ti atomic ratio is equal to or less than about 500:1, preferably, equal to or less than about 100:1.<br>
The synthesis of the novel modified titanosilicate is similar, in some aspects, to the preparation of TS-1. which is described in US 4,410,501 and by J. Thangaraj et aL {Journal of Catalysis, 130,1991, pg. 1); but in contrast to the prior art, the synthesis produces a   .^ titanosilicate with two or more titanium species. Along similar lines, the reaction mixture comprises water, a source of titanium, a source of silica, and a template in the form of an amine or a quaternary ammonium compound. Almost any source of silica is suitable. including tetraalkyiorthosilicates, preferably, tetraethylorthosilicate, or simply fumed or precipitated silicas, but preferably, not a silica containing sodium ions. The source of<br><br>
titanium is any hydrolysable titanium compound, chosen preferably from titanium tetra(alkoxide)s, more preferably, titanium tetra(ethoxide), titanium tetra{n-butoxide), or titanium tetra(isopropoxide); and from titanium tetrahalides, preferably, titanium tetrachloride; and from titanium oxyhalides, such as titanium oxychioride. Another source of the titanium and silica can be mixed titanium and silica composites, such as titanium or titania supported on silica, or silica and titania co-gels. The tiialkylamine is preferably a tri(C^_,5 alkyl)amine, such as, triethylamine, tripropyiamine, and tri(n-butyl)amine. The quaternary ammonium compound can be a tetraalkyiammonium hydroxide or tetraalkylammonium halide, such as, tetra(ethyl)ammonium hydroxide, tetra(propyl)ammonium hydroxide, tetra(n-butyl)ammonium hydroxide, and the corresponding halides, and the like, in the reaction mixture, the molar ratio of silica to titanium can range from 1:1 to 1,000:1, preferably, from 10:1 to 200:1, and more preferably, from 20:1 to 150:1. The molar ratio of water to silica can range from 15:1 to 500:1. preferably, from 20:1 to 200:1, and more preferably, from 30:1 to 100:1. The molar ratio of amine or quatemary ammonium template to silica can range from 0.1:1 to 4:1, and preferably, from 0.4:1 to 1.0:1. In a preferred synthesis, the source of silica and the source of titanium are mixed, and the resulting mixture is cooled to a temperature between 0°C and -6'C, preferably -4°C. The cooled mixture is then added rapidly, and typically without agitation, to a similarly cooled solution containing the template. The temperature of the resulting synthesis mixture is then raised, and the synthesis is allowed to proceed under hydrothemial conditions, more specifically, in an autoclave at a temperature between 110°C and 220°C under autogenous pressure for a time ranging from 1 day to 10 days. Alternatively, the synthesis may be conducted at atmospheric pressure and at a lower temperature, preferably between 70°C up to 110°C, for a time ranging from 1 to 20 days. In one method of recovery of the novel litanosilicate, the synthesis mixture is ultra-centrifuged to yield a solid, which may be rinsed and dried, for example, freeze dried, to obtain the novel titanosilicate product. In another suitable recovery method, the synthesis mixture is centrifuged, and the liquor obtained from the centrifugation is heated at a temperature between 50°C and 110°C to rid the liquor of volatile compounds, such as alcohol and amine. Thereafter, the resulting liquor is treated with acid, such as. nitric or hydrochloric acid (from 0.01 M to 5.0 M), until precipitation begins. The liquor is then recentrifuged to collect the novel titanosilicate product- In a third recovery method, the aqueous suspension of the novel titanosilicate product can be treated with inorganic acid to adjust the pH to between 7 and 9; and thereafter, the acid-treated mixture is centrifuged to collect the titanosilicate product. A fourth recovery method involves centrifuging the<br><br>
synthesis mixture to collect a crystalline solid, which is thereafter washed with acid, for example, 0,01 M to 5.0 M nitric or hydrochloric acid. The washing, which can be repeated, is generally conducted at a temperature between 23°C and 90°C. The solid product collected by any of these recovery processes is typically dried at a temperature between about ambient, taken as 21 °C, and 110°C, and then calcined under air at a temperature between 480^C and 750°C for 2 to 12 hours to yield the novel modified titanosilicate support of this invention.<br>
The novel titanosilicate, prepared as described hereinabove, possesses an orthortnombic structure of the MFI structure type, as determined by powder XRD. In contrast to some known TS-1 materials, the novel titanosilicate contains a plurality of titanium species, as determined, for example, by XPS. One XPS peak occurs at about 460 eV, this titanium being a low coordinate orframewori
Another preferred type of titanium-containing support comprises a disorganized phase of titanium dispersed on a support material, preferably, silica. The disorganized phase of titanium does not exhibit an organized, periodic crystallinity and can be distinguished from a bulk organized (crystalline) phase, such as crystalline titanium dioxide, by one or more modem analytical techniques, such as, HR-TEM, XRD, and Raman spectroscopy. UV-VIS DRS and titanium K edge X-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy (XANES) may also be useful in distinguishing the disorganized phase from an organized or crystalline phase. A preferred support containing a disorgariized J^^^ phase is described In international patent publication WO 98/00415, More preferably, the<br><br>
disorganized titanium ptiase also contains a plurality of titanium coordination environments as detemfiined, for example, by XPS and/or UV-VIS DRS.<br>
In the preparation of the support comprising disorganized titanium, generally, the starting support is impregnated with a titanium compound at a temperature between 0°C and 50°C, at about ambient pressure, for a time ranging from 30 minutes to 24 hours. Non-limiting examples of suitable titanium compounds include titanium alkoxides, such as titanium isopropoxide, titanium propoxide, titanium ethoxide, and titanium butoxide; titanium sulfate, titanium oxysulfate, titanium halides, preferably titanium chloride; titanium carboxyiates, preferably titanium oxalate and titanyl acetylacetonate; and organotitanium halides, such as dicyclopentadiene titanium dichloride, and other organotitanocene dichlorides. Mixtures of titanium alkoxides and promoter metal alkoxides, preferably, alkaline earth alkoxides, for example, barium alkoxide, can also be employed. Mixtures of titanium alkoxides and promoter metal alkoxides dissolved in a solvent, such as alcohol, can be obtained commercially, for example, from Gelest, Inc., and deposited together onto the silica. For the mixed alkoxides, the amounts of titanium and promoter alkoxides can be varied in the solution; thus the atomic or weight ratio of promoter to titanium can be varied, as desired. Alternatively, mixed titanium-promoter metal complexes, such as Li[Ti(0-Bu)J, can be deposited onto the siiica. In these true mixed complexes, the amounts of promoter and titanium are fixed, and the ratio of promoter to titanium is not variable.<br>
Other titanium compounds which are suitably employed to prepare the disorganized titanium phase include inorganic and organic titanium-containing monomers, dimers, and polymers, as well as cari bon-based polymers functionalized with moieties, such as alkoxides, bound to titanium ions, available commercially, for example, from Gelest, Inc. Non-limiting examples of suitable carbon-based titanium-containing polymers include poly(dibutyltitanate) and poly(octyleneglycol-titanate).<br>
Preferably, the titanium compounds which are suitably employed to prepare the disorganized titanium phase include inorganic and organic titanium and silicon containing monomers, dimers, and polymers, more preferably, titanium and silicon oxide containing monomers, dimers, and polymers. Such materials are well known in the art. The organic titanium monomer, dimer, or polymer may be any compound characterized by a backbone comprised of Si, Ti, and -(CRg)^- moieties, wherein the -(CR^)^- groups are bridging adjoining Si atoms, Ti atoms, or Si and Ti atoms (for example, -Si-(CR2)^-Si-, -Ti-(CR2),-Ti-, and -Si-(CR2),-Ti-), and wherein z is an integer ranging from 1 to 20, and each R is Independently selected from alkyl, aryl, alkoxy, and halide groups, preferably, C,^ alkyl, C^^ aryl, C,^ alkoxy, and chloro groups. Pendent to the SI and TI atoms are organic groups,<br><br>
which preferably take the form of lower alky! and/or alkoxide groups and/or aryl and/or aryloxide groups. Likewise, the titanosiloxane polymer may be any polymer characterized by a backbone comprised of Si, Ti, and 0 atoms. The oxygen atoms are bridging adjoining Si atoms, Ti atoms, and Si and Ti atoms (for example. -Si-O-Si-, -Ti-O-Ti-, and -Si-O-Ti-). Pendent to the Si and Ti atoms are organic groups, which preferably take the fomi of lower alkyl and/or alkoxide groups and/or aryl and/or aryloxide groups. The titanosiloxane polymer may be linear, branched, or cross-linked in structure, the titanium being partially cross-linked with the silicon through Si-0-Ti-O-Si bonding, Titanosiloxane polymers, such as those described in US 5,759,945, are particulariy suitable. The titanium-containing polymers, such as the titanosiloxanes, can be obtained commercially, for example, from Gelest, Inc, Mixed Ti and Si-containing polymers having both -O- and -(CRg)- groups in the backbone may also be suitably employed.<br><br>
wherein R^ R^ and y can be selected from all of the definitions set forth hereinbefore. Note that R^is the repeating group. If R' is repeated once, the fomiula represents the dimen if R^ is repeated two or more times, the fomiula represents the polymer. Non-limiting examples of suitable titanium-containing monomers include tetrakis(trimethylsiloxy)titanium, tetrakis(triethylsiloxy)titanium, tetrakis(triethoxysiIoxy)titanium, tetrakis[tris(tert-butoxy)siloxy]titanium, and the like. Non-limiting examples of suitable titanium-containing polymers include diethoxysiloxane-ethyltitanate copolymer.<br>
Other titanium-containing compounds which can be suitably impregnated onto a support to form a disorganized titanium phase include titanium sllsesquioxane complexes    /' ■^^/ disclosed by M. Crocker etaL in Chemical Communications, 1997, pp. 2411-2412, and by ^^^_ M. Croclcer et ai. in US 5,750,741. Additionally, mixtures of any of the aforementioned   ^^ K&gt; ■<br><br>
titanium-containing compounds, complexes, monomers, dimers, and polymers may also be beneficially impregnated onto the support and may be even more preferred for providing a plurality of titanium coordination environments.<br>
The titanium compound can be applied neat, from the gas phase, or from a solvent onto the support of interest.   If a solvent is used, it can be any which solubilizes the titanium compound including, for example, aliphatic alcohols, aliphatic and aromatic hydrocariDons, and water where appropriate. After contacting the starting support with the solution containing the titanium compound, the support is dried at a temperature between O°C and 150°C, preferably between 50°C and 150°C, in a vacuum or in a stream of air or an inert gas, such as nitrogen, argon, or helium. Thereafter, the support can be used without calcination or further treatment. Alternatively after drying, the support can be calcined in air or an inert gas, such as nitrogen or helium, to a temperature between 100°C and 1000°C, preferably between 100°C and 800°C,<br>
Any combination or mixture of titanium-containing supports described hereinabove can be employed in the catalyst of this invention.<br>
The titanium-containing support may be shaped into any fomi suitable for catalyst particles, for example, beads, pellets, spheres, honeycombs, monoliths, extrudates, and films. Optionally, the titanium-containing support can be extruded with, bound to, or supported on a second support for the purpose of binding together the catalyst particles and/or improving the catalyst's strength or attrition resistance. For example, it may be desirable to prepare a thin film of the titanium-containing support on a secondary support which is shaped into a bead, pellet, or extrudate. The second support is typically inert in the process and need not contain titanium. Suitable secondary supports include carbon and any refractory oxide, such as, silica, alumina, aluminosilicates; ceramics, including ceramic cariDides and nitrides, as well as any metallic support. Generally, the quantity of second support ranges from 0 to 95 weight percent, based on the combined weight of the catalyst and second support.<br>
There is no limitation on the method of incorporating oxidized gold onto the titanium-containing support, so long as the catalyst produced exhibits activity in the hydro-oxidation process of this invention. Non-limiting examples of suitable preparation methods include deposition-precipitation, impregnation, spray-drying, ion-exchange, vapor deposition, and solid-solid reaction. Deposition-precipitafion and'impregnation are somewhat preferred. Throughout the preparation, conditions are typically chosen to minimize the reduction of oxidized gold to metallic gold. In the deposition-precipitation method the titanium-containing support Is usually contacted with a solution containing a gold compound at a temperature<br><br>
and pH sufficient to incorporate an oxidized gold compound onto the support. The synthesis conditions can be varied as a function of several parameters, for example, the specific nature of the gold compound, the concentration of the gold compound in the solution, the nature and concentration of other ionic species, such as. chloride, sodium ions, and silicate; the specific support, the pH, temperature, specific base selected, and contacting time. In the impregnation method, the support is wetted with a solution, suspension, or colloid containing a compound of oxidized gold, to the point of incipient wetness or to a point of lesser or greater wetness, as desired. Here too, the impregnation conditions can vary, for example, with the specific gold compound, its concentration in the solution or suspension, the particular support, and the impregnation temperature. The support may be treated with multiple impregnations, if desired.<br>
The temperature of the deposition-precipitation and impregnation techniques (or the ion-exchange technique, if that is used) usually ranges from ambient, taken as 21 °C, to 100°C, but other temperatures may be found to be suitable. Any gold compound can be used to prepare the gold solution or suspension for the deposition-precipitation and impregnation methods, or the ion-exchange method if that is used. Non-limiting examples of suitable gold compounds include chloroauricacid, sodium chloroaurate, potassium chloroaurate, gold cyanide, potassium gold cyanide, gold acetate, diethylamine auric acid trichloride, alkyl gold halides, preferably, alkyl gold chlorides, and alkali aurates, such as lithium aurate, sodium aurate, potassium aurate, rubidium aurate, and cesium aurate. Organo-gold compounds can also be employed. Suitable solvents include, but are not limited to, water and organic solvents, the latter including alcohols (for example, methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol), esters, ketones, and aliphatic and aromatic hydrocariDons. Mixtures of water and organic solvents are also suitably employed. Typically, where a solution is used, the molarity of the soluble gold compound ranges from 0.0001 M to the saturation point of the soluble gold compound, preferably, from 0.0005 M to 0.5 M. If an aqueous solution is used containing oxidized gold salts, the pH of the solution may be adjusted to any value between 5 and 14, preferably, with a base selected, for example, from cariDonates, borates, cartDoxylates, hydroxides, silicates, and mixtures thereof. Optionally, the solution may contain cationlc and/or anionic additives which favor stabilization of oxidized gold species, including, for example, certain promoter metal ions (for example, Li^ Mg*^, and La*^), as well as halides, sulphates, phosphates, cartDonates, borates, and cariDoxylates, such as, acetates, lactates, citrates, maleates, cinnamates, and mixtures thereof-<br><br>
For illustrative purposes, a deposition-precipitation synthesis is set forth which is suitable for preparing a preferred catalyst composition comprising oxidized gold on a titanium-containing support containing a plurality of titanium species. This description is intended for illustration only and should not be construed to limit the synthetic methods which can be used in preparing the catalyst of this invention. The titanium-containing support is contacted with an aqueous solution of a soluble gold compound, for example, chloroauric acid. The pH is typically adjusted to between 5 and 14 with any suitable base, such as, sodium hydroxide, sddium cartDonate, sodium silicate, sodium acetate, potassium carbonate, cesium hydroxide, lithium carbonate, cesium carbonate, aibidium cartDonate, or a mixture thereof. The pH is selected to facilitate, and preferably optimize, the reaction of gold ions with the support. A pH greater than 7 and less than 14 is preferred. The mixture is stin-ed under air at a temperature between 20°C and 80°C for a time ranging from 1 hour to 24 hours. At the end of this period, the solids are recovered, washed with water, the water optionally containing one or more promoter metal salts. Thereafter, the solid is dried under air at a temperature between 20°C and 120°C.<br>
As another illustration, an impregnation synthesis is set forth which is suitable for preparing a prefen-ed catalyst composition comprising oxidized gold on a titanium-containing support having a plurality of titanium species. Again, this description should not be construed to limit the method described herein. In this method, the titanium-containing support may be impregnated with an aqueous solution of a soluble gold compound, for example, chloroauric acid. The pH is typically adjusted to between 5 and 14 with any suitable base, as mentioned hereinbefore with regard to deposition-precipitation. A pH greater than 7 and less than 14 is preferred. Alternatively, the impregnation solution may be prepared with an organic solvent, for example, alcohol, or a mixture of water with an organic solvent. The gold compound and/or other salts employed need not be fully dissolved in the solvent; suspensions can be used. Thereafter, the solid is dried under air at a temperature between 20°C and 120°C to remove the solvent.<br>
The as-synthesized catalyst may be used without further treatment. Optionally, the as-synthesized catalyst may be calcined under air, or heated in an inert atmosphere, such as nitrogen. The calcination/heating temperature depends upon the particular sample, but may be varied from 100°C to 800°C, preferably, from 120°C to 750^0. Preferably, the temperature is chosen to minimize the reduction of oxidized gold to metallic gold. As an altemative, the as-synthesized catalyst may be conditioned prior to use. The conditioning comprises heating the catalyst, for example, in the oxidation reactor under an atmosphere comprising an inert gas, such as helium, and optionally, one or more compounds selected<br><br>
from hydrocarbons (for example, the olefin to be oxidized), hydrogen, and oxygen at a temperature between about ambient, taken as 21 °C, and 600°C.<br>
Optionally, the catalyst of this invention can contain a promoter metal or a combination of promoter metals. Any metal or metal ion, or combination thereof, which enhances the perfonnance of the catalyst in the oxidation process of this invention can be employed as a promoter metal. Factors contributing to increased performance include, but are not limited to, increased conversion of the olefin, increased selectivity to the olefin oxide, decreased productivity to water, and increased catalyst lifetime. Typically, the valence of the promoter metal ion(s) ranges from +1 to +7; but metallic species may also be present. Non-limiting examples of suitable promoter metals include the metals of Groups 1 through 12 of the Periodic Table of the Elements, as well as the rare earth lanthanides and actinides, as referenced in the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 75* ed., CRC Press, 1994. Preferably, the promoter metal is selected from silver, Group 1 metals including lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, and cesium; Group 2 metals, including beryllium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, and barium; the lanthanide rare earth metals, including cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, promethium, samarium, europium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, eriDium, thulium, yttertDium, and lutetium; and the actinide metals, specifically, thorium and uranium. More preferably, the promoter metal is selected from silver, magnesium, calcium, barium, eriDium, lutetium, lithium, sodium, potassium, mbidium, cesium, and combinations thereof. Preferably, the promoter metal excludes palladium, and more preferably, the promoter metal excludes a Group VIII metal, specifically, iron, cobalt, nickel, ruthenium, riiodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, and platinum. As used herein, the word "excludes" means that the total concentration of the Group VIII metal is less than 0.01 weight percent, preferably, less than 0.005 weight percent, based on the total catalyst composition.<br>
If one or more promoter metals are used, then the total quantity promoter metal(s) generally is greater than 0,001 and, preferably, greater than 0.01 weight percent, based on the total weight of the catalyst. The total quantity of promoter metal(s) is generally less than 20 and, preferably, less than 15 weight percent, based on the total weight of the catalyst. If necessary, the promoter metal(s) can be deposited onto the titanium-containing support simultaneously with tfie titanium, or alternatively, in a separate step either before or after the titanium. If necessary, the promoter metal(s) can be deposited onto the titanium-containing support simultaneously with the gold, or altematively, in a separate step either before or after gold is deposited. For the purposes of this discussion, the word "deposif will include all of the methods of deposition-precipitation, ion-exchange, and Impregnation.<br><br>
Alternatively, the promoter metal can be deposited onto a precursor form of the catalyst before the titanium is added, or after it is added, or simultaneously with the titanium. Typically, the promoter metal is deposited from an aqueous or organic solution or suspension containing a promoter metal salt and, optionally, other additives that favor the stabilization of oxidized gold species, as noted hereinbefore. Any salt of the promoter metal can be used; for example, the metal halides, such as the fluorides, chlorides, and bromides; nitrates, borates, silicates, sulfates, phosphates, carbonates, and carboxylates, particulariy the acetates, oxylates. cinnamates, lactates, maleates, citrates. Mixtures of the aforementioned salts can be used. If an organic solvent is employed, it can be any of a variety of l<nown organic solvents including for example alcohols esters ketones and aliphatic aromatic hydrocartdons. ordinarily the support is contacted with solution of promoter metal salt under conditions which are similar to those used contacting gold solution. after deposited washing optional if done wash liquid preferably contains salts desired metals. afterwards calcination air or heating in an inert gas conditioning oxidation reactor may optionally be conducted a manner that described hereinabove deposition however process any post-synthesis treatment chosen minimize reduction oxidized metallic gold.></nown>
The process of this invention can be conducted in a reactor of any conventional design suitable for gas or liquid phase processes. These designs broadly include batch, fixed-bed, transport bed, fluidized bed, moving bed, trickle bed, and shell and tube reactors, as well as continuous and intermittent flow and swing reactor designs. The olefin, hydrogen, and oxygen can be contacted together. Alternatively, the process can be conducted step-wise wherein the catalyst is first contacted with oxygen and thereafter the oxygenated catalyst is contacted with a mixture of propylene and hydrogen. Preferably, the process is conducted in the gas phase, and the reactor is designed with heat transfer features for the removal of the heat produced. Preferred reactors designed for these purposes include fixed-bed, shell and tube, fiuidized bed, and moving bed reactors, as well as swing reactors constructed from a plurality of catalyst beds connected in parallel and used in an alternating fashion.<br>
The process conditions for the oxidation described herein can vary considerably over a nonflammable and fiammable regime. It is beneficial, however, to recognize the conditions which distinguish between nonflammable and flammable mixtures of the olefin, hydrogen, and oxygen. Accordingly, a composition diagram can be constructed or consulted which for any given process temperature and pressure shows the flammable and<br><br>
non-flammable range of reactant compositions, including the diluent, if used. The more prefen-ed reactant mixtures specified hereinabove are believed to lie outside the flammable regime when the process is operated at the more preferred temperatures and pressures specified hereinbelow. Nevertheless, operation within the flammable regime is possible, as designed by one skilled in the art.<br>
Usually, the process is conducted at a temperature which is greater than about ambient, taken as 21 °C, preferably, greater than 70°C, more preferably greater than 130°C. Usually, the process is conducted at a temperature less than 300°C, preferably less than 260°C. Usually, the pressure ranges from about atmospheric to 400 psig (2,758 kPa), preferably, from 100 psig (690 kPa) to 300 psig (2,069 kPa).<br>
In flow reactors, the residence time of the reactants and the molar ratio of reactants to catalyst will be determined by the space velocity. For a gas phase process the gas houriy space velocity (GHSV) of the olefin can vary over a wide range, but typically is greater than 10 ml olefin per ml catalyst per hour (h-1), preferably greater than 100 h'\ and more preferably, greater than 1,000 h-1 Typically, the GHSV of the olefin is less than 50.000 h-1 preferably, less than 35,000 h-1 and more preferably, less than 20,000 h'\ Also, for a gas phase process the total gas houriy space velocity (GHSV) of the feedstream can vary over a wide range, but typically is greater than 10 ml gas per ml catalyst per hour (h*^), preferably, greater than 100 h-1 and more preferably, greater than 1,000 h\ Typically, the GHSV of the feedstream is less than 50,000 h-1 preferably, less than 35,000 h-1 and more preferably, less than 20,000 h-1 Likewise, for a liquid phase process the weight houriy space velocity (WHSV) of the olefin component can vary over a wide range, but typically is greater than 0.01 g olefin perg catalyst per hour (h-1), preferably, greater than 0.05 h'\ and more preferably, greater than 0.1 h-1 Typically, the WHSV of the olefin is less than 100 h"\ preferably, less than 50 h-1 and more preferably, less than 20 h-1. The gas and weight houriy space velocities of the oxygen, hydrogen, and diluent components can be detemiined from the space velocity of the olefin taking into account the relative molar ratios desired.<br>
When an olefin having at least three cartoon atoms is contacted with oxygen in the presence of hydrogen and the catalyst described hereinabove, the con*esponding olefin oxide (epoxide) is produced in good productivity. A preferred olefin oxide is propylene oxide.<br>
The conversion of olefin in the process of this invention can vary depending upon the specific process conditions employed, including the specific olefin, temperature, pressure, mole ratios, and form of the catalyst. For the purposes of this invention, the term<br><br>
"conversion" is defined as the mole percentage of olefin which reacts to form products. Typically, an olefin conversion of greater than 0.25 mole percent is achieved. Preferably, the olefin conversion is greater than 1,0 mole percent, more preferably, greater than 1.5 mole percent, and most preferably, greater than 2.0 mole percent.<br>
The selectivity to olefin oxide can vary depending upon the specific process conditions employed. For the purposes of this invention, the temn "selectivity" is defined as the mole percentage of reacted olefin which forms a particular product, desirably the olefin oxide. The process of this invention produces olefin oxides in unexpectedly high selectivity. Typically the selectivity to olefin oxide is greater than 70, preferably, greater than 80, and more preferably, greater than 90 mole percent.<br>
The productivity of the catalyst, measured as grams of propylene oxide per kilogram catalyst per hour (g PO/kg cat-h) depends upon the specific catalyst used and process conditions, such as, temperature, pressure, and feedrate. The productivity is typically greater than 30 g PO/kg cat-h, preferably, greater than 50 g PO/kg cat-h, and more preferably, greater than 100 g PO/kg cat-h.<br>
The hydrogen efficiency in the process of this invention is advantageously high. More specifically, the watenolefin oxide molar ratio is typically greater than about 1:1, but less than about 30:1, and preferably, less than about 10:1.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the catalyst of this invention exhibits evidence of an improved, long lifetime. The term "lifetime" as used herein, refers to the time measured  \ from the start of the oxidation process to the point at which the catalyst after regeneration \ has lost sufficient activity so as to render the catalyst useless, particulariy commercially, useless. As evidence of its long lifetime, the catalyst remains active for long periods of time with little deactivation. Typically, a ain time greater than 40^hpurs without catalyst deactivation has been achieved in a fixed bed reactor. Preferably, a run time greater than 100 hours without catalyst deactivation can be achieved. In more preferred embodiments, the catalyst of this invention has been run for more than 400 hours with little deactivation. The preferred run time between regenerations will depend upon the reactor design and may range from minutes for transport bed reactors to several months for fixed bed reactors.<br>
When its activity has decreased to an unacceptably low level, in preferred embodiments, the catalyst of this invention can be easily regenerated. Any catalyst regeneration method generally known to those skilled in the art can be used^with the catalyst of this invention^ provided that the catalyst is reactivated for the oxidation process described heceio. One suitable regeneration method comprises heating the deactivated catalyst at a temperature between 150°C and 500**C under an atmosphere of ^<br><br>
regeneration gas containing oxygen, hydrogen, water or mixtures thereof, and optionally an inert gas. A preferred regeneration temperature lies between 200°C and 400°C. The amounts of oxygen, hydrogen, and/or water in the regeneration can be any which effectively regenerate the catalyst. Preferably, the oxygen, hydrogen, or water comprises from 2 to 100 mole percent of the generation gas. Suitable inert gases are non-reactive and include, for example, nitrogen, helium, and argon. The time during which the catalyst is regenerated can range as short as 2 minutes to as long as several hours, for example, 20 hours at the lower regeneration temperatures.<br>
The invention will be further clarified by a consideration of the following examples,which are intended to be purely exemplary of the use of the invention. Other embodiments of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from a consideration of this specification or practice of the invention as disclosed herein.
