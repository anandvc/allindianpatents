This invention relates to an improved toggle spring device for use in railway tracks where a railway vehicle is required to move from one track to another, and, in particular, for use in a switch or crossing in a railway turnout. The present invention constitutes an improvement in or modification of what has been described and claimed in the applicant's Indian Patent No. 183370 (hereinafter referred to as the "main patent").<br>
In order that a railway vehicle, which is travelling on a track may be enabled to move to an adjoining track for operational purposes, a device called turnout comprising a pair of switches and a crossing has to be necessarily used.<br>
Each of the pair of switches consists of a stationary stock rail and a tapered machined tongue rail movably disposed against the stock rail. One end of each tongue rail is firmly fixed to the stock rail and its tapered end is moved by mechanical means so as to butt against its stock rail in order to 'close' the switch for providing a continuous vertical support for the wheels to roll on.<br>
Railway vehicles rest on axles which in turn roll on the track through two wheels rigidly connected to the ends of each axle. Each wheel has a tread portion to vertically transmit its load to the top of the rail on which it rests and a flange portion which is guided by the side of the rail along a pre-set path.<br>
When the tongue rail of one of the pair of switches is butted or closed against its corresponding stock rail, the tongue rail of the other switch gets simultaneously opened to stand away from its stock rail. In this manner, the wheel-treads of both the<br><br>
3<br>
wheels are enabled to roll on the rail-heads on which they rest, while both the wheel-flanges are provided with clear passage-ways for their onward travel.<br>
The amount of 'minimum flangeway clearance' required for the unobstructed passage of a wheel-flange depends on several factors such as track gauge, wheel gauge, worn flange thickness, gauge tolerances permitted etc. In order to achieve the minimum flangeway clearance for the smooth passage of the flange through the open switch, the end of the open tongue rail has to be given an adequate displacement or 'throw' vis-a-vis its stock rail. Due to the tapered machining of the tongue rail, the actual available flangeway clearance varies in magnitude from the free end of the tongue rail to its fixed end.<br>
While the throw usually imparted in railway switches have proved to be quite satisfactory for the past several decades, it has been observed by railway engineers in the last few years that the flangeway clearance actually available is not quite adequate in the case of very long curved switches used with the present-day 'high-speed turnouts'. As such, railway systems the world over have been adopting different solutions for ensuring the minimum flangeway clearance for the unobstructed passage of the flange through the open switches.<br>
In one of the solutions so adopted, railways have provided suitable extensions to the existing operating levers/operating machines to throw the tongue rail not only at the free end, as per usual practice, but also at the location where the available flangeway clearance is inadequate. This solution was observed to suffer from two deficiencies. One was that the existing point operating levers/machines, which were originally designed to impart a specific amount of throw only at the free end, were<br><br>
4<br>
found incapable of imparting throw at an additional location.  To overcome this snag, some railway systems have used additional operating levers/machines at the point of inadequate clearance apart from the use of levers/machines at the free end of tongue rails, as per usual practice.   This understandably adds to the cost of procurement, installation, maintenance etc of the additional levers/machines.<br>
Another solution adopted by some railways was the use of 'Toggle Spring Device' near the location where the available flangeway clearance was considered inadequate. In this solution, the two tongue rails were connected at the location of inadequate clearance to the Toggle Spring Device. When the closed tongue rail is thrown at its free end by conventional point operating levers/machines, the tongue rail shifts laterally along its entire length by varying amounts due to the lateral stiffness of the rail. Due to sucn lateral shift of tongue rail near the point of inadequate flangeway clearance, the Toggle Spring Device gels automatically activated. As a consequence, the device ensures that while one tongue rail butts properly against its stock rail, the other tongue rail stands away from its stock rail by a designed amount, thus ensuring adequate clearance for the unobstructed passage of the flange.<br>
The improved version of the Toggle Spring Device, which is the subject matter of the main patent, makes use of a device which has very few components in comparison with the known art of Toggle Spring Device. It, therefore, enables economical production, easy installation and inexpensive maintenance of the improved Toggle Spring Device as compared to device of the known art.<br>
The improved version of the Toggle Spring Device according to the main patent can also be readily used in railway turnouts where Movable Nose Crossings or<br><br>
5<br>
 Movable Wing Crossings are used in lieu of the conventional 'fixed' type of crossings. Both these versions of movable crossings are used in some advanced railway systems to cope with the nature of traffic and serve to provide a continuous vertical support to the wheel treads in the crossing region as compared to discontinuous vertical support available in conventional fixed type of crossings. The use of the said improved Toggle Spring Device ensures adequate flangeway clearance between the crossing Vee and wing rails in these movable crossings also.<br>
In the main patent there has been claimed an improved toggle spring device for use in a switch or crossing in a railway turnout, said device being locatable between moveable tongue/nose/wing rails of said switch or crossing, and connectable to said rails by means of a pair of link rods so that the device is pivotably connected to said rails, characterised in that said device comprises:<br>
(a)	a base plate fixed on the sleepers of the railway track;<br>
(b)	an abutment and a pivot housed on said base plate;<br>
(c)	a rotatable lever rod pivotably supported on said pivot;<br>
(d)	with one end of the lever rod being provided with pin-joint connections to said link rods;<br>
(e)	with the other end of said lever rod being provided with pin-joint connection to a spring rod; and<br>
(f)	with the spring rod being provided with pin-joint connection to the said abutment through a spring-support plate.<br>
One significant feature of the further improved version of the toggle spring device according to the present invention lies in use of a plurality of springs,<br><br>
6<br>
preferably three springs, in lieu of one spring used in the improved toggle spring device according to the main patent. Such changed figure ensures that even if one of the springs does not perform, as expected in the design, the remaining springs will ensure quite satisfactory performance of the device till the defective spring is replaced.<br>
Another significant feature of the further improved version of the toggle spring device according to the present invention lies in use of a large-sized roller bearing at the end of the lever rod to ensure smooth and friction-free "throw-over' of the lever rod from one extreme position to the other in order to improve the efficiency of the device.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved toggle spring device for use in a switch or crossing in a railway turnout, said device being locatable between movable tongue rails of switches or between nose/wing rails and running rails of crossings by means of a link rod so that the device is pivotably connected to said rails, said device comprising:<br>
(a)	a base plate fixed on the sleepers of the railway track;<br>
(b)	an abutment plate and a pivot housed on said base plate; and<br>
(c)	a rotatable lever rod pivotably supported on said pivot; characterized in<br>
that:<br>
said lever rod is connected at one of its ends by means of pin-joint connection to said link rod, and is provided at its other end with a roller bearing, which is adapted to roll against a front-plate of a spring box, and that said spring box is provided with a plurality of removable springs located between the front-plate and a<br><br>
7<br>
rear plate of the spring box, such that the plurality of springs are caused to be compressed and decompressed in the event of the roller bearing provided at the end of the lever rod, moving against the front face of the front plate of the spring box. Preferably, three springs are provided within the spring box. In  other  preferred  embodiments  of the  device  according  to  the  present invention:<br>
The link rod is provided with machined threads at its ends for its connection by means of nuts to appropriate brackets fastened to the tongue rails of switches or nose/wing rails of crossing.<br>
The link rod is provided at its middle with welded/bolted jaw for its connection by means of pin joint to one end of the lever rod.<br>
The abutment plate is mounted on said base plate by means of welded or bolted connection.<br>
The pivot pin is mounted on said base plate by means of welded or bolted connection.<br>
The lever rod is appropriately shaped at one of its ends to be connected to the jaw located at the middle of the link rod by means of pin connection.<br>
Studs are welded/bolted to the rear face of the front-plate and to the front face of the rear-plate of the spring box, to serve as guides for both ends of said springs against lateral displacement thereof.<br>
Bolt(s) is(are) threaded through the abutment plate for moving the rear-plate of the spring box forward or backward to adjust pre-compression of the springs, as desired.<br><br>

Referring to the drawings, Figure 1 shows in plan a railway turnout comprising pair of switches (1) and (1) and fixed type of crossing (2). Figure 1 also shows an axle (3) with two wheels, with each of the wheels having treads (4) and (4') and flanges (5) and (5'). The axle (3) does not form part of the turnout and is shown in Figure 1 in dotted lines. In the aspect shown in Figure 1, axle (3) is depicted as moving from track (T1) to the adjoining tract (T2) or vice-versa. Axle (3) can also be made to move continuously on track (T1) (without diversion to the adjoining track) by<br><br>
10<br>
altering the setting of the tongue rails at the movable ends (8) and (8'), as shown in dotted lines.<br>
Figure 2 shows in enlarged plan the pair of switches (1) and (1') shown in Figure 1.   This figure also shows axle (3) with wheel treads (4) and (4') and wheel flanges (5) and (5') in dotted lines.   The two switches comprise of stationary stock rails (6) and (6') and movable tongue rails (7) and (7'). The ends (9) and (9') of the tongue rails are firmly fixed to the stock rails whereas their tapered ends (8) and (8') are moved by mechanical means (not shown in the Figure) to  butt against or stand away from their respective stock rails.  When the tongue rail (7') is thrown away from its stock rail (6'), flangeway (10') is formed between the two rails. It will be seen from the figure that the flangeway (10') varies in its width from the free end of the tongue rail (8') to the fixed end (9') with the narrowest portion of the flangeway lying somewhere in-between. The flange (5') is enabled to travel in an unobstructed manner through the flangeway (10') as long as the width of the flangeway at the narrowest portion is not less than the minimum flangeway required from consideration of the track gauge, wheel gauge, worn-flange thickness etc.<br>
Figure 3 shows in plan a movable nose crossing used by some railway systems in turnouts. This type of crossing is distinctly different from the fixed type of crossing (2) shown in Figure 1. In Figure 3, the movable nose is marked (11), whereas (12) and (12') depict the fixed wing rails. The movable nose (11) is moved by mechanical means (not shown in the figure) to butt against the wing rail (12) or (12') at a time. A flangeway (13') is formed between the movable nose(11) and the fixed wing rail (12'), as shown in the figure, when the nose is butted against the wing rail (12).   It will be<br><br>
11<br>
seen from the figure that the flangeway (13') varies in width from one end to the other. A similar flangeway (not shown) would be formed between nose (11) and wing rail (12), if the nose (11) is butted against the wing rail (12').<br>
Figure 4 shows in plan a movable wing crossing used by some railway systems in lieu of the fixed type of crossing (2) shown in Figure 1. The fixed nose in this crossing is marked (14). The movable wing rails (15) and (15') are each butted against or moved away from the nose (14) by mechanical means (not shown in the drawing). When the movable wing rail (15) is butted against the fixed nose (14), a flangeway (13') is formed between nose (14) and wing rail (15'), as shown in the figure. It will be noted that the width of the flangeway (13') varies from one end to another. A similar flangeway (not shown) would be formed between nose (14) and wing rail (15) when the wing (15') is butted against the nose (14).<br>
Figure 5 shows in plan a pair of switches with the tongue rails (7) and (7') connected to each other near their tapered ends by means of stretcher bar (16). The point operating machine (17) 'throws' the tongue rails (7) and (7') through stretcher bar (16) in such a manner that one of the tongue rails butts against its corresponding stock rail while the other tongue rail stands away from its stock rail. When the actual flangeway clearance (10') between the tongue rail (7') and its stock rail (6') is less than the minimum flangeway clearance needed on the railway in question, some railways use an additional point operating machine (17') near the location of such low clearance to increase the flangeway gap (10'). This constitutes an aspect of the known art. In Figure 5, the additional point operating machine (17') throws the stretcher bar (16') to increase the available clearance.  The additional point operating machine (17')<br><br>
12<br>
also serves to increase the flangeway clearance (not shown) between tongue rail (7) and the stock rail (6) when the said tongue rail (7) is open.<br>
Figure 6 shows in plan a pair of switches with the tongue rails (7) and (7') connected to each other near their tapered ends by means of stretcher bar (16). The point operating lever (18) operable from a cabin (not shown), 'throws' the tongue rails (7) and (7') through stretcher bar (16) in such a manner that one of the tongue rails butts against its corresponding stock rail while the other tongue rail stands away from its stock rail. When the actual flangeway clearance (10') between the tongue rail (7') and its stock rail (6') is less than the minimum flangeway clearance needed on the railway in question, some railways use an additional point operating lever near the location of such low clearance to increase the flangeway gap. This constitutes another aspect of the known art. In Figure 6, the additional point operating lever (18') throws the stretcher bar (16') to increase the available clearance (10'). The additional lever (18') also serves to increase the flangeway clearance (not shown) between the tongue rail (7) and the stock rail (6), when the tongue rail (7) is open.<br>
Figure 7 shows toggle spring device (19), of known art, as used in switches on some railways. The toggle spring device is located between the two tongue rails (7) and (7') and connected to them by means of two link rods (20) and (20') near the location where it is required to increase the flangeway clearance to ensure smooth passage of the wheel flange.<br>
The toggle spring device (19), as per the known art comprises of a baseplate (21) fixed on the track sleepers and housing angled cranks (22, 22'). One arm of each crank (22, 22') is connected to the tongue rails (7, 7') by means of link rods (20, 20')<br><br>
13<br>
using pin-jointed connections. The centres of the cranks (22, 22') are located on pivots (23, 23') housed on the base plate (21) and are free to rotate about the pivots. The remaining arms of the cranks (22, 22') are connected to each other by means of a -spring rod (24). Stops (25, 25') provided with adjustment bolts (26, 26') limit the movement of the cranks (22, 22') upto a desired value.<br>
The tongue rails (7, 7') are connected to each other near the free ends (8, 8') by means of stretcher bar (16). The stretcher bar is thrown by means of point operating machine or point operating lever (not shown in the figure) as explained in the earlier paragraphs to close one of the switches and to open the other switch. When the tongue rail (7) is so thrown open through stretcher bar (16) near its free end (8), the tongue rail (7) shifts laterally along its entire length due to its natural stiffness. The lateral movement of the tongue rail (7) is picked up by the link rod (20) which in turn pushes one arm of the crank (22). This results in the crank (22) rotating about the pivot (23) thus compressing the spring-rod (24). When the spring-rod is so compressed by the movement of the crank (22) beyond a designed limit, the spring compression gets released suddenly, throwing the crank (22') in the opposite direction. Thereby, link rod (20') pushes tongue rail (7') to butt against its stock rail (6') closing the gap (10'). In the process, adequate flangeway clearance (not shown) is created between the stock rail (6) and the (now) open tongue rail (7).<br>
Figure 8 shows the improved toggle spring device (27), which is the subject matter of the main patent, connected to tongue rails (7) and (7') by means of link rods (20) and (20'). Toggle spring device (27) comprises a base plate (28) fixed on the track sleepers.  An abutment (29) and a pivot (30) are housed on the base plate.  The<br><br>
14<br>
abutment and pivot can be mounted on the base plate by welding or by bolted connection. A lever rod (31) rests on the pivot (30) and is free to rotate about the same. One end of the lever rod (31) is suitably shaped and connected by means of a pin-joint to the spring-rod (32). The other end of the spring rod (32) is, in turn, suitably shaped and connected by means of a pin-joint to the abutment (29). The other end of the said lever rod (31) is connected to one end of each of the link rods (20, 20') by means of pin-jointed connections, for which purpose it is appropriately shaped. The remaining ends of the link rods (20, 20') are connected to the tongue rails (7, 7') by means of pin-jointed connections.<br>
When the free end (8) of the closed tongue rail (7) is thrown by means of point operating machine or point operating lever (not shown in Figure 8), tongue rail (7) shifts laterally along its entire length due to its lateral stiffness. This movement is picked up by link rod (20) which in turn pushes lever rod (31) rotating it about the pivot (30). In the process, spring-rod (32) gets compressed. When the compression crosses a designed limit, the spring gets suddenly decompressed pushing the lever rod (31), the link rod (20') and through it the tongue rail (7') against its stock rail (6') closing the flangeway gap (10'). Thereby, the tongue rail (7') butts properly against its stock rail (6') and concurrently the required flangeway clearance (not shown) is created between the stock rail 6 and the (now) open tongue rail (7).<br>
Figure 9 shows the use of improved toggle spring device (27) of the main patent, connected to movable nose crossing through link rod (20). When the nose (11) is pushed open by means of an operating machine or operating lever (not shown in the Figure) located near its narrow end, the movement of the nose (11) along its entire<br><br>
15<br>
length due to its lateral stiffness activates the link rod (20). This in turn rotates the lever rod (31) about the pivot (30), thus compressing the spring rod (32). When the spring rod (32) gets compressed beyond a designed limit, the spring suddenly get decompressed in the same manner as explained in detail in the case of Figure 8. This throws the nose (11) against wing rail (12') closing the gap (10'). This concurrently creates adequate flangeway clearance (not shown) between the wing rail (12) and nose<br>
(11).<br>
Figure 10 shows the use of the improved toggle spring device of the main patent with movable wing crossing. The functioning of the device is more or less identical to that explained in the case of Figure 9 except that in this case it is the movement of the wing rail (15) which activates the link rod (20) instead of the nose movement explained in the case of Figure 9.<br>
A comparative study of Figure 7 showing the known art of the toggle spring device and that of Figures 8, 9 and 10 showing the improved toggle spring device according to the main patent, makes it apparent that the improved toggle spring device of the main patent is much simpler and makes use of fewer components.<br>
Figure 11 shows an embodiment of the further improved version of the toggle spring device (27/1), made of structural steel, according to the present invention. As shown, the toggle spring device (27/1) is connected to tongue rails (7) and (7') by means of a link rod (20/1) through suitable brackets (7A, 7'A) located on each of the tongue rails (7, 7') and also a suitable bracket (20A) welded/bolted in the middle of the link rod (20/1). The device (27/1) comprises a base plate (28/1) fixed on track sleepers. An abutment plate (29/1) and a pivot pin (30/1) are housed on the base plate<br><br>

(28/1).  The abutment plate and the pivot pin can be mounted on the base plate either by welding or by bolted connection.   A lever rod (31/1) rests on the pivot pin (30/1) and is free to rotate about the same.   One end of the lever rod (31/1) is connected to the middle of link rod (20/1) through the bracket (20A) located on the link rod, by means of a pin.   The other end of the link rod is provided with a roller bearing (33) which rolls against the front-face of a front-plate (32/2) of the spring box (32/1).   As shown, three springs (32/3) are located in the spring box (32/1) with the front end of the springs (32/3) resting against the rear-face of the front-plate (32/2).   The rear end of said three springs (32/3) rest against the front-face of a rear-plate (32/4) of the spring box (32/1).   Three guide studs (32/5) are welded to the rear-face of the front-plate (32/2) and to the front-face of the rear-plate (32/4), so as to serve as guides at both ends of said three springs (32/3), to prevent lateral displacement of the springs (32/3) during compression/decompression thereof  The rear-plate (32/4) is capable of being moved slightly forward or backward by turning two adjustment bolts (32/6) which  are  screwed  through  complementary holes  in  the  abutment plate  (29/1). Consequently, by turning the adjustment bolts (32/6) it is possible to increase/decrease the  pre-compression  of said  three  springs  (32/3)  in  order  to  ensure  optimum performance of the device (27/1) during its use.<br>
When the free end (8) of closed tongue rail (7) is thrown by means of point operating machine or point operating lever (not shown in Figure 11), tongue rail (7) shifts laterally along its entire length due to its lateral stiffness. This movement is picked up by the link rod (20/1) which, in turn, pushes the lever rod (31/1), thereby causing it to rotate about the pivot (30/1).  In the process, the front-plate (32/2) of the<br><br>
17<br>
spring box (32/1) compresses said three springs (32/3). When the roller bearing (33) just goes past the centre of the front-plate (32/2) of the spring box (32/1), the compression of the springs exceeds the designed limit; and said three springs (32/3) get suddenly decompressed and push the lever rod (31/1) further onward. As a result, the link rod (20/1) and the tongue rail (7') are caused to be pushed towards the stock rail (6'), thus closing flangeway gap (10'). Consequently, the tongue rail (7') bulls properly against its stock rail (6'), and concurrently the required flangeway clearance (10) (not shown in the figure) is created between the stock rail (6) and the tongue rail (7).<br>
Figures 11A to 11F show details of the component parts of the further improved version of the toggle spring device (27/1), and details of the link rod (20/1) for its connection to the tongue rails of switches/movable nose of crossing/movable wing rails of crossing. Same figures show in plan/elevation, the link rod (20/1); base plate (28/1) with abutment plate (29/1) and pivot (30/1) housed thereon; lever rod (31/1); spring box (32/1) with front-plate (32/2); three springs (32/3); rear-plate (32/4) and six guide studs (32/5).<br>
Figure 12 shows the operation of the toggle spring device (27/1) according to the present invention, when connected to movable nose crossing (11) through the link rod (20/1) by means of suitable brackets. When the nose of crossing is operated by means of point machine or point lever (not shown in the figure), the device (27/1) helps to create adequate flangeway clearance between one rail (11/1') of nose crossing and its corresponding wing rail (12') for unobstructed passage of wheel flanges through the flange-way gap (13').   Simultaneously, the device (27/1) ensures that the<br><br>
18<br>
other rail (11/1") of nose of crossing fully butts against its corresponding wing rail (12).<br>
Figure 13 shows the operation of the toggle spring device (27/1) according to the present invention, when connected to movable wing crossing (14) through the link rod (20/1) by means of suitable brackets. When the wing rails of crossing are operated by means of point machine or point lever (not shown in the figure), the device (27/1) helps to create adequate flangeway clearance between one rail (14/1') of the nose of crossing and its corresponding wing rail (15') for unobstructed passage of wheel flanges through the flange-way gap (13'). Simultaneously, the device (27/1) ensures that the other rail (14/1) of nose of crossing fully butts against its corresponding wing rail (15).<br><br>
