				<td>METHOD FOR DETERMINING MIMO TRANSMISSION TECHNIQUES, BASE STATION AND MOBILE TERMINAL<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a method for determining the appropriate combination of at least two MiMO (multiple-input multiple-output) transmission techniques for a radio link in between a transmitter and a receiver using at least \wo antennas with at least two polarisations. The invention also relates to a method for receiving a transmission over a radio link in between a transmitter and a receiver, a base station, a mobile terminal and a communication network.<br>
Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmission refers to the use of multiple antennas both on the transmitter side and on the receiver side. Beamforming is an example of a MIMO technique. In beamforming the same signal is emitted from each of the transmit antennas with appropriate phase weighting such that the signal power is maximized at the receiver output. Sometimes goin weighting is also applied to the signals of each of the transmit antennas.<br>
Space time coding is another example of a MIMO technique. Space time coding is a technique to transmit multiple copies of a data stream across a number of antennas and to exploit the various received versions of the dota to improve the reliability of data transfer. For space time coding there exists for example the Alamouti scheme which is onginally designed for two<br><br>
transmit antennas. In diversity coding techniques like space time coding a single stream is transmitted in a coded way. The signal is emitted from each of the transmit antennas using certain principles of full or near orthogonal coding. !n for example OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplex) systems an open loop transmit diversity technique, as e.g. the Alamouti scheme, con be used as space time coding or space frequency coding.<br>
Another known MIMO technique is spatial multiplexing. In spatial multiplexing a data stream is split into multiple streams and each stream is transmitted from a different transmit antenna in the same frequency channel. Therefore the space dimension is re-used or multiplexed more than once. Transmit diversity and spatial multiplexing with per antenna rate control (PARC) is another example of a MIMO technique.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the invention is to select a combination of MIMO transmission lechniques which is we!! adapted to the prevailing conditions and which is robust and simple. A further object of the invention is to provide a corresponding method for receiving a transmission, a base station, a mobile terminal and a communication network.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
These objects and other objects are solved by the features of the independent claims. Features of preferred embodiments of the invention found in the dependent claims.<br><br>
The invention provides a method for determining an appropriate combination of MIMO transmission techniques for transmission over a radio link in between o transmitter and a receiver using at least two antennas with at least tv/o polarisations. The appropriate combination is a combination of beamforming and one polarisation dependent scheme. The method for determining the appropriate combination of MIMO transmission techniques chooses a combination of beamforming and at least one of polarisation time coding or polarisation frequency coding or closed loop coherent combination of polarisation beams or polarisation multiplexing.' The appropriate combination of MIMO transmission techniques is chosen dependent on at least one of radio conditions of the radio link and relative velocity in between the transmitter and the receiver.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention the appropriate combination of MIMO transmission techniques is a combination of beamforming and exactly one of polarisation time coding or polarisation frequency coding or closed loop coherent combination of polarisation beams or polarisation multiplexing. One scheme chosen is for example a combination of beamforming and polarisation time coding or a combination of beamforming and polarisotion frequency coding. Another possible chosen combination is beamforming in combination v/ith closed loop coherent combination of polarisation beams. Another possible combination is the combination of beamforming and polarisation multiplexing. The appropriate combination of MIMO transmission techniques is chosen dependent on at least one of radio conditions of the radio link and relative velocity in between the transmitter and the receiver.<br><br>
According to another preferred embodiment of the invention the appropriate combination of MIMO transmission techniques is a combination of beamforming and more than one of polarisation time coding or polarisation frequency coding or closed loop coherent combination of polarisation beams or polarisation multiplexing. A schenne chosen is then for example a combination of beamforming and polarisation time coding and one or both of closed loop coherent combination of polarisation beam and polarisation multiplexing. Another scheme that could be chosen is for example a combination of beamforming and polarisation frequency coding and one or both of closed loop coherent combination of polarisation beam and polarisation multiplexing.<br>
A preferred antenna configuration for applying the method for determining the appropriate combination of at least two MIMO transmission techniques is a configuration where there are four antenna elements in two closely spaced cross-polarized element pairs. The space in between the two element pairs is for example half a wavelength of the radio wave used for the transmission. This antenna configuration fits into one compact radome and offers opportunities in spatial processing. The method of this invention always determines and chooses the appropriate solution for a combination of at least two MIMO transmission techniques. The combination is not fixed but adaptive to the radio conditions of the radio link and/or the relative velocity in between the transmitter and the receiver.<br>
The invention combines two or more of MIMO algorithms depending on the current signal to noise plus interference ratio (5INR) and the velocity of the mobile terminal comprising a receiver. This has the advantage that always the best suitable spatial scheme is chosen by adaptive selection.<br><br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention the information on the radio conditions of the radio link and/or the relative velocity in between the transmitter and the receiver are received at the transmitter. The information on the radio conditions of the radio link and/or the relative velocity in between the transmitter and the receiver preferably depends on the combination of the at least MiMO transmission techniques used for the transmission. According to an embodiment of the invention, the mobile terminal comprising the receiver feeds back the information on the radio conditions, e. g. an SINR estimation. For this feedback of radio conditions on the radio link the channel quality indicator (CQI) feed back values of HSDPA (High-Speed Downlink Packet Access) can for example be used. In addition or alternatively the mobile terminal comprising a receiver feeds back its estimated velocity. The estimation can for example be based on the measured maximum Doppler frequency. If it is assumed that the transmitter is comprised in a base station and that the base station is stationary then the velocity of the mobile terminal comprising in a receiver corresponds to the relative velocity in between the transmitter and the receiver. The feedback of the velocity in between the transmitter and the receiver can be quantized really roughly to save uplink transmission capacity, e. g. by just using one bit for either high speed or low speed. The choice of the quantization of the feedback depends on the chosen thresholds for the velocity. One bit for either high speed or low speed corresponds to just one threshold in between high speed and low speed. Of course the quantization can be chosen to be finer to improve the quality of the determination of the oppropriate combination of MIMO transmission techniques. As an alternative, the relative mobile station velocity can also be estimated by evaluation of the uplink signal that is transmitted from the mobile station to the bose station.<br><br>
This would reduce the amount of feedback that is required from the mobile station.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the appropriate combination of MIMO transmission techniques is one of a predefined set of appropriate combinations. According to at least one of the conditions of radio conditions and relative velocity in betw/een the transmitter and the receiver, one of the determined set of appropriate combinations is chosen.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention the set of appropriate combinations comprises three combinations. One combination is chosen for low SINR and high speed of the receiver. In this case beamforming with space time coding in between the two polarisations is chosen. In this case, beamforming with space frequency coding in between the two polarisations can also be chosen, for example for OFDM systems. Space time coding in between the two polarisations is also called polarisation time coding. Space frequency coding in between the two polarisations is also called polarisation frequency coding. Another scheme is for example chosen with low SINR and low speed of the receiver. In this case beamforming and transmit diversity is chosen. The transmit diversity combines coherently the two polarisations. The third scheme can for example be chosen when the radio link offers a high SINR. In this case beamforming and spatial multiplexing with one spatial stream per polarisation can be chosen. The spatial multiplexing with one spatial stream for polarisation is also called polarisation multiplexing. The SINR can for example be signalled back from the receiver.<br><br>
The invention also provides a method for receiving a transmission over a radio link in bet-vveen a transmitter and a receiver. The receiver sends feedback information on the radio conditions of the radio link and/or the relative velocity in between the transmitter and the receiver back to the transmitter. For the SINR estimation for example the channel quality indicator (CQI) feedback values in HSDPA of UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System) be used. For feeding back estimated velocity of the receiver the estimation can for example be based on the measured maximum Doppler frequency. The mobile terminal comprising the receiver then measures the maximum Doppler frequency and transmit back this information on the velocity to the transmitter, e. g. in the base station.As an alternative^ the relative mobile station velocity can also be estimated by evaluation of the uplink signal that istransmitted from the mobile station to the bose station. The feedback of the estimated velocity can be quantized very roughly to save uplink capacity. One quantization can for example be just using one bit for either high speed or lov/ speed with a threshold in between the high speed and the low speed zone. Of course the compensation can be chosen finer to give more accurate estimations on the velocity,<br>
The invention also relates to a transmitter for performing a method for determining the appropriate combination of at least two MIMO transmission techniques and a base station comprising that transmitter.<br>
The invention also relates to a mobile terminal comprising a receiver for performing the method for receiving a transmission over a radio link and for feeding back information on at least one of radio conditions of the radio link and relative velocity in between the transmitter and the receiver.<br><br>
The invention further relates to a communication network comprising at least one base station for performing the method for detersnintng the appropriate combination of at least two MIMO transmission techniques and preferably also further comprising a mobile terminal comprising a receiver for receiving a transmission over a radio link according to the invention.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Other characteristics and advantages of the invention will become apparent in the following detailed description of preferred embodiments of the invention illustrated by the accompanying drawings given by way of non-limiting illustrations.<br>
Figure 1 shows an antenna configuration and beams of one exomple of one polarisation,<br>
Figure 2 shows a schematic oven/iew of downlink MIMO transmission and uplink signalling, and<br>
'     Figure 3 shows an example of a selection of MIMO schemes based on SINR velocity.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Figure 1 shows an example antenna configuration well adapted to be used with the invention. It shows the configuration of four cross-polarized )     antenna elements 12, 14, 16, 18. The two pairs with ±45° polarisation direction each are separated half a wavelength of spacing. The distance of<br><br>
half a v/ove length is an advantageous distance but can be chosen differently. Such a configuration fits into one compact rodome which eases the deployments while still offering significant MIMO gains in terms of diversity multiplexing and array gains. On each polarisation direction a grid of fixed beams can be shaped by proper design of antenna weights of the elements of the corresponding polarisation direction. One beam on ono polarisation direction is called polarisation beam for the purpose of this description of the invention. The number of polarisation beams can be chosen freely according to needs. One advantageous example is to use four polarisation beams on +45" and four polarisation beams on -45" polarisation. This is a well adapted configuration to achieve a high array gain and low required feedback signalling overhead. In figure 1 are shown for example polarisation beams 22, 24, 26, and 28 and four antenna elements 12, 14, 16, and 18. The antenna elements 12 and 14 belong to I     one pair of elements and the antenna elements 16 and 18 belong to a second pair of antenna elements. The pair 12/14 is spaced apart form the pair 16/18 by a distance of half a wave length of the wove length of the radio transmission chosen.<br>
Figure 2 shows a transmitter 10 of a base station and a receiver 30 of a )     mobile terminal. The radio link 20 in the direction from the transmitter 10 and the receiver 30 is used for downlink MIMO transmission from the transmitter 10 to the receiver 30. The radio link 20 is also used for uplink feedback signalling from the receiver 30 to the transmitter 10. Based on the received power, e. g. received pilot power, on the downlink of the radio 5     link 20 the mobile terminal can calculate its best beam which is the one offering the strongest receive power. The index of the best beam is fed back to the transmitter 10 over the uplink of the radio link 20. The feedback of<br><br>
10<br>
the index of the best beam can optionally be done on a slow time scale to decrease feedback overhead. This means that fast fading is averaged out. The beam index can be signalled separately per polarisation direction. This is advantageous in the case when it follows the fast fading. The beam index can also be signalled back for the average of both polarisation directions. This is advantageous when fast fading Is averaged out. The type or contents of the feedback required on the uplink of radio link 20 depends on the MIMO transmission scheme applied on the downlink of the radio link 20. The choice in between the two techniques is a performance/overhead trade¬off. „Following the fast fading" costs feedback overhead - as feedback information has to be updated more often.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention the selection of polarisation beoms can also be based on the uplink receive signal instead of the feedback signal. In frequency division duplex systems (FDD) the fading of the uplink and downlink is uncorrelated but the angles of the main propagation path are typically the same. The direction of incoming uplink signals ot the transmitter can be estimated by algorithms. Examples for those algorithms are MUSIC (Multiple Signal Classification) or ESPRIT (Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational invoriance Techniques). For this embodiment it is )    advantageous if the pairs of antenna elements are closely spaced, half a wavelength of the applied radio signal apart. The corresponding polarisation beams ore broadly shaped. Based on estimated uplink directions the beams for downlink transmissions and the corresponding pre-coding weights can be selected.<br>
5     Figure 3 shows an example of predefined sets of appropriate combinations of at least two MIMO transmission techniques. The selection of shown<br><br>
ll<br>
combinations of MIMO transmission techniques A, B, and C is based on SINR and velocity of the receiver.<br>
The set A is used in the example shown for low SINR and high speed of the receiver. In this case beamforming together with polarisation time coding is used. For space time/frequency coding there is a coding scheme culled Alamouti scheme. This Alamouti scheme is originally designed for two transmit antennas. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention one polarisation beam on +45° polarisation direction is used instead of Alamouti antenna 1 and one polarisation beam on -45'"' is used instead for Alamouti antenna 2, Thus beamforming gain can be obtained plus additional diversity gain by Alamouti. The Alamouti coding can for example be mopped to OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplex) with space frequency block coding. This scheme can also be called polarisation frequency coding.<br>
i     In this scheme high velocities of the mobile terminal comprising the receiver are tolerated. This scheme therefore requires no additional feedback on the uplink of the radio link 20. The fast fading can be adapted properly as there is no feedback required on the uplink of the  radio link 20.<br>
The scheme B shown in Fig. 2 is the case where a set of MIMO transmission )    techniques is chosen when the SINR is low and the receiver's velocity Is low.<br>
According to set B of appropriate combinations of at least two MIMO transmission techniques beamforming is used and the closed loop transmit diversity technique is applied to the polarisation beam's concept. The some data is transmitted on the +45° polarisation beam and on the -45"<br><br>
12<br>
polarisation beam. Between the two polarisation beams a phase shift is applied in order to achieve coherent combining on the receiver's side. For this purpose the mobile sends a quantized phase information using e. g. four bits, vvhich gives the phase shift which maximizes the combined receive power of both beams at the receiver. This phase shift can be calculated at the receiver by using the channel estimates and e. g. testing all possible phase combinations in order to maximize the received signal. Alternatively, lor calculating the phase shift code book operation is possible.<br>
Set B of appropriate combinations of MIMO transmission techniques is chosen for low speeds of the receiver, as the phase shift diversity feedback sent uplink on the radio link 20 requires regular updates based on the changes of the fast fading. In set B which is chosen in the case of low SINR and low speed beamforming is therefore combined with closed loop coherent combination of polarisation beam. Scheme B benefits from beamforming and diversity gains and additionally gets the coherent combining gain of the closed loop combination of polarisation beams.<br>
Set C of appropriate combinations of at least two MIMO transmission techniques is chosen in the case of a high SINR. Scheme C is chosen if Ihe average SINR is high enough. Beamforming in combination with spatial<br>
I     multiplexing will be applied in this case. Spatial multiplexing has the<br>
advantage of doubling the maximum throughput by using two independent spatial streams. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention o transmit diversity and spatial multiplexing with per antenna rate control (PARC) is applied to the polarisation beams. Data stream 1 will be<br>
i     transmitted on the +45° polarisation beam. Data stream 2 will be<br>
transmitted on the -45° polarisation beam. A SINR information e. g. over<br><br>
13<br>
CQi information per spatial stream is fed back from the receiver to adopt the modulation and the coding schemes (MCS) on each stream. This inventive concept gives additional beamforming gain. Already existing feedback mechanisms con be used for this set C of appropriate combinations of at least two MIMO transmission techniques. The CQI information per spatial polarisation stream is used to adopt the data rates, e. g. modulation order and coding rate, on each polarisation stream.<br>
On the downlink of the radio link 20 a MIMO transmission using one of the schemes A, B, or C is performed. On the uplink of the radio link 20 the feedback signalling is performed according to the scheme A, B, or C which is used for the downlink transmission on the radio link 20. The uplink feedback signalling of radio link 20 comprises information on the SINR, signal to interference and noise ratio and/or comprises information on the velocity of the receiver. The velocity information of the receiver comprises at least the information if the velocity is high or low. The feedback signalling on the uplink of the radio link 20 further depends on the MIMO transmission scheme chosen on the downlink of the radio link 20. In the case where the above described schemes A, B, or C are applied the following possibilities exist. When scheme A is applied no additional feedback is necessary. When scheme B is applied, a diversity feedback is transmitted on the uplink of radio link 20. When scheme C is applied, a CQI feedback per polarisation stream is fed back on the uplink of the radio link 20. The CQI feedback information gives information on the SINR per polarisation stream.<br>
The invention presented is advantageously adopted to cross polarized antenna configurations. An example for an advantageous antenna<br><br>
14<br>
configuration is the configuration shown in figure 1 with 4 antennas 12, 14, 16, 1 8 at the transmitter in the base station in the cross polarized configuration shown in figure 1. On the receiver's side at the mobile terminal advantageous results can already be achieved by using tv/o antennas.<br>
The sets of combinations of MIMO transmission techniques cover operational relevant modes to diversify schemes as well as dual stream modes. The selection of the individual schemes is based on the evaluation of StNR and speed at the mobile ternninal which comprises the receiver. The concepts presented ore applicable to multi user MIMO (MU-MIMO) as well as to single user MIMO (SU-MIMO).<br>
Advantages of several different MIMO techniques are combined to achieve adoptively the proper spatial scheme using polarisations for the current situation present in between transmitter and receiver. This results in increased cell throughput of mobile communication netvv'ork. The antenna configuration for this invention is compact fitting into a compact radome. The signalling overhead is low at the same time providing gains in the downlink connection.<br><br><br>
