				<td>HCV NS-3 Serine Protease Inhibitors Technical Field<br>
This invention relates to novel inhibitors of the NS3 serine protease of the flavivirus HCV and to methods for their use in the treatment or prophylaxis of HCV.<br>
Background Art<br>
The NS3 serine protease of HCV Is a multifunctional protein which contains a serine protease domain and a RNA helicase domain. The protease cofactor NS4A, which is a relatively small protein, is absolutely required for enhanced serine protease activity. The NS3 serine protease is essential in the viral lifecycle. From analysis of the substrate binding site as revealed by X-ray crystal structure, It has been shown that the binding site of the NS3 protease is remarkably shallow and solvent exposed making small molecule inhibitor design a challenge.<br>
It is believed that two HCV protease inhibitors have entered clinical trials, namely Boehringer Ingelheim's BILN-2061 disclosed in WO 0059929 and Vertex' VX-950 disclosed in WO 0387092. A number of similar peptidomimetic HCV protease inhibitors have also been proposed in the academic and patent literature. Common for the vast majority of such prior art peptidomimetics is the presence of an L-proline derivative at the P2 position of the inhibitor and interacting with the S2 subsite of the HCV protease enzyme. In the case of BILN-2061, the L-proline is 4-substituted with a quinoline ether, whereas VX-950 has a carboyclic ring fused to the L-proline ring. Most peptidomimetics additionally comprise additional L-amino acid derivatives peptide bonded at the P3 position, with many proposed inhibitors also including additional L-amino acid derivatives extending into P4, P5 and P6.<br>
It has already become apparent that the sustained administration of BILN-2061 or VX-950 selects HCV mutants which are resistant to the respective drug, so called drug escape mutants. These drug escape mutants have characteristic mutations in the HCV protease genome, notably D168V, D168Y and/or A165S. Treatment paradigms for HCV will thus have to resemble HIV treatment, where drug escapemutations also arise readily. Accordingly, additional drugs with different resistance patterns will consistently be required to provide failing patients with treatment options, and combination therapy with multiple drugs is likely to be the norm in the future, even for first line treatment.<br>
Experience with HIV drugs, and HIV protease inhibitors in particular, has further emphasized that sub-optimal pharmacokinetics and complex dosage regimes quickly result in inadvertent compliance failures. This in turn means that the 24 hour trough concentration (minimum plasma concentration) for the respective drugs in an HIV regime frequently falls below the IC90 or ED90 threshold for large parts of the day. It is considered that a 24 hour trough level of at least the IC50, and more realistically, the IC90 or ED90 is essential to slow down the development of drug escape mutants and achieving the necessary pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism to allow such trough levels provides a stringent challenge to drug design. The strongly peptidomimetic nature of prior art HCV protease inhibitors, with multiple peptide bonds in native configurations poses pharmacokinetic hurdles to effective dosage regimes.<br>

Without in any way wishing to be bound by theory, or the ascription of tentative binding modes for specific variables, the notional concepts P1, P2, P3. and P4 as used herein are provided for convenience only and have substantially their conventional meanings, as illustrated by Schechter &amp; Berger, (1976) Biochem Biophys Res Comm 27 157-162, and denote those portions of the inhibitor believed to fill the S1, S2, S3 and S4 subsites respectively of the enzyme, where S1 is adjacent the cleavage site and S4 remote from the cleavage site. Regardless of binding mode, the components defined by Formula VI etc are intended to be within the scope of the invention. For example it is expected that capping group R16-G may interact with the S3 and S4 subsites especially when m and/or n is 0.<br>
The various embodiments of the present invention can be notionally represented as R16-G-P4-P3- P2-P1, wherein P3 and/or P4 may be absent. P1, P3 and P4 each represents a building block constituted of a derivative of a natural or unnatural amino acid, P2 is a substituted carbocyclic residue and G-R16 is a capping group. The building blocks are typically linked together by amide bonds.which are reversed relative to each other on each side of the P2 building block in the compounds of the invention,Additional aspects of the invention include a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the invention as defined above and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent therefor.<br>
The compounds and compositions of the invention have utility in methods of medical treatment or prophylaxis of HCV infections in humans. Accordingly, a further aspect of the invention is the use of a compound as defined above in therapy such as the manufacture of a medicament for the prophylaxis or treatment of flavivirus infections in humans or animals. Exemplary flavivirus include BVDV, dengue and especially HCV.<br>
In the compounds of the invention the amide bond linking the P2 and P3 together is reversed relative to the amide bond linking the P1 and P2, i.e. the amino acid derivatives, P1 and P3, on each side of the P2 scaffold are both coupled through their amino functions to the acid groups on each side of the P2 scaffold. This means that the side chains of the P3 and P4 (including the R16 cap to the extent this interacts with S3 or S4) point in the opposite direction compared to in a native peptide substrate. Another consequence of the reversed P3 and P4 amino acids is that the side chains of these amino acids are displaced one atom outwardly relative to a native peptide substrate.<br>
Change of direction of the P3 and P4 side chains in this fashion would be expected to favour non-natural D stereochemistries for the pocket filling groups (eg side chains) of P3 and/or P4 and/or R16. Indeed, such compounds are typically highly active and within the scope of the invention. However, it has been surprisingly found that even compounds of the invention bearing L-amino acid side chains at P3 and/or P4 exhibit good activity, notwithstanding that the respective entity must approach the S3 or S4 pocket from a different angle relative to a native peptide substrate. Accordingly L-stereochemistry at R11 and/or R15 and/or the corresponding configuration at R16 to mimic L stereochemistry represents a favoured aspect of the invention.<br><br>
The different angle of approach to the S3 and/or S4 pockets also has implications for the ability of the compounds of the invention to avoid resistance patterns exhibited by prior art HCV protease inhibitors which hitherto have all had a conventional peptide backbone of natural or non-natural L-amino acid residues. As with the reverse transcriptase of HIV which is notorious for quickly generating drug escape mutants under the slective pressure of antiviral therapy, the RNA dependent RNA polymerase NS5A of HCV has a very poor proof reading capacity. This in turn means that the HCV polymerase is highly error prone and it is likely that characteristic resistance patterns will arise when HCV antivirals are administered over long periods. Even before launch, it is apparent that BILN 2061 with a substantially peptidic backbone (albeit macrocyclised) and Vertex' NS3 protease inhibitor VX-950 with a linear peptide backbone at P3 and P4 quickly give rise to characteristic resistance mutations at positions 155,156'or 168 of the NS3 protease (Lin et al J Biol Chern 2004 279(17) :17808-17).<br>
A preferred group of compounds of the invention comprises those wherein P1 represents a hydrazine derivative, that is M is NRu where Ru is typically H or Ct-Csalkyl. Compounds wherein M is CR7R7' constitute a further preferred aspect of the invention.<br>

(Figure Removed)The corresponding structures wherein the J chain bonds to the carbon adjacent R7 are also favoured.'<br>
Favoured macrocyclic structures within Formula VI, wherein both of the P3 and P4 functions are absent, i.e. wherein m and n are each 0, include those of the formulae Vlhe-Vlhf below.<br>
(Figure Removed)The corresponding structures wherein the J chain bonds to the carbon adjacent R7 are also favoured.<br>
In general, in the optionally macrocyclic structures such as those illustrated above, linker J is a 3 to 10 chain atom, preferably 4 to 7 chain atom, such as 5 or 6 chain atom, saturated or partially unsaturated alkylene chain, that is an alkylene chain bearing 1 to 3 unsaturated bonds between adjacent carbons, typically one unsaturation. The length of the chain will, of course, depend on whether J extends from Rd, Rj, Rx, Ry, R11 or the carbon adjacent R7. Suitable chains are described in detail in WO 00/59929. Typically J will be dimensioned to provide a macrocycle of 13 to 16 ring atoms (including those atoms in the P1, P2 and if present P3 groups contributing to the ring). Conveniently J is dimensioned to provide a macrocycle of 14 or 15 ring atoms.<br>
Conveniently, the J chain contains one or two heteroatoms selected from: O, S, NH, NCrCe alkyl or N-C(=O)Ci-C6alkyl. More preferably, the J chain optionally contains one heteroatom selected from: NH, or N-C(=0)Ci-C6alkyI, most preferably N(Ac). Most preferably, the chain containing a nitrogen atom is saturated. In an alternative embodiment, J contains one heteroatom selected from O or S. The chain may be substituted with R14, such as H or methyl.Typically the J linker structure is saturated. Alternatively, J contains 1 to 3, preferably one double bond, typically spaced one carbon from the cycloalkyl R7 function, if present. The double bond may be cis or trans.<br>
Representative examples of J thus include pentylene, hexylene, heptylene, any of which are substituted with Ci-C6alkyl, Ci-C6haloalkyl, Ci-C6alkoxy, hydroxyl, halo, amino, oxo, thio or Ci-C6thioalkyI; penten-3-yI, hexen-4-yl, hepten-5-yl, where 3, 4 or 5 refers to a double bond between carbon atoms 3 and 4,4 and 5 etc.<br>
Convenient R7 and R7' groups include those wherein R7' is H and R7 is n-ethyl, n-propyl, cyclopropyl, cyclopropylmethyl, cyclobutyl, cyclobutylmethyl, 2,2-difluoroethyl, or mercaptomethyl. Preferred embodiments include those wherein R7 is n-propyl or 2,2-difluoroethyl.<br>
Alternative favoured configurations for R7 and R7' include those wherein Rr is H and R7 is C3-C7 cycloalkyl or Ci-C3alkylC3-C7cycloalkyl.<br>
Still further favoured configurations for R7 and R7' include those wherein R7' is H and R7 is J.<br>
Alternatively, R7 and R7' together define a spiro-cycloalkyl function, such as a spiro-cyclobutyl ring, and more preferably a spiro-cyclopropyl ring. "Spiro" in this context simply means that the cycloalkyl ring shares a single carbon atom with the peptidic backbone of the compound. The ring is substituted or unsubstituted. Preferred substituents include mono or di-substitutions with R7'a wherein R7'a is Ci-C6 alkyl, C3-Cscycloalkyl, or C2-C6 alkenyl, any of which is optionally substituted with halo.<br>
Alternatively the substituent may be a J linker as described above. Currently preferred stereochemistries for a spiro-cyclopropyl ring are defined below.Particularly preferred substituents include Rra as ethyl, vinyl, cyclopropyl (ie a spiro-cyclopropyl substituent to the "spiro" cycloalkyi ring of R7/R7'), 1-or 2-bromoethyl, 1-or 2-fluoroethyl, 2-bromovinyl or 2-fluorethyl.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention A is -CR4R4' as illustrated in detail in PCT/EP03/10595, the contents of which are incorporated by reference.<br>
Convenient R4&gt; groups thus include d-Cealkyl, such as methyl, ethyl,, propyl, ethenyl and -CHCHCHs, Alternative preferred R4' groups include aryl or heteroaryl such as optionally substituted phenyj, pyridyl, thiazolyl or benzimidazolyl or Ci-C3alkylaryl or Ci-C3alkylheteroaryl, where the alkyl moiety is methyl, ethyl, propyl, ethenyl and -CHCHCHs. Preferred aryl moieties include optionally substituted phenyl, benzothiazole and benzimidazole.<br>
Favoured R4 groups include -NHa, fluoro or chloro. Alternative preferred R4 groups include -OH and especially =O.<br>

Further building blocks, precursors of building blocks or prefabricated bigger fragments of the desired structure, can then be coupled to the growing chain, e.g. R16-G-P3+C(=O)-P2-P1-* R16-G-P3-C(=O)-P2-P1 or R16-G-P4-P3+C(=O)-P2-P1_+ R16-G-P4-P3-C(=O)-P2-P1.Coupling between two amino acids, an amino acid and a peptide, or two peptide fragments can be carried out using standard coupling procedures such as the azide method, mixed carbonic-carboxylic acid anhydride (isobutyl chloroformate) method, carbodiimide (dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, diisopropylcarbodiimide, or water-soluble carbodiimide) method, active ester (pnitrophenyl ester, N-hydroxysuccinic imido ester) method, Woodward reagent K-method, carbonyldiimidazole method, phosphorus reagents or oxidation-reduction methods. Some of these methods (especially the carbodiimide method) can be enhanced by adding 1-hydroxybenzotriazole or 4-DMAP. These coupling reactions can be performed in either solution (liquid phase) or solid phase.<br>
More explicitly, the coupling step involves the dehydrative coupling of a free carboxyl of one reactant with the free amino group of the other reactant in the present of a coupling agent to form a linking amide bond. Descriptions of such coupling agents are found in general textbooks on peptide chemistry, for example, M. Bodanszky, "Peptide Chemistry", 2nd rev ed., Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany, (1993) hereafter simply referred to as Bodanszky, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. Examples of suitable coupling agents are N,N'-dicyclohexyIcarbodiimide, 1-hydroxybenzotriazole in the presence of N,N- dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or N-ethyl-N1- [ (Sdimethylamino) propyl] carbodiimide. A practical and useful coupling agent is the commercially available (benzotriazol-1-yloxy) tris- (dimethylamino) phosphonium hexafluorophosphate, either by itself or in the present of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole or 4-DMAP. Another practical and useful coupling agent is commercially available 2-(IH-benzotriazol-1-yl)-N, N, N'.N1- tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate. Still another practical and useful coupling agent is commercially available 0-(7-azabenzotrizol-1-yl)-N, N,N', N'-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate.<br>
The coupling reaction is conducted in an inert solvent, e. g. dichloromethane, acetonitrile or dimethylformamide. An excess of a tertiary amine, e. g. diisopropylethylamine, N-methylmorpholine, N-methylpyrrolidine or 4-DMAP is added to maintain the reaction mixture at a pH of about 8. The reaction temperature usuallyranges between 0 °C and 50 "C and the reaction time usually ranges between 15 min and 24 h.<br>
The functional groups of the constituent amino acids generally must be protected during the coupling reactions to avoid formation of undesired bonds. The protecting groups that can be used are listed in Greene, "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry", John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York (1981) and "The Peptides: Analysis, Synthesis, Biology", Vol. 3, Academic Press, New York (1981), hereafter referred to simply as Greene, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
The a-carboxyl group of the C-terminal residue is usually protected as an ester that can be cleaved to give the carboxylic acid. Protecting groups that can be used include 1) alkyl esters such as methyl, trimethylsilyl and t.butyl, 2) arafkyl esters such as benzyl and substituted benzyl, or 3) esters that can be cleaved by mild base or mild reductive means such as trichloroethyl and phenacyl esters.<br>
The cc-amino group of each amino acid to be coupled is typically protected. Any protecting group known in the art can be used. Examples of such groups include: 1) acyl groups such as formyl, trifluoroacetyl, phthalyl, and p-toluenesulfonyl; 2) aromatic carbamate groups such as benzyloxycarbonyl (Gbz or Z) and substituted bensyloxycarbonyls, and 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc); 3) aliphatic carbamate groups such as tertbutyloxycarbonyl (Boc), ethoxycarbonyl, diisopropylmethoxycarbonyl, and allyloxycarbonyl; 4) cyclic alkyl carbamate groups such as cyclopentyloxycarbonyl and adamantyloxycarbonyl; 5) alkyl groups such as triphenylmethyl and benzyl; 6) triaikylsilyl such as trimethylsilyl; and 7) thiol containing groups such asphenylthiocarbonyl anddithiasuccinoyi. The preferred cc-amino protecting group is either Boc or Fmoc. Many amino acid derivatives suitably protected for peptide synthesis are commercially available.<br>
The a-ammo protecting group is cleaved prior to the next coupling step. When theBoc group is used, the methods of choice are trifluoroacetic acid, neat or in dichloromethane, or HCI in dioxane or in ethyl acetate. The resulting ammonium salt is then neutralized either prior to the coupling or in situ with basic solutions such as aqueous buffers, or tertiary amines in dichloromethane or acetonitrile or dimethylformamide. When the Fmoc group is used, the reagents of choice are piperidine or substituted piperidine in dimethylformamide, but any secondary amine can be used. The deprotection is carried out at a temperature between 0 °C and room temperature usually 20-22 °C.<br>
Any of the natural or non-natural amino acids having side chain functionalities will typically be protected during the preparation of the peptide using any of the above described groups. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the selection and use of appropriate protecting groups for these side chain functionalities depend upon the amino acid and presence of other protecting groups in the peptide. In the selection of such protecting groups it is desirable that the group is not removed during the deprotection and coupling of the a-amino group.<br>
For example, when Boc is used as the a-amino protecting group, the following side chain protecting groups are suitable: p-toluenesulfonyl (tosyl) moieties can be used to protect the amino side chain of amino acids such as Lys and Arg; acetamidomethyl, benzyl (Bn), or tert-butylsulfonyl moities can be used to protect the sulfide containing side chain of cysteine; benzyl (Bn) ethers can be used to protect the hydroxy containing side chains of serine, threonine or hydroxyproline; and benzyl esters can be used to protect the carboxy containing side chains of aspartic acid and glutamic acid.<br>
When Fmoc is chosen for the a-amine protection, usually tert. butyl based protecting groups are acceptable. For instance, Boc can be used for lysine and arginine, tertbuty! ether for serine, threonine and hydroxyproline, and tert-butyl ester for aspartic acid and glutamic acid. Triphenylmethyl (Trityl) moiety can be used to protect<br>
the sulfide containing side chain of cysteine.<br>
Once the inhibitor sequence i's completed any protecting groups are removed in whatever manner is dictated by the choice of protecting groups. These procedures are well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Introduction of the P2 substituent<br>
The R8 group can be coupled to the P2 scaffold at any convenient stage of the synthesis of compounds according to the present invention. One approach is to first couple the R8 group to the P2 scaffold and subsequently add the other desired building blocks, i.e. P1 and optionally P3 and P4. Another approach is to couple the P1, P2 and if present P3 and P4 moieties using an unsubstituted P2 scaffold and add the R8 group afterwards.<br>
Compounds wherein W is O and R8 is alkyl, Co-C3alkylcarbocycylyI, Co-Caalkylheterocycylyl can be prepared according to the procedure described by E. M. Smith et al. (J. Med. Chem. (1988), 31,875-885), as depicted in Scheme 1, which illustrates the technique with a saturated P2 scaffold wherein q1 is 0 and k is 1.(Figure Removed)Scheme 1<br>
Treatment of a compound containing an unsubstituted P2 scaffold (1a), which ca be prepared as described herein below with a base such as sodium hydride or potassium t.butoxide in a solvent like dimethylformamide followed by reaction of the resulting alkoxide with an alkylating agent, RB-X, wherein X is a suitable leaving group such as a halide, mesylate, triflate or tosylate, provides the desired substituted derivative (1b).<br>
Alternatively, if X is OH or SH, the P2 substituent can be introduced via a Mitsunobu reaction by reacting the hydroxy group of compound 1a with the desired alcohol or thiol in the presence of triphenylphosphine and an activating agent like diethyl azodicarboxylate (DEAD), diisopropyl azodicarboxylate (DIAD) or the like. (Mitsunobu, 1981, Synthesis, January, 1-28; Rano et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1995, 36, 22, 3779-3792; Krchnak et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1995, 36, 5, 6193-6196; Richter et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1994, 35, 27,4705-4706).<br>
Alcohol (1a) can alternatively be treated with phosgene thus providing the corresponding chloroformate which upon reaction with an amine, R8NH2, in the presence of a base like sodium hydrogen carbonate or triethylamine, provides carbamates i.e. W is -OC(=O)NH-, whereas reaction of alcohol (1a) with an acylating agent, R8-CO-X, like an acid anhydride or acid halide for instance the acid chloride, to provide esters, i.e. W is -OC(=O)-.<br>
Various alcohols R8-OH, and alkylating agents R8-X are described'in WO 00/09543 and WOOO/59929. An example of the synthesis wherein R8 is a substituted quinoline derivative is shown in Scheme 2.(Figure Removed)Friedel-Craft acylation of a suitable substituted aniline (2a), available either commercially or in the literature, using an acylating agent like acetyl chloride or the like in the presence of boron trichloride and aluminium trichloride in a solvent like dichloromethane provides (2b). Coupling of (2b) to a heterocyclic carboxylic acid (2c) under basic conditions, such as in pyridine, in the presence of an activating agent for the carboxylate group, for instance POCI3, followed by ring closure and dehydration under basic conditions like potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butanol provides quinoline derivative (2e). Quinoline derivative (2e) can be coupled in a Mitsunobu reaction to an alcohol as described above, or the hydroxy group can be displaced by a suitable leaving group such as a halide like chloride, bromide or iodide, by treatment of quinoline (2e) with an appropriate halogenating agent for example phosphoryl chloride or the like.<br>
variety of carboxylic acids with the general structure (2c) can be used in <br>
Scheme 3<br>
Thiourea (3c) with different alkyl substituents R' can be formed by reaction of the appropriate amine (3a) with tert-butylisothiocyanate in the presence of a base like diisopropylethylamine in a solvent like dichloromethane followed by removal of the tert- butyl group under acidic conditions. Subsequent condensation of thiourea derivative (3c) with 3-bromopyruvic acid provides the acid (3d).P2 building blocks wherein the R8 substituent is attached via an amine, amide, urea or sulphonamide, can be prepared from amino substituted carbocycles achieved for example by transforming the hydroxy group of the corresponding hydroxy derivative into an azide group for example by transforming the hydroxy group into a suitable leaving group such as a mesylate or halogen like chloride, followed by substitution of the leaving group with azide or by the use of an azide transfer agent like diphenylphosphoryl azide (DPPA). Reduction of the azide by catalytic hydrogenation or any other suitable reduction method provides the amine. The amino derivative can be reacted in a displacement reaction with an alkylating agent of the general formula R8-X wherein R8 and X are as described for scheme 1, to form P2 building blocks for use in the preparation of compounds of general formula VI, wherein W is -NH-. Reaction of the amino substituted carbocycle with an acid of the general formula R8-COOH under standard amide coupling conditions provides compounds wherein the R8 substituent is linked via an amide bond, whereas reaction of the amino substituted carbocycle with an appropriate derivative of sulphonic acid, R8-S(0)a-X where X is a leaving group for example chloride, in the presence of a base, provides sulphonamides. Compounds wherein the linkage between the cyclic scaffold and the R8 substituent is constituted of a urea group can for example be achieved by treatment of amino substituted carbocycle with phosgene to afford the corresponding chlorocarbamate followed by reaction with the desired amine. Alternatively, the amino substituted carbocycle can be reacted with the carbamoyl chloride or isocyanate of the desired R8 substituent for the formation of the urea linkage. It will be apparent that corresponding reactions will be available for P2 groups with other ring sizes and substitution pattern.<br>
Compounds wherein a heterocyclic R8 group is attached directly to the cyclic P2 scaffold i.e. W is a bond in general formula VI, can be prepared for example by using a replacement reaction wherein a suitable leaving group such as halide a or a mesylate or the like on the P2 scaffold is replaced by the desired RB group such as a heterocyclic grup. Alternatively the R8 group can be introduced by way of a<br>
Mitsunobu reaction wherein the hydroxy group of the P2 precursor is reacted with a nitrogen atom in the heterocyclic R8 group.<br>
(Figure Removed)Compounds wherein a tetrazole derivtive is attached to one of its ring carbons are conveniently prepared by building up the tetrazole moiety directly on the P2 precursor. This can be achieved for instance by transforming the hydroxy group of the P2 precursor into a cyano group followed by reaction with an azide reagent like sodium azide. Triazole derivatives can also be built up directly on the P2 precursor for example by transforming the hydroxy group of the P2 precursor into an azide group followed by a 3+2 cycloaddition reaction of the afforded azide and a suitable alkyne derivative.<br>
Structurally diverse tetrazoles for use in the above described substitution or Mitsunobu reactions can be prepared by reacting commercially available nitrile compounds with sodium azide. Triazole derivatives can be prepared by reaction of an alkyne compound and trimethylsilyl azide. Useful alkyne compounds are available either commercially or they can be prepared for instance according to the Sonogashira reaction i.e. reaction of a primary alkyne, an aryl halide and triethylamine in the presence of PdCI2(PPh)3 and Cul as described for example in A. Elangovan, Y.-H. Wang, T.-l. Ho, Org. Lett., 2003, 5,1841-1844. The heterocyclic substituent can also be modified when attached to the P2 building block either before or after coupling of the P2 building block to the other building blocks.<br>
These methods and further alternatives for the preparation of compounds wherein W is a bond and R8 is an optionally substituted heterocycle are extensively described in W02004/072243.Compounds having an alternative ring size and/or position of the W-R8 substituent of the carbocyclic derivative in scheme 1 may also be used in the preparation of compounds according to the present invention.<br>
Synthesis and introduction of P1 building blocks.<br>
The amino acids used in the preparation of P1 fragments are available either commercially or in the literature, see for example WO 00/09543 and WOOO/59929 from Boehringer-lngelheim or US2004/0048802 from BMS.<br>
Scheme 4 shows an example of the preparation of a sulphonamide derivative to be used as a P1 building block, and the subsequent coupling to a P2 building block. (Figure Removed)Scheme 6<br>
The sulphonamide group can be introduced on a suitably protected amino acid (4a) by treatment of the amino acid with a coupling agent, for example N,N'-carbonyldiimidazole (GDI) or the like, in a solvent like THF followed by reaction with the desired sulphonamide (6b) in the presence of a strong base such as 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU). Alternatively the amino acid can be treated with the desired sulphonamide (4b) in the presence of a base like diisopropyl ethylamine followed by treatment with a coupling agent like PyBOP® to effect theintroduction of the sulphonamide group.-Removal of the amino protecting group by standard methods and subsequent coupling to a P2 building block, prepared as described below, using standard methods for amide bond formation, like using a coupling agent such as O-tT-azabenzotriazol-l-yO-N.N.N'.N'-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HATU) in the presence of a base such as diisopropylamine in a solvent like dimethylformamide, gives 4e. Alternatively, the sulphonamide group can be introduced at a later stage of the synthesis, for example as the last step. In this case an amino acid with the reversed protection pattern, i.e. with an unprotected amino function and protected acid function, is coupled the acid function of the P2 building block using standard peptide coupling conditions for example as described above. Removal of the acid protection group, using the appropriate conditions for the present protection group, followed by coupling of the sulphonamide as described above then yields compound 4e .<br>
P1 building blocks for the preparation of compounds according to general formula VI wherein A is an ester or an amide can be prepared by reacting amino acid (4a) with the appropriate amine or alcohol respectively under standard conditions for amide or ester formation. Compounds according to general formula I wherein A is CR4R4' can be prepared by coupling of the appropriate P1 building block to the P2 building block as described in Oscarsson et af Bioorg Med Chem 2003 11(13) 2955-2963 and PCT/EP03/10595 filed 23.09.2003, the contents of which are incorporated by reference.<br>
Compounds comprising an azapeptide P1 residue, i.e. M is NRu in general formula VI can be prepared by using a suitable P1 aza-amino acyl moiety in the coupling to the P2 fragment. The preparation of aza-amino acyl moieties is described by M. D. Bailey et al. in J. Med. Chem., 47, (2004), 3788-3799, and an example is shown in scheme 5.<br>
(Figure Removed)Scheme 5<br>
Incorporation of the appropriate N-linked side chain, Ru, on commercially available tert-butylhydrazine can be performed for example by a reductive amination reaction with the appropriate aldehyde or ketone as described in scheme 19 below which produces the N-alkylated carbazate (5a). Condensation of 5a with a desired chloroformate in the presence of a base like triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine in a solvent like THF provides 5b. The R1' moiety can then optionally be removed using the appropriate conditions depending on the specific R1', such as catalytic hydrogenation for R1' being benzyl, which gives the corresponding acids. Subsequent reaction of the afforded acid with a desired sulphonamide derivative as described in scheme 4 yields sulphonamide capped building blocks. Alternatively, reaction of carbazate 5a with an isocyanate, R3-N=C=O, provides building blocks for the preparation of compounds according to general formula VI wherein M is NRu and A is CONHR3.<br>

Alternatively, reaction of amino acid (6a) with a compound of general formula R16-X where R16 is as defined above and X is a leaving group such as a halide, in the presence of a base like cesium carbonate or silver (I) oxide provides esters, i.e. G is O (6b), On the other hand, amino acid (6a) can be coupled to a second, suitably O-protected, amino acid (6d) using standard peptide coupling conditions as described above, providing (6e). Displacement of the ester group with a suitable capping group (6b) provides fragment (6f) useful for the preparation of compounds according to the present invention wherein m and n are 1.<br>
When G is N-Ry, the capped P3 or P2 building block can also be prepared on solid support as exemplified in Scheme 7.(Figure Removed)Scheme 7<br>
An appropriate N-protected, for example Boc protected, amino acid (7a) can be immobilized on a solid support, here exemplified by Agronaut resin PS-TFP, by reacting the amino acid with the desired solid support in the presence of coupling reagent like N,N'-diisopropylcarbodiimide and a base like DMAP in a solvent like dichloromethane and dimethylformamide.

Lactone opening of (8d) with for example lithium hydroxide provides the acid which subsequently can be coupled to the arnino group of a P1 building block or a precursor of a desired P1 fragment (8e), using conventional peptide coupling conditions.

Formation of the macrocycle can then be carried out via an olefin metathesis reaction using a Ru-based catalyst such as the one reported by Miller, S.J., Blackwell, H.E.; Grubbs, R.H. J. Am, Chem. Soc. 118, (1996), 9606-9614, Kingsbury, J. S., Harrity, J. P. A., Bonitatebus, P. J., Hoveyda, A. H., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 121, (1999), 791-799 and Huang et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 121, (1999), 2674-2678. It will also be recognized that catalysts containing other transition metals such as Mo can be used for this reaction. Optionally the double bond is reduced and/or the ethyl ester is hydrolysed by standard hydrogenation and/or hydrolysation methods respectively well known in the art. Alternatively the methyl ester can be selectively hydrolysed followed by coupling of a R16-G-P4 building block by standard peptide coupling conditions. The macrocyclisation step described in Scheme 17 can also be applied to the corresponding carbocyclic analogues described above. When the linker contains anitrogen atom the ring closure can be carried out by reductive amination as described in WOOO/59929.<br>
Macrocyclic compounds without the cyclopropyl moiety in the P1 part, i.e the macrocyclic ring extends directly from the peptidic backbone at the carbon adjacent R7, can be prepared using the methods described herein. An example wherein a. 5 membered cycloalkyl derivative is used as the P2 scaffold is shown in scheme 18. (Figure Removed)<br>
Scheme 18<br>
Coupling of a suitable allylglycine derivative (18a), to the acid function of the P2 scaffold (18b) using standard peptide coupling conditions yields the amide derivative (18c)." Hydrolysis of the ester group followed by a peptide coupling reaction with the olefin substituted amino acid (18Ad) provides the amide compound (18e). A ringclosing metathesis reaction is then effected by using for example Hoveyda-Grubbs catalyst which gives the macrocyclic compound (1 8f).<br>
Even though scheme 18 shows the synthetic sequence using a P2 scaffold with an unsubstituted hydroxy group, it will be apparent that the R8 substituent can be introduced at any convenient stage of the synthesis for example as described in scheme 9 and 10 or it can be introduced after the metathesis reaction, i.e. on compound 18f, using any of the methods described herein.<br>
Building blocks to be used in the preparation of compounds wherein the macrocycle extends from the amide nitrogen in the P3 fragment /.e Rx is J in general formula VI, or in the preparation of compounds wherein the P3 and P4 fragments are absent, i.e. m and n are 0 and G is NRj in general formula VI, can typically be prepared as outlined in scheme 1 8B. (Figure Removed)<br>
Scheme 18B<br>
Carbamate 18Ba, which is commercially available or is readily prepared for instance by reaction of the desired alkyl amine with di-tert-butyl dicarbonate, can be reacted with an appropriate'co-unsaturated alcohol under Mitsunobu conditions to provide the alkylated carbamate (18Bb). Subjection of 18Bb to acidic conditions like for example treatment with trifluoroacetic acid in a solvent like dichloromethane gives the free amine (18Bc) which can be. finked to a P2 fragment using any of the previously described strategies.<br>
Macrocyclic structures containing a hydrazine group i.e. T is NRd or m and n are 0 and G is NRjNRj, in general formula VI, can be prepared by linking a suitably N-alkylated carbazate derivative to the P2 fragment. Alkylated carbazate derivatives can be prepared, for example, as described in Scheme 1 9.(Figure Removed)Scheme 19<br>
Oxidation of the appropriate afcohol (19a) effected by a suitable oxidation method like for example with N-methyl morpholine oxide and tetrapropylammonium perruthenate in a solvent like dichloromethane provides aldehyde (19b). Reductive alkylation of tert-butyl carbazate with the afforded aldehyde gives the desired N-alkylated building block (19c). Alternatively, any desired hydrazine derivative such as morpholin-1-ylamine, piperidin-1-ylamine or the like can be used Instead of tert-butyl carbazate in the reaction with aldehyde 19b.<br>
Scheme 20 illustrates synthetic sequences to building blocks suitable for the preparation of compounds wherein the "outer" nitrogen of the hydrazine group is alkylated, either with an w-unsaturated alkyl chain appropriate for subsequent macrocycle formation or with any other suitable alkyl group.Reaction of a suitably protected hycfrazine derivative, for example (1,3-dioxo-1,3-dihydro-isonidol-2-yl)-carbamic acid tert-butyl ester (20a), which can easily be prepared by a person skilled in the art, with a desired alcohol, R-OH, under Mitsunobu conditions provides N-alkylated hydrazine compound (20b). Removal of the phtalimido group effected by treatment with hydrazine or a derivative thereof like hydrazine hydrate or hydrazine acetate provides the carbazate (20c). The afforded primary amine can then either be be coupled to any desired P2 fragment using any of the methods previously described to give 20d or alternatively it can be further alkylated using for example the reductive amination method described in scheme 19 followed by coupling to a P2 fragment as previously described to give 20.<br>
Scheme 21 exemplifies the coupling of a hydrazine containing P3 building block to a cyclopentane scaffold followed by macrocyclisation. (Figure Removed)<br>
Scheme 21<br>
Coupling of the carbazate derivative (21 b) to the P2-P1 building block (21a) using standard peptide coupling conditions provides intermediate (21 c). Ring closure of (21 c) by an olefin metathesis reaction as described in scheme 18 gives the macrocyclic compound (21 d).The term "N-protecting group" or "N-protected" as used herein refers to those groups intended to protect the N-terminus of an amino acid or peptide or to protect an amino group against undesirable reactions during synthetic procedures. Commonly used N-protecting groups are disclosed in Greene, "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis" (John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1981), which is hereby incorporated by reference. N-protecting groups include acyl groups such as formyl, acetyl, propionyl, pivaloyl, t-butylacetyl, 2-chloroacetyl, 2-bromoacetyl, trifluoracetyl, trichloroacetyl, phthalyl, o-nitrophenoxyacetyl, a-chlorobutyryl, benzoyl, 4-chlorobenzoyl, 4-bromobenzoyl, 4-nitrobenzoyl, and the like; sulfonyl groups such as benzenesulfonyl, p-toluenesulfonyl, and the like, carbamate forming groups such as benzyloxycarbonyl, p-chlorobenzyl-oxycarbonyl, p-methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl, p-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl, 2-nitrobenzyl-oxycarbonyl, p-bromobenzyloxycarbonyl, 3,4-dimethoxybenzyloxy-carbonyl, 4-methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl, 2-nitro-4,5-dimethoxybenzyloxycarbonyI, 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyloxycarbonyl, 1-(p-biphenylyl)-1-methylethoxycarbonyl, a.a-dimethyl-S.S-dimethoxybenzyloxycarbonyl, benzhydryloxycarbonyl, t-butoxycarbonyl, diisopropylmethoxycarbonyl, isopropyloxycarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl, methoxycarbonyl, allyloxycarbonyl, 2,2,2-trichloroethoxycarbonyl, phenoxycarbonyl, 4-nitrophenoxycarbonyl, fluorenyl-9-methoxycarbonyl, cyclopentyloxycarbonyl, adamantyloxycarbonyl, cyclohexyloxycarbonyl, phenylthiocarbonyl, and the like; alkyl gropus such as benzyl, triphenylmethyl, benzyloxymethyl and the like; and silyl groups such as trimethylsilyl and the like. Favoured N-protecting groups include Fmoc, formyl, acetyl, benzoyl, pivaloyl, t-butylacetyl, phenylsulfonyl, benzyl, t-butoxycarbonyl (BOG) and benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz).<br>
Hydroxy protecting group as used herein refers to a substituent which protects hydroxyl groups against undesirable reactions during synthetic procedures such as those O-protecting groups disclosed in Greene, "Protective Groups In Organic Synthesis," (John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York (1981)). Hydroxy protecting groups comprise substituted methyl ethers, for example, methoxy methyl, benzyloxymethyl, 2-methoxyethoxymethyl, 2-(trimethy!siiyl)ethoxymethyl, t-butyl and other lower alkylethers, such as isopropyl, ethyl and especially methyl, benzyl and triphenylmethyl; tetrahydropyranyi ethers; substituted ethyl ethers, for example, 2,2,2-trichloroethyl; silyl ethers, for example, trimethytsilyl, t-butyldimethylsilyl and t-butyldiphenylsilyl; and esters prepared by reacting the hydroxyl group with a carboxylic acid, for example, acetate, propionate, benzoate and the like.<br>
In treating conditions caused by fiavivirus such as HCV, the compounds of formula VI are typically administered in an amount to achieve a plasma level of around 100 to 5000 nM, such as 300 to 2000 nM. This corresponds to a dosage rate, depending on the bioavailability of the formulation, of the order 0.01 to 10 mg/kg/day, preferably 0.1 to 2 mg/kg/day. A typical dosage rate for a normal adult will be around 0.05 to 5 g per day, preferably 0.1 to 2 g such as 500-750 mg, in one to four dosage units per day. As with al! Pharmaceuticals, dosage rates will vary with the size and metabolic condition of the patient as well as the severity of the infection and may need to be adjusted for concomitant medications.<br>
As is good prescribing practice with antiviral therapy, the compounds of formula I are typically coadministered with other HCV therapies to avoid the generation of drug escape mutants. Examples of such additional HCV antiviral therapies include ribavirin, interferons, including pegyiated interferons. Additionally a number of nucleoside analogues and protease inhibitors are in clinical or preclinical development and will be amenable to co-administration with the compounds of the invention.<br>
Accordingly a further aspect of the invention provides a composition comprising a compound of formula I and at least one further HCV antiviral in a common dosage unit, such as any of the dosage forms described below, but especially an oralfy administered tablet, or capsule or a liquid suspension or solution for oral or injection use. A further aspect of the invention provides a method for the treatment or prophylaxis of flavivirus infection, such as HCV, comprising the sequential or simultaneous administration of a compound of formula I and at least one further HCVantiviral. A related aspect of the invention provides a patient pack comprising a first pharmaceutical composition, preferably in unit dosage form, of the compound of formula I and a second pharmaceutical composition of a second HCV antiviral, typically also in unit dosage form and generally in a separate container within the patient pack. A patient pack will conveniently also be provided with instructions printed on the package or a container therein, or on a package insert, for the simultaneous or sequential administration of the respective pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
Many HCV patients are co-infected, or prone'to superinfection, with other infectious diseases. Accordingly, a further aspect of the invention provides combination therapies comprising the compound of the invention co-formulated in the same dosage unit or co-packaged with at least one further anti-infective pharmaceutical. The compound of the invention and the at least one further antinfective are administered simultaneously or sequentially, typically at doses corresponding to the monotherapy dose for the agent concerned. However, certain antifectives can induce a synergistic response, allowing one or both of the active ingredients to be administered at a lower dose that the corresponding monotherapy. For example in drugs prone to rapid metabolism by Cyp3A4, co-dosing with the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir can allow lower dosage regimes to be administered.<br>
Typical coinfections or superinfections with HCV include hepatitis B virus or HIV. Accordingly the compound of the invention is advantageously co-administered (either in the same dosage unit, co-packaged or separately prescibed dosage unit) with at least one HIV antiviral and/or at least one HBV antiviral.<br>

These latter HBV antivirals are particularly convenient as they are also active against HIV.<br>
While it is possible for the active agent to be administered alone, it is preferable to present it as part of a pharmaceutical formulation. Such a formulation will comprise the above defined active agent together with one or more acceptable carriers or excipients and optionally other therapeutic ingredients. The carrier(s) must be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient.<br>
The formulations include those suitable for rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal and sublingual), vagina! or parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous and intradermal) administration, but preferably the formulation is an orally administered formulation. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form, e.g. tablets and sustained release capsules, and may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy.<br>
Such methods include the step of bringing into association the above defined active agent with the carrier. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active agent with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then if necessary shaping the product. The invention extends to methods for preparing a pharmaceutical composition comprising bringing a compo'und of Formula VI or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt in conjunction or association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or vehicle. If themanufacture of pharmaceutical formulations involves intimate mixing of pharmaceutical excipients and the active ingredient in salt form, then it is often preferred to use excjpients which are non-basic in nature, i.e. either acidic or neutral. Formulations for oral administration in the present invention may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active agent; as a powder or granules; as a solution or a suspension of the active agent in an aqueous liquid or a non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water in oil liquid emulsion and as a bolus etc.<br>
With regard to compositions for oral administration (e.g. tablets and capsules), the term suitable carrier includes vehicles such as common excipients e.g. binding agents, for example syrup, acacia, gelatin, sorbitol, tragacanth, polyvinylpyrrolidone (Povidone), methylcellulose, ethylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sucrose and starch; fillers and carriers, for example corn starch, gelatin, lactose, sucrose, microcrystalline cellulose, kaolin, mannitol, dicalcium phosphate, sodium chloride and alginic acid; and lubricants such as magnesium stearate, sodium stearate and other metallic stearates, stearic acid, giycerol stearate, silicone fluid, talc waxes, oils and colloidal silica. Flavouring agents such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, cherry flavouring or the like can also be used. It may be desirable to add a colouring agent to make the dosage form readily identifiable. Tablets may also be coated by methods well known in the art.<br>
A tablet may be made by compression or moulding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active agent in a free flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, surface-active or dispersing agent. Moulded tablets may be made by moulding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may be optionally be coated or scored and may be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active agentOther formulations suitable for oral administration include lozenges comprising the active agent in a flavoured base, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active agent in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active agent in a suitable liquid carrier.<br>
The compounds of formula VI can form salts which form an additional aspect of the invention. Appropriate pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of formula I include salts of organic acids, especially carboxylic acids, including but not limited to acetate, trifluoroacetate, lactate, gluconate, citrate, tartrate, maleate, malate, pantothenate, teethionate, adipate, alginate, aspartate, benzoate, butyrate, digluconate, cyclopentanate, glucoheptanate, glycerophosphate, oxalate, heptanoate, hexanoate, fumarate, nicotinate, palmoate, pectinate, 3-phenylpropionate, picrate, pivalate, proprionate, tartrate, lactobionate, pivolate, camphorate, undecanoate and succinate, organic sulphonic acids such as methanesulphonate, ethanesulphonate, 2-hydroxyethane sulphonate, camphorsulphonate, 2-napthalenesulphonate, benzenesulphonate, p-chlorobenzenesulphonate and p-toluenesulphonate; and inorganic acids such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide,.sulphate, bisulphate, hemisulphate, thiocyanate, persulphate, phosphoric and sulphonic acids. The invention further extends to salts of the compounds of formula I which may or may not be pharmaceutically acceptable, but which are useful as synthetic intermediates, the salt moiety being displaced or replaced as necessary.<br>
The invention includes prodrugs of the compounds of formula I. Prodrugs of the compounds of formula VI are those compounds which following administration to a patient release a compound of the formula VI in vivo generally following hydrolysis in the gut, liver or plasma. Typical prodrugs are pharmaceutically acceptable ethers and especially esters (including phosphate esters) of hydroxy functions, pharmaceutically acceptable amides or carbamates of amine functions or pharmaceutically acceptable esters of carboxy functions. Preferred pharmaceutically acceptable esters include alkyl esters, including acetyl, ethanoyl, butyryl, t-butyryl, stearyl and pivaloyl, phosphate esters and sulphonic esters (ie those derived from RSOaOH, where R is(Figure Removed)lower alkyl or aryl). Pharmaceutically acceptable esters include lower alkyl ethers and the ethers disclosed in WOOO/47561, especially methoxyaminoacyl and ethoxyaminoacyl.<br>
The compounds of the invention have various steric centres and the invention extends to racemates and enantiomers at each of these steric centres.<br>
Typically, the stereochemistry of the groups corresponding to the P3 and P4 side chains (ie R15 and/or R11) will correspond to an L-amino acid configuration, although the invention also extends to D-isomers at one or both of these centres. It is noteworthy that the L configuration is active notwithstanding that the nature of the E moiety means that P3 and P4 are typically translated one atom relative to a conventional polypeptide and the fact that reversal of a peptide residue, as envisaged for P3 and P4 then pitches the amine acid side chain to the opposite side compared to a conventional peptide substrate.<br>
The stereochemistry of the backbone component of the cyclic P2 group (i.e. spanning the carbonyl of the P1 amide bond and the carbonyl extending of P3 will typically correspond to L-proline. The stereochemistry of the P2 ring atom to which W is bonded is typically as shown:(Figure Removed)In compounds of the invention wherein R7 and R7' together define a spiroalkyl group, such a spiro-cycloalkyl will typically comprise an R7'a substituent on the spiro-cyclopropyl ring which is is orientated syn to A:(Figure Removed)Conveniently, the spiro carbon of such a spiro-cyclopropyl ring has the R configuration:(Figure Removed)Conveniently an R7a substituent on a spiro-cyclopropyl ring adjacent to A is in a syn orientation in the following absolute configuration:<br>

Assays<br>
The compounds of the invention are conveniently assayed for activity against the NS3 protease of flavivirus such as HCV using conventional in vitro (enzyme) assays or eel! culture assays.<br>
A useful assay is the Bartenshlager replicon assay disclosed in EP 1043399. An alternative replicon.assay is described in WO 03064416.<br>
A convenient enzyme assay involving the inhibition of fulf-length hepatitis C NS3 is essentially as described in Pofiakov, 2002 Prot Expression &amp; Purification 25 363 371.Briefly, the hydrolysis of a depsipeptide substrate, Ac-DED(Edans)EEAbu\j/[COO]ASK(Dabcyl)-NH2 (AnaSpec, San Jose, USA), is measured spectrofluorometrically in the presence of a peptide cofactor, KKGSWIVGRIVLSGK, as described by Landro, 1997 Biochem 36 9340-9348. The enzyme (1 nM) is incubated in a buffer such as 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5,10 mM DTT, 40% glyceroi, 0.1% n-octyl-p-D-glucoside, with 25 u.M cofactor and inhibitor at say 30 °C for 10 min, whereupon the reaction is initiated by addition of substrate, typically 0.5 u.M substrate. Inhibitors are typically dissolved in DMSO, sonicated for 30 s and vortexed. The solutions are generally stored at -20°C between measurements.<br>
An alternative enzyme assay is described in WO 0399316 and employs an HCV NS3/4A protease complex FRET peptide assay. The purpose of this in vitro assay is to measure the inhibition of HCV NS3 protease complexes, derived from the BMS, H77C or J416S strains, as described below, by compounds of the present invention. This assay provides an indication of how effective compounds of the present invention would be in inhibiting HCV proteolytic activity.<br>
Serum is taken from an HCV-infected patient. An engineered full-length cDNA template of the HCV genome (BMS strain) was constructed from DNA fragments obtained by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) of serum RNA and using primers selected on the basis of homology between other genotype la strains. From the determination of the entire genome sequence, a genotype I a was assigned to the HCV isolate according to the classification of Simmonds et al. (See P Simmonds, KA Rose, S Graham, SW Chan, F McOmish, BC Dow, EA Follett, PL Yap and H Marsden, J.CIin. Microbiol., 31(6), 1493-1503 (1993)). The amino acid sequence of the nonstructural region, NS2-5B, was shown to be &gt;97% identical to HCV genotype la (H77C) and 87% identical to genotype Ib (J4L6S). The infectious clones, H77C (I a genotype) and J4L6S (I b genotype) can be obtained from R. Purcell (NIH) and the sequences are published in Genbank (AAB67036, see Yanagi,M., Purcell.R.H., Emerson.S.U. and*Bukh. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 94 (16) 8738-8743 (1997);AF054247, see Yanagi.M., StClaire.M., Shapiro.M., Emerson.S.U., Purcell,R.H. and Bukhj, Virology 244 (1), 161 (1998)).<br>
The BMS, H77C and J4L6S strains are conventional for production of recombinant NS3/4A protease complexes. DMA encoding the recombinant HCV NS3/4A protease complex (amino acids 1027 to 1711) for these strains were manipulated as described by P. Gallinari et al. (see Gallinari P, Paolini C, Brennan D, Nardi C, Steinkuhler C, De Francesco R. Biochemistry. 38(17):562032, (1999)). Briefly, a three-lysine solubilizing tail was added at the 3'-end of the 3 0 NS4A coding region. The cysteine in the PI position of the NS4A-NS4B cleavage site (amino acid 1711) was changed to a glycine to avoid the proteolytic cleavage of the lysine tag. Furthermore, a cysteine to serine mutation can be introduced by PCR at amino acid position 1454 to prevent the autolytic cleavage in the NS3 helicase domain. The variant DNA fragment can be cloned in the pET21b bacterial expression vector (Novagen) and the NS3/4A complex can be expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) (Invitrogen) following the protocol described by P. Gailinari et al. (see Gailinari P, Brennan D, Nardi C, Brunetti M, Tomei L, Steinkuhler C, De Francesco R., J Viroi. 72(8):6758-69 (1998)) with modifications. Briefly, NS3/4A expression can be induced with O.SmM tsopropyl beta-D thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 22hr at 20'C. A typical fermentation (10 I) yields approximately 80g of wet cell paste. The cells are resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mL/g) consisting of 25mM N-(2Hydroxyethyl)Piperazine-N'-(2-Ethane Sulfonic acid) (HEPES), pH7.5, 20% glycerol, SOOmM Sodium Chloride (NaCI), 0.5% Triton-X100,1 ug/mL lysozyme, 5mM Magnesium Chloride (MgCI2), I ug/mL Dnasel, 5mM beta-Mercaptoethanol (BME), Protease inhibitor - Ethylenediamine Tetraacetic acid (EDTA) free (Roche), homogenized and incubated for 20 mins at VC. The homogenate is sonicated and clarified by ultra-centrifugation at 235000 g for 1 hr at 4'C.<br>
Imidazote is added to the supernatant to a fina! concentration of 15mM and the pH adjusted to 8. The crude protein extract is loaded on a Nickel Nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) column pre-equiiibrated with buffer B (25n-tM 2 0 HEPES, pH8 20% glycerol,50OmM NaCl, 0.5% Triton-XlOO, 15mM imidazole, 5mM BME). The sample is loaded at a flow rate of ImL/min. The column is washed with 15 column volumes of buffer C (same as buffer B except with 0.2% Triton-XlOO), The protein is eluted with 5 column volumes of buffer D (same as buffer C except with 200mM imidazole),<br>
NS3/4A protease complex-containing fractions are pooled and loaded on a desalting column Superdex-S200 pre-equilibrated with buffer D (25MM HEPES, pH7.5,20% glycerol, SOOmM NaCl, 0.2% Triton-XlOO, IOmM BME). Sample is loaded at a flow rate of ImUmin. NS3/4A protease complex3 0 containing fractions are pooled and concentrated to approximately 0.5mg/mL The purity of the NS3/4A protease complexes, derived from the BMS, H77C and J4L6S strains, are typically judged to be greater than 90% by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry analyses.<br>
The enzyme is generally stored at -80'C, thawed on ice and diluted prior to use in assay buffer. The substrate used for the NS3/4A protease assay, is conveniently RET S 1 (Resonance Energy Transfer Depsipeptide Substrate; AnaSpec, Inc. cat # 22991)(FRET peptide), described by Taliani etal. in Anal. Biochem. 240(2):6067 (1996). The sequence of this peptide is loosely based on the NS4A/NS4B natural cleavage site except there is an ester linkage rather than an amide bond at the cleavage site. The peptide substrate is incubated with one of the three recombinant NS3/4A complexes, in the absence or presence of a compound of the present invention, and the formation of fluorescent reaction product was followed in real time using a Cytofluor Series 4000. Useful reagents are as follow: HEPES and Glycerol (Ultrapure) can be obtained from GIBCO-BRL. Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO) is obtained from Sigma. Beta-Mercaptoethanol is obtained from Bio Rad.<br>
Assay buffer: 50m.M HEPES, pH7.5; 0. 15M NaCl; 0. l% Triton; 15 % Glycerol; 10mM BME. Substrate: 2 uM final concentration (from a 2mM stock 2 0 solution in DMSO stored at -20'C), HCV NS3/4A type la (Ib), 2-3 nM final concentration (from a 5uM stock solution in 25mM HEPES, pH7.5, 20% glycerol, 300m.M NaCl, 0.2% Triton-X100, 10mM BME}. For compounds with potencies approaching the assay limit, theassay can be made more sensitive by adding 50 ug/mL BSA to the assay buffer and/or reducing the end protease concentration to 300 pM.<br>
The assay is conveniently performed in a 96-well polystyrene black plate from Falcon. Each well contains 25ul NS3/4A protease complex in assay buffer, 50ul of a compound of the present invention in 10% DMSO/assay buffer and 25ul substrate in assay buffer. A control (no compound) is also prepared on the same assay plate. The enzyme complex is mixed with compound or control solution, typically for 1 min before initiating the enzymatic reaction by the addition of substrate. The assay plate is generally read immediately using a spectrophotometer such as a Cytofluor Series 4000 (Perspective Biosysterns). The instrument is conveniently set to read an emission of 340nm and excitation of 490nm at 25'C. Reactions are generally followed for approximately 15 minutes.<br>
The percent inhibition can be calculated with the following equation.<br>
100.-[(dFinh/dFcon)XIOO]<br>
where dF is the change in fluorescence over the linear range of the curve. A nonlinear<br>
curve fit is applied to the inhibition-concentration data, and the 50% effective<br>
concentration (IC50) is calculated by the use software such as Excel Xl-fit software<br>
using the equation:	<br>
y=A+((B-A)/(1 +((C/x)^D))).<br>
Enzyme assays conveniently utilize a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) principle to generate a spectroscopic response to an HCV NS3 serine protease catalyzed NS4A/4B cleavage event. The activity is typically measured in a continuous fluorometric assay using an excitation wavelength of 355 nm and emission wavelength of 500 nm. The initial velocity may be determined from 10 minutes continuous reading of increased fluorescence intensities as a result of the NS3 protease catalyzed cleavage event<br>

5.	Read continuously for 20 minutes at ex=355nm and em=500nm, monitoring the<br>
increased fluorescence per minute.<br>
6.	Plot the progression curve (within linear range, 8 - 10 time points) and determine<br>
the slope as an initial velocity with respect to each individual inhibitor concentration.<br>
7.	Calculate %inhibition with respect to enzyme control.Treatment of Results<br>
The result is expressed as %inhibition at a certain concentration (screen) or as a Ki<br>
value in nM or μM.<br>
Calculation of % inhibition: The initial velocity is determined from 10 minutes<br>
continuous reading of increased fluorescence intensities as a result of the NS3<br>
protease catalyzed cleavage event. The change in slope for the inhibitor compared to<br>
the enzyme control gives the % inhibition at a certain concentration.<br>
Calculation of Ki: All inhibitors are treated as if they follow the rules of competitive<br>
inhibition. The IC50 value is calculated from the inhibition values of a series of inhibitor<br>
concentrations. The calculated value is used in the following equation:<br>
K=IC50/(1+S/Km)<br>
Plotting of the graph is done by help of two calculation programs: Grafit and<br>
Graphpad<br>
Various compounds of the invention exemplified above displayed (C50s in the range 1nM to 6.9 micromolar and ED50s in the sub-micromolar to micromolar range in the above assays.<br>
Drug escape resistance pattern and rate<br>
Replicon cultures in microtitre plates can be used to determine resistance<br>
development rates and to select out drug escape mutants. The compounds being<br>
tested are added at concentrations around their ED50 using, say, 8 duplicates per<br>
concentration. After the appropriate replicon incubation period the protease activity in<br>
the supernatant or lysed cells is measured,<br>
The following procedure is followed at subsequent passages of the cultures. Virus<br>
produced at the concentration of test compound showing &gt; 50% of the protease<br>
activity of untreated infected cells (SIC, Starting Inhibitory Concentration) are<br>
passaged to fresh replicon cultures. An aliquot, say, 15μl supernatant from each of<br>
the eight duplicates are transferred to replicon cells without the test compound<br>
(control) and to cells with test compound at the same concentration, and additionally<br>
.two respectively fivefold higher concentrations. (See the table below)<br>
When the viral component of replicon propagation (for example as measured by HCV<br>
protease activity) is permitted at the highest non-toxic concentration (5 - 40 μM),<br>
2-4 parallel wells are collected and expanded to give material for sequence analysis<br>
and cross-wise resistance.<br>
Key:<br>
Viral growth permitted<br>
Virus production inhibited(Table Removed)Alternative methods for assessing activity on drug escape mutants include the preparation of mutant enzyme bearing the distinctive mutation for use in standard Ki determinations as shown above. For example WO 04/039970 describes constructions allowing access to HCV proteases bearing the 155, 156 and/or 168 drug escape mutants arising from the selective pressure of BILN-2061 and VX-950. Susch constructs can then be engineered into replicon vectors in place of the wild type protease, thereby allowing ready assessment in a cellular assay, of whether a given compound is active against a give drug escape mutant.P450 metabolism   •<br>
The metabolism of compounds of the invention through the main isoforms of the human cytochrdme system P450 are conveniently determined in baculovirus infected insect cells transfected with human cytochrome P450 cDNA (supersomes) Gentest Corp. Woburn USA.<br>
The test compounds at concentrations 0.5,5 and 50 μM are incubated in duplicate in the presence of supersomes overexpressing various cytochrome P450 isoforms, including CYP1A2 + P450 reductase, CYP2A6 + P450 reductase, CYP2C9-Arg 144 + P450 reductase, CYP2C19 + P450 reductase, CYP2D6-Val 374 + P450 reductase and CYP3A4 + P 450 reductase. Incubates contain a fixed concentration of cytochrome P450 (eg 50 pmoles) and are conducted over 1 hour. The involvement of a given isoform in the metabolism of the test compound is determined by UV HPLC chromatographically measuring the disappearance of parent compound.<br><br><br><br>
