FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a portable device for measurement of head impact points in a vehicle.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Interiors of vehicles are to be so designed as to absorb the energy of impact of the occupants of the vehicles against the interiors in a controlled manner and thus to reduce severity of bodily injuries to the occupants in the event of accidents. This is done by first establishing the head impact zone or head contact point zone within the interiors of the vehicles which the occupants are likely to hit in the event of accidents.<br>
Presently, head impact zone in a vehicle is established by computer simulation for which purpose complete layout geometry data of the vehicle are required to be fed into the computer in advance. The layout geometry data vary from vehicle to vehicle. Therefore , each time the head impact zone of a different vehicle needs to be established, the<br>
2<br><br>
layout geometry data corresponding to that vehicle are to be generated and fed into the computer. This is inconvenient and troublesome and time consuming.<br>
A servohydraulically powdered device is known for carrying out head impact tests of components in the head impact zone in vehicles. It comprises an arm pivoted at its lower end constituting the hip pivot point of the occupant in the vehicle and provided with an instrumented head at its distal end representing the head of the occupant, impact resistance of the components is tested by placing the components in the proximity of the pivoted arm and impacting the instrumented head against them. The components are likely to be damaged while being impacted. The device is heavy and complex in construction and includes a rigid foundation for installation. It is not portable and cannot be positioned in a fully built vehicle for head impact tests. It requires energy input for its operation and periodic maintenance and is very expensive. It does not measure head impact points in a vehicle.<br>

The portable device 1 as illustrated in Figs 1 to 12 of the<br>
accompanying drawings comprises	a    pan shaped    base    2<br>
comprising a pair of spaced upright studs 3 fitted on the base and provided with narrow screws 4 at the upper ends thereof. 5 is tocator plate positioned against the upper ends of the studs with the narrow screws passing through holes (not marked) in the locator plate. 6 is a L- shaped pedestal whose horizontal limb and vertical limb marked 7 and 8 respectively are channel shaped (Figs 5 and 8). The horizontal limb of the pedestal is supported on the base by placing it between the studs and tightening it against the horizontal limb with nuts 9 in thread engagement with the narrow screws, 10 is a horizontally disposed fork shaped hand whose prongs are marked 11 and 12 and the space between the two prongs is marked 13. 14 is a<br><br><br>
11<br><br><br>
support plate freely disposed against the vertical limb of the pedestal. 15 is a screw portion up and down slidably disposed in an oblong slot 16 in the vertical limb of the pedestal. The screw portion is provided with a body portion 17 having a flange 18 at the outer end thereof. The screw portion is in the thread engagement with the support plate. On turning and tightening the screw portion in the support plate the inner end of the body portion thereof bears against the vertical limb of the pedestal and holds the support plate in position against the vertical limb with the vertical limb sandwiched between them. On unscrewing and loosening the screw portion in the support plate, the body portion of the screw portion retracts from the vertical limb and the support plate is free to be moved up and down in the oblong slot in the vertical limb for height adjustment of the support plate. The flange 18 provides hand grip for turning the screw portion. One end of One hand is pivoted to the vertical limb of the pedestal by a screw member 19 freely disposed in the oblong slot 16 in the vertical limb and provided with a body portion 20 having a flange 21 at the outer end thereof. The screw member freely passes through a  groove  22  in the  support plate<br>
12<br><br>
with the inner end of the body portion of the screw member in abutment with the vertical limb of the pedestal. The one end of the hand is in thread engagement with the screw member loosely. Because the one end of the hand is in thread engagement with the screw member loosely, the hand rotates about the screw member in the vertical transverse plane and the screw member acts as the pivot. The height of the hand is adjusted by adjusting the height of the support plate on the vertical limb of the pedestal. During height adjustment of the hand, the body portion of the screw member is rotated and retracted from the vertical limb of the pedestal to facilitate movement of the support ptate with the hand and movement of the screw member in the oblong slot. On fixing the support plate against the vertical limb of the pedestal, the body portion of the screw member is rotated and advanced to enable its inner end to abut the vertical limb. The flange 21 of the body portion of the screw member provides handgrip for rotation thereof. 23 is a first circular scale graduated in degrees fitted at the pivoted end of the hand concentrically with the screw member and provided with an indicator 24 supported on the support plate. 25  is<br>
13<br><br><br>
a vertically disposed arm comprising an inner tube 26 comprising an upper portion 27 and a lower portion 28. 29 and 30 are flanges of the upper and lower portions of the inner tube respectively. The upper and lower portions of the inner tube are fitted together. The lower portion of the inner tube is disposed in the space between the prongs of the fork shaped hand and pivoted to the hand by a pivot pin 31 passing through the hand and provided with a flange 32 at one thereof. The flange of the pivot pin provides a hand grip for it. The arm also comprises an outer tube 33 slidabie on the upper portion of the inner tube. 35 is a hard material sleeve spacer internally tapered (internal taper marked 35a) and disposed below the lower end of the outer tube over the inner tube. 36 is a soft material slit washer (slit marked 37) externally tapered (external taper marked 36a) corresponding to the internal taper in the spacer and disposed below the spacer. 38 is a locknut disposed over the lower portion of the outer tube in thread engagement therewith. The lock nut is provided with an internal step 38a at the upper portion thereof at the start of the internal threading 39 therein. Knurls   at   the    outer  side   of the   lock   nut are   marked   40. On<br>
14<br><br>
turning and tightening the lock nut on the outer tube, the lock nut moves up on the outer tube and the step of the lock nut engages against the washer and pushes it up. The slit washer moves inside the spacer and radially collapses against the spacer and gets jammed against the inner tube. As a result the spacer also presses against the outer tube thereby holding the inner and outer tube together in place i.e. locking the outer tube onto the inner tube. On unscrewing and loosening the lock nut on the outer tube, the locknut moves down releasing the force on the slit washer and the spacer and the slit washer moves down to its original position and remains below the spacer. The outer tube is free to be slid up and down on the inner tube to adjust the length of the arm. The knurls on the lock nut provide a finger grip for its rotation. The upper end of the outer tube is provided with a flange 41. 42 is a head fitted on the flange 41. The head is usually made of materials such as wood or plastic or metal such as aluminium and is usually 165 mm diameter. The inner tube is provided with a linear scale marked 43. The length of the arm is adjustable by adjusting the outer  tube  on the inner  tube.    44 is  a second  circular  scale<br><br>
15<br><br>
graduated in degrees and fitted at the side of the hand concentrically with the pivot pin 31 at the lower portion of the arm. The circular scale 44 is provided with a pointer 45 supported at the lower portion of the arm. The arm is movable to and fro with respect to the vertical limb of the pedestal in the vertical longitudinal plane about the pivot pin 31 at the lower portion thereof. Due to the hand being rotatable about the screw member 19 in the vertical transverse plane, the arm also rotates with the hand in the vertical longitudinal plane. Due to the fork shape of the hand it is easy to locate and align the arm therein.<br>
The device is placed on the seat of an occupant in a vehicle and the arm with the head is tilted to touch a point on the interior of the vehicle, say P. The pivot of the arm forms the hip pivot point (H point) of the occupant. The linear scale on the arm gives the distance L between the hip pivot point of the occupant and the head impact point P. The first circular scale gives angle 0 subtended by the hand and arm with respect to the verticaHongitudinail plane i.e. the  angle of    displacement    of the hand  with the  arm<br>
16<br><br>
sideways the vertical limb in the direction of arrows M-M shown in Fig 2. The second circular scale gives the angle  subtended by the arm with respect to the vertical transverse place i.e. angle of displacement of the arm to and from the vertical limb in the direction of arrows N-N shown in Fig 1. Using the values of L, and  a parallelepiped is constructed as shown in Fig 13 of the accompanying drawings as follows:<br>
Draw axes X, Y and Z perpendicular to one another. X axis is the horizontal axis parallel to the length of the hand of the device, Y axis is the horizontal axis across the width of the hand of the device and Z axis is the vertical axis. The point of intersection of the axes is the H point of the occupant. Using the values of and and L the point P in space with respect to the X, Y and Z axes is marked. Points P and H are joined together by line PH to give length L. Point D is the projection of point P on YZ plane and the points P and D are joined together by line DP. Point B is the projection of point P on XY plane and the points P and B are joined together by line PB. Line HD is     the   projection   of line HP on the YZ plane.  Points A, C<br><br>
and E are projections of point P on the X,Y and Z axes.  Points DPBAHEC constitute the parallelepiped.<br>
t<br>
Cartesian co-ordinates of the point P are computed from the parallelepiped as follows<br>
x co-ordinate = HA = DP = HP sin = L sin  y co-ordinate = HC = HD sir <br>
= HP cos sir <br>
= L cos sin  z co-ordinate = HE = HD cos <br>
= HP cos cos <br>
= L cos :os <br>
All the head impact points in the vehicle and their location cordinates are thus determined. The head impact points are joined together to establish the head impact zone. According to the invention the location co-ordinates of all the head impact points in a head impact zone of a vehicle are precisely measured. Therefore, it is possible to calculate the   impact   resistance   and<br>
18<br><br>
design the head impact zone in a vehicle accurately. This helps to minimise severity of bodily injuries to occupants of the vehicle in the event of accidents.<br>
Instead of one mounting means, the base may comprise a plurality of mounting means provided along the length thereof to facilitate supporting of the pedestal with the arm at different locations on the base.<br>
The pedestal may be easily mounted on the base by tightening the locator plate against the horizontal limb thereof or it may be easily dismantled from the base by loosening the locator plate on the horizontal limb thereof. The hand may be easily pivoted to the vertical limb of the pedestal by assembling the support plate and the screw portion and screw member. Similarly the hand may be easily dismantled by dismantfling the support plate and screw portion and screw member. The arm may be easily pivoted to the hand with the pivot pin 31 or easily dismantled by removing the pivot pin. The device is thus easy to assemble and disassemble.<br>
19<br><br>
The device of the invention is compact light weight and portable and can be positioned within a fully built vehicle to measure the head impact points which are joined together to establish the head impact zone easily. It is simple,in construction and easy to operate. It is very easy to assemble and disassemble and easy to pack and transport or carry. The length, height and location of the arm are adjustable. Therefore, the device can be used to measure head impact points of vehicles of different sizes to establish head impact zones thereof and is thus versatile. The device does not require any energy input for its operation. It requires negligible maintenance and is economical.<br>
Instead of being channel shaped, the horizontal and vertical limbs of the pedestal may be solid or hollow sections or other geometries. The mounting means may be of a different construction. There may be two or more mounting means to support the pedestal at different locations on the base. The base may not be pan shaped and instead may be a plain plate or block or other geometry.   The<br>
20<br><br>
hand may be a solid or hollow section or other geometry instead of being fork shaped. The hand may be pivoted at one fixed position on the vertical limb of the pedestal instead of being height adjustable. The pivot of the hand may be of a different construction. The arm may be of a different construction or single piece construction and may not be length adjustable. The locking means of the arm may be of a different construction. such variations of the invention are to be construed and understood to be within the scope of the invention.<br>
