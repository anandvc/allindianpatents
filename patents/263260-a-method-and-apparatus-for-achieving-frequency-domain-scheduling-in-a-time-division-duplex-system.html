response matrix.<br>
When a base station employs a manner which bases on the channel sounding to obtain a pre-coding matrix, the base station calculates the channel impulse response matrix according to the non pre-coded uplink reference symbol transmitted by the user terminal, and then calculates the linear pre-coding matrix according to the channel impulse response matrix. When such a manner is used, both the downlink reference symbol and the data symbol, which are transmitted to the user terminal by the base station, perform the linear spatial domain pre-coding process. The user terminal does not need to know the pre-coding matrix and does not need to estimate the channel response between each of the transmitting and receiving antennas, the user terminal only needs to estimate the equivalent channel response matrix, which is combined from the pre-coding matrix and the channel matrix, in order to demodulate the data symbols, thus effectively reducing the cost of the reference symbol of the transmitting terminal while supporting any type of pre-coding operation (including beam-forming). At the same time, such an implementation method can quickly track the channel response property in real-time while not approximating the calculated pre-coding matrix, hence having no pre-coding performance loss resulted from approximation. However, the user terminal using such a method can not calculate the indication of the channel quality according to the reference symbol after the pre-coding, resulting in loss of performance in the frequency domain scheduling of the system.<br>
A base station of the prior art may also employ feedback-based manner to obtain a pre-coding matrix, wherein the infonnation on the channel state and the pre-coding matrix are fed back by a user terminal. In such a method, the user terminal needs to feed back a large quantity of information, and the fed back infonnation may be damaged and sometimes may be mistakenly transmitted, resulting in lower performance of the pre-coding/beam-forming of the system.<br>

Detailed Description of The Invention<br>
In order to solve the problem in the prior art that the frequency domain scheduling is unable to be performed when a channel sounding method is employed to obtain pre-coding matrix, a user terminal is used in the embodiment to transmit a non pre-coded uplink reference symbol to a base station; the base station obtains a channel impulse response matrix from the reference symbol and calculates a linear spatial domain pre-coding matrix corresponding to each of the downlink physical resource blocks; the base station then obtains a channel quality indicator of the downlink physical resource blocks based on the channel impulse response matrix and the linear spatial domain pre-coding matrix so as to perform the frequency domain scheduling.<br>
In the existing 3GPP EUTRA system, the downlink transmission employs the manner of<br>
5<br><br>
OFDMA multi-access based on OFDM modulation technology, while the uplink transmission employs the manner of SC-FDMA multi-access. The OFDMA refers to an OFDM system which can distinguish a user in the time domain and the frequency domain simultaneously, i.e. a transmission system where the data of multiple users can either be transmitted at different time slots or at one same time slot, the signal of each of the users is generated in the frequency domain, corresponding to the data on several sub-carriers, and then be transformed through the inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) into the time domain in order to be processed and transmitted. The SC-FDMA system refers to a single carrier transmission system which can distinguish a user at the time domain and the frequency domain, i.e. a transmission system where the data of multiple users can either be transmitted at different time slots or at one same time slot, the signal of each of the users is generated firstly in the time domain, and then transformed into the frequency domain through discrete Fourier transform (DFT) to perform sub-carrier mapping operation, etc., and subsequently undergoes an IFFT to be processed and transmitted. For a 3GPP EUTRA system, OFDMA and SC-FDMA have different time slot structures.<br>
With reference to Figure 3, there is shown a schematic view of the structure of a downlink transmission OFDMA time slot. A time slot consists of 9 OFDM symbols and one time interval (TI), wherein the time length of the TI can be 0.<br>
With reference to Figure 4, there is shown a schematic view of the structure of an uplink SC-FDMA time slot. A time slot consists of 8 long blocks LB1-LB8, 2 short blocks SB1 and SB2, time interval TI and a cyclic prefix CP before each of the long blocks or the short blocks; wherein, the long blocks LB1-LB8 are used to carry service data, the short blocks SB1 and SB2 are used to carry uplink reference symbols, and the time length of the TI can be 0. In order to enable more of the uplink user terminals to transmit uplink reference symbols within the available frequency band range, the uplink reference symbols within the available frequency band range are distributed discretely on the frequency domain.<br>
The available frequency band range refers to the frequency band range that can be used in the scheduling, that is the overlapping part of the terminal operation band width and the base station operation band width. A schematic view of the available frequency band range of the user terminal is shown in Figure 5, wherein the terminal operation band width is 10MHz, the base station operation band width is 5MHz, the central carrier of the system is located at the center of 5MHz and 1/4 of 10MHz, and the overlapping 5MHz frequency band range is the available frequency band range of the system.<br>
In order to avoid the collision between the uplink reference symbols transmitted by multiple user terminals, the system can allocate an available frequency band range to each of the user terminals, and each of the user terminals can only transmit uplink reference symbols within the available frequency band range. For example, when both of the operation band widths of the user terminal and the base station are 10MHz, the whole operation band width is divided into two equal parts, with the magnitude of each part being 5MHz, and the user terminal can only select one of the available frequency band ranges with the magnitude of 5MHz to transmit uplink reference symbols. In practice, the magnitude of an available frequency band range for a user terminal may<br>
6<br><br>
be dynamically or semi-statically adjusted according to the allocation of the uplink resources; if a large number of the uplink resources are not used in the uplink transmission and being idle, the user terminal may be allowed to transmit uplink reference symbols on the idle sub-carriers, thus expanding the available frequency band range..<br>
In the TDD system, the whole operation band width is divided into several sub-bands basing on the frequency domain, each of the sub-bands consists of multiple successive sub-carriers; combined with the division over the time domain the physical resources of the system may be further divided.<br>
For the downlink OFDMA, each of the transmission time slots in a sub-band is divided into multiple physical resource blocks (PRBs), each of the physical resource blocks is composed of M successive sub-carriers on all of the OFDM symbols in a transmission time slot, where the value of M is typically taken as 25; for the uplink SC-FDMA, a time slot is divided into multiple resource units (RUs), each of which being composed of N successive or discontinuous sub-carriers on all of the long blocks in a transmission time slot, where the value of N is typically taken as 25 as well.<br>
With reference to Figure 6, there is shown a schematic view of the division of the frequency sub-band in the embodiment, illustrating the corresponding relationship between the non pre-coded uplink reference symbols and the downlink physical resource blocks on the sub-band, where 610 denotes the non pre-coded uplink reference symbol, 620 denotes the downlink physical resource blocks out of the available frequency band range, and 630 denotes the downlink physical resource blocks within the available frequency band range. The non pre-coded uplink reference symbol 610 is distributed discretely (in the frequency domain) on both the two short blocks (SB1 and SB2) in a time slot, or distributed discretely on one short block (SB1 or SB2) in a time slot or on a long block within the available frequency band range. Each of the sub-bands may correspond to multiple physical resource blocks in multiple downlink transmission time slots. After the user terminal has transmitted a non pre-coded uplink reference symbol within the available frequency band range, the base station may obtain, via the uplink channel sounding, the channel state information of the uplink on each of the sub-bands within the available frequency band range. Due to channel reciprocity in the TDD system, i.e. in the case where the channel state information changes relatively slowly with the time (for example, low speed movements), the channel state information of the uplink is identical with that of the downlink channel in the same sub-band. In this embodiment, the pre-coding matrix used on the downlink physical resource block is calculated according to the channel state information of the uplink, wherein an uplink reference symbol transmitted in an uplink time slot may correspond to the physical resource blocks in multiple downlink time slots.<br>
With reference to Figure 7, there is shown a schematic view of the structure of the system in the embodiment, which comprises user terminal 710 and base station 720. The user terminal 710 comprises a transmitting unit 7101 and a receiving unit 7102, wherein the transmitting unit 7101 is used for transmitting non pre-coded uplink reference symbols to the base station 720; the receiving unit 7102 is used for receiving data symbols and downlink reference symbols transmitted by the base station 720, the data symbols and the downlink reference symbols are linearly pre-coded by<br>
7<br><br>
means of the pre-coding matrix. The base station 720 is used for performing the channel sounding from the non pre-coded uplink reference symbols transmitted by the user terminal 710, to obtain the channel state information of the uplink in order to perform the spatial domain linear pre-coding and the frequency domain scheduling in the downlink direction.<br>
With reference to Figure 8, there is shown a schematic view of the structure of the base station-side processing apparatus in the embodiment, which comprises an uplink channel sounder 801, a pre-coding matrix calculator 802, a channel quality indication calculator 803, a physical resource allocator 804, a data modulation and coding device 805, and a linear pre-coding device 806.<br>
The uplink channel sounder 801 is used to obtain the uplink channel impulse response matrix on each of the sub-carriers of the user terminal 710 within the available frequency band range, based on the non pre-coded uplink reference symbol transmitted by the user terminal 710, and transmit the matrix to the pre-coding matrix calculator 802 and the channel quality indication calculator 803.<br>
The pre-coding matrix calculator 802 is used to obtain the pre-coding matrix on each downlink physical resource block from the obtained uplink channel state information on each of the sub-carriers, and transmit the pre-coding matrix to the channel quality indication calculator 803, the physical resource allocator 804 and the linear pre-coding device 806.<br>
The channel quality indication calculator 803 is used to obtain the channel quality indication on each downlink physical resource block from the obtained pre-coding matrix on each downlink physical resource block and the uplink channel impulse response matrix on each of the sub-carriers, and transmit the channel quality indication to the physical resource allocator 804.<br>
The physical resource allocator 804 is used to allocate a downlink physical resource block to the user terminal 710, according to the magnitude of the data block expected to be transmitted by the user terminal 710 in the downlink direction and the obtained channel quality indication on each physical resource block, and transmit the information on the physical resource block and the corresponding channel quality indication to the data modulation and coding device 805.<br>
The data modulation and coding device 805 is used to modulate and code the data bits to form data symbols according to the channel quality indication on each downlink physical resource block allocated to the user terminal 710, and transmit the data symbols to the linear pre-coding device 806.<br>
The linear pre-coding device 806 is used to linearly pre-code both the data symbols on each downlink physical resource block and the corresponding reference symbols, according to the pre-coding matrix corresponding to each downlink physical resource block.<br>
Figure 9 is a flowchart of the process of linear spatial domain pre-coding and frequency domain scheduling in the embodiment, and the steps of the process are as follows:<br>
8<br><br><br>
9<br><br>
selected to determine the modulation and coding methods used in the uniform modulation and coding; it may also be possible to calculate a channel quality indication using the linear spatial domain pre-coding matrix corresponding to each physical resource block and the channel impulse response matrix on each sub-carrier in each physical resource block, and then use the channel quality indication to determine the method for modulation and coding.<br>
Step 907: the base station performs linear spatial pre-coding on both the data symbol of each downlink physical resource block and the corresponding reference symbol, based on the linear spatial domain pre-coding matrix corresponding to each physical resource block.<br>
When performing linear spatial domain pre-coding, the data symbol on each downlink physical resource block is transformed in a serial-parallel manner to form multiple data streams, then, after the respective reference symbol is interposed in each of the data streams, the signals to be transmitted on multiple antennas are generated through the corresponding linear spatial domain pre-coding matrix transform. If the multiple physical resource blocks allocated to the same user terminal are successive on the frequency domain and/or the time domain, for multiple data symbols and corresponding reference symbols transmitted parallel in each physical resource block, the pre-coding can be performed respectively using the linear spatial domain pre-coding matrix corresponding to every physical resource block; or the pre-coding may be performed using the average value of the linear spatial domain pre-coding matrix corresponding to each physical resource block; or based on the channel impulse response matrices on these physical resource blocks, newly calculate a linear spatial domain pre-coding matrix.<br>
In the step 901, when the user terminal is transmitting the uplink reference symbols covering the whole available frequency band range, the data symbols can be transmitted together. For example, when using the short blocks in the uplink SC-FDMA time slots to transmit the uplink reference symbols, part of the uplink reference symbols are used to demodulate the uplink data symbols; or, taking advantage of the idleness during uplink data transmission, using the long blocks in the uplink SC-FDMA time slots to transmit independent uplink reference symbols, wherein the reference symbols are not used to demodulate the uplink data symbols. When the system uses two short blocks SB1 and SB2 to transmit uplink reference symbols, it is also possible for the uplink reference symbols carried by different short blocks to cover different frequency band ranges. For example, the available frequency band range can be divided into two parts, wherein the uplink reference symbols carried by SB1 may cover the first part of the available frequency band range, and the uplink reference symbols carried by SB2 may cover the second part of the available frequency band range.<br>
In step 902, when the uplink user terminal uses one of the short blocks (SB1 or SB2) or a long block to transmit, within the available frequency band range, the uplink reference symbols discrete on the frequency domain, the base station obtains firstly the channel impulse response on the sub-carriers where the discrete point is located, and then obtains the uplink channel impulse response on each sub-carrier within the available frequency band range through frequency domain interpolation, thus completing the uplink channel detection.<br>
10<br><br>
When the uplink user terminal uses simultaneously the two short blocks (SB1 and SB2) to transmit, within the available frequency band range, the uplink reference symbols discrete in the frequency domain, if the uplink reference symbols carried by the two short blocks cover the same frequency band range (i.e. the whole available frequency band range is covered), the base station may select the uplink reference symbols carried by one of the two short blocks to perform the uplink channel sounding; or perform the uplink channel sounding using simultaneously the uplink reference symbols carried by the two short blocks, and then average the uplink channel impulse response corresponding to the two short blocks. If the uplink reference symbols carried by the two short blocks cover different frequency band ranges (i.e. each of them covers a part of the available frequency band range respectively), the uplink channel sounding may be performed within the corresponding frequency band range using respectively the uplink reference symbols carried by one of the two short blocks.<br>
In the step 903, when calculating the linear pre-coding matrix, there are two cases in the channel state information of the uplink obtained through the channel impulse response matrix: A), the obtained channel state information of the uplink is adequate; B). the obtained channel state information of the uplink is inadequate. The two cases are described as follows.<br>
A), the case where the obtained channel state information of the uplink is adequate:<br>
If the channel state information is obtained through the mutually orthogonal non pre-coded reference symbols transmitted by multiple antennas in the uplink direction of the user terminal, the information is adequate. For example, the number of the transmitting antennas of the base station is M, the number of the receiving antennas of the terminal is K, if the reference symbol is transmitted by K antennas in the uplink direction and mutually orthogonal, and are received by M antennas, the dimension of the uplink channel impulse response matrix Gj obtained from the uplink reference symbol on each sub-carrier is MXK, where j is the serial number of the sub-carrier, i.e. adequate channel state information. Transmitting mutually orthogonal uplink reference symbols at different antennas can be achieved by transmitting on different sub-carriers. For example, in SB1, the uplink reference symbols at the antenna 1 are transmitted on sub-carriers 1, 6, 11..., and the uplink reference symbols at the antenna 2 are transmitted on sub-carriers 2, 8, 12...<br>
In the case where the obtained channel state information of the uplink is adequate, the uplink channel impulse response matrix Gj of different sub-carriers in a physical resource block needs to be averaged firstly in order to obtain a channel impulse response matrix HDL corresponding to the physical resource block, and then the pre-coding matrix is calculated from the channel impulse response matrix HDL.<br>
For example, when the number of the transmitting antennas of the base station is M, the number of the receiving antennas of the user terminal is K, the number of the data streams to be transmitted is L, an uplink channel impulse response HUL may be obtained through averaging the uplink channel impulse response matrix Gj of different sub-carriers, the dimension of HUL being<br>
MXK, thus, the corresponding downlink channel impulse should be HDL=HhuL) the dimension<br>
11<br><br>
of which being KXM, and a singular value decomposition (SVD) is performed on HDL to obtain that:<br>
Hot=UAvH<br>
where U is a unitary matrix with a dimension of KxK, i.e.  UH U=1 V is a unitary matrix<br>
with a dimension of MxM, i.e. ^ VH V= 1,1 denotes a unit matrix, superscript H denotes the conjugate transpose operation of the matrix, A consists of the singular values of channel matrix HDL, with a dimension of KXM. Assume λ1 -λ2 ≥-...≥λ  is the singular value of channel<br><br><br>
B. the case where the obtained channel state information of the uplink is inadequate:<br>
12<br>
matrix HDL) wherein n min = min (M,N), then<br><br><br>
13<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The CQI value corresponding to each of the physical resource blocks is obtained using the calculated equivalent signal-to-noise ratio       eff and a predetermined estimation threshold.<br>
In practice, the frequency domain scheduling of a user terminal according to the CQI value is performed as follows:<br>
16<br>
For example, a service time slot is divided into 5 physical resource blocks, each being capable of supporting 16 modulation and coding grades, corresponding to 16 CQI values, respectively. The number of quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) symbols that can be transmitted by a physical resource block is 150, the CQI that can be supported on each physical resource block and its corresponding estimation threshold, manner of modulation, coding rate and the transmit block size (TBS) are shown in Table 2:<br><br><br><br><br>
physical resource blocks 1 and 2, to perform linear spatial domain pre-coding for the data symbols and reference symbols transmitted downlink by the user terminal.<br>
In this embodiment, the user terminal transmits an non pre-coded uplink reference symbol to the base station, the base station obtains the impulse response matrix of the channel according to the reference symbol and calculates the pre-coding matrix corresponding to each of the downlink physical resource blocks, and then obtains a channel quality indication of the downlink physical resource block in order to perform a frequency domain scheduling according to the channel impulse response matrix and the pre-coding matrix, while at the same time, performs the linear spatial domain pre-coding according to the calculated pre-coding matrix, thus solving the problem that the frequency domain scheduling is unable to be performed when the channel detection technology is employed, and avoiding the contradiction occurred in the simultaneous use of the frequency domain scheduling and the linear spatial domain pre-coding.<br>
The embodiment of the present invention is not limited to what is described above. In another embodiment of the invention, the base station transmits a non pre-coded downlink reference symbol to the user terminal, the user terminal obtains the channel impulse response matrix from the reference symbol and calculates the pre-coding matrix corresponding to each of the uplink physical resource blocks, and then obtains a channel quality indication of the uplink physical resource block, and then feeds the channel quality indication back to the base station; the base station perform a frequency domain scheduling according to the channel quality indication. When such a method is employed, after obtaining downlink channel impulse response matrix and the pre-coding matrix according to the received non pre-coded downlink reference symbol, the user terminal side obtains equivalent channel matrix corresponding to every sub-carriers for each of the uplink physical resource blocks according to its pre-coding matrix and the downlink channel impulse response matrix on every sub-carrier, predicts the signal-to-noise ratio on each of the sub-carriers after receiving in the uplink direction according to the equivalent channel matrix and the transmission signal-to-noise ratio at the user terminal side, then determines the equivalent signal-to-noise ratio and determines corresponding channel quality indication according to the equivalent signal-to-noise ratio. The method of calculating channel quality indication at the user terminal side is similar to that in the embodiment described above and do not need to be described any further.<br>
In the technical scheme of the embodiment, when there are multiple antennas at the base station, and only one antenna at the user terminal, the operation of the linear spatial domain pre-coding is degraded to the operation of transmitting beam-forming, in this case, the operation may only be performed in the downlink direction; when there is only one antenna at the base station, and multiple antennas at the terminal, the operation of the linear pre-coding is degraded to the operation of transmitting beam-forming, in this case, the operation may only be performed in the uplink direction.<br>
It is obvious to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations may be made to the present invention without departing from the spirits and scope of the invention. Thus, it is intended that all such modifications and variations are covered in the present invention if they fall<br>
