The present invention relates to a subtilase variant and to the use of subtilase variants for removal of egg stains from laundry or from hard surfaces. In particular the present invention relates to the use of a subtilase variant for removal of egg stains from laundry or from hard surfaces, where the subtilase variant comprises at least one additional amino acid residue in the active site loop (b) region from position 95 to 103 (BASBPN numbering, vide infra). These subtilase variants are useful exhibiting excellent or improved wash performance on egg stains when used in e.g cleaning or detergent compositions, such as laundry detergent compositions and dishwash composition, including automatic dishwash compositions. The present invention also relates to novel subtilase variants, to isolated DNA sequences encoding the variants expression vectors, host cells, and methods for producing and using the variants of the invention. Further, the present invention relates to cleaning and detergent compositions comprising the variants of the invention.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the detergent industry enzymes have for more than 30 years been implemented in washing formulations. Enzymes used in such formulations comprise proteases, lipases, amylases, cellulases, as well as other enzymes, or mixtures thereof. Commercially most important enzymes are proteases.<br>
An increasing number of commercially used proteases are protein engineered variants of naturally occurring wild type proteases e.g.DURAZYM  (Novo Nordisk A/S),RELASE* (Novo Nordisk A/S)<br><br>
MAXAPEM (Gist-Brocades N.V.), PURAFECT (Genencor International,<br>
Inc.).<br>
Further, a number of protease variants are described in the art.<br>
A thorough list of prior art protease variants is given in WO<br>
99/27082.<br>
However, even though a number of useful protease variants have been described, there is still a need for new improved proteases or protease variants for a number of industrial uses.<br>
In particular, the problem of removing egg stains from e.g. laundry or hard surfaces has been pronounced due to the fact that many proteases are inhibited, by substances present in the egg white. Examples of such substances include trypsin inhibitor type IV-0 (Ovo-inhibitor) and trypsin inhibitor type III-O (Ovomucoid).<br>
Therefore, an object of the present invention, is to provide improved subtilase variants, which are not, or which are only to a limited extent, inhibited by such substances. A further object of the present invention is to provide improved subtilase variants, which are suitable for removal of egg stains from, for example, laundry and/or hard surfaces.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Thus, in a first aspect the present invention relates to the use of a subtilase variant for removal of egg stains from laundry or from hard surfaces, the subtilase variant surprising at least one additional amino acid residue in the active site loop (b) region from position 95 to 103 (BASBKJ numbering) .<br><br>
In a second aspect the present invention relates to a subtilase variant selected from the group consisting of<br>
a variant comprising at least one additional amino acid residue in the ac¬tive site (b) loop corresponding to the insertion of at least one addi¬tional amino acid residue between positions 98 and 99 and further comprising at least one additional modification (3ASBEN numbering), and<br>

where the variant - when tested in the 'Ovo-inhibition Assay" dis¬closed in Example 4 herein - has a Residual Activity of at least 10%.<br>
In a third aspect the present invention relates to a subtilase variant se¬lected from the group consisting of<br>
a variant cortprising an insertion of at least one additional amino acid residue between positions 98 and 99 and further conprising a substitution in positions 133 and 143,<br>
a variant conprising an insertion of at least one additional amino acid residue between positions 99 and 100 and further conprising a substitution in position 99,<br>
a variant conprising an insertion of at least one additional amino acid residue between positions 98 and 99 and further conprising substitutions in positions 167, 170 and 194,<br><br>
a variant conprising an insertion of at least one additional amino acid residue between positions 99 and 100 and farther comprising an insertion of at least one additional amino acid residue between positions 216 and 217,<br>
a variant conprising an insertion of at least one additional amino acid residue between positions 99 and 100 and further conprising an insertion of at least one additional amino acid residue between positions 217 and 218,<br>

a variant comprising an insertion of at least one additional amino acid residue between positions 99 and 100 and further conprising an insertion of at least one additional amino acid residue between positions 129 and 130.<br>
In a fourth aspect the present invention relates to an isolated ENA. sequence encoding a subtilase variant of the invention.<br>
In a fifth aspect the present invention relates to an ejqjression vector conprising the isolated U<ja sequence of the invention.></ja>
In a sixth aspect the present invention relates to a microbial host cell transformed with the esqDression vector of the invention.<br>
In a seventh aspect the present invention relates to a method for produc¬ing a subtilase variant according to the invention, wherein a host accord-<br><br>
ing to the invention is cultured under conditions conducive to the expression and secretion of said variant, and the variant is recovered.<br>
In an eight aspect the present invention relates to a cleaning or detergent composition, preferably a laundry or dishwash composition, comprising the variant of the invention.<br>
In a ninth aspect the present invention relates to a method for removal of egg stains from a hard surface or from laundry, the method comprising contacting the egg stain-containing hard surface or the egg stain-containing laundry with a cleaning or detergent composition, preferably a laundry or dishwash composition, containing a subtilase variant comprising at least one additional amino acid residue in the active site loop (b) region from position 95 to 103 (BASBPN numbering).<br>
Still other aspect of the present invention will be apparent from the below description and from the appended claims.<br>

positions 99 and 100 and further comprising an insertion of at least one additional<br>
amino acid residue between positions 129 and 130.<br>
where the variant - when tested in the "Ovo-inhibition Assay" disclosed in Example 4<br>
herein - has a Residual Activity of at least 10%.<br>
Concerning alignment and numbering reference is made to Fig. 1 which shows an alignments between subtilisin BPN' (a) (BASBPN) and subtilisin 309 (BLSAVI) (b).<br>
These alignments are in this patent application used as a reference for numbering the residues.<br>
DEFINITONS<br>
Prior to discussing this invention in further detail, the following terms and<br>
conventions will first be defined.<br>
NOMENCLATURE    AND    CONVENTIONS    FOR    DESIGNATION    OF VARIANTS<br><br>
In describing the various subtilase enzyme variants produced or contemplated according to the invention, the following nomen¬clatures and conventions have been adapted for ease of reference:<br>
A frame of reference is first defined by aligning the isolated or parent enzyme with subtilisin BPN' (BASBPN).<br>
The alignment can be obtained by the GAP routine of the GCG package version 9.1 to number the variants using the following parameters: gap creation penalty = 8 and gap extension penalty = 8 and all other parameters kept at their default values.<br>
Another method is to use known recognized alignments between subtilases, such as the alignment indicated in WO 91/00345. In most cases the differences will not be of any importance.<br>
Thereby a number of deletions and insertions will be defined in relation to BASBPN. In Fig. 1, siibtilisin 309 (Savinase®) has 6 deletions in positions 36, 58, 158, 162, 163, and 164 in comparison to BASBPN. These deletions are in Fig. 1 indicated by asterixes {*).<br>
The various modifications performed in a parent enzyme is indicated in general using three elements as follows:<br>
Original amino acid position substituted amino acid<br>
The notation G195E thus means a substitution of a glycine in position 195 with a glutamic acid.<br><br>
In the case where the original amino acid residue may be any amino acid residue, a short hand notation may at times be used indicating only the position and substituted amino acid;<br>
Position substituted amino acid<br>
Such a notation is particular relevant in connection with modification(s) in homologous subtilases {vids  infra).<br>
Similarly when the identity of the substituting amino acid residue(s) is immaterial:<br>
Original amino acid position<br>
When both the original amino acid(s) and substituted amino acid(s) may comprise any amino acid, then only the position is indicated, e.g.:   170.<br>
When the original amino acid(s) and/or si±&gt;stituted amino acid(s) may comprise more than one, but not all amino acid(s), then the selected amino acids are indicated inside brackets:<br>
Original amino acid position (substituted amino acidi, . . . , substituted amino acidn)<br>
For specific variants the specific three or one letter codes are used, including the codes Xaa and X to indicate any amino acid residue.<br>
SUBSTITUTIONS:<br>
The substitution of glutamic acid for glycine in position 195 is<br>
designated as:<br><br>
Glyl95Glu   or   G195E<br>
or the substitution of any amino acid residue acid for glycine in position 195 is designated as:<br>
Glyl95Xaa  or  G195X or<br>
Glyl95     or  G195<br>
The sxjbstitution of serine for any amino acid residue in position 170 would thus be designated<br>
Xaal70Ser  or  X170S. or<br>
170Ser     or  170S<br>
Such a notation is particular relevant in connection with modification(s) in homologous sxobtilases (vide infra).   170Ser is thus meant to conprise e.g.   both a Lysl70Ser modification in BASBPN and Argl70Ser modification in BLSAVI {cf. Fig. 1) .<br>
For a modification where the original amino acid(s) and/or substituted amino acid(s) may comprise more than one, but not all amino acid(s), the substitution of glycine, alanine, serine or threonine for arginine in position 170 would be indicated by<br>
Argl70{Gly,Ala,Ser,Thr}    or R170{G,A,S,T}<br>
to indicate the variants<br>
R170G, R170A, R170S, and R170T.<br><br>
DELETIONS:<br>
A deletion of glycine in position 195 will be indicated by:<br>
Glyl95*     or  G195*<br>
Correspondingly the deletion of more than one amino acid residue, such as the deletion of glycine and leucine in positions 195 and 196 will be designated<br>
Glyl95*+Leul96*  or   G195*+L196*<br>
INSERTIONS:<br>
The insertion of an additional amino acid residue such as e.g.   a<br>
lysine after G195 is indicated by:<br>
Glyl95GlyLys     or   G195GK; or, when more than one amino acid residue is inserted, such as e.g.   a Lys, Ala and Ser after G195 this will be indicated as:<br>
Glyl95GlyLysAlaSer    or   G195GKAS       (SEQ ID N0:1)<br>
In such cases the inserted amino acid residue(s) are numbered by the addition of lower case letters to the position number of the amino acid residue preceding the inserted amino acid residue(s). In the above example the sequences 194 to 196 would thus be:<br>
194 195 196 BLSAVI      A - G - L<br>
194 195 195a 195b 195c 196<br>
Variant     A-G-K-  A-  S-  L	(SEQ ID NO:16)<br><br>
In cases where an amino acid residue identical to the existing amino acid residue is inserted it is clear that a degeneracy in the nomenclature arises. If for example a glycine is inserted after the glycine in the above example this would be indicated by G195GG. The same actual change could just as well be indicated as A194AG for the change from<br>
194 195 196 BLSAVI      A - G - L<br>
to<br>
194 195  195a 196<br>
Variant     A - G -  G -  L	(SEQ ID NO:27)<br>
194 194a 195  196<br>
Such instances will be apparent to the skilled person, and the indication G195GG and corresponding indications for this type of insertions are thus meant to comprise such equivalent degenerate indications.<br>
FILLING A GAP:<br>
Where a deletion in an enzyme exists in the reference comparison with the subtilisin BPN' sequence used for the numbering, an insertion in such a position is indicated as:<br>
*36Asp     or  *3eD<br>
for the insertion of an aspartic acid in position 36<br>
MULTIPLE MODIFICATIONS:<br><br>
Variants comprising multiple modifications are separated by pluses, e.g. :<br>
Argl70Tyr+Glyl95Glu   or  R170y+G195E<br>
representing modifications in positions 17 0 and 195 substituting tyrosine and glutamic acid for arginine and glycine, respec¬tively.<br>
Thus, Tyrl67{Gly,Ala,Ser,Thr}+Argl70{Gly,Ala,Ser,Thr} designates the following variants:<br><br>
Tyrl67Gly+Argl70Gly, Tyrl67Gly+Argl70Ser, Tyrl67Ala+Argl70Gly, Tyrl67Ala+Argl70Ser, Tyrl67Ser+Argl70Gly, Tyrl67Ser+Argl70S€r, Tyrl67Thr+Argl70Gly, Tyrl67Thr+Argl70Ser,<br><br>
TyrlS7Gly+Argl70Ala, Tyrl67Gly+Argl70Thr, Tyrl67Ala+Argl70Ala, Tyrl67Ala+Argl70Thr, Tyrl67Ser+Argl70Ala, Tyrl6 7Ser+Argl7 OThr, Tyrl67Thr+Argl70Ala, and Tyrl67Thr+Argl70Thr.<br><br>
This nomenclature is particular relevant relating to modifications aimed at substituting, replacing, inserting or deleting amino acid residues having specific common properties, such as residues of positive charge (K, R, H), negative charge (D, E) , or conservative amino acid modification (s) of e.gr. Tyrl67{Gly,Ala, Ser, Thr}+Argl70{Gly, Ala', Ser,Thr}, which signifies substituting a small amino acid for another small amino acid. See section "Detailed description of the invention" for further details.<br>
Proteases<br><br>
Enzymes cleaving the amide linkages in protein siibstrates are classified as proteases, or (interchangeably) peptidases (see Walsh, 1979, Enzymatic Reaction Mechanisms.   W.H. Freeman and Company, San Francisco, Chapter 3).<br>
Numbering of amino acid positions/residues If nothing else is mentioned the amino acid numbering used herein correspond to that of the subtilase BPN' (BASBPN) sequence. For further description of the BPN' sequence, see Fig. 1 or Siezen et al.. Protein Engng.   4 (1991) 719-737.<br>
Serine proteases<br>
A serine protease is an enzyme which catalyzes the hydrolysis of peptide bonds, and in which there is an essential serine residue at the active site (White, Handler and Smith, 1973 "Principles of Biochemistry, "   Fifth Edition, McGraw-Hill Book Company, NY, pp. 271-272) .<br>
The bacterial serine proteases have molecular weights in the 20,000 to 45,000 Dalton range. They are inhibited by diisopro-pylfluorophosphate. They hydrolyze simple terminal esters and are similar in activity to eukaryotic chymotrypsin, also a serine protease. A more narrow term, alkaline protease, covering a sub-group, reflects the high pH optimum of some of the serine proteases, from pH 9.0 to 11.0 (for review, see Priest (1977) Bacteriological    Rev.   41 711-753).<br>
Subtilases<br>
A sub-group of the serine proteases tentatively designated subtilases has been proposed by Siezen et al.,   Protein Engng.   4 (1991) 719-737 and Siezen et al. Protein  Science  6 (1997) 501-523. They are defined by homology analysis of more than 170<br><br>
amino acid sequences of serine proteases previously referred to as subtilisin-like proteases. A subtilisin was previously often defined as a serine protease produced by Gram-positive bacteria or fungi, and according to Siezen et al.   now is a subgroup of the subtilases. A wide variety of subtilases have been identified, and the amino acid sequence of a number of subtilases has been determined. For a more detailed description of such subtilases and their amino acid sequences reference is made to Siezen et al.(1997).<br>
One subgroup of the subtilases, I-SI or "true" subtilisins, comprises the "classical" subtilisins, such as subtilisin 168 (BSS168), subtilisin BPN' (SEQ ID NO:38), subtilisin Carlsberg (ALCAIASE*, NOVO NORDISK A/S) , and subtilisin DY (BSSDY) .<br>
A further subgroup of the subtilases, I-S2 or high alkaline subtilisins, is recognized by Siezen et al.    {supra).   Sub-group I-S2 proteases are described as highly alkaline subtilisins and comprises enzymes such as subtilisin PB92 (BAALKP) (MAXACAL*, Gist-Brocades NV), subtilisin 309 (SEQ ID NO:49)  (SAVINASE*, NOVO NORDISK A/S), subtilisin 147 (BLS147) (ESPERASE^, NOVO NORDISK A/S), and alkaline elastase YaB (BSEYAB).<br>
"SAVINASE®"<br>
SAVINASE® is marketed by NOVO NORDISK A/S. It is subtilisin 309 from B.   Lentus  and differs from BAALKP only in one position (N87S, see Fig. 1 herein) . SAVINASE® has the amino acid sequence designated b) in Fig. 1 and as shown in SEQ ID NO:49.<br>
Parent subtilase<br>
The term "parent subtilase" describes a subtilase defined<br>
according to Siezen et al. (1991 and 1997). For further details<br><br>
see description of "SUBTILASES" immediately above. A parent subtilase may also be a subtilase isolated from a natural source, wherein s-ubseguent modifications have been made while retaining the characteristic of a subtilase. Furthermore, a parent subtilase may also be a subtilase which has been prepared by the DNA shuffling technique, such as described by J.E. Ness et al.,   Nature Biotechnology, 17, 893-896 (1999). Alternatively the term "parent subtilase" may be termed "wild type subtilase".<br>
Modification(s) of a subtilase variant<br>
The term "modification(s)" used herein is defined to include chemical modification of a subtilase as well as genetic manipulation of the DNA encoding a subtilase. The modification(s) can be replacement (s) of the amino acid side chain(s), substitution(s), deletion(s) and/or insertions in or at the amino acid(s) of interest.<br>
Subtilase variant<br>
In the context of this invention, the term subtilase variant or mutated subtilase means a subtilase that has been produced by an organism which is expressing a mutant gene derived from a parent microorganism which possessed an original or parent gene and which produced a corresponding parent enzyme, the parent gene having been mutated in order to produce the mutant gene from which said mutated siibtilase protease is produced when expressed in a suitable host.<br><br>
Homologous subtilase sequences<br>
Specific active site loop regions, and amino acid insertions in<br>
said loops of SAVINASE® subtilase are identified for<br>
modification herein to obtain a subtilase variant of the<br>
invention.<br>
However, the invention is not limited to modifications of this particular subtilase, but extend to other parent (wild-type) sxibtilases, which have a homologous primary structure to that of SAVINASE®. The homology between two amino acid sequences is in this context described by the parameter "identity" .<br>
In order to determine the degree of identity between two subti-lases the GAP routine of the GCG package version 9.1 can be ap¬plied {infra.) using the same settings. The output from the rou¬tine is besides the amino acid alignment the calculation of the "Percent Identity" between the two sequences.<br>
Based on this description it is routine for a person skilled in the art to identify suitable homologous s\ibtilases and corresponding homologous active site loop regions, which can be modified according to the invention.<br>
Isolated DNA sequence<br>
The term "isolated", when applied to a DNA sequence molecule, denotes that the DNA sequence has been removed from its natural genetic milieu and is thus free of other extraneous or unwanted coding sequences, and is in a form suitable for use within genetically engineered protein production systems. Such isolated molecules are those that are separated from their natural environment and include cDNA and genomic clones. Isolated DNA molecules of the present invention are free of other genes with<br><br>
which they are ordinarily associated, but may include naturally occurring 5' and 3' untranslated regions such as promoters and terminators. The identification of associated regions will be evident to one of ordinary skill in the art (see for example, Dynan and Tijan, Nature 316:774-78, 1985). The term "an isolated E)NA sequence" may alternatively be termed "a cloned DNA sequence".<br>
Isolated protein<br>
When applied to a protein, the term "isolated" indicates that<br>
the protein has been removed from its native environment.<br>
In a preferred form, the isolated protein is stibstantially free of other proteins, particularly other homologous proteins (i.e. "homologous impurities" (see below)).<br>
An isolated protein is more than 10% pure, preferably more than 2 0% pure, more preferably more than 3 0% pure, as determined by SDS-PAGE. Further it is preferred to provide the protein in a highly purified form, i.e., more than 40% pure, more than 60% pure, more than 80% pure, more preferably more than 95% pure, and most preferably more than 99% pure, as determined by SDS-PAGE.<br>
The teirm "isolated protein" may alternatively be termed "purified protein".<br>
Homologous impurities<br>
The term "homologous impurities" means any impurity (e.g. another polypeptide than the subtilase of the invention), which originate from the homologous cell where the subtilase of the invention is originally obtained from.<br><br>
Obtained from<br>
The term 'obtained from" as used herein in connection with a specific microbial source, means that the polynucleotide and/or subtilase produced by the specific source, or by a cell in which a gene from the source has been inserted.<br>
Substrate<br>
The term "substrate" used in connection with a substrate for a protease should be interpreted in its broadest form as comprising a compound containing at least one peptide bond susceptible to hydrolysis by a subtilisin protease.<br>
Product<br>
The term "product" used in connection with a product derived from a protease enzymatic reaction should, in the context of the present invention, be interpreted to include the products of a hydrolysis reaction involving a subtilase protease. A product may be the substrate in a subsequent hydrolysis reaction.<br>
Wash Performance<br>
In the present context the term "wash performance" is used as an enzyme's ability to remove egg stains present on the object to be cleaned during e.g. wash or hard surface cleaning. See also the "Model Detergent Wash Performance Test" in Example 3 herein.<br>
Performance Factor<br>
The term "Performance Factor" is defined with respect to the<br>
below formula<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING<br>
Fig. 1 shows an alignment between subtilisin BPN' (a) and<br>
Savinase (b) using the GAP routine mentioned above.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present inventors have found that subtilisin variants, wherein the active site loop (b) region is longer than those presently known, exhibit improved wash performance with respect to removal of egg stains. The identification thereof was done in constructing subtilisin variants, especially of the svibtilisin 3 09 (BLSAVI or Savinase®) , exhibiting improved wash performance properties (with respect to removal of egg stains) in model detergent compositions relative to the parent wild type enzyme.<br>
Without being limited to any specific theory it is presently believed that the improved effect is due to an impeded binding of the egg white inhibitor in the active site loop (b) region of the subtilase variant. This in turn is probably due to structural changes of the active site loop (b) region because of<br><br>
insertion of  one  or more  additional  amino acid residues   in this particular  site  of  the enzyme.<br>
Thus,   variants which are  contemplated as being  suitable  for the uses described herein are  such variants where,   when compared to the wild-type subtilase,   one or more  amino  acid residues has been inserted in one or more  of  the  following positions: between positions 95 and 96,  between positions 96 and 97,  between posi¬tions 97 and 98, between positions 98 and 99,  between positions 99 and 100, between positions 100 and 101,  between positions 101 and 102, between positions 102 and 103,  between positions 103 and 104,  and combinations thereof.<br>
Preferably,  the insertion is made between position 97 and 98,  between po¬sitions 98 and 99, between positions 99 and 100 and/or between positions 100 and 101,  in particular between positions 98 and 99 and between posi¬tions 99 and 100.<br>
A  subtilase variant  of the  first  aspect  of  the  invention may be a parent  or wild-type  s\ibtilase  identified and  isolated from nature.<br>
Such  a parent wildtype  subtilase may be  specifically screened for by standard techniques  known in the  art.<br>
One preferred way of  doing  this  may be  by  specifically PCR amplify DNA regions known to encode  active  site   loops  in subtilases   from numerous   different  microorganism,   preferably different Bacillus   strains.<br><br>
Sxibtilases are a group of conserved enzymes, in the sense that their DNA and amino acid sequences are homologous. Accordingly it is possible to construct relatively specific primers flanking active site loops.<br>
One way of doing this is by investigating an alignment of different subtilases (see e.g.   Siezen et al. Protein Science 6 (1997) 501-523). It is from this routine work for a person skilled in the art to construct PCR primers flanking the active site loop corresponding to the active site loop (b) between amino acid residue 95 to 103 in any of the group I-Sl or I-S2 groups, such as from BLSAVI. Using such PCR primers to amplify DNA from a number of different microorganism, preferably different Bacillus strains, followed by DNA sequencing of said amplified PCR fragments, it will be possible to identify strains which produce subtilases of these groups comprising a longer, as compared to e.g. BLSAVI, active site region corresponding to the active site loop region from positions 95 to 103. Having identified the strain and a partial DNA sequence of such a subtilase of interest, it is routine work for a person skilled in the art to complete cloning, expression and purification of such a subtilase.<br>
However, it is envisaged that a subtilase variant of the invention predominantly is a variant of a parent subtilase.<br>
A subtilase variant suitable for the us'es described herein, may be constructed by standard techniques known in the art such as by site-directed/random mutagenesis or by DNA shuffling of different siibtilase sequences. See the "Material and Methods" section herein {vide infra)   for further details.<br><br>
As will be acknowledged by the skilled person, the variants described herein may, in addition to the at least one insertion from position 95 to 103, comprise at least one further modifica¬tion. For example, the variants may comprise one or more substitutions in the active site loop (b) region as well as one or more substitutions outside said region. Furthermore, the variants may comprise one or more further insertions outside the active site loop (b) region.<br>
Moreover, the insertions in the regions described herein may encompass insertion of more than just one amino acid residue. For example the variant according to the invention may contain one insertion, two insertions, or more than two insertions, such as three, four or five insertions.<br>
In preferred embodiments of the present invention, the further modification is perforrred in a position selected from the group consisting of: substitution in position 99, substitution in position 133, substitution in position 143, s\±)Stitution in position 167, substitution in position 170, substitution in position 194, insertion between positions 42 and 43, insertion between positions 129 and 130, insertion between positions 216 and 217, insertion between 217 and 218, and combinations thereof.<br>

Furthermore variants comprising any of the variants S101G+V104N, S87N+S101G+V104N, K27R+V104Y+N123S+T274A, N76D+S103A+V104I or N76D+V104A or Other combinations of these mutations (V104N, SIOIG, K27R, V104Y, N123S, T274A, N76D, V104A) or S101G+S103A+V104I+G159D+A232V+Q236H+Q245R+N248D+N252K in combi¬nation with any one or more of the modification(s) mentioned above exhibit improved properties.<br>
Moreover, subtilase variants of the main aspect(s) of the inven¬tion are preferably combined with one or more modification(s) in any of the positions 129, 131 and 194, preferably as 129K, 131H and 194P modifications, and most preferably as P129K, P131H and A194P modifications. Any of those modification(s) are expected to provide a higher expression level of the subtilase variant in the production thereof.<br>
As mentioned above, the variants disclosed herein are only inhibited by trypsin inhibitor type IV-0 to a limited extent and, consequently, they exhibit excellent wash performance on egg stains. Therefore, in order to enable the skilled person -at an early stage of his development work - to select effective and preferred variants for this purpose, the present inventors have provided a suitable preliminary test, which can easily be carried out by the skilled person in order to initially assess the performance of the variant in question.<br><br>
Thus, the 'Ovo-inhibition Assay" disclosed in Example 4 herein may be employed to initially assess the potential of a selected variant. In other words, the "Ovo-inhibition Assay" may be employed to assess whether a selected variant will be inhibited, and to what extent, by the trypsin inhibitor type IV-0. Using this test, the suitability of a selected variant to remove egg stains can be assessed, the rationale being that if a selected variant is strongly inhibited by trypsin inhibitor type IV-0, it is normally not necessary to carry out further test experiments.<br>
Therefore, a variant which is particular interesting for the use described herein, is a variant which - when tested in the "Ovo-inhibition Assay" described in Example 4 herein - has a Residual Activity of at least 10%, e.g. at least 15%, such as at least 20%, preferably at least 25%, such as at least 30%, more preferably at least 35%. In a particular interesting embodiment of the invention, the variant has a Residual Activity of at least 40%, such as at least 45%, e.g. at least 50%, preferably at least 55%, such as at least 60%, more preferably at least 65%, such as at least 70%, even more preferably at least 75%, such as at least 80%, e.g. at least 90%, when tested in the 'Ovo-inhibition Assay" described in Example 4 herein.<br>
Evidently, it is preferred that the variant of the invention fulfils the above criteria on at least the stated lowest level, more preferably at the stated intermediate level and most preferably on the stated highest level.<br>
Alternatively, or in addition to the above-mentioned assay, the suitability of a selected variant may be tested in the "Model Detergent Wash Performance Test" disclosed in Example 3 herein. The "Model Detergent Wash Perfomance Test" may be employed to<br><br>
assess the ability of a variant, when incorporated in a standard detergent composition, to remove egg stains from a standard textile as compared to a reference system, namely the parent subtilase (incorporated in the same model detergent system and tested under identical conditions). Using this test, the suitability of a selected variant to remove egg stains can be initially investigated, the rationale being that if a selected variant does not show a significant improvement in the test compared to the parent subtilase, it is normally not necessary to carry out further test experiments.<br>
Therefore, variants which are particular interesting for the use described herein, are such variants which, when tested in a model detergent composition comprising<br>
6.2%	LAS (Nansa BOS)<br>
2%	Sodium salt  of  Cig-Cig  fatty acid<br>
4%	Non-ionic  surfactant   (Plurafax LF404)<br>
22%	Zeolite P<br>
10.5%	Na^COj<br>
4%	NajSijOj<br>
2%	Carboxymethylcellulose (CMC)<br>
6.8%	Acrylate liquid CP5 40%<br>
20%	Sodium perborate (empirical formula NaBOj.HsOj)<br>
0.2%	EDTA<br>
21%	NasSO,<br>
Water (balance)<br>
as described in the "Model Detergent Wash Performance Test" disclosed in Example 3 herein, shows an improved wash performance on egg stains as compared to the parent subtilase tested under identical conditions.<br><br>
The improvement in the wash performance may be quantified by employing the so-called "Performance Factor" defined in Example 3, herein.<br>
In a very interesting embodiment of the invention, the variant of the invention, when tested in the *'Wash Performance Test" has a Performance Factor of at least 1, such as at least 1.5, e.g. at least 2, preferably at least 2.5, such as at least 3, e.g. at least 3.5, in particular at least 4, such as at least 4.5, e.g. at least 5.<br>
Evidently, it is preferred that the variant of the invention fulfils the above criteria on at least the stated lowest level, more preferably at the stated intermediate level and most preferably on the stated highest level.<br>
As indicated above, the present invention also provides novel subtilase variants. It will be understood that details and par¬ticulars concerning the novel subtilase variant aspects of the invention will be the same or analogous to the details and par¬ticulars of the variants discussed above in connection with the use aspect of the invention. This means that whenever appropri¬ate, the statements concerning the use (e.g. preferred inser¬tions and substitutions, etc.) discussed in detail herein, apply mutatis mutandis to the novel subtilase variants according to the invention as well as to the method aspect and the cleaning and detergent composition aspect of the invention.<br>
PRODUCING A SUBTILASE VARIANT<br>
Many methods for cloning a subtilase and for introducing inser¬tions into genes (e.g. subtilase genes) are well known in the<br><br>
art, cf. the references cited in the "BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION" section.<br>
In general standard procedures for cloning of genes and intro¬ducing insertions (random and/or site directed) into said genes may be used in order to obtain a subtilase variant of the inven¬tion. For further description of suitable techniques reference is made to Examples herein {vide infra)   and (Sambrook et al. (1989) Molecular cloning: A laboratory manual, Cold Spring Har¬bor lab., Cold Spring Harbor, NY; Ausubel, F. M. et al. (eds.) "Current protocols in Molecular Biology". John Wiley and Sons, 1995; Harwood, C. R., and Cutting, S. M. (eds.) "Molecular Bio¬logical Methods for Bacillus". John Wiley and Sons, 1990); and WO 96/34946.<br>
Further, a subtilase variant may be constructed by standard techniques for artificial creation of diversity, such as by DNA shuffling of different subtilase genes (WO 95/22625; Stemmer WPC, Nature 370:389-91 (1994)). DNA shuffling of e.g.   the gene encoding Savinase® with one or more partial subtilase sequences identified in nature to comprise an active site (b) loop regions longer than the active site (b) loop of Savinase®, will after s\ibsequent screening for improved wash performance variants, provide subtilase variants suitable for the purposes described herein.<br>
EXPRESSION VECTORS<br>
A recombinant expression vector comprising a DNA construct<br>
encoding the enzyme of the invention may be any vector which may<br>
conveniently be subjected to recombinant DNA procedures.<br>
The choice of vector will often depend on the host cell into<br>
which it is to be introduced. Thus, the vector may be an<br><br>
autonomously replicating vector, i.e. a vector which exists as an extrachromosomal entity, the replication of which is indepen¬dent of chromosomal replication, e.g. a plasmid.<br>
Alternatively, the vector may be one that on introduction into a host cell is integrated into the host cell genome in part or in its entirety and replicated together with the chromosome (s) into which it has been integrated.<br>
The vector is preferably an expression vector in which the DNA sequence encoding the enzyme of the invention is operably linked to additional segments required for transcription of the DNA. In general, the expression vector is derived from plasmid or viral DJIA, or may contain elements of both. The term, "operably linked" indicates that the segments are arranged so that they function in concert for their intended purposes, e.g. transcription initiates in a promoter and proceeds through the DNA sequence coding for the enzyme.<br>
The promoter may be any DNA sequence which shows transcriptional activity in the host cell of choice and may be derived from genes encoding proteins either homologous or heterologous to rhe host cell.<br>
Examples of suitable promoters for use in bacterial host cells include the promoter of the Bacillus  stearothermophilus maltogenic amylase gene, the Bacillus licheniformis  alpha-amylase gene, the Bacillus  amyloliquefaciens  alpha-amylase gene, the Bacillus subtilis  alkaline protease gen, or the Bacillus pumilus  xylosidase gene, or the phage Lambda P^ or P-^ promoters or the E. coli lac, trp or tac promoters.<br><br>
The DNA sequence encoding the enzyme of the invention may also, if necessary, be operably connected to a suitable terminator.<br>
The recombinant vector of the invention may further comprise a DNA sequence enabling the vector to replicate in the host cell in question.<br>
The vector may also comprise a selectable marker, e.g. a gene the product of which complements a defect in the host cell, or a gene encoding resistance to e.g. antibiotics like kanamycin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, tetracycline, spectinomycine, or the like, or resistance to heavy metals or herbicides.<br>
To direct an enzyme of the present invention into the secretory pathway of the host cells, a secretory signal sequence (also known as a leader sequence, prepro sequence or pre sequence) may be provided in the recombinant vector. The secretory signal sequence is joined to the DNA sequence encoding the enzyme in the correct reading frame. Secretory signal sequences are commonly positioned 5' to the DNA sequence encoding the enzyme. The secretory signal sequence may be that normally associated with the enzyme or may be from a gene encoding another secreted protein.<br>
The procedures used to ligate the DNA sequences coding for the present enzyme, the promoter and optionally the terminator and/or secretory signal sequence, respectively, or to assemble these sequences by suitable PCR amplification schemes, and to insert them into suitable vectors containing the information necessary for replication or integration, are well known to persons skilled in the art (cf., for instance, Sambrook et al., op.cit.).<br><br>
HOST CELL<br>
The DNA sequence encoding the present enzyme introduced into the host cell may be either homologous or heterologous to the host in question. If homologous to the host cell, i.e. produced by the host cell in nature, it will typically be operably connected to another promoter sequence or, if applicable, another secretory signal sequence and/or terminator sequence than in its natural environment. The term "homologous" is intended to include a DNA sequence encoding an enzyme native to the host organism in question. The term "heterologous" is intended to include a DMA sequence not expressed by the host cell in nature. Thus, the DNA sequence may be from another organism, or it may be a synthetic sequence.<br>
The host cell into which the DNA construct or the recombinant vector of the invention is introduced may be any cell which is capable of producing the present enzyme and includes bacteria, yeast, fungi and higher eukaryotic cells including plants.<br>
Examples of bacterial host cells which, on cultivation, are capable of producing the enzyme of the invention are gram-positive bacteria such as strains of Bacillus,   such as strains of 3.   siibtilis,   B.   licheniformis,   B. lentus, B. bre'^'is,   3. stearothermophilus,   3.   alkalophilus,   3.. amyloliquefaciens,   3. coagulans,   B.   circulans,   B.   lautus,   B.   megatherium  or S. thuringiensis,   or strains of Streptomyces, such as S.   lividans or S.   murinus,   or gram-negative bacteria such as Echerichia coli.<br>
The transformation of the bacteria may be effected by protoplast transformation, electroporation, conjugation, or by using<br><br>
competent cells in a manner )cnown per se (cf. Sambrook et al. , supra) .<br>
When expressing the enzyme in bacteria such as E.   coli,   the enzyme may be retained in the cytoplasm, typically as insoluble granules (known as inclusion bodies), or may be directed to the periplasmic space by a bacterial secretion sequence. In the former case, the cells are lysed and the granules are recovered and denatured after which the enzyme is refolded by diluting the denaturing agent. In the latter case, the enzyme may be recovered from the periplasmic space by disrupting the cells, e.g. by sonication or osmotic shock, to release the contents of the periplasmic space and recovering the enzyme.<br>
When expressing the enzyme in gram-positive bacteria such as Bacillus or Streptomyces strains, the enzyme may be retained in the cytoplasm, or may be directed to the extracellular medium by a bacterial secretion sequence. In the latter case, the enzyme may be recovered from the medium as described below.<br>
METHOD FOR PRODUCING A SUBTILASE VARIANT<br>
The present invention provides a method of producing an isolated<br>
enzyme according to the invention, wherein a suitable host cell,<br>
which has been transformed with a DNA sequence encoding the<br>
enzyme, is cultured under conditions permitting the production<br>
of the enzyme, and the resulting enzyme is recovered from the<br>
culture.<br>
When an expression vector comprising a DNA sequence encoding the enzyme is transformed into a heterologous host cell it is possible to enable heterologous recombinant production of the enzyme of the invention.<br><br>
Thereby it is possible to make a highly purified subtilase composition, characterized in being free from homologous impurities.<br>
In this context homologous impurities means any impurities (e.g. other polypeptides than the enzyme of the invention) which originate from the homologous cell where the enzyme of the invention is originally obtained from.<br>
The medium used to culture the transformed host cells may be any conventional medium suitable for growing the host cells in question. The expressed subtilase may conveniently be secreted into the culture medium and may be recovered therefrom by well-known procedures including separating the cells from the medium by centrifugation or filtration, precipitating proteinaceous components of the medium by means of a salt such as ammonium sulfate, followed by chromatographic procedures such as ion exchange chromatography, affinity chromatography, or the like.<br>
CLSAtxTING AMD DETERGENT COMPOSITIONS<br>

Furthermore the examples herein demonstrate the improvements in wash performance on egg stains for a number of subtilase variants.<br>
Detergent Compositions<br><br>
The subtilase variant may be added to and thus become a compo¬nent of a detergent composition.<br>

ENZYMES FOR DNA MANIPULATIONS<br><br>
Unless otherwise mentioned all enzymes for DNA manipulations, such as e.g.   restiction endonucleases, ligases etc., are ob¬tained from New England Biolabs, Inc.<br>
PROTEOLYTIC ACTIVITY<br>
In the context of this invention proteolytic activity is<br>
expressed in Kilo NOVO Protease Units (KNPU). The activity is<br>
determined relatively to an enzyme standard (SAVINASE ), and the determination is based on the digestion of a dimethyl casein (DMC) solution by the proteolytic enzyme at standard conditions, i.e. 50°C, pH 8.3, 9 min. reaction time, 3 min. measuring time. A folder AF 22 0/1 is available upon request to Novo Nordisk A/S, Denmark, which folder is hereby included by reference.<br>
A GU is a Glycine Unit, defined as the proteolytic enzyme activity which, under standard conditions, during a 15 minutes' incubation at 40°C, with N-acetyl casein as substrate, produces an amount of NHj-group equivalent to 1 mmole of glycine.<br>
Enzyme activity can also be measured using the PNA assay, according to reaction with the soluble substrate succinyl-alanine-alanine-proline-phenyl-alanine-para-nitro-phenol, which is described in the Journal of American Oil Chemists Society, Rothgeb, T.M., Goodlander, B.D., Garrison, P.H., and Smith, L.A., (1988) .<br>
FERMENTATION:<br>
Fermentations for the production of subtilase enzymes were performed at 30°C on a rotary shaking table (300 r.p.m.) in 500 ml baffled Erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 ml BPX medium for 5 days.<br><br>
Consequently in order to make an e.g.   2   liter broth 20 Erlenmeyer flasks were fermented simultaneously.<br>
MEDIA:<br>
BPX Medium Composition	(per liter)<br>
Potato starch	100	g<br>
Ground barley	50	g<br>
Soybean flour	20	g<br>
Na2HP04 X 12 H2O	9	9<br>

The starch in the medium is liquefied with a-amylase and the medium is sterilized by heating at 120°C for 45 minutes. After sterilization the pH of the medium is adjusted to 9 by addition of NaHC03 to 0.1 M.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
CONSTRUCTION AND EXPRESSION OF ENZYME VARIANTS:<br>
SITE-DIRECTED MUTAGENESIS:<br>
Subtilase 309 (savinase®) site-directed variants of the invention comprising specific insertions and comprising specific substitutions were made by traditional cloning of DNA fragments (Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor, 198 9) produced by PCR with oligos containing the desired insertions (see below).<br>
The template plasmid DNA was pJS3 (see below) , or an analogue of<br>
this containing a variant of Subtilase 309.<br><br>
Insertions and substitutions were introduced by oligo directed mutagenesis to the construction of variants.<br>
The Subtilase 309 variants were transformed into E.   coli.   DNA purified from a over night culture of these transformants were transformed into B. subtilis  by restriction endonuclease digestion, purification of DNA fragments, ligation, transforma¬tion of B.   subtilis. Transformation of B. subtilis was performed as described by Dubnau et al., 1971, J. Mol. Biol. 56, pp. 209-221.<br>
SITE-DIRECTED MUTAGENESIS IN ORDER TO INTRODUCE INSERTIONS AND •SUBSTITUTIONS IN A SPECIFIC REGION:<br>
The overall strategy to used to perform site-directed mutagenesis was:<br>
Mutagenic primers (oligonucleotides) were synthesized corresponding to the DNA sequence flanking the sites of insertion and substitutions, separated by the DNA base pairs defining the insertions and substitutions.<br>
Subsequently, the resulting mutagenic primers were used in a PCR reaction with the modified plasmid pJS3 (see above). The resulting PCR fragment was purified and extended in a second PCR-reaction, the resulting PCR product was purified and either cloned into the E.   coli   -  B.   subtilis  shuttle vector (see below) or extended in a third PCR-reaction before being digested by endonucleases and cloned into the E.   coli   -  B.   subtilis  shuttle vector (see below). The PCR reactions are performed under normal conditions.<br>
Following this strategy insertions and substitutions was constructed in savinase® wherein insertions and substitutions<br><br>
was introduced according to the below table. The primers used for each PCR step are shown as well as the cloning sites used.<br>
Following the above strategy a detailed example follows:<br>
Two insertion and one substitution was constructed in savinase® wherein insertions was introduced in position 99 (*99aD) and 217 (*217aP) respectively and a substitution was introduced in position S99A (see below).<br>
The insertion and substitution at position 99 was introduced by a mutagenic primer (5' CCG AAC CTG AAC CAT CCG CGG CCC CTA GGA CTT TAA CAG C 3' {sense))    (SEQ ID N0:71) were used in a PCR re¬action with an opposite primer (5' GAG TTA AGC CCA GAA GAT GTG GAC GCG 3'(antisense)) (SEQ ID NO:83).<br>
The produced PCR fragment were extended towards the C-terminal of Savinase by a second round of PCR introducing the insertion at position 217 with primer; 5' CAT CGA TGT ACC GTT TGG  TAA GCT GGC ATA TGT TG 3' (SEQ ID NO: 94) . The second round PCR product were extended towards the C-terminal of Savinase by a third round of PCR with primer; 5' AAC CGC ACA GCG TTT TTT TAT TGA TTA ACG CGT TGC 3' (SEQ ID NO:105), situated downstream at the Mlu I site in pJS3. All PCR reactions used plasmid pJS3 as template. The extended DNA-fragment resulting from third round PCR was cloned into the Sal I- and Mlu I- sites of the modified plasmid pJS3 (see above).<br>
The plasmid DNA was transformed into E. coli by well-known techniques and one B.   coli  colony were sequenced to confirm the mutation designed.<br>
All other variants were constructed in an analogous manner.<br>
In order to purify a subtilase variant of the invention, the B. suJbtilis pJS3 expression plasmid comprising a variant of the<br><br>
invention was transformed into a competent B.   subtilis  strain and was fermented as described above in a medium containing 10 |i.g/ml Ch.lorair5)henicol (CAM) .<br>

EXAMPLE 2<br>
PURIFICATION OF ENZYME VARIANTS:<br>
This procedure relates to purification of a 2 liter scale fermentation for the production of the subtilases of the invention in a Bacillus  host cell.<br>
Approximately 1.6  liters of fermentation broth were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 35 minutes in 1 liter beakers. The supernatants were adjusted to pH 6.5 using 10% acetic acid and filtered on Seitz Supra SlOO filter plates.<br>
The filtrates were concentrated to approximately 400 ml using an Amicon CH2A UF unit equipped with an Amicon SlYlO UF cartridge. The UF concentrate was centrifuged and filtered prior to absorption at room temperature on a Bacitracin affinity column at pH 7. The protease was sluted from the Bacitracin column at<br><br>
room temperature using 25% 2-propanol and 1 M sodium chloride in a buffer solution with 0.01 dimethylglutaric acid, 0.1 M boric acid and 0.002 M calcium chloride adjusted to pH 7.<br>
The fractions with protease activity from the Bacitracin purification step were combined and applied to a 750 ml Sephadex G25 column (5 cm dia.) equilibrated with a buffer containing 0.01 dimethylglutaric acid, 0.2 M boric acid and 0.0 02 m calcium chloride adjusted to pH 6.5.<br>
Fractions with proteolytic activity from the Sephadex G25 column were combined and applied to a 150 ml CM Sepharose CL 6B cation exchange column (5 cm dia.) equilibrated with a buffer containing 0.01 M dimethylglutaric acid, 0.2 M boric acid, and 0.002 M calcium chloride adjusted to pH 6.5.<br>
The protease was eluted using a linear gradient of 0-0.1 M sodium chloride in 2 litres of the same buffer (0-0.2 M sodium chloride in case of Subtilisin 147).<br>
In a final purification step protease containing fractions from the CM Sepharose column were combined and concentrated in an Amicon ultrafiltration cell equipped with a GR81PP membrane (from the Danish Sugar Factories Inc.).<br>
By using the techniques of Example 1 for the construction and fermentation, and the above isolation procedure the following subtilisin 309 variants were produced and isolated:<br><br>

The "MODEL DETERGENT WASH PERFORMANCE TEST" : In order to asses the wash performance of selected subtilase variants in a standard detergent composition, standard washing experiments may be performed using the below experimental conditions:<br><br>
Detergent: Detergent dosage pH<br>
Wash time Temperature: Water hardness: Enzyme concentration; Test system: Textile/volume:<br>
Test material:<br><br>
Model detergent<br>
4.0 g/1<br>
10.1<br>
20 min<br>
30°C<br>
15°dH<br>
10 nm (in the detergent solution)<br>
10 ml beakers with a stirring rod<br>
5 textile pieces (0 2 . 5 cm)/50 ml<br>
detergent solution<br>
WFKION (egg stains)<br><br>
The composition of the model detergent is as follows<br>
6.2% LAS (Nansa SOS)<br>
2%    Sodium salt of C^g-Cig fatty acid<br><br>
4%	Non-ionic   surfactant   (Plurafax LF404)<br>
22%	Zeolite  P<br>
10.5%	Na2C03<br>
4%	Na^SisOs<br>
2%	Carboxymethylcellulose (CMC)<br>
5.8%	Acrylate liquid CP5 40%<br>
2 0%	Sodium perborate (empirical formula NaBOj.H^Oj)<br>
0.2%	EDTA<br>
21%	Na^SO^<br>
Water (balance)<br>
pH of the detergent solution is adjusted to 10.1 by addition of HCl or NaOH. Water hardness is adjusted to 15°dH by addition of CaClj and MGClj (Ca^^rMg^* = 4:1) to the test system. After washing the textile pieces were flushed in tap water and air-dried.<br>
Measurement of the reflectance (Rvariant) ^^ the test material is performed at 46 0 nm using a Macbeth ColorEye 70 0 0 photometer (Macbeth, Division of Kollmorgen Instruments Corporation, .Germany). The measurements are performed accordance with the manufacturer's protocol.<br>
In order to determine a blank value, a similar wash experiment is performed without addition of enzyme. The subsequent measurement of the reflectance (Rtiank) is performed as described right above.<br>
A reference experiment is then performed as described above, wherein the wash performance of the parent enzyme is tested. The subsequent measurement of the reflectance (Rpareat) is performed as described right above.<br><br>
The wash performance is evaluated by means of the Performance Factor (P) which is defined in accordance with the below formula:<br>
P    =      (Variant    ~    ^blnnk'      ~      'parent    ~    ^blank^ ~    ■'Variant    ~    ■'TJarent.<br>
Using the above test method the following results were obtained;<br><br>
Enzyme	R (460 nm)	P<br>
Blank (no enzyme)	40.5	-<br>
Parent (Savinase®)	40.7	-<br>
S99SD + S99A	43.2	2.5<br>

S99SE + S99T	-	2.0<br>
A98AS + A133E + T143K	45.1	4.4<br>
A98AT + G97D	-	1.5<br>
A98ATGTG	-	1.6<br>
A9 BAG	-	1.7<br>
A98AS + R45K + S105G	-	1.8<br>
A9 8AT + G97E	-	2.0<br>
A98ASGTG	-	2.1<br>
A98AP + A98G + S99A	—	2.3<br>
As it appears, the subtilase variants exhibit improved wash per¬formance on egg stains in comparison to the parent subtilase, i.e. Savinase*.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
THE "OVO-INHIBITION ASSAY'<br><br>
The below inhibition assay is based on the principle that the subtilase variant to be tested will catalyse the hydrolysis of a peptide-pNA bond, thereby releasing the yellow pNA, which may conveniently be followed at 4 05 nm. The amount of released pNA after a given period of time is a direct measure of the subti¬lase activity. By carrying out such hydrolysis experiments with and without inhibitor, respectively, it is possible to obtain a quantitative measure for the degree to which a certain subtilase variant is inhibited.<br>
Reaction conditions:<br>
Enzyme concentration:	0.0003 mg/ml<br>
Cone, of trypsin inhibitor type IV-0:	0.0015 mg/ml<br>
Initial substrate concentration:	0.81 mM<br>
Reaction time:	11 min<br>
Assay temperature:	25°C<br>
Assay pH:	8.6<br>
Absorbance measured at:	405 nm<br>
