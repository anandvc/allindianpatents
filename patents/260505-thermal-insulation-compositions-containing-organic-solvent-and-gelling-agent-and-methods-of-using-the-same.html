				<td>SPECIFICATION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to enhancement of the thermal insulation of production tubing or a transfer pipe by use of a novel thermal insulating composition which controls the heat transfer from the tubing or pipe to one or more surrounding annuli and the environment. The fluid viscosity of the composition is capable of reducing the convection (low velocity within the surrounding annulus of "he well or transfer pipe being treated.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Undesired heat loss from production tubing as well as uncontrolled heat transfer to outer annuli can be detrimental to the mechanical integrity of outer annuli. because productivity losses from the well due to deposition of paraffin and asphaltene materials, accelerate the formation of gas hydrates, and destabilize the permafrost in arctic type regions. The successful use of wellborc insulation fluids in the past several years has demonstrated that such fluids, added either into annulus or riser, can effectively reduce undesired heat loss.<br>
For instance. U.S. Patent No. 6.489.270 discloses non-crosshnked insulating fluids which are easy to blend and pump into the annulus. Such fluids, when added either into an annulus or riser, effectively reduce undesired heal loss from the production tubing, or heat transfer to outer annuli.<br>
Water-superabsorbent polymers are disclosed for use in gelled fluids as thermal insulating fluids in U.S. Patent Publication No. 20040059054. Such gelled fluids exhibited an inherently low thermal conductivity and the requisite viscosity. The fluid viscosity was generated by mixing the requisite amount, typically between from 0.1 to 10 weight percent, of polysaccharide into a brine system which may optionally contain a glycol, such as propylene glycol and a viscosifying polymer, such as carboxymelhyl hydroxypropyl guar. The resulting fluid, which r.rc easy to blend and pump at the rig site, reduces the heat loss from a hot annulus to a cold annulus h\ reducing the fluid thermal convection caused by the temperature differential between the high temperature environment of the inner annulus and low temperature environment of the outer annuli.   Fluid thermal convection, which accounts for the<br><br>
major portion of the heat transfer, is dependent on the fluid viscosity and mobility of the solvent, such as a water-polyol mixture.<br>
Alternative materials which are more effective in the retention of heal have been sought. Such materials arc needed in order to improve the intrinsic thermal conductivity of the solvent system of insulation fluids.<br>

By saturated brine, it is understood that the brine is saturated with at least one salt, such as sodium bromide.<br>
The thermal insulating compositions of the invention may further contain a crosslinking metal-releasing agent. As used herein, the term "crosslinking metal-releasing agent" is taken to designate those metal or metal containing materials which will provide a metal ion or metal containing species in the solution capable of crosslinking the viscosifying polymer.<br>
The crosslinking agent preferably comprises a borate ion releasing compound, an organometallic or organic complexed metal ion comprising at least one transition metal or alkaline earth metal ion as well as mixtures thereof, such as Zr (IV) and Ti (IV).

Borate ion releasing compounds which can be employed include, for example, any boron compound which will supply borate ions in the composiiion. for example, boric acid, alkali metal borates such as sodium diborate. potassium tetraborate, sodium tetraborate (borax), penraborates and the like and alkaline and zinc metal borates. Such borate ion releasing compounds arc disclosed in U.S. Pal. 3.058.909 and U.S. Pal. No. 3.974.077 herein incorporated by reference. In addition, such borate ion releasing compounds include boric oxide (such as selected from hhBCh and B2O3) and polymeric borate compounds. An example of a suitable polymeric borate compound is a polymeric compound of boric acid and an alkali borate which is commercially available under the trademark POLYBOR® from U.S. Borax of Valencia. Calif.. Mixtures of any of the referenced borate ion releasing compounds may further be employed. Such borate-releasers typically require a basic pH (e.g.. 7.0 to 12) for crosslinking to occur.<br>
Further preferred crosslinking agents are reagents, such as organometallic and organic complexed metal compounds, which can supply zirconium IV ions such as.<br><br>
carbonate, zirconium aeetylacetonate and zirconium diisopropylamine lactate: as well as compounds that can supply titanium IV ions such as. for example, titanium ammonium lactate, titanium triclhanolamine. and titanium aeetylacetonate. Zr (IV) and Ti (IV) may further be added directly as ions or oxy ions into the composition.<br>
Such organometallic and organic complexed metal crosslinking agents containing titanium or zirconium in a +4 valence state include those disclosed in British Pal. No. 2.108.122. herein incorporated herein by reference, which are prepared by reacting zirconium tctraalkoxides with alkanolamincs under essentially anhydrous conditions. Other zirconium and titanium crosslinking agents are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 3.888.312: U.S. Pat. No. 3.301.723: U.S. Pat. No. 4.460.751: U.S. Pal. No. 4.477.360: Europe Pat. No. 92.755: and U.S. Patent No. 4.780.223. all of which arc herein incorporated by reference. Such organometallic and organic complexed metal crosslinking agents containing titanium or zirconium in a +4 oxidation valance state may contain one or more alkanoiamine ligands such as cthanolaminc (mono-, di- or triclhanolamine) ligands. such as bis(trielhanolamine)bis(isopropol)-lilanium (IV). Further, the compounds may be supplied as inorganic oxides, such as zirconium or titanium dioxide. Such crosslinking agents are typically used at a pH also in the range from about 6 to about 13.<br>
Any suitable crosslinking metal ion. metal containing species, or mixture of such ions and species may further be employed. In a preferred embodiment, the crosslinking agent for use in the thermal insulating composition of die invention are reagents capable of providing Zn (II). calcium, magnesium, aluminum. Fe (II). and Fc (III) to the composition. These may be applied directly to the composition as ions or as polyvalent metallic compounds such as hydroxides and chlorides from which the ions may be released.<br>
The crosslinking ions or species may be provided, as indicated, by dissolving into the solution compounds containing the appropriale metals or the metal ion per sc. The concentration of crosslinking agent is dependent on factors such as the temperature in the annuli and will normally range from about 5 ppm to about 2000 ppm. preferably from about 100 ppm to about 900 ppm. It is an important advantage of the invention that higher levels of ihe crosslinking metal ion or metal containing species may be employed, thereby insuring improved crosslinking.   When desired.<br><br>
crosslinking typically occurs after the thermal insulating composition is within the annul i.<br>
Zirconium crosslinkers. such us those described in British Pat. No. 2.108.122. are a preferred class o[ crosslinkers for use herein. Such crosslinkers are preferred because of their "delayed" or "retarded" crosslinking reactivity. This delayed activity is useful because it lets the operator formulate and pump the uncrosslinked composition while it has a relatively lower viscosity which means easier pumping. The delayed systems arc usually designed to crosslink while the fluid is being pumped through the wellbore tubing and/or as the fluid enters into the annuii.<br>
The thermal insulating composition of the invention is prepared on the surface and then pumped through tubing in the wellbore or in the annulus. In a preferred embodiment, the fluid is a packer or riser fluid and the packer'"fund is introduced above the packer in an annulus and the riser fluid is introduced into a riser annulus.<br>
While high viscosity, thickened fluid is highly desirable after the fluid is positioned in the annulus, large amounts of energy are required to pump such fluids through tubing and annular spaces. Crosslinking. when desired, may be delayed, thereby reducing the amount of energy required to pump viscoth fluids through the tubing by permitting pumping of a relatively less viscous fluid having relatively low friction pressures within the well tubing. Crosslinking is typically affected when the fluid is placed in the annulus after which the advantageous properties of thickened crosslinked fluid are then available for thermal insulation.<br>
The composition, when pumped into an annuii surrounding the production tubing or transfer piping, enhances the thermal insulating quality around the tubing or piping, thereby reducing heat loss from it. The composition further pan ides high viscosity at low shear rate so as to reduce the rate of fluid convection to near zero. Since convection is fluid motion caused by the variation of fluid density with temperature, increasing fluid viscosity decreases fluid motion, and correspondingly, decreases free annular convection. Thus, the desired rheological profile for the insulating fluid of the invention includes high viscosity at low shear rate in order to reduce the free fluid convection caused by temperature differential. Additionally, a low viscosity at high shear rate is desired to facilitate the placement of the insulating fluid at the desired location.<br>
The thermal  insulating compositions  should  be approached on  a specific<br><br>
normally dictated by the required hydrostatic pressure needed to control the well, and may be achieved by the amount and type of salt dissolved within the composition (resulting from the brine, etc). The densities of (he thermal insulating compositions of the invention are controlled by operational considerations such as additives to the fluids, hydration time of viscosifier. and requirements for low crystallization temperatures (both true crystallization temperature (TCT) and pressure crystallization temperature (PCT). Densities lo 13.0 pounds per gallon have been evidenced. It is important that the compositions are formulated lo have an appropriate low crystallization temperature for the adverse conditions of deep water. The crosslinked insulating compositions have low pressure crystallization temperatures significantly less than 30°F at 10.000 psi.<br>
The thermal insulating composition of the invention may be produced in shore-based facilities, transported to. and pumped from marine well-servicing boats into riser annuli. This provides a convenient means to blend, temporarily store, and then pump large quantities of fluid into the wellborc and riser annuli. without using rig tanks.<br>
The thermal insulating composition of the invention further offers environmental benefits since no oil sheen will be produced if (lit composition is spilled since the composition is oil-free. Further, while the fluid compositions vary according lo specific well conditions, the components of the composition are environmentally friendly especially since the composition is solids-free.<br>
The composition of the invention may serve a dual purpose. First, they serve lo prevent heat transfer/buildup in the outer annuli. Second, they serve lo retain heal within the produced hydrocarbons. The compositions further provide lower viscosity at high shear rate to facilitate the fluid placement.<br>

Example 2. Example 2 examines the thermal insulation effectiveness of certain fluids using a laboratory-sized heat transfer apparatus.<br>
Two fluids were prepared in accordance with the procedure of Example 1 but using 4 lbs/barrel GM-60 and 4 lbs/barrel HE-100. The thermal insulating properties of thermal insulating fluids were evaluated in a laboratory-sized heat transfer apparatus to determine the thermal effectiveness of the fluids. These fluids were contrasted with pure solvent and ABIF. The heat transfer apparatus consisted of three concentric aluminum pipes connected and scaled by two flanges. The physical dimensions are shown in FIG. 1. Hot fluid at constant temperature was circulated in the inner pipe, while cold fluid at constant temperature was circulated in the outer annulus. The test insulating-fluid was contained in the annulus between the hot and cold reference fluids. The top and bottom of the apparatus were insulated to assure that heat flow was in the radial direction.<br>
About 7000 ml of the fluid was placed into the annulus of a laboratory-sized heat transfer apparatus for the test on each fluid. Hot fluid was allowed to enter the inner pipe at the bottom and leave the pipe at the top at approximately 0.3-1 gallon/minute and thus provided a hot surface at the inner annulus wall. The cold water was fed to the outside pipe of the heat transfer apparatus with a flow rate of 3 gallon/minute to provide a cold wall annulus adjacent to the packer annulus. The test insulating-fluid remained static in the packer annulus. Thermocouples were positioned on the inner wall (hot surface) and outer wall (cold surface) of the annulus. and at the inlet and outlet ports for the hot and cold flowing water.<br>
During the test, hot water and cold water temperatures were set at 1 bS0°F and 50°F. respectively. After thermal equilibrium was achieved (2 to 3 hours) for a given test, data was collected to calculate heat transfer coefficient and apparent thermal conductivity and summarized in Table II:I: III:<br><br><br>
