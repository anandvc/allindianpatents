METHOD OF ALLOCATING RADIO RESOURCES<br>
IN A WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
[DESCREPTION]<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a wireless communication system, and more<br>
particularly, to a method of allocating radio resources in a wireless communication<br>
system.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In a wireless communication system which uses multiple carriers, such as an<br>
orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) or a single carrier-frequency<br>
division multiple access (SC-FDMA), radio resources are a set of continuous sub-<br>
carriers and are defined by a time-frequency region on a two-dimensional sphere. A<br>
time-frequency region is a rectangular form sectioned by time and sub-carrier<br>
coordinates. In other words, one time-frequency region could be a rectangular form<br>
sectioned by at least one symbol on a time axis and a plurality of sub-carriers on a<br>
frequency axis. Such a time-frequency region can be allocated to an uplink for a specific<br>
user equipment (UE), or a base station can transmit the time-frequency region to a<br>
specific user equipment in a downlink. In order to define such a time-frequency region<br>
on the two-dimensional sphere, the number of OFDM symbols and the number of<br>
continuous sub-carriers starting from a point having an offset from a reference point<br>
should be given.<br>
An evolved universal mobile telecommunications system (E-UMTS) which is<br><br>
currently being discussed uses 10 ms radio frame comprising 10 sub-frames. Namely,<br>
one sub-frame includes two continuous slots. One slot has a length of 0.5 ms. Also, one<br>
sub-frame comprises a plurality of OFDM symbols, and a part (for example, first<br>
symbol) of the plurality of OFDM symbols can be used for transmission of L1/L2<br>
control information.<br>
FIG 1 illustrates an example of a structure of physical channels used in the E-<br>
UMTS. In FIG. 1, one sub-frame comprises an L1/L2 control information<br>
transmission region (hatching part) and a data transmission region (non-hatching part).<br>
FIG 2 illustrates a general method of transmitting data in the E-UMTS. In the<br>
E-UMTS, a hybrid auto repeat request (HARQ) scheme, which is one of data<br>
retransmission schemes, is used to improve throughput, thereby enabling desirable<br>
communication.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, the base station transmits downlink scheduling information<br>
(hereinafter, referred to as 'DL scheduling information') through DL L1/L2 control<br>
channel, for example, a physical downlink control channel (PDCCH), to transmit data to<br>
a user equipment in accordance with the HARQ scheme. The DL scheduling<br>
information includes user equipment identifier (UE ID) or group identifier (group ID) of<br>
user equipments, location and duration (resource assignment and duration of<br>
assignment) information of radio resources allocated for transmission of downlink data,<br>
modulation mode, payload size, transmission parameters such as MIMO related<br>
information, HARQ process information, redundancy version, and new data indicator.<br>
In order to notify that DL scheduling information is transmitted through the<br>
PDCCH for what user equipment, the user equipment identifier (or group identifier), for<br>
example, a radio network temporary identifiesr (RNTI) is transmitted. The RNTI can be<br><br>
classified into a dedicated RNTI and a common RNTI. The dedicated RNTI is used<br>
for data transmission and reception to and from a user equipment of which information<br>
is registered with a base station. The common RNTI is used if communication is<br>
performed with user equipments, which are not allocated with dedicated RNTI as their<br>
information is not registered with the base station. Alternatively, the common RNTI is<br>
used for transmission and reception of information used commonly for a plurality of<br>
user equipments, such as system information. For example, examples of the common<br>
RNTI include RA-RNTI and T-C-RNTI, which are used during a random access<br>
procedure through a random access channel (RACH). The user equipment identifier or<br>
group identifier can be transmitted in a type of CRC masking in DL scheduling<br>
information transmitted through the PDCCH.<br>
User equipments located in a specific cell monitor the PDCCH through the<br>
L1/L2 control channel using their RNTI information, and receive DL scheduling<br>
information through the corresponding PDCCH if they successfully perform CRC<br>
decoding through their RNTI. The user equipments receive downlink data transmitted<br>
thereto through a physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) indicated by the received<br>
DL scheduling information.<br>
As described above, in order to efficiently use limited radio resources in the<br>
wireless communication system, uplink scheduling and downlink scheduling are<br>
performed. Particularly, in the system which uses multiple carriers such as OFDMA or<br>
SC-FDMA, since a radio resource block formed by a specific time zone and a specific<br>
frequency band can be used by only one user equipment, scheduling, which determines<br>
how many radio resources are allocated to each user equipment and also determines<br>
when the radio resources are allocated to each user equipment, is very important.<br><br>
For scheduling, the user equipment can perform a buffer status report (BSR)<br>
and a channel resource request. The user equipment can allow a network to efficiently<br>
perform scheduling by notifying the network of data stored in its buffer, through the<br>
buffer status report. The network can perform proper scheduling by identifying what<br>
user equipment needs how many radio resources, using the buffer status report.<br>
Meanwhile, the user equipment can actively request the network to allocate radio<br>
resources.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
A buffer status report and a channel resource request performed by a user<br>
equipment are very important for proper scheduling. Accordingly, the buffer status<br>
report and the channel resource request need to be performed without any error. If an<br>
error occurs during the buffer status report and the channel resource request performed<br>
by the user equipment, radio resources will not be allocated to the user equipment<br>
during scheduling. Since the user equipment is not allocated with radio resources in<br>
spite of data to be transmitted, the user equipment fails to perform smooth<br>
communication.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a method of allocating radio<br>
resources in a wireless communication system, which substantially obviates one or<br>
more problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a method of allocating radio<br>
resources in a wireless communication system, in which radio resources can efficiently<br>
be used in the wireless communication system.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a method of allocating<br><br>
radio resources in a wireless communication system, in which reliability in a buffer<br>
status report and a channel resource request performed by a user equipment can be<br>
enhanced in the wireless communication system.<br>
It is to be understood that the technical solutions to be achieved by the present<br>
invention will not be limited to the aforementioned descriptions, and other technical<br>
solutions will be apparent to those skilled in the art to which the present invention<br>
pertains, from the following detailed description of the present invention.<br>
In one aspect of the present invention, in a wireless communication system, a<br>
user equipment requests a base station to allocate radio resources for uplink data<br>
transmission of at least one time in accordance with a first radio resource allocation<br>
request mode. The user equipment requests the base station to allocate the radio<br>
resources for uplink data transmission in accordance with a second radio resource<br>
allocation request mode if a predetermined condition is satisfied.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, in a wireless communication system,<br>
a user equipment transmits a first buffer status report to a base station, the first buffer<br>
status report indicating a buffer status of a user equipment. The user equipment triggers<br>
a transmission procedure of a second buffer status report in case that allocation<br>
information indicating allocation of radio resources for uplink data transmission is not<br>
received until a predetermined time elapses after the first buffer status report is<br>
transmitted. At this time, the transmission procedure of the second buffer status report<br>
can be performed through a random access procedure or a transmission procedure of a<br>
scheduling request (SR) channel.<br>
According to the present invention, radio resources can efficiently be used in<br>
the wireless communication system, and reliability in the buffer status report and the<br><br>
channel resource request performed by the user equipment can be enhanced.<br>
The advantages of the present invention will not be limited to the<br>
aforementioned description, and it is to be understood that advantages not described will<br>
be apparent to those skilled in the art to which the present invention pertains, from the<br>
description of the present invention.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Hereinafter, structures, operations, and other features of the present invention<br>
will be understood readily by the preferred embodiments of the present invention,<br>
examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Embodiments<br>
described later are examples in which technical features of the present invention are<br>
applied to an E-UMTS (Evolved Universal Mobile Telecommunications System).<br>
FIG 3 illustrates a network structure of an E-UMTS. An E-UMTS is a system<br>
evolving from the conventional WCDMA UMTS and its basic standardization is<br>
currently handled by the 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project). The E-UMTS can<br>
also be called an LTE (Long Term Evolution) system.<br>
Referring to FIG 3, an E-UTRAN includes base stations (hereinafter, referred<br>
to as 'eNode B' or 'eNB'), wherein respective eNBs are connected with each other<br>
through X2 interface. Also, each of eNBs is connected with a user equipment (UE)<br>
through a radio interface and connected with EPC (Evolved Packet Core) through S1<br>
interface. The EPC includes a mobility management entity/system architecture<br>
evolution (MME/SAE) gateway.<br>
Layers of a radio interface protocol between a user equipment and a network<br>
can be classified into a first layer L1, a second layer L2 and a third layer L3 based on<br>
three lower layers of OSI (open system interconnection) standard model widely known<br><br>
in communication systems. A physical layer belonging to the first layer L1 provides<br>
an information transfer service using a physical channel. A radio resource control<br>
(hereinafter, abbreviated as 'RRC') located at the third layer plays a role in controlling<br>
radio resources between the user equipment and the network. For this, the RRC layer<br>
enables RRC messages to be exchanged between the UE and the network. The RRC<br>
layer can be distributively located at network nodes including Node B, an AG and the<br>
like or can be independently located at either the Node B or the AG<br>
FIG 4 is a schematic view illustrating an E-UTRAN (UMTS terrestrial radio<br>
access network). In FIG 4, a hatching part represents functional entities of a user plane,<br>
and a non-hatching part represents functional entities of a control plane.<br>
FIG 5 A and FIG. 5B illustrate a structure of a radio interface protocol between<br>
the user equipment (UE) and the E-UTRAN, in which FIG 5A is a schematic view of a<br>
control plane protocol and FIG. 5B is a schematic view of a user plane protocol.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5A and FIG 5B, a radio interface protocol horizontally includes a<br>
physical layer, a data link layer, and a network layer, and vertically includes a user plane<br>
for data information transfer and a control plane for signaling transfer. The protocol<br>
layers in FIG 5A and FIG. 5B can be classified into L1 (first layer), L2 (second layer),<br>
and L3 (third layer) based on three lower layers of the open system interconnection<br>
(OSI) standard model widely known in the communications systems.<br>
The physical layer as the first layer provides an information transfer service to<br>
an upper layer using physical channels. The physical layer (PHY) is connected to a<br>
medium access control (hereinafter, abbreviated as 'MAC') layer above the physical<br>
layer via transport channels. Data are transferred between the medium access control<br>
layer and the physical layer via the transport channels. Moreover, data are transferred<br><br>
between different physical layers, and more particularly, between one physical layer of a<br>
transmitting side and the other physical layer of a receiving side via the physical<br>
channels. The physical channel of the E-UMTS is modulated in accordance with an<br>
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) scheme, and time and frequency<br>
are used as radio resources.<br>
The medium access control (hereinafter, abbreviated as 'MAC') layer of the<br>
second layer provides a service to a radio link control (hereinafter, abbreviated as<br>
'RLC') layer above the MAC layer via logical channels. The RLC layer of the second<br>
layer supports reliable data transfer. In order to effectively transmit data using IP<br>
packets (e.g., IPv4 or IPv6) within a radio-communication period having a narrow<br>
bandwidth, a PDCP layer of the second layer (L2) performs header compression to<br>
reduce the size of unnecessary control information.<br>
A radio resource control (hereinafter, abbreviated as 'RRC') layer located on a<br>
lowest part of the third layer is defined in the control plane only and is associated with<br>
configuration, reconfiguration and release of radio bearers (hereinafter, abbreviated as<br>
'RBs') to be in charge of controlling the logical, transport and physical channels. In<br>
this case, the RB means a service provided by the second layer for the data transfer<br>
between the user equipment and the UTRAN.<br>
As downlink transport channels carrying data from the network to the user<br>
equipments, there are provided a broadcast channel (BCH) carrying system information,<br>
a paging channel (PCH) carrying paging message, and a downlink shared channel<br>
(SCH) carrying user traffic or control messages. The traffic or control messages of a<br>
downlink multicast or broadcast service can be transmitted via the downlink SCH or an<br>
additional downlink multicast channel (MCH). Meanwhile, as uplink transport<br><br>
channels carrying data from the user equipments to the network, there are provided a<br>
random access channel (RACH) carrying an initial control message and an uplink<br>
shared channel (UL-SCH) carrying user traffic or control message.<br>
As logical channels located above the transport channels and mapped with the<br>
transport channels, there are provided a broadcast control channel (BCCH), a paging<br>
control channel (PCCH), a common control channel (CCCH), a multicast control<br>
channel (MCCH), and a multicast traffic channel (MTCH).<br>
In the E-UMTS system, an OFDM is used on the downlink and a single carrier<br>
frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) on the uplink. The OFDM scheme<br>
using multiple carriers allocates resources by unit of multiple sub-carriers including a<br>
group of carriers and utilizes an orthogonal frequency division multiple access<br>
(OFDMA) as an access scheme.<br>
FIG. 6 is a flow chart illustrating a procedure according to one embodiment of<br>
the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, a user equipment (UE) requests an eNode B (eNB) to<br>
allocate radio resources for uplink data transmission at least one time in accordance<br>
with a first radio resource allocation request mode. Then, if a predetermined condition<br>
which is previously set is satisfied, the UE requests the eNB to allocate the radio<br>
resources for uplink data transmission in accordance with a second radio resource<br>
allocation request mode.<br>
In FIG 6, the first radio resource allocation request mode is a radio resource<br>
allocation request mode using a scheduling request (SR) channel, and the second radio<br>
resource allocation request mode is a radio resource allocation request mode through a<br>
RACH procedure. However, the radio resource allocation request mode will not be<br><br>
limited to the above methods, and the first and second radio resource allocation request<br>
modes could be optional radio resource allocation request modes, respectively.<br>
The SR channel is a physical layer channel used in the LTE system, and is<br>
comprised of 1 bit information. The UE which has been allocated with the SR channel<br>
from the eNB can request the eNB to allocate uplink radio resources by setting the SR<br>
channel to "1", for example. Since the SR channel is comprised of 1 bit information,<br>
error may occur during data transmission. Also, the SR channel can be used in a state<br>
that the UE is synchronized with the eNB. Accordingly, even though the UE has been<br>
allocated with the SR channel, if the UE is asynchronous with the eNB, the UE fails to<br>
successfully perform radio resource request through the SR channel.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, if data to be transmitted to the eNB are generated, the user<br>
equipment (UE) allocated with the SR channel from the eNB transmits the data to the<br>
eNB by setting the SR channel to "1" to request uplink radio resources [S61]. If the UE<br>
should perform a buffer status report (BSR) in a state that the UE is not allocated with<br>
uplink radio resources, the UE can use the SR channel. Also, if data having higher<br>
priority than data stored in the buffer are generated, the UE can use the SR channel.<br>
Moreover, in spite of uplink radio resources previously allocated to the UE, if data to be<br>
transmitted to the eNB are generated additionally or if buffer status is changed, the UE<br>
can transmit 1 bit information to the eNB through the SR channel.<br>
After transmitting the 1 bit information through the SR channel, the UE makes<br>
a timer T1 operate. The driving time of the timer could be either the transmission time<br>
of the 1 bit information or the time when ACK for the 1 bit information is received. If<br>
the UE is not allocated with radio resources from the eNB until the timer ends, the UE<br>
transmits the 1 bit information to the eNB through the SR channel to request radio<br><br>
resource allocation [S62], and makes the timer operate again.<br>
If the UE is allocated with uplink radio resources from the eNB as above, the<br>
UE terminates transmission of the 1 bit information and transmits uplink data to the<br>
eNB through the allocated radio resources. If the UE is not allocated with the radio<br>
resources from the eNB even after it repeats the above procedure a predetermined<br>
number of times which are previously set [S63], the user equipment performs a random<br>
access procedure (RACH procedure) to request the eNB to allocate the radio resources<br>
[S64]. In this case, the UE releases a call or notifies the eNB that an error has occurred<br>
together with or separately from the RACH procedure. The transmission period (or<br>
timer (Tl) value) of the 1 bit information through the SR channel or the predetermined<br>
number of times can be reported to the UE in such a manner that it is included in system<br>
information or dedicated RRC message etc, which is previously transmitted from the<br>
eNB.<br>
A modification example of FIG. 6 will be described below. In step S61, the UE<br>
makes the timer operate after transmitting the SR channel. The UE repeatedly transmits<br>
the SR channel until it is allocated with uplink channel resources before the timer ends.<br>
At this time, the SR channel can be transmitted periodically. If the UE is not allocated<br>
with uplink channel resources before the timer ends, the UE performs the RACH<br>
procedure to request allocation of uplink channel resources.<br>
FIG 7 is a flow chart illustrating a procedure according to another embodiment<br>
of the present invention. According to the embodiment of FIG. 7, a user equipment (UE)<br>
performs a buffer status report (BSR) to an eNB.<br>
The BSR is performed so that the UE reports its buffer status to the eNB. FIG.<br>
8A and FIG. 8B illustrate data formats of a short BSR and a long BSR, respectively. In<br><br>
FIG 8A, LCG ID means a logical channel group identifier. The UE can group<br>
maximum four logical channels in one logical channel group and report buffer status of<br>
the logical channel group. In this way, if the buffer status report is performed for each<br>
logical channel group through grouping, overhead that may occur can be reduced. The<br>
eNB can notify the UE of the grouping method for the logical channels. The long BSR<br>
of FIG 8B includes four buffer size fields corresponding to LCG ID #1 to LCG ID #4.<br>
Each buffer size field includes a size of all data, which are standby for transmission in<br>
the RLC layer and the PDCP layer included in the corresponding logical channel group.<br>
The BSR of FIG. 8A or FIG. 8B can be included in MAC PDU (MAC protocol<br>
data unit) to be transmitted. Namely, the BSR is included in a BSR control element,<br>
which is one of control elements of a MAC PDU generated in the MAC layer.<br>
FIG. 9 A to FIG. 9C are diagrams illustrating a format of the MAC PDU. In FIG.<br>
9A to FIG 9C, an LCID field includes information indicating a logical channel through<br>
which a corresponding MAC SDU (MAC service data unit) is transferred or a type of<br>
information in a corresponding MAC control element. An LCID field corresponding to<br>
a BSR control element identifies whether the corresponding BSR is a short BSR or a<br>
long BSR. An extension (E) field includes information indicating whether another MAC<br>
subheader follows right after a corresponding MAC subheader. An F field includes<br>
information indicating a length of an L field following the F field. A reserved (R) field is<br>
a field which is reserved.<br>
If a certain condition is satisfied, the buffer status report procedure is triggered<br>
in the UE. At this time, if there are radio resources allocated to the UE, the UE transmits<br>
the BSR through the allocated radio resources. If there are no radio resources allocated<br>
to the UE and an SR channel has been established, the UE transmits 1 bit information to<br><br>
the eNB through the SR channel. If the SR channel has not been established, the UE<br>
transmits the BSR to the eNB via the RACH procedure. If the UE transmitting uplink<br>
data using allocated uplink radio resources shifts to a state in which there are no radio<br>
resources, the UE can perform the BSR transmission procedure using the SR channel or<br>
the RACH procedure. At this time, it is preferable that the BSR transmission procedure<br>
starts after a predetermined time elapses from the time when the UE identifies its buffer<br>
status. If the UE is allocated with radio resources from the eNB before the<br>
predetermined time elapses, the UE transmits the BSR through the allocated radio<br>
resources without performing the SR channel transmission procedure or the RACH<br>
procedure.<br>
Referring to FIG 7, if the MAC layer of the UE commands its physical layer to<br>
initiate the random access procedure, the physical layer of the UE first selects an access<br>
slot and a signature and then transmits a random access preamble to the eNB [S71].<br>
If the UE transmits the preamble, the eNB transmits a response message<br>
through a downlink physical channel (for example, AICH (Acquisition indicator<br>
channel)) [S72]. In response to the preamble, a signature corresponding to the preamble<br>
is transmitted on the AICH for a first certain length of an access slot corresponding to<br>
the access slot to which the preamble is transmitted. The eNB allocates uplink radio<br>
resources (UL grant) to the UE through the RACH response message. The uplink radio<br>
resource is an uplink shared channel (UL-SCH). The UE transmits the MAC PDU,<br>
which includes the BSR, using the allocated radio resources, a message size, and a radio<br>
parameter included in the RACH response message [S73]. If the eNB receives the MAC<br>
PDU transmitted from the UE, the eNB transmits ACK/NACK or a contention<br>
resolution message to the UE [S74].<br><br>
If it is identified that the MAC PDU, which includes the BSR, has been<br>
successfully transmitted, for example, if the UE receives ACK or a contention<br>
resolution message including an identifier of the UE from the eNB, the UE makes a<br>
timer (T2) operate. If the uplink radio resources are allocated from the eNB to the UE<br>
before the timer terminates, the UE transmits data stored in its buffer to the eNB by<br>
using the allocated radio resources.<br>
If the UE is not allocated with the uplink radio resources from the eNB until<br>
the timer terminates, the UE realizes that the BSR transmission through the RACH<br>
procedure has been failed, and triggers a new BSR procedure. Namely, the UE performs<br>
the RACH procedure again [S75] to initiate BSR transmission. Otherwise, if the SR<br>
channel is established in the UE, the UE is allocated with radio resources by<br>
transmitting the 1 bit information through the established SR channel and then transmits<br>
the BSR through the allocated radio resources.<br>
If the UE is informed from the eNB so as not to perform the BSR transmission<br>
procedure, the SR channel transmission procedure, or the RACH procedure any more,<br>
the UE terminates the timer (T2), or does not trigger the BSR transmission procedure<br>
even though the timer expires.<br>
The embodiment of FIG 7 will be described in more general. The UE transmits<br>
a first BSR to the eNB, wherein the first BSR indicates the buffer status of the UE. If<br>
the UE fails to receive allocation information until a predetermined time period, which<br>
is previously set, passes after successfully transmitting the first BSR, wherein the<br>
allocation information indicates allocation of radio resources for uplink data<br>
transmission, the UE triggers a transmission procedure of a second BSR. At this time,<br>
the transmission procedure of the second BSR can be performed through the RACH<br><br>
procedure or the transmission procedure of the SR channel. If the SR channel is<br>
periodically established in the UE, it is preferable that the UE performs the BSR<br>
transmission procedure using more quickly allocated radio resources among radio<br>
resources for RACH preamble transmission and radio resources for SR channel.<br>
FIG 10 is a flow chart illustrating a procedure according to another<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 10, a user equipment (UE) transmits 1 bit information to an<br>
eNB (eNB) on an SR channel to perform a buffer status report (BSR) [S101]. If the eNB<br>
receives the 1 bit information from the UE through the SR channel, the eNB allocates<br>
uplink radio resources, for example, UL-SCH, to the UE [S102]. The UE transmits a<br>
MAC PDU including the BSR, to the eNB through the allocated radio resources [S103].<br>
If the eNB successfully receives the MAC PDU, the eNB transmits ACK to the<br>
UE [S104]. If the UE receives ACK, the UE makes a timer (T3) operate and waits for<br>
allocation of uplink radio resources until the timer expires to transmit uplink data stored<br>
in its buffer. If the UE is allocated with uplink radio resources from the eNB before the<br>
timer expires, the UE transmits uplink data to the eNB through the allocated uplink<br>
radio resources. If the UE is not allocated with uplink radio resources from the eNB<br>
until the timer expires, the UE transmits the SR channel or the RACH procedure to<br>
perform the BSR procedure again [S105]. In FIG. 10, the UE may make the timer (T3)<br>
operate from the time when the UE transmits the BSR in step S103.<br>
FIG. 11 is a flow chart illustrating a procedure according to another<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG 11, a user equipment (UE) transmits a MAC PDU, which<br>
includes the BSR, to an eNB through an SR channel, the RACH procedure, or the<br><br>
previously allocated uplink radio resources [S111]. If the eNB fails to successfully<br>
receive the MAC PDU transmitted from the UE, the eNB transmits NACK to the UE<br>
[S112]. If an error occurs during the transmission procedure of NACK, the UE receives<br>
ACK [S112]. Although the UE determines that it has successfully transmitted the BSR<br>
and waits for allocation of uplink radio resources, since the eNB has been failed to<br>
successfully receive the BSR, the uplink radio resources are not allocated to the UE<br>
actually. Alternatively, even though the eNB has successfully received the BSR, if there<br>
are no available radio resources, the eNB does not allocate radio resources to the UE.<br>
In this case, the UE checks whether there are radio resources allocated to all<br>
HARQ processes established in the UE [S114], and drives a timer (T4) if there are no<br>
radio resources allocated to the HARQ processes. If the UE is allocated with radio<br>
resources from the eNB before the timer expires, the UE terminates the timer. If the UE<br>
is not allocated with radio resources from the eNB until the timer expires, the UE<br>
transmits 1 bit information through the SR channel or triggers the buffer status report<br>
(BSR) by performing the RACH procedure [S115].<br>
In the embodiment of FIG. 11, that there are radio resources allocated to a<br>
specific HARQ process means that data to be transmitted to the eNB remain in a HARQ<br>
buffer of the corresponding HARQ process. Alternatively, that there are radio resources<br>
allocated to the specific HARQ process means that, after radio resources for initial data<br>
transmission are allocated to the HARQ process, retransmission does not occur in the<br>
HARQ process as much as the maximum number of retransmission times and feedback<br>
most recently received with respect to the HARQ process is NACK. Or, that there are<br>
radio resources allocated to the specific HARQ process may mean that radio resources<br>
for initial data transmission are allocated to the HARQ process.<br><br>
According to another embodiment of the present invention, it is considered that<br>
an SR channel is used for another purpose. Namely, although the SR channel is used to<br>
request allocation of radio resources to an eNB, if a predetermined event occurs, a UE<br>
can report its status to the eNB by transmitting the 1 bit information to the eNB through<br>
the SR channel even though there are radio resources allocated from the eNB.<br>
Alternatively, the UE can use the SR channel to transmit a response message to a radio<br>
resource allocation message transmitted from the eNB. For the above examples, in<br>
addition to the SR channel, another physical channel of at least 1 bit or greater<br>
information can be established.<br>
An example of the predetermined event corresponds to a status where data to<br>
be transmitted to the eNB do not remain in the buffer of the UE any more in a state that<br>
there are radio resources allocated to the UE.<br>
Another example of the predetermined event corresponds to a status where a<br>
radio bearer, which does not satisfy quality of service (QoS), exists in the UE. For<br>
example, a maximum bit rate (MBR) or a prioritized bit rate (PBR) can be set per<br>
logical channel of the UE. In this case, if MBR or PBR set with respect to a specific<br>
radio bearer is not satisfied, the UE can report it through the SR channel. The MBR<br>
means an amount of maximum data that can be transmitted to a lower layer per<br>
transmission time interval (TTI) for each logical channel, and the PBR means an<br>
amount of minimum data.<br>
Other example of the predetermined event corresponds to a status where data<br>
of a specific logical channel designated by the eNB arrive in the buffer. Namely, if data<br>
of a specific logical channel designated by the eNB are generated in the UE, the UE can<br>
report it to the eNB through the SR channel.<br><br>
Another embodiment of the present invention will be described below. Since an<br>
SR channel is a channel of 1 bit information, even though the UE has neither requested<br>
allocation of radio resources through the SR channel nor transmitted the BSR, the eNB<br>
may misunderstand that it has received the 1 bit information for channel resource<br>
request through the SR channel, due to error occurred during the transmission procedure.<br>
In this case, the eNB transmits an allocation message of uplink radio resources to the<br>
UE. If the UE receives the allocation message of uplink radio resources from the eNB,<br>
the UE transmits the BSR using the allocated radio resources. Meanwhile, if an extra<br>
space exists in the MAC PDU, which includes the BSR, the UE can transmit RRC<br>
measurement report or RLC status report to the eNB. In this case, the RRC<br>
measurement report and the RLC status report are transmitted in such a manner that<br>
they are included in the MAC PDU.<br>
The aforementioned embodiments are achieved by combination of structural<br>
elements and features of the present invention in a predetermined type. Each of the<br>
structural elements or features should be considered selectively unless specified<br>
otherwise. Each of the structural elements or features may be carried out without being<br>
combined with other structural elements or features. Also, some structural elements<br>
and/or features may be combined with one another to constitute the embodiments of the<br>
present invention. The order of operations described in the embodiments of the<br>
present invention may be changed. Some structural elements or features of one<br>
embodiment may be included in another embodiment, or may be replaced with<br>
corresponding structural elements or features of another embodiment. Moreover, it will<br>
be apparent that some claims referring to specific claims may be combined with another<br>
claims referring to the other claims other than the specific claims to constitute the<br><br>
embodiment or add new claims by means of amendment after the application is filed.<br>
The embodiments of the present invention have been described based on data<br>
transmission and reception between the eNB and the UE. A specific operation which has<br>
been described as being performed by the eNB may be performed by an upper node of<br>
the eNB as the case may be. In other words, it will be apparent that various operations<br>
performed for communication with the UE in the network which includes a plurality of<br>
network nodes along with the eNB may be performed by the eNB or network nodes<br>
other than the eNB. The eNB may be replaced with terms such as a fixed station, base<br>
station, Node B, eNode B, and access point. Also, the user equipment (UE) may be<br>
replaced with terms such as mobile station (MS) and mobile subscriber station (MSS).<br>
