				<td>NAME OF THE APPLICANT: Ms. JAYANTHI JAYACHNADRA RAO 7. ABSTRACT OF THE INVENTION An integrated lifting arrangement as two point linkage to attach and lift any implement to a vehicle is simple, very economical and time saving in vehicles or stationery machineries. This implement (10) lift arrangement consists of a Hand operated hydraulic device (3) connected to of a jack or Hydraulic RAM cylinder (8) through a Hydraulic non-return valve (6) and a hydraulic hose (7). The piston RAM cylinder (9) of the jack or Hydraulic RAM cylinder is located right under the half round metal pad (17) which is an integral part of the lift arm side bars (11) of two point linkage (22). The piston RAM cylinder (9) of the Hydraulic RAM cylinder (8) gets lifted when the lever hydraulic device (5) is pressed by the driver sitting in his seat. Since overhang distance of the lift arm side bars (11) or the distance (y) between the half round pad (17) and the implement attaching snap pins (15) is larger as compared to the distance (x) between hitch pin lift arms (13) and the half round metal pad (17), the lift leverage of piston RAM cylinder from a zero level height (A) to (A1) on the two point linkage (22) at the point of half round metal pad (17) effects in larger lift of the implement (10) from (B) to (B1) proportionately to the ratio of the distance (y) between implement mounting snap pins [(15),(15)] and half round metal pad (17), and the distance (x) between half round metal pad (17) and the two hitch pins [(13), (13)]. The implement (10) is lowered from height (Bl) to (B) by opening the hydraulic nonreturn valve (6) when the hydraulic fluid flows back from the hydraulic RAM cylinder (8) to the hand operated hydraulic device (3) thus bringing back the half round metal pad (17) from a height of (Al) to (A) resulted by the gravity of the implement (10).</td>

3.	PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
COMPLETE<br>
The following specification particularly describes the<br>
invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br>
Title of the invention:<br>
An integrated lifting arrangement as two point linkage to attach and lift any implement to a vehicle.<br>
Field of the invention:<br>
This invention is related to the field of implement lift in any moving vehicle or any stationary machinery. Implement attachment means any external device which has to be attached to the vehicle or machinery in-order to get the desired work done. The vehicle or the machinery on which these attachments are fitted or hitched or hinged is called as prime movers. The implement attachment thus gets necessary power from the prime mover in order to deliver the desired work. Examples of moving vehicles with implements are "Power sweeper with sweeper attachment" or "tractors with any agricultural implement". Examples of stationery machineries are cranes.<br>
Background of the invention or problem with the prior art:<br>
So far, implement lift is generally achieved using a hydraulic pump driven by a prime-mover. This pump supplies hydraulic fluid to control valve under pressure. This control valve, when operated, supplies hydraulic fluid to ram cylinders under controlled pressure. Piston within the ram cylinder is connected to lift arms or side lift bars through mechanical fulcrums called side vertical links and these lift arms are attached to implements to achieve implement lift.<br>
This arrangement is known as 3 point linkage lifting mechanism to attach and lift any implement to a vehicle.<br>
And thus, cost of this arrangement for implement lift is much higher. The 3 point linkage consists of 2 adjustable side vertical links, 2 side horizontal bars, 2 adjustable check chains, and one adjustable top link arrangement. This arrangement not only ads up to the cost but also adds up human hardship <br>
during implement attachment.<br><br>
Summery of the invention:<br>
This invention provides a suitable solution for the problems mentioned in the prior art. With this invention, the implement is lifted by a simple hand-operated hydraulic device. This hand operated hydraulic device is located near the driver seat. This hand operated hydraulic device is operated manually through a lever hydraulic device. While on operation, this hand operated hydraulic device supplies hydraulic fluid to the hydraulic jack or known as hydraulic RAM cylinder through a hydraulic non-return valve and through hydraulic hose. The hydraulic jack or hydraulic RAM cylinder is located under the cross bar rear in lift arm side bars close to the hitching or hitch pin lift arms when inserted into U clamp in chassis and right under the half round metal pad. When the lever hydraulic device in the hand operated hydraulic device is pressed, hydraulic fluid flows to the jack or hydraulic RAM cylinder under pressure through hydraulic non-return valve and the hydraulic hose. The piston RAM cylinder of this jack or hydraulic RAM cylinder is in constant contact with the half round metal pad situated under the cross bar rear and this point is close to the hitch pin lift arms or hinge point in chassis. The overhang distance of the lift arm side bars between this half round metal pad and the implement attaching snap pins is more than the distance between hitch pin lift arms or hinge point and the half round metal pad. Thus the lift leverage attained at a point of half round metal pad by the piston RAM cylinder of the hydraulic jack or hydraulic RAM cylinder is multiplied and the implement lift is larger in height than the lift height affected at the half round metal pad. This implement lift height is in proportion to the distance between hitch pin lift arms and the half round metal pad, and the distance between half round metal pad and the implement attaching snap pins. The implement can be held in its position at any time in any lifted height. This is because the hydraulic fluid is prevented by flowing back to the fluid reservoir in hand operated hydraulic device by the hydraulic non return valve.<br>
The implement can easily be lowered as and when required by opening the hydraulic non return valve in the hand operated hydraulic device. This Hydraulic non-return valve is also located near the driver seat and this hydraulic non-return valve is an integral part of the hand operated hydraulic device itself. When the hydraulic non-return valve is opened the hydraulic fluid flows back to the fluid reservoir in the hand operated hydraulic device and because of the gravity the implement gets lowered.<br>
The parallelism of the implement is achieved by using two simple parallel steel rods between the hitch pin lift arms and the implement. These parallel steel rods are pivoted parallel to the lift arm side bars but below the hitch pin lift arms at the rear end and below the implement attaching snap pins in the lift arm side bars in the front end simultaneously. These simple parallel steel rods are fitted or<br><br>
hooked on to the implement. This mechanism operates mechanically and is simple. This does not require any other linkages like three point linkage or hydraulic linkages or electrical support. Therefore, this mechanism avoids the entire time involved otherwise in fixing the 3 point linkage. This also reduces the material requirement to a very large extent and reduces the cost.<br>
List-of preferred and optional features:<br>
In the normal form of the invention there are two symmetrical lift arm side bars. Front end of both these lift arm side bars are connected or attached to the implement through impalement attaching snap pins. The back end of both these lifts arm side bars are hitched to the vehicle chassis at two points through hitch pin lift arms. These lift arm side bars are connected to each other by one cross bar welded to lift arm side bars near the hitch pin lift arms point at the rear and one more cross bar is welded to these lift arm side bars close to the implement attaching snap pins at the front. The jack or Hydraulic RAM cylinder is provided under the half round metal pad located at the bottom of rear cross bar. There are also two symmetrical parallel steel rods fitted or hooked between implement and the hitch pin lift arms point just below hitch pin lift arms in the U Clamp chassis at the rear and implement attaching snap pin point at the front. These Parallel steel rods are parallel to the lift arm side bars. This mechanism prevents the implement from oscillation when lifted or being lifted.<br>
In another form, the same lift arm side bars are used where one end of the lift arm side bar is connected to the implement using implement attaching snap pins and the other end is hitched to the vehicle chassis using hitch pin lift arms inserted into U Clamp in chassis. The rear end and the front end of the lift arm side bars are welded with cross bars as said above. The jack or the hydraulic RAM cylinder is provided below the half round metal pad of lift arm side bars close to the hitch point or hitch pin lift arms. These lift arm side bars are welded with small metal plates called as side stopper plate front at the front at a point close to the implement as stoppers. The size and thickness of these side stopper plate front depends upon the size and weight of the implement. These side stopper plate front which are in constant touch with the implement prevent the implement from oscillation.<br>

Detailed description of the invention with reference to drawings:<br>
Referring the figures said above, the vehicle chassis (1) has a seat mounting rear column (2) on which the driver seat (4) is mounted. The hand operated hydraulic device (3) is located near the driver seat (4) on the right hand side of the driver seat. This hand operated hydraulic device also consists of a reservoir for hydraulic fluid. This hand operated hydraulic device is operated through a lever hydraulic device (5). The hydraulic hose (7) is taken from this hand operated hydraulic device (3) through the hydraulic non-return valve (6) in the hand operated hydraulic device (3) and connected to the jack or hydraulic RAM cylinder (8). This jack or hydraulic RAM cylinder (8) is located in the front side of the vehicle chassis (1) away from the driver's seat. The piston RAM cylinder (9) of this jack or hydraulic RAM cylinder (8) is located right under the half round metal pad (17) of the Cross bar rear (18) of lift arm side bars (11) or two point linkage (22). This half round metal pad (17) is welded at the bottom of the cross bar rear (18) of the lift arm side bars (11). This half round metal pad (17) is located at a distance (x) close to the hinge point or hitch pin lift arms. These hitch pin lift arms (13) are inserted in to U clamps in chassis (21) in the chassis (1). The front end of the lift arm side bars (11) connected to each other through a front cross bar (19) welded to each lift arms (11) at the front. The implement (10) is attached to the lift arm side bars (11) or two point linkage (22) at the front end with implement attaching snap pins (15) at a distance (y) from the half round metal pad (17). Such that, the rear end of the lift arm side bars or two point linkage (22) is hinged or hitched to chassis with hitch pin lift arms (13) inserted into the U Clamp in chassis (21) in the chassis (1). Thus the implement (10) is now hinged or hitched or connected to the chassis U clamp in chassis<br><br>
(21) through hitch pin lift arms (13) of two point linkage (22). The distance (x) is maintained much lesser than the distance (y).<br>
There are also two additional parallel steel rods (12), rear end of which are pivoted or hooked to the chassis through hook parallel rods (14) below the implement hinge point or hitch pin lift arms (13) in the U clamp in chassis (21). The other end of these parallel steel rods (12) are pivoted or hooked to the implement (10) below the implement attaching snap pins (15) through pin parallel bar pivot front (16). The distance between the lift arm side bars (11) and these parallel steel rods (12) are symmetrical and identical at both front and rear ends of the lift arm side bars (11) and are in equal distance to hinge or hitch pin lift arms (13) and implement attaching snap pins (15).<br>
Thus, when lever hydraulic device (5) is manually pressed down the hydraulic fluid flows from the inbuilt reservoir of hand operated hydraulic device (3) under pressure to the jack or hydraulic RAM cylinder (8) through a hydraulic non-return valve (6) and hydraulic hose (7). Now the piston RAM cylinder (9) within the jack or hydraulic RAM cylinder (8) gets lifted up. This lift corresponds to the down stroke of the lever hydraulic device (5). Since the piston RAM cylinder (9) is right under the half round metal pad (17) of the lift arm side bars (11), lift arm side bars (11) gets lifted along with the implement (10) attached to these lift arm side bars.<br>
Since the piston RAM cylinder (9) is kept under the half round metal pad (17) close to the hinge point or hitch pin lift arms (13) at a distance (x) and since the distance (y) between the half round metal pad (17) and the implement attaching snap pins (15) on the front end of the lift arm (11) is more than distance (x), the mechanical leverage of this piston RAM cylinder lift to a smaller height (Al) at the half round metal pad (17) from the zero height (A) of chassis level effects in much higher corresponding lift (B1) of the implement (10) from the zero level height (B) from ground. Thus the implement (10) can be easily lifted with few strokes of the lever hydraulic device (5).<br>
Since the parallel steel rods (12) are symmetrically pivoted below the hinge point or hitch pins lift arms (13) and the implement attaching snap pins (15) in equal distance, these parallel steel rods (12) act as a parallelogram between the implement attaching snap pins (15) and the hinge point or hitch pin lift arms (13) in the chassis (1). This parallelogram prevents the implement from oscillation when being lifted or even after getting lifted. This oscillation of the implement is also prevented by welding simple metal plate called side stopper plate front (20) to the lift arm side bars (11) close to the implement attaching snap pins (15) which is in constant contact with the implement (10).<br><br>
The implement (10) can be easily lowered by opening the hydraulic non-return valve (6) which is located near the driver's seat on the right hand side ofthe driver seat (4). While opening the hydraulic non-return valve, hydraulic fluid flows back to the hydraulic reservoir in hand operated hydraulic device (3) through the same hydraulic hose (7) and same hydraulic non-return valve (6) because of the implement weight. The closing of hydraulic non-return valve (6) again renders the entire system ready to operate and thus implement can be lifted as and when required by pressing the lever hydraulic device (5).<br>
This arrangement is entirely different than the 3 point linkage-TPL as shown in Figure 10 &amp; 11 of additional sheets 11. The 3 point linkage-TPL (27) consists of several independent components such as 2 side horizontal bars-TPL (25), 2 adjustable check chains-TPL (26), 2 adjustable side vertical links-TPL (24) and one adjustable top link-TPL (23). All these components when assembled simultaneously on to a vehicle forms into a 3 point linkage.<br>
Whereas, the new two point linkage (22) explained herein above in the detailed description of the invention is a single integrated lifting arrangement. This integrated two point linkage consists of two lift arm side bars (11) welded with; one cross bar rear (18), one cross bar front (19), one metal pad (17), two hitch pin lift arms [(13), (13)] and two side stopper plate front [(20), (20)] together to form a single integrated unit (22).<br>
Modifications may be made to the to the embodiments described herein, including modifications of and / or substitution of equivalents for one or more of the devices or components which have been illustrated and described, without departing from the scope of the invention.<br><br>
