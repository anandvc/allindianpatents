HFART ASSIST DEVICES SYSTEMS AND MFTHODS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to heart assist devices, systems and methods.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Currently the only real options for improvement of end-stage heart failure are<br>
medical therapy, left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) and transplantation. ACE<br>
(Angiotensin Converting Enzyme) inhibitors unload the heart and prolong survival.<br>
LVADs pump blood and significantly improve life style and survival, but are complicated<br>
to implant, maintain and remove, with relatively high complications relating to bleeding,<br>
infection, thromboembolism, and device malfunction.	,<br>
The transplant rate has stabilised at approximately 2,300 per year in the USA,<br>
being limited by organ availability. Transplantation achieves a 75% five year survival<br>
rate and a 65% ten year survival rate with significant improvements in functional class.<br>
The number of people awaiting heart transplantation is steadily increasing and<br>
they are a sicker group, with increasing numbers requiring hospitalisation, intravenous<br>
ionotropes, short-term percutaneous trans-femoral intra-aortic balloon pumping and/or<br>
LVAD implantation.<br>
The Institute of Medicine has estimated that by the year 2010, up to 70,000<br>
patients will be candidates for permanent mechanical circulatory support systems.<br>
Over the last ten years, LVADs have been well proven to save lives, acting as<br>
bridges to transplantation for critically ill patients. Recently, LVADs have been<br>
considered as alternatives to transplantation, and very recently, have been explanted in a<br>
few patients who have shown recovery. This latest realisation is starting to gather a lot of<br>
interest as researchers focus on recovery of the failing heart. LVADs totally unload the<br>
left ventricle and many believe that the heart will then recover. Moreover there is<br>
evidence beyond the few patients in whom devices have been removed that there is<br>
reversal in markers of heart failure. On the other hand, others have described an increase<br>
in myocardial fibrosis which raises a question of whether the heart is being unloaded too<br>
much.<br><br><br>
deflated in counter-pulsation with the heart beat. Inflation in diastole causes a diastolic<br>
pressure augmentation and increases coronary artery blood flow and deflating in systole<br>
(triggered by the R wave of the ECG) reduces the afterload, or the pressure head against<br>
which the left ventricle has to eject blood. Early investigators determined that the best<br>
and most efficient balloon position was closest to the heart, i.e., in the ascending aorta.<br>
However, in recent times, the balloon is positioned via the femoral artery in the<br>
descending aorta for short term (1-10 days) use. There is substantial proof beyond doubt<br>
that counterpulsation works very well in the short-term to assist hearts to recover when<br>
drugs (ionotropes etc.) are insufficient or inappropriate to support the cardiovascular<br>
system.<br>
Intra-aortic balloon heart pumps operating in counterpulsation assist the heart<br>
function. When inflated, the balloon propels blood peripherally from within the aorta to<br>
improve blood circulation in the patient. Moreover, more blood is forced into the<br>
coronary arteries to help nourish and strengthen the heart muscle. However, the balloon<br>
comes into direct contact with the blood flowing into the aorta, which can cause damage<br>
to the blood cells and there is a risk of thromboembolism. In addition, current intra-aortic<br>
balloon pump systems are inflated by means of a tube passing through the body, the lube<br>
connecting the balloon to an external compressor. The opening for the tube to enter the<br>
body provides a possible site of infection or other injury. The tube is typically inserted<br>
into a groin vessel, the femoral artery, and there is a high risk of associated leg<br>
complications. Further, the patient is bedridden and cannot mobilize. Additionally, the<br>
use of a gas to inflate the balloon is not an entirely safe operation since any leakage of gas<br>
from the balloon into the blood stream could cause an air embolus.<br>
Aortic compression (periaortic diastolic compression) has been described as a<br>
means to increase coronary blood flow. For example, US Patent No. 4,583,523 describes<br>
an implantable heart assist device including an elongated assembly extending transversely<br>
between the ribs of a patient from the rib cage to the aorta of the heart to be assisted. The<br>
assembly includes an aorta compressing device at the front end and a mounting device at<br>
the rear end thereof to support the device from the ribs of the patient. A motive device<br>
actuates and deactivates the compressing device alternatively to help pump blood through<br>
the aorta in a counterpulsation mode of operation. Although this device has advantages<br>
for many applications, it docs require relatively complicated surgery to implanl/explant<br>
the device, particularly in regard to the need to mount the device, including its motive<br><br>
more noticeable to the patient. There is also substantial risk of infection with the device<br>
coming through the skin. Furthermore, because the device is attached/mounted, to the<br>
ribs, there may be shear stresses on the aorta as the rib cage moves with<br>
inspiration/expiration. These stresses may cause untoward damage of the aorta.<br>
US Patent No. 4,979,936 discloses an autologous biologic pump in the form of<br>
an apparatus using skeletal muscle formed into a pouch which then surrounds a<br>
collapsible, shape-retaining bladder. The bladder is connected to a second bladder<br>
enclosed in a sheath around a portion of the aorta. The bladders are filled with a fluid<br>
such that when the skeletal muscle contracts in response to an electrical stimulation, the<br>
fluid is forced from the first bladder into the second bladder sheathed around the aorta,<br>
expanding that second bladder and forcing the aorta to compress. Although" this approach<br>
may be useful in some circumstances, it is doubtful that it is suitable for long term in that<br>
the muscle function would probably degrade over time. Furthermore, the muscle has to<br>
be "trained" for many weeks before the device can be relied on to assist blood circulation.<br>
WO 99/04833 discloses a cardiac ventricle aid device which is implanted in the<br>
abdominal cavity with an aorta sleeve tube placed on, or inserted in, the descending aorta.<br>
A disadvantage of the disclosed device is it has a separate actuator and compliance<br>
chamber and its implantation is thus complicated. Another disadvantage is it is difficult<br>
to securely mount the device components to a structure in the abdominal cavity that is<br>
capable of supporting its weight. A further disadvantage is a number of vertebral arteries<br>
stem from the descending aorta which can be damaged during the implantation of the<br>
device.<br>
It would be desirable to have a heart assist device that could be quickly and<br>
totally implanted in a relatively easy manner and with minimum trauma to the patient and<br>
to allow ambulation with low risk of complications. Also desirable would be a heart<br>
assist device that allows partial unloading of the heart longterm, augmenting the cardiac<br>
output of the native heart, and possibly allowing substantial recovery of the heart so that<br>
the device could be weaned. Moreover, it would be desirable for such a device to have no<br>
blood contacting surfaces, and not require cardiopulmonary bypass to implant the device.<br>
In a small proportion of patients however there will exist aortic disease making a<br>
periaortic device unsuitable. In these patients it would be desirable to be able to apply the<br>
same aortic counterpulsation, but with a device that replaces the ascending aorta <br><br>
cardiac output of the native heart, and possibly allowing substantial recovery of the heart<br>
so that the device could be weaned.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to satisfy one or more of the above<br>
desirable criteria.<br>

In a seventh aspect, the present invention provides a human or animal having a<br>
heart assist device according to any one of the preceding. aspects of (the invention<br>
implanted therein<br><br>
In a further aspect, the present invention provides an implantable system for<br>
assisting the functioning of the heart of a subject, the system including:<br>
an implantable device for assisting the functioning of the heart of a subject,<br>
including:<br>
means for externally engaging and compressing the aorta;<br>
motive means responsive to control signal(s) for actuating and de-activating the<br>
compressing means cyclically to help blood pump through the aorta, wherein the<br>
compressing means and the motive means are fully implantable within the thoracic cavity<br>
of the subject and wherein the compressing means and/or motive means include means<br>
adapted for attachment to the aorta and/or surrounding tissue within the thoracic cavity of<br>
the subject;<br>
sensing means adapted for sensing the heart and generating sensing signals;<br>
control means responsive to the sensing signals for generating the control<br>
signal(s); and<br>
a power source for providing power to the motive means.<br>
The device of the invention may operate in countersynchronisation to the heart<br>
(counterpulsation).<br>
An advantage of the device and system of the present invention is that the risk of<br>
limb ischemia associated with conventional IAB systems is avoided because there is no<br>
blood contact with the device whatsoever. Patient ambulation is also possible.<br>
Additionally the implantation technique used for the device of the invention is less<br>
invasive than those required for other devices. In particular, compared to the arrangement<br>
taught in US Patent No. 4,583,523, the device of the present invention provides a belter<br>
outcome in term of reduced risk of infection, cosmesis and ease of implant and explant.<br>
A further advantage of the device and system of the present invention is that there is little<br>
risk to the patient in the event of device failure. The device has the great advantage of<br>
being able to be weaned and turned off in the event of cardiac recovery. This is simply<br>
not possible with known LVADs. Furthermore if the heart shows signs of relapsing back<br>
into failure, the device can be switched back on.<br>
The compressing means of the device of the present invention preferably<br>
includes a preshaped balloon cuff for wrapping around a portion of the aorta. Preferably,<br>
the balloon is configured longitudinally to fit the curve, that of a circular or oval arc, of<br>
the ascending aorta. In a particularly preferred form of the device of the present<br>
invention the cross-section ot the cuff is C shaped, allowingof the cuff with wrapping of the cuff with<br><br><br>
concentrically compress the. length of enclosed aorta and spreads the compression forces<br>
evenly, reducing any wear or fatigue on any one part of the aorta. The balloon cuff is<br>
enclosed within a flexible and non-elastic outer sleeve. The sleeve has an elongated<br>
"tongue" on one arm of the C-shaped cuff and this is passed around the aorta to be<br>
secured by suturing or other means on the outer aspect of the other arm of the C-shaped<br>
cuff. This arrangement stops the balloon inflation force from going outwards.<br>
Furthermore, the preshaped cuff and flexible sleeve are particularly designed to create a<br>
snug fit and low profile on the aorta, to reduce damage to the aorta and surrounding<br>
structures, and to create maximum efficiency of the device.<br>
In a preferred form of the invention, the device is adapted for compression of the<br>
ascending aorta. An upper mid-line sternotomy provides easy -surgical -access to the ~<br>
ascending aorta and has the further advantage of not being very painful for the patient. A<br>
minimum incision is required in this procedure. In this mode of use of the device of the<br>
invention, the compressing means is preferably adapted to squeeze approximately 15-25<br>
ml of blood from the ascending aorta in each compression cycle.<br>
The cuff has a single inlet/outlet port for the fluid to move to inflate/deflate the<br>
balloon. The fluid used is preferably liquid, such as water or saline, as this is<br>
noncompressible and less likely to leak compared to gas. Furthermore, using a liquid<br>
allows a fully implantable device so that the patient can mobilize easily. The port and<br>
connecting tube to the motive means is of sufficient diameter and length to allow rapid<br>
emptying and filling of the cuff without generating too high compression pressures. The<br>
fluid must move within 0.15 sec for effective counterpulsation action. The compressive<br>
force emptying the cuff is the force exerted by the compressed aorta. This approximately<br>
100 mmHg. A tube lumen of approximately 1 to 1.5 cm with a length of 3 to 8 cm allows<br>
17 to 25 ml fluid to pass down a gradient of 100 mmHg in less than 0.15 sec. The<br>
compressive force filling the cuff is generated by the motive means, and this pressure<br>
gradient is approximately the same ie the motive means generates approximately 200<br>
mmHg to allow the fluid to shift into the cuff in less than 0.15 sec.<br>
The port more preferably has a trumpet-shaped or flanged opening into the cuff to spread<br>
the fluid more evenly into the balloon during inflation and to assist more rapid deflation.<br>
There may be a diffuscr mounted within the lumen of the port to reduce the fluid force on<br>
the balloon cuff during inflation.<br>
	Ill--<br><br>
motive means may be a mechanical or an electromechanical device. The motive means<br>
may be an electric motor/cam arrangement. The motive means may include spring<br>
mounted arms driven by a pulse of power to hinged solenoids or the like to drive the<br>
pressure plates towards each other and thereby compress the aorta. An example of a<br>
suitable motive means is an adaptation of the solenoid actuator described in US Patent<br>
No. 4,457,673, the relevant disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. The<br>
motive means may also be based on that used in the Novacor N100 Left Ventricular<br>
Assist System.<br>
The motive means is preferably enclosed in an air-tight housing. The housing<br>
may have a flexible portion that allows for the fluid shift from the motive means - die<br>
flexible portion is presented toward the lung tissue and can thus move back and forth.<br>
More particularly the motive means is fully implanted within the thoracic cavity and a<br>
pressure compliance membrane "interfaces" with the lung surface. Alternatively the<br>
housing may be rigid and when the motive means is activated and the fluid sac<br>
compressed, a small vacuum is created within the housing. This vacuum has the<br>
advantage of increasing the pressure gradient for subsequent emptying of the cuff, to<br>
make emptying more rapid. The level of vacuum could be adjusted by accessing a<br>
transcutaneous gas reservoir linked to the housing. A final alternative is to have a<br>
external gas line from the motive means to allow gas exhaust, eliminating the need for a<br>
compliance chamber, but introducing a percutaneous line that has an increased risk of<br>
infection.<br>
The motive means may be designed so that in the event of failure, it<br>
automatically goes into "off' with the fluid sac filled so that the aorta is not compressed,<br>
thus minimising risk to the patient.<br>
The motive means may include or be associated wiuh means for detecting speed<br>
and completeness of cuff filling and emptying, and of monitoring the fluid pressure<br>
within the connector tube, means for measuring arterial blood pressure or flow. The<br>
motive means may also act to record the ECG, having electrodes positioned on the<br>
housing or as separate wires attached to body tissues.<br>
The means adapted for attachment to the aorta and/or surrounding tissue of the<br>
subject may be any suitable means. For example, the attachment means may be adapted<br>
for suturing and/or gluing the compressing means or motive means to the aorta or the<br>
surrounding tissue within the chest cavity. <br><br>
motive means so as to hold the device in position relative to the aorta. For example, the cuff may<br>
have a plurality of holes through which the cuff may be sutured to the aorta. The cuff may also<br>
have hole or slits to accommodate coronary artery bypass grafts to the ascending aorta. The<br>
motive means will sit within the chest cavity, preferably the right thoracic cavity, between the<br>
mediastinum and the right lung.<br>
The sensor means may be means detecting a selected physiological event<br>
associated with heartbeat. The sensor means may be any means for producing an ECG. Means<br>
for detecting the action potentials of the cardiac muscles, for example electrodes, are well known<br>
to those skilled in the art and will not be described in detail here.<br>
The control means may be any means capable of providing an output to actuate the<br>
motive means in response to signal(s) providing the sensor means.<br>
The control means may provide signals to the motor means to counter synchronise<br>
compression of the aorta with the heart beat to provide counterpulsation, for example, aorta<br>
compression may commence with aortic valve<br>
closure (ventricular diastole), whilst aorta release occurs just prior to contraction/ejection<br>
(ventricular systole).<br>
The power means may be an internal and/or external battery or TET (transcutaneous<br>
electronic transfer).<br>
De-activation of the compressing means may be timed to the R wave of the ECG<br>
and may be adapted for adjustment either manually or automatically. The dicrotic notch<br>
on the arterial pressure wave may provide the signal for actuation of the compressing<br>
means.<br>
In yet a further aspect, the present invention provides a method for improving blood circulation<br>
in a subject, the method including implanting a device in accordance with the invention fully<br>
within the thoracic cavity of a subject, actuating the compressing means periodically in<br>
synchrony with the diastole period to compress the aorta; and alternating the period of actuation<br>
with periods of deactivation of the compressing means thereby allowing the aorta to return to its<br>
uncompressed shape.<br>
The system and device of the invention allow relief/recovery from chronic heart failure<br>
whilst allowing the subject to move around freely without being constrained by a large external<br>
pumping device.<br>

aorta 15, as shown. The device 10 includes an aortic compression means in the form of a<br>
hinged solenoid 2 (see Figs. 2a and 2b) in a housing 12. The solenoid 2 is driven by<br>
pulses of electrical power from a controller/battery 14 to actuate wedge-shaped<br>
compression plates 4 via arms 3. The wedge-shaped plates 4 surround the ascending<br>
portion of the aorta 15. When the plates 4 are actuated they approach each other and that<br>
part of the aorta 15 between the plates 4 is compressed. The' plates 4 have a plurality of<br>
holes 6 that provide means for suturing the plates to the aorta 15 and permitting ingrowth<br>
of tissue therethrough.	'<br>
Figs. 2a and 2b are detailed schematic drawings of the solenoid 2 which show<br>
that it includes two arcuate plates 26 hinged at 8. The plates 26 are shown in the de-<br>
activated (resting) position in Fig. 2a and are shown in the actuated position in Fig. 2b<br>
compressing the aorta 15. The plates 26 are soft form moulded and are actuated by the<br>
hinged solenoid 4 via arms 23.<br>
Fig. 3 to 5b are schematic drawings of second to fourth embodiments of heart<br>
assist devices in accordance with the present invention.<br>
In the second embodiment shown in Fig. 3, the compression plates 34 are<br>
actuated via arms 33, with each of the arms 33 being acted on by a respective rod<br>
solenoid 38 acting through springs 37 between the rod solenoid 38 and the respective arm<br>
33.<br>
In the third embodiment shown in Fig. 4, solenoids 48 act on deformable nitinol<br>
plates 44 connected together at either end 47 to encircle the aorta 15.<br>
In the fourth embodiment shown in Fig. 5a and 5b, wedge-shaped plates 54 are<br>
connected together at one end 57 and each plate is actuated by solenoids 58 acting<br>
through arms 53. As best shown in Fig. 5b, the wedge-shaped plates 54 effectively<br>
conform to the shape of the ascending aorta 15.<br>
Fig. 6 is a block diagram of an embodiment of a cardiac assist system<br>
constructed in accordance with the invention suitable for use with, for example, the<br>
cardiac assist device 10<br><br><br>
signals received from an ECG monitor 102 or systemic arterial blood pressure 103 or the<br>
like. The ECG monitor 102 and/or the control means 1 are preferably implanted but may<br>
be on the body of the subject 99.<br>
In operation, de-activation of the compression plates 4 draws them apart and<br>
effectively unloads the left ventricle by allowing the aorta 15 to return to its usual circular<br>
shape. The expansion of the aorta 15 between the de-activated plates causes a pressure<br>
drop in the aorta 15, facilitating left ventricle ejection (ie unloading of the heart). After<br>
the heart has finished ejecting blood into the aorta 15 and the aortic valve closes, the<br>
plates 4 are activated to move them towards each other and compress the aorta 15 and<br>
thereby squeeze blood out of the volume of the aorta 15 compressed by the compression<br>
plates 4 and augment the diastolic pressure. Coronary artery blood flow to the left<br>
ventricle occurs predominantly in diastole so compression of the aorta 15 also augments<br>
coronary blood flow.<br>
Figs. 7 to 10 show an aortic compression means in the form of a flexible hollow<br>
inflatable cuff 60. The cuff 60 is curved along its length so as to substantially replicate<br>
the curve of the aorta 15 adjacent thereto. The cuff 60 is shown in its de-activatcd<br>
(uninflated) state in Fig. 9a, and has two free ends 61 and 62 which are adapted to overlap<br>
when the cuff 60 is placed around the aorta. As best shown in Fig. 10, the cuff 60 is<br>
retained adjacent the aorta after implantation by suturing the two free ends together at 63.<br>
This also ensures that the cuff 60 is a snug fig around the aorta, when the aorta is in its<br>
usual circular shape.<br>
Further, as best shown in Fig. 9b, a substantially inelastic, flexible sheath 65 is<br>
also preferably placed around the cuff 60. The sheath 65 assists in retaining the cuff 60<br>
adjacent the aorta and inwardly concentrates the compression forces generated by<br>
inflation of the cuff 60, as indicated by arrows 66. The sheath 65 can also have free ends<br>
sutured together to retain it and the cuff 60 adjacent the aorta in addition to, or in place of,<br>
the cuff sutures 63. The sheath 65 is preferably made from DACRON (Trade Mark),<br>
KEVLAR (Trade Mark), TEFLON (Trade Mark), GORE-TEX (Trade Mark),<br>
polyurethane or other flexible inelastic bio-compatible materials. The sheath 65 is <br>
preferably glued, fused or otherwise bonded to the cuff 60.<br>
The cuff 60 also has a single inlet/outlet port 64 for the introduction of fluid to<br>
inflate the cuff 60 and thereby compress the aorta and the removal of fluid foi .he<br>
deflation ol the oil! and relaxing, of the aorta. The fluid is preferably water or an isotonic<br>
solution of salt of other- low-viscoty, non-toxic liquid<br><br>
The fluid is actively pumped into the cuff 60 for inflation into the shape<br>
indicated in phantom in Fig. 9b. The cuff 60 can be actively deflated by suctioning the<br>
fluid from the cuff 60. Alternatively, the cuff 60 can be passively deflated by the blood<br>
pressure of the constricted aorta re-expanding and returning the cuff 60 to the state shown<br>
in Fig. 9a, which eyects the fluid from the cuff 60. It is preferable to actively deflate the<br>
cuff 60 as it gives better presystolic unloading of the heart and counteracts any high<br>
intrathoracic pressures, such as when the subject coughs. In either case, the natural<br>
resilience of the cuff 60 also assists in deflation by biasing the cuff 60 to the shape shown<br>
in Fig 9b.<br>
In another embodiment of heart assist device (not shown), the compression<br>
plates 4 are used to squeeze the cuff 60. This embodiment can be configured to operate in<br>
two ways. Firstly, the plates 4 can provide a larger aortic compression and 'the cuff 60 a<br>
smaller aortic compression, either simultaneously or one after the other. This reduces the<br>
fluid requirements of the cuff 60. Secondly, the cuff 60 can be set at a fixed inflation and<br>
provide a cushion between the plates 4 and the aorta In other embodiments of cuff (not shown), the sheath is integrally formed with<br>
the cuff, preferably by moulding, or in the form of flexible, inelastic fibres embedded in<br>
the cuff.Figs. 11 to 18 are schematic drawings of fifth to tenth embodiments of heart<br>
assist devices in accordance with the present invention that utilise the cuff 60 shown in<br>
Figures 7 to 10.In the fifth embodiment shown in Fig. 11, the cuff 60 is closely coupled to a<br>
fluid-filled air-tight housing 70 that has therein a pump, in the form of rotatable impeller<br>
71 and a pair of valves 72 and 73 for directing the flow of the impeller 71. The housing<br>
also includes an inlet/outlet 76 in fluid communication with the inlet/outlet port 64 of the<br>
cuff 60. A fluid reservoir is also provided in the housing 70 in the form of an internal<br>
portion 74 of the volume of the housing 70, as is a pressure compliance means, in the<br>
form of a substantially flexible portion of 75 of the housing 70.In operation, energisation of the impeller 71 with the valves 72 and 73 in'the '<br>
position shown in Fig. 11 causes fluid to be actively withdrawn from the cuff 60, which<br>
allow the aorla to return to its usual circular shape This fluid is pumped into the internal<br>
portion 74 of the housing 70 and causes the flexible portion 75 to expand to the position<br>
shown in Fig, II When the valves 71 and 73 are in the positions shown in phantom in<br>
Fig' II <br><br>
causes the flexible portion 75 to retract to the position shown in the phantom in Fig. 11.<br>
As with earlier embodiments, the control of the impeller and valves is in response to<br>
signals received from an ECG monitor or systemic arterial blood pressure or the like.<br>
In the sixth embodiment shown in Fig. 12, the device has only a single valve 76.<br>
The aorta is compressed by positioning the valve 76 as shown in Fig. 12 and energising<br>
the impeller 71: When the valve 76 is. moved to the position shown in phantom in Fig. 2<br>
and impeller is de-energised the expanding aorta passively ejects the fluid back into the<br>
portion 74 of the housing 71 and causes the flexible portion 75 to expand to the position<br>
shown in phantom.<br>
In the seventh embodiment shown in Fig. 13, the impeller 71 is driven in one<br>
direction to cause fluid flow in the direction indicated by the arrow to deflate the cuff 60<br>
and expand the flexible portion 75. Reversing the direction of the impeller 71 causes the<br>
flexible portion 75 to retract to the position shown in phantom as fluid is displaced into<br>
the cuff 60 to inflate same. This embodiment requires variable power control to the<br>
motor driving the impeller 71 and a plot of the motor power requirements (Po) relative to<br>
the subject's electro cardiograph reading (ECG) and aortic pressure (Pr.) are shown in<br>
Fig. 14.<br>
In the eighth embodiment shown in Figs. 15 and 16, the housing 71 has a rigid<br>
upper portion 71a and a partially rigid lower portion 71b that includes the flexible portion<br>
75. A motor 77 is mounted in the lower portion 71b that drives a pair of rollers 78, each<br>
positioned on an end of a common shaft 79. The housing portion 71b also has a pair of<br>
upstanding guide posts 80 which are slidably received in corresponding holes in a swash<br>
plate 81. The swash plate 81 has a pair of cam formations 82 on its underside. A fluid-<br>
filled sac 83 is positioned between the swash plate 81 and the housing portion 71a. The<br>
interior of the sac 83 is in fluid communication with the interior of the cuff 60. Power is<br>
supplied to the motor 77 through line 84.<br>
In operation, the motor 77 is energised to rotate the rollers 78, which ride along<br>
the cam formations 82 to drive the swash plate 81 upwards to compress the sac 83 and<br>
eject the fluid therein into the cuff 60 to inflate same. When the rollers 78 have passed <br>
the cams 82 the swash plate 81 returns to its original position and the expanding aorta<br>
passively ejects the fluid back into (lie sac 83. In an alternative embodiment (not shown),<br>
the rollers 78 arc linked to the cam formations 82 to drive tiie swash plate 81 up and down<br>
and thereby actively inflate and actively deflate the cull 60. As a further alternative, (not<br>
shown) a sleppei motoi(s) can be used to drive the swash plate<br><br>
In the ninth embodiment shown in Fig. 17, the housing 71 has a fluid filled sac<br>
83 positioned between a pair of compression plates 84 which are hinged at 85 and driven<br>
by a solenoid 86. Energising the solenoid 86 brings the plates 84 together to squeeze the<br>
sac 83 and force the liquid therein into the cuff 60 to inflate same. De-energising the<br>
solenoid 86 draws the plates 84 apart and the expanding aorta passively ejects the fluid<br>
back into the sac 83. As with earlier embodiments, as the sac 83 inflates the flexible<br>
portion 75 of the housing 71 expands to accommodate the increase in pressure in the<br>
housing 71.<br>
In the tenth embodiment shown in Fig. 18, the heart assist device includes a<br>
liquid pressure adjustment means, in the form of remote reservoir 90, connected between<br>
the cuff 60 and the reservoir 74. Liquid can be added to the heart assist device, via the<br>
remote reservoir 90, to adjust the liquid retained in the (de-activated) cuff 60 and thereby<br>
adjust the pressure therein. This allows the size of the cuff 60 to be adjusted to<br>
compensate fo'r changes in the size of the aorta and/or the amount of aortic compression<br>
to be adjusted to, for example, wean the patient from the heart assist device. When the<br>
reservoir is positioned near the skin, its volume can be adjusted by using a needle to inject<br>
or withdraw liquid. When the reservoir is positioned near the heart assist device, its<br>
volume can be adjusted by adding or withdrawing liquid via a transcutaneous tube. The<br>
pressure in the reservoir 90 can also be sensed and automatically adjusted so as to<br>
maintain a predetermined pressure.<br>
It will be appreciated that the system and device of the present invention, in their<br>
preferred forms, are designed to be simple with no blood contact and a much lower<br>
morbidity risk compared to LVADs. The device and system allows the heart to remain<br>
totally un-instrumented, and the device, by effective counterpulsation in the aorta,<br>
augments the cardiac output up to 15-20%. All natural blood pathways are maintained.<br>
Pulsatile blood flow is also maintained. The patient is able to ambulate and there is no<br>
risk of leg ischaemia.<br>
The present invention provides for long term relief and/or stabilization/ of or<br>
recovery from chronic heart failure. Moreover the present invention may be a suitable<br>
bridging device for transplantation..<br><br><br>
The preferred embodiments of the heart assist device compress the ascending<br>
aorta. This is advantageous as the ascending aorta is less prone to disease than the<br>
descending aorta and, being closer to the heart, provides improved, pumping efficienc;<br>
and thus a smaller heart assist device.<br>
It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that numerous variation<br>
and/or modifications may be made to the invention as shown in the specific embodiment<br>
without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as broadly described. For<br>
example, although the invention has been described in specific reference to compression<br>
of the aorta, the devices, systems and methods of the present invention can equally be<br>
used for the compression of the pulmonary artery to effectively act as a right ventrical<br>
assist device, and the present invention extends to this alternative aspect. The present<br>
