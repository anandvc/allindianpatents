				<td>METHOD OF MAKING MERCAPTOALKYLALKOXYSILANES<br>
[0001] This invention relates to the synthesis of mercapto-functional organosilicon<br>
compounds =Si-(CH2)nSH, more particularly mercaptoalkylalkoxysilanes such as<br>
mercaptopropyltrialkoxy silane (MPTAS), using phase transfer catalysts. The process is<br>
capable of producing high purity mercaptopropyltriethoxysilane (MPTES), for example.<br>
Mercaptoalkylalkoxysilanes made by the process generally have a formula corresponding to<br>
Z-Alk-SH in which Z is one of a group consisting of—SiR12R2, —SiR1R22, and—SiR23;<br>
in which R1 is an alkyl group with 1-12 carbon atoms, a cyclohexyl group, or a phenyl group;<br>
R2 is an alkoxy group containing 1-12 carbon atoms; and Alk represents a divalent<br>
hydrocarbon radical having 1-18 carbon atoms and containing no unsaturation.<br>
[0002] Sulfur containing organosilicon compounds are known to be useful as reactive<br>
coupling agents between rubber and silica fillers, for improving the properties of cured<br>
rubber. They are also known to be useful as adhesion promoters, for adhering rubber<br>
compositions to substrates such as glass and metal. However, many sulfur containing<br>
organosilicon compounds are difficult to make in good yield, because undesirable byproducts<br>
are produced from various side reactions occurring when traditional methods are employed.<br>
[0003] For example, US Patent 3,590,065 (June 29, 1971) relates to a reaction between a<br>
haloalkylalkoxysilane and a thio-urea in the presence of ammonia. However, the necessity of<br>
handling bulky by-products such as guanidine hydrochloride is the major disadvantage<br>
associated with this particular method.<br>
[0004] US Patent 3,849,471 (November 19, 1974) is directed to another method involving<br>
reactions between haloalkylalkoxysilanes and hydrogen sulfide gas in the presence of amines.<br>
However, this reaction is carried out under a high pressure, and also has the disadvantage of<br>
producing a fluffy by-product salt which is difficult to filter from the end product.<br>
[0005] US Patent 3,890,213 (June 17, 1975) relates to yet another method involving<br>
reactions between hydrogen sulfide and alkenylalkoxysilanes. However, the major<br>
disadvantage associated with this method is that the mercaptosilane product itself can become<br>
associated with the alkenylalkoxysilane to form copious amounts of sulfide side products.<br>
[0006] In British Patent 1,102,251 (February 7, 1968), a method is described involving the<br>
reaction of sodium methoxide and hydrogen sulfide to produce sodium hydrosulfide, which is<br>
then further reacted with an haloalkylalkoxysilane. The disadvantage associated with this<br>
particular method however, is that the reaction of sodium methoxide with H2S produces<br>
sodium sulfide as a by-product, which in turn leads to large amounts of polysulfide silanes in<br>
the end product.<br>
[0007] US Patent 5,583,245 ((December 10, 1996) describes a process for making<br>
compounds generally corresponding to the formula Z-Alk-Sn-Alk-Z, in which Z and Alk are<br>
the same as defined above, and in which n is 2-8. According to the process in the '245 patent,<br>
a compound of the formula Z-Alk-X where X is chlorine or bromine, is reacted with an<br>
ammonium hydrosulfide or an alkali metal hydrosulfide, and sulfur, using a phase transfer<br>
catalyst, in an aqueous phase.<br>
[0008] The '245 patent teaches that an additional reactant corresponding to Alk-X may be<br>
present, where an unsymmetrical compound corresponding to Alk-Sn-Alk-Z is desired, in<br>
addition to bis type end products. While the '245 patent does describe a method for preparing<br>
MPTES in a 64.9 % yield by reacting (i) sodium hydrosulfide flakes and (ii)<br>
chloropropyltriethoxysilane (CPTES), in a saturated sodium chloride solution and toluene<br>
solvent, in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst, the yield of MPTES was not optimal.<br>
[0009] While US Patent 5,840,952 ((November 24, 1998) describes a method of making<br>
mercaptopropylalkoxysilanes in good yield, by purging hydrogen sulfide gas in a sodium<br>
sulfide solution in methanol, and then reacting it with chloropropyltrimethoxysilane<br>
(CPTMS) in an anhydrous system, the disadvantage associated with this process is that<br>
sodium sulfide used must first be dehydrated. Another disadvantage of the '952 patent is that<br>
it requires the use of high pressure, i.e., 600 psi/4,140 kilopascal (kPa) hydrogen sulfide gas,<br>
to reduce sodium sulfide to sodium hydrosulfide.<br>
[0010] In a prior copending application assigned to the same assignee as the present<br>
invention, i.e., US Patent Application Serial No. 09/895,719, filed June 29, 2001, and entitled<br>
"Preparation of Sulfur Containing Organosilicon Compounds Using a Buffered Phase<br>
Transfer Catalysis Process", there is described a process based on phase transfer catalysis.<br>
However, this process is directed to the production of bis-type sulfido silanes ?Si-S-Si?,<br>
which generally correspond to the formula (RO)3_mRmSi-Alk-Sn-Alk-SiRm(OR)3-m,<br>
wherein R is a monovalent hydrocarbon group with 1-12 carbon atoms; Alk represents a<br>
divalent hydrocarbon group with 1-18 carbon atoms; m is 0-2; and n is 1-8. According to the<br>
process described in the copending application, (A) a sulfide compound M2Sn or MHS<br>
wherein H is hydrogen, M is ammonium or an alkali metal, and n is as defined above, is<br>
reacted with (B) a silane compound corresponding to (RO)3-mRmSi-Alk-X, wherein X is Cl,<br>
Br or I, m is the same as defined above, and (C) sulfur, in the presence of a phase transfer<br>
catalyst, in an aqueous phase containing a buffering agent. However, no method is described<br>
in the copending application for making mercapto-functional organosilicon compounds, i.e.,<br>
compounds containing the group =Si-(CH2)nSH.<br>
[0011] The copending application, however, results in sulfidosilanes instead of<br>
mercaptosilanes. This is because of the presence of elemental sulfur in the copending<br>
application, and the use of different buffering agents in the copending application than the<br>
buffering agents (i.e., pH adjusting agents) used in the present application. In addition, pH is<br>
a controlling factor in these applications as to what is being prepared. The difference is based<br>
on (i) establishment of the equilibrium<br><br>
and (iii) the fact that the disulfide anion is undetectable at a pH of about 9 or less.<br>
[0012] Another way to view the difference is that when it is desired to make<br>
mercaptosilanes, rather than sulfidosilanes, the alkalinity of the reaction mixture must remain<br>
at a pH in the range of 4 to 9. Higher concentrations of alkalinity lead to disulfide anion<br>
formation from the mercaptide anion already present, without adding elemental sulfur. When<br>
it is desired to make the disulfide, it is necessary for the system to remain high in alkalinity,<br>
to inhibit any equilibrium leading to NaHS formation. As these reactants naturally react and<br>
form a neutral NaCl, the alkalinity of the brine will lessen over time, and can become low<br>
enough so that SH will form.<br>
[0013] So the present application differs from the copending application in that (i) different<br>
pH adjusting agents are employed, (ii) the pH is different, i.e., a pH of 4 to 9, preferably a pH<br>
of 5-8, and more preferably a pH of 5 to less than 7, instead of a pH of 7-14, and (iii) the<br>
order of addition of the reactants is not the same. The result is that at the lower pH of 4 to less<br>
than 7, any sulfide present is converted to mercaptan in the aqueous phase.<br>
[0014] The process of the present invention further differs from processes described above,<br>
in that it is capable of providing high yields of mercaptosilanes under mild conditions,<br>
without the use of solvents, toxic gas, and strictly anhydrous conditions. In addition, it is<br>
more economical, environment friendly, and capable of utilizing relatively inexpensive<br>
starting materials. When there is any byproduct present, it is simply an alkali metal salt,<br>
which can be easily removed by dissolution during the water and phase separation sequence<br>
of the process.<br>
[0015] Other advantages provided by the present invention over the prior art include the<br>
benefit that the mercaptoalkylalkoxy silane yield is significantly increased when<br>
chloroalkylalkoxysilanes are reacted with an aqueous solution of sodium hydrosulfide in the<br>
presence of (i) a phase transfer catalyst and (ii) gases which form an acidic solution in water<br>
to control the pH of the aqueous phase, at a pressure of 10-200 psi/69-1,380 kPa, preferably<br>
25-100 psi/173-690 kPa. Some particularly suitable gases are hydrogen sulfide, carbon<br>
dioxide, and sulfur dioxide. The reaction can be carried out without requiring use of a<br>
solvent, and no extra salt is needed to saturate the aqueous phase to prevent hydrolysis of any<br>
alkoxy groups present on silicon atoms in the molecule.<br>
[0016] Most significantly, however, the order of addition of the reactants plays an<br>
important role in the product yield and quality. Thus, it was surprising to discover that the<br>
mercaptoalkylalkoxysilane yield can be increased when the NaHS solution is added to a<br>
mixture of the haloalkylalkoxysilane and the anhydrous phase transfer catalyst at the reaction<br>
temperature. In this regard, anhydrous pH adjusting salts may be required to be added to the<br>
organic reaction mixture before the NaHS addition, to control any potential side reactions. In<br>
those instances where it is desired to carry out the reaction under pressure conditions, the<br>
reactor is pressurized with H2S, CO2, and/or SO2, before addition of the NaHS to the<br>
haloalkylalkoxysilane/catalyst mixture. The anhydrous salt of a mineral acid and the phase<br>
transfer catalyst can then be mixed with the haloalkylalkoxysilane, before adding the sodium<br>
hydrosulfide. This feature will tend to minimize any hydrolysis of alkoxy groups on silicon.<br>
[0017] Lastly, the presence of side products of species such as<br>
3,3'bis(triethoxysilylpropyl)monosulfide (TESPM) and 3,3'bis(triethoxysilylpropyl)disulfide<br>
(TESPD), are significantly reduced when mineral acids and their salts are used in the process.<br>
Thus, the acids and the pH adjusting agents having pH values of less than seven, react with<br>
disodium sulfide impurities in the aqueous solution of sodium hydrosulfide, and produce<br>
sodium hydrosulfide and hydrogen sulfide gas. The maintenance of a positive pressure of<br>
H2S in the existing headspace will prevent the formation of the sulfide species, by shifting<br>
the equilibrium between NaHS and sodium sulfide (Na2S), toward NaHS in the aqueous<br>
phase.<br>
[0018] This invention is directed to a process for making high purity<br>
mercaptoalkylalkoxysilanes using a phase transfer catalyst, by forming a mixture of (i) an<br>
haloalkylalkoxysilane and (ii) a phase transfer catalyst, prior to the addition of (iii) a sulfide<br>
compound such as sodium hydrosulfide. The reaction will occur without requiring that there<br>
be present in the haloalkylalkoxysilane phase, a concentrated sodium chloride salt solution<br>
with the sodium hydrosulfide, or an organic solvent. The formation of byproducts can also be<br>
reduced by the addition of certain pH adjusting agents having a pH of less than seven to the<br>
mixture containing the haloalkylalkoxysilane and the phase transfer catalyst. In particular, the<br>
process is directed to the reaction of an aqueous solution of sodium hydrosulfide with CPTES<br>
in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst, and a pH adjusting agent of a pH of 4 to 9,<br>
preferably a pH of 5-8, and more preferably a pH of 5 to less than 7. Thus, it was surprisingly<br>
discovered that both the order of addition of the reactants, and the addition of certain pH<br>
adjusting agents in the reaction mixture, significantly increased the yield of MPTES by<br>
minimizing formation of undesirable end products such as TESPM and TESPD.<br>
[0019] As an additional feature, the invention is directed to the use of certain pH adjusting<br>
agents which are acidic in their nature in an aqueous solution, such as SO2 (sulfur dioxide),<br>
CO2 (carbon dioxide), H2S (hydrogen sulfide), H3PO4 (phosphoric acid), H3BO3 (boric<br>
acid), and HCl (hydrochloric acid). These materials improve the yield by minimizing the<br>
production of any undesirable byproduct such as TESPM and TESPD.<br>
[0020] In a first embodiment of the process for making the mercaptoalkylalkoxysilanes, a<br>
pH adjusting agent and a sulfide containing compound are mixed in an aqueous phase to<br>
provide a pH of 4-9, a phase transfer catalyst is added to the aqueous phase, a<br>
haloalkylalkoxysilane is then added to the aqueous phase to form a reaction mixture<br>
containing mercaptoalkylalkoxysilanes and water soluble byproducts, and the desired<br>
mercaptoalklyalkoxysilanes are separated from the water soluble byproducts.<br>
[0021] In an alternate embodiment, the haloalkylalkoxysilane, the phase transfer catalyst,<br>
and an anhydrous pH adjusting agent such as sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, hydrogen<br>
sulfide, phosphoric acid, boric acid, and hydrochloric acid, and anhydrous salts thereof, are<br>
mixed, then an aqueous solution of a sulfide containing compound is added to form a reaction<br>
mixture containing mercaptoalkylalkoxysilanes and water soluble byproducts, and desired<br>
mercaptoalklyalkoxysilanes are separated from water soluble byproducts.<br>
[0022] Following is a list of acronyms used in this application:<br>
CPTES - Chloropropyltriethoxysilane<br>
CPTMS - Chloropropyltrimethoxysilane<br>
MPT AS - Mercaptopropyltrialkoxysilane<br>
MPTES - Mercaptopropyltriethoxysilane<br>
TBAB - Tetrabutylammonium Bromide<br>
TBAC - Tetrabutylammonium Chloride<br>
TESPD - 3,3'bis(triethoxysilylpropyl)disulfide<br>
TESPM - 3,3'bis(triethoxysilylpropyl)monosulfide<br>
[0023] These and other features of the invention will become apparent from a consideration<br>
of the following detailed description.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0024] The synthesis of mercapto-functional alkoxysilanes is carried out via a reaction<br>
using a phase transfer catalysis process in an aqueous/organic medium. The use of small<br>
amounts of gases such as H2S, CO2, and SO2, as well as the use of the other pH adjusting<br>
agents of the invention which are all acidic in nature in the aqueous phase, during the<br>
reaction, minimizes the production of undesirable end products such as TESPM and TESPD.<br>
Therefore, the yield of a mercaptopropyltrialkoxysilane can be significantly increased to more<br>
than 90 percent. As noted, it was also surprisingly discovered that a positive pressure of H2S<br>
or CO2 during the reaction of (i) chloropropyltriethoxysilane with (ii) a sodium hydrosulfide<br>
solution and (iii) tetrabutylammonium bromide catalyst (TBAB) minimized TESPM and<br>
TESPD to less than 1.0 weight percent, compared to about 10 weight percent when no<br>
pressure was maintained.<br>
[0025] In this regard, it is believed that the H2S or CO2 pressure causes a reduction in the<br>
pH of the aqueous phase either by the dissolution of H2S, or there occurs an intermediate<br>
reaction of CO2 with H2O to form carbonic acid. In any event, at a reduced pH, the di-<br>
sodium sulfide impurities are converted to sodium hydrosulfide, and minimize TESPM<br>
formation. Thus, when a sodium hydrosulfide aqueous solution was added to a heated reactor<br>
pressurized with H2S gas and containing TBAB and CPTES, the organic phase after filtration<br>
included more than 90 weight percent of desired end product MPTES, and less than one<br>
weight percent of undesired species TESPM and TESPD.<br>
[0026] Accordingly, the first sequence of steps of the process involves mixing a phase<br>
transfer catalyst with an haloalkylalkoxysilane. Phase transfer catalysts suitable for use<br>
according to the invention are quaternary onium cations. Some representative examples of<br>
quaternary onium salts yielding quaternary ammonium cations that can be used as phase<br>
transfer catalysts are described in US 5,405,985 (April 11, 1995), among which are<br>
tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB), tetrabutylammonium chloride (TBAC),<br>
tetrabutylphosphonium bromide, tetrabutylphosphonium chloride, tetraphenylarsonium<br>
bromide, and tetraphenylarsonium chloride. The '985 patent is considered as being<br>
incorporated herein by reference. The preferred quaternary onium salts according to this<br>
invention are TBAB and TBAC, most preferably TBAB. These materials are available<br>
commercially from chemical suppliers such as Sigma-Aldrich, Milwaukee, Wisconsin. While<br>
the amount of phase transfer catalyst used in the process can vary, it is preferably used in an<br>
amount of 0.1-10 weight percent, most preferably 0.5-2 weight percent, based on the amount<br>
of haloalkylalkoxysilane being used in the process.<br>
[0027] Haloalkylalkoxysilanes for purposes of this invention are those organosilicon<br>
compounds having a structure generally corresponding to the formula (RO)3_mRmSi-Alk-X,<br>
wherein each R is an independently selected hydrocarbon group containing 1-12 carbon<br>
atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, isobutyl, cyclohexyl, or phenyl. Preferably, R is a<br>
methyl or ethyl group, m can be 0, 1, or 2, but preferably m is zero. Alk represents a divalent<br>
hydrocarbon group containing 1-18 carbon atoms, preferably 2-4 carbon atoms, such as<br>
ethylene, propylene, butylene, or isobutylene. Preferably, Alk is a propylene group. X is one<br>
of the halogen atoms, i.e., fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine, preferably chlorine. Some<br>
representative examples of haloalkylalkoxysilanes suitable for use in this invention include<br>
chloropropyltriethoxysilane, chloropropyltrimethoxysilane, chloroethyltriethoxysilane,<br>
chlorobutyltriethoxysilane, chloroisobutylmethyldiethoxy silane,<br>
chloroisobutylmethyldimethoxysilane, and chloropropyldimethylethoxysilane. The<br>
haloalkylalkoxysilane compound most preferred is chloropropyltriethoxysilane.<br>
[0028] The second sequential step of the process is addition of a sulfide compound. The<br>
sulfide compound is a composition having a structure corresponding to the formula M2Sn or<br>
MHS, or mixtures thereof, wherein M represents an alkali metal or ammonium group, and H<br>
is hydrogen. While the alkali metal can be potassium, sodium, rubidium, or cesium, sodium is<br>
preferred. Representative of some preferred compositions of the type MHS include<br>
compositions such as NaHS, KHS, and NH4HS, with NaHS being most preferred. The NaHS<br>
composition can be used in the form of NaHS flakes containing 71.5-74.5 weight percent<br>
NaHS, or an NaHS liquor containing 45-60 weight percent NaHS. Such materials are<br>
available commercially from PPG Industries, Inc., Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Optionally,<br>
compositions of the type M2Sn can be used, when it is desired to avoid the necessity of<br>
dissolving solid or flake forms. Suitable compositions of this type include Na2S, K2S, Cs2S,<br>
(NH4)2S, Na2S2, Na2S3, Na2S4, Na2S6, K2S2 K2S3? K2S4, K2S6, and (NH4)2S2. A<br>
particularly preferred sulfide composition is a solution containing 25-72 weight percent of<br>
NaHS, preferably 45-60 weight percent NaHS, also available from PPG Industries, Inc.,<br>
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.<br>
[0029] If desired, sulfur (S) can be added as an optional ingredient. A suitable sulfur is<br>
elemental sulfur in the form of an 100 mesh refined sulfur powder available from Sigma-<br>
Aldrich, Milwaukee, Wisconsin. While the amount of sulfur and sulfide compound can vary,<br>
it can be present in a molar ratio corresponding to S/M2Sn or S/MHS of 0 to 2.0, preferably<br>
zero.<br>
[0030] In the preferred embodiment, the phase transfer catalyst and haloalkylalkoxysilane<br>
are combined with a pH adjusting agent which is only slightly acidic in nature or one that is<br>
diluted to such an extent as to be only slightly acidic. The pH adjusting agent can be SO2<br>
(sulfur dioxide), CO2 (carbon dioxide), H2S (hydrogen sulfide), H3PO4 (phosphoric acid),<br>
H3BO3 (boric acid), or HCl (hydrochloric acid). While the amount of pH adjusting agent<br>
added to the aqueous phase can vary, it is generally present in a molar amount of 0.01 to 1.0<br>
mole per mole of M2Sn or MHS being used in the process, preferably 0.01 to 0.3 mole per<br>
mole of M2Sn or MHS being used in the process.<br>
[0031] The process is carried out in an aqueous/organic phase containing the<br>
haloalkylalkoxysilane, phase transfer catalyst, pH adjusting agent, and sulfide compound.<br>
While the amount of water used to create the aqueous phase can vary, it is preferably based<br>
on the amount of haloalkylalkoxysilane being used in the process. The water can be added<br>
directly, or it can be present indirectly, as the water present in small amounts in starting<br>
materials. In any case, the total amount of water for purposes of the invention should include<br>
all water added directly or indirectly. Accordingly, the total amount of water used to create<br>
the aqueous phase is 1-100 weight percent of the amount of haloalkylalkoxysilane being used<br>
in the process, preferably 2.5-70 weight percent, most preferably 20-40 weight percent.<br>
[0032] Although not being willing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that<br>
that the addition of only certain pH adjusting agents, i.e., the pH adjusting agents noted<br>
above, to the aqueous phase during the process, controls the pH of the reaction medium so as<br>
to directly affect product formation and minimizes any potential of undesired side reactions.<br>
Thus, the pH is controlled by addition of such pH adjusting agents at rates and concentrations<br>
so as to maintain the pH during the reaction in the range of 4 to 9, preferably in the range of<br>
5-8, and more preferably in the range of 5 to less than 7. The haloalkylalkoxysilane<br>
compound is added to the aqueous phase at such a rate so as to control the exothermic<br>
reaction, and at the same time maintain a temperature in the range of 40-110 °C. Preferably<br>
the reaction temperature is maintained at 60-95 °C. The progress of the reaction can be<br>
monitored by determining the consumption of the haloalkylalkoxysilane. The amount of<br>
catalyst being used as well as the reaction temperature will affect the reaction time necessary<br>
for its completion.<br>
[0033] At the end of the reaction, a product mixture is produced containing an organic<br>
phase, an aqueous phase, and possibly some precipitated solid materials that includes salts<br>
formed during the reaction. The organic phase contains the mercaptoalkylalkoxysilane, and<br>
separation of the mercaptoalkylalkoxysilane from the product mixture can be obtained simply<br>
by phase separation of the organic phase from the aqueous phase, or if precipitated salts are<br>
formed during the reaction, the salts can be separated first by filtering or decanting prior to<br>
the phase separation. Water or a dilute acidic solution can be added to the product mixture<br>
prior to separation, as the addition of water or a dilute acidic solution tends to enhance phase<br>
separation by dissolving precipitated salts.<br>
[0034] The amount of water or dilute acidic solution added during this step can vary from<br>
10-50 weight percent based on the weight of the haloalkylalkoxysilane, preferably 20-40<br>
weight percent, and most preferably 25-35 weight percent. When a dilute acidic solution is<br>
used, it can contain HCl, HNO3, or H2SO4, for example, having normal (N) concentrations<br>
of 0.000001-5, preferably 0.01-1. The dilute acidic solution can also be prepared by adding a<br>
chlorosilane to water, i.e., =Si-Cl + H-OH ? ?Si-OH + HCl.<br>
[0035] Following addition of water or a dilute acidic solution to the product mixture, the<br>
mercaptoalkylalkoxysilane can be isolated from the product mixture by phase separating the<br>
organic phase from the aqueous phase. The organic phase containing the<br>
mercaptoalkylalkoxysilane can also be subjected to a drying step. One example of drying is<br>
to treat the organic phase under vacuum to remove any volatile organic materials present,<br>
along with the residual water. The drying can be to simply heat the organic phase to a<br>
temperature of 20-160 °C under a reduced pressure of 5-35 mm Hg (0.67 to 4.65 kPa),<br>
preferably 90-120 °C at 5-25 mm Hg (0.67 to 3.33 kPa). Alternatively, drying of the organic<br>
phase can be obtained using a thin film stripper to remove volatile organic materials as well<br>
as residual water in the organic phase.<br>
[0036] Yet another drying technique is to contact the organic phase containing the<br>
mercaptoalkylalkoxysilane with a desiccant. The desiccant can be any solid material known<br>
to be capable of removing trace quantities of water from organic phases. Representative<br>
desiccants are typically ionic hygroscopic compositions such as sodium sulfate, magnesium<br>
sulfate, as well as the silicate based compositions such as zeolites, silica, and<br>
alumina/silicates. Preferred desiccants are sodium sulfate or magnesium sulfate, and sodium<br>
sulfate is most preferred.<br>
[0037] The dried organic phase can then be subjected to additional steps to further improve<br>
its final purity and appearance. Thus, the organic phase containing the<br>
mercaptoalkylalkoxysilane can be heated under vacuum to strip low boiling components such<br>
as ethanol, water, tributylamine, and dissolved H2S gas, For example, the organic phase,<br>
when heated to 30-100 °C at 10-200 mm Hg/1.3-27 kPa vacuum, provides a clear product<br>
which has a better shelf life. The organic phase, after stripping the low boiling components<br>
can also be distilled under high vacuum, i.e., 1-20 mm Hg/0.133-2.7 kPa, to provide highly<br>
pure mercaptoalkylalkoxysilanes. As a result, the long-term storage stability of the<br>
mercaptoalkylalkoxysilane is enhanced, i.e., the composition does not change with time or<br>
result in products containing undesirable solid precipitates.<br>
[0038] The following examples are set forth to illustrate the invention in more detail. In<br>
particular, they teach those skilled in the art how to obtain the primary benefits of the present<br>
invention, i.e., increase the yield of MPTES and reduce side product species such as TESPM<br>
and TESPD.<br>
[0039] The purpose of this example is to show no reduction in TESPM formation when<br>
none of the pH adjusting agents of the invention are employed. Thus, in a three neck round<br>
bottom flask equipped with an addition funnel, condenser, stirrer and thermometer, was<br>
added with 100 g (1.26 moles) of NaHS flakes containing 61.7 percent by weight NaHS and<br>
6.07 weight percent Na2S, and 75.62 g of deionized (DI) water. The mixture was heated to 70<br>
°C and mixed to make a bright yellow solution of NaHS. Then, 9.0 g (0.0094 mole)<br>
tetrabutylammonium bromide solution containing 25 weight percent active was added and<br>
mixed. The color of the mixture changed to dark brown, and an oily layer of catalyst<br>
intermediate formed at the interface. Then 317.6 g (1.32 mole) chloropropyltriethoxysilane<br>
was added slowly in 8 minutes while mixing at 500 rpm. The reaction temperature increased<br>
to 82 °C due to an exotherm. The reaction was carried out for 3 hours at 80 °C, and 139.6 g<br>
of deionized water was added after cooling the mixture to 50 °C to dissolve the sodium<br>
chloride salt byproduct. After conducting a phase separation, 287.7 g of an organic phase was<br>
collected. It contained 8.4 weight percent of unreacted CPTES, 61.7 weight percent of<br>
mercaptopropyltriethoxysilane, 9.6 weight percent of TESPM, and 17.82 weight percent of<br>
TESPD, as determined by Gas Chromatograhy (GC) analysis.<br>
[0040] This example is the reverse of Example 1, and shows that the product gelled. Thus,<br>
the order of addition in Example 1 was reversed, and a solution of sodium hydrosulfide flake<br>
was prepared by adding 76.2 g of water to 100.11 g of sodium hydrosulfide flakes. The<br>
solution was added slowly via an addition funnel to a reaction mixture containing 317.6 g of<br>
chloropropyltriethoxysilane and 3.1 g of solid tetrabutylammonium bromide at 67 °C. The<br>
reaction mixture gelled within 5 minutes of the NaHS addition.<br>
[0041] The purpose of this example is to show that while the addition of sulfur reduced the<br>
formation of TESPM, the formation of TESPD increased. Thus, in a similar reaction to the<br>
one in Example 1, the ratio of sulfur to NaHS was increased to 0.05 to convert the TESPM<br>
into TESPD. NaHS flakes (146.3 g., 1.83 mole), sulfur (2.92 g, 0.092 mole), and 100 g DI<br>
water, were mixed in a glass-jacketed reactor and heated to 70 °C. TBAB solution (14.4 g,<br>
0.011 mole) was added and mixed. Instantly, an oily omega phase was formed at the surface.<br>
CPTES (400 g, 1.66 mole) was added at a rate of about 30 ml/min. The reaction temperature<br>
increased to 94 °C due to the exotherm, and some gel was observed in the organic phase.<br>
380.1 g (95 percent by weight of CPTES) organic phase was collected after a three hour<br>
reaction. The gas chromatography analysis showed 1.5 percent CPTES, 66.7 percent MPTES,<br>
3.37 percent TESPM, and 27.9 percent TESPD.<br>
[0042] This example is the same as Example 3 except that a salt was added so that no<br>
gelation would occur in the organic phase. However, while the formation of TESPM was<br>
reduced, the formation of TESPD increased. Accordingly, an excess amount of NaHS flakes<br>
were used, and NaCl salt was added to saturate the aqueous phase before the addition of<br>
CPTES. The sulfur/NaHS ratio was 0.05. The catalyst solution was also added after the<br>
CPTES addition was completed. Thus, NaHS flakes (100 g., 1.248 mole), NaCl 87.7 g, sulfur<br>
(2.0 g, 0.063 mole), and 161.5 g of water, were mixed and heated to 60 °C. CPTES (161.5 g.,<br>
0.671 mole) was added slowly and mixed at 300 rpm. A 25 weight percent solution of TBAB<br>
catalyst was added to the reaction mixture at 65 °C. A slight exotherm was observed, and the<br>
reaction was completed in about 5 hours. The GC analysis of the organic phase showed that it<br>
contained 0.35 weight percent CPTES, 62.2 weight percent MPTES, 1.1 weight percent<br>
TESPM, and 34.1 weight percent TESPD. The product was stable. The MPTES yield was<br>
less due to side reactions when sodium hydrosulfide flakes were used.<br>
[0043] This example shows the benefits obtained by using a solution of NaHS instead of<br>
NaHS flakes. In this example, the yield of MPTES was increased while the amount of the<br>
TESPM and TESPD byproducts decreased, by using the NaHS solution. Thus, NaHS flakes<br>
were replaced with a solution containing 45 weight percent of NaHS. No additional water<br>
was used in the aqueous phase as the NaHS solution contained water. Thus, a solution<br>
containing 45 weight percent NaHS (143 g., 1.15 mole) and 50 weight percent of a TBAB<br>
solution (99.6 g, 0.015 mole) were added into a glass reactor, mixed, and heated to 70 °C.<br>
CPTES (240.8 g., 1.0 mole) was slowly added to maintain the reaction temperature below 80<br>
°C. After 5 hours, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, and water was added<br>
to dissolve the NaCl salt in the aqueous phase. 229 g. of a light yellow organic phase was<br>
collected (95 weight percent based on CPTES), and analyzed. The GC analysis showed that it<br>
contained 1.6 weight percent CPTES, 84 weight percent MPTES, 6.9 weight percent TESPM,<br>
and 1.4 weight percent TESPD. No gel was found in the product. Color in the product was<br>
removed by treating it with 1-2 weight percent activated carbon black and clay.<br>
[0044] The NaHS/CPTES ratio in this example was changed from 1.15 to 1.30. All other<br>
conditions were similar to Example 5. An increase in rate of reaction was observed with an<br>
increase in NaHS concentration in the reaction mixture. No significant change was observed<br>
in the product composition. The reaction was completed in 3 hours. The GC analysis results<br>
showed 0.8 weight percent CPTES, 82.3 weight percent MPTES, 6.6 weight percent TESPM,<br>
and 0.8 weight percent TESPD.<br>
[0045] Example 6 was repeated, except the order of addition of the reactants was reversed.<br>
Thus, CPTES (240.8 g., 1.0 mole) and solid TBAB (4.82 g., 0.015 mole) were added into a<br>
glass reactor, mixed, and heated to 70 °C. A solution containing 45 weight percent NaHS<br>
(160.4 g., 1.30 mole) was added using an addition funnel in about 20 minutes. A slight<br>
exotherm was observed during the initial addition of NaHS. The reaction was stopped after 4<br>
hours, and the byproduct NaCl was dissolved in water. The organic phase recovered after the<br>
phase separation was 225.5 g. (93.6 weight percent based on CPTES). The product<br>
composition by GC analysis showed that it contained 0.83 weight percent CPTES, 84.2<br>
weight percent MPTES, 6.79 weight percent TESPM, and 0.7 weight percent TESPD. There<br>
was a slight improvement in MPTES yield by changing the order of addition of the sodium<br>
hydrosulfide. The GC analysis also showed a lower content of hydrolyzed oligomers than the<br>
GC analysis in Example 6.<br>
[0046] The purpose of this example is to further minimize the TESPM formation and to<br>
increase the MPTES yield. Accordingly, an HCl solution was added dropwise to an NaHS<br>
solution during its reaction with CPTES at atmospheric pressure. Hydrogen sulfide gas<br>
formed in the reaction was neutralized in a caustic scrubber. 150.1 g (1.2 mole) of a 45<br>
percent by weight NaHS solution, and 9.63 g (0.015 mole) of a 50 percent by weight TBAB<br>
catalyst solution, was added to the reactor, mixed, and heated to 65 °C. 100 g (0.15 mole) of a<br>
1.3 molar HCl solution, and 240.0 g (1.0 mole) of CPTES, were added simultaneously from<br>
two addition funnels, at a rate such that the addition of CPTES was completed in 15 minutes,<br>
and the addition of HCl was complete in about an hour. The reaction was continued at 70 °C<br>
for 5 hours. GC data showed 11.4 weight percent of unreacted CPTES remaining, and<br>
therefore 12.48 g (0.1002 mole) of an NaHS solution was again added and reacted for 5<br>
hours. The organic phase was separated after cooling and filtered through a 0.45 micron filter<br>
disc. Gas chromatographic (GC) analysis of the organic phase showed that the product<br>
contained 2.6 weight percent of CPTES, 91.0 weight percent of MPTES, 1.99 weight percent<br>
of TESPM, and 2.34 weight percent of TESPD.<br>
[0047] A 50 percent by weight solution of NaHSC4 was added to an NaHS solution during<br>
its reaction with CPTES. 325 g (2.69 mole) of an NaHS solution, and 8.2 g (0.0124 mole) of<br>
a TBAB solution, were added to a glass reactor, mixed, and heated to 75 °C. The addition<br>
dropwise of NaHSO4 solution was initiated just prior to the addition of CPTES. 497.8 g<br>
(2.07 mole) of CPTES was added to the reaction mixture in 8 minutes. The addition of the<br>
NaHSO4 solution was complete in 30 minutes. The organic phase was separated after a 5<br>
hour reaction and analyzed by GC. The product contained 2.0 percent by weight of CPTES,<br>
87.6 percent by weight of MPTES, 2.7 percent by weight of TESPM, and 0.7 percent by<br>
weight of TESPD. The product was distilled under vacuum to provide a 95.4 percent pure<br>
MPTES at a yield of about 84 percent, based on the amount of CPTES employed.<br>
[0048] Boric acid was used in this example to lower the pH of the reaction mixture. The<br>
order of addition of CPTES and NaHS as compared to Example 10 was also reversed to<br>
minimize any potential formation of a gel. Thus, 206.3 g (0.86 mole) of CPTES, 4.13 g<br>
(0.013 mole) of solid TBAB, and 51.4 g (0.83 mole) of H3BO3, were mixed in ajacketed<br>
glass reactor and heated to 65 °C. 100.0 g (0.83 mole) of an NaHS solution was slowly<br>
added with a dropping funnel over a time interval of 30 minutes. Froth and foaming were<br>
observed due to the reaction of NaHS and boric acid. Additional NaHS solution and TBAB<br>
catalyst were added after reaction with CPTES for 3-4 hours. After a total reaction time of 6<br>
hours, the reaction mixture was cooled, filtered, and phase separated. The product<br>
composition by GC analysis was determined to be 1.2 percent by weight of CPTES, 89.3<br>
percent by weight of MPTES, 2.8 percent by weight of TESPM, and 0.2 percent by weight of<br>
TESPD.<br>
[0049] Sodium di-hydrogen phosphate monohydrate was used as a pH adjusting agent in<br>
this example to reduce the formation of TESPM in the product. Thus, 27.6 g (0.2 mole) of<br>
NaH2PO4.H2O was added to a reactor. 157.4 g (1.30 mole) of a 45 percent by weight<br>
solution of NaHS was slowly added to avoid any violent reaction between NaHS and<br>
dihydrogen phosphate. H2S gas was evolved from the reaction, and was trapped in a caustic<br>
scrubber. 9.63 g (0.015 mole) of a TBAB solution was added, and mixed for 5 minutes. A<br>
very dark green omega phase of a catalyst intermediate formed instantly. The reaction<br>
mixture was slowly heated to 70 °C, and 240.8 g (1.0 mole) of CPTES was added over 15<br>
minutes. The reaction was continued for 4 hours at 70 °C. Upon its cooling and phase<br>
separation, a 227.6 gram organic phase was obtained. The organic phase yield was 94.5<br>
percent, based on the amount of CPTES used in the reaction. GC results of the organic phase<br>
showed 2.8 percent of CPTES, 89.6 percent of MPTES, 4.5 percent of TESPM, and 1.15<br>
percent of TESPD.<br>
[0050] In this example, sodium acetate trihydrate was mixed with an NaHS solution to<br>
reduce the pH of the aqueous phase and to minimize the formation of TESPM. Thus,<br>
equimolar amounts of sodium acetate and NaHS were added to a reactor and mixed. No<br>
change in the pH was observed. The reaction was carried out using a slight molar excess of<br>
CPTES, and in the presence of the TBAB catalyst, as described above in Examples 8-11. GC<br>
results of the final product showed no effect on TESPM reduction, however. The product<br>
contained 83.1 percent by weight of MPTES and 7.38 percent by weight of TESPM.<br>
[0051] In the following examples, a series of experiments were performed using H2S as pH<br>
adjusting agent, at different H2S pressure, to control the pH of reaction mixture and improve<br>
the yield of MPTES.<br>
[0052] A pressure reactor containing NaHS solution was pressurized with H2S gas to 10 psi<br>
at room temperature before reacting it with CPTES in presence of a TBAB catalyst. The H2S<br>
gas in water had a pH of 4.2, and reacted with Na2S byproducts in the aqueous phase to<br>
provide NaHS. It also prevented Na2S formation by maintaining the pH below 9. The<br>
positive pressure of H2S during the reaction also minimized hydrolysis of any alkoxy groups<br>
and polymer formation<br>
[0053] Thus, 139.4 g (1.15 mole) of NaHS solution was added to the reactor and the reactor<br>
was sealed. The reactor was then charged with 10 psi/69 kPa H2S and the contents were<br>
mixed for 5 minutes. A pressure drop was initially observed due to the H2S solubility in<br>
water and its reaction with Na2S. The NaHS was heated to 70 °C, and 9.6 g (0.015 mole) of<br>
a 50 weight percent solution of TBAB and 240.8 g (1.0 mole) of CPTES were fed<br>
consecutively into the reactor using a pressure syringe. The reaction was continued for 3.5<br>
hours at 80 °C before being cooled. Deionized water was added to the reaction mixture to<br>
dissolve any NaCl salt byproduct, and the organic phase was recovered by phase separation.<br>
The GC composition consisted of 1.8 weight percent of CPTES, 87.5 weight percent of<br>
MPTES, 4.6 weight percent of TESPM, and 1.5 weight percent of TESPD. The yield was 90<br>
percent.<br>
[0054] Except for the 50 psi/345 kPa H2S pressure, all other conditions were the same as<br>
Example 13. The reaction was completed in 5 hours. The product composition was 0.4<br>
weight percent of CPTES, 93.0 weight percent of MPTES, 1.9 weight percent of TESPM,<br>
and 0.08 weight percent of TESPD. The product yield was 93.3 percent.<br>
[0055] Except for the 100 psi/690 kPa H2S pressure, all other conditions were the same as<br>
Examples 13 and 14. The product composition after a 5 hour reaction was 0.5 weight percent<br>
of CPTES, 89.8 weight percent of MPTES, 0.8 weight percent of TESPM, and 0.3 weight<br>
percent of TESPD. The yield was 95.3 percent. It can be seen that the yield of MPTES was<br>
improved by suppressing any byproduct formation through control of the pH by the H2S gas.<br>
[0056] This example is the same as Example 14 except that the order of addition of the<br>
reactants is reversed. Also, a solid TBAB catalyst was used to avoid the hydrolysis of<br>
CPTES. Thus, 240.8 g (1.0 mole) of CPTES and 4.8 g (0.015 mole) of solid TBAB catalyst<br>
were loaded into a pressure reactor and the reactor was sealed. The reactor was pressurized<br>
with H2S until the pressure stabilized at 50 psi/345 kPa. The H2S valve was closed, and the<br>
reaction mixture was heated to 70 °C while mixing the contents at 500 rpm. 139.2 g (1.15<br>
mole) of an NaHS solution was then slowly added to the reactor at a rate of about 10 ml/min<br>
using a pressure syringe pump. The reaction temperature increased to 80 °C due to the<br>
exothermic reaction. After 5 hours of reaction at 80°C, the mixture was cooled to 30 °C and<br>
any salt byproducts were dissolved in 69 g of deionized water. Upon cooling and phase<br>
separation, a 229 gram organic phase was obtained. The organic phase yield was 95.4 percent<br>
based on the amount of CPTES used in the reaction. GC results of the organic phase showed<br>
0.9 percent of CPTES, 93.3 percent of MPTES, 0.4 percent of TESPM, and 1.0 percent of<br>
TESPD. Thus, it can be seen that the yield of MPTES was increased when H2S gas was used<br>
in this example of a reverse addition process.<br>
[0057] In the following examples, a series of experiments were performed using CO2 as the<br>
pH adjusting agent, at different CO2 pressure, to control the pH of reaction mixture and<br>
improve the yield of MPTES.<br>
[0058] A pressure reactor containing an NaHS solution was pressurized with CO2 gas to 25<br>
psi/173 kPa at room temperature before reacting it with CPTES in presence of a TBAB<br>
catalyst. The CO2 gas in water was slightly acidic due to the formation of carbonic acid,<br>
which in turn reacts with any Na2S byproduct in the NaHS solution to minimize TESPM<br>
formation, and to improve the overall yield of MPTES. Maintaining a positive pressure of<br>
CO2 during the reaction also minimized any hydrolysis of alkoxy groups and polymer<br>
formation.<br>
[0059] Thus, and similar to Example 12, 139.2 g (1.15 mole) of an NaHS solution was<br>
charged to the pressure reactor and the reactor was sealed. 10 psi/69 kPa CO2 pressure was<br>
applied and the contents were mixed for 5 minutes. The reaction mixture was heated to 70 °C<br>
and 9.6 g (0.015 mole) of aTBAB solution and 240.8 g (1.0 mole) of CPTES were added to<br>
the reactor by a pressure syringe at a controlled rate. The reaction was continued for 5 hours<br>
at 80 °C. The progress of the reaction was monitored by the GC analysis of the organic phase<br>
and the consumption of CPTES. After cooling the reaction mixture and phase separation, the<br>
organic phase was stripped to remove any low boilers and analyzed by GC. The product<br>
contained 0.3 weight percent of CPTES, 92.1 weight percent of MPTES, 2.3 weight percent<br>
of TESPM, and 0.5 weight percent of TESPD. The yield was 91.1 percent based on the<br>
amount of CPTES used.<br>
[0060] Except for CO2 pressure being increased to 50 psi/345 kPa, all other conditions<br>
were the same as Example 16. After phase separation, the organic phase was analyzed by GC,<br>
and it contained 0.5 weight percent of CPTES, 88.8 weight percent of MPTES, 1.3 weight<br>
percent of TESPM, and 2.6 weight percent of TESPD. Similar good results were obtained<br>
when the CO2 was continuously fed to the reactor during a reaction at 50 psi/345 kPa.<br>
[0061] Example 18 was repeated, except that the reaction was performed at 100 psi/690 kPa<br>
CO2 pressure. The pressure increased to 135 psi/932 kPa when the reaction mixture was<br>
heated to 70 °C. The pressure dropped during the CPTES addition as the NaHS was<br>
consumed in the reaction. The organic phase was isolated after completion of the reaction and<br>
analyzed. The product contained 2.3 weight percent of CPTES, 88.2 weight percent of<br>
MPTES, 0.9 weight percent of TESPM, and 2.8 weight percent of TESPD. Color in the<br>
product was removed by treatment with activated carbon black.<br>
[0062] Example 16 was repeated, except that the reaction was carried out under a 50<br>
psi/345 kPa CO2 gas pressure. NaCl and NaHCO3 salts were produced in the reaction. Upon<br>
cooling and phase separation, a 222.8 gram organic phase was obtained. The organic phase<br>
yield was 92.8 percent based on the amount of CPTES used in the reaction. GC results of the<br>
organic phase showed 0.8 percent of CPTES, 92.4 percent of MPTES, 1.2 percent of TESPM,<br>
and 0.5 percent of TESPD.<br>
[0063] The organic phase was also distilled under vacuum, and the product was collected at<br>
68 °C/1 mm Hg/0.133 kPa. After complete distillation, a small amount of solid polymer<br>
residue remained in the pot. The distillate contained 0.9 weight percent of CPTES and 98.0<br>
weight percent of MPTES.<br>
