COSMETIC COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING NIGROSPORA SPHAERICA EXTRACTS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to compositions for topical application to human skin which compositions contain extracts of Nigrospora sphaen'ca and to methods of using the compositions for treatment and conditioning, and particularly for lightening, of skin.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Many people are concerned with the degree of pigmentation of their skin. For example, people with age spots or freckles may wish such pigmented spots to be less pronounced. Others may wish to reduce the skin darkening caused by exposure to sunlight or to lighten their natural skin color. To meet this need, many attempts have been made to develop products that reduce pigment production in melanocytes. However, the substances identified thus far tend to have either low efficacy or undesirable side effects, such as, for example, toxicity or skin irritation. Therefore, there is a continuing need for new skin lightening agents, with improved overall effectiveness, as well as agents that lend themselves to ease of processing in their manufacture.<br>
The present invention is based at least in part on the discovery that extracts of the fungus Nigrospora sphaerica have at least comparable and/or demonstrably better skin lightening activity than known skin lightening agents. The use of Nigrospora sphaen'ca for cosmetic applications has not heretofore been known.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention alleviates the deficiencies of the prior art and includes, in part, a novel composition containing a pharmaceutically or cosmetically acceptable carrier and an extract of Nigrospora sphaerica.    The inventive compositions contain<br><br>
0.000001 to 50 % by weight of extract of Nigrospora sphaerica, and preferably, an organic solvent extract thereof. Preferably, the amount of the extract is 0.00001 % to 10% by weight, more preferably 0.001 % to about 7% by weight, and even more preferably 0.01 % to 5% by weight, to attain optimum skin lightening activity at a minimum cost.<br>
The inventive compositions further comprise a skin benefit agent and/or a sunscreen. The skin benefit agent is selected from alpha-hydroxy acids, beta-hydroxy acids, polyhydroxy acids,  hydroquinone,  t-butyl  hydroquinone; Vitamin  B  and/or C  derivatives  (e.g. niacinamide); dioic acids, retinoids, resorcinol derivatives, betuiinic acid, vanillic acid, betulinic acid, hydrolactin, and mixtures thereof.  Organic and inorganic (e.g. micronized metal oxides) sunscreens may also be included.   Organic sunscreens may include Benzophenone-3,   Benzophenone-4   ,   Benzophenone-8,   methoxycinnamate,   ethyl dihydroxypropyl-PABA, glyceryl PABA, homosalate, methyl anthranilate,   octocrylene, octyl dimethyl PABA, octyl methoxycinnamate (PARSOL MCX), octyl salicylate, PABA, 2-, phenylbenzimidazole-5-sulphonic acid, TEA salicylate, 3-(4-methylbenzylidene)-camphor, Benzophenone-1, Benzophenone-2, Benzophenone-6, Benzophenone-12, 4-isopropyl dibenzoyl methane, butyl methoxy dibenzoyl methane (PARSOL 1789), etocrylene, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The invention also includes methods of conditioning skin by applying topically thereto the inventive compositions containing extracts of Nigrospora sphaerica. The invention also includes a method of lightening the skin by applying thereto a composition comprising 0.000001% to 50% by weight of a Nigrospora sphaerica extract and a cosmetically acceptable carrier.<br>
The inventive compositions are useful in preventing or repairing such skin conditions as wrinkling, laxity, and photo damage. The inventive compositions and methods have effective skin lightening properties, may be easier to deliver to the skin, and are cost-effective and available from natural sources.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to compositions for topical application to human skin which compositions contain extracts of Nigrospora sphaerica and to methods of using the compositions for treatment and conditioning, and particularly for lightening, of skin.<br>
Nigrospora is a filamentous dematiaceous fungus widely distributed in soil, decaying plants, and seeds. Nigrospora colonies are rapid growing, compact, woolly, at first white, becoming gray with black areas and a black reverse color. Nigrospora sphaerica produce conidiophores which forcibly discharge the conidia. The Conidia are black, solitary, unicellular, slightly flattened horizontally, and have a thin equatorial germ slit. Nigrospora sphaerica, the best known species of the genus Nigrospora, may be found in the Hawaiian Islands and around the Pacific Ocean, among other places. The extracts of Nigrospora sphaerica suitable for use in the present compositions are organic solvent extracts, e.g., alcoholic extracts (methanol) or ethyl acetate extracts.<br>
According to the present invention, extracts of Nigrospora sphaerica must be presented in the composition in an amount of about 0.000001 % to about 50 % by weight of the composition. Preferably, the amount of the extract is about 0.00001 % to about 10%, more preferably about 0.001 % to about 7%, and even more preferably about 0.01 % to about 5%, to attain optimum skin lightening activity at a minimum cost.<br>
As used herein, the term "cosmetic composition" is intended to describe compositions for topical application to human skin.<br>
As used herein, the term "comprising" means including, made up of, composed of, consisting i     and/or consisting essentially of.<br><br>
The term "skin" as used herein includes the skin on the face, neck, chest, back, arms, axilla, hands, legs, and scalp.<br>
Except in the examples, or where otherwise explicitly indicated, all numbers in this description indicating amounts of material or conditions of reaction, physical properties of materials and/or use are to be understood as modified by the word "about". All amounts are by weight of the composition, unless otherwise specified. •<br>
It should be noted that in specifying any range of concentration, any particular upper concentration can be'associated with any particular lower concentration.<br>
NIGROSPORA SPHAERiCA<br>
The extracts according to the present invention are from a material of the kingdom of fungi; phylum of Ascomycota; genus of Nigrospora; and species of sphaerica. Nigrospora sphaerica, as used in accordance with the present invention, was harvested in the Hawaiian Islands and around the Pacific Ocean. After harvesting, the orga/iisms are grown in a first culture medium, from which the specific strain is isolated and removed to be grown In a second culture medium. The Nigrospora sphaerica is then isolated from the second culture medium, followed by extraction. The culture and extraction techniques used in accordance with the present invention are those known or further developed by those skilled in the art of microbiology. The particular culture protocol under which the microorganism was grown and the extraction protocol that was used to prepare the extracts that were screened are set forth hereinbelow. The culture and extraction protocols are further translated below into detailed recipes for media preparation and methods of extraction.<br>

COSMETICALLY ACCEPTABLE CARRIER<br>
The cosmetically acceptable vehicle may act as a dilutant, dispersant or carrier for the skin benefit ingredients in the composition, so as to facilitate their distribution when the composition is applied to the skin.<br>
The vehicle may be aqueous, anhydrous or an emulsion. Preferably, the compositions are aqueous or an emulsion, especially water-in-oil or oil-in-water emulsions, preferentially oil-in-water emulsions. Water when present will be in amounts which may range from 5 to 99%, preferably from 20 to 70%, optimally between 40 and 70% by weight.<br>
Besides water, relatively volatile solvents may also serve as carriers within the compositions of the present invention. Most preferred are monohydric d-C3 a/kanols. These include ethyl alcohol, methyl alcohol and isopropyl alcohol. The<br><br>
amount of monohydric alkanol may range from 1 to 70%, preferably from 10 to 50%, optimally between 15 to 40% by weight.<br>
Emollient materials may also serve as cosmetically acceptable carriers. These may be in the form of silicone oils and synthetic esters. Amounts of the emollients may range anywhere from 0.1 to 50%, preferably between 1 and 20% by weight.<br>
Silicone oils may be divided into the volatile and non-volatile variety. The term "volatile" as used herein refers to those materials which have a measurable vapor pressure at ambient temperature. Volatile silicone oils are preferably chosen from cyclic or linear polydimethylsiloxanes containing from 3 to 9, preferably from 4 to 5, silicon atoms. Linear volatile silicone materials generally have viscosities less than about 5 centistokes at 25°C while cyclic materials typically have viscosities of less than about 10 centistokes. Non-volatile silicone oils useful as an emollient material include polyalkyl siloxanes, polyalkylaryl siloxanes and polyether siloxane copolymers. The essentially non-volatile polyalkyl siloxanes useful herein include, for example, polydimethyl siloxanes with viscosities of from about 5 to about 25 million centistokes at 25°C. Among the preferred non-volatile emollients useful in the present compositions are the polydimethyl siloxanes having viscosities from about 10 to about 400 centistokes at 25°C.<br>
Among the ester emollients are:<br>
(1)	Alkenyl or alkyl esters of fatty acids having 10 to 20 carbon atoms. Examples thereof include isoarachidyl neopentanoate, isononyl isonanonoate, oleyl myristate, oleyl stearate, and oleyl oleate.<br>
(2)	Ether-esters such as fatty acid esters of ethoxylated fatty alcohols.<br>

(4)	Wax esters such as beeswax, spermaceti, myristyl myristate, stearyl stearate and arachidyl behenate.<br>
(5)	Sterol esters, of which cholesterol fatty acid esters are examples.<br>
Fatty acids having from 10 to 30 carbon atoms may also be included as cosmetically acceptable carriers for compositions of this invention. Illustrative of this category are pelargonic, lauric, myristic, palmitic, stearic, isostearic, hydroxystearic, oleic, linoleic, ricinoleic, arachidic, behenic and erucic acids.<br>
Humectants of the polyhydric alcohol-type may also be employed as cosmetically acceptable carriers in compositions of this invention. The humectant aids in increasing the effectiveness of the emollient, reduces scaling, stimulates removal of built-up scale and improves skin feel. Typical polyhydric alcohols include glycerol, polyalkylene glycols and more preferably alkylene polyols and their derivatives, including propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, polyethylene glycol and derivatives thereof, sorbitol, hydroxypropyl sorbitol, hexylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, 1,2,6-hexanetriol, ethoxylated glycerol, propoxylated glycerol and mixtures thereof. For best results the humectant is preferably propylene glycol or sodium hyaluronate. The amount of humectant may range anywhere from 0,5 to 30%, preferably between 1 and 15% by weight of the composition.<br>
Thickeners may also be utilized as part of the cosmetically acceptable carrier of compositions according to the present invention.     Typical thickeners include<br><br>
crosslinked acrylates (e.g. Carbopol 982), hydrophobically-modified acrylates (e.g. Carbopol 1382), taurate polymer, cellulosic derivatives and natural gums. Among useful cellulosic derivatives are sodium carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and hydroxymethyl cellulose.

Amounts of the thickener may range from 0.0001 to 5%, usually from 0.001 to 1%, optimally from 0.01 to 0.5% by weight.<br>
Collectively the water, solvents, silicones, esters, fatty acids, humectants and/or thickeners will constitute the cosmetically acceptable carrier in amounts from 1 to 99.9%, preferably from 80 to 99% by weight.<br>
An oil or oily material may be present, together with an emulsifier to provide either a water-in-oil emulsion or an oil-in-water emulsion, depending largely on the average hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) of the emulsifier employed.<br>
Surfactants may also be present in cosmetic compositions of the present invention. Total concentration of the surfactant will range from 0.1 to 40%, preferably from 1 to 20%, optimally from 1 to 5% by weight of the composition. The surfactant may be selected from the group consisting of anionic, nonionic, cationic and amphoteric actives. Particularly preferred nonionic surfactants are those with a C10-C20 fatty alcohol or acid hydrophobe condensed with from 2 to 100 moles of ethylene oxide or propylene oxide per mole of hydrophobe; C2-C10 alkyl phenols condensed with from 2 to 20 moles of alkylene oxide; mono- and di- fatty acid esters of ethylene glycol; fatty acid monoglyceride; sorbitan, mono- and di- C8-C20 fatty acids; block copolymers (ethylene oxide/propylene oxide); and polyoxyethylene sorbitan as well as combinations thereof. Alkyl polyglycosides and saccharide fatty amides (e.g. methyl gluconamides) are also suitable nonionic surfactants.<br>
Preferred anionic surfactants include soap, alkyl ether sulfate and sulfonates, alkyl sulfates and sulfonates, alkylbenzene sulfonates, alkyl and dialkyl sulfosuccinates,<br><br>
C8-C20 acyl isethionates, acyl glutamates, C8-C20 alkyl ether phosphates and combinations thereof.<br>
OPTIONAL COMPONENTS<br>
In the cosmetic compositions of the invention, there may be optionally added plasticizers; calamine; antioxidants; chelating agents; as well as sunscreens.<br>
Other adjunct minor components may also be incorporated into the cosmetic compositions. These ingredients may include coloring agents, pigments, opadfiers, and perfumes. Amounts of these other adjunct minor components may range anywhere from 0.001 % up to 20% by weight of the composition.<br>
For use as a sunscreen, metal oxides may be used alone or in mixture and/or in combination with organic sunscreens. Examples of organic sunscreens include but are not limited to those set forth in the table below.<br>
The amount of the organic sunscreens in the cosmetic composition is preferably in the range of about 0.1 wt % to about 10 wt %, more preferably about 1 wt % to 5 wt %.      Preferred organic sunscreens are PARSOL MCX and Parsol 1789, due to their effectiveness and commercial availability.<br><br><br>
USE OF THE COMPOSITION<br>
The fungal extracts and compositions according to the invention are intended primarily as a personal care product for topical application to human skin, as well as to lighten the skin, to reduce the degree of pigmentation in the skin, or to even the skin tone.<br><br>
In use, a small quantity of the composition, for example from 1 to 5 ml, is applied to exposed areas of the skin, from a suitable container or applicator and, if necessary, it is then spread over and/or rubbed into the skin using the hand or fingers or a suitable device.<br>
PRODUCT FORM AND PACKAGING<br>
The cosmetic composition of the invention can be formulated as a lotion having a viscosity of from 4,000 to 10,000 mPas, a fluid cream having a viscosity of from 10,000 to 20, 000 rnPas, or a cream having a viscosity of from 20,000 to 100,000 mPas or above. The composition can be packaged in a suitable container to suit its viscosity and intended use by the consumer. For example, a lotion or fluid cream can be packaged in a bottle or a roll-ball applicator or a propellant-driven aerosol device or a container fitted with a pump suitable for finger operation. When the composition is a cream, it can simply be stored in a non-deformable bottle or squeeze container, such as a tube or a lidded jar. When the composition is a solid or semi-solid stick, it may be packaged in a suitable container for manually or mechanically pushing out or extruding the composition.<br>
The invention accordingly also provides a dosed container containing a cosmeticallv acceptable composition as herein defined.<br>
The following examples are by way of example, not by way of limitation, of the principles of the present invention, to illustrate the best mode of carrying out the invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
This example illustrates reduction in new melanin synthesis using the inventive extracts of Nigrospora sphaerica.<br><br>
The extracts of Nigrospora shpaerica used throughout the examples that follow were prepared in accordance with the procedures set forth hereinabove.<br>
Organ Culture Method<br>
Waste skin from 8-month old pigmented pigs was shaved to remove hairs and washed thoroughly to remove debris and reduce microbial content. The cleaned skin was then demnatomed to approximately 1-mm thickness x 75-cm2 and placed in tissue culture fiasks containing Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM Cat#1188507) containing penicillin (100-units/ml), streptomycin (100-ug/ml), kanamycin (200-ug/ml), glutamine (2-mM), and fungizone (0.5-ug/ml). All flasks were incubated overnight at 37°C in the presence of 5% carbon dioxide. This allowed the skin to equilibrate for 18 hours prior to the addition of melanin inhibitors. Areas of the skin that had scratches, erythema, or uneven pigmentation were discarded.<br>
The following morning, the skin was punched into 4-mm diameter biopsies and transferred to a 96-well tissue culture plate. To each well containing a biopsy, 180-microliters of fresh DMEM containing penicillin (100-units/ml), streptomycin (100-μg/ml), glutamine (2-mM), hydrocortisone (100-ug/ml) and 0.4-μCi/ml 14C-thiouracil (Moravek Biochemicals) was added along with 20-microliters of natural extract (extracts were initially dissolved in DMSO, i.e., dimethyl sulfoxide, and diluted with phosphate buffered saline). All the plates were returned to the incubator for three days.<br>
Following a three day incubation period, excess unincorporated radiolabel was removed by washing the biopsies at room temperature two times with 0.1 M carbonate buffer at pH 10 for 30 minutes and 2 hours respectively using an automated plate washer. Biopsies were then bleached and dissolved by addition of 100-microliters of 1N NaOH/3% H2O2 followed by incubation overnight at 60°C.<br>
Once dry, 50-microliters of 2N-HCI was added to each well to re-dissolve/neutralize the samples followed by the addition of 220-microliters of scintillation cocktail (Packard MicroScint-40). The samples were mixed several times   to   ensure   even   dispersion,   sealed,   and   assessed   for   radiolabel<br><br>
incorporation using a Packard TopCount scintillation counter. A reduction in - radiolabel incorporation translates to a reduction in new melanin synthesis.<br>

EXAMPLE 2<br>
MelanoDerm Tissue Model Method<br>
A MelanoDerm tissue equivalent model (MEL-300 from Mat Tek, Ashland, Massachusetts) containing melanocytes obtained from dark skin individuals was utilized to confirm the results obtained in the pig organ culture. MelanoDerms were cultured as per the supplier instructions.<br>
Medium was replaced every two days over a 14-day period and treatments including the natural extracts were added to the medium phase at a final concentration of 50 and 100-micrograms per ml. Positive control was included, i.e., kojic acid, which is a known skin lightening agent. During each medium change, a portion of the waste was analyzed for levels of lactate dehydrogenase as an indicator of cellular toxicity and stress. At no time was the level of lactate dehydrogenase above the vehicle control solvents (water or ethanol).<br>
Determination of melanin content within each MelanoDerm was performed using the assay provided by the manufacturer. Each MelanoDerm was homogenized in 450-microliters of buffer (1% SDS, 0.05-mM EDTA, 10-mM Tris-HCI, pH 6.8) containing 20-microliters of Proteinase K (5 mg/ml) and incubated overnight at 45°C. The following day,<br><br>
50-microliters of sodium carbonate (500-mM) and 10-microliters of hydrogen peroxide (30% solution) was added to each sample and incubated at 80°C for 30 minutes and then cooled. The optical density of the top phase was determined (405-nm) following extraction of the sample with 100-microliters of chloroform:methanol (2:1) and centrifugation (10,000 g) for ten minutes. Optical density readings relative to the untreated or vehicle control (water or ethanol) were then calculated.<br>
