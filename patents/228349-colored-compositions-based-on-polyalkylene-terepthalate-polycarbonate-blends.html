				<td> The present invention relates to a colored compositions based on polyalkylene terepthalate/polycarbonate blends <br>
The present invention relates to coloured compositions based on polyalkylene terephthalate/polycarbonate blends modified with impact resistance, and moulding compositions, semi-finished products and moulded parts manufactured from them, which are used either un-lacquered or coated only with a transparent clear lacquer for example for external automotive applications.<br>
Moulding compositions modified with impact resistance, which contain partially crystalline polyesters, amorphous polycarbonates and graft copolymers are known. Such moulding compositions are used for example in the automotive sector for moulded parts such as bumpers, mudguards, radiator grilles, panels, rear panels, sills, spoilers, door handles, tank covers, coatings, horizontal components such as bonnets or roof elements, door modules or similar. The preconditions for use in automotive applications are high resistance to thermoforming, high flowability in the melt, good lacquer adhesion, high resistance to chemicals, high rigidity, high dimensional stability and high low-temperature toughness.<br>
Moulded parts of polyalkylene terephthalate/polycarbonate blends modified with impact resistance are normally lacquered with a colouring lacquer, known as the base lacquer. Before the base lacquer, the moulded parts can optionally also be coated with primer and/or filler. A transparent clear lacquer can also optionally be applied to the base lacquer. These systems are referred to below as top coat lacquered systems. In the top coat lacquered system, the natural colour of the moulding composition itself is immaterial as it is coloured by the base lacquer.<br>
As an alternative to top coat lacquer systems, there are systems that are referred to below as penetration-dyed systems. In penetration-dyed systems, the colour of the moulded part in the application is determined by the natural colour of the moulded part itself, which means that penetration-dyed systems are not lacquered with a primer, filler or colouring base lacquer. However, the penetration-dyed systems may<br><br>
optionally be coated with a transparent clear lacquer. The advantage of penetration-dyed systems lies in the cost savings, as the work processes of priming with primer and/or fillers and the lacquering with a colouring base lacquer and the associated drying are not required.<br>
In penetration-dyed systems, however, there is no covering base lacquer to provide a UV blocking function. At best, a UV clear lacquer can block the majority of the damaging UV radiation from penetration-dyed systems. Moulding compositions that are based on penetration-dyed systems must nevertheless have high UV stability, which means that impact resistance modifiers based on rubbers containing conjugated dienes, such as for example butadiene in ABS- or MBS rubbers, cannot be used.<br>
Weather-resistant PC/polyester blends therefore use, for example, acrylate rubbers, as disclosed in DE-A1 3302124.<br>
EP-Bl 0 787 769 discloses the use of PC/polyester blends containing a combination of AES and acrylate rubbers to obtain moulding compositions with improved weather-resistance and good toughness.<br>
However in penetration-dyed systems, in addition to weather-resistance, the ability to be homogeneously coloured is of very great importance. It is precisely when using PC/polyester blends modified with impact resistance containing acrylate impact resistance modifiers for injection moulded parts, that undesirable inhomogeneity of colour occurs, in which regularly-recurring less-deeply-coloured areas, which appear optically lighter, together with more-deeply-coloured areas, which appear optically darker or more intensely-coloured, are formed vertically to the direction of flow during the injection moulding process. These are known as tiger stripes. For moulded parts that are visible to the user in their final application such as for example the external bodywork of a motor vehicle - such as e.g. mudguards, bumpers, tailgate, panel, spoiler, air intake grille, bonnet, car roof -,<br><br>
motor vehicle interior, casing for electrical equipment, casing for electronic<br>
equipment, these tiger stripe effects are unacceptable.<br>
The object was to develop homogeneously-coloured polyalkylene terephthalate/<br>
polycarbonate moulding compositions modified with impact resistance for<br>
applications in so-called penetration-dyed systems. Penetration-dyed systems place<br>
increased demands on homogeneous colouring of the moulding compositions or<br>
moulded parts, as the colouring of the moulding composition is at the same time for<br>
the appearance of the colour of the finished moulded part in the application.<br>
Practical experience shows, that materials used for automotive applications may<br>
have large variations in the listed properties, depending on the actual area of use.<br>
However, the ability to be coloured homogeneously is the decisive factor for<br>
applications in penetration-dyed systems. This ability to be coloured homogeneously<br>
is a key criterion for the use of the material in penetration-dyed systems, in addition<br>
to the material properties already mentioned, such as for example the stiffness of the<br>
material, resistance to thermoforming and low-temperature impact resistance.<br>
Surprisingly, it was found that coloured polyalkylene terephthalate/polycarbonate<br>
blends modified with impact resistance by means of impact resistance modifiers<br>
based on graft copolymer compositions based on acrylonitrile/ethylene propylene<br>
rubbers/styrene (AES) can be produced, that result in moulded parts with very<br>
homogeneous colouring. The moulding compositions according to the invention are<br>
also characterised by high resistance to thermoforming, high flowability in the melt,<br>
good lacquer adhesion, high resistance to chemicals, high rigidity, high dimensional<br>
stability and high low-temperature toughness. As AES rubbers contain no doublebond<br>
groups, they are also UV-stable.<br>
The invention provides compositions containing<br>
A) 40 to 80, preferably 10 to 60, particularly preferably 12 to 40, in particular<br>
19 to 29 wt.% of at least one polyalkylene terephthalate, preferably a<br>

preferably a polyethylene terephthalate,<br>

According to the invention, the compositions contain as component A one or a<br>
mixture of two or more different polyalkylene terephthalates. Polyalkylene<br>
terephthalates according to the invention are polyalkylene terephthalates, which are<br>
derived from terephthalic acid (or its reactive derivatives) and alkane diols, for<br>
example based on ethylene glycol, propylene glycol or butane diol. According to the<br>
invention, preferably polybutylene terephthalate, polytrimethylene terephthalate<br>

anhydrides) and aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or araliphatic diols and mixtures of these<br>
reaction products.<br>
Preferred polyalkylene terephthalates can be produced from terephthalic acid (or its<br>
reactive derivatives) and aliphatic or cycloaliphatic diols having 2 to I O C atoms by<br>
known methods (Kunststoff-Handbuch, Vol. VIII, p. 695 ff, Karl-Hanser-Verlag,<br>
Munich 1973).<br>
Preferred polyalkylene terephthalates contain at least 80, preferably 90 mol.%, in<br>

acid groups, up to 20 mol.% of groups of other aromatic dicarboxylic acids having 8<br>
to 14 C atoms or aliphatic dicarboxylic acids having 4 to 12 C atoms, such as groups<br>
of phthalic acid, isophthalic acid, naphthaline-2,6-dicarboxylic acid, 4,4'-diphenyl<br>

The polyalkylene terephthalates may be branched by incorporating relatively small<br>
quantities of 3- or 4-valent alcohols or 3- or 4-basic carboxylic acids, as disclosed<br>
e.g. in DE-A 19 00 270 and US-A 3 692 744. Examples of preferred branching<br>
agents are trimesic acid, trimellitic acid, trimethylol ethane and -propane and<br>
pentaerythritol.<br>
It is advisable to use no more than 1 mol.% of the branching agent in relation to the<br>
acid component.<br>
Polyalkylene terephthalates, which have been produced solely from terephthalic acid<br>
and its reactive derivatives (e.g. its dialkyl esters) and ethylene glycol and/or<br>
propane diol-1,3 and/or butane diol-1,4 (polyethylene- and polybutylene<br>
terephthalate) and mixtures of these polyalkylene terephthalates, are preferred in<br>
particular.<br>
Preferred polyalkylene terephthalates are also copolyesters, which are produced<br>
from at least two of the above-mentioned acid components and/or from at least two<br>

The bisphenols disclosed according to the general formula (I) can be produced by<br>
known processes, e.g. from the corresponding phenols and ketones.<br>
The stated bisphenols and processes for producing them are disclosed for example in<br>
the monograph H. Schnell "Chemistry and Physics of Polycarbonates", Polymer<br>
Reviews, Volume 9, p. 77-98, Interscience Publishers, New York, London, Sydney,<br>
1964 and in US-A 3 028 635, in US-A 3 062 781, in US-A 2 999 835, in US-A 3<br>
148 172, in US-A 2 991 273, in US-A 3 271 367, in US-A 4 982 014, in US-A 2 999<br>

956, in DE-A 3 832 396, and in FR-A 1 561 518 as well as in the Japanese laid open<br>
specifications with the application numbers JP-A 62039 1986, JP-A 62040 1986 and<br>
JP-A 105550 1986.<br>
l,l-bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3,3,5-trimethyl cyclohexane and its production are<br>
disclosed e.g. in US-A 4 982 014.<br>
Indane bisphenols and their production are disclosed for example in US-A 3 288<br>
864, in JP-A 60 035 150 and in US-A 4 334 106. Indane bisphenols may be<br>
produced, for example, from isopropenyl phenol or its derivatives or from dimers of<br>
isopropenyl phenol or its derivatives in the presence of a Friedel-Craft-Catalyst in<br>
organic solvents.<br>
Polycarbonates can also be produced by known processes. Suitable processes for the<br>
production of polycarbonates are, for example, production from bisphenols with<br>
phosgene by the phase interface process or from bisphenols with phosgene by the<br>
homogeneous phase process, the so-called pyridine process, or from bisphenols with<br>
carbonic acid esters by the melt transesterification process. These production<br>
processes are disclosed e.g. in H. Schnell, "Chemistry and Physics of<br>
Polycarbonates", Polymer Reviews, Volume 9, p. 31-76, Interscience Publishers,<br>
New York, London, Sydney, 1964. The stated production processes are also<br>
disclosed in D. Freitag, U. Grigo, P. R. Miiller, H. Nouvertne "Polycarbonates" in<br>
Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Engineering, Volume 11, Second Edition,<br>
1988, pages 648 to 718 and in U. Grigo, K. Kircher and P.R. Mttller<br>
"Polycarbonate" in Becker, Braun, Kunststoff-Handbuch, Volume 3/1,<br>
Polycarbonate, Polyacetale, Polyester, Celluloseester, Carl Hanser Verlag Munich,<br>

07960, "Synthesis of Poly(ester carbonate) Copolymers" in Journal of Polymer<br>
Science, Polymer Chemistry Edition, Vol. 9, 75-90 (1980).<br>
The melt transesterification process is disclosed in particular in H. Schnell<br>
"Chemistry and Physics of Polycarbonates", Polymer Reviews, Volume 9, p. 44 to<br>
51, Interscience Publishers, New York, London, Sydney, 1964 and also in DE-A 1<br>
031 512, in US-A 3 022 272, in US-A 5 340 905 and in US-A 5 399 659.<br>
When producing polycarbonate, raw materials and auxiliary substances with a low<br>
level of impurities are preferably used. In particular for production by the melt<br>
transesterification process, the bisphenols used and the carbonic acid derivatives<br>
used should be as free as possible from alkali ions and earth alkali ions. Such pure<br>
raw materials can be obtained, for example, by re-crystallising, washing or distilling<br>
the carbonic acid derivatives, for example carbonic acid esters, and the bisphenols.<br>
The polycarbonates suitable according to the invention preferably have a weight<br>
average of the molar masses (Mw), which can be determined e.g. by<br>
ultracentrifugation or light scattering measurement, of 10 000 to 200 000 g/mol.<br>
Particularly preferably, they have a weight average of the molar masses of 12 000 to<br>
80 000 g/mol, in particular of 20 000 to 35 000 g/mol.<br>
The average molar mass of the polycarbonates according to the invention can be set,<br>
for example, in the known way by a corresponding quantity of chain stoppers. The<br>
chain stoppers can be used individually, or as a mixture of different chain stoppers.<br>
Suitable chain stoppers are both monophenols and monocarboxylic acids. Suitable<br>
monophenols are e.g. phenol, p-chlorophenol, p-tert.-butyl phenol, cumyl phenol or<br>
2,4,6-tribromophenol, and also long-chain alkyl phenols, such as e.g. 4-(l,l,3,3-<br>
tetramethylbutyl)-phenol or monoalkyl phenols or dialkyl phenols having a total of 8<br>
to 20 C atoms in the alkyl substituents such as e.g. 3,5-di-tert.-butyl phenol, p-tertoctyl<br>
phenol, p-dodecyl phenol, 2-(3,5-diemthyl-heptyl)-phenol or 4-(3,5-dimethylheptyl)-<br>
phenol. Suitable monocarboxylic acids are benzoic acids, alkyl benzoic<br>
acids and halogen benzoic acids.<br>
Preferred chain stoppers are phenol, p-tert.-butyl phenol, 4-(l,l,3,3-tetramethyl<br>
butyl)-phenol and cumyl phenol.<br>
The quantity of chain stoppers is preferably 0.25 to 10 mol.% in relation to the total<br>
of the bisphenols used in each case.<br>
The polycarbonates suitable according to the invention can be branched in the<br>
known way, and preferably by incorporating trifunctional or more-than-trifunctional<br>
branching agents. Suitable branching agents are e.g. those having three or more than<br>

processes to form semi-finished products or moulded parts of all kinds. Examples of<br>
processing methods are extrusion and injection moulding. Examples of semifinished<br>
products are films and sheets.<br>

applications that are visible and optically significant. The moulded parts may be<br>
used according to the invention un-lacquered or coated with a transparent clear<br>
lacquer system. The moulded parts may be small or large and may be used for<br>
external or internal applications. Large moulded parts are preferably produced for<br>
vehicle construction, in particular in the automobile sector. External bodywork parts<br>
in particular can be manufactured from the moulding compositions according to the<br>

according to the invention may also be found in composites with other materials<br>
such as e.g. metal or plastic. The moulding compositions according to the invention<br>
or the moulded parts/semi-finished products made from the moulding compositions<br>
according to the invention can be used by means of the conventional techniques for<br>
connecting and joining several components or parts such as e.g. coextrusion, film<br>
back spraying, spray coating of union ends, gluing, welding, screwing or clamping<br>
in composite structures with other materials or themselves for the production of<br>
finished parts such as e.g. external bodywork parts.<br>
The moulding compositions according to the invention can also be used for<br>
numerous other applications. Examples are the use in electrics and electronics and in<br>
the building industry. In the stated applications, moulded parts made of the<br>
moulding compositions according to the invention can be used for example as lamp<br>
covers, safety screens, as a case material for electronic devices, as a case material<br>
for domestic appliances, as sheets for the production of covers.<br>

produced at a composition temperature of 270°C, a mould temperature of 80°C and<br>
a fill speed of 50 mm/s through a film feed on one 105 mm side.<br>
As can be seen from Table 1, the moulding compositions according to the invention<br>
have very good homogeneity of colour and at the same time good mechanical<br>
properties. In comparison with the reference examples Ref. 1 and Ref. 3, which have<br>
poorer homogeneity of colour, the toughness of Ref. 1 and Ref. 3 was exceeded by<br>
Example 2 even with a reduced content of AES rubber.<br>
The composition and properties of the thermoplastic moulding compositions<br>
according to the invention can be seen in (Table Removed)<br><br><br><br><br><br>
We claim:<br>
1.	Composition characterized by its color homogeneity consisting of<br>
A)	4 to 80 wt. % of at least one polyalkylene terephthalate;<br>
B)	10 to 90 wt. % of at least one aromatic polycarbonate based on bisphenol A;<br>
C)	1.5 to 30 wt. % of at least one AES graft polymer;<br>
D)	0 to 54 wt. % of at least one mineral filler in particle form of the kind such as herein described;<br>
E)	0.01 to 10 wt.% of at least one colouring material selected from<br>
the group consisting of titanium dioxide, ultramarine blue, iron<br>
oxide, carbon black, phthalocyanine, quinacridone, perylene,<br>
nigrosin and anthraquinone;<br>
F)	0 to 10 wt.% of at least one other additive selected from the<br>
group consisting of stablisers, anti-statics, flow auxiliary<br>
substances, mould release agents, fire-protection additives,<br>
emulsifiers, nucleating agents, plasticisers, mould lubricants,<br>
pH-reducing additives, additives to increase conductivity, dyes<br>
and pigments.<br>
2.	Composition as claimed in claim 1, wherein C is composed of graft<br>
polymers of<br>
C1) 5 to 95 wt.%, preferably 10 to 80 wt.%, in particular 20 to 50 wt.% of at least one vinyl monomer;<br>
C2) 95 to 5 wt.%, preferably 90 to 20, in particular 80 to 20 wt. % of one or more grafting bases having glass transition temperatures   of the   rubber  component   
 <br>
3.	Composition as claimed in one or more of the preceding claims, wherein polyethylene terephthalate is used as component A.<br>
