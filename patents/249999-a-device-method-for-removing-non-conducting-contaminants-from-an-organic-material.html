				<td>This invention relates to a device for removing contaminantsfrom a flow of material. In particular, it relates -to a device which detects and removes nonconducting contaminants from an organic material such as tobacco stem.<br>
The presence of contaminants in organic materials such as food and tobacco is an unwanted and potentially dangerous problem, and the quality and safety of the organic matenai, ana therefore the end product, can be reduced by such contaminants being present<br>
Traditional methods of removing contaminants manually, fpr example by passing the organic material along a conveyor belt and removing contaminants by hand, are time-consuming and can be affected by human error. Similarly, any kind of sieving process is unreliable, as no contaminant which is larger than or equal to the pieces of organic material in size can be filtered. A thorough sieving process may also be extremejy time-consuming and difficult to maintain. Processes currently in use are therefore unreliable, and there is a need in industry for a quick and reliable method for removing contaminants from organic materials.<br>
The present invention seeks to overcome the aforementioned problems, and to provide an. efficient method of detecting and removing contaminant from organic material, thereby improving the quality of the final product to be manufactured.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a device for removing nonconducting contaminants from an organic material, the device comprising:<br>
an ion beam generator for generating, in use, an ion beam;<br>
a conductive surface, separated from the ion beam; and<br>
a contaminant detection system and a deflector wherein;<br>
the detection system generates an output based upon detected characteristics of the ion beam, and<br>
the deflector separates the detected non-conducting contaminants from the organic material based on the output of the detection system.<br>
According to the present invention there is also provided a method for removing non-conducting contaminants from an organic material, the method comprising the steps of:<br>
generating an ion beam;<br>
directing said ion beam towards a conductive surface;<br>
detecting changes in the ion beam to detect the non-conducting contaminants; and<br>
controlling a deflector via the detector output to<br>
separate the non-conductive contaminants from the organic material.<br>
The continuous ion beam may be generated by applying a current to a plurality of conductive points.<br>
The charged non-conducting contaminants may be electrostatically attracted towards the conductive surface, which may be grounded or oppositely charged to the ion beam in use.<br>
The detection system may also contain an electronic sensor.<br>
The present invention introduces an improved method for the detection and removal of non-conducting contaminants from organic material. The use of electrostatics allows a faster and more thorough method of detection and removal than methods currently implemented in industry as it does not rely on manual operation, and human error can therefore be eliminated. The flow of organic material does not rest in any part of the device, making the device itself easier to clean and maintain, and the contaminants are detected without contact The present invention leads to improved reliability in the processing of materials such as tobacco stem, and an improved quality in the end products.<br>
Examples of the present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a side view of a device according to the invention..<br>
Referring to figure 1, a device 1 according to the invention has an ion beam ) generator 2, a conductive, rotatable drum 7, a scraper 8 and a reject bin 12. The ion beam generator 2 typically comprises a plurality of high voltage generators 3, a resistor 4 of around 100MD and a plurality of conductive needle points 5 which are placed at intervals along the width of the device. When the device is switched on, the high voltage generators 3 apply a current to each of the plurality of needle points 5 via the 100MQ resistor 4. The high voltage is typically 30 000V positive. The conductive, rotatable drum is connected to electrical ground or is oppositely charged to the ion beam.  A continuous positive ion discharge in the form of a plurality, of beams 6 occurs between the plurality of needle points 5 and the drum 7. In some cases the needle point 5 may be hollow to allow a gas under pressure to be ejected therefrom to improve ion transport, cooling and focussing.When the device 1 is in use, tobacco stem 10 is introduced into a chute 9 by a pneumatic conveyor (not shown), and falls into the device. The tobacco stem 10 is spread across the width of the device and falls through the gap between the plurality of needle points 5 and the drum 7, which rotates at the same rate as the flow of tobacco stem 10 when the device is in use. The tobacco stem 10 therefore flows through the ion beams 6. Because tobacco stem, like all organic material, contains moisture and impurities, it is conductive. At a high voltage such as 30 000V and at a regulated current the beams 6 pass through the tobacco stem 10 without interruption.<br>
If, however, any type of non-conducting contaminant 11, such as plastic material, is positioned in the beams 6, the contaminant 11 is given a positive charge and is attracted to the conductive, rotatable drum 7. If the contaminants 11 are light in weight they stick to the drum 7 and are earned to a scraper (not shown). The scraper then deposits the contaminants in a reject bin 12.<br>
If, however, the contaminants 11 are heavier, other detection and removal means are required. Accordingly, the device 1 also comprises means for detecting arid removing heavier contaminants. When in use, the device operates as follows. The non-conducting contaminants 11 will interrupt some of the ion beams 6 and will also reflect.some of the ions as they pass through the. gap between the plurality of needles 5 and the drum 7. This interruption can be measured in. order to detect the presence of the contaminants and remove them from the flow of organic material.<br>
Firstly, the interruption will cause the current of the Ion beam 6 to change, and this can be measured using opto-couplers and amplifiers (not shown).<br>
Secondly, a sensor 13 can be placed below the ion beam generator 2. If the sensor 13 is positioned at a slightly greater distance from the plurality of needle points 5 than the drum 7 (shown in dotted lines), an easier route to ground will be presented for an ion beam that has been interrupted. The ion beam 6 will completely transfer to the sensor (electrode?) 13 and can be easily and safely measured by a simple electronic comparator 14.<br>
As shown in figure 1, the sensor 13 can also be positioned so that the gap between the sensor 13 and the plurality of needle points 5 is much greater than the gap between the plurality of needle points 5 and the drum 7. In this case, the system acts in an analogue mode whereby the number of reflected ions is determined by the average diameter of the contaminant 11. This method of detection is capable, after<br>
amplification, of producing even greater sensitivity for the detection of small contaminants at high speed.<br>
After the contaminants have been detected, they must be removed reliably from the flow of organic material. The output of the opto-couplers (not shown) or comparator 14 can be connected to a pneumatic deflector 15, and drives trie deflector 15. The deflector then moves according to the output so as to place detected contaminants 11 in a reject bin 12, or to allow tobacco stem 10 that is uncontaminated to continue uninterrupted onto a conveyor belt 16.<br>
The present invention therefore provides a fast, robust and reliable method of finding contaminants, such as plastic material, in organic materials, such as tobacco stem.<br>
The above example shows a device which is operated in air, but it would also be possible for a device to operate in a air/gas or gas only environment to improve the quality and control of the ion beam. Furthermore, whilst in the above example the electrical potential is such that the ion beam generator is at a positive potential with respect to the surface of the drum, this is not an essential requirement In certain circumstances it would be beneficial to have the generator at a negative potential to improve the detection characteristics. Furthermore, by providing an alternating potential, possibly alternating between positive and negative values, detection can be further improved and can allow better penetration of the organic material from which the contaminant needs to be separated.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
