Control of Arthropods in Animals<br>
Tre present invention relates to a method of control of parasites in animals, compositions comprising a compound effective for the sale control and compounds effective against parasites.<br>
!t is generally a goal of agronomists and veterinarians to possess sufficient means to<br>
con™i pests, particularly arthropods, when they attempt to invade or attack<br>
mammais, particularly domestic animals and/ or livestock. A c;assical method of<br>
controlling such pests has been the use of topical and/or systemic pesticides on or in<br>
the domestic animal which is being attacked. Generally effective treatments include<br>
the oral administration of insect growth regulators, such as lufenuron, or antiheiminth<br>
compounds such as an ivermectin or an avermectin, or the topical application of the<br>
insecticide fipronil. It is advantageous to apply pesticides tc animals in oral form so<br>
as tc prevent the possible contamination of humans or the surrounding environment.<br>
!t is an object of the present invention to provide new pesticides which may be used<br>
in domestic animals.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide safer pesticides for domestic animals.<br>
Another object of the invention Is to provide new pesticioes for domestic animais that<br>
.•ray be used in lower doses than existing pesticides.<br>
These objects are met in whole or in part by the present invention.<br>
US 5,079,370, EP-A 0,846,686, WO 98/24769 and WO 97/23126 disclose the use of<br>
sr/ipyrazoles as parasiticidai agents. However, these references are completely<br>
silent on the problem that anti parasitical agents cften elicit emesis in the animal to<br>
be protected or cured from the parasites.<br>
The cresert invention crevices a method of ccntrcilinc sarasliss in or en an animai<br>

administerina.<br>
The present invention aisc relates to a method of cleaning anima.s •- coed health<br>
comprising the application to the animal of a compound of formula (!) cr a sait<br>
thereof as hereinbefore defined to the animal.<br>
The method of cleaning an animal is not a method of treatment by therapy of the<br>
animal body per se, because<br><br>
(a)	the animal is in good health and requires no substantial treatment to correct a deficiency of health;<br>
(b)	the cleaning of the animal is not intended to be done by veterinary personnel, but by persons interested in the cleaning of the animal; and<br>
(c)	the purpose of such cleaning is to avoid unpleasant conditions for humans and the environment in which humans inhabit so as to not infest the said humans with arthropods carried by the animal.<br>
By "carrier" is meant an organic or inorganic material, which can be natural or synthetic, and which is associated with the compound and which facilitates its application to the animal. This carrier is thus generally inert and should be arthropocidally acceptable. The carrier can be solid (e.g., clay, silicates, silica, resins, wax.) or liquid (e.g., water, alcohols, ketones, oil solvents, polar aprotic solvents) An example of an oil solvent is corn oil. An example of a polar aprotic solvent is dimethyl sulfoxide.<br>
The compounds of the invention also have utility in the control of arthropod or nematode pests of plants. The active compound is generally applied to the locus in which arthropod or nematode infestation is to be controlled at a rate cf about 0.C05 kg to about 25 kg of active compound per hectare of locus treated, preferably 0.02 tc 2 kg/ha. Under ideal conditions, depending on the pest to be controlled, the lower rate may offer adequate protection. On the other hand, adverse weather conditions, resistance of the pest and other factors may require that the active ingredient be used in higher proportions. For foliar application, a rate cf 0.01 to 1 kg/ha may be used.<br>
When the pest is soil-borne, the formulation containing the active ccmpcur.c is distributed evenly over the area to be treated in any convenient manner. Application may be made, if desired, to the field or crop-growing area generally cr in close proximity to the seed or plant to be protected from attack. The active component can be washed into the soil by spraying with water over the area or can be left tc the natural action of rainfall. During or after application, the formulation can, if desired, be distributed mechanically in the soil, for example by ploughing or disking.<br><br>
Application can be prior to planting, at planting, after planting but before sprouting has taken place or after sprouting.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be applied in solid or liquid compositions to the soil principally to control those nematodes dwelling therein but also to the foliage principally to control those nematodes attacking the aerial parts of the plants 
The compounds of the invention are of value in controlling pests which feed on parts of the plant remcte from the point of application, e.g. leaf feeding insects are Killed by the subject compounds applied to roots. In addition the compounds may reduce attacks on the plant by means of antifeeding or repellent effects. The compounds of the invention are of particular value in the protection of field, forage, plantation, glasshouse, orchard and vineyard crops, or ornamentals and of plantation and forest trees, for example, cereals (such as maize, wheat, rice, sorghum), cotton, tobacco, vegetables and salads (such as beans, coie crops, curcurbits, lettuce, onions, tomatoes and peppers), field crops (such as potato, sugar beet, ground nuts, soyabean, oil seed rape), sugarcane, grassland and forage (such as maize, sorghum, lucerne), plantations (such as of tea, coffee, cocoa, banana, cii palm, coconut, rubber, spices), orchards and groves (such as of stone and pip fruit, citrus, kiwrfruit. avocado, mango, olives, and walnuts), vineyarcs, ornamental plants, flowers and shrubs under glass and in gardens and parks, forest trees (both deciduous and evergreen) in forests, plantations and nurseries. They are also valuable in the protection of timber (standing, felled, converted, stored or structural) from atiack by sawflies (e.g. urocerus) or beetles (e.g. scciytids, platypodidst lyciids, bcstrychids, cerambycids, anobiids), or termites, for example, reticulitermes szz., ^eteroteimes spp., coptotermes.<br>
They have applications in the protection of stored products such as grains, bruits, nuts, spices arc zz~szzc. whether whole, miiled or compounded into prccucts. from moth, beetle and mite attack. Also protected are stored animal products such as skins, hair, wool and feathers in natural or converted form (e.g. as carpets or textiles) from moth and beetle attack; also stored meat and fish from beetle, mite and fly attack.<br><br>
