				<td>NOVEL PACLITAXEL DERIVATIVES FOR THE TREATMENT OF<br>
CANCER<br>
Field of Invention<br>
The invention relates to novel paclitaxel derivatives useful in the treatment of cancer. More specifically, the invention relates to paclitaxel derivatives obtained by substitutions at the C2', C3&gt; and/or C7 positions. The invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions containing the said derivatives and useful in the treatment of cancer affecting the lung, breast, ovary, cervix, etc. Further, the invention provides methods for the preparation of such novel paclitaxel derivatives.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Paclitaxel is a diterpenoid taxane derivative from the bark of Pacific yew, Taxus brevifolia. It was first discovered in 1971 following investigation of bark extracts from the European yew tree, Taxus baccata. Paclitaxel was randomly isolated and found to exhibit cytotoxic properties. The basic structure of paclitaxel is as depicted in Fig. 1. The central backbone unit of paclitaxel contains Baccatin III. Although Paclitaxel is structurally similar to vinca alkaloids, its mechanism of action is unique. It promotes the microtubule assembly by enhancing the action of tubulin dimers, stabilizing existing microtubules, and inhibiting their disassembly. Paclitaxel was originally approved for the treatment of refractory ovarian cancer and was subsequently approved for the use in breast carcinoma. It has also been used alone or as an adjunct therapy in other malignancies such as advanced head and neck cancer, metastatic breast cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer, acute leukemia, and melanoma.<br>
Since paclitaxel shows great promise as a chemotherapeutic agent, several researchers have spent substantial time in developing potent derivatives of paclitaxel. Attachment of the C-13 side chain of paclitaxel to other naturally occurring taxanes and taxoids,<br>
modification of the diterpene moiety of paclitaxel at various centers such as7-hydroxyl group, 10-hydroxyl group and modifications at C-2, 9, 19, 6 and 4 positions have been well documented. Other approaches have been modification at the C-13 side chain of paclitaxel, and in recent times, the development of water-soluble paclitaxel prodrugs.<br>
Modifications at the diterpene moiety as well as the C-13 side chain of paclitaxel has resulted in several derivatives of paclitaxel which have shown varying cytotoxic activities on human tumor cell lines in in vitro assays. In the diterpene moiety of paclitaxel, the 4-acetyl group and the 2-benzoyloxy moiety of paclitaxel are essential structures for cytotoxicity. Modifications of the A-ring and B-ring did not affect microtubule binding in a significant way. The acetoxy group at C-10 can be deleted while esterification of the C-10 hydroxyl group with a variety of acids provided active compounds. Of all the modifications made on the diterpene portion of the molecule, most of the initial structural changes have involved the derivatisation of the 7-hydroxyl group. The 7-hydroxyl group can be modified or epimerized without significant loss of bioactivity. Examples include 7-acetyltaxol, 7-benzoyltaxol, 7-glutaryl derivatives, and C-7 amino acid esters. Modifications at C-19 may be tolerated without significant loss of bioactivity.<br>
Most of the C-13 simplified paclitaxel derivatives and derivatives of different stereochemistry demonstrated reduced activity in comparison to paclitaxel. The 2'-hydroxyl and the 3'-benzamido group are not essential for bioactivity, but are important for strong microtubule binding and cytotoxicity. Formation of ethers at 2'-hydroxyl group, such as methyl ether and ter-butyldimethylsilyl ether, reduced cytotoxicity. Acetylation of the 2'-hydroxyl group (2'-acetyltaxol) also leads to loss of activity. Replacement of 2'-hydroxyl group by fluorine was also found to significantly reduce the cytotoxicity.<br>
A problem associated with the systemic administration of Paclitaxel is its low solubility in most pharmaceutically acceptable solvents. Most formulations used clinically contain Cremophor EL (polyethoxylated castor oil) and ethanol as excipients, which may cause hypersensitivity reactions. This can be prevented by pre-medication with certain antihistaminic drugs. To eliminate this vehicle and possibly reduce the dose and hence toxicity of paclitaxel, several approaches of drug targeting are currently being worked upon. Much work is being done on formulation of paclitaxel in liposomes of various compositions. Paclitaxel-liposomes retain the growth-inhibitory activity of the free drug in vitro against a variety of tumor cell lines. In mice, paclitaxel-liposomes were well-tolerated when given in bolus doses (Sharma A., et al, Pharm Res : 11, 1994). The Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) was &gt; 200 mg/kg which exceeded that of free paclitaxel (MTD of 30 mg/kg by iv or 50 mg/kg by ip administration). Free paclitaxel administered in the Cremophor vehicle was toxic at doses &gt; 30 mg/kg, as was the equivalent volume of vehicle without drug. However, the low stability of these formulations is still an area of concern. Some of these formulations are physically and chemically stable for only 2 months at 4 degrees C, or for 1 month at 20 degrees C.<br>
Yet another approach of tumor targeting is the administration of paclitaxel-loaded poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) microspheres containing isopropyl myristate (Paclitaxel-IPM-PLGA-MS). After administration of the drug saline solution, paclitaxel disappears rapidly from plasma and distributes extensively in various tissues. The tissue levels of paclitaxel in the lung were found to be higher than those in plasma but relatively lower than those in kidneys, bile, and liver (Sato H. et al, Biol Pharm Bull : 19, 1996). The biodistribution of paclitaxel after administration of Paclitaxel-IPM-PLGA-MS (3 mg paclitaxel/kg), on the other hand, was altered significantly from the control (paclitaxel solution) group. Paclitaxel concentrations in the lung were increased significantly with the microsphere group. It was also noticed that the paclitaxel levels in the lung were maintained at relatively high levels. Thus, it may be possible to use Paclitaxel-IPM-<br>
PLGA-MS for targeted delivery of paclitaxel to the lung. It however remains to be seen if this strategy can be used for targeting paclitaxel to tumors other than lung.<br>
Enzyme-activatable prodrugs in conjunction with antibody-enzyme fusion proteins offer an alternative to enhance the anti-tumor efficacy of antibodies and reduce the toxic side effects of conventional chemotherapeutics. Cephalosporins have proven to be highly versatile triggers for the enzymatic activation of such prodrugs. A cephem prodrug of paclitaxel (PROTAX) was synthesized by substituting the C-3' position of cephalothin with 2'-(gamma-aminobutyryl) paclitaxel (Rodrigues M.L., et al, Chem Biol : 2, 1995). Hydrolysis of PROTAX by beta-lactamase rapidly releases 2'-(gamma-aminobutyryl) which yields paclitaxel following intramolecular displacement. PROTAX is inactive in a microtubule assembly assay in vitro but has similar activity to paclitaxel following prolonged activation with beta-lactamase. PROTAX is approximately 10-fold less toxic than paclitaxel against SK-BR-3 breast tumor cells in vitro but has activity approaching that of paclitaxel following prolonged activation with a fusion protein comprising beta-lactamase fused to a tumor-targeting antibody fragment. Tubulin polymerization activity is abolished and cytotoxicity is reduced in the PROTAX prodrug compared to paclitaxel.<br>
Li. C., et al have recently reported in Cancer Research, 1998, p.2404, that a water soluble poly (L-glutamic acid)-paclitaxel (PG-TXL) conjugate produces striking antitumor effects with diminished toxicity. A single intravenous injection of PG-TXL of 40 mg paclitaxel / kg resulted in the disappearance of an established implanted 13762F mammary adenocarcinoma. PG-TXL has a prolonged half-life in plasma and a greater uptake in tumor as compared with paclitaxel.<br>

In the drawings that accompany<br>
Fig. 1 represents the structural formula of Paclitaxel.<br>
Fig. 2 represents the structural formula of paclitaxel analogues of the invention.<br>
Fig. 3 represents the structural formula of preferred paclitaxel analogues of the invention.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
As mentioned in the foregoing sections, Baccatin III forms the basic structural unit of paclitaxel. Typically, novel analogues are developed without disturbing the basic structure of paclitaxel so that the most potent and effective cytotoxic compounds are obtained.<br>
The applicants have found that substitutions at C?, C3- and C? positions of paclitaxel yield acyl, benzoyl, amino acid and peptide analogues which exhibit greater cytotoxicity than paclitaxel. According to the invention, the paclitaxel analogues thus obtained are represented by the general formula as shown in figure 2 of the accompanying drawings. The analogues thus formed are useful in the treatment of leukemia, ovary, breast, lung and cervical cancer.<br>
In particular, the applicants have observed that the C?, position of paclitaxel are quite reactive and the site can be utilized to develop useful and potent paclitaxel analogues. Condensation and other reactions at this site have produced several amino acid, benzoyl, acyl, thioaryl, protected and unprotected amino acid and peptide analogues and their salts. Some examples of such analogues are represented in the description of Figure 2 that follows.<br>
In addition, the applicants observed that the C7 amino function is also very reactive and acylation benzoylation or sulphonation at this site results in novel amide or sulphonamide derivatives respectively as represented in Figure 2.<br>

i)        treating the substrate (having C3 amino group) in ethylacetate and saturated<br>
aqueous solution of sodium bicarbonate with suitable sulphonyl chloride for<br>
6hr-24hr at ambient temperature.<br>
ii)       separating the organic layers and washing the organic layer with water, iii)       drying the organic layer over sodium sulphate and evaporating the solvent<br>
purifying the residue obtained by column chromatography to yield pure C3--<br>
sulphonamide derivative.<br>
In vitro cytotoxicity assay<br>
In vitro cytotoxic activity of novel paclitaxel derivatives was determined by performing the MTT cytotoxicity assay (Mosmann T., J Immunological Methods, 65 : 55 ; 1983). Briefly, the cultured tumor cells were separately seeded in a 96-well culture plate and<br>
co-incubated with paclitaxel or its derivatives dissolved in methanol, dimethyl formamide, dimethyl sulfoxide or isopropyl alcohol with relevant controls at 37°C in a CO2 incubator. After 24 to 96 hours, the assay was terminated and percent cyotoxicities calculated. Table II shows anticancer potency of paclitaxel derivatives over paclitaxel in leukemia cells (MOLT-4), ovarian cancer cells (PA-1), breast cancer cells (HBL100), lung cancer cells (L132) and cervical cancer cells (SiHa).<br>
