				<td>The present finding relates to a crown sizer according to the general part in claim I.<br>
The use of crown sizers is well known in many sectors, in particular in retail sales domains, for application on products in order to identify them.<br>
In current state of the art, crown sizers of known type present the problem of being easy to detach from their positioning seat.<br>
Such easy removal involves the risk of having objects lacking crown sizer, as well as the ease with which certain goods can be exchanged with others by ill-intentioned persons during warehouse stock management or in the stores where said goods are on sale, a fact that is more possible in particular when the crown sizer is applied to clothes hangers in general, for garment size identification marking.<br>
Moreover, since the clothes hangers are normally present in domestic environments, the danger exists in that if the crown sizers are easily detachable, they are attractive to children as play objects, and because of their reduced size and bright colour, they could be mistaken for a candy and therefore the danger exists that they could be swallowed.<br>
In order to prevent any negative possibilities, crown sizers have been realised which are assembled integral to the support, therefore making it very difficult to detach and remove them, but also thus compromising the entirety of the support, to the point of making re-use impossible.<br>
The object of the present finding is to realise a crown sizer of the type per se known that is assembled by inserting it on the hook and that it is then co-axially positioned with the pawl protruding from the arched structure of the clothes<br>
 <br>
hanger and which forms the reinforcing base of the hook itself, said hanger thus resulting free of the problems described above.<br>
Such object is achieved, according to the finding, by means of a crown sizer composed of an encasing structure in a prismatic form, with both bases open, respectively, the lower base in order to receive the pawl at the base of the hook, and the upper base for passing the hook itself therethrough, said crown sizer being characterised in that the interior is configured with one or more elastic protrusions which during the operational stage, penetrate inside the pawl of the hook or arched structure in order to realise a clip attachment with said crown sizer.<br>
The finding will be made clearer through the description of some of its possible embodiments, provided only by way of non-limiting example, with the help of the appended drawing tables wherein:<br>
Figure 1 represents a perspective view of a hanger in operational stage;<br>
Figures 2 to 4 represent the hanger provided with three different types of crown sizer according to the finding;<br>
Figures 5 and 6 represent two views, perspective and cross-sectioned, respectively, of a first embodiment of the crown sizer according to the finding;<br>
Figures 7 and 8 represent two views in detail of the crown sizer according to figure 5 in operational stage;<br>

-	Figures 21 to 23 represent the cross-sectioned views,<br>
respectively perspective, front and side views of a<br>
fifth embodiment of the crown sizer according to the<br>
finding;<br>
Figures 24 to 26 represent the cross-sectioned views, respectively front and side views of the crown sizer according to figure 21 in operational stage;<br>
-	Figures 27 to 29 represent the views  respectively<br>
perspective, front and side views of a first rotation-<br>
proof form of the crown sizer;<br>
-	Figures 30 to 32 represent the views  respectively<br>
perspective, front and side views of a second rotation-<br>
proof form of the crown sizer.<br>
As can be seen in figure 1, the crown sizer 1 is positioned at the base of the hook 2 after it has been passed through<br>
 <br>
the hook itself, in a manner so that it encases the pawl 3 that protrudes from the arched structure 4 of the clothes hanger, where it acts as a size identification marker.<br>
As can be seen in figures 5 to 8 in a first embodiment of the finding, the crown sizer 1 is attached directly on the pawl 3 by means of two teeth 5 opposite each other, present inside the encasing structure of the crown sizer itself, and positioned in a manner so that in operational stage, said teeth are inserted inside two corresponding slots 6 cut into the pawl itself.<br>
As can be seen in figures 9 to 12, a second embodiment of the finding is adapted for clothes hangers where the pawl 3 is equipped on both sides with reinforcing fins 7, so that the crown sizer 1 is attached to the sides of the pawl itself, by means of one or more teeth 8, present inside the encasing structure of the crown sizer and positioned in a manner so that in operational stage, said teeth are inserted under said fins.<br>
As can be seen in figures 13 to 15 in a third embodiment of the finding, the crown sizer 1 is attached to the arched structure 4 of the hanger, by means of one or more flexible tangs 9, obtained inside the encasing structure of the crown sizer itself, and which protrude slightly from the lower base so that in operational stage, the toothed ends 10 of the tangs are inserted inside corresponding seats 10.1 cut on the neck of said arched structure and positioned on each side of the pawl 3.<br>
As can be seen in figures 16 to 18 in a fourth embodiment of the finding, it is foreseen that the two fins 11 that form the upper open wall of the crown sizer, are equipped at the<br>
 <br>
sides with recesses 12, which separate said fins from the rest of the encasing structure, making it more flexible and thus easier to insert and position the crown sizer 1 on pawl 3.<br>
Again in the aforesaid fourth embodiment, it is foreseen that the teeth 5 opposite each other, present inside the encasing structure of the crown sizer itself, and which during the operational stage are inserted inside two corresponding slots 6 cut on the pawl 3, are positioned at the edge of the upper open wall. This constructive solution permits the attachment zone between the tooth 5 and the corresponding slot 6 to be positioned near the upper part of the pawl 3, and therefore advantageously, said zone results sufficiently distanced from the portion of the pawl in which the terminal part or "nail" 13 of hook 2 is embedded (see figure 20), and therefore said zone is not subject to deformation during the insertion stage of the hook in the pawl itself.<br>
Moreover, as can be seen in the detail view of figure 20, the finding foresees at the attachment zone of tooth 5, that the diameter of the hole on the pawl 3 is larger than the diameter of the hook 2, in order to create a channel "K" that extends under said attachment zone and that causes the reduction of the thickness of-the neck 3.1 so that when the nail 13 of the hook 2 is passed therethrough, it does not deform the aforesaid portion 3.1 and the relative slot seat 6.<br>
Moreover, as can be seen in the detail view of figure 20, the tooth 5 presents a spire-shaped section where the vertex is defined by two sloping planes in relation to the horizontal plane, in order to facilitate both the attachment and detachment stages in the slot seat 6, when the size-marker<br>
 <br>
wedge clamp needs to be removed from the hanger, for example, for recycling.<br>
In particular, as can be seen in the detailed view in figure 20, the surfaces of the tooth 5 and of the pawl 6, respectively 5.1, and 6.1, which during operational stage result as facing each other mutually, are set in a sloping position so that by varying the angle, it is possible to increase or reduce the force required to remove the crown sizer and this possibility is particularly important to guarantee protection against tampering on the part of small children.<br>
Furthermore, as can be seen in the detailed view in figure 19, in order to facilitate the attachment between tooth 5 and seat 6, it is foreseen that as well as its normal closed profile, the aforesaid seat 6 can also be configured open on one side 6.1, or configured open on both sides 6.2, in order to receive teeth of varying widths of any type.<br>
Moreover, in order to simplify the insertion of the crown sizer 1 on the pawl 3, it is foreseen that the upper portion 3.2 of the pawl is configured in a slightly wedge-shaped form, by the creation of sloping surfaces 14, on which the teeth 5 are engaged in a sliding action.<br>
As can be seen in the figures 21 to 23 in a fifth embodiment of the finding, it is foreseen that the clip attachment between the crown sizer 1 and the pawl 3 is realised by means of the upper fins 11 of the crown sizer which are engaged in the operational stage on corresponding slots 15 cut on the pawl itself.<br>
Specifically, as can be seen in figure 24, the slots 15 are positioned in front of the fins 11 and are arranged rotated<br>
 <br>
by 90° in relation to the slots 6 described previously (See Fig. 19).<br>
Moreover, to simplify the insertion of crown sizer 1 on the pawl 3, also in this further embodiment, the upper portion 3.2 of pawl 3 is equipped with sloping surfaces 16 on which the ends of the fins 11 are engaged to slide before they are fitted in the corresponding slots 15.<br>
As can be seen in figures 27 and 30, in order to facilitate the positioning and centring of the crown sizer, it is foreseen that at least one side wall 17 has been formed on the pawl 3, which during the operational stage, moves into contact with the internal part "T" of the crown sizer 1 and therefore prevents a mutual rotation of the pawl/crown sizer around the UZ" axis of hook 2.<br>
From the construction aspect, as can be seen in figures from 27 to 29, on the hangers where the pawl 3 is combined with a side reinforcing tang 7 (See Fig. 3.1) the centring action of the crown sizer is obtained by foreseeing that the aforesaid tang has a width at least equal to the width of the pawl itself, in order to realise walls 17.1, that form a frontal contact zone, acting as a guide and rotation-proof element for the aforesaid crown sizer.<br>
Alternatively, as can be seen in figures 30 to 32, on the hangers with an "inverted . "U" shaped section, wherein the pawl 3 is basically a substantially cylindrical element, the centring action of the crown sizer is obtained by realising side walls 17.2, which prevent crown sizer 1 from rotating.<br>
Naturally other different embodiments can be realised for crown sizers based on the prismatic configuration of the<br>
 <br>
crown sizer and the type of support, however, these remain within the context of the claims defined below.<br>
