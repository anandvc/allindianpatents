				<td>ANTISEPTIC MATERIAL AND A METHOD FOR THE PRODUCTION AND USE<br>
THEREOF<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to chemical industry and in particular to a substance having<br>
antiseptic properties, as well as to a method for production and use thereof. The invention may<br>
be used as a filtering material or an additive to the mixture of filtering materials or a component<br>
of filtering composite materials for disinfection and purification of liquids, preferably drinking<br>
water, or gases.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
From the U.S. Patent No. 4,594,392, there is known a stable combined form of<br>
halogenated and/or interhalogenated resins for disinfection of water, comprising a copolymer in<br>
the form A/B-X, wherein X includes polyvinylpyridine, having functional pyridyl group C5H5N,<br>
being cross-linked with approximately 2-25% of divinylbenzene, wherein A/B is a combination<br>
of halogens and/or interhalogens, attached to the nitrogen atom of the functional pyridil group X.<br>
The process of obtaining such material comprises processing with halogenides and, or<br>
interhalogenides solution in methanol, methyl chloride or chloroform and further washing of the<br>
obtained material with water.<br>
Use of poisonous and expensive components in the process of production of the Said<br>
polymer material not only complicates the process itself but also increases the net cost of the<br>
final product, while the obtained polymer material for water disinfection evolves into this water<br>
iodine and bromine which are extremely poisonous. Iodine excess leads to thyroid gland diseases<br>
while that of bromine leads to the nervous system diseases.<br>
The closest analogue (prototype) of the present invention is a solid water-insoluble cross-<br>
linked polymer material selected from the group comprising urea-formaldehyde, melamine-<br>
formaldehyde, urea-melamine-formaldehyde resins, described in the Canadian Patent<br>
No. 849 614, comprising chlorine atoms reversibly bound with nitrogen atoms and containing no<br>
less than 1 % of chlorine by weight.<br>
The described polymer material contains weak bonds between nitrogen and chlorine<br>
atoms and easily yields chlorine into the environment, thus it can be used for disinfection of<br>
different sources of water. This material is obtained by passing at room temperature of gasecus<br>
chlorine through aqueous suspension of cross-linked polymer resin, selected from the group<br>
comprising urea-formaldehyde, melamine-formaldehyde, urea-melamine-formaldehyde resins.<br>
A disadvantage of such material is that it cannot retain chlorine. In storage, such material<br>
self-oxidizes and deteriorates. The process of producing such material needs additional<br>
components and stages during chlorination, which complicates the method of production,<br>
increases power consumption and eventually increases the net costs of the product. In order to<br>
make the product water-insoluble, there is a need for a cross-linkage stage, which, in case<br>
melamine-formaldehyde resin is used, takes place in the presence of the additional component<br>
such as monohydrate glyoxal, which is poisonous. The process of producing urea-melamine-<br>
formaldehyde resin is multistage, needs additional ingredients and is time-consuming. Cross-<br>
linkage of urea-formaldehyde resin takes a long time, about 17 hours. Such use of above-<br>
described resins for producing chlorinated polymer material is associated with a complicated and<br>
time-consuming process of the producing the resin itself, which leads to increased power<br>
consumption while usage of free chlorine atom at the stage of chlorination reduces ecological<br>
compatibility.<br>
A further development of the invention described in the Canadian Patent No. 849 614 is a<br>
solid water-insoluble cross-linked polymer material described in the U.S. Patent No. 3,948,853, <br>
which comprises chlorine atoms reversibly bound with nitrogen atoms, the content of nitrogen<br>
being no less than 1% by weight, selected from the group, comprising a) urea-formaldehyde<br>
resin; b) melamine-formaldehyde resin; c) urea-melamine-formaldehyde resin; wherein in each<br>
case the resin is stabilized by chlorine dioxide or hypochlorite or by multiple chlorination. The<br>
inventors proposed a method for stabilization of polymer material to enhance of its resistance to<br>
self-oxidation. However, such method of producing a stabilized resin is even more complicated<br>
as compared to its prototype, as it comprises additional stages, namely exposure to hypochlorres<br>
and chlorine dioxide. Eventually these lead to greater power consumption and an increase in the<br>
net costs of the final product, while its resistance to self-oxidation does not improve<br>
significantly, approximately up to 3 months, which is not suitable for a long-term storage and<br>
long-distance shipment.<br>
There are known polymer cyclic biocidal compounds, comprising N-galamines<br>
(galamines meaning chlorine and bromine amines) described in the U.S. Patent No. 5,490,983.<br>
The inventors propose polymer cyclic biocidal compounds and methods of use thereof, wherein<br>
functional groups in such compounds, such as halogenated hydantoins, triazine diones or<br>
pyrimidinones are mixed with cheap polymer links such as polystyrene, polyethylene or<br>
modified polymethacrylamide ones. Said polymer compounds are stable and recyclable insoluble<br>
biocides, which yield only small amounts of free halogen and admixtures into the water. They<br>
can be used as disinfectants for drinking water, swimming pools, hot baths, industrial water<br>
supply systems, heating columns, air conditioning systems, gas flows, paints, oils, ointments,<br>
tissues, sterile dressings, coatings, solid surfaces, inserts and containers etc.<br>
Among their disadvantages there are high net costs and low ecological compatibility of<br>
the production process itself. Moreover, this process is complicated and is highly work- and<br>
power consuming, as expensive and poisonous components are used, namely acetylchloride and<br>
carbon disulphide, their vapors being dangerously explosive when contacting with air. Use of<br>
compounds that are dangerous for humans exerts an adverse effect on the environment at the<br>
place of production and in its vicinity.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
The objective resolved by the authors of the present invention consists in providing a<br>
stable antiseptic material capable of multiple regeneration, produced using a simple method and<br>
having low net costs, which can be used as a filtering material or an additive for the mixture of<br>
filtering materials, or as a component of filtering composites used for purification and<br>
disinfection of liquids, preferably drinking water, or gases. <br>
The technical effect of the present invention consists in the implementation of intended<br>
use of the proposed antiseptic material, reduced economical and power demands of its<br>
production, as well as in improved ecologic. compatibility and simplification of the process of its<br>
production.<br>
The technical effect is achieved by the following:<br>
An antiseptic material, which consists of a solid non-water soluble cross-linked polymer<br>
material, containing chlorine atoms reversibly bound with nitrogen atoms, according to the<br>
present invention has a general formula: M(F)1.0-5.5(Ph)0,6-1.0Cl-4.2, where M is melamine,<br>
F - bridge and terminal groups - formaldehyde derivatives, Ph - phosphorus with oxidation level<br>
+5, Cl - chlorine atoms bound with nitrogen atoms, wherein the above-mentioned material is<br>
cross-linked by binding phosphorus-containing ions with melamine links of polymer chaims,<br>
wherein said polymer material is a powder or granules or a mixture thereof, wherein granules are<br>
a porous material 0,1-4 mm in size, preferably 0,3-2 mm, which is resistant to self-oxidation, is<br>
capable of inactivation of microorganisms at immediate contact in liquid and gaseous<br>
environments, yields active chlorine into the liquid environment in the controlled concentration<br>
no less than 0,01 mg/1 but no more than 4 mg/1, preferably 0,1-1,5 mg/1, more preferably 0,2-0.4<br>
mg/1, which does not significantly depend on pH level or temperature of the environment, being<br>
safe for humans and sufficient for a long-term maintenance of the antiseptic effect of the<br>
environment; oxidizes reductants, e.g. arsenite, hydrogen sulfide, ferrous iron. A method of<br>
producing the inventive antiseptic material includes chlorinating solid non-water soluble cross-<br>
linked polymer material and uses a product, which is produced by condensation of melamine<br>
phosphate and paraform or soluble non-organic phosphate, melamine and paraform in an<br>
aqueous solution, wherein the above-mentioned material is cross-linked by binding the<br>
phosphorus-containing ions with melamine links of polymer chains immediately in the process<br>
of obtaining said product, whereas an aqueous solution of hypochlorites of alkaline metals is<br>
used as a chlorinating agent, e.g. those of sodium, potassium, lithium or alkali-earth metals, or<br>
example that of calcium. Use of the antiseptic material, consisting of a solid water-insoluble<br>
cross-linked polymer material, which comprises chlorine atoms reversibly bound with nitrogen<br>
atoms and has the following general formula: M(F)1.0-5.5(Ph)0,6-1.0Cl-4.2, where M is<br>
melamine, F - bridge and terminal groups - formaldehyde derivatives, Ph - phosphorus with<br>
oxidation level +5, CI - chlorine atoms bound with nitrogen atoms, wherein the above-mentioned<br>
material is cross-linked by binding phosphorus-containing ions with melamine links of polymer<br>
chains as a filtering material, as an additive to the mixture of filtering materials or component of<br>
the filtering composites for disinfection and purification of liquids or gases.<br>
The antiseptic material is obtained as follows: <br>
A mixture of melamine phosphate, water and paraform or soluble non-organic phosphate,<br>
melamine, water and paraform is heated while being stirred. Consequently, depending on the<br>
• conditions of stirring, a product is obtained in the form of powder or granules or mixture thereof,<br>
wherein granules are of a porous material, in particular a hydrophilic one, 0,1-4 mm in she,<br>
preferably 0,3-2 mm. Then the reaction liquid is removed, the product is washed with water and<br>
treated at the room temperature with a water solution of hypochlorites of alkaline metals, for<br>
example those of sodium, potassium, lithium, or alkali-earth metals, for example that of calcium.<br>
The obtained material disinfects liquid being run through it, annihilates bacteria and viruses and<br>
may be used as a filtering material for purification of liquids, for example drinking water,<br>
swimming pool water, waste water, process liquids; it may be also used as a component of<br>
filtering composites. It can be deposited on fibers, films, granules and other solid carriers; this<br>
can be done immediately during the process of polymerization in order to achieve a synergeric<br>
effect or for more convenient usage.<br>
The antiseptic material is characterized as follows:<br>
• due to the balanced hydrolysis, it yields active chlorine into the running water in a<br>
controllable concentration of no less than 0,01 mg/1, but no more than 4mg/l, preferably 0.1<br>
- 1,5 mg/1, more preferably 0,2 - 0,4 mg/1. A low concentration of the yielded active<br>
chlorine is safe for human health, maintains the biocidal properties of the disinfected liquid<br>
in further storage and prevents the formation of chlorinated organic compounds which<br>
easily emerge in case of water chlorination with gaseous chlorine and are poisonous;<br>
• it oxidizes reductants, namely arsenites, hydrogen sulfide, ferrous iron salts, transforming<br>
them into harmless substances;<br>
• is highly resistant to self-oxidation;<br>
• is capable of effective inactivation of microorganisms at immediate contact in a liquid or<br>
gaseous environment;<br>
• concentration of active chlorine yielded into the liquid environment by said material does<br>
not significantly depend on pH level and temperature of the environment.<br>
As compared to the prototype, no additional steps of cross-linking or usage of any toxic<br>
linking agent are necessary for obtaining the material according to the present invention. Cross-<br>
linking is achieved by binding phosphorus-containing ions with melamine links of polymer<br>
chains immediately in the process of producing the polymer material. Usage of hypochlorites in<br>
the production of the antiseptic material improves the ecological compatibility of the production<br>
method. Fast saturation with active chlorine approximately up to 90-95% during the first hour of<br>
chlorination according to the proposed method of production of the antiseptic material reduces<br>
power consumption and increases the efficiency of said method. <br>
Regeneration of the antiseptic material after depletion may be performed by passing a<br>
water solution of hypochlorites of alkaline metals or alkali-earth metals through the material,<br>
wherein such regeneration may be performed in the running mode.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Examples of obtaining the antiseptic material:<br>
Example 1<br>

iodometrically).<br>
Example 2<br>
12,6 g of melamine, 7,5 g of paraform and 21,0 g of sodium dihydrogen phosphate<br>
dihydrate were put into a round-bottom flask (200 ml) with a mechanical stirrer, then 100 ml of<br>
water were added. The mixture was actively stirred (1200 rpm) at 90°C for 4 hours. The obtained<br>
product was porous, in the form of granules 0,3-2 mm in size. The mass of the obtained product<br>
was 29,2 g.<br>
Mole ratio of the components is the same as in Example 1.<br>
The granules were washed with water using a Buchner funnel.<br>
The obtained polymer was chlorinated while stirring for 1 hour with 300 ml of sodium<br>
hypochloride with active chlorine concentration of 52 g/l.<br>
The chlorinated product was washed with water using a Buchner funnel up to neutral<br>
reaction, and then was dried at 50°C.<br>
The product comprised 28% of active chlorine (the chlorine content was assessed<br>
iodimetrically).<br>
Example 3<br>
The polymer material was obtained by the method described in Example 1.<br>
The obtained product was chlorinated while being mixed with an aqueous suspension of<br>
chloride lime (80 g of CaCl(OCl)) and retained for 5 hours.<br>
The chlorinated product was washed with acid (100 ml of 10% solution) and water using<br>
a Buchner funnel, then dried at 50°C.<br>
There was obtained a product containing 26% of active chlorine.<br>
Examples confirming the properties and implementation of the intended use of the<br>
antiseptic material:<br>
Example 4<br>
Through the funnel 2 cm in diameter and 10 cm in length, containing 50 g of the product<br>
obtained in Examples 1-3 (hereinafter referred to as "the funnel") distilled water was poured<br>
with different initial pH levels at a rate of 0,1 1/minute at 25°C.<br>
pH level of the poured water was set by adding sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid.<br>
In the outgoing water, active chlorine concentration was iodometrically estimated<br>
(titration with sodium thiosulfate). The following correlation of the chlorine concentration with<br>
poured water volume was registered:<br>
Example 5<br>
Distilled water with initial pH level 7,5 was poured through the funnel at a rate of 0.1<br>
1/minute at 5°C and 45°C. The following correlation of the chlorine concentration with poured<br>
water volume was registered:<br>
Example 6<br>
A suspension of E. Coli bacteria in concentration of 10000 cells/ml was poured through<br>
the funnel at a rate of 0,1 1/min at 25°C. Output bacteria concentration was estimated in every 20<br>
liters using the method of plating with peptone agar. Output concentration of the bacterial cells<br>
was as follows:<br>
Thus, for this mode of pouring the resource for E. Coli was 3200 1 of water per 1 kg of<br>
the product.<br>
Example 7<br>
A suspension of Bacillus subtilis cells was poured through the funnel in the same<br>
conditions as in Example 6. Output concentration of the bacterial cells was as follows:<br>
Thus, for this mode of pouring the resource for Bacillus subtilis was 4400 1 of water per 1<br>
kg of the product.<br>
Example 8<br>
A suspension of viruses (bacteriophages) MS-2 with a concentration of viral partices<br>
being 105/ml was poured through the funnel in the same conditions as in Example 6. Output<br>
concentration of the viral particles was as follows:<br>
Thus, for this mode of pouring the resource for MS-2 was 1400 1 of water per 1 kg of the<br>
product.<br>
Examples 6, 7 and 8 confirm the antibacterial and antiviral activity of the proposed<br>
material.<br>
Example 9<br>
100 ml of E. Coli suspension with concentration of 1000 cells/ml were stirred for one<br>
hour using a magnetic stirrer with 2 g of the substance obtained in Example 1.<br>
In the control experiment 2 g of the product were stirred for one hour with 100 ml of<br>
distilled water, then water was separated by filtration with a paper filter. The concentration of the<br>
active chlorine in this water was 384 µg/1. Further, 1 ml of E. Coli suspension with concentration<br>
of 105 cells/ml was added into this water, then the mixture was stirred for one hour.<br>
The solution obtained in the first experiment turned out to be sterile. The concentration of<br>
the live cells in the second solution was 72 CFU/ml (average of the three iterations).<br>
Thus, the antibacterial activity of the proposed material is significantly higher than that of<br>
the active chlorine being balanced with it.<br>
Example 9 confirms the capability of the proposed antiseptic material to inactivate<br>
microorganisms on immediate contact.<br>
Example 10<br>
In the same conditions as in Example 6, a Mohr's salt solution with Fe2+concentration of<br>
50 mg/1 was poured through the funnel. A decrease in the output concentration of ferrous iron<br>
was registered (due to its oxidation into the ferric iron).<br>
Example 11<br>
In the same conditions as in Example 6, a Mohr's salt solution with As3+ in concentration<br>
of 10 mg/1 was poured through the funnel. A decrease in the output concentration of trivalent<br>
arsenic was registered (due to its oxidation into pentavalent arsenic).<br>
Example 12<br>
In the same conditions as in Example 6, hydrogen sulfide solution with S2- concentration<br>
of 10 mg/1 was poured through the funnel. A decrease in the output concentration of bivalent<br>
sulfur and its conversion into sulfate-ions was registered.<br>
Examples 10, 11, 12 confirm the capability of the proposed antiseptic substance to<br>
oxidize reductants, converting them into safe substances.<br>
Example 13<br>
Experimental studies of the antiseptic material resistance to self-oxidation were carried<br>
out. The chlorine content in the product in the initial concentration of 20% by weight decreases<br>
to 19,2% by weight when the product is stored for 8 moths at a room temperature away from<br>
moisture, and to 17% when the product is stored for 8 months at a room temperature under<br>
water.<br>

The invention relates to chemical industry, in particular to a substance with antiseptic<br>
properties and to a method for obtaining and use thereof. The inventive substance can be used as<br>
a filtering material or an additive for the mixture of filtering materials, or as a component of<br>
filtering composites used for disinfection and purification of liquids, preferably drinking water,<br>
or gases. The inventive antiseptic material consists of a solid non-water soluble cross-linked<br>
polymer material, which comprises chlorine atoms reversibly bound with nitrogen atoms and is<br>
characterized by the following general formula: M(F)1.0-5.5(Ph)0.6-1.0Cl-4.2, where M is<br>
melamine, F - bridge and terminal groups - formaldehyde derivatives, Ph - phosphorus with<br>
oxidation level +5, Cl - chlorine atoms bound with nitrogen atoms, wherein the above-<br>
mentioned material is cross-linked by binding phosphorus-containing ions with melamine links<br>
of polymer chains. The inventive method for obtaining an antiseptic material includes<br>
chlorinating a solid non-water soluble cross-linked polymer material which is obtained by<br>
condensation of melamine phosphate and paraform in an aqueous solution, wherein the above-<br>
mentioned polymer material is cross-linked by binding the phosphorus-containing ions with the<br>
melamine links of polymer chains immediately in the process of obtaining said product.</td>
