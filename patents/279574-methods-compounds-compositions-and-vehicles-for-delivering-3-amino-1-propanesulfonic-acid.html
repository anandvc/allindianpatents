Related Application<br>
This application claims priority from U.S. provisional patent application no. US 60/851,039 filed October 12, 2006, and U.S. provisional patent application no. US 60/911,459 filed April 12, 2007, which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to methods, compounds, compositions and vehicles for delivering 3-amino-1-propanesulfonic acid (3APS) in a subject, preferably a human subject. The invention encompasses compounds that will yield or generate 3APS, either in vitro or in vivo. Preferred compounds include amino acid prodrugs of SAPS for use, including but not limited to, the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive degenerative disease of the brain primarily associated with aging. Prevalence of AD in the United States in 2000 was close to 4.5 Million. It was estimated that about one in ten individuals over 65 and nearly half of those over 85 are affected by Alzheimer's disease. Approximately 360,000 patients will be diagnosed with AD each year in the United States alone.<br>
Clinical presentation of AD is characterized by loss of memory, cognition, reasoning, judgment, and orientation. As the disease progresses, motor, sensory, and linguistic abilities are also affected until there is global impairment of multiple cognitive functions. These cognitive losses occur gradually, but typically lead to severe impairment and eventual death in the range of four to twelve years.<br>
Alzheimer's disease is characterized by two major pathologic observations in the brain: neurofibrillary tangles and beta amyloid (or neuritic) plaques, comprised predominantly of an aggregate of a peptide fragment know as AB. Individuals with AD exhibit characteristic beta-amyloid deposits in the brain (beta amyloid plaques) and in cerebral blood vessels (beta amyloid angiopathy) as well as neurofibrillary tangles. Neurofibrillary tangles occur not only in Alzheimer's disease but also in other dementia-inducing disorders.<br>
3-amino-1-propanesulfonic acid (3APS, Tramiprosate, Alzhemed™) is a promising investigational product candidate for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease that is currently in Phase III clinical trials in North America and Europe (Wright, T. M., Drugs of Today (2006), 42(5): 291-298). This product is developed by Neurochem Inc. (Laval, QC, Canada) and it is<br>
believed to act by reducing the deposition and/or load of amyloid in the brain through its binding to soluble Aß peptide. For increasing the therapeutic effectiveness of 3APS, it would be desirable to increase bioavailability, stability and/or crossing the blood brain barrier of 3APS. These and other needs can be satisfied by the disclosure herein of a prodrug form of 3-amino-1-propanesulfonic acid (3APS), pharmaceutical compositions and uses thereof to treat various medical disorders.<br>
Previous metabolic stability studies had demonstrated that there was no in vitro metabolism of 3APS. Those studies include: 3APS metabolic stability in pooled human hepatocytes, human, rat and dog liver microsomes, human intestinal microflora, pooled human liver cytosol, and human arylamine N-acetyltransferase (See Examples 4 and 5).<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that 3APS is metabolized both in vitro and in vivo. Indeed, as described in more detail hereinafter, recent in vivo studies indicate extensive metabolism, particularly first-pass and/or systemic metabolism of 3APS. Three potential metabolites were identified from at least one type of biological species: 2-carboxyethanesulfonic acid, 3-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonic acid and 3-acetylamino-1-propanesulfonic acid. Further studies demonstrated that 2-carboxyethanesulfonic acid was the only major metabolite of 3APS in mice, rats, dogs and humans.<br>
(Formula Removed)Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is hypothesized that metabolism of 3APS is mainly caused by a transaminase and/or monoamine oxidase that generates 2-carboxyethanesulfonic acid as the main metabolite and 3-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonir; acid as a minor metabolite. N-acetyl-3-aminopropanesulfonic acid is another possible minor metabolite and it is believed to be produced by an enzyme that acetylates 3APS. These hypotheses are supported by in vitro experiments (see, for example, Example 5) showing<br>
that the conversion of 3APS to 2-carboxyethanesulfonic acid in primary neuron culture media was significantly inhibited by vigabatrin, a classic GABA transaminase inhibitor. Nialamide, a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, also reduced the formation of 2-carboxyethanesulfonic acid (from 3APS) but to a lesser extent.<br>
Accordingly, an aspect of the invention concerns compounds and compositions that can deliver 3APS by minimizing the metabolism, e.g., first-pass metabolism, associated with that drug, and more particularly compounds that would block or protect the amino group of 3APS such that it avoids metabolism, e.g., by transaminases and/or monoamine oxidases.<br>
The invention includes methods, compounds, compositions and vehicles for delivering in a subject, preferably a human subject, 3-amino-1-propanesulfonic acid, or salts thereof. 3-Amino-1-propanesulfonic acid (also named SAPS, Tramiprosate, Alzhemed™) has the structure:<br>
(Formula Removed)According to an aspect, the present invention relates to compounds or compositions that will yield or generate 3APS after administered in a subject. In one embodiment, the compound that will yield or generate 3APS is an amino acid prodrug of 3APS. In another embodiment, the compound that will yield or generate 3APS is a carbamate prodrug of 3APS. In another embodiment, the compound that will yield or generate 3APS is an amide prodrug of 3APS. In another embodiment, the compound that will yield or generate 3APS is a carbohydrate-derived prodrug of 3APS. In another embodiment, the compound that will yield or generate 3APS is a N-hydroxy prodrug. In another embodiment, the compound that will yield or generate 3APS is a cyclic double-protected prodrug. In further embodiment, the compound that yields or generates 3APS is a 3APS polymer (e.g. a molecule composed of two or more molecules of 3APS linked together). In further embodiment, the compound that yields or generates 3APS is a gemini dimer of 3APS. In certain embodiments, the amino acid prodrugs of 3APS that are capable of yielding or generating, either in vitro or in vivo, 3APS have one of the general or specific formulae or structures disclosed herein. The present invention encompasses these compounds, pharmaceutical compositions containing these compounds, and methods employing such compounds or compositions in the treatment of various medical disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.<br>

The present invention further relates to a method for increasing the therapeutic effectiveness of 3APS comprising administering to a subject, preferably a human subject, an effective amount of a prodrug of the present invention.<br>
The present invention also provides processes for converting compounds of the invention to 3APS. The conversion and/or generation of 3APS involves contacting any of the compounds of the invention, e.g., with blood, plasma and/or brain cells. The conversion can occur in vitro or in vivo. The conversion may also occur in the presence of enzymes capable of cleaving amine bonds, such as peptidases, or other enzymes appropriate for other structures herein, including those found in the blood, plasma and/or brain.<br>
The invention also provides the use of a compound according to the invention for the manufacture of a medicament. The invention also provides the use of a compound of the invention for the treatment or prevention of Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, Down's syndrome, Hereditary Cerebral Hemorrhage with Amyloidosis of the Dutch-Type, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, other degenerative dementias, dementias of mixed vascular and degenerative origin, dementia associated with Parkinson's disease, dementia associated with progressive supranuclear palsy, dementia associated with cortical basal degeneration, or diffuse Lewy body type of Alzheimer's disease. The invention also provides methods for the treatment or prevention of the aforementioned diseases comprising administration of a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention or a composition comprising the same, to a subject, preferably a human subject, in need thereof. More preferably, the disease is Alzheimer's disease. Accordingly, a related aspect of the invention relates to the prevention and/or treatment of Alzheimer's disease in a human subject by administering an effective amount of a compound or composition of the present invention to a human subject in need thereof.<br>

Additional objects, advantages and features of the present invention will become more apparent upon reading of the following non-restrictive description of preferred embodiments which are exemplary and should not be interpreted as limiting the scope of the invention.<br>
/. Definitions<br>
All technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one ordinary skilled in the art to which the invention pertains. For convenience, the meaning of certain terms and phrases used herein are provided below.<br>
To the extent the definitions of terms in the publications, patents, and patent applications incorporated herein by reference are contrary to the definitions set forth in this specification, the definitions in this specification control. The section headings used herein are for organizational purposes only, and are not to be construed as limiting the subject matter disclosed.<br>
It should be noted that, the singular forms "a", "an", and "the" include plural referents unless the content clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to a composition containing "a compound" includes a mixture of two or more compounds. It should also be noted that the term "or" is generally employed in its sense including "and/or" unless the content clearly dictates otherwise.<br>
The chemical structures herein are drawn according to the conventional standards known in the art. Thus, where an atom, such as a carbon atom, as drawn appears to have an unsatisfied valency, then that valency is assumed to be satisfied by a hydrogen atom even though that hydrogen atom is not necessarily explicitly drawn. Hydrogen atoms should be inferred to be part of the compound.<br>
The symbol "— " in general represents a bond between two atoms in the chain. Thus CH3— 0— CH2— CH(Rj) — CH3 represents a 2-substituted-1-methoxypropane compound. In addition, the symbol "— " represents the point of attachment of the substituent to a compound. Thus for example aryl(C1-C6)— alkyl indicates an arylalkyl group, such as benzyl, attached to the compound at the alkyl moiety.<br>
Where multiple substituents are indicated as being attached to a structure, it is to be understood that the substituents can be the same or different. Thus for example "Rrri optionally substituted with 1 , 2 or 3 Rq groups" indicates that Rm is substituted with 1 , 2, or 3 Rq groups where the Rq groups can be the same or different.<br>
As used herein, the term "Compounds of the present invention" and equivalent expressions refers to compounds mentioned herein as being useful for at least one purpose of the invention, e.g., those encompassed by structural Formulae such as (I), (I-A), (I-C), (I-D), (I-E), (I-P), (I-P2), (II), (III), (IV), (V), (VI), (VII), (VIII), (IX), (X), (XI), (XII), (XII-A) and (XIII), and includes specific compounds mentioned herein such as A1 to A35, C1 to C26, B1 to B14, H1 to H4, G1 to.G11, S1 to S14 and D1 to D8, etc., as well as their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and solvates. Embodiments herein may exclude one or more of the compounds of the invention. Compounds may be identified either by their chemical structure<br>
and/or chemical name. When the chemical structure and chemical name conflict, the chemical structure is determinative of the identity of the compound. The compounds described herein may contain one or more chiral centers and/or double bonds and therefore, may exist as stereo isomers, such as double-bond isomers (i.e., geometric isomers), enantiomers, or diastereomers. Accordingly, the chemical structures disclosed herein encompass all possible enantiomers and stereoisomers of the illustrated compounds including the stereoisomerically pure form (e.g., geometrically pure, enantiomerically pure, or diastereomerically pure) and enantiomeric and stereoisomeric mixtures. Enantiomeric and stereoisomeric mixtures can be resolved into their component enantiomers or stereoisomers using separation techniques or chiral synthesis techniques well known to the skilled artisan, e.g., chiral chromatography (such as chiral HPLC), immunoassay techniques, or the use of covalently (such as Mosher's esters) and non-covalently (such as chiral salts) bound chiral reagents to respectively form a diastereomeric mixture which can be separated by conventional methods, such as chromatography, distillation, crystallization or sublimation, the chiral salt or ester is then exchanged or cleaved by conventional means, to recover the desired isomers. The compounds may also exist in several tautomeric forms including the enol form, the keto form, and mixtures thereof. Accordingly, the chemical structures depicted herein encompass all possible tautomeric forms of the illustrated compounds. The disclosed compounds also include isotopically labeled compounds where one or more atoms have an atomic mass different from the atomic mass most abundantly found in nature. Examples of isotopes that may be incorporated into the compounds of the present invention include, but are not limited to, 2H (D), 3H (T), 11C, 13C, 14C, 16N, 18O, 17O, etc. Compounds may exist in unsolvated forms as well as solvated forms, including hydrated forms. In general, compounds may be hydrated or solvated. Certain compounds may exist in multiple crystalline or amorphous forms. In general, all physical forms are equivalent for the uses contemplated herein and are intended to be within the scope of the present invention. Further, when partial structures of the compounds are illustrated, brackets or equivalents indicate the point of attachment of the partial structure to the rest of the molecule.<br>
The term "prodrug" and equivalent expressions refer to agents which can be converted in vitro or in vivo directly or indirectly to an active form (see, e.g., R.B. Silverman, 1992, "The Organic Chemistry of Drug Design and Drug Action," Academic Press, Chap. 8; Bundgaard, Hans; Editor. Neth. (1985), "Design of Prodrugs". 360 pp. Elsevier, Amsterdam; Stella, V.; Borchardt, R.; Hageman, M.; Oliyai, R.; Maag, H.; Tilley, J. (Eds.) (2007), "Prodrugs: Challenges and Rewards, XVIII, 1470 p. Springer). Prodrugs can be used to alter the biodistribution (e.g., to allow agents which would not typically enter the reactive site of the protease) or the pharmacokinetics for a particular agent. A wide variety of groups have been used to modify compounds to form prodrugs, for example, esters, ethers, phosphates,<br>
etc. When the prodrug is administered to a subject, the group is cleaved, enzymatically or non-enzymatically, reductively, oxidatively, or hydrolytically, or otherwise to reveal the active form. As used herein, "prodrug" includes pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, or pharmaceutically acceptable solvates as well as crystalline forms of any of the foregoing. Prodrugs are frequently, although not necessarily, pharmacologically inactive until converted to the parent drug.<br>
The term "gemini dimer" and equivalent expressions refer to a synthetic compound comprising at least two moieties of the same agent or drug coupled together. For background on gemini dimers, see: Hammell D C, Hamad M, Vaddi H K, Crooks P A, Stinchcomb A L. A duplex "Gemini" prodrug of naltrexone for transdermal delivery. J Control Release. 2004. 97(2):283-90. In preferred embodiment, the gemini dimers of the invention are made of two linked SAPS molecules that may be converted in vitro or in vivo directly or indirectly to release at least one, preferably two, pharmaceutically active 3APS molecules.<br>
The term "carbamate" refers to an oxycarbonyl residue (-OC(O)-) linked to an amino group to form a group comprising a (-OC(O)N(or NH)-) radical The carbamate group can be secondary (NH) or tertiary (N). This term is further defined in Section Il-B(a).<br>
The term "amide" refers to an organic compound containing a carbonyl (-C(O)-) attached to an amine group to form a group comprising the radical (-C(O)N(or NH)-). The amide group can be secondary (NH) or tertiary (N). This term is further defined in Section II-A. The term "non-amino acid amide" refers to an amide group where the carbonyl (-C(O)-) does not form part of an amino acid residue. This term is further defined in Section Il-B(b).<br>

In a further aspect the invention includes the administration of 3APS that is not via a transdermal patch, or not by topical administration in a composition, e.g., lotions, creams, solutions, gels or solids or not by subcutaneous, intravenous or intraperitoneal injection, or not intraspinally, or intracerebrally.<br>
//. Compounds of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to methods, compounds and compositions for delivering in a subject, preferably a human subject, 3-amino-1-propanesulfonic acid, or salts thereof, also referred herein as 3APS. The invention encompasses compounds that will yield or generate 3APS, either in vitro or in vivo.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, compounds of the invention include prodrugs that will yield or generate 3APS once administered in a human. Without wishing to be bound by theory, in some aspects the prodrugs according to invention comprise a "pharmacokinetic<br>
modulating moiety," e.g., B, below, covalently but dissociably linked to 3APS that, e.g., by a linkage, L, below, which will be cleaved once in the blood, plasma or other specific tissue (e.g. brain), thereby releasing 3APS.<br>
Thus, in one aspect, the invention relates to a compound of the Formula I:<br>
as well as pharmaceutically acceptable salts, metabolites, and solvates thereof, where:<br>
B is a pharmacokinetic modulating moiety, which is optionally also bonded to A directly or<br>
indirectly thought a further linking group L;<br>
A is 3-amino-1-propanesulfonic acid moiety (i.e., 3APS bound to L-B); and<br>
L is a cleavable linkage for covalently and dissociably coupling B to A (preferably and<br>
typically via the NH2 group), or is absent, whereby L can be a direct bond or additional<br>
chemical structure providing a cleavable linkage.<br>
Suitable pharmacokinetic modulating moieties (e.g. B) moieties include amino acid or peptide moieties, carbamate moieties, non-amino-acid amide moieties, carbohydrate-derived moieties and analogs such as inositol-derived moieties, N-hydroxy and derivatives thereof (e.g., where the H in OH is replaced by an OH protecting group). B can also comprise a cyclic double protected 3APS molecule and precursors (e.g., where a moiety connects NH? and SO3H of 3APS, e.g., sulfinic acids, thiols, sulfides, disulfides, etc.), and combinations thereof. More generally B moieties include N-protecting groups. B can also be the molecule 3APS itself (see gemini dimers).<br>
Suitable linkages L will be any which are cleaved as described herein, e.g., by enzymes mentioned herein or others in blood, plasma and or brain cells, in vitro or in vivo. Linkages will generally comprise a bond which is known to be so cleavable such as but not limited to, a peptide, amide, ester, sulfide, disulfide, carboxamate, urea, -N-O-, etc. bond, and others as demonstrated for example in the structures disclosed herein, all of which are in general applicable as linkages, L, in compounds in general. Actual cleavability of the linker can be assessed in vitro and/or in vivo by using hydrolytic-, enzymatic- (e.g. peptidase, esterase) or metabolic-based tests and assays well known in the art. International PCT application WO 91/14434, published applications US 2005/0096317, US 2006/0046967 and provisional application US 60/xxx,xxx filed concurrently herewith, are all incorporated herein by reference since they describe a variety of linkers that may be useful according to the present invention.<br>
In another aspect, the invention relates to Formula I-A (and salts, esters and solvates thereof)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein,<br>
Rx and Ry are independently selected from hydrogen and a protecting group, wherein R" and Ry are not both hydrogen; and<br>
L1 and L2 are each a cleavable linkage; wherein when Rx is H, L1 is absent, and when Ry is H, then L2 is absent.<br>
The term "protecting group" refers to a group inhibiting and reducing metabolism of the amino group of SAPS. Examples of protecting groups include, without limitation, an amino acid residue, a carbamate, a non-amino acid amide, a carbohydrate-derived residue, a N-hydroxy-derived residue, a cyclic double protecting group, and the like.<br>
According to preferred embodiments, the compounds of the invention exhibit numerous advantageous properties. In one embodiment, the compound is a prodrug which bypasses first-pass metabolism by the liver and/or the digestive tract (e.g. gut, stomach, or intestine) that is associated with administration of 3APS, per se, thereby increasing bio-distribution and/or bioavailability of 3APS as compared to an administration of a molar equivalent of 3APS. Bypassing hepatic fist-pass metabolism modifies, improves or increases pharmacokinetic parameters of 3APS such as the AUC, the Cmax and/or Tmax of 3APS. In one embodiment, the compound is a prodrug which exhibits an increased absorption by the gastrointestinal tract, compared to the administration a molar equivalent of 3APS per so. In one embodiment, the compound is a prodrug which provides a slow release of 3APS over time. In another embodiment, the compound is a prodrug which increases brain levels of 3APS when compared to the administration a molar equivalent of 3APS per se. In another embodiment, the compound is a prodrug which lessens common side effects associated with the administration of 3APS per se. For instance, in a preferred embodiment, the prodrug exhibits a better gastrointestinal tolerability than 3APS.<br>
In preferred embodiments the compounds and/or compositions of the invention achieve one or more of the following benefits: (1) reducing the molar dose of 3APS administered to a patient (e.g. due to a improved absorption when compared to 3APS or due to a reduction in the first-pass metabolism of 3APS); (2) avoiding common side effects such as gastrointestinal irritation associated with an oral administration of 3APS; (3) improving penetration of 3APS across the BBB; (4) reducing the side effects associated with 3APS<br>
 <br>
(e.g. by lessening gastrointestinal problems or by increasing the relative amount of 3APS reaching the brain; (5) increasing concentration or levels of 3APS in desired tissues or fluids (e.g. brain, CSF). Other benefits will be apparent to those skilled in the art.<br>
The invention pertains to both salt forms and acid/base forms of the compounds of the invention. For example, the invention pertains not only to the particular salt forms of compounds shown herein as salts, but also the invention includes other pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and the acid and/or base form of the compound. The invention also pertains to salt forms of compounds shown herein. Compounds of the invention are also shown in Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, Table 4 and Table 4B below.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may exhibit polymorphism. Polymorphs of compounds according to this invention may be prepared by crystallization under different conditions. For example, using different solvents or different solvent mixtures for recrystallization; crystallization at different temperatures; various modes of cooling ranging from very fast to very slow cooling during crystallization. Polymorphs may also be obtained by heating or melting a prodrug followed by gradual or fast cooling. The presence of polymorphs may be determined by solid probe NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, powder X-ray diffraction or other such techniques.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may also exist in the form of a solvato, for example, hydrate, ethanolate, n-proponalate, iso-propanolate, 1-butanolate, 2-butanolate and solvates of other physiologically acceptable solvents, such as the Class 3 solvents described in the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH), Guidance for Industry, Q3C Impurities: Residual Solvents (1997). The present invention includes each solvate and mixtures thereof.<br>
The amino acid or peptidic moiety, the carbamate moiety, the non-amino acid amide moiety, the carbohydrate-derived moiety and analogs such as inositol-derived, the A/-hydroxy moiety and derivatives, or any other pharmacokinetic modulating moiety of the prodrugs, including cyclic double protected 3APS and precursors (e.g. sulfinic acids, thiol, sulfide, disulfide, etc), and combinations thereof, according to the invention may be cleaved prior to absorption by the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., within the stomach or intestinal lumen) and/or after absorption by the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., in intestinal tissue, blood, liver, or other suitable tissue of a mammal). In certain embodiments, 3APS remains covalently attached to the pharmacokinetic modulating moiety during transit across the intestinal mucosal barrier to provide protection from presystemic metabolism. In certain embodiments, pharmacokinetic modulating moieties according to the invention are essentially not metabolized to the corresponding 3APS within cells of the intestine or liver (e.g. enterocytes, hepatocytes), but generates the parent 3APS molecule once within the systemic circulation. In certain embodiments, at least some of the prodrug administered generates the<br>
corresponding 3APS only once in the brain, i.e. after it has passed the blood brain barrier (BBB). Cleavage of the pharmacokinetic modulating moiety of prodrugs according to the invention after absorption by the gastrointestinal tract may allow these prodrugs to be absorbed into the systemic circulation either by active transport, passive diffusion, or by a combination of both active and passive processes. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition, formulation, or dosage form of the present invention is capable of maintaining a therapeutically effective concentration of 3APS in the plasma or blood of a patient for a time period of at least about 1 hour, for at least 2 hours, for at least 3 hours, 4 hours, for at least about 8 hours, for a period of at least about 12 hours, at least about 16 hours, at least about 20 hours, and in certain embodiments for at least about 24 hours after the pharmaceutical composition, formulation, or dosage form comprising a corresponding compound according to the invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle is orally administered to the patient. In certain embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition, formulation, or dosage form of the present invention is capable of improving the Tmax of SAPS by at least 2 fold, or by at least 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 fold or more.<br>
The pharmacokinetic modulating moiety of certain of the compounds according to the invention may be cleaved either chemically and/or enzymatically. One or more enzymes present in the stomach, intestinal lumen, intestinal tissue, blood, liver, brain, or any other suitable tissue of a mammal may enzymatically cleave the amino acid or peptidic moiety of the compound. If the pharmacokinetic modulating moiety is cleaved after absorption by the gastrointestinal tract, certain of the compounds according to the invention may have the opportunity to be absorbed into the systemic circulation from the large intestine. In certain embodiments, the pharmacokinetic modulating moiety is cleaved after absorption by the gastrointestinal tract or after crossing the BBB.<br>
Although theory of operation is discussed herein, for specific compound structures, including all generic structural formulas and specific names and formulas of compounds, the invention is not limited by any such theories unless specifically stated otherwise. Thus, all uses of all novel compounds are encompassed by the invention, irrespective of mechanism or theory of operation.<br>

The capability of releasing the parent 3APS molecule(s) may be tested and, in many cases, it can be predicted. More preferably, the linker is designed to bind the 3APS molecules via their nitrogen atoms (for improved protection against first pass metabolism), but as exemplified hereinbefore, it is also possible to bind the 3APS molecules via the oxygen atom of their sulfonate group (e.g., through an ester-type of linkage) or via their sulfur atom (e.g., sulfonamide linked dimers).

The synthesis of compounds of the invention is preferably carried out in a solvent. Suitable solvents are liquids at ambient room temperature and pressure or remain in the liquid state under the temperature and pressure conditions used in the reaction. The choice of solvent is within the general skills of the skilled artisan and will depend on the reaction conditions, such, temperature, the nature of the reagents and starting material, solubility and stability of the reagents and starting material, the type of reaction, and the like. Depending on the circumstances, solvents may be distilled or degassed. Solvents may be, for example, aliphatic hydrocarbons (e.g., hexanes, heptanes, ligroin, petroleum ether, cyclohexane, or methylcyclohexane) and halogenated hydrocarbons (e.g., methylenechloride, chloroform, carbontetrachloride, dichloroethane, chlorobenzene, or dichlororbenzene); aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., benzene, toluene, tetrahydronaphthalene, ethylbenzene, or xylene); ethers (e.g., diglyme, methyl-tert-butyl ether, methyl-tert-amyl ether, ethyl- tert-butyl ether, diethylether, diisopropylether, tetrahydrofuran or methyltetrahydrofurans, dioxane, dimethoxyethane, or diethyleneglycol dimethylether); amides (e.g., N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide); nitriles (e.g., acetonitrile); ketones (e.g., acetone); esters (e.g., methyl acetate or ethyl acetate); alcohols (e.g., methanol, ethanol, isopropanol); water and mixtures thereof.<br>

///. Exemplary synthesis ofamino acid prodrugs according to the Invention<br>
The following schemes are for illustration purposes and are not intended to be<br>
limiting. The coupling of 3-amino-1-propanesulfonic acid with a first amino acid may be<br>
generally represented by Scheme 1: Scheme 1:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R1, R2 and R4 are as previously disclosed, Rz is R3 or a protecting group, and X is the leaving group of an activated ester.<br>
In Scheme 1, a monoamino acid prodrug of 3-amino-1-propanesulfonic acid is produced by reacting its free amino group (or a protected sulfonate ester variant) with an activated ester of the desired amino acid (which may be N-protected). Group C(O)X of the activated ester may be an acyl halide, mixed anhydride, succinimide ester, or may be a carboxylic acid activated by a peptide coupling agent (e.g., carbodiimides (such as EDO (1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-diisopropylethylcarbodiimide)) and uroniums (such as HATU (O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N,N'-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate))), in the presence of a base (e.g., amines (such as DIPEA (N,N-diisopropylethylamine), hydroxides (such as sodium hydroxide), carbonates (such as potassium carbonate), etc), and optionally a catalyst (e.g. 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine (DMAP), 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt)). The choice of base and catalyst will depend mainly on the nature of the activated ester.<br>
At this stage, protecting groups (Rz on amine or protecting groups present on heteroatoms in R1 and R2 groups) may be removed. Protecting groups on heteroatoms other than on the amine may not be removed if further amino acid couplings are necessary (see Scheme 2). Protecting groups of oxygen atoms may include benzyl and silyl ethers, acetals and esters, protecting groups of nitrogen may include carbamates and fluorene derivatives. They are cleaved by widely used procedures (see, for example, Greene and Wuts (1991), supra).<br>
Scheme 2:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R1, R2 and R4 are defined respectively as R1, R2 and R4 but may or may not be the<br>
same as R1, R2 and R4 in the above scheme, and R1, R2, R4, Rz and X are as previously disclosed.<br>
Scheme 2 is used to produce prodrugs comprising two or more amino acids attached to 3APS. Coupling conditions are generally the same as described for Scheme 1. Subsequent amino acids are added in the same manner, with a deprotection of the aminc group between each coupling step. If other protecting groups are present on heteroatoms of the residues, they may be removed during a last chemical step.<br>
In general, after completion of the reaction, the product is isolated from the reaction mixture according to standard techniques. For example, the solvent is removed by evaporation or filtration if the product is solid, optionally under reduced pressure. After the completion of the reaction, water may be added to the residue to make the aqueous layer acidic or basic and the precipitated compound filtered, although care should be exercised when handling water-sensitive compounds. Similarly, water may be added to the reaction mixture with a hydrophobic solvent to extract the target compound. The organic layer may be washed with water, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate or sodium sulfate, and the solvent is evaporated to obtain the target compound. The target compound thus obtained may be purified, if necessary, e.g., by recrystallization, reprecipitation, chromatography, or by converting it to a salt by addition of an acid or base.<br>
IV. Alternate routes and vehicles for delivering 3APS by minimizing or lessoning hepatic first-pass metabolism<br>
As indicated hereinbefore, an aspect of the invention concerns new routes of administration (e.g. transdermally, subcutaneously, intranasally, etc.) and new pharmaceutical vehicles (e.g. patches, implants, spray, formulations (including for oral administration)) for lessening hepatic first-pass metabolism of 3APS.<br>
Transdermal drug delivery devices<br>
The delivery of drugs by the transdermal route is an area of increasing interest and offers the advantage of allowing a prolonged, steady input of drug into the blood. Transdermal delivery of 3APS is one preferred embodiment of the invention because it could avoid hepatic first-pass metabolism that is associated with administration of 3APS, and thus increase the therapeutic effectiveness of 3APS. Transdermal delivery may also help avoid the pain associated with injections, and may increase dosage compliance.<br>
Accordingly, certain aspects of the present invention relate to a method for the delivery of a compound according to the invention, preferably 3APS, to improve the effectiveness of the compound in the treatment of cognitive disorders. The invention further relates to a method of delivering a compound according to the invention, preferably 3APS, wherein the compound may be administered in a transdermal patch.<br>
 <br>
Transdermal drug delivery devices according to the invention can be manufactured using techniques and components well known to the skilled artisan. Transdermal drug delivery devices typically involve includes a backing layer, which may optionally be composed of a pigmented polyester film, a drug reservoir, a microporous membrane that controls the rate of delivery of the drug from the system to the skin surface, and an adhesive formulation to attach the delivery system to a subject. Optionally, the adhesive formulation may include the drug, thus providing a more immediate bolus of the compound upon application of the patch to a subject.<br>
Transdermal drug delivery devices also typically involve a carrier (such as a liquid, gel, or solid matrix, or a pressure sensitive adhesive) into which the drug to be delivered is incorporated. The drug-containing carrier is then placed on the skin and the drug, along with any adjuvants and excipients, is delivered to the skin. Typically the portions of the carrier that are not in contact with the subject's skin are covered by a backing. The backing serves to protect the carrier (and the components contained in the carrier, including the drug) from the environment and prevents loss of the ingredients of the drug delivery device to the environment. Because hydration of the stratum corneum is known to enhance transport of certain drugs across the skin, it is sometimes desirable that the backing have a relatively low moisture vapor transmission rate in order to retain moisture at the site covered by the drug delivery device. In order to maintain the health of the covered skin during long term wear (e.g., for periods in excess of a day) by allowing the skin to breath, it is also desirable that the backing have relatively high permeability to oxygen. Further, as the backing is in contact with the components of the carrier, including the drug and any adjuvants and excipients, it is important that the backing be stable to such components in order that the backing retains its structural integrity, tensile strength, and conformability to the skin. It is also desirable that the backing not absorb drug or other excipients from the carrier. In connection with the preparation of certain reservoir-type transdermal drug delivery devices, it is also desirable for the backing to be heat sealable at a relatively low temperature to itself and to a variety of other polymeric substrates. Backing materials that have found use in transdermal drug delivery devices include metal foils, metalized plastic films, and single layered and multilayered polymeric films (see U.S. Patent 5,264,219).<br>
Membranes useful in the construction of a transdermal patch are known in the art and include, but are not limited to, CoTran™ membranes commercially available from 3M, such as the COTRAN™ 9701, 9702, 9705, 9706, 9715, 9716, 9726, and COTRAN™ 9728 membranes. Backing useful in the construction of a transdermal patch are known in the art and include, but are not limited to, backing material commercially available from 3M, such as COTRAN™ and SCOTCHPAK™ backings. Likewise, liners are well known in the art and may be obtained from a number of commercial sources. Optionally, a gelling agent may be<br>
 <br>
optionally added at up to 20% by volume. Gelling agents, include, but are not limited to: crosslinked acrylic acid polymers, such as the "carbomer" family of polymers, e.g., carboxypolyalkylenes that may be obtained commercially under the tradenamo CARBOPOL™; hydrophilic polymers, such as polyethylene oxides, polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene copolymers and polyvinylalcohol; cellulosic polymers, such as hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxycthyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate, and methyl cellulose; gums such as tragacanth and xanthan gum; sodium alginate; and gelatin.<br>
Those skilled in the art will readily identified the proper combination and/or concentration of backing layer, drug reservoir, membrane, carrier, backing, penetration enhancer, gelling agent, etc. If necessary, one could refer to the numerous publications on the subject, including the patent literature such as EP 1 602 367, US 2005/019384, US 2005/0074487 and US 2005/175680 all describing transdermal drug delivery devices and associated. For instance, the absorption through human skin of a drug may be used to determine the feasibility of transdermal delivery with a particular carrier or vehicle. For example, penetration of a compound according to the invention, preferably 3APS, across human epidermis may be measured in vitro using glass diffusion cells. Therefore, optimization of the compound's absorption is achieved by use of formulations disclosed herein and known in the art as penetration enhancers. Additional well known tests and assays include permeability rate studies, absorption studies, diffusion assays, time-course profiling for penetration across human epidermis, irritancy studies, etc.<br>
Clinical studies indicate that an oral dose of a 3APS of about 100 and/or 150 mg bid may produce a beneficial treatment for cognitive disorders, such as AD. Since transdermal administration of a compound according to the invention, preferably 3APS, is believed to be subject to reduced first-pass metabolism, the dosage of a 3APS may be reduced when administered transdermally. On the qther hand, transdermal administration could be helpful to increase the dosage of 3APS by avoiding common side effects such as gastrointestinal irritation associated with an oral administration of that drug.<br>
A benefit of a transdermal dosage form includes improved subject compliance, due to the possibility of reduced administrations. For example, a transdermal patch of the invention may be formulated so as to provide one, two, three, four, five, six or seven days of medication. In an exemplary embodiment, the transdermal patch provides medication for about three days, before it is desirable to replace the patch. In another exemplary embodiment, the transdermal patch provides seven days of medication, before it is desirable to replace the patch. In addition, the transdermal dosage may be formulated with any desirable dosage of a compound according to the invention. For example, the transdermal dosage may provide the equivalent dosage to oral administration of 100 mg bid, 150 mg bid,<br>
200 mg bid, 250 mg bid, 300 mg bid, 350 mg bid, or 400 mg bid. As such, a transdermal patch(es) having the equivalent dosage to oral administration of 150 mg bid may be administered to a subject for a desired period of time, for example, four weeks, and then a patch or patches having the equivalent dosage to oral administration of 200 mg bid may be administered for a desired period of time.<br>
Also included within the invention is a kit, which may contain a desired supply of patches, for example, a one month supply of transdermal patches. Optionally, a kit may be organized into a plurality of, e.g., three, differently identified (numbered, colored or the like) parts, wherein the contents of a first part are initially administered, followed by administration of the contents of a second part, which are then followed by administration of the contents of the third part. Alternatively, a kit may contain a combination of patches and oral formulations.<br>
V. Subjects and Patient Populations<br>
The term "subject" includes living organisms in which Ap-amyloidosis can occur, or which are susceptible to A(3-amyloid diseases, e.g., Alzheimer's disease, etc. Examples of subjects include humans, chickens, ducks, Peking ducks, geese, monkeys, deer, cows, rabbits, sheep, goats, dogs, cats, mice, rats, and transgenic species thereof. The term "subject" preferably includes animals susceptible to states characterized by neuronal cell death, e.g. mammals, e.g. humans. The animal can be an animal model for a disorder, e.g., a transgenic mouse with an Alzheimer's-type neuropathology. In preferred embodiments, the subject is a mammal, more preferably a human subject.<br>
The term "human subject" includes humans susceptible to benefit from SAPS administration, and more particularly those susceptible to or diagnosed of having an amyloid-p related disease and/or suffering from a neurodegenerative disease, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, etc.<br>
In certain embodiments of the invention, the human subject is in need of treatment by the methods of the invention, and is selected for treatment based on this need. A subject in need of treatment is art-recognized, and includes subjects that have been identified as having a disease or disorder related to p-amyloid deposition, has a symptom of such a disease or disorder, or is at risk of such a disease or disorder, and would be expected, based on diagnosis, e.g., medical diagnosis, to benefit from treatment (e.g., curing, healing, preventing, alleviating, relieving, altering, remedying, ameliorating, improving, or affecting the disease or disorder, the symptom of the disease or disorder, or the risk of the disease or disorder).<br>
For example, the human subject may be a human over 30 years old, human over 40 years old, a human over 50 years old, a human over 60 years old, a human over 70 years old, a human over 80 years old, a human over 85 years old, a human over 90 years old, or a human over 95 years old. The subject may be a female human, including a postmenopausal female human, who may be on hormone (estrogen) replacement therapy. The subject may also be a male human. In another embodiment, the subject is under 40 years old.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the subject is a human subject having an Alzheimer's-type neuropathology. Individuals presently suffering from Alzheimer's disease can be recognized from characteristic dementia, as well as the presence of risk factors described below. In addition, a number of diagnostic tests based on cognitive and neurological testing are available for identifying individuals who have AD. For example, individuals suffering from Alzheimer's disease can be diagnosed by the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale, Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog), or any other test known in the art, as discussed herein. Baseline scores on suitable metrics including the MMSE and the ADAS together with other metrics designed to evaluate a more normal population can be used to find an at risk population. Another method for identifying an at risk group utilizes an assay for neural thread protein in the urine; see, e.g., Munzar et al., Neurology and Clinical Neurophysiology, Vol. 2002, No. 1 . Patients with high risk for Alzheimer's Disease can also be selected from a population by screening for early signs of memory loss or other difficulties associated with pre-Alzheimer's symptomatology, a family history of Alzheimer's Disease, patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), genetic risk factors, age, sex, and other features found to predict high-risk for Alzheimer's Disease.<br>
The term "prevention" or "preventing" is also used to describe the administration of a compound or composition of the invention to a subject who is at risk of (or susceptible to) such a disease or condition. Patients amenable to treatment for prevention of the disease or condition include individuals at risk of the disease or condition but not showing symptoms, as well as patients presently showing symptoms. In the case of Alzheimer's disease, virtually anyone is at risk of suffering from Alzheimer's disease if he or she lives long enough. Therefore, the present methods can be administered prophylactically to the general population without any assessment of the risk of the subject patient. But the present methods are especially useful for individuals who do have a known risk of Alzheimer's disease. Such individuals include those having relatives who have experienced this disease, and those whose risk is determined by analysis of genetic or biochemical markers, including brain plaques diagnosed by imaging methods, e.g., MRI, PET, SPECT etc.. Examples of such imaging methods are discussed in Burggren et al., Current Topics in Medicinal Chemistry, vol. 2002, no. 2, pp. 385-393, and Sair et al., Neuroradiology, vol. 46, pp. 93-104<br>
(2002). Alzheimer's disease predisposing factors identified or proposed in the scientific literature include, among others, a genotype predisposing a subject to Abheimer's disease; environmental factors predisposing a subject to Alzheimer's disease; past history of infection by viral and bacterial agents predisposing a subject to Alzheimer's disease; and vascular factors predisposing a subject to Alzheimer's disease. Genetic markers of risk toward Alzheimer's disease include mutations in the APP gene, particularly mutations at position 717 and positions 670 and 671 referred to as the Hardy and Swedish mutations respectively (see Hardy et al., TINS 20, 154-158 (1997)). Other markers of risk arc mutations in the presenilin genes, PS1 and PS2, and ApoE4, family history of AD, hypercholesterolemia or atherosclerosis. The subject may be shown to be at risk by a diagnostic brain imaging technique, for example, one that measures brain activity, plaque deposition, or brain atrophy. The human subject may also be shown to be at risk by a cognitive test such as Clinical Dementia Rating ("CDR"), Alzheimer's disease Assessment Scale-Cognition ("ADAS-Cog"), Disability Assessment for Dementia ("DAD") or Mini-Mental State Examination ("MMSE") and/or by any other cognition test known in the art.<br>
In another embodiment, the human subject exhibits no symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. In another embodiment, the subject is at least 40 years of age and exhibits no symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. In another embodiment, the human subject is at least 40 years of age and exhibits one or more symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.<br>
By using the methods and compounds of the present invention, the levels of amyloid 3 peptides in a subject's plasma or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) could be significantly reduced from levels prior to treatment from about 10 to about 100 percent, or even about 50 to about 100 percent, e.g., 15, 25, 40, 60, 70, 75, 80, 90, 95 or 99%. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, the human subject can have an elevated level of amyloid Aß40 and Aß42 peptide in the blood and/or CSF prior to a treatment according to the present methods, e.g. Aß40 levels of greater than about 10 pg/mL, or greater than about 20 pg/mL, or greater than about 35 pg/mL, or even greater than about 40 pg/mL; and Aß42 levels 30 pg/mL to about 200 pg/mL, or even to about 500 pg/mL. Similarly, according to some embodiments, the methods and compounds of the present invention help reduce the size and/or number of Aß plaques or Ap deposits in the brain, from about 10 to about 100 percent, or even about 50 to about 100 percent, e.g., 15, 25, 40, 60, 70, 75, 80, 90, 95 or 99%, when compared to levels prior to treatment.<br>
VI. Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
Preferably, the compounds of the invention are formulated prior to administration into pharmaceutical compositions using techniques and procedures well known in the art. Accordingly, in another embodiment, the present invention relates to pharmaceutical<br>
compositions (e.g. solutions, suspensions or emulsions) comprising effective amounts of one or more compounds according to any of the Formulae herein and a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle, as well as methods of using and manufacturing such pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions are formulated into suitable administration (orally, parenterally, (IV, IM, depo-IM, SC, and depo SC), sublingually, intranasally (inhalation), intrathecally, topically, or rectally). Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles include, without limitation, any non-immunogenic pharmaceutical carrier or diluent suitable for oral, parenteral, nasal, mucosal, transdermal, topical, intrathecal, rectal, intravascular (IV), intraarterial (IA), intramuscular (IM), and subcutaneous (SC) administration routes, such as phosphate buffer saline (PBS). Also, the present invention includes such compounds which have been lyophilized and which may be reconstituted to form pharmaceutically acceptable formulations for administration, as by intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous injection. Administration may also be intradermal or transdermal.<br>
The vehicle can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be achieved by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, isotonic agents are included, for example, sugars, sodium chloride, or polyalcohols such as mannitol and sorbitol, in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent which delays absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate or gelatin.<br>
Preferably, the compound(s) of the invention can be orally administered. Formulations of the present invention include those suitable for oral administration. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Methods of preparing these formulations or compositions include the step of bringing into association a compound of the present invention with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle (e.g. an inert diluent or an assimilable edible carrier)and, optionally, one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association a compound of the present invention with liquid carriers, or finely divided solid carriers, or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product. The amount of the therapeutic agent in such therapeutically useful compositions is such that a suitable dosage will be obtained.<br>
Formulations of the invention suitable for oral administration may be in the form of capsules (e.g. hard or soft shell gelatin capsule), cachets, pills, tablets, lozenges, powders, granules, pellets, dragees, e.g., coated (e.g., enteric coated) or uncoated, or as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid, or as an oil-in-water or water-in-oil liquid emulsion, or as an elixir or syrup, or as pastilles (using an inert base, such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia) or as mouth washes and the like, each containing a predetermined amount of a compound of the present invention as an active ingredient. A compound of the present invention may also be administered as a bolus, electuary or paste, or incorporated directly into the subject's diet. Moreover, in certain embodiments these pellets can be formulated to (a) provide for instant or rapid drug release (i.e., have no coating on them); (b) be coated, e.g., to provide for sustained drug release over time; or (c) be coated with an enteric coating for better gastrointestinal tolerability.<br>
In solid dosage forms of the invention for oral administration the active ingredient is mixed with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate, or any of the following: fillers or extenders, such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, or silicic acid; binders, such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, sucrose or acacia; humectants, such as glycerol; disintegrating agents, such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate; solution retarding agents, such as paraffin; absorption accelerators, such as quaternary ammonium compounds; wetting agents, such as, for example, cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate; absorbents, such as kaolin and bentonite clay; lubricants, such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof; and coloring agents. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the pharmaceutical compositions may also comprise buffering agents. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipicnts as lactose or milk sugars, as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like.<br>
Peroral composftions typically include liquid solutions, emulsions, suspensions, and the like. The pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles suitable for preparation of such compositions are well known in the art. Typical components of carriers for syrups, elixirs, emulsions and suspensions include ethanol, glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, liquid sucrose, sorbitol and water. For a suspension, typical suspending agents include methyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, tragacanth, and sodium alginate; typical wetting agents include lecithin and polysorbate 80; and typical preservatives include methyl paraben and sodium benzoate. Peroral liquid compositions may also contain one or more components such as sweeteners, flavoring agents and colorants disclosed above.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions (where water soluble) or dispersions, and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. In all cases, the composition must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the therapeutic agent in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the therapeutic agent into a sterile vehicle which contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze-drying which yields a powder of the active ingredient (i.e., the therapeutic agent) plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations are also provided which are suitable for administration as an aerosol, by inhalation. These formulations comprise a solution or suspension of the desired compound of any Formula herein or a plurality of solid particles of such compound(s). The desired formulation may be placed in a small chamber and nebulized. Nebulization may be accomplished by compressed air or by ultrasonic energy to form a plurality of liquid droplets or solid particles comprising the agents or salts. The liquid droplets or solid particles should have a particle size in the range of about 0.5 to about 5 microns. The solid particles can be obtained by processing the solid agent of any Formula described herein, or a salt thereof, in any appropriate manner known in the art, such as by micronization. The size of the solid particles or droplets will be, for example, from about 1 to about 2 microns. In this respect, commercial nebulizers are available to achieve this purpose.<br>
A pharmaceutical formulation suitable for administration as an aerosol may be in the form of a liquid, the formulation will comprise a water-soluble agent of any Formula described herein, or a salt thereof, in a carrier which comprises water. A surfactant may be present which lowers the surface tension of the formulation sufficiently to result in the formation of droplets within the desired size range when subjected to nebuli/ation.<br>
The compositions of this invention can also be administered topically to a subject, e.g., by the direct laying on or spreading of the composition on the epidermal or epithelial tissue of the subject, or transdermally via a "patch". Such compositions include, for example, lotions, creams, solutions, gels and solids. These topical compositions may comprise an effective amount, usually at least about 0.1%, or even from about 1% to about 5%, of an agent of the invention. Suitable carriers for topical administration typically remain in place on<br>
the skin as a continuous film, and resist being removed by perspiration or immersion in water. Generally, the carrier is organic in nature and capable of having dispersed or dissolved therein the therapeutic agent. The carrier may include pharmaceutically acceptable emollients, emulsifiers, thickening agents, solvents and the like.<br>
Other compositions useful for attaining systemic delivery of the subject agents include sublingual, buccal and nasal dosage forms. Such compositions typically comprise one or more of soluble filler substances such as sucrose, sorbitol and mannitol; and binders such as acacia, microcrystalline cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose. Glidants, lubricants, sweeteners, colorants, antioxidants and flavoring agents disclosed above may also be included. The compound(s) of the invention may also be administered parenterally, intraperitoneally, intraspinally, or intracerebrally. For such compositions, the compound(s) of the invention can be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and mixtures thereof and in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations may contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms.<br>
To administer the compound(s) of the invention by other than parentcral administration, it may be useful to coat the compound(s) with, or co-administer the compound(s) with a material to prevent its inactivation. For example, the compound(s) of the invention may be administered to a subject in an appropriate carrier, for example, liposomes, or a diluent. Pharmaceutically acceptable diluents include saline and aqueous buffer solutions. Liposomes include water-in-oil-in-water CGF emulsions as well as conventional liposomes.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention may also be coated by conventional methods, typically with pH or time-dependent coatings, such that the compound(s) of the invention is released in the vicinity of the desired location, or at various times to extend the desired action. Such dosage forms typically include, but are not limited to, one or more of cellulose acetate phthalate, polyvinylacetate phthalate, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose phthalate, ethyl cellulose, waxes, and shellac.<br>
The compound(s) of the invention may be packaged as part of a kit, optionally including a container (e.g. packaging, a box, a vial, etc). The kit may be commercially used according to the methods described herein and may include instructions for use in a method of the invention. Additional kit components may include acids, bases, buffering agents, inorganic salts, solvents, antioxidants, preservatives, or metal chelators. The additional kit components are present as pure compositions, or as aqueous or organic solutions that incorporate one or more additional kit components. Any or all of the kit components optionally further comprise buffers.<br>
VII. Dosage<br>
Dosage forms, upon releasing a compound according to the invention, can provide the corresponding SAPS upon in vivo administration to a human patient. It is understood that appropriate doses depend upon a number of factors within the knowledge of the ordinarily skilled physician, veterinarian, or researcher (e.g. see Wells et al. eds., Pharmacotherapy Handbook, 2nd Edition, Appleton and Lange, Stamford, Conn. (2000); PDR Pharmacopoeia, Tarascon Pocket Pharmacopoeia 2000, Deluxe Edition, Tarascon Publishing, Loma Linda, Calif. (2000)). The dose(s) of the compound(s) of the invention will vary, for example, depending upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific agent employed, the age, body weight, general health, gender, and diet of the subject, the time of administration, the route of administration, the rate of excretion, and any drug combination, if applicable, the effect which the practitioner desires the compound to have upon the subject and the properties of the compounds (e.g. bioavailability, stability, potency, toxicity, etc). Such appropriate doses may be determined using the assays described herein. When one or more of the compounds of the invention is to be administered to humans, a physician may for example, prescribe a relatively low dose at first, subsequently increasing the dose until an appropriate response is obtained.<br>
Exemplary doses include milligram or microgram amounts of the compound per kilogram of subject or sample weight (e.g., about 50 micrograms per kilogram to about 500 milligrams per kilogram, about 1 milligram per kilogram to about 100 milligrams per kilogram, about 1 milligram per kilogram to about 50 milligram per kilogram, about 1 milligram per kilogram to about 10 milligrams per kilogram, or about 3 milligrams per kilogram to about 5 milligrams per kilogram). Additional exemplary doses include doses of about 5 to about 500 mg, or about 25 to about 300 mg, or about 25 to about 200 mg, preferably about 50 to about 150 mg, more preferably about 50, about 100, about 150 mg, about 200 mg or about 250 mg, and, preferably, daily or twice daily, or lower or higher amounts. For comparison, exemplary doses for SAPS per se include about 2-3 milligram of SAPS per kilogram of subject (twice daily). See also US 11/103,656, filed on April 12, 2005, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
It is generally advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. The term "unit dosage form" refers to a physically discrete unit suitable as unitary dosages for human subjects and other mammals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with a suitable pharmaceutical vehicle. In an embodiment, the compositions according to the invention are formulated in a unit dosage form, each dosage containing from about 50 mg to about 500 mg, more preferably about 100 mg to about 300 mg of the compound according to the invention. See also US 11/103,656,<br>
filed on April 12, 2005, which is incorporated herein by reference. The specification for the dosage unit forms of the invention may vary and are dictated by and directly dependent on (a) the unique characteristics of the therapeutic agent and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and (b) the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such a therapeutic agent for the treatment of amyloid deposition in subjects.<br>
Administration of the compounds and compositions of the present invention to a subject to be treated can be carried out using known procedures, at dosages and for periods of time effective to achieved a desired purposes (e.g. prevention or treatment of AD, obtaining specific levels of 3APS, etc). Dosage regimens can be adjusted to provide the optimum therapeutic response. For example, several divided doses may be administered daily or the dose may be proportionally reduced as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation.<br>
In one embodiment, the compound(s) of the invention is administered at a therapeutically effective dosage sufficient to inhibit amyloid deposition in a subject, preferably a human subject. When referring to amyloid deposition a "therapeutically effective" dosage inhibits amyloid deposition by, for example, at least about 20%, or by at least about 40%, or even by at least about 60%, or by at least about 80% relative to untreated subjects.<br>
In one embodiment, the compound(s) of the invention is administered at a therapeutically effective dosage for the prevention or treatment of Alzheimer's. When referring to Alzheimer's, a "therapeutically effective" dosage stabilizes cognitive function or prevents a further decrease in cognitive function (i.e., preventing, slowing, or stopping disease progression).<br>
VII. Uses of Compounds, Composition, and Dosage Forms<br>
Another aspect of the invention pertains to a method for inhibiting neuronal cell death by administering an effective amount of a compound of the present invention. In yet another aspect, the invention pertains to a method for providing neuroprotection to a subject having an Ap-amyloid related disease, e.g. Alzheimer's disease, which includes administering an effective amount of a compound of the present invention to the subject, such that neuroprotection is provided. As used herein, the term "neuroprotection" includes protection of neuronal cells of a subject from cell death that may result in initiation of processes such as, but not limited to: the destabilization of the cytoskeleton; DMA fragmentation; the activation of hydrolytic enzymes, such as phospholipasc A2; activation of caspascs, calcium-activated proteases and/or calcium-activated endonucleases; inflammation mediated by macrophages; calcium influx into a cell; membrane potential changes in a cell; the disruption<br>
of cell junctions leading to decreased or absent cell-cell communication; and the activation of expression of genes involved in cell death.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the compounds and compositions of the present invention are used for one or more of the following: to prevent Alzheimer's disease, to treat Alzheimer's disease, or ameliorate symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, to regulate production of or levels of amyloid (3 (A3) peptides, prevent, reduce, or inhibit amyloid deposition in a subject, and to treat or prevent of amyloid-related diseases.<br>
The compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may act to ameliorate the course of a p-amyloid related disease using any of the following mechanisms (this list is meant to be illustrative and not limiting): slowing the rate of p-amyloid fibril formation or deposition; lessening the degree of p-amyloid deposition; inhibiting, reducing, or preventing amyloid fibril formation; inhibiting neurodegeneration or cellular toxicity induced by p-amyloid; inhibiting amyloid induced inflammation; enhancing the clearance of p-amyloid from the brain; enhancing degradation of Ap in the brain; or favoring clearance of amyloid protein prior to its organization in fibrils, and decreasing the ratio of A^42:Ap40 in the CSF or plasma. In another embodiment, the invention pertains to a method for improving cognition in a subject suffering from AD. The method includes administering an effective amount of a therapeutic compound of the invention, such that the subject's cognition is improved. The subject's cognition can be tested using methods known in the art such as the Clinical Dementia Rating ("CDR"), Mini-Mental State Examination ("MMSE"), Disability Assessment for Dementia ("DAD"), and the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognition ("ADAS-Cog"). Improvement in cognition is present within the context of the present invention if there is a measurable difference between the performances of subjects treated using the methods of the invention as compared to members of a placebo group, historical control, or between subsequent tests given to the same subject. The invention also pertains to a method for treating, slowing or stopping a p-amyloid related disease associated with cognitive impairment, by administering to a subject an effective amount of a therapeutic compound of the invention, wherein the annual deterioration of the subject's cognition as measured by any of the foregoing mentioned test is improved.<br>
It is to be understood that wherever values and ranges are provided herein, e.g., in ages of subject populations, dosages, and blood levels, all values and ranges encompassed by these values and ranges, are meant to be encompassed within the scope of the present invention. Moreover, all values in these values and ranges may also be the upper or lower limits of a range.<br>
VIII. Combination Therapy<br>
In certain embodiments, the compounds and composition according to the invention can be used in combination therapy with at least one other therapeutic agent.

Methods of the present invention include administration of one or more compounds or pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention and one or more other therapeutic agents provided that the combined administration does not inhibit the therapeutic efficacy of the one or more compounds of the present invention and/or does not produce adverse combination effects.<br>
In certain embodiments, compositions of the present invention can be administered concurrently with the administration of another therapeutic agent, which can be part of the same pharmaceutical composition as, or in a different composition from, that containing the compounds of the present invention. In certain embodiments, compounds of the present invention can be administered prior or subsequent to administration of another therapeutic agent.

IX. Standard Methods for testing the compounds of the invention.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can be further analyzed, tested or validated using a variety of in vitro assays, or in vivo assays to confirm their safety, bioavailabity, neuroprotection, their capability to deliver SAPS etc. The following arc illustrative of the type of biological assays that can be conducted to assess the instant compounds.<br>
i) Determination of Enzymatic Cleavage of Prodrugs In Vitro<br>
For orally administered prodrugs, it is generally desirable that the prodrug remains intact (i.e., uncleaved) while in the gastrointestinal tract and be cleaved (i.e., to release the parent drug) while in the systemic circulation. A useful level of stability can at least in part be determined by the mechanism and kinetics of absorption of the prodrug by the gastrointestinal tract. A useful level of lability can at least in part be determined by the pharmacokinetics of the prodrug and parent drug in the systemic circulation. In general, prodrugs that are more stable in a Caco-2 S9 and/or pancreatin assay and are more labile in a rat plasma, human plasma, rat liver S9, and/or human liver S9 preparation can be useful as an orally administered prodrug. The results of tests, for determining the enzymatic cleavage of prodrugs in vitro can be used to select prodrugs for in vivo testing.<br>
ii) Bioavailability of Prodrugs in vivo<br>
Prodrugs that provide a bioavailability of the corresponding parent drug that is greater than the bioavailability provided by an equimolar dose of the parent drug administered to a patient by the same route (e.g., oral administration) can be useful as<br>
therapeutic agents. Bioavailability of the compounds of the invention and of released SAPS can be measured in vivo (humans and laboratory animals) using methods well known in the art. Example 3 herein provides an exemplary method for assessing bioavailability in mice.<br>
Hi) In Vivo Assays: Animal Models<br>
Various animal models can be used to the efficacy and/or potency of the compound according to the invention. For example, certain transgenic animal models have been described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,877,399; 5,612,486; 5,387,742; 5,720,936; 5,850,003; 5,877,015, and 5,811,633, and in Ganes et al., (Nature 1995, 373:523). Preferred are animal models that exhibit characteristics associated with the pathophysiology of AD. Administration of the compound inhibitors of the invention to the transgenic mice described herein provides an alternative method for demonstrating the inhibitory activity of the compounds. Administration of the compounds in a pharmaceutically effective carrier and via an administrative route that reaches the target tissue in an appropriate therapeutic amount is also preferred.<br>
iv) Toxicity<br>
A variety of different parameters can be monitored to assess toxicity. Examples of such parameters include, but are not limited to, cell proliferation, monitoring activation of cellular pathways for toxicological responses by gene or protein expression analysis, DNA fragmentation, changes in the composition of cellular membranes, membrane permeability, activation of components of death- receptors or downstream signaling pathways (e.g., caspases), generic stress responses, NF-kappaB activation and responses to mitogens. Related assays are used to assay for apoptosis (a programmed process of cell death) and necrosis, including cGMP formation and NO formation.<br>
Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of the compound(s) and composition(s) of the invention can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50, and usually a larger therapeutic index is more efficacious. While agents that exhibit toxic side effects may be used, care should be taken to design a delivery system that targets such agents to the site of affected tissue in order to minimize potential damage to unaffected cells and, thereby, reduce side effects.<br>
v) Neuroprotection<br>
The following are illustrative of the type of biological assays that can be conducted to assess whether a inhibitory agent has a protective effect against neuronal injury or disease.<br>
a.	Morphological Changes<br>
Apoptosis in many cell types is correlated with altered morphological appearances. Examples of such alterations include, but are not limited to, plasma membrane blebbing, cell shape change, loss of substrate adhesion properties. Such changes are readily detectable with a light microscope. Cells undergoing apoptosis can also be detected by fragmentation and disintegration of chromosomes. These changes can be detected using light microscopy and/or DNA or chromatin specific dyes.<br>
b.	Altered Membrane Permeability<br>
Often the membranes of cells undergoing apoptosis become increasingly permeable. This change in membrane properties can be readily detected using vital dyes (e.g., propidium iodide and trypan blue). Dyes can be used to detect the presence of necrotic cells. For example, certain methods utilize a green-fluorescent LIVE/DEAD™ Cytotoxicity Kit #2, available from Molecular Probes. The dye specifically reacts with cellular amine groups. In necrotic cells, the entire free amine content is available to react with the dye, thus resulting in intense fluorescent staining. In contrast, only the cell-surface amines of viable cells are available to react with the dye. Hence, the fluorescence intensity for viable cells is reduced significantly relative to necrotic cells (see, e. g., Haugland, 1996 Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Chemicals, 6th ed., Molecular Probes, OR).<br>
c.	Dysfunction of Mitochondria! Membrane Potential<br>
Mitochondria provide direct and indirect biochemical regulation of diverse cellular processes as the main energy source in cells of higher organisms. These process include the electron transport chain activity, which drives oxidative phosphorylation to produce metabolic energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (i.e., ATP). Altered or defective mitochondria! activity can result in mitochondrial collapse called the "permeability transition" or mitochondrial permeability transition. Proper mitochondrial functioning requires maintenance of the membrane potential established across the membrane. Dissipation of the membrane potential prevents ATP synthesis and thus halts or restricts the production of a vital biochemical energy source.<br>
Consequently, a variety of assays designed to assess toxicity and cell death involve monitoring the effect of a test agent on mitochondrial membrane potentials or on the mitochondrial permeability transition. One approach is to utilize fluorescent indicators (see,<br>
e.g., Haugland, 1996 Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Chemicals, 6th ed., Molecular Probes, OR, pp. 266-274 and 589- 594). Various non-fluorescent probes can also be utilized (see, e.g., Kamo et al. (1979) J. Membrane Biol. 49:105). Mitochondrial membrane potentials can also be determined indirectly from mitochondrial membrane permeability (see, e.g., Quinn (1976) The Molecular Biology of Cell Membranes, University Park Press, Baltimore, Md., pp. 200-217). Further guidance on methods for conducting such assays is provided in PCT publication WO 00/19200 to Dykens et al.<br>
d.	Caspase Activation<br>
Apoptosis is the process of programmed cell death and involves the activation of a genetic program when cells are no longer needed or have become seriously damaged. Apoptosis involves a cascade of biochemical events and is under the regulation of a number of different genes. One group of genes act as effectors of apoptosis and are referred to as the interleukin-1p converting enzyme (ICE) family of genes. These genes encode a family of cysteine proteases whose activity is increased in apoptosis. The ICE family of proteases is generically referred to as caspase enzymes. The "C" in the name reflects the fact that the enzymes are cysteine proteases, while "Caspase" refers to the ability of those enzymes to cleave after aspartic acid residues.<br>
Consequently, some assays for apoptosis are based upon the observation that caspases are induced during apoptosis. Induction of these enzymes can be detected by monitoring the cleavage of specifically-recognized substrates for these enzymes. A number of naturally occurring and synthetic protein substrates are known (see, e.g., Ellerby et al. (1997) J. Neurosci. 17:6165; Kluck, et al. (1997) Science 275:1132; Nicholson et al. (1995) Nature 376:37; and Rosen and Casciola- Rosen (1997) J. Cell Biochem. 64:50). Methods for preparing a number of different substrates that can be utilized in these assays are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,976,822. This patent also describes assays that can be conducted using whole cells that are amendable to certain of the microfluidic devices described herein. Other methods using FRET techniques are discussed in Mahajan, et al. (1999) Chem. Biol. 6:401-9; and Xu, et al. (1998) Nucl. Acids. Res. 26:2034-5.<br>
e.	Cytochrome C Release<br>
In healthy cells, the inner mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to macromolecules. Thus, one indicator of cell apoptosis is the release or leakage of cytochrome C from the mitochondria. Detection of cytochrome C can be performed using spectroscopic methods because of the inherent absorption properties of the protein. Thus, one detection option with the present devices is to place the cells within a holding space and monitor absorbance at a characteristic absorption wavelength for cytochrome C.<br>
 <br>
Alternatively, the protein can be detected using standard immunological methods (e.g., ELISA assays) with an antibody that specifically binds to cytochrome C (see, e.g., Liu et al. (1996) Cell 86:147).<br>
f.	Assays for Cell Lysis<br>
The final stage of cell death is typically lysis of the cell. When cells die they typically release a mixture of chemicals, including nucleotides, and a variety of other substances (e.g., proteins and carbohydrates) into their surroundings. Some of the substances released include ADP and ATP, as well as the enzyme adenylate cyclase, which catalyzes the conversion of ADP to ATP in the presence of excess ADP. Thus, certain assays involve providing sufficient ADP in the assay medium to drive the equilibrium towards the generation of ATP which can subsequently be detected via a number of different means. One such approach is to utilize a luciferin/luciferase system that is well known to those of ordinary skill in the art in which the enzyme luciferase utilizes ATP and the substrate luciferin to generate a photometrically detectable signal. Further details regarding certain cell lysis assays that can be performed are set forth in PCT publication WO 00/70082.<br>
g.	Ischemic Model Systems<br>
Methods for assaying whether a compound can confer protective neurological effects against ischemia and stroke are discussed by Aarts, et al. (Science 298:846-850, 2002). In general, this assay involves subjecting rats to a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for a relatively short period of time (e.g., about 90 minutes). MCAO can be induced using various methods, including an intraluminal suture method (see, e.g., Longa, E. Z. et al. (1989) Stroke 20:84; and Belayev, L, et al. (1996) Stroke 27:1616). A composition containing the putative inhibitor is introduced into the rat using conventional methods (e.g., via intravenous injection). To evaluate the compositions prophylactic effect, the composition is administered before performing MCAO. If the compound is to be evaluated for its ability to mitigate against an ischemic event that has already occurred, the composition with the compound is introduced after MCAO has been initiated. The extent of cerebral infarction is then evaluated using various measures of neurological function. Examples of such measures include the postural reflex test (Bederson, J. B. et al. (1986) Stroke 17:47?) and the forelimb placing test (De Ryck, M. et al. (1989) Stroke 20:1383). Methods are also described in Aarts et al assessing the effects of NMDA-induced excitotoxicity using in vitro assays.<br>
h. MTT Cytotoxicity Assay<br>
The MTT assay is another assay which has been widely used to assess cytotoxicity in neuronal cells. The cellular toxicity can assessed using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, Md.) following the recommendations of the manufacturer.<br>
/. Trypan Blue Cell Viability Measurement<br>
Cell viability can be measured using the trypan blue exclusion method (Yao et al., Brain Res., 889, 181-190 (2001)).<br>
/. Determination of Cellular ATP Levels<br>
Cellular ATP Levels can be indicative of cell viability. Cellular ATP concentrations can be measured using the ATPLite-M® luminescence assay (Packard BioSciences Co.). For example, in this assay, cells typically are cultured on black 96-well ViewPlate® and the ATP concentrations are measured on a TopCount NXT® counter (Packard BioSciences Co.) following the recommendations of the manufacturer.<br>
vi). Gastrointestinal absorption<br>
The compounds or drugs according to the invention can be further analyzed, tested or validated for their ability to be absorbed by the gut and/or intestine if so desired.<br>
Intestinal permeability and transport of a drug candidate may be estimated using a variety of in vitro, in situ, as well as in vivo models (Balimane et al. (2000) J Pharmacol Toxicol Methods 44:385-401; Hidalgo I. (2001) Curr Top Med Chem 1:385-401, Hillgreen K, Kato A and Borchardt R. (1995) 15:83-109).<br>
For instance, parallel artificial membrane permeability (PAMPA) assay and cell-based systems such as Caco-2 and Mardin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells are the most frequently used in vitro models. The PAMPA model consists of a hydrophobic filter material coated with a mixture of lecithin/phospholipids dissolved in an inert organic solvent creating an artificial lipid membrane barrier that mimics the intestinal epithelium. Caco-2 cells, a human colon adenocarcinoma, undergo spontaneous enterocytic differentiation in culture and become polarized cells with well-established tight junctions, resembling intestinal epithelium in humans. Caco-2 cell model has been the most popular and the most extensively characterized cell-based model in examining the permeability of drugs in both the pharmaceutical industries and academia. Alternatively, MDCK cells which also develop tight junctions and form monolayers of polarized cells are used.<br>
An in situ study such as an intestinal perfusion could also be performed to assess drug absorption. Isolated intestinal segments comprise the absorptive cells and the underlying muscle layers. As it is commonly used, this technique only allows sampling from<br>
the mucosal side; drug disappearance is assumed to be equal to drug absorption. Typically, a whole animal absorption study (pharmacokinetic study) will be performed in parallel with the in vitro and/or in situ studies to assess intestinal permeability. In general, drug absorption in animals is believed to be a good predictor of absorption in humans.<br>
vii) Gastrointestinal toxicity<br>
The compounds or drugs according to the invention can be further analyzed, tested or validated for gastrointestinal (Gl) toxicity. Gastrointestinal toxicity of a compound in vivo can be reliably established through the implementation of a standard battery of general toxicological assessments. Generally, regulatory test guidelines from the EU, OECD, ICH, FDA and JMOHW are used as reference material for the preparation of study protocols for such assessments. In North America, the toxicological assessments will generally be carried out in compliance with the United States Food and Drug Administration Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations Part 58, Good Laboratory Practice for Non-clinical studies issued on December 22,1978, Federal Register plus subsequent amendments.<br>
Within the context of such a non-clinical assessment of the toxicity of a particular compound, Gl toxicity may specifically be assessed through the monitoring of body weight gain, the gross examination of materials emitted by the test subject (specifically vomitus and feces) and the monitoring of food/water consumption (appetence). Furthermore, upon termination of a non-clinical toxicological assessment, the retention and processing of Gl tract tissues from the test subject(s) to the slide stage, followed by histopathological examination of said tissues by a trained pathologist, is a useful tool, complementary to the aforementioned "in-life" observations.<br>
viii) Crossing of the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB)<br>
The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a very specialized barrier system of endothelial cells that separates the blood from the underlying brain cells, providing protection to brain cells and preserving brain homeostasis. The brain endothelium has a complex arrangement of tight junctions between the cells that restrict the passage of molecules. Typically the BBB is permeable to small and lipophilic molecules, but larger molecules are generally not transported across unless there is an active transport system available. Thus this is one of the stumbling blocks for drug delivery. An additional problem is the very effective drug efflux systems (P-glycoprotein), which pump the drug back out of cells.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can be further analyzed, tested or validated for their ability to cross the BBB is so desired. Many in-vitro, in-vivo and in-silico methods may be employed during drug development to mimic the BBB (Lohmann et al. (2002) Predicting blood-brain barrier permeability of drugs: evaluation of different in vitro<br>
assays. J Drug Target 10:263-276; Nicolazzo et al. (2006) Methods to assess drug permeability across the blood-brain barrier. J Pharm Pharmacol58:281-293). In-vitro models include primary endothelial cell culture and immortalized cell lines such as Caco-2, BMEC, MDCK. These cells are useful as a screening method and can appropriately rank compounds in order of BBB permeability. In vivo models such as the internal carotid artery single injection or perfusion, intravenous bolus injection, brain efflux index and intracerebral microdialysis provide more accurate information regarding brain uptake, and these can be complemented with novel imaging techniques (such as magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography), although such methods are not suited to high-throughput permeability assessment.<br>
ix) Brain and CSF level<br>
The brain and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of the compounds or drugs according to the invention can be assessed, measured or estimated using various models methods, and assays (see Potchoiba MJ, and Nocerini, MR (2004) DMD 32:1190-1198; Orlowska-Madjack M. (2004) Acta Neurobiol Exp 64: 177-188; and Hocht, C, Opezza, JA and Taira, CA (2004) Curr Drug Discov Technol 1:269-85)<br>
One of the most common techniques is probably a brain sampling after a whole animal absorption study (pharmacokinetic). For instance, pharmacokinetics (PK) profiles of the compound of the invention could be investigated using typical nonclinical PK studies in mice. Briefly, at different time-points following intravenous, subcutaneous and oral compound administrations, brain, CSF and plasma samples are collected. The brain, CSF and plasma samples are then analyzed by LC/MS to determine the concentration-time profiles of the compound.<br>
Alternatives such as brain dialysis or distribution of a radiolabelled compound with or without autoradioluminography could also be used. A typical example is a tissue distribution study to assess the time course elimination of radioactivity from tissues following the administration of a known quantity of radiolabeled compound, the percentage of the original dose transported in the brain or CSF can be determined. Furthermore, autoradioluminography of cryosections containing brain tissues with a wide range of radioactivity concentrations can be readily quantified to determine brain levels of a drug.<br>
Alternatively, microdialysis offers a way to remove drugs from the brain. The principle of microdialysis is based on the diffusion of molecules through small-diameter pores of a semi permeable membrane tubing connected to a probe that is implanted into a defined brain area. The probe is connected to a perfusion pump and perfused with a liquid, which equilibrates with the fluid outside the tube by diffusion in both directions. A quantitative<br>
analysis of drug in the fraction-collected microdialysates reflects their concentration in the fluid.<br>

A.	Stability in water, at pH: 1.5 and PBS<br>
Stability of exemplary compounds was determined in water, aqueous acidic solution (pH 1.5, HCI) and PBS (phosphate buffered saline) solution using ESI-MS (electrospray ionization mass spectrometry) as the detecting instruments. In general a 2 µg/mL pro-drug solution containing 1 µg/ml IS (internal standard) was prepared and incubated for 60 min. For water stability the incubation was performed at room temperature and for stability in acidic solution and in buffer. The incubation temperature was 37 °C. Samples were analyzed for prodrug content at time points 0 and 60 min. using MS. The % changes in peak area ratio after 60 minutes for each test compound tested are calculated using the average values from six replicate runs. The compounds tested included Compounds A1 to A19, Compounds B5 and B6 and Compounds C1 to C26. Except for C26 which was found unstable at pH 1.5 and in PBS, all other compounds were judged to be stable under all conditions tested with less than about 15%-20% concentration change after 60 minutes.<br>

Microsomal stability of Compounds A1, A2, A3, C17, C18 and C19 was determined in duplicate, in presence of pooled mouse or human liver microsomes for up to 60 minutes at 37oC. Briefly, microsomes were diluted to achieve a concentration of 1.0 mg/mL in PBS buffer (pH 7.4) containing 3 mM MgCI2 and 1 mM EDTA. Compounds (10 µM) and<br>
microsomes were pre-incubated for a period of 5 minutes before the enzymatic reaction was started by addition of co-factors (1 mM NADPH- and 2 mM UDPGA in PBS buffer). After a 1-hour incubation period, the reaction was stopped by the addition of ice cold acetonitrile. For time 0 samples, the reaction was stopped with acetonitrile before the addition of the co-factors. Analysis of extracted samples was achieved using HPLC with MS detection. Several types of HPLC columns and mobile phases were used depending of the polarity of the compound. The compound stability was determined by the % of compound remaining at 60 minutes (peak response of compound at 60 minutes / peak response at 0 minutes x 100). Four of the compounds tested (three amino acid prodrugs A1, A2, A3, and the carbamatc prodrug C19) were found stable, with over 90% of the compounds remaining after 60 minutes in presence of mouse or human microsomes (data not shown). Compound C17 was found less stable with between 20 and 35% of the prodrug remaining after 60 minutes in presence of mouse or human microsomes, while carbamate C18 showed moderate stability with between 75 and 80% of the prodrug remaining under the same conditions.<br>
C.       Mouse and human whole blood stability<br>
Test compounds were incubated for a total of 240 minutes at 37 °C in whole mouse and whole human blood. The compounds were added at time-point 0 and sample aliquots were withdrawn at each time point (usually 0, 60 and 240 minutes). The samples were extracted using protein precipitation. Analysis of extracted samples was achieved using HPLC with MS detection. Several types of HPLC columns and mobile phase were used depending of the polarity of the compound. The compound stability was determined by the % of compound remaining at 240 minutes (peak response of compound at 240 minutes / peak response at 0 minutes x 100).

Example 3: Pharmacokinetics In mice<br>
A. Bioavailability of exemplary compounds<br>
Selected exemplary compounds were tested for bioavailability in mice. Bioavailability estimates are performed for SAPS after administration of molar equivalent the selected compounds. At a specific time point following drug administration, one blood sample (approximately 1 ml) is collected from each of 3 animals from the inferior vena cava. The animals are anesthetized with isoflurane before blood collection (approximately 45 sec). Samples are collected at 5, 30, 60, 120, 180, 240 and 360 min post intravenous administration and at 15, 30, 60, 120, 180, 240 and 360 min post oral administration. One animal is used to obtain a baseline sample (pre-dose sample). Blood samples are collected into Sarstedt™ micro tubes (EDTA KE / 1.3ml), kept on ice until centrifugation at 4°C at a fninimum speed of 3000 rpm (1620G) for 10 min. Plasma samples are transferred into Eppendorf™ tubes, immediately placed on dry ice and stored at -80°C. Plasma samples are stored frozen at -20o0 pending analysis.<br>
Compounds in mouse plasma are extracted using protein precipitation. Quantitation of 3APS in mouse plasma matrix is achieved using LC-MS detection. Sample concentration is calculated using a calibration curve. Bioavailability results are summarized in Table 9.<br>

Example 4A: Metabolic Profiling of 14C-3APS in Mice. Rats and Doas<br>
Three single dose studies were conducted in mice, rats and dogs to determine the metabolic profile of 14C-3APS in plasma, urine and feces. In the first study, twenty-seven male CD-1 mice received a single dose of 100 mg/kg (20 fiCi/animal) of 1"C-3APS by oral gavge. Blood samples (3 animals/time point) were collected for 12 hr following drug<br>
administration while urine and feces (3 animals/time point) samples were collected for 96 hr. In the second study, eight male Sprague-Dawley rats received a single dose of 100 mg/kg (50 µCi/animal) of 14C-3APS by oral gavage while in the third study, three male Beagle dogs received a single dose of 100 mg/kg (30 µCi/kg) of 14C-3APS by oral gavage. For the rat and dog studies, blood samples were collected for 24 hr following drug administration while urine and feces samples were collected for 72 hr. All samples were analyzed for total radioactivity using appropriate sample preparation procedures and scintillation counting. Plasma and urine samples were also analyzed for 3APS and 3APS metabolites (2-carboxyethanesulfonic acid, 3-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonic acid and 3-acetylamino-l-propanesulfonic acid) concentrations using qualified HPLC and MS/MS methods.<br>
Following oral administration of 100 mg/kg 14C-3APS to mice and rats, mean maximum plasma concentrations of total radioactivity and 3APS were reached at approximately 30 minutes post-dose (Table 11). Thereafter, plasma concentrations of total radioactivity and 3APS declined in a multi-phasic manner with apparent terminal half-lives of approximately 2 and 6 h for mice and rats, respectively. Mean maximum plasma concentration of 2-carboxyethanesulfonic acid was achieved at 120 to 240 h post-dose. Thereafter, plasma concentrations declined in a multi-phasic manner with an apparent terminal half-life of approximately 2h and 4h for mice and rats, respectively.<br>
Following oral administration of 100 mg/kg 14C-3APS to dogs, maximum plasma concentration of total radioactivity and 3APS were reached at approximately 30 minutes post-dose, whereas maximum plasma concentration of 2-carboxyethanesulfonic acid was achieved at 720 minutes post-dose (Table 11). Thereafter, plasma concentrations of total radioactivity and 3APS declined in a multi-phasic manner. The mean apparent terminal half-lives were approximately 35 h and 5 h for total radioactivity and 3APS, respectively.<br>
For all species, the majority of total radioactivity was associated with 3APS and 2-carboxyethanesulfonic acid (Table 12). Based on AUC0-∞, values, 3APS accounted for approximately 60% of total radioactivity while 2-carboxyethanesulfonic acid accounted for 30% in mice and rats. In dogs, 3APS accounted for approximately 54% of total radioactivity while 2-carboxyethanesulfonic acid accounted for approximately 67%. 3APS and 2-carboxyethanesulfonic acid AUCo-oo constituted approximately 90% (mouse and rat) and approximately 121% (dog) of the total radioactivity indicating that 2-carboxyethanesulfonic acid is the major metabolite of 3APS in the mouse, rat and dog.<br>
For all species, total radioactivity was quantitatively recovered in urine and feces with approximately 75 to 90% of the administered dose recovered in 72 h (rat and dog) or 96 h (mouse). The major route of excretion of total radioactivity was via urine.<br>
On average, 60% of the dose was excreted in urine as total radioactivity in all species. Based on the total amount of radioactivity excreted in urine, approximately 30% was excreted as 3APS while 2-carboxyethanesulfonic acid accounted for another 63% to 77% in mouse and dog. In rats, 3APS and 2-carboxyethanesulfonic acid accounted for 59% and 62% of total radioactivity, respectively. On average the two metabolites 3-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonic acid and 3-acetylamino-1 -propanesulfonic acid represented less than 3% of the total radioactivity in all species (Table 11). The urinary cumulative amount of 3APS and 2-carboxyethanesulfonic acid accounted for approximately 90 to 110% of that determined for total radioactivity, once again suggesting that 2-carboxyethanesulfonic acid is the major metabolite of 3APS in the mouse, rat and dog.<br>

Example 4B: Absorption. Excretion and Plasma Kinetics of "C-3APS in humans<br>
Following the identification of 3APS metabolites, plasma and urine samples from this human AME study were reanalyzed for 3APS and 3APS metabolite (2-carboxyethanesulfonic acid, 3-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonic acid and 3-acetylamino-l-propanesulfonic acid) concentrations using qualified HPLC and MS/MS methods to determine the metabolic profile of 14C-3APS in human.<br>
Following oral administration of 14C-3APS to healthy subjects, maximum plasma concentration of total radioactivity and 3APS were reached at approximately 1 to 1.25 hours post-dose, whereas maximum plasma concentration of 2-carboxyethanesulfonic acid was achieved at 6.5 hours. In plasma, the majority of total radioactivity was associated with 3APS and 2-carboxyethanesulfonic acid. Based on AUCo-t values, 3APS accounted for approximately 48% of total radioactivity while 2-carboxyethanesulfonic acid accounted for 49%. 3APS and 2-carboxyethanesulfonic acid AUC0t constituted approximately 97% of the total radioactivity indicating that 2-carboxyethanesulfonic acid is the major metabolite of 3APS in human plasma.<br>
Based on the total amount of radioactivity excreted in urine, approximately 15% was excreted as 3APS while 2-carboxyethanesulfonic acid accounted for another 79%. The urinary cumulative amount of 3APS and 2-carboxyethanesulfonic acid accounted for approximately 94% of that determined for total radioactivity, once again suggesting that 2-carboxyethanesulfonic acid is the major metabolite of 3APS.<br>
Example 4C: Comparative Pharmacokinetic parameters of 3APS and 2-carboxyethanesulfonic acid following a single Oral and IV administration of "C-3APS to rats<br>
The purpose of this study was to investigate the absorption, metabolism and excretion profiles of 14C-3APS following a single intravenous bolus and oral administration to rats. Thirty-six male Sprague-Dawley rats received a single 100 mg/kg (~ 50 µCi/animal) dose of 14C-3APS by an IV bolus injection (water or isotonic saline solution) and an additional 36 male rats received the same dose level by oral gavage (in water). Blood, urine, feces, brain and CSF samples were collected for up to 72 hr following dose administration. Plasma, urine, brain and CSF concentrations of 3APS and 2-carboxyethanesulfonic acid (3APS major metabolite) were measured using LC and MS/MS detection method. Plasma, urine, feces, brain and CSF samples were analyzed for total radioactivity using appropriate sample preparation procedures and scintillation counting.<br>
Based on AUCo-=o values, after IV administration, 3APS accounted for 89% of total radioactivity and 2-carboxyethanesulfonic acid only about 9%. On the other hand, after oral administration, 3APS accounted for about 68% of total radioactivity and 2-carboxyethanesulfonic acid about 26%. Using those data, it is possible to calculate a metabolite-to-parent ratio of the exposure of about 0.1 following IV administration and a ratio of 0.38 following oral administration. This higher metabolite-to-parent ratio of the exposure following oral administration when compared to IV is consistent with an intestinal first-pass metabolism.<br>

Example 4D: Comparative Pharmacokinetic parameters of 3APS and 2-carboxvethanesulfonic acid Following a Single Oral, Intravenous and Portal administration of 3APS in rats<br>
The purpose of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetic profile of 3APS following a single dose administration either orally, intravenously or into the portal vein to male Sprague-Dawley rats. The oral, intravenous and portal routes of administration were selected to determine the intestinal and hepatic first-pass effects in the rat. Three groups of 4 male Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to receive a single dose of 250 mg/kg 3APS by<br>
different routes of administration. One group received 3APS as an IV bolus administration (in water or isotonic saline solution), one group by oral gavage (in water) and the last group via a catheter into the portal vein (in water or isotonic saline solution). Blood samples were collected for 24 hours following dose administration. Plasma concentrations of 3APS and 2-carboxyethanesulfonic acid (the major metabolite of 3APS) were determined using LC and MS/MS method.<br>
Following oral administration, maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) were generally reached within 1 hour for 3APS and its bioavailability based on the ADC,,, was calculated to be about 38%.<br>
The results obtained confirmed that there is an important metabolism of 3APS. More particularly, based on a comparison between the systemic exposures following hepatoportal and intravenous administrations, metabolism of 3APS associated with hepatic first-pass was estimated to be 24%. By comparison between the systemic exposures following oral and hepatoportal administrations, metabolism of 3APS associated with intestinal first-pass was estimated to be 43%. This study also showed that the oral administration of 3APS generated 50% more metabolite than the intravenous administration which is consistent with an intestinal first-pass metabolism.<br>
Example 5: In vitro metabolism of 3APS in primary rat neuron culture and organotypic hippocampal slice culture<br>
The metabolism of 3APS was also studied in vitro in different types of cellular models. In some cases, the metabolism of 3APS was compared with that of y-amino butyric acid (GABA).<br>
The results obtained demonstrated that incubation of 3APS (400 µM) in primary rat neuron culture media produced 2-carboxyethanesulfonic acid as a metabolite. The conversion of 3APS to 2-carboxyethanesulfonic acid was time-dependent and cell concentration-dependent. Incubation of 3APS (400 µM initial concentration) for six days in the cell .culture media (containing 800,000 cells) produced with 48 µM of 2-carboxyethanesulfonic acid. Under the same experimental conditions, 5.4µM succinic acid was detected starting from GABA (400 µM initial concentration).<br>
The conversion of 3APS to 2-carboxyethanesulfonic acid in the primary neuron culture media was significantly inhibited by vigabatrin, the latter a classic GABA transaminase inhibitor. Nialamide, a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, also reduced the formation of 2-carboxyethanesulfonic acid (from 3APS) but to a lesser extent. In contrast,<br>
different routes of administration. One group received 3APS as an IV bolus administration (in water or isotonic saline solution), one group by oral gavage (in water) and the last group via a catheter into the portal vein (in water or isotonic saline solution). Blood samples wore<br>

collected for 24 hours following dose administration. Plasma concentrations of 3APS and 2-carboxyethanesulfonic acid (the major metabolite of 3APS) were determined using LC and MS/MS method.<br>

gabapentin (known to increase GABA concentration in the brain) had no significant effect on the conversion of 3APS to 2-carboxyethanesulfonic acid.<br>
In another in vitro model employing organotypic hippocampal slice culture, the conversion of 3APS to 2-carboxyethanesulfonic acid was time-dependent. More than 60% of 3APS was converted to 2-carboxyethanesulfonic acid after 3-day incubation in the culture media. 2-carboxyethanesulfonic acid was also detected after incubation of 3APS in human hepatocyte (HepG2) culture media.<br>
