				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention particularly relates to a novel 14 member homolougous series of azoxy<br>
compounds and a simple, cheap, and environmentally friendly synthetic methodology<br>
employed to reach the same. More specifically, the members of the presently invented<br>
series of azoxy compounds exhibit a wide mesophase range. The invention particularly<br>
relates to these azoxy compounds as represented hereunder by the Formula I and also to<br>
a simple and cost-effective manner of its manufacture<br>
 <br>
wherein<br>
R represents CH3 to C14H29; a 14 member homologous series of the new azoxy liquid<br>
crystalline compounds.<br>
The present invention thus favours providing a 14 member set of liquid crystalline<br>
compounds having a wide mesophase range that would be stable upto a temperature of<br>
280 °C for wide industrial application and use including formulating substances for<br>
display devices which can be operated under extreme conditions such as in deserts and<br>
the like.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Aromatic azoxy compounds are key materials for electronic display devices based on<br>
their mesomorphic properties. This invention relates to the ester-azoxy compounds and<br>
more particularly to the ester-azoxy compounds having a nematic liquid crystal phase.<br>
thereby improving liquid crystal display elements including the compositions.<br>
 <br>
Liquid crystal display devices have many advantages over a luminescence-type display.<br>
The liquid crystal display unit including the driver circuit is small and flat, can be driven<br>
at low voltage by a small power source and provide a visual display which is far superior<br>
to the luminescence-type display. In view of these advantages, liquid crystal display<br>
devices have become widely used for computer terminals, POS terminals, video displays<br>
and the like in place of conventional cathode ray tubes. Liquid crystal materials used in<br>
liquid crystal display cells are generally of the nematic type.<br>
It is generally known that nematic liquid crystal compounds are characteristic in that the<br>
electro-optical effect, such as light-scattering, double refraction and the like, changes<br>
greatly under the influence of an electric field. In view of these characteristics, nematic<br>
liquid crystals are used widely for liquid crystal display devices based on various display<br>
principles.<br>
The particular characteristics required of a liquid crystal material in order to be utilized in<br>
the above mentioned display principles differ from each other. However, several<br>
conditions are required to for all of them. First, the material must be chemically stable,<br>
secondly it must be in the nematic state over a wide range of temperature and thirdly, the<br>
method of synthesis of such compound should be cost-effective, convenient and<br>
environment friendly. There has been a continuing need in the art to achieve such form of<br>
liquid crystal materials which would meet the above requirements of the art<br>
As regards the angle of mesophase range, it is known that the maximum mesophase<br>
range of 47.8 °C is observed for [C6H13-O-Ph-N(O)=N-Ph-0-C6H13] of the closest known<br>
azoxy derivative series [R-O-Ph-N(O)=N-Ph-O-R]. It is noteworthy to mention that<br>
C2H5-SOC-Ph-N=N(O)-Ph-COS-C2H5 and C7H15-OOC-CH=CH-Ph-N N(O)-Ph-<br>
CH=CH-COO-C7H15 from two different azoxy series which show maximum thermal<br>
ranges 111.4 °C and 100.5 °C respectively.<br>
 <br>
From the synthesis point of view of these liquid crystalline azoxy compounds, the known<br>
synthetic routes to prepare the symmetrical 4,4'-n-dialkyl/aikyloxyazoxybenzene.s are the<br>
oxidation of the corresponding 4,4'-n-dialkyl/alkyloxy azobenzenes (Scheme 1).<br>
electrochemical reduction of 4-(n-alkyloxybenzoyloxy)-4'-nitrobenzene by<br>
electrochemical method (Scheme 2) and oxidation of the 4-n-alkoxy anilines using 30%<br>
hydrogen peroxide (Scheme 3).<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
The disadvantages associated with all the above processes are that they suffer from:<br>
a)	Multiple steps<br>
b)	Prolonged reaction time<br>
c)	Multiple products that prevent easy separation<br>
 <br>
It would be clearly apparent from the above that there remain two types of basic-<br>
problems associated with the liquid crystalline known azoxy homologues:<br>
i)	Absence of liquid crystalline azoxy compounds having a wide mesophase<br>
range,<br>
ii) Absence of simple, cheap and environment friendly synthetic method for the<br>
synthesis of such compounds.<br>
There thus is a continuous need in the art to provide liquid crystalline azoxy compounds<br>
having a wide mesophase range with a relatively cheap synthetic pathway.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore a primary object of this invention to provide for liquid crystalline azoxy<br>
compounds having a broad mesomorphic range covering temperatures above and below<br>
room temperature.<br>
Another object of the present invention is directed to provide for liquid crystalline azoxy<br>
compound and liquid crystal composition including the same as a dopant or when used<br>
as a base of a liquid crystal material would improve or increase the liquid crystal<br>
temperature range or in other words will have the widest range of mesophases at a cost-<br>
effective manner of producing the same for wide and diverse applications and end uses.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide cost-effective and easy synthesis liquid<br>
crystalline azoxy compounds having a broad mesomorphic range covering temperatures<br>
above and below room temperature..<br>
 <br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide novel ester-azoxy compounds<br>
having a broad mesomorphic range covering temperatures above and below room<br>
temperature.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide for selective members of a new<br>
homologous series of liquid crystalline bis-[4-(n-alkyloxybenzoyloxy)phenyl]diazene<br>
oxides which are 14 members of the homologous series having carbon numbers 1-14 in<br>
the alkoxy chain which would have the widest range of mesophases.<br>
It is a further object of the invention to provide the ester azoxy compounds with a high<br>
clearing temperature and mesophase stability temperature of 280 °C which is rare for the<br>
azoxy derivatives of other homologous series.<br>
Still another object of the invention is to provide a synthetic methodology of the novel<br>
azoxy compounds of the present invention.<br>
Still another object of the invention is to provide a more economic, single step and<br>
environment friendly synthetic transformation leading to these novel azoxy compounds.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide the novel azoxy compounds which mabe used to formulate mixtures that will be useful to display devices to be operated in<br>
extreme temperature conditions such as in desert.<br>
Still other objects and advantages of the invention will in part be obvious and in part be<br>
apparent from the specification.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Thus according to the basic aspect of the present invention, there is provided a new group<br>
of azoxy compound having the general Formula I ; [R-O-Ph-COOPh-N(O) N-Ph-<br>
OOC-Ph-O-R] as depicted below by a novel synthetic methodology as outlined in<br>
Scheme I:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
The present invention leads over others in two aspects:<br>
i) Mesophase range ii) Synthesis<br>
The presently invented series of mesogens exhibit a larger mesophase range compared to<br>
the corresponding members of the homologous series of the other azoxy derivatives. The<br>
mesophases are stable up to around 280 °C which is rare for the other azoxy derivatives<br>
of other homologous series<br>
 <br>
The starting material used in the above synthesis i.e. the 4-(n-alkyloxybenzoyloxy)-4'-<br>
nitrobenzene was synthesized following the procedure as shown in Scheme 11 hereunder:<br>
 <br>
The above schemes I and II clearly reveal the advantages residing in the synthesis of this<br>
new 14 member homologous series of liquid crystalline bis-[4-(n-<br>
alkyloxybenzoyloxy)phenyl]diazene oxides and the merits of such synthetic method as<br>
follows:<br>
a)	Handling is very easy and safe<br>
b)	Low cost due to cheap reagents like ammonium chloride and zinc duct and also<br>
aqueous ethanol as solvent<br>
c)	Solvent system of ethanol and water mix is environment friendly<br>
d)	One step conversion<br>
e)	Single product which is purified by recrystallisation<br>
Thus the above invention relates to the provision and synthesis of a new group of azoxy<br>
compounds by a simple, cheap and green method and encompassing a wider mesophase<br>
 <br>
range, more specifically exhibiting nematic phase over a wide range of temperature. This<br>
group of compounds has a very high potential for wide application based on their wide<br>
thermal range of nematic phase. These novel ester-azoxy compounds having the general<br>
Formula I; [R-O-Ph-COO-Ph-N(O)=N-Ph-OOC-Ph-O-R] serve better than many prior<br>
art compounds with the known azoxy core [R-O-Ph-N(O)=N-Ph-O-R] in terms of<br>
possessing a wider mesophase range and a simple synthetic pathway.<br>
Preferably, the protocol followed for quantitative testing of the liquid crystalline<br>
behaviour of these novel compounds as its end characteristics are through Optical<br>
Polarising Microscopy, Differential Scanning Calorimetry and Small Angle Xray<br>
Diffraction method.<br>
Further, these materials can be used as a base component to develop a wide range of<br>
commercial liquid crystal mixture since these materials have a wide range of mesophase.<br>
With a high clearing temperature of 280 °C these compounds may be used to formulate<br>
mixtures that will be useful for display devices to be operated in extreme temperature<br>
conditions such as, in deserts.<br>
The details of the invention its objects and advantages are explained hereunder in greater<br>
detail in relation to non-limiting exemplary illustrations as per the following Examples:<br>
EXAMPLES:<br>
Example I: Synthesis of Starting materials:<br>
Synthesis of the starting materials, 4-(n-alkyloxybenzoyloxy)-4'-nitroben/ene was done<br>
as shown schematically in Scheme 11 above. n-Alkoxybenzoic acids were prepared by<br>
usual technique. Other required chemicals viz. 4nitrophenol, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide<br>
 <br>
(DCC), N, N dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) were purchased from E. Merck Ltd., India<br>
and used without further purification.<br>
4-(p-alkyloxybenzoyloxy)-4'-nitrobenzene:<br>
All the 4-(n-alkyloxybenzoyIoxy)-4'-nitrobenzenes were synthesized following the same<br>
procedure.<br>
A mixture of 4-octyloxy benzoic acid (2 g; 7.96 mmol), 4-nitrophenol (1.12 g; 7.96<br>
mmol), dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) (1.64 g: 7.96 mmol) and N, N-<br>
dimethylaminopyridine (0.1 g; 0.79 mmol) in 25 mL of dichloromethane was stirred at<br>
room temperature for 12 h. The reaction mixture was filtered off and the solution<br>
evaporated under reduced pressure. The solid was crystallized from ethanol. filtered and<br>
dried under vacuum. A very pale yellow solid was obtained. (Yield: 2.5 g: 85 %).<br>
Example II: Synthesis of bis-[4-(naIkyloxybenzoyloxy)phenyl] diazene oxides<br>
For the purpose the synthesis the starting materials, 4-(n-alkyloxybenzoyloxy)-4'-<br>
nitrobenzenes, was used as obtained above under Example I as per Scheme II.<br>
Ammonium chloride and zinc dust were purchased from E. Merck Ltd., India and were<br>
used without further purification.<br>
All the bis-[4-(nalkyloxybenzoyloxy)phenyl] diazene oxides were synthesized following<br>
the same procedure. As a representative case, the synthesis of bis-[4-(n-<br>
octyloxybenzoyloxy)phenyl] diazene oxide is given below.<br>
To a solution of 4-(n-octyloxybenzoyloxy)-4'-nitrobenzene (3.71 g; 10 mmol) in a<br>
mixture (100 mL) of ethanol and water (9:1 v/v), warmed to 333 °K, ammonium chloride<br>
 <br>
(1.07 g; 20 mmol) was added. Further heating was stopped and zinc powder (1.96 g; 30<br>
mmol) was added to the reaction mixture very slowly over 10 minutes with stirring. The<br>
reaction mixture was further stirred for lh. The resulting reaction mixture was diluted<br>
with equal volume of cold water and then filtered. The yellow residue was extracted with<br>
dichloromethane. Evaporation of the solvent afforded the novel compound of Formula I<br>
as very pale yellow solid. The resulting compound was purified by recrystallization from<br>
dichloromethane and ethanol (1:5 v/v), (Yield: 1.83 g; 52.80%). (Scheme I)<br>
The phase transition temperatures (°C) for bis [4-(n-alkyoxybenzoyloxy)phenyl]diazene<br>
oxides (Compounds 1-1 to 1-14) obtained as above were next tested and the results are<br>
provided hereunder in Table 1:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
<br>
All the members of this family show thermotropic mesogenic behaviour over a<br>
good temperature range, which is wider than that of the corresponding member of<br>
bis-(4-alkyloxyphenyl)diazene oxides.<br>
2)	Compounds 1-2 to 1-7 show nematic phase on melting up to isotropic temperature.<br>
On reversal cooling (below isotropic temperature) the nematic phase remains upto<br>
crystallization temperature.<br>
3)	Compounds 1-9 to 1-13 show smectic phase followed by nematic phase upto<br>
isotropic temperature. The nematic phase enters into smectic phase on reverse<br>
cooling and continues upto solidification temperature.<br>
4)	Compound 1-14 shows only nematic phase.<br>
5)	Interestingly the mesogenic behaviour of compound 1-1, the lowest member of the<br>
series, is similar to that of compounds 1-9 to 1-13<br>
6)	The mesogenic behaviour of 1-8 is unique within this series. Compound 1-8 shows<br>
only nematic phase on heating, but it shows nematic phase followed by smectic<br>
phase during cooling.<br>
7)	The maximum thermal range is 168.6 °C for 1-10 and the minimum thermal range<br>
is 75.8 °C for 1-3. Therefore, the members of this series exhibit very wide range<br>
of mesophase.<br>
It is thus possible by way of the present invention to provide for the liquid crystalline<br>
homologues having a wide mesophase range and also involving a simple , cost-effective<br>
and environment friendly synthetic method for the synthesis of such compounds.<br>
Advantageously the compounds according to the invention which have a clearing<br>
temperature as high as about 280°C would favour its use in display devices especially<br>
those required to be operated under extreme conditions such as in desert and favour a<br>
wide industrial application in the related field.<br>
