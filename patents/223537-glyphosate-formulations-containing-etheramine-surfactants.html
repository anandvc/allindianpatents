shown wherein the surfactant is an ethoxylated N-methyl cocoammoniura chloride surfactant having 2 moles of EO.<br>
A drawback of ethoxylated tertiary alkylamine surfactants of prior art is that when included in concentrate formulations at levels consistent with good herbicidal performance, they tend to be irritant to eyes.  In some, but not all, cases, eye irritancy can be reduced by converting the tertiary alkylamine to the corresponding quaternary (N-methyl) alkylamine.  U.S. Patent No. 5,317,003 to Kassebaum discloses that a glyphosate composition containing as the surfactant an ethoxylated N-methyl cocoammonium chloride surfactant having 15 moles of EO is less irritant to eyes than an otherwise identical composition wherein the surfactant is an ethoxylated tertiary cocoamine surfactant having 15 moles of EO.<br>
An alternative solution to the eye irritancy problem is suggested in U.S. Patent No. 5,118,444 to Nguyen, wherein ethoxylated tertiary alkylamine surfactants are converted to their N-oxides.  Examples are shown of glyphosate compositions wherein the surfactant is an ethoxylated tallowamine oxide surfactant having 10, 15 or 20 moles of EO.<br>
A further drawback of ethoxylated tertiary alkylamine surfactants of the prior art is that when water is added to them, they tend to form a stiff gel which adds to the complexity and expense of manufacturing formulations containing such surfactants, by making it difficult to clean vessels and pipes.  In practice, this problem is ameliorated by adding an anti-gelling agent, such as polyethylene glycol, to the surfactant.<br>
Never previously disclosed as components of concentrate glyphosate formulations are alkoxylated tertiary or quaternary etheramine or etheramine oxide surfactants.  United Kingdom Patent No. 1,588,079 to Texaco Development Corporation discloses examples of ethoxylated alkyloxyisopropylamine and<br><br>
alkylpoly(isopropyl)amine surfactants and methods of preparing them, and suggests they are useful as detergents, dispersants, wetting agents and emulsifiers. Surfactants disclosed have the representative chemical structure<br><br>
wherein Ra is C8-Cl8 alkyl, m is a number from 1 to 5, and x and y are average numbers such that x+y is in the range from 2 to 20.<br>
Tomah Products, Inc. of Milton, Wisconsin in a brochure titled "Ethoxylated Amines", dated August 22, 1994, disclose, together with a series of ethoxylated tertiary alkylamines, a number of ethoxylated tertiary etheramine surfactants having the representative chemical structure<br><br>
wherein Rj is C10-C26 alkyl and x and y are average numbers such that x+y is in the range from 2 to 15. Suggested uses of the Tomah ethoxylated amines include "agricultural adjuvants", a well-known application of the ethoxylated tertiary alkylamines listed.  No suggestion is made that the ethoxylated tertiary etheramines included in the list would have advantages over the ethoxylated tertiary alkylamines as agricultural adjuvants, nor is there any teaching relevant to the making of concentrate glyphosate compositions with ethoxylated tertiary etheramines.<br>
Another brochure from Tomah Products titled "Quaternaries", dated September 1, 1994, includes in a list of quaternary amine surfactants a number of ethoxylated quaternary etheramines having the<br><br>
representative chemical structure<br><br>
wherein Ra is an aliphatic group exemplified by isodecyl or isotridecyl and x+y is 2.  The list of suggested uses for Toman' s quaternaries does not include agricultural adjuvants.<br>
Another brochure from Tomah Products titled "ACâ€”14-2", dated August 24, 1994, discloses an ethoxylated etheramine oxide which can be deduced to have the representative chemical structure<br><br>
wherein Rx  is an aliphatic group exemplified by isodecyl and x+y is 2.  The list of suggested uses for AO-14-2 does not include agricultural adjuvants.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide novel compositions of glyphosate herbicide containing an etheramine surfactant which imparts good herbicidal efficacy, yet having low irritancy to eyes.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide the commercial formulator of glyphosate with an alternative to ethoxylated alkylamine surfactants that (1) allows elimination or substantial reduction of the need for the use of an anti-gelling agent, (2) is soluble in aqueous formulations having higher glyphosate acid equivalent loadings than prior art formulations having comparable efficacy, and (3) provides herbicidal efficacy superior to that obtainable with comparable amounts of said ethoxylated alkylamine surfactants having similar degrees of ethoxylation.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to<br><br>
provide concentrate liquid and dry formulations of glyphosate with an etheramine surfactant having good storage stability.<br>
These and other objectives are satisfied by the compositions disclosed herein.<br>
flOHM&amp;HY   Of   THE   IWnWTTOM<br>
There are provided new herbicidal compositions comprising glyphosate or a salt thereof and an etheramine surfactant, defined as an amine surfactant in which the hydrophobe is connected to the amine group via a series of up to about 10 oxyalkylene groups.<br>
Specifically, the etheramine surfactant may be a<br><br><br>
are average numbers such that x+y is in the range from 0 to about 60, and A" is an agriculturally acceptable anion.<br>
As a third possibility, the etheramine surfactant nay be an amine oxide having the representative chemical structure<br><br>
wherein F^ is a straight or branched chain C6 to about C22 alkyl, aryl or alkylaryl group, m is an average number from l to about 10, R2 in each of the m (0-R2) groups is independently C1-C4 alkylene, R3 groups are independently C^-C^ alkylene, and x and y are average numbers such that x+y is in the range from 2 to about 60.<br>
Compositions of the invention may be prepared on site by the end-user shortly before application to the foliage of vegetation to be killed or controlled, by mixing in aqueous solution a glyphosate containing composition and a composition comprising a surfactant having a chemical structure encompassed by those represented immediately above.  Such compositions of the invention are referred to herein as "tank-mix" compositions.<br>
Alternatively, compositions of the invention may be provided to the end-user already formulated, either at the desired dilution for application ("ready to use" compositions) or requiring dilution, dispersion or dissolution in water by the end-user ("concentrate" compositions).  Such preformulated compositions of the invention are storage-stable and may be liquid or dry.<br>
A method of use of compositions of the invention to kill or control weeds or other unwanted vegetation is also provided.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Compositions of the invention may contain<br><br>
glypbosate in its acid form.  However, because of the relatively low solubility of glyphosate acid in water, more soluble salts of glyphosate are generally preferred. As in commercial compositions of prior art, an especially preferred salt for aqueous compositions of the invention is the isopropylamine salt of glyphosate, while an especially preferred salt for dry compositions of the invention is the ammonium salt. Many other salts may be used either in aqueous or in dry formulations, including but not restricted to aIky1amine, such as dimethylamine and n-propylamine, alkanolamine, such as monoethanolamine, alkylsulfonium, such as trimethylsulfonium, and alkali metal, such as sodium and potassium, salts of glyphosate.  Regardless of whether acid or a salt is used, it is generally preferred to refer to the amount of glyphosate applied or contained in a formulation in terms of glyphosate acid equivalent, conventionally abbreviated as "a.e.".<br>
Tank-mix and ready to use compositions of the invention are aqueous solutions comprising from about l to about 50 g glyphosate a.e./l, occasionally more. A preferred range for tank-mix and ready to use compositions is from about 5 to about 20 g a.e./l.<br>
Concentrate compositions of the invention may be â–  aqueous solutions comprising from about 50 to about 500 g glyphosate a.e./l or more, preferably from about 200 to about 500 g a.e./l and most preferably from about 350 to about 500 g a.e./l. An example of an especially preferred aqueous concentrate composition of the invention contains the isopropylamine salt of glyphosate at about 360 g a.e./l, the same level as is present in commercial compositions being sold as Roundup* herbicide by Monsanto Company.<br>
A surprising advantage of aqueous compositions of the invention over prior art compositions is that the glyphosate concentration can be increased to very high levels, for example from about 450 to about 500 g a.e./l, yet the surfactant concentration is still<br><br>
adequate to give excellent herbicidal performance without the end-user requiring to add more surfactant in the spray tank. Many such highly concentrated compositions have remarkably good storage stability under a wide range of temperature conditions.<br>
Alternatively, concentrate compositions of the invention may be dry formulations, presented for example in the form of powders, pellets, tablets or, preferably, granules, to be dispersed or dissolved in water prior to use.  Typically no water-insoluble ingredients are present at substantial levels in such compositions and the formulations are therefore fully water-soluble.  Dry water-soluble or water-dispersible compositions of the invention comprise from about 20% to about 80% weight/weight glyphosate a.e., preferably from about 50% to about 76%, and most preferably from about 60% to about 72%. An example of an especially preferred water-soluble granular composition of the invention contains the ammonium salt of glyphosate at about 72% weight/weight, the same level as is present in commercial compositions being sold as Scout* herbicide by Monsanto Company.<br>
In dry compositions of the invention glyphosate may itself provide the support for other formulation ingredients, or there may additionally be present one or more inert ingredients providing such support.  An example of an inert support that may be used is ammonium sulfate.  The term "dry" as used herein does not imply that dry compositions are totally free of water; typically dry compositions of the invention comprise from about 0.5 to about 5 percent by weight, preferably less than about 1 percent by weight water.<br>
Dry water-soluble or water-dispersible granular formulations of the invention can be made by any process known in the art, including but not restricted to spray drying, fluid-bed agglomeration, pan granulation, or extrusion.  In dry formulations, glyphosate may be present as a salt, for example the sodium or ammonium<br><br>
salt, or as the acid.  Formulations containing glyphosate acid may optionally contain an acid acceptor such as an ammonium or alkali metal carbonate or bicarbonate, ammonium dihydrogen phosphate or the like, so that upon dissolution or dispersion in water by the end user a water soluble salt of glyphosate is produced.<br>
What distinguishes compositions of the invention from all previously described glyphosate compositions is the presence therein of an alkoxylated tertiary or an alkoxylated or non-alkoxylated quaternary etheramine or an alkoxylated etheramine oxide surfactant having the representative chemical structure (a)<br><br>
wherein Rj^ is a straight or branched chain C6 to about C22 alkyl, aryl or alkylaryl group, m is an average number from 1 to about 10, R2 in each of the m (0-R2) groups is independently C^-C^ alkylene, R3 groups are independently C^C^ alkylene, and x and y are average numbers such that x+y is in the range from 2 to about 60; or (b)<br><br>
wherein Rx is a straight or branched chain C6 to about C22 alkyl, aryl or alkylaryl group, m is an average number from 1 to about 10, R2 in each of the m (0-R2) groups is independently C^-C^ alkylene, R3 groups are independently C^^  alkylene, R4 is C^-C^ alkyl, x and y are average numbers such that x+y is in the range from 0 to about 60, and A" is an agriculturally acceptable anion; or (c)<br><br><br>
wherein Rj is a straight or branched chain C6 to about C22 alkyl, aryl or alkylaryl group, m is an average number from 1 to about 10, R2 in each of the m (0-R2) groups is independently Ca-C4 alkylene, R3 groups are independently Cj-c^ alkylene, and x and y are average numbers such that x+y is in the range from 2 to about 60.<br>
Alkylamine or alkylamine oxide surfactants in glyphosate compositions of prior art have no (0-R2) groups, in other words m - 0. We have found that surprisingly improved properties can be imparted to glyphosate compositions when from 1 to about 10 (0-R2) groups are inserted in the surfactant structure between the R1 group and the nitrogen atom.<br>
Aryl groups, if present in Rlf  have 5-7, preferably 6, carbon atoms and may or may not be substituted with moieties.  The alkyl portion in any alkylaryl group comprising Rx has 1-16 carbon atoms. An example of such an alkylaryl group is alkylphenyl, for example nonylphenyl.<br>
However, in preferred surfactants of the invention R2 is a straight or branched chain alkyl group having about 8 to about 18, for example about 10-15, carbon atoms, and are derived from the corresponding alcohol. For example, the alkyl group may be of natural derivation, such as from coconut or tallow, or may be /^fc^"* derived from a synthetic alcohol such as isodecyl,    / isotridecyl, linear C12-C14 or octadecyl alcohols.<br>
The R2 substituent closest to the nitrogen atom (the proximal R2 group) is in preferred examples a linear propylene (-CH2CH2CH2-), isopropylene (-CH2CH(CH3)-) or ethylene (-CH2CH2-) group.  Preferred examples where the proximal R2 group is linear propylene have m = 1. Where the proximal R2 group is isopropylene<br><br>
or ethylene, m is preferably in the range from 1 to 5, most preferably from 2 to 3, and all R2 groups are preferably the same.<br>
R3 substituents in preferred examples are independently selected from isopropylene and ethylene-in especially preferred examples all R3 groups are ethylene.  In tertiary etheramines and etheramine oxides of the invention it is preferred that x+y is in the range from 2 to about 20.  In quaternary etheramines of the invention it is preferred that x+y is in the range from 0 to about 20. A particularly preferred range for x+y in tertiary and quaternary etheramines and etheramine oxides of the invention is from 2 to about 10, more particularly from 2 to about 5.<br>
In quaternary etheramines of the invention R4 is preferably methyl and A" is preferably a halide, for example chloride or bromide, a phosphate or a sulfate ion, or alternatively may be a glyphosate ion or may be contributed by an anionic surfactant included with the etheramine in the formulation.  It will be recognized by those skilled in the art that at low pH, such as may well exist in a glyphosate formulation, tertiary etheramines will most likely be protonated at the nitrogen atom and may be associated with a counterion; in such cases the tertiary etheramine can be represented by the chemical structure shown above for a quaternary etheramine, except that R4 is hydrogen.  The counterion A" in a low pH glyphosate formulation comprising a tertiary etheramine is most likely glyphosate itself-<br>
One especially preferred surfactant useful in compositions of the invention is a tertiary etheramine having R2 = C12-C14 alkyl, R2 = isopropylene, m = 2, R3 * ethylene and x+y = 5.<br>
Another especially preferred surfactant useful in compositions of the invention is a tertiary etheramine having R^ = C12-CX4  alkyl, R2 = ethylene, m = 3, R3 = ethylene and x+y = 5.<br>
Two other especially preferred surfactants useful<br><br>
in compositions of the invention are tertiary etheramines having % = isodecyl, R2 â„¢ linear propylene, m = 1, R3 - ethylene and x+y - 2 or 5 respectively.<br>
Another series of especially preferred surfactants useful in compositions of the invention is a tertiary etheramine having R^ Â» coco alkyl, R2 = linear propylene, â–  Â» 1, R3 â–  ethylene and x+y - a number in the range from 2 to 10.<br>
Two other especially preferred surfactants useful in compositions of the invention are tertiary etheramines having Rx = isotridecyl, R2 = linear propylene, m = l, R3 * ethylene and x+y = 2 or 5 respectively.<br>
Two other especially preferred surfactants useful in compositions of the invention are quaternary etheramines having Rj = isodecyl or isotridecyl respectively, R2 = linear propylene, R3 = ethylene, R4 = methyl, m = l and x+y = 2.<br>
Any convenient and effective herbicidal activity enhancing amount of the etheramine surfactant can be used in compositions of the invention,  in tank-mix and ready to use formulations very high levels of surfactant are achievable, for example up to 5% weight/volume or even higher, but for reasons of economy it will be more normal to use a concentration in the range from about 0.125% to about 2% weight/volume.  One of ordinary skill in the art will be able to determine from tests on different plant species an appropriate level of etheramine surfactant to include for any particular glyphosate application.<br>
In concentrate liquid or dry compositions of the invention, the etheramine surfactant is preferably included at a weight/weight ratio to glyphosate a.e. in the range from about 1:20 to about 1:1, most preferably from about 1:10 to about 1:2, for example about 1:6.<br>
Long-term storage stability is an important commercial attribute of concentrate formulations.  In the case of aqueous concentrate formulations of<br><br>
glyphosate salts, it is particularly important that surfactants in the formulation do not separate from the other ingredients as a distinct phase. Many aqueous concentrates made with surfactants of prior art show a tendency for phase separation at high temperatures,  it is a feature of the etheramine surfactants herein disclosed that they show good compatibility with glyphosate salts, particularly the isopropylamine salt, as evidenced by relatively high cloud points even in aqueous solutions having high glyphosate concentrations. In general for most applications, a cloud point higher than about 50'C is desirable.<br>
In addition to glyphosate or a salt thereof and the etheramine surfactant, any of a variety of further ingredients or adjuvants may be included in formulations of the present invention, as long as such added materials are not significantly antagonistic to the glyphosate herbicidal activity.  Examples of such added materials illustratively include anti-gelling agents, antifreezes, thickeners, dyes, antimicrobial preservatives or additives to further enhance herbicidal activity, such as ammonium sulfate or fatty acids.<br>
A second surfactant of a class other than etheramines, for example a primary or secondary alcohol ethoxylate, an alkyl ester of sucrose or sorbitan, or an alkyl polyglucoside, may also be included.  When such a second surfactant is present, it is preferable that the weight/weight ratio of etheramine to the second surfactant is greater than about 1:1, most preferably greater than about 2:1, for example around 4:1.<br>
Preferably when a second surfactant is included in a highly concentrated glyphosate formulation of the invention, for example one containing about 450 to about 500 g a.e./l, the etheramine surfactant comprises at least about 75% by weight of the total surfactant present.<br>
Mixtures of glyphosate with other herbicides are also within the scope of the present invention if an<br><br>
etneramine surfactant is included in the formulation. Examples of such other herbicides include bialaphos, glufosinate, 2,4-D, MCPA, dicamba, diphenylethers, imidazolinones and sulfonylureas.<br>
Methods of use of glyphosate formulations are well known to those of skill in the art. Aqueous concentrate formulations of the invention are diluted in an appropriate volume of water and applied, for example by spraying, to the weeds or other unwanted vegetation to be killed or controlled.  Dry concentrate formulations of the invention are dissolved or dispersed in an appropriate volume of water and applied in the same way. For most purposes, compositions of the invention are applied at glyphosate a.e. rates in the range from about 0.1 to about 5 kg/ha, occasionally more.  Typical glyphosate a.e. rates for control of annual and perennial grasses and broadleaves are in the range from about 0.3 to about 1.5 kg/ha.  Compositions of the invention may be applied in any convenient volume of water, most typically in the range from about 50 to about 1000 1/ha.<br>
The present invention is illustrated by but not limited to the following Examples.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Cloud point was determined for certain liquid compositions of the Examples as follows. A sample of the composition in a test tube was heated in a water bath until it became cloudy.  The test tube was then removed from the water bath and the sample stirred with a thermometer until it became clear. The temperature at which the sample became clear was recorded as the cloud point of the composition.<br>

Example 12<br>
Comparative herbicidal efficacy was determined in a field test at Jerseyville, Illinois.  Treatments were applied post-emergence to plants which had grown from seeds planted mechanically in rows. A randomized block design with three replicates was used. Applications were made with a backpack sprayer with multiple nozzles giving an overlapping spray pattern to maximize uniformity of application. Herbicidal efficacy was evaluated as percent control estimated visually by comparison with untreated plots.<br><br>
Plant species on which herbicidal efficacy was evaluated were Japanese millet fEchinochloa crua-aalli. ECHCF), broadleaf signalgrass fBrachiaria Dlatvnhvlla. BRAPP), prickly sida (Si,da. Bpjnosa, SIDSP), redroot pigweed (Amqrantjhus retroflexus. AMARE), hemp sesbania fsesbania exaltata. SEBEX), morningglory flpomoea sp., IPOSS) and velvetleaf (AfruUlPn theophrflsU, ABUTH) .<br>

The composition can be calculated to contain, on a dry weight basis, 25% surfactant. Glyphosate assay was determined to be 61.8% a.e. Example 14<br>
The surfactant used in Example 14 is the same as that used in Example 3. The dry water-soluble granular composition of Example 14 was prepared by adding to a small food-processor bowl the following ingredients:<br>

(2)	surfactant as defined above, 12.5 g.<br>
(3)	water, 2.5 g.<br>
No gelling of the surfactant was observed.  The ingredients were mixed, forming homogeneous small granules.  The granules were dried in a fluid-bed dryer at 65*C for 15 minutes.<br>
The composition can be calculated to contain, on a dry weight basis, 25% surfactant.  Glyphosate assay was determined to be 66.2% a.e. Example IB<br>
For comparative greenhouse testing of herbicidal efficacy, aqueous concentrate compositions containing 31% glyphosate a.e. in the form of the isopropylamine salt and 5.5% surfactant were prepared by a procedure similar to that of Examples 1-4. i       Formulations CI and C2 were made using tertiary alkylamine surfactants of prior art. The surfactant in CI is an ethoxylated cocoamine having 5 moles of EO.  If the representative chemical structure shown for a<br><br>
tertiary etheramine of the invention is applied to tne surfactant of CI, it will be seen that Rx is coco alkyl of average carbon chain length about 12, m is 0, R3 is ethylene and x+y is 5.  The surfactant in C2  is an ethoxylated tallowamine having 5 moles of EO.  If the representative chemical structure shown for a tertiary etheramine of the invention is applied to the surfactant of C2, it will be seen that R2 is tallow alkyl of average carbon chain length about 18, m is 0, R3 is ethylene and x+y is 5.<br>
Formulations E1-E9 were made using tertiary or quaternary N-methyl etheramine surfactants of the invention. The chemical structures of these surfactants can be deduced from the following table, by reference to the representative structures shown above.<br><br>
For greenhouse testing, seeds of velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti. ABUTH) and Japanese millet (Echinochloa crus-qalli. ECHCP) were planted in 10.2 cm square pots of soil with added fertilizer.  Plants were allowed to grow until the desired growth stage or size (3-leaf stage for ABUTH, 20-25 cm height for ECHCF) for spraying.  Pots were selected for uniformity before treatment and four replicate pots were assigned to each treatment, including an untreated control.  Spray solutions were prepared by dilution of the concentrate glyphosate formulations in water.  Spraying was performed with a device which simulates agricultural field spraying equipment, delivering a fine spray at a pressure of about 207 kilopascals.  Speed of travel of the spray device over the plants was adjusted to give<br><br>
the desired spray volume of 187 1/ha.  For logistical reasons, all four replicates of each treatment were sprayed together. After spraying, the plants were returned to the greenhouse. Herbicidal efficacy was evaluated by visual assessment 16 days after treatment and recorded as "percent control" on an arbitrary scale by comparison with untreated plants. On this scale 0 means no visible effect and 100 means death of all plants.  In the table below, percent control values given are the means of four replicates.<br><br>

In formulations E14-E25 glyphosate is present as its isopropylamine salt at 480 g a.e./l and the total surfactant (etheramine plus nonionic surfactant) concentration is 80 g/1.  In all cases the weight/weight ratio of etheramine to the nonionic surfactant is 4:1.<br>

The etheramine surfactant in formulation E20 is the same as that in formulation E6 of Example 15. The nonionic surfactant in formulation E20 is an ethoxylated C14-c16 linear primary alcohol having an average of 7 moles of EO.<br>
The etheramine surfactant in formulation E21 is the same as that in formulation E6 of Example 15. The nonionic surfactant in formulation E21 is an ethoxylated C12"C15 secondary alcohol having an average of 9 moles of EO.<br>

Cloud points of formulations E14-E25 are shown in the table below.<br><br>
An attempt was made to make formulations similar to E14-E25, but containing, in place of the etheramine component, an ethoxylated tertiary alkylamine surfactant of prior art. Whether a cocoamine with 5 moles of EO or a tallowamine with 5 moles of EO was used, the prior art surfactant was found to be incompatible with any of the ethoxylated primary or secondary alcohol surfactants used in formulations E14-E25, at equal glyphosate, amine surfactant and nonionic surfactant loadings as in these same formulations. Thus, a further unexpected advantage of etheramine surfactants of the present invention over alkylamine surfactants of prior art is their relatively good compatibility with nonionic surfactants in highly concentrated aqueous glyphosate formulations.<br>
