				<td>BIGUANIDE PRESERVATION OF PRECIPITATED CALCIUM CARBONATE<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/287,847, filed on 18 December 2009, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] Precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) is manufactured on a commercial scale for use in a variety of industrial, cosmetic and pharmaceutical products. Generally, precipitated calcium carbonate is made by heating crushed limestone at high temperatures, breaking the raw calcium carbonate into lime (CaO) and carbon dioxide gas (CO2). Addition of the water to the lime (a process called "slaking") yields Ca(0H2). The slaked lime (or "milk of lime") is treated with carbon dioxide gas. The resulting calcium carbonate precipitates from the aqueous solution, yielding a slurry of precipitated calcium carbonate that can be neutralized, milled, filtered, dewatered and/or dried, as desired.<br>
[0003] Slurries of precipitated calcium carbonate are susceptible to microorganisms. To deter microorganisms, a preservative such an aldehyde can be added to the slurry. For example, U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2009/0088483 discloses combinations of a dialdehyde (such as glutaraldehyde) and a formaldehyde-releasing agent such as (ethylenedioxy)dimethanol. Unfortunately, these preservatives have their limitations. Glutaraldehyde, for example, is unstable at alkaline pH, and is therefore ineffective as a long-term preservative. Furthermore some bacterial strains metabolize formaldehyde (see, for example, Di Maiuta et al. (2009) Intemational Biodeterioration &amp; Biodegradation 63:769-777), permitting bacterial growth even in a treated PCC slurry.<br>
[0004] There is a need for improved preservation methods for precipitated calcium carbonate compositions.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0005] Polymeric biguanides can effectively preserve oral care compositions that include precipitated calcium carbonate. The polymeric biguanide provides lasting antimicrobial action without requiring an aldehyde-based preservative.<br>
[0006] Thus, in one aspect, a dry precipitated calcium carbonate composition for use in oral care, or in the manufacture of an oral care composition. The dry precipitated calcium carbonate composition includes, in addition to the precipitated calcium carbonate, a polymeric biguanide such as polyhexamethylene biguanide.<br>
1<br>
 <br>
[0007] Also provided are precipitated calcium carbonate slurries for use in oral care or in the manufacture of an oral care composition. The slurry includes water, precipitated calcium carbonate, and a polymeric biguanide such as polyhexamethylene biguanide. The slurry is optionally free of other preservatives, such as formaldehyde. The slurry can include one or more other oral care ingredients, such as humectants, inorganic dispersants, bicarbonate salts, pH modifying agents, surfactants, foam modulators, thickening agents, viscosity modifiers, sweeteners, flavorants, colorants, anticaries agents, anticalculus agents, stannous ion sources, zinc ion sources, breath fresheners, antiplaque agents, enzymes, vitamins, anti-adhesion agents and combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the concentration of the polymeric biguanide does not exceed 0.04%. For example, in certain embodiments the concentration is between 0.01% and 0.04%.<br>
[0008] Also provided are methods of preparing an oral care composition. The methods include combining a pre-formed complex of precipitated calcium carbonate and a polymeric biguanide such as polyhexamethylene biguanide with a composition that includes one or more oral care ingredients chosen from humectants, inorganic dispersants, bicarbonate salts, pH modifying agents, surfactants, foam modulators, thickening agents, viscosity modifiers, sweeteners, flavorants, colorants, anticaries agents, anticalculus agents, stannous ion sources, zinc ion sources, breath fresheners, antiplaque agents, enzymes, vitamins, anti-adhesion agents and combinations thereof<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0009] As used throughout, ranges are used as a shorthand for describing each and every value that is within the range. Any value within the range can be selected as the terminus of the range. In addition, all references cited herein are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties. In the event of a conflict in a definition in the present disclosure and that of a cited reference, the present disclosure controls. In addition, the compositions and the methods may comprise, consist essentially of, or consist of the elements described therein. [0010] Unless otherwise specified, all percentages and amounts expressed herein and elsewhere in the specification should be understood to refer to percentages by weight. The amounts given are based on the active weight of the material. The recitation of a specific value herein is intended to denote that value, plus or minus a degree of variability to account for errors in measurements. For example, an amount of 10% may include 9.5% or 10.5%, given the degree of error in measurement that will be appreciated and understood by those having ordinary skill in the art.<br>
2<br>
 <br>
[0011] As used herein, "antibacterial activity" herein means activity as determined by any generally accepted in vitro or in vivo antibacterial assay or test. "Ami-inflammatory activity" herein means activity as determined by any generally accepted in vitro or in vivo assay or test, for example an assay or test for inhibition of prostaglandin production or cyclooxygenase activity.<br>
[0012] As used throughout, ranges are used as a shorthand for describing each and every value that is within the range. Any value within the range can be selected as the terminus of the range. In addition, all references cited herein are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties. In the event of a conflict in a definition in the present disclosure and that of a cited reference, the present disclosure controls.<br>
[0013] Unless otherwise specified, all percentages and amounts expressed herein and elsewhere in the specification should be understood to refer to percentages by weight. The amounts given are based on the active weight of the material.<br>
[0014] An oral care composition of the present invention can contain active and/or carrier ingredients additional to those recited above. Classification herein of an ingredient as an active agent or a carrier ingredient is made for clarity and convenience, and no inference should be drawn that a particular ingredient necessarily Sanctions in the composition in accordance with its classification herein. Furthermore, a particular ingredient can serve a plurality of fimctions, thus disclosure of an ingredient herein as exemplifying one fianctional class does not exclude the possibility that it can also exemplify another fianctional class. [0015] According to the present invention, a polymeric biguanide can be added to precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) as a preservative. The biguanide is optionally added during the initial preparation of the PCC: after precipitation (e.g. from carbonation of a slaked lime) and before the initial drying. The biguanide preserves the PCC slurry during this process. Furthermore, the inventors have found that the biguanide remains associated with the PCC during this process and after drying. As such, the biguanide not only preserves the PCC, but will also preserve an oral care composition that includes the PCC/biguanide complex.<br>
[0016] Polymeric biguanides are polymeric molecules that include multiple biguanide moieties. It is understood that polymerization can generate a population of polymers that vary in size, depending on the number of subunits incorporated. The present invention uses polymeric biguanides that average at least three biguanide moieties per molecule. Generally, an average of at least five biguanide moieties per molecule are included. In certain embodiments, the average number of biguanide moieties is from 5-80, from 5-40, from 6-27,<br>
3<br>
 <br>
from 9-27, or from 11-18. The biguanide moieties are generally joined by a linker, which can include, for example, an alkyl, a substituted alkyl, a heteroalkyl, a substituted heteroalkyl, an aryl, a substituted aryl, a heteroaryl, or a substituted heteroaryl. The weight average molecular weight of the polymeric biguanide may exceed 1000 Daltons. For example, in certain embodiments, the weight average molecular weight is from 1000-15,000 Daltons; 1000-8000 Daltons; 1000-5000 Daltons; 1230-5000 Daltons; 1700-5000 Daltons; 2100-5000 Daltons; 2100-3300 Daltons; or 2340-3300 Daltons. [0017] In certain embodiments, a class of polymeric biguanides have the following formula:<br>
NH	NH<br>
s A A .u<br>
NH	NH	NH	\^^<br>
where R is an optionally substituted hydrocarbdiyl group, which may be aliphatic, araliphatic or aromatic, where n is an integer in the range of 5-80, from 5-40, from 6-27, from 9-27, or<br>
from 11-18. Examples of suitable R optionally substituted hydrocarbdiyl groups include<br>
straight- and branched- chain hydrocarbdiyl groups, such as Ci.aoalkylene, such as C3.9 alkylene (e.g. tetramethylene or hexamethylene) or Cs-g cycloalkadiyl (e.g. cyclohexa-1,4-diyl). In certain embodiments, R is of the formula: (CHi)^, where /n is an integer in the range 3-20, or in the range 3-9.<br>
[0018] One example of a suitable polymeric biguanide is poly[(hexamethylene)biguanide] (PHMB), also known as polyaminopropyl biguanide and<br>
poly(iminoimidocarbonyl)iminohexamethylene hydrochloride. PHMB is commercially available (Arch Chemicals, Inc.).<br>
[0019] The polymeric biguanide can be added to a FCC-containing composition at any time. Advantageously, the polymeric biguanide is optionally added when the FCC is initially manufactured, after the formation of the precipitate to form the FCC slurry, and before the slurry is dried. For example, after the calcium hydroxide solution is treated with an excess of carbon dioxide, forming the FCC, the resulting slurry is fairly alkaline can be neutralized using an acid such as a mineral acid (phosphoric, sulfiiric, nitric, and/or hydrochloric, for example) or an organic acid, such as acetic, propionic, or sulfonic acid. A polymeric<br>
4<br>
 <br>
biguanide in certain embodiments is added to the neutralized PCC slurry prior to drying of the slurry.<br>
[0020] In this way, the polymeric biguanide can preserve the PCC against contamination {e.g. bacterial contamination, fungal contamination, or viral contamination) from the time of its initial manufacture. Other preservatives, such as aldehyde-based preservatives, can be omitted from the FCC-containing composition, as their function is provided by the polymeric biguanide. The polymeric biguanide remains associated with the PCC during and aflter the drying process. The dried PCC-biguanide composition can be resuspended in water, again forming a biguanide preserved slurry useful in an oral care composition. [0021] The polymeric biguanide is added to a concentration sufficient to provide antimicrobial activity. Thus, although higher concentrations of polymeric biguanide could be used, concentrations no greater than 0.04% or no greater than 0.03% are used in certain embodiments. In one embodiment, the concentration of polymeric biguanide is from 0.01%-0,04%. In another embodiment, the concentration of polymeric biguanide is from 0.01% to 0.03%. In another embodiment, the concentration of polymeric biguanide is from 0.025% to 0.03%.<br>
[0022] A pre-formed PCC/biguanide complex can be used as an ingredient in an oral care composition such as a dentrifice. The oral care composition may be in the form of a paste, cream, mousse, gel, powder, wash, or the like. The oral care composition in certain embodiments includes one or more other oral care ingredients such as humectants, inorganic dispersants, bicarbonate salts, pH modifying agents, surfactants, foam modulators, thickening agents, viscosity modifiers, sweeteners, flavorants, colorants, anticaries agents, anticalculus agents, stannous ion sources, zinc ion sources, breath fresheners, antiplaque agents, enzymes, vitamins, anti-adhesion agents and combinations thereof The oral care composition optionally includes at least two, at least three, at least four, at least five, or at least six of the above other oral care ingredients. As but a few examples, the oral care composition can include a humectant; a humectant and a thickener; a humectant, a thickener and a surfactant; a humectant, a thickener, a surfactant, and a fluoride source; a humectant, a surfactant, a fluoride source, and a bicarbonate; a humectant, a surfactant, a fluoride source, a bicarbonate, and an inorganic dispersant; or a humectant, a surfactant, a fluoride source, a bicarbonate, an inorganic dispersant, and flavoring. One or more other oral care ingredients can substitute for or augment any of these ingredients. In embodiments where these oral care ingredients are combined with a pre-formed complex of the PCC bound to the polymeric biguanide, the<br>
5<br>
 <br>
combination of the polymeric biguanide with the PCC precedes their combination with the other added oral care ingredients.<br>

SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0051] The invention is further described in the following examples. The examples are merely illustrative and do not in any way limit the scope of the invention as described and claimed. Example 1.<br>
[0052] Poly[(hexamethylene)biguanide] (PHMB) is added during the PCC manufacturing process. Specifically, PHMB is added following neutralization of the newly precipitated calcium carbonate slurry wdth phosphoric acid. The slurry samples are subjected to a Micro Robustness Test (MRT), a challenge test assessing the antimicrobial efficacy of PHMB against a pool of microorganisms including:<br>
Burkholderia cepacia<br>
Enterobacter cloacae<br>
Escherichia coli<br>
Klebsiella oxytoca<br>
Klebsiella pneumoniae<br>
Serratia marcescens<br>
Providencia rettgeri<br>
Pseudomonas aeruginosa<br>
Pseudomonas putida<br>
13<br>
 <br>
Staphylococcus aureus<br>
Staphylococcus saprophyticus Samples are challenged 3 times at 30 minute intervals with an inoculum of 10^ bacteria from the above-listed pool. After 4, 6 and 24 hours, aliquots are tested to measure the log reduction of bacteria. Using these data, the area under the curve (AUC) is calculated. The results are shown in Table 1:<br>
Table 1.<br>
PC^si^	I .i^^i'^'^f'^^o.ir^ AUCNI       Z.<br>
	4h	6h         24h	<br>
With 500 ppm PHMB        7.2	7.1	7.7       111.7      1.013 (23.2°C)<br>
With 250 ppm PHMB        6.8	6.8	7.1        105.1      1.023 (22.8°C)<br>
With 1% formaldehyde       7.2	7.5	8.2        171.2      1.005 (24.3°C)<br>
Without PHMB (control)  |   1.0	|    1.1	|    1.2   |    16.8    | 1.013 (22.1°C)<br>
As is evident in the Table, even 250 ppm (0.025%) PHMB very significantly reduces the bioburden. Indeed, PCC preserved with 0.03% PHMB should exhibit antimicrobial robustness comparable to that of PCC preserved with 1.0% formaldehyde, as the 7-log reduction in 24 hours for 250 ppm PHMB is close to the 8-log reduction in 24 hours observed in 1% formaldehyde.<br>
[0053] Furthermore, it was observed that the PHMB remains associated with the PCC after the drying process. Although PHMB is water soluble, with the drying process used for PCC (a drum dryer), only water is evaporated; the PHMB remains associated with the PCC. Example 2.<br>
[0054] The PHMB-associated PCC is tested for preservative activity in a toothpaste formulation. PHMB-associated PCC is formulated into each of two toothpaste formulas (Formulas A and B) including sorbitol, carboxymethylcellulose, sodium lauryl sulfate, monofluorophosphate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium silicate, flavoring, and water and subjected to an MRT test as described in Example 1.<br>

Flavor A, and PCC preserved with PHMB; Formula B included sorbitol, sodium saccharin, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, sodium monofluorophosphate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium silicate, water, Flavor B, and PCC preserved with PHMB, Consistent with the data from Example 1, a PHMB concentration of 0.03% was confirmed to be sufficient to preserve the toothpaste formulas, providing a Micro Robustness Index (MRI) above the target level of 0.75. Furthermore, the PHMB-preserved formulation was aged at 40°C for 12 weeks and confirmed to be as well preserved as a formaldehyde-preserved formulation during its shelf life.<br>
