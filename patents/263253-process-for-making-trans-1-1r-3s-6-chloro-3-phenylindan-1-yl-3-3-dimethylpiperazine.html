				<td>PROCESS FOR MAKING TRANS-1- ((1R, 3S) - 6-CHLORO-3 -PHENYLINDAN-1-YL) -3 , 3-DIMETHYLPIPERAZiNE<br>
The present invention relates to a process for making fraw-l-((7Jf,55)-6-chloro-3-phenylindan-l-yl)-3,3-dimethylpiperazine (Compound I) and salts thereof,<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The Compound, which is the subject of the present invention (Compound I, fraras-l-((7i?,55)-6-chloro-3-phenyIindan-l-yl)-3,3-dimethylpiperazine) has the general formula (I).<br><br>
Compound I and salts thereof, including a fumarate and maleate salt thereof, and the medical uses thereof, e.g. in schizophrenia or other diseases involving psychotic Symptoms, are described in PCT/DK04/000546 (WO05/016901).<br>
As described in PCT/DK04/000546 the inventors have found that Compound I displays high affinity for dopamine (DA) Dl receptors, DA D2 receptors and for alfal adrenoceptors. Furthermore, Compound I was found to be an antagonist at dopamine Dl and D2 receptors, and at Serotonin 5-HT2a receptors. As fürther described in PCT/DK04/000546, Compound I is a relatively weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 (i.e. reduced potential for drug to drug interaction) and has a relatively low effect on the QT interval in a rabbit model (i.e. reduced potential for introducing drug-induced QT interval Prolongation and appearance of fatal cardiac arrhythmias, torsade de pointes (TdP), in humans). Additionally, the 5-HT2 antagonistic activity of Compound I suggests that Compound I may have a relatively low rislc of extrapyramidal side effects.<br><br>
The properties outlined above, e.g. binding assays (including alfa-1, DA Dl or D2 receptors), efficacy assays (including DA Dl or D2, or Serotonin 5-HT2A receptors), CYP2D6 inhibition and QT-interval maybe determined as described in PCTYDK04/000546, cf. in particular the "Example" section page 19-24 in the application text as filed for PCT/DK04/000546. D<br>
Further, the inventors have found that Compound I did not induce dystonia when tested in pigs sensitized to haloperidol, indiöating that Compound I does not possess EPS (extrapyramidal Symptoms) response/liability in humans.<br>
PCT/DK04/000546 describes the following medical uses of Compound I: a disease in the central nervous system, including psychosis, in particular schizophrenia (e.g. positive, negative, and/or depressive Symptoms) or other diseases involving psychotic Symptoms, such as, e.g., Schizophrenia, Schizophreniform Disorder, Schizoaffective Disorder, Delusional Disorder, Brief Psychotic Disorder, Shared Psychotic Disorder as well other psychotic disorders or diseases that present with psychotic Symptoms, e.g. mania in bipolar disorder. Also described is the use of Compound I for treatment of anxiety disorders, affective disorders including depression, sleep disturbances, migraine, neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism, or cocaine abuse, nicotine abuse, alcohol abuse and other abuse disorders.<br>
As indicated in PCT/DK04/000546 a group of Compounds structurally related to Compound I, i.e. trans isomers of 3-aryl-l-(l-piperazinyl)indanes substituted in the 2- and/or 3-position of the piperazine ring, has been described in EP 638 073; B0ges0 et al. in J. Med. Chem., 1995, 38, 4380-4392 and Klaus P. B0ges0 in "Drug Hunting, the Medicinal Chemistry of 1-Piperazino-3-phenylindans and Related Compounds", 1998, ISBN 87-88085-10-41 For example, an enantiomeric pure Compound corresponding to formula (I) but differing in that it has an N-methyl group instead of an W-hydrogen on the piperazine has been disclosed in B0ges0 et al. in J. Med. Chem., 1995, 38, 4380-4392, see table 5, Compound (-)-38.<br>
None of the above references apart from PCT/DK04/000546 disclose the specific enantiomeric form above (Compound I) or medical use thereof. The trans isomer in the form of the racemate of Compound I is only indirectly disclosed as an intermediate in the<br><br>
synthesis of Compound 38 in B0ges0 et al. in J. Med. Chem., 1995, 38, 4380-4392 while medical use of Compound I or its corresponding racemate is not described. Compound I as an intermediate is disclosed in PCT/DK04/000545 (WO05/016900).<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention in one aspect relates to a new process for the preparation of Compound I wherein the chirality is introduced earlier in the manufacturing process as compared to the process described in PCT/DK04/000546. The introduction of the chirality one step earlier is an advantage because the following step becomes more efficient in terms ofe.g. volume yield, and consumption of reagents and solvents and production of less waste. In PCT/DK04/000546, the chirality is introduced by resolving the racemic intermediate V below, either enzymatically or by chiral HPLC. The present inventors have now developed a route of synthesis in which the enantiomer of formula (I) is obtained via a sequence starting from enantiomeric pure IV, i.e. Compound IVa ((S)-6-chloro-3-phenylindan-l-one, see below). Thus, in this process, the intermediate of formula IV is resolved, e.g. by chiral ohromatography, to obtain the enantiomer of formula IVa.<br>
Furthermore, the present inventors have developed a method for the racemisation of the undesired enantiomer (Compound IVb, see below), which then can be reused in the resolution. This has a tremendous impact on the efficiency of the whole synthesis, as the efficiency of the steps before the resolution is increased as well as the subsequent steps.<br>
Accordingly, the enantiomer of formula (I) may be obtained by a process involving the<br>
following steps:<br><br>
Benzyl Cyanide is reacted with 2,5-dichIorobenzonitril in the presence of a base, suitably potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) in a suitable solvent such as 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME),<br><br>
further reaction with methyl chloro acetate (MCA) leads to spontaneous ring closure and one pot formation of the Compound of formula (II),<br>
The Compound of fonnula (II) is then subjected to acidic hydrolysis to form a Compound of formula (III), suitably by heating in a mixture of acetic acid, sulphuric acid and water, and thereafter decarboxylation, e.g., by heating the Compound of formula (III) in a suitable solvent, such as toluene with triethyl amine or N-methyl pyrrolidin-2-one (NMP), to form a Compound of formula (IV).<br><br>
The Compound of formula (IV) is resolved to achieve the desired enantiomer (formula IVa) for the further synthesis of Compound I, and the undesired enantiomer (formula IVb) which may be subjected to racemisation and recycling:<br><br>
The resolution of IV may, e.g, be performed using chiral chromatography, preferable liquid chromatography, or sub- or supercritical fluid chromatography.<br>
Chiral liquid chromatography may, e.g., be performed on a chiral stationary phase, suitably on a column of silica gel with an immobilized chiral polymer, or preferably on a column of silica gel coated with a chiral polymer, e.g. a modified cellulose, or a modified amylose,<br><br>
such as amylose tris [(S)-a-methylbenzylcarbamate], preferably a colutan of silica gel coated with amylose tris [(S)-a-methylbenzylcarbamate],<br>
A suitable solvent is used for the chiral liquid chromatography, such as, e.g. an alcohol (preferably a CM-alcohoI), a nitrile, an ether, or an alkane (preferably a C5_i0-alkane), or mixtures thereof, suitably ethanol, methanol, iso-propanol, acetonitrile, methyl tert-butyl ether or n-heptane or mixtures thereof, preferably ethanol or n-heptane or a mixture thereof. Acidic or basic modifiers can be added to the eluent, e.g. formic acid, acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, triethylamine, orA^W-diethy lamme.<br>
Sub- or supercritical fluid chromatography may, e.g., be performed on a chiral stationary phase, suitably on a column of silica gel with an immobilized chiral polymer, or on a column of silica gel coated with a chiral polymer, e.g. a modified amylose, such as amylose tris [(S)-a-methylben2ylcarbamate]? or preferably amylose tris (3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate), most preferably amylose tris (3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate) coated on silica gel, or a modified cellulose, such as cellulose tris (4-methylbenzoate), or preferable cellulose tris (3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate), most preferably cellulose tris (3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate) coated on silica gel. Other types of chiral stationary phases may be used, e.g. the Pirkle type columns, suitable on a column of silica gel with covalently bonded 3,5-dinitrobenzoyl tetrahydrophenanthrene amine,<br>
Sub- or supercritical carbon dioxide, suitable supercritical carbon dioxide, containing a modifier may be used as eluent for the sub- or supercritical fluid chromatography. The modifier is selected from the lower alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol and isopropanol, or e.g. acetonitril may be used. An amine, such as diethylamine, optionally 0.1% diethylamine, triethylamine, propylamine, and dimethyl iso-propyl amine, and optionally an acid, such as formic acid, acetic acid and trifluoroacetic acid may be added.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention the modifier is selected from the lower alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol and isopropanol, or e.g. acetonitril may be used, as long as the modifier is compatible with the column.<br><br>
The chiral chromatography can be scaled up using suitable technologies, e.g. simulated moving bed technology (SMB), or sub- or supercritical fluid technology (cf G. B. Cox (ed.) Preparative Enantioselective Chromatography, Blackwell Publishing Ltd., Oxford, UK, 2005).<br>
The Compound of formula (IVa) is then reduced e.g. with a complex metal hydride, such as borohydride, suitably with sodium borohydride (NaBüi) or such as lithium aluminiumhydride, in a solvent, such as an alcohol (e.g. a Ci-5-alcohol), e.g. ethanol or iso-propanol, and preferably at a temperature in the ränge of about-30° to +30°C, e.g. below 30 °C, below 20 °C, below 10 °C, or preferably below 5 °C5 to form a Compound of formula (Va) with eis configuration:<br><br>
The alcohol group of the cw-alcohol of formula (Va) is converted to a suitable leaving group, such as, e.g., a halogen, e.g, Cl or Br, preferably Cl„ or a sulphonate, e.g. mesylate (methansulfonylate) or tosylate (4-toluenesulfonylate), suitably by reaction with an agent, such as thionyl Chloride, mesyl (methansulfonyl) chloride or tosyl (4-toluenesuIfonyl) Chloride, in an inert solvent, e.g. an ether, suitably tetrahydrofuran. The resulting Compound has formula (VI), where LG is the leaving group:<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment, LG is Cl, i.e. the cis-chloride of formula (Via):<br><br><br>
Compound VI, e.g. with LG as chloro, is then reacted with 2,2-dimethylpiperazine in a suitable solvent, e.g. a ketone such as, e.g., methyl isobutyl ketone or methyl ethyl ketone, preferably methyl isobutyl ketone in the presence of a base, such as e.g., potassium carbonate, to obtain Compound I.<br>
Alternatively, the piperazine part of the molecule may be introduced by reacting Compound VI with a Compound of formula (VII) below, where PG is a protecting group, such as, but not restricted to, e.g. phenylmethoxycarbonyl (often called Cbz or Z), tert-butyloxycarbonyl (often called BOC), ethoxycarbonyl, or benzyl, thereby obtaining the Compound of formula (VIII) below. Compound VIII is subsequently deprotected to afford Compound I.<br><br>
A further'embodiment of the invention relates to a method for the manufacturing of a<br>
Compound	[Compound	IX:	4-((/i?,3S)-6-chloro-3-phenylindan-l-yl&gt; 1,2,2-<br>
irimethylpiperazine] having tlie following formula (IX) or a salt thereof:<br><br><br>
which method cornprises:<br>
(i) manufacturing Compound I by a method of the present invention, i.e. in particular firom Compound IVa; and<br>
(ii) Converting Compound I into Compound IX, preferably by methylating the secondary amine functionality, suitably by reductive alkylation using suitable agents, such as, e.g,, formaldehyde, paraformaldehyde, trioxane, or diethoxy methane (DEM).<br>
The term reductive alkylation refers to the above-mentioned reagents in combination with a reductive agent, such as formic acid.<br>
Thus, further embodiment of the invention relates to the methods as described herein for the manufacturing of Compound I, wherein Compound I is "replaced" by Compound IX.<br>
Compound IX is described generically in EP 638 073 white the enantiomer of formula (IX) has been described by Boges0 et al. in J. Med. Chem., 1995, 38, page 4380-4392, in the form of the fumarate salt, see table 5, Compound (-)-38. Compound IX and a method for manufacturing Compound IX from Compound I, and salts of Compound IX (in particular a crystalline succinate salt and a crystalline malonate salt) are further described in PCT/DK2004/00545.<br>
As indicated above the invention also relates to a method for the manufacturing of Compound I or Compound IX as described herein wherein Compound IVb is recycled such that it can be used for the synthesis of Compound I or Compound IX, respectively, see also<br>
the illustration below.<br><br><br>
Surprisingly, the racemisation of Compound IVb can be achieved using different types of bases, e.g. an amide, preferably a dialkylamide, e.g, but not limited to lithium diethylamide, lithium diisopropylamide, lithium tetramethylpiperidide, suitable lithium diisopropylamide (LDA), or a metal bis-silylamide, e.g. alkali bis(trimethylsilyl)amide, or an metal alkoxide, e.g. but not limited to metal methoxide, metal ethoxide, metal terf-butoxide, suitably alkali alkoxide, preferably potassium alkoxide, must preferably potassium terf-butoxide, or an alkyl metal, suitable an alkyl lithium, preferably butyl lithium or tert-butyl lithium. After quenching the reaction mixture, the racemic ketone IV can be isolated.<br>
The racemisation can be achieved using two different bases as well; again, different types of non nucleophillic bases can by used as "the former base" (base 1), e.g, an amide, preferably a dialkylamide, e.g, but not limited to lithium diethylamide, lithium diisopropylamide,<br><br>
lithium tetramethylpiperidide, suitable lithium diisopropylamide (LDA), or a metal bis-silylamide, e.g. lithium bis-silylamide, suitably lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide, or an metal alkoxide, e.g. but not limited to metal methoxide, metal ethoxide, metal ter/-butoxide, suitably alkali alkoxide, preferably lithium alkoxide, must preferably lithium te/Y-butoxide. After the former base (base 1) have beeil mixed with the ketone, "the latter base" (base 2) is added. As with the former base, different types of bases can be used; e.g. an amide, preferably a dialkylamide, e.g. but not limited to lithium diethylamide, lithium diisopropylamide, lithium tetramethylpiperidide, suitable lithium diisopropylamide (LDA), or a metal bis-silylamide, e.g. alkali bis(trimethylsilyl)amide, or an metal alkoxide, e.g. but not limited to metal methoxide, metal ethoxide, metal fc/t-butoxide, suitably alkali alkoxide, preferably potassium alkoxide, must preferably potassium te/Y-butoxide, or an alkyl metal, suitable an alkyl lithium, preferably butyl lithium orte/t-butyl lithium.<br>
Furthermore, racemisation can be obtained using two or more different bases by adding them all from the veiy start, preferable by adding two different bases firom the vexy Start.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention the racemisation can achieved by using a nucleophillic base.<br>
Alternatively, the racemic alcohol V can be resolved by chiral chromatography as described in PCT/DK04/000546, to obtain Va for the synthesis of Compound I, and Vb, which can be racemerised and reused in the resolution as indicated in the figure below. The racemisation of Vb is obtained by Oxidation of Vb to IVb, e.g. by using pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC), racemisation of IVb to IV as described above, and then reduction of IV to V in the usual way? as described above.<br><br><br>
When studying the raceraisation ona 10 g scale5 an impurity as a by product can be detected by LC-MS (liquid chromatography - mass spectroscopy); analytic data suggest that the impurity is a dimer of IV and/or the enantiomers IVa and IVb. The analytical data furthermore indicates, that the dimer can eliminate water, depending on the work up procedure. Laborious work has shown, that the formation of the dimer can be suppressed appreciably by carefully selecting the conditions for the racemisation, and the content of the dimer in the product can by further reduced by recrystallising the product from a suitably solvent, e.g. an alcohol, preferably ethanol or 2-propanol.<br><br>
During the synthesis of Compound I some eis diastereoisomer of Compound I (i.e. 1-((7iS;5*S)-6-chloro-3-phenylindan-l-yO-S^-dimethylpiperazine) may be formed as an impurity in the final produet. This impurity is due mainly to the formation of some of the trans form of (VI) (e.g. (15?3i?)-3)5-dichloro-l-phenylindan when LG is CI) in the step where Compound VI is formed. Therefore, the impurity can be minimized by ciystallisation of the desired eis form of Compound VI, from the mixture of trans and eis (VI); in the case where LG is Cl in Compound VI this can be done by stirring the mixture with a suitable solvent, e.g. an alkane (Cs-io-alkane), such as heptane, whereby the desired eis form of VI preeipitates and the undesired trans form of Compound VI goes into Solution. The desired eis form of Compound VI (e.g. when LG is Cl) is isolated, e.g., by filtration, and preferably washed with the solvent in question and dried.<br>
The eis form of Compound I may also be removed by preeipitation of a suitable salt of Compound I, e.g. a hydrochloride salt or a salt of an organic aeid, such as an organic diaeid, suitably a fumarate salt or a maleate salt of the Compound of formula (I), optionally followed by one or more re-crystallisations e.g. as described inPCT/DK2004/000546.<br>
The eis form of Compound I may also be removed by isolating Compound 1 as the free base from a suitable solvent.<br>
The invention in further aspects also relates to the intermediates as described herein for the synthesis of the Compound I, in particular the intermediates IVa and IVb. In this context is understood when specifying the stereoisomeric form, that the stereoisomer is the main constituent. In particular, when specifying the enantiomeric form, then the Compound has an enantiomeric excess of the enantiomer in question.<br>
Accordingly, one embodiment of the invention relates to the Compound of formula (IVa), preferably having an enantiomeric excess of at least 60% (60% enantiomeric excess means that the ratio of Compound IVa to its enantiomer is 80:20 in the mixture in question), at<br><br>
least 70%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 96%, preferabiy at least 98%. One embodiment relates to substantially pure Compound IVa.<br>
A further embodiment of the invention relates to the Compound of formula (IVb), preferabiy having an enantiomeric excess of at least 60%.<br>
The invention in a further aspect relates to Compound I or a salt thereof (e.g. a HCl, a fumarate or a maleate salt thereof) obtained by a metfaod of the invention, and the medical use thereof, in particular for the medical indication as disclosed herein, e.g. as an antipsycotic, such as for schizophrenia. Also within the invention are a pharmaceutical composition of Compound I or salt thereof obtained by a method of the invention.<br>
In the present context, in particular for the pharmaceutical uses of Compound I, it is understood that when specifying the enantiomer form as done in formula (I), then the Compound is preferabiy relatively stereochemically pure, preferabiy the enantiomeric excess is at least 60%, at least 70%, and more preferabiy at least 80% (80% enantiomeric excess means that the ratio of I to its enantiomer is 90:10 in the mixture in question) at least 90%, at least 96%, or preferabiy at least 98%. In a preferred embodiment, the diastereomeric excess of Compound I is at least 90% (90% diastereomeric purity means the ratio of Compound I to ^^^-((iSJ^-ö-chloro-S-phenylindan-l-yO-SjS-dimethylpiperazine is 95:5), at least 95%, at least 97%, or at least 98%.<br>
Accordingly, the process of the invention may comprise a step whereby Compound I or a salt thereof is foimulated into a pharmaceutical composition. The Compound, salt or composition of Compound I may be administered in any suitable way e.g. orally, buccal, sublingual or parenterally, and the Compound or salt may be presented in any suitable form for such administvation, e.g. in the form of tablets, capsules, powders, syrups or Solutions or dispersions for injection. In one embodiment, the Compound or salt of the invention are administered in the form of a solid pharmaceutical entity, suitably as a tablet or a capsule.<br>
Methods for the preparation of solid pharmaceutical preparations are well known in the art, Tablets may thus be prepared by mixing the active ingredient with ordinary adjuvants, fillers<br><br>
and diluents and subsequently compressing the mixture in a convenient tabletting machine. Examples of adjuvants, fillers and diluents comprise com starch, lactose, talcum, magnesium stearate, gelatine, lactose, gums, and the like. Any other adjuvant or additive such as colourings, aroma, preservatives, etc, may also be used provided that they are compatible with the active ingredients.<br>
Solutions for injections may be prepared by dissolving a salt of the invention and possible additives in a part of the solvent for injection, preferably sterile water, adjusting the Solution to desired volume, Sterilisation of the Solution and Alling in suitable ampules or vials. Any suitable additive conventionally used in the art may be added, such as tonicity agents, preservatives, antioxidants, solubilising agents etc.<br>
The daily dose of the Compound of formula (I) above, calculated as the free base, is suitably between 1.0 and 160 mg/day5 more suitable between 1 and 100 mg, e.g. preferably between 2 and 55 mg.<br>
The term "treatment" as used herein in connection with a disease or disorders includes also prevention as the case may be.<br>
The invention will be illustrated in the following non-limiting examples.<br>

After stirring for another 10 minutes, a Solution of (i?)-6-chloro-3-phenylindan-l~one (IVb) (synthesised as in example 12) (0.50 g) in THF (4. ml) is added drop wise over 5 minutes to the Solution of LDA ("the former base", base 1), and stirring at the water-ice batch is continued for V% an hour. Then BuLi (1.6 M in hexanes) (1.61 ml) ("the latter base", base 2) is added drop wise over 5 minutes, where after stirring at the ice-water batch is continued for 2x/i hours, and then hydrochloric acid (4 M, 4 ml) is added. After stirring for 10 minutes, the phases are separated, and the water phase is extracted with ethyl acetate (two times 10 ml). The combined organic phases are washed with sodium chloride (25 %&gt; 10 ml), dried with magnesium sulphate, filtered, and evaporated to dryness using a rotary evaporator.

A representative procedure is as follows:<br>
Diisopropylamine (6.25 g) is dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (THF) (160 ml), and the mixture is cooled with an dry ice/acetone batch while stirring under nitrogen. Butyl lithium (1.6 M in hexanes, 33 ml) is added slowly keeping the temperature below-60°C. Stirring is continued for 5 minutes at the dry ice/acetone batch, which is then replaced by an ice/water batch. The mixture is stirred for 10 minutes at -10 to 0°C, where after a Solution of (i?)-6«chloro-3-phenylindan-1-one (IVb) (synthesised as in example 12) (10.0 g) in THF (80 ml) is added slowly keeping the temperature below 5°C. After stirring for approximately 54 an hour, butyl lithium (1.6 M in hexanes, 33 ml) is added slowly, keeping the temperature below 5°C. ^fter stirring at 0-5°C for 2lA hours, hydrochloric acid (4 M, 100 ml) is added slowly. The<br><br>
phases are separated, and the water phase is extracted two times with ethyl acetate (100 ml). The combined organic phases are washed with 25% sodium Chloride (100 ml), and stirred for 10 minutes with magnesium sulphate (26 g), charcoal (1 g), and silica gel (2.6 g). After filtration, the organic phase is evaporated to diyness using a rotary evaporator. The residue is recrystallised from 2-propanoI (40 ml). The product is isolated by filtration, washed with ice cold 2-propanol (20 ml), and dried in the vacuum oven at 50°C over night. Yield 5.85 g (60 %). Melting point 95.2°C, NMR conforms to structure, [aJD20 -1.1° (c=l .0, methanol). CHN calculated for Ci5HnOCl: C 74.23, H 4.57; found: C 74.29, H 4.62. -1.0 % ee according to the chiral analysis.
