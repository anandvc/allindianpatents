				<td>[DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION]<br>
[0001]<br>
[Technical Field to which the Invention Belongs]<br>
The present invention relates to a body cover of a motor scooter type vehicle covering the external circumference of the vehicle and more particularly to a body cover of a motor scooter type vehicle allowing the air to flow into the body cover,<br>
[0002]<br>
[Prior Art]<br>
A motorcycle includes, for example, a scooter type vehicle of small displacement volume and this scooter type motorcycle is provided with a body cover which is extended to the lower side of the sheet to cover the external circumference.  For example, the body cover proposed in the official gazette of Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Hei 6-48343 (1994) "Scooter Type Vehicle" is provided with a ventilation port at the side portion thereof for cooling a muffler and electrical equipment with the air flowing to the inside of the body cover through the ventilation port.<br>
[0003]<br>
[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
However, the body cover proposed in above prior art cannot particularly regulate the running air flow coming into the body cover, allowing it to flow as it is and thereby cannot use efficiently such running air flow.<br>
Moreover, since this body cover is integrally extended to the lower side of the sheet, the body cover as a whole must be removed to perform the maintenance work for carburetor and air cleaner or the like.<br>
[0004]<br>
It is therefore a first object of the present invention to provide a ventilation structure of a body cover for motor scooter type vehicle which can effectively utilize the air by regulating the air flowing into the inside of body cover.<br>
It is a second object of the present invention to provide a technique to form a structure of the body cover of the motor scooter type vehicle which can perform the maintenance for carburetor and air cleaner or the like without removing the entire part of body cover.<br>
[0005]<br>
 [Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
The claim 1 for solving above problem is characterized in that a smoothing plate for causing the running air of ,the vehicle to flow along the internal surface of body cover is provided in the downstream side of the air inlet port provided to the body cover and an air cleaner is provided in the downstream side of the smoothing plate in such a condition that the air induction port is opened toward the internal surface of the body cover.<br>
[0006]<br>
As explained above, the smoothing plate is provided in the downstream side of the air inlet port provided to the'body cover and this smoothing plate causes the running air of the vehicle to flow along the internal surface of the body cover.  Therefore, flow of air is not disturbed by tires or the like and can be utilized effectively.<br>
Moreover, since the air induction port of the air cleaner is opened toward the internal surface of the body cover in the downstream side of the smoothing plate, entry of dusts raised by the tires or the like into the air cleaner can be prevented reliably and the<br>
fresh air not heated by the engine can be supplied into the air cleaner.<br>
The claim 2 of the present invention is characterized, for solving the problem explained above, that the body cover of the motor scooter type vehicle extending to the lower side under the sheet is formed as the removable subcover at the part overlapping with carburetor and air cleaner in the side elevation.<br>
Thereby, the part overlapping with the<br>
carburetor and air cleaner in the side elevation can be opened only by removing the subcover from the body.<br>
The claim 3 is characterized in that the body cover is provided with an exhaust port for exhausting the air in the body cover at the side position of the air cleaner.<br>
As explained above, since the exhaust port is provided on the subcover, the subcover is formed in light weight and can easily be removed.  In addition, since the exhaust port is formed, contamination of external surface of the air cleaner can be confirmed at a glance from the outside of the body cover through the exhaust port and moreover the timing for maintenance of carburetor and air cleaner, etc. can be judged easily.<br>

(... indicates plural numbers) formed at the inside of the rear upper cover 51 via the small screws 53,...  Thereby, the smoothing plate 52 can be provided in almost parallel to the rear upper cover 51 keeping the constant interval from the rear upper cover 51.  The smoothing plate 52 is preferably formed of a plated copper plate because the plating after the processing can be eliminated to realize low cost manufacture.<br>
[0018]<br>
Operations of ventilation structure of the body cover of a motor scooter type vehicle in relation to the present invention will be explained hereunder.<br>
First, the smoothing plate 52 shown in Fig. 5 is attached to the projections 51c,... with small screws 53,....  Thereafter, the rear upper cover 51 is attached to the predetermined position of the vehicle.<br>
[0019]<br>
After the entire part of body cover is attached to the predetermined position, the side cover 46 is then attached in accordance with Fig. 6 to Fig. 9.<br>
Fig. 6 is the diagram viewed in the direction of arrow mark 6 in Fig. 3.  Engaging pawls 46c, 46c formed at the frond end part of the subcover 46 are engaged with the front cover 44 shown in Fig. 3 to hold the subcover 46 in the same plane as the front cover 44. Under this condition, the screw 47 is screwed into a recessed area 46d from the outside of the subcover 46. In this case, the subcover 46 is attached in the same plane as the rear upper cover 51 under the condition that a bending part formed at the upper part of the subcover 46 is placed in contact with the bending part formed at the lower end part of the rear upper cover 51.<br>
[0020]<br>
Fig. 7 is a sectional view along the line 7-7 of Fig. 3.  A small screw 47 is screwed into a recessed part 46 of the side cover 46 for threading with a nut 48.  Thereby, the subcover 46 is engaged with the front cover 44 with a small screw 47.  In this case, the subcover 46 is attached to the rear upper cover 51 in the same plane. -[0021]<br>
Fig. 8 is a sectional view along the line 8-9 in Fig. 3.  An engaging pawl 46e formed at the upper part of the side cover 46 is screwed into an aperture 51d formed at the lower end part of the rear upper cover 51.  In this case, the subcover 46 is attached in the same plane as the rear upper cover 51 under the condition that the bending part formed at the upper part of the subcover 46 is placed in contact with the bending part formed at the lower end part of the rear upper cover 51.<br>
[0022]<br>
Fig. 9 is a sectional view along the line 9-9 in Fig. 3.  A small screw 47 is screwed into a recessed part 46f formed at the rear end part of the subcover 46 and is then coupled by screwing with the rear cover 45 shown in Fig. 3 to engage the rear end part of the side cover 46 with the rear cover 45.  In this case, the subcover 46 is provided in the same plane as the rear upper cover 51 under the condition that the bending part formed at the upper part of the subcover 46 is placed in contact with the bending part formed at the lower end part of the rear upper cover 51.  In addition, the side cover 46 is attached in the same plane as the rear cover 45 under the condition that the bending part 46g formed<br>
at the rear end part of the side cover 46 is placed in contact with the rear cover 45 shown in Fig. 3.<br>
[0023]<br>
As explained previously, the subcover 46 can be fixed to the body cover by fixing the front end part of the subcover 46 to the front cover with the screwing and then fixing, also by screwing, the rear end part of the subcover 46 to the rear cover 45.  In this case, the subcover 46 is provided in the same plane as the front cover 44 by placing in contact the front end part of the subcover 46 with the front cover 44 shown in Fig. 3 without permitting any clearance.  In addition, the subcover 46 is provided in the same plane as the rear upper cover 51 in such a manner that the bending part formed at the upper part of the subcover 46 is placed in contact, without permitting any clearance, with the bending part formed at the lower end part of the rear upper cover 51.  Moreover, the side cover 46 is attached in the same plane as the side cover 46 in such a manner that the bending part formed at the rear end part of the side cover 46 is placed in contact, without permitting any clearance, with the rear cover 45 shown in Fig. 3.<br>
[0024]<br><br>
Thereby, the side cover 46 can easily be attached in the same plane as the body cover without permitting any clearance with respect to the body cover only by tightening the small screws 47, 47 to the front end part and rear end part of the side cover 46.<br>
[0025]<br>
Next, removal of side cover 46 will be<br>
explained.  First, the small screw 47 fixing the front end part of the side cover 46 is removed and then the small screw 47 fixing the rear end part of the side cover 46 is removed.  Thereafter, the side cover 46 is moved to the lower side to pull the engaging pawl 46e formed at the upper part of the side cover 46 from the aperture 51d formed at the lower end part of the rear upper cover 51 and remove the engaging pawls 46c, 46c formed at the front end part of the subcover 46 from the front cover 44 shown in Fig. 3.  Thereby, the side cover 46 can be removed from the body cover.<br>
As explained above, the side cover 46 can easily be removed from the body cover only by removing the small screws 47, 47 tightening the front end part and rear end part of the side cover 46.<br>
[0026]<br>
Next, flow of air taken up from the inlet 51a of the rear upper cover 51 will then be explained.<br>
Fig. 10 is a diagram for explaining flow of air in the ventilation structure of the body cover of motor scooter type vehicle in relation to the present invention.  First, the air is taken into the body cover from the inlet 51a as indicated by the white arrow marks.  The air taken into the body cover is guided to flow along the internal surface of the rear upper cover 51 by the smoothing plate 52 provided at the downstream side of the inlet 51a.  In this case, since the air induction port 18a of the air cleaner 18 is arranged toward the internal surface of the rear upper cover 51, the air flowing to the downstream side along the internal surface of the rear upper cover 51 is effectively taken up into the air cleaner 18 from the air induction port 18a.<br>
On the other hand, the air not taken-up into the air induction port 18a is caused to flow to the downstream side along the internal surface of the rear upper cover 51 and is then exhausted to the outside from the outlet 51b.<br>
[0027]<br>
[Effect of the Invention]<br>
The present invention offers following effects with the structure explained previously.<br>
As described in claim 1, since the smoothing plate is provided in the downstream side of the air induction port provided to the body cover and this smoothing plate causes the air taken-up to flow along the internal surface of the body cover, air flow is never disturbed by the tires or the like and can be used effectively to cool muffler and electrical equipment.<br>
Moreover, since the air induction port of the air cleaner is opened at the downstream side of the smoothing plate toward the internal surface of the body cover, it can effectively be prevented that dusts raised by tires, etc. enter the air cleaner, and the fresh air not influenced by the heat of engine can be supplied to the air cleaner.  Therefore, excellent output characteristic of the engine can be assured.<br>
As described in claim 2, since the body cover is formed as the removable subcover at the area overlapping with the carburetor and air cleaner in the side elevation, the part overlapping with the carburetor and air cleaner in the side elevation can be opened only by removing the subcover from the body cover and the<br>
maintenance work for these elements can be performed very easily.<br>
[0028]<br>
As described in claim 3, the subcover can be<br>
formed in light weight and can easily be removed by providing the exhaust port to the subcover.  Moreover, in case the exhaust port is provided, contamination at the external surface of the air cleaner can be verified at a glance from the outside of the body cover via the exhaust port.  In addition, the timing for the maintenance of carburetor and air cleaner, etc. can be judged easily.<br>
