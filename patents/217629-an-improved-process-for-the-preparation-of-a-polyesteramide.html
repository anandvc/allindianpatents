				<td>AN IMPROVED PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF A POLYESTERAMIDE Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of a polyesteramide. More specifically the present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of a polyesteramide by contacting carbon monoxide, an aromatic dihalide and a suitable aminohydroxy compound in presence of a catalyst and a base. Background of the invention<br>
Polyesteramides are characterized by presence of amide as well as ester functionality in the polymer backbone and therefore are hybrid structures of polyamides and polyesters. These polymers have attracted strong industrial interest because of their excellent heat resistant properties. Various methods have been described in the prior art for the preparation of polyesteramides. These methods generally involve polycondesation reactions of di-acid or a suitable derivative thereof with an aminohydroxy compound.<br>
US Patent 4855397 discloses the preparation of polyesteramide with lower gas permeability by reacting an amino alcohol and a dicarboxylic acid at elevated temperature. US Patent 4237251 discloses a two step process for the preparation of polyesteramides in which the first step is condensation of an aromatic monoalkyl dicarboxylates with an aromatic diisocynate to produce aromatic dialkyl diamidedicarboxylate, which in the second step is condensed with a polyhydroxy compound. US Patent 5185424 provides a method for polyesteramide preparation by condensation of aminophenol and hydroquinone derivative with aromatic dicarboxylic acids. US Patent 4839441 discloses the condensation of dicarboxylate-capped polyamide with a diol to prepare polyesteramide.<br>
Conventional processes for the preparation of polyesteramides suffer from many drawbacks. Firstly, these require the presence of carboxylic group or a suitable derivative thereof in at least one of the monomers and therefore such process is limited to small number of available carboxylic acids. Secondly, conventional processes require use of carboxylic acids or derivatives thereof like acid chloride etc. which are often sensitive to moisture and difficult to handle. Furthermore, the activity of such dicarboxylic acids or their derivatives towards polycondensation has to be high enough to produce sufficiently high molecular weight polymer for any suitable application.<br>
Because of the commercial interest in polyesteramides, increasing academic as well as industrial attention has been paid towards research in developing new methods for their preparation. In view of the advantages and features of the present invention, the process of<br><br>
this invention would be a significant advance in the current state of the art related to the synthesis of polyesteramides. Objects of the invention<br>
