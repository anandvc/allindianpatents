6-(2,6-Difluoro-phenyl)-triazolopyrimidines<br>
Descript10n<br>
The invent10n relates to 6-(2,6-difluoro-phenyl)-triazolopyrimidines of formula I<br>
I<br>
in which <br>
R1 and R2 independently denote hydrogen or<br>
C1-C10-alkyl, C2-C10-alkenyl, C2-C10-alkynyl, or C4-C10-alka-<br>
dienyl, C3-C10-cycloalkyl, phenyl, naphthyl, or<br>

atoms or one to three nitrogen atoms and one sulfur or oxygen<br>
atom, or<br>
where R1 and R2 radicals may be unsubstituted or may carry one to three groups Ra,<br>

ll  and R2 together with the interjacent nitrogen atom represent a 5- or 6-membered heterocyclic ring, containing one to four nitrogen atoms or one to three nitrogen atoms and one sulfur or oxygen atom, which may be substituted by one to three Ra<br>
radicals;<br>
I        is halogen, cyano, C1-C6~alkoxy, C1-C6-haloalkoxy or C3-Cs-al-kenyloxy.<br>
loreover, the invent10n relates to processes for their prepara-:10n, composit10ns containing them and to their use for combating )hytopathogenic fungi.<br><br>
5-Phenyl-7-amino-triazolopyrimidines are generally known from JS 4,567,262 and US 5,593,996.<br>
Triazolopyrimidines with a trifluorophenyl group in 6-posit10n ire disclosed in WO-A 98/46607 and EP-A 945 453.<br>
?rom WO-A 98/46608 some 6-(2,6-difluoro-phenyl)-triazolopyrimidi-ies are known, which are substituted in the 7-posit10n by fluori-lated alkylamines.<br>
?he compounds disclosed in the documents discussed above are said :o be active against var10us phytopathogenic fungi.<br>
:t is an object of the present invent10n to provide compounds having improved fungiC1dal activity.<br>
le  have found that this object is achieved by the compounds defi-Led at the outset. Furthermore, we have found processes for their reparat10n, composit10ns comprising them and methods for :ontrolling phytopathogenic fungi using the compounds I.<br>
'he compounds of the formula I differ from the compounds known rom WO-A 98/46608 in the combinat10n of the 2,6-difluoro-phenyl roup with an halogen free amino group in the 7-posit10n of the riazolopyrimidine system.<br>
he present invent10n further provides a process for the prepara-10n of compounds of formula I as defined above which comprises reating a 5,7-dihalo compound of formula II in which X is halo-en with an amine of formula III.<br><br>
he react10n between the 5,7-dihalo compound II and the amine of ormula III can be carried out under condit10ns known from WO-A 8/46608.<br>
Dmpounds of formula II are known from EP-A 550 113; they can be repared by known methods [cf. EP-A 550 113 or EP-A 770 615].<br>
le react10n is preferably carried out in the presence of a Solent . Suitable solvents include ethers, such as d10xane, diethyl :her and, espeC1ally, tetrahydrofuran, halogenated hydrocarbons<br><br>
such as dichloromethane and aromatic hydrocarbons, for example toluene.<br>
The react10n is suitably carried out at a temperature in the range from 0°C to 70°C/ the preferred react10n temperature being from 10°C to 3 5°C.<br>
It is also preferred that the react10n is carried out in the presence of a base. Suitable bases include tertiary amines, such as triethylamine, and inorganic bases, such as potassium carbonate or sodium carbonate. Alternatively, an excess of the compound of formula III may serve as a base.<br>
The react10n mixtures are worked up in a customary manner, for example by mixing with water, phase separat10n and, if required, chromatographic purificat10n of the crude products. Some of the end products are obtained in the form of colorless or slightly brownish, viscous oils, which are purified or freed from volatile components under reduced pressure and at moderately elevated temperatures. If the end products are obtained as solids, purificat10n can also be carried out by recrystallizat10n or digest10n.<br>
Compounds of formula II are known in the art and can be obtained by synthesis routes disclosed in EP-A 550 113, EP-A 770 615 and WO-A 98/46608.<br>
Compounds of formula I in which X denotes cyano, C1-C6~alkoxy, C1-C6-haloalkoxy or C3-Cs-alkenyloxy can be prepared by reacting compounds I in which X is halogen, preferably chloro, with compounds of formula IV, which are, dependent from the value of X' to be introduced to yield formula I compounds, an anorganic cyano salt, an alkoxylate, haloalkoxylate or an alkenyloxylate, respectively, preferably in the presence of a a solvent. The cat10n M in formula IV has minor influence; for practical and economical reasons usually ammonium-, tetraalkylammonium- or alkalimetal-and earth metal salts are preferred.<br><br>
The react10n is suitably carried out at a temperature in the range from 0 to 120°C, the preferred react10n temperature being from 10 to 40°C [cf. J. Heterocycl. Chem. , Vol. 12, p. 861-863 (1975) ] .<br><br>
suitable solvents include ethers, such as d10xane, diethyl ether and, espeC1ally, tetrahydrofuran, halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane and aromatic hydrocarbons, for example toluene.<br>
If individual compounds I are not obtainable by the routes described above, they can be prepared by derivatizat10n of other compounds I.<br>

Moreover, the compounds I are suitable for controlling harmful fungi such as PaeC1lomyces var10tii in the protect10n of materials (e.g. wood, paper, paint dispers10ns, fibers and tissues) and in the protect10n of stored products.<br>
The compounds I are applied by treating the fungi, or the plants, seeds, materials or the soil to be protected against fungal infect10n, with a fungiC1dally active amount of the active ingredients. Applicat10n can be effected both before and after infect10n of the materials, plants or seeds by the fungi.<br>
In general, the fungiC1dal composit10ns comprise from 0.1 to 95, preferably 0.5 to 90, % by weight of active ingredient.<br>
When used in crop protect10n, the rates of applicat10n are from 0.01 to 2.0 kg of active ingredient per ha, depending on the nature of the effect desired.<br><br>
Ln the treatment of seed, amounts of active ingredient of from 3.001 to 0.1 g, preferably 0.01 to 0.05 g, are generally required per kilogram of seed.<br>
tfhen used in the protect10n of materials or stored products, the rate of applicat10n of active ingredient depends on the nature of the field of applicat10n and on the effect desired. Rates of applicat10n convent10nally used in the protect10n of materials are, for example, from 0.001 g to 2 kg, preferably 0.005 g to 1 kg, of active ingredient per cubic meter of material treated.<br>
The compounds I can be converted into the customary formulat10ns, e.g. solut10ns, emuls10ns, suspens10ns, dusts, powders, pastes and granules. The use form depends on the particular purpose; in any case, it should guarantee a fine and uniform distribut10n of the compound according to the invent10n.<br>
The formulat10ns are prepared in a known manner, e.g. by extending the active ingredient with solvents and/or carriers, if desired using emulsifiers and dispersants, it also being possible to use other organic solvents as auxiliary solvents if water is used as the diluent. Auxiliaries which are suitable are essentially: solvents such as aromatics (e.g. xylene), chlorinated aromatics (e.g. chlorobenzenes), paraffins (e.g. mineral oil fract10ns), alcohols (e.g. methanol, butanol), ketones (e.g. cy-clohexanone), amines (e.g. ethanolamine, dimethylformamide) and water; carriers such as ground natural minerals (e.g. kaolins, clays, talc, chalk) and ground synthetic minerals (e.g. highly-disperse silica, silicates); emulsifiers such as non-10nic and an10nic emulsifiers (e.g. polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, alkylsulfonates and arylsulfonates) and dispersants such as li-gnin-sulfite waste liquors and methylcellulose.<br>

Powders, materials for scattering and dusts can be prepared by mixing or concomitantly grinding the active substances with a solid carrier.<br>
Granules, e.g. coated granules, impregnated granules and homogeneous granules, can be prepared by binding the active ingredients to solid carriers. Examples of solid carriers are mineral earths, such as silicas, silica gels, silicates, talc, kaolin, attaclay, limestone, lime, chalk, bole, loess, clay, dolomite, diatomaceous earth, calC1um sulfate, magnesium sulfate, magnesium oxide, ground synthetic materials, fertilizers, e.g. ammonium sulfate, ammonium phosphate, ammonium nitrate, ureas, and products of vegetable origin, such as cereal meal, tree bark meal, wood meal and nutshell meal, cellulose powders and other solid carriers.<br>
In general, the formulat10ns comprise of from 0.01 to 95% by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 90% by weight, of the active ingredient . The active ingredients are employed in a purity of from 90% to 100%, preferably 95% to 100% (according to NMR spectrum).<br>
The following are exemplary formulat10ns:<br>
I.	5 parts by weight of a compound according to the invent10n are mixed intimately with 95 parts by weight of finely divided kaolin. This gives a dust which comprises 5% by weight of the active ingredient.<br>
II.	30 parts by weight of a compound according to the invent10n are mixed intimately with a mixture of 92 parts by weight of pulverulent silica gel and 8 parts by weight of paraffin oil which had been sprayed onto the surface of this silica gel.<br><br>
This gives a formulat10n of the active ingredient with good adhes10n properties (comprises 23% by weight of active ingredient) .<br>
10 parts by weight of a compound according to the invent10n are dissolved in a mixture composed of 90 parts by weight of xylene, 6 parts by weight of the adduct of 8 to 10 mol of ethylene oxide and 1 mol of oleic aC1d N-monoethanolamide, 2 parts by weight of calC1um dodecylbenzenesulfonate and 2 parts by weight of the adduct of 4 0 mol of ethylene oxide and 1 mol of castor oil (comprises 9% by weight of active ingredient).<br>

90 parts by weight of a compound according to the invent10n are mixed with 10 parts by weight of N-methyl-CC-pyrrolidone, which gives a solut10n which is suitable for use in the form of microdrops (comprises 90% by weight of active ingredient) .<br>
2 0 parts by weight of a compound according to the invent10n are dissolved in a mixture composed of 40 parts by weight of cyclohexanone, 3 0 parts by weight of isobutanol, 2 0 parts by weight of the adduct of 7 mol of ethylene oxide and 1 mol of isooctylphenol and 10 parts by weight of the adduct of 40 mol of ethylene oxide and 1 mol of castor oil. Pouring the solut10n into 100,000 parts by weight of water and finely distributing it therein gives an aqueous dispers10n which comprises 0.02% by weight of the active ingredient.<br>
. 2 0 parts by weight of a compound according to the invent10n are mixed thoroughly with 3 parts by weight of sodium diiso-<br><br>
butylnaphthalene-Ct-sulfonate, 17 parts by weight of the sodium salt of a lignosulfonic aC1d from a sulfite waste liquor and 60 parts by weight of pulverulent silica gel, and the mixture is ground in a hammer mill. Finely distributing the mixture in 20,000 parts by weight of water gives a spray mixture which comprises 0.1% by weight of the active ingredient.<br>
The active ingredients can be used as such, in the form of their formulat10ns or the use forms prepared therefrom, e.g. in the form of directly sprayable solut10ns, powders, suspens10ns or dispers10ns, emuls10ns, oil dispers10ns, pastes, dusts, materials for spreading, or granules, by means of spraying, atomizing, dusting, scattering or pouring. The use forms depend entirely on the intended purposes; in any case, this is intended to guarantee the finest possible distribut10n of the active ingredients according to the invent10n.<br>
Aqueous use forms can be prepared from emuls10n concentrates, pastes or wettable powders (sprayable powders, oil dispers10ns) by adding water. To prepare emuls10ns, pastes or oil dispers10ns, the substances as such or dissolved in an oil or solvent, can be homogenized in water by means of wetter, tackifier, dispersant or emulsifier. Alternatively, it is possible to prepare concentrates composed of active substance, wetter, tackifier, dispersant or emulsifier and, if appropriate, solvent or oil, and such concentrates are suitable for dilut10n with water.<br>
The active ingredient concentrat10ns in the ready-to-use products can be varied within substantial ranges. In general, they are from 0.0001 to 10%, preferably from 0.01 to 1%.<br>
The active ingredients may also be used successfully in the ultra-low-volume process (ULV), it being possible to apply formulat10ns comprising over 95% by weight of active ingredient, or even the active ingredient without additives.<br>
Var10us types of oils, herbiC1des, fungiC1des, other pestiC1des, or bacteriC1des may be added to the active ingredients, if appropriate also only immediately pr10r to use (tank mix). These agents can be admixed with the agents according to the invent10n in a weight rat10 of 1:10 to 10:1.<br>
In the use form as fungiC1des, the composit10ns according to the invent10n can also be present together with other active ingre-dients, e.g. with herbiC1des, insectiC1des, growth regulators, fungiC1des or else with fertilizers. Mixing the compounds I or<br><br>
