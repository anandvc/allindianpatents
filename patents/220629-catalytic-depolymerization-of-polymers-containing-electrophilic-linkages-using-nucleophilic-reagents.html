CATALYTIC DEFOLVMERIZATION OF FOLVMERS CONTAINING ELECTROPHILIC LINKAGES USING NUCLEOPHILIC REAGENTS<br>
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT of GOVERNMENT SUPPORT<br>
[0001]	This invention was made iiJpart with Government support under a grant from<br>
the National Science Foundation (CoOTcrative Agreement No. DMR-980677). Accordingly, the Government may have certain pTghts to this invention.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002]	This invention relates generally to the depolymerization of polymers, and,<br>
more particularly relates to an organocatalytic method for depolymerizing polymers using nucleophilic reagents.. The invention is applicable in numerous fields, including industrial chemistry and chemical waste disposal, plastics recycling, and manufacturing processes requiring a simple and convenient method for the degradation of polymers.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0003]	Technological advances of all kinds continue to present many complex<br>
ecological issues. Consequently, waste management and pollution prevention are two very significant challenges of the 21" century. The overwhelming quantity of plastic refuse has significantly contributed to the critical shortage of landfill space faced by many communities. For example, poly(ethylene terephthalate) (poly(oxy-l,2-ethanediyl-oxycarbonyl-l,4-diphenylenecarbonyl); "PET"), a widely used engineering thermoplastic for carpeting, clothing, tire cords, soda bottles and other containers, fihn, automotive applications, electronics, displays, etc. will contribute more than 1 billion pounds of waste to land-fills in 2002 alone. The worldwide production of PET has been growing at an annual rate of 10 % per year, and with the increase in use in electronic and automotive applications, this rate is expected to increase significantly to 15% per year.   Interestingly, the precursor monomers represent only about 2% of the petrochemical stream. Moreover, the proliferation of the use of organic solvents, halogenated solvents, water, and energy consumption in addressing the need to recycle commodity polymers such as PET and other polyesters has created the need for envu-onmentally responsible and energy efficient recyclmg processes. See Nadkami (1999) International Fiber Journal 14(3).<br><br>
[0004]	Significant effort has been invested in researching recycling strategies for PET,<br>
and these efforts have produced three commercial options; mechanical, chemical and energy recycling. Energy recycling simply bums the plastic for its calorific content. Mechanical recycling, the most widespread approach, involves grinding the polymer to powder, which is then mixed with "virgin" PET. See Mancini et al. (1999) Materials Research 2(l):33-38. Many chemical companies use this process in order to recycle PET at the rate of approximately 50,000 tons/year per plant.   In Europe, all new packaging materials as of 2002 must contain 15% recycled material. However, it has been demonstrated that successive recycling steps cause significant polymer degradation, in turn resulting in a loss of desirable mechanical properties. Recycling using chemical degradation involves a process that depolymerizes a polymer to starting material, or at least to relative short oligomeric components. Clearly, this process is most desirable, but is the most difficult to control since elevated temperature and pressure are required along with a catalyst composed of a strong base, or an organometallic complex such as an organic titanate. See Sako et al. (1997) Proc. ofthe4' Int'l Symposium on Supercritical Fluids, ^^. 107-110. The use of such a catalyst results in significant quantities of undesirable byproducts, and materials processed by these methods are thus generally unsuitable for use in medical materials or food packaging, limiting their utility. Moreover, the energy required to effect depolymerization essentially eliminates sustainability arguments.<br>
[OOOS]	Accordingly, there is a need in the art for an improved depolymerization	.<br>
method. Ideally, such a method would not involve extreme reaction conditions, use of metallic catalysts, or a process that results in significant quantities of potentially problematic by-products.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006]	The invention is directed to the aforementioned need in the art, and, as such,<br>
provides an efficient catalytic depolymerization reaction that employs mild conditions, wherein production of undesirable byproducts resultmg from polymer degradation is minimized.   The reaction can be carried out at temperatures of at most 80 °C, and, because a nonmetaJlic catalyst is preferably employed, the depolymerization products, in a preferred embodiment, are substantially free of metal contaminants.   With many of the caibene<br><br>
catalysts aisciosea nerein, ine uepuiynicnzaLiuii icia»,Lion can be carried out at a temperature<br>
of at most 60 °C or even 30 °C or lower, i.e., at room temperature.<br>
10007]	More specifically, in one aspect of the invention, a method is provided for<br>
depolymerizing a polymer having a backbone containing electrophilic linkages, wherein the method involves contacting the polymer with a nucleophilic reagent and a catalyst at a temperature of less than 80 °C. An important application of this method is in the depolymerization of polyesters, including homopolymeric polyesters (in which ali of the electrophilic linkages are ester linkages) and polyester copolymers (in which a fraction of the electrophilic linkages are ester linkages and the remainder of the electrophilic linkages are other than ester linkages).<br>
[0008]	In a related aspect of the invention, a method is provided for depolymerizing a<br>
polymer having a backbone containing electrophilic linkages, wherein the method involves contacting the polymer with a nucleophilic reagent and a catalyst that yields depolymerization products that are substantially free of metal contaminants. The polymer may be, for example, a polyester, a polycarbonate, a polyurethane, or a related polymer, in either homopolymeric or copolymeric form, as indicated above. In this embodiment, in order to provide reaction products that are substantially free of contamination by metals and metal-containing compounds, the catalyst used is a purely organic, normietallic catalyst. Preferred catalysis herein are carbene compounds, which act as nucleophilic catalysts, as well as precursors to carbene compounds, as will be discussed injra. As is well understood in the art, carbenes are electronically neutral compounds containing a divalent carbon atom with only six electrons in its valence shell.   Carbenes include, by way of example, cyclic diaminocarbenes, imida2ol-2-ylidenes (e.g., l,3-dimesityl-imidazol-2-ylidene and 1,3-dimesityl-4,5-dihydroiniidazoI-2-yIidene), J,2,4-lria2oI-3-y]idenes, and l,3-thiazo!-2-ylidenes; see Bourissou et al. (2000) Chem. Rev. 100:39-91.<br>
[0009]	Since the initial description of the synthesis, isolation, and characterization of<br>
stable carbenes by Arduengo (Arduengo et al. (1991) J Am. Chem, Soc. 113:361; Arduengo et al. (1992) J. Am. Chem, Soc. J_U:5530), the exploration of their chemical reactivity has become a major area of research. See, e.g., Arduengo et al. (I999)^cc. Chem. Res. 32:913; Bourissou etal. (2000), jupra; and Brode (1995) yiwgew. Chem. Int. Ed. Eng. 34:1021. Although carbenes have now been extensively investigated, and have in fact been established as usefiil in many synthetically important reactions, there has been no disclosure or<br><br>
suggestion to use carbenes as catalysts in nucleophilic depolymerization reactions, i.e., reactions in which a polymer containing electrophilic lijikages is depolymerized with a nucleophilic reagent m the presence of a carbene catalyst.<br>

[00059]	Accordingly, the invention features a method for depolymerizing a polymer<br>
having a backbone containing electrophilic linkages. The electrophilic linkages may be, for<br>
example, ester Imkages (-(CO)-O-), carbonate linkages {-O-(CO)-O)-, urethane linkages<br>
(-O-(CO)-NH), substituted urethane linkages {-0-(CO)-NR-, where R is a nonhydrogen<br>

cleaved using nucleophilic reagents will be known to those of ordinary skill in the art of<br>
organic chemistry and polymer science and/or can be readily found by reference to the<br>
pertinent texts and literature. The polymer undergoing depolymerization may be linear or<br>
branched, and may be a homopolymer or copolymer, the latter including random, block,<br>
multiblock, and alternating copolymers, terpolymers, and the like. Examples of polymers<br>
that can be depolymerized using the methodology of the invention include, without<br>
limitation:<br>

&amp;om monoethylene glycol and terephthalic acid), bottle-grade PET (a copolymer made based<br>
on monoethylene glycol, terephthalic acid, and other comonomers such as isophthalic acid,<br>
cyclohexene dimethanol, etc.), poly (butylene terephthalate) (PBT), and poly(hexamethylene<br>

[00062]	poly(alkylene suberates) such as poly(ethylene suberate);<br>
[00063]	poly(alkylene sebacales) such as poly(ethylene sebacate);<br>
[00064]	poly(e-caprolactone) and poly(P-propiolactone);<br>

[00077]	polyurethane/polyester copolymers such as that available under the tradename<br>
Baydar , from Bayer Corporation.<br>
[00078]	Depolymerization of the polymer is carried out, as indicated above, in the<br>
presence of a nucleophilic reagent and a catalyst. Nucleophilic reagents, as will be<br>
appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art, include monohydric alcohols, diols, polyols,<br>
thiols, primary amines, and the like, and may contain a single nucleophilic moiety or two or<br>
more nucleophilic moieties, e.g., hydroxyl, sulfhydryl, and/or amino groups. The<br>
nucleophilic reagent is selected to correspond to the particular electrophilic linkages in the<br>
polymer backbone, such that nucleophilic attack at the elecfrophilic linkage results in<br>
cleavage of the linkage, For example, a polyester can be cleaved at the ester linkages within<br>
the polymer backbone using an alcohol, preferably a primary alcohol, most preferably a C2-<br>
C4 monohydric alcohol such as ethanol, isopropanol, and t-butyl alcohol. It will be<br>
appreciated that such a reaction cleaves the ester linkages via a transesterification reaction, as<br>
will be illustrated infra.<br>
[00079]	The preferred catalysts for the depolymerization reaction are carbenes and	^^^<br>
carbene precursors. Carbenes include, for instance, diarylcarbenes, cyclic diaminocarbenes,<br><br>
imidazol-2-ylidenes, 1,2,4-triazol-3-yHdenes, l,3-thiazol-2-ylidenes, acyclic diaminQcarbenes, acyclic aminooxycarbenes, acyclic aminothiocarbenes, cyclic diborylcarbenes, acyclic diborylcarbenes, phosphinosilylcarbenes, phosphinophosphoniocarbenes, sulfenyl-trifluoromethylcarbene, and sulfenyl-pentafiuorothiocarbene. See Bourissou et al. (2000), cited supra. Preferred carbenes are heteroatom-stabilized carbenes and preferred carbene precursors are precmsors lo heteroatom-stabilized cartienes. nitrogen-containing carbenes, with N-heterocyclic carbenes most preferred.<br>
[00080]	In one embodiment, heteroatom-stabilized carbenes suitable as<br>
depolymerization catalysts herein have the structure of formula (I)<br><br>
wherein the various substituents are as follows:<br>
100081]	E' and E^ are independently selected from N, NR^, O, P, PR^, and S, R^ is<br>
hydrogen, heteroalkyl, or heteroaryl, and x and y are independently zero, 1, or 2, and are<br>
selected to correspond to the valence state of E' and E^, respectively. When E^ and E are<br>
other than O or S, then E' and E^ may be linked through a linking moiety that provides a<br>
heterocyclic ring in which E' and E are incorporated as heteroatoms. In the latter case, the<br>
heterocyclic ring may be aliphatic or aromatic, and may contain substituents and/or<br>
heteroatoms. Generally, such a cyclic group will contain 5 or 6 ring atoms.<br>
[00082]	For example, in representative compounds of formula (I):<br>
(1)	E' isOorSandxisl;<br>
(2)	E' is N, X is 1, and E^ is linked to E^;<br><br>
(3)	E' is N, x is 2, and E' and E^ are not linked;<br>
(4)	E' is NR^, x is 1, and E' and E^ are not linked; or<br>
(5)	E^ is NR^, X is zero, and E' is linked to EI<br>
[00083]	R' and R^ are independently selected from branched C3-C30 hydrocarbyl,<br>
substituted branched C3-C30 hydrocarbyl, heteroatom-containing branched C4-C30 hydrocarbyl, substituted heteroatom-containing branched C4-C30 hydrocarbyl, cyclic C5-C30 hydrocarbyl, substituted cyclic C5-C30 hydrocarbyl, heteroatom-containing cyclic Cj-Cso hydrocarbyl, and substituted heteroatom-containing cyclic C1-C30 hydrocarbyl.   Preferably, at least one of R' and R^, and more preferably both R' and R^, are relatively biilky groups.<br><br>
particularly branched alkyl (including substituted and/or heteroatom-containing alkyl), aryi (including substituted aryl, heteroaiyl, and substituted heteroaryl), alkary! (including substituted and/or heteroatom-containing aralkyl), and alicyclic. Using such sterically bulky groups to protect the highly reactive carbene center has been found to kinetically stabihze singlet carbenes, which are preferred reaction catalysts herein. Particular sterically bulky groups that are suitable as R' and R^ are optionally substituted and/or heteroatom-containing C3-C12 alkyl, tertiary C4-C12 alkyl, C5-C12 aryl, Ce-Cig alkaryl, and C5-Ci2 alicyclic, with Cs-Ci: aryl and C6-C12 alkaryl particularly preferred. The latter substituents are exemplified by phenyl optionally substituted with 1 to 3 substituents selected from lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, and halogen, and thus mclude, for example, p-methylphenyl, 2,6-dimethyIphenyl, and 2,4,6-trimethylphenyl (mesityl).<br>
[00084]	L' and L are linkers containing 1 to 6 spacer atoms, and are independently<br>
selected from heteroatoms, substituted heteroatoms, hydrocarbylene, substituted<br>
hydrocarbylene, heteroatom-containing hydrocarbylene, and substituted heteroatom-<br>
containing hydrocarbylene; and m and n are independently zero or 1, meaning that each of L'<br>
and L^ is optional. Preferred L' and L^ moieties include, by way of example, alkylene,<br>
alkenylene, arylene, aralkylene, any of which may be heteroatom-containing and/or<br>
substituted, or L' and/or I? may be a heteroatom such as O or S, or a substituted heteroatom<br>
such as NH, NR (where R is alkyl, aryl, other hydrocarbyl, etc.), or PR; and<br>
[00085}	In one preferred embodiment, E and E are independently N or NR and are<br>
not linked, such that the carbene is an N-heteroacyclic carbene. In another preferred embodiment, E' and E^ are N, x and y are 1, and E^ and E^ are linked through a linking moiety such that the carbene is an N-heterocyclic carbene. N-heterocycIic carbenes suitable herein include, without limitation, compounds having the structure of formula (II)<br><br>
wherein R', R^, L', I?, m, and n are as defined above for carbenes of formula (I). In carbenes of structural formula (II), L is a hydrocarbylene, substituted hydrocarbylene, heteroatom-containing hydrocarbylene, or substituted heteroatom-containing hydrocarbylene linker,<br><br>
wherein two or more substituents on adjacent atoms within L may be linked to form an additional cyclic group. L is a hydrocarbylene, substituted hydrocarbylene, heteroatom-containing hydrocarbylene, or substituted heteroatom-contaiiiing hydrocarbylene linker, wherein two or more substituents on adjacent atoms within L may be linked to form an additional cyclic group. For example, L may be -CR^R'-CR*R^- or -CR^=CR^-, wherein R\ R^, R^ and R are independently selected from hydrogen, halogen, C1-C12 alkyl, or wherein any two of R , R , R , and R^ may be linked together to form a substituted or unsubstituted, saturated or unsaturated ring.<br>
[00086]	Accordingly, when L is -CR^R'-CR^R^- or -CR^=CR^-, the carbene has the<br>
structure of formula (III)<br><br>
in which q is an optional double bond, s is zero or 1, and 1 is xero or 1, with the proviso that when q is present, s and t are zero, and when q is absent, s and t are 1.<br>
[00087]	Certain carbenes are new chemical compounds and are claimed as such herein.<br>
These are compounds having the structure of formula (I) wherein a heteroatom is directly bound to E' and/or E^. e.g., with the proviso that a heteroatom is directly bound to E', E^, or to both E' and E^, and wlierein the carbene may be m the form of a salt (such that it is positively charged and associated with a negatively charged counterion). These novel carbenes are those wherein a heteroatom is directly bound to E' and/or E , and include, solely r      by way of example, carbenes of formula (I) wherein E and/or E isNR and R is a<br>
heteroalkyl orheteroaryl group such as an alkoxy, alkylthio, aryloxy, arylthio, aralkoxy, or aralkylthio moiety. Other such carbenes are those wherein x and/or y is at least 1, and L and/or \} is heteroalkyl, heteroaryl, or the like, wherein the heteroatom within L^ and/or \} is directly bound to E' and/or E^, respectively.<br>
[00088]	Representative of such novel carbenes are compounds of formula (I) wherein<br>
E' is NR^, and R^ is alkoxy, substituted alkoxy, aryloxy, substituted aryloxy, aralkoxy, or substituted aralkoxy. A preferred subset of such carbenes are those wherein E is N, x is zero, y is 1, and E' and E^ are linked through a substituted or unsubstituted lower alkylene or lower<br><br>
alkenylene linkage. A more preferred subset of such carbenes are those wherein R^ is lower alkoxy or monocyclic aryl-substituted lower alkoxy, E' and E^ are linked through a moiety -CR^R^-CR^R^- or -CR^=CR^-, wherein R^ R\ R^ and R^ are independently selected from hydrogen, halogen, and Ci-Cu alkyl, n is 1, L^ is lower alkylene, and R^ is monocyclic aryl or substituted monocyclic aryl. Examples 8-11 describe syntheses of representative compounds within this group.<br>
[00089]	As indicated previously, suitable catalysts for the present depolymerization<br>
reaction are also precursors to carbenes, preferably precursors to N-heterocyclic and N-heteroacyclic carbenes. In one embodiment, the precursor is a tri-substituted methane compound having the structure of formula (PI)<br><br>
wherein E', E^, X, y, R', R'^, L', L^, m, and n are as defined for carbenes of structural formula<br>
(I), and wherein R' is selected from alkyl, heteroalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, aralkyl, or<br>
heteroaralkyl, and is substituted with at least one electron-withdrawing substituent such as<br>
[00090]	fluoro, fluoroalkyl (including perfluoroalkyl), chloro, nitre, acytyl. It will be<br>
appreciated that the foregoing list is not exhaustive and that any electron-withdrawing group<br>
may serve as a substituent providing that the group does not cause unwanted interaction of<br>
the catalyst with other components of the depolymerization mixture or adversely affect the<br>
depolymerization reaction in any way.   Specific examples of R' groups thus mclude p-<br>
nitrophenyl, 2,4-dinitrobenzyl, 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl, pentafluorophenyl, and the like.<br>
[00091]	Catalysts of formula (PI) are new chemical entities. Representative syntheses<br>
of such compounds are described in Examples 13 and 14 herein. As may be deduced from<br>
those examples, compounds of formula (PI) wherein E' and E^ are N may be synthesized<br>
from the corresponding diamine and an appropriately substituted aldehyde.<br>
[00092]	Another carbene precursor useful as a catalyst in the present depolymerization<br>
reaction has the structure of formula (Pll)<br><br><br>
[00093]	wherein E', E^, X, y, R\ R^ L', V, m, and n are as defined for carbenes of<br>
structural formula (I), M is a metal, e.g., gold, silver, other main group metals, or transition<br>
metals, with Ag, Cu, Ni, Co, and Fe generally preferred, and Ln is a ligand, generally an<br>
anionic or neutral ligand that may or may not be the same as -E'-[(L')m-R']x or -E^-[(L\-<br>
R^]y. Generally, carbene precursors of formula (PII) can be synthesized from a carbene salt<br>
and a metal oxide; see, e.g., the synthesis described in detail in Example 12.<br>
[00094]	Still another carbene precursor suitable as a depolymerization catalyst herein<br>
is a tetrasubstituted olefm having the structure of formula (PHI)<br><br>
[0009S]	wherein: E', E^ X, y, R', R^ L', L^ m, and n are defmed as for carbenes of<br>
structural formula (I); E^ and E^ are defmed as for E' and E^; v and w are defmed as for x and y; R^ and R' are defined as for R' and R^; L^ and L' are defmed as for L' and L^; and h and k are defmed as for m and n. These olefins are readily formed from N,N-diaTyl- and N,N-dialkyl-N-heterocyclic carbene salts and a sfrong base, typically an inorganic base such as a metal alkoxide.<br>
[00096]	As with the carbenesper se, those catalyst precursors having the structure of<br>
formula (PII) or (PHI) in which a heteroatom is directly bound to an "E" moiety, i.e., to E', E^, E^, and/or E"*, are new chemical entities. Preferred such precursors are those wherein the "E" moieties are NR^ or linked N atoms, and the directly boimd heteroatom within R^ is oxygen or suliur.<br>
[00097]	The depolymerization reaction may be carried out in an inert atmosphere by<br>
dissolving a catalytically effective amount of the selected catalyst in a solvent, combining the polymer and the catalyst solution, and then adding the nucleophilic reagent. In a particularly preferred embodiment, however, the polymer, the nucleophilic reagent, and the catalyst (e.g..<br><br>
a carbene or a carbene precursor) are combined and dissolved in a suitable solvent, and depolymerization thus occurs in a one-step reaction.<br>
[00098]	Preferably, the reaction mixture is agitated (e.g., stirred), and the progress of<br>
the reaction can be monitored by standard techniques, although visual inspection is generally<br>
sufficient, insofar as a transparent reaction mixture indicates that the polymer has degraded to<br>
an extent sufficient to allow all degradation products to go into solution. Examples of<br>
solvents that may be used in the polymerization reaction include organic, protic, or aqueous<br>
solvents that are inert under the depolymerization conditions, such as aromatic hydrocarbons,<br>
chlorinated hydrocarbons, ethers, aliphatic hydrocarbons, or mixtures thereof Preferred<br>
solvents include toluene, methylene chloride, tetrahydrofuran, methyl t-butyl ether, Isopar,<br>
gasoline, and mixtures thereof. Supercritical fluids may also be used as solvents, with carbon<br>
dioxide representing one such solvent. Reaction temperatures are in the range of about 0 °C<br>
to about 100 "^C , typically at most 80 °C, preferably 60 °C or lower, and most preferably<br>
30 °C or less, and the reaction time will generally be in the range of about 12 to 24 hours.<br>
Pressures range from atmospheric to pressures typically used in conjunction with<br>
supercritical fluids, with the preferred pressure being atmospheric.<br>
[00099]	It is to be understood that while the invention has been described in<br>
conjunction with the preferred specific embodiments thereof, that the foregoing description as well as the examples that follow are mtended to illustrate and not Ihnit the scope of the invention. Other aspects, advantages and modifications within the scope of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art to which the invention pertains. EXPERIMENTAL:<br>

Aldrich dissolved in CHCI3 and trifluoroacetic acid and precipitated with methanol to form a<br>

with approximately 5 additional mL THF. After 2 hours, the solution became more<br>
transparent, indicating dissolution of the components of the depolymerization mixture. The<br>
admixture was stirred overnight, yielding a completely clear solution the following day. the<br>
THF was removed, yielding 225 mg of white solid. 'H NMR '^C NMR, and GC-MS were all<br>
consistent with bis(hydroxy ethylene) terephthalate.		<br><br><br>
[000107]	Depolymerization of PET according to the above scheme: 25 mg of 1,3-<br>

Methanol (3.11 g) and PET (308 mg, as Jn Example 6) were combined with 5 mL of THF to form an insoluble mixture. The catalyst mixture was filtered into the PET/methanoI mixture. After 1 hour, there was a noticeable increase in transparency. After 14 hours, the solution was completely homogeneous and clear.   The solvent was removed by rotary evaporation to yield a white crystalline product (250 mg). 'H NMR indicated complete conversion to dimethyl terephthalate.<br>
[000108]	Examples 6 and 7 may be better understood by reference to the synthetic route<br>
used to prepare the PET and the possible depolymerization products obtained therefrom. The PET obtained in each example was prepared by synthesis according to a two-step transesterification process from dimethyl teraphthalate (DMT) and excess ethylene glycol (EO) in the presence of a metal alkanoate or acetate of calcium, zinc, manganese, titanium etc. The first step generates bis(hydroxy ethylene) teraphthalate (BHET) with the elimination of methanol and the excess EO. The BHET is heated, generally in the presence of a transesterification catalyst, to generate high polymer. This process is generally accomplished in a vented extruder to remove the polycondensate (EO) and generate the desired thermoformed object from a low viscosity precursor. The reaction takes place according to the following scheme:<br><br><br>
[000109]	The different options for chemical recycling are regeneration of the base<br>
monomers (DMT and EG), glycolysis of PET back to BHET, decomposition of PET with propylene glycol and reaction of the degradation product with maleic anhydride to form "unsaturated polyesters" for fiber reinforced composites and decomposition with glycols, followed by reaction with dicarboxylic acids to produce polyols for urethane foam and elastomers.<br>
[OOOUOj	In Example 7, PET powder was slurried in a THF/methanol solvent mixture.<br>
N-heterocyclic carbene (3-5 mol%), generated in situ, was added and within approximately 3 hours the PET went into solution. Anaylsis of the degradation product indicated quantitative consumption of PET and depolymerization via transesterification to EO and DMT. The DMT is readily recovered by recrystailization, while EO can be recovered by distillation (Figure 1). Alternatively, and as established in Example 6, if EO is used as the alcohol (-50 to 200mol% excess) in the THF slurry, the depolymerization product is BHET, which is the most desirable and can be directly recycled via conventional methods to PET (Figure 2). The N-heterocycIic carbene catalyst platform is extremely powerful, as the nature of the substituents has a pronounced effect on catalyst stability and activity towards different substrates.<br><br><br><br>
