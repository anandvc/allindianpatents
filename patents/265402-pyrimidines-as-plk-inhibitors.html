The present invention relates to new pyrimidines of general formula (1),<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
wherein the groups A, W, X, Y, Z, Ra, Rb, Rc, R1 and R3 have the meanings given in the claims and description, the isomers thereof, processes for preparing these pyrimidines and their use as pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
Background to the invention<br>
Tumour cells wholly or partly elude regulation and control by the body and are characterised by uncontrolled growth. This is due on the one hand to the loss of control proteins such as for example Rb, pi 6, p21 and p53 and also to the activation of so-called accelerators of the cell cycle, the cyclin-dependent kinases.<br>
Studies in model organisms such as Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Drosophila melanogaster or Xenopus laevis as well as investigations in human cells have shown that the transition from the G2 phase to mitosis is regulated by the CDKl/cyclin B kinase (Nurse 1990, Nature 344: 503-508). This kinase, which is also known as "mitosis promoting factor" (MPF), phosphorylates and regulates a plurality of proteins, such as e.g. nuclear lamina, kinesin-like motor proteins, condensins and Golgi Matrix Proteins, which play an important part in the breakdown of the nuclear coat, in centrosome separation, the structure of the mitotic spindle apparatus, chromosome condensation and breakdown of the Golgi apparatus (Nigg. E. 2001, Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol. 2(l):21-32). A murine cell line with a temperature-sensitive CDK-1 kinase mutant shows a rapid breakdown in CDK-1 kinase after temperature increase and a subsequent arrest in the G2/M phase (Th'ng et al. 1990, Cell 63(2):3 13-24). The treatment of human tumour cells with inhibitors against CDKl/cyclin B, such as<br>
e.g. butyrolactone, leads to an arrest in the G2/M phase and subsequent apoptosis (Nishio, et al. \996,Anticancer Res.U(6B):3387-95).<br>
Moreover, the protein kinase Aurora B has also been described as having an essential function during entry into mitosis. Aurora B phosphorylates histone H3 on SerlO and thereby initiates chromosome condensation (Hsu et al. 2000, Cell 102:279-91). A specific cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase may, however, also be initiated e.g. by inhibition of specific phosphatases such as e.g. Cdc25C (Russell and Nurse 1986, Cell 45:145-53). Yeasts with a defective Cdc25 gene arrest in the G2 phase, whereas overexpression of Cdc25 leads to premature entry into the mitosis phase (Russell and Nurse, 1987, Cell 49:559-67). Moreover, an arrest in the G2/M phase may also be initiated by inhibition of specific motor proteins, the so-called kinesins such as for example Eg5 (Mayer et al. 1999, Science 286:971-4), or by microtubuli stabilising or destabilising agents (e.g. colchicin, taxol, etoposide, vinblastine, vincristine) (Schiff and Horwitz 1980, Proc NatlAcadSci USA 77:1561-5).<br>
In addition to the cyclin-dependent and Aurora kinases the so-called polo-like kinases, a small family of serine/threonine kinases, also play an important role in the regulation of the eukaryotic cell cycle. Up till now the polo-like kinases PLK-1, PLK-2, PLK-3 and PLK-4 have been described in the literature. PLK-1 in particular has been found to play a central role in the regulation of the mitosis phase. PLK-1 is responsible for the maturation of the centrosomes, for the activation of phosphatase Cdc25C, as well as for the activation of the Anaphase Promoting Complex (Glover et al. 1998, Genes Dev. 12:3777-87; Qianetal. 2001, Mol Biol Cell. 12:1791-9). The injection of PLK-1 antibodies leads to a G2 arrest in untransformed cells, whereas tumour cells arrest during the mitosis phase (Lane and Nigg 1996, J Cell Biol. 135:1701-13). Overexpression of PLK-1 has been demonstrated in various types of tumour, such as non-small-cell carcinoma of the lung, plate epithelial carcinoma, breast and colorectal carcinoma (Wolf et al. 1997, Oncogene 14:543-549; Knecht etal. 1999, Cancer Res. 59:2794-2797; Wolf etal. 2QQQ,Pathol. Res. Pract. 196:753-759; Takahashi et al. 2003, Cancer Sci. 94:148-52). Therefore, this category of proteins also presents an interesting point of attack for therapeutic intervention in proliferative diseases (Liu and Erikson 2003, Proc NatlAcadSci USA 100:5789-5794).<br>
Pyrimidines are generally known as inhibitors of kinases. Thus, for example, pyrimidines are described as an active component with an anticancer activity in International Patent Application WO 00/53595, which describes the use of 2,4,5-substituted pyrimidines with a heterocyclic group in the 4-position and an anilino group in the 2 position, which in turn comprises a side chain with the length of at least one n-propyl group.<br>
Moreover, International Patent Application WO 00/39101 describes the use of 2,4,5-substituted pyrimidines as compounds with an anticancer activity which are linked in the 2- and 4-position with an aromatic or heteroaromatic ring, at least one of which comprises a side chain with the length of at least one n-propyl group.<br>
International Patent Application WO 97/19065 further proposes the use of 2,4,5-substituted pyrimidines with a 3,4-dialkoxyam'lino group in position 2 as kinase inhibitors.<br>
International Patent Application WO 02/04429 describes 2,4,5-substituted pyrimidines with a cyano group in position 5 and their cell cycle inhibiting effect.<br>
International Patent Application WO 03/063794 describes the use of 2,4-pyrimidinediamines as inhibitors of the IgE and/or IgG receptor signal cascade.<br>
Antiviral 2,4,5-substituted pyrimidines, wherein the groups Rc and Rd form a heteroaromatic five-membered ring at the nitrogen of the 4- position, are known from International Patent Application WO 99/41253.<br>
2,4,5-substituted pyrimidines which carry (hetero)aryls in position 2 and 4 (WOOO/27825) and also 2, 4, 5-substituted pyrimidines which carry a (hetero)aryl group functionalised with a nitrile group in position 2 or 4 (EP 0 945 443 Al) are described as having an antiviral activity.<br>
The resistance of many types of tumour demands that new drugs be developed to fight the tumours. The aim of the present invention is therefore to indicate new active<br>
substances which may be used for the prevention and/or treatment of diseases characterised by excessive or anomalous cell proliferation.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
It has now been found that, surprisingly, compounds of general formula (1), wherein the groups A, W, X, Y, Ra, Rb, Rc, R1, R2 and R3 are defined as hereinafter, act as inhibitors of specific cell cycle kinases. Thus, the compounds according to the invention may be used for example for the treatment of diseases associated with the activity of specific cell cycle kinases and characterised by excessive or anomalous cell proliferation.<br>

Biological properties<br>
As demonstrated by DNA staining followed by FACS analysis, the inhibition of proliferation brought about by the compounds according to the invention is mediated above all by the arrest of the cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. The cells arrest, depending on the type of cell used, for a specific length of time in this cell cycle phase before programmed cell death is initiated. An arrest in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle may be initiated e.g. by the inhibition of specific cell cycle kinases. On the basis of their biological properties the compounds of general formula I according to the invention, their isomers and the physiologically acceptable salts thereof are suitable for treating diseases characterised by excessive or anomalous cell proliferation.<br>
Such diseases include for example: viral infections (e.g. HIV and Kaposi's sarcoma); inflammatory and autoimmune diseases (e.g. colitis, arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, glomerulonephritis and wound healing); bacterial, fungal and/or parasitic infections; leukaemias, lymphomas and solid tmours; skin diseases (e.g. psoriasis); bone diseases;<br>
cardiovascular diseases (e.g. restenosis and hypertrophy). They are also useful for protecting proliferating cells (e.g. hair, intestinal, blood and progenitor cells) from DNA damage caused by radiation, UV treatment and/or cytostatic treatment (Davis et al., 2001). The new compounds may be used for the prevention, short- or long-term treatment of the above-mentioned diseases, also in combination with other active substances used for the same indications, e.g. cytostatics, steroids or antibodies.<br>
The activity of the compounds according to the invention on various kinases, for example on serine-threonine kinase PLK-1, was determined by in vitro kinase assays with recombinantly produced protein. In this assay the compounds exhibit a good to very good effect on PLK1, i.e. for example an IC50 value of less than 1 umol/L, usually less than 0.1 umol/L.<br>
Example PLK-1 Kinaseassay<br>
Recombinant human PLK1 enzyme linked to GST at its N-terminal end is isolated from insect cells infected with baculovirus (Sf21). Purification is carried out by affinity chromatography on glutathione sepharose columns.<br>
4xl07 Sf21 cells (Spodoptera frugiperdd) in 200 ml of Sf-900 II Serum free insect cell medium (Life Technologies) are seeded in a spinner flask. After 72 hours' incubation at<br>
o<br>
27°C and 70 rpm, 1x10 Sf21 cells are seeded in a total of 180 ml medium in a new spinner flask. After another 24 hours, 20 ml of recombinant Baculovirus stock suspension are added and the cells are cultivated for 72 hours at 27°C at 70 rpm. 3 hours before harvesting, okadaic acid is added (Calbiochem, final concentration 0.1 (j,M) and the suspension is incubated further. The cell number is determined, the cells are removed by centrifuging (5 minutes, 4°C, 800 rpm) and washed Ix with PBS (8 g NaCl/1, 0.2 g KC1/1, 1.44 g Na2HPO4/l, 0.24 g KH2PO4/1). After centrifuging again the pellet is flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Then the pellet is quickly thawed and resuspended in ice-cold lysing buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 5 ug/ml leupeptin, 5 ug/ml aprotinin, 100 uM NaF, 100 uM PMSF, 10 mM B-glycerolphosphate, 0.1 mM Na3VO4, 30 mM 4-nitrophenylphosphate) to give IxlO8 cells/17.5 ml. The cells are lysed for 30 minutes on<br>
ice. After removal of the cell debris by centrifugation (4000 rpm, 5 minutes) the clear supernatant is combined with glutathione sepharose beads (1 ml resuspended and washed beads per 50 ml of supernatant) and the mixture is incubated for 30 minutes at 4°C on a rotating board. Then the beads are washed with lysing buffer and the recombinant protein is eluted from the beads with 1 ml eluting buffer/ ml resuspended beads (eluting buffer: 100 mM Tris/HCl pH-8.0, 120 mM NaCl, 20 mM reduced glutathione (Sigma G-4251), 10 mM MgCb, 1 mM DTT). The protein concentration is determined by Bradford Assay.<br>

-10 ul ATP solution (45 uM ATP with 1.1 IxlO6 Bq/ml gamma-P33-ATP). The reaction is started by adding the ATP solution and continued for 45 minutes at 30 °C with gentle shaking (650 rpm on an IKA Schuttler MTS2). The reaction is stopped by the addition of 125 ^1 of ice-cold 5% TCA per well and incubated on ice for at least 30 minutes. The precipitate is transferred by harvesting onto filter plates (96-well microtitre filter plate: UniFilter-96, GF/B; Packard; No.6005177), then washed four times with 1% TCA and dried at 60°C. After the addition of 35ul scintillation solution (Ready-Safe; Beckmann) per well the plate is sealed shut with sealing tape and the amount of P33 precipitated is measured with the Wallac Betacounter. The measured data are evaluated using the standard Graphpad software (Levenburg-Marquard Algorhythmus).<br>
The anti-proliferative activity of the compounds according to the invention is determined in the cytotoxicity test on cultivated human tumour cells and/or in a FACS analysis, for<br>
example on HeLa S3 cells. In both test methods the compounds exhibit good to very good activity, i.e. for example an EC50 value in the HeLa S3 cytotoxicity test of less than 5 umol/L, generally less than 1 umol/L.<br>
Measurement of cytotoxicity on cultivated human tumour cells<br>
To measure cytotoxicity on cultivated human tumour cells, cells of cervical carcinoma tumour cell line HeLa S3 (obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)) are cultivated in Ham's F12 Medium (Life Technologies) and 10% foetal calf serum (Life Technologies) and harvested in the log growth phase. Then the HeLa S3 cells are placed in 96-well plates (Costar) at a density of 1000 cells per well and incubated overnight in an incubator (at 37°C and 5 % CO2), while on each plate 6 wells are filled with medium alone (3 wells as the medium control, 3 wells for incubation with reduced AlamarBlue reagent). The active substances are added to the cells in various concentrations (dissolved in DMSO; DMSO final concentration: 0.1%) (in each case as a triple measurement). After 72 hours incubation 20 jil AlamarBlue reagent (AccuMed International) are added to each well, and the cells are incubated for a further 5-7 hours. As a control, 20 ul reduced AlamarBlue reagent is added to each of 3 wells (AlamarBlue reagent, which is autoclaved for 30 min). After incubation the colour change of the AlamarBlue reagent in the individual wells is determined in a Perkin Elmer fluorescence spectrophotometer (excitation 530 nm, emission 590 nm, slits 15, integrate time 0.1). The amount of AlamarBlue reagent reacted represents the metabolic activity of the cells. The relative cell activity is calculated as a percentage of the control (HeLa S3 cells without inhibitor) and the active substance concentration which inhibits the cell activity by 50% (IC50) is derived. The values are calculated from the average of three individual measurements - with correction of the dummy value (medium control).<br>
FACS Analysis<br>
Propidium iodide (PI) binds stoichiometrically to double-stranded DNA, and is thus suitable for determining the proportion of cells in the Gl, S, and G2/M phase of the cell cycle on the basis of the cellular DNA content. Cells in the GO and Gl phase have a<br>
diploid DNA content (2N), whereas cells in the G2 or mitosis phase have a 4N DNA content.<br>
For PI staining, for example, IxlO6 HeLa S3 cells are seeded onto a 75 cm2 cell culture flask, and after 24 h either 0.1 % DMSO is added as control or the substance is added in various concentrations (in 0.1% DMSO). The cells are incubated for 24 h with the substance or with DMSO before the cells are washed 2 x with PBS and then detached with trypsin /EDTA. The cells are centrifuged (1000 rpm, 5 min, 4°C), and the cell pellet is washed 2 x with PBS before the cells are resuspended in 0.1 ml PBS. Then the cells are fixed with 80% ethanol for 16 hours at 4°C or alternatively for 2 hours at -20°C. The fixed cells are centrifuged (1000 rpm, 5min, 4°C), washed with PBS and then centrifuged again. The cell pellet is resuspended in 2 ml 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS, and incubated on ice for 5 min before 5 ml PBS are added and the mixture is centrifuged again. The cell pellet is resuspended in 350 ul PI staining solution (0.1 mg/ml RNase A (Sigma, No. R-4875), 10 l-ig/ml prodium iodide (Sigma, No. P-4864) in 1 x PBS). The cells are incubated for 20 min in the dark with the staining buffer before being transferred into sample measuring containers for the FACS scan. The DNA measurement is carried out in a Becton Dickinson FACS Analyzer, with an argon laser (500 mW, emission 488 nm), and the DNA Cell Quest Programme (BD). The logarithmic PI fluorescence is determined with a band-pass filter (BP 585/42). The cell populations in the individual cell cycle phases are quantified using the ModFit LT Programme made by Becton Dickinson.<br>
The compounds according to the invention are also tested accordingly for other tumour cells. For example, these compounds are effective on carcinomas of all kinds of tissue (e.g. breast (MCF7); colon (HCT116), head and neck (FaDu), lung (NCI-H460), pancreas (BxPC-3), prostate (DU145)), sarcomas (e.g. SK-UT-1B), leukaemias and lymphomas (e.g. HL-60; Jurkat, THP-1) and other tumours (e.g. melanomas (BRO), gliomas (U-87MG)) and could be used for such indications. This is evidence of the broad applicability of the compounds according to the invention for the treatment of all kinds of tumour types.The compounds of general formula (I) may be used on their own or in conjunction with other active substances according to the invention, optionally also in conjunction with other pharmacologically active substances.<br>
Suitable preparations include for example tablets, capsules, suppositories, solutions, particularly solutions for injection (s.c., i.v., i.m.) and infusion, elixirs, emulsions or dispersible powders. The content of the pharrnaceutically active compound(s) should be in the range from 0.1 to 90 wt.-%, preferably 0.5 to 50 wt.-% of the composition as a whole, i.e. in amounts which are sufficient to achieve the dosage range specified below. The doses specified may, if necessary, be given several times a day.<br>
Suitable tablets may be obtained, for example, by mixing the active substance(s) with known excipients, for example inert diluents such as calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or lactose, disintegrants such as corn starch or alginic acid, binders such as starch or gelatine, lubricants such as magnesium stearate or talc and/or agents for delaying release, such as carboxymethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate phthalate, or polyvinyl acetate. The tablets may also comprise several layers.<br>
Coated tablets may be prepared accordingly by coating cores produced analogously to the tablets with substances normally used for tablet coatings, for example collidone or shellac, gum arabic, talc, titanium dioxide or sugar. To achieve delayed release or prevent incompatibilities the core may also consist of a number of layers. Similarly the tablet coating may consist of a number or layers to achieve delayed release, possibly using the excipients mentioned above for the tablets.<br>
Syrups or elixirs containing the active substances or combinations thereof according to the invention may additionally contain a sweetener such as saccharine, cyclamate, glycerol or sugar and a flavour enhancer, e.g. a flavouring such as vanillin or orange extract. They may also contain suspension adjuvants or thickeners such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, wetting agents such as, for example, condensation products of fatty alcohols with ethylene oxide, or preservatives such as p-hydroxybenzoates.<br>
Solutions for injection and infusion are prepared in the usual way, e.g. with the addition of isotonic agents, preservatives such as p-hydroxybenzoates, or stabilisers such as alkali metal salts of ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, optionally using emulsifiers and/or dispersants, whilst if water is used as the diluent, for example, organic solvents may optionally be used as solvating agents or dissolving aids, and transferred into injection vials or ampoules or infusion bottles.<br>
Capsules containing one or more active substances or combinations of active substances may for example be prepared by mixing the active substances with inert carriers such as lactose or sorbitol and packing them into gelatine capsules.<br>
Suitable suppositories may be made for example by mixing with carriers provided for this purpose, such as neutral fats or polyethyleneglycol or the derivatives thereof. Excipients which may be used include, for example, water, pharmaceuticaHy acceptable organic solvents such as paraffins (e.g. petroleum fractions), vegetable oils (e.g. groundnut or sesame oil), mono- or polyfunctional alcohols (e.g. ethanol or glycerol), carriers such as e.g. natural mineral powders (e.g. kaolins, clays, talc, chalk), synthetic mineral powders (e.g. highly dispersed silicic acid and silicates), sugars (e.g. cane sugar, lactose and glucose) emulsifiers (e.g. lignin, spent sulphite liquors, methylcellulose, starch and polyvinylpyrrolidone) and lubricants (e.g. magnesium stearate, talc, stearic acid and sodium lauryl sulphate).<br>
The preparations are administered by the usual methods, preferably by oral or transdermal route, most preferably by oral route. For oral administration the tablets may, of course contain, apart from the abovementioned carriers, additives such as sodium citrate, calcium carbonate and dicalcium phosphate together with various additives such as starch, preferably potato starch, gelatine and the like. Moreover, lubricants such as magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulphate and talc may be used at the same time for the tabletting process. In the case of aqueous suspensions the active substances may be combined with various flavour enhancers or colourings in addition to the excipients mentioned above.<br>
For parenteral use, solutions of the active substances with suitable liquid carriers may be<br>
used.<br>
The dosage for intravenous use is from 1 -1000 mg per hour, preferably between 5 and<br>
500 mg per hour.<br>
However, it may sometimes be necessary to depart from the amounts specified, depending on the body weight, the route of administration, the individual response to the drug, the nature of its formulation and the time or interval over which the drug is administered. Thus, in some cases it may be sufficient to use less than the minimum dose given above, whereas in other cases the upper limit may have to be exceeded. When administering large amounts it may be advisable to divide them up into a number of smaller doses spread over the day.<br>
The formulation examples which follow illustrate the present invention without restricting its scope:<br>
The finely ground active substance, lactose and some of the corn starch are mixed together. The mixture is screened, then moistened with a solution of polyvinylpyrrolidone in water, kneaded, wet-granulated and dried. The granules, the remaining corn starch and the magnesium stearate are screened and mixed together. The mixture is compressed to produce tablets of suitable shape and size.<br>
The finely ground active substance, some of the corn starch, lactose, microcrystalline cellulose and polyvinylpyrrolidone are mixed together, the mixture is screened and worked with the remaining corn starch and water to form a granulate which is dried and screened. The sodiurncarboxymethyl starch and the magnesium stearate are added and mixed in and the mixture is compressed to form tablets of a suitable size.<br>
The active substance is dissolved in water at its own pH or optionally at pH 5.5 to 6.5 and sodium chloride is added to make it isotonic. The solution obtained is filtered free from pyrogens and the filtrate is transferred under aseptic conditions into ampoules which are then sterilised and sealed by fusion. The ampoules contain 5 mg, 25 mg and 50 mg of active substance.<br><br><br>
