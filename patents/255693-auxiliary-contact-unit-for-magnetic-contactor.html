AUXILIARY CONTACT UNIT FOR MAGNETIC CONTACTOR<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an auxiliary contact unit<br>
for a magnetic contactor, and more particularly, to an<br>
auxiliary contact unit securely attachable to a magnetic<br>
contactor.<br>
2.	Description of the Conventional Art<br>
Generally, a magnetic contactor is connected to a wire<br>
connected to a system, and opens and closes a circuit on<br>
the system. An auxiliary contact unit is used along with<br>
the magnetic contactor and functions to open and close a<br>
weak current or a low level current employed for, for<br>
example, a control signal.<br><br>
The auxiliary contact unit is typically attachable to a<br>
lateral surface or an upper surface of the magnetic<br>
contactor, and a certain magnetic contactor has a built-in<br>
auxiliary contact unit. A movable unit of an auxiliary<br>
contact unit is attached to a magnetic contactor and at the<br>
same time is connected to a movable unit of the magnetic<br>
contactor to open and close a contact point of the<br>
auxiliary contact unit in response to opening/closing<br>
operation of the magnetic contactor, and to turn on and<br>
turn off the current flowing in the auxiliary contact unit.<br>
One of the methods of attaching an auxiliary contact unit<br>
to a magnetic contactor is a snap-fit connection method,<br>
but, in order to obtain a secure attachment, a screw or a<br>
bolt/nut are used. Regardless of the attachment methods, an<br>
auxiliary contact unit must be securely attached to a<br>
magnetic contactor in order to withstand or absorb<br>
vibrations and shocks that might be involved with opening<br>
and closing of the magnetic contactor.<br><br>
Hereunder, configuration of the conventional auxiliary<br>
contact unit, and an attachment method of an auxiliary<br>
contact unit to a magnetic contactor will be described with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
FIG.1 is a perspective view illustrating a magnetic<br>
contactor attached with an auxiliary contact unit according<br>
to prior art. FIG.2 is a schematic diagram illustrating an<br>
auxiliary contact unit according to the prior art, and<br>
FIG. 3 is a perspective view illustrating a conventional<br>
magnetic contactor.<br>
Referring to FIG.l, a magnetic contactor (10) is attached<br>
at one side thereof with an auxiliary contact unit (20) ,<br>
where the auxiliary contact unit is attached across a part<br>
of an upper frame and a lower frame of the magnetic<br>
contactor. At this time, the auxiliary contact unit (20) is<br>
equipped with a plurality of hooks and lugs at an<br>
attachment frame thereof to which the magnetic contactor<br>
(10) is attached, as shown in FIG.2.<br><br>
In other words, a frame of the auxiliary contact unit (20)<br>
is lengthwise provided at an upper surface thereof with a<br>
cross-bar lug insertion groove (22) from which a cross-bar<br>
lug (21) of the auxiliary contact unit (20) is protruded<br>
for vertical movement, and the cross-bar lug insertion<br>
groove (22) is formed at left and right sides thereof with<br>
upper hooks (23) . Furthermore, the frame of the auxiliary<br>
contact unit (20) is provided at left and right lower<br>
surfaces thereof with fixed lugs (25) and further down<br>
there are formed with lower hooks (27).<br>
Referring now to FIG.3, the magnetic contactor (10) is<br>
formed with grooves at positions corresponding to the<br>
plurality of hooks and lugs provided at the auxiliary<br>
contact unit (20) . In other words, upper hook insertion<br>
grooves (13) into which the cross-bar insertion groove (11)<br>
and the upper hooks (23) are inserted are formed at an<br>
upper frame of the magnetic contactor (10), while fixed lug<br>
insertion grooves (15) into which the fixed lugs (25) of<br><br>
the auxiliary contact unit (20) are inserted, and lower<br>
hook insertion grooves (17) into which the lower hooks (27)<br>
are inserted, are formed at a lower frame of the magnetic<br>
contactor (10) .<br>
Accordingly, the auxiliary contact unit (20) can be<br>
attached to the magnetic contactor (10) by inserting the<br>
cross-bar lug (21) inserted into an interior of the<br>
auxiliary contact unit (20) into the cross-bar lug<br>
insertion groove (11) of the magnetic contactor (10) , and<br>
inserting the upper hooks (23), the fixed lugs (25) and the<br>
lower hooks (27) into the upper hook insertion grooves (13),<br>
the fixed lug insertion grooves (15) and the lower hook<br>
insertion grooves (17) respectively.<br>
At this time, the auxiliary contact unit (20) can be easily<br>
attached to the magnetic contactor (10) by the elastic<br>
force of a compression spring disposed at a lower inside<br>
thereof, the detailed explanation of which will be given<br>
with reference to FIGS. 4a and 4b.<br><br>
FIG.4a is a lower horizontal cross-sectional view of an<br>
auxiliary contact unit according to prior art, FIG.4b is a<br>
schematic view of a spring cover and a lower hook applied<br>
to an auxiliary contact unit according to the prior art and<br>
FIG.4c is a schematic view in which the spring cover of<br>
FIG.4a is removed.<br>
Throughout the drawings, elements, parts or portions<br>
similar to or corresponding to those in FIG.1 to FIG.3 are<br>
designated by like reference numerals.<br>
As illustrated in the drawings, the lower hooks (27) are<br>
connected to a cover (28), and the cover (28) is installed<br>
thereunder with a compression spring (29) . The auxiliary<br>
contact unit (20) can be easily attached to the magnetic<br>
contactor (10) by inserting the lower hooks (27) of the<br>
auxiliary contact unit (20) to the lower hook insertion<br>
grooves (17) of the magnetic contactor (10) and using the<br>
elastic force of the cover (28) and the compression spring<br>
(29) .<br><br>
However, the conventional auxiliary contact unit attachable<br>
according to the above method suffers from a number of<br>
shortcomings that make it inefficient, for example but not<br>
limited thereto, in retaining attachment force thereof.<br>
In other words, although the compression spring facilitates<br>
the attachment of the auxiliary contact unit to the<br>
magnetic contactor, and serves to support an auxiliary<br>
contact and protects the auxiliary contact against shocks<br>
or vibrations caused by continued ON/OFF operations of the<br>
magnetic contactor, the elastic force of the compression<br>
spring comes to deteriorate as time passes and the ON/OFF<br>
operations continue, thereby weakening the support strong<br>
enough to retain the attachment force of the auxiliary<br>
contact unit.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is disclosed to solve the<br><br>
aforementioned problems and it is an object of the present<br>
invention to provide an auxiliary contact unit for a<br>
magnetic contactor adapted to replace a compression spring<br>
with an elastic protrusion and let it to support a cover,<br>
thereby minimizing deterioration of the attachment force of<br>
the auxiliary contact unit at the magnetic contactor as<br>
time passes and the ON/OFF operations of the magnetic<br>
contactor continue.<br>
To achieve these and other advantages and in accordance<br>
with the purpose of the present invention, as embodied and<br>
broadly described herein, there is provided an auxiliary<br>
contact unit for a magnetic contactor, comprising: a cover<br>
disposed inside a lower frame of the auxiliary contact unit,<br>
and connected to lower hooks supporting an upper structure;<br>
and a protrusion formed either at a lower end surface of<br>
the cover or a bottom surface of the lower frame for<br>
supporting a lower surface of the cover.<br>
Preferably, the protrusion is so disposed as to support a<br><br>
central lower end surface of the cover, and more preferably,<br>
at least more than two protrusions are disposed on the<br>
lower end surface of the cover, each protrusion spaced a<br>
predetermined distance apart, so that force can be equally<br>
distributed. The protrusion is preferred to be made of<br>
elastic material.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred<br>
embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are<br>
illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Hereinafter, an<br>
auxiliary contact unit for a magnetic contactor according<br>
to the present invention will be described with reference<br>
to the attached drawings.<br>
FIG.5a is an enlarged lateral view of an attachment surface<br>
of a magnetic contactor on which an auxiliary contact unit<br>
according to the present invention is attached and upper<br>
hook insertion grooves, and FIG.5b is a partial cut-away<br><br>
view of a lower frame of a magnetic contactor to which an<br>
auxiliary contact unit according to the present invention<br>
is attached and an enlarged view of an upper hook insertion<br>
groove. Hereinafter, elements, parts or portions similar to<br>
or corresponding to those in FIG.1 to FIG.4 are designated<br>
by like reference numerals.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5a, a magnetic contactor (10) is formed<br>
at an upper frame thereof with upper hook insertion grooves<br>
(13) into which upper hooks (23) disposed at an auxiliary<br>
contact unit (20) are inserted, and a cross-bar lug<br>
insertion groove (11) into which a cross-bar lug (21) is<br>
inserted. The magnetic contactor (10) is further formed at<br>
a lower frame thereof with lower hook insertion grooves<br>
(17) into which lower hooks (27) of the auxiliary contact<br>
unit (20) are inserted, and fixed lug insertion grooves<br>
(15) into which fixed lugs (25) are inserted.<br>
Now, referring to an enlarged view of FIG. 5a, each upper<br>
hook insertion grooves (13) is formed therein with an<br><br>
inclined surface (13a), the shape of which corresponds to<br>
that of the upper hook so that the upper hook is prevented<br>
from being easily unhooked from the upper hook insertion<br>
groove (13) once the upper hook is inserted into the groove.<br>
Now, referring to an enlarged view of FIG. 5b, each lower<br>
hook insertion groove (17) into which the lower hook (27)<br>
is inserted is formed with a hitching groove (17a) so that<br>
the crooked lower hook is prevented from being easily<br>
unhooked once the lower hook is inserted into the groove.<br>
Therefore, if the auxiliary contact unit (20) is attached<br>
to the magnetic contactor (10), the upper hook (23) is<br>
inserted into the upper hook insertion groove (13) to be<br>
hitched at the inclined surface (13a) of the upper hook<br>
insertion groove, and the lower hook (27) is hitched at the<br>
hitching groove (17a) to enable the auxiliary contact unit<br>
(20) to be securely attached to the magnetic contactor (10).<br>
Meanwhile, the magnetic contactor (10) is insertedly<br><br>
disposed at an inner upper frame thereof with a cross-bar<br>
(19) illustrated in FIG. 6.<br>
FIG. 6 is a perspective view of the cross-bar disposed<br>
within a magnetic contactor to which an auxiliary contact<br>
unit is attached according to the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG.6, the cross-bar (19) is laterally formed<br>
with a cross-bar lug insertion groove (19a) into which the<br>
cross-bar lug (21) of the auxiliary contact unit (20) is<br>
inserted, and the cross-bar lug insertion groove (19a) is<br>
situated at a place corresponding to that of the cross-bar<br>
lug insertion groove (11) formed at the upper frame of the<br>
magnetic contactor when the cross-bar is installed inside<br>
the magnetic contactor (10).<br>
However, as there is a problem of the auxiliary contact<br>
unit (20) being weakened in its attachment force to the<br>
magnetic contactor (10) due to continued ON/OFF operations<br>
of the magnetic contactor (10), a protrusion (100) is<br><br>
installed at a position of a compression spring disposed, at<br>
a lower end of the auxiliary contact unit (20) as<br>
illustrated in FIG.7 to thereby allow supporting the cover<br>
(28 of FIG.8). Here, FIG.7 is an exploded perspective view<br>
and partial enlarged view of an auxiliary contact unit<br>
according to the present invention.<br>
In other words, the compression spring tends to weaken in<br>
its elastic force due to frequent ON/OFF operations of the<br>
magnetic contactor and lapse of time, such that the<br>
protrusion (100) made of elastic material have replaced the<br>
compression spring in the present invention, thereby<br>
enabling to minimize the weakness of the attachment force<br>
of the auxiliary contact unit (20) caused by the decreased<br>
elastic force.<br>
Therefore, the elastic force of the crooked lower hook (27)<br>
is mainly used for attachment of the auxiliary contact unit<br>
(20) to the magnetic contactor (10) in the present<br>
invention, whereas elastic force of the cover (28) is<br><br>
employed as an auxiliary thereto. The protrusion (100)<br>
serves to support the cover (28) and to allow the cover<br>
(28) to maintain a predetermined height lest the cover (28)<br>
should droop, such that the cover (28) can be more stably<br>
supported than with two or more protrusions formed as shown<br>
in the enlarged drawing of FIG.7.<br>
However, as the scope of right of the present invention, is<br>
not affected by the number or the position of protrusions,<br>
it would make no difference to allow a different type of<br>
protrusion (110) to be installed at a lower end of the<br>
cover (28) as shown in FIG.8. In other words, the<br>
protrusion may be integrally molded to a lower end of the<br>
cover (28), or integrally molded to an inner lower frame of<br>
the auxiliary contact unit, to be more specific, to a<br>
bottom surface of the lower frame, and may be formed in as<br>
many numbers as needed. Here, FIG.8 is a longitudinal<br>
cross-sectional view of a lower auxiliary contact unit<br>
according to the present invention.<br><br>
As apparent from the foregoing, there is an advantage in<br>
the auxiliary contact unit for a magnetic contactor<br>
according to the present invention thus described in that,<br>
unlike the conventional technique, the auxiliary contact<br>
unit is structurally changed to thereby remove the<br>
comprehension of a cover losing the elastic force as time<br>
passes and the ON/OFF operations continue, and the support<br>
force of the cover further increases to minimize the<br>
weakness of attachment force of the auxiliary contact unit.<br>
As the present invention may be embodied in several forms<br>
without departing from the spirit or essential<br>
characteristics thereof, it should also be understood that<br>
the above-described embodiments are not limited by any of<br>
the details of the foregoing description, unless otherwise<br>
specified, but rather should be construed broadly within<br>
its spirit and scope as defined in the appended claims, and<br>
therefore all changes and modifications that fall within<br>
the metes and bounds of the claims, or equivalence of such<br>
metes and bounds are therefore intended to be embraced by<br><br>
the appended claims.<br>
According to the present invention, a molded protrusion<br>
replaces a compression spring of the auxiliary contact unit<br>
to support a cover, such that there is no problem of the<br>
cover losing the elastic force as time passes and the<br>
ON/OFF operations of the magnetic contactor continue, and<br>
deterioration of the attachment force of the auxiliary<br>
contact unit at the magnetic contactor can be minimized as<br>
support force of the cover is further improved.<br><br><br>
