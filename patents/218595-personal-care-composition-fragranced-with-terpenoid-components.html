TERPENOID FRASRANCB COMPONENTS STABILIZED WITH MALONIC ACID SALTE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention concerns personal care compositions fragranced with terpenoid components stabilized against degradation.<br>
The Related Art<br>
Terpenes are widespread in nature, mainly in plants as constituents of essential oils. Many terpenes are hydrocarbons, but oxygen-containing compounds such as alcohols, aldehydes or ketones (terpenoids) are also found. Their building block is the hydrocarbon isoprene, CH2=C(CH3)-CH=CH2 {isoprene rule, Wallach. 1887). Terpene hydrocarbons therefore have molecular formulas (C5H6)n, they are classified according to the number of isoprene units: monoterpenes (n=2), sesquiterpenes (n=3), diterpenes (n=4), triterpenes (n=6) and tetraterpenes (n=8).                                                      Examples of monoterpenes are: pinene, nerol, citral, camphor, geraniol and limpnene. Examples of sesquiterpenes are: nerolidol and farnesol.  Squalene is an example of a triterpene.<br>
The term "terpenoid", for purposes of the present invention, is intended to cover terpenes and oxygen containing derivatives thereof having at least one C5H6 hydrocarbyl unit which may have one or more points of unsaturation and/or be part of a cyclic unit within the chemical structure.<br>
Terpenoids are a fragrance raw material of many perfumes and scents. Fragrance terpenoids are disclosed in Arctander, S., Perfume and Flavor" Chemicals, Vol. I and II, Allured Pub. Co.  (1969)  and<br><br>
WO 2004/082652	PCT/EP2004/002558<br>
examples include Ambregris odour chemicals, Jasmones, Musks, Pyran-derivatives, and Sandalwood fragrance chemicals.<br>
It is well known that mixtures of perfume or fragrance raw materials when deposited on a surface or when incorporated in a personal care composition lose intensity and may change character with time, due to many factors. Many attempts have been made to minimize these drawbacks, but so far with minimal success. For example, Gardlick et al, U.S. Patent No. 6,147,037 relates to fragrance delivery systems useful in delivering sustained or enduring fragrances to personal care items.<br>
One factor responsible for loss of fragrance intensity or change in character is that terpenoids are oxidatively unstable. The degree of oxidative instability depends on the degree of unsaturation, or the number of double or triple bonds in the organic compound.<br>
Oxidative instability is an undesirable characteristic in terpenoids. There is a need, therefore, for an agent that will stabilize terpenoids against oxidation. In particular, there is a need for an agent that will prevent the oxidation of terpenoids which have at least one double bond in its chemical structure.<br>
SUMMARY OP THE INVENTION<br>
A personal care composition is provided which includes:<br>
(i) from about 0.001 to about 10% of a fragrance by weight of the composition which includes from about 0.000001 to about 90% of a terpenoid by weight of the fragrance;<br>
(ii) from about 0.0001 to about 30% by weight of the composition of a salt of malonic acid; and .<br>
(iii) from about 1 to about 99% by weight of the composition of a cosmetically acceptable carrier.<br><br>
WO 2004/082652	PCT/EP2004/002558<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
We have now found that salts of malonic acid are effective at stabilizing terpenoid fragrance components against degradation.<br>
A wide variety of counter cations to the malonate anions may be<br>
utilized in forming the salt. Malonate salts may either be the half<br>
or fully neutralized malonic acid or combinations thereof as<br>
represented by general formulas (I) and (II) :	<br>
[HO2CCH2CO2]" [X] * "	+ [X] 2 [02CCH2C02] -2<br>
I	II<br>
wherein X is a cationic counterion.<br>
Suitable cationic counterions include those of alkali and alkaline earth metals. Representative examples include the cations of lithium, sodium," potassium, magnesium," calcium, ammonium and combinations thereof.<br>
Not only inorganic but also organic cations can be employed. Particularly useful are guaternized nitrogen cations having from 1 to 1,000, preferably from 1 to 20, and optimally from 3"~to 12 carbon atoms. Illustrative are those cations derived from amines which include triethanolamine, diethanolamine, propanolamine, monoethanplamine, methylamine, ethylamine, propylamine, isopropylamine, butylamine, isobutylamine, t-butylamihe, pentylamine, isopentylamine, hexylamine, eyelohexylamine, cyclopentylamine, norbornylarnine, octylamine, ethylhexylamine, nonylamine, decylamine, pyrrolidone, amino acids (lysine, arginine, alanine, glutamine, histidine, glycine), 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol, dimethylethanolamine, polyethyleneimine, tris (hydroxymethyl)amino methane and combinations thereof. Most preferred are the cations derived from ammonia, dimethylethanolamine<br><br>
WO 2004/082652	PCT/EP2004/002558<br>
and tris (hydroxymethyl) amino methane.   Typical malonate  salts derived from these preferred materials include ammonium malonate, diammonium    malonate,    dimethylethanolammonium    malonate, bis (dimethylethanolammonium) malonate,     tris (hydroxymethyl) methane ammonium    malonate,     and     di [tris(hydroxymethyl)methane ammonium] malonate.<br>
Amounts of the malonic acid salt may range from about 0.0001 to about 30%, preferably from about 0.1 to about 15%, more preferably from about 0.5 to about 10%, optimally from about 1 to about 8% by weight of the cosmetic composition.<br>
The present invention can utilize as the active ingredient salt I, salt II or mixtures of these salts. When mixtures are present the molar ratio of mono-salt I to di-salt II may range from about 1000:1 to about 1:1000, preferably from about 10:1 to about 1:500, more preferably from about 2:1 to about 1:200, optimally from about 1:1 to about 1:20.    .<br>
The term "personal care composition"  is intended to describe products for topical application to human skin, including leave-on and wash-off products.  Illustrative examples include skin creams, and lotions, hair treatments such as shampoos, depilatories, shaving creams, ant^iperspirants and deodorants and shower gels.<br>
The term "fragrance" is intended to mean one, but preferably two, or more fragrance raw materials which are artfully combined to impart a pleasurable scent, odor, essence, or fragrance characteristic.<br>
As used herein, the term "unsaturation" is intended to describe an organic compound having double or triple bonds, such as olefin or am alkyne.<br>
Terpene- derivatives within each of the three classes include alcohols, ethers, aldehydes, acetals, acids, ketones, esters, and<br><br>
WO 2004/082652	PCT7EP2004/002558<br><br>
terpene compounds that contain heteroatoms such as nitrogen or sulfur.<br>

Fragrances of the present invention advantageously will have terpenoid ingredients with.boiling points of 250°C or lower.  In some<br><br>
WO 2004/082652	PCT/EP2004/002558<br>
instances a fragrance is required to be an enduring one. In those circumstances, the fragrance composition preferably has at least about 4 0% of the terpenoids that exhibit a ClogP equal or greater than 3.0 and a boiling point equal or greater than 250°C. See U.S. Patent 5,540,853 (Trinh et al.) with regard to definitions of these parameters.<br>
Compositions of this invention will also include a cosmetically acceptable carrier. Amounts of the carrier may range from about 1 to about 99.9%, preferably from about 70 to about 95%, optimally from about 80 to about 90% by weight of the composition. Among the useful carriers are water, emollients, fatty acids, fatty alcohols, humectants, thickeners and combinations thereof. The carrier may be aqueous, anhydrous or an emulsion. Preferably the compositions are aqueous, especially water and oil emulsions of the W/0 or O/W or triplex W/O/W variety.

TABLE VII<br><br>
EXAMPLE 10<br>
The following experiment was conducted to evaluate the effect of a malonate salt (such as DMAE malonate) to enhance the oxidative stability of cinnamaldehyde, a typical fragrance ingredient. Cinnamaldahyde (0.025 ml) was mixed with methanol (15.98 ml). This solution (3 ml) was aliquoted into a cuvette and placed in a UV spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer Lambda 35 instrument). The spectrophotometer was operated in the range 24 0-450 nm to obtain an absorption spectrum versus a methanol control solution (Spectrum A) . A second cinnamaldahyde (0.025 ml) charge was mixed with methanol (15.98 ml). Hydrogen peroxide (0.045 g) was added to this solution with mixing for 30 seconds.  Thereafter 3<br><br>
WO 2004/082652	PCT/EP2004/002558<br>
ml of the solution was aliquoted into a cuvette and placed in the UV spectrophotometer. The range of 240-4 50 nm of the spectrophotometer was scanned to obtain an absorption spectrum versus a methanol control solution (Spectrum B).<br>
A third solution was blended. This consisted of cinnamaldahyde (0.025 ml) and mixed with methanol (15 ml) and dimethylaminoethanol salt of malonic acid (DMAE malonate) (1 ml). Hydrogen peroxide (0.045 g) was added to this solution and allowed to mix for 30 seconds. A portion of the solution (3 ml) was aliquoted into a cuvette and placed for measurement in the UV spectrophotometer. Again the range 240-450 nm of the spectrophotometer was scanned to obtain an absorption spectrum versus a methanol control solution (Spectrum C).<br>
Spectrum A corresponding to cinnamaldahyde exhibited an absorption maximum around 287 nm. Spectrum B obtained upon adding hydrogen peroxide to cinnamaldahyde (to enhance oxidative decomposition), exhibited a significant increase in the intensity of the absorption maximum at 287 nm. Specifically, the ratio at 2B7 mn of the absorptions for Spectrum B to Spectrum A was 1.4. The increase in absorption intensity at this wavelength can be attributed to an increase in the species absorbing at that wavelength, due to oxidation induced by hydrogen peroxide.<br>
Spectrum C obtained upon addition of hydrogen peroxide to cinnamaldahyde in the presence of DMAE malonate showed a decrease in the intensity of the absorption maximum at 287 nm relative to Spectrum B. The absorption intensity ratio of Spectrum C to Spectrum B was 0.4. The result indicates a retardation of the hydrogen peroxide induced oxidation of cinnamaldahyde. Accordingly, it is evident that malonate salts do have a stability enhancing effect upon typical fragrance components.<br><br>
