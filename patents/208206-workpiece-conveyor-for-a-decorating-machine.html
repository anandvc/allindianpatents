(WORKPIECE CONVEYOR POR A DECORATING MACHINE) BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention: The present invention relates to<br>
an apparatus for        for applying decoration<br>
conveying  workpieces in a workpieco decorating machine and, more particularly, to imparting traveling motion to workpieces for delivery to and from a decorating station at which traveling motion is interrupted by a dwell period to allow the application of decoration to the workpiece.<br>
2.	Description ofthe Prior Art: As shown in U.S. Patent<br>
Nos. 2,23.1,535; 2,261,255; 2,721,516; 3,146,705; and 5,524,535<br>
intermittent motion type decorating machines are known in the art and<br>
provide an indexing drive system to impart intermittent traveling motion<br>
to an endless conveyor chain used to supply workpieces such as<br>
containers made of glass or plastic. A container is moved by the endless<br>
chain conveyor through a predetermined distance, stopped, moved again<br>
through a predetermined distance, stopped and again moved until each<br>
container through the sequence of motions moves completely through<br>
each of a predetermined number of decorating stations ofthe decorating<br>
machine. A decorating station will be provided at one or more places<br>
where the container comes to a stop. At each decorating station while<br>
the container is stopped from traveling motion, a decorating screen is<br>
displaced into line contact by an associated squeegee with the surface of<br>
the container while the container is rotated about a longitudinal axis<br>
2<br>
 thereof. During the decorating process a synchronous speed relation is<br>
maintained between the linear speed of the screen undergoing linear<br>
displacement and the speed of rotation of the container at the line of<br>
contact established by the squeegee. The squeegee remains stationary<br>
during the decorating process. Decorating machines of this type are<br>
particularly useful to decorate bottles and carryout the decoration while<br>
the surface of the bottle being decorated is horizontally orientated.<br>
In the aforesaid United States Patent 2,261,255 there is<br>
disclosed a drive for moving each of a screen to decorate a cylindrical<br>
body of a bottle and a shoulder screen to decorate a tapered neck<br>
portion of the bottle substantially at the same peripheral linear speed.<br>
The decorating machine disclosed in the aforesaid patent number<br>
3,251,298, provided a production rate of about 125 bottles per minute.<br>
More recently as disclosed in United States Patent No. 5,524,535 a<br>
decorating machine design is provided to increase the production rate of<br>
up to 150 bottles per minute. In this decorating machine, the machine<br>
cycle is altered to attain the increased production rate. The altered<br>
machine cycle provides that the portion of the cycle for conveyor<br>
indexing has a reduced duration in order to provide an increased part of<br>
the machine cycle for decorating. The reduced cycle for indexing places<br>
increased demands for indexing power requirements and number of<br>
chains and sprockets to reduce unwanted chain stress. At such<br>
3 <br>
production rates, the start and stop events of the intermittent<br>
advancement of the endless conveyor impose severe stress and strain on<br>
the entire conveyor system including the drive therefore. Typically such<br>
a conveyor includes spaced apart horizontal shafts one of which is<br>
driven by an indexer drive and the other is an idler shaft. Each shaft<br>
supports at least two and sometimes three or more spaced apart<br>
sprockets. Wear of the sprocket teeth can be reduced by increasing the<br>
number of sprockets and associated chains thereby reducing the loading<br>
on each sprocket; however, by increasing the number of sprockets and<br>
chains, the power requirements for the indexer drive increase since the<br>
mass represented by the conveyor that must be indexed is increased. A<br>
sprocket on the driven shaft and the sprocket on the idler shaft engage<br>
with an endless chain made up of links connected with carriers for<br>
workpieces. The idler sprocket is rotatably supported by bearings and<br>
acted upon by a spring loaded tensioner to impose a predetermined<br>
tension on the endless chains engaged with the respective sprockets.<br>
In such intermittent motion decorating machines,<br>
thermosetting ink was usually the printing medium particularly when<br>
multiple color decoration was desired. Ink of only one color is applied<br>
at each decorating station and to decorate with multiple colors requires<br>
corresponding multiple decoration stations. When the different colors<br>
interleave in a given area of the bottle, the same area is contacted with<br>
4<br>
 the screens for each color and therefore it is necessary that the applied<br>
ink/color is a solid and vail not smear when additional ink/color is<br>
applied.   Although the ink is solidified after each printing operation, it<br>
was necessary to cure the ink by feeding the bottles through a furnace<br>
after discharging from the decorating machine. In co-pending patent<br>
application Serial No. 09/079,753 filed May 15, 1998 there is disclosed<br>
a decorating method and apparatus to allow curing of ink decoration<br>
applied at one station before additional decoration is applied so that the<br>
decoration on a bottle delivered from the decoration machine is cured<br>
and the bottle can be loaded directly into a shipping container without<br>
the need for curing the ink decoration. The decorating medium is<br>
chosen to cure very rapidly when exposed to a source of an<br>
electromagnetic wave such as ultraviolet radiation or heat. Curing<br>
stations are interleaved between printing stations and provided with<br>
drives to rotate the bottle at the curing station for exposing uncured<br>
printing medium to the electromagnetic wave or heat to curing the<br>
printing medium. The dwell period of the intermittent advancing motion<br>
by the conveyor chain is used to apply decoration and to cure the applied<br>
decoration all at difference spaced apart sites along the course of travel<br>
by the bottles in the decorating machine.<br>
The present invention seeks to provide a traveling motion<br>
for workpieces interrupted only at a work station which can be the<br>
5<br>
 printing station and when desired a curing station in an intermittent<br>
motion type decorating machine in a manner representing a complete<br>
departure from the com'entional practice of using a chain conveyor to '<br>
support workpieces while intermittently advanced by operation of an<br>
indexer drive. The conveyance of workpieces particularly bottles, for<br>
example, in intermittent type decorating machines provides that each<br>
bottle must dwell at a decorating station for a period of time sufficient to<br>
apply the desired decoration. At the decorating station, silk screen<br>
printing technique is used for the application of the decoration to a<br>
workpiece. This printing technique requires a precise relationship<br>
formed by moving the squeegee to establish line contact between a<br>
linear moving screen and the rotating surface of the bottle. The line<br>
contact established by the squeegee must be in a horizontal plane which<br>
is a tangent to the decorating site. The repetitious starting and stopping<br>
of the conveyor causes elongation of the metal links due to wear in<br>
response to the stress and strain of the conveyor operation. Conveyor<br>
stretch adversely affects the relationship between a bottle at a decorating<br>
station and the operating position of the squeegee as well as registration<br>
of the silk screen relative to the bottle at the decorating station. The<br>
conveyor stretch also degrades the accuracy of seam alignment at the<br>
indexing operation used to orientate a bottle immediately after loading<br>
onto the conveyor chain. A lack of registration of the decoration and the<br>
6 <br>
likelihood of smearing of the printing will occur in the event the<br>
intermittent motion of the chain conveyor brings a bottle to rest slightly<br>
before or slightly after the preselected site for the decorating operation.<br>
Also, a misalignment between the longitudinal axis about which the<br>
bottle is rotated and a rotational axis about the bottle rotator drive causes<br>
a mismatch to the required s)'nchronous speed relation between<br>
decorating screen and bottle.<br>
Stretch of the conveyor chain can be compensated by<br>
adjustments to the position of the squeegee and screen along the course<br>
of travel by the conveyor chain. Eventually the connections between<br>
chain links, where resulting in excessive clearance with also contributes<br>
to an elongation of the conveyor chain. The arrangement of parallel<br>
conveyor chains must transmit the torque necessary to achieve the rapid<br>
intermittent motion to control movement of not only the mass of the<br>
chains and idler sprocket but also the bottle carriers and bottles<br>
supported by the carriers. Required operating clearances and the<br>
manufacturing tolerance betv/een pivotal surfaces of parts forming chain<br>
links typically produce a variation to the chain pitch of 1/1000 of an inch<br>
between chain links. If there are, for example, 62 chain links forming<br>
each endless chain, the manufacturing tolerance presents a total of<br>
62/1000 of chain links variation which adversely effects the need for an<br>
exact positioning of each bottle carrier at a decorating station. The<br>
7<br>
condition clearly becomes worse as the number of links in each continuous chain increases. The mass of the conveyor increases when the size of the link increase which imposes an adverse effect to the drive requirements for the indexing drive. These tolerances present unwanted variations to the separating distance between carriers. The rapid starting and stopping of the carrier laden chains generate noise, the level of which increases with the indexing rate per minute. Stretch of the chain links occur continuously with the operation of the conveyor and when the quality of registration degrades or at scheduled maintenance intervals, compensating adjustments must be carried out usually at intervals of several months. It has been found that typically chain link stretch and wear between pivotal parts of the chain links degrade the operation of the conveyor beyond acceptable limits and requiring replacement of the chains on an annual basis given normal hours of operation of the decorator.<br>
Workpiece regiistration at the printing stations is established by adjusting each printing station relative to the location of a workpiece during a dwell period. Not only must the printing stations be adjusted relative to the decorating position of the workpiece but also the indexing registration station and the bottle loading equipment require similar position correcting adjustments. Chain stretch and the dimensional tolerances between links are factors which limited the<br>
8<br>
 length of a conveyor that can be provided in a decorating machine. At<br>
each decorating station there is a rotator drive head provided with a<br>
slotted opening to receive a roller on the end of a crank arm by which a<br>
bottle is rotated for the decorating process. The rotational axis of the<br>
bottle and the rotational axis of the drive head must be aligned to<br>
produce a uniform rotational speed of the bottle surface to which<br>
decoration is applied. Chain stretch causes a misalignment resulting in a<br>
nonconcentric rotation between the rotational axis of the bottle and the<br>
rotator. As a result, the applied decoration is distorted because of<br>
slippage due to the mismatch of speeds between the screens and the<br>
bottle surface.<br>
The present invention eliminates the requirement to<br>
rapidly accelerate and decelerate a carrier laden chain conveyor<br>
containing all bottles or workpieces processed in a decorating machine<br>
by providing that only those workpiece laden carriers discharged from a<br>
decorating station and entering an empty decorating station is<br>
accelerated to a continuous advancing movement. All remaining<br>
carriers are advanced by a continuous motion which according to the<br>
preferred embodiment, the continuous motion is at a constant speed.<br>
The torque requirement to convey workpieces is greatly reduced by this<br>
arrangement and the speed at which workpiece laden carriers are<br>
advanced from decorating station and to decorating station as well as<br>
9 <br>
executing return travel from the exit to the entry end of the decorating<br>
machine can be increased significantly to speeds that are not believed<br>
obtainable in a conventional chain conveyor system.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a workpiece conveying system wherein only a workpiece discharged from the decorating station and a workpiece entering a decorating station are accelerated from a rate of travel at a continuous speed and wherein workpiece carriers are returned from a discharge end of a decorating machine to the entry end of a decorating machine at a rate of travel which is of a continuous speed.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a workpiece conveying system wherein only a workpiece discharged from a dwell station and a workpiece entering an empty dwell station are accelerated from a rate of travel at a continuous speed, the dwell station being plural in number and include a decorating station and a curing station for printing medium applied at a decorating station and wherein workpiece carriers are returned from a discharge end of a decorating machine to the entry end of a decorating machine at a rate of travel which is of a continuous speed.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a workpiece conveying system supplying a dwell period wherein workpieces are not subject to conveying motion while decorated at<br>
10 <br>
decorating stations and at all other times the workpieces are advanced by a continuous motion.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to continuously convey workpieces to and from decorating stations on carriers that are independent and discrete from one another.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a workpiece conveying system having conveying cam tracks in barrel cams to impart traveling motion to carriers with and without workpiece   ' in an endless fashion for an intermittent motion type decorating machine.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a tandem arrangement of barrel cams driven to rotate about a common longitudinal axis for advancing a plurality of separate and independent workpiece carriers along continuous cam tracks of the barrel cams and a carrier transfer disk between the tandem arrangement of cams for delivering a workpiece carrier from a cam track in one of the tandemly arranged barrel cams to the cjim track of the other tandemly arranged bzirrel cams and thereby proviide a conveyor system for an intermittent type decorating machine of an unusually great length and an unusually low torque requirement for a multiplicity of decoration operations without the need to provide more than one decorating machine.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Referring now to Figures 1 and 2 of the drawings, there is illustrated a decorating machine 10 in the preferred form includes a base 11 for supporting a workpiece conveyor 12 embodying a construction according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention to convey workpieces which, for the purpose of describing the preferred embodiment of the present invention, consist of bottles. The conveyor receives bottles from bottle loading equipment, not shovm, and advances the bottles to a registration station 13 and thence to three successively arranged decorating stations PI, P2 and P3. The bottles are advanced from the last decorating station P3 to bottle unloading equipment, not shown.<br>
The drive arrangement for the decorating machine includes, as shown in Figures 3 - 6, a main drive motor 15 having a drive output shaft connected by a belt 16 to a first line shaft 17 rotatably supported by spaced apart pillow blocks 17A. Spaced along line shaft 17 are four pulleys 18, 19,20 and21 provided with belts 22, 23, 24 and 25, respectively. The belts 22, 23 and 25 extend to gear drives 26, 27 and 29, respectively. The geiir drives 26, 27 and 29 have output shafts<br><br>
17 <br>
secured to rotate cams 30, 31 and 32 (Figures 1, 3 and 4). The cams 30-<br>
32 are formed with closed cam tracks 30A, 31A and 32A also known as<br>
a face groove or positive can:i. Bottles are decorated at each decorating<br>
station in an identical fashion by initiating screen travel when a bottle<br>
arrives at the decorating station. Figure 4 illustrates the cam tracks 30A,<br>
31A and 32A of the respective cams are each constructed to form two<br>
bottle decorating cycles sepairated by a screen dwell cycle. More<br>
specifically, cam track 30A consists of a screen dwell cycle 30B, bottle<br>
decorating cycle 30C, screen dwell cycle 30B' and a bottle decorating<br>
cycle 30C'. Cam track 31A consists of a screen dwell cycle 31B, bottle<br>
decorating cycle 31C, screen dwell cycle 3IB' and a bottle decorating<br>
cycle 31C'. Cam track 32A consists of a<br>
screen dwell cycle 32B, bottle decorating cycle 32C, screen dwell cycle<br>
32B' and a bottle decorating cycle 32C'. In the first bottle decorating<br>
cycle, the decorating screens at each decorating station PI, P2 and P3<br>
are linearly displaced in one direction during which one bottle is<br>
decorated at each decorating station. After these bottles are decorated,<br>
the screens remain stationary during screen dwell cycles and then the<br>
screens are reciprocated in the opposite direction during which<br>
succeeding bottles are decorated at each decorating station. The cam<br>
tracks 30A, 31A and 32A define the precise occurrence of events with<br>
respect to the movement of the bottles by the workpiece conveyor since<br><br>
18<br>
 the cams 30-32 and the workipiece conveyor are drivenly interconnected<br>
in the same drive train and driven by the same main drive motor 15.<br>
Each cam has a follower in the respective cam track to pivot an<br>
oscillating drive output at each of the decorating stations as will be<br>
discussed in greater detail hereinafter. The belt 24 driven by the first<br>
line shaft 17 extends to a pulley 20A mounted on a rotatably supported<br>
shaft having a gear 28 meshing with a gear 33. Gears 28 and 33 form a<br>
speed reduction relationship. Gear 33 is mounted on an intermediate<br>
shaft 34 supported by pillow blocks and having a pulley 35 provided<br>
with a belt 36 extending to a pulley 37 mounted on a second line shaft<br>
38.<br>
As shown in Figures 5 and 6, line shaft 38 is rotatably<br>
supported by two spaced apart arms 40 extending from the base 11 in a<br>
cantilever fashion and secured by bolts to the base of the decorating<br>
machine. The outer most ends of the arms 40 are connected to an<br>
elongated cover plate 41. Secured to each of the arms 40 are spaced<br>
apart spacers 42 that extend horizontally and outwardly in opposite<br>
directions from the arms 40. The outer ends of the spacers 42 carry<br>
vertically extending mounting plates 43 from which various drive gears<br>
project only at the unloaded end of the conveyor. The second line shaft<br>
38 is rotatably supported by bearings 44 mounted on portions of the<br>
arms 40 adjacent the base 11 and latterly outwardly of each of the<br><br>
19 <br>
bearings 44 there is also a bearing assembly 45 mounted by a carrier<br>
bracket 46 to the base 11. The bearing assembUes 45 rotatably support<br>
the outer end portions of the second line shaft 38. Outwardly of each<br>
bearing assembly 45 there is a worm gear 47 mounted on each of the<br>
terminal end portions of the second line shaft 38. A worm gear 47 at the<br>
loading end of the decorating machine meshes with a gear wheel 48 and<br>
the worm gear at the unloading end of the decorating machine meshes<br>
with a gear wheel 49. The gear wheels 48 and 49 are mounted on drive<br>
shafts 50 and 51, respectively.<br>
Spaced apart carrier supply disks 52 and 53 are mounted<br>
on the inboard and outboard ends, respectively, of drive shaft 50 and<br>
spaced apart carrier return disks 54 and 55 are mounted on the inboard<br>
and outboard ends, respectively, of drive shaft 51. A pulley 56 is<br>
mounted on the second line shaft 38 and joined by a drive belt 57 to a<br>
pulley 58 mounted on a drive shaft 59 extending horizontally above the<br>
drive shaft 51. Tension in the drive belt 57 is controllably set by using<br>
fasteners to secure a roller support arm 57A rotatably supporting a slack<br>
adjusting roller 57B in a fixed position to arm 40 for establishing the<br>
position for roller 57B to impose a desired tension on belt 57.   As<br>
shown in Figure 6, a drive pinion gear 60 is mounted on the horizontally<br>
extended end of drive shaft 59 and meshes with idler gears 61 and 62<br>
which in turn mesh with idler gears 63 and 64, respectively. Idler gear<br><br>
20<br>
.61 meshes with a drive gear 65 mounted on a support shaft of a barrel cam 66; idler gear 62 meshes with a drive gear 67 mounted on a support shaft of a barrel cam 68; idler gear 63 meshes with a drive gear 69 mounted on a support shaft of a barrel cam 70; and idler gear 64 meshes with a drive gear 71 mounted on a support shaft of a barrel cam 72. As shown in Figures 4, 6 and 7, the barrel cam 66, 68, 70 and 72 are rotatably supported by bearings 73 carried on the support shafts at opposite ends of the barrel cams. The bearings 73 are mounted in suitable apertures formed in the vertically extending mounting plates 43 such that the barrel cams can rotate about a horizontal axes with the axes of barrel cams 66 and 68 lying in a common horizontal plane and there below the axes of rotation of barrel cams 70 and 72 lie in a common horizontal plane. Each of the barrel cams 66, 68, 70 and 72 have closed cam track 66A, 68A, 70A and 72A which is a continuous groove milled in the cam body engaged by a roller attached to a follower for executing movements by workpiece carriers as will be described in greater detail hereinafter to provide continuous traveling motion until interrupted by a dwell period "D" provided for the printing operation.<br>
As in Figures 2, 6, 8 and 12A-12C, the closed cam tracks 66A, 68A, 70A and 72A receive spaced apart roller parts of cam followers 74 and 75 mounted on each of a plurality of discrete and independently moveable bottle carriers 76. The details of the<br><br>
21 <br>
construction of the bottle carriers is best shown in Figures 12A-12C. Each bottle carrier is provided with a base cup 77 having a shallow support surface 77A surrounded by a protruding beveled edge to receive and center the base section of the bottle. A mouthpiece 78 has a shallow support surface 78A surrounded by a protruding beveled edge to receive and center the mouth of a bottle. Mouthpiece 78 is rotatably supported by neck chuck 79 having diverging support legs 79A and 79B. Leg 79A is selectively positionable along an actuator shaft 80 having teeth 81 for engaging a releasable latch to allow clamped positioning of the mouthpiece 78 relative to the base cup 77 at any of diverse sites to accommodate a particular height of a bottle between the base cup and mouthpiece. The actuator shaft 80 is slidably supported by spaced apart linear bearings 82 and 83 mounted on an elongated carrier plate 84. An actuator cam follower 80A is rotatably supported by an end portion of shaft 80 which protrudes from the bearing adjacent the base cup 77 for contact with cam surfaces 85 and 86 of actuator cams (Figure 2) mounted on the base of the decorating machine at the entry and deliver ends thereof respectively. The cam surface 85 increases the distance separating the base cup 77 and the neck chuck 79 to allow loading of a bottle between the cup and chuck and similarly at the bottle unloading site the cam surface 86 again increases the distance separating the base cup and the neck chuck to allow removal of the bottle from the carrier.<br><br>
22<br>
 The neck chuck 79 is provided with a linear bearing 87 resiliently<br>
supported by a support shaft 88 in the same manner as disclosed in<br>
United States Patent No. 3,338,574 whose disclosure is incorporated<br>
herein by this reference thereto.<br>
As shown in Figures 5, 8, and 12A-12C extending from<br>
the base cup 77 is a journal 89 which is rotatably supported by a bearing<br>
in an upstanding housing 90. An end part of the journal 89 is bolted to a<br>
crank arm 91 extending perpendicular to the rotational axis of journal<br>
89. The free end of arm 91 supports a drive roller 92 for rotating the<br>
base cup at the registration station, not shown, and a bottle at each of the<br>
decorating stations PI, P2 and P3. As shown in Figures 8-10 and 12A-<br>
12C, laterally outwardly from the cam followers 74 and 75 there are<br>
mounting blocks 94A and 94 B secured to the bottom surface of the<br>
carrier plate 84. The mounting blocks 94A and 94B support rotatable<br>
follower rollers 95A and 95B, respectively, which pass into engagement<br>
with horizontally aligned cavities 52A and 53A distributed about the<br>
outer peripheral edges of the supply disks 52 and 53 when cam followers<br>
74 and 75 exit cam tracks 70A and 72A of the barrel cams 70 and 72.<br>
Similarly, the follower rollers 95A and 95B, respectively, which pass<br>
into engagement with horizontally aligned cavities 54A and 55A<br>
distributed about the outer peripheral edges of carrier return disks 54 and<br><br>
23 <br>
55 when cam followers exit cam tracks 66A and 68A of the barrel cams<br>
66 and 68 (Figures 6 and 8).<br>
The bottle carriers are each sequentially transferred from an established positive driving relation with barrel cams 66 and 68 into a positive driving relation with carrier disks 54 and 55 and transferred from carrier disks 54 and 55 into a positive driving relation with barrel cams 70 and 72 and thence from barrel cams 70 and 72 to a positive driving relation with carrier disks 52 and 53 and complete a conveyance cycle transfer from carrier disks 52 and 53 into a positive driving relation with barrel cams 66 and 68. The cams to disks transfer is always the same and the transfer from disks to cams is always the same. The sequence of events for the transfer from disks to cams is the reversal of the sequence of events for the transfer from cams to disks. The bottle carrier transfer for one end of the bottle carrier is schematically shown in Figures 1 lA-1 ID for the disk 53 to barrel cam 68 via cam followers 95B and 75, it is to be understood that the same relationship between disks 52, cam 66 and cam followers 74 and 95A at the end of the bottle carrier adjacent to the decorating machine.<br>
In Figure 1 lA, the cam follower 95B is seated in cavity 53 A of disk 53 and cam follower 75 resides at the entrance of cam track 68A in barrel cam 68. As shown in Figure 1 IB, as disk 53 rotates clockwise, follower 95B is carried in cavity 53A to a 12 o'clock position<br><br>
24 <br>
of disk 53 and the barrel cam 75 rotates in the direction indicated by an<br>
associated arrow bringing the cam track 68A into a position so that the<br>
site for entrance to cam track 68A is positioned for entry of follower 75.<br>
As shown in Figure 11C, continued rotation of the disk 53 and barrel<br>
cam 68 drives the cam follov/er 75 into and along cam track 68 A of the<br>
cam 68 by continued advancing movement of follower 95B in cavity<br>
53 A while at the same time the cavity 53 A of disk 53 recedes from the<br>
cam follower 95B. The bottle carrier transfer is completed, as shown in<br>
Figure 1 ID, when the disk wall defining cavity 53A of disk 53 passes<br>
out of contact with cam follower 95B and at the same time cam follower<br>
75 advances along cam track 68A of barrel cam 68 as shown.<br>
As shown in Figures 9, 10, 12B and 12C, a cluster of three<br>
spaced apart inboard guide rollers 96A, 96B and 96C are rotatably<br>
supported by the carrier plate: 84 at its end most closely adjacent the<br>
decorating machine and a cluster of three spaced apart outer guide<br>
rollers 97A, 97B and 97C are rotatably supported by the carrier plate 84<br>
at its end remote to the decorating machine. As best shown in Figures 9<br>
and 10, secured to arms 40 extending from the decorating machine is an<br>
endless track plate 98 having a cavity wherein inboard guide rollers 96A<br>
and 96C engage opposed horizontal track surfaces 98A and 98B of the<br>
cavity. Guide roller 96B engages a vertical face surface 98C of the<br>
guide track. Secured to each of the arms 40 and plate 41 is an endless<br><br>
25 <br>
track plate 99 having a cavity wherein outer guide rollers 97A and 97C<br>
engage opposed horizontal track surfaces 99A and 99B of the cavity.<br>
Guide roller 97B engages a vertical face surface 99C of the guide track.<br>
The guidance provided by the cooperation between the guide rollers<br>
96A, 96C, 97A and 97C which rotate about horizontal axes and the<br>
horizontal guide surfaces 98A, 98B, 99A and 99B provide load bearing<br>
support for the carrier; maintain cam followers 74 and 75 engaged with<br>
the cam tracks of cam 66, 68, 70 and 72 and maintain the carrier in a<br>
stable orientation during movement along the cam track.   Guide rollers<br>
96B and 97B which rotate about vertical axes prevent unwanted<br>
displacement of the carrier between the guide tracks 98 and 99 in a<br>
longitudinal axis of a bottle when supported by the carrier.<br>
At each decorating station PI, P2 and P3 the arrangement<br>
of apparatus is identical. As shown in Figures 3, 4 and 8, it can be seen<br>
that the gear drive 29 has its output drive shaft connected to rotate the<br>
cam 32. A cam track 32A is machined into the cam 32 and received in<br>
the cam track is a cam follower 32D. The cam follower is mounted to a<br>
lever arm 100 which is in turn secured to the lower end of a vertical<br>
shaft 101. The shaft 101 is supported by spaced apart bearings, as<br>
shown in Figure 8, which are in turn carried by a tubular column 102<br>
supported by the base of the decorator machine 10. At the top of the<br>
column 102 there are superimposed oscillation arm assemblies 103 and<br><br>
26 <br>
104. Assembly 103 is made up of a lever arm 105 secured to shaft 101<br>
and provided with a guideway 106 extending radially of the shaft. In the<br>
guideway there is arranged a drive bar 107 which can be moved along<br>
the guideway by the threaded portion of a hand wheel 108. The distance<br>
the drive bar 107 is located radially of the rotational axis of shaft 101 is<br>
controlled by the hand wheel 108. A drive block 109 is mounted on a<br>
portion of the drive bar 107 projecting vertically above the guideway<br>
and reciprocates in an inverted "U" shaped slot formed in a drive bar<br>
110. The drive bar is joined to a slide 111 supported in a guideway 112.<br>
The slide is held in a slot of guideway 112 by gib plates 113. While not<br>
shown, the slide 111 protrudes laterally fi*om opposite sides of the<br>
tubular column 102 and is provided with outwardly spaced apart receiver<br>
arms 114 and 115. The receiver arm 114 engages a decorating screen<br>
assembly 116 that is reciprocated by the linear motion of the slide 111 to<br>
thereby reciprocate the decorating screen assembly along the body<br>
portion Bl of a bottle for canying out decorating operations thereon.<br>
Assembly 104 includes a lever arm 119 secured to shaft 101 and<br>
provided with a guideway 120 extending radially of the shaft. In the<br>
guideway there is arranged a drive bar 121 which can be moved along<br>
the guideway by the threaded portion of a feed screw operated by a hand<br>
wheel 122. The distance the drive bar 121 is located radially of the<br>
rotational axis of shaft 101 is controlled by the hand wheel 122. A drive<br><br>
27 <br>
block 123 is mounted on a portion of the drive bar 121 projecting<br>
vertically downwardly from the guideway and reciprocates in a "U"<br>
shaped slot formed in a drive bar 124. The drive bar is joined to a slide<br>
125 supported in a guideway 112. The slide 125 is held in a slot of<br>
guideway 112 by gib plates 126. The slide 125 protrudes laterally from<br>
opposite sides of the tubular column 102, in the same manner as slide<br>
111 protrudes. Similarly, the receiver arm 115 engages a decorating<br>
screen assembly 118 that is reciprocated by the linear motion of the slide<br>
125 to thereby reciprocate the decorating screen assembly along the neck<br>
portion Nl of a bottle for canying out decorating operations thereon.<br>
Hand wheels 108 and 122 are used to select a desired<br>
stroke for the screen reciprocation to match the circumferential distance<br>
of the bottle which is to be decorated. This matching relationship is<br>
critically significant because no relative motion between the screen<br>
movement and the bottle rotation can be accepted otherwise, smearing or<br>
poor quality decorating will occur. As shown in Figure 8, squeegees<br>
129 and 130 are carried by a support arm 131 in positions above the<br>
screens 116 and 118, respectively. The squeegee construction is per se<br>
is known in the art and is shown in United States Patent No. 3,172,357.<br>
Each squeegee includes a squeegee rubber 132 on the end portion of a<br>
squeegee positioning cylinder, operated pneumatically against the force<br>
of a return spring thereby to establish line contact between the screen<br><br>
28 <br>
assembly 116 and 118 and a bottle as the bottle is rotated in a<br>
synchronous speed with linear movement of the screens. The squeegees<br>
are adjustably located by fasteners engaged in a mounting slot 133<br>
extending along the elongated length of the support arm 131.<br>
At each decorating station there is provided as part of the<br>
screen drives, a drive to rotate a rotator assembly 136. As shown in<br>
Figure 8, the rotator assembly includes a drive gear 143 which is located<br>
beneath lower arm 105 where the teeth of gear 143 mesh with teeth of an<br>
elongated rack 137. Rack 137 is secured to a slide 138 arranged in a<br>
slideway supported by a pedestal 142. The slide 138 is constrained in a<br>
slideway by gibs 139 to reciprocate in response to a driving force<br>
imparted to a "U" shaped drive bar 140. The driving force is imparted<br>
by a drive block 141 mounted in a slot formed in the underside of lower<br>
arm 105. Drive block 141 serves to convert oscillating motion of lower<br>
arm 105 to linear motion of the slide thereby reciprocating the rack 137.<br>
The teeth of the rack 137 mesh with gear teeth of a drive gear 143<br>
mounted on an end portion of an arbor 144 which is rotatably supported<br>
by a bearing 145 mounted in a bearing housing secured to a face plate<br>
146 mounted on the base 11.   A rotator drive head 147 is secured to the<br>
end portion of the arbor 144 and formed with a slotted opening 148<br>
extending transversely to thie longitudinal axis about which the arbor 144<br>
rotates. The slotted opening receives the drive roller 92 on a bottle<br><br>
29 <br>
carrier 76 as the carrier approaches a dwell position "D" in the course of travel along the decorating machine. When the drive roller 92 is received in the opening 148, a driving relationship is established whereby rotation of the rotator head 147 rotates the drive roller 92 and the crank arm 91 for rotating the bottle 360° at the bottle decorating station.<br>
As shown in Figure 10, at each decorating station where a workpiece carrier is brought to a dwell period "D" interrupting its course of traveling motion there is an elongated riser section 150 representing an elevation increase to guide surfaces 98A and 98B of the guide 98. At the outboard side of the workpiece conveyor there is at each decorating station an elongated riser section, not shown, horizontally aligned with an identical elongated riser section 150 of guide 98 and representing an elevation increase to guide surfaces 99A and 99B of the guide 99 whereby each workpiece carrier arriving at a decorating station is acted upon simultaneously by a riser section at each of the opposite ends of the workpiece carrier. The riser sections elevate the bottle carrier and thus the bottle supported thereby a short distance so that the decorating screens can freely reciprocate in either direction without impingement contact with adjacent bottles.<br>
In Figures 2, 5, 7, 8, 12A and 12B, the bottles are supplied to the decorating machine by a conveyor, not shown, and introduced<br><br>
30<br>
horizontally at a loading station 151 where each bottle is engaged between base cup 77 and neck chuck 79 of an associated one of the bottle carriers 76 and advanced by the driving relation between followers 95A and 95B interfittihg and drivenly engaged in aligned cavities 52A and 53 A, respectively, of supply disks 52 and 53 to the registration station 13. The bottle is rotated about its longitudinal axis by a rotator head constructed in the same manner as rotator 147 and rotated by a suitable drive while a registration finger extends into the path of travel of a registration cavity formed in the lower base portion of the bottle. When the registration finger passes into the registration cavity of the bottle, rotation of the bottle is stopped there is established a predetermined bottle orientation with respect to the decorating screens.<br>
The predetermined bottle orientation establishes a predetermined registration of the workpiece with respect to the decorating screens at each of the spaced apart decorating stations. The registration process is particularly useful to orient seam lines extending along opposite sides of a bottle with respect to the location of the desired area for decoration. As shown in Figures 7 and 8, registration of the bottle is concluded with the orientation of the crank arm 91 such that the drive roller 92 trails the advancing movement of the bottle carrier to the decorating stations. As the drive roller 92 emerges fi-om a slot in the<br><br>
31<br>
 rotator drive at the indexing sitation, the drive roller 92 is captured and<br>
guided by spaced apart guide rails 152 and 153. These guide rails<br>
extend along an endless path of travel by the drive roller 92 throughout<br>
the endless circulating movement of the workpiece carriers to thereby<br>
control the orientation of the crank arm and maintain registration of the<br>
bottle at each decorating station. At each of the decorating stations PI,<br>
P2 and P3 the continuity of tlie guide rails 152 and 153 are interrupted<br>
by a gap wherein a drive rotator 147 member is located to receive and<br>
rotate a bottle. Downstream of each gap in the guide rails 152 and 153<br>
are outwardly protruding collector rail portions 152A and 153A that<br>
return the roller and crank arm to the gap between guide rails as the<br>
barrel cams 66 and 68 operate advancing the bottles after completion of<br>
the decorating to an unloading station 154.<br>
As can be seen from Figures 13A-13E, the motion<br>
imparted to each of the discrete bottle carriers according to the preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention is made up of three components<br>
namely; a continuous traveling motion "C"; accelerated traveling motion<br>
"A"; and dwell period "D" which are identified in relation to the<br>
schematic illustration of cam tracks in segments of barrel cams 66 and<br>
68 upstream and downstream of a decorating station identified as P2. In<br>
each of the Figures 13A-13E five bottles, 1-5 are shown, in their relative<br>
spaced relation during advancement to and from a dwell period "D" at a<br><br>
32 <br>
decorating station. As described and shown previously, a cam follower<br>
74 engages in a closed cam track 66A and cam follower 75 engages in<br>
closed cam track 68A. In Figure 13A, a vertical line extends between a<br>
cam follower 74 and a cam follower 75 to bottle 1 and intended<br>
schematically to represent that bottle 1 is carried by a bottle carrier<br>
while advanced by barrel cams. Similar relations are illustrated in<br>
regard to bottles 2, 3, 4 and 5. It is assumed for disclosure purposes that<br>
bottle 3 resides at the commencement of a dwell period "D" at the<br>
decorating station and the cam follower of the decorating machine<br>
resides at the commencement of the bottle decorating cycle 31C defined<br>
by the cam track 31A (Figure 4). As the barrel cams 66 and 68 rotate in<br>
the direction indicated by arrows, bottle 3 remains stationary with<br>
respect to motion at the decoration station. Bottle 2 is at a site of exiting<br>
an accelerated travel motion "'A" and entering cam track segment<br>
providing continuous traveling motion "C". The cam followers for<br>
bottles 1, 4 and 5 reside in cam track segments providing continuous<br>
traveling motion. In Figure 13 A bottles 2 and 3 are more closely spaced<br>
than the relative spacing between the remaining bottles. The bottles<br>
maintain an equally spaced apart relation as shown in Figure 13B where<br>
bottle 3 has resided about one-half through the dwell period and bottles<br>
1, 2,4 and 5 are advanced by motion imparted by the cam part segments<br>
of cams 66 and 68 providing the continuous travel "C" and the cam<br>
follower of the decorating machine resides midway along the bottle<br>
decorating cycle 31C defined by cam track 31A of cam 31. At the end<br><br>
33 <br>
of the dwell period for bottle 3 the cam follower of the decorating<br>
machine resides at the conclusion of the bottle decorating cycle 31C<br>
defined by the cam track 31A and as shown in Figure 13C, bottles 1, 2,4<br>
and 5 continue in the cam segment providing continuous travel "C"<br>
whereby bottles 1 and 2 have moved away from bottle 3 and bottles 4<br>
and 5 have moved toward bottle 3. The cam followers for the carrier of<br>
bottle 3 are at the entrance of cam track providing accelerated travel "A"<br>
and the cam followers for the carrier for bottle 4 are at but not in the<br>
segment of the cam track providing accelerated motion "A".<br>
The cam follower of the decorating machine proceeds into the screen dwell cycle 3 IB defined by cam track 31A and remains in the screen dwell cycle until the airival of a bottle at the dwell period "D" of the cams 66 and 68. As shown in Figure 12D after bottle 3 has progressed in the accelerated travel motion "A", departing from the dwell period the cam followers for the carrier bottle 4 enter the accelerated travel motion "A" to rapidly introduce bottle 4 to the dwell period at the decorating station. In these relative motions, the distance between bottles 4 and 5 increases and the distance between bottles 3 and 4 decreases as depicted in Figure 13E where bottle 4 arrives at the dwell period "D"at decorating station and bottle 3 emerges fi-om the segment of the cam track providing acceleration and enters the segment of the cam track providing continuous traveling motion "C".<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the continuous traveling motion is provided by cam track segments designed<br><br>
34 <br>
to advance the bottles at a constant speed. The only cyclic loading of the<br>
drive system occurs during the acceleration period when a bottle is in<br>
transition from a continuous traveling motion to a dwell period and from<br>
the dwell period through an accelerated traveling motion to continuous<br>
traveling motion. The bottle carriers advance with a continuous<br>
traveling motion by the supply disks 52 and 53; carrier return disks 54<br>
and 55; and barrel cams 70 and 72. Thus, a significant improvement is<br>
provided by the present invention by eliminating a massive drive system<br>
to repetitively advance a chain conveyor through intermittent motions.<br>
Stress and strain on the drive; components are greatly reduced to that of<br>
overcoming friction of continuous moving carriers and the short periods<br>
of accelerated travel movement proximate the dwell period at a<br>
decorating station. The downtime needed in the past to align decorating<br>
equipment to a dwell position of a carrier on a chain conveyor for chain<br>
strgtch is eliminated. Thus, the present invention enables printing of a<br>
multiplicity of colors greatly exceeding the limit printing capabilities<br>
using a chain conveyor.<br>
The arrangement of parts for imparting the traveling<br>
motion to workpieces delivered to and from decorating stations provides<br>
an option to greatly increase the distance workpieces travel along the<br>
decorating machine without: the need to reduce the bottle through put<br>
rate because the mass of a chain conveyor system and workpieces<br>
supported thereby are not repetitiously indexed through a predetermined<br>
distance by starting and stopping each time a workpiece is indexed the<br><br>
35 <br>
predetermined distance. As shown in Figures 14 and 15, a decorating<br>
machine 210 includes a base 211 for supporting a workpiece conveyor<br>
212 which receives bottles from bottle loading equipment, not shown,<br>
and advances the bottles to a registration station 213 and thence to six<br>
spaced apart decorating stations PI, P2, P3, P4, P5 and P6. The bottles<br>
are advanced from the last decorating station P6 to bottle unloading<br>
equipment, not shown.<br>
The drive arrangement for the decorating machine 210 is<br>
expanded from the drive for the decorating machine 10 as shown in<br>
Figures 3 - 6 and described hereinbefore by providing that the line shaft<br>
17 driven by motor 15 is elongated sufficiently to provide additional<br>
length to mount the necessary six pulleys to drive six gear drives, one for<br>
each of the six decorating stations P1-P6. Illustrated in Figure 15 is a<br>
line shaft 238 on which there is mounted a pulley 237 which is driven by<br>
a belt extending to a pulley on a drive gear in the same manner as belt 36<br>
was provided to drive pulley 37 illustrated and described hereinbefore.<br>
The line shaft 238 is rotatably supported by three spaced apart arms<br>
240A, 240B and 240C which extend from the base 211 in a cantilever<br>
fashion and secured by bolts to the base of the decorating machine. The<br>
outer most ends of arms 240A, 240B and 240C are connected to an<br>
elongated cover plate 241. As shown in Figure 14, secured to each of<br>
the arms 240A, 240B and 240C are spaced apart spacers 242A, 242B<br>
and 242C, respectively, of which spacers 242 A and 242C extend<br>
