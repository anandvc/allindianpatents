CROSS-REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U. S. Provisional Application No. 60/530,599<br>
entitled "Method and Apparatus for Personalization and Identity Management", filed December<br>
17th 2003, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The present invention generally relates to identity management in e-business. More<br>
specifically, the present invention relates to identity management, authentication, user<br>
preference and profiles that may be accessed from different locations and different devices, such<br>
as in the mobile space.<br>
[0003] Various techniques have been used to manage user identities. Typically, to gain access to<br>
a network application or server, a user provides the application or server provider with identity<br>
information that identifies the user. The user is then given an login identifier that may be used to<br>
access the application or server. In some instances, the application/server may also create a user<br>
profile which stores preferences of the user. The application provider may send a cookie or<br>
authentication token to the application (e. g., web browser) or device (e. g. , user's machine) that<br>
the user is using to access the application. Thus, information, such as login identification, user<br>
preferences, transaction history, etc., may be saved for the next time the user accesses the<br>
network application. However, the user's personalization information (user preferences,<br>
transaction history, etc.) cannot be shared across different providers. Additionally, the user<br>
identification is known to the service provider.<br>
[0004] Other existing technologies allow a user to use one login identifier to access multiple<br>
applications. One example of this technology is a Single-Sign-On (SSO), such as Oracle Single<br>
Sign-On Offerings. The SSO is valid for one session between applications that have the<br>
particular SSO "hard coded" in the program code. As the SSO is valid for only the single<br>
session, personalization of the applications is not provided by the SSO. Furthermore, the user<br>
identity is known to all of the applications.<br>
[0005] Another existing approach includes use of a centralized identity management across<br>
different service providers, such as Microsoft Passport technology. The service provider must<br>
include program code in the application that allows the identity/authentication provider to<br>
authenticate the user. The customer must then use the single identity/authentication provider to<br>
logon to the services. This may increase the risk of privacy issues and violations.<br>
Furthermore, service providers then become tied to the identity/authentication provider. This<br>
may be perceived as an unacceptable monopoly risk to some service providers, especially<br>
telecommunication, mobile network operators (MNOs) and banking providers.<br>
[0006] Federated identity management is another approach that may provide for distributed<br><br><br>
single sign-on across providers. One such federation is the Liberty Alliance Project<br>
(http://www.projectliberty.org).	An	overview	maybe	found	at:<br>
http://www.projectliberty.0rg/specs/liberty-architecture-overview-vl.0.pdf. Federated identity<br>
management allows the authentication of a user by a member of the federation to serve as the<br>
authentication for other members of the federation. However, there is no mechanism provided<br>
that allows for masking of the user identity or for sharing of user preferences or other user<br>
personalization information across providers.<br>
[0006A] WO02/102016A discloses a central access management system to control access to<br>
service providers. However, this patent requires the user to maintain a long-term relationship<br>
with an access provider. WO02/33516A discloses a method of secure, anonymous web-<br>
browsing. This is achieved by directing web access requests through a secure server.<br>
WO01/65380A also discloses a method of anonymous web-browsing using a private portal<br>
server computer.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007] Methods and systems are disclosed for personalization and identity management. In one<br>
embodiment, the method comprises receiving a first message for a service provider, the first<br>
message associated with a first identifier of a user; obtaining a second identifier; disassociating<br>
the first identifier from the first message; associating the first message with the second<br>
identifier; and sending the first message associated with the second identifier to the service<br>
provider; wherein the method is characterised in that: the first message is received from a first<br>
access provider and is associated with a first identifier of a user of the first access provider; the<br>
second identifier is associated with the first access provider; and the method further comprises:<br>
receiving, from a second access provider, a second message for the service provider, the second<br>
message associated with a third identifier of a user of the second access provider; determining if<br>
the third identifier is mapped to the first identifier; disassociating the third identifier from the<br>
message; associating the second message with a fourth identifier wherein if the determination is<br>
positive the fourth identifier equals the second identifier; and sending the second message<br>
associated with the fourth identifier to the service provider. In some embodiments, an indication<br>
that the second identifier has been authenticated may also be sent to the service provider.<br>
[0008] In some embodiments, the method may include retrieving personalization information<br>
associated with the second identifier and sending a subset of the personalization information to<br>
the service provider. By way of example, the personalization information may include user<br>
preferences, user device characteristics, user device capabilities, user device settings, user device<br>
addresses, and other user personalization information. The method may optionally include a<br>
determination that the service provider is authorized to have the personalization information<br><br><br>
before the information is sent. Personalization information may have been received from the<br>
user, the service provider, and/or derived from user history.<br>
[0009] Alternately, or additionally, the method may also include associating a session to the<br>
second identifier and associating the message received from the access provider to the session.<br>
The message and one or more additional message (s) received from the access provider, which<br>
are associated to the first identifier, may be evaluated for session management information. The<br>
session management information may be stored for future retrieval in the event the connection to<br>
the service provider is lost and re-established.<br>
[0010] Subsequent to receiving the message from the access provider, a message may be<br>
received for the service provider from a second access provider. The message may be associated<br>
with a third identifier of the user. The method may then include determining the third identifier<br>
is mapped to the first identifier. The third identifier is disassociated from the message and the<br>
second identifier is associated with the message. The second message associated with the second<br>
identifier is sent to the service provider.<br>
[0011] In an alternate embodiment, the method may comprise receiving a message from a<br>
mobile network operator for a service provider. The received message may be associated with a<br>
MSISDN of a user. An identifier is obtained and authenticated. The MSISDN is disassociated<br>
from the message and the obtained identifier is associated with the message.<br>
The message is then sent to the service provider with an indication the identifier has been<br>
authenticated. Personalization information indicating preferences of the user is also sent to the<br>
service provider.<br>
[0012] In a third embodiment, a system is disclosed. The system comprises an identity<br>
component, configured to disassociate a first identifier of a user from a first message received<br>
from a first access provider, obtain a second identifier for the user, and to associate the second<br>
identifier with the first message; an authentication component, configured to authenticate the<br>
second identifier, and to associate an indication with the first message the second identifier has<br>
been authenticated; and a communications interface to send the first message associated with the<br>
second identifier and the indication to the service provider; wherein the system is characterised<br>
in that: the identity component is further configured to dissociate a third identifier of a user from<br>
a second message received from a second access provider, determine whether the third identifier<br>
is mapped to the first identifier and to associate a fourth identifier with the second message,<br>
wherein if the determination is positive the fourth identifier equals the second identifier; the<br>
authentication component is further configured to authenticate the fourth identifier, and to<br>
associate an indication with the second message the fourth identifier has been authenticated; and<br><br><br>
the communications interface is configured to send the second message associated with the<br>
fourth identifier and the indication to the service provider.<br>
[0013] A further understanding of the nature and advantages of the present invention may be<br>
realized by reference to the remaining portions of the specification and the drawings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0023] In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details<br>
are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be<br>
apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without<br>
some of these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown<br>
in block diagram form.<br>
[0024] Fig. 1 illustrates an exemplary embodiment of a system that may be used to provide<br>
identity management to a user. A user may use an access provider 102 to access a network.<br>
The network may be a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), a wireless<br>
network, or other type of network. Thus, the access provider 102 may be an Internet Services<br>
Provider, a mobile network operator (MNO) or other type of provider to a wireless<br>
communications network, a provider to a wireless network (e. g., General Packet Radio Service<br>
(GPRS) network, a WiFi network, 2. 5G, EDGE, UMTS, 3G, CDMA, FOMA, etc.).<br>
In some embodiments, the user may be accessing the network from a device that is mobile.<br><br><br>
By way of example, the mobile device may be a laptop, a personal data assistant (PDA), a<br>
mobile telephone, or other type of device. In other embodiments, the user device may be<br>
relatively stationary, such as a personal computer.<br>
[0025] A user may use the network access provided by access provider 102 to interact with one<br>
or more service providers 108,110. A variety of different types of services may be offered by a<br>
service provider 108,110. For instance, a service provider 108, 110 may provide email services,<br>
voice mail services, messaging services (e. g. , text messaging, instant<br> messaging, MMS,<br>
voice chat, etc.), or application services. By way of example, application services may include a<br>
web site that allows the user to purchase goods or services; an application to find the location,<br>
presence or availability of somebody; an application to synchronize data with a repository; an<br>
application to provision/manage the life cycle of data, applications, or devices; or an application<br>
to access a particular domain. It should be appreciated that a wide range of other types of<br>
services may also be provided by a service provider 108, 110.<br>
[0026] The user device (not illustrated) has an associated identifier which allows access provider<br>
102 to send messages to it. By way of example, an identifier may be a network interface card<br>
(NIC), a mobile identification number (MIN), mobile station ISDN (MSISDN), EMI, SIM<br>
information, or USIM information. Messages sent from the user device to service providers<br>
108,110 via access provider 102 generally have the identifier associated with the message so that<br>
the service provider 108,110 may send messages back to the user. However, in some instances,<br>
for privacy, or other reason, the user may not want the service provider to know the identifier.<br>
For example, a user of a mobile telephone may not want the service provider 108, 110 to know<br>
the user's mobile identification number.<br>
[0027] Identity provider 104 may be used to mask the address of a user from the service<br>
providers 108,110. As will be described in further detail below, the identity provider 104 may<br>
obtain a different identifier for the user. Identity provider 104 may disassociate the first<br>
identifier from messages sent from the user and in replacement, associate the messages with a<br>
second identifier. The messages associated with the second identifier may then be sent to the<br>
service provider 108,110 to which the message was directed. In some instances, identity<br>
provider 104 may also authenticate the second identifier and send an indication along with the<br>
message that the second identifier has been authenticated. Service providers 108,110 route<br>
messages back to the user to identity provider 104. Identity provider may then replace the<br>
second identifier associated with the messages received from service provider 108,110 with the<br>
first identifier and send the message to access provider 102 for delivery to the user.<br><br><br>
Thus, the user may conduct transactions with a service provider 108,110 without providing any<br>
identification information, such as the user device address, name, email address, phone number,<br>
or other identifying information.<br>
[0028] Fig. 2 illustrates an exemplary embodiment of an identity provider 104. The identity<br>
provider 104 includes an identity manager 204. The identity manager 204 may be used to obtain<br>
a identifier for a user for the purposes of masking the user identification from a service provider<br>
108,110. In some instances, a new identifier may be created for the user address. In other<br>
instances, the identity manager 204 may determine that an identifier already exists for the user.<br>
For example, the identifier used for masking may have already been assigned to another<br>
identifier of the user. As another example, the identifier may be assigned to multiple additional<br>
identifiers for the same user (e. g. , a user using multiple access providers and/or devices), each<br>
of which are mapped to the identifier. The same identifier may be used to access multiple<br>
service providers 108,110. Alternately, different identifiers may be obtained for each service<br>
provider to mask the identity of the user from the service provider.<br>
[0029] The identity manager 204 may then pass the identifier used for masking to an<br>
authentication manager 206 to authenticate the identifier. This may be done based on credentials<br>
received from access provider. Credentials may include tokens, cookies digital certificates, SIM<br>
authentication, or other types of tokens. In some instances, challenge responses may be sent to<br>
the user device to authenticate the user. After the identifier has been authenticated, the<br>
authentication manager 206 may then notify the identity manager 204 the identifier has been<br>
authenticated. Identity manager 206 may then transmit messages associated with the identifier,<br>
with an indicator the identifier has been authenticated.<br>
[0030] In one embodiment, identity manager 204 may receive messages from access provider<br>
102, mask the user identity, and send the messages with the masked identification to service<br>
provider 110. Identity manager 204 may also be used to route messages received from service<br>
provider 108, 110 to the user by replacing the masked identifier associated with the messages<br>
with the user's identity for the access provider. Thus, when the masked identifier is mapped to<br>
multiple user identities for one or more access providers, the identity manager 204 may keep<br>
track of the current identifier to use to send messages.<br>
[0031] In other embodiments, messages may be sent to an intermediary such as<br>
session/personalization manager 202, which may use identity manager 204 to obtain a masked<br>
identification for the user. Thus, identity provider 104 may optionally include<br>
session/personalization manager 202 or other type of intermediary to receive messages from<br>
access provider 102, obtain an masked identifier from identity manager 102, replace the access<br>
provider's identification of the user with the masked identifier, and send the message to the<br><br><br>
service provider 108,110. As previously described, identity manager 102 may authenticate the<br>
masked identifier; thus, the session/personalization manager 202 (or other type of intermediary)<br>
may also send indications with the message (s) that the identifier used for masking has been<br>
authenticated. Session/personalization manager 202 or other type of intermediary may also be<br>
used to re-route messages received from service provider 108, 110 to the user by replacing the<br>
identifier with the access provider's identification of the user.<br>
[0032] Session/personalization manager 202 may also be used to share user personalization<br>
information across multiple service providers 108,110 and/or to perform session management in<br>
the event a user switches to a different access provider or uses a different device to access the<br>
service provider 108. A detailed description of how session management may be performed<br>
when a user roams (switches access provider) or uses a second device to access a service<br>
provider may be found in Application Serial No. 10/856,5607, filed May 28, 2004, entitled"<br>
ROAMING ACROSS DIFFERENT ACCESS MECHANISMS AND NETWORK<br>
TECHNOLOGIES", issued Jan 23, 2007 as US Patent No. 7167705, the details of which are<br>
hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
[0033] The identifier assigned to the user may be associated to a session for service provider<br>
108,110. Messages from the user to the service provider 108,110 received over a predetermined<br>
period of time (the user session with the service provider) may then be associated to the session.<br>
Session manager 202 may evaluate the messages for session management information. The<br>
session management information may include data representing a state of the interaction<br>
between the user and the service provider, user preferences within a state or session, and/or other<br>
types of session information. As will be described in more detail below, session management<br>
information may be used to support different types of roaming by the user (e. g. , suspend and<br>
resume, connect/intermittently disconnected/disconnect, and multi-device roaming).<br>
Session/personalization manager 202 may use data storage 208 to store the session management<br>
information.<br>
[0034] Additionally, session/personalization manager 202 may manage user personalization<br>
information. Session/personalization manager 202 may retrieve personalization information<br>
associated with the identifier from data storage 208. A subset of the personalization information<br>
may be sent to service provider 108,110. In some instances, the subset may include all of the<br>
personalization information, while in other instances, only personalization information<br>
applicable to the service provider 108,110 or for which the service provider 108,110 is<br>
authorized to have, may be sent. In embodiments in which different identifiers for each service<br>
provider 108, 110 are provided to mask the user's identity, the personalization information may<br><br><br>
be mapped to all of the identifiers so that personalization information may be shared across<br>
multiple service providers 108, 110.<br>
Alternately, a subset of generic personalization information may be mapped to each of the<br>
multiple identifiers, while application-specific personalization information may only be mapped<br>
to the identifier for the service provider 108,110 of the specific application.<br>
[0035] Personalization information may include a variety of different types of information.<br>
For instance, personalization information may include generic user preferences, preferences or<br>
other personalization information related to applications, such as payment information or<br>
preferences (e. g., M-commerce, e-Wallet, or other information specifying the user preferences<br>
and accounts used to make payments), application settings, account information, contact/address<br>
book information, or other types of application specific information.<br>
Personalization information may also include information related to devices, such as device<br>
settings, unified messaging (UM) priority list on where/how to be contacted, or privacy rules).<br>
Other examples of personalization information include user credentials, user subscriptions to<br>
services including preferences and privacy settings, user devices (e. g., device <br><br><br>
characteristics/capabilities, device settings, device addresses, etc.), network/access<br><br>
mechanisms characteristics (e. g., multi-channel, multimodal, voice, etc. ), and other types of<br>
information storing preferences or other information about the user. The user personalization<br>
information may be explicitly set or provided by the user. Alternately or additionally,<br>
session/personalization manager 202 may derive preferences or personalization information<br>
from messages sent between user and service providers 108,110. In embodiments in which the<br>
session/personalization manager 202 derives personalization management, Platform for Privacy<br>
Preferences (P3P) may be used for some applications to determine the type of information that is<br>
being transmitted by the messages.<br>
[0036] Session/personalization manager 202 may send personalization information to a service<br>
provider 108,110 at the time the user initiates a session with the service provider or at other<br>
times, such as during an on-going session, that preference information may be used to establish a<br>
context related to the user. The personalization information may also or alternately be sent in<br>
response to receiving a request form the service provider 108,110. For example, the<br>
session/personalization manager 202 may have previously received one or more cookies<br>
associated with the identifier from a service provider 108,110. Instead of forwarding the cookies<br>
to the user device, the session/personalization manager 202 may store the cookies in data storage<br>
208. When the service provider requests the cookie (s), session/personalization manager 202<br>
may retrieve the cookie (s) from data storage 208 and send the cookie (s) to the service provider<br>
108,110. Thus, session/personalization manger 202 may serve as a cookie proxy for the service<br><br><br>
provider. Other types of personalization information may also be sent at the service provider's<br>
108,110 request.<br>
[0037] A variety of techniques may be used to ensure that the service provider 108,110 only<br>
receives authorized personalization information. For example, a service provider may have<br>
access to personalization information indicating application settings, such as background color,<br>
but not have any access to identity information. Before sending personalization information, the<br>
session/personalization manager 202 may therefore determine whether the service provider<br>
108,110 is authorized to have the personalization information. Session/personalization manager<br>
202 may request authorization from the user before sending information (e. g., via a "pop-up"<br>
message), or may consult rules (either default or set by the user) to determine what types of<br>
information may be sent. In some embodiments, service providers 108,110 may have access to<br>
data storage 208, but the information may be filtered so that only authorized information may be<br>
viewed, retrieved, or modified by service provider 108,110. Other mechanisms may also be used<br>
to prevent unauthorized accessing or sending of personalization information.<br>
[0038] It should be appreciated that in alternate embodiments, the identity provider 104 may be<br>
different than that depicted in Fig. 2. For instance, identity provider 104 may not include an<br>
authentication manager 206 and may instead use an authentication manager provided by a third<br>
party. As another example, session/personalization manager 202 may be separate components or<br>
may only provide either session or personalization management, but not both. As a third<br>
example, a different data storage may be used to store personalization information than the data<br>
storage used to store session management information. Other alternations are also contemplated.<br>
[0039] One example embodiment in which a user may use identity provider 104 to mask<br>
identities is for interactions with a payment provider. The user may login to a merchant site<br>
using an identity manager, such as described with Fig. 1, to mask identity. After the user selects<br>
the items for purchase and is ready to pay, the merchant may send the user's masked identity to a<br>
payment provider. The merchant may also send other personalization, preference, or profile<br>
information. The payment provider may then use a protocol such as 3- Domain Secure protocol<br>
to obtain authentication for the user. In some embodiments, the identity manager may be used to<br>
authenticate the user. Thus, the payment provider may only know that the user has been<br>
authenticated and may not know the user identity, payment authorization, or account<br>
information. If needed, the payment provider may interact with the user through identity<br>
manager for confirmation or other information needed to authorize the transaction. Upon<br>
completion, payment provider may request that identity manager bill the account setup by the<br>
service provider. The identity provider 104 may then send the user a bill for the payment amount<br>
or may send the bill information to the access provider 102 for combination with the access<br><br><br>
provider bill. Alternately, the payment provider may send a bill notification to the user using<br>
identity manager (e. g., sending an email).<br>
[0040] Fig. 3 illustrates an exemplary system 300 that may be used to support identification<br>
masking for a user when the user switches access providers. The user may switch from an access<br>
provider 302 to a second access provider 304 in a variety of circumstances. For instance, the<br>
user may be using a mobile device (e. g., mobile telephone) which roams to a different network.<br>
As another example, the user may switch from one type of access provider (e. g. , from a<br>
General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) access provider) to a second type of<br> access<br>
provider (e. g. , a WiFi provider). The user may also switch access providers when switching<br>
from a first device to a second device that uses a different access provider to access a network.<br>
The user may also switch between access providers on various other occasions, such as when<br>
switching from one WiFi network to another or switching from WiFi to 3 G or GPRS.<br>
Sometimes, when the user switches to a different access provider, the identity of the user for the<br>
different access providers may stay the same. By way of example, when roaming from one<br>
MNO network to a second MNO network, the user's identification (e. g. , the MS1SDN number)<br>
remains the same. In other instances, the user may change identities, such as when switching<br>
devices or switching to a different type of access provider.<br>
[0041] FIG. 3 illustrates an embodiment in which both access providers 302,304 use the same<br>
identity provider 306 to provide identity management. After the user has switched access<br>
providers 302,304, the identity manager 306 receives one or more message (s) for service<br>
provider 310 from the second access provider. If the user identity for the second access provider<br>
has not changed from the identity for the first access provider, the identity manager 306 may<br>
continue to disassociate the access providers' identification of the user from messages sent from<br>
the user to the service provider 310 and associate the masked identifier mapped to the access<br>
provider's identification of the user (which was obtained when messages were received from<br>
access provider 302) with the messages. Messages sent from service provider 310 to the<br>
identifier are routed to the user via the second access provider 304 using the access provider's<br>
identification of the user.<br>
[0042] In many instances, the user's identity will change when switching from the first access<br>
provider 302 to the second address provider 304. In some embodiments, the access providers<br>
302,304 may be members of a federation in which the access providers 302,304 have agreed that<br>
authentication for user identity for one member (access provider 302) will serve as<br>
authentication for an identity maintained by a different member (access provider 304). Thus,<br>
identity provider 104 (e. g., in an identity manager 204 component) may maintain a mapping of<br>
the identifiers a user has with various access providers 302,304. As the identity provider 104<br><br><br>
maintains this information, the access providers 302, 304 may not know the identities the user<br>
has with other access providers. The user may also provide some of the mappings to identity<br>
provider 306.<br>
[0043] After receiving a message associated with a third identifier of a user (the identifier used<br>
by a second access provider) via the second access provider 304, the identity provider 306<br>
determines the third identifier is mapped to the first identifier associated with messages received<br>
from the first access provider 302. The identity provider 306 then disassociates the third<br>
identifier from the message and associates the second message with the masked identifier which<br>
was mapped to the first identifier. The message associated with the masked identifier is then sent<br>
to service provider 310.<br>
[0044] In some embodiments, the user may switch devices, but use the same access provider. In<br>
those embodiments, the messages associated with the third identifier may have been sent from<br>
the same access provider. The identity provider 306 may use mappings to determine the masked<br>
identifier associated with the first identifier should also be used to mask the identity of the third<br>
identifier. Additionally, as was previously described, in some embodiments, identity provider<br>
306 may also provide session and/or personalization management. When the user switched<br>
access providers 302,304 (or switched to a different address), the connection to service provider<br>
310 may have been terminated. After the connection has been re-established by the second<br>
access provider, the identity provider 306 may determine the masked identifier is associated<br>
with a session with the service provider.<br>
The identity provider 306 may then send (or otherwise make available) session management<br>
information to the service provider 310. Thus, the user may resume interactions with the service<br>
provider 310 at the same, or close to the same, state as when the connection was terminated.<br>
[0045] Fig. 4 illustrates a second exemplary embodiment of a system 400 that may be used to<br>
support identification masking for a user when the user switches access providers. In this<br>
embodiment, the access providers 402,404 use different identity providers 406,408. The access<br>
providers 402,404 may have a federation agreement that allows identity providers 406,408 to<br>
have access to mapping information which associates the identities a user has with various<br>
access providers 302,304. The system includes a data storage 410 which is reachable by both<br>
access providers 402,404. The data storage 410 may be used to store mappings between the<br>
user's identities with various access providers to one or more masked identifiers used for<br>
interacting with service providers.<br>
[0046] After identity provider 406 has obtained a masked identifier for a first identifier<br>
associated with access provider 402, the identity provider 406 may store the mapping from the<br>
first identifier to the masked identifier in data storage 410. Thus, when the second identity<br><br><br>
provider 408 receives a message from access provider 404 associated with the third identifier<br>
(used by the second access provider), it may first consult the data storage 410 to determine if a<br>
masked identifier has been assigned to the third identifier. In some embodiments, the data<br>
storage 410 may also map different identities that the user has with different access providers<br>
402,404. In these embodiments, a search for a masked identifier associated with the third<br>
identifier may return the masked identifier assigned to the first identifier (used by the first access<br>
provider). Alternately, access provider 404 may search data storage using all the different<br>
identities associated with the third identifier of the user.<br>
The access provider 404 may then use the same masked identifier mapped to the first identifier<br>
to mask the third identification of the user from transactions with the service provider 412.<br>
[0047] In addition to the mappings which map the masked identifiers assigned by identity<br>
providers 406,408 to identities a user has with one or more access providers 402,404, data<br>
storage 410 or a different data storage may also store session or personalization information<br>
mapped to the identifier. Thus, identity provider 408 may send the session and personalization<br>
information to service provider 412 as needed or requested. Alternately, identity providers<br>
406,408 may not have direct access to the session/personalization information stored by the<br>
other identity provider. In these embodiments, the second identity provider 408 may request that<br>
the first identity provider 406 send the session and personalization information to the second<br>
identity provider 408 or to the service provider 412.<br>
[0048] Fig. 5 illustrates exemplary wireless networks with may be accessed by a user via an<br>
access provider. Wireless network technologies include wireless wide area network (WWAN),<br>
wireless local area network (WLAN) and wireless personal area network (WPAN) technologies.<br>
WWAN technologies typically include cellular and related technologies such as GSM, GPRS,<br>
CDPD, CDMA, TDMA, WCDMA, etc. WWAN networks are high power, long range networks<br>
that typically have an access range on the order of several kilometers on up. WLAN<br>
technologies, on the other hand, are medium power, medium range networks that have an access<br>
range on the order of tens of meters while WPAN networks are low power, short range networks<br>
that typically have an access range of about 10 meters or less.<br>
Examples of WLAN technologies include the IEEE 802. 11 (a), (b), (e) and (g) technologies and<br>
examples of WPAN technologies include Bluetooth, HomeRF, IrDA and IEEE 802.15<br>
technologies. It should be appreciated that networks, other than wireless networks, may be made<br>
accessible to a user via an access provider.<br>
[0049] Figure 6 illustrates one embodiment of a computer system 600 upon which a identity<br>
provider (or components of an identity provider) may be implemented. The computer system<br>
600 is shown comprising hardware elements that may be electrically coupled via a bus 655. The<br><br><br>
hardware elements may include one or more central processing <br><br> units (CPUs) 605;<br>
one or more input devices 610 (e. g., a mouse, a keyboard, etc.); and one or<br> more output<br>
devices 615 (e. g. , a display device, a printer, etc.). The computer system 600 may also include<br>
one or more storage device 620. By way of example, storage device (s) 620 may be disk drives,<br>
optical storage devices, solid-state storage device such as a random access memory ("RAM")<br>
and/or a read-only memory ("ROM"), which can be programmable, flash-updateable and/or the<br>
like.<br>
[0050] The computer system 600 may additionally include a computer-readable storage media<br>
reader 625; a communications system 630 (e. g. , a modem, a network card (wireless or<br><br>
wired), an infra-red communication device, etc. ) ; and working memory 640, which may<br>
include RAM and ROM devices as described above. In some embodiments, the computer<br>
system 600 may also include a processing acceleration unit 635, which can include a DSP, a<br>
special-purpose processor and/or the like<br>
[0051] The computer-readable storage media reader 625 can further be connected to a computer-<br>
readable storage medium, together (and, optionally, in combination with storage device (s) 620)<br>
comprehensively representing remote, local, fixed, and/or removable storage devices plus<br>
storage media for temporarily and/or more permanently containing computer- readable<br>
information. The communications system 630 may permit data to be exchanged with a network<br>
and/or any other computer.<br>
[0052] The computer system 600 may also comprise software elements, shown as being<br>
currently located within a working memory 640, including an operating system 645 and/or other<br>
code 650, such as an application program. The application programs may implement an identity<br>
provider, components of the identity provider, and/or the methods of the invention. It should be<br>
appreciate that alternate embodiments of a computer system 600 may have numerous variations<br>
from that described above. For example, customized hardware might also be used and/or<br>
particular elements might be implemented in hardware, software (including portable software,<br>
such as applets), or both. Further, connection to other computing devices such as network<br>
input/output devices may be employed.<br>
[0053] Fig. 7 illustrates an exemplary method that may be used to mask user identification.<br>
The method may begin by receiving 702 a message for a service provider. The message is<br>
associated with a first user identifier and may be received from an access provider which<br>
provides a user device access to a network. A second identifier, which will be used to mask the<br>
user identity, is obtained 704. The second identifier may be obtained 704 by an identity <br><br><br> provider (e. g. , an identity manager 204 component). The second identifier may have<br>
been previously obtained and mapped to the first identifier or a third identifier mapped to the<br><br><br>
first identifier, which is also associated with the user. Alternately, a new identifier may be<br>
created and used for the second identifier.<br>
[0054] The first identifier associated with the message is disassociated 706 from the message<br>
and the obtained second identifier is associated 708 with the message in its place.<br>
Thus, the second identifier may be used to route messages back to an identity provider, which<br>
will replace the second identifier with the first identifier and send to the access provider for<br>
forwarding to the user. After the second identifier has been associated with the message, the<br>
message is sent 710 to the service provider.<br>
[0055] In some embodiments, session and/or personalization information may also be retrieved<br>
712. The session information may have been session information for a session associated with<br>
the obtained second identifier. The session information may be sent 714 to the service provider<br>
so that the user may resume interactions with the session provider in the previous state indicated<br>
by the session information. Personalization information may also be sent 714 to the service<br>
provider which specifies user preferences, device capabilities, and other user personalization<br>
information. Alternately, the service provider may have access to personalization information<br>
(or a subset of the personalization information) associated with the identifier.<br>
[0056] Fig. 8 illustrates an exemplary method that may be used to perform identity management<br>
when a user switches access providers. Subsequent to the receipt 702 of one or more messages<br>
from a first access provider, a message may be received 802 from a second access provider. The<br>
message may be associated with the same user identifier that is used by the first access provider.<br>
For example, this may occur when the user roams to a different network or switches to a<br>
different device which uses a different access provider to access the network. Alternately, the<br>
third identifier of the user associated with the message received from the second access provider<br>
may different from the first identifier associated with messages received from the first access<br>
provider. After the message has been received 802, a determination may be made that the third<br>
identifier is mapped to the first identifier associated with messages received 702 from the first<br>
access provider.<br>
[0057] The third identifier is disassociated 806 from the message. The masked identifier<br>
obtained 704 for the messages associated with the first identifier is associated with the message<br>
from the second access provider. The message is then sent 801 to the service provider.<br>
Optionally, session and/or personalization information may also be sent 812.<br>
[0058] In the foregoing description, for the purposes of illustration, methods were described in a<br>
particular order. It should be appreciated that in alternate embodiments, the methods may be<br>
performed in a different order than that described. Additionally, the methods may include fewer,<br>
additional, or different blocks than those described. It should also be appreciated that the<br><br><br>
methods described above may be performed by hardware components or may be embodied in<br>
sequences of machine-executable instructions, which may be used to cause a machine, such as a<br>
general-purpose or special-purpose processor or logic circuits programmed with the instructions<br>
to perform the methods. These machine- executable instructions may be stored on one or more<br>
machine readable mediums, such as CD-ROMs or other type of optical disks, floppy diskettes,<br>
ROMs, RAMs, EPROMs, EEPROMs, magnetic or optical cards, flash memory, or other types of<br>
machine-readable mediums suitable for storing electronic instructions. Alternatively, the<br>
methods may be performed by a combination of hardware and software.<br>

described in detail herein, it is to be understood that the inventive concepts may be otherwise<br>
variously embodied and employed, and that the appended claims are intended to be construed to<br>
include such variations, except as limited by the prior art.<br><br><br><br><br>
