				<td>METHOD FOR PRODUCING (METH)ACROLEIN OR<br>
(METH)ACRYLIC ACID AND REACTOR THEREFOR<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a method for<br>
producing unsaturated aldehydes and/or unsaturated acids<br>
from at least one compound selected from the group<br>
consisting of propylene, propane, (meth)acrolein,<br>
isobutylene, t-butyl alcohol, methyl-t-butyl ether and o-<br>
xylene, by means of fixed-bed catalytic partial oxidation in<br>
a shell-and-tube heat exchange type reactor, as well as to a<br>
fixed-bed shell-and-tube heat exchange type reactor used in<br>
the above method.	<br>
Background Art<br>
A process for producing unsaturated aldehydes and/or<br>
unsaturated acids from olefins is a typical example of<br>
catalytic vapor phase oxidation.<br>
To perform the partial oxidation of olefins, a<br>
multimetal oxide containing molybdenum and bismuth or<br>
vanadium or a mixture thereof is used as a catalyst.<br>
Typically, the partial oxidation of olefins may be<br>
exemplified by a process for producing (meth)acrolein or<br>
(meth)acrylic acid by oxidizing propylene or isobutylene, a<br>
process for producing phthalic anhydride by oxidizing<br>
naphthalene or ortho-xylene or a process for producing<br>
maleic anhydride by partially oxidizing benzene, butylene or<br>
butadiene.<br>
Generally, propylene or isobutylene is subjected to<br>
two-step catalytic vapor phase partial oxidation to form<br>
(meth)acrylic acid as a final product. More particularly, in<br>
the first step, propylene or isobutylene is oxidized By<br><br>
oxygen, diluted inert gas, water vapor and an optional<br>
amount of catalyst to form (meth)acrolein as a main product.<br>
In the second step, (meth)acrolein obtained from the<br>
preceding step is oxidized by oxygen, diluted inert gas,<br>
water vapor and an optional amount of catalyst to form<br>
(meth) acrylic acid. The catalyst used in the first step is<br>
an oxidation catalyst based on Mo-Bi, which oxidizes<br>
propylene or isobutylene to form (meth) acrolein as a main<br>
product. Additionally, a part of (meth)acrolein is further<br>
oxidized on the same catalyst to form acrylic acid<br>
partially. The catalyst used in the second step is an<br>
oxidation catalyst based on Mo-V, which oxidizes<br>
(meth)acrolein-containing mixed gas produced in the first<br>
step, particularly (meth)acrolein, to form (meth)acrylic<br>
acid as a main product.<br>
Reactors for carrying out the above process are<br>
realized in such a manner that each of the above two steps<br>
are implemented in one system or in two different systems<br>
(see US Patent No. 4,256,783).<br>
In general, catalytic vapor phase oxidation is<br>
implemented as follows. At least one catalyst in the form of<br>
granules is packed into reaction tubes, feed gas is supplied<br>
to a reactor through the reaction tubes and the feed gas is<br>
in contact with the catalyst in the reaction tubes to<br>
perform vapor phase oxidation. Reaction heat generated<br>
during the reaction is removed by heat transfer with a heat<br>
transfer medium, wherein the temperature of the heat<br>
transfer medium is maintained at a predetermined<br>
temperature. Particularly, the heat transfer medium for heat<br>
exchange is provided on the outer surface of the catalytic<br>
tubes to perform heat transfer. A reaction product mixture<br>
containing a desired product is collected via a duct and<br><br>
then sent to a purification step. Generally, catalytic vapor<br>
phase oxidation is a highly exothermic reaction. Therefore,<br>
it is very important to control the reaction temperature in<br>
a specific range and to downsize hot spots in the reaction<br>
zone.<br>
For example, vapor phase partial oxidation of<br>
propylene or isobutylene using a metal oxide catalyst based<br>
on molybdenum-bismuth-iron is an exothermic reaction.<br>
Therefore, it has a problem in that a hot spot (a point<br>
whose temperature is abnormally high) is generated in the<br>
reactor. Such hot spots show a relatively high temperature<br>
compared to other parts of the reactor. Accordingly, in hot<br>
spots, complete oxidation proceeds rather than partial<br>
oxidation, thereby increasing by-products such as COx and<br>
decreasing the yield of (meth)acrylic acid and<br>
(meth)acrolein. Additionally, excessive heat generated in a<br>
hot spot causes migration of molybdenum that is a main<br>
element of the catalyst, resulting in deposition of<br>
molybdenum in a catalytic layer having a relatively low<br>
temperature and pressure drop in the catalytic layer,<br>
degradation of catalytic activity and in shortening of the<br>
lifetime of the catalyst. Therefore, yield of (meth)acrolein<br>
and (meth)acrylic acid decreases.<br>
Generally, various methods are known in order to<br>
control the excessive heat at a hot spot in a catalytic<br>
reaction accompanied with heat generation. Such methods<br>
include a method for reducing the amount of feed gas to<br>
decrease the space velocity and a method of using a reaction<br>
tube having a relatively small inner diameter. However, when<br>
the space velocity decreases, it is not possible to obtain<br>
high productivity in an industrial scale. When the inner<br>
diameter of a reaction tube decreases, it is difficult to<br><br>
manufacture the reactor. Moreover, in the latter case, there<br>
are disadvantages of economically unfavorable high cost<br>
needed for manufacturing the reactor, and increased time and<br>
labor needed for packing a catalyst. For these reasons,<br>
there has been a continuous need for and research into a<br>
method for producing unsaturated aldehydes and/or<br>
unsaturated fatty acids with high yield and high<br>
productivity by using a catalyst stably for a long time,<br>
while avoiding the above problems according to the known<br>
methods.<br>
According to the prior art, disclosed is a reactor for<br>
producing unsaturated aldehydes and/or unsaturated fatty<br>
acids with high yield over a long time while extending the<br>
lifetime of a catalyst, by controlling the excessive<br>
reaction heat at the hot spot and optimizing catalytic<br>
activity and selectivity. Japanese Laid-Open Patent Nos.<br>
Sho53-30688B1 and Hei7-10802A1 disclose a fixed-bed reactor<br>
including a reaction zone for the first step of producing<br>
acrolein as a main product, the reaction zone comprising a<br>
catalytic bed that is formed of a catalyst mixed and diluted<br>
with an inactive material and is packed in such a manner<br>
that the ratio of the inactive material gradually decreases<br>
from the inlet of the reactor toward the outlet of the<br>
reactor, i.e., in the direction of reaction gas flow.<br>
US Patent No. 5,198,581 discloses a fixed-bed multi-<br>
tube type reactor for producing unsaturated aldehydes and<br>
unsaturated fatty acids by means of catalytic vapor phase<br>
oxidation of at least one compound selected from the group<br>
consisting of propylene, isobutylene, t-butyl alcohol and<br>
methyl-t-butyl ether with molecular oxygen or molecular<br>
oxygen-containing gas. The above reactor includes a<br>
plurality of reaction zones each packed with a different<br><br>
composite oxide-based catalyst having a different occupation<br>
volume along the axial direction of each reaction tube,<br>
wherein the volume is controlled so that it decreases from<br>
the gas inlet to the outlet. Korean Laid-Open Patent No.<br>
2001-80871 discloses a method for producing acrolein (ACR)<br>
and acrylic acid (AA) by means of vapor phase oxidation of<br>
propylene with molecular oxygen or molecular oxygen-<br>
containing gas in a fixed-bed cylindrical reactor. According<br>
to the above method, a plurality of catalysts having<br>
different activities are obtained by controlling (a) the<br>
volume occupied by a catalyst, (b) sintering temperature,<br>
and/or (c) kind and/or amount of alkali metal elements.<br>
Additionally, the catalytic bed in each reaction tube is<br>
divided into two or more reaction zones along the axial<br>
direction, the reaction zones being packed with the<br>
catalysts in such a manner that the catalytic activity<br>
increases from the reaction gas inlet to the outlet.<br>
As described in the prior art, the method for packing<br>
a catalyst after it is mixed and diluted with an inactive<br>
material, the method for packing a plurality of composite<br>
oxide-based catalysts having different occupation volumes in<br>
such a manner that the volume gradually decreases, etc.,<br>
have problems in that they are inefficient for commercial<br>
use because the packing ratio of a catalyst varies depending<br>
on the size, shape, specific gravity and density of the<br>
catalyst and inactive material, even though the catalyst is<br>
mixed and diluted with the inactive material at a correct<br>
ratio and then the mixture is packed into a reaction tube.<br>
Additionally, the method for packing a catalyst by<br>
controlling the catalytic activity through the control of<br>
the occupation volume, sintering temperature and/or kind<br>
and/or amount of alkali metal elements in the catalyst<br><br>
having a specific composition can reduce the temperature of<br>
a hot spot generated during the catalytic reaction, thereby<br>
minimizing degradation of catalyst and side reactions.<br>
However, the method is problematic in that the hot spot<br>
still maintains high temperature.<br>
Therefore, there is a continuous need for a method for<br>
minimizing degradation of catalyst and side reactions caused<br>
by extreme heat generation at a hot spot generated during<br>
the catalytic reaction.<br>

Disclosure of the Invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a<br>
method for producing unsaturated aldehydes and/or<br>
unsaturated fatty acids with high yield in a stable manner<br>
for a long time, the method including estimating the<br>
position of a hot spot in a reaction tube and packing an<br>
inactive material layer into the hot spot to reduce heat<br>
generation at the hot spot, thereby facilitating heat<br>
control and/or to disperse a temperature distribution toward<br>
a reaction gas outlet.<br>
According to an aspect of the present invention, there<br>
is provided a method for producing unsaturated aldehydes or<br>
unsaturated fatty acids from at least one compound selected<br>
from the group consisting of propylene, propane,<br><br>
(meth)acrolein, isobutylene, t-butyl alcohol, methyl-t-butyl<br>
ether and o-xylene by means of fixed-bed catalytic partial<br>
oxidation in a shell-and-tube reactor, characterized in that<br>
the reactor includes a reaction zone for producing<br>
unsaturated aldehydes as a main product, the reaction zone<br>
having an inactive material layer inserted into a position<br>
where a hot spot is to be generated in a reaction tube.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention,<br>
there is provided a shell-and-tube reactor that may be used<br>
in a method for producing unsaturated aldehydes or<br>
unsaturated fatty acids from at least one compound selected<br>
from the group consisting of propylene, propane,<br>
(meth)acrolein, isobutylene, t-butyl alcohol, methyl-t-butyl<br>
ether and o-xylene by means of fixed-bed catalytic partial<br>
oxidation, characterized in that the reactor includes a<br>
reaction zone for producing unsaturated aldehydes as a main<br>
product, the reaction zone having an inactive material layer<br>
inserted into a position where a hot spot is to be generated<br>
in a reaction tube.<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be explained<br>
in detail.<br>
According to the present invention, an inactive<br>
material layer is formed at the position of a hot spot in<br>
the reactor so that partial oxidation at the hot spot can be<br>
prevented, thereby minimizing heat generation at the hot<br>
spot and dispersing the temperature distribution, resulting<br>
in minimization of degradation of catalyst and side<br>
reactions.<br>
As used herein, the term "hot spot" is referred to as<br>
a point where a peak temperature is generated. For example,<br>
a hot spot may be a point where an abnormally high<br>
temperature is maintained due to excessive heat generation<br><br>
or heat accumulation, in a catalytic bed in the reaction<br>
tube of the first-step reaction zone for producing<br>
unsaturated aldehydes as a main product.<br>
A hot spot is formed by the reaction heat generated<br>
during catalytic vapor phase oxidation. The position and<br>
size of a hot spot are determined by many factors including<br>
a reactant composition, space velocity and temperature of<br>
heat transfer medium. Under constant processing conditions,<br>
a hot spot has a constant position and size. Therefore, the<br>
position of a hot spot can be estimated by using a<br>
simulation method, etc.<br>
In general, each catalytic layer has at least one hot<br>
spot. The hot spot in the first-step reaction zone may be<br>
generated at the front part of the catalytic bed for the<br>
first-step oxidation, enriched with a main reactant and<br>
molecular oxygen-. In addition, the hot spot may be generated<br>
at the vicinity of the border of adjacent catalytic layers<br>
having different activities, in the' case' of a reactor<br>
structure packed with two or more catalytic layers in the<br>
first-step reaction zone.<br>
According to the present invention, the position of a<br>
hot spot and the temperature peak size of a hot spot are<br>
quantitatively analyzed based on the temperature profile<br>
(see FIG. 2) of a catalytic bed in a reaction tube. Then, a<br>
predetermined height of an inactive material layer is<br>
inserted into the temperature peak position where a hot spot<br>
is generated so as to prevent partial oxidation at the hot<br>
spot, thereby minimizing heat generation at the hot spot and<br>
dispersing a temperature distribution.<br>
The reactors that may be used in the present invention<br>
include a fixed-bed multi-tube reactor and a conical fixed-<br>
bed multi-tube reactor. There is no particular limitation on<br><br>
the shape of the reactor. In order to form a catalytic bed<br>
needed for carrying out vapor phase partial oxidation, a<br>
catalyst is packed in the reaction tube of a reactor, an<br>
inactive material is packed at the position of a hot spot,<br>
in one layer or two or more layers having different kinds<br>
and sizes of inactive material, and then the catalyst is<br>
further packed in the reaction tube.<br>
In the case of the first-step reaction zone for<br>
producing unsaturated aldehydes as a main product, a<br>
catalytic bed may be packed in one layer having uniform<br>
activity along the axial direction, or in two or more layers<br>
whose catalytic activity gradually increases along the axial<br>
direction, if necessary.<br>
Preferably, the catalyst used in the vapor phase<br>
partial oxidation for producing unsaturated aldehydes as a<br>
main product is a metal oxide represented by the following<br>
formula 1:<br>
[formula 1]<br>
MoaAbBcCdDeEfFgOh<br>
wherein Mo is molybdenum;<br>
A is at least one element selected from the group<br>
consisting of Bi and Cr;<br>
B is at least one element selected from the group<br>
consisting of Fe, Zn, Mnr Cu and Te;<br>
C is at least one element selected from the group<br>
consisting of Co, Rh and Ni;<br>
D is at least one element selected from the group<br>
consisting of W, Si, Al, Zr, Ti, Cr, Ag and Sn;<br>
E is at least one element selected from the group<br>
consisting of P, Te, As, B, Sb, Nb, Mn, Zn, Ce and Pb;<br>
F is at least one element selected from the group<br>
consisting of Na, K, Li, Rb, Cs, Ta, Ca, Mg, Sr, Ba and MgO;<br><br>
and<br>
each of a, b, c, d, e, f and g represents the atomic<br>
ratio of each element, with the proviso that when a=10, b is<br>
a number of between 0.01 and 10,. c is a number of between<br>
0.01 and 10, d is a number of between 0.0 and 10, e is a<br>
number of between 0.0 and 10, f is a number of between 0 and<br>
20, g is a number of between 0 and 10, and h is a number<br>
defined depending on the oxidation state of each of the<br>
above elements.<br>
The catalyst may have a cylindrical or a hollow<br>
cylindrical shape, and there is no particular limitation in<br>
shape of the catalyst. The catalyst preferably has an aspect<br>
ratio (the ratio of length to diameter (outer diameter),<br>
i.e., L/D) of between 1 and 1.3. More preferably, the ratio<br>
of L/D equals 1.<br>
The inactive material layer that may be used in the<br>
present invention may be formed of an inactive material<br>
alone or a mixture of an inactive material with a catalyst.<br>
However, when a mixture of an inactive material with a<br>
catalyst is used, the activity of the mixture should be<br>
lower than that of a catalytic layer in the vicinity of a<br>
hot spot. The volume ratio of the inactive material to the<br>
catalyst in the inactive material layer is preferably 20-<br>
100%, and more preferably 80-100%.<br>
The inactive material that may be used in the present<br>
invention is referred to as material inactive to a reaction<br>
for producing unsaturated aldehydes and/or unsaturated acids<br>
such as catalytic oxidation of propylene/isobutylene. Such<br>
inactive materials include silica, alumina, silica/alumina,<br>
zirconium oxide, titanium oxide, mixtures thereof, etc.<br>
Although there is no particular limitation in shape of<br>
the inactive material, the inactive material may have the<br><br>
shape of a sphere, cylinder, ring, rod, plate, iron net and<br>
mass with a suitable size. If necessary, mixtures of the<br>
above shapes may be used.<br>
When the inactive material has the shape of a sphere,<br>
cylinder and ring, the diameter is preferably 2-10 mm, and<br>
more preferably 5-8 mm. When the inactive material has the<br>
shape of a cylinder and ring, the ratio of length to<br>
diameter (L/D) is preferably 1-1.3, and more preferably is<br>
1. Preferably, the inactive material has the same or similar<br>
shape and/or size as the catalyst.<br>
At the point of a hot spot, the inactive material<br>
layer is packed to the height of 0.1-1000 mm, preferably to<br>
the height of 10-200 mm, in one or more layers, preferably<br>
in one or two layers. The position where the inactive<br>
material layer is disposed in a reaction tube ranges<br>
preferably 1-70% and more preferably 1-50% of the total<br>
length of the whole catalytic bed in the reaction zone<br>
producing unsaturated aldehyde as a main product, when<br>
viewed from the reaction gas inlet toward the outlet.<br>
It is preferable that the temperature at the hot spot<br>
of a reactor is controlled by the inactive material layer<br>
inserted into the hot spot, in such a manner that the<br>
temperature of the hot spot is equal to or lower than<br>
(reaction temperature + 55°C). Accordingly, it is possible to<br>
minimize volatilization of catalytically active components<br>
and to inhibit side reactions caused by excessive heat,<br>
thereby increasing the lifetime of a catalyst and producing<br>
unsaturated aldehydes and unsaturated fatty acids with high<br>
yield.<br>
Vapor phase partial oxidation for producing aldehydes<br>
as a main product in a reactor having an inactive layer at<br>
the hot spot according to the present invention is suitably<br><br>
carried out at a reaction temperature of 200-450°C,<br>
preferably 200-370 °C, under a reaction pressure of 0.1-10<br>
atm, preferably 0.5-3 atm. For example, in order to perform<br>
oxidation, a feed gas including 5-10 volume% of a feed<br>
compound such as propylene, 13 volume% of oxygen, 5-60<br>
volume% of water vapor and 20-80 volume% of an inert gas is<br>
introduced onto a catalyst at a space velocity of 500-5000<br>
hr-1 (STP) .<br>
Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred<br>
embodiments of the present invention. It is to be understood<br>
that the following examples are illustrative only and the<br>
present invention is not limited thereto.<br>
Preparation Example 1<br>
(Preparation of Catalyst)<br>
2500 ml of distilled water was heated with stirring at<br>
70-85°C and 1000 g of ammonium molybdate was dissolved<br>
therein to form solution (1) . To 400 ml of distilled water,<br>
27.4 g of bismuth nitrate, 228 g of iron nitrate and 1.9 g of<br>
potassium nitrate were added and mixed thoroughly. Next, 71<br>
g of nitric acid was added to the mixture and dissolved<br>
therein to form solution (2) . 618 g of cobalt nitrate was<br>
dissolved in 200 ml of distilled water to form solution (3).<br>
Solution (2) was mixed with solution (3) and the combined<br>
solution was further mixed with solution (1), while<br>
maintaining the temperature of the solution at 4 0-60.C, to<br>
form a catalyst suspension.<br>
The suspension obtained as described above was dried<br>
to provide M012Bi1.2Fe1.2Co4.5Ko.04, which was pulverized into a<br>
size of 150 μm or less. The pulverized catalyst powder was<br>
mixed for 2 hours and formed into a cylindrical shape. The<br><br>
formed catalyst had an outer diameter of 4.0-8.0 mm. Then,<br>
the catalyst was baked at 500°C for 5 hours under air to<br>
check the catalytic activity.<br>
Comparative Example 1<br>
To a stainless steel reactor having an inner diameter<br>
of 1 inch and heated with molten nitrate, alumina/silica as<br>
an inactive material was packed to the height of 150 mm, and<br>
then the catalyst obtained from Preparation Example 1 and<br>
having a size of 5 mm(±0.2) was packed to the height of<br>
2900 mm, when viewed from the reaction gas inlet toward the<br>
outlet.<br>

Experimental Example: Catalytic Activity Test<br>
The reactors packed with catalysts according to the<br>
above Examples and Comparative Examples were used to perform<br>
oxidation of propylene, thereby producing acrolein and<br>
acrylic acid. The oxidation was carried out by introducing a<br>
feed gas containing 7 volume% of propylene, 13 volume% of<br>
oxygen, 8 volume% of water vapor and 73 volume% of inert gas<br>
onto the catalyst at the reaction temperature of 320°C,<br>
under the reaction pressure of 0.7 atm, at the apace<br>
velocity of 1400 hr-1 (STP) .<br>
The results obtained from the above Examples and<br>
Comparative Examples are shown in the following Table 1.<br>
In Table 1, the reactant (propylene) conversion ratio,<br>
selectivity and yield are calculated based on the following<br>
mathematical formulae .1 and 2.<br>
[mathematical formula 1]<br>
propylene conversion ratio(%) = [moles of reacted<br>
propylene/moles of supplied propylene] X 100<br>
[mathematical formula 2]<br>
yield(%) of acrolein + acrylic acid = [moles of<br>
produced acrolein and acrylic acid/moles of supplied<br>
propylene] X 100<br>
[Table 1]<br><br><br><br>
As can be seen from Table 1, reactors of Examples 1-4<br>
including at least one layer of inactive material formed at<br>
the point of a hot spot in the catalytic reaction zone<br>
according to the present invention can provide excellent<br>
propylene conversion ratio and yield of a desired product as<br>
well as a lower temperature in the point of heat generation.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
As can be seen from the foregoing, the present<br>
invention provides a method for producing unsaturated<br>
aldehydes and/or unsaturated fatty acids from at least one<br>
compound selected from the group consisting of propylene,<br>
propane, (meth)acrolein, isobutylene, t-butyl alcohol,<br>
methyl-t-butyl ether and o-xylene, by means of fixed-bed<br>
catalytic vapor phase partial oxidation with molecular<br>
oxygen or molecular oxygen-containing gas in a shell-and-<br>
tube heat exchange type reactor. According to the present<br>
invention, it is possible to minimize the heat generation in<br>
hot spots, to disperse a temperature distribution toward an<br>
outlet, and thus to produce unsaturated aldehydes and<br>
unsaturated fatty acids stably with high yield for a long<br>
time, by virtue of at least one layer of inactive material<br>
inserted at the point of a hot spot.<br>
