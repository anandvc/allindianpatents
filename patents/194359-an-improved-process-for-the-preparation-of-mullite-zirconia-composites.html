				<td>This    invention   relates to an  improved  process   for  the<br>
preparation  of mullite-zirconia composites<br>
The  present  invention  particularly  relates  to   an<br>
improved process  for the preparation of dense  mullite-zirconia<br>
composite  employing  reaction sintering method,  using   zircon<br>
flour   and   calcined   alumina  as   raw materials   and  a<br>
new  dopant  "dysprosia".Dysprosium (Dy) with atomic no.  66  is<br>
one    of   the members  of  the  Lanthanide  group  (Cerium<br>
Lutetiume).   The oxide  of Dysprosium is known  as  dysprosium<br>
oxide or dysprosia, Dy2O3 The density of Dy2O3  is 7.81 gm/cc.<br><br>
The   study   on   mullite-zirconia   composites    has<br>
received   major attention because of its  superior  properties<br>
with  respect to refractoriness, chemical  inertness,  mechanical<br>
strength at elevated temperature and also low thermal  expansion.<br>
Most of the zirconia bearing composites  are  expensive because<br>
in  most of the cases  pure  zirconia  is  used as  one  of<br>
the ingredients.  On the other hand sintering of pure mullite  is<br>
difficult  due  to its low lattice diffusion  coefficient and<br>
 requires temperature as high as 1650° to 1700°C. The  <br>
preparation<br>
of  mullite-zirconia  composites through  reaction  sintering<br>
method has  attracted attention of many workers  since good<br>
quality zircon sand is readily available from beach sand which<br>
makes the  process cost effective.  India is fortunately having a<br>
vast reserve of  zircon  sand that can be commercially exploited<br>
for such development.<br>
These composites are now finding application as refractory material in steel industry for making well blocks, continuous casting nozzles and their inserts. Due to the high melting point and excellent chemical properties, one of the major fields of application is in glass industries for lining of port necks, pavings, monolithic subpavings, checkers, burner blocks etc.<br>
The use of the sintering additives  such  as   magesia,<br>
calcium  oxide,  titania and yttria for effective  sintering at<br>
o lower temerature  (1400 C) and for  enhancing  the  sintering<br>
during   preparation   of   mullite-zirconia  composites have<br>
been  extensively studied.<br>

By the use of a new additive/dopant, dysprosia it has been successful in bringing about the overall improvement in the sintering, reaction and thermo-mechanical properties of sintered mullite-zirconia  composites.<br>
^Reaction sintering' is defined as a particular firing process in which chemical reaction of the starting - materials (reactants) and the elimination of porosity in the powder compact i.e. densification are both achieved in a single heat treatment step. This process has been found to be one of the simplest and least expensive methods. Depending upon the processing condition, temperature and particle size both the processes of reaction and densification (sintering) can occur either in sequentially or simultaneously. Zircon is rather a cheap material in comparison with zirconia suggesting its use for the preparation of zirconia based ceramics by reaction sintering routes. Many zirconia bearing ceramics are prepared from naturally occuring zircon. It is an established fact that the mineral zircon as a chemically pure substance decomposes  in  a  solid state at a temperature of 1676 C giving<br>
a mixture of tetragonal zirconia and  -cristobalite.   According<br>
to  the  system  ZrO2-Sio2<br><br>
(Equation Removed) <br>
The reaction sintering involves an in situ reaction between zircon and alumina to form mullite with dispersed zirconia as a second phase.<br>
(Equation Removed) <br>
Alumina   and  zircon react at temperature   greater  than o 1400   C to form mullite with  zirconia   particles   distributed<br>
primarily   along  the  grain  boundary.   The  alumina to zircon<br>
mol  ratio varies  between  1  and  2.   But maximum - amount  of<br>
crystalline mullite and zirconia were  obtained when the ratio<br>
is   1.5.   The  number of contacts between  zircon  and alumina<br>
grains were at a maximum.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of mullite-zirconia composites with high density, high tetragonal zirconia content, low thermal expansion co-efficient, high flexural strength and high fracture toughness.<br>
Another objective of this invention is to provide a simple,   inexpensive  and  easily  adaptable  process  for  the<br>
manufacture of highly dense mullite-zirconia composites employing zircon flour instead of pure expensive zirconia<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to use an additive / dopant, dysprosia (Dy2O3) to accelerate the reaction and sintering processes.<br>
Accordingly   the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of mullite-zirconia composite which comprises:<br>
a)	mixing calcined alumina with the zircon flour in a ratio which ranges from 1 to 2,<br>
b)	adding dysprosia in the range of 2.5 to 4.5 wt% to the mixture obtained in step (a),<br>
c)	attritor milling the mixture obtained in step (b), for a period over 6 hr , in the presence of an organic solvent to obtain submicrometer powder,<br>
d)	drying the powder and adding a binder such as herein described, in the range from 5-15 wt% to the dried product,<br>
e)	pressing the obtained product uniaxially at a pressure in the range of 70 to 100 Mpa followed by isostatic pressing at a pressure in the range of 200 to 300 MPa, followed by<br>
f)	drying and firing at a temperature in the range of 1400 to 1650°C for a period ranging from 1 to 4 hrs to get the mullite-zirconia composite.<br>
The mixture of calcined alumina and zircon flour was  taken<br>
in  the ratio which   ranges from 1 to 2.  Dysprosium oxide  was<br>
added  as an additive to the mixture in the range of 2.5 to  4.5<br>
wt%. The mixture obtained in step (b)  was attritor milled for 6<br>
hrs in the presence of an organic solvent.  The organic  solvent<br>
used in step (c) may be isopropyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, hexane<br>
or  ethanol.  This dried powder was mixed with the binder.   The<br>
binder  used  in step (d) may be  polyvinyl  alcohol,  dextrine,<br>
glycol    and the amount used may  range  from  5  to 15  wt%<br>
o The  pressed material obtained in step (e) was dried at  110   +<br>
o	'     o        o<br>
5 C and fired at temperatures ranging from 1400  to 1650 C  for<br>
2 hours soaking  period.<br>
The  characteristics of the composite prepared by the<br>
hitherto   known  process  and  the  process  of   the   present<br>
invention  are  summarised below in TABLE - 1.<br>
TABLE  1:<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
Table 1 shows the relative density of the invention, which was measured by Archimedes Principle, to be comparatively higher than the existing ones. Room temperature strength was measured in an Instron machine with three point loading. Fracture Toughness was measured by indenting the samples with Vick-ers' microhardness indenter. Fracture Toughness is much higher and signifies that it can survive a lot more wear and tear  in<br>
use.   Thermal  expansion coefficient which was measured  in a<br>
dilotometer upto 1400 C shows the significantly lower coefficient of expansion. Lower thermal expansion coefficient improves the thermal spalling resistance of the material and it can withstand much larger number of cycles of temperature fluctuations. High temperature flexural strength measured in a 3 point bending strength tester is much higher for the -invention, compared to the products available. One of the factors for the improvement of the properties is the retention of higher percentage tetrogonal zirconia phase, at room temperature measured by X-ray diffraction.<br>
The invention will now be described in detail with the help of following example for carrying out the process in actual practice. However, these examples should not be considered as to limit the scope of the invention as these are produced to illustrate the invention only.<br>
