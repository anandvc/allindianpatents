				<td>TRPVI   AGONISTS,   FORMULATIONS   CONTAINING   THEM   AND USES THEREOF<br>
The   present   invention   relates   to   ricinoleic   acid   derivatives   with agonistic activity towards the vanilloid receptor type-1. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The vanilloid receptor type 1 (VR1 or TRPVI) belongs to the wide family of transient receptor potential cationic channels (TRPV) with six trans-membrane domains. TRPVI is the only TRPV channel that is presently known to be activated by some natural products, capsaicin and resiniferatoxin being the most known and studied (Sterner and Szallasi, Trends Pharmocol. Sci. 1999, 20, 459-465). Its is to date recognized that, while other TRPV channels, such as TRPV2. TRPV3 and TRPV4 (also known as "VRI-like (VRL) receptors"), are solely responsive to mechanical, osmotic or thermal stimuli and are in principle evenly distributed in the various tissues of mammals, TRPVl specifically acts as a molecular integrator of pain stimulation induced, for instance, by heat, protons and vegetable toxins and is mainly expressed in peripheral sensory type C and A5 fibres (Gunthorpe et al.. Trends Pharmacol.<br>
Sci. 2002,23, 183-191).<br>
VR1-Knockout studies on transgenic mice univocally proved the role of TRPVl in partial perception and transmission of "thermal" or "inflammatory-pain (Caterina et al., Science 2000. 288, 306-313; Davis et al. Nature 2000. 405,  183-187). Other studies  suggested that TRPVI   is involved also  in mtestmal    inflammatory   disorders   (Yiangou   et   al.,   Lancet   2001,    557, 1338-1339), neuropatic pain (Walker et al., J. Pharmacol Exp. Ther. 2003, 304. 56-62), fecal incontinence and pathological cough (Chung and Chang, Pulrn.   Pharmacol   Ther.  2002,   15,  335-338). TRPVl   apparently plays  a fundamental role also in the control of urinary bladder function (Birder et al.<br><br>
Nat. Newosci. 2002, 5, 856-860) and in the control of neuronal plasticity, body temperature, iood intake, energy expenditure, and movement (Di Marzo et al., Em. J. Phannacol. 2001, 420, 123-131).<br>
Neurons expressing TPRV1 receptors can be desensitised immediately after activation by some agonists, such as capsaicin. From the practical point of view, the starting burning sensation due to the agonist action is overcome by a paradox effect. VRl tachyphylaxis can also account for other medicinal effects described for capsaicin and chili pepper, such as the well-known anti-emetic and anti-inflammatory effects and the neuroprotective effect against glutamate excitotoxicity. Capsaicin and its analogue resiniferotoxin are also used in the treatment of urinary incontinence (wherein nerve ends characterized by the presence of VR participate in the transmission of the bladder emptying reflex), whereas capsaicin synthetic derivatives, the most known being olvanil, have been patented as oral analgesics. The pharmaceutical industry is, however, still remarkably interested in the development of more potent TRPV1 agonists,<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The compounds of the invention have the following general formula (I)<br>
(Figure Remove) in which<br>
X represents two hydrogen atoms, a 7i-bond, oxygen or methylene;<br>
R2 is a Ce-Ci.) aryl or arylalkyl residue;<br>
R3 is hydrogen, 2-hydroxyethyl or 2-aminoethyl.<br>
R2  is preferably phenyl, benzyl  or phenethyl and  R3  is preferably<br><br>
hydrogen.<br>
These compounds are potent TPVR1 agonists and are therefore useful for the treatment of pain or urinary incontinence or intestinal inflammatory disorders.<br>
The present invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds of formula (I) as active principles in effective amount.<br>
The compounds of the invention can be in racemic or enantiomerically pure form, more preferably 12R. The configuration of the double bond can be E or Z, more preferably Z. The present invention also includes pharmacologically acceptable salts of the compounds of formula (I).<br>
The compounds of the invention can be synthesised for example through the methods reported hereinbelow; other reagents and starting materials can be chosen in order to obtain other compounds of formula (I).<br>
According to the simplest synthetic approach, the compounds of the invention are prepared from ricinoleic acid vanillammide, according to Scheme 1.<br>
Scheme 1(Figure Remove)<br>
Ricinoleic acid vanillamide. prepared according to the literature,  is optionally  subjected to cyclopropanation or epoxidation and the resulting<br>
intermediate is esterified with an appropriate acylaling agent. Activated carboxylic acids derivatives suitable for the esterificalion are acid halides, expecially chlorides, as well as mixed anhydrides or adducts with carbodiimide, according to the methods known in the art. The ester of the para-hydroxyl of the vanillamine residue is subsequently selectively hydrolysed to give the corresponding hydroxy derivative, which is an object of the present invention. If desired, the phenolic hydroxyl can be subsequently etherified with an aminoethyl or a hydroxyethyl residue.<br>
Alternatively, the intermediates useful for the synthesis of the compounds of the present invention can be obtained also starting from trichloroethanol ricinoleate according to Scheme 2.<br>
Scheme 2(Figure Remove)<br>
Trichloroethanol ricinoleate, prepared according to the literature, is acylated at the 12 position with an activated carboxylic acid, similarly to what reported above. The trichloroethyl ester is then selectively hydrolysed to give 12-acylricinoleic acid which is subsequently converted to amide by condensation with vanillamine.<br>
The same methods can be successfully applied to the trans and 12-S isomers, or to the saturated analogous of natural ricinoleic acid.<br>
The biological activity of the products of the invention was measured<br>
both in vitro and in vivo.<br>
The in vitro effect of the compounds of formula (1) on TRPVl was studied by measuring the concentration of intracellular calcium in HEK-293 cells (which overexpress human TRPVl); calcium concentration in the presence of 4 uM ionomycin was taken as the maximum reference value (Hayes el al., Pain 2000,88,205-215). The results are reported in the following table 1.<br>
(Table Remove)<br>
The activity of the compound of example 2 was also evaluated in rats through the in vivo test of induced urinary incontinence.<br>
Sprague Dawley rats (250 ± 10 g) were anaesthetized with chloral hydrate. The urinary bladder was opened through an incision along the abdomen median line, and the adipose tissue surrounding the urethra and ureters was removed. The proximal urethra was then tied up with non-absorbable surgery thread to create partial urethral obstruction. After 8 weeks, alteration of bladder functionality was observed and the cystometric pattern was altered, the number of minctions per hour being particularly increased.<br>
On the treatment day, the compound of example 2, the compound prepared according to Appendino et al. and resiniferotoxin as the reference standard were solubilised in ethanol and instilled in the bladder at the concentration of 50 nM. The instillation lasted 30 min: during this period the infusion pump for the saline was turned off. After incubation, the bladder was emptied of any medicament solution, then the infusion pump was turned on again.<br>
A significant increase in the number of minctions per hour was observed in non treated operated animals. On the contrary, in animals treated with the compound of the invention and with resiniferotoxin the number of minctions remained similar to that of non-operated animals. Very low activity was also observed also for the product of Appendino et al.<br>
The results of the experiment are reported in the following table 2. Table 2(Table Remove)<br>
As potent agonists of the TPRV1 receptor, compounds (I) can be used in the treatment oi'urinary incontinence, in the relief of neuropalic pain and in the therapy of inflammatory intestinal disorders.<br>
The invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising compounds (I) in combination with suitable carriers or diluents. The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be administered through different administration routes, for example through the oral, rectal, intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intrathecal, epidural or intracerebroventricular route. Suitable carriers for injectable formulations comprise oils, propylene or ethylene glycol, physiological solution, ethanol, vegetable oils and isopropyl myristate or other solvents commonly used for the preparation injectable solutions.<br>
To prepare injectable formulations the compounds of the invention can be dissolved, suspended or emulsified in aqueous solvents, such as physiological solution, 5% dextrose, or non-aqueous solvents such as vegetable oil, saturated synthetic glycerides, esters of long-chain aliphatic acids or propylene glycol. The formulations can also include conventional excipients, such as solubilizing agents, isotonic agents, suspending agents, emulsitiers, stabilizing agents and preservatives.<br>
For the topical use, the compounds of the invention can be formulated as creams or ointments.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition of the invention can be used:<br>
-	to   alleviate   pain   caused   by   post-herpetic   neuralgia,   diabetic<br>
neuropathy,    post-mastectomy    syndrome,    sympathetic    reflex    dystrophy.<br>
