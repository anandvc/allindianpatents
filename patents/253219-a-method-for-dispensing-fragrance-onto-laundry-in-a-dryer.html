A FRAGRANCE DISPENSER FOR A DRYER AND A METHOD FOR<br>
DISPENSING FRAGRANCE ONTO FABRIC IN A DRYER<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to a fragrance dispenser for a dryer and to a<br>
method for dispensing fragrance onto fabric in a dryer. The fragrance dispenser can be<br>
placed inside the dryer, and can dispense fragrance onto the fabric in the dryer to<br>
provide the fabric with a residual fragrance as a result of the temperature achieved in<br>
the dryer during the drying cycle. The fragrance dispenser can be constructed for use in<br>
a single drying cycle, or the fragrance dispenser can be constructed for use in multiple<br>
drying cycles.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Air fresheners are commonly available for dispensing a fragrance into a<br>
particular environment such as a room or passenger area of a motor vehicle.<br>
Air fresheners are available that plug into an electrical outlet and rely<br>
upon a small degree of electrical heating to dispense fragrance. Exemplary air<br>
fresheners that plug into electrical outlets are commercially available under the names<br>
GLADE PLUGINS, AER. WICK, and RENUZIT SCENTED OIL A1RLETS.<br>
Exemplary patent documents disclosing plug-in air fresheners include U.S. Patent No.<br>

Summary<br>
A fragrance dispenser is provided according to the invention. A<br>
fragrance dispenser is provided for use in a dryer for dispensing a fragrance onto fabric<br>
or laundry dried in the dryer. The fragrance dispenser includes a mixture of a carrier<br>
component and a fragrance component so that the fragrance dispenser is provided in a<br>
solid form. The carrier component and the fragrance component are selected so that,<br>
when the fragrance dispenser is placed in a dryer and contacts fabric being dried during<br>
a drying cycle at a temperature of up to about 170° F, the carrier component does not<br>
flow onto the fabric, and the fragrance component dispenses in an amount sufficient to<br>
impart a residual fragrance to the fabric.<br>
A method for dispensing fabric onto laundry in a dryer is provided<br>
according to the invention. The method includes a step of drying fabric in an automatic<br>
dryer in the presence of a fragrance dispenser at a dryer temperature of at least about<br>
100° F to provide release of fragrance from the fragrance dispenser to impart a residual<br>
fragrance to the fabric.<br>
Detailed Description<br>
A fragrance dispenser can be provided for dispensing fragrance onto<br>
fabric during a drying cycle in a dryer to impart a residual fragrance to the fabric. The<br>
phrase "residual fragrance" refers to a fragrance that can be detected on the fabric at<br>
least 24 hours after the drying operation. For example, more than 50% of a panel of at<br>
least nine people can detect the presence of a residual fragrance on towels at least 24<br>
hours after the towels are dried in a dryer in the presence of the fragrance dispenser.<br>
The term "fabric" refers to any textile that can be processed in a dryer<br>
for the removal of water. Fabrics are often referred to as laundry in the case of<br>
industrial and domestic (or residential) laundry operations. Exemplary laundry items<br>
include towels, bed sheets, and clothing. Exemplary articles of clothing or garments<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2006/113091	PCT/US2006/011907<br>
laundered at an industrial laundering facility include robes, uniform shirts, uniform<br>
pants, executive shirts, lab coats, aprons, jackets, and shop coats. The reference to<br>
fabric includes items or articles that include fabric. Items or articles that include fabric<br>
can include athletic shoes, accessories, stuffed animals, brushes, mats, hats, gloves,<br>
outerwear, tarpaulins, tents, and curtains.<br>
The fragrance dispenser can be formulated to be used in domestic (or<br>
residential) dryers, industrial dryers, or both domestic dryers and industrial dryers. The<br>
dryers may be gas, electric, or steam powered. In general, residential dryers refer to<br>
those dryers that are typically purchased for home use. Residential dryers can be<br>
referred to as home style dryers. Industrial dryers are often used by companies in the<br>
laundry cleaning business. Domestic dryers and industrial dryers are available that<br>
operate under various conditions depending upon the model selected, the type of heat<br>
source generated, and the desired operating conditions. In general, residential dryers<br>
often achieve a drying temperature in the range of about 100° F to about 160° F, and<br>
industrial dryers often achieve a temperature in the range of about 170° F to about 240°<br>
F. It should be understood that these ranges are not necessarily strictly adhered to.<br>
Domestic dryers and industrial dryers can operate at lower temperatures or higher<br>
temperatures as desired.<br>
The fragrance dispenser can be constructed so that it resists dispensing<br>
fragrance under ambient conditions such as room temperature, dispenses fragrance<br>
during operation of the dryer once an activation temperature is achieved, and remains<br>
as a solid so that the carrier component does not transfer to the fabric under drying<br>
conditions. The fragrance dispenser can be provided so that it operates under the<br>
conditions encountered in a domestic dryer, under the conditions encountered in an<br>
industrial dryer, or under conditions encountered in both a domestic dryer and an<br>
industrial dryer. For example, the fragrance dispenser can be provided so that it<br>
operates to dispense a desired dose when provided in a dryer operating at a dryer<br>
temperature of at least about 100°F. Furthermore, the fragrance dispenser can be<br>
provided so that it dispenses a fragrance when provided in a dryer at a drying<br>
temperature of at least about 170°F. The fragrance dispenser can be constructed so that<br>
it does not dispense a dose when provided in a dryer during a dryer operation at a dryer<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2006/113091	PCT/US2006/011907<br>
temperature of less than 100°F or less than 170°F. Accordingly, the fragrance<br>
dispenser can be constructed for use in a domestic dryer so that it dispenses a dose<br>
during a drying cycle at a drying temperature in the range of about 100°F to about<br>
160°F, and can be constructed so that it dispenses a dose during a drying cycle in an<br>
industrial dryer during a drying cycle at a drying temperature of about 170°F to about<br>
240°F, or the fragrance dispenser can be constructed so that it operates to dispense a<br>
dose during a drying cycle during operation of both a domestic dryer and an industrial<br>
dryer.<br>
The fragrance dispenser includes at least two components. The first<br>
component can be referred to as the carrier component and the second component can<br>
be referred to as the fragrance component. The carrier component can be responsible<br>
for holding the fragrance component in a solid form and allowing a controlled release<br>
of the fragrance component once the environment containing the solid form has reached<br>
an activation temperature. The carrier component can be selected to provide<br>
containment and controlled release of the fragrance component, and so that the carrier<br>
component does not transfer to fabrics in the dryer during operation of the dryer. The<br>
fragrance component can be selected so that it dispenses from the fragrance dispenser<br>
at the activation temperature to impart a residual fragrance on fabric subjected to drying<br>
in the dryer. In addition, the fragrance component can be selected so that a desired<br>
amount or dose of the fragrance component can be released from the fragrance<br>
dispenser during a drying cycle. If all or almost all of the fragrance component<br>
dispenses during a single drying cycle, the fragrance dispenser may be useful as a<br>
single use fragrance dispenser. In addition, the fragrance dispenser can be useful as a<br>
single use fragrance dispenser if a dose is dispensed during a single drying cycle and<br>
subsequent use of the fragrance dispenser during a drying cycle does not amount to<br>
dispensing of a dose of the fragrance component. If the fragrance dispenser releases a<br>
dose of the fragrance component during multiple drying cycles, the fragrance dispenser<br>
can be characterized as a multiple use fragrance dispenser.<br>
The carrier component and the fragrance component can be selected so<br>
that they are compatible. The term "compatible" refers to the lack of a reaction or other<br>
type of deleterious interaction between the carrier component and the fragrance<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2006/113091	PCT/US2006/011907<br>
component that may impair the carrier component or the fragrance component, and<br>
refers to a level of mixing of the carrier component and the fragrance component so<br>
that the fragrance component can be released from the fragrance dispenser to provide a<br>
desired dose of the fragrance dispenser once the activation temperature is reached<br>
during a drying cycle in a laundry dryer. The term "compatible" refers to an ability of<br>
the fragrance component to migrate through the fragrance dispenser over time to<br>
provide a controlled release of the fragrance component so that the fragrance dispenser<br>
imparts a desired level of residual fragrance to fabric dried in the dryer, even after<br>
multiple cycles.<br>
The carrier component of the fragrance dispenser can be selected so that<br>
the fragrance dispenser does not melt during operating conditions of the dryer into<br>
which the fragrance dispenser is placed. In reference to the fragrance dispenser, the<br>
term "melt" or "melting" refers to the carrier component transferring to the fabric<br>
during a drying operation. Transfer of the carrier component onto the fabric during a<br>
drying operation can result in damage to the fabric. When provided for use in a<br>
domestic dryer, the carrier component can be selected so that it does not flow onto the<br>
fabric being dried in the domestic dryer at temperatures up to about 170°F. In addition,<br>
the carrier component can be selected so that when the fragrance dispenser is placed in<br>
an industrial dryer at a drying temperature up to about 240°F, the carrier component<br>
does not flow onto the fabric being dried in the industrial dryer. It should be<br>
understood that the reference to "drying temperature" refers to the temperature achieved<br>
within the dryer during a drying cycle.<br>
The carrier component can be selected so that the fragrance dispenser<br>
releases a desired amount of the fragrance component during a drying cycle. For a<br>
single use application, the carrier component can be selected so that essentially all of<br>
the fragrance component is released from the fragrance dispenser. In the case of a<br>
multiple use fragrance dispenser, the carrier component can be selected so that a<br>
desired amount or dose of the fragrance component is released during each drying cycle<br>
during the useful life of the fragrance dispenser. It should be understood that at some<br>
point, the fragrance dispenser will stop releasing a desired amount or dose of fragrance<br>
component onto the laundry. Once the fragrance dispenser stops releasing a desired<br>
5<br><br>
WO 2006/113091	PCT/US2006/011907<br>
amount or dose of the fragrance component onto the laundry, the fragrance dispenser<br>
can be considered exhausted and can be replaced with a new fragrance dispenser. The<br>
exhausted fragrance dispenser can be discarded. The desired amount of the fragrance<br>
component that results in a residual fragrance can be referred to as a dose. For a<br>
multiple use fragrance dispenser, it is desirable for the dispenser to provide a fragrance<br>
dose during at least 10 drying cycle. The fragrance dispenser can be provided so that it<br>
doses fragrance during at least about 20 cycles in a laundry dryer, and can be provided<br>
so that it doses fragrance during at least about 50 cycles in a laundry dryer.<br>
The dose of a fragrance component refers to an amount and type of<br>
fragrance that provides a residual fragrance to the textiles dried that can be detected on<br>
the fabric at least 24 hours after the drying operation. For example, more than 50% of a<br>
panel of at least nine people can detect the presence of a fragrance on towels at least 24<br>
hours after the towels are dried in a dryer in the presence of the fragrance dispenser<br>
wherein the fragrance dispenser is dispensing a desired amount or dose of the fragrance<br>
component. Preferably, the fragrance dispenser can satisfy a panel test where at least<br>
six of nine panelists correctly identify the towel, from a group of three towels, that is<br>
different. Either one towel or two towels of the three towels are dried in a dryer in the<br>
presence of the fragrance dispenser at least 24 hours earlier. The other towel or towels<br>
are not dried in the presence of a fragrance dispenser. The panelists are asked to<br>
identify the towel that is different from the other two towels without being told that the<br>
difference relates to fragrance. The panelists that can detect the presence of residual<br>
fragrance either select the towel that has no residual fragrance if the other two towels<br>
have a residual fragrance or select the towel that has the residual fragrance is the two<br>
other towels do not have residual fragrance. This type of panel test can be referred to<br>
as a "triangle test." It should be understood that the panelists are individuals not<br>
suffering from an impairment of olfactory sense from, for example, illness or activity<br>
that may limit one's ability to detect fragrance (e.g., smoking or exposure to certain<br>
chemicals).<br>
The carrier component of the fragrance dispenser can be any polymer<br>
component that mixes with the fragrance component to provide a solid fragrance<br>
dispenser that releases the fragrance component over time as a result of heating the<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2006/113091	PCT/US2006/011907<br>
fragrance dispenser to an activating temperature. The selection of the carrier<br>
component may depend on the selection of the fragrance component. That is, various<br>
fragrance components may be more compatible or suitable for use with certain types of<br>
carrier components. Exemplary polymers that can be used as the carrier component<br>
include polyamides, polyolefins, functionalized polyolefins, polyacrylates,<br>
polysaccharides, or mixtures thereof. Exemplary polyamides include fatty polyamides<br>
such as those available under the name VERSALON from General Mills and<br>
VERSAMTD from Cognis, ester terminated polyamides such as those available under<br>
the names UNICLEAR 100 and UNICLEAR 100V from Arizona Chemical,<br>
polyolefins such as polyethylene, polypropylene, or mixtures of polyethylene and<br>
polypropylene, functionalized polyolefins such as polyvinyl chloride, polyvinyl acetate,<br>
or polyvinyl alcohol, polyacrylates such as polymethacrylate, and polysaccharides such<br>
as starches. Exemplary polymers that can be used as the carrier component of the<br>
fragrance dispenser include olefinic polymers such as olefinic thermoplastic polymers.<br>
Exemplary olefinic thermoplastic polymers include polyethylene and polypropylene. It<br>
is expected that several of the polymers available from RTP Company of Winona,<br>
Minnesota.<br>
The carrier component of the fragrance dispenser can be provided in an<br>
amount so that the fragrance dispenser remain as a solid during use of the fragrance<br>
dispenser and so that the carrier component does not transfer to the fabric or laundry<br>
dried in the dryer. It should be understood that the reference to a solid form means that<br>
the fragrance dispenser does not melt or flow onto fabric or laundry dried in the dryer.<br>
The fragrance dispenser can be provided in forms that may be considered soft, rubbery,<br>
flexible, hard, rigid, etc. The fragrance dispenser can include the carrier component in<br>
an amount sufficient so that the fragrance dispenser remains as a solid and the carrier<br>
component does not flow onto the fabric during a drying operation. By way of<br>
example, the fragrance dispenser can include the carrier component in an amount of<br>
about 30 wt.% to about 90 wt.%, about 40 wt.% to about 80 wt.%, or about 50 wt.% to<br>
about 70 wt.%.<br>
The fragrance component that can be used in the fragrance dispenser<br>
includes those fragrances that are compatible with the carrier component. In the case of<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2006/113091	PCT/US2006/011907<br>
a single use fragrance dispenser, it is desirable for the fragrance component to remain<br>
in the fragrance dispenser until the fragrance dispenser is placed within a dryer and<br>
achieves the activation temperature that causes the fragrance component to transfer<br>
from the fragrance dispenser to the laundry. In the case of a multiple use fragrance<br>
dispenser, it is desirable for the fragrance component to be sufficiently compatible with<br>
the polymer component so that a dose of fragrance is dispensed from the fragrance<br>
dispenser during each of the drying cycles in which the fragrance dispenser is used.<br>
The fragrance component can include volatile components and mixtures<br>
of volatile components. In general, the fragrance component can include any fragrance<br>
that is compatible with the carrier component and releases from the fragrance dispenser<br>
during operation of a dryer to impart a residual fragrance to the fabric dried in the dryer<br>
in the presence of the fragrance dispenser. Exemplary volatile components include<br>
esters, ethers, aldehydes, alcohols, nitriles, unsaturated hydrocarbons (e.g., terpenes),<br>
etc. The fragrance component can be provided having various scents including lemon,<br>
lime, orange, and musk.<br>
The fragrance component is responsible for imparting a desired smell to<br>
the textiles or laundry. The fragrance may be any fragrant substance or mixture of<br>
substances, including natural and synthetic substances that provide a favorable aroma.<br>
In addition, the fragrance may contain auxiliary materials such as fixatives, extenders,<br>
stabilizers, and solvents. Examples of suitable fragrances include, but are not limited<br>
to, silicon oils, essential oils, absolutes, resinoids, resins, and synthetic perfume<br>
components such as hydrocarbons, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, ethers, acids, esters,<br>
acetals, ketals, nitrites, including saturated and unsaturated compounds, aliphatic,<br>
carbocyclic and heterocyclic compounds. Additional examples of the fragrances<br>
include geraniol, geranyl acetate, linalool, linaly acetate, tetrahydrolinalool, citronellol,<br>
citronellyl acetate, dihydromyrcenol, dihydromyrcenyl acetate, tetrahydromyrcenol,<br>
terpineol, terpinyl acetate, nopol, nopyl acetate, 2-phenylethanol, 2-phenyl -ethyl<br>

It should be recognized that certain fragrances may include additional<br>
components that function as, for example, carriers, diluents, stabilizers, etc. Exemplary<br>
additional components include glycols and vegetable oils. The reference to the<br>
fragrance component includes the fragrance as well as any additional component<br>
combined with the fragrance to provide a beneficial property such as stability,<br>
viscosity, etc.<br>
Examples of suitable fragrances, or perfumes, are provided in U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,234,610, which is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
The fragrance dispenser can include as much of the fragrance<br>
component as desired to achieve a fragrance dispenser that provides the desired dose<br>
during each drying cycle in which the fragrance dispenser is used and provides the<br>
fabric dried in the presence of the fragrance dispenser with a residual fragrance. In<br>
general, it may be desirable to maximize the amount of the fragrance component in the<br>
fragrance dispenser to prolong the useful life of the fragrance dispenser. In addition,<br>
too much of the fragrance component in the fragrance dispenser may cause the<br>
fragrance dispenser to lose its desired release properties or may cause the fragrance<br>
dispenser to dispense the carrier component onto fabric during a drying cycle. By way<br>
of example, the fragrance dispenser can include about 10 wt.% to about 70 wt.% of the<br>
9<br><br>
WO 2006/113091	PCT/US2006/011907<br>
fragrance component. In addition, the fragrance dispenser can include about 20 wt.%<br>
to about 60 wt.% of the fragrance component. Furthermore, the fragrance dispenser<br>
can include about 30 wt.% to about 50 wt.% of the fragrance component.<br>
It should be understood that certain carrier components and certain<br>
fragrance components may not be compatible. There may exist some level or degree of<br>
incompatibility between a particular carrier component and a particular fragrance<br>
component. That is, all possible carrier components may not be compatible with all<br>
possible fragrance components. One skilled in the art would understand how to select<br>
the carrier component and the fragrance component to provide a fragrance dispenser<br>
that dispenses a desired amount or dose of the fragrance component to fabric dried in a<br>
dryer to impart a residual fragrance.<br>
The carrier component and the fragrance component can be selected so<br>
that the fragrance dispenser resists dispensing fragrance at room temperature and<br>
provides for the dispensing of a desired amount of fragrance to impart a residual<br>
fragrance to the fabric as a result of a drying cycle in a laundry dryer once an activation<br>
temperature is achieved. While the fragrance dispenser can be characterized as<br>
resisting the dispense of fragrance at room temperature, it is expected that some amount<br>
of fragrance can be dispensed at room temperature. For a given fragrance dispenser,<br>
the amount of the fragrance component dispensed at room temperature can be<br>
characterized by a release rate "x" (mass per unit time). Room temperature is about 70°<br>
F to about 75° F. When the fragrance dispenser is placed in a laundry dryer and<br>
allowed to proceed during a drying cycle, the fragrance dispenser can dispense the<br>
fragrance component at a rate of at least about 5x. This characterization refers to an<br>
amount released during the drying cycle that is 5 times greater than the amount released<br>
at room temperature. Preferably, the amount released is at least 10 times, more<br>
preferably at least about 50 times, and even more preferably at least about 100 times<br>
greater than the amount released at room temperature. It should be understood that a<br>
fragrance dispenser intended for home style dryers will provide these dispensing rates<br>
at a use temperature (temperature within a dryer) of at least about 100° F, and the<br>
fragrance dispenser for use in industrial laundry dryers will achieve this dispensing rate<br>
at a use temperature of at least about 170" F.<br>

WO 2006/113091	PCT/US2006/011907<br>
The fragrance dispenser can be provided in various shapes and sizes.<br>
The size of the fragrance dispenser can be sufficiently large so that it does not fall<br>
through the vent holes provided in a laundry dryer. In the case of a home style laundry<br>
dryer, it is expected that the fragrance dispenser will have a size of at least about 1 inch<br>
diameter. For a single use fragrance dispenser, the fragrance dispenser can have a size<br>
that allows it to be conveniently placed in a dryer and so that the desired amount of<br>
fragrance can be released from the fragrance dispenser during a drying cycle. A single<br>
use fragrance dispenser can have a size of at least about 2 grams. A single use<br>
fragrance dispenser can have a size of less than about 10 grams. A multiple use<br>
fragrance dispenser can have a size that is sufficient to allow a desired dose of<br>
fragrance to be released from the fragrance dispenser during multiple cycles in a<br>
laundry dryer. A fragrance dispenser that can achieve multiple dispensing of a desired<br>
dose to laundry during a drying cycle can have a size of at least about 10 grams, or a<br>
size of at least about 20 grams. It is generally desirable that the laundry dispenser is not<br>
too large and can be easily manipulated and does not cause a disruption during the<br>
drying operation. Accordingly, the fragrance dispenser can have a size of less than<br>
about 500 grams.<br>
The fragrance dispenser can be provided so that it is free flowing within<br>
the dryer or mounted within the dryer. In the situation where the fragrance dispenser is<br>
free flowing, it can be tossed into the dryer with the laundry and allowed to mix with<br>
the laundry. In the case where the fragrance dispenser is mounted within the dryer, it<br>
can be placed on an interior surface of the dryer. The interior surface can be a fin of the<br>
dryer or it can be some other wall surface such as, for example, the door, an end wall, a<br>
glass window, a part of the drum that rotates, etc. The fragrance dispenser can be<br>
provided with a substrate that attaches to a cradle attached to an interior surface within<br>
the dryer. Exemplary cradles that attach to an interior surface within a dryer are<br>
disclosed in, for example, U.S. Patent No. 6,779,740 to Lentsch et al.; U.S. Patent<br>
Application Publication No. US 2003/0192197 to Griese et al.; U.S. Patent Application<br>
Publication No. US 2004/0089731 to Griese et al.; U.S. Patent Application Publication<br>
No. US 2004/0159717 to Griese et al.; U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US<br>
2004/0159718 to Griese et al.; and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US<br>

WO 2006/113091	PCT/US2006/011907<br>
2005/0045736. The disclosure of each of these publications is incorporated herein by<br>
reference in its entirety.<br>
The fragrance dispenser can be formulated so that a desirable amount of<br>
the fragrance component is provided in the fragrance dispenser. Because the fragrance<br>
component can be relatively volatile, it may be desirable to formulate the fragrance<br>
dispenser under conditions that reduce the extent of loss of the fragrance component.<br>
Exemplary solidification techniques for formulating the fragrance dispenser include<br>
polymerizing and crosslinking the carrier component to form a solid. For example,<br>
monomer components can be polymerized. The polymerization can be initiated by a<br>
chemical initiator or a photo initiator. Crosslinking of oligomers or polymers can result<br>
in solidification. The composition can be extruded to a desired shape, extruded into a<br>
mold, or cast into a mold. The mold can be provided having a desired shape.<br>
The fragrance dispenser can be provided so that it does not include other<br>
laundry conditioners such as softening agents, anti-static agents, anti-wrinkle agents,<br>
and color protection agents. To the extent the fragrance dispenser may include<br>
components that can be considered "other laundry conditioners" it should be<br>
understood that those components can be excluded to an extent so that their effect as<br>
laundry conditioners is not achieved over the life of the fragrance dispenser.<br>
Preferably, the amounts of other "laundry conditioners" can be controlled to an extent<br>
that the laundry conditioners do not provide laundry conditioning effect after a single<br>
use or cycle of the fragrance dispenser. That is, if a component that can be<br>
characterized as a softening agent is incorporated into the fragrance dispenser, the<br>
amount of the softening agent should be sufficiently low so that the fragrance dispenser<br>
does not impart a softening effect to laundry dried in the presence of the fragrance<br>
dispenser after the first use or cycle of the fragrance dispenser. In addition, the<br>
fragrance dispenser can exclude an amount of the "other laundry conditioners" in<br>
amounts above their effective amounts for imparting their properties to laundry.<br>
The above specification provides a complete description of the<br>
manufacture and use of the invention. Since many embodiments of the invention can<br>
be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, the invention<br>
resides in the claims hereinafter appended.<br>
