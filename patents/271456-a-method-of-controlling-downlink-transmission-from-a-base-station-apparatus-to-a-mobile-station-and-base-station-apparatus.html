				<td>TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
DOWNLINK MIMO TRANSMISSION CONTROL METHOD AND BASE STATION APPARATUS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention generally relates to the field of wireless communications and specifically relates to techniques for implementing an efficient combination of various MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) transmission control techniques and transmission channels, taking into account the state of each physical channel in downlink.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
HSDPA (High Speed Downlink Packet Access), which has been standardized by 3GPP, provides a maximum transmission speed of 14.4 Mbps, leading to a gradual introduction of high speed and large capacity mobile communications. However, widespread use of mobile terminals including mobile phones and of the Internet, as well as an increase in variety and sophistication of the content is leading to demands for increased capacity and frequency utilization and optimized IP traffic.<br>
LTE (Long Term Evolution) , which is now being put into active use, assumes a maximum downlink transmission speed of 100 Mbps . Moreover, optimization is being demanded for both a low-speed moving terminal and a high-speed moving terminal.<br>
With MIMO transmission, different signals are transmitted over parallel transmission paths formed by multiple inputs (transmit antennas) and multiple outputs (receive antennas) (MIMO multiplexing). This technique is considered likely to become a mandatory technique for the LTE since speed can be increased in proportion to the number of the parallel transmission paths even though the same frequency is used.<br>
As a wireless access scheme, OFDM (orthogonal<br><br>
frequency division multiplexing) is suitable for high-speed transmission at the speed of over several tens of Mbps. In the OFDM, which utilizes orthogonality of frequencies, sub-carrier spectra are arranged in high density so that they overlap one another, increasing the frequency utilization. In a transmission using n sub-carriers, as a signal is divided over the multiple sub-carriers, the symbol length becomes n times relative to a system which sends a signal in one carrier.<br>
Another technique is being proposed such that, in an MIMO-OFDM transmission scheme, which spatially multiplexes OFDM signals, phase-hopping transmit diversity is performed, which applies a different phase rotation in each sub-carrier and transmit antenna such that the transmit signals are orthogonal to one another when received, increasing the transmission rate in proportion to an increase in the number of transmit antennas due to the spatial multiplexing (e.g., see Patent document 1).<br>
Patent document 1:<br>
JP2006-081131A<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[Problem(s) to be solved by the Invention]<br>
As described above, various transmission techniques have been proposed for higher-speed and larger-capacity communications. However, no method has yet been proposed which takes into account basic techniques such as scheduling, and the state of physical channels to be transmitted to efficiently combine such techniques and state. A realization of such efficient combination as described above should make it possible to communicate with a smaller number of control bits at a better characteristic level, improving the communications efficiency.<br>
The present invention aims to improve the communications efficiency of an overall system by combining optimal MIMO transmission control techniques while taking into account the state of the physical<br><br>
channels to be transmitted. [Means for solving the Problem]<br>
In order to solve the problem as described above,<br>
(1)	Open loop-type MIMO diversity is used for<br>
common control channels (a broadcast channel, a paging<br>
channel, a synchronization channel, etc.), an MBMS<br>
(Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service) channel, and a<br>
Layer 1/Layer 2 (L1/L2) control channel, while closed loop-type MIMO multiplexing/MIMO diversity are used for shared data channels to be scheduled; and<br>
(2)	for the shared data channels, a user is<br>
categorized as a localized-transmission type user, to<br>
which contiguous sub-carriers are allocated as one block,<br>
or as a distributed-transmission type user, to which<br>
sub-carriers are allocated in a manner distributed over<br>
a whole bandwidth, so that how to control the closed<br>
loop-type MIMO multiplexing/diversity is varied according<br>
to the user type.<br>
More specifically, in a first aspect of the present invention, in a method of controlling downlink transmission from a base station having multiple antennas to a mobile station having multiple antennas,<br>
(a)	open loop-type MIMO diversity is applied to<br>
a common control channel, an MBMS channel, and an L1/L2<br>
control channel; and<br>
(b)	closed loop-type MIMO multiplexing and/or<br>
MIMO diversity is applied to a shared data channel.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the MIMO multiplexing includes multiplying a pre-encoding vector with a transmit signal. For a localized-transmission type user, to which a resource block (RB) including multiple contiguous sub-carriers is allocated when transmitting a shared data channel, the number of streams in the MIMO multiplexing and a pre-encoding vector for each stream are controlled.<br>
In this case, when transmitting the shared data channel, multi-user MIMO, which performs spatial multiplexing using multiple streams in the MIMO<br><br>
multiplexing, may be applied.<br>
Moreover, the MIMO multiplexing includes multiplying a pre-encoding vector with a transmit signal. For a distributed-transmission type user, to which sub-carriers are allocated over the whole bandwidth when transmitting the shared data channel, the number of streams in the MIMO multiplexing is controlled based on the average channel state over the whole bandwidth, where the pre-encoding vector per stream is a fixed value.<br>
In this case, the pre-encoding vector per stream makes up a set of a number of fixed-value vectors, which number corresponds to the number of antennas. The fixed-value vectors may be switched within a stream according to a predetermined pattern.<br>
Moreover, for the distributed transmission-type user, to which the sub-carriers are allocated over the bandwidth when transmitting the shared data channel, the number of streams in the MIMO multiplexing may be controlled based on the average channel state of the whole bandwidth, with open loop-type MIMO diversity, which performs block encoding, being used together with MIMO multiplexing if the number of streams is less than the number of antennas.<br>
In another embodiment, the L1/L2 control channel is divided into two encoding blocks to encode the divided channel, where a first of the encoding blocks includes allocated-resource block information and the number-of-streams information, and a second of the encoding blocks includes pre-encoding vectors used per stream in the MIMO multiplexing.<br>
In this case, the mobile station, upon receiving the L1/L2 control channel, first decodes the first encoding block to extract the number of streams, and then decodes the second encoding block based on the-number-of-streams information.<br>
Moreover, the L1/L2 control channel may be divided into two encoding blocks with the first encoding block<br><br>
including allocated resource block information, and the second encoding block including pre-encoding information used per stream in MIMO multiplexing.<br>
In this case, the information includes an MIMO mode indicating whether the MIMO scheme is a single-user MIMO scheme or a multi-user MIMO scheme, the number-of-streams information, and information indicating whether the user is a localized-transmission type user to which a resource block including multiple contiguous sub-carriers is allocated, or a distributed-transmission type user to which sub-carriers are allocated over the whole bandwidth.<br>
In this case, the mobile station, upon receiving the L1/L2 control channel, first decodes the first encoding block, and then the second encoding block based on the number-of-streams information, which information is reported using a high-layer signal.<br>
According to a second aspect of the present invention, a base station apparatus includes:<br>
(a)	multiple antennas;<br>
(b)	a scheduler which allocates, to transmit data to multiple users, a radio resource based on the channel state fed back from a mobile station to schedule transmission;<br>
(c)	a serial/parallel converter which converts a number of streams into the transmit data based on stream information fed back from the mobile station, the number corresponding to a number up to the number of antennas; and<br>
(d)	a pre-encoding processor which applies<br>
pre-encoding to each of the streams, wherein the<br>
pre-encoded transmit data is transmitted from the multiple<br>
antennas.<br>
In a preferable embodiment, a pre-encoding processor applies a pre-encoding vector, which is fed back from the mobile station, to each stream of a transmit signal for a user to which a resource block including multiple<br><br>
contiguous sub-carriers is allocated by the scheduler. In another embodiment, a pre-encoding processor, which includes a fixed pre-encoding weight setting unit, applies a predetermined pre-encoding vector to each stream of a transmit signal for a user to which are allocated, by the scheduler as a resource block, sub-carriers over the whole bandwidth.<br>
[Advantage of the Invention]<br>
The present invention makes it possible to improve the downlink communications efficiency.<br>

[Best Mode of Carrying Out the Invention]<br>
A description is given below with regard to preferred embodiments of the present invention, with reference to the drawings. In the embodiments, optimal combinations of MIMO transmission control schemes according to the characteristic/state of physical channels to be transmitted are described in detail. The embodiments assume schemes for spatially multiplexing and transmitting OFDM signals using MIMO transmission, so that the techniques are explained first with reference to FIGS. 1 through 7.<br>
FIGS. 1A and IB are diagrams for explaining OFDM diversity according to the embodiments. FIG. 1A shows frequency diversity in which sub-carriers allocated to one user are spread over the whole bandwidth to obtain a diversity effect, while FIG. 1B shows multi-user diversity in which each user is allocated a resource block with a channel state which is best for the user.<br>
The method in FIG. 1A is suitable for a user which<br>
wishes to reduce the feedback load of a channel from a<br>
mobile station (UE) to a base station, for example, a user<br>
which transmits a small amount of data such as in VoIP<br>
(voice over IP) , or a user which has a difficulty following<br><br>
the channel state variation (fading variation)„ Such user as described above is called a distributed-transmission type user.<br>
The method in FIG. 1B is such that multiple contiguous sub-carriers in a portion with the best channel state are allocated as a resource block based on feedback information from each user. A user which is allocated a resource according to such frequency scheduling as described above is called a localized-transmission type user.<br>
FIG. 2 is a schematic drawing of an OFDM-based downlink wireless access. OFDM, in which a guard interval (GI) is inserted between effective symbol intervals, is resistant to inter-symbol interference, and multi-path interference. Moreover, OFDM, which is highly compatible with MIMO multiplexing and MIMO diversity, makes it possible to receive multicast/broadcast (MBMS) signals at high receive quality by soft combining, which utilize the delay within a guard interval range. In FIG. 2, resources are allocated to the localized and distributed transmission-type users in frequency and time directions.<br>
FIG. 3 is a schematic drawing for explaining MIMO multiplexing. In the MIMO multiplexing, multiple different data streams are spatially multiplexed using multiple transmit antennas arranged at intervals, and multiple receive antennas arranged at intervals. Here multiple sequences of data transmitted in the same frequency and time slot are spatially multiplexed, so that data rate (frequency utilization) improves according to the number of transmit (receive) antennas. MIMO multiplexing has an advantage that the UE peak-user throughput can be improved for the downlink, especially when the channel state is good.<br>
FIG. 4 is a drawing for explaining MIMO multiplexing pre-encoding according to the present embodiment. The pre-encoding makes it possible to form directional beams according to instantaneous fading<br><br>
variations. In other words, a beam-forming gain may be obtained. As shown in FIG. 4, data sets may be sent to multiple users using respectively different directional beams to realize multi-user MIMO, where multiple different data stream signals may be transmitted to the same user using different directional beams.<br>
In order to perform pre-encoding, it is necessary for the pre-encoding vectors or fading variations to be rapidly fed back from a UE (mobile station) . In the example in FIG. 4, feedback from the UE 1 is multiplied with each antenna transmit signal of the UE 1 using the pre-encoding vector 1 for transmit signal 1 destined for the UE 1. Similarly, feedback from the UE 2 is multiplied with each antenna transmit signal of the UE 2 using the pre-encoding vector 2 for transmit signal 2 destined for the UE 2. Such method as described above makes it possible to transmit directional beams according to fading variations, which change every moment.<br>
FIG. 5 is a drawing for explaining MIMO multiplexing rank adaptation (mode selection) according to the present embodiment. When a large number of streams are transmitted to a UE in a poor channel state, a packet error occurs. Then, using the rank adaptation, the number of streams is controlled according to the channel state, including receive signal power to interference signal power (SIR) and fading correlation. When the number of streams becomes 1, representing that one stream is transmitted from multiple antennas, this mode becomes the same as MIMO transmit diversity.<br>
In the example in FIG. 5, 4-stream transmission is conducted for the UE arranged in the vicinity of the base station as the SIR is good. For the UE arranged near the middle of a cell, a 2-stream transmission is conducted. For the UE arranged at the end of the cell, the SIR deteriorates, so that 1-stream transmission is conducted.<br>
FIG. 6 is a drawing for explaining MIMO diversity according to the present embodiment. In the MIMO diversity,<br><br>
information bits are channel encoded and data modulated, after which space time block encoding (STBC) is performed, generating and transmitting a number of encoded data sequences, which number corresponds to the number of antennas. In other words, the same transmit signal is encoded with different codes. At the receiver, after STBC decoding is performed at each antenna, antenna diversity reception is performed using maximal ratio combining (MRC).<br>
In the example in FIG. 6, information bits are STBC encoded into four transmit sequences, which are simultaneously transmitted to improve the diversity gain. Advantageously, the MIMO diversity makes it possible to improve the quality of transmitting to the UE when the channel state is poor and the data rate is low.<br>
The MIMO diversity includes open-loop (OL) transmit diversity, which does not require feedback information from the UE, and closed-loop (CL) transmit diversity, which requires feedback information from the UE. In order to make channel estimation possible, orthogonal pilot channels are transmitted from all transmit antennas.<br>
FIG. 7 is a table showing open-loop and closed-loop MIMO diversity. As examples for the open-loop diversity, time-switched transmit diversity (TSTD) or frequency switched transmit diversity (FSTD), delay diversity (CDD) , and block encoding diversity (STBC/SFBC) may be used.<br>
TSTD is a scheme such that a base station periodically switches transmit antennas per radio slot, so that, at the same moment, transmission is conducted from only one of the antennas. In the UE, the diversity effect is obtained by alternately receiving signals which passed through different propagation paths from the two antennas . It is easy to expand this scheme to 2 or more antennas.<br>
Delay diversity is provided with the same effect as multi-path diversity by differentially transmitting<br><br>
between two antennas. The delay diversity is highly compatible with OFDM, in which a GI is inserted between symbols, allowing delayed transmission within the GI range. Moreover, the delay diversity is easy to expand to two or more antennas.<br>
In block encoding diversity, block encoding such as space time block encoding (STBC) or space frequency block encoding is performed on multiple transmit sequences to improve the diversity gain.<br>
Examples of a closed-loop (feedback-loop) mode diversity include transmit antenna switching diversity and phase diversity (TxAA).<br>
In order to achieve optimization and increased efficiency of a system that is aimed at by the present embodiment, it is important to select a MIMO diversity scheme which is appropriate in accordance with the characteristics and state of the physical channel. Therefore, in the present embodiment, the MIMO control scheme to be adaptively selected is varied according to a physical channel to be transmitted, QoS (data rate, packet error rate, delay, etc. ) , and channel state per user (receive SIR, fading correlation, etc.)<br>
FIG. 8 is a diagram showing an example of adaptive-type MIMO channel transmission according to the present embodiment. Fading correlation representing the channel state is shown on the horizontal axis, while the data rate representing QoS and the modulation/encoding scheme are shown on the vertical axis. The solid, line shows control for the shared data channel, for which the closed-loop control is suitable, while the dotted line shows control for the common control channels, for which the open-loop control is suitable.<br>
The open-loop MIMO control is suitable for transmitting the common control channels (BCH, PCH, SCH, etc.), an MBMS channel, and an L1/L2 control channel, for which the receive quality requirement is not so stringent and the rate and encoding rate of transmitting are low.<br><br>
For the shared data channel, when SIR is good and the transmission is conducted at the maximum data rate, MIMO multiplexing with the maximized number of streams is applied. With a medium-level SIR, MIMO multiplexing with a reduced number of streams is combined with the closed-loop MIMO diversity (for example, transmit-antenna switching diversity) . For a low SIR (for example, for transmitting to a UE located at a cell edge) , the closed-loop MIMO diversity is performed. As described above, this is equivalent to MIMO multiplexing using 1-stream pre-encoding.<br>
The closed-loop MIMO control is suitable for transmitting a shared-data channel to be scheduled. Proper use of the below-described closed-loop MIMO control schemes may be made according to the localized-transmission type user and the distributed-transmission type user with respect to the closed-loop control for the shared data channel.<br>
In other words, for the localized-transmission type user based on frequency scheduling, the number of streams in MIMO multiplexing (see FIG. 5), and transmit weight or pre-encoding vector per stream (see FIG. 4) are controlled based on the channel state per contiguous frequency resource block allocated. For the number of streams of 1, the transmit-weight control type closed-loop MIMO diversity is used.<br>
For the distributed transmission-type user, for which transmission is conducted over the whole bandwidth, the number of streams in MIMO multiplexing is controlled based on the average channel state of the overall bandwidth. For applying pre-encoding, the transmit weight (pre-encoding vector) per stream is a fixed value. For example, diversity effect is obtained by switching the transmit weights in a predetermined pattern in the stream. For the number of streams of 1, the switching-type open-loop MIMO diversity is used in a fixed antenna (transmit weight) pattern. When pre-encoding is not used,<br><br>
if the number of streams is less than the number of antennas, the open loop-type MIMO diversity for block encoding is also used.<br>
Moreover, multi-user MIMO, in which multiple user transmit signals are spatially multiplexed using multiple MIMO-multiplexed streams, is applied only to the localized-transmission type user based on frequency scheduling with pre-encoding. In other words, for transmitting the shared data channel, multi-user MIMO may be applied to the localized-transmission type user, in which multiple streams in MIMO multiplexing are used to spatially multiplex multiple user transmit signals.<br>
Such MIMO multiplexing schemes according to the users as described above are described in further detail with reference to FIGS. 9 through 11.<br>
FIG. 9 is a drawing illustrating MIMO multiplexing schemes for shared data channels to be transmitted to the localized-transmission type user. In FIG. 9, pre-encoding vectors determined per resource block based on feedback information from the UE are used.<br>
In this case, feedback information from the UE to the base station includes SINR per stream at each resource block, stream number used, and pre-encoding vector number per stream.<br>
Here, Wx,y, in which each vector is a pre-encoding vector of a y-th resource block of an x-th stream that is determined based on feedback information, is a set of vectors Wx,y,n for an n-th transmit antenna of a number of transmit antennas, where the number of the transmit antennas is 4. In other words,<br>
Wx,y={Wx,y,1,Wx,y,2,Wx,y,3,Wx,y,4} •<br>
When the UE is located near a base station, the pre-encoding vectors are determined per resource block using a 4-stream transmission. When the UE is not located near the base station, the pre-encoding vectors are determined per resource block using a 2-stream transmission. When the UE is located at the cell edge,<br><br>
weight-control type closed-loop MIMO diversity is used with a 1-stream transmission.<br>
In the example in FIG. 9, while different pre-coding vectors are determined per resource block, the number of bits for the control channel may be reduced by setting a restriction such that the pre-encoding vectors must be the same for multiple neighboring resource blocks. In this case, feedback information from the UE to the base station includes SINR per stream at a sub band, which sub band is a group of multiple neighboring resource blocks, stream number used, and pre-encoding vector number for each stream.<br>
FIG. 10 also shows a MIMO control scheme at the time of transmitting a shared data channel to the localized-transmission type user. However, the scheme in FIG. 10 is different from the scheme in FIG. 9 in that it uses the same pre-encoding vector for all resource blocks within a stream. The relationship between the stream number and the pre-coding vector may be predetermined on a one-on-one basis. In this case, feedback information from the UE to the base station may be only the stream number used.<br>
In the method in FIG. 10, while the control accuracy according to the channel variation of the pre-encoding vector is inferior, the number of uplink feedback bits and the number of downlink control channel bits may be reduced.<br>
FIG. 11 is a drawing illustrating MIMO multiplexing schemes for shared data channels to be transmitted to the distributed-transmission type user. Here, transmit weight (pre-encoding vector) per stream is a fixed value. In the example in FIG. 11, the transmit weights are switched in a predetermined pattern in a stream. The above-mentioned pattern is also known in advance by the UE.<br>
Information to be fed back from the UE to the base station is an average SINR per stream for the overall<br><br>
bandwidth, and the stream number used. The transmit period may differ from one control bit to another. In general, information of the stream number used (including the number of streams) may be fed back at a rate lower than that for the SINR.<br>
Here, Wx is a set of pre-encoding vectors WX, n for an n-th transmit antenna of a number of transmit antennas, where the number of base station antennas is 4. In other words, Wx={Wx,1,Wx,2,Wx,3,Wx,4} .<br>
For Wx, different value may be used for each packet in a predetermined pattern.<br>
FIG. 12 shows an example of an application to physical channels for the open-loop type MIMO diversity according to the present embodiment. While not shown in the table in FIG. 7, an open-loop MIMO diversity scheme, such that pre-encoding which varies in time in a predetermined pattern is multiplied for transmitting, is applied as Candidate 1. One reason for applying the above scheme is that it does not require, at the UE in advance, information on whether the MIMO diversity is used. Moreover, transmit power amplifiers of all base station antennas may be used, so that the scheme is more suitable than time-switched type transmit diversity (TSTD). Moreover, TSTD is applied as Candidate 2.<br>
For the broadcast channel (BCH), as Candidate 1, block encoding diversity (STBC or SFBC) is used for up to 2 antennas, and a combination of block encoding diversity and delay diversity (CDD) or time (frequency) switched transmit diversity is used for over 2 antennas. This is because the STBC/SFBC has a better characteristic than other open loop-type MIMO diversity schemes. For over 2 antennas, there are no appropriate STBC/SFBC codes, so that delay diversity schemes are combined. As Candidate 2, only the delay diversity is used. An advantage of applying only the delay diversity is that the same frame configuration as antenna transmission may be used.<br>
For the paging channel (PCH) and L1/L2 control<br><br>
channel, the same open loop MIMO diversity as the broadcast channel may be used. For soft-combining among cells (sectors) within the same base station, applying only the delay diversity is predominant.<br>
For the L1/L2 control channel, the same open loop MIMO diversity as the broadcast channel may be used for an encoding block 1 as described below. In other words, for a base station having multiple antennas, the same transmit scheme as for BCH and PCH may be used for transmitting the encoding block 1 (allocated RB information (and the number-of-streams information)). Moreover, for the below-described encoding block 2 (pre-encoding information, MCS information, ARQ information, UE ID or CRC) , the same open-loop MIMO diversity as the broadcast channel may be used. In addition, a MIMO diversity scheme such that a pre-encoding vector is multiplied for transmitting may also be used. For encoding block 2, when transmitting a pre-encoded pilot channel, a pre-encoding vector is multiplied for transmitting.<br>
For transmitting the MBMS channel using the open-loop MIMO diversity, the delay diversity (including cyclic delay diversity (CDD) ) is applied. The MBMS provides for synchronously transmitting with other cells to obtain delay diversity, so that an already-high frequency diversity is obtained. Therefore, with STBC, the effect of an increased overhead due to transmitting orthogonal pilot channels necessary for STBC decoding is greater than an improvement in transmit diversity. Here, the use of the delay diversity makes it possible to reduce the overhead for the pilot for demodulating relative to the use of other methods.<br>
FIG. 13A shows a channel configuration for a downlink L1/L2 control channel that is suitable for the open-loop control. The L1/L2 control channel is transmitted from the base station to the UE in association with the shared data channel. The L1/L2 control channel<br><br>
contains the following information items:<br>
(1)	information on allocated resource-block;<br>
(2)	information on the number-of-streams;<br>
(3)	information on pre-encoding vectors used per stream for the number of streams (As shown in FIG. 11, when the relationship is predetermined on a one-on-one basis between the stream number and the pre-encoding vector, only the stream number used may be reported.);<br>
(4)	MCS (modulation scheme and encoding rate) per stream (In principle, sending is performed for the number of streams, but when using a modulation scheme and encoding rate which are common among the streams, sending is performed only once.);<br>
(5)	Information related to hybrid ARQ (In<br>
principle, sending is performed for the number of streams,<br>
but when transmitting the same encoding block signal for<br>
the multiple streams, sending is performed only once.);<br>
and<br>
(6)	UE ID information.<br>
Of the information items as described above, information items (1) and (2) are collectively encoded (encoding block 1) . On the other hand, a CRC bit is added to information items (3) and (5) as a collection of information. The CRC bit is convolved with the IE ID information (6) to transmit the convolved result (encoding block 2) . CRC is computed for the control bits of all the encoding blocks 1 and 2.<br>
FIGS. 13A and 13B show the channel configuration and decoding method for such downlink L1/L2 control channel as described above. As shown in FIG. 13A, L1/L2 control channel is divided into two encoding blocks 1 and 2 to encode the divided blocks. The encoding block 1 includes the allocated resource block information and the number-of-streams information ((1) + (2)). The encoding block 2 includes pre-encoding information, MCS information, hybrid ARQ (HARQ) information, and a convolution of the CRC bit and the UE ID ((3) + (4) + (5)<br><br>
+ (6) x CRC) ) The encoding block 2 varies in length according to the number of streams.<br>
As shown in FIG. 13B, for decoding the L1/L2 control channel at the mobile station, the encoding block 1 is decoded to recognize the number of streams. Next, the encoding block 2 is decoded based on the information as described above. The information length of the encoding block 2 varies according to the number of streams. However, as the encoding block 1 is decoded in advance, there is no need to assume the multiple information lengths to attempt decoding the encoding block 2.<br>
Moreover, the L1/L2 control channel may be configured as per below.<br>
In this case, as shown in FIG, 14A, common user information (information indicating a MIMO mode such as multi-user or single-user) , and user-specific information (e.g., number-of-streams-information, information indicating whether it is a localized transmission or distributed transmission) are reported in advance in a high-layer control signal. Here, localized transmission is a transmitting scheme which allocates contiguous sub-carriers as one block, while distributed transmission is a transmitting scheme which spreads sub-carriers over the whole bandwidth. The transmission of the number-of-streams information may be conducted at low speed (with transmitting at a transmitting period no less than 100msec, or transmitting at the time of the start of communications), so that the number-of-streams information is transmitted using the high-layer signal, not the L1/L2 control channel.<br>
As shown in FIG. 14B, the L1/L2 control channel contains the following information:<br>
(1)	information on allocated resource-block;<br>
(2)	information on pre-encoding vectors used per stream for the number of streams (When the relationship is predetermined on a one-on-one basis between the stream number and the pre-encoding vector, only the stream number<br><br>
used may be reported.); and<br>
(3) MCS per stream (modulation scheme and encoding rate) (In principle, sending is performed for the number of streams, but when using a modulation scheme and encoding rate common among the streams, sending is performed only once.);<br>
(4)	Information related to hybrid ARQ (In<br>
principle, sending is performed for the number of streams,<br>
but when transmitting the same encoding block signal for<br>
the multiple streams, sending is performed only once.);<br>
and<br>
(5)	UE ID information.<br>
Of the information items as described above, the information item (1) is encoded (encoding block 1) . In the meantime, the information items (2) through (5) are collectively encoded (encoding block 2), where CRC bits are collectively transmitted with the information items (2) through (4), with the CRC bits convolved with the information item (5) . CRC is computed for the control bits of all the encoding blocks 1 and 2.<br>
In other words, the L1/L2 control channel is divided into two encoding blocks 1 and 2 to encode the divided blocks . The encoding block 1 includes the allocated resource block information (1). The encoding block 2 includes pre-encoding information, MCS information, hybrid ARQ (HARQ) information, and a convolution of the CRC bit and the UE ID ((2) + (3) + (4) + (5) x CRC). The encoding block 2 varies in length according to the number of streams.<br>
For decoding the L1/L2 control channel at the mobile station, the encoding block 1 is decoded, and, next, (2) through (5) are decoded based on such information as described above. The information lengths of (2) through (5) vary in length according to the number of streams. However, as the number-of-streams information is decoded in advance, there is no need to assume the multiple information lengths to attempt decoding the information<br><br>
items (2) through (5).<br>
FIG. 15 shows a transmission method of a pilot channel to be transmitted using OFDM-MIMO according to the present embodiment. In the present embodiment,<br>
(1)	a common pilot channel (pilot 1), which does not use pre-encoding transmitted from each base station antenna; and<br>
(2)	a dedicated pilot channel (pilot 2) , which has been pre-encoding within the allocated resource block in accordance with each stream transmitted from each base station antenna<br>
are transmitted.<br>
The pilot 1 (common pilot), which is transmitted to all users, is used for measuring the SINR, determining the number of streams and the pre-encoding vector, and demodulating the distributed-transmission type user at the user terminal.<br>
The pilot channel 2, which is transmitted only to the localized-transmission type user, is used for demodulating the localized-transmission type.<br>
For transmitting the Pilot 2 (dedicated pilot channel), the pre-encoding information of the encoding block 2, out of information included in the downlink L1/L2 control channel, may be omitted. For not separately transmitting the dedicated pilot channel, the channel estimation value for each pre-encoded transmit stream is estimated from the common pilot channel based on the pre-encoding information included in the downlink L1/L2 control channel. This will be explained with reference to FIG. 15.<br>
In FIG. 15, transmit data Sdata in a transmit stream 1 and a dedicated pilot signal Pdedicated in the transmit stream 1 are each weighted with a pre-encoding vector w1 for an antenna 1. The weighted data and signal are combined with a transmit signal from a stream 2 and a common pilot signal P1,common, so that the combined result is transmitted from the antenna 1. This transmit signal as described above<br><br>
undergoes a propagation-path variation H1, after which it is received at a UE receive antenna 1.<br>
The transmit data Sdata and the dedicated pilot signal Pdedicated in the transmit stream 1 are each weighted with a pre-encoding vector w2 for an antenna 2. The weighted data and signal are combined with a transmit signal from the stream 2 and a common pilot signal P2, common, so that the combined result is transmitted from the antenna 2. This transmit signal as described above undergoes a propagation-path variation H2, after which it is received at a UE receive antenna 1. The common pilots P1, common and P2, common are orthogonal to each other.<br>
A received signal Rdata for the transmit data Sdata in the transmit stream 1 is<br>
Rdata=(WlH1+W2H2) Sdata	(1), while<br>
a received signal Rpd for the dedicated pilot Pdedicated in the transmit stream 1 is<br>
Rpd=(W1H1+W2H2)Pdedicated	(2) •<br>
The dedicated pilot channel Pdedicated is known in advance at the mobile station, so that (W1H1+w2H2) is determined from the receive signal Rpd and the dedicated pilot channel Pdedicated. Then, the transmit data Sdata may be estimated using equation (1) without sending the pre-encoding information using the L1/L2 channel.<br>
In the meantime, the receive signal Rp1 for the common pilot channel P1,common is such that Rp1= (H1) P1,common and the receive signal Rp2 for the common pilot channel P2,common is such that Rp2= (H2) P2,common• Then, when the dedicated pilot channel is not sent and only the common pilot signal is sent, the receive data Sdata is estimated from pre-encoding information w1, w2 and the channel estimation values H1, H2, which are estimated from the received common pilot channel.<br>
Such configuration as described above makes it possible to save radio resources to be allocated to a localized-transmission type user.<br>
FIG. 16 is a schematic block diagram showing a<br><br>
configuration of a base station apparatus according to the present embodiment. A base station apparatus 10 has multiple antennas 29-1 and 29-2. The base station apparatus 10 includes buffers 11 set for each user, a scheduler 12 for scheduling transmission for each of the users, a serial/parallel converter (S/P) 13, channel encoders 15-1, 15-2 and data modulators (16-1, 16-2), which are set for each antenna, and a pre-encoding processor 19. Feedback information (CQI, receive SIR, etc.) from a mobile station that is demodulated at an uplink receive signal demodulator 28 is input at the scheduler 12. According to whether it is a distributed-transmission type user or a localized-transmission type user, resource allocation and transmission scheduling are performed as shown in FIG. 2, for example. Number-of-streams / the stream number are input to the S/P converters 13. The S/P converters 13 perform serial-to-parallel conversions for a number of times, the number being the number of streams. For the number of streams of 1, no serial to parallel conversion is performed.<br>
A desired pre-encoding vector from the mobile station is input to the pre-encoding processor 19, where each transmit sequence is weighted as shown in FIG. 4. For the distributed-transmission type, the pre-encoding processor 19 performs the weighting according to a predetermined pattern. For the localized transmission type, the base station eventually determines the pre-encoding vector as desired by the terminal.<br>
The data modulators (16-1, 16-2) control encoding rate and data modulation scheme based on CQI according to a transmission scheme which adaptively changes a modulation scheme and error-correction encoding rate (i.e., AMC (adaptive modulation and encoding)) according to a variation in the propagation environment.<br>
The other physical channel transmit signal generator 21 generates a transmit diversity signal which varies from one physical channel state to another.<br><br>
FIGS. 17A and 17B are drawings showing a configuration of a pre-encoding vector processor 19, and an application of pre-encoding weights on shared channels to be transmitted. A case is shown for using SCH as an example of a shared channel. In FIG. 17A, the pre-encoding processor 19 includes a duplicator 19a, a pre-encoder 19b, and a fixed pre-encoding weight setting unit 19c. The duplicator 19a duplicates, into multiple channels (two, in this example) , a shared channel which is channel encoded and data modulated. The pre-encoding unit 19b multiplies each of the duplicated channels with a pre-encoding vector.<br>
For multiplying with a weight, for a localized-transmission type user, according to the channel state, a pre-encoding vector which is fed back from the mobile station as shown in FIG. 9 is used. In the meantime, for using a pre-encoding vector which has been set in advance per stream for a localized-transmission type user as shown in FIG. 10, a fixed pre-encoding vector corresponding to each stream is set at the fixed pre-encoding weight setting unit 19c. In this case, a table (not shown) associating a stream number with a pre-encoding vector which is predetermined per stream may be maintained.<br>
Moreover, even for using a set of pre-encoding vectors that is predetermined per stream as shown in FIG. 11, the fixed pre-encoding weight setting unit 19c applies, to each stream, a corresponding set of vectors. In this case, a table (not shown) associating a stream number with a set of pre-encoding vectors (including a number of pre-encoding vectors, which number corresponds to the number of antennas) that is predetermined per stream may be maintained.<br>
FIG. 17B shows transmit diversity for a pre-encoded signal sequence. As shown in FIG. 4, both of a pre-encoding vector w1-applied signal 1 and a pre-encoding vector w2-applied signal 2 are sent to each antenna. For sending these two differently-weighted transmit channels from one antenna, different sub-frames<br><br>
within a 10 ms radio frame are used for transmission. In this way, a transmit diversity effect is obtained.<br>
Turning back to FIG. 16, the pre-encoded signal sequences are division-multiplexed to mutually orthogonal sub-carriers at OFDM multiplexing/mapping units 22-1, 22-2, and mapped onto the complex plane. The respective complex-modulated OFDM sub-carrier signals are inverse fast Fourier transformed at IFFT units 23, given a CP (cyclic prefix) at CP adders 24, converted to an RF signal at RF transmit circuits 25, amplified at power amplifiers 26, and transmitted from antennas 29 via duplexers 27.<br>
In this way, shared data channels to be scheduled are MIMO multiplexed (in the closed loop) for transmission based on feedback information. For the number of streams of 1 as found in the feedback information, MIMO transmit diversity is used.<br>
In the meantime, other physical channel (common control channel, L1/L2 control channel, MBMS channel, etc.) transmit signals are also led to a number of sequences at an other physical channel transmit signal generator 21, the number corresponding to the number of antennas, and OFDM-multiplexed and mapped. Although not specifically shown, for generating the L1/L2 control channel, the broadcast channel, and the paging channel, an STBC encoder is arranged following the channel encoder and the modulator. Moreover, as with the shared data channel, a pre-encoder is arranged after the channel encoder and the modulator in order to generate the synchronization channel. For generating the MBMS channel, a delay unit is arranged after the channel encoder and modulator.<br>
For these channels as described above, which (in an open loop) do not require feedback information from the mobile station, MIMO transmit diversity is applied.<br>
FIG. 18 is a block diagram showing a schematic configuration of a mobile station apparatus. The signals received at respective multiple antennas 39-1 and 39-2 of a mobile station apparatus 30 are each separated from a<br><br>
transmit signal at a duplexer 31, converted to a baseband signal at an RF receive circuit 32, and fast Fourier transformed at an FFT unit 34, where an estimated value which is estimated at the receive timing estimator 33 is input. A shared data channel is input to a signal detector 35. In the meantime, a downlink L1/L2 control channel which is incoming in association with the shared data channel is demodulated at a downlink L1/L2 control channel demodulator 37.<br>
Of a set of information included in the control channel, the number of streams, a modulating scheme, and a channel encoding rate are input to the signal detector 35 so as to be used for demodulating the received shared data channel. In the meantime, pre-encoding vector information is input to a channel estimator 38 using a pilot channel. The shared data channel which is detected at the signal detector 35 is decoded at a channel decoder 36, reconstructing a transmit signal.<br>
Outputs of the FFT units 34 are also input to a desired number-of-streams and stream number estimator 41 using a pilot channel, a desired pre-encoding vector estimator 42 using the pilot channel, and a CQI estimator 43 using the pilot channel. The estimated desired number of streams/stream number, desired pre-encoding vector, and CQI are reported to the base station via uplink.<br>
As described above, according to the present embodiment, a combination of appropriate MIMO transmission control schemes and transmission channels, taking into account the kind and characteristics of physical channels to be transmitted, and the radio environment, makes it possible to improve the transmission characteristics, and achieve a more efficient radio resource utilization.<br>
