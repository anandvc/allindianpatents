Method and System for Call Control<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to the mobile communications technology, and more particularly, to a method and system for call control, and a Service Control Point (SCP), a Business Operation Supporting System (BOSS).<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Along with the continuous development of the mobile communication technology, the communications between people become more and more rapid and convenient, and the number of mobile subscribers is increasing rapidly. For telecommunication developers and operators, how to determine the charging mode of various developed services has become an important issue of concern. These days, the pre-paid and post-paid charging modes are generally used in the developed mobile services.<br>
For the post-paid mode, charging is performed based on a BOSS which is also called billing system. Fig. 1 shows a schematic diagram of charging in the post-paid mode and call control in accordance with the prior arts. As shown in Fig.l, when the post-paid mode is adopted for charging, the post-paid subscriber may use a communication service before charging. Upon finishing a communication service, an exchange device such as a Mobile Switch Center (MSC)/Service Switch Point (SSP) may acquire the call duration, generate a call bill according to the call duration and send the call bill to the BOSS. The BOSS performs a charging process on the subscriber according to the received call bill.<br>
In a post-paid service, as a subscriber can use the service before charging, such problems as excessive arrears and vicious arrears of a subscriber may emerge sometimes. To avoid the problems of excessive arrears and vicious arrears of a post-paid service subscriber, the solution to such problems in the prior arts is as shown in Fig.l: The BOSS, according to the charging operations made by the BOSS itself on the subscriber, instructs a Home Location Register (HLR) to change the service attribute of the subscriber and stop the relevant voice service, data service and value-added service for the subscriber so as to implement the call control of the post-paid service subscriber, thereby avoid the problems of excessive arrears and vicious arrears by the subscriber.<br><br>
However, in the prior arts, the BOSS can perform the charging process when a communication service is finished, and then :.op the relevant services of the subscriber through the HLR according to the charging result. It is impossible, however, to timely control the call procedure of a subscriber through charging processing when a call is set up or during a call, and thus impossible to avoid the problems of excessive arrears and vicious arrears of the subscriber, thereby the benefits of the operators are harmed.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
In the prior arts, when the post-paid mode is adopted, the charging is performed by the BOSS according to the call bill after a service is finished. According to the charging result, the subsequent call control is performed, and thus the problems of excessive arrears and vicious arrears of a subscriber can not be effectively avoided. To solve these problems, a real-time control, that is, a charging evaluation and a call control based on the charging result must be performed in the call procedure of the subscriber, rather than a control after the end of the call, thereby radically avoiding problems of excessive arrears and vicious arrears of the subscriber. As the SCP can provide the real-time call control, and the BOSS can provide the charging evaluation in the case of a post-paid service, the SCP and the BOSS may be used together for the call control. Considering the characteristic, a method for call control is put forward by the present invention, which includes the following processes: an SSP or an MSC receives a call, and triggers the call at a SCP; the SCP sends an authentication request carrying a subscriber identifier of this call to a BOSS; the BOSS performs the authentication on the subscriber of the call according to the subscriber identifier and the . ubscriber information stored in the BOSS, and sends an authentication result to the SCP; the SCP controls the call according to the authentication result.<br>
The call may be initiated either by a pre-paid subscriber or by a post-paid subscriber, that is, the embodiments of the present invention may be applied either to call control of a pre-paid subscriber or to call control of a post-paid subscriber. In case of the call control of a pre-paid subscriber, various information of the subscriber is added in the existing BOSS in advance in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Fig.2 shows the basic structure of a system for call control according to an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in Fig.2, the embodiment of the present invention accordingly proposes a system. The system includes an SCP and a BOSS, in which the SCP further includes a real-time call control unit and a real-time interaction unit and the BOSS fiirther includes an authenticating and charging unit.<br>
The real-time interaction unit, on one hand, receives an authentication request carrying a subscriber identifier of a call sent by the real-time call control unit, and sends the   authentication   request   carrying  the   subscriber   identifier   of the   call   to   the<br><br>
authenticating and charging unit in the BOSS. On the other hand, the real-time interaction unit receives an authentication result sent by the authenticating and charging unit in the BOSS and sends the authentication result to the real-time call control unit in the SCP.<br>
The real-time call control unit, on one hand, receives call information submitted by a switch system and sends the authentication request carrying the subscriber identifier of the call to the real-time interaction unit in the SCP. And the SSP or the MSC is an example of the switch system, in the following description the SSP or the MSC refers to the switch system. On the other hand, the real-time call control unit receives the authentication result sent by the real-time interaction unit and controls the call according to the authentication result.<br>
The authenticating and charging unit receives the authentication request carrying the subscriber identifier of the call sent by the real-time interaction unit in the SCP, performs an authentication on this call according to the subscriber identifier of the call carried in the authentication request and the subscriber information stored in the authenticating and charging unit, and sends the authentication result to the real-time interaction unit in the SCP.<br>
Fig.3 shows a preferred structure of the system according to an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in Fig.3, in order to timely indicate the service duration and charging information of the subscriber in a call, preferably, a real-time call bill generating unit may be further included in the BOSS. The authenticating and charging unit in the BOSS is further used for sending the service duration and the charging information in the call to the real-time call bill generating unit when the call is finished. The real-time call bill generating unit is used to create the call bill of the call timely when it receives the service duration and charging information in the call.<br>
To make the objectives, technical solution and advantages of the present invention more apparent, the embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings and embodiments.<br>
Fig.4 shows a flowchart of an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in Fig.2 and 4, by using the system of the embodiment of the present invention, the method<br><br>
for call control in accordance with the embodiment of the present invention includes the following processes:<br>
Step 401: a calling subscriber initiates a call. An MSC/SSP receives a call and triggers the call to an SCP.<br>
In this process, upon receiving the call, the MSC/SSP directly triggers the call to the SCP regardless of whether the subscriber initiating the call is a pre-paid subscriber or a post-paid subscriber. In this way, it is ensured that the SCP may be used to perform a real-time call control on the call in the subsequent procedures either for a pre-paid subscriber or for a post-paid subscriber.<br>
Step 402: a real-time call control unit of the SCP receives the call, carries subscriber information of the call in an authentication request and sends the authentication request to the real-time interaction unit of the SCP. The real-time interaction unit sends the received authentication request carrying the subscriber information of this call to an authenticating and charging unit of the BOSS.<br>
The subscriber information of this call carried in the authentication request mentioned here and hereafter includes such information as the subscriber identifier of the call and etc.<br>
In this process, after the call is triggered to the SCP, the SCP sends the authentication request to the BOSS so that the BOSS could perform a real-time charging evaluation on this call in the subsequent procedures.<br>
Step 403: the authenticating and charging unit of the BOSS receives the authentication request carrying the subscriber information of this call, authenticates the subscriber according to the subscriber information of this call carried in the authentication request and the subscriber information stored in the authenticating and charging unit, and sends an authentication result to the real-time interaction unit in the SCP.<br>
Here, for a post-paid subscriber, the BOSS stored the subscriber information for authentication in itself, such as the identifier, the balance information and the payment record information of the post-paid subscriber. For a pre-paid subscriber, according to the embodiment of the present invention, the pre-paid subscriber information such as the<br><br>
identifier, the balance information and the payment record information of the pre-paid subscriber are pre-stored in the BOSS. In this vvay, in this process, the BOSS can perform an authentication process either in the case of a post-paid subscriber or in the case of a pre-paid subscriber.<br>
Fig.5 shows a flowchart of performing an authentication and obtaining an authentication result by the authenticating and charging unit in the BOSS according to an embodiment of the invention. As shown in Fig.5, the detailed implementation procedures of the above Step 403 include the following processes:<br>
Step 501: an authenticating and charging unit in the BOSS searches, from	the<br>
various subscriber information stored in the authenticating and charging unit,	for<br>
subscriber information which includes the subscriber identifier carried in	the<br>
authentication request.<br>
Step 502: the authenticating and charging unit in the BOSS determines whether the subscriber initiating the call is a pre-paid subscriber or a post-paid subscriber according to the found subscriber information. If the subscriber is a pre-paid subscriber, proceed to Step 503. If the subscriber is a post-paid subscriber, proceed to Step 504.<br>
Step 503: the authenticating and charging unit in the BOSS determines whether the subscriber initiating this call is allowed to call according to the balance information of this subscriber. If the subscriber is allowed to call, proceed to Step 505; otherwise, proceed to Step 506.<br>
Step 504: the authenticating and charging unit in the BOSS determines whether the subscriber initiating the call is allowed to call according to a payment record of this subscriber. If the subscriber is allowed to call, proceed to Step 505; otherwise, proceed to Step 506.<br>
Here, when the payment records of this subscriber indicate that this subscriber is able to pay the bill and/or has a few arrears, this subscriber is regarded to be allowed to call. If the payment records of this subscriber indicate that this subscriber has excessive arrears and/or is unable to pay the bill, this subscriber is regarded not to be allowed to call.<br><br>
In the above Steps 503 and 504, both the balance information and the payment records of this subscriber are included in the subscriber information stored in the BOSS, thus the authenticating and charging unit in the BOSS can determine whether the subscriber initiating the call is allowed to call.<br>
Step 505: the authenticating and charging unit in the BOSS sends a successful authentication message as the authentication result to a real-time interaction unit in the SCP and terminates the flow.<br>
Step 506: the authenticating and charging unit in the BOSS sends a failed authentication message as the authentication result to the real-time interaction unit in the SCP.<br>
By now, the process of performing the authentication procedure and generating the authentication result by the authenticating and charging unit in the BOSS is implemented.<br>
It should be noted that, in the process shown in Fig.5, when the authenticating and charging unit in the BOSS regards the successful authentication message as the authentication result, it generates a allowed call duration of the call for the subscriber according to the balance information (with respect to the pre-paid subscriber) or the payment records (with respect to the post-paid subscriber) of the subscriber, and carries the allowed call duration of the call in the successful authentication message sent to the real-time interaction unit in the SCP.<br>
Step 404: the real-time interaction unit in the SCP receives the authentication result and sends the authentication result to the real-time call control unit in the SCP.<br>
Step 405: the real-time call control unit in the SCP determines whether the authentication result is the successful authentication message or the failed authentication message. If the authentication result is the successful authentication message, proceed to Step 407. If the authentication result is the failed authentication message, proceed to Step 406.<br>
Step 406: the real-time call control unit in the SCP rejects the call and terminates the procedure.<br><br>
Step 407: the real-time call control unit in the SCP performs a call connecting processing and thus the calling subscriber and the called subscriber can communicate with each other.<br>
By now, the process of controlling the setting up of the subscriber's call according to the balance information or the payment records by the BOSS and the SCP is implemented, and the problems of excessive arrears and vicious arrears of the subscriber may be avoided.<br>
During the call, according to the embodiment of the present invention, the BOSS and the SCP may further control the course of the call by performing the subsequent procedures in Fig.4 according to the balance information or the payment records and the call duration to prevent the problems of excessive arrears and vicious arrears of the subscribers.<br>
During the communication between the calling subscriber and the called subscriber, the SSP/MSC periodically submits a call duration to the SCP.<br>
Step 408: the real-time call control unit in the SCP timely monitors the call, and when the call duration has reached a first allowed call duration of the call, sends the call duration information of to the real-time interaction unit in the SCP.<br>
Step 409: the real-time interaction unit in the SCP sends the call duration information to the authenticating and charging unit in the BOSS. The authenticating and charging unit in the BOSS receives the call duration information and calculates the fee corresponding to the call duration.<br>
Step 410: the authenticating and charging unit in the BOSS determines whether the subscriber is allowed to continue the communication according to the calculated fee. If the subscriber is allowed to continue the communication, proceed to Step 413; otherwise, proceed to Step 411.<br>
Here, if the subscriber of the call is a pre-paid subscriber, in this process, the authenticating and charging unit in the BOSS acquires the balance information of the current subscriber according to the calculated fee, and decides whether the current subscriber is allowed to continue the communications according to the balance of the<br><br>
current subscriber. If the subscriber of the call is a post-paid subscriber, in this process, the authenticating and charging unit in the BOSS decides whether the current subscriber is allowed to continue the communications according to the payment records and the calculated fee of the current subscriber i.e. the fee in this service.<br>
Step 411: the authenticating and charging unit in the BOSS sends a call-release instruction to the real-time interaction unit in the SCP, and the real-time interaction unit sends the call-release instruction to the real-time call control unit in the SCP.<br>
Step 412: the real-time call control unit in the SCP triggers a processing for deleting the current call. The BOSS, SCP as well as the SSP or the MSC perform the processing of releasing the current call, and the flow is terminated.<br>
Step 413: the authenticating and charging unit in the BOSS generates a second allowed call duration of the current call, and sends the second allowed call duration of the current call to the real-time interaction unit in the SCP.<br>
Here, if the subscriber of the call is a pre-paid subscriber, in this process, the authenticating and charging unit in the BOSS generates the allowed call duration of the current call according to the balance of the current subscriber. If the subscriber of this call is a post-paid subscriber, in this process, the authenticating and charging unit in the BOSS generates the allowed call duration of the current call according to the payment records of the subscriber and the calculated fee.<br>
Step 414: the real-time interaction unit in the SCP sends the second allowed call duration of the current call to the real-time call control unit in the SCP, and Step 408 is repeated.<br>
It should be noted that, when the real-time call control unit in the SCP timely monitors the call, if it receives a call-release request sent by the current subscriber through the SSP/MSC, it sends the call-release request carrying the call duration to the real-time interaction unit in the SCP. The real-time interaction unit in the SCP then sends the call-release request carrying the call duration to the BOSS. In this way, the BOSS, the SCP, and the SSP or the MSC perform the process of releasing the current call. In addition, as shown in Fig.3, upon performing the process of releasing the current call by<br><br>
the BOSS, the authenticating and charging unit in the BOSS sends the call duration information and the charging information in this call to the real-time call bill generating unit in the BOSS. The real-time call bill generating unit timely creates a call bill for the call when it receives the call duration information and the charging information in the call sent by the authenticating and charging unit.<br>
In the embodiment of the present invention, the subscriber of the call may be a calling subscriber and/or a called subscriber.<br>
In view of the above, an interface for timely interacting various information is added between the real-time interaction unit in the SCP and the authenticating and charging unit in the BOSS. The TCP/IP may be used as the bottom layer communication protocols of the interface. Moreover, the application protocols of the interface for timely interacting various information between the real-time interaction unit and the authenticating and charging unit may adopt the existing protocols or the user-defined protocols. When an existing protocol is used, the application protocol may be exemplified by a Unified Accounting Service Protocol (UASP), and the concrete implementation may be exemplified by the following: redefining an UASP interface, wherein the message format supported by the redefined UASP interface may be defined according to the message format of the existing UASP interface, such as A interface or C interface etc., or adding various messages relevant to the embodiment of the present invention in the existing UASP interface such as T interface.<br>
