ROBERT BOSCH GMBH, 70442 Stuttgart<br>
Method and appliance for controlling the drive unit of a vehicle<br>
Prior art<br>
The invention relates to a method and an appliance for controlling the drive unit of a vehicle.<br>
In modern vehicle control systems, a plurality of sometimes contradictory specifications act on the actuators present (for example drive unit, gearbox, etc.). Thus, for example, the drive unit of a vehicle may have to be controlled on the basis of the driver' s requirement, required values for external and/or internal closed-loop and open-chain control functions, such as a drive slip control system, an engine drag torque control system, a gearbox control system, a rotational speed and/or vehicle speed limitation and/or an idling speed control system. These required specifications sometimes have a contradictory character so that, because the drive unit can only adjust one of these required value specifications, it is necessary to coordinate these required value specifications, i.e. to select a required value specification which has to be realized.<br>
In association with the control of a drive unit, such coordination of different required torque values is known from DE 197 39 567 Al. In this, a required value is selected by maximum and/or minimum value selection from the torque required values., which required value is realized in the current operating condition by determining the magnitudes of the individual control parameters of the drive unit, for example, the charge, the ignition angle and/or the quantity of fuel to be injected in an internal combustion engine. Various properties with respect, for example, to the necessary dynamics of the adjustment.<br><br>
the priority, etc., can be associated with the required specifications, which properties can likewise be of contradictory nature and are not taken into account in the known coordination of the required specifications.<br>
In order also to take account of such properties, provision is made, in the previously unpublished German Patent Application 199 61 291.9 of 18.12.1999, for the properties associated with the respective required torques to be likewise coordinated in a comparable manner by means of a coordinator in order, finally, to obtain a resultant property vector, which is used as a basis for adjusting the setting parameters of the drive unit.<br>
In the known solution, the required torques are combined using their effect in maximum and minimum value selection stages and are separately coordinated for the slow (charge) control path and the rapid (ignition) control path. The result is a relatively complex structure with interfaces specially adapted to the respective embodiment of the drive unit (for example spark-ignition engine).<br>
Advantages of the invention<br>
A part of the torque structure, which is independent of the specific drive unit, is created by decoupling the coordination of the external intervention parameters and the internal intervention parameters, which part of the torque structure can be used in like manner for practically all types of drive unit, for example for diesel and petrol engines and for electric motors. It is only necessary to adapt the coordinator for the internal parameters, i.e. the parameters specific to the respective type, to the respective drive unit.<br>
The result is, therefore, an advantageously uniform interface and a more comprehensible structure.<br>
Due, furthermore, to the decoupling of the conversion   of   the   torque   resulting   from   the<br>
r<br><br>
coordination and of the property vector resulting there into setting parameters of the drive unit, the conversion of the torque is decoupled from the source of the torque requirement and degrees of freedom are gained. Thus, for example, the source cf the requirement does not decide the type ' of realization (for example by means of ignition angle). This is determined to suit the current properties, independently of the origin of the requirement which has to be realized.<br>
The specification of defined parameters selected with a view to optimizing the engine control, the structure and the interface - which parameters are transferred from the part independent of the engine to the part specific to the engine and/or vice versa, i.e. the definition of the interface between the two parts by means of the parameters to be provided by the respective part - permits further optimization and simplification of the structure and the interface. In addition, the interaction of the two parts is ensured even in the case of separate developments of the two parts.<br>
Further advantages are given in the following description of exemplary embodiments and in the dependent patent claims.<br>
Drawing<br>
The invention is explained in more detail below using the embodiments represented in the drawing. In the drawing. Fig. 1 shows a general-view circuit diagram of a control device for controlling a drive unit. Fig. 2 is a sketch of a general-view flow chart representing the torque structure, which is described in more detail below using the flow chart in Fig. 3. Figures 4 and 5 show, in a preferred exemplary embodiment, a specific configuration of the interface between the part specific to the engine and the part<br><br>
independent  of  the  engine,  with  provision  of  the parameters to be provided by the respective part.<br>
Description of exemplary embodiments<br>
Fig. 1 shows a block circuit â–  diagram of a control device for controlling a drive unit, in particular an internal combustion engine. A control unit 10 is provided which has, as components, an input circuit 14, at least one computer unit 16 and an output circuit 18. A communication system 20 connects these components for the mutual exchange of data. Input lines 22 to 26 are supplied to the input circuit 14 of the control unit 10. In a preferred exemplary embodiment, these input lines are embodied as a bus system and signals are led via them to the control unit 10. These signals represent operating parameters which have to be evaluated for the control of the drive unit. They are recorded by measurement devices 2 8 to 32. Such operating parameters are accelerator pedal position, engine rotational speed, engine load, exhaust gas composition, engine temperature, etc. The control unit 10 controls the power of the drive unit by means of the output circuit 18. In Fig. 1, this is symbolized by using the output lines 34, 36 and 38, by means of which are actuated the fuel mass to be injected, the ignition angle of the internal combustion engine and at least one throttle plate, which can be actuated electrically, for adjusting the air supply to the internal combustion engine. In addition to the input parameters outlined, further vehicle control systems are provided which transmit specified parameters, for example required torque values, to the input circuit 14. Such control systems are, for example, drive slip control systems, control systems for vehicle dynamics, gearbox control systems, engine drag torque control systems, vehicle speed control systems, vehicle speed limiting systems, etc. The air supply to the internal combustion engine, the ignition angle for the individual cylinders,  the<br><br>
fuel mass to,be injected, the injection time and/or the air/fuel ratio, etc., are adjusted via the setting paths represented. In addition to the required value specifications represented, the external required value specifications, which also include a required value specification by the driver, in the form of a driver' s requirement, and a maximum speed. limitation, internal specified parameters are present for controlling the drive unit, for example an idling control system torque change, a rotational speed limitation, which outputs a corresponding specified required parameter, a torque limitation, etc.<br>
Boundary   conditions   or   properties,   which represent  the  type  of .conversion  of  the  specified required  value  parameter,  are  associated  with  the individual specified required value parameters. In this arrangement and depending on the exemplary application, one or a plurality of properties can be associated with a specified required value parameter so that,  in an advantageous  exemplary  embodiment,  the  concept  of properties is to be understood as a property vector in which the different property parameters are entered. Properties of specified required value parameters are, for  example,  the  dynamics  necessary  during  the adjustment of the specified required value parameter, the priority of the specified required value parameter, the magnitude of the torque reserve to be set and/or the  comfort  of  the  adjustment  (for  example  change limitation).   These  properties  are  present  in  a preferred  exemplary  embodiment.  In  other  exemplary embodiments,  only  one  or  a  plurality  of  selected properties are provided.<br>
The mode of operation described is not only applicable in association with internal combustion engines but can also be applied to other drive concepts, for example electric motors. In this case, the setting parameters have to be correspondingly adapted.<br><br>
In the preferred exemplary embodiment, torque parameters are used as the specified required value parameter. In other embodiments, required values are specified - with corresponding adaptation - [lacuna] other parameters, such as power, rotational speed, etc. , which are related to output parameters of the<br>
drive unit.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a general-view flow chart of the engine control program which runs in the computer unit 16, the coordination of external parameters and the internal parameters being mutually decoupled and these coordinations being likewise decoupled from the conversion of the resultant required value and of the resultant property value into setting parameters of the drive unit.<br>
The elements shown in Fig. 2, and also correspondingly in Fig. 3, represent individual programs, program steps or program parts, whereas the connecting lines between the elements represent the flow of information.<br>
A first coordinator 100 for the external specified required torque parameters together with their property parameters, is provided in Fig. 2. The external required parameters msollexti and the property (properties) eexti associated with them are supplied to the coordinator 100. In an exemplary embodiment, the required parameters are compared with one another within, for example, the framework of minimum and maximum value selection steps. As the result, a resultant required torque value msollresext and the associated property (properties) esollresext are passed on. In other embodiments, a property is, for example, selected within the framework of a corresponding selection (for example minimum setting time) for the coordination and the required values or parameters derived from them are associated with one another to form a resultant value. In this arrangement, the external required parameters represent the intervention<br><br>
parameters which are independent of the engine, such as driver's requirement torque, the torque required by a vehicle speed control system or an adaptive vehicle speed control system. (ACC) , a vehicle speed limitation, a driving stability control system, an. engine drag torque control system and/or a drive slip control system. These specified parameters, which are independent of the engine and have to be associated with the output, represent output torques and gearbox output torques and are coordinated at this level. Driving comfort functions such as a load jolt damping function or a dashpot function are also provided in this caseâ–  Further parameters independent of the engine affect the propulsion. These include required torques, which originate from a gearbox control and support the gear-changing procedure, a required limiting value for gearbox protection and/or torque requirement values from auxiliary units such as generator, air conditioning compressor, etc. These also represent external interventions (independent of the engine) and are therefore coordinated in the coordinator 100. These parameters represent a gearbox output torque or an engine output torque, which is also the output parameter of the coordinator 100, Gearbox/converter losses, amplifications in the drive train, etc. are taken into account for the conversion of the torque values.<br>
As mentioned above, the corresponding state of affairs applies to the properties of the external parameters exti. In this arrangement, at least one defined property, for example a certain setting time, is associated with each of the required parameters mentioned above. From these properties, corresponding to the torque coordination in the coordinator 100, a resultant property vector esollresext is formed. In an exemplary embodiment, the property vector can also contain information about the current operating condition (for example accelerator pedal released) and<br><br>
externally specified limiting values. The values arising from the coordination of the external parameters in the coordinator 100 are supplied to a coordinator 104, in which the resultant external parameters are coordinated with internal parameters, i.e. parameters specific to the engine.' The interface, between the part of the engine control independent of the engine and the part of the engine control specific to the engine, is located between the coordinators 100 and 104 .<br>
The internal required parameters msollinti and einti are supplied to the coordinator 104. The parameters which depend on the engine are, in particular, required values of internal torque limitations, for example for component protection reasons, for protection against excessively weak mixture at full load, a required value for a maximum rotational speed limit, etc. In order to determine the required torque in Fig. 2, account is also taken of correction parameters (not shown) of rotational speed control systems, engine stall protection control systems, idling speed control systems, together with the engine losses, drag torques and driving comfort functions intimately associated with the engine. The output parameters of the coordinator 104 are a required value for the internal engine torque, i.e. the engine torque MSOLL generated by combustion and an associated property vector esoll.<br>
The resultant parameters output by the coordinator 104 are supplied to a converter 108, which is specific to the engine and which converts the resultant torque requirement (internal required torque and property vector) into required values for the setting paths specific to the engine. In the case of a petrol engine, for example, these are charge, ignition angle and/or injection, in the case of a diesel engine, the fuel quantity, for example, and, in the case of an electric motor,  the  current,  for  example.  In  this.<br><br>
arrangement, attention is paid to the current operating point of the engine and further boundary conditions influencing the setting paths. The conversion of the required torque and of the property vector into setting paths is, for example, carried out as described in the prior art cited at the beginning. In this, the setting path is selected which can ensure the provision of the required torque in the required time. Interventions, which act directly on a setting path, for example ignition angle interventions of an anti-jolt control system, additional charge for a torque reserve at idle, etc., are also part of the converter 108.<br>
The properties are combined above in a property vector e. Depending on the exemplary embodiment, the property vector comprises different parameters. In a preferred exemplary embodiment, which is also represented further below by Fig. 3, the property vector comprises at least one predicated torque, which normally corresponds to the unfiltered driver's requirement, but can be adapted by other interventions, in particular interventions which require a certain torque reserve, Furthermore, a setting time associated with each required torque and information on vehicle operation, for example dynamics information, rotational speed limits required, load jolt damping active bits or dashpot active bits, idling active bits, comfort settings, etc. are a constituent part of the property vector.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a flow chart showing a preferred exemplary embodiment of the torque structure presented above. In this, Figures 3a and 3b represent a preferred exemplary embodiment of the coordinator 100, Figures 3c and 3d represent an exemplary embodiment of the coordinator 104 and the converter 108. Here again, the individual elements describe programs, program parts or program steps of a program running in the microcomputer 16 of the control unit, whereas the connecting lines represent the flow of information.<br><br>
Firstly and as an example, a driver's requirement torque is determined in 200 - in accordance with a characteristic field, for example - on the basis of the engine rotational speed and the degree of actuation of an accelerator pedal by the- driver. This driver's requirement torque MSOLLFA' represents a propulsion torque. A predicated driver's requirement torque MPRADFA is correspondingly determined which, in the preferred exemplary embodiment, initially corresponds to the driver's requirement torque and, in what follows, represents the torque which, with a certain probability, has to be set subsequently. Associated with the driver's requirement torque are at least one property efa, for example a setting time in which the driver * s requirement torque has to be set, and/or the actuation condition of the pedal. The setting time is determined and output as a function of, for example, the rapidity of the pedal actuation. If the vehicle is equipped with a vehicle speed control system 202 or an adaptive vehicle speed control system, which additionally takes account of the distance to the vehicle in front, a required torque parameter MSOLLFGR, a predicated parameter MPRADFGR (which can correspond to the required torque or the steady-state torque parameter to be achieved) and associated property parameters ef gr (setting time, activation condition of the control system, etc.) are formed there. The parameters transmitted by the driver * s requirement determination 200 and by the vehicle speed control system 202 are coordinated in the coordinator 204. Thus, in the case where the vehicle speed control system is switched on, for example, the required torque and the predicated torque, which was determined by the vehicle speed control system 202, are passed on. The property vector associated with this torque, with respect to the setting time, for example, is correspondingly also passed on. If the vehicle speed control system is switched off,  the coordinator 204<br><br>
permits intervention on the basis of the corresponding driver's requirement parameters. In addition, this coordinator passes on, for example, the required driver's requirement torque plus properties, if this torque is greater than the required vehicle speed control system torque. The resultant parameters from the coordinator 204 are supplied to the driving comfort functions 206. These are understood to mean, for example, load jolt damping functions or dashpot functions, in which the driver's requirement or the specified required torque value of the vehicle speed control system is subjected to filtering in order to avoid abrupt changes in torque. This filtering is applied, in particular, to the required torque value but not to the predicated torque value. Properties can also be correspondingly filtered, for example selected properties such as the setting time information. The result, after the driving comfort precontrol system 206, is a required value MSOLLFAVT for the propulsion torque, for the predicated propulsion torque MPRADFAVT and at least one property EMSOLLFAVT associated with these parameters.<br>
The parameters quoted are relayed to a coordinator 208, to which further external intervention parameters are supplied from, for example, a driving stability control system (ESP) , an engine drag torque control system (MSR) and/or a drive slip control system (ASR) 210. This (these) function(s) likewise supplies (supply) to the coordinator 208 a required propulsion torque (for example MSOLLESP) and corresponding properties EMSOLLESP, which, in the preferred exemplary embodiment, contain, in particular, the setting time necessary for the adjustment. In addition, a vehicle speed limiting system 212 is provided which, as a function of the amount by which the vehicle exceeds a maximum vehicle speed, transmits a required torque value MSOLLVMAX for the propulsion torque together with corresponding properties EMSOLLVMAX. These parameters<br><br>
are coordinated in the coordinator 208. As represented above, the required torque values and the at least one property are associated with one another there, whereas the predicated torque, as the torque assumed to be set subsequently, after the decay of these decrementing or incrementing interventions, is not coordinated with the required torques of the external intervention. In the case of decrementing interventions which are retained for a fairly long time, for example, a predicated torque influenced by the corresponding external required torque value can also be output. In the simplest case, the required torques are selected on the basis of maximum and minimum value selection stages and accept, as resultant properties, the property (properties) associated with the selected required torque and, if appropriate, the condition and specified parameters. The output from the coordinator 2 08 is, therefore, a predicated propulsion torque MPRADVT, a resultant required propulsion torque MSOLLVT and resultant properties ' EMSOLLVT. This torque is, physically, the torque at the output from the propulsion train of the vehicle.<br>
As shown in the flow chart of Fig. 3b and in order to convert the propulsion torque values into gearbox output torque values, the parameters determined in the coordinator 208, the predicated propulsion torque and the required propulsion torque, are converted, in the step 213, in accordance with the train amplification, i.e. the amplification factor between output and gearbox - which is, for example, permanently specified in a memory cell 218 - and the gearbox loss torque mgetrver. The latter is formed, as a function of the current operating condition of the gearbox, by means of a characteristic field 220, for example. The result is corresponding gearbox output torque values. Where no propulsion torque values are contained, the properties are not converted. In an exemplary embodiment, the conversion takes place in the<br><br>
connection locations 214 to 216, in which the required torque values are respectively associated multiplicatively with the train amplification. The required gearbox output torque formed in this way and the predicated gearbox output torque are then corrected in connection locations 218 and 220 by means of the gearbox loss torque mgetrver. In the preferred exemplary embodiment, the gearbox loss torque is added to the predicated torque or the required gearbox output torque. In addition, the gearbox output torque values are converted into coupling torque values by means of the adjusted gearbox transmission ratio.<br>
The predicated torque and the required torque, together with its property vector, are supplied to coordinators 224 and 22 6. Parameters relative to the gearbox, i.e. specified parameters of the gearbox control for the gear-changing procedure and/or a gearbox protection function, are taken into account in these two coordinators. With respect to the gearbox protection, a maximum value for the coupling torque, to which the required coupling torque is limited, is specified in 22 8. In the case of gearbox intervention, a certain variation of coupling torque is specified which optimizes the gear-changing procedure. The required coupling torque is compared with these required torques in the coordinator 226 and, in an exemplary embodiment, the smallest is relayed as the required coupling torque. At least one property parameter is, in particular, associated with the required torque for the gearbox intervention, which property parameter specifies, for example, the necessary setting time for realizing the change in torque during the gear-changing procedure. This is coordinated with the at least one, corresponding property parameter of the required coupling torque, the property parameter of the gearbox intervention torque having priority in the case, for example, of an active gear-changing  procedure.   The  gearbox  intervention<br><br>
torque is associated with the predicated coupling torque in the coordinator 224. In one exemplary embodiment, the predicated coupling torque is passed on unaltered whereas, in another example, the predicated torque is adapted by the gearbox coupling torque, particularly in the case of interventions which last longer,<br>
The output parameters from the coordinators 224 and 22 6 are supplied to further coordinators 22 9 and 230,  in which the torque requirements of auxiliary units are taken into account. These, for example, are determined, as a function of the operating condition of the respective auxiliary unit (air conditioning plant, fans,  etc.),  by  characteristic  fields  232.  In  the coordinator 230, the required coupling torque [lacuna] associated with the consumption unit torque MVERBR, which represents the sum of the torque requirements of all the consumption units taken into account, at least one property parameter EMVERBR being associated with the consumption unit torque, Here again, the required setting  time  for  the  adjustment  of  the  torque requirement  of   the   consumption  units,   and   if appropriate the status of individual consumption units, is provided,  in particular,  as the property.  In an exemplary embodiment, the torque required value MVERBR is added to the required coupling torque, for example, in the coordinator 230 if the corresponding consumption unit is active. The shortest setting time, for example, is  passed  on  as  the  resultant  property  in  this embodiment. In the coordinator 229, the reserve torque MRESNA necessary  to  realize  the  torque  requirement MVERBR of the consumption units is associated with the predicated coupling torque,  in a manner analogous to the coordinator 22 4. In an exemplary embodiment,  the predicated torque is increased by the reserve torque, so that the predicated coupling torque is increased if an increase in torque due to the consumption units is to be  expected  (switch-on),  whereas  the  predicated<br><br>
coupling torque is reduced if a reduction of the torque requirement of the consumption units is to be expected (for example switch-off) . The output parameters of the coordinators 22 9 and 2 30 represent the external parameters which are represented in Fig.- 2 as output parameters from the coordinator 100, The coordinator 22 9 outputs a predicated engine output torque MPRADEX, the coordinator 230 an engine output required torque MSOLLEX and at least one associated property parameter EMSOLLEX.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3c, the parameters quoted are supplied to a coordinator 234, in which these parameters are coordinated with specified parameters specific to the engine. In this figure and in a preferred exemplary embodiment, a required value MSOLLBEG (from a torque limiting system 236) with associated property parameter EMSOLLBEG and a required parameter MSOLLNMAX (from a maximum rotational speed limiting system 238) with associated property parameter EMSOLLNMAX are supplied. The required value of the torque limiting system 236 is determined, for example, in accordance with the amount by which the actual torque exceeds a limiting value for the torque and the required torque of the maximum rotational speed limiting system 238 is determined as a function of the amount by which the rotational speed of the vehicle exceeds the maximum rotational speed. The setting times are correspondingly specified as preferred property parameter. As shown in Fig, 3c, the maximum rotational speed nmax can also be a property parameter of the vector EMSOLLEX and be specified externally.<br>
On the basis. of its input parameters, the coordinator 234 forms resultant output parameters for the engine output torque and the at least one associated property. In this process, in the preferred exemplary embodiment, the smallest is selected from the required parameters supplied and is output as the required output torque MSOLLINT. In another exemplary<br><br>
embodiment, the required parameters are associated with one another by means of arithmetic operations. In one exemplary embodiment, the predicated torque remains unaltered and, in another, it is adapted by means of the required parameters, in particular in the case of a decrementing intervention which lasts' longer. With respect to the at least property parameter [sic] , a coordination likewise takes place, the result being at least one resultant property parameter EMSOLLINT which, with respect to the setting time and depending on the embodiment, is the shortest of the setting times or the setting time associated with the resultant torque parameter. In addition, operating condition information is part of the property parameters, as sketched above.<br>
The required torque msollint is supplied to a connection location 24 0, in which the required torque is corrected as a function of the output signal of an engine stall protection control system 246, The latter represents a correction torque DMAWS, which is formed as a function of the engine rotational speed and a required engine stall protection rotational speed, the parameter of the correction torque being dependent on the distance between the actual rotational speed and the engine stall protection rotational speed. The conditional signal B_akt, which activates the control system when, for example, a driver's requirement or external intervention is present, is preferably part of the property vector EMSOLLEX, as given in Fig. 3c. The corrected required torque is then supplied to a connection location 242, in which a correction torque DMLLR of an idling control system 248 is connected to the required torque. The activation conditions B_akt and B_akt2 of the idling control system 24 8 (idling condition, no driver's requirement, etc.) are likewise part of the property vector EMSOLLEX. In addition, a minimum rotational speed NMIN of the idling control system is part of the property vector. The correction torque  DMLLR  is  formed  on  the  basis  of  actual<br><br>
rotational speed and required rotational speed. This correction torque is also connected to the predicated torque MPRADINT in the connection location 237,<br>
The engine loss torque values (drag torque values) MDS are formed in accordance with characteristic lines or characteristic fields 250 which depend on temperature and rotational speed. These engine loss torque values are connected to the predicated output torque and the required output torque in the connection locations 239 and 24 4, The result is an internal predicated torque MPRADIN and an internal required torque MSOLLIN, which are standardized with a reference torque MDNORM in further correction stages 252 and 254, Output parameters of the correction stages 252 and 254 are therefore standardized, predicated internal torques MPRADIN and standardized required values for the internal torque MSOLLIN. The standard torque is formed as a function of the operating parameters (for example rotational speed and load) in a characteristic field 256. The property vector EMSOLLINT formed by the coordinator 234 is not affected.<br>
The predicated internal torque and the internal required torque are, as shown in Fig. 3d, supplied to the converter 258 to which, in addition, the property vector EMSOLLINT, with which the internal required torque is to be converted, is also supplied. Furthermore, functions are arranged at this level which intervene directly in the setting paths of the engine, for example an anti-jolt control system 260, a control system 262, which provides a certain torque reserve by means of the ignition angle for heating the catalytic converter, and the idling control system part 264, which adjusts the idling torque reserve value and carries out the ignition angle intervention for the idling control system. On the basis of the functions quoted, control parameters are supplied to the converter 258, which takes account of the latter during the conversion of the required torque. The information<br><br>
on the respective activation range of the functions is transmitted, as indicated in Fig. 3d, as part of the property vector EMSOLLINT. On the basis of the required torque value MSOLLIN and taking account of the properties (in particular the setting time required), the converter 258 forms required torques MSOLLFU for the charge, MSOLLZW for the ignition angle, MSCLLK for the injection or diminution and, if appropriate, MSOLLLAD for the supercharger. These are adjusted by the corresponding setting devices 266, 268, 270 and 272, the required charge torque being converted into a required throttle plate setting, the other required torques being converted, taking account of the actual torque, to reduce the deviation. Such a procedural mode is known. The predicated torque and the reserve values formed by the catalytic converter heating control system and the idling control system are likewise taken into account. The maximum value of the required parameters available (MSOLLIN, MPRADIN, reserve) are preferably formed and output as a charge required value. The other interventions are activated as a function of the setting time and corresponding required parameters are formed. The output parameters of the functions (idling control system, anti-jolt control system), which act directly on the setting paths (large ignition angle), are connected directly to the corresponding required torques.<br>
Depending on the exemplary embodiment, the measures presented above in combination are realized in any given selection, and also individually. The preferred realization then takes place as a computer program, which is stored in a storage medium (diskette, storage module, computer, etc.).<br>
In a preferred exemplary embodiment, a specific configuration of the interface between the part specific to the engine and the part independent of the engine is presented in Figures 4 and 5, with provision of  the  parameters  to  be  made  available  by  the<br><br>
respective part. Fig. 4 relates to all the torque parameters and parameters which are directly related to the torque adjustment, while further parameters are presented in Fig. 5. These have been previously combined, essentially as a property -vector. The subdivision in Figures 4 and 5 only took place for reasons of comprehensibility.<br>
The particular feature of the interface shown in Figures 4 and 5 consists inter alia in the fact that parameters from the part specific to the engine are also transmitted to the part independent of the engine.<br>
The torque parameters to be made available by the part 302 specific to the engine and by the part 300 independent of the engine (preferably coupling torque parameters, crankshaft torque parameters or other engine output torque parameters) are represented in Fig. 4. The part 302 specific to the engine and the part 300 independent of the engine correspond essentially to the representation of Fig. 3.<br>
As already presented above using the embodiment of Fig. 3, the part 300 independent of the engine makes available the required torque parameters MSOLLEX, predicated required torque MPRADEX, which can also contain a specified torque reserve (both for example in Nm) and the required setting time TSOLLEX (for example in msec) , with which the required torque has to be adjusted. The latter is, above, part of the property vector. An example of the use of these parameters in the part specific to the engine is described above. As shown in Fig. 4, furthermore, the torque requirement of the auxiliary units MVERBR (for example in Nm) is made available by the part 300 independent of the engine. The determination of this torque value is described above. It represents the difference between engine output torque and coupling torque. It is evaluated in the part specific to the engine, for example during the calculation of the loss torques of the engine. In an exemplary embodiment,  a torque requirement parameter<br><br>
(for example in Nm), which is not represented in Fig. 4, is, furthermore, transmitted from the part 300 independent of the engine to the part 302 specific to the engine, which parameter describes the required torque without the correction due to the - intervention of a gearbox control system.<br>
The part 302 specific to the engine makes available, on the torque level (as shown in Fig. 4), the actual torque MIST (preferably the actual torque at the crankshaft), which is measured or calculated. In addition, a maximum adjustment range of the rapid path (adjustment by means of ignition angle, fuel quantity, etc.) is [lacuna] by means of maximum and minimum torque values MMAXDYN and MMINDYN, which can be adjusted by means of the parameters of the rapid adjustment path which can be influenced. These parameters are, for example, evaluated by external functions such as a drive slip control system, MMAXDYN or MMINDYN offering, for example, information about the possible rapid adjustment range, whereas MIST is introduced during the calculation of the specified values. In addition, characteristic lines - which describe the maximum and the minimum steady-state attainable torque MMAX and MMIN (minimum torque is equal to the maximum attainable drag torque) by means of the rotational speed, for example - are made available by the part 302 specific to the engine. These this [sic] as condition information in the determination of the gear-changing strategy. The characteristic lines are transmitted in the form of value pairs and are deposited in the part independent of the engine. In addition, the part 302 specific to the engine makes available an adaptation parameter MVERBRADAPT for the consumption unit torque MVERBR, which is determined in a known manner (see, for example, DE-A 43 04 779 = US 5 484 351) . With this information, the part independent of the engine is in a position to correct or adjust its calculations of the<br><br>
consumption unit torque MVERBR. Not represented are further parameters, which are transmitted to the part 300 independent of the engine, either in addition to those quoted above or as an alternative to them, by the part 302 specific to the engine, such as- the current drag torque, which is calculated, for 'example, as in the prior art given above, the current maximum torque (crankshaft torque, which depends on the current operating condition) and/or maximum and minimum torques (minimum torque = maximum attainable drag torque) attainable under optimum conditions (depending on the rotational speed, altitude, temperature, etc.). In an exemplary embodiment, all the torque parameters have the unit Nm.<br>
External to the torque level, as is shown in Fig. 5, the part independent of the engine makes available actuation signals (either continuously or as switching condition) for the accelerator pedal (ACC), for the brakes (BRAKE) and for the clutch (CLUTCH) (for example as a percentage parameter). These parameters are evaluated in the part 302 specific to the engine in order, for example, to activate various functions such as idling control system, comfort functions, etc. In order to also cover system groups which do not have the sensors necessary for this purpose, provision is made -alternatively or as a supplement - for the switching condition (for example as a bit signal) of a brake pedal contact and/or a clutch pedal contact to be transmitted by means of the interface. Not represented, furthermore, is information about the idling requirement of the driver (requirement for minimum torque, preferably likewise a bit signal), which can be transmitted, alternatively or additionally, in an exemplary embodiment. Another parameter (likewise as a bit signal and not represented) is the information that frictional connection is present in the drive train.<br>
A mark KOMF (coded word) is also made available and  this  provides  information  on  the  operating<br><br>
condition of comfort functions such as a load jolt damping function or a dashpot function (whether active or not). This parameter is used in the part 302 specific to the engine to estimate, for example, whether comfort questions have to be taken- into account in the adjustment of the torque (for example rapidity of the adjustment, jolt avoidance, etc.) and/or are evaluated for activating comfort functions such as load jolt damping or dashpot functions. In general, therefore, this parameter provides information on whether the comfort of the control has a high priority or not. It is also or alternatively possible for this parameter to contain information on whether the driver's requirement gradient is limited for comfort reasons, whether the frictional connection must be maintained during the control of the engine, whether a component protection system does not have to be observed, whether a dynamic or highly dynamic adjustment is necessary, whether comfort functions have to be taken into account or not during the adjustment of the engine, whether the driver's requirement value has to be adjusted with maximum priority, etc.<br>
Other parameters not represented can [lacuna] information about the gearbox mode (gearbox operating field position,  for example neutral,  1,  2,  D,  R,  P position, winter setting, etc.), gearbox type (manual change,  automatic,  CVT,  automated  shift  gearbox), currently  engaged gear  (idling,  first  gear,  second gear, etc. ) and/or information on the position of the ignition  switch  (off,  standby,  radio,  current  to control  unit  (terminal  15),  starter  (terminal  50), etc.). This information is preferably sent as a word of specified length, the information being coded.<br>
Additionally, or as a supplement, measurement parameters not specific to the engine are transmitted, in one embodiment, from the part independent of the engine to the part specific to the engine, for example<br><br>
external     temperature,     atmospheric     pressure, longitudinal speed, battery voltage, etc.<br>
In addition, externally specified minimum and maximum rotational speeds (NMINEX, NMAXEX) are made available which, for example, represent specified parameters in association with the 'idling control system and/or the engine stall protection control system (NMINEX) or a maximum rotational speed limitation (NMAXEX).<br>
ENGRUN (engine running) information, measured parameters specific to the engine such as the current engine rotational speed NMOT and/or the current engine temperature TMOT and the current maximum rotational speed NMAX and the current minimum rotational speed NMIN (= current required idling rotational speed) 'are made available by the part 302 specific to the engine. These parameters are used in the part independent of the engine for calculations (NMOT, for example in the case of the determination of the driver's requirement torque) or are used as condition information. Not represented are the integral proportion of the idling control system and/or the information on the overrun cut-off which has been effected and which, in one embodiment, are additionally or alternatively transmitted from the part specific to the engine to the part independent of the engine.<br>
The interface parameters quoted are, depending on the application, employed individually or in any given combination, as a function of the requirement and boundary conditions of the respective exemplary embodiment.<br>
Depending on the application, the part independent of the engine and the part specific to the engine are implemented in one computer unit, in two different computer units of a control unit or in two spatially separated control units.<br><br><br><br>
