Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to the field of biochemical assays and reagents.<br>
More specifically, this invention relates to mutant proteins covalently linked<br>
(tethered) to one or more functional groups and to methods for their use.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The specific detection of molecules is a keystone in understanding the<br>
role of that molecule in the cell. Labels, e.g., those that are covalently linked to<br>
a molecule of interest, permit the ready detection of that molecule in a complex<br>
mixture. The label may be one that is added by chemical synthesis in vitro or<br>
attached in vivo, e.g., via recombinant techniques. For instance, the attachment<br>
of fluorescent or other labels onto proteins has traditionally been accomplished<br>
by in vitro chemical modification after protein purification (Hermanson, 1996).<br>
For in vivo attachment of a label, green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the<br>
jellyfish Aequorea victoria can be genetically fused with many host proteins to<br>
produce fluorescent chimeras in situ (Tsien, 1998; Chalfie et al., 1998).<br>
However, while GFP-based indicators are currently employed in a variety of<br>
assays, e.g., measuring pH (Kneen et al., 1998; Llopis et al., 1998; Miesenbb'ck<br>
et al., 1998), Ca2+ (Miyawaki et al., 1997; Rosomer et al., 1997), and membrane<br>
potential (Siegel et al., 1997), the fluorescence of intrinsically labeled proteins<br>
such as GFP is limited by the properties of protein structure, e.g., a limited range<br>
of fluorescent colors and relatively low intrinsic brightness (Cubitt et al., 1995;<br>
Ormo'etal., 1996).<br>
To address the deficiencies of GFP labeling in situ, Griffen et al. (1998)<br>
synthesized a tight-binding pair of molecular components: a small receptor<br>
domain composed of as few as six natural amino acids and a small (
dalton), synthetic ligand that could be linked to various spectroscopic probes or<br>
crosslinks. The receptor domain included four cysteines at the i, i + 1, i + 4, and<br>
/ + 5 positions of an a helix and the ligand was 4',5'-bis(l,3,2-dithioarsolan-2-<br>
yl)fluorescein (FLASH). Griffen et al. disclose that the ligand had relatively few<br>
binding sites in nontransfected mammalian cells, was membrane-permeant and<br>
was nonfluorescent until it bound with high affinity and specificity to a<br>
tetracysteine domain in a recombinant protein, resulting in cells being<br>
fluorescently labeled ('TLASH" labeled) with a nanomolar or lower dissociation<br>
constant. However, with respect to background binding in cells, Stroffekova et<br>
al. (2001) disclose that FLASH-EDTa binds non-specifically to endogenous<br>
cysteine-rich proteins. Furthermore, labeling proteins by FLASH is limited by<br>
the range of fluorophores that may be used.<br>
Receptor-mediated targeting methods use genetically encoded targeting<br>
sequences to localize fluorophores to virtually any cellular site, provided that the<br>
targeted protein is able to fold properly. For example, Farinas et al. (1999)<br>
disclose that cDNA transfection was used to target a single-chain antibody (sFv)<br>
to a specified site in a cell. Farinas et al. disclose that conjugates of a hapten (4-<br>
ethoxymethylene-2-phenyl-2-oxazolin-5-one, phOx) and a fluorescent probe<br>
(e.g., BODIPY Fl, tetramethylrhodamine, and fluorescein) were bound with high<br>
affinity (about 5 nM) to the subcellular site for the sFv in living Chinese hamster<br>
ovary cells, indicating that the targeted antibody functioned as a high affinity<br>
receptor for the cell-permeable hapten-fluorophore conjugates. Nevertheless,<br>
functional sFv expression may be relatively poor in reducing environments.<br>
Thus, what is needed is an improved method to label a desired protein.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The invention provides methods, compositions and kits for tethering<br>
(linking), e.g., via a covalent or otherwise stable bond, one or more functional<br>
groups to a protein of the invention or to a fusion protein (chimera) which<br>
includes a protein of the invention. A protein of the invention is structurally<br>
related to a wild-type (native) hydrolase but comprises at least one amino acid<br>
substitution relative to the corresponding wild-type hydrolase and binds a<br>
substrate of the corresponding wild-type hydrolase but lacks or has reduced<br>
catalytic activity relative to the corresponding wild-type hydrolase (which<br>
mutant protein is referred to herein as a mutant hydrolase). The aforementioned<br>
tethering occurs, for instance, in solution or suspension, in a cell, on a solid<br>
support or at solution/surface interfaces, by employing a substrate for a<br>
hydrolase which includes a reactive group and which has been modified to<br>
include one or more functional groups. As used herein, a "substrate" includes a<br>
substrate having a reactive group and optionally one or more functional groups.<br>
A substrate which includes one or more functional groups is generally referred to<br>
herein as a substrate of the invention. As used herein, a "functional group" is a<br>
molecule which is detectable or is capable of detection (e.g., a chromophore,<br>
fluorophore or luminophore), or can be bound or attached to a second molecule<br>
(e.g., biotin, hapten, or a cross-linking group) or includes one or more amino<br>
acids, e.g., a peptide or polypeptide including an antibody or receptor, one or<br>
more nucleotides, lipids including lipid bilayers, a solid support, e.g., a<br>
sedimental particle, and the like. A functional group may have more than one<br>
property such as being capable of detection and being bound to another<br>
molecule. As used herein a "reactive group" is the minimum number of atoms in<br>
a substrate which are specifically recognized by a particular wild-type or mutant<br>
hydrolase of the invention. The interaction of a reactive group in a substrate and<br>
a wild-type hydrolase results in a product and the regeneration of the wild-type<br>
hydrolase. A substrate, e.g., a substrate of the invention, may also optionally<br>
include a linker, e.g., a cleavable linker.<br>
A substrate useful in the invention is one which is specifically bound by<br>
a mutant hydrolase, and preferably results in a bond formed with an amino acid,<br>
e.g., the reactive residue, of the mutant hydrolase which bond is more stable than<br>
the bond formed between the substrate and the corresponding amino acid of the<br>
wild-type hydrolase. While the mutant hydrolase specifically binds substrates<br>
which may be specifically bound by the corresponding wild-type hydrolase, no<br>
product or substantially less product, e.g., 2-, 10-, 100-, or 1000-fold less, is<br>
formed from the interaction between the mutant hydrolase and the substrate<br>
under conditions which result in product formation by a reaction between the<br>
corresponding wild-type hydrolase and substrate. The lack of, or reduced<br>
amounts of, product formation by the mutant hydrolase is due to at least one<br>
substitution in the mutant hydrolase, which substitution results in the mutant<br>
hydrolase forming a bond with the substrate which is more stable than the bond<br>
formed between the corresponding wild-type hydrolase and the substrate.<br>
Preferably, the bond formed between a mutant hydrolase and a substrate of the<br>
invention has a half-life (i.e., t^) that is at least 2-fold, and more preferably at<br>
least 4- or even 10-fold, and up to 100-, 1000- or 10,000-fold, greater than the t&gt;A<br>
of the bond formed between a corresponding wild-type hydrolase and the<br>
substrate under conditions which result in product formation by the<br>
corresponding wild-type hydrolase. Preferably, the bond formed between the<br>
mutant hydrolase and the substrate has a t^ of at least 30 minutes and preferably<br>
at least 4 hours, and up to at least 10 hours, and is resistant to disruption by<br>
washing, protein denaturants, and/or high temperatures, e.g., the bond is stable to<br>
boiling in SDS.<br>
In one embodiment, the substrate is a substrate for a dehalogenase, e.g., a<br>
haloalkane dehalogenase or a dehalogenase that cleaves carbon-halogen bonds in<br>
an aliphatic or aromatic halogenated substrate, such as a substrate for<br>
Rhodococcus, Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas, Burkholderia, Agrobacterium or<br>
Xanthobacter dehalogenase, of a substrate for a serine beta-lactamase. In one<br>
embodiment, a substrate of the invention optionally includes a linker which<br>
physically separates one or more functional groups from the reactive group in<br>
the substrate. For instance, for some mutant hydrolases, i.e., those with deep<br>
catalytic pockets, a substrate of the invention can include a linker of sufficient<br>
length and structure so that the one or more functional groups of the substrate of<br>
the invention do not disturb the 3-D structure of the hydrolase (wild-type or<br>
mutant). For example, one example of a substrate of the invention for a<br>
dehalogenase includes a reactive group such as (CtfekoX where X is a halide<br>
and a functional group such as tetramethyh-hodamine (TAMRA), e.g., TAMRACi4H24O4-<br>
Cl.<br>
In one embodiment, a linker is preferably 12 to 30 atoms in length. The<br>
linker may not always be present in a substrate of the invention, however, in<br>
some embodiments, the physical separation of the reactive group and the<br>
functional group may be needed so that the reactive group can interact with the<br>
reactive residue in the mutant hydrolase to form a covalent bond. Preferably,<br>
when present, the linker does not substantially alter, e.g., impair, the specificity<br>
or reactivity of a substrate having the linker with the wild-type or mutant<br>
hydrolase relative to the specificity or reactivity of a corresponding substrate<br>
which lacks the linker with the wild-type or mutant hydrolase. Further, the<br>
presence of the linker preferably does not substantially alter, e.g., impair, one or<br>
more properties, e.g., the function, of the functional group.<br>
Thus, the invention provides a compound of formula (I): R-linker-A-X,<br>
wherein R is one or more functional groups, wherein the linker is a multiatom<br>
straight or branched chain including C, N, S, or O, wherein A-X is a substrate for<br>
a dehalogenase, and wherein X is a halogen. In one embodiment, an alkylhalide<br>
is covalently attached to a linker, L, which is a group or groups that covalently<br>
attach one or more functional groups to form a substrate for a dehalogenase. As<br>
described herein, a mutant dehalogenase, DhaA.H272F, was bound to substrates<br>
for DhaA which included 5-(and 6-) carboxy fluorescein (FAM), e.g., FAM-<br>
4-Cl, TAMRA, e.g., TAMRA-Cn^CU-Cl, andbiotin, e.g., biotin-<br>
Cl, and there was no significant quenching effect of this binding on<br>
FAM or TAMRA fluorescence or on biotin binding to streptavidin. As also<br>
described herein, a mutant dehalogenase, e.g., DhaA.D106C and DhaA.D106E<br>
as well as DhaA.D106C:H272F and DhaA.D106E:H272F, bound FAMCi4H2404-<br>
Cl and/or TAMRA-Ci4H24O4-Cl. In one embodiment, the substrate is<br>
R-(CH2)2O(CH2)2O(CH2)2<xch2 wherein r is a functional group. to></xch2>
prepare such a substrate, a functional group may be reacted with a molecule such<br>
as NH(CH2)20(CH2)20(CH2)20(CH2)6C1.<br>
In one embodiment, substrates of the invention are permeable to the<br>
plasma membranes of cells. For instance, as described herein the plasma<br>
membranes of prokaryotic (E. coif) and eukaryotic (CHO-K1) cells were<br>
permeable to TAMRA-Ci4H2404-Cl and biotin-Cigl^CVCl and, these<br>
substrates were rapidly and efficiently loaded into and washed out of cells in the<br>
absence of a mutant hydrolase. hi the presence of a mutant hydrolase, at least a<br>
portion of the substrate was prevented from being washed out of the cells. Thus,<br>
the bound portion of the substrate can serve as a marker or as a means to capture<br>
the mutant hydrolase or a fusion thereof.<br>
The invention further provides methods for preparing a substrate for a<br>
hydrolase which substrate is modified to include one or more functional groups.<br>
Exemplary functional groups for use in the invention include, but are not limited<br>
to, an amino acid, protein, e.g., enzyme, antibody or other immunogenic protein,<br>
a radionuclide, a nucleic acid molecule, a drug, a lipid, biotin, avidin,<br>
streptavidin, a magnetic bead, a solid support, an electron opaque molecule,<br>
chromophore, MRI contrast agent, a dye, e.g., a xanthene dye, a calcium<br>
sensitive dye, e.g., l-[2-amino-5-(2,7-dichloro-6-hydroxy-3-oxy-9-xanthenyl)-<br>
phenoxy]-2-(2'-amino-5'-methylphenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraaceticacid<br>
(Fluo-3), a sodium sensitive dye, e.g., 1,3-benzenedicarboxylic acid, 4,4'-<br>
[ 1,4,10,13 -tetraoxa-7,16-diazacyclooctadecane-7,16-diylbis(5-methoxy-6,2-<br>
benzofurandiyl)]bis (PBFI), a NO sensitive dye, e.g., 4-amino-5-methylamino-<br>
2',7'-difluorescein, or other fluorophore. hi one embodiment, the functional<br>
group is an immunogenic molecule, i.e., one which is bound by antibodies<br>
specific for that molecule. In one embodiment, the functional group is not a<br>
radionuclide.<br>
The invention also includes a mutant hydrolase which comprises at least<br>
one amino acid substitution relative to a corresponding wild-type hydrolase,<br>
which substitutions) renders the mutant hydrolase capable of forming a bond,<br>
e.g., a covalent bond with a substrate for the corresponding hydrolase, e.g., a<br>
substrate of the invention, which is more stable than the bond formed between a<br>
corresponding wild-type hydrolase and the substrate.<br>
In one embodiment, the mutant hydrolase of the invention comprises at<br>
least one ammo acid substitution hi a residue which, in the wild-type hydrolase,<br>
is associated with activating a water molecule, e.g., a residue in a catalytic triad<br>
or an auxiliary residue, wherein the activated water molecule cleaves the bond<br>
formed between a catalytic residue in the wild-type hydrolase and a substrate of<br>
the hydrolase. As used herein, an "auxiliary residue" is a residue which alters<br>
the activity of another residue, e.g., it enhances the activity of a residue that<br>
activates a water molecule. Residues which activate water within the scope of<br>
the invention include but are not limited to those involved in acid-base catalysis,<br>
6<br>
for instance, histidine, aspartic acid and glutamic acid. In another embodiment,<br>
the mutant hydrolase of the invention comprises at least one amino acid<br>
substitution in a residue which, in the wild-type hydrolase, forms an ester<br>
intermediate by nucleophilic attack of a substrate for the hydrolase.<br>
For example, wild-type dehalogenase DhaA cleaves carbon-halogen<br>
bonds in halogenated hydrocarbons (HaloC3-HaloCio). The catalytic center of<br>
DhaA is a classic catalytic triad including a nucleophile, an acid and a histidine<br>
residue. The amino acids in the triad are located deep inside the catalytic pocket<br>
of DhaA (about 10 A long and about 20 A2 'in cross section). The halogen atom<br>
in a halogenated substrate for DhaA, for instance, the chlorine atom of a Clalkane<br>
substrate, is positioned in close proximity to the catalytic center of DhaA.<br>
DhaA binds the substrate, likely forms an ES complex, and an ester intermediate<br>
is formed by nucleophilic attack of the substrate by Aspl06 (the numbering is<br>
based on the protein sequence of DhaA) of DhaA (Figure 1). His272 of DhaA<br>
then activates water and the activated water hydrolyzes the intermediate,<br>
releasing product from the catalytic center. As described herein, mutant DhaAs,<br>
e.g., a DhaA.H272F mutant, which likely retains the 3-D structure based on a<br>
computer modeling study and basic physico-chemical characteristics of wildtype<br>
DhaA (DhaA.WT), were not capable of hydrolyzing one or more substrates<br>
of the wild-type enzyme, e.g., for Cl-alkanes, releasing the corresponding<br>
alcohol released by the wild-type enzyme. As further described herein, mutant<br>
serine beta-lactamases, e.g., a blaZ.E166D mutant, a blaZ.N170Q mutant and a<br>
blaZ.El 66D:N170Q mutant, were not capable of hydrolyzing one or more<br>
substrates of a wild-type serine beta-lactamase.<br>
Thus, in one embodiment of the invention, a mutant hydrolase is a<br>
mutant dehalogenase comprising at least one amino acid substitution in a residue<br>
which, in the wild-type dehalogenase, is associated with activating a water<br>
molecule, e.g., a residue in a catalytic triad or an auxiliary residue, wherein the<br>
activated water molecule cleaves the bond formed between a catalytic residue in<br>
the wild-type dehalogenase and a substrate of the dehalogenase. In one<br>
embodiment, at least one substitution is in a residue corresponding to residue<br>
272 in DhaA from Rhodococcus rhodochrous. A "corresponding residue" is a<br>
residue which has the same activity (function) in one wild-type protein relative<br>
to a reference wild-type protein and optionally is in the same relative position<br>
when the primary sequences of the two proteins are aligned. For example, a<br>
residue which forms part of a catalytic triad and activates a water molecule in<br>
one enzyme may be residue 272 in that enzyme, which residue 272 corresponds<br>
to residue 73 in another enzyme, wherein residue 73 forms part of a catalytic<br>
triad and activates a water molecule. Thus, in one embodiment, a mutant<br>
dehalogenase of the invention has a phenylalanine residue at a position<br>
corresponding to residue 272 in DhaA from Rhodococcus rhodochrous. In<br>
another embodiment of the invention, a mutant hydrolase is a mutant<br>
dehalogenase comprising at least one amino acid substitution in a residue<br>
corresponding to residue 106 in DhaA from Rhodococcus rhodochrous. For<br>
example, a mutant dehalogenase of the invention has a cysteine or a glutamate<br>
residue at a position corresponding to residue 106 in DhaA from Rhodococcus<br>
rhodochrous. In a further embodiment, the mutant hydrolase is a mutant<br>
dehalogenase comprising at least two amino acid substitutions, one in a residue<br>
corresponding to residue 106 and one in a residue corresponding to residue 272<br>
in DhaA from Rhodococcus rhodochrous. In yet a further embodiment, the<br>
mutant hydrolase is a mutant serine beta-lactamase comprising at least one<br>
amino acid substitution in a residue corresponding to residue 166 or residue 170<br>
in a serine beta-lactamase of Staphylococcus aureus PCI.<br>
The mutant hydrolase may be a fusion protein, e.g., a fusion protein<br>
expressed from a recombinant DNA which encodes the mutant hydrolase and at<br>
least one protein of interest or a fusion protein formed by chemical synthesis.<br>
For instance, the fusion protein may comprise a mutant hydrolase and an enzyme<br>
of interest, e.g., luciferase, RNasin or RNase, and/or a channel protein, a<br>
receptor, a membrane protein, a cytosolic protein, a nuclear protein, a structural<br>
protein, a phosphoprotein, a kinase, a signaling protein, a metabolic protein, a<br>
mitochondria! protein, a receptor associated protein, a fluorescent protein, an<br>
enzyme substrate, a transcription factor, a transporter protein and/or a targeting<br>
sequence, e.g., a myristilation sequence, a mitochondrial localization sequence,<br>
or a nuclear localization sequence, that directs the mutant hydrolase, for<br>
example, a fusion protein, to a particular location. The protein of interest may be<br>
fused to the N-terminus or the C-terminus of the mutant hydrolase. In one<br>
embodiment, the fusion protein comprises a protein of interest at the N-terminus,<br>
and another protein, e.g., a different protein, at the C-terminus, of the mutant<br>
hydrolase. For example, the protein of interest may be a fluorescent protein or<br>
an antibody. Optionally, the proteins in the fusion are separated by a connector<br>
sequence, e.g., preferably one having at least 2 amino acid residues, such as one<br>
having 13 to 17 amino acid residues. The presence of a connector sequence in a<br>
fusion protein of the invention does not substantially alter the function of either<br>
protein in the fusion relative to the function of each individual protein. Thus, for<br>
a fusion of a mutant dehalogenase and Renilla luciferase, the presence of a<br>
connector sequence does not substantially alter the stability of the bond formed<br>
between the mutant dehalogenase and a substrate therefor or the activity of the<br>
luciferase. For any particular combination of proteins in a fusion, a wide variety<br>
of connector sequences may be employed. In one embodiment, the connector<br>
sequence is a sequence recognized by an enzyme, e.g., a cleavable sequence.<br>
For instance, the connector sequence may be one recognized by a caspase, e.g.,<br>
DEVD (SEQ ID NO:64), or is a photocleavable sequence.<br>
In one embodiment, the fusion protein may comprise a protein of interest<br>
at the N-terminus and, preferably, a different protein of interest at the C-terminus<br>
of the mutant hydrolase. As described herein, fusions of a mutant DhaA with<br>
GST (at the N-terminus), a Flag sequence (at the C-terminus) and Renilla<br>
luciferase (at the N-terminus or C-terminus) had no detectable effect on bond<br>
formation between the mutant DhaA and a substrate for wild-type DhaA which<br>
includes a functional group. Moreover, a fusion of a Flag sequence and<br>
DhaA.H272F could be attached to a solid support via a streptavidin-biotin-<br>

of Renilla luciferase (RXuc) and DhaA.H272F could be attached to Magnesil™<br>

group. In addition, the attached fusion comprising R.Luc was shown to be<br>
enzymatically active.<br>

includes a solid support comprising a substrate of the invention, a kit comprising<br>
a substrate of the invention, a kit comprising a vector encoding a dehalogenase<br>
of the invention, or a kit comprising a vector encoding a serine beta-lactamase of<br>
the invention.<br>
Also provided is an isolated nucleic acid molecule (polynucleotide)<br>
comprising a nucleic acid sequence encoding a hydrolase. hi one embodiment,<br>
the isolated nucleic acid molecule comprises a nucleic acid sequence which is<br>
optimized for expression in at least one selected host. Optimized sequences<br>
include sequences which are codon optimized, i.e., codons which are employed<br>
more frequently in one organism relative to another organism, e.g., a distantly<br>
related organism, as well as modifications to add or modify Kozak sequences<br>
and/or introns, and/or to remove undesirable sequences, for instance, potential<br>
transcription factor binding sites. In one embodiment, the polynucleotide<br>
includes a nucleic acid sequence encoding a dehalogenase, which nucleic acid<br>
sequence is optimized for expression is a selected host cell. In one embodiment,<br>
the optimized polynucleotide no longer hybridizes to the corresponding nonoptimized<br>
sequence, e.g., does not hybridize to the non-optimized sequence<br>
under medium or high stringency conditions. In another embodiment, the<br>
polynucleotide has less than 90%, e.g., less than 80%, nucleic acid sequence<br>
identity to the corresponding non-optimized sequence and optionally encodes a<br>
polypeptide having at least 80%, e.g., at least 85%, 90% or more, ammo acid<br>
sequence identity with the polypeptide encoded by the non-optimized sequence.<br>
Constructs, e.g., expression cassettes, and vectors comprising the isolated<br>
nucleic acid molecule, as well as kits comprising the isolated nucleic acid<br>
molecule, construct or vector are also provided.<br>
Further provided is a method of expressing a mutant hydrolase of the<br>
invention. The method comprises introducing to a host cell a recombinant<br>
nucleic acid molecule encoding a mutant hydrolase of the invention so as to<br>
express the mutant hydrolase. In one embodiment, the mutant hydrolase may be<br>
isolated from the cell. The mutant hydrolase may be expressed transiently or<br>
stably, constitutively or under tissue-specific or drug-regulated promoters, and<br>
the like. Also provided is an isolated host cell comprising a recombinant nucleic<br>
acid molecule encoding a mutant hydrolase of the invention.<br>
In one embodiment, the invention provides a method to detect or<br>
determine the presence or amount of a mutant hydrolase. The method includes<br>
contacting a mutant hydrolase with a hydrolase substrate which comprises one or<br>
more functional groups. The mutant hydrolase comprises at least one amino acid<br>
substitution relative to a corresponding wild-type hydrolase, wherein the at least<br>
one amino acid substitution results in the mutant hydrolase forming a bond with<br>
the substrate which is more stable than the bond formed between the<br>
corresponding wild-type hydrolase and the substrate, and wherein the at least<br>
one amino acid substitution in the mutant hydrolase is a substitution at an amino<br>
acid residue in the corresponding wild-type hydrolase that is associated with<br>
activating a water molecule which cleaves the bond formed between the<br>
corresponding wild-type hydrolase and the substrate or at an amino acid residue<br>
in the corresponding wild-type hydrolase that forms an ester intermediate with<br>
the substrate. The presence or amount of me functional group is detected or<br>
determined, thereby detecting or determining the presence or amount of the<br>
mutant hydrolase. In one embodiment, the mutant hydrolase is in or on the<br>
surface of a cell. In another embodiment, the mutant hydrolase is in a cell lysate.<br>
Also provided are methods of using a mutant hydrolase and a substrate<br>
for a corresponding hydrolase which includes one or more functional groups,<br>
e.g., to isolate a molecule or to detect or determine the presence or amount of,<br>
location, e.g., intracellular, subcellular or extracellular location, or movement of<br>
certain molecules in cells. In one embodiment, a method to isolate a molecule of<br>
interest in a sample is provided. The method includes contacting a sample with a<br>
fusion protein comprising a mutant hydrolase and a protein which binds a<br>
molecule of interest with a hydrolase substrate which comprises one or more<br>
functional groups. The mutant hydrolase comprises at least one arnino acid<br>
substitution relative to a corresponding wild-type hydrolase, wherein the at least<br>
one amino acid substitution results in the mutant hydrolase forming a bond with<br>
the substrate which is more stable than the bond formed between the<br>
corresponding wild-type hydrolase and the substrate, and wherein the at least<br>
one amino acid substitution in the mutant hydrolase is a substitution at an amino<br>
acid residue in the corresponding wild-type hydrolase that is associated with<br>
activating a water molecule which cleaves the bond formed between the<br>
corresponding wild-type hydrolase and the substrate or at an amino acid residue<br>
in the corresponding wild-type hydrolase that forms an ester intermediate with<br>
the substrate. In one embodiment, at least one functional group is a solid support<br>
or a molecule which binds to a solid support. In one embodiment, the sample<br>
contains intact cells while in another embodiment, the sample is a cell lysate or<br>
subcellular fraction. Then the molecule of interest is isolated.<br>
For example, the invention includes method to isolate a protein of<br>
interest. The method includes contacting a fusion protein comprising a mutant<br>
hydrolase and a protein of interest with a hydrolase substrate which comprises at<br>
least one functional group. The mutant hydrolase comprises at least one amino<br>
acid substitution relative to a corresponding wild-type hydrolase, wherein the at<br>
least one amino acid substitution results in the mutant hydrolase forming a bond<br>
with the substrate which is more stable than the bond formed between the wildtype<br>
hydrolase and the substrate, and wherein the at least one amino acid<br>
substitution in the mutant hydrolase is a substitution at an amino acid residue in<br>
the wild-type hydrolase that is associated with activating a water molecule which<br>
cleaves a bond formed between the wild-type hydrolase and the substrate or at an<br>
amino acid residue in the wild-type hydrolase that forms an ester intermediate<br>
with the substrate, hi one embodiment, at least one functional group is a solid<br>
support or a molecule which binds to a solid support Then the protein of<br>
interest is isolated.<br>
In another embodiment, the invention includes a method to identify an<br>
agent that alters the interaction of a protein of interest with a molecule suspected<br>
of interacting with the protein of interest. The method includes contacting at<br>
least one agent with the molecule suspected of interacting with the protein of<br>
interest, a fusion protein comprising mutant hydrolase and the protein of interest,<br>
and a hydrolase substrate which comprises one or more functional groups. The<br>
mutant hydrolase comprises at least one amino acid substitution relative to a<br>
corresponding wild-type hydrolase, wherein the at least one amino acid<br>
substitution results in the mutant hydrolase forming a bond with the substrate<br>
which is more stable than the bond formed between the corresponding wild-type<br>
hydrolase and the substrate, and wherein the at least one amino acid substitution<br>
in the mutant hydrolase is a substitution at an amino acid residue in the<br>
corresponding wild-type hydrolase that is associated with activating a water<br>
molecule which cleaves a bond formed between the corresponding wild-type<br>
hydrolase and the substrate at an amino acid residue in the wild-type hydrolase<br>
that forms an ester intermediate with the substrate. In one embodiment at least<br>
one functional group is a solid support or a molecule which binds to a solid<br>
support. Then it is determined whether the agent alters the interaction between<br>
the protein of interest and the molecule suspected of interacting with the protein<br>
of interest.<br>
Moreover, a substrate of the invention bound to a solid support or a<br>
mutant hydrolase bound to a solid support may be used to generate protein<br>
arrays, cell arrays, vesicle/organelle arrays and cell membrane arrays.<br>
The invention thus provides methods to monitor the expression, location<br>
and/or movement (trafficking) of proteins in a cell as well as to monitor changes<br>
in microenvironments within a cell. In one embodiment, the use of a mutant<br>
hydrolase and a substrate of the invention permits functional analysis of proteins,<br>
e.g., ion channels. In another embodiment, the use of two pairs of a mutant<br>
hydrolase/substrate permits multiplexing, simultaneous detection, and FRET- or<br>
BRET-based assays. For example, mutant dehalogenases with substitutions at<br>
different residues of a catalytic triad may each preferentially bind certain<br>
substrates of the invention but not others or a mutant dehalogenase and a mutant<br>
beta-lactamase may be employed with their respective substrates, thus permitting<br>
multiplexing. Other applications include capturing the stable complex which<br>
results from contacting the mutant hydrolase with a corresponding substrate of<br>
the invention, on a solid substrate for analytical or industrial purposes (e.g., to<br>
study kinetic parameters of the tethered enzyme, to generate enzyme<br>
chains/arrays, to metabolize industrial components, and the like), to detect<br>
protein-protein interactions, to determine the effect of different<br>
compounds/drugs on an interaction between a fusion protein comprising a<br>
protein of interest and a mutant hydrolase with other molecules, to isolate or<br>
purify molecules which bind to a protein of interest fused to the mutant<br>
hydrolase, or to isolate or purify cells, organelles or fragments thereof. For<br>
example, a protein of interest may be fused to a mutant hydrolase and then<br>
linked to a solid support via the specific interaction of a functional group which<br>
is a ligand for an acceptor group and is present in a substrate of the invention,<br>
with an acceptor group present on the solid support. Such a substrate may be<br>
contacted with the fusion protein prior to contact with the solid support,<br>
contacted with the solid support prior to contact with the fusion protein, or<br>
simultaneously contacted with the fusion protein and the solid support. Such a<br>
system permits the resulting complex to be employed to detect or isolate<br>
molecules which bind to the protein of interest. The binding molecule may be a<br>
protein, e.g., a fusion of the binding protein and a functional group, e.g., GFP,<br>
luciferase, an antibody, e.g., one conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP),<br>
alkaline phosphatase (AP) or a fluorophore.<br>
To isolate, sort or purify cells, the mutant hydrolase may be expressed on<br>
the outside surface of cells (e.g., via a fusion with a plasma membrane protein).<br>
To isolate, purify or separate organelles, the mutant hydrolase is expressed on<br>
the cytosolic surface of the organelle of interest. In another embodiment, to<br>
create an optimal platform for growing different cells, the mutant hydrolase is<br>
fused with an extracellular matrix component or an outer membrane protein and<br>
tethered to a three-dimensional cell culture or a platform for tissue engineering.<br>
As an example, primary neurons or embryonic stem cells may be grown on the<br>
platform to form a feeder layer.<br>
Other applications include detecting or labeling cells. Thus, the use of a<br>
mutant hydrolase and a corresponding substrate of the invention permits the<br>
detection of cells, for instance, to detect cell migration in vitro or in vivo after<br>
implantation or injection into animals (e.g., angiogenesis/chemotaxis assays,<br>
migration of implanted neurons, normal, malignant, or recombinantly modified<br>
cells implanted/injected into animals, and the like), and live cell imaging<br>
followed by immunocytochemistry. In another embodiment, the invention<br>
provides a method to label newly synthesized proteins. For example, cells<br>
comprising a vector which expresses a mutant hydrolase of the invention or a<br>
fusion thereof, are contacted with a substrate for the hydrolase which lacks a<br>
functional group. Cells are then contacted with an agent, e.g., an inducer of gene<br>
expression, and a substrate for the hydrolase which contains one or more<br>
functional groups. The presence, amount or location of the mutant hydrolase or<br>
fusion thereof is thenidetected or determined. The presence, amount or location<br>
of the mutant hydrolase or fusion thereof is due to newly synthesized mutant<br>
hydrolase or a fusion thereof. Alternatively, cells comprising a vector which<br>
expresses a mutant hydrolase of the invention or a fusion thereof, are contacted<br>
with a substrate for the hydrolase having a functional group, e.g., a green<br>
fluorophore, then contacted with an agent and a substrate havinga different<br>
functional group, e.g., a red fluorophore. In one embodiment, the mutant<br>
hydrolase is fused to a membrane localization signal and so can be employed to<br>
monitor events in or near the membrane.<br>
Accordingly, the invention provides a method to label a cell. The<br>
method includes contacting a cell comprising a mutant hydrolase with a<br>
hydrolase substrate which comprises one or more functional groups. The mutant<br>
hydrolase comprises at least one amino acid substitution relative to a<br>
corresponding wild-type hydrolase, wherein the at least one amino acid<br>
substitution results in the mutant hydrolase forming a bond with the substrate<br>
which is more stable than the bond formed between the corresponding wild-type<br>
hydrolase and the substrate, and wherein the at least one amino acid substitution<br>
in the mutant hydrolase is a substitution at an amino acid residue in the<br>
corresponding wild-type hydrolase that is associated with activating a water<br>
molecule which cleaves a bond formed between the corresponding wild-type<br>
hydrolase and the substrate or at an amino acid residue in the corresponding<br>
wild-type hydrolase that forms an ester intermediate with the substrate. Then the<br>
presence or amount of the functional group is detected or determined.<br>
Cells expressing selectable marker proteins, such as ones encoding<br>
resistance to neomycin, hygromycin, or puromycin, are used to stably transform<br>
cells with foreign DNA. It may be desirable to observe which cells contain<br>
selectable marker proteins as well as fluorescently labeled molecules. For<br>
instance, it may be preferable to label the selectable marker protein with a<br>
fluorescent molecule that is added exogenously to living cells. By this method,<br>
the selectable marker protein becomes visible when only when needed by<br>
addition of the fluorophore, and the fluorescence will subsequently be lost when<br>
selectable marker proteins are naturally regenerated through cellular metabolism.<br>
Thus, in one embodiment, the invention provides a method for labeling a cell<br>
which expresses a selectable marker protein. The method includes providing a<br>
cell comprising an expression cassette comprising a nucleic acid sequence<br>
encoding a fusion protein. The fusion protein comprises a selectable marker<br>
protein, e.g., one which confers resistance to at least one antibiotic, and a second<br>
protein that is capable of stably and optionally irreversibly binding a substrate or<br>
a portion thereof which includes an optically detectable molecule. For instance,<br>
the protein may be an alkyl transferase which irreversibly transfers an alkyl<br>
group and an optically detectable molecule from a substrate to itself, thereby<br>
labeling the alkyl transferase, e.g., an alkyl transferase such as O6-alkylguanine<br>
DNA alkyltransferase. Exemplary proteins useful in this embodiment of the<br>
invention include, but are not limited to, alkyl transferases, peptidyl glycinealpha-<br>
amidating monoxygenases, type I topoisomerases, hydrolases, e.g., serine<br>
and epoxide hydrolases as well as the mutant hydrolases described herein,<br>
aminotransferases, cytochrome P4SO monooxygenases, acetyl transferases,<br>
decarboxylases, oxidases, e.g., monoamine oxidases, reductases, e.g.,<br>
ribonucleotide reductase, synthetases, e.g., cyclic ADP ribose synthetase or<br>
thymidylate synthetase, dehydrogenases, e.g., aldehyde dehydrogenase,<br>
syntheses, e.g., nitric oxide synthase (NOS), lactamases, cystathionine gammalyases,<br>
peptidases, e.g., carboxypeptidase A, aromatase, proteases, e.g., serine<br>
protease, xylanases, glucosidases, mannosidases, and demethylases and other<br>
proteins, including wild-type proteins, which form an irreversible or otherwise<br>
stable bond with one or more substrates, e.g., enzymes which are capable of<br>
mechanism-based inactivation. Thus, in this embodiment, a stable bond, i.e.,<br>
one which is formed between a substrate and a wild-type or mutant enzyme, has<br>
a t&gt;A of at least 30 minutes and preferably at least 4 hours, and up to at least 10<br>
hours, and is resistant to disruption by washing, protein denaturants, and/or high<br>
temperatures, e.g., the bond is stable to boiling in SDS.<br>
The cell which expresses the fusion protein is contacted with the<br>
substrate so as to label the cell. In one embodiment, the cell is fixed prior to<br>
contact with the substrate. In another embodiment, the substrate and fixative are<br>
contacted with the cell at the same time. In yet another embodiment, the fixative<br>
is added to the cell after the cell is contacted with the substrate. In one<br>
embodiment, the fusion protein forms an ester bond with the substrate. In<br>
another embodiment, the fusion protein forms a thioester bond with the<br>
substrate. Also provided is a fusion gene encoding the fusion protein, and a cell<br>
which expresses the fusion protein.<br>
When performing image analysis on a cell, it may be desirable to fix the<br>
cell with a preservative (fixative) such as paraformaldehyde, acetone or<br>
methanol which generally maintains most features of cellular structure. Such<br>
fixed cells are then often analyzed by adding fluorescent stains or fluorescently<br>
labeled antibodies to reveal specific structures within the cells. Another method<br>
to fluorescently label cells is to express a fluorescent protein, e.g., GFP, in cells<br>
prior to fixation. Unfortunately, the efficient fluorescence of these proteins is<br>
dependent on protein structure, which can be disrupted by preservatives, thus<br>
decreasing the efficiency of imaging in those cells.<br>
Accordingly, the invention provides a method for labeling a cell with a<br>
functional group, e.g., fluorophore. The method includes providing a cell which<br>
expresses a mutant hydrolase of the invention or a fusion thereof, and contacting<br>
the cell with a hydrolase substrate which includes at least one functional group.<br>
In one embodiment, the cell is fixed prior to contact with the substrate. In<br>
another embodiment, the substrate and fixative are contacted with the cell at the<br>
same time. In yet another embodiment, the fixative is added to the cell after the<br>
cell is contacted with the substrate. Then the presence or location of the mutant<br>
hydrolase, or fusion thereof, in the cell is detected or determined. In one<br>
embodiment, the mutant hydrolase forms an ester bond with the substrate, while<br>
in another embodiment, the mutant hydrolase forms a thioester bond with the<br>
substrate.<br>
The invention also provides processes and intermediates disclosed herein<br>
that are useful for preparing compounds, compositions, nucleic acids, proteins,<br>
or other materials of the invention.<br>

Figure 20 illustrates a reaction scheme for a serine beta-lactamase. The<br>
reaction begins with the formation of a precovalent encounter complex (Figure<br>
19A), and moves through a high-energy acylation tetrahedral intermediate<br>
(Figure 19B) to form a transiently stable acyl-enzyme intermediate, forming an<br>
ester through the catalytic residue Ser70 (Figure 19C). Subsequently, the acylenzyme<br>
is attacked by hydrolytic water (Figure 19D) to form a high-energy<br>
deacylation intermediate (Figure 19E) (Minasov et al., 2002), which collapses to<br>
form the hydrolyzed product (Figure 19F). The product is then expelled,<br>
regenerating free enzyme.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
Definitions<br>
A "nucleophile" is a molecule which donates electrons.<br>
A "selectable marker protein" encodes an enzymatic activity that confers<br>
to a cell the ability to grow in medium lacking what would otherwise be an<br>
essential nutrient (e.g., the TRP1 gene hi yeast cells) or in a medium with an<br>
antibiotic or other drug, i.e., the expression of the gene encoding the selectable<br>
marker protein in a cell confers resistance to an antibiotic or drug to that cell<br>
relative to a corresponding cell without the gene. When a host cell must express<br>
a selectable marker to grow hi selective medium, the marker is said to be a<br>
positive selectable marker (e.g., antibiotic resistance genes which confer the<br>
ability to grow in the presence of the appropriate antibiotic). Selectable markers<br>
can also be used to select against host cells containing a particular gene (e.g., the<br>
sacB gene which, if expressed, kills the bacterial host cells grown in medium<br>
containing 5% sucrose); selectable markers used in this manner are referred to as<br>
negative selectable markers or counter-selectable markers. Common selectable<br>
marker gene sequences include those for resistance to antibiotics such as<br>
ampicillin, tetracycline, kanamycin, puromycin, bleomycin, streptomycin,<br>
hygromycin, neomycin, Zeocin™, and the like. Selectable auxotrophic gene<br>
sequences include, for example, hisD, which allows growth in histidine free<br>
media in the presence of histidinol. Suitable selectable marker genes include a<br>
bleomycin-resistance gene, a metallothionein gene, a hygromycin Bphosphotransferase<br>
gene, the AURI gene, an adenosine deaminase gene, an<br>
aminoglycoside phosphotransferase gene, a dihydrofolate reductase gene, a<br>
thymidine kinase gene, a xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase gene, and<br>
the like.<br>
A "nucleic acid", as used herein, is a covalently linked sequence of<br>
nucleotides in which the 3' position of the pentose of one nucleotide is joined by<br>
a phosphodiester group to the 5' position of the pentose of the next, and in which<br>
the nucleotide residues (bases) are linked in specific sequence, i.e., a linear order<br>
of nucleotides. A "polynucleotide", as used herein, is a nucleic acid containing a<br>
sequence mat is greater than about 100 nucleotides in length. An<br>
"oligonucleotide" or "primer", as used herein, is a short polynucleotide or a<br>
portion of a polynucleotide. The term "oligonucleotide" or "oligo" as used<br>
herein is defined as a molecule comprised of 2 or more deoxyribonucleotides or<br>
ribonucleotides, preferably more than 3, and usually more than 10, but less than<br>
250, preferably less than 200, deoxyribonucleotides or ribonucleotides. The<br>
oligonucleotide may be generated in any manner, including chemical synthesis,<br>
DNA replication, amplification, e.g., polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse<br>
transcription (RT), or a combination thereof. A "primer" is an oligonucleotide<br>
which is capable of acting as a point of initiation for nucleic acid synthesis when<br>
placed under conditions hi which primer extension is initiated. A primer is<br>
selected to have on its 3' end a region that is substantially complementary to a<br>
specific sequence of the target (template). A primer must be sufficiently<br>
complementary to hybridize with a target for primer elongation to occur. A<br>
primer sequence need not reflect the exact sequence of the target. For example, a<br>
non-complementary nucleotide fragment may be attached to the 5' end of the<br>
primer, with the remainder of the primer sequence being substantially<br>
complementary to the target. Non-complementary bases or longer sequences can<br>
be interspersed into the primer provided that the primer sequence has sufficient<br>
complementarity with the sequence of the target to hybridize and thereby form a<br>
complex for synthesis of the extension product of the primer. Primers matching<br>
or complementary to a gene sequence may be used in amplification reactions,<br>
RT-PCR and the like.<br>
Nucleic acid molecules are said to have a "S'-terminus" (5' end) and a<br>
"3'-terminus" (3' end) because nucleic acid phosphodiester linkages occur to the<br>
5' carbon and 3' carbon of the pentose ring of the substituent mononucleotides.<br>
The end of a polynucleotide at which a new linkage would be to a 5' carbon is its<br>
5' terminal nucleotide. The end of a polynucleotide at which a new linkage<br>
would be to a 3' carbon is its 3' terminal nucleotide. A terminal nucleotide, as<br>
used herein, is the nucleotide at the end position of the 3'- or 5'-terminus.<br>
DNA molecules are said to have "5' ends" and "3' ends" because<br>
mononucleotides are reacted to make oHgonucleotides in a manner such that the<br>
5' phosphate of one mononucleotide pentose ring is attached to the 3' oxygen of<br>
its neighbor in one direction via a phosphodiester linkage. Therefore, an end of<br>
an oHgonucleotides referred to as the "5' end" if its 5' phosphate is not linked to<br>
the 3' oxygen of a mononucleotide pentose ring and as the "3; end" if its 3'<br>
oxygen is not linked to a 5' phosphate of a subsequent mononucleotide pentose<br>
ring.<br>
As used herein, a nucleic acid sequence, even if internal to a larger<br>
oligonucleotide or polynucleotide, also may be said to have 5' and 3' ends. In<br>
either a linear or circular DNA molecule, discrete elements are referred to as<br>
being "upstream" or 5' of the "downstream" or 3' elements. This terminology<br>
reflects the fact that transcription proceeds in a 5' to 3' fashion along the DNA<br>
strand. Typically, promoter and enhancer elements that direct transcription of a<br>
linked gene (e.g., open reading frame or coding region) are generally located 5'<br>
or upstream of the coding region. However, enhancer elements can exert their<br>
effect even when located 3' of the promoter element and the coding region.<br>
Transcription termination and polyadenylation signals are located 3' or<br>
downstream of the coding region.<br>
The term "codon" as used herein, is a basic genetic coding unit,<br>
consisting of a sequence of three nucleotides that specify a particular amino acid<br>
to be incorporation into a polypeptide chain, or a start or stop signal. The term<br>
"coding region" when used in reference to structural gene refers to the nucleotide<br>
sequences that encode the amino acids found in the nascent polypeptide as a<br>
result of translation of a mRNA molecule. Typically, the coding region is<br>
bounded on the 5' side by the nucleotide triplet "ATG" which encodes the<br>
initiator methionine and on the 3' side by a stop codon (e.g., TAA, TAG, TGA).<br>
In some cases the coding region is also known to initiate by a nucleotide triplet<br>
"TTG".<br>
As used herein, the terms "isolated and/or purified" refer to in vitro<br>
preparation, isolation and/or purification of a nucleic acid molecule, a<br>
polypeptide, peptide or protein, so that it is not associated with in vivo<br>
substances. Thus, the term "isolated" when used in relation to a nucleic acid, as<br>
in "isolated oligonucleotide" or "isolated polynucleotide" refers to a nucleic acid<br>
sequence that is identified and separated from at least one contaminant with<br>
which it is ordinarily associated in its source. An isolated nucleic acid is present<br>
in a form or setting that is different from that in which it is found in nature. In<br>
contrast, non-isolated nucleic acids (e.g., DNA and RNA) are found in the state<br>
they exist in nature. For example, a given DNA sequence (e.g., a gene) is found<br>
on the host cell chromosome in proximity to neighboring genes; RNA sequences<br>
(e.g., a specific mRNA sequence encoding a specific protein), are found in the<br>
cell as a mixture with numerous other mRNAs that encode a multitude of<br>
proteins. Hence, with respect to an "isolated nucleic acid molecule", which<br>
includes a polynucleotide of genomic, cDNA, or synthetic origin or some<br>
combination thereof, the "isolated nucleic acid molecule" (1) is not associated<br>
with all or a portion of a polynucleotide in which the "isolated nucleic acid<br>
molecule" is found in nature, (2) is operably linked to a polynucleotide which it<br>
is not linked to in nature, or (3) does not occur in nature as part of a larger<br>
sequence. The isolated nucleic acid molecule may be present in single-stranded<br>
or double-stranded form. When a nucleic acid molecule is to be utilized to<br>
express a protein, the nucleic acid contains at a minimum, the sense or coding<br>
strand (i.e., the nucleic acid may be single-stranded), but may contain both the<br>
sense and anti-sense strands (i.e., the nucleic acid may be double-stranded).<br>
The term "wild-type" as used herein, refers to a gene or gene product that<br>
has the characteristics of that gene or gene product isolated from a naturally<br>
occurring source. A wild-type gene is that which is most frequently observed in<br>
a population and is thus arbitrarily designated the "wild-type" form of the gene.<br>
In contrast, the term "mutant" refers to a gene or gene product that displays<br>
modifications in sequence and/or functional properties (i.e., altered<br>
characteristics) when compared to the wild-type gene or gene product. It is<br>
noted that naturally-occurring mutants can be isolated; these are identified by the<br>
fact that they have altered characteristics when compared to the wild-type gene<br>
or gene product.<br>
The term "recombinant DNA molecule" means a hybrid DNA sequence<br>
comprising at least two nucleotide sequences not normally found together in<br>
nature. The term "vector" is used in reference to nucleic acid molecules<br>
into which fragments of DNA may be inserted or cloned and can be used to<br>
transfer DNA segments) into a cell and capable of replication in a cell. Vectors<br>
may be derived from plasmids, baoteriophages, viruses, cosmids, and the like.<br>
The terms "recombinant vector", "expression vector" or "construct" as<br>
used herein refer to DNA or RNA sequences containing a desired coding<br>
sequence and appropriate DNA or RNA sequences necessary for the expression<br>
of the operably linked coding sequence in a particular host organism.<br>
Prokaryotic expression vectors include a promoter, a ribosome binding site, an<br>
origin of replication for autonomous replication in a host cell and possibly other<br>
sequences, e.g. an optional operator sequence, optional restriction enzyme sites.<br>
A promoter is defined as a DNA sequence that directs RNA polymerase to bind<br>
to DNA and to initiate RNA synthesis. Eukaryotic expression vectors include a<br>
promoter, optionally a polyadenylation signal and optionally an enhancer<br>
sequence.<br>
A polynucleotide having a nucleotide sequence "encoding a peptide,<br>
protein or polypeptide" means a nucleic acid sequence comprising the coding<br>
region of a gene, or a fragment thereof which encodes a gene product having<br>
substantially the same activity as the corresponding full-length peptide, protein<br>
or polypeptide. The coding region may be present in either a cDNA, genomic<br>
DNA or RNA form. When present in a DNA form, the oligonucleotide may be<br>
single-stranded (i.e., the sense strand) or double-stranded. Suitable control<br>
elements such as enhancers/promoters, splice junctions, polyadenylation signals,<br>
etc. may be placed in close proximity to the coding region of the gene if needed<br>
to permit proper initiation of transcription and/or correct processing of the<br>
primary RNA transcript. Alternatively, the coding region utilized in the<br>
expression vectors of the present invention may contain endogenous<br>
enhancers/promoters, splice junctions, intervening sequences, polyadenylation<br>
signals, etc. In further embodiments, the coding region may contain a<br>
combination of both endogenous and exogenous control elements.<br>
The term "transcription regulatory element" or "transcription regulatory<br>
sequence" refers to a genetic element or sequence that controls some aspect of<br>
the expression of nucleic acid sequences). For example, a promoter is a<br>
regulatory element that facilitates the initiation of transcription of an operably<br>
linked coding region. Other regulatory elements include, but are not limited to,<br>
transcription factor binding sites, splicing signals, polyadenylation signals,<br>
termination signals and enhancer elements.<br>
Transcriptional control signals in eukaryotes comprise "promoter" and<br>
"enhancer" elements. Promoters and enhancers consist of short arrays of DNA<br>
sequences that interact specifically with cellular proteins involved in<br>
transcription. Promoter and enhancer elements have been isolated from a variety<br>
of eukaryotic sources including genes in yeast, insect and mammalian cells.<br>
Promoter and enhancer elements have also been isolated from viruses and<br><br>
analogous control elements, such as promoters, are also found in prokaryotes.<br>
The selection of a particular promoter and enhancer depends on the cell type<br>
used to express the protein of interest. Some eukaryotic promoters and<br>
enhancers have a broad host range while others are functional in a limited subset<br>
of cell types. For example, the SV40 early gene enhancer is very active in a<br>
wide variety of cell types from many mammalian species and has been widely<br>
used for the expression of proteins in mammalian cells. Two other examples of<br>
promoter/enhancer elements active in a broad range of mammalian cell types are<br>
those from the human elongation factor 1 gene (Uetsuki et al., 1989; Kim et al.,<br>
1990; and Mizushima and Nagata, 1990) and the long terminal repeats of the<br>
Rous sarcoma virus (Gorman et al., 1982); and the human cytomegalovirus<br>
(Boshart et al., 1985).<br>
The term "promoter/enhancer" denotes a segment of DNA containing<br>
sequences capable of providing both promoter and enhancer functions (i.e., the<br>
functions provided by a promoter element and an enhancer element as described<br>
above). For example, the long terminal repeats of retroviruses contain both<br>
promoter and enhancer functions. The enhancer/promoter may be "endogenous"<br>
or "exogenous" or "heterologous." An "endogenous" enhancer/promoter is one<br>
that is naturally linked with a given gene in the genome. An "exogenous" or<br>
"heterologous" enhancer/promoter is one that is placed in juxtaposition to a gene<br>
by means of genetic manipulation (i.e., molecular biological techniques) such<br>
that transcription of the gene is directed by the linked enhancer/promoter.<br>
The presence of "splicing signals" on an expression vector often results<br>
in higher levels of expression of the recombinant transcript in eukaryotic host<br>
cells. Splicing signals mediate the removal of introns from the primary RNA<br>
transcript and consist of a splice donor and acceptor site (Sambrook et al., 1989).<br>
A commonly used splice donor and acceptor site is the splice junction from the<br>
16SRNAofSV40.<br>
Efficient expression of recombinant DNA sequences in eukaryotic cells<br>
requires expression of signals directing the efficient termination and<br>
polyadenylation of the resulting transcript. Transcription termination signals are<br>
generally found downstream of the polyadenylation signal and are a few hundred<br>
nucleotides in length. The term "poly(A) site" or "poly(A) sequence" as used<br><br>
herein denotes a DNA sequence which directs both the termination and<br>
polyadenylation of the nascent RNA transcript. Efficient polyadenylation of the<br>
recombinant transcript is desirable, as transcripts lacking a poly(A) tail are<br>
unstable and are rapidly degraded. The poly(A) signal utilized in an expression<br>
vector may be "heterologous" or "endogenous." An endogenous poly(A) signal<br>
is one that is found naturally at the 3' end of the coding region of a given gene in<br>
the genome. A heterologous poly(A) signal is one which has been isolated from<br>
one gene and positioned 3' to another gene. A commonly used heterologous<br>
poly(A) signal is the SV40 poly(A) signal. The SV40 poly(A) signal is<br>
contained on a 237 bp BamH. IIBel I restriction fragment and directs both<br>
termination and polyadenylation (Sambrook et al., 1989).<br>
Eukaryotic expression vectors may also contain "viral replicons "or "viral<br>
origins of replication." Viral replicons are viral DNA sequences which allow for<br>
the extrachromosomal replication of a vector in a host cell expressing the<br>
appropriate replication factors. Vectors containing either the S V40 or polyoma<br>
virus origin of replication replicate to high copy number (up to 104 copies/cell)<br>
in cells that express the appropriate viral T antigen. In contrast, vectors<br>
containing the replicons from bovine papillomavirus or Epstein-Barr virus<br>
replicate extrachromosomally at low copy number (about 100 copies/cell).<br>
The term "in vitro" refers to an artificial environment and to processes or<br>
reactions that occur within an artificial environment. In vitro environments<br>
include, but are not limited to, test tubes and cell lysates. The term "in situ"<br>
refers to cell culture. The term "in vivo" refers to the natural environment (e.g.,<br>
an animal or a cell) and to processes or reaction that occur within a natural<br>
environment.<br>
The term "expression system" refers to any assay or system for<br>
determining (e.g., detecting) the expression of a gene of interest. Those skilled<br>
in the field of molecular biology will understand that any of a wide variety of<br>
expression systems may be used. A wide range of suitable mammalian cells are<br>
available from a wide range of sources (e.g., the American Type Culture<br>
Collection, Rockland, MD). The method of transformation or transfection and<br>
the choice of expression vehicle will depend on the host system selected.<br>
Transformation and transfection methods are described, e.g., in Sambrook et al.,<br>
1989. Expression systems include in vitro gene expression assays where a gene<br>
of interest (e.g., a reporter gene) is linked to a regulatory sequence and the<br>
expression of the gene is monitored following treatment with an agent that<br>
inhibits or induces expression of the gene. Detection of gene expression can be<br>
through any suitable means including, but not limited to, detection of expressed<br>
mRNA or protein (e.g., a detectable product of a reporter gene) or through a<br>
detectable change in the phenotype of a cell expressing the gene of interest.<br>
Expression systems may also comprise assays where a cleavage event or other<br>
nucleic acid or cellular change is detected.<br>
The term "gene" refers to a DNA sequence that comprises coding<br>
sequences and optionally control sequences necessary for the production of a<br>
polypeptide from the DNA sequence. The polypeptide can be encoded by a fulllength<br>
coding sequence or by any portion of the coding sequence so long as the<br>
portion encodes a gene product with substantially the same activity as the fulllength<br>
polypeptide.<br>
Nucleic acids are known to contain different types of mutations. A<br>
"point" mutation refers to an alteration in the sequence of a nucleotide at a single<br>
base position from the wild-type sequence. Mutations may also refer to insertion<br>
or deletion of one or more bases, so that the nucleic acid sequence differs from a<br>
reference, e.g., a wild-type, sequence.<br>
As used herein, the terms "hybridize" and "hybridization" refer to the<br>
annealing of a complementary sequence to the target nucleic acid, i.e., the ability<br>
of two polymers of nucleic acid (polynucleotides) containing complementary<br>
sequences to anneal through base pairing. The terms "annealed" and<br>
"hybridized" are used interchangeably throughout, and are intended to<br>
encompass any specific and reproducible interaction between a complementary<br>
sequence and a target nucleic acid, including binding of regions having only<br>
partial complementarity. Certain bases not commonly found in natural nucleic<br>
acids may be included in the nucleic acids of the present invention and include,<br>
for example, inosine and 7-deazaguanine. Those skilled in the art of nucleic acid<br>
technology can determine duplex stability empirically considering a number of<br>
variables including, for example, the length of the complementary sequence,<br>
base composition and sequence of the oligonucleotide, ionic strength and<br>
incidence of mismatched base pairs. The stability of a nucleic acid duplex is<br>
measured by the melting temperature, or "Tm". The Tm of a particular nucleic<br>
acid duplex under specified conditions is the temperature at which on average<br>
half of the base pairs have disassociated.<br>
The term "stringency" is used in reference to the conditions of<br>
temperature, ionic strength, and the presence of other compounds, under which<br>
nucleic acid hybridizations are conducted. With "high stringency" conditions,<br>
nucleic acid base pairing will occur only between nucleic acid fragments that<br>
have a high frequency of complementary base sequences. Thus, conditions of<br>
"medium" or "low" stringency are often required when it is desired that nucleic<br>
acids which are not completely complementary to one another be hybridized or<br>
annealed together. The art knows well that numerous equivalent conditions can<br>
be employed to comprise medium or low stringency conditions. The choice of<br>
hybridization conditions is generally evident to one skilled in the art and is<br>
usually guided by the purpose of the hybridization, the type of hybridization<br>
(DNA-DNA or DNA-RNA), and the level of desired relatedness between the<br>
sequences (e.g., Sambrook et al., 1989; Nucleic Acid Hybridization, A Practical<br>
Approach, IRL Press, Washington D.C., 1985, for a general discussion of the<br>
methods).<br>
The stability of nucleic acid duplexes is known to decrease with an<br>
increased number of mismatched bases, and further to be decreased to a greater<br>
or lesser degree depending on the relative positions of mismatches in the hybrid<br>
duplexes. Thus, the stringency of hybridization can be used to maximize or<br>
minimize stability of such duplexes. Hybridization stringency can be altered by:<br>
adjusting the temperature of hybridization; adjusting the percentage of helix<br>
destabilizing agents, such as formamide, in the hybridization mix; and adjusting<br>
the temperature and/or salt concentration of the wash solutions. For filter<br>
hybridizations, the final stringency of hybridizations often is determined by the<br>

By "peptide", "protein" and "polypeptide" is meant any chain of amino<br>
acids, regardless of length or post-translational modification (e.g., glycosylation<br>
or phosphorylation). Unless otherwise specified, the terms are interchangeable.<br>
The nucleic acid molecules of the invention encode a variant (mutant) of a<br>
naturally-occurring (wild-type) protein or fragment thereof which has<br>
substantially the same activity as the full length mutant protein. Preferably, such<br>
a mutant protein has an amino acid sequence that is at least 85%, preferably<br>
90%, and most preferably 95% or 99%, identical to the amino acid sequence of a<br>
corresponding wild-type protein.<br>
Polypeptide molecules are said to have an "amino terminus"<br>
(N-terminus) and a "carboxy terminus" (C-terminus) because peptide linkages<br>
occur between the backbone amino group of a first amino acid residue and the<br>
backbone carboxyl group of a second amino acid residue. The terms<br>
"N-terminal" and "C-terminal" in reference to polypeptide sequences refer to<br>
regions of polypeptides including portions of the N-terminal and C-terminal<br>
regions of the polypeptide, respectively. A sequence that includes a portion of<br>
the N-terminal region of polypeptide includes amino acids predominantly from<br>
the N-terminal half of the polypeptide chain, but is not limited to such<br>
sequences. For example, an N-terminal sequence may include an interior portion<br>
of the polypeptide sequence including bases from both the N-terminal and<br>
C-terminal halves of the polypeptide. The same applies to C-terminal regions.<br>
N-terminal and C-terminal regions may, but need not, include the amino acid<br>
defining the ultimate N-terminus and C-terminus of the polypeptide,<br>
respectively.<br>
The term "isolated" when used in relation to a polypeptide, as in "isolated<br>
protein" or "isolated poiypeptide" refers to a polypeptide that is identified and<br>
separated from at least one contaminant with which it is ordinarily associated in<br>
its source. Thus, an isolated polypeptide (1) is not associated with proteins<br>
found in nature, (2) is free of other proteins from the same source, e.g., free of<br>
human proteins, (3) is expressed by a cell from a different species, or (4) does<br>
not occur in nature. In contrast, non-isolated polypeptides (e.g., proteins and<br>
enzymes) are found in the state they exist in nature. The .terms "isolated<br>
polypeptide", "isolated peptide" or "isolated protein" include a polypeptide,<br>
peptide or protein encoded by cDNA or recombinant RNA including one of<br>
synthetic origin, or some combination thereof.<br>
The term "recombinant protein" or "recombinant polypeptide" as used<br>
herein refers to a protein molecule expressed from a recombinant DNA<br>
molecule. In contrast, the term "native protein" is used herein to indicate a<br>
protein isolated from a naturally occurring (i.e., a nonrecombinant) source.<br>
Molecular biological techniques may be used to produce a recombinant form of<br>
a protein with identical properties as compared to the native form of the protein.<br>
The term "fusion polypeptide" as used herein refers to a chimeric protein<br>
containing a protein of interest (e.g., luciferase, an affinity tag or a targeting<br>
sequence) joined to a different protein, e.g., a mutant hydrolase.<br>
As used herein, the term "antibody" refers to a protein having one or<br>
more polypeptides substantially encoded by immunoglobulin genes or fragments<br>
of immunoglobulin genes. The recognized immunoglobulin genes include the<br>
kappa, lambda, alpha, gamma, delta, epsilon and mu constant region genes, as<br>
well as the myriad of immunoglobulin variable region genes. Light chains are<br>
classified as either kappa or lambda. Heavy chains are classified as gamma, mu,<br>
alpha, delta, or epsilon, which in turn define the immunoglobulin classes, IgG,<br>
IgM, IgA, IgD and IgE, respectively.<br>
The basic immunoglobulin (antibody) structural unit is known to<br>
comprise a tetramer. Each tetramer is composed of two identical pairs of<br>
polypeptide chains, each pah: having one "light" (about 25 kD) and one "heavy"<br>
chain (about 50-70 kD). The N-terminus of each chain defines a variable region<br>
of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen<br>
recognition. The terms variable light chain (Vz) and variable heavy chain (V/y)<br>
refer to these light and heavy chains respectively.<br>
Antibodies may exist as intact immunoglobulins, or as modifications hi a<br>
variety of forms including, for example, FabFcz, Fab, Fv, Fd, (Fab')2» an Fv<br>
fragment containing only the light and heavy chain variable regions, a Fab or<br>
(Fab)'2 fragment containing the variable regions and parts of the constant<br>
regions, a single-chain antibody, e.g., scFv, CDR-grafted antibodies and the like.<br>
The heavy and light chain of a Fv may be derived from the same antibody or<br>
different antibodies thereby producing a chimeric Fv region. The antibody may<br>
be of animal (especially mouse or rat) or human origin or may be chimeric or<br>
humanized. As used herein the term "antibody" includes these various forms.<br>
The terms "cell," "cell line," "host cell," as used herein, are used<br>
interchangeably, 'and all such designations include progeny or potential progeny<br>
of these designations. By "transformed cell" is meant a cell into which (or into<br>
an ancestor of which) has been introduced a nucleic acid molecule of the<br>
invention. Optionally, a nucleic acid molecule of the invention may be<br>
introduced into a suitable cell line so as to create a stably transfected cell line<br>
capable of producing the protein or polypeptide encoded by the nucleic acid<br>
molecule. Vectors, cells, and methods for constructing such cell lines are well<br>
known in the art. The words "transformants" or "transformed cells" include the<br>
primary transformed cells derived from the originally transformed cell without<br>
regard to the number of transfers. All progeny may not be precisely identical in<br>
DNA content, due to deliberate or inadvertent mutations. Nonetheless, mutant<br>
progeny that have the same functionality as screened for in the originally<br>
transformed cell are included hi the definition of transformants.<br>
The term "homology" refers to a degree of complementarity. There may<br>
be partial homology or complete homology (i.e., identity). Homology is often<br>
measured using sequence analysis software (e.g., Sequence Analysis Software<br>
Package of the Genetics Computer Group. University of Wisconsin<br>
Biotechnology Center. 1710 University Avenue. Madison, WI 53705). Such<br>
software matches similar sequences by assigning degrees of homology to various<br>
substitutions, deletions, insertions, and other modifications. Conservative<br>
substitutions typically include substitutions within the following groups:<br>
glvcine, alanine; valine, isoleucine, leucine; aspartic acid, glutamic acid,<br>
asparagine, glutamine; serine, threonine; lysine, arginine; and phenylalanine,<br>
tyrosine.<br>
The term "purified" or "to purify" means the result of any process that<br>
removes some of a contaminant from the component of interest, such as a<br>
protein or nucleic acid. The percent of a purified component is thereby<br>
increased in the sample.<br>
The term "operably linked" as used herein refer to the linkage of nucleic<br>
acid sequences in such a manner that a nucleic acid molecule capable of<br>
directing the transcription of a given gene and/or the synthesis of a desired<br>
protein molecule is produced. The term also refers to the Linkage of sequences<br>
encoding amino acids in such a manner that a functional (e.g., enzymatically<br>
active, capable of binding to a binding partner, capable of inhibiting, etc.)<br>
protein or polypeptide, or a precursor thereof, e.g., the pre- or prepro-form of the<br>
protein or polypeptide, is produced.<br>
All amino acid residues identified herein are in the natural<br>
L-configuration. In keeping with standard polypeptide nomenclature,<br>
abbreviations for amino acid residues are as shown in the following Table of<br>
Correspondence.<br>

As used herein, the term "poly-histidine tract" or (His tag) refers to a<br>
molecule comprising two to ten histidine residues, e.g., a poly-histidine tract of<br>
five to ten residues. A poly-histidine tract allows the affinity purification of a<br>
covalently linked molecule on an immobilized metal, e.g., nickel, zinc, cobalt or<br>
copper, chelate column or through an interaction with another molecule (e.g., an<br>
antibody reactive with the His tag).<br>
As used herein, "pure" means an object species is the predominant<br>
species present (i.e., on a molar basis it is more abundant than any other<br>
individual species in the composition), and preferably a substantially purified<br>
fraction is a composition wherein the object species comprises at least about 50<br>
percent (on a molar basis) of all macromolecular species present. Generally, a<br>
"substantially pure" composition will comprise more than about 80 percent of all<br>
macromolecular species present in the composition, more preferably more than<br>
about 85%, about 90%, about 95%, and about 99%. Most preferably, the object<br>
species is purified to essential homogeneity (contaminant species cannot be<br>
detected in the composition by conventional detection methods) wherein the<br>
composition consists essentially of a single macromolecular species.<br>
I. Mutant Hvdrolases and Fusions ^hereof<br>

limited to those prepared via recombinant techniques, e.g., site-directed<br>

myristilation sequence.<br>
II. Optimized Hvdrolase Sequences, and Vectors and Host Cells Encoding<br>
the Hvdrolase<br>
A nucleic acid molecule comprising a nucleic acid sequence encoding a<br>
hydrolase or a fusion thereof is optionally optimized for expression in a<br>
particular host cell and also optionally operably linked to transcription regulatory<br>
sequences, e.g., one or more enhancers, a promoter, a transcription termination<br>
sequence or a combination thereof, to form an expression cassette.<br>
In one embodiment, a nucleic acid sequence encoding a hydrolase or a<br>
fusion thereof is optimized by replacing codons in a wild-type or mutant<br>
hydrolase sequence with codons which are preferentially employed in a<br>
particular (selected) cell. Preferred codons have a relatively high codon usage<br>
frequency in a selected cell, and preferably their introduction results in the<br>
introduction of relatively few transcription factor binding sites for transcription<br>
factors present in the selected host cell, and relatively few other undesirable<br>
structural attributes. Thus, the optimized nucleic acid product has an improved<br>
level of expression due to improved codon usage frequency, and a reduced risk<br>
of inappropriate transcriptional behavior due to a reduced number of undesirable<br>
transcription regulatory sequences.<br>
An isolated and optimized nucleic acid molecule of the invention may<br>
have a codon composition that differs from that of the corresponding wild-type<br>
nucleic acid sequence at more than 30%, 35%, 40% or more than 45%, e.g.,<br>
50%, 55%, 60% or more of the codons. Preferred codons for use in the<br>
invention are those which are employed more frequently than at least one other<br>
codon for the same amino acid in a particular organism and, more preferably, are<br>
also not low-usage codons in that organism and are not low-usage codons in the<br>
organism used to clone or screen for the expression of the nucleic acid molecule.<br>
Moreover, preferred codons for certain amino acids (i.e., those amino acids that<br>
have three or more codons), may include two or more codons that are employed<br>
more frequently than the other (non-preferred) codon(s). The presence of<br>
codons in the nucleic acid molecule that are employed more frequently in one<br>
organism than in another organism results hi a nucleic acid molecule which,<br>
when introduced into the cells of the organism that employs those codons more<br>
frequently, is expressed in those cells at a level that is greater than the expression<br>
of the wild-type or parent nucleic acid sequence in those cells.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the codons that are different are<br>
those employed more frequently in a mammal, while in another embodiment the<br>
codons that are different are those employed more frequently in a plant.<br>
Preferred codons for different organisms are known to the art, e.g., see<br>
www.ka2fusft.or.jp./codon/. A particular type of mammal, e.g., a human, may<br>
have a different set of preferred codons than another type of mammal. Likewise,<br>
a particular type of plant may have a different set of preferred codons than<br>
another type of plant. In one embodiment of the invention, the majority of the<br>
codons that differ are ones that are preferred codons in a desired host cell.<br>
Preferred codons for organisms including mammals (e.g., humans) and plants are<br>
known to the art (e.g., Wada et al., 1990; Ausubel et al., 1997). For example,<br>
preferred human codons include, but are not limited to, CGC (Arg), CTG (Leu),<br>
TCT (Ser), AGC (Ser), ACC (Thr), CCA (Pro), CCT (Pro), GCC (Ala), GGC<br>
(Gly), GTG (Val), ATC (De), ATT (He), AAG (Lys), AAC (Asn), CAG (Gin),<br>
CAC (His), GAG (Glu), GAC (Asp), TAC (Tyr), TGC (Cys) and TTC (Phe)<br>
(Wada et al., 1990). Thus, in one embodiment, synthetic nucleic acid molecules<br>
of the invention have a codon composition which differs from a wild type<br>
nucleic acid sequence by having an increased number of the preferred human<br>
codons, e.g., CGC, CTG, TCT, AGC, ACC, CCA, CCT, GCC, GGC, GTG,<br>
ATC, ATT, AAG, AAC, CAG, CAC, GAG, GAC, TAC, TGC, TTC, or any<br>
combination thereof. For example, the nucleic acid molecule of the invention<br>
may have an increased number of CTG or TTG leucine-encoding codons, GTG<br>
or GTC valine-encoding codons, GGC or GOT glycine-encoding codons, ATC<br>
or ATT isoleucine-encoding codons, CCA or CCT proline-encoding codons,<br>
CGC or CGT arginine-encoding codons, AGC or TCT serine-encoding codons,<br>
ACC or ACT threonine-encoding codon, GCC or GCT alanine-encoding codons,<br>
or any combination thereof, relative to the wild-type nucleic acid sequence, hi<br>
another embodiment, preferred C. elegans codons include, but are not limited, to<br>
UUC (Phe), UUU (Phe), CUU (Leu), UUG (Leu), AUU (He), GUU (Val), GUG<br>
(Val), UCA (Ser), UCU (Ser), CCA (Pro), ACA (Thr), ACU (Thr), GCU (Ala),<br>
GCA (Ala), UAU (Tyr), CAU (His), CAA (Gin), AAU (Asn), AAA (Lys), GAU<br>
(Asp), GAA (Glu), UGU (Cys), AGA (Arg), CGA (Arg), CGU (Arg), GGA<br>
(Gly), or any combination thereof. In yet another embodiment, preferred<br>
Drosophilia codons include, but are not limited to, UUC (Phe), CUG (Leu),<br>
CUC (Leu), AUC (He), AUU (He), GUG (Val), GUC (Val), AGC (Ser), UCC<br>
(Ser), CCC (Pro), CCG (Pro), ACC (Thr), ACG (Thr), GCC (Ala), GCU (Ala),<br>
UAC (Tyr), CAC (His), CAG (Gin), AAC (Asn), AAG (Lys), GAU (Asp), GAG<br>
 (Glu), UGC (Cys), COG (Arg), GGC (Gly), GGA (gly), or any combination<br>
thereof. Preferred yeast codons include but are not limited to UUU (Phe), UUG<br>
(Leu), UUA (Leu), CCU (Leu), AUU (He), GUU (Val), UCU (Ser), UCA (Ser),<br>
CCA (Pro), CCU (Pro), ACU (Thr), ACA (Thr), GCU (Ala), GCA (Ala), UAU<br>
(Tyr), UAC (Tyr), CAU (His), CAA (Gin), AAU (Asn), AAC (Asn), AAA<br>
(Lys), AAG (Lys), GAU (Asp), GAA (Glu), GAG (Glu), UGU (Cys), CGU<br>
(Tip), AGA (Arg), CGU (Axg), GGU (Gly), GGA (Gly), or any combination<br>
thereof. Similarly, nucleic acid molecules having an increased number of<br>
codons that are employed more frequently in plants, have a codon composition<br>
which differs from a wild-type or parent nucleic acid sequence by having an<br>
increased number of the plant codons including, but not limited to, CGC (Arg),<br>
CTT (Leu), TCT (Ser), TCC (Ser), ACC (Thr), CCA (Pro), CCT (Pro), GCT<br>
(Ser), GGA (Gly), GTG (Val), ATC (lie), ATT (He), AAG (Lys), AAC (Asn),<br>
CAA (Gin), CAC (His), GAG (Glu), GAC (Asp), TAG (Tyr), TGC (Cys), TTC<br>
(Phe), or any combination thereof (Murray et al., 1989). Preferred codons may<br>
differ for different types of plants (Wada et al., 1990).<br>
In one embodiment, an optimized nucleic acid sequence encoding a<br>
hydrolase or fusion thereof has less than 100%, e.g., less man 90% or less than<br>
80%, nucleic acid sequence identity relative to a non-optimized nucleic acid<br>
sequence encoding a corresponding hydrolase or fusion thereof. For instance,<br>
an optimized nucleic acid sequence encoding DhaA has less than about 80%<br>
nucleic acid sequence identity relative to non-optimized (wild-type) nucleic acid<br>
sequence encoding a corresponding DhaA, and the DhaA encoded by the<br>
optimized nucleic acid sequence optionally has at least 85% amino acid<br>
sequence identity to a corresponding wild-type DhaA. In one embodiment, the<br>
activity of a DhaA encoded by the optimized nucleic acid sequence is at least<br>
10%, e.g., 50% or more, of the activity of a DhaA encoded by the non-optimized<br>
sequence, e.g., a mutant DhaA encoded by the optimized nucleic acid sequence<br>
binds a substrate with substantially the same efficiency, i.e., at least 50%, 80%,<br>
100% or more, as the mutant DhaA encoded by the non-optimized nucleic acid<br>
sequence binds the same substrate.<br>
The nucleic acid molecule or expression cassette may be introduced to a<br>
vector, e.g., a plasmid or viral vector, which optionally includes a selectable<br>
marker gene, and the vector introduced to a cell of interest, for example, a<br>
prokaryotic cell such as E. coli, Streptomyces spp., Bacillus spp., Staphylococcus<br>
spp. and the like, as well as eukaryotic cells including a plant (dicot or monocot),<br>
fungus, yeast, e.g., Pichia, Saccharomyces or Schizosaccharomyces, or<br>
mammalian cell. Preferred mammalian cells include bovine, caprine, ovine,<br>
canine, feline, non-human primate, e.g., simian, and human cells. Preferred<br>
mammalian cell lines include, but are not limited to, CHO, COS, 293, Hela, CV-<br>
1, SH-SY5Y (human neuroblastoma cells), HEK293, and NIH3T3 cells.<br>
The expression of the encoded mutant hydrolase may be controlled by<br>

III. Functional Groups<br>
Functional groups useful in the substrates and methods of the invention<br>
are molecules that are detectable or capable of detection. A functional group<br>
within the scope of the invention is capable of being covalently linked to one<br>
reactive substituent of a Wfunctional linker or a substrate for a hydrolase, and, as<br>
part of a substrate of the invention, has substantially the same activity as a<br>
functional group which is not linked to a substrate found in nature and is capable<br>
of forming a stable complex with a mutant hydrolase. Functional groups thus<br>
have one or more properties that facilitate detection, and optionally the isolation,<br>
of stable complexes between a substrate having that functional group and a<br>
mutant hydrolase. For instance, functional groups include those with a<br>
characteristic electromagnetic spectral property such as emission or absorbance,<br>
magnetism, electron spin resonance, electrical capacitance, dielectric constant or<br>
electrical conductivity as well as fiinctional groups which are ferromagnetic,<br>
paramagnetic, diamagnetic, luminescent, electrochemiluminescent, fluorescent,<br>
phosphorescent, chromatic, antigenic, or have a distinctive mass. A functional<br>
group includes, but is not limited to, a nucleic acid molecule, i.e., DNA or RNA,<br>
e.g., an oligonucleotide or nucleotide, a protein, e.g., a luminescent protein, a<br>
peptide, for instance, an epitope recognized by a ligand, e.g., biotin or ^<br>
streptavidin, a hapten, an amino acid, a lipid, a lipid bilayer, a solid support, a<br>
fluorophore, a chromophore, a reporter molecule, a radionuclide, an electron<br>
opaque molecule, a MRI contrast agent, e.g., manganese, gadolinium (III) or<br>
iron-oxide particles, and the like. Methods to detect a particular functional<br>
group are known to the art For example, a nucleic acid molecule can be<br>
detected by hybridization, amplification, binding to a nucleic acid binding<br>
protein specific for the nucleic acid molecule, enzymatic assays (e.g., if the<br>
nucleic acid molecule is a ribozyme), or, if the nucleic acid molecule itself<br>
comprises a molecule which is detectable or capable of detection, for instance, a<br>
radiolabel or biotin, it can be detected by an assay suitable for that molecule.<br>
Exemplary functional groups include haptens, e.g., molecules useful to<br>
enhance immunogenicity such as keyhole limpet hemacyanin (KLH), cleavable<br>
labels, for instance, photocleavable biotin, and fluorescent labels, e.g., Nhydroxysuccinimide<br>
(NHS) modified coumarin and succinimide or<br>
sulfonosuccinimide modified BODIPY (which can be detected by UV and/or<br>
visible excited fluorescence detection), rhodamine, e.g., Rl 10, rhodols, CRG6,<br>
Texas Methyl Red (TAMRA), Rox5, FAM, or fluoroscein, coumarin derivatives,<br>
e.g., 7 aminocoumarin, and 7-hydroxycoumarin, 2-amino-4-methoxynapthalene,<br>
1-hydroxypyrene, resorufin, phenalenones or benzphenalenones (U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,812,409), acridinones (U.S. Patent No. 4,810,636), anthracenes, and<br>
derivatives of a- and p-napthol, fluorinated xanthene derivatives including<br>
fluorinated fluoresceins and rhodols (e.g., U.S. Patent No. 6,162,931), and<br>
bioluminescent molecules, e.g., luciferase or GFP. A fluorescent (or<br>
bioluminescent) functional group linked to a mutant hydrolase by virtue of being<br>
linked to a substrate for a corresponding wild-type hydrolase, may be used to<br>
sense changes in a system, like phosphorylation, in real time. Moreover, a<br>
fluorescent molecule, such as a chemosensor of metal ions, e.g., a 9-<br>
carbonylanthracene modified glycyl-histidyl-lysine (GHK) for Cu2+, in a<br>
substrate of the invention may be employed to label proteins which bind the<br>
substrate. A bioluminescent or fluorescent functional group such as BODIPY,<br>
rhodamine green, GFP, or infrared dyes, also finds use as a functional group and<br>
may, for instance, be employed in interaction studies, e.g., using BRET, FRET,<br>
LRET or electrophoresis.<br>
Another class of functional group is a molecule that selectively interacts<br>
with molecules containing acceptor groups (an "affinity" molecule). Thus, a<br>
substrate for a hydrolase which includes an affinity molecule can facilitate the<br>
separation of complexes having such a substrate and a mutant hydrolase, because<br>
of the selective interaction of the affinity molecule with another molecule, e.g.,<br>
an acceptor molecule, that may be biological or non-biological in origin. For<br>
example, the specific molecule with which the affinity molecule interacts<br>
(referred to as the acceptor molecule) could be a small organic molecule, a<br>
chemical group such as a sulfhydryl group (-SH) or a large biomolecule such as<br>
an antibody or other naturally occurring ligand for the affinity molecule. The<br>
binding is normally chemical in nature and may involve the formation of<br>
covalent or non-covalent bonds or interactions such as ionic or hydrogen<br>
bonding. The acceptor molecule might be free hi solution or itself bound to a<br>
solid or semi-solid surface, a polymer matrix, or reside on the surface of a solid<br>
or semi-solid substrate. The interaction may also be triggered by an external<br>
agent such as light, temperature, pressure or the addition of a chemical or<br>
biological molecule that acts as a catalyst. The detection and/or separation of the<br>
complex from the reaction mixture occurs because of the interaction, normally a<br>
type of binding, between the affinity molecule and the acceptor molecule.<br>
Examples of affinity molecules include molecules such as immunogenic<br>
molecules, e.g., epitopes of proteins, peptides, carbohydrates or lipids, i.e., any<br>
molecule which is useful to prepare antibodies specific for that molecule; biotin,<br>
avidin, streptavidin, and derivatives thereof; metal binding molecules; and<br>
fragments and combinations of these molecules. Exemplary affinity molecules<br>
include His5 (HHHHH) (SEQ ID NO:19), HisX6 (HHHHHH) (SEQ ID NO:20),<br>
C-myc (EQKLISEEDL) (SEQ ID NO:21), Flag (DYKDDDDK) (SEQ ID<br>
N0:22), SteptTag (WSHPQFEK) (SEQ ID NO:23), HA Tag (YPYDWDYA)<br>
(SEQ ID NO:24), thioredoxin, cellulose binding domain, chitin binding domain,<br>
S-peptide, T7 peptide, calmodulin binding peptide, C-end KNA tag, metal<br>
binding domains, metal binding reactive groups, amino acid reactive groups,<br>
inteins, biotin, streptavidin, and maltose binding protein. For example, a<br>
substrate for a hydrolase which includes biotin is contacted with a mutant<br>
hydrolase. The presence of the biotin in a complex between the mutant<br>
hydrolase and the substrate permits selective binding of the complex to avidin<br>
molecules, e.g., streptavidin molecules coated onto a surface, e.g., beads,<br>
microwells, nitrocellulose and the like. Suitable surfaces include resins for<br>
chromatographic separation, plastics such as tissue culture surfaces or binding<br>
plates, microtiter dishes and beads, ceramics and glasses, particles including<br>
magnetic particles, polymers and other matrices. The treated surface is washed<br>
with, for example, phosphate buffered saline (PBS), to remove molecules that<br>
lack biotin and the biotin-containing complexes isolated. In some case these<br>
materials maybe part of biomolecular sensing devices such as optical fibers,<br>
chemfets, and plasmon detectors.<br>
Another example of an affinity molecule is dansyllysine. Antibodies<br>
which interact with the dansyl ring are commercially available (Sigma Chemical;<br>
St. Louis, MO) or can be prepared using known protocols such as described in<br>
Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual (Harlow and Lane, 1988). For example, the<br>
anti-dansyl antibody is immobilized onto the packing material of a<br>
chromatographic column. This method, affinity column chromatography,<br>
accomplishes separation by causing the complex between a mutant hydrolase<br>
and a substrate of the invention to be retained on the column due to its<br>
interaction with the immobilized antibody, while other molecules pass through<br>
the column. The complex may then be released by disrupting the antibodyantigen<br>
interaction. Specific chromatographic column materials such as ionexchange<br>
or affinity Sepharose, Sephacryl, Sephadex and other chromatography<br>
resins are commercially available (Sigma Chemical; St. Louis, MO; Pharmacia<br>
Biotech; Piscataway, N.J.). Dansyllysine may conveniently be detected because<br>
of its fluorescent properties.<br>
When employing an antibody as an acceptor molecule, separation can<br>
also be performed through other biochemical separation methods such as<br>
immunoprecipitation and immobilization of antibodies on filters or other<br>
surfaces such as beads, plates or resins. For example, complexes of a mutant<br>
hydrolase and a substrate of the invention may be isolated by coating magnetic<br>
beads with an affinity molecule-specific or a hydrolase-specific antibody. Beads<br>
are oftentimes separated from the mixture using magnetic fields.<br>
Another class of functional molecules includes molecules detectable<br>
using electromagnetic radiation and includes but is not limited to xanthene<br>
fluorophores, dansyl fluorophores, coumarins and coumarin derivatives,<br>
fluorescent acridinium moieties, benzopyrene based fluorophores, as well as 7-<br>
nitrobenz-2-oxa-l,3-diazole, and 3-N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-l,3-diazol-4-yl)-2,3-<br>
diamino-propionic acid. Preferably, the fluorescent molecule has a high<br>
quantum yield of fluorescence at a wavelength different from native amino acids<br>
and more preferably has high quantum yield of fluorescence that can be excited<br>
in the visible, or in both the UV and visible, portion of the spectrum. Upon<br>
excitation at a preselected wavelength, the molecule is detectable at low<br>
concentrations either visually or using conventional fluorescence detection<br>
methods. Electrochemiluminescent molecules such as ruthenium chelates and its<br>
derivatives or nitroxide amino acids and their derivatives are detectable at<br>
femtomolar ranges and below.<br>
In addition to fluorescent molecules, a variety of molecules with physical<br>
properties based on the interaction and response of the molecule to<br>
electromagnetic fields and radiation can be used to detect complexes between a<br>
mutant hydrolase and a substrate of the invention. These properties include<br>
absorption in the UV, visible and infrared regions of the electromagnetic<br>
spectrum, presence of chromophores which are Raman active, and can be further<br>
enhanced by resonance Raman spectroscopy, electron spin resonance activity<br>
and nuclear magnetic resonances and molecular mass, e.g., via a mass<br>
spectrometer.<br>
Methods to detect and/or isolate complexes having affinity molecules<br>
include chromatographic techniques including gel filtration, fast-pressure or<br>
high-pressure liquid chromatography, reverse-phase chromatography, affinity<br>
chromatography and ion exchange chromatography. Other methods of protein<br>
separation are also useful for detection and subsequent isolation of complexes<br>
between a mutant hydrolase and a substrate of the invention, for example,<br>
electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing and mass spectrometry.<br>

natural and unnatural amino acids bearing a conventional amino protecting<br>
group (e.g., acetyl or benzyloxycarbonyl), as well as natural and unnatural amino<br>
acids protected at the carboxy terminus (e.g. as a (Ci-C6)alkyl, phenyl or benzyl<br>
ester or amide). Other suitable amino and carboxy protecting groups are known<br>
to those skilled in the art (see for example, Greene, Protecting Groups In<br>
Organic Synthesis; Wiley: New York, 1981, and references cited therein). An<br>
amino acid can be linked to another molecule through the carboxy terminus, the<br>
amino terminus, or through any other convenient point of attachment, such as,<br>
for example, through the sulfur of cysteine.<br>
The term "peptide" when used with reference to a linker, describes a<br>
sequence of 2 to 25 amino acids (e.g. as defined hereinabove) or peptidyl<br>
residues. The sequence may be linear or cyclic. For example, a cyclic peptide<br>
can be prepared or may result from the formation of disulfide bridges between<br>
two cysteine residues in a sequence. A peptide can be linked to another<br>
molecule through the carboxy terminus, the amino terminus, or through any<br>
other convenient point of attachment, such as, for example, through the sulfur of<br>
a cysteine. Preferably a peptide comprises 3 to 25, or 5 to 21 amino acids.<br>
Peptide derivatives can be prepared as disclosed in U.S. Patent Numbers<br>
4,612,302; 4,853,371; and 4,684,620. Peptide sequences specifically recited<br>
herein are written with the amino terminus on the left and the carboxy terminus<br>

In one embodiment, a substrate of the invention for a dehalogenase<br>
which has a linker has the formula (I):<br>

including microspheres, membranes, glass beads, and the like), wherein the<br>
linker is<br>
a multiatom straight or branched'chain including C, N, S, or O, wherein A-X is a<br>
substrate for a dehalogenase, and wherein X is a halogen. In one embodiment,<br>
A-X is a haloaliphatic or haloaromatic substrate for a dehalogenase. In one<br>
embodiment, the linker is a divalent branched or unbranched carbon chain<br>
comprising from about 12 to about 30 carbon atoms, which chain optionally<br>

is optionally substituted with one or more (e.g., 2,3, or 4) hydroxy or oxo (=O)<br>
groups, wherein one or more (e.g., 1,2,3, or 4) of the carbon atoms in the chain<br>
is optionally replaced with a non-peroxide -O-, -S- or -NH-. In one embodiment,<br>
A is CHaCHj or CKfeCHbCHj. In one embodiment, a linker in a substrate for a<br>
dehalogenase such as a Rhodococcus dehalogenase, is a multiatom straight or<br>
branched chain including C, N, S, or O, and preferably 11-30 atoms when the<br>
functional group R includes an aromatic ring system or is a solid support.<br>

functional groups, such as a fluorophore, biotin, luminophore, or a fluorogenic or<br>
luminogenic molecule, or is a solid support, including microspheres,<br>
membranes, glass beads, and the like. When R is a radiolabel, or a small<br>
detectable atom such as a spectroscopically active isotope, the linker can be 0-30<br>
atoms.<br>

VI. Exemplary Methods of Use<br>
The invention provides methods to monitor the expression, location<br>
and/or trafficking of molecules in a cell, as well as to monitor changes in<br>
microenvironments within a cell. In one embodiment, a mutant hydrolase and a<br>
corresponding substrate which includes a functional group are employed to label<br>
a cell, e.g., a cell in an organism or cell culture, or a cellular component. For<br>
instance, cells are contacted with a vector encoding the mutant hydrolase, such<br>
as one encoding a fusion between the mutant hydrolase and a nuclear<br>
localization signal. The expression of the vector in the cell may be transient or<br>
stable. Then the cell is contacted with a substrate of the invention recognized by<br>
the mutant hydrolase. Alternatively, cells are concurrently contacted with the<br>
vector and the substrate. Then the presence or location of the functional group<br>
of the substrate in the cell, a lysate thereof, or a subcellular fraction thereof, is<br>
detected or determined.<br>
The substrates of the invention are preferably soluble in an aqueous or<br>
mostly aqueous solution, including water and aqueous solutions having a pH<br>
greater than or equal to about 6. Stock solutions of substrates of the invention,<br>
however, may be dissolved in organic solvent before diluting into aqueous<br>
solution or buffer. Preferred organic solvents are aprotic polar solvents such as<br>
DMSO, DMF, N-methylpyrrolidone, acetone, acetonitrile, dioxane,<br>
tetrahydrofuran and other nonhydroxylic, completely water-miscible solvents. In<br>
general, the amount of substrate of the invention employed is the minimum<br>
amount required to detect the presence of the functional group in the sample<br>
comprising a mutant hydrolase or a fusion thereof, within a reasonable time,<br>
with minimal background or undesirable labeling. The exact concentration of a<br>
substrate of the invention and a corresponding mutant hydrolase to be used is<br>
dependent upon the experimental conditions and the desired results. The<br>
concentration of a substrate of the invention typically ranges from nanomolar to<br>
micromolar. The required concentration for the substrate of the invention with a<br>
corresponding mutant hydrolase is determined by systematic variation in<br>
substrate until satisfactory labeling is accomplished. The starting ranges are<br>
readily determined from methods known in the art.<br>
In one embodiment, a substrate which includes a functional group with<br>
optical properties is employed with a mutant hydrolase to label a sample. Such a<br>
substrate is combined with the sample of interest comprising the mutant<br>
hydrolase for a period of time sufficient for the mutant hydrolase to bind the<br>
substrate, after which the sample is illuminated at a wavelength selected to elicit<br>
the optical response of the functional group. Optionally, the sample is washed to<br>
remove residual, excess or unbound substrate. In one embodiment, the labeling<br>
is used to determine a specified characteristic of the sample by further<br>
comparing the optical response with a standard or expected response. For<br>
example, the mutant hydrolase bound substrate is used to monitor specific<br>
components of the sample with respect to their spatial and temporal distribution<br>
in the sample. Alternatively, the mutant hydrolase bound substrate is employed<br>
to determine or detect the presence or quantity of a certain molecule. In another<br>
embodiment, the mutant hydrolase bound substrate is used to analyze the sample<br>
for the presence of a molecule that responds specifically to the functional group.<br>
A detectable optical response means a change in, or occurrence of, a<br>
parameter in a test system that is capable of being perceived, either by direct<br>
observation or instrumentally. Such detectable responses include the change in,<br>
or appearance of, color, fluorescence, reflectance, chemiluminescence, light<br>
polarization, light scattering, or x-ray scattering. Typically the detectable<br>
response is a change in fluorescence, such as a change in the intensity, excitation<br>
or emission wavelength distribution of fluorescence, fluorescence lifetime,<br>
fluorescence polarization, or a combination thereof. The detectable optical<br>
response may occur throughout the sample comprising a mutant hydrolase or a<br>
fusion thereof or in a localized portion of the sample comprising a mutant<br>
hydrolase or a fusion thereof. Comparison of the degree of optical response with<br>
a standard or expected response can be used to determine whether and to what<br>
degree the sample comprising a mutant hydrolase or a fusion thereof possesses a<br>
given characteristic.<br>
In another embodiment, the functional group is a ligand for an acceptor<br>
molecule. Typically, where the substrate comprises a functional group that is a<br>
member of a specific binding pair (a ligand), the complementary member (the<br>
acceptor) is immobilized on a solid or semi-solid surface, such as a polymer,<br>
polymeric membrane or polymeric particle (such as a polymeric bead).<br>
Representative specific binding pairs include biotin and avidin (or streptavidin or<br>
anti-biotin), IgG and protein A or protein G, drug and drug receptor, toxin and<br>
toxin receptor, carbohydrate and lectin or carbohydrate receptor, peptide and<br>
peptide receptor, protein and protein receptor, enzyme substrate and enzyme,<br>
sense DNA or RNA and antisense (complementary) DNA or RNA, hormone and<br>
hormone receptor, and ion and chelator. Ligands for which naturally occurring<br>
receptors exist include natural and synthetic proteins, including avidin and<br>
streptavidin, antibodies, enzymes, and hormones; nucleotides and natural ori<br>
synthetic oligonucleotides, including primers for RNA and single- and doublestranded<br>
DNA; lipids; polysaccharides and carbohydrates; and a variety of drugs,<br>
including therapeutic drugs and drugs of abuse and pesticides. Where the<br>
functional group is a chelator of calcium, sodium, magnesium, potassium, or<br>
another biologically important metal ion, the substrate comprising such a<br>
functional group functions as an indicator of the ion. Alternatively, such a<br>
substrate may act as a pH indicator. Preferably, the detectable optical response of<br>
the ion indicator is a change in fluorescence.<br>
The sample comprising a mutant hydrolase or a fusion thereof is typically<br>
labeled by passive means, i.e., by incubation with the substrate. However, any<br>
method of introducing the substrate into the sample comprising a mutant<br>
hydrolase or a fusion thereof, such as microinjection of a substrate into a cell or<br>
organelle, can be used to introduce the substrate into the sample comprising a<br>
mutant hydrolase or a fusion thereof. The substrates of the present invention are<br>
generally non-toxic to living cells and other biological components, within the<br>
concentrations of use.<br>
The sample comprising a mutant hydrolase or a fusion thereof can be<br>
observed immediately after contact with a substrate of the invention. The sample<br>
comprising a mutant hydrolase or a fusion thereof is optionally combined with<br>
other solutions in the course of labeling, including wash solutions,<br>
permeabilization and/or fixation solutions, and other solutions containing<br>
additional detection reagents. Washing following contact with the substrate<br>
generally improves the detection of the optical response due to the decrease in<br>
non-specific background after washing. Satisfactory visualization is possible<br>
without washing by using lower labeling concentrations. A number of fixatives<br>
and fixation conditions are known in the art, including formaldehyde,<br>
paraformaldehyde, formalin, glutaraldehyde, cold methanol and 3:1<br>
methanol: acetic acid. Fixation is typically used to preserve cellular morphology<br>
and to reduce biohazards when working with pathogenic samples. Selected<br>
embodiments of the substrates are well retained in cells. Fixation is optionally<br>
followed or accompanied by permeabilization, such as with acetone, ethanol,<br>
DMSO or various detergents, to allow bulky substrates of the invention, to cross<br>
cell membranes, according to methods generally known in the art. Optionally,<br>
the use of a substrate may be combined with the use of an additional detection<br>
reagent that produces a detectable response due to the presence of a specific cell<br>
component, intracellular substance, or cellular condition, in a sample comprising<br>
a mutant hydrolase or a fusion thereof. Where the additional detection reagent<br>
has spectral properties that differ from those of the substrate, multi-color<br>
applications are possible.<br>
At any time after or during contact with the substrate comprising a<br>
functional group with optical properties, the sample comprising a mutant<br>
hydrolase or a fusion thereof is illuminated with a wavelength of light that<br>
results in a detectable optical response, and observed with a means for detecting<br>
the optical response. While some substrates are detectable colorimetrically, using<br>
ambient light, other substrates are detected by the fluorescence properties of the<br>
parent fluorophore. Upon illumination, such as by an ultraviolet or visible<br>
wavelength emission lamp, an arc lamp, a laser, or even sunlight or ordinary<br>
room light, the substrates, including substrates bound to the complementary<br>
specific binding pair member, display intense visible absorption as well as<br>
fluorescence emission. Selected equipment that is useful for illuminating the<br>
substrates of the invention includes, but is not limited to, hand-held ultraviolet<br>
lamps, mercury arc lamps, xenon lamps, argon lasers, laser diodes, and YAG<br>
lasers. These illumination sources are optionally integrated into laser scanners,<br>
fluorescence microplate readers, standard or mini fluorometers, or<br>
chromatographic detectors. This colorimetric absorbance or fluorescence<br>
emission is optionally detected by visual inspection, or by use of any of the<br>
following devices: CCD cameras, video cameras, photographic film, laser<br>
scanning devices, fluorometers, photodiodes, quantum counters, epifluorescence<br>
microscopes, scanning microscopes, flow cytometers, fluorescence microplate<br>
readers, or by means for amplifying the signal such as photomultiplier tubes.<br>
Where the sample comprising a mutant hydrolase or a fusion thereof is examined<br>
using a flow cytometer, a fluorescence microscope or a fluorometer, the<br>
instrument is optionally used to distinguish and discriminate between the<br>
substrate comprising a functional group which is a fluorophore and a second<br>
fluorophore with detectably different optical properties, typically by<br>
distinguishing the fluorescence response of the substrate from that of the second<br>
fluorophore. Where the sample comprising a mutant hydrolase or a fusion<br>
thereof is examined using a flow cytometer, examination of the sample<br>
comprising a mutant hydrolase or a fusion thereof optionally includes isolation<br>
of particles within the sample comprising a mutant hydrolase or a fusion thereof<br>
based on the fluorescence response of the substrate by using a sorting device.<br>
In one embodiment, intracellular movements may be monitored using a<br>
fusion of the mutant hydrolase of the invention. For example, beta-arrestin is a<br>
regulator of G-protein coupled receptors, that moves from the cytoplasm to the<br>
cell membrane when it is activated. A cell containing a fusion of a mutant<br>
hydrolase and beta-arrestin and a substrate of the invention allows the detection<br>
of the movement of beta-arrestin from the cytoplasm to the cell membrane as it<br>
associates with activated G-protein coupled receptors.<br>
In another embodiment, FRET may be employed with a fusion of the<br>
mutant<br>
hydrolase and a fluorescent protein, e.g., GFP, or a fusion with a protein that<br>
binds fluorescent molecules, e.g., O-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT)<br>
(Keppler et al., 2003). Alternatively, a fusion of a mutant hydrolase and a<br>
protein of interest and a second fusion of a fluorescent protein and a molecule<br>
suspected of interacting with the protein of interest may be employed to study<br>
the interaction of the protein of interest with the molecule, e.g., using FRET.<br>
One cell may contain the fusion of a mutant hydrolase and a protein of interest<br>
while another cell may contain the second fusion of a fluorescent protein and a<br>
molecule suspected of interacting with the protein of interest. A population with<br>
those two cells may be contacted with a substrate and an agent, e.g., a drug, after<br>
which the cells are monitored to detect the effect of agent administration on the<br>
two populations.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the mutant hydrolase is fused to a fluorescent<br>
protein. The fusion protein can thus be detected in cells by detecting the<br>
fluorescent protein or by contacting the cells with a substrate of the invention<br>
and detecting the functional group in the substrate. The detection of the<br>
fluorescent protein may be conducted before the detection of the functional<br>
group. Alternatively, the detection of the functional group may be conducted<br>
before the detection of the fluorescent protein. Moreover, those cells can be<br>
contacted with additional substrates, e.g., those having a different functional<br>
group, and the different functional group in the cell detected, which functional<br>
group is covalentiy linked to mutant hydrolase not previously bound by the first<br>
substrate.<br>
In yet another embodiment, a fusion of a mutant hydrolase and a<br>
transcription factor may be employed to monitor activation of transcription<br>
activation pathways. For example, a fusion of a mutant hydrolase to a<br>
transcription factor present in the cytoplasm in an inactive form but which is<br>
translocated to the nucleus upon activation (e.g., NF kappa Beta) can monitor<br>
transcription activation pathways.<br>
In another embodiment, biotin is employed as a functional group in a<br>
substrate and the fusion includes a mutant hydrolase fused to a protein of interest<br>
suspected of interacting with another molecule, e.g., a protein, in a cell. The use<br>
of such reagents permits the capture of the other molecule which interacts in the<br>
cell with the protein fused to the mutant hydrolase, thereby identifying and/or<br>
capturing (isolating) the interacting molecule(s).<br>
In one embodiment, the mutant hydrolase is fused to a protein that is<br>
secreted. Using that fusion and a substrate of the invention, the secreted protein<br>
may be detected and/or monitored. Similarly, when the mutant hydrolase is<br>
fused to a membrane protein that is transported between different vesicular<br>
compartments, in the presence of the substrate, protein processing within these<br>
compartments can be detected. In yet another embodiment, when the mutant<br>
hydrolase is fused to an ion channel or transport protein, or a protein that is<br>
closely associated with the channel or transport protein, the movement of ions<br>
across cell or organelle membranes can be monitored in the presence of a<br>
substrate of the invention which contains an ion sensitive fluorophore. Likewise,<br>
when the mutant hydrolase is fused to proteins associated with vesicals or<br>
cytoskeleton, in the presense of the substrate, transport of proteins or vesicals<br>
along cytoskeletal structures can be readily detected.<br>
In another embodiment, the functional group is a drug or toxin. By<br>
combining a substrate with such a functional group with a fusion of a mutant<br>
hydrolase and a targeting molecule such as an antibody, e.g., one which binds to<br>
an antigen associated with specific tumor cells, a drug or toxin can be targeted<br>
within a cell or within an animal. Alternatively, the functional group may be a<br>
fluorophore which, when present in a substrate and combined with a fusion of a<br>
mutant hydrolase and a targeting molecule such as a single chain antibody, the<br>
targeting molecule is labeled, e.g., a labeled antibody for in vitro applications<br>
such as an ELISA.<br>
In yet another embodiment, when fused to a protein expressed on the cell<br>
surface, a mutant hydrolase on the cell surface, when combined with a substrate<br>
of the invention, e.g., one which contains a fluorophore, maybe employed to<br>
monitor cell migration (e.g., cancer cell migration) in vivo or in vitro. In one<br>
embodiment, the substrate of the invention is one that has low or no permeability<br>
to the cell membrane. Alternatively, such a system can be used to monitor the<br>
effect of different agents, e.g., drugs, on different pools of cells. In yet another<br>
embodiment, the mutant hydrolase is fused to a HERG channel. Cells<br>
expressing such a fusion, in the presence of a substrate of the invention which<br>
includes a K+-sensitive fluorophore, may be employed to monitor the activity of<br>
the HERG channel, e.g., to monitor drug-toxicity.<br>
hi another embodiment, the substrate of the invention includes a<br>
functional group useful to monitor for hydrophobic regions, e.g., Nile Red, in a<br>
cell or organism.<br>
Thus, the mutant hydrolases and substrates of the invention are useful in<br>
a wide variety of assays, e.g., phage display, panning, ELISA, Western blot,<br>

prepackaged columns were from Amersham Biosciences.<br>
Luria-Broth ("LB") was provided by Promega Corporation.<br>
Methods<br>
PCR reactions. DNA amplification was performed using standard<br>
polymerase chain reaction buffers supplied by Promega Corp. Typically, 50 ul<br>
reactions included Ix concentration of the manufacturer's supplied buffer, 1.5<br>
mM MgCl2,125 yM dATP, 125 uM dCTP, 125 uM dGTP, 125 uM dTTP, 0.10-<br>
1.0 uM forward and reverse primers, 5 U AmpliTaq® DNA Polymerase and 
ng target DNA. Unless otherwise indicated, the thermal profile for amplification<br>
of DNA was 35 cycles of 0.5 minutes at 94°C; 1 minute at 55°C; and 1 minute at<br>
72°C.<br>
DNA sequencing. All clones were confirmed by DNA sequencing using<br>
the dideoxy-terminal cycle-sequencing method (Sanger et al., 1977) and a<br>
Perkin-Elmer Model 310 DNA sequencer. (Foster City, CA).<br>
SDS-PAGE. Proteins were solubilized in a sample buffer (1% SDS, 10%<br>
glycerol, and 1.0 mM p-mercaptoethanol, pH 6.8; Promega Corporation), boiled<br>
for 5 minutes and resolved on SDS-PAGE (4-20% gradient gels; BioWhittaker<br>
Molecular Applications). Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue (Promega<br>
Corp.) for Western blot analysis or were analyzed on a fluoroimager (Hitachi,<br>
Japan) at an Em/Em appropriate for each fluorophore evaluated.<br>
Western blot analysis. Electrophoretic transfer of proteins to a<br>
nitrocellulose membrane (0.2 um, Scheicher &amp; Schuell, Germany) was carried<br>
out in 25 mM Tris base/188 mM glycine (pH 8.3), 20% (v/v) methanol for 2.0<br>
hours with a constant current of 80 mA (at 4°C) in Xcell II Blot module<br>
(Invitrogen). The membranes were rinsed with TBST buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl,<br>
150 mM NaCl, pH 7.6, containing 0.05% Tween 20) and incubated in blocking<br>
solution (3% dry milk or 1% BSA in TBST buffer) for 30 minutes at room<br>
temperature or overnight at 4°C. Then membranes were washed with 50 ml of<br>
TBST buffer and incubated with anti-FLAGR monoclonal antibody M2 (dilution<br>
1:5,000), wA\-Renilla luciferase monoclonal antibody (dilution 1:5,000), or<br>
HRP-conjugated streptavidin (dilution 1:10,000) for 45 minutes at room<br>
temperature. Then the membranes were washed with TBST buffer (50 ml, 5<br>
minutes, 3 times). The membranes that had been probed with antibody were<br>
then incubated with HRP-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (30 minutes, room<br>
temperature) and then the washing procedure was repeated. The proteins were<br>
visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Pharmacia-<br>
Amersham) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Levels of proteins<br>
were quantified using computer-assisted densitometry.<br>
Protein concentration. Protein was measured by the microtiter protocol<br>
of the Pierce BCA Protein assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL) using bovine serum<br>
albumin (BSA) as a standard.<br>
Statistic analysis. Data were expressed as mean +/- S.E.M. values from<br>
experiments performed in quadruplicate, representative of at least 3 independent<br>
experiments with similar results. Statistical significance was assessed by the<br>
student's t test and considered significant when/? 
Bacterial cells. The initial stock of Dh5a cells containing pET-3a with<br>
Rhodococcus rodochorus (DhaA) was kindly provided by Dr. Clifford J.<br>
Unkefer (Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM) (Schindler et al.,<br>
1999; Newman et al., 1999). Bacteria were cultured in LB using a premixed<br>
reagent provided by Promega Corp. Freezer stocks of E. coli BL21 (XDE3)<br>
pET3a (stored in 10% glycerol, -80°C) were used to inoculate Luria-Bertani agar<br>
plates supplemented with ampicillin (50 fig/ml) (Sambrook et al., 1989). Single<br>
colonies were selected and used to inoculate two 10 ml cultures of Luria-Bertani<br>
medium containing 50 ng/ml ampicillin. The cells were cultured for 8 hours at<br>
37°C with shaking (220 rpm), after which time 2 ml was used to inoculate each<br>
of two 50 ml of Luria-Bertani medium containing 50 |J.g/ml ampicillin, which<br>
were grown overnight at 37°C with shaking. Ten milliliters of this culture was<br>
used to inoculate each of two 0.5 L Luria-Bertani medium with ampicillin.<br>
When the A^o of the culture reached 0.6, isopropyl-1-thio-p-Dgalactopyranoside<br>
(IPTG) was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mM, and<br>
cultures were maintained for an additional 4 hours at 30°C with shaking. The<br>
cells were then harvested by centrifugation and washed with 10 mM Tris-SO4,1<br>
mM EDTA, pH 7.5. The cell pellets were stored at -70°C prior to cell lysis.<br>
Mammalian cells. CHO-K1 cells (ATCC-CCL61) were cultured in a 1:1<br>
mixture of Ham's F12 nutrients and Dulbecco's modified minimal essential<br>
medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin,<br>
and 100 mg/ml streptomycin, in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% COj at 37°C.<br>
Rat hippocampal (El 8) primary neurons were isolated as described<br>
below. Briefly, fragments of embryonic (El 8) rat hippocampus in Hibernate™<br>
E media (GIBCO, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), obtained from Dr. Brewer<br>
(Southern Illinois University), were dissociated and plated on poly-D-lysin<br>
coated (0.28 mg/cm2; Sigma) glass/plastic-ware and cultured in serum-free<br>
Neurobasal™ media with B27 supplement (NB27, GIBCO). All media were<br>
changed every 2-3 days.<br>
Transfecu'on. To study transient expression of different proteins, cells<br>
were plated in 35 mm culture dishes or 24 well plates. At about 80-90%<br>
confluency, the cells were exposed to a mixture of lipofectamine/DNA/antibiotic<br>
free media according to the manufacturer's (GIBCO) instructions. The<br>
following day, media was replaced with fresh media and cells were allowed to<br>
grow for various periods of time.<br>
Fluorescence. Fluorescence in cells in 96 well plates was measured on<br>
fluorescent plate reader CytoFluorll (Beckman) at an Eex/Eem appropriate for<br>
particular fluorophores (e.g., Em/Em for TAMRA is 540/575 nm).<br>
Example II<br>
A DJiaA-Basect Tethering System<br>
A. Wild-Type and Mutant DhaA Proteins and Fusions Thereof<br>
A halo-alkane dehydrogenase from Rhodococcus rhodochrous is a<br>
product of the DhaA gene (MW about 33 kDa). This enzyme cleaves carbonhalogen<br>
bonds in aliphatic and aromatic halogenated compounds, e.g., HaloCs-<br>
HaloCio. The catalytic center of DhaA is a typical "catalytic triad", comprising a<br>
nucleophile, an acid and a histidine residue. It is likely that substrate binds to<br>
DhaA to form an E'S complex, after which nucleophilic attack by Asp 106 forms<br>
an ester intermediate, His272 then activates HzO that hydrolyzes the<br>
intermediate, releasing product from the catalytic center. To determine whether<br>
a point mutation of the catalytic His272 residue impairs enzymatic activity of the<br>
enzyme so as to enable covalent tethering of a functional group (FG) to this<br>
protein, mutant DhaAs were prepared.<br>
Materials and Methods<br>
To prepare mutant DhaA vectors, Promega's in vitro mutagenesis kit<br>
which is based on four primer overlap-extension method was employed (Ho et t<br>
al., 1989) to produce DhaA.H272 to F, A, G, or H mutations. The external<br>
primers were oligonucleotides 5'-<br>
GCTTCACTTGTCGTCATCGTCCTTGTAGTCA-3' (SEQ ID NO:1) and 5'-<br>
GCTTCACTTGTCGTCATCGTCCTTGTAGTCA-3' (SEQ ID NO:2), and the<br>
internal mutagenic primers were as follows: H272F (5;-<br>
CCGGGATTGHCTACCTCCAGGAAGA03'), SEQ ID NO:3), H272A (5'-<br>
CCGGGATTGG££TACCTCCAGGAAGAC-3'; SEQ ID NO:4), H272G (5'-<br>
CCGGGATTGCAG.TACCTCCAGGAAGAC-3'; SEQ ID NO:5), and H272Q<br>
(5'-CCGGGATTGGIiCTACCTCCAGGAAGAC-3'; SEQ ID NO:6) (the<br>
mutated codons are underlined). The mutated dehalogenase genes were<br>
subcloned into the pET-3a vector. For overexpression of mutant dehalogenases,<br>
the pET-3a vector was transformed into competent E. coli BL21 (DE3). The<br>
DhaA sequence in clones was confirmed by DNA sequencing.<br>
GST-DhaA (WT or H272F/A/G/H mutants) fusion cassettes were<br>
constructed by cloning the appropriate DhaA coding regions into SaWNotl sites<br>
of pGEXSxS vector. Two primers (5'-<br>
ACGCGTCGACGCCGCCATGTCAGAAATCGGTACAGGC-3' and 5'-<br>
ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCTCAAGCGCTTCAACCGGTGAGTGCGGGGAGC<br>
CAGCGCGC-3'; SEQ ID N0s:7 and 8, respectively) were designed to add a<br>
Sail site and a Kozak consensus sequence to the 5' coding regions of DhaA, to<br>
add aNotl, EcoR47Ul, sndAgel restriction site and stop codons to the 3' coding<br>
region of DhaA, and to amplify a 897 bp fragment from a DhaA (WT or mutant)<br>
template. The resulting fragments were inserted into the SaWNotl site of pGEX-<br>
\.<br>
5X-3, a vector containing a glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene, a sequence<br>
encoding a Factor Xa cleavage site, and multiple cloning sites (MCS) followed<br>
by a stop codon.<br>
A Flag coding sequence was then inserted into the Agel/EcoR47lU<br>
restriction sites of the pGEX5X-3 vector. In frame with the six nucleotide Agel<br>
site is a sequence for an 11 amino acid peptide, the final octapeptide of which<br>
corresponds to the Flag peptide (Kodak Imaging Systems, Rochester, NY). Two<br>
complementary oligonucleotides (5'-<br>
CCGGTGACTACAAGGACGATGACGACAAGTGAAGC-3', sense, SEQ ID<br>
NO:9, and 5'-GCTTCACTTGTCGTCATCGTCCTTGTAGTCA-3', antisense,<br>
SEQ ID NO: 10) coding the Flag peptide (Kodak Imaging Systems, Rochester,<br>
NY) were annealed. The annealed DNA had an Agel site at the 5' end and an<br>
EcoR47Hl at the 3' end. The annealed DNA was digested with^gel and<br>
EcoR47lll and then subcloned into the GST-DhaA.WT or GST-DhaA.H272F<br>
mutant constructs at the Agel and EcoR471E sites. All gene fusion constructs<br>
were confirmed by DNA sequencing.<br>
To generate GST-DhaA fusion proteins, enzyme expression was induced<br>
by the addition of isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside (at a final concentration<br>
of 0.5 mM) when the culture reached an optical density of 0.6 at 600 nm. The<br>
cells were harvested in Buffer A (10 mM Tris-SCU, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM pmercaptoethanol,<br>
and 10 % glycerol, pH 7.5), and disrupted by sonication using<br>
a Vibra Cell™ sonicator (Sonics &amp; Materials, Danbury, CT, USA). Cell debris<br>
was removed by centrifugation at 19,800 x g for 1 hour. The crude extract was<br>
further purified on a GSS-Sepharose 4 fast flow column (Amersham<br>
Biosciences; Piscataway, NJ) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The<br>
elution fractions containing GST-DhaA fusion protein were pooled, dialyzed<br>
against a 10 mM Tris-SCU buffer (containing 20 mM Na2SO4 and 1 mM EDTANa2)<br>
overnight at 4°C, and stored at<br>
-20°C until use. To generate DhaA (WT or mutant), GST was cleaved from the<br>
fusion proteins with Factor Xa, and the products purified on GSS-Sepharose 4<br>
(Amersham Biosciences; Piscataway, NJ) according to the manufacturer's<br>
instructions. Homogeneity of the proteins was verified by SDS-PAGE. In some<br>
experiments, the cell free extract was fractionated using 45-70% saturated<br>
ammonium sulfate as described by Newman et al. (1999).<br>
Results<br>
Figure 3 shows robust, IPTG inducible production of GST-DhaA.WTFlag<br>
(lane 1) and GST-DhaA.H272F-Flag (lane 2) fusion proteins. Moreover,<br>
the proteins were soluble and could be efficiently purified on GSS-Sepharose<br>
4FF (lanes 5-10, odd numbered lanes correspond to GST-DhaA.WT-Flag and<br>
even numbered lanes correspond to GST-DhaA.H272F-Flag). Treatment of the<br>
fusion proteins with Factor Xa led to the formation of two proteins GST and<br>
DhaA (WT or mutant, lanes 11 and 12, respectively), and GST was efficiently<br>
removed on GSS-Sepharose 4FF (WT or mutant, lanes 13 and 14, respectively).<br>
In addition, all proteins had the predicted molecular weight.<br>
B. Mutation of ff272 H?piif? Ability of DhaA to Hvdrolyze Cl-Alkanes.<br>
Inability of an enzyme to release product of the enzymatic reaction into<br>
surrounding media is essential for the tethering system. This inability can be<br>
detected by significant reduction of the hydrolytic activity of the enzyme.<br>
To study the effect of a point mutation on the activity of DhaA (WT or<br>
mutant) hydrolysis of Cl-alkanes, apH-indicator dye system as described by<br>
Holloway et al. (1998) was employed.<br>
Materials and Methods<br>
The reaction buffer for a pH-indicator dye system consisted of 1 mM<br>
HEPES-SO4 (pH 8.2), 20 mM Na2SO4, and 1 mM EDTA. Phenol red was added<br>
to a final concentration 25 ng/ml. The halogenated compounds were added to<br>
apparent concentrations that could insure that the dissolved fraction of the<br>
substrate was sufficient for the maximum velocity of the dehalogenation<br>
reaction. The substrate-buffer solution was vigorously mixed for 30 seconds by<br>
vortexing, capped to prevent significant evaporation of the substrate and used<br>
within 1-2 hours. Prior to each kinetic determination, the phenol red was titrated<br>
with a standardized solution of HC1 to provide an apparent extinction coefficient.<br>
The steady-state kinetic constants for DhaA were determined at 558 nm at room<br>
temperature on a Beckman Du640 spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter,<br>
Fullerton, CA). Kinetic constants were calculated from initial rates using the<br>
computer program SigmaPlot. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the<br>
amount required to dehaiogenate 1.0 mM of substrate/minute under the specific<br>
conditions.<br>
Results<br>
As shown in Figure 4, using 0.1 mg/ml of enzyme and 10 mM substrate<br>
at pH 7.0-8.2, no catalytic activity was found with any of four mutants. Under<br>
these conditions, the wild-type enzyme had an activity with 1-Cl-butane of 5<br>
units/mg of protein. Thus, the activity of the mutants was reduced by at least<br>
700-fold.<br>
Aliquots of the supernatant obtained from E. coli expressing DhaA (WT<br>
or one of the mutants) were treated with increasing concentrations of (NH4)2SO4.<br>
The proteins were exposed to each (NH^SC^ concentration for 2 hours (4°C),<br>
pelleted by centrinigation, dialyzed overnight against buffer A, and resolved on<br>
SDS-PAGE.<br>
As shown in Figure 5, a major fraction of DhaA. WT and the<br>
DhaA.H272F mutant was precipitated by 45-70% of (NH4)2SO4. No<br>
precipitation of these proteins was observed at low (NH4)2SO4 concentrations,<br>
to contrast, the DhaA.H272Q, DhaA.H272G and DhaA.H272A mutants could be<br>
precipitated by 10% (NH^SOj. This is a strong indication of the significant<br>
change of the physico-chemical characteristics of the DhaA.H272Q,<br>
DhaA.H272G and DhaA.H272A mutants. At the same time, the DhaA.H272F<br>
mutation had no significant effect on these parameters. These data are in good<br>
agreement with results of computer modeling of the effect of mutations on the 3-<br>
D structure of DhaA, indicating that among all tested mutants, only the<br>
DhaA.H272F mutation had no significant effect on the predicted 3-dimensional<br>
model (see Figure 2). Based on these results, DhaA.H272F was chosen for<br>
further experiments.<br>
To form a covalent adduct, the chlorine atom of Cl-alkane is likely<br>
positioned in close proximity to the catalytic amino acids of DhaA (WT or<br>
mutant) (Figure 2). The crystal structure of DhaA (Newman et al., 1999)<br>
indicates that these amino acids are located deep inside of the catalytic pocket of<br>
DhaA (approximately 10 A long and about 20 A2 in cross section). To permit<br>
entry of the reactive group in a substrate for DhaA which includes a functional<br>
group into the catalytic pocket of DhaA, a linker was designed to connect the Clcontaining<br>
substrate with a functional group so that the functional group is<br>
located outside of the catalytic pocket, i.e., so as not to disturb/destroy the 3-D<br>
structure of DhaA.<br>
To determine if DhaA is capable of hydrolyzing Cl-alkanes with a long<br>
hydrophobic carbon chain, DhaA.WT was contacted with various Cl-alkane<br>
alcohols. As shown in Figure 6, DhaA.WT can hydrolyze 1-Cl-alkane alcohols<br>
with 4-10 carbon atoms. Moreover, Ihe initial rate of hydrolysis (IRH) of Clalkanes<br>
had an inverse relationship to the length of a carbon chain, although poor<br>
solubility of long-chain Cl-alkanes in aqueous buffers may affect the efficiency<br>
of the enzyme-substrate interaction. Indeed, as shown in Figure 6, the IRH of 1-<br>
Cl-alkane-10-decanol is much higher than the IRH of 1-Cl-decane. More<br>
importantly, these data indicate that DhaA can hydrolyze Cl-alkanes containing<br>
relatively polar groups (e.g., HO-group).<br>
FAM-modified Cl-alkanes with linkers of different length and/or<br>
hydrophobicity were prepared (Figure 7). DhaA.WT efficiently hydrolyzed Clalkanes<br>
with a relatively bulky functional group (FAM) if the linker was 12 or<br>
more atoms long. No activity of DhaA.H272F/A/G/Q mutants was detected<br>
with any of the tested Cl-alkanes (data not shown). In addition, modification of<br>
the (CHz)6 region adjacent to the Cl-atom led to a significant reduction of the<br>
IRH of the 14-atom linker by DhaA.WT. Nevertheless, if the length and<br>
structure of the linker is compatible with the catalytic site of a hydrolase, the<br>
presence of a linker in a substrate of the invention has substantially no effect on<br>
the reaction.<br>
Some of the samples were analyzed on an automated HPLC (Hewlett-<br>
Packard Model 1050) system. A DAD detector was set to record UV-visible<br>
spectra over the 200-600 ran range. Fluorescence was detected at an Em/Eem<br>
equal 480/520 ran and 540/575 nm for FAM- and TAMRA-modified substrates,<br>
respectively. Ethanol extracts of Cl-alkanes or products of Cl-alkane hydrolysis<br>
were analyzed using analytical reverse phase Cu column (Adsorbosphere HS,<br>
5\i, 150 x 4.6 mm; Hewlett-Packard, Clifton, NJ) with a linear gradient of 10<br>
mM ammonium acetate (pH 7.0):ACN (acetom'trile) from 25:75 to 1:99 (v/v)<br>
applied over 30 minutes at 1.0 ml/minute. Quantisation of the separated<br>
compounds was based on the integrated surface of the collected peaks.<br>
Figure 8A shows the complete separation of the substrate and the product<br>
of the reaction. Figure 8B indicates that wild-type DhaA very efficiently<br>
hydrolyzed FAM-CnH^CVCl. Similar results were obtained when TAMRACi4H24O4-<br>
Cl or ROX.5-Ci4H24O4-Cl were used as substrates (data not shown).<br>
Taken together these data confirm the results of the pH-indicator dye-based<br>
assay showing complete inactivation of DhaA by the DhaA.H272F mutation.<br>
i<br>
C. Covalent Tethering of Functional Groups to DhaA Mutants In Vitro<br>
Materials and Methods<br>
MALDI analysis of proteins was performed at the University of<br>
Wisconsin Biotechnology Center using a matrix assisted laser<br>
desorption/ionization time-of-life (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer Bruker<br>
Biflex III (Bruker, USA.). To prepare samples, 100 ug of purified DhaA (WT or<br>
H272F mutant) or GST-DhaA (WT or H272F mutant) fusion protein (purified to<br>
about 90% homogeneity) in 200 nl of buffer (1 mM HEPES-SO4 (pH 7.4), 20<br>
mM NaaSO4, and 1 mM EDTA) were incubated with or without substrate<br>
(FAM-Ci4H24O4-Cl, at 1.0 mM, final concentration) for 15 minutes at room<br>
temperature. Then the reaction mixtures were dialyzed against 20 mM<br>
CHaCOONHU (pH 7.0) overnight at 4°C and M/Z values of the proteins and<br>
protein-substrate complexes determined.<br>

the Blpl site at the 3' end. The annealed oligonucleotides were digested with Styl<br>
and Blpl and subcloned into GST-DhaA.WT or GST-DhaA.H272F at Styl and<br>
Blpl sites. All mutants were confirmed by DNA sequencing.<br>
Results<br>
To confirm that DhaA.H272 mutants were capable of binding Cl-alkanes<br>
with functional groups, these mutants or their GST-fusions, as well as the<br>
corresponding wild-type proteins or fusions, were contacted with FAMCi4H24O4-<br>
Cl, TAMRA-Ci4H24O4-Cl, ROX.5-Ci4H24O4-Cl, orbiotin-CuH32O4-<br>
Cl for 15 minutes at room temperature. Then the proteins were resolved on<br>
SDS-PAGE. The gels containing proteins were incubated with FAM-Ci4H24O4-<br>
Cl, TAMRA-Ci4H24O4-Cl, or ROX.5-Ci4H24O4-Cl and were analyzed by<br>
fluoroimager (Hitachi, Japan) at an Eex/Eem appropriate for each fluorophore.<br>
Gels containing proteins incubated with biotin-CigH32O4-Cl were transferred to a<br>
nitrocellulose membrane and probed with HRP conjugated streptavidin.<br>
As shown in Figure 9, TAMRA-Ci4H24O4-Cl (lanes 1 and 2 in panel A),<br>
FAM-Ci^-^-Cl (lanes 3 and 4 in panel A), and ROX.5-C14H24O4-C1 (lanes 5<br>
and 6 in panel A) bound to DhaA.H272F (lanes 2,4 and 6 in panel A) but not to<br>
DhaA.WT (lanes 1,3 and 5 in panel A). Biotin-CigH34O4-Cl bound to<br>
DhaA.H272F (lanes 9-14 in panel B) but not to DhaA.WT (lanes 1-8 in panel<br>
B). Moreover, the binding of biotJn-CigH34O4-Cl to DhaA.H272F (lanes 9-14 in<br>
panel B) was dose dependent and could be detected at 0.2 pM. Further, the bond<br>
between substrates and DhaA.H272F was very strong, since boiling with SDS<br>
did not break the bond.<br>
All tested DhaA.H272 mutants, i.e. H272F/G/A/Q, bound to TAMRACi4-<br>
Cl (Figure 10). Further, the DhaA.H272 mutants bind the substrates in a<br>
highly specific manner, since pretreatment of the mutants with one of the<br>
substrates (biotin-Qgl^CVCl) completely blocked the binding of another<br>
substrate (TAMRA-Ci^^-Cl) (Figure 10).<br>
To determine the nature of the bond between Cl-alkanes and the<br>
DhaA.H272F mutant (or the GST-DhaA.H272F mutant fusion protein), these<br>
proteins were incubated with and without FAM-Ci^-A-Cl, and analyzed by<br>
MALDI. As shown in Figure 11, the bond between mutant DhaA.H272F and<br>
FAM-Ci4H24C&gt;4-Cl is strong. Moreover, the analysis of the E*S complex<br>
indicated the covalent nature of the bond between the substrate (e.g., FAMCi4H24O4-<br>
Cl) and DhaA.H272F. The MALDI-TOF analysis also confirms that<br>
the substrate/protein adduct is formed in a 1:1 relationship.<br>
DhaA mutants at another residue in the catalytic triad, residue 106, were<br>
prepared. The residue at position 106 in wild-type DhaA is D, one of the known<br>
nucleophilic amino acid residues. D at residue 106 in DhaA was substituted<br>
with nucleophilic ammo acid residues other than D, e.g., C, Y and E, which may<br>
form a bond with a substrate which is more stable than the bond formed between<br>
wild-type DhaA and the substrate. In particular, cysteine is a known nucleopnile<br>
in cysteine-based enzymes, and those enzymes are not known to activate water.<br>
A control mutant, DhaA.D106Q, single mutants DhaA.D106C,<br>
DhaA.D106Y, and DhaA.D106E, as well as double mutants<br>
DhaA.D106C:H272F, DhaA.D106E:H272F, DhaA.D106Q:H272F, and<br>
DhaA.D106Y:H272F were analyzed for binding to TAMRA-Cnl^CVCl<br>
(Figure 12). As shown in Figure 12, TAMRA-CM^CVCl bound to<br>
DhaA.D106C, DhaA.D106C:H272F, DhaA.D106E, and DhaA.H272F. Thus,<br>
the bond formed between TAMRA-CH^CVCl and cysteine or glutamate at<br>
residue 106 in a mutant DhaA is stable relative to the bond formed between<br>
TAMRA-Ci4H24O4-Cl and wild-type DhaA. Other substitutions at position 106<br>
alone or in combination with substitutions at other residues in DhaA may yield<br>
similar results. Further, certain substitutions at position 106 alone or in<br>
combination with substitutions at other residues in DhaA may result in a mutant<br>
DhaA that forms a bond with only certain substrates.<br>

Materials and Methods<br>
phRLuc-linker-DhaA.WT-Flag and phRLuc-linker-DhaA.H272F-Flag<br>
fusion cassettes were constructed by cloning the phRLuc coding region into the<br>
NheVSall sites of the pCIneo vector which contains a myristic acid attachment<br>
peptide coding sequence (MAS). Two primers (5'-<br>
GCTTCACTTGTCGTCATCGTCCTTOTAGTCA-3'; SEQ ID NO:11) and (5'-<br>
GCTTCACTTGTCGTCATCGTCCTTGTAGTCA-3'; SEQ ID NO: 12) were<br>
designed to add Nhel and Sail sites to the 5' and 3' coding regions, respectively,<br>
of phRLuc and to amplify a 900 bp fragment from a phRLuc template (pGL3<br>
vector, Promega). Then, a myristic acid attachment peptide coding sequence<br>
was excised with Nhel and Sail restriction enzymes and the amplified fragment<br>
containing phRLuc was inserted into the NheUSall restriction sites of<br>
pCIneo.DhaA.(WT or H272F)-Flag vector. The sequence of each construct was<br>
confirmed by DNA sequencing. Promega's TNT® T7Quick system was then<br>
used to generate fusion proteins in vitro.<br>
Results<br>
To demonstrate tethering of proteins to a solid support via DhaA.H272FCl-<br>
alkane bridge, vectors encoding a fusion protein ofRenilla luciferase (hRLuc,<br>
N-terminus of the fusion), a protein connector (17 amino acids, see Table I), and<br>
DhaA (WT or H272F mutant) were prepared. The Flag epitope was then fused<br>
to the C-terminus of DhaA.<br>

SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis showed that the proteins<br>
had their predicted molecular weights and were recognized by anti-R.Luc and<br>
anti-Flag* M2 antibodies. In addition, all fusion proteins had Renilla luciferase<br>
activity (as determined by Promega's Renilla Luciferase Assay System in PBS<br>
pH 7.4 buffer).<br>
Tethering of proteins to a solid support via a DhaA.H272F-Cl-alkane<br>
bridge was shown by using biotin-CigHaaCVCl as a substrate and streptavidin<br>
(SA)-coated 96 well plates (Pierce, USA) as solid support. Translated proteins<br>
were contacted with biotin-CigHszCVCl substrate at 25 pM (final concentration),<br>
for 60 minutes at room temperature. Unbound biotin-CiglfoCU-Cl was removed<br>
by gel-filtration on Sephadex O-25 prepackaged columns (Amersham<br>
Biosciences). Collected fractions of R.Luc-connector-DhaA fusions were placed<br>
in SA-coated 96-well plate for 1 hour at room temperature, unbound proteins<br>
were washed out and luciferase activity was measured.<br>
Figure 13A shows Renilla luciferase activity captured on the plate.<br>
Analysis of these data indicated that only the fusion containing the mutant DhaA<br>
was captured. The efficiency of capturing was very high (more than 50% of<br>
Renilla luciferase activity added to the plate was captured). In contrast, the<br>
efficiency of capturing of fusions containing wild-type DhaA as well as Renilla<br>
luciferase was negligibly small (
DhaA.H272F with a non-biotinylated substrate (TAMRA-Ci4H24O4-Cl)<br>
decreased the efficiency of capturing by about 80%. Further, there was no effect<br>
of pretreatment with a nonbiotinylated substrate on the capturing of the R.Lucconnector-<br>
DhaA.WT oiRenilla luciferase.<br>
Taken together, these data demonstrate that active enzymes (e.g., Renilla<br>
luciferase) can be tethered to a solid support that forms part of a substrate of the<br>
invention (Cl-alkane-DhaA.H272F-bridge), and retain enzymatic activity.<br>

Mutant DhaA and Substrate System In Vivo<br>
A. Covalent Tethering of Functional Groups to DhaA Mutants In Vivo: in<br>
Prokaryotes and Eukarvotes<br>
Materials and Methods<br>
To study the binding of a substrate of the invention to a mutant hydrolase<br>
expressed in prokaryotes, E. coli cells BL21 (^DE3) pLys65 were transformed<br>
with pOEX-5X-3.DhaA.WT-Flag or pQEX-5X-3.DhaA.H272F-Flag, grown in<br>
liquid culture, and induced with IPTG. Either TAMRA-Ci4H24O4-Cl or biotin-<br>
CigthzCVCl was added to the induced cells (final concentration, 25 uM). After<br>
1 hour, cells were harvested, washed with cold PBS (pH 7.3), disrupted by<br>
sonication, and fractionated by centrifugation at 19,800 x g for 1 hour. Soluble<br>
fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Gels with proteins isolated from cells<br>
treated with TAMRA-Ci4H24O4-Cl were analyzed on a fluoroimager, while<br>
proteins from cells treated with biotm-CigHszCVCl were transferred to a<br>
nitrocellulose membrane and probed with HRP-conjugated streptavidin.<br>
To study the binding of TAMRA-Cu^CVCl in mammalian cells,<br>
DhaA.WT-Flag and DhaA.H272F-Flag coding regions were excised from<br>
pGEX-5X-3.DhaA.WT-Flag or pGEX-5X-3.DhaA.H272F-Flag, respectively,<br>
gel purified, and inserted into SaWNotl restriction sites of pCIneo.CMV vector<br>
(Promega). The constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.<br>
CHO-K1 cells were plated in 24 well plates (Labsystems) and transfected<br>
with a pCIneo-CMV.DhaA.WT-Flag or pCIneo-CMV.DhaA.H272F-Flag vector.<br>
Twenty-four hours later, media was replaced with fresh media containing 25 uM<br>
TAMRA-C14H24O4-C1 and the cells were placed into a CO2 incubator for 60<br>
minutes. Following this incubation, media was removed, cells were quickly<br>
washed with PBS (pH 7.4; four consecutive washes: 1.0 ml/cm2; 5 seconds each)<br>
and the cells were solubilized in a sample buffer (1% SDS, 10% glycerol, and<br>
the like; 250 ul/well). Proteins (10 nl/lane) were resolved on SDS-PAGE (4-<br>
20% gradient gels) and the binding of the TAMRA-Ci4H24O4-Cl was detected by<br>
a fluoroimager (Hitachi, Japan) at Eex/Eam equal 540/575 nm.<br>
Results<br>
Figures 14A and B show the binding of biotin-CigHtaCVCl (A) and<br>
TAMRA-Ci2H24O4-Cl (B) to E. coli proteins in vivo. The low molecular band<br>
on Figure 14A is an E. coli protein recognizable by HRP-SA, while the<br>
fluorescence detected in the bottom part of Panel B was fluorescence of free<br>
TAMRA-Ci2H24O4-Cl. Figure 15 shows the binding of TAMRA-Ci2H24O4-Cl to<br>
eukaryotic cell proteins in vivo.<br>
Analysis of Figure 14 and Figure 15 showed that the DhaA.H272F-Flag<br>
mutant but not DhaA.WT-Flag binds TAMRA-Cu^CVCl or biotin-QgEfoCV<br>
Cl in vivo. Moreover, the bond between DhaA.H272F-Flag and the substrate<br>
was very strong (probably covalent), since boiling with SDS followed by SDSPAGE<br>
did not disrupt the bond between the mutant enzyme and the substrate.<br>
B. Permeability of Cell Membrane to Substrates of the Invention<br>
Materials and Methods<br>
CHO-K1 Cells (ATCC-CCL61) were cultured in a 1:1 mixture of Ham's<br>
F12 nutrients and Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium supplemented<br>
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml<br>
streptomycin, in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37°C.<br>
To study uptake of different substrates, cells were plated in LT-II<br>
chambers (Nunc) or 96 well plates (Labsystems) at a density of 30,000 cells/cm2.<br>
The following day, media was replaced with media containing different<br>
concentrations of the substrates and cells were placed back in a CO2 incubator<br>
for 2, 5 or 15 minutes. At the end of the incubation, media containing substrate<br>
was removed and cells were quickly washed with PBS (pH 7.4; four consecutive<br>
washes: 1.0 ml/cm2; 5 seconds each). Fresh media was then added to cells, and<br>
the cells were returned to the CO2 incubator at 37°C. The level of fluorescence<br>
in cells in 96 well plates was measured on fluorescent plate reader CytoFluor II<br>
(Beckman) at Em/Em equal 480/520 nm and 540/575 nm for FAM- and<br>
TAMRA-modified substrates, respectively. Fluorescent images of the cells were<br>
taken on inverted epifluorescent microscope Axiovert-100 (Carl Zeiss) with<br>
filter sets appropriate for detection of FITC and TAMRA.<br>
Results<br>
As shown in Figure 16, CHO-K1 cells treated with TAMRA-Ci^KfoCV<br>
Cl (25 uM, 5 minutes at 37°C) could be quickly and efficiently loaded with<br>
TAMRA-Ci^HjgCVCL Image analysis indicated that the fluorescent dye crossed<br>
the cell membrane. Figure 16 also shows that TAMRA-Ci4H28O4-Cl could be<br>
efficiently washed out of the cells. Taken together these data indicate that the<br>
plasma membrane of CHO-K1 cells is permeable to TAMRA-CnHagCU-Cl.<br>
In contrast, FAM-Ci4H24O4-Cl did not cross the plasma membrane of<br>
CHO-K1 cells, even when cells were pretreated with FAM-Ci4H24O4-Cl at high<br>
concentrations (i.e., 100 uM) and for much longer periods of time (60 minutes)<br>
(data not shown). Thus, the different permeabilities of the cell plasma<br>
membrane for various substrates of the invention, e.g., TAMRA-Ci4H24O4-Cl<br>
and FAM-Ci4H24O4-Cl, provides a unique opportunity to label proteins<br>
expressed on the cell surface and proteins expressed inside the cell with different<br>
fluorophores, thereby allowing biplexing.<br>
Example V<br>
DhaA-based Tethering for Cell Imaging In Vivo<br>
A. Colocalization of GFP and TAMRA-C^H^O^-Cl in Living Mammalian Cells<br>
Materials and Methods<br>
A GFP-connector-DhaA fusion cassette was constructed by replacing the<br>
Renilla luciferase coding region in Packard's vector coding GFP-DEVD-Rluc(h)<br>
(Packard #6310066) with DhaA.WT-Flag or DhaA.H272F-Flag coding regions.<br>
Two primers (5'- GGAATGGGCCCTCTAGAQCGACGATGTCA -3'; SEQ ID<br>
NO:15, and 5'- CAOTCAOTCACGATGGATCCGCTC AA -3'; SEQ ID<br>
NO: 16) were designed to add Apal and Bamffl sites (underlined) to the 5' and 3'<br>
coding regions of DhaA, respectively, and to amplify a 980 bp fragment from a<br>
pGEX-5X-3.DhaA.WT-Flag or pGEX-5X-3.DhaA.H272F-Flag template. The<br>
R.Luc coding region was excised with^pal and BamHl restriction enzymes.<br>
Then the 980 bp fragment containing DhaA was inserted into the ApaUBamHl<br>
site of the GFP-DEVD-Rluc(h) coding vector. The sequence of the gene fusion<br>
constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing.<br>
Cells transiently expressing GFP-connector-DhaA.WT-Flag or GFPconnector-<br>
DhaA.H272F-Flag fusion proteins were plated in LT-II chambers<br>
(Nunc) at a density of 30,000 cells/cm2. The next day, media was replaced with<br>
fresh media containing 25 uM of TAMRA-CHH24O4-C1 and the cells were<br>
placed back into in a CQj incubator for 60 minutes. At the end of the<br>
incubation, media containing substrates was removed, cells were quickly washed<br>
with PBS (pH 7.4; four consecutive washes: 1.0 ml/cm2; 5 seconds each) and<br>
new media was added to the cells. The cells were placed back into in a COj<br>
incubator and after 60 minutes the cells were quickly washed with PBS (pH 7.4;<br>
four consecutive washes: 1.0 ml/cm2; 5 seconds each). Fluorescent images of<br>
the cells were taken on inverted epifluorescent microscope Axiovert-100 (Carl<br>
Zeiss) with filter sets appropriate for detection of GFP and TAMRA.<br>
Results<br>
As shown by the images in Figure 17, cells transfected with either GFPconnector-<br>
DhaA.WT-Flag or GFP-connector-DhaA.H272F-Flag showed robust<br>
expression of the protein(s) with light emitting characteristics of GFP. Analysis<br>
of the images of the same cells taken with a TAMRA-filter set showed that cells<br>
expressing GFP-connector-DhaA.WT-F.ag were dark and could not be<br>
distinguished from cells that do not express this fusion protein. In contrast, cells<br>
expressing GFP-connector-DhaA.H272F-Flag were very bright and<br>
unmistakably recognizable.<br>
Western blot analysis of proteins isolated from CHO-K1 cells transfected<br>
with GFP-connector-DhaA.WT-Flag or GFP-connector-DhaA.H272F-Flag<br>
vectors showed that these cells expressed proteins that were recognized by an<br>
anti-Flag antibody and had the predicted molecular weight for the fusion proteins<br>
(data not shown). A fluoroscan of the SDS-PAGE gel with these proteins<br>
showed strong/covalent binding of TAMRA to GFP-connector-DhaA.H272FFlag<br>
and no binding to GFP-connector-DhaA.WT-Flag (Figure 18).<br>
B. Fusion Partners of DhaA in DhaA.WT-Flag and DhaA.H272F-Flag are<br>
Fractional<br>
To determine whether fusion of two proteins leads to the loss of the<br>
activity of one or both proteins, several JDhaA-based fusion proteins (see Table<br>
II) with DhaA at the C- or N-terminus of the fusion and a connector sequence,<br>
e.g., one having 13 to 17 amino acids, between the two proteins, were prepared.<br>
The data showed that the functional activity of both proteins in the fusion was<br>
preserved.<br>
Table II<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
To study the toxicity of Cl-alkanes, CHO-K1 cells were plated in 96 well<br>
plates to a density of 5,000 cells per well. The next day, media was replaced<br>
with fresh media containing 0-100 uM concentrations of Cl-alkanes and the cells<br>
were placed back into a COz incubator for different periods of time. Viability of<br>
the cells was measured with CellTiter-Glo™ Luminescence Cell Viability Assay<br>
(Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Generally, 100 jj.1 of<br>
CellTiter-Glo™ reagent was added directly to the cells and the luminescence<br>
was recorded at 10 minutes using a DYNEX MLX microtiter plate luminometer.<br>
In some experiments, in order to prevent fluorescence/luminescence<br>
interference, the media containing fluorescent Cl-alkanes was removed and the<br>
cells were quickly washed with PBS (pH 7.4; four consecutive washes: 1.0<br>
ml/cm2; 5 seconds each) before addition of CellTiter-Glo™ reagent. Control<br>
experiments indicated that this procedure had no effect on the sensitivity or<br>
accuracy of the CellTiter-Glo™ assay.<br>
Results<br>
As shown in Figure 19, TAMRA-Ci/iEfoiCU-Cl showed no toxicity on<br>
CHO-K1 cells even after a 4 hour treatment at a 100 uM concentration the (the<br>
highest concentration tested). After a 24 hour treatment, no toxicity was<br>
detected at concentrations of 6.25 uM (the "maximum non-toxic<br>
concentration"). At concentrations &gt; 6.25 jiM, the relative luminescence in<br>
CHO-K1 cells was reduced in a dose-dependent manner with an ICjo of about<br>
100 uM. No toxicity of biotin-CuHMCU-Cl was observed even after 24 hours of<br>
treatment at 100 uM. In contrast, ROXS-Cnl^CVCl had a pronounced toxic<br>
effect as a reduction of the RLU in CHO-K1 cells could be detected after a 1<br>
hour treatment. The ICso value of this effect was about 75 jaM with no apparent<br>
ATP reduction at a 25 pM concentration. The ICso value of ROX5-Ci4H24O4-Cl<br>
toxicity and the "maximum non-toxic concentration" of ROXS-Cut^CU-Cl<br>
decreased in a time-dependent manner reaching 12.5 |iM and 6.25 uM,<br>
respectively.<br>
D. Detection of DhaA.D106C in CHO cells contacted with TAMRA- or DiAc-<br>
FAM-containing substrates and a fixative<br>
CHO cells (ATCC, passage 4) were seeded into 8-well chamber slides<br>
(German coverglass system) at low density in DMEM:F12 media (Gibco)<br>
containing 10% FBS and 1 mM glutamine (growth media) without antibiotics.<br>
Two days later, cells were inspected using an inverted phase microscope. Two<br>
visual criteria were confirmed before applying the transfection reagents: 1) the<br>
level of cellular confluence per chamber was approximately 60-80%, and 2)<br>
&gt;90% of the cells were adherent and showed a flattened morphology. The media<br>
was replaced with 150 ul of fresh pre-warmed growth media and cells were<br>
incubated for approximately 1 hour.<br>
Cells were transfected using the Transit TKO system (Miris). The TKO<br>
lipid was diluted by adding 7 ul of lipid per 100 ul of serum-free DMEM:F12<br>
media, and then 1.2 ug of transfection-grade DhaA.D106C DNA was added per<br>
100 ul of lipid containing media. The mixture was incubated at room<br>
temperature for 15 minutes, and then 25 ul aliquots were transferred into<br>
individual culture chambers (0.3 ug DNA). Cells were returned to the incubator<br>
for 5-6 hours, washed two times with growth media, 300 ul of fresh growth<br>
media was added, and then cells were incubated for an additional 24 hours.<br>
Transfected or non-transfected control cells were incubated with 12.5 uM<br>
TAMRA-Ci4H24O4-Cl or 12.5 uM DiAc-FAM-Ci4H24O4-Cl in 10%<br>
FBS/DMEM for 30 minutes at 37°C and 5%CO2. Cells were washed with warm<br>
growth media three times, 300 ul fresh growth media was added, and then cells<br>
were incubated for 1 hour.<br>
Growth media was replaced with warm PBS and live cells were<br>
visualized using a Zeiss Axiovert 100 inverted microscope equipped with a<br>
rhodamine filter set (Exciter filter= 540, Emission filter= 560LP) and a<br>
fluorescein filter set (Exciter filter= 490, Emission filter= 520), and a Spot CCD<br>
camera. Images were captured with exposure times of 0.15-0.60 seconds at gain<br>
settings of 4 or 16.<br>
Discreet and specifically labeled transfected cells were evident in both<br>
TAMRA-Ci4H24O4-Cl and DiAoFAM-Ci4H24O4-Cl labeled cells. The majority<br>
of cells were non-transfected cells and they did not retain the label.<br>
The PBS was removed and cells were fixed with 3.7%<br>
paraformaldehyde/0.1% Triton in PBS for 15 minutes. The fixative was<br>
removed, PBS was added, and a second set of images was captured for both<br>
TAMRA-Ci4H24O4-Cl and DiAc-FAM-Ci4H24O4-Cl labeled cells.<br>
The PBS was replaced with 50% methanol in PBS and cells were<br>
incubated for 15 minutes, followed by a 15 minute incubation in 95% methanol.<br>
A third set of images was captured and then an equal volume mixture of<br>
methanol and acetone was applied to the cells and incubated for 15 minutes. The<br>
media was replaced with PBS and a fourth set of images was collected.<br>
Results suggested that the binding of the substrates to the DhaA.D106C<br>
mutant was stable following fixation with paraformaldehyde and subsequent<br>
processing of fixed cell samples in methanol and acetone. Furthermore, the<br>
brightness of the TAMRA or FAM fluorescence was unchanged under these<br>
conditions.<br>
Example VI<br>
Mutant Beta-Lactamase fblaZVbased Tethering<br>
The serine-p-lactamases, enzymes that confer bacterial resistance to Plactam<br>
antibiotic, likely use the hydroxyl group of a serine residue (Ser70 in<br>
the class A consensus numbering scheme of Ambler et al. (1991)) to degrade a<br>
wide range of p-lactam compounds. The reaction begins with the formation of<br>
a precovalent encounter complex (Figure 20A), and moves through a highenergy<br>
acylation tetrahedral intermediate (Figure 20B) to form a transiently<br>
stable acyl-enzyme intermediate, forming an ester through the catalytic residue<br>
Ser70 (Figure 20C). Subsequently, the acyl-enzyme is attacked by hydrolytic<br>
water (Figure 20D) to form a high-energy deacylation intermediate (Figure<br>
20E) (Minasov et al., 2002), which collapses to form the hydrolyzed product<br>
(Figure 20F). The product is then expelled, regenerating free enzyme. As in<br>
serine proteases, this mechanism requires a catalytic base to activate the serine<br>
nucleophile to attack the amide bond of the substrate and, following formation<br>
of the acyl-enzyme intermediate, to activate the hydrolytic water for attack on<br>
the ester center of the adduct.<br>

GST-WoZ (WT and E166D, N170Q, or E166D:N170Q mutants) fusion<br>
cassettes were constructed by introducing point mutations into the blaZ gene and<br>
cloning the blaZ coding regions into SaWAgel sites of pGEXSx3 vector. The<br>
internal mutagenic primers were as follows: E166D (5'-<br>

(5'CCAGTTAGATATGACATAGAATTACAGTACTATTCACC-3'; SEQ ID<br>
NO:60 and 5'-GGTGAATAGTACTGTAATTCTATGTCATATCTAACTGG-3;<br>
SEQ ID NO:61). Two external primers (5'-<br>
CAACAGGTCGACGCCGCCATGAAAGAGTTAAATGATTTAG-3', SEQ ID<br>
NO:62; and 5'-GTAGTCACCGGTAAATTCCTTCATTACACTCTTGGC-3',<br>
SEQ ID NO:63) were designed to add N-termind Sail site and a Kozak sequence<br>
to the 5' coding region, add an Agel site to the 3' coding regions ofblaZ, and to<br>
amplify a 806 bp fragment from a WaZ.WT template. The resulting fragment<br>
was inserted into the Sali/Agel site of the vector pGEX-5X-3 containing a<br>
glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene, a sequence coding a Factor Xa cleavage<br>
site, and multiple cloning sites (MCS) followed by a sequence coding for Flag<br>
and stop codons. These gene fusion constructs were confirmed by DNA<br>
sequencing.<br>
The GST-WaZ (WT or mutants) fusion proteins were overexpressed in<br>
competent E. coll BL21 (X DBS) cells and purified essentially as described for<br>
DhaA and GST-DhaA fusion proteins (except the potassium phosphate buffer<br>
(0.1 M, pH 6.8) was used instead of Buffer A). Homogeneity of the proteins<br>
was verified by SDS-PAGE.<br>
The chromogenic substrate 6-p-[(Furylacryloyl)amido]penicillanic acid<br>
triethylamine salt (FAP) was purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA).<br>
Hydrolysis of FAP was monitored by loss of adsorbance at 344 nm (deltaE =<br>
1330 M"1 cm"1) on a Beckman Du640 spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter,<br>
Fullerton, CA). All assays were performed at 25°C in 0.1 M potassium<br>
phosphate buffer at pH 6.8.<br>
In CCF2, the cephalosporin core links a 7-hydroxycoumarin to a<br>
fluorescein. In the intact molecule, excitation of the coumarin (Eex- 409 nm)<br>
results in FRET to the fluorescein, which emits green light (Eem- 520 nm).<br>
Cleavage of CCF2 by p-lactamase results in spatial separation of the two dyes,<br>
disrupting FRET such that excitation of coumarin now gives rise to blue<br>
fluorescence (Bex- 447 nm). CCF2 was purchased from Aurora Biosciences<br>
Corporation (San Diego, CA). Reduction of the FRET signal and an increase in<br>
blue fluorescence were measured on Fluorescence Multi-well Plate Reader<br>
CytoFluorll (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA, USA).<br>
Results<br>
All p-lactamases, including p-lactamase from Staphylococcus aureus<br>
PCI, hydrolyze p-lactams of different chemical structure. The efficiency of<br>
hydrolysis depends on the type of the enzyme and chemical structure of the<br>
substrate. Penicillin is considered to be a preferred substrate for p-lactamase<br>
from Staphylococcus aureus PCI.<br>
The effect of point mutation(s) on the ability of P-lactamase to hydrolyze<br>
penicillins was studied as described in Zawadzke et al. (1995). As shown in<br>
Figure 20, a GST-p-lactamase PCI fusion protein efficiently hydrolyzed FAP.<br>
Hydrolysis of FAP by blaZ.E\66D, WaZ.N170Q or WaZ.E166D:N170Q blaZ<br>
mutants could not be detected even after 60 minutes of co-incubation.<br>
Therefore, these mutations lead to significant inactivation ofblaZ.<br>
To show that W0Z.E166D, WaZ.N170Q, or WaZ.E166D:N170Q mutants<br>
bind p-lactams, and therefore different functional groups could be tethered to<br>
these proteins via p-lactams, GST fusions of these mutants were incubated with<br>
BOCELLIN™ FL, a fluorescent penicillin (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR).<br>
Proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE and analyzed on fluoroimager (Hitachi,<br>
Japan) at an Em/Eon appropriate for the particular fluorophore. The data in<br>
Figure 22 show that all blaZ mutants bind bocellin. Moreover, the bond<br>
between blaZ mutants and fluorescent substrates was very strong, and probably<br>
covalent, since boiling with SDS followed by SDS-PAGE did not disrupt the<br>
bond. Also, the binding efficiency of double mutant WaZ.E166D:N170Q<br>
(judged by the strength of the fluorescent signal of protein-bound fluorophore)<br>
was much higher than binding efficiency of either of the single mutants, and the<br>
binding efficiency of WaZ.N170Q was higher than binding efficiency of<br>
blaZ.E\66D. These data, in combination with current understanding of the role<br>
of the individual amino acids in hydrolysis of beta-lactams, show that additional<br>
mutations (e.g., a mutation of an auxiliary amino acid) can improve efficiency of<br>
tethering of functional groups to a mutated protein.<br>
The effect of point mutation(s) on the ability of P-lactamase to hydrolyze<br>
cephalosporins was also studied using CCF2, a FRET-based substrate described<br>
by Zlokarnik et al. (1998). As shown in Figure 23, the GST-p-lactamase PCI<br>
fusion protein efficiently hydrolyzed CCF2 (lane 2). Single point mutations<br>
(i.e., E166D or N170Q) reduced the ability of the fusion proteins to hydrolyze<br>
CCF2 (lanes 3 and 4). The replacement of two amino acids<br>
(WaZ.El66D:N170Q mutants, lane 5) had an even more pronounced effect on<br>
the CCF2 hydrolysis. However, all blaZ mutants were capable of hydrolyzing<br>
CCF2.<br>
Thus, an amino acid substitution at position 166 or 170, e.g., Glul66Asp<br>
or AsnlTOGly enables the mutant beta-lactamase to trap a substrate and therefore<br>
tether the functional group of the substrate to the mutant beta-lactamase via a<br>
stable, e.g., covalent, bond. Moreover, mutation of an amino acid that has an<br>
auxiliary effect on EbO activation increased the efficiency of tethering.<br>

subcloned into the GFP-connector-DhaA.H272F-Flag construct at the<br>
Agel/Bamtil sites. The sequence of the gene fusion construct was confirmed by<br>
DNA sequencing.<br>
A DhaA.H272F-p-arrestin2 fusion cassette was constructed by replacing<br>
the pGFP2 coding region in Packard's vector encoding GFP2-p-arrestin2<br>
(Packard #6310176-1F1) with the DhaA.H272F-Flag coding region. Two<br>
primers (5'-ATTATGCTGAGTGATATCCC-3f; SEQ ID NO:39, and 5'-<br>
CTCGGTACCAAGCTCCTTGTAGTCA-31; SEQ ID NO:40) were designed to<br>
add a Kpnl site to the 3' coding region ofDhaA, and to amplify a 930 bp<br>
fragment from a pGEX5X-3.DhaA.H272F-Flag template. The pGFP2 coding<br>
region was excised with Nhel and Kpnl restriction enzymes, then the 930 bp<br>
fragment containing encoding DhaA.H272F was inserted into the Nhel and Kpnl<br>
sites of the GFP2-{i-arrestin2 coding vector. The sequence of the fusion<br>
construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing.<br>
CHO-K1 or 3T3 cells transiently expressing GFP-connector-<br>
DhaA.H272F-NLS3, GFP2-|J-arrestin2 or DhaA.H272F-p-arrestin2 fusion<br>
proteins were plated in LT-II chambers (Nunc) at a density of 30,000 cells/cm2.<br>
The next day, media was replaced with fresh media containing 25 |iM of<br>
TAMRA-CnHbCVCl and the cells were placed back into &amp;CO2 incubator for<br>
60 minutes. At the end of the incubation, substrate media was removed, cells<br>
were quickly washed with PBS (pH 7.4; four consecutive washes: 1 .0 ml/cm2; 5<br>
seconds each), and new media was added to the cells. The cells were placed<br>
back into a CQj incubator and after 60 minutes the cells were quickly washed<br>
with PBS (pH 7.4; 1.0 ml/cm2). Fluorescent images of the cells were taken on<br>
confocal microscope Pascal- 5 (Carl Zeiss) with filter sets appropriate for the<br>
detection of GFP and TAMRA.<br>
Results<br>
As shown by the images in Figure 24, GFP and TAMRA were colocalized<br>
in the cell nucleus of cells expression GFP-connector-DhaA.H272FNLS3<br>
and contacted with TAMRA-Ci4H24O4-Cl.<br>
As shown by the images in Figure 25, GFP-p-arrestin2 expressing cells<br>
have a typical p-arrestin2 cytosolic localization. A fluoroscan of the SDS-PAGE<br>
gel of DhaA.H272F-p-arrestin2 showed strong binding of a TAMRA containing<br>
DhaA substrate to cells expressing DhaA.H272F-p-arrestin2.<br>
Site-Directe4 Mutagenesis of DhaA Catalytic Residue 130<br>
Haloalkane dehalogenases use a three-step mechanism for cleavage of<br>
the carbon-halogen bond. This reaction is catalyzed by a triad of amino acid<br>
residues composed of a nucleopbile, base and acid which, for the haloalkane<br>
dehalogenase fiomXanthobacter autotrophicus (DhlA), are residues Asp 124,<br>
His289 and Asp260, respectively (Franken et al., 1991), and in Rhodococcus<br>
dehalogenase enzyme (DhaA), Aspl06, His272 and GlulSO (Newman et al.,<br>
1999).<br>
Unlike the haloalkane dehalogenase nucleophile and base residues, the<br>
role of the third member of the catalytic triad is not yet fully understood. The<br>
catalytic acid is hydrogen bonded to the catalytic His residue and may assist the<br>
His residue in its function by increasing the basicity of nitrogen in the imidazole<br>
ring. Krooshof et al. (1997), using site-directed mutagenesis to study the role of<br>
the DhlA catalytic acid Asp260, demonstrated that a D260N mutant was<br>
catalytically inactive. Furthermore, this residue apparently had an important<br>
structural role since the mutant protein accumulated mainly in inclusion bodies.<br>
The haloalkane dehalogenase from Sphinogomonas paucimobilis (LinB) is the<br>
enzyme involved in y-hexachlorocyclohexane degradation (Nagata et al., 1997).<br>
Hynkova et al., (1999) replaced the putative catalytic residue (Glu-132) of the<br>
LinB with glutamine (Q) residue. However, no activity was observed for the<br>
E132Q mutant even at very high substrate conpentrations.<br>
To examine the role of the DhaA catalytic triad acid GlulSO in protein<br>
production and on the ability of the mutant protein to form covalent alkylenzyme<br>
intermediates with a fluorescent-labeled haloalkane substrate, sitedirected<br>
mutagenesis was employed to replace the DhaA glutamate (E) residue at<br>
position 130 with glutamine, leucine and alanine.<br>

Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange Multi kit<br>
according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The<br>
mutagenesis reactions were introduced into competent E. coli XL10 Gold cells<br>
and transtbrmants were selected on LB agar plates containing ampicillin (100<br>
Hg/mL). Plasmid DNA isolated from individual transformants was initially<br>
screened for the loss of an EcoRl site due to replacement of the glutamate codon<br>
(GAAttc). Clones suspected of containing the desired codon change from each<br>
reaction were selected and subjected to DNA sequence analysis (SeqWright,<br>
Houston, TX). The primer used to confirm the sequence of the mutants in the<br>
pGEX5X3 vector was as follows: 5' GGGCTGGCAAGCCACGTTTGGTG 3'<br>
(SEQIDNO:44).<br>
DhaA mutant analysis. The three DhaA El30 substitution mutants were<br>
compared to the following constructs: Wild-type DhaA, DhaA.H272F, and a<br>
DhaA negative control (pGEX5X3 vector only). Overnight cultures of each<br>
clone were grown in 2 mL of LB containing ampicillin (100 jig/mL) by shaking<br>
at 30°C. The overnight cultures were diluted 1:50 into a sterile flask containing<br>
50 mL fresh LB medium and ampicillin (100 ug/mL). The cultures were<br>
incubated with shaking at 25°C to minimize the production of insoluble protein<br>
species. When the cultures reached mid-log phase (ODeoo^-fi), IPTG (0.1 mM)<br>
was added and the cultures were incubated with shaking at 25°C for an<br>
additional 22 hours. For labeling of whole cells with a tetramethylrhodamine<br>
(TAMRA) haloalkane conjugated substrate, the cell density of each culture was<br>
adjusted to ODeoo^l prior to adding substrate to a concentration of 15 nM. The<br>
cells were incubated with gentle agitation at 4°C for approximately 18 hours.<br>
Following incubation, 20 ul of cells from each labeling reaction was added to 6<br>
ul of 4X SDS loading dye and the samples were boiled for about 3 minutes prior<br>
to being loaded onto a 4-20% acrylamide gel (Tris glycine). For in vitro labeling<br>
studies, crude lysates of IPTG induced cultures were prepared by collecting 3<br>
mL of cells (ODeoo-l) and resuspending the resulting pellet in 75 uL PBS.<br>
Following a freeze/thaw step, 225 uL of IX Cell Culture Lysis Reagent<br>
(Promega Corp., Madison, WI) containing 1.25 mg/mL lysozyme was added to<br>
facilitate lysis of the cells. A 20 uL sample of each lysate was combined with 25<br>
uL of IX PBS. The TAMRA labeled haloalkane substrate was added to a final<br>
concentration of 25 uM. The labeling reactions were incubated at room<br>
temperature for 2 hours. A 25 ul sample of each labeling reaction was added to<br>
6 fil of 4X SDS loading dye and the samples were boiled for about 3 minutes<br>
prior to being loaded onto a 4-20% acrylamide gel (Tris glycine). The gels were<br>
imaged using a Fluorlmager SI instrument (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway,<br>
NJ) set to detect emission at 570 nm.<br>
Cell-free lysates were generated by centrifugation of crude lysates for 15<br>
minutes at 14,000 RPM. Protein production was monitored by SDS-PAGE and<br>
Western blot analysis. Proteins transferred to a PVDF membrane were<br>
incubated with an anti-FLAGR antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase<br>
(AP) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The blot was developed with the Western Blue<br>
stabilized substrate for alkaline phosphatase (Promega Corp., Madison, WI).<br>
Results<br>
The role of the DhaA catalytic acid hi the hydrolysis of the alkyl-enzyme<br>
intermediate was probed by site-directed mutagenesis. The DhaA codon E130<br>
was replaced with a codon for glutamine (Q), leucine (L) or alanine (A), as these<br>
substitutions would likely be least disruptive to the structure of the enzyme.<br>
Following mutagenesis, restriction endonuclease screening and DNA sequence<br>
analysis was used to verify the desired codon changes. Sequence verified<br>
DhaA.EBOQ, DhaA.E130L and DhaA.E130A clones, designated Cl, A5 and<br>
A12, respectively, were chosen for further analysis. The E130 mutants were<br>
analyzed for protein expression and for their ability to form a covalent alkylenzyme<br>
intermediate with a TAMRA labeled haloalkane substrate. The three<br>
E130 gene variants were over-expressed in E. coli JM109 cells following<br>
induction with IPTG. SDS-PAGE analysis of crude cell lysates showed that<br>
cultures expressing the wild-type and mutant dhaA genes accumulated protein to<br>
approximately the same level (Figure 26; lanes 2,4,6, 8,10, and 12).<br>
Furthermore, the DhaA protein that was produced by the wild-type and H272F<br>
constructs was for the most part soluble since the amount of protein did not<br>
change appreciably after centrifugation (Figure 26; lanes 3 and 5). The abundant<br>
22 kDa protein bands present in the vector only lanes (Figure 26; lanes 6 and 7)<br>
represented the GST protein. These results, however, are in stark contrast to the<br>
DhaA.E130Q, DhaA.E130L and DhaA.E130A mutants that appeared to<br>
accumulate predominantly insoluble DhaA protein. This conclusion is based on<br>
the observation that after centrifugation, there was a significant loss in the<br>
amount of DhaA protein present in cell-free lysates (Figure 26; lanes 9,11, and<br>
13). Nevertheless, a protein band that comigrates with DhaA was clearly<br>
observed in each DhaA.ElSO mutant lanes after centrifugation (+s) suggesting<br>
the presence of soluble enzyme. Western analysis was, therefore, used to<br>
determine if the protein bands observed in the DhaA.ElSO mutants following<br>
centrifugation represented soluble DhaA material. The immunoblot shown in<br>
Figure 27 confirmed the presence of soluble DhaA protein in each of the<br>
DhaA.E130 mutant cell-free lysates (lanes 9,11, and 13).<br>
The DhaA.ElSO mutants were also examined for their ability to generate<br>
an alkyl-enzyme covalent intermediate. Crude lysates prepared from IPTG<br>
induced cultures of the various constructs were incubated in the presence of the<br>
TAMRA labeled substrate. Figure 28 showed that the DhaA.H272F mutant<br>
(lane 3) was very efficient at producing this intermediate. No such product<br>
could be detected with either the WT DhaA or negative control lysates. Upon<br>
initial examination, the DhaA.ElSO mutants did not appear to produce detectable<br>
levels of the covalent product. However, upon closer inspection of the<br>
fluoroimage extremely faint bands were observed that could potentially represent<br>
minute amounts of the covalent intermediate (Figure 28; lanes 5-7). Based on<br>
these results, the ability of whole cells to generate a covalent, fluorescent alkylenzyme<br>
intermediate was investigated.<br>
Figure 29 shows the results of an in vivo labeling experiment comparing<br>
each of the DhaA.ElSO mutants with positive (DhaA.H272F mutant) and<br>
negative (DhaA-) controls. As expected, the DhaA.H272F mutant was capable<br>
of generating a covalent alkyl-enzyme intermediate as evidenced by the single<br>
fluorescent band near the molecular weight predicted for the GST-DhaA-Flag<br>
fusion (Figure 29, lane 3). As previously observed with the in vitro labeling<br>
results, no such product could be detected with either the wild-type or negative<br>
control cultures (Figure 29, lanes 2 and 3) but very faint fluorescent bands<br>
migrating at the correct position were again detected with all three DhaA.ElSO<br>
substituted mutants (Figure 29, lanes 5-7). These results point to the possibility<br>
that the DhaA.ElSOQ, L and A mutants have the ability to trap covalent alkylenzyme<br>
intermediates. The efficiency of this reaction, however, appears to<br>
proceed at a dramatically reduced rate compared to the DhaA.H272F mutant<br>
enzyme.<br>
The results of this mutagenesis study suggest that the DhaA catalytic acid<br>
residue DhaA.ElSO plays an important structural role in the correct folding of<br>
the enzyme. The DhaA protein was clearly sensitive to substitutions at this<br>
amino acid position as evidenced by the presence of largely insoluble protein<br>
complexes in the DhaA.ElSOQ, DhaA.ElSOL and DhaA.ElSOA crude lysates.<br>
Nevertheless, based on SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analyses, a significant<br>
quantity of soluble DhaA protein was detected in the cell-free lysates of all three<br>
DhaA.El 30 mutants.<br>

Capturing of DhaA.H272F-Flag and DhaA.H272F-Flag Renilla Luciferase<br>
Fusion Proteins Expressed in Living Mammalian Cells<br>
Materials and Methods<br>
CHO-K1 cells were plated in 24 well plates (Labsystems) at a density of<br>
30,000 cells/cm2 and transfected with a pCIneo.DhaA.WT-Flag or<br>
pCIneo.hRLuc-connector-DhaA.H272F-Flag vector. Twenty-four hours later,<br>
media was replaced with fresh media containing 25 uM biotin-CigHsiO/t-Cl and<br>
0.1% DMSO, or 0.1% DMSO alone, and the cells were placed in a COa<br>
incubator for 60 minutes. At the end of the incubation, the media was removed,<br>
cells were quickly washed with PBS (pH 7.4; four consecutive washes; 1.0<br>
ml/cm2; 5 seconds each) and new media was added to the cells. In some<br>
experiments, the media was not changed. The cells were placed back in a CCh<br>
incubator.<br>
After 60 minutes, media was removed, and the cells were collected in<br>
PBS (pH=7.4,200 ul/well, RT) containing protease inhibitors (Sigma #P8340).<br>
The cells were lysed by trituriation through a needle (IM1 23GTW). Then, cell<br>
lysates were incubated with MagnaBind Streptavidin coated beads (Pierce<br>
#21344) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cell lysates were<br>
incubated with beads for 60 minutes at room temperature (RT) using a rotating<br>
disk. Unbound material was collected; beads were washed with PBS (3 x 500<br>
ul, pH=7.4, RT) and resuspended in SDS-sample buffer (for SDS-PAGE<br>
analysis) or PBS (pH=7.4, for determination of R.Luc activity). Proteins were<br>
resolved on SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, analyzed with<br>
anti-Flag-Ab or anti-R.Luc-Ab, and bound antibody detected by an enhanced<br>
chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Pharmacia-Amersham). Activity of hR.Luc<br>
bound to beads was determined using Promega's "Renilla Luciferase Assay<br>
System" according to the manufacturer's protocol.<br>
Results<br>
Capturing of proteins expressed in living cells allows for analysis of<br>
those proteins with a variety of analytic methods/techniques. A number of<br>
capturing tools are available although most of those tools require generation of a<br>
highly specific antibody or genetically fusing a protein of interest with specific<br>
tag peptides/proteins (Jarvik and Telmer, 1998; Ragaut et al., 1999). However,<br>
those tags have only limited use for live cell imaging. To capture DhaA.H272F<br>
and functional proteins fused to DhaA.H272F, SA-coated beads were used<br>
(Savage et al., 1992).<br>
Biotin-CigHazCVCl was efficiently hydrolyzed by wild-type DhaA, and<br>
covalently bound to DhaA.H272F and DhaA.H272F fusion proteins in vitro and<br>
in vivo. Moreover, binding was observed both in E. coli and in mammalian<br>
cells. Control experiments indicated that about 80% of the DhaA.H272F-Flag<br>
protein expressed in CHO-K1 cells was labeled after a 60 minute treatment.<br>
CHO-K1 cells transiently expressing DhaA.H272F-Flag were treated<br>
with biotin-CuHaaCVCl. Biotin-CigHsaCVCl treated cells were lysed and cell<br>
lysates were incubated with SA-coated beads. Binding of DhaA.H272F to beads<br>
was analyzed by Western blot using anti-Flag11 antibody. As shown in Figure<br>
30D, DhaA.H272F-Flag capturing was not detected in the absence of biotin-<br>
CigH32O4-Cl treatment. At the same time, more than 50% of the DhaA.H272FFlag<br>
expressed in cells was captured on SA-coated beads if the cells were treated<br>
To show the capturing of functionally active proteins fused to<br>
DhaA.H272F-Flag, cells were transfected with a vector encoding hR.Lucconnector-<br>
DhaA.H272F-Flag, and the luciferase activity captured on the beads<br>
measured. As shown in Figure 30C, significant luciferase activity was detected<br>
on beads incubated with a lysate of Motin-CigHazO^Cl treated cells. At the<br>
same time, no luciferase activity was detected on beads incubated with a lysate<br>
from cells that were not treated with biotin-CigHsaCVCl. Moreover, no hR.Luc<br>
activity was detected on beads incubated with lysate from the cells treated with<br>
biotin-CigHsaCU-Cl when free biotin-CigHsaCVCl was not washed out.<br>
Taken together, these data show that functionally active protein (hRXuc)<br>
fused to the DhaA.H272F can be efficiently captured using biotin-CigHsaCVCl<br>
and SA-coated beads. The capture is biotin-dependent, and can be competed-off<br>
by excess of biotin-CigHsaO^Cl. As a significant inhibitory effect of the beads<br>
on the hR.Luc activity was observed (data not shown), SDS-PAGE and Western<br>
blot analysis with anti-R.Luc antibody were used to estimate the efficiency of<br>
capture of hR.Luc-connector-DhaA.H272F-Flag fusion protein. As shown in<br>
Figure 30D, more than 50 % of hR.Luc-connector-DhaA.H272F-Flag fusion<br>
protein can be captured in biotin-dependent manner. This is in good agreement<br>
with the capturing efficiency of DhaA.H272F-Flag (see Figure 30A).<br>
Example ft<br>
Optimized DhaA Gene<br>
DhaA General Sequence Design<br>
A synthetic DAoA.H272F gene was prepared which had a human codon<br>
bias, low CG content, selected restriction enzyme recognition sites and a reduced<br>
number of transcription regulatory sites. Relative to the amino sequence<br>
encoded by a wild-type DhaA gene which lacks a signal sequence (SEQ ID<br>
NO:51), and/or to Z)/iaA.H272F, the amino acid sequence of a codon-optimized<br>
DhaA gene and flanking sequences included: 1) a Gly inserted at position 2, due<br>
to introduction of an improved Kozak sequence (GCCACCATGG; SEQ ED<br>
N0:45) and a BamHI site (thus the H272F active site mutation in DhaA mutants<br>
with the Gly insertion is at position 273); 2) a A292G substitution due to<br>
introduction of a SmallXmallAval site which, in the DhaA. mutant with the Gly<br>
insertion, is at position 293; 3) the addition of Ala-Gly at the C-terminus due to<br>
introduction of a Nael (JVgoMIV) site; 4) the addition ofNhel, Pvull, EcoRV and<br>
Ncol sites in the 5' flanking sequence; 5) the addition of NNNN in the 5' flanking<br>
sequence to eliminate search algorithm errors at the end and to maintain the<br>
ORF1 (i.e., NNN-NGC-TAG-CCA-GCT-GGC-GAT-ATC-GCC-ACC-ATGGGA;<br>
SEQ ID NO:46); 6) at the 3' end a Notl site, the addition of NNNN to<br>
eliminate search algorithm errors at the end, aPocI site with ORF Leu-Ile-Lys,<br>
and two stop codons, at least one of which is a TAA (i.e.,<br>
TAATAGTTAATTAAGTAAGCGGCCGCNNNN; SEQ ID NO:47).<br>

Codon Selection<br>
Codon usage data was obtained from the Codon Usage Database<br>
(http://www.kazusa.or.jp/codonA. which is based on: GenBank Release 131.0 of<br>
15 August 2002 (See, Nakamura et al., 2000). Codon usage tables were<br>
downloaded for HS: Homo sapiens [gbpri] 50,031 CDS's (21,930,294 codons);<br>
MM: Mus musculus [gbrod] 23,113 CDS's (10,345,401 codons); EC:<br>
Escherichia coli [gbbct] 11,985 CDS's (3,688,954 codons); and EC K12:<br>
Escherichia coli K12 [gbbct] 4,291 CDS's (1,363,716 codons). HS and MM<br>
were compared and found to be closely similar, thus the HS table was used. EC<br>
and EC K12 were compared and found to be closely similar, therefore the EC<br>
K12 table was employed.<br>
The overall strategy for selecting codons was to adapt codon usage for<br>
optimal expression in mammalian cells while avoiding low-usage E. coli codons.<br>
One "best" codon was selected for each amino acid and used to back-translate<br>
the desired protein sequence to yield a starting gene sequence. Another selection<br>
criteria was to avoid high usage frequency HS codons which contain CG<br>
dinucleotides, as methylation of CG has been implicated in transcriptional gene<br>
regulation and can cause down-regulation of gene expression in stable cell lines.<br>
Thus, all codons containing CG (8 human codons) and TA (4 human codons,<br>
except for Tyr codons) were excluded. Codons ending in C were also avoided as<br>
they might form a CG with a downstream codon. Of the remaining codons,<br>
those with highest usage in HS were selected, unless a codon with a slightly<br>
lower usage had substantially higher usage in E. coli.<br>
DhaA Gene Sequences<br>
To generate a starting DhaA. sequence, codon usage tables in Vector NTI<br>
8.0 (Informax) were employed. The DhaA.v2.1 protein sequence (SEQ ID<br>
NO:48) was back translated to create a starting gene sequence, hD/wA.v2.1-0,<br>
and flanking regions were then added, as described above, to create hD/iaA.v2.1 -<br>
OF (SEQ ID NO:49).<br>

Strategy fop Removal of Sequence Motifs<br>
The undesired sequence motifs specified above were removed from the<br>
starting gene sequence by selecting alternate codons that allowed retention of the<br>
specified protein and flanking sequences. Alternate codons were selected in a<br>
way to conform to the overall codon selection strategy as much as possible.<br>
A. General Steps<br>
- Identify undesired sequence matches with Matlnspector using matrix family<br>
subset "DhaA" or "DhaA-EC" and with Modellnspector using default<br>
settings.<br>
- Identify possible replacement codons to remove undesired sequence matches<br>
with SequenceShaper (keep ORF).<br>
Incorporate all changes into a new version of the synthetic gene sequence<br>
and re-analyze with Matlnspector and Modellnspector.<br>
B. Specific Steps<br>
- Remove undesired sequence matches using subset "DhaA-EC" and<br>
SequenceShaper default remaining thresholds (0.70/Opt-0.20).<br>
- For sequence matches that cannot be removed with this approach use lower<br>
SequenceShaper remaining thresholds (e.g., 0.70/Opt-0.05).<br>
- For sequence matches that still cannot be removed, try different<br>
combinations of manually chosen replacement codons (especially if more<br>
than 3 base changes might be needed). If that introduces new sequence<br>
matches, try to remove those using the steps above (a different starting<br>
sequence sometimes allows a different removal solution).<br>
- Use subset "DhaA" to check whether problematic E. coli sequences motifs<br>
were introduced, and if so try to remove them using an analogous approach<br>
to that described above for non E. coli sequences.<br>
Use an analogous strategy for the flanking (non-open reading frame) sequences.<br>
C. Identification and Removal of Putative CpG Islands<br>
Software used: EMBOSS CpGPlot / CpGReport<br>
http://www.ebi.ac.uk/emooss/op8plot/index.htmD (see, Gardiner-Garden et al.,<br>
1987).<br>
Parameters: default (modified): Window: 100; Step: 1; Obs/Exp: 0.6;<br>
MinPC: 50; Length: 100; Reverse: no; Complement: no. After the removal of<br>
undesked sequence motifs, the gene sequence was checked for putative CpG<br>
islands of at least 100 bases using the software described above. If CpG islands<br>
were identified, they were removed by selecting, at some of the CG dinucleotide<br>
positions, alternate codons that allowed retention of the specified<br>
protein and flanking sequences, but did not introduce new undesired sequence<br>
motifs.<br>
D. Restriction Sites<br>
A unique Murii/Mfel (C'AATTG) site was introduced to allow removal of<br>
the C-terminal 34 amino acids, including a putative myristylation site (GSEIAR)<br>
near the C-terminus. Another unique site, a Nrul site, was introduced to allow<br>
removal of the C-terminal 80-100 amino acids.<br>

The other sequence motifs remaining in hDhaA.v2.1-6F in the open<br>
reading frame were for an E. coli RBS (AAGG) l ib upstream of a Met codon<br>
which was not removed due to retain the protein sequence (Lys-Gly: AA(A/G)-<br>
GGN), and a BsmAl restriction site (GTCTC) which was riot removed due to<br>
introduction of transcription factor binding site sequences.<br>

genes was analyzed as in EMBOSS CpGPlot/CpGReport with default<br>
parameters, and the results are shown in Table VI.<br>
