				<td>RELEASE AGENT FOR TRANSPARENT POLYIMIDE BLENDS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to miscible blends of polyimides with resorcinol based polyesters or resorcinol based polyester carbonate polymers and alkyl amide compounds. Such mixtures having improved melt flow, good mold release from metal tooling along with transparency and resistance to heat.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Blending of polymers to make new compositions is well known. However finding polymer pairs that give useful mechanical properties is difficult. The unfavorable free energy of mixing for large polymeric molecules usually gives blends where the two polymers are separated from each other and have little or no affinity. These blends have poor mechanical properties and are not very useful for making molded articles or films. In some very limited instances two polymers show enough affinity to give sufficient adhesion between the two polymers such that blends with good mechanical properties are obtained. These are compatible blends. In very rare instances the polymers have sufficient affinity to overcome the unfavorable thermodynamics of mixing and form an intimate mixture where the two polymers are dissolved in one another. Such miscible blends are very useful in that they are transparent and often show good mechanical and rheological properties. Despite years of experimentation it is still very hard to predict, a priori, polymer miscibility.<br>
However, even such miscible blends may still suffer from non-optimal performance in certain aspects of behavior such as mold release from metal tooling as well as the need for high flow. The combination of high flow and good release is especially important in making resin compositions for molding into long thin sections, for example electrical connectors, which need high flow, and due to the large surface area to volume, need good release characteristics so they will not stick and deform while being removed from the mold. In even more demanding applications such mixtures should also retain transparency, high refractive index (RI) and high heat resistance,<br>
for example as shown in percent transmission (%T &gt; 50%), RI greater than 1.60 and glass transition temperature (Tg) &gt; 180 °C respectively. Thus there is a need for transparent high heat resin which combine good melt flow, high heat and efficient release characteristics from the mold.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
We have found that a surprisingly small change in aryl polyester and aryl polyester carbonate structures allows one to go from blends that are phase separated and opaque to blends that are fully miscible and transparent. Incorporation of aryl ester linkages based on resorcinol, rather than bisphenol A (BPA), gives polyester carbonates that are surprisingly miscible with polyimides, especially polyetherimides.<br>
Even more surprising addition of certain alkyl amides in such blends gives higher flow and excellent mold release while still having high clarity and low haze.<br>
Such miscible bends with polyimides are best achieved in compositions where the polyester carbonates or polyarylates contain at least about 50 mole % resorcinol based aryl ester linkages.<br>
Blends further containing alkyl amides have exceptionally high melt flow and release along with a high glass transition temperature and high heat distortion (HDT) temperatures. The miscible blends with the alkyl amide compounds show good optical properties with high percent transmittance. Color is reduced compared to the base polyimide resins and melt processability is improved.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In one embodiment the composition will comprise a miscible polymer blend of:<br>
a)	a resin selected from the group consisting of resorcinol based polyester carbonates, resorcinol based polyarylates and mixtures thereof,<br>
b)	at least one alkyl amide compound with a molecular weight from 250 to 1000 and<br>
c)        one or more polyimide resins,<br>
wherein said polyester carbonates and polyarylates have at least 50 mole% aryl ester linkages derived from resorcinol, and wherein the composition has a percent transmission, as measured at 3.2mm, using ASTM method D1003, of greater than or equal to 50%.<br>
In another embodiment the composition will comprise 1 to 99% by weight of the entire mixture one or more of a resorcinol based polyarylate resin and 99 to 1 wt % of one or more polyimide resins. The resorcinol based polyarylate resin should contain at least about 50 mole% of units derived from the reaction product of resorcinol, or functionalized resorcinol, with an aryl dicarboxylic acid or dicarboxylic acid derivatives suitable for the formation of aryl ester linkages, for example, carboxylic acid halides, carboxylic acid esters and carboxylic acid salts.<br>
In another embodiment the composition will have a percent transmittance of greater than or equal to about 65% and a glass transition temperature (Tg) of greater than or equal to about 180 °C. The miscible polyetherimide - resorcinol based polyarylates or resorcinol based polyester carbonate blends with alkyl amide compounds will show high clarity and low haze and improved melt flow compared to the base polyimide -resorcinol based polyestercarbonate resin blends.<br>
The resorcinol based polyarylate may further contain carbonate linkages derived from reaction of a bisphenol and a carbonate forming species, such as phosgene making a polyester carbonate copolymer.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention resorcinol polyarylate carbonate copolymers will be comprised of the reaction products of iso and tere phthalic acid, resorcinol and optionally, bisphenol A and phosgene. In one aspect the resorcinol polyester carbonate copolymer will be made in such a way that the number of bisphenol dicarboxylic ester linkages is minimized, for example by pre-reacting the resorcinol moiety with the dicarboxylic acid moiety to form a polyester block and then reacting a said block with the bisphenol and carbonate moiety to form the polycarbonate part of the copolymer.<br>
Some compositions of note will have 10 to 50% resorcinol based polyester with from 50 to 90% polyimide based on the weight of the whole blend composition.<br>
In one of its aspects the composition of the present invention is comprised of polymers containing arylate polyester chain members. Said chain members comprise at least one diphenol residue in combination with at least one aromatic dicarboxylic acid residue. In one embodiment the diphenol residue is derived from a 1,3-dihydroxybenzene moiety, as illustrated in Formula I, commonly referred to throughout this specification as resorcinol or resorcinol moiety. Resorcinol or resorcinol moiety as used within the context of the present invention should be understood to include both unsubstituted 1,3-dihydroxybenzene and substituted 1,3-dihydroxybenzenes unless explicitly stated otherwise.<br><br>

Suitable tertiary amines include triethylamine, dimethylbutylamine, diisopropylethylamine, 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine, and mixtures thereof. Other contemplated tertiary amines include N-C1-C6-alkyl-pyrrolidines, such as N-ethylpyrrolidine, N-C1-C6-piperidines, such as N-ethylpiperidine, N-methylpiperidine, and N-isopropylpiperidine, N-C1-C6-morpholines, such as N-ethylmorpholine and N-isopropyl-morpholine, N-C1-C6-dihydroindoles, N-C1-C6-dihydroisoindoles, N-C1-C6-tetrahydroquinolines, N-C1-C6-tetrahydroisoquinolines, N-C1-C6-benzo-morpholines, l-azabicyclo-[3.3.0]-octane, quinuclidine, N-C1-C6-alkyl-2-azabicyclo-[2.2.1]-octanes, N-C1-C6-alkyl-2-azabicyclo-[3.3.1]-nonanes, and N-C1-C6-alkyl-3-azabicyclo-[3.3.1 ]-nonanes, N,N,N',N'-tetraalkylalkylene-diamines, including N,N,N',N'-tetraethyl-l,6-hexanediamine.

(Formula Removed)<br>
Formula V<br>
Either or both of isophthaloyl and terephthaloyl dichlorides may be present. In some embodiments the dicarboxylic acid dichlorides comprise mixtures of isophthaloyl and terephthaloyl dichloride in a molar ratio of isophthaloyl to terephthaloyl of about 0.25 to 4.0:1; in other embodiments the molar ratio is about 0.4 to 2.5:1; and in still other embodiments the molar ratio is about 0.67 to 1.5:1.<br>
Dicarboxylic acid halides provide only one method of preparing the polymers on the invention. Other routes to make the resorcinol arylate linkages are also contemplated using, for example, the dicarboxylic acid, a dicarboxylic acid ester, especially an activated ester, or dicarboxylate salts or partial salts.<br>
At least one chain-stopper (also referred to sometimes hereinafter as capping agent) may also be present in the method and compositions of the invention. A purpose of adding at least one chain-stopper is to limit the molecular weight of polymer comprising resorcinol arylate polyester chain members, thus providing polymer with controlled molecular weight and favorable processability. Typically, at least one chain-stopper is added when the resorcinol arylate-containing polymer is not required to have reactive end-groups for further application. In the absence of chain-stopper<br>
resorcinol arylate-containing polymer may be either used in solution or recovered from solution for subsequent use such as in copolymer formation which may require the presence of reactive end-groups, typically hydroxy, on the resorcinol-arylate polyester segments. A chain-stopper may be at least one of mono-phenolic compounds, mono-carboxylic acid chlorides, and/or mono-chloroformates. Typically, the chain-stopper may be present in quantities of 0.05 to 10 mole %, based on resorcinol moieties in the case of mono-phenolic compounds or based on acid dichlorides in the case of mono-carboxylic acid chlorides and/or mono-chloroformates.<br>
Suitable mono-phenolic compounds include monocyclic phenols, such as phenol, C1-C22 alkyl-substituted phenols, p-cumyl-phenol, p-tertiary-butyl phenol, hydroxy diphenyl; monoethers of diphenols, such as p-methoxyphenol. Alkyl-substituted phenols include those with branched chain alkyl substituents having 8 to 9 carbon atoms as described in U.S. Patent 4,334,053. In some embodiments mono-phenolic chain-stoppers are phenol, p-cumylphenol, and resorcinol monobenzoate.<br>
Suitable mono-carboxylic acid chlorides include monocyclic, mono-carboxylic acid chlorides, such as benzoyl chloride, C1-C22 alkyl-substituted benzoyl chloride, toluoyl chloride, halogen-substituted benzoyl chloride, bromobenzoyl chloride, cinnamoyl chloride, 4-nadimidobenzoyl chloride, and mixtures thereof; polycyclic, mono-carboxylic acid chlorides, such as trimellitic anhydride chloride, and naphthoyl chloride; and mixtures of monocyclic and polycyclic mono-carboxylic acid chlorides. The chlorides of aliphatic monocarboxylic acids with up to 22 carbon atoms are also suitable. Functionalized chlorides of aliphatic monocarboxylic acids, such as acryloyl chloride and methacryoyl chloride, are also suitable. Suitable mono-chloroformates include monocyclic, mono-chloroformates, such as phenyl chloroformate, alkyl-substituted phenyl chloroformate, p-cumyl phenyl chloroformate, toluene chloroformate, and mixtures thereof.<br>
A chain-stopper can be combined together with the resorcinol moieties, can be contained in the solution of dicarboxylic acid dichlorides, or can be added to the reaction mixture after production of a precondensate. If mono-carboxylic acid<br>
chlorides and/or mono-chloroformates are used as chain-stoppers, they are often introduced together with dicarboxylic acid dichlorides. These chain-stoppers can also be added to the reaction mixture at a moment when the chlorides of dicarboxylic acid have already reacted substantially or to completion. If phenolic compounds are used as chain-stoppers, they can be added in one embodiment to the reaction mixture during the reaction, or, in another embodiment, before the beginning of the reaction between resorcinol moiety and acid chloride moiety. When hydroxy-terminated resorcinol arylate-containing precondensate or oligomers are prepared, then chain-stopper may be absent, or only present in small amounts, to aid control of oligomer molecular weight.<br>
In another embodiment the invention may encompass the inclusion of at least one branching agent such as a trifunctional or higher functional carboxylic acid chloride and/or trifunctional or higher functional phenol. Such branching agents, if included, can typically be used in quantities of 0.005 to 1 mole %, based on dicarboxylic acid dichlorides or resorcinol moieties used, respectively. Suitable branching agents include, for example, trifunctional or higher carboxylic acid chlorides, such as trimesic acid tri acid chloride, 3,3',4,4'-benzophenone tetracarboxylic acid tetrachloride, 1,4,5,8-naphthalene tetracarboxylic acid tetrachloride or pyromellitic acid tetrachloride, and trifunctional or higher phenols, such as 4,6-dimethyl-2,4,6-tri-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-heptene, 4,6-dimethyl-2,4,6-tri-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-heptane, 1,3,5-tri-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-benzene, 1,1,1 -tri-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-ethane, tri-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-phenyl methane, 2,2-bis-[4,4-bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-cyclohexyl]-propane, 2,4-bis-(4-hydroxyphenylisopropyl)-phenol, tetra-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-methane, 2,6-bis-(2-hydroxy-5-methylbenzyl)-4-methyl phenol, 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-propane, tetra-(4-[4-hydroxyphenylisopropyl]-phenoxy)-methane, l,4-bis-[(4,4-dihydroxytriphenyl)methyl]-benzene. Phenolic branching agents may be introduced first with the resorcinol moieties while acid chloride branching agents may be introduced together with acid dichlorides.<br>
In one of its embodiments the invention comprises thermally stable resorcinol arylate polyesters made by the present method and substantially free of anhydride linkages linking at least two mers of the polyester chain. In a particular embodiment said<br>
polyesters comprise dicarboxylic acid residues derived from a mixture of iso- and terephthalic acids as illustrated in Formula VI:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R is at least one of C1-12 alkyl, C6-24 aryl, alkyl aryl or halogen, n is 0 to 3, and m is at least about 8. In various embodiments n is zero and m is between about 10 and about 300. The molar ratio of isophthalate to terephthalate is in one embodiment about 0.25 to 4.0:1, in another embodiment about 0.4 to 2.5:1, and in still another embodiment about 0.67 to 1.5:1. Substantially free of anhydride linkages means that said polyesters show decrease in molecular weight in one embodiment of less than 30% and in another embodiment of less than 10% upon heating said polymer at a temperature of about 280 to 290°C for five minutes.<br>
Also included in the scope of this invention are resorcinol arylate copolyesters containing soft-block segments as disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,916,997. The term soft-block as used herein, indicates that some segments of the polymers are made from non-aromatic monomer units. Such non-aromatic monomer units are generally aliphatic and are known to impart flexibility to the soft-block-containing polymers. The copolymers include those comprising structural units of Formulas I, VII, and VIII: <br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R and n are as previously defined, Z is a divalent aromatic radical, R2 is a C3-20 straight chain alkylene, C3-10 branched alkylene, or C4-10 cyclo- or bicycloalkylene group, and R3 and R4 each independently represent<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein Formula VIII contributes from about 1 to about 45 mole percent to the ester linkages of the polyester. Additional embodiments of the present invention provide a composition wherein Formula VIII contributes in various embodiments from about 5 to about 40 mole percent to the ester linkages of the polyester, and in other embodiments from about 5 to about 20 mole percent to the ester linkages of the polyester. Another embodiment provides a composition wherein R2 represents in one embodiment C3-14 straight chain alkylene, or C5-6 cycloalkylene, and in another embodiment R2 represents C3-10 straight-chain alkylene or C6-cycloalkylene. Formula VII represents an aromatic dicarboxylic acid residue. The divalent aromatic radical Z in Formula VII may be derived in various embodiments from at least one of the suitable dicarboxylic acid residues as defined hereinabove, and in some embodiments at least one of 1,3-phenylene, 1,4-phenylene, or 2,6-naphthylene. In various embodiments Z comprises at least about 40 mole percent 1,3-phenylene. In various embodiments of copolyesters containing soft-block chain members n in Formula I is zero.<br>
In various embodiments copolyesters containing resorcinol arylate chain members are those comprising from about 1 to about 45 mole % sebacate or cyclohexane-1,4-dicarboxylate units. In a particular embodiment a copolyester containing resorcinol arylate chain members is one comprising resorcinol isophthalate and resorcinol sebacate units in molar ratio between 8.5:1.5 and 9.5:0.5. In one embodiment said copolyester is prepared using sebacoyl chloride in combination with isophthaloyl dichloride.<br>
In another of its embodiments the present invention comprises block copolyestercarbonates comprising resorcinol arylate-containing block segments in combination with organic carbonate block segments. The segments comprising resorcinol arylate chain members in such copolymers are substantially free of anhydride linkages. Substantially free of anhydride linkages means that the copolyestercarbonates show decrease in molecular weight in one embodiment of less than 10% and in another embodiment of less than 5% upon heating said copolyestercarbonate at a temperature of about 280 to 290°C for five minutes. The block copolyestercarbonates include those comprising alternating arylate and organic carbonate blocks, typically as illustrated in Formula IX, wherein R and n are as previously defined, and R5 is at least one divalent organic radical:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The arylate blocks have a degree of polymerization (DP), represented by m, in one embodiment of at least about 4, in another embodiment of at least about 10, in another embodiment of at least about 20 and in still another embodiment of about 30 tol50. The DP of the organic carbonate blocks, represented by p, is in one embodiment, generally at least about 2, in another embodiment, at least about 10 to 20 and in still<br>
another embodiment about 2 to 200. The distribution of the blocks may be such as to provide a copolymer having any desired weight proportion of arylate blocks in relation to carbonate blocks. In general, the content of arylate blocks is in one embodiment about 10 to 95% by weight and in another embodiment about 50 to 95% by weight.<br>
Although a mixture of iso- and terephthalate is illustrated in Formula IX, the dicarboxylic acid residues in the arylate blocks may be derived from any suitable dicarboxylic acid residue, as defined hereinabove, or mixture of suitable dicarboxylic acid residues, including those derived from aliphatic diacid dichlorides (so-called "soft-block" segments). In various embodiments n is zero and the arylate blocks comprise dicarboxylic acid residues derived from a mixture of iso- and terephthalic acid residues, wherein the molar ratio of isophthalate to terephthalate is in one embodiment about 0.25 to 4.0:1, in another embodiment about 0.4 to 2.5:1, and in still another embodiment about 0.67 to 1.5:1.<br>
In the organic carbonate blocks, each R5 is independently a divalent organic radical. In various embodiments said radical comprises at least one dihydroxy-substituted aromatic hydrocarbon, and at least about 60 percent of the total number of R5 groups in the polymer are aromatic organic radicals and the balance thereof are aliphatic, alicyclic, or aromatic radicals. Suitable R5 radicals include m-phenylene, p-phenylene, 4,4'-biphenylene, 4,4'-bi(3,5-dimethyl)-phenylene, 2,2-bis(4-phenylene)propane, 6,6'-(3,3,3',3'-tetramethyl-l,r-spirobi[lH-indan]) and similar radicals such as those which correspond to the dihydroxy-substituted aromatic hydrocarbons disclosed by name or formula (generic or specific) in U.S. Patent 4,217,438.<br>
In some embodiments each R5 is an aromatic organic radical and in other embodiments a radical of Formula X:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
wherein each A1 and A2 is a monocyclic divalent aryl radical and Y is a bridging radical in which one or two carbon atoms separate A1 and A2. The free valence bonds in Formula X are usually in the meta or para positions of A1 and A2 in relation to Y. Compounds in which R5 has Formula X are bisphenols, and for the sake of brevity the term "bisphenol" is sometimes used herein to designate the dihydroxy-substituted aromatic hydrocarbons. It should be understood, however, that non-bisphenol compounds of this type may also be employed as appropriate.<br>
In Formula X, A1 and A2 typically represent unsubstituted phenylene or substituted derivatives thereof, illustrative substituents (one or more) being alkyl, alkenyl, and halogen (particularly bromine). In one embodiment unsubstituted phenylene radicals are preferred. Both A1 and A2 are often p-phenylene, although both may be o- or m-phenylene or one o- or m-phenylene and the other p-phenylene.<br><br>
The bridging radical, Y, is one in which one or two atoms, separate A1 from A2 . In a particular embodiment one atom separates A1 from A2. Illustrative radicals of this type are -O-, -S-, -SO- or -SO2-, methylene, cyclohexyl methylene, 2-[2.2.1]-bicycloheptyl methylene, ethylene, isopropylidene, neopentylidene, cyclohexylidene, cyclopentadecylidene, cyclododecylidene, adamantylidene, and like radicals.<br>
In some embodiments gem-alkylene (commonly known as "alkylidene") radicals are preferred. Also included, however, are unsaturated radicals. In some embodiments the preferred bisphenol is 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane (bisphenol-A or BPA), in which Y is isopropylidene and A1 and A2 are each p-phenylene. Depending upon the molar excess of resorcinol moiety present in the reaction mixture, R5 in the carbonate blocks may at least partially comprise resorcinol moiety. In other words, in some embodiments of the invention carbonate blocks of Formula X may comprise a resorcinol moiety in combination with at least one other dihydroxy-substituted aromatic hydrocarbon.<br>
Diblock, triblock, and multiblock copolyestercarbonates are encompassed in the present invention. The chemical linkages between blocks comprising resorcinol<br>
arylate chain members and blocks comprising organic carbonate chain members may comprise at least one of;<br>
(a) an ester linkage between a suitable dicarboxylic acid residue of an arylate moiety and an —O—R5~0— moiety of an organic carbonate moiety, for example as typically illustrated in Formula XI, wherein R5 is as previously defined :<br><br>

and (b) a carbonate linkage between a diphenol residue of a resorcinol arylate moiety and a —{C=O)—O— moiety of an organic carbonate moiety as shown in Formula XII, wherein R and n are as previously defined :<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The presence of a significant proportion of ester linkages of the type (a) may result in undesirable color formation in the copolyestercarbonates. Although the invention is not limited by theory, it is believed that color may arise, for example, when R5 in Formula XI is bisphenol A and the moiety of Formula XI undergoes Fries rearrangement during subsequent processing and/or light-exposure. In one embodiment the copolyestercarbonate is substantially comprised of a diblock copolymer with a carbonate linkage between resorcinol arylate block and an organic carbonate block. In another embodiment the copolyestercarbonate is substantially<br>
comprised of a triblock carbonate-ester-carbonate copolymer with carbonate linkages between the resorcinol arylate block and organic carbonate end-blocks.<br>
Copolyestercarbonates with at least one carbonate linkage between a thermally stable resorcinol arylate block and an organic carbonate block are typically prepared from resorcinol arylate-containing oligomers prepared by various embodiments of the invention and containing in one embodiment at least one and in another embodiment at least two hydroxy-terminal sites. Said oligomers typically have weight average molecular weight in one embodiment of about 10,000 to about 40,000, and in another embodiment of about 15,000 to about 30,000. Thermally stable copolyestercarbonates may be prepared by reacting said resorcinol arylate-containing oligomers with phosgene, at least one chain-stopper, and at least one dihydroxy-substituted aromatic hydrocarbon in the presence of a catalyst such as a tertiary amine.<br>
Examples of resorcinol ester containing polymers can be found in US Patents; 6,861,482, 6,559,270, 6,265,522, 6,294,647, 6,291,589 and 5,916,997.<br>
Alkyl amide compounds can be of any structure and any effective amount to reduce mold release pressure while maintaining transparency and having suitable melt processability. That is parts can be molded with no splay or other blemishes. Formulas XIII and XIV are examples of alkyl amides.<br>

wherein Ra or Ral are a C1 to C30 alkyl group and Rb, Rc and Rcl are independently H or a C1 to C30 alkyl group and Rd is a C2 to C6 alkyl group.<br>
The alkyl groups can be linear or branched; they may also be monocyclic, bicyclic or polycyclic. The alkyl groups may further contain one or more double bonds. Any mixture of the same or different alkyl groups can be present in the alkyl amide compound. Mixtures of two or more alkyl amides can also be employed. Examples of alkyl amides are the primary amides, the C1 to C6 N-alkyl amides and the, C1 to C6 secondary amides of; linear or branched C12-36 alkyl carboxylic acids. Alkyl amides can be made by reaction of ammonia, mono-amines, diamines or mixture thereof with carboxylic acids. Examples of carboxylic acids are; erucic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, arachidonic acid, behenic acid, lignoceric acid, tridecanoic acid, elaidic acid, and mixtures thereof. Alkyl amides can include the C6-20 bis amides of C2-6 alkylene diamines and mixtures containing any of the foregoing carboxylic acids.<br>
Some alkyl amides will have a molecular weight of from about 250 to about 1000. In other instances the alkyl amide will have a molecular weight of from 300 to 700. Molecular weight can be determined from the chemical structure of the alkyl amide. If the molecular weight is too low the alkyl amide may be lost from the resin mixture during melt processing by boiling or sublimation. If the alkyl amide molecular weight is too high the alkyl amide may separate from the resin mixture causing haze and/or loss of transparency.<br>

Essentially free of halogen atoms means that in some embodiments the composition has less than about 3% halogen by weight of the composition and in other embodiments less than about 1% halogen by weight of the composition. The amount of halogen atoms can be determined by ordinary chemical analysis.<br>
The compositions of the present invention can be blended with the aforementioned ingredients by a variety of methods involving intimate admixing of the materials with any additional additives desired in the formulation.

In some embodiments the melt processed composition exits processing equipment such as an extruder through small exit holes in a die, and the resulting strands of molten resin are cooled by passing the strands through a water bath. The cooled strands can be chopped into small pellets for packaging and further handling.<br>
The compositions of the invention can be formed into articles by any number of methods. Preferred methods include, for example, injection molding, compression molding, profile extrusion, sheet or film extrusion, gas assist molding, structural foam molding, machining and thermoforming.

131°C. PEI is ULTEM 1010 polyetherimide made by reaction of m-phenylene diamine and bisphenol A dianhydride, from GE Plastics. Aryl phosphite is tris (di-tert-butyl phenyl phosphite), IRGAPHOS 168, from Ciba Geigy Co. Aryl phosphonite is PEPQ from Clariant Co. Erucamide, or docosenic amide, was KENAMIDE- E from Crompton Co. Molecular weight is about 335. Ethylene bis stearamide, or EBS, was Kemamide W-40 from Crompton Co. Molecular weight is about 620. Pentaerythritol tetrastearate, or PETS, has a molecular weight of 1256.<br>
Examples A, 1-5 (Table 1) show blends of PEI with 40 % ITR 9010 along with examples containing erucamide and EBS alkyl amide compounds. The ITR 9010-PEI blends with added alkyl amide, examples 1 to 5, were all clear, showing a %T of over 65% and a % H below 5. In addition examples 1 to 5 show improvement in melt flow, at 337 °C, of from 10.2 to 45.6% compared to the blend with no alkyl amide (Example A). Even very low levels (0.1 to 0.3 wt.%) of alkyl amide are effective in improving flow. Also note the reduction in color, as measured by YI, in alkyl amide blends examples 1 to 4. <br>

In order to test mold release the examples of table 1 were injection molded on an 85 ton injection molding machine using a square four sided box mold. The box was 78 mm wide, 37 mm deep with a 3.2 mm wall thickness. The part was center gated. Molding was done using a cavity pressure of 35 Mpa, a melt temperature of 340 °C, a mold temperature of 120 °C and a 48 second cycle time. The force need to eject the box off the mold was measured for each resin (Table 2). The ejection force, measured in psi, was compared to the PEI-ITR9010 blend (example A) with no alkyl amide added. The percent reduction (improvement) in ejection force verses the example A was also calculated.<br><br>
