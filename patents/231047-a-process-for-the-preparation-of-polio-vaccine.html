				<td>The  present invention  relates to the  Sabin  strain  derived  inactivated<br><br>
Poliomyelitis Vaccine for immunization against Poliomyelitis.	<br><br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Polio is caused by three types of quite stable viruses belonging to the family of enteroviruses. There are different polio vaccines available in the market. These vaccines are trivalent containing a mixture of all the three types of poliovirus so as to confer immunity against all of them.<br><br><br>
One type of Polio Vaccine available is the Oral Polio Vaccine<br>
(OPV)  based  on  Sabin  strain.  This  orally  administered  Polio vaccine<br>
consists of live attenuated strains of polio virus.<br>
The OPV is commonly used because of its following advantages:<br>
1.	Manufacture of OPV does not pose any risk of accidental release<br>
of virulent polio viruses in the environment.<br>
2.	Worldwide  availability  of production  facilities  &amp;  easily  available<br>
Monovalent bulks.<br>
3.	Greater    herd    immunity    because    of    stimulation    of    mucosal<br>
immunity  and  the  resultant curtailment of spread  of wild  virus;<br>
displacement of wild virus in the community by	development<br>
of more than 30 vaccine-related  strains,  and	involuntary<br>
immunization of contacts by vaccine-related         virus.<br>
4.	Its administration is easier.<br>
However the OPV has the following disadvantages:<br>
1.	The OPV is highly perishable and requires cold chain maintenance<br>
below minus 20 deg. C.<br>
2.	Vaccine  derived   Polio  viruses  (Reversion   of attenuated  strains  to<br>
virulent strains).<br><br>
3.	Vaccine associated paralytic poliomyelitis.<br>
4.	Paralytic poliomyelitis in case of immuno-suppressed  recipients of<br>
OPV.<br>
Another Polio Vaccine available is Inactivated Polio Vaccine based on Salk strain (Salk IPV). The vaccine contains all the three types of polio virus, inactivated bylformalin.<br>
The advantage of Salk IPV is:<br>
It can be incorporated with other childhood immunizations like DPT.<br>
However the Salk IPV has the following disadvantages:<br>
1.	It poses a risk of accidental release of live virulent polio viruses<br>
in   the   environment  due   to   handling   of  virulent   strain   of   polio<br>
viruses during its production process.<br>
2.	Requires stringent standards like BL-3 laboratory for growing the<br>
Salk strain of poliovirus.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a Polio Vaccine derived from Sabin strains for immunization against Poliomyelitis which obviates the disadvantages, associated with known Polio vaccines OPV and Salk IPV.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a polio vaccine, which can be administered through injection.<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a Polio Vaccine derived from Sabin strain for immunization against Poliomyelitis prepared from Sabin seed strain or Sabin strain monovalent bulk suspensions used for blending of trivalent oral polio vaccine or by growing Sabin strain Polio viruses (from monovalent bulk used for trivalent OPV) in vero cell line or any suitable cell culture as per standard methods for the preparation of Oral Polio Vaccine characterized in that the Polio virus is first stabilized by adding a stabilizer, as herein described, and then inactivated by adding Formaldehyde (Formalin).<br>
The present invention also provides a process for the preparation of Polio Vaccine derived from Sabin strain for immunization against Poliomyelitis which comprises of preparing Polio Vaccine from Sabin seed strain or Sabin strain monovalent bulk suspensions used for blending of trivalent oral polio vaccine or by growing Sabin strain Polio viruses (from monovalent bulk used for trivalent OPV) in vero cell line or any suitable cell culture as per standard methods for the preparation of Oral Polio Vaccine characterized in that the Polio vaccine so prepared is first stabilized by adding a stabilizer, as herein described, and then inactivated by adding Formaldehyde (Formalin) according to a specific procedure as herein described.<br>
The Polio vaccine prepared from Sabin strain, as stated above, may be inactivated, according to present invention, by one of the following two processes.<br><br>
A)     Process -I :<br>
1)	Stabilization process:<br>
The monovalent bulk of poliovirus is to be initially stabilized by adding stabilizer like Sucrose or Trehalose or Arginine hydrochloride to retain the antigenicity of the vaccine during inactivation process.<br>
2)	Inactivation process I.<br>
i)        Inactivation process is to be initiated immediately.<br>
ii) Inactivation of each of filtered &amp; purified monovalent pool is to be carried out by adding formaldehyde (formalin) at 0.025% concentration and incubation at 37°C upto 48 hrs. &amp; then at 2°C to 8°C up to 12 days in a single cycle before further processing. Either of the treatment could be used for inactivation.<br>
iii) The test for free formaldehyde content is to be performed after every 12 hrs. during the inactivation process and the desired concentration level is maintained by intermittent readjustments.<br>
iv) A second filtration is to be done after the process of inactivation.<br>
v) Consistent inactivation of the virus is monitored and verified.<br>
B)	Process -II :<br>
1)     Stabilization process:<br><br>
The monovalent bulk vaccines are stabilized using the same procedure as described for Process-l.<br>
2)     Inactivation Process -II   :<br>
i) Inactivation is carried out by adding formaldehyde (formalin) at 0.025% concentration and incubation at 37°C for 4 hrs followed by chilling at 2°C to 8°C for 20 hrs. This incubation &amp; chilling cycle can be repeated up to 12 times so that total exposure at 37°C does not exceed 48 hrs during 12 days of incubation.<br>
ii) The test for free formaldehyde content is to be performed after every 12hrs during the inactivation process and the desired concentration level is maintained by intermittent readjustments.<br>
iii) A second filtration is to be done after the process of inactivation.<br>
iv) Consistent inactivation of the virus is monitored and verified.<br>
Maintenance of potency/ antigenic integrity of highly heat labile Sabin<br>
viruses:<br>
The  inactivation  processes  are  standardized  in  such  a way that live<br>
attenuated virus of each type is completely inactivated and the process<br>
ensures intact antigenic structure of Sabin strain. Inactivated vaccine is able<br>
to impart adequate immunity in vaccines when compared with standard<br>
vaccine.<br>
The  Sabin  strain  poliovirus,  in  present invention,  is  stabilized  before<br>
inactivation     using     stabilizer     like     sucrose,     trehalose,     arginine<br><br>
hydrochloride    to    avoid    degradation    of    nativeness    and    antigenic<br>
structure.<br>
The   inactivated   Polio   Vaccine,   prepared   according   to   the   present<br>
invention, in monovalent, bivalent or trivalent form has required amount<br>
of equivalent D - antigen or antigen form which could be compared with<br>
an established  reference standard of inactivated  polio vaccine and/or<br>
provide sero-conversion and required protection.<br>
The process for the preparation of Polio vaccine based on Sabin strain for immunization against Poliomyelitis, according to the present invention, is illustrated by the following Examples:<br>
Example 1:<br>
Seed strain of the same type and passage as used for poliomyelitis vaccine (oral); Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV), is propagated to produce monovalent suspension for inactivation.<br>
CELL CULTURE:<br>
i)        Different cell substrates for propagation of virus:<br>
1.	Human diploid cell line<br>
2.	Monkey kidney cells<br>
3.	Vero cell line<br>
4.	Any other suitable cell culture<br>
ii)       Large scale production of cells:<br>
1. Preparation of the Manufacturer's working cell bank (MWCB): MWCB in case of primary cell cultures (cells derived from normal tissue and stored frozen at minus 70°C) or from any other permitted continuous cell line are<br><br>
prepared   from   the   cells   &amp;   the   cells   pooled   after   serial subculture within the specified number of cell cultures. 2.       Any  of the following  systems  can  be  used,  which  ever is suitable, for stepwise increase in the volume of cells.<br>
•	Roller bottles -<br>
Growth in roller bottles differs from that in stationary cultures in distribution of cells on glass surface and maximum attainable cell density. Roller bottle cultures do not deteriorate rapidly as they can tolerate a density nearly two times higher than that of stationary cultures. Mammalian cells grown in monolayer culture will adapt best to roller bottle technique.<br>
•	Cell factories -<br>
These are stack of culture trays that share a common inlet and outlet port. These provide cells with a growing surface as large as inside of roller bottle, but take up less space inside incubator. These are ideal for adherent cell cultures, have low contamination risk and are compact.<br>
•	Roux flasks<br>
•	Micro-carrier system<br>
3. Samples for control cell cultures are incubated separately for at least two weeks and these are examined for evidence of cytopathic changes.<br>
PROPAGATION OF POLIO VIRUS IN CELL CULTURES: i)        Seed lot system:<br>
a)       Passage level as followed for Oral Polio Vaccine OR<br><br>
b) Its next passage level as derived from monovalent bulk suspension that could be used to manufacture oral polio vaccine.<br>
1.	The  vaccine   is   manufactured   on  the  basis   of  virus  seed   lot<br>
system. Virus seed lot is a quantity of virus processed together<br>
and of uniform composition prepared from seed lot.<br>
2.	Sub-culture of the seed virus should not be done more than 10<br>
times,  counted from a seed lot used for the production of the<br>
vaccine on which original laboratory and field tests were done.<br>
SINGLE HARVEST AND MONOVALENT POOLS:<br>
The virus is propagated in cell cultures and harvested from cell cultures derived from a single batch of cells and processed together. This is known as single harvest. The single harvests of one type of virus suspension are processed at the same time to get crude form of monovalent pool.<br>
FILTRATION OR CLARIFICATION OF MONOVALENT POOL: Crude virus suspension of each monovalent pool is purified stepwise through filters of decreasing porosity and finally through 0.22 µm filter. The purpose of filtration step is to remove particulate material and other substance that may affect inactivation process as such aggregates tend to increase on standing.<br>
CONCENTRATION OF THE MONOVALENT POOL:<br>
Each filtered monovalent pool is concentrated by Ultra-filtration.<br>
PURIFICATION OF THE MONOVALENT POOL:<br><br>
Chromatography with DEAE sepharose / immobilized DNA-ase column / immuno-adsorption column.<br>
The purification process should reduce consistently the level of cellular DNA from that of initial virus harvest by a factor of at least 108. The D-antigen concentration is to be determined by ELISA and display of comparable immunogenicity in rats. Accordingly, potency is to be adjusted. The monovalent pools of Poliovirus are to be blended to form the final trivalent bulk product.<br>
STABILISING THE SABIN VIRUS BEFORE INACTIVATION: The antigenicity of the vaccine is closely associated with the stability of the  native  virus  antigens  during   inactivation   process.   The   poliovirus antigenic structure is to be initially stabilized by adding stabilizer like sucrose or Trehalose or arginine hydrochloride.<br>
INACTIVATION USING FORMALDEHYDE:<br>
i) Inactivation process is initiated preferably within 24 hrs. and not later than 72 hrs after filtration.<br>
ii) Inactivation of each of filtered and purified monovalent pool is carried out by adding formaldehyde (formalin) at 0.025% and incubation at 37°C for specific time period as described earlier. The test for free formaldehyde is performed at intervals and the desired concentration level is maintained by intermittent readjustments.<br>
iii)      A second filtration is to be done after the process of inactivation.<br>
iv)      Consistent inactivation of the virus is monitored and verified.<br><br>
v)       Formaldehyde   is   neutralized   by   adding   sodium   bisulfite   and subsequently dialyzing it out.<br>
FORMULATION AND MANUFACTURING OF THE VACCINE: The inactivated monovalent viruses may be mixed with stabilizer or/and preservative to make monovalent, bivalent or trivalent inactivated vaccine. The final vaccine may be spray dried &amp; resuspended in ready-to-inject liquids like perfluorocarbons, requiring no refrigeration for storage or preparation before injection.<br>
TESTING THE EFFICACY OF THE VACCINE:<br>
The vaccine (as manufactured above) efficacy as compared with established reference vaccine is found to be equal in in-vitro and/or in-vivo method.<br>
Example 2 :<br>
The monovalent bulk suspensions obtained for the purpose of oral polio vaccine are inactivated using the same method as described in example 1 and then used for the purpose of manufacturing of Sabin based inactivated polio vaccine.<br>
The Polio Vaccine SIPV, prepared according to the present invention, has the following advantages:<br>
1.	The SIPV does not require growing of virulent strain of polio virus<br>
and   hence   its   production   process   does   not   involve   accidental<br>
release of live virulent polio viruses in the environment.<br>
2.	The  SIPV does  not have disadvantages  like  vaccine  associated<br>
paralytic poliomyelitis and vaccine derived virus.<br><br>
3.	The SIPV has the combined advantages of both OPV and Salk<br>
IPV.<br>
4.	The monovalent bulk is available easily.<br>
5.	Its production facilities are available worldwide.<br><br><br><br><br>
