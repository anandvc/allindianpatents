1.	Field  of  the  Invention<br>
This  invention  relates  to  a  slider  for  a  slide fastener,  and  more  particularly  to  a  slide  fastener  slider which  is  of  a  three-member  structure  comprising  a  slider body,  a  pull  tab  and  a  pull  tab  retaining  bar  and  hence  the slider  itself  can  be  assembled  in  a  simple  manner.<br>
2.	Prior  Art<br>
A  three-member  slider  for  a  slide  fastener  is  already known  which  comprises  a  slider  body,  a  pull  tab  and  a  pull<br><br>
upper  surface  front  and  rear  attachment  lugs  7',  7',  one opening  outwardly  and  upwardly  and  having  a  longitudinal groove  9'  and  the  other  having  an  outwardly  directed  hook engaging  portion  9',  and  in  which  the  pull  tab  retaining bar  2'   is  a  C-shape  resilient  bar  having  at  one  end  a  T-shape engaging  portion  2'-l   to  be  fitted  in  the  longitudinal  groove 9'  and  at  the  other  end  a  hook  2'-2  engageable  with  the  hook engaging  portion  9'.    For  assembly,  the  pull  tab  retaining bar  2'  is  slid  longitudinally  on  the  upper  surface  of  the slider  body  1'  to  insert  T-shape  engaging  portion  2'-l  into the  longitudinal  groove  9'  after  being  threaded  through  an<br><br>
opening  of  the  pull  tab,  and  then  the  hook  2'-2  is  pressed to  come  into  engagement  with  the  hook  engaging  portion  9', thus  connecting  the  pull  tab  to  the  slider  body  1'.<br>
Also,  as  shown  in  FIG.  16,  a  slider  is  known  (Japanese Utility  Model  Laid-Open  Publication  No.  60-'i213)  in  which the  upper  wing  40'  of  the  slider  body  10'  has  on  its  upper surface  C-shape  front  and  rear  attachment  lugs  70',  70' mutually  confronting  and  each  opening  upwardly,  while  the pull  tab  retaining  bar  20'  has  at  opposite  ends  a  pair  of legs  20'-1  each  having  a  pair  of  recesses  one  on  each  side. For  assembly,  the  legs  20'-1  of  the  pull   tab  retaining  bar 20'  is  fitted  in  the  respective  attachment  lugs  70',  and then  the  side  walls  of  each  attachment  lug  70'  are  clenched<br>
slider  body  10'.<br>
Further,  as  shown  in  FIG.  17,  a  synthetic  resin  slider is  known  (Japanese  Utility  Model   Laid-Open  Publication No.  60-70308)  in  which  the  upper  wing  of  the  slider  body  100' has  on  its  upper  surface  front  and  rear  attachment  lugs  700' each  having  a  longitudinal  through  hole,  and  a  pair  of grooves  each  communicating  with  the  lower  side  of  the respective  through  hole.    And  the  pull  tab  retaining  bar  200' has  at  opposite  ends  a  pair  of  legs  200'-1  each  having  an outwardly  directed  hook.    For  assembly,  the  pull  tab retaining  bar  200'  is  pressed  to  cause  the  legs  200'-1  to<br><br>
resiliently  deform  so  that  the  hooks  are  fitted  and  secured in  the  respective  through  holes  of  the  attachment  lugs  700', thus  attaching  the  pull  tab  300'   to  the  slider  body  100'.<br>
In  the  first-named  prior  art  of  FIG.   15,  the  T-shape engaging  portion  2'-l  formed  at  one  end  of  the  pull  tab retaining  bar  2'  made  of  synthetic  resin  is  fitted  in  the groove  of  one  attachment  lug  7',  and  the  hook  2*-2  formed  at the  other  end  of  the  pull  tab  retaining  bar  2'  is  resiliently deformed  to  come  into  engagement  with  the  hook  engaging portion  9"  of  the  other  attachment  lug  7'.    Since  the slider  is  molded  of  resilient  synthetic  resin  and  hence  is assembled  utilizing  resilient  deformation,  this  prior  art cannot  be  applied  to  a  slider  which  is  made  of  metal  and hence  is  unable  to  rpsiliently  deform.<br>
According  to  metallic  slider  of  the  second-named  prior art  of  FIG.   16,  since  the  legs  20'-l  at  opposite  ends  of  the pull  tab  retaining  bar  20'  cannot  be  fitted  in  the  attachment lugs  70'  easily  and  reliably,  in  the  automatic  assembling process  of  the  slider  which  requires  accuracy,  it  is impossible  to  improve  the  rate  of  production.<br>
In  the  third-named  prior  art  of  FIG.  17,   like  the first-named  prior  art,  since  the  slider  is  made  of  synthetic resin,  and  the  hooks  of  the  legs  200'-1  of  the  pull  tab retaining  bar  200'  is  resiliently  deformable  to  be  fitted in  the  through  holes  of  the  attachment  lugs  700'  during<br><br>
assembling,  this  prior  art  also  cannot  be  applied  to  a slider  made  of  metal.<br>

DETAILED  DESCRIPTION  OF  THE  PREFERRED  EMBODIMETNS Various  preferred  embodiments  of  a  slide  fastener slider  according  to  this  invention  will  now  be  described  in detal]  with  reference  to  the  accompanying  drawings.<br>
The  slide  fastener  slider  of  this  invention  is  obtained by  assembiling  a  slider  body  1,  20,  a  pull  tab  retaining  bar 2,  21  and  a  pull  tab  3,  22,  which  are  molded  of  metal  having a  low  melting  point  such  as  aluminum  alloy  or  zinc  alloy  by die  casting.<br>
In automatic assembly of the slider of FIGS. 1 through 11 which show a first embodiment of the invention, the pull tab retaining bar 2 is supplied to the slider body 1 placed on  a  t.urntable  of  an  automatic  assembling  machine  vertically<br><br>
is  plastically  deformed  so  as  to  attach  the  pull   tab  3  to the  slider  body  1.<br>
As  shown  in  FIGS,  1  and  2,  the  slider  body  1  is composed  of  upper  and  lower  wings U,  5  joined  together  by a  central  guide  post  6.    The  upper  wing  A  has  on  its  upper surface  front  and  rear  attachment  lugs  7,  7  to  which  the pull  tab  retaining  bar  2  is  to  be  attached.     Each  of  the attachment  lugs  7  has  an  insertion  hole  8  of  a  rectangular cross  section  extending  horizontally  from  the  outer  side and  longitudinally  of  the  slider  body  1,  and  a  guide  surface 9  contiguous  to  the  insertion  hole  8  at  the  inner  side.    An<br><br>
upper end portion of the guide surface 9 is defined to be an opening. Preferably, the guide surface 9 is arcuately curved.<br>
The  pull  tab  retaining  bar  2  has  a  length  so  as  to bridge  over  the  front  and  rear  attachment  lugs  7,  7,  and also  has  on  its  lower  surface  at  opposite  ends  a  pair  of legs  10  to  be  inserted  into  the  respective  insertion  holes 8  of  the  front  and  rear  attachment  lugs  7,  7.    Each  leg  10 is  tapered  to  an  end  and  has  on  the  outer  side  a  flat surface  11  touchable  with  the  upper  surface  of  the  attach¬ment  lug  7.    Thus  as  a  whole  the  pull  tab  retaining  bar  2 has  a   n  shape.    The  pull  tab  3  has  at  one  end  a  pintle  12 and  at  the  other  end  a  grip  13.<br><br>
lugs  7  are  arranged  on  the  upper  wing  4  of  the  slider  body  1. Alternatively,  in  a  doable-faced  slider,  another  pair  of attachment  lugs  may  be  arranged  on  the  lower  wing  5  for holding  another  pull  tab  retaining  bar  2  to  attach  another pull  tab  3  to  the  lower  wing  5.    Further,  this  invention may  be  applied  also  to  an  automatic  lock  slider  having  an automatic  locking  mechanism.<br>
For  assembly,  with  the  pintle  12  of  the  pull  tab  3 placed  on  the  upper  surface  of  the  upper  wing  A  of  the slider  body  1  which  is  placed  on  the  turntable  of  the automatic  assembling  machine,  between  the  front  and  rear<br><br>
attachment  lugs  7,  7,   the  pull  tab  retaining  bar  2  is supplied  to  the  slider  body  1  from  the  upper  side  until the  distal   ends  of  the  legs  10,   10  of  the  pull   tab  retaining bar  2  come  into  contact  with  the  respective  guide  surfaces 9,  9  of  the  front  and  rear  attachment  lugs  7,  7.    Then  the pull  tab  retaining  bar  2  is  pressed  to  insert  the  legs  10., 10  into  the  respective  insertion  holes  8,  8  along  the  guide surfaces  9,  9.    As  a  result,  the  pull  tab  retaining  bar  2 is  secured  to  the  slider  body  1  by  plastic  deformation, obtaining  a  completely  assembled  slider.<br>
FIGS.  3  through  5  shows  a  modified  attachment  lug  7 standing  on  the  slider  body  1.    The  modified  attachment lug  7  has  a  tongue  14  projecting  vertically  from  the  inner end  of  the  insertion  hole  8  at  the  upper  side  toward  the guide  surface  9.     Once  the  leg  10  of  the  pull  tab  retaining bar  2  is  forced  into  the  insertion  hole  8  of  the  attachment lug  7,  the  tongue  Vi  plastically  deforms  to  press  the  leg  10 to  cause  a  resisting  force  acting  against  removal  of  the  leg 10  from  the  insertion  hole  8.     In  an  alternative  way  for preventing  the  leg  10  from  being  removed  from  the  insertion hole  8,  the  tongue 14 may  have  a  serrated  surface  which  is touchable  with  the  upper  side  of  the  insertion  hole  8.<br>
FIGS. 6 and 7 show an improved form of the tongue 14 provided in the insertion hole 8 of the attachment lug 7. There  provided  a  space  between  an  inner  wall  surface  of  the<br><br>
insertion  hole  8  of  the  attachment  lug  7  and  the  leg  10. This  space  is  defined  in  order  to  have  a  wedge  shaped  claw 15  which  is  provided  at  a  corner  end  of  the  insertion  hole  8 and  facing  the  guide  surface  9  and  which  serves  to  prevent removal  of  the  leg  10.    When  the  leg  10  is  inserted  into  the insertion  hole  8  and  the  pull  tab  retaining  bar  2  is  pressed forcibly,  the  claw  15  engages  a  surface  of  the  claw  15  so as  to  bend  and  contact  tightly.<br>
Further,  FIGS.   7,  8  and  9  show  an  improvement  to  the contact  surfaces  of  an  upper  surface  of  the  attachment  lug  7 and  a  flat  surface  11  of  the  pull  tab  retaining  bar  2.    The attacliment  lug  7  has  on  its  upper  surface  a  projection  16. The  projection  16  of  FIGS. ^8  and  9  is  slightly  Inclined toward  the  outer  side.<br>
On  the  other  hand,  the  pull  tab  retaining  bar  2  has  in its  lower  flat  surface  11  at  a  position  near  the  base  of  the leg  10  a  recess  17  to  which  the  projection  16  is  to  be fitted  so  as  to  firmly  attach  the  pull  tab  retaining  bar  2 to  the  attachment  lugs  7.<br>
FTG.   10  shows  a  modified  pu11   tab  retaining  bar  2. The  modified  pull  tab  retaining  bar  2  has  a  pair  of  covering strips  18  extending  from  the  respective  ends.    The  covering strips  18  are  bent  when  the  pull  tab  retaining  bar  2  is attached  to  the  attachment  lugs  7  by  pressing,  for  covering outer  ends  of  the  insertion  holes  8  of  the  front  and  rear<br><br>
attachment,  lugs  7.    The  covering  strips  18  may  be  curved previously.<br>
FIG.   11  shows  a  modified  covering  strip  18  of  the pull  tab  retaining  bar  2.  The  modified  covering  strip  18 has  on  its  inner  surface  of  its  free  end  a  small  projection 19  which  is  to  be  fitted  in  the  outer  end  of  the  insertion hole  8,  serving  to  assist  in  preventing  the  pull  tab retaining  bar  2  from  being  removed  off  the  attachment  lugs  7.<br>
FIGS.   12  through  lA  show  a  second  embodiment  which  is somewhat  differenet  from  the  first  embodiment,  and  in  an automatic  assembling  process,  a  pull  tab  retaining  bar  21 is  supplied  horizontally  to  a  slider  body  20  which  is  placed on  the  turntable  of  the  automatic  assembling  machine  and  is<br><br>
In  this  slider,  like  the  slider  of  the  foregoing embodiment,  the  slider  body  20  is  composed  of  upper  and lower  wings  23,  24  joined  together  by  a  central  guide  post 37.    'The  attachment  lug  25  projects  from  the  upper  surface of  the  upper  wing  23  at  a  position  toward  a  front  end  or shoulder  38  of  the  slider  body  70  and  has  at  the  front  side a  horizontal  insertion  hole  26  of  a  rectangular  cross  section. A  rear  portion  of  the  insertion  hole  26  opens  and  the  same surface  extends  as  a  horizontal  guide  surface  27  contiguous to  the  insertion  hole  26.<br>
The  supporting  lug  28  projects  from  the  upper  surface<br><br>
of  the  upper  wing  23  at  a  position  toward  a  rear  end  opening 39.    The  supporting  lug  28  has  a  top  surface  29  having  the same  level   wit;h  both  the  insertion  hole  26  and  the  guide surface  27  of  the  attachment  lug  25  disposed  toward  the  front side  of  the  upper  wing  23.    Further,   the  supporting  lug  28 has  a  pair  of  side  recesses  30  one  on  each  side  so  as  to form  an  errlarged  head  31,  thus  assuming  a  T-shape  transverse cross  section  as  a  whole.    The  enlarged  head  31  has  a  width substantially  equal  to  that  of  the  insertion  hole  26.<br>
The  pull  tab  retaining  bar  21  has  a  generally  key-shape contour.     Specifically,  the  pull  tab  retaining  bar  21  has  at its front  stepped  end  33  a  horizontal   leg  32  of  a  rectangular cross  section  to  be  inserted  into  the  insertion  hole  26  so that  the  front  stepped  end  33  may  be  pldued  on  the  guide surface  27.     the  pull  tab  retaining  bar  21  further  has  at,, its  rear  end  a  socket  35  defined  by a  surrounding  wall  36 closing  at  three  sides  so  as  to  accommodate  and  to  be clenched  against  the  supporting  lug  28.    The  lower  surface of  the  front  stepped  end  33  and  the  lower  surface  of  the front  leg  32  as  well   as  other  contact  surfaces  touchable with  the  top  surface  29  of  the  supporting  lug  28  are  in  a common  level.    A  pull  Lab  22  has  at  one  end  a  pintle  3A.<br>
The  attachment,  lug  25  and  the  supporting  lug  28  may  be arranged  not  only  on  the  upper  wing  23  of the  slider  body  20 but  on  the  lower  wing 24,  and  the  pull  tab  retaining  bars  21<br><br>
may  be  attached  respectively  so  as  to  form  a  double-sided slidcr.<br>
For  assembling  the  slider,  with  the  pintle  34  oC  the pull  tab  22  placed  on  the  upper  wing  23  of  the  slider  body 20  between  the  attachment  lug  25  and  the  supporting  lug  28, the  pull  tab  retaining  bar  21  is  supplied  horizontally,  i.e. from  the  side  toward  the  supporting  lug  28  to  the  slider body  20  placed  on  the  turntable  of  the  automatic  assembling machine,  so  that  the  front  leg  32  of  the  front  stepped  end 33  of  the  pull  tab  retaining  bar  21  is  inserted  into  the insertion  hole  26  as  it  slides  along  the  guide  surface  27 of  the  attachment  lug  25,  while  the  supporting  lug  28  is received  in  the  socket  35.    Then  the  surrounding  wall  36  of<br><br>
the  supporting  lug  28  from  opposite  sides  to  secure  the  pull Lab  retaining  bar  21,attaching  the  pull  tab  22  to  the slider  body  20.    As  a  result,  a  completely  assembled  slider is  obtained.<br>
With  the  slider  of  this  invention,  the  following advantageous  results  can  he  realized.<br>
Since  the  slider  is  made  of  metal  and  composed  of three  members  of  the  slider  body  1,   the  pull  tab  3,  and  the pull  tab  retaining  bar  2,  with  the  front  and  rear  attachment lugs  7  each  having  the  insertion  hole  8  and  the  guide  sur¬face  9  contiguous  to  the  insortion hole  8  stand  from  the<br><br>
upper  surface  of  the  slider  body  1,  and  since  t.he  pull  tab retaining  bar  2  has  the  pair  of  legs  10  to  be  inserted  into the  respective   insertion  holes  8  of  the  front  and  rear attachment  lugs  7  with  the  pintle  12  being  placed  on  the slider  body  1,  the  slider  is  most  suitable  for  automatic assembling  process,  and  the  slider  can  be  manufactured easily  at  a  high  speed,  thus  improving  the  rate  of production.<br>
In  attaching  the  pull  tab  retaining  bar  2  to  the attachment  lugs  7,  since  the  legs  10  of  the  pull  tab retaining  bar  2  are  inserted  into  the  insertion  holes  8  as they  arc  bent  along  the  guide  surfaces  9  by  plastic  deforma¬tion,  it  is  possible  to  attach  the  pull  tab  retaining  bar  2<br><br>
compared  to  the  conventional  art.    This  slider  is  therefore most  suitable  to  be  automatically  assembled.     The  assembled slider  is  free  from  any  damage  due  to  the  process  and  is hence  neat  in  appearance  as  well  as  is  unyielding.<br>
And since the attachment lug 7 having the Insertion hole a is provided to project from each of the upper and lower wings 4, 5 and the pull tab retaining bar 2 is attached to each of the attachment lugs 7 so as to form the double-sided slider, the sturdy double-sided slider of a simple structure composed of three members of the slider body  1,  the  pull  tab  3,  and  the  pull  tab  retaining  bar  2  can<br><br>
be  assembled  accurately  and  automatically.<br>
Due  to  the  form  of  the  attachment  Jug  7  and  the  pull tab  retaining  bar  2,  it  is  possible  to  plastic-deform  the pull  tab  retaining  bar  2  only  by  pressing  the  pull  tab retaining  bar  2  vertically  toward  the  slider  body  1.    Thus the  pull  tab  retaining  bar  2  can  be  attached  to  the  attach¬ment  lugs  7  easily  and  the  slider  is  most  suitable  for  the turntable-type  automatic  assembling  machine.<br>
Further,  since  the  pull  tab  retaining  bar  2  can  be molded  on  a  horizontally  split  die,  a  slider  neat  in  appear¬ance  as  free  from  any  parting  line  on  the  surface  of  the pull  tab  retaining  bar  2  unlike  the  conventional  slider  can be  obtained.<br>
Partly  since  the  guide  surfaces  9  of  the  attachment lugs  7  are  arcuately  curved  and  partly  since  each of  the legs  10  of   the  pull  tab  retaining  bar  2  is  tapered  off, plastic  deformation  of  the  legs  10  can  take  place  easily, so  that  the  pull  tab  retaining  bar  2  can  be  attached  smoothly.<br>
With  the  tongue  lA  projecting  from  the  inner  and  upper end  of  the  insertion  hole  8  toward  the  guide  surface  9,  it is  possible  to  contact  the  leg  10  tightly  with  the  insertion hole  8,  so  that  the  slider  body  1  and  the  pull  tab  retaining bar  2  can  be  attached  to  each  other  stably.<br>
Since  the  space  is  defined  between  the  inner  side  wall of  the  insertion  hole  8  and  the  leg  10,  and  since  the  wedge<br><br>
shaped  claw  15  for  preventing  removal  of  the  leg  10  is provided  confronting  the  guide  surface  9  at  the  corner  end of  the  insertion  hole  8,  the  claw  15  presses  one  surface  of the  leg  10  when  the  pull  tab  retaining  bar  2  is  pressed, thus  the  claw  15  bites  the  leg  10  and  bend  to  contact  tightly with  the  leg  10,  preventing  removal  of  the  pull  tab  retaining bar  2.    Further,  due  to  the  presence  of  the  space  and  the claw  15,  plastic  deformation  takes  place  locally  at  the  end portion  of  the  leg  10  and  proceeds  gradually  so  that  the  base of  the  leg  10  does  not  get  damaged.<br>
Partly  since  the  attachment  lug  has  on  its  upper surface  the  projection  16,  and  partly  since  the  pull  tab retaining  bar  2  has  in  its  lower  flat  surface  at  the  position near  the  base  of  the  leg  10  the  recess  17   to  which  the  pro¬jection  16 is  to  be  fitted,  it  is  possible  to  attach  the  pull tab  retaining  bar  2  to  the  attachment  lugs  7  with  increased f i rmness.<br>
As  the  pull  tab  retaining  bar  2  has  the  pair  of  covering strips  18  extending  from  the  respective  ends,  for  covering outer  ends  of  the  insertion  holes  8  of  thp  front  and  rear attachment  lugs  7,  it is  possible  to  make  the  overall appearance  of  the  slider  much  more  sightly.<br>
In  the  slider  of  the  second  embodiment  of  the  invention, with  the  structure  as  described  above,  it  is  possible  to supply  the  pull  tab  retaining  bar  21  horizontally  to  the<br><br>
slider  body  20  accurately  and  smoothly  and  also  to  clench the  surrounding  wall  36  of  the  socket  35  against  the supporting  lug  28  from  opposite  sides.    Therefore  the  slider can  be  assembled  using  a  reduced-height  assembling  mechanism. This  slider  is  particularly  suitable  to  be  manufactured  by a  small-size  machine  and  can  be  assembled  with  ease,  having adequate  sturdiness.<br>
Since  the  supporting  lug  28  on  the  slider  body  20  is in  a  T-shape,  and  since  the  socket  35  of  the  pull  tab retaining  bar  21  is  consisted  of  the  surrounding  wall  36 with  one  side  being  open,  the  pull  tab  retaining  bars  21 can  be  supplied  horizontally  sliding  on  the  supporting  lug 28  and  the  clenching  process  can  be  performed  easily,  thus<br>
And  partly  since  the  insertion  hole  26  and  the  guide surface  27  horizontally  defined  in  the  attachment  lug  25 have  Lho  same  level  as  the  top  surface  29  of  the  supporting lug  28,  and  partly  since  the  contact  surface  of  the  pull tab  retaining  bar  21  is  one,  the  pull  tab  retaining  bar  21 can  be  fed  accurately  and  smoothly  and  can  be  attached stably.•<br><br><br>
