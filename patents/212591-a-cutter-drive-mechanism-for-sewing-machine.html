				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a cutter drive mechanism for sewing<br>
machine, and more particularly to a cutter drive mechanism for sewing machine<br>
which can perform lock stitching and over-edge stitching integrally and further<br>
can perform such stitchings by changing over an operation which performs the<br>
over-edge stitching in the lock stitching by cutting a fabric edge and an operation<br>
which performs the lock stitching without cutting the fabric edge. This<br>
specification discloses a looper drive mechanism of a sewing machine.<br>
The present invention has been divided out of the Indian patent<br>
application No. IN/PCT/2001/01210.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Conventionally, as the most fundamental stitch formed by a sewing<br>
machine among stitches formed by joining a plurality of fabrics or the like, a lock<br>
stitching is known. In the lock stitching, when an upper thread which is made to<br>
pass through a needle is made to penetrate the fabric along with the vertical<br>
movement of the needle, by intercepting the upper thread with a loop-taker point<br>
of a rotary hook which accommodates a lower thread so that the upper thread<br>
and the lower thread are crossed with each other to form the lock stitching<br>
whereby a plurality of fabrics are securely joined along the stitch.<br>
On the other hand, as the stitching which can prevent unraveling of<br>
peripheral portions of the fabrics or the like which are liable to be disintegrated,<br>
an over-edge stitching is known. In the over-edge stitching, depending on the<br>
number of threads for forming the stitch and the number of needles which<br>
perform an approximately vertical movement relative to a fabric surface, there<br>
have been known a single-needle two-thread over-edge stitching (U.S.A. Stitch<br>
standard: Stitch type 503), a single-needle three-thread over-edge stitching<br>
(U. S .A. Stitch standard: Stitch type 504), and further a two-needle five-thread<br>
stitching (U. S .A. Stitch standard: Stitch type 516) which combines a chain<br>
stitching and the over-edge stitching and is usually called an interlock.<br>
However, in such an over-edge stitching, to form stitches, a thread is<br>
intercepted from side by two hook-shaped needles called loopers or looper<br>
threads which move horizontally are intercepted by needles. In this manner,<br>
since the looper threads do not cross in the direction perpendicular to the fabric<br>
surface with respect to the needle thread, it is impossible to securely join the<br>
fabrics as in the case of the lockstitching. That is, there arises a so-called<br>
"laughing" phenomenon in which when two fabrics joined by the over-edge<br>
stitching are opened, the stitching threads are exposed outside. Accordingly, in<br>
performing the over-edging after joining a plurality of fabrics, it is necessary to<br>
form the stitch (U. S .A. Stitch standard: Stitch type 517) by performing the<br>
lockstitch.<br>
In such a stitch (U.S.A. Stitch standard: Stitch type "517), although it is<br>
desirable that the lockstitch portion and the over-edge portion are disposed as<br>
close as possible to each other, the lockstitch requires a rotary hook to<br>
accommodate a lower thread below the needle which performs the vertical<br>
movement, while the over-edge stitching requires loopers which move to cross a<br>
locus of the vertical movement of a needle which is provided separately from the<br>
needle of the lockstitching and hence, there naturally exists a limit with respect to<br>
the respective positions of the lockstitch portion and, the over-edge stitching<br>
portion. In view of the above, sewing machines which can be used for both of<br>
the lockstitching and the over-edge stitching have been proposed in Japanese<br>
Patent Publication 15268/1981, Japanese Patent Publication 25145/1985,<br>
Japanese Patent Publication 25396/1986 and the like. However, all of the<br>
sewing machines disclosed in these publications are sewing machines which<br>
selectively use one of these functions and it has been impossible to perform the<br>
lockstitching and the over-edge stitching simultaneously in a state that the<br>
lockstitching and the over-edge stitching are disposed close to each other.<br>
On the other hand, methods in which the lockstitching and the over-edge<br>
stitching can be performed simultaneously have been proposed as disclosed in<br>
Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication 113490/1980, Japanese Laid-open<br>
Patent Publication 136085/1980, Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication<br>
146190/1980, Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication 122495/1988and the like.<br>
However in these proposals, with respect to the over-edge stitching, since the<br>
loopers which cross the locus of the vertical movement of a needle and are<br>
provided separately from the lockstitching adopt the looper movement of the<br>
above-mentioned conventional over-edge stitching as their movement, the<br>
lockstitching requires a rotary hook to accommodate the lower thread below the<br>
needle which performs the vertical movement and the over-edge stitching<br>
requires the loopers which performs their movement such that the movement<br>
crosses the locus of the vertical movement of the needle provided separately<br>
from the lockstitching. Accordingly, there naturally exits a limit with respect to the<br>
positions of the over-edge stitching and the lockstitching and it has been difficult<br>
to perform the lockstitching and the over-edge stitching simultaneously in a state<br>
that the lockstitching and the over-edge stitching are disposed close to each<br>
other in terms of the mechanism of the sewing machine.<br>
Further, a lockstitching/over-edge stitching attachment (manufactured by<br>
TOYO SEIKI KOGYO KABUSHIKIGAISHA, product name "RUBYLOCK") which<br>
simultaneously performs the lockstitching and the over-edge stitching has been<br>
proposed (Japanese Patent Publication 2541601). This attachment is adapted<br>
to be fixedly mounted on a fabric presser rod. A drive arm of a crank journalled in<br>
an attachment frame is driveri by a needle rod which carries a needle. A driven<br>
arm rocks an upper looper drive plate supported on the attachment frame by way<br>
of a drive connection link. Due to the rocking of this upper looper drive plate, an<br>
upper looper supported on the attachment frame by way of an upper looper drive<br>
link is rocked.<br>
On the other hand, due to this rocking of the upper looper drive plate, a<br>
pin mounted on the upper looper drive plate in a protruding manner slides in and<br>
along a groove formed in a lower looper drive plate journalled in the attachment<br>
frame and rocks this lower looper drive plate. Due to this rocking of the lower<br>
looper drive plate, a lower looper journalled in the attachment frame is rocked by<br>
way of a lower looper drive link. In such an attachment structure, since the<br>
upper looper must intersect the needle on the upper surface of a fabric, the<br>
upper looper is inclined in a left upward direction as seen from the fabric feeding<br>
and advancing direction. Further, since the lower looper must intersect the<br>
needle on the lower surface of the fabric, the lower looper is inclined in the left<br>
downward direction as seen from the fabric feeding and advancing direction.<br>
Further, the upper and lower loopers, are inclined such that the upper and lower<br>
loopers interloop each other at a side of the fabric end of the fabric.<br>
In the attachment having such a constitution, when the needle bar<br>
performs the upward and downward movement, the lockstitching is formed by<br>
the needle thread which passes through the needle and the lower thread<br>
accommodated in a rotary hook. Simultaneously, the drive arm of the crank is<br>
driven by the needle bar and the driven arm rocks the upper looper drive plate by<br>
way of the drive connection link. Due to this rocking of the upper looper drive<br>
plate, the upper looper is rocked by way of the upper looper drive link.<br>
Due to this rocking of the upper looper drive plate, the pin which is<br>
mounted on the upper looper drive plate in a protruding manner slides in<br>
and along the groove formed in the lower looper drive plate so as to rock the<br>
lower looper drive plate. Due to this rocking of the lower looper drive plate, the<br>
lower looper is rocked by way of the lower looper drive link so that the over-edge<br>
stitching is formed by the upper and lower looper threads which respectively<br>
pass through the upper and lower loopers.<br>
However, in such an attachment, since the upper and lower loopers are<br>
inclined, a high machining technique is required in manufacturing and a<br>
technique which maintains accuracy in assembling is also required. Further,<br>
since this type of lockstitch sewing machine is used by a general household or a<br>
tailor as a user, an operation to exchange a fabric presser to the fabric presser<br>
bar becomes extremely cumbersome and an operation to adjust the positional<br>
relationship of the upper and lower loopers relative to the needle after<br>
fixedly securing the attachment becomes also extremely cumbersome. This<br>
attachment also suffers from a serious drawback that the over-edge stitching<br>
operation must be performed after preliminarily cutting the edge of the fabric to<br>
be stitched by the over-edge stitching using scissors.<br>
Accordingly, inventors of the present application have proposed a<br>
single-needle four-thread lockstitch/over-edge stitch structure and a method<br>
for forming such stitching which have both of the lockstitching function<br>
and the over-edge stitching function and can form such a stitch<br>
structure at a time using a sewing machine (Japanese Patent Publication<br>
2672097). Users of the lockstitch sewing machines have been strongly desiring<br>
the research and the development of a lockstitch sewing machine which can<br>
realize the single-needle four-thread lockstitch/over-edge stitch structure and a<br>
method for forming such a stitch structure disclosed in the above proposal.<br>
Further, all of the single-needle two-thread over-edge stitching (U.S.A.<br>
Stitch standard: Stitch type 503), the single-needle three-thread over-edge<br>
stitching (U.S.A. Stitch standard: Stitch type 504), the two-needle five-thread<br>
over-edge stitching (U.S.A. Stitch standard: Stitch type 516) and the like<br>
employed for forming stitches of over-edge stitching perform an over-edge<br>
stitching by cutting a fabric edge with cutters consisting of an upper cutter which<br>
performs the upward and downward movement and a lower cutter which is<br>
cooperatively operated with the upper cutter.<br>
Here, it is considered that the over-edge stitching can be performed easily<br>
even in the lockstiching if a zigzag stitching is performed after cutting the fabric<br>
edge in a zigzag pattern. Based on such a consideration, a sewing machine<br>
which adds a cutter cutting function to the lockstitching has been proposed in<br>
Japanese Utility Model Laid-open Application 90056/1982, 90057/1982,<br>
Japanese Patent Publication31950/1983 and the like.<br>
Here, in general, in addition to a request that the lockstitch sewing<br>
machine must be manufactured in a compact form, it is desirable that the<br>
lockstitch portion and the cutter cutting mechanism portion are disposed as close<br>
as possible to each other. However, since the lockstitching requires a rotary<br>
hook which accommodates a lower thread below a needle which performs the<br>
upward and downward movement, there naturally exists a limit in incorporating<br>
the cutter cutting mechanism portion into an existing structural space of the<br>
lockstitch sewing machine. In this manner, it has been conventionally difficult to<br>
physically realize a lockstitch sewing machine which can perform the<br>
lockstitching and the fabric-edge cutting simultaneously and to commertialize<br>
such a lockstitch sewing machine due to the mechanism of the sewing machine.<br>
The present invention has been made to overcome these conventional<br>
drawbacks and it is an object of the present invention to provide a looper drive<br>
mechanism of a sewing machine which has both of lockstitching function and<br>
over-edge stitching function and can perform them at a time using a single<br>
sewing machine.<br>
Further, It is another object of the present invention to provide a cutter<br>
drive mechanism of a sewing machine which can incorporate a cutter cutting<br>
mechanism portion into an existing structural space of the sewing machine and<br>
can change over an operation to perform the over-edge stitching in the<br>
lockstitching by cutting a fabric edge and an operation to perform the<br>
lockstitching without cutting the fabric edge.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Indian patent application No. IN/PCT/2001/01210 provides a looper drive<br>
mechanism for sewing machine in which using an upper thread which is made to<br>
pass through a needle which performs an upward and downward movement<br>
drawing a trace vertically relative to a throat plate and a lower thread<br>
accommodated in a rotary hook, the upper thread which is made to pass through<br>
the needle performing the reciprocating movement in the vertical direction and<br>
passing through a work mounted on the throat plate everyone stitch feed of the<br>
work is, at the time of elevating the upper thread from a lowermost position of the<br>
needle, intercepted by a loop-taker point of said rotary hook which<br>
accommodates the lower thread below said throat plate and performs the<br>
rotational movement so as to make the upper thread and the lower thread<br>
interlace with each other thus forming a lockstitch portion made of a stitch<br>
parallel to a surface of the work and a stitch perpendicular to the surface of the<br>
work, and an over-edge stitch portion is formed by an upper looper thread and a<br>
lower looper thread which are respectively made to pass through an upper<br>
looper which performs a reciprocating movement drawing an arcuate trace<br>
extending above and below said throat plate_and intersects the trace of the<br>
needle above the throat plate and a lower looper which draws an arcuate trace<br>
below said throat plate and intersects the trace of the needle and the trace of<br>
said upper looper respectively, characterized by a looper drive portion having a<br>
constitution in which <br>
said upper looper and said lower looper are respectively disposed below<br>
said throat plate,<br>
respective loop-taker points thereof are arranged in the same direction<br>
such that the loop-taker points pass a front side of said needle as seen in the<br>
stitching direction,<br>
said upper looper and said lower looper are driven such that the upper<br>
looper and the lower looper perform movements having traces on planes parallel<br>
to each other,<br>
the upper looper thread which is made to pass through said upper looper<br>
which performs the reciprocating movement drawing the arcuate trace which<br>
intersects the trace of the needle above said throat plate and passes through<br>
said throat plate is intercepted by the needle descending from an uppermost<br>
position when said upper looper is descended from an uppermost position,<br>
the lower looper thread which is made to pass through said lower looper which<br>
performs the reciprocating movement drawing the trace which intersects the trace of the<br>
needle and the trace of said upper looper below said throat plate is intercepted by the<br>
descending needle below the throat plate when the lower looper is moved from one end to<br>
the other end of the trace, and<br>
the lower looper thread is intercepted by the upper looper elevating from the<br>
lowermost position when said lower looper is moved to the other end, whereby<br>
the upper looper thread and the lower looper thread are interlooped with each other<br>
at the edge portion of the work and, at the same time, the upper looper thread is<br>
interlooped with the lockstitch portion through the upper surface of the work, and the lower<br>
looper thread is interlooped with the lockstitch portion through the lower surface of the work<br>
thus forming the over-edge stitch portion.<br>
The present invention provides a cutter drive mechanism for a sewing machine for<br>
cutting a fabric edge by an upper cutter which performs upward and downward movement<br>
by means of a motion transfer mechanism which is operated in an interlocking manner with<br>
a rotary shaft of the sewing machine and a lower cutter which is cooperatively operated<br>
with the upper cutter, characterized in that<br>
the cutter drive mechanism of the sewing machine comprises a cutter drive portion<br>
pivotally mounted on a frame and slidably guides the upper cutter;<br>
said motion transfer meghanism is connected to said upper cutter such that by<br>
means of a clutch which allows the transmission of power to the upper cutter when the<br>
cutter operation of the cutter drive portion is performed and interrupts the transmission of<br>
power to the upper cutter by pivotally moving the cutter drive portion to a shunting position<br>
when the cutter operation of the cutter drive portion is not performed ; and<br>
said lower cutter is slidably mounted on the cutter drive portion and said lower cutter<br>
has a locating locking-portion which positions the cutter drive portion at a locating<br>
recessed-portion of a throat plate relative to a needle stitching point when the cutter is<br>
operated.<br>
The motion transfer mechanism may include a first quadric crank chain which<br>
connects an upper shaft constituting the rotary shaft and the frame and a second quadric<br>
crank chain which uses one link of the first quadric crank chain and a link joint of the frame<br>
and adopts a drive portion of the clutch as the other one link.<br>
The clutch preferably includes a pin which is formed on the other one link as a drive<br>
portion, and an elongated groove being formed in the upper cutter for allowing the pin to be<br>
fitted thereinto as a driven portion.<br>
The locating recessed-position of the throat plate is preferably constituted position-<br>
adjustably in the rightward and leftward directions such that the stitch width can be<br>
changed relative to the needle stitching position.<br>
In one embodiment, the lower cutter is slidably mounted on the cutter drive portion<br>
and the cutter drive mechanism further comprises a cutter-side pressure spring member<br>
which biases the upper cutter to the lower cutter.<br>
In another embodiment, the lower cutter is slidably mounted on the cutter<br>
drive portion and the cutter drive mechanism further comprises a locating spring<br>
member which biases the locating locking-portion to the locating recessed-<br>
portion of the throat plate at the time of performing the cutting operation.<br>
In a yet another embodiment, the lower cutter is slidably mounted on the<br>
cutter drive portion and the cutter drive mechanism further comprises a locating<br>
eccentric cam which fits the locating locking-portion into the locating recessed-<br>
portion of the throat plate at the time of performing the cutting operation.<br>
The upper cutter is preferably replaceably mounted on the cutter drive<br>
portion.<br>
In the cutting drive mechanism having such a constitution, the rotational<br>
movement of the rotary shaft of the sewing machine is transferred to the upward<br>
and downward movement by way of the motion transfer mechanism which is<br>
operated in an interlocking manner with the rotary shaft and the fabric edge is cut<br>
by the upper cutter and the lower cutter which cooperates with th the upper<br>
cutter due to this upward and downward movement. Here, the upper cutter is<br>
slidably guided by the cutter drive portion pivotably supported on the frame. The<br>
motion transfer mechanism is connected to the upper cutter by way of the clutch.<br>
The clutch transmits power to the upper cutter when the cutter operation of the<br>
cutter drive portion is performed and interrupts the transmission of the power to<br>
the upper cutter by pivotably moving the cutter drive portion to the shunting<br>
position when the cutter operation of the cutter drive portion is not performed.<br>
Further, the lower cutter of the cutter drive mechanism of the sewing<br>
machine of the present invention is slidably mounted on the cutter drive portion<br>
and includes a locating locking-portion which locates the cutter drive portion at<br>
the locating recessed-portion of the throat plate relative to the needle stitching<br>
position at the time of operating the cutters, and the cutter drive portion includes<br>
a locating lever which fits the locating locking-portion into the locating recessed-<br>
portion of the throat plate at the time of performing the cutter operation.<br>
In the cutting drive mechanism of the sewing machine having such a<br>
constitution, the rotational movement of the rotary shaft of the sewing machine is<br>
transferred to the upward and downward movement by way of the motion<br>
transfer mechanism which is operated in an interlocking manner with the rotary<br>
shaft and the fabric edge is cut by the upper cutter and the lower cutter which<br>
cooperates with the upper cutter due to this upward and downward movement.<br>
Here, the upper cutter is slidably guided by the cutter drive portion pivotally<br>
supported on the frame. The motion transfer mechanism is connected to the<br>
upper cutter by way of the clutch.<br>
The clutch transmits power to the upper cutter when the cutter operation<br>
of the cutter drive portion is performed and interrupts the transmission of the<br>
power to the upper cutter by pivotally moving the cutter drive portion to the<br>
shunting position when the cutter operation of the cutter drive portion is not<br>
performed. Here, with the use of the locating lever of the cutter drive portion,<br>
after the locating locking-portion of the lower cutter is removed from the locating<br>
recessed-portion of the throat plate, the cutter drive mechanism can be directly<br>
pivotally moved to the shunting position.<br>

Description of Prior Art<br>
As shown in Fig. 27, a conventional attachment is used in a form that it is<br>
fixedly mounted on a fabric presser rod 1001. A drive arm 1003a of a crank 1(503<br>
journalled in an attachment frame 1002 is driven by a needle rod (not shown in<br>
the drawing) which carries a needle 1011. A driven arm 1003b rocks an upper<br>
looper drive plate 1005 supported on the attachment frame 1002 by way of a<br>
drive connection link 1004. Due to the rocking of this upper looper drive plate<br>
1005, an upper looper 1007 supported on the attachment frame 1002 by way of<br>
an upper looper drive link 1006 is rocked. On the other hand, due to this rocking<br>
of the upper looper drive plate 1005, a pin 1005a mounted on the upper looper<br>
drive plate 1005 in a protruding manner slides in and along a groove 1008a<br>
formed in a lower looper drive plate 1008 journalled in the attachment frame<br>
1002 and rocks this lower looper drive plate 1008. Due to this rocking of the<br>
lower looper drive plate 1008, a lower looper 1010 journalled in the attachment<br>
frame 1002 is rocked by way of a lower looper drive link 1009. In such an<br>
attachment structure, since the upper looper 1007 must intersect the needle<br>
1011 on the upper surface of a fabric (not shown in the drawing), the upper<br>
looper 1007 is inclined in a left upward direction as seen from the fabric feeding<br>
and advancing direction. Further, since the lower looper 1010 must intersect the<br>
needle 1011 on the lower surface of the fabric, the lower looper 1010 is inclined<br>
in the left downward direction as seen from the fabric feeding and advancing<br>
direction. Further, the upper and lower loopers 1007, 1010 are inclined such that<br>
the upper and lower loopers 1007, 1010 interloop each other at a side of the<br>
fabric end of the fabric.<br>
In the drawing, numeral 1014 indicates a needle stitching portion of the<br>
needle 1011, numeral 1012 indicates a thread tension equipment and numeral<br>
1013 indicates a looper thread take-up driven by the lower looper drive plate<br>
1008.<br>
In the attachment having such a constitution, when the needle bar<br>
performs the upward and downward movement, the lockstitching is formed by<br>
the needle thread (not shown in the drawing) which passes through the needle<br>
1011 and the lower thread (not shown in the drawing) accommodated in a rotary<br>
hook (not shown in the drawing). Simultaneously, the drive arm 1003a of the<br>
crank 1003 is driven by the needle bar and the driven arm 1003b rocks the upper<br>
looper drive plate 1005 by way of the drive connection link 1004. Due to this<br>
rocking of the upper looper drive plate 1005, the upper looper 1007 is<br>
rocked by way of the upper looper drive link 1006. Due to this rocking of<br>
the upper looper drive plate 1005, the pin 1005a which is mounted on<br>
the upper looper drive plate 1005 in a protruding manner slides in and<br>
along the groove 1008a formed in the lower looper drive plate 1008 so as to<br>
rock the lower looper drive plate 1008. Due to this rocking of the lower looper<br>
drive plate 1008, the lower looper 1010 is rocked by way of the lower looper drive<br>
link 1009 so that the over-edge stitching is formed by the upper looper thread<br>
and the lower looper thread (now shown in the drawing) which respectively pass<br>
through the upper looper 1007 and the lower looper 1010.<br>
Disadvantage of such prior art construction has already been explained.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Preferred embodiments in which looper and cutter drive mechanisms of<br>
the sewing machine of the present invention are applied to a lockstitch/over-edge<br>
stitch sewing machine are explained in conjunction with the drawings.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, the lockstitch/over-edge stitch sewing machine<br>
includes a lockstitch forming mechanism 100 which forms a lockstitch portion<br>
consisting of a stitch parallel to a surface of a work and a stitch perpendicular to<br>
the surface of the work and a looper drive mechanism 50 which forms an over-<br>
edge stitch portion on the surface of the work.<br>
Since this lockstitch forming mechanism 100 has a known (well-known)<br>
structure as disclosed in Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication 117148/1974,<br>
Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication 154448/1977, Japanese Laid-open<br>
Patent Publication 108547/1978, Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication<br>
60052/1979, Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication 110049/1979, Japanese<br>
Laid-open Patent Publication 35676/1980, Japanese Laid-open Patent<br>
Publication 113490/1980, Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication 146190/1980,<br>
Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication 3091/1981 and the like, the detailed<br>
explanation of the lockstitch forming mechanism 100 is omitted.<br>
However, to simply explain the constitution of the lockstitch forming<br>
mechanism, as shown in Fig. 2, the lockstitch forming mechanism 100 includes a<br>
needle 10 which is fixedly secured to a needle bar 11 and which performs the<br>
upward and downward movement while drawing a trace L10 in a vertical<br>
direction relative to a throat plate 8 and a rotary hook 20 which performs a<br>
horizontal rotational movement while drawing a trace L20 at the same cycle with<br>
the upward and downward movement of the needle 10. Here, the upper thread 1<br>
which is made to pass through the needle 10 capable of performing<br>
the reciprocating movement in the vertical direction and passing through a work<br>
mounted on the throat plate 8 every one stitch feed of the work is, at the time of<br>
elevating the upper thread 1 from a lowermost position of the needle 10,<br>
intercepted by a loop-taker point 21 of the rotary hook 20 which accommodates<br>
the lower thread 2 below the throat plate 8 so as to make the upper thread 1 and<br>
the lower thread 2 interlace each other thus forming a lockstitch portion 6 made<br>
of a stitch parallel to a surface of the work and a stitch perpendicular to the<br>
surface of the work. The needle bar 11 performs the upward and downward<br>
movement by means of a needle bar drive portion MT1 having a needle bar<br>
crank which constitutes a motion transfer mechanism vertically slidably<br>
supported on a needle frame 12 which has an upper end portion thereof pivotally<br>
supported on a frame FR. Further, the rotary hook (loop-taker point) 20 can<br>
perform not only the full rotation but also the half rotation. That is, it is sufficient<br>
for the rotary hook 20 so long as the trace L20 of the rotary hook 20 can<br>
intersect the trace L10 of the needle 10 so that the upper thread 1 can be<br>
intercepted by the loop-taker point 21.<br>
Further, as shown in Fig. 1, in the lockstitch/over-edge stitch sewing<br>
machine, when a sewing person rotates a stitch changeover knob NB so as to<br>
changeover a pattern stitch changeover dial DL to various stitch mode<br>
corresponding to the rotational positions of the stitch changeover knob NB, a<br>
linear stitching, a zigzag stitching and the like can be performed. The lockstitch<br>
forming mechanism 100 corresponding to these stitching modes has the known<br>
(well-known) structure as disclosed in Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication<br>
50853/1973, Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication 32754/1974, Japanese<br>
Laid-open Patent Publication 73754/1975, Japanese Laid-open Patent<br>
Publication 4646/1979, Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication 6643/1979,<br>
Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication 120057/1979, Japanese Laid-open<br>
Patent Publication 16676/1980, Japanese Laid-open Utility Model 216/1980,<br>
Japanese Laid-open Utility Model 4787/1980, Japanese Laid-open Utility Model<br>
8406/1980 and the like. For example, the lockstitch forming mechanism 100 has<br>
a pattern stitch generating device (not shown in the drawing) or a stitch<br>
changeover device 110 which generates the zigzag stitching or the pattern<br>
stitching in cooperation with the fabric feeding by moving the needle 10 in the<br>
direction perpendicular to the fabric feeding direction every one stitch feed at the<br>
time of performing the upward and downward movement. In the lockstitch/ over-<br>
edge stitch sewing machine shown in Fig.1, the pattern stitch generating device<br>
and the stitch changeover device 110 are integrally formed as a unit, wherein the<br>
pattern stitch generating device is incorporated in a rear portion of the stitch<br>
changeover device 110.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, this stitch changeover device 110 includes<br>
a stitch changeover shaft 111 which is rotated by the manipulation of the stitch<br>
changeover knob NB and sets a pattern stitches and the pattern stitch<br>
changeover dial DL which is fixedly secured to a manipulation side shaft end of<br>
the stitch changeover shaft 111 on which various stitches are displayed. The<br>
stitch changeover device 110 is further provided with a mechanism in which<br>
when the sewing person selectively changes over the stitch by manipulating the<br>
stitch changeover knob NB, a necessary cam is selected from various cams of<br>
the pattern stitch generating device and a needle swing quantity, a needle swing<br>
position and a needle feed quantity are set.<br>
Further, the pattern stitching generating device and the stitch changeover<br>
device 110 perform a drive control of the lockstitch forming mechanism 100 by<br>
way of a needle stitching control portion 520. The needle stitching control portion<br>
520 includes a needle-bar pulling bar 526 which has one end thereof connected<br>
to the pattern stitch generating device and the other end thereof connected to<br>
the needle bar drive portion MT1 of the lockstitch forming mechanism 100 and<br>
reciprocally moves the needle bar 11 in the leftward and rightward direction in<br>
the needle frame 12 of the needle bar drive portion MT1 due to the drive<br>
transmitted from the pattern stitch generating device, a needle stitching transfer<br>
cam 527 fixedly secured to the stitch changeover shaft 111 of the stitch<br>
changeover device 110 in place, a needle stitching transfer arm 536 which is<br>
engaged with the needle stitching transfer cam 527 and is rotatably secured to<br>
the frame FR using a stepped screw 537 and a needle stitching transfer pawl<br>
522 which is connected to the needle stitching transfer arm 536 by way of the<br>
needle stitching transfer link 539 and is engaged with the needle-bar pulling bar<br>
526.<br>
The needle-bar pulling bar 526 is provided with a spring engaging pin<br>
526c in a protruding manner and a tension spring 529 is extended between this<br>
spring engaging pin 526c and the frame FR. Accordingly, the needle-bar pulling<br>
bar 526 is always biased in the left direction as seen from a front view of the<br>
sewing machine. Further, the needle-bar pulling bar 526 is provided with a<br>
needle stitching transfer pin 526d which is engaged with the needle stitching<br>
transfer pawl 522 in a protruding manner. The needle stitching transfer pawl 522<br>
which is engaged with the needle stitching transfer pin 526d is fixedly secured to<br>
a needle stitching adjustment plate 521 by a screw 525. The needle stitching<br>
adjustment plate 521 is rotatably connected to one end of the needle stitching<br>
transfer link 539 by means of a screw 523. Here, the needle stitching adjustment<br>
plate 521 and the needle stitching transfer pawl 522 which are secured by<br>
means of the screw 525 are rotatably fixed to the frame FR by means of the<br>
screw 524 in an integrated state. The other end of the needle stitching transfer<br>
link 539 is rotatably connected by a bolt 540 to an intermediate arm 536c formed<br>
on the needle stitching transfer arm 536 in a protruding manner toward the<br>
needle stitching transfer link 539 in the vicinity of a hole 536e which allows a<br>
stepped screw 537 to pass therethrough.<br>
Further, a security pin 536b is formed in protruding manner on an upper<br>
side arm 536a arranged at an upper portion of the needle stitching transfer arm<br>
536 and this security pin 536b is engaged with the needle stitching transfer cam<br>
527. Here, a recessed portion 527a is formed in the needle stitching transfer<br>
cam 527 so as to allow the security pin 536b of the needle stitching transfer arm<br>
536 to enter therein in a protruding manner. Further, a tension spring 538 is<br>
extended between a lower side arm 536d arranged at a lower portion of the<br>
needle stitching transfer arm 536 and the frame FR.<br>
Due to such a constitution, when the sewing machine is seen from the<br>
front side thereof, the needle stitching transfer arm 536 is resiliently biased in the<br>
clockwise direction about the stepped screw 537 as the center so that it<br>
becomes possible to make the security pin 536b of the needle stitching transfer<br>
arm 536 enter the recessed portion 527a of the needle stitching transfer cam<br>
527 in a protruding manner.<br>
Further, the needle control portion 520 includes a needle stitching transfer<br>
arm holding plate 532 which is operated by an over-edge stitching changeover<br>
button BT mounted on a front cover of a sewing machine body (not shown in the<br>
drawing) and allows the needle stitching transfer arm 536 to rotate in the<br>
clockwise direction when the sewing machine is seen from the front side thereof.<br>
The over-edge stitching changeover button BT is always resiliently biased in the<br>
direction away from the front cover of the sewing machine body by a<br>
compression spring 534. Further, to prevent the over-edge stitching changeover<br>
button BT from being disengaged from the front cover of the sewing machine<br>
body due to the biasing force of the compression spring 534, the over-edge<br>
stitching changeover button BT is engaged with the front cover of the sewing<br>
machine body by means of a retainer ring 535 for shaft such that the push<br>
manipulation of the over-edge stitching changeover button BT into the front<br>
cover of the sewing machine body can be performed.<br>
The needle stitching transfer arm holding plate 532 is provided with a<br>
receiving portion 532a which is to be pressed by a distal end of the over-edge<br>
stitching changeover button BT at one end thereof and is provided with a holding<br>
portion 532b for supporting an end portion of the upper-side arm 536a of the<br>
needle stitching transfer arm 536. Such a needle stitching transfer arm holding<br>
plate 532 is rotatably mounted on a needle by means of a stepped screw<br>
533, while needle stitching transfer arm holding base 530 is fixedly secured to<br>
the frame FR by a screw 531. Further, to resiliently bias the needle stitching<br>
transfer arm holding plate 532 in the clockwise direction as seen from above, a<br>
spring engaging portion 532c is formed on the needle stitching transfer arm<br>
holding plate 532, a spring engaging portion 530a is formed on the needle<br>
stitching transfer arm holding base 530, and a tension spring 540 is extended<br>
between the spring engaging portion 532c and the spring engaging portion 530a.<br>
Due to such a constitution, a holding portion 532b of the needle stitching transfer<br>
arm holding plate 532 is brought into pressure contact with an end portion of the<br>
upper arm 536a of the needle stitching transfer arm 536.<br>
Further, the needle stitching transfer arm holding base 530 is provided<br>
with a stopper 532b which restricts a pushing quantity at the time of manipulating<br>
the over-edge stitching changeover button BT. Due to such a constitution, when<br>
the pushing manipulation of the over-edge stitching changeover button BT is<br>
performed, although the needle stitching transfer arm holding plate 532 is rotated<br>
about the stepped screw 533 as the center in the counter-clockwise direction as<br>
seen from above, the rotation is restricted by the stopper 530b of the needle<br>
stitching transfer arm holding base 530 and hence, the restriction of the pushing<br>
quantity at the time of manipulating the over-edge stitching changeover button<br>
BT can be achieved.<br>
The manner of lockstitch forming operation by the lockstitch forming<br>
mechanism 100 having such a constitution is explained in conjunction with Fig. 1<br>
and Fig. 5.<br>
The needle 10 performs the upward and downward movement by the<br>
power transmitted from the rotary shaft pivotally mounted on the frame FR of the<br>
lockstitch/ over-edge stitch sewing machine, that is, the upper shaft S1 by way of<br>
the needle bar drive portion MT1. Further, the upper shaft S1 performs the<br>
upward and downward movement of the needle thread take-up 730 which pulls<br>
up or feeds the needle thread by means of a motion transfer mechanism 71 (Fig.<br>
10). This upper shaft S1 is rotatably driven by power transmitted to a hand pulley<br>
HP from a motor M by way of a timing belt TB1. Further, the needle frame 12<br>
which slidably supports the needle bar 11 to which the needle 10 is fixedly<br>
secured is shifted to the left and right positions every needle by the needle-bar<br>
pulling bar 526 which is subjected to a drive control of the pattern stitch<br>
generating device. In the throat plate 8, the needle stitching hole PS is formed in<br>
a laterally elongated shape such that the needle stitching hole PS allows the<br>
shifting of the needle 10 in the left and right positions.<br>
The rotary hook 20 is rotated by power transmitted from a rotary shaft<br>
pivotally supported on the frame FR of the lockstitch/over-edge stitch sewing<br>
machine, that is, a lower shaft S2 by way of a rotary hook drive screw gear MT2<br>
which constitutes the motion transfer mechanism. The rotary hook drive screw<br>
gear MT2 is provided for transmitting the rotational movement from the lower<br>
shaft S2 to the rotary hook 20 by converting 90 degrees in the feeding direction,<br>
wherein a driven-side gear 202 is fixedly secured to the rotary hook 20 and a<br>
drive-side gear 201 (Fig. 6) is fixedly secured to the lower shaft S2 by a fitting<br>
engagement. The lower shaft S2 is rotatably driven in synchronism with the<br>
upper shaft S1 by means of a timing belt TB2 at a rotational speed increased<br>
twice compared with the rotational speed of the upper shaft (1 : 2). The timing of<br>
this rotary hook 20 is adjusted such that the rotary hook 20 is rotated twice per<br>
one upward and downward movement of the needle 10 and the loop-taker point<br>
21 of the rotary hook 20 intercepts the loop of upper thread 1 when the needle<br>
10 is elevated from the lowermost position.<br>
A feed quantity of a feed dog FB for feeding the fabric is also subjected to<br>
the drive control of the pattern stitch generating device. The fabric feed<br>
movement of the feed dog FB constitutes one step of the fabric feeding wherein<br>
a feed drive portion 120 having a triangular cam is driven by the lower shaft S2,<br>
elevates the feed dog FB so as to push the work upwardly, makes the feed dog<br>
FB advance while maintaining the elevated state so as to move the work in the<br>
frontward direction, lowers the feed dog FB so as to leave the work on the throat<br>
plate 8, and retracts the feed dog FB to the original position.<br>
Further, as shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, the lockstitch/over-edge sewing<br>
machine is provided with a looper drive mechanism 50 which forms an over-edge<br>
stitch portion 7 by an upper looper thread 3 and a lower looper thread 4 which<br>
are respectively made to pass through an upper looper 30 which performs a<br>
reciprocating movement drawing a substantially arcuate trace L30 extending<br>
above and below the throat plate 8 and intersects the trace L10 of the needle 10<br>
above the throat plate 8 and a lower looper 40 which draws a substantially<br>
arcuate trace L40 below the throat plate 8 and intersects the trace L10 of the<br>
needle 10 and the trace L30 of the upper looper 30 respectively.<br>
The looper drive mechanism 50 is provided with a looper drive portion 60<br>
(Fig. 6 and Fig. 7) which has a following constitution. That is, the upper looper 30<br>
and the lower looper 40 are respectively disposed below the throat plate 8.<br>
Respective loop-taker points 31, 41 of the upper looper 30 and the lower looper<br>
40 are arranged in the direction such that the loop-taker points 31, 41 pass a<br>
front side of the needle 10 as seen in the stitching direction. The upper looper 30<br>
and the lower looper 40 are driven such that the upper looper 30 and the lower<br>
looper 40 perform movements having the traces L30, L40 on planes substantially<br>
parallel to each other. The upper looper thread 3 which is made to pass through<br>
the upper looper 30 which performs the reciprocating movement drawing the<br>
arcuate trace L30 which intersects the trace L10 of the needle 10 above the<br>
throat plate 8 and passes through the throat plate 8 is intercepted by the needle<br>
10 descending from the uppermost position when the upper looper 30 is<br>
descended from an uppermost position.<br>
The lower looper thread 4 which is made to pass through the lower looper<br>
40 which performs the reciprocating movement drawing the trace L40 which<br>
intersects the trace L10 of the needle 10 and the trace L30 of the upper looper<br>
30 below the throat plate 8 is intercepted by the descending needle 10 below the<br>
throat plate 8 when the lower looper 40 is moved from one end to the other end<br>
of the trace L40. The lower looper thread 4 is intercepted by the upper looper 30<br>
elevating from the lowermost position when the lower looper 40 is moved to the<br>
other end. Due to such a constitution, the upper looper thread 3 and the lower<br>
looper thread 4 are interlooped with each other at the edge portion 5c of the<br>
work 5 and, at the same time, the upper looper thread 3 is interlooped with the<br>
lockstitch portion 6 through an upper surface 5a of the work 5, and the lower<br>
looper thread 4 is interlooped with the lockstitch portion 6 through a lower<br>
surface 5b of the work 5 thus forming the over-edge stitch portion 7.<br>
The looper drive portion 60 is disposed below the throat plate 8 and, as<br>
shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, includes a crank 61b which is mounted on one end of<br>
a looper drive shaft 61 to which the rotational movement is transmitted from the<br>
lower shaft S2, by way of a clutch 500 and is driven by the lower shaft S2, a<br>
lower looper drive link 62 which is connected to the crank 61 b, a lower looper<br>
mounting arm 63 which is connected to the lower looper drive link 62 and carries<br>
the lower looper 40, an upper looper mounting arm 64 which is journalled in the<br>
frame FR and carries the upper looper 30 at one end thereof, and an upper<br>
looper drive link 65 which connects the lower looper drive link 62 and the upper<br>
looper mounting arm 64. These crank 61c and the like are incorporated into a<br>
looper base 601 mounted on the frame FR.<br>
To be more specific, the looper drive shaft 61 is rotatably secured to the<br>
looper base 601 and a crank pin 61c of the crank 61b is rotatably connected to<br>
one end of the lower looper drive link 62. This lower looper drive link 62 has the<br>
other end thereof rotatably connected to the one end of the lower looper<br>
mounting arm 63 and the other end of the lower looper mounting arm 63 is<br>
pivotally supported on the looper base 601. Further, the other end of the upper<br>
looper mounting arm 64 is pivotally mounted on the upper looper mounting arm<br>
shaft 602 fixedly secured to the looper base 601.<br>
The over-edge stitching operation by the looper drive portion 60 having<br>
such a constitution is explained in conjunction with Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7 and Fig.<br>
8.<br>
When the lower shaft S2 is rotated, the looper drive shaft 61 performs the<br>
rotational movement by way of the clutch 500 and the lower looper drive link 62<br>
connected to the crank 61 b of the looper drive shaft 61 transfers or converts this<br>
rotational movement into the reciprocating movement in the leftward and<br>
rightward direction. When the lower looper drive link 62 performs the<br>
reciprocating movement in the leftward and rightward direction, the lower looper<br>
mounting arm 63 is rocked about a pivoting point of the lower looper mounting<br>
arm 63 to the looper base 601 and hence, the lower looper 40 which is carried by<br>
the lower looper 63 rocks in an arcuate shape below the throat plate 8 between<br>
the right side and the left side of the needle 10 as seen from the front side of the<br>
sewing machine [Fig. 2 (a)].<br>
Further, when the lower looper drive link 62 performs the reciprocating<br>
movement in the leftward and rightward direction, due to an upper looper drive<br>
link 65 which connects the lower looper drive link 62 and the upper looper<br>
mounting arm 64, the upper looper mounting arm 64 transfers the leftward and<br>
rightward reciprocating movement to the upward and the downward reciprocating<br>
movement about the upper looper mounting arm shaft 602 of the looper base<br>
601 as the center. When the upper looper mounting arm 64 performs the<br>
upward and the downward reciprocating movement about the upper looper<br>
mounting arm shaft 602 as the center, the upper looper 30 rocks in an arcuate<br>
shape between a position located at the right side of the needle 10 and below<br>
the loop-taker point 41 of the lower looper 40 and a position located at the left<br>
side of the needle 10 and above the throat plate 8 as seen from the front side of<br>
the sewing machine [Fig. 2(a)].<br>
In the clutch 500 which transmits the power from the lower shaft S2 to<br>
such a looper drive portion 60 or interrupts such a power transmission, at the<br>
time of forming the over-edge stitch portion 7, the power is transmitted from the<br>
lower shaft S2 to the looper drive shaft 51 so as to form the lockstitch portion 6<br>
and the over-edge stitch portion 7 and, at the time of forming the lockstitch<br>
portion 6, the upper looper 30 is shunted at the lowermost position and the<br>
power transmission from the lower shaft S2 to the looper drive shaft 51 is<br>
interrupted so as to form the lockstitch portion 6 [Fig. 2 (b)]. Here, the looper<br>
drive portion 60 includes a looper drive screw gear MT3 which constitutes the<br>
motion transfer mechanism (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 6, this looper drive screw<br>
gear MT3 is provided for transmitting the rotational movement from the lower<br>
shaft S2 to the looper drive portion 60 after converting the direction of the<br>
rotational movement by 90 degrees in the feed direction, wherein a driven-side<br>
gear 509 is fixedly secured to the other end of the looper drive shaft 61 which is<br>
rotatably secured to the looper base 601, while the drive-side gear 505 is slidably<br>
fitted on the lower shaft S2.<br>
Further, the clutch 500 includes a looper drive screw gear stopper 503<br>
which is fixedly secured to the frame FR by a screw 504 and is fitted into a<br>
recessed portion 505b formed in one end of the drive-side gear 505, a clutch<br>
catcher 506 which is fixedly secured to one end of the lower shaft S2 and is<br>
provided with a clutch engaging recessed portion 506a in which a clutch pawl<br>
505c formed on the other end of the drive-side gear 505 is fitted into an end<br>
surface thereof, a clutch spring 508 which is loosely fitted on the lower shaft S2<br>
between the drive-side gear 201 of the rotary hook drive screw gear MT2 and the<br>
drive-side gear 505 of the looper drive screw gear MT3 and biases the drive-side<br>
gear 505 such that the clutch pawl 505c of the drive-side gear 505 is engaged<br>
with the clutch engaging recessed portion 506a of the clutch catcher 506, and a<br>
clutch changeover link 501 which is slidably mounted on the frame FR and a<br>
looper drive screw gear stopper 503 fixedly secured to the frame FR by means of<br>
stepped screws 502 and is provided with an L-shaped distal end portion 501a<br>
which is fitted into a movable groove 505a formed in the drive-side gear 505 of<br>
the looper drive screw gear MT3 at one end thereof.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, the clutch changeover link 501 is connected<br>
to the clutch control portion 510 of the clutch 500 which is operated in an<br>
interlocking manner with the needle stitching control portion 520. The clutch<br>
control portion 510 includes a clutch control link 511 which connects the other<br>
end of the clutch changeover link 501 and an end portion of the lower-side arm<br>
536d of the needle stitching transfer arm 536 provided to the needle stitching<br>
control portion 520.<br>
The clutch control link 511 is provided with an elongated hole 511 a at an<br>
end portion thereof which is connected with an end portion of lower arm 536d of<br>
the needle stitching transfer arm 536 and is slidable by connecting the clutch<br>
control link 511 with the needle stitching transfer arm 536 by a stepped<br>
screw 514. Further, a connection hole 511b is formed in the other<br>
end of the clutch control link 511 which is connected to the other end of the<br>
clutch changeover link 501, an adjusting elongated hole 501b is formed in the<br>
other end of the clutch changeover link 501, a connecting block 512 is loosely<br>
fitted into a connecting hole 511b of the clutch control link 511, and the clutch<br>
changeover link 501 is fixedly secured to the connecting block 512 such that the<br>
position of the clutch changeover link 501, can be adjusted by way of a screw<br>
513 and a washer 515 along with an elongated hole 501b for adjustment.<br>
Further, a tension spring 517 is extended between a spring engaging hole 511c<br>
formed in the clutch control link 511 and a spring engaging hole formed in a<br>
lower arm 536d of the needle stitching transfer arm 536. Due to such a<br>
constitution, the clutch control link 511 is always resiliently biased in the direction<br>
that the clutch control link 511 is pulled toward the needle stitching transfer arm<br>
536.<br>
In the clutch 500 and the clutch control portion 510 having the above-<br>
mentioned constitutions, in performing the over-edge stitching, since the needle<br>
stitching transfer arm 536 is rotated in the clockwise direction by the biasing<br>
force of the tension spring 538 as seen from the front side of the sewing<br>
machine, the clutch control link 511 connected to the end portion of the lower<br>
arm 536d of the needle stitching transfer arm 536 is moved in the leftward<br>
direction and hence, the clutch changeover link 501 connected to the clutch<br>
control link 511 is also moved in the leftward direction. When the clutch<br>
changeover link 501 is moved in the leftward direction, the L-shaped distal end<br>
portion 501a of the clutch changeover link 501 which is fitted into the moving<br>
groove 505a of the drive-side gear 505 of the looper drive screw gear MT3<br>
moves the drive-side gear 505 in the leftward direction so that the recessed<br>
portion 505b of the drive-side gear 505 is disengaged from the looper drive<br>
screw gear stopper 503 and simultaneously the clutch pawl 505c of the drive-<br>
side gear 505 is engaged with the clutch engaging recessed portion 506a of the<br>
clutch catcher 506 fixedly secured to the lower shaft S2 [Fig. 9 (a)]. In this<br>
manner, since the rotational movement of the lower shaft S2 is transmitted to the<br>
driven-side gear 509 by way of the drive-side gear 505, the upper looper 30 and<br>
the lower looper 40 of the looper drive portion 60 are driven.<br>
Further, in finishing the over-edge stitching, by rotating the needle<br>
stitching transfer arm 536 in the counter-clockwise direction as seen from the<br>
front side of the sewing machine against the biasing force of the tension spring<br>
538, the clutch control link 511 connected to the end portion of the lower arm<br>
536d of the needle stitching transfer arm 536 is moved in the rightward direction<br>
and hence, the clutch changeover link 501 connected to the clutch control link<br>
511 is also moved in the rightward direction.<br>
When the clutch changeover link 501 is moved in the rightward direction,<br>
the L-shaped distal end portion 501a of the clutch changeover link 501 which is<br>
fitted into the moving groove 505a of the drive-side gear 505 of the looper drive<br>
screw gear MT3 moves the drive-side gear 505 in the rightward direction so that<br>
the recessed portion 505b of the drive-side gear 505 can be engaged with the<br>
looper drive screw gear stopper 503 against the biasing force of the compression<br>
spring 508 and simultaneously the clutch engaging recessed portion 506a of<br>
the clutch catcher 506 fixedly secured to the lower shaft S2 is disengaged from<br>
the clutch pawl 505c of the drive-side gear 505 [Fig. 9 (b)]. In this manner, since<br>
the rotational movement of the lower shaft S2 is not transmitted to the driven-<br>
side gear 509, the driven gear 502 is not rotated and hence, the operations of<br>
the upper looper 30 and the lower looper 40 of the looper drive portion 60 are<br>
stopped.<br>
The lockstictch/over-edge stitch sewing machine provided with such a<br>
looper drive mechanism 50 may by further provided with a cutter drive<br>

by way of a clutch 75 (Fig. 10) which transmits power to the upper cutter 72 at<br>
the time of operating the cutter of the cutter drive portion 74 and pivotally moves<br>
the cutter drive portion 74 to a shunting position and interrupts the transmission<br>
of power to the upper cutter 72 at the time that the cutters of the cutter drive<br>
portion 74 are not operated.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, Fig. 10, Fig. 11 and Fig. 12, the motion transfer<br>
mechanism 71 is constituted by a first quadric crank chain LK1 which consists of<br>
four links 76, 77(78), 79, 80 connecting the upper shaft S1 as the rotary shaft<br>
and the frame FR and a second quadric crank chain LK2 which consists of four<br>
links 79, 81, 82, 83 while using one link 79 of the first quadric crank chain LK1<br>
and a joint N4 of the frame FR and using the drive portion 751 of the clutch 75 as<br>
another link 82. In the first quadric crank chain LK1, the link 78 is fixedly secured<br>
to the link 77 while the link 78 is connected to the link 80. Here, the link 76 is a<br>
fixed link.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Fig. 11, the motion transfer mechanism 71 is<br>
provided for taking the motion from a mechanism which drives a needle thread<br>
take-up 730 upwardly and downwardly using power transmitted from the upper<br>
shaft S1 as the rotary shaft and transferring the motion to a motion to move the<br>
upper cutter 72 upwardly and downwardly. However, the motion transfer<br>
mechanism 71 may be provided for taking a motion from a mechanism which<br>
drives the needle 10 upwardly and downwardly using power transmitted from the<br>
upper shaft S1 as the rotary shaft and transferring the motion to a motion to<br>
move the upper cutter 72 upwardly and downwardly. The needle thread take-up<br>
730 is driven upwardly and downwardly by the power transmitted from the upper<br>
shaft S1 by way of four links 76, 77(78), 79, 80.<br>
The clutch 75 includes, as shown in Fig. 10 and Fig. 13, a pin 84 which is<br>
formed on the other link 82 as a drive portion 751 and an elongated groove 85<br>
which is formed in the upper cutter 72 as a driven portion 741 and in which the<br>
pin 84 is fitted. The pin 84 which constitutes the drive portion 751 is threadedly<br>
mounted in a mounting hole 752 formed in a lower bent end portion of the other<br>
link 82 using a nut 753.<br>
In the cutter drive portion 74, the lower cutter 73 is slidably mounted on a<br>
cutter drive plate 742 which constitutes the driven portion 741. To achieve such a<br>
slide structure, the lower cutter 73 is fixedly secured to the slide plate 744 by<br>
small bolts 743. A protrusion 746 of a pi votally movable member 745 is fitted in<br>
an opening 747 of the slide plate 744 and an opening 748 of the cutter drive<br>
plate 742 and the pivotally movable member 745 is fixedly secured to a stopper<br>
749 by small bolts 760. Due to such a constitution, the cutter drive portion 74<br>
can slidably mount the slide plate 744, that is, the lower cutter 73 within a relative<br>
dimensional, relationship between the openings 747, 748 and the protrusion 746.<br>
The upper cutter 72 is replaceably mounted on the cutter drive plate 742<br>
of the cutter drive portion 74 by a pin 761. The cutter drive portion 74 is provided<br>
with a cutter-side pressure resilient member 88 which presses the upper cutter<br>
72 to the lower cutter 73. The cutter-side pressure resilient member 88 is<br>
constituted by a resilient U-shaped member and is pivotally mounted on the slide<br>
plate 744 by a pin 763. In the state that the upper cutter 72 is mounted on the<br>
cutter drive plate 742 by the pin 761, a resilient U-shaped member 762 is fitted<br>
on the cutter-side pressure resilient member 88 so that the resilient U-shaped<br>
member 762 is held and the upper cutter 72 is pressed to the lower cutter 73.<br>
As shown in Fig. 14 and Fig. 15, the lower cutter 73 includes a locating<br>
locking-portion 87 which locates the cutter drive portion 74 to a locating recessed<br>
portion 86a of a locating plate 86 provided to the throat plate 8 to a needle<br>
stitching position PS of the needle 10 at the time of operating the cutters. The<br>
locating plate 86 provided with the locating recessed portion 86a is constituted<br>
such that the position of the locating plate 86 can be adjusted in the leftward and<br>
rightward direction so as to change the stitching width W to the needle stitching<br>
position PS. That is, the locating plate 86 is incorporated in the throat plate 8 in<br>
such a manner that the locating plate 86 can adjust the position thereof in the<br>
leftward and rightward direction wherein the position of the locating plate 86 can<br>
be adjusted in the stitch width W direction to the recessed portion 8a formed in<br>
the throat plate 8. After being located, the locating plate 86 is fixedly secured to<br>
the throat plate 8 by bolts or the like.<br>
The lower cutter 73 is slidably mounted in the cutter drive portion 74 and<br>
the cutter drive portion 74 is provided with a locating biasing member 89 which<br>
presses the locating locking portion 87 into the locating recessed portion 86a of<br>
the locating plate 86 provided to the throat plate 8 at the time of performing the<br>
cutting operation. The locating biasing member 89 is interposed between the<br>
pivotally movable member 745 and a receiving plate 764 which is fixedly<br>
secured by a pin 763 inserted into a mounting hole formed in the pivotally<br>
movable member 745 and presses the locating engaging member 87 into the<br>
locating recessed portion 86a of the locating plate 86 at the time of performing<br>
the cutting operation.<br>
The pivotally movable member 745 of the cutter drive portion 74 is<br>
pivotally supported in a pivot hole 767 of the stopper 766 by a pin 765. The<br>
stopper 766 is fixedly secured to the frame FR by a stopper arm 768. In this<br>
manner, the cutter drive portion 74 is pivotally supported on the frame FR and<br>
slidably guides the upper cutter 72.<br>
Further, as shown in Fig. 16, without using the locating biasing member<br>
89 and the receiving plate 764, the lower cutter 73 may be slidably mounted in<br>
the cutter drive portion 74 and the cutter drive portion 74 may be provided with a<br>
locating eccentric cam 90 which presses the locating locking portion 87 into the<br>
locating recessed portion 86a of the locating plate 86 provided to the throat plate<br>
8 at the time of performing the cutting operation. The cutter drive portion 74<br>
provided with the eccentric cam 90 includes a cutter drive body 942 which is<br>
provided with a groove 85" into which a pin 84 of the drive portion 751<br>
constituting a part of the clutch 75 is fitted and to which the upper cutter 72 is<br>
fixedly secured, a slide guide body 946 which is disposed parallel to the cutter<br>
drive body 942, a slide body 944 which is disposed parallel to the slide guide<br>
body 946 and to which the lower cutter 73 is fixedly secured, and a slide shaft<br>
948 on which these three parts are slidably mounted in the order of the cutter<br>
drive body 942, the slide guide body 946 and the slide body 944.<br>
The slide guide body 946 is provided with a guide groove in which a<br>
protrusion 944a formed on the slide body 944 is slidably fitted in the axial<br>
direction of the slide shaft 948 and a pivotally movable member 945 which is<br>
engaged with the slide body 944 is fixedly mounted on the slide guide body 946.<br>
The slide guide body 946 is fixedly secured to the slide shaft 948 by a small bolt.<br>
The slide body 944 is provided with a groove portion which works as a cam<br>
follower at one end portion thereof and is moved upwardly or downwardly by the<br>
rotational movement of the locating eccentric cam 90 which is rotatably mounted<br>
by the manipulation of a manipulating knob 91 about an axis hole formed in the<br>
pivotally movable member 945. Further, a cutter-side biasing member 950 is<br>
fixedly secured to the cutter drive body 942 which presses the upper cutter 72 to<br>
the lower cutter 73. Further, the pivotally movable member 945 of the cutter drive<br>
portion 74 is pivotally supported in a pivot hole 767 of a stopper 766 by a pin.<br>
The stopper 766 is fixedly secured to the frame FR by the stopper arm 768. In<br>
this manner, the cutter drive portion 74 is pivotally mounted on the frame FR and<br>
slidably guides the upper cutter 72.<br>
According to the cutter drive portion 74 having such a constitution, by<br>
rotating the manipulation knob 91, the locating eccentric cam 90 is made offset<br>
so that the lower cutter 73 is moved upwardly and hence, the state that the<br>
locating locking portion 87 of the lower cutter 73 is fitted into the locating<br>
recessed portion 86a of the locating plate 86 provided to the throat plate 8 can<br>
be released. Further, with the rotational manipulation of the manipulating knob<br>
91, the lower cutter 73 is moved downwardly and hence, the locating locking<br>
portion 87 of the lower cutter 73 can be fitted into the locating recessed portion<br>
86a provided to the throat plate 8.<br>
The manner of lock stitch/over-edge stitch operation performed by the<br>
lock stitch/over-edge stitch sewing machine having the above-mentioned<br>
constitution is explained hereinafter.<br>
Here, the stitch of the lockstitch/over-edge stitch includes, as shown in<br>
Fig. 2, the lockstitch portion 6 consisting of the upper thread 1 and the lower<br>
thread 2 and the over-edge portion 7 consisting of two looper threads made of<br>
the upper looper thread 3 and the lower looper thread 4, wherein the stitch is<br>
formed by making the lockstitch portion 6 and the over-edge portion 7 intersect<br>
each other. That is, the upper thread 1 and the lower thread 2 respectively form<br>
stitches 1 a, 2a on an upper surface 5a and a lower surface 5b of the work, for<br>
example, the fabric 5 having a two-plied structure which are parallel to the fabric<br>
surface, and the upper thread 1 and the lower thread 2 are made to interlace<br>
each other in the vertical direction of the fabric 5, for example, at the center in<br>
the thickness-wise direction thus forming the stitch which penetrates the fabric 5<br>
whereby the lockstitch portion 6 is formed.<br>
On the other hand, the upper looper thread 3 and the lower looper thread<br>
4 are provided for forming the over-edge portion 7 which can prevent the<br>
unraveling of the edge portion 5c of the fabric 5. The upper looper thread 3 and<br>
the lower looper thread 4 interlace each other at the edge portion 5c of the<br>
fabric 5, the upper looper thread 3 penetrates the upper surface 5a of the fabric<br>
5 and intersects the upper end of the lockstitch portion 6 and the lower looper<br>
thread 4 penetrates the lower surface 5b of the fabric 5 and intersects the lower<br>
end of the lockstitch portion 6.<br>
In this manner, the stitch of the lockstitch / over-edge stitching is<br>
constituted by the upper thread 1 which constitutes a single thread, the lower<br>
thread 2 which constitutes the rotary hook thread, and two looper threads 3, 4,<br>
wherein the over-edge portion 7 formed by the looper threads 3, 4 intersect the<br>
lockstitch portion 6 formed of upper thread 1 and the lower thread 2 on both<br>
sides of the fabric 5 so that the lockstitch and the over-edge stitch are connected<br>
to each other thus forming the stitch.<br>
In the lockstitch/over-edge stitch sewing machine forming the stitch<br>
constituted by connecting both of the lockstitch and the over-edge stitch, to<br>
perform the over-edge stitching first of all, the stitch changeover knob. NB is<br>
manipulated by the sewing person so as to, for example, select the linear<br>
stitching and to set a feed quantity to an optimal quantity for the over-edge<br>
stitching such that the stitch changeover shaft 111 of the stitch changeover<br>
device 110 is rotated to a position where the security pin 536b of the needle<br>
stitching transfer arm 536 is protruded into the recessed portion 527a of the<br>
needle stitching changeover cam 527 (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4).<br>
In this state, when the sewing person pushes the over-edge stitch<br>
changeover button BT against the biasing force of the compression spring 534,<br>
the distal end of the over-edge stitch changeover button BT presses the<br>
receiving portion 532a of the needle stitching transfer arm holding plate 532 of<br>
the needle stitching control portion 520 so as to make the needle stitching<br>
transfer arm holding plate 532 rotate in the counter-clockwise direction. Due to<br>
this rotation, the stopper 532b of the needle stitching transfer arm holding plate<br>
532 is retracted and hence, the needle stitching transfer arm 536 supported by<br>
this stopper 532b is rotated in the clockwise direction about the stepped screw<br>
537 as the center by the biasing force of the tension spring 538. Accordingly, the<br>
security pin 515b of the needle stitching transfer arm 536 is protruded into the<br>
recessed portion 527a of the needle stitching transfer cam 527 until the security<br>
pin 515b comes into contact with a bottom surface of the recessed portion 527a<br>
(Fig. 3 and Fig. 4).<br>
Further, when the needle stitching transfer arm 536 is rotated in the<br>
clockwise direction about the stepped screw 537 as the center, the intermediate<br>
arm 536c of the needle stitching transfer arm 536 pushes up the needle stitching<br>
transfer link 539 connected to the needle stitching transfer arm 536, and the<br>
needle stitching adjustment plate 521 and the needle stitching transfer pawl 522<br>
which are integrally formed are rotated in the clockwise direction. Due to this<br>
rotation, the needle stitching transfer pawl 522 moves the needle-bar pulling bar<br>
526 which is biased in the leftward direction by the tension spring 529 in the<br>
rightward direction by way of the needle stitching transfer pin 526d fixedly<br>
secured to the needle-bar pulling bar 526 (Fig. 1 and Fig. 3).<br>
Accordingly, the irrespective of the needle stitching position control by the<br>
stitch changeover device 110, the needle stitching position can be shifted to the<br>
rightmost position which is optimal for the over-edge stitching. To prevent the<br>
worsening of the needle position accuracy of the rightmost position optimal for<br>
the over-edge stitching which may be brought about by the error of portions per<br>
se or the error generated in assembling, the needle stitching transfer pawl 522 is<br>
fixedly secured to the needle stitching adjustment plate 521 by the screw 525<br>
and when the needle position adjustment is necessary, the screw 525 is<br>
loosened and the position adjustment of the needle stitching transfer pawl 522<br>
can be performed.<br>
Further, when the needle stitching transfer arm 536 is rotated in the<br>
clockwise direction about the stepped screw 537 as the center, the clutch<br>
changeover link 501 is moved in the leftward direction by way of the clutch<br>
control link 511 connected to the end portion of the lower arm 536d of the needle<br>
stitching transfer arm 536 (Fig. 1, Fig. 3, Fig. 4 and Fig. 6). Accordingly, the L-<br>
shaped distal end portion 501a of the clutch changeover link 501 fitted into the<br>
moving groove 505a of the drive-side gear 505 of the looper drive screw gear<br>
MT3 moves the drive-side gear 505 in the leftward direction so as to disengage<br>
the recessed portion 505b of the drive-side gear 505 from the looper drive screw<br>
gear stopper 503 and to engage the clutch pawl 505c of the drive-side gear 505<br>
with the clutch engaging recessed portion 506a of the clutch catcher 506 fixedly<br>
secured to the lower shaft S2 [Fig. 9(b)]. Accordingly, the rotational movement<br>
of the lower shaft S2 is transmitted to the driven-side gear 509 by way of the<br>
drive-side gear 505 so that the upper looper 30 and the lower looper 40 of the<br>
looper drive portion 60 can be driven.<br>
In such a state that the upper looper 30 and the lower looper 40 of the<br>
looper drive portion 40 can be driven, the lockstitch portion 6 is formed such that<br>
the upper thread 1 which is made to pass through the needle 10 penetrates the<br>
fabric 5 following the upward and downward movement of the needle 10<br>
generated by the needle bar drive portion MT1 and thereafter the loop-taker<br>
point 21 of the rotary hook 20 intercepts the upper thread 1 at a point R when the<br>
needle 10 starts to elevate from the lowermost position so as to make the upper<br>
thread 1 and the lower thread 2 interlace with each other, and further, the lower<br>
thread 2 is pulled up when the upper thread 1 is pulled up by the needle 10 and<br>
the looper thread take-up 730. By repeating the above-mentioned operation<br>
every one stitch feed, the continuous lockstitch portion 6 is formed (Fig. 2).<br>
Further, in forming the over-edge stitch portion 7, when the upper looper<br>
30 disposed in the uppermost position performs the upward and downward<br>
movement of the upper looper mounting arm 64, the upper looper thread 3 is<br>
intercepted by the needle 10 in the midst P point of the descending of the upper<br>
looper mounting arm 64 and hence, the upper end of the lockstitch portion 6 and<br>
the upper looper thread 3 interlace each other on the upper surface of the fabric<br>
[Fig. 8(a)].<br>
Subsequently, at the time of performing the leftward and rightward<br>
reciprocating movement of the lower looper mounting arm 63, the lower looper<br>
thread 4 of the lower looper 40 moving in the rightward direction from the<br>
leftmost position is intercepted by the needle 10 descending from the uppermost<br>
position at a Q point and hence, the lower end of the lockstitch portion 6 and the<br>
lower looper thread 4 intersect each other on the lower surface of the fabric [Fig.<br>
8(b)]. Further, at the time of performing the leftward and rightward reciprocating<br>
movement of the lower looper mounting arm 63, the lower looper thread 4 of the<br>
lower looper 40 retracting in the rightward direction is intercepted by the upper<br>
looper 30 elevating from the lowermost position due to the upper looper<br>
mounting arm 64 at an S point and hence, the upper looper thread 3 and the<br>
lower looper thread 4 interloop each other at the edge portion 5c of the fabric 5<br>
whereby the over-edge portion 7 is formed (Fig. 2). By repeating the above-<br>
mentioned operation with one stitch feed as a cycle, the stitch which makes the<br>
over-edge portion 7 intersect respective lockstitch every one stitch can be<br>
obtained.<br>
Further, the rotational movement of the rotary shaft of the sewing<br>
machine, for example, the upper shaft S1 in the drawing is transferred into<br>
upward and downward movement by way of the motion transfer mechanism 71<br>
(Fig. 1, Fig. 10, Fig. 11 and Fig. 12) which is operated in an interlocking manner<br>
with the above-mentioned rotational movement. That is, when the upper shaft S1<br>
is rotated, the first quadric crank chain LK1 is rocked wherein the links 77, 78 are<br>
used as cranks and the link 80 is used as a connecting rod and the link 79 is<br>
used as a rocker arm. By the rocking of the link 79, the link 81 of the second<br>
quadric crank chain LK2 is rocked and the link 82 and accordingly the drive<br>
portion 751 of the clutch 75 performs the upward and downward movement.<br>
Here, the motion trace of the link 82 draws an elliptical trace due to the quadric<br>
crank chain mechanisms LK1, LK2 and draws an approximate straight line in the<br>
vertical direction at a PL point in the vicinity of the drive portion 751 so that the<br>
reaction from the cutter drive portion 74 is supported by a guide pin 754 held at<br>
the PL point of the link 82 which passes through an elongated guide hole 755a<br>
formed in the guide plate 755 fixedly secured to the frame FR (Fig. 10, Fig. 11<br>
and Fig. 13). Due to such a constitution, the motion of the drive portion 751 in<br>
the lateral direction is restricted and only the upward and downward motion can<br>
obtain a stroke t (Fig. 11) per one rotation of the upper shaft S1.<br>
The upward and downward motion obtained by the motion transfer<br>
performed by the motion transfer mechanism 71 is transmitted to the upper<br>
cutter 72 by way of the pin 84 of the drive portion 751 of the clutch 75 and the<br>
elongated groove 85 in which the pin 84 of the cutter drive plate 742 of the cutter<br>
drive portion 74 which constitutes the driven portion 741 is filled. In the cutter<br>
operable state (Fig. 14) in which the locating locking portion 87 of the lower<br>
cutter 73 is fitted into the locating recessed portion 86a of the locating plate 86<br>
provided to the throat plate 8 so that the cutter drive portion 74 is located to the<br>
needle stitching position P5 of the needle 10, the upper cutter 72 is slidably<br>
guided on the slide plate 744 by the cutter drive plate 742 of the cutter drive<br>
portion 74 pivotally mounted on the frame FR. In this cutter operable state, the<br>
cutter drive portion 74 is held in the vertical state around the pin 765 and the<br>
longitudinal direction of the elongated groove 85 is directed in the horizontal<br>
direction, the pin 84 of the drive portion 751 of the clutch 75 and the elongated<br>
groove 85 of the driven portion 741 allows the power transmission and hence,<br>
the power is transmitted to the upper cutter 72 at the time of performing the<br>
cutter operation of the cutter drive portion 74. Accordingly, the fabric edge 5c of<br>
the fabric 5 is cut by the upper cutter 72 which performs the upward and the<br>
downward movement and the lower cutter 73 which is cooperatively operated<br>
with the upper cutter 72.<br>
In this manner, by performing the lockstiching and the like while cutting<br>
the fabric edge 5c of the fabric 5, it becomes also possible to perform the over-<br>
edge stitching simultaneously with the lockstitching.<br>
Further, in transferring link the over-edge stitching to the lockstitching, by<br>
selecting the stitching other than the linear stitching with the manipulation of the<br>
stitch changeover knob NB after stopping the sewing machine, the stitch<br>
changeover shaft 111 of the stitch changeover device 110 is rotated and the<br>
security pin 536b of the needle stitching transfer arm 536 is disengaged from the<br>
recessed portion 527a of the needle stitching transfer cam 527 fixedly secured in<br>
a given position of the stitch changeover shaft 111 and hence, the needle<br>
stitching transfer arm 536 is rotated in the counter-clockwise direction by the<br>
needle stitching transfer cam 527 about the stepped screw 537 as the center<br>
against the biasing force of the tension spring 538 (Fig. 1, Fig. 3 and Fig. 4).<br>
Accordingly, the intermediate arm 536c of the needle stitching transfer arm 536<br>
pulls the needle stitching transfer link 539 connected to the needle stitching<br>
transfer arm 536 downwardly and hence, the needle stitching adjustment plate<br>
521 and the needle stitching transfer pawl 522 which are integrally formed are<br>
rotated in the counter-clockwise direction. When the needle stitching transfer<br>
pawl 522 is rotated in the counter-clockwise direction, the needle-bar pulling bar<br>
526 is moved in the leftward direction by the biasing force of the tension spring<br>
529 and hence, the position optimal for the lockstitching can be obtained.<br>
Further, when the needle stitching transfer arm 536 is rotated in the<br>
counter-clockwise direction about the stepped screw 537 as the center,<br>
the lower arm 536d of the needle stitching transfer arm 536 forces the<br>
clutch control link 511 to move in the rightward direction. However, when<br>
the recessed portion 505b of the drive-side gear 505 of the looper drive<br>
screw gear MT3 and the looper drive screw gear stopper 503 fixedly secured<br>
to the frame FR are not located at the same position, they cannot get the fitting<br>
engagement. In view of the above, the needle stitching transfer arm 536 forces<br>
the stepped screw 514 fixedly secured to the lower arm 536d to slide in the<br>
rightward direction in the elongated hole 511a of the clutch control link 511<br>
against the biasing force of the tension spring 517 (Fig. 1, Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 6<br>
and Fig. 9).<br>
Accordingly, by rotating the handpulley HP fixedly secured to the upper<br>
shaft S1 to a timing position of the lowermost position of the upper looper 30<br>
where the looper drive screw gear stopper 503 is fitted into the recessed portion<br>
505b of the drive-side gear 505, the clutch control link 511 is moved in the<br>
rightward direction due to the biasing force of the tension spring 517 so that the<br>
L-shaped distal end portion 501 a of the clutch changeover link 501 fitted into the<br>
moving groove 505a of the drive-side gear 505 can move the drive-side gear 505<br>
in the rightward direction. Accordingly, the clutch pawl 505c of the drive-side<br>
gear 505 is disengaged from the clutch engaging recessed portion 506a of the<br>
clutch catcher 506 fixedly secured to the lower shaft S2 and hence, the rotational<br>
movement of the lower shaft S2 is interrupted so that the drive-side gear 505<br>
cannot be rotated whereby it becomes possible to shunt the upper looper 30<br>
and the lower looper 40 of the looper drive portion 60 to a given position below<br>
the throat plate 8.<br>
In the above-mentioned embodiment, although the upper looper thread 3<br>
and the lower looper thread 4 respectively intersect all neighboring lockstitch<br>
portions 6, the over-edge portion 7 may intersect every other lockstitch portion 6<br>
as shown in Fig. 17(b), for example. In this case, the ratio of rotational speed<br>
between the lower shaft S2 and the looper drive portion 60 may be set such that<br>
the upper looper 30 and the lower looper 40 perform the motion of one cycle for<br>
only one cycle out of two cycles of motion of the needle 10.<br>
Further, although the stitches 1a, 2a of the upper thread 1 and the lower<br>
thread 2 are respectively linear in this embodiment, the stitches may be in a<br>
zigzag form every one stitch as shown in Fig. 17 (c) or may be in a polygonal line<br>
every other two or more stitches.<br>
On the other hand, unless the over-edge stitch changeover button BT is<br>
pushed, even when the needle stitching transfer arm 536 is biased in the<br>
clockwise direction about the stepped screw 537 as the center due to the biasing<br>
force of the tension spring 538, the rotation of the upper arm 536a of the needle<br>
stitching transfer arm 536 is restricted by the holding portion 532b of the needle<br>
stitching transfer arm holding plate 532. Accordingly, even when the lockstitch is<br>
selected by manipulating the stitch changeover knob NB, the security pin 536b of<br>
the needle stitching transfer arm 536 is not protruded into the recessed portion<br>
527a of the needle stitching transfer cam 527 (Fig. 1 and Fig. 3). Further, when<br>
other stitching is selected, since the stitch changeover knob NB is manipulated<br>
such that such a stitching can be performed and hence, the stitch changeover<br>
shaft 111 of the stitch changeover device 110 is rotated to a position where the<br>
security pin 536b of the needle stitching transfer arm 536 cannot be protruded<br>
into the recessed portion 527a of the needle stitching transfer cam 527 (Fig. 1<br>
and Fig. 3).<br>
Accordingly, in such a state, the needle stitch transfer pawl 522 cannot<br>
force the needle-bar pulling bar 526 to move in the rightward direction and the<br>
clutch changeover link 501 of the clutch control portion 510 is moved in the<br>
rightward direction due to the biasing force of the tension spring 517 and hence,<br>
the clutch pawl 505c of the drive-side gear 505 of the clutch 500 is disengaged<br>
from the recessed portion 506a of the clutch catcher 506 [Fig. 9 (a)].<br>
Accordingly, the screw gear stopper 503 is engaged with the recessed portion<br>
505b of the drive-side gear 505 so as to interrupt the rotational movement of the<br>
lower shaft S2 thus preventing the rotation of the drive-side gear 505 whereby<br>
the upper looper 30 and the lower looper 40 of the looper drive portion 60 can be<br>
shunted to a given position below the throat plate 8.<br>
Further, in the cutter non-operable state shown in Fig. 15 in which only the<br>
lockstitch is desired without cutting the fabric edge 5c of the fabric 5, the slide<br>
plate 744 is lifted or the eccentric cam 90 is rotated by the manipulation knob 91<br>
(Fig. 16) so that the state that the locating locking portion 87 of the lower cutter<br>
73 is fitted into the locating recessed portion 86a of the locating plate 86<br>
provided to the throat plate 8 is released and the cutter drive portion 74 is<br>
pivotally moved about the pin 765 to take the shunt position in the horizontal<br>
state. Accordingly, the longitudinal direction of the elongated groove 85 is<br>
directed in the vertical direction and hence, the pin 84 of the drive portion 751 of<br>
the clutch 75 only moves in the elongated groove 85 of the driven portion 741<br>
with a play so that the transmission of the power to the upper cutter 72 can be<br>
interrupted.<br>
In this manner, with the simple manipulation to pivotally move the cutter<br>
drive portion 74 to the shunt position in the horizontal state, the stitching<br>
operation can be changed over to the operation which performs only the<br>
lockstitching without cutting the fabric edge 5c of the fabric 5.<br>
According to the preferred embodiment to which the looper and cutter<br>
drive mechanisms of sewing machine of the present invention is applied to the<br>
lockstitch/ over-edge sewing machine, the horizontal rotary hook which performs<br>
the horizontal rotational movement is used. However, the present invention is<br>
not limited to such a rotary hook and any rotary hook may be used so long as the<br>
rotary hook can make the upper thread and the lower thread interlace each other<br>
when elevating the upper thread which is made to pass through the needle from<br>
the lowermost position of the needle thus forming the lockstitch portion made of<br>
stitches parallel to the surface of the work and the stitches perpendicular to the<br>
surface of the work.<br>
Further, the cutter drive mechanism 70, the needle stitching control<br>
portion 520, the clutch 500 and the clutch control portion 510 are not limited to<br>
the above-mentioned structures. So long as the cutter drive mechanism 70 can<br>
perform stitching while changing over the operation which performs lockstitching<br>
after cutting the fabric edge and the operation which performs lockstitching<br>
without cutting the fabric edge, the needle stitching control portion 520 shifts the<br>
needle stitching position in an interlocking manner with the manipulation of the<br>
over-edge stitching changeover button BT, the clutch 500 enables the formation<br>
of the lockstitch portion 6 and the over-edge stitch portion 7 at the time of<br>
forming over-edge stitch portion 7 and the formation of only the lockstitch portion<br>
6 at the time of forming the lockstitch portion 6, and the clutch control portion 510<br>
can control the clutch 500 in an interlocking manner with the stitch changeover<br>
knob NB, any structures can be used.<br>
Further, the looper drive portion 60 is not limited to the above-mentioned<br>
structure. So long as the looper drive portion 60 has a constitution in which the<br>
upper looper 30 and the lower looper 40 are respectively disposed below the<br>
throat plate 8, respective loop-taker points 31, 41 thereof are arranged in the<br>
same direction such that the loop-taker points 31, 41 pass a frontal side of the<br>
needle 10 as seen in the stitching direction, the upper looper 30 and the lower<br>
looper 40 are driven such that the upper looper 30 and the lower looper 40<br>
perform movements having traces on planes substantially parallel to each other,<br>
the upper looper thread 3 which is made to pass through the upper looper 30<br>
which performs the reciprocating movement drawing the arcuate trace which<br>
intersects the trace of the needle 10 above the throat plate 8 and passes through<br>
the throat plate 8 is intercepted by the needle 10 descending from the uppermost<br>
position when the upper looper 30 is descended from an uppermost position, the<br>
lower looper thread 4 which is made to pass through the lower looper 40 which<br>
performs the reciprocating movement drawing the trace L40 which intersects the<br>
trace L10 of the needle 10 and the trace L30 of the upper looper 30 below the<br>
throat plate 8 is intercepted by the descending needle 10 below the throat plate 8<br>
when the lower looper 40 is moved from one end to the other end of the trace<br>
L40, and the lower looper thread 4 is intercepted by the upper looper 30<br>
elevating from the lowermost position when the lower looper 40 is moved to the<br>
other end, whereby the upper looper thread 3 and the lower looper thread 4 are<br>
interlooped with each other at the edge portion 5c of the work 5 and, at the same<br>
time, the upper looper thread 3 is interlooped with the lockstitch portion 6<br>
through an upper surface 5a of the work 5, and the lower looper thread 4 is<br>
interlooped with the lockstitch portion 6 through a lower surface 5b of the work 5<br>
thus forming the over-edge stitch portion 7, the looper drive portion 60 can adopt<br>
any structure.<br>
Further, the cutter drive mechanism of the sewing machine of the present<br>
invention is applicable to a lockstitch sewing machine shown in Fig. 18 which is<br>
not provided with the above-mentioned looper drive mechanism 50. In this case,<br>
as shown in Fig. 19 and Fig. 20, the needle 10 through which the upper thread is<br>
made to pass performs the upward and downward movement drawing a trace<br>
L10 in the vertical direction to a throat plate 8 corresponding to the rotation of an<br>
upper shaft S1. As in the case of the conventional lockstitching, the lockstitching<br>
is performed such that the upper thread 1 which is made to pass through the<br>
needle 10 penetrates a fabric 5 following the upward and downward movement<br>
of the needle 10 and thereafter a loop-taker point 21 of a rotary hook 20<br>
intercepts an upper thread 1 at a point R when the needle 10 starts to elevate<br>
from the lowermost position along with the rotation of the lower shaft 82 which is<br>
in synchronism with the upper shaft S1 so as to make the upper thread 1 and a<br>
lower thread 2 interlace with each other, and further, the lower thread 2 is pulled<br>
up when the upper thread 1 is pulled up by the needle 10 which further returns<br>
upwardly and a looper thread take-up 730 (Fig. 11), whereby the upper thread 1<br>
and the lower thread 2 respectively form stitches 1a, 2a on an upper surface 5a<br>
and a lower surface 5b of the work, for example, the fabric 5 having a two-plied<br>
structure which are parallel to the fabric surface, and the upper thread 1 and the<br>
lower thread 2 are made to interlace each other in the vertical direction of the<br>
fabric 5, for example, at the center in the thickness-wise direction thus forming<br>
the stitch which penetrates the fabric 5 and hence, by repeating the above-<br>
mentioned operation every one stitch feed, the continuous lockstitch portion 6 is<br>
formed.<br>
Further, the cutter drive mechanism of the sewing machine of the present<br>
invention is not limited to the above-mentioned cutter drive mechanism 70 and<br>
may be a cutter drive mechanism 700 shown in Fig. 21.<br>
This cutter drive mechanism 700, as in the case of the above-mentioned<br>
cutter drive mechanism 70, cuts a fabric edge 5c of a fabric 5 (Fig. 2, Fig. 19,<br>
Fig. 20) by an upper cutter 72 which performs the upward and downward<br>
movement by way of a motion transfer mechanism 71 (Fig. 22, Fig. 11) which is<br>
operated in an interlocking manner with an upper shaft S1 and a lower cutter 73<br>
which is operated in a cooperative manner with the upper cutter 72.<br>
The cutter drive mechanism 700 of the lockstitch sewing machine is<br>
provided with a cutter drive portion 710 (Fig. 21, Fig. 22) which is supported on a<br>
frame FR and slidably guides the upper cutter 72.<br>
The motion transfer mechanism 71 is connected with the upper cutter 72<br>
by way of a clutch 750 (Fig. 22) which transmits power to the upper cutter 72 at<br>
the time of cutting operation of the cutter drive portion 710 and pivotally moves<br>
the cutter drive portion 710 to a shunting position and interrupts the transmission<br>
of the power at the time of non-cutting operation of the cutter drive portion 710.<br>
The motion transfer mechanism 71 has been explained heretofore in<br>
conjunction with Fig. 1, Fig. 10, Fig. 11 and Fig. 12 and hence, the explanation<br>
thereof is omitted here.<br>
The clutch 750 includes, as shown in Fig. 22, includes a pin 84 which is<br>
formed as a drive portion 751 on one link 82 and an elongated groove 702 which<br>
is formed in the upper cutter 72 as a driven portion 701 and into which the pin 84<br>
is fitted. The pin 84 is threadedly mounted in a mounting hole 752 (Fig. 13)<br>
formed in a lower bent end portion of the other link 82 which constitutes a drive<br>
portion 751 using a nut 753.<br>
As shown in Fig. 23, the cutter drive portion 710 includes an upper cutter<br>
drive block 711 which is provided with an elongated groove 702 (Fig. 22) into<br>
which the pin 84 of the drive portion 751 is fitted and to which the upper cutter 72<br>
is fixedly secured, a cutter slide body 712 disposed parallel with the upper cutter<br>
drive block 711, a lower cutter mounting block 713 which is disposed parallel to<br>
the cutter slide body 712 and to which the lower cutter 73 is fixedly secured, and<br>
a cutter slide shaft 714 on which these three parts are slidably fitted on in the<br>
order of the upper cutter drive block 711, the cutter slide body 712 and the lower<br>
cutter mounting block 713 from above, wherein the upper cutter 72 and the lower<br>
cutter 73 are arranged such that they can cut the fabric.<br>
The cutter slide body 712 is provided with a guide groove 712a in which a<br>
protrusion 713a formed on the lower cutter mounting block 713 is slidably fitted<br>
in the axial direction of the cutter slide shaft 714. Further, a cutter unit base 715<br>
which rotatably fixes the cutter drive portion 710 per se to the frame FR is fixedly<br>
secured the cutter slide body 712. To be more specific, on a cutter unit base<br>
mounting plate 716 which is fixedly secured to the frame FR by bolts or the like,<br>
an upper portion 715a of the cutter unit base 715 is rotatably mounted by a<br>
caulking stepped pin 717 or the like, for example. This stepped pin 717 is<br>
inserted from the cutter unit base mounting plate 716 side by way of a spring<br>
washer 722 such as wave-shaped spring washer and can control the rotation of<br>
the cutter unit base 715 when the base 715 is rotated. Further, a stopper 715b<br>
is formed on an upper end portion of the cutter unit base 715 and a protrusion<br>
716a is formed on a cutter unit base 715 mounting side of the cutter unit base<br>
mounting plate 716.<br>
Due to such a constitution, when the cutter unit base 715 is rotated from<br>
the horizontal direction which constitutes a shunting position to the vertical<br>
downward direction, the further rotation of the cutter unit base 715 is prevented.<br>
Still further, the cutter unit base 715 is bent in an L-shape such that the cutter<br>
unit base 715 can cover the cutter slide body 712 and given two neighboring<br>
surfaces of the cutter slide body 712 and the lower cutter mounting block 713.<br>
Here, the cutter slide body 712 is fixedly secured to the cutter slide shaft 714 by<br>
thread members such as small bolts.<br>
The lower cutter mounting block 713 is provided with a groove portion<br>
713b and this groove portion 713b is engaged with a locating lever 718 which is<br>
loosely fitted in a slit 715c formed in a bent portion of the cutter unit base 715<br>
which is fixedly secured to the cutter slide body 712. To be more specific, the<br>
locating lever 718 is provided with a semi-pressed protrusion 718a which<br>
constitutes a rotary shaft used as a fulcrum and the protrusion 718a is pivotally<br>
supported in a pivotally mounting hole 715d formed in the cutter unit base 715.<br>
Further, a protrusion 718b which constitutes a load point is formed on one end of<br>
the locating lever 718 and the protrusion 718b is engaged with a groove portion<br>
713b of the lower cutter mounting block 713.<br>
Accordingly, the locating lever 718 is gripped between the cutter unit base<br>
715 and the lower cutter mounting block 713 and hence, by manipulating and<br>
rotating a manipulating portion 718c which is formed at the other end of the<br>
locating lever 718 and becomes a point of force of the locating lever 718<br>
upwardly, the lower cutter mounting block 713 is descended while sliding along<br>
the cutter slide shaft 714. On the other hand, by rotating the manipulating portion<br>
718c downwardly, the lower cutter mounting block 713 is ascended or elevated<br>
while sliding along the cutter slide shaft 714. A stopper recessed portion 718c is<br>
formed on a back surface of the protruding portion 718b of the locating lever<br>
718. When the locating lever 718 is manipulated upwardly such that the lower<br>
cutter 73 is descended to a given position, a stopper protrusion 715e which is<br>
formed on the cutter unit base 715 in a protruding manner is fitted into the<br>
stopper recessed portion 718c.<br>
The lower cutter 73 fixedly secured to the lower end portion 713c of the<br>
lower cutter mounting block 713 includes, as in the case of the above-mentioned<br>
cutter drive mechanism 70, a locating locking-portion 87 which locates the cutter<br>
drive portion 710 to a locating recessed portion 86a of a locating plate 86<br>
provided to the throat plate 8 to a needle stitching position PS of the needle 10 at<br>
the time of operating cutters (Fig. 25, Fig. 26). The locating plate 86 provided<br>
with the locating recessed portion 86a is constituted such that the position of the<br>
locating plate 86 can be adjusted in the leftward and rightward direction so as to<br>
change the stitching width W to the needle stitching position PS. That is, the<br>
locating plate 86 is incorporated in the throat plate 8 such that the position of the<br>
locating plate 86 can be adjusted in the leftward and rightward direction, wherein<br>
the position of the locating plate 86 can be adjusted in the stitch width W<br>
direction to the recessed portion 8a formed in the throat plate 8. After being<br>
located, the locating plate 86 is fixedly secured to the throat plate 8 by bolts or<br>
the like.<br>
On the other hand, the upper cutter drive block 711 includes a groove<br>
portion 711a and an upper cutter spring plate 719 is fitted in the groove portion<br>
711a and is fixedly secured thereto by threaded members 720 such as bolts.<br>
This upper cutter spring plate 719 is formed to have a length which allows the<br>
upper cutter spring plate 719 extended from the upper cutter drive block 711 and<br>
is slidably and loosely fitted in a guide groove 712a formed in the cutter slide<br>
body 712. Using threaded members 721 such as bolts, the upper cutter 72 is<br>
fixedly secured to a portion 719a of the upper cutter spring plate 719 extended<br>
from the upper cutter drive block 711. The extended portion 719a of the upper<br>
cutter spring plate 719 is bent so as to make the upper cutter 72 press the lower<br>
cutter 73 by positively applying a biasing force of the upper cutter spring plate<br>
719.<br>
In the lockstitch sewing machine having such a constitution, at the<br>
time of performing the over-edge stitching in the lockstitching by cutting<br>
the fabric edge, as shown in Fig. 24(a), when the locating lever 718 of the<br>
cutter drive portion 710 is descended to a given position and the lower<br>
cutter 73 takes a non-operable state in which the lower cutter 73 is shunted<br>
in the shunting position by the lower cutter mounting block 713, the locating<br>
lever 718 is manipulated upwardly as shown in Fig. 24(b). Due to such a<br>
manipulation, the lower cutter 73 which is fixedly secured to the lower cutter<br>
mounting block 713 having the groove portion 713b in which the protrusion<br>
718b of the locating lever 718 is fitted is descended so that the locating locking<br>
portion 87 of the lower cutter 73 is fitted in the locating recessed portion 86a of<br>
the locating plate 86 provided to the throat plate 8 so that the cutter operable<br>
state (Fig. 25) in which the cutter drive portion 710 is located to the needle<br>
stitching position PS of the needle 10 can be established. Here, since the<br>
stopper protruding portion 715e formed on the cutter unit base 715 in a<br>
protruding manner is replaceably fitted in the stopper recessed portion 718c<br>
formed in the locating lever 718 by a given force, the return of the locating lever<br>
718 can be prevented.<br>
In this cutter operable state, as shown in Fig. 19 and Fig. 20, the needle<br>
10 through which the upper thread 1 is made to pass performs the upward and<br>
downward movement drawing the trace L10 in the vertical direction to the throat<br>
plate 8 along with the rotation of the upper shaft S1. In the lockstitching, in the<br>
same manner as the conventional lockstitching, the upper thread 1 which is<br>
made to pass through the needle 10 penetrates a fabric 5 following the upward<br>
and downward movement of the needle 10 and thereafter a loop-taker point 21<br>
of a rotary hook 20 intercepts an upper thread 1 along with the rotation of the<br>
lower shaft S2 which is in synchronism with the upper shaft S1 at a point R when<br>
the needle 10 starts to elevate from the lowermost position so as to make the<br>
upper thread 1 and a lower thread 2 interlace with each other, and further, the<br>
lower thread 2 is pulled up when the upper thread 1 is pulled up by the needle 10<br>
which further returns upwardly and a looper thread take-up 730 (Fig. 11),<br>
whereby the upper thread 1 and the lower thread 2 respectively form stitches 1 a,<br>
2a on an upper surface 5a and a lower surface 5b of the work, for example, the<br>
fabric 5 having a two-plied structure which are parallel to the fabric surface, and<br>
the upper thread 1 and the lower thread 2 are made to interlace each other in the<br>
vertical direction of the fabric 5, for example, at the center in the thickness-wise<br>
direction thus forming the stitch which penetrates the fabric 5 and hence.by<br>
repeating the above-mentioned operation everyone stitch feed, the continuous<br>
lockstitch is formed.<br>
Further, the rotational movement of the rotary shaft of the sewing<br>
machine, for example, the upper shaft S1 in the drawing is transferred into<br>
upward and downward movement by way of the motion transfer mechanism 71<br>
(Fig. 21, Fig. 22, Fig. 11 and Fig. 12) which is operated in an interlocking manner<br>
with the above-mentioned rotational movement. That is, when the upper shaft<br>
S1 is rotated, the first quadric crank chain LK1 is rocked wherein the links 77, 78<br>
are used as cranks and the link 80 is used as a connecting rod and the link 79 is<br>
used as a rocker arm. By the rocking of the link 79, the link 81 of the second<br>
quadric crank chain LK2 is rocked and the link 82 and accordingly the drive<br>
portion 751 of the clutch 75 performs the upward and downward movement.<br>
Here, the motion trace of the link 82 draws an elliptical trace due to the quadric<br>
crank chain mechanisms LK1, LK2 and draws an approximate straight line in the<br>
vertical direction at a PL point in the vicinity of the drive portion 751 so that the<br>
reaction from the cutter drive portion 74 is supported by a guide pin 754 held at<br>
the PL point of the link 82 which passes through an elongated guide hole 755a<br>
formed in the guide plate 755 fixedly secured to the frame FR. Due to such a<br>
constitution, the motion of the drive portion 751 in the lateral direction is<br>
restricted and only the upward and downward motion can obtain a stroke t (Fig.<br>
11) per one rotation of the upper shaft S1.<br>
The upward and downward motion obtained by the motion transfer<br>
mechanism 71 is transmitted to the upper cutter 72 by way of the pin 84 of the<br>
drive portion 751 of the clutch 750 and the elongated groove 702 in which the pin<br>
84 of the upper cutter drive block 711 of the cutter drive portion 710 which<br>
constitutes the driven portion 701 is fitted. In the cutter operable state (Fig. 25)<br>
in which the locating locking portion 87 of the lower cutter 73 is fitted into the<br>
locating recessed portion of the locating plate 86 provided to the throat plate 8<br>
so that the cutter drive portion 710 is located to the needle stitching position PS<br>
of the needle 10, the upper cutter 72 is slidably guided by the guide groove 712a<br>
of the cutter slide body 712 by way of the upper cutter spring plate 719 using the<br>
upper cutter drive block 711 of the cutter drive portion 710 which is pivotally<br>
mounted on the frame FR.<br>
In this cutter operable state, the cutter drive portion 710 is held in the<br>
vertical state around the stepped pin 16 and the longitudinal direction of the<br>
elongated hole 702 is directed in the horizontal direction, the pin 84 of the drive<br>
portion 751 of the clutch 750 and the elongated groove 702 of the driven portion<br>
701 allow the power transmission and hence, the power is transmitted to the<br>
upper cutter 72 at the time of performing the operation 710. Accordingly, the<br>
fabric edge 5c of the fabric 5 is cut by the upper cutter 72 which performs the<br>
upward and the downward movement and the lower cutter 73 which is<br>
cooperatively operated with the upper cutter 72.<br>
In this manner, by performing the zigzag stitching or the like while cutting<br>
the fabric edge 5c of the fabric 5, it becomes possible to perform the over-edge<br>
stitching simultaneously with the lockstitching.<br>
Here, in the cutter non-operable state in which only the lockstitching is<br>
desired without cutting the fabric edge 5c of the fabric 5, as shown in Fig. 24 (a)<br>
and Fig. 26, the locating lever 718 is manipulated downwardly. Accordingly, the<br>
state that the lower cutter 73 fixedly secured to the lower cutter mounting block<br>
713 is elevated and the locating locking portion 87 of the lower cutter 73 is fitted<br>
in the locating recessed portion 86a of the locating plate 86 provided to the<br>
throat plate 8 is released. By pivotally moving the cutter drive portion 710 about<br>
the stepped pin 717 to the shunting position in the horizontal state by<br>
manipulating the same locating lever 718, the longitudinal direction of the<br>
elongated groove 702 is directed in the vertical direction and hence, the pin 84 of<br>
the drive portion 751 of the clutch 750 only moves in the elongated hole 702 of<br>
the driven portion 701 with a play and the transmission of power to the upper<br>
cutter 72 is interrupted. Further, when the cutter drive portion 710 is pivotally<br>
moved, a screw 723 having a pan-shaped head which fixedly secures the cutter<br>
slide body 712 to the cutter unit base 715 impinges on the cutter unit base<br>
mounting plate 716, and the cutter unit base 715 is inclined by the attenuating<br>
function of a spring washer 722 for braking and gets over the cutter unit base<br>
mounting plate 716 and then is fitted into a recessed portion 716b formed in the<br>
cutter unit base mounting plate 716. Accordingly, the cutter drive portion 710 is<br>
semi-fixedly secured and hence, it becomes possible to prevent the downward<br>
displacement of the cutter drive portion 710 due to the vibration or the like<br>
generated by the sewing machine. In this manner, with the simple manipulation<br>
of the locating lever 718 which is required only to pivotally move the cutter drive<br>
portion 710 from the cutter operable position in the vertical state to the cutter<br>
shunting position in the horizontal state, the operation can be changed over to an<br>
operation to perform only the lockstitching without cutting the fabric edge 5c of<br>
the fabric 5.<br>
The cutter drive portion of the cutter drive mechanism of the sewing<br>
machine according to the present invention is not limited to the above structure<br>
and any structure can be used so long as the structure allows the slidable<br>
mounting of the lower cutter and is provided with a locating lever which fits the<br>
locating locking portion into the locating recessed portion of the throat plate at<br>
the time of performing the cutting operation.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
As has been explained heretofore, in the looper drive mechanism of the<br>
sewing machine disclosed herein, the upper looper and the lower looper are<br>
respectively disposed below the throat plate, respective loop-taker points thereof<br>
are arranged in the same direction such that the loop-taker points pass a frontal<br>
side of the needle as seen in the stitching direction, the upper looper and the<br>
lower looper can be driven such that the upper looper and the lower looper<br>
perform movements having traces on planes substantially parallel to each other,<br>
whereby the looper drive mechanism has both of the lockstitching function and<br>
the over-edge stitching function. Further, it becomes possible to firmly stitch a<br>
plurality of fabrics and to simultaneously perform the over-edge stitching of edge<br>
portions of these fabrics. Still further, the labor and cost incurred by the stitching<br>
can be minimized.<br>
In the looper drive mechanism of the sewing machine, the lockstitch and<br>
the over-edge stitch can be individually formed with the use of a needle and two<br>
loopers and hence, the stitch of the present invention can be realized easily and<br>
at a low cost with a single sewing machine. Further, in this case, the alteration of<br>
stitch from such a stitch to other stitch can be easily performed with an extremely<br>
small change.<br>
Further, the clutch can be changed over such that the clutch forms the<br>
lockstitch portion and the over-edge portion by transmitting power from the lower<br>
shaft to the looper drive shaft at the time of forming the over-edge portion and<br>
forms the lockstitch portion by shunting the upper looper at the lowermost<br>
position and interrupting the transmission of power from the lower shaft to the<br>
looper drive shaft at the time of forming the lockstitch portion. Accordingly, the<br>
labor and time necessary for individually performing the lockstitching and the<br>
over-edge stitching can be saved.<br>
Still further, in the cutter drive mechanism of the sewing machine of the<br>
present invention, the cutter cutting mechanism portion can be incorporated into<br>
the existing space of the sewing machine and hence, it become possible to<br>
perform such stitching by changing over an operation which performs the over-<br>
edge stitching in the lockstitching by cutting the fabric edge and an operation<br>
which performs the lockstitching without cutting the fabric edge.<br>
