				<td>Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a method of controlling air conditioner for vehicles, and more specifically to a method of controlling air conditioner for vehicles, wherein the target control value of the pressure control valve which controls tilt angle of a swash-plate of a swash-plate type variable capacity compressor is variably controlled according to the temperature deviation between target evaporator temperature and actual evaporator temperature, thereby efficiently controlling the discharge capacity of the compressor.<br>
Background Art<br>
In a typical swash-plate type variable capacity compressor, the tilt angle of a swash-plate can be controlled by the change in the pressure of the refrigerant which is controlled by the pressure control valve depending on the thermal load. By controlling the tilt angle of a swash-plate, the stroke distance of the piston is changed thereby changing the discharge capacity of refrigerant and thus controlling the temperature of an evaporator.<br>
The pressure control valve can be either internal-controlling type or external-controlling type, and a typical structure of swash-plate type variable capacity compressor is disclosed in Japanese laid open patent application No. 2001-107854.<br>
In vehicles having an air conditioner equipped with the swash-plate type variable capacity compressor as described above, the air conditioner should operates properly at the initial stage of the operation depending on the deviation between the target evaporator temperature and an actual evaporator temperature. For example, the discharge capacity of the compressor should be controlled so that the evaporator temperature reaches the target temperature keeping passengers from being in discomfort and preventing the occurrence of large noise.<br>
Japanese laid open patent application No. 2003-200730 discloses a method of controlling air conditioner wherein proportional-integral control is carried out on the discharge capacity of the compressor by setting the control value(duty) of the pressure control valve<br><br>
depending on the deviation between the target evaporator temperature and actual evaporator temperature.<br>
This technique has an advantage of making evaporator temperature drop down quickly. However, when the initial current value of the pressure control valve and the actual evaporator temperature are higher than the target temperature, considering the actual evaporator temperature is high at the initial stage of operation, the control current value of the pressure control valve should be further increased in order to fully decrease the actual evaporator temperature. Thus, excessive undershoot on the evaporator temperature may occur and it takes a considerable time for the current to become decreased and convergent to stabilization.<br>
Japanese laid open patent application No. 2002-327686 discloses a method in which the capacity of the pressure control valve becomes increasingly larger from its minimum value<br>
during operation of the air conditioner.<br>
In this method, the discharge capacity of the compressor is slowly increased from its minimum value preventing operation shock and making passenger comfortable and improving the problem of noise. This method, however, has a problem of making the time for stabilization to reach the target evaporator temperature longer.<br>
Also, the prior art methods described above can cause a problem of deteriorating convergence to reach the target evaporator temperature and thus causes instability since the capacity of the pressure control valve is fixedly controlled regardless of the variable need for high thermal load control or low thermal load control on the compressor.<br>

Mode for Invention<br>
The features and advantages of the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the attached drawings in order to specifically clarify the invention. It should be appreciated that the terms and expressions used in the specification and drawing should be interpreted to comply with the technical ideas of the present invention under the principle that inventors can properly define concepts of terms to explain his invention best.<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates one example of a swash-plate type variable capacity compressor 100.<br>
The swash-plate type variable capacity compressor 100, as illustrated in Fig. 1, comprises: a cylinder block 110 in which a plurality of cylinder bores 112 are formed in the radial direction along the coaxial circle; a plurality of pistons 114 inserted between the cylinder block 110 and cylinder bores 112; a front housing 120 which is connected to the front side of the cylinder block 110 and which forms a crank chamber 122 in it; a rear housing 130 which is connected to the rear side of the cylinder block 110 and which forms a refrigerant suction chamber 132 and refrigerant discharging chamber 134 in it; a driving shaft 140 supported across the cylinder block 110; a rotor 142 which rotates with the driving shaft 140 in the crank chamber 122; a swash-plate 144 which is movably installed around the driving shaft 140 and connected in the edge to the piston 114 in order to move the piston 114 in forward and backward direction and hinge-connected in one side of the edge to the rotor 142; a valve unit 150 which is interpositioned between the cylinder block 110 and rear housing 130 and which suctions refrigerant from the refrigerant suction chamber 132 to the cylinder bore 112 and discharges compressed refrigerant from the cylinder bores<br><br>
112 to the refrigerant discharging chamber 134; a externally controlled pressure control valve 160 which is installed on the rear housing 130 in order to control the tilt angle of the swash-plate 144 against the driving shaft 140 by controlling the opening rate of the refrigerant returning passage connecting the refrigerant discharging' chamber 134 to the crank chamber 122.<br>
In the swash-plate type variable capacity compressor 100 as described above, a plurality of pistons 114 move in forward and backward direction sequentially by the wobbling rotation of the swash-plate 144. When the piston 114 moves backward from the cylinder bore 112 (suction stroke), suction side of the valve unit 150 is opened due to the decrease in pressure in the cylinder bore 112 which connects the cylinder bore 112 to the suction chamber and, thus, refrigerant is suctioned from the suction chamber to the cylinder bore 112. When the piston 114 moves forward to the cylinder bore 112 (compression stroke), the refrigerant suctioned to the cylinder bore 112 is compressed due to the increase in pressure in the cylinder bore 112 and discharging side of the valve unit 150 is opened to connect the cylinder bore 112 to the refrigerant discharging chamber 134, and, thus, the compressed refrigerant is discharged from the cylinder bore 112 to the refrigerant discharge chamber 134. The pressure control valve 160 controls the tilt angle of the swash-plate 144 by controlling the opening rate of the refrigerant returning passage connecting the refrigerant discharge chamber 134 to the crank chamber 122 according to the magnitude of thermal load and, thus, controls the discharge capacity of the refrigerant. As the tilting angle of the swash-plate 144 against the driving shaft 140 becomes acute, the discharge capacity of the refrigerant increases due to the increase of the stroke distance of the piston 114.<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates an air conditioner for vehicles equipped with the swash-plate type variable capacity compressor 100 as described above.<br>
The air conditioner, as illustrated in Fig. 2, comprises an air conditioner case 210, a blower 220 installed on the entrance of the air conditioner case 210, an evaporator 200 and heater core 230 built in the air conditioner case 210, a temperature control door 240 which controls the opening rate of the passage of cooled and heated air passing through the evaporator 200, a swash-plate type variable capacity compressor 100 which suctions refrigerant from the evaporator 200 and discharges it, a condenser 170 which condenses<br><br>
and discharges the refrigerant supplied from the compressor 100, a receiver dryer 180 which separates the refrigerant supplied from the condenser 170 into gas and liquid, an expansion valve 190 which throttles the refrigerant supplied from the receiver dryer 180 and sends the refrigerant to the evaporator 200. The reference numeral 212, 214, 216 represents each valve, and 212d, 214d, 216d represents control door which controls corresponding vent 212, 214,216.<br>
The electronic clutch 146 which transfers the power of the engine to the compressor 100, the pressure control valve 160 which controls the discharge capacity of the compressor by controlling tilt angle of the swash-plate 144 and the actuator 310 which controls opening rate of the temperature control door 240 are controlled by the control unit 300. More specifically, the control unit 300 supplies or cuts power to the electronic clutch 146, controls the output current value on the actuator 310 so that the temperature control door 240 turns to open the air passage toward the heater core 230 or to detour the passage, and controls the output current value to the pressure control valve 160 in order to change the tilt angle of the swash-plate 144 so that the discharge capacity of the refrigerant increases or decreases.<br>
In Fig. 2, unexplained numeral 320 represents an evaporator temperature sensor, 330 an exterior temperature sensor, 340 an interior temperature sensor, 350 a solar radiation sensor and 360 a cooling water temperature sensor, and the signals detected by these sensors are input to the control unit 300.<br>
In the following, the method of controlling air conditioner for vehicles according to the present invention is described.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, when air conditioner is ON (S100), various signals detected by the evaporator temperature sensor 320, the exterior temperature sensor 330, the interior temperature sensor 340, the solar radiation sensor 350 and the cooling water temperature sensor 360 are input to the control unit 300 (SI00).<br>
Then target heat discharge quantity of the vent is calculated by the control unit 300 (SI 10).<br>
The target heat discharge quantity of the vent can be calculated by using the target interior temperature input by the user, interior and exterior temperature of the vehicle and solar<br><br>
radiation detected by the sensors 330, 340, 350 installed on the predetermined positions of the vehicle.<br>
Then, target evaporator temperature is calculated by the control unit 300 (S120).<br>
The target evaporator temperature can be set as shown in Fig. 4: the target interior temperature is set by the user (S121). Next, interior and exterior temperature of the vehicle and solar radiation are detected by using sensors 330, 340, 350 installed on the predetermined positions of the vehicle and input to the control unit 300 (S122). Then, a target discharge temperature of the vents 212, 214, 216 is calculated by using the target interior temperature, interior and exterior temperature of the vehicle and solar radiation (S124). Then, maximum evaporator temperature is input (SI25). Then, target evaporator temperature is set (SI 27) by comparing the target discharge temperature of the vents 212, 214,216 with the maximum evaporator temperature (S126).<br>
In the step of inputting the maximum evaporator temperature, it is preferable to calculate and input the maximum evaporator temperature depending on the temperature of the air flowed into the evaporator at the minimum operation of the compressor.<br>
In the step of comparing the target discharge temperature with the maximum evaporator temperature, it is preferable to set the target evaporator temperature to the target discharge temperature when the target discharge temperature is lower than the maximum evaporator temperature, and set the target evaporator temperature to the maximum evaporator temperature when the target discharge temperature is higher than the maximum evaporator temperature.<br>
The step of calculating the target heat discharge quantity of the vents 212, 214,216 can be further added after the step of detecting and inputting interior and exterior temperature of the vehicle and solar radiation by using sensors 330, 340, 350 installed on the predetermined positions of the vehicle (SI22), then target discharge temperature of the vent 212, 214, 216 can be calculated (SI24) by the target heat discharge quantity of the of the vents.<br>
After calculating the target evaporator temperature, determination on the high thermal load control or low thermal load control is made from the target heat discharge quantity (S130).<br><br>
The determination can be made based on appropriate standards. For example, high thermal load control can be selected when exterior temperature is higher man 30<br>
According to the present invention, compulsive control of the control value on the pressure control valve 160 is made according to the amount of the thermal load firstly, and then normal control of the control value is carried out secondly. The detailed procedure is as follows.<br>
In the case of high thermal load control, the control value on the pressure control valve 160 is set to a maximum value initially (SI40) and decreased with constant rate thereafter (SI60) in the compulsive control mode, as shown in Figs 3 and 5.<br>
The maximum value is, for example, 100 to 70%, and more preferably, 90 to 80%.<br>
In addition, in the process of high thermal load control, determination is made on whether the deviation between the target evaporator temperature and actual evaporator temperature is not larger than predetermined value (SI50). When the deviation between the target evaporator temperature and actual evaporator temperature is not larger than predetermined temperature value (for example 5D) after the control value is kept at maximum value, it is desirable to decrease the control value with a constant rate.<br>
The time of changing to the normal control mode from the compulsive control mode is preferably when the absolute value of the deviation between the actual evaporator temperature (Tn) and previous actual evaporator temperature (Tn-1) of with predetermined time interval (At, for example 2.7seconds) is not larger than a predetermined value (for example 0.3).<br>
Also, the normal control mode is preferably proportional-integral (PI) control or proportional-integral-differential (PID) control.<br>
The target evaporator temperature and an actual evaporator temperature may mean either the temperature of the air discharged through the evaporator or the temperature of the evaporator itself, and each can be selected as needed.<br>
The reason that the control value on the pressure control valve 160 is kept at maximum<br><br>
value firstly and decreased with a constant rate with compulsive control mode in the process of high thermal load control, and thereafter normal control mode is carried out under the state where the actual evaporator temperature is lower than the target evaporator temperature is that the actual evaporator temperature needs to reach' the target evaporator temperature quickly considering cooling efficiency. When the time of starting the normal control mode is set when the actual evaporator temperature is higher than the target evaporator temperature in the process of high thermal load control, passengers can feel uncomfortable and it takes longer time for the actual evaporator temperature to reach the target evaporator temperature.<br>
Meanwhile, in the case of low thermal load control, the control value on the pressure control valve 160 is set to a minimum value and maintained at this value compulsively for a predetermined time in the compulsive control mode (S200), and then normal control mode is carried out by variably setting control coefficients according to the amount of thermal load (SI80). The normal control mode is preferably carried out so that undershoot does not occur.<br>
The time for maintaining the control value to the minimum value is preferably less than 1 minute. Also, the minimum value can be set to 0 to 40%, and more preferably, 30 to 40%.<br>
In low thermal load control, additionally, the temperature of the cooling water can be measured further by cooling water sensor 360 in order to determine whether the cooling water temperature is not higher than a predetermined temperature (S210). When the temperature of the cooling water is not higher than the predetermined temperature, the opening rate of the temperature control door 240 is set to a maximum heating position (the position which closes the heating air passage) as shown in Fig. 2. In this way, the decrease in the temperature of the air due to the low cooling water temperature is prevented. When the temperature of the cooling water becomes higher than the predetermined temperature, the temperature control door 240 is set to a normal position.<br>
By carrying out the low thermal load control as described above, the actual evaporator temperature needs to reach the target evaporator temperature stably without fluctuation. This can be carried out more efficiently through the control of the opening rate of the temperature control door 240.<br><br>
Also, the normal control mode in the low thermal load control is preferably proportional-integral (PI) control or proportional-integral-differential (PDD) control.<br>
In the high low thermal load control and low thermal load control as described above, the control value which varies variably depending on the amount of thermal load in the normal control mode is preferably proportional gain, integral gain or differential gain according to the type of the control. The control coefficients are preferably set to have a value proportional to the absolute value of the deviation between the target evaporator temperature and actual evaporator temperature, and is set to a maximum value when the absolute value of said temperature deviation is larger than a predetermined value.<br>

12.	The method of controlling air conditioner for vehicles according to claim 1, wherein in the case of low thermal load control, the method includes the steps of setting said control value to a minimum value, measuring the temperature of the cooling water, determining whether the temperature of the cooling water is not higher than predetermined temperature, and when the temperature of the cooling water is not higher than predetermined temperature, the opening rate of the temperature control door is set to a maximum heating position.<br>
13.	A method of controlling air conditioner for vehicles substantially as hereinbefore described particularly with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br><br>
The present invention is about a method of controlling air conditioner for vehicles. There was a problem of deteriorating convergence to reach the target evaporator temperature. That causes instability since the capacity of the pressure control valve is fixedly controlled regardless of the variable need for high thermal load control or low thermal load control on the compressor.<br>
For solving the above problems, the present invention comprises the steps of calculating a target heat discharge quantity, calculating a target evaporator temperature, determining on the high thermal load control or low thermal load control from the calculated target heat discharge quantity and compulsively controlling the control value of the pressure control valve of variable capacity compressor according to the amount of the thermal load firstly in a compulsive control mode and then normally controlling the control value secondly in a normal control mode.</description></td>
