Detailed Description of the Drawings<br>
Figure 1 is a view showing a seat 10 in an upright position with a passenger seated in the seat 10.<br>
Figure 2 is a view of the same seat 10 shown in Figure 1 with one leg of the passenger resting on a side ottoman. In an aircraft cabin a number of these seats are arranged one in front of another and are fixed to suitable supports such as rails or the like (not shown) to secure the seats in place.<br>
7<br><br>
As shown in Figures 1 and 2 the seat has a shell 12 formed from any suitable rigid material such as aluminium./ rigid plastic material or the like.  The shell 12 supports a seat base 14 and the backrest 16.<br>
The shell 12 has a side shell 20 which supports a side ottoman 22.  The side shell 20 typically extends adjacent the side wall of the aircraft cabin.<br>
The shell 12 has first and second side portions 23 and 24 and first and second rear side portions 25 and 26. The rear sections 25 and 26 are higher than the front sections 23 and 24.  The shell 12 also has a rear panel 27.<br>
The seat 10 will be provided with a safety belt as  is conventional, which is not shown in the drawings.  A separate set of safety belts can be provided for the seat when in the bed configuration.<br>
Figure 3 is a view of the seat 10 in a bed configuration.  In the configuration shown in Figure 3 the backrest 16 has been pivoted dovna to a flat position so that rear surface 17 is uppermost.  Movement of the backrest to the position shown in Figure 3 exposes a rear seat portion 30 located behind the backrest 16 when in the upright position, and which is generally defined by the back panel 27 and the side sections 25 and 26. The rear seat section 30 has an open space 32 which has a base 34, and the first part 31 of a footwell cavity 32.  The footwell part 31 is a box section formed from an upright panel 33, an inclined top panel 35, and a small front surface 36.  A second part 36 of the footwell 32 is an extension of the part 31 defined within the shell 12 beside wall 26.<br>
8<br><br>
The side ottoman 22 has a shelf 39 which can be used, both when the seat is in the seating configuration shown in Figures 1 and 2 and the bed configuration shovm in Figure 3.  The ottoman 22 has an ottoman surface 40 and a front portion 42 which is a continuation of the surface 40.  The front portion 42 is located in front of the backrest 16 when the backrest in the position shovm in Figure 3.<br>
An extension piece 41 is pivotally connected to the backrest 16 and can pivot from a position overlapping the backrest 16 to the position shovm in Figure 3 to occupy the space between the rear surface 17 of the backrest and the front portion 42 of the ottoman.  The line 45 shovm in Figure 3 generally shows the position of the rear panel 27' (Fig 6) of another seat 10' (Fig 6) in front of the seat shovm in Figure 3.<br>
The front portion of the ottoman 42 extends into the footwell 32' of the seat 10' in front of the seat 10 shovm in Figure 3 as is best shovm in Figure 4.<br>
In Figure 4 the front seat 10' located in front of the seat 10 show3 the cavity which forms the footwell 32' into which the front portion 42 extends.<br>
When the seat is in the bed configuration shown in Figure 3 the base 34 of the open space 32, the rear surface 17 of the backrest 16, the extension piece 41 and the front portion 42 of the ottoman 22 form a flat surface which forms a bed.<br>
The preferred embodiment of the invention includes the side ottoman 22 as part of the available bed surface when the seat is in the bed configuration.  The height<br>
9<br><br>
of the ottoman 22 is designed to match the height of the other bed components (i.e. rear surface 17) when the seat is in the bed configuration.<br>
The base 34, rear surface 17 and extension piece 42 can be covered by a comfortable foam material or the like as is the ottoman surface 40 and front portion 42.<br>
Figure 5 is a plan view of two seats 10 and 10' with the seat 10 in the bed configuration.  As is apparent from Figure 5 a person's head can locate in the open space 32 resting on the base 34 (or on a pillow or other comfortable head support located on the base 34) and the person can lay diagonally across the rear surface 17 of the backrest 16 with the person's feet locating on the front portion 42 of the ottoman 22 within the footwell 32' of the front seat 10'.<br>
A side view of the two seats is shown in Figure 5.  In Figure 6 a pivotal coupling 51 can be seen which enables the backrest 16 to move from the upright position to the flat position as shown by dotted line A, and also the pivotal coupling 52 which enables the extension piece 41 to move from the folded position against the rear surface 17 of the backrest 16 into positions shown in Figure 6 as illustrated by the dotted line B in Figure 6.  It is also apparent from Figure 6 that the front portion 42 of the side ottoman 22 extends into the footwell 31' of the front seat 10'.  Figure 6 also shows the supporting structure 52 which supports the seat in the aircraft cabin. The supporting structure 52 is conventional and therefore will not be described in any further detail.  Figure 6 also shows seat mechanism 53 for enabling the seat to be adjusted between a fully upright position shown in Figures 1 and 2 and into a<br>
JO<br><br>
reclined position in which the seat base 14 moves slightly forward causing the backrest 16 to take up a more inclined upright position.  Again the mechanism 53 is conventional and therefore will not be described in further detail.<br>
Figure 7 is a plan view of two seats according to the abovementioned International application with the rear seat in the bed configuration.  As can be seen from Figure 7 the width of the actual seat portion itself is 38 inches with the overall width of the seating configuration being 46 inches.  The length of the bed is generally illustrated by double-headed arrow C in Figure 7.<br>
Figure 8 shows the rear seat 10 of the preferred embodiment of the invention in the bed configuration, with the front seat 10' in the normal upright configuration.  As is apparent from Figure 8 the width of the seat is reduced to about 30 inches whilst the overall width of the configuration remains the same. However, the length of the bed is increased as shown by arrow D.  Arrow C is also shown in Figure 8 for comparison purposes.  Thus, the bed configuration is larger without sacrificing the overall width of the seat configuration shown in Figures 7 and 8 or the overall length of the seat configuration.  Thus, a larger bed length is achieved for the same pitch of seating within the aircraft cabin.<br>
The rear of the panel 27 may be provided with a television screen for the person behind that seat or with other items such as a foldable shelf etc.<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the invention the shell 12 can be formed in a number of parts such as a first<br>
11<br><br>
part containing the sides 23 and 24 and the lower part of the footwell part 31 and the rear sections 25 and 26. The upper part of the rear panel 30 together with the upper part of the footwell 31 can be formed as a second part and joined to the first part along, for example, line 70 shown in Figure 3.<br>
When the seat 16 is in the upright position the rear of the seat 17 can rest against the front wall 36 for support.  The seat may also lock in the upright position as is conventional until it is adjusted to move into the flat position shown in Figure 3 by means of a release mechanism 72 shown in Figure 3 which can be manoeuvred to allow the seat to fold into the flat position shown in Figure 3 and used as a handle to return the seat to the upright position.<br>
In the claims which follow and in the preceding description of the invention, except where the context requires otherwise due to express language or necessary implication, the word "comprise" or variations such as "comprises" or "comprising" is used in an inclusive sense, i.e. to specify the presence of the stated features but not to preclude the presence or addition of further features in various embodiments of the invention.<br>
Since modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention may readily be effected by persons skilled within the art, it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to the particular embodiment described by way of example hereinabove.<br>
