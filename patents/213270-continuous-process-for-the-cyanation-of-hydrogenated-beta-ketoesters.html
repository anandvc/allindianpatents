The present invention relates to a continuous process for the cyanation of hydrogenated p-ketoesters.<br>
Cyanated, hydrogenated p-ketoesters are useful as pharmaceutical intermediates. One particularly useful intermediate is (R)-ethyl-4-cyano-3-hydroxybutyric acid ester of the formula (1)<br>
which is used in the preparation of hypolipidemic agents. There have been a number of<br>
reports of the preparation of this compound,and of compounds of this type. For example, JP-A-2001114739 discloses a method for producing lower alkyl esters of (R)-4-cyano-3-hydroxybutyric acid from lower alkyl esters of (S)-4-halogen-3-hydroxybutyric acid by means of a cyanation reaction which comprises carrying out a distillation after filtering an organic solvent phase obtained by extracting and separating the lower alkyl ester of the (R)-4-cyano-3-hydroxybutyric acid from a reaction liquid after cyanation.<br>
JP-A-19970254804 discloses a method for purifying a crude (R)-4-cyano-3 hydroxybutyric acid lower alkyl ester, formed from the cyanation of an (S)-4-chloro-3-hydroxybutyric acid lower alkyl ester by distillation in the presence of a solvent. Japanese Patent No. 2001302607 discloses a process for the cyanation of a halogenohydroxybutyrate at from 90°C to 120°C in an organic solvent or mixed aqueous organic solvent.<br>
JP - A -19990018144 discloses a method for producing a lower alkyl ester of (R)-4-cyano-3-hydroxybutyric acid comprising carrying out a cyanation reaction on an (S)-4-halogeno-3-hydroxybutyric acid and then adding an acid and regulating the pH of the<br><br>

WO-A-OO/46186 discloses a process for preparing (R)-4-cyano-3-hydroxybutyric acid ester derivatives by cyanation and sequential esterification (S)-3,4-epoxybutyric acid salt as a starting material.<br>

The process of the invention will now be more particularly described with reference to the following drawing, in which:<br>
Figure 1 represent a schematic diagram of a plan contrated and arranged to oprate in<br><br>
accordance with the process of the invention.<br>
Referring to Figure 1, there is shown a cyanation zone 1 which is heated by means of a heat exchanger 2. In this example, cyanation zone 1 is maintained at temperature from about 90°C to about 120°C. A substrate comprising, in this example, (S)-ethyl 4-chloro-3-hydroxybutyrate in water is supplied via lines 3, 4 and 5 to cyanation zone 1. Sodium cyanide is supplied in line 6 and passes through lines 4 and 5 into cyanation zone 1. Preferably an acidic material such as acetic acid is added in line 6a. The cyanation reaction takes place inside cyanation zone 1 and a product stream comprising R-ethyl-4-cyano-3-hydroxybutyrate is extracted in line 7 after a suitable residence time. Suitable residence times in the reactor may be from about 5 seconds to about 300 seconds, more preferably from about 20 seconds to about 80 seconds. The product stream is quenched by an acid supplied in line 8.<br>
It will be appreciated that the configuration of plant, pipework, control valves, pumps, release valves, flow controllers and other items of standard equipment shown are illustrated by way of example only and that the process of the invention is not limited to the schematic configuration of plant shown in Figure 1.<br>
The plant illustrated in Figure 1 is used in a continuous cyanation process as described in the following Examples.<br>
Example 1<br>
A first feed tank was charged with a 14.7% (w/w) aqueous solution of sodium cyanide. A second feed tank was charged with (S)-ethyl-4-chloro-3-hydroxybutyrate. Both tanks were connected by tubing to a reactor which was heated to 105°C and maintained at atmospheric pressure. The sodium cyanide solution was continuously fed into the reactor at a flow rate of 0.14 ml/minute by means of a pump. The (S)-ethyl-4-chloro-3-hydroxybutyrate was continuously fed into the reactor at a flow rate of 0.80 ml/minute by means of a pump. At these flow rates the residence time in the reactor of the combined reaction product mixture was 48 seconds. The crude product stream exiting the reactor<br><br>
was continuously quenched by the addition of a solution comprising 6.9% (w/w) glacial acetic acid in ethyl acetate at a flow rate of 0.94 ml/minute. Product isolation was achieved by separating the ethyl acetate phase followed by evaporation at ~ 30 mbar and ~ 60°C. The active yield of (R)-ethyl-4-cyano-3-hydroxybutyrate was 67.4%.<br>
Example 2<br>
A first feed tank was charged with a 15% (w/w) aqueous solution of sodium cyanide. A second feed tank was charged with an 80% w/w aqueous solution of acetic acid. A third feed tank was charged with (S)-ethyl-4-chloro-3-hydroxybutyrate. The sodium cyanide and acetic acid solutions were mixed at a molar ratio of 21: 1 using a plug flow reactor element with a 1.4-second residence time at ambient temperature. The mixture was continuously fed into a two-stage plug flow reactor element into which (S)-ethyl-4-chloro-3-hydroxybutyrate was continuously fed such that the molar ratio of cyanide to substrate was 2: 1. The two stage reactor element consisted of an initial pre-mixer with a 4.5 second residence time and a secondary mixer with a 72 second residence time, both mixing elements being contained within a heat transfer medium such that the reaction temperature was maintained at between 105°C and 110°C. The mixture was then continuously quenched using additional 80% acetic acid in a plug flow reactor element with a residence time of 4.0 seconds at ambient temperature. The quench acid flow rate was adjusted to maintain the crude product flow stream at a pH of between 5.0 and 5.5. The crude product was obtained as an aqueous solution, which was subjected to steam distillation to remove contaminants. The aqueous residue was then extracted with dichloromethane and the product (R)-4-cyano-3-hydroxybutyric acid was isolated in 80% chemical yield after solvent evaporation and simple vacuum distillation/<br><br>
