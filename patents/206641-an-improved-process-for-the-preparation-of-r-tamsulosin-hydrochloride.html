The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed. <br><br>
AN IMPROVED PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF (R) (-) TAMSULOSIN HYDROCHLORIDE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD:<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of (R)(-) Tamsulosin<br>
hydrochloride	[(R)(-)-5-[2-[[2-(o-ethoxy-phenoxy)ethyl]aminop2-methylethyl]-2-<br>
methoxybenzenesulfonamide hydrochloride] of formula (III),<br><br><br><br>
III<br>
The (R)(-) Tamsulosin hydrochloride of formula (III) produced by the process has an alpha-adrenergic blocking action and possesses a hypotensive activity and is used mainly for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
WO 02/068382A1 describes the process for the preparation of (R)(-)-Tamsulosin hydrochloride III by the condensation of I with 2-ethoxy phenoxyacetyl chloride IV to give 2-(2-ethoxy-phenoxy)-N-[2-(4-methoxy-3-sulfamoyl-3-phenyl)-1- methylethyl] acetamide ( V .) which on reduction with lithium aluminium hydride yielded R-(-) Tamsulosin hydrochloride (III), (Scheme-I).<br><br>

The process described therein yields the Tamsulosin hydrochloride in a very poor yield (37%). Moreover, in the process described therein, (R)(-) Tamsulosin hydrochloride (III) purification is proposed using 1 column chromatography which is expensive, time consuming and impractical at industrial scale. ,<br>
Importantly,  it  is found  that in  the above  process  of US  '478,  the  base compound of Formula I, which is used as a free base and reacted with the<br>
4<br><br>
compound of Formula II resulted in a final product (Tamsulosin Base) with contaminants of unreacted compound of Formula I. This lead to difficulties in isolating the final product and also loss in yield of Tamsulosin Hydrochloride alongwith problems of purity.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is thus the basic object of the present invention to provide a process for the preparation of (R)(-) Tamsulosin Hydrochloride, which would be high yielding, cost effective, easy to operate at industrial scale and would not involve the use of moisture sensitive, pyrophoric compounds.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process of manufacture<br>
of	[(R)(-)-5-[2-[[2-(o-ethoxy-phenpxy)ethyl]amino]-2-methylethyl]-2-<br>
methoxybenzenesulfonamide hydrochloride] which would avoid unreacted contaminants in the final product and provide for isolating and obtaining the final product with good yield and purity.<br>
Yet another objective of the invention is to provide a process for the preparation o.f (R)(-) Tamsulosin Hydrochloride that would not require the handling of hazardous reagents, such as LAH.<br>
A further objective of the invention is to provide a process of manufacture of [(R)(-)-5-[2-[[2-(o-ethoxy-phenoxy)ethyl]amino]-2-methylethyl]-2-methoxybenzenesulfonamide hydrochloride] that would involve selective mild reaction conditions.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide a process of manufacture of [(R)(-)-5-[2-[[2-(o-ethoxy-phenoxy)ethyl]amino]-2-methylethyl]-2-methoxybenzenesulfonamide    hydrochloride]    that    would    be    industrially favourable in that the same would use less amount of solvent, hence increase the plant capacity and will also require less manpower.<br>
5<br><br>
A further object of this invention is to provide the method of purification which' would be industrially feasible for /large scale preparation of [(R)(-)-5-[2-[[2-(o-ethoxy-phenoxy) ethyl] a'mino]-2-methylethyl]-2-methoxy benzene sulfonamide hydrochloride].<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention provides a process for the preparation of (R)(-) Tamsulosin Hydrochloride [ (R)(-)-5-[2-[[2-(o-ethoxyphenoxy) ethyl] amino]-2-methylethyl]-2-methoxybenzenesulfonamide hydrochloride] (III) comprising reacting R-(-)-5-[(2-amino-2-methyl)ethyl]-2-methoxy benzenesulfonamide hydrochloride (I) with the compound of formula (II) wherein X represents F, CI, Br, I, OSO2CH3, OSO2CF3, Tosylate o-Toluene Sulfonates (OTs), Brosylate p-Bromobenzene Sulfonate (OBs), Nosylate p-Nitrobenzene sulfonate (ONs) or any other suitable leaving group in the presence or absence of a suitable catalyst, a suitable base, in a organic solvent.<br>

It would be apparent from the above comparative study results of the process of the invention vis-a-vis the process of US'478 that the process of the invention which involves the use of salt of compound of Formula I instead of `its base form as proposed in US'478 achieves higher yield of the final product (Tamsulosin Base )and serves as a selective industrially applicable process for the manufacture of Tamsulosin hydrochloride of Formula III.<br><br><br>
