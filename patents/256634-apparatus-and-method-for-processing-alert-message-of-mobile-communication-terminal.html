BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a mobile communication terminal and, more<br>
particularly, to an apparatus and method for processing an alert message of a mobile<br>
communication terminal.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
In general, a mobile communication terminal is a device for allowing a user to<br>
wirelessly page and be connected with another party for communication any time anywhere<br>
through switching control by an MSC (Mobile Switching Center) while moving in service<br>
areas covered by base stations (BSs). With the mobile communication terminal, data<br>
communication performed in symbols, numbers and characters and multimedia<br>
communication including image signals as well as voice communication can be available.<br>
Most of the recently developed mobile communication terminals include an<br>
external or internal camera, with which a subject image can be received, and thus, video as<br>
well as a still image can be transmitted on a real time basis, providing wider utilization<br>
range such as video call.<br>
A display unit of the related art mobile communication terminal will now be<br>
described with reference to Figure 1.<br>
Figure 1 is a perspective view showing an opened state of a related art mobile<br>
communication terminal.<br><br><br>
As shown in Figure 1, the related art mobile communication terminal includes a<br>
first display unit 10 directed to a user when the mobile communication terminal is opened,<br>
and a second display unit (not shown) directed to the user when the mobile communication<br>
terminal is closed. The first display unit is located on an inner side of a flip body 12,<br>
whereas the second display unit is located outside the terminal on the outer side of the flip<br>
body 12. Thus, at any given point of time, the user can see only the first or second display<br>
unit.<br>
The first display unit 10 displays and performs functions selected by a user, for<br>
example, call communication, message transmission/reception, still image and video<br>
shooting, a mobile game, video call, when the mobile communication terminal is opened.<br>
The second display unit displays state information of the mobile communication terminal<br>
provided to the user, for example, radiowave reception strength, setting of vibration or bell<br>
sound, alarm setting, battery capacity, current time and date, when the mobile<br>
communication terminal is closed.<br>
The first display unit 10 cannot fully display and execute multiple tasks<br>
simultaneously. For example, when the user executes a video operation on the first display<br>
unit 10 and a call is received at the same time, a call notification/image appears partially by<br>
overlapping with the video being displayed and a portion of the video is hidden. As a<br>
result, the tasks being executed on the first display unit 10 interfere with each other.<br>
As mentioned above, as for the related art mobile communication terminal, the first<br>
and second display units are installed on the opposite sides of the flip body and only one of<br>
the first and second display units is used according to the opening or closing of the mobile<br>
communication terminal, resulting in a problem that the display units cannot be effectively<br>
used simultaneously.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus and method<br>
for processing an alert message of a mobile communication terminal capable of effectively<br>
using multiple display units simultaneously by displaying alert messages on a second<br>
display unit according to a type of a task being executed on a first display unit.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a mobile terminal and an<br>
apparatus and method for displaying alert messages of the mobile terminal, which<br>
overcome the limitations and disadvantages associated with the related art.<br>
To achieve at least the above objects in whole or in parts, mere is provided in one aspect<br>
of the present invention, an apparatus for processing an alert message of a mobile<br>

As shown in Figure 2, the mobile communication terminal includes a first body 110<br>
rotatably connected with a second body 120. The first body 110 includes a first display<br>
unit 100. The second body 120 includes a second display unit 200 located at an upper<br>
portion of the second body 120 and other known components such as key pads, etc. The<br>
second display unit 200 is positioned at a slant angle or in other fashion so that when the<br>
user opens the mobile terminal, the user can easily and fully see both the first and second<br>
display units 100 and 200 and so that when the user closes the mobile terminal, the user<br>
can easily see the second display unit 200. The mobile communication terminal can be a<br>
cellular phone, but is not limited thereto. The first and second display units 100 and 200<br>
can be any known display devices such as liquid crystal displays, etc.<br>
When the mobile communication terminal is opened, both the first and second<br>

can separately execute an operation, irrespective of an operation being executed on the first<br>
display unit 100, and display a list, which indicates operation(s) being executed on the first<br>
display unit 100, in an icon, a figure, character form, or some other manner depending on<br>
the type of the operations being executed on the first display unit 100.<br>
In addition, the second display unit 200 can display and perform any information<br>
and tasks that are processed on the second display unit of the related art mobile<br>
communication terminal.<br>
The apparatus for processing an alert message of a mobile communication terminal<br>
in accordance with the first embodiment of the present invention will be descried below<br>
with reference to Figure 3.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates the construction of an apparatus for processing an alert message<br>
of a mobile communication terminal in accordance with the first embodiment of the<br>
present invention. This apparatus is provided in the mobile communication terminal, e.g.,<br>
in the second body 120. The apparatus is discussed in connection with the mobile terminal<br>
of FIG. 2 (and FIG. 5), but is applicable to other similar devices according to the present<br>
invention.<br>
As shown in Figure 3, the apparatus for processing an alert message of a mobile<br>
communication terminal in accordance with the first embodiment of the present invention<br>
includes: a message generator 30 including at least one module for generating alert<br>
message(s) and outputting the generated alert message(s); and a controller 40 for<br>
selectively displaying the outputted alert message(s) on the second display unit 200<br>
according to the type of each task being executed on the first display unit 100.<br>
The alert message can be a notice message, a result message, a response message, a<br>
status message, or others.<br>
Particularly, the message generator 30 includes a first module 31 for generating a<br><br><br>
notice message for informing about a call reception, a message reception, alarm, battery<br>
capacity, etc.; a second module 33 for generating a result message informing about a<br>
proceeding or a result of uploading or downloading of a file or message transmission, etc.;<br>
and a third module 35 for generating a response message to a set result of USSD<br>
(Unstructured Supplementary Services Data), IM (Instant Message)/PTT (Push To Talk),<br>
etc. Any number of modules can be provided in the message generator 30 and these<br>
modules can be implemented with computer software programs written in any known<br>
program language.<br>
A method for processing the alert message of a mobile communication terminal in<br>
accordance with the present invention will now be described with reference to Figure 4.<br>
Figure 4 is a flow chart of a method for processing an alert message of a mobile<br>
communication terminal in accordance with the first embodiment of the present invention.<br>
This method can be implemented in the devices of FIGs. 2 and 3 or in other suitable device<br>
(s).<br>
As shown in Figure 4, the method in accordance with the first embodiment of the<br>
present invention includes: generating an alert message and outputting the generated alert<br>
message (step S41); determining whether a task executed on a first display unit is a screen<br>
occupancy task (step S43); and selectively displaying the outputted message on a first or<br>
second display unit according to the result of the determining step S43 (steps S45 and<br>
S47).<br>
This method in FIG. 4 will be described in detail as follows.<br>
First, when the mobile communication terminal executes multiple tasks, e.g., in<br>
response to a user's selections, the message generator 30 generates alert message(s)<br>
according to the state of an inactive task and outputs the generated alert message(s) (step<br>
S41).<br><br><br>
Upon receiving the outputted alert message, the controller 40 determines whether<br>
the task being executed on the first display unit 100 is a screen occupancy task (step S43).<br>
The screen occupancy task refers to a task requiring continuous screen output by being<br>
connected to a network such as a video call or a VOD (Video On Demand), which is set by<br>
a manufacturer or the user.<br>
Thereafter, the controller 40 selectively displays the inputted alert message on the<br>
first or second display unit 100 or 200. That is, if the task being executed on the first<br>
display unit 100 is a screen occupancy task, the controller 40 displays the received alert<br>
message on the second display unit 200 since the first display unit 100 is needed for the<br>
task on the first display unit 100 (step S45). If, however, the task being executed on the<br>
first display unit 100 is not a screen occupancy task, the controller 40 temporarily<br>
interrupts the execution of the task being executed on the first display unit 100, and<br>
displays the received alert message on the first display unit 100. After a certain time has<br>
passed or in response to a certain action (e.g., a response for the user), the displaying of the<br>
alert message may end and the controller 40 resumes the task on using the first display unit<br>
100.<br>
Various examples of displaying alert messages in various situations on the second<br>
display unit 200 of the mobile communication terminal of FIGs. 2 and 3 in accordance<br>
with the first embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail as follows.<br>
In a first example, the controller 40 receives a notice message such as a call<br>
reception, a message reception, alarm, battery capacity or the like and displays the received<br>
notice message on the second display unit 200.<br>
For instance, the user can receive a new message while the mobile communication<br>
terminal is executing an Internet service operation for the user's Internet surfing through<br>
the first display unit 100, which can be considered a screen occupancy task. At this time,<br><br><br>
the controller 40 displays on the second display unit 200 a notice message informing that<br>
the new message has been received. Accordingly, the user can check the new message<br>
through the second display unit 200 without interrupting the Internet service operation in<br>
progress. Herein, the new message can include a short message, a long message, a<br>
multimedia message, an e-mail, and so on.<br>
In a second example, the controller 40 receives a result message informing about<br>
the proceeding of file uploading/downloading and message transmission and displays the<br>
received result message on the second display unit 200.<br>
For instance, while the user is downloading a file through the Internet using the first<br>
display unit 100, he/she can also perform multi-tasking to continuously proceed with a<br>
different task. For example, after starting the downloading of the file using the first display<br>
unit 100, the user can execute a message function for transmitting a message. Then, when<br>
the file downloading is completed, the controller 40 displays an alert message informing<br>
about the result as well as the status of the file downloading on the second display unit<br>
200.<br>
The multi-tasking does not depend on or supplement an operation but involves<br>
executing multiple independent operations with the same level simultaneously. For<br>
example, an executed task refers to one of (1) an online service such as an online game, a<br>
mobile Internet service, a VOD function or a file downloading function, (2) various<br>
message functions such as chatting, instant messaging, text messaging, multimedia<br>
messaging and an e-mail function, (3) a call function such as a voice call or a video call,<br>
(4) a camera function such as video shooting or still image shooting, and (5) various<br>
supplementary functions such as a scheduler, phone book searching, a calculator, a memo<br>
note, communication content sound recording, communication content video recording,<br>
setting of a terminal state, calendar searching, overseas time checking, watch alarm setting,<br><br><br>
or reproducing of a video or music file.<br>
In a third example, the controller 40 receives a response message informing about<br>
the completion of setting of the USSD, the IM/PTT or the like, and displays the received<br>
response message on the second display unit 200.<br>
For instance, while the user is executing the Internet service operation such as the<br>
Internet surfing on the first display unit 100, he/she can receive the response message with<br>
respect to the USSD and IM/PTT program. At this time, the controller 40 displays the<br>
received response message on the second display unit 200. In this case, when the user sets<br>
a certain value for the telephone network system through a network, there can be an<br>
origination number presentation or a prohibition of the origination number presentation, a<br>
service request/release operation in case of the USSD, and registration of a new user for<br>
the telephone network system in case of the IM/PTT. The response message in the USSD<br>
and the IM/PTT means, e.g., a message informing about such a processing result.<br>
A mobile communication terminal in accordance with a second embodiment of the<br>
present invention will now be described with reference to Figure 5.<br>
Figure 5 is a perspective view showing an opened state of a mobile communication<br>
terminal in accordance with the second embodiment of the present invention.<br>
As shown in Figure 5, compared to the first embodiment of the present invention in<br>
which the display units are separately installed, the mobile communication terminal in<br>
accordance with the second embodiment of the present invention is constructed such that<br>
one display unit is divided into multiple regions each with a predetermined size to form<br>
multiple display parts or screen parts.<br>
More specifically, the mobile communication terminal includes the first and second<br>
bothes 310 and 320. The first body 310 includes a display unit 500 divided into two parts<br>
- first and second display parts 300 and 400. The first and second display parts 300 and<br><br><br>
400, respectively, function in the same manner as the first and second display units 100 and<br>
200 of the first embodiment, except that they are part of the same display unit. The second<br>
body 320 includes known components such as key pads.<br>
The apparatus for processing an alert message discussed in connection with FIG. 3<br>
is also included in the mobile communication terminal of FIG. 5 and performs the same<br>
functions therein.<br>
Further, the method of FIG. 4 is equally applicable to the mobile communication<br>
terminal of FIG. 5. In this regard, the first and second display parts 300 and 400 would<br>
correspond respectively to the first and second display units mentioned in the method of<br>
FIG. 4.<br>
That is, the principles of the operation of the apparatus for processing an alert<br>
message of the mobile communication terminal in accordance with the second embodiment<br>
of the present invention are the same as those of the first embodiment, and a detailed<br>
description of which is thus omitted.<br>
If needed, the invention also includes some means for the user to switch a<br>
key/selection operation between the first and second display units or parts so that<br>
appropriate selections using the first or second display part/unit may be made. For<br>
instance, a key/button for switching between the first and second display units 100 and 200<br>
(or 300 and 400) can be provided on the mobile terminal, so that the existing keys can be<br>
used to make selections on both the first and second display units. As one example, while<br>
the user is surfing the Internet using the first display unit/part, a switch button can be<br>
selected in which case the user can now make selections on the second display unit/part<br>
using the key pads on the mobile terminal. In another example, different keys/buttons may<br>
be provided so that the user can maneuver the menus/images displayed on each of the first<br>
and second display units/parts at the same time if desired. In still another example, the<br><br><br>
second display unit/part may only be used to display and not to receive any user input<br>
thereto. In that case, the first display unit/part would receive all user inputs. Other<br>
variations are possible.<br>
As so far described, the apparatus and method for processing an alert message of a<br>
mobile communication terminal in accordance with the present invention has such an<br>
advantage that alert messages are displayed on the second display unit according to a type<br>
of a task executed on the first display unit, so multiple display units can be effectively used<br>
simultaneously.<br>
The foregoing embodiments and advantages are merely exemplary and are not to be<br>
construed as limiting the present invention. The present teaching can be readily applied to<br>
other types of apparatuses. The description of the present invention is intended to be<br>
illustrative, and not to limit the scope of the claims. Many alternatives, modifications, and<br>
variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. In the claims, means-plus-function<br>
clauses are intended to cover the structure described herein as performing the recited<br>
