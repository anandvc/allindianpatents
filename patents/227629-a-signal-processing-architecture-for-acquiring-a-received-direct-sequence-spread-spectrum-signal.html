				<td>A SIGNAL PROCESSING ARCHITECTURE FOR ACQUIIRING<br>
A RECEIVED DIRECT SEQUENCE SPREAD SPECTRUM SIGNAL<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a signal processing architecture for<br>
acquiring a received direct sequence spread spectrum signa , and more particularly<br>
to novel architectures for performing direct acquisition of spread spectrum signals<br>
using long codes, including signals with binary offset carrier modulation. The<br>
invention further relates to signal acquisition methods resulting in a high degree of<br>
parallelism, such as can be achieved through the use of code matched filter banks<br>
and other hardware sharing techniques. The invention has applicability to<br>
radionavigation systems, communications, and radar systems.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The use of spread spectrum technology for radionavigation or communications<br>
is well known in the electrical engineering arts. Spread spectrum communication is<br>
advantageous in communication applications requiring high reliability in a noisy<br>
environment There are several types of spread spectrum systems, including direct<br>
sequence spread spectrum ("DSSS") systems, frequency hopping systems, time<br>
hopping systems, pulse frequency modulated (or chirp) systems, and various hybrids.<br>
Of these, DSSS systems and frequency hopping systems are perhaps the more widely<br>
implemented. One system that uses DSSS technology is the Global Positioning<br>
System ("GPS"). The GPS is a constellation of satellites orbiting the earth and<br>
fransmitting DS-SS signals. Receivers process signals from multiple satellites in<br>
order to determine their own position and location. GPS downlink signals are<br>
currently transmitted in two frequencies in L-band: L1, centered at 1575.42 MHz,<br>
and L2, centered at 1227.6 MHz.<br>
When GPS was originally designed, it comprised two different downlink<br>
signals for radionavigation, corresponding to two different services. The precise<br>
positioning service (PPS), was intended for authorized (primarily US and Allied<br>
military) users, and employs the precision/encrypted (P(Y)) code signal. The standard<br>
positioning service (SPS) is available for use by any user worldwide, and employs the<br>
coarse acquisition (C/A) code signal. While me C/A code signal is currently<br>
transmitted only on L1, the P(Y) code signal is transmitted on both L1 and L2.<br><br>
M-Code Signal for GPS and BOC Modulations<br>
As part of GPS Modernization, the U.S. Government is adding new signals in<br>
addition to the existing GPS signals. The C/A-code signal (or a signal with identical<br>
modulation but different spreading code and data modulation) will be transmitted on<br>
L2. In addition, a new signal for military use (the M-code signal) will be transmitted<br>
on both L1 and L2. The M-code signal is designed to provide additional capabilities<br>
and performance, especially enhanced jamming resistance, while remaining<br>
compatible with reception of current GPS signals.<br>
The M-code signal uses a novel modulation, denoted binary offset carrier<br>
("BOC"), which contributes both to performance and to spectral compatibility with<br>
existing signals. BOC modulations are described by their subcarrier rate and their<br>
spreading code rate; the M-code signal uses a subcarrier rate of 10.23 MHz and a<br>
spreading code rate of 5.115 MHz. Other developments of advanced radionavigation<br>
systems, including the European Galileo development, are also considering the use of<br>
BOC modulations, possibly with different subcarrier rates and spreading code rates.<br>
One critical characteristic of BOC modulations is that they typically offer much<br>
narrower correlation function peaks, providing better ranging accuracy in noise and<br>
multipath. For a more detailed description of BOC signals and their properties, see<br>

Direct Acquisition of Signals with BOC Modulations<br>
GPS satellites that transmit the M code signal will be launched as early as in<br>
2003. New receivers are being developed for reception and processing of the M-code<br>
signal. An essential aspect of GPS signal receiver processing is signal acquisition,<br>
where the receiver aligns its internal timing and frequency to the precise values of the<br>
received signal. Before acquisition begins, the receiver's internal timing and frequency<br>
references are in error by certain amounts. The sizes of these errors depend upon a<br><br>
number of factors, including operational conditions, receiver design, and signal<br>
design.<br>
Direct acquisition, where the receiver performs acquisition without use of<br>
transmitted acquisition aids, involves cross-correlating a locally generated reference<br>
signal against time and frequency-shifted versions of a received signal. In DSSS<br>
processing, the reference signal is a replica of the pseudo-noise (PN) sequence code<br>
used to spread the spectrum of the received signal at a transmitter. The ability of a<br>
DSSS system to suppress radio-interference is directly proportional to the ratio of the<br>
PN code symbol, or "chip", rate to the data rate. The cross-correlation over both time<br>
lag and frequency offset is termed a complex ambiguity function. The coordinates of<br>
the location where the magnitude of the cross-ambiguity function achieves a<br>
maximum (or "peak") reveal the time lag and frequency offset that align the reference<br>
signal with the received signal.<br>
Direct acquisition is the baseline approach for acquisition of the M code<br>
signal. Figure 1 is helpful in understanding direct acquisition processing. Direct<br>
acquisition involves a search over a set of time and frequency values that represent the<br>
receiver's uncertainty region 102, which is typically quantized into discrete time and<br>
frequency cells 104. The receiver performs multiply-accumulate processing to<br>
compute a test statistic (or "metric") for each time-frequency cell 104. Appropriate<br>
time lags (or "code offsets") and frequency offsets are determined by testing the<br>
metrics to determine if they exceed a predetermined threshold indicating<br>
synchronization. All cells 106 whose metrics exceed the threshold typically undergo a<br>
verification process before the acquisition processing declares that the signal has been<br>
acquired.<br>
Major contributors to time uncertainty window 108, which can vary from a<br>
few spreading code periods to millions of spreading code chip periods, include the<br>
absolute and relative inaccuracy of system clocks, an unknown distance between the<br>
transmitter and receiver, and the code period. Typically, the time-domain extent of a<br>
cell 110 is one-half a chip period (i.e., the distance between the cross-ambiguity<br>
function's peak and its first zero).<br>
Unknown Doppler shifts and the drift of a receiver's oscillator are major<br>
sources of frequency uncertainty 112 and can range from tens of hertz for stationary<br><br>
transmitters and receivers to kilohertz for receivers and transmitters installed in high-<br>
speed platforms. The frequency-domain extent of a cell 114 is typically half the<br>
reciprocal of the coherent integration time being used in direct acquisition processing.<br>
The search over the time and frequency uncertainty region 102 can be<br>
performed as a serial search or a parallel search. One difference between serial search<br>
methods and parallel acquisition methods is the number of cells 104 searched at one<br>
time. Serial search methods compute and analyze one time-frequency cell 104 at a<br>
time. Parallel methods, on the other hand, are primarily distinguished by the selected<br>
implementation method of short-time correlation processing and by the number of<br>
cross-correlations being calculated simultaneously. Parallel methods compute<br>
quantized correlation "tiles" 116 containing multiple time-frequency cells 104. For<br>
example, tiles could be dimensioned to be 5 milliseconds by 800 Hz in size.<br>
Parallel methods are frequently implemented in hardware by using code-<br>
matched filters (CMFs), which calculate new correlation samples at a rate<br>
proportional to the rate at which the received signal is sampled. CMFs use finite-<br>
impulse response-like structures to correlate input signals fed into them with the<br>
locally-generated reference signal. Within CMFs, spreading code values are treated as<br>
filter taps and are stored in semi-permanent registers. CMFs are versatile because they<br>
can be implemented using time-domain methods, frequency-domain methods, or a<br>
combination of the two.<br>
Existing designs for direct acquisition process the signal over its entire<br>
bandwidth, using digital processing with a sampling rate established to ensure that at<br>
least two samples fall on the peak of the cross-ambiguity (or "correlation") function.<br>
Since the M-code signal's correlation function has a narrow peak, this approach would<br>
require high sampling rates. And because the rate of arithmetic operations needed for<br>
direct acquisition processing is roughly proportional to the square of the sampling<br>
rate, existing approaches lead to computationally complex methods for direct<br>
acquisition of BOC modulations. In fact, skilled practitioners in spread spectrum<br>
signal acquisition have indicated that unaided direct acquisition using CMF<br>
architectures of the M code signal is extremely complex, and implementations would<br>
not be practical for many years.<br><br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides numerous hardware efficient cross-correlation<br>
designs and signal processing architectures (SPAs) incorporating those designs that<br>
achieve a high degree of parallelism in the acquisition phase of processing received<br>
signals, such as DSSS signals, with special capabilities for binary offset carrier (BOC)<br>
modulations. The parallelism is achieved without increasing the hardware required by<br>
the correlation designs or SPAs by a commensurate amount. Use of SPAs in<br>
accordance with the present invention allows a receiver to quickly align itself with the<br>
received signal, in both time and frequency, even in the presence of severe<br>
interference. The present invention is able to achieve search speeds mat are several<br>
times faster than existing designs known to the applicants.<br>
One aspect of the invention's novelty is in the way it takes advantage of upper<br>
and lower sidebands of BOC modulations, such as are present in the GPS M code<br>
signal. Specifically, the upper and lower sidebands can be treated as two independent<br>
signals with identical spreading codes. This enables the use of lower sample rates<br>
compared to conventional direct acquisition designs.<br>
Another aspect of the invention involves an achieved high degree of hardware<br>
(e.g., multiplier, adder and data shift register) reuse for code matched filter banks<br>
(CMFBs) employed in a number of the embodiments. These make advantageous use<br>
of separate processing of in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) phases of the carrier signal,<br>
upper and lower sidebands, and odd and even sampling.<br>
The techniques described below allow minimization of on-chip memory in<br>
application specific integrated circuits (ASIC's) or field programmable gate arrays<br>
(FPGA's) implementing the cross-correlation means and SPAs. Selected<br>
embodiments require no intermediate on-chip or off-chip memory for partial coherent<br>
sums, and use off-chip memory only for the purpose of storing non-coherent<br>
integration results.<br>
In a first embodiment, the present invention provides a SPA for acquiring a<br>
received DSSS signal. The SPA includes a means for sampling the received DSSS<br>
signal at a predetermined sampling rate, and means for cross-correlating, in a parallel<br>
fashion, time and frequency shifted versions of the sampled DSSS signal with<br>
samples of a locally generated replica of a psuedo random noise (PN) code sequence<br><br>
used to spread the spectrum of the DSSS signal at a transmitter, thereby obtaining a<br>
set of cross-correlation values. An optional code Doppler compensation means<br>
coupled to the cross-correlating means pre-processes the cross-correlation, values in<br>
order to compensate for misalignment effects resulting from time-companding of the<br>
received DSSS signal. Coupled to the code Doppler compensation means is a means<br>
for non-coherently integrating groups of the compensated cross-correlation values in<br>
order to calculate correlation metrics, the sum of the magnitudes of which are<br>
evaluated for a correlation peak (or "maximum").<br>
The cross-correlation means, in preferred embodiments, is comprised of a one<br>
or more banks of CMFs for computing parallel short-time correlations (STCs) of the<br>
received signal samples and replica code sequence samples, and a means for<br>
calculating the cross-correlation values utilizing discrete-time Fourier analysis of the<br>
computed STCs. One or more intermediate quantizers may optionally be disposed<br>
between the bank of code matched filters and the cross-correlation calculation means<br>
for reducing word-sizes of the STCs prior to Fourier analysis. This has the benefit of<br>
reducing hardware complexity of these embodiments for all subsequent processing<br>
(e.g., the Fourier analysis, code Doppler compensation, non-coherent integration, and<br>
correlation detection).<br>
The CMFs may also re-use multiply-and-accumulate hardware in cross-<br>
correlation by interleaving in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) components of the<br>
received DSSS signal samples and computing the STCs for the interleaved<br>
components in a pipelined fashion. In this embodiment, the CMFs operate at twice<br>
the received signal sampling rate, and each CMF is further comprised of two data<br>
shift registers per tap for holding the interleaved components.<br>
In selected embodiments, the SPA further comprises means for digitally<br>
selecting and re-sampling two or more sidebands from a received DSSS signal having<br>
multiple sidebands, as do binary offset carrier (BOC) signals. Samples of each<br>
selected and re-sampled sideband may similarly be interleaved and processed by the<br>
CMFs in a pipelined fashion. In this embodiment, each CMF has additional data shift<br>
registers as needed for holding the interleaved sideband data, and each operates at a<br>
rate equal to the product of twice the number of selected sidebands and the<br>
predetermined re-sampling rate. If four sidebands are selected, for example, the CMFs<br><br>
will operate at four times the received signal re-sampling rate, resulting in a hardware<br>
re-use factor of four (4). If I and Q components of each of these four sidebands are<br>
interleaved and the code matched filters operated accordingly faster, then the<br>
hardware re-use factor may be increased to eight (8).<br>
The cross-correlation means may further comprise a means for re-sampling the<br>
received DSSS signal at a rate equal to an integer multiple of the nominal chip rate of<br>
the spreading code, and each CMF has a corresponding summing network including<br>
hardware means for storing partial correlation sums and adding partial correlation<br>
sums from previous clock cycles to compute the cross-correlation values. This re-use<br>
of partial correlation sums results in a reduction of multipliers (and associated<br>
summing hardware) required for each CMF by a factor equal to the integer multiple.<br>
The optional code Doppler compensation means further comprises circuitry<br>
for applying delays to input streams of the cross-correlation values corresponding to<br>
frequency-shifted versions of the received DSSS signal and the replica code sequence<br>
and for selecting appropriate delays to be applied based upon a number of non-<br>
coherent integrations performed. In preferred embodiments, this is accomplished<br>
through the use of a plurality of integer and fractional delay lines for coarse and fine<br>
adjustments, respectively, of Doppler frequency dependent delays. Code Doppler<br>
compensation circuits are initialized and incremented or updated for a variable<br>
number of non-coherent integrations, preferably through the use of a table of<br>
coefficients and an integration counter.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the present invention provides a SPA for acquiring<br>
a received multiband input signal, comprised of a means for selecting multiple<br>
sidebands from the received multiband input signal, a means for cross-correlating a<br>
. replica of a PN code sequence used to spread the spectrum of the transmitted signal<br>
with time and frequency shifted versions of each selected sideband to obtain cross-<br>
correlation values, a means for non-coherently combining the cross-correlation values<br>
to obtain correlation metrics, and means for detecting whether the magnitudes of the<br>
correlation metrics exceed a detection threshold. The SPA of this embodiment may<br>
also include a means for down-sampling each selected sideband at a predetermined<br>
down-sampling rate to obtain the versions of each selected sideband. It may also<br>
include independently controllable quantizers for quantizing the versions of each<br><br>
selected sideband, and means for controlling a loading factor of the quantizers. The<br>
loading factor control mechanism may be an automatic gain control or similar circuit.<br>
The non-coherent integration means controls the relative timing between the<br>
replica code sequence and the received signal, realigning the replica code sequence to<br>
the chip boundary at the start of each new time uncertainty. Code sequence segments<br>
overlapping in time between groups of cross-correlation values compensate for<br>
invalid samples resulting from code Doppler processing, post peak-detection idle time<br>
resulting from situations in which a correlation peak is detected at the end of a<br>
correlation tile, and changes in the number of samples available for processing as a<br>
result of code Doppler effects. The non-coherent integration means includes a<br>
mechanism for: loading and swapping of consecutive non-contiguous code sequence<br>
segments into and out of CMF dual register banks to support seamless switching<br>
between processing multiple data blocks of a correlation tile; controlling the<br>
realignment of the received signal to the chip boundary along with the local replica<br>
code sequence when switching time uncertainties; controlling initiation of a new data<br>
block for a given time offset during the integration process; controlling a signal that<br>
distinguishes invalid data (from the code Doppler processing) and valid data at the<br>
end of the integration process; controlling discarding of unused samples at the end of<br>
the integration process for a given time uncertainty; and coordinating the initiation of<br>
the integration process for the next time uncertainty.<br>

Detailed Description of Certain Preferred Embodiments of the Invention<br>
Preferred embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference<br>
to the accompanying drawings.<br>
Although much of the description that follows addresses GPS receivers for<br>
BOC modulated signals, and specifically M code GPS signals employing BOC (10,5)<br>
modulation, the description of specific embodiments is intended for exemplary<br>
purposes only and by no means meant to be limiting. For example, it will be<br>
understood by artisans that the cross-correlation architectures described are also<br>
suitable for use in.systems (e.g., radar) wherein the signals to be correlated will not be<br>
spread spectrum signals.<br>
Each of the cross-correlation and signal processing architectures disclosed<br>
herein enable an increase in hardware efficiency when compared to existing<br>
technologies. Each architecture employs a separate technique that may be found<br>
alone in a SPA or in combination with the other described innovations.<br><br>
Simplifications described below lend themselves to integrated circuit designs that are<br>
feasible to implement while providing optimal performance.<br>
To facilitate understanding, a description of an acquisition SPA incorporating<br>
a number of the innovations will be described, followed by a more detailed<br>
description of each feature of the SPA. A couple of the innovations will be described,<br>
for the purpose of clarity, in isolation from the first SPA described, but artisans will<br>
readily understand how these techniques could be incorporated.<br>
Acquisition SPA Employing Parallel Cross-Correlation Engine Followed By Doppler<br>
Compensation And Non-Coherent Integration<br>
A SPA 200 for acquiring a DSSS signal in a parallel fashion in accordance with<br>
one embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in Figure 2. SPA 200 includes<br>
a pre-conditioner 202 the received DSSS signal 204, including preferably an analog-to-<br>
digital converter (ADC) 205, means 206 for sampling and/or re-sampling at<br>
predetermined sampling rates, one or more optional intermediate quantizers 208,<br>
sideband selection module 210, and interleaver 224. A cross-correlation means 212<br>
cross-correlates time and frequency shifted versions of the pre-conditioning means<br>
output 228 with samples of a replica PN code sequence 213 obtained from a local PN<br>
code generator 214. Then an optional code Doppler compensator 216 compensates for<br>
signal companding effects due to Doppler, and is followed by a non-coherent<br>
integrator 218, having a memory buffer 220, that integrates multiple compensated<br>
cross-correlation values 217 representing searches of particular time and frequency<br>
offsets. Detector module 222 accepts the output 219 of the non-coherent integrator<br>
218, which comprises test statistics (or metrics), for discovery of correlation peaks<br>
through comparison to a threshold.<br>
Preconditioner 202 prepares and pre-processes the received signal 204 in<br>
preparation for cross-correlation. In various embodiments, sampling means 206 can<br>
perform received signal sampling at a predetermined rate using ADC 205, and re-<br>
sampling of in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) phase components of the sampled signals.<br>
One or more intermediate quantizers 208 are employed in some embodiments for<br>
quantizing the sampled (or re-sampled) data. And certain embodiments, as will be<br>
described below, include sideband selection module 210 for selecting one or more<br><br>
sideband of multiple-sideband received signals. Those embodiments that employ<br>
sideband selection and/or I/Q re-sampling also include interleaver 224 for combining<br>
the resulting multiple sample streams for input into the cross-correlation means 212.<br>
The cross-correlation means 212 cross-correlates in a parallel fashion, time and<br>
frequency shifted versions of the sampled received signal with samples of the locally<br>
generated replica of a pseudo random noise (PN) code sequence used to spread the<br>
spectrum of the transmitted DSSS signal. The cross-correlation means 212 can be<br>
implemented using active correlators (e.g. multiply-accumulators) passive correlators<br>
(e.g. CMFs), or hybrids that combine both active and passive means (e.g. a single CMF<br>
performing short-term correlations followed by a bank of accumulators to accumulate<br>
the short-term correlations). In each embodiment, correlation across frequency can be<br>
achieved by using backend discrete Fourier analysis (e.g. using an Fast Fourier<br>
Transform (FFT), Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), Winograd Fourier Transform, or<br>
a Walsh Transform).<br>
In addition, non-coherent integrator (NCI) 218 may be used to extend the<br>
ability of the receiver to acquire DSSS signals in high levels of noise and interference.<br>
This is accomplished by adding a pre-determined number of correlation blocks to form<br>
a single time-frequency tile. Each correlation block is a set of correlation vectors<br>
generated by the CMFB. The correlation block is dimensionally identical to the time-<br>
frequency tile. During long non-coherent integrations, code Doppler compensator 216<br>
can be used to improve detection performance. Code Doppler compensator 216 is<br>
coupled to the cross-correlation means 212 and pre-processes cross-correlation values<br>
output by the cross-correlation means 212 in order to compensate for misalignment<br>
effects resulting from time-companding of the received DSSS signal. NCI 218<br>
integrates groups of the compensated cross-correlation values to obtain correlation<br>
metrics.<br>
After non-coherent integration, the detector module 222 is employed to detect<br>
whether the correlation metrics exceed a detection threshold, thereby determining<br>
whether the DSSS signal has been acquired. Detector module 222 includes noise floor<br>
estimator 2S4 for estimating the magnitude of the average of cross-correlation values<br>
when the received signal and the replica signal are not aligned, and dection logic 223.<br>
Herein, this average value is referred to as the noise floor. A detection threshold is<br><br>
calculated by multiplying the noise floor by a detection threshold offset that is<br>
dependent on the desired number of false alarms per second.<br>
Cross-Correlation Using A Code-Matched Filter Bank Correlator<br>
Of the several ways of computing cross-correlations in a parallel fashion, the<br>
preferred method is to use a Code-matched filter Bank Correlator (CMFBC).<br>
Simplified versions of an SPA architecture that uses CMFBC for cross-correlation,<br>
without the present innovations, can be found in M. K. Sust, et al., "Rapid Acquisition<br>
Concept for Voice Activated CDMA Communications," IEEE Globecom 90,<br>

Acquisition in Nonselective and Frequency-Selective Rician Fading Channels," IEEE<br>

Figure 3 illustrates an example embodiment of a CMFBC 226 used to perform<br>
cross-correlations of the digitized signal output 228 from the preconditioning means<br>
202 with stored samples 230 of the replica code 213 generated by code generator 214<br>
in a fully parallel fashion. CMFBC 226 is comprised of a bank of Nf CMFs 232 that<br>
compute short-term correlations 234 (STCs) of length NT, followed by an FFT<br>
structure 236 mat coherently integrates the STCs 234 across different frequency<br>
offsets, thereby computing a series of test statistics 238. The purpose of one or more<br>
quantizers 252 inserted between the bank of Nf CMFs 232 and FFT structure 236 will<br>
be described below.<br>
As depicted in Figure 4, each CMF 232 is comprised of one or more data shift<br>
registers 240, code tap registers 248 for storing replica code samples 230, an array of<br>
multipliers 242, and a supporting summing network 244 (e.g., an adder tree<br>
represented for simplicity purposes as a single adder element) for summing partial<br>
correlation products. Summing network 244 is actually comprised of<br><br><br>
adder elements.<br>
Each CMF 232 performs a correlation of the stored replica code sequence<br>
samples 230 with differently delayed versions of pre-conditioner output signal 228.<br>
The different delays can be implemented with a Nr tap delay line coupled to the<br>
output of preconditioner 202. As will be described in more detail below, in selected<br>
embodiments pre-conditioner output signal 228 may be in-phase (I) and quadrature<br>
(Q) components of the upper and lower sidebands of received signal 204. This<br>
represents four filtering operations each requiring Nr taps. Since the same replica<br>
code sequence samples 230 are used by each CMF 232, a potential for hardware<br>
optimization exists. Digitized signal data is written sequentially into the data memory<br>
as it becomes available. In each CMF 232, the inner product between the digitized<br>
signal 228 and replica samples 230 for a given code offset is generated all at once.<br>
Each element of the input signal data shift-register 240 is multiplied by the<br>
corresponding element of the tap in the code-tap registers 248 using a corresponding<br>
multiplier in the array of multipliers 242. The summing network 244 then sums the<br>
multiplier output signals 245.<br>
When all the multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations needed for the coherent<br>
integration are implemented in hardware, mere is no need for intermediate storage to<br>
cache partial cross-correlation sums. This is in contrast to existing architectures that<br>
use parallel active correlators or the hybrid active-passive cross-correlation means,<br>
which reuse arithmetic resources for computing the coherent integration and suffer a<br>
large penalty for intermediate memory storage. Their reuse of arithmetic resources<br>
also results in a much longer signal acquisition time. The PN code sequence samples<br>
230 are not updated at each clock cycle, but are treated as filter taps and stored in the<br>
semi-permanent code-tap registers 248.<br>
Referring again to Figure 3, the bank of NfCMFs 232 simultaneously<br>
computes all the partial STCs 234 needed by the backend FFT structure 236. It is the<br>
ability to calculate all the needed partial cross-correlation values 234 at the same time<br>
that assists in making the CMFBC 226 (and SPA 200) a fast solution and the only<br>
solution not requiring intermediate memory to store partial correlation sums. Rather<br>
than employing one large CMF, Nf CMFs 232 of length NT are used to calculate<br><br>
STCs 234 on different segments of the input signal 228 and replica code data. NT is<br>
selected based on<br><br>
where<br>
Nj is the desired coherent integration time,<br>
Fs is the rate of received signal sampling, and<br>
Nf is the number of short time CMFs.<br>
For each new input signal 228, each CMF 232 computes one NT-length STC<br>
234. The STC length NT is designed such that Fs/ NT is greater than or equal to the<br>
extent of frequency uncertainty to be searched in parallel. A 2*Nf-point FFT (zero<br>
padded) is then applied to the STCs 234 by backend FFT structure 236. Zero-padding<br>
is a convenient way of interpolating between frequency bins and reducing scalloping<br>
loss. This provides coherent processing gain while resolving the desired frequency<br>
uncertainty with a proper frequency resolution. After FFT processing, a magnitude<br>
estimator is utilized for each frequency band in preparation for further non-coherent<br>
processing.<br>
CMF Hardware Sharing for Processing I and O Signal Components<br>
Prior art techniques employ separate dedicated hardware for processing in-<br>
phase (I) and quadrature phase (Q) components of received signals. This is illustrated<br>
in Figure 5, wherein the I and Q components are shown employing separate sets of<br>
correlating hardware 50, 52.<br>
In contrast, and with reference to Figure 6, selected embodiments of SPA 200<br>
employ one or more CMFs 232 that re-use multipliers 260 and summing network 262<br>
hardware in cross-correlating the replica code sequence samples 230 with I<br>
components 264 and Q components 266 of the pre-conditioned received DSSS signal<br>
204. A simplified description of the process by which the I and Q components are<br>
obtained is as follows. Following down-conversion and filtering, the received signal<br>
204 is digitally converted by ADC 205 and sampled at a predetermined sampling rate<br>
by sampling module 206 of preconditioner 202 to obtain the I and Q components<br><br>
264,266. The I and Q components are then interleaved (by interleaver 224) for<br>
processing in a pipelined fashion by one or more CMFs 232. In order to process<br>
twice the input data, the one or more CMFs 232 of this embodiment operate at twice<br>
the sampling rate at which received signal 204 was sampled. Additionally, each of<br>
the one or more CMFs 232 has two data shift registers 240 per filter tap 268 for<br>
temporarily storing the interleaved I and Q components while other components are<br>
being correlated.<br>
Illustrated in Figure 6 is a CMF 232 that performs a cross-correlation of the I<br>
and Q phase components 264, 266 with a sample of the replica code 230. As a result,<br>
a filter structure can be implemented that reuses a single one of the multipliers 260 for<br>
two cross-correlations. Note that although the number of input signal data shift<br>
registers 240 remains constant, this optimization results in a factor of two reduction in<br>
the required number of multipliers 260 and reference code registers 248, and reduces<br>
an associated number of required surnrning network 262 adders. Since CMF hardware<br>
dominates the size of any ASIC or FPGA implementing the present invention,<br>
pipelining the I and Q samples processing yields an overall reduction in chip<br>
hardware by approximately a factor of two.<br>
CMF Hardware Sharing for Processing Sampled Reference PN Codes<br>
The preferred means for implementing a CMF 232 in accordance with the<br>
present invention employs an optimized summing network with a reduced hardware<br>
requirement. In certain embodiments, sampling module 206 includes means for re-<br>
sampling the received signal 204 at a rate equal to an integer multiple of the nominal<br>
chip (or "spreading code") rate applied to the signal at the transmitter. Each CMF 232<br>
employed in these embodiments has a plurality of multipliers whose required number<br>
may be divided by the integer multiple selected for a particular CMF design. Each<br>
summing network is adapted to store partial correlation sums and to add partial<br>
correlation sums from previous clock cycles in computing the cross-correlation<br>
values.<br>
Assuming the received signal 204 is sampled at approximately M times the<br>
rate of the replica code sequence (i.e., the spreading code) signal c, and the integration<br><br>
NT is a integer multiple of M, then the cross-correlation function y(n) simplifies as<br>
follows:<br>
if<br><br>
where:<br>
NT is the length of the short-time correlations,<br>
ci is the ithlter tap,<br>
x(n) is the input signal, and<br>
y(n) is the output signal.<br>
Using Equation 1, y(n) can further be rewritten as a function of y(n-1):<br><br>
This implies that y(n) can be estimated using only a code-match filter of length<br>
NT/M. So, with this innovation, the number of multipliers and supporting adders in the<br>
summation network in a CMF can be reduced by a factor M.<br>
This is best understood with the aid of Figures 7A and 7B, which shows a<br>
simple CMF 232 having four taps 268. Rather than employing four multipliers 260 to<br>
multiply the same samples X(1), X(3) of input signal X(n) by the same reference code<br>
samples c(0), c(1) twice and obtaining identical partial products c(0)X(1) 270 and<br>
c(1)X(3) 272 twice for different CMF output signals Y(0) and Y(1) on consecutive<br>
clock cycles, CMF 232 stores in data shift register 274 the partial sum of the product<br>
the first time it is computed, then reuses it in computing the next sequential CMF<br><br>
output signal. Note that at the transition at the correlation block boundary or at the<br>
start of a new time-frequency tile, the partial sum of products register 274 must be<br>
cleared since the new correlation block would be corrupted by partial products<br>
generated by the previous correlation block's reference code. Another option is to<br>
ignore the outputs from the CMF at the transition until the pipeline is cleared.<br>
This approach reduces the number of correlator taps 268 by an additional<br>
factor of two. The number of input data shift registers 240 for the input signal does<br>
not change, but overall the number of multipliers 260, replica code registers 248, and<br>
adder tree elements 276 required in the summing network is thus decreased by a<br>
factor of two, as shown in the lower circuit illustrated in Figure 7A and in the<br>
alternative representation of Figure 7B. Note that the summing network now has<br><br>
adder elements 276.<br>
Quantization At Intermediate Processing Stase<br>
Referring again to Figure 3, certain embodiments of SPA 200 employ one or<br>
more intermediate quantizers 252 disposed between the bank of Nf-CMFs 232 and the<br>
FFT structure 236. This further reduces hardware complexity by reducing word-sizes<br>
of the STCs 234 prior to the Fourier analysis. Insertion of the one or more quantizers<br>
252 reduces the required size of all subsequent circuits (i.e., FFTs, non-coherent<br>
integration hardware, and detection logic module) and off-chip memory requirements.<br>
While the advantages of using quantizers at the input of acquisition SPAs to<br>
reduce circuit complexity are known (See J. Spilker, Digital Communications by<br>
Satellite, Prentice Hall, New Jersey, 1977), there are no acquisition SPAs known to<br>
the applicants that insert quantizers at an intermediate stage. In additive white<br>
Gaussian noise at sufficiently low input signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratios<br>
(SNIRs), processing loss due to quantization is limited to 0.7 dB loss for a 2-bit<br>
quantizer and 1.7 dB for a 1-bit quantizer. In most cases, the processing loss is amply<br>
compensated for by the significant reduction in hardware complexity. DSSS<br><br>
acquisition SPAs designed to receive low SNIR signals commonly assume a 1 or 2 bit<br>
input word size.<br>
The maximum processing loss introduced by one or more quantizers 252 is a<br>
function of the SNIR and loading factor at each quantizer input. The predicted losses<br>
as a signal transitions from a low SNIR to a high SNIR (the situation found in the<br>
coherent cross-correlation processing) has not previously been accurately<br>
characterized through either theoretical or experimental analysis. Unlike the<br>
quantizer(s) located at the front end, where the selection of a 1 or 2 bit quantizer is<br>
satisfactory for all acquisition SPA designs and for most receive scenarios, the<br>
settings of intermediate quantizers 252 are highly dependent on the specific SPA 200<br>
design and design parameters. Appropriate quantizer design parameters (step sizes,<br>
word sizes, and loading factors) may be determined by the application of the formulas<br>
below derived by the applicants that quantify the effects of quantization as a function<br>
of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).<br>
Specifically, by using Equation 3, a designer can determine the minimum<br>
word-size m required to achieve a desired quantizer efficiency e:<br><br>
Where λ is a quantizer loading factor and is the SNIR at the output of<br>
each CMF 232. The efficiency e of intermediate quantizers 252 is defined as the ratio<br>
of the quantizer output signal-to-noise (SNR) to the input SNR and indicates the total<br>
increase in noise introduced by the one or more quantizers. For example, an<br>
efficiency of-1 dB normally implies that the noise power at the output of the<br>
quantizer is 1 dB higher than at the input.<br>
The loading factor λ is the ratio of the total input signal-plus-noise root-mean-<br>
squared (RMS) voltage to the quantizer's full scale voltage (FSV). The loading factor<br>
and the total input RMS voltage are used to select an FSV that prevents overflow or<br>
clipping. The optimum loading factor, normally specified in dB as is a<br>
function of the type of input signal and the number of bits. For an input sinusoid, the<br>
optimum loading factor is The optimum loading factor for a<br>
Gaussian signal varies as a function of the number of bits. Historically, -12 dB,<br><br>
(λ = 1/4) has been used as the default value. Based on results obtained by Morgan,<br>
D., Finite Limiting Effects for a Band-Limited Gaussian Random Process with<br>
Applications to AID Conversion, IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal<br>
Processing, Vol. 36, No. 7, July 1988, pp.1011-1016, herein incorporated by<br>
reference, a simplified formula can be used for deterrnining the loading factor for a<br>
Gaussian signal as a function of the number of bits, using two piecewise linear<br>
approximations:<br><br>
In practice, to determine the required output word-size of the quantizer, the<br>
designer would select a desired quantizer efficiency, select a quantizer loading factor<br>
and predict the maximum expected post-CMF SINR expected by the SPA. For the<br>
loading factor, the designer has the option of selecting a standard loading factor (e.g.<br>
λ = 1/4) or by iteratively estimating the word-size (using Equation 3) and loading<br>
factor (using Equation 4) to determine the optimal word-size and loading factor pair.<br>
An AGC-like circuit can be employed to maintain these parameters at the desired<br>
levels.<br>
Code Doppler Compensation<br>
With reference again to Figure 2, there are numerous causes of mismatch<br>
between the frequency of local replica code sequence oscillators 215 in SPA 200<br>
embodiments and the corresponding frequency of the received signal 204. Two of<br>
these causes are oscillator drift and Doppler shift due to relative motion between the<br>
transmitter and the receiver. Regardless of the physical cause, it is common to refer to<br>
any frequency mismatch as caused by unknown Doppler.<br>
For a truly narrowband transmitted signal (whose bandwidth is infinitesimal<br>
compared to its carrier frequency), any frequency mismatch produces a frequency<br>
shift of only the center frequency, and the FFT processing described above adequately<br>
searches over that unknown frequency offset. For a narrowband signal modeled as a<br>
baseband signal modulated onto a carrier, where the carrier frequency is much greater<br><br>
than the bandwidth of the baseband signal, the effect of frequency mismatch can often<br>
still be modeled to first order as a frequency shift of the entire signal.<br>
When the Doppler shift and the time of interest are large compared to the<br>
bandwidth of the transmitted signal, however, the first-order model is no longer<br>
adequate. Time compression or expansion (known as companding) of the received<br>
baseband signal relative to the locally-generated reference signal produces lack of<br>
correlation, referred to herein as "code Doppler." Equivalently, varying Doppler<br>
shifts across the band occupied by the received signal 204 causes a loss of coherence.<br>
Processing gain is only obtained from long integration times when the processing<br>
compensates for this code Doppler.<br>
The applicants have realized that the loss of coherence due to time<br>
companding of the baseband signal can be compensated by the use of short-time<br>
correlations followed by post-processing. (See J. W. Betz, "Performance of the<br>
Deskewed Short-Time Correlator," in Coherence and Time Delay Estimation, Edited<br>
by G. Clifford Carter, IEEE Press, 1993, J. W. Betz, "Effects of Uncompensated<br>
Relative Time Companding on a Broadband Cross Correlator," IEEE Transactions on<br>
Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, Vol. ASSP-33,No. 3, June 1985, pp. 505-<br>
510, and J. W. Betz, "Comparison of the Deskewed Short-Time Correlator and the<br>
Maximum Likelihood Correlator, " IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and<br>
Signal Processing, Vol. ASSP-32, No. 2, April 1984, pp. 285-294, each of which is<br>
herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.) Given appropriate selection of<br>
integration times for short-time correlations performed by cross correlation means<br>
212, time companding introduces negligible loss of correlation, but does cause a non-<br>
trivial correlation peak location delay upon each short time correlation. Algorithm<br>
simplifications have been developed and analyzed in the cited references to exploit<br>
this phenomenon for low-pass signals.<br>
The Doppler (or any frequency mismatch) between the received signal 204<br>
and a reference signal (shown in the specific embodiment of Figure 2 as the replica<br>
code sequence signal 213) may be modeled as producing both a frequency-shift and<br>
time- companding, both of which must be addressed in the acquisition processing of<br>
SPA 200. However, the frequency-shift and time-companding are both caused by the<br>
same frequency mismatch. An innovative approach described here exploits this<br><br>
relationship to implement a code Doppler compensator 216, an exploded view of<br>
which is illustrated in Figure 8 as including one or more frequency-dependent<br>
fractional delay lines 278 and integer variable delay lines 280 to compensate for time<br>
companding in the frequency search.<br>
The code Doppler compensator 216 design assumes that a constant nominal<br>
sampling and processing clock is utilized. As a result, any mismatch between the PN<br>
spreading code rate of the received signal 204 and the locally generated replica PN<br>
code rate will result in a "drifting" or "creeping" of the cross-correlation peak and<br>
must be compensated. Specifically, if there is a PN code mismatch, then during the<br>
non-coherent integration process that averages correlation blocks, the location of the<br>
actual correlation peak shows up at a slightly different location in time for each<br>
correlation block. If the received code is slower than the local code, the peak will<br>
show up later and later upon successive non-coherent integrations (or sums). If the<br>
received rate is faster, the peak will show up sooner upon each integration (or sum).<br>
The relationship between the carrier frequency Doppler offset A/and the code<br>
rate Doppler offset ΔR is<br><br>
The drift in samples, from the first to the Kth non-coherent integration (or sum)<br>
can be predicted using the following formula:<br><br>
where Ti is the coherent integration time in seconds. The implication of the<br>
drift is that only so many correlation blocks can be non-coherently integrated (or<br>
summed) without correction for the drift.<br>
Since SPA 200 processes multiple frequencies at the same time using a FFT<br>
structure 236, the amount of drift is a function not only of the number of integrations<br>
but also the FFT bin number. For a bank of 16 CMFs and a 32-pt zero-padded FFT,<br>
the drift as a function of non-coherent integrations and code Doppler ΔR is as follows:<br><br><br>
wherein<br>
Lbank is the number of CMFs in the bank,<br>
ΔR is the code Doppler shift,<br>
Rnom is the nominal chip rate,<br>
fnom is the nominal carrier frequency, and<br>
NFFT is the FFT size,<br><br>
If no compensation is made for the drift of the correlation peak as a function<br>
of code Doppler offset and as the number of non-coherent integrations, increasing the<br>
number of integrations beyond a certain point provides no additional benefit A code<br>
Doppler compensation circuit (or algorithm in software implementations) is required<br>
to predict the relative location of the correlation peak from correlation block-to-block<br>
and to apply the necessary delays to make sure the correlation peaks remained<br>
aligned.<br>
To maximize the effects of non-coherent integration processing, series of<br>
correlation test statitistics 238 from different correlation blocks must be properly<br>
delayed (or advanced) for proper block-block correlation peak alignment As each<br>
correlation block is processed, the one or more integer delay lines 280 and fractional<br>
delay lines 278 are initialized and/or updated to counteract the correlation peak drift.<br>
The same delays remain in effect during the calculation of an entire tile.<br>
In the specific embodiment depicted, the fractional delay line 278 employs a<br>
4-tap Lagrangian interpolator that uses a table 284 to assist in proper delay coefficient<br>
selection. In a practical example, only delay coefficients for 16 different delays (0-1<br>
delay, 1/16 sample spacing) are required, however more could be used.<br>
The delay of the integer variable delay line 280 is a function of both the code<br>
Doppler offset and the number of integrations performed. A correlation block counter<br>
286 provides an indication of the number of integrations that have been performed.<br><br>
For exemplary purposes, a 18-tap integer variable delay line 280 is depicted. The<br>
following formula can be used to determine the required integer and fractional delays<br>
(or advances) required to be applied for each frequency bin:<br><br>
where Δfis the carrier frequency Doppler offset of bin 0. (In this case, Δf<br>
refers to difference between the center of the band and the nominal carrier frequency.)<br>
Code Doppler compensator 216 allows for longer non-coherent integration<br>
times, resulting in more efficient acquisition of weak signals.<br>
Code and NCI Control Logic<br>
The non-coherent addition of multiple correlation blocks to form a time-<br>
frequency tile requires a controller for controlling the loading and selecting of the code<br>
segment for correlation against the incoming signal and coordinating the processing of<br>
multiple correlation blocks to form a single time-frequency tile.<br>
Code and NCI control is implemented by control module 227, a programmable<br>
state-machine that generates the required control signals based on external triggers and<br>
the current program settings, e.g., data message rate, number of non-coherent<br>
additions, etc. Figure 2 illustrates a number of the signal connections that control<br>
module 227 has with other components of SPA 200, and Figure 12 illustrates the<br>
relative timing for a cycle of the control process for a SPA embodiment utilizing 10ms<br>
coherent integration, four non-coherent additions, and two time uncertainty regions.<br>
Control module 227 provides signals to the cross-correlating means 212 for loading the<br>
replica code segments and for selecting the appropriate code-bank. These signals are<br>
synchronized with the code generator 214 and system control signals, Block Boundary<br>
and Start Detection. The Block Boundary signal indicates the start of a correlation<br>
block, while the Start Detection signal indicates the final block of non-coherent<br>
integration and the start of detection processing.<br>
For the purpose of this description, assume cross-correlating means 212 is<br>
comprised of two CMF banks. Before the start of a search cycle, control module 227<br><br>
requests (at step 1210) the first block of code from code generator 214 and loads (at<br>
step 1220) the first block into one of the two code banks in cross-correlating means<br>
212. When a search is initiated, control module 227 asserts (at step 1230) a Code Bank<br>
Select signal, requests (at step 1240) and loads (steps 1250, 1260) the next block of<br>
code from code generator 214, and asserts a Block Boundary signal (at step 1280).<br>
The block boundary signal is aligned with a first valid correlation vector from<br>
cross-correlation means 212 and it is asserted at regular intervals 1291, approximately<br>
every 10 ms or 5 ms depending on the data message rate. The first Block Boundary<br>
signal instructs the processing modules (218, 216, 254, 210) to initialize and update<br>
their settings. In particular, the fractional and integer delay settings of Code Doppler<br>
compensation module 216 are initialized and the NCI module 218 initiates the start of<br>
a new non-coherent integration cycle. Subsequent Block Boundary signals adjust the<br>
code Doppler delay and controls the non-coherent integration process. In parallel with<br>
the assertion of the Block Boundary signal, the alternate code bank is selected and a<br>
new code block is requested and loaded.<br>
During the last block of a non-coherent integration cycle, the Start Detection<br>
signal is asserted (in step 1290). This signal indicates the start of valid correlation<br>
vectors into the detection module 222. The negation of the Start Detection signal<br>
indicates the end of the detection process for a particular time uncertainty region. The<br>
Block Boundary signal following the negation of start detect reinitializes all the<br>
processing module settings, e.g., CMF code bank select, the code Doppler settings, and<br>
NCI buffer 220, for processing the next time uncertainty.<br>
The finer details of the code and NCI control processing described above are<br>
influenced by four factors: the CMF filter length, the effects of code Doppler, an<br>
artifact of the code Doppler correction logic, and the implementation of the detection<br>
algorithm.<br>
First, the CMF filter length is (Nf* NT) taps for a 50 Hz data message (10 ms)<br>
and (Nf * NT)/2 taps for a 200 Hz data message (5 ms). Since the filter length is shorter<br>
than the ideal time uncertainty region of 10 ms or 5 ms, the correlation block length<br>
must be extended by fourteen and seven samples respectively to cover the entire time<br>
uncertainty region.<br><br>
The second factor is related to code Doppler effects and occurs if a peak is<br>
located at the edge of a time uncertainty boundary. Partial peaks could appear in two<br>
consecutive time uncertainty regions due to code Doppler effects thus reducing optimal<br>
SNR of the correlation peak. The code and NCI control module 227 ensures that a full<br>
peak is in at least one of the time uncertainty regions by further extending the<br>
correlation block length by nine samples for the worst case code Doppler and<br>
maximum number of non-coherent integrations.<br>
The third factor is introduced by the fractional delay filter 278 of Code Doppler<br>
compensator 216. Upon receiving a Block Boundary signal, new coefficients are<br>
loaded into fractional delay filter 278, which for the purpose of this description has<br>
four-taps. The fractional filter 278 produces four invalid outputs after coefficient<br>
loading. Due to the incorrect filter outputs, the correlation block length must be<br>
extended by four samples and the start detect signal is delayed by four samples relative<br>
to the last block boundary so that the detection module ignores the incorrect samples.<br>
The final factor is a result of the implementation of detector 222. Detector 222<br>
requires seven idle samples after the detection of a peak before a peak is declared<br>
valid. As a result, the correlation block length is extended another seven samples.<br>
The above factors extend the correlation block size by maximum of thirty-four<br>
for the 10msec case and twenty-seven for the 5ms case. These four factors are<br>
controlled by a programmable parameter Nx. The NCI control logic 227 extends the<br>
interval between consecutive Block Boundary signals and the Code Bank Select<br>
signals to ensure that a block is longer than the CMF filter length by Nx chips. The<br>
programmable parameter Nx is computed using the following equation:<br><br>
where<br>
Nideal is the ideal CMF filter length of 51,150 and 25,575 for 10ms/5ms,<br>
Noverlap is the number of samples needed to account for code Doppler<br>
"drift",<br>
Ndiscard is the number of samples discarded prior to detection<br>
to account for the code Doppler fractional delay filter, and<br>
Nidle is the number of idle samples following a peak required by the<br><br>
detection logic 223.<br>
For example, in the case of a 50Hz data message rate and maximum number of<br>
non-coherent additions:<br><br>
Two artifacts manifest from extending the correlation block length: consecutive<br>
code blocks for the same time uncertainty are non-contiguous and the reference code<br>
moves with respect to the symbol boundary. The non-contiguous code blocks are<br>
loaded into alternate banks of the cross-correlating means 212 during the processing of<br>
a time uncertainty region. Reference signal generator 214 provides the code such that<br>
the code blocks are realigned with the signal at the beginning of each block. The<br>
extended signal length for a correlation block has the effect of skewing the reference<br>
code with the symbol boundary. The reference code is realigned at the start of the next<br>
time uncertainty by delaying the block boundary signal. The first code block of time<br>
uncertainty n overlaps the last code block of time uncertainty n+1 since the external<br>
code generator rewinds the code generator to snap back to the symbol boundary. The<br>
interaction of the code and NCI control logic 227 with the external code generator 214<br>
ensures that a peak that is at the edge of a time uncertainty region will not be lost<br>
However, the same peak may appear in both time uncertainty regions and an external<br>
processor will be responsible for detecting duplicate peaks.<br>
Separate Processing Of BOC Upper And Lower Sidebands<br>
With reference to Figure 9, BOC modulation methods use a square wave to<br>
produce signals having an upper sideband 288 and a lower sideband 290 containing<br>
exactly the same information, yielding a wider bandwidth than received signal 204.<br>
The sidebands 288,290 are fully coherent with each other. The received signal's<br>
subcarrier frequency and spreading code rate can be selected independently, offering<br>
considerable flexibility in signal design. Optimal performance for radionavigation is<br>
obtained by processing both sidebands 288,290 coherently in frequency, obtaining<br>
better signal-to-noise ratio and ranging accuracy. However, substantial simplification<br><br>
can be obtained in acquisition processing by treating upper sideband 288 and lower<br>
sideband 290 as two independent signals with identical spreading codes. A SPA 200<br>
in accordance with this aspect of the invention further comprises filtering means 292<br>
for separately digitally selecting and re-sampling each sideband of the received BOC<br>
modulated signal, followed by separate processing.<br>
In the embodiment illustrated, each sideband is separately correlated with<br>
reference signals 294, 296 corresponding to the upper sideband 288 and lower<br>
sideband 290, respectively. The reference signals 294,296 are equivalent to that of a<br>
binary phase shift key (BPSK) modulated signal having the same spreading code rate<br>
as the received signal 204. The re-sampling rate is typically chosen to be twice the<br>
reciprocal of the spacing between the correlation peak and the nearest zero to the<br>
correlation peak. For a BPSK modulated signal, this re-sampling rate (e.g., 10.23<br>
MHz) is typically twice the spreading code rate (e.g., 5.115 MHz). Shorttime<br>
correlation values resulting from the correlation means 212 processing of the sideband<br>
data are non-coherently combined, then non-coherently integrated over time. In<br>
contrast, conventional acquisition processing methods would process both sidebands<br>
of the signal coherently. And since the resulting wideband correlation function has<br>
much closer spacing between the peak of the correlation function and the nearest zero,<br>
a much higher sampling rate would be required.<br>
For a fixed integration time, arithmetic operations are required to be executed<br>
at a rate approximately related to the square of the re-sampling rate. So, for a fixed<br>
coherent integration time, sideband processing using a much lower re-sampling rate<br>
provides significant simplification, even though the processing must be performed on<br>
both sidebands. Also, storage required in acquisition processing for a fixed integration<br>
time is approximately proportional to the re-sampling rate, so sideband processing<br>
provides a significant reduction in storage complexity as well. As analyzed in P.<br>
Fishman and J. W. Betz, "Predicting Performance of Direct Acquisition for the M<br>
Code Signal," Proceedings of ION 2000 National Technical Meeting, Institute of<br>
Navigation, January 2000, which is herein incorporated by reference, this separate<br>
sideband processing approach allows the re-sampling rate used in acquiring<br>
BOC(10,5) modulated signals to be reduced by approximately a factor of seven,<br>
compared to conventional wideband processing for acquisition. Separate sideband<br><br>
processing for acquisition thus reduces the required rate of arithmetic operations by a<br>
factor of approximately 25, and the storage used by a factor of approximately seven<br>
for a BOC(10,5) modulation. Employing the same rationale, for a BOC(5,l)<br>
modulation, this acquisition processing method allows the re-sampling rate used in<br>
acquisition to be reduced by approximately a factor of 50, compared to conventional<br>
wideband processing for acquisition. Separate sideband processing for acquisition<br>
thus reduces the required rate of arithmetic operations by a factor of more than 1000 ,<br>
and the storage used by a factor of approximately 50 for BOC(5,l).<br>
Hardware Sharing Through Sideband Data Pipelining<br>
•When acquiring multi-band the separate sideband processing described above,<br>
further opportunity exists to re-use CMF hardware even beyond the re-use enabled by<br>
interleaving and pipelining of the I and Q components of the received signal. Related<br>
to the concept described above of separately processing the upper and lower<br>
sidebands of a multiband received signal 300, and with reference to Figure 10,<br>
selected SPA 200 embodiments re-use the same CMF hardware for processing both,<br>
sidebands in a pipelined fashion. This hardware simplification is not restricted to<br>
signals having BOC modulations, but applies to any modulation with separable<br>
sidebands. The following describes the hardware optimizations that allow for sharing<br>
a CMF's hardware resources in this way.<br>
A SPA 200 in accordance with this aspect of the invention further comprises a<br>
filtering means 292 for digitally selecting two (or more) sidebands 288,290 from the<br>
multiband received signal 300, means for down-sampling 298 the selected sidebands,<br>
and an interleaver 302 for interleaving the data 304 from the down-sampled<br>
sidebands. One or more bank of CMFs 232 then compute STCs for the interleaved<br>
sideband data 306 in a pipelined fashion. Each code matched filter 232 has a<br>
sufficient number of data shift registers 240 (four per tap 268 in the specific example<br>
illustrated) for temporarily storing the interleaved sideband data 306, and each CMF<br>
232 operates at a rate that is twice the product of the number of selected sidebands<br>
and the rate at which sideband down-sampler 298 operates (i.e., the down-sampling<br>
rate).<br><br>
This optimization is feasible because STCs computed by the CMFs 232 for the<br>
upper and lower sidebands employ identical replica code sequence samples 230. The<br>
approach simplifies each. CMF's hardware by reducing the required number of<br>
multipliers 260, data shift registers 240, and summing network 262 adders by a<br>
further factor of two (a total factor of four as compared to acquisition SPAs not<br>
employing either technique). The CMF 232 of this specific example operates at four<br>
times the input signal down-sampling rate, which is well within the capabilities of<br>
navigation and communication system technologies.<br>
Figure 11 illustrates a portion of an embodiment of a cross-correlation means<br>
that leverages each, of the hardware sharing techniques described above. Combining<br>
these techniques allows the acquisition SPA hardware (multipliers 260, summing<br>
network 262 adders, and replica code registers 248) to be reduced by an overall factor<br>
of approximately eight (8). This embodiment effectively computes two partial<br>
correlation products per tap 268, with CMF 232 operating at four times the input<br>
signal sampling rate.<br>
CONCLUSION<br>
While emphasis has been placed in me description above upon applications in<br>
radionavigation using BOC modulation's and the GPS M code signal in particular,<br>
many of the techniques disclosed herein are much more broadly applicable. All of the<br>
innovations described herein apply to a broad set of BOC modulations, and not<br>
merely the BOC(10,5) modulation employed for the M code signal. Depending on the<br>
specific BOC parameters, the feasibility and benefits of these innovations may be<br>
greater or less than those for the M code signal. In general, both the feasibility and<br>
benefits improve for BOC modulations where the ratio of subcarrier frequency to<br>
spreading code rate is high.<br>
Many of the designs apply also to modulations other than BOC. In particular,<br>
sideband acquisition processing applies to any modulation having separate sidebands.<br>
Use of a bank of code matched filters and an FFT-based frequency search and non-<br>
coherent integration applies to any modulation, as does carrier phase hardware<br>
sharing. Sideband-domain sharing of hardware applies to any modulation having<br>
separate sidebands, while code-domain sharing of hardware applies to virtually any .<br><br>
modulation. The intermediate quantization and requantization and code Doppler<br>
compensation techniques have broad applicability to many applications.<br>
While the M code signal uses a long spreading codes (i.e., spreading code with<br>
period of many seconds), the innovations described here also apply and are beneficial<br>
for signals using short codes. In fact, there are opportunities to use even simpler<br>
variants of the acquisition SPA if the signal is spread by a short code. If the initial<br>
time uncertainty is greater than the code period, for example, the circuit need search<br>
only over one period to find the phase of the code.<br>
Even simpler variants of the acquisition SPA can be developed for situations<br>
where fast acquisition in high jamming is not required. One variant would be not to<br>
use non-coherent integration, eliminating the storage and processing required for non-<br>
coherent integration. This strategy would not produce much reduction in the size of an<br>
acquisition chip itself, however, since most of the on-chip hardware implements the<br>
CMFs, which would still be required. Another variant would be to use shorter<br>
coherent integration time through a combination of fewer CMFs and a smaller number<br>
of samples per short-time correlator, with non-coherent integration as needed. This<br>
variant would produce substantial reductions in on-chip hardware, while also reducing<br>
the ability to acquire fast in high levels of interference.<br>
Other embodiments of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art<br>
from a consideration of the specification or practice of the invention disclosed herein.<br>
It is intended that the specification and examples herein be considered as exemplary<br>
