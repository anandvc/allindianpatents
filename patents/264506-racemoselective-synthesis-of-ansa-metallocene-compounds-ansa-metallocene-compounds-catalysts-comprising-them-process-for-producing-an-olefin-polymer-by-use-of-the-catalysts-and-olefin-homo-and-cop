HOMO- AND COPOLYMERS<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a novel racemoselective synthesis of ansa-metallocene compounds, novel ansa-metallocene compounds useful as components in polymerization catalysts, a process for the polymerization of olefins, particularly propylene, and olefin homopolymers, random and impact copolymers prepared by using the metallocene catalysts.<br>
2.	Background of the Art<br>
Chiral ansa-metallocenes of transition metals of the groups three to six of the Periodic Table of Elements are increasingly being used as components for the stereospecific polymerization of olefins. For example, bridged substituted bis(indenyl) zirconium dichlorides arc among the.most important class of catalyst components for the manufacturing of isotactic polypropylene [Brintzinger, H. H.; Fischer, D.; Miihlhaupt, R.; Rieger, B.; Waymouth, R. M. Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. Engl. 1995, 34, 1143. / Resconi, L.; Cavallo, L.; Fait, A.; Piemontesi, F. Chem. Rev. 2000, 100, 1253 / Pasquini, N. (Editor), Polypropylene Handbook, 2nd Ed. 2005, Carl-Hanser Verlag Miinchen], Appropriately substituted ansa-metallocene complexes for the generation of isotactic polypropylene are generally obtained as mixtures of the racemic form and the undcsired meso form from the processes of the prior art.<br>
The classical synthesis of ansa-metallocenes to the prior art generally involves the deprotonation of a bis-indenyl-ligand by a strong base, followed by the reaction with zirconium tetrachloride or its solevent adducts. This classical path has two substantial drawbacks, instead of<br>
the desired racemate, almost equivalent amounts of the mirror-symmetric meso diastereomer are formed in most cases. The meso isomer has to be removed from the mixture, either by means of destruction of the meso form, or removal by crystallization steps. The separation procedure generally lowers the yield of the amount of possible pure racemic complex. The other drawback is the low solubility of metallocene complexes, which leads to the use of large amounts of solvents for the final separation of the racemic and meso forms.<br>
Several, so called "racemoselective" syntheses were described in the literature [see LoCoco, M. D-; Zhang, X.; Jordan, R. F.? J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126 (46); 15231-15244 and cited lit], comprising the use of alternative zirconium sources, which have to be synthesized prior to the manufacturing of the metallocene. WO2004/037840, W099/15538 and DE10030638 describe<br>
multistage processes for preparing racemic metallocene complexes via biphenoxide- or bisphenoxide-subsntated metalJocenes as intermediates. These approaches lead to metallocenes substituted at zirconium with oxide or amide moieties. These intermediates have to be converted<br>
the corresponding dichlorides in order to use them as catalyst components, thus adding extra steps to the synthesis.<br>
US5,304,614 describes 2,4,7-substituted trialkyl-substituted metallocenes, which were obtained as mixtures between the racemic and the meso forms.<br>
It is an object of this invention to provide novel ansa-metallocene structures for the selective preparation of the racemic complexes, which are virtually free of the meso isomer. Not to be bound by any particular theory, the inventors postulate that in order to achieve an intrinsic racernoselectivity, the hindrance of the formation of the meso form might be achieved by steric<br>
hindrance of the formation of the meso form. Attaching two large aromatic substituents to the indenyl- moiety  in the 4- and in the 7-position should hinder the formation of the meso-form of the complexes. Figure 1 illustrates this concept.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to address the shortcoming of the state of the art metallocene compounds to provide metallocenes that afford high melting point, high molar mass homopolymers and high molar mass copolymers at high productivities when used as components of supported catalysts under industrially relevant polymerization conditions at temperatures of from 50°C to l00°C.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the polymerization of olefins, particularly propylene, ethylene, and optionally "one or more higher 1-olefins;<br>
Furthermore, it is an objective of the present invention to provide olefin polymers, Particularly  propylene homopoiymers, random copolymers of propylene with ethylene and/or higher 1-olefins, impact copolymers comprised of propylene, ethylene and/or optionally higher 1-and random impact copolymers comprised of propylene, ethylene and/or optionally higher 1-olefins.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A Metallocene compound having formula 1 below is provided herein, wherein the 4- and<br>
7-position (corresponding to the substituents R5  and R8  , respectively) on the indenyl moiety<br>
possess large  aromatic substituents. The metallocene compound is prepared in accordance with a<br>
method Which produces substantially pure racemic isomer. Advantageously, polymerisation<br>
catalysts comprising the metallocene of the invention provide superior olefin polymerisation<br>
results.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS <br>
Various embodiments are described below with reference to the drawings wherein:<br>
Fig- 1 is. a diagrammatic illustration of the steric effects of attaching two large aromatic<br>
substitute in the 4- and 7- positions of the indenyl moiety (corresponding to the substituents R5 and R8,  respectively, in formula 1); and<br>
Fig- 2 is a diagrammatic illustration of individual steps of the process of the invention for<br>
producing   transition-metal compounds of formula 1.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)<br>
Surprisingly it was found that bridged bis-indenyl ligands with a special substitution<br>
patert lead selectively to racemic ansa-metallocenes.   Particulary, as shown in Fig. 1, when the 4- and 7 positions on the indenyl moiety (corresponding to the substituents R5  and R8  , respectively ) possess large aromatic constituents the affects of steric hinderance prevent the<br>
formation of the meso isomer of the metallocene.   Instead, the product of the method of the<br>
present invention is substantially pure racemic isomer as synthesized without any need for further<br>
seperation processes. By "substantially pure" is meant at least 90% racemic isomer, preferably at least  95% racemic isomer, and more preferably at least 99%-racemie-isomer.<br>

Another embodiment of this invention are the indenes of the formula la and the bis-ihdenyl-ligands of the formula lb, as well as its double bond-isomers:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
in which R3, R3', R4, R4', R5, R5', R6, R6', R7, Rr, R8, R8' and R10 have the meaning mentioned above with the proviso that R and R   each contain at least one carbon atom.<br>
The present invention also includes a process for the racemoselective production of the transition-metal compounds of formula 1 of the invention comprising the following steps:<br>
a)	Deprotonation of the compound of formula la with a base, preferably n-butyl lithium.<br>
b)	If R10 has the meaning M12 R40 R41, where M12, R40, and R41 have the meanings specified above, then the further production proceeds by the reaction of the deprotonated compounds from step (a) with R40 R41v M12 X 2 to form the compound of formula lb, where R40, R41, and M12 have the meanings specified above, and X may be the same or different and means a halogen atom, preferably chlorine, bromine, or iodine, or another leaving group, preferably triflate, tosylate, or mesylate.<br>
c)	Double deprotonation of the compound of formula lb with a base, preferably n-butyl lithium.<br>
d)	Reacting the product from step c) M'Cl4, in which M1 stands for zirconium, titanium, or hafnium, to form the compound of formula 1.<br>
In step a), the compound of formula la, for example, 2-methyl-4,7-bis-(4-t-butylphenyl)indene in an inert solvent, which consists of one or more aromatic or aliphatic hydrocarbons and/or one or more polar, aprotic solvents, is deprotonated with a strong base, for example, n-butyl lithium. The deprotonation is carried out at temperatures of-70°C to 80°C, and preferably 0°C to 80°C. The resulting metal salt is then reacted directly, without further isolation, in step b) with a silicon compound or germanium compound that contains two leaving groups.<br>
Preferential production of the compound of formula lb can be achieved by adjustment of the quantitative proportions. In the following step c), the bis(indenyl)silanes of formula lb are doubly deprotonated with a strong base, such as n-butyl lithium, in an inert solvent, which consists of one or more aromatic or aliphatic hydrocarbons and/or one or more polar, aprotic solvents, and the bislithium salt formed in this way is reacted, without isolation, directly with a source of Ti, Zr, or Hf to obtain the compound of formula 1. The deprotonation is carried out at temperatures of<br>
70°C to 80°C, and preferably 0°C to 80°C. Due to the nature of the ligand system of formula lb, the metallocenes are isolated directly from the reaction mixture as pure racemic compounds.<br>
In Fig. 2, the individual steps of the process of the invention for producing transition-metal compounds of formula 1 are shown once again for the example of a preferred embodiment.<br>
In addition, the present invention relates to a catalyst system comprising at least one compound of formula 1 and at least one cocatalyst.<br>
A suitable cocatalyst component which may be present according to the present invention in the catalyst system comprises at least one compound of the type of an aluminoxane, a Lewis acid or an ionic compound which reacts with a metallocene to convert the latter into a cationic compound.<br>
Aluminoxanes are oligomeric or polymeric aluminum oxy compounds, which may exist in the form of linear, cyclic, caged or polymeric structures. Although the exact structure(s) of aluminoxanes is still unknown, it is well accepted that alkylaluminoxanes have the general formula 6.<br>
(R-AI-O)p    (Formula 6).<br>
Examples for cyclic,  linear or cage structures of aluminoxanes are depicted in the formulas 7, 8 and 9:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
The radicals R in the formulas (6), (7), (8) and (9) can be identical or different and are each a C1 -C20 group such as an alkyl group of from 1 to about 6 carbon atoms, an aryl group of from 6 to about 18 carbon atoms, benzyl or hydrogen and p is an integer from 2 to 50, preferably from 10 to 35.<br>
Peferably, the radicals R are identical and are methyl, isobutyl, n-butyl, phenyl or benzyl, particularly preferably methyl.<br>
If the radicals R are different, they are preferably methyl and hydrogen, methyl and isobutyl or methyl and n-butyl, with hydrogen, isobutyl or n-butyl preferably being present in a proportion of from 0.01 to 40% (number of radicals R).<br>
The aluminoxane can be prepared in various ways by known methods. One of the methods comprises the reaction of an aluminum-hydrocarbon compound and/or a hydridoaluminum-hydrocarbon compound with water, which may be gaseous, solid, liquid or bound as water of crystallization, in an inert solvent such as toluene. To prepare an aluminoxane<br>
having different alkyl groups R, two different trialkylaluminums (AIR3 +A1R'3) corresponding to the desired composition and reactivity are reacted with water, cf. S. Pasynkiewicz, Polyhedron 9 (1990) 429 and EP-A-0 302 424.<br>
Regardless of the method of preparation, all aluminoxane solutions have in common a variable content of unreacted aluminum starting compound which is present in free form or as an adduct.<br>
Furthermore, instead of the aluminoxane compounds of the formulas 6, 7, 8 or 9, it is also possible to use modified aluminoxanes in which the hydrocarbon radicals or hydrogen atoms have been partly replaced by alkoxy, aryloxy, siloxy or amide radicals.<br>
The amounts of aluminoxane and metallocene used in the preparation of the supported catalyst system can be varied within a wide range. However, it has been found to be advantageous to use the metallocene compound of formula 1 and the aluminoxane compounds in such amounts that the atomic ratio of aluminum from the aluminoxane compounds to the transition metal from the metallocene compound is in the range from 10:1 to 1000:1, preferably from 20:1 to 500:1 and in particular in the range from 30:1 to 400:1. In the case of methylaluminoxane, preference is given to using &gt; 30 wt.-% strength toluene solutions, but the use of 10 wt.-% strength solutions is also possible.<br>
As Lewis acid, preference is given to using compounds of the formula 10<br>

The support component of the catalyst system of the present invention can be any organic or inorganic inert solid or a mixture of such solids, in particulate porous solids such as hydrotalcites, talc, inorganic oxides and finely divided polymer powders.<br>
Suitable inorganic oxides, which are preferably employed include from the Periodic Table of Elements Groups 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 13 and 14 metal oxides such as silicon dioxide, aluminum oxide, aluminosilicates, zeolites, MgO, ZrO2, T1O2 or B203, CaO, ZnO, Th1O2, Na2O, K2O, LiO2 or mixed oxides like Al/Si oxides, Mg/AI oxides or Al/Mg/Si oxides.

Particular preference is given to supports having a specific surface area in the range from 200 to 400 m2/g, a pore volume in the range from 0.8 to 3.0 em3/g and a mean particle size of from 10 to 100 µm.<br>
The support materials can be thermally and/or chemically be pretreated in order to adjust certain properties of the carrier such as the water and/or the hydroxyl group content<br>
If the support material has a low moisture content or residual solvent content, dehydration or drying before use can be omitted. If this is not the case, as when using silica gel as support material, dehydration or drying is advisable. Thermal dehydration or drying of the support material can be carried out under reduced pressure with or without simultaneous inert gas • blanketing (nitrogen). The drying temperature is in the range from 80 °C to 1000 °C, preferably from 150 °C to 800 °C and most preferred from 150 °C to 400 °C. The duration of the drying process can be from 1 to 24 hours. But shorter or longer drying periods are also possible.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, support materials with a weight loss on dryness (LOD) of 0.5 wt.% or less, and even more preferred with a LOD of 0.3 wt% or less are used. Higher amounts of physically adsorbed water up to 1 wt% are possible, but result in reduced catalyst activities. The loss on ignition (LOI) of the support material is preferably 1 wt% or greater or even more preferred between 1.5 and 3.5 wt%. The weight loss on dryness (LOD) is thereby defined as the weight loss between room temperature and 300°C and the weight loss on ignition (LOI) as the weight loss between 300°C and 1000°C.<br>
In addition or alternatively, dehydration or drying of the support material can also be carried out by chemical means, by reacting the adsorbed water and/or the surface hydroxyl groups with suitable passivating agents. Reaction with the passivating reagent can convert the hydroxyl groups completely or partially into a form, which does not show any adverse interaction with the catalytically active centers. Suitable passivating agents are silicon halides, silanes or amines, eg. . silicon tetrachloride, chlorotrimethylsilane, dichlorodialkylsilanes, dimethylaminotrichlorosilane, N,N-dimethylanilin or N,N-dimethylbenzylarnine or organometallic compounds of aluminum, boron and magnesium, eg. aluminoxancs, trimethylaluminum, triemylaluminum, triisobutylaluminum, diisobutylaluminum hydride, triethylborane or dibutylmagnesium.<br>
As outlined above, organic support materials such as finely divided polymer powders, can also be used and should, before use, likewise be freed from any adhering moisture, solvent residues or other impurities by means of appropriate purification and drying operations.<br>
Preference is given to using silica gels having the defined parameters as support materials. Spray dried silica grades, which inherently exhibit meso and macro pores, cavities and channels are preferred over granular silica grades.<br>
The supported catalyst system according to this invention can be made in various ways.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, at least one of the above-described metallocene components of formula 1 is brought into contact in a suitable solvent with at least one cocatalyst component, preferably giving a soluble reaction product, an adduct or a mixture. The obtained composition is mixed with the dehydrated or passivated support material, the solvent is removed and the resulting supported metallocene catalyst system is dried to ensure that the solvent is completely or mostly removed from the pores of the support material. The supported catalyst is obtained as a free-flowing powder.<br>
As an example, the process for preparing a free-flowing and, if desired, prepolymerized supported catalyst system comprises the following steps:<br>

d)	isolating the supported catalyst system and<br>

In another embodiment of this invention the metallocene / cocatalyst composition is mixed with the dehydrated or passivated support material, the supported catalyst is recovered and optionally washed with an aromatic hydrocarbon and/or paraffinic hydrocarbon solvent. The isolated catalyst is then dispersed in a non-reactive suspension media such as a paraffinic hydrocarbon solvent, a mineral oil or a wax or mixtures thereof.<br>

According to the present invention, for preparing a free-flowing and, if desired, prepolymerized supported catalyst system, in step b) of the catalyst preparations as mentioned above, instead of an aluminoxane or a mixture of aluminoxanes, at least one alkyl compound of elements of main Groups I to III of the Periodic Table, for example a magnesium alkyl, a lithium alkyl or an aluminum alkyl like trimethylaluminum, triethylaluminum, triisobutyllaluminum, triisopropylalurninum, trihexylaluminum, trioctylaluminum, tri-n-butylaluminum, tri-«-propylaluminum, triisoprene aluminum, dimethyl aluminum monochloride, aluminum monochloride, diisobutyl aluminum monochloride, methyl aluminum sesquichloride, ethyl aluminum sesquichloride, dimethyl aluminum hydride, aluminum hydride, diisopropyl aluminum hydride, dimethyl aluminum(trimethylsiloxide)) dimethyl aluminum(triethylsiloxide), phenylalan, pentafluorophenylalan, and o-tolylalan, can be used. Preferred aluminum alkyls are trimethylaluminum, triethylaluminum, triisobutyllaluminum.<br>
In an even further embodiment of the present invention a free flowing and, if desired, prepolymerized supported catalyst system is prepared comprising the following steps:<br>
a)	preparing a trialkylaluminium/borinic acid mixture in a suitable solvent or suspension medium<br>
b)	applying the trialkylaluminium/borinic acid mixture to a porous, preferably inorganic, if necessary thermally or chemically pretreated support, which was prior treated with a base like N,N-diethylbenzylamine, N,N-dimethylbenzylamine, N-benzyldimethylamine, N-benzyldiethylamine, N-benzylbutylamine, N-benzyl tertbutylamine, N-benzylisopropylamine, N-benzylmethylamine, N-benzylethylamine, N-benzyl-1 -phenylethylamine, N-benzyl-2-phenylethylamine, N,N-dimethyIbenzylamine, N,N-diethylbenzylamine, N-methyl-N-ethylbenzylamine, N-methyldibenzylamine and N-ethyIdi(benzyl)amine,<br>
c)	removing the major part of solvent from the resulting mixture to obtain a supported cocatalyst,<br>
d)	preparing a metallocene/supported cocatalyst mixture in a suitable solvent or suspension medium, where the metallocene of formula 1 is optionally treated with additional<br>
trialkylaluminum,<br>
e)	isolating the supported catalyst system and<br>
f)	if desired, prepolymerizing the resulting supported catalyst system with one or more olefinic monomer(s), to obtain a prepolymerized supported catalyst system.<br>
Preferred solvents for the preparation of the metallocene/cocatalyst mixture are hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon mixtures, which are liquid at the selected reaction temperature and in which the individual components preferably dissolve. The solubility of the individual components is, however, not a prerequisite as long as it is ensured that the reaction product of metallocene and cocatalyst components is soluble in the solvent selected. Suitable solvents are alkanes such as pentane, isopentane, hexane, isohexane, heptane, octane and rionane, cycloalkanes such as cyclopentane and cyclohexane and aromatics such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and diethylbenzene. Very particular preference is given to toluene, heptane and ethylbenzene.<br>
For a preactivation, the metallocene in the form of a solid is dissolved in a solution of the cocatalyst in a suitable solvent. It is also possible to dissolve the metallocene separately in a suitable solvent and subsequently to combine this solution with the cocatalyst solution. Preference is given to using toluene. The preactivation time is from 1 minute to 200 hours. The preactivation can take place at room temperature of 25 °C. In individual cases, the use of higher temperatures can reduce the required preactivation time and give an additional increase in activity. Elevated temperatures in this case refer to a range from 25 °C to 100 °C.<br>
The preactivated solution or the metallocene/cocatalyst mixture is subsequently combined with an inert support material, usually silica gel, which is in the form of a dry powder or as a suspension in one of the above mentioned solvents. The support material is preferably used as powder. The preactivated metallocene/cocatalyst solution or the metallocene/cocatalyst mixture can be either added to the initially charged support material, or else the support material can be introduced into the initially charged solution.<br>
The volume of the preactivated solution or the metallocene/cocatalyst mixture can exceed 100% of the total pore volume of the support material used or else be up to 100% of the total pore volume.<br>
The temperature at which the preactivated solution or the metallocene/cocatalyst mixture is brought into contact with the support material can vary within the range from 0 °C to 100 °C.<br>
However, lower or higher temperatures are also possible.<br>
While the solvent is completely or mostly removed from the supported catalyst system, the mixture can be stirred and, if desired, also heated. Preferably, both the visible portion of the solvent and the portion in the pores of the support material are removed. The removal of the solvent can be carried out in a conventional way using reduced pressure and/or purging with inert gas. During the drying process, the mixture can be heated until the free solvent has been removed, which usually takes from 1 to 3 hours at a preferred temperature of from 30 °C to 60 °C. The free solvent is the visible portion of the solvent in the mixture. For the purposes of the present invention, residual solvent is the portion present in the pores.<br>
As an alternative to the complete removal of the solvent, the supported catalyst system can also be dried until only a certain residual solvent content is left, with the free solvent having been completely removed. Subsequently, the supported catalyst system can be washed with a low-boiling point hydrocarbon such as pentane or hexane and dried again.<br>
The supported catalyst system prepared according to the present invention can be used either directly for the polymerization of olefins or be prepolymerized with one or more olefinic monomers, with or without the use of hydrogen as molar mass regulating agent, prior to use in a polymerization process. The procedure for the prepolymerization of supported catalyst systems is described in WO 94/28034.<br>
It is possible to add, during Or after the preparation of the supported catalyst system, a small amount of an olefin, preferably an alpha-olefin such as styrene or<br>
phenyldimethylvinylsilane as activity-increasing component or an antistatic, as described in U.S. Ser. No. 08/365,280. The molar ratio of additive to metallocene component of formula 1 is preferably from 1:1000 to 1000:1, very particularly preferably from 1:20 to 20:1.<br>
The present invention also provides a process for preparing a polyolefin by polymerization of one or more olefins in the presence of the catalyst system of the present invention comprising at least one transition metal component of the formula 1. For the purposes of the present invention, the term polymerization refers to both homopolyrnerization and copolymerization and the term copolymerization includes terpolymerisation or copolymerisation of more than three different monomers.<br>
Preference is given to polymerizing olefins of the formula Rm-CB&gt;=CH-Rn, where Rm and Rn are identical or different and are each a hydrogen atom or a radical having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, in particular from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, and Rm and R11 together with the atoms connecting<br>
they can form one or more rings.<br>
Suitable olefins are l-olefms, eg. ethylene, propylene, l-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 4-methyl-1-pentene or 1-octene, styrene, dienes such as 1,3-butadiene, 1,4-hexadiene, vinylnorbomene, norbornadiene, ethylnorbornadiene and cyclic olefins such as norbomene, tetracyclododecene or methylnorboraene. In the process of the present invention, preference is given to homopolymerizing propylene or ethylene or copolymerizing propylene with ethylene and/or one or more l-olefms having from 4 to 20 carbon atoms, eg. l-butene or hexene, and/or one or more dienes having from 4 to 20 carbon atoms, eg. 1,4-butadiene, norbomadiene, ethylidenenorbomene or ethylnorbornadiene. Very suitable copolymers are ethylene-propylene copolymers, propylene-1-pentene copolymers and ethylene-propylene-l-butene, ethyl ene-propylene-1-pentene or ethylene-propylene-1,4-hexadiene terpolymers.<br>
The polymerization is carried out at from -60 °C to 300 °C, preferably from 50 °C to 200 °C, very particularly preferably from 50 °C to 95 °C. The pressure is from 0.5 to 2000 bar, preferably from 5 to 100 bar.<br>
The polymerization can be carried out in solution, in bulk, in suspension or in the gas phase, continuously or batchwise, in one or more stages. As an example, impact copolymers are preferably produced in more than one stage. The homopolymer or random copolymer content of such a polymer can be produced in (a) first stage(s) and the copolymer rubber content can be produced in (a) consecutive stage(s).<br>
The supported catalyst system prepared according to the present invention can be used as sole catalyst component for the polymerization of olefins or preferably in combination with at least one alkyl compound of elements of main Groups I to DI of the Periodic Table, for example an aluminum alkyl, magnesium alkyl or lithium alkyl or an aluminoxane. The alkyl compound is added to the monomer or suspension medium and serves to free the monomer of substances, which can impair the catalytic activity. The amount of alkyl compound added depends on the quality of the monomers used.<br>
To prepare olefin polymers having a broad or bimodal molecular weight distribution or a broad or bimodal melting range, it is recommended to use a catalyst system comprising two or more different metallocenes and/or two or more different cocatalysts. Alternatively two or more different catalyst systems of the present invention can be used as a mixture.<br>
As molar mass regulator and/or to increase the activity, hydrogen is added if required. The catalyst system may be supplied to the polymerization system as a solid or in the form<br>
of a paste or suspension in a hydrocarbon or may be treated with inert components, such as paraffins, oils, or waxes, to achieve better metering. If the catalyst system is to be metered into the reactor together with the monomer to be polymerized or the monomer mixture to be polymerized, the mixing unit and the metering line are preferably cooled.<br>
Furthermore, an additive such as an antistatic or an alcohol can be used in the process of the present invention, for example to improve the particle morphology of the olefin polymer. In general it is possible to use all antistatics which are suitable in olefin polymerization processes. It is preferred to dose the antistatic directly into the polymerization system, either together with or separately from the catalyst system used.<br>
The polymers prepared using the catalyst systems of the present invention display an uniform particle morphology and contain no fines. No agglomerates or deposits are obtained in the polymerization using the catalyst system of the present invention.<br>
The catalyst systems of the present invention give polymers such as polypropylene having high molecular weight and cover a broad range of stereospecificity and regiospecificity.<br>
The copolymers which can be prepared using the catalyst system based on metallocenes of formula 1 of the present invention have a significantly higher molar mass compared to the prior art. At the same time, such copolymers can be prepared using the catalyst system of the present invention at a high productivity and at industrially relevant process parameters without deposit formation.<br>
The polymers prepared by the process of the present invention are suitable, in particular, for producing products such as fibers, filaments, injection-molded parts, films, sheets, caps, closures, bottles or large hollow bodies such as pipes with excellent properties.<br>
EXAMPLES The Examples below illustrate the invention. The comparative examples are presented for comparison purposes only and do not illustrate the invention.<br>
General Procedures<br>
The preparation and handling of the organometallic compounds were carried out under argon using Schlenk techniques or in a glove box. All solvents were purged with argon and dried over molecular sieves before use.<br>
The metallocenes produced were characterized by 1H-NMR spectroscopy using a Bruker DMX 500 spectrometer, operating at 500 MHz using CDCU as the solvent.<br>
The polymers produced were characterized by 1H-NMR, I3C-NMR, DSC, GPC, TREF/ATREF, Melt Flow Rate and ER spectroscopy.<br>
1.        Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC), determination of Mw and Mw/Mn<br>
A Waters Alliance/GPCV2000 equipped with a refractometer, a triple capillary on-line viscometer (Waters Corporation, 34 Maple Street, Milford, Massachusetts, 01757 USA) and a light scattering detector PD 2040 (Precision Detectors Inc., 34 Williams Way, Bellingham, MA, USA) was used for the determination of the molar mass data of the samples. 0.05 wt% solutions of the samples in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene were analyzed at a temperature of 145 °C using a Mixed B light scattering quality column (Polymer Labs 1110-6100LS) and a Mixed B guard column (Polymer Labs 1110-1120). Weight average molar mass (Mw) and the ratio of weight average molar mass to number average molar mass (Mw/Mn) were calculated using the Cumulative Matching % Broad Standard procedure that is available in the Waters Millenium 3.2 GPC software module.<br>
2.        NMR Spectroscopy<br>
Samples were prepared by weighing 0.32 g of polymer into 2.5 ml of a 1,2,4-trichIorobenzene/deuterobenzene-d6 (4:1 volume) mixture. Samples were heated to 125°C and mixed until a homogeneous solution was formed (typically 1-4 hours). Spectra were obtained at 120°C on a Varian Inova 500 instrument (Varian Inc., 3120 Hansen Way, Palo Alto, CA, 94304, USA) operating at a l3C-spectrometer frequency of 125.7 MHz and using a 10 mm probe. Spectra were obtained using 5000 scans employing a TC/2 pulse of 10.0 us, a recycle delay of 10.0 s and an acquisition time of 2.5 s. Waltz-16 decoupling remained on throughout the pulse sequence to gain the signal to noise enhancement due to the effects of nOe. Spectra were processed with 1 Hz of line broadening. The mmmm peak in the methyl region of the spectrum was used as an internal chemical shift reference and was set to 21.85 ppm.<br>
Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), determination of the polymer melting point Tm<br>
DSC measurements were carried out using a Mettler Toledo DSC 822e (Mettler-Toledo Inc., 1900 Polaris Parkway, Columbus, OH, 43240, USA). 4 mg of sample were weighed into a standard aluminum pan and subjected to the following temperature schedule:<br>
The samples were heated from room temperature to 220 °C at a heating rate of 20 °C/min, maintained at this temperature for 5 min, then cooled down to -55 °C at a cooling rate of 20 °C/min, maintained at the same temperature for 5 min, then heated to 220 °C at a heating rate of 20 °C/min. The melting point was determined from the second heating run as the temperature where the main peak was observed in the curve.<br>
4.	Analytical TREF (ATREF)<br>
The TREF experiment is carried out on a TREF system built from a modified Waters 2000CV instrument (Waters Corporation, 34 Maple Street, Milford, MA, 01757 USA). The 2000CV instrument is maintained at 140°C in o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) solvent at 1 ml/min flowrate. To detect the polyolefin fractions eluting from the TREF column, the system uses a heated infrared IR4 detector (PolymerChar Company, Valencia Technology Park, P.O. Box 176, Valencia, VA, E-46980, PATERNA, Spain). For cooling and heating of the TREF column, the system uses a temperature-programmable HAAKE Phoenix II oil bath (Thermo Electron Corporation, 401 Millcreek Road, Marietta, OH 45750, USA). The TREF separation column is a stainless steel column of 100 mm long and 0.75 mm diameter packed with 20-micrometer cross-linked polystyrene beads. This TREF column is maintained at the 140°C temperature in the oil bath before the sample analyses. Polymer samples are dissolved in ODCB solvent at 140°C at a concentration of 2 mg/ml. One ml of the test sample of the resultant ODCB solution is injected into the TREF column by the auto-injection system of the Waters 2000CV instrument with a flowrate of ODCB set at lml/min. Following the sample injection, the ODCB flow is diverted away from the TREF column. As the sample is kept inside the column, the column is allowed to cool down in the oil bath from 140°C down to 0°C at the cooling rate of 1.5 °C/min. In this cooling step, the polymer molecules in the test sample are precipitated onto the packing beads in the TREF column. While the column is still at 0°C temperature, a flow of hot ODCB at 1 ml/min is re-introduced to the TREF column for 2 minutes to eiute the soluble fraction of the polymer sample and detected by the IR detector set at 3.4 micrometer wavelength. Then, the temperature<br>
is raised at a heating rate of 2 °C/min while the ODCB flow is maintained at 1 ml/min through the TREF column to elute the higher melting polymer fractions which are being detected on-line by the ER4 detector.<br>
5.	Melt Flow Rate (MFR)<br>
The MFR of the samples were determined according to ISO 1133 at 230°C. Two diffent loads were used: 2.16 kg and 5 kg. Values are reported as MFR(230/2.16) and MFR(230/5), respectively.<br>
6.	Productivity<br>
The  productivity of a  catalyst  is   determined  by dividing  the  produced  mass  of polypropylene by the mass of catalyst used and the reaction time.<br>
7.	Yield<br>
The yield of a sample is determined by dividing the isolated amount of the desired product divided by the theoretical achievable amount of the product.<br>

The catalyst is then<br>
allowed to rest for one hour. The residual solvent is filtered off and the catalyst is washed twice with isohexane (20 mL) and dried in a nitrogen purge to constant weight. The catalyst is obtained as free-flowing orange powder in a yield of 11.5 g.<br>
POLYMERIZATIONS Polymerization Procedure (batch propylene homo- and co-polymerization):<br>
A dry and nitrogen purged 5 dm3 autoclave equipped with a stirrer is charged with if desired 100 g of metallocene polymer seed bed. Optionally, a certain amount of hydrogen is metered in. Triisobutylaluminum (1 cm3 of a 10 wt.-% solution in heptane), liquid propylene (one-half of the total amount used for the run), and optionally, a certain amount of ethylene are metered in and the mixture is stirred for at least 5 minutes (stirrer speed 200 rpm) at 20 °C. Then supported metallocene catalyst, suspended in 5 cm3 of white oil, is injected with liquid propylene (one-half of total amount used for the run). The reactor is heated to the internally measured run temperature (65, 60 or 30 °C) within 11 minutes. The polymerization reaction is allowed to proceed at the run temperature for either 15 or 60 minutes. During the 60 min copolymerization runs the reactor pressure was maintained by continuous feeding of ethylene and propylene. The polymerization is stopped by releasing the monomer and cooling down the reactor. The polymer is discharged and dried under reduced pressure.<br>

Analysis of Results	<br>
Table 1 and Table 2 represent the raw data presented by test run; the remaining tables 3 -5 break that data out by the ratio of propylene to ethylene (or if it is a propylene homo polymer) and whether hydrogen was used in the polymerization process.<br>
Propylene homo polymers<br>
Analysis 1: Production of Propylene homo polymers without the use of hydrogen.<br>
Table 3 shows the results of two experimental Metallocene catalysts conforming to the requirements of the invention compared to a comparative example.<br>
The individual catalyst comparisons between inventive examples 1 and 5 and comparative example 9 substantiate the outstanding improvements over the state of the art. When examples 1 and 5 are compared to comparative example 9, the inventive examples exhibit significantly lower MFR 2.16 rates and increases in Molecular Weight and Polymer Melting Point (Tm). Specifically for MFR 2.16, the inventive examples 1 and 5 show MFR values of less than 0.2 while the MFR of the polymer produced in the comparative example 9 is so high that the MFR was out of range and was not measureable. For the Polymer Melting Point (Tm), the inventive examples 1 and 5 show a respective increase of 3 °C over the original value. For the molecular weight, the inventive examples 1 and 5 show a respective increase of more than 10 to 20 fold over the original value. This dramatic increase of Molecular Weight opens full access to application fields like film, pipe or sheets, where a high Molecular Weight is mandatory.   Even more surprisingly is that the inventive examples showed these dramatic improvements in product properties at much higher productivity levels. Inventive example 1 shows a 69% increase in productivity and inventive example 5 shows a 16% increase in productivity over the original value.<br>
Analysis 2: Production of Propylene homo polymers with the use of hydrogen.<br>
Table 4 shows the results of two experimental Metallocene catalysts conforming to the requirements of the invention compared to a comparative example.<br>
The individual catalyst comparisons between inventive examples 2 and 6 and comparative example 10 again substantiate the outstanding improvements over the state of the art. When examples 2 and 6 are compared to comparative example 10, the inventive examples exhibit significantly lower MFR 2.16 rates and increases in Molecular Weight and Polymer Melting Point (Tm). Specifically for MFR 2.16, the inventive examples 2 and 6 show MFR values of less than 16.3 while the MFR of the polymer produced in the comparative example 10 is so high that the MFR was out of range and was not measureable. For the Polymer Melting Point (Tm), the inventive examples 2 and 6 show a respective increase of 2 to 3 °C over the original value. For the molecular weight, the inventive examples 2 and 6 show a respective increase of more than 10<br>
to 17 fold over the original value. This dramatic increase of Molecular Weight opens full access to application fields like film, fibre and injection moulding, where a Molecular Weight in the achieved range is mandatory.   Even more surprisingly is that the inventive examples showed these dramatic improvements in product properties at much higher productivity levels. Inventive example 2 shows a 87% increase in productivity and inventive example 6 shows a 34% increase in productivity over the original value.<br>
Propylene/Ethylene Co-polymers<br>
The polymerization performance and the properties of products made from the inventive catalysts were tested at two levels of an ethylene/propylene mix to form co-polymers (Table 5). In each case the inventive catalysts from examples 6 and 7 have been tested, and compared against the comparative catalyst from example 8.<br>
Analysis 3: Production of propylene/ethylene co-polymers with a propylene/ethylene ratio of approximately 90 and 30 (20 g resp. 60 g of ethylene) in the presence of hydrogen.<br>
Two inventive catalyst (examples 3, 4 and 7, 8) have tested against the comparative catalyst, (examples 11, 12), the results being presented in Table 5. As before, the inventive catalyst showed significant improvements over the comparative catalyst. Under the applied standard conditions for testing random co-polymers and using the comparative catalyst it was no longer possible to produce a polymer! The product isolated from the polymerisation was a waxy and sticky material. As a consequence, such a catalyst can not be commercially used. Specifically for MFR 2.16, the inventive examples 3, 4 and 7, 8 show MFR values of still less than 10 while the MFR of the waxes (as indicated above, the material was no longer a polymer!) produced in the comparative examples 11 and 12 was so high that the MFR was out of range and was not measureable. For the molecular weight, the inventive examples 3, 4 and 7, 8 show still values above 230 kg/mol which open full access to application fields like high transparent film, fibre and high transparent injection moulding.   Even more surprisingly is that the inventive examples showed these dramatic improvements in product properties at much higher productivity levels. Inventive examples 3 and 7 where 20 g of ethylene was used in the polymerization show a 93% and 34% increase in productivity over the directly comparable value of example 11 and<br>
inventive examples 4 and 8 where 60 g of ethylene was used show a 74% and 61% increase in productivity over the directly comparable value of example 12.<br>
