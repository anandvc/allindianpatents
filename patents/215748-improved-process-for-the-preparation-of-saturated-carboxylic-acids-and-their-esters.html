				<td>This invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of saturated carboxylic acids and their esters. Particularly this invention relates to the process for conversion of olefinicaly unsaturated compounds to corresponding carboxylic acids and esters of formula III wherein, R|, R2 RS, and R4 may independently be hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, arylalkyl, cycloaliphatic with or without substituents, R and R5 may be H and COOR1 or vice versa wherein R' may be H in the case of acids and may be alkyl, aryl, arylalkyl, cycloaliphatic with or without substituents in the case of esters. More particularly, it relates to the employment of an efficient catalyst, which is a compound having the formula I and contains a semilabile anionic ligand which is a chelating organic compound' containing a N donor and an O" group, for the hydrocarbonylation of olefins.<br>
In general, the olefins, which can be converted to corresponding carboxylic acids and esters, include olefins, having a general formula II. In the description here after, the invention will be described essentially in terms of the preparation of the improved catalyst and its employment for the conversion of styrenc by the reaction with carbonmonoxide to phenyl propanoic acids or phenyl propanoates. However it must be understood that the invention is equally applicable to the conversion of other olefins as well.<br>
The aryl and aliphatic carboxylic acids and esters have a variety of applications in industries as, anti inflammatory drugs, fine chemicals etc. The prior art<br><br>
describe catalyst systems for employment in processes for the preparation of esters of carboxylic acids. The best known of such catalysts is homogeneous palladium catalysts. In general, the various catalyst systems used for the hydrocarbonylation of olcfms contain a palladium source, a phosphine ligand and an hydrogen halide promoter. Hydrocarbonylation of olefms using a catalyst system comprising PdCl2 or PdCb(PPh3)2 , excess triphenylphosphine and H(l has been found to occur only at drastic conditions such as 300-700 atm of CO pressure (Bittler et. al., Angew. Chem. Internal. Edit., 7, 1968, 329). ()i ct. al. (J. Mol. Cat. A: Chem., 115, 1997, 289) have reported hydrocsterification of styrene using cationic palladium complexes and which proceeds under mild conditions (2()atm, 80°C) to give 91-94 % product yeild in four hours (TOF= 1 lh-1 ) with n: iso ratio of 60:40. Recently Scayad et. al., (Ind. Eng. Chem. Res., 37, 1998, 2180) have shown enhanced reaction rates in the hydroesterification of styrene (TOF=411h-1) using a catalyst system comprising of Pd(OAc)2, PPh3 and p-toluene sulphonic acid with an n:iso ratio of 35:64 . Eventhough a variety of palladium phosphine complexes have been used for olefin hydroesterification, metal complexes which contain N-containing ligands have never been attempted.<br>
Most of these catalyst systems cause disadvantages during the course of their<br>
employment   for   the   preparation  of carboxylic   acids    and   esters.   These<br>
disadvantages include the requirement of severe conditions, use of excess ligands and promoters.<br>
The inventors of the present invention have observed during the course of their studies that the use of a new transition metal complex of formula I which contains a semilabile anionic ligand which is a chelating organic compound containing a N donor and an O group, provides a novel catalyst for the preparation of saturated carboxylic acids and esters by hydrocarbonylation of olefinicaly unsaturated compounds. The use of such a catalyst gives good yield and selectivity and the catalyst is stable even in the absence of excess ligands and can be recycled efficiently.<br>
The object of the present invention therefore is to provide an improved process for the preparation of saturated carboxylic acids and their esters by the hydrocarbonylation of olefins.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of saturated carboxylic acids and their esters, of formula III of the drawing accompanying the specification wherein R1, R2, R3 and R4 may independently be hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, arylalkyl, cycloaliphatic with or without substituents and R and R5 may be H and COOR' or vise versa wherein R' may be H in the case of acids and may be alkyl, aryl, arylalkyl, cycloaliphatic with or without substituents in the case of esters, which comprises reacting an olefin of general formula III of the drawing accompanying the specification wherein R1, R2, R3 and R4 may independently be hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, arylalkyl, cycloaliphatic with or without substituents, with a compound of formula 1 of the drawing accompanying the specification wherein R1, R2, and R3 are as described above in case of formula II and a protonic acid (or hydrogen gas) and a proton source, in an organic solvent, in<br>
the carbon monoxide atmosphere with or without phosphorous ligand, heating the mixture to a temperature ranging between 30 to 120°C, for a period ranging between 30 to 180 minutes, at a pressure ranging between 1 to 40 atm, cooling the reaction mixture to room temperature, removing the solvent by conventional methods as herein described, separating the compound of formula 1 and isolating the saturated carboxylic acid and esters of general formula III of the accompanying<br>
