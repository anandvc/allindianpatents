PREPARATION AND USE OF HIGH OMEGA-3 AND OMEGA-6 FEED<br>
PRIOR APPLICATION INFORMATION<br>
This application claims the benefit of US Provisional Application<br>
60/635,953, filed December 15, 2004 and US Provisional Application 60/665,846,<br>
filed March 29, 2005.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
High blood lipid levels, especially cholesterol and triglycerides, are a<br>
concern to a significant proportion of the population. However, some fats,<br>
particularly omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have been shown to have<br>
beneficial effects in reducing the risk of heart disease and other conditions. As<br>
such, increasing the omega-3 content of food products has long been a goal of the<br>
food industry.<br>
Some prior art methods have the disadvantage of imparting a "fishy"<br>
odor to the food products produced by or from animals, or reducing milk-producing<br>
or egg-laying production or capacity. Thus, although the benefits of products<br>
having higher omega-3 and/or omega-6 content is well established, attaining these<br>
products in an acceptable and economical way has not been as straight-forward.<br>
For example, US Patent 5,133,963 teaches a method of producing<br>
poultry products with increased concentrations of omega-3 fatty acids using a<br>
poultry feed that has omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and vitamin E and an<br>
enriched water which is fed to the poultry separately. The preferred omega-3<br>
source is "vacuum deodorized fish oil".<br>
US Patent 5,012,761 teaches feeding chickens a composition<br>
including fish oil for producing eggs having higher levels of polyunsaturated<br>
omega-3 fatty acids.<br><br>
WO 2006/063444	PCT/CA2005/001892<br>
2<br>
US Patent 4,918,104 teaches a method of increasing the<br>
concentration of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid in poultry eggs which<br>
comprises administering to the hens an effective amount of preformed omega-3<br>
polyunsaturated fatty acid or a metabolic precursor thereof. Examples of metabolic<br>
precursors given include linolenic acid, linseed oil, fish or a fish derivative. The<br>
feed itself comprised 45-65% corn.<br>
EP 1 021 083 teaches a poultry feeding regime which results in a<br>
higher incorporation efficiency of omega-3 fatty acids which involves feeding the<br>
poultry a higher amount of omega-3 fatty acid in the later phase of the poultry's<br>
production period.<br>
EP 678 247 teaches a food product having a ratio of omega-6 fatty<br>
acid to omega-3 fatty acid of 3:1 to 10:1 for reducing inflammatory and allergic skin<br>
responses.<br>
EP 775 449 describes a method of feeding poultry oil high in omega-<br>
3 fatty acid and omega-6 fatty acid derived from specific microorganisms.<br>
Published US Patent Application 2003/0211221 teaches a method of<br>
producing milk enriched with omega-3 fatty acid and/or omega-6 fatty acid wherein<br>
omega-3 and/or omega-6 are mixed with a protective fat which is not degraded or<br>
hydrogenated in the rumen. Examples of protective fats include tristearine and<br>
other tri-saturated triacylglycerols and di-saturated triacylglycerols.<br>
Published US Patent Application 2001/0000151 teaches a food<br>
product comprising a mixture of microflora Thraustochytrium, Schizochytrium and<br>
mixtures thereof and flaxseed, rapeseed, soybean and avocado meal which has a<br>
balance of long chain and short chain omega-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids.<br>
US Patent 5,985,348 teaches a process for producing microbial<br><br>
WO 2006/063444	PCT/CA2005/001892<br>
3<br>
products with a high concentration of omega-3 fatty acid and the addition thereof to<br>
processed foods and feeds.<br>
US Patent 5,693,358 teaches a method of preparing an animal feed<br>
wherein powdered fish oil is made by processing fishes.<br>
PCT Application WO99/08540 teaches a method of producing a dairy<br>
product enriched in conjugated linoleic acids (CLA) and/or other beneficial<br>
unsaturated fatty acids by feeding the ruminant a diet that includes fish oil or fish<br>
meal.<br>
PCT Application WO 98/47389 teaches a method for producing<br>
omega-3 fatty acid enriched eggs using a feed comprised of corn, soybean meal,<br>
flaxseed, oyster shell, limestone, salt, vitamin premix, mineral premix, vitamin E<br>
premix, methionine, animal/vegetable fat blend, pectinase and glucanase enzyme<br>
product and phosphorus.<br>
PCT Application WO 95/21539 teaches a feed for producing eggs<br>
having an increased omega-3 fatty acid content comprising 1.5-2.5% fish oil, 1-4%<br>
linseed oil and an antioxidant.<br>
PCT Application WO 00/44239 teaches a feed additive comprising a<br>
source of DHA and feather meal.<br>
As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, in view of concerns<br>
regarding outbreaks of diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy<br>
(BSE), the use of animal by-products in feed is less desirable. Clearly, a feed<br>
component capable of producing enhanced levels of omega-3 in animal products<br>
that does not contain animal by-products is needed.<br>

5<br>
harvested from a similar animal fed a standard feed ration.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used<br>
herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in<br>
the art to which the invention belongs. Although any methods and materials similar<br>
or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the<br>
present invention, the preferred methods and materials are now described. All<br>
publications mentioned hereunder are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Described herein is an improved feed component which protects<br>
biologically active substances within the feed such that the biologically active<br>
substances are not degraded or decomposed prior to reaching desired absorption<br>
sites within the digestive tract of the animal. Specifically, in one embodiment, there<br>
is provided an improved feed component for ruminants, wherein the biologically<br>
active substances, for example, omega-3 fatty acids, pass through the rumen<br>
without decomposition and are subsequently absorbed in the abomasums and<br>
subsequent digestive tract. In another embodiment, there is provided a feed<br>
component for poultry. As a result, use of the feed results in animal products, for<br>
example, eggs, milk and meat, having elevated levels of the biologically active<br>
substances, for example, omega-3, CLA and DHA, as discussed below.<br>
As discussed below, the feed is prepared by grinding a quantity of<br>
one or more pulse products or pulse crop products or pulse crop to a powder or<br>
flour, for example, a fine powder, as discussed below. The powder is then mixed<br>
with intact or whole oilseeds so as to form a homogeneous mixture. As will be<br>
apparent to one of skill in the art, intact or whole oil seeds are in contrast with<br>
ground oil seeds or oil seed meal which are typically used in the art. The mixture is<br><br>
WO 2006/063444	PCT/CA2005/001892<br>
6<br>
subjected to a combination and heat and pressure which causes partial<br>
gelatinization of the mixture which in turn makes the carbohydrates and starches<br>
therein more digestible. The heat and pressure are released during the extrusion<br>
of the mixture and the extruded product comprises ruptured oilseeds wherein the<br>
oil released from the ruptured seeds is coated by the ground pulse products, as<br>
discussed below. The mixture is then formed into feed components, for example,<br>
but by no means limited to feed pellets and feed crumbles by means known in the<br>
art. As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, other suitable feed shapes<br>
and/or textures known in the art may be used as well.<br>
It is important to note that the prior art teaches that ground oilseed or<br>
oil extracted from oilseeds must be used in the preparation of feed so that the<br>
animal does not have to digest the seed itself.<br>
As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, the determination of<br>
the ingredients used is based on the need to meet a specific nutrient analysis for a<br>
given feed product, for example, specific oil levels, protein, omega fatty acids and<br>
ruminant by-pass values.<br>
Preferably, the feed product or component has a fat or lipid content<br>
between 18.5-22.5%. Preferably, omega-3 fatty acid is 47.5-57.5% of the total fat<br>
or lipid content while omega-6 fatty acid is 14-24% of the total fat or lipid content.<br>
In addition, the feed product preferably has a protein content of 15-25%.<br>
In one embodiment, the mixture comprises 15-55% ground pulse<br>
crop or pulse product and 45-85% intact oilseed. In an alternative embodiment, the<br>
mixture comprises 45-55% ground pulse crop or pulse products and 45-55% intact<br>
oilseed. In an alternative embodiment, the mixture comprises 65-85% intact<br>
oilseed and 15-35% ground pulse crop or pulse products.<br><br>
WO 2006/063444	PCT/CA2005/001892<br>
7<br>
In one embodiment, the feed mixture consists essentially of 15-55%<br>
pulse crop or pulse product and 45-85% intact oilseed. In an alternative<br>
embodiment, the feed mixture consists essentially of 45-55% pulse crop or pulse<br>
products and 45-55% intact oilseed. In an alternative embodiment, the feed<br>
mixture consists essentially of 65-85% intact oilseed and 15-35% pulse crop or<br>
pulse products.<br>
In yet other embodiments, the feed mixture comprises 10-55% pulse<br>
crop or pulse product, 5-10% roughage, for example, alfalfa, and 45-85% intact<br>
oilseed. In an alternative embodiment, the feed mixture comprises 40-55% pulse<br>
crop or pulse products, 5-10% roughage and 45-55% intact oilseed. In an<br>
alternative embodiment, the feed mixture comprises 65-85% intact oilseed, 5-10%<br>
roughage and 15-30% pulse crop or pulse products.<br>
The pulse products or pulse crop products may be selected from the<br>
group consisting of peas, lentils, chick peas, fababeans, white beans and the like<br>
or combinations or mixtures thereof. It is noted that pulse crops are well known<br>
and well defined in the art.<br>
The oilseeds may be selected from the group consisting of flax,<br>
sunflower, safflower, rapeseed, canola or soybean and the like or combinations or<br>
mixtures thereof. It is noted that oilseeds or oilseed crops which may be used<br>
interchangeably are well known in the art.<br>
The roughage may be alfalfa, for example, but by no means limited<br>
to dehydrated alfalfa or sun-cured alfalfa or may be another suitable form of fiber<br>
known in the art.<br>
As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, the quality of grains<br>
and oilseeds may be variable, meaning that the exact proportion that is used in the<br><br>
WO 2006/063444	PCT/CA2005/001892<br>
8<br>
combinations to make up the feed product could be increased or decreased<br>
depending on the desired oil and protein levels.<br>
In some embodiments, oil seeds which are off-grade, for example, no<br>
more than 20% off grade, may be used and the specific quantity used determined<br>
by the calculated nutrient analysis.<br>
For preparation, the dry ingredients are mixed together to form a<br>
homogeneous mixture and this mixture is then fed into an extruder. Initially, the<br>
pulse products are ground to a fine powder, for example, through a #14 screen or<br>
a #7 screen. As will be known by one of skill in the art, a #7 screen has a screen<br>
size of 7/64 of an inch. After having been ground in this manner, the pulse<br>
products have a consistency that is 60-80% of flour, the balance being 5 microns<br>
or less, that is, at least half of the particles have a diameter of 5 microns or less.<br>
The oil seeds are left in an intact or whole state, that is, in an unground state. The<br>
extruder mechanically creates restrictions which in turn creates high levels of<br>
friction. This in turn heats the mixture and causes the mixture to become<br>
gelatinized which in turn makes the carbohydrates and starches more digestible.<br>
While not wishing to be bound to a specific theory, it is believed that the pressure<br>
and pressure release causes the cell walls to be broken down. Furthermore, cells<br>
that hold the oil of the oilseed grains effectively exploded during this process and<br>
release the oil so it is no longer part of the seed. Thus, on digestion, the oil is<br>
available for use by the animal without the need for the animal to digest the seed<br>
itself. It is further believed that the oil is driven into the ground pulse product<br>
particles which in turn results in the ruminant by-pass, as discussed below. That is,<br>
the oils are separated from the mucilage in the oil seed and consequently the oil is<br>
made more available to digestion by the animals.<br><br>
WO 2006/063444	PCT/CA2005/001892<br>
9<br>
In the case of the production of the feed products, the settings of the<br>
extruder are as follows: pressure is standard (200-400 psi) and the temperature is<br>
within a range of 230F to 350F and the mixture of ground pulse crops and intact oil<br>
seeds are subjected to these conditions for at least 3-60 seconds, 3-45 seconds,<br>
3-30 seconds, 3-20 seconds, 5-45 seconds, 5-20 seconds, 5-30 seconds, 5-15<br>
seconds 10-20 seconds, 10-30 seconds or 10-45 seconds. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, the time of residence in the extrusion process is at least 5-30<br>
seconds.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the temperature for extrusion may range from<br>
230F to 290F, from 255F to 275F or preferably from 265F to 268F. As discussed<br>
below, in embodiments wherein the feed comprises soybeans, the pressure is as<br>
above but the temperature range may be 300F to 350F, 325F to 340F, 325F to<br>
335F, 325F to 330F, 320F to 325F or 315F to 320F.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, there is provided a method of preparing<br>
an animal feed component comprising:<br>
grinding a quantity of a pulse product into a powder;<br>
mixing a quantity of intact (whole) oilseeds with the powder, thereby forming<br>
a mixture;<br>
subjecting the mixture to a temperature between about 230F to about 350F<br>
and a pressure of between about 200 psi to about 400 psi, thereby gelatinizing the<br>
mixture;<br>
extruding the mixture; and<br>
forming the extruded mixture into feed components.<br>
In most embodiments, peas are the preferred pulse crop for making the<br>
feed products. Specifically, peas have a higher level of absorbance and<br><br>
WO 2006/063444	PCT/CA2005/001892<br>
10<br>
encapsulate the oil that is released from the oil seeds. Peas need to be ground fine<br>
to expose as much starch as possible to accomplish this encapsulating.<br>
Specifically, pea starch is very absorbent and has a great wicking effect on fluids.<br>
The starch also keeps the oil in suspension under abrasive conditions.<br>
Alternatively, in those embodiments wherein soybeans are used, the<br>
mixture containing the soya bean is heated to a higher temperature, for example,<br>
300F-350F or more preferably from 325F to 335F, as discussed above, because<br>
soya has anti-nutritional factors that need to.be removed.<br>
One clear advantage of the invention is that the animal feed product<br>
produced thereby is substantially animal by-product free. As a result, the feed<br>
product is a competitor to feeds containing fishmeal or fish oil but is substantially or<br>
entirely animal by-product free .Aquatic product are considered animal by-<br>
products. Thus, in a preferred embodiment, the feed products described herein are<br>
essentially animal by-product free, that is, the feed products consist essentially of<br>
the pulse flour and oilseeds in combinations and ratios as described herein. That<br>
is, the feed components produced are characterized in that the feed components<br>
are substantially animal product-free or are entirely animal by-product-free.<br>
As discussed herein, the above-described feed components are added to a<br>
standard feed or substituted for a portion of a standard feed, generally from at<br>
least about 1% to about 40% of the standard feed or unsupplemented feed, or<br>
from at least about 5% to about 40% or from at least about 5% to about 30% or<br>
from at least about 5% to about 25% or from at least about 5% to about 20%. That<br>
is, in some embodiments, the above-described feed products comprise at least 1-<br>
40% of the feed ration of an animal.<br>
There is significant improvement in the digestibility of the fatty acids<br><br>
WO 2006/063444	PCT/CA2005/001892<br>
11<br>
because of the fact that they are free from the seed. The animal does not have to<br>
spend any energy to separate the oil from the other nutritional components. The<br>
other nutritional components have a higher level of digestibility because of the<br>
extrusion process discussed above.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided an extruded<br>
feed component comprising pulse flour and oilseed. In another aspect of the<br>
invention, there is provided an extruded feed component consisting essentially of<br>
pulse flour and oilseed. Preferably, the extruded feed component is substantially<br>
animal product free.<br>
As used herein, "animal" or "feed animal" refers to but is by no means<br>
limited to animals typically raised for meat production and/or production of other<br>
products, for example, eggs and milk, which are referred to collectively as "animal<br>
products" or "edible animal products". These include but are by no means limited<br>
to poultry such as chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese and the like, cattle, swine,<br>
goats, rabbits, deer, caribou, bison and the like.<br>
As shown in the examples, feeding animals feed components prepared<br>
according to the invention resulted in increases in omega-3 levels of from 1.5-5<br>
fold, 1.5-4 fold, or 2-4 fold in eggs compared to eggs from hens fed only the<br>
standard feed. Furthermore, chicken breast meat had increased omega-3 levels of<br>
from 1.5-6 fold, or from 1.5-5 fold, or from 1.5-3 fold or from 2-3 fold, or from 2-5<br>
fold or from 2-6 fold. As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, control<br>
animals are kept under similar conditions and are of similar or the same breeds<br>
and are used for comparison purposes. Similarly, omega3 levels in milk were<br>
increased 1.5-3 fold or 2.5-3 fold or 2-3 fold from cows fed the feed pellets of the<br>
instant invention. CLA levels were also increased 1.5-2 fold.<br><br>
WO 2006/063444	PCT/CA2005/001892<br>
12<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, there is provided a method of<br>
increasing the amount of omega-3 fatty acids or CLA in an edible animal product<br>
comprising:<br>
feeding a feed animal a standard feed ration wherein at least 1-40% of the<br>
feed ration is replaced by a feed prepared by<br>
grinding a quantity of a pulse product into a powder;<br>
mixing a quantity of intact oilseeds with the powder, thereby forming<br>
a mixture;<br>
subjecting the mixture to a temperature between about 230F to about<br>
350F and a pressure of between about 200 psi to about 400 psi, thereby<br>
gelatinizing the mixture;<br>
extruding the mixture; and<br>
forming the mixture into feed components; and<br>
harvesting the edible animal product from the animal, characterized in that<br>
the edible animal product has at least 1.5-5 fold increased omega3 levels or at<br>
least 1.5-2 fold increased CLA levels compared to an edible animal product<br>
harvested from a similar animal fed a standard feed ration.<br>
The invention will now be further illustrated by way of examples. However,<br>
the invention is not limited to the examples.<br>

In one example, to achieve the desired omega values in the end products,<br>
for example, eggs, poultry meat and pork, 50% flax and 50% peas are combined<br>
and extruded as discussed above. After extrusion, the following fatty acid profile is<br>
achieved:<br>
1.	total fat [ee]%= 20.25<br>
2.	total saturated %= 9.0<br>
3.total unsaturated %= 91.0<br>
4.	munic C 14:0% = .05<br>
5.	palmitic 16:%= 5.79%<br>

7.oleic c 18:1%=19.0<br>
8. linoleic c 18:2%=14.3<br>
9.alfa linolenic c 18:3% =57.0<br>
This type of profile achieved omega-3 numbers in broiler chicken boneless<br>
and skinless breast and thighs that on a normal basis are 4.50% to 10.85%, as<br>
discussed below. This has been achieved by feeding 10% feed components as<br>
described above that has been balanced in a normal diet. The other nutritional<br>
properties are used as part of the diet balancing.<br>
In trials with eggs, 15% feed component as described above achieved an<br>
improvement of omega-3 levels from 140 mg from a 50 gram egg to 570 mg from<br>
the same size of egg, as described below.<br>
Milk trials indicate an improvement from 0.34% of omega-3 to 0.96%.<br>
Furthermore, as shown in Tables 1-3, when fed to broiler chickens, the feed<br>
component as described above resulted in increased omega-3 levels in the breast<br>
meat (TABLE 1), leg meat (TABLE 2) and cavity/body fat (TABLE 3) of chickens 1-<br>
4. It is of note that chickens 1-6 were raised in one barn while chickens 7-12 were<br>
raised in a second barn, indicating that the differences are not strictly<br>
environmental. Clearly, use of the feed as described above resulted in an increase<br>
of omega-3 levels in breast meat from 2-3% to 8-10.5%. Furthermore, the fat on<br>
the breast meat was white or slightly yellow, that is, normal, regardless of the feed<br>
used.<br>
Furthermore, omega-3 concentration per 100 grams of yolk (TABLE 4) was<br>
also increased, from approximately 2.5 grams in the control to 7-8.5 grams in eggs<br>
from hens fed the above-described feed. Similarly, the Omega 3 concentration per<br>
19.5 grams yolk in a 50 gram egg was also increased from 0.48 grams to 1.4-1.7<br><br>
WO 2006/063444	PCT/CA2005/001892<br>
16<br>
grams (TABLE 5).<br>
As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, other suitable feed formulas<br>
described herein will produce similar results.<br>
Thus, in another aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of<br>
increasing the omega-3 or DHA or CLA (Conjugated Linoleic Acid) content of an<br>
animal product comprising feeding an animal a feed component composed of<br>
pulse flour and oilseed and then harvesting the animal product, for example, eggs,<br>
milk, meat or the like.<br>
In another example, seven cows in the University of Saskatchewan dairy<br>
herd were housed in tie-stalls and fed a feed ration including 1.5 kg of the above-<br>
described feed daily for 14 days. Milk samples were collected and composited on<br>
each of the last two days. These two samples were sub-sampled and sent to the<br>
Provincial Dairy Lab for analysis. The remaining daily samples were divided and<br>
the four resulting samples analyzed for fatty acid Content by three methods: the<br>
Feng method, which is a recent one developed specifically for milk; the Bligh and<br>
Dyer method, developed in the 1950s for fish and animal tissue lipid extraction;<br>
and the Ros-Gottlieb method which is also used for animal tissue.<br>
The average daily milk production was approximately 50 kg from cows that<br>
were 60 to 80 days in milk. The complete fatty acid analysis by the three methods<br>
is shown in Table 6. As can be seen, agreement among methods was good but the<br>
Ros-Gottleib method failed to detect some of the longer chain unsaturates.<br>
Results of the Feng method are summarized in Table 7 and are compared<br>
to a recent paper by H. Petit (2005, J Dairy Sci 88: 1755). The CLA content of 1%<br>
of recovered fatty acids is almost twice the control ration amount reported by Petit<br>
and appreciably higher than the 0.77% when Petit fed 12% flax seed., Previous<br><br>
WO 2006/063444	PCT/CA2005/001892<br>
17<br>
analysis of cows fed' the standard feed ration without the above-described feed<br>
returned CLA content that ranged from 0.5% to 0.7% of fatty acids.<br>
Thus, supplementing the standard feed with the above-described feed<br>
resulted in a substantial increase in milk CLA content. Vaccinic acid is produced by<br>
rumen bacteria and converted to CLA after absorption. The level in cows fed a<br>
feed ration supplemented with the above-described feed is higher. However, some<br>
of the trans C18 isomers are strongly associated with milk fat depression. As<br>
shown in Table 6, cows in the example had 1.12% transvaccenic acid in their milk<br>
indicating that milk fat percentage may be lower.<br>
Alpha linolenic acid is the main fatty acid in flax oil. The above-described<br>
feed resulted in a level above the Petit control (CONTROL) and 76% of that of<br>
cows fed 12% flax seed (12% FLAX).<br>
The Omega-6 (3.52) to Omega-3 (0.95) ratio is 3.69. This is in the desirable<br>
range and much more favorable than the 10 or greater ratio found in many feeds.<br>
As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, as used herein, omega-3 fatty acids<br>
include 18:3cis-9,12,15; 20:3cis-11,14,17; 20:5cis-5,8,11,14,17; 22:5cis-<br>
7,10,13,16,19; and 22:6cis-4,7,10,13,16,19. Omega-6 fatty acids include 18:2cis-<br>
9,12; 18:3cis-6,9,12; 20:2cis-11,14; 20:3cis-8,11,14; 20:4cis-5,8,11,14; 22:2cis-<br>
13,16;and22:4cis-7,10,13,16.<br>
In another example, 23 cows of the University of Saskatchewan dairy herd<br>
were fed standard feed to which 1.5 kg of the above-described feed was added<br>
daily. This ration was fed for four months, since calving. Milk samples were<br>
collected and composited on two days. The samples were sub sampled and sent<br>
to the Provincial Dairy Lab for analysis. The remaining daily samples were divided<br>
and the four resulting samples were analyzed for fatty acid content as described<br><br>
WO 2006/063444	PCT/CA2005/001892<br>
18<br>
above.<br>
Six of the cows were fed increasing levels of the above-described feed<br>
replacing concentrate in the standard feed (high group TMR). The target was 3.0<br>
kg daily, however feed intake increased and the amount of the above-described<br>
feed was allowed to reach an average of 3.5 kg per cow daily. These cows were<br>
60 to 100 days post calving. Milk samples were collected after 14 days of feeding<br>
the higher level of the above-described feed and composited for all six cows.<br>
Two litres of Dairyworld™ 3.25% fat milk was sub sampled and submitted to<br>
the Provincial Dairy Lab and analyzed for fatty acids in the Animal Science lab by<br>
the Bligh and Dyer method for comparison purposes.<br>
Milk yield of the 23 cows fed 1.5 kg of the above-described feed averaged<br>
41.6 kg (3.08% fat) on the days milk samples were collected. The six cows fed 3.5<br>
kg of the above-described feed averaged 51.1 kg of 3.42% fat milk, or 1.75 kg of<br>
milk fat daily. The Dairyworld milk fat analysis by the provincial lab was 3.22%.<br>
The complete fatty acid analysis of milk from cows fed 1.5 and 3.5 kg of the<br>
above-described feed are summarized in Table 8. In Table 9, results are compared<br>
to Petit, as discussed above. As can be seen, the CLA content of 1% of recovered<br>
fatty acids is almost twice the control ration amount reported by Petit and<br>
appreciably higher than the 0.77% when Petit fed 12% flax seed. As discussed<br>
above, prior analysis showed that cows fed the standard ration had CLA<br>
production between 0.5%-0.7% of fatty acids. Dairyworld milk had approximately<br>
0.67% CLA.<br>
Thus, the above-described feed clearly resulted in a substantial increase in<br>
milk CLA content.<br>
Feeding 3.5 kg of the above-described feed maintained milk fat percentage<br><br>
WO 2006/063444	PCT/CA2005/001892<br>
19<br>
at 3.42% (Table 10) in cows producing 51.1 kg milk and 1.75 kg of fat daily. This is<br>
higher than when cows were fed 1.5 kg of the above-described feed when milk fat<br>
percentage was reduced when a lower than intended level of forage was fed.<br>
Alpha linolenic acid is the main fatty acid in flax oil and the above-described feed<br>
resulted in a level above the Petit control an that of cows fed 12% flax seed.<br>
Dairyworld milk contained about 90% of the level when 1.5 kg of the above-<br>
described feed was used compared to 78% of the level when 3.5 kg was used.<br>
The amounts of EPA, DPA and DHA are low with no increase when 3.5 kg was<br>
fed. Dairyworld milk contained trace amounts of DHA. Based on the Bligh and<br>
Dyer method, cows fed 1.5 kg of the above-described feed component produced<br>
milk with 1.02% omega-3 fatty acids in the milk fat. This means that one litre of<br>
milk containing 3.42% fat would yield 315 mg of omega-3 fatty acids, or 78 mg in a<br>
250 ml serving. This is 1.2 times the amount found in Dairyworld milk fat as.<br>
currently marketed. These amounts are a significant contribution to the estimated<br>
daily need for 110 to 160 mg per day.<br>
Table 11 shows the omega-6 to omega-3 ratio to be 3.31 when 1.5 kg of the<br>
above-described feed ration was fed and 3.15 when 3.5 kg was fed.<br>
Thus, feeding the above-described feed component to cows resulted in<br>
increased concentrations of CLA, alpha-linolenic and DHA in milk fat.<br>
In addition, as part of this experiment, milk collected from the cows fed 1.5<br>
kg of the feed component daily was sampled 14 days after the feed component<br>
had been discontinued. As can be seen in Table 14, discontinuing the above-<br>
described feed component resulted in a reduction of the levels of several fatty<br>
acids, including CLA (0.99 to 0.51), α-linolenic (0.75 to 0.49), EPA (0.06 to 0.05),<br>
DPA (0.12 to 0.08) and most strikingly, DHA (0.10 to 0.00). This data clearly shows<br><br>
WO 2006/063444	PCT/CA2005/001892<br>
20<br>
that the above-described feed component increases the levels of several important<br>
fatty acids. Furthermore, DHA levels are greatly increased, because once the feed<br>
component is removed, DHA levels return to below the detectable levels.<br>
In another example, the effects of the above-described extrusion process on<br>
rumen protected (bypassed or undegraded) dry matter, starch, fat, protein and<br>
non-protein-starch-fat component. In this example, rumen degradation<br>
characteristics of the above-described feed mixture prior to extrusion and after<br>
extrusion were analyzed. Specifically, two Holstein dry cows fitted with a large<br>
rumen cannula with an internal diameter of 10 cm for measuring rumen<br>
degradation characteristics were housed at the experimental station in the<br>
University of Saskatchewan. Ruminal degradation characteristics were determined<br>
using the in situ method of Yu et al.<br>
The chemical composition of the two samples analyzed are shown in Table<br>
12. As can be seen, the feed contained dry matter from 91-95%, crude protein<br>
around 32%, crude fat around 18% and starch about 5%.<br>
The extrusion significantly increased rumen protected dry matter by 1.3<br>
times from 284 to 368 g/kg and significantly increased rumen protected protein by<br>
2 times from 84 to 166 g/kg dry matter or from 94 to 185 g/kg dry matter.<br>
Furthermore, extrusion significantly affected in situ rumen residue of fat at 0, 2, 4,<br>
24 and 48 hour incubation times, of starch at 2, 24 and 48 hours and of non-<br>
protein-starch-fat (NPSF) at 0, 2, 4,12, 24 and 48 hours.<br>
Thus, the extrusion process significantly improved by-pass dry matter and<br>
crude protein and shifted degradation of protein from the rumen to the small<br>
intestine.<br>
Specifically, in the case of dry matter, only 12% of the raw feed remained<br><br>
WO 2006/063444	PCT/CA2005/001892<br>
21<br>
after 12 hours of incubation, but at the same time point, 25% of the dry matter of<br>
the extruded feed remained in the nylon bag. Similarly, extrusion also greatly<br>
reduced the rate of protein degradation in the rumen. Initial protein solubility was<br>
reduced by extrusion and protein degradation was reduced greatly, increasing by-<br>
pass protein to about 55%. The effect of extrusion on starch was minimal.<br>
The reduced rate of dry matter and protein makes it unlikely that the above-<br>
described feed will contribute to rumen acidosis.<br>
In another example, egg-laying hens were fed the following diets:<br>
Group 1 (control) - Phase 1 Low Intake to 80 grams<br>
Group 2 - Group 1 diet including 10% flax<br>
Group 3 - Group 1 diet including 10% above-described feed<br>
Group 4 - Group 1 diet including 15% above-described feed<br>
Group 5 - Group 1 diet including 20% above-described feed<br>
Eggs were collected at three times and the omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acid<br>
contents of the eggs as well as the cholesterol content of the third set were<br>
analyzed. Specifically, approximately 5 g of yolk was used for extraction of the total<br>
lipids by the Bligh Dyer procedure described above. The total fat content was<br>
determined gravimetrically. Approximately 10 mg of lipids were transmethylated<br>
using 6% sulphuric acid in methanol and the individual fatty acid methyl esters<br>
determined on an Agilent 6890N gas chromatograph equipped with a 7683 auto<br>
sampler/injector. Cholesterol was performed using AOAC method 976.26.<br>
Table 13 reports the data for the three samples calculated on a 16.0 g yolk<br>
(the average weight of test yolks) and a 50 g egg.<br>
