				<td>Apparatus and method for determining the volume fractions<br>
of the phases in a suspension<br>
Description<br>
The present application relates to an apparatus and a<br>
method for determining the volume fractions of the phases<br>
in a suspension, i.e. a multi-phase mixture containing a<br>
liquid phase and a solid phase. In particular, the present<br>
invention is suited for determining the hematocrit value<br>
HKT of whole blood, i.e. the ratio of the partial volume of<br>
the cellular constituents to the overall volume.<br>
Methods for determining the hematocrit value HKT of blood<br>
are known from the prior art. One known method for<br>
determining the hematocrit value is based on an electrical<br>
conductance measurement, wherein the measured conductance<br>
is inversely proportional to the hematocrit. Such methods<br>
are described, for example, in "Labor und Diagnose" by<br>
Lothar Thomas, TH-Books, 5th volume, 1998, and K. Ddrner,<br>
"Klinische Chemie und Hamatologie", Georg Thieme Verlag,<br>
Stuttgart, Germany, 1998, 2003. Moreover, products for<br>
hematocrit determination using electrical conductance<br>
measurement were offered by iSTAT Corporation, East<br>
Windsor, NJ, USA (http://www.istat.com) at the time of<br>
application.<br>
A further method for determining the hematocrit value is<br>
referred to as micro-hematocrit method. Here, a micro-<br>
capillary having an internal diameter of 1 mm is dipped<br>
into the blood to be measured. The blood rises in the<br>
capillary, driven by the capillary force. This is now<br>
sealed at one end and inserted into a micro-hematocrit<br>
centrifuge or a microhematocrit rotor, and centrifuged<br>
according to the NCCLS standard. The determination of the<br>
hematocrit value HKT takes place either by a measurement<br>
disk or a measurement assembly. Direct readout of the<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
hematocrit value is possible still in the centrifuge with<br>
the measurement disk. The great disadvantage of this method<br>
is the necessary manual sealing of the capillary.<br>
The micro-hematocrit method is approved as a reference<br>
method, wherein the values obtained are up to about 2%<br>
higher than the comparative measurements with a hematology<br>
analyzer, due to the enclosed plasma. With respect to this<br>
micro-hematocrit method, for example, reference may be made<br>
to K. Dbrner, Klinische Chemie und Hamatologie, Georg<br>
Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart, Germany, 1998, 2003, or B. Bull<br>
et al., Pennsylvania, USA, ISBN 1-56238-413-9 (1994).<br>
Furthermore, this technology is practiced by the company<br>
Hermle Labortechnik GmbH at the time of application<br>
(http://www.hermle-labortechnik.de).<br>
Methods for filling blind channels, i.e. channels with one<br>
closed end, which are supposed to prevent enclosure of<br>
bubbles, are known from the prior art. Such methods are<br>
described, for example, in Steinert CP Sandmeier H, Daub<br>
M., de Heij B., Zengerle R. (2004), Bubble free priming of<br>
blind channels, in Proceedings of IEEE-MEMS, January 25 -<br>
29, 2004, Maastricht, The Netherlands, p. 224 - 228; and<br>
Goldschmidtboeing F., Woias P. (2005), Strategies for Void-<br>
free Liquid-filling of Micro Cavities, in Proceedings of<br>
Transducers '05 Conference, June 5-9, Seoul, Korea, ISBN<br>

B3.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide a<br>
novel concept for determining the volume fractions of the<br>
phases in a suspension, allowing for reliable results using<br>
small suspension volumes.<br>
This object is achieved by an apparatus according to claim<br>
1 as well as a method according to claim 13.<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
The present invention provides an apparatus for determining<br>
the volume fractions of the phases in a suspension,<br>
comprising:<br>
a body;<br>
a channel structure, which is formed in the body and<br>
comprises an inlet area and a blind channel, which is<br>
fluidically connected to and capable of being filled via<br>
the inlet area; and<br>
a drive means for imparting the body with rotation, so that<br>
phase separation of the suspension in the blind channel<br>
takes place by centrifugation,<br>
wherein the blind channel comprises such a channel cross-<br>
section and/or such wetting properties that, when filling<br>
same with the suspension via the inlet area, higher<br>
capillary forces act in a first cross-sectional area than<br>
in a second cross-sectional area, so that at first the<br>
first cross-sectional area fills in the direction from the<br>
inlet area toward the blind end of the blind channel and<br>
then the second cross-sectional area fills in the direction<br>
from the blind end toward the inlet area.<br>
The present invention further provides a method for<br>
determining the volume fractions of the phases in a<br>
suspension, comprising:<br>
providing a channel structure, which comprises an inlet<br>
area and a blind channel, which borders on the inlet area;<br>
introducing the suspension into the inlet area, wherein the<br>
blind channel comprises such a channel cross-section and/or<br>
such wetting properties that higher capillary forces act in<br>
a first cross-sectional area than in a second cross-<br>
sectional area, so that at first the first cross-sectional<br>
area fills in the direction from the inlet area toward the<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
blind end and then the second cross-sectional area fills in<br>
the direction from the blind end toward the inlet area; and<br>
imparting the channel structure with rotation, to cause<br>
phase separation of the suspension in the blind channel by<br>
centrifugation.<br>
The present invention relates to a novel concept to<br>
determine the volume fractions of the phases in a multi-<br>
phase mixture. The inventive concept here uses the effect<br>
of sedimentation in a blind channel if the same is<br>
subjected to centrifugation. The blind channel, according<br>
to the invention, includes such a channel cross-section<br>
and/or such wetting properties that an asymmetric capillary<br>
force occurs along the walls of the blind channel, which<br>
results in capillary filling of the channel preferably in<br>
the area of the high capillary forces. Thereby, air is<br>
displaced into the area of the low capillary force, and<br>
furthermore in the direction of the inlet. Thus, by a quick<br>
filling rate in the area of the high capillary forces, the<br>
associated cross-sectional area of the channel is quickly<br>
filled in the direction from the open side toward the<br>
closed side, whereupon the areas with the low capillary<br>
force are filled in the direction from the blind end toward<br>
the inlet. This allows for filling the blind channel<br>
substantially without air enclosure. The blind channel thus<br>
can be filled with the sample with defined and usually<br>
infinitesimal bubble enclosure due to the channel cross-<br>
section and/or the wetting properties. The blind channel is<br>
subjected to centrifugation, so that phase separation of<br>
the suspension takes place and the particles are sedimented<br>
out of the suspension.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the channel structure may<br>
comprise an integrated overflow structure between inlet and<br>
blind channel for integrated volume definition of the<br>
sample. In further embodiments, a scale for reading the<br>
volume fractions may be integrated in the body in which the<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
channel structure is formed. The body in which the channel<br>
structure is formed may be formed, in embodiments of the<br>
present invention, by a first layer, in which the channel<br>
structure is formed, and a second layer, which forms a lid.<br>
So as to cause asymmetric capillary forces along the walls<br>
of the blind channel, the blind channel may comprise walls<br>
bordering on each other at different enclosed angles.<br>
Additionally or alternatively, the walls may be differently<br>
hydrophilic with respect to the suspension or comprise<br>
portions being differently hydrophilic with respect to the<br>
suspension. Again alternatively or additionally, the blind<br>
channel may comprise a cross-section with at least one<br>
step, so that a capillary force distribution having areas<br>
with higher capillary force and areas with lower capillary<br>
force results across the cross-section of the blind<br>
channel.<br>
In the inventive method for determining the volume<br>
fractions of the phases in a suspension, the centrifugal<br>
force may further be used to effect accelerated filling of<br>
the blind channel. To this end, rotation of the channel<br>
structure may already be caused before the blind channel is<br>
completely filled.<br>
The present invention allows for complete integration of<br>
all procedural steps required for hematocrit value<br>
determination, particularly with no later sealing of a<br>
capillary being necessary. Furthermore,' the inventive<br>
apparatus may be produced via a simple process, since the<br>
body may simply consist of two layers, with the channel<br>
structure being structured in one thereof, whereas the<br>
other serves as a lid. Alternatively, both layers may be<br>
structured to define parts of the channel structure.<br>
The present invention may be implemented as a so-called<br>
"lab-on-a-disk" system, wherein further medical tests may<br>
be integrated on the body, also taking advantage of<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
centrifugal and capillary forces as well as further forces<br>
usual in so-called lab-on-a-chip systems. The present<br>
invention is particularly suited for determining the<br>
hematocrit value of blood, wherein the dimensions of the<br>
channel structure are adapted correspondingly, to be able<br>
to effect sedimentation of the blood into erythrocytes and<br>
plasma in the blind channel. Lab-on-a-chip systems are<br>
described, for example, in A. van den Berg, E. Oosterbroek,<br>
Amsterdam, NL, ISBN 0-444-51100-8 (2003).<br>
The blind channel is designed for capillary filling with<br>
the suspension the volume fractions of which are to be<br>
determined, wherein filling thus may take place without<br>
centrifugal force. The centrifugal force may, however, be<br>
used supportively to accelerate the filling process by<br>
imparting the channel structure with rotation during<br>
filling.<br>

inventive apparatus.<br>
The present invention is generally suited for determining<br>
the volume fractions of the phases in a multi-phase<br>
mixture, and is particularly applicable in advantageous<br>
manner for determining the hematocrit value of blood.<br>
Substantially, the present invention includes a body and a<br>
drive means for imparting the body with rotation. The body<br>
may for example comprise a lidded substrate, in which<br>
channel structures are implemented, and may be set to<br>
rotation via a rotation motor. Here, the body may either<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
itself be formed as a rotation body, for example a disk,<br>
which is placed onto a suitable coupling of the rotation<br>
motor, or the body may be formed as a module insertable<br>
into a rotor, which can be driven by a rotation motor. What<br>
is important for technical realization rather is the<br>
balance of the rotor than the exact shape of the body.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a schematic top view onto an excerpt 10 of a<br>
substrate, which may for example be implemented as a disk<br>
12, as it is shown in Fig. 10A. The substrate 12 may be<br>
constructed according to a conventional CD type, having a<br>
center opening 14, by means of which it may for example be<br>
attached at a conventional centrifuge. An alternative<br>
embodiment of a substrate 12', in which a plurality of<br>
channel structures are formed, which hence has a plurality<br>
of areas 10, is shown in Fig. 10B. By the substrate shown<br>
in Fig. 10B, in which five channel structures are formed,<br>
the hematocrit value of five blood samples can be<br>
determined concurrently or also successively.<br>
As can be taken from Fig. 11, the substrate 12, in which<br>
the channel structures are formed, are provided with a lid<br>
16. The substrate 12 and the lid 16 form a module body 18.<br>
The module body 18 is attached via a mounting means 20 to a<br>
rotating part 22 of a driving device, which is pivoted on a<br>
stationary part 24 of the driving device. The driving<br>
device may for example be a conventional centrifuge with<br>
adjustable rotational speed or also a CD or DVD drive. The<br>
driving device 24 includes a control means 26 to cause the<br>
respective rotations of the substrate 12 to perform the<br>
method according to the invention.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, a channel structure in the substrate<br>
comprises an inlet area 30 for the medium to be examined,<br>
which borders on a blind channel. The substrate 12 is<br>
rotatable about a rotation axis Z, so that the inlet area<br>
terminates radially outwardly into the blind channel 32. In<br>
the inlet area, for example, there is a hole 34 in the lid<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
of the substrate, as indicated by dashed lines in Fig. 1. A<br>
sample may be introduced into the inlet area through the<br>
hole.<br>
The channel structure includes, in the example shown, also<br>
an overflow structure 36, which comprises an overflow<br>
channel 38 and an overflow chamber 40, into which the<br>
overflow channel 38 leads. The overflow structure 36 serves<br>
for volume dosage of the sample, i.e. of the suspension.<br>
The overflow channel 38 of the overflow structure may<br>
represent a hydrophobic barrier for the dosage, which is<br>
overcome after the filling of the blind channel 32, so that<br>
a defined volume of the suspension is in the blind channel<br>
32.<br>
In the embodiment shown, the substrate 12 further includes<br>
a scale 42, which may for example be formed on or in the<br>
lid or on the upper side of the carrier layer 16. The scale<br>
42 allows for direct optical readout of the volume of the<br>
phase fraction following the sedimentation.<br>
The blind channel 32 is formed such that different<br>
capillary forces act in different cross-sectional areas<br>
thereof. In particular, the blind channel may be formed to<br>
obtain differently strong capillary forces along the edges<br>
of the channel. To this end, an angle of inclination of the<br>
sidewalls of the channel with respect to a perpendicular to<br>
the main surfaces of the substrate and/or the contact angle<br>
of the inner channel wall with the suspension to be<br>
sedimented can be adapted. In particular, zones with<br>
increased capillary pressure may be generated thereby,<br>
wherein the expansion of the menisci at the greatest speed<br>
then is along the zones with the increased capillary<br>
pressure.<br>
According to a first alternative, as it is schematically<br>
shown in Fig. 2, the walls of the blind channel and/or the<br>
walls of the entire channel structure (inlet and blind<br><br>
- 10 -<br>
channel) may be inclined by an angle a. By such an<br>
inclination a, a differently high capillary pressure at<br>
edges kl and k2 of the channel results, wherein a sidewall<br>
46 and an upper wall 44 border on each other with a smaller<br>
enclosed angle at the edge kl than the sidewall 46 with a<br>
channel bottom wall 48 at the edge k2. Thus, there is a<br>
higher capillary force in the area of the edge kl than in<br>
the area of the edge k2. The area adjacent to the edge kl<br>
thus represents an area of a higher capillary force, at<br>
which propagation of the meniscus of a suspension with<br>
which the channel is to be filled takes place at increased<br>
speed. Thus, it can be achieved that filling at first takes<br>
place in these areas in the direction from the inlet area<br>
toward the blind end, and the remaining areas then fill in<br>
the direction from the blind end toward the inlet area.<br>
Variations of channel cross-sections are shown in Figs. 3A<br>
- 3F, wherein the channel each is formed in the substrate<br>
12, which is provided with a lid 16. In Figs. 3A - 3C, T<br>
channel cross-sections are shown, the sidewalls of which<br>
exhibit increasingly greater angles of inclination from<br>
Fig. 3A to 3C. An increased angle of inclination a of one<br>
and/or more channel walls increases the asymmetry of the<br>
capillary pressure.<br>
In Figs. 3D - 3F, trapezoidal channel cross-sections are<br>
shown, the sidewalls of which have increasingly higher<br>
angles of inclination from Fig. 3D - 3F, and hence<br>
increasingly higher asymmetry of the capillary force.<br>
The channel cross-sections shown in Figs. 3A - 3C here<br>
represent a preferred embodiment, since they allow for more<br>
reliable bubble-free filling. The described cross-sections<br>
are advantageous in that they can be produced in<br>
technically simple manner by usual milling tools.<br>
Alternatively to the "oblique" T shapes shown in Figs. 3A -<br>
3C, the channel cross-section could also have a T shape<br><br>
- 11 -<br>
with substantially straight side faces, so that the channel<br>
has steps defining cross-sectional areas in which there are<br>
different capillary forces, so that substantially bubbly-<br>
free filling is possible thereby.<br>
As a further alternative, differently strong capillary<br>
pressures in the channel edges can be realized by variation<br>
of the contact angle 9. In this respect, Fig. 4A<br>
schematically shows an edge k3 of a channel the channel<br>
walls of which are made hydrophilic with respect to the<br>
suspension to be filled, such that a great contact angle 6<br>
is present. Thereby, a high capillary force results in the<br>
area of the edge k3. In contrast thereto, the channel walls<br>
at the edge k4 shown in Fig. 4B are made hydrophilic with<br>
respect to the suspension to be filled, such that a small<br>
contact angle 9 results. Thereby, there is a smaller<br>
contact angle in the area of the edge k4.<br>
According to Figs. 4A and 4B, bubble-free filling of the<br>
hydrophilic blind channel thus may also take place based on<br>
the preferred capillary filling along a certain part of the<br>
channel wall by variation of the contact angle 9, wherein<br>
the case shown in Fig. 4A provides a capillary filling<br>
preferred over the case shown in Fig. 4B. An increased<br>
angle of inclination a of the channel wall may additionally<br>
increase the asymmetry of the capillary force. For example,<br>
it is possible to make the inside of the lid 16 more<br>
strongly hydrophilic than the walls of the substrate 12, so<br>
that a capillary force occurring on the edges between the<br>
lid 16 and the substrate 12 is increased as opposed to a<br>
capillary force occurring in an area on the edges between<br>
the sidewalls and the channel bottom. Furthermore, wall<br>
sections of individual walls may be made more strongly<br>
hydrophilic than others so as to there create areas at<br>
which a higher capillary force occurs than in other areas,<br>
so as to obtain the functionality described.<br><br>
- 12 -<br>
In summary, it can be stated that the capillary force in<br>
different cross-sectional areas of the blind channel is<br>
determined by the geometrical angles and the wetting<br>
angles, so that the effect of the blind channel at first<br>
being filled in the direction from the open end toward the<br>
blind end in certain areas and the remaining areas then<br>
being filled in the direction from the blind or closed end<br>
toward the open end can be achieved by a corresponding<br>
configuration of the channel cross-section using acute<br>
angles or sufficient hydrophylization. In other words,<br>
filling with a fast filling rate takes place in the areas<br>
with increased capillary force, whereas filling with a slow<br>
filling rate takes place in the areas with a low capillary<br>
force.<br>
With respect to the theory of such a bubble-free filling<br>
capability of blind channels and/or their design, reference<br>
is made to the documents cited above, the disclosures of<br>
which in this respect are incorporated by reference.<br>
A perspective view of a channel structure having a channel<br>
cross-section substantially corresponding to the cross-<br>
section shown in Fig. 3A is shown in Fig. 5. The channel<br>
cross-section has a T shape, the sidewalls of which have an<br>
angle of inclination a of about 17.5°. At the closed end 60<br>
of the blind channel, which is generally designated with<br>
the reference numeral 62, there is a transition area. In<br>
the channel structure shown in Fig. 5, the outer areas of<br>
the crossbeam of the T structure, which are schematically<br>
marked in Fig. 3A and designated with the reference numeral<br>
64, represent areas with increased capillary pressure.<br>
Thus, filling takes place from the open side of the blind<br>
channel 62 along these areas toward the closed end, as<br>
shown by an arrow 66 in Fig. 5. At the closed end 60, there<br>
is provided a transition so as to assist transition of the<br>
suspension into the inner area not yet filled, which is<br>
designated with the reference numeral 68 in Fig. 3A. This<br>
is indicated by an arrow 67 in Fig. 5. Subsequently, the<br><br>
- 13 -<br>
blind channel fills further in the direction from the blind<br>
end 60 toward the open end, as indicated by an arrow 68 in<br>
Fig. 5.<br>
In the case of a purely capillary filling, the transition<br>
area 62 is formed such that the capillary flow is not<br>
interrupted there. An important measure to this end, for<br>
example, is the avoidance of sharp transition edges. If<br>
this final phase of the capillary filling is assisted by<br>
centrifugation, geometries that can be filled not solely in<br>
capillary manner are also tolerable in the.area 62, without<br>
putting the overall functionality of the blind-channel-<br>
based hematocrit determination at risk.<br>
Channel structures, for example such as it is shown in Fig.<br>
5, may for example be produced using a CNC (computer<br>
numerically controlled) micro-material treatment in a COC<br>
(cyclic olefin copolymer) disk using a tapering tool,<br>
yielding walls having an inclination of 17.5°. The upper<br>
and the lower plane of the two-plane capillary structure<br>
shown in Fig. 5 may for example have a depth of 400 pm,<br>
widths of 1400 pm and 400 pm, respectively, and radial<br>
lengths of 25 mm and 25.4 mm, respectively, with a<br>
transition at the closed end 60, as explained above.<br>
The inner channel walls are made hydrophilic with respect<br>
to the suspension to be examined after producing the<br>
channel, due to the substrate material used, or are made<br>
hydrophilic correspondingly after producing the channel<br>
structures.<br>
A sequence representing the filling of a blind channel, as<br>
it is shown in Figs. 3A and 5, is shown in Figs. 6A - 6F,<br>
wherein 6A - 6C show lateral longitudinal cross-sectional<br>
views, whereas Figs. 6D - 6F illustrate top views onto the<br>
channel structure shown in Fig. 5. The filling illustrated<br>
takes place without centrifugal force assistance, wherein a<br>
time axis at the left edge of Figs. 6A to 6C indicates that<br><br>
- 14 -<br>
the filling process up to the degree of filling shown in<br>
Figs. 6C and 6F takes about 30 seconds.<br>
As can be seen in Fig. 6, the blind channel 62 is<br>
structured into a substrate 70 and closed by means of a lid<br>
72. As explained with reference to Figs. 4A and 5, the<br>
channel possesses areas 64 in which there is increased<br>
capillary force and areas 68 in which there is lower<br>
capillary force.<br>
Upon introducing a suspension into an inlet area (not shown<br>
in Figs. 6A - 6F) , which is fluidically connected to the<br>
blind channel 62 at the open end, the suspension is drawn<br>
along the critical edges between the inclined sidewalls and<br>
the lid by the capillary force, as shown by the suspension<br>
areas 74 in Figs. 6A and 6D and indicated by the arrow 76<br>
in Fig. 6A. After filling the areas 64 in the direction<br>
from the open end toward the closed end of the blind<br>
channel 62, the special shape of the closed end assists a<br>
seamless transition of the suspension into the area 68<br>
along the edges, as can be seen in Figs. 6B and 6E. This<br>
transition into the area 68 is further supported by the<br>
fact that the edges at the closed end of the blind<br>
capillaries are rounded. Then, filling of the still<br>
unfilled area 68 in the direction from the closed end 60 of<br>
the blind channel 62 toward the open end thereof takes<br>
place. This leads to complete evacuation of the channel, so<br>
that this has substantially been filled completely by the<br>
suspension without bubble inclusion.<br>
Execution of an example of an inventive method using a<br>
channel structure having a channel 62, as it was described<br>
above, is shown in Figs. 7A - 7C. The channel structure<br>
includes the blind channel 62, an inlet area 80, as well as<br>
an overflow structure 82. The channel structures mentioned<br>
may again be formed in a substrate and covered by a lid,<br>
which may again comprise an opening 84 for introducing a<br><br>
- 15 -<br>
suspension into the inlet area 80, which may represent an<br>
inlet reservoir.<br>
In Fig. 7A, there is shown the state in which the blind<br>
channel 62 is completely filled with the suspension to be<br>
sedimented. After this filling, the rotational frequency is<br>
increased over the breakthrough frequency of an overflow<br>
channel 86 of the overflow structure 82, which is made<br>
hydrophobic at the entry, so that the excess suspension is<br>
drawn off into the overflow reservoir 88 via the overflow<br>
channel 86. Fig. 7B shows the channel structure after<br>
dosing off the excess suspension using the overflow<br>
structure 82. The limiting frequency for the breakthrough<br>
may for example be 30 Hz, wherein the suspension volume in<br>
the blind capillary 62 may for example be 20 pi. Then, the<br>
substrate in which the channel structure is formed is<br>
further subjected to rotation, for example at 100 Hz for<br>
five minutes, so that the suspension in the blind channel<br>
62 is sedimented. Fig. 7C shows the channel structure after<br>
sedimentation. The volume fraction of the deposited<br>
sediment and/or the hematocrit value may then be determined<br>
at rest via the ratio of the radial position of the liquid-<br>
solid interface and the known length of the capillary.<br>
Preferably, a scale 90 located on the substrate may be used<br>
for reading the hematocrit value.<br>
Fig. 8 shows a possible frequency protocol for operating<br>
the driving device, for example the rotation motor. At the<br>
beginning, the rotational frequency is increased to 100 Hz,<br>
for example, wherein the centrifugal force generated hereby .<br>
may assist the filling process. After exceeding the<br>
limiting frequency of the overflow structure, the excess<br>
suspension flows into the suspension reservoir 88. So as to<br>
cause sedimentation of the suspension in the blind channel,<br>
rotation at a substantially constant rotational speed takes<br>
place, whereupon the rotation is terminated by breaking<br>
over a certain time interval. After the standstill, the<br><br>
- 16 -<br>
volume fraction can be read using the scale by an operator<br>
or automatically via an optical detection means.<br>
Fig. 9 shows the result of a measurement series for<br>
determining the hematocrit value, which was obtained using<br>
the above-described apparatus and with the described<br>
method. The reference determination here takes place with<br>
the aid of a micro-hematocrit rotor Z 233 M-2 of the<br>
company Hermle Labortechnik in a centrifuge by the same<br>
company.<br>
Fig. 9 shows that a CV value of 2.1% and high linearity<br>
between the inventively obtained hematocrit value and the<br>
reference measurement, R2 = 0.999, was obtained in a<br>
determination time of five to six minutes.<br>
Hence, the present invention provides a novel concept<br>
suited for determining a centrifuge-based hematocrit test<br>
in a blind capillary. The test may be implemented by a<br>
frequency protocol on a simple two-plane structure, which<br>
may easily be achieved using inexpensive mass production,<br>
for example injection molding. The test is very exact and<br>
requires a blood volume of only 20 pi. Moreover, readout by<br>
visual inspection on a printed scale eliminates the need<br>
for expensive detection equipment, wherein the hematocrit<br>
test could in principle be run on a conventional CD drive.<br>
So as to achieve rotational symmetry of the disk, it may<br>
further be advantageous to implement parallelization of<br>
channels, as it was explained above with reference to Fig.<br>
10B, which is of particularly advantage for routine blood<br>
separation.<br>
In embodiments of the present invention, there may further<br>
be provided a possibility to allow for readout during or<br>
after the rotation. To this end, a suitable measurement<br>
instrument may be provided. This may for example comprise a<br>
photo camera with short aperture time or a stroboscopic<br>
camera, to detect the blind channel, with an associated<br><br>
- 17 -<br>
scale if required. The measurement instrument may further<br>
comprise an evaluation means to evaluate the captured<br>
images and determine the hematocrit value therefrom.<br>
The substrate in which the channel structures are formed<br>
may be formed of any suitable materials, for example<br>
plastics, silicon, metal or the like. Furthermore, the<br>
substrate and the structures formed therein may be produced<br>
by suitable manufacturing methods, for example micro-<br>
structuring or injection molding techniques. The lid of the<br>
inventive substrate may consist of a suitable, preferably<br>
transparent material, for example glass of pyrex glass.<br>
With reference to the preferred embodiments, the body of<br>
substrate and lid has been described as a rotation body<br>
with a rotation axis, wherein the drive means is formed to<br>
rotate the rotation body about its rotation axis.<br>
Alternatively, the body may have a substantially arbitrary<br>
shape, wherein the drive means comprises a fixture for<br>
holding the body and for rotating the substrate about a<br>
rotation axis lying outside the substrate.<br><br>
