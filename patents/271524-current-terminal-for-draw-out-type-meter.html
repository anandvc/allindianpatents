				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>A)	TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] The present invention generally relates to electrical devices such as draw out type meters, relays, instrument transformers like current transformers. The present invention particularly relates to the electrical terminals in meters, relays, current transformers, etc., and more particularly to shorting links in meters, relays.<br>
B)	BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The shorting links are provided in meters/relays used in electrical power distribution systems. When the load is removed from a current transformer which remains coupled to an active power circuit, the voltage in the secondary winding of the transformer will soar and may saturate the CTs, which will result in malfunctioning. Accordingly, shorting blocks are used to provide a path for the current in the secondary winding to circulate.<br>
[0003] During the manufacture or assembly of an electrical connector, it is often necessary to short two or more pins or contacts together so that the pins or contacts are attached to an earth lead through a single connection which is formed by soldering the rear end of each pin or socket contact which is to be shorted. But this method of shorting is laborious and the resulting network of junctions formed at the rear end of the insulating connector may obstruct the connections of the other leads to the individual unshorted plug pins or socket contacts.<br><br>
[0004] The currently available draw out type meter or relays has a shorting link so that the current terminals that feed current to the module should get shorted automatically to prevent damage to the current transformers, when a draw out module is removed. All known designs of such products use a pair of terminals for feeding current and another pair of spring loaded contacts to short the path when draw out module is removed. A plastic rib is normally used to operate the shorting link.<br>
[0005] The US patent 5994989 discloses an electrical shorting block for an electrical power distribution system. The shorting block has a molded member provided with recesses to receive the terminals having the apertures. A shorting bar is extended across the terminal members and is provided with apertures that are aligned with the apertures in the terminals. The shorting connectors are received in the apertures. The biased by the compression springs to move away from the terminals during non use period.<br>
[0006] The US patent 4225839 discloses a current transformer encapsulated in an injection molded layer and provided with inverted U shaped shorting bar so that the central portion of the bar is rotatably mounted on the upper portion of the central support.<br>
[0007] The US patent 5061 196 discloses a shorting link provided with legs that interlock with the contacts of an electrical connector. The contacts may be connected by the links to the ground.<br><br>
[0008] The US patent 5248 953 discloses a thermal overload protection device for electronic components used in telecommunication and data transmission fields. The overload device has a spring elastic shorting link and a melting element so that the shorting link is tripped based on the fusing process of the melting element.<br>
[0009] Thus none of the draw out type meters, relays and current transformers is provided with a compact, cheap and reliable shorting link. Hence there is a need to develop a current terminal with a built in shorting link to provide a compact and cost effective shorting link for the draw out type meter and relays.<br>
C) OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0010] The primary object of the invention is to develop a built-in shorting link for current terminals in the draw out type meter or relay.<br>
[0011] Another object of the invention is to provide a single contact assembly for connectors and shorting link.<br>
[0012] Yet another object of the invention is to develop a shorting link for make-before-break contacts in draw out type energy meters.<br>
[0013] Yet another object of the invention is to develop a draw out type energy meter with built in contact link for contact terminals thereby reducing the cost and space.<br><br>
[0014] Yet another object of the invention is to develop a compact shorting link to reduce the size and cost of the device.<br>
[0015] These and other objects and advantages of the present invention will become readily apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
D) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0016] The above mentioned shortcomings, disadvantages and problems are addressed herein and which will be understood by reading and studying the following specification.<br>
[0017] The various embodiments of the invention provide a current terminal with additional shorting finger for energy meter to short the current terminals when the energy meter is in removed condition.<br>
[0018] According to one embodiment of the present invention, a draw out type meter is provided with a pair of current terminals in a complimentary mode. An additional finger is added to one side of the current terminals. When the current terminals are mounted in complementary mode, the additional fingers attached to the current terminals are made to contact each other to act as the shorting link. When the energy meter is mounted on the panel, the current terminals are engaged with the female terminals provided in the panel to complete the circuit. An insulator provided in the meter is inserted between the additional fingers to prevent the shorting. The insulator provided between the male terminals on meter does the job of opening the shorting<br><br>
link. Thus the need for an additional pair of contacts and the plastic mechanism are eliminated thereby saving cost and space.<br>
