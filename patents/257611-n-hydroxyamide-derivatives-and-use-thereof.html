				<td>N-hydroxyamide derivatives and use thereof<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention is related to N-hydroxyamide derivatives of Formula (I), pharmaceutical composition thereof, methods of preparation thereof and to their use for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of autoimmune disorders and/or inflammatory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, respiratory diseases and fibrosis. Specifically, the present invention is related to N-hydroxyamide derivatives for the modulation, notably the inhibition of the activity or function of matrix metalloproteinases, especially gelatinases and metalloelastase.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Metal loproteinases are a superfamily of proteinases (enzymes) named for their dependence<br>
on a metal ion (zinc) in the active site.<br>
The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) form a metalloproteinase sub-family having as one of major biological function to catalyse the breakdown of connective tissue or extracellular matrix through their ability to hydrolyse various components of the tissue or matrix, such as collagens, gelatins, proteoglycans, fibronectins and elastin.<br>
The matrix metalloproteinase family is further divided according to their function and substrates (Visse al, 2003, Circ. Res., 92: 827-839) and comprises collagenases (MMP-1, MMP-8, MMP-13 and MMP-18), gelatinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9), stromelysins (MMP-3, MMP-10 and MMP-11), membrane-type MMPs (MT-MMP-1 to MT-MMP-6 and MMP-14, MMP-15, MMP-16, MMP-17, MMP-24 and MMP-25), matrilysins (MMP-7 and MMP-26) and other unclassified MMPs such as metal loelastase (MMP-12), enamelysin (MMP-20), epilysin (MMP-28), MMP-19, MMP-22 and MMP-23.<br>
Apart from their role in degrading connective tissue, MMPs are involved in the biosynthesis of TNF-alpha and in the post-translational proteolysis processing, or shedding<br>
of biologically important membrane proteins (Hooper et al., 1997, Biochem J., 321: 265-279). MMPs for example contribute to the local growth and spread of malignant lesions and therefore have been a target for anti-tumor drug development (Fingleton et al., 2003, Expert Opin. Ther. Targets, 7(3):385-397). Disorders such as inflammatory disorders like arthritis (Clark et al, 2003, Expert. Opin. Ther Targets, 7(1): 19-34), respiratory disorders such as emphysema, atherosclerosis (Galis et al, 2002, Circ. Res., 90:251-262), neurological disorders such as degenerative nervous system diseases, multiple sclerosis (Leppert et al, 2001, Brain Res. Rev., 36:249-257), periodontitis (Ingman et al, 1996, J. Clin. Periodontal, 23:127-1132), pre-term labor (Makratis et al, 2003, J. Matern Fetal &amp; Neonatal Medicine, 14(3): 170-6) and wound healing have been demonstrated to be associated with MMPs expression and/or activity.<br>
A wide variety of matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors (MMPIs) has been developed (Skiles et al, 2001, Current Medicinal Chemistry, 8, 425-474; Peterson, 2004, Heart Failure Reviews, 9, 63-79; Henrotin et al, 2002, Expert Opin. Ther. Patents, 12(l):29-43). However, many MMPIs exhibit a muscoskeletal syndrome (tendonitis, fibroplasias, mylasia, arthralasia) as a dose-limiting side effect. It has been proposed that inhibition of MMP-1 or MMP-14 may be responsible for these effects.<br>
Therefore, there is an increasing need to develop matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors with a well-defined specificity profile.<br>
Specific inhibitors, especially towards MMP-1, have been reported, including MMP-13 inhibitors (Stotnicki et al, 2003, Current Opinion in Drug Discovery and Development, 6(5):742-759), MMP-12 inhibitors (WO 01/83461), MMP-2 and MMP-9 inhibitors (Wada et al, 2002, J. Biol. Chem. 45: 219-232).<br>
The high relevance of the metalloproteinase pathway in some widely spread diseases stresses the need to develop inhibitors, including selective inhibitors of MMPs, especially of gelatinases such as MMP-2 and/or MMP-9 and/or MMP-12.<br>

Synthetic approaches:<br>
A preferred process for preparing a compound of Formula (I) consists in coupling a dioxolane-protected di-carboxylic acid of formula (II) with the appropriate amine (III) to form the intermediate (IV) wherein A, R!, R2, R4, R5, R6, R7 and n are defined as above (Scheme 1 below). General protocols for such coupling are given below in the Examples, using conditions and methods well known to those skilled in the art to prepare an amide bond from an amine and a carboxylic acid or carboxylic acid derivative (e.g. acid chloride), with or without standard coupling agents, such as e.g. DIG, EDC, TBTU, DCC, HATU, PyBOP®, Isobutyl chloroformate, l-methyl-2-chloropyridinium iodide (Mukaiyama's reagent) or others in the presence or not of bases such as TEA, DIEA, NMM in a suitable solvent such as DCM, THF or DMF.<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
Compounds of Formula (III) are commercially available or can be obtained from protocols herein described.<br>
An attractive method for the preparation of compounds of Formula (III) wherein A is N and R1 is an optionally substituted aryl or heteroaryl may be the reaction of piperazine of Formula (IX) with an aryl halide or sulfonate of Formula (X) where X is a leaving group such as Cl, Br, I, Ms, or Tf, in the presence of a palladium catalyst such as Pd(OAc)2 or Pd2(dba)3, PdCl2(dppf), a phosphine such as (+/-)-BINAP, PPh3, P(p-Tol)3, l,l'-diphenyl phosphino ferrocene (dppf) and a base such as t-BuOK or t-BuONa. In some cases, when the aryl halide or sulfonate of Formula (X) is sufficiently reactive (e.g. 2-chloro-pyridine), the reaction can proceed without the palladium catalyst and without phosphines.<br>
Intermediate of formula (IV) can be reacted with a hydroxylamine or with a protected hydroxylamine HaNO-R8 where R8 is a protecting group such as t-butyl, benzyl, trialkylsilyl or any suitable protecting group, followed by a known deprotection step to form compound of Formula (I) (Scheme 2 below).<br>

Intermediates of formula (II) may be prepared by methods known or by protocols herein described.<br>
An alternative route for the preparation of compounds of Formula (I) may be the coupling of a carboxylic acids of formula (V) with hydroxylamine or with a protected hydroxylamine H^NO-R8 where R8 is a protecting group such as t-butyl, benzyl, trialkylsilyl, tetrahydropyranyl (THP) or any suitable protecting group, with or without standard coupling agents, such as e.g. DIG, EDC, TBTU, DCC, HATU, PyBOP®, Isobutyl chloroformate, l-methyl-2-chloropyridinium iodide (Mukaiyama's reagent), followed by a known deprotection step to form compound of Formula (I) (Scheme 3 below).<br>

According to a further general process, compounds of Formula (I) can be converted to alternative compounds of Formula (1), employing suitable interconversion techniques well known by a person skilled in the art.<br>
If the above set of general synthetic methods are not applicable to obtain compounds according to Formula (I) and/or necessary intermediates for the synthesis of compounds of Formula (1), suitable methods of preparation known by a person skilled in the art should be used. In general, the synthesis pathways for any individual compound of Formula (I) will depend on the specific substitutents of each molecule and upon the ready availability of<br>
intermediates necessary; again such factors being appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art. For all the protection and deprotection methods, see Philip J. Kocienski, in "Protecting Groups", Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart, New York, 1994 and, Theodora W. Greene and Peter G, M. Wuts in "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", Wiley Interscience, 3rd Edition 1999. Those skilled in the art will recognize that certain reactions are best carried out when potentially reactive functionality on the molecule is masked or protected, thus avoiding side reactions and/or increasing the yield of the reaction. Examples of protecting group moieties may be found in Philip J. Kocienski, 1994 above and in Greene et al, 1999, above. The need and choice of protecting groups for a particular reaction is known to those skilled in the art and depends on the nature of the functional group to be protected (hydroxy, amino, carboxy, etc.), the structure and the stability of the molecule of which the substituent is part of the reaction conditions.<br>
Compounds of this invention can be isolated in association with solvent molecules by crystallization from evaporation of an appropriate solvent. The pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds of Formula (I), which contain a basic center, may be prepared in a conventional manner. For example, a solution of the free base may be treated with a suitable acid, either neat or in a suitable solution, and the resulting salt isolated either by filtration or by evaporation under vacuum of the reaction solvent. Pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts may be obtained in an analogous manner by treating a solution of compound of Formula (I) with a suitable base. Both types of salts may be formed or interconverted using ion-exchange resin techniques.<br>

The novel derivatives according to Formula (VI) can be prepared from readily available starting materials by several synthetic approaches, using both solution-phase and solid-phase chemistry protocols. Examples of synthetic pathways for the will be described.<br>
A preferred process for preparing a compound of Formula (VI) consists in coupling a dioxolane-protected di-carboxylic acid of formula (VII) with the appropriate amine (VIII) to form the intermediate (IX) wherein E, R1 and R15 and n are defined as above (Scheme 4 below). General protocols for such coupling are given below in the Examples, using conditions and methods well known to those skilled in the art to prepare an amide bond from an amine and a carboxylic acid or carboxylic acid derivative (e.g. acid chloride), with or without standard coupling agents, such as e.g. DIG, EDC, TBTU, DCC, HATU, PyBOP®, Isobutyl chloroformate, 1 -methyl-2-chloropyridinium iodide (Mukaiyama's reagent) or others in the presence or not of bases such as TEA, DIEA, NMM in a suitable solvent such as DCM, THF or DMF.<br><br>
Intermediate of formula (IX) can be reacted with hydroxylamine or can be reacted with a protected hydroxylamine HzNO-R8 where R8 is a protecting group such as t-butyl, benzyl, trialkylsilyl, tetrahydropyranyl (THP) or a any suitable protecting group, followed by a known deprotection step to form compound of Formula (VI) (Scheme 5 below).<br>

Biological assays:<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be subjected to the following assays:<br>
Example 115: Enzyme Inhibition Assays<br>
Compounds of the invention were tested to assess their activities as inhibitors of MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-9, MMP-14 and MMP-12.<br>
MMP-9 Assay Protocol<br>
Compounds of the invention were tested for inhibitory activity against 92kDa gelatinase (MMP-9) in an assay using a coumarin-labeled peptide substrate, (7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)acetyl-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-(3-[2 ,4-dinitrophenyl]-L-2,3diaminopropionyl)-Ala-Arg-NH2 (McaPLGLDpaAR) (Knight et al, FEBS Lett. 1992; 263-266).<br>
Stock solutions were made up as follows: Assay Butter:  100 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6<br>
containing 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM CaCl2, and 0.05% Brij 35.<br>
Substrate: 0.4 mM McaPLGLDpaAR (from Bachem) (0.437mg/ml) stock solution in 100%<br>
DMSO (stored at -20°C). Dilute to 8 U.M in assay butter.<br>
Enzyme:   Recombinant  human  92  kDa  gelatinase  (MMP-9;  APMA  (4-aminophenyl<br>
mercuric acetate) -activated if necessary) appropriately diluted in assay butter.<br>
Test Compounds were prepared initially as 10 mM compound solution in 100% DMSO, diluted to 1 mM in 100% DMSO, then serially diluted 3-fold in 100% DMSO across columns 1-10 of a 96-well microtitre plate Assay concentration range, 100u.M (column 1) to 5.1 nM (column 10).<br>
The assay was performed in a total volume of 100 uL per well in 96-well microtitre plates. Activated enzyme (20 uL) was added to the wells followed by 20 U.L of assay butter. Appropriate concentrations of test compounds dissolved in 10 u,L of DMSO were then added followed by 50 uL of McaPLGLDpaAR (8 uM, prepared by dilution of DMSO stock in assay butter). For each as say ten concentrations of test compound were examined in duplicate. Control wells lack either enzyme or test compound. The reactions were incubated<br>
at 37°C for 2 hours. The fluorescence at 405 nm was measured immediately with an SLT Fluostar fluorometer (SL T Labinstruments GmbH, Grodig, Austria) using 320 nm excitation, without stopping the reaction.<br>
The effect of the test compound was determined from the dose response curve generated by the 10 duplicate concentrations of inhibitor. The IC50 (the concentration of compound required to give a 50% decrease in enzyme activity) was obtained by fitting data to the equation, Y = a + ((b - a) /(I + (c/X)d)). (Y = inhibition achieved for a particular dose; X = the dose in nM; a= minimum y or zero % inhibition; b = maximum y or 100% inhibition; c = is the IC5o; d = is the slope). The result was rounded to one significant figure.<br>

Group 4: Experimental group receives CC14 (i.p.), and once daily, 10 mg/kg s.c. of the<br>
compound according to the invention..<br>
Group 5: Experimental group receives CC14 (i.p.) and once daily, 20 mg/kg s.c. of the<br>
compound according to the invention.<br>
Rats were labeled on their tails.  The labels are checked and renewed, if necessary, after<br>
every CCU injection.<br>
Procedure<br>
CCU (Prolabo) in olive oil is administered every 3 days for three weeks by intra-peritoneal<br>
injection (0,25 ml CCU/kg body weight, diluted in oil 1:1 vol:vol for a total volume of 0.5<br>
ml/kg). Animals are weighed daily. If body weight decreased by more than 10% of the<br>
initial weight, the animal is excluded from the study.<br>
Vehicles and compound are used as follows:<br>
•	CCU was administered in olive oil (Prolabo) at a 1:1 dilution;<br>
•	The compound of the invention is suspended in 0.25 % Tween-80 and 0.25%<br>
carboxymethylcellulose  in  sterile  0.9% NaCl.  The  solution  is  kept  at  4°C<br>
throughout the experiment and used each day to prepare the suspensions.<br>
The compound of the invention is administered daily by subcutaneous (s.c.) injection at a volume of administration of 5 ml/kg. Groups 1 and 2 are dosed s.c. with 5 ml/kg of vehicle. Freshly prepared solutions are used on each day of the experiment. Administrations are carried out each day at the same time.<br>
The treatment of groups of this study is started for each animal at the time of the first CCU administration and is continued for 21 consecutive days. The last administration of test substances or vehicle is done 1 day before the sacrifice of the animals.<br>
Results<br>
Death are reported, date and supposed cause are reported.<br>
Serum enzyme levels<br>
Animals are killed 21 days following the first CCU administration by isofurane inhalation. Blood is withdrawn individually at the time of sacrifice, i.e. one day after the last<br>
administration of test substance or vehicle. Blood is centrifuged at 4°C. Plasma is carefully collected and aliquoted in 3 fractions. Plasma aspartate amino transferase (ASAT) and alanine amino transferase (ALAT) levels are measured in order to assess liver necrosis. Increased ASAT and ALAT levels in serum are associated with liver impairment. Average ASAT and ALAT levels for control animals and those treated with the compound of the invention at three different dosages are reported.<br>
Histological evaluation of liver fibrosis<br>
Liver fibrosis is evaluated by measuring the area of fibrosis in the liver using microchotomy. Results are reported as percentage area that is fibrotic.<br>
The liver is removed, the three lobes are dissected and samples are removed and either fixed in 10% formaldehyde or frozen at -80 °C.<br>
Liver sections are embedded in paraffin blocks. Sectioning and staining with Sirius red are performed. Quantification of the fibrosis in liver is carried out on a minimum of 3 sections taken from different locations in the liver. The quantitative analysis is performed using an image analyser (Imstar) and the software Morphostar.<br>
Average area percentages of fibrosis in the livers of animals in the different groups are calculated.<br>
Example 118: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) model<br>
Compounds of the invention can be evaluated for their ability to prevent cigarette smoke-induced COPD.<br>
Female AJ mice (Harlan, 17-25 g) are exposed daily to cigarette smoke (CS) for 11 consecutive days in groups of 5, in individual clear chambers. Animals are weighed prior to treatment, on day 6 of exposure and on day 12. The CS was generated using 1R1 cigarettes purchased from the Institute of Tobacco Research, University of Kentucky, USA and is allowed to enter the chambers at a flow rate of 100 ml/min.<br>
In order to minimise any potential problems caused by repeated exposure to a high level of daily CS, the exposure of the mice to TS is increased gradually over the time to a maximum of 6 cigarettes from day 5 to day 11 (approximately 48 min exposure). A sham group of mice is also exposed to air on a daily basis for equivalent lengths of time as controls (no CS exposure).<br>
Treatment<br>
Compounds of the invention are prepared in 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose Na salt (CMC,<br>
Sigma reference C-4888) as vehicle.<br>
Animals are orally dosed twice daily by gavage in a dose volume of 5ml/kg, 1 h prior to air<br>
or CS exposure and 6 h after the cessation of the exposure.<br>
Sham animals (n=10) received vehicle and are exposed to air for up to a maximum of 50<br>
minutes per day. The control group (n=10) received vehicle and is exposed to CS (up to a<br>
maximum of 6 cigarettes per day). Additional groups are exposed to CS (from up to a<br>
maximum of 6 cigarettes per day) and treated with one of the test compounds or the<br>
reference compound.<br>
Bronchoalveolar lavage and Cytospin analysis<br>
Twenty-four hours after the last CS exposure, bronchoalveolar lavage is performed as follows:<br>
The trachea is dissected under deep anesthesia (sodium pentobarbitone) and cannulated using a Portex nylon intravenous cannula shortened to approximately 8 mm. Phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Gibco) containing 10 units/ml heparin (0.4 ml) is gently instilled and withdrawn 3 times. The lavage fluid is placed in an Eppendorf tube and kept on ice prior to subsequent determinations. Then, lavage fluid is separated from cells by centrifugation. The supernatant is removed and frozen for subsequent analysis. The cell pellet is resuspended in PBS and total cell numbers are calculated by counting a stained aliquot (Turks stain) under a microscope using a haemocytometer.<br>
Differential cell count is then performed as follows: The residual cell pellet is diluted to approximately 105 cells per ml. A volume of 500 ul is placed in the funnel of a cytospin<br>
slide and is centrifuged for 8 min at 800 rpm. The slide is air-dried and stained using 'Kwik-Diff solutions (Shandon) following purchaser instructions. Slides are dried and cover-slipped and differential cell count is done using light microscopy. Up to 400 cells are counted for each slide. Cells were differentiated using standard morphometric techniques.<br>
Statistical Analysis<br>
The mean +/- S.D. is calculated for each experimental group.<br>
Results are analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by a<br>
Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Statistical significance is considered with p<br>
Example 119: Experimental Allergic Encephalomyelitis (EAE) model<br>
Compounds according to the invention can be evaluated for their activity in a model for multiple sclerosis in mice.<br>
Animals<br>
C57BL/6NCrlBR female mice are used. Mice are kept in wire cages (cm 32xl4xl3h) with stainless steel feeders and fed on a standard diet (4RF21, Charles River, Italy) and water ad libitum. From day 7, wet pellets are also placed every day on the bottom of the cage. Plastic bottles are used in addition to the automatic water system.<br>
Experimental procedure<br>
Mice are immunized (day = 0) by injecting s.c. in the left flank 0.2 ml of an emulsion composed of 200 ^g MOGss-ss peptide (Neosystem, Strasbourg, France) in Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA, Difco, Detroit, U.S.A.) containing 0.5 mg of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Immediately after, they receive an i.p. injection of 500 ng pertussis toxin (List Biological Lab., Campbell, CA, U.S.A.) dissolved in 400 uL of buffer (0.5 M NaCl, 0.017% Triton X-100, 0.015 M Tris, pH = 7.5). On day 2, the animals are given a second injection of 500 ng pertussis toxin.<br>
On day 7, the mice receive a second dose of 200 u,g of MOG35.55 peptide in CFA injected<br>
s.c. in the right flank. Starting approximately from day 8-10, this procedure results in a<br>
progressing paralysis, arising from the tail and ascending up to the forelimbs.<br>
Animals are individually weighed and are examined for the presence of paralysis that is<br>
scored according to the following score-system (1):<br>
0=      no signs of disease<br>
0.5 =   partial tail paralysis<br>
1	=      tail paralysis<br>
1.5 =   tail paralysis + partial unilateral hindlimb paralysis<br>
2	=      tail paralysis + bilateral hindlimb weakness or partial paralysis<br>
2.5 =   tail paralysis + partial hindlimb paralysis (lowered pelvi)<br>
3	=      tail paralysis +complete hindlimb paralysis<br>
3.5 =   tail paralysis + hindlimb paralysis + incontinence<br>
4	=      tail paralysis + hindlimb paralysis + weakness or partial paralysis of forelimbs<br>
5	=      moribund or dead<br>
Mortality and clinical signs are monitored daily in each group of treatment, by a technician who is unaware of treatments.<br>
Daily treatment with compounds, their vehicle or with a reference compound starts on day 7 and continued for 15 or 21 consecutive days in all groups.<br>
Histopathological examination<br>
At the end of the treatment period, each animal is anesthetised with sodium pentobarbital<br>
and is transcardially perfused-fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde via the left ventricle. Fixed<br>
spinal cords are then carefully dissected out.<br>
Spinal  cord  slices are embedded  in  paraffin  blocks.  Sectioning and  staining with<br>
hematoxylin and eosin and CD45 staining for inflammation, and with Kluver-PAS (Luxol<br>
fast blue plus Periodic Acid Schiff staining) and Bielchowski's staining for the detection of<br>
demyelination and axonal loss, are performed.<br>
In the spinal cord, the total area of all slices is measured for each animal as points of<br>
intersection of a 10x10 grid at a magnification of 0.4x0.4 mm per grid. The perivascular<br>
inflammatory infiltrates are counted in each slice in order to obtain a total value for each animal and evaluated as number of infiltrates per mm2. Demyelination and axonal loss areas are measured for each animal as points of intersection of 10x10 grid at a magnification of 0.1x0.1 mm per grid and are expressed as a percentage of total demyelination area over the total area of the slices.<br>
Data evaluation and Statistical analysis<br>
The results of clinical and histopathological observations are expressed as the mean (±SEM) scores in each treatment group. Values obtained in the test drug-treated groups are compared with that of the positive control group. Significance of differences among groups relating to clinical score are analysed by one-way ANOVA, followed in case of significance (p
Differences among groups for the presence of perivascular inflammatory infiltrates and the extent of demyelination and axonal loss in the spinal cord as well as body weight data are analysed by one-way ANOVA, followed in case of significance (p
