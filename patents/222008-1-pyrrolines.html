When used as insecticides, the active compounds according to the invention, can<br>
furthermore be present in their commercially available formulations and in the use<br>
forms, prepared from these formulations, as a mixture with synergistic agents. Syner-<br>
gistic agents are compounds which increase the action of the active compounds<br>
5	according to the invention, without it being necessary for the synergistic agent added<br>
to be active itself.<br>
The active compound content of the use forms prepared from the commercially<br>
available formulations can vary within wide limits. The active compound concen-<br>
10	tration of the use forms can be from 0.0000001 to 95% by weight of active com-<br>
pound, preferably between 0.0001 and 1% by weight.<br>
The compounds are employed in a customary manner appropriate for the use forms.<br>
15	When used against hygiene pests and pests of stored products, the active compound<br>
is distinguished by an excellent residual action on wood and clay as well as a good stability to alkali on limed substrates.<br>
As already mentioned above, it is possible to treat all plants and their parts according<br>
20	to the invention. In a preferred embodiment, wild plant species and plant cultivars, or<br>
those obtained by conventional biological breeding, such as crossing or protoplast<br>
fusion, and parts thereof, are treated. In a further preferred embodiment, transgenic<br>
plants and plant cultivars obtained by genetic engineering, if appropriate in<br>
combination with conventional methods (Genetically Modified Organisms), and<br>
25	parts thereof are treated. The term "parts" or "parts of plants" or "plant parts" has<br>
been explained above.<br>

/ Depending on the plant species or plant cultivars, their location, and growth<br>
conditions (soils, climate, vegetation period, diet), the treatment according to^the<br>
invention may also result in superadditive ("synergistic") effects Thus, for example;<br>
reduced application rates and/or a widening of the activity spectrum and/or an-<br><br>

quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage<br>
10	stability and/or processability of the harvested products are possible which exceed<br>
the effects which were actually to be expected.<br>
The preferred transgenic plants or plant cultivars (i.e. those obtained by genetic engineering) which are to be treated according to the invention include all plants<br>
15	which, in the genetic modification, received genetic material  which imparted<br>
particular advantageous useful properties ("traits") to these plants. Examples of such properties are better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better<br>
20	quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage<br>
stability and/or processability of the harvested products. Further and particularly emphasized examples of such properties are a better defence of the plants against animal and microbial pests, such as against insects, mites, phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and/or viruses, and also increased tolerance of the plants to certain<br>
25	herbicidally active compounds.  Examples of transgenic plants which may be<br>
mentioned are the important crop plants, such as cereals (wheat, rice), maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton, oilseed rape and also fruit plants (with the fruits apples, pears, citrus fruits and grapevines), and particular emphasis is given to maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton and oilseed rape. Traits that are emphasized are in particular<br>
30	increased defence of the plants against insects by toxins formed in the plants, in<br>
particular those formed by the genetic material from Bacillus thuringiensis (for<br><br>

referred to as "Bt plants"). Traits that are furthermore particularly emphasized are the   '<br>
increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds, for <br>
5	example imidazolinones, sulphonylureas, glyphosate or phosphinotricin (for example<br>
the "PAT" gene). The genes which impart the desired traits in question can also be present in combination with one another in the transgenic plants. Examples of "Bt plants" which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties, soya bean varieties and potato varieties which are sold under the trade names YIELD GARD®<br>

StarLink® (for example maize), Bollgard® (cotton), Nucotn® (cotton) and NewLeaf® (potato). Examples of herbicide-tolerant plants which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties and soya bean varieties which are sold under the trade names Roundup Ready® (tolerance to glyphosate, for example maize, cotton,<br>
15	soya bean), Liberty Link® (tolerance to phosphinotricin, for example oilseed rape),<br>
IMI® (tolerance to imidazolinones) and STS® (tolerance to sulphonylureas, for example maize). Herbicide-resistant plants (plants bred in a conventional manner for herbicide tolerance) which may be mentioned include the varieties sold under the name Clearfield® (for example maize). Of course, these statements also apply to<br>
20	plant cultivars having these or still to be developed genetic traits, which plants will<br>
be developed and/or marketed in the future.<br>
The plants listed can be treated according to the invention in a particularly<br>
advantageous manner with the compounds of the general formula (I) or the active<br>
25	compound mixtures according to the invention. The preferred ranges stated above for<br>
the active compounds or mixtures also apply to the treatment of these plants. Particular emphasis is given to the treatment of plants with the compounds or the mixtures specifically mentioned in the present text.<br>

All or some of the binder mentioned can be replaced by a fixing agent (mixture) or a plasticizer (mixture). These additives are intended to prevent evaporation of the active compounds and crystallization or precipitation. They preferably replace- 0.01 to 30% of the binder (based on 100% of the binder employed). , ,<br>
The plasticizers originate from the chemical classes of phthalic acid esters, such as<br>
dibutyl, dioctyl or benzyl butyl phthalate, phosphoric acid esters, such as, tribuyl<br>
phosphate, adipic acid esters, such as di-(2-ethylhexyl) adipate, stearates, such as<br>
butyl stearate or amyl stearate, oleates, such as butyl oleate, glycerol ethers or higher<br>
