				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
COMMUNICATION TERMINAL APPARATUS AND BASE STATION<br>
APPARATUS<br>
This invention relates to a communication terminal apparatus<br>
and a method for determining the type of communication.<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a communication<br>
terminal apparatus and a base station apparatus used in<br>
a digital mobile conmunication system.<br>
Background Art<br>
Communications using digital cellular phones in<br>
Japan are currently carried out according to a PDC<br>
(Personal Digital Cellular) system, which is a unified<br>
standard in Japan. The PDC system uses a TDMA (Time<br>
Division Multiple Access ) system in which a radio channel<br>
of a same frequency iS assigned to every mobile station<br>
user for an allotted time. According to the TDMA system,<br>
a frequency shared by a plurality of mobile station users<br>
is divided into units called "frames" having time<br>
periodicity and a frame is further divided into several<br>
slots. A channel through which each mobile station user<br>
performs communications is determined by assigning each<br>
slot to each mobile station user.<br>
However, when each frame is divided into slots,<br>
there are certain linits to shortening the slot length,<br>
hence limits to increasing the number of channels in the<br>
TDMA system. Moreover, to increase the number of<br><br>
channels in the TDMA system, increasing the length of<br>
each frame and thereby increasing the number of slots<br>
included in the frame will result in increased intervals<br>
between slots assigred to a same mobile station user,<br>
making it difficult to perform high-speed data<br>
communications. Therefore, under the PDC system under<br>
which there are limits to frequency bands used, it is<br>
well imaginable that the time will come that the system<br>
will no longer be able to cope with an increased number<br>
of channels in view of the recent increase in the number<br>
of digital cellular phone subscribers.<br>
For this reason, in order to solve the above problem,<br>
a CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) system is recently<br>
becoming a focus of attention as a communication system<br>
for the next-generat ion digital mobile communication<br>
system and CDMA-based technological development is<br>
underway in an increasing manner. The CDMA system is a<br>
system implementing multiple access by applying coding<br>
processing to signals of each channel so that each<br>
channel can be distinguished.<br>
A digital mobile communication system using a<br>
conventional CDMA system will be explained. FIG.1<br>
illustrates a configuration of a CDMA-based digital<br>
mobile communication system. This digital mobile<br>
communication system is configured by base station 1 and<br>
mobile station 2, which can communicate with this base<br>
station. In this digital mobile communication system,<br>
communications between the base station and mobile<br><br>
station are carried cut with a voice channel, high-speed<br>
data channel and control channel all multiplexed on a<br>
same radio channel.<br>
Here, in this CDMA-based digital mobile<br>
communication system, the chip rate of a spreading code<br>
used to apply coding processing to signals of each<br>
channel is constant. Because of this, in the CDMA-based<br>
digital mobile communication system, the spreading<br>
factor is changed according to the required data transfer<br>
rate, which varies between a voice communication and<br>
high-speed data comnunication. That is, the higher the<br>
data transfer rate, the lower the spreading factor<br>
becomes. When the spreading factor decreases as the data<br>
transfer rate increases, the bit error rate also<br>
increases, deteriorating the communication quality.<br>
Therefore, to prevent the communication quality<br>
from deteriorating due to a reduction of the spreading<br>
factor, the conventional CDMA-based digital mobile<br>
communication system controls high bit rate<br>
communications with a high data transfer rate so that<br>
signal power is increased. This makes it possible to<br>
keep signal energy per bit constant and stabilize the<br>
communication quality.<br>
However, the conventional CDMA-based digital<br>
mobile communication system has the following problems:<br>
That is, such control causes a high-speed data<br>
communication with a higher data transfer rate to have<br>
greater signal power than a voice communication with a<br><br>
lower data transfer rate. When a high-speed data<br>
communication has greater signal power than a voice<br>
communication, in the case where a voice channel and<br>
high-speed data channel are multiplexed on a same radio<br>
channel as shown in FIG.1, the high-speed data<br>
communication with greater power becomes an interference<br>
component against the voice communication with smaller<br>
power, resulting in deterioration of the quality of voice<br>
communication.<br>
Moreover, multiplexing a voice channel that<br>
requires a real-time characteristic and a high-speed<br>
data channel that requires no real-time characteristic<br>
on the same radio channel is not appropriate from the<br>
standpoint of the nature of each signal.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide<br>
a communication terminal apparatus and a base station<br>
apparatus capable of preventing the quality of a voice<br>
communication with a low data transfer rate from<br>
deteriorating so that a high-speed data communication<br>
signal with greater power because of a high data transfer<br>
rate does not affect a voice communication signal with<br>
smaller power because of a low data transfer rate.<br>
The present inventor has come up with the present<br>
invention after focusing on the fact that the reason for<br>
deterioration of the quality of a voice communication<br>
with a low data transfer rate is that a communication<br><br>
is carried out by multiplexing a voice channel and<br>
high-speed data channel on a same radio channel and<br>
discovering that separating the radio channel used by<br>
the voice channel from the radio channel used by the<br>
high-speed data channel can prevent the quality of the<br>
voice communication from deteriorating.<br>
Thus, in order to attain the above object, the<br>
present invention separates the radio channel for the<br>
voice communication from the radio channel for the<br>
high-speed data communication and carries out an<br>
appropriate communication according to the type of<br>
communication channel by channel, thus preventing the<br>
voice communication from being affected by the high-<br>
speed data communication.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention<br>
With reference now to the attached drawings,<br>
embodiments of the present invention will be explained<br>
in detail below.<br>
(Embodiment 1)<br>
Embodiment 1 of the present invention will be<br>
explained using FIG. 2 to FIG.5.<br>
FIG.2 is a configuration diagram of a radio<br>
communication system according to Embodiment 1 of the<br>
present invention. This radio communication system is<br>
configured by mobile station apparatus 101, base station<br>
apparatus 102 that can communicate with this mobile<br>
station apparatus 101, voice base station apparatus 103<br>
included in base station apparatus 102 and high-speed<br><br>
data base station apparatus 104 included in base station<br>
apparatus 102.<br>
Mobile station apparatus 101 is a mobile station<br>
apparatus capable of carrying out both voice<br>
communication and high-speed data communication. Voice<br>
base station apparatus 103 is included in base station<br>
apparatus 102 and is a base station apparatus that<br>
carries out voice communications with mobile station<br>
apparatus 101 using a radio channel for voice<br>
communication. High-speed data base station apparatus<br>
104 is included in base station apparatus 102 and is a<br>
base station apparatus that carries out high-speed data<br>
communications with mobile station apparatus 101 using<br>
a radio channel for high-speed data communication.<br>
The radio channel for voice communication is<br>
configured by a voice channel and a control channel based<br>
on a TDMA-based data transfer rate and communication<br>
system.<br>
The radio channel for high-speed data<br>
communication is configured by a high-speed data channel<br>
and a control channel, based on a CDMA-based data transfer<br>
rate and communication system.<br>
When a voice signal is received, mobile station<br>
apparatus 101 receives not only a voice signal but also<br>
a control signal notifying that the communication is a<br>
voice communication using a control channel of the radio<br>
channel for voice communication. On the other hand, when<br>
a high-speed data signal is received, mobile station<br><br>
apparatus 101 receives not only a high-speed data signal<br>
but also a control signal notifying that the<br>
communication is a high-speed data communication, using<br>
a control channel of the radio channel for high-speed<br>
data communication.<br>
Next, the configuration of mobile station<br>
apparatus 101 will be explained. FIG. 3 is a block<br>
diagram showing the configuration of mobile station<br>
apparatus 101.<br>
Voice modulation/demodulation section 201 is used<br>
when mobile station apparatus 101 carries out a voice<br>
communication, and carries out predetermined radio<br>
processing and TDMA-based modulation/demodulation<br>
processing on a voice signal transmitted/received<br>
through antenna 211. Furthermore, voice<br>
modulation/demodulation section 201 carries out<br>
demodulation processing on a control signal received<br>
using the control channel of the radio channel for voice<br>
communication.<br>
When mobile station apparatus 101 carries out voice<br>
transmission, voice processing section 202 applies voice<br>
coding processing on an analog voice signal output from<br>
microphone 203 and converts the analog voice signal to<br>
a digital voice signal.<br>
When mobile station apparatus 101 carries out voice<br>
reception, voice processing section 202 applies voice<br>
decoding processing on a digital voice signal and<br>
converts the digital signal to an analog voice signal.<br><br>
The converted analog voice signal is output as voice from<br>
speaker 204.<br>
High-speed data modulation/demodulation section<br>
205 is used when mobile station apparatus 101 carries<br>
out high-speed data communication, and performs<br>
predetermined radio processing and CDMA-based<br>
modulation/demodulation processing on a high-speed data<br>
signal transmitted/received through antenna 211.<br>
Furthermore, high-speed data modulation/demodulation<br>
section 205 carries out demodulation processing on the<br>
received control signal using a control channel of the<br>
radio channel for high-speed data communication.<br>
Data interface section 206 performs mutual<br>
conversion between a data format in high-speed data<br>
modulation/demodulation section 205 and a data format<br>
in an external apparatus so that mobile station apparatus<br>
101 can perform data input/output via data input/output<br>
terminal 207 to/from an external apparatus, which is not<br>
shown in the figure.<br>
Operation sectian 208 is configured by a push button<br>
or the like. Operation section 208 is used when mobile<br>
station apparatus carries out transmission, and outputs<br>
a call request signal to radio channel control section<br>
209 based on the user's operations.<br>
When the call request signal is output from<br>
operation section 208, radio channel control section 209<br>
detects whether any external apparatus, which is not<br>
shown in the figure, is connected to input/output<br><br>
terminal 207 or not. Radio channel control section 209<br>
also decides whether the type of a communication is a<br>
voice communication or high-speed data communication<br>
from a control signal demodulated by voice<br>
modulation/demodulation section 201 and high-speed data<br>
modulation/demodulation section 205. Radio channel<br>
control section 209 controls changeover switch 210 based<br>
on the detection result or the decision result.<br>
Changeover switch 210 connects antenna 211 with<br>
both voice modulation/demodulation section 201 and<br>
high-speed data modulation/demodulation section 205<br>
until a control sigral is output from radio channel<br>
control section 209. Furthermore, changeover switch<br>
210 connects antenna. 211 with either voice<br>
modulation/demodulation section 201 or high-speed data<br>
modulation/demodulation section 205 based on a control<br>
signal from radio channel control section 209.<br>
As shown above, equipped with radio channel control<br>
section 209, mobile station apparatus 101 performs a<br>
voice communication using a radio channel for voice<br>
communication according to a TDMA system and performs<br>
a high-speed data communication using a radio channel<br>
for high-speed data communication according to a CDMA<br>
system, that is, mobule station apparatus 101 can select<br>
a radio channel according to the type of communication.<br>
Then, the configuration of radio channel control<br>
section 209 will be explained. FIG.4 is a block diagram<br>
showing the configuration of radio channel control<br><br>
section 209. Radio channel control section 209 is<br>
configured by detection section 301, decision section<br>
302 and changeover control section 303.<br>
Detection section 301 is used when mobile station<br>
apparatus 101 carries out transmission, and detects<br>
whether any external apparatus, which is not shown in<br>
the figure, is connected to input/output terminal 207<br>
or not and outputs a detection signal indicating the<br>
detection result to changeover control section 303.<br>
That is, in the case where an external apparatus,<br>
which is not shown in the figure, is connected to<br>
input/output terminal 207, detection section 301 outputs<br>
a detection signal requesting a high-speed data<br>
communication to changeover control section 303. In the<br>
case where no external apparatus, which is not shown in<br>
the figure, is connected to input/output terminal 207,<br>
detection section 30 1 outputs a detection signal<br>
requesting a voice communication to changeover control<br>
section 303.<br>
Decision section 302 is used when mobile station<br>
apparatus 101 performs reception, and decides whether<br>
the type of communication is a voice communication or<br>
high-speed data communication from a control signal<br>
demodulated by voice modulation/demodulation section<br>
201 and high-speed data communication and outputs a<br>
control signal indicating the decision result to<br>
changeover control section 303.<br>
Changeover control section 303 outputs a control<br><br>
signal to operate changeover switch 210 to changeover<br>
switch 210 based on the content of the detection signal<br>
or the control signal. That is, changeover control<br>
section 303 operates changeover switch 210 based on the<br>
content of the detection signal or the control signal.<br>
More specifically, in the case where it is judged<br>
that a voice communication will be carried out,<br>
changeover control section 303 connects a line linking<br>
voice modulation/demodulation section 201 to antenna 211<br>
and disconnects a line linking high-speed data<br>
modulation/demodulation section 205 to antenna 211. On<br>
the other hand, in tie case where it is judged that a<br>
high-speed data commanication will be carried out,<br>
changeover control section 303 connects a line linking<br>
high-speed data modulation/demodulation section 205 to<br>
antenna 211 and disconnects a line linking voice<br>
modulation/demodulation section 201 to antenna 211.<br>
Then, the operation of mobile station apparatus 101<br>
having the above configuration will be explained using<br>
the flow chart in FI3.5.<br>
In steps (hereinafter referred to as "ST") 401 to<br>
ST404, power to mobile station apparatus 101 is turned<br>
ON and it is checked whether there is any outgoing call<br>
from mobile station apparatus 101. In the case where<br>
there is an outgoing call, the process moves on to ST405,<br>
which will be described later and in the case where there<br>
is no outgoing call, it is checked whether there is any<br>
incoming call to mobile station apparatus 101. In the<br><br>
case where there is an incoming call, the process moves<br>
on to ST405, which will be described later and in the<br>
case where there is no incoming call, it is checked<br>
whether power to mobile station apparatus 101 is turned<br>
OFF or not. In the case where power to mobile station<br>
apparatus 101 is turned OFF, the processing ends here<br>
and in the case where power is not turned OFF, the system<br>
moves back to ST402 and it is checked whether there is<br>
any outgoing call again.<br>
In the case where the process moves from ST402 or<br>
ST403 to ST405, it is decided in ST405 whether the type<br>
of communication is a voice communication or a highspeed<br>
data communication.<br>
In the case where mobile station apparatus 101<br>
carries out transmission, detection section 301 detects<br>
whether any external apparatus, which is not shown in<br>
the figure, is connected to input/output terminal<br>
section 207 triggered by the user of mobile station 101<br>
operating operation section 208. Then, detection<br>
section 301 outputs a detection signal indicating the<br>
detection result to changeover control section 303.<br>
In the case where mobile station apparatus 101<br>
carries out reception, decision section 302 decides<br>
whether the type of communication is voice communication<br>
or high-speed data communication based on a control<br>
signal demodulated by voice modulation/demodulation<br>
section 201 or high-speed data modulation/demodulation<br>
section 205. Then, decision section 302 outputs a<br><br>
control signal indicating the decision result to<br>
changeover control section 303.<br>
Changeover control section 303 decides whether the<br>
type of communication is a voice communication or<br>
high-speed data communication based on the content of<br>
the detection signal or the control signal, in the case<br>
where the decision result shows that it is a voice<br>
communication, the process moves on to ST406 and in the<br>
case where the decision result shows that it is a<br>
high-speed data communication, the process moves on to<br>
ST409.<br>
In the case where the process moves on to ST406,<br>
changeover control section 303 operates changeover<br>
switch 210 to connect a line linking voice<br>
modulation/demodulation section 201 to antenna 211 and<br>
disconnects a line linking high-speed data<br>
modulation/demodulation section 205 to antenna 211.<br>
This makes voice modulation/demodulation section 201<br>
perform TDMA-based modulation/demodulation processing<br>
on a transmitted/received voice signal. Thus, a<br>
TDMA-based call is established during a voice<br>
communication.<br>
In ST407, a TDMA-based voice communication is<br>
carried out. That is, regarding the voice signal, a<br>
communication is carried out between mobile station<br>
apparatus 101 and voice base station apparatus 103 based<br>
on a TDMA-based data transfer rate and communication<br>
system using a radio channel for voice communication<br><br>
In ST408, it is checked whether the voice<br>
communication has been completed or not, and in the case<br>
where the voice communication has been completed, the<br>
process moves back to ST402 and in the case where the<br>
voice communication is in progress, the process moves<br>
back to ST407.<br>
On the other hand, in the case where the process<br>
moves from ST405 tc ST409, changeover control section<br>
303 operates changeover switch 210 to connect a line<br>
linking high-speed data modulation/demodulation section<br>
205 to antenna 211 and disconnects a line linking voice<br>
modulation/demodulation section 201 to antenna 211.<br>
This makes high-speed data modulation/demodulation<br>
section 205 perform CDMA-based modulation/demodulation<br>
processing on a transmitted/received high-speed data<br>
signal. Thus, a CDMA-based call is established during<br>
a high-speed data communication.<br>
In ST410, a CDMA-based high-speed data<br>
communication is carried out. That is, regarding the<br>
high-speed data, a communication is carried out between<br>
mobile station apparatus 101 and high-speed data base<br>
station apparatus 104 based on a CDMA-based data transfer<br>
rate and communication system using a radio channel for<br>
high-speed data communication.<br>
In ST411, it is decked whether the high-speed data<br>
communication has been completed or not, and in the case<br>
where the high-speed data communication has been<br>
completed, the process moves back to ST402 and in the<br><br>
case where the high-speed data communication is in<br>
progress, the process moves back to ST410.<br>
As shown above, this embodiment makes it possible<br>
to carry out a communication by selecting a radio channel<br>
to be used according to the use in such a way that a voice<br>
communication is carried out using a TDMA-based radio<br>
channel for voice communication during a voice<br>
communication and a high-speed data communication is<br>
carried out using a CDMA-based radio channel for<br>
high-speed data communication during a high-speed data<br>
communication. As a result, it is possible to prevent<br>
the voice communication from being affected by the<br>
high-speed data communication, thus preventing<br>
deterioration of the quality of the voice communication.<br>
It is also possible to perform a radio communication<br>
based on an appropriate communication system according<br>
to the type of communication.<br>
Furthermore, this embodiment is implemented by<br>
simply adding a base station apparatus based on a CDMA<br>
system, which is a next-generation digital cellular<br>
phone communication system, to a base station apparatus<br>
installed based on a TDMA system, which is a current<br>
digital cellular phone communication system in Japan.<br>
That is, no changes need to be added to the existing base<br>
station apparatus installed based on the TDMA system.<br>
In this way, it is possible to easily implement a mobile<br>
communication system capable of preventing<br>
deterioration of the quality of voice communication.<br><br>
Furthermore, since there is no need to discard the<br>
existing base station apparatus installed based on the<br>
TDMA system, it is possible to contribute to effective<br>
utilization of resources.<br>
(Embodiment 2)<br>
Embodiment 2 of the present invention will be<br>
explained suing FIG. 6 to FIG. 10.<br>
FIG. 6 is a configuration diagram of a radio<br>
communication systen according to Embodiment 2 of the<br>
present invention. This radio communication system is<br>
configured by mobile station apparatus 501 and base<br>
station apparatus 502 that can communicate with this<br>
mobile station apparatus 501.<br>
Mobile station apparatus 501 is a mobile station<br>
apparatus capable of carrying out both voice<br>
communication and high-speed data communication. Base<br>
station apparatus 502 is a base station apparatus capable<br>
of carrying out both voice communication and high-speed<br>
data communication.<br>
A radio channel for a common control channel is a<br>
radio channel for a common control signal used for mobile<br>
station apparatus 501 and base station apparatus 502 to<br>
decide the type of communication. Moreover, the radio<br>
channel for the common control channel is configured by<br>
a common control channel, which is digital-modulated<br>
based on a TDMA system with a lower data transfer rate<br>
and narrower band than a TDMA system used for a voice<br><br>
signal.<br>
The radio chanrel for voice communication is a radio<br>
channel used when mobile station apparatus 501 and base<br>
station apparatus 502 carry out a voice communication.<br>
Furthermore, the radio channel for voice communication<br>
is configured by a voice channel, which is digital-<br>
modulated based on a TDMA-based data transfer rate and<br>
communication system.<br>
The radio channel for high-speed data<br>
communication is a radio channel used when mobile station<br>
apparatus 501 and base station apparatus 502 carry out<br>
a high-speed data communication. Furthermore, the<br>
radio channel for high-speed data communication is<br>
configured by a high-speed data channel, which is<br>
digital-modulated based on a CDMA-based data transfer<br>
rate and communication system.<br>
When a voice signal is received, mobile station<br>
apparatus 501 receives a common control signal notifying<br>
that the communication is a voice communication using<br>
the radio channel for common control channel. On the<br>
other hand, when a high-speed data signal is received,<br>
mobile station apparatus 501 receives a common control<br>
signal notifying that the communication is a high-speed<br>
data communication using the radio channel for common<br>
control channel.<br>
Next, the configuration of mobile station<br>
apparatus 501 will be explained. FIG.7 is a block<br>
diagram showing the configuration of mobile station<br><br>
apparatus 501. However, components in FIG.7 with the<br>
same configuration and operation as those of the<br>
components shown in FIG.3 will be assigned the same<br>
reference numerals and their explanations will be<br>
omitted.<br>
Voice modulation/demodulation section 601 is used<br>
when mobile station apparatus 501 carries out a voice<br>
communication, and carries out predetermined radio<br>
processing and TDMA-based modulation/demodulation<br>
processing on a voice signal transmitted/received<br>
through antenna 211.<br>
High-speed data modulation/demodulation section<br>
602 is used when mobile station apparatus 501 carries<br>
out a high-speed data communication, and performs<br>
predetermined radio processing and CDMA-based<br>
modulation/demodulation processing on a high-speed data<br>
signal transmitted/received through antenna 211.<br>
Common control channel modulation/demodulation<br>
section 603 carries out predetermined radio processing<br>
and modulation/demodulation processing based on a TDMA<br>
system with a lower data transfer rate and narrower band<br>
than the TDMA system used for a voice signal on a common<br>
control signal transmitted/received through antenna<br>
211.<br>
When a call request signal is output from operation<br>
section 208, radio channel control section 604 detects<br>
whether any external apparatus, which is not shown in<br>
the figure, is connected to input/output terminal 207<br><br>
or not. Radio channel control section 604 also decides<br>
whether the type of communication is a voice<br>
communication or high-speed data communication from a<br>
common control signal demodulated by common control<br>
channel modulation/demodulation section 603. Radio<br>
channel control section 604 controls changeover switch<br>
605 based on the detection result or the decision result.<br>
Changeover switch 605 connects antenna 211 with<br>
common control channel modulation/demodulation section<br>
603 until a control signal is output from radio channel<br>
control section 604. Furthermore, changeover switch<br>
605 connects antenna 211 with either voice<br>
modulation/demodulation section 601 or high-speed data<br>
modulation/demodulation section 602 based on a control<br>
signal from radio channel control section 604.<br>
As shown above, equipped with radio channel control<br>
section 604, mobile station apparatus 501 performs a<br>
voice communication using a radio channel for voice<br>
communication according to a TDMA system and performs<br>
a high-speed data communication using a radio channel<br>
for high-speed data communication according to a CDMA<br>
system, that is, mobile station apparatus 501 can select<br>
a radio channel according to the type of communication.<br>
Then, the configuration of radio channel control<br>
section 604 will be explained. FIG.8 is a block diagram<br>
showing the configuration of radio channel control<br>
section 604. However, components of the detection<br>
section shown in FIG. 8 that have the same configuration<br><br>
and operation as those in FIG.4 will be assigned the same<br>
reference numerals and their explanations will be<br>
omitted.<br>
Radio channel control section 604 is configured by<br>
detection section 301, decision section 701 and<br>
changeover control section 702.<br>
Decision section 701 is used when mobile station<br>
apparatus 501 carries out reception, and decides whether<br>
the type of communication is a voice communication or<br>
high-speed data communication based on a common control<br>
signal demodulated by common control channel<br>
modulation/demodulation section 603. Then, decision<br>
section 701 outputs a control signal indicating the<br>
decision result to changeover control section 702.<br>
Changeover control section 702 outputs a control<br>
signal to operate changeover switch 605 based on the<br>
content of a detection signal from detection section 301<br>
or a control signal from decision section 701 to<br>
changeover switch 605. That is, changeover control<br>
section 702 operates changeover switch 605 based on the<br>
content of the detection signal or the control signal.<br>
More specifically, in the case where it is judged<br>
that a voice communication will be carried out,<br>
changeover control section 702 connects a line linking<br>
voice modulation/demodulation section 601 to antenna 211<br>
and disconnects a line linking high-speed data<br>
modulation/demodulation section 602 to antenna 211. On<br>
the other hand, in the case where it is judged that a<br><br>
high-speed data communication will be carried out,<br>
changeover control section 702 connects a line linking<br>
high-speed data modulation/demodulation section 602 to<br>
antenna 211 and disconnects a line linking voice<br>
modulation/demodulation section 601 to antenna 211.<br>
Then, the operation of mobile station apparatus 501<br>
having the configuration above will be explained using<br>
the flow chart in FIG.9. However, processing in ST801<br>
to ST804 in FIG.9 is the same as that in ST401 to ST404<br>
in FIG.5, and therefore the explanation thereof will be<br>
omitted.<br>
In ST805, it is decided whether the type of<br>
communication is a voice communication or a high-speed<br>
data communication. In the case where mobile station<br>
apparatus 501 carries out transmission, detection<br>
section 301 detects whether any external apparatus,<br>
which is not shown in the figure, is connected to<br>
input/output terminal section 207 triggered by the user<br>
of mobile station 501 operating operation section 208.<br>
Then, detection section 301 outputs a detection signal<br>
indicating the detection result to changeover control<br>
section 702.<br>
In the case where mobile station apparatus 501<br>
carries out reception, decision section 701 decides<br>
whether the type of communication is a voice<br>
communication or high-speed data communication based on<br>
a common control signal demodulated by common control<br>
channel modulation/demodulation section 603. Then,<br><br>
decision section 701 outputs a control signal indicating<br>
the decision result to changeover control section 702.<br>
Changeover control section 702 decides whether the<br>
type of communication is a voice communication or<br>
high-speed data communication based on the content of<br>
the detection signal or the control signal. In the case<br>
where the decision result shows that it is a voice<br>
communication, the process moves on to ST806 and in the<br>
case where the decision result shows that it is a<br>
high-speed data communication, the process moves on to<br>
ST809.<br>
In the case where the process moves on to ST806,<br>
changeover control section 702 changes changeover switch<br>
605 from the common control channel<br>
modulation/demodulation section 603 side to the voice<br>
modulation/demodulation section 601 side and connects<br>
a line linking voice modulation/demodulation section 601<br>
to antenna 211. This makes voice<br>
modulation/demodulation section 601 perform TDMA-based<br>
modulation/demodulation processing on a<br>
transmitted/received voice signal. Thus, a TDMA-based<br>
call is established during a voice communication.<br>
In ST807, a TDMA-based voice communication is<br>
carried out. That is, regarding the voice signal, a<br>
communication is carried out between mobile station<br>
apparatus 501 and base station apparatus 502 based on<br>
a TDMA-based data transfer rate and communication system<br>
using a radio channel for voice communication.<br><br>
In ST808, it in checked whether the voice<br>
communication has been completed or not, and in the case<br>
where the voice communication has been completed, the<br>
process moves back to ST802 and in the case where the<br>
voice communication is in progress, the process moves<br>
back to ST807.<br>
On the other hand, in the case where the process<br>
moves from ST805 to ST809, changeover control section<br>
702 changes the changeover switch from the common control<br>
channel modulation/demodulation section 603 side to the<br>
high-speed data modulation/demodulation section 602<br>
side and connects a Line linking high-speed data<br>
modulation/demodulation section 602 to antenna 211.<br>
This makes high-speed data modulation/demodulation<br>
section 602 perform CDMA-based modulation/demodulation<br>
processing on a transmitted/received high-speed data<br>
signal. Thus, a CDMA-based call is established during<br>
a high-speed data communication.<br>
In ST810, a CDMA-based high-speed data<br>
communication is carried out. That is, regarding the<br>
high-speed data, a communication is carried out between<br>
mobile station apparatus 501 and base station apparatus<br>
502 based on a CDMA-based data transfer rate and<br>
communication system using a radio channel for high-<br>
speed data communication.<br>
In ST811, it is checked whether the high-speed data<br>
communication has been completed or not, and in the case<br>
where the high-speed data communication has been<br><br>
completed, the process moves back to ST802 and in the<br>
case where the high-speed data communication is in<br>
progress, the process moves back to ST810.<br>
Then, the configuration of base station apparatus<br>
502 will be explained. FIG. 10 is a block diagram showing<br>
the configuration of base station apparatus 502.<br>
Voice modulation/demodulation section 901 is used<br>
when base station apparatus 502 carries out a voice<br>
communication, and carries out predetermined radio<br>
processing and TDMA-based modulation/demodulation<br>
processing on a voice signal transmitted/received<br>
through antenna 902.<br>
When base station apparatus 502 carries out voice<br>
transmission, voice processing section 903 applies voice<br>
coding processing on an analog voice signal output from<br>
a higher-level apparatus, which is not shown in the<br>
figure, via input/output terminal 904 and converts the<br>
analog voice signal to a digital voice signal.<br>
Furthermore, when base station apparatus 502<br>
carries out voice reception, voice processing section<br>
903 applies voice decoding processing on a digital voice<br>
signal and converts the digital voice signal to an analog<br>
voice signal. Voice processing section 903 outputs the<br>
converted analog voice signal to a higher-level<br>
apparatus, which is not shown in the figure, via<br>
input/output terminal 904.<br>
High-speed data modulation/demodulation section<br>
905 is used when base station apparatus 502 carries out<br><br>
high-speed data communication, and performs<br>
predetermined radio processing and CDMA-based<br>
modulation/demodulation processing on a high-speed data<br>
signal transmitted/received through antenna 906.<br>
Common control channel modulation/demodulation<br>
section 908 carries out predetermined radio processing<br>
and modulation/demodulation processing based on a TDMA<br>
system with a lower data transfer rate and narrower band<br>
than the TDMA systen. used for a voice signal on a common<br>
control signal transmitted/received through antenna<br>
909.<br>
Decision section 910 is used when base station<br>
apparatus 502 carries out reception, and decides whether<br>
the type of communication is voice communication or<br>
high-speed data communication based on a common control<br>
signal demodulated by common control channel<br>
modulation/demodulation section 908 and outputs a<br>
control signal indicating the decision result to<br>
changeover control section 911.<br>
Control section 911 outputs an operation<br>
instruction signal/operation stop instruction signal to<br>
voice modulation/domodulation section 901 and high-<br>
speed data modulation/demodulation section 905 based on<br>
the content of a control signal from decision section<br>
910.<br>
Then, the operation of base station apparatus 502<br>
will be explained using FIG.10. First, the case where<br>
base station apparatus 532 carries out reception will<br><br>
be explained.<br>
When a voice signal is received, base station<br>
apparatus 502 receives a common control signal notifying<br>
that the communication is a voice communication using<br>
the radio channel for common control channel. On the<br>
other hand, when a high-speed data signal is received,<br>
base station apparatus 502 receives a common control<br>
signal notifying that the communication is a high-speed<br>
data communication using the radio channel for common<br>
control channel.<br>
In base station apparatus 502, common control<br>
channel modulation/demodulation section 908 performs<br>
demodulation processing on the common control signal<br>
received through antenna 909. Then, decision section<br>
910	decides whether the type of communication is voice<br>
communication or high-speed data communication based on<br>
the demodulated comnon control signal. Then, decision<br>
section 910 outputs a control signal indicating the<br>
decision result to control section 911.<br>
Control section 911 outputs an operation<br>
instruction signal/operation stop instruction signal to<br>
voice modulation/demodulation section 901 and high-<br>
speed data modulation/demodulation section 905 based on<br>
the content of a ccntrol signal from decision section<br>
910.<br>
That is, in the case where the type of the<br>
communication is voice communication, control section<br>
911	outputs an operation instruction signal to voice<br><br>
modulation/demodulation section 901 and an operation<br>
stop instruction signal to high-speed data<br>
modulation/demodulation section 905. On the other hand,<br>
in the case where the type of the communication is<br>
high-speed data communication, control section 911<br>
outputs an operation instruction signal to high-speed<br>
data modulation/demodulation section 905 and an<br>
operation stop instruction signal to voice<br>
modulation/demodulation section 901.<br>
Through the above operations, in the case of a voice<br>
communication, the voice signal received through antenna<br>
902 is subjected tc demodulation processing by voice<br>
modulation/demodulction section 901 and converted to an<br>
analog voice signa] by voice processing section 903.<br>
Then, the converted analog voice signal is output to a<br>
higher-level apparatus, which is not shown in the figure,<br>
via input/output terminal 904.<br>
On the other hand, in the case of a high-speed data<br>
communication, the high-speed data signal received<br>
through antenna 906 is subjected to demodulation<br>
processing by high-speed data modulation/demodulation<br>
section 905. Then, the demodulated high-speed data<br>
signal is output to a higher-level apparatus, which is<br>
not shown in the figure, via input/output terminal 907.<br>
Then, the case where base station apparatus 502<br>
carries out transmission will be explained. First,<br>
control section 911 outputs a common control signal to<br>
distinguish whether a signal to be transmitted is a voice<br><br>
signal or high-speed data signal to common control<br>
channel modulation/demodulation section 908. The<br>
common control signal is modulated by common control<br>
channel modulation/demodulation section 908, then<br>
transmitted through antenna 909.<br>
Furthermore, control section 911 outputs a common<br>
control signal to common control channel<br>
modulation/demodulation section 908 and at the same time<br>
outputs an operation instruction signal/operation stop<br>
instruction signal to voice modulation/demodulation<br>
section 901 and high-speed data modulation/demodulation<br>
section 905.<br>
That is, in the case where the type of the<br>
communication is voice communication, control section<br>
911 outputs an operation instruction signal to voice<br>
modulation/demodulation section 901 and an operation<br>
stop instruction signal to high-speed data<br>
modulation/demodulation section 905. On the other hand,<br>
in the case where the type of the communication is<br>
high-speed data communication, control section 911<br>
outputs an operation instruction signal to high-speed<br>
data modulation/demodulation section 905 and an<br>
operation stop instruction signal to voice<br>
modulation/demodulation section 901.<br>
Through the above operations, in the case of a voice<br>
communication, the voice signal output from a<br>
higher-level apparatus, which is not shown in the figure,<br>
via input/output terminal 904 is converted to a digital<br><br>
voice signal by voice processing section 903. Then, the<br>
converted digital voice signal is subjected to<br>
modulation processing by voice modulation/demodulation<br>
section 901 and transmitted through antenna 902.<br>
On the other hand, in the case of a high-speed data<br>
communication, the high-speed data signal output from<br>
a higher-level apparatus, which is not shown in the<br>
figure, via input/output terminal 907 is subjected to<br>
modulation processing by high-speed data<br>
modulation/demodulation section 905. The modulated<br>
high-speed data signal is transmitted through antenna<br>
906.<br>
As shown above, this embodiment makes it possible<br>
to carry out a communication by selecting a radio channel<br>
to be used according to the use in such a way that a voice<br>
communication is carried out using a TDMA-based radio<br>
channel for voice communication during a voice<br>
communication and a high-speed data communication is<br>
carried out using a CDMA-based radio channel for<br>
high-speed data communication during a high-speed data<br>
communication. As a result, it is possible to prevent<br>
the voice communication from being affected by the<br>
high-speed data communication, thus preventing<br>
deterioration of the quality of the voice communication.<br>
It is also possible to perform a radio communication<br>
based on an appropriate communication system according<br>
to the type of communication.<br>
Furthermore, according to this embodiment, the<br><br>
control channel used by a control signal that controls<br>
connections to a radio channel for voice communication<br>
and a radio channel for high-speed data communication<br>
is separated as an independent common control channel<br>
to be used commonly for both radio channels, making it<br>
possible to improve the efficiency of frequency<br>
utilization in a radio communication system.<br>
On the other hand, it is also possible to use a<br>
common control signal digital-modulated based on a TDMA<br>
system used for a voice signal. This allows the common<br>
control channel and voice channel to use a same frequency<br>
band, making it possible to further improve the<br>
efficiency of frequency utilization in a radio<br>
communication system. Furthermore, since it is<br>
possible to perform modulation/demodulation processing<br>
for a common control signal based on a TDMA system used<br>
for a voice signal, the common control channel<br>
modulation/demodulation section and the voice<br>
modulation/demodulation section can be unified into one<br>
modulation/demodulation section, which simplifies the<br>
apparatus configuration of the mobile station apparatus<br>
and base station apparatus.<br>
Moreover, it is also possible to use a common<br>
control signal digital-modulated based on a CDMA system.<br>
This allows the common control channel and high-speed<br>
data channel to use a same frequency band, making it<br>
possible to further improve the efficiency of frequency<br>
utilization in a radio communication system.<br><br>
Furthermore, since it is possible to perform<br>
modulation/demodulation processing for a common control<br>
signal based on a CDMA system, the common control channel<br>
modulation/demodulation section and the high-speed data<br>
modulation/demodulation section can be unified into one<br>
modulation/demodulation section, which simplifies the<br>
apparatus configuration of the mobile station apparatus<br>
and base station apparatus.<br>
(Embodiment 3)<br>
Embodiment 3 of the present invention will be<br>
explained suing FIG.11 to FIG.17.<br>
FIG.11 is a configuration diagram of a radio<br>
communication system according to Embodiment 3 of the<br>
present invention. This radio communication system is<br>
configured by mobile station apparatus 1001 and base<br>
station apparatus 1002 that can communicate with this<br>
mobile station apparatus 1001.<br>
Mobile station apparatus 1001 is a mobile station<br>
apparatus capable of carrying out both voice<br>
communication and high-speed data communication. Base<br>
station apparatus 1002 is a base station apparatus<br>
capable of carrying out both voice communication and<br>
high-speed data communication.<br>
A radio charnel for common control channel is a<br>
radio channel for a common control signal used for mobile<br>
station apparatus 1001 and base station apparatus 1002<br>
to decide the type of communication.<br><br>
The radio channel for voice communication is a radio<br>
channel used when mobile station apparatus 1001 and base<br>
station apparatus 1002 carry out a voice communication.<br>
Furthermore, this radio channel for voice communication<br>
is configured by a voice channel digital-modulated based<br>
on a CDMA system.<br>
The radio channel for high-speed data<br>
communication is a radio channel used when mobile station<br>
apparatus 1001 and base station apparatus 1002 carry out<br>
a high-speed data communication. Furthermore, this<br>
radio channel for high-speed data communication is<br>
configured by a high-speed data channel digital-<br>
modulated based on an HDR (High Data Rate) system.<br>
Here, the HDR system is used for high-speed data<br>
communication and is a communication system that<br>
improves the transfer efficiency of downlink from a base<br>
station apparatus to a mobile station apparatus. In the<br>
HDR system, a communication channel (here, a high-speed<br>
data channel) is time-divided and assigned to each mobile<br>
station apparatus and the transfer rate of the assigned<br>
slot is set according to the communication quality.<br>
When a voice signal is received, mobile station<br>
apparatus 1001 receives a common control signal<br>
notifying that the communication is a voice<br>
communication using a radio channel for a common control<br>
channel. On the other hand, when a high-speed data<br>
signal is received, mobile station apparatus 1001<br>
receives a common control signal notifying that the<br><br>
communication is a high-speed data communication using<br>
a radio channel for a common control channel.<br>
Next, the configuration of mobile station<br>
apparatus 1001 will be explained. FIG.12 is a block<br>
diagram showing the configuration of mobile station<br>
apparatus 1001. However, components with the same<br>
configuration and operation as those of the components<br>
shown in FIG.7 will be assigned the same reference<br>
numerals and their explanations will be omitted.<br>
CDMA section 1101 is used when mobile station<br>
apparatus 1001 carries out a voice communication. CDMA<br>
section 1101 carries; out CDMA-based predetermined radio<br>
processing and predetermined modulation/demodulation<br>
processing on a voice signal transmitted/received<br>
through antenna 21].<br>
HDR section 1L02 is used when mobile station<br>
apparatus 1001 carries out a high-speed data<br>
communication. HDR section 1102 performs HDR-based<br>
predetermined radio processing and predetermined<br>
modulation/demodulation processing on a high-speed data<br>
signal transmitted/received through antenna 211. The<br>
detailed configuration of HDR section 1102 will be<br>
described later.<br>
Common control channel modulation/demodulation<br>
section 1103 carries out predetermined radio processing<br>
and modulation/demodulation processing on a common<br>
control signal transmitted/received through antenna<br>
211.<br><br>
As shown above, mobile station apparatus 1001<br>
performs a voice communication using a radio channel for<br>
voice communication according to a CDMA system and<br>
performs a high-speed data communication using a radio<br>
channel for high-speed data communication according to<br>
an HDR system, that is, mobile station apparatus 1001<br>
can select a radio channel according to the type of<br>
communication.<br>
Then, the configuration of HDR section 1102 will<br>
be explained. FIG.13 is a block diagram showing the<br>
configuration of HDR section 1102.<br>
In HDR section 1102, reception RF section 1201<br>
carries out predetermined radio processing on a received<br>
signal and outputs the received signal to despreading<br>
section 1202. Despreading section 1202 despreads the<br>
received signal. Then, despreading section 1202<br>
outputs a known signal, which is inserted at<br>
predetermined intervals into the received signal, to<br>
communication quality measuring section 1203 and outputs<br>
the part other than the known signal of the received<br>
signal to selection section 1211.<br>
Communication quality measuring section 1203<br>
measures a value indicating the communication quality<br>
(e.g., signal-to-interference ratio, etc.) based on the<br>
known signal and outputs the value to transfer rate<br>
calculation section 1204. Transfer rate calculation<br>
section 1204 calculates a transfer rate value with which<br>
it is possible to communicate with base station apparatus<br><br>
1002 based on the value indicating the communication<br>
quality and outputs the value to request signal<br>
generation section 1205. Request signal generation<br>
section 1205 generates a signal (data rate request<br>
signal; hereinafter referred to as "DRR") to notify base<br>
station apparatus 1002 of the transfer rate value and<br>
outputs the signal to modulation section 1206.<br>
Modulation section 1206 performs predetermined<br>
modulation processing on the DRR output from request<br>
signal generation section 1205 and transmitted data<br>
output from interface section 206 and outputs the<br>
modulated signal to spreading section 1207. Spreading<br>
section 1207 spreads the signal output from modulation<br>
section 1206 and outputs the spread signal to<br>
transmission RF section 1208. Transmission RF section<br>
1208 performs predetermined radio processing on the<br>
spread signal.<br>
Demodulation section 1209 performs predetermined<br>
demodulation processing on a control signal inserted at<br>
the beginning of each frame of the received signal and<br>
a slot selected by selection section 1211. Reception<br>
control section 1210 notifies selection section 1211 of<br>
a slot including a signal addressed to the own station<br>
based on the control signal inserted at the beginning<br>
of each frame of the received signal. Selection section<br>
1211 selects the corresponding slot from the received<br>
signal according to -;he notification from reception<br>
control section 1210 and outputs the slot to demodulation<br><br>
section 1209.<br>
More specifically, demodulation section 1209,<br>
reception control section 1210 and selection section<br>
1211 operate as follows. FIG.14 illustrates a frame<br>
configuration of high-speed data received by mobile<br>
station apparatus 1)01. As shown in FIG. 14, a control<br>
signal indicating the timing at which each slot is<br>
transferred and the length of each slot is inserted at<br>
the beginning of a frame.<br>
First, demodulation section 1209 demodulates a<br>
control signal inserted at the beginning of the frame<br>
and outputs the control signal to reception control<br>
section 1210. Reception control section 1210 notifies<br>
selection section 1211 of the timing at which a slot<br>
including a signal addressed to the own station is<br>
transferred and the length of the slot according to the<br>
content of the control signal. Now, suppose, for example,<br>
the user of mobile station apparatus 1001 is user 2. The<br>
signal addressed to the own station is included in slot<br>
2. Thus, reception control section 1210 notifies<br>
selection section 1211 of the timing at which slot 2 is<br>
transferred and the length of slot 2.<br>
Selection section 1211 selects slot 2 from among<br>
slots input after the control signal according to the<br>
notification from reception control section 1210 and<br>
outputs slot 2 to demodulation section 1209. Then,<br>
demodulation section 1209 demodulates the signal<br>
addressed to the own station included in slot 2. This<br><br>
allows mobile station apparatus 1001 to obtain high-<br>
speed data addressed to the own station.<br>
Then, the operation of mobile station apparatus<br>
1001 with the configuration above will be explained using<br>
the flow chart in FIG.15. However, in FIG.15, the<br>
processing in ST1401 to ST1405 is the same as that in<br>
ST801 to ST805 in FIG.9 and its explanation will be<br>
omitted.<br>
In ST1406, changeover control section 702 in radio<br>
channel control section 604 changes changeover switch<br>
605 from the common control channel<br>
modulation/demodulation section 1103 side to the CDMA<br>
section 1101 side and connects a line linking CDMA<br>
section 1101 to antenna 211. This makes CDMA section<br>
1101 perform modulation/demodulation processing, etc.<br>
on a transmitted/received voice signal according to a<br>
CDMA system. Thus, a CDMA-based call is established<br>
during a voice communication.<br>
In ST1407, a CDMA-based voice communication is<br>
carried out. That is, regarding the voice signal, a<br>
communication is carried out between mobile station<br>
apparatus 1001 and base station apparatus 1002 based on<br>
a CDMA system using a radio channel for voice<br>
communication.<br>
In ST1408, it is checked whether the voice<br>
communication has been completed or not, and in the case<br>
where the voice communication has been completed, the<br>
process moves back to ST1402 and in the case where the<br><br>
voice communication is in progress, the process moves<br>
back to ST1407.<br>
On the other hand, in ST1409, changeover control<br>
section 702 in radio channel control section 604 changes<br>
changeover switch 605 from the common control channel<br>
modulation/demodulation section 1103 side to the HDR<br>
section 1102 to connect a line linking HDR section 1102<br>
to antenna 211. This makes HDR section 1102 perform<br>
HDR-based modulation/demodulation processing on a<br>
transmitted/received high-speed data signal. Thus, an<br>
HDR-based call is established during a high-speed data<br>
communication.<br>
In ST1410, an HDR-based high-speed data<br>
communication is carried out. That is, regarding the<br>
high-speed data, a communication is carried out between<br>
mobile station apparatus 1001 and base station apparatus<br>
1002 based on an HDR system using a radio channel for<br>
high-speed data communication.<br>
In ST1411, it is checked whether the high-speed data<br>
communication has been completed or not, and in the case<br>
where the high-speed data communication has been<br>
completed, the process moves back to ST1402 and in the<br>
case where the high-speed data communication is in<br>
progress, the process moves back to ST1410.<br>
Then, the operation of base station apparatus 1002<br>
will be explained. FIG. 16 is a block diagram showing the<br>
configuration of base station apparatus 1002. However,<br>
the components shown in FIG.16 that have the same<br><br>
configuration and operation as those of the components<br>
in FIG.10 are assigned the same reference numerals and<br>
their explanation will be omitted.<br>
CDMA section 1501 is used when base station<br>
apparatus 1002 carries out a voice communication. CDMA<br>
section 1501 perforins CDMA-based predetermined radio<br>
processing and predetermined modulation/demodulation<br>
processing on a voice signal transmitted/received<br>
through antenna 902.<br>
HDR section 1502 is used when base station apparatus<br>
1002 carries out a high-speed data communication. HDR<br>
section 1502 performs HDR-based predetermined radio<br>
processing and predetermined modulation/demodulation<br>
processing, etc. on a high-speed data signal<br>
transmitted/received through antenna 906.<br>
Common control channel modulation/demodulation<br>
section 1503 carrier out predetermined radio processing<br>
and predetermined modulation/demodulation processing on<br>
a common control signal transmitted/received through<br>
antenna 909.<br>
Then, the configuration of HDR section 1502 will<br>
be explained. FIG. 17 is a block diagram showing the<br>
configuration of HDR section 1502.<br>
In HDR secticn 1502, reception RF section 1601<br>
carries out predetermined radio processing on a received<br>
signal and outputs the received signal to despreading<br>
section 1602. Despreading section 1602 despreads the<br>
received signal and outputs the despread signal to<br><br>
demodulation section 1603. Demodulation section 1603<br>
performs predetermined demodulation processing on the<br>
received signal. Then, demodulation section 1603<br>
outputs the DRR notified from each mobile station<br>
apparatus to assignment section 1604 and outputs signals<br>
other than the DRR to input/output terminal 907.<br>
Assignment section 1604 decides assignment of<br>
communication resources to each mobile station apparatus<br>
based on the DRR notified from each mobile station<br>
apparatus.<br>
Then, assignment section 1604 instructs buffer<br>
1605 to output transmitted data according to the<br>
determined assignment of the communication resources.<br>
Moreover, assignment section 1604 notifies frame<br>
creation section 1606 of the determined assignment of<br>
the communication resources. Assignment section 1604<br>
also instructs spreading section 1608 about a spreading<br>
code to spread the transmitted data.<br>
Buffer 1605 temporarily stores the transmitted<br>
data output via input/output terminal 907 and outputs<br>
the transmitted data to frame creation section 1606<br>
according to the instruction from assignment section<br>
1604.<br>
Frame creation section 1606 converts the<br>
transmitted data addressed to mobile station apparatuses<br>
to their respective slots according to the assignment<br>
of the communication resources notified from assignment<br>
section 1604, and then creates a frame combining those<br><br>
slots. Furthermore, frame creation section 1606 adds a<br>
control signal indicating the timing at which each slot<br>
is transferred and the length of each slot at the<br>
beginning of each frame. In this way, a frame with a<br>
configuration shown in FIG.14 is created. Frame<br>
creation section 1606 inserts a known signal into the<br>
transmitted data at predetermined intervals. Then,<br>
frame creation section 1606 outputs the created frame<br>
to modulation section 1607.<br>
Modulation section 1607 performs predetermined<br>
modulation processing on the transmitted data and<br>
outputs the modulated signal to spreading section 1608.<br>
Spreading section 1608 spreads the signal output from<br>
modulation section 16 07 using a spreading code<br>
instructed by assignment section 1604. Transmission RF<br>
section 1609 performs predetermined radio processing on<br>
the spread signal.<br>
Then, the operation of base station apparatus 1002<br>
will be explained using FIG. 16. First, the case where<br>
base station apparatus 1002 carries out reception will<br>
be explained.<br>
When a voice signal is received, base station<br>
apparatus 1002 receives a common control signal<br>
notifying that the communication is a voice<br>
communication using the radio channel for the common<br>
control channel. Furthermore, when a high-speed data<br>
signal is received, base station apparatus 1002 receives<br>
a common control signal notifying that the communication<br><br>
is a high-speed data communication using a radio channel<br>
for a common control channel.<br>
In base station apparatus 1002, common control<br>
channel modulation/demodulation section 1503 performs<br>
demodulation processing on the common control signal<br>
received through antenna 909. Decision section 910<br>
decides whether the type of communication is a voice<br>
communication or high-speed data communication based on<br>
the demodulated common control signal. Then, decision<br>
section 910 outputs a control signal indicating the<br>
decision result to control section 911.<br>
Control section 911 outputs an operation<br>
instruction signal/operation stop instruction signal to<br>
CDMA section 1501 and HDR section 1502 based on the<br>
content of the control signal from decision section 910.<br>
That is, when the type of the communication is a<br>
voice communication, control section 911 outputs an<br>
operation instruction signal to CDMA section 1501 and<br>
an operation stop instruction signal to HDR section 1502.<br>
On the other hand, when the type of the communication<br>
is a high-speed data communication, control section 911<br>
outputs an operation instruction signal to HDR section<br>
1502 and an operation stop instruction signal to CDMA<br>
section 1501.<br>
Through the above operations , in the case of a voice<br>
communication, the voice signal received through antenna<br>
902 is subjected to demodulation processing by CDMA<br>
section 1501. On the other hand, in the case of a<br><br>
high-speed data communication, the high-speed data<br>
signal received through antenna 906 is subjected to<br>
demodulation processing by HDR section 1502.<br>
Then, the case where base station apparatus 1002<br>
carries out transmission will be explained. First,<br>
control section 911 outputs a common control signal to<br>
distinguish whether a signal to be transmitted is a voice<br>
signal or high-speed data signal to common control<br>
channel modulation/demodulation section 1503. The<br>
common control signal is modulated by common control<br>
channel modulation/demodulation section 1503, and then<br>
transmitted through antenna 909.<br>
Furthermore, control section 911 outputs a common<br>
control signal to common control channel<br>
modulation/demodulation section 1503 and at the same<br>
time outputs an operation instruction signal/operation<br>
stop instruction signal to CDMA section 1501 and HDR<br>
section 1502.<br>
That is, in the case where the type of the<br>
communication is a voice communication, control section<br>
911 outputs an operation instruction signal to CDMA<br>
section 1501 and an operation stop instruction signal<br>
to HDR section 1502. On the other hand, in the case where<br>
the type of the communication is a high-speed data<br>
communication, control section 911 outputs an operation<br>
instruction signal to HDR section 1502 and an operation<br>
stop instruction signal to CDMA section 1501.<br>
Through the above operations, in the case of a voice<br><br>
communication, the voice signal output from voice<br>
processing section 903 is subjected to modulation<br>
processing by CDMA section 1501. On the other hand, in<br>
the case of a high-speed data communication, the<br>
high-speed data sigral output via input/output terminal<br>
907 is subjected to nodulation processing by HDR section<br>
1502.<br>
As shown above, this embodiment makes it possible<br>
to carry out a communication by selecting a radio channel<br>
to be used according to the use in such a way that a voice<br>
communication is carried out using a CDMA-based radio<br>
channel for voice communication during a voice<br>
communication and a high-speed data communication is<br>
carried out using an HDR-based radio channel for<br>
high-speed data conmunication during a high-speed data<br>
communication. Therefore, according to this embodiment,<br>
it is possible to perform a radio communication based<br>
on an appropriate communication system according to the<br>
type of communication.<br>
Embodiments 1 to 3 adopt a configuration to decide<br>
whether a voice communication is performed or a<br>
high-speed data communication is performed based on<br>
whether an external apparatus is connected to the<br>
input/output terminal or not during data transmission<br>
by the mobile station apparatus. However, the decision<br>
method is not limited to this. For example, it is also<br>
possible to adopt such a configuration that the user of<br>
the mobile station apparatus switches between voice<br><br>
communication and hie h-speed data communication through<br>
switch operations.<br>
Furthermore, Embodiments 2 and 3 adopt a<br>
configuration of a base station apparatus with 3 antennas<br>
provided for each channel. However, the number of<br>
antennas is not limited to this. For example, the base<br>
station apparatus can also be configured to have one<br>
antenna and receive all channel signals through that one<br>
antenna. Furthermore, it is also possible to make three<br>
antennas to form an array antenna allowing the base<br>
station apparatus to form directivity and<br>
transmit/receive signals of each channel to/from each<br>
mobile station apparatus.<br>
Furthermore, Embodiments 1 to 3 describe a mobile<br>
station apparatus as an example of communication<br>
terminal apparatus. However, Embodiments 1 to 3 are not<br>
only applicable to a mobile station apparatus, but also<br>
applicable to a ncn-mobile communication terminal<br>
apparatus such as a personal computer.<br>
As described above, the present invention can<br>
prevent a high-speed data communication signal with<br>
large power because of a high data transfer rate from<br>
affecting a voice communication signal with small power<br>
because of a low data transfer rate, thus preventing<br>
deterioration of the quality of voice communication at<br>
a low data transfer rate.<br>
This application is based on the Japanese Patent<br><br>
Application No.HEI 11-096963 filed on April 2, 1999 and<br>
the Japanese Patent Application No. 2000-072819 filed on<br>
March 15, 2000, entire content of which is expressly<br>
