				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention generally relates to a system for efficient operation of a<br>
hydro power generating station. The invention, in particular relates to a system<br>
for extracting optimally the mechanical power from a turbine during a part load<br>
operation of the power station. More particularly,the invention relates to a<br>
system for automatic and optimum load sharing of a plurality of generating<br>
machines in hydro power plants.<br>
PACKGRPUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Hydropower generation depends on the available water head and discharge<br>
through the machines. The regulation of water discharge for the head acting on<br>
a machine decides its generating capacity. In general, there are number of<br>
generating machines in a powerhouse and the generation of individual machine<br>
depends on the discharge flowing through it. Hydro machines are tailor made<br>
and are designed keeping in view the efficiency weightage factor at various loads<br>
which are decided by power utility depending on grid loading. The normal load<br>
variation allowed in hydro machines is normally 40% to 100% depending on the<br>
type of a machine . Since the performance characteristics of a hydro turbine<br>
follows a curved line (ref. Fig.1) with a peak efficiency at certain part load, the<br>
variation in efficiency within the permissible range is generally in the order of 5<br>
to 7%.<br>
Normally the plant operator at a hydro power plant lack the help of a suitable<br>
device to monitor efficiency variation of the turbine at different operating<br>
conditions, hence the loading of individual machine in part load demand is<br>
accomplished arbitrarily. This generally leads to operation of the machines in<br>
non-optimum zones leading to loss of efficiency and more maintenance.<br>
An US Patent No. 4280060 discloses a teaching of a dedicated microcomputer-<br>
based control system for steam turbine-generators wherein a hierarchy of<br>
microcomputer subsystems interactive with a conventional analog<br>
electrohydraulic control system to provide control and monitoring capabilities<br>
during all operating phases of the turbine-generator. The separate<br>
microcomputer subsystems are programmed for coordinated interaction and<br>
communication through shared, dual-port read/-write memory units and each<br>
microcomputer subsystem is programmed and configured to handle a separate<br>
group of control responsibilities in a distributed control system. The<br>
microcomputer hierarchy includes an input and calculations computer having<br>
means for interfacing with analog input data sources and sensors which report<br>
on various operating parameters of the turbine-generator and from which<br>
thermal and mechanical stress and other derived quantities are calculated; a<br>
display and communications computer adapted to interface with a plant<br>
computer and with an operator control panel and other display and readout<br>
devices whereby operating personnel may interact with the control system; and<br>
a control computer, standing at the top of the hierarchy; for receiving<br>
information from the other computers, for making decisions based on that<br>
information and, through input/output ports, for providing the electro-hydraulic<br>
control system with directions for optimal control of the turbine-generator within<br>
its thermal and mechanical limitations. The dedicated supervisory controller<br>
provides a plurality of operating modes.<br>
The patent (US-4280060) on the Supervisory Contro) of Steam Turbine is<br>
centered on the design and operation of a typical Distributed Control Systems<br>
(DCS) which is not a basis for the instant applications.<br>
The instant application is mainly focused on the conservation of water resource<br>
and maximizing Power output from a Hydro Power Plants.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to propose a system for<br>
automatic and optimum load-sharing of a plurality of generating machines in<br>
hydro-power plants which eliminates the disadvantages of prior art.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose a system for automatic and<br>
optimum load-sharing of a plurality of generating machines in hydro-power<br>
plants which in particular provides data input to the operator during part-load<br>
regime in respect of the distributable optimum load among the plurality of<br>
generating machines.<br>
An yet another object of the present invention is to propose a system for<br>
automatic and optimum load-sharing of a plurality of generating machines in<br>
hydro-power plants which enables each of the plurality of generating machines<br>
to operate in best-possible efficiency zone thereby minimizing hydraulic<br>
perturbation and noise including wastage of energy.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to propose a system for automatic<br>
and optimum load-sharing of a plurality of generating machines in hydro-power<br>
plants which enhances the power generation in lean discharge phase including<br>
saving of natural resources for example, water.<br>
A still further object of the present invention is to propose a system for<br>
automatic and optimum load-sharing of a plurality of generating machines in<br>
hydro-power plants which reduces the maintenance cost and simultaneously<br>
increases the operating life of the machines.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a system for automatic and optimum load sharing<br>
of a plurality of generating machines in hydro power plants, the system<br>
comprising an ALSS(automatic load-sharing system) configurator module for<br>
providing inputs, the configurator module containing project specific data in<br>
respect of the hydro-power plants arranged in an hierarchical order from plant<br>
level to the unit levels. An ALSS engine module configured with on-line data in<br>
respect of the operational parameters of each of the plurality of generating<br>
machines,the engine module receiving project specific data from the ALSS<br>
configurator module for generating an optimum loading pattern based on a<br>
minimum cumulative discharge data determined via plurality of iterations on the<br>
actual turbine performance characteristics. The engine module transmitting<br>
command signals to a governor to load the machines optimally. An input and<br>
output interface operably connected to the modules which together constituting<br>
a system software. An ALSS hardware having a data acquisition means collecting<br>
field-data and converting the field signals to digital signals enabling the system<br>
software to read and compute the data. An apparatus operating under a series<br>
of sequentially arranged instructions contained in the system software causing<br>
the governor to actuate and optimally load individual generating machines.<br>
The Innovated system generates a series of sequentially arranged instructions<br>
leading to a loading of the machines sequentially corresponding to a discharge<br>
where turbine efficiency is best . The system while suggesting the loading<br>
pattern also takes care of the type of turbine installed at the power station<br>
including the recommended partial load operation.<br>
The system provides the plant operator with the data for optimal loading of the<br>
hydro plant based on the current load demand and the inputs available to the<br>
units. The criterion considered for determining a specific loading pattern as<br>
optimal is that the cumulative discharge associated with that pattern is minimal.<br>
The bad pattern generation and the subsequent instructions to the operator on<br>
the loading of individual units is carriedout individually and separately for<br>
different plants. The system software comprises two modules for example,<br>
ALSS-Configurator; and ALSS-Engine.<br>
The turbine designer is required to incorporate project specific data in the<br>
module to configure a system software for particular hydro project. The plant<br>
details will be provided in terms of a configuration. The hierarchy of the<br>
configuration constitutes, a Plant followed by Units in the plant. The Plant details<br>
include:<br>
Name of the Plant<br>
Location of the Plant<br>
Number of units in the plant<br>
Rated Speed<br>
Type of turbine<br>
Rated output<br>
Number of net working heads for which data is provided.<br>
Head loss vs. Design curve in case no instrument for reading net heads is<br>
available.<br>
The individual unit data will be:<br>
Maximum and minimum permissible load<br>
For each head, discharge vs. Load and efficiency vs. Load curves (either or<br>
both).<br>
All the data for the project will be stored in project specific files which will serve<br>
as input for the Engine module.<br>
AlSS-Engine:<br>
The data fed into the configurator serve as an input to the AtSS-Engine, which<br>
shall be ultimately used by the hydro plant operator for loading the plant<br>
optimally. It is configured with on-line input data for a specific plant, and include:<br>
Net head or Head Race &amp; Tail Race Levels.<br>
Current load demand/requirement.<br>
Status of unit ie. Running or under shutdown.<br>
Based on the current load demand and the on-line data in respect of the<br>
operational parameters of the individual units, the ALSS-Engine will compute the<br>
optimum loading pattern. The basis of optimization is the minimum cumulative<br>
discharge coming out of a large number of iterations on the actual turbine<br>
performance characteristics performed by the module. The module also<br>
computes savings that will result from adopting the optimized vis-avis non<br>
optimized loading pattern. The ALSS-Engine acts as a decision support tool for<br>
the hydro plant operator to optimally operate the plant. The system software<br>
shall be used to operate online for which a ALSS hardware is employed which<br>
conditions and acquire the field signals from a plurality of sensors to digital<br>
signals which can be read by the system software. The hardware is customized<br>
for the sensors with respect to the signal characteristics. The output data from<br>
the system software shall be fed to a microprocessor based electro-hydraulic<br>
governor (EHG) for actuating the strokes of the guide vane servomotors of the<br>
plant.<br>

EXAMPLES/PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The ALSS-H system has been extensively tested with actual plant data and the<br>
optimal loading patterns suggested by the program logic has been verified and<br>
validated. One of a typical example is explained below:-<br>
The main parameters of the project are as follows:<br>
a) No. x Rating : 4x100 MW<br>
b) Type of turbine : Vertical Francis<br>
c) Net H eads:<br>
i) Rated net head 69 M<br>
ii)Maxm. Net head : 75 M<br>
iii)Minm.Net head :S8M<br>
d) Design discharge (one machine) : 169.0 M3/sec<br>
e) Rated Speed : 142.8 rpm<br>
f) Runner Diameter (inlet) : 4400 mm<br>
Suppose 75% part load demand is there, the loading pattern of machines for<br>
300 MW output at 69.0 M net head can have various combination as follows:<br><br>
The option-1 of load distribution shows a gain of 27% in discharge amounting to<br>
8.10 MW of power. Hence, among the three options, the 1st one is most<br>
optimum with respect to load sharing among various units. This shall help power<br>
utility to optimally utilize the generating equipment and conserve the natural<br>
resource.<br>
