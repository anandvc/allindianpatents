MSTHOD OP OPERATING AN ACTUATOR AMD APPARATUS FOR CARRYIN5 OUT THE<br><br>
The invention  relates to a  method  of   operating an actuator that  is  used to clanp  and  release a chuck having a rod that  can  be axially displeured in  a  machine spindle for  actuating a clanping head with  jaws,   and where to start with for clanping a force   in  an   axial  clanping direction   on the rod  by means   of   the actuator until  the axial  position  of  the rod  is fixed  relative to the machine spindle,   and  after  self-locking is established the application  of  force in the clanping direction  by the actuator  on the rod is   suspended  and  remains   suspended while the chuck is  in  operation,   and to release the clanp the rod is displaced   by the actuator in  a  release direction that   is   opposite the claiming direction.      The invention further  relates  to an apparatus for carrying out  the method.<br>
Chucks  are known from the prior  art,   for   example from DE  140   638   Al   [US 6,568,888],   that   by means   of   collet  chucks   are used to clanp workpieces  having,   for   example,   a collet.      To actuate such chucks,   actuators,    also referred to  as   release units,    are used that  axially displace a rod  associated with the chuck,   and to clanp the workpiece the rod is  pulled in the direction  away from the collet  chuck and,   with  application  of  the necessary clanping force, is  held  in this  position   by the actuator,   the correct  positioning of  the rod  being assisted  by spring washer  assemblies  or helical spring washers.      The actuator   moves  the rod in the opposite direction to discontinue the clanping.      Although  such chucks with<br><br>
associated  actuators  and the method  required for their  operation have proven to be successful  in practice,   the known prior  art  has limitations when the balance quality nuts  be continually improved as  rotation  speeds  of  the spindle increases,   and in particular the spring-washer asexualizes   or  helical.   spring washers   have an  adverse effect   since they bear continuously on the rod.<br>
The object  of  the present  invention,   therefore,   is  to provide a  method  of  operating an  actuator that   may be carried out in the absence of   such  springs.      A further object   of  the invention is  to provide an  apparatus for carrying out  the method.<br>
The part   of  the object   of  the invention   relating to the method is  attained  by use of  the above-described   method that  is characterized in that  a force need  be  exerted  on the rod  only for claiming and  releasing,   whereas during operation  of  the chuck on the machine spindle,   which  is   rotating at   high  speed,   it   is  not necessary to  exert force on the rod.<br>
In  order to  shorten the resetting time,   for   example for changing tools,   it   should be noted that during clanping after    locking is   established it  is   also possible to reduce the application  of force during start-up of the machine swindler   i. e the machine spindle may already be started,   whereas  the force transmission from the actuator to the rod has  been   suspended.<br>
It  is   also within the scope of  the invention,   in particular from a safety standpoint,   that during release the application  of  force in the release direction  is   not   commenced until  the machine spindle has  reached  a standstill;    i. e    only after the machine spindle has   reached  a complete standstill   is  the force<br><br>
transinLssion chain between the actuator  and the rod  reestablished, in  order to avoid injury or dotage as the result  of  insxifficiently clamped workpieces.<br>
The part  of  the object   of  the invention  relating to the apparatus   is   attained  by the fact  that   a chuck is  provided having a rod that   is   supported  in  a   machine spindle so as  to be axially displaceable in  order to actuate a claiming head that  cooperates with the jaws,   the axial  position  of  the rod in the clanped position having been  secured  by self-locking,   and  an  actuator is provided that  in the self-locked position  of  the rod is decoupled from it  in  a positive-fit   manner.      By use of  this  design,   in particular negative effects  on the balance quality caused  by the part   oÂ£  the actuator necessary for  actuating the rod   may be prevented,   and in particular  so that  the connection  of  the rod to the actuator does  not   adversely affect  the balance quality.      These advantages   may be realized in  a particularly simple  tanner  by positioning the actuator  so as  not  to contact  the rod in the clanped position  of  the rod,   i. e    so that  the free-standing rod together with the entire machine spindle is  able to rotate without contact  with the actuating system<br>
In  one advantageous   embodiment,   the rod has  a first  wire-wound coil  that   is provided for interaction with  a  second wire-wound coil   of the machine spindle and coaxial  with the first  wire-wound coil  that  is coupled in  a contact-free manner with  a  stator of  the stationary actuator housing*      In principle,   this design forms   a linear   motor that   can   move the rod in the calcimine<br><br>
direction  or the release direction  as the resist  of different current  directions.<br>
One very particularly preferred   embodiment  is characterized in that the rod has  an  annular collar provided in  a piston chamber  of  a first  piston that  is  located in  a cylindrical chamber  of  the actuator that   nay be acted  on  by a pressure medium In this   embodiment    in contrast  to the embodiment  that   makes  use of   the wire-wound coilsâ    a contact   operational   method   of clanping and  releasing is  auk-lowedâ   it   being  ensured that  the rod together with its  annular collar  is  positioned without  contact  with the actuator during operation  of  the chuck,   since this  is  the key criterion for achieving high rotational   speeds with good  balance quality,   whereas during standstill,   contact   may be allowed for switching on  the chuck.<br>
It   is   also within the scope of  the invention that, starting from a center position,   the displacement   stroke of   the first piston in the cylindrical  chamber is  greater in  both directions than the displacement   stroke of  the annular collar in the piston chamber in  both displacement directions,    so that  the additional displacement  capability of  the first  piston  not   only allows  contact  to be made between the annular collar  and the piston chamber,    but   also allows  the necessary displacement   of  the rod for actuation  of  the chuck.<br>
It  is particularly preferred when a second piston is provided in  a second cylindrical  chamber in the actuator that   bears on the first  piston in the clipped position  of the rod.      For proper functioning of  this   apparatus  it   is   essential  that   the annular<br><br>
collar precisely maintains the center position in the piston chattber during operation,   this precise positioning being difficult to   ensure solely by controlling the pressure conditions  in the cylindrical  chancre      Use of  the second piston   easily provides  this assurance by establishing in the clanped position the correct position  of  the first piston and thus the position  of  the annular collar in  its piston chancier.<br>
To  establish the correct  position  of  the second piston in the clasped position,   the second piston has  a larger   effective diameter than the first piston,   and the opposite sides  of  the first piston  and the second piston in the clanped position  of  the rod are acted  on with   equal pressure via a three-way valve.<br>
It  is  also within the scope of  the invention that  for stroke control  a ring sensor is  associated with the actuator for interaction with  an indicator  associated with the rod,   so that this enibodiraent  offers the possibility of   monitoring the displacement  of the rod for introduction   of  the clanping force.<br>
A further alternative  embodiment  is  characterized  in that the actuator has  a rotary feed through fitting having a  manifold shaft  connected to the nachine spindle and a rotationally fixed manifold  housing that  carries  pressure medium connections  that   are used for  applying pressure to the two sides  of   a piston provided in a piston  chamber  and connected to the rod.      In this   embodiment  it is  important that  a connection to the rod  occurs without  contact with the actuator in  any operating position during,   i* e.    clanping, releasing,    or during operation,    but  that   in the clanped position the actuator is  decoupled from the rod in  a positive-fit   manner<br><br>
corresponding to the above-described requirements;    i. e    the pressure medium connections   are acted  on  by pressure only for switching on,   and  are switched  on for unpressurized  operation, since in particular  at  the desired high  rotational   speeds   of   up to 120,000   revolutions  per   minute the seals   are subjected to increased wear under pressure lieu.<br>
According to a further   embodiment,   a  spindle collar having a circumferential   groove is  provided  on the  machine spindle, and  at  least  two diametrically opposite pins   engage in the groove for  relieving the spindle during clanping and  release,   the pins being provided  on the axially displaceable e cylinder wall  of  the actuator,   and two springs  acting in the two displacement directions and  supported on the housing being associated with the cylinder wall  in  order to  establish  a center position  of  the pins following clanping and  reuse<br>
Alternatively or  additionally,   in  order to  establish  a center position  of the pins following clanping and  release a funnel-shaped  surface nay be associated with the cylinder wall,   and a centering  element   nay be associated with the housing,   in the simplest design the centering  element  being formed  by a spring-loaded ball.<br>
However,   the centering  element   nay also be formed  by a conical  pin that   nay be acted on  by a pressure medium<br>
A further   embodiment  having two pistons   associated with the actuator is  characterized in that  the first  piston  serves for with the clanping process  and  bears  on the annular  collar during clanping,   and a release piston that  can  be displaced independently<br><br>
of  the first piston  and that  bears  on the annular collar during release is provided in the actuator.<br>
The invention is     in greater detail   below with reference to the shown   endDodiinents   shown in the drawing.      Therein:<br>

FIG*    4  is   a view like FIG.    2,   of   a further   embodiment   of the actuator;<br>
FIG.    5   is   a view like FIG.    3  with  relief   of  the spindle <br>
FIG.    6   is   a view like FIG*    5,   in  an  alternative embodiment   of   relief   of  the spindly*    and<br>
FIG.    7   is   a further       of   an  actuator having two pistons.<br>
The drawing shows  a chuck used for clanping a workpiece 2 having a collet  1,   or for clanping a tool,   to which   end the chuck has  a rod  4  that   is   supported  so as to be axially displaceable in  a body 3  and that  is provided for actuating a clanping head 6  that cooperates  with  jaws  5,   namely,   by axial displacement  of  the rod  4 between  a release position  shown in the lower half   of FIG.    1   and a clanped position  shown in the upper half  of FIG.    1.      The workpiece 2  is clanped  by pulling the rod  4 from the release position into the clanped position  by means   of   an  actuator  20,    shown  in the drawing in FIGS.    2  through   4   and to be described  in  greater detail<br><br>
     by drawing back  jaws   7   and  a threaded  bolt   8   as  well   as   a threaded  ring 9  the clanping head 6   is   axial y displaced,   thereby radially displacing the outer   ends  10   of  the jaws  5   so as  to  make contact  with the collet  1.<br>
In the chuck  shown in FIG.    1,   it  is  noted that   a clanping sleeve 11   is  provided in the body 3   so as  to  be axially nondisplaceable,   the jaws  7   being axially guided in the clanping sleeve and having their inner faces  resting against  the rod  4,   the rod  4  having a conical  head  12,   and the jaws  7   having a tapered ring 13,   and the clanping sleeve 11  having an internal  conical surface 14,   resulting in  self-locking that  locks the axial  position of  the jaw outer   ends  7  when the rod  4   moves from the release position to the clanped position,   without  the actuator having to exerting additional  tension  on the rod  4.      The force applied  by the actuator  20   through the rod   4  is  thus   stored,    so to  speak,    by means câ  this   self-locking action,   and the secure clasping of  the workpiece 2   at  its collet  1  is   ensured without  having to use a tension  spring that  with its  spring force would have to  ensure the axial  position  of  the rod   4 with  respect  to the body 3   or the clanping sleeve 11  in the clanped position.      The security of  the clanping therefore is  not   jeopardized  by fatigue of   the tension spring.      In addition,   as the result  of  using self-locking,   the rod 4,   which is   not   engaged  by a tension   spring,   is   able to rotate with the entire spindle,   i. e,   the body 3,   without  having to be connected with  its   actuator  20,    enabling the balance quality to  be improved and the rotational   speed to be increased.<br><br>
The drawing also shows  that  the conical  head  12   merges with the rod  4  by a radially extending shoulder 15,   and that  the jaw outer   ends  7  have an inner  shoulder 16  for   engagement  with the shoulder 15,   and that the jaw outer   ends  7  together with their inner  shoulder 16   are able to be spread  by the shoulder 15   in the axi2LL   region  of  the conical   inner  surface 14  of  the clanking sleeve 11.      In the enbodiment  shown in the drawing,   the conical  haul 12 has  an  apex angle of 6E,   whereas  the conical  inner  surface 14  of<br>
the clanping sleeve 11   has   an  apex angle of   12E*       The inclination of  the inner circumferential   surface and  of  the outer circumflex rental   surface of  the tapered ring 13  correspond to the inclination  of  the corresponding contacting coicponents.<br>
The operation  of  the apparatus  is   briefly y described below.       Starting from the release position  shown  in the lower  half of   the figure,   the actuator  20   exerts   a tension  on the rod   4  that moves  the rod  4 to the left  in the drawing.      During this displacement,   as  a result  of  the contact  of  the inner  shoulder 16 of  the jaw outer   ends  7   against  the shoulder  15   aÂ£   the rod   4,   the rod  4 first   entrains the jaw outer   ends  7  that  to avoid imbalance are guided  relative to the clanping sleeve in two   elongated holes 17,   and  by means  of  the threaded  bolt  8,   threaded  ring 9,   and clanping head 6   the jaws   5  with their   jaw  outer   ends   10   pivot radially outward  and come to rest  against  an undercut  18   of  the collet  1.      The interaction  of  the shoulder 15  with the inner shoulder 16   restarts  in  rapid  axial  displacement   of   the clanping head 6,    and  after traveling a predetermined  axial  distance the inner  shoulder 16   of  the jaws  7   is   able to disengage from the<br><br>
shoulder 15,   and with the inner  surface of the tapered  ring 13 comes to rest  against  the conical  head 12  while at  the same time being pressed with the outer circumferential   surface agarâs  the tapered  ring 13  of the clipping sleeveâs 11.      The jaws  7   are thus carried  along in the axial direction  only to a  slight degree during continued  axial.  displacement  of  the rod  4,   but  with increasing force between the conical  head 12  and the clanping sleeve 11  the jaws  are wedged until   self-locking is  attained that  provides the established clanping force when the tension from the actuator  20   is no longer  applied to the rod  4.<br>
To release the chuck,   the rod  4  is   moved to the right from the clipped position to the release position,   thereby unlocking the jaws  7  from the wedged conical   head  12   and the claiming sleeve 11  and also displacing the rod  4  relative to the jaws  7  until  the rod =s contact   surface 19  come to rest  against the threaded  ring 9â   and the inner  shoulder 16   is  once more able to engage behind the shoulder 15   of  the rod  4.      Continued   movement  of the rod  4 displaces the clipping head 6,   causing the jaws  5  with their  jaw outer   ends   10   to release the  2.<br>
The clanping and  release of  this  chuck  may optionally be acconplished by use of  one of the actuators  20   shown in FIGS.    2 through  4 that   are all  characterized in that the force transmission chain from the actuator  20  to the rod  4  is  interrupted  in the clanped position  of  the rod  4.      In the embodiments   of  FIGS.    2   and  3 this  is  accoziplished by the fact that  in the clanped position  of the rod   4  the actuators   20   are out   of  contact  with  the rod,   whereby in the  embodiment  in FIG.    2,   the rod   4  is  provided  with  a first<br><br>
wireâwound coil   21  that  is  provided for interaction with  a  second wire-wound coil   22  carried  on the machine spindle 3,   coaxiaaiy surrounding with the first  wireâwound coil   21,   and  coupled  in  a contact-free scanner with  a  stator  associated with the stationary actuator  housing 20   [23],      This   actuator  20   acts  in  a contact-free manners  on the rod   4  in  eJ.1   operating positions     for  calquing and releasing as  well   as during operation  of  the chuck when the latter is  rotated together with the machine spindle 3  at  high   speeds.<br>
FIG*    3   shows     in which the rod  4 has  an annular collar  26   that  is provided in  a piston chairiber  27   of   a first  piston  28  that  is located in  a cylindrical  charier  29  of  the actuator that   inlay be acted  on  by a pressure median   the displacement   stroke of  the first  piston  28  in the cylindrical chairiber  29/    starting from a center position,    being greater  in   both directions than the displacement   stroke of  the annular collar  26   in the piston chairiber 27  in  both displacement directions,   so that  in addition to the displacement  of  the first  piston  28  for contacting the annular collar 26  with the axial   end  and  back faces   of  the piston chairiber,   the continued displacement   nay force actuation  of the clanping head 6.      However,   to   ensure that  contact  with the  end and  back faces   of  the piston chamber  27  is  once again  released for the annular collar 26  when the rod  4 has  assumed its working position  after  achieving  self-locking,   a  second piston  31  is provided  in  a  second  cylindrical  chairiber  30   in the actuator  20   that acts   on the first  piston  28   in the clanped position  of  the rod  4, the second piston  31  having a larger   effective diameter than the<br><br>
