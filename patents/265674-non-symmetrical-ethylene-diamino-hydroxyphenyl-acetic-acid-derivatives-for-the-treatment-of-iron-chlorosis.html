				<td>New products for the treatment of the iron chlorosis<br>
Field of the invention<br>
This invention relates to new non-symmetrical ethylene diamino<br>
hidroxyphenyl acetic acid derivatives. These products are useful for the<br>
treatment of iron chlorosis.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Iron chlorosis is a nutritional plant disorder which results in a decrease in the<br>
amount of chlorophyll and in the yellowing or whitening of normally green<br>
plant tissue. It is a widespread problem in agriculture that affects the<br>
development of many crops provoking a decrease yield.<br>
Attempts have long been made to correct this iron deficiency by feeding the<br>
plants with iron in assimilable form, originally in the form of ferric salts. Ferric<br>
salts act to a certain extent by foliar penetration, but are substantially<br>
ineffectual when used for soil treatment. It is through the roots that the<br>
penetration of iron is at its most effective in controlling chlorosis. In this<br>
connection, simple iron salts have been replaced by iron chelates which are<br>
hydrosoluble complexes consisting of an iron atom attached to several points<br>
of a single organic molecule known as chelates or co-ordinates. Some of<br>
these products known as hexadentates, such as complexes of iron with<br>
ethylene diamine tetracetic acid (EDTA) or with diethylene triamine pentacetic<br>
acid (DTPA) or with N,N'-ethylene-bis-(hydroxyphenyl)glycines (EDDHA),<br>
have been successfully used against chlorosis.<br>
N,N'-ethylene-bis(2-hydroxyphenyl)glycine (o,o-EDDHA) is often described as<br>
one of the most favorable compounds for complexing metals, and being most<br>
suitable for the use as a plant nutrient or fertilizer because the complexation<br>
affinity to iron is particularly strong. The ferric chelate of o,o-EDDHA shows a<br>
coordination number of 6 and is widely used for agrochemical purposes as a<br>
plant nutrient or plant fertilizer, and for the treatment of chlorosis in crop<br>
plants.<br>
The N,N'-ethylene-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-glycinyl-(4-hydroxyphenyl)glycine (o,p-<br>
EDDHA) is also known in the art. Contrary to o,o-EDDHA, in the o,p-EDDHA<br><br><br>
isomer one of the hydroxy groups is in the para- position of the benzene ring.<br>
For this reason, the ferric chelate of o,p-EDDHA shows a coordination<br>
number of 5 and its complexation affinity to iron is weaker than that of 0,0-<br>
EDDHA. This compound has often being regarded as an undesired by-<br>
product being incurred by the manufacturing process of 0,0-EDDHA.<br>
Gomez-Gallego et al, (c.f. Chem.Eur.J. 2005, 77,5997-6005) propose a<br>
model for explaining the reduction of the Fe(lll)-o,o-EDDHA chelate by a<br>
ferric chelate reductase. According to it, the reduction of said chelate does<br>
not take place on the complex in the octahedral closed form, wherein the 6<br>
chelating points of 0,0-EDDHA are coordinated to the Fe(lll), but on a<br>
hexacoordinate open species formed at the acid pH of the rhizosphere. As<br>
showed in Scheme 5 of said report, one of the hydroxy groups in the ortho-<br>
position would not be coordinated with the Fe(lll), thus generating a vacant<br>
coordination site that would be filed with a water molecule. The complex<br>
Fe(lll)-o,p-EDDHA, wherein one of the hydroxy groups is in the para- position,<br>
would already be in the required open form and could be reduced directly by<br>
the enzyme.<br>
WO2005/095305 discloses isomeric mixtures comprising both (0,0-EDDHA)<br>
and (o,p-EDDHA) , wherein the molar ratio of (o,p-EDDHA) to (0,0-EDDHA) is<br>
higher than 0.8 : 1, as nutrients for agricultural crop plants and agents for<br>
treatment of chlorosis in such plants.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The properties of the commercially available chelating agents currently used<br>
for the treatment of iron deficiency related plant diseases (e.g. iron chlorosis),<br>
such as those based in EDDHA and known derivatives thereof, are still not<br>
completely satisfactory. For instance, it has been observed that current<br>
chlorosis treatments based on 0,0-EDDHA show a delayed effect in plants.<br>
WO2005/095305 proposes to solve this problem by employing isomeric<br>
mixtures of 0,0-EDDHA and o,p-EDDHA, as said above. However, o,p-<br>
EDDHA/Fe3+ shows lower stability than o,o-EDDHA/Fe3+. (Yunta et al. Journal<br>
of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, 2003, 51, 5391-5399) so it is quite<br>
reactive in soils.<br><br><br>
Properties that are desirable in a compound useful for the treatment of iron<br>
chlorosis are described in Lucena, J.J. Iron Fertilizers in Correcting Iron<br>
Deficiencies in Plants. Chapter 5, In Iron Nutrition in Plants and Rhizospheric<br>
Microorganism 2006, pp 103-127, Springer-Verlag Academic Publishers.<br>
The problem to be solved by the present invention is to provide alternative<br>
products that may be useful for the treatment of iron deficiency related plant<br>
diseases. These products may have improved properties regarding the<br>
currently known treatments.<br>
The solution is based on the fact that the present inventors have identified<br>
that by eliminating one of the carboxylic groups of EDDHA and maintaining or<br>
modulating the hydroxyphenyl groups, the chelating affinity for polyvalent<br>
metals, particularly for iron, is retained, while some other properties may be<br>
improved, particularly those that make them useful for the treatment of iron<br>
chlorosis. See working examples 1 -7 herein for a further description.<br>
Accordingly, a first aspect of the invention relates to a compound of formula<br>
(I):<br><br>
wherein<br>
X1 is a C6 or a C10 aromatic system having a hydroxy group in the alpha<br>
position, being optionally substituted by up to four substituents independently<br>
selected from the group consisting of: phospho, sulfo, halo, carboxy, acetoxy,<br>
C1-C4 alkoxy or linear or branched C1-C4 alkyl.<br>
X2 is a C6 or a C10 aromat ic system having a hydroxy group in the alpha<br>
position, or a five or six membered heterocycle having in the alpha position a<br>
heteroatom selected from the group consisting of N, O and S, optionally<br>
comprising other N, O or S atoms in their structure, and having from 0-3<br>
double bonds, said aromatic, or heterocyclic system being optionally<br><br><br>
substituted by up to four substituents independently selected from the group<br>
consisting of: phospho, sulfo, halo, carboxy, acetoxy, C1-C4 alkoxy, linear or<br>
branched C1-C4 alkyl.<br>
Y is (CH2)n or is a xylylene group of formula:<br><br>
n is an integer selected from 2, 3 and 4,<br>
R1, R2 are independently selected from the group consisting of H, linear or<br>
branched C1-C4 alkyl, C6 or C10 aryl.<br>
In a second aspect the invention relates to a process for preparing a<br>
compound of formula (I) as defined in the first aspect of the invention and in<br>
its corresponding embodiments, which process comprises the step of<br>
reducing a compound of formula (II):<br><br>
wherein X1, X2 and Y are as defined above, in an appropriate solvent system,<br>
in the presence of a reducing agent.<br>
In a third aspect the invention relates to the use of a compound of formula (I),<br>
as defined in the first aspect of the invention and its corresponding<br>
embodiments, as a complex forming agent for polyvalent metals.<br>
In a fourth aspect the invention relates to a chelate of a compound of the<br>
formula (I), as defined in the first aspect of the invention and its<br>
corresponding embodiments, with one or more polyvalent metals.<br>
In a fifth aspect the invention relates to an agrochemical composition<br>
comprising a compound of formula (I), as defined in the first aspect of the<br>
invention and its corresponding embodiments, or a polivalent metal chelate<br>
thereof.<br><br><br>
In a sixth aspect the invention relates to the use of a compound, as defined in<br>
the first aspect of the invention and its corresponding embodiments, or a<br>
polyvalent metal chelate thereof, for the preparation of a composition for<br>
treating an iron deficiency related plant disease.<br>
In a seventh aspect the invention relates to an intermediate of formula (II):<br><br>
wherein X1, X2 and Y are as defined above, in solid form.<br>
In a eighth aspect the invention relates to the use of the intermediate of<br>
formula (II) as defined in the seventh aspect of the invention and its<br>
corresponding embodiments, for the preparation of a compound of formula (I),<br>
as defined in the first aspect of the invention and its corresponding<br>
embodiments.<br>
Without whishing to be bound by theory, as reported in Chem. Eur. J. 2005,<br>
11, 5997, the effectiveness of Fe(lll)-o,o-EDDHA to relief iron chlorosis<br>
requires the generation of a vacant coordination site. This fact explains the<br>
high efficiency of o,p-EDDHA a compound in which one of the phenolic<br>
groups is unable to coordinate the metal. Advantageously the new<br>
compounds described in the invention have only five groups able to<br>
coordinate with the metal. This point should be essential for their activity.<br>
Furthermore, most of the derivatives of EDDHA known in the art and<br>
employed for the treatment of iron deficiency related plant diseases are<br>
symmetrical compounds, except for the o,p-EDDHA, which is an isomer of<br>
EDDHA. On the contrary, all the compounds of formula (I) are non-<br>
symmetrical compounds, since they lack one of the two carboxylic groups of<br>
EDDHA. Therefore, the known methods for the preparation of EDDHA<br>
derivatives were not directly applicable to the compounds of the invention.<br>
This has forced the inventors to develop a new method of synthesis for<br>
preparing the said compounds of formula (I).<br><br><br>

invention is the following:<br>
To a solution of the ligand of formula (I) in NaOH (1:3 ligand:NaOH molar<br>
ratio), is added a solution of the equimolar amount of FeCI3-6H2O in water.<br>
During the addition, the pH of the solution should be maintained between 6.0-<br>
8.0 by addition of NaOH or HCI, and finally adjusted to 7. The final solution is<br>
filtered through 0.45 urn cellulose membranes before use.<br>
Example 12: Determination of Titrimetric purity of the chelating agent<br>
Photometric titration<br>
Chelating agent solution was prepared by dissolving an amount of chelating<br>
agent in the necessary amount of NaOH solution. Then pH is adjusted to 6 by<br>
the addition of MES biological buffer [2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid]<br>
and maintaining at this pH with NaOH solution during the titration. Ionic<br>
strength is fixed at 0.1 M with NaCI and upper atmosphere was N2free of C02<br>
The test solution was placed in a thermostated jacketed reaction vessel<br>
(i.e.100 ml or 150 ml capacity) with an airtight cap fitted with gas inlet and<br>
outlet tubes, the combined pH glass electrode, the photometric detector and<br>
two piston burettes, tip extending below the surface of the solution, and a<br><br><br>
magnetic stirrer. The photometric titration consisted of the addition of a Fe(lll)<br>
standard solution, previously standardized by Atomic Absorption<br>
Spectroscopy, to the chelating agent until the absorbance at 480 nm presents<br>
no changes. End-point titration could be calculated for two linear segments'<br>
intersection and also using smoothed second derivative method.<br>
Potentiometric titration<br>
The chelating agent purities could also be determined by potentiometric<br>
titrations with a Cu2+ ion selective electrode in the same conditions as before.<br>
The chelating agent solution is titrated with Cu(ll) solution using selective<br>
Cu(ll) electrode and reference electrode, Cu2+ free cation is measured with<br>
the selective electrode. The end-point of the potentiometric titrations could be<br>
determined by Gran equation method or using the first derivative method.<br>
Previously, the Cu(ll) solution used as titrant solution is standardize with<br>
EDTA-Na2 solution and the selective electrode slope is determined by titration<br>
of NaCI solution fixed at pH=6 with Cu(ll) as titrant solution.<br>
Example 13: Determination of agrochemical activity<br>
Efficacy of Fe chelates to provide Fe to soybean plants in hydroponics.<br>
Soybean seeds (Glycine max L. cv. Stine 0480) were germinated at 30<br>
°C and 60% RH on paper moistened with 1 M CaSO4 in dark for 2 days.<br>
Afterwards, seedlings were placed in 10 L containers (50 seedlings per<br>
container) filled with a 1/5 diluted EDTA buffered nutrient solution<br>
(macronutrients (mM)- 1.0 Ca(NO3)2j 0.9 KNO3, 0.3 MgSO4&gt; 0.1 KH2PO4;<br>
cationic micronutrients (uM)- 5.0 EDTA/Fe3+, 2.5 MnSO4, 1.0 CuSO4, 10<br>

35 NaCI, 10 H3B03, 0.05 Na2Mo04; 0.1 mM HEPES) for 6 days. On the 7th<br>
day, in order to induce Fe chlorosis, seedlings were transferred to 12 L<br>
polypropylene buckets containing aerated full strength EDTA buffered<br>
nutrient solution but without Fe3+-chelate. Plants were grown under these<br>
conditions until clear symptoms of Fe deficiency were observed (7 days) and<br>
then plants were placed in 2 L pots (6 plants per pot) covered with black<br>
plastic to avoid light exposure. The effect of different Fe chelates and doses<br><br><br>
were compared as Fe sources. Chelates used in the treatments were 0,0-<br>
EDDHA/Fe3+, o,p-EDDHA/Fe3\ EDTA/Fe3+ and Example 1/Fe3+. The last one<br>
is the Fe chelate of the compound of the example 1: 2-(2-((2-<br>
hydroxybenzyl)amino)ethylamino)-2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)acetic acid (DCHA).<br>
Nutrient solution contained macronutrients and anionic imicronutrients as for<br>
the seedling period and the following cationic micronutrients composition:<br>
OiM) 1.0 MnSO4, 0.5 CuSO4, 0.5 ZnSO4l 0.1 NiCI2 and 0.1 CoSO4. Also, 1g-L"<br>
1 of CaC03 was added to the nutrient solution to buffer pH at 7.5 and to<br>
simulate conditions of a calcareous soil. Plants were grown for 21 days in this<br>
nutrient solution in a growth chamber provided with fluorescent and sodium<br>
vapour lamps with a 16 h/30 °C and 50% humidity day and 8 h/25 °C and<br>
70% humidity night regime. Water was added every 2 days and the nutrient<br>
solution was renewed every 7 days. Treatments were replicated four times in<br>
a completely randomised design. Plants were harvested after 7, 14 and 21<br>
days.<br>
During the experiment, SPAD readings with a chlorophyll-meter (Minolta<br>
SPAD-502) were taken for all leaf stages (average of two or three readings<br>
per stage) every second day. Only values measured for the youngest fully<br>
open leaves (the 2nd stage at the 2nd day, the third at the 10th day and the<br>
fourth at the 20th day) are here presented (Table 1)<br>
Table 1. Effects of Fe chelates treatments on the SPAD index measured.<br><br><br><br>
Different letters in the columns denote significant differences (α=0.05) among<br>
treatments according to the Duncan Test<br>
The chlorophyll and the recovery of plants after the treatments application<br>
were estimated by the SPAD index. Table 1 shows the time course of this<br>
parameter. Two days after the treatment application, plants treated with<br>
10 uM o,p-EDDHA/Fe3+ showed the highest SPAD index values but it only<br>
showed significant differences with 5 uM o,o-EDDHA/Fe3+, 5 uM EDTA/Fe3+<br>
and -Fe treatments. Ten days after, plants treated with 5 uM and 10 uM<br>
Example 1/Fe3+ and 10uM o,p-EDDHA/Fe3+ had significantly regreened in<br>
relation to 5 uM o,o-EDDHA/Fe3+, 5 uM and 10uM EDTA/Fe3+and -Fe<br>
treatments. At the end of the experiment (20 days after the treatments<br>
application), regardless of the doses, plants treated with Example 1, o,o-<br>
EDDHA and o,p-EDDHA Fe chelates (T1, T2, T3, T4, T5 and T6) had<br>
completely regreened showing significant SPAD index values concerning 5<br>
μM and 10 uM doses of EDTA/Fe3+ and -Fe treatments.<br>
Considering the low doses applied and the trend observed, we can conclude<br>
that the product obtained in Example 1 presents a fast action to correct iron<br>
chlorosis, similar to o,p-EDDHA, but higher than o,o-EDDHA.<br>
Root and shoot were separated and washed using Tween 80 (Merck) and HCI<br>
solution and fresh and dry (after oven dry procedure) weights were<br>
determined. Samples were ground and after dry digestion in a muffle furnace<br>
(480 °C), ashes are dissolved in HCI. Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn were analysed by<br>
atomic absorption spectrometry.<br>
In Table 2 the Fe content in the plants in each sampling time for the<br>
treatments with the lower Fe application is presented. It can be observed that<br><br><br>
the novel compound Example 1/Fe3+ is able to provide significantly higher<br>
amounts of iron and faster in this experimental conditions than the other<br>
treatments, even more than o,p-EDDHA in the third sampling time. However,<br>
when a large doses of Fe is used (10 uM, table 3) differences are only<br>
significant respect the treatment with EDTA/Fe3+. It can be concluded that<br>
Example 1/Fe3+ can be used in lower concentration than other chelates to<br>
correct the iron chlorosis.<br>

chelates<br><br>

Efficacy of Fe chelates to provide Fe to soybean plants in soil conditions<br>
Soybean seeds (Glycine max L. cv. Stine 0480) were germinated at 30 °C<br>
and 60% RH on paper moistened with 1 M CaSO4 in dark for 2 days.<br>
Afterwards, seedlings were placed in 10 L containers (50 seedlings per<br>
container) filled with a 1/5 diluted EDTA buffered nutrient solution<br>
(macronutrients (mM)- 1.0 Ca(NO3)2, 0.9 KNO3, 0.3 MgSO4, 0.1 KH2PO4;<br>
cationic micronutrients (μM)- 5.0 EDTA/Fe3+, 2.5 MnSO4, 1.0 CuSO4, 10<br>
ZnSO4, 1.0 CoSO4&gt; 1.0 NiCI2, '115.5 Na2EDTA; anionic micronutrients (uM)-<br>
35 NaCI, 10 H3BO3, 0.05 Na2MoO4; 0.1 mM HEPES) for 4 days. Then, in<br>
order to induce Fe chlorosis, nutrient solution without iron was used for two<br>
more days and then plants were transplanted in 1 L pots (3 plants per pot)<br>
containing 700 g of a calcareous soil (380 mg-Kg-1 calcium carbonate, 89 g<br>
Kg-1 CaCO 3 active, pH 7.70) and 300 g of lime sand covered with black<br>
plastic to avoid light exposure. The effect of different Fe chelates were<br>
compared as Fe sources: o,o-EDDHA/Fe3+, o,p-EDDHA/Fe3+, EDTA/Fe3+ and<br>
Example 1/Fe3+. The last one is the Fe chelate of the compound of the<br>
example	1:	2-(2-((2-hydroxybenzyl)amino)ethylamino)-2-(2-<br><br><br>
hydroxyphenyl)acetic acid. Plants were grown for 21 days in this soil<br>
conditions in a growth chamber provided with fluorescent and sodium vapour<br>
lamps with a 16 h/30 °C and 50% humidity day and 8 h/25 °C and 70%<br>
humidity night regime. Treatments were replicated five times in a completely<br>
randomised design. Single plants were harvested after 2, 7 and 21 days.<br>
During the experiment, SPAD readings with a chlorophyll-meter (Minolta<br>
SPAD-502) were taken for all leaf stages (average of two or three readings<br>
per stage) every second day. Values measured for the 2nd stage at the 2nd<br>
day, the third at the 12th day and the fourth and fifth at the 22th day) are here<br>
presented (Table 4).<br>
Table 4. Effects of Fe chelates treatments on the SPAD index measured in<br>
the soil experiment<br><br>
Different letters in the columns denote significant differences (a=0.05) among<br>
treatments according to the Duncan Test.<br>
All chelate treatments present higher SPAD indexes than control, as shown in<br>
Figure 1. This and the visual symptoms indicate that the recovery from<br>
chlorosis using these chelates was complete. Two days after the treatment<br>
application, plants treated with o,p-EDDHA/Fe3+ and Example 1/Fe3+<br>
presented the better recovery, due to the fast action of these compounds, and<br><br><br>
after that it is the treatment with the o,o-EDDHA/Fe3+ the one which gives the<br>
highest values but similar to Example 1/Fe3+.<br>
In each sampling time shoots were separated and washed using Tween 80<br>
(Merck) and HCI solution and fresh and dry (after oven dry procedure)<br>
weights were determined. Samples were ground and after dry digestion in a<br>
muffle furnace (480 °C), ashes were dissolved in HCI. Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn<br>
were analysed by atomic absorption spectrometry.<br>
In Figure 2 the dry weight obtained for the shoots is presented. Again the<br>
Example 1/Fe3+ revealed as an efficient Fe chlorosis corrector. Also in Figure<br>
3 the iron concentration in leaves is shown for the three sampling times. The<br>
three iron chelates considerably increase the Fe concentration with respect to<br>
the control.<br>
From this experiment, with only one treatment application, we can conclude<br>
that the product obtained in Example 1 is efficient to solve iron chlorosis in<br>
highly calcareous conditions. Its efficacy is related with its fast action<br>
mechanism.<br><br><br>
