 "A MOTORCYCLE WITH A FUEL BATTERY MOUNTED THEREON"<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan,<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The following specification particularly invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:describes the <br><br>
The present invention relates to a motorcycle with a fuel battery mounted thereon.<br>
Fuel battery mounted motorcycles are known, for example, from Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Hei 3-109126 entitled "Fuel Battery Mounted Motorcycle".<br><br><br>
As shown in FIG. 1 of the above document, the above technique discloses an electric motorcar 1 using a fuel battery 13 as an energy source, wherein the fuel battery 13 is disposed in a lower central portion of a vehicular body 2 (note: reference numerals are cited from the document).<br>
In the case of using the fuel battery 13 as an energy source, as will be described later, the motorcycle 1 must be provided with, in addition to the fuel battery 13, a fuel tank for storing methanol, a reformer for generating hydrogen, a secondary battery for storing an electric power generated by the fuel battery 13, and the like.  Further, in the case of mounting a fuel battery like the fuel battery 13 on a motorcycle, the layout of the fuel battery, reformer, secondary battery, and the like becomes important.  The principle of power generation by a fuel battery and one example of a fuel battery system will be hereinafter described, [o-o-e-er<br>
FIGS. 15(a) and 15(b) are diagrams illustrating the principle of power generation by a fuel battery, wherein FIG. 15(a) shows the principle of electrolysis of water, and FIG. 15(b) shows the principle of power generation by the fuel battery.<br><br><br>
Referring to FIG. 15(a), the electrolytic process of water (H20) is performed by filling a water tank 101 with water (H20) in which an electrolyte such as sulfuric acid (H2S04) has been dissolved; setting electrodes 102 and 103, each of which is typically made from platinum, in the water tank 101; covering the electrodes 102 and 103 with containers 104 and 105, respectively; and applying a current, from a DC power source 106, between the electrodes 102 and 103, whereby oxygen gas (02) is generated on the electrode 102 side taken as the plus side and hydrogen gas (H2) is generated on the electrode 103 side taken as the minus side.  In the figure, an arrow (e") designates the flow of electrons and an arrow (H+) designates the flow of hydrogen ions.<br>
Referring to FIG. 15(b), the power generation process is performed in accordance with steps reversed to those shown in FIG. 15(a), that is, by filling the container 104 with oxygen gas (02) and the container 105 with hydrogen gas (H2) ; connecting a load 107 between the electrodes 102 and 103; and making the oxygen gas (02) and hydrogen gas (H2) electrochemically react with each other in water (H20)   in which sulfuric acid (HzS04)   as  an electrolyte has been dissolved, whereby a current flows<br><br><br>
in the load 107, and the oxygen gas (02) is bonded to the hydrogen gas (H2) to produce water (H20).<br>
In this way, as shown in FIG. 5(b), the process of power generation of a fuel battery is reversed to the process of electrolysis of water shown in FIG. 5(a).  The fuel battery system will be described with reference to FIG. 16.<br>
FIG. 16 is a block diagram showing one example of the fuel battery system. A fuel battery system 110 includes a fuel tank 111 for storing methanol; a reformer 112 for generating hydrogen from methanol and water; a fuel battery 113 for making hydrogen generated by the reformer 112 electrochemically react with oxygen in air; a first pump 115 for supplying outside air to the fuel battery 113 via an air cleaner 114; a second pump 116 for supplying hydrogen from the reformer 112 to the fuel battery 113; a catalyzer 117 for receiving water vapor from the fuel battery 113 and carbon dioxide gas from the reformer 112 via the fuel battery 113 and for reducing the amount of carbon dioxide gas; a water tank 118 for receiving water from the catalyzer 117; a secondary battery 119 for storing an electric power generated by the fuel battery 113; and a motor 122 connected to the<br><br><br>
secondary battery 119 via a control unit 121.  In addition, the secondary battery 119 also functions to store an electric power generated by the motor 122.<br>
In the figure, a hollow arrow (CH3OH) designates the flow of methanol; a hollow arrow (H2) is the flow of hydrogen gas; a hollow arrow (02) is the flow of oxygen gas; a hollow arrow (H20 + C02) is the flow of water vapor and carbon dioxide gas; and a hollow arrow (H20) is the flow of water.<br>
[Problem to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
As described above, in the case of using the fuel battery 113 as an energy source of a motorcycle (not shown), it is required to provide, in addition to the fuel battery 113, the fuel tank 111 for storing methanol, the reformer 112 for generating hydrogen, the secondary battery 119 for storing an electric power generated by the fuel battery 113, and the like; and in the case of actually mounting these fuel battery 113, fuel tank 111, reformer 112, and the like on a motorcycle, it is required to examine the layout of the fuel battery system 110 including the fuel battery 113, fuel tank 111, reformer 112, and the like from the viewpoint of various factors such as the weight balance, maintenance, and<br><br><br>
