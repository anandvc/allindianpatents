				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to substituted thieno[2,3-^]pyridine-S-carboxamide and 2-thia-4-aza-indene-6-carboxamide derivatives, to methods for their preparation, to compositions containing them, and to methods and use for clinical treatment of diseases resulting from autoimmunity and pathologic inflammation, and of malignant tumours. Examples of such autoimmune diseases are multiple sclerosis, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and psoriasis. Other diseases where inflammation plays a major role are diseases such as asthma, atherosclerosis, stroke and Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, the types of solid tumours that are especially inhibited by the compounds of the present invention include, for example, breast cancers, colon cancers, Kaposi's sarcoma, lung cancers, ovarian cancers, prostatic cancers, and skin cancers. More particularly, the present invention relates to thieno[2,3-b]pyridine-5-carboxamide derivatives.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Autoimmune diseases, e.g., multiple sclerosis (MS), insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (EDDM), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and psoriasis represent assaults by the body's immune system which may be systemic in nature, or else directed at individual organs in the body. They appear to be diseases in which the immune system makes mistakes and, instead of mediating protective functions, becomes the aggressor (1).<br>
MS is the most common acquired neurologic disease of young adults in Western Europe and North America. It accounts for more disability and financial loss, both in lost income and in medical care, than any other neurologic disease of this age group. There are approximately a total of 1.000.000 cases of MS in the United States and Europe.<br>
Although the cause of MS is unknown, advances in brain imaging, immunology, and molecular biology have increased researchers' understanding of this disease. Several therapies are currently being used to treat MS, but no single treatment has demonstrated dramatic treatment efficacy. Current treatment of MS fells into three categories: treatment of acute exacerbations, modulation of progressive disease, and therapy for specific symptoms.<br>
MS affects the central nervous system and involves a demyelination process, i.e., the myelin sheaths are lost whereas the axons are preserved. Myelin provides the isolating material that enables rapid nerve impulse conduction. Evidently, in demyelination, this property is lost Although the pathogenic mechanisms responsible for MS are not understood, several lines of evidence indicate that demyelination has an immunopathologic basis. The pathologic lesions, the plaques, are characterised by infiltration of immunologically active cells such as macrophages and activated T cells (2).<br>
In US Fat No. 5,219,864 some thieno[2,3-fc]pyridine and thieno[3,2-&amp;]pyridine derivatives represented by formula (A)<br>
(Figure Remove)wherein Z represents pyridyl are claimed as immunoregulators and for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis.In WO 94/29295 compounds of general formula (B) are disclosed<br>
(Figure Remove)wherein Y among others representsviz. thieno[3,2-t]pyridine derivatives, and N represents abicyclic heterocyclic group containing at least one nitrogen atom, RS represents lower alkyl and R6 represents hydroxy, and which possess immunomodulating activity, anti-inflammatory activity and anti-cancer activity.DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONA primary objective of the present invention is to provide novel thieno[2,3-A]pyridine-5-carboxamide and 2-tbia-4-aza-indene-6-carboxamide derivatives, which by virtue of their pharmacological profile, with high potency in experimental models and low level of side-effects, are considered to be of value in the treatment of diseases resulting from autoimmunity and pathologic inflammation, and malignant tumours. The present invention relates to novel substituted thieno[2,3-&amp;]pyridine-5-carboxamide derivatives and2-thia-4-aza-indene-6-carboxamide derivatives, to methods for their preparation, to compositions containing them, and to methods and use for clinical treatment of diseases resulting from autoimmunity and pathologic inflammation, and of malignant tumours. Examples of such autoimmune diseases are multiple sclerosis, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and psoriasis, and other diseases where inflammation plays a major role are diseases such as asthma, atherosclerosis, stroke and Alzheimer's disease.The types of solid tumours that are especially inhibited by the compounds of the present invention include, for example, breast cancers, colon cancers, Kaposi's sarcoma, lung cancers, ovarian cancers, prostatic cancers, and skin cancers. The approach we have chosen is to inhibit the tumour-induced angiogenesis and to stimulate the host immune system to evoke/enhance an antitumour response.<br>
More particularly, the present invention relates to novel thieno[2,3-6]pyridine-S-carboxamide derivatives.<br>

Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) as a model for autoimmune inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) has been the most widely used model far the human disease multiple sclerosis.<br>
Autoimmunity to type II collagen can experimentally be induced in certain strains of mice or<br>
rats and may lead to the development of polyarthritis. The collagen induced arthritis has several features in common with the human disorder rheumatoid arthritis.<br>
The compounds of general formula (I) as well as some prior art/reference compounds were assayed for inhibition of acute experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (aEAE) hi mice. Surprising and unexpected results were obtained when comparing reference thieno[3,2-£]pyridine-6-carboxamide derivatives with the corresponding thieno[2,3-£]pvridine-5-carboxamide and 2-thia-4-aza-indene-6-carboxamide derivatives of the present invention. The thieno[2,3-fc]pvridine-5-carboxamide and 2-thia-4-aza-indene-6-carboxamide derivatives of the invention turned out clearly superior. In contrast to the compounds of the invention, e.g. 6,7-dmydto-N,7Hlimemyl^hydroxy-N-phenyl-6H&gt;xo-^ and4,5-^ihydro-N,4-dmiethyl-7-hydrc&gt;xy-N-phenyl-5K)xo-2-tiua^aza-mdene-fr carboxamide, the reference compound 4,5-dihydro-N,4-dimethyl-7-hydroxy-N-phenyl-5-oxo-thieno[3,2-fc]pvridine-6-carboxamide turned out inactive in the aEAE model Likewise, anN-phenyl group in exchange for an N-pyridyl group hi the carboxamide moiety resulted hi superior activity. Hence, the reference compound 6,7-dihydro-4-hydroxy-N-(3-pyridyl)-N,3,7-trimethyl-6-oxo-thieno[2J3-i]pyridine-5-carboxamide turned out poorly active hi comparison with the inventive compound 6,7-<lihydro>]pyridine-5-carboxamide. The prior art compound 6,7-dihydro-4-hydroxy-N-(3-pyridyl)-6-oxo-thieno[2,3-ii]pyridine-5-carboxamide, disclosed hi US 5,219,864, turned out inactive.<br>
All embodiments of the invention as disclosed hi the claims are herewith included hi the specification.<br>
The compounds of general formula (I) may be prepared by methods known hi the literature and by the following methods:<br>
(Figure Remove)The compounds of general formula (I) may be prepared by known methods and, for example, as shown above, by reaction of a carboxylic acid ester derivative (Q; RA = alkyl group of 1-4 carbons) with an aniline hi a suitable solvent, e.g. an aliphatic hydrocarbon such as heptane, octane and the like or an aromatic hydrocarbon such as toluene, xylene and the like. General methods for preparation of the carboxylic acid ester derivatives of formula (n) are described below starting from a 2-aminothiophene-3-carboxylate or a 4-aminomiophene-3-carboxylate. The aminothiophene-3-carboxylates are commercially available or known from literature (3, 4,5,6,7). N-alkylated anilines of formula (DDT) are commercially available or known from literature (8)wNew aminothiophene-3-carboxylates and N-alkylated anilines of formula (in) may be prepared by methods, which are generally analogous to those of said literature.<br>
MethodB:<br>
(Figure Remove)The compounds of formula 0) may also be prepared by reaction of a compound of formula (IV) with an aniline of formula (El). Various coupling reagents known in the art may be used,e.g., carbodiimides known from literature in US Pat. No. 4,547,511. One suitable coupling method utilizes thionyl chloride in the presence of triefhylamine and a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane. This method may be used in instances when direct coupling between ester and aniline does not work, e.g., when the aniline contains electron-withdrawing substituents. The cafboxylic acid derivatives of formula (IV) may be obtained from the corresponding esters of formula (II) by acidic cleavage as described below.<br>
The following examples are intended to illustrate the invention without restricting the scope thereof.<br>

To 6,7-d%dro-3,7-^imethyl^hydroxy-6^xo-Meno[2,3-fc]pyridine-5Kairboxylic acid (4.18 mmol, 1.0 g) in dichloromethane (10 ml), triethylamine (4 equiv., 16.7 ramol, 2.4 ml) andN-metbyl-2,5-difluotoatdline (1.2 equiv., 5.0 mmol, 720 mg) were added. To the mixture stirred under nitrogen and cooled to 0°C, a solution of thionyl chloride (1 .3 equiv., 5.4 mmol, 0.4 ml) in dichloromethane (5 ml) then was added during 30 min. The stirring was continued at 0°C for 1 h and then at room temperature for another 20 min. The reaction mixture was diluted with chloroform and quickly washed with cold 1M sulphuric acid. The organic phase then was immediately extracted with 0.5 M NaOH. Remaining traces of chlorinated organic solvents were removed using a rotary evaporator. The pH was adjusted to just above the point where the desired product starts to precipitate (approximately pH 6.5) and the solution was filtered through celite. The product was precipitated by acidification with 1 M HC1 until pH<br>
was approximately 1-2 and the mixture was allowed to stand for 2 hrs. The resulting precipitate was collected by filtration, washed with water, and dried under reduced pressure to give the title compound (1 .26 g, 83%).<br>

Pharmacological Methods<br>
Acute experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis faEAE). SJL/N female mice, 8 weeks of age, were used for the experiments. Mouse spinal cord homogenate (MSCH) was obtained from 8 to 12 weeks-old C57B1/6 female mice. The tissue was homogenised on ice and diluted in cold PBS. Incomplete Freund's containing 1 mg/ml M. tuberculosis hominis H37Ra was emulsified with an equal volume of MSCH to give a final concentration of 10 mgAnl of MSCH. The inoculum volume of 0.1 ml was injected intra-dermally at the base of the tail. Pertussis toxin was injected i.p. at day 0 and 3 after immunisation. Treatment was given per os daily at days 3 to 7 and 10 to 12. Control animals received saline. The animals, eight per dose group, were scored for clinical signs of paralytic disease on a scale from 0 to 5 in the following way: 0, normal; 1, limp tail; 2, hind limb paresis; 3 hind limb paralysis and limp foreleg; 4, bilateral hind and fore limb paralysis; S, death. Clinical scores were monitored at day 7 and daily from day 9 until the end of the experiment at day 14. Treatment effects were calculated as percent inhibition of clinical scores compared to saline treated controls.<br>
Collagen induced arthritis.<br>
DBA/1 male mice between 8 to 10 weeks of age were used for the experiments. On day 0 the mice were immunised intradermally at the base of the tail with bovine type n collagen (100 ug/mouse) in Freund's complete adjuvant The treatment was given per os daily on days 3 to 7,10 to 14,17 to 21,24 to 28 and 31 to 35. Fifteen days after immunisation mice were inspected for signs of arthritis. The animals were inspected three times a week. Every second or third day individual paws of the arthritic animals were scored by a scale from 0-4 (0=no<br><br>
arthritis, 1 = arthritis in one of the inteiphalangeal, metatarsophalangeal or intercarpal joints, 2 = two arthritic joints, 3 = three arthritic joints, 4 = as in 3 but with more severe redness and swelling of the paw). The score for each paw was added to give a maximal attainable score of 16 for each mouse.<br>
