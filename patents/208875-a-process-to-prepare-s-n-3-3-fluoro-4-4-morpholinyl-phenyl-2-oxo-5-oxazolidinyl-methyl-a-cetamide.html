(3)	separating the (S)-N-[[3-[3-fluoro-4-(4-morpholinyl)phenyl]-2-oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methyl]acetamide crystal "Form H" from the solvent(s).<br>
DETATT F.n DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Linezolid, (S)-N-[[3-[3-fluoro-4-(4-morpholinyl)phenyl]-2-oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methyl]acetamide, is a known pharmaceutically useful antibacterial agent, see US Patent 5,688,792 (EXAMPLE 5). Linezolid can be used orally or given by IV as a sterile solution.<br>
When linezolid was originally produced, the crystal form was Form I. Form II differs from Form I in its IR spectrum, X-ray powder diffraction spectrum and melting point.<br>
Once linezolid is synthesized, crystal Form II is prepared by starting with linezolid of high enantiomeric purity. It is preferred that the linezolid be more than 98% enantiomerically pure, it is more preferred that the linezolid be more than 99% pure and it is even more preferred that the linezolid be 99.5% pure. The linezolid of greater than 98% enantiomeric purity to be used to form crystal form II can either be in solution or be a solid. The linezolid starting material, solid or solution, is mixed with a solvent selected from the group consisting of:<br>
water,<br>
acetonitrile,<br>
chloroform, methylene chloride, toluene,<br>
R1-OH where R1 is C1-C6 alkyl,<br>
R1-CO-R2 where R2 is C1-C6 alkyl or phenyl substituted with 1 thru 3 R\ where R1 is as defined above, and where R1 is as defined above,<br><br>
R1-CO-O-R2 where R1 is C1-C6 alkyl and Rt is as defined above, R1-O-R2 where R1 is C1-C6 alkyl and R1 is as defined above. It is preferred that the solvent be selected from the group consisting of water, ethyl acetate, methanol, ethanol, propanol, /-propanol, butanol, acetonitrile, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, chloroform, methylene chloride, toluene, xylene, diethyl ether, or methyl-t-butyl ether. It is more preferred that the solvent be ethyl acetate, acetone, acetonitrile, propanol, or isopropanol. It is most preferred that the solvent be ethyl acetate.<br>
The mixture of linezolid in the solvent is agitated at a temperature below 80° until crystals of Form II are formed and crystals of other solid forms, such as Form I, disappear. It is preferred to dissolve the linezolid in ethyl acetate at a temperature near the boiling point of the solvent. This mixture is cooled to a temperature of about 70°. The mixture may be seeded with crystals of Form H to facilitate crystallization. It is preferred that the solid product is cooled and agitated at a temperature between about 45° and about 60° until the solids consist only of Form n crystals. It is most preferred to maintain the slurry at a temperature of about 55°. It is preferred to mix the linezolid and solvent for at least 10 min, it is even more preferred to mix the linezolid and solvent for at least 20 min and it is most preferred to mix the linezolid and solvent for at least 30 min. The time and temperature will vary depending on the solvent selected. With ethyl acetate it is preferred to mix for not less that 60 minutes.<br>
The crystalline slurry may be further cooled to improve yield, and the solid Form II product may be isolated. The mixture may be further cooled and agitated. Other measures which can be used to facilitate crystallization include, but are not limited to, cooling, concentration of the solution by evaporation or distillation, or through addition of other solvents.<br>
The crystals are isolated by procedures known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Crystal Form II is the most stable form below about 85°. It is preferred to use starting material with less than 0.2% of the R enantiomer of linezolid to minimize or eliminate the formation of a pseudoracemic solid solution of the two enantiomers which tends to crystallize as the Form I solid, even at temperatures below 85°.<br>
It is well known to those skilled in the art that linezolid is useful as an antibacterial agent, see for example US Patent 5,688,792.<br><br>
DEFINITIONS AND CONVENTIONS The definitions and explanations below are for the terms as used throughout this entire document including both the specification and the claims.<br>
DEFINITIONS Linezolid refers to (S)-N-[[3-[3-fluoro-4-(4-morpholinyl)phenyl]-2-oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methyl]acetamide the compound of formula:<br><br>
All temperatures are in degrees Centigrade.<br>
BR. refers to infrared spectroscopy.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable refers to those properties and/or substances which are acceptable to the patient from a pharmacological/toxicological point of view and to the manufacturing pharmaceutical chemist from a physical/chemical point of view regarding composition, formulation, stability, patient acceptance and bioavailability.<br>
When solvent pairs are used, the ratios of solvents used are volume/volume (v/v).<br>
When the solubility of a solid in a solvent is used the ratio of the solid to the solvent is weight/volume (wt/v).<br>
The term Cj-Ce alkyl means alkyl of 1 thru 6 carbon atoms and isomers thereof where such exist.<br>
EXAMPLES Without further elaboration, it is believed that one skilled in the art can, using the preceding description, practice the present invention to its fullest extent. The following detailed examples describe how to prepare the various compounds and/or perform the various processes of the invention and are to be construed as merely illustrative, and not limitations of the preceding disclosure in any way whatsoever. Those skilled in the art will promptly recognize appropriate variations from the procedures both as to reactants and as to reaction conditions and techniques.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 1	Preparation of Crytal Form II of Linezolid<br>
Linezolid with better than 99.8 % enantiomeric purity, less than 0.2% of the R enantiomer, (J .99 grams) is mixed with ethyJ acetate (] 00 mL).    The flask is stoppered and heated to 65° with constant stirring in a temperature controlled oil bath. The linezolid is completely dissolved and the mixture is stirred for an additional 10 minutes. The temperature is maintained at 55° in the flask and one neck of the flask is unstoppered to allow slow evaporation of the solvent. A gentle stream of nitrogen is blown across the open neck to aid in evaporation. Solids spontaneously precipitated from solution and the volume is reduced by about 25% of the initial volume. The flask is sealed and mixed for 90 minutes while maintaining the mixture at 55°. The mixture was then cooled to about 23° while being stirred. The solids are isolated by vacuum filtration using a sintered glass funnel to give linezolid in crystal form. Analysis by powder X-ray diffraction indicates that the solids are linezolid crystal Form H.<br><br>
