				<td>DESCRIPTION AMINO ALCOHOL DERIVATIVES, PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS<br>
CONTAINING THE SAME, AND USE THEREOF TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to novel amino alcohol derivatives,  which  exhibit  (33-adrenoceptor  stimulating activities, pharmaceutical compositions containing the same, and their uses. BACKGROUND ART<br>
Sympathetic |3-adrenoceptors have been classified into (51-, (32- and p3-subtypes. The p-adrenoceptors are each distributed in specific tissues and have different functions.<br>
Pl-adrenoceptors are located predominantly on heart, and stimulation of pl-adrenoceptors invokes increases in heart rate and potentiation of cadiac contractility. (32-adrenoceptors are found abundantly on smooth muscles of blood vessels, bronchi<br>
and uterus, and stimulation of |32-adrenoceptors leads to vasodilation, bronchodilation and inhibition of uterine contraction. A variety of pi- and (32-adrenoceptor stimulants have been developed so far and utilized as cardiotonics, bronchodilators, prophylactic agents for threatened, abortion or premature labor and the like.<br>
It has been reported that |33-adrenoceptors are located in adipocytes, brain, gallbladder, prostate, urinary bladder, intestinal tract and the like (see nonpatent literatures 1,2,<br>
3 and 4), and stimulation of (33 - adrenoceptors promotes lipolysis, increased thermogenesis, hypoglycemic activities;<br>
hypolipidemic  activities  such  as  triglyceride  lowering activities, hypocholesterolemic activities, HDL-cholesterol increasing activities and the like; antidepressive activities; gall bladder relaxing activities; suppression of intestinal motilities and the like (see nonpatent literatures 2,5,6 and 7). Accordingly, (33-adrenoceptor agonists are expected to be useful for treating or preventing obesity, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, depression, urinary dysfunctions, diseases caused by biliary tract hypermotility, or diseases caused by intestinal hypermotility.<br>
Recent studies on (33-adrenoceptor agonists have been focused mainly on developing an anti-obesity or anti-diabetic<br>
agent. However, many of such |33-adrenoceptor agonists have been accompanied with adverse reactions such as increased heart rate, muscle tremors, hypokalemia and the like, which are resulted from simulation of (31- and/or |32-adrenoceptor. It has also been reported that activities of |33-adrenoceptor agonist differ markedly among species, and some compounds exhibit less potent stimulating activities on human p3-adrenoceptors than on rodent such as rat (33-adrenoceptors (see nonpatent literature 8). Accordingly, it has been greatly desired for novel agents exhibiting potent stimulating activities on human |33-adrenoceptors with less adverse reactions caused by stimulation of (31- and |32-adrenoceptors.<br>
Donaldson K.H. et al disclose compounds represented by the following general formula:<br>

wherein Ra is a phenyl group optionally substituted with one or more substituents selected from the group consisting of halogen, hydroxyl, Ci_6 alkoxy, Ci-6 alkyl, nitro, cyano, hydroxymethyl, trif luoromethyl, -NRfRf and -NHSO2Rf in which Rf is hydrogen or Ci-4 alkyl; Rb is hydrogen or Ci_5 alkyl; Rc is cyano, tetrazol-5-yl or -CO2Rg in which R9 is hydrogen or d-6 alkyl; Rd and Re are independently hydrogen, Ci-6 alkyl, -CO2H, -CO2C1-6 alkyl, cyano, tetrazol-5-yl, halogen, trifluoromethyl or Ci-e alkoxy (see patent literature 1) .

Effect on circulatory organ<br>
(31- and (32-adrenergic actions of compounds of the present invention were investigated by assuming the changes of heart rate and blood pressure as an index. Polyethylene catheter filled with heparinized saline was inserted into carotid artery of urethane anesthetized SD rat (SLC) . Another end of catheter was connected to a pressure transducer and the blood pressure was measured through an amplifier. And the heart rate was determined by tachometer connected to this amplifier. Compounds of the present invention were dissolved in an appropriate solvent and were intravenously administered to SD rats at the dosages from 10 ug/kg as lowest dose to I mg/kg as highest dose. After a certain period of time after each dosage of test compound was administered, blood pressure and heart rate were measured and compared with that before compound administration. Those changes were extremely slight. The compounds of the present invention were dissolved in an appropriate solvent and were intravenously administered to pentobarbital anesthetized cynomolgus monkeys at the dosages from 1 ng/kg as lowest dose to 1 mg/kg as highest dose. After a certain period of time after each dosage of test compound was administered, blood pressure and heart rate were measured and compared with that before compound administration. In each dosage, the changes of blood pressure and heart rate were extremely slight as in the case of rats.<br>
As a result of these experiments, it was suggested that effect of compounds of the present invention on cardiac organ was extremely slight and that there was less possibility of<br><br>
adverse effect expression resulted from (31- and (32-adrenergic activation.<br>
