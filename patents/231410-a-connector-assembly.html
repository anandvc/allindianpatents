				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>A CONNECTOR ASSEMBLY<br>
The present invention relates to an end connector for a strand of jewelry and, in particular, to<br>
an invisible connector for a beaded strand of jewelry strung on a common strand.<br>
Beaded jewelry strands, such as a string of pearls, are commonly made by stringing through-<br>
bored beads on a common string or strand. The string may comprise any suitable material possessing<br>
the necessary strength and flexibility, a single mono-filament strand of suitable plastic material often<br>
being used. Semi-precious or precious metal connectors or clasps are typically used to connect the<br>
strand ends for secure, but reopenable attachment. Such connectors or clasps function in many<br>
different ways, but one common characteristic is that they all define a noticeable gap between the<br>
end-connected beads in the strand.<br>
Invisible strand connectors have been developed that are not readily apparent when the end<br>
beads of the strand are connected and give the appearance of all beads in the strand being joined<br>
without a visible connector or clasp. However, such invisible connectors are of delicate construction<br>
and, if broken, are difficult and tedious to repair. One prior art type of invisible connector is shown in<br>
Fig. 6 and includes mating through-bored posts mounted in bores drilled in the two end beads (e.g.,<br>
pearls) of a strand. One of the posts 2 is of a smaller diameter and has an extended threaded stud on<br>
one end. The other of the posts 3 of larger diameter has a tapped I.D. to receive the threaded stud to<br>
interconnect the end beads and thus provide a strand with an apparent invisible connection. Each of<br>
the posts is through-bored and has inserted into it one end of connecting string or wire piece 4 that is<br>
threaded through a small hole in the opposite end of the post. The ends of the string pieces within the<br>
bores are enlarged as by knotting or heading to prevent passage through the small hole. The free ends<br>
of the wire pieces are then tied or otherwise secured to the ends of the main strand on which the<br>
remaining beads are strung. The most serious problem with this prior art construction is that the posts<br>
themselves are very small in diameter (e.g.. about 0.08 inch (2mm) or less) and, after being through-<br>
bored for the connecting wires, are extremely weak and susceptible to breaking. Also, removing and<br>
replacing the end of the string piece is difficult.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the present invention, an invisible connector for a string of<br>
beaded jewelry utilizes a threaded post construction that is far stronger than prior art<br>
constructions, yet is easier to repair if broken.<br>
The connector assembly of the present invention is attached to and interconnects<br>
the two end beads of a beaded stranded or the like. A first connector post is secured in a<br>
through-bore in one of the end beads, the post having a solid body, one end of which has an<br>
integral threaded stud that extends outwardly from the bead. A second connector post is<br>
secured in a through-bore in the other of the end beads and has an end tapped to receive the<br>
threaded stud of the first post. Each of the connector posts is provided on its respective<br>
opposite end with an eye that is captured in the post end to swivel on the post axis and to extend<br>
outwardly therefrom for connection to one end of the string on which the remaining beads are<br>
strung. To provide mounting for the eyes, the opposite unthreaded end of each connector post<br>
is provided with a bored ID portion and an end cap that encloses the bore and is provided with a<br>
small axial hole extending therethrough. Each eye includes a neck that extends through the<br>
hole in the end cap and an anchoring base connected to the opposite end of the neck and<br>
captured in the ID bore for swiveling movement therein.<br>
The second connector post has a length substantially equal to the diameter of the<br>
bead and is secured therein along its full axial length. Preferably, the body of the second<br>
connector beyond the tapped end is substantially solid. However, the body of the second<br>
connector may alternately be through -bore.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Fig. 1 shows a portion of a beaded strand of jewelry utilizing the invisible<br>
connector of the present invention.<br>
Fig. 2 is an enlarged view, partly in section, showing the two end beads of the<br>
strand which mount the components of the connector assembly of the present invention.<br>
Figs. 3-5 show the sequence of steps used to manufacture and attach the swivel<br>
eyes used with the connector assembly.<br>
Fig. 6 is a sectional detail through an invisible connector assembly of the prior<br>
art.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
In Fig. 1, a strand 10 of beaded jewelry includes aplurality of beads 11, each<br>
having a small diametral bore formed therein through which a common flexible string 12 is<br>
inserted to form a string or strand of beads. The opposite ends of the strand 10 are defined by<br>
first and second end beads 13,14 which together carry the invisible connector assembly 15 of<br>
the present invention.<br>
One of the end beads, such as first end bead 13, is provided with a through-bore<br>
16 along its diameter which has a small size, for example 2 mm, but which is typically larger<br>
than the bores in the other beads of the strand mounted on the string 12. The through-bore 16 in<br>
bead 13 has a solid metal first post 17 inserted therein. The post 17 is preferably made of a<br>
precious metal, such as silver or gold alloy. The post has an OD that matches the ID of the<br>
through-bore 16 to fit snuggly therein and maty be secured in place with a suitable cement or<br>
adhesive. One end of the first post 17 is provided with an integral threaded stud 18 that extends<br>
axially outwardly beyond the bead 13.<br>
The second end bead 14 is similarly provided with a through-bore 20 within<br>
which is secured a second metal post 21. The second post is preferably solid, except for a<br>
tapped end 22 adapted to match and receive the threaded stud 18 extending from the first end<br>
bead 13. When the threaded stud 18 of the first end bead is threaded into the capped end 22 in<br>
the post within the second end bead 14, the two beads may be brought into nearly abutting<br>
contact, as shown in Fig. 1.<br>
To prevent undesirable twisting of the strand 10 as the threaded connector is<br>
joined, the opposite ends of the connector posts 17,21 are provided with swiveling eyes 23. The<br>
eyes 23 provide connection for the ends of the string 12 on which the remaining beads are<br>
strung.<br>
Referring to Figs. 3 - 5, each of the eyes 23 is formed and attached to its<br>
respective post 17 or 21 in the same manner. A stem piece 24 is formed with enlarged and<br>
preferably cylindrical base 25 and a wire-like neck 26. A small annular end cap 27, having a<br>
diameter equal to the diameter of the post 17 or 21, is provided with a center hole 23 slightly<br>
larger than the diameter of the neck 26 so that neck may pass easily there through. After the<br>
neck has been inserted through the hole 28 in. the end cap 27, the end of the neck is formed into<br>
an eye 23 having a center connecting hole for the string 12 front area.<br>
The end of each post 17,21, opposite the threaded connections, is provided with<br>
a shallow counterbore 30 having a diameter slightly larger than the diameter of the stem piece<br>
base 25 and an axial depth sufficient to receive the base therein. The end cap 27 is then placed<br>
against and soldered to the end of he post defining the perimeter of the counterbore 30. The<br>
stem piece is thus captured for swiveling movement on the axis of the post.<br>
To disconnect the beaded strand 10, the end beads 13,14 carrying the connector<br>
assembly 15 are easily located by the connecting eyes 23 on their opposite ends. The beads<br>
13,14 may be unscrewed and disconnected without twisting by virtue of relative rotation of the<br>
eyes therein. The solid construction of he posts 17,21, which are formed without the through-<br>
bores of the prior art, enhance considerably the strength of the connection. Also, the tedious,<br>
time-consuming and delicate through-boring of the posts is eliminated.<br>
