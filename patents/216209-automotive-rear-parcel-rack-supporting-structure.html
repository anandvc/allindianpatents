				<td>The present Invention relates to an automotive rear parcel rack supporting structure. More particularly, it relates to a structure of a rear parcel rack holder itself for supporting a rear parcel rack, and an automotive rear parcel rack supporting structure in which the arrangement position of a rear parcel rack holder on an automobile is most favorable.<br><br>
A rear parcel rack is sometimes disposed at the rear portion of an automotive cabin to put parcels or install car stereo speakers depending on the type of vehicle. Conventionally, structures of a rear parcel rack holder itself for supporting the rear parcel rack and technologies concerning a rear parcel rack supporting structure considering the arrangement position of the rear parcel rack holder on an automobile have been disposed in large numbers. For example, Japanese Patent Provisional Publication No. 5-238323 (No. 238323/1993) fuid Japanese Patent Provisional Publication No. 8-132970 (No. 132970/1996) are taken as the examples. In any of these technologies, an inner trim is first installed to a vehicle body, and then a rear parcel rack holder is installed to the vehicle body or the inner trim from the upside of the inner trim covering the vehicle body to support a rear parcel rack. Specifically, a<br><br>
technology has been disclosed In which the rear parcel rack holder is installed on the cabin side of inner trim, and the rear parcel rack is supported by the rear parcel rack holder only or by both of the rear parcel rack holder and the inner trim.<br>
In the aforementioned related arts, the rear parcel rack holder for supporting the rear parcel rack is installed from the upside of the inner trim. For such a structure, when heavy objects such as parcels and car stereo speakers are put on the rear parcel rack, these loads are transmitted to the inner trim via the rear parcel rack holder. Therefore, the inner trim is required to have strength and rigidity enough to support the load to prevent deflection, etc., so that it is necessary to dispose reinforcement ribs on the inner trim or to increase the thickness of the inner trim. As a result, the inner trim has been regarded as a part whose weight is difficult to decrease in designing.<br>
Also, since the rear parcel rack holder is attached to the inner trim on the cabin side, the holder must be located at a position where the design of inner trim is not degraded, and the selection of the arrangement position of holder is restricted from the viewpoint of appearance.<br>
Also, conventionally, when the rear parcel rack holder is installed to the vehicle body via the inner trim with screw or the like, a nut is welded to the vehicle side, or installation work is performed while the operator holds a nut by hand from the vehicle side. Therefore, an  extra work process of welding the nut to the<br><br>
vehicle body in advance is needed, or work efficiency of the installation of the rear parcel rack holder is poor.<br>
Further, since the rear parcel rack holder is installed on the cabin side of the inner trim, the design shape of inner trim surface on the cabin side is often discontinuous, which causes degradation in appearance in the cabin. OBJECT AND SUMMARY QF THE IMVEHTION<br>
To solve the above problems, the automotive rear parcel rack supporting structure in accordance with the present invention supports a rear parcel rack disposed at the rear portion of an automotive cabin by using a rear parcel rack holder comprising a body, an attachment portion for attaching the body to the vehicle, an attachment portion for an inner trim, and a support portion for the rear parcel rack. The rear parcel rack holder is disposed between the inner trim and a vehicle body, and is fixed to the vehicle body by the attachment portion for attaching the body to the vehicle.<br>
The aforesaid rear parcel rack means a plate-shaped automotive part for partitioning the space at the rear portion of the automotive cabin. This rear parcel rack means an automotive part which not only serves as a mere psirtition but also has a function such that parcels can be put or car stereo speakers or the like can be installed.<br>
Also, the automotive rear parcel rack supporting structure in accordance with the present invention is configured so that the rear pfiircel rack holder is disposed on the rear side or the transverse<br><br>
side of the vehicle to support the rear parcel rack.<br>
Also, the automotive rear parcel rack supporting structure in accordance with the present invention is configured so that the centerline of the body with respect to the width in the lengthwise direction of the rear parcel rack holder passes through the center of the attachment portion for attaching the body to the vehicle, and a resin nut is provided at the attachment portion for attaching the body to the vehicle.<br>
Further, the automotive rear parcel rack supporting structure in accordance with the present invention is configured so that the attachment portion for attaching the rear parcel rack holder to the inner trim is shifted to the side of the cabin with respect to the attachment portion for attaching the body of the rear parcel rack holder to the vehicle so as to approach the side of the inner trim.<br>
According to the present invention, the rear parcel rack holder for supporting the rear parcel rack is attached to the vehicle body. In a structure in which the rear parcel rack holder is installed from the upside of the inner trim rack as in the case of the related art, when heavy objects such as parcels and car stereo speakers are put on the rear parcel rack, these loads are supported by the inner trim via the rear parcel rack holder. Therefore, the inner trim is required to have strength and rigidity enough to support the load to prevent deflection, etc., so that it is necessary to dispose reinforcement ribs on the inner trim or to increase the thickness of the inner trim. According to the present invention, however.<br><br>
the structure is such that the vehicle body supports the load, so that the load carried by the inner trim can be decreased as compared with the related art. Therefore, the number of reinforcement ribs of the inner trim can be reduced or the thickness of the inner trim can be decreased, which enables the decrease in weight.<br>
The present invention provides a structure in which the rear parcel rack holder is attached to the vehicle body, not to the inner trim unlike the related art. Therefore, the arrangement position of the rear parcel rack holder can be selected freely without degrading the design of the inner trim.<br>
Also, according to the present invention, the resin nut is provided on the rear parcel rack holder. Therefore, when the rear parcel rack holder is installed to the vehicle body with a screw or the like, it can be installed to the vehicle body without the advance welding of the nut to the vehicle body side or the holding of the nut by operator"s hand from the vehicle body side. Consequently, the installation work of the rear parcel rack holder can be Improved, by which the productivity can be enhanced and the cost can be reduced.<br>
Further, according to the present invention, the attachment portion for attaching the rear parcel rack holder to the inner trim is disposed so as to approach the inner trim side. Conventionally, since the rear parcel rack holder is attached to the inner trim on the cabin side, the surface shape of the inner trim on the cabin side is often discontinuous. However, according to the present<br><br>
Invention, since the rear parcel rack holder Is disposed between the inner trim and the vehicle body, the surface shape of the inner trim can be designed continuously, so that the appearance in the cabin can be improved.<br>
In addition, according to the present invention, the shape of the rear parcel rack holder is symmetrical with respect to the centerline of the rear parcel rack holder with respect to the width in the lengthwise direction. Therefore, the rear parcel rack holder can be used in common for both of the right and left sides of the vehicle, so that the part can be made common.<br>
