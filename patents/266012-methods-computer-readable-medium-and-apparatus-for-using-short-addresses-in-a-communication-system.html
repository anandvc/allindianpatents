METHODS AND APPARATUS FOR USING SHORT ADDRESSES IN A COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
IlELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]    The present application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application S.N. 60/812,011 filed on June 7, 2006, titled "A METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR L2TP TUNNELING" and the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application S.N. 60/812,012 filed on June 7,2006 titled "A METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR ADDRESSING MULTIPLE ACCESS POINTS" each of which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002]     1 lie present invention is directed to methods and apparatus for communications, and more particularly to methods and apparatus related to routing of packets.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003]     W ireless communications systems often include a plurality of access points (APs) and/or other network elements in addition to access terminals, e.g., mobile or other end node devices. In many cases access terminals nomially communicate with access points viii wireless communications links while other elements in the network, e.g., APs, generiiUy communicate via non-air links, e.g., fiber, cable or wire links. In the case of an aiiiink, bandwidth is a valuable constrained resource. Accordingly, it is desirable that communication over the airlink be performed in an efficient manner without excessive overhead.<br>
[0004]     Communications links between access points and/or other network devices are often less constrained from a bandwidth perspective than are air links between access terminals and access points. Accordingly, more overhead in terms of address length and/or other information may be acceptable over backliaul links than over an airlink.<br>
[0005]     While IP (Internet Protocol) addresses have been used successfully in networks for many years, they tend to include a fair number of bits. For<br><br>
communications over airlinks, it would be desirable if shorter addresses could be used over the airlink. However, it would be desirable that any changes to addresses used over the airlink not preclude the use of IP addresses over other links, e.g., backhaul links.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0006]     Methods and apparatus for communicating between an access terminal (AT) and remote device via an access point (AP) are described. For communications over the air link, between an AP and an AT a short address corresponding to the remote device is used for routing packets to/from the remote device. This conserves air link resources. However, for communicating between the AP and the remote device a longer address, e.g., a fi.ill IP address corresponding to the remote device is used. The AT converts between the long and short addresses as information, e.g., packets are communicated between the remote device and the AT. The long address may be, for example, an IP address corresponding to the remote device used to route packets through a Layer 2 tunnel between the remote device and the AP. In some embodiments the remote device is a remote access point. The short address corresponding to the remote device is, in some embodiments, a shortened version of the full IP address corresponding to the remote device. However, the short address need not be a shortened version of the IP address used in the Layer 2 tunnel and may be any address assigned to correspond to the long, e.g., foil length, IP address of the remote device but having fewer bits than the long address. In some embodiments, the AT which is communicating with the remote device is responsible for indicating to the AP the short address to be used over the airlink for a given long address. This may be done by the AT sending a signal, e.g., message, indicating that a particular long address maps to a particular short address supplied by the AT. In order to implement the mapping between long and short addresses, the AP stores the mapping information. When receiving a packet, e.g., a tunneled packet, including the long address corresponding to the remote device, the AP determines the corresponding short address from the look up table. The AP then transmits the packet payload to the AT using the short address of the remote device instead of the long address of the remote device. In this manner, the packet payload \H communicated to the AT with the sender being identified using the<br><br>
short address as opposed to the full long address. The AT knows the mapping between the long and short addresses and is able to identify the original source of the packet payload. With ri^gard to packets being directed to the remote device, the AT sends the packet payload with the short address of the remote device to the AP. The AP then looks up the short address, replaces it with the long, e.g., full IP address and then forwards the packet payload to the remote device using the long address of the remote device to indicate the destination of the packet being sent. In this manner, the AT can communicate over the airlink using fewer bits to identify the remote device as the intended destination of the packet contents than would be required if the long address was used over the airlink between the AT and AP.<br>
[0007]    A n exemplary method of operating an access po Int to communicate information to an access terminal, in accordance with some embodiments, comprises: receiving a packet from a remote device, said packet including a long address and information to be communicated; determining a short address corresponding to said long address to be used for communications over a communications link, said short address including fewer bits than said long address; and transmitting said information to be communicated with the short address to said access terminal.

An exemplary access point for communicating information to an access terminal, comprises: a network interface for receiving a packet from a remote device via a network cormection, said packet including a long address and information to be communicated; a long address to short address mapping module for determining a short address corresponding to said long address, said short address for use over a wireless communications link, said short address including fewer bits than said long address; a downlink packet generation module for generating a packet including said short address and said information to be communicated; and a wireless transmitter for transmitting, over said wireless communications link, downlink packets.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0020]     W ireless communication systems are widely deployed to provide various types of commvuiication content such as voice, data, and so on. These systems may be multiple-access nystems capable of supporting communication \vith multiple users by sharing the availnble system resources (e.g., bandwidth and transmit power). Examples of such multiple-access systems include World Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX), infrared protocols such as Infrared Data Association (IrDA), short-range wireless protocols/technologies, Bluetooth® technology, ZigBee® protocol, ultra wide band (UWB) protocol, home radio frequency (HomeRF), shared wireless access protocol (SWAP), wideband technology such as a wireless Ethernet compatibility alliance (WECA), wireless fidelity alliance (Wi-Fi Alliance), 802.11 network<br><br>
technology, public switched telephone network technology, public heterogeneous communications network technology such as the Internet, private wireless communications network, land mobile radio network, code division multiple access (CDMA), wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA), universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS), advanced mobile phone service (AMPS), time division multiple access (TDMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA), global system for mobile communications (GSM), single carrier (IX) radio transmission technology (RTT), evolution data only (EV-DO) technology, general packet radio service (GPRS), enhanced data GSM environment (EDGE), high speed downlinlc data packet access (HSPDA), analog and digital satellite systems, and any other technologies/protocols that may be used in at least one of a wireless communications network and a data communications network.<br>
[0021]     Generally, a wireless multiple-access communication system can simultaneously support communication for multiple wireless terminals. Each terminal communicates with one or more base stations via transmissions on the forward and reverse links. The forward link (or downlink) refers to the communication link from the base stations to the terminals, and the reverse link (or uplink) refers to the communication link from the terminals to the base stations. This communication link may be established via a single-in-single-out, multiple-in-signal-out or a multiple-in-multiple-out (MIMO) system.<br>
[0022]     Referring to Fig. 1, a multiple access wireless communication system according to one embodiment is illustrated. An access point 100 (AP) includes multiple antenna groups, one including 104 and 106, another including 108 and 110, and an additional including 112 and 114. In Fig. 1, only two antennas are shown for each antenna group, however, more or fewer antennas may be utilized for each antenna group. Access terminal 116 (AT) is in communication with antermas 112 and 114, where antennas 112 and 114 transmit information to access temiinal 116 over forward link 120 and receive information from access terminal 116 over reverse link 118. Access terminal 122 is in communication with antennas 106 and 108, where antennas 106 and 108 transmit information to access terminal 122 over forward link 126 and receive information from access terminal 122 over reverse link 124. In a FDD system.<br><br>
communication links 118, 120, 124 and 126 may use different frequencies for communication. I'or example, forward link 120 may use a different frequency then that used by reverse link 118.<br>
[0023]     Eiich group of antennas and/or the area in which they are designed to communicate is often referred to as a sector of the access point. In the embodiment, antenna groups each are designed to communicate to access terminals in a sector of the areas covered by access point 100.<br>
[0024]     In communication over forward links 120 and 126, the transmitting antennas of access point 100 utilize beamforming in order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of forward links for the different access terminals 116 and 122. Also, an access point using beamforming to transmit to access terminals scattered randomly through its coverage causes less interference to access terminals in neighboring cells than an access point transmitting through a single antenna to all its access terminals.<br>
[0025]     Ail access point may be a fixed station used for communicating with the terminals and may also be referred to as an access node, a Node B, a base station or some other terminology. An access terminal may also be called an access device, user equipment (UE), a wireless communication device, terminal, wireless terminal, mobile terminal, mobile node, end node or some other terminology.<br>
[0026]    FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an embodiment of an exemplary access point 210 and an exemplary access terminal 250 in a MIMO system 200. At the access point 210, traffic data for a number of data streams is provided from a data source 212 to a transmit (TX) data processor 214.<br>
[0027]     In an embodiment, each data stream is transmitted over a respective transmit antenna. TX data processor 214 formats, codes, and interleaves the traffic data for each data stream based on a particular coding scheme selected for that data stream to provide coded data.<br>
[0028]    The coded data for each data stream may be multiplexed with pilot data using OFDM tediniques. The pilot data is typically a known data pattern that is processed in a known manner and may be used at the receiver system to estimate the channel response. The multiplexed pilot and coded data for each data stream is then<br><br>
modulated (i.e., symbol mapped) based on a particular modulation scheme (e.g., BPSK, QSPK, M-PSK, or M-QAM) selected for that data stream to provide modulation symbols. The data rate, coding, and modulation for each data stream may be determined by instructions performed by processor 230.<br>
[0029]     I he modulation symbols for each of the data streams are then provided to a TX MIMO processor 220, which may fiirther process the modulation symbols (e.g., for OFDM). TX MIMO processor 220 then provides NT modulation symbol streams to NT transmitters (' PMTR) 222a through 222t. In certain embodiments, TX MIMO processor 220 ajiplies beamforming weights to the symbols of the data streams and to the antenna from which the symbol is being transmitted.<br>
[0030]    Bach transmitter (222a,..., 222t) receives and processes a respective<br>
symbol stream tti provide one or more analog signals, and further conditions (e.g.,<br>
amplifies, filters, and upconverts) the analog signals to provide a modulated signal<br>
suitable for trannmission over the MIMO chaimel Nr modulated signals from<br>
transmitters 222ii through 222t are then transmitted from NT antennas 224a through<br>
224t, respectively.	:<br>
[0031]     At access terminal 250, the transmitted modulated signals are received by NR antennas 252a through 252r and the received signal from ea(,;h antenna 252 is provided to a rcHpective receiver (RCVR) 254a through 254r. Hach receiver (254a,..., 254r) conditions (e.g., filters, amplifies, and downconverts) a respective received signal, digitizes the conditioned signal to provide samples, and further processes the samples to provide a corresponding "received" symbol stream.<br>
[0032]     An RX data processor 260 then receives and processes the NR received symbol streams Irom NR receivers (254a,..., 254r) based on a particular receiver processing technique to provide NT "detected" symbol streams. The RX data processor 260 then demodulates, deinterleaves, and decodes each detected symbol stream to recover the traffic data for the data stream. The processing by RX data processor 260 is complementary to that performed by TX MIMO processor 220 and TX data processor 214 at transmitter system 210.<br><br>
[0033]    A processor 270 periodically determines which pre-coding matrix to use (discussed below). Processor 270 formulates a reverse link message comprising a matrix index portion and a rank value portion.<br>
[0034]     The reverse link message may comprise various types of information regarding the communication link and/or the received data stream. The reverse link message is then processed by a TX data processor 238, which also receives traffic data for a number of data streams from a data source 236, modulated by a modulator 280, conditioned by transmitters 254a through 254r, and transmitted, via antennas (252a, 252r), respectively, back to access point 210.<br>
[0035]     At access point 210, the modulated signals from access terminal 250 are received by anteimas 224, conditioned by receivers 222, demodulated by a demodulator 240, and processed by a RX data processor 242 to extract the reverse link message transmitted by the receiver system 250. Processor 230 then determines which pre-coding matrix to use for determining the beamforming weights, then processes the extracted message.<br>
[0036] Memory 232 includes routines and data/information. Processors 230, 220 and/or 242 oxecute the routines and uses the data/information in memory 232 to control the operiition of the access point 210 and implement methods. Memory 272 includes routineH and data/information. Processors 270,260, and/or 238 execute the routines and USCK the data/information in memory 272 to control the operation of the access terminal 250 and implement methods.<br>
[0037]    III an aspect, SimpleRAN is designed to significantly simphfy the communicationH protocols between the backhaul access network elements in a wireless radio access network, while providing fast handoff to accommodate the demands of low latency applications, such as VOIP, in fast changing radio conditions.<br>
[0038]     111 an aspect, the network comprises access terminals (AT) and an access<br>
network (AN).<br>
[0039]     The AN supports both a centralized and distributed deployment. The network architectures for the centralized and distributed deployments are shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 respectively.<br><br>
[0040]    Figure 3 illustrates an exemplary network 300 including a distributed AN 302 and an AT 303.<br>
Distributed Network Architecture<br>
[0041]     In the distributed architecture shown in Fig. 3, the AN 302 comprises access points (AP) and home agents (HA). AN 302 includes a plurality of access points (APa 304, APb 306, APc 308) and home agent 310. In addition, AN 302 includes an IP cloud 312. The APs (304, 306, 308) are coupled to the IP cloud via links (314, 316, 318), respectively. The IP cloud 312 is coupled to the HA 310 via link 320.<br>
An AP includes a:<br>
Network function (NF):<br>
o   One per AP, and multiple NFs can serve a single AT.<br>
o A single NF is the IP layer attachment point (lAP) for each AT, i.e., the NF to wliich the HA forwards packets sent to the AT. In the example of Figure 4, NF 336 is the current lAP for AT 303, as shown by the line 322 in Fig. 4.<br>
o   The lAP may change (L3 handoff) to optimize routing of packets over the backhaul to the AT.<br>
o   The lAP also performs the function of the session master for the AT. (In some embodiments, only the session master can perform session configuration, or change the session state.)<br>
o   The NF acts as the controller for each oftheTFs in the AP and performs functions like allocating, managing and tearing down resources for an AT at the TF.<br>
Transceiver functions (TF) or sector:<br>
o   Multiple per AP, and multiple TFs can serve a single AT.<br>
o   Provides the air interface attachment for the AT.<br>
o   Can be different for the forward and reverse links.<br>
o   Changes (L2 handoff) based on radio conditions.<br><br>
[0042]    I] I AN 302 APa 304 includes NF 324, TF 326 mid TF 328. In AN 302 APb 306 include*^ NF 330, TF 332 and TF 334. In AN 302 APc 308 includes NF 336, TF 338 and TF .'140.<br>
An AT includes a:<br>
InterCiice I__x presented to the mobile node (MN) for each NF in the active<br>
set.<br>
Mobile node (MN) to support IP layer mobility at tlie access terminal.<br>
APs communicate using a tunneling protocol defined over IP. The tunnel is an IP-in-IP tunnel for the data plane and an L2TP tunnel for the control plane.<br>
[0043]     Exemplary AT 303 includes a plurality of Interfaces (I_a 342,1_b 344, I_c 346) and MN 348. AT 303 can be, and sometimes is, coupled to AP_a 304 via wireless link 350. AT 303 can be, and sometimes is, coupled to AP_b 306 via wireless link 352. AT 303, can be, and sometimes is, coupled to AP_c 308 via wireless link 354.<br>
[0044]     Figure 4 illustrates an exemplary network 400 including a distributed AN 402 and an AT 403.<br>
Centralized Network Architecture<br>
[0045]     In a centralized architecture shown in Fig. 4, the NF is no longer logically associated with a single TF, so the AN comprises network functions, access points and home agents. Exemplary AN 402 includes a plurality of NFs (404, 406, 408), a plurality of APs (AP_a 410, AP_b 412, AP_c 414), HA 416 and IP cloud 418. NF 404 is coupled to IP cloud 418 via link 420. NF 406 is coupled to IP cloud 418 via link 422. NF 408 is coupled to IP cloud 418 via link 424. IP cloud 418 is coupled to HA 416 via link 426. NF 404 is coupled to (AP_a 410, AP_b 412, AP_c 414) via links (428,430,432), respectively. NF 406 is coupled to (AP_a 410, AP_b 412, AP_c 414) via links (434, 436, 438), respectively. NF 408 is coupled to (AP_a 410, AP_b 412, AP_c 414) via links (440,442,444), respectively.<br>
[0046]     AP_a 410 includes TF 462 and TF 464. AP_b 412 includes TF 466 and TF 468. AP_c 414 includes TF 470 and TF 472.<br><br>
[0047]     Since an NF acts as the controller for a TF, and many NFs can be logically associated with a single TF, the NF controller for an AT, i.e., the NF communicating with an AT as a part of the active set, performs the functions of allocating, managing and tearing down resources for the TF at that AT. Therefore, multiple NFs may control resources at a single TF, although these resources are managed independently. In the example of Figure 4, NF 408 is acting as an lAP for AT 403, as shown by the line 460.<br>
[0048]     The rest of the logical functions performed are the same as for the distributed architecture.<br>
[0049]     Exemplary AT 403 includes a plurality of Interfaces (I_a 446,1_b 448, I__c 450) and MN 452. AT 403 can be, and sometimes is, coupled to AP_a 410 via wireless link 45^1, AT 403 can be, and sometimes is, coupled to AP_b 412 via wireless link 456. AT 40J can be, and sometimes is, coupled to AP_c 414 via wireless link 458.<br>
Access and active set management<br>
[0050]     111 systems like DO and 802.20, an AT obtains service from an AP by making an accesN attempt on an access chaimel of a particular sector (TF). The NF associated with 1 he TF receiving the access attempt contacts the lAP that is the session master for the AT and retrieves a copy of the AT's session. (The AT indicates the identity of the lAP by including an UATI in the access payload, The UATI may be used as an IP address l,o directly address the lAP, or may be used to look up the address of the lAP.) On a successful access attempt, the AT is assigned air interface resources such as a MAC ID (Media Access Control Identifier) and data channels to communicate with that sector.<br>
[0051]     Additionally, the AT may send a report indicating the other sectors it can hear and their signal strengths. The TF receives the report and forwards it to a network based controller in the NF which in turn provides the AT with an active set. For DO and 802.20 as they are implemented today, there is exactly one NF that the AT can communicate with (except during an NF handoff when there are temporarily two). Each of the TFs in communication with the AT will forward the received data and signaling to this single NF'. This NF also acts as a network-based controller for the AT and is<br><br>
responsible for negotiating and managing the allocation and tear down of resources for the AT to use with the sectors in the active set.<br>
[0052]    The active set is therefore the set of sectors in which the AT is assigned air interface resources. The AT will continue to send periodic reports and the network based controller may add or remove sectors from the active set as the AT moves around in the network.<br>
[0053]    NTs in the active set will also fetch a local copy of the session for the AT when they join the active set. The session is needed to communicate properly with the AT.<br>
[0054]    For a CDMA air link with soft handoff, on the uplink each of the sectors in the active set may try to decode an AT's transmission. On the downlink, each of the sectors in the active set may transmit to the AT simultaneously, and the AT combines the received transmissions to decode the packet.<br>
[0055]    For an OFDMA system, or a system without soft handoff, a function of the active set is lo allow the AT to switch quickly between sectors in the active set and maintain service without having to make a new access attempt. An access attempt is generally much Blower than a switch between members of the active set, since the active set member alreiidy has the session and the air interface resources assigned to the AT. Therefore, an active set is useful to do handoff without affecting the QoS service of active applications.<br>
[0056]     When, an AT and the session master in the lAP tiegotiate attributes, or alternatively the state of the cormection changes, the new values for the attributes or the new state need ti t be distributed to each of the sectors in the active set in a timely manner to ensure optimal service from each sector. In some cases, for example if the type of headers changes, or security keys change, an AT may not be able to communicate at all with a sector until these changes are propagated to that sector. Thus every member ofthe active set should be updated when the session changes. Some changes may be less critical to synchronize than others.<br>
State and handoff<br><br>
[0057]     There are three main types of state or context found in the network for an AT that has an active connection:<br>
[0058]    Data state is the state in the network on the data path between the AT and the lAP or an NF during a connection. Data state includes things such as header compressor state or RLP flow states which are very dynamic and difficuh to transfer.<br>
[0059]    Session state is the state in the network on the control path between the AT and the lAP that is preserved when a connection is closed. Session state includes the value of the attributes that are negotiated between the AT and the lAP. These attributes affect the characteristics of the connection and the service received by the AT. For example, an AT may negotiate the QoS configuration for a new application and supply new filter and flow specifications to the network indicating the QoS service requirements for the application. As another example the AT may negotiate the size and type of the headers used in communication with the AN. The negotiation of a new set of attributes is defined as a session change.<br>
[0060]     Connection state is the state in the network on the control path between the AT and the 1AP or an NF that is not preserved when a connection closes and the AT is idle. Connection state may include such information as power control loop values, soft handoff timing, and active set information.<br>
[0061]    III an TAP or L3 handoff the three types of state may need to be transferred between the old lAP and the new lAP. If only an idle AT can make an L3 handoff, then only the session state needs to be transferred. To support L3 handoff for an active AT, the data and connection state may also need to be transferred.<br>
[0062]     Systems like DO and 802.20, make L3 handoff of the data state simple by defining multiple routes (or data stacks), where the data state for each route is local to that route, i.e., the routes each have independent data state. By associating each lAP with a different route, the data state does not need to be transfetred in a handoff. A further, even belter step, is to associate each NF with a different route in which case L3 handoff is completely transparent to the data state, except for possible packet reordering.<br><br>
[0063]     Since the data state has multiple routes, the next logical step to support L3 handoff for an active AT is to move the control of the connection state from the lAP and make it locjil to each NF in the active set. This is done by defining multiple control routes (or control stacks) and defining the air interface so that the control stacks are independent and local to each NF. This may require that some of the negotiating and managing the al location and tear down of resources of the connection state is transferred to the AT since (here is no longer a single NF to manage all the members of the active set. It may also make some additional requirements on the air interface design to avoid a tight coupling between TFs - since different TFs may not share the same NF - in the active set. For instance, to operate in an optimal way, it is preferable to eliminate all tight synchronization between TFs that do not have the same NF, such as power control loops, soft handoff, etc.<br>
[0064]     Pushing the data and connection state down to tlie NFs eliminates the need to transfer this state on a L3 handoff, and also should make the NF-to-NF interface simpler.<br>
[0065]     The system therefore defines multiple independent data and control stacks (called interfaces in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4), in the AT to communicate with different NFs as needed, as well as the addressing mechanisms for the AT and TFs to logically distinguish between these stacks.<br>
[0066]     Fundamentally, some session state (QoS profile, security keys, attribute values, etc.) cannot be made local to an NF (or lAP) because it is too expensive to negotiate every time there is a NF (or a L3) handoff Also the session state is relatively static and easy to transfer. What is needed are mechanisms to manage and update the session state as it changes and during lAP handoff where the session master moves.<br>
[0067]     Optimizing the session state transfer for L3 handoff is a useful feature for every system regardless of the network architecture since it simplifies network interfaces and should also improve the seamlessness of handoff.<br>
Control vs. awareness of handoff<br>
[0068]     A separate but related issue is the AT control of L3 handoff. Today, in systems like DO and 802.20, the AT is aware of the L3 handoff since it allocates and<br><br>
tears down local stacks, but it has no control of when L3 handoff occurs. This is called network-based mobility management. The question is whether to make AT the handoff controller, i.e., to use AT based mobility management?<br>
[0069]     To support fault tolerance and load balancing, the network needs either to be able to mal^e the handoff or have a mechanism to signal to the AT to do a handoff. Thus if AT based mobility management is used, the network still needs a mechanism to indicate when it should occur.<br>
[0070]    AT based mobility management has some obvious advantages, such as allowing for a single mechanism for inter and intra technology, or global and local mobility. It also simplifies the network interfaces further by not requiring the network elements to determine when to do handoff.<br>
[0071]     I lie primary reason systems like DO and 802.20 use network based tnobility is that AT based mobility is not optimized to work fast enough to support voice. A secondiiry reason is the tunneling overhead introduced by terminating the mobile IP tunnel H (for MIPv6) in the AT. The mobility latency can be solved by forwarding data using tunnels between the current and previous forward link serving sector, as well an possibly using bicasting, where the data is sent to multiple NFs in the active set simultaneously.<br>
L2 and L3 handoff<br>
In SimpleRAN, there are two types of handoff:<br>
Layei- 2 or L2 handoff refers to changing of the forward link or reverse link serving sector (TF).<br>
L3 handoff refers to changing of the lAP,<br>
L2 handoff should be as fast as possible in response to changing radio conditions. Systems like DO and 802.20 use PHY layer signaling to make L2 handoff<br>
fast.<br>
[0072] L2 handoff is transfer of the serving sector TF for the forward (FL) or reverse (RL) links. A handoff occurs when the AT selects a new serving sector in the active set based on the RF conditions seen at the AT for that sector. The AT performs<br><br>
filtered measurements on the RF conditions for the forward and reverse links for all sectors in the active set. For instance, in 802.20 for the forward link the AT can measure the SINR on the acquisition pilots, the common pilot channel (if present), and the pilots on the shared signaling channel, to select its desired FL serving sector. For the reverse link, the AT estimates the CQI erasure rate for each sector in the active set based on the up/down power control commands to the AT from the sector.<br>
[0073]     L2 handoff is initiated when the AT requests a different FL or RL serving sector via a reverse link control channel. Dedicated resources are assigned at a TF when it is included in the active set for an AT. The TF is already configured to support the AT before the handoff request. The target serving sector detects the handoff request and completes the handoff with the assignment of traffic resources to the AT. The forward link TF handoff requires a round trip of messaging between the source TF or lAP and target TF in order to receive data for the target TF to transmit. For reverse link TF handoff, the target TF may immediately assign resources to the AT,<br>
[0074]     Li handoff is the transfer of the lAP. L3 handofi' involves a HA binding update with the new lAP and requires a session transfer to the new lAP for the control-plane. L3 handoff is asynchronous to L2 handoff in the system KO that L2 handoff is not limited by MIPv6 handoff signaling speed.<br>
[0075]     L:3 handoff is supported over the air in the system by defining an independent roulc to each NF. Each flow provides multiple routes for transmission and reception of higher layer packets. The route indicates which NF processed the packet. For example, one NF may be associated at the TF and over the air as Route A, while another NF may be associated with Route B. A serving TF can simultaneously send packets to an AT from both Route A and Route B, i.e., from both NFs, using a separate and independent sequence space for each.<br>
[0076]    1 here are two key ideas in the system design to ensure the QoS treatment for a mobile and its traffic is retained over each handoff mode:<br>
Decoupling of L2 and L3 handoff<br><br>
[0077]     Reserving air interface resources and fetching the session at the target NF or TF before the handoff occurs to minimize the data flow interruption during the handoff. This is done by adding the target TF and NF to the active set.<br>
[0078]    The system is designed to separate L2 and L3 handoff in order to allow the system to support EF traffic during high rates of L2 handoff. L3 handoff requires a binding update, which is limited to a rate of 2 to 3 per second. In order to allow a faster L2 handoff rate of 20 to 30 Hz, L2 and L3 handoff are designed to be independent and asynchronous.<br>
[0079] For L2 handoff, the active set management allows all the TFs in the active set to be configured and dedicated resources assigned in order to be ready to serve the AT in the event of an L2 handoff.<br>
[0080]     Consider a Mobile Wireless Communication System with multiple access points (AP) that provide service to access terminals (AT). Many systems have an active set, which is a set of APs that have assigned resources to the AT. At a given point in time, an AT may be within range of radio communication with one of the APs, or for the purpose of battery power optimization and radio interference reduction, may communicate only with one carefully selected AP (serving AP). The problem considered here is the delivery of messages and data between the various APs in the system, such that the serving AP can deliver messages to and from the AT.<br>
APs can exchange data over an L2TP (layer two tunneling protocol) tunnel. If API has to send a message or data to the AT, while AP2 is the serving AP, then API first uses the L2TP tunnel to deliver the packet to AP2, and AP2 delivers this packet to the AT using a mechanism including the use of an identifier bit, e.g., a reprocess bit.<br>
Similarly, if the AT has to send a message or data to API, while AP2 is serving, it sends the message to AP2 with a remote bit set, and AP2 sends this packet to API via the L2TP tunnel.<br>
The L2TP headyr includes the following fields<br>
1.	UserlD: This is the address of the user to which the L2TP packet is addressed<br>
2.	ForwardOrReverse: This field identifies if the AT is the destination or the source of the packet.<br><br>
3.	FlowID: In one design, this field may be present only in forward link packets (packets destined to the AT), and it identifies the flow that the serving AP should UNe to deliver the packet to the AT<br>
4.	Securityl'ield: In one design, this field may be present only in reverse link packets (packets originated at the AT). The SecurityField may include an IsSecure bit, a Keylndex field (to identify the keys used for security operation) and a CryptoSync field.<br>
In an aspect, forward Link L2TP Packets are communicated, tlere we describe the process used by i,m AP to send and receive a forward link L2TP packet.<br>
An AP sends a i'orward link L2TP packet when it has data or a message to send to the AT. The AP forms the appropriate header and sends the L2TP ]racket to the serving AP (or if it does not know the identity of the serving AP, possibly by routing the packet tlirough a central node - the lAP).<br>
When an AP receives a forward link L2TP packet, it does the following steps<br>
1.	If the AP is not serving for the given UserlD (in the L2TP header), it forwards the packet to the current serving AP (possibly by routing the packet through a central node - the lAP)<br>
2.	If the AP is serving for the given UserlD, it delivers the packet to the AT using the RLP flow and associated QoS attributes for the given FlowID (in the L2TP header).<br>
In an aspect, reverse Link L2TP Packets are communicated. Here we describe the process used by an AP to send and receive a reverse link L2TP packet.<br>
An AP sends a reverse link L2TP packet when it receives a packet from the AT, and the remote bit is set for that packet. The first step for the AP sending the L2TP packet is address determination.<br>
[0081]     Address Determination: If the remote bit for the packet is set, the packet also includes an address field to identify which AP this packet .should be delivered to (target AP). The receiving AP maps the address field to the IP address of the AP. This mapping may be established by<br><br>
1.	An AT assisted method wherein messages describing a mapping are sent from the AT lo the AP, and the mapping information is then used by the AP to map between the address used over the airlink and the IP address.<br>
2.	A netwoik assisted method whereby mapping information provided by a central entity or by the target AP is used.<br>
3.	A PilotPK based method. In this case the address field may simply be equal to the Pilotl'N (or some upper bits of the PilotPN) of the AP corresponding to the address. The receiving AP knows the PilotPN and IP addresses of all neighboring APs as part of the network configuration (which itself may be network iissisted) and uses this information to map between the PN based address and corresponding IP address.<br>
4.	An lAP address method where a special address type is used by the AT to identify I he AP which is the Internet attacliment point for the AT. Each AP in an active sel of APs corresponding to an AT knows the IP address of the lAP for the parti*'ular AT and can map between the lAP address and IP address of the AT's lAl',.<br>
[0082]     A fter address determination, the AP sending the L2TP packet may also insert security related fields if needed, and as determined by the security design.<br>
When an AP receives a reverse link L2TP packet, it does the following steps<br>
1.	If the AP is not serving the given UserlD indicated in a received packet (in the L2TP tunnel), it ignores the packet<br>
2.	If the AP is serving the given UserlD of the received packet, it processes the packet as if the packet were received from its own MA(' (Media Access Control) layer. The processing of the packet may depend on the SecurityField received in the L2TP tunnel.<br>
[0083]     I'igure 5 is a flowchart 500 of an exemplary method of operating an access point to communicate information to an access terminal. Operation starts in step 502 where the access point is powered on and initialized and proceeds to step 504.
