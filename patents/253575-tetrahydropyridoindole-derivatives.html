Tetrahydropyridoindole derivatives<br>
Field of the invention:<br>
The present invention relates to novel tetrahydro pyridoindole derivatives and their use as potent CRTH2 receptor antagonists in the treatment of prostaglandin mediated diseases, to pharmaceutical compositions comprising these derivatives and to processes for their preparation. In particular, such derivatives may be used alone or in pharmaceutical compositions for the treatment of both chronic and acute allergic/immune disorders such as allergic asthma, rhinitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), dermatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, allergic nephritis, conjunctivitis, atopic dermatitis, bronchial asthma, food allergy, systemic mast cell disorders, anaphylactic shock, urticaria, eczema, itching, inflammation, ischemia-reperfusion injury, cerebrovascular disorders, pleuritis, ulcerative colitis, eosinophil-related diseases, such as Churg-Strauss syndrome and sinusitis, basophil-related diseases, such as basophilic leukemia and basophilic leukocytosis in humans and other mammals.<br>
Background of the invention:<br>
Prostaglandin D2 is a known agonist of the thromboxane A2 (TxA2) receptor, the PGD2 (DP) receptor and the recently identified G-protein-coupled "chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed on Th2 cells" (CRTH2).<br>
The response to allergen exposure in a previously sensitized host results in a cascade effect involving numerous cell types and release of a number of cytokines, chemokines, and multiple mediators. Among these critical initiators are the cytokines interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13, and IL-5, which play critical roles in Th2 cell differentiation, immunoglobulin (Ig)E synthesis, mast cell growth and differentiation, upregulation of CD23 expression, and the<br><br>
differentiation, recruitment, and activation of eosinophils. The stimulated release of the array of mediators, causes end-organ damage, including constriction and hyperresponsi-veness, vascular permeability, edema, mucous secretion, and further inflammation.<br>
Because of the number of responses targeted, corticosteroids have proven to be the most effective therapy. Rather than antagonizing these specific responses in a directed way, another approach is to alter the immune response, that is, to change the nature of the immunological response to allergen. CRTH2 is preferentially expressed on Th2 cells and is a chemoattractant receptor for PGD2 that mediates PGD2-dependent migration of blood Th2 cells. Chemoattractants are responsible for the recruitment of both Th2 cells and other effector cells of allergic inflammation, which can provide the conceptual basis for the development of new therapeutic strategies in allergic conditions.<br>
So far, few compounds having CRTH2 antagonistic activity have been reported in the patent literature. Bayer AG claims the use of Ramatroban ((3R)-3-(4-fluorobenzene-sulfonamido)-l,2,3,4-tetrahydrocarbazole-9-propionic acid) for the prophylaxis and treatment of allergic diseases, such as asthma, allergic rhinitis or allergic conjuvatitis (GB 2388540). Further, (2-tert.-butoxycarbonyl-l, 2, 3,4-tetrahydro-pyrido[4,3-b]indol-5-yl)-acetic acid and (2-ethoxycarbonyl-l, 2, 3,4-tetrahydro-pyrido[4,3-b]indol-5-yl)-acetic acid are disclosed by Kyle F. et al in two patent applications (US 5817756 and WO 9507294, respectively).<br>
Furthermore, oral bioavailability of the Ramatroban and its ability to inhibit prostaglandin D2-induced eosinophil migration in vitro has been reported (Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, 305(1), p.347-352 (2003)).<br>
Description of the invention:<br>
It has now been found that compounds of the general Formulae (I) and (II) of the present invention are CRTH2 receptor antagonists. These compounds are useful for the treatment of both chronic and acute allergic/immune disorders such as allergic asthma, rhinitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), dermatitis, inflammatory bowel disease,<br><br>
rheumatoid arthritis, allergic nephritis, conjunctivitis, atopic dermatitis, bronchial asthma, food allergy, systemic mast cell disorders, anaphylactic shock, urticaria, eczema, itching, inflammation, ischemia-reperfusion injury, cerebrovascular disorders, pleuritis, ulcerative colitis, eosinophil-related diseases, such as Churg-Strauss syndrome and sinusitis, basophil-related diseases, such as basophilic leukemia and basophilic leukocytosis.<br>
The compounds of general Formulae (I) and (II), especially those mentioned as being preferred, display high selectivity towards the CRTH2 receptor. No antagonistic effects (IC50 &gt;10 M-M) are observed on e.g. prostaglandin D2 receptor DPI; PGI2 receptor (IP), PGE2 receptors (EP1, EP2, EP3, EP4), PGF2 receptor (FP), thromboxane receptor A2 (TxA2), leukotriene receptors (CysLTl, CysLT2, LTB4), complement receptor (C5a), angiotensin receptors (ATI, AT2) or serotonin receptor 5HT2c.<br>
The solubility of compounds of general Formulae (I) and (II) in buffer at pH 7 is generally &gt;800 jig/ml.<br>
In vitro assays with rat and dog liver microsomes, or with rat and human hepatocytes revealed high metabolic stability for compounds of general Formulae (I) and (II), especially for those compounds mentioned as being preferred.<br>
The compounds of general Formulae (I) and (II), especially those mentioned as being preferred, do not interfere with cytochrome P-450 enzymes, e.g. they are neither degraded by, nor do they inhibit such enzymes.<br>
Excellent pharmacokinetic profiles have been observed for compounds of general Formulae (I) and (II), especially for those compounds mentioned as being preferred, after oral administration (10 mg/kg) to rats and dogs (bioavailability 20-80%, Tmax 30 min, Cmax 2000- 6000 ng/ml, low clearance, Tm 4-8 h).<br><br>
The compounds of general Formulae (I) and (II), especially those mentioned as being preferred, are efficacious in vitro, inhibiting PGD2-induced migration of eosinophils or other CRTH2 expressing cells in a cell migration assay. A number of techniques have been developed to assay such chemotactic migration (see, e.g., Leonard et al., 1995, "Measurement of a- and p-Chemokines", in Current Protocols in Immunology, 6.12.1-6.12.28, Ed. Coligan et al., John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. 1995). The compounds of the present invention are tested using a protocol according to H. Sugimoto et al. (J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2003,305(1), 347-52), or as described hereinafter: Purified eosinophils are labeled with a fluorescent dye, i.e. Calcein-AM and loaded in BD Falcon FluoroBlock upper inserts. Test compounds are diluted and incubated with eosinophils in the BD Falcon FluoroBlock upper inserts for 30 min at 37 °C in a humidified CO2 incubator. A constant amount of PGD2 is added to BD Falcon FluoroBlock lower chamber, at a concentration known to have a chemotactic effect on CRTH2 cells. As a control, at least one aliquot in the upper well does not contain test compound. The inserts are combined with the chambers and are incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in a humidified CO2 incubator. After an incubation period, the number of migrating cells on the lower chamber is counted using a fluorescent reader, i.e. an Applied Biosystems Cyto Fluor 4000 plate reader. The contribution of a test compound to the chemotactic activity of PGD2 is measured by comparing the chemotactic activity of the aliquots containing only dilution buffer with the activity of aliquots containing a test compound. If addition of the test compound to the solution results in a decrease in the number of cells detected in the lower chamber relative to the number of cells detected using a solution containing only PGD2, then there is identified an antagonist of PGD2 induction of chemotactic activity of eosinophils.<br>
The compounds of general Formulae (I) and (II), especially those mentioned as being preferred, are efficacious in vivo by suppressing allergic reactions in ovalbumin sensitized animals, such as eosinophil infiltration into the lung, coughing, and improving respiratory function. Such animal models are known to a skilled person, see e.g. W. Elwood et al. (Int. Arch. Allergic Immunol. 1992, 99, 91-97).<br><br>

Salt-forming groups are groups or radicals having basic or acidic properties. Compounds having at least one basic group or at least one basic radical, for example amino, a secondary amino group not forming a peptide bond or a pyridyl radical, may form acid addition salts, for example with inorganic acids. When several basic groups are present mono- or poly-acid addition salts may be formed.<br>
Compounds having acidic groups, such as a carboxy group or a phenolic hydroxy group, may form metal or ammonium salts, such as alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salts, for example sodium, potassium, magnesium or calcium salts, or ammonium salts with ammonia or suitable organic amines, such as tertiary monoamines, for example triethylamine or tri-(2-hydroxyethyl)-amine, or heterocyclic bases, for example N-ethyl-piperidine or N,N'-dimethylpiperazine. Mixtures of salts are possible.<br>
Compounds having both acidic and basic groups can form internal salts.<br>
For the purposes of isolation or purification, as well as in the case of compounds that are used further as intermediates, it is also possible to use pharmaceutically unacceptable salts, e.g. the picrates. Only pharmaceutically acceptable, non-toxic salts may be used for therapeutic purposes, however, and those salts are therefore preferred.<br>
The expression "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" encompasses either salts with inorganic acids or organic acids like hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, citric acid, formic acid, acetic acid, maleic acid, tartaric acid, benzoic acid, methanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, and the like that are non-toxic to living organisms. In case the compound of general Formula (I) is acidic in nature the expression encompasses salts with<br><br>
an inorganic base like an alkali or earth alkali base, e.g. sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, and the like which are also non-toxic to living organisms.<br>

Compounds of the invention may be manufactured by the application or adaptation of known methods, by which is meant methods used hereinafter or described in the literature, for example those described by Larock R. C. in "Comprehensive organic transformations: a guide to functional group preparations", VCH publishers, (1999).<br>
In the reactions described hereinafter, it may be necessary to protect reactive functional groups, for example hydroxy, amino, imino, thio or carboxy groups, where these are desired in the final product, to avoid their unwanted participation in the reactions. Conventional protecting groups may be used in accordance with standard practice, for<br><br>
example see Greene T. W. and Wuts P. G. M. in "Protective groups in organic synthesis" Wiley-Interscience (1999).<br>
Generally, tetrahydropyridoindole derivatives of general Formula (I) are prepared as shown in Schemes 1 and 2, by condensing phenylhydrazine of Formula 1 and 4-piperidone monohydrate hydrochloride of Formula 2 in a Fischer indole synthesis to produce tetrahydropyridoindole of Formula 3, using conditions known to a skilled person (e.g. M. H. Block et al., J. Med Chem. (2002), 45, 3509-3523). The nitrogen atom in Formula 3 is protected with a protecting group (PG), such as alkoxycarbonyl, preferably tert-butoxycarbonyl, or benzyloxycarbonyl, under standard conditions, affording a compound of Formula 4. Then, compound of Formula 4 reacts with a compound of Formula L-CH2CO2R in which R is an alkyl group, preferably ethyl or tert.-butyl and L is a leaving group, in the presence of a base, such as caesium carbonate, sodium hydride, potassium tert.-butanolate or the like, in a suitable solvent, such as acetone, tetrahydrofuran or dioxane, to generate a compound of Formula 5. Suitable L is a leaving group such as halo, in particular bromo or chloro; mesyloxy or tosyloxy. Preferably, the compound of Formula L-CH2CO2R is ethyl bromo-acetate. Deprotection under standard conditions delivers an intermediate of Formula 6.<br><br><br><br><br>
As illustrated in Scheme 2, intermediate of Formula 6 reacts in Step a) with a reagent of Formula L-R5, where R5 is as defined in general Formula (I) hereinabove and L is a leaving group, such as hydroxy, or halo, in particular chloro or bromo. R5 transferring reagent of Formula L-R5 may be a chloroformate (Method A); or an acyl halide, preferably an acid chloride, or bromide, used as such (Method B); or generated in situ from the corresponding acid with a halogenating reagent under conditions known to a skilled person, preferably by means of oxalyl chloride or phosphorous oxychloride (Method C); or an acyl anhydride, transferring R5 in the presence of a base, such as triethylamine, N,N-diisopropylethylamine, N-ethyl-morpholine, N-methylpiperidine, or pyridine, in a suitable solvent, such as dichloro-methane, tetrahydrofurane, or N,N-dimethyiformamide, to give a product of Formula 7.<br>
In another aspect, a carboxylic acid is used in the presence of a coupling reagent (Method D), such as 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, diisopropylcarbodiimid, O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1--<br><br>
yl)-N,N,N',N',-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate and the like, in the presence of a base described hereinabove, to give an amide of Formula 7.<br>
In a further aspect, isocyanates or isothiocyanates (Method E), or alkylhalides (Method F) are used in the presence of a base to form products of Formula 7.<br>
Hydrolysis of the ester group R in Formula 7 can be carried out using routine procedures, as outlined in Scheme 2, Step b), for example by stirring with aqueous sodium hydroxide, or trifluoroacetic acid to give a compound of general Formula (I).<br>
Alternatively, tetrahydropyridoindoles of general Formula (I) can be synthesized in three consecutive steps as outlined in Scheme 3, starting from abovementioned Fischer indole product of Formula 3, which is reacted first in a substitution reaction with abovementioned reagent of Formula L-R5, using conditions as described in Methods A to F, to give a compound of Formula 8. Subsequent alkylation of the indole nitrogen can be performed with a compound of the abovementioned Formula L-CH2CO2R, in which R and L is as defined above, under conditions as described in Scheme 1 for the alkylation of compound of Formula 4, to give a precursor of Formula 7. Final deprotection under standard conditions, as outlined in Scheme 2, Step b) delivers a compound of general Formula (I).<br><br><br>

Preparation of CRTH2 membranes and radioligand binding assay:<br>
Preparation of the membranes and radioligand binding assays are performed according to known procedures, e.g. Sawyer N. et al. (Br. 1 Pharmacol, 2002,137,1163-1172). A clonal HEK 293 cell line, expressing high level of recombinant hCRTH2 receptor, is selected for the preparation of membranes. Cells are detached from culture plates in 5 ml buffer A per plate (5 mM Tris, 1 mM MgCl2x6 H2O, 0.1 mM PMSF, 0.1 mM phenanthroline) using a police rubber and transferred into centrifugation tubes and frozen at -80°C. After thawing, the cells are centrifuged at 500 g for 5 min and then resuspended in buffer A. Cells are then fragmented by homogenization with a Polytron homogenizer for 30 s. The membrane fragments are centrifuged at 3000 g for 40 min and resuspended in membranes in buffer B (50 mM Tris, 25 mM MgCb, 250 mM saccharose, pH 7.4) and aliquots are stored frozen.<br>
Binding assay is performed in a total volume of 250µl. In each well, 75 µl buffer C (50 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% BSA (protease free), 0.01 % NaN3, pH 7.4) is mixed with 50 µl {3H}-PGD2 (at 2.5 nM (220.000 dpm per well) from Amersham, TRK734), 100 µl CRTH2 membranes to give 80 µg per well and 25 µl of test compound in buffer C containing 1% DMSO. For unspecific binding, PGD2 is added to the reaction mixture at 1 µM final concentration. This binding assay mix is incubated at rt for 90 min and then filtered through a GF/C filter plate. The filter is washed three times with ice cold binding buffer. Then, 40 µl per well Microscint-40 (Packard) are added and the bound radioactivity is quantified by means of Topcount (Packard).<br><br>

Stock solutions of test compounds are made up at a concentration of 10 mM in DMSO, and serially diluted in assay buffer to concentrations required for inhibition dose response curves. Prostaglandin D2 (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) is used as an agonist.<br>
A FLIPR384 instrument (Molecular Devices) is operated according to the manufacturer's standard instructions, adding 4 pi of test compound dissolved at 10mM in DMSO and diluted prior to the experiment in assay buffer to obtain the desired final concentration. 10µl of 80 nM prostaglandin D2 (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) in assay buffer, supplemented with 0.8% bovine serum albumin (fatty acid content 
 <br>
obtain a final concentration of lOnM and 0.1 %, respectively. Changes in fluorescence are monitored before and after the addition of test compounds at λex=488 nm and λem=540 nm, Emission peak values above base level after prostaglandin D2 addition are exported after base line subtraction. Values are normalized to high-level control (no test compound added) after subtraction of base line value (no prostaglandin D2 added). The program XLlfit 3.0 (IDBS) is used to fit the data to a single site dose response curve of the equation (A+((B-A)/(l+((C/x)AD)))) and to calculate the IC50 values.<br>
