THE PATENTS ACT 1970 [39 OF 1970]<br>
&amp;       THE PATENTS RULES, 2003 COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[Set Section 10]<br>
'COMPOSITIONS FOR CONTROLLING ANIMAL PESTS"<br>
BAYER CROPSCIENCE AG,  Germany of Alfred-Nobel-Str.  50,  40789 Monheim, Germany,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
GRANTED<br><br><br><br>
9-2-2007<br><br>
The present invention relates to compositions for controlling animal<br>
pests and a process thereof<br>
The   present   invention   relates   to   novel   combinations   of  active   compounds<br>
	comprising, firstly, the known active compound clothianidin and, secondly, at least<br>
one further known insecticidally active compound, which combinations have very good insecticidal and acaricidal properties.<br>
It is already known that clothianidin of the formula <br><br><br>
can be used for controlling animal pests, in particular insects (cf. EP-A-376 279 and<br>
EP 375 907). The activity of this compound is good; however, at low application<br>
	rates or against individual pests, it is sometimes unsatisfactory.<br>
It is also known that the compounds abamectin (II) (DE 2 717 040), emamectin (III)<br>
or emamectin benzoate (III) (EP 089 202), methiocarb (IV) (US 3,313,684), p-<br>
cyfluthrin (V) (EP 206 149) and lambda-cyhalothrin (VI) (EP 106 469) can be used<br>
	for controlling insects and/or acarids.<br>
It has now been found that mixtures, comprising clothianidin of the formula (I)<br><br>
	and at least one of the compounds  (II),  (III),  (IIIa),  (IV),  (V) and (VI) are<br>
synergistically active and suitable for controlling animal pests. Owing to this<br><br>
Le A 35 814-Foreigri Countries<br>
synergism, it is possible to use considerably smaller amounts of active compounds, i.e. the activity of the mixture is greater than the activity of the individual components.<br>
	The ratio of the compound of the formula (I) used to the compounds of the formulae<br>
(II) to (VI), and the total amount of the mixture to be used depends on the nature and the occurrence of the insects and/or acarids. For each application, it is possible to determine the optimum ratios and total amounts to be used in each case by test series.<br>
	A preferred mixture according to the invention comprises the active compound<br>
clothianidin of the formula (I) and abamectin (II). Abamectin is also known from "The Pesticide Manual", 11th Edition, British Crop Protection Council, 1997, page 3.<br>
In this mixture, the ratio of the active compounds can be varied within a relatively<br>
	wide range. The weight ratio of clothianidin to abamectin is preferably from 1:1 to<br>
50:1, in particular from 5:1 to 25:1.<br>
A further preferred mixture according to the invention comprises the active<br>
compound clothianidin of the formula (I) and emamectin (III) or emamectin benzoate<br>
	(IIIa). Emamectin and emamectin salts are also known as MK-244 from the Journal<br>
of Organic Chemistry, Vol. 59 (1994), 7704-7708, US-P-4,4874,794, US-P-5,5,288,710 and EP-00 089 202.<br>
In this mixture, the ratio of the active compounds can be varied within a relatively<br>
	wide range. The weight ratio of clothianidin to emamectin or emamectin benzoate is<br>
preferably from 1:1 to 500:1, in particular from 100:1 to 500:1.<br>
A further preferred mixture according to the invention comprises the active<br>
compound clothianidin of the formula (I) and methiocarb (IV). Methiocarb (TV) is<br>
	also known from "The Pesticide Manual", 11    Edition, British Crop Protection<br>
Council, 1997, page 813.<br><br>
Le A 35 814-Foreign Countries<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
In this mixture, the ratio of the active compounds can be varied within a relatively wide range. The weight ratio of clothianidin to methiocarb is preferably from 1:1 to 1:10, in particular from 1:1 to 1:5.<br>
A further preferred mixture according to the invention comprises the active compound clothianidin of the formula (I) and (3-cyfluthrin (V). (3-cyfluthrin is also known from "The Pesticide Manual", 11th Edition, British Crop Protection Council, 1997, page 295.<br>
In this mixture, the ratio of the active compounds can be varied within a relatively wide range. The weight ratio of clothianidin to (3-cyfluthrin is preferably from 1:1 and 10:1, in particular from 1:1 to 6:1.<br><br>
	A further preferred mixture  according to  the invention comprises the  active<br>
compound clothianidin of the formula (I) and lambda-cyhalothrin (VI). Lambda-cyhalothrin (VI) is also known from "The Pesticide Manual", 11th Edition, British Crop Protection Council, 1997, page 300.<br>
	In this mixture, the ratio of the active compounds can be varied within a relatively<br>
wide range. The weight ratio of clothianidin to lambda-cyhalothrin is preferably from 1:1 to 10:1, in particular from 1:1 to 6:1.<br>
The active compound combinations are suitable for controlling animal pests, in<br>
	particular insects, arachnids and nematodes, which are encountered in agriculture, in<br>
forestry, in the protection of stored products and of materials, and in the hygiene sector,<br>
and have good plant tolerance and favourable toxicity to warm-blooded animals. They<br>
may be preferably employed as crop protection agents. They are active against<br>
normally sensitive and resistant species and against all or some stages of development.<br>
	The abovementioned pests include:<br><br><br>
Accordingly there is provided compositions for controlling animal pests, comprising a synergistically active mixture of clothianidin of the formula (I)<br><br>
and at least one compound from the group consisting of abamectin, emamectin or emamectin benzoate and methiocarb.<br><br>

According to the invention, it is possible to treat all plants and parts of plants. By<br>
	plants are to be understood here all plants and plant populations such as desired and<br>
Le A 35 814-Foreign Countries<br><br>
plants can be plants which can be obtained by conventional breeding and<br>
optimization methods or by biotechnological and genetic engineering methods or<br>
combinations of these methods, including the transgenic plants and including plant<br>
cultivars which can or cannot be protected by plant breeders, rights. Parts of plants<br>
are to be understood as meaning all above-ground and below-ground parts and<br>
organs of plants, such as shoot, leaf, flower and root, examples which may be<br>
mentioned being leaves, needles, stems, trunks, flowers, shoot-bodies, fruits and<br>
seeds and also roots, tubers and rhizomes. Parts of plants also include harvested<br>
plants and vegetative and generative propagation material, for example seedlings,<br>
	tubers, rhizomes, cuttings and seeds.<br>
The treatment of the plants and parts of plants according to the invention with the<br>
active compound combinations is carried out directly or by action on their<br>
environment, habitat or storage area according to customary treatment methods, for<br>
	example by dipping, spraying, evaporating, atomizing, broadcasting, brushing-on<br>
and, in the case of propagation material, in particular in the case of seeds, furthermore by one- or multi-layer coating.<br>
The active compound combinations can be converted to the customary formulations,<br>
	such as solutions, emulsions, wettable powders, suspensions, powders, dusts, pastes,<br>
soluble powders, granules, suspension-emulsion concentrates, natural and synthetic materials impregnated with active compound and microencapsulations in polymeric substances.<br>
	These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixing the active<br>
compounds with extenders, that is liquid solvents and/or solid carriers, optionally with the use of surfactants, that is emulsifiers and/or dispersants and/or foam-formers.<br>
If the extender used is water, it is also possible to employ for example organic solvents as auxiliary solvents. Essentially, suitable liquid solvents are: aromatics such as xylene, toluene   or   alkylnaphthalenes,   chlorinated   aromatics   or   chlorinated   aliphatic<br><br>
Le A 35 814-F'oreign Countries<br><br><br><br><br>
hydrocarbons such as chlorobenzenes, chloroethylenes or methylene chloride, aliphatic<br>
hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane or paraffins, for example petroleum fractions,<br>
mineral and vegetable oils, alcohols such as butanol or glycol and also their ethers and<br>
esters, ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or<br>
	cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents such as dimethylformamide and dimethyl<br>
sulphoxide, and also water.<br>
Suitable solid carriers are:<br>
	for example ammonium salts and ground natural minerals such as kaolins, clays, talc,<br>
chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous earth, and ground synthetic minerals, such as highly disperse silica, alumina and silicates; suitable solid carriers for granules are: for example crushed and fractionated natural rocks such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite and dolomite, and also synthetic granules of inorganic and organic meals, and granules of organic material such as sawdust, coconut shells, maize cobs and tobacco stalks; suitable emulsifiers and/or foam-formers are: for example nonionic and anionic emulsifiers, such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, for example alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, alkylsulphonates, alkyl sulphates, arylsulphonates and also protein hydrolysates; suitable dispersants are: for example lignosulphite waste liquors and methylcellulose.<br>
Tackifiers such as carboxymethylcellulose and natural and synthetic polymers in the form of powders, granules or latices, such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl acetate, as well as natural phospholipids such as cephalins and lecithins, and synthetic phospholipids, can be used in the formulations. Possible other additives are mineral and vegetable oils.<br>
It is possible to use colorants such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide,<br>
titanium oxide and Prussian Blue, and organic dyestuffs, such as alizarin dyestuffs, azo<br>
	dyestuffs and metal phthalocyanine dyestuffs, and trace nutrients such as salts of iron,<br>
manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum and zinc.<br><br>
Le A 35 814-Foreign Countries<br><br>
The formulations generally comprise between 0.1 and 95% by weight of active compound, preferably between 0.5 and 90%.<br>
The active compound combinations according to the invention can be present in commercially available formulations and in the use forms, prepared from these formulations, as a mixture with other active compounds, such as insecticides, attractants, sterilizing agents, bactericides, acaricides, nematicides, fungicides, growth-regulating substances or herbicides. The insecticides include, for example, phosphoric acid esters, carbamates, carboxylates, chlorinated hydrocarbons, phenylureas and substances produced by microorganisms, inter alia.<br>

It is also possible to admix other known active compounds, such as herbicides or fertilizers and growth regulators.<br><br>
When used as insecticides, the active compound combinations according to the<br>
invention can furthermore be present in their commercially available formulations<br>
and in the use forms, prepared from these formulations, as a mixture with synergistic<br>
agents. Synergistic agents are compounds which increase the action of the active<br>
	compounds, without it being necessary for the synergistic agent added to be active<br>
itself.<br>

Industrial materials in the present connection are to be understood as meaning non¬living materials, such as, preferably, plastics, adhesives, sizes, papers and cards, leather, wood and processed wood products and coating compositions.<br>
Wood and processed wood products are materials to be protected, especially preferably, from insect infestation.<br>
Wood and processed wood products which can be protected by the agent according<br>
to the invention or mixtures comprising this are to be understood as meaning, for<br>
	example:<br>
building timber, wooden beams, railway sleepers, bridge components, boat jetties,<br>
wooden vehicles, boxes, pallets, containers, telegraph poles, wood panelling, wooden<br>
windows and doors, plywood, chipboard, joinery or wooden products which are used<br>
	quite generally in house-building or in building j oinery.<br>
The active compound combinations can be used as such, in the form of concentrates   or in generally customary formulations,  such as powders,  granules,  solutions, suspensions, emulsions or pastes.<br><br>
The formulations mentioned can be prepared in a manner known per se, for example by mixing the active compounds with at least one solvent or diluent, emulsifier, dispersing agent and/or binder or fixing agent, a water repellent, if appropriate siccatives and UV stabilizers and if appropriate dyestuffs and pigments, and also<br>
	other processing auxiliaries.<br>
The insecticidal compositions or concentrates used for the preservation of wood and wood-derived timber products comprise the active compound according to the invention in a concentration of 0.0001 to 95% by weight, in particular 0.001 to 60% by weight.<br><br>
Le A 35 814-Foreign Countries<br>
The amount of the compositions or concentrates employed depends on the nature and<br>
occurrence of the insects and on the medium. The optimum amount employed can be<br>
determined for the use in each case by a series of tests. In general, however, it is<br>
sufficient to employ 0.0001 to 20% by weight, preferably 0.001 to 10% by weight, of<br>
	the active compound, based on the material to be preserved.<br>
Solvents and/or diluents which are used are an organic-chemical solvent or solvent<br>
mixture and/or an oily or oil-like organic-chemical solvent or solvent mixture of low<br>
volatility and/or a polar organic-chemical solvent or solvent mixture and/or water,<br>
	and if appropriate an emulsifier and/or wetting agent.<br>
Organic-chemical solvents which are preferably used are oily or oil-like solvents<br>
having an evaporation number above 35 and a flashpoint above 30°C, preferably<br>
above 45°C. Substances which are used as such oily or oil-like water-insoluble<br>
	solvents of low volatility are appropriate mineral oils or aromatic fractions thereof, or<br>
solvent mixtures containing mineral oils, preferably white spirit, petroleum and/or alkylbenzene.<br>
Mineral oils having a boiling range from 170 to 220°C, white spirit having a boiling<br>
	range from 170 to 220°C, spindle oil having a boiling range from 250 to 350°C,<br>
petroleum and aromatics having a boiling range from 160 to 280°C, terpentine oil and the like, are advantageously employed.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, liquid aliphatic hydrocarbons having a boiling range<br>
	from 180 to 210°C or high-boiling mixtures of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons<br>
having   a   boiling   range   from    180   to   220°C   and/or   spindle   oil   and/or monochloronaphthalene, preferably a-monochloronaphthalene, are used.<br>
The organic oily or oil-like solvents of low volatility which have an evaporation<br>
	number above 35 and a flashpoint above 30°C, preferably above 45°C, can be<br>
replaced in part by organic-chemical solvents of high or medium volatility, providing<br><br>
Le A 35 814-Foreign Countries<br><br>
that the solvent mixture likewise has an evaporation number above 35 and a flashpoint above 30°C, preferably above 45°C, and that the insecticide/fungicide mixture is soluble or emulsifiable in this solvent mixture.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, some of the organic-chemical solvent or solvent mixture is replaced by an aliphatic polar organic-chemical solvent or solvent mixture. Aliphatic organic-chemical solvents containing hydroxyl and/or ester and/or ether groups, such as, for example, glycol ethers, esters or the like, are preferably used.<br><br>
Organic-chemical binders which are used in the context of the present invention are the synthetic resins and/or binding drying oils which are known per se, are water-dilutable and/or are soluble or dispersible or emulsifiable in the orgamc-chemical solvents employed, in particular binders consisting of or comprising an acrylate<br>
	resin, a vinyl resin, for example polyvinyl acetate, polyester resin, polycondensation<br>
or polyaddition resin, polyurethane resin, alkyd resin or modified alkyd resin, phenolic resin, hydrocarbon resin, such as indene-curnarone resin, silicone resin, drying vegetable oils and/or drying oils and/or physically drying binders based on a natural and/or synthetic resin.<br><br>
The synthetic resin used as the binder can be employed in the form of an emulsion, dispersion or solution. Bitumen or bituminous substances can also be used as binders in an amount of up to 10% by weight. Dyestuffs, pigments, water-repelling agents, odour correctants and inhibitors or anticorrosive agents and the like which are known<br>
	per se can additionally be employed.<br>
It is preferred according to the invention for the composition or concentrate to<br>
comprise, as the organic-chemical binder, at least one alkyd resin or modified alkyd<br>
resin and/or one drying vegetable oil. Alkyd resins having an oil content of more<br>
	than 45% by weight, preferably 50 to 68% by weight, are preferably used according<br>
to the invention.<br><br>
Le A 35 814-Foreign Countries<br><br>
All or some of the binder mentioned can be replaced by a fixing agent (mixture) or a plasticizer (mixture). These additives are intended to prevent evaporation of the active compounds and crystallization or precipitation. They preferably replace 0.01 to 30% of the binder (based on 100% of the binder employed).<br>
The plasticizers originate from the chemical classes of phthalic acid esters, such as<br>
dibutyl, dioctyl or benzyl butyl phthalate, phosphoric acid esters, such as tributyl<br>
phosphate, adipic acid esters, such as di-(2-ethylhexyl) adipate, stearates, such as<br>
	butyl stearate or amyl stearate, oleates, such as butyl oleate, glycerol ethers or higher<br>
molecular weight glycol ethers, glycerol esters and p-toluenesulphonic acid esters.<br>
Fixing agents are based chemically on polyvinyl alkyl ethers, such as, for example, polyvinyl methyl ether or ketones, such as benzophenone or ethylenebenzophenone. <br>
Possible solvents or diluents are, in particular, also water, if appropriate as a mixture with one or more of the abovementioned organic-chemical solvents or diluents, emulsifiers and dispersing agents.<br>
	Particularly effective preservation of wood is achieved by impregnation processes on<br>
a large industrial scale, for example vacuum, double vacuum or pressure processes.<br>
The ready-to-use compositions can also comprise other insecticides, if appropriate, and also one or more fungicides, if appropriate.<br>
The active compound combinations according to the invention can also be used for protecting against colonization of articles, especially ships hulls, screens, nets, constructions, quays and signalling equipment, which come into contact with seawater or brackish water.<br><br>

Colonization by sessile Oligochaetae, such as Serpulidae, and by shellfish and species of the group Ledamorpha (goose barnacles), such as various Lepas and Scalpellum species, or by species of the group Balanomorpha (acorn barnacles), such as Balanus or Pollicipes species, increases the frictional resistance of ships and leads as a result, through increased energy consumption and frequent spells in dry dock, to a marked increase in the operating costs.<br>
In addition to colonization by algae, for example Ectocarpus sp. and Ceramium sp.,<br>
particular importance is attached to infestation by sessile Entomostraca groups,<br>
	which are comprised under the name Cirripedia (cirriped Crustacea).<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that the active compound combinations according to the invention have a good antifouling (anti-colonization) effect.<br>
	By using active compound combinations according to the invention it is possible to<br>
dispense with the use of heavy metals, such as, for example, in bis(trialkyltin) sulphides, tri-n-butyltin laurate, tri-«-butyltin chloride, copper(I) oxide, triethyltin chloride, tri-n-butyl(2-phenyl-4-chlorophenoxy)tin, tributyltin oxide, molybdenum disulphide, antimony oxide, polymeric butyl titanate, phenyl(bispyridine)bismuth<br>
	chloride, tri-n-butyltin fluoride, manganese ethylenebisthiocarbamate, zinc dimethyl-<br>
dithiocarbamate, zinc ethylenebisthiocarbamate, the zinc and copper salts of 2-pyridinethiol 1-oxide, bisdimethyldithiocarbamoylzinc ethylenebisthiocarbamate, zinc oxide, copper(I) ethylenebisdithiocarbamate, copper thiocyanate, copper naphthenate and tributyltin halides, or substantially to reduce the concentration of<br>
	these compounds.<br>
If appropriate, the ready-to-use antifouling paints may comprise yet further active compounds, preferably algicides, fungicides, herbicides, molluscicides or other active antifouling active compounds. <br><br>

The antifouling compositions used comprise the active compound in a concentration of from 0,001 to 50% by weight, in particular from 0.01 to 20% by weight.<br>
The antifouling compositions furthermore comprise the customary components as<br>
	described, for example, in Ungerer, Chem. Ind. 1985, 37, 730-732 and Williams,<br>

The coating compositions also optionally include inorganic pigments, organic<br>
	pigments or dyestuffs, which are preferably insoluble in salt water. The coating<br>
compositions may also comprise materials such as rosin, for a controlled release of<br>
the active compounds. The coats may also include plasticizers, modifying agents<br>
which influence the rheological properties, and other conventional constituents. The<br>
active compound combinations according to the invention can also be incorporated<br>
	into self-polishing antifouling systems.<br>
The active compounds are also suitable for controlling animal pests, in particular<br>
insects, arachnids and mites, which are encountered in closed rooms, such as, for<br>
example, flats, factory halls, offices, vehicle cabins and the like. They can be used on<br>
	their own or in combination with other active compounds and auxiliaries in<br>
household insecticidal products for controlling these pests. They are active against sensitive and resistant species and against all development stages. These pests include:<br>

Application is carried out in the form of aerosols, unpressurized sprays, for example pump and atomizer sprays, nebulizers, foggers, foams, gels, vaporizer products with vaporizer tablets made of cellulose or plastic, liquid vaporizers, gel and membrane vaporizers, propeller-operated vaporizers, energyless or passive vaporizer systems, moth papers, moth sachets and moth gels, as granules or dusts, in baits for scattering or bait stations.<br>
When using the active compound combinations according to the invention, the<br>
application rates can be varied within a relatively wide range, depending on the kind<br>
	of application. In the treatment of parts of plants, the application rates of the active<br>
compound combination are generally between 0.1 and 10 000 g/ha, preferably between 10 and 1 000 g/ha.<br>
The good insecticidal and acaricidal activity of the active compound combinations<br>
	according to the invention is evident from the examples below. While the individual<br>
active compounds exhibit weaknesses with regard to activity, the combinations have an activity which exceeds a simple addition of activities.<br>
A synergistic effect of insecticides and acaricides is always present when the activity<br>
	of the active compound combinations exceeds the total of the activities of the active<br>
compounds when applied individually.<br><br>
Le A 35 814-Foreign Countries<br>
Formula for the calculation of the synergistic activity of a combination of two active compounds<br>
The expected activity for a given combination of two active compounds can be calculated as follows (cf. Carpenter, C.S., "Mammalian Toxicity of 1-naphthyl-iV-methylcarbamate [Sevin Insecticide]", Agricultural and Food Chemistry, Vol. 9, No. 1, pages 30-39,1961):<br>
If<br>
Pa	is the proportion of active compound A in the mixture,<br>
Pb	is the proportion of active compound B in the mixture,<br>
LC50 (or 95) a        is the concentration at which 50% (or 95%) of the animals treated with active compound A are killed and<br>
LC50 (or 95) b        is the concentration at which 50% (or 95%) of the animals treated with active compound B are killed,<br>
1<br>
the expected LC 50 (0r 95) (comb.) =   	<br>
Pa                  Pb<br>
	+	<br>
LC 50(or 95) &amp; LC 50(or 95) b<br>
If the calculated LC 50 (or 95) exceeds the value actually obtained and is higher than the confidence interval, the activity of the combination is superadditive, i.e. a synergistic effect exists.<br><br>
