SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007] In the processes of Patent Publication 1 and Patent Publication 2, it<br>
was necessary to use a long-chain perfluoroalkanesulfonyl fluoride, which is<br>
not preferable in large-scale use, and a high-price, special organic base. In<br>
the dehydroxyfluorination reaction using a perfluoroalkanesulfonyl fluoride,<br>
a perfluoroalkanesulfonic acid is stoichiometrically produced as a by-product<br>
in the form of a salt of an organic base. Therefore, waste treatment of the<br>
acid was a large problem in conducing the reaction in large scale. In<br>
particular, long-chain perfluoroalkanesulfonic acid derivatives having a<br>
carbon number of 4 or greater are pointed out to have long-term persistence<br>
in environment and toxicity, and therefore their large-scale use is limited (for<br>
example, see FARUMASHIA Vol. 40, No. 2, 2004 with respect to<br>
perfluorooctanesulfonic acid derivatives).<br>
[0008] Also in the process of Non-patent Publication 1, there was a similar<br>
problem of using long-chain perfluorobutanesulfonyl fluoride.<br>
[0009] On the other hand, the processes of Patent Publications 3-6 are<br>
superior processes that are capable of avoiding problems of long-term<br>
persistence in environment and toxicity, since they use<br>
trifluoromethanesulfonyl fluoride having a carbon number of 1. The<br>
industrial production amount of trifluoromethanesulfonyl fluoride is,<br>
however, limited, as compared with perfluorobutanesulfonyl fluoride and<br><br>
perfluorooctanesulfonyl fluoride. Therefore, its obtainment in large amount<br>
was not necessarily easy.<br>
[0010] The process of Non-patent Publication 2 was not a direct<br>
fluorination reaction (see Scheme 1), due to its necessity of going through<br>
imidazole sulfate in order to convert the hydroxy derivative to the<br>
fluorosulfate.<br>
[Chemical Formula 1]<br>
Scheme 1<br><br>
[0011] According to Non-patent Publication 1, it is disclosed therein that,<br>
when the dehydroxyfluorination agent comprising trifluoromethanesulfonic<br>
anhydride, triethylamine tris(hydrogen fluoride) complex and triethylamine<br>
is used, gaseous trifluoromethanesulfonyl fluoride (boiling point: -21°C) is<br>
formed in the reaction system, thereby not achieving an efficient<br>
trifluoromethanesulfonylation of a hydroxyl group of the substrate, and that<br>
a combination with high-boiling-point (64°C) perfluorobutanesulfonyl<br>
fluoride (perfluorobutanesulfonyl fluoride, triethylamine tris(hydrogen<br>
fluoride) complex and triethylamine) is preferable. This description clearly<br>
indicates that low-boiling-point trifluoromethanesulfonyl fluoride is not<br>
preferable as a perfluoroalkanesulfonyl fluoride of the dehydroxyfluorination<br>
agent. Sulfuryl fluoride used in the present invention has a further lower<br>
boiling point (-49.7°C). Thus, it has been totally unclear whether or not<br>
that can preferably be used as the dehydroxyfluorination agent.<br>
[0012] As mentioned hereinbefore, there has been a strong demand for a<br>
novel dehydroxyfluorination means that is easy in large-scale operation, for<br>
producing fluoro derivatives.<br>
[0013] From the above viewpoint, the present inventors have conducted an<br>
eager examination to find a novel dehydroxyfluorination means that is easy<br><br>
in large-scale operation. As a result, we have found a novel<br>
dehydroxyfluorination agent comprising sulfuryl fluoride (SO2F2) and an<br>
organic base that is free from a free hydroxyl group in the molecule, thereby<br>
reaching the present invention.<br>
[0014] Sulfuryl fluoride (SO2F2) is a compound that is widely used as a<br>
fumigant. There has been, however, no report of using the compound as a<br>
dehydroxyfluorination agent.<br>
[0015] By conducting a dehydroxyfluorination using a<br>
dehydroxyfluorination agent of the present invention, it is possible to<br>
continuously conduct a fluorosulfonylation and a fluorine substitution in one<br>
reaction vessel without isolating a fluorosulfate that is a reaction<br>
intermediate. As shown in Scheme 2, the characteristic of the present<br>
invention is that a hydroxy derivative can be converted into a fluorosulfate<br>
by using sulfuryl fluoride and that "a salt or complex comprising an organic<br>
base and hydrogen fluoride", which has been stoichiometrically produced as<br>
a by-product in the reaction system in the step of this fluorosulfonylation,<br>
can be effectively used as a fluorine source of the fluorine substitution.<br>
[0016] Furthermore, as shown in Scheme 3, in the case of using "the above<br>
dehydroxyfluorination agent further comprising a hydrogen fluoride source<br>
(it refers to hydrogen fluoride or a salt or complex formed between hydrogen<br>
fluoride and an organic salt) added from the outside of the system", as<br>
compared with the process shown in Scheme 2, it was also found that the<br>
fluoro derivative can be obtained with high yield and selectivity.<br>
[Chemical Formula 2]<br><br><br>
[0017] In the present invention, sulfuryl fluoride has two reaction points to<br>
the hydroxyl group. However, in the case of using 4-hydroxyproline<br>
derivatives, which are particularly optically active hydroxy derivatives,<br>
1-β-D-arabinofuranosyluracil derivatives, optically active<br>
α-hydroxycarboxylate derivatives, and primary alcohol derivatives as<br>
hydroxy derivatives, it was found that a disubstituted sulfate is almost not<br>
given (see Scheme 4) and that the fluorine substitution proceeds well by<br>
going through the target fluorosulfate. We have clarified that such problem<br>
does not occur by perfluoroalkanesulfonyl fluoride and that sulfuryl fluoride<br>
can preferably be used as a dehydroxyfluorination agent.<br>
[Chemical Formula 4]<br><br><br>
[0018] Furthermore, the present inventors have found that<br>
stereochemistry of a fluoro derivative obtained by the reaction with sulfuryl<br>
fluoride is inverted, in the case of using as the hydroxyl derivative an<br>
optically active compound caused by chirality of the carbon atom that is<br>
covalently bonded with the hydroxyl group. In the present<br>
dehydroxyfluorination reaction, it is considered that the fluorosulfonylation<br>
proceeds with maintenance of stereochemistry and the subsequent fluorine<br>
substitution proceeds with inversion of stereochemistry. A<br>
dehydroxyfluorination reaction accompanied with such inversion of<br>
stereochemistry is also already disclosed in a process using a<br>
perfluoroalkanesulfonyl fluoride of Patent Publication 2. However,<br>
fluorosulfuric acid group is vastly inferior to perfluoroalkanesulfonic acid<br>
group in leaving ability [Synthesis (Germany) 1982, Vol. 2, p. 85-126].<br>
Therefore, it was unclear whether or not the reaction proceeds with high<br>
asymmetry transcription percentage in a dehydroxyfluorination reaction,<br>
using sulfuryl fluoride, of a chain substrate, which is difficult in control of<br>
stereochemistry, particularly an optically active orhydroxycarboxylate<br>
derivative. In contrast with this, the present inventors have found that a<br>
dehydroxyfluorination using sulfuryl fluoride of the present invention<br>
proceeds well under a very mild reaction condition and that an optically<br>
active α-fluorocarboxylate derivative, which is extremely high in optical<br>
purity, is obtained by the reflection of optical purity of the optically active<br>
orhydroxycarboxylate derivative, which is used as the raw material<br>
substrate.<br>
[0019] Furthermore, it was unclear whether or not fluorosulfates that are<br>
obtained by conversion of 4-hydroxyproline derivative and<br><br>
1-β-D-arabinofuranosyluracil derivative through fluorosulfonylation and<br>
that correspond to the respective raw material substrates have sufficient<br>
leaving abilities. In contrast with this too, the present inventors have found<br>
that a dehydroxyfluorination reaction using sulfuryl fluoride of the present<br>
invention can preferably be used as the process for producing 4-fluoroproline<br>
derivative and 2'deoxy2'-fluorouridine derivative.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0020] Advantageous points of the dehydroxyfluorination agent of the<br>
present invention are described in the following, as compared with prior art.<br>
[0021] Relative to the processes of Patent Publication 1, Patent Publication<br>
2 and Non-patent Publication 1, it is not necessary to use<br>
perfluoroalkanesulfonyl fluorides that are problematic in waste treatment,<br>
long-term persistence in environment and toxicity, and it is possible in the<br>
present invention to use sulfuryl fluoride, which is widely used as a<br>
fumigant.<br>
[0022] In the case of conducting a dehydroxyfluorination reaction using a<br>
dehydroxyfluorination agent of the present invention, fluorosulfuric acid is<br>
stoichiometrically produced as a salt of an organic base. It is, however,<br>
possible to easily treat the acid into fluorite (CaF2) as a final waste. It is<br>
thus extremely preferable for a fluorination reaction in large scale.<br>
[0023] Furthermore, the perfluoroalkyl moiety of perfluoroalkanesulfonyl<br>
fluoride is at last not incorporated into the target product. One having a<br>
less fluorine content is advantageous in atomic economy, as long as it has<br>
sufficient sulfonylation ability and leaving ability. From such a viewpoint<br>
too, sulfuryl fluoride is vastly superior.<br>
[0024] In a dehydroxyfluorination agent of the present invention, it is not<br>
necessary to use a high-price, special organic base such as DBU, and it is<br>
possible to use a low-price organic base, such as triethylamine, that is<br>
common in large-scale production.<br>
[0025] Relative to the process of Non-patent Publication 2, it is not<br>
necessary to go through imidazole sulfate. In the present invention, it is<br><br>
possible to directly convert a hydroxy derivative to a fluorosulfate by using<br>
sulfuryl fluoride.<br>
[0026] Furthermore, a new advantageous effect of the invention has been<br>
found by using sulfuryl fluoride. In a dehydroxyfluorination reaction using<br>
a perfluoroalkanesulfonyl fluoride, a salt of a perfluoroalkanesulfonic acid<br>
and an organic base is stoichiometrically contained in the<br>
reaction-terminated liquid. The salt, particularly a salt derived from a<br>
perfluoroalkanesulfonic acid having a carbon number of 4 or greater, has an<br>
extremely high solubility in organic solvent. We thus have found that there<br>
is a problem that it is not possible to effectively remove the salt and thereby<br>
it imposes a burden on the purification operation, even if conducting a<br>
post-treatment operation that is generally used in organic syntheses, such as<br>
washing of organic layer with water or alkali aqueous solution.<br>
Furthermore, a salt of perfluoroalkanesulfonic acid and organic base may act<br>
as an acid catalyst in some cases. Thus, it was necessary to efficiently<br>
remove the salt in order to produce a compound having an acid-labile<br>
functional group. Actually, if a large amount of a salt of<br>
perfluorobutanesulfonic acid and organic base is contained in a distillation<br>
purification of a crude product of 4-fluoroproline derivative, in which the<br>
protecting group of the secondary amino group is a tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc)<br>
group, debutoxycarbonylation reaction is found considerably. Thus, it was<br>
not possible to recover the target product with good yield. On the other<br>
hand, a salt of fluorosulfuric acid and organic base, which is produced as a<br>
by-product in the present invention, is extremely high in solubility in water.<br>
Therefore, it can perfectly be removed by washing the organic layer with<br>
water or alkali aqueous solution. Since it does almost not impose a burden<br>
on the purification operation, it was found to be extremely preferable for a<br>
fluorination reaction in large scale.<br>
[0027] A dehydroxyfluorination agent having characteristics disclosed in<br>
the present invention has not been disclosed at all in related technical fields.<br>
It is extremely useful as a dehydroxyfluorination agent in large scale, since it<br><br>
is very high in selectivity and does almost not produce as by-products<br>
impurities that are difficult in separation. In particular, it can extremely<br>
preferably be used for a large-scale production process of optically active<br>
fluoro derivatives, which are important intermediates of medicines,<br>
agricultural chemicals and optical materials, specifically 4-fluoroproline<br>
derivatives, 2'-deoxy-2'-fluorouridine derivatives and optically active<br>
α-fiuorocarboxylate derivatives, and monofluoromethyl derivatives. It is<br>
capable of remarkably efficiently producing them, as compared with<br>
conventional production processes.<br>
[0028] In the following, a dehydroxyfluorination agent of the present<br>
invention is described in more detail.<br>
[0029] It is possible to prepare a dehydroxyfluorination agent of the present<br>
invention by introducing sulfuryl fluoride into a container in which an<br>
organic base exists. In order to further improve reactivity, it is also possible<br>
to further add a hydrogen fluoride source (it refers to hydrogen fluoride or a<br>
salt or complex formed between hydrogen fluoride and an organic base) from<br>
the outside of the system. Furthermore, it is also possible to add an aprotic<br>
organic solvent in order to make the reaction proceed more smoothly.<br>
[0030] Herein, the container is desirably a pressure-proof airtight container,<br>
since sulfuryl fluoride is in gas under ordinary temperature and ordinary<br>
pressure.<br>
[0031] The order of adding the reagents and the preparation method are<br>
not particularly limited, (i) It is possible to prepare a dehydroxyfluorination<br>
agent of the present invention by previously placing an organic base that is<br>
free from a free hydroxyl group in the molecule (and, according to need, "a<br>
hydrogen fluoride source added from the outside of the system" and an<br>
aprotic organic solvent) in a container, then sealing it, and introducing<br>
gaseous sulfuryl fluoride thereinto, (ii) It is also possible to previously place<br>
each component of the above, except sulfuryl fluoride, and the reaction raw<br>
material (the hydroxy derivative) into a container and successively or<br>
continuously introduce sulfuryl fluoride thereinto. In the case of (ii), the<br><br>
dehydroxyfluorination reaction starts at the same time when the<br>
dehydroxyfluorination agent is prepared. Like (ii), to prepare a<br>
dehydroxyfluorination agent of the present invention in the reaction system<br>
(in situ) is simpler and easier in handling. On the other hand, in large-scale<br>
production, it is practical in some cases to introduce sulfuryl fluoride in<br>
liquid state under pressurized condition.<br>
[0032] The organic base used for a dehydroxyfluorination agent of the<br>
present invention is an organic base that is free from a free hydroxyl group<br>
in the molecule. In case that a free hydroxyl group exists in a part of the<br>
base molecule, it can preferably be used by protecting those hydroxyl groups<br>
with various protecting groups. However, as compared with the use by<br>
protecting such base, it is economically more preferable to directly use one<br>
that is generally available as an organic base with low price. In particular,<br>
a base is preferable that is selected from the group consisting of<br>
trimethylamine, triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, tri-n-propylamine,<br>
pyridine, 2,3-lutidine, 2,4-lutidine, 2,5-lutidine, 2,6-lutidine, 3,4-lutidine,<br>
3,5'lutidine, 2,3,4-collidine, 2,4,5-collidine, 2,5,6'collidine, 2,4,6-collidine,<br>
3,4,5-collidine, 3,5,6-collidine, and the like. Particularly, triethylamine,<br>
diisopropylethylamine, pyridine, 2,4-lutidine, 2,6-lutidine, 3,5-lutidine, and<br>
2,4,6-collidine are preferable.<br>
[0033] The present inventors have found that reactivity of the<br>
dehydroxyfluorination improves strikingly by further adding "hydrogen<br>
fluoride source" to the dehydroxyfluorination agent of the present invention.<br>
Herein, "hydrogen fluoride source" refers to hydrogen fluoride or a salt or<br>
complex formed between hydrogen fluoride and an organic base.<br>
[0034] As shown in Scheme 2, in the dehydroxyfluorination reaction of the<br>
present invention, firstly in the fluorosulfate formation, an equimolar<br>
amount of hydrogen fluoride (this hydrogen fluoride may form a salt or<br>
complex with the organic base) is generated in the system. This hydrogen<br>
fluoride becomes a fluorine source in the subsequent fluorine substitution,<br>
and it conducts a nucleophilic attack against the fluorosulfate of the reaction<br><br>
intermediate. With this, the fluorine substitution proceeds. This fluorine<br>
substitution is markedly accelerated when hydrogen fluoride is in an<br>
excessive condition by the addition of the hydrogen fluoride source from the<br>
outside of the system. In particular, it was found that a great effect is<br>
generated in the case of dehydroxyfluorinating a hydroxy derivative that is<br>
low in reactivity.<br>
[0035] In a dehydroxyfluorination agent of the present invention, the ratio<br>
of sulfuryl fluoride by mol number to the organic base is not particularly<br>
limited. However, as shown in Scheme 2, the ratio of sulfuryl fluoride,<br>
which is consumed in the dehydroxyfluorination reaction, by mol number to<br>
the organic base is 1:1 in theory. Therefore, in principle, it suffices that the<br>
ratio of both is about 1:1. However, it is possible in some cases to obtain a<br>
higher reactivity by excessively using one of both. Specifically, the ratio of<br>
sulfuryl fluoride by mol number to the organic base is preferably in a range<br>
of roughly 5:1-1:5.<br>
[0036] Furthermore, in the dehydroxyfluorination agent of the present<br>
invention, in the case of adding "hydrogen fluoride or a salt or complex<br>
formed between hydrogen fluoride and an organic base (e.g., triethylamine<br>
tris(hydrogen fluoride) complex)" as a hydrogen fluoride source from the<br>
outside of the system, the ratio of sulfuryl fluoride by mol number to the<br>
above hydrogen fluoride source (in terms of HF) is preferably in a range of<br>
roughly 3:1-1:10, more preferably in a range of 1:1-1:10. If the mol number<br>
(in terms of HF) of the hydrogen fluoride source is less than 1/3 of the mol<br>
number of sulfuryl fluoride, the effect of positively adding it is low. If it is<br>
greater than 10 times that, it becomes disadvantageous in economy and<br>
production.<br>
[0037] As these organic bases used for "the salt or complex comprising an<br>
organic base and hydrogen fluoride" added from the outside of the system, it<br>
is possible to preferably use any of the types mentioned as "the organic base<br>
that is free from a free hydroxyl group in the molecule", which is an essential<br>
element of the present invention. This organic base in the salt or complex<br><br>
may be of a type that is different from the organic base that is an essential<br>
element of the present invention, but being the same type is simple. Still<br>
triethylamine is one of particularly preferable ones.<br>
[0038] In the case of using a salt or complex comprising an organic base<br>
and hydrogen fluoride, the molar ratio of the organic base to the hydrogen<br>
fluoride in this salt or complex is in a range of 100:1-1:100, preferably in a<br>
range of 50:1-1:50 in general, more preferably in a range of 25:1-1:25 in<br>
particular. Furthermore, it is extremely convenient to use "a complex<br>
comprising 1 mol of triethylamine and 3 mols of hydrogen fluoride" and "a<br>
complex comprising ~30% (-10 mol%) of pyridine and -70% (~90mol%) of<br>
hydrogen fluoride", which are placed on sale from Aldrich (Aldrich,<br>
2003-2004 Comprehensive Catalogue).<br>
[0039] Apart from the above-mentioned organic base, it is desirable to<br>
further add an aprotic organic solvent in order to have a mutual affinity<br>
between sulfuryl fluoride and the organic base in a dehydroxyfluorination<br>
agent of the present invention. As such aprotic organic solvent, it is<br>
possible to mention aliphatic hydrocarbon series such as n-hexane,<br>
cyclohexane and n-heptane; aromatic hydrocarbon series such as benzene,<br>
toluene, xylene and mesitylene; halogenated hydrocarbon series such as<br>
methylene chloride, chloroform and 1,2'dichloroethane; ether series such as<br>
diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran and tert-butyl methyl ether; ester series such<br>
as ethyl acetate and n-butyl acetate; amide series such as<br>
N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide and N-methylpyrrolidone;<br>
nitrile series such as acetonitrile and propionitrile; dimethylsulfoxide,' and<br>
the like. Of these, n-heptane, toluene, mesitylene, methylene chloride,<br>
tetrahydrofuran, ethyl acetate, N,N-dimethylformamide,<br>
N,N-dimethylacetamide, acetonitrile, propionitrile, and dimethylsulfoxide<br>
are preferable. In particular, toluene, mesitylene, methylene chloride,<br>
tetrahydrofuran, N,N-diemethylformamide, and acetonitrile are more<br>
preferable. It is possible to use these reaction solvents alone or in<br>
combination.<br><br>
[0040] The amount of the aprotic organic solvent is not particularly limited.<br>
It suffices to use 0.1L (liter) or greater, preferably 0.1-20L in general, more<br>
preferably 0.1-10L in particular, relative to 1 mole of sulfuryl fluoride.<br>
[0041] By using a dehydroxyfluorination agent of the present invention, it<br>
is possible to continuously conduct the fluorosulfonylation and the fluorine<br>
substitution in one reactor without separation of the fluorosulfate, which is a<br>
reaction intermediate.<br>
[0042] Furthermore, in the fluorosulfonylation, stereochemistry of the<br>
hydroxyl group is maintained, and stereochemistry is inverted in the<br>
subsequent fluorine substitution. Therefore, 4-fluoroproline derivative in<br>
4S/2R configuration is obtained from 4-hydroxyproline derivative in 4R/2R<br>
configuration. Similarly, 4R/2R configuration from 4S/2R configuration,<br>
4S/2S configuration from 4R/2S configuration, and 4R/2S configuration from<br>
4S/2S configuration. Optically active crfluorocarboxylate derivative in S<br>
configuration at α-position is obtained from optically active<br>
α-hydroxycarboxylate derivative in R configuration at α-position. Similarly,<br>
R configuration at crposition is obtained from S configuration at a-position<br>
with good selectivity.<br>
[0043] [Regarding Hydroxy Derivative]<br>
According to a dehydroxyfluorination agent of the present invention,<br>
it is possible to substitute F atom for OH group of various hydroxy<br>
derivatives (they refer to compounds having at least one free hydroxyl group<br>
in the molecule). In the following, a hydroxy derivative, to which a<br>
dehydroxyfluorination agent of the present invention can be applied, is<br>
described.<br>
[0044] As a hydroxy derivative, to which a dehydroxyfluorination agent of<br>
the present invention can be applied, it is possible to cite a hydroxy<br>
derivative represented by the general formula [1],<br>
[Chemical Formula 5]<br><br><br>
[in the formula, each of R, R1 and R2 independently represents a hydrogen<br>
atom, alkyl group, substituted alkyl group, aromatic ring group, or<br>

is possible to obtain a fluoro derivative represented by the general formula<br>
[2],<br>
[Chemical Formula 6]<br><br>
[in the formula, R, R1 and R2 are defined as in the general formula [1]].<br>
[0045] When R, R1 and R2 of the hydroxyl derivative represented by the<br>
general formula [1] are alkyl groups, substituted alkyl groups, aromatic ring<br>
groups or alkoxycarbonyl groups other than hydrogen atoms, they also can<br>
have an optically active moiety caused by chirality of carbon atom, axis and<br>
the like. In these cases, stereochemistry of the optically active moiety is<br>
maintained through the fluorination reaction of the present invention.<br>
[0046] As a hydroxy derivative, to which a dehydroxyfluorination agent of<br>
the present invention can be applied, it is possible to cite a hydroxy<br>
derivative represented by the general formula [la],<br>
[Chemical Formula 7]<br><br>
[In the formula, each of R, R1 and R2 independently represents a hydrogen<br>
atom, alkyl group, substituted alkyl group, aromatic ring group, or<br>
alkoxycarbonyl group. The alkyl group is defined as being a C1C16<br><br>
straight-chain or branched alkyl group. The substituted alkyl group is<br>
defined as being an alkyl group, in which a halogen atom, lower alkoxy group,<br>

group, protected hydroxyl group, protected amino group, protected thiol<br>
group, or protected carboxyl group has been substituted therefor by any<br>
number and by any combination on any carbon atom of the alkyl group.<br>
Any carbon atoms themselves of any two alkyl groups or substituted alkyl<br>
groups may form a covalent bond to have an aliphatic ring, and carbon atoms<br>
of the aliphatic ring may be partially replaced with nitrogen atom or oxygen<br>
atom to have an aliphatic heterocyclic ring. The aromatic ring group is<br>
defined as being an aromatic hydrocarbon group or aromatic heterocyclic<br>

By dehydroxyfluorinating the present compound, it is possible to obtain a<br>
fluoro derivative represented by the general formula [2a],<br>
[Chemical Formula 8]<br><br>
[in the formula, R, R1 and R2 are defined as in the general formula [la]].<br>
[0047] The substituted alkyl group of R, R1 and R2 of the hydroxy derivative<br>
represented by the general formula [la] is defined as being "an alkyl group,<br>
in which a halogen atom of fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine; lower<br>
alkoxy group such as methoxy group, ethoxy group and propoxy group; lower<br>
haloalkoxy group such as fluoromethoxy group, chloromethoxy group and<br><br>

been substituted therefor by any number and by any combination on any<br>
carbon atom of the alkyl group".<br>
[0048] In the present specification, each of the following terms is used as<br>
having the following meaning. "Lower" means C1-C6 straight-chain or<br>
branched. In case that "unsaturated group" is a double bond, it can be in a<br>
geometrical isomerism of either E configuration or Z configuration.<br>
"Aromatic ring group" also can be an aromatic heterocyclic group (containing<br>
a condensed skeleton) containing oxygen atom, nitrogen atom, sulfur atom<br>
and the like, such as furyl group, pyrrolyl group and thienyl group, other<br>

with a protecting group that is generally used in the field of syntheses of<br>
nucleic acid related substances (For example, as a protecting group of<br>
hydroxyl group, it is possible to mention acyl groups such as acetyl group and<br>
benzoyl group; alkyl groups such as methoxymethyl group and allyl group;<br>
and aralkyl groups such as benzyl group and triphenylmethyl group. As a<br>
protecting group of amino group, it is possible to mention acyl groups such as<br>
acetyl group and benzoyl group and aralkyl groups such as benzyl group.<br>
Furthermore, halogen atom, lower alkyl group, lower alkoxy group and the<br>
like can be substituted in these protecting groups.). Furthermore, hydrogen<br>
atom, hydroxyl group and amino group of "nucleic acid base" can be replaced<br><br>
with hydrogen atom, amino group, halogen atom, lower alkyl group, lower<br>
alkenyl group nitro group and the like. As "protecting groups of hydroxyl<br>
group, amino group, thiol group and carboxyl group", it is possible to use<br>
protecting groups and the like described in Protective Groups in Organic<br>
Synthesis, Third Edition, 1999, John Wiley &amp; Songs, Inc. In "unsaturated<br>

lower alkylamino group, lower alkylthio group, cyano group, aminocarbonyl<br>

group, protected carboxyl group, and the like.<br>
[0049] Alkyl group and substituted alkyl group of R, R1 and R2 of the<br>
hydroxy derivative represented by the general formula [la] also can be an<br>
aliphatic ring, such as cyclopentane ring and cyclohexane ring, by the<br>
formation of a covalent bond by any carbon atoms of any two alkyl groups or<br>
substituted alkyl groups. They also can be an aliphatic heterocyclic ring,<br>
such as pyrrolidine ring (also containing a protected secondary amino group),<br>
piperidine ring (also containing a protected secondary amino group), oxolane<br>
ring and oxane ring, in which carbon atoms of the aliphatic ring have been<br>
partially replaced with nitrogen atoms or oxygen atoms.<br>
[0050] Aromatic ring group of R, R1 and R2 of the hydroxy derivative<br>
represented by the general formula [la] is defined as being "an aromatic<br>
hydrocarbon group, such as phenyl group, naphthyl group and anthryl group,<br>
or aromatic heterocyclic group containing oxygen atom, nitrogen atom, sulfur<br>

[0051] As a hydroxy derivative, to which a dehydroxyfluorination agent of<br>
the present invention can be applied, it is possible to cite an optically active<br>
hydroxy derivative represented by the general formula [3],<br>
[Chemical Formula 9]<br><br>
[In the formula, each of R and R1 is independently an alkyl group,<br>
substituted alkyl group, or alkoxycarbonyl group. * represents an<br>
asymmetric carbon (R and R' do not take the same substituent). The alkyl<br>
group is defined as being a C1-C16 straight-chain or branched alkyl group.<br>
The substituted alkyl group is defined as being an alkyl group, in which a<br>
halogen atom, lower alkoxy group, lower haloalkoxy group, lower alkylamino<br>

dehydroxyfluorinating the present compound, it is possible to obtain an<br>
optically active fluoro derivative represented by the general formula [4],<br>
[Chemical Formula 10]<br><br>
[In the formula, R, R1 and * are defined as in the general formula [3]].<br>
[0052] The dehydroxyfluorination reaction of the present invention<br>
becomes particularly effective for the production of high-optical-purity fluoro<br>
derivatives, which are required for important intermediates of medicines,<br>
agricultural chemicals and optical materials. In order to maximize this<br>
effect, the selection of the raw material substrate is important. Specifically,<br>
although it can be applied to optically active tertiary alcohol derivatives,<br>
which are sterically bulky, optically active secondary alcohol derivatives<br>
(corresponding to optically active hydroxy derivatives represented by the<br>
general formula [3]), which can be expected to have a high asymmetry<br>
transcription percentage, are still more preferable. Furthermore, the<br>
substituents of the optically active secondary alcohol derivative<br>
(corresponding to R and R' of the optically active hydroxy derivative<br>
represented by the general formula [3]) are preferably alkyl group,<br>
substituted alkyl group and alkoxycarbonyl group, as compared with<br>
aromatic ring groups, which are expected to be accompanied with a partial<br>
racemization by going through a transition state, such as the benzyl-position<br>
carbonium ion, in the course of the fluorine substitution of the fluorosulfate<br>
as the reaction intermediate.<br>
[0053] Due to the usefulness of the product to be obtained, the carbon<br>
number of the alkyl group is generally preferably 1 to 14, particularly more<br>
preferably 1 to 12. The substituents of the substituted alkyl group are<br>
preferably nucleic acid base, protected hydroxyl group, protected amino<br>
group, and protected carboxyl group. It is preferable that two alkyl groups<br><br>
or substituted alkyl groups take an aliphatic heterocyclic ring. The carbon<br>
number of the alkoxy group of the alkoxycarbonyl group is generally<br>
preferably 1 to 10, particularly more preferably 1 to 8.<br>
[0054] Furthermore, stereochemistry of the asymmetric carbon of the<br>
optically active secondary alcohol derivative (corresponding to the optically<br>
active hydroxy derivative represented by the general formula [3]) can be R<br>
configuration or S configuration. Enantiomer excess ratio (%ee) is not<br>
particularly limited. It suffices to use one having 90%ee or greater. In<br>
general, 95%ee or greater is preferable, and particularly 97%ee is more<br>
preferable.<br>
[0055] As a hydroxy derivative, to which a dehydroxyfluorination agent of<br>
the present invention can be applied, it is possible to cite a 4-hydroxyproline<br>
derivative represented by the general formula [5],<br>
[Chemical Formula 11]<br><br>
[In the formula, R3 represents a protecting group of the secondary amino<br>
group, R4 represents a protecting group of the carboxyl group, * represents<br>
an asymmetric carbon, and stereochemistry of the 4-position is inverted<br>
through the reaction, and stereochemistry of the 2-position is maintained.]<br>
By dehydroxyfluorinating the present compound, it is possible to obtain a<br>
4-fluoroproline derivative represented by the general formula [6],<br>
[Chemical Formula 12]<br><br><br><br>
[In the formula, R3, R4 and * are defined as in the general formula [5]].<br>
[0056] As the protecting group R3 of the secondary amino group of the<br>
4-hydroxyproline derivative represented by the general formula [5], it is<br>
possible to mention benzyloxycarbonyl (Z) group, tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc)<br>
group, 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) group, 3-nitro-2-pyridinesulfenyl<br>
(Npys) group, p-methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl [Z(MeO)] group, and the like.<br>
Of these, benzyloxycarbonyl (Z) group and tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group<br>
are preferable, and particularly tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group is more<br>
preferable.<br>
[0057] As the protecting group R4 of the carboxyl group of the<br>
4-hydroxyproline derivative represented by the general formula [5], it is<br>
possible to mention methyl (Me) group, ethyl (Et) group, tert-butyl (t-Bu)<br>
group, trichloroethyl (Tce) group, phenacyl (Pac) group, benzyl (Bzl) group,<br>
4-nitrobenzyl [Bzl(4"NO2)] group, 4-methoxybenzyl [Bzl(4"MeO)] group, and<br>
the like. Of these, methyl (Me) group, ethyl (Et) group and benzyl (Bzl)<br>
group are preferable, and particularly methyl (Me) group and ethyl (Et)<br>
group are more preferable.<br>
[0058] It is possible to produce the 4-hydroxyproline derivative represented<br>
by the general formula [5] from a commercial optically active<br>
4-hydroxyproline by referring to 4th Edition Jikken Kagaku Koza 22 Organic<br>
Synthesis IV Acid, Amino acid, Peptide (Maruzen, 1992, p. 193-309).<br>
Depending on a combination of the protecting group R3 of the secondary<br>
amino group and the protecting group R4 of the carboxyl group, there are<br>
commercial products, and it is also possible to use these. Of the<br>
4-hydroxyproline derivative represented by the general formula [5], it is<br>
possible to easily convert a hydrochloride of optically active 4-hydroxyproline<br>
methyl ester into one in which the protecting group R3 of the secondary<br>
amino group is a tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group and in which the protecting<br>
group R4 of the carboxyl group is a methyl (Me) group, in accordance with<br>
Tetrahedron Letters (United Kingdom), 1988, Vol. 39, No. 10, p. 1169-1172.<br>
[0059] As stereochemistry of the asymmetric carbon of the<br><br>
4-hydroxyproline derivative represented by the general formula [5], each of<br>
2-position and 4-position can independently take R configuration or S<br>
configuration. As a combination of stereochemistry, there is 4R/2R form,<br>
4S/2R form, 4R/2S form or 4S/2S form. Enantiomer excess ratio (%ee) or<br>
diastereomer excess ratio (%de) of each stereoisomer is not particularly<br>
limited. It suffices to use 90%ee or 90%de or greater, normally preferably<br>
95%ee or 95%de or greater, particularly more preferably 97%ee or 97%de or<br>
greater.<br>
[0060] As a hydroxy derivative, to which a dehydroxyfluorination agent of<br>
the present invention can be applied, it is possible to cite a<br>

[Chemical Formula 13]<br><br>
[In the formula, each of R5 and R6 independently represents a protecting<br>
group of the hydroxyl group.]. By dehydroxyfluorinating the present<br>
compound, it is possible to obtain a 2'-deoxy-2'-fluorouridine derivative<br>
represented by the general formula [8],<br>
[Chemical Formula 14]<br><br><br>
[In the formula, R5 and R6 are defined as in the general formula [7].].<br>
[0061] As the protecting groups R5 and R6 of the hydroxyl groups of the<br>
1-β-D-arabinofuranosyluracil derivative represented by the general formula<br>
[7], it is possible to mention trithyl group (triphenylmethyl group),<br>
tetrahydropyranil group (THP group), and tetrahydrofuranyl group (THF<br>
group). Of these, tetrahydropyranil group (THP group), and<br>
tetrahydrofuranyl group (THF group) are preferable, and particularly<br>
tetrahydropyranil group (THP group) is more preferable. It is possible to<br>
produce 1-β-D-arabinofuranosyluracil derivative represented by the general<br>
formula [7] by referring to Chem. Pharm. Bull. (Japan), 1994, Vol. 42, No. 3,<br>
p. 595-598 and Khim. Geterotsikl. Soedin. (Russia), 1996, No. 7, p. 975-977.<br>
It is possible to obtain one, in which hydroxyl groups of 3'-position and<br>
5'-position are selectively protected, by following the processes of these<br>
publications.<br>
[0062] As a hydroxy derivative, to which a dehydroxyfluorination agent of<br>
the present invention can be applied, it is possible to cite an optically-active,<br>
a-hydroxycarboxylate derivative represented by the general formula [9],<br>
[Chemical Formula 15]<br><br>
[In the formula, R7 represents a C1-C12 alkyl group or substituted alkyl group,<br>
R8 represents a C1-C8 alkyl group, any carbon atoms themselves of the alkyl<br><br>
group or of the substituted alkyl group of R7 and R8 may form a covalent<br>
bond to have a lactone ring, * represents an asymmetric carbon, and<br>
stereochemistry of the orposition is inverted through the reaction.]. By<br>
dehydroxyfluorinating the present compound, it is possible to obtain an<br>
optically-active, α-fluorocarboxylate derivative represented by the general<br>
formula [10],<br>
[Chemical Formula 16]<br><br>
[In the formula, R7, R8 and * are defined as in the general formula [9].].<br>
[0063] As R7 of the optically active orhydroxycarboxylate derivative<br>
represented by the general formula [9], it is possible to mention methyl<br>
group, ethyl group, propyl group, butyl group, amyl group, hexyl group,<br>
heptyl group, octyl group, nonyl group, decyl group, undecyl group, and<br>
lauryl group. The alkyl group having a carbon number of 3 or greater can<br>
be straight-chain or branched. On any carbon atom of the alkyl group, it is<br>
possible to substitute one or any combination of two of aromatic hydrocarbon<br>
groups such as phenyl group and naphthyl group, unsaturated hydrocarbon<br>
groups such as vinyl group, C1-C6 straight-chain or branched alkoxy groups,<br>
aryloxy groups such as phenoxy group, halogen atoms (fluorine, chlorine,<br>
bromine and iodine), protected carboxyl groups, protected amino groups, or<br>
protected hydroxyl groups. As the protecting groups of the carboxyl group,<br>
amino group and hydroxyl group, similar to the above, it is possible to use<br>
protecting groups described in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis,<br>
Third Edition, 1999, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. Specifically, it is possible to<br>
mention ester group and the like as the protecting group of the carboxyl<br>
group. It is possible to mention benzyl group, acyl groups (acetyl group,<br>
chloroacetyl group, benzoyl group, 4-methylbenzoyl group and the like), and<br>
phthaloyl group, and the like as the protecting group of the amino group. It<br>
is possible to mention benzyl group, 2-tetrapyranil group, acyl groups (acetyl<br><br>
group, chloroacetyl group, benzoyl group, 4-methylbenzoyl group and the<br>
like), silyl groups (trialkylsilyl group, alkylarylsilyl group and the like), and<br>
the like, as the protecting group of the hydroxyl group. In particular, it is<br>
possible to mention a protecting group or the like that forms<br>
2,2-dimethy1-1,3-dioxolane, as the protecting group of the 1,2-dihydroxy<br>
group.<br>
[0064] Although the production process, which is the target of the present<br>
invention, can be used even in case that R7 of the optically active<br>
orhydroxycarboxylate derivative represented by the general formula [9] is an<br>
aromatic hydrocarbon group, optical purity of the target product, optically<br>
active a-fluorocarboxylate derivative (R7 = an aromatic hydrocarbon group)<br>
represented by the general formula [10], lowers significantly, as compared<br>
with a case that R7 is an alkyl group or substituted alkyl group. Therefore,<br>
an alkyl group or substituted alkyl group is preferable as R7 of the optically<br>
active orhydroxycarboxylate derivative represented by the general formula<br>
[9].<br>
[0065] As R8 of the optically active a-hydroxycarboxylate derivative<br>
represented by the general formula [9], it is possible to mention methyl<br>
group, ethyl group, propyl group, butyl group, amyl group, hexyl group,<br>
heptyl group, and octyl group. The alkyl group having a carbon number of 3<br>
or greater can be straight-chain or branched.<br>
[0066] Stereochemistry of the asymmetric carbon of the optically active<br>
orhydroxycarboxylate derivative represented by the general formula [9] can<br>
be R configuration or S configuration. Enantiomer excess ratio (%ee) is not<br>
particularly limited. It suffices to use one having 90%ee or greater. In<br>
general, 95%ee or greater is preferable, and particularly 97%ee is more<br>
preferable.<br>

the general formula [9] can be produced similarly from various, commercial,<br>
optically-active, oramino acids by referring to Synthetic Communications<br>
(US), 1991, Vol. 21, No. 21, p. 2165-2170. A commercial product was used as<br><br>
(S)-ethyl lactate used in the Examples.<br>
[0068] As a hydroxy derivative, to which a dehydroxyfluorination agent of<br>
the present invention can be applied, it is possible to cite a primary alcohol<br>

[In the formula, R is defined as in the general formula [11].].<br>
[0069] In the development of medicines having new effectiveness,<br>
"monofluoromethyl group" is recognized as being an important motif. Thus,<br>
primary alcohol derivatives (corresponding to the primary alcohol derivative<br>
represented by the general formula [11]), which can efficiently produce<br><br>
monofluoromethyl derivatives (corresponding to the monofluoromethyl<br>

fluoride or a salt or complex formed between hydrogen fluoride and organic<br>
base) used in the dehydroxyfluorination agent of the present invention<br>
relative to lmol of the hydroxy derivative is not particularly limited. It<br>
suffices to use 0.3moles or greater, preferably 0.5-50 moles in general, more<br>
preferably 0.725 moles in particular.<br>
[0074] The temperature condition of the dehydroxyfluorination of the<br>
present invention is not particularly limited. It suffices to conduct it in a<br>
range of-100 to +100°C, preferably -80 to +80°C in general, more preferably<br>
-60 to +60°C in particular. In the case of conducting the reaction under a<br>
temperature condition that is not lower than boiling point (-49.7°C) of<br><br>
sulfuryl fluoride, it is possible to use a pressure-proof reaction vessel.<br>
[0075] The pressure condition of the dehydroxyfluorination of the present<br>
invention is not particularly limited. It suffices to conduct it in a range of<br>
atmospheric pressure to 2MPa, preferably atmospheric pressure to 1.5MPa<br>
in general, more preferably atmospheric pressure to 1MPa in particular.<br>
Therefore, it is preferable to conduct the reaction using a pressure-proof<br>
reaction vessel made of a material such as stainless steel (SUS) or glass<br>
(glass lining).<br>
[0076] The reaction time of the dehydroxyfluorination of the present<br>
invention is not particularly limited. It suffices to conduct it in a range of<br>
0.1 to 72 hours. Since it depends on substrate and the reaction conditions,<br>
it is preferable to determine the time, at which the raw material has almost<br>
disappeared, as the end point, while tracing the progress of the reaction by<br>
an analytical means such as gas chromatography, liquid chromatography, or<br>
NMR.<br>
[0077] The post-treatrrfent of the dehydroxyfluorination of the present<br>
invention is not particularly limited. Normally, it is possible to obtain a<br>
crude product by pouring the reaction-terminated liquid into water or an<br>
aqueous solution of inorganic base (for example, sodium hydrogencarbonate,<br>
potassium hydrogencarbonate, sodium carbonate or potassium carbonate) of<br>
alkali metal, followed by extraction with an organic solvent (for example,<br>
toluene, mesitylene, methylene chloride or ethyl acetate). A salt formed of<br>
fluorosulfuric acid and organic base or an alkali metal salt of fluorosulfuric<br>
acid, which is produced as a by-product from sulfuryl fluoride, is remarkably<br>
high in distribution to water. Therefore, it is possible to efficiently remove<br>
these salts by an easy operation such as washing with water and to obtain<br>
the target fluoro derivative with high chemical purity. According to need, it<br>
can be purified to have a higher chemical purity by activated carbon<br>
treatment, distillation, recrystallization and the like.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
[0078] In the following, embodiments of the present invention are<br><br>
specifically explained by examples. The present invention is, however, not<br>
limited to these examples.<br>

product was slightly greater than the weight of the theoretical yield.<br>
10.0mLof acetonitrile, and 1.10g (10.87mmol, 1.09eq) of triethylamine,<br>
followed by lowering the inside temperature to -40°C and then bubbling<br>

2.80g (20.26mmol, 2.03eq) of potassium carbonate and 50.0mL of water],<br>
followed by extraction two times with 50.0mL of ethyl acetate. The<br>
recovered organic layer was concentrated under reduced pressure, followed<br>
by vacuum drying, thereby obtaining a crude product of 4-fluoroproline<br>
derivative represented by the following formula,<br>
[Chemical Formula 20]<br><br>
Selectivity of the crude product was found by gas chromatography<br>
measurement to be 82.4% (As major three kinds of impurities were named<br>
Impurities A-C, Impurity A, Impurity B and Impurity C were respectively<br>
contained by 8.2%, 3.3% and 4.9%.) Instrument data of the crude product of<br>
the obtained 4-fluoroproline derivative are shown in the following (assigned<br>

thereby obtaining a crude product of 4-fluoroproline derivative represented<br>

inside temperature was returned to room temperature, and stirring was<br>
conducted for 22 hours and 10 minutes. Conversion of the reaction was<br>

and 100.0mL of water], followed by extraction two times with 45.0mL of<br>
mesitylene. The recovered organic layer was washed with a hydrochloric<br>
acid brine (prepared from 95.0mL of 1N hydrochloric acid and 10.00g of<br>
