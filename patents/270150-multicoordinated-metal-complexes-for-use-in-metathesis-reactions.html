				<td>MULTICOORDINATED METAL COMPLEXES FOR USE IN METATHESIS REACTIONS<br>
The present invention relates to multicoordinated metal complexes which are useful as catalyst components, either alone or in combination with co-catalysts or initiators, in a wide variety of organic synthesis reactions including the metathesis of unsaturated compounds such as olefins and alkynes.<br>
The present invention also relates to methods for making said multicoordinated metal complexes and to novel intermediates involved in such methods. More particularly, the present invention relates to multicoordinated complexes of metals such as but not limited to ruthenium wherein said complexes comprise a modified Schiff base ligand, as well as methods for making the same and the use of such multicoordinated metal complexes as catalysts for the metathesis of numerous unsaturated hydrocarbons such as non-cyclic mono-olefins, dienes and alkynes, in particular for the ring-opening metathesis polymerisation of cyclic olefins.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Olefin metathesis is a catalytic process including, as a key step, a reaction between a first olefin and a first transition metal alkylidene complex, thus producing an unstable intermediate metallacyclobutane ring which then undergoes transformation into a second olefin and a second transition metal alkylidene complex according to equation (1) hereunder. Reactions of this kind are reversible and in competition with one another, so the overall result heavily depends on their respective rates and, when formation of volatile or insoluble products occur, displacement of equilibrium.<br>
(Equation Removed)     <br>
Several exemplary but non-limiting types of metathesis reactions for mono-olefins or di-olefins are shown in equations (2) to (5) herein-after. Removal of a product, such as ethylene in equation (2), from the system can dramatically alter the course and/or rate of a desired metathesis reaction, since ethylene reacts with an alkylidene complex in order to form a methylene (M=CH2) complex, which is the most reactive and also the least stable of the alkylidene complexes.       (Equation Removed)    <br>
Of potentially greater interest than homo-coupling (equation 2) is cross-coupling between two different terminal olefins. Coupling reactions involving dienes lead to linear and cyclic dimers, oligomers, and, ultimately, linear or cyclic polymers (equation 3). In general, the latter reaction called acyclic diene metathesis (hereinafter referred to as ADMET) is favoured in highly concentrated solutions or in bulk, while cyclisation is favoured at low concentrations. When intra-molecular coupling of a diene occurs so as to produce a cyclic alkene, the process is called ring-closing metathesis (hereinafter referred to as RCM) (equation 4). Strained cyclic olefins can be opened and oligomerised or polymerised (ring opening metathesis polymerisation (hereinafter referred to as ROMP) shown in equation 5). When the alkylidene catalyst reacts more rapidly with the cyclic olefin (e.g. a norbornene or a cyclobutene) than with a carbon-carbon double bond in the growing polymer chain, then a "living ring opening metathesis polymerisation" may result, i.e. there is little termination during or after the polymerization reaction.<br>
A large number of catalyst systems comprising well-defined single component metal carbene complexes have been prepared and utilized in olefin metathesis. One major development in olefin metathesis was the discovery of the ruthenium and osmium -carbene-complexes-by-Grubbsand-e0-workers.-U.S7Paten^No-5;9777393-discloses-Schiff-base derivatives of such compounds, which are useful as olefin metathesis catalysts, wherein the metal is coordinated by a neutral electron donor, such as a triarylphosphine or a tri(cyclo)alkylphosphine, and by an anionic ligand. Such catalysts show an improved thermal stability while maintaining metathesis activity even in polar protic solvents. They are also able to promote cyclisation of, for instance, diallylamine hydrochloride into dihydropyrrole hydrochloride. Remaining problems to be solved with the carbene complexes of Grubbs are (i) improving both catalyst stability (i.e. slowing down decomposition) and metathesis activity at the same time and (ii) broadening the range of organic products achievable by using such catalysts, e.g. providing ability to ring-close highly substituted dienes into tri- and tetra-substituted olefins.<br>
International patent application published as WO 99/00396 discloses at least penta-coordinated ruthenium and osmium complexes including two anionic ligands and two monodentate neutral electron donor ligands and further wherein one of the coordinating ligands is a heteroatom-containing alkylidene of the formula = CH - Z - R, wherein Z is sulfur, hydrocarbylphosphino, oxygen or hydrocarbylamino, and wherein R is hydrocarbyl.<br>

The multidentate ligand of such an at least tetra-coordinated metal complex may be a bidentate or tridentate Schiff base. WO 2005/035121 also discloses hexa-coordinated metal complexes, salts, solvates and enantiomers thereof, comprising:<br>
a multidentate ligand being coordinated with the metal by means of a nitrogen atom and at least one heteroatom selected from the group consisting of oxygen, sulphur, selenium, nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic and antimony, wherein each of nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic and antimony is substituted with a radical R"" selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, C1-7 alkyl, C3-10 cycloalkyl, aryl and heteroaryl;<br>
at least one non-anionic bidentate ligand L3 being different from the multidentate ligand; and<br>
at most two anionic ligands L4, wherein one or more of said anionic ligands L4 may be each replaced with a solvent S, in which case the said hexa-coordinated metal complex is a cationic species associated with an anion A.<br>
The multidentate ligand of such an at least hexa-coordinated metal complex may be a bidentate or tridentate Schiff base. These tetra-coordinated and hexa-coordinated metal complexes of WO 2005/035121 proved to be very efficient olefin metathesis catalysts, especially in the ring opening metathesis polymerisation of norbornene and derivatives thereof.<br>
However there is a continuous need in the art for improving catalyst efficiency, i;e. improving the yield of the reaction catalysed by the said catalyst component after a certain period of time under given conditions (e.g. temperature, pressure, solvent and reactant/catalyst ratio) or else, at a given reaction yield, providing milder conditions (lower temperature, pressure closer to atmospheric pressure, easier separation and purification of product from the reaction mixture) or requiring a smaller amount of catalyst (i.e. a _higher_reactant/catalyst_ratio)-.and-thus-resulting-in-more- economic-and-environment— friendly operating conditions. This need is still more stringent for use in reaction-injection molding (RIM) processes such as, but not limited to, the bulk polymerisation of endo- or exo-dicyclopentadiene, or formulations thereof.<br>
WO 93/20111 describes osmium- and ruthenium-carbene compounds with phosphine ligands as purely thermal catalysts for ring-opening metathesis polymerization of strained cycloolefins, in which cyclodienes such as dicyclopentadiene act as catalyst inhibitors and cannot be polymerized. This is confirmed for instance by example 3 of U.S. Patent No. 6,284,852, wherein dicyclopentadiene did not yield any polymer, even after days in the presence of certain ruthenium carbene complexes having phosphine ligands. However, U. S. Patent No. 6,235,856 teaches that dicyclopentadiene is accessible to<br>
thermal metathesis polymerization with a single-component catalyst if carbene-free ruthenium(ll)- or osmium(ll)-phosphine catalysts are used.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,284,852 discloses enhancing the catalytic activity of a ruthenium carbene complex of the formula AxLyX2Ru=CHR', wherein x=0,1 or 2, y=0,1 or 2, and z=1 or 2 and wherein R' is hydrogen or a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl or aryl, L is any neutral electron donor, X is any anionic ligand, and A is a ligand having a covalent structure connecting a neutral electron donor and an anionic ligand, by the deliberate addition of specific amounts of acid not present as a substrate or solvent, the said enhancement being for a variety of olefin metathesis reactions including ROMP, RCM, ADMET and cross-metathesis and dimerization reactions. According to U.S. Patent No. 6,284,852, organic or inorganic acids may be added to the catalysts either before or during the reaction with an olefin, with longer catalyst life being observed when the catalyst is introduced to an acidic solution of olefin monomer. The amounts of acid disclosed in examples 3 to 7 of U.S. Patent No. 6,284,852 range from 0.3 to 1 equivalent of acid, with respect to the alkylidene moiety. In particular, the catalyst systems of example 3 (in particular catalysts being Schiff-base-substituted complexes including an alkylidene ligand and a phosphine ligand) in the presence of HCI as an acid achieve ROMP of dicyclopentadiene within less than 1 minute at room temperature in the absence of a solvent, and ROMP of an oxanorbornene monomer within 15 minutes at room temperature in the presence of a protic solvent (methanol), however at monomer/catalyst ratios which are not specified.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,284,852 also shows alkylidene ruthenium complexes which, after activation in water with a strong acid, quickly and quantitatively initiate living polymerization of water-soluble polymers, resulting in a significant improvement over existing ROMP catalysts. It further alleges that the propagating species in these reactions .is- stable_(a -propagating-alkylidene-species -was-observed -by-proton-nuelear-magnetie- -resonance) and that the effect of the acid in the system appears to be twofold: in addition to eliminating hydroxide ions which would cause catalyst decomposition, catalyst activity is also enhanced by protonation of phosphine ligands. It is also taught that, remarkably, the acids do not react with the ruthenium alkylidene bond.<br>
Although providing an improvement over existing ROMP catalysts, the teaching of U.S. Patent No. 6,284,852 is however limited in many aspects, namely:<br>
because its alleged mechanism of acid activation involves the protonation of<br>
phosphine ligands, it is limited to alkylidene ruthenium complexes including at least<br>
one phosphine ligand;<br>
- it does not disclose reacting a Schiff-base-substituted ruthenium complex with an acid under conditions such that said acid at least partly cleaves a bond between ruthenium and the Schiff base ligand of said complex.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,284,852 does not either teach the behaviour, in the presence of an acid, of ruthenium complexes wherein ruthenium is coordinated with a vinylidene ligand, an allenylidene ligand or a N-heterocyclic carbene ligand.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,284,852 therefore has left open ways for the study of multi-coordinated metal complexes, in particular multicoordinated ruthenium and osmium complexes in an acidic, preferably a strongly acidic, environment when used for olefin or alkyne metathesis reactions including ROMP, RCM, ADMET, and for cross-metathesis and dimerization reactions.<br>
Therefore one goal of this invention is the design of new and useful catalytic species, especially based on multicoordinated transition metal complexes, having unexpected properties and improved efficiency in olefin or alkyne metathesis reactions.<br>
Another goal of this invention is to efficiently perform olefin or alkyne metathesis reactions, in particular ring opening polymerization of strained cyclic olefins (including cationic forms of such monomers such as, but not limited to, strained cyclic olefins including quaternary ammonium salts), in the presence of multicoordinated transition metal complexes without being limited by the requirement of a phosphine ligand in said complexes.<br>
There is also a specific need in the art, which is yet another goal of this invention, for improving reaction-injection molding (RIM) processes, resin transfer molding (RTM) processes, pultrusion, filament winding and reactive rotational molding (RRM) processes such as, but not limited to, the bulk polymerisation of endo- or exo-dicyclopentadiene. or copolymerization thereof with other monomers, or formulations thereof. More specifically -there is-a need -to-improve such-processes-which-are-performed-in -the -presence -of multicoordinated transition metal complexes, in particular ruthenium complexes, having various combinations of ligands but which do not necessarily comprise phosphine ligands. All the above needs constitute the various goals to be achieved by the present invention, nevertheless other advantages of this invention will readily appear from the following description.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In a first aspect the present invention is based on the unexpected finding that improved catalysts useful in a number of organic synthesis reactions such as, but not limited to, the metathesis of unsaturated compounds such as olefins and alkynes can be<br>
obtained by bringing into contact a multi-coordinated metal complex, preferably an at least tetra-coordinated transition metal complex comprising a multidentate Schiff base ligand and one or more other ligands (such as, but not limited to, the metal complexes of WO 03/062253 or WO 2005/035121), with an activating metal or silicon compound selected from the group consisting of:<br>
-	copper (I) halides,<br>
zinc compounds represented by the formula Zn(R5)2, wherein R5 is halogen, C1-7<br>
alkyl or aryl,<br>
-	tin compounds represented by the formula SnR9R10RnR12 wherein each of R9, R10,<br>
R11 and R12 is independently selected from the group consisting of halogen, C1-20<br>
alkyl, C3-10 cycloalkyl, aryl, benzyl and C2-7 alkenyl, and<br>
silicon compounds represented by the formula SiR13R14R15R16 wherein each of <br>
Ri3,<br>
R14, R15 and Ri6is independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen,<br>
halogen, C1-20 alkyl, halo C1-7 alkyl, aryl, heteroaryl and vinyl,under conditions such<br>
that at least partial cleavage of a bond between the metal and the multidentate Schiff base<br>
ligand of said multi-coordinated metal complex occurs.<br>
In a second aspect the present invention is based on the unexpected finding that improved catalysts useful in a number of organic synthesis reactions such as, but not limited to, metathesis reactions of unsaturated organic compounds such as olefins and alkynes can be obtained by bringing into contact a multi-coordinated metal complex, preferably an at least tetra-coordinated transition metal complex comprising a multidentate Schiff base ligand and one or more other ligands (such as, but not limited to, the metal complexes of WO 03/062253 or WO 2005/035121), with an activating compound comprising at least one halogen atom directly bonded to at least one atom having an atomic mass from 27 to 124 and being selected from the group consisting of groups IB, -IIB, IIIA,. IVB, IVA-and VA-of-the-Periodic Table-of elements-under- eonditions-sueh-thatat least partial cleavage of a bond between the metal and the multidentate Schiff base ligand of said multi-coordinated metal complex occurs. The activating compound may further comprise, depending upon the nature of the atom having an atomic mass from 27 to 124, one or more hydrogen atoms and/or one or more saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbyl groups directly bonded to said at least one atom having an atomic mass from 27 to 124. The atom having an atomic mass from 27 to 124 may be a metal or a non-metal, according to the classification of elements standard in the art.<br>
In one specific embodiment, the present invention is based on the unexpected finding that new and useful catalytic species can be suitably obtained by reacting an activating compound such as defined herein-above with a multi-coordinated metal<br>
complex, preferably an at least tetra-coordinated transition metal complex comprising a multidentate Schiff base ligand and further comprising a set of one or more other ligands such as, but not limited to, anionic ligands, N-heterocyclic carbene ligands, alkylidene ligands, vinylidene ligands, indenylidene ligands and allenylidene ligands, wherein said set of other ligands is free from any phosphine ligand. More specifically, this invention is based on the finding that suitable conditions for the activation reaction between the activating compound and the multi-coordinated metal complex are conditions which permit, in one or several steps, the at least partial decoordination of the multidentate Schiff base ligand through cleavage of the imine bond to the metal center and optionally the coordination of the nitrogen atom of said Schiff base to the metal or silicon of the activating compound.<br>

In another specific embodiment, the present invention is based on the unexpected<br>
finding that useful catalytic species can be suitably obtained by reacting a metal or silicon<br>
activating compound such as defined hereinabove with respect to the first aspect of the invention, provided that said metal or silicon activating compound includes at least one halogen atom, or by reacting an activating compound such as defined with respect to the second aspect of the invention, with said multi-coordinated metal complex (preferably an at least tetra-coordinated transition metal complex comprising a multidentate Schiff base ligand such as specified herein-above) in the presence of at least one further reactant being an organic acid or having the formula RYH, wherein Y is selected from the group consisting of oxygen, sulfur and selenium, and R is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, aryl, arylalkyl, heteocyclic, heterocyclic-substituted alkyl, C2-7 alkenyl and C1-7 alkyl. According to this specific embodiment, a strong acid (such as a hydrogen halide) may be formed in situ by the reaction of said activating compound, e.g. metal or silicon activating compound, with said further reactant (e.g. a reactant having the formula RYH), and said strong acid if produced in sufficient amount may in turn be able:<br>
-	in a first step, to protonate the multidentate Schiff base ligand and decoordinate<br>
the nitrogen atom of the irnino group of said multidentate Schiff base ligand from<br>
the complexed metal, and<br>
-	in a second step, to decoordinate the further heteroatom of said multidentate Schiff<br>
base ligand from the complexed metal.<br>
In this specific embodiment, at least partial cleavage of a bond between the metal and the multidentate Schiff base ligand of said multi-coordinated metal complex occurs like in the absence of the further reactant (e.g. one having the formula RYH), but coordination of the nitrogen atom of the Schiff base ligand to the metal or silicon or other atom having an atomic mass from 27 to 124 of the activating compound occurs less frequently because it competes unfavourably with the protonation/decoordination mechanism resulting from the in situ generation of a strong acid (such as a hydrogen halide). This alternative mechanism is however quite-effective-in-the-catalysis of-metathesis-reactions-of-organic-compounds since it provides a more random distribution of the strong acid formed in the reaction mixture than if the same strong acid is introduced directly in the presence of the multicoordinated metal complex.<br>
The new catalytic species of the invention may be produced extra-temporaneously, separated, purified and conditioned for separate use in organic synthesis reactions later on, or they may be produced in situ during the relevant chemical reaction (e.g. metathesis of unsaturated organic compounds) by introducing a suitable amount of the (e.g. metal or silicon) activating compound into the reaction mixture before, simultaneously with, or alternatively after the introduction of the starting Schiff base metal complex. The present invention also provides catalytic systems including, in addition to<br>
said new catalytic species or reaction products, a carrier suitable for supporting said catalytic species or reaction products.<br>
The present invention also provides methods and processes involving the use of such new catalytic species or reaction products, or any mixture of such species, or such catalytic systems, in a wide range of organic synthesis reactions including the metathesis of unsaturated compounds such as olefins and alkynes and certain reactions involving the transfer of an atom or group to an ethylenically or acetylenically unsaturated compound or another reactive substrate, such as atom transfer radical polymerisation, atom transfer radical addition, vinylation, cyclopropanation of ethylenically unsaturated compounds, and the like. In particular, this invention provides an improved process for the ring opening polymerization of strained cyclic olefins such as, but not limited to, dicyclopentadiene.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In its broadest meaning, the present invention first relates to a method of modifying a multi-coordinated metal complex, a salt, a solvate or an enantiomer thereof, said multi-coordinated metal complex preferably comprising (i) at least one multidentate Schiff base ligand comprising an imino group and being coordinated to the metal, in addition to the nitrogen atom of said imino group, through at least one further heteroatom selected from the group consisting of oxygen, sulfur and selenium, and (ii) one or more other ligands, under conditions such that at least partial cleavage of a bond between the metal and the multidentate Schiff base ligand of said multi-coordinated metal complex occurs. The metal complex modification occurs by reaction with an activating compound, and may further optionally include:<br>
either the coordination of the nitrogen atom of said Schiff base to the activating<br>
compound,<br>
-	or the protonation of said multidentate Schiff base ligand, optionally followed by<br>
decoordination of said further heteroatom of said multidentate Schiff base ligand from<br>
the complexed metal,<br>
-	or both.<br>
In order to achieve this result, i.e. in order to effectively modify the structure of a starting multi-coordinated metal complex and preferably in order to modify said structure in such a way that the catalytic efficiency of the modified metal complex is higher than the catalytic efficiency of the starting non-modified metal complex in a given organic reaction such as the metathesis of unsaturated organic compounds, the activating compound must be suitably selected. According to the first aspect of the present invention, the activating compound must be selected within the groups of metal or silicon activating compounds -described- hereinaboveJn. the -summary of -the-invention-together-with reference to-speeifie formulae. For practical reasons it is preferred to use such compounds that are commercially available and, when such compounds are solid at room temperature, to use solutions of such compounds in suitable organic solvents such as, but not limited to, ethers (e.g. diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran), alcanes, aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g. toluene), esters (e.g. alkyl acetates), halogenated hydrocarbons and the like.

In order to achieve the desired metal complex modification, not only the activating compound must be suitably selected but also it is important to properly select its molar ratio to the multi-coordinated metal complex to be modified, as well as the other operating conditions of the modification reaction. Preferably, said conditions independently include one or more of the following:<br>
-	a molar ratio between said activating compound and the metal of said multi-<br>
coordinated meta! complex being above about 5:1, preferably above about 10:1, more<br>
preferably above about 20:1, for instance at least about 30:1;<br>
-	a molar ratio between said activating compound and the  metal of said multi-<br>
coordinated metal complex being not above about 2000:1, preferably not above about<br>
500:1, and more preferably not above about 250:1 ;<br>
-	a contact time above 5 seconds, preferably above 30 seconds, more preferably at<br>
least 1 minute, for example at least 5 minutes;<br>
-	a contact time below 100 hours, preferably not above 24 hours, more preferably not<br>

-	a contact temperature from about -50 °C to about 80 °C, preferably from about 10 °C<br>
to about 60 °C, more preferably from about 20 °C to about 50 DC.<br>
-According to.a first embodiment of-this invention-the-activating compound-is-used as the single species for modifying a multi-coordinated metal complex (or a salt, a solvate or an enantiomer thereof). As will be understood from the following description, this means that when the activating compound includes at least one halogen atom, it is not used in the presence of an additive such as water, an organic acid, an alcohol or a phenol that can abstract said halogen atom and replace the activating compound with another activating species. Such additives to be avoided for performing the first embodiment of this invention include, but are not limited to:<br>
-	impurities of the solvent that may be used for performing a metathesis reaction in the<br>
presence of the multi-coordinated metal complex,<br>
-	impurities of the unsaturated compound that may be submitted to a metathesis<br>
reaction in the presence of the multi-coordinated metal complex, and<br>
-	additives (e.g. antioxidants) deliberately present in the unsaturated compound that<br>
may be submitted to a metathesis reaction in the presence of the multi-coordinated<br>
metal complex.<br>
According to a second embodiment of this invention, the metal complex modification takes place in the further presence of a reactant being an organic acid or having the formula RYH, wherein Y is selected from the group consisting of oxygen, sulfur and selenium, preferably Y is oxygen, and R is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, aryi, heteocyclic, heterocyclic-substituted alkyl, arylalkyl, C2-7 alkenyl and C1-7 alkyl. In order for this specific embodiment to provide additional useful effect over the embodiment without said further reactant, especially by forming in situ a strong acid (such as a hydrogen halide) by the reaction of the activating compound with said further reactant (e.g. a reactant having the formula RYH), it is however necessary for the activating compound to include at least one halogen atom. The further reactant present in this embodiment of the invention thus has at least one labile hydrogen atom, such as water, monocarboxylic acids, monohydric alcohols and phenols, but may also have more than one labile hydrogen atom, such as polycarboxylic acids (in particular dicarboxylic acids), polyhydric alcohols, alcohols/phenols and polyphenols. Since water is also a further reactant according to this embodiment of the invention, it is not necessary for these mono-or polycarboxylic acids, monohydric or polyhydric alcohols, phenols or polyphenols to be used in strictly anhydrous grades but it is admissible to use them in the form of commercial grades including traces of water. Preferably the further reactant has no other functional group that may negatively interact with the hydrogen halide formation process, e.g. by providing the possibility for a competitive reaction with the halogen atom of the -activating .compound and thus-slowing-down-the-rate-of-the desired- hydrogen-halide formation. Therefore it may be important to purify a commercial grade of the further reactant when it is known or suspected to contain a significant amount of at least one impurity having such negatively interacting functional group. For practical reasons it is preferred to use reactants that are commercially available and, when such reactants are solid at room temperature, to use solutions of such reactants in suitable organic solvents such as, but not limited to, ethers (e.g. diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran), alcanes, aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g. toluene) and the like. Also for practical reasons for further use of the modified metal complex in organic synthesis reactions such as the metathesis of unsaturated compounds (e.g. olefins and alkynes), it is preferred that said organic solvents be the same as, or at least miscible with the organic solvent, if any, to be used<br>
for performing said organic synthesis reactions. The skilled person can readily determine, from general literature (such as the Handbook of Chemistry and Physics (e.g. 61st edition, 1980) or from standard solubility tests, which solvents are most appropriate for each individual further reactant.<br>

Within each above sub-class of suitable reactants, it may be important to pay attention to steric hindrance around the reactive carboxylic acid, alcohol or phenol group, since it is known that bulky groups such as, but not limited to, tert-butyl in the neighbourhood of said carboxylic acid, alcohol or phenol group may significantly reduce reactivity with the activating compound and, consequently, may significantly reduce the reaction rate of the metal complex modification, thus in turn resulting in slower reactivity with the unsaturated compound (such as olefin or alkyne) that is submitted to a metathesis reaction in the presence of the modified multicoordinated metal complex. This parameter may be suitably used in two ways:<br>
-	when the unsaturated compound is highly reactive under the selected reaction<br>
conditions and thus involves a risk of loosing control of the reaction, it may be<br>
appropriate to select a strongly sterically hindered further reactant such as 2-tert-<br>
butylphenol, 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-sec-butylphenol and the like, or<br>
when the unsaturated compound is hardly reactive under the selected reaction conditions, it may be appropriate to promote the desired reaction by avoiding sterically hindered further reactants or even linear or unsubstituted reactants. In order to achieve the desired metal complex modification of this second embodiment of the invention, not only the further reactant must be suitably selected according to the above recommendations but also it is important to properly select its molar ratio to the activating compound, as well as the other operating conditions of the modification reaction. Preferably, said conditions include one or more of the following:<br>
-	a molar ratio between said further reactant and said metal or silicon activating<br>
compound being such that each labile hydrogen atom of the further reactant (e.g. RYH<br>
or an organic acid) is able to react with each halogen atom of the metal or silicon<br>
activating compound; i.e. the suitable molar ratio depends  upon the number of<br>
. _. halogen-atoms-in-the-metaLor-silicon activating compound-(which-may-be -1- when-said-activating compound is a copper (I) halide, 2 when said activating compound is a zinc compound, and from 1 to 4 when said activating compound is a silicon compound or a tin compound) and depends upon the number of labile hydrogen atoms in the further reactant (which may be 1 when said further reactant is a monocarboxylic acid, a phenol, a C1-7 alkyl monoalcohol or an arylalkyl monoalcohol, or which may be 2 or more when said further reactant is a polycarboxylic acid, an alcohol/phenol or a C1-7 alkyl polyalcohol), thus a significant number of situations is likely to appear but in any situation the skilled is able to easily determine the proper molar ratio between the two reactive species that will provide a halogen hydride in situ;<br>
-	a contact time and/or a contact temperature similar to those specified in the previous<br>
embodiment of this invention.<br>
It should be understood that any combination of the above reaction conditions is contemplated as being within the framework of the present invention, and that the more suitable conditions depend upon the activating compound used and optionally upon the set of ligands around the metal center, especially upon the Schiff base ligand, but the more suitable combination of reaction parameters can easily be determined by the skilled person while performing standard optimization experimentation, based on the information contained therein.<br>
Certain phenols, in particular substituted phenols such as 2,6-di-terf-butyl-4-sec-butylphenol, are frequently used as antioxidants in commercial grades of some unsaturated compounds (such as olefms or alkynes) that may be submitted to a metathesis reaction in the presence of a modified multicoordinated metal complex according to this invention. In such a situation, the second embodiment of the invention is necessarily applicable and it is advisable to determine the exact amount of such substituted phenols being present in the unsaturated compound in order to calculate the suitable amount of activating compound to be used, taking into account the desired molar ratio between the reactive phenol and the activating compound, as well as the amount of the multicoordinated metal complex to be used as a catalyst for the metathesis reaction.<br>

at least one of said other ligands (ii) is an anionic ligand,<br>
at least one of said other liigands (ii) is a non-anionic ligand, e.g. one other than a<br>
carbene ligand.<br>
It should be understood that any combination of the above conditions is contemplated as being within the framework of the present invention, and that the more suitable conditions can easily be determined by the skilled person based on the general knowledge in the art and on information contained therein. Apart from the above-stated exception for amines, phosphines, arsines and stibines, usually the number and kind of said other ligands (ii) does not play a significant role in the feasability or efficiency of the metal complex modification according to the invention.<br>

. _More specifically, in such-at least penta-coordinated metal  complexes  (a5) of the fifth species, each said non-anionic ligand L7 may be cymene, and the d-7 alkylene or arylene linking group A may be substituted with one or more substituents preferably selected from the group consisting of chloro, bromo, trifluoromethyl and nitro.

Suitable but non limiting examples of tetradentate ligands (i) within the scope of this fifth species have one of the general formulae (IIA) and (IIB) shown in figure 2. More specific examples include the so-called salen (i.e. bis(salicylaldehyde) ethylenediamine), saloph (i.e. bis(salicylaldehyde)o-phenylenediamine), hydroxy-acetoph, and accac (i.e. bis(acetylacetone) ethylenediamine) ligands, and substituted derivatives thereof.

When the reaction product of this invention is produced by modifying a multi-coordinated metal complex (a) with an activating metal or silicon compound (b) in the presence of a further reactant (c) being an organic acid or having the general formula RYH, the molar ratio between, on the one hand, the hydrogen halide resulting from the reaction of (b) and (c) and, on the other hand, said multicoordinated metal complex (a) is an important parameter in the practice of the invention. Contrary to the teaching of the prior art (U.S. Patent No. 6,284,852), this ratio is not selected to perform ligand .protonatioa-(especially..since. another- preferred-feature of-this -invention is-the-absence- of-protonatable ligands in the multicoordinated metal complex), but is selected to achieve at least partial cleavage of a bond between the metal center of the multicoordinated metal complex (a) and at least one multidentate Schiff base ligand (i) of multicoordinated metal complex (a). Therefore it was found desirable to select high values for the said molar ratio, said high values resulting both from a molar ratio above 5:1 between the activating metal or silicon compound (b) and multicoordinated metal complex (a), and from a molar equivalent amount between the further reactant (c) being an organic acid or having the general formula RYH and said activating metal or silicon compound (b). Said molar ratio may be achieved step by step by progressively adding the reactant (c) to the multicoordinated metal complex (a) and the activating metal or silicon compound (b),<br>
optionally in the presence of a solvent system as previously mentioned, over the predetermined contact time. The addition rate of the reactant may be changed, depending upon the multidentate Schiff base ligand (i) and the selected temperature, according to routine experimentation.<br>
The progress of reaction with the multicoordinated metal complex (a) may be followed by one or more standard analytical techniques such as but not limited to infrared spectroscopy, carbon nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and proton NMR. These techniques will also be helpful in the determination of the precise nature of the reaction product of the invention. This nature may also be confirmed, after separation of the reaction product from the reaction medium and after its purification by suitable techniques (such as but not limited to re-crystallisation), by obtaining an X-ray diffractogram of the reaction product crystalline powder. Careful examination shows that the reaction product of the invention comprises the product of at least partial cleavage of a bond between the metal center and a multidentate Schiff base ligand (i). The bond that is partially cleaved as a result of the reaction may be a covalent bond or a coordination bond; it may be the bond between the rnetal center and the nitrogen atom of the Schiff base imino group, or it may be the bond between the metal center and the heteroatom (oxygen, sulfur or selenium) of the Schiff base ligand, or both such bonds may be simultaneously at least partially cleaved. The present invention does not require the said cleavage to be complete, thus partial bond cleavage leading to a mixture of the starting multicoordinated metal complex and of one or more reaction products is also within the scope of the invention. Because, as disclosed hereinafter, the modification reaction of the invention may be performed in situ in the presence of organic molecules or monomers such as unsaturated compounds (e.g. olefins, diolefins or alkynes) to be processed by the catalytic activity of the resulting reaction product, it is not essential that said reaction product may be isolated in the form -of-one.single pure chemical entity.<br>
In yet another aspect, the present invention also provides a supported catalyst, preferably for use in a heterogeneous catalytic reaction, comprising: (A) a catalytic system comprising a catalytically active reaction product of:<br>
(a)	a multi-coordinated metal complex, a salt, a solvate or an enantiomer thereof, said<br>
multi-coordinated meta! complex comprising (i) at least one multidentate Schiff<br>
base ligand comprising an imino group and being coordinated to the metal, in<br>
addition to the nitrogen atom of said imino group, through at least one further<br>
heteroatom selected from the group consisting of oxygen, sulfur and selenium, and<br>
(ii) one or more other ligands, and<br>
(b)	an activating metal or silicon compound selected from the group consisting of;<br>
-	copper (I) halides,<br>

alkyl or aryl,<br>
-	aluminum compounds represented by the formula AIR6R7R8 wherein each of R6,<br>
R7 and R8 is independently selected from the group consisting of halogen and C1-7<br>
alkyl,<br>
-	tin compounds represented by the formula SnRBR10R11R12 wherein each of R9, R10,<br>
R11 and R12 is independently selected from the group consisting of halogen, C1-20<br>
alkyl, C3-10 cycloalkyl, aryl, benzyl and C2-7 alkenyl, and<br>
-	silicon compounds represented by the formula SiR13R14R15R16 wherein each of R13,<br>
R14, R15 and R16 is independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen,<br>
halogen, Ci.20 alkyl, halo Ct.7 a!kyl, aryl, heteroaryl and vinyl, and<br>
(c) optionally a further reactant being an organic acid (such as defined hereinabove) or having the formula RYH, wherein Y is selected from the group consisting of oxygen, sulfur and selenium, and R is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, aryl, heteocyctic, heterocyclic-substituted alkyl, arylalkyl and C1-7 alkyl, and (B) a supporting amount of a carrier suitable for supporting said catalytic system (a).<br>
The catalytic system (A) included in the supported catalyst of this aspect of the invention may, in addition to the above-described reaction product, comprise one or more other catalytic species being known to the skilled person to exhibit catalytic activity in the reaction, for instance the metathesis reaction of an unsaturated compound, to be promoted. Such optional one or more other catalytic species should not be capable of negatively interfering with the components of the reaction product of the invention during the formation of said reaction product. For instance they should not be capable of desactivating the metal-or silicon compound (b)-and/or-the-optional-further reactant (e)-<br>
In such a supported catalyst, said earner (B) may be selected from the group consisting of porous inorganic solids (including silica, zirconia and alumino-silica), such as amorphous or paracrystalline materials, crystalline molecular sieves and modified layered materials including one or more inorganic oxides, and organic polymer resins such as polystyrene resins and. derivatives thereof.<br>
Porous inorganic solids that may be used as carriers (B) for the supported catalysts of the invention preferably have an open microstructure that allows molecules access to the relatively large surface areas of these materials, thereby enhancing their catalytic and/or sorptive activity. These porous materials can be sorted into three broad categories using the details of their microstructure as a basis for classification. These categories are the<br>
amorphous and paracrystalline supports, the crystalline molecular sieves and modified layered materials. The detailed differences in the microstructures of these materials manifest themselves in the catalytic and/or sorptive behavior of the materials, as well as in differences in various observable properties used to characterize them, such as their surface area, pore sizes, and pore size distribution, the presence or absence of X-ray diffraction patterns and the details in such patterns, and the appearance of the material microstructure when observed by transmission electron microscopy and/or electron diffraction methods. Amorphous and paracrystalline materials represent an important class of porous inorganic solids that have been used for many years in industrial applications. Typical examples of these materials are the amorphous silicas commonly used in catalyst formulations and the paracrystalline transitional aluminas used as solid acid catalysts and petroleum reforming catalyst supports. The term " amorphous " is used here to indicate a material with no long range order and can be somewhat misleading, since almost all materials are ordered to some degree, at least on the local scale. An alternate term that has been used to describe these materials is "X-ray indifferent". The microstructure of the silicas consists of 100-250 Angstrom particles of dense amorphous silica (Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 3rd. ed., vol. 20, 766-781 (1982)), with the porosity resulting from voids between the particles.<br>
Paracrystalline materials such as the transitional aluminas also have a wide distribution of pore sizes, but better defined X-ray diffraction patterns usually consisting of a few broad peaks. The microstructure of these materials consists of tiny crystalline regions of condensed alumina phases and the porosity of the materials results from irregular voids between these regions (K. Wefers and Chanakya Misra, "Oxides and Hydroxides of Aluminum", Technical Paper No 19 Revised, Alcoa Research Laboratories, 54-59 (1987)). Since, in the case of either material, there is no long range order controlling the sizes of pores in- the-material-the-variability-in -pore- size is- typically- quite high.-The-sizes of pores in these materials fall into a regime called the mesoporous range, including (for example) pores within the range of about 1.5 to about 20 nm.<br>
In sharp contrast to these structurally ill-defined solids, there are materials whose very narrow pore size distribution is controlled by the precisely repeating crystalline nature of the material's "microstructure. These materials are usually called " molecular sieves ", the most important examples of which are zeolites. Zeolites, both natural and synthetic, have been demonstrated in the past to have catalytic properties for various types of hydrocarbon conversion. Certain zeolitic materials are ordered, porous crystalline aluminosilicates having a definite crystalline structure as determined by X-ray diffraction, within which there are a large number of smaller cavities which may be interconnected by<br>
a number of still smaller channels or pores. These cavities and pores are uniform in size within a specific zeolitic material. Since their pore dimensions are such as to accept for adsorption molecules of certain dimensions while rejecting those of larger dimensions, these materials are known as " molecular sieves " and are used in various ways to take advantage of this property. Such molecular sieves, both natural and synthetic, include a wide variety of positive ion-containing crystalline silicates. These silicates can be described as a rigid three-dimensional framework of SiO4 and a Periodic Table Group IIIB element oxide, e.g., AI04l in which the tetrahedra are crosslinked by the sharing of oxygen atoms whereby the ratio of the total Group IIIB element, e.g., aluminum, and Group IVB element, e.g., silicon, atoms to oxygen atoms is 1:2. The electrovalence of the tetrahedra containing the Group IIIB element, e.g., aluminum, is balanced by the inclusion in the crystal of a cation, for example, an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal cation. This can be expressed wherein the ratio of the Group IIIB element, e.g., aluminum, to the number of various cations, such as Ca, Sr, Na, K or Li, is equal to 1. One type of cation may be exchanged either entirely or partially with another type of cation by using ion exchange techniques in a conventional manner. By means of such cation exchange, it has been possible to modify the properties of a given silicate by suitable selection of the cation. Many of these zeolites have come to be designated by letter or other convenient symbols, as illustrated by zeolites A (U.S. Pat. No. 2,882,243); X (U.S. Pat. No. 2,882,244); Y (U.S. Pat. No. 3,130,007); ZK-5 (U.S. Pat. No. 3,247,195); ZK-4 (U.S. Pat. No. 3,314,752); ZSM-5 (U.S. Pat. No. 3,702,886); ZSM-11 (U.S. Pat. No. 3,709.979); ZSM-12 (U.S. Pat. No. 3,832,449), ZSM-20 (U.S. Pat. No. 3,972,983); ZSM-35 (U.S. Pat. No. 4,016,245); ZSM-23 (U.S. Pat. No. 4,076,842); MCM-22 (U.S. Pat. No. 4,954,325); MCM-35 (U.S. Pat. No. 4,981,663); MCM-49 (U.S. Pat. No. 5,236,575); and PSH-3 (U.S. Pat. No. 4,439,409). The latter refers to a crystalline molecular sieve composition of matter made from. a. reaction-mixture containing hexamethyleneimine, an organic-compound which acts as directing agent for synthesis of a layered MCM-56. A similar composition, but with additional structural components, has been disclosed in EP-A-293,032: Hexamethyleneimine is also taught for making the crystalline molecular sieves MCM-22, MCM-35, MCM-49, and ZSM-12 (U.S. Pat. No. 5,021,141). A molecular sieve composition SSZ-25 is taught in U.S. Pat. No. 4,826,667 and EP-A 231,860, said zeolite being synthesized from a reaction mixture containing an adamantane quaternary ammonium ion. Molecular sieve material being selected from the group consisting of zeolites REY, USY, REUSY, dealuminated Y, ultrahydrophobic Y, silicon-enriched dealuminated Y, ZSM-20, Beta, L, silicoaluminophosphates SAPO-5, SAPO-37, SAPO-40 and MCM-9, metalloalumino-<br>
phosphate MAPO-36, aluminophosphate VPI-5 and mesoporous crystalline MCM-41 are also suitable for including as a carrier (B) into a supported catalyst of this invention.<br>
Certain layered materials, which contain layers capable of being spaced apart with a swelling agent, may be pillared to provide materials having a large degree of porosity. Examples of such layered materials include clays. Such clays may be swollen with water, whereby the layers of the clay are spaced apart by water molecules. Other layered materials are not swellable with water, but may be swollen with certain organic swelling agents such as amines and quaternary ammonium compounds. Examples of such non-water swellable layered materials are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,859,648 and include layered silicates, magadiite, kenyaite, trititanates and perovskites. Another example of a non-water swellable layered material, which can be swollen with certain organic swelling agents, is a vacancy-containing titanometallate material, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,831,006. Once a layered material is swollen, the material may be pillared by interposing a thermally stable substance, such as silica, between the spaced apart layers. The aforementioned U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,831,006 and 4,859,648 describe methods for pillaring the non-water swellable layered materials described therein and are incorporated herein by reference for definition of pillaring and pillared materials. Other patents teaching pillaring of layered materials and the pillared products include U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,216,188; 4,248,739; 4,176,090; and 4,367,163; and European Patent Application 205,711. The X-ray diffraction patterns of pillared layered materials can vary considerably, depending on the degree that swelling and pillaring disrupt the otherwise usually well-ordered layered microstructure. The regularity of the mtcrostructure in some pillared layered materials is so badly disrupted that only one peak in the low angle region on the X-ray diffraction pattern is observed, at a d-spacing corresponding to the interlayer repeat in the pillared material. Less disrupted materials may show several peaks in this region that are generally orders _of_this. fundamental repeat. X-ray reflections-from, the crystalline-structure-of-the layers are also sometimes observed. The pore size distribution in these pillared layered materials is narrower than those in amorphous and paracrystalline materials but broader than that in crystalline framework materials.<br>

The metathesis reaction of an unsaturated compound according to this aspect of the invention may be olefin metathesis (the latter being as explained in the background of the invention or as defined in http://www.ilpi.com/organomet/olmetathesis.htmn. in particular the ring-opening metathesis polymerisation of cyclic olefms, or acetylenic metathesis (the latter being as defined in http://www.ilpi.com/organomet/acmetathesis.html. a reaction in which all carbon-carbon triple bonds in a mixture of alkynes are cut and then rearranged in a statistical fashion, and involving a metalla-cyclobutadiene intermediate).<br>
	The.metathesis-reaction of- an unsaturated-compound- according-to-this -aspect-of the-<br>
invention may be conducted in a continuous, semi-continuous, or batch manner and may involve a liquid and/or gas recycling operation as desired. The manner or order of addition of the reactants, catalyst, and solvent are usually not critical, but a few preferred embodiments will be described hereinafter. In particular, the metathesis reaction may be carried out in a liquid reaction medium that contains a solvent for the active catalyst, preferably one in which the reactants, including catalyst, are substantially soluble at the reaction temperature.<br>
In a first embodiment of this aspect of the invention, the metathesis reaction is an olefin metathesis reaction for transforming a first olefin into at least one second olefin or into a linear olefin oligomer or polymer or into a cyclo-olefin. The invention thus relates to<br>
a method for performing an olefin metathesis reaction comprising contacting at least one first olefin with the catalytic component, optionally supported on a suitable carrier such as decribed hereinabove with reference to one previous aspect of the invention. The high activity of the metal complexes of this invention cause these compounds to coordinate with, and catalyze metathesis reactions between, many types of olefins. Exemplary olefin metathesis reactions enabled by the metal complexes of the present invention include, but are not limited to, RCM of acyclic dienes, cross metathesis reactions, de-polymerization of olefinic polymers and, more preferaby, ROMP of strained cyclic olefins. In particular, the catalytic components of this invention may catalyze ROMP of unsubstituted, mono-substituted and disubstituted strained mono-, bi- and polycyclic olefins with a ring size of at least 3, preferably 3 to 5, atoms; examples thereof include norbornene, cyclobutene, norbornadiene, cyclopentene, dicyclopentadiene, cycloheptene, cyclooctene, 7-oxanor-bornene, 7-oxanorbomadiene, cyclooctadiene, cyclododecene, mono- and disubstituted derivatives thereof, especially derivatives wherein the substituent may be C1-7 alkyl, cyano, diphenylphosphine, trimethylsilyl, methylaminomethyl, carboxylic acid or ester, trifluoromethyl, maleic ester, maleimido and the like, such as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,235,856, the content of which is incorporated herein in its entirety. The invention also contemplates ROMP of mixtures of two or more such monomers in any proportions. Further examples include water-soluble cyclic oleftns such as exo-N-(N',N',N'-trimethylammonio)ethyl-bicyclo[2.2.1] hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboximide chloride or exo-N-(Nl,N',N'-trimethylammonio)ethyl-bicyclo-7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboximide chloride. As is well known to the skilled person, olefins such as cyclohexenes which have little or no ring strain cannot be polymerized because there is no thermodynamic preference for polymer versus monomer.<br>
A ROMP reaction according to the invention may be carried out in an inert atmosphere for .instance by ,dissolving_a_catalytic amount .of the_ catalytic-component .in a .suitable solvent and then adding one or more of the said strained cyclic olefins, optionally dissolved in the same or another solvent, to the catalyst solution, preferably under agitation. Because a ROMP system is typically a living polymerisation process, two or more different strained cyclic olefins may be polymerised in subsequent steps for making diblock and triblock copolymers, thus permitting to tailor the properties of the resulting material, provided that the ratio of chain initiation and chain propagation is suitably selected. Solvents that may be used for performing ROMP include all kinds of organic solvents such as protic solvents, polar aprotic solvents and non-polar solvents, as well as supercritical solvents such as carbon dioxide (while performing ROMP under supercritical conditions), which are inert with respect to the strained cyclic olefin and the catalytic<br>
component under the polymerization conditions used. More specific examples of suitable organic solvents include, but are not limited to, ethers (e.g. dibutyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, ethylene glycol monomethyl or dimethyl ether, ethylene glycol monoethyl or diethyl ether, diethylene glycol diethyl ether or triethylene glycol dimethyl ether), halogenated hydrocarbons (e.g. methylene chloride, chloroform, 1,2-dichloroethane, 1,1,1-trichloroethane or 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane), carboxylic acid esters and lactones (e.g. ethyl acetate, methyl propionate, ethyl benzoate, 2-methoxyethyl acetate, y butyrolactone, δ-valerolactone or pivalolactone), carboxylic acid amides and lactams (e.g. N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-diethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, tetramethylurea, hexamethyl-phosphoric acid triamide, -butyrolactam, -caprolactam, N-methyl-pyrrolidone, N-acetylpyrrolidone or N-methylcaprolactam), sulfoxides (e.g. dimethyl sulfoxide), sulfones (e.g. dimethyl sulfone, diethyl sulfone, trimethylene sulfone or tetramethylene sulfone), aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g. petroleum ether, pentane, hexane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, benzene, chlorobenzene, o-dichlorobenzene, 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, nitrobenzene, toluene or xylene), and nitriles (e.g. acetonitrile, propionitrile, benzonitrile or phenylacetonitrile).<br>
The solubility of the polymer formed by ROMP will depend upon the choice of the strained cyclic olefin, the choice of the solvent and the molecular weight and concentration of the polymer obtained. When the strained cyclic olefin is potyunsaturated (e.g. dicyclopentadiene or norbomadiene), the polymer obtained may often be insoluble, whatever the solvent used. Polymerisation temperatures may range from about 0°C to about 120°C, preferably 20°C to 85°C, also depending upon the strained cyclic olefin and the solvent. The duration of polymerisation may be at least about 30 seconds, preferably at least about 1 minute, more preferably at least about 4 minutes, for instance about 30 minutes; the duration of polymerisation may be at most about 24 hours (although longer .times .may_be. used, .at the. expense, of economic-conditions), .preferably, at- most -about -4-hours, and more preferably at most about 2 hours. The molar ratio of the strained cyclic olefin to the metal of the catalytic component of the invention is not critical and, depending upon the strained cyclic olefin to be polymerised, the selected temperature and the selected duration of polymerisation, may be at least about 100, preferably at least 250, more preferably at least 500. The said molar ratio is usually, i.e. for most strained cyclic olefms, at most about 5,000,000, preferably at most 500,000 and more preferably at most 200,000 in order to achieve optimal conversion within the above recommended duration of polymerisation. Before the polymer formed solidifies in the reactor or mold or, at will, when a desired molecular weight of the polymer has been achieved (as may be controlled for instance by monitoring reactor temperature and/or reaction mixture viscosity), an oxidation<br>
inhibitor and/or a terminating or chain-transfer agent may be added to the reaction mixture, if needed. The choice of the terminating or chain-transfer agent used is not critical to this invention, provided that the said terminating agent reacts with the catalytic component and produces another species which is inactive, i.e. not able to further propagate the polymerisation reaction, under the prevailing conditions (e.g. temperature). For instance, adding a molar excess (with respect to the catalytic component) of a carbonyl compound to the reaction mixture is able to produced a metal oxo and an olefin (or polymer) capped with the former carbonyl functionality; the cleaved polymer can then be separated from the catalyst by precipitation with methanol. Another way of cleaving the polymer from the catalyst may be by the addition of a vinylalkylether. Alternatively, reaction with several equivalents of a chain-transfer agent such as a diene is another way of cleaving the polymer chain, which method does not deactivate the catalytic component, permitting additional monomer to be polymerised, however possibly at the risk of broadening molecular weight distribution.<br>
Because the metal complexes of this invention are stable in the presence of various functional groups, they may be used to catalyze metathesis of a wide variety of olefms under a wide variety of process conditions. In particular the olefinic compound to be converted by a metathesis reaction may include one or more, preferably at most two, functional atoms or groups, being for instance selected from the group consisting of ketone, aldehyde, ester (carboxylate), thioester, cyano, cyanato, epoxy, silyl, silyloxy, silanyl, siloxazanyl, boronato, boryl, stannyl, disulfide, carbonate, imine, carboxyl, amine, amide, carboxyl, isocyanate, thioisocyanate, carbodiimide, ether (preferably C1-20 alkoxy or aryloxy), thioether (preferably C1-20 thioalkoxy or thioaryloxy), nitro, nitroso, halogen (preferably chloro), ammonium, phosphonate, phosphoryl, phosphino, phosphanyl, C1-20 alkylsulfanyl, arylsulfanyl, C1-20 alkylsulfonyl, arylsulfonyl, C1-20 alkylsulfinyl, arylsulfinyl, sulfonamido- and sulfonate- (preferably- toluenesulfonate, methanesulfonate" or Irifluoro-methanesulfonate). The said olefin functional atom or group may be either part of a substituting group of the olefin or part of the carbon chain of the olefin.<br>
The metal complexes of this invention are also useful components for catalyzing, at relatively low temperatures (from about 20°C to 80°C), in the presence or absence of a solvent, the ring-closing metathesis of acyclic dienes such as, for instance, diallylic compounds (diallyl ether, diallyl thioether, diallyl phtalate, diallylamino compounds such as diallylamine, diallylamino phosphonates, diallyl glycine esters), 1,7-octadiene, substituted 1,6-heptadienes and the like.<br>
The metal complexes of this invention may also be used as catalytic components for the preparation of telechelic polymers, i.e. macromolecules with one or more reactive end-<br>
groups which are useful materials for chain extension processes, block copolymer synthesis, reaction injection moulding, and polymer network formation. An example thereof is hydroxyl-telechelic polybutadiene which may be obtained from 1,5-cycooctadiene, 1,4-diacetoxy-cis-2-butene and vinyl acetate. For most applications, a highly functionalized polymer, i.e. a polymer with at least two functional groups per chain, is required. The reaction scheme for a telechelic polymer synthesis via ring opening metathesis polymerisation is well known to those skilled in the art: in such a scheme, acyclic olefins act as chain-transfer agents in order to regulate the molecular weight of the telecheiic polymer produced. When α δw-bifunctional olefins are used as chain-transfer agents, truly bi-functional telechelic polymers can be synthesized.<br>
According to this aspect of the invention, olefin coupling may be performed by cross-metathesis comprising the step of contacting a first olefinic compound with the above-described catalytically active reaction product in the presence of a second olefin or functionalized olefin. The said first olefinic compound may be a diolefin or a cyclic mono-olefm with a ring size of at least 3 atoms, and the said metathesis cross-coupling is preferably performed under conditions suitable for transforming said cyclic mono-olefin into a linear olefin oligomer or polymer, or said diolefin into a mixture of a cyclic mono-olefin and an aliphatic alpha-olefin.<br>
Depending upon the selection of the starting substrates for the olefin metathesis reaction and the desired organic molecule to be produced, the olefin metathesis reaction can yield a very wide range of end-products including biologically active compounds. For instance the reaction may be for transforming a mixture of two dissimilar olefins, at least one of which is an alpha-olefin, selected from (i) cyclodienes containing from 5 to 12 carbon atoms and (ii) olefins having the formula:<br>
XHC=CH-(CH2)r-(CH=CH)a-(CHX')c-(CH2)rX"	(XIV),<br>
.into-an unsaturated-biologically-active-eompound-having-the formula:-<br>
H(CH2)2-(CH=CH)a-(CH2)m-(CH=CH)b-(CH2)pX"	(XV), wherein<br>
a is an integer from 0 to 2; b is selected from 1 and 2; c is selected from 0 and 1; m and p are such that the hydrocarbon chain in formula (V) contains from 10 to 18 carbon atoms; r and t are such that the combined total of carbon atoms in the hydrocarbon chains of the two dissimilar olefins of formula (XIV) is from 12 to 40; z is an integer from 1 to 10, and X, X' and X" are atoms or groups each independently selected from hydrogen, halogen, methyl, acetyl, -CHO and -OR,2, wherein R12 is selected from hydrogen and an alcohol protecting group selected from the group consisting of tetrahydropyranyl, tetrahydro-furanyl, tert-butyl, trityl, ethoxyethyl and SiR13R14R15 wherein R-,3, Ru and R15 are each independently selected from d-7 alky) groups and aryl groups.<br>
The said unsaturated biologically active compound having the formula (XV) may be a pheromone or pheromone precursor, an insecticide or a insecticide precursor, a pharmaceutically active compound 'or a pharmaceutical intermediate, a fragrance or a fragrance precursor. A few examples of the said unsaturated biologically active compounds include, but are not limited to, 1-chloro-5-decene, 8,10-dodecadienol, 3,8,10-dodecatrienol, 5-decenyl acetate, 11-tetradecenyiacetate, 1,5,9-tetradeca-triene and 7,11-hexadecadienyl acetate. The latter is a pheronome commercially available under the trade name Gossyplure and is useful in pest control by effectively disrupting the mating and reproductive cycles of specifically targeted insect species, and which may be produced from 1,5,9-tetradecatriene, the latter being obtainable from cyclooctadiene and 1-hexene according to the present invention.<br>
Ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) reactions using the catalytically active reaction product of the invention may proceed so quickly for olefinic monomers such as, but not limited to, dicyclopentadiene or oligomers thereof (i.e. Diels-Alder adducts formed with about 1 to 20 cyclopentadiene units), or mixtures thereof with strained monocyclic or pofycyclic fused olefins (e.g. as defined in U. S. Patent No. 6,235,856, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference), that polymerization control could become a problem in the absence of appropriate measures. This kind of problem is likely to occur during the molding of thermoset polymers wherein a liquid olefm monomer and a catalytic system are mixed and poured, cast or injected into a mold and wherein on completion of polymerization (i.e. " curing " of the article) the molded part is removed from the mold before any post cure processing that may be required, such as in the Reaction Injection Molding (hereinafter referred as " RIM ") technique. It is well known that the ability to control reaction rates, i.e. the pot life of the reaction mixture, becomes more important in the molding of larger parts using this technique. When using the . catalytically active reaction products-of this invention, extending the pot-life-of-the reaetion-mixture and/or controlling the rate of olefln metathesis polymerisation reaction may be effected in different ways, such as increasing the catalyst/olefin ratio and/or adding a polymerization retardant to the reaction mixture and/or selecting a particular mode of introduction of the olefin and the components of the catalytically active reaction product into the reactor (e.g. the mold). For instance, when the catalytically active reaction product of the invention results from modification of the multicoordinated metal complex by an activating metal or silicon compound alone (i.e. in the absence of a further reactant having the general formula RYH), rate control of the polymerisation reaction can be achieved by an improved embodiment comprising:<br>
(a)	a first step of contacting the optionally supported catalytic component of the<br>
invention with the olefin to be polymerised by ring-opening metathesis<br>
polymerization in a reactor at a first temperature at which said optionally<br>
supported catalytic component is substantially unreactive (inactive), and<br>
(b)	a second heat activation step of bringing the reactor temperature {e.g.<br>
heating the contents of said reactor) up to a second temperature above the<br>
said  first  temperature,   at  which   said   optionally  supported   catalytic<br>
component is active, until completion of polymerisation.<br>
In a more specific version of this improved embodiment, heat activation occurs in bursts rather than continuously, e.g. by repealing the sequence of steps (a) and (b).<br>
Within the said controlled polymerization method, it should be understood that the non-reactivity of the catalytic component in the first step depends not only upon the first temperature but also upon the nature of the olefin(s) used in said molding process (e.g. RIM technique) and/or upon the olefin/catalytic component ratio. Preferably the first temperature is about 20°C but, for specific olefins or specific olefin/catalytic component ratios, it may even be suitable to cool the reaction mixture below room temperature, e.g. down to about 0°C. The second temperature is preferably above 40°C and may be up to about 90°C.<br>
Alternatively, when the catalytically active reaction product of the invention results from modification of the multicoordinated metal complex by an activating metal or silicon compound in the presence of a further reactant (such as an organic acid or having the general formula RYH as decribed hereinabove), premature contact between said activating metal or silicon compound and said further reactant having the general formula RYH may result in premature formation of hydrogen halide which, if gaseous (e.g. hydrogen iodide, hydrogen bromide or hydrogen chloride respectively resulting from a metal .or silicon compound including-an iodine, bromine or-chlorine atem),-may- escape from the reaction mixture or at least result in unknown concentrations, rate control of the metathesis reaction can be achieved by an improved embodiment wherein the unsaturated compound (e.g. olefin or alkyne) to be submitted to metathesis is distributed in at least two flows before introduction into the reactor, said at least two flows comprising:<br>
- a first flow comprising a first portion of said unsaturated compound in admixture with the multicoordinated metal complex and the reactant having the general formula RYH, and optionally a solvent, and<br>
a second flow comprising a second portion of said unsaturated compound in admixture with the activating metal or silicon compound, and optionally a solvent.<br>
According to this improved embodiment of the process, the activating metal or silicon compound and the further reactant being an organic acid or having the general formula RYH may be kept separated until entrance into the reactor, thereby preventing premature formation of hydrogen halide. Also, since the multfcoordinated metal complex and the reactant being an organic acid or having the genera! formula RYH are usually non-reactive versus each other, this improved embodiment of the process ensures that all amounts of the activating metal or silicon compound and of the further reactant being an organic acid or having the general formula RYH are available for reaction and, consequently, that all in situ formed hydrogen halide is available for chemical modification of the multicoordinated metal complex. Within this improved embodiment of the process, each of the first flow and the second flow may additionally comprise suitable additives and carriers, as long as such additives and carriers do not interfere with the critical components of each flow, e.g. by desactivating the metal or silicon compound included in the second flow and/or the further reactant being an organic acid or having the genera! formula RYH included in the first flow. According to this improved embodiment of the process, the number of flows before introduction into the reactor is not limited to two, for instance a third flow for a third portion of the unsaturated compound (e.g. olefin or alkyne) to be submitted to metathesis, optionally together with the further reactant being an organic acid or having the general formula RYH and optionally with a solvent but without the multicoordinated metal complex, may also be present. According to this improved embodiment of the process, the respective proportions of the first flow, the second flow, and optionally the third flow, are not particularly restricted, as long as the recommended molar ratios between the activating metal or silicon compound, the further reactant being an organic acid or having the general formula RYH, the multicoordinated metal complex and unsaturated compound (e.g. olefin or alkyne) to be submitted to metathesis are met  and preferably as long as the solubility of each component of  the catalytic-system into said unsaturated compound is also met.<br>
ROMP using the catalytic components of this invention readily achieve linear or crosslinked polymers of the above-mentioned strained cyclic olefins, such as polynorbornenes and polydicyclopentadienes, with well controlled characteristics, i.e. average molecular weight and molecular weight distribution (polydispersity).<br>
Polymerisation, in particular when performed in a mold such as in the RiM technique, may also occur in the presence of one or more formulation auxiliaries, such as antistatics, antioxidants, ceramics, light stabilizers, plasticizers, dyes, pigments, fillers, reinforcing fibers, lubricants, adhesion promoters, viscosity-enhancing agents and demolding agents, all said auxilaries being well known in the art.<br><br>
Depending upon the specific reaction involved in this aspect of this invention, and especially when the said reaction is ROMP of strained cyclic olefins, reaction may also advantageously be performed under visible light or ultra-violet light irradiation, e.g. using a source of visible light or ultra-violet light being able to deliver sufficient energy to the reaction system.<br>

This example illustrates an embodiment of a ROMP process with activation of the Schiff base substituted ruthenium complex obtained in example 12 (acting as the catalyst to be activated) by both a chlorinated silane {CH3CI2SiH) and a phenol (2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-sec-butylphenol, commercially available from Schenectady International, Inc., Korea under the trade name ISONOX 132), wherein said silane activating compound and said phenol are kept separated until their entrance into the polymerisation reactor. . .. The operating procedure-was .as-follows: in- a first-14 mi-glass -vesse!T -1 -molar equivalent of the catalyst (dissolved in CH2CI2) was mixed with 5 ml dicyclopentadiene (hereinafter referred as DCPD), 60 molar equivalents ISONOX 132, and optionally 0.15 g of an additive. Said additive was either short glass fibres (2 mm length) in order to reinforce the resulting polymer {entry 4 in table 2) or an organic pigment (type: aromatic alcohol) commercially available under the trade name Disney Magic Artist from the company BtC (Clichy, France) in order to impart color to the resulting polymer (entries 2-3 and 5 in table 2). The color of said pigment is specified in table 2 below for each relevant experiment. Another 14 ml glass vessel was filled with 5 ml DCPD, 22 pi vinylnorbomene (acting as a chain transfer agent) and 30 molar equivalents CH3CI2SiH (from a 10 ml solution of 800 uL CH3CI2SiH in CH2CI2). The content of the second vessel was added to<br>
the first vessel and, at the moment of addition, time measurement was started. The total volume of DCPD (10 ml) corresponds to 30,000 molar equivalents of the monomer with respect to the catalyst.<br>
Reaction was allowed to proceed for a certain time (expressed in minutes in table 2 below), after which temperature quickly decreases. The polymerisation reaction was extremely exothermic, possibly involving foaming of the mixture, and the maximum temperature Tmax (expressed in "C in table 2 below) was duly recorded by means of a thermocouple. In a few embodiments of this experimental set-up, dynamic mechanical analysis (hereinafter referred as DMA) was performed on the resulting polydicyclo-pentadiene in order to assess its glass transition temperature Tg. Results of DMA show that Tmax is in good accordance (statistically significantly) with Tg.<br>
The following table 2 indicates the maximum temperature T^ obtained while changing the type of additive.<br>

(Table Removed)<br>
The data presented in table 2 show that, under the above stated experimental conditions, polydicyclopentadiene with a glass transition temperature Tg above 158 °C can reproducibly be obtained within about 4 to 9 minutes according to this invention, and that said high TQ polymer may be reinforced or coloured at will. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it may be postulated that the TB increase observed for entries 2-3 and 5 with respect to that of entry 1 wfthout additive may be due to the chemical constitution of the organic pigments which makes them able to act as a further reactant with the chlorinated silane activating compound.<br>
EXAMPLE 18 - ring opening polymerisation of dicyclopentadiene with activation of a Schiff base ruthenium complex<br>
The procedure of example 17 was repeated, except that 2.6-di-tert-butyl-4-sec-butylphenol was replaced with 3,5-dimetnylphenol, i.e. a less sterically hindered phenol, and no additive was added in any experiment, and (only in the experimental entry 3 of table 3) the experimental scale was increased by bringing the total DCPD volume to 90 ml instead of 10 ml.<br>
