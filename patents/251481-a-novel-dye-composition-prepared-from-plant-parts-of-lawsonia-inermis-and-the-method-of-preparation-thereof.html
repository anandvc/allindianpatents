				<td>Field of the Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a dye composition prepared from Lawsonia inermis for staining proteins on a gel. The present invention also provides a method for preparing the said dye composition. The present invention further provides a method for conducting sodium-dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) assay using the said dye.<br>
Background and Prior Art:<br>
There are several methods which have been developed in the past for separating proteins according to their size. One of the most commonly used methods for separating the proteins is the SDS-PAGE assay. The general set up of the apparatus for performing the SDS-PAGE assay is illustrated in Figure 1. The purpose of SDS-PAGE assay is to separate proteins according to their size, and no other physical feature.<br>
Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS)<br>
SDS is used to denature all proteins to the same linear shape. SDS is a detergent (soap) that can not only dissolve hydrophobic molecules but also has a negative charge (sulphate) attached to it. Therefore, if a cell is incubated with SDS, the membranes will be dissolved, all the proteins will be soluablized by the detergent, plus all the proteins will be covered with many negative charges. This is known as SDS "wrapping around" the polypeptide backbone. SDS binds to proteins fairly specifically in a mass ratio of 1.4:1. The effect of treating the sample solution containing protein is illustrated in Figure 2.<br>
Poly Acrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (PAGE)<br>
If the proteins are denatured and put into an electric field, they will all move towards the positive pole at the same rate, with no separation by size. So we need to put the proteins into an environment that will allow different sized proteins to move at different rates.<br>
The velocity of a charged particle moving in an electric field is directly proportional to the field strength and the charge on the molecule and is inversely proportional to the size of the molecule and the viscosity of the medium. Adding a gel with sieving properties<br><br>
(that is a gel where the resistance to the motion of a particle increases with particle size) increases the differences in mobility between proteins of different molecular weights. This is the basis of separation. The environment of choice is polyacrylamide, which is a polymer of acrylamide monomers. The structure of the polyacrylamide gel is illustrated in figure 3.<br>
Thus, in the SDS-PAGE assay, the sample protein which is to be separated is first denatured using SDS and then loaded on the gel and to the gel electric field is applied thereby facilitating separation of the protein molecules.<br>
In order to facilitate viewing of the proteins thus separated, the gel is stained with a dye or a stain. The stain contained in the gel binds with the denatured protein and moves along with the same thereby facilitating viewing of the separation of the protein.<br>
Several procedures are now available for staining the proteins. Also, several different types of stains are available which can be used for staining the protein. Some of the commonly used stains include Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, Amido Black and Silver stain.<br>
United States Patent no. 6,057,160 discloses a rapid and simple method for making a hydrophobically associated, Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) dye/protein complex comprising CBB and a protein, and a method for detecting analytes using the CBB dye/protein complex. Korean patents no. 445939 describes the use of SeePico™ CBB Stain Kit. The patent is pending in other countries (including U.S.A, Japan, E.U., China, Australia).The Kit makes use of the newly developed technique (patent pending) using Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 (CBB-G250) dye for protein staining in sodium-dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). This innovative kit allows protein bands or spots to be viewed with hypersensitivity (1ng or less of protein bands can be detected) from 30 minutes.<br>
The Coomassie dye (Brilliant blue G250) whose structure is shown in figure 4, binds to protein molecules in acid pH by two means. The triphenylmethane group binds to nonpolar structures in proteins, and the anion sulfonate groups interact with protein<br><br>
cationic side chains (e.g., arginine and lysine side chains) in acid pH. The color change produced when the dye binds to proteins provides a measure of total protein, which is quite sensitive in the case of albumin and certain globular proteins.<br>
The Coomassie dye-binding assay, or Bradford assay, also responds to some interfering substances which are generally unknown unless specifically tested for. Nevertheless, because of its apparent simplicity and sensitivity towards many proteins, the Bradford assay is popular and widely used.<br>
The salient features of the Coomassie dye-binding assay are:<br>
•	It develops intensely colored complexes with proteins<br>
•	It can determine as little as 0.5 µg/cm2 of protein present in a gel matrix<br>
•	Anion of Coomassie Brilliant Blue formed in the acidic staining medium combines with the protonated amino groups of proteins by electrostatic interaction;<br>
•	resulting complex is reversible under the proper conditions<br>
Although the Coomassie dye-binding assay is widely used, it has got severe safety related disadvantages. The following is a quote from the Material safety data sheet of national diagnostics with regard to coomassie brilliant blue R-250:<br>
"IT MAY BE HARMFUL IF SWALLOWED OR INHALED. MAY CAUSE IRRITATION TO SKIN AND EYES. THE TOXICOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF THIS SUBSTANCE HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY INVESTIGATED."<br>
Some of the potential health risks of using coomassie brilliant blue R-250 include:<br>
o   Inhalation: Causes irritation to the respiratory tract.<br>
o   Ingestion: No information found, but compound should be handled as a potential<br>
health hazard. May cause irritation to the digestive tract. o   Skin: May cause irritation, redness and pain. o   Eyes: May cause irritation, redness and pain.<br><br>
In addition to the above mentioned safety related disadvantages, some of the other disadvantages include:<br>
•	the price of the dye is high;<br>
•	it is not readily available at all places. It has to be procured from stores and cannot be prepared at home;<br>
•	the time taken for de-staining the gel is very long. It takes about 15 hours to de-stain the gel.<br>
In view of the above disadvantages, it is required to provide an alternative dye or stain which is at least equivalent, if not better than the commonly available dyes including the Coomassie dye in terms of sensitivity and overcomes at least one of the disadvantages described above.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Lawsonia inermis commonly known as Henna, grows in clusters of small, intensely fragrant flowers. Sometimes the flowers are pink or red, but usually they are white. Three species of the Lawsonia plant are used as henna: Inermis, Alba and Spinoza. Belongs to family lythraceae<br>
Modern scientists have many beneficial properties in Henna. In fact, the actual Henna plant is sometimes called the "Magic Plant" because it has great healing effects. It contains ingredients to be antibacterial, anti-fungal, and anti-hemorrhagic. Henna is useful is healing athlete's foot, fungal skin infections, headaches, burning of the soles and palms, and local inflammation. The leaves and seeds of the plant possess medicinal properties. They both act as cooling agents for the head and body.<br>
Henna will only grow where the minimum temperature is above 50° F or 11° C. Henna is a small tree and has to grow for 5 years to mature and produce leaves with useful levels of tannin. Therefore, for henna to grow outdoors unsheltered, the temperature must stay above 50° F for many years. Henna grows better in arid regions than wet regions. Henna produces higher levels of tannins where the maximum temperature is very high. Henna produces higher levels of tannins in very arid climates than in moist climates. The hottest, driest regions have henna with the highest levels of tannin that make the darkest stains. Henna from these areas can be dried, powdered, and sold. If henna is from a moist region, the henna is good for use fresh, but is not good for use dried and powdered, because of the lower tannin levels.<br>
Constituents of henna<br>
	Hennatonic acid (A Natural protein)<br>
	Lawsone (A natural pigment)<br>
	Mannitol<br><br>
	Volatile Oil<br>
	Fats<br>
	Resin<br>
Staining action of henna on stratum corneum<br>
Skin is our body's largest organ. It keeps our body's moisture inside our body so we don't die of dehydration. The stratum corneum is the outermost membrane of our skin. Our skin also keeps injurious exogenous agents outside the body. The stratum corneum is made of keratin, the same protein that makes hair, fingernails, horn, hooves and turtle shells. On some parts of our body, the stratum corneum is very thick, and on other parts it is thin. The thickest skin is on our heels, where the stratum corneum averages 86 layers of cells.<br>
Every day our body grows new layer of skin cells below the surface of the skin. These skin cells are interlocked and rise upward in columns, being pushed up by the new cells underneath. As they rise in this column, they gradually die, dry out and become "corneated". Thus, instead of being moist, soft and flexible, they get stiff and dry. When they emerge at the surface of skin, they are very dead, very dry, and getting loose. Dry and flaky skin is an indication of heavy shedding of corneated cells from Stratum Corneum.<br>
Henna has a tannin dye molecule, lawsone, which is a natural pigment or in other words the dye molecules. It is believed that lawsone is small enough to penetrate a skin cell and imparts the color. If we put henna paste on skin, the dye molecules will penetrate down the columns of skin cells. They don't spread out, as ink would on blotter paper. On the other hand, they go straight down as ink would on corrugated cardboard. That is why the pattern stays clear and in place till the last day of exfoliation.<br>
When the henna pattern disappears, the henna stained cells have emerged at the outside of the skin and exfoliated. Tattooed cells are deeper in the skin, and do not exfoliate. To tattoo skin, pigment is placed under the Stratum Corneum into the basal and spinous<br><br>
layers. That is why tattoos bleed and hurt. Tattoo pigment is going into living tissue. Henna does not hurt because it is staining dead cells, and those cells exfoliate.<br>
Henna releases its dye content in acidic conditions. That means we can get the dye content by providing some acid to the pure henna. Commonly used acid is citric acid, i.e., is lemon. Henna releases its dye content at a pH of 5.5.<br>
On oxidation the stain gets darker. Air oxidizes the henna stain. We can also force oxidation by putting something alkaline on the surface of skin. Sweat is a safe alkaline. In place of sweat, limestone can also be used to provide alkaline conditions. Henna stains on skin and hair darken during the first 48 hours after paste removal. If keratin is saturated with lawsone, under certain conditions the darkening can be dramatic. If silk is stained with henna, and the cloth is heated by ironing, the stain will become dark brown. If palm or sole skin is saturated with henna, steam will darken the henna to dark brown or near black. If a henna-stained palm is treated with dilute ammonia or another alkaline, the stain will darken to brown-black or greenish black.<br>
Chemically, the molecule of lawsone, whose structure is illustrated in figure 5, is 2-hydroxy-l,4-naphthoquinone. Industrial classifications also describe lawsone as Natural Orange 6 and C.I. 75480. Lawsone show its congeniality to naphthalene. In lawsone, two oxygen atoms are attached to the naphthalene carbons at positions 1 and 4 to form 1,4-naphoquinone and a hydroxyl group is present at position 2. Its molecule contains 10 carbons, 6 hydrogens and 3 oxygens (C10H6O3), giving a total molecular weight of 174.16 atomic units of mass. Pure lawsone is an orange powder, insoluble in water, with a melting point higher than 192°C and optical absorption maximum of 452 nm.<br>
As the structure of lawsome is not similar to the structure of Coomassie dye, there exists no reason for a person skilled in the art to presume that lawsome can be used as a replacement of Coomassie dye. Thus, the complete tests of finding a substitute for Coomassie dye were conducted without any clue from any literature guidance. The details of the tests conducted are outlined here below. It should however, be understood<br><br>
that the following paragraphs are provided merely to enable a person skilled in the art to better understand the invention and nothing contained in the following sections is intended to limit the scope of the invention in any manner. The scope of the claims is intended to be limited by only the claims and their equivalent.<br>

(c)	Preparation of Running buffer stock:<br>
To about 3 x 202 g Tris-OH add 10 x 288 g Glycine and 2 x 100 g SDS. To the mixture thus obtained add about 20 liter of distilled water on carboy. The pH need not be adjusted as the pH can be between 8.3 to 8.7. In order to check the pH, preferably use pH paper instead of using pH meter.<br><br>
d)        Preparation of Lower gel buffer, LGB:<br>
To about 45.43 g Tris base add 5.75 ml concentrated HC1. If necessary, adjust the pH to 8.8. Add to the mixture thus obtained 1 g SDS and about 250 ml of distilled water.<br>
(e)	Preparation of Upper gel buffer, UGB:<br>
To 7.58 g Tris base add about 4.8 ml of concentrated HC1. If necessary, adjust the pH value of the mixture to about 6.8. Add about 0.5 g SDS and 125 ml of distilled water.<br>
(f)	Preparation of Ammonium persulfate:<br>
Add about 100 mg of Ammonium persulfate per ml distilled H2O.<br>
(g)	Preparation of Coomassie blue stain and fixative:<br>
To about 500 ml of methanol add 400 ml distilled H2O and 100 ml glacial acetic acid. To the above mixture add 1 g Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The stain may be reused multiple times if the staining is too light or alternatively it can be discarded. In an alternate method which does not require de-staining, add about 5 ml of stain to about 300 ml of destain and place gel overnight and allow it to get dried for use the next morning.<br>
(h)       Preparation of Destainer:<br>
To about 300 ml of methanol add 2.49 liter of distilled H2O and 210 ml glacial acetic acid. A small piece of foam sponge added speeds up de-staining and conserves de-stain solution.<br>
Gel preparation data<br>
Two glass plates, washed with ethanol (one notched) were placed on each other, separated by two separators known as spacers. Plates were joined by tape. Leakage was checked by pouring water in between two plates. Before pouring lower gel buffer, plug gel was prepared. Decanted water and poured plug gel .After polymerization of plug gel, lower gel (also called as separating gel) was poured. For the various experiments performed, 10% lower gel was used. Here we waited for the polymerization of the gel. pH of the lower gel is about 8.8. After polymerization of lower gel, upper gel (also called as stacking gel) was added. The pH of stacking gel is 6.8. After pouring upper gel; a comb is placed for the formation of wells. After polymerization, comb was removed and wells were rinsed with water. Remove the tape from bottom side so as to make the circuit<br><br>
complete. The gel is now ready for being placed on the plate on electrophorosis apparatus containing running buffer in upper and lower reservoirs. The compositions of the plug-in gel, the lower gel and the upper gel are provided in table 1, table 2 and table 3 respectively.<br>
Table 1: Composition of Plug-in Gel<br>
Table 2: Composition of Lower Gel<br>
Table 3: Composition of upper Gel<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Performing the SDS-PAGE Assay:<br>
Once the gel is ready, preheated sample buffer containing samples and selectable marker, whose molecular weight was known is loaded in the well. After this electric field was applied. Proteins having negative charge move towards positive electrode at 100V and bands were formed. These bands were visible after staining and destaining of the gel with different dyes.<br>
The velocity of a charged particle moving in an electric field is directly proportional to the field strength and the charge on the molecule and is inversely proportional to the size of the molecule and the viscosity of the medium. Adding a gel with sieving properties (that is a gel where the resistance to the motion of a particle increases with particle size) increases the differences in mobility between proteins of different molecular weights. This is the basis of separation.<br>
A number of experiments were performed to evaluate different types of dye compositions containing henna for their suitability for the SDS-PAGE assay. Details of some of the types of the types of dye compositions containing henna leaves which were prepared, the method for preparing the dye compositions and the tests conducted to determine their suitability for the SDS-PAGE assay are outlined in the following example. Wherever possible, the Applicants have tried to provide comparative data with reference to Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 dye.<br>

o   7 µl serum in 15 µl sample buffer.<br>
o   3 µl serum in 15 µl sample buffer.<br>
o    1 µl serum in 15 µl sample buffer.<br>
o   0.5 |o.l serum in 15µl sample buffer.<br>
o   4 µ1 of 20 times diluted serum sample in 15 µl of sample buffer.<br>
o    1 µl of 20 times diluted serum sample in 15 µl of sample buffer.<br>
o    15 µ1 of Protein molecular weight markers in 15 µl of sample buffer.<br>
All the samples were heated at 60°C-70°C.<br>
Loading: Samples were loaded in each well of the plate as shown in figures 24 (a) and 24 (b).<br>
Staining: Gel was put in dye as shown in the figure. Staining time for henna dye is 45 -50 minutes and for coomassie dye is 15-20 minutes.<br>
Henna stained gel was put in ammonia for 5 minutes before and after de-staining.<br>

Bands with 2.5 ug protein sample are visible both in henna and alta stained gels. But best results were with coomassie dye. One band of marker is visible in case of henna dye. In alta visibility of markers is better with best results in coomassie. Although results with coomassie dye seem better but destaining time taken in case of henna was very less. At higher protein content quality of bands with henna dye is better. Use of ammonia darkens the henna color.<br>
Experiment 23: Comparison of Dye 6 with Dye 5 Procedure: <br>
Gel plates were prepared from the standard procedure as mentioned above. The concentration of lower gel was kept at 10%.<br>
Sample preparation: Protein sample used for this experiment was serum.<br>
o   7 µl serum in 15 µl sample buffer.<br>
o   3 µl serum in 15 µl sample buffer.<br>
o    1 µl serum in 15 µl sample buffer.<br>
o   0.5 ul serum in 15 µl sample buffer.<br>
o   4 µl of 20 times diluted serum sample in 15 µl of sample buffer.<br>
o    1 µl of 20 times diluted serum sample in 15 µl of sample buffer.<br>
o    15 µl of Protein molecular weight markers in 15 µl of sample buffer.<br>
All the samples were heated at 60°C-70°C.<br>
Loading: Samples were loaded in each well of the plate as shown in figure 26.<br>
Staining: Two different gels were dyed, a first gel using Dye 6 and a second gel with Dye 5. Staining time for Dye 6 was 45 - 50 minutes at 40°C - 45°C and for Dye 5 was 45 to 50 minutes at 40°C - 45°C.<br>
Destaining: The gel stained with Dye 6 was put in 7% acetic acid at 60°C - 65°C for one and a half to two hours. The gel stained with Dye 5 was also destained for the same time under the identical conditions.<br>
Results: As shown in figure 26 (b), for Dye 6 the normal dye bands were good and 2.5 ug of protein sample was also visible after two hours of staining. In case of Dye 5 the visibility of bands was poor. It was not able to discriminate between the band and the other place. The complete gel was dark in color. However, when the gel dyed with Dye 5 was further de-stained, for three to four hours, the bands were visible. Color of bands with Dye 6 was yellowish brown while with Dye 5 was blackish brown. It can therefore be concluded that the amount of time period required for staining the gel should be lesser. If the gel is stained with Dye 5 for shorter period of time period, it would not only be possible to visualize the bands but also, the bands thus visualized would be substantially better in quality than what would be attained when Dye 6 is used.<br>
Experiment 24: Comparison of Dye 5 with Dye 6 with different staining and<br>
destaining conditions.<br>
Procedure: Gel plates were prepared from the standard procedure as mentioned previously. The concentration of lower gel was kept at 10%.<br>

o    1 µl of 20 times diluted serum sample in 15 µl of sample buffer.<br>
o    15 µl of Protein molecular weight markers in 15 µl of sample buffer.<br>
All the samples were heated at 60°C-70°C.<br>
Loading: Samples were loaded in each well of the plate as shown in figure 27 (a).<br>
