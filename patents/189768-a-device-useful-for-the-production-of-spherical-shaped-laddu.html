				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a device useful for the production of spherical shaped "Laddu"<br>
The device particularly produces products of definite size, weight and bulk density out of granular, pasty and semi-solid food materials.<br>
A number of traditional foods are formed into spherical shapes before they are processed and consumed, some examples being, Laddus from Boondi mix, Besan ,Soji, Ragimuddi (dough) products.<br>
The sweets like Laddu and other sweet products that are presently prepared in Indian temples are generally of spherical shape and they have become very popular throughout the Country. For instance, boondi Laddus are regularly prepared by thousands of sweet meat shops and many religious institutions such as The Tirupathi Tirumala Devastanam (TTD) every day by manual operation using bare hands. Very little effort has gone into the development of such Gadgets and machinery for the production of such spherical foods for mass consumption in a hygienic manner.<br>
The present practice adopted for production of Laddus using hands has the following drawbacks :<br>
1.	The production rate is very low.<br>
2.	The operation is labour intensive.<br><br>
3 The manual drudgery is very high.<br>
4	Repeaied hand apphcaiion in forming the ball results in unhygienic product.<br>
5.Consislancy m shape,  size,  weight and production rate is not assured<br>
or guaranteed. 6        Higher teinperature ol the raw material mix does not permit the laddu maker<br>
to Vv'ork continuously.<br>
The main object of the present invention, is to provide a device useful for forming spherical shaped food items such as Laddu and like products.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a shnple hand operated device which can be conveniently used for fonning Laddu, Ragimudde and similar spherical shaped foods in a hygienic condition without using human hands for forming.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a device to produce spherical shaped toods having uniform consistancy in shape, size and bulk density in the entire batch of production.<br>
Still another objecthe of the present invention is to provide a device to increase the production rate and to form spherical shaped products even when the foods are   at higher temperatures where human hands cannot be used.<br>
In the drawings accompanying this specification,<br>
Fig.1 represents the Front Elevation of the device and<br>
Fig.2 represents the Plan of the device of the present invention.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a device useful for the production of spherical shaped "Laddu" such as herein described, which comprises a fixed hemispherical hollow die-cup (2) and a movable hemispherical hollow die-cup (3), the said die cups (2&amp;3) being movably fixed in a hollow cylindrical rotatble channel (1) in such a manner so that the hollow concave surfaces of the said diecups face each other, the said fixed die-cup (2) being provided at the center of its convex side with a spring actuated spindle ejector (5), the said movable die-cup (3) being connected at its convex side with means of a hand lever (4) for enabling it to move and form a sphere with the said fixed die-cup (2), the said cylindrical rotatable channel (1) being fitted onto a stand (10) in such a manner so as to allow tilting/rotation of the said assembly by means of a ball lever (6) and stopper (7).<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the rotatable cylindrical channel may be provided with guide plate (9).<br>
In another embodiment, the device of the present invention may be provided with a collecting tray (8) at the base of stand (10).<br>
Au cmbodimont of the device of the present invention is illustrated in ligures 1&amp;2 accompanying this specification. A iiand operated gadget for the produclion of spherical shapes useful for varicty of food products, parlicularly for Laddu forming comprises of a cylindrical pipe (1) cut opened ai the middle for the purpopse of feeding the ingredient mix, m which a stationary hemispherical die-cup (2) and a movable hemispherical die-cup (3) are placed such that the hollow concave surfaces face each other, a hand lever (4) for inanual application of compressive force with mechanical advantage, spring actuated spindle (5) for ejection of the formed ball from the die-cup (2) if necessary, a ball lever (6) for tilting the cylindrical pipe (1) by an angle of about 100 degree, with the help of a stopper (7), to eject out the formed ball on to the collecting tray (8), with the help of guide plate (9). all suitably mounted on a base plate with stand (10).<br>
The device in brief consists of components viz. a cylindrical pipe (1), a stationary hemispherical die-cup (2), movable hemispherical die-cup (.S), hand lever (4), spring actuated spindle (5) ball lever (6), stopper (7), collecting tray (8), guide plate (9) and base plate with stand (10).<br>
This invention is described in detail in the following examples which are provided by way of illustrations only and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
Example-1<br>
150 gms of loose grannular boondi mix with all ingredients at a forming temperature (50 degree C) is fed into the cut opened portion of the cylindrical pipe (1) Figure of 1&amp;2, which is placed in horizantal position. The hand lever (4) is then operated to compress the mix, till the movable hemispherical die-cup (3) touches the stationary hemispherical die-cup (2). The hand lever (4) is again operated in the reverse direction to bring it back to its initial position. The laddu so formed and left behind in the cylindrical pipe (1) is brought to the centre of the cylindrical pipe by pressing the spring actuated spindle (5) and simultaneously the ball lever (6) is operated to rotate cylindrical pipe (1). by 100 degrees, to eject out the laddu on to the collecting tray (8). Thereafter the cylindrical pipe (1) is brought back to its eariier horizantal position by operating the ball lever (6). The device is ready for the next cycle of operation. Example - 2.<br>
175 gms of hot pasty dough of ragi at a forming temperature (70 degree C) is fed into the cut opened portion of the cylindrical pipe (1) Figure of 1&amp;2, which is placed in horizantal position. The hand lever (4) is then operated to compress the dough, till the movable hemispherical die-cup (3) touches the stationary hemispherical die-cup (2). The hand lever (4) is again operated in the everse direction to bring    it back to its initial position. The "ragi mudde(dough)" so<br>
formed and left behind in the cylindrical pipe (1 ) is brought to the centre of the cylindrical pipe by pressnig the spring acnuned spindle (5) nnd simnhaneously the ball lever (6) is operated to rotate cylindrical pipe (1) by 100 degrecy to ejccl out the ragimudde on to the collecting tray (8). Thecafter the cylindrical pipe (1 ) is brought back to its earlier horizantal position by operating the ball iever (6), 'the dcv'icc is ready for the next cycle of operation.<br>
The device of the present invention can also be used convenienth- for forming spherical products such as laddus from 'basen", 'soji' and other food hems.<br>
By suitably selecting the materials of construction for the gadget, such as non-stick material coated stainless steels etc., the problems of stickiness, if an}" could be avoided.<br>
The advantages of the device of the present invention are;<br>
1.	Increased productivity.<br>
2.	The use of hands and human contact on ingredient raw material in forming the ball is totally eliminated thereby obtaining clean and hygienic products.<br>
3       Allows use of very hot(100 - 150 degree C) raw, materials foroming.<br>
The manual forming using hands is not safe as it may cause scalding/burns. 4.       Uniform consistancy in shape and size of the Laddu and similar  foods<br>
achieved. 5       Simple and easy to operate. 6.       Trouble free, easy to maintain and does not require  electric power.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
