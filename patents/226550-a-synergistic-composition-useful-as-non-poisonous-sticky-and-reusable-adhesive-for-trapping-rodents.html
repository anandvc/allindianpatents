				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention, relates to a composition for the preparation of non-poisonous adhesive for making traps to trap house rats. The traps made from this glue are non-poisonous, sticky and disposable ones. The main principle in such a trap is the use of highly viscous and sticky polymer based on acrylic co-polymers prepared by solution polymerisation, and also using natural rubber and other tackifying resins. They may also contain compositions based on polybutenes which are obtained as bye products of petroleum industry. The glue is brushed or applied by knife in case of 100% solid adhesion based on polybutenes on a surface made out of a heavy card board or high density polyethelene or even metal plates and when it is placed on the rodent runways, the moving rodent gets stuck upon these glues. The principle in this technology is to catch the rats at one touch.<br>
Since the pre-requisite for usage of these glue traps is safety from dust or anyother exotic material would retard the efficiency of the glue i.e., these traps are not to be kept in the field for visualising the capability of the field rodent. However, when kept in orchards, vegetable fields, squirrels usually avoid them and the traps become ineffective due to dust leaves and other non target insects be inadvertently trapped. Therefore, these traps are evaluated indoor residential premises and godowns.<br>
Pest Management is essentially to apply integrated approach according to various biotic and aboitic factors like other pest control operations, rodents control can also be achieved by physical, mechanical, biological and chemical methods. No single method of rodent control fits in all the situations, even under ideal conditions. The results obtained from most of these methods are variable due to<br><br>
several reasons. It may sometimes be necessary to use several approaches to control them. From the point of view of population reductions of the rodents, it makes no difference if a rat is killed by a trap, a poison or a predator. In all these basic approaches for protecting stored products could be accomplished. The decisions about the methods to be applied should be made on the basis of its effectiveness, cost practicability, potential side effects and finally the acceptability in the culture where it is used.<br>
The use of rodent traps in the houses, stores, godowns and fields is an age old practice in our. country. Some commonly used traps are based on two principles: (a)killing traps or snap traps, (b)trapping type or life traps. These traps may prove quite effective in managing the rodent but their repeated use may poise some problems. The frequent use of some traps for several days makes them ineffective, because of development of trap shyness behaviour in rodents. Smaller traps are often taken away by predatory animals or damaged by them making the trapping program uneconomical but all these factors cannot be kept in mind by public who are the end users of the traps. Therefore, there is a need to develop a trap which is most simple, easy to handle and possess high trapping success and non hazardous to non-target species. Therefore, all over the world, the glue coated traps are becomming more popular for the pest mangement. Therefore, varieties of high tack glue compositions are made in order to trap the rodents and the composition of the glue vary on the basis of the weight of the rodent.<br>
The principle novel feature of the adhesive composition of the present invention is that the high tack acrylic co-polymers are prepared by solution polymerisation especially for trapping those rodents which are of light weight in the order of 25 -<br><br>
100 g. Whereas, for the rats which are of 100 g - 500 g weight, the glue composition described in the present investigation depends on the 100Â°o solid adhesive compositions based on polybutenes and other natural resins obtained from the plant origin such as bum olibanum resinoid. The adhesive application on the traps depend upon the type of glue used. For solution polymers of acrylic copolymers, the brush coating method is used. But the adhesive compositions based on 100% solids, as they are very highly viscous with very high tack knife coating method is used. The weight of the trap also depends upon the weight of the rodent to be trapped. For light weight rodents cardboard or high density polyethelene traps are prepared and for heavy weight rodents even aluminium sheet traps are used.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a composition useful as nonpoisonous sticky adhesive for trapping rodents which comprises 0.33 to 100 wt. % polymer. 0 to 37 wt.% tackyrying resins, 0 to 10 wt.% plasticizer, 0 to 2 wt.% solvent. 0 to 2 wt.% filler.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the polymer used may be us'ch as natural rubber, polyacrylate, polybutene of molecular weight in the range of 960 to 3000.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention the tackyiying resin used may be such as phenolic resin, gum olibinum resinoid and plasticizer used may be usch as parrafin oil.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the tiller used may be such as zinc oxide, magnesium oxide.<br>
The solvent used may be usch as toluene, benzene, hexane and their combinations.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of nonpoisonous sticky adhesive and the traps made there for trapping house rats. There are three varieties of nonpoisonous sticky' adhesives prepared in this invention.<br>
All the raw materials used may be of commercial grade.<br>
The process of invention is described here under:<br>
Acrylicesters such as butyl acrylate and ethylhexyl acrylates were copolymerised by solution polymerisation method using benzoyl peroxide as initiator at 70 - 90Â°C. In another variety of adhesive natural rubber was milled and then dissolved in toluene. Seperately gum olibinum resinoid obtained from the extraction of gum olibinum resin was mixed with a phenolic resin having a melting point of 130Â°C and then dissolved in toluene. ; This is the main tackifying resin solution. Seperately paraffin oil was dissolved in toluene and all the solutions were mixed so as to get an adhesive having 30% solids. Another variety of nonpoisonous sticky adhesive was prepared by compounding gum olibinum resinoid with poKbutene having a molecular weight range of 960 - 3000 till a uniform adhesive is obtained.<br>
The sticky traps were prepared using a high density- polyethylene tough sheets of 15 x25 cm. with a provision for folding at the centre.. The thickness of the high density polyethelene board is of 0.2 cm. The weight of the board is about 80 g before applying the adhesive material. The glue material (15 g) was applied on one side preferably by a knife. This investigation is confined to house rats upto a weight of 500 g. In order to test the efficacy of the adhesive to trap the rats, initially the captured rats were aneasthesised with diethyl ether and placed on the giue trap, only fore and hind legs were kept on the glue trap and the remaining body is kept free. The rat after coming back to senses, it starts struggling for liberation. The efficacv of the adhesive is auaaed as tar as it does not set free.<br><br>
To illustrate the efficacy of the adhesive,	various compositions were prepared.<br>
The adhesive  prepared  by the  process	described  above  has  the  following<br>
components:<br>
a)      Poly butyl acrylate	]<br>
] Polymers 33-100%'<br>

b)	Poly ehtyl hexylacrylate<br>
c)	Natural rubber	]<br>
d)	Poly butene (molecular weight 2000 - 3000)]<br>
] Tackifying resins ] 0-37%<br>
e)	Phenolic resin  MP 130Â°C<br>
f)	Gum olibinum resinoid<br>
0-10%	1 solids<br>
0-2%<br>
0-2 times the weight of total solids<br>
g)	Paraffin oil (Plasticiser)<br>
h)	Zinc Oxide (Filler)<br>
i)	Toluene<br>
The following examples are given in the way of illustrations and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of present invention.<br>
EXAMPLE -1<br>
In a stainless steel kettle, toluene (1.2 Its.) was added. To this, a mixture of butyl acrylate (500 g) and ethyl hexyl acryiate (500g) were added gradually over a period of 15 min. under stirring. To this mixture, benzol peroxide (5g) was added as initiator. The contents of the reaction kettle were heated to reflux temperature 80 - 85Â°C for a period of 6 hours. The product was cooled and discharged. It has a viscocity of 1800 CPS. The adhesive was applied on High Density- Polyethylene traps by brush (2 coats) after drying the adhesive layer, the traps were tested for its efficacy by placing them in rice godovvns. These traps were found to be effective for trapping rats of 100 -150 g weight.<br>
EXAMPLE - II<br>
In a stainless steel vertical churner masticated natural rubber (370g) were dissolved in toluene (2400ml). In a separate container gum olibinum resinoid (45Qg) phenolic resin (melting point 130Â°C) (600g) were dissolved in toluene (I500ml\ This solution was then added into the vertical churner along with zinc oxide 30g and stirred for 5 hours. Paraffin oil (150g) was seperateiy dissolved in toluene 600ml and this solution was then added to the churner. After stirring for one hour, the adhesive was discharged and stabilised for 24 hours. It had percentage solids 35 and viscosity 5000 CPS. This adhesive was anplied by knife to mue suitable rat trap It was found that rats weighing 150 - 200g were trapped efficiently. These traps were reusable and therefore, its efficiency was increased.<br>
EXAMPLE - III<br>
Gum ohbimini resmoid (500g) was heated to 120Â°C in a stainless steel kettle and was added polvbutene (molecular weight 2700) (lOOOg) under stirring. This adhesive has no solvent in it and has therefore 100% solids. It was a very sticky, non poisonous adhesive. This was applied on aluminium sheets of 3mm thickness and 10 x25cm size using knite coater. The adhesive thickness was 1.0mm. It has trapped rats having weight in the range of 200 - 250g. This adhesive has practically no smell and therefore the efficacy of these traps was found to be very-high.<br>
EXAMPLE - IV<br>
In a stainless steel vessel fitted with stirrer and heating facility, gum olibinum resinoid (2.75kg) was added and heated to 100aC. To this polvbutene (molecular weight 3000) (2.5kg) was added and mixed till uniform adhesive was obtained. This adhesive was found to be more efficient in trapping rats upto 500g weight. This adhesive has viscosity of 15000 CPS. The traps were ore rarer) with niÂ»Â» thick aluminium plates<br>
EXAMPLE - V<br>
In a stainless steel reactor, equipped with stirrer and heating device, gum olibinum resinoid 1.2 kg was heated to 120Â°C and to this polybutene (molecular weight 960) 1.2 kg was added and stirred for 2 hours. The adhesive was cooled and discharged. The aluminium traps made from this adhesive could trap effectively the rats having a body weight of 100 - 150 g only.<br>
The composition prepared are not a mere admixture resulting in mere aggregation of the properties of individual ingredients but is a synergistic mixture resulting in enhanced properties as can be seen from examples I to V.<br>
In example I, the polymer is prepared which can be used for trapping rats ofweight of 100 to 150 g. while the compositions prepared in examples II to IV may be used to trap rats upto 500g weight.The main advantages of this process are :<br>
1)	The glue used for making the traps are non poisonous stick}- and disposable. Therefore, the traps can used safety in resistances, shops, large food stores, warehouses, poultry houses, market restaurants and grain elevators.<br>
2)	There were no pathological symptoms from trapped rodents at the glue material not flowing back which indicates positive trend by consumers for their utilization in house rat management.<br>
3)	Sex difference among the stickness of house rat were not observed.<br>
4)	Behaviour observation taken also indicated that the rats have not developed any shyness from the glue material.<br>
5)	The utilisation of polybutene and gum olibinum resinoid gave such strong tack}' adhesive that weights upto 500g rats were caught at a single touch.<br>
6)	The natural rubber based solvent glue is situable for trapping rats upto 200g weight. But. however, it is a solvent based product. The use of phenolic resin and gum olibinum resinoid in this formulation are tackyfiers which help in producing tacky adhesive.<br>
7)	' The solution polymerised acrylic copolymers such as poh' (butyl acrylate - ethyl hexyl<br>
acrylate) also can be used for making the traps for the management of house rats (mice) upto 150<br>
g weight. The glass transition temperatures of poly butyl acrylate and poh' ethyl hexylacrylates* are<br>
in the range of-78Â°C. This property gives the tackiness to the adhesive.<br><br><br>
