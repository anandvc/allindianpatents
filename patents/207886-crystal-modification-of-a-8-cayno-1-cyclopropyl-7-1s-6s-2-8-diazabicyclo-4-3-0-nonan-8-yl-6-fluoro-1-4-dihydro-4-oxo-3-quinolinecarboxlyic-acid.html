THE PATENTS RULES, 2003<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"CRYSTAL   MODIFICATION   OF   A   8-CAYNO-l-CYCLOPROPYL-7-(IS,6S-2,8-DIAZABICYCLO[4.3.0]NONAN-8-YL)-6-FLUORO-l,4-DIHYDRO-4-OXO-3-QUINOLINECARBOXLYIC ACID"<br>
BAYER AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT, a company of Germany, D-51368, Leverkusen, Germany,<br>
GRANTED<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
15-5-2006<br><br><br><br>
ORIGINAL 134/MUMNP/2005<br><br>
The   present   invention   relates   to   a   defined   crystal   modification   of  8-cyano-l-cyclopropyl-7-(lS,6S-2,8-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]nonan-8-yI)-6-fluoro-l,4-dihydro-4-oxo-3-quinolinecarboxylic acid, to processes for' its preparation and to its use in pharmaceutical preparations.<br>
Hereinbelow,     8-cyano-1 -cyclopropyl-7-( 1 S,6S-2,8-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]nonan-8-yl)-<br>
	6-fluoro-l,4-dihydro-4-oxo-3-quinolinecarboxylic acid of the formula (I) is referred<br>
to as CCDC.<br><br>
	CCDC is known from DE-A 19 633 805 or PCT Appl. No. 97 903 260.4. According<br>
to these publications, it is prepared by reacting 7-chloro-8-cyano-l-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-l,4-dihydro-4-oxo-3-quinolinecarboxylic acid with (lS,6S)-2,8-diaza-bicyclo[4.3.0jnonane in a mixture of dimethylformamide and acetonitrile in the presence of an auxiliary base. Water is added to the mixture and CCDC is then<br>
	extracted   from  water  using  dichloromethane  and  is  isolated  by  removing  the<br>
extractant. This gives a powder whose crystal modification is not unambiguous. On the contrary, the powder is largely amorphous and can contain mixtures of different crystal modifications. If, by chance, a uniform crystal modification is formed, it is not clear how it can be extracted and obtained in a defined form. However, it is the<br>
                 precondition for preparing medicaments that, for an active compound which can be<br><br>
present in different crystal modifications, it can be stated unambiguously which of its crystal modifications is used for preparing the agent.<br>
The partially amorphous powder, which is obtained by the preparation process<br>
outlined above, is furthermore hygroscopic. Amorphous solids, and in particular<br>
hygroscopic solids, are difficult to handle when'being processed pharmaceutically<br>
since, for example, they may have low bulk densities and unsatisfactory flow<br>
properties. Moreover, the handling of hygroscopic solids requires special work<br>
techniques and apparatuses to obtain reproducible results, for example with respect to<br>
	the active compound content or the stability of the solid formulations produced.<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to prepare a crystalline form of a defined<br>
modification of CCDC which, owing to its physical properties, in particular its<br>
crystal   properties   and   its   behaviour   towards   water,   is   easy   to   handle   in<br>
	pharmaceutical formulations.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention by a novel crystalline form of CCDC which is referred to as modification A hereinbelow.<br>
The invention accordingly provides the crystalline modification A of CCDC which is<br>
characterized by an X-ray powder diffractogram having the reflection signals (2 theta) of high and medium intensity (&gt; 30% relative intensity) listed in Table 1 below. '<br><br><br>

A characteristic X-ray powder diffractogram of the modification A is also shown in Figure 1                                                                                                                                        Moreover, the CCDC modification A according to the invention differs from other forms of CCDC in a number of further properties. These properties, on their own or together with the other parameters, may serve for characterizing the CCDC modification A according to the invention.<br>
The CCDC of the modification A is, inter alia, characterized by a melting point, determined with the aid of differential thermoanalysis (DTA), of from 249 to 252Â°C. A characteristic differential thermodiagram is shown in Figure 2.<br>
CCDC of the modification A is also characterized in that it has an infrared spectrum, measured in KBr, as shown in Figure 3.<br>
CCDC of the modification A is furthermore characterized in that it is obtainable by<br><br>
Le A 33 269-Foreign Countries<br>
the preparation process given below. The crystal modification A of CCDC is obtained by dissolving CCDC of unknown modification or amorphous CCDC in hot water or a hot alcohol/water mixture, subsequently adding an alcohol and, after cooling to room temperature, isolating the precipitated solid.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the alcohol used is ethanol or isopropanol.<br>
CCDC of the crystal modification A is surprisingly stable and does not change into<br>
another crystal modification or the amorphous form, even on prolonged storage. In<br>
addition, compared with amorphous CCDC, the modification A tends to absorb much<br>
less water from the atmosphere. For these reasons, it is highly suitable for preparing<br>
tablets or other solid formulations. Owing to its stability, it gives these formulations<br>
the desired long-lasting storage stability. Using the crystal modification A, it is<br>
therefore possible to prepare, in a defined and targeted manner, stable solid<br>
	preparations of CCDC.<br>
CCDC of the crystal modification A is highly active against pathogenic bacteria in the field of human or veterinary medicine. Its broad area of use corresponds to that of CCDC.<br>
The X-ray powder diffractogram for characterizing the crystal modification A of CCDC was obtained using a transmission diffractometer STADI-P with a location-sensitive detector (PSD2) from Stoe.<br>
	The melting point of the differential thermoanalysis was obtained using the DSC 820<br>
unit from Mettler-Toledo. Here, the sample of CCDC of the crystal modification A was heated exposed to the atmosphere in an aluminium crucible at 10 K/min.<br><br><br><br>
The KBr ER spectrum was obtained using the FTS 60A unit from Biorad.<br>
The examples below illustrate the invention without limiting it. The solvent/base systems used in the examples below are particularly preferred.<br><br>

Comparative Example<br>
A mixture of 3.07 g of 7-chIoro-8-cyano-l-cycIcpropyI-6-fluoro-I,4-dihydro-4-oxo-<br>
3-quinolinecarboxylic acid, 1.39g of (lS,6S)-2,8-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]nonane, 2.24 g<br>
of l,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO), 29.5 ml of dimethylformamide and<br>
29.5 ml of acetonitrile is stirred at room temperature for 16 hours. The reaction<br>
mixture is concentrated at a bath temperature of 60Â°C using a rotary evaporator, and<br>
the residue is taken up in 10 ml of water. The resulting solution is adjusted to pH 7<br>
using dilute hydrochloric acid, and the solid is filtered off. The filtrate is extracted<br>
	three times using 20 ml of dichloromethane each time. The organic phase is dried<br>
over sodium sulphate and filtered and the filtrate is concentrated at a bath temperature of 60Â°C using a rotary evaporator. This gives 2.4 g of a light-brown solid which has the X-ray powder diffractogram shown in Figure 4 and is therefore predominantly amorphous.<br>
At a relative atmospheric humidity of 95% (established using a saturated solution of Na2HP04 x 12 H20 with sediment in water), the solid obtained according to this procedure absorbs approximately 17 % by weight of water within one day.<br>
Example 1<br>
617 g of CCDC of any modification are dissolved in 6170 ml of chloroform. 100 g of<br>
sodium sulphate are added, ihe mixture is stirred for 5 minutes and then filtered<br>
	through 50 g of kieselguhr, which is then washed with 100 ml of chloroform. The<br>
solvent is distilled off on a rotary evaporator up to a residual pressure of 10mbar, resulting in a glass-like residue. 740 ml of water and 740 ml of ethanol are added to this residue, and the mixture is heated at 60Â°C until the entire residue has been dissolved. This solution is then added to 17 litres of boiling ethanol. This mixture is boiled for a further 5 minutes and then cooled to 35Â°C over a period of one hour. The precipitated crystals are filtered off with suction and dried at 20Â°C for.approximately<br><br>
Le A 33 269-Foreign Countries<br>
16 hours and then at 30Â°C under reduced pressure until the weight remains constant.<br>
This gives 530 g of a solid which has the X-ray powder diffractogram shown in Figure 1, the differential thermodiagram shown in Figure 2 and the DR spectrum shown in Figure 3.<br>
At a relative atmospheric humidity of 95% (established using a saturated solution of Na2HP04 x 12 H20 with sediment in water), the solid obtained according to this procedure absorbs approximately 3% by weight of water within one day.<br>
Example 2<br>
2 g of CCDC of unknown modification are dissolved in 4 ml of water. 4 ml of isopropanol are added, the reaction mixture is slowly heated with stirring and a further 32 ml oi' isopropanol are then added. The resulting clear solution is brought to the boil. The solution becomes turbid, and within a short period of time, crystals precipitate out. After 3 minutes at reflux, the heating is removed and the mixture is allowed to stand without stirring for 3 to 4 hours. The solid is then Filtered off with suction, washed with isopropanol and dried in the atmosphere until the weight remains constant. This gives 1.54 g of a solid which has an X-ray powder diffractogram identical to that shown in Figure 1, a differential thermodiagram identical to that shown in Figure 2 and an [R spectrum identical to that shown in Figure 3.<br><br>
