				<td>The present invention relates to novel ceph-S-em compound and process for preparing the same.<br>
A ceph-3-em compound according to the present invention is characterised by formula [I]:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
or a salt or ester thereof,<br>
wherein R is selected from the group consisting of a)  HOOC-X-CO-<br>
wherein X is defined as (CH2)4<br>
or wherein X Is defined as (CH2)p-A-(CH2)q, wherein<br>
p and q each individually are 0,1,2, 3 or 4, and<br>
A is CH=CH, C=C, CH8, C=0, O, S, NH. the nitrogen optionally being<br>
substituted or the sulfur optionally being oxidized, and B is hydrogen, halogen,<br>
C1-3 alkoxy, hydroxy!, or optionally substituted methyl,<br>
with the proviso that p+q should be 2 or 3, when A is CH=CH or C=C, or p+q<br>
should be 3 or 4, when A is CHB, C=0, O, S or NH<br>
or wherein X is (CH2)m-CH=A-(CH2)n or (CH2)m-OC-(CH2)n, wherein<br>
m and n each individually are 0,1, 2 or 3 and m+n = 2 or 3, and<br>
A is CH or N,<br>
or wherein X is (CH2)p-CH=CH-CH=C-{CH2)q, wherein<br>
p and q each individually are 0 or 1 and p+q = 0 or<br>
b)	(carboxymethylthlo)propionyI<br>
c)	(carboxyethyIthIo)proplonyl<br>
and wherein R' is selected from the group consisting of<br>
d)	OH<br><br>
e) O-(alkyl 1-6C) wherein the alkyl can be straight or branched and<br>
f) 0-C(alkyl 1-6C)-O-(alkyl 1-6C) wherein the alkyl groups can be straight or<br>
branched.<br>
This ceph-3-em compound [ I ] can be used as an intermediate in the<br>
production of commercial ceph-3-em antibiotics. Alternatively, this ceph-3-em<br>
compound [ I ] can be converted into another irftermediate, namely 7-amino-3-<br>
carbamoyloxymethyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid or a salt or ester thereof.<br>
A particular advantage of this ceph-3-em compound [ I ] is its<br>
enhanced stability under the conditions of purification of the compound and/or the<br>
further synthesis of commercially attractive ceph-3-em antibiotics as compared to<br>
cephalosporin C. By virtue thereof the preferred compound can be isolated more easily<br>
than cephalosporin C.<br>
Examples of commercial ceph-3-em antibiotics are cefacetril,<br>
cefaclor, cefaloglycin, cefalonium, cefaloridin, cefalotin, cefamandole, cefapirin,<br>
cefapyrin, cefatrizine, cefazedone, cefazolin, cefbuperazone, cefcapene pivoxil,<br>
cefdinir, cefditoren pivoxil, cefepime, cefixime, cefmenoxime, cefmetazole, cefminox,<br>
cefodizime, cefonicid, cefoperazone, ceforanid, cefotaxime, cefotiam, cefotiam hexetil,<br>
cefpiramide, cefpirome, cefpodoxime proxetil, cefprozil, cefroxadin, cefsulodin,<br>
ceftazidime, cefteram pivoxil, ceftezole, ceftibuten, ceftiofur, ceftizoxime, ceftriaxone,<br>
cefuroxime, cefuroxime axetil, cefuzonam.<br>
Cefuroxime, cefoxitin and cefcapene pivoxil are examples of<br>
cephalosporin antibiotics, which share a 3-carbamoyloxymethyl group, and which<br>
cannot readily be produced from the currently available ceph-3-em intermediates, such<br>
as 7-ACA. The ceph-3-em compounds according to the present invention possess a 3-<br>
carbamoyloxymethyl group and can readily be converted into these cephalosporin<br>
antibiotics as well as in other ceph-3-em antibiotics using well-known techniques.<br>
Cefazolin, ceftazidine and ceftriaxone are further most preferred<br>
cephalosporin antibiotics which can be prepared from a compound of formula [ 1 ]<br>
according to well known techniques.<br>
Furthermore, the compound according to formula [ I ]can be used<br>
itself as an antibiotic.<br>
A most preferred compound according to the present invention is the<br>
compound of the formula [II] (adipoyl-7-amino-3-carbamoyloxymethyl-3-cephem-4-<br>
carboxylic acid).<br>
(Figure Removed)The ceph-3-em compound according to the present invention can be<br>
produced chemically according to methods known in the art, or by fermentation or by a<br>
combination of one or more biotransformation steps and one or more fermentation<br>
steps and/or one or more chemical conversion steps.<br>
The present invention also comprises a fermentative method for the<br>
production of a ceph-3-em compound [I] as a secondary metabolite from a suitable<br>
genetically altered microorganism.<br>
For the fermentative production of the ceph-3-em compounds<br>
according to the present invention preferably use can be made of microorganisms,<br>
which inherently possess at least part of the metabolic pathway for the production of (3-<br>
lactam. For example, microorganisms can be used which possess at least part of the<br>
metabolic pathway for the production of penam or ceph-3-em (3-lactam compounds.<br>
Suitable organisms for this purpose are for example fungi of the genus Penicillium,<br>
such as P. chrysogenum or of the genus Acremonium, such as A. chrysogenum or of<br>
the genus Aspergillus such as A. nidulans, or bacteria of the genus Streptomyces, such<br>
as S. cJavuligeris or of the genus Nocardia, such N. lactamdurans or of the genus<br>
Lysobacter such as L. lactamgenus.<br>
Biosynthesis of the O-carbamoylated ceph-3-em compound<br>
cephamycin C in microorganisms is believed to take place according to the scheme<br>
outlined in Fig. 1. Cephalosporin C synthesis is outlined in the scheme according to<br>
Fig.2.<br>
Preferably, such genetically altered organisms are cultured under<br>
conditions in which in the resulting ceph-3-em compound the a-amino-adipyl side chain<br>
which is present at the 7-position in natural ceph-3-em compounds will be replaced by<br>
a desired side chain according to the present invention. To this end a composition able<br>
to deliver this side chain is supplied to the in vivo enzymatic conversion.<br>
Suitably the in vivo enzymatic conversion can be supplied by a side<br>
chain precursor selected from the group consisting of<br>
i) S-carboxymethylthiopropionic acid or a salt or ester thereof,<br>
ii) 3,3-thiodipropionic acid or a salt or ester thereof,<br>
iii) a compound p Y- CH2-COOH or a salt or ester thereof<br>
wherein Y is phenyl, phenoxy or tetrazolyl,<br>
iv) a compound of the general formula HOOC-X-COOH or a salt or ester<br>
thereof,<br>
wherein X Is defined as (CH2)4<br>
or wherein X is defined as (CH2)p-A-(CH2)q, wherein<br>
p and q each individually are 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4, and<br>
A is CH=CH, C=C, CHB, C=O, O, S, NH, the nitrogen optionally being<br>
substituted or the sulfur optionally being oxidized, and B is hydrogen,<br>
halogen, C alkoxy, hydroxyl, or optionally substituted methyl,<br>
with the proviso that p+q should be 2 or 3, when A is CH=CH or C=C, or<br>
p+q should be 3 or 4, when A is CHB, C=O, O, S or NH<br>
or wherein X is (CH2)m-CH-A-(CH2)n or (CH2)ro-CsC-(CH2)n, wherein<br>
m and n each individually are 0, 1, 2 or 3 and m+n = 2 or 3, and<br>
A is CH or N,<br>
or wherein X is (CH2)p-CH=CH-CH=C-(CH2)q, wherein<br>
p and q each individually are 0 or 1 and p+q = 0 or 1<br>

undesired side products.<br>
If L lactamgenus is chosen as host, at least penDE and cmcH should<br>

Insertion and inactivation of genes in organisms in order to provide<br>
the genetic make-up for the production of a compound according to the present<br>
invention can be carried out by methods known in the art. For the insertion use can be<br>
made of genomic DNA sequences or if desired use can be made of cDNA.<br>

by said strain of P. chrysogenum to produce a suitable acyl-6-<br>
aminopenicillanic acid (acyl-6-APA), whereby said acyl-6-APA is produced;<br>
B) carrying out the following enzymatic conversions by in situ expression of the<br>
corresponding genes:<br>
I) the acyl-6-APA is in situ ring-expanded to form the corresponding acyl-7-<br>
amino-desacetoxycephalosporanic acid (acyl-7-ADCA) by expandase<br>
enzyme, wherein said strain of P. chrysogenum has been transformed by<br>
DNA encoding the expandase enzyme capable of accepting said acyl-6-<br>

ii) the 3-methyl side chain of said acyl-7-ADCA is in situ hydroxylated to yield<br>
-8-<br>
the corresponding acyl-7-ADAC by hydroxylase enzyme, wherein said strain<br>

as a result of its expression, said acyl-7-ADCA produced by said strain is<br>
also thereafter in situ hydroxylated to form the corresponding acyl-7-ADAC;<br>

capable of accepting said acyl-7-ADAC as a substrate, whereupon as a<br>
result of its expression, said acyl-7-ADAC produced by said strain is also<br>
thereafter in situ carbamoylated to form a compound according to the<br>
present invention.<br>
The DNA encoding the expandase enzyme, hydroxylase enzyme, or<br>
O-carbamoyl transferase enzyme for use according to the present invention can be<br>
obtained from micro-organisms reported to contain this DNA and which are available<br>
from culture collections or it may be obtained from micro-organisms isolated from<br>
appropriate natural sources.<br>
Examples of microorganisms reported to contain the expandase<br>
enzyme are A chrysogenum (cefEF), S. clavuligerus (cefE), N. lactamdurans (cefE), L.<br>
lactamgenus (cefE).<br>
Examples of microorganisms reported to contain the hydroxylase<br>
enzyme are A. chrysogenum (cefEF), S. clavuligerus (cefF), N. lactamdurans (cefF), L<br>
lactamgenus (cefF).<br>
Examples of microorganisms reported to contain the O-carbamoyl<br>
transferase enzyme are species from the Order Actinomycetes, and In particular from<br>
the Genus Streptomyces. Based on the disclosure in US Patent No. 4,075,061,<br>
particularly suitable species which may be employed to provide the DNA encoding the<br>
desired O-transcarbamoylase activity include S. clavuligerus for example strain NRRL<br>
3585 as described in British Patent No. 1,315,177; S. wadayamensis, for example<br>
strain ATCC 21948 as described in Dutch Patent Application No. 7308948; S.<br>
albogriseolus, for example strain NRRL 5735 as described in U.S. Patent No.<br>
3,914,158; S. lactamdurans for example strain NRRL 3802 as described in British<br>
Patent No. 1,321,412 and S. jumonjinensis, for example strain NRRL 5741 as<br>
described in British Patent No. 1,387,965.<br>
According to the disclosure of Patent Publication WO 95/29253<br>
further suitable sources of the desired O-carbamoyl transferase encoding DNA may be<br>
N. lactamdurans, S. lipmanii, S. panayensis, S. cattleya, S. griseus, S. todorominensis,<br>
S. filipinensls cephamldni and S. heteromorphus.<br>
Transformation of host cells, for example of P. chrysogenum or other<br>
fungi can, in general, be achieved by different means of tiNA delivery, like PEG-Ca<br>
mediated protoplast uptake, electroporation or particle gun techniques, and selection of<br>
transformants. See for example Van den Hondel and Punt, "Gene and Transfer and<br>
Vector Development for Filamentous Fungi", in: Applied Molecular Genetics of Fungi<br>
(Peberdy, Laten, Ogden, Bennett, eds.), Cambridge University Press (1991). The<br>
application of dominant and non-dominant selection markers has been described (Van<br>
den Hondel et a/., supra). Selection markers of both homologous (P. chrysogenum<br>
derived) and heterologous (non-P. chrysogenum derived) origin have been described<br>
(Gouka et a/., J. Biotechnol. 20 (1991) 189-200).<br>
The application of various homologous or heterologous transformant<br>
selection markers, in the presence or absence of vector sequences, physically linked or<br>
not.to the non-selectable DNA, in the selection of transformants is well known.<br>
The DNA sequence encoding the expandase activity, the hydroxylase<br>
activity and the O-carbamoyl transferase activity are introduced into and expressed in<br>
this way in P. chrysogenum, for instance in strain Wisconsin 54-1255 (deposited at<br>
ATCC under accession number 28089). Other strains of P. chrysogenum, including<br>
mutants of strain Wisconsin 54-1255, having an improved beta-lactam yield, are also<br>
suitable. Examples of such high-yielding strains are the strains CBS 455.95, Panlabs<br>
P2 and ASP-78 (Barredo JL, Alvarez E, Cantoral JM, Diez B, Martin JF. 1988.<br>
Antimlcrob Agents Chemother32(7):1061-7).<br>
Furthermore, the cmcH gene together with the cefE and ce/F or<br>
ce/EFgene are placed under the transcriptional and translational control of<br>
heterologous or homologous control elements, preferably under control of fungal gene<br>
control elements. Those elements can be obtained from cloned fungal genes like the<br>
P.chrysogenum IPNS orpobC gene, the B-tubulin gene, the A. nidulans gpdA gene, or<br>
the A. nigerglaA gene.<br>
As an alternative to a complete fermentative production, the<br>
compound according to the present invention can be prepared by a combination of one<br>
or more fermentative steps and one or more biotransformation steps and/or one or<br>
more chemical conversion steps.<br>
For example, in a first step a suitable penicillin derivative, such as<br>
penicillin G or penicillin V, or cephalosporin derivative such as adipoyl-7-ADCA or<br>
adipoyl-7-ADAC can be produced fermentatively.<br>
A suitable penicillin derivative optionally can be subjected to<br>
exchange of the 6-acyl group before conversion into the corresponding 7-acyl-3-<br>
* methyl-ceph-3-em compound. The latter can in turn be converted into the<br>
corresponding 7-acyl-3-hydroxymethyl-ceph-3-em, and finally into the compound of<br>
formula [I].<br>
For these conversions the necessary enzymes (acyltransferase,<br>
expandase, hydroxylase and carbamoyltransferase, or, alternatively, acyltransferase,<br>
exandase-hydroxylase and carbamoyltransferase, encoded by the penDE, cefE, cefF<br>
and c/ncH genes orpenDE, ce/EFand cmcH genes, respectively) can be produced<br>
separately in any suitable host. Preferably, this is done in Escherichia co//according to<br>
a process known in the art. Enzymes can be purified and if needed immobilized, or<br>
used in whole cell biotransformations or crude cell-free extracts, in single and<br>
consecutive reaction vessels, or, in a one-pot reaction, to form the compound of<br>
formula [I].<br>
Single steps in this multi-step route (e.g. penicillin G - acyl-6-APA -<br>
acyl-7-ADCA -acyl-7-ADAC -» compound [I]) can be exchanged for fermentative or<br>
chemical conversion steps. E.g. the first step can be omitted if one uses adipoyl-7-<br>
ADCA produced by P. chrysogenum transformed with cefE (e.g. according to the<br>
method described in EP0523341), or alternatively, the first two steps can be omitted by<br>
starting from acyl-7-ADAC produced by P. chrysogenum transformed with cefE and<br>
cefF (e.g. according to the method described in EP0540210). As an alternative,<br>
chemical conversions known in the art for each single step can be applied.<br>

Example 1<br>
Transformation of a P. chrysogenum strain with the genes encoding expandase,<br>
hydroxylase and 3'-hydroxymethylcephem O-carbamoyltransferase activity<br>
Common techniques used in gene cloning procedures are used in the<br>
present application. These techniques include polymerase chain reactions (PCR),<br>
synthetic oligonucleotide synthesis, nucleotide sequence analysis of DNA, enzymatic<br>
ligation and restriction of DNA, E. co//vector subcloning, transformation, and<br>
transformant selection, isolation and purification of DNA, DNA characterization by<br>
Southemblot analysis. These techniques are all very well known in the art and<br>
adequately described in many references.<br>
Transformations were carried out with the P. chrysogenum strain<br>
Wisconsin 54-1255 (ATTC 28089). All constructs introduced in P. chrysogenum are<br>
under the control of the P. chrysogenum IPNS promoter and AT terminator. Other<br>
strains of P. chrysogenum, including mutants of strain Wisconsin 54-1255, having an<br>
improved B-lactam yield, are also suitable. An example of such a strain is CBS 455.95.<br>
Culturing of P. chrysogenum for generation of protoplasts used in<br>
transformation is done in YPD- medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose). It<br>
is well known in the art that the protoplasting and regeneration procedures may differ<br>
slightly depending on the particular strain of P. chrysogenum used and the<br>
transformant selection procedure applied.<br>
S. clavuligerus ATCC 27064 is grown in tryptic soy broth (Difco).<br>
Chromosomal DNA of this strain is used for isolation of the ce/Egene by PCR. The 5'<br>
forward primer 4363: 5'-GAT CAG TGA CAG TTG CAT ATG GAC ACG ACG GTG<br>
CCC ACC TTC AGC CTG-31 (SEQ ID NO. 1) and the 3' reversed primer number 4364:<br>
5'-CCC GGG TCT AGA TCT AGA CTA TGC CTT GGA TGT GCG GCG GAT GTT-3'<br>
(SEQ ID NO. 2) were designed using the published S. clavuligerus Ce/E sequence<br>
(Kovacevlc S, Weigel BJ, Tobin MB, Ingolia TD, Miller JR. J Bacteriol (1989)<br>
171(2):754-60; Ingolia et a/. U.S. Pat. No. 5,070,020).<br>
The obtained PCR product was cut with A/del and Xba\ and the 0.9 kb<br>
fragment was ligated with pMcTNdel also cut with A/del and Xba\ (fragment: 3.9 kb)<br>
resulting in pMcTSE. pMCTNdel is a derivative of pMC-5 (Stanssens et a/. NAR<br>
(1989) 17:4441) and constructed by insertion of a fragment encoding the tac promoter<br>
followed by a ribosome binding sequence (RBS) site and a A/del cloning site (see also<br>
E.P. Pat. No.0,351,029).<br>
First the AT promoter was cloned in front of the expandase gene. The<br>
AT promoter was obtained by PCR using primer 4488: 5-AGA ACG GAT TAG TTA<br>
GTC TGA ATT CAA CAA GAA CGG CCA GAC-3' (SEQ ID NO. 3) and 4489: 5'-GAC<br>
AGA GGA TGT GAA GCA TAT GTG CTG CGG GTC GGA AGA TGG-3' (SEQ ID NO.<br>
4) on chromosomal DNA of P. chrysogenum. The oligo's were based on the P.<br>
chrysogenum penDE gene sequence published by Barredo ef a/., (1989) Gene 83:572-<br>
576 and Diez et a/., Mol. Gen. Genet. (1989) 218:572-576. The product was digested<br>
with EcoR\ and Nde\ resulting in a 1.5 kb fragment. This fragment was ligated with<br>
pBluescript (Stratagene) EcoR\-Xba\ fragment of 3,0 kb and with pMcTSE Ndel-Xbal<br>
fragment of 0.9 kb containing the S. clavuligerus expandase gene. This results in the<br>
plasmid pASE containing the expandase gene in behind the AT promoter.<br>
The penDE (encoding AT) terminator was cloned behind the<br>
expandase gene in the pASE plasmid. Therefore, chromosomal DNA of P.<br>
chrysogenum was used as template for the PCR of the AT terminator using 5' forward<br>
primer 4579: 5'-TTC GAT GTC AGC CTG GAC GGC GAG ACC GCC ACG TTC CAG<br>
GAT TGG ATC GGG GGC AAC TAG GTG AAC ATC CGC CGC ACA TCC AAG GCA<br>
TGA AGG CTC TTC ATG ACG-31 (SEQ ID NO. 6) and 3' reversed primer 4507: 5'-<br>
GGA CTA GTG TCG ACC CTG TCC ATC CTG AAA GAG TTG (SEQ ID NO. 5). The<br>
fragment was digested with Sg/I-Spel and the 0.6 kb product was ligated with the<br>
plasmid pASE digested with Spel and Bgl\ resulting in pASEWA.<br>
Finally, the expandase gene was put behind the P. chrysogenum<br>
IPNS promoter (the IPNS promoter replacing the AT promoter). The IPNS promoter<br>
was amplified using P. chrysogenum chromosomal DNA as a template with 5' oligo<br>
4923: 5'-CGA GGG GAA TTC CTT ATA CTG GGC TG CTG CAT TGG TCT G (SEQ<br>
ID NO. 7) (using the sequence published by: Diez.B., Gutierrez,S., Barredo.J.L, van<br>
Solingen,P., van der Voort,LH. and Martin.J.F. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265 (27), 16358-<br>
16365) and 3' oligo 4924: 5'-CCC GGG CAT ATG CAT ATG GGT GTC TAG AAA AAT<br>
AAT GGT GAA AAC (SEQ ID NO. 8) (using the sequence published by Carr LG,<br>
Skatrud PL, Scheetz ME 2nd, Queener SW, Ingolia TD. (1986) Gene 48(2-3):257-66).<br>
pASEWA is digested with EcoRl and A/del resulting in a 4.6 kb fragment with the<br>
expandase gene and the AT terminator was ligated with the 0.9 kb IPNS promoter PCR<br>
product digested with EcoRI-A/del. This yields pISEWA. The ce/E gene with the IPNS<br>
promoter and the AT terminator was obtained from pISEWAn by a Nofi digestion<br>
(fig.3).<br>
The hydroxylase gene (cefF) was isolated from S. clavuligerus (ATCC<br>
27064). Chromosomal DNA of this strain was used for isolation of the ce/Fgene by<br>
PCR introducing a Nde\ site upstream of the gene and a Ate/1 site downstream. This<br>
construct was ligated behind the IPNS promoter and in front of the AT terminator<br>
resulting In pISFWA. For transformation of P. chrysogenum the construct including the<br>
ce/Fgene and the IPNS prmoter and AT terminator was isolated from pISFWA (Fig. 4)<br>
after cutting with A/ofl.<br>
The A. chrysogenum (= Cephalospon'um acremonium)<br>
expandase/hydroxylase gene (cefEF), was obtained from chromosomal DNA by PCR.<br>
The designed forward oligo introduced a Ndel site and the reversed oligo a Nsil site.<br>
After digestion with Ndel and Nsil the gene could be placed in the Penicillium<br>
expression vector resulting in pICEFWA (fig. 5). For transformation of Penicillium, me<br>
ce/EFfrom A. chrysogenum was isolated from pICEFWA with the IPNS promoter and<br>
AT terminator by a Nof/ digestion.<br>
The cmcH gene was obtained from S. clavuligerus by PCR on<br>
chromosomal DNA with the forward primer: AB12586 (5-ACA GAC CAT ATG CTC<br>
GTC GTT GCA TTC AAG -3' (SEQ ID NO. 9)) and the reversed primer: 5'-AB12587<br>
(GAC GGC ATG CAT TCA GGA ACC GGC TAT TCG C-3' (SEQ ID NO. 10)) and was<br>
cut with Ndel, Nsil and ligated with the Ndel, Nsil fragment of pISEWAN (replacing the<br>
expandase gene for the cmcH gene) yielding pIScCTWA (Fig. 6). The cmcH gene<br>
including the IPNS promoter and the AT terminator was isolated from pIScCTWA by a<br>
A/ofl digest.<br>
The AmdS fragment with flanks of HelY was isolated from pHELY-A1<br>
by a digestion with Hind\\l (fig. 7).<br>
The cmcH, with cefEF or cefE and cefF constructs were introduced<br>
by co-transformation with the amdS selection marker in P. chrysogenum ATCC 28089.<br>
The integration of the amdS marker enables the P. chrysogenum transformants to grow<br>
on selection medium containing acetamide as the sole nitrogen source.<br>
Techniques involved in the transfer of DNA to protoplasts of P.<br>
chrysogenum are well known in the art and are described in many references, including<br>
Finkelstein and Ball (eds.), Biotechnology of filamentous fungi, technology and<br>
products, Butterworth-Heinemann (1992); Bennett and Lasure (eds.) More Gene<br>
Manipulations in fungi, Academic Press (1991); Turner, in: POhler (ed), Biotechnology,<br>
second completely revised edition, VHC (1992). The Ca-PEG mediated protoplast<br>
transformation is used as described in EP635574.<br>

The P. chrysogenum transformants obtained according to Example 1<br>
were inoculated at 2x10s conidia/ml into a medium as described for penicillinV<br>
production tests in US20020039758, but instead of potassium phenoxyacetate it was<br>
supplemented with 0.5-10 mg/ml sodium adipate as a side chain precursor (pH before<br>
sterilization 5.5-6.0). The incubation took place for 144 -169 hours at 25°C and 280<br>
rotations per minute.<br>
Filtrates of well grown cultures were analysed by HPLC and NMR for<br>
the production of adipoyl-7-amino-3-carbamoyloxymethy!-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid.<br>

Preparation of cell-free extract<br>
The c/ncHgene of Streptomyces clavuligerusvtas expressed in <br>
co//XL1-Blue under the control of the lac promoter using plasmid pGK105 (Figure 11).<br>
For expression of the cmcHgene, 5 ml of chloramphenicol-containing LB growth<br>
medium was inoculated with a single colony of XL1-Blue:pGK105 and grown at 37°C<br>
for 16 hours with shaking at 250 rpm. This culture was used as a 1% inoculum for a<br>
flask containing 100 ml of sterile LB medium supplemented with chloramphenicol which<br>
was then incubated at 27°C with shaking at 250 rpm and good aeration until the OD600<br>
reached 0.4-0.6. IPTG was then added to the culture to a final concentration of 0.3 mM<br>
and growth was continued for a further 16 hours. Cells were harvested by<br>
centrifugation .(4000 g, 20 min, 4°C) and the cell pellet was resuspended in 5 ml buffer<br>
(20 mM Tris.HCI, 200 mM NaCI, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7) and frozen either at -80°C for 1<br>
hour or at -20°C overnight. After thawing in an ice-water bath, the cell suspension was<br>
sonicated (MSE Soniprep 150). 15-20 Cycles of 10 s sonication each followed by 10<br>
sec. of cooling time were sufficient for complete lysis as monitored by release of<br>
soluble protein using Bradford assay. Cell debris, insoluble protein and unlyzed cells<br>
were pelleted by centrifugation (4000 g, 60 min, 4°C). The supernatant was treated with<br>
potassium clavulanate (5 mgrnl"1) for 1 hour at 27 °C to inactivate any chromosomally<br>
encoded p-lactamases. Excess clavulanate was removed by gel filtration over<br>
Sephadex G-25® using PD-10 desalting columns and the resulting enzyme solution<br>
was used immediately or stored at -20°C until required.<br>
Carbamoyl transferase assay<br>
Assays (100 |j,l) were performed at 28°C for four hours and contained<br>
adipoyl-deacetylcephalosporanic acid (1-5 mM), MgSO4 (0.8 mM), MnCI2 (1 mM),<br>
imidazole (100 mM), ATP (5.4 mM), carbamoyl phosphate (9.8 mM), pH 6.75-7. The<br>
amount of protein used ranged from 10 ug to 250 ug. The enzyme solution was thawed<br>
on ice before adding to the reaction mixture, which had been allowed to reach 28°C in<br>
a heating block. The reaction was terminated by the addition of ice-cold methanol (100<br>
ul) and mixed before centrifuging (10000 g, 5 min, 4°C) to pellet the precipitated<br>
protein. Soluble protein that had been denatured by heat-treating at 100°C for 5 min<br>
was used in a control reaction, which was always performed alongside normal assays.<br>
HPLC/MS analysis<br>
Separation of reaction components was achieved on a Spherisorb<br>
analytical C18 column (250 x 4.6 mm) at RT using a Gilson HPLC system with a mobile<br>

sodium dihydrogen phosphate/50% acetonitrile as buffer B, a flow rate of 1 ml/min"1<br>
and monitoring at 254 nm. Using these conditions authentic standards of the<br>
cephalosporin starting material and product had retention times of 19 min and 22.5 min<br>
respectively. Product peaks from several analytical runs were pooled, acidified to pH<br>
1.8 and extracted with cyclohexanone. The organic phase was then back-extracted<br>
with water with the pH of the Diphasic extraction mixture adjusted to 7 in between<br>
periodic shaking. The aqueous phase was lyophilised, redissolved in water and<br>
analysed by electrospray (negative ion mode) ionisation MS and the carbamoylated<br>
cephalosporin product identified from its characteristic [M - Hf (Figure 12).<br>
Conclusion<br>
From this experiment it can be concluded that adipoyl-7-amino-3-<br>
carbamoyloxymethyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid can be produced using byconversion<br>
Example 5<br>
Extracellular export of adipoyl-7-amino-3-carbamoyloxymethyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylic<br>
acid<br>
The samples as prepared according to Example 2 were analysed in<br>
more detail by separating the biomass from the filtrate. After 168 hours of growth at 25<br>
degrees Celsius and 280 rotations per minute, the filtrates of well-grown cultures were<br>
separated from biomass via filtration and analysed by NMR. The biomass was washed<br>
twice with ice cold physiological salt (0.9 mM NaCI), frozen in liquid nitrogen, freeze<br>
dried, resuspended in water, and also analysed by NMR.<br>
Besides adipoyl-7-amino-3-carbamoyloxymethyl-3-cephem-4-<br>
carboxylic acid the strains also produce intermediates, respectively IPN, 6APA,<br>
adSAPA, ad7ADCA and adAHCA (=adADAC). However, adipoyl-7-amino-3-<br>
carbamoyloxymethyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid is the only p-lactam exclusively<br>
secreted.<br>

were inoculated in production test medium as described in example 2, but in stead of<br>
sodium acetate it was supplemented with 5 mg/ml potassium phenoxyacetate as a side<br>
chain precursor for production tests (pH before filtration 6.0). The cultivation time was<br>
168 hours at 25 degrees Celsius and 280 rotations per minute.<br>
Filtrates of well-grown cultures were separated from biomass and<br>
analysed by NMR. The biomass was washed twice with ice cold physiological salt (0.9<br>

sodium acetate it was supplemented with 4 mg/ml transhydromuconic acid as a side<br>
chain precursor for production tests (pH before filtration 6.0). The cultivation time was<br>
168 hours at 25 degrees celsius and 280 rotations per minute.<br>
Filtrates of well-grown cultures were separated from biomass and<br>
analysed by NMR. The biomass was washed twice with ice cold physiological salt (0.9<br>

Bioactivity of adipoyl-7-amino-3-carbamoyloxymethyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid<br>
Theadipoyl-7-amino-3-carbamoyloxymethyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylic<br>
acid prepared according to Example 3 was used to evaluate its activity versus different<br>
bacteria. Bacteria used were: Escherichia coli ESS [xxxref komt nogxx], Micrococcus<br>
luteus DSM 348 [Andrade, A.C., Van Nistelrooy, J.G.M., Peery, R.B., Skatrud, P.L., De<br>
Waard, M.A., 2000, The role of ABC transporters from Aspergillus nldulans in<br>
protection against cytotoxic agents and in antibiotic production] and Bacillus subtilis<br>
ATCC 6633 [xxxref komt nogxx] The bacteria were grown overnight in liquid 2xTY<br>
[xxxref komt nogxx] at 37 degrees and 280 rotations per minute and subsequently<br>
diluted 1000-fold in fresh medium. Two ml deep-well mlcrotiterplates were inoculated<br>
with 1 ml of the diluted bacterial cultures and different concentrations of adipoyl-7-<br>
amino-3-carbamoyIoxymethyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid (adipoyl-ACCA or Ad-ACCA)<br>
were added to individual wells wells. As control several other active and less-active blactams<br>
were used: 6-APA, Adipoyl-6-APA, 7-ADCA, adipoyl-7-ADCA, 7-ACA,<br>
cephalosporinC and cefuroxime. The microtiterplates were incubated for 2 days at 25<br>
degrees Celsius and 550 rotations per minute.<br>
The results for growth inhibition by adipoyl-7-ADCA, adipoyl-ACCA<br>
and cefuroxime are summarized in Figures 14 (B. subtilis), 15 (£ coli) and 16 (M.<br>
