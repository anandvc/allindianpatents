FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention pertains generally to vehicle powertrain systems, and more<br>
specifically to a control system for a hybrid transmission system for a vehicle.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Various hybrid powertrain architectures are known for managing the input and<br>
output torques of various prime-movers in hybrid vehicles, most commonly<br>
internal combustion engines and electric machines. Hybrid powertrain systems<br>
are generally characterized by an internal combustion engine and one or more<br>
electrical machines which provide motive torque to a vehicle driveline using a<br>
transmission device.<br>
One parallel-hybrid powertrain architecture comprises a two-mode, compound-<br>
split, electro-mechanical transmission which has an input member for receiving<br>
motive torque from a source, e.g. an internal combustion engine, and an output<br>
member for delivering motive torque from the transmission, typically to a<br>
driveline of a vehicle. First and second electrical machines comprising<br>
motor/generators provide motive torque to the transmission and are operatively<br>
connected to an energy storage device for interchanging electrical power<br>
between the storage device and the first and second motor/generators.<br>
Operation of various components and systems of the hybrid powertrain system<br>
and the vehicle typically requires a control system using one or more electronic<br>
controllers. The controllers are used to control various aspects of the vehicle.<br>
The vehicle system requires ongoing control to meet operator demands for<br>
driveability and fuel economy, meet system demands related to the hybrid<br><br><br>
system, including charging and discharging of energy storage devices, provide<br>
accessory capability and demands, and demands, and meet mandated<br>
requirements for emissions and durability.<br>
A designer deciding upon an architecture for a control system of a hybrid system<br>
must balance multiple, competing requirements, including providing sufficient<br>
computing power to accomplish various vehicle, powertrain and subsystem<br>
management tasks in a timely manner while being cost-effective. Other issues<br>
include having a control system which meets quality, reliability and durability<br>
targets, is able to comply with electromagnetic interference requirements, and is<br>
packagable within the vehicle. When multiple controllers are used,<br>
communications between the controllers may be constrained by availability and<br>
bandwidth of a local area network. There is also a need to have a control system<br>
architecture that has a level of reusability, thus being portable to multiple vehicle<br>
platforms and systems with minimal redesign. There is a further need to have a<br>
control system which is readily expanded to accommodate new features and<br>
capabilities during a system life cycle. There is also a need to have a control<br>
system which communicates readily with outside system, to accomplish such<br>
tasks as system calibration, programming, and diagnostics.<br>
US 5637987 discloses a hybrid electric vehicle having an internal combustion<br>
engine, a multi-speed automatic transmission, and an electric machine operable<br>
in a motoring mode and a generating mode. A compound planetary gear set<br>
operatively couples the engine, transmission and electric machine. The electric<br>
machine is operable during periods of vehicle launch to provide a reaction torque<br>
for the planetary gearset such that torque is supplied to the input of the<br>
transmission and the reaction torque energy is converted to electrical energy for<br>
storage in a vehicle battery pack battery. The method employs a combination of<br><br><br>
open loop torque control and closed loop speed controls responsive to rotational<br>
parameters of the vehicle drivetrain including engine speed, electric machine<br>
rotor speed and transmission input speed to control the generator torque of the<br>
electric machine to thereby produce the reaction torque for accelerating the<br>
vehicle and for producing electrical power during the vehicle launch.<br>
Therefore, there is a need for an optimized control system architecture for a<br>
hybrid powertrain system which effectively uses on-board computing resources<br>
to meet the aforementioned requirements.<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
 The invention may take physical form in certain parts and<br>
arrangement of parts, the preferred embodiment of which will be described in<br>
detail and illustrated in the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof,<br>
and wherein:<br>
 Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram of an exemplary powertrain, in<br>
accordance with the present invention;<br>
 Fig. 2 is a schematic diagram of an exemplary control system<br>
architecture and powertrain, in accordance with the present invention; and,<br>
Fig. 3 and 4 are schematic diagrams of aspects of the exemplary<br>
control system architecture, in accordance with the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
 Referring now to the drawings, wherein the showings are for the<br>
purpose of illustrating the invention only and not for the purpose of limiting<br>
the same, Figs. 1 and 2 show a system comprising an engine 14, transmission<br>
10, control system, and driveline which has been constructed in accordance<br>
with an embodiment of the present invention.<br><br><br>
 Mechanical aspects of exemplary transmission 10 are disclosed in<br>
detail in commonly assigned U.S. Patent Application Publication No. U.S.<br>
2005/0137042 A1, published June 23, 2005, entitled Two-Mode. Compound-<br>
Split. Hybrid Electro-Mechanical Transmission having Four Fixed Ratios,<br>
which is incorporated herein by reference. The exemplary two-mode,<br>
compound-split, electro-mechanical hybrid transmission embodying the<br>
concepts of the present invention is depicted in Fig. 1, and is designated<br>
generally by the numeral 10. The hybrid transmission 10 has an input member<br>
12 that may be in the nature of a shaft which receives motive torque from an<br>
internal combustion engine 14. A transient torque damper 20 is incorporated<br>
between the output shaft 18 of the engine 14 and the input member 12 of the<br>
hybrid transmission 10. The transient torque damper 20 preferably comprises<br>
a torque transfer device 77 having characteristics of a damping mechanism<br>
and a spring, shown respectively as 78 and 79. The transient torque damper<br>
20 permits selective engagement of the engine 14 with the hybrid transmission<br>
10, but it must be understood that the torque transfer device 77 is not utilized<br>
to change, or control, the mode in which the hybrid transmission 10 operates.<br>
The torque transfer device 77 preferably comprises a hydraulically operated<br>
friction clutch, referred to as clutch C5.<br>
 The engine 14 may be any of numerous forms of internal combustion<br>
engines, such as a spark-ignition engine or a compression-ignition engine,<br>
readily adaptable to provide a power output to the transmission 10 at a range<br>
of operating speeds, from idle, at or near 600 revolutions per minute (RPM), to<br>
over 6,000 RPM. Irrespective of the means by which the engine 14 is<br>
connected to the input member 12 of the transmission 10, the input member 12<br>
is connected to a planetary gear set 24 in the transmission 10.<br>
 Referring specifically now to Fig. 1, the hybrid transmission 10<br>
utilizes three planetary-gear sets 24, 26 and 28. The first planetary gear set 24<br>
has an outer gear member 30 that may generally be designated as a ring gear,<br>
which circumscribes an inner gear member 32, generally designated as a sun<br><br>
gear. A plurality of planetary gear members 34 are rotatably mounted on a<br>
carrier 36 such that each planetary gear member 34 meshingly engages both<br>
the outer gear member 30 and the inner gear member 32.<br>
 The second planetary gear set 26 also has an outer gear member 38,<br>
generally designated as a ring gear, which circumscribes an inner gear member<br>
40, generally designated as a sun gear. A plurality of planetary gear members<br>
42 are rotatably mounted on a carrier 44 such that each planetary gear 42<br>
meshingly engages both the outer gear member 38 and the inner gear<br>
member 40.<br>
 The third planetary gear set 28 also has an outer gear member 46,<br>
generally designated as a ring gear, which circumscribes an inner gear member<br>
48, generally designated as a sun gear. A plurality of planetary gear members<br>
50 are rotatably mounted on a carrier 52 such that each planetary gear 50<br>
meshingly engages both the outer gear member 46 and the inner gear member<br>
48.<br>
 Ratios of teeth on ring gears/sun gears are typically based upon<br>
design considerations known to skilled practitioners and outside the scope of<br>
the present invention. By way of example, in one embodiment, the ring<br>
gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 24 is 65/33; the ring gear/sun<br>
gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 26 is 65/33; and the ring gear/sun gear<br>
tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 28 is 94/34.<br>
 The three planetary gear sets 24, 26 and 28 each comprise simple<br>
planetary gear sets. Furthermore, the first and second planetary gear sets 24<br>
and 26 are compounded in that the inner gear member 32 of the first planetary<br>
gear set 24 is conjoined, as through a hub plate gear 54, to the outer gear<br>
member 38 of the second planetary gear set 26. The conjoined inner gear<br>
member 32 of the first planetary gear set 24 and the outer gear member 38 of<br>
the second planetary gear set 26 are continuously connected to a first<br>
motor/generator or electrical machine 56, also referred to as 'Motor A'.<br><br>
 The planetary gear sets 24 and 26 are further compounded in that the<br>
carrier 36 of the first planetary gear set 24 is conjoined, as through a shaft 60,<br>
to the carrier 44 of the second planetary gear set 26. As such, carriers 36 and<br>
44 of the first and second planetary gear sets 24 and 26, respectively, are<br>
conjoined. The shaft 60 is also selectively connected to the carrier 52 of the<br>
third planetary gear set 28, as through a torque transfer device 62 which, as<br>
will be hereinafter more fully explained, is employed to assist in me selection<br>
of the operational modes of the hybrid transmission 10. The carrier 52 of the<br>
third planetary gear set 28 is connected directly to the transmission output<br>
member 64.<br>
 In the embodiment described herein, wherein the hybrid transmission<br>
10 is used in a land vehicle, the output member 64 is operably connected to a<br>
driveline comprising a gear box 90 or other torque transfer device which<br>
provides a torque output to one or more vehicular axles 92 or half-shafts (not<br>
shown). The axles 92, in turn, terminate in drive members 96. The drive<br>
members 96 may be either front or rear wheels of the vehicle on which they<br>
are employed, or they may be a drive gear of a track vehicle. The drive<br>
members 96 may have some form of wheel brake 94 associated therewith.<br>
The drive members each have a speed parameter, NWHL, comprising rotational<br>
speed of each wheel 96 which is typically measurable with a wheel speed<br>
sensor.<br>
 The inner gear member 40 of the second planetary gear set 26 is<br>
connected to the inner gear member 48 of the third planetary gear set 28, as<br>
through a sleeve shaft 66 mat circumscribes shaft 60. The outer gear member<br>
46 of the third planetary gear set 28 is selectively connected to ground,<br>
represented by the transmission housing 68, through a torque transfer device<br>
70. Torque transfer device 70, as is also hereinafter explained, is also<br>
employed to assist in the selection of the operational modes of the hybrid<br>
transmission 10. The sleeve shaft 66 is also continuously connected to a<br>
second motor/generator or electrical machine 72, also referred to as 'Motor B'.<br><br>
9<br>
 All the planetary gear sets 24, 26 and 28 as well as the two<br>
motor/generators 56 and 72 are coaxially oriented, as about the axially<br>
disposed shaft 60. Motor/generators 56 and 72 are both of an annular<br>
configuration which permits them to circumscribe the three planetary gear sets<br>
24, 26 and 28 such that the planetary gear sets 24, 26 and 28 are disposed<br>
radially inwardly of the motor/generators 56 and 72. This configuration<br>
assures that the overall envelope, i.e., the circumferential dimension, of the<br>
transmission 10 is minimized.<br>
 A torque transfer device 73 selectively connects the sun gear 40 with<br>
ground, i.e., with transmission housing 68. A torque transfer device 75 is<br>
operative as a lock-up clutch, locking planetary gear sets 24, 26, Motors 56, 72<br>
and the input to rotate as a group, by selectively connecting the sun gear 40<br>
with the carrier 44. The torque transfer devices 62, 70, 73, 75 are all friction<br>
clutches, respectively referred to as follows: clutch C1 70, clutch C2 62,<br>
clutch C3 73, and clutch C4 75. Each clutch is preferably hydraulically<br>
actuated, receiving pressurized hydraulic fluid from a pump. Hydraulic<br>
actuation is accomplished using a known hydraulic fluid circuit that is an<br>
element of the transmission and not described in detail herein.<br>
 The hybrid transmission 10 receives input motive torque from a<br>
plurality of torque-generative devices, including the engine 14 and the<br>
electrical machines 56 and 72, as a result of energy conversion from fuel or<br>
electrical potential stored in an electrical energy storage device (ESD) 74. The<br>
ESD 74 typically comprises one or more batteries. Other electrical energy and<br>
electrochemical energy storage devices that have the ability to store electric<br>
power and dispense electric power may be used in place of the batteries<br>
without altering the concepts of the present invention. The ESD 74 is<br>
preferably sized based upon factors including regenerative requirements,<br>
application issues related to typical road grade and temperature, and<br>
propulsion requirements such as emissions, power assist and electric range.<br>
The ESD 74 is high voltage DC-coupled to motor control processors MPCA<br><br>
33 and MCPB 22 of transmission power inverter module (TPIM) 19 via DC<br>
lines or transfer conductors 27. Motor control processors MPCA 33 and<br>
MCPB 22 each comprise power inverters and motor controllers configured to<br>
receive motor control commands and control inverter states therefrom for<br>
providing motor drive or regeneration functionality. Each power inverter<br>
comprises an electrical converter that is operable to convert direct electrical<br>
current to alternating electrical current, and alternating electrical current to<br>
direct electrical current. The TPIM 19 is an element of the control system<br>
described hereinafter with regard to Fig. 2. The TPIM 19 communicates with<br>
the first motor/generator 56 by transfer conductors 29, and the TPIM 19<br>
similarly communicates with the second motor/generator 72 by transfer<br>
conductors 31. Electrical current is transferable to or from the ESD 74 in<br>
accordance with whether the ESD 74 is being charged or discharged.<br>
 In motoring control, the respective inverter receives current from the<br>
DC lines and provides AC current to the respective motor over transfer<br>
conductors 29 and 31. In regeneration control, the respective inverter receives<br>
AC current from the motor over transfer conductors 29 and 31 and provides<br>
current to the DC lines 27. The net DC current provided to or from the<br>
inverters determines the charge or discharge operating mode of the electrical<br>
energy storage device 74. Preferably, Motor A 56 and Motor B 72 are three-<br>
phase AC machines and the inverters comprise complementary three-phase<br>
power electronics operable to convert direct electrical current to alternating<br>
electrical current, and alternating electrical current to direct electrical current.<br>
 Referring again to Fig. 1, a drive gear 80 may be presented from the<br>
input member 12. As depicted, the drive gear 80 fixedly connects the input<br>
member 12 to the outer gear member 30 of the first planetary gear set 24, and<br>
the drive gear 80, therefore, receives power from the engine 14 and/or the<br>
motor/generators 56 and/or 72 through planetary gear sets 24 and/or 26. The<br>
drive gear 80 meshingly engages an idler gear 82 which, in turn, meshingly<br>
engages a transfer gear 84 that is secured to one end of a shaft 86. The other<br><br>
end of the shaft 86 may be secured to an auxiliary hydraulic/transmission fluid<br>
pump and/or power take-off ('PTO') unit, designated either individually or<br>
collectively at 88.<br>
 Referring now to Fig. 2, a schematic block diagram of the control<br>
system, comprising a distributed controller architecture, is shown. The<br>
elements described hereinafter comprise a subset of an overall vehicle control<br>
architecture, and are operable to provide coordinated system control of the<br>
powertrain system described herein. The control system is operable to<br>
synthesize pertinent information and inputs, and execute algorithms to control<br>
various actuators to achieve control targets, including such parameters as fuel<br>
economy, emissions, performance, driveability, and protection of hardware,<br>
including batteries of BSD 74 and motors 56, 72. The distributed controller<br>
architecture comprises a plurality of processors and devices, including a<br>
system controller which is referred to herein as hybrid control processor<br>
('HCP') 5, engine control module ('ECM') 23, transmission control module<br>
('TCM') 17, battery pack control module ('BPCM') 21, Accessory Power<br>
Module ('APM') 114, and Motor Control Processors ('MCP') 22, 33. The<br>
MCP preferably comprises first and second motor control processors,<br>
designated as MCPA 33 and MCPB 22. There is a User Interface ('UI') 13<br>
operably connected to a plurality of other devices through which a vehicle<br>
operator typically controls or directs operation of the vehicle and powertrain,<br>
including the transmission 10. Exemplary devices through which a vehicle<br>
operator provides input to the UI 13 include an accelerator pedal, a brake<br>
pedal, transmission gear selector, and, vehicle speed cruise control. Each of<br>
the aforementioned controllers and devices communicate with other<br>
controllers, devices, sensors, and actuators via a high-speed local area network<br>
('LAN') bus, shown generally in Fig. 2 as item 6. The LAN bus 6 allows for<br>
structured communication of control parameters and commands between the<br>
various processors, controllers, and devices. The specific communication<br>
protocol utilized is application-specific. By way of example, one<br><br>
communications protocol is the Society of Automotive Engineers standard<br>
J1939. Other communications protocols are known, and not specifically<br>
relevant to the invention. The LAN bus and appropriate protocols provide for<br>
robust messaging and multi-controller interfacing between the aforementioned<br>
controllers, and other controllers providing functionality such as antilock<br>
brakes, traction control, and vehicle stability.<br>
The system controller HCP 5 provides overarching control of the<br>
hybrid powertrain system, serving to coordinate operation of various devices,<br>
including the ECM 23, TCM 17, MCPA 33, MCPB 22, and BPCM 21. Based<br>
upon various input signals from the UI 13 and the powertrain, the HCP 5<br>
generates various commands, including: an engine torque command, TE_jCMD;<br>
clutch torque commands, TcL_Nfor the various clutches C1, C2, C3, C4 of the<br>
hybrid transmission 10; and motor torque commands, TA_CMD and TB_JCMD» for<br>
the electrical Motors A 56 and B 72, respectively. Functions of the HCP 5<br>
typically include: determining system operating constraints and an optimal<br>
system operating point(s); determining a transmission range state; determining<br>
and controlling a desired engine speed and input speed to the transmission 10;<br>
arbitrating output torque of the powertrain; controlling regeneration of the<br>
ESD 74; determining optimal engine torque and commanding engine torque to<br>
the ECM 23; determining operating state of Engine Start/Stop; commanding<br>
operating state of engine displacement-on-demand, when so equipped;<br>
commanding operating state of a battery relay for the ESD; interpreting and<br>
diagnosing a transmission shift lever position ('PRNDL') range selection<br>
sensor; controlling active driveline damping; and, controlling internal<br>
combustion engine start. The HCP 5 has responsibility to protect and<br>
diagnose system operation, and provide system security by controlling system<br>
torque output and range state.<br><br>
 The first and second motor control processors, designated as MCPA<br>
33 and MCPB 22, each comprise a device operable to control operation of the<br>
corresponding electrical Motor A, B. It preferably includes a pair of power<br>
inverters and motor control processors configured to receive motor control<br>
commands and control inverter states therefrom to provide motor drive or<br>
regeneration functionality. The MCPA 33 and MCPB 22 preferably execute<br>
the following operations: sensing motor and power inverter operation;<br>
receiving motor torque commands, TA_CMD and TB__CMD; controlling engine<br>
compression pulse cancellation, determining motor current command for<br>
Motors A, B; determining limits for Motors A, B and power inverters;<br>
controlling motor current to Motors A, B; determining rotational speeds of<br>
Motors A, B; diagnosing faults in the inverters and motors; and acting to<br>
protect the motors and power inverters. Furthermore, it provides secondary<br>
support for on-board diagnostics (OBD), and system security by controlling<br>
motor torques, TA, TB. The MCPA 33 and MCPB 22 are operable to generate<br>
torque commands for Motors A and B,<br>
TA_CMD And TB_CMD, based upon input<br>
from the HCP 5, which is driven by operator input through UI 13 and system<br>
operating parameters. Individual motor speed signals, NA and NB for Motor A<br>
and Motor B respectively, are derived from the motor phase information or<br>
conventional rotation sensors. MCPA 33 and MCPB 22 determine and<br>
communicate motor speeds, NA and NB, to the HCP 5. The electrical energy<br>
storage device 74 is high-voltage DC-coupled to MCPA 33 and MCPB 22 via<br>
DC lines 27. Electrical current is transferable to or from MCPA 33 and<br>
MCPB 22 in accordance with whether the ESD 74 is being charged or<br>
discharged.<br>
 The ECM 23 comprises a device that is signally and operably<br>
connected to the engine 14 via a plurality of discrete lines, collectively shown<br>
as aggregate line 35. The ECM 23 functions to acquire data from a variety of<br>
sensors and control a variety of actuators, respectively, of the engine 14. The<br>
ECM 23 receives the engine torque command, TE_CMD. from the HCP 5, and<br><br>
generates a desired axle torque, TAXLE_DES, and an indication of actual engine<br>
torque, TE_ACT, which is communicated to the HCP 5. Various other<br>
parameters that may be sensed by ECM 23 include engine coolant<br>
temperature, engine input speed (NE) to shaft 14 leading to the transmission,<br>
manifold pressure, ambient air temperature, and ambient pressure. Various<br>
actuators that may be controlled by the ECM 23 include fuel injectors, ignition<br>
modules, and throttle control modules. Other functions of the ECM 23 can<br>
include interpreting and diagnosing accelerator pedal input, determining axle<br>
torque arbitration, requesting axle torque, determining and communicating<br>
engine limits, determining and communicating engine cost, in terms of fuel<br>
flow. The ECM generates a Powertrain_Crank_Active signal, which it<br>
communicates to the HCP 5. The ECM supports Engine_Start_Stop Mode<br>
operation. The ECM preferably reads temperature from a powertrain<br>
electronics coolant sensor and drives coolant pumps based upon input from the<br>
coolant sensor. The ECM senses various engine inputs, and controls engine<br>
torque and emissions, per the above, by actuating ignition spark, fuel, air<br>
control, displacement-on-demand (when it is mechanized on the engine), and,<br>
executes engine diagnostic routines, including operating as master controller<br>
for execution of on-board diagnostics (OBD).<br>
 The TCM 17 comprises a device that is operably connected to the<br>
transmission 10 and functions to acquire data from a variety of sensors and<br>
provide command signals to the transmission via a plurality of discrete lines<br>
collectively shown as aggregate line 41. Inputs from the TCM 17 to the HCP<br>
5 include clutch torques, TCL_N. for each of the clutches C1, C2, C3, and, C4<br>
and rotational speed, No, of the output shaft 64. The TCM preferably operates<br>
by executing the following tasks: sensing inputs to the transmission;<br>
executing fluid logic valve commands and clutch commands received from the<br>
HCP 5 to control hydraulic systems in the transmission 10 in order to control<br>
the clutches C1, C2, C3, and, C4; interpreting and diagnosing PRNDL range<br>
selection; diagnosing operation of the transmission 10; and, serving as primary<br><br>
controller for execution of transmission OBD. Other actuators and sensors<br>
may be used to provide additional information from the TCM to the HCP for<br>
control purposes.<br>
 The BPCM 21 comprises a device that is signally connected one or<br>
more sensors operable to monitor electrical current or voltage parameters of<br>
the ESD 74 to provide information about the state of the batteries to the HCP<br>
5. Such information includes battery state-of-charge, Bat_SOC, and other<br>
states of the batteries, including voltage, VBAT, and available power, PBAT_MIN<br>
and PBAT_MAX- The BPCM is operable to actuate the battery relay and diagnose<br>
battery state, including state-of-life, and provides secondary support for OBD<br>
systems.<br>
 The APM 114 comprises a device that acts to convert 300 volts from<br>
the ESD to 12 V and 42 V for use in the vehicle, to provide 12 V accessory<br>
power and 42V accessory power. It is operable to convert 12V to 300V to<br>
provide jump assist, and is self-diagnosing.<br>
 Each of the aforementioned devices and processors is preferably a<br>
general-purpose digital computer generally comprising a microprocessor or<br>
central processing unit, read only memory (ROM), random access memory<br>
(RAM), electrically programmable read only memory (EPROM), high speed<br>
clock, analog-to-digital (A/D) and digital-to-analog (D/A) circuitry, and<br>
input/output circuitry and devices (I/O) and appropriate signal conditioning<br>
and buffer circuitry. Each controller has a set of control algorithms,<br>
comprising resident program instructions and calibrations stored in ROM and<br>
executed to provide the respective functions of each computer.<br>
 Algorithms for control and state estimation in each of the devices are<br>
typically executed during preset loop cycles such that each algorithm is<br>
executed at least once each loop cycle. Algorithms stored in the non-volatile<br>
memory devices are executed by one of the central processing units and are<br>
operable to monitor inputs from the sensing devices and execute control and<br>
diagnostic routines to control operation of the respective device, using preset<br><br>
calibrations. Loop cycles are typically executed at regular intervals, for<br>
example each 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 and 100 milliseconds during ongoing<br>
engine and vehicle operation. Alternatively, algorithms may be executed in<br>
response to occurrence of an event.<br>
In response to an operator's action, as captured by the UI 13, the<br>
system controller HCP 5 and one or more of the other devices determine<br>
required transmission output torque, To. Selectively operated components of<br>
the hybrid transmission 10 are appropriately controlled and manipulated to<br>
respond to the operator demand. For example, in the embodiment shown in<br>
Fig. 1 and 2, when the operator has selected a forward drive range and<br>
manipulates either the accelerator pedal or the brake pedal, the HCP 5<br>
determines an output torque request for the transmission based upon input to<br>
the UI 13 which read by the ECM 23. This affects how and when the vehicle<br>
accelerates or decelerates. Final vehicle acceleration is affected by other<br>
factors, including, e.g., road load, road grade, and vehicle mass. The HCP 5<br>
monitors the parametric states of the torque-generative devices, and<br>
determines the output of the transmission required to arrive at the desired<br>
torque output. Under the direction of the HCP 5, the transmission 10 operates<br>
over a range of output speeds from slow to fast in order to meet the operator<br>
demand.<br>
The two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical hybrid<br>
transmission, includes output member 64 which receives output power through<br>
two distinct gear trains within the transmission 10, and operates in several<br>
transmission operating modes, described with reference now to Fig. 1, Table 1<br>
is shown below:<br><br><br>
 The various transmission operating modes described in the table<br>
indicate which of the specific clutches C1, C2, C3, and C4 are engaged or<br>
actuated for each of the operating modes. Additionally, in various<br>
transmission operating modes, Motor A 56 or Motor B 72 may each operate as<br>
electrical motors, designated as MA, MB respectively, and whether motor A<br>
56 is operating as a generator, designated as GA. A first mode, or gear train,<br>
is selected when the torque transfer device 70 is actuated in order to "ground"<br>
the outer gear member 46 of the third planetary gear set 28. A second mode, or<br>
gear train, is selected when the torque transfer device 70 is released and the<br>
torque transfer device 62 is simultaneously actuated to connect the shaft 60 to<br>
the carrier 52 of the third planetary gear set 28. Other factors outside the<br>
scope of the invention affect when the electrical machines 56, 72 operate as<br>
motors and generators, and are not discussed herein.<br>
 The control system, shown in Fig. 2, is operable to provide a range of<br>
transmission output speeds, No, of shaft 64 from relatively slow to relatively<br>
fast within each mode of operation. The combination of two modes with a<br>
slow-to-fast output speed range in each mode allows the transmission 10 to<br>
propel a vehicle from a stationary condition to highway speeds, and meet<br>
various other requirements as previously described. Additionally, the control<br>
system coordinates operation of the transmission 10 so as to allow<br>
synchronized shifts between the modes.<br><br>
 The first and second modes of operation refer to circumstances in<br>
which the transmission functions are controlled by one clutch, i.e. either clutch<br>
C1 62 or C2 70, and by the controlled speed and torque of the<br>
motor/generators 56 and 72. Certain ranges of operation are described below<br>
in which fixed ratios are achieved by applying an additional clutch. This<br>
additional clutch may be clutch C3 73 or C4 75, as shown in the table, above.<br>
[6053] When the additional clutch is applied, fixed ratio of input-to-output<br>
speed of the transmission, i.e. NI/No, is achieved. The rotations of the<br>
motor/generators 56, 72 are dependent on interna] rotation of the mechanism<br>
as defined by the clutching and proportional to the input speed, NN determined<br>
or measured at shaft 12. The motor/generators function as motors or<br>
generators. They are completely independent of engine to output power flow,<br>
thereby enabling both to be motors, both to function as generators, or any<br>
combination thereof. This allows, for instance, during operation in Fixed Ratio<br>
1 that motive power output from the transmission at shaft 64 is provided by<br>
power from the engine and power from Motors A and B, through planetary<br>
gear set 28 by accepting power from the energy storage device 74.<br>
 The transmission operating mode can be switched between Fixed<br>
Ratio operation and Mode operation by activating or deactivating one the<br>
additional clutches during Mode I or Mode II operation. Determination of<br>
operation in fixed ratio or mode control is by algorithms executed by the<br>
control system, and is outside the scope of this invention.<br>
 The modes of operation may overlap the ratio of operation, and<br>
selection depends again on the driver's input and response of the vehicle to<br>
that input. RANGE 1 falls primarily within mode I operation when clutches<br>
C1 70 and C4 75 are engaged. RANGE 2 falls within mode I and mode II<br>
when clutches C2 62 and C1 70 are engaged. A third fixed ratio range is<br>
available primarily during mode II when clutches C2 62 and C4 75 are<br>
engaged, and a fourth fixed ratio range is available during mode II when<br><br>
clutches C2 62 and C3 73 are engaged. It is notable that ranges of operation<br>
for Mode I and Mode II typically overlap significantly.<br>
 Output of the exemplary powertrain system described hereinabove is<br>
constrained due to mechanical and system limitations. The output speed, No,<br>
of the transmission measured at shaft 64 is limited due to limitations of engine<br>
output speed, NE, measured at shaft 18, and transmission input speed, NI,<br>
measured at shaft 12, and speed limitations of the electric motors A and B,<br>
designated as +/- NA, +/- NB. Output torque, T0, of the transmission 64 is<br>
similarly limited due to limitations of the engine input torque, TE, and input<br>
torque, Th measured at shaft 12 after the transient torque damper 20, and<br>
torque limitations (TA_MAX&gt; TA_MW, TB_MAX, TB_MIN) of the motors A and B 56,<br>
72.<br>
 Referring now to Fig. 3, an embodiment of an architecture for a<br>
control system for controlling the powertrain system of Figs. 1 and 2 is shown.<br>

duplex synchronous serial data link permitting direct communication between<br>
the devices, wherein the HCP, as a master device, is operable to communicate<br>
device control data directly to the MCPA or the MCPB. The system controller<br>
HCP 5 directly signally communicates individually to the MCPA 33 and the<br>
MCPB 22 via the first and second SPI buses 110, thus achieving high-speed<br>
communications between the devices without waiting for communications to<br>
occur via the vehicle bus 106 or the hybrid bus 107. Specific details of SPI<br>
communications are known to a skilled practitioner and not discussed in detail<br>
herein. In this embodiment, messages are typically sent from the HCP to the<br>
MCPA and MCPB over the vehicle bus 106 and the hybrid bus 107 each 6.25<br>
millisecond loop.<br><br>
