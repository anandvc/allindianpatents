				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a continous process for the preparation of a carotenoids, retinoids or natural colourants into finely divided pulverous forms which are particular required for colouring foodstuff and animal feeds.<br>
Various processes have been described to prepare a powder containing the active ingredients with a crystallite size less than 1 micron. Most of the processes are well suited to batch processing applications.<br>
For example, US Patent 3,998,753 describes a batch process for the preparation of a water dispersible carotenoid containing powder, wherein the carotenoid has a particle size of less than 1 micron, which process comprises (a) forming a solution of a carotenoid and an antioxidant in a volatile solvent, said solvent being selected from the group consisting of halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons such as chloroform, carbon tetra-chloride and methylene chloride; (b) forming an aqueous solution of sodium lauryl sulfate, a water soluble carrier composition such as e.g. gelatin, a preservative and a stabilizer, and adjusting said solution to a pH of about 10 to 11 and (c) forming an emulsion of the solutions of steps (a) and (b) by mixing at a high speed and high shear; removing the organic solvent and spray drying the resulting emulsion to obtain a carotenoid powder.<br>
In the European Patent Publication EP-0065193 Bl or the corresponding US Patent 4,522,743 a continuous process for the preparation of finely divided carotenoid powders is described, in which the carotenoid has a particle size essentially below 0.5 microns. The carotenoid is dissolved in a volatile, water miscible organic solvent within less than 10 sec. at 50-200°C. The carotenoid is immediately precipitated in colloidally dispersed form from the resulting molecularly dispersed solution by rapid mixing with an aqueous solution of a swellable colloid at 0-50°C. The preparation of the carotenoid solution and the precipitation of the carotenoid are effected continuously in two mixing chambers. The resulting dispersion is freed of solvent and the dispersing medium in a conventional manner. This reference also concerns the preparation of finely divided retinoid powders, whereby the retinoid starting material is processed analogously to the carotenoid, and that the rapid dissolution of the carotenoid or retinoid in the water-miscible solvents is assisted by a heat exchanger.<br><br>
However, for economical and ecological reasons this process has the disadvantage that a large amount of solvent must be used.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a process that overcomes the aforesaid drawback while converting the active ingredient into finely divided pulverous form.<br>
It has now been found that it is possible to provide a pulverous preparation wherein the active ingredient is finely divided by using a water-immiscible organic solvent in a continuous process.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a continuous process for the preparation of a pulverous carotenoid, retinoid or natural colourant preparation, wherein the active ingredient is finely divided, which process comprises the steps of<br>
a)	forming a suspension of the active ingredient in a water-immiscible organic solvent being dimethyl carbonate, ethyl formate, ethyl-, or isopropyl acetate, methyltert, butyl ether or methylene chloride, optionally containing an antioxidant and/or an oil,<br>
b)	feeding the suspension of step a) to a heat exchanger and heating said suspension to 100-250°C, whereby the residence time in the heat exchanger is less than 5 seconds,<br>
c)	rapidly mixing the solution of step b) at a temperature in the range of 20- 100°C with an aqueous solution of a swellable colloid optionally containing a stabilizer,<br>
d)	removing the organic solvent and<br>
e)	converting the dispersion of step d) into a pulverous preparation.<br>
Accordingly the present also invention provides a pulverous carotenoid, retinoid or natural colourant preparation prepared by the above said process and containing from 0.5-25% by weight of the carotenoid, retinoid or natural colourant active ingredient, the particle size of the finely divided active ingredient being less than 1.5 microns.<br>
The term "finely divided" denotes in the scope of the present invention a particle size of less than 1.5 micron, preferably less than 1 micron, more preferably less than 0.4 micron.<br>
The term "active ingredient" denotes in the scope of the present invention carotenoids, retinoids or natural colourants.<br><br>
Carotenoids for the purpose of the present invention in particular include beta-carotene, beta-apo-4"-carotenal, beta-apo-8"-carotenal, beta-apo-12"-carotenal, beta-apo-8"-carotenic acid, astaxanthin, canthaxanthin, zeaxanthin cryptoxanthin, citranaxanthin, lutein, lycopene, torularodin-aldehyde, torularodin-ethylester, neurosporaxanthin-ethylester, zeta-carotene or dehydroplectaniaxanthin. Also included are carotenoids of natural sources. Preferred are beta-carotene, astaxanthin, canthaxanthin, beta-apo-8"-carotenal and lycopene; more preferred is beta-carotene.<br>
Natural colourants for the purpose of the present invention in particular include curcumine, cochineal, carmine, annatto and mixtures thereof.<br>
Preferably the process of the invention is carried out using carotenoids.<br>
The temperature of step b) is preferably 120-180°C, more preferably 140-170°C and the temperature of step c) is preferably 50-80°C.<br>
The residence time in the heat exchanger is preferably 0.5-4 sec, more preferably 1-3 sec.<br>
The term "water-inmiscible organic solvent" denotes in the scope of the present invention an organic solvent having a solubility in water of less than 10% under atmospheric pressure. Suitable water-inmiscible organic solvents for carrying out the continous process according to the invention are halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons such as e.g. chloroform, carbon tetra¬chloride and methylene chloride, water-inmiscible esters such as e.g. carbonic acid dimethylester (dimethyl carbonate), formic acid ethylester (ethyl formate) methyl -, ethyl-, or isopropylacetate; or water-inmiscible ethers such as e.g. methyl-tert. butylether and the like. Preferred are dimethyl carbonat, ethyl formate, ethyl-, or isopropylacetate, methyl-tert. butylether.<br>
The term "swellable colloids" denotes in the scope of the present invention gelatin, carbohydrates such as e.g. starch or starch derivatives, dextrin, pectin, gum arabic, octenylbutanedioate amylodextrin (CAPSUL™), milk protein such as e.g. casein and vegetable protein as well as mixtures thereof. Preferred are fish gelatin or starch derivatives.<br>
To increase the stability of the carotenoid it is advantageous to add an antioxidant being selected from the group consisting of ascorbic acid, ascorbylpalmitate, dl-alpha tocopherol, mixed tocopherols, lecithine,<br><br>
butylhydroxytoluol, butyl-4-methoxyphenol and combinations of these compounds.<br>
The antioxidant can be added either to the matrix solution or to the carotenoid solution or to both solutions. A preferred antioxidant for the carotenoid solution is dl-alpha tocopherol and for the aqueous phase solution it is ascorbyl palmitate.<br>
It may be further advantageous to dissolve an oil in the carotenoid suspension, preferrably corn oil.<br>
Reference is now made to the accompanying drawing Fig. 1 where a flow chart suitable for carrying out the process in accordance with the instant invention is diagrammatically illustrated. The whole process has to be carried out continously.<br>
The flow chart is explained as follows:<br>
An aqueous matrix containing a swellable colloid and optionally a stabilizer is prepared in Kettle 1.<br>
A suspension of a carotenoid in the selected solvent is prepared in Kettle 2. The suspension may further contain an antioxidant and an oil.<br>
The carotenoid suspension is fed by pump 6 to the heat exchanger 4. The flow rate is adjusted according to the desired residence time which is necessary to dissolve the carotenoid in the solvent at a given temperature. In the heat exchanger 4 the carotenoid suspension is heated to 100 to 250 °C , preferably to 120 to 180 °C, more preferably to 140 to 170°C and the carotene is solubilized. The heating can be done either indirectly through the heat exchanger or directly by mixing with steam at 8. The residence time in the heat exchanger is less than 5 sec, preferably 1 to 3 sec.<br>
The matrix solution of Kettle 1 is fed by pump 7 to Kettle 3. The flow rate depends on the suspension flow rate and the required emulsion composition. In Kettle 3 the carotenoid suspension and the matrix are mixed and emulsified by using a rotor stator homogenizer to the desired particle size of the inner phase of approx. 150-400 nm. As a result of the mixing the temperature is lowered to the range 20 to 100 °C.<br><br>
The dispersion obtained passes to a second neat exchanger 5 whereby the dispersion is cooled. The pressure is released to atmospheric pressure by pressure control.<br>
The solvent is removed using conventional methods e.g. by evaporation. A pulverous composition can be isolated from the resulting dispersion by conventional methods, for example by spray drying or by using powder catch technique.<br>
Using this invention it is possible to manufacture powders which cover very wide range of color.<br>
The manner in which the process of the invention may readily be carried out is illustrated by the following examples. The color intensity was measured in an aqueous dispersion containing 5 ppm carotenoid and given by the calculated extinction of 1% solution in a 1 cm cuvette (El/1-value). The average particle size has been measured by Coulter Particle Analyzer N4S. The carotenoid content was measured by UV-spectroscopy.<br>
