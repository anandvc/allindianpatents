CIRCULAR      KNITTING      MACHINE,      PARTICULARLY      FOR<br>
PRODUCING ITEMS OF CLOTHING WITH THREE-DB4ENSIONAL<br>
SHAPES<br>
Technical Field<br>
The  present   invention   relates   to   a   circular  knitting   machine,<br>
particularly for producing items of clothing with three-dimensional shapes.<br>
Background Art<br>
Circular knitting machines with a diameter substantially comprised<br>
between 7 and 24 inches are known. In recent years, these machines have<br>
become widespread as a consequence of the increasing demand for items of<br>
clothing, such as for example jerseys, light jerseys, bodysuits, briefs, bras or<br>
the like, provided without lateral seams, and as a consequence of the<br>
possibility to provide directly on these machines finishing work, such as for<br>
example borders, shoulder straps or others, without having to resort to<br>
subsequent operations.<br>
In the production of certain items of clothing, such as for example<br>
bodysuits and bras, it must be possible to provide three-dimensional shapes<br>
aimed at improving the fit and aesthetics of the item of clothing. This<br>
requirement is currently met by means of solutions that generally consist in<br>
varying the tightness of the knitting and/or in making a set of needles knit<br>
for a preset number of courses of knitting while the other needles remain<br>
unused, optionally using particularly elastic yarns. However, these<br>
refinements do no fully meet the requirements, since a variation in the<br>
tightness of the knitting causes a variation in the degree of sheerness of the<br>
item of clothing, whereas making a set of needles knit while the other<br>
needles are inactive entails trimming the yarn knitted by the needles that are<br>
then excluded from knitting, with negative effects on the fit of the item of<br>
clothing.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The aim of the present invention is to solve the problems described<br><br>
WO 2004/097092	PCT/EP2004/004475<br>
n<br>
above by providing a circular knitting machine that allows to obtain items of<br>
clothing with three-dimensional shapes without necessarily resorting to a<br>
variation in the tightness of the knitting and without forming portions of<br>
courses of knitting with final trimming of the yarns used to produce said<br>
course portions.<br>
Within this aims an object of the invention is to provide a machine<br>
that allows to produce reinforcement gussets and shapes at preset regions of<br>
the article to be produced according to a preset knitting program.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a circular machine that is<br>
also capable of performing intarsia knitting, i.e., designs with colored<br>
patterns without floated yarns on the reverse side of the knitting.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a machine that is<br>
. extremely versatile and can perform a wide range of types of knitting.<br>
This aim and these and other objects that will become better apparent<br>
hereinafter are achieved by a circular knitting machine, comprising a footing<br>
that supports a needle cylinder that can rotate about its own axis, which is<br>
orientated substantially vertically, said needle cylinder having a diameter<br>
that is substantially comprised between 7 and 24 inches, multiple axial slots<br>
being formed on the outer lateral surface of the needle cylinder, each slot<br>
accommodating a needle, means for actuating the needles being provided<br>
which interact with said needles during the rotation of the needle cylinder<br>
about its own axis for the actuation of the needles along the corresponding<br>
axial slot of the needle cylinder so that the needles form knitting with at<br>
least one yarn dispensed to the needles at at least one drop or feed of the<br>
machine, characterized in that said needle cylinder can be rotationally<br>
actuated about its own axis in both directions of rotation and in that said<br>
needle actuation means are suitable to allow the needles to form knitting in<br>
both directions of rotation of the needle cylinder about its own axis at at<br>
least one drop or feed of the machine.<br>

Ways to carrying out the Invention<br>
With reference to the figures, the circular knitting machine according<br>
to the invention, generally designated by the reference numeral 1 and shown<br>
only schematically and partially, comprises, like known types of machine, a<br><br>
WO 2004/097092	PCT/EP2004/004475<br>
4<br>
footing, not shown for the sake of simplicity, which supports a needle<br>
cylinder 2, which can rotate with respect to the footing about its own axis<br>
2aB which is orientated substantially vertically. The needle cylinder 2 has a<br>
diameter that is substantially comprised between 7 and 24 inches, and<br>
multiple axial slots 3 are formed on its outer lateral surface; each slot<br>
accommodates a needle 4.<br>
The machine comprises means for actuating the needles 4, which are<br>
described in greater detail hereinafter and interact with the needles 4 during<br>
the rotation of the needle cylinder 2 about its own axis 2a in order to actuate<br>
the needles 4 along the corresponding axial slot 3 so that the needles 4 form<br>
knitting with at least one yam, which is dispensed to the needles 4 at at least<br>
one feed or drop 5, which is arranged laterally to the axis 2a and at which<br>
appropriately provided yarn fingers 6 are positioned.<br>
According to the invention, the needle cylinder 2 can be actuated so<br>
as to rotate about its own axis 2a in both directions of rotation, and the<br>
means for actuating the needles 4 are suitable to allow the needles 4 to form<br>
knitting in both directions of rotation of the needle cylinder 2 about its own<br>
axis 2a at at least one drop 5.<br>
Depending on the knitting requirements, the needle cylinder 2 can be<br>
actuated with a continuous motion in one direction of rotation or in the<br>
opposite direction or with an alternating (or oscillating) motion about its<br>
own axis 2a.<br>
For the actuation of the needle cylinder 2 with a rotary motion about<br>
its own axis 2a, it is possible to use an electric motor of a known type,<br>
which allows to reverse the rotation of its output shaft, or said reversal of<br>
the rotary motion can be achieved by means of a transmission that is<br>
interposed between the motor and the needle cylinder 2.<br>
The needle cylinder 2 can have, in a per se known manner, means for<br>
controlling its angular position around the axis 2a, for example devices such<br>
as encoders or the like, so as to allow to control the position of the various<br><br>
WO 2004/097092	PCT/EP2004/004475<br>
5<br>
needles 4 around the axis 2a during the rotation of the cylinder 2.<br>
The machine is preferably provided with a control and actuation<br>
element of the programmable electronic type, which supervises the<br>
operation of the various elements of the machine so that it can perform<br>
knitting according to preset programs.<br>
Preferably, the machine according to the invention has four drops or<br>
feeds 5, which are angularly mutually spaced around the axis 2a of the<br>
needle cylinder 2.<br>
Preferably, the means for actuating the needles 4 are provided so as to<br>
allow the needles 4 to form knitting in both directions of rotation of the<br>
needle cylinder 2 about its own axis 2a at all the drops 5.<br>
Figures 1 to 4, described in detail hereinafter, are flat projection<br>
views of a portion of the cam box of the machine. The illustrated portion<br>
refers to the portion that relates to a little more than one drop 5, and<br>
preferably this configuration of the cams is repeated as regards the other<br>
drops of the machine.<br>
The means for actuating the needles 4 comprise, for each needle 4, a<br>
sub-needle 7, which is arranged below the corresponding needle 4 in the<br>
same axial slot 3 of the needle cylinder 2. The sub-needle 7 is connected<br>
bilaterally, in its motion along the corresponding axial slot 3, i.e., parallel to<br>
the axis 2a of the needle cylinder 2S to the overlying needle 4, and has, along<br>
its longitudinal extension, a heel 7a, which is orientated radially with<br>
respect to the needle cylinder 2. The bilateral connection between the needle<br>
4 and the sub-needle 7 is achieved by means of a particular geometric<br>
coupling between the upper end of the sub-needle 7 and the lower end of the<br>
needle 4. This coupling, in addition to providing said bilateral connection,<br>
allows the sub-needle 7 to oscillate on a radial plane of the needle cylinder 2<br>
in order to pass from an active position, in which it is extracted radially with<br>
its heel 7a from the corresponding axial slot 3 of the needle cylinder 2, to an<br>
inactive position, in which it is  embedded with  its heel  7a in the<br><br>
WO 2004/097092	PCT/EP2004/004475<br>
6<br>
corresponding axial slot 3.<br>
Sub-needle actuation cams, generally designated by the reference<br>
numeral 8, face and lie around the outer lateral surface of the needle<br>
cylinder 2, at a level that corresponds to the level of the heels 7a of the sub-<br>
needles 7, are rigidly coupled to the footing of the machine as regards rotary<br>
motion about the axis 2a, and define paths that are engaged by the heels 7a<br>
of the sub-needles 7 when they are in the active position and vice versa are<br>
not engaged by the heels 7a of the sub-needles 7 that are in the inactive<br>
position. The paths defined by the actuation cams 8 of the sub-needles 7 are<br>
shaped so as to force or allow the sub-needles 7, the heels 7a of which<br>
engage said paths, an upward or downward motion along the corresponding<br>
a. _al slot 3 of the needle cylinder 2 as a consequence of the rotation of the<br>
needle cylinder 2 about the axis 2a with respect to said cams 8.<br>
The needle 4 also has, along its longitudinal extension, a heel 4a that<br>
lies radially with respect to the needle cylinder 2 and can engage paths<br>
defined by needle actuation cams, generally designated by the reference<br>
numeral 9 and rigidly coupled to the footing of the machine as regards<br>
rotary motion about the axis 2a. Said paths are shaped so as to force or<br>
allow the needles 4, the heels 4a of which engage said paths, an upward or<br>
downward motion along the corresponding axial slot 3 of the needle<br>
cylinder 2 as a consequence of the rotation of the needle cylinder 2 about<br>
the axis 2a with respect to the cams 9.<br>
The means for actuating the needles 4 further comprise actuation<br>
means that act on command on the sub-needle 7 in order to produce its<br>
transition from the inactive position to the active position or vice versa.<br>
Said means for actuating the sub-needle 7 comprise, for each sub-<br>
needle 7, a further actuation element 10, which is arranged in each one of<br>
the axial slots 3 below the sub-needle 7 and can move on command along<br>
the axial slot 3, i.e., parallel to the axis 2a of the needle cylinder 2, in order<br>
to interact with the lower end of the sub-needle 7 and produce its transition<br><br>
WO 2004/097092	PCT/EP2004/004475<br>
7<br>
or retention in the inactive position or in the active position.<br>
The actuation element 10 comprises a selector 11, which is provided,<br>
along its longitudinal extension, with at least one heel lla, lib that is<br>
extended radially with respect to the needle cylinder 2. In the illustrated<br>
embodiment, the selector 11 is provided with two heels, respectively a lower<br>
heel lla and an upper heel lib, which are mutually spaced along the<br>
longitudinal extension of the selector 11.<br>
The selector 11 can oscillate on a radial plane with respect to the<br>
needle cylinder 2 in order to pass from, an active position, in which it<br>
protrudes radially with its lower heel lla from the corresponding axial slot<br>
3, to an inactive position, in which it is embedded with its lower heel 1 la in<br>
the corresponding axial slot 3.<br>
The upper heel lib is constantly extracted from the corresponding<br>
axial slot 3.<br>
Selector actuation cams, generally designated by the reference<br>
numeral 12, are arranged so as to face and lie around the outer lateral<br>
surface of needle cylinder 2 at a level that corresponds to the level of the<br>
selectors 11, and are rigidly coupled to the footing of the machine as regards<br>
rotary motion about the axis 2a. The selector actuation cams 12 define paths<br>
that can be engaged by the upper heel lib and by the lower heel 1 la when it<br>
is in the active position. These paths are shaped so as to force or allow the<br>
selectors 11, the heels lla, lib of which engage said paths, an upward or<br>
downward motion along the corresponding axial slot 3 of the needle<br>
cylinder 2 as a consequence of the rotation of the needle cylinder 2 about<br>
the axis 2a with respect to the cams 12.<br>
The upper heel 1 lb, which is constantly extracted from the<br>
corresponding axial slot 3, is used mainly to actuate the lowering of the<br>
selector 11 by means of a part of the selector actuation cams 12.<br>
The selectors 11 have, in a per se known manner, along their<br>
longitudinal extension, one or more selection tabs lie, on which selection<br><br>
WO 2004/097092	PCT/EP2004/004475<br>
8<br>
devices 43a, 43b, 43c, 43d that face the outer lateral surface of the needle<br>
cylinder 2 act on command in order to produce the transition of the<br>
corresponding selector 11 from the active position to the inactive position.<br>
Transition of the selectors 11 from the inactive position to the active<br>
position can be achieved in a manner similar to what occurs for oscillating<br>
selectors in known types of machine, for example by virtue of extraction<br>
cams 13, which are arranged proximate to the lower end of the needle<br>
cylinder 2 and act on the lower end of the selectors 11. The selection<br>
devices, as well as the extraction cams 13, are arranged upstream of each<br>
drop 5 of the machine along the direction of rotation of the needle cylinder 2<br>
about its own axis 2a with respect to the cam box.<br>
The lower end of the sub-needle 7 is conveniently shaped<br>
complementarily with respect to the upper end of the actuation element 10,<br>
so that a movement of the actuation element 10 along the corresponding<br>
axial slot 3 of the needle cylinder 2 produces the transition of the sub-needle<br>
7 from the inactive position to the active position or vice versa.<br>
Conveniently, the lower end of the sub-needle 7 has a forked shape,<br>
in which a first prong 14a protrudes downward with respect to the second<br>
prong 14b.<br>
Furthermore the first prong 14a is closer to the bottom, i.e., to the<br>
wall directed toward the axis 2a, of the corresponding axial slot 3, than the<br>
second prong 14b. The first prong 14a can be engaged by an upper portion<br>
of the actuation element 10 in order to move or stably retain the sub-needle<br>
7 in its inactive position, while the second prong 14b can be engaged by the<br>
upper portion of the actuation element 10 in order to move or stably retain<br>
the sub-needle 7 in the active position.<br>
Furthermore, the upper portion of the actuation element 10 can be<br>
inserted between the two prongs 14a, 14b of the lower end of the sub-needle<br>
for the very purpose of reinforcing .the retention of the sub-needle 7 in the<br>
active position.<br><br>
WO 2004/097092	PCT/EP2004/004475<br>
9<br>
Conveniently, the actuation element 10 comprises, in addition to the<br>
selector 11, a pusher 15, which is accommodated so that it can slide within<br>
the corresponding axial slot 3 of the needle cylinder 2 between the selector<br>
11 and the sub-needle 7.<br>
In practice, the upper portion of the actuation element 10 that engages<br>
the lower end of the sub-needle 7 is constituted by the upper portion of the<br>
pusher 15.<br>
The pusher 15 has, along its longitudinal extension, a heel 15a that<br>
protrudes from the corresponding axial slot 3 of the needle cylinder 2 and<br>
can engage paths formed by pusher actuation cams, generally designated by<br>
the reference numeral 16, which are rigidly coupled to the footing of the<br>
machine as regards rotation about the axis 2a. The paths defined by the<br>
actuation cams 16 of the pushers are shaped so as to force or allow the<br>
pushers 15, the heels 15a of which engage said paths, an upward or<br>
downward motion along the corresponding axial slot 3 of the needle<br>
cylinder 2 as a consequence of the rotation of the needle cylinder 2 about<br>
the axis 2a with respect to the cams 16.<br>
The upper portion of each pusher 15 has, in a region that is spaced<br>
downward from the upper end of said pusher 15, a first region 17, which<br>
forms an inclined plane with respect to the longitudinal extension of the<br>
corresponding axial slot 3 and can engage a corresponding region 18 that<br>
forms an inclined plane and is provided at the lower end of the first prong<br>
14a of the fork of the sub-needle 7, in order to achieve the transition of the<br>
sub-needle 7 from the active position to the inactive position as a<br>
consequence of the downward movement of the pusher 15 along the<br>
corresponding axial slot 3 of the needle cylinder 2.<br>
The upper portion of each pusher 15 further has, at its upper end, a<br>
second region 19. which forms an inclined plane with respect to the<br>
longitudinal extension of the corresponding axial slot 3 and can engage a<br>
corresponding region 20, which forms an inclined plane and is provided at<br><br>
WO 2004/097092	PCT/EP2004/004475<br>
10<br>
the lower end of the second prong 14b of the fork of the sub-needle 7, in<br>
order to achieve the transition of the sub-needle 7 from the inactive position<br>
to the active position as a consequence of the upward movement of the<br>
pusher 15 along the corresponding axial slot 3 of the needle cylinder 2.<br>
At the fork of the lower end of the sub-needles 7, the axial slots 3<br>
have, on their bottom, a recessed region 25 for containing said fork and for<br>
allowing the oscillation of the sub-needle 7. Optionally, the upper part of<br>
said recessed region 25 may be shallower than the remaining part, so as to<br>
form a support for the forked region at least in the condition of maximum<br>
lifting of the sub-needle 7 that retains it stably in the active position.<br>
The paths defined by the selector actuation cams 12 have, ahead of<br>
each drop 5 along the direction of rotation of the needle cylinder 2 about the<br>
axis 2a with respect to the cam box, a first rising portion 21 and a second<br>
rising portion 22, in which the peak is higher than the peak of the first rising<br>
portion 21 in order to produce lifting respectively up to a tuck-stitch lifting<br>
level and to a drop-stitch lifting level for the overlying needle 4. The rising<br>
portions 21 and 22 are meant to be engaged by the lower heel lla of the<br>
selectors 11 in the active position.<br>
Ahead of each drop or feed 5 of the machine along the direction of<br>
rotation of the needle cylinder 2 about its own axis 2a with respect to the<br>
cam box, there are four selection devices: two of said devices are located<br>
between the first rising portion 21 and the second rising portion 22.<br>
Preferably, the knitting forming cams, also known as lowering cams,<br>
i.e., the cams that produce the descent of the needles after engaging the yarn<br>
at a drop, in the machine according to the invention, are part of the actuation<br>
cams 8 of the sub-needles 7. More particularly, at at least one drop and<br>
preferably at each drop there are two mutually opposite lowering cams 23<br>
and 24 to produce the lowering of the needles after engaging the yarn at the<br>
drop being considered, to be used respectively in rotary motion in one<br>
direction of the needle cylinder 2 or in the opposite direction.<br><br>
WO 2004/097092	PCT/EP2004/004475<br>
II<br>
The lowering cams 23 and 24 can be movable on command, in a per<br>
se known manner, parallel to the axis 2a in order to vary the tightness of the<br>
knitting.<br>
In practice, in the machine according to the invention there is<br>
preferably an arrangement and a configuration of the needle actuation cams<br>
93 of the sub-needle actuation cams 8, of the pusher actuation cams 16 and<br>
of the selector actuation cams 12 that is sjanmetrical vsith respect to a radial<br>
plane of the needle cylinder that passes through a drop or feed. A similar<br>
symmetry also occurs in the arrangement of the selection devices 43 a, 43b,<br>
43 c, 43 d. This allows to actuate the needle cylinder 2 with a rotary motion<br>
about its own axis 2a equally in one direction or in the opposite direction.<br>
The machine is completed with the elements that are usually present<br>
in circular knitting machines of this type, such as for example sinkers, fabric<br>
tensioning devices, various control systems, et cetera.<br>
Optionally, the machine can be equipped with needles 4, sub-needles<br>
7 and pushers 15 that have mutually different heel lengths.<br>
Merely by way of example, Figures 1 to 4 illustrate four different<br>
operating conditions of a needle of the machine according to the invention.<br>
The direction of rotation of the needle cylinder 2 in the various figures is<br>
indicated by the arrow 30. The portions of the paths of the heels of the<br>
various elements in the active position have been shown by means of solid<br>
bars, while the portions of the paths of the heels of the various elements in<br>
the inactive position have been shown by means of broken lines. The needle<br>
4, the sub-needle 7, the pusher 15 and the selector 11 have been shown,<br>
laterally with respect to the cam box portion, turned through 90‹ in a merely<br>
exemplifying position, since the position of these elements can vary<br>
according to the imparted actuation, as described below.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates the condition in which the needle is excluded from<br>
knitting at a drop or feed 5 of the machine. To achieve this condition, the<br>
selector 11 of the needle 4 being considered is retained in the inactive<br><br>
WO 200-1/097092	PCT/EP2004/004475<br>
12<br>
position by virtue of the selection devices. In this manner, the pusher 15,<br>
ahead of the drop being considered, is first lowered together with the sub-<br>
needle 7 and then returned to the lowermost position., causing the transition<br>
of the sub-needle 7 to the inactive position. La this manner, the<br>
corresponding needle 4 passes with its head below the lowering plane of the<br>
sinkers of the machine.<br>
It should be noted that in this operating condition the heel 7a of the<br>
sub-needle 7 does not engage the lowering cams 23, 24, thus avoiding even<br>
small movements of the needle excluded from knitting, which occur in<br>
known types of machine and cause accidental breakage of the fabric.when<br>
the needles that are excluded from knitting at the feed being considered<br>
carry knitting formed at other feeds of the machine.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates the actuation of a needle 4 for forming a drop<br>
stitch.<br>
In this case, the selector 11 of the needle 4 being considered is<br>
retained or moved into the active position by means of the selection devices<br>
so that its lower heel lla engages both the rising portion 21 and the rising<br>
portion 22 of the path defined by the cams 12. In this manner, the pusher 15,<br>
after being lifted by the upward motion of the selector 11 engaged with the<br>
first rising portion 21 and assisted by a cam 31 of the actuation cams 16 of<br>
said pusher 15, is lowered by a cam 32 that again belongs to the cams 16<br>
and causes the momentary transition of the sub-needle 7 into the inactive<br>
position, in order to allow it to move beyond the lowering cam 23 without<br>
engaging it. The additional lifting produced by the engagement of the<br>
pusher 15 with the cam 33, which again belongs to the actuation cams 16 of<br>
the pusher 15, and of the selector with the rising portion 22, produces the<br>
lifting of the needle 4 up to the point where the previously formed loop of<br>
knitting is dropped onto the stem of the needle 4 before the needle 4 takes<br>
. the yarn dispensed at the drop being considered and begins a new descent.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates the actuation of a needle to form a tuck stitch.<br><br>
WO 2004/097092	PCT/EP2O04/004475<br>
13<br>
In this case, the selector 11, by way of the selection devices, is<br>
engaged only with the rising portion 21. In this manner, the pusher 15<br>
behaves as in Figure 2, except that at the drop 5 it does not receive the<br>
further upward motion that would be produced by the engagement of the<br>
selector 11 with the cam 22. For this reason, the needle 4 is raised to a lesser<br>
extent, and the loop of knitting is not dropped onto the stem of the needle 4<br>
before taking a new 3rarn at the drop or feed being considered, but remains<br>
in the hook of the needle 4, which forms a new loop of knitting.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates the actuation of a needle to form a floated stitch.<br>
In this case, the actuation of the various elements is similar to the one<br>
described with reference to Figure 2, except that a movable cam 35 is<br>
inserted so as to act between the pusher actuation cams 16, causing a greater<br>
lifting of the needle 4 before it reaches the drop 5. Said greater lifting of the<br>
needle 4 has the effect of causing the transfer of the previously formed loop<br>
of knitting onto the stem of the needle 4 below the latch. In this condition,<br>
the needle 4 can then be actuated, by virtue of the selection device 43 d, so<br>
as to reach a drop-stitch level, or can be retained at a tuck-stitch level. These<br>
two levels of lifting of the needle 4 can be used to make the needle engage<br>
different yarns dispensed at the drop 5S for example in order to make it<br>
engage two yarns when performing drop-stitch lifting and a single yam<br>
when performing tuck-stitch lifting. Figure 4 illustrates the lifting of the<br>
needle 4 to the drop-stitch level.<br>
It should be noted that in the machine according to the invention, the<br>
needle actuation means, constituted by the sub-needles, pushers and<br>
selectors, and the arrangement and distribution of the functions of the<br>
actuation cams of these elements allow to have as many as four selection<br>
points, two for each direction of rotation of the needle cylinder about its<br>
own axis, at each feed of the machine, with selection devices that can be<br>
arranged at the same vertical elevation.<br>
Furthermore, the set of needle actuation means allows to contain<br><br>
WO 2004/097092	PCT/EP2004/004475<br>
14<br>
considerably the height of the needle cylinder and therefore to contain the<br>
inertia of the needle cylinder, allowing its actuation with an alternating<br>
rotary motion, even at relatively high speeds, about its own axis.<br>
The possibility to rotationally actuate the needle cylinder in both<br>
directions of rotation and in particular the possibility to actuate the needle<br>
cylinder with an alternating rotary motion about its own axis allows to<br>
produce without problems three-dimensional shapes on the tubular articles<br>
that can produced with the machine, and to produce reinforced regions<br>
without varying the tightness of the knitting and without having to produce<br>
portions of courses of knitting to be trimmed.<br>
In alternating motion, for producing contoured pouches, it is possible<br>
to perform knitting with progressive increases and decreases of the active<br>
needles simply by using the needle selection possibilities offered by the<br>
machine with adequate prograrnming of the operation of the selection<br>
devices.<br>
In addition to these possibilities, the machine according to the<br>
invention is capable of producing intarsia knitting, plated fabrics, Jacquard<br>
knitting on three technical tracks, striped fabrics, tuck-stitch knitting and<br>
floated-stitch knitting.<br>
In practice it has been found that the machine according to the<br>
invention fully achieves the intended aim, since it is capable of producing<br>
articles with three-dimensional shapes without necessarily resorting to<br>
variations in the tightness of the knitting and without requiring the<br>
production of additional course portions with yarn trimming. The machine<br>
according to the invention also allows to perform, intarsia knitting, i.e.,<br>
knitting with colored designs without floated yarns on the reverse side.<br>
The machine according to the invention is therefore capable of<br>
producing items of clothing of superior quality with respect to what can be<br>
achieved with circular knitting machines of a conventional type.<br>
The machine thus conceived is susceptible of numerous modifications<br><br>
WO 2004/097092	PCT/EP2004/004475<br>
15<br>
and variations, all of which are within the scope of the appended claims;<br>
moreover, all the details ma)' be replaced with other technically equivalent<br>
elements.<br>
In practice, the materials used may be any according to requirements<br>
and to the state of the art.<br>
