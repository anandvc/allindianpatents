				<td>STEROID HORMONE PRODUCTS AND METHODS<br>
FOR PREPARING THEM<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to steroid hormone products comprising at least<br>
one steroid active ingredient mixed with an excipient and having improved<br>
dissolution and release rate properties. More particularly, the invention provides an<br>
oral contraception product having an improved dissolution profile. The invention<br>
further relates to methods for making such steroid hormone products, either with or<br>
without the use of solvents.<br>
As used herein, the term "steroid hormone product" is a physically discrete<br>
unit suitable as a unitary dosage for a human host. The product contains a<br>
predetermined quantity of at least one steroid active ingredient effective to produce a<br>
desired effect. Examples, of such products are tablets, capsules, caplets, pills or<br>
discrete quantities of powder.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Oral contraceptives first became available in the early 1960"s. Since then, a<br>
number of regimens for controlling ovulation and contraception by the administration<br>
of hormones have become known and are readily available. Oral contraceptive<br>
formulations typically contain an estrogen and a progestin. In addition to these<br>
steroid active ingredients, the formulation may contain an excipient including<br>
various grades of lactose, additives and fillers such as pregelatinized starch and<br>
magnesium stearate, and a colorant such as an aluminum oxide lake.<br>
Solvent-based processes, referred to herein as "wet processiing" have been<br>
commonly employed for many years to make commercial quantities of steroid<br>
hormone products, such as oral contraceptives containing steroid active ingredients,<br>
According to one well-known process, an active ingredient, such as a steroid<br>
hormone, is dissolved in an appropriate volatile solvent and sprayed onto a bed of a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable excipient powder until a desired concentration of the<br>
active ingredient per unit weight of powder is achieved. In general, the solvent<br>
employed is compatible with the active ingredient and the chosen excipient and can<br>
be removed under conditions that will not result in the degradation of the active<br>
ingredient. Particularly suitable solvents for use with steroid hormone active<br>
ingredients include alcohols such as methanol, ethanol and propanol, ketones such<br>
as acetone, hydrocarbons such as ethylene chloride and chloroform, and mixtures of<br>
one or more of these solvents with water. The solution is typically sprayed onto the<br>
bed of excipient powder in a suitable processor, such as a V-blender with an<br>
intensifier bar or a fluid bed processor. The solution and powder are then thoroughly<br>
mixed in the processor to ensure uniform dispersion of the active ingredient in the<br>
excipient. After mixing, the solvent is removed by the application of heat and/or<br>
vacuum to provide a dry mixture.<br>
In an alternative wet processing technique, referred to by those skilled in the<br>
art as high sheer wet granulation, the solvent is not sprayed onto the excipient but is,<br>
instead, mixed directly with the excipient powder in a high shear blender.<br>
Subsequent to mixing, the solvent is removed as described above to provide a dry<br>
mixture.<br>
Wet processing provides a number of advantages, including powder blends<br>
that have a uniform distribution of active ingredient and that suffer only minimal<br>
segregation under usual conditions of storage and handling. Steroid hormone<br>
products prepared from these blends typically exhibit excellent content uniformity.<br>
A major disadvantage of these solvent-based processes is that<br>
environmentally objectionable organic solvents are generally required in those cases<br>
where the steroid active ingredient has poor water solubility. Such solvents often<br>
pose safety hazards during handling, in addition to the hazards they present when<br>
they are released into the environment. Increasingly, health regulatory authorities<br>
are objecting to the use of such solvents due to their toxicity and mutagenicity.<br>
Accordingly, a dry granulation or direct compression process would be<br>
preferable for active ingredients that would generally otherwise require the use of an<br>
organic solvent. Such dry granulation or direct compression processes will be<br>
referred to herein as "dry processing". Dry processing generally involves fewer steps<br>
than solvent-based wet processing and does not require elevated temperatures that<br>
can reduce the potency of temperature-sensitive active ingredients. Dry processing<br>
is also especially suitable for products that include steroid hormones sensitive to the<br>
moisture associated with wet processing via aqueous granulation. The absence of<br>
expensive organic solvents and the required evaporation steps also makes dry<br>
processing economically more attractive.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,382,434 has proposed pharmaceutical preparations<br>
containing steroids (e.g., progestin and/or estrogen) and an excipient (e.g., lactose)<br>
made without the use of solvents. According to the "434 patent, at least 80% of the<br>
steroid must be bound to the excipient and the excipient must have a low "demixing<br>
potential," which is a measure of content uniformity. The excipient is mixed with the<br>
steroid until a uniform mixture is obtained. However, the "434 patent is silent as to<br>
release characteristics of these compositions and teaches only a mechanical<br>
interaction during the mixing operation.<br>
As those skilled in the art recognize, known steroid hormone products present<br>
a number of disadvantages that are not addressed by either wet or dry processing<br>
techniques. Steroids exist in various polymorphic forms, defined here to include<br>
crystalline, amorphous and solvate forms. In the case of wet processing, the inability<br>
to identify the polymorphic form(s) of the potent steroid(s) that exists in a steroid<br>
hormone product following removal of the deposited organic solvent is a potential<br>
concern both from a physical/chemical stability prospective and from a<br>
biopharmaceutical prospective. Unfortunately, known methods of dry processing do<br>
not completely eliminate the potential existence of polymorphic forms.<br>
In addition, steroid hormone products prepared by either wet or dry<br>
processing methods may present bioavailability problems. Before a drug that is<br>
orally administered as a solid can be absorbed, it must first dissolve in the<br>
gastrointestinal medium, and then it must be transported in the dissolved state<br>
across the gastrointestinal mucosa into the blood stream. As a surrogate test to<br>
predict bioavailability prior to commercial release of a drug product, regulatory<br>
authorities routinely require that at least 80% of the active ingredient in the product<br>
dissolve within 60 minutes in a "physiologically relevant" medium, i.e., a dissolution<br>
medium for in-vitro testing. Low dose steroid formulations prepared by known<br>
methods of either wet or dry processing have exhibited an undesirable variability in<br>
release rate, as measured by dissolution rate techniques in an aqueous medium<br>
containing a surfactant. Notably, upon scale up, formulations containing low dose<br>
steroids manufactured by dry processing and intended for use as oral contraceptives<br>
routinely had slower dissolution rates or at least suffered from a poorly reproducible<br>
dissolution profile.<br>
Steroid hormones such as estrogen and progestin are also employed for<br>
hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Steroid hormone products used for HRT may<br>
contain up to a ten fold higher amount of estrogen and, typically, a lesser amount of<br>
progestin than oral contraceptives. Consequently, it is anticipated that such products<br>
may experience similar problems related to dissolution. Accordingly, it would also be<br>
desirable to reduce or eliminate such problems in the case of HRT steroid hormone<br>
products.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
In accordance with the invention, a steroid hormone product having an<br>
improved dissolution profile and release rate profile is provided. The product<br>
comprises at least one steroid hormone in substantially non-crystalline form in<br>
admixture with primary excipient, wherein the excipient stabilizes the steroid in its<br>
substantially non-crystalline form. The hormone products taught by the invention are<br>
characterized by highly favorable dissolution properties. The preferred excipient is<br>
lactose, although it should be understood that the invention is in no way limited in<br>
this regard and other excipients well-know in the art may be utilized, including<br>
dextrose, fructose, sorbitol, xylitol, sucrose, mannitol, dextrate, cellulose, starch and<br>
combinations of two or more of the foregoing.<br>
The steroid hormone products of the invention are particularly useful as either<br>
oral contraceptives or HRT products. In a preferred embodiment of this aspect of the<br>
invention, the steroid hormone product is an oral contraceptive comprising from<br>
30 about 10 µg to about 50 µg of an estrogen and/or from about 50 µg to about 300 µg<br>
of a progestin. The progestin is preferably either norgestimate, norgestrel,<br>
levonorgestrel, norethindrone or desogestrel, and the estrogen is preferably either<br>
ethinyl estradiol, estradiol, estopipate or mestranol.<br>
In a second aspect, the invention provides a method of preparing such a<br>
steroid hormone product, which method comprises preparing a mixture of at least<br>
one steroid hormone and an excipient, preferably lactose, and imparting to said<br>
mixture mechanical energy sufficient to yield an excipent/steroid powder blend in<br>
which the steroid is stabilized by the excipient in a substantially non-crystalline form.<br>
Preferably, at least about 0.1 hp-min/kg of mechanical energy is imparted to the<br>
mixture. Any method of high energy processing may be employed to impart<br>
sufficient mechanical energy to carry out the process of the invention. One preferred<br>
method of imparting sufficient mechanical energy involves high energy blending of<br>
the lactose and steroid, but other high energy mixing processes known in the art may<br>
be employed such as co-grinding or milling the mixture.<br>
Preferably, the mixture is prepared with a steroid hormone to excipient ratio in<br>
the range of from about 1/1 to about 1/10. However, it should be understood that<br>
the invention is in no way limited in this regard and other hormone/excipient ratios<br>
may be employed depending on the desired concentration of hormone in the final<br>
product. Typically, the ratio of steroid to excipient in the mixture is the same as that<br>
required for the final product. However, it should be understood that an initial<br>
mixture of steroid hormone and excipient may be prepared, with additional excipient<br>
added subsequently to produce a final mixture. The final mixture is then subjected to<br>
high energy processing to impart sufficient mechanical energy to carry out the<br>
invention.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the steroid/excipient mixture is<br>
formed by standard wet processing. For example, a solution of at least one steroid<br>
hormone dissolved in an appropriate solvent is prepared and then sprayed onto the<br>
excipient powder. The solution and excipient are mixed in a suitable processor to<br>
ensure uniform distribution of the solvent in the excipient. The resulting mixture is<br>
then dried by removing the solvent via the application of heat and/or vacuum.<br>
Mechanical energy is then imparted to the mixture as described above to provide the<br>
steroid/excipient powder blend. In another preferred embodiment of the invention,<br>
the steroid and excipient are mixed by standard dry processing and mechanical<br>
energy is then imparted to the mixture as described above to provide the<br>
steroid/excipient powder blend.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
As used herein, the following terms shall have the meaning ascribed to them<br>
below, except when the context clearly indicates differently:<br>
"Poor" or "low" solubility refers to substances that are very slightly soluble to<br>
insoluble according to the following USP definitions.<br>
"Content uniformity" means a relative standard deviation in active ingredient<br>
content of ± 1.5%, preferably ± 1.0% and most preferably ± 0.5%.<br>
As stated abbve, it is known that steroid hormones such as estrogens and<br>
progestins can exist in various solid state forms and that the particular form of the<br>
steroid may significantly effect properties such as dissolution rate and<br>
physical/chemical stability. An increase in dissolution rate and the extent of<br>
dissolution, as well as a decrease in physical/chemical stability are two potential<br>
consequences of modifying the stable crystalline form of these steroid hormones. In<br>
general, the higher energy, non-crystalline solid state form will exhibit an increase in<br>
dissolution rate over the more stable, lower energy crystalline form.<br>
This is also the case with certain excipients such as lactose. Lactose is<br>
commonly selected as an excipient in tablets and capsules. It is commercially<br>
available in an assortment of grades including anhydrous a lactose, a lactose<br>
monohydrate, anhydrous p lactose and spray-dried lactose. Spray-dried lactose<br>
(e.g., FAST-FLO lactose available from Foremost Farms, Baraboo, Wl) is commonly<br>
selected as an excipient in direct compression formulations due to its superior flow<br>
and compression characteristics. This grade of lactose predominately contains pure<br>
a lactose monohydrate in combination with non-crystalline lactose. The non-<br>
crystalline component enhances the compressibility of lactose. Morita et al.,<br>
"Physiochemical Properties of Crystalline Lactose, II. Effect of Crystallinity on<br>
Mechanical and Structural Properties", Chem. Pharm. Bull., Vol. 32, p. 4076 (1984).<br>
The non-crystalline state is metastabie in nature and recrystallization to a more<br>
thermodynamically stable form is inevitable. The tendency for non-crystalline lactose<br>
to rapidly recrystallize upon exposure to relative humidity greater than approximately<br>
60% is well documented. Sebhatu et al., "Assessment of the Degree of Disorder in<br>
Crystaline Solids by Isothermal Microcalorimetry" International Journal of<br>
Pharmaceuticals, Vol. 104, p. 135 (1994). However for many drug substances, this<br>
process can be delayed by the addition of such materials as microcrystalline<br>
cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone or citric acid. Buckton et al., "The Influence of<br>
Additives on the Recrystallization of Amorphous Spray-Dried Lactose", International<br>
Journal of Pharmaceuticals, Vol. 121, p. 81 (1995).<br>
Various unit operations are routinely employed during the manufacture of<br>
conventional steroid hormone products, including milling, blending, wet granulation,<br>
drying and compression. Each process is associated with the incorporation of<br>
mechanical and/or thermal energy into the system. Consequently, the potential for<br>
modification of various solid state properties of steroid active ingredients and<br>
excipients exists. Hüttenraunch, et al., "Mechanical Activation of Pharmaceutical<br>
Systems", Pharmaceutical Research, Vol. 2, p. 302 (1985). As noted above, such<br>
changes may significantly alter properties such as dissolution rate and dissolution<br>
extent, as well as physical/chemical stability (e.g., conversion to a different solid<br>
state form, hydrolysis, etc). Increases in dissolution rate and extent and a decrease<br>
in physical/chemical stability are two potential consequences of modifying the stable<br>
crystalline form of a material. However it would be highly desirable to increase the<br>
dissolution rate while either improving or at least not reducing the physical/chemical<br>
stability. The probability of encountering such crystalline form modifications during<br>
dosage form processing is directly related to the propensity of each ingredient to<br>
exist in a variety of polymorphic forms.<br>
Norgestimate is a potent progestational agent. A thorough investigation of the<br>
polymorphic potential of this substance demonstrated the existence of at least two<br>
solid state forms, a stable crystalline form and a relatively higher energy non-<br>
crystalline form. It is also known that a relatively higher energy non-cystalline form of<br>
lactose exists in addition to the stable crystalline form routinely employed in tablet<br>
manufacture. Similar to lactose, the higher energy non-crystalline form of<br>
norgestimate can be generated via physical or mechanical processes. The present<br>
inventors have found that non-crystalline norgestimate can be physically generated<br>
from solution subsequent to the rapid evaporation of various organic solvents.<br>
Laboratory experiments clearly demonstrate that non-crystalline norgestimate can<br>
also be generated by ball milling. An obvious reduction in norgestimate crystallinity<br>
can be observed within 5 minutes of milling. Considering the relative ease of<br>
crystalline structure modification via mechanical energy, as well as the inherent non-<br>
crystalline lactose content in conventional lactose preparations, it was hypothesized<br>
that co-processing of lactose and norgestimate could result in the generation of a<br>
solid solution. In theory this solid solution would consist of non-crystalline<br>
norgestimate solubilized within the non-crystalline domains of lactose resulting in a<br>
composition exhibiting a more rapid dissolution rate and possibly enhanced<br>
physical/chemical stability.<br>
Research efforts were thus made to generate the non-crystalline form of<br>
norgestimate in the presence and absence of lactose via physical and mechanical<br>
processes. Various mixtures of norgestimate and lactose were prepared. To permit<br>
qualitative or semi-quantitative analysis, the ingredients were thoroughly mixed in<br>
ratios of 1:1 and 1:9 by either dissolving them in a co-solvent mixture or by co-<br>
grinding. Qualitative assessment of the degree of crystallinity was performed<br>
employing Powder X-Ray Diffractometry (PXRD). The minimum detectable level of<br>
crystalline norgestimate in this solid mixture was demonstrated to be approximately<br>
3%.<br>
The physical stability of non-crystalline norgestimate and non-crystalline<br>
lactose were assessed prior to investigation of the drug/excipient interaction. Room<br>
temperature storage conditions employed at various relative humidities (%RH) of<br>
0%, 31% and 76% RH were employed. Complete recrystallization of amorphous<br>
norgestimate was observed within 3 days at all conditions tested. Based on these<br>
data, the ability of lactose to inhibit recrystallization and enhance the physical<br>
stability of non-crystalline norgestimate was investigated.<br>
Co-precipitation of norgestimate and FAST-FLO lactose from a solvent<br>
mixture of ethanol and water was achieved by solvent evaporation under reduced<br>
pressure. In the presence of lactose, norgestimate remained totally amorphous for<br>
at least 32 days at room temperature in a 0% RH chamber. Norgestimate<br>
recrystallized within 3 days in the absence of lactose under the same conditions. As<br>
anticipated, PXRD analysis of both the 1:1 and 1:9 norgestimate:FAST-FLO lactose<br>
mixtures made in this manner demonstrated recrystallization of lactose within 1 hour<br>
at 75% RH. This was anticipated since non-crystalline lactose undergoes rapid<br>
recrystallization at approximately 60% RH. Sebhatu et al., supra. However, the<br>
norgestimate remained partially non-crystalline for at least 6 days at this high relative<br>
humidity. The fact that norgestimate remains in a non-crystalline form subsequent to<br>
the recrystallization of lactose implies that the two compounds are miscible in the<br>
solid state. These findings further support the hypothesis that a metastable solid<br>
solution is formed between lactose and norgestimate when dissolved in a hydro-<br>
alcoholic system and co-precipitated.<br>
In an attempt to more closely mimic the process employed in the manufacture<br>
of steroid hormone tablets by dry processing, 1:9 crystalline norgestimate/FAST-FLO<br>
lactose mixtures were ball milled together for 20 minutes. PXRD analysis indicated<br>
an absence of crystalline norgestimate. However no visually obvious reduction in<br>
the crystallinity of lactose was observed. The milled mixture was stored at room<br>
temperature at 0% RH and at 31 % and 40°C at 75% RH. Based on visual<br>
observation, norgestimate remained in a non-crystalline form at room temperature<br>
for at least 103 days in this mixture. Recrystallization of norgestimate at the<br>
accelerated temperature/humidity condition was initiated between 54 and 82 days.<br>
These data further support the hypothesis that a non-crystalline form of norgestimate<br>
is physically stabilized by lactose even in the absence of detectable modification in<br>
the crystallinity of lactose. One would also anticipate a more rapid dissolution of<br>
norgestimate from a solid solution than from the crystalline form.<br>
Employing the current dissolution standard (USP Apparatus 2,75 rpm, 600ml<br>
of 0.05% Tween 20), the dissolution rates and extent of dissolution for individual<br>
samples of both crystalline and non-crystalline norgestimate were compared. Not<br>
surprisingly, this preliminary investigation demonstrated a difference in dissolution<br>
behavior of the two solid state forms of norgestimate. The results of the study are<br>
set forth below in Table 1.<br>
The dissolution rate and extent of norgestimate dissolution subsequent to co-<br>
milling with lactose at a ratio of 1:9 was also evaluated. PXRD indicated that<br>
norgestimate was rendered non-crystalline while lactose was rendered partially<br>
crystalline following milling. Employing a 100 ml volume of 0.05% Tween 20 as a<br>
medium, dissolution characteristics of norgestimate were determined as a function of<br>
storage time at approximately 40 °C at 75% RH. PXRD was employed to follow the<br>
recrystallization kinetics of the solid solution formed. As anticipated, lactose<br>
recrystallized between 0 and 2 days. Initiation of norgestimate recrystallization was<br>
noted between 17 and 22 days. Norgestimate remained partially crystalline for at<br>
least 44 days under the accelerated storage conditions. The results of the<br>
evaluation are set forth in Table 2.<br>
These data demonstrate that the dissolution properties of norgestimate in<br>
combination with lactose (1:9 ratio) change as norgestimate begins to recrystallize<br>
from the metastable solid solution. These data further demonstrate the potential<br>
influence of mechanical energy on the solid state form of norgestimate and lactose i<br>
norgestimate tablets.<br>
Differences in the dissolution behavior of norgestimate from tablets<br>
manufactured by dry processing on both a pilot scale and a production scale were<br>
also evaluated. The minimum mechanical energy of 0.1 hp-min/kg can be imparted<br>
in a dry process using a geometric tumbler blender equipped for additional mixing<br>
energy with blades or choppers. A progestin such as norgestimate can be combined<br>
with lactose and additives. Increasing the length of processing time with the blades<br>
or choppers in use would impart sufficient energy to produce the forms identified in<br>
this invention. The results of a dissolution rate study at two different equipment<br>
scales is presented in Tables 3a and 3b. With an increase in dissolution rate being<br>
an indirect measure of the presence of the invention, the data indicate higher levels<br>
of the less crystalline progestin as greater energy is imparted over time. The<br>
importance of dissolution rate as a function of mixing time is also noted. The results<br>
of the evaluation are reported in Tables 3a and 3b, respectively.<br>
As the data set forth below in Table 4 demonstrate, the relative stability of<br>
dissolution properties of tablets manufactured by wet processing and stored<br>
unprotected under accelerated conditions are also sensitive to changes in mixing<br>
energetics. The data in Table 4 further support the existence of a high energy form<br>
of norgestimate in the presence of lactose. In addition, changes in dissolution<br>
behavior when stored at 40 °C at 75% RH is demonstrated in Table 4. Like the data<br>
reported in Table 2, dissolution properties are dependent on storage conditions.<br>
However it is apparent that the extent of such changes is further dependent on the<br>
mixing energetics imparted during the process.<br>
Based on the studies reported above, it has been determined that when a<br>
mixture of an excipient and a steroid active ingredient is subjected to sufficient<br>
mechanical energy, the excipient and the steroid active ingredient form a less<br>
crystalline, more highly energetic composition. Furthermore, under appropriate<br>
mixing conditions, the lactose component stabilizes the steroid in a highly energetic,<br>
substantially non-crystalline state, thus preventing recrystallization of the steroid.<br>
This is particularly important in the case of a progestin such as norgestimate that is<br>
quite unstable in the non-crystalline form and prone to rapid recrystallization. The<br>
highly energetic, non-crystalline steroid active ingredient dissolves more readily and<br>
is better able to maintain desirable dissolution characteristics under a variety of<br>
conditions of ambient humidity and ambient temperature. In addition it has been<br>
demonstrated that the high-energy steroid : lactose mixture has a higher<br>
recrystallization temperature than the same steroid lactose mixture has under<br>
conditions where it has not been subjected to high energy mixing and where the<br>
mixture components remain in the amorphous state. (Table 7, Example 3)<br>
As noted previously, preferably at least about 0.1 (hp-min)/kg of mechanical<br>
energy is imparted to the mixture, most preferably at least about 0.12 (hp-min)/kg of<br>
mechanical energy. Any method of high energy processing may be employed to<br>
impart sufficient mechanical energy to carry out the process of the invention. One<br>
preferred method involves high energy blending carried out in equipment which is<br>
able to impart the energy level needed to achieve the invention. Examples of such<br>
equipment include a geometric tumble blender with an intensification system, a bowl<br>
type blender with a high shear blade or impeller or a ribbon blender with appropriate<br>
energy capacity. The blending system would be operated with parameters<br>
appropriate to deliver the energy necessary to achieve the invention. Alternatively,<br>
grinding or milling, may be employed. This is accomplished in a commonly available<br>
mill grinder. Milling conditions can vary within a substantial range, typically the<br>
mixture is milled for a period of 10-30 minutes, preferably about 20 minutes when a<br>
small mill with a ball is employed.<br>
Although not critical, it is preferable to control humidity before and during the<br>
mixing operation to 55% relative humidity or lower to further inhibit crystallization of<br>
the components, and mixing is also preferably conducted at an ambient temperature.<br>
As also noted previously, additional ingredients may be added to the mixture,<br>
preferably such ingredients are added to the excipient powder prior to the high<br>
energy mixing operation. Typically employed ingredients include: (i) disintegrants<br>
such as clays, alginic acid and alginates, celluloses such as microcrystailine<br>
cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, cross-linked polymers such as cross-linked<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone (crospovidone) or cross-linked sodium carboxymethylcellulose,<br>
and polacrilin potassium, starches such as sodium starch glycolate, starch and<br>
pregelatinized starch; (ii) lubricants such as talc, magnesium stearate, calcium<br>
stearate, stearic acid, colloidal silicon dioxide, magnesium carbonate, magnesium<br>
oxide, calcium silicate; and (iii) colorants such as caramel, D&amp;C and FD&amp;C dyes, for<br>
example. Other additional ingredients include glidants, filters, binders and the like.<br>
The foregoing additional ingredients, as well as any other excipients or processing<br>
aids, can be added as required to yield a material suitable to be processed into a<br>
steroid hormone product.<br>
The process of this invention is most suitable for the preparation of oral<br>
contraceptives containing one or more steroids, preferably a progestin, most<br>
preferably norgestimate, and/or an estrogen preferably ethinyl estradiol as the active<br>
ingredient(s). Instead of norgestimate, oral contraceptives containing norgestrel,<br>
levonorgestrel, desogestrel, 3-ketodesorgestrel, or norethindrone as the progestin<br>
can be prepared by the present invention. The oral contraceptives may also contain<br>
an estrogen compound such as ß-estradiol, ethinyl estradiol, 17-a ethinyl estradiol,<br>
3-methyl ether estropipate and mestranol. However, the process has applicability to<br>
the preparation of any pharmaceutical preparation which contains as the active<br>
ingredient, a material having low to moderate solubility in water and which exists in a<br>
variety of polymorphs some of which may be stabilized via a physical interaction with<br>
an excipient such as lactose to yield a more rapidly soluble material. Furthermore,<br>
the process is particularly applicable to the preparation of oral contraceptives<br>
containing within a kit solid oral dosage forms of varying potency as to a particular<br>
active ingredient, as described above. Alternatively, the process of the invention can<br>
be used to prepare HRT products which also contain an estrogen and/or a progestin<br>
generally in different active ingredient amount combinations than the oral<br>
contraceptives.<br>
The following examples describe the invention in greater detail and are<br>
intended to illustrate it without limiting its scope.<br>
Example 1<br>
Amorphous Lactose/Noraestimate Dry Ground Mixture<br>
Amorphous norgestimate was prepared by dissolving norgestimate (200. mg)<br>
in 5 ml of (DCM) dichloromethane and 0.26ml ethanol (EtOH). The solution was<br>
filtered through a 0.2µm filter, and solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure<br>
to afford amorphous solid.<br>
Mixtures of norgestimate and lactose, in amorphous and crystalline forms,<br>
were milled for 20 minutes. The amorphous state of each ingredient and of the<br>
mixture was confirmed by powder x-ray pattern diffraction (PXRD ). The results are<br>
described below and summarized in Table 5.<br>
A mixture of crystalline norgestimate:cystalline lactose (1:9) was milled in a<br>
Wig-I-Bug mill. A small mill containing a ball afforded amorphous norgestimate with<br>
mostly crystalline lactose, whereas a larger mill containing a bar yielded both as<br>
crystalline materials. Milling a 1:1 mixture of crystalline norgestimate:crystalline<br>
lactose afforded partially crystalline norgestimate with mostly crystalline lactose.<br>
A mixture of amorphous norgestimate and amorphous lactose (1:9) was<br>
milled also. The resulting solid mixture showed an amorphous PXRD pattern for<br>
both components. Milling 1:1 mixtures of amorphous norgestimate and amorphous<br>
lactose also afforded non-crystalline mixtures.<br>
Table 5: Preparation of Amorphous Norgestimate:Lactose by Milling<br>
Example 2<br>
Stability Studies of Amorphous Materials<br>
This study shows that amorphous norgestimate is stabilized by lactose in a<br>
number of norgestimate : lactose preparations. Stress studies as well as thermal<br>
analyses (Example 3) showed the stabilization of norgestimate in norgestimate :<br>
latose mixtures.<br>
Amorphous norgestimate was prepared from DCM:EtOH solution, and its<br>
stability was studied under various humidity conditions to establish a baseline of<br>
norgestimate stability. In order to simulate drug products, non-crystalline<br>
norgestimate : lactose mixtures were obtained from one of the following four<br>
methods: co-precipitation from EtOH:H2O, or 2-BuOH:H20, spray drying onto<br>
amorphous lactose, milling of crystalline mixtures, or milling of amorphous mixtures.<br>
The physical stability of non-crystalline norgestimate to resist recrystallization was<br>
also studied in the absence of and with an equal amount of lactose.<br>
The materials for each sample were prepared as follows:<br>
Amorphous Norgestimate<br>
Norgestimate (200 mg) was dissolved in 5 mL of DCM and 0.26 mL of<br>
ethanol. The solution was filtered through a 0.2 µm filter and solvent was evaporated<br>
under reduced pressure to afford the amorphous solid.<br>
Amorphous Lactose<br>
FAST-FLO lactose (516 mg) was dissolved in 17 mL of H2O and filtered<br>
through a 0.2µm filter, then lyophilized to afford dry material. However, the solid was<br>
partially crystalline.<br>
Co-precipitation of Norgestimate/Lactose<br>
Norgestimate (10 mg) and FAST-FLO lactose (91 mg) were dissolved in 143<br>
mL of EtOH:H20 (3.56:1) and filtered through a 0.45 µm filter. The solvent was<br>
evaporated under reduced pressure to afford amorphous solid.<br>
Norgestimate (20 mg) and FAST-FLO lactose (180 mg) were dissolved in 65<br>
mL of 2-Butanol: Water (68:32) and filtered through a 0.2µm filter. The solvent was<br>
evaporated under reduced pressure at 30°C to afford a non-crystalline solid.<br>
Norgestimate (10 mg) and FAST-FLO lactose (90 mg) were dissolved in 29<br>
mL of ACN: H2O (2.6:1) at 60°C and filtered through a 0.2µm filter. The solvent was<br>
evaporated under reduced pressure at 35°C to afford a non-crystalline solid.<br>
Spray Drying of Norgestimate/Lactose<br>
Amorphous lactose was placed in a round bottom flask and attached to a<br>
vacuum pump. A solution of norgestimate in 95:5 EtOH:H2O (0.5 mg/mL) was filtered<br>
through a 0.2µm filter and sprayed into the round-bottom flask containing lactose<br>
while the vacuum was applied. The solution of norgestimate dried on the surface of<br>
the lactose solid to afford non-crystalline norgestimate.<br>
A solution of amorphous lactose in methanol was applied on silica gel TLC<br>
and observed under a short-wave UV lamp. An UV active spot was observed.<br>
Lactose alone showed no UV active spots.<br>
Milling of Norgestimate/Lactose<br>
Norgestimate (50 mg) and FAST-FLO lactose (450 mg) were placed in a Wig-<br>
L-Bug mill, and milled with" a bar for 20 minutes to afford non-crystalline<br>
norgestimate.<br>
Physical Mixing of Norgestimate/Lactose<br>
Norgestimate (2.2 mg) and lactose (2.6 mg) were mixed with a spatula in a<br>
vial for 1 minute. Additional amounts of lactose (4.6 mg) were added and then mixed<br>
with a spatula for another minute. This was repeated until all of the lactose was<br>
added (9.0 mg, 2.6 mg, total of 18.8 mg).<br>
Stability Studies of Amorphous Material<br>
A vial containing a small amount of amorphous material was placed in a<br>
humidity chamber containing an aqueous salt solution and the chamber was sealed.<br>
The sample was analyzed at specified time points by PXRD .<br>
PXRD<br>
PXRD analyses were carried out on a Shimadzu XRD-6000 X-ray powder<br>
diffractormeter using Cu Ka radiation (1.5406.A). The instrument is equipped with a<br>
fine-focus X-ray tube. The tube voltage and amperage was set at 40 kV and 40 mA,<br>
respectively. The divergence and scattering slits were set at 1 ° and the receiving<br>
slit was set at 0.15 mm. Diffracted radiation was detected by a Nal scintillation<br>
detector. A theta-two theta continuous scan at 3 /min (0.4 sec/0.02 step) from 2.5 to<br>
40° 20 was used. A silicon standard was analyzed each day to check the<br>
instrument alignment. Each sample was analyzed on a quartz sample holder.<br>
Table 6 summarizes the results of the stability studies. The data demonstrate<br>
that the simulated drug products of this invention show superior physical stability<br>
compared to amorphous norgestimate alone. In the absence of lactose, amorphous<br>
norgestimate recrystallizes in less 3 days at 0% relative humidity and less than 1 day<br>
at 31% and 76% relative humidities. Co-precipitates from EtOH:H2O or 2-BuOH:H2O<br>
show stability (ie. onset of norgestimate recrystallization) to 90 days or 25 days,<br>
respectively, at 0% RH. In spray-dried or milled mixtures, norgestimate remained<br>
essentially non-crystalline during the entire study period (97 days) at 0% or 31% RH.<br>
A milled mixture showed the best stability at 76% RH, stabilizing non-crystalline<br>
norgestimate up to about 82 days. A 1:1 milled amorphous mixture showed partially<br>
crystalline norgestimate and after 93 days it remained partially crystalline. From<br>
these studies, it can be concluded that lactose stabilized norgestimate in an<br>
essentially non-crystalline form.<br>
Table 6: Stability of Amorphous Norgestimate<br>
Example 3<br>
The lactose/norgestimate mixtures made as in Example 2 were subjected to<br>
thermal analysis, according to conventional Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC).<br>
Glass-Transition Temperature and Crystallization Exotherm Measurements<br>
Amorphous materials exhibit glass-transition temperatures (Tg) that reflect the<br>
physical stability of the amorphous form. The stabilized mixtures,<br>
norgestimate:lactose (1:9) mixtures, were examined along with individual amorphous<br>
materials to obtain Tg values that might give insight to the stability of each mixture<br>
compared to a single-component system. Glass-transition temperature<br>
measurements generally entail trial runs on a DSC to obtain an optimal method for<br>
observing glass-transition events. Amorphous lactose exhibits a very strong Tg<br>
event at 114-115 °C. However, amorphous norgestimate does not produce<br>
consistent Tg events. Some amorphous norgestimate samples produce a weak Tg<br>
event at 122-123 °C, while other samples shown an exothermic event, probably<br>
because of norgestimate crystallization. All of the norgestimate samples show a<br>
similar endothermic event at 226-228 °C. The thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) of<br>
samples show rapid weight loss at that temperature, therefore, the endotherm over<br>
220°C primarily corresponds to decomposition. The Merck Index lists the melting<br>
temperature of the crystalline norgestimate at 214-218°C.<br>
Another DSC method used revealed a consistent thermal event<br>
corresponding to the crystallization of norgestimate (Tc). This thermal event (Tc)<br>
was used to measure the stability of different simulated drug products. The<br>
temperature of Tc- should be higher if norgestimate is stabilized by lactose.<br>
The simulated drug products show the absence or a higher crystallization<br>
event (Tc) compared to pure amorphous norgestimate (Table 7). The Tc data are<br>
consistent with the physical stability data, proving that amorphous norgestimate<br>
stabilization is achieved by lactose.<br>
Table 7: Tc Measurements of Amorphous Mixtures<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Wet/Dry Processing<br>
A progestin such as norgestimate is dissolved in an appropriate solvent such<br>
as methanol or ethanol. The solution is then deposited onto a powder bed<br>
containing lactose and several other additives. The deposition involves creating<br>
droplets of the solution which are sprayed onto the powder bed with mixing to<br>
prevent lumps. After sufficient time for all the solution to be deposited the solvent is<br>
removed using vacuum and heat. When a predetermined minimum quantity of<br>
solvent has been removed, the mixture is then subjected to further blending. The<br>
blending is performed, for example, in a geometric tumble blender equipped with an<br>
impeller or chopper blades for a length of time sufficient to impart mechanical energy<br>
as described above to produce a lactose/progestin powder blend with the progestin<br>
stabilized in substantially non-crystalline form.<br>
