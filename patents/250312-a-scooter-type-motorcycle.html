SCOOTER-TYPE MOTORCYCLE<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a scooter-type motorcycle in which a power unit composed of an engine with a cylinder axis line of an engine main body tilted forward, and a transmission for transmitting an output of the engine to a rear wheel is swingably supported by a body frame, the rear wheel is journalled to a rear part of a transmission case continuing to the engine main body and extending backward to a side of the rear wheel for housing the transmission, and a downstream end of intake passage forming means with an upstream end. connected to an air cleaner disposed on an upper part of the transmission case is connected to an upper side face of a cylinder head composing a part of the engine main body.<br>
[0002]<br>
An example of this scooter-type motorcycle is disclosed in Patent Document JP 2002-235535 A. In the scooter-type motorcycle, a secondary air control valve for controlling the quantity of secondary air supplied from a sub-air cleaner different from an air cleaner of an intake system to an exhaust system of an engine is disposed on a side of the intake system so as to be positioned on an upper part of the intake system in side view.<br><br>
[0003]<br>
However, when the secondary air control valve is relatively separated from the engine, the length of a secondary air supply passage from the secondary air control valve to the exhaust system of the engine is increased, and piping arrangement structure becomes complicated. Also, since a power unit is swingablly supported by a body frame, when the secondary air control valve is supported on a body frame side, it is necessary to sufficiently ensure a clearance, for allowing the swing motion, of piping for interconnecting the secondary air control valve and the power unit. For this reason, the secondary air control valve is preferably disposed as close to the engine as possible. [0004]<br>
Moreover, in a transmission system of the power unit mounted in the motorcycle, an endless belt or a chain is wound between a driving shaft rotated by the power of the internal combustion engine and a driven shaft interlocked with a rear wheel, the power of the internal combustion engine is transmitted to the rear wheel, and the motorcycle is driven.<br>
The transmission system is housed in the transmission case.<br>
[0005]<br>
The transmission case of this type of power unit is extended backward with the transmission case normally biased on the left side of the internal combustion engine and the transmission case long longitudinally is divided sideways.<br><br>
In a patent document JP 2005-273763 A, a transmission case having such structure is disclosed, the disclosed transmission case is provided with mutually opposite joined faces at peripheral edges of right and left transmission cases divided sideways, the joined faces are touched, are fastened by bolts, and the transmission case houses a transmission system inside. [0006]'<br>
In the transmission case disclosed in the patent document JP 2005-2737 63 A, the left transmission case located on the outside of the body journals a left end of a driven shaft via a bearing.<br>
Therefore, a bearing concave portion is formed in the left transmission case to fit an outer ring of the bearing. [0007]<br>
In the left transmission case, the bearing concave portion is fitted to the outer ring of the bearing an inner ring of which is fitted onto the left end of the driven shaft, the joined face of the peripheral edge is joined to the joined face of the peripheral edge of the right transmission case so that the transmission system arranged inside the left side of the right transmission case is covered, the left transmission case is fastened to the right transmission case by the bolt, and is attached to the right case. [0008]<br>
As the left transmission case is attached to the right transmission case as described above, the left transmission case may be unable to be easily detached because the bearing<br><br>
concave portion of the left transmission case is fitted to the outer ring of the bearing fitted onto the left end of the driven shaft even if the bolt is unfastened when the left transmission case is detached because of maintenance and others. [0009]<br>
That is, the left transmission case is moved leftward from the right transmission case and the bearing concave portion fitted to the outer ring of the bearing is required to be extracted, however, the outside face of the left transmission case is parallel in an extracted direction, force in the extracted direction cannot effectively affect, and work for detachment may be troublesome-<br>
[0010]<br>
Accordingly, the present invention has been made in view of the foregoing, and an object of the present invention is to provide a scooter-type motorcycle wherein a secondary air control valve is disposed sufficiently close to an engine main body in order to address the above-mentioned problem. [0011]<br>
Additionally, according to the subject-matter of dependent claims 4 to 6 a further object is to provide a transmission case excellent in workability where one of transmission -cases divided sideways can be easily detached and work for detachment does not require much labor and much time of a power unit.<br>
[0012] <br>
In order to accomplish the above-mentioned object, the<br><br>
invention described in Claim 1 is characterized in that, in a scooter-type motorcycle in which: a power unit composed of an engine with a cylinder axis line of an engine main body tilted forwards and a transmission for transmitting an output of the engine to a rear wheel is swingablly supported by a body frame; the rear wheel is journalled to a rear part of a transmission case continuing to the engine main body and extending backward to a side of the rear wheel for housing the transmission; and a downstream end of intake passage forming means with an upstream end connected to an air cleaner disposed on an upper part of the transmission case is connected to an upper side face of a cylinder head composing a part of the engine main body, a secondary air control valve for controlling the quantity of secondary air supplied from the air cleaner to an exhaust system of the engine, is disposed on a side of the intake passage forming means, in front of the air cleaner and above the engine main body, with at least one part overlapped with the intake passage forming means in side view.<br>
[0013]<br>
Furthermore, the invention described in Claim 2 is characterized in that, in addition to the constitution of the invention described in Claim 1, the secondary air control valve and an ignition coil are supported in common by a stay elastically supported by the engine main body or the body frame.<br>
[0014]<br>
Moreover, the invention described in Claim 3 is<br><br>
characterized in that, in addition to the constitution of the invention described in Claim 2, the secondary air control valve is elastically supported by the stay. [0015]<br>
Additionally, the invention described in Claim 4 is characterized by, in addition to the constitution of the invention described in any of the preceding claims, a transmission case structure of the power unit in which right and left transmission cases divided sideways house a transmission system including a power transmission mechanism between a driving shaft rotated by the power of the internal combustion engine of the power unit mounted in the vehicle and a driven shaft interlocked with the rear wheel, the transmission case arranged on the outside of the body out of the right and left transmission cases rotatably journals an end of the driven shaft via a bearing with the end of the driven shaft fitted to a bearing concave portion, and provides transmission case structure of the power unit where mutually opposite protruded pieces are formed in substantially vertically symmetrical positions with the driven shaft at right and left peripheral edges forming mutually opposite joined faces of the right and left transmission cases in the right and left transmission cases. [0016]<br>
Furthermorer the invention described in Claim 5 is characterized by, in addition to the constitution of the invention described in Claim 4, a characteristic that a gap is made between the mutually opposite protruded pieces.<br><br>
[0017]<br>
Moreover, the invention described in Claim 6 is characterized by, in addition to the constitution of the invention described m Claims 4 or 5, a characteristic that the transmission system is a belt continuously variable transmission in which an endless belt that is the power transmission mechanism is wound between the driving shaft and the driven shaft, the right and left transmission cases are extended backward from the driving shaft on the front side and journal the driven shaft on the rear side. [0018]<br>
According to the invention described in Claim 1, the secondary air control valve is disposed on the side of the intake passage forming means, in front of the air cleaner and above the engine main body, with at least one part overlapped with the intake passage forming means in side view. Therefore, the secondary air control valve can be effectively disposed in the space of the side of the intake passage forming means .as close to the engine main body as possible, thereby reducing the length of a secondary air supply passage from the secondary air control valve to the exhaust system of the engine, simplifying piping arrangement structure, and reducing a clearance, for allowing the swing motion of the power unit, of piping for interconnecting the secondary air control valve and the power unit even when the secondary air control valve is supported on a body frame side. Also, since the engine main body is provided below the secondary air control valve, the secondary air control valve can be.<br><br>
effectively protected against splashes of mud or water during traveling of the scooter-type motorcycle.<br>
[0019]<br>
Furthermore, according to the invention described in<br>
Claim 2,   the ignition coil and the secondary air control valve are supported in common by the stay. Thus, the number of parts required for supporting the ignition coil and the secondary air control valve may be reduced, and the stay may be mounted on the engine main body or the body frame, with the ignition coil and the secondary air control valve supported by the stay, thereby simplifying assembling work. Also, since the stay is elastically supported by the engine main body or the body frame, natural frequencies may be reduced, and vibration-proofing performance may be enhanced, by relatively increasing the weight of the stay mounted with the ignition coil and the secondary air control valve, [0020]<br>
Moreover, according to the invention described in Claim 3, the secondary air control valve is elastically supported by the engine main body or the body frame with double vibration-proofing structure, thereby more effectively suppressing the vibration transmitted to the secondary air control valve, [0021]<br>
Additionally, according to the invention described in Claim 4, as the mutually opposite protruded pieces are formed in the substantially vertically symmetrical positions with the driven shaft at the right and left peripheral edges<br><br>
forming the mutually opposite joined faces of the right and left transmission cases in each of the right and left transmission cases, force effectively acts in the direction where the bearing concave portion fitted to the outer ring of the bearing the inner ring of which is fitted onto the driven shaft is extracted by inserting a tool between the mutually opposite protruded pieces and extending a gap between both protruded pieces, the bearing concave portion can be easily extracted, one transmission case can be easily detached without damaging the outside faces of the transmission cases, and the transmission case structure is excellent in the workability of detachments [0022]<br>
Furthermore, according to the invention described in Claim 5, as the gap is made between the mutually opposite protruded pieces, a tool can be easily inserted between the mutually opposite protruded pieces and the workability of detachment is more enhanced. [0023]<br>
Moreover, according to the invention described in Claim 6, as the transmission system is the belt continuously variable transmission in which an endless belt that is the power transmission mechanism is wound between the driving shaft and the driven shaft, the right and left transmission cases are extended backward from the driving shaft on the front side and journal the driven shaft on the rear side, the right and left transmission cases of the belt continuously variable transmission are made long longitudinally, the<br><br>
rigidity of the transmission case itself is decreased, force when one transinission case is detached is hardly transmitted to the bearing concave portion fitted to the outer ring of the bearing, however, as force acts so that the gap between both protruded pieces is extended by inserting a tool between the mutually opposite protruded pieces located close to the bearing and in the substantially vertically symmetrical positions with the driven shaft, force effectively acts in the direction in which the bearing concave portion fitted to the outer ring of the bearing is extracted, one transinission case can be easily detached without deforming the transmission case, and the workability of detachment can be maintained to be high, [0024]<br>

[0048]<br>
As shown in Figs- 3 and 4, the ignition coil 36 supported by the stay 37, and the vicinity of a connecting part of the upstream rubber hose 70 to the air cleaner 27 are<br><br>
covered with a cover 72. A rear part of the cover 72 is fastened to the air cleaner 27 with a bolt 73 (see Fig. 3), The cover 72 is supported on the intermediate support part 39f of the stay 37 through a mount rubber 74.<br>

[0051]<br>
Then,   the advantages  of this  embodiment will be described.    The  secondary air control valve 35  for controlling<br><br>
the quantity of the secondary air supplied from the air cleaner 27 to the exhaust system 31 of the engine E, is disposed on the side of the intake passage forming means 26 with the upstream end connected to the air cleaner 27 and the downstream end connected to the engine main body 19, in front of the air cleaner 27 and above the engine main body 19, with at least one part overlapped with the intake passage forming means 2 6 in side view. Therefore, the secondary air control valve 35 can be effectively disposed in the space of the side of the intake passage forming means 26 as close to the engine main body 19 as possible, thereby reducing the length of a secondary air supply passage from the secondary air control valve 35 to the exhaust system 31 of the engine E, and simplifying piping arrangement structure. Also, since the engine main body 19 is provided below the secondary air control valve 35, the secondary air control valve 35 can be effectively protected against splashes of mud or water during traveling of the scooter-type motorcycle, [0052]<br>
Furthermore, the secondary air control valve 35 and the ignition coil 36 are supported in common by the stay 37 supported by the engine main body 19, Thus, the number of parts required for supporting the ignition coil 36 and the secondary air control valve 35 can be reduced, and the stay 37 can be mounted on the engine main body 19, with the ignition coil 3 6 and the secondary air control valve 35 supported by the stay 37, thereby simplifying assembling work. Also, since the stay 37 is elastically supported by the<br><br>
engine main body 19, the stay 37 mounted with the ignition coil 36 and the secondary air control valve 35 is relatively increased in weight, thereby reducing natural frequencies and enhancing vibration-proofing performance.<br>
[0053]<br>
Moreover, the secondary air control valve 35 is elastically supported by the stay 37, and therefore is elastically supported by the engine main body 19 with double vibration-proofing structure, thereby more effectively suppressing the vibration transmitted to the secondary air control valve 35,<br>
[0054]<br>
As another embodiment of the present invention, the stay 37 may be elastically supported by the body frame F. In that case, the secondary air control valve 35 is disposed on the side of the intake passage forming means 26, in front of the air cleaner 27 and above the engine main body 19/ with at least one part overlapped with the intake passage forming means 2 6 in side view, thereby reducing a clearance, for allowing the swing motion of the power unit P, of piping for interconnecting the secondary air control valve 35 and the power unit P-<br>

[0064]<br>
In the meantime, in the rear of the power transmission chamber C, a driven shaft 250 opposite to the driving shaft (the crankshaft 215) is rotatably journalled by the left unit<br><br>
case 211L; the transmission case  cover 270 and a gear case cover 251 via each bearing 234, 235, 236.<br>

[0066]<br>
The V-belt 232 wound between the opposite conical surfaces of the fixed pulley half 230a on the driving side and the moving pulley half 230b on the driving side of the driving pulley 230 in the front is wound between opposite conical surfaces of the fixed pulley half 240a on the driven side and the moving pulley half 240b on the driven side of the driven pulley 240 in the rear. [0067]<br>
As the belt continuously variable transmission T is configured as described above, the moving pulley half 230b on<br><br>
the driving side is off the fixed pulley half 230a on the driving side in the driving pulley 230 when the engine speed of the internal combustion engine E is small, a wound radius of the V-belt 232 is small, and in the driven pulley 240, as the moving pulley half 240b on the driven side pressed by the helical compression spring 240c is close to the fixed pulley half 240a on the driven side and a wound radius of the V-belt 232 is large, the power of the crankshaft 215 is transmitted to an output shaft at large gear ratio. [0068]<br>
As plural weight rollers 230d are moved outside in a radial direction by centrifugal force in the driving pulley 230 and press the moving pulley half 230b on the driving side so that it is close to the fixed pulley half 230a on the driving side when the engine speed increases, the wound radius of the v-belt 232 increases, and in the driven pulley 240, as the moving pulley half 240b on the driven side is off the fixed pulley half 240a on the driven side against the resilient force of the helical compression spring 240c and the wound radius of the V-belt 232 decreases, gear ratio decreases. [0069]<br>
A clutch outer 248 of a centrifugal clutch L is fitted onto the driven shaft 250 extended on the left side of a left end of the rotary sleeve 237 and a drive plate 245 is fitted to the left end of the rotary sleeve 237 inside the bowl-like clutch outer- 248, [0070]<br><br>
When the rotary sleeve 237 is revolved at larger revolution speed than predetermined revolution speed, plural clutch shoes 246 rockably supported by the drive plate 245 are rocked outside in a radial direction against the resilient force of a clutch spring 247 by centrifugal force, a friction member 246a provided to an outside face of each clutch shoe 24 6 is touched to an inside face of the clutch outer 248, the centrifugal clutch L is turned connected, and the revolution of the driven pulley 240 is transmitted to the driven shaft 250. [0071]<br>
The gear case cover 251 covers the right side of the rear of the left unit case 211L, a speed reducing gear chamber 252 is formed, and the speed reducing gear train R is housed in the speed reducing gear chamber 252.<br>
In the speed reducing gear chamber 252, a speed reducing gear shaft 253 is rotatably journalled via bearings 254, 254 in parallel with the driven shaft 250, further, a rear axle 255 is rotatably journalled via bearings 256, 256, a right half of the rear axle 255 is protruded outside through the gear case cover 251, and a rear wheel is supported by the right half.

v;ith the speed reducing gear shaft 253 is engaged with a large-diameter gear 255a fitted onto the rear axle 255-<br>
Therefore^ the revolution speed of the driven shaft 250 is reduced via the speed reducing gear train R, the revolution is transmitted to the rear axle 255, and the rear wheel is rotated. [0073]<br>
As described above, the power of the crankshaft 215 of the belt continuously variable transmission T of the internal combustion engine E is input to the driving pulley 230 of the belt continuously variable transmission T, is automatically shifted at gear ratio according to the engine speed of the internal combustion engine E in the belt continuously variable transmission T, is transmitted to the driven pulley 240/ and further, is transmitted to the driven shaft 250 via the centrifugal clutch L*<br>
The revolution of the driven shaft 250 is transmitted ro the rear axle 255 after the revolution speed is reduced by the speed reducing gear train R. [0074]<br>

The upper protruded piece 277 is integrated with the fastening boss 273. [0079]<br>
As shown in Fig, 9, in the left unit case 211L to which the transmission case cover 270 is fitted, a cut-out opening 262 is formed corresponding to the cut-out opening 272 in a state in which the joined face 261a of the peripheral edge 261 is opposite to the joined face 271a, [0080]<br>
A fastening boss 263 threaded inside is formed corresponding to each of the plural fastening bosses 273 of the transmission case cover 270 at the peripheral edge"261 of the left unit case 211L,<br>
The fastening boss 2 63 has the same plane as the joined face 261a,<br>
A fastening boss 264 is protruded from the substantial center of the left unit case 211L to the joined face 261a in the power transmission chamber C corresponding to the fastening boss 274 of the transmission case cover 270. [0081]<br>
Rectangular protruded pieces 2 67, 2 68 are formed at the peripheral edge 261 of the left unit case 211L opposite to the protruded pieces 277, 278 of the transmission case cover 270. -<br>
The protruded pieces 267, 268 are located in substantially vertically symmetrical positions with the driven shaft 250 and are formed in the positions slightly off<br><br>
the joined face 261a rightward. [0082]<br>
When the transmission case cover 270 is attached to the left unit case 211L described above, the joined face 271a on which the sealing member 280 is fitted into the groove 271b of the peripheral edge 271 of the transmission case cover 270 is touched to the joined face 261a of the peripheral edge 261 of the left unit case 211L, fitting the bearing concave portion 276 of the transmission case cover 270 to the outer ring of the bearing 235 the inner ring of which is fitted onto a left end of the driven shaft 250, a bolt 281 is inserted into each hole of the fastening bosses 263, 264 of the transmission case cover 270, is screwed to each female screw of the fastening bosses 273, 274 of the left unit case 211L, and is tightened. [0083]<br>
When the transmission case cover 270 is attached to the left unit case 211L as described above, each protruded piece 267, 268 of the left unit case 211L is opposite to each protruded piece 277, 278 on the side of the transmission case cover 270 via a gap as shown in Figs. 13 and 14. [0084]<br>
A front L cover 282 is attached to the left side of the front of the transmission case cover 270 attached to the left unit case 211L and covers the circular opening 275 of the transmission case cover 270,<br>
A fan 283 is formed on the left side of the fixed pulley half 230a on the driving side fitted onto the<br><br>
crankshaft 215, when the fixed pulley half 230a on the driving side is rotated together with the crankshaft 215, air is taken into the power transmission chamber C from the circular opening 275 by the rotation of the fan 283, the belt continuously variable transmission T is cooled, and the air is exhausted from the cut-out openings 262, 272 at the back, [0085]<br>
When the transmission case cover 270 is detached from the left unit case 211L because of maintenance and others, the bolt 281 is first removed and the transmission case cover 270 has only to be pulled on the left side of the left unit case 211L, however, as the bearing concave portion 276 of the transmission case cover 270 is fitted to the outer ring of the bearing 235 provided to the left end of the driven shaft 250, it is not easy to detach the transmission case cover. [0086]<br>
Then, in transmission case structure equivalent to this embodiment, the upside of the transmission case cover 270 can be easily moved leftward utilizing a principle of a lever by inserting an end of a tool an end of which is flat and sharp such as a minus screwdriver into the gap between the protruded piece 277 on the side of the transmission case cover 270 and the protruded piece 2 67 of the left unit case 211L respectively opposite on the upside of the driven shaft 250 and pushing the tool down with the base so that the gap is extended, and similarly, the downside of the transmission case cover 270 can be easily moved leftward by inserting the tool into the gap between the protruded piece 278 on the side<br><br>
of the transmission case cover 270 and the protruded piece 268 of the left unit case 211L respectively opposite on the downside of the driven shaft 250 and operating it so that the gap is extended, [0087]<br>
