Dispersing agents in nanocomposites<br>
The present invention relates to a composition, preferably a nanocomposite material, comprising (a) a synthetic polymer, especially a polyolefin, (b) a filler, especially a natural or synthetic phyllosilicate or a mixture of such phyliosilicates, preferably in nanoparticles, and (c) a dispersing agent prepared by controlled free radical polymerization (CFRP). The present invention relates also to a process for the preparation of a synthetic polymer nanocomposite material which comprises melt mixing a mixture of a) a synthetic polymer, b) a filler, and c) a dispersing agent prepared by controlled free radical polymerization and to the use of the latter to intercalate and exfoliate a filler and disperse the filler in a synthetic polymer matrix to form a nanocomposite material.<br>
The addition of fillers to organic materials, especially polymers, is known and is described for example in Hans Zweifel (editor), Plastics Additives Handbook, 5th Edition, pages 901-948, Hanser Publishers, Munich 2001. The use of fillers in polymers has the advantage that it is possible to bring about improvement in, for example, the mechanical properties, especially the density, hardness, rigidity (modulus) or reduced shrinkage of the polymer.<br>
Using extremely small filler particles (with one dimension 
Nano-scale fillers possess an extremely large surface area with high surface energy. The deactivation of the surface energy and the compatibilization of the nano-scale fillers with a polymeric substrate is, therefore, even more important than with a common micro-scale filler in order to avoid aggregation during processing or conversion of the filled polymer and to reach an excellent dispersion of the nano-scaled filler in the final article.<br><br>
There is a substantial recent literature on organic-inorganic nanocomposites based on clays or layered silicates such as montmorillonite and synthetic polymers. Polyolefin nanocomposites have been prepared from organic modified clays. The clays used are generally modified with alkyl or dialkyl ammonium ions or amines or in a few cases other onium ions, like for example phosphonium ions. The ammonium ion/amine additives are usually incorporated into the clay structure by a separate solution intercalation step.<br>
These conventional organic modified clays have a number of disadvantages when used for the preparation of polyolefin nanocomposites. Ammonium salts are thermally unstable at temperatures used in polyolefin processing or may be otherwise reactive under processing conditions. These instabilities result in poor processing stability, inferior mechanical properties, discoloration, odor formation and reduced long-term stability in addition to the formation of volatile by-products.<br>
In order to improve the polyolefin nanocomposite formation by melt processing the use of an additional compatibilizer has been proposed, most often a maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene, which in working examples is present as a major component of the final product.<br>
M. Kawasumi et al., Macromolecules 1997, 30, 6333 - 6338 or U.S. 5,973,053 disclose that a polypropylene nanocomposite is obtained when a clay, premodified with octadecylammo-nium salts, is compounded with polypropylene in the presence of polyolefin oligomers containing polar functionality, for example maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene.<br>
Although compatibilizers can improve the stability of nanocomposites mainly with regard to avoiding agglomeration of the filler, the other weaknesses of the nanocomposites are not improved.<br>
It has now been found that improved synthetic polymer materials with better long term thermostability and with reduced odor and reduced undesired discoloration which occurs as a result of the decomposition of the modification agents, can be prepared by the use of a dispersing agent prepared by controlled free radical polymerization.<br><br>
The present invention therefore provides a composition comprising<br>
a)	a synthetic polymer,<br>
b)	a filler, and<br>
c)	a dispersing agent prepared by controlled free radical polymerization (CFRP),<br>
Preferably, component (b) is a filler in nanoparticles.<br>
Of interest are also compositions comprising as component (b) a filler in nanoparticles or a material which produces a filler in nanoparticles under processing conditions.<br>
Component (c) is suitable for intercalating and exfoliating a filler and dispersing the filler in a synthetic polymer matrix, especially a thermoplastic polymer, to form a nanocomposite material.<br>

These metal complexes may be in the free form or fixed on substrates, typically on activated magnesium chloride, titanium(lll) chloride, alumina or silicon oxide. These catalysts may be soluble or insoluble in the polymerisation medium. The catalysts can be used by themselves in the polymerisation or further activators may be used, typically metal alkyls, metal hydrides, metal alkyl halides, metal alkyl oxides or metal alkyloxanes, said metals being elements of groups la, Ha and/or Ilia of the Periodic Table. The activators may be modified conveniently with further ester, ether, amine or silyl ether groups.

formed by coordination polymerization (for example polyethylene, polypropylene), radical polymerization (for example, poly(meth)acrylates and polystyrenics, anionic polymerization (for example, polystyrene, polybutadiene), cationic polymerization (for example, polyisobuty-lene) and group transfer polymerization (for example, poly(meth)acrylates).<br>
The groups R, R1, Z and Z1 are preferably chosen so as to be appropriate for use with the desired monomers or monomer combination and the polymerization method as disclosed in WO-A-98/01478, WO-A-99/05099 and WO-A-99/31144, all of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The synthesis of block copolymers by RAFT polymerization can be carried out in emulsion, solution or suspension in either a batch, semi-batch, continuous, or feed mode. For lowest polydispersity block copolymers, the RAFT agent is typically added before polymerization is commenced. For example, when carried out in a batch mode in solution, the reactor is typically charged with a RAFT agent and a monomer, or a polymerization medium plus the monomer. Block copolymers with broader, yet controlled, polydispersity or with multimodal molecular weight distribution can be produced by controlled addition of the RAFT agent over the course of the polymerization process.<br>
In the case of emulsion or suspension polymerization, the polymerization medium will often be predominantly water and the conventional stabilizers, dispersants and other additives can be present.<br>
For solution polymerization, the polymerization medium can be chosen from a wide range of media to suit the monomer(s) being used. For example, aromatic hydrocarbons, such as, petroleum naphtha or xylenes; ketones, such as, methyl amyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, methyl ethyl ketone or acetone; esters, such as, butyl acetate or hexyl acetate; and glycol ether esters, such as, propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate.<br>
The use of feed polymerization conditions allows the use of RAFT agents with lower chain transfer constants and allows the synthesis of block copolymers that are not readily achieved using batch polymerization processes. If the RAFT polymerization is carried out as a feed system, the reaction can be carried out as follows:<br><br>
The reactor is charged with the chosen polymerization medium, the RAFT agent and optionally a portion of the monomer mixture. Into a separate vessel is placed the remaining monomer mixture. The free radical initiator is dissolved or suspended in polymerization medium in another separate vessel. The medium in the reactor is heated and stirred while the monomer mixture plus the medium and the initiator plus the medium, is introduced, for example by a syringe pump or other pumping device. The rate and duration of feed is largely determined by the quantity of the solution, the desired monomer/RAFT agent/initiator ratio and the rate of the polymerization. When the feed is complete, heating may be continued for an additional period.<br>
Following completion of the polymerization, the block copolymer can be isolated by stripping off the medium and unreacted monomer(s) or by precipitation with a non-solvent. Alternatively, the polymer solution/emulsion can be used as such, if appropriate to its application.<br>
Block and multi-block and gradient copolymers may be prepared by varying the rate of monomer(s) addition and/or by varying the sequence in which the monomer(s) may be added to the polymerization medium. Gradient block may also be prepared in a one-step process by making use of the inherent difference in reactivity of the monomer(s). For gradient block copolymers, it is often desirable to pick comonomers with disparate reactivity ratios. For example, maleic anhydride and styrene or (meth)acrylates.<br>
By appropriate selection of the groups R, R\ Z( Z\ P and X of the RAFT chain transfer agent of formulae l-IV above, block copolymers with specific end functionalities can be readily produced. Block copolymer may be prepared by starting with an existent polymer chain prepared by means other than RAFT polymerization and then modifying the end or other functionality such that the polymer chain is incorporated in a compound of formulae I-IV so as to create a macromolecular RAFT agent that can be chain extended by RAFT polymerization.<br>
The "source of free radicals" or "initiator" suitable for use in the present invention includes those compounds that provide initiating radicals that add to monomers to produce propagating radicals.<br><br>
The amount of initiator used depends upon the desired polydispersity, molecular weight and polymer structure of the resulting polymer. However, generally less than 10 weight percent based on the total amount of monomer mixture is used. Preferably the amount of initiator used is in the range of 0.001 to 5.0 weight percent.<br>
The source of initiating radicals includes such sources as the thermally induced homolytic scission of a suitable initiator, such as peroxides, peroxyesters, or azo compounds; the spontaneous generation from monomer, such as styrene; redox initiating systems; photochemical initiating systems or high energy radiation source, such as electron beam, X-or y-radiation or a combination of these methods. The initiating system is chosen such that under the reaction conditions there is substantially no adverse interaction of the initiator or the initiating radicals with the RAFT agent under the reaction conditions. The initiator should also have the requisite solubility in the reaction medium or the monomer mixture.<br>
Examples of suitable sources of free radicals for the process include azo compounds and peroxides such as for example 2,2'-azobis(isobutyronitrile), 2,2'-azobis(2-cyano-2-butane), dimethyl 2,2'-azobis(methyl isobutyrate), 4,4'-azobis(4-cyanopentanoic acid), 4,4'-azobis(4-cyanopentan-1-ol), 1,1'-azobis(cyclohexanecar1x&gt;nitrile), 2-(t-butylazo)-2-cyanopropane1 2,2'-azobis[2-methyl-N-(1,1)-bis(hydoxymethyl)-2-hydroxyethyI] propionamide, 2,2,-azobis[2-methyl-N-hydroxyethyl)]-propionamide, 2,2'-azobis(N,N,-dimethyleneisobutyramidine) di-hydrochloride, 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride, 2,2,-azobis(N,N,-dimethylene-isobutyramine), 2,2'-azobis(2-methyl-N-[1,1 -bis(hydroxymethyl)-2-hydroxyethyl] propionamide), 2,2,-azobis(2-methyl-N-[1l1-bis(hydroxymethyl) ethyl] propionamide), 2,2,-azobis[2-methyl-N-(2-hydroxyethyl) propionamide], 2,2,-azobis(isobutyramide) dihydrate, 2,2'-azobis-(2,2,4-trimethylpentane), 2,2'-azobis(2-methylpropane), tert-butyl peroxyacetate, tert-butyl peroxybenzoate, t-butyl peroxyoctoate, tert-butyl peroxyneodecanoate, tert-butylperoxy isobutyrate, tert-amyl peroxypivalate, tert-butyl peroxypivalate, dMsopropyl peroxydicarbo-nate, dicyclohexyl peroxydicarbonate, dicumyi peroxide, dibenzoyl peroxide, dilauroyl peroxide, potassium peroxydisulfate, ammonium peroxydisulfate, di-t-butyl hyponitrite, or dicumyi hyponitrite.<br>
Photochemical initiator systems are chosen to have the requisite solubility in the reaction medium or monomer mixture and have an appropriate quantum yield for radical production under  the  conditions  of the  polymerization.   Examples  include  benzoin  derivatives,<br><br>
benzophenone, acyl phosphine oxides, and photo-redox systems. Free radicals may also be derived by direct photolysis of the compound of formula Mil.<br>
Redox initiator systems are chosen to have the requisite solubility in the reaction medium or monomer mixture and have an appropriate rate of radical production under the conditions of the polymerization; these initiating systems can include combinations of the following oxidants and reductants: Oxidants: potassium peroxydisuifate, hydrogen peroxide, and tert-butyl hydroperoxide. Reductants: iron (II), titanium (III), potassium thiosulfite, and potassium bisulfite.<br>
Other suitable initiating systems are described in recent texts. See, for example, Moad and Solomon The Chemistry of Free Radical Polymerization", Pergamon, London, 1995, pp 53-95.<br>
Compositions which are of interest include those comprising as component (c) a block or comb copolymer having at least one clay compatible block and at least one matrix polymer compatible block prepared by controlled free radical polymerization.<br>
Preferably, a clay compatible block is based on hydrophilic or "clayophilic" monomers which<br><br><br>
The molecular weight of the acrylic copolymer is preferably between 1000 and 100000 and the polydispersity between 1.05 and 3.0. More preferably the molecular weight is between 2000 and 20000 and the polydispersity is between 1.05 and 2.0.<br>

The costabilizers are added, for example, in concentrations of 0.01 to 10%, relative to the total weight of the synthetic polymer to be stabilized.<br>
Preferred further additives are phenolic antioxidants, light-stabilizers, processing stabilizers, solvents, pigments, dyes, plasticizers, compatibilizers, toughening agents and/or thixotropic agents.<br>
In addition to the nano fillers other fillers may be used as reinforcing agents (item 12 in the list), for example talc, calcium carbonate, hydrotalcite, mica, kaolin, metal hydroxides, especially aluminium hydroxide or magnesium hydroxide. These are added to the synthetic polymers in concentrations, for example, of from 0.01 to 40 %, based on the overall weight of the synthetic polymers to be stabilized.<br>

Glass fibers as reinforcing agents are added to the synthetic polymers in concentrations, judiciously, of from 0.01 to 20 %, based on the overall weight of the synthetic polymers to be stabilized.<br><br>
Further preferred compositions comprise in addition to components (a), (b) and (c) further additives as well, especially alkaline earth metal salts of higher fatty acids, for example calcium stearate.<br>
As a conventional stabilizer combination for processing synthetic polymers, for example polyolefins, to form corresponding mouldings, the combination of a phenolic antioxidant with a secondary antioxidant based on an organic phosphite or phosphonite is recommended.<br>
Incorporation of components (b) and (c) and, if desired, further additives into the synthetic polymers is carried out by known methods, for example before or during moulding or else by applying the dissolved or dispersed compounds to the synthetic polymer, if appropriate with subsequent slow evaporation of the solvent.<br>
The present invention also relates to a nanocomposite material in the form of a masterbatch or concentrate comprising component (a) in an amount of from 5 to 90%, component (b) in an amount of from 5 to 80%, and component (c) in an amount of from 0.5 to 50% by weight.<br>

Components (b) and (c), with or without further additives, can be incorporated in pure form or encapsulated in waxes, oils or polymers into the synthetic polymer.<br>
Components (b) and (c), with or without further additives, can also be sprayed onto the synthetic polymer. It is able to dilute other additives (for example the conventional additives indicated above) or their melts so that they too can be sprayed together with these additives onto the polymer. Addition by spraying on during the deactivation of the polymerization catalysts is particularly advantageous, it being possible to carry out spraying using, for example, the steam used for deactivation.<br>
In the case of spherically polymerized polyolefins it may, for example, be advantageous to apply components (b) and (c), with or without other additives, by spraying.<br><br>

Thus, a further embodiment of the present invention relates to a shaped article, in particular a film, pipe, profile, bottle, tank or container, fiber containing a composition as described above.<br>
A further embodiment of the present invention relates to a molded article containing a composition as described above. The molding is in particular effected by injection, blow, compression, roto-molding or slush-molding or extrusion.<br>
The present invention also relates to a process for the preparation of a synthetic polymer nanocomposite material which comprises melt mixing a mixture of a) a synthetic polymer, b) a filler, and c) a dispersing agent prepared by controlled free radical polymerization (CFRP).<br>
The melt mixing can be carried out in any beatable container equipped with a stirrer, for example in a closed apparatus such as a kneader, mixer or stirred vessel. The incorporation is preferably carried out in an extruder or in a kneader. It is immaterial whether processing takes place in an inert atmosphere or in the presence of oxygen.<br><br>
The addition of components (a), (b) and (c) can be carried out in all customary mixing machines in which the polymer is melted and mixed with the additives. Suitable machines are known to those skilled in the art. They are predominantly mixers, kneaders and extruders. The process is preferably carried out in an extruder by introducing the additive during processing. Particularly preferred processing machines are single-screw extruders, contraro-tating and corotating twin-screw extruders, planetary-gear extruders, ring extruders or cok-neaders. It is also possible to use processing machines provided with at least one gas removal compartment to which a vacuum can be applied. Suitable extruders and kneaders are described, for example, in Handbuch der Kunststoffextrusion, Vol. 1, Grundlagen, Editors F. Hensen, W. Knappe, H. Potente, 1989, pp. 3-7, ISBN:3-446-14339-4; and Vol. 2 Extrusionsanlagen 1986, ISBN 3-446-14329-7. For example, the screw length is 1 -60 screw diameters, preferably 35 - 48 screw diameters. The rotational speed of the screw is preferably 10 to 600 rotations per minute (rpm), for example 25 - 300 rpm. The maximum throughput is dependent on the screw diameter, the rotational speed and the driving force. The process of the present invention can also be carried out at a level lower than maximum throughput by varying the parameters mentioned or employing weighing machines delivering dosage amounts. If a plurality of components are added, these can be premixed or added individually.<br>
Also of interest is a process for the preparation of a synthetic polymer nanocomposite material, wherein the melt mixing of the components (synthetic polymer, filler and dispersing agent prepared by controlled free radical polymerization) occurs between 120 and 290°C, preferably between 140 and 250°C, for example between 170 and 230°C.<br>
The present invention also relates to synthetic polymer nanocomposites obtained by the above mentioned process.<br>
The preferred components (b) and (c), and optionally futher additives, in the process for the preparation of a synthetic polymer nanocomposite material are the same as those described for the composition.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention is also the use of a dispersing agent prepared by controlled free radical polymerization to intercalate and exfoliate a filler and disperse the filler in a synthetic polymer matrix to form a nanocomposite material.<br><br>
The preferred dispersing agent, filler and synthetic polymer, and optionally further additives, for this use are the same as those described for the composition.<br>
The following examples illustrate the invention further. Parts or percentages relate to weight.<br>

Example 2: Preparation of polypropylene nanocomposites in a batch mixer based on unmodified sodium montmorillonite.<br><br>
50 g of polypropylene [Basell KY 6100 (RTM)], is blended with 0.25 % of Irganox 1010 (RTM) (pentaerythritol tetrakis[3-(3,5-di-tert-butyM-hydroxyphenyl)-propionate]) and 0.25 % of Irgafos 168 (RTM) (tris(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl) phosphite), 5 % of a montmorillonite clay [Cloisite (Na+) (RTM) obtained from Southern Clay Industries] and 2.5 % of a dispersing agent prepared by controlled free radical polymerisation (CFRP) according to Table 1 in a plastic cup and then added to a batch mixer operating at 25 rpm and 180°C, the mixture is then taken to 50 rpm for 10 minutes. Small scale injection moulding is performed with a CS-183 MMX Minimax moulder. The mixing chamber is preheated to 230 °C and the mould is oven heated to 120°C for one hour prior to injection moulding. Approximately 5 g of the material is placed in the mixing chamber and heated for 4 to 5 minutes. A small shot is taken form the CS-183 MMX Minimax moulder prior to placing the mould in position. Six tensile bars with the dimensions 18 mm by 5 mm by 0.85 mm are produced for each of the 5 g material.<br>
Tensile testing is performed according to ASTM D 638 with a Rheometrics mini material tensile tester [Minimat 2000 (RTM)] equipped with a 1000 N load cell (40 mm/min). The results are summarized in Table 2.<br><br><br>
a)	Comparative Example.<br>
b)	Example according to the invention.<br>
c)	Interlayer distance determined by X-ray diffraction.<br>
d)	Normalized modulus of elasticity relative to polypropylene processed under similar conditions (= 1.0).<br>
e)	Normalized elongation at break relative to polypropylene processed under similar conditions (=1.0).<br>
f)	n.d. means "not determined".<br>
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra show that all copolymers synthesized via CFRP according to Table 2 intercalate the used clay in the direct melt blending experiments in the batch mixer. This is demonstrated by an increase in d-spacing of from 10 A (comparative Example 2b) to 13 A (Examples 2c and 2d according to the invention). The elasticity modulus of samples is enhanced by 4 - 32 % with respect to polypropylene without dispersing agent and/or filler. Surprisingly, the elongation at break is also enhanced by 26 - 30 %.<br>

Example 4: Preparation of polypropylene nanocomposites in a twin screw extruder.<br>
Processing is carried out with a Japan Steel Works 30 mm diameter twin screw extruder of L/D ratio 42 (JSW TEX 30) that comprises ten temperature controlled barrel sections each<br><br>
with L/D of 3.5, three unheated sampling zones with L/D 1.167, and a cooled feed block with L/D 3.5. The screw configuration consists of a combination of mixing, kneading and conveying elements familiar to those skilled in the art. Materials are fed into the extruder via a JSW TTF20 gravimetric feeder (Feed 1) and a K-Tron KQX gravimetric feeder (Feed 2). The JSW TEX 30 is operated in a co rotating (intermeshing self wiping) mode with throughput of 10 kg/hr and a screw speed of 200 rpm. Vacuum venting is applied to the final barrel section. The extrudate is cooled in a water filled strand bath and pelletized.<br>
In a first step a 10 wt% clay masterbatch is prepared. Feed 1 comprises a dry blend of polypropylene [Basell HP400N (RTM)] and a stabilizer which is composed of 0.25 wt% of Irganox 1010 (RTM) (pentaerythritol tetrakis[3-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate]) and 0.25 wt% of Irgafos 168 (RTM) (tris(2l4-di-tert-butylphenyl)phosphite). Feed 2 comprises a blend of the clay [Cloisite (Na+) (RTM) obtained from Southern Clay Industries] and the non-ionic surfactant in the ratio defined in Table 4. All barrel sections are heated to 170°C.<br>
In the second step the masterbatch is let down to the required clay level (see Table 4) by blending the masterbatch (Feed 2) with further polypropylene plus stabilizer (Feed 1). The first barrel section is heated at 180°C the remaining barrel sections are heated at 200°C.<br>
Injection moulding of the extruded samples are preformed with a Cincinnati Milacron VS55 28 mm diameter injection moulding machine comprising four temperature controlled sections of L/D23/1. The machine is operated at a clamp force of 50 tons and at a maximum injection pressure of 2005 bar.<br>
Tensile testing is performed according to ISO 521 using an Instron 5500R material tensile tester. Tensile properties (vs polypropylene) for nanocomposite prepared with a ratio of copolymer: clay of 1:5 are summarized in Tables 4 and 5.<br><br><br>
a)	Comparative Example.<br>
