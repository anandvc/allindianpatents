				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates, in particular, to the field of<br>
the distribution of electrical energy to a plurality of<br>
subscribers distributed within the territory. The invention is,<br>
however, also applicable in more general terms to other services<br>
such as, for example, the distribution of water, gas or to tele-<br>
heating. Thus, when mention will be made in the following of<br>
distribution services of electrical energy, it is understood<br>
that the teachings of the invention are easily applicable to the<br>
distribution of other services as well.<br>
Technological Background<br>
Generally, meters for measuring consumption of electric energy<br>
are located in close proximity to the loads consuming the<br>
energy, e.g. in a generally accessible area of a home of a<br>
subscriber. The control meter is usually installed between a<br>
power distribution network and a subscriber line and measures<br>
the amount of electric energy drawn via the subscriber line.<br>
Conventionally, authorized personnel manually read counter<br>
values of the control meter in predetermined time intervals,<br>
with the readings being used for billing subscribers for the<br>
consumed electric energy.<br>
To reduce costs associated with reading the meters, techniques<br>
have been developed for remote control of the supply of<br>
subscribers with electrical energy. General problems of this<br>
type have already been described, for example, in Italian patent<br>
No. 1 232 195, filed on October 26, 19B8 by the present<br>
Applicant, or in US patent application US-A-4,803,632.<br>
The approach which these and other different studies have in<br>
common can be summarized in an architecture using heterogeneous<br>
forms of communication to establish a communication between the<br><br><br>
peripheral points of the system (meters at the subscriber<br>
points), with a supervision center being mainly responsible for<br>
the control of the procedures considered in each case to be<br>
useful for attaining the objects.<br>
Such a connection is obtained by the direct communication<br>
between the supervision center (rn general a server with high<br>
processor performance) and the peripheral meters, as is<br>
described, for example, in WO 98/10299, or by interposing at<br>
least one intermediate hierarchical level in this pyramid, as is<br>
suggested in WO 98/10394. Examples of these proposals can also<br>
be found in other patents such as e.g. EP-A2-0 723 358 or WO<br>
99/4 6564. The general problem area of remotely controlling the<br>
supply of electrical energy is also dealt with in the recent<br>
Italian patent application No. MI2001A.002726 as filed on<br>
December 20, 2001 in the name of the present applicant<br>
As noted above, meters are generally installed in an area<br>
accessible by subscribers and others and therefore it becomes an<br>
important issue to avoid fraudulent manipulations to the control<br>
meter aiming at drawing electric energy, which is not accounted<br>
for.<br>
The most common ways to commit energy fraud require the removal<br>
of the metering point, the manipulation of the control meter to<br>
alter the measuring constant and/or circumventing the control<br>
meter by directly contacting the terminals the mains power<br>
supply line.<br>
To counter these attempts of fraud, the technologies known today<br>
provide one single system consisting of mounting the apparatus<br>
for measuring the energy consumption on a support base which is<br>
closed by a lid fixed thereon by means of a<br>
seal. The discovery of the break of the seal proves the<br>
committed, fraud that is then sanctioned according to the facts<br>
of the case.<br><br><br>
This system has been considered to be sufficient in the past,<br>
when it was customary that the control meter was personally<br>
controlled and looked at by an operator at least once a month,<br>
even if only to read off the consumption. However, this system<br>
has proven to be inadequate when the energy supply companies<br>
considered the systematic control once a month of all meters in<br>
the network to be too costly and carried them out less<br>
frequently, for example, by asking each subscriber via telephone<br>
about his consumption.<br>
At the current state of the art, which permits, as described in<br>
the aforementioned patent application No. MI2001A.002726, to<br>
remotely read the consumption and even to control the energy<br>
supply in real time, including the initiation and termination<br>
thereof, the safety system support based on a seal and the<br>
direct control of the control meter does not only become<br>
inadequate but it is even totally out of the question to propose<br>
such system.<br>
A method and system for sensing removal of a utility meter from<br>
its socket is known from US 5,523,559, according. to which the<br>
removal of a meter can be detected by a tampering detection<br>
unit, wherein the tampering detection unit is included entirely<br>
within a base or base extension and external to the meter.<br>
Further, a device for maintaining a device housing is known from<br>
EP 0 447 615 A1, according to which a sensor detects a position<br>
of a closure device for example used in meters for metering<br>
electricity, so that it may be detected when a housing is opened<br>
and the sensed state may be transmitted to the distributor.<br>
Summary of the Invention.<br>
 It is an object of the present invention to provide for an<br>
improved detection of attempts of fraudulent manipulations of<br>
control meters.<br><br><br>
A control meter for controlling the supply of services, in<br>
particular the supply of electric energy, comprises a support<br>
base anchored with which is a main power supply line, a metering<br>
group detachable from the support base and comprising a<br>
measurement apparatus interposed between the main power supply<br>
line and a subscriber line; and a safety anchorage comprising<br>
mechanical means associated with the metering group and movable<br>
into a locking position for engagement with the support base<br>
when the metering group is mounted on the support base; and an<br>
interrupter for generating an activation signal upon activation<br>
by the mechanical means, wherein the mechanical means is<br>
arranged to activate the interrupter when the mechanical means<br>
is released from the locking position for detaching the metering<br>
group from the support base.<br>
Advantageously, the mechanical means further comprise a<br>
retaining spanner movable into retaining means in the support<br>
base in the locking position, to form a locking bar against<br>
displacement of the metering group of the control meter relative<br>
to the support base. The mechanical means may further comprise a<br>
locking bar mandrel cooperating with the retaining spanner and<br>
the interrupter of the safety anchorage such that the<br>
blocking/unblocking movement of the locking bar mandrel<br>
corresponds to the opening/closing movement of the interrupter.<br>
The locking bar mandrel may be arranged coaxially to the<br>
retaining spanner which, when the mechanical means is in the<br>
locking position, is urged against a seat of the support base to<br>
form a locking bar against a parallel movement of the metering<br>
group relative to the support base.<br>
The retaining means may further comprise seats and a threaded<br>
bushing for receiving a threaded portion of the retaining<br>
spanner when the mechanical means is moved into the locking<br>
 position.<br>
 Spring means may be provided, acting on the locking bar mandrel<br>
so as to move the locking bar mandrel in a direction away from<br><br><br>
the support base when the retaining spanner is released from the<br>
retaining means.<br>
The interrupter and the mechanical means may be located<br>
substantially inside a sealed container with part of the locking<br>
bar mandrel and the retaining spanner being accessible though an<br>
opening in the sealed container; and the locking bar mandrel<br>
comprises a lid covering the retaining spanner, the retaining<br>
spanner being accessible for release from the locking position<br>
only by breaking the lid.<br>
The interrupter may be formed by a pair of flexible metal sheets<br>
resiliently contacting each other, and the mechanical means<br>
being provided with a wing apt to interpose itself between the<br>
flexible metal sheets in the locking position.<br>
In an alternative, the interrupter of the safety anchorage is<br>
formed by a micro-interrupter, the command button being<br>
activated by an oscillating arm moved by the mechanical means.<br>
In another alternative the interrupter of the safety anchorage<br>
is formed by an optical transmitter and an optical receiver,<br>
forming a pair of optical devices with a transmitter-receiver<br>
coupling, and the mechanical means being provided with a wing<br>
apt to interrupt the transmitter-receiver coupling by<br>
interposing itself into the path between the optical transmitter<br>
and an optical receiver in the locking position.<br>
Moreover, the metering group may be mountable on the support<br>
base by means of a bayonet-type attachment system with which the<br>
safety anchorage cooperates, the bayonet-type attachment system<br>
comprising a pair of hook-like members integral with one of the<br>
support base and the bottom wall of the body of the meter, and,<br>
two recessed meiabers formed in the other one of the support base<br>
and the bottom wall of the body of the meter, facing the hook-<br>
like members, whereby the engagement of the hook-like teeth in<br>
the recessed members takes place due to a displacement of the<br><br><br>
body of the control meter parallel to the respective support<br>
base.<br>
One of the support base and the metering group may comprise a<br>
series of resilient, fork-shaped supply terminals and the other<br>
one of the support base and the metering group comprises an<br>
opposing series of mandrel-shaped control meter input terminals<br>
for the subscriber line, whereby the anchoring movement of the<br>
bayonet-type attachment system also causes the mandrel-like<br>
terminals to be engaged in the opposing fork-shaped terminals.<br>
The interrupter may form part of an electronic circuit that is<br>
associated with translating means to transmit the activation<br>
signal to a local control unit or remote central control, and<br>
may be arranged to irreversibly command, upon actuation, the<br>
opening of a power switch 52 of the subscriber side of the<br>
supply line.<br>
The metering group may further comprise an electronic circuit<br>
for the memorization of the exchange of state of the<br>
interrupter, and may be supplied by a battery having a similar<br>
service life as the meter.<br>
The metering group may include a measurement apparatus<br>
comprising translating means for transforming the values of the<br>
effected measurements into data to be transmitted via<br>
communication lines, and communication means associated with the<br>
translating means to perform an exchange of measurement data and<br>
possible other processing data with a remote central control<br>
connected to the control meter by means of a communication line.<br>
The activation signal may command a local microprocessor or a<br>
microprocessor at a remote central control, provided with<br>
software for effecting the initiation and interruption of the<br>
energy supply, to interrupt the power supply to the control<br>
meter by opening the power switch.<br><br>
Moreover, the software of the local control unit may provide the<br>
repetition of the control of the signal identifying the occurred<br>
actuation of the interrupter and/or of the electronic circuit<br>
(14), before emitting the command for interrupting the supply,<br>
and the repetition of the control may also provide the reset of<br>
the memorization circuit.<br>
The invention allows to positively obstruct acts of fraud and<br>
thus to provide a control meter which is able to permit the<br>
remote-control of the "open/closed" state in situations of fraud<br>
or rather attempted fraud and is capable of unequivocally<br>
proving the occurrence of fraud or attempted fraud.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
In the following a first embodiment of the invention will be<br>
described with regard to Fig. la and lb.<br>
Figs. 1a and 1b schematically show longitudinal sections of a<br>
control meter according to an embodiment of the invention, with<br>
Fig. la illustrating the control meter in the locked position -<br>
and Fig. lb illustrating the control meter in the unlocked<br>
position.<br>
Fig. 1a illustrates a control meter comprising a support base 1<br>
and a metering group 2. The support base may for example be<br>
fixedly mounted to a wall or control meter compartment, e.g. in<br>
a subscriber's home. The metering group 2 is detachably mounted<br>
on the support base 1, to be removed for servicing the control<br>
meter. Supply terminals 23 of a power supply line 20 are<br>
anchored with the support base 1.<br>
The metering group comprises a measurement apparatus (not<br>
shown), interposed between the main power supply line 20 and a<br>
subscriber line 50. The measurement apparatus operates to<br>
account for electric energy drawn by a subscriber through the<br>
subscriber line. The subscriber line 50 and measurement <br>
apparatus are connected to the supply terminals 23 of the main<br><br><br>
power supply line via control meter input terminals 51 and, if<br>
the measurement group is mounted on the support base at the<br>
appropriate location, the terminals 23 and 51 are in contact<br>
with one another and electric power can be drawn by loads (not<br>
shown) connected to the subscriber line 50, such as appliances<br>
and similar. The subscriber line 50 is further controlled by a<br>
power switch 52, allowing to turn on and off a power supply to<br>
the subscriber line terminals 53, e.g. as controlled by a local<br>
control unit of the control meter or a remote central control<br>
operator for initiating and terminating a subscriber contract,<br>
and to turn off the power supply upon detecting an attempt of<br>
fraud, as detailed further below. The power switch 52 may be<br>
arranged in the metering group 2, as shown in Fig. la or, in an<br>
alternative, the power switch 52 may be arranged in an external<br>
protected compartment, or in the meter itself.<br>
The metering group further comprises a safety anchorage for<br>
ensuring that the metering group is securely mounted on the<br>
support base. The safety anchorage prevents that fraudulent<br>
manipulations of the metering group, e.g. to avoid the drawing<br>
of electric power which is not accounted by the measurement<br>
apparatus, remain unnoticed.<br>
The safety anchorage comprises mechanical means 30, associated<br>
with the metering group and movable into a locking position in a<br>
recess 31 of the support base, for locking engagement with the<br>
support base when the metering group 2 is mounted on the support<br>
base 1, i.e. the mechanical means can only be introduced into<br>
the recess 31, if the metering group 2 is properly positioned on<br>
the support base 1.<br>
Further, the safety anchorage comprises an interrupter 40 for<br>
generating an activation signal upon actuation by the mechanical<br>
means 30, wherein the mechanical means activates the interrupter<br>
when the mechanical means is removed from the locking position<br>
in the recess 31, e.g. in an attempt to detach the metering<br>
group from the support base.<br><br><br>
In Fig. la the mechanical means 30 is shown locked in the<br>
locking position and the switch 40 is shown in a non-activated<br>
position, indicated by the depressed switch element 41, being<br>
held in a depressed position between the mechanical means 30 and<br>
the interrupter 40. The switch element 41 can for example be<br>
resiliently urged by a spring in an upward direction in Fig. la<br>
while being held in a depressed position by the fact that the<br>
mechanical means 30 is in the locked position.<br>
Furthermore, in the locking position shown in Fig. 1a, the power<br>
switch 52 of the subscriber line 50 is maintained closed, and<br>
electric power can flow from a supply network to the loads<br>
connected to the subscriber line 50, to be measured by the<br>
measurement apparatus.<br>
The mechanical means 30 can for example be a retaining spanner<br>
or bolt with a threaded portion, the threaded portion for<br>
insertion into a threaded bushing in the recess 31. Thus, to<br>
bring the mechanical means 30 into the locked position, simply a<br>
screwdriver could be used.<br>
In the example shown in Fig. 1a it is the flat-shaped head of<br>
the mechanical means 30 which functions as a means to keep the<br>
switch element 41 in a depressed, non-activated position,<br>
however, any other means for holding the switch portion in this<br>
position could be used, such as any other protrusion at the<br>
mechanical means 30 or element to maintain the interrupter in<br>
the non-activated position, when the mechanical means is in the<br>
locked position.<br>
Turning to Fig. 1b, showing the control meter in the unlocked<br>
condition, the mechanical means 30 is removed from the recess 31<br>
 in the support base, and with the release operation the<br>
interrupter is activated, as indicated by the upward moved<br>
switch element 41. For example, when the mechanical means 30 is<br>
removed from the recess 31, a spring may move the switch element<br>
41 in an upward direction, activating the interrupter 40.<br><br><br>
It is an important, feature that only with the mechanical means<br>
30 in the position shown in Fig. lb, i.e. removed from the<br>
recess 31 in the support base, the metering group 2 can be<br>
removed from the support base 1.<br>
Further, with the release operation of the mechanical means 30<br>
the interrupter 40 is activated and a corresponding activation<br>
signal is generated. The activation signal indicates that<br>
someone attempts to remove the metering group from the support<br>
base and it can appropriately be processed.<br>
In the example shown in Fig. lb, the activation signal is used<br>
to command an opening of the power switch 52 of the subscriber<br>
line 50 via a transmission line 42, turning off a supply of<br>
electric power to the subscriber line terminals 53 and thus to<br>
the external portion of the subscriber line and therewith to the<br>
subscriber. The interrupter may be arranged to irreversibly<br>
command, upon actuation, the opening-of the power switch 52 of<br>
the subscriber line. Accordingly, fraud by drawing electric<br>
energy from the subscriber line terminals 53 without being fed<br>
through the measurement apparatus is prevented.<br>
The power switch 52 may be a two-stage switch with a lever for<br>
manual activation/deactivation of the power supply and with a<br>
switch element driven by the interrupter for enabling/disabling<br>
the manual activation of the power supply. Further, the power<br>
switch 52 may form part of a fuse device for deactivation of the<br>
power supply in case of over current, or may be constituted by<br>
an element for triggering the fuse device.<br>
In addition thereto, or as an alternative, the activation signal<br>
may also be forwarded to a local control unit or remote central<br>
control via a transmission line for further processing. The<br>
remote control center may also be used to remotely control the<br>
power switch 52 to open/close the subscriber line. It is noted<br>
that the remote control center may also control the power switch<br>
52 to initiate or terminate a utility supply contract.<br><br><br>
Still further, the activation signal and further data in<br>
association therewith, such as a time stamp of the occurrence of<br>
the activation signal/ a counter value of the measurement<br>
apparatus and similar may be stored in non-volatile memory means<br>
in the local control unit of the control meter and/or at the<br>
remote control center.<br>
In an alternate embodiment it may be preferred to irreversibly<br>
open the power switch 52 upon a first activation of the<br>
interrupter so as to prevent closing the power switch 52 upon<br>
again mounting the metering group on the support base. Further,<br>
a reset may preferably be devisable only by an operator via the<br>
remote control center or a similar entity.<br>
Preferably, the safety anchorage is not accessible from the<br>
outside of the metering group, i.e., securely housed within a<br>
sealed casing of the metering group. This avoids access to and<br>
fraudulent manipulation of the safety anchorage in an attempt of<br>
unauthorized drawing of electric energy.<br>
The interrupter, while in Figs. 1a and 1b shown as a micro-<br>
switch, can be of any type suitable for detecting a removal of<br>
the mechanical means 30 from the recess 31 in the support base.<br>
Still further, while Fig. 1a and 1b show a recess in the support<br>
base for receiving the mechanical means 30, in alternative<br>
embodiments any other means for locking engagement with the<br>
mechanical means may be devised. For example, the support base<br>
may be provided with a protrusion extending into the metering<br>
group when mounted on the support base, and the mechanical means<br>
30 may be brought into locking engagement with this protrusion.<br>
Thus, many different arrangements are possible, and the<br>
 invention is not limited to the exact mechanical arrangement<br>
shown in Figs. 1a and 1b.<br>
In the following a further embodiment of the invention will be<br>
described with regard to Fig. 2.<br><br><br>
Fig. 2 shows a diagrammatic, exploded view in perspective of a<br>
control meter, particularly illustrating elements of a safety<br>
anchorage.<br>
The control meter of Fig. 2 comprises a support base 1 which can<br>
be attached to the wall, for example, by means of a series of V<br>
dowel-type screws in a manner known in the art. The support base<br>
includes an end portion and terminals of a main power supply<br>
line, e.g. operated by an energy providing organization, to<br>
allow the drawing of energy by a subscriber<br>
Further, the control meter comprises a metering group 2<br>
comprising a box-like sealed casing accommodating the elements<br>
of the control meter for measuring operations. The sealed casing<br>
prevents access to the elements of the control meter for safety<br>
reasons, e.g. to prevent electric shock, and for security<br>
reasons, i.e. to prevent fraudulent manipulations to the meter.<br>
The metering group 2 includes a measuring apparatus for<br>
measuring a consumption of electric energy by the subscriber via<br>
a subscriber line connected to the terminals of the main power<br>
supply line through the metering apparatus, as known in the art.<br>
Further, the metering group may include translating means for<br>
transforming the measured values of the effected measurements<br>
into data and transmitting means for exchanging data with a<br>
remote control center by means of an communication line, e.g.<br>
for remote accounting at the remote central control and<br>
subscriber billing. Further, the control meter preferably<br>
comprises a remotely operable device for<br>
interrupting/reactivating the power supply circuits. For.<br>
example', the subscriber line power switch 52 may be remotely<br>
operable via a command from the remote control center, in<br>
addition to being operable via the interrupter.<br>
 The metering group 2 is mountable on the support base 1 by means<br>
of a bayonet-type attachment system or any other attachment<br>
system using screws, hooks and the like. In the mounted<br>
position, the subscriber can draw electric energy from the main<br><br><br>
power supply line via the measuring apparatus and the subscriber<br>
line. In the detached position with the control meter removed<br>
from the support base, the terminals of the main power supply<br>
line are not in contact with the input terminals of the control<br>
meter, i.e., the subscriber line 50 and the drawing of electric<br>
energy through the metering, group is not any longer possible.<br>
However, as in the detached position the terminals of the main<br>
power supply line may be freely accessible, to prevent<br>
unauthorized drawing of electric energy, means must be provided<br>
to prevent or at least detect an unauthorized removal of the<br>
metering group from the support base.<br>
The control meter therefore comprises a safety anchorage, shown<br>
in Fig. 2 in the exploded view. The safety anchorage comprising<br>
mechanical means associated with the metering group and movable<br>
into a locking position for engagement with the support base 1<br>
when the metering group is mounted on the support base 1, and an<br>
interrupter for generating an activation signal upon actuation<br>
by the mechanical means. The mechanical means and the<br>
interrupter interact to generate an activation signal when the<br>
mechanical means is released from the locking position for<br>
detaching the metering group from the support base.<br>
The safety anchorage of the embodiment of Fig. 2 preferably<br>
consists of the following elements in association with the<br>
measuring group:<br>
A hollow seat 5 in the form of a bushing, integral with the<br>
bottom 2a of the group 2.<br>
A mandrel-shaped hollow body 6, slidably accommodated in the<br>
seat 5. The mandrel 6 is more precisely provided with an<br>
axial perforation of small diameter in the lower part that<br>
enlarges in the upper part, forming a resting shoulder 6a.<br>
Spring means 7 which urge the mandrel 6 upwardly.<br><br>
A retaining spanner 8 consisting preferably of a bolt,<br>
accommodated:between the lower part of the axial cavity of<br>
the mandrel 6, with its head resting on the shoulder 6a.<br>
When the retaining spanner is loosened, its rising head<br>
pulls out the entire body 6, urged by the spring means, thus<br>
releasing it from its engagement with the support base 1.<br>
A retainer part 15 with an opening in the middle portion<br>
thereof for allowing access to the retaining spanner 8<br>
below, e.g. with a screwdriver. The retainer part 15 is<br>
insertable into an opening of the mandrel-shaped hollow body<br>
6. Further, the opening of the retainer part 15 is smaller<br>
as the diameter of the retaining spanner 8, such that, when<br>
the retainer spanner 8 is loosened, its rising head engages<br>
with the retainer part 15 to force the mandrel 6 upward, in<br>
addition to the force by the spring means.<br>
A lid 9 for sealing the upper part of the axial cavity of<br>
the mandrel 6. The lid is retained when it is being<br>
positioned in its accommodation above the retaining spanner<br>
such that its removal entails the break of the lid..<br>
- A wing 10 of insulating material, integral with the mandrel<br>
6 and acting preferably in the radial direction towards the<br>
exterior of the mandrel 6.<br>
And an interrupter 11, formed by a pair of metal sheets<br>
contacting each other and being moved apart by the wing 10,<br>
when the mandrel is urged downwards, the disposition and<br>
function of. which will be described in more detail below.<br>
Further, the safety anchorage of the embodiment of Fig. 2<br>
comprises the following elements in the support base 1, on the<br>
same axis as the mandrel 6, to cooperate with the previously<br>
described elements in the measuring group:<br><br><br>
A seat 12, constituting retaining means, for<br>
accommodating the lower end of the aforementioned mandrel<br>
6.<br>
And a seat 13, constituting retaining means, for<br>
anchoring the retaining spanner 8, which is comprised of<br>
an internally threaded bushing when the spanner 8 is a<br>
bolt.<br>
The elements described above interact in such a manner that an<br>
activation signal is output, if the retaining spanner is removed<br>
from the seats 12 and 13.<br>
Briefly, the retaining spanner is movable into the retaining<br>
means, i.e. the seat 13, in the locking position, to form a<br>
locking bar against displacement of the metering group relative<br>
to the support base. Further, the locking bar mandrel cooperates<br>
with the retaining spanner and the interrupter of the safety<br>
anchorage such that the blocking/unblocking movement of the<br>
locking bar mandrel corresponds to the opening/closing movement<br>
of the interrupter. Moreover, the locking bar mandrel is<br>
arranged coaxially to the retaining spanner which, when the<br>
mechanical means is in the locking position, is urged against a<br>
seat of the support base to form a locking bar against a<br>
parallel movement of the metering group relative to the support<br>
base. The retaining means may comprise a threaded bushing for<br>
receiving a threaded portion of the retaining spanner when the<br>
mechanical means is moved into the locking position.<br>
Further, the spring means act on the locking bar mandrel so as<br>
to move the locking bar mandrel in a direction away from the<br>
support base when the retaining spanner is released from the<br>
seat 13.<br>
The pair of flexible metal sheets resiliently contacting each<br>
other forms the interrupter, and the wing is arranged to<br>
interpose itself between the flexible metal sheets in the<br>
locking position. The interrupter and the mechanical means are<br><br><br>
located substantially inside a sealed container with part of the<br>
locking bar mandrel and the retaining spanner being accessible<br>
though an opening in the sealed container; and the lid covers<br>
the retaining spanner, the retaining spanner being accessible<br>
for release from the locking position only by breaking the lid.<br>
In an alternative the interrupter of the safety anchorage is<br>
formed by an optical transmitter and an optical receiver,<br>
forming a pair of optical devices with a transmitter-receiver<br>
coupling, wherein a signal light is transmitted from the optical<br>
transmitter to the optical receiver. Further, in this<br>
alternative the mechanical means is provided with a wing apt to<br>
interrupt the transmitter-receiver coupling by interposing :<br>
itself into the path between the optical transmitter and an:<br>
optical receiver in the locking position. The remaining features<br>
and operations are substantially as outlined above. ;<br>
i<br>
The embodiment shown in. Fig. 2 and its operation will now be<br>
further described with regard to Figs. 3a, 3b and Figs 4a, |4b,<br>
respectively.<br>
Fig. 3a shows a detail of the control meter of Fig. 2 in a <br>
cross-sectional view of the safety anchorage in the closed<br>
position.<br>
In the cross-sectional view shown in Fig. 3a, the metering group<br>
1 is mounted on the support base 2 and the safety anchorage is<br>
in its locked position.	<br>
In the locked position, the retaining spanner 8 is locked in the<br>
seat 13 of the support base, e.g., by way of threading and:<br>
turning the retaining spanner using, e.g., a screwdriver. In<br>
this position, the retaining spanner 8 urges the mandrel-shaped<br>
hollow body 6 in a downward direction, against the force of the<br>
spring 7, until the mandrel-shaped hollow body 6 rests on the<br>
seat 12 in the support base 2. In this position, the metering<br>
group 1 cannot be removed from the support base 2.<br><br><br>
The downward movement of the mandrel-shaped hollow portion 6 is<br>
effected by a head portion of the retaining spanner 8 resting on<br>
the shoulder 6a of the mandrel.<br>
Further, with the downward movement of the mandrel 6 the wing<br>
portion 10 of the mandrel is also moved in a downward direction<br>
and eventually moved between the pair of metal sheets of the<br>
interrupter 11, forcing the metal sheets out of electrical<br>
contact with one another, as the wing portion 10 is made of<br>
insulating material. In the position shown in Fig. 3a, the<br>
interrupter 11 is in the non-activated position, i.e. the<br>
"normal" position, when the metering group is mounted on the<br>
support base and the safety anchorage in the locked position.<br>
The lid 9 is inserted into a top portion of the mandrel-shaped<br>
hollow body, above the retaining spanner 8, to prevent access to<br>
the retaining spanner from the outside. The lid 9 can be removed<br>
from this position covering the retaining spanner only by<br>
breaking the lid, and therefore effectively provides a lid, as<br>
known in the art.<br>
Fig. 3b shows a detail of the control meter of Fig. 2 in a<br>
perspective view of the safety anchorage in the closed position.<br>
In the perspective view of Fig. 3b, the outside of the mandrel-<br>
shaped hollow body is visible, with the wing portion made of<br>
insulating material moved into the interrupter, of which the<br>
cover 11 is visible. The mandrel 6 and the cover 11 rest on a<br>
support base portion 2a of a casing of the metering group.<br>
Finally, Fig. 3b shows the lid 9 in the inserted position above<br>
the retaining spanner.<br>
In the perspective view of Fig. 2, the sealed casing of the<br>
metering group is cut out for illustration purposes. An access<br>
to the safety anchorage will only be possible through a small<br>
opening, e.g., in the top wall of the sealed casing, such as<br><br><br>
with a screw-driver to turn the retaining spanner 8, and<br>
insertion/removal of the lid 9.<br>
Fig. 4a shows a detail of the control meter of Fig. 2 in a<br>
cross-sectional view of the safety anchorage in the open<br>
position.<br>
The cross-sectional view of Fig. 4a illustrates the metering<br>
group 2 still in contact with the support base 1, however, with<br>
the safety anchorage in an unlocked position, allowing a removal<br>
of the metering group 2 from the support base 1. In the unlocked<br>
position, the retaining spanner 8 is removed from the seat 13,<br>
e.g., by unscrewing the spanner using a screwdriver. With the<br>
resilient force of the spring 7, the mandrel-shaped hollow body<br>
6 is likewise moved in an upward direction, out of the seat 12<br>
in the support base 1. Further, when the retainer spanner 8 is<br>
loosened, its rising head engages with the retainer part 15<br>
inserted into the mandrel 6 above the retainer spanner, as shown<br>
in Fig. 2, and the mandrel 6 is forced upward in addition to the.<br>
force by the spring means.<br>
When the retaining spanner 8 and the mandrel 6 are removed from<br>
their seats in the support base, the metering group 2 can be<br>
moved parallel and/or perpendicular with regard to the support<br>
base 1, for removal of the metering group.<br>
Further, with the mandrel-shaped hollow body 6 moved upwards by<br>
way of the resilient force of the spring, the wing portion 10 of<br>
the mandrel 6 is also moved in an upward direction and out of<br>
the space between the two metal sheets 11. Accordingly, the<br>
metal sheets 11 move into electric contact with one another. The<br>
position of the wing 10 must be such that an electric contact<br>
between the metal sheets 11 is established before or at the full<br>
removal of the mandrel 6 and retainer spanner 8 from their<br>
respective seats 12 and 13, so that it is assured that the<br>
electric contact is established at a point or before the<br>
metering group can actually be removed from the support base 1.<br>
The removal of the mandrel 6 and retainer spanner 8 from their<br><br><br>
respective seats 12 and 13 is supported by the spring 7 and the<br>
retainer part 15 engaging with the rising head of the retainer<br>
spanner 8.<br>
When the metal sheets 11 contact one another, the interrupter<br>
switches into the activated state and outputs an activation<br>
signal. The activation signal can, e.g., be generated by a<br>
current, which is allowed to flow between the metal sheets.<br>
This activation signal can then be output for further processing<br>
and/or can be used for opening a power switch, as detailed with<br>
regard to the embodiment of Figs, 1a and 1b.<br>
Fig. 4b shows a detail of the control meter of Fig. 2 in a<br>
perspective view of the safety anchorage in the open position.<br>
The perspective view of Fig.' 4b illustrates a portion of the<br>
support base 1 and the metering group 2, with a portion of the<br>
casing of the metering group cut out for illustration purposes. .<br>
In Fig. 4b, as in Fig. 4a, the metering group 2 is still in a<br>
position on the support base 1, however, with the safety<br>
anchorage in the unlocked position, as detailed before. The lid<br>
9 is removed from the mandrel-shaped hollow body 6, e.g., by<br>
breaking the lid, and the retaining spanner is removed from its<br>
seat in the support base. The resilient force of the spring- 7<br>
moves the mandrel-shaped hollow body 6 in an upward direction,<br>
and removes the wing portion 10 from the space between the metal<br>
sheets of the interrupter.<br>
In the following, a further embodiment of the invention will be<br>
described with regard to Figs. 5a and 5b.<br>
Figs. 5a and 5b show diagrammatical longitudinal sections of a<br>
control meter according to another embodiment of the invention<br>
in the locked position and in the unlocked position,<br>
respectively.	. .<br><br><br>
The elements described in detail above with reference to Figs. 2<br>
to 4b are also illustrated very diagrammatically in Figs. 5a and<br>
5b that show the mandrel-shaped body 6 with the respective bolt<br>
8, the spring 7 and the threaded seat 13 for anchoring the bolt<br>
8.<br>
However, differing from the previous embodiments, Figs. 5a and<br>
5b do not display the pair of metal sheets 11 forming the<br>
interrupter, but represent a variant comprised of a micro-<br>
interrupter 500 with an operation press-button, subject to the<br>
actuation by an oscillating arm 501 which is, in turn, commanded<br>
by the movement of the mandrel 6.<br>
The metering group 2 is mountable on the support base 1 by means<br>
of a bayonet-type attachment system. As is schematically shown<br>
in Figs. 5a and 5b, this system comprises, on the one hand, a<br>
pair of hook-like members 2b, 2c integral with the body 2 (for<br>
example, formed in one piece in the cast of the bottom wall 2a<br>
of the floor of the body 2), and, on the other hand, two<br>
recessed members la, lb facing each other and formed in the<br>
support base 1. <br>
Fig. 5a shows how the group 2 can be mounted on the support base<br>
1, with the members 2b, 2c being vertically spaced from the<br>
members la, lb. Fig. 5b shows, on the other hand, how the teeth<br>
2b, 2c engage in the recesses la, lb, after the group 2 has<br>
shifted from the top to the bottom on the support base 1, thus<br>
blocking the group 2 on the support base 1 against movement<br>
perpendicularly or obliquely to the supporting wall of the<br>
support base 1. The safety means according to the invention,<br>
which will be described in more detail below, is provided to<br>
prevent the group 2 from moving in the opposite direction, i.e.<br>
from the bottom to the top.<br>
The support base 1 carries a series of terminals 23 (only one of<br>
which is depicted in the drawing for the purpose of<br>
simplification) to which the ends of the conductors 20 of the<br>
main power supply line are attached; in the case of a single<br><br><br>
phase supply line, there are only two terminals, whereas in the<br>
case of a three-phase supply line there are obviously four<br>
terminals provided. As is evident from Figs. 5a and 5b, the<br>
supply terminal 23 is realized in the form of a resilient fork<br>
with which the mandrel-shaped control meter input terminal 51 of<br>
the supply line situated inside the body 2 of the control meter<br>
is apt to cooperate, engaged therewith. When the: body 2 is only<br>
resting on the support base 1 (beginning of the mounting phase<br>
as illustrated in Fig. 5b) , these terminals 23 and 51 are free,<br>
whereas the terminals 51 are engaged in the opposing terminals<br>
23 when the body 2 is caused to shift on the support base 1<br>
where it is then hooked and blocked (Fig. 5a) .<br>
As can be seen in Fig. 5a, with the safety anchorage in the<br>
locked position, the mandrel 6, which is moved downward by the<br>
retaining spanner 8, depresses the oscillating arm 501 and holds<br>
the oscillating arm 501 in the depressed position, holding the<br>
micro-switch in the non-activated condition.<br>
In contrast, as shown in Fig. 5b, when the safety anchorage is<br>
in the unlocked position, i.e. the retaining spanner 8 and<br>
mandrels 6 are removed from the support base, the oscillating<br>
arm 501 of the micro-switch can move upward, e.g., by the force<br>
of a spring 7, and the switch changes into the activated<br>
condition.<br>
Again, the transition from the non-activated condition of the<br>
switch to the activated position of the switch must take place<br>
before the retaining spanner 8 and mandrels 6 are removed from<br>
the support base.<br>
In the following, a sequence of steps necessary for mounting the<br>
 metering group on the support base will be described with regard<br>
to Figs. 5a and 5b. A reversal of these steps allows removing<br>
 the metering group from the support base.<br>
To mount the control meter in accordance with the invention, the<br>
support base 1 is initially fixed, for example, to a wall, the<br><br><br>
conductors of the energy supply line are connected to the supply<br>
terminals 23 integral with the support base 1.<br>
Thereupon, the metering group 2 is brought to rest on the<br>
support base 1, in the position as illustrated in Fig. 5b; then,<br>
taking into account the elements described above, the following<br>
steps are carried out:<br>
the group 2 is moved from the top to the bottom in the<br>
direction indicated by the arrow 550 in Fig. 5b, to achieve<br>
the interlocking of the group 2 on the support base 1,<br>
similarly to a bayonet-type coupling. One also obtains at<br>
the same time the engagement of the control meter input<br>
terminals 51 in the supply terminals 23, thus energizing the<br>
entire group 2;<br>
an appropriate device such as e.g. a screwdriver, then acts<br>
upon the bolt 8, which constitutes an anchor spanner, by<br>
exercising initially a pressing action from the top to the<br>
bottom, against the resistance of the spring 7 which is<br>
compressed.thereby. Thanks to its movement perpendicularly<br>
to the support base, the mandrel 6 forms in practice a<br>
blocking bar, its lower end engaging in the subjacent<br>
housing seat 12, thus achieving the retention of the body 2<br>
against any possible shifting movement relative to the<br>
support base 1; the insulating wing 10 simultaneously<br>
interposes itself between the pair of resilient metal sheets<br>
11 in mutual contact, in order to space them from, each other<br>
and to thus open the interrupter formed by the pair of metal<br>
sheets 11;<br>
the screw driver is then turned to screw the bolt 8 into the<br>
threaded seat 13 as far as it will go and thus to also<br>
reliably secure the interrupter according to the invention<br>
in the safety position. As mentioned above, the engagement<br>
of the mandrel 6 in the seat 12 ensures in the first place<br>
that the group 2 is mechanically blocked on the support base<br>
1; in fact, the group 2 cannot move parallel to the plane of<br><br><br>
the support base 1, resting thereupon, since it is prevented<br>
therefrom by the mandrel 6 which is engaged in the seat 12,<br>
nor can it be raised from the plane of the support base 1<br>
since this is prevented by the dents of the bayonet-type<br>
coupling.<br>
Moreover, the engagement of the insulating wing 10 between the<br>
contact sheets of the interrupter 11 keeps the latter open<br>
which, integrated in an electric safety circuit, enables supply<br>
of a "non-operative" signal to a local control unit such as a<br>
microprocessor which belongs to the general control system of<br>
the meter, as will be described in more detail below.<br>
It becomes clear from the description given above, taking as a<br>
starting point that any attempt of fraud requires initially that<br>
the entire body 2 of the control meter be removed from its<br>
support base 1, then the following steps must necessarily be<br>
taken: above all, the lid 9 must be broken and then the<br>
retaining spanner in the form of the bolt 8 must be unscrewed;<br>
the mandrel 6 can then be expelled from the seat 12 due to the'<br>
action of the spring 7, thereby releasing its lower end from its<br>
engagement in the seat 12 of the support base 1. However, in<br>
doing so, the wing 10 of insulating material also rises,<br>
departing from the metal sheets 11 of the respective interrupter<br>
and the latter closes. In the variant as shown in Figs. 5a and<br>
5b, the expulsion of the mandrel 6 under the action of the<br>
spring 7 analogously removes the mandrel 6 from the oscillating<br>
arm 501 which permits the press-button 502 to rise again,<br>
allowing thus the micro-interrupter 500 to be closed. Only then<br>
is it possible that the group 2 is shifted on the support base<br>
1, releasing it from its bayonet-type engagement, and that the<br>
group 2 is lifted to access the supply terminals 23.<br>
It is important to emphasize here that this "anti-tampering"<br>
 safety support based on closing the interrupter 11 or 11a<br>
immediately after having released the spanner 6 and hence even<br>
before the body 2 is or can be shifted relative to the support<br>
base 1, is not only efficient in the case of an attempt of fraud<br><br><br>
consisting in a removal of the measuring point which requires,<br>
as previously stated, that the supply terminals 23 be directly<br>
accessed on the support base 1, but also in the case of an<br>
attempt of fraud consisting in a manipulation of the control<br>
meter to alter the measuring constant, it must in fact be taken<br>
into consideration that this manipulation also requires that the<br>
control meter be removed from its support base 1 since the<br>
control meter is sealed and cannot be opened and. it must be<br>
forced open at the rear part so that no clear signs thereof are <br>
apparent. It must hence be followed from this that the device<br>
according to the invention efficiently prevents the fraudulent<br>
consumption of energy in any and all possible cases.<br>
According to an alternative, the arrangement of the hook-like<br>
members and the recessed members may be reversed, i.e., the<br>
metering group may be mountable on the support base by means of<br>
a bayonet-type attachment system with which the safety anchorage<br>
cooperates, the bayonet-type attachment system comprising a pair<br>
of hook-like members integral with the support base, and, two<br>
recessed members formed in the bottom wail of the body of the<br>
meter, facing the hook-like members, whereby the engagement of<br>
the hook-like teeth in the recessed members takes place due to a<br>
displacement of the body of the control meter parallel to the<br>
respective support base.<br>
Still further, in an alternative the metering group comprises a<br>
series of resilient, fork-shaped supply terminals and the<br>
support base comprises an opposing series of mandrel-shaped<br>
control meter input terminals for the subscriber line, whereby<br>
the anchoring movement of the bayonet-type attachment system<br>
also causes the mandrel-like terminals to be engaged in the<br>
opposing fork-shaped terminals.<br>
In the following a further embodiment of the invention will be<br>
described with regard to Fig. 6.<br><br><br>
Fig. 6 shows the logical functional principle of the anti-<br>
tampering system according to another embodiment of the<br>
invention.<br>
Fig. 6 illustrates the interrupter 11 and an electronic circuit<br>
14,. e.g. a latch, EEPROM, etc, for memorizing a transition of<br>
the interrupter 11 from the non-activated state to the activated<br>
state. The electronic circuit 14 is connected to one terminal of<br>
the interrupter, the other terminal of which is connected to a<br>
main power supply (not shown) and a battery 15. The battery 15<br>
supplies energy for the operation of the switch 11 and<br>
electronic circuit 14 in case of a failure or disconnection of<br>
the main power supply so that the switch 11 and the electronic<br>
circuit 14 can continue to detect and memorize the actuation<br>
state, i.e. the activated or non-activated state.<br>
The electronic circuit 14 is also connected to a local control<br>
unit 60 of the control meter and reports its actuation state or<br>
a transition of its state to the local control unit 60. The<br>
local control unit may be a microprocessor unit or the main<br>
processing unit of the meter and is connected to the main power<br>
supply.<br>
Further, the control unit 60 is connected to the electronic<br>
circuit 14 to transmit a reset signal to the electronic circuit<br>
14, for resetting the electronic circuit 14 from the activated<br>
state into the non-activated state.<br>
It can be seen in the logical principle illustrated in Fig. 6<br>
that closing the interrupter 11 causes the activation of the<br>
electronic circuit 14. It is the object of this circuit 14 to<br>
memorize the change of state of the signal corresponding to the<br>
 opening of the interrupter 11. Further, this result is<br>
immediately transmitted as a signal S16 to the local control<br>
 unit, where it is stored and maintained and processed until the<br>
reset R17 is subsequently activated.<br><br><br>
The uninterrupted operation of this part 11, 14 of the circuit<br>
is ensured by the supply of the battery 15 which is incorporated<br>
in the circuit and preferably has a service life equal to that<br>
of the meter.<br>
As stated above, the activation of the circuit 14 causes a<br>
signal S16 to be immediately transmitted via the communication<br>
line to the local control unit 60. The software of the<br>
microprocessor of this unit 60, which receives the signal S16,<br>
processes the signal just as a command to interrupt the supply<br>
of energy, and actually causes this interruption.<br>
In the following an exemplary operation of the control meter<br>
will be described.<br>
At first it is assumed that the metering group is mounted on the<br>
support base and the safety anchorage is in its locking<br>
position, the switch 11 is in the open position, e.g. the micro-<br>
switch of Fig. 1 or Fig. 5 is not activated or the wing 10 of<br>
Figs. 2-4b is inserted between the metal sheets 11a and 11b.<br>
Further, the electronic circuit 14 is considered to be in the<br>
reset, non-activated state, e.g. by way of a reset signal<br>
transmitted from the local control unit or remote control center-<br>
after the control meter has been installed and/or serviced by<br>
maintenance personnel.<br>
In this "normal" state electric energy can be drawn from the<br>
power supply line via the measuring apparatus and the subscriber<br>
line; Use of electric energy is measured and reported to the<br>
remote control center and appropriate billing statements can be<br>
generated for the subscriber.<br>
-	Now it is assumed that the safety anchorage is released from the<br>
locking position, to remove the metering group from the support<br>
-	base. Releasing the safety anchorage causes an activation of the<br>
switch, e.g. the micro-switch of Fig. 1 or Fig. 5 is activated<br>
or the wing 10 of Figs. 2-4b is removed from the space between<br>
the metal sheets 11a and 11b.<br><br>
This closing of the switch 11 applies the voltage from the<br>
battery 15 or from the main-power supply to the electronic<br>
circuit 14 and sets it into the activated state. The activation<br>
of the electronic circuit is immediately reported to the local<br>
control unit and may also be transmitted to a remote central<br>
control, which may appropriately process the activation signal.<br>
The remote central control may for example be a central control,<br>
facility or administrator responsible for managing a plurality<br>
of control meters.<br>
For example, the local control unit or remote central control<br>
may command an interruption of the power supply to the<br>
subscriber supply line by means of opening the power switch 52.<br>
In addition to reporting the signal, a time stamp of the<br>
activation may be recorded, a counter value of the measurement<br>
group and similar.<br>
According to another embodiment, the circuit arrangement of Fig.<br>
6 is further suited to avoid a report of spurious signals as<br>
tampering signals from the local control unit to the remote<br>
control center, as outlined in the following.<br>
During normal operation, when a main power supply to the control<br>
meter is switched on and supplies electric energy to its<br>
components, upon removing the metering unit from the meter base,<br>
the switch 11 is closed and correspondingly an activation signal<br>
is supplied and held in the electronic circuit 14 and the<br>
activation signal is reported as signal S16 to the local control<br>
unit 60. Upon receiving the activation signal S16 the local<br>
control unit 60 generates a reset signal R17 to reset the<br>
electronic circuit 14. This reset signal may be transmitted<br>
 immediately upon receiving the activation signal S16 or delayed<br>
by a predetermined amount of time, such as 200 ms. The reset<br>
 signal 17 will reset the electronic circuit 14 into the non-<br>
activated state, however, as the switch 11 will be still closed<br>
due to the removal of the meter, the electronic circuit 14 will<br><br><br>
be activated again and the activation signal S16 will be again<br>
transmitted to the local control unit 60.<br>
This cycle of transmitting the activation signal S16 and<br>
resetting the electronic circuit 14 via the reset signal R17<br>
will therefore be repeated a plurality of times with an internal<br>
counter of the local control unit 60 counting the set/reset<br>
operations and, if a certain number of reset operations is.<br>
reached, the tamper signal is generated. For example, a sequence<br>
of five to twenty five reset operations could be used as a limit<br>
value for the counter, and if this limit value is exceeded, the<br>
tamper signal is generated. However, it is noted that any other<br>
number of set and reset operations could be used as a limit,<br>
upon which the tamper signal is generated.<br>
Accordingly, the circuit allows to detect a prolonged closing of<br>
the switch 11, e.g. for more than one or five seconds,<br>
corresponding to the time required for the number of reset<br>
operations selected as limit before generating the tamper<br>
signal. Only if the switch 11 remains closed for more than this<br>
time frame, the tamper signal will be generated. Of course, this<br>
time frame will be selected such that a manipulation of the<br>
control meter within the time limit is not possible.<br>
In the following a case will be considered where a spurious<br>
signal activates the electronic circuit 14. A spurious signal<br>
could for example be generated by electromagnetic induction or<br>
any other event different from opening the switch 11 that<br>
activates the electronic circuit 14. This spurious signal is<br>
considered to be present only for a brief amount of time, e.g. a<br>
few milliseconds or similar.<br>
 Occurrence of the spurious signal will activate the electronic<br>
circuit 14 and the activation signal S16 will be transmitted to<br>
 the local control unit 60. Upon receiving the activation signal<br>
S16, the local control unit 60 will transmit a reset signal R17<br>
to the electronic circuit 14, to reset the electronic circuit<br>
14. As the spurious signal only has a short duration, at the<br><br><br>
time of the reset operation the spurious signal may have<br>
vanished or vanishes after very few reset operations of the<br>
electronic circuit 14 and thus after one or a few reset<br>
operations the electronic circuit 14 will again remain in the<br>
non-activated state.<br>
Erroneous generation of the tamper signal therefore is avoided,<br>
as long as the spurious signal does not exceed the time limit or<br>
number of reset operations used as a limit value.<br>
According to another embodiment the local control unit 60 is<br>
acapted to perform the sequence of reset operations, i.e. to<br>
transmit the reset signal R17 to the electronic circuit 14, only<br>
in case the main power supply is switched on without an<br>
interruption. This prevents an unauthorised person fron<br>
deliberately switching off the main power supply to the meter,<br>
in an attempt to avoid detection of closing the switch 11 when<br>
removing the metering unit from the base.<br>
This also prevents an unauthorized person from removing the<br>
meter unit from the support base during a power outage, e.g.<br>
when for maintenance reasons the electric network is down.<br>
In this case it is considered that the main power supply is<br>
switched off and thereafter the metering unit is removed from<br>
the base. As the switch 11 is connected to the battery 15,<br>
removing the metering unit from the base auring the absence of<br>
the main power supply, will also activate the electronic circuit<br>
14, and, since the electronic circuit 14 is also connected to<br>
the battery 15, the electronic circuit 14 will hold its<br>
activated state.<br>
Moreover, after again switching on the main power supply, the<br>
local control unit 60, detecting the power outage, refrains from<br>
transmitting the reset signal R17 to the electronic circuit 14,<br>
in order to avoid resetting the electronic circuit 14, for<br>
example if the switch 11 is again open before turning again on<br>
the main power supply.<br><br><br>
In this case the local control unit 60 will only operate to<br>
detect the activation signal S16 from the electronic circuit 14<br>
and directly report the tampering signal to the remote central<br>
control.<br>
Further, after detecting the end of the power outage, the<br>
control meter may resume the operations to suppress spurious<br>
signals, i.e. the sequence of reset operations, if upon the end<br>
of the power outage the activation signal S16 was not detected.<br>
According to another embodiment, in order to further avoid; the<br>
unintended transmittal of a tampering signal due to spurious<br>
signals occurring during a short failure of the main power;<br>
supply, the local control unit 60 is adapted to only refrain<br>
from transmitting the reset signal R17 in the presence of an<br>
absence of the main power supply of more a certain amount of<br>
time, for example one or five seconds, i.e., a time limit too<br>
short for removing the metering unit from the base, manipulating<br>
the metering unit and reapplying the metering unit to the base.<br>
Thus, occurrence of spurious signals activating the electronic<br>
circuit 14 during the absence of the main power supply will not<br>
lead to the transmission of a tampering signal to the remote<br>
central control., thus avoiding erroneous reports of tampering<br>
attempts during short absence of the main power supply.<br>
In the following a further embodiment of the invention will be<br>
described with regard to Fig. 7.<br>
Fig. 7 shows a flow diagram of operations carried out at the<br>
local control unit of the control meter to detect tampering with<br>
the control meter during a power-on and/or power-off situation,<br>
 for example by the circuit arrangement shown in Fig. 6.<br>
 In a first operation 7 01 the local control unit determines<br>
whether a power-off condition was present. A power-off condition<br>
could for example be the failure or deliberate turnoff of a main<br>
power supply or could be any other interruption of the power<br><br><br>
supply to the local control unit. A power-off	condition can for<br>
example be detected by the local control unit	by checking a<br>
power-on flag stored in a memory of the local	control unit, the<br>
power-on flag being maintained during a power	on condition and<br>
being cleared upon a power failure.<br>
If in operation 701 it is determined that a power-off condition<br>
did not occur, i.e., that the power supply to the local control<br>
unit was continuously switched on, in an operation 701a a reset<br>
counter is cleared and in an operation 702 it is determined<br>
whether an activation signal is received from an electronic<br>
circuit such as the electronic circuit 14 of Fig. 6, the<br>
electronic circuit latching the activation signal upon removal<br>
of the metering unit from the base, i.e., when closing the<br>
switch 11 of Fig. 6.<br>
If in operation 7 02 the presence of the activation signal is<br>
detected, in an operation 7 03 the local control unit resets the<br>
electronic circuit 14. The reset operation can be carried out<br>
via the signal R17 shown in Fig. 6.<br>
Thereafter, in an operation 704 the reset counter counting the<br>
number of times of resetting the electronic circuit is<br>
incremented. Preferably, before operations start, this counter<br>
was appropriately cleared. For example, the reset counter could<br>
be cleared before or after operation 701.<br>
Thereafter, in an operation 705 it is determined whether the<br>
reset counter exceeds a reset limit, such as the reset limit<br>
described with regard to Fig. 6. The reset limit is preferably<br>
selected such that the time duration of the reset operations<br>
until the reset limit is exceeded is shorter than a time period<br>
 required for removing and manipulating the metering unit. For<br>
example, if such a time limit is considered to be one second and<br>
if a reset cycle of the electronic circuit has a duration of<br>
100ms, then the reset limit would appropriately be set to ten,<br>
as after ten reset operations the one second time limit is<br><br><br>
reached. However, this is an example only and any other reset<br>
limit could be used.<br>
If it is determined in operation 705 that the reset counter<br>
exceeds the reset limit, a tamper signal is generated,<br>
indicating that the metering unit was removed from the meter<br>
base for more than the selected limit. The tamper signal can be<br>
stored in a permanent memory of the local control unit and<br>
alternatively thereto or in addition thereto can be transmitted<br>
to a remote central control, to inform an operator or power<br>
supply company regarding the removal of the metering unit.<br>
Moreover, based on the tamper signal, the local control unit or<br>
remote central control may switch off the subscriber line, as<br>
outlined before.<br>
If in operation 7 05 it was determined that the reset counter did<br>
not exceed the reset limit, the flow returns to operation 702,<br>
where it is determined whether the electronic circuit is again<br>
set, i.e. whether the activation signal is again present at the<br>
electronic circuit. The activation signal will be present, if<br>
the metering unit has been removed from the metering base, e.g.,<br>
if the switch 11 remains closed, as in this case the electronic<br>
circuit will again be activated. However, if the activation of<br>
the electronic circuit was in connection with a spurious event,<br>
such as electric magnetic discharges, radio frequency<br>
interferences and similar, the electronic circuit will not be<br>
again activated, thus remaining in a non-activated state. If the<br>
activation signal is not present in operation 702, the flow<br>
returns to operation 701.<br>
If in operation 701 it was determined that a power-off condition<br>
occurred, and the power supply is now again available, in an<br>
 operation 707 a real time clock is read. The real time clock is<br>
supplied by a battery, such as the battery 15 of Fig. 6, and<br>
 measures the duration of a power outage at the local control<br>
unit.<br><br><br>
In order to measure the time duration of the power outage, at<br>
the starting of the power off, a present RTC count could be<br>
frozen or memorized in a nonvolatile memory register. Provided<br>
that the RTC still continues with normal counting operations,<br>
e.g. by the battery backup, also during the power outage, a<br>
reading of the RTC value upon turning on the main power supply<br>
and a comparison with the previously memorized value provides a<br>
simple measurement of the outage duration.<br>
Thereafter, in an operation 708 it is determined whether the<br>
duration of the power-off condition, i.e. the time read from the<br>
real time clock, exceeds a power-out limit. The power-out limit<br>
preferably is set to a time limit shorter than a time limit<br>
required for removing and manipulating the metering unit. For<br>
example, the power-off time limit could be set to one second,<br>
corresponding to the counter reset limit checked in operation<br>
705. However, it is noted that any other power-off limit could<br>
be selected, such as five seconds, ten seconds and similar.<br>
If it is determined in operation 708 that the power-off limit is<br>
exceeded, in an operation 709 it is determined whether the<br>
activation signal from the electronic circuit is present. The<br>
activation signal will be present, for example if during the<br>
power-out condition the metering unit was removed from the<br>
metering base and the electronic circuit was activated during<br>
the power-off condition.<br>
If in operation 709 the activation signal is present, the flow<br>
continues with operation 706 for generating, storing and/or<br>
transmitting the tamper signal, etc., as noted before.<br>
If in operation 709 the activation signal is not present, i.e.,<br>
 the electronic circuit was not activated during the power<br>
outage, the flow continues with operation 701.<br>
Further, if in operation 708 the power-off duration did not<br>
exceed the power-off time limit, the flow of operations<br>
continues with operation 7 01a.<br><br><br>
Accordingly, the operations outlined with regard to Fig. 7 allow<br>
an efficient determination of a removal of the metering unit<br>
from the metering base, while avoiding an erroneous detection of<br>
the removal of the metering unit due to spurious signals.<br>
Further, the operations outlined in Fig. 7 allow a determination<br>
of a removal of the metering unit also during a power-out<br>
condition.<br>
According to an alternative, the real time clock read in<br>
operation 707, in an alternative to being started upon the begin<br>
of a power-out condition, could be initialized upon detecting an<br>
activation of the electronic circuit during a power-out<br>
condition.<br>
Further, it is noted that some of the operations shown in Fig. 7<br>
are optional, and may be omitted in alternative embodiments. For<br>
example, the operations in connection with determining a power-<br>
off condition, i.e. operations 701, 707, 708 and 709 may be<br>
omitted.<br>
The advantages of the present invention can be briefly<br>
summarized as follows: The following conditions are activated<br>
after the alert situation has been discovered:<br>
activation of an adequate anti-tampering alert flag<br>
according to the state of the meter, which flag can be<br>
"read" without delay by the local control unit or remote<br>
central control;<br>
sending out a command to the remotely operable device for<br>
opening a power switch in order to interrupt (or suspend)<br>
the supply of energy to the customer;<br>
inhibition of the manual closure of the power until a<br>
specific command is received from the remote central control<br>
or remote central server after confirmation of intervention<br>
by the control operator;<br><br>
setting of a visual flag for supervisor personnel or<br>
providing an alert icon on the local display, the icon being<br>
also a signal for the registered subscriber of the control<br>
meter in the event that the actuation should be due to<br>
unknown third parties;<br>
local visualizing, also physically, of the position taken up<br>
by the mandrel 6 expelled from the spring 7 and break of the<br>
iid 9.<br>
It is at any rate understood that the invention is not limited<br>
to the specific disposition as explained above which only<br>
constitutes an example embodiment of the invention, but that<br>
various variants are possible, all of which lie within the<br>
abilities of a person skilled in the art, without exceeding the<br>
scope of protection of the invention as defined by the<br>
subsequent claims. It should particularly be borne in mind that<br>
in the illustrated embodiment, the electrical safety signal is<br>
activated on closing the interrupter 11 or 1.1a, but a<br>
modification of the mechanical system and of the electric<br>
circuit to the effect that the same result is achieved by means<br>
of a safety signal generated by opening the interrupter also<br>
lies within the capabilities of the skilled person in an obvious<br>
manner.<br>
Further, while the above embodiments relate to the field of the<br>
distribution of electrical energy to a plurality of subscribers<br>
distributed within a territory, the invention is equally<br>
applicable in more general terms to other services such as, for<br>
example, the distribution of water, gas or to tele-heating. In<br>
this case metering components of the control meter will be<br>
 appropriately replaced. For example, a valve for gas or water<br>
distribution may replace the power switch.<br><br>
