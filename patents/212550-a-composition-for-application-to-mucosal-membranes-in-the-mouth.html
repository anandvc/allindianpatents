				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention pertains to compositions having improved delivery of pharmaceutical active ingredients. These compositions comprise pharmaceutical actives in an anhydrous, hydrophilic solvent. These compositions may take the form of liquid elixirs placed into the mouth and eventually swallowed, or can be delivered via liquid-filled lozenges and gums, metered liquid dosing devices, atomizers and liquid-releasing, edible capsules. Such compositions are particularly useful for treating symptoms associated with respiratory illnesses.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Routes for delivering pharmaceutical actives include delivering actives by intranasal, pulmonary, buccal, sublingual, transdermal. and rectal administration.   These routes tend to be used for avoiding first-pass metabolism of drugs that are swallowed.   "First past metabolism" refers to the arrangement and order of placement of the metabolizing enzymes within the body of a human, with respect to the path followed by substances that enter the gastrointestinal tract by swallowing, and are absorbed into the general blood circulation.   Items swallowed by humans, including food, dnnk, and medicines, enter the stomach and from there flow into the intestine. Many of the chemicals associated with the food, drink, or medicine pass through the mucosal membranes in the gastrointestinal tract and into the blood in the mesenteric veins draining from the intestine.   The blood flow from the mesentenc veins passes into the liver.   Metabolizing enzymes in the mucosal membranes of the intestine and in the liver can chemically alter the nature of substances passing from the intestine, through the liver, and into the common blood circulation of the body. Since all swallowed medicines are subject to the metabolizing capacity of the intestinal mucosal membranes and the liver before entering the general blood circulation of the body, frequently only a small fraction of those substances go unmetabolized, and reach the general blood circulation<br>
Avoiding first pass metabolism can increase the bioavailability, or blood concentrations of the administered  compound.     Metabolic  formation  of metabolites  of the administered<br>
compound, however, can at the same time decrease.   Where formation of metabolites from the first pass metabolism is desirable, avoiding the first pass metabolism is not preferred since it logically leads to lower amounts of the  metabolite  in the  blood.     Furthermore,  the blood concentrations of the active substance can increase, leading to potential toxicity or side effects attributable to the active per se.   Reducing the amount of active in the dose for avoiding toxiciry. concomitantly decreases the circulating blood levels of the active metabolite.  This results in loss of therapeutic affect and ultimately, benefit to the patient.  In order to provide a medication that is effective and avoids unwanted side effects, the composition and its means of delivery must be modified.<br>
Respiratory illnesses covers a broad range of ailments, including viral infections and allergic reaction to inhaled allergens. Viral infections in the upper respiratory tract of humans leads to illness usually referred to as colds, or influenza. Such an illness is quite common in the general population and can be the cause of significant discomfort and suffering. Allergen inhalation also negatively impacts a fair number in the population at the same or even at a greater degree than those having a viral infection.<br>
There are no generally regarded .effective and convenient methods for preventing viral infections or allergies.   In the case of viral infections, the body's natural defense mechanisms fight the infection for a period of time normally ranging from 3 days to 2 weeks.  This being the case, the most commonly employed medicines treat the uncomfortable, problematic symptoms of these respiratory ailments.    These symptoms  include stuffy and runny noses, soreness and inflammation in the nose and throat, fits of coughing, general aches in the body, fever, and headache.   Of these symptoms, coughing in uncontrollable fits is considered by many to be the most problematic and uncomfortable. Coughing disrupts normal respiration, leading to increased headache and sore throat as well as loss of sleep to the sufferer and others living with the sufferer The compositions used to treat the above mentioned symptoms generally fall into one of the   following   pharmacological   classifications:   antihistamines;   decongestants;   antitussives; expectorants;    mucolytics;    analgesics,    antipyretic    and   anti-inflammatory   agents.       The compositions are manufactured in a number of product forms, the most common being liquid syrups and elixirs for swallowing, mouth drops and lozenges as well as inhalants and topical creams or lotions that release volatile agents that are inhaled through the nose into respiratory tract.  The compositions are typically swallowed immediately, or slowly dissolved in the mouth. They typically contain actives such as guaifenesin, that aids the body in the removal of excess respiratory mucus or phlegm, diphenhydramine,  that  lessens the negative effects  including coughing and other symptoms due to histamine produced in the body in response to the viral infection, and dextromethorphan, that acts within the part of the human brain controlling the<br>
coughing reflex.   Among these actives, Dextromethorphan is the most commonly used active in the world for relief of cough.<br>
Dextromethorphan, by virtue of it's physicochemical. absorption, and bioavailability properties, is a very good candidate for increasing bioavailability via methods of administration other than swallowing. For example it has been reported in patents and pharmaceutical literature that substantial increases in bioavailability can be achieved using intranasal formulations; see H. Char et al. Nasal. ..Delivery of 14-C Dextromethorphan in Rats. Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences 81:750, 1992.<br>
What has not been realized until now is that after careful and diligent research into pharmaceutic, therapeutic, and side effect properties of active compounds, compositions can be made to positively improve the therapeutic effect without increased side effects or toxicity.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object, therefore, of the present invention is to provide improved compositions for treating the symptoms associated with respiratory  ailments,  particularly minimizing fits of coughing.    The compositions are solutions of pharmaceutical  actives in  small  volumes of anhydrous, hydrophilic  liquids providing rapid delivery of pharmaceutical  actives including antitussives:      antihistamines     (including     non-sedating     antihistamines);      decongestants; expectorants;   mucolytics;   analgesic,   antipyretic   and   anti-inflammatory   agents   and   local anesthetics for treating the symptoms of respiratory illnesses.   The compositions can be dosed using a variety of product forms and. or package delivery options.    The compositions of the present invention provide improved activity while minimizing potential  side effects of the pharmaceutical active.   It is also an objective of the subject invention to provide methods for achieving rapid transmucosal delivery of the aforementioned compositions.<br>

METHOD OF USE<br>
In terms of the methods of delivery of the active, it is generally accepted that oral mucosal delivery inside the mouth must be targeted to the sub-lingual region in order to achieve a very rapid therapeutic effect; see D. Hams and J.R. Robinson, Drug Delivery via the Mucus Membranes of the Oral Cavity. Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences 81: 1, 1992.   Such dosage forms are designed to be placed under the tongue, on the floor of the mouth, and held there for some extended time.  The inventors have found, however, that a large increase in bioavailabiliry with very rapid absorption can be achieved when the subject compositions are placed against any of the mucosal membranes of the mouth, even onto the tongue and swallowed.   The form of the invention is a liquid elixir solution. It is intended to be applied to any of the mucosal membranes within the mouth.   This can be achieved using a medicine dropper that is calibrated to indicate the  proper  amount  to be  administered,  and squirting  the  elixir onto  the  tongue  prior  to swallowing.   The elixir can be atomized into mouth and throat and then swallowed.   It can be encapsulated into some sort of shell which makes it portable and convenient to transport and administer without having to measure the quantity of liquid elixir.   Examples of encapsulation shells include hard candies as are used for lozenges, chewing gums, gelatin, or non-gelatin (e.g. starch-based) shells. The elixir may be packaged into a small, disposable vial which can readily be opened and squirted into the mouth, the entire vial containing exactly one therapeutic dose. Typical dosage forms of the composition of the present invention contain no more than about 3 ml., preferable from about 0.2 ml. to about 3ml..<br>
One preferred form is to encapsulate the liquid into a shell of hard candy or gelatin. The shell containing substances to pretreat the mucosa and thereby enhance the absorption of the active from the liquid center. The pretreatment occurs by sucking or chewing the shell matenal, and the advantage is gamed by separating in time the treatment of the mucosa, which occurs first, followed by the presentation of the active to be absorbed. Examples of substances for pretreatment of the mucosal membranes are membrane penetration enhancers that are commonly known in the art, examples including menthol, peppermint oil, surfactants such as polysorbate 80 or poloxamer. Another example of a mucosal membrane pretreatment are buffers as listed above, which would precondition salivary micro environment pH in the range of 8 to 10.<br><br>
