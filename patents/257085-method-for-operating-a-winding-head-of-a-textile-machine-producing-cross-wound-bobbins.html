3.   PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be  performed : -<br><br>
The invention relates to a method for operating a winding head of a textile machine producing cross-wound bobbins according to the preamble of claim 1.<br>
Feed bobbins, for example spinning cops produced on ring spinning machines, which contain relatively small yarn volumes, are rewound to form large-volume cross-wound bobbins on the winding heads of textile machines producing cross-wound bobbins, in particular of automatic cross-winding machines. During the rewinding process, the yarn is also monitored for yarn defects, yarn defects being cut out and replaced by splices which are virtually identical to the yarn. During the rewinding process, in which the yarn is drawn off overhead from the spinning cops with the formation of a so-called thread balloon, the yarn is subject to thread tensile forces, which ultimately limit the take-off speed of the thread and therefore the winding speed of the automatic cross-winding machines. These thread tensile forces can reach very different orders of magnitude, in other words, the thread tensile force can grow to a multiple of the starting thread tensile force if no effective counter measures are taken and this considerably increases the risk of thread breaks. As thread breaks not only impair the quality of the cross-wound bobbin, but also reduce the efficiency of the relevant automatic cross-winding machines, attempts have been made for a long time to develop methods and devices, by means of which the run-off behaviour of the spinning cops can be improved during the rewinding process and thus the thread take-off speed can be increased.<br>
In conjunction with automatic cross-winding machines of this type, it has therefore been known for a long time to arrange devices in the region of the winding heads, which facilitate or improve the take off of the thread from the spinning cops. Devices are described in numerous patents, which are generally arranged above a spinning cop positioned in the winding position and which assist the release of the thread from the spinning cop during the rewinding process. In other words, devices have been known for many years, which are also to ensure that the thread tension is maintained at a level which is not damaging to the thread during the rewinding process.<br><br><br>
A device of this type, also known as a thread take off accelerator, is described, for example, in DE 44 18 312 Al. This thread take off accelerator has a guide face for the thread, which has the shape of a truncated cone surface, wherein the large diameter faces the spinning cop. It is to be achieved by a configuration of this type of a thread take off accelerator that the thread balloon which forms, when the thread is drawn off overhead from the spinning cop, is not destroyed or suppressed, but is only formed optimally.<br>
Furthermore, textile machines producing cross-wound bobbins, which are equipped in each case in the region of their winding heads with special auxiliary unwinding devices, which can be tracked according to the unwinding process, to optimise the thread take off, are furthermore described, for example, in DE 44 06 076 Al, DE 42 21 559 Al or DE 10 2005 036 704 published subsequently.<br>
The auxiliary unwinding devices according to DE 44 06 076 Al consist, for example, of a plurality of tubular elements which can be pushed into one another.<br>
A lower element which can be lowered over the spinning cop is guided here by means of a drive mechanism in a height-adjustable manner on a central element, which is in turn fixed via a clamping means to a further upper element, which is in turn arranged stationarily on a fitting plate of the winding head. The lower tubular element, which is configured in a cone-like manner in the region of its lower edge can be lowered in a defined manner during the rewinding process by means of an associated drive over the spinning cop in such a way that the cone is always positioned in the region of the so-called winding cone of the spinning cop. The central element, which, on the input side, has a narrow location, remains, during the entire rewinding process, in its installation position adjusted at the beginning of a new batch. The narrow location arranged at the input side of the central element and which is positioned closely above the tube tip of the spinning cop to be rewound leads to the fact that the multiple thread balloon being adjusted during the winding process is divided into a lower and an upper partial balloon.<br><br><br>
A comparable auxiliary unwinding device is also described in DE 42 21 559.<br>
This known auxiliary unwinding device has a first tube body which is height-adjustable in a defined manner by means of a drive mechanism and can be lowered over the spinning cop, on which tube body a second tube body which is also height-adjustable is supported. This second tube body is guided on a sliding rod between two stops by means of which the maximum adjustment range of the second tube body which, viewed in the thread running direction, has a narrow location on the output side, is limited. This narrow location predetermines the length of the section, on which multiple thread balloons form during the thread take off.<br>
The auxiliary unwinding mechanism according to the subsequently published DE 10 2005 036 704 has a vertically displaceably mounted balloon limiter, a tubular thread guide mechanism with a thread guide eyelet arranged on the input side and an adapter, to which a gripper tube which can be subjected to a reduced pressure, can be connected. The thread guide mechanism and therefore the thread guide eyelet are arranged stationarily. The balloon limiter is displaceable in a defined manner in the vertical direction via a drive in such a way that the balloon limiter can be tracked during the winding process, following the unwinding progress of the spinning cop and the lower edge of the balloon limiter can always be positioned approximately at the level of the winding cone of the spinning cop.<br>
By using the above-described auxiliary unwinding mechanisms, the winding speeds of these textile machines could be slightly increased, but the known auxiliary unwinding mechanisms are still clearly capable of improvement, however, in particular with regard to the positioning of their functional elements at the beginning and during the rewinding process.<br>
Proceeding from auxiliary unwinding devices of the type described above, the invention is based on the object of developing a method, which allows an auxiliary unwinding mechanism known per se to be used optimally, in other words allows the<br><br><br>
functional parts of an auxiliary unwinding mechanism to be positioned in such a way that a thread tension is adjusted when unwinding a spinning cop that allows the winding speed to be clearly increased at the winding heads of automatic cross-winding machines of this type without the risk, in this case, of thread breaks increasingly occurring.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention by a method as described in claim 1.<br>
Advantageous configurations of the invention are the subject of the sub-claims.<br>
The method according to the invention has the advantage, in particular, that optimal adjustments with regard to the positioning of the functional elements of the auxiliary unwinding mechanism are immediately implemented at the relevant winding head at each batch start or at each batch change, with the result that during the entire winding process, even at very high winding speeds, a so-called "single thread balloon" is reliably adjusted.<br>
The functional elements of the auxiliary unwinding mechanism are in each case positioned for this purpose in a predeterminable start position or a defined initial position. In other words, the thread guide mechanisms is brought into a start position, in which the lower edge of the thread guide mechanism has a certain axial spacing Dl, which is dependent on at least one of the existing yarn parameters, from the lower edge of the tube of a spinning cop positioned in an unwinding position. Furthermore, the balloon limiter is positioned with regard to the winding cone of the spinning cop in a defined initial position, in which a radial spacing D2 is provided between the lower edge of the inner face of the balloon limiter and the surface of the winding cone, the radial spacing D2 also being dependent upon at least one of the existing yarn diameters.<br><br><br>
By means of a targeted positioning of this type of the functional elements of the auxiliary unwinding mechanism, it is ensured that both a perfect transfer of the thread coming from the spinning cop to the auxiliary unwinding device subjected to a reduced pressure can take place, and it is also ensured that the thread can be drawn off undisturbed from the spinning cop from the beginning of the rewinding process, with the formation of a single thread balloon.<br>
As described in claim 2, it is provided, in an advantageous embodiment, that various relevant yarn parameters are taken into account in the positioning of the thread guide mechanism in the start position and/or in the positioning of the balloon limiter in the initial position.<br>
These relevant yarn parameters may be, for example, the fineness of the yarn, the yarn elasticity, the length of the spinning cop tube, the winding tension and the winding speed.<br>
The optimal start or initial positions for the thread guide limiters or the balloon limiter are preferably determined or verified, in this case, as described in claim 3, by means of a so-called pilot spindle. A pilot spindle of this type known per se is a simple and proven possibility for quickly and reliably setting up optimum adjustment data for the functional elements of the auxiliary unwinding device or checking existing adjustment data.<br>
It is provided in an advantageous configuration that the initial data for adjusting the pilot spindle are taken from a database, in which corresponding expert knowledge is stored (claim 4). The expert knowledge stored in the database in this case contains, for example, the knowledge about the influence of various spacings Dl or D2 on the unwinding behaviour of spinning cops taking into account various yarn parameters. In other words, by means of the data stored in the database, the pilot spindle can firstly be taken into operation without any problems with a basic adjustment. With the aid of winding tests, the selected adjustment data of the pilot spindle can then be<br><br><br>
checked and optionally optimised. In practice, this means that when there is a change of batch, the regular winding process of a new yarn batch is already started with the optimal adjustment data of the auxiliary winding mechanism.<br>
As shown in claims 5, 6 and 7, during the positioning of the functional elements of the auxiliary winding device in the start positions or initial position, some measurements for certain spacings should not be fallen below. It has proven to be, for example, if the axial spacing Dl of the lower edge of the thread guide mechanism from the lower edge of the tube is selected in such a way that it does not fall below the length of the tube of the spinning cop positioned in the spinning position + 30 mm (claim 5).<br>
Moreover, the lower edge of the inner face of the balloon limiter in the initial position should have at least a radial spacing D2 from the surface of the winding cone of the spinning cop of 3 mm (claim 6) or, as shown in claim 7, should not fall below 10 times the yarn diameter of the yarn located on the spinning cop.<br>
As described in claims 8 and 9, the positioning of the thread guide mechanism in the start position and of the balloon limiter in the initial position can take place both manually and automatically. In other words, the functional elements of the auxiliary unwinding mechanism are either manually positioned by the operating personnel, according to the adjustment data determined by the pilot spindle, or an adjustment mechanism, which, for example, is activated by a control mechanism specific to the winding head according to the adjustment data determined, ensures automatically before each new batch start that the thread guide mechanism and the balloon limiter are positioned in the optimum start or initial position.<br>
In order to also be able to permanently maintain optimal unwinding conditions during the winding operation, in other words, to ensure the formation of a single thread balloon during the thread take off, during the winding process, as described in claim 10, the position of the balloon limiter in accordance with the position of the<br><br><br>
winding cone of the spinning cop is continuously tracked until the balloon limiter reaches an end position. In other words, the radial spacing D2 of the inner edge of the balloon limiter and the surface of the winding cone of the spinning cop remains virtually constant until the end position of the balloon limiter is reached.<br>
As described in claim 11, it is also provided in an advantageous configuration of the invention that a certain spacing D3 is maintained between the upper edge of the tube of the spinning cop and the lower edge of the thread guide mechanism. The spacing D3 is produced here as a function of the signals of a thread tensile force sensor, which scans the winding tension at the running thread during the winding process.<br>
As indicated in claim 12, the spacing D3 is increased when the thread tension measured during the winding process, despite a maximally closed thread tensioner, becomes too low. The spacing D3 can be increased, in this case, until the axial spacing Dl of the thread guide mechanism from the lower edge of the tube of the spinning cop is a maximum of 10 times the length of the tube (claim 13).<br>
Accordingly, as shown in claim 14, the spacing D3 is reduced if the measured thread tension becomes too high despite a maximally opened thread tensioner during the winding process.<br>
According to claim 15, the spacing D3 can be reduced to a maximum of 2 mm or to 4 times the yarn diameter of the yarn located on the spinning cop.<br>
As described in claim 16, it is also provided in an advantageous embodiment that the continuous tracking of the spacings D2 and/or D3 during the winding process preferably takes place with the aid of corresponding curves, which, for example, are stored in a memory of a control device specific to the winding machine.<br>
Further details of the invention are described below with the aid of an embodiment shown in the drawings, in which:<br><br><br>
Fig. 1 shows a side view of a winding head of a textile machine producing cross-wound bobbins with an auxiliary unwinding device, which is operated in accordance with the method according to the invention,<br>
Fig. 2 shows a perspective view of the auxiliary unwinding device which can be operated according to the invention and is shown schematically in Fig. 1,<br>
Fig. 3 shows the detail III according to Fig. 1,<br>
Fig. 4 shows the read feed region of an auxiliary unwinding device according to the invention, to a larger scale.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a schematic side view of a textile machine producing cross-wound bobbins, in the embodiment, a so-called automatic cross-winding machine 1. Automatic cross-winding machines 1 of this type have, between their end frames (not shown), a plurality of similar workstations or winding heads 2, on which, as known, and therefore not explained in more detail, the spinning cops 9 produced on a ring spinning machine (not shown) and having only relatively little yarn material are rewound to form large-volume cross-wound bobbins 11. The cross-wound bobbins 11 are then transferred, for example by means of a cross-wound bobbin changer, to a cross-wound bobbin transporting mechanism 21 along the machine and transported to a bobbin loading station (not shown) or the like arranged at the end of the machine.<br>
Such automatic cross-winding machines 1 also have, as indicated in Fig. 1, a logistics mechanism in the form of a bobbin and tube transporting system 3, in which, fixed on transport plates 8 in a vertical orientation, spinning cops 9 or empty tubes 34 circulate.<br>
Of this bobbin and tube transporting system 3, only the bobbin supply section 4, the reciprocally drivable storage section 5, one of the transverse transporting sections 6<br><br><br>
leading to the winding heads 2 and the tube return section 7 are shown in Fig. 1. As indicated, the supplied spinning cops 9 are, in this case, positioned and rewound in an unwinding position 10, which is located in the region of the transverse transporting sections 6 at the winding heads 2.<br>
The individual winding heads 2, for this purpose, as known and therefore only indicated, have various thread treatment and handling mechanisms, which not only ensure that the spinning cops 9 can be rewound to form large-volume cross-wound bobbins 11, but which also ensure that the thread is monitored during the rewinding process for thread defects and detected thread defects are cleared out.<br>
The winding heads 2, for example, in each case have a winding device 24 with a creel 18 movably mounted via a pivot axle 19, a bobbin drive mechanism 26 and a thread traversing mechanism 28. In the embodiment shown in Fig. 1, the cross-wound bobbin 11 is located during the winding process, for example, with its surface on a drive drum 26, which can be acted upon by a single motor, and is entrained thereby via frictional engagement. The traversing of the thread when running onto the cross-wound bobbin 11, takes place by means of a thread traversing mechanism 28, which in the present embodiment has a finger thread guide 29.<br>
Such thread traversing mechanisms are known and described, for example, in DE<br>
198 58 548 Al.<br>
Winding heads 2 of this type also have a thread connection mechanism 13, preferably a pneumatically operating splicing mechanism, a suction tube 12 which can be acted upon by reduced pressure and a gripper tube 25 which can also be acted upon by reduced pressure. The suction tube 12 and the gripper tube 25 are connected in this case to a reduced pressure cross-beam 32 specific to the machine, which cross-beam is in turn connected to a reduced pressure source 33.<br><br><br>
Such workstations 2 generally also have a lower thread sensor 22, a thread tensioner 14, a thread clearer 15 with a thread cutting mechanism 17, a thread tensile force sensor 20 and a waxing mechanism 16 and a so-called winding head computer 60, which activates the various functional elements.<br>
Furthermore, the workstations 2 are equipped with an auxiliary unwinding device 23, which is used for the pneumatic transfer of a so-called lower thread lying ready at the spinning cop 9 to a gripper tube 25 which is acted upon by reduced pressure, and also ensures during the winding process that the thread balloon, which is produced when the thread runs off the spinning cop 9, is positively influenced in the sense of a reduction of the thread tension.<br>
This auxiliary unwinding mechanism 23 consists, as also indicated in Fig. 2 in a perspective view, substantially of a vertically displaceably mounted balloon limiter 27 and a tubular thread guide mechanism 38. In other words, the balloon limiter 27 can be adjusted in a defined manner in the vertical direction R by a drive 30 such that the balloon limiter 27, during the winding process, can be moved downwardly following the unwinding progress of the spinning cop 9. The lower edge of the balloon limiter 27 is preferably constantly arranged, in this case, approximately at the level of the winding cone 52 of the spinning cop 9 positioned in the unwinding position 10.<br>
As indicated in Figs. 1 and 2, the thread guide mechanism 38 is preferably multipart.<br>
The thread guide mechanism 38, for example, has an upper tube 36 fixed to a stationarily arranged adapter 40 and a lower tube 37 which is displaceably arranged with respect to this upper tube 36 and adjustable with regard to its working position, for example, via a drive 39. The lower edge 50 of the lower tube 37 of the thread guide mechanism 38 is constantly arranged above the tube tip of the tube 41 of a spinning cop 9 positioned in the unwinding position 10.<br><br><br>
The positioning of the thread guide mechanism 38 defined according to the invention, in particular, its lower tube 37 in a start position I and the defined positioning of the balloon limiter 27 in an initial position II is described below with the aid of Fig. 3 and Fig. 4.<br>
As indicated in Fig. 3, a certain axial spacing, which is designated by Al, is provided in the start position I between the lower edge 50 of the lower tube 37 and the lower edge 45 of the tube 41 of a spinning cop 9 positioned in the spinning position 10. The tube 41 of the spinning cop 9 has a length L, in this case.<br>
The spacing between the lower edge 50 of the lower tube 37 and the lowest winding of the corresponding spinning cop 9 is characterised by A4 in Fig. 3.<br>
As indicated in Fig. 4, the radial spacing between the lower edge of the inner face 46 of the balloon limiter 27 positioned in its initial position II and a surface of a winding cone 52 of the spinning cop 9 is designated by A2.<br>
The spacing D3 designates the spacing between upper edge 47 of the tube 41 and the lower edge 50 of the lower tube 37 of the thread guide mechanism 38, which is preferably configured in a funnel-shape in the thread feed region. Furthermore, a spacing D5 is shown in Fig. 4, which designates the respective spacing of the thread release point in the region of the surface of the winding cone 52 of the spinning cop 9 and the lower edge 50 of the thread guide lower tube 37. The spacing D5 changes constantly during the winding process, but tends to become larger during the winding process.<br>
Functioning of the method according to the invention:<br>
Prior to the beginning of rewinding a new yarn batch, the start position I of the thread guide mechanism 38 and the initial position II of the balloon limiter 27 are initially fixed at the relevant winding machine, preferably by means of a pilot<br><br><br>
spindle, taking into account various relevant yarn parameters, such as, for example, fineness of the yarn, yarn elasticity, length of the spinning cop tube, maximum cop diameter, winding tension and winding speed.<br>
A certain spacing Dl is determined as the start position I for the thread guide mechanism 38, in this case, taking into account the existing yarn parameters of the spinning cop 9. The spacing Dl in this case designates, as already described above, the spacing between the lower edge 50 of the lower tube 37 of the thread guide mechanism 38 and the lower edge 45 of a tube 41 of a spinning cop 9 positioned in the spinning position 10. Moreover, also taking into account the existing yarn parameters of the spinning cop 9, the initial position II for the balloon limiter 27 is also determined. In the initial position II, the lower edge of the inner face 46 of the balloon limiter 27 has a radial spacing D2 from the surface of a winding cone 52 of the spinning cop 9. The spacing D3 between the tube tip and lower edge 50 of the thread guide mechanism 38 is produced automatically here from the length of the tube 51 of the spinning cop 9 and the spacing D4 is produced from the length and position of the cop winding on the tube 41 of the spinning cop 9. The spacing D5 is produced during the winding process as the spacing between the lower edge 50 of the thread guide mechanism 38 and the run off point of the thread 51 from the surface of the winding cone 52 of the spinning cop 9.<br>
In the course of the rewinding process, in which the thread 51 is drawn off overhead from the spinning cop 9, the balloon limiter 27 is tracked, following the unwinding progress, in such a way that the thread 51 constantly rotates in the form of a single thread balloon before it receives contact with the thread guide mechanism 38. In other words, the spacing D2 between the lower edge of the inner face 46 of the balloon limiter 27 and the surface of the winding cone 52 of the spinning cop 9 remains substantially constant.<br>
The thread tension of the thread 51 to be rewound is monitored, in this case, by means of a thread tensile force sensor 20 and optionally corrected by corresponding<br><br><br>
regulating interventions of a thread tensioner 14. If the thread tensile force sensor establishes, for example during the rewinding process, that a thread tension correction is no longer possible by means of the thread tensioner 14, the control mechanism 60 of the winding head 2 reacts by a corresponding activation of the drive 39 of the thread guide mechanism 38. In other words, if, during the winding process, the measured thread tension becomes too low despite a maximally closed thread tensioner 14, the thread guide mechanism 38 is slightly raised and the spacing D3 increased thereby.<br>
The spacing D3 can be increased at most until the axial spacing Dl of the lower edge 50 of the thread guide mechanism 38 is approximately 10 times the length L of the tube 41 of the spinning cop 9 positioned in the winding position 10.<br>
Accordingly, the spacing D3 is reduced by the control mechanism 60 if the thread tensile force sensor 20 establishes during the winding process that the measured thread tension is too high despite a maximally opened thread tensioner 14. The spacing A3 is, in this case, reduced to a maximum of 3 mm or to 4 times the yarn diameter of the yarn material of the spinning cop 9.<br><br><br>

14.	Method according to claim 11, characterised in that if, during the winding process, the measured thread tension becomes too high despite a maximally opened thread tensioner (14), the spacing (D3) is reduced.<br><br><br>
15.	Method according to claim 14, characterised in that the spacing (D3) is reduced to a maximum of 2 mm or to 4 times the yarn diameter of the yarn material of the spinning cop (9).<br>
16.	Method according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the continuous adjustment of the spacings (D2 and/or D3) during the winding process takes place based on curves, which are stored in a memory of a control mechanism.<br><br><br><br>
ABSTRACT<br>
The invention relates to a method for operating a winding head (2) of a textile machine (1) producing cross-wound bobbins, on which a thread (51) is drawn off overhead from a spinning cop (9) with the formation of a thread balloon. The winding head (2) has an auxiliary unwinding device (23) with a thread guide mechanism (38) and a balloon limiter (27) which can be lowered over the spinning cop (9).<br>
It is provided according to the invention that, prior to the start of a batch or when a<br>
batch is changed, the thread guide mechanism (38) is positioned in a start position<br>
(I), in which the lower edge (50) of the thread guide mechanism (38) has a certain<br>
axial spacing (Al) from the lower edge (45) of a tube (41) of a spinning cop (9)<br>
positioned in an unwinding position (10), the axial spacing (Dl) being adjusted as a<br>
function of at least one of the respectively existing yarn parameters of the spinning<br>
cop (9). In addition, the balloon limiter (27) is initially positioned with respect to the<br>
surface of a winding cone (52) of the spinning cop (9) in an initial position (II), in<br>
which a certain radial spacing (D2) is provided between the lower edge of the inner<br>
face (46) of the balloon limiter (27) and the surface of the winding cone (52), which<br>
spacing is also adjusted as a function of one of the resepctively existing yarn<br>
parameters of the spinning cop (9).<br><br></td>
