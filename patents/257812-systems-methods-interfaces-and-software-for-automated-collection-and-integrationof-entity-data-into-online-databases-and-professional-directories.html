Cross-Reference to Related Application<br>
This application claims priority to U.S. provisional application 60/533,588<br>
filed on December 31,2003. The provisional application is incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
Technical Field<br>
Various embodiments of the present invention concerns information-retrieval<br>
systems, such as those that provide legal documents or other related content.<br>
Background<br>
In recent years, the fantastic growth of the Internet and other computer<br>
networks has fueled an equally fantastic growth in the data accessible via these<br>
networks. One of the seminal modes for interacting with this data is through the use<br>
of hyperlinks within electronic documents.<br>
More recently, there has been interest in hyperlinking documents to other<br>
documents based on the names of people in the documents. For example, to facilitate<br>
legal research, West Publishing Company of Si Paul, Minnesota (doing business as<br>
Thomson West) provides thousands of electronic judicial opinions that hyperlink the<br>
names of attorneys and judges to their online biographical entries in the West Legal<br>
Directory, a proprietary directory of approximately 1,000,000 U.S. attorneys and<br><br>
20,000 judges. These hyperlinks allow users accessing judicial opinions to quickly<br>
obtain contact and other specific information about lawyers and judges named in the<br>
opinions.<br>
The hyperlinks in these judicial opinions are generated automatically, using a<br>
system mat extracts first, middle, and last names; law firm name, city, and state; and<br>
court information from the text of the opinions and uses them as clues to determine<br>
whether to link the named attorneys and judges to their corresponding entries in the<br>
professional directory. See Christopher Dozier and Robert Haschart, "Automatic<br>
Extraction and Linking of Person Names in Legal Text" (Proceedings of RIAO 2000;<br>
Content Based Multimedia Information Access, Paris, France, pp. 1305-1321. April<br>
2000), which is incorporated herein by reference. An improvement to this system is<br>
described in Christopher Dozier, System, Methods And Software For Automatic<br>
Hyperl inking Of Persons' Names In Documents To Professional Directories, WO<br>
2003/060767A3 July 24,2003.<br>
The present inventors have recognized still additional need for improvement in<br>
these and other systems that generale automatic links-<br>

Exemplary court-filing documents include briefs, motions, complaints, pleadings,<br>
discovery matter. Other databases 115 includes one or more other databases.<br>
containing documents regarding news stories, business and finance, science and<br>
technology, medicine and bioinformatics, and intellectual property information. In<br>
some embodiments, the logical relationships across documents are determined<br>
manually or using automatic discovery processes that leverage information such as<br>
litigant identities, dates, jurisdictions, attorney identifies, court dockets, and so forth<br>
to determine the existence or likelihood of a relationship between any pair of<br>
documents.<br>
Databases 110, which take the exemplary form of one or more electronic,<br>
magnetic, or optical data-storage devices, include or are otherwise associated with<br>
respective indices (not shown). Each of the indices includes terms and/or phrases in<br>
association with corresponding document addresses, identifiers, and other information<br>
for facilitating the functionality described below. Databases 112, 114, and 116 are<br>
coupled or couplable via a wireless or wireline communications network, such as a<br>
local-, wide-, private-, or virtual-private network, to server 120.<br>
Server 120, which is generally representative of one or more servers for<br>
serving data in the form of webpages or other markup language forms with associated<br>
applets, ActiveX controls, remote-invocation objects, or other related software and<br>
data structures to service clients of various "thicknesses." More particularly, server<br>
120 includes a processor 121, a memory 122, a subscriber database 123, one or more<br>
search engines 124 and software module 125.<br>
Processor 121, which is generally representative of one or more local or<br>
distributed processors or virtual machines, is coupled to memory 122. Memory 122,<br>
which takes the exemplary form of one or more electronic, magnetic, or optical data-<br>
storage devices, stores subscription database 123, search engines 124, and interface<br>
module 125.<br><br>
Subscription database 123 includes subscriber-related data for controlling,<br>
administering, and managing pay-as-you-go- or subscription-based access of<br>
databases 110. Subscriber database 123 includes subscriber-related data for<br>
controlling, administering, and managing pay-as-you-go or subscription-based access<br>
of databases 110.<br>
Search engines 124 provides Boolean or natural-language search capabilities<br>
for databases 110.<br>
Interface module 125, which, among, other things defines one or portion of a<br>
graphical user interface that helps users define searches for databases 110. Software<br>
125 includes one or more browser-compatible applets, webpage templates, user-<br>
interface elements, objects or control features or other programmatic objects or<br>
structures. More specifically, software 125 includes a search interface 1251 and a<br>
results interface 1252.<br>
Server 120 is communicatively coupled or couplable via a wireless or wireline<br>
communications network, such as a local-, wide-, private-, or virtual-private network,<br>
to one or more accesses devices, such as access device 130.<br>
Access device 130 is not only communicatively coupled or couplable to server<br>
130, but also generally representative of one or more access devices. In the<br>
exemplary embodiment, access device 130 takes the form of a personal computer,<br>
workstation, personal digital assistant, mobile telephone, or any other device capable<br>
of providing an effective user interface with a server or database.<br>
Specifically, access device 130 includes one or more processors (or processing<br>
circuits) 131, a memory 132, a display 133, a keyboard 134, and a graphical pointer or<br>
selector 135. Memory 132 stores code (machine-readable or executable instructions)<br>
for an operating system 136, a browser 137, and a graphical user interface (GUI) 138.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment, operating system 136 takes the form of a version of<br>
the Microsoft Windows operating system, and browser 137 takes the form of a<br>
version of Microsoft Internet Explorer. Operating system 136 and browser 137 not<br>
only receive inputs from keyboard 134 and selector (or mouse) 135, but also support<br>
rendering of GUI 138 on display 133. Upon rendering, GUI 138 presents data in<br>
association with one or more interactive control features (or user-interface elements).<br><br>
(The exemplary embodiment defines one or more portions of interface 138 using<br>
applets or other programmatic objects or structures from server 120.)<br>
Specifically, graphical user interface 138 defines or provides one or more<br>
display control regions, such as a query region 1381, and a results region 1382. Each<br>
region (or page in some embodiments) is respectively defined in memory to display<br>
data from databases 110 and/or server 120 in combination with one or more<br>
interactive control features (elements or widgets). In the exemplary embodiment,<br>
each of these control features takes the form of a hyperlink or other browser-<br>
compatible command input.<br>
More specifically, query region 1381 includes interactive control features,<br>
such as an query input portion 1381A for receiving user input at least partially<br>
defining a profile query and a query submission button 1381B for submitting the<br>
profile query to server 120 for data from, for example, experts database 112.<br>
Results region 1382, which displays search results for a submitted query,<br>
includes a results listing portion 1382A and a document display portion 1382B.<br>
Listing portion 1382A includes control features 2A1 and 2A2 for accessing or<br>
retrieving one or more corresponding search result documents, such as professional<br>
profile data and related documents, from one or more of databases 110, such as expert<br>
database 112, via server 120. Each control feature includes a respective document<br>
identifier or label, such as EXP I, EXP 2 identifying respective name and/or city,<br>
state, and subject-matter expertise data for the corresponding expert or professional.<br>
Display portion 1382B displays at least a portion of the full text of a first<br>
displayed or user-selected one of the profiles identified within listing portion 1382A,<br>
EXP 2 in the illustration. (Some embodiments present regions 1382A and 1382B as<br>
selectable tabbed regions.) Portion 1382B also includes features 2B1,2B2, 2B3, and<br>
2B4. User selection of feature 2B1 initiates retrieval and display of the profile text for<br>
the selected expert, EXP 2; selection of feature 2B2 initiates retrieval and display of<br>
licensing data for any licenses or other credentials held by the selected expert or<br>
professional image copy of the document displayed in region 1382B in a separate<br>
window; selection of feature 2B3 initiates display and retrieval of verdict data related<br>
to the expert or professional; and selection of feature 2B4 initiates retrieval and<br>
display of articles (from database 115) that are related to, for example authored by,<br><br>
the expert or professional. Other embodiments include additional control features for<br>
accessing court-filing documents, such as briefs, and/or expert reports authored by the<br>
expert or professional, or even deposition and trial transcripts where the expert or<br>
testimony was a participant. Still other embodiments provide control features for<br>
initiating an Internet search based on the selected expert and other data and for<br>
filtering results such search based on the profile of the expert or professional.<br>
Exemplary Methods of Operation<br>
Figure 2 shows a flow chart 200 of one or more exemplary methods of<br>
operating an information-management system, such as system 100. Flow chart 200<br>
includes blocks 210-290, which are arranged and described in a serial execution<br>
sequence in the exemplary embodiment. However, other embodiments execute two<br>
or more blocks in parallel using multiple processors or processor-like devices or a<br>
single processor organized as two or more virtual machines or sub processors. Other<br>
embodiments also alter the process sequence or provide different functional partitions<br>
to achieve analogous results. For example, some embodiments may alter the client-<br>
server allocation of functions, such that functions shown and described on the server<br>
side are implemented in whole or in part on the client side, and vice versa. Moreover,<br>
still other embodiments implement the blocks as two or more interconnected<br>
hardware modules with related control and data signals communicated between and<br>
through the modules. Thus, this (and other exemplary process flows in this<br>
description) apply to software, hardware, and firmware implementations.<br>
Block 210 entails presenting a search interface to a user. In the exemplary<br>
embodiment, this entails a user directing a browser in an client access device to<br>
internet-protocol (IP) address for an online information-retrieval system, such as the<br>
Westlaw system and then logging onto the system. Successful login results in a web-<br>
based search interface, such as interface 138 in Figure 1 (or one or more portions<br>
thereof) being output from server 120, stored in memory 132, and displayed by client<br>
access device 130.<br>
Execution then advances to block 220.<br>
Block 220 entails receipt of a query. In the exemplary embodiment, the query<br>
defines one or more attributes of an entity, such as person professional. In some<br><br>
embodiments, the query string includes a set of tenrts and/or connectors, and in other<br>
embodiment includes a natural-language string. Also, in some embodiments, the set<br>
of target databases is defined automatically or by default based on the form of the<br>
system or search interface. Figures 3 and 4 show alternative search interfaces 300 and<br>
400 which one or more embodiments use in place of interface 138 in Figure 1.<br>
Execution continues at block 230.<br>
Block 230 entails presenting search results to the user via a graphical user<br>
interface. In the exemplary embodiment, this entails the server or components under<br>
server control or command, executing the query against one or more of databases 110,<br>
for example, expert database 110, and identifying documents, such as professional<br>
profiles, that satisfy the query criteria. A listing of results is then presented or<br>
rendered as part of a web-based interface, such as interface 138 in Figure 1 or<br>
interface 500 in Figure 5. Execution proceeds to block 240.<br>
Block 240 entails presenting additional information regarding one or more one<br>
or more of the listed professionals. In the exemplary embodiment, this entails<br>
receiving a request in the form of a user selection of one or more of the professional<br>
profiles listed in the search results. These additional results may be displayed as<br>
shown in interface 138 in Figure 1 or respective interfaces 600,700, and 800 in<br>
Figures 6, 7, and 8. Interface 600 shows a listing of links 610 and 620 for additional<br>
information related to the selected professional. As shown in Figure 7, selection of<br>
link 610 initiates retrieval and display of a verdict document (or in some case a list of<br>
associated verdict documents) in interface 700. And, as shown in Figure 8, selection<br>
of link 620 initiates retrieval and display of an article (or in some cases a list of<br>
articles) in interface 800.<br>
Exemplary Method of Building Expert Directory<br>
In Figure 9, flow chart 900 shows an exemplary method of building an expert<br>
directory or database such as used in system 100. Flow chart 900 includes blocks<br>
910-960.<br><br>
At block 910, the exemplary method begins with extraction of entity reference<br>
records from text documents. In the exemplary embodiment, this entails extracting<br>
entity references from approximately 300,000 jury verdict settlement (JVS)<br>
documents using Finite state transducers. JVS documents have a consistent structure<br>
that includes an expert witness section or paragraph, such as that exemplified in Table<br>
1.<br><br>
Document<br>
The exemplary embodiment uses a parsing program to locate expert-witness<br>
paragraphs and find lexical elements (that is, terms used in this particular subject area)<br>
pertaining to an individual. These lexical elements include name, degree, area of<br>
expertise, organization, city, and state.	Parsing a paragraph entails separating it<br>
into sentences, and then parsing each element using a separate or specific finite state<br>
transducer. The following example displays regular expressions from the finite state<br>
transducer used for the organization element. (Variables are prefixed by S-)<br><br>
Typically one expert is listed in a sentence along with his or her area of expertise and<br>
other information. If more than one expert is mentioned in a sentence, area of<br>
expertise and other elements closest to the name are typically associated with that<br>
name. Each JVS document generally lists only one expert witness; however, some<br><br>
expert witnesses are references in more than one JVS document. Table 2 shows an<br>
example of an entity reference records.<br><br>
Once the entity reference records are defined, execution continues at block 220.<br>
Block 920 entails defining profile records from the entity reference records: In<br>
the exemplary embodiment, defining the profile records entails merging expert-<br>
witness reference records that refer to the same person to create a unique expert-<br>
witness profile record for the expert. To this end, the exemplary embodiment sorts<br>
the reference records by last name to define a number of lastname groups. Records<br>
within each "last-name" group are then processed by selecting an unmerged expert<br>
reference record and creating an new expert profile record from this selected record.<br>
The new expert reference record is then marked as unmerged and compared to each<br>
unmerged reference record in the group using Bayesian matching to compute the<br>
probability that the expert in the profile record refers to the same individual<br>
referenced in the record. If the computed match probability exceeds a match<br>
threshold, the reference is marked as "merged." Jf unmerged records remain in the<br>
group, the cycle is repeated.<br>
Note that it is still possible for duplicate records to reside in the profile file if<br>
two or more reference records pertain to one individual (for example, because of a<br>
misspelled last name). To address this possibility, a final pass is made over the<br>
merged profile file, and record pairs are flagged for manual review. Table 3 shows an<br>
exemplary expert profile record created from expert reference records.<br><br><br><br>
Block 930 entails adding additional information to the expert reference<br>
records. In the exemplary embodiment, this entail harvesting information from other<br>
databases and sources, such as from professional licensing authorities, telephone<br>
directories, and so forth. References to experts in JVS documents, the original entity<br>
record source in this embodiment, often have little or no location information for<br>
experts, whereas professional license records typically include the expert's full name,<br>
and the full current home and/or business address, making them a promising source<br>
for additional data.<br>
One exemplary licensing authority is the Drug Enforcement Agency, which licenses<br>
health-care professionals to prescribe drugs.<br>
In determining whether a harvested license record (analogous to a reference<br>
record) and expert person refer to the same person, the exemplary embodiment<br>
computes a Bayesian match probability based on first name, middle name, last name,<br>
name suffix, city-state information, area of expertise, and name rarity. If the match<br>
probability meets or exceeds a threshold probability, one or more elements of<br>
information from the harvested license record are incorporated into the expert<br>
reference record. If the threshold criteria is not met, the harvested license record is<br>
stored in a database for merger consideration with later added or harvested records.<br>
In.<br><br>
(Some embodiments perform an extraction procedure on the supplemental data<br>
similar to that described at block 910 to define reference records, which are then sent<br>
as a set for merger processing as in block 910 with the expert reference records.)<br><br>
Block 940 entails categorizing expert profiles by area of expertise. In the<br>
exemplary embodiment, each expert witness record is assigned one or more<br>
classification categories in an expertise taxonomy. Categorization of the entity records<br>
allows users to browse and search expert witness (or other professional) profiles by<br>
area of expertise. To map an expert profile record to an expertise subcategory, the<br>
exemplary embodiment uses an expertise categorizer and a taxonomy that contains<br>
top-level categories and subcategories.<br>
The exemplary taxonomy includes the following top-level categories:<br>
Accident &amp; Injury; Accounting &amp; Economics; Computers &amp; Electronics;<br>
Construction &amp; Architecture; Criminal, Fraud and Personal Identity; Employment &amp;<br>
Vocational; Engineering &amp; Science; Environmental; Family &amp; Child Custody; Legal<br>
&amp; Insurance; Medical &amp; Surgical; Property &amp; Real Estate; Psychiatry &amp; Psychology;<br>
Vehicles, Transportation, Equipment &amp; Machines. Each categories includes one or<br><br>
more subcategories. For example, the "Accident &amp; Injury" category has the following<br>
subcategories: Aerobics, Animals, Apparel, Asbestos, Boating, Bombing,<br>
Burn/Thermal, Child Care, Child Safety, Construction, Coroner,<br>
Cosmetologists/Beauticians/Barbers/Tattoos, Dog Bites, Entertainment, and Exercise.<br>
Assignment of subject-matter categories to an expert profile record entail<br>
using a function that maps a professional descriptor associated with the expert to a<br>
leaf node in the expertise taxonomy. This function is represented with the following<br>
equation:<br>
T = f(S)<br>
where T denotes a set of taxonomy nodes, and S is the professional descriptor. The<br>
exemplary function/uses a lexicon of 500 four-character sets that map professional<br>
descriptors to expertise area. For example, experts having the "onco" professional<br>
descriptor are categorized to the oncology specialist, oncologist, and pediatric<br>
oncologist subcategories. Other taxonomies are also feasible. The exemplary<br>
embodiment allows descriptors to map to more than one expertise area (that is,<br>
category or subcategory) in the taxonomy. For example, "pediatric surgeon" can be<br>
mapped to both the "pediatrics" node and "surgery" nodes. Table 5 shows an<br>
example of an expert profile record in which the expertise field has been mapped to<br>
the category "Medical &amp; Surgical" and to the subcategories "pediatrics," "blood &amp;<br>
plasma," and "oncology."<br><br><br>
to "Medical &amp; Surgical"<br>
Block 940 entails associating one or more text documents and/or additional<br>
data sets with one or more of the professional profiles. To this end, the exemplary<br>
embodiment logically associates or links one or more JVS documents and/or Medline<br>
articles to expert-witness profile records using Bayesian based record matching.<br>
Table 6 shows a sample Medline article.<br><br>
To link JVS documents and medline abstracts to expert profile records, expert-<br>
reference records are extracted from the articles using one or more suitable parsers<br>
through parsing and matched to profile records using a Bayesian inference network<br>
similar to the profile-matching technology described previously. For JVS documents,<br>
the Bayesian network computes match probabilities using seven pieces of match<br>
evidence: last name, first name, middle name, name suffix, location, organization, and<br>
area of expertise. For medline articles, the match probability is based additionally on<br>
name rarity, as described in the previously mentioned Dozier patent application.<br>
Figure 10 shows a flow chart 1000 of an exemplary method of growing and<br>
maintaining one or more entity directories, such expert database that used in system<br>
100. Flow chart 1100 includes process blocks 1010-1050.<br>
At block 1010, the exemplary method begins with receipt of a document. In<br>
the exemplary embodiment, this entails receipt of an unmarked document, such an a<br>
judicial opinion or brief. However, other embodiments receive and process other<br>
types of documents. Execution then advances to block 1020.<br><br>
Block 1020 entails determining the type of document. The exemplary<br>
embodiments uses one or more methods for determining document type, for example,<br>
looking for particular document format and syntax and/or keywords to differentiate<br>
among a set of types. In some embodiments, type can be inferred from the source of<br>
the document. Incoming content types, such as case law, jury verdicts, law reviews,<br>
briefs, etc., have a variety of grammar, syntax, and structural differences. After type<br>
(or document description) is determined, execution continues at block 1030.<br>
Block 1030 entails extracting one or more entity reference records from the<br>
received document based on the determined type of the document. In the exemplary<br>
embodiment, four types of entity records are extracted: personal names, such as<br>
attorneys, judges, expert witnesses; organizational names, such as firms and companies;<br>
product names, such as drugs and chemicals; and fact profiles ("vernacular" of subject<br>
area). Specialized or configurable parsers (finite state transducers), which are<br>
selected or configured on the basis of the determined document type and the entity<br>
record being built, identify and extract entity information for each type of entity.<br>
Parsers extract information by specifically searching for a named entity<br>
(person, address, company, etc.) or by relationships between entities. Parser text-<br>
extraction is based on the data's input criteria. For example, the more structured<br>
(tagged) data enables a "tighter" set of rales to be built within a parser. This set of<br>
rules allows more specific information to be extracted about a particular entity. A<br>
more "free" data collection, such as a web site, is not as conducive to rule-based<br>
parsers. A collection could also include a combination of structured, semi-structured,<br>
and free data. More specifically, parsers are developed through "regular-expression"<br>
methods. The regular expressions serves are "rules" for parsers to find entity types<br>
and categories of information.<br>
Block 1040 attempts to link or logically associate each extracted entity<br>
reference record with one or more existing authority directories. In the exemplary<br>
embodiment, this entails computing a Bayesian match probability for each extracted<br>
entity reference and one more corresponding candidate records in corresponding<br>
directories (or databases) that have been designated as authoritative in terms of<br>
accepted accuracy. If the match probability satisfies match criteria, the records are<br><br>
merged or associated and the input document. Execution then proceeds to block<br>
1050.<br>
Block 1050 entails enriching unmatched entity reference records using a<br>
matching process. In the exemplary embodiment, this enriching process entails<br>
operating specific types of data harvesters on the web, other databases, and other<br>
directories or lists, to assemble a cache of new relevant profile information for<br>
databases, such as expert database 112 in Figure 1. The unmatched or unmarked<br>
entity records are then matched against the harvested entity records using Bayesian<br>
matching. Those that satisfy the match criteria are referred to a quality control<br>
process for verification or confirmation prior to addition to the relevant entity<br>
directory. The quality control process may be manual, semi-automatic, or fully<br>
automatic. For example, some embodiments base the type of quality control on the<br>
degree to which the match criteria is exceeded.<br>
In some embodiments, blocks 1050 operates in parallel with blocks 1010-<br>
1040, continually retrieving new entity related data using any number of web<br>
crawlers, relational databases, or CDs, and attempting to building new entity records.<br>
