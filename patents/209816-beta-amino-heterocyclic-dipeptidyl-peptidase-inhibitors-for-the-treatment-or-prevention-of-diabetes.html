FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to compounds which are inhibitors of the dipeptidyl peptidase-IV enzyme ("DP-IV inhibitors") and which are useful in the treatment or prevention of diseases in which the dipeptidyl peptidase-IV enzyme is involved, such as diabetes and particularly type 2 diabetes. The invention is also directed to pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds and the use of these compounds and compositions. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Diabetes refers to a disease process derived from multiple causative factors and characterized by elevated levels of plasma glucose or hyperglycemia in the fasting state or after administration of glucose during an oral glucose tolerance test. Persistent or uncontrolled hyperglycemia is associated with increased and premature morbidity and mortality. Often abnormal glucose homeostasis is associated both directly and indirectly with alterations of the lipid, lipoprotein and apolipoprotein metabolism and other metabolic and hemodynamic disease. Therefore patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus are at especially increased risk of macrovascular and microvascular complications, including coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy. Therefore, therapeutical control of glucose homeostasis, lipid metabolism and hypertension are critically important in the clinical management and treatment of diabetes mellitus.<br>
There are two generally recognized forms of diabetes. In type 1 diabetes, or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), patients produce little or no insulin, the hormone which regulates glucose utilization. In type 2 diabetes, or noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), patients often have plasma insulin levels that are the same or even elevated compared to nondiabetic subjects; however, these patients have developed a resistance to the insulin stimulating effect on glucose and lipid metabolism in the main insulin-sensitive tissues, which are muscle, liver and adipose tissues, and the plasma insulin levels, while elevated, are insufficient to overcome the pronounced insulin resistance.<br>
Insulin resistance is not primarily due to a diminished number of insulin receptors but to a post-insulin receptor binding defect that is not yet understood. This resistance to insulin responsiveness results in insufficient insulin activation of glucose uptake, oxidation and storage in muscle and inadequate insulin repression of lipolysis in adipose tissue and of glucose production and secretion in the liver.<br>
The available treatments for type 2 diabetes, which have not changed substantially in many years, have recognized limitations. While physical exercise and reductions in dietary intake of calories will dramatically improve the diabetic<br><br>
condition, compliance with this treatment is very poor because of well-entrenched sedentary lifestyles and excess food consumption, especially of foods containing high amounts of saturated fat. Increasing the plasma level of insulin by administration of sulfonylureas (e.g. tolbutamide and glipizide) or meglitinide, which stimulate the pancreatic Pâ€”cells to secrete more insulin, and/or by injection of insulin when sulfonylureas or meglitinide become ineffective, can result in insulin concentrations high enough to stimulate the very insulin-resistant tissues. However, dangerously low levels of plasma glucose can result from administration of insulin or insulin secretagogues (sulfonylureas or meglitinide), and an increased level of insulin resistance due to the even higher plasma insulin levels can occur. The biguanides increase insulin sensitivity resulting in some correction of hyperglycemia. However, the two biguanides, phenformin and metformin, can induce lactic acidosis and nausea/diarrhea. Metformin has fewer side effects than phenformin and is often prescribed for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes.<br>
The glitazones (i.e. 5-benzylthiazolidine-2,4-diones) are a more recently described class of compounds with potential for ameliorating many symptoms of type 2 diabetes. These agents substantially increase insulin sensitivity in muscle, liver and adipose tissue in several animal models of type 2 diabetes resulting in partial or complete correction of the elevated plasma levels of glucose without occurrence of hypoglycemia. The glitazones that are currently marketed are agonists of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR), primarily the PPAR-gamma subtype. PPAR-gamma agonism is generally believed to be responsible for the improved insulin sensitization that is observed with the glitazones. Newer PPAR agonists that are being tested for treatment of Type II diabetes are agonists of the alpha, gamma or delta subtype, or a combination of these, and in many cases are chemically different from the glitazones (i.e., they are not thiazolidinediones). Serious side effects (e.g. liver toxicity) have occurred with some of the glitazones, such as troglitazone.<br>
Additional methods of treating the disease are still under investigation. New biochemical approaches that have been recently introduced or are still under development include treatment with alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (e.g. acarbose) and protein tyrosine phosphatase-IB (PTP-1B) inhibitors.<br>
Compounds that arc inhibitors of the dipeptidyl peptidase-lV ("DP-IV" or "DPP-IV") enzyme are also under investigation as drugs that may be useful in the treatment of diabetes, and particularly type 2 diabetes. See for example WO<br><br>
97/40832, WO 98/19998, U.S. Patent No. 5,939,560, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 6(10), 1 163-! 166 (1996); and Bioorg. Med Chem. Lett., 6(22), 2745-2748 (1996). The usefulness of DP-IV inhibitors in the treatment of type 2 diabetes is based on the fact that DP-IV in vivo readily inactivates glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP). GLP-1 and GIP are incretins and are produced when food is consumed. The incretins stimulate production of insulin. Inhibition of DP-IV leads to decreased inactivation of the incretins, and this in turn results in increased effectiveness of the incretins in stimulating production of insulin by the pancreas. DP-IV inhibition therefore results in an increased level of serum insulin. Advantageously, since the incretins are produced by the body only when food is consumed, DP-IV inhibition is not expected to increase the level of insulin at inappropriate times, such as between meals, which can lead to excessively low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). Inhibition of DP-IV is therefore expected to increase insulin without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia, which is a dangerous side effect associated with the use of insulin secretagogues.<br>
DP-IV inhibitors also have other therapeutic utilities, as discussed herein. DP-IV inhibitors have not been studied extensively to date, especially for utilities other than diabetes. New compounds are needed so that improved DP-IV inhibitors can be found for the treatment of diabetes and potentially other diseases and conditions.<br>

The compounds of the present invention may contain one or more asymmetric centers and can thus occur as racemates and racemic mixtures, single enantiomers, diastereomeric mixtures and individual diastereomers. The compounds of the instant invention have one asymmetric center at the beta carbon atom. Additional asymmetric centers may be present depending upon the nature of the various substituents on the molecule. Each such asymmetric center will independently produce two optical isomers and it is intended that all of the possible optical isomers and diastereomers in mixtures and as pure or partially purified compounds arc included within the ambit of this invention. The present invention is meant to comprehend all such isomeric forms of these compounds.<br>
Some of the compounds described herein contain olefinic double bonds, and unless specified otherwise, are meant to include both E and Z geometric isomers.<br>
Some of the compounds described herein may exist as tautomers, which have different points of attachment of hydrogen accompanied by one or more double bond shifts.  For example, a ketone and its cnol form are kcto-cnol tautomers.<br><br>
The individual tautomers as well as mixtures thereof are encompassed with compounds of the present invention.<br>
Formula I shows the structure of the class of compounds without preferred stereochemistry.  Formula la shows the preferred sterochemistry at the carbon atom that is attached to the amine group of the beta amino acid from which these compounds are prepared.<br>
The independent syntheses of these diastercomers or their chromatographic separations may be achieved as known in the art by appropriate modification of the methodology disclosed herein. Their absolute stereochemistry may be determined by the x-ray crystallography of crystalline products or crystalline intermediates which are derivatized, if necessary, with a reagent containing an asymmetric center of known absolute configuration.<br>
If desired, racemic mixtures of the compounds may be separated so that the individual enantiomers arc isolated. The separation can be carried out by methods well known in the art, such as the coupling of a racemic mixture of compounds to an enantiomerically pure compound to form a diastereomeric mixture, followed by separation of the individual diastereomers by standard methods, such as fractional crystallization or chromatography. Hie coupling reaction is often the formation of salts using an enantiomerically pure acid or base. The diasteromeric derivatives may then be converted to the pure enantiomers by cleavage of the added chiral residue. The racemic mixture of the compounds can also be separated directly by chromatographic methods utilizing chiral stationary phases, which methods are well known in the art.<br>
Alternatively, any enantiomer of a compound may be obtained by stereoselective synthesis using optically pure starting materials or reagents of known configuration by methods well known in the art.<br>

The utility of the compounds in accordance with the present invention as inhibitors of dipeptidyl pcptidase-IV enzyme activity may be demonstrated by methodology known in the art. Inhibition constants are determined as follows. A continuous fluorometric assay is employed with the substrate Gly-Pro-AMC, which is cleaved by DP-IV to release the fluorescent AMC leaving group. The kinetic parameters that describe this reaction are as follows: Km = 50 \xM; kait = 75 s" ; kcat/Km = 1.5 x 106 IVf's'1.   A typical reaction contains approximately 50 pM enzyme, 50 jiM Gly-Pro-AMC, and buffer (100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1 mg/ml BSA) in a total reaction volume of 100 (al. Liberation of AMC is monitored continuously in a 96-wcIl plate fluoromeler using an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm. Under these conditions, approximately 0.8 jaM AMC is produced in 30 minutes at 25 degrees C. The enzyme used in these studies was soluble (transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic extension excluded) human protein produced in a baculovirus expression system (Bac-To-Bac, Gibco BRL).   The kinetic constants for hydrolysis of Gly-Pro-AMC and GLP-1 were found to be in accord with literature values for the native enzyme. To measure the dissociation constants for compounds, solutions of inhibitor in DMSO were added to reactions containing enzyme and substrate (final DMSO concentration is 1%). All experiments were<br><br>
conducted at room temperature using the standard reaction conditions described above. To determine the dissociation constants (Kj), reaction rates were fit by nonlinear regression to the Michaelis-Mcnton equation lor competitive inhibition. The errors in reproducing the dissociation constants are typically less than two-fold.<br>
In particular, the compounds of the following examples had activity in inhibiting the dipeptidyl peptidase-IV enzyme in the aforementioned assays, generally with an [C50 of less than about 1 JLIM. Such a result is indicative of the intrinsic<br>
activity of the compounds in use as inhibitors the dipeptidyl peptidase-IV enzyme activity.<br>
Dipeptidyl peptidase-IV enzyme (DP-IV) is a cell surface protein that has been implicated in a wide range of biological functions. It has a broad tissue distribution (intestine, kidney, liver, pancreas, placenta, thymus, spleen, epithelial cells, vascular endothelium, lymphoid and myeloid cells, serum), and distinct tissue and cell-type expression levels. DP-IV is identical to the T cell activation marker CD26, and it can cleave a number of immunoregulatory, endocrine, and neurological peptides in vitro. This has suggested a potential role for this peptidase in a variety of disease processes in humans or other species.<br>
Accordingly, the subject compounds are useful in a method for the prevention or treatment of the following diseases, disorders and conditions.<br>
Type II Diabetes and Related Disorders:  It is well established that the incretins GLP-l and GIP are rapidly inactivated in vivo by DP-IV. Studies with DP-IV^-deficient mice and preliminary clinical trials indicate that DP-IV inhibition increases the steady state concentrations of GLP-l and GIP, resulting in improved glucose tolerance. By analogy to GLP-l and GIP, it is likely that other glucagon family peptides involved in glucose regulation are also inactivated by DP-IV (eg. PACAP, glucagon). Inactivation of these peptides by DP-IV may also play a role in glucose homeostasis.<br>
The DP-IV inhibitors of the present invention therefore have utility in the treatment of type II diabetes and in the treatment and prevention of the numerous conditions that often accompany Type II diabetes, including metabolic syndrome X, reactive hypoglycemia, and diabetic dyslipidemia. Obesity, discussed below, is another condition that is often found with Type II diabetes that may respond to treatment with the compounds of this invention.<br>
The following diseases, disorders and conditions arc related to Type 2 diabetes, and therefore may be treated, controlled or in some cases prevented, by<br><br>
treatment with the compounds of this invention: (1) hyperglycemia, (2) low glucose tolerance, (3) insulin resistance, (4) obesity, (5) lipid disorders. (6) dyslipidcmia, (7) hyperlipidcmia, (8) hypertriglyceridemia, (9) hypercholesterolemia,   (10) low HDL levels, (II) high LDL levels, (12) atherosclerosis and its sequelae, (13) vascular restenosis, (14) irritable bowel syndrome, (15) inflammatory bowel disease, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, (16) other inflammatory conditions, (17)   pancreatitis, (18) abdominal obesity, (19) neurodegenerative disease, (20) retinopathy, (21) nephropathy, (22) neuropathy, (23) Syndrome X, (24) ovarian hyperandrogenism (polycystic ovarian syndrome), and other disorders where insulin resistance is a component.<br>
Obesity: DP-IV inhibitors may be useful for the treatment of obesity. This is based on the observed inhibitory effects on food intake and gastric emptying of GLP-1 and GLP-2. Lxogcnous administration of GLP-1 in humans significantly decreases food intake and slows gastric emptying (Am. J. Physiol. 277, R910-R916 (1999)). 1CV administration of GLP-1 in rats and mice also has profound effects on food intake (Nature Medicine 2, 1254-1258 (1996)). This inhibition of feeding is not observed in GLP-1 R(/) mice, indicating that these effects arc mediated through brain GLP-1 receptors. By analogy to GLP-1, it is likely that GLP-2 is also regulated by DP-1V. ICV administration ofGLP-2 also inhibits food intake, analogous to the effects observed with GLP-1 (Nature Medicine 6, 802-807 (2000)).<br>
Growth Hormone Deficiency: DP-IV inhibition may be useful for the treatment of growth hormone deficiency, based on the hypothesis that growth-hormone releasing factor (GRF), a peptide that stimulates release of growth hormone from the anterior pituitary, is cleaved by the DP-IV enzyme in vivo (WO 00/56297). The following data provide evidence that GRF is an endogenous substrate: (1) GRF is efficiently cleaved in vitro to generate the inactive product GRF[3-44] (BBA 1122, 147-153(1992)); (2) GRF is rapidly degraded in plasma to GRF[3-44]; this is prevented by the DP-IV inhibitor diprotin A; and (3) GRF[3-44] is found in the plasma of a human GRF transgenic pig (J. Clin. Invest. 83, 1533-1540 (1989)). Thus DP-IV inhibitors may be useful for the same spectrum of indications which have been considered for growth hormone secrctagogues.<br><br>
Intestinal Injury; The potential for using DP-IV inhibitors for the treatment of intestinal injury is suggested by the results of studies indicating that glucagon-like pcptide-2 (GLP-2), a likely endogenous substrate for DP-IV, may exhibit trophic effects on the intestinal epithelium (Regulatory Peptides 90, 27-32 (2000)). Administration of GLP-2 results in increased small bowel mass in rodents and attenuates intestinal injury in rodent models of colitis and enteritis.<br>
Immunosuppression: DP-IV inhibition may be useful for modulation of the immune response, based upon studies implicating the DP-IV enzyme in T cell activation and in chemokine processing, and efficacy of DP-IV inhibitors in in vivo models of disease. DP-IV has been shown to be identical to CD26, a cell surface marker for activated immune cells. The expression of CD26 is regulated by the differentiation and activation status of immune cells. It is generally accepted that CD26 functions as a co-stimulatory molecule in in vitro models of T cell activation. A number of chemokines contain proline in the penultimate position, presumably to protect them from degradation by non-specific aminopeptidases. Many of these have been shown to be processed in vitro by DP-IV. In several cases (RANTES, LD78-beta, MDC, eotaxin, SDF-1 alpha), cleavage results in an altered activity in chemotaxis and signaling assays.   Receptor selectivity also appears to be modified in some cases (R ANTES). Multiple N-terminally truncated forms of a number of chemokines have been identified in in vitro cell culture systems, including the predicted products of DP-IV hydrolysis.<br>
DP-IV inhibitors have been shown to be efficacious immunosupressants in animal models of transplantation and arthritis. Prodipine (Pro-Pro-diphenyl-phosphonate), an irreversible inhibitor of DP-IV, was shown to double cardiac allograft survival in rats from day 7 to day 14 (Transplantation 63, 1495-1500 (1997)). DP-IV inhibitors have been tested in collagen and alkyldiaminc-induced arthritis in rats and showed a statistically significant attenuation of hind paw swelling in this model (Int. J. Immunopharmacology 19, 15-24 (1997), Immunopharmacology 40. 21-26 (1998)).  DP-IV is uprcgulatcd in a number of autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, Graves' disease, and Hashimoto's thyroiditis (Immunology Today 20, 367-375 (1999)).<br>
II1V Infection:  DP-IV inhibition may be useful for the treatment or prevention of HIV infection or AIDS because a number of chemokines which inhibit HIV cell entry arc<br><br>
potential substrates for DP-IV (Immunology Today 20, 367-375 (1999)). In the case of SDF-1 alpha, cleavage decreases antiviral activity (PNAS 95, 6331-6 (1998)). Thus, stabilization of SDF-1 alpha through inhibition of DP-IV would be expected to decrease HIV infectivity.<br>
Hematopoiesis: DP-IV inhibition may be useful for the treatment or prevention of hematopicsis because DP-IV maybe involved in hematopoiesis. A DP-IV inhibitor, Vai-Boro-Pro, stimulated hematopoiesis in a mouse model of cyclophosphamide-induced neutropenia (WO 99/56753).<br>
Neuronal Disorders: DP-IV inhibition may be useful for the treatment or prevention of various neuronal or psychiatric disorders because a number of peptides implicated in a variety of neuronal processes arc cleaved in vitro by DP-IV. A DP-IV inhibitor thus may have a therapeutic benefit in the treatment of neuronal disorders. Endomorphin-2, beta-casomorphin, and substance P have all been shown to be in vitro substrates for DP-IV.  In all cases, in vitro cleavage is highly efficient, with kc;il/Km ~ 10h M"Vl or greater. In an electric shock jump test model of analgesia in rats, a DP-IV inhibitor showed a significant effect that was independent of the presence of exogenous endomorphin-2 (Brain Research 815, 278-286 (1999)).<br>
Tumor Invasion and Metastasis:  DP-IV inhibition may be useful for the treatment or prevention of tumor invasion and metastasis because an increase or decrease in expression of several cctopcptidascs including DP-IV has been observed during the transformation of normal cells to a malignant phenotype (J. Exp. Med. 190, 301-305 (1999)). Up- or down-regulation of these proteins appears to be tissue and cell-type specific. For example, increased CD26/DP-IV expression has been observed on T cell lymphoma, T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, cell-derived thyroid carcinomas, basal cell carcinomas, and breast carcinomas. Thus, DP-IV inhibitors may have utility in the treatment of such carcinomas.<br>
Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy:  DP-IV inhibition may be useful for the treatment o[ benign prostatic hypertrophy because increased DP-IV activity was noted in prostate tissue from patients with BPH (Eur. J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochcm 30, 333-338 (1992)).<br><br>
Sperm motility/male contraception: DP-IV inhibition may be useful for the altering sperm motility and for male contraception because in seminal Fluid, prostatosomes, prostate derived organelles important for sperm motility, possess very high levels of DP-IV activity (Eur. J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem 30, 333-338 (1992)).<br>
Gingivitis: DP-IV inhibition may be useful for the treatment of gingivitis because DP-IV activity was found in gingival crevicular fluid and in some studies correlated with periodontal disease severity (Arch. Oral Biol. 37, 167-173 (1992)).<br>
Osteoporosis: DP-IV inhibition may be useful for the treatment or prevention o\' osteoporosis because GIP receptors are present in osteoblasts.<br>
Tthe compounds of the present invention have utility in treating or preventing one or more of the following conditions or diseases: (1) hyperglycemia, (2) low glucose tolerance, (3) insulin resistance, (4) obesity, (5) lipid disorders, (6) dyslipidemia,   (7) hypcrlipidcmia, (8) hypertriglyceridemia, (9) hypercholesterolemia, (10) low HDL levels, (11) high LDL levels, (12) atherosclerosis and its sequelae, (13) vascular restenosis, (14) irritable bowel syndrome, (15) inflammatory bowel disease, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, (16) other inflammatory conditions, (17)   pancreatitis, (18) abdominal obesity, (19) neurodegenerative disease, (20) retinopathy, (21) nephropathy, (22) neuropathy, (23) Syndrome X, (24) ovarian hyperandrogenism (polycystic ovarian syndrome), (25)   lypc II diabetes, (26) growth hormone deficiency, (27) neutropenia, (28) neuronal disorders, (29) tumor metastasis, (30) benign prostatic hypertrophy,   (32) gingivitis,   (33) hypertension, (34) osteoporosis, and other conditions that may be treated or prevented by inhibition of DP-IV.<br>

The pharmaceutical compositions for the administration of the compounds of this invention may conveniently be presented in dosage unit form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. All methods include the step of bringing the active ingredient into association with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the pharmaceutical compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing the active ingredient into association with a liquid carrier or a finely divided solid carrier or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired formulation. In the pharmaceutical composition the active object compound is included in an amount sufficient to produce the desired effect upon the process or condition of diseases. As used herein, the term "composition" is intended to encompass a product comprising the specified ingredients in the specified amounts, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combination of the specified ingredients in the specified amounts.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions containing the active ingredient may be in a form suitable for oral use, for example, as tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules,<br><br>

The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents such as those set forth above, and flavoring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an antioxidant such as ascorbic acid.<br>
Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and OUQ or more preservatives.  Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above.

The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptablc diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butanc diol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water,<br><br>
Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglyccridcs.  In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials are cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols.<br>
For topical use, creams, ointments, jellies, solutions or suspensions, etc., containing the compounds of The present invention are employed. (For purposes of this application, topical application shall include mouth washes and gargles.)<br>

In the treatment or prevention of conditions which require inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase-IV enzyme activity an appropriate dosage level will generally be about 0.01 to 500 mg per kg patient body weight per day which can be administered in single or multiple doses. Preferably, the dosage level will be about 0.1 to about 250 mg/kg per day; more preferably about 0.5 to about 100 mg/kg per day. A suitable dosage level may be about 0.01 to 250 mg/kg per day, about 0.05 to 100 mg/kg per day. or about 0.1 to 50 mg/kg per day. Within this range the dosage may be 0.05 to 0.5, 0.5 to 5 or 5 to 50 mg/kg per day. For oral administration, the compositions are preferably provided in the form of tablets containing 1.0 to 1000 milligrams of the active ingredient, particularly 1.0, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0. 20.0, 25.0, 50.0. 75.0, 100.0, 150.0, 200.0, 250.0, 300.0, 400.0, 500.0, 600.0, 750.0, 800.0, 900.0, and 1000.0 milligrams of the active ingredient for the symptomatic adjustment of the dosage to the patient to be treated. The compounds may be administered on a regimen of 1 to 4 times per day, preferably once or twice per day.<br>
When treating or preventing diabetes mellitus and/or hyperglycemia or hypertriglyceridemia or other diseases for which compounds of the present invention arc indicated, generally satisfactory results are obtained when the compounds of the present invention arc administered at a daily dosage of from about 0.1 milligram to about 100 milligram per kilogram of animal body weight, preferably given as a single<br><br>
daily dose or in divided doses two to six times a day, or in sustained release form. For most large mammals, the total daily dosage is from about 1.0 milligrams to about 1000 milligrams, preferably from about 1 milligrams to about 50 milligrams.  In the case of a 70 kg adult human, the total daily dose will generally be from about 7 milligrams to about 350 milligrams. This dosage regimen may be adjusted to provide the optimal therapeutic response.<br>
It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level and frequency of dosage for any particular patient may be varied and will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the metabolic stability and length of action of that compound, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, mode and time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the severity of the particular condition, and the host undergoing therapy.<br>
Several methods for preparing the compounds of this invention arc illustrated in the following Schemes and Examples. Starting materials are made according to procedures known in the art or as illustrated herein.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be prepared from beta amino acid intermediates such as those of formula II and substituted heterocyclic intermediates such as those of formula III, using standard peptide coupling conditions followed by deprotection. The preparation of these intermediates is described in the following schemes.<br><br>
where Ar, X and R1 are as defined above and P is a suitable nitrogen protecting group such as tert-butoxycarbonyl, bcnzyloxycarbonyl, or 9-fluorcnylmcthoxycarbonyl.<br><br><br>
Compounds of formula II are commercially available, known in the literature or may be conveniently prepared by a variety of methods familiar to those skilled in the art. One common route is illustrated in Scheme 1. Acid J_, which may be commercially available or readily prepared from the corresponding amino acid by protection using, for example, di-/^r/-butyl-dicarbonate (for P = Boc), carbobcnzyloxy chloride (for P - Chz), or AL(9-(]uorenylmethoxycarbonyloxy)succinimidc (for P ~ Fmoc), is treated with isobutyl chloroformate and a base such as triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine, followed by diazomethane. The resultant diazokctone is then treated with silver benzoate in a solvent such as methanol or aqueous dioxane and may be subjected to sonication following the procedure of Sewald et al., Synthesis, 837 (1997) in order to provide the beta amino acid II. As will be understood by those skilled in the art, for the preparation of cnantiomerically pure beta amino acids II, cnantiomcrically pure alpha amino acids I may be used. Alternate routes to these compounds can be found in the following reviews;  H. Juaristi. Knantioselective Synthesis of fi-Amino Acids, Ed., Wiley-VCH, New York: 1997, Juaristi et al., Aldrichimica Acta, 27, 3 (1994), Cole et al., Tetrahedron, 32, 9517 (1994).<br><br>
Compounds III are commercially available, known in the literature or may be conveniently prepared by a variety of methods familiar to those skilled in the art. One convenient method is shown in Scheme 2. Unsaturated derivative 2 is reduced, for example, by treatment with hydrogen gas and a catalyst such as palladium on carbon or platinum oxide in a solvent such as methanol or ethanol to provide Compound 111.<br><br><br>
Intermediates 2, from Scheme 2, arc themselves commercially available, known in the literature or may be conveniently prepared by a variety of methods familiar to those skilled in the.art. One such method when X is CR  is illustrated in Scheme 3. Aminopyrazine 3 is treated with a 2-haloketone such as 2-bromokctonc 4 in a solvent such as methanol or ethanol to provide intermediate 2a. Alternatively, for the preparation of intermediate 2a where R  is H, 2-bromo-dimcthylacetal 5 and a catalytic amount of acid such as hydrochloric acid may be employed instead of intermediate 4.<br><br>
A convenient method for the preparation of intermediate 2b, where X is N. is illustrated in Scheme 4. Chloropyrazine 6 is treated with hydrazine to provide hydrazinopyrazine 7. Compound 7 may be condensed with either an orthoestcr such as tricthyl orthocster 8 to give 2b or with a carboxylic acid 9 in polyphosphoric acid at elevated temperatures to give 2b.<br><br><br>
An alternate route for the preparation of Compound Illb wherein X is N is illustrated in Scheme 5. Compound J_2 is prepared according to the method outlined above employing dichloropyrazine J_0 instead of chloropyrazine 6. Compound [2 is then subjected to catalytic hydrogenation using a catalyst such as platinum oxide to provide Compound 1Mb, as its monohydrochloride salt.<br><br><br>
Intermediates II and III are coupled under standard peptide coupling conditions, for example, using I-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimidc (EDC), l-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBT), and a base, generally diisopropylethylamine, in a solvent such as N,N-dimethyIformamide (DMF) or dichloromethane for 3 to 48 hours at ambient temperature to provide intermediate J_3 as shown in Scheme 6. The protecting group is then removed with, for example, trifluoroacctic acid or methanolic hydrogen chloride in the case of Boc to give the desired amine I. The product is purified from unwanted side products, if necessary, by rccrystalli/ation, trituration, preparative thin layer chromatography, flash chromatography on silica gel as described by W. C. Still et al, J. Org, Chew., 43, 2923 (1978), or IIPLC. Compounds which arc purified by HPLC may be isolated as the corresponding salt. Purification of intermediates is achieved in the same manner.<br>
In some cases the intermediate J_3 from the coupling reaction described in Scheme 6 may be further modified before removal of the protecting group, for example, by manipulation of substituents on X or R'. These manipulations may include, but are not limited to. reduction, oxidation, alkvlation, acvlation. and hvdrolvsis reactions which are commonlv known to those skilled in the art.<br><br>
In some cases ihe order of carrying out the foregoing reaction schemes may be varied to facilitate the reaction or to avoid unwanted reaction products. The following examples are provided so that the invention might be more fully understood. These examples arc illustrative only and should not be construed as limiting the invention in any way.<br><br>
