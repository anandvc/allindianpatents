Description<br>
EMERGENCY-INFORMATION RECEIVING METHOD, MOBILE STATION, AND<br>
RADIO BASE STATION<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to an<br>
emergency-information receiving method in which a plurality of<br>
mobile stations receives emergency information in a mobile<br>
communication system in which a radio base station is configured<br>
to transmit a plurality of types of system information<br>
repeatedly within a modification period to the mobile stations<br>
via a broadcast channel, and to notify the mobile stations of<br>
a predetermined trigger via the broadcast channel regardless<br>
of the modification period. The present invention also relates<br>
to the mobile station and the radio base station.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002]<br>
Heretofore, the "ETWS (Earthquake and Tsunami Warning<br>
System)", the "PWS (Public Warning System)", and the like have<br>
been known as systems to transmit emergency information to<br>
multiple mobile stations.<br>
[0003]<br>
Use of a SIB (System Information Block) on a broadcast<br>
channel (BCCH: Broadcast Control Channel) to transmit emergency<br>
information to multiple mobile stations has been considered for<br>
such "ETWS/PWS".<br>
[0004]<br>
 <br>
In a conventional "ETWS/PWS", however, a radio base<br>
station is configured to transmit multiple types of system<br>
information (SIB1 to SIB8) repeatedly within a modification<br>
period (MP) . This causes a problem that, even if detecting<br>
occurrence of emergency information, the radio base station<br>
cannot make notification of the emergency information in the<br>
current modification period MP(n), and cannot transmit the<br>
emergency information until the next modification period<br>
MP(n+l) starts.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[0019]<br>
(Configuration of Mobile Communication System according to<br>
First Embodiment of Present Invention)<br>
With reference to Figs. 1 to 8, the configuration of a<br>
mobile communication system according to a first embodiment of<br>
the present invention will be described.<br>
[0020]<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, in the mobile communication system<br>
according to this embodiment, a radio base station eNB is<br>
 <br>
configured to transmit multiple kinds of system information MIB<br>
(Master Information Block) and SIB1 to SIB9 repeatedly within<br>
a modification period MP, to multiple UEs via a broadcast<br>
channel BCCH.<br>
[0021]<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, the radio base station eNB includes<br>
an emergency information receiver unit 11 and an emergency<br>
information transmitter unit 12.<br>
[0022]<br>
The emergency information receiver unit 11 is configured<br>
to receive emergency information transmitted by an emergency<br>
information notification system, in other words, to detect<br>
occurrence of emergency information.<br>
[0023]<br>
The emergency information transmitter unit 12 is<br>
configured to transmit the emergency information to the<br>
multiple mobile stations UE via the broadcast channel BCCH.<br>
[0024]<br>
Specifically, the emergency.information transmitter unit<br>
12 is configured to notify the multiple mobile stations UE of<br>
a predetermined trigger, and to start transmitting<br>
scheduling-information-notification system information<br>
(MIB/SIB1) to the multiple mobile stations UE at the current<br>
modification period MP(n) without waiting until the next<br>
modification period MP(n+l) starts, when the emergency<br>
information receiver unit 11 receives emergency information,<br>
in other words, when the emergency information receiver unit<br>
11 detects occurrence of emergency information. The<br>
scheduling-information-notification system information is<br>
 <br>
used for notification of scheduling information which specifies<br>
a downlink resource for transmitting<br>
emergency-information-notification system information (e.g.,<br>
SIB9).<br>
[0025]<br>
The emergency information transmitter unit 12 is also<br>
configured to transmit the emergency-information-notification<br>
system information (e.g., SIB9) by using the downlink resource<br>
specified by the scheduling information.<br>
[0026]<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, each of the mobile stations UE includes<br>
an emergency information receiver unit 21 and a processor unit<br>
22.<br>
[0027]<br>
The emergency information receiver unit 21 is configured<br>
to receive emergency information transmitted by the radio base<br>
station eNB via the broadcast channel BCCH.<br>
[0028]<br>
Specifically, as shown in Fig. 4, the emergency <br>
information receiver unit 21 is configured to start receiving<br>
the scheduling-information-notification system information<br>
(MIB/SIB1) at the current modification period MP(n) without<br>
waiting until the next modification period MP (n+1) starts, when<br>
detecting the predetermined trigger.<br>
[0029]<br>
The emergency information receiver unit 21 is also<br>
configured to receive the emergency-information-notification<br>
system information (e.g., SIB9) on the basis of the scheduling<br>
information notified by the received<br>
 <br>
scheduling-information-notification system information<br>
(MIB/SIB1).<br>
[0030]<br>
It should be noted in this case that the emergency-<br>
information receiver unit 21 may be configured not to receive<br>
scheduling information (SIB2 to SIB8) except the<br>
emergency-information-notification system information (e.g.,<br>
SIB9).<br>
[0031]<br>
Here, the emergency information receiver unit 21 may be<br>
configured to start receiving the<br>
scheduling-information-notification system information<br>
(MIB/SIB1) at the current modification period MP(n) without<br>
waiting until the next modification period MP (n+1) starts, when<br>
the mobile station UE is in an idle state or a communicating<br>
state, and when the emergency information receiver unit 21<br>
detects a predetermined indicator (ETWS/PWS indicator)<br>
included in a paging message as the predetermined trigger.<br>
[0032]<br>
As shown in Fig. 5, the paging message is transmitted via<br>
a PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) corresponding to a<br>
P-RNTI via a PDCCH (Physical Downlink Control Channel) .<br>
[0033]<br>
For example, the predetermined indicator (ETWS/PWS<br>
indicator) is a 1-bit indicator used for notification of the<br>
presence or absence of emergency information, or is primary<br>
notification (which is short information to be notified of first<br>
as to the emergency information and is used to ring mobile<br>
stations or the like).<br>
 <br>
[0034]<br>
In other words, the emergency information transmitter<br>
unit 12 of the radio base station eNB may be configured to<br>
transmit, as the predetermined trigger, the predetermined<br>
indicator (ETWS/PWS indicator) in a paging message, to the<br>
mobile stations UE in an idle state or a radio-link established<br>
state (RRC_connected state).<br>
[0035]<br>
In addition, the emergency information receiver unit 21<br>
may also be configured to start receiving the<br>
scheduling-information-notification system information<br>
(MIB/SIB1) at the current modification period MP(n) without<br>
waiting until the next modification period MP (n+1) starts', when<br>
the mobile station UE is in an idle state or a communicating<br>
state, and when the emergency information receiver unit 21<br>
detects a predetermined indicator (ETWS/PWS indicator) as the<br>
predetermined trigger via a PDCCH (Physical Downlink Control<br>
Channel) including a P-RNTI (Paging-RNTI) as shown in Fig. 6.<br>
[0036]<br>
For example, the predetermined indicator (ETWS/PWS<br>
indicator) is a 1-bit indicator used for notification of the<br>
presence or absence of emergency information, or is primary<br>
notification (which is short information to be notified of first<br>
as to the emergency information and is used to ring mobile<br>
stations).<br>
[0037]<br>
In other words, the emergency information transmitter<br>
unit 12 of the radio base station eNB may be configured to<br>
transmit, as the predetermined trigger, the predetermined<br>
 <br>
indicator (ETWS/PWS indicator) via the PDCCH (Physical Downlink<br>
Control Channel) including the P-RNTI (Paging-RNTI), to mobile<br>
stations UE in an idle state or a radio-link established state<br>
(RRC_connected state).<br>
[0038]<br>
Additionally, the emergency information receiver unit 21<br>
may also be configured to start receiving the<br>
scheduling-information-notification system information<br>
(MIB/SIB1) at the current modification period MP(n) without<br>
waiting until the next modification period MP (n+1) starts, when<br>
the mobile station UE is in a radio-link established state<br>
(RRC_connected state) or an idle state, and when the emergency<br>
information receiver unit 21 detects a predetermined indicator<br>
(ETWS/PWS indicator) as the predetermined trigger via a PDCCH<br>
(Physical Downlink Control Channel) including an SC-RNTI<br>
(System Change-RNTI, i.e., predetermined identifier) as shown<br>
in Fig. 7.<br>
[0039]<br>
For example, the predetermined indicator (ETWS/PWS<br>
indicator) is a 1-bit indicator used for notification of the<br>
presence or absence of emergency information, or is primary<br>
notification (which is short information to be notified of first<br>
as to the emergency information and is used to ring mobile<br>
stations or the like).<br>
[0040]<br>
In other words, the emergency information transmitter<br>
unit 12 of the radio base station eNB may be configured to<br>
transmit, as the predetermined trigger, the predetermined<br>
indicator (ETWS/PWS indicator) via the PDCCH (Physical Downlink<br>
 <br>
Control Channel) including the SC-RNTI (System Change-RNTI,<br>
i.e., predetermined identifier), to mobile stations UE in an<br>
idle state or a radio-link established state (RRC connected<br>
state) .<br>
[0041]<br>
In addition, the emergency information receiver unit 21<br>
may also be configured to start receiving the<br>
scheduling-information-notification system information<br>
(MIB/SIB1) at the current modification period MP(n) without<br>
waiting until the next modification periodMP (n+1) starts, when<br>
detecting a PDCCH (Physical Downlink Control Channel) including<br>
an ETWS/PWS-RNTI (predetermined identifier) as the<br>
predetermined trigger as shown in Fig. 8.<br>
[0042]<br>
In other words, the emergency information transmitter<br>
unit 12 of the radio base station eNB may be configured to<br>
transmit, as the predetermined trigger, predetermined<br>
information via the PDCCH (Physical Downlink Control Channel)<br>
including the ETWS/PWS-RNTI (predetermined identifier).<br>
[0043]<br>
The processor unit 22 is configured to perform processing<br>
corresponding to the emergency information notified by the<br>
received emergency-information-notification system<br>
information (e.g., SIB9).<br>
[0044]<br>
For example, as the processing corresponding to the<br>
emergency information, the processor unit 22 may output an alarm<br>
corresponding to the emergency information, or show textual<br>
information or image information corresponding to the emergency<br>
 <br>
information, on a display.<br>
[0045]<br>
(Operation of Mobile Communication System according to First<br>
Embodiment of Present Invention)<br>
With reference to Fig. 9, operation of the mobile station<br>
according the first embodiment of the present invention will<br>
be described.<br>
[0046]<br>
As shown in Fig. 9, in Step S101, the mobile station UE<br>
detects a PDCCH including an ETWS/PWS-RNTI, or an ETWS/PWS<br>
indicator.<br>
[0047]<br>
In Step S102, the mobile station UE starts receiving the<br>
MIB/SIB9 at the current modification period MP(n) without<br>
waiting until the next modification period MP(n+l) starts.<br>
[0048]<br>
In Step S103, the mobile station UE receives the SIB9 on<br>
the basis of scheduling information notified by the received<br>
MIB/SIB1,and then performs processing (e.g., using an alarm,<br>
display, or the like) corresponding to emergency information<br>
notified by the SIB9.<br>
[0049]<br>
(Advantageous Effect of Mobile Communication System according<br>
to First Embodiment of Present Invention)<br>
With the mobile communication system according to the<br>
first embodiment of the present invention, when detecting a<br>
predetermined trigger, a mobile station UE starts receiving the<br>
MIB/SIB1 at the current modification period MP(n) without<br>
waiting until the next modification period MP (n+1) starts, and<br>
 <br>
then receives the SIB9 for notification of emergency<br>
information, on the basis of the MIB/SIB1. Accordingly,<br>
multiple mobile stations UE can be notified of generated<br>
emergency information as quickly as possible.<br>
[0050]<br>
(Modification)<br>
With reference to Figs. 10 to 12, the mobile communication<br>
system according to Modification 1 of the present invention will<br>
be described while attention is focused on the difference from<br>
the mobile communication system according to the first<br>
embodiment described above.<br>
