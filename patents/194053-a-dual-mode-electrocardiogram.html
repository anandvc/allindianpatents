BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Telemedicine Is a term used to describe a type of medica! service involving monitoring of a patient's condition by a healthcare worker located at a healthcare facility, vjhich is remote wijh respect to the location of the patient. Telemedicine is capable of providing enormous benefits to society by bridging the gap between the availability of the medical service by competent medical personnel as we!! as the acute need for the medical service in rural and remote areas.<br>
India with majority of the population living in rural and remote areas do not have proper access to medical facilities and interpretation of biosignals acquired during medical processes by competent medical personnel. A timely intervention by medical personnel in the process could be very helpful in delivering appropriate medical care saving lives in many cases.<br>
in the event of non-availability of competent medical services in the remote, rural and semi-urban areas, the needy are required -to travel long distances, spend valuable time and money in getting access to proper medical services. The situation could assume very difficult propositions when there are medical emergencies which need to be attended to immediately.<br>
The current telemedicine models being employed in the country do not provide relief to the needy by analyzing and Interpreting their biosignals and providing follow-up action wherever needed. Hence, the current technology platform is Invented which takes into account the available telecommunication infrastructure in the country and readily available information technology products and medical devices for processing of biosignals on-line and real time mode.<br>
Even in many semi-urban areas there are not adequate medical personnel to take care of medical emergencies and there is no available technology currently to take care of monitoring of biosignals or vital signs on-line, real time within easily available telecommunication Infrastructure. Technology gaps do exist within the country for monitoring of patients vital signs while they are mobile and also for monitoring of biosignals and vital signs when the medical personnel are mobile.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION :<br>
The present invention provides methods of acquiring, transmitting, receiving, viewing, fonwarding, reporting, storing and retrieving all types of biosignals and vital signs in on-line and real time mode. These can be acquired and transmitted either in a stationery status or in a mobile status for further processing and follow-up action. The signals are acquired either on a Desktop computer. Laptop computer etc., and, they are either sent in their native form or compressed and transmitted either to a stand-alone device or a central server.<br>
The biosignals and vital signs are sent either through a plain telephone line, GSM Mobile, GPRS Mobile, ISDN, Leased Line, VSAT and using WWW.<br><br>
Using the technology platform provided in the present invention, the biosignals and vital signs are sent from one remote location to another remote location (or) from one to many (or) from many to one (or) many to many modes for interpretation and follow-up action.<br>
The technology plaform is interactive in nature and provides for the remote interpreters to monitor the biosignals either locally from a server or from a remote site themselves; transmit the same on to www and to discuss the same interactively with many interpreters.<br>
The platform also provides for interpreter defined monitoring of vital signs or biosignals, provides for interactive video, text chat, voice and data in the form of essential medical data to aid the interpreters in their analysis of biosignals as well as follow-up action.<br>

FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to the field of medical technology and more particularly relates to the Electro Cardiogram monitoring.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
An Electro Cardiogram Machine is used for recording the Electro Cardiogram signals of a patient during resting phase using a resting Electro Cardiogram and during activity phase using a stress Electro Cardiogram machine. These tests are conducted with specific time duration only. However, during emergencies when patients are admitted, they are monitored using an Electro Cardiogram Monitor which continuously monitors the Electro Cardiogram signals of the patient with alarms being provided to have timely medical intervention when the patient's physiological signs breach the limits set by the attending physicians.<br>
In emergency cases the usual practice is to take a 12 lead Electro Cardiogram first for diagnosing the problem and then the patient is connected to cardiac monitor. And also it is necessary to take periodic resting Electro Cardiograms of the patients in addition to doing the monitoring of his Electro Cardiogram signals. Normally, 2 different equipment are used for this purpose - one for the resting Electro Cardiogram (a complete 12 lead Electro Cardiogram taken on a patient during resting phase for a specific time duration) and the other for Electro Cardiogram Monitoring (The Eiectro Cardiogram is displayed and read on a continuous basis and will capture the signals as the patient is connected to the machine). An integrated Resting Electro Cardiogram-cum-Electro Cardiogram Monitor would be of great importance in "saving the time to treatment during critical moments" as both the applications will be available in the same system.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention provides a unique 2-in-1 Resting Electro Cardiogram Machine and an Electro Cardiogram Monitor in the same medical device that allows switching between a Resting Electro Cardiogram machine and an Electro Cardiogram monitor by a software switch. The medical devices are connected to the computer in which the Resting Electro Cardiogram, Electro Cardiogram Monitor software operate in Windows environment.<br>
Cardiac monitors produced in India do not have the in built case sheet that can be transmitted to a remote location for specialist review &amp; opinion. The monitors do not have the capability of transmitting to a remote location using low bandwidth technology like plain telephone line.<br>
But, it would also be highly desirable to have the electronic case sheet of the patient integrated with the Electro Cardiogram signals for display on the monitor for review by the attending doctor. There will be enormous value addition to the system if the Electro Cardiogram signals as weil as the Electronic case sheet of the patient along with resting Electro Cardiogram could be transmitted on-line in real-time using available low bandwidth telephone technology to a specialist doctor for further reference. This would give the advantage of remote monitoring of the patient condition for enabling appropriate treatment under the guidance of the specialist doctor anywhere anytime, especially whenever such specialist facility is not available locally. This gives the much-needed real-time telemedicine application for a country like India where majority of the population lives in the rural areas.<br>
Dual use Electro Cardiogram with its transmitting capability is a type of real-time telemedicine application providing enormous benefits to society by bridging the gap between the availability of the medical service by competent medical personnel as well as the acute need for the medical service in rural and remote areas.<br>
Appropriate treatment for emergency case patients will be available anywhere, anytime &amp; can be affordable with the above invention.<br><br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Accordingly, it is the object of the invention to provide an improved system of Electro Cardiogram monitoring.<br>
It is an additional object of the invention to provide a unique 2-jn-1 Resting Electro Cardiogram Machine and an Electro Cardiogram Monitor in the same medical device<br>
