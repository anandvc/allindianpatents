MODULAR JACK ASSEMBLY<br>
Field of the Invention:<br>
This invention generally relates to the art of electrical connectors and, particularly, to<br>
a modular jack assembly for use in telecommunications equipment.<br>
Background of the Invention:<br>
Modular jack assemblies are used in telecommunications equipment for mating with<br>
telephone-type modular plugs to transmit electrical signals therethrough. A typical modular<br>
jack assembly includes a dielectric housing having a receptacle for receiving the modular<br>
plug. A plurality of conductive terminals are mounted in the housing, with contact arms<br>
cantilevered into the receptacle. A conventional modular jack assembly includes at least<br>
eight terminals for engaging eight contacts of the modular plug. A simple eight-terminal<br>
modular jack assembly which mates with an eight wire plug is quite reliable and creates few<br>
problems.<br>
However, some modular plugs contain only four or six wires, but the four or six wire<br>
plugs still are inserted into an eight-wire jack assembly. When this occurs, the outside<br>
terminals in an eight-terminal array in the jack assembly are prone to become damaged. This<br>
is due to the plastic ends of the plugs outside the four or six wire array contacting some of the<br>
jack terminals. The plastic ends cause the terminals to deflect excessively, resulting in a large<br>
rotating movement where the terminals are fixed to the jack housing. This large rotational<br>
movement causes the terminals to take a permanent set, and those damaged terminals no<br>
longer can apply sufficient pressure to the outside wires of a full eight wire modular plug.<br>
In addition, with the ever-increasing speed of data transmission, the reduction or elimination<br>
of crosstalk has become important for electrical connectors including modular jack<br>
assemblies. Crosstalk is a phenomena that occurs when a part of the electromagnetic energy<br>
transmitted through one of a plurality of conductors in a connector causes electrical currents<br>
in the other conductor or conductors. Various systems have been designed to prevent this<br>
crosstalk, such as passing the signals through over-line plates or through traces on a printed<br>
circuit board which create a capacitive connection. Heretofore, modular jack terminals have<br>
been provided with capacitive plates which were insert molded in the jack housing to<br><br>
WO 2004/112201	PCT/US2004/017811<br>
capital investment.<br>
Still other problems are encountered simply in mounting the tiny modular jack<br>
terminals in the very small jack housing. As stated, insert molding is quite expensive for an<br>
otherwise simple and inexpensive electrical connector. Mechanically inserting the terminals<br>
into the jack housing often results in damage to the tiny and very fragile terminals.<br>
The present invention is directed to solving this myriad of problems, including the provision<br>
of an unproved system for mounting the terminals in the assembly as well as providing a<br>
capacitive relationship between the terminals.<br>
Summary of the Invention:<br>
An object, therefore, of the invention is to provide a new and improved modular jack<br>
assembly of the character described.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment of the invention, the modular jack assembly includes a<br>
housing having a plug-receiving receptacle. A terminal module is disposed in the housing<br>
and includes a dielectric body mounting a plurality of terminals, with contact portions of the<br>
terminals cantilevered from the body into the receptacle. The dielectric body includes a pair<br>
of body halves having opposing abutting faces. The terminals have mounting portions<br>
embedded in the opposing faces of the body halves. The terminals are securely captured in<br>
the dielectric body when the mounting portions of the terminals are sandwiched between the<br>
body halves.<br>
According to one aspect of the invention, the opposing abutting faces of the body<br>
halves include a plurality of recesses for receiving the mounting portions of at least some of<br>
the terminals. The mounting portions are press-fit into said recesses. The body halves,<br>
themselves, have interengaging means for press-fitting the body halves together.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, the mounting portion of at least one of<br>
the terminals in the opposing abutting face of one of the body halves overlaps the mounting<br>
portion of one of the terminals in the opposing abutting face of the other body half to create a<br>
capacitance arrangement. The overlapping mounting portions may be generally flat plate<br>
portions of the terminals. In the preferred embodiment, a dielectric sheet is disposed between<br>
overlapping mounting portions of the terminals.<br>

WO 2004/112201	PCT/US2004/017811<br>
Referring to the drawings in greater detail, and first to FIGS. 1 and 2, the invention is<br>
embodied in a modular jack assembly ("modular jack"), generally designated 10. The<br>
modular jack includes a dielectric housing means, generally designated 12 (Fig. 1), which is a<br>
two-pait housing means provided by a front housing part 14 and a rear housing part 16. A<br>
terminal module, generally designated 18 in FIG. 5 and described in greater detail hereinafter,<br>
is mounted within the modular jack between front and rear housing parts 14 and 16,<br>
respectively. As viewed in FIG. 2 and described hereinafter, the terminal module includes a<br>
pair of body halves 20 and 22 which sandwich a plurality of terminals, generally designated<br>
24, therebetween. As seen in FIG. 2, the terminals are mounted in a linear array. The<br>
terminals are inserted into a printed circuit board 25 having circuit traces which help to<br>
minimize crosstalk. A plurality of insulation-displacement terminals 25A are terminated to<br>
the circuit traces and project rearwardly from printed circuit board 25.<br>
Front housing part 14 of housing means 12 includes a typically configured receptacle<br>
26 for receiving a modular plug as is known in the telecommunications industry. The front<br>
housing part is constructed for mounting in a panel, circuit board or other substrate, with a<br>
flange 28 on each opposite side of the front housing part for engaging a back side of the<br>
panel. A flexible latch arm 30 includes a latch hook 30a for snappingly engaging the front<br>
side of the panel. The front housing part includes a latch opening 32 in each opposite side<br>
thereof.<br>
Rear housing part 16 includes a cavity 34 for substantially receiving terminal module<br>
18 with terminals 24 cantilevered forwardly into receptacle 26 of the first housing part<br>
whereby the terminals can engage the contacts of the mating modular plug. A pair of<br>
chamfered latch bosses 36 project outwardly from opposite sides of the rear housing part for<br>
engaging within openings 32 and latching the front and rear housing parts together<br>
surrounding the terminal module. Both housing parts may be fabricated of molded plastic<br>
material, whereby chamfered latch bosses 36 "snap" into latching engagement with latch<br>
openings 32 when the housing parts are assembled in the direction of arrow "A" (Fig. 2). A<br>
cover 38 closes the rear end of rear housing part 16. The cover includes a pair of inwardly<br>
facing chamfered latch bosses 40 for latching engagement in a pair of latch openings 42 in<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2004/112201	PCT/US2004/017811<br>
tennination to insulation displacement terminals 25 A.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 3-5, terminal module 18 includes a terminal module body,<br>
generally designated 44 (Fig. 5), which inciuaos the aforementioned body halves 20 and 22.<br>
The "housing means" of modular jack assembly 10 includes terminal module body 44 (body<br>
halves 20 and 22) as well as front and rear housing parts 14 and 16, respectively. FIG. 5<br>
shows the body halves secured together. FIG. 3 shows that each body halve has a securing<br>
post 46 which is press-fit into a securing hole 48 in the other body half. Body halves 20 and<br>
22 have opposing abutting faces 20a and 22a, respectively, which abut each other at an<br>
interface 50 (Fig. 5) when the body halves are assembled. Each opposing abutting face of<br>
each body half includes a plurality of recesses 52 within which terminals 24 are press-fit<br>
before the body halves are press-fit together. Therefore, it can be seen that the entire terminal<br>
module is extremely simple and extremely efficient to manufacture and assembly by a simple<br>
press-fit concept.<br>
To that end, FIG. 6 shows terminal module 18 mounted within cavity 34 in rear<br>
housing part 16. The cavity conforms to the outer peripheral dimensions of the terminal<br>
module, including the assembled body halves 20 and 22, so that the body halves cannot<br>
separate, thereby securely sandwiching terminals 24 between the body halves and securely<br>
mounting the terminals within rear housing part 16.<br>
Both body halves 20 and 22 of terminal module 18 are molded of plastic material.<br>
For purposes described hereinafter, body half 20 is molded with a support block 54 projecting<br>
therefrom and defining a generally planar wall 56 which extends generally parallel to the<br>
linear array of terminals 24, for purposes described hereinafter.<br>
Referring back to FIG. 4, a dielectric sheet 58 is adhered to face 20a of body half 20<br>
covering the terminals. This dielectric sheet is effective to ensure that any portion of the<br>
terminals in one body half do not engage any portions of the terminals in the other body half<br>
when the body halves are press-fit together, As will be seen hereinafter, certain portions of<br>
the terminals overlap to create capacitive arrangements, and dielectric sheet 58 prevents<br>
engagement between the overlapping terminal portions. Of course, dielectric sheet 58 could<br>
be adhered to face 22a of body half 22 as well as or in the alternative to adhering the sheet to<br>
face 20a of body half 20.<br>
5<br><br>
WO 2004/112201	PCT/US2004/017811<br>
and 6. Actually, the terminals would never exist in this isolated depiction as well as in the<br>
depiction of FIG. 2, because the terminals are mounted within terminal module 18 between<br>
body halves 20 and 22 of the module. The depiction of FIG. 7 is to enable a clear description<br>
of the configurations of the terminals, below.<br>
With that understanding, terminals 24 have been identified as individual terminals<br>
24a-24h in sequence, from one end of the linear array of terminals to the opposite end. All of<br>
the terminals are stamped and formed of conductive sheet metal material and have tail<br>
portions 60 for insertion into printed circuit board 25 (Fig. 2). All of the terminals have<br>
enlarged or irregular body portions forming mounting portions 62 which are press-fit into<br>
recesses 52 in body halves 20 and 22 as seen in FIG. 3. The mounting portions of terminals<br>
24 and 24b overlap. The mounting portions of terminals 24c and 24d overlap. The mounting<br>
portions of terminals 24e and 24f overlap. The mounting portions of terminals 24g and 24h<br>
overlap. These overlapping portions of the terminals create capacitive arrangements to<br>
reduce or eliminate crosstalk within the modular jack assembly. Dielectric sheet 58 (Fig. 4) is<br>
disposed between these overlapping portions of the terminals to prevent engagement<br>
therebetween.<br>
The four inside terminals 24c-24f are provided with contact portions 64, and the four<br>
outside terminals 24a, 24b, 24g and 24h are provided with contact portions 66. All of the<br>
contact portions are provided for engaging contacts of a modular jack plug inserted into<br>
receptacle 26 (Fig. 1) of the modular jack assembly. The contact portions are bent out of<br>
contact arms 68 of the terminals, with the contact arms being cantilevered into receptacle 26.<br>
It can be seen in FIG. 7 that two pairs of terminals 24a/24b and 24g/24h are disposed<br>
outside the four inner terminals 24c-24f. The outside terminals have different configurations<br>
and include engaging portions 70 which are bowed to define convex surfaces 70a. Contact<br>
portions 66 of contact arms 68 of the outside terminals also are bowed, but in the opposite<br>
direction of bowed engaging portions 70, to define convex contact surfaces for engaging the<br>
contacts of the modular plug. In addition, the contact portion of each contact arm of each<br>
outside terminal is bent back onto itself, as at 72, to define a convex surface 72a at a back<br>
side of the contact arm. In other words, the convex surfaces defined by contact portions 66<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2004/112201	PCT/US2004/017811<br>
convex surfaces 72a are located at an opposite or back side of the contact arms.<br>
FIG. 8 shows a typical modular jack plug, generally designated 76. The plug includes<br>
a dielectric housing 78 mounting a plurality of terminals which have contacts 80 exposed<br>
within a plurality of troughs 82 at one side 78a of the housing. The plug is inserted into<br>
receptacle 26 (Fig. 1) in modular jack assembly 10, and a flexible latch arm 84 on the plug<br>
latchingly engages with front housing part 14 inside the receptacle, as is known in the art.<br>
FIG. 9A shows plug 76 about to be inserted into receptacle 26 of modular jack assembly 10 in<br>
the direction of arrow "B". One of the outside terminals 24a, 24b, 24g, 24h is shown in this<br>
depiction. It can be seen that wall 56 of terminal module body half 20 (which forms part of<br>
the overall housing means of jack assembly 10) projects forwardly from an interior mating<br>
face 90 of the jack housing means. In addition, a second interior wall 92 of front housing part<br>
14 also projects generally parallel with first wall 56, generally perpendicular to interior<br>
mounting face 90. It can be seen that the convex surface of bowed engaging portion 70 of the<br>
terminal opposes first wall 56, and convex surface 72a of the bent-back portion 72 of the<br>
terminal opposes second wall 92.<br>
FIG. 9B shows plug 76 inserted into receptacle 26 with one of the contacts 80 on the<br>
plug engaging contact portion 66 of the terminal. This causes the terminal to flex only a<br>
sufficient amount to establish a positive electrical connection between the terminal and<br>
contact 80 of the plug. The depiction of FIG. 9B represents a situation where plug 76 is an<br>
eight-wire plug. In other words, contacts 80 (Fig. 8) would be disposed in troughs 82<br>
substantially along the entire width of side 78a of the front of the plug, so that all eight<br>
contacts will engage the eight terminals 24a-24h of the jack assembly.<br>
Now, referring back to FIG. 8, it can be seen that modular plug 76 is a four-wire plug,<br>
resulting in only four contacts 80 disposed within four troughs 82. This creates rather sizable<br>
plastic corners or shoulders 94 at the front mating face of the modular plug.<br>
FIG. 9C shows the situation where the four-wire modular plug 76 of FIG. 8 is inserted<br>
into receptacle 26 of modular jack assembly 10. It can be seen that plastic corners 94 of the<br>
plug will engage and considerably flex the outside terminals. In order to prevent overflexing<br>
of the terminals which might result in establishing permanent sets in the terminals, it can be<br>
seen that bowed engaging portion 70 (compare to FIGS. 9A and 9B) has engaged first wall 56<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2004/112201	PCT/US2004/017811<br>
contact portion 66 engages comer 94 of housing 78 of piug 76. These counteracting forces on<br>
the terminal tend to straighten the terminal out as can be seen in comparing FIG. 9C with<br>
FIG. 9B, rather than bending or flexing the terminal excessively which could damage the<br>
terminal or create a permanent set in the terminal.<br>
Although the function of the outside terminals were described above in relation lo<br>
FIG. 9C, in regard to a four-wire modular plug 76 shown in FIG. 8, the same result would<br>
occur during mating of a six-wire modular plug. The only difference is that only the outer-<br>
most tenninais 24a and 24h would engage the plastic comer 94 of the plug when mating with<br>
the six-wire plug.<br>
It will be understood that the invention may be embodied in other specific forms<br>
without departing from the spirit or central characteristics thereof. The present examples and<br>
embodiments, therefore, are to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive,<br>
and the invention is not to be limited to the details given herein.<br>
