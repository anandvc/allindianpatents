WEIGHING DEVICE, IN PARTICULAR, MULTIPLE-TRACK WEIGHING DEVICE<br>
The invention relates to a weighing device with several weighing cells, allowing<br>
simultaneous weighing processes to be carried out. Such multiple-track weighing devices are<br>
used, for example, in the pharmaceutical industry, and they are configured to weigh products of<br>
small weight, particularly tablets, coated tablets, and similar items at a high cycle rate.<br>
To keep the number of weighing processes per hour as high as possible, a low-pass filter<br>
with a relatively low limit frequency cannot be applied to the measurement signal with such<br>
weighing devices. Although such low-pass filters would improve the accuracy of the weighing<br>
process, and in particular, would allow the accuracy required in the pharmaceutical industry in<br>
the first place, the result would not be achievable.<br>
Therefore, rather than use low-pass filters with very low limit frequency in such multiple-<br>
track weighing devices, it is commonly known to instead correct the output signal of the force<br>
sensor itself of the weighing cell by the detection of disturbing accelerations, and to compensate<br>
in this way for the influence of disturbing accelerations.<br>
Such compensation methods are known, for example, from DE 32 30 998 Al for scales<br>
with a single weighing cell. In this weighing device, an acceleration sencer is arranged in the<br>
housing of the weighing cell in the immediate vicinity of the moving measurement mechanisms.<br>
With this acceleration sensor, substantially the same disturbing accelerations are detected that<br>
also act on the load and the mass of the measurement mechanisms. The sensor signal is then<br>
amplified to adapt the sensor sensitivity to the sensitivity of the weighing cell, and it is<br>
subtracted from the signal of the weighing cell. In this way, a measurement signal is obtained<br>
which is corrected by the detected disturbing acceleration, and which ideally depends only on the<br>
mass of the load to be weighed. The acceleration sensor is arranged here in such a way that it<br>
detects the components of disturbing accelerations that act in the load insertion direction.<br>
From DE 40 01 614 Al a compensation scale is known in which at least one acceleration<br>
sensor is arranged on a mobile part of the scale. The acceleration sensor delivers a signal to an<br>
arrangement which processes a correction signal, and which determines at least one correction<br>
signal for influencing the measurement result which appears at the output as a measure of weight<br>
or of the mass of the load acting on the mobile part. This state of the art also describes the<br>
compensation and elimination, respectively, of the influence of translational and rotational<br>
disturbing accelerations that act on the base plate of the scale.<br><br>
2<br>
However, the use of such weighing cells, with in each case one or more measurement<br>
recorders, to construct a multiple-track weighing system would be associated with high costs as a<br>
result of the corresponding high number of acceleration sensors.<br>
Therefore, in the construction of multiple-track weighing systems, an appropriate number<br>
of weighing cells is arranged on a common base plate, and a single acceleration sensor is<br>
arranged on this base plate. The position of the acceleration sensor is chosen here such that it is<br>
as characteristic as possible for the disturbing accelerations that can usually be expected, i.e., in<br>
such a way that it is possible to use the signal of the single acceleration sensor to correct with<br>
sufficient accuracy the measurement signals of the individual weighing cells, which signals have<br>
been affected by the disturbing accelerations that have occurred.<br>
However, such multiple-track weighing systems have the disadvantage that in the case<br>
where the disturbing accelerations do not affect the individual weighing cells in the same way, a<br>
sufficiently exact compensation of the disturbing accelerations is not possible, and in some<br>
circumstances an unacceptable error is applied to the generated, corrected weight signals of the<br>
individual weighing cells.<br>
Therefore, the invention is based on the problem of producing a weighing device with<br>
several weighing cells that are mechanically rigidly interconnected, where the weight signals of<br>
the individual weighing cells can be corrected with sufficient accuracy even if disturbing<br>
accelerations occur that do not affect all the weighing cells in the same way, and where the<br>
device has a simple and cost effective construction.<br>
The invention solves this problem with the characteristics of Claim 1.<br>
The invention is based on the finding that a sufficiently exact compensation of disturbing<br>
accelerations is enabled by using at least one acceleration sensor that detects at least one<br>
acceleration disturbance, if in addition in each case a correcting quantity which takes into<br>
account the influence of the detected acceleration disturbance is determined, using a<br>
predetermined rule for each weighing cell, from the disturbing quantity signaLof the at least one<br>
acceleration sensor as a function of the geometric location of the relevant weighing cell relative<br>
to the geometric location of the at least one acceleration sensor. Using this correcting quantity,<br>
which is determined for each individual weighing cell, the weight signal of the relevant weighing<br>
cell, to which the influence of the disturbing acceleration has been applied, can then be corrected.<br>
For this purpose, the correcting quantity can be combined or connected by means of circuit<br>
technology, for example, analog circuit technology, with the measurement signal of the force<br>
measuring device itself of the weighing cell. However, it is naturally also possible to use a purely<br>
computational correction of the weight signal by means of an appropriately configured<br>
evaluating unit. The latter can receive the digitized signal of the acceleration sensor and of the<br>
force sensor.<br><br>
3<br>
The acceleration sensor can be connected rigidly with the weighing cells, which are<br>
rigidly interconnected. This arrangement ensures that although the disturbing accelerations that<br>
occur may affect the individual weighing cells differently, the occurrence of oscillations within<br>
the system of the weighing cells and of the acceleration sensor(s) is avoided. Indeed, in the latter<br>
case it would be impossible to reach a conclusion with sufficient reliability regarding the effect<br>
of this acceleration disturbance at the locations of the weighing cells, and thus on the weighing<br>
cells themselves, by means of detection of the at least one acceleration disturbance.<br>
In principle, however, it is conceivable to provide the moving measurement mechanism<br>
of one or more weighing cells also with the at least one acceleration sensor or at least one of the<br>
acceleration sensors. In this way, the influence of acceleration disturbances on the load side of<br>
the relevant weighing cell can be detected. From this detected acceleration disturbance, it is then<br>
also possible to derive the effect of the detected acceleration disturbance on the other weighing<br>
cells in each case as a function of the geometric data and the characteristic data of the individual<br>
cells.<br>
A weighing device according to the invention can be produced, for example, in a simple<br>
way by connecting all the weighing cells, and preferably also the at least one acceleration sensor,<br>
mechanically rigidly with a support element, for example, by arranging them on a common rigid<br>
base plate.<br>
As is usually done, it is preferred to arrange the weighing cells in such a way that the load<br>
insertion directions or action directions of the weighing cells are substantially parallel.<br>
According to the preferred embodiment of the invention, the number and type of<br>
acceleration sensors is fixed such that it is possible to detect and/or determine both the<br>
component of a purely translational acceleration disturbance that exists in the load insertion<br>
direction of each weighing cell, and also those components of rotational acceleration<br>
disturbances that exist in the load insertion direction and are generated by a single- or multiple-<br>
axis rotational disturbing movement of the weighing cell.<br>
In this case, the evaluating unit is preferably configured so that, using a predetermined<br>
rule for each weighing cell, a correcting quantity is determined in each case from the disturbing<br>
quantity signals of the acceleration sensors as a function of the geometric location of the relevant<br>
weighing cell relative to the geometric location of the acceleration sensors, where this correcting<br>
quantity takes into account the influence, operating at the geometric location of the relevant<br>
weighing cell, of the components of the acceleration disturbances in the load insertion direction<br>
of the relevant weighing cell. In this way, the weight signal, which is affected by the disturbing<br>
quantity, of the relevant weighing cell can then be combined with the correcting quantity, or<br>
processed computationally, in such a way that the influence on the weight signal of the<br><br>
4<br>
components of the acceleration disturbances in the load insertion direction of the relevant<br>
weighing cell can be substantially compensated.<br>
According to an additional embodiment of the invention, the number and the type of<br>
acceleration sensors can be established such that, in addition to the acceleration components in<br>
the load insertion direction of each weighing cell, single- or multiple-axis rotational acceleration<br>
disturbances at the location of each weighing cell can be detected and/or determined that affect<br>
the inertial moment(s) of the measurement mechanisms of the weighing cells about<br>
corresponding axes.<br>
If the influence of rotational acceleration disturbances on the inertial moments of the<br>
measurement mechanisms of the weighing cells about corresponding axes is also compensated,<br>
the accuracy of the weighing device is improved further.<br>
In this case, the evaluating unit is preferably configured so that, using a predetermined<br>
rule for each weighing cell, a correcting quantity is determined in each case from the disturbing<br>
quantity signals of the acceleration sensors as a function of the geometric location of the relevant<br>
weighing cell relative to the geometric location of the acceleration sensors, which in addition<br>
takes into account the influence, operating at the geometric location of the relevant weighing<br>
cell, of the single- or multiple-axis rotational acceleration disturbances on the inertial moment(s)<br>
of the measurement mechanisms of the relevant weighing cell. The weight signal of the relevant<br>
weighing cell that is affected by the disturbing quantity can then again be linked, or nrocessed<br>
computationally, with the correcting quantity, so that the influence of the rotational acceleration<br>
disturbances on the weight signal is substantially compensated. Naturally, it is possible to<br>
provide several evaluating units instead of a single evaluating unit, or even one evaluating unit<br>
per weighing cell, with these units performing signal processing, or the single evaluating unit can<br>
be implemented as an evaluating unit with a distributed arrangement.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention that is easy to produce, several weighing<br>
cells can be arranged on a line x connecting two translational acceleration sensors that are<br>
arranged at a certain separation from each other. The expression translational acceleration sensor<br>
here denotes an acceleration sensor whose sensor signal reflects, or is proportional to, the<br>
components of any acceleration disturbances where the components occur in an action direction<br>
or detection direction of the acceleration sensor. On the other hand, a rotational acceleration<br>
sensor detects a purely rotational disturbing acceleration about a predetermined axis (action<br>
direction of the rotational acceleration sensor).<br>
In this simplified embodiment of a weighing device according to the invention, it is<br>
possible to use only two translational acceleration sensors to determine in a simple way by<br>
calculation the influence of acceleration disturbances which have components in the load<br><br>
5<br>
insertion direction of the weighing cells. In many cases, a sufficiently accurate correction of the<br>
weight signals is already achieved with only two translational acceleration sensors.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, it is possible to provide, in<br>
addition to the two translational acceleration sensors on the line on which the weighing cells are<br>
also provided, an additional translational acceleration sensor that is at a predetermined distance<br>
from the connecting line. In this embodiment, it is not absolutely necessary for all the weighing<br>
cells to be on one line with the first two translational acceleration sensors. This is because using<br>
three translational acceleration sensors also enables determining the influence of any acceleration<br>
disturbances having components in the weighing cell load insertion direction at the locations of<br>
the individual weighing cells. However, by placing the weighing cells on a line with two of the<br>
translational acceleration sensors, a simple computational correction of the weight signals can be<br>
achieved.<br>
If the additional translational acceleration sensor is arranged on a central normal line onto<br>
the interval between the first two translational acceleration sensors, then it is also possible to<br>
determine a simple correction of the influence of a single rotational acceleration disturbance,<br>
namely the rotational acceleration disturbance whose axis is parallel to the line on which the<br>
weighing cells are arranged. In principle, however it is naturally possible to use three<br>
translational acceleration sensors to also determine the influence of rotational disturbing<br>
accelerations whose axis is parallel to the plane defined by the three translational acceleration<br>
sensors.<br>
Another simplification of the correction and accuracy improvement can be achieved by<br>
designing and arranging the weighing cells such that the measurement mechanisms have<br>
rotational oscillation sensitivity substantially only about an axis that is parallel to the line on<br>
which the weighing cells are arranged.<br>
In the embodiment with three acceleration sensors, where the weighing cells are located<br>
on the line connecting two of the acceleration sensors, and the third acceleration sensor is located<br>
on the central normal line onto the interval between the two first acceleration sensors, a very<br>
simple computational compensation of the influence of both rotational disturbing accelerations<br>
and also a very simple computational correction of the influence of translational disturbing<br>
acceleration in the load insertion direction of the weighing cells can be achieved.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, one can use as acceleration sensors, in<br>
particular translational acceleration sensors, capacitive acceleration sensors, in which the<br>
deflection of a seismic mass from a starting position is determined by using capacitance and the<br>
seismic mass is reset to the starting position by the generation of an electrostatic force using a<br>
closed loop system, where the resetting force required for this purpose represents a measure of<br>
the detected acceleration.<br><br>
6<br>
The acceleration sensors produce very minimal noise, even at high resolution. In<br>
addition, no phase shift occurs with these sensors even at frequencies much higher than 100 Hz.<br>
Consequently, it is simpler to design filters that adapt the frequency response of the sensor to the<br>
frequency response of the weighing cells, since the frequency response of these sensors is<br>
constant in the range of interest.<br>
Such capacitive acceleration sensors naturally need not be used only in weighing devices<br>
with several weighing cells according to the present invention. In fact, one or more such<br>
capacitive acceleration sensors can also be used for the detection of disturbing accelerations in<br>
weighing devices with a single weighing cell. The sensors here can be connected rigidly to the<br>
weighing cells in known fashion, or they can be provided on a moving element of the<br>
measurement mechanisms of the weighing cell.<br>
Additional embodiments of the invention can be obtained from the dependent claims. The<br>
invention is explained in greater detail below with reference to an embodiment example<br>
represented in the drawing. In the drawing,<br>
Figure 1 shows a schematic representation of a multiple-track weighing device according<br>
to the present invention with two translational acceleration sensors;<br>
Figure 2 shows a schematic block diagram for representing the signal combination with<br>
the correction of the weight signals of the device in Figure 1;<br>
Figure 3 shows a schematic representation of an additional embodiment of a multinle-<br>
track weighing device according to the invention with three acceleration sensors in top view, and<br>
Figure 4 shows a schematic block diagram for representing the combination of the<br>
individual signals for the correction of the weight signals of the multiple-track weighing device<br>
in Figure 3.<br>
The weighing device 1, which is represented diagrammatically in a front view in Figure<br>
1, comprises several weighing cells 3, which are also marked with the abbreviation WZ. The<br>
weighing cells 3 are arranged along a line or straight line on a rigid support plate 5. The<br>
Cartesian coordinate system, which is also represented in Figure 1, was chosen to describe the<br>
geometry of the weighing device 1. In this coordinate system, the line along which the weighing<br>
cells 3 are arranged, preferably at equidistant intervals, runs in the direction of the x axis. The<br>
force insertion direction, along which a load (not shown) in each case exerts weight on a load<br>
sensor 7 of the weighing cell 3, runs in the direction of the z axis of the coordinate system.<br>
To correct influences from acceleration disturbances that have components in the<br>
direction of the z axis of the weighing cells 3, only two translational acceleration recorders or<br>
acceleration sensors 9 are arranged in the weighing device 1 represented in Figure 1. The<br>
acceleration sensors are also provided with the reference numbers BA1 and BA2.<br><br>
7<br>
To compensate for the above-mentioned acceleration disturbances, the acceleration<br>
sensors 9 are arranged on the same line on which the weighing cells 3 are also positioned. In the<br>
represented embodiment example, the acceleration sensors 9 are positioned in each case at one<br>
end of the series of weighing cells 3. As a result of the relatively large separation between the<br>
two acceleration sensors 9, the desired high accuracy is achieved in the computation of the<br>
correction factors, as explained below.<br>
The effect on the signals of the individual weighing cells caused by acceleration<br>
disturbances having z-axis direction components can be taken into account because the geometry<br>
of the weighing device 1 is known. The weight Gk(t), which is usually (in the strict sense<br>
incorrectly) indicated in kilograms, on a weighing cell in position k that is adulterated or<br>
superposed by acceleration components can be described by the equation<br><br>
Here mk stands for the mass of the load, which is located on the load sensor 7 of the weighing<br>
cell in position k, and mvLk takes into account the influence of a preload that is ontionally<br>
mounted on the weighing cell and the unladen masses of the weighing cell mechanism which are<br>
involved in acceleration. The gravitation;  istant (gravitational acceleration) is<br>
denoted as g. <br>
For the geometry of this special arrangement, the anreleration in the z direction<br>
can be calculated from the accelerations  at the two locations XBAI and XRA2<br>
of the two translational acceleration sensors 9, or BA1 and BA2, respectively, using the<br>
following equation:<br><br>
In this equation, the geometric location of the weighing cell in position k is denoted Xwzk-<br>
In this special geometry of the arrangement of all the weighing cells 3 and of the two<br>
translational acceleration sensors 9 on a line, all the components of any acceleration disturbances<br><br>
8<br>
in the load insertion weighing cells can be determined and corrected with only two translational<br>
acceleration sensors.<br>
It should be noted here that a translational acceleration sensor means an acceleration<br>
sensor that can determine the acceleration in a predetermined direction of action. Thus, the<br>
direction of action of the acceleration sensors 9 in the embodiment in Figure 1 is provided as<br>
being in the direction of the z axis of the chosen coordinate system, i.e., parallel to the load<br>
insertion direction of the weighing cells 3.<br>
To compensate for the influence of the acceleration disturbances having components in<br>
the z direction, which is described by the product of the second partial term of the above<br>
equation 1 with the determined disturbing acceleration zv must be subtracted from the weight<br>
signal Gk(t) that is affected by error and is generated by the force sensor itself of each weighing<br>
cell 3. The schematic signal path in question is shown in the block diagram represented in Figure<br>
2. To simplify, only the signal path for the first two weighing cells 3 WZ1 and WZ2 is<br>
represented here.<br>
The two acceleration signals generated by the translational acceleration sensors 3, or BA1<br>
and BA2, respectively, are proportional to the detected disturbing acceleration in the z direction.<br>
For each weighing cell 3, these signals in each case are input to an amplifier VBAI and VBA2,<br>
respectively. Here, the factor which can be seen from equation II is applied in each case to both<br>
signals. At the same time, the sensitivities of the two acceleration sensors BA1 and BA2 are<br>
adapted by means of the amplifiers VBAI and VBA2 to the sensitivity of the weighing cell that<br>
delivers the weight signal Gk(t) which is affected by error. The signals that are present at the<br>
output of each amplifier VBAI and VBA2, and which in each case correspond to a summand of the<br>
above equation II, are added in accordance with this equation. This signal is input to a filter 11<br>
that adapts the frequency responses of the two acceleration sensors to the frequency response of<br>
the weighing cell to ensure a phase-correct combination of these signals. Then, the factor 1/g of a<br>
corresponding multiplier unit is applied to the output signal of the filter 11. However, this<br>
multiplication can naturally also be integrated into the relevant filter 11. The product of the<br>
output signal of the multiplier unit with the mass mvLk is subtracted from the weight signal Gk(t)<br>
that is affected by error. This result is then divided by the output signal of the multiplier unit plus<br>
one. This corrected weight signal Gk,kon-(t) can then be transmitted to a display unit and/or to an<br>
additional data processing unit.<br>
In Figure 3, an additional embodiment of a multiple-track weighing device is represented<br>
that is largely identical to the embodiment according to Figure 1. An additional acceleration<br>
sensor 9 is provided however, which is also denoted BA3.<br>
This embodiment also allows the detection and correction of rotational accelerations of<br>
the support plate 5 and thus of the weighing cells 3. With the three translational acceleration<br><br>
9<br>
sensors, which in each case have a direction of action in the load insertion direction of the<br>
weighing cells 3, it is theoretically possible to detect all the acceleration disturbances that have a<br>
component in the direction of the z axis as well as a two-axis rotational acceleration of the<br>
support plate 5 and thus of the weighing cells 3. The two axes of the rotational acceleration are<br>
here parallel to the plane, or in the plane of the support plate 5, or in the plane in which the<br>
weighing cells 3 are arranged (or in a plane that is perpendicular to the load insertion direction of<br>
the weighing cells 3). Thus, any wobbling motion of the support plate 5 and of the weighing cells<br>
3 arranged on it can be detected.<br>
Below, it is assumed that the weighing cells 3 are constructed such that they are sensitive<br>
only to rotating oscillations or rotational disturbing accelerations about an axis parallel to the x<br>
axis. This is the case, for example, in compensation scales whose lever mechanisms have centers<br>
of rotation for the levers exclusively about axes that are parallel to the x axis. If the weighing<br>
cells 3 are arranged so that the rotation axes of the lever mechanisms run parallel to the x axis,<br>
then a rotational acceleration disturbance that can have a corrupting effect on the measurement<br>
result can only be one which contains at least one component of a rotational disturbing<br>
acceleration about this axis.<br>
For an arrangement of the additional acceleration sensor BA3 on the central normal line<br><br>
This equation corresponds to the above explained equation I, but it has been expanded by<br>
the last partial term to take into account the rotational disturbing acceleration about an axis<br>
parallel to the x axis, where kk denotes the rotational sensitivity of the measurement mechanisms<br>
of the weighing cells in position k about an axis parallel to the x axis, and  denotes the<br>
rotational disturbing acceleration about this axis.<br>
The translational disturbing acceleration   must again be determined according to<br>
the previously explained equation II.<br>
For the geometry chosen in Figure 3, the rotational disturbing acceleration is<br>
obtained from the relation<br><br>
10<br>
In this relation, denote the measurement signals of the<br>
two translational acceleration sensors BA1 and BA2, and of the additional translational<br>
acceleration sensor BA3, respectively, VBAI, YBA2 and VBA3 refer to the geometric locations of the<br>
translational acceleration sensors in a direction perpendicular to the x axis or in the direction of<br>
the y axis.<br>
Naturally, the chosen geometry can also be chosen to be more complicated than shown in<br>
Figure 3. However, this geometry in particular leads to relatively simple relations for those<br>
quantities required for correction of the weight signals affected by error of the measurement cells<br>
3.<br>
In general, however, the present invention is based on the principle, starting from a<br>
preselected number and type of acceleration sensors that are mechanically rigidly connected with<br>
the weighing cells which are also interconnected rigidly, of evaluation of the sensor signals<br>
taking into account the geometry such that the disturbing acceleration of interest in each case, or<br>
its components at the location of each individual weighing cells, is (are) determined and used for<br>
correction of the weight signal affected by error of the relevant weighing cell.<br>
In Figure 4, the signal path for the generation of a corrected weight signal Gk,kon-(t) of the<br>
individual weighing cells 3 is again represented using the signal of the three translational<br>
acceleration sensors BA1, BA2 and BA3 (to simplify, only for the first weighing cell 3 WZ1).<br>
For the generation of the signal corresponding to the translational acceleration in the z<br>
direction, normalized for gravitational acceleration, which is present at the output of the filter 11,<br>
reference is made to the above explanations in connection with Figure 2. The rotational<br>
acceleration according to the above equation IV is determined from the signals of all three<br>
translational acceleration sensors 9, where an amplifier V'BAU V'BA2 and V'BA3 acts on each signal<br>
of these sensors. The amplifiers here adapt the sensitivity of the acceleration sensors to the<br>
sensitivity of the relevant weighing cell 3, and at the same time take into account the factors of<br><br><br>
11<br>
For the generation of a corrected weight signal Gk,kon{t) that corresponds to the mass<br>
mk(t) in equation III, the signal at the output of the filter 13, with the factor kk applied to it, is<br>
subtracted from the erroneous weight signal Gk(t) of the weighing cell at the position 1, as is<br>
apparent from solving equation III for the quantity mk(t). The filter 13 again adjusts the<br>
frequency response of the acceleration sensors BA1, BA2, BA3 to the frequency response of the<br>
relevant weighing cell WZk in position k. If different acceleration sensors are used, this<br>
frequency response adaptation can naturally also be integrated into the respective amplifiers and<br>
carried out separately for each acceleration sensor. In addition, the filter 13 can incorporate the<br>
application of the rotational disturbing acceleration about the x axis with the rotational sensitivity<br>
kk of the weighing cell WZk in position k, which application is achieved in Figure 4 by means of<br>
a separately represented multiplication unit. In addition, the product of the output of the filter 11<br>
with the mass mvuc and the factor 1/g is also subtracted from the signal Gk(t) affected by error.<br>
This result in turn is divided by the output signal of the filter 11, increased by plus one.<br>
To simplify, Figure 4 shows this signal course only for the weighing cell WZ1 in the<br>
position 1. With identical weighing cells, a block with the identical signal course plan can be<br>
used for each weighing cell. With different weighing cells, different parameters may have to be<br>
taken into account, such as different sensitivities of the weighing cells, different frequency<br>
responses, and different rotational sensitivities.<br>
Naturally, it is not necessary to provide a corresponding number of hardware circuits to<br>
implement in each case the signal course, represented in Figure 3 for the weighing cell WZ1,<br>
separately for each weighing cell. Rather, the signals of the acceleration sensors and the<br>
erroneous signals of the weighing cells can also be digitized and transmitted to a central<br>
evaluating unit, which consists substantially of a controller which can also be configured as an<br>
independent computer. The controller can then carry out the required computations from the<br>
rules of the previous equations, which are known to the controller, and deliver the corrected<br>
weight signal in digital form, or again in analog form after digital-analog conversion, which is<br>
represented in Figure 3 for the weighing cell WZ1. Naturally, it is also possible to provide<br>
several evaluating units, which in each case correct the weight signals affected by error of a<br>
group of weighing cells 3.<br><br>
