				<td>INTERLEAVING APPARATUS AND METHOD<br>
FOR A COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention:<br>
The present invention relates generally to a communication system, and in particular, to<br>
an interleaving apparatus and method for a radio communication system. Specifically,<br>
the present invention relates to an interleaving apparatus and method that can be used to<br>
generate interleaving addresses and determine interleaver size such that interleaver<br>
memory efficiency is improved.<br>
Description of the Related Art:<br>
Interleaving, a technique typically used to increase the performance of an error<br>
correction code in a fading channel, is closely associated with decoding of a random<br>
error correction code. Many applications, such as an air interface for International<br>
Mobile Telecommunication-2000(IMT-2000) requires a well established method for<br>
implementing various interleaving techniques. In addition, such technologies further<br>
serve to improve the reliability of digital communication systems, and in particular,<br>
performance improvements for existing and future digital communication systems.<br>
The IMT-2000 standard recommends using a bit reverse interleaver for a channel<br>
interleaver. However, this interleaver can have various sizes, and the forward link and<br>
the reverse link defined by the IMT-2000 standard can have various types of logical<br>
channels. Therefore, in order to provide the ranges of the IMT-2000 standard, an<br>
increased memory capacity is required for the interleaver memory. For example, in an<br>
N=3 forward link transmission mode, interleavers with various sizes, such as between<br>
144 bits/frame to 36,864 bits/frame, can be used. A brief description of the bit reversal<br>
interleaver is presented below.<br>
In FIG. 1, a block diagram illustrates a permutation method of the bit reversal interleaver.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, bit reversal interleaving is a technique for generating an interleaving<br>
address by exchanging bit positions from the most significant bit (MSB) to the least<br>
significant bit (LSB) of an address. This interleaving method includes a number of<br>
advantages. First, since the interleaver can be implemented using an enumeration<br>
function, it is simple to use the memory and it is easy to implement interleaves with<br>
various sizes. In addition, the bit positions of the permutated sequence are distributed at<br>
random in major locations. However, an interleaver having a size which cannot be<br>
expressed in terms of a power of 2 has low memory efficiency. For example, in order to<br>
implement a 36,864-bit interleaver, a 64Kbit (65,536=216) memory is required. This is<br>
because the largest integer which can be expressed in terms of a power of 2 among<br>
integers smaller than 36,864, is 65,536. Therefore, 28,672 (65,536-36,864) bits are<br>
unused in the interleaver memory, thereby causing a memory loss. In addition, even<br>
though the memory has a sufficient capacity, it is very difficult to implement a method<br>
for transmitting the symbols. Further, it is difficult for a receiver to detect accurate<br>
positions of the received symbols. Finally, since various types of interleavers are used, it<br>
is necessary to store various interleaving rules in memory thereby requiring a controller,<br>
such as a central processing unit (CPU), to have a high memory capacity as well.<br>
Conventional interleaving methods have a number of additional disadvantages as well.<br>
First, in existing interleaving methods, the size of the interleaver cannot be expressed in<br>
terms of a power of 2, and the interleaver having the largest size has the lowest memory<br>
efficiency level. That is. in designing an interleaver for an IMT-2000 forward link, the<br>
size of each logical channel is not expressed in terms of 2m, and the interleaver has a<br>
large size. Therefore, it is inefficient to use the bit reversal interleaving method.<br>
Second, in existing interleaving methods, it is typically necessary to store various<br>
interleaving rules, or instructions, according to the interleaver sizes in the controller,<br>
CPU or host of a transceiver. Therefore, the host memory requires separate instruction<br>
storage in addition to an interleaver buffer.<br>
Third, if the size of the interleaver is set to 2m in order to use the bit reversal interleaving<br>
method, it is necessary to delete unnecessary invalid addresses. Therefore, the<br>
interleaver has a complex transmission method and has difficulty in acquiring symbol<br>
synchronization during realization.<br>
Accordingly, a need exists for an interleaving apparatus and method which provides a<br>
memory efficient interleaver which can use a bit reversal interleaving technique without<br>
undue complexity.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide an interleaving apparatus<br>
and method for generating interleaving addresses for various interleaver sizes through a<br>
single algorithm in a communication system.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide an interleaving apparatus and<br>
method that is more memory efficient and requires only as much interleaver memory<br>
capacity as a frame size N in a communication system.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide an apparatus and method for<br>
interleaving input data with an interleaver size of N=2mxj+a (where 0<a in a></a>
communication system.<br>
These and other objects are substantially achieved by providing an interleaving<br>
apparatus and method which employ the operations of determining a new interleaver<br>
size N'=2mx(j+1) and addresses of 0 to N'-l, if a given interleaver size N is larger than<br>
2mxj and smaller than 2mx(j+l), sequentially storing N input data bits in a memory with<br>
the new interleaver size N' from an address 0 to an address N-l, performing a Partial Bit<br>
Reversal Order (PBRO),interleaving the memory with the new interleaver size N\ and<br>
reading data from the memory by deleting addresses corresponding to addresses of N to<br>
N'-l of the memory before interleaving.<br>
The apparatus and method further provides for interleaving input data with N=2mxj+a<br>
(where 0<a in a communication system. the apparatus and method employ></a>
operations of determining addresses in a sequential column direction of a memory with<br>
an RxC matrix structure of N'=2mx(j+1), storing the input data in a sequential column<br>
direction in the memory from an address 0 to an address N-l, and, where no input data is<br>
stored in (2m-a) areas corresponding to addresses of N to N'-l in a last column of the<br>
memory, generating output addresses with the RxC matrix .structure by PBRO-<br>
interleaving the determined addresses. The apparatus and method further generates a<br>
read address for reading data stored in the memory by determining the output addresses<br>
in the sequential column direction, where the generated read address excludes output<br>
addresses corresponding to the addresses of N to N'-l.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED<br>
EMBODIMENTS<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention is described below with reference to<br>
the accompanying drawings. In the following description, well-known functions or<br>
constructions known to those skilled in the art are not described in detail for conciseness.<br>
During operation, an interleaver/deinterleaver according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention permutates the sequence of input . symbols with an<br>
interleaving/deinterleaving algorithm. The sequence of symbols are then stored in an<br>
output buffer in a new sequence. Therefore, the interleaver/deinterleaver described<br>
below includes at least an interleaver memory, such as an input data buffer and output<br>
data buffer, an address generator, and a general counter.<br>
The interleaver memory, address generator and counter of the interleaver/deinterleaver<br>
are shown in FIG. 2, which illustrates an example of a structure of an interleaver 200<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 2, an address<br>
generator 211 generates an interleaving address for reading bit symbols sequentially<br>
stored in an interleaver memory 212 by receiving an interleaver size N, a first parameter<br>
"irf (or BIT_SHIFT parameter), a second parameter 'j' (or UP_LIMIT parameter) and a<br>
clock. The interleaver memory 212 sequentially stores input bit symbols in a write mode<br>
of operation, and outputs bit symbols according to an address provided from the address<br>
generator 211 in a read mode of operation. A counter 213 counts the input clock signal<br>
214 and provides a clock count value to the interleaver memory 212 as a write address.<br>
As described above, the interleaver 200 sequentially writes input data in the interleaver<br>
memory 212 in the write mode of operation, and outputs the data stored in the<br>
interleaver memory 212 according to a read address generated from the address<br>
generator 211.<br>
Here, the address generator 211 generates the read address, or an interleaving address,<br>
according to a partial bit reversal (PBRO) interleaving algorithm defined below as<br>
equation (1).<br>
In equation (1), 'k' represents a sequence number between zero and N-l, (0 
indicating the sequence of an output data bit, 'm' represents a first parameter indicating<br>
the number of consecutive zero (0) bits from the LSB to the MSB, and 'j' represents a<br>
second parameter corresponding to a decimal value of the bits other than the consecutive<br>
zero bits. Here, the interleaver size N is defined as 2mxj.<br>
A description will now be made regarding a method of generating an interleaving<br>
address for reading input symbols sequentially written in an interleaver memory 212<br>
with reference to Equation (1). If, as in the example above, the size of the interleaver is<br>
N, then in equation (1), k (=0,1,2, •••, N-l) indicates a time index of the input data, and a<br>
third parameter 'r', PUC, and a fourth parameter 's' indicate predetermined parameters.<br>
Further, 'mod' and 7" indicate modulo operation and divider operation for calculating a<br>
remainder and a quotient, respectively. In addition, BRO(H) indicates a bit reversal<br>
function for converting 'H' to a binary format and then converting it to a decimal value<br>
by reverse ordering the binary value from the MSB to the LSB. Therefore, by using the<br>
function of equation (1), the interleaver 200 may calculate a read sequence index<br>
ADDRESS_READ corresponding to the input data sequence 'k' and read the contents of<br>
the memory according to the read sequence index ADDRESSREAD. The first<br>
parameter 'm' and the second parameter 'j" are determined according to the interleaver<br>
size. Once the interleaver size N, the first parameter 'm' and the second parameter °j" are<br>
determined, the interleaver generates, depending on these values, a new addressing index<br>
ADDRESS_READ corresponding to each *k' according to the following algorithm, and<br>
reads data from the interleaver memory 212 using the addressing index<br>
ADDRESS_READ.<br>
A description will now be made regarding a method for determining the first parameter<br>
'm' and the second parameter 'j' from the frame size (or interleaver size) N. For a<br>
predetermined interleaver size N is expressed in a binary value. Further, the maximum<br>
number of consecutive '0' bits from the LSB to the MSB is calculated, and this value is<br>
defined as the first parameter 'm'. In addition, the second parameter 'j' is defined by<br>
gathering truncated bits, excluding the consecutive '0' bits, and converting them to a<br>
decimal number. For example, if N=576, it can be expressed in a binary value of N=[10<br>
0100 0000]. Therefore, m=6 and j=( 1001 )2=9.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates a structure of a deinterleaver 300 corresponding to the interleaver 200<br>
described above. Referring to FIG. 3, an address generator 311 generates an interleaver<br>
memory address for performing a write mode of operation by receiving an interleaver<br>
size value N, a BIT_SHIFT value (i.e., first parameter 'm'), an UPLIMIT value (i.e.,<br>
second parameter 'j') and a clock, and provides the generated interleaver memory<br>
address to a deinterleaver memory 312. The deinterleaver memory 312 stores input data<br>
according to the write address provided from the address generator 311 in a write mode<br>
of operation, and sequentially outputs the stored data in a read mode of operation. A<br>
counter 313 counts the input clock 314 and provides the clock count value to the<br>
deinterleaver memory 312 as a read address value.<br>
The deinterleaver 300 has substantially the same structure as the interleaver 200<br>
described above, and performs the reverse operation of the interleaver 200. That is, the<br>
deinterleaver 300 is different from the interleaver 200 in that input data is stored in the<br>
deinterleaver memory 312 using the algorithm of equation (1) in the write mode of<br>
operation, and the data is sequentially read in the read mode of operation. The<br>
deinterleaver 300 stores the data in the original sequence in the write mode of operation<br>
in order to restore the original sequence of the data transmitted from the transmitter.<br>
For convenience, the description below will now be made with reference to the<br>
interleaver 200. Reference will be made to an embodiment which is applied to either an<br>
IMT-2000 or a Code Division Multiple Access 2000 (CDMA-2000) system.<br>
First, with reference to Table 1 below, a detailed description will be made regarding the<br>
interleaver size used in the forward link of the IMT-2000 system.<br>
In Table 1, F-FCH stands for a forward fundamental channel, F-SCH for a forward<br>
supplemental channel, F-CCCH for a forward common control channel, F-SYNC CH for<br>
a forward sync channel, F-PCH for a forward paging channel, and F-DCCH for a<br>
forward dedicated control channel.<br>
It is noted from Table I that the IMT-2000 system proposes 12 interleaver sizes (N=12)<br>
each applied to the forward logical channels as indicated by 'O'. For example, a forward<br>
fundamental channel F-FCH (Rate Set 2) uses 144-bit, 576-bit and 1,152-bit interleaver<br>
sizes. Here, a 5ms frame is used for the 144-bit interleaver size.<br>
Table 2 below shows a first parameter 'm' and a second parameter 'j' calculated for the<br>
interleaver sizes of Table 1.<br>
TABLE 2<br>
With reference to Table 2, a description regarding calculating BIT_SHIFT and<br>
UP_LIMIT for the interleaver size of N=9,216 is presented below. First, the interleaver<br>
size, 9,216, can be expressed as a binary value of N=[10 0100 0000 0000]. For this<br>
binary value, the maximum number of consecutive zero (0) bits from the LSB to the<br>
MSB is calculated, and the calculated value is defined as the first parameter 'm' (or<br>
BIT_SHIFT). Thereafter, the truncated bits, excluding the consecutive zero bits, are assembled<br>
and converted to a decimal value (1001=9(10)). This decimal is the UP_LIMIT(9).<br>
Tables 3 and 4 below illustrate a write mode and a read mode for an N=576 interleaver,<br>
respectively, by way of example.<br>
In the write mode of operation, the input data bits are sequentially stored in the<br>
interleaver memory 212 from an address 0 to an address 574, as shown in Table 3. Next,<br>
in the read mode of operation, the data bits are output from the interleaver memory 212<br>
using the read address generated from the address generator 211.<br>
The third output data bit (k=2) can also be described with reference to equation (1). First,<br>
for N=576, BIT_SHIFT=6 and UP_LIMIT=9. Therefore, r=2 mod 9=2, and PUC=2/9=0.<br>
In addition, s=BRO(0)=0. As a result, the finally calculated address ADDRESS_READ=<br>
2x26+0=128. However, since Table 4 shows read addresses from 1 to N, a valid address<br>
is determined by adding 1 to the calculated address.<br>
The above-stated PBRO interleaving operation has been described with reference to a<br>
case where the interleaver size N is equal to 2mxj determined by the first parameter ;m'<br>
and the second parameter "j\ However, if the interleaver size N is larger than 2mxj and<br>
smaller than 2mx(j+l), the PBRO interleaving operation must be performed, in a different<br>
way. That is, if the interleaver size N is 2mxj+a, it is necessary to perform another<br>
interleaving operation. Here, 'a' is a positive number larger than 0 and smaller than 2m<br>
(0<a in realization of the system there is a case where interleaver size not></a>
equal to 2mxj according to a characteristic of an upper layer, or the first parameter 'm' is<br>
too small, even though the interleaver size is equal to 2mxj. In this case, the interleaver<br>
may not have a PBRO characteristic, so another interleaving operation is required. If the<br>
interleaver size is 384=27x3, the first and second parameters can be defined as m=7 and<br>
j=3, respectively. However, in the case where the interleaver size is 406==27x3+22, the<br>
interleaver size cannot be expressed in terms of 2mxj, although the first and second<br>
parameters are defined as m=7 and j=3, respectively. Since a possible interleaver size<br>
that can be expressed in terms of 2mxj is 2x(26x3+ll) =2x203, the first and second<br>
parameters can be defined as m=l and j=203, respectively. Actually, however, if m=l,<br>
the PBRO characteristic is not provided.<br>
Table 5 below illustrates a case where the PBRO interleaving is possible according to<br>
the interleaver size and a case where the PBRO interleaving is not possible according to<br>
the interleaver size. Specifically, Table 5 illustrates parameters m and j' determined for 6<br>
interleaver sizes of 406, 790, 1,558, 2,326, 3,094, and 3,862 with a=22.<br>
"Perfect Cases", shown in the left column of Table 5, represent the cases where the<br>
PBRO interleaving is possible, since the interleaver size is N=Nmax, such as 384, 768,<br>
1,536, 2,304, 3,072 and 3,840. However, "Imperfect Cases", shown in the right column<br>
of Table 5, represent the cases where the PBRO characteristic is lost, "Discard"<br>
represents the number of addresses to be deleted among output interleaving addresses.<br>
Therefore, the present invention will provide a method for enabling the PBRO<br>
interleaving for any interleaver size illustrated in Table 5.<br>
FIG. 4 is a flowchart illustrating an example of a PBRO interleaving process for an<br>
interleaver 200 according to an embodiment of the present invention. Specifically, FIG.<br>
4 illustrates a procedure for performing PBRO interleaving with respect to the<br>
interleaver sizes belonging to "Imperfect Cases" in Table 5. This procedure includes the<br>
steps of storing input data in the interleaver memory 212 according to a write address, a<br>
count value from the counter 213, and reading the data stored in the interleaver memory<br>
212 according to a read address generated by the address generator 211. A method of<br>
generating a write address by the counter 213 is well known to those skilled in the art, so<br>
a description will not be provided. Instead, a detailed description will be made of a<br>
method for generating a read address by the address generator 211 of the interleaver 200.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, the address generator 211 determines an interleaver size N in step<br>
401. The interleaver size N is equal to a size of data to be interleaved. Thereafter, the<br>
address generator 211 calculates the maximum Nmax value satisfying 2mxj among<br>
Nmax values being smaller than the interleaver size N in step 403, and calculates a first<br>
parameter m and a second parameter j satisfying Nmax=2mxj using the PBRO<br>
interleaving method applicable to the "Perfect Cases" of Table 5 in step 405.<br>
The address generator 211 then determines j' by adding 1 to the second parameter j in<br>
step 407, and initializes a parameter k in step 409. As described above, k represents a<br>
read sequence. Thereafter, in step 411, the address generator 211 defines a new<br>
interleaver size N'=2mxj'=2mx(j+1) from the m and the j'=j+l. Here, the new interleaver<br>
size has a relationship of N'&gt;N&gt;Nmax. Thereafter, the address generator calculates an<br>
output address PBRO(k) with the PBRO interleaving method according to the first<br>
parameter m and the second parameter j.<br>
According to an embodiment of the present invention, a series of information symbols<br>
(input data) received in a write mode of operation are sequentially stored in the<br>
interleaver memory from an address 0 to an address N-l. Therefore, the interleaver<br>
requires a memory of size N. That is, although the interleaver may be designed such that<br>
the interleaver memory has additional areas from an address N to an address N'-l, these<br>
memory areas are unused. This write operation is performed by generating a write<br>
address by the counter 213 of FIG. 2. The counter 213 serves as a write address<br>
generator.<br>
In the embodiment of the present invention described above, the address generator<br>
performs PBRO interleaving of equation (1) using the new interleaver size N' in a read<br>
mode of operation to generate a read address PBRO(k) for an output sequence k, and<br>
then reads the information symbols sequentially stored in the interleaver memory<br>
according to the generated read address.<br>
While performing in the read mode, the address generator determines in step 413<br>
whether the generated read address PBRO(k) is larger than N-l. If the generated<br>
PBRO(k) is larger than N-l, the address generator discards the generated read address in<br>
step 423. Otherwise, if the generated read address PBRO(k) is smaller than or equal to<br>
N-l, the address generator reads the data stored at the generated read address in step 415.<br>
Thereafter, the address generator increases the parameter k representing the output<br>
sequence by 1 in step 417, and determines in step 419 whether the parameter k is larger<br>
than 2mxj'-l (or N'-l). If the parameter k is smaller than or equal to 2mxj'-l, the address<br>
generator returns to step 411 in order to continuously generate a read address. However,<br>
if the parameter k is larger than 2mxj'-l, the address generator ends the read address<br>
generation operation in step 421. Among the generated read addresses, an address larger<br>
than or equal to the interleaver size N is discarded. Therefore, as many addresses as the<br>
number N of input bit symbols can be used as final read addresses for interleaving.<br>
In addition, Table 5 shows the parameters m and j' determined for each of the 6<br>
interleaver sizes of 406, 790, 1,558, 2,326, 3,094, and 3,862. As illustrated in Table 5, j'<br>
is larger by +1 than j calculated from the Nmax.<br>
FIG. 5 illustrates a method for performing a PBRO interleaving operation, belonging to<br>
the "Imperfect Cases", using the m and the j' illustrated in Table 5. Referring to FIG. 5,<br>
22 bit symbols are added to a last column 501, and 2m-22 addresses, determined by<br>
excluding 22 elements from the elements in the last column, are unused. Therefore, after<br>
the PBRO interleaving is performed, the bit symbols belonging to this part are deleted. If<br>
it is assumed that input data with an interleaver size N=2mxj+a (where 0<a the></a>
input data is sequentially stored in a column direction in the address memory from an<br>
address 0 to an address N-l, and at this moment, no input data is stored in (2m-a) areas<br>
corresponding to the addresses of N to N'-l.<br>
FIG. 6 illustrates a PBRO interleaving operation for an interleaver size N=406 according<br>
to an embodiment of the present invention. For an interleaver size N=406, the Nmax is<br>
384=27x3 as illustrated in Table 5, and the first and second parameters are defined as<br>
m=7 and j=3, respectively. Therefore, j'=j+l=4. In the write mode of operation, the<br>
interleaver 200 sequentially stores 0th to 40th input bit symbols in the interleaver memory<br>
as illustrated in FIG. 6. Since the remaining bit symbols do not exist, they are<br>
represented by X in the drawing. The interleaver sequentially stores 406 input bit<br>
symbols in a column direction in an interleaver memory having a shape of an RxC<br>
(=27x(3+l)) matrix. Here, only 22 bit symbols are stored in the last (j-H-i)th column, and<br>
no bit symbol is stored at the remaining 106 addresses.<br>
The interleaver 200 performs PBRO interleaving according to equation (1) in a read<br>
mode of operation. If an output address is larger than or equal to the interleaver size of<br>
406, the interleaver does not output the corresponding output address. Therefore, the<br>
proposed interleaver outputs exactly N=406 addresses and has an interleaver memory<br>
with a size N=406.<br>
Another application of the embodiment of the present invention described above can be<br>
applied to a case where input data with N=2mxj+a (where 0<a is interleaved. such></a>
an interleaving operation is achieved by first determining addresses in a sequential<br>
column direction of a memory with a matrix structure of N'=2mx(j+1). Next, the input<br>
data is stored in the sequential column direction in the memory from an address 0 to an<br>
address N-l. Here, no data is stored in (2m-a) areas corresponding to the addresses from<br>
N to N'-l in the last column of the memory. The determined addresses then undergo<br>
PBRO interleaving to generate output address having an RxC matrix. The output<br>
addresses are determined in the sequential column direction to generate a read address<br>
for reading data stored in the memory. Here, as in the generated read address, the output<br>
addresses corresponding to the addresses from N to N'-l are deleted.<br>
Tables 5 and 6 illustrate parameters m and j' needed to perform PBRO<br>
interleaving corresponding to "Imperfect Cases" according to another<br>
embodiment of the present invention. As shown above, Earlier, Table 5<br>
illustrated parameters m and j' determined for 6 interleaver sizes of 406, 790,<br>
1,558, 2,326, 3,094, and 3,862 with a=22.<br>
Table 6 illustrates parameters m and j' determined for 6 interleaver sizes of 408, 792,<br>
1560, 2328, 3096, and 3864 with a=24.<br>
When the interleaver size corresponds to "Imperfect Cases", deinterleaving is performed<br>
in a reverse process of the interleaving process which has been described in conjunction<br>
with PBRO interleaving and deinterleaving. That is, in the deinterleaving process, a<br>
write address is generated using the procedure of FIG. 4 for generating a read address,<br>
which was used in the interleaving process. Therefore, although a write address is<br>
generated with a new interleaver being larger in size than an actual interleaver,<br>
unnecessary addresses are deleted from the generated write address, and the memory<br>
then stores as many data bits as the actual interleaver size.<br>
As described above, the present invention provides a method for effectively generating<br>
addresses for various interieaver sizes which cannot be expressed in terms of a power of<br>
2, thereby contributing to an increase in memory inefficiency of the interieaver. In<br>
addition, an address for the various interieaver sizes can be generated with a single<br>
algorithm, preventing a waste of memory capacity caused by storing interleaving rules<br>
for the respective interieaver sizes in the CPU. Further, the present invention contributes<br>
to an increase in memory efficiency, since the proposed interieaver requires as much<br>
memory capacity as the size N of a frame.<br>
While the invention has been shown and described with reference to certain<br>
embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various<br>
changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and<br>
scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. For example, although the<br>
present invention has been described with reference to the case where the value 'a' is 22<br>
and 24, the invention can be applied even to a case where the value 'a' is smaller than 2'n.<br>
