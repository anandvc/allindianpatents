NOVEL COMBINATIONS OF MEDICAMENTS FOR THE TREATMENT OF<br>
RESPIRATORY DISEASES<br>
The present invention relates to new medicament combinations, which contain, in addition to one or more, preferably one compound of general formula 1<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein the groups R1, R2 and R3 may have the meanings given in the claims and in the specification, at least one other active substance 2, processes for preparing them and their use as pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel pharmaceutical compositions based on long-acting anticholinergic compounds and long-acting ß-mimetics, processes for preparing them and respiratory complaints.<br>
It is known from the prior art that ß-mimetics and anticholinergics may be used successfully in combination as bronchospasmolytics for the treatment of obstructive respiratory complaints - such as e.g. asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. For drug treatment of diseases it is often desirable to prepare medicaments with a longer duration of activity. As a rule, this ensures that the concentration of the active substance in the body needed to achieve the therapeutic effect is present over a longer period of time without the need to administer the drug repeatedly, frequently. The administration of an active substance at longer intervals of time also contributes considerably to the patient's<br>
wellbeing. It is particularly desirable to provide a pharmaceutical composition which can be used to therapeutically good effect by administering it once a day (single dose). A single application per day has the advantage that the patient can become accustomed relatively quickly to the regular taking of the medicament at a particular time of the day.<br>
However, the administration of substances with a ß-sympathomimetic activity -such as e.g. The active substance formoterol which is also known from the prior art - may be associated with undesirable side effects in humans.<br>
Examples of central effects include general malaise, agitation, insomnia, anxiety, trembling fingers, sweating and headaches. Administration by inhalation does not eliminate these side effects, but generally they are somewhat less severe than after oral or parenteral administration.<br>
The side effects of the ß-sympathomimetics after administration by inhalation are, however, based predominantly on the more or less marked ß1-stimulant effects on the heart. After systemic availability ß-sympathomimetics give rise to tachycardia, palpitations, angina pectoris-like pain as well as arrhythmias [Jackson and Lipworth, Drug Safety 2004: 24, 243-270; Sovani et at., Drug Safety 2004: 27, 689-715].<br>
The aim of the present invention is therefore to provide novel pharmaceutical compositions based on anticholinergic compounds and long-acting ß-mimetics, which on the one hand have a therapeutic benefit in the treatment of respiratory complaints and are characterised by a long duration of activity, while simultaneously reducing the potential for side effects of the ß-mimetic and may thus be used to prepare pharmaceutical compositions with a longer-lasting activity and a low side effect profile.<br>
Surprisingly it has been found that the aims outlined above can be achieved by means of compounds of general formula 1.<br>

FORMULATIONS<br>
The two active substance components 1 and 2 may be administered - together or separately - in each case by inhalation or by oral, parenteral or some other route, in known manner, in substantially conventional formulations such as for example plain or coated tablets, pills, granules, aerosols, syrups, emulsions, suspensions, powders and solutions, using inert, non-toxic, pharmaceutically suitable carriers or solvents.<br>
Suitable preparations for administering the compounds of formula 1 and 2 include tablets, capsules, suppositories, solutions, powders, etc. The proportion of pharmaceutically active compound or compounds should be in the range from 0.05 to 90 % by weight, preferably 0.1 to 50 % by weight of the total composition. Suitable tablets may be obtained, for example, by mixing the active substance(s) with known excipients, for example inert diluents such as calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or lactose, disintegrants such as corn starch or alginic acid, binders such as starch or gelatine, lubricants such as magnesium stearate or talc and/or agents for delaying release, such as carboxymethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate phthalate, or polyvinyl acetate. The tablets may also comprise several layers.<br>
Coated tablets may be prepared accordingly by coating cores produced analogously to the tablets with substances normally used for tablet coatings, for example collidone or shellac, gum arable, talc, titanium dioxide or sugar. To<br>
achieve delayed release or prevent incompatibilities the core may also consist of a number of layers. Similarly the tablet coating may consist of a number or layers to achieve delayed release, possibly using the excipients mentioned above for the tablets.<br>
Syrups or elixirs containing the active substances or combinations of active substances according to the invention may additionally contain a sweetener such as saccharine, cyclamate, glycerol or sugar and a flavour enhancer, e.g. a flavouring such as vanillin or orange extract. They may also contain suspension adjuvants or thickeners such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, wetting agents such as, for example, condensation products of fatty alcohols with ethylene oxide, or preservatives such as p-hydroxybenzoates.<br>
Solutions are prepared in the usual way, e.g. with the addition of isotonic agents, preservatives such as p-hydroxybenzoates, or stabilisers such as alkali metal salts of ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, optionally using emulsifiers and/or dispersants, whilst if water is used as the diluent, for example, organic solvents may optionally be used as solvating agents or dissolving aids, and transferred into injection vials or ampoules or infusion bottles.<br>
Capsules containing one or more active substances or combinations of active substances may for example be prepared by mixing the active substances with inert carriers such as lactose or sorbitol and packing them into gelatine capsules. Suitable suppositories may be made for example by mixing with carriers provided for this purpose, such as neutral fats or polyethyleneglycol or the derivatives thereof.<br>
Excipients which may be used include, for example, water, pharmaceutically acceptable organic solvents such as paraffins (e.g. petroleum fractions), vegetable oils (e.g. groundnut or sesame oil), mono- or polyfunctional alcohols (e.g. ethanol or glycerol), carriers such as e.g. natural mineral powders (e.g. kaolins, clays, talc, chalk), synthetic mineral powders (e.g. highly dispersed silicic acid and silicates),<br>
sugars (e.g. cane sugar, lactose and glucose), emulsifiers (e.g. lignin, spent sulphite liquors, methylcellulose, starch and polyvinylpyrrolidone) and lubricants (e.g. magnesium stearate, talc, stearic acid and sodium lauryl sulphate).<br>
For oral administration the tablets may, of course, contain, apart from the abovementioned carriers, additives such as sodium citrate, calcium carbonate and dicalcium phosphate together with various additives such as starch, preferably potato starch, gelatine and the like. Moreover, lubricants such as magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulphate and talc may be used at the same time for the tabletting process. In the case of aqueous suspensions the active substances may be combined with various flavour enhancers or colourings in addition to the excipients mentioned above.<br>
Preferably, even when the two components 1 and 2 are administered separately, at least component 1 is administered by inhalation. If component 1 is administered by inhalation, when the two active substances are taken separately, component 2 may also be administered for example by oral or parenteral route using formulations conventional in the art such as plain or coated tablets, pills, granules, aerosols, syrups, emulsions, suspensions, powders and solutions, using inert, non-toxic, pharmaceutically suitable carriers or solvents.<br>
Preferably, however, the medicament combinations according to the invention are administered by inhalation by means of a single preparation containing both active substances 1 and 2 or by means of separate preparations each containing only one of the active substances 1 and 2, suitable for administration by inhalation.<br>
Inhalable preparations include inhalable powders, propellant-containing metered dose aerosols or propellant-free inhalable solutions. Inhalable powders according to the invention containing the combination of active substances 1 and 2 may consist of the active substances on their own or of a mixture of the active substances with physiologically acceptable excipients. Within the scope of the<br>
present invention, the term propellant-free inhalable solutions also includes concentrates or sterile inhalable solutions ready for use.
